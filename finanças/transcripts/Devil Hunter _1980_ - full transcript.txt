What's your opinion of your co-star in your last film? Is it true you're intimate? Not true, we're just good friends. What's the reason for your visit here, Ms. Crawford? We're checking out locations for our next film. Excuse me, could you give me an opinion on the men in our country? I have no opinion of men. I just love them. - Oh, I see. - Tomorrow evening at five. - Okay. Oh, that's perfect. I like it very much. What about showing her the orchid number? No, it's not her style at all. I think this is more to your taste. Ooh, sweetie. Mommy's darling. Who is that? Is that you, Jane? Who are you? What do you want from me? Get out of here at once. Forcer, will you come and collect the luggage from room number 312 please? Okay, that's fine. Everything's all right. We'll catch a plane within an hour, you better get ready. Go on, Chris. Now don't push me. Stop beefing and let's go. I have Mr. Weston on the line, will you speak to him? Put him on. My dear Peter, nice to hear from you. I can't return the compliment. Ah. Come on Peter, you must get here as soon as possible. I need you. - I don't need you. Damn shit. What a fuckin' awful place. It doesn't worry me. You know, back in my country, we have these flowers. And we used to offer them to the virgin. Flowers, shit. Isn't it beautiful? You're just an idiot. Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit! What's the matter, Chris? That's my business, you bitch! Calm down. I'll do exactly as I please. I was against coming here in the first place. This wild vegetation gives me the creeps. I can't take it any longer! Try to control yourself. Ah, shit! We don't like this place anymore than you do. Ugh, I'm sure. He won't come up with the dough. He couldn't care less about her. He'll pay, you can bet your life he'll pay. Ugh. Why don't we send him a piece of her? That'll convince him to pay up. What do you think? Would he be convinced then? - 200 thou. - Out of the question, Peter. It's too much. 200 thou and expenses or I don't move. Alright, as you wish. $6 million is a lot of money even for a girl who's a star. She's not just a star, she's an investment. We spent a lot of money on her publicity. I can understand why you wanna pay. Eh, we have no option. And we pay and use $100 bills, as requested. Well that's your business. Yeah, I'm quite aware it is my business, I'm the one in the hot seat. I don't envy you. And remember, Peter, I don't want her to run any risk at all. I understand. Very well, as you wish. Peter. If you bring back Laura and the $6 million, the 10% of that sum is yours. Not a bad offer, I'll do my best. I know you will. That's why I called you. Get outta here! Don't you boss me! I'm not taking orders from you, I already told you. You too, get outta here. Oh please, please leave me alone! Please, please! - Hey, what's going on? - Thomas is having some fun. - Can I help you, sir? - I have an appointment. Mr. Frazer. I'm sorry, there is no Mr. Frazer registered with us. But there must be, would you mind checking again, it's very important. As you wish. He's not here, I'm terribly sorry. Mr. Weston. This is for you. Puerto Santo Anna, at the rocky beach near the ruin temple. That's our island. So what now? We land, what else? Hey! Thomas! Thomas! There's the beach. That's a helicopter. That's right. That's money. Those drums are driving me crazy! Shut up, you idiots. Don't realize that helicopter represents $6 million? My gun. Good idea. We'll be waiting for them. Let's go down and meet them. Down the beach? Wait! Come back here! It's better they come to us. I'm landing on the beach. Why you carrying a gun, you're not in Vietnam. I'll feel safer. Let's go. Peter! What's the matter, Jack? It was just like this place, all those bombs. Oh, oh my poor head. I hate the jungle and its humidity. Calm down, it's all over now. And these shadows. - We're not in Vietnam now. - Oh, this heat. C'mon. The blood was all over the place. I can't take it, not again! Get me outta here! I can't get these painful memories outta my head! Calm down, c'mon, you must enjoy yourself. Wait a minute. Let me take a pill. - Okay. - That'll be better. It'll steady my nerves. - C'mon. - I'm sorry, Peter. But I just can't get it outta my mind. I was the only one who survived. You know that? The only one. I know, I know. You'll get over it in time, I promise. Jesus, what a sight. Poor little girl. - Could it be cannibals? I guess so. Let's get a move on. I wasn't really expecting any of this. C'mon, let's go. Have you brought the money? Where is Ms. Crawford? Laura's with me, safe and sound. No more questions. Have you brought the money, yes or no? Yes, but I don't have it with me. When I get the girl, you get the money and not before. You'll get the girl, but I want my money here. No, we'll meet you in an hour down at the beach. And bring the girl with you. Remember, no tricks, is that clear? Very well. Hope they fall for it. Which is the right bag? This one. Let's hope they don't keep us waiting too long. There they are. Come towards me slowly, bringing the money with you. I'm coming to meet you in the open. Ms. Crawford will stay right here until I checked out that's everything's in order. There's no deal unless you bring the girl with you, and come unarmed. Okay, as you wish. If they discover the trick, they'll kill the girl. That's a risk we'll have to take. Careful of the others. Be careful, Peter. I don't trust them, it looks like a trap to me. Get down. Don't move from here no matter what happens, get me? Huh? You get the money when I get the girl. Alright. You alright, Jack? They've hit the motor. We'll have to bail out, otherwise we'll crash with the copter. Sons of bitches. All fool me. If they think they can double-cross me, we getter back to the bay where our boat's anchored. If one of them survives, that's the direction they'll be making for. What about Laura Crawford? I'll take care of her. Get going on and step on it. - How you feeling? - It hurts a little, but not too much. - Can you move around? - Yeah, I think I can. It's pretty painful, but I'll make it. I must say we were lucky. They coulda killed us both. C'mon. Let's go. Let's find their hiding place, before they realize we're alive. C'mon. Listen, there's something funny. The birds are all quiet, no noise. C'mon. What strange footprints! Whose could they be, they hardly look human! Let's go on. Chris? Chris? Chris! Chris? That boat must belong to those sons of bitches. Maybe it is. Perhaps we should go aboard. You think you can make it to the boat? - I guess I can. - Alright, let's go. - What was that? - A girl. - What happened? - She started screaming, I had to knock her out, what else could I do? I hope the others didn't hear her scream. I doubt it, they couldn't have heard. Ouch. - Where's Chris? - He's dead. - How did it happen? - I don't know. He was ahead of me, and then he disappeared. And then I found his body dangling from a tree. And then, then his head fell off. - His head fell? - Ah! Yes, fell right on top of me. It was horrible, horrible! Did you see the guys in the copter? No, but I know they're alive, and one of them is wounded. Calm down, Pablito. Control yourself, for God's sake. Listen, we could do nothing for Chris now, do you understand? But we must get organized and find those two bastards before they do any more harm to us. C'mon, Pablito, control yourself! Don't be afraid, it's all right, we're not gonna hurt you. Would you like a drop? It'll do you good. Haven't we met before? A bit too strong, ey? Yes, a bit. What are you doing on this boat, and why did you pull a gun on me? I'm the one who gave you the message to come here. Well go on. I didn't know it was to do with a kidnapping. We'll take care of you. I'm afraid, I'm scared. Afraid of what? There's a tribe in the area. They sacrifice human beings. The victims are usually young girls, and they eat their hearts. And they leave them to rot. Like the girl we saw earlier. Gives me the shivers thinking about it. White skin is more highly sought of by the god of this wild tribe. I see. Oh, my head aches. How do you know about this tribe's rites? You see, my father lived in this area. He told me all about this tribe. When they catch a young girl, they sacrifice her to their god, who eats her heart. Rest now and don't worry about it. Thank you. We're in a pretty good position. We know where they are and they don't know where we are, and that's always an advantage. And Laura Crawford? We still got the six million. You mean you wanna trade with them? Not if I can help it. Why not? 'Cause 10% of it's mine. Yours? You mean you're getting 10% if you return the money? Mm-hm. How did you manage to get that deal? I know Goldstein too well. He cares about the girl, there's no doubt about it, but he cares about the money just as much. So I convinced him that, for a percentage, I'd get them both back. Whew. Goldstein must trust you and have faith in your capabilities. Oh well... - Huh? - Did you hear that? What could it be? I don't know. Listen, we better continue our search tomorrow. I think you're right. Damn you! Calm down and know what you're shooting at. C'mon, let's get outta here. What happened? I heard shots. - Nothing. Just that Pablito lost his nerve. Anyway, it's getting late. We better rest up before we go on searching. - How's the girl? - Okay. She's resting now. Look what I found. Oh, a walkie-talkie. Who the hell's that? What's wrong? Those two must've gotten to our boat. The ones from the helicopter? I know it's you on the other end of this walkie-talkie, Weston. What the hell do you want from me? I'm pretty sure it's a surprise to you, but it's me, Peter Weston. Wanna thank you for your warm welcome you gave us on the beach. Very funny, ha-ha. But if you want the girl back, get the money ready. Bring the girl to the boat and we'll settle up. So you do have the money, Mr. Weston. I've got it. I might've known. But this time no funny money, I won't accept it. Is that clear? If you care for the girl's life, you better play clean, get me? That Weston won't give up the money unless we produce the girl, and where in the hell are we gonna find her, I'd like to know? Don't worry, we'll find her. Easy to say. We've been searching this lousy jungle for hours without finding a trace of her. We mustn't give up, it's our only hope. Yes, but didn't you talk about resting before we started up again? I know, but we must carry on. With Weston on the boat, we've no time for resting up. We've got to find the girl. Wait, Thomas, wait for me. You can't go out on a search now, it's too dangerous. Hm. Leave us alone, Pablito. You're a son of a bitch, but I love you. Keep your eyes wide open. Don't worry, Peter. And don't forget, you're sitting on a fortune in this boat. You know you can trust me. Sure, I know I can. And don't forget, take good care of this little baby there. No, no! No! Hold still. Where are the others? But I'm all alone here. Where is Laura Crawford? I don't know, she disappeared. Cut the laugh, stupid. I'm sorry, I've gotta do this to you. I can't allow you to get away. There we go. You swine. Put your hands up and chuck that rifle away. Where have you hidden the girl? Unfortunately, she was caught by the cannibals and is going to be sacrificed their god. So what have you got in mind, what do you wanna do? I oughta kill you. If I were you, I wouldn't do it. My friend's on the boat and he's got the $6 million with him. If I'm not back in an hour, he'll sail away, and you'll be left here at the mercy of the cannibals. Perhaps you're right. C'mon. Get moving, back to the beach. Hold it there. Call your friend. Jack! It's me, Peter! Jack! Tell your friend that if he doesn't reply in 30 seconds, I'll blow your head right off. C'mon, tell him. And if I don't do it? I'll blow your head off right now. Alright. Jack, if you don't answer, our friend here says he's gonna blow my head off right now. And if he does, do me a favor, return the compliment. C'mon, Weston, let's get onto the boat. No! No, no! No! No, no! No, no! - Feeling better? - Yes, thank you. And you Peter? Couldn't feel better with the company here.
