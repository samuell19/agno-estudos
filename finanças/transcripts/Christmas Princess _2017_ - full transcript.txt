[♪♪♪] [humming "O, Christmas Tree"] [♪♪♪] [car horn honking] Bye! Donaly? [door shuts] Thank you. Cheers! To the first day of senior year. Yes! Ahh! [♪♪♪] [quiet hallway chatter] [♪♪♪] Oh, my... Is that... [chuckles] "Little Trent?" Not so little anymore! Can someone grow a whole foot over summer? Apparently. Hey. Uh, hi. Who are you again? I know, my mom is mad because she had to buy me all new clothes twice this year, and somehow it's my dad's fault. [laughs] [♪♪♪] [quiet exchange] Okay. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [class bell rings] Are you gonna try out? Totally. How about you? Mm. I don't know. Not like they're gonna pick me. Well, not with that attitude. Hello, ladies. My name is Sharon, and as I'm sure you've guessed, I'm with the Tournament of Roses Committee. Now, is there a girl in Pasadena who hasn't dreamed of sitting atop the float on New Year's Day? The crowds, the excitement, the television audience? It is a special event. But that's not all there is to being on "The Royal Court." Who knows how many events a Rose Princess would be asked to attend? 10? 20? Try over a hundred. Now, you will not only be representing this year's tournament, but you would be representing all the young ladies and all the tournaments, past and present. But first... you need to be chosen. This is not a beauty contest. This is about your talents... your communication skills, your values. There will by four rounds of questions, where the judges will be assessing you on your poise, personality, your intelligence, your inner beauty, and your strength of character. You will be the ambassadors of our community, reaching out to people of all walks of life. People who look forward to, every year, meeting the next seven young women who will be part of a 98-year-old tradition of being role models and inspiring the next generation. And I promise, it is the experience of a lifetime. Now... if any of you think you have what it takes... [chuckles] ...to be a part of this wondrous tradition I look forward to meeting you next week, at Round One. Thank you. [♪♪♪] [Sharon]: Hi! I'm Sharon. Oh, no. You can actually just pay for that over there. Five, please. All proceeds go directly to the homeless outreach. Hey. I've got to get home for dinner. Okay. Hey, we're running low on fives and quarters, so we'll need some for tomorrow. Cool. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [laughing hysterically] Donaly? Are you okay? What's going on? Uh, yeah, I'm okay. You look like you've seen a ghost. No. I'm okay. Let's go. [♪♪♪] [exhales shakily] She can't get to you. She can't get to you. She can't get to you. She can't get to you. [takes a shaky breath] [Emily sighs] Why is my life so hard? What? See? No one listens to me. It's the fate of being the youngest sister. What? Do you ever think about before we got here? Why would I want to do that? You were too little. You're not gonna... are you? There was a presentation at school. You don't think I should? Well, only if you want to be disappointed. They don't pick girls like us. [♪♪♪] [Ignacio]: Okay, let's bow our heads. Bless us, oh, Lord, for these gifts that you lay at our table, and please extend your graces over each one of us. We ask this in your name. Amen. [overlapping]: Amen. So, who wants to go first, telling me about their first day of school? Abraham. Ms. Tomanski already assigned homework and it's only the first day. I think that's rude. Well, you did it, though, right? Uh, not yet. Oh. Okay. You know the rules. Hand it over. [weary sigh] No phone until you do all your homework. Thank you. My big mouth. [chuckling] All right, who's next? Donaly's got something to say. Shut up! We don't say shut up. She's gonna try out to be a Rose Princess. No. What do you mean, no? It's a simple word. I believe you're all familiar with it. Why? No father wants to see his daughter go through that. Besides... you are all already my princesses. [Abraham]: Uh! I don't want to be a princess! Especially you. Wha...? [Emily chuckling] -No! -Eat. I'm not a princess! [knocking] You okay? You know your dad's just being overprotective... about the Rose Princess tryouts. I know. It's not that. Well, then what is it? You seem... lost in thought. Do you believe in destiny? I believe we... control our decisions, which creates our destiny. What about DNA and stuff? Well, that just controls whether you're tall or short, or if you wear glasses, or if you have bad knees. But not if you're good or kind... or successful. There's a new psychologist at school. And I was wondering if I could talk with her. Why? Is something wrong? No. No. It's, um... I'm just in my senior year, and I just want to talk to her about stuff. Not bad stuff, just stuff. I understand, honey. Yeah. Yeah, it's okay. "Stuff"? Teenage stuff. Therapists are for poor people with big problems or rich people with little problems, and we're neither of those things. Besides, what's the point of adoption if you can't talk to your parents about things? Honey, I think you've forgotten what it's like to be a teenager. What does that mean? It means that most kids her age would rather have a root canal than talk to their parents about anything. [chuckles softly] Well, Donaly... Donaly, Emily, and Abraham... have gone through more than most. Yeah. [♪♪♪] [bangs door shut] [giggling deliriously] [panicking and hyperventilating] [♪♪♪] [woman on TV]: You and the Royal Court will have many wonderful and magical experiences. [♪♪♪] You know, you don't have to talk, if you don't want to. Do you want to tell me what's going on in school? I'm thinking about trying out for the Royal Court. Oh? I'm not expecting anything. Why's that? They wouldn't pick me. I'm a foster kid. But you've been with the Marquez family for a few years, and they've adopted you. Yeah, but I was a foster kid first. I was teased about that a lot when I was younger. And that sticks with you. I get that. Are you glad that you were adopted? My sister, Emily, and my younger brother, Abraham, they were really glad, they really wanted it. But not you? No, I did. I'm... grateful. They're really good people. It's... just, in my experience, it's not a good idea to get too attached. "The second shoe always drops," you know? What I know is that when we spend our lives waiting for second shoes to drop, they always do, every time. Maybe we could work on you being a little bit more open and not always waiting for something bad to happen. [school bell rings] Did Ignacio give you a green light for tryouts? Working on it. Which means no. It's a process. Well, you better hurry that process up! Tryouts are almost here. Hey, Donaly! Think fast! [laughs] Hey. Are you looking at Trent? What? No. Don't be weird. We've known him since the fourth grade. Thank you for helping me out. I've been meaning to clean out this closet for ages. Ahh! Donaly, look! It's your tree. Do you remember? When you first came to us, it was near Christmastime. You used to carry this drawing with you all the time and say it was your Christmas tree. [quiet chuckle] Roberta wouldn't let us have a real one. She said it was for "other people." Christmas is for everyone. I never understood what these things were... Roses. I was watching the Rose Parade. Everyone was so pretty and happy. They made me happy. Do you want to try out? I can talk to your dad. Seriously? Yeah, I'm... I'm still concerned. I mean, it's a lot of responsibil... Yeah! Okay... [laughing] [Abraham]: What is wrong with you, weirdo? Oh, that might be "Princess Weirdo" to you. [shrieking, laughing] Oh, thank you! [continues laughing] Is that really your final position? I have nothing to wear. What about that purple one? She'll look like an eggplant. Someone told me that you should find a dress that you can wear to every round so that they remember you, so, it should be a real good dress. Well, I don't even have a "meh" dress, so... Have you thought about what you're gonna say to the judges? No. Well, you only get 15 seconds to sum up your whole life and separate yourself from thousands of other girls, so it better be good. Great. Like I wasn't feeling any pressure before now. Thanks, Chloe. You're welcome. For? Oh! But that's your Madrid dress. I know. Lucky for you, we're the same size, 'cause you're such a shrimp. You'd let me wear your Madrid dress? Well, not just for anything! Are you getting emotional? What? No. Ugh! Emotions. [laughs] [♪♪♪] We have a winner! Hey, wait! You haven't done your makeup yet. Oh, that's fine. Chloe's saving me a spot in line. Are you super-nervous? Uh... yeah. You'll be fine. You're wearing my lucky dress. Hey. Remember what Mom always says. Right? Trust in God. Through whom all things are possible. Exactly. Got it. Go get ready! Okay! [both laughing] [buzzing chatter] [♪♪♪] Hi. I'm Donaly, and I just started my senior year. Hi. My name's Donaly and I'm a senior. Hi there! Oh. Anything but the... [♪♪♪] At least we'll be done early. I'm so nervous. Do you know what you're gonna say? I have no clue what I'm gonna say. My mind's blank. Like, I may forget my own name. "Monique Groves." Thank goodness, I told you! This is my best friend, Donaly. Hi, Donaly. -Hey. -Monique is from Missouri. Yeah, well, that was before I moved out here a couple years ago, to live with my aunt. I should not have eaten those blueberry pancakes. Did you guys eat? Uh, we're gonna grab a bite after this. Wise. I wish I'd done that. I hope I don't throw up. 15 seconds! What can you possibly say in 15 seconds that will leave a lasting impression? Apart from throwing up. Don't do that. I know! Bad impression. It just means so much, you know? Aren't you from Missouri? Well, originally, but my mom's from Pasadena and she used to tell us about how she tried out for the Royal Court and made it all the way to the finals, but didn't get picked, but still loved watching the parade and she'd make sure we all watched it together every year before she... Oh. And, well, you want to do this for her. Yeah. Well, I think you should just say that to the judges. Just like that. Yeah. You're right. Speak from the heart. Yeah. And don't throw up. [laughs] ...And it was always important to her that we watch together, so... I'm doing this in her memory. Time's up, number 21. Thank you very much for coming. Thank you. Good luck. [♪♪♪] Most kids look forward to the holidays because they get lots of presents, but before I was put in a foster home, and before I was adopted, I never got any, and my mother was barely around. But what I did look forward to during the holidays was watching The Rose Parade and seeing The Royal Court Princesses on their float. That made me really happy and hopeful in a time that I really needed to be. Why I really want to do this is because I know there are kids out there watching like I was, and I want to reach out to them and make them happy and hopeful, too. Time's up, number 22. Thank you so much for coming. Thank you. [♪♪♪] Hey, Donaly. Wait up. Hey. How'd it go? I'm not sure, but it's done. I'm sure you did great. So, the Event Committee's meeting tonight. Right. Are you going? You were so good at it last year. The Christmas Dance totally rocked. I think I'm still getting red glitter out of my hair. Rejected! [mimics being shot] Single tear. I'm sorry, Chloe. For what? The Rose Princess, duh. Did you hear back yet? Not yet. They've bn sending e-mails all day. Well, I guess it wasn't meant to be. They'd be lucky to have you. [chuckles] [♪♪♪] [phone alert chimes] I have to go. [♪♪♪] Ingrid Caseras's cousin got her email an hour ago. She's in the next round. [Donaly]: Okay. I told her you would be, too, so don't make me a liar. My lucky dress must go on. [laughs] [phone alert chimes] Is it them? Open it! [♪♪♪] Well? I'm having trouble reading it. I don't know. What does it say? [gasps and squeals] [all laughing] I am so proud of you! Take that, Ingrid Caseras! My sister, Donaly Marquez, is going into Round Two of the Rose Princess Tryouts! Whoo! [♪♪♪] Hey. Hey. You said it was only one round. Well, there was over a thousand girls there. Yeah, but Donaly's different. We're not gonna stop her now. And I wouldn't want to. She'd be heartbroken. And it's our responsibility to support our children's goals. But the farther this thing goes, the harder it's gonna get. For all of us. When the time comes, we'll be there to comfort her. Oh... You don't think she's gonna make it. That's just it. I think she is. And then what happens? Things will change. Things always change. [♪♪♪] That's awesome! Congrats! I mean, there's still, like, more than 200 other girls. Well, whatever. You'll totally toast them. How's your dad dealing? Uh, my mom is smoothing it over. Mm, well, that's what moms are for. Oh, I'm such a jerk. I didn't even... Uh, no, no, no. Don't. Don't even. Just be proud and happy that you're moving on. Are you sure? Yeah. I mean, it would've been cool, I guess, but I probably would've had to give up my job, and I can't really afford that, and... plus, it's not really me. Well, it's not really me, either. It totally is! You're, like, sweetness and cheerful. Well, I wish you were coming with me. I'll be there in spirit. Come on. [♪♪♪] Welcome, number 22. There will be one minute of questions, beginning with... If we were to look in on your social media, what would we find? What's your favorite movie? Who's your favorite singer? What's your favorite flower? And describe yourself in one word. Pictures of food, mostly pizza, because I love pizza. And I've always wanted to try shrimp fettuccine. The Blind Side. Beyonce. Always Beyonce. Roses, naturally. And... "independent." Why independent? My birth mother taught me that, to only rely on myself, no matter what. But what about others? Friends? Your family? Can't you count on them? [timer beeps] Time's up, number 22. Thank you so much for coming. Thank you. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Look, Mama. For Santa. [turns faucet on] [exhaling deeply] Don't expect them to get full anytime soon. I don't. Sure you do. [dry chuckle] You think Mama gonna give you everything. Well... life don't work like that. Best you learn that lesson now. Life don't give you anything, even if it's Christmas. What'd I say? Life don't give you anything. Even...? Even if it's Christmas. [♪♪♪] Hey, Princess. Don't jinx me. Nah. You're jinx-proof. Well, now I'm really jinxed. Impossible. Thank you. What's the deal with you and Trent? Nothing. No deal. We are deal-free. But you guys like each other, right? What? No. He's... He's our friend. Who's suddenly kind of hot. [♪♪♪] Others have noticed, too. Boyfriends are overrated. Right. [♪♪♪] [bottles rattling on fridge door] [♪♪♪] [text alert chimes] [laughs] [laughing] [♪♪♪] Are you mad at me? I'm not mad at you. I'm trying to protect you. It's what dads do. It's not like I'm going to win. Why not? Someone's got to win. I thought you didn't want me to win. No. I want you to be happy. And safe. Mostly safe. Hand me the ratchet, please. Really? [laughs] Didn't I teach you anything? Ah-hah! There we go. Some kind of princess. -I knew that. -Did you? Yeah, I was just testing you. -You sure? -Yeah. Click-wrench is what that is. [laughs] [♪♪♪] I mean, I'm the last one from our school to be in the running. And that's good... right? Yeah. Yeah. You know, Donaly, I gotta tell you, I find it very odd that you're doing well in school, you've got a good family, you've got good friends, and now you're in the third round of this amazing competition, and yet you're focusing on the negative. Why is that? I'm just feeling a lot of pressure, you know? Like, what if I can't do this? But you are doing it. I mean, this, right here, thisis "doing it". And all those other girls who were princesses before you, they felt exactly what you're feeling. Does this have anything to do with your past? Or with your biological mother? What do you mean? Well, we never talk about her, so I'm curious, if what you're feeling is... It doesn't. Okay. Are you in contact with her? No, and I don't want to talk about her. Okay. That's okay. Maybe another time. But, listen. Whether it's the Royal Court or whatever else, it doesn't matter where you came from. You can do anything that put your mind to. But, Donaly... sometimes, you are gonna have to fight for it. [♪♪♪] Hey. Did you just come out of that counselor's office? Uh, yeah. She just was curious about the Royal Court. Like everyone. You know you can tell me anything, right? We've been friends since the second grade. You already know everything. Just in the BFF job description. [chuckling] Are you ready for next round? Uh, yeah. I gotta run. See ya. [awkwardly]: Bye. [♪♪♪] And I'm no different. I guess was afraid at first. Not of standing here talking to you, but that my past as a foster child would keep you from seeing the real me, or that maybe you would see the real me, and what that means. [♪♪♪] Times up, number 22. Thank you so much for coming. Thank you. [♪♪♪] [quiet murmuring] [hyperventilating] [♪♪♪] [text alert chimes] [quiet gasp] [doorbell chimes] Mr. Jordan gave us a folder for suggestions for the Christmas dance. -Here. -Thanks. I'm making some tea. Do you want some? Yeah. What's goin' on, D? Seems like everyone wants to know what's going on with me. Yeah, you're right. I hate it when people care about me. So annoying. I made it to the Finals. That's great! So why am I the only one celebrating? Because I'm not a princess yet. Yeah, but, you're, like, close. I'm really close. Just don't tell anyone, okay? Don't? I don't get it. It's kind of hard to explain what happened before. Maybe you'll tell me someday. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [crowd applauding] Welcome. [cell phone rings] We just got our seats. Can you see the stage? Perfect view. Welcome to the beautiful Tournament House for this year's official selection of the Tournament of Roses Royal Court. [applauding] What's going on? [hushed]: The tournament lady is talking. And for the seven names I will read, their lives are about to change forever as they are initiated into a sisterhood like no other. So... without further ado, let's get started. When I call your name and number, please step forward and form a line. For the audience, this will be the order in which they will stand from here on out. We call this "Court Order." [laughter] Now... for our first selection... Number 178. They called a number higher than hers. Do they call in order? I can't tell. Number 21, Monique Groves. [applause and cheering] [♪♪♪] And finally... Number 22, Donaly Marquez. [applauding and cheering] She did it! She won! She's a princess. [chuckling] [♪♪♪] Ladies and gentlemen, it is with my great pleasure that I give to you the Tournament of Roses' Royal Court. [crowd applauding] [♪♪♪] [crowd applauding] [♪♪♪] Oh! Thank you. [♪♪♪] [shutter snapping] This feels like a dream. Yeah. I just wish my Mom was here to see it. She's looking down on you right now. Ladies, can I have your attention? Well... You are now part of an elite group of women that dates back to 1890, and no matter where you go in life, you will always be a "Princess." And nothing, and no one, can ever take that from you, so congratulations again. You are about to embark on a journey that is going to take your life in directions that are big and small... in ways you may not even realize yet, until further down the line, when you've had time take a breath, and reflect on just how far you've come... Thank you. ...And how big the changes really have been... "Princess Donaly's mother." ...But I promise you... the best is yet to come. You did it. I'm so glad you're here. I am so proud of you. My friends think you're cool. Yes! [♪♪♪] Thank you. Thank you. Don't forget, you have to make your Facebook account private. Already done. And your Twitter account... And my Snapchat and my Instagram. -Right. -But why? The Committee recommends it. "Strongly" recommends it. Because she's so famous! Well, she's about to be, and we have to be careful. You know, anyone can find you now. [♪♪♪] Aww... [kisses her] I knew you would win. But don't forget... you were our princess first. Hi. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [both chuckling] [phone vibrating] Hey! This is Donaly. Please leave a message. [beep] [♪♪♪] Hello, Donaly. Mom. It was you. I thought I saw you a while back. But you didn't bother to find out for sure? I did. You have a minute? To talk? I should stick with the group. They're pretty strict on rules. Just a minute... for me. I'll ask. I... um... Are you okay? Does it involve... that woman? [takes a shaky breath] She's my... birth mother. Oh. Yeah, I haven't seen her in a really long time. Do you want to see her now? I should talk to her. I'll wait here for you, and if you need anything, you just wave. Okay? Thanks. So... You're a princess now. You've come a long way. How are you doing? Well, I'm not a princess... I'm doing okay. How's Abraham and Emily? Good. Good? Taller. Especially Abraham. His daddy was tall. Emily went to Madrid over the summer. Where? Spain. She saved up her babysitting money, and she walked almost all the dogs in the neighborhood. She saved up, like, $1,000, and Mom and Dad said... What'd they say? They said that, if she saved up that much, they'd pay for the rest of the trip. Must be nice. Mom and Dad say it's important to see the world, and "Find Your Adventure" is the theme of this year's Rose Parade, so... that's what I want to do, see everything. Looks like all my kids are living the fine life. That's the goal, isn't it? I suppose. As long as you don't forget. Forget? Where you come from... And you come from me. That was a long time ago. From where I stand, it feels like yesterday. I remember everything. Do you? Yeah, I was in a bad spot then, but... I'm doing okay now. I'm doing just fine. You always did think you were better than me, even when you were little. Acting like a mommy. Someone had to! [scoffs] You haven't changed. I thought you might, but... I know. I know who you are. You're my daughter. My flesh, my blood. You come from me, so don't go thinking you're better, Princess. You can wear those fancy dresses... Is that what you came here to tell me? Maybe! Maybe I just wanted to get a look at you, and you get a look at me. Be a reminder you can't get cozy in that little world, hear me? Everything looks all good, and your family's good to you, paying for trips, buying you clothes... making you feel safe. But that's when the other shoe drops. And it always does. And then what? I gotta go. [choking up]: Donaly, wait. This isn't how I wanted it to... I didn't mean... [♪♪♪] [sobs] [♪♪♪] [Abraham crying] [♪♪♪] I have last block free and so does Claire, so we can meet at the study hall then, and we can just go over the practice exams. Chloe! Hey, I need to talk to you. Can't. We're talking about the upcoming test for, you know, school. Oh. He always puts the questions on the practice test on the real test, so I think if we nail it, right, we'll be fine. It'll be good. Don't act like that. You're never around anymore. That's not my fault. Never said it was, but the rest of us have lives, too. Chloe. What, Donaly? I need to talk to my best friend. [♪♪♪] Come on. Wow... Your birth mom. How do you feel about it? Kind of numb. She didn't feel like my mom. She felt like... who she always was, not like my real mom. You haven't told your parents? Not yet. Donaly! I didn't know what to say. I mean, they've been afraid something like this would happen. Thanks for listening. I'm sorry I've been such a bad friend lately. You have a lot going on. Like, way more than me. That's not true. It is, and it's fine. I mean, we've been friends since I found you blubbering at recess in second grade. And we always will be. I was not blubbering! You totally were. Stacey Hicks cut my hair! Whatever! It grew back. I miss you. Miss you, too. Now give me all the details! How many girls can say their best friend is a princess? [knocking] Come in. I need to tell you something. Okay. [sniffling] See? This is why I was worried about that princess stuff. Why didn't you tell us sooner? I don't know. I guess I was trying to sort it out. You're supposed to sort it out with us, your family. Is she gonna contact you again? No, she said she wouldn't. But you didn't know she was going to contact you in the first place. What makes you trust that she's not gonna do it again? Because I know her, she's my mother! [♪♪♪] She's your mother. She's the one who's taken care of you. Your whole life! When you were sick or you were sad, when you got to go to school, or this thing or the other thing, or you're gonna try something new. She's happy when you're happy. I didn't mean it like that. I just... I appreciate everything you guys have done for me. Well, I wonder sometimes. You're our daughter, Donaly. You're part of this family, just like everyone else. I really hope you believe that one day. [♪♪♪] [exhales] That's intense. Yeah. Well, at the risk of sounding like a therapist, how did it make you feel to see her again? Well, once I got over the shock... freaked. I mean... she was basically like she was before. Older, yeah, and I think she got clean, but... She still felt the same. And that scared me a little. Scared you? Why? Well, it's hard to explain. I mean, she just gets in my head, you know? How? Well, everyone keeps saying that I'm, like, cheerful and bubbly all the time, but I'm not. Well, nobody can be all the time. I mean, that would be exhausting. [laughs] What if I wind up like her? I mean, she kept saying how I "came from her." What if she's right? Donaly, your biological mother is where she is in life because of the choices that she made, and, it sounds like is continuing to make. You're not her. You are not making those same choices. Yet. Just because you share DNA with a person does not mean you'll make the same choices as them. Come to Thanksgiving dinner with my family... trust me, you'll see that I'm right. You're going through a lot of changes right now, Donaly. You're almost 18, it's your senior year, and now you're a Rose Princess. I mean, it's pretty natural that these issues and these fears are gonna come up for you. But I know that you're going to find a way to let that go. You're the architect of your own future, nobody else. You get to decide if it's made of joy or not. [♪♪♪] Heavenly Father, we thank You for the many blessings You give us each and every day, for this food, for keeping our circle of faith strong. And we hope to know how much each of us means to each other... now and always. We remain ever thankful, in Jesus' name. Amen. [others]: Amen. And I just want to take a moment to let everyone know how thankful I am for each of you, my family, and the love we share, since the moment you came into our lives and made our lives complete. I'm so grateful. [♪♪♪] Don't say I never got you anything for Christmas. [chuckles] I'll go get Emily and Abraham. What does it feel like to be so rich? [laughs] We're not rich, honey. Does Santa come here? Well, of course! Why do you ask? He never came before. You don't have to worry about that anymore. He's always going to find you here. [♪♪♪] [Ignacio]: All right, let's eat. -Here you go. -Here, give me your plate. [♪♪♪] [brakes screech] [bustling chatter] Thank you. Sharon? I looked at the schedule and saw that we added Hillside Home for the Girls in a couple weeks. That's right. Now I hope that's not going to be too hard for you. No. No, it's fine. Really. I... I hear it's nice there. I just wanted to say that I'm really glad we're going. Good. [cell phone ringing] Hola. What? Which hospital? Yeah, no. I'm coming right now! Yeah. [background buzz and chatter] All right, just a second. Honey, you have a phone call. Hello? I got to go. My mom is in the hospital. Come on. [♪♪♪] Where are you going? There's a vending machine at the end of the hall. I'm not being disrespectful. I'm just hungry. Don't eat junk. I won't. I don't believe you. Here. Gimme. I'm going to get you the good option. Flaming-hot Cheetos? Granola bar or nuts. [♪♪♪] [Ignacio]: It's going to be okay. [Doctor]: But the ligaments in your ankle are badly torn. This compromises the blood flow to the rest of your foot. The nerve damage is extensive. [Ignacio]: So what are you saying? This is going to be a long process. How soon before I can go back to work? Well, not for a very long time. Your convalescence must take priority over everything else. But... it's Christmas. And you're lucky to be celebrating it. [♪♪♪] [Sara]: Now what do we do? What'd you get me? Nothing. It was broken. [♪♪♪] What are those? Christmas shopping your mom was doing. [♪♪♪] [phone vibrates] Hello? Oh, Donaly. Of course, we understand. Yeah, if you need anything, you just let us know. All right? Okay, darling. Bye-bye. [♪♪♪] [phone chimes] [sighing] [phone vibrates] [door opens downstairs] [Ignacio]: Yeah, we'll figure it out. If she can't work, it's gonna hurt. I know. Well, no, that's... I don't know what to do about the kids. Yeah. Well, listen, I got to get changed, and head back to the hospital. Okay. [♪♪♪] [heavy sigh] [♪♪♪] What are you doing? Things are changing and we need to be ready. I'm always gonna be here, though. [♪♪♪] [quiet conversations, indistinct] Hey. Have you talked to Donaly? I've tried, but she's not answering my texts or calls. Yeah... I think she's gone into her whole protective "Ninja Turtle" mode. She does that when she's scared. I'm gonna make her talk. And I know who to bring for back-up. [♪♪♪] Hey! No! What do you mean, no? You can't be having this much sugar right before bed. Stop acting like my mom! Who do you think took care of you when you were little? I'm not little anymore, and I have a mom. Who's in the hospital. Look. We need to take care of each other, okay? Ugh! [knocking at door] [surprised chuckle] Coffee or hot chocolate? Hot chocolate. [♪♪♪] I can't believe you both came. Chloe called, so I came. I knew I'd need reinforcements so you wouldn't be too gloomy. I'm not gloomy. Yes, you are, right beneath that perpetually-perky thing you've got going. Now, let's get real. How is she? She'll be home in a few days, and then, after that, a lot of time to recover. I know how scary this all is. I know your life got upended. I think mine is about to be, too. What do you mean? This reminds me of when I got taken from my birth mom and put into foster care. Roberta was right. What are you talking about? The other shoe... it dropped. [♪♪♪] Oh... Thank you, honey. Come here. How are your Royal Court events going? They're fine. How are you doing? I'm okay. I'm sorry we can't drive around and see the lights this year. Maybe next year we will. Sure. Do you know where I keep the presents, the ones I bought? Dad put them in the front closet. Well, maybe you can bring them to me later, so I can wrap them. I can wrap them for you, Mom. No, I can wrap the presents. It was my foot, not my hands. [♪♪♪] Hey. Hey. So I got your text. Thank you for checking in with me. I really appreciate it. Are you okay? I don't know. Do you... Do you want to talk? Donaly, you're not a foster kid anymore. You're adopted. Adopted kids get sent back. Especially after something like this happens. Come on, Donaly. Trent, you grew up in the perfect two-parent, both-doctors house. I didn't. I've seen this happen before. I've... I've lived with this before. Tell me about it. Growing up, my bio mom was... the polite word is "troubled." And we were taken away. [Abraham crying] [continues crying] [hushed exchange] Eventually, we got lucky and we were placed with a really nice foster family, and that was the first time I ever had my own bed. But we couldn't stay... the mother got sick, and we had to go. And you think that's gonna happen again now? I always expected it, even after Sara and Ignacio adopted us, but... well, here it is. I mean, they're good people, and I know that... But we're in the way now. D, you need to talk to your parents, ask them. One way or the other, you'll know. No more guessing. And if you are staying... I'd really like to take you to the Christmas Dance. As a date. [chuckles] [♪♪♪] I figured I'd wrap them for her. I've been keeping track of which is which, so she can tell me who gets what. Hmm. This one I figured out on my own. It's a safe bet. Yeah. It's okay, you know. We're packed and ready. And me, Emily, and Abraham, we all really appreciate everything you've done for us, and we're never gonna forget it. But I understand. It's gonna take her a long time to recover, and bills are gonna pile up, and who knows how long she won't be able to work for. It'll be so much easier without us. It won't be easier with you... because we'd be heartbroken without you. [sniffles] Donaly... [sighs heavily] Oh, you're a lot like me. Stubborn... ...And always want to take care of those you love. I thought I could keep everyone safe by controlling things. I kept them so that if I saw something awful coming, I could get in front of it. But life doesn't work like that. I was worried something bad was gonna happen to you if you became a Rose Princess, so I didn't want you to do it. But think of all these good things you would've missed out on. And then that happens to your mamma while she's... shopping. Shopping! [laughing] How am I gonna protect anyone from shopping? [laughs] That's life. And we can't guard ourselves from life. So, you want to take care. I want to take care. But, what I think is... maybe instead worrying about what we shoulddo, we should just trust that we can all get through anything, together. And let God take care of us. Keep our hearts open. [♪♪♪] You're not going anywhere, Donaly. That's not how families work. You... deserve a family. Don't let anyone ever take that away from you. Anyone. Okay? [tearfully]: Okay. Okay. [sniffs] That's the most you've ever said. Ever. Yeah. I probably won't talk that much again. [laughing] So what's next? This! [laughs] Ah. Please tell me that's for Abraham. No, it's yours. No returns. Hey! Thank you very much. Can I have the football? No! [cracking up] [♪♪♪] [quiet chatter] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Hi. Merry Christmas. I'm Princess Donaly, and... I just wanted you all to know that... I came from a place just like this, a group home. And it might be hard to believe, but... I'm just like you. I'm exactly like you. And... well, it might not seem like it right now, but I promise you that things will get better. I didn't believe that either. I used to think that where I came from would determine where I was going, and... that scared me. A lot. Before all of this, you might think that I was chill and didn't have a care in the world, but, deep down... there was a lot of doubt. It took the Royal Court Tryouts... ...to bring up the fears that I had been ignoring, and that is a really good thing, because I had to face them to beat them. And it also made me realize that... I can count on my family and my loved ones, and my friends, who have become my family... [laughs] ...to love and to support me. I deserve that family. You all deserve that family. What I really wanted to tell you guys is that you can do anything you want to do... As long as you set your mind to it. You can decide who you want to be and what you want to become. You just gotta have some faith and some trust and a lot of love. [laughs] Thank you and Merry Christmas. [applauding] [♪♪♪] [Emily whispering]: You get this one! [shushing] They're coming, they're coming. [laughing] [Sara]: Ignacio, what are you doing? [chuckles] Where are you taking me? You'll see. [Sara gasps] Wow! [still gasping] [laughter] We figured that, since you couldn't go see the lights... We'd bring the lights to you. It was Donaly's idea. Thank you, honey! -I helped! -Me, too. Yes. Hey... your dad told me about your talk. I don't ever want you to be afraid again, not even for a second, you understand? You are my beautiful daughter... myprincess. Now and forever. I know. You guys are my family... and even if I wasn't born from you, I was born from your hearts. That's right. Hey. Open one present. It's Christmas Eve. Come on. Tah-dah! Uh, I didn't wrap this one. [laughs] [♪♪♪] [quiet chuckle] [♪♪♪] It really is. It really is. [Sara]: Come on, kids! You each get to open one present. It's Christmas Eve. Christmas cookies, anybody? That's cool. Ladies first. Uh... And the boys will eat the rest. Too slow. [♪♪♪]
