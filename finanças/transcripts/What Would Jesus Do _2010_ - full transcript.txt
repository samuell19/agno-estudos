Come on people... Let's go... It's time for the Maxwell family vacation. Hey Dad, you almost forgot my fishing pole. We wouldn't want to forget that, would we? No way. Some trout swimming around there have my name. Ok, thank you. Get inside. Come on honey. Train is leaving. Well I guess here comes the caboose. You look great, sweetie. You are just saying that. I look like a whale. A beautiful whale. Henry, what happened? I just remembered something. Now what? I think I forgot to tell Mrs Anderson to order more bibles for the Sunday School. Henry, I know you're the pastor, but you can't do everything. This is our vacation. They'll take care of it. You're right, honey. Let's enjoy our getaway. How much farther to the lake, dad? We've been driving for an hour, son. It takes five to get there. So we have four hours left, right mum? Very good Jake'o. Want a sandwich? Sure, Mum. Mum... turkey? You know I wanted peanut butter and jelly. That's all we had honey. Be thankful, there are a lot of children who have nothing. Ya. Ya... Is he asleep? He's out cold. I thought we'd be there by now. It's not much farther. Good, because these mountain roads scare me. Have faith, we'll be alright. Henry. How is our patient doing, doctor? His pressure is still little high, so I'm keeping him in an induced coma while we monitor head swelling. - Can he hear us? - No. So his wife and little boy both died in the crash? Yes. They were both pronounced at the scene. City Rescue noticed the wife was pregnant and rushed her in. When they arrived there were faint vitals on the foetus. How is the newborn? She was just too premature. We did everything we could. "She"? He should had a daughter... I appreciate the ride, brother. Are you sure you want to stop here? Look around. There is nothing here man. This place looks dead. Thanks, but this is as good a place as any. Remember what we talked about. I will. - Would you take some money? - No. - Take the money, it's not much. - No. I'll be fine. I'm a hard worker. We have more evictions this week. That's terrible news. I'm sorry to hear that. It's really starting to cut into my bottom line. All I can say is once I'm Mayor, your vacancy rate will be zero. We're really going to make a difference around here. Pretty soon the only thing I'll have left is the restaurant. Don't worry my friend, our plans and our agenda is out there and it's winning converts everyday. First Peter chapter two, verse twenty-one goes on to say, "Because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps." Henry. Therefore, atonement from the side of example. Jesus shows how faith in Christ helped to save men because of the pattern or character he displayed for their imitation. Dad, careful. So what is Jesus telling us? Is there anyone who can answer that? Anyone? - Is that all, pastor? - Yes. Your weekly obligation to God is fulfilled. That's it folks. Ladies and gentlemen, as your Mayor I will bring back your jobs, homes, and the prosperity you once enjoyed. I promise to open businesses and create jobs. If you leave here with nothing else today, leave here remembering the word "opportunity". Opportunity for a new life. If you put your trust in me, I will not let you down. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate. Thank you. Thanks, it good to see you. Excuse me sir, where I can find a place to sleep? There used to be one at the old church, down the street on the left hand side. Thanks. Come in. Can I help you? I don't do unscheduled appointments. I'm not here for an appointment. I just need a few minutes of your time. Come on in. I only have a minute though. Sure. I was told there is a shelter here. No, we don't do the shelter any more. How about some work, maybe in exchange for a place to sleep for the night? Sorry, we don't do those types of things here any more either. I'm an honest man, looking for an honest day pay. Can you help me? I'm sorry, I can't help you. I wish I could but, I can't. Are you alright, pastor? You don't look so good. Things are really tough in this town right now. People just aren't coming to church. Isn't it when people need the Lord most, at tough times? That's true. But, try to explain that to them. Isn't that your role as minister? Yes. Look, I have a lot of things to do. I wish you luck. I hope you find work and... I'm sorry. "Be shepherds of God's flock that is under your care, "serving as overseers-not because you must, but "because you're willing as God wants you to be." - First Peter, Chapter Five? - Yes. Who are you? Just a lamb. Virginia, Mildred, I hope you're both doing well. I'm fine thank you, James. You're looking particularly lovely today. You said you have something important to tell me. You're right, let's quit the small talk. Small talk is a waste of time and money. Well look who's here. This is my partner, soon to be Mayor, Alex York. It's nice to finally meet you ladies. Of course, Mr York, how do you do? Mrs Paige, Virginia. Let's not mince words. The city of Raymond is dying. The crime rate is skyrocketing. Jobs are evaporating. It's getting drastic. We are very familiar. Our rental income has been cut in half. I have a plan to turn things around. What do you propose? To open up a hotel/casino. It will open up hundreds of new jobs and bring money flooding into the city. Those jobs will be filled by people from town. Then we can get your rental income back up. The rent should be even higher. But gambling is illegal in this city. Not for much longer. And where do you plan on building the casino? Do you have the land? The 1st Church of Raymond sits on the perfect location. It has freeway access, high visibility, and lots of parking. You're going to buy the church? How? It's up for sale. The church has been an institution here since the town was founded, a hundred years ago. That institution is dying from lack of interest and funds. - You yourself hardly go. - How do you... What I'm suggesting is that we move the church's location. We'll build it in a family friendly spot, it will be bigger and better. Mildred, there is a motion that will be presented to the Raymond City Council making gambling legal. With York as mayor, we know it will pass. But, why not wait until after the election to buy the land? Things are really bad at the church right now and we can get it for pennies on the dollar. How much do you need? The mortgage is five hundred thousand. They're in foreclosure as we speak. What's in it for you? I just want this town to be an example. An inspiration to others. I want fifty percent of the returns after you recoup. So we take all the risk and you get half? We already have everything in place. Think about it. I know you'll make the right decision. Ladies, thank you for your time. I'll show myself out. I have a feeling I'll be back sooner rather than later. I'll be in my office. - Hello. - Hi. Can I help you? Hi, I'm looking for the owner. Virginia? Can I help you? Hello. Are you the owner? Yes. Hum... I'm new in town, and I'm looking for a little extra work. I can fix anything. I'm really good with my hands. What are you doing here? I told you Ma'am, I'm looking for work. This is a real estate office. I don't have anything for you to do here. I'm an honest GUY. I just need a little work. You gotta a big company here, you must have some odd jobs I could help out with. Honest or not, you have to leave or I'll call the police. Police? I'm not committing any crime. Please leave. Now. We have a lot of sandwiches left over from our meeting yesterday, maybe we should give them to the man. Feeding a man like that is like feeding a stray dog. Give them one little thing and you will never get rid of them. - But he just needs some food. - But nothing. Throw that stuff in the garbage. ♪ I saw a man handing a man a twenty on a corner ♪ ♪ When I heard him only ask for one ♪ ♪ Said do you really think it makes a difference? ♪ ♪ Tell me, why did you give him that much? ♪ ♪ He said I'm just doing what I can do today ♪ ♪ Cause I might be in those shoes some day ♪ ♪ Looks like his chips are down ♪ ♪ And I'm just trying to help a brother out ♪ Can I help you? I'm just enjoying the music. I'm sorry, but you gotta buy something to sit here. I'm not bothering anybody and the table was empty. Please. What's the problem? This guy is refusing to leave. I'm not refusing anything. Look buddy, you gotta buy something or hit the bricks. Do you think I can work for something to eat, I can wash dishes, anything, I don't care. I ain't hiring and I need this table for paying customers. Come on. Let's go. ♪ He said I'm just doing what I can do today ♪ Right here, gentlemen. That was a long drive. Don't worry, He's gonna be worth it. Hi. Can I get you guys something? - Coffee. - Coffee? I'll have a coffee also... Is there a sign saying "fresh home made apple pie" in the window? Yup, best in town. Well if it's the best in town, then give me a slice. Coming right up. So this is the kid from the demo tape? Yeah, he's good, isn't he? Yeah, he sounds real good. You fellas don't look like you're from around here. We're record producers up from LA. We came here to see Max. Do you record Christian music? Hardly. Stick around folks, I'll be right back. Hey, Max. Thanks for coming guys, what did you think of my set? I like your sound, Max. Sit down. I think it will be even better when we get you playing more main stream stuff. I sing in church and I've always loved playing Christian songs. Listen, Max, You ain't going to pay the bills playing gospel man... Church? That's nice. I assume you're interested in doing this full-time, right? I've dreamt about it all my life. And that's why we're here. But you will have to make some changes to your music. What kind of changes? Changes to the style of music you play. We feel our songs will suit you better... commercially. I'm ready to do whatever it takes. That's what I wanted to hear. That's good. I think we can do a lot with you. Does that mean I'm gonna get a record deal from you guys? Exactly. Thank you. Now get back up there and rock this crowd. Good luck. I did it. We did it. What did we do? They're going to give me a recording contract. They're going to pay you? - Yes. - They are? Yes. This is the real deal. I am getting a ten thousand dollar advance. We're going to be rich. I knew it; sooner or later my boy would get discovered... - What's this? - Just got it this morning. First thing I'm going to do is tell Mr Clayton to take his rent money and shove it. Max. Mum, this is it. No more evictions, or food stamps, we're gonna be kings of the world. Thank the Lord. I was worrying we were going to end up living on the street. Never. No way. Not us. And you get to sing those beautiful songs you wrote. Well... not really. They're giving me their own songs to sing. Their own songs? They said it's main stream. You should open your mail more often. Look at this room. Here. No Milk? You've been out of milk for the last twelve months. Oh. Right. Dorothy McCall's daughter called. Her Mother is still in intensive care, waiting and hoping you visit and pray with her. Oh, the Swanson's called, said they held off on the funeral as long as possible and decided to have the service without you. What else did they say? They said they were disappointed, and wondered what kind of minister you are? I wish I knew. It's another letter from the bank. They've foreclosed on the Church. We have ten days to get out. Ten days? They've sold the property. To who? It looks like York and some other investors. You have to stop blaming yourself. I don't want to talk about it. It's Sunday, don't forget to shave. I don't care... I want to be the first one out. What are you smiling about? Look at what I got a hold of. Don't get my hopes up unless you've got the goods. Even the National Tabloids can't get the photos I have. Where did you get these from? They aren't stolen are they? Let's just say a friend of a friend took pictures of the pictures. Eat your heart out Richmond Times. How's that article on the new candidate, Alex York coming along? It's going to run tomorrow. And after it comes out, everyone is going to be excited about the gaming industry coming to Raymond. - Miss Norman? - Yes. I was hoping to see you. I read in the paper you are hiring part time workers. Do you have newspaper experience? No, but, I promise I'll do a great job. Sorry, we don't hire inexperienced people here. What I lack in experience I will make up for with hard work. I don't hire strangers, never have never will... I'm just looking for an opportunity to prove myself. Eat brother. I know you're hungry. This town is starving, but it's not food these people need. What do they need then? The Bible says, like newborn babies, one must crave pure spiritual milk so that they can experience the full glory of salvation. The Bible? What these people need is money, jobs and a financial future. The Lord wants us not to be greedy for money, but eager to serve. How does serving the Lord pay the bills or help build financial security? No offence, but look at you. Is it not more important to secure one's position at His side in the place He has prepared for us? Your name is Burns? How do you know my name? I need to talk with you. Follow me. Betty, I'll be back in a minute. I heard you got arrested for robbery and assault. So I need money and got some anger issues. What's it to you? I need a man that can get things done. A man like you. What kind of things? Things that need fixing. Things that pay fifty bucks. Let's see the money I'll give you twenty now, and fifty more when you complete the job. That's more money. Okay. My problem is the new bum in town. Yeah, I've seen him around. I'll make him take a walk. You know where to find me to get the rest. Would he throw up his hands and just walk away? Hey, you were playing at the cafe, right? Yeah. Were you there? Only part of it. Are you writing a new song? Just playing with some ideas. Do you mind if I show you something? Ok. Like this. I liked this passage. Thank you. What is it again? It would be nice in my new song. Really? - Do you mind if I use it? - No. I'd be honoured. Is it one of the songs you were playing? Yeah. - It was beautiful. - Thank you. - Keep it up, never stop. - I won't. Let's try to do your songs with my chords. - It's not finished but... - Let's finish it. Would He walk among the sinners, fall to His knees? Heal the sick, save lost souls the way He used to? Would he throw up his hands and just walk away? Cry a tear for a world that's gone astray. I'm not sure, but God, I wish I knew, what would Jesus do? I love it, man. Would he throw up his hands and just walk away? I'm not sure, but God, I wish I knew, what would Jesus do? Get over there. You've become a problem. It's time for you to leave. I'm not ready to go yet. Well it's my job to make you ready. I feel your pain, brother. What did you say? You feel my pain? You don't know me. I've been where you are. What? Who are you? I'm someone who's no threat to you. Someone who understands. What do you mean? I've walked where you walk. We've no less days, to sing God's praise, Then when we'd first begun. We've no less days, to sing God's praise, Then when we'd first begun. Thank you, Max. This is Max's last Sunday with us. He will be moving on with his singing career and we wish him the best. I had a whole sermon prepared for today. But, sometimes, it's better to come right out with it than beat around the bush. Ladies and gentlemen, while I am grateful to see you here today, I bring you sad news. The bank has sold our church to a group of investors. I am sad to say they are closing us down in a few days. This will be my last sermon. It is my understanding that this church is to be demolished and a new one will be built at a new location. As you all know, my personal loss has taken a toll on my duties as your Minister. When the new church is built, I will not be coming back as your pastor. Let us bow our heads in prayer. Our Heavenly Father we ask that you help us understand... I've been wondering. If I die in the next few days which is likely to happen, I would like the satisfaction of thinking that I said my say in a place like this. I don't know of any teaching of Jesus that makes one kind of a man less worthy of saving than another. Do any of you? I've been in town for a few days trying to find a job and I've not heard a single word of comfort or sympathy. Except from your minister, who said he was sorry for me and hoped I would find a job somewhere. I understand that you can't all go out of your way and hunt up jobs for other people. But, what puzzles me is what does it mean to follow Jesus? You sit in a church and talk about following Jesus. You even sing songs about it. Do you mean that you are suffering and denying yourselves the way He did? Are you really following His examples? Would He even consider helping the destruction of the church so a casino could be built in its place? Would he take bribes from corrupt officials and run graphic tabloid photographs in His newspaper? Would He use His God-given talents to lead young people astray? Would He throw others out on the street, just to make a buck? Would He abandon His congregation and community at the most critical time because of His own personal issues? What would the world be like today if everybody tried to act as Jesus did? So what is the lesson here? When you find yourself struggling with life's difficult decisions, ask yourself this one simple question... What would Jesus do? The heart is beating. Somebody call a doctor. Where is the Doctor? He left. How is he doing? He is resting. The doctor said he is a sick man. Probably in his final stages of cancer. Should we get him to a hospital? No. The doctor is running some tests. He said there is probably nothing more that can be done. I just want to keep him here, let him rest and make his last days as comfortable as possible. Let's go. I haven't seen you in months, then twice in one week. What brings you here to see me? The thing in church the other day is really messing with me. A thing like that can be very traumatic. How is the man doing? He is resting. The doc says it doesn't look good for him. He came to my office looking for work the other day and I just ran him off. I feel so bad. Take a sit. So you have been feeling bad since the incident? I don't know how to describe it. It's like an overwhelming emptiness. A sadness that I can't shake. Maybe you should seek professional help. You sound depressed. Isn't that what I'm doing right now? I'll help you anyway I can. But you know I'm no longer the pastor? - I know. - Ok. Listen, I have some extra money... I want to give it to the church. Thank you. I've been here twenty years and I've never gotten a donation like this. I just thought it might help. You are very kind, but it's going to take a lot more than this to save this church. I know Reverend, but it's a start. Well Diana, as you can see I'm moving out today. But I'll make sure this check get's to the pastor of the new church. But what if we wanted our old church and pastor back? I don't think that is possible. Henry, I have heard you many times preach that with God anything is possible. Yes I did, but I've come to doubt many of the things that I have taught over the years. Have you lost your faith, pastor? Let's just say, I have been tested beyond my capacity to endure. I remember something else you taught us. What's that? The Lord does not challenge us with more than we can handle. Our best daily sales ever. What I lack in experience I will make up with hard work. I don't hire strangers, never have, never will... What's the problem? Nothing. Feels great, doesn't it. Mr York. That's my cue to leave. I've been very happy with how you've been covering the election. This is the biggest buzz we've had over an election in years. Is there a particular reason you dropped by to see me? I have some more pictures for you. You've been supplying the pictures? I hope I can count on your newspaper for the election? We'll see how it goes. Don't go soft on me now. - We're almost there. - Sure. What's the matter? I'm not hungry. You must have some odd jobs I could help out with. Honest or not, leave or I'll call the police. It's the land deal, isn't it? I don't think I want to do it. Why not? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? We're tearing down an institution of good, for one devoted to evil. But we are going to build a bigger and better church. The whole event today has really made me think. You're talking about that man at church? Of course. You can't base a business decision on the ravings of a lunatic. I just don't feel right about this land deal. I mean we are building a casino. That's right, a casino that's going to give people jobs, money, self respect, happiness, and so on... Since when did you start worrying about other people? I'll pretend I did not hear that. Jim, I have a few questions about the songs. Ok, shoot. Well, I like most of the songs, but these two are... Well... What's wrong with these? I don't think they're right for my audience. They're a little too explicit. Times have changed. We have to shake things up. The songs just capture how things are. But... Max, trust me on this. I've been in this business a while and I know what sells. Here is the advance I promised. Get some new clothes. If you're going to be a star you gotta look like one. Oh, did you sign the contract yet? I haven't yet. I'm sorry. That church incident really shook me up, it's got my mind a little scattered. Well get it un-scattered. You need to concentrate on what's important in your life. Like signing that contract for starters. I know I just want to look it over again. I'll get it to you in the morning. I need a little more time, ok? I have a plane to catch tomorrow afternoon I'll come in the morning to get this signature. A package from our friend. We won't run this stuff any more. What's wrong with you? Nothing is wrong with me. Are you crazy? These are gold. I don't want them in my paper any more. But these are ours exclusively. I don't care. I no longer want this filth in my paper. What has made you change your mind? If Jesus was the editor, do you think He would print this? I almost believed, Diana... Some kind of a joke. Right? No joke. Diana, let's face it, you've been under a lot of pressure lately. You need a vacation. Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Sunny beaches... No, what I want is to live my life as He would. But you're not Him; for starters you're a woman. I'm not trying to be Him, I'm trying to live like Him. I'm so glad I turned down the profit sharing. What are you doing? Writing a new song? No. Just playing around. What's up? I picked up some groceries; I will make us a nice dinner tonight. Sounds great. So, did you sign the contract? Is it one of the songs you were playing? Yeah. - It was beautiful. - Thank you. - Keep it up, never stop. - I won't. Come sit down, Mum. What's going on, Max? I turned it down. What? You wanted this more than anything in the world. I do. But I can't promote sinning, just so I can sing. It's only singing. How are we going to pay the rent now? What about my promise to your father, to myself to give you a better life? Private vocal lessons? I washed every single toilet in this town, Max. I know, mum. But I also know this is what Jesus would have done. Jesus. Are you insane young man? I'm so sorry Mum. But, I have to do this. Max, you're being a fanatic. What about when we're living in the streets? Mum if I have to live in the streets to stand up for what I believe in, then so be it. How is he? He's resting. He's a very sick man. What is it? It could be cancer. I'll know more when his blood tests come back. I'll be by to check on him the day after tomorrow. Thank you, doctor Walsh. - Take care, Henry. - Thanks. How did you get in here? Apples. Wonderful creation. So bright. So shiny. So tempting. And they're loaded with nutrients. No thanks. What do you want? Where's the story? What story? Don't play coy with me. I'm not running it. What makes you think you have a choice? It's my paper. This is my town, everything in it is mine. Including your little newspaper. We will see about that. Are you prepared to lose everything? Are you threatening me? Get out of my office. This is not over. Heavenly Father, bring your life into my life. Tell me what I must do to serve You. Are you ok, pastor? You don't look well. Things are really tough in this town right now. People just aren't coming to church. Isn't that when people need the Lord most, when times are tough? What are all of you doing here? Can we talk with you a minute, Pastor? It's Henry. I'm not your Pastor any more, but come on in. So... What's up? It's about what took place in the church last Sunday. You mean with the man? Yes, How is he doing? The doc checks on him each day. Not much change in his condition. He's sleeping right now. What he said made us all take stock of our lives. I'm glad you all are searching for meaning in your lives. That's important. It's almost as if he was sent to give us a message. It's obvious to me that there is a great yearning for spiritual fulfilment in this town. Reverend? It's Henry. Yes. Remember what the stranger said. "What would Jesus do?" And, what do you think he would He do? He would save this church. Save the church? That's impossible. It's going to be torn down tomorrow morning. Henry, what's happened to your faith? With faith nothing is impossible. If you've come looking for faith, you've come to the wrong place. But shouldn't we at least try? Pastor, we need you. Henry, that's right he called you Pastor. You are our Pastor. Be our Pastor. Lead us. "Be shepherds of God's flock that is under your care, serving as overseers-not because you must, but because you are willing." Heavenly Father, give me strength. All right. Let me get something straight with you right now. This ain't going to be easy. That's the old Henry I once knew. But how are we going to do it? We are going to ask ourselves one simple question. What would Jesus do? Ok, but how does that save the church? We all agree right now right here, that whatever lies ahead of us, we will act as He would act. So we are going to base all our decisions on what Jesus would do? Like the WWJD Bracelets? Exactly. So, who is with me? I'm in. Me too. Of course I'm in. So, WWJD on three. WWJD. Good. Mr York, are you sure this is right? I feel weird tearing down a church. Son, that's not a church, that's a dried up old shell of a building. If you say so. All right boys. Let's tear this down. Get out of the way, Henry. I will not let you tear down this house of the Lord. I've got a permit to tear this building down. If he won't move, then run him over. I'm getting paid to tear a building down, not run over a preacher. Get off there. I'll do this myself. I won't say it again. Get out of my way. That book you're holding won't stop this bulldozer. The Lord is my strength and my shield. Stop. I am the owner of this property and have paperwork from City Hall stopping the demolition. We're not tearing anything down today, Mr York. It's over, York. You are not destroying this church today. I have a permit to tear this building down. Not today, Mr York. Let's pack it up boys. You may have won a small battle but I will still win the war. We will see about that. Virginia... Your mother is not going to be happy about this. Then I guess it's a good thing that I own the Church and not her. You know we haven't heard the last of him. The Lord's house is once again open. Ok. Let's get inside, come. Thanks, have a nice day. If anyone here is going to quit, do it now. No hard feelings. No one is going to quit. This is our church and we are going to save it. I'm really proud of you, Virginia. For the first time in my life, I feel good about what I am doing. Me to. I feel like a kid again. We've got a lot of work to do. I feel there is something I should tell all of you. Especially you, Max. What is it? I'm partners with Mr Clayton in some of those low income homes that have been kicking people out. Like the one you live in, Max. You? All this time and it was you? I'm so sorry Max. You're supposed to be one of us. I am. I was involved in that before I asked the Lord into my life. Max, we all are different people now. Wanna know? You're as bad as Mr Clayton. How dare you sit in this church? Don't say that, please, Max. Max, please forgive me. I didn't know. Forgive? No, no. Why should I forgive you? You were going to throw my family out in the cold. Wait, Max, because that is what Jesus would do. He even forgave those who hung him on the cross. Sit down, relax. This is all pretty overwhelming. I will talk with Mr Clayton. We will move families back into their old homes. - Will you go to the Square? - Yes. There's more everyone. At the last City Council meeting, Alex York introduced a motion to make gambling legal. It's being considered. If he becomes Mayor the motion will pass. What are we going to do about this? We need to get to the root of the problem. We should take part in this coming election. Put our own candidate in. That's a great idea. How do we get own person elected? We need to take away that which gives him power. The people who have been drawn to him in town. This won't change. Thanks for coming out tonight, everyone. Coming out? We are stuck here. Mr York will say things are fine here in this town. He will lead you to believe that good times are ahead. Right on. You bet. But that is not what I see here. I see a place that has died. A place that is inhabited by people that are starving for salvation. What? Go away. Ladies and gentlemen, listen to me, bringing a casino to our city is not the answer. Get out of here. Go away. Stop. Please listen. Give me all your money. Get behind the fence. Keep your mouth shut. - Give me the cross. - Ok, I'll take it. Hurry up. - Wait, it's caught somewhere. - Break it then. No, no. It was a gift from my wife. Take it but don't break it. Please. Keep it. You can go now. Thank you, but why? Don't you remember me? Do you know me now? No, sorry. Five years ago my wife and children were killed in a fire. I remember. I read about your crash, and what happened to your family. Life can be cruel. Do you remember how you spent all day trying to find me a job? And how I promised to turn my life around? Thank you. Wait. - Have you kept your promise? - No. And when I read about your family, I knew if that could happen to a man of God like you, then there is no God. The Lord has a plan for each and every one of us. My mother used to pray. I can see her now kneeling down by my bed when I was a kid. Didn't help her either. Maybe I can help you. The devil's foreclosed on me already. I'm done. I feel your pain. What did you say? I said I feel your pain. My job is to make you ready. I feel your pain, brother. That's what the other man said to me... What man? The man from your church. Come with me. Let's get a cup of coffee and talk. Miss Paige. I trust you came to your senses. I want to buy some of your properties. Which ones? Some of the rundown buildings in the Square. Why would you want to buy those almost worthless properties? They are not worthless to the families that live there. You know about our Church's efforts. I would never believe you to be part of this non-sense. But seeing is believing. I am very much a part of it. The problem is none of you are Jesus. We're not saying we are. Virginia. You know my son Jimmy. He's all I have left. A great kid but he doesn't have the brains. I need to leave him with something. You want to leave him a bunch of run down empty flop houses, when you could leave him a nice nest egg instead? Are you ok? I'm fine, but you almost hit me. Are you crazy? You jumped in front of my car. I can't believe you turned down the deal. I can't believe I even considered it. I'm considering reporting it to the DA's Office. I really liked you Virginia, don't spoil it. You're hurting me. Poor Virginia, just a lost, confused, pathetic little rich girl. Please stop. You're hurting me. Hey what's going on over there? Are you ok lady? I'll deal with you later. Are you ok? I think so. How can I thank you? Can I give you a ride home? I am home. You live here on the streets? Yes. How old are you? Twenty. Come with me. - Where are we going? - My house. I at least owe you a hot meal. So how old are you really? Seventeen. That's so young. You are the people that are trying to save the church. I'm one of them. How did you know? Hey, I live on the streets. Word gets around. Would you like to help us? Sometimes I wish there was something I could do. What's stopping you? What can I do? I struggle just to survive. Maybe I can help you with that, if that's what you want. I do. But why would someone like you help me? Because that's what Jesus would do. You can wear these till we get you some decent clothing. How did you become like this? I inherited this house from my... That's not what I mean, how did you become this way, you know, so nice, kind? I haven't always been a very good person, but I'm learning. What should I do with your clothing? You can put them in the trash. I never want to wear those clothes again. Have a good night rest. I will see you in the morning. - Miss Paige. - Yes, dear. I don't think you are a bad person. Look what you are doing for me. Like I said, I'm learning. Now get some sleep. Good night. Good Night. What's this all about? This doesn't concern you. Who did you bring home with you? A girl from the Square. She's in trouble and has no home. From the square. Are you for real? That girl is going to rob us blind. She's not a bad girl; she is just down on her luck. Down on her luck? The Square's full of people like that. Take her back. She won't be safe there. Well then here, take her to a hotel and give her money for food. Mother for once can you forget about money. Are you going through some sort of guilt phase in life? No I am going through a learning phase. I will not stay in the same house with a miserable... Mother, this house is mine. Dad left it to me. Your are welcome to stay here as long as you like. But I must act as I believe Jesus would in my place. You can always remember that you have driven your mother out of your house in favour of a homeless street girl. Is that what Jesus would do? I am not driving you out. I am helping someone who needs it. And yes, I believe that is what Jesus would do. - How is the young girl doing? - She's resting. There was a very pretty young lady under all that dirt. Would you like me to make you some tea? No. Sit down and I will make you a cup. - Me? - Yes. How long have you worked for me? Ten years. Have I ever given you a raise? A raise? Well... No. Well that is going to change starting tomorrow. Maria, over the past ten years you have been a true and loyal friend. You have been there every time I have needed you. I have not taken the time to stop and thank you for all your hard work. Miss Page, you don't have to say... Yes I do, and by the way, from now on call me Virginia. Friends don't call each other by last names. Ok, then pass the cream, "Virginia". No problem. Has anyone seen Virginia? She went into town to have breakfast with Reverend Maxwell. Sit down, I'll get you some breakfast. So you are the girl that my daughter brought home last night. Yes, your daughter is helping me get back on my feet. You are a pretty young lady, you don't look like you belong on the streets. No one belongs on the streets; You don't plan to end up there, sometimes it just happens. Well how did you end up in the square? My father left my mother and I, when I was ten years old. We were basically left with nothing. My mother worked very hard to try and make ends meet. She cleaned houses during the day and waited tables at night. Thank you, this looks wonderful. Things were really tough for us. Then when I was fifteen, she started to get sick. She died of cancer a year later. And I have been on my own ever since. Do you mean to tell me that you have been on your own since you were sixteen? Yep. All alone. What about your family? I don't have any that I know of. Well young lady, you have one now. What do you say you and I head into town and get you some clothes for a pretty young lady? Ok. That would be awesome. Maria, bring the car around. We are going shopping. Of course, Mrs Paige. We've gained fifty new members since our last meeting and support is growing. Soon we will be able to win back our church. Virginia has agreed to run against Alex York. It is imperative that Alex York does not turn our town into an unholy nightmare. Pastor how are we going to do this? By offering the people what he cannot. What is that? Love, understanding and most of all, an example of how to live. Sir, could you remove this ad behind me? Thank you. It's been nice having you here these last few days. It's been nice having a roof over my head. You need more than a roof over your head. A young girl like you needs a home. I've learned that dreams don't always come true. You're right. Oh by the way I forgot to give you something. What's that? They're a new set of keys to the house. I.P.? I. P... Loren Paige. Paige, but that's your last name. Loren I want you to come and live with me. I want you to be my daughter. Ladies and gentlemen, soon I'll introduce to you the person who will clean this town, return the pride to Raymond, California. Our candidate and the next mayor, Virginia Paige. But before that, I want you to know. Since we started, crime has been reduced 55%, and soon we will be able to return all of you to your homes. Look, it's York. How can you do this to yourselves? To even consider these Jesus freaks? You still have no jobs, no real future and to top it off, you have to live in the shadow of fear and repression. I've been working months to bring great things to Raymond. Money, jobs, self respect. They want you to live in fear of what happens when you stray from the Jesus pitch? There are two worlds we can build in Raymond. One is built on the concepts of peace, kindness, and good-will. The other is an empty life of cheap thrills, ugliness, and greed. We are offering you the first. But you need to take the first step and reject this man and the easy path. You have to do what's right. I'm ready to defend this town... This ends today. You and me. Right here, right now... We are talking about jobs, health insurance, low cost housing, what else could you possibly want? Wake up people. Is this what we have left? Fear? You don't need them. The man in the church that day was right. We have to do what is right in our hearts. We all know that. Where are you going? Get back here... You're done, York. You fools, what are you doing? You won't make a difference on election day. I'm the future... Get out of here York. Leave... Now... It's over. Go ahead and have your little meeting. It will all be over when I win the election. Don't you get it. The people want me. I am what they need, not a bunch of Jesus freaks. Are we ready...? ok. Here we go. In a landslide election, Alex York lost his bid to become mayor of Raymond today... Our new Mayor Virginia Paige and she hopes to bring new hope to Raymond. Congratulations on your new album. Thanks. I can't wait to get into the studio again. I imagine. - Talk with you later. - Ok. Very good. Looks nice. Henry, how is he doing? This morning when I went in to check on him, he was gone. I guess it was his time to move on. I guess so. Excuse me I need to get this started. Ladies and Gentleman, can I have your attention please? First off let's hear it for our new mayor, Virginia Page. Did he just wink at you? Stop it mum, we're in church. Is there something going on with you two? Well, he did invite me to the church picnic. Open your bible to First Peter, chapter 2 verses eleven and twelve. "Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world to abstain from sinful desires which war against your soul." "Live such good lives among the pagans, that," though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on "the day He visits us." Before I go on, I would like to ask our good friend Max Walker to come up here on stage. Come, Max. I've asked Max to play his new song for us. He will do this right now. Thanks pastor. Over the last month or so, we've done a lot of good and changed a lot of things around here. We did it by asking ourselves one simple question.
