[CELL PHONE RINGING] [CELL PHONE RINGING] - Hello? - [JENNIFER SCREAMING] [JENNIFER] Oh, my gosh, Mo, you won't believe this, you won't believe it! - [SCREAMS] - Who's this? - Jennifer? - I could not believe it. We were in the middle of Oxford Street, and, oh, my God, he proposed! What a big rock this is. It's just so...[EXCLAIMS] - He proposed? - Yes, yes, yes. I am sending you the picture of the ring right now. It's so beautiful. Gosh! I am so excited. He proposed right in the middle of... [MO] Okay. Don't get it twisted. This isn't me being upset or angry or jealous. I mean, why should I be? Jennifer is one of my oldest friends, and I'm happy she's getting married. But, still, why isn't it me making this call? [JENNIFER] Okay. We have a wedding to plan, and I need you to do it. Mo? Hello, Mo? You there? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm here. I'm here. Okay. I'll be coming home by Wednesday to set things in motion. And I have a list of things... [MO] Typical Jenny.[SIGHS] Always sending you on errands. But, hey...[CHUCKLES] It's her wedding and she's my friend. Okay. Right, right, right. So what do you want to start with? - Your fruits, honey. - Oh, thank you, love. Just the way you like it. One fork? - Aren't you eating any? - No. Breakfast was quite filling. I don't want any. - No, you're not going to bribe me. - [LAUGHS] I'm not going to eat any of this if you don't have some. - Okay, fine, I'll join you. [LAUGHS] - Okay, here we go. Here. Ooh, you wanted... You prefer watermelons, - don't you? - Mmm-hmm. - I'm going to stuff you. - Yeah, you're trying to cheat me - off of my watermelon. - How about another? [ANNA] Love you. [TUNDE] Love you too, girl. Good morning, Dad, Mum. Good morning, dear. How are you? - Good. - [TUNDE] All right. What time did you come in last night, young woman? - Mum, you know I had an event. - So? That doesn't give a woman the right to come in at ungodly hours. I don't like this job. Can we not do this this morning? You made that very clear from the beginning, but this my job, I love it. But I don't like the fact that you come in so late at night. It worries me, Mo. Say something, Tunde Don't worry, love. I hate us to worry. You won't have to worry about her by the time she moves to her husband's house. - Which I hope will be soon. - [ANNA] Me too. You plan other people's events. I think it's time we planned yours, don't you think? Have you ever thought that maybe some of us aren't as lucky as the two of you when it comes to finding love? Oh, nonsense. There's a man out there for you. All you have to do is open your eyes. I remember when I met your father. Oh! He was standing right there by... I've heard this story a thousand times. I'd appreciate it if you didn't recount it again, especially not today. [TUNDE SIGHS] - Are you all right, Mo? - I just want to be left alone. I don't want to talk about falling in love or getting married. Are you okay? - Do you want to talk about it? - [MO] No! [SIGHS] [CLICKS TONGUE] [SIGHS] [MUMBLES] Pick up your phone. [AUTOMATED VOICE] Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. - At the tone, please record... - Seriously? Can't call them for when you want them. [SIGHS] Mmm. [KEYBOARD CLACKING] Okay. Don't know how this thing works. But, uh... Okay. Let's give this a go. Go with the flow. Hi. My name is Moduroti Bankole-Smith, but you can call me Mo. So. I was just wondering, how does a single girl get hooked up in Lagos these days? And I'm not talking random dates or a series of relationships that are leading nowhere, no. I'm talking about finding love. Real love. Love that leads to marriage. The kind of love that has you at 60 still eating off the same plate, and laughing at each other's jokes, and has you gazing into each other's eyes as if you just met for the first time. The kind of love I don't think exists anymore. I mean, you think you're fine, got a brain between your ears, homely, good conversation, hardworking, and generally a good catch. Until your friend calls you and tells you she's getting married. As in no offense, but I better pass that girl by far. And don't get it twisted. I am not beefing or anything. No, I'm not. I'm just wondering, like, where are all the good guys? Where are they? [EXCLAIMS] I can't believe this girl is actually getting married. You're kidding. [LAUGHS] Jennifer, of all people, is getting married. - I need to swallow that with a cold drink. - [SNAPS FINGERS] [MO] That's Tseju. Downright blunt and sarcastic. Sometimes to a fault, but she's fun to be with. She's lively and knows how to have a good time. Basically, she's your typical life-of-the-party kind of girl. If you're bored, call Tseju. I hope she doesn't think it's going to be a walk in the park or something. I mean, she's getting married. This girl can't even tie her own shoelaces, talk less of handling a man. - Tseju. - What? Come on, that's not fair. [MO] That's Tobe. The perfect gentleman. He's caring, generous, sensitive, and as good as they come. He's the one person I can tell anything to without fear of being judged or criticized or having all my dirty laundry hung out in the open. Anyway, if you ask me, Jennifer is not that bad. Really? You have met her, right? - Well... - Mo, back me up here. - Huh? What? - [TSEJU] Seriously? What are you up to? I actually can't believe this. People are watching this thing I've had five hits. - What are you talking about? - That. - You started a vlog? - You're kidding. Yeah. I started a vlog... And it's actually thanks to the both of you. You, I called you and you didn't pick up. And you, your phone was unavailable and I needed someone to talk to. And so you started a vlog? You are so spoilt. [TSEJU] You needed to talk to someone, so you talked to the whole world? - And I did call you back. - Yeah, two days later. And what's wrong with a vlog anyways? I mean, a girl needed to vent, and I found an outlet. Oh, please, don't give us that, "Jennifer is getting married. - "I'm so upset I'm still single." - [TOBE CHUCKLES] I can't believe I ordered a drink five minutes ago and it's still not here. Come on. You know Tseju. Ignore her. - So did it really help? - Yes! Like I said, I actually can't believe it. Five hits. People are watching this thing. I can't... I don't get it. Okay, I just got us a large glass, a pitcher, of margaritas. So, get ready. - What are you trying to do? Get us drunk? - Turn up! - There is work tomorrow now, though, guys. - [CLICKS TONGUE] Uh! Oh, babe, relax. [SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] - Turn down! - [BOTH SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] [BOTH LAUGH] You girls can't do that. I expect everyone I work with to behave in a professional manner, including my ushers. This company has a reputation to keep, so you cannot, under any circumstance whatsoever, insult a guest at an event. But, Mo, he was the one that started it. Are you telling me you've never heard the expression, "The client is always right"? He's not our client. The bride and groom were our clients. You're... You're kidding me, right? Any guest at any event is a potential client. So can't just talk to them or behave anyhow! [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [MAN] Ah, hey. - Uh, is everything okay? - Yes, I'm just addressing an issue. [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] All right, okay, guys. Carry on what you're doing, okay? Great job. Bimpe! Sorry, Mo. Do you know what? All of you get out! Get out of my office. Sorry, Mo. [SIGHS] Thanks, but no thanks. [KISSES TEETH, SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] - [CELL PHONE RINGING] - [SIGHS] [CELL PHONE RINGING] Hi, Mum. Yeah, I'm just about to leave the office. Okay, okay, I'll stop at the supermarket on my way home. Oluwanimoduroti Bankole-Smith? - Mary Chougule. [LAUGHS] - Oh, come here! [BOTH LAUGH] [MO] Don't be fooled by the smiles. We were more rivals than friends back in secondary school. Whatever I wanted, Mary wanted. From boys to grades, anything you can think of. It was a relief to lose her shadow after school. I can't imagine her setting her fangs into my man now. If I had one. You know, the moment I saw your back, I just knew it was you. - [LAUGHING AWKWARDLY] - You haven't changed much. You apparently have. You put on some weight. - [CHUCKLES] I have? - Yeah! Well, that's what happens when you have a baby. And my husband loves my shape and he is absolutely... You're married? And you have a baby? [MO] The universe is definitely playing tricks on me. [SCOFFS] So Mary finally has something I don't have. - Yes, darling. - [BOTH LAUGHING] Oh, he's into imports and exports, and, you know, he's loving, caring and generous. - We've got the cutest baby in the world. - Aw, that's nice. [MARY] He's going to be three months in four days. Oh? [MARY] I should have a picture of my son here. - [INAUDIBLE] - Um... You know I can't believe how we used to fight over dating the same guy in school. [BOTH LAUGHING] - Of course. - Silly things we did as teenagers. - Uh, huh, yeah. - Where's this picture? So what about you? What does your husband do? Um... It was so good seeing you. Congratulations on your baby. I'll see you around. - Bye! - Hold on. Wait, my picture... Oh, hey, Mo Where are the groceries I asked you to buy on the way home? - Did you leave them in the car? - Good evening, Mum. No, I didn't. [ANNA] So, where are they? [MO] They didn't have anything in the shop. - Everything? - [MO] Yes. - Why didn't you check somewhere else? - [MO] It didn't occur to me, Mum. [EXHALES] [EXHALES DEEPLY] [GROANS] [MO] This is not me being desperate. But you never know how love will find you. The truth is, I don't believe in Internet dating, but who knows? I might just meet Mr. Perfect. I mean, what harm could come from this? None. I hope. Okay, Mo, if you're going to do this, just do it. Don't chicken, just do it. [SIGHS] Everyone does it. People find love online these days. [SIGHS] People know more people. They find love, they get married... [SIGHS] Who am I kidding? No man worth his salt wants to date a 28-year-old he met on the Internet. But you're widening your options, that's all you're doing. Just widening your options. Nobody has to know. Apart from the guy you're going to date. [SIGHS] Am I actually doing this? Like, really? This is what it has come to. Okay. Just do it. It's cool. Just do it. Just do it. - [COMPUTER BEEPS] - Ugh! [SIGHS] Thank you, Mary. Thank you very much. I can't believe I just did that. [GROANS] This is ridiculous. {an8}[BEEPS] {an8}[BEEPS] {an8}[BEEPS] {an8}[BEEPS] For real? [TAPS KEY] What? {an8}[BEEPING] [LAUGHS] This thing is fast. [KEYBOARD CLACKING] Mmm, okay. [KEYBOARD CLACKING] [CELL PHONE RINGING] [CELL PHONE RINGING] [CLEARS THROAT] Hello? Hi, yes. This is Mo. Who's speaking? Oh, Leo? Hi. [LAUGHS] [LAUGHING] Yes. Oh, thank you. Hey, love. - How are ya? - Hey, I'm good. How are you? I'm good, chilling. Hey, we haven't spoken in a while, huh? I know it's not like me to not call, but you know how hectic it can get at the banks. But for you, man, come on! You can't even pick up your phone to call someone. Yes, and, uh, can't even talk right now 'cause I'm actually on my way out. Oh, yeah? Where you going? - Our spot? - No. On a date. [STAMMERING] A date? Oh, for real? With who? Nobody you know. Look, I'll give you the gist later. I have to go. So I can't even see you today? It's our special day. And look at me keeping my hopes up. Please, Mo. Please. Tell me I'm not stuck with that crazy Tseju girl. [LAUGHS] You guys will have fun without me, jo. Bye! [CHUCKLES] I know, but she... Mo? [MO] Hi. [LAUGHS] Um, sorry. Have we met before? I'm sorry. I thought you were Leo. Sorry. [LAUGHS] [WAITRESS] Hi. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] I'm actually waiting for someone. Yeah. Come back after. Thanks. Okay, okay. [MO] Mmm-mmm-mmm. I'll forgive you again. Ah! You being serious? Mo, right? I'm Leo. [MO] You have got to be kidding me. Of all the guys out there, I get Steve Urkel? Really? Imagine the look on Tseju's face if I showed up with a guy like this. She'll probably die of a heart attack. Oh, no way this is going to work. [LAUGHS] I'm sorry I think you have the wrong girl. It's a joke, isn't it? I saw your picture on the Internet. I said you have the wrong girl. Uh, but... But, it's... {an8}[SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] [KISSES TEETH] [TSEJU AND TOBE LAUGHING] [MO] What's funny now? - [LAUGHING] Everything. - [TOBE LAUGHS] What's funny about it? - [LAUGHING] A lot. - [TSEJU LAUGHING] [SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] It's not funny, it's hilarious, man. Oh, my God. You know what? For once, I have to agree with Tseju. It's some crazy story. [SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] At least I found a way to escape - instead of being stuck in a boring... - Oh, no, no, no, no. Come on, Mo! The fact that the guy is a nerd doesn't mean he's going to be boring. You didn't give him a chance to get to know you. [SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] Don't make her hear words. - You seriously need help. - [TOBE LAUGHS] Of all the ways to meet a guy... Online dating? Babe, that's a cry for help. I thought it was worth a try. You're an events planner, for goodness sakes. You meet guys day in, day out. You could just hook up with any of them - when it comes to... - No, no, no, no. Time out, time out. Come on now. Tseju, that's totally unprofessional. The girl is an event planner. You don't expect her to hook up with guys at events she plans. - Exactly. - Oh, please. And you. You don't think you're taking this too far? You need to chill out, man. It will come to you naturally, yeah? It isn't easy for everyone like it is for you. Like, you can go outside and pick any girl. Come on, Mo. I don't want any girl. I want one girl. [CLEARS THROAT] Anyway. Look, we're not talking about you. We are talking about my dating life, okay? And you seriously need help. So you said a thousand times. Please help me, Tseju. First of all, you need to, I don't know, go out more. - Like, this, I don't know, you... - Know what, ladies? I'll call it a night here. See you guys later. [CLICKS TONGUE] You were saying? First lesson. You need to see the guy's picture before you agree to a blind date. Yeah, but then it wouldn't be a blind date, then, would it? Who goes on a blind date in this age of modern technology? And this is Lagos. Trust me, the men are out there. From the billionaires, who are loaded, and usually good-looking. But even if they aren't, who cares? And then, of course, there are the corporate guys. Those you catch in the clubs, restaurants, lounges on a Friday night. Some are married, some are not. Some are millionaires or millionaires in the making. And then, of course, we have the scrubs. And, my dear, this is a niche where you find a lot of eligible bachelors, and plenty single girls. This, my friend, is where the game is played. And to win? You have to set yourself apart. [CLUB MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] Please stop doing that. But you know this dress is too short for me, and I don't like short things, so it makes me feel like I am desperate. Think of the dress as an attractive package for a brand new toy or a fancy gadget that has plenty of benefits to offer. Excuse me, but I am not a toy! Figure of speech. Basically what I am saying is nobody is going to look in your direction if you don't have the right package on the outside. Okay? Regardless of whatever you have on the inside. Men are drawn by... What they see. You told me a thousand times. Good. So you're paying attention. Now put a smile on your face. Turn around. Let's work this. - [YELPS] - Sorry, I'm so sorry... Hi. - Hi. - Uh... Can I buy you a drink? Okay. Yeah, sure. The thing is, we pour the liquid cement into any kind of shape we want it to take. If you need to alter the shape, you have to make sure that - it is still in liquid form. - Mmm-hmm. I love being a civil engineer. So much so that my friend thinks that, because I love it so much, I don't have time for fun. That's why he dragged me here. - Cheers. - Cheers. [MO] That explains a lot. He's been talking about his work for the past 30 minutes. I'm here to have some fun and meet an interesting guy, not to be talked to death. One more thing about his precious work and I am out of here. Believe me. Oh, wow... Uh, I think we have to take off very soon 'cause I have a floor plan to check tomorrow and I'm starting... - I'm going to need another drink. - Okay, I'll get you one... No! - [LAUGHS] No, no, no, no. I'm fine. - You sure? - I'll get one myself. - Okay. Oh, please, please sit. Thank you. [LAUGHS] I know some really good real estate, though. - Oh, this is my friend Mo. - Hi, nice to meet you. I'm leaving. Are you coming? Would you like me to drop you home or are you staying? - What's going on? What's happened? - I'm leaving. Do you want to stay or would you like me to drop you at home? I'll see you later. Bye. Nice to meet you. Yes, Tseju. I'm tired. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll talk to you tomorrow. I'll talk to you tomorrow, okay? All right, bye. [MUMBLES] Bye. I love you. Bye. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [ANNA WHISPERING] Mo? Mo? Are you there? I think I heard her come in just now. [TUNDE WHISPERING] Her car is parked outside. Look, maybe she's tired. [ANNA] Perhaps the date went well. - [CHUCKLES] - [TUNDE] Perhaps it did. We'll get the details tomorrow. Come on, love. Let's go to bed. Let's do this. Okay. Hi, it's your girl Mo again. I know I've been MIA for a little while, but it's just 'cause I have been really busy. So, yes, last time I was wondering how a single girl in Lagos could get hooked and find true love. So, I went and experimented. See what I could find. First thing I learned, the hard way, of course, is never ever agree to go on a date with a guy before you know what he looks like. Because, trust me, you might just be shocked out of your skin. Secondly, dress comfortably. Don't wear six-inch heels. Like, look good. Make sure you look good. But, my sister, your feet follow. Right now, my feet are killing me. And the worst part about it is, the man won't even notice the heels. Trust me. All he is interested is in, up here. So, yes. The first day of my experiment, I met this guy, the most boring, uninteresting man I have ever met. He went on and on and on about his job, and just when I thought things couldn't get any worse... [LAUGHING] - Ah! - [LAUGHS] - Another drink, please. - You're so funny! [LAUGHS] - I'm glad I could make you laugh. - Aw! [LAUGHS] So, um... - More drinks? - Yes, yes. Barman, please, another drink for the beautiful lady. [LAUGHS] You're so kind. And what is it? [GRUMBLES] That's your ex-boyfriend. No, no, no, no! You're jealous? Hell, no! That's my boss. And he's having fun, so you should, too. - Okay? - Okay. [LAUGHS] That's better. - So, tell me, you're an event planner. - Yeah. Sounds so interesting, now. How well does it pay? It's not too bad. Hmm... [BOTH LAUGHING] Come on, this man. How much, um... How much is my bill, please? [BOTH CHUCKLING] [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] I think I misplaced my wallet. [CHUCKLES DRYLY] Oh, God, this is... This is so embarrassing. Hmm... You know... [MO CLEARS THROAT] - Shake it well. - Yeah, I am. This is... Can you... Can you please help me pick the bill this time? [LAUGHING] [MO] You must be joking. For this Lagos? [CHUCKLES] This guy thinks I'm a JJC. I should pick up the tab. Ha! I bet you he's washing all the dishes in the restaurants. I so walked out on him. And then, the adventure got even weirder. Of course, I had to get out from under him. I said he takes the deal, or he gets nothing. - Yes, but don't you think... - In my line of business, you can't afford to be sentimental. - Do you like the food? - Yes, I think it's... It's very nice. It's the best meal here. And, of course, I have ordered the meals. That was the very best. - What about the wine? - It was... Very nice. Classic. [MO] I don't think I've ever met a guy who likes the sound of his own voice this much. Between us, we said 1,500 words. Out of those 1,500 words, he said 1,450. And by then, you'd have thought, I would stop, right? No, Mo keeps going on and on. You're a very beautiful woman. [CHUCKLES] Oh, thank you. Mmm. Mmm. [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] [MO CLEARS THROAT] [LAUGHS] Oh... [MO CLEARS THROAT] I'm really, really thirsty, I'm just gonna... Are you okay? You want me to order for some more drinks? This is fine. Mmm... [MO CLEARS THROAT] Ah. [CHUCKLES] Mmm... I, um... - You're so pretty. - [CLEARS THROAT] Thank you. Get your hands off me! [SIGHS] You know what? I can't and I won't. You're a disgusting little man. Don't smile, don't smile, it's not funny! [CHORTLES] [MO] Ew! Need I say more? The guy just couldn't keep his grimy hands off me. How disgusting. [SCOFFS, CLICKS TONGUE] [MAN] Okay, pass this ball, now! - Hey. - Fun and jokes! What are these boys playing today? You know, it does bring out your temper, because of the flogging that my boys are going to give you today. [SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] {an8}[CHUCKLES] {an8}Tobe? {an8}- Oh, TJ, stop, TJ. - [SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] {an8}- Oh, TJ, stop, stop, stop. - What is he watching? {an8}[SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] {an8}- Fake guy. - Guys, this is none of your business... {an8}[SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] {an8}Why don't you just tell her you like her? {an8}[SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] {an8}Hey, now, gimme, gimme, gimme. {an8}You see? {an8}- Goal, goal. - Tough guy, lover boy! {an8}[SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] {an8}I need to talk to somebody now. This guy. Give me, now. {an8}Goddamn, relax now, come on. {an8}[SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] Are you... Are you actually sending us out of your house? Because we're telling you the truth? And I heard you, now... {an8}[SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] [CLICKS TONGUE] [MO] So, now, I'm beginning to think that maybe I'm the problem. I'm the constant in all these...[MUFFLED] ...maybe being myself just isn't enough. I don't know why you're bothering yourself, Tseju, because I'm not going. But it's going to be so much fun. Uh, I've had enough fun to last me a lifetime. I'm not interested. Okay, so you've had a couple of sour dates. Are you gonna give up? Look, for every twelve, there's always a Judas. And I've had five Judases. No Peter, no James, no John. All thanks to you. What's that supposed to mean? Uh, after the first day at the club, I should've stopped. But no, you convinced me to go on another date. And another date, and another date! Oh, so, it's my fault that the guys that you met were wrong for you? I'm just saying, maybe I shouldn't be taking relationship advice from you. Because there's something about my advice that jinxes your relationships? No, because you can't give what you don't have. You don't have a relationship, Tseju. You go from guy to guy to guy to guy. I want something stable, you know, love, marriage, I want a stable relationship, not flings. You're right, Mo. [SIGHS] You know... You're not the only one that has fantasies about fairytale relationships. But this is the real world. [SOBBING] And in the real world, some of us take what we can get. [CHUCKLES] Oh... Oh, wow! You sent me a picture, remember? It's beautiful. I know! I haven't seen you in ages, are you gonna give me a hug? Oh, it's good to see you. - Good to see you, you look amazing. - Oh, you sure? Because I've been going through my beauty treatments and I have been harassing my makeup artist, so... I must look really great. [CHUCKLES] Yeah, but I didn't know you'd hired a makeup artist already. I thought I would do that. Thought I was helping you plan the wedding. Oh, of course you are, darling, but she's brilliant, so I insisted that she must do my makeup. Well, she didn't have much of a choice, considering how much I'm paying her. [BOTH CHUCKLE] The only issue I'm having right now is this heat. - It's not that bad. - Sorry? It's crazy hot in here, even with the ACs. How do you guys cope? Uh, babe, you grew up here. [SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] Which day did you go? Uh-uh. I've been out of this country for eight whole years. [SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] Are you gonna say you've forgotten all the prep nights and dining hall dramas that we had, and all those seniors who hated you, and used to call you... [BOTH] Royal Junior. [LAUGHING] I went to school abroad as well, and when I came back four years ago, I adjusted pretty easily. Well, I'm not you. You know I don't like anything stressful. [CHUCKLES] Oh, right and I like stress? Well, why else would you take on a job as an event planner? [LAUGHS] Yeah, um, great. Here. We are here to plan your wedding. So, how many guests are we expecting? Um, about a thousand. A thousand? Is that a problem? Oh, you can't handle it? No, it's not that. I'm just surprised that you'd wanna spend your special day with so many people. [SCOFFS, LAUGHS] You should know, I don't have a choice. I'm royalty and so is he! You can't expect us to have anything less. It's going to be a carnival. Hmm... Oh, my goodness, you can't handle this, can you? Look, if you can't handle this, my mother knows the best event planner in this country. I just wanted you to have the privilege of organizing my wedding, because, you know, we're friends and all. But like I said, if you can't handle this... Jennifer! - I can handle it. - Okay. Because you know how I like things to be perfect. Now, I'm taking a huge risk with your mediocre company. But, hey, that's what friends are for, right? [BOTH CHUCKLING] [MO] Seriously, this is the person getting married, and not me? I must be part of some cosmic joke. Okay, uh, excellent! So, I'm going to have to work over the budget again, obviously because of the increase in number of guests. But, um, what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna run it by my boss, you know, sort out the numbers and then I will get back to you and then we can set things in motion. Okay, well, like I said, money is not an issue, yeah? As you know, Iyke and I are royalty and we just want to make sure that everything goes, you know, really excellent. You just make sure that you don't disappoint us, okay? [GIGGLES] Yes, Your Highness. Um, so, when is Iyke coming in? Oh, he should be in town with his best man in about one month? Yeah. Well, we have about three months to go, right? So, it's not much of an issue. You'll be surprised at how quickly time flies by when you're planning a wedding. Aw, well, that's why I have you. - To make sure everything goes perfectly. - Yeah, I guess. Okay, um, so I'm going to head back to my office now, and when I sort some stuff out, I'll call you with an update. - No problems. - Excellent. Okay. Let me get my stuff together. Oh, you need to, you know, take me to all those places that you single ladies hang out, you know? [CHUCKLES] Before I tie the knot. For what? Please, leave us single girls alone. Face your marriage. [JENNIFER LAUGHING] Oh, Mo. - Oh, you're back. - Yes. - Welcome back. - Thank you. - Is he in his office? - Yes, he is in the office. -Excellent -But he's with... [LAUGHS] Oh, sorry. [CLEARS THROAT] Get out. Get out. Now! [SHOUTING] Will you move? What the hell is wrong with you? Can't you keep your trousers zipped? Must you sleep with everything with a skirt? [SCOFFS] You're a married man, for God's sake! You have a beautiful wife who sings your praises all day and you want to throw that all away for a stupid tumble in the sack? A lot of people would do anything. They would give anything to have what you have. A forever with someone who loves them and who they can love back! And you wanna throw it away for just... For... For just her? Mo, I... Are you all right? - Are you okay? - [SCOFFS] - I'll come back. - Mo... Mo! [CHUCKLING] It's amazing what people would do to get on television. It's absolutely hilarious, love this thing! - Oh, here you go honey. - Thank you. [BOTH LAUGHING] Good evening, Mum, Dad. - Mmm. - Oh... You're home early. [SIGHS] It's a weekday, Mum. I'm always home early on weekdays. Oh, you haven't been home this early on a Friday night. Right, Tunde? Oh, yes. She probably doesn't have a date this evening. - Right, dear? - Yes, Dad. I don't have a date. And I won't be having any dates for a little while. [EXHALES] I've had a long day. I'm tired, and I just wanna go to bed. Oh, come on, you can't conclusively say that. You never know when love happens. Mum. Look, we're having the Lagudas over. - For lunch on Sunday. After church? - Yeah. Please cancel any appointments that you might have. Why should I do that? Saturdays and Sundays are my busiest days and you know that. Well, I know that, honey, but they're our guests and I'm trying to accommodate them. Do I really have to be there? I'm sure you old folks can have fun without me. Of course you have to be there, silly. Tunde, say something. All right, calm down, love. Mo, do you have any events on that day? - No, but... - Good! I should have been told way before now. What if I did have an event? But you don't. So, that settles that, yeah? Your mom is happy and you're happy. No, Dad, I'm roped in. Thanks a lot. - Oh, honey. - My pleasure. - You look beautiful. - [MO] Really? [LAUGHING] She's so like you. Moduroti. Why on Earth aren't you dressed? I thought I told you the Lagudas are coming over for dinner today. [GROANS] Okay, Mum, I'll throw something on and I'll be down in a few minutes. Well, don't just throw anything on. I want you to look spectacular. Spectacular? - For lunch with the Lagudas? - Well, just look nice. And come down in five minutes, - Mary's already setting the table. - Okay. - Look nice. - Okay, Mum. - Nice. - [CHUCKLES] Spectacular lunch with the Lagudas! [SCOFFS] Oh, I need to get out of here. [LAUGHTER, INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] Ah, good evening, my dear, how are you? [MO] Very well, thank you. Good evening, ma'am. [MRS. LAGUDA] Good evening, darling. How are you? I'm well, thank you very much. [MO CLEARS THROAT] [LAUGHTER, INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] [ANNA WHISPERING] Oh, there's chemistry between them. [WHISPERING CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] [WOMEN LAUGHING] So, Dare, I heard you graduated with honors in the master's program! - That's quite impressive. - Mum! Son, tell me which mother would not be so proud to brag about our only son? [CHUCKLING] Well, yes, it is true. You see? Excellence runs in my lineage. Mmm? Why should it be yours, and not mine? Don't forget, he's as much as my son, as much as he's yours. Oh, well, he doesn't bear your name. He bears mine. [ALL LAUGHING] But that is so true! So true! So, Dare, more the reason why you should stay back and run my company. Uh, Dad, I already told you, I've made arrangements with investors in the UK for my project. I know, I know. That's right, which I don't think is a good idea. Why can't you stay and run my company? Because you're already running it, Dad. You see, that's the problem with children of nowadays, huh? No, leave him alone, yeah. He should have a mind of his own. [LAUGHS] And, Mister, that's true. Mo is gonna drop your name and then take on her husband's name. [WOMEN LAUGHING] That is so true, and she would make a very lovely wife. [MO CLEARS THROAT] I'm sure she will. Last time I saw you, you were a skinny, tall teenager, back then. Very funny. I don't remember you being tall, dark and handsome, yourself. Moduroti. It's okay. I'm sure she feels differently now. Oh, yes! - She would make a very lovely wife. - Yes, she will. And, oh, uh, my mom was right. You did fill out quite nicely. [MR. LAGUDA LAUGHING] That's my boy! Well, hey, I thought you guys were gonna go talk some business over drinks? [MRS. LAGUDA] Yes, that's true. You said you wanted to discuss a business proposal. - Really? - [MRS. LAGUDA] Oh, yes. - What business proposal? - Mmm-hmm. Yes. Yes, sir. [PARENTS CHUCKLING] - And girl, let me show you the fabrics. - Oh, okay, sweetie... You guys enjoy yourselves. Huh. What are these two women up to? Seems like they're trying to match make us when we have already... Shhh! They never knew we were an item back then. They're probably somewhere spying on us, as well. [SIGHS] So, when did you get back? Uh, few days ago. I came in for an important event. Right, and you didn't think to tell me you were going to be here today? I thought it might be nice to surprise you. - Really? - Really. [MO SCOFFS] Why, aren't you surprised? So, what have you been up to lately? Last I heard, you were out of the country for school. When did you get back? That was four years ago, actually. - Hmm. And then? - I went into events planning. Really? So, basically, you are the errand girl at a party? Wow! You really haven't changed, have you? You're still as arrogant as ever. Look, it might not be as glamorous as oil and gas, but I love it. Relax. I was just joking. Besides, you love the job. That's what matters, right? Yeah. So, how about you and I go for a drink sometime? [SCOFFS] Yeah, so what I'm gonna need from you is I need everything prepared properly, and I mean to the very last detail, because I told you the bride is my friend. And she's very, very, very picky. Yes, okay. All right, uh, yes. I will transfer you the money by the end of today. And, yeah... Okay. All right, no problem, bye. Who was that? The caterers. I was just discussing Jennifer's menu. Okay, um, when is it, again? Three months. Well, two months and two weeks to be exact. - So, everything is okay? - Yes. All right, okay. - I wanted to say... - I want to tell you... [MO EXHALES] I wanted to apologize for the way I spoke to you the other day. I was upset, yes, but I had no right, and it's none of my business. True. It was none of your business. And yes, you absolutely had no right. But even though I am your boss, I consider you a friend. That's why I'm gonna tell you why I... Chase every available thing in skirt that I see. Why? Simply because you're married to this beautiful woman, you love her, she loves you, doesn't mean everything will be perfect. Because, Mo, it never is. There are no fairy tale marriages. Just weddings. I know there are no fairy tale marriages, but there are good... There are great marriages. My parents, they have a great marriage. Like, they love each other so much that it makes me jealous. And I can only hope and wish that I have that someday. You see, life... Life is a vicious circle. Those that a married, want out. Those that are not, want in. Are you saying you want to leave your wife? Can't say it doesn't cross my mind sometimes. - Why? - Because she... She's boring. Oh, no, no, no, don't get me wrong, now. Okay? I mean... [CHUCKLES] She's beautiful, she's homely, she's... And some guys probably like that, but me... I want more. Okay? I want more excitement. I want more adventure. I want someone who's spontaneous, someone who... Who would get me wondering what next step she's going to do. And have you discussed this with her? Not really. Tell her. Tell her what you want. And if she doesn't get it, show her. Just don't stop, just make sure she gets it. You just need to stop... [SIGHS] You need to stop this... Philandering or whatever. There's... There's no justification for adultery. And aren't you even scared? There are, like, STDs out there. You could get an STD and worse still, go home and give her one. [CHUCKLES] [MO] Seriously! Okay. Okay. Since you've so earnestly convinced me, I'll think about it. I'll work on it. Okay. So, can I fire Bimpe? [LAUGHS] She... She's incompetent! Hmm. Nice. - Hello. - Hi. My name is Dare. What is your name? I'm Chika. Hi, Chika. I really like your wristwatch. Very nice, great taste. [CHUCKLES] Thank you. How many I help you, please? I'm here to see Mo, Moduroti Bankole-Smith. Can you point me in the direction of her office? Any appointment, please? No. No, I don't have an appointment. But... You're a woman, you like surprises, right? - [CHUCKLES] - Yeah, this is a real surprise visit. - Will you? - Okay... Um, I'm just worried about my job. I'm not sure... Chika, you have nothing to worry about. I'm an old friend. And I guarantee you, you will not be in any sort of trouble. Oh, yes, she will. But you don't know what I want her to do. I don't need to know. Coming from you, it's trouble. I like your shoes. You should get some Loubs. Why are you here? Won't you ask me to sit down? I didn't invite you. Yet, here I am. How exactly did you find out where my office is? [EXHALES] Well, let's just say that your mom was a willing informant. Hmm. So, what do you want? I was curious to see what your office looked like. Not bad. Seriously? I know you're not that jobless that you came here just to see what my office looks like. Yeah, it means I have a lot of free time on my hands, but that doesn't mean that I'm jobless. [SIGHS] I'm a man on a mission. Which is? To get you to have that drink with me. [CHUCKLES] I already told you, the answer is no. Why? You're scared you will not be able to resist my charm, and then fall hopelessly in love with me? It won't be your first time. We were teenagers. - I would hardly call that love. - Uh-huh. It was just hormones. Infatuation, just a crush. - Anything but love. - Yes. Fine. Call it what you like. Think about that drink. See you soon. You're here early. Well, I was supposed to be meeting Jennifer for work, but she got bored and said she wanted to go out, and since we were supposed to be meeting here, I just figured, we all just come and you know... Wait, hang on, hang on, hang on... You mean, um... You mean Jennifer's here? Yeah, she's in the ladies. [SIGHS] Mo, man, we were supposed to meet here alone. I know, I'm sorry. [SCOFFS] You know how Jennifer is. I thought we were supposed to be meeting alone. Yeah, Tseju, I said we should meet, but not alone. Just sit. Well, you still could have said there'd be three of us, not two. Well, actually, four. Jennifer's here, too. What? Jennifer? [SIGHS] You know I can't stand that girl. I didn't know you were gonna be here. [GROANS] Well, you've officially been punked. - [CHUCKLES] - It's not funny. [LAUGHS] It is funny. You know, I'll tell you what's not funny. It's you girls not talking. So, you know what, we're all gonna sit here and have you both settle it out over drinks. And besides, we're sharing the bill. [BOTH] Why? [SNORTS] Well, consider it penance for keeping matters, yes? [CHUCKLING] Chief! Tseju. I'm sorry about the things I said. I just... I'm surprised you think so low of me. Tseju, I don't. I just want you to want more. You deserve more. You're beautiful and you deserve the world. Sorry. - Come here, I missed you. - I missed you. Aw, look at them! [LAUGHS] Winning. - Bring out your wallet. - Please go and get the drinks. [TOBE LAUGHING] I did it! Oh, my goodness. Is this not Tobe? Wow. You look good. [CHUCKLES] [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] Well, thanks. Hi, Jennifer. I remember the last time I saw you. You were just... You know. [LAUGHS] [TOBE CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] Well, thanks, um... You don't look bad, yourself. [CHUCKLES] Obviously. And, uh, congrats on the wedding. Aw, thank you. Bet you she does that to everybody. That's what she did the first time I saw her. - Oh, wow, this is beautiful, yeah. - [CHUCKLING] I know! It's just gorgeous. Honestly, if I wasn't already engaged, I'd probably consider taking you, too. What is he, a toy? Trust me, he's not interested. Ugh. Tseju, darling, I didn't even know you were there. Well, if you're losing your sight, you really should book an appointment with an optometrist. - Tseju! - Blind bat. Right. Blind, indeed. [CHUCKLES DRYLY] Ah, hey, Jennifer, so I... I hear your groom is coming to town. If he exists. Actually, he'll be here tomorrow. Yeah, and I can't wait to see him. - Why did you invite this over? - [JENNIFER] I've missed him so much! [LAUGHS] - It's beautiful! - [JENNIFER LAUGHS] I know! You're going to look so beautiful in your wedding dress. [CHUCKLES] I cannot wait. We're walking down the aisle. Everybody's eyes on me. [LAUGHS] I can imagine. [CHUCKLES] Every girl's fantasy. Yeah, well... I can't believe you're getting married! I'm gonna look amazing. [MO] Mmm-hmm. Oh! - Hey. - [CHUCKLES] I'm sorry. Traffic was crazy. Oh, that's okay. Oh, Mo, I want you to meet Iyke. The love of my life, and my husband-to-be. Nice to finally put a face to the name. - [ALL LAUGHING] - Same here. Now, the way Jennifer has been talking about you I feel like I've known you for ages. Really? Jennifer? Talk about someone else but herself? - [CLEARS THROAT] - [MO] That's a new one. [ALL CHUCKLING] And where's your best man? I assumed the both of you would come together just to get your measurements taken. Oh, yeah, he'll be here soon. I'm sure he's caught up in traffic. - [MO] Ah. - Yeah. Oh. There he is. [JENNIFER] Hi, Dare. - Jennifer. - [IYKE] My man. Glad you could make it. Thank you. You know Mo, don't you? Yeah. [LAUGHS] She's actually the event planner for the wedding, and she's been hounding me for days to set up this meeting. I remember Mo very well, actually. [CHUCKLES] Small world. - Too small, if you ask me. - [JENNIFER] Very, very small. Jennifer, uh, can I have a word with you? Just quickly. - I'll just be with her, two minutes. - Come on. Just... You'll get her back in two minutes, I promise. - Come on. - [BOTH CHUCKLE] Have you lost your mind? At what point were you planning on telling me that Dare Laguda is your husband's best man? Are you're gonna say you'd forgotten that we had history? [SCOFFS] I didn't think it was necessary. Besides, you and Dare broke up a hundred years ago. - So? - So, this is my wedding. Stop making it about you. Seriously? This is me making this about me? - Are you actually being serious right now? - Oh, my goodness. This is exactly why I didn't tell you. I need Mo, the calculated, organized event planner. Not some love-struck, whiny teenager. Listen. Mo, listen. Get a grip, yes? Otherwise, you are about to lose your job. Be wise. [EXHALES SHARPLY] So... [SIGHS] What was that about? Nothing. [CHUCKLES] Look. I was just as shocked as you were, you know. Seeing you here. But you don't see me grabbing people and pushing them into corners. Do you mind? I'm not in the mood. I... I don't understand why you're so upset. She could've told me. And then what? You'd have packed your bags and moved out of town? She didn't. Deal with it. Thanks a lot. [LINE RINGING] [PHONE RINGING] Hello? So, did you get my message? Yes. And I'm going to have Chika's head for giving you my key. Chika did not give me the key. She just made sure it was delivered to the right office. So... Would you go out on a date with me? I'll think about it. You know, I'm not very good at begging. Don't make me. Okay. Yes. So I'll pick you up at 8:00 p.m. Friday, fine? Okay, fine, bye. So? Get back to work. [IMITATING MO] Get back to work. - [WATER RUNNING] - [CELL PHONE RINGING] [WATER STOPS] Hello? [TOBE] Hello, babe, what's up? Hi, I'm good. How are you? Yeah, I'm good. I'm just, uh... I'm just heading home now. It's been a long day. You know, listen, I just wanna take a shower - and then I'll join you guys later. - Oh! Is today the last Friday of the month? [CHUCKLES] Oh, come on, look at you, man. I'm sure you didn't... You haven't spoken with Tseju all day, or else she would have reminded you. I actually haven't spoken to her today, and can't even make it. Why? What's going on? - Um, I have a date. - You have... ...a date? Mo, I thought you said you were done with that whole dating crap out there. Uh, dude... Wait, have you been watching my vlogs? Yes, I have. What date are you going out on again? Oh, are you serious? Wow. That's... I didn't expect that, - that's a bit of a shock. - [PHONE RINGING] Wait, Tobe, I'll have to call you later, my date's calling me. All right, I'll speak to you later. Bye! Mo... Hello? Hi. Yeah. All right, yeah, sure. Okay. I'll be waiting, yeah. Okay, then, see you soon. Bye. Hello? Tseju. Yeah... Hang on, hang on. Please, tell me you didn't know Mo had a date tonight. You... You did? Tseju, you... Goodnight, Tseju. What the hell is wrong with you, Tobe? Oh, well, good evening to you, too. Oh, please, I don't have time for any of your sarcastic crap right now. Why won't you just tell Mo exactly how you feel about her instead of taking out your frustration on us innocent bystanders? Tseju, what in heaven's name are you talking about? Don't do that. You know what I'm talking about. The whole universe knows exactly what I'm talking about. Except for Mo, who you won't tell how you feel about her. I don't understand. What? It's not that simple. But it is that simple. You just sit your friend down, you tell her how you feel, and you save her from this dating madness she's subjecting herself to. Well, thanks to you. I had nothing to do with it. She started it! Well, you helped. [SCOFFS] Look, just tell her. Look, Tseju, I've been telling Mo the same thing for the past months, now. But she never ever takes me seriously. Why should she take you seriously when you don't sound convincing enough? I mean, how convincing am I supposed to be? Huh? Give my life in exchange for hers as a ransom? Uh, yeah, if that's what it takes. [TSEJU] You... You... What exactly are you afraid of? Tseju, Mo and I have come a long way. I'm afraid things will change if... If we got together. [SIGHS] For goodness' sakes, Tobe, that's the whole point. Things aren't supposed to remain the same. You're supposed to go from being friends to being lovers, and eventually the Earth will go back to revolving around the sun again. Look, I don't care how you do it. You can put it in a song. Do something, just man up and tell her how you feel! [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING IN BACKGROUND] [MO] So, are you telling me that you actually hired out this whole restaurant just to take me to dinner? Yes. Why does that surprise you? It's quite a lot, just to try and impress me. So, are you impressed? - Maybe. - [CHUCKLES] Maybe. I'm just wondering how many other ladies you've done the same thing for. For all I know, you could have taken two ladies out this week. - [CHUCKLES] - Given them the same treatment. Made them feel special. This is about Sandra. [SIGHS] Yeah, this is about Sandra. Mo, haven't you forgiven me? Oh, I have forgiven. I just haven't forgotten. Mo, really, we were teenagers. These things happen. I mean, not like I'm making an excuse for it, but it wasn't like you were giving it up and hormones were raging. Do you know what? Let's just stop there. 'Cause this apology is even worse than the original one. So we'll just stop there before you dig any deeper. - All right, fine. - [CLEARS THROAT] Let's just start fresh. I'm sorry. Fine. But I will be ordering the most expensive thing on the menu. I'll be having lobster tonight. Please order for two. [CLICKS TONGUE] [BOTH CHUCKLE] - [DARE] Well... mmm. - [MO LAUGHS] [DARE] I don't even... [MO] Really? [DARE] I can't justify that, 'cause, yeah. [MO] I was highly offended, because that was so rude. And you could have bought better champagne. I don't drink just, you know, Brut. You know that I drink rosé, right? Just to let you know for next time. Well, our second date will be better, - guaranteed. - If I agree to go on one with you. [DARE LAUGHS, CLEARS THROAT] But yes, um... I had a great night. That means my charm still works. [CHUCKLES] Don't start. So... So, I will call you. Okay. Good night. Hey. [CAR DOOR OPENS] Good night. Good night. [CAR DOOR CLOSES] [HUMMING] So, I take it the date went well. Mum. Honey, she's here! Dad! - Yeah. - [MO SIGHS] Seriously, you two need to stop babysitting me. No, actually, it's... It's your mother. She insisted we wait up for you. She was curious. We were both curious. - So? - So what? How did it go? It was fine. What? You were humming. So? Then it has to be better than fine. Good night, Dad. Good night, Mum. [CONTINUES HUMMING] Oh, I think it went well! - I think so, too. - [CHUCKLES] Hi, guys! I know it's been a while and a lot has happened. I would like to introduce you to the new Mo. The happy Mo. The love-struck Mo, yes. I met a guy. Well, he's an old friend, but he's a whole new man. And he's thoughtful and charming and handsome. [LAUGHS] And he has a very big ego so I hope he doesn't see this. But yes. I think I'm in love. [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] Oh. [LINE RINGING] [MO] Hello? Hello? Mo! You finally picked up. I was beginning to think you dropped off the face of the planet, man. [MO] You know I've been busy planning Jenny's wedding. But I... I actually pinged you. Yeah, you said you were gonna call back, but you never did. I'm sorry. Look, everything has been so crazy. Like, she calls me every five minutes to get updates now that the wedding is just three weeks away. Like, I can't wait for it to be over - so I can get back to... - Hang on a second, Mo. We need to talk. What's going on? Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Everything's fine, it's just, uh... Hold on, hold on. Yeah, everything's fine, it's just, uh... Uh, I have a few important things I need to discuss with you, uh... I was wondering, are you free? Can you... Can you come over? Well, I was going to take a nap, before Jennifer bombards my phone with calls again, but okay. Yeah, sure, why not? Oh, yeah? Oh, cool, I'll be expecting you, then. Okay, but wait, wait. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, Mo, I'm fine. But just get here. All right, then. Okay. All right, bye. [SCOFFS] Man, Tobenna, man, how do you tell her this, man? [EXASPERATED SIGH] Listen here, Mo. It's me, it's me, Tobenna. I'm your guy, I've been trying to reach out to you for months now, but you hardly ever take notice. ♪ If you don't know me by now ♪ ♪ You will never, ever, ever know me ♪ ♪ In our li... ♪ [CHUCKLES] Man, that doesn't even sound convincing enough, man. [SIGHS] I mean, how do you tell a woman you love her? Mo... {an8}[SIGHS] Man, this is ridiculous. - [MO] Hi. - Hey, beautiful. Hello, handsome. [CHUCKLES] Finally, you admit. Please, don't let your head swell. It's a statement of fact, honey. Just happy that you finally see the light. [BOTH CHUCKLE] I want you to come over to my place. When? 'Cause I'm actually on my way out now. - Oh, oh, yeah? - Going to see a friend. Why, what's up? Uh, I thought you were supposed to be resting. Weren't you saying you're stressed? What can I do? When a friend needs you, you have to answer, right? Okay. So since you're running errands for friends, do you think you could possibly stop by my place first? Why? - It's a surprise. - Hmm? A surprise? Yes, and you need to get here fast. What, the surprise has and expiration time on it? Something like that. What kind of a surprise is that? Well, if I told you, it won't be a surprise now, would it? Just ask no more questions and get here quickly. [LAUGHS] Okay, but I have to leave early to go see my friend. Okay, cool. Um... What's going on? Won't you at least kiss me first? Will you tell me what's going on? Why are you outside? Well, I told you you had to hurry. - And I got here as soon as I could. - Okay. Get in the car. For what? The surprise. [STAMMERS] What's... What's the surprise? [SIGHS] Are we really going to do this now? Well, I'm not getting into a car if I don't know where I'm going. Fine. [CHUCKLES] Women. You've been complaining that you were stressed, so I decided to take you to SA for a few days. What? [LAUGHING] I can't. I can't just up and leave. Yes, you can. Get in the car. I can't! Jennifer's wedding is in, like, two weeks. And you have everything figured out. But what if something goes wrong, - and she can't reach me... - Mo. You're only going for the weekend, and if she needs to get you, she can talk to your boss directly. They both agreed. What? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. How did you do that? [SIGHS] Let's just say that, um... I have my way with people. They can't resist my charms. [LAUGHS] Oh, wait, my friend's calling me. - Oh, no. - No, no, no, no, no, wait, wait. I have to... No. Get in the car. [GRUMBLES] [MO] But I... I don't have any luggage. Don't worry about that. I have a MasterCard. It's all the luggage that you need. How did you even get my passport? My mum. And she was more than willing. - Mmm. - [CHUCKLES] Can we go now? You know, you're bossy. - Yes. - And arrogant. That, too, but you still love me that way. - Can we go now? - Whatever. [DARE CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] Man. How could you say unavailable? It just rang off right now. [KISSES TEETH] [LINE RINGS] [AUTOMATED VOICE] Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. At the tone, please record your message. When you have finished recording, you may hang up, or press one for more options. [BEEPS] [SIGHS] Will you at least calm down and sit down? You're making me nervous. Well, I'm just wondering what's taking so long. Look, I told you already, there's nothing wrong with Mo. How do you know that? She was supposed to show up at my place. She never did. I've been trying to reach her on the phone, - she's not... - Yes, yes, yes. You told me. Tseju, I don't even understand how you can be so calm - through all of this, eh? - Maybe it's because... I'm not the one who's in love with Mo. Besides, if there was anything wrong with her, you'd have heard them mourning from the gates. Then where the hell is she? [GRUNTS] Tseju. Good afternoon, ma'am. - Good afternoon, ma'am. - Oh! Tobe. Tseju. It's been a long time I've seen you both. - How are you? - We're fine, ma'am. Well, that's good. Uh, ma'am, is... Is... Is Mo okay? [TSEJU] Well, he... We wanted to... We tried to call her and we couldn't get through, so we wanted to make sure she's okay. Oh, well, of course she's okay. She's in South Africa having fun with Dare. - Oh! Oh. - [ANNA LAUGHS] Yes. She's didn't tell you two? Oh, well, he decided to surprise her with a trip. It was the most romantic thing. [STAMMERING] Uh, ma'am... Sorry, you don't mind I get something from the car? Oh. Sure. What time is she getting back, ma'am? This evening, or tomorrow morning. Okay, ma'am. Could you please tell her that we stopped by? She'll give us a call when she gets in? - Sure. I will. - Okay. Thank you. Is Tobe okay? Oh. [CHUCKLES] Thank you, ma'am. You're welcome, honey. [MO] No, I can't. Look, I'm swamped with work because of you. So I won't be seeing you anytime soon. [LAUGHS] Listen, don't worry. You will survive, okay? Look, I have to go. [LAUGHS] You're so naughty. All right, okay, I have to go, seriously. Okay. All right, then. Bye. Bye. That's Dare, I take it. Yes, and I can't believe it. Do you know what? It feels like a dream. - Apparently. - Where's Tobe? I thought he was meeting us here. - What? - Seriously? Did you think he'd show after the stunt you pulled? - What stunt? - [TSEJU] Really? What are you talking about? There's only so much a man can take, Mo. What are you talking about, Tseju? Are you seriously asking me that? Yes, what are you talking about? What's all this drama? Have you called Tobe since you got back? No, I've been busy. - With Dare. - [MO] No, actually, with work. Now are you going to tell me what's going on? [TSEJU] You were supposed to meet Tobe. At his house, remember that? [MO] Yeah. And then you just disappeared. No phone call, no text, nothing. The guy was worried out of his mind. Yeah, but I didn't plan it. Dare just came to my house. It was so unexpected. Was I gonna say no? What? I'm just surprised about you and Dare. You were dead-set against dating him in the first place. And then you changed your mind and I thought, "Okay, no harm can come of this," because you've dated before. But now things are moving so fast. Don't you think they're moving really fast? Slow down? [LAUGHS] Slow down for what? Listen, I've finally found a guy who's charming, handsome, and sweeps me off my feet. And the best part about it is I've known him for years. What am I slowing down for? Well, there is a reason you broke up in the first place. - [MO] Yes! - Remember that? And back then, he was a young man with raging hormones. Now, he's a mature man. Okay. I'm really not trying to pick a fight with you or criticize your decision. I'm just making an observation. Because I want you to be sure. I took your advice. And I don't want you to settle for less, either. I won't, trust me. Believe me, it's fine. - Yeah? - [MO] Yes! Okay, but you still have to call Tobe and apologize. - Yeah, yeah, I'll call him. - Fix it. I will, I will, I will. Right, tell me about your trip. - Oh, my God! - How'd it go? It was amazing. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Oh. Hi. What's up? What's up with you? I'm fine. Yeah, I can see that. I was worried. You weren't picking up my calls. You weren't returning my calls. I'm sorry, I've just been, uh, busy. You've been busy? What, too busy to call me back? Come on, Mo. There have been times when you couldn't take or return my calls, but I never made a fuss of it. The world doesn't have to revolve around you. You know that, yeah? What did I do? Clearly, you're angry with me and I don't know why. I'm not angry with you. Yes, you are. Look, we've been friends for a long time, Tobe. I know you. [CHUCKLES] No, you don't. Yes, I do. You don't, Mo. [MO] What's going on? You're my best friend. Therein lies the problem, Mo. What's that supposed to mean? Tell me, Mo, why are you here? [SCOFFS] I came here 'cause I missed you and I wanted to see you, but apparently... You know what? Forget it. I'm sorry I disturbed you. Mo... [TOBE SIGHS] - I'm sorry. - Why? Why am I sorry? No. Why are you angry? I'm not angry with you, Mo, it's just... It's just that you keep taking me for granted and I'm sick and tired of it already. I don't. See, you don't even know it, but you do. Well, I'm sorry. [TOBE] There. [MO] I... - I didn't mean to... - That's exactly what I don't want you to do. Be sorry. I want you to change, Mo. I want you to... I want you to stop seeing me as... As... I think the point I'm trying to make here, Mo, is I want you to start seeing me. I see you, Tobe. No, you don't. [SIGHS] I'm such a part of your life, I've melted into the background already. Listen, I don't know about any of this "melting into the background." But, it's because you are a part of my life. That's what makes you special. I can tell you absolutely any... Anything. It's not everyone that I can do that with so I don't understand what you're talk... [CELL PHONE RINGING] [TOBE] Don't pick it up. Mo, you just got here, don't pick it up. It's work. [CELL PHONE RINGING] Hello. What, right now? Okay, okay, I'm coming. I have to go. Can we talk about this later? I'll call you. [MO] But that wasn't what we agreed. No, no, no, no, no. You said the structure would be up by now. Listen, do you know what? I'm not even having this conversation over the phone anymore. Is your manager around? Is your manager around, yes or no? Okay, I'm going to come there now. I'm on my way over. I don't... No, no, no, no, no. I will see you in twenty minutes. Bye. Hello, Lanre. Yeah, so I was just speaking to the people, the... [SIGHS] They're just telling me stories. Honestly, I don't know what their problem is. They said the overflow structure isn't up yet and they can't do anything. All right. No, no, no, no, I'm going there... I'm going there now. I'm going to see their manager, so it's fine, I'll sort it out. Yes, yes, yes, all right. Okay, I'll see you soon, bye. Hi, Jennifer. Hi, how are you? I... Oh, I... I have it with me now. I have his tux. But it's in my car. Nothing will happen to it. [SIGHS] Okay, okay, if it makes you feel comfortable. I'll go and give it to him myself. Okay, I'll do that for you. I'll let you know when I've done it, okay? All right, bye, bye. [SIGHS] Oh, Jesus. Hello? Dare? The door was open. Dare? Dare? Hello? [GASPS] [DARE] Hey, Mo, Mo. Mo. - [MO SNIFFLING] - [DARE] Mo. [MO SOBBING] [DARE] Mo, it's not at all like that. Mo. Mo. [SOBBING] Don't touch me. [SNIFFLING] Mo. [SNIFFLES] I'm sorry for my unprofessional behavior. I knocked, but nobody opened the door. Mo, look, I can explain. See, what you saw... Was none of my business. I came... I came to drop this off. I need you to get it to Mr. Iyke. [MO SNIFFLING] The bride says... She needs it to get to him. Mo, look. That girl means nothing to me. It was purely physical, nothing more. What? It was just physical, it was nothing else. Mo... It was nothing, seriously. [MUTTERING] Physical... [MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY] Mo. It was what? It was just physical, it wasn't... Physical? It was purely physical. Look... Nothing more. Just... You know it's you that I love. [MO EXHALES DEEPLY] You can't say I haven't shown that love, you know this. [CHUCKLING] Mo. Come on. Goodbye, Mr. Dare. Mo. [SNIFFLING] [TOBE] Mo. [SOBBING] What's going on? It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Come on, talk to me, what's going on? - What happened, Mo? - [CRYING] He... I... It's okay, it's okay. Come on. [SOBBING] I was so shocked. And the worst... The worst part about it, was that he didn't think it was bad, because... Because he didn't have any feelings for her. Well maybe, that's because people like Dare just believe it's okay to treat a woman any how. And at the end of the day, just shower her with gifts and think that's enough to make the pain go away. I'm not that kind of woman. I don't want a man to shower me with gifts. No. I want a man who will respect me. Respect us. I want love. I want faithful love. I want true love. I want some... I want someone... Who truly gets you. Yes. Someone who genuinely cares about you. Who sees past your little faults. Someone who wants the best for you. Treats you as though you're the only woman in the whole world. Someone who would give his heart, his body and his soul. And love you with everything that he has ever, ever, ever had. [GASPS] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I can't do this. [ANNA] Mo? Honey, can I come in? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Can I come in? [MO EXHALES SHARPLY] Oh, honey, are you okay? I'm fine. [CHUCKLES] You sure? I'm fine, Mum. Dare cheating on me wasn't the worst thing in the world. Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. What for? You didn't do anything. Well, I encouraged it. I mean, I just thought you guys would be good together. So did I. Look, you have to face the rest of the world. You can't keep hiding. I'm not hiding, Mum. You haven't been to work in three days. Now, I don't know you to miss work. I just need some time to sort some things out. Okay. Tobe's downstairs waiting for you. I don't want to see him. This is the seventh time he is going to be here. Why are you avoiding him? [MO] I'm not. I'm not ready to see him yet. Well... You're gonna have to be ready sometime, honey. You can't keep hiding. Mum, I don't want to see Tobe. Oluwanimoduroti Bankole-Smith. It's complicated. How complicated can it be? We kissed. Oh honey, that's not complicated. That's interesting. Mum. What's so complicated about kissing him? He's my best friend. And it just felt... Unexpected. And confusing, and... And? Surprisingly good. [LAUGHING] And again I ask. Why is that so complicated? Tobe likes you. Of course he's liked me, Mum. He's my best friend. I don't mean it like that. I mean, he's always been in love with you. What? You didn't know? No. [ANNA] Oh, gosh, you had no idea. No! Mum, are you saying you've known all this time and you didn't tell me? Because I thought you knew, and you just didn't feel the same way. Look, sweetheart, with all that's happened, the question you need to ask yourself is, how do you really feel about him? That's... That's what I've been trying to figure out. You and Tobe have been friends for so many years. I've watched the two of you over the years, and I see the way he looks at you, how he cares for you. He adores you. And from everything that you've told me, there's obviously chemistry between the two of you. And if that isn't love, honey, I don't know what is. [LAUGHS] Mum. Are you saying that this is it? This... ...is what I've been looking for, and it's just been right there? I think so. [BOTH LAUGHING] Now, will you get dressed? And come downstairs and see him. I'll be down in five minutes. [ANNA LAUGHING] By the way, what's Tobe's last name? [MO] Okoronkwo. So you're going to go from Bankole-Smith to Okoronkwo. [BOTH LAUGHING] Get ready, honey. Love waits. Hi. Hi. [ANNA] Oh, will you get on with it, already? Mum, do you mind? [ANNA] Sorry. Just trying to help. [MO] I think we should... [TOBE] About the other day... [MO CHUCKLES] I was just going to say I think we should sit. But, what about the other day? I'm sorry I kissed you. You're sorry? Well yeah, because, uh... I reckon I kind of made you feel uncomfortable. I mean, you're my homie. Things don't have to be awkward between us. [SCOFFS] Things don't have to be awkward between us. [TOBE] Exactly. So, why don't we just pretend that kiss never happened, and just roll over and get back to the way things were? Okay. [CHUCKLING] Okay. I... I kind of liked it. And I thought you did, too. Oh yeah, I did, I did, I... I did, I... I do. I liked the kiss. [LAUGHING] So... So? Oluwa, I want to do it again. [CHUCKLING] And again. And all over again. [BOTH LAUGHING] A thousand dollars says your mom is watching us right now. Mum, you can go now. [BOTH LAUGHING] I love you, Mo. [MO] Isn't it funny how you can spend all your time chasing your own tail and looking for love in all the wrong places? When all that you've ever wanted, ever longed for, ever hoped for, is right here beside you? It's one week after Jennifer's wedding and thank God that it's over. The nightmare of having to look Dare in his arrogant, cheating face one more time is gone. And at least, one good thing came out of it. Tseju met someone. [INAUDIBLE]
