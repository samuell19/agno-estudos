The U.S. Embassy in Tehran has been invaded and occupied by Iranian students. The Americans inside have been taken prisoner and according to a student spokesman, will be held as hostages until the deposed shah is returned from the United States where he'’s receiving medical treatment for cancer. [shouting] While the Iranians burned an American flag in front of the embassy, they said the takeover had the express blessing of the Ayatollah Khomeini. My mother was very suspicious of the official stories about the Iranian hostage crisis and she became obsessed with the media coverage. She felt that important information was being lost as the story evolved. So she kept taping. Some 60 Americans, including our fellow citizen whom you just saw bound and blindfolded, are now beginning their sixth day of captivity inside the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Officials will continue their search for some way to negotiate the hostages'’ freedom. The story changed. A lot of the early reports indicated that there were, for example, CIA personnel among the hostages and then, suddenly, there weren'’t. You know, obviously, if you were running an intelligence agency it would be perfectly reasonable for them to suppress that information. But my mother was very conscious of that. Series of attempts to negotiate the release. She was saying, "Well, we'’ve got to get this. Nobody else is gonna keep this." This to restore military balance with the Soviet Union and... Her goal was trying to reveal a set of agendas on the part of governments. Soviet troops have swept into Afghanistan, dramatically changing the power game in the Persian Gulf. As much as it would like to, the United States can no longer encourage disintegration of authority in Iran in order to free the hostages. Day 59, January 1st, an angry mob of Afghan and Iranian demonstrators stormed the Soviet Embassy in Tehran. But this time, Khomeini'’s revolutionary guards evict the protestors. That same day, U.N. Secretary General Waldheim arrives in Tehran to negotiate the release of the hostages. She was kind of watching these positions and maneuverings, public opinion being molded. Kind of uniformly anti-Iran, people were calling for war. People were calling for all kinds of things. She felt that there was a lack of sympathy for the goals of the Iranian revolution. One analyst says, Khomeini so strongly detests the U.S. for its support of the Shah who was his lifetime enemy, but also because he considers Americans Satan'’s people and leaders of the decadent West. Outside the United States Embassy in Tehran, this morning the crowds, once again, took up their daily chanting and sign waving, especially for the television cameras. [chanting] During that crisis, she hit record and she never stopped. The Iran Crisis. America Held Hostage. America Held Hostage aired first for fifteen minutes, then for a half hour.

And then, something kind of amazing happens. It actually is watched by a lot of people. Good evening, some of the rhetoric coming out of Iran today was reminiscent ofthe early weeks of this crisis. There was a long running drama which had the capacity to change every day unpredictably, so it had a beautiful, dramatic structure. It had lots of unpredictable characters, many sub events. There has been a startling new development in the Iran hostage crisis. That U.S. attempt to launch a military rescue of the American hostages in Tehran has been, as you have now heard several times, aborted. Eight U.S. servicemen killed in the process. And it had this kind of agonizing pathos of being taken hostage. Not only were the Americans held in the embassy in Tehran hostage, but everybody else was a hostage, too.

Then she, she really, she really went into high gear. I recall there were times when there were eight recorders going at once. Those were special occasions. Normally, there were three to five tapes recording. People would say things, like, "Well, of course, the station'’s gonna keep everything."

But a month after 9/11 happened, I had written a note saying, you know, "If there'’s anything you need any help with, I'’d be happy to help you." Marion said, "There are some things we could use some help with." And what it was they needed helpwith was labeling videotapes. There was a wall of tapes and there were little stickies on them. CNN, a certain date and time, and they wanted actual labels put on them. [indistinct chatter] It just seems that she was more concerned about not losing any information about what was happening in the world. But that seemed to get in the way of having real contact or information about, um, her family. She collected between forty and fifty thousand books. She would buy them at every opportunity. She voraciously read them. I think she said she had nine apartments or homes. We were like packed to the gills. She was a hoarder. You know, she hoarded everything. You know, she got obsessed with the syrup containers that you get in diners, so we found like 50 of them or something. We weren'’t allowed to throw anything out. We kept them in bags, we called them burn bags and we would stick '’em throughout the apartments. She got different books that said, "My life is a mess" and different ones about how intelligent people are hoarders and, you know, live in disarray, you might say. [applauding] Hi, everybody. What do you think we would find if we went to your house with our television cameras and looked into your closet? - A mess, probably. - And she would buy stuff. And I would say, "Marion, where do you want me to put it?" And she would say, "Make room." It was almost like Marion'’s brain, these apartment rooms, and she knew where she would store stuff. Having all these magazines and books piled up around her, and tapes, and just walking through these little pathways was who she was. If you took away everything, you would take away Marion. [applauding] We'’re taking video tours through shopaholics'’ closets just to see what exactly they had hidden away. Here'’s one of our viewers. This one I love, and as soon as I get some place to wear it. This makes a statement. The difference between a hoarder and a collector is what value someone else finds in what they'’ve got. So if people come to a house and it... They think it'’s a pile of junk, then this person'’s a hoarder. If they think, "Oh my God, no one'’s ever kept this before?" Then suddenly, they'’re a collector. Well, you rarely see them in this good a shape. For example, the fingers are perfect. The bird is in mint condition. I'’d say, if this were to go to auction today, conservatively, it would be worth two in the bush. - Really? - It'’s just beautiful. Thank you so much for bringing it in. When you have a institution like a museum or a university and they begin to collect, you don'’t tend to question why they'’re doing it. There must be a rational reason. But when you'’re one lone person, and especially a woman, then you'’re considered to be an outlier.

Its membership is predominantly black, and while it describes itself as a back-to-nature movement, that may be an overly benign description of a group that has terrorized its neighbors and has a history of violence.

Martin Luther King said that because of television, it was going to be hard to maintain racism because television would show all. If you had things like Rodney King, then how could you not reform racism in the country? They can get it on videotape and we still can'’t get a conviction. Well, what happens to the policewhen they break the law? That question'’s back again because of Monday'’s beating of two people by sheriff'’s deputies from Riverside County, California. Granted the video doesn'’t tell you everything, but it sure looks like the deputies were using excessive force, and it sure looks like the Rodney King beating all over again. But isn'’t it a stretch to try to use this horrible incident as part of your, uh, your, uh, attemptto justify illegal immigration? We are more apt to be the victims of police brutality than any other group. Police use of deadly force against Hispanics has been a very significant problem.

Time and time again, these cases are cases of black, blue, and white. Black is the race of the people who are dead. Blue is the uniform who kill them, and white is the race of the people that let those killers go. But see, but that is the sort of race baiting. This is... there are two police officers... - That happens to be true. - There were five people here. Five police officers, two of them were African American. We went into a little bit of history'’s web of violence. And I just wonder and if this is related in any way to the whole acceptance of violence and killing as an everyday thing.
