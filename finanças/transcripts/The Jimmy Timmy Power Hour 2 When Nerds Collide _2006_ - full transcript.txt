(screen whooshes) - On my mark, Carl. Walk under the ladder now. (gentle playful music) - Looking good, Jimmy. No bad luck so far. (electricity crackling) (Carl screaming) - My skin smells funny. - [Cindy] See, Neutron? Your idea to have a Friday the 13th dance is already jinxing us. What were you thinking? - Tonight's dance will prove that bad luck is just a silly superstition. That lightning was just a coincidence. (electricity crackling) (Carl screaming) - Sheen, why is this step a different color than the others? - Oh, that one was broken, so I fixed it using one of Jimmy's old lightning rods. (electricity crackling) (Carl screaming) (Carl groaning) - [Libby] Come on, Carl, let's take you to the nurse. It's a lot safer there. - Uh, you know, Cindy, everyone's going to be taking, um, dates to this dance. - Oh, (giggles) right. Funny you mention that. Um, I kind of wanted to ask you something. - Oh, really? Me, too. I mean, I- (watch beeping) It's a priority alarm. Someone's robbing the Retroville Bank. It's Professor Calamitous! (Professor Calamitous laughs) - Neutron! - Sorry, Cindy, this is more important. - Oh, fine, it's not like I wanted to ask you to the dance or anything. You hear me? You may think you're the smartest kid in the entire universe, but I can do much, much better. - Turner, you have got to be the dumbest kid in the entire universe. Who the heck would come to a dance on Friday the 13th? It's all about bad luck. - It was the only day I had free. - (laughs) Friday the 13th is my birthday. Who would come to your dance when they'll all be coming to the surprise birthday party you've been planning and cleverly hiding from me? All the ladies in this universe will be at my party. Good luck finding a date. (giggles) Date! - Date? Oh, my gosh. I was so busy decorating I forgot to get a date for the dance. Oh, man, Crocker's right. No girl in this universe would date me. - Oh, my gosh. It's that boy who talks to inanimate objects. Just smile and back away slowly. - Wait a minute. Girl in this universe. - (giggles) He's so smart. You're so funny. I'll never forget you, Timmy Turner. Never. - Duh! I can't believe I forgot her. I've got to be the dumbest kid in the universe! Good thing Cindy Vortex doesn't know that. Guys, pack your bags. We're going to Retroville. - Ready when you are, amigos. Oh, wait, that's Mexico. (upbeat big band music) ♪ Timmy is an average kid that no one understands... ♪ (explosion booms) ♪ From here to the stars, fueled by Candy Bar's ♪ ♪ Rides a kid with a knack for invention ♪ (frog croaks) (audience laughing) ♪ It flips your lid when you're the kid with fairly odd ♪ ♪ With a super-powered mind, a mechanical canine ♪ (pig oinks) (audience laughing) (audience gasps) (tense dramatic music) (wand zaps) (ray gun zaps) (triumphant music) (audience cheering) (dramatic music) (cheerful music) (dark dramatic music) (thunder cracking) (playful music) (mouse chittering) (dark dramatic music) (guards snoring) - Oh, the shame of it. My fellow Anti-Fairies imprisoned on this, our most hallowed day, Friday the 13th. (cat yowls) Chin up, my beloved Anti-Wanda. Your savior, Anti-Cosmo, will have you all free presently. (mug clanging) - Hear that, Warden? We're breakin' out of here and t'aint nothin' you can do about it. (explosion booms) - Nobody is breaking out. You Anti-Fairies are always being chaotic, always trying to break the rules. You, prepare to join your friends in the Anti-Fairy hoosegow. - Never! (playful music) (Jorgen yells) - Spilled salt, oh, that is very bad luck. (Jorgen grunts) (Jorgen thuds) - I shall return, my dim beloved. This I swear. - (laughs) Dream on. I will buff up my security system. I will take away your ability to be invisible on Earth. (tense dramatic music) And I will make this prison impregnable to anyone in Fairy World or Dimmsdale or this universe. (prison tinkles) (dramatic music) - This universe? Hmm. Could this mean there are other universes? Oh, splendid. I smell a loophole. I smell a loophole! (laughs) (tense dramatic music) - [Calamitous] Working with a partner was my best idea ever, Dr. Moist. I'm so glad that we met at the Evil Scientist Expo. - Yes, between your robot suit and my paralyzing operatic high notes, that bank never knew what hit it. - Ah! You fool. You weren't watching the Neutron detector. Friendship over. (Dr. Moist wails) - So, I see you managed to escape the force field I trapped you in back in the Cretaceous Period. - Yes, and I had a long time to contemplate my revenge, Neutron. - Get a life. - Ah! (Jimmy grunts) (dramatic music) Who needs a partner? I'm gonna finish you off all on my own. - Not if I can stick you with an anti-gravity disc first. - What? No! I'll get you, Neutron. - Well, that's done. Now to get back to Cindy. - Jimmy, we came to help you fight Professor Calamitous. - Yeah, the doctor says I'm okay. The electricity passed harmlessly through my spine. - [Jimmy] No, if you'll excuse me, I need to ask Cindy something. - [Carl] No problem. - [Sheen] Whatever, Holmes. (mystical music) - We made it. We're in Retroville. - Oh, dear. This universe makes my hips look fat. - What universe doesn't? - It's Neutron. Disguise yourselves. - Timmy? Timmy Turner? How did you get back into our dimension? - Oh, hey. Well, I, uh, used my techno-geektoid wristwatch to warp here and stuff. - Hola, Fudgehead. (speaks muffledly) - [Carl And Sheen] Small-headed Jimmy! - Guys, his name's Timmy. - [Carl And Sheen] Small-headed Timmy! - What up, Small Headster? - How are ya, Big Teethster? - Hey, I bet you guys know where Cindy lives. - Cindy? What do you want with Cindy? - Oh, I'm here to ask her to my Friday the 13th dance tonight. - Your Friday the 13th dance? - [Carl] We can show you. - But only if you promise to get us there in an unsafe and irresponsible fashion. - Well, I, uh, wish I could do that. Maybe if I go behind this tree. (playful music) (upbeat music) Later, dude. (Carl and Sheen wailing) - Cindy would never go to a dance with a lunkhead like Timmy, unless he fooled her into thinking he's really smart and really funny. - (giggles) He's so smart. You're so funny. - No! - Then Neutron just flies off, leaving me there. Not that I wanted to go to the dance with him. - Well, who are you going with? You think a date's just gonna come crashing through the ceiling? (Timmy, Carl, and Sheen yelling) - Hi. Remember me? - I must use this power for good. - Timmy Turner? Oh, of course. How could I forget someone with your charm and mental acumen? - (chuckles) You still talk funny. - Awesome ride, Timmy. - Yeah, I got hit in the head, but okay me am, I think now. - Uh, guys, could you give me a second? I need to ask Cindy something very important. - You came all the way from your universe just to ask me something? Now, that's what I call panache. - Huh! They do speak Spanish here. - Silencio, estupido. - So, uh, here goes. Cindy, would you like to- - Wait! (Jimmy crashes) Cindy, before you say anything, there's something you have to know about Timmy. - Back off, Fudgehead. You're cramping my style. - Sorry, Timmy, but somebody's gotta tell her you're not a genius. - What? Oh, of course he is. How do you think he got here, magic? (both laughing) - Magic? - Cindy, He's just pretending he's a genius so you'll go to his Friday the 13th dance with him tonight. - (gasps) Timmy, that's so flattering. - Really? Well, my humongous genius brain figured you'd feel that way. - Cindy, this is all an incredible confabulation. - I've had enough of you, Mr. Big-Word-Using Guy. You heard the lady, I am so a genius. - Oh, yeah? Prove it. (Jimmy yells) - There, how do you like my quantum boxing-glove-gadget thing that I just invented? - That's it, tiny brain. It's go time. - Oh, yeah? Bring it on. (tense music) - Nerd fight. Nerd fight. - Wow, Timmy's amazing. He invents stuff so fast, you can't even see him do it. - Cindy, are you really gonna let those two guys fight over you? - Um, (giggles) I thought I might. - Girl, you are my hero. - Okay, Turner, if you're a genius, try and counteract my freeze ray. (freeze ray zaps) - Ha! (Wanda and Cosmo shivering) - Yay, Small-headed Timmy! - Oh, but we still like you, too, big-headed Jimmy. - Now, face the power of my... I wish I had a burp cannon. Burp cannon! (Libby and Cindy gasp) (cannon gurgling) (cannon belching) (Jimmy wails) - Thanks, Goddard. (Goddard barks) Time to expose this faker once and for all. (upbeat music) - I wish I had a cool rocket like Neutron's. Uh, that I will now invent behind this tree. (mystical music) (upbeat music) Looking for me? - Is there a movie on this flight? - Yes, and it's called "Don't Let Jimmy Hear You." - Oh, I love Westerns. - Well, back to the resumes. Finding a good collaborator is my only chance of defeating Neutron. "Can also do light housework." Hmm... (detector buzzing) My Neutron detector. He's on the move again. - [Timmy] Watch it, Brain Boy, pick a lane. - [Jimmy] Bring it on! - What's this? Someone else fighting Neutron? And beating him, by the look of it. - How does he keep building stuff so fast? - Hi, Fudgehead. - Quiet. We're in disguise. I mean, tick, tick, tick, tick. It's over, isn't it? - Your reality-bending computer programs, of course! That's how you're doing all this. - So what? You've got your stupid science stuff, and I've got Cosmo and Wanda. - Um, can I just say one thing? - Sure. - Mountain! (all screaming) (dramatic music) (Jimmy wailing) - Well, that's settled. - Timmy. - Oh, all right. I wish this button would save Jimmy. (button chirps) - Do we need to tell anyone about this? (Jimmy yells) (Jimmy grunts) - In your face, Neutron. I out-geniused you and saved your butt. - Incredible, that small boy defeated Neutron with his tiny flying helpers. I must find out where he got them. - Neutron, you boob! You almost got Timmy killed. - Cindy, Timmy's not a genius. - Oh, please. You're just jealous 'cause he's way smarter than you. - Yeah. What she said. Cindy, why don't we go someplace where we can talk about tonight's dance? Say, my dimension? - (giggles) I'd love to. Bye, Nerdtron. - Have fun dancing with Sheen. - Cindy, wait! Goddard, I'm going to Dimmsdale. - And so am I. (cackles) (cell phone ringing) What? Oh, the position's filled. (cackling) (playful menacing music) (light music) - Hey, Jimmy, I don't know what this stuff does, but here. - Thinks he can just open up a dimensional wormhole, sweep Cindy off her feet, and then poof them both back to his universe? - Yes, go on, Neutron, open that portal so I can learn the secret of that big-toothed child's floating collaborators. (portal whirring) - Done, now if you'll excuse me, it's time to save Cindy from the horrors of a dumb dance date. - Yo, I told you I'm coming, too. Cindy's my girl. - And we have no lives, so count us in. - Okay, okay, just hurry. We're running out of time. (triumphant music) - Neutron's lab, it's open. Well, maybe just a little peek. (all screaming) - Whoa! Look at me! I'm totally flat. And you, my dear... - Oh, don't even go there. - So, where do you think Timmy and Cindy are, Jimmy? - Don't know. We'll have to split up. Be careful, this Turner's a wily one. (horses whinnying) (whimsical music) - Having a good time, my transdimensional sweet? - I can't believe we're flying on an actual Pegasus. - (chuckles) Actually, Cindy, the term is winged horsey. - (giggles) And I can't believe you found the dress of my dreams, with tiara and shoes to match. And I really can't believe your parents are billionaire supermodels. (regal music) (jazzy upbeat music) (shutters clicking) This day has been so perfect, it's as if somebody somehow got a hold of my diary and wished every one of my secret dreams came true. - Yeah. (chuckles) What are the odds? I wish this thing was back where you found it. (triumphant music) - Oh, Timmy, this is the most magical day of my life. Do you know what would make it even more magical? - Uh, you agreeing to be my date to tonight's Friday the 13th dance? - I might go, if you show me your lab. - Huh? - [Both] Huh? - Your lab, where you make all your inventions. Neutron never wants me in his lab, but you're not like him, are you? - Ha. Not in the slightest. I wish- - No. Not another word. I don't want anything to spoil this moment. Don't say anything until I see your steamy den of scientific discovery. - Sorry about this, dude. (button beeps) (AJ screams) (triumphant music) (components whirring) Welcome to my lab. Can we go now? (Cindy squealing) Beakers, centrifuges, test tubes, and a cloning tank? Who is that? - I'm, uh, building the perfect bald kid? - And you have a gene splicer? - (chuckles) Uh, sure. - Timmy, I'm ready. You can ask me to your dance now. - Cindy, I- - Oh, but not here. Someplace romantic. Someplace I'll always remember. - Okay, I wish... - Shush, and not another word until we get there. I wanna cherish this moment. - I know just the place. (mystical music) (Calamitous wailing) - (cackles) I made it. Good going, Calamitous. Now, there must be something in Neutron's Infinite Storage Cube that can help me find that big-toothed boy's flying helpers. (plant roars) (cheerful music) (doorbell rings) - Hi, Mr. Turner, I'm looking for- - (laughs) Another reality avoidance costume, eh, Timmy? Oops, I mean, Buzz Adams. Looks like someone's date was a disaster. - What? Date? - You know what else is a disaster? The toilets. Get to work, Buzz. - Hey, this wig you're using to hide your shame makes a great handle. (soaring romantic music) - Ah, this is nice. Cindy, would you, would you... - [Carl] Hi, Small-headed Timmy. - Hi, Normal-headed Cindy. - Carl? Sheen? What are you guys doing here? - Jimmy brought us. He's trying to find you. - He is? - Uh, look out for that sand storm coming towards just you two guys, that I just wished for. (wind whooshing) (Carl and Sheen yelling) (soaring romantic music) - Cindy, I- - [Libby] Yo, Cindy! - [Cindy] Libby? - Did he ask you yet? What I miss? Tell me everything, girl. - Uh, uh, hey! Is that a famous hip-hop star? - Where? Is it Lady La-Dee-Dah? - Uh, sure. I wish. (upbeat hip-hop music) (Libby squeals) (fingers snap) - Okay, one more time. Here we go. Cindy, will you- - Small-headed Timmy! - Here, Small-headed Timmy. (clicks tongue) - Here, boy. - (groans) Would you excuse me for a sec? Do you mind? You guys are totally cramping my style, which I now have in my own universe with this one girl. - Yeah, well, that one girl is my best friend, and I ain't going anywhere until I know she's happy. - And Libby is my girl, and I'm not going anywhere until she's happy. Or unless Ultra-Lord's involved in some way, shape or form. - And I just wanna see what llamas look like in this universe. - Look, what if I gave you guys my pink and green fair, uh, reality-bending computer programs to play with? - I don't, okay. - Works for me. - All right, but if Neutron was right and you break Cindy's heart, reality isn't all that's gonna get bent around here, get it? - Got it. Cosmo, Wanda, I wish you would do whatever these guys tell you to do. - Because that wish always works great. - Take us where the llamas are! - Finally, a llama wish. (triumphant music) - I can't believe I'm scrubbing stupid Timmy Turner's stupid toilet with a stupid toothbrush. Finished! - Man, those high-fiber energy bars we supermodels eat zip right through you. - You're going to need this. - No! - Yay! I'm the Llama King. Come, my loyal subjects. Whee! (llamas grunting) - Now give me giant feet. No, no, I know. Give me a TV for a head. No, no, no, I know. Make me best friends with Morgan Freeman. Now we're getting somewhere. (upbeat hip-hop music) - (shudders) I may never brush my teeth again. Maybe that's how Turner's teeth got that way. (menacing music) - It's Neutron. Who needs tiny collaborators when I can just dispatch Neutron myself with one of his own weapons? Hmm, this looks suitable. (device whirring) (device beeping) What? (yells) - Never be clean, never be clean. (Calamitous yelling) Professor Calamitous? (dramatic music) My Hyper-Cube? To Do List. One, travel to parallel universe. Two, capture Big Tooth's flying helpers. Three, destroy Neutron. So he's after Turner's computer program. - Son, I'm having another high-fiber energy bar. (Jimmy screaming) (Calamitous yelling) (cats yowling) (Anti-Cosmo sniffing) - I say, somebody is cooking up a delicious stew of bad luck. (cat yowls) - Sweet muffins. I never had this much bad luck in my universe. - My universe? Wait a moment, are you from another universe? - (gasps) You're, you're one of those tiny flying creatures. You can help me destroy my nemesis, Jimmy Neutron. - Of course. I'd be happy to help with whatever it is you're blathering on about, provided you do me one teensy favor. - At last, complete and total lockdown. (locks chiming) The ultimate defense against fairies, Anti-Fairies and even the occasional gnome. Nothing of this universe can get in or out. - Hello, my good man. - Oh, hello. Hey! - This the emergency release button? - You bet. (siren blaring) - I will never allow you to escape. (Anti-Fairies clamoring) - Well, your friends are free. Now you help me defeat Neutron. - Yes, about that... (Jorgen snoring) (gate clangs) - I thought you were going to be my collaborator. You lied to me. - Yes, I do that from time to time. It's almost like I'm evil. Well, ta. - Ready, Cindy? - Ready, Timmy. - Cue the swans. (swelling romantic music) - [Jimmy] Wait! - Huh? Neutron, you are here. - Cindy, listen to me. Calamitous followed me here and he's trying to use Turner's floating computer programs for evil. - Oh, please. Like anything bad's gonna happen on my watch. (thunder booming) (menacing dramatic music) - Oh, no! A wormhole is opening up. (Anti-Fairies clamoring) - Howdy, y'all. - Oh, yes, howdy, indeed. We're free. Free! Now I can send my Anti-Fairies out to halt the Earth's rotation. Tomorrow will never come, making every day Friday the 13th. - Um, why would you tell us that? - Because I know you can't stop me, fool. (cackles) - (laughs) He called you fool. - Do you always have to get the last word? - Yes. (menacing dramatic music) - Timmy, you said there was nothing to worry about. - Who's worried? I'm not worried. Do I look worried? - You should be. The sky is filling with your evil computer programs. - Mine? - Yes, yours. And now, let's pause a moment as I perform the in-your-face dance. ♪ In your face, in your face ♪ ♪ In your face, uh-huh, in your face ♪ - Oh, I wouldn't be dancing in his face if I were you. Soon, every day will be Friday the 13th and bad luck will rain down upon you in perpetuity. And it's all thanks to you and your friend Calamitous. - Yeah, way to go, Nerdtron. - Oh, and thank you, Timothy, by luring him up here by showing off Cosmo and Wanda. Ta. ♪ In your face, in your face ♪ ♪ In your face ♪ - (chuckles) Look, don't worry, I've dealt with these guys before. We can stop them, but we'll need Cosmo and Wanda. - But you lent them to Carl, Sheen and Libby. Well, they could be anywhere. - All right, Calamitous, I agree. We will team up in order to escape. I will now use your puny, other-worldly body to bash my way out of this cell. (head thuds) But I can't break free. (head thudding) - Can I just say something? - What? He left the keys in the door. (Calamitous groans) - Nice job. (triumphant music) - Neutron, what is that thing? - It's a sound wave detector. All we have to do is find the funkiest beat in a 100-mile radius and we'll find Libby. Cosmo and Wanda should be with her, Carl, and Sheen. - Well, that's brilliant, Neutron. - Thanks, but I don't hear anything yet. - Well, maybe it's being drowned out by the sound of you patting yourself on the back. (Cindy giggles) (tense music) - Anti-ladies and anti-gentlemen, lend me your anti-ears. It is time for the master plan. You, get out there and cause as much bad luck as possible. (Anti-Fairies cheering) While you take to the skies. Circle the globe at hypersonic speeds to stop its rotation. (Anti-Fairies clamoring) Once you succeed in slowing the rotation of the Earth, time will stand still. Tomorrow will never come. It will be Friday the 13th every day and bad luck will reign forever. (frenzied dramatic music) - Cock-a-doodle... (wistful music) (frenzied dramatic music) (sound wave detector beeping) - You boys are awfully quiet. - Well, undoing all the trouble he's caused takes concentration. - Hey, you're the one this Calamitous guy followed here. If you weren't jealous of me and Cindy... - Hey, you knew I liked Cindy and tried to steal her from me. (detector beeping) - Guys, wait! I hear something. (dramatic music) - There they are! Libby! - [Jimmy] Carl, Sheen! - [Timmy] Cosmo, Wanda! - Herbert Noodleman. What? Everyone else got to say a name. - So much llama love. - So much funk. - Come on, Sheen. These lines aren't gonna memorize themselves. - So much Morgan. - Oh, no, they're suffering wish-overload. Libby, you've gotta wish Cosmo and Wanda back to me. - Why you? I'm the genius here. - Look, brain boy, they're my programs and I know how to make them work. Listen, Cindy, I know some of this is my fault, even though most of it is Neutron's, but all I ever wanted was to take you to the dance. - These boys are still fighting over you? - Oh, (giggles) are they? I hadn't noticed. Go ahead, give Timmy his programs back. - I wish Timmy had Cosmo and Wanda back. - I wish that every wish Carl, Sheen and Libby made didn't happen, and they were all back their old selves. (uplifting music) - Yes, Roxanne, I am leaving you. - I can't go on. (upbeat hip-hop music) - Cosmo, Wanda, quick! I wish the Anti-Fairies were gone. - Goodbye, anti-jerks. There's too many Anti-Fairies. They're interfering with our wands. - Well, you're the genius here. What do you wanna do? - Crocker's lab! Uh, I mean, my other lab. Cosmo, Wanda? - Anti-fairies. I will stop them with my mighty magic wand. Or not. Plan B, hide! (Calamitous yells) (Anti-Fairies laughing) (all yelling) (Timmy screams) - Guys. (Cosmo and Wanda yell) Welcome to my other lab. - This isn't your lab. - Yes, it is. - Then why are there pictures of your teacher everywhere? (lively music) - Because I love to learn? - Does that explain that picture of you with a dart in it, and that sign that says "I hate Timmy"? - Uh, I have low self-esteem? - Me, too! - [Cindy] Ow! - No. No. (items crashing) No. - What are you looking for, Timmy? - Aha! - [Both] (scream) A butterfly net! - [Both] A butterfly net? - If it has wings and flies, a butterfly net can catch it. - Really? Hmm. Aha. (triumphant music) If I can combine this butterfly net with my Hyper-Cube, I might be able to suck all those rogue computer programs into it. - I just remembered. I don't have low self-esteem, I have low blood sugar. - And voila. (curious music) (net whirs) (Cosmo and Wanda wailing) - Watch it, Fudgehead. - Good idea, Neutron. - Uh, I'll stand over here and make sure Cindy's okay. You okay? - (giggles) Uh-huh. - Good work, Timmy. - Now, come on. Let's go kick some butt. (triumphant music) (playful music) (Crocker snoring) - What's that? Must have been dreaming about fairies. I've got you cornered, Turner. No, Mother, not the tiny pants! (lively jazz music) (mother screams) (cat meows) (safe whistling) (man screams) (safe thuds) (ground rumbling) (mug clattering) (ship horn blows) (woman screaming) - Bad luck amuck. I'm Chet Ubetcha saying it's Friday the 13th in Dimmsdale and I can't change the calendar. - Okay, here's the plan. We need to get all the Anti-Fairies in one place so Neutron can suck them up, got it? - Uh-huh. - Uh-huh. - You bet. - You bet. - [Both] There's a plan? - Operation Anti-Bad Luck is now in effect. (Calamitous wails) (Jorgen yells) - You'll never get away, and there's nothing you can do to distract us. (glass shatters) - Ah, we need to break more mirrors. Sheen, give me a high C. Okay, here's a L over high C. ♪ La ♪ (glass shatters) (triumphant music) (Anti-Cosmo sniffs) - (laughs) It's a bad-luck buffet. - Look, I'm running under a hundred ladders. - Yes. Yes, lovely. (cats meowing) Marvelous. I cannot resist the siren call of your delicious bad luck. - Now to really ramp it up. (dramatic anticipatory music) (triumphant music) (glass shattering) - Wow, look at all that bad luck. - Oh, I can't resist it. (tense dramatic music) (weight thuds) (cats meowing) (Anti-Fairies chattering excitedly) (energetic dramatic music) (salt shakers clanging) - (laughs) Yes, yes. Spilling salt, the tastiest bad luck of all. (slurps) What? Get back, back. You're supposed to be halting the Earth's rotation. (triumphant music) - Cock-a-doodle do! (glass shattering) (Anti-Fairies clamoring) (triumphant music) (remote beeps) (Hyper-Cube whirring) (remote beeps) (energy crackling) (Anti-Fairies screaming) (Anti-Cosmo wailing) - Bad luck, old chap. - Nay. Nay, I say! Oh, we were so close. So close. (remote beeps) (wails) Oh, rat poopy. - [Both] All right! You rock, dude. - Well, now that that earth-shattering crisis is over, back to business. Oh, boys... Nice work, guys. You both did a great job. - (scoffs) Him? It was my net that saved us. - No, Cindy, it was my Hyper-Cube. - I'm Cindy's hero. - No, I'm Cindy's hero. (both yelling) - Cool, when we get back home, can we get them to do our homework? (girls giggling) (dramatic music) - Ah. The Infinite Storage Cube. With that much harnessed energy, I'd be invincible. - Negative. Those Anti-Fairies are going back to jail. (button beeps) (jet pack whooshes) (tense dramatic music) (Jimmy and Timmy yelling) - Calamitous! I can't let him get the Hyper-Cube. - And I can't let Neutron look good. I'll stop them with this. - Timmy, no! That's your gene splicer. (gene splicer zaps) (both shouting) - What, what is happening here? - We have been fused together. - Must maintain dominance. - Not a chance. My mind, stronger than you. (dramatic music) - He's big. - He's mean. - Ugh, he's gross. (menacing playful music) - Where's he gonna buy shirts? - Finally, an all-powerful collaborator of my very own. With my genius and your power, I'll be invincible. - If I could move my arms, I would so totally beat you up right now. - You mean like this? (Jorgen groans) Why are you hitting yourself? (Jorgen groans) Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? - Can't move of my own will. (grunts) - Because my will's in charge. And now for my first trick. - Cindy! - Watch out! I saved her. - No, I did. (explosion booms) - Jimmy! Timmy! (both laughing) - Wait, I should not be laughing. This is a terrible situation. And yet, (laughs) I find myself unable to resist your, your influence. (laughs) I will get you for this. (both laughing) - Jimmy, Timmy! The only boys who ever fought over me and they're gone. - Hey, let go of her! - Do not worry, little girl. It is against the rules to use magic to- - Silence. Sorry, girlie, I can't have you avenging your boyfriends' demises. You're coming with me to Retroville. (Cindy screams) - Cindy! - Jimmy! - Small-headed Timmy! - Milton Bimowitz! What? He's the king of vaudeville, and he plays the spoons. Can you play the spoons? - Oh, joy. Having a magic partner in crime has allowed me to finish almost every item on my new to-do list. I've terrorized the inhabitants with prehistoric creatures, (people screaming) (dinosaur roars) imprisoned Jimmy's loved ones in carbonite, and prepared a delicious picnic lunch to nourish my strapping new body. - This sandwich is unacceptable. Sourdough is the lowest form of bread. - You'll eat it and you'll like it. - (grunts) This indignity will be avenged. Mm, spicy mustard. - My two favorite people are gone, and now you're probably gonna get rid of me. - Oh, a gentleman would never harm a lady. Besides, I need to keep an eye on you while I complete my greatest plan of all. (energy zaps) (menacing dramatic music) Behold my big bang bomb, with shockwaves so powerful, they'll tear the very fabric of time. The Earth will revert to its original state, allowing me to remake it in my own glorious image. (Calamitous cackles) - You madman. Could you please pass the pickle relish? - Oh, no. Our old best friend and our new best friend, both gone. - They'd barely begun to hate each other. (somber music) - We're doomed! Calamitous is mega-powerful and the only two people who could stop him are toast. Why? (crying) (all crying) - Actually, we're snails. - But the French eat us with toast. (Libby shrieks) - Timmy, Jimmy. Jorgen's magic didn't destroy you, it just turned you into cute little snails. - Cool, I wanna feed them. Who's got some snail biscuits? - Guys, Calamitous took Cindy to Retroville. We've got to save her. - This is all our fault, Turner. Our stupid competition has endangered the life of the woman we think is sort of cool. - (chuckles) Yeah, you know, for a girl. - Pathetic. - Then it's settled. We've got to put aside our differences and join forces to save her. - Let's shake on it. - Uh, eye-five. (eyes slap) (both yell) (triumphant music) - Gather round, everyone. I have a plan. - Activate particle accelerators. Reset expansion sequence. Charge the detonator with unlimited power. (computer beeping) (menacing music) Excellent. Here's a cookie. (Jorgen chomps) - You're insane, Calamitous. You'll be destroyed, too. - No, I'll be hiding under that magical desk. Sorry there's no room for you. - B-but, you said you don't harm girls. - Quite right. Jorgen, turn her into a goldfish. (Cindy screams) - Sorry, blonde girl. The merger made him the boss of my body. I am so ashamed. - Arming highly suspenseful detonation timer now. (computer whirring) (tense dramatic music) - Hey, stop, insane, evil human. You must reconsider, or at least come closer so I can bite you. (chomps) - Too late. Nothing can stop me from finishing my greatest plan of all. (Calamitous cackles) (Jorgen yells) - Fairy Force Five, attack! - You. - Here's for hurting our friends, chump. (Jorgen and Calamitous scream) - A tractor beam. I guess that's the best you can do now that Neutron and Overbite Boy are gone. - But, Professor, I keep trying to tell you- - Silence. We've got to turn their own energy against them. (dramatic music) (playful music) (all screaming) - Good idea having your friends make us invisible for our reentry, Turner. - That's what Timmy brings to the party. Now, where's Cindy? The others can't hold that creep off forever. - My readings indicate she's at the top of the structure. (energy whirring) Take my hand, Turner. - I'm kind of afraid of intimacy. - Come on. (Timmy wails) (energetic dramatic music) - (gasps) Jimmy, Timmy, you're alive. - Cindy? You're a fish? - I can't dance with a fish. I mean, that fiend! - Calamitous wants to blow up the universe. You've got to defuse this bomb. - Incredible. A working quantum nullification device. If I can just identify this energy matrix- - Better let Timmy do it. He's more familiar with the systematology, right, Timmy? - Uh, define systematology, and familiar and more. - Cindy, I'm telling you for the last time. Timmy's got the brains of a four-day-old melted pudding pop. - Hey, I'm tired of you trying to make me look bad in front of her. You think you're so smart? Well, anybody can press buttons, see? (machine rumbling) Whoa! In hindsight, buttons aren't always the way to go. (kids screaming) - Jimmy and Beaver Boy? But I destroyed them. (tense dramatic music) (all screaming) (bright upbeat music) - Attention, passengers. We're beginning our descent into the town of Retroville. - We know you have a lot of choices out there, so thank you for flying Air Idiot. - How can they still be alive? - I've been trying to tell you. My magic can't be used to destroy people because it is against the rules. (tense dramatic music) - [All] Whoa! - [Calamitous] Now to finish you off once and for all. - Hello, Mr. Poor Listening Skills. The rules forbid it. - I am your tiny master. Obey me. - No. No! - You will. - Jorgen's able to resist Calamitous's demands when they make him mad. - That's great. So all we have to do is keep Jorgen angry. Summon your computer programs. Call your friends. - Cosmo, Wanda! I need you to create the craziest, most illogical magic you can. Enough to make Jorgen furious. - You will. You will. - No. No. - I don't know, sweetie. I'm just not much of a loose cannon. - I am! But where will we find someone as dangerously off-kilter as me? - Dance, Tito, dance. (uplifting music) Now and forever, I am Fairy Boy! - Do you feel illogical, punk? Well, do you? - I was born illogical. Ask the doctor. - You will. You will. - No. No! Maybe. No. - Turn, villain, and face your worst nightmare. - Yeah, an idiot and a bigger idiot, and me. Wait, I counted me twice. - Make a move, I dare you. With my new powers, I'm invincible. (upbeat music) ♪ I'm ridin' a hot dog over you ♪ ♪ All these pork by-products have got me feeling blue ♪ - What? Hot dogs do not fly or spit fire. That is illogical and it makes me very angry. (all yell) - I'm me again. - It's working. - Jorgen, pay attention. - Ow. Ow. (hand slaps) - Just making him mad isn't enough to break him free. We have to do the one thing he can't stand. - Which is? - We have to violate the rules. (energetic upbeat music) - And action! - I wish Carl would fall in love with that turkey. (turkey gobbles) - Oh, turkey, I am suddenly filled with love for you. - What? You cannot use fairy power to make people fall in love, especially with poultry. - You had me at (gobbles). (Carl kissing) - Go again, Timmy. - I wish Cosmo could beat Sheen at rock, paper, scissors. - [Sheen And Cosmo] Once, twice, shoot. - Yay, I win. Thanks, magic. (kisses) - [Sheen And Cosmo] Once, twice, shoot. - (flatly) Oh, darn, you won with magic again. - [Sheen And Cosmo] Once, twice, shoot. - No! You cannot use magic to win a competition, even a ridiculous one like that. - Focus, you muscle- bound imbecile. - Yay, I win again. - Do it, Neutron. We have to break the biggest rule of them all. - I've been waiting all day to say this. I wish Timmy Turner was gone. - (screams) My spleen! Good-bye, cruel, bulgy world. (Jorgen gasps) - No! He's gone, gone. (crying) - [Jorgen] No! - Obey me, fool. Obey me! - You have broken the most sacred of all the fairy rules. How? How? - Quick, while he's free of Calamitous's control. - Neutron, catch! - Sorry to split up such a close relationship. (gene splicer beeping) (Jorgen and Calamitous shouting) - It's not fair. I finally had it all planned out. (footsteps thudding) - Puny human, you have subjected me to the ultimate indignity. Plus, the whole time, your breath smelled like fish tacos. - I can explain. (Calamitous wails) - Guys, you did it! That was awesome. - Oh, don't be modest, Timmy. After all, you deactivated the bomb. - The bomb? (tense music) (timer ticking) (Timmy screams) (both scream) (explosion booms) - (chuckles) My incredible powers are back under my control. I have made everything as it was before. - Is this the end of Fairy Boy? - For now. But if we ever need a sub, we'll call. - That was the most reckless I've ever gotten with a giant hot dog. - Guys, look, Jorgen shrank Calamitous and trapped him in this bottle. - Can I keep him? - I'll get you, Neutron. I'll- - I don't think so, Professor. With the help of Turner's technology, you won't be threatening anyone for a long time. - Okay, so blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. The universe is saved. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to get my groove on, so listen up. Who are you going to the dance with, girl? (gentle music) - So, you really aren't a genius, are you, Timmy? - Sorry, Cindy. I didn't think you'd like me if I wasn't smart. - And he was right, right? 'Cause I'm warming up for the in-your-face dance. - But Timmy's still a considerate guy who actually pays attention to me. - Ha! In your face, lord of the lobes. - Oh, I really wish there were some way I could go with both of you. - Since you helped to free me and round up the Anti-Fairies, I would be happy to help with your puny and stupid problem. (Jorgen grunts) ♪ My shiny teeth and me ♪ ♪ Shiny teeth, shiny teeth ♪ - [Cindy] I'm having a great time, Neutron. - Me, too, Cindy. I'm glad you decided to come to the dance with me. - [Timmy] Mind if I cut in? - Hey, no fair. The upbeat boppy dances are mine. (Cindy giggles) - I can't believe we're jamming at the world's first-ever multidimensional dance party. - I know. Check it out. I'm flat. I'm bulgy. I'm flat. I'm bulgy. (Cosmo and Wanda laughing hysterically) (Carl whispering) - Ah! - Hi, Mrs. Neutron. - Ooh, yeah. - Time's up, Turner. I want my date back. - Wait your turn, Baron Von Boring. She's my date, too. - But it is my turn. - Is not. - Is too. - Is not. - Mine. - Uh-uh. - Uh-huh. - [Timmy] Never. - Boys, boys, please. This fighting over me has got to stop. ♪ My shiny teeth and me ♪ (mysterious dramatic music) (upbeat jazzy music) (mysterious dramatic music) (dog barks) (upbeat jazzy music) - [Man] Oh.
