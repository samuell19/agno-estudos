SEVEN YEARS IN MAY To Preto, who died way too soon. Open that, let's see what's inside. What do we got here? That's mine. One's mine, the other one's yours. Yeah. Gimme. I'm getting these boots 'cause I like them. Will it fit me? Beware of the bugs. You shouldn’t put your feet in like this... I'll try these boots on. See if they fit me. I've always dreamed about wearing this kind of clothes... Check out those cop's boots. This one is waterproof, nothing goes within it. They don't fit you, bro. Yes they do, you'll see. You'll have to give them to someone else… Come on, it fits perfectly. I told you. Be careful with this, don't do anything stupid. I'm taking these gloves so I don't get dirty with gunpowder. Let me see what you've got over there. I know it's yours, you took it first. Now you're rocking out, huh? Am I pretty? Look at your hair, it rules! It matches with your blouse. With this I'm gonna torture, gonna break teeths, gonna break it all. You're gonna see how it works, I'm gonna strangle people by their necks. Who are we looking like? I’m gonna tell you… We are... Special Operation's Department. A hundred per cent. Totally militia. The militiamen. Does anybody want anything else? Are we done? Yep. Right. I'll close it so we don't leave any proof. Let's go on with the operation. It'll rock. Wait, I'm gonna fasten this... Out on a operation you die for this stuff! You get shot while fastening your trousers! And what if they fall down? As you do it, you get shot. You can't behave like this. Ok, let's go. Hands up to the head, motherfucker! Open your legs, now. Police boarding. Open your legs! What's your name? Rafael. We received a complaint about your house. - Do you live on the 20? - Yes We received a report that you have a kilo of drugs. We are gonna take a look. There's nothing there, sir. What is this?

We are going to your place and if we find anything there we're gonna go around together, alright? - What's your name, motherfucker? - Rafael dos Santos Rocha, sir. Repeat it. Rafael dos Santos Rocha. - It's you we were looking for. - I don't have anything. We'll check it, if we find anything there... Get up, get up! I'm not a thief, sir. I'm not a drug dealer. I'm not going around with you. You're going with us. I don't have anything, I'm a worker. For Christ's sake, sir. You all say you're workers at moments like these... I was arrested in 2005, but I don’t owe anything. Are you sure? Don’t you owe anything? Today I'm blowing someone's head. - Gimme the gun. - Please don't do this to me. Do you wanna die now? Please don't, for God's love. Then you're gonna say where's the drug hidden. - There's nothing in my house. - Yes, there is! We've heard about it. - I'm telling you there isn't. - Yes, there is. I'm a worker. If you have something there, I'm gonna blow your head. I'm not messed with this... I told you I have nothing to do with this! I have nothing, please tell them! Oh, he's crying! It's a mama's baby! Stand up, stand up! We are checking it out. It's over for you, bro. You’re fucked up. For Christ's sake, people! Oh, Lord in the name of Jesus don't do that to me. Today we'll show you how it works. Let me go... Now you think about God, huh? When you are out there you don't think about God. you don't think about family, you don't care about anyone. And now that you've got caught you wanna cry? I've told you, I've been arrested but paid my debts. You know how prison works. In there, baby cries but mama can’t hear. If you go once you go twice, partner. I was taken for a drug dealer in 2007. Policemen caught me in front of my house and tortured me in the Energy Company's Substation. I was quiet... I was OK, working for a neighbour. I went back home at seven. When I was opening the gate, suddenly two vehicles stopped by and boarded me. "Rafael dos Santos?" I said: "Yes, that's me." "We heard you have one kilo of marijuana in your garden." I said: "There is nothing in my house, I've just arrived from work." They said: "Yes, there is." "We are gonna make a search in your residence." Two of them took me to the wall's edge. Near the fuse box. The rest of them started digging the backyard. They went to the cistern searching with flashlights. Some others broke into my house and started breaking everything. Throwing pots to the floor, opening cans, checking everything out. Rice, sugar, beans, throwing everything on the floor. They did the same in the other rooms. They threw everything on the floor, broke the wardrobe. But weren't satisfied. So they turned to me and said: "You're gonna go around with us." I said: "I ain't going with you." They said: "Yes, you are." They dragged me inside their van. I was resisting. I left my legs out but they started hitting me with the car door. They beat me. I was in pain so I put my legs in. They threw pepper spray inside and closed the doors. They took me. We arrived in a very dark place. They told me to get down and look aside. When I did, one of them caught me by my neck. Seven more started punching me. Beating a lot. They punched me on my chest so hard I fainted. I thought I was having a nightmare. When I opened my eyes I saw flashlights on my face. They picked me up. They put a bag on my face and started hitting me again. They punched and punched until the bag was covered with blood. They changed it and kept on beating me. I fainted many times. This other bag also got covered with blood. They grabbed a clean one, threw pepperspray on it and put it on my head. And kept on with the drubbing. Punching, punching, punching. They threw me on the floor and took the bag off. A policeman came and knelt on my chest. He stuck two guns in my mouth, forcing them, hurting it on the inside and outside. Two cops lifted my legs and started hitting them. They took the baton and hit each foot kinda fifty times. It gave me blisters on the feet. One of them found a lighter in my pocket and started burning me, here, like this. He burned me until I got another blister. I could even hear the sound of it exploding. He put the lighter into my back wound, pushed it hard and left it there hanging. They threw me to the floor. One cop said: "This motherfucker is trained." He got into the car and drove backwards. When the car was reaching my legs... About to run over them, hurting me, another one yelled: "Let's kill this motherfucker." Then they pulled me and dragged me around... They put me on my knees in front of the wall. A cop came carrying a knife and pulled my hair like this... And started cutting it with the knife, until it got almost shaved. He showed me his gun, a .38 or a .32. An old, rusty gun. He told me: "Now you're gonna die." I closed my eyes and heard four shoots. I felt the ground on my face. Everything was silent. I thought I was dead. Then I heard the car's door. I opened my eyes. One cop yelled at me: "Rafael, we're coming by next Friday we want R$5.000 in crack, R$5.000 in cocaine and R$5.000 cash. Just do it." They got in the car and drove away. I could hardly walk, I was really harmed. I slowly crawled myself away. Walking back home I ran into my friend China. "Fael, what happened to you?" I told him everything. He said: "Don't go home. Stay at my place. They can go back there and kill you tonight." I went with him. On 9 o’clock that Friday two police cars stopped at my mom's front door again. They ran into her house and asked her: "Where is Rafael?" She told them: “I know nothing about my son since you took him and didn't bring him back." “Where's my son?” “He was arrested but has already paid, here's his license.” And showed the license to them. They ripped it and threw it on my mom's face. They went back to the cistern again to check it out. When they were leaving one turned back at my mom and said: "Tell Rafael we don't need cash or drugs anymore. If we come across him we’ll throw his head on your yard." They got in the cars and drove away. My family was afraid. They sent me to São Paulo to live with my brother. I went to São Paulo and that screwed up my life. I lived in many places there. Many houses. I lived at my brother's, I lived at “The old men’s” house, I lived at some friend's huts, I lived at a shelter. The place where I stayed for the longest was Cotia. I started working as a drug dealer. I started doing drugs. A lot of drugs. "The old men", owner of the place, told me I'd better leave and work in the car chopping 'cause staying there was dangerous for me. I went to Embu das Artes to work in the car chopping. I’d been working there for a while. When suddenly, as we were dismantling a car out of the blue Marquinho yelled: "Fael, Fael, cops are at the door, let's get outta here!" I jumped the wall and tried to run. Then I heard the shots behind me. I knelt down and raised my hands to my head. I got kicked, punched, pounded. They caught me and other five people to jail. People from TV were there. There were reporters speaking about the car chopping cops had found. They took us. We all went to Itapecerica's jail. In two weeks... I thought we're gonna stay there for a long time. That evening I heard my name: “Rafael dos Santos Rocha.” I told my fella: "Has our license arrived?" This is something I can’t forget. I will always remember those two weeks. One guy came to our cell and said: "Hey you, I have your licenses. You are free to go." We went out of jail... When we were out I asked a man: "How do we get out of here?" We could only see bushes and an abandoned road. He said: "Follow here, you'll find a payphone." Down there, we called our bosses. We didn't know why we were free. They told us they've made an arrangement with the police. They paid 30.000 bucks to take us out of jail. So that we would respond only for a minor crime. I really wanted to go back home, São Paulo was over for me. I was heavily into drugs. I decided to go back to Belo Horizonte. I arrived in the city looking forward to be at home. I only had ten bucks but I was killing for some crack. I forgot to go back home. I walked to Santa Tereza's viaduct looking for a stone. I found it. I asked to smoke in a stranger's pipe and we did it. I asked him: "Where can we sell this mobile?" We found a place and I sold it for 30 bucks. He told me: "Let's go up to the village, drug is pure up there." We went there. On our way back he asked to borrow my jacket. I lent it. When I realized, he was gone with my jacket and the drugs. I was killing for more crack. When you buy shit and don't use it you go even crazier. Until you do it you won't have peace. I had cool boots I won. I walked down a hall and ran into street sellers. Those who buy and sell used stuff. I asked a guy: "Are these boots worth something?" "For us it's worth 12 bucks." "Only twelve?" I asked. "Will you sell them or not?" I said: "OK, c’mon." I sold them and just kept my socks on. I bought and smoked the crack. From this day on I didn’t go back home anymore. And started to live on the streets. I knew nothing. Spent that night wandering around. In the morning, while walking in Aarão Reis street, I suddenly saw Douglas, a guy I knew. I told him what was going on: "I don't wanna go home. I'm screwed and want to keep doing shit." He said: "So you shall make a move, you can't go on like this." I learned some stuff about cars. How to watch them out, wash them. I worked doing this stuff there for three months. Until I met Dentim. We started selling crack on the square. We were doing great, making money... But Dentim wanted even more. He started mixing pure drug with shit and selling it as pure. And then, some buyers noticed the difference. We sold everything we had and went back to our place. On the day after everybody was looking at me in a strange way. Lorim, a friend of mine, told me: "Some guys want to kill you and Dentim for those stupid things Dentim's been up to." I said: "What? What do we do now?" When nobody was watching Lorim and I took a bus to the village. Then I went walking to Dentim's house in Floresta. He was asleep. I woke him up and said: "The guys want to kill us because of that shit you've been up to. I'm going to Contagem." I left. When I arrived in Contagem I decided to leave the gangdom, but I couldn't quit drugs. I started smoking even more crack. I wandered around the streets, wishing I could back home, but I couldn't. I couldn’t do it, there was no way for me to do it. I had long hair, dirty clothes, nails uncut, greasy hair… I wanted to go back home, but not looking like I was. Everytime I laid on the street I listened to the same thing inside my head. I could hear the car's doors slamming and the police radio. "It's him right there!" "Let's go there and kill him!" "Let's get him now!" "Let's kill him!" It had never left my mind. I can still hear it. You have a sad story, just as many people I've met. Is your story different? It's just like yours. Have you been beaten by policemen too? Yes. I've been through so many things that every story I hear sounds like mine. Want some? Gimme. This anger is the worst. It never goes away. Those men's faces are the worst. They never disappear. You're right. Never indeed. When I was caught for the first time, they laid my face on the floor. Stepped on my arm and told me not to look at them. One of the cops felt sorry for me, he said they wouldn’t stop if I looked. But I didn't stop staring at them even for a minute. Do you remember their faces? I still do. Me too. Do you think they remember ours? I don't think so. We are all the same to them. My mom told me to forget about this stuff, stop thinking about it. I said that if I forgot, what they did to me would be completed. I think one day they will pay for what they did. Justice has to work for them too. What justice? What law? Has somebody ever asked you to write down a law? If I were a judge everything would be clearer. I would make everyone pay in kind. If you stole 10 bucks, you'd have to give 10 bucks back. If you had killed someone, you'd have to die too. But if you hadn't done anything no one should do anything to you. And you? What would you do if you could catch those cops? What would you do? Would you kill them? I don't think so. I would like them to suffer everything I suffered. The problem is that cops are just like ants. You catch one and five thousand, twenty thousand go after you. We are more than five thousand, much more than twenty thousand. But when they caught you, how many stood by you? How many neighbours saw you getting into the car and did nothing? The world is unfair not only because of the cops, bro. I don't know what's fair or unfair anymore. I just know I can't forget it. Being back here, in this place, it's like travelling in time. It's like that day lasted forever. We can still see your footprint on the floor. We can still see the blood stains on the street. And it's not only your blood. There are many people dying everyday. We are surrounded by a pile of dead people, bro. And that pile is only growing, since before we were born. And it's so tall it capped the sky. That's why everything is so dark. But there's no night that lasts forever. What we gotta do is to move on. For us and for them too. - Are you all listening to me? - Yes, sir. Dead. Alive. Dead. Alive. Dead. Dead. Alive. Dead. Dead. Alive. Dead. Alive. Alive. Dead. Alive. Dead. Dead. Alive. Alive. Dead. Dead. Out. Alive. Dead. Alive. Alive. Out. Dead. Dead. Out. Out. Out. Both of you. Alive. Alive. Out. Dead. Alive. Dead. Out. Alive. Dead. Alive. Dead. Dead. Out. Alive. Dead. Alive. Dead. Alive. Dead. Dead. Alive. Dead. Alive. Alive. Alive. Dead. Out. Alive. Alive. Dead. Alive. Dead. Dead. Dead. Out. Out. Right. Alive.
