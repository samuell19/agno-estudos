Last name? Zarubin First name? Aleksiej Father's name? Iwanowich Ready your place. Can you pass me the fork, please? When will they finally send us some spoons? We ordered them so many times. This is unbearable. I was dreaming of my house today. Not worth talking about. I was in such a good mood. I was hugging my wife and my daughter. I was so looking forward to spending the night with my wife. We'll be working together. Don't worry, a year and a half will pass very quickly. Put all the plates in the basin and wash them together. It's easier that way. Clear this part. Dig out a path, here, in this spot, two meters wide. Good. You got it? Dig in this direction. I'll check on you in half an hour. Finally we can do a normal patrol. At last on a snowmobile and not on foot. Let's take it for a ride. No, how many times am I supposed to tell you? No. That's why it got fixed, so it doesn't stand here, like some old junk. Until it's fully fixed, it's not going anywhere. So you want to walk? Here take the rifle and go! Wait until it's fixed! Go then, take this patrol. Go! Until it's properly fixed, it's not going anywhere. Nonsense. No means no. So why did you start fixing it in the first place? It needs to be done properly. Great, let it just stand here. Take the flashlight. Hold it like that. Let's walk straight home. So am I just supposed to light the road? There, look. We have to get there. Do you see that spot, where the light is? That's where we have to go. Let's go. Go, go. I will catch up with you. Where were you? I was walking straight ahead. Why didn't you wait for me? Well... Why did you go by yourself? You could see that I wasn't there! Where was 1? But sir, you told me to go. I told you? If I tell you to hit your head against the ice, will you do that? And what if a bear came? Remember once and for all, here, you can never be anywhere on your own. Here you need to follow the elders. Understood? Understood. Remember that, for the future. You went out on your own, without a knife or any weapon. You are watching the border. You notice that someone is trying to cross it. And is approaching your position. What do you do? 1 will try to stop him. You will try to, or you will stop him? 1 will stop him. How? By saying: Stop! Who's there? You come closer and see that he is in a critical state, has bad frostbite. And he reaches for a gun? No, he does not have a gun. So I will administer first-aid. Turns out that he was faking it. He takes out a gun and points it at you. How come? He didn't have a gun. He faked it all. - How could he fake it? - He pretended. Move it! Move it! Faster! Grab your cap, gun, move it! Faster, faster, time is running! Zip up and follow me! Are you playing games? If you were shot at, you'd be dead by now. During training, the bullets are right above your head. You're acting like it’s all a fairy tale. Or some fucking resort. Would you get up if I started shooting now? Your pants would be full of shit. And you're playing games. Idiot. Bad, really bad. Put the riffle in position and rest. What's this? You behave like this at home? Why are your shoes all over the place? Where are your felt boots and covers? Everything should be ready, we will now drill the wake-up call. Everything needs to be in its place. The uniform must be folded neatly. Understood? Understood. You need to be ready for the drill. The army should be made up of professionals. Made up of experts. People who want to and can serve in the army. Why did they send him here? What should he be doing then? 1 will learn. He will dig for wood and carry water. The boy was supposed to learn. He would be more useful, if he went to university. You wanted to join the army? 1 did, but not to serve in the north. Where? to the south, where the girls sunbathe? It's better there. Better? The conditions are just different. You don't know where it's better. You are young and don't know where is better. Turns out, it's ten times better here. Here, we are all boiling in one pot. You can't survive here by yourself, but nobody expects it from you. Grab your felts and rubber boots. Show him how to wrap his feet. Observe and learn. Take off your boot. Why is your leg cover loose? Because it's too short. If you run, it will slip off your foot and hurt you. It has to stick like a sock. Why is the cover better than a sock? Socks slide when you run. Stop! Take off your hands! It has to be like this, so his toes don't freeze! Fucking, idiot! See? You wrap it like this. This way your toes won't freeze. This bit you put here. And then your toes won't freeze. Here, wrap it tighter. This place is perfect for you to spend the next two nights in. A bit more. You need to fit in your legs. To all my friends, with whom I was so happy to live once upon a time... My hand got tired. The hand of the brave is tired of war... Like in Lermontov's poem about the battle with Napoleon: The hand of the brave is tired of war... Wake up! Time to come out. You alive? Get up. Move it, move it! Don't sleep, you'll freeze to death. You ok? Fuck. Pack your bag and let's go home. Quickly, faster, faster. You'll catch a cold. Hurry up. Just throw it all in. Roll it tighter. Faster, faster. We are almost there. How I missed this base! Happy Holidays! Were you baptized? Yes. Take off your uniform. Breakfast will be ready soon. - Is everything ready? - Look at the table. Barley with apples. I am so happy to see you all. Thankfully you are all right. Let's have a competition. Grab an egg. What an egg I have! Everyone, come to the table! I have an unbreakable egg. Who is going to fight me? Where is that egg of yours? Valentin with balls of steel. Who wants to fight? Sense of humor is not dead, as long as people like you are still alive. Where is this unbreakable egg? Will you be hitting? No, you. This egg is no good! Look at him, he knew how to hit. 1 got him in the balls! Today we neither work, nor wash the dishes, nor clean. Today we are to do nothing! But tomorrow...! Tomorrow we work, full time. Today is the 27th of March? 1 will be 50 years old in a month. Round number, half a century. And Border Guard Day. What a coincidence your birthday and Border Guard Day on the same day. THE SKY SPARKLES WITH THE MOON LIGHT, THE STREET IS STILL AND QUIET. MOTHER STANDS BY THE WINDOW, GUARDING YOU LIKE AN ANGEL. IN THE NIGHT, SHE'LL COME QUIETLY, TO OPEN THE DOOR FOR YOU NOBODY ELSE, BELIEVE ME, ONLY MOTHER. AND IF IN A FEW YEARS, WHEN YOU TRAVEL THE WORLD YOUR MOTHER WILL WAIT FOR THE LETTERS FROM HER SON. AND IF ONE DAY, YOUR GIRL LEAVES YOU YOUR MOTHER WILL HELP WIPE OFF YOUR TEARS. ONLY MOTHER. To friendship, to loyalty and to true friends. To the Russian soul. Good job, you lasted 30 hours. Enough. Take it away. A bit more. One more. He who seeks, finds. I dragged it all by myself. Good job. Change your clothes and come eat. There will be borstch. Good news. Tell me, since you got here, what is the purpose of life? You look at me, like a little fox, who lurks and observes. You wait to see what will happen next. A small fox. If you rub your dick instead, it will stand like... Now try this. They should burn. This is your energy. It is incredible how it wakes up. You can even see this energy. With it you can detect the presence of any object in the distance. You can learn that. When you’re in an ambush, you don't have to see with your eyes. You can feel the animal or human approaching. Exercise three times a day. When you start to freeze, hold your breath for a minute. Then again, and five more times. Your body will start to function as if it were hooked to a battery. Now the left. The left? But the right one is hurting me. Change. But the right hand is hurting me. Go on, boy. Don't rush, concentrate. Go on boy, squeeze him. What, you leaving already? You will break the table! Look, you throw ahead. Try to stand on your legs. Toss me, but stay on your feet. Let’s go, end of training. Thanks. We need to change. Tell me, please, how did you lose your fingers? When I was young, I worked in a mine. I graduated from The Mining Institute. One day, an expert came, drunk and exploded only half the charges. Part of it exploded next to my workstation. The closest town was 30km from us. I wrapped my hand up, jumped on a horse and galloped to the hospital. There, they stitched whatever was left of the hand. Later I won fighting competitions using only one hand. A man can do a lot, if he only wants to. He can generate an inner energy ten times larger than normal. I function with one hand only. The other is just for help. Ready! Go! Go, Zarubin! Time: 1 min. 14 sec. Good job! The first task is completed. But your sewing is wrong. Why didn't you turn it inside out? Mama didn't teach you? You turn it inside out and then you sew. It's not comfortable like that. Not comfortable? You turned out with something pornographic. Your mother didn't teach you? I taught myself. Itis OK. I still have one more to mend. What do you want to be in the army? A sniper. Snipers kill people. Do you want to kill people? This is the army. Who doesn't kill here? Even radio operators kill if they must. I don't remember, from which year did they take you? The first. Will you go back to the university? Yes. Can an atom be divided? No, an atom can't be divided. Prove it! Earlier, at the very beginning, I served in the Far East. Later, I was not lucky in life. Perestroika began, I had some dealings with the hooligans of Petersburg. I got on the wrong path. Had debts, and debts need to be paid back. Someone came along and, recommended that I sign a contract for three years. You do your service, make money, pay your debts, and then go back to normal life. This is how I got here. Relax. Have you ever thought that you would be standing at the edge of Russia? There is a saying. Not everyone is meant to walk on the edge of the nation. Nice quote, no? Run! You want to go abroad? Further North? People pay to travel abroad but we can simply walk. And where exactly is the border? There. Sing something. You want some? Just don't get sick. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY NICE THINGS, AND DON'T BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF COMPLIMENTS, BUT I'M READY TO GIVE YOU ALL MY LOVE SO LET'S BE TRUTHFUL WITH EACH OTHER TODAY. Women, women... You will never guess what they need. On the other hand, our life without women... The strangest thing is that... With my first wife I had lived for 15 years. With my second also 15 years and now I am afraid to go back home. I have a feeling that we will split up. You shouldn't even think that. I don't think. I chase away these thoughts. But I can feel it! I look at her and... You know... The Wife, The wife... There is a poem, by Lope de Vega... I heard it at a military hospital in 1977. Doesn't matter how I got there. I just remembered a part of this poem: Wife, this word smells of hell When you lie down, the wife lies next to you. When you get up, she gets up with you. The night has fallen, she is in your bed. The cover is over your body. But she is pulling it her way. I am not sure why I remembered this part. I don't trust women. Soon we will be able to fish. We'll chop him in a minute. The board is ready. Step aside. You shouldn't stand in the line of the axe. We got a tough one. Now stand on the other side. 1 will just take the water out. 9th of May, Victory Day Too bad there are no women around. They would appreciate this smell. Officer Niekrasow, raise the flag. To victory. To our victory. The orchestra played. Captain, with your permission, we will begin our cultural program. Begin. Take your guitar. Russia, the land of our fathers, huts and saintly icons There is no edge to it, no end to it, only eyes sank in the vast blue As a poet once said: You cannot comprehend Russia with your mind, you cannot measure it with Arishin Special is the essence of Russia — Russia you can only believe in it. Fiodor Tiutchev To our mothers! What kind of music would you like? Something modern, temperamental. I cannot dance to this rhythm, but I'll do my best. Liosha, in a month, I'm going back home. My daughter runs around and calls: Where is Daddy? I want my Daddy! I am glad, that you managed here so well. Good job. Walera, don't smoke here, we agreed. 1 will leave this place, but you will stay. Others will come. Teach them, what I tried to teach you. I know your weakness. Here. And quit smoking. The last time I smoked was in 1975, over 30 years ago. I loved a woman. You know how I loved her? I wrote her letters from the army. She wrote me back. I was waiting for her to greet me when I finished. Want me to tell you the truth? Yes. You know what love is? First love? She's... Supper! Sergeant, it's stuffy in here. Where are my boots? Supper! I cannot eat. Are you on a diet? Have you noticed that I smoked? So a diet. Soon I will go home... Give me a break. You know what? Marinka, my little Uzbek sleeps in our bed with someone else. When I come back, I'll fucking kill her. What are you talking about? You need to trust women. I trust... I love her, Captain. Have you gone nuts or what? Walentin, you've got matches? I don't smoke, how can I have matches? I love her, you understand? More so you need to trust her. Liosha! You know how it is. The toughest are the last days. When you start it's much... Walera, let's go to sleep. Who, me? I still have to do my patrol. Rest before your round. Get some sleep, an hour at least. You know what? If I was small, it means that one day I'll become a general. You didn't want to be a general? Let's finish the concert and get some rest. Bitch. The child. When I get back... Come, I'll show you Russian extreme. Grab the axe. Hit it! - I'm afraid? - Afraid of what? Aim and hit. I can't. I'm afraid. Aim and hit! A bit higher. Hit it. What are you afraid of? It's my problem. A Hooligan's heart is broken. There are twelve such military bases in the Russian Federation. They were set up in the fifties to populate and defend the twelve thousand kilometres of the Russian northern border. There has never been any military intervention in their vicinity.
