Come on, remove fast It doesn’t look if someone sees. - Come on, none would see Dad isn’t already feeling well Daddy - Come dear Daddy Did son in law come? - What happened, dad?

They are tired in journey - Ok Sir. Go dear, you go and take bath - You take rest, father in law I’ll take care, you go. - Careful father in law Daddy... Hey, you go and take bath. Go. Enough! - Come on, have it. It’s been very long since you ate food at our house Talk, open up and talk No father in law, we are anyways leaving tomorrow I’m very happy that you came when called even after being so busy. I wish to ask an important matter with you, in this happy moment. Nothing, I thought would have one fish piece. Come on father in law, have it. But, I really have a wish in my heart. Shall I say? Say, dad She is my sister’s daughter. He is my best friend’s son I’m living without a fear to have given my children to some strangers by bringing these. I wish it’s better we get my granddaughter and grandson married in the same way. That doesn’t mean you should say immediately. Think well tonight and say by morning. Why all these now, daddy. Even your health isn’t good and we got to leave back tomorrow I mean, they two are into job recently. We thought why marriage so fast Youth now are into late marriages, Father in law Come on, I’m not saying marriage immediately. I felt it’d be good by fixing about that now. Oh, like that? - Yes, like that What man, did you keep vegetables in baby’s car? - Yes Sir Hey, did you keep fish and dry prawns in Murali’s car I’ll keep them now, Sir Keep it fast, man. Hey Raju! - Hey, come on Are your children leaving right now? -Yes, Come... Father in law Daddy... why don’t you also come down to Hyderabad? Why dear, all these are here to take care of me. Be seated Give medicines time to time for father in law - Ok madam By the way, what did you think about the wish I said in the night? About the kids marriage. We like it dad, but let’s ask him once and then What about son in law? - What you said yesterday is true, father in law There won’t be any fear if we give in a known family Thank God! All have agreed. About the kids, I’ll take care of them. Hey, will you always be with that phone? Not me but you! I never said anything when you checked share details on your phone Don’t unnecessarily say anything. I said the reality. You’d always sit with that useless phone When you sit idle without talking, what shall I do? Shall I sit watching your face? Look Rishi, if you feel what I do are wrong, what you do also make me feel wrong. This is what I don’t like. When something is said for good, learn to listen I don’t like others controlling me. Get out if you don’t like. Nobody is coming behind you here. I can see my future with you, Rishi. I am afraid. Have you used? Have you used your weapon? Hey, stop that crying first. I can see my future now and right here. Then, I too don’t need you, like this Still you don’t give the value to humans, but just for money. Hey, don’t talk too much. It won’t set now for us, get lost. Hey Guthi Bhadram What, man? Somaraju Sir died, it seems. How did it happen? I too don’t know. Come on, go fast Very casual person, very lucky man that he died in his sleep He used to say one should always be in smiles and that is healthy. And finally we are left behind with just his smile. Daddy... Daddy... - Grandpa... Daddy... Daddy... Brother... Daddy, brother Daddy... Son in law, it’s getting dark. Let’s take him fast. Control yourself. Baby Varsha, we shall take grandpa. Sir. Lamp should be on till the 11th day. keep observing. Dear... Father in law. Come uncle, be seated What son, are you on any work? It all happened suddenly, uncle I’m mailing leave to office Baby, Raghavamma Rishi is gone to bring mother, father in law. Have you just come father in law? - Yes dear I had slight body pains and slept Murali, I just enquired from the priest. As per Raju’s astrology the after death events are on the 3rd day and then the 11th day Murali, what are you thinking? Nothing uncle, thinking 11 days leave for office... Murali, you shouldn’t cross even the border till the 11th day Only the relatives nearby attend on 3rd day and on the 11th day, all from everywhere come down. Money and all moved on always with his sign. Now, you should take care. As we have to make it grand, more money will have to be spent It’s tough for us to bear everything, please ask brother also to share some Am I son to spend money, fine if it is as a debt? How can it be so brother, same happened to you too along with us, right? That was father in law’s responsibility and he did Even this is your responsibility Hey Varsha... Go in Look sister, we came for the last sight. That’s all but what is this fifty-fifty deal and this discussion? Brother in law, give if you feel as a responsibility or else no. But, don’t slip your tongue. Did you give when my dad died? This too is similar I said to lend money as loan if you don’t have money, in a good way. What else did I say? Leave all that, you built a house in Hyderabad recently right? Did you call me for that house warming ceremony? How would I feel? Brother, it isn’t correct for you to talk so. When we came to your house last month for a function, you went around not looking at us like strangers What is that called, then? - Latha dear, you wait Anybody will give money in this village by saying Raju’s name. He’s given money to others as far as I saw, but never took money from anyone. But still, I asked as it would give his soul satisfaction and not that I don’t get money in this village. Why do you get into unnecessary discussions? That’s what uncle, when I’m asking the same, he’s screaming to escape from it. Fine for me and I’ll give half. If you still don’t have, I’ll give the entire amount. Let’s spend in equal halves from now and take in equal halves. Don’t talk at your will. Talk being in senses. Hey, stop it. You are going to be in laws soon and all this will be yours after the marriage. No.. Father in law, they are like this now and who knows how they’d be after marriage. Nobody is sitting here in waiting for you You gave word to Raju that you’ll get them married, right? He asked me to get married at known people’s house and I too am doing the same. But not these and I’ll giving to those I know. Not all this nonsense father in law, I said ok as he was ill that day. But... Otherwise, why would I give my daughter in such a house? We too thought the same way If she wasn’t at home, there wouldn’t be any issues. Murali, what are you talking? Son, it isn’t even one day since brother passed away and what are these issues? Don’t kill brother further by doing all such You had great studies and all those are a waste. Come in after your crying is done Mother in law, Father... Don’t feel sad dear. I never expected the kids to talk so. You should ask only me for all the expenses required now for brother. Brother always used to say that entire house should be full of happiness. But these are thinking to be just happy for themselves only. Don’t feel bad granny I couldn’t see your grandpa even for the last time. What’s the use to know about the people around after death? Yes true! As my sister said what’s use to know after death? I understood that my kids I saw that day aren’t true and my bringing up wasn’t true. I felt how to be amongst them for 11 days in between them in such a situation. They say entire life runs back in front of the eyes for anyone before death. But it ran for me after death. “So many joys and great happiness” “When you turn into humans” “Blossoming affections and strong bond” “You are the world of love” “Like the forts of smiles” “Like the melodies by the bees” “They mesmerized me as the tickles” “When dad turned as mom” “He served his love with affection” “They pampered me as a couple” “It’s a blossom when one is with the other” “It’s heaven sleeping together after getting tired” “Naughty tune is played saying everyday is a festival” “Sharing this evergreen feel of love forever” “Ours is a good time, let it be forever” “Affection never gone away is strength” “This human life is just for a few days” “Only the love you share comes with you after death” “None of your people will be your people” “You are the only companion for you” Hello, I’m Murali - Say son Dad’s 3rd day is tomorrow - Oh, I see And 11th day is next Wednesday. Ok - See you Did you inform Nagaiah uncle? - I said, mother in law Where is this fellow? Who, Kothem ? - Yes We shall serve food for brother He is not to be seen from yesterday. Ok! Baby, baby - Coming, mother in law We shall serve food for dad, bring in plantain leaf - Ok, mother in law It’d have been good if Kothem was home. He’d have taken care of everything Not for him to be, but check if everything is there at home. He isn’t such a guy. Murali! You too go up with Baby, it’s good that you both are there. Go! Ok, I’ll go down Hey, what are you doing for so long? Are you still here? Hey, why are you crying? Where are crows in these days? Come on now! Sister called and said they aren’t coming for the 3rd day. They are sending that Santosh idiot, be careful. You know about him, right? Come on, let’s go down I forgot to say by the way, we too are going home along with Santosh on the day after. Are you getting me? Hey, what are you doing here? Go down What did you do, then? - I made everything into ponds, dude All are doing the same now and it’ll work out well. Hey, where are you coming from? - Did you listen to this, dude? It seems crows didn’t touch the food offered for Raju Sir Then, some big wish must’ve been left behind for him. Tomorrow is 3rd day, right? Yes - Let’s see Hey Santosh, where are you? - Rajahmundry Is it? Have you heard? Then, talk to him. Sir What’s the delay? - We are right here Sir, we are coming. Come fast. - Ok Sir, ok What Satti, increasing the sound as you wish right? I’ve become very cheap to you. For you and for my dad I’m observing, man. My dad is attending birthdays... and parties and is asking me to go for deaths. I’ll say once I become MLA. I’ll give you a gift and a return gift to my dad. Ok Sir, I’ll reduce it - No need, now Hey stop, stop the vehicle Why Sir, will you go for toilet? -No, idiot! Go back Stop, stop man Where to go? - I should go to the next village Hey, unlock the door. Maybe you can’t see him If you first go, open that door, he’ll get in. Ok, close the door How long is it? - What Sir? Not you, Satti idiot. You drive Me, Sir? It’s been 4 days since I died What was your profession? - Politician Politics? - Yes - What happened, then? I contested in my village as MLA You just stopped car and picked me up and that’s my village Then why are you going to the next village, for toilet? No Sir, for that guy not to see my grave there and laugh Who is he? - That MLA who won That means you...? I lost and drank pesticide unable to bear that pain and died. So, you lost? I’ve been saying to be the lost MLA Hey Satti, stop the car What happened, Sir? Should I give him water? -Ask him to get down Why Sir? I don’t like the losers and especially those losing in politics Stop idiot, ask him to get down. To lose is a bad thing and to die drinking pesticide is further bad. Ok, move on. Hey, open the door man. Ok Sir What, if a politician? Get down He got down, close the door man. Ok Sir (Chants) Chandraiah Sir - Sir Collect the bones and mix them in Godavari river on 7th day, don’t forget. Ok priest Sir. Madam, you’ve arranged for everything liked by Somaraju Sir, right? He’d stay right here for these 11 days and will be observing it all (Chants) No problem Sir, keep even that here Madam, the process completed well Chandraiah Sir - Sir I’ll send the list of materials needed on 11th day - Ok Sir When did you come from US, uncle? I started once I came to know But, my flight got delayed Uncle... Don’t feel sad, son. All will have to die. But Raju passed away ahead of us Janaki! Uncle.. - Don’t cry dear He always used to say about you all. Seeing you all like this, I feel like seeing him. If you are all happy, we’d say to him that all his kids are happy when we go to him. Hey, what are you opening all the doors like mad fellow? Hello uncle.... - Hello What happened? That is, the doors... - That is... For the air in to go out Not so Sir, on the way... - Why do you need? Why for you, go What happened on the way? Cigarette on the way and he made it all, a mess. Is it so? Is this the house? - Yes This looks like a big lost party office. He is my father in law. Brother in law, he looks very young. Swine flu? No, that is the picture from young age. Is everybody fine? - fine. Hello Sir - Hello Is water and current perfect - Yes Sir Is the hospital working fine? Come on, let’s go Future politician, uncle. All those later, why now? Ok, fine! Take care... Wash your feet and go. Can he see me? The tumbler. Did he pass away? Yes, pray without ruining my prestige. I prayed, move Are you good? - Ok, fine Shall we leave? - Ok! See you Sit here, man - Ok It isn’t vacant What? I mean, it isn’t clean. Uncle.... Uncle... I’m right here, what? I mean why here, why not go back in the night. I men why here tonight, instead let’s go back. Brother in law asked to come tomorrow, right? Not that... - Huh! What do we do here, till then? Go eat and sleep. You mean, that’s the only work I do. Ok, where is the food? Don’t die, this way it seems. I know it is that side. You know my foot. - I’m seeing for the guy to hand you over. I felt who could see me after I turn into a soul. My luck and I was visible to that Santosh. Because of no way, I beg him to help me to fulfil my last wish. I think the food session isn’t over yet. Are you hungry? Mill people haven’t come yet and it’d take some more time All should have food, right? Ok I forgot to say, some friend of Shivaji brother is coming it seems. I think they are in some plan - He’s an idiot, leave it Mom and daddy! Sister of my father in law. Hello madam. - Hello... Aunty, my friend Ramesh. He stays right here in Tanuku. He is a big contractor and says to buy the land under his feet, anywhere Good, move on. Come on. My brother’s son, go and wish him. Hello... - Hello. I am a contractor. What do you do? We both are into jobs in Hyderabad. I see. I saw your dad in Shivaji’s marriage. He was very jovial man Dad... Mill people have come and they wish to meet you. Ok, see you Sir. - Thank you Hello Sir... - Hello Sir Raju Sir always said a person is good when house is good and that village is good when person is good. He never let me come to his house for any need. We never expected such a day to come, Sir. He took care of us too like his children, Sir. Move on, they should eat after you finish. Move on. Ok Sir, we’ll go... - Come on, in Come on, in - Move, let’s eat Your father in law and his mill are very famous in the surrounding areas. Even the mill is worth more than 15 Crores. Ok, let’s meet on the 11th day, start now Ok. I, Santosh with my magical cleanliness... Sorry with my soul cleanliness Next... Hey buffering... Huh! I, Santosh... Oh no! You can never become a politician though you practice a lot like this. No, those alive should say that. Santosh... Damn! Listen to me grandson. Thank God, no grandpa here. Yes, this is peaceful. I should get a good talisman tied once I’m back in Hyderabad, so that I don’t see these souls It’s become a big mess Oh no, what grandpa even here? My foot! You made me run around the house like making a kid run behind the ice cart. What do you need now, grandpa? A small help. I’ll do it grandpa, I’m in the middle and let me finish. I beg you, grandpa. No peace even in the bathroom. Still, won’t you souls have no work? You all come and fall on me with list after dying when I have my own problem Then say what you need and I’ll help you. If that is done, you should help me I’m unable to anything being alive and what can you do? I’ll give a great idea. Is It! If your idea is of no use to me, you should never again be seen to me. Ok? Ok You know my father? Your father’s father is my friend. My father decided that I’m useless in politics. You should make my dad say I’m a great man. Will you do? Does your father have any problems? That’s me, right? I thought you were problem only to me. So, you are a problem even to your dad, then? Is there any problem other than that? Another problem means, my father lost election last year. That’s why they are giving ticket to an NRI, who has a rich man. My dad is very angry in that matter and that is his problem. Then, call your father - Now? He’d come here and hit if I call now. You first call him and ask him to make that NRI sing national anthem without any mistakes in front of the media. If this doesn’t work out, you’ll have it. Father, it is me... I know who you are, but say what’s the matter. Your seat is given to some other, right? For you to get back that seat, make that NRI fellow sing National anthem in front of the media. All this is a waste, grandpa. My father never cares about any of my word. Politician at this time would talk even if a dog calls up. This matter just now... Hey, you mean to say I’m a dog? You’ll know that in the morning. First go and sleep. I’ll finalise even your matter in the morning. Bro, can you listen now? Hello... Tell me man, I can hear now. Thank God Net isn’t good here, just check the share market and inform. Ok, will see and tell Hey, is Varsha still the same? Yes We know about a few, right? They talk whatever they feel like to blabber. We should maintain some distance Ok dude, bye. Stop! I should talk to you for two minutes. I didn’t blabber at my will. I spoke the reality. I too said the reality. You feel, I started it again right? I haven’t come here to fight or talk with you. I called to inform that we are just cousins from now. Being cousins isn’t the matter now, we shall celebrate grandpa’s 11th day well Looks like you are still in the same thoughts. Go and play your game Cousins, my foot. Son in law, it feels good that you too stay back till 11th day is done. If you feel bored, come towards our mill. It’s yours anyways in future, right? You shouldn’t say that father in law, those who should tell needs to say. Murali, here is father’s death certificate. This is bank pass book. Your signature is valid as the nominee What are you watching? Get ready fats and we shall leave. Uncle, we don’t need anybody. You should be here and take care of everything till 11th day is done. What’s this uncle, there’s just 2 Lacks and odd in this? I don’t know son. What don’t know uncle, what did he do with all this money? Damn! They say no bones for the donating hand, looks like he has no hand at all. What’s that Murali? Brother, why did you come to this fellow? I’ve already informed that I’d bear all the expenses. Murali, you do as you wish with that money. But before saying something just remember that you are saying it to your dad. Damn! Grandpa, phone Lift the call and talk. Grandpa, it’s my dad and I’m gone now. You’re great, man - Great! Father, I’m Santosh speaking. Yes, I’m saying you are great. What happened father? That fellow became a big fool as he couldn’t sing Vandematharam in front of media. I got the seat because of you, son. Is this idea yours or... Where do I get father, grandpa... Idiot, say yours - Mine, it’s mine Is everything fine - Yes, father. When are you coming back? It’s tomorrow.... Say, you are coming after some days. I’ll be here for some more days, father. More ideas will come if I stay here Why alone? You and Shivaji uncle be right there. Ok father, see you. Grandpa, my father said me great. You are super. Say now grandpa, I’ll do whatever you need. I too should feel the same happiness seeing my kids like how your father felt by seeing you. I didn’t understand. In your language, my kids should get along and my family should be happy. Understood? - Completely... Still, uncle said it all over phone to me. You happily sit here, I’ll just be gone and come back. I’ve done so many settlements as such in Hyderabad. I, Santosh am giving assurance. I’ll do the settlement For the grandpa, by the grandpa... I expected. Instead of crying so, why don’t you say and cry? No grandpa, I just went singing songs. So... Dining table and this place is correct If I take a class in single sitting, all will sit along and have lunch in five minutes. Uncle! This guy is a TikTok fellow! Uncle! Hey uncle.. - Why’s this hug? Are you still not ready? We are not going back to city now. Not going? - No Should I call your father or what? Crazy my dad said it himself. What did he say? Shall I say another matter? - Say My father got the MLA seat - What? Maintain the same expression and I’ll just come back. I’ll be gone to the mill. Uncle, come here Be seated, uncle - What? Just five minutes. I asked you to maintain expression, right? Say... Sit. What I say now... What I say now may sound like big words for you. Nothing wrong but I have no way out. If there’s any matter, we shall talk face to face and settle. But, to fight in the dark is a waste matter Do we take any of these wealth, properties or inner wear with us to the heavens? Now grandpa died, hello listen. Grandpa died and did he take anything? All the inner wear too in that room is lying there. You’d die tomorrow soon - Hey, what are you saying? Tomorrow means not tomorrow, uncle. It’s in general... you’ll die and I’ll die. Do we take anything up? We won’t take anything with us And do we need all these fights, hitting the flower pots and again asking on phone like why did you hit the flower pot? That’s why silently be together. I’ll sit here and close my eyes. By the time I open my eyes, all of you should be singing the family song together. Ok? Take care now. Ready! The train is coming... Not this one. Here, there and everywhere... Ready! He won’t change Oh! Did it happen so? Yes grandpa, what’s the next plan? Take that photo and throw it down You’d say anything grandpa! But, if anyone sees I too will change into a soul and we both will have to play hide and seek right here. Nothing will happen, do what I said. As you wish. Sure, grandpa? Grandpa! Where is grandpa? You got me well trapped, grandpa! I’m gone now How did the photo break? - Baby, careful! Glass pieces may pierce Why did it happen so at this time? When all are in the house like this, the same will happen. It happened so as you are like this in the house. Yes, you feel like everything is given to us by you and thus we are like this If not are we any diseased like you to sit separately like you? Yes brother in law, when people like you come in as in laws, we will be blessed with BP and Sugar Oh no, bad time. I can’t better these guys - Me too Let me ask you something, were you good to us any time? Once when I took money from you when in problem, you gave and took interest for the same. That is you. Added, you lied saying that money wasn’t yours. I remember everything. I understand the same, people like you say the same after taking money. Has at least anyone come when my dad wasn't feeling well? Who said not to be getting a leave when called and informed about his 11th day after his death? It was you! You get a cutting in salary by taking leave and that is your feeling. Money is important for you and people are important for us. Is this what we get to listen staying here for so long? Not that... - What? Latha... What is this? Mother in law, you know nothing and it was us who felt bad You go in. Ok, I’ll go in and you both die fighting with each other. Yes brother, you are too good. Do you remember? When we gifted gold for Varsha’s saree function, you didn’t even gift a saree at least as a tradition. That shows who is greedy about money. You stop it, dear. Have you ever given us food when we came to your house in city? Leave it, have you at least offered us tea? Not all these, you insulted saying no need of anyone after seeing the pass book recently, right? Brother in law, you don’t say anything more now - You don’t talk too much. What are you talking? What are you talking? -Daddy, stop it! Why do you say each other unnecessarily? Those won’t come back again. Mom, move on. Hey, if you touch this our relation won’t go well To hell, how do I stay back here for five more days? That day, I thought to remind their love in between, even by breaking my family photo But they considered big and small in terms of money, got into unnecessary misunderstandings... I felt the forgot about the real love in between them. They looked very great even to me, who always used to say my children were great. Condition of my brain seeing so much in life was like that of the marble stuck in the soda bottle. That day for the first time, I couldn’t be in my own house. Grandpa! Grandpa! Have you vanished again? Good that I knew this magic to get vanished. Then die. Oh, are you here? What is this, grandpa? Do they sleep outside the house in your village when you are disturbed? Nothing less for this angers What is next now? Do you go and sleep outside the village now? Leave all these and watch this TiKToK video, grandpa Do they need this, grandpa? Damn it! Put that in. Ok, I kept it - Come with me and I’ll say Grandpa, following you was… Open the Bhoshanam(locker) - Did you scold? I said the box, man. Open it. Take out the diary from that. Oh wow! Grandpa, is this your biopic? Make it fast, grandson! There is no time for us, man No time my friend, is it the death or… Oh, you’re already dead Yes, move now. Keep that diary there. Oh! You feel by keeping this diary there, they’d read it and do your biopic, right? Sodas Raju, I have no death Ok, I’ll put it. Are you reading the paper? Ok, read. Read it. Good news! Grandpa! Grandpa, see What grandpa, are you tensed? Yes, grandson. You don’t understand something. You are long dead and why tension now? Look, they are seeing it. You’ll sleep outside the village with this tension now. Bad time! See now and the story begins - Oh! Mom, your spectacles are here. I’m in the kitchen, dear. Bring it here. Ok, I’m bringing. Grandpa, your biopic is a doubt. Mahanati biopic... - What's wrong with you? Why not say they came?' - Did you get it good? Whatever, but yours is a very loose tongue. Oh no, where is the diary? - Where is that fellow? I believed you so much, idiot. You cheat me this much Hey, do whatever you can, idiot Let it be gone. You don’t feel tensed Take the tablets and rest. What’s wrong, dear? His friend does real estate business, brother. He and his friend together bought a land. He invested money in it. Now, he says that land as his and that it is on his name. And he is very much tensed. One minute, what is his name dear? Srinivasa Rao, brother. Where does he stay? - Kukatpally That Govinda real estates, brother. One minute... Govinda Real Estates Srinivas, it seems from Kukatpally We should get a call within one hour. No problem at all dear, I spoke on the phone and you have nothing to worry You’ll get a call in some time. Come in dear, I got to talk to you. Did Father in law write to give the mill to them if we get Rishi and Varsha married? Yes dear - Really, brother? Latha, what is that Srinivasa Rao calling now and saying sorry? Sivaji brother has done this for us. Thanks brother in law. I was very tensed. Sorry for everything. Come on, what sorry brother in law. Why all these in between us? You are happy, right? Both you and we are happy when you are like this, right? Murali... Just four days are left behind for the 11th day. We shall arrange for the tents and the other materials. I and Rishi will go and give order for the food. Grandpa... Grandpa! Your family film is super hit You know theatre is running houseful inside So, my diary plan is working out. If we take it all in this size aunty, we get photo from here... Why are all talking about something? Why not say that even to me? Nothing, a small discussion about Father in law’s flex and paper Ads Brother, are you seeing any matches for Varsha? I thought it’d have been good if it was a boy like Rishi. We too thought it’d be good if girl was like Varsha. Yes, even dad asked for the same then. Yes brother in law. Have it mother in law. Here, even sister in law is here while we are talking. Brother, they say good should happen at the house experiencing the bad, right? What, sister in law? About Rishi and Varsha’s marriage, sister in law. But, we should ask even Varsha and Rishi, right? Varsha, come here dear Daddy... If you say grandpa’s photo size, I and Chandraiah grandpa will go to town, order and get it. Wait son, I’ll say. Rishi, you and Varsha are in the same profession. You both know each other well and added you both are cousins. That’s why we are thinking to get you married. What, why all this now, mom? Why about now and all, come on say I don’t like, mom. Same for me too... I don’t have any thought as such. Again! Walk in the morning for health, crazy grandpa? I expected something but something else is happening. Don’t get so much tensed grandpa, say what’s there in that diary? I wrote to give my mill in equal halves to them when my grandson and granddaughter get married. What grandpa? My last wish is to get my grandson and granddaughter married. You just said enough if your children get along and what’s this marriage now? They get married only if they get along, right? Use your brains Oh no, I’m going mad. I’ll say whether I should use or you are using me, but you say the matter clearly. Sshh...! My grandson and granddaughter came to me and asked to get them married. Then while I was thinking to somehow get them married and how it goes if write the mill jointly on their name... my children agreed for their marriage by themselves. I thanked God for that, but I suddenly passed out. Later as my kids were fighting each other saying not to get them married, I with you have used my diary. Bad luck! My kids came along but their kids didn’t agree for the marriage. We should somehow get them married. I should help in person to get them both married. Yes! They both are the reason to go ruined in reality. Your grandson is a rogue and your granddaughter is a crack. Now, should I be here and see when they both are getting married? Impossible! Even if you plan something else and try to get them married, I’d myself ruin that. I challenge! Why did he go like this? What’s my situation now? Give one shot of toddy, man Here, take it - What is this? Damn! How will you drink, then? Don’t you have a beer mug? I have the plastic mug, I use in the mornings. Shall I get that? - Dam it! Come on show it? - What’s this now? I mean spread your palms - Oh, that? Wait! Pour now. Santosham! Grandpa, have you come even here? Grandpa, what am I grandpa Sir? - Oh, you too are here right? I got to speak something personally, you leave. Give that pot here. You go now Grandpa! Why are you calling me again? Not you man, you go from here. Here, take this and leave now. Why does he say me grandpa, did I become so old? They lick even pickle along with toddy, you know that? Enough of the pickle made by you and your grand children. You go, grandpa Santosham, listen to me son. Believe me, dear I’m here believing your grand children and came to this place believing in you. Just the name is Santosh and no happiness in life because of you all. I understand that you’re scolding my grand children, but I’d understand why only when you say the reasons, right? You didn’t understand? - No You know how was I? I was like a Lion Hi! Oh no, who are you idiot? Before death, Atma Rao and Devadas after death. Who cares whatever you are, rascal? Bro! Bro! I’m getting tortured with these souls. Damn! What’s your problem, man? Looks like you’re going somewhere in a hurry? By chance, is it a love problem? - Yes, love Oh, is she your lover or are you her lover? Why do you care? - Why don’t you say, brother? She is my lover. So, it’s one sided love. Say it fast I’ll say. You need any help from me? I don’t need anyone’s help, you first get down Time is up, I got to drop my lover at office. You know what happens if you don’t say it fast? Your lover will be someone else’s lover and you are Arya-3 then. Will you get down now or not? - Close your eyes and I’ll be gone Why didn’t you go? You didn’t shut your eyes properly Shut your eyes properly - You idiot, go away man. I don’t need the car in evening. I’ll go to the hostel along with my friends. No… Bro, it is me. She said not to come in the evening, like you were a driver. To hell with your life Varsha, one minute. Long legs, right? What again? Varsha, today... - Today? This evening... - Evening? Hey, what for you if I smoke? Did you buy for me or your dad? If I get him next time, I will burn his face with this. Waste fellow! - Ok, cool What is that idiot doing here? - What? I mean, what is that Rishi doing here? Oh, same office and I’m observing from few days. From few days… Few… Be careful with him Ok. Still, why should I care about him? Damn! - I mean… Enough of still looking, go on. If you had said it at your house with the same speed, my watchman job wouldn’t be there. I mean, we are discussing so about how to say at home. We already reached the second floor, get back to work. Let’s do it fast, dear. Let’s do after our parents agree, marriage. You cleverly escape saying about marriage. One kiss, please No, positions! You’re going too much, oh God! Hey, are you right here? Did you see my WhatsApp status? Wait dude, I’m sad as my share market isn’t good and you say about your WhatsApp status. You always torture saying share market. You remember what is tomorrow? What? It’s been six years since you kissed and proposed in grandfather’s house. Is it, shall we bunk today then? Even the share market too isn’t that good. -Bunking for me or for the share market? For the kiss - Look at the face. Hey, forgot to say. That Santosh idiot saw you. He also asked what you were doing here My foot! Move on. Hey Atmarao, program is about you - Yes, your honor Yes dude, does your souls have any feelings?

That is, listen to me bro. Let’s do as I said for now. Ok, please. My daddy is asking where I am and asking whether I haven’t slept. I feel doubtful. By chance, did that Santosh say anything? Your dad says the same every day and you don’t over imagine. Don’t talk too much, my dad doesn’t ask me daily like this. Hey, stop it Not you, but I should cry. My legs are swelling by continuously standing. When the issue here is about you both, I got trapped in between. Baby and my boy! You both enjoy your tortures and leave me. I will take up my own troubles. Bro, please bro. All the best. Ok, fine. We are now left with just one option. Grandpa! Grandpa? Yes. If we say our matter to grandpa and convince him, he’d take care of everything. We’ll go by morning flight tomorrow and return back by day after.

She is beautiful, grandpa. That was just an infatuation grandpa, mine is pure love with Varsha. Shut up and say.. - Ok, see. Hey get up! Hey get up! Bloody three feet. Sir! Thank you Sir I have no link with them Sir, just friends Friends? Sir, not even that now Sir. - Ok, are you comfortable? Comfortable! Sir! Damn!

Then what is this? - What is that? Sir, I’ve nothing to do. She trapped me Sir . No, you don’t say anything to me Santosh. I’m not accepting this...Please get out - Please Sir, I beg you Sir. Take this and squeeze if needed, Sir, It feels good - Should I squeeze? Should I squeeze this? - Yes Sir, it feels good Sir - Get lost Alright! So, why are you waiting here? Go and enjoy I named Santosh! Yeah! Thank God - Move on They’ve completely ruined my prestige that day. Some duffers at office uploaded it all on Facebook. My dad came to know about that and said I’m unfit in life for politics and here I’ve been going around for deaths and eating there. Grandson, whatever happening in life should be taken for our good. Not our good, but for my good. A good thing happened after that. I feel you’ve done a bit too much in Santosh’s matter. My foot! But why are you feeling so much for him? Not about him, but what if he goes to my parents with his parents and proposes to marry me? What if my dad agrees? They’d ask you and go ahead, right? Then say, you’d marry Rishi. They’d slap me tight. Why is that? My daddy doesn’t have a good opinion on your parents. The same would carry on even on you, right? Hey, say what exactly you wish to say. I don’t know anything. Often when your topic comes, I heard my daddy saying you people are very selfish and greedy for money. I’m thus saying he may not agree. Is it so? None can notice their own mistakes. Not just my parents but you, me and everyone knows that your daddy has money and publicity craze. Stop it now Rishi, I just posted the matter that they are thinking so. I haven’t said anything about your parents. I’ll say, I’ll say directly. It’s better that your dad brings down his blabbering. Please! Anyone would behave based on the others. Leave about my Daddy, how many times did your mummy… Damn! I know how she spoke bad about me. Don’t unnecessarily blame my parents. Oh no! After saying it all, you too are saying like your dad with a comment what have you said Hey, remember! You just said, right? We should behave based on the opposite people. You should be as per my parents after we get married. You will be in my house after we are married. Why would I be, Rishi? I’m coming to your house for you and not for them. Oh no, what now? I’ve been saying you from childhood. We should all be together after our marriage and that would be so great. We will be with my parents, right? Yes, I too will feel the same to be with my parents. But none is so now Ok, leave all that. Will you be in my house with my parents? Damn it, I can’t be with those people. Mine too is the same situation and I too can’t be. Conjuse lives eating those dishes saved in the fridge. Hey, don’t talk too much.. like you’re down from the heavens. Hey, stop it now. You and your family! Will you always be on that phone? Not me, but you. I don’t like this thing. Learn to listen when something is said for good. I can see future with you, Rishi. It won’t set for us both, get out. “Mistake or hesitation but got separated” “Pain came up in the story not written by fate” “Smile has bid a bye while leaving” “My life is gone away from me” “Just the pain is with me” “The word us has become meaningless” “Separated now as you and me” “This vacuum is my friend now” “It is in the heart as a companion” “Fun has become an insult” “I moved on as a moving surprise” “Arrow hit when left after aiming” “Will the wound at heart heal?” “My life is gone away from me” “Just the pain is with me” “My breathe turned into a cyclone” “It blew you far away in anger” “Your thoughts are shaking me” “I’ve moved around going mad” “Tears don’t listen when said not to come” “All the dreams melted and are showering” “This weeping is become my world” “It ended all my hopes” I’m just happy as they broke up and why do you come now and ask me to get them along again, grandpa? It’s better to do Mixing Lemon rice at Erragadda roads instead of making them come along. Oh no, I feel awkward remembering about that car flashback. Damn! I loved so much, grandpa. I loved your granddaughter so much that I pity myself. See, it is Varsha’s photo even in my purse. Her photo is with you all over, but she should be having your photo right? Look, you made me a fool saying such logics till now. It’s too much, enough now Santosh! Santosh! If you now believe on what I’m going to say, come home along with me. Otherwise, come for the dinner without forgetting on my 11th day. I wished to say the important incident from my life which I never shared with anyone. and then take Santosh home along with me. Because I don’t have the time now after death which I had when alive. I loved a girl when I and your grandpa studied in Hyderabad. Grandpa, love right in those days? Yes But that girl went home suddenly, giving up her studies. But still, we never stopped writing letters. When we were happy like that, she wrote saying her parents are getting her married... they aren’t caring about her word even when said and that it would be her last letter. With that I couldn’t be there, came back to our village, started a Rice Mill with the help of a few and lived happily. My family members didn’t let me be happy and got me married. Why I said they didn’t let me be happy was that even my wife didn’t stay long with me and died after some time of marriage. When I was living so, one day… - Post! I started in tension after reading that letter. I couldn’t believe myself after seeing Neelima, my love in that condition. Saying to have none to take care, Neelima handed over her daughter to me and breathed her last. From that moment, I decided to be having two children. Granddaughter of my love Neelima, Varsha and my grandson Rishi came to me and asked to get them married as they are in love. I felt my memories from old days are coming true and I somehow wished to get them together. After listening to you now... I understood that my kids effect is showing impact even on their kids. In such conditions when you say now to leave after helping so much, I feel my life so far is a waste. Because I always winning when alive... am losing now after death like this and my soul is weeping for the same, grandson! You won’t lose grandpa, don’t say so. I understood what to do. Come on, let’s go home Grandpa, you are a love failure and I too am a love failure. Murali, priest said to get in at the mill. Nothing should go wrong in what is being done for Raju Careful. Where were you for the whole day, yesterday? Say that we had toddy - No, do we say all that to him? What man, behaving mad? Did you drink or what? No father in law, I just went around the village. I didn’t drink It’s smelling, go and brush - Ok, I will brush You are saved as my father in law expired. -Oh, he’s just leaving. He’s gone. Where are you going? We are going to disperse father in law’s ashes. We will come tomorrow Rest in peace What, rest in peace? - Oh, happy journey Go uncle, go - You rascal Are you ready, grandpa? Enough of that feeling, did you think of anything in this gap? Yes, I’m thinking how to start the same. You know the present range of your grand children now? You won’t understand if I say like this, wait let me show you in practical now. This is Varsha’s toy and as per our narration, this is a time bomb. I’ll keep this there, you see how it blasts. Hey! Come on! See now. Hey, what are you doing? Do you have any sense? Why are you touching mine? It was me who bought it for you. Is it? You bought this for me? Then, I’ll tear it out and… Grandpa, what you saw was just the first half. Now comes the second half, see. Varsha... What is this? Hole, can’t you see? Don’t talk like a kid as if you don’t know. I’m asking why did you do it. Hey, look at the hole. It came very even, right? Stop all these dirty plays and say why you did it My laptop and it’s my wish - What? Bill is mine. I’ll hit with this if you talk too much. Hey, I’ll press your neck and kill. You hit me with the laptop? You think I can’t press? - You… You... scratched me. - You said the toy was yours right, idiot? It’ll be the same If you say me idiot again, I’ll - Hey stop it It’s become a job for me to always stop when you and your parents are into fight. Be good at least till they are back Why are they worst than their parents? Oh, you didn’t like my love story and they are like Romeo and Juliet for you. Yes man, go and remind them about their love once. Don’t know about reminding them, but I remember my love story. You know, my love story is of Arjun Reddy range. My foot! Go and say to marry my granddaughter. What grandpa, won’t you let me be good? Your entire family is using me like the stuff in drink session. The guy doing what he says is the leader. Yes, I’ll become a politician as and when you say? Such dirty tricks won’t work on me. Hello! Oh no, emotion! Is this emotional blackmail? Hello! Don’t put that face grandpa, I’ll go and say. My laptop. Head phones Thanks - Pleasure What? Varsha! Varsha - Yes, tell me. Will you marry me? Super! I said so as you broke up with him. Come on, go and marry him. No, don’t hit Brother in law, you wait . - No problem, no need. It's ok. I’ll marry you. You go and convince my father. Are you crack? I meant, is it so. Dirty rascal is laughing even when I said to marry. Brother in law, wait. Open the door. Grandpa, is your granddaughter crack? She says to marry me. What, you? - Yes, me I’ll be banged being in between them now. Hey, stop rascal - Oh no You are dead in my hands today - What rascal, what? What shall I do with them, man? Why do you care about whom I marry? - Yes, why do I care? He’s correct for you, marry him. Yes, we should do the same when idiots like you cheat. Who cheated you? You said it, right? Your future is visible and next… You say we shall be just like cousins? What all did you say then? Didn’t you say me nonsense? I’ll say when you say me. Oh, is it? What did you say when my parents asked about marriage, recently? When my parents made me sit the day before and said we get the mill by marrying you, I said no as I didn’t like that. You are shouting like a buffalo without knowing all that Hey, if you say me buffalo… Yes. I heard my dad saying about mill with my mom They’re getting us married for property and not for us. Sorry, dear. you too say sorry. I love you. Why is the atmosphere so silent Yes grandpa, it shouldn’t be like this. By mistake did they stab each other and die? Come on grandpa, let’s go and see. Close the door, our plan is a success. Thank God, one job is done - Thank God, one problem is cleared Yes, right! - Yes, right! Grandpa, you’d have finished a full bottle if alive today, right? Come on grandson, I’m always in two pegs… - Two What happened? We forgot about that Kothem fellow in hurry - Who is that Kothem fellow? Come on, I’ll show you. I’ll be gone till the mill and come back dear - Brother, have breakfast and go. Rishi! They were fighting even just before, brother. Our Raju would’ve felt so happy seeing you both, like this. No idea how much you took by asking grandpa to get you married... but he took it up as his last wish to somehow get you married. But... finally he passed away without seeing your marriage. Why do you see so, master? Drink it fast. I should drink here, when you drink there. That means you... He is in the same position from when Raju sir died, sir. He places a glass in front and asks to drink and he drinks it too again. Hey, go Hey, will your master be happy by sitting here and drinking? Or will he feel happy by celebrating his 11th day well? I can’t come to the house without master. Why, isn’t anybody home if he isn’t there? Everyone is asking about you there. Whoever has asked, it was just him for me. I can’t come, Sir. In the process to set right my kids, I forgot you being like my son. Please forgive me, Kothem. When he’s feeling like a son about you, you like a waste fellow are sitting here and drinking. Are you not from this village, sir? I don’t understand what you are saying Let’s think of that after going home. Come on You move now, come on move - I won’t come Help me grandpa! Oh, you can’t help, right? Everything went on well, mother in law. Sir, have it. - Hey Kothem, where were you all these days? He came this morning. When asked where he was, he stood silent just like this. Grandpa. They are so good with dad’s photo, right? -Good if they agree for the marriage All these are saying it’s good if you agree for marriage, by seeing you. Why don’t you think a bit about that? We like it. You won’t start a new mess again, right? We aren’t agreeing for you, but for grandpa. Our Somaraju’s dream is coming true. Don’t let the 11th day of the guy who always lived in smiles and made others smile, being in tears. Let’s celebrate it as a festival and give farewell with satisfaction. This is the story of my soul. When my family is thinking to celebrate my 11th day in grandeur, I’m going to see from close. You too join me “Human’s birth is great” “One has to be gone back again” “Life in between runs like a story” “In the life journey on the earth” “So many roles on the way ahead” “Your story becomes past history in this journey and becomes sacred” “It’s a great pain when our close ones pass away” “We can’t change the fate and Bhagavad-Gita is finally played” “To fulfil the bond, to get closer and to end this” “Celebration carried out at the place where you lived on” “All should come together and give mourning” “Life is the puppet game with smiles and tears” “Either we salute or put garlands” “It shows you stand in our hearts” “Either we offer food or do the final rites” “It shows we remember your hunger” “The water with sesame seeds being dropped” “Are the final farewell for you” “Memories won’t be gone, eyes are wet remembering you” “You are in our hearts alive forever” “The celebration being done at the place you lived on” “All should come together and give mourning” “Life is the puppet game with smiles and tears” You witnessed my happiness, right? I reading and smiling the text saying even death is similar to the marriage... When my death is celebrated like a festival and are sending me away happily... I’ll go happily witnessing the happiness of my beloved ones. What more do a man like me need than this? Dad always used to make us laugh. Do you remember, Papa? In childhood, once we were studying power was gone. Dad took great risk, lit a big fire and asked us to study in that light. Power came in immediately and we should have seen dad’s face then. He didn’t let us study that day in anger after that What happened, brother in law? You know what your father did? Look... I’m taking this decision with the feeling that my kids are happy with what I gave them. Rice Mill starting as mine came this far as ours. So, I feel this is the hard work from many hands and feel them also as my family... I considering my kids, grandchildren and the labor, I’m giving equal rights to one and all. Importantly, I’d say all are equal share holders and none has a right to sell it. This is the document I’m writing in stable mental and health condition with my own hands. Finally... You know what he did with this house? It seems this house is for him and we are all waste fellows. I haven’t written like that - That means... It seems he’ll be in this house... and we shall come during festivals here and leave having good dinners. Let’s go and ask what exactly the matter is That lawyer fellow has informed me about all this. Anyone would write concentrating on the pen he writes... but this old man wrote all this nonsense being in drink brother in law. You first say what you did. Don’t spread the matter to be told as a good deed like a poison to all. You wait mom, you know nothing. We, not having the time to take care of the mill thought to sell the rice mill for Rishi and Varsha’s marriage. What uncle... running to close the doors as your friend’s prestige shouldn’t be gone? You don’t care about what happens to us and our children. If you really can’t listen to my words, remove that machine in ears uncle. Sir, master wrote like that means... - Hey... You too are getting to talk after knowing that the house is for you? I already said we won’t get these properties with us, right? Why not send away grandpa happily? Shut up. Murali! Why do you care about them, grandson? It is proved that they are idiots, right? Those who still wish to talk can silent get out, opening the doors. Sir, it’s getting late and the rites need to be done faster. If you feel that we are the reason for all this, we’d never come again towards this house. Look, let’s discuss all these later. It is getting late, come on son, come. Oh! When we are in so much pain and if you still feel his final rites are important, then move on.. Come on ... - Dad, dad stop What was grandpa’s mistake? - Mistake! He made you, me and all on the roads. On the roads means not to give that mill? Hey Rishi, all this is for you right? Why are you shouting? What to shout? Yes, all this is for me. You get us both married if said to give the mill and show affections among yourselves? If that isn’t there, you say not to go to mother in law’s house, not to talk saying they cry seeing our status? What mother in law, you cry seeing our status? I and Varsha are in love from childhood. Yes, when you are in such behaviours why would we say you? That’s why we asked grandpa to get us married. But, we witnessed all your dramas before agreeing for our marriage. Yes, my dad always used to scold father in law and mother in law. Damn! You said to get me married to Santosh brother in law as he has more money and now saying to give me to Rishi. No idea what you do to me by getting more money in future. Hey, what are you talking - Stop this Though you were creating so much mess all these days, I kept quiet for my dad as I’m not his own daughter... They would hate if I still keep quiet. If you wish to say even a word to my father, I’d think to have only a daughter from now. Oh, then you and your daughter die right here. Hey, is your grandpa more than us for you as he said ok for your marriage? So, whatever we did thinking about your future is all a waste? I don’t say waste. I’m saying that you are just giving us the money but not people. Hey Rishi, you’ll have no value without having that money. Is it? Day before, I and Chandraiah grandpa went to invite everyone in the village for this day The respect I got there as Somaraju’s grandson, none would give that to you or me in the city, dad. Who are you and who am I, if grandfather is not there? Hey... your grandpa taught you to speak great. Then, you stay back here and do whatever you want. We are leaving. Come on. Murali... - Brother I’ll do the offerings for grandpa Hey Rishi, stop - Stop son. Stop -Stop Rishi It’s all over What I need is not that small offering from them. But, my entire family to be together Anyone living in imagination that his children are very happy can never leave the world in peace and cross river 'Vaitharani'. Grandpa... I’m getting to cry seeing you like this. You are a lucky man, dear. If I get a chance to be alive for five minutes... I wish to cry like my tears are visible. Rishi, stop. Rishi, what you are doing is wrong. When dad isn’t doing the offerings to grandpa, what’s wrong that I offer as his grandson? Priest Sir, please start. You shouldn’t do this when your father is alive, son. No problem, please go on. (Chants) Hey Rishi! You know what you are doing? Hey, get up and come, we shall go (Chants) Rishi.... See brother in law, all here are watching not saying that what Rishi is doing is wrong. It is a waste for us to be here. Move. Please, you don’t talk. The minute you spoke bad about our Raju Sir, you are no more the son in law for our village. Latha, come on let’s go. There’s none to understand us here. Even the dogs in the village will bark seeing us after this. Hey, instead of doing so and ruining our prestige, do the offerings with your own hands... even for us and then happily enjoy with the whole village. We brought you up with great care, son. We always thought about you. Is this what you give finally to us? You are feeling bad that I’m doing offerings like this in front of us. How much more would grandpa be feeling for what you did? Do the offerings now, Rishi. Do it for all of them. Well done Murali. Somaraju boasted to all in village about his children. He should get the same today and this is correct. Offerings should be done for all those in that photo. With that, all of us in this village will think Somaraju’s family doesn’t exist anymore. Correct, you said it great grandpa I understand though I’m not from your family. After watching you all from close for so long, I did this thinking how much pain did he get with what you did? Yes! True! As said by the priest, if brother’s soul was around here till the 11th day... no idea how much bad is brother feeling after seeing it all, happening here. Murali... you may not understand now. But, this will haunt you lifelong after understanding. Money is with us as long as we are alive. None knows to whom it goes after we die. Hey... one should understand his parents. And if you misunderstand them, they have no reason even to give you the birth. This offering is the last food we serve to the parents. If they can’t eat that happily, they can’t cross river 'Vaitharani'. Murali! Daddy! Daddy! (Chants) One final request to all of you. If you can bring up your children to be the same as you are with them... you too will go with full satisfaction at soul to heavens like me. I take leave.
