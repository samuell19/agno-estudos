[male narrator] This is a dramatization of a true story. In the grey, early hours of Monday, August 1st, 1966 while the city of Austin, Texas, slept a senseless rampage of crime was about to be committed against the entire community. Charles Whitman, a young student and policeman Ramiro Martinez had never met. On this day, their lives were on a collision course. [intense music] [music continues] [indistinct radio chatter] [music continues] [music continues] [puppy whining] [sighs] [puppy whining] [indistinct radio chatter] Marie. [telephone ringing] [telephone ringing] How's it going, Martinez? Hi, Wayne. [telephone continues ringing] Son? Mama. Son.. What are you doing here at this hour? It's past midnight. Charlie.. ...what is it? Nothing, mama. I'm fine. How are you feelin'? Fine. - Will you please tell me-- - Mama, could I have a.. A coke or something? Something to drink? Sure. Charlie. What is goin' on? Oh.. [sobbing] 'Oh!' [intense music] [indistinct chattering] How you doin', Ramiro? What's it like out there? Dark. Oh, thanks. Now I'm ready for anything. Ramiro, are you gonna be there Sunday? I don't know. Why? Because we got a game Sunday, that's why. - Who with? - The deejays from KLEV. What? Again? Get the car checked out, C.T. It's been knocking like crazy again. What's the matter with you, Ramiro? Don't you know it's an honor to ride in a official Austin Police department automobile? Hey, you guys gonna be there or not? I don't know, I promised Vinni I'd do some work around the house. Well, I'm gonna promise you right now that I ain't taking this job next year. - 'I'm tired of this.' - Hey.. Any of you guys seen my flashlight around here? Getting you guys out there is like herding cattle on foot. Do I get to start out in left? Are you trying to bribe me, Ramiro? That's your first holdout, Davis. Hey, you told me I was gonna start off in the left. Shut up, Woody! Take it easy, Timmy. I'll be there. Okay? Yeah. [dramatic music] [dog barking in distance] [engine revs] Fred, you know that kid Martinez 'he's been working his tail off' 'to make the grade. Now, couldn't you--' Now, don't you start in on me, Elwood. If there's anything I could do, I'd have done it. Well, I know this really isn't in my department. But, uh, that kid Martinez has been working with me. He's a real fine boy, you know. That's right, Elwood. It's not your department. Okay, captain. Alright, let's go. Let's get moving here. Martinez, uh, hang around a minute, will you? I wanna talk to you before you go home. Alright, gentlemen, get your note-pads out. Rupert, Gillian, Jones.. ...note your changes on the board. Check for your mail. Pick up your subpoenas. 'The, uh, R.C. Harris' are out of town.' 'They, uh, request a periodic check.' '3749, Project Street.' Woody, uh, stop by the chief's office. Pick up your flashlight. You left it in the john. [laughter] Okay, that's all. Go keep the city safe. Alright. Here's the roll call, lieutenant. Hey, Timmy, you want me to play left field for you? How was your night? Dull, sticky and hot. [chuckles] Unbelievable, isn't it? - Yes, sir. - How's your wife? Fine. Thank you, sir. When's she due? November. [sighs] I, um...I've got the promotion sheets here. They came in this afternoon. Yes, sir. Gillian and Jones get to sergeant. They'll be notified tomorrow. Yes, sir. I'm sorry, Ramiro. Tough luck. Maybe next time. May I go home now? I'm off duty tomorrow. - Yeah, go home. - Yes, sir! [latch rattling] [instrumental music] Hi, Ramiro. Oh, hi, Bush. What are you doing back here, Mano? Hey, I asked you a question. Que te importa? Did they book you? Don't they always? What happened? Nothin'. I wanna help you, Mano. I've known you and your folks a long time now. So you know my folks. - Ey, come on-- - They were dirt farmers. They always worked their whole life for these gringos. What good did it do 'em? You tell me that, huh? That's the easy way out, isn't it, Mano? Huh? You can blame it all on them, right? Well, what else is there? For one thing, you can start acting like a man. Now you got a job to do, you go out and do it. That's the only way you'll make changes. You guys make me laugh, Martinez. Hey, w-why don't you talk to the rest of the force? You know? I bet they'd listen to you. You, you can.. You can tell 'em, "Hey, fellas.. "Lay off off Mano. He's a good boy. He's a Mexican, like me." - Shut up! - Yeah, that will do it. You talk to 'em, Martinez. Tell them for me. They'll listen to you. You're a cop with a gun and a badge and everything. - They respect you. - I said, shut up! That's enough! Is he giving you trouble? No, it's alright. [instrumental music] [dog barking] [keys clacking] Hey, thanks again. I'll see y'all at work tomorrow. - Good night.. - Good night. Charlie? I'm home, honey. Charlie? [sighs] Oh, Charlie, I talked to Mr. Joseph today about approving my transfer. Charlie? Charlie? [instrumental music] [intense music] [sobbing] [gasping] [exhales sharply] Ramiro. [Vinni] 'Ramiro?' 'Ramiro?' I was dreaming. I woke myself up. You feel better now? You should go back to bed. I was worried about you. Well, that's your job, lady. That's what I pay you to do. What are you doing still up? Just thinking. About what? Just thinking. Come to bed. I will, in a minute. Now. In a minute. Now. Okay. Okay. [instrumental music] [puppy whining] [Charlie] To whom it may concern. I don't quite understand what is compelling me to type this note. I have been having terrible fears and violent impulses. I have had tremendous headaches. I've been going to a psychiatrist and I've come under the conclusion that the world is not worth living in. The time has come for me to face my problems. To fight them out alone. 1:30 a.m., mother already dead. 3:00 a.m., wife dead. [dog barking] [instrumental music] Got a nice price on that weapon, son. Make yourself a good deal. Ain't another store in the States got a-- I'll take this one here. Yes, sir. Bought one of these myself back about a few years ago. Fella I knew once used to have one of these. He used to-- Let me see that carbine over there. Yes, sir. Thirty caliber, semi-automatic M-1 carbine. Clip-fed, sturdy, can't beat it for light game. One of the most diff.. Hey, you look like you can handle that. I'll need about half a dozen clips and 600 rounds. Yes, sir. My boy Tim went after a wild boar last week. Up in that open country, a few miles north of here. Says it's good hunting. 'Of course, I don't know what you're looking for.' What do I owe you? Well, uh.. Let's just add it up while you.. ...fill out the form here. [chuckles] 'You got yourself quite a bundle.' [children clamoring] [water sprinkling] [sink water sloshing] Oh, come on, will you? This is miserable. Honey, can we get this darned sink worked over sometime? Ramiro? [telephone rings] Yeah. Hey, Julio, what's happening? Hey, take it easy. Look, I'm, I'm sorry. I-I forgot to call. Yeah, I-I've been busy around here all morning. You know, day off, a million gotta be done. No, I didn't get it. Look, how should I know? I didn't get it, alright? Look, uh, I appreciate the offer, Julio. But I think it's too early for that. Okay. Alright, alright. Adios. Uh.. Julio.. [exhales] Let's have lunch next week and we'll talk about it. Okay. Right. So, what did he say? Did he offer you the job again? [sighs] Did anybody say anything about a job? Then why did he call? He wanted to have lunch with me next week. Is there any law against that? Is that okay with you, huh? You didn't get sergeant. That's what's bothering you, isn't it? Do you want to quit? I don't know. I'm thinking about it. Last night, I woke up so frightened. I just lay there and I stare at the ceiling and I wait for that door to open. I'm not the one who loves the work you do, Ramiro. [horn honking] Sir, may I help you? I'm sorry but you can't 'take that up there without permission.' Who's in there? Nobody, now. They're at lunch. But you still can't take that up on the observation deck. Alright, you go on down. Don't you come back. Not if your life means anything to you. [thudding] [grunts] [panting] [breathing heavily] [keys jingle] And that's what he said, exactly that way. And then he shut the door right in my face. Well, ain't you gonna do nothin'? Lord knows what he's up to. Floyd and Kibb. Go up there and see what's going on. - Alright. - Yes, sir. [indistinct chatter] Hold your breath so your ears don't pop. Captain? Yeah, it's just like she said. There's this big guy. And he's got a whole pile of guns out there. Don't take any chances. I'm gonna call the city police in on this. You two get down here and seal all of the elevators. Don't let anybody up. You understand? Yes, sir. Hey, everybody, this way. - You sure? - 'Sure, I'm sure.' - 'I was here last year.' - Oh, that's right. - Come on. - Come on, Alex. Wait a minute. Wait for me. Come on, Dolores. Come on, daddy. Right behind you, Barbara. Go ahead. There it is. Curtis, come on, now. Oh-oh! Be careful. Don't hurt him, Alex. Oh, this is great! [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter] Hi. [gunfire] - Dolores? Dolores? - Oh, mama. Mama! - Oh, my God! - What's happened, Felix? Why don't you answer me? - 'Oh, my God.' - Dolores.. I'll get help. Help me! Help me, please! They've killed my, my family! They've killed me! They've killed them! Oh, my God! There's a man up there, with a gun. - He shot at us for no reason. - We'd better not wait here-- We can't use the stairs. We've got injured people here. We'll hide in one of the offices. Hurry. [sobbing] [dramatic music] [cocks rifle] [intense music] [gunshots] [indistinct chatter] Hey! This guy is dead! Oh, my God! [indistinct chatter] [female #1] This guy's been shot at. What happened? He's dead! [indistinct chatter] [cocks rifle] [gunfire] [people screaming] [gunfire continues] [glass shattering] [glass shattering] [people screaming] Hey, what's the hell's going on? There's a guy up there in the tower. - He's shooting people. - What? Hey, do you hear that? That guy says there's somebody up in the tower shooting down. 'Must be something to it. Look at all the commotion.' If there is, we're okay here. We're way out of range. [gunshot] [gunshots] [glass shattering] [screaming] [indistinct police radio chatter] [gunshots] Sniper in the tower up there! Car four to headquarters. There's a sniper in the university tower. He's firing on the campus and we've got casualties. Send all available units and medical aid. Fast. [gunshots] [siren wailing] [gunshots] I've already talked to the university people. They don't know what the hell's goin' on either. Okay, I'll keep you posted. Woody Young just called in from the campus. He's one of the first one's over there. Says that place looks like a damn battlefield. Let's get some more patrol units out there. I've already dispatched every available unit. Reserves, too. Call the rangers, see if they can help. They're on their way along with the FBI and the secret service. - Secret service? - 'Captain.' It's the hospital on the line. They're swamped with casualties. They wanna know if we can loan 'em some of our vehicles. Tell them to call the local mortuaries. - Borrow their automobiles. - Alright. Wait a minute, fellas. Now, what are we talking about? FBI, secret service.. The last thing we need is more confusion. Now why don't we find out exactly what's goin' on out there before we call in half the federal government? We got us a sniper, Elwood. You know what means? 'That means the newspapers, the television people' and half the people in the country are going to be watching what we do here, today. Now, let's, uh, go out to that campus and set up some kinda command post. - Now, that won't be easy. - Why not? Well, apparently where he's up there has got some pretty long-range equipment. He's hitting people three or four blocks away. Damn it! There must be some place that's out of range. - Frank. - Yes, sir. You call special weapons. We want some fire power out there. - Right. - Let's go. [siren blaring] [Don] 'We can't get any closer than this.' Nobody can. I mean, this place is totally crazy. Everybody's running in different directions. Let's get the preliminaries out of the way first. Now you make sure that somebody there stays in touch with the police station. I'll pick up some interviews later. Okay. Give me a couple minutes to set up. 'About ready, Don?' Look, stand right there, I need to get a light reading of you. No. Forget me. Keep the camera on that tower. Zoom in as close as you can and keep it there. [clamoring] [gunshots] [people screaming] [gunfire] [bullets ricochet] [gunfire continues] [indistinct chatter] [man on radio] 'At least one person was reported dead' 'and several others wounded.' 'There's no way to confirm those reports' 'as the shooting continues continues all around us.' 'The sniper or snipers are apparently located ' 'on the top observation deck of the university tower' 'some 300 feet above the ground.' 'Police have issued a warning for all persons' 'to stay away from the university area' 'and to remain inside whenever possible.' 'KTNS News will bring you further details' 'as they become available.' 'We now return you to our newsroom.' What are you going to do? I'm going to call. They'll need everybody they can get. This is Officer Ramiro Martinez. Let me talk to Lieutenant Lee. [female phone operator] 'I'm sorry, his line's busy.' 'All lines are caught up right now.' No, this is official business. Break in. 'Yes, sir. I'll try.' [man on radio] 'For those of you who've just joined us' 'let me bring you up to date.' Lieutenant, line four. Lieutenant Lee. Uh, lieutenant, Martinez. Where do you want me? You're off duty, aren't you? Where do you want me? Campus. I'll be there in 15 minutes. You're off duty. Nobody would blame you if you didn't go. [siren blaring] Why have I felt this, Ramiro? All day, I felt something coming. [Ramiro] 'Vinni, please.' I can't help it. You want me just stand here and say nothing. I've had this feeling that something terrible is going to happen. It'll be okay. I gotta hurry up. Two hours ago you were going to quit. What happened to that? Just stay here and wait. It won't be that long. They want guys to direct traffic and get civilians out of the area. That's all I am going to do. [engine revs] [children laughing] [sirens blaring] [tires screeching] People, get back. Everybody inside. Let's go. Go. [siren blaring] [man on radio] 'It's unbelievable.' 'A disaster area. That's-that's the only term for it.' 'It is now estimated that within the last 20 minutes' 'since the shooting began, some 32 people have been hit.' 'At least 10 are reported dead.' [gunfire] [clamoring] [siren blaring] [gunfire] [tires screeching] What do you see? Just some little old puff of smoke. [gunfire continues] [siren blaring] [indistinct chatter] [tires screeching] C.T.! C.T.! [siren blaring] [gunfire continues] [sirens blaring] [gunfire] What's going on? How the hell should I know? [gunfire continues] Where did these people come from with all these guns? [siren blaring] [tires screeching] [indistinct chatter] What happened, Tim? Alright, we're shooting right there. And we got it covered, right? And then all of a sudden, Woody says, "I'm hit." Blap! He got Woody. Now, Ramiro, I wanna know how can somebody shoot like that. I mean, he's shootin' kids, women, anybody. And we can't reach him! - Tim, where are the others? - What others? - The others? Where are they? - They're all over. Well, who's in command? Nobody is in command. Ramiro, I'm tellin' you we can't make range with those damn popguns. That's what Woody kept sayin', "I can't reach him." But he reaches us. He's reachin' everything. Partner, we got a real problem. [gunfire continues] [indistinct chatter] Doctor. Doctor. [indistinct radio chatter] Just talk to the hospital, captain. They're running out of beds. They've got a disaster plan, doctor. Tell them to implement it right away. They already have. Well, then there's nothing I can do. We're doing everything we can. Fred, we gotta find out who's up there. What we've got to do, Elwood, is we got to get him down. Don't make any difference who it is then. Yeah, I keep trying to think about that. But the question keeps comin' up. Why? Why would anybody do that? He's gotta be a psycho. Somebody off the edge. Well, then we gotta find out who. When we do that, then maybe we can find a mother or a sweetheart or a friend. Somebody to talk him down. Be a lot cleaner, captain. This is one hell of a time to start launching an investigation. Oh, Fred, every man has got a name and he's got a face and, and a reason why he does things. 'May not make sense to you or me.' But let me try. I'm not doing any good just sitting around here. Alright. Go ahead, but stay away from that campus. Don't worry. Think he can do any good? Oh, I don't know. Maybe. Lee, uh, try to find out how many officers are over at campus, and who. Uh, unit four, unit four, this is an emergency. [Fred] 'We've got to get some men up in that tower.' Unit four, unit four, this is an emergency. [gunfire] [bullets ricochet] No one knows where all these men came from. But all of a sudden, here they were.. ...pulling hunting rifles out of their car trunks pitching in to help the police. [gunfire] Grab his feet. I'll help you. [gunfire continues] [groaning] [engine revving] [breathing heavily] [siren blaring] How many you brought in? Three so far. I reached two more, but they were dead. No point wasting time on them. Ready? I guess so. Let's go. [man on radio] 'The firing is so intense' 'that the police have been unsuccessful in their attempts' 'to mount an assault on the tower.' 'It is been reported from the evacuation center' 'that at least ten people are dead' 'and an uncertain number are wounded.' 'We now have a further update from Don Wallace, on the scene.' 'Stand by.' [Don] 'From where we are, we can see' 'numerous bodies lying all around.' 'We have no way of knowing how seriously they are injured.' 'But we have seen numerous attempts' 'by the police and medical personnel' 'to drag the wounded to safety.' [sighs] [bullets ricochet] [gunfire] Officer. How long you people been here? Ever since this started. What's your name? Allen Crum. I work here at the university bookstore. Mr. Crum, stay here with that thing. Now don't you try to do anything crazy. You understand? Uh, ex-excuse me, officer. I know a way to get up into that tower. Now.. ...uh, you see the.. You see the building right over there? - Right over there? - Mm-hm. Now, if we could get there I can show you a way up there. A passageway. I was in the air force for 12 years. And I-I-I do know how to use this. You ever see any action? No. Not until today. - Okay. - Uh, excuse me. Mrs. Greenly, I'm going with the officer here. You'll, you'll be alright. Now, you people just stay here. You'll be alright. You understand? Just stay back here. - You ready? - Yes, sir. Let's go. [gunfire continues] Yeah, how long will it take you to get here? Mama, I have to find someone to stay with Janice. Now, either you come over, or I'll find someone else. Because I'm going! That's all there is to it. Ihaveto go. Are you coming or not? Then hurry, mama. Please, God, hurry. - You hurt? - No. I'm just scared. I've been here since it started. I'm afraid to move. Well, you're better off here. What's happening? Well, just stay put. And keep your head down. [gunfire continues] [panting] [sirens blaring] [Frank] 'Put him over here.' 'More stretchers.' We need more blankets and stretchers. Frank, even get Joe Delvy on the phone over at Georgetown airport. Tell him I wanna talk to him. Listen to this, "The receptionist "at the tower, Mrs. Lannex first reported the sniper to campus security." They confirmed that report. She described the man has-- Captain? Captain, I got Joe Delvy on the phone. Alright, uh, just a.. Just a second, huh, Elwood? Thanks, Frank. Joe! You know what's going on over here, you heard about it. Now listen, you think you could fly somebody over that tower? You're willing to try it? Alright. Thanks, Joe. I'll have a man over there in 15 minutes. Well, anyway, she described him as tall, husky, 25 years old. That description could fit a thousand guys in this town. Right, okay. But how many of them spent the morning lugging around an-an arsenal of weapons? - Lee? - Yeah. What about the National Guard? I'd take hours to round up a platoon. They're scattered all over the state. Alright, the hell with them. Don't try to reach them anymore. We'll try to settle this thing ourselves. Now I got this all worked out-- Uh, what about the weapons? Any sniper scopes, uh, machine guns? Not gonna do any good, sir. It's gonna be too hard to reach him no matter what we do. There must be a hundred civilians over there taking pot shots at that tower and they got better weapons than we have. Tell that to the bleeding hearts who want to take guns away from the people. What the hell are you talking about anyway? Just how do you think our friend up there got those guns to begin with? Now, Frank didn't mean anything. Well now, that sniper was sure to be observed by somebody around town today, Fred. I've got my men checking everywhere. Elwood, there's a man up in that tower and he's killing people. Now you keep checking. Alright, we'll check in the sporting goods shops the gun stores, we're bound to come up with something. Fine, fine, but I want you to understand. If we get a chance at him with or without talking him down first we're going to go in there and blast hell out of him. Now, you do understand that don't you? Okay. Lee. Joe, uh, Delvy over at the Georgetown airport says he's wiling to fly one of our people over and maybe, uh, get a shot at the sniper. From a plane? Crop-duster. It's possible. It's something anyway. - Okay, I'm on my way. - No, no. - I don't want you to go. - Now, captain, look.. - Now listen, no way. - Look.. I'm the most experienced man here. And I'm the best shot. Now, let me do it. Alright, go! But for God sake, be careful up there. [engine revving] And he fits the description we have? [female #2] 'Yes.' - What time this morning? - '9:50 a.m.' Okay, give me the address, I'll get right on over there. - '1549 Central Boulevard.' - That's it. Got it. In the meantime, you keep checking every other gun shop in town. - 'Yes, sir.' - Right. I'll get back to you. [breathing heavily] [radio static] [man on radio] 'The firing has stopped.' 'And for the first time, Austin has settled down' 'into a temporary, if uneasy peace.' 'We can only watch and wait to see what is going to happen.' 'I think we will take advantage of this opportunity' 'to improve our camera position.' [grunts] Oh, my God. It's stopped again. We've, we've got to get him out of here. How? He's hurt. Can't you see that? He needs a doctor. What about Curtis? You...you help me carry him out. The shooting has stopped. We can't do that, Walter. We've got to do it. There are people lying everywhere. I can't stand here any longer. I've got to get help. Don't go out there, Walter. Please. [gunfire] [glass shattering] [engine sputtering] [gunfire] [engine revving] [tapping] [gunfire continues] Is she hurt bad? - You know her? - No. I assume she's about seven or eight months pregnant. Took a hit right in the midsection. Is that bad enough for ya? Officer, you gonna get up there and get him, huh? You gonna stop him? [engine droning] [sirens blaring] [indistinct chatter] [gunfire] [no audio] Oh, look! [indistinct chatter] [gunfire] [gunfire] [no audio] [gunshot] [gunfire] [bullets ricochet] [gunfire continues] [gunfire] Back into the other room! Back into the other room! Everybody. - Up against the wall! - What's going on? Up against the wall and out of line of fire! Now, is anybody hurt? It's alright, nobody's been shot. Please, listen to me, please! Now, I'm going into the tower. Officer, you've got to get us out of here! I can't stand it any longer! Please! You're safe here, ma'am. Now just stay back and out of sight, all of you! Now, I'm going into the tower. We've got to get up to him in order to stop all this. 'Now, you're safe here. I promise you.' Now, just stay back, all of you. [gunfire] [panting] He'll never make it. - He'll never make it. - Lord, don't let him be hit. [gunfire continues] Okay. Let's get in that building, huh? Now! [male #1] 'What can I do for you?' I guess you've heard what's going on, sir. 'Course. It's all over the radio. Now, you told the officer who phoned that there was a young man who came in here this mornin', sir? That's right, about, uh, 10:00 a.m. What did he look like? Well, like I told the office who called I don't pay much attention to the customers look. Oh, he's a big kid and short hair. Nice-looking. Do you know him? You ever seen him in here before? Hey, I told you. I didn't pay that much attention. Didn't think it was funny maybe? A man comes in here and buys enough ammunition to start World War III? Look, lieutenant, I don't choose the customers. A man walks in here, wants a weapon, we sell him one. If he wants two, we sell him two. - There's no law against it. - Okay, okay. Did you at least get him to fill out the registration forms? Yes, sir. That's the law. Would you mind getting them for me? Is there anything else I can do for you, lieutenant? Yeah. You know, there were a lot of people killed out there this morning, my friend. You think about that, huh? Hey, it's not myfault. I didn't know the guy was gonna kill anyone. [gunfire] [breathing heavily] [foghorn blaring in distance] Hey, Timmy, how'd you get in here? - Utility tunnel. - There's Ramiro. Hey, Ramiro, are you alright? Yeah, I'm alright. Well, looks like we all made it o-okay. Well, what are we gonna do now? There may be still some people on top. I think we oughta go up and get them out. Where's the nearest telephone in this building? It's right over there. You'll have trouble getting through. 'I tried a while ago and the lines were all jammed.' What do you wanna do? Try to get through to Ambrose. Maybe they've got some ideas. I think we oughta get upstairs. Yes, sir. I think we should. We've got to try to get through. We've got to know what the hell's going on outside. We'll have to do this ourselves. I think we better get upstairs. And do what? We don't have a plan. We don't even know who's up there. You guys go up and check for victims. Don't do anything else. I'm gonna try to get through. How long are we supposed to wait? Look, C.T., either I get through or I don't. And it's not gonna take me that long. 'Just wait.' Okay, okay. Come on, let's go. Alright. I understand. Alright, father, go up to that apartment and open it. Kick the door open if you have to. But get it open. I'll be there in ten minutes. [automated message] 'All university phone circuits are in use at this time.' 'This is a recording.' Oh, Fred. We got it. Here it is. Boy's name is Whitman, Charles Whitman. 'He's a student at the university.' How do you know it's him? Well, we found his mother's body twenty minutes ago at her apartment. And there's a priest. There's a Father Davidson. He's over at the Whitman apartment now. Now, apparently, Whitman called in sick for both he and his wife this morning. But there's nobody answering the door now. Are you sure you got the right man? Fred, that boy didn't have sense enough to write a phony name on his registration card when he bought the guns. There it is, Whitman. Alright, Elwood, but I want you to know that some of our men got in the tower. You want a chance at talkin' him down you better get back here awful fast. Right. Get back, ma'am. [thudding] [sighs] Didn't realize you were coming up. This is the way up there. I think we oughta.. Where's C.T.? They're checking back there. Wait a minute, Ramiro, I think we oughta make sure this floor's empty first. [banging on door] Open the door! It's the police! Open up! There's somebody in there. Open up the door! It's the police, come on! [Father Davidson] 'Then he began telling me about his studies' 'in structural engineering.' 'About stress as a physical force.' 'He talked about this bridge' somewhere in the Northwest, I think it was that started swaying with the rhythm of the wind. And then the stresses kept building up.. ...until finally, it collapsed. It's just not easy to believe that it's Charles Whitman up there, lieutenant. How long did you know him? He first came to me four, maybe five months ago. He was troubled. He wanted to talk. That's not uncommon with a young man his age. Not uncommon at all. But I didn't think that he was.. ...dangerous or anything like that. "Tonight, I killed my mother. '"If there's a heaven, she's going there.' "If not, she's out of her pain and misery. "I intend to kill my wife... after she get's home. '"Don't want her to face the embarrassment' "that my actions will surely cause her. "After my death, I wish an autopsy performed on me to see if there's any mental disorder." We better go, father. We don't have too much time. [man on radio] 'The drama being played out here in Austin' 'is now over an hour old.' 'Since the sniping began, at about 11:45 this morning' 'some 42 people have been shot.' 'Thirteen are reported dead.' 'There are unconfirmed reports now' 'that the sniper has been identified.' 'There's also a rumor that several police officers' 'may already be on the top floor of the tower' 'trying to locate the sniper.' 'We will attempt to verify this information' 'with an in-person interview with Captain Fred Ambrose' 'at the emergency command post.' 'We will bring you all updated information' 'as soon as it happens.' 'Please stand by.' Tim, we got to these people out of here. They probably would be safer here. We can't get them out of the building as long as he's shooting anyway. Well, let's get them downstairs. At least out of the area. - Alright, let's do this. - Come on. Excuse me, sir, we're gonna have to move you and your family downstairs. - But my son, he's hurt. - Yes, sir, I see that. We'll get him to a hospital just as soon as we can. For the time being.. Foss, let's go. Give it to me! - Give it to me! - Let go, sir. - Let go. - Let me kill him! - Let go.. - He killed my family! - Let me kill him! - Alright, take it easy, sir. - Let me kill him. - Take it easy. - Let me kill him. - Hey, come on. [sobbing] Let me kill him. [gunfire] [Ambrose] 'Somebody, please move those people' 'out of the way.' [siren blaring] Uh, captain? - Don Wallace, KTNS. - Sorry. - No comment, Mr. Wallace. - Now, captain, please-- I said no comment, Mr. Wallace. Now, you'll get your story. You're just gonna have to wait till later. We've got wounded here. So, please clear out. Uh, captain, look, this city has been held in absolute terror for over an hour. 'Now, the people out there want to know' 'what's going on.' I'm not out here for a by-line no matter what you may think. But the people need to know. And somebody's got to tell them. [sighs] We, uh, have received word, that some of our officers uh, made it to the tower. At this moment, we are not in contact with those men. Beyond that, there's nothing I can say. We're doing everything we can. Captain, there have been reports that you have the identity of the sniper. Is that true? Uh, Mr. Wallace, uh, I can't answer any more questions. Uh, you're just gonna have to wait. Where are the others? Oh, they're still, uh, checking the offices, make sure there's nobody in there before we, uh, go on up. - Are you married? - Yeah. What's it look like down there? I don't know. Seemed awful quiet. I guess I've seen this tower every day that.. ...I've lived in this town. I...never thought about much though, you know. I remember, though, when I went into the service you know how fellas would talk about their hometown and this and that and.. Have I ever met-met anybody who'd ever been here? I'd always say them "Do you remember the tower.." [gunshots] What's taking them so long? Every time I'd ever think about home there would be this old tower just sticking up there as.. ...big as you please. I guess after today, it's going to be real famous. All of a sudden, any man from Austin, Texas is going to be a gun-crazed killer. You know what I mean. Let's get up those stairs. [clicking] [sighs] [sighs] [panting] Oh.. [breathing heavily] [whispering] Are we.. If we're going out there I think you ought to deputize me. You're not a cop? I work at the school here. Raise your right hand. Consider yourself deputized. I guess we better do this service-style, huh? Yeah. I'll go in. You cover. Maybe we better just both go on out there. What's your name? Allen Crum. Ramiro Martinez. I'll do it. It's my job. Out of all those fellas back there.. ...how did you end up here? How did you?
