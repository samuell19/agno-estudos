** Three days ago, at exactly 0600-- because that is really not the time, On February 5, Because that is really not the date, This freighter, which shall be nameless, sailed from a certain far-Eastern port. It's destination: the port of Los Angeles, Wilmington, California. This is fact. At exactly 15 minutes before, the freighter reaches a point inside the breakwater, for quarantine inspection. Directly in the path of the ship's course, a man is sighted, and rescued at sea... Step number one, in a daring scheme. This is Accomplice A. His story is simple-- A small fishing-boat sunk, no ship to shore equipment aboard to send out an SOS-- It could happen to anyone. A lucky thing, a freighter came along. The next step is also very simple. Routine. The health officer goes out to meet the ship. The anchor is dropped. Yellow flag goes up-- A warning to all other ships at sea that quarantine has been declared. This flag stays up until the vessel is cleared. Nobody leaves the ship, nobody comes aboard. Nobody, that is, except the health officer. This is Accomplice B. Accomplice B goes about examining the ship-- Inspecting the crew for any communicable diseases. When he, himself, feels suddenly ill. He manages to complete his inspection and clear the vessel. But now he begins feeling worse. The incident, actually, is not out of the ordinary. Nor even too surprising. Accomplice B is a known diabetic. He wears the special identification tag worn by all diabetics, in case they are ever found in shock. "I am a diabetic. "If found unconscious, Please give me sugar." Accomplice B assures the captain that he'll be all right, if he can just rest until the ship docks. The captain will send the launch back to port without him. ** Now, Accomplice B prepares himself. Checks the time. While Accomplice A clocks himself out for the next planned move. ** Accomplice A now puts the scheme into operation. He creates a diversion. Smoke. Fire aboard the ship. The fire-detector flashes to life. Shows where the smoke is coming from. An alarm is sent throughout the ship. The prearranged signal Accomplice B has been waiting for. He puts the second stage of the scheme into operation. No faking this time. He gives himself a shot, a deliberate overdose of insulin, which, in a very few moments now, will throw him into a severe state of induced insulin-shock. Yes, very real this time. ** And all the while, Accomplice A moves through the ship, making his way clear down into the hold, directly to the special cargo storage container. ** Accomplice A does his job well. Works back to the captain's cabin with his prize. And when B is carried off the ship, the prize will go with him. ** (siren blaring ) It is all beautifully planned. Timed right down to the last second. The ambulance reaches the dock. Accomplice C, the nurse, rushes aboard ship with the ambulance doctor. ** His diagnosis: Insulin-shock. You can't trick this. You can't fool a trained eye, a trained mind. The victim must be gotten to the hospital at once. Accomplice C knows exactly what to do. But exactly. ** (siren blaring) It's almost all too simple. Too easy. This little package, US Army medical supply, under US government bond, one quarter of a million dollars, of therapeutic value, on its way back into the United States. Passed on to Accomplice D, who gets the stuff to the boys on top, who cut it, push it, throw it on the open market. The sky's the limit. Ounces of big, white, fluffy happy clouds. Guaranteed delivered, for just a few 3-cent stamps. Safe and sound. After all, who doesn't trust the mail? I ran out of money. Had to play that last part myself. Not bad, Jordan. Only thing, you-you didn't serve popcorn. I like popcorn when I see a movie. (laughing) You change those two words around, Mr. Quantro, I'll keep you in popcorn for the rest of your life. You're a talented fella, Jordan-- Took courage to do what you did. Spend your last buck on a lot of make believe. Well, you don't get security without investment. So you hired yourself a boat, and a bunch of actors, and you made a picture. Anything went wrong, you could do it over again. But, how 'bout when it comes to the real thing? The right people, the real boat. A real heist. I've got my finger on the right people, Mr. Quantro. I've got the cargo storage plan of the real boat. And I know just where to put my hands on the real thing. Now, your only risk is putting up the money to buy those people. Mine is to make sure the real job comes off right the first time. If anything goes wrong, why... keep the film. You've got connections, you could sell it for a television series. (chuckling) (Harry) When? When, Jordan? When, what? Does the boat dock? Now, Mr. Quantro, next you'll be asking, "What's the name of the boat?" and "Who my people are?" "What hold the stuff's in?" Now, I tell you all that Mr. Quantro, why, you wouldn't need me, would ya? You know, you oughta add another word to that: Trust. Whaddaya say, Paula? It'll work, Harry. If Paula says it'll work, it'll work. (Paula) But, um-- But, what? Don't get touchy, Mr. Jordan. I like your whole idea. I think it's cute. It's adorable. I think Harry and his friends'll make a lot of money. I was only wondering-- Maybe it's just a woman's intuition... But, the nurse-- Who's she going to be? Oh, the nurse. Well, if I said it'd be just like having our own mother on the job, the nurse couldn't be any closer. My old lady me to the cops when I was a kid. It's like Harry just said, Mr. Jordan. I think he should protect his investment. What is it, Paula? Well, if I were that nurse, you'd be sure Mr. Jordan got that package to mail to you. Wouldn't you, Harry? Paula-- It's like she's got two heads on her shoulders. One of 'em for just thinking. Paula's the nurse, you got yourself a deal. There's only one thing I don't like about it. I didn't happen to think of it. (chuckling) Well, I'll buy the drinks, we'll discuss the details later. Mr. Jordan. I feel so lazy. Would you help me on with my shoes, please? ** (doorbell ringing) Welcome home. Oh, uh, sisters under the skin-- Paula, Jan. Jan, Paula. Ever been in California before? Nope. On a clear day you can take in the whole city. Oil wells, new convertibles, night clubs-- Even diamond bracelets in jewelry-store windows. I'm sure you'll enjoy every minute of it. So old-fashioned. Well-fed, little fellow. Just to keep the record straight, don't let that loose. You're supposed to be a nurse. This whole flat rents for 70 dollars a month. Your salary's supposed to be 100 dollars a week. I'll remember. (Jordan) It'll do. I have everything arranged. I'm on vacation. You're a friend. You're to take my place for a week. You show up tomorrow night, they'll be expecting you. Next, Eddie Mason. The intern that drives the ambulance. He's not in on this. Works the night shift and weekends to sweat out an extra buck. Now the emergency call will come through to the docks the morning the freighter pulls in. Just as simple as that. Your credentials. A first aid book. Oh, I'll get by. There isn't any part of the anatomy I don't know. Even with my eyes closed. I, uh, think I can brief her on the rest. (door closing) She the one that's close to you as your own, uh... mother? Ah, let's not be psychological, Paula. That's what you told Harry. Pretend you're my mother. Now who's getting psychological, Jordan? Let's put it this way-- Let's not be greedy. Let's you and me just try to concentrate on Harry's investment. For the time being. Is that all I'm allowed to concentrate on? What's the matter, Jordan? Don't you like my other head? I like mine. I don't wanna die thinkin' of Harry having it stuffed, hanging over the mantle of his fireplace. Harry's a pig, and you know it. You saw how fast he let me go when he thought he wasn't going to get all that was coming to him. When you thought. So sue me. ** You'd better see a doctor, Jordan, you've got a low blood count. You're wrong, Paula. I've got no blood. Now get this through your head. Both of 'em. I didn't ask for you. I inherited you. And my only vision of you nights, when I crawl into bed, is you handing over that package. Next you'll be wanting a loyalty oath. Not me. Harry. You better put your shoes on. ** (train engine chugging) (distant train whistle) (distant train whistle) (car door closing) (car engine starting) (man screaming) (siren blaring) Relax, you'll get used to it. They get outta the way. (tires squealing) (siren blaring) Well, sometimes. (siren blaring) How come something like you picked something like this for a career? Drive, Hippocrates. You've been askin' me about me since I came on the job. Next thing I know, you'll be askin' me up to your place to see your etchings. Of an operation. My place? (chuckling) If I had a room for an etching, I would invite you up. (siren blaring) (crowd chattering) Better come over here, first. The mother and father, they're over there. Both dead. The poor kid. The poor, little kid. Nothin' we can do here. Gimme a hand with him. Cover him up. Come here. (crowd chattering) (ambulance doors closing) All right, folks, let's all go home now. (siren blaring) ** (tapping) ** (crying) ** Hey, we'll have none a that. He's dead... He hadn't even started to live. He's dead. That's right, he is dead. Nothin' you or I could do about it, either. Five minutes from now, or five seconds, we're liable to get another call. This time to pick up somebody else who will live. Only he may be so mangled up for life that he should be dead. And you'll ask yourself, "Where's the justice?" Please, Eddie, do you have to talk like that now? Don't let life or death rub off on you, if this is what you wanna do. You should know that. But he was only a child. A baby. Sure, he was just a baby, but... They're no favorites. (crying) Hey-hey, what are you? A nurse, or a woman? Both. Because I wear a starched uniform, does that make me any less a woman? I'll get you some hot coffee. ** There's your Aladdin's lamp, Herbie. Go on, open it. Feel it. Rub your hands over it. There's a genie inside. Can put you on any ship you want. Sail you all over the seven seas, take you anyplace you wanna go. You can start livin', Herbie. You can be free. Sure. You can have anything you want. Anything money can buy. I guess I had you figured wrong. (pounding glass) Did I say "No?" Don't be a genie-giver, my friend. Hey, Chiquita! Bring me and my genie-friend another drink. Now take it easy, Herbie. You'll be having to take another shot of insulin as a chaser in a minute. Aren't you the lucky one? And isn't it ironical, that I grow up to be a health officer? Hm? Me-- Poor, sick, diabetic Herbert Fay? The "sick as a dog" Herbert. A health officer. And aren't you the lucky one? The day I collapse and go into shock, and the call goes just to the right emergency hospital. Now who figures he's got himself just the right thing at the right time? What's your message, Herbie? Everybody's got different tastes. Some like 'em thin, some like 'em fat. Now you take this little genie here. I think he's too thin. (laughing) I like nice fat genies! Sure. I'll see that he puts on more weight. That's kind and generous, my friend. How 'bout that drink? Sure, sure. You and I are staying close together, little genie. From now on, no more dreams. No more dreams to keep you awake, feeling drained, empty, alone. From now on, you're gonna change all that. Aren't ya, little genie? (chuckling) (foghorn blowing) (punching and groaning) (Stanley) Who are you? You pull me outta bed, and bring me down here, and start beating me up? (punching) Ah! (punching) Ah! (groaning) (punching) Ooh! Ah! (punching) All right, butcher boy-- you made up your mind yet? (Stanley) You're crazy! I don't know how ya are, but you're crazy! I don't know who you are, but I sure found out. Takes a lot of convincing! (punching) Change your mind, butcher boy! Or you're gonna scorch. You're gonna scorch to a crisp. (panting) I won't do it. I won't do it. I won't-- (punching) (woman on tape) She had a crush on him. My sister gave him all her love. He took it. (Stanley) Helen-- Helen's sister! You got a good memory, butcher boy. And Helen's sister, she's very cooperative. She hates ya. (woman on tape) And then he turned around and he killed that love. With his own two hands, he destroyed it. And left her dead inside. Like a tree with roots, ripped and torn. He told her surgery was the only way. Now she's dead. (punching) Don't go yet, butcher boy-- I want ya to hear all of it. (groaning) (woman on tape) The police know how it happened. The autopsy proved that. She made her mistake, and she paid for it. But he's still walkin' around free somewhere-- Yeah, you're gonna pay, too, butcher boy. The way you killed her. Your kinda surgery, that's the dirtiest kinda murder. No, please! I've been eatin' myself alive ever since. I've paid! I paid. (woman on tape) I looked everywhere, from one end to the other. There was no trace-- (Stanley) I'll-I'll make it up! (punching and groaning) (woman on tape) I'll give anything to see him suffer. (banging) I got another tape just like that, butcher boy. Same voice, same words, same sister. Now just remember everything I told ya. Where to be, when to be there. Butcher boy. All right. I'll do it. I'll do it. (crying) I'll do it. (crying) (crying) ** Daddy. I've been all over town, I've been tryin' to find you all night! I need help. Please, Daddy, I need help. I'm in trouble. So? I need help. I'm not your mother. Daddy, please, I'm in terrible shape. I've got to have help. You just come off the farm. What kind of cure they give you there? It was all right. I kicked it. Something happened, something-- Something personal. Don't ever do that. ** I'm sick. You're a sick risk. Keep their eyes on guys like you. They got their bloodhounds roamin' around, ready to give out one loud bark, the minute they smell you goin' back on the stuff. That makes me hot. Then I got to dig in the sewers, and stay there 'till things cool. That won't happen. You can trust me. "That won't happen. "You can trust me." Please, Daddy. I got to have some-- Shut up. I want to enjoy this. ** Bail me out. Cost you to get sick once. To get well, twice as much. All right. You got it with you? Yes. Put it in the napkin. ** (fingers snapping) Coffee. ** Take two packets of sugar. It'll steady your nerves. ** (applause) ** (phone ringing) Herbert Fay. Uh-huh. Uh, no, no, it's, uh, it's the Kobayash, out of Yokohama. Berth 24. I'm just going there now to clear from quarantine. That's quite all right-- No trouble at all. (distant foghorn) (distant foghorn) ** Mr. Fay, you all right? Who? What'd you say? You don't look so good, Mr. Fay. You sure you're not sick? This analysis I just ran showed a big change. Is that, uh, good or bad? Good. Your blood-sugar levels shot way up. I want you off all insulin for a week. See what happens. You what? Just cut out taking your insulin shots, Mr. Fay. But-- But what, Mr. Fay? I-I-I don't understand. What happens if-if I do take a shot? Well, as I said, if your condition keeps improving, as indicated, insulin could throw you in shock again. There's one danger. The strain could produce a heart attack. But, you don't have those worries now. You're one of the lucky ones. Yeah. I'm one of the lucky ones. (doorbell) Just a minute! (doorbell) (chuckling) Wow, you are stuck up. Well, help. Careful now, a girl can split her clavicle trying to squeeze herself into anything this way. Don't get personal. I'm just being clinical. Thanks. Anytime. Anytime, what? Anytime you feel like splitting your clavicle again, it'd be a pleasure to help. Come on, let's eat. Oh, Eddie, you shouldn't have spent all that money. Oh, don't worry. I'll collect your share. I'm proud but I'm practical. Plates, please. Ham sandwiches, mmm. They're beginning to give me a neurosis. And what's wrong with ham sandwiches? For the poor people. So pretend the caraway seeds are caviar. (chuckling) Your champagne, Ms. Nightengale. God bless. Mmm, delicious. From contended cows, since 1926. One of the best years, of course. Oh, definitely. Now, some people prefer skim instead of homogenized. And then there's people who like pure pasteurized. Now, personally, I get my kicks from straight alcohol, with just a dash of peach flavoring. Oh, you fool. Paula? Do you think I can make it? You'll make it, Eddie. You'll make it good. I know you will. Sometimes I wonder. When everything inside me starts flippin'. Big responsibility, watching over other peoples' lives. Maybe I'm just trying to talk myself out of it now, I don't know. If I starve enough, maybe I'll change my mind. I don't wanna settle for being one of the charmed boys, on the better side of town, running a prescription palace. No, there's a big shortage of these in the world, and I wanna use 'em. They're all I know how to think with. Good, strong hands, Eddie. Don't ever be afraid to use them. You know, I got so wrapped up, I forgot to tell you the good news. They're gonna let me assist at surgery at the clinic tomorrow. Oh, that's wonderful! This big worried speech I just made, I guess maybe I'm a little scared. Oh, Eddie. ** Hey, you know somethin'? Your friend, Jan? Her letting you fill in for her while she's gone, is the best vacation she ever had. (doorbell) I hope I'm not breaking anything up. I was just getting ready for work, if it isn't important. I'm just passing by. I'll wait for ya, downstairs. I'll be right down, Eddie. Cozy twosome. Hey, that Eddie, nice lookin' boy. What are you doing, playing watch-dog for Harry? Oh, don't go on the defensive, Paula. Harry's my angel, but your private life is your own. It's the day after tomorrow. Saturday-Saturday morning, at 10:00. At 10:00 the boat's due to dock. That emergency call will come through in plenty of time. Now, After that, after it's all over, before you go East... Then, I'd like to congratulate you. Sorry about the other night, Stanley. Pushing you around like that. Sometimes we all have to do things we don't like to do. I know. No hard feelings? No. Good, I'll make it up to you, like I promised. After it's all over. Sure. Got everything fixed in your mind? About tomorrow? Got the boat layout clear? The cargo storage plan? I burned it. Like ya said. Well, that's it then, Stanley. You, uh, unlock that stuff, get it where it's supposed to go, just like unlocking a prison door for yourself. Walk out a free man. Helen's sister's voice-- it's all yours. And you, I never saw you before in my life. Don't lose that key, Stanley. Hold it tight. Now, if I'd been you, standing there looking at me... I don't know if I'd a jumped or pushed. (distant fog horn) ** (knocking) A Mr. Natas of Western Pharmaceutical, is here to see you. Who? Mr. Natas. Oh, yes, have him come in. You can come in now, Mr. Natas. (distant foghorn) Mr. Fay. I, uh, thought I'd come by, and... wish ya luck. You're a very lucky fella, Herbie. Say what you have to say, then get out. Now, Herbie, is that the way to talk? You know, ever since I first saw you I've been feeding your genie. Fattening him up. I'd say by tomorrow night, when he comes to sea, he should be just about your size. A nice, fat little genie. You finished? Relax, Herbie. You look a little pale. Now get to bed early tonight. I want you to be fresh, full of vitality tomorrow, so you can do a good job. I'm counting on it. Oh, I, uh... I almost forgot. It's for you. Compliments of Western Pharmaceutical. (distant foghorn) (door closing) (glass breaking) ** Eddie, about the other night. The man who was here-- I don't wanna know about him. I've got to tell you-- I don't wanna hear. But it's not what you think. Look, Paula, we're not kids anymore-- I don't care-- I love you. I've got to tell you. Maybe at first, when he first walked in, I was a little hurt. Eddie, listen to me. No, I won't listen. What you did yesterday, the day before that, it doesn't matter. To-tomorrow's what I'm interested in. You, and me, and tomorrow. About tomorrow, Eddie, I got to tell you. Don't tell me, I'll tell you. Tell me what, Eddie? That I love you. I love you, too, Eddie. ** Oh, Eddie. Just call me plain, crazy, old fashioned. But I want things to be good with us, Paula. Good the right way. If you don't mind ham on rye for a couple of centuries, I wanna marry you. No, don't say anything now. I want you to be sure, awfully sure. 'Cause for a long time things won't come easy. I don't want you ever to be sorry. Good-night. ** (crying) ** (doorbell) Eddie! Eddie? No. It isn't Eddie. Where you going? I wanted to pack now. To be ready to get out, after tomorrow. Can't wait to hurry back to Harry, huh? Loyalty. (slapping) Oh! That's what I like, loyalty. Smart, loyal Paula. (slapping) Got her heart and soul wrapped up in only one thing: Harry! And Harry's investment. Doing everything she can to protect Harry's investment. Ain't that right, Paula? Sure, sure that's right-- you even said so yourself, remember? "If I was that nurse, "you'd be sure Mr. Jordan "got that package "to mail to you, "wouldn't ya, Harry?" (slapping) (whimpering) You know what I think? I'll tell ya what I think. I think ya took your shoes off. Only this time you thought you could step out of 'em and run. No, Jordan, Eddie doesn't know anything-- not about you, me, tomorrow, anything! Eddie, huh? Yeah, it had to be Eddie. I thought I saw him in your eyes the other night, when I looked at ya, but I couldn't be sure. Came by tonight to set things straight for tomorrow, and I saw his car outside and I waited. Yeah. I see him now. Just by lookin' at ya. All right, I was packing to leave-- Now, alone. Eddie asked me to marry him. Congratulations. Not the kind I planned to give you. (slapping) I'll do 'till something better comes along. You don't believe anything honest could hit people, do you? You couldn't understand why I had to leave Eddie, why I couldn't marry him. I'll tell you what I understand. I understand the weeks, months, waiting for tomorrow to come. Plans I made. The sweating-- yeah, even the prayers I prayed that nothing would go wrong. And I'll tell ya something else. I begged, borrowed, and grabbed every penny I could get my hands on to promote your Harry. I killed a man after he gave me what I wanted. I blackmailed another man to let him save his own life. I used another man's life to let him live his life. I even loved a woman. I did all that just for tomorrow! Well, have your tomorrow, Jordan. But let me out. Let me get out, get away from here. Yeah, wouldn't that be smart? I love Eddie. I love him enough to get out of his life, just stay out! And I believe ya. But what about tomorrow? Suppose you wake up with a conscience? (panting) No. No, Jordan, no one will ever know. I won't tell anyone. I won't tell, I won't tell, I won't tell-- (gasping) (crying) That's right, Paula. You won't tell anyone. (gasping) (telephone ringing) (telephone ringing) (telephone ringing) (telephone ringing) So forgive my elegy. People with a conscience. (telephone ringing) (telephone ringing) ** (Jan) You said you were gonna call last night. (exhaling) Or, maybe you've been too busy? I want you to go to the hospital tomorrow morning, in her place. Mason asks any questions, you don't know anything. Why mustn't I know anything? She called ya, said she couldn't make it. But that doesn't tell me where you've been, or why you haven't seen me. Look, I'll be down at the docks myself. Make sure you get that stuff to me before you take off in the ambulance with Fay. Take it from him while on board ship. Go to the cabin. Is she tired, darling? Doesn't like to get up so early in the morning? Or maybe she's just gone to bed. You got a suspicious nature. That's right, I have. And suddenly your whistle is off-key. I don't think so. See how this sounds. Oh, darling, darling. I've missed you so. ** She didn't say anything at all to you? Nothing. And you were with her last night? Yeah. I still don't get it. What she tell ya? She called, said she wouldn't be on the job today, tomorrow, farewell, period. Just like that? Just like that. She didn't say why, where she'd be, or where she was going? She didn't say. I tried to phone her last night, after I left, and didn't get any answer. I tried a few minutes later, still no answer. What time was that? About two 2:30 this morning. ** (boat motor humming) (splashing) This fella we picked up, before you boarded, seemed to be suffering from severe exposure. Mind having a look at him? Ah, yes, I'll check before I leave. Well, you better pour this in to ya. You'll shiver your insides loose. I'm getting so cold. I need something. Now drink your tea, it'll make ya feel better. Please. You've-you've gotta help me. I need something. Yeah, sure, sure, son. Sure you won't have a drink? I seen 'em board some beautiful stuff, just before we cleared the last port. No thanks, next time. Now, uh, what about this man you wanted me to see? What's a matter? Don't know. I feel funny. Anything I can do? Must be one of my spells. It'll pass. If I can just lay down for awhile. Well, stay aboard 'till we dock. I'll send the tender back. Thanks. Now, if you'll help me off my coat. Yeah. Mr. Fay, you can just use my bunk. Thank you. ** Now, here. Here, take a sip of this. ** The man we picked up on the raft-- He's violent, he's headed for the hold. (alarm sounding) ** (alarm sounding) ** (crying) (key clattering on floor) ** (indistinct chatter) I need-I need help. (pounding) Daddy, please, I need help. Daddy! Daddy, let me in! Daddy, please, I'm sick. Give-- just give me something. Something, Daddy! I need help! Daddy! (crying) Daddy, ple-- No! Let me-- Daddy! Daddy, help me! Daddy, please! No, no, no, Daddy! I'm sick, I'm sick! ** (siren blaring) (siren blaring) (distant siren) Take your pick, doc-- a dead one, or a raving one. (siren blaring) You Eddie Mason? Yeah. Just came over cable for ya. What goes on, whaddaya want with me? Relax, Miss, where's Jordan? Jordan? Hello? Is this 408? (woman on phone) Yes. I'm Eddie Mason, I got a message to call. (woman on phone) Just a minute, please. Hello? (Eddie) Paula? Eddie. Eddie, darling, are you all right? Well, sure I'm all right. What about you? Oh, Eddie, I love you so much. I love you, too. I'm comin' over, right now. Bye, baby. Oh, I love ya. Well, let's go then. The other girl gave us the whole bit. We'll find him. The "other girl?" Yes, the other girl. Jordan! Jordan! Catch him! Jordan! Jordan! Jordan! Stop! ** (engines starting) ** (sirens blaring) ** (train rumbling) ** (sirens blaring) (metal crashing) (metal clanging) (metal crashing) **
