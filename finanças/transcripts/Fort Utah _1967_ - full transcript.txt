[horse blusters] [horse blusters] [blustering] [shouts] [groans] If I'd gotten here a minute sooner, I could have picked him off that rock before he jumped ya. He wanted your horse. His horse is dead, back over yonder where the buzzards are. If you weren't such an ornery-looking cuss, I'd swear you were Ben Coots. I ain't any more ornery than I used to be. I ain't seen hide nor hair of you since... since that day in Tucson. Yeah, that was the day I signed on as an Indian agent. About... About three years ago. You know, I've been trailing you for miles, trying to figure out who you was. Who'd you think I was? Wasn't sure. But right now I don't trust nobody out in this territory. Something gone wrong? Worse than that. The Indians I've been wet-nursing, they jumped the reservation. And right now they're terrorizing everybody and anything in this territory. What triggered 'em? Damn if I know. I was making my yearly trip to the Indians Affair Office in Denver. On my way back here, I got word that all hell had broken loose. I sure didn't know there were any hostiles around here. And my job is to round 'em up and bring 'em back to the government feeding grounds. Single-handed, I suppose. If I can get any help from the army... If not, single-handed. That's gonna be kind of impossible. What probably will happen is my head's gonna wind up on an Indian lodgepole with a bunch of naked savages dancing, whooping and hollering all around me. Then you'd better quit now while your head is still where it is. [chuckles] Being an Indian agent is about the only thing I'm fit for these days. So I reckon I'll hang around, lodgepole and all. Only game in town, huh? Something like that. Stacked odds too. He was probably from a scouting party. But you can bet the rest of your whiskey there are more of 'em around here somewhere, snooping about. I thought this was gonna be a nice, peaceful trip. Well, if you're lucky enough to hang onto your scarf for a few more days, it might be. A trip? Where? Placed called "anywhere I light." You ever been there? Come on, Horn. Things can't be as bad as all that. That's what I keep telling myself. [blustering] You know, I'm out here looking for a wild hyena by the name of Dajin. And them Indians ain't gonna start behaving until I get him. That who you thought I was when you were following me? Dajin? The only trouble is, I don't know what he is, who he is and where he is. Not only that, I don't even know what the devil he looks like. You know, the way I figure it, there's only one outside chance. Yeah? What's that? Well, if them Indians are willing to settle for his scalp, I figure the rest of us can live to a ripe old age. The only trouble is till, when and if they get Dajin, they'll massacre every white man in sight. Right now they're seeing us. That's the rest of the scouting party I was telling you about. [gunshots continue] [screams] [shouting] Ain't never gonna get 'em back to the reservation this way. You can get 'em back feetfirst, if you want 'em that way. Feetfirst don't count. Maybe both our heads will end up on those lodgepoles. Maybe so. [gunshots] [screaming] Ow! Why is it every time I get nicked, it's always in the same place? Let's do it your way. Feetfirst. [whooping] Looks like those lodgepoles will have to wait. I wouldn't count on it if I was you. There's a lot more of 'em around. All over. Next time there won't be so few of 'em. [whinnies] Looks like I'm not the only one around here who didn't know about the Indians being on a rampage. Just look at 'em. Dumb and innocent, like they was riding into a picnic ground. What about the army in this area? They should know about the Indians. Seems like somebody should have told 'em them Indians jumped the reservation. Fort Utah around here somewhere? Oh, couple hours ride over yonder a ways. Well, why didn't they send some soldiers over here to protect those people? The army's always posted when a wagon train's coming through. Appears there's been some kind of a slipup. It appears there might be some kind of a massacre. I'll ride over to the fort. I was heading that way anyhow. Tell 'em to get some soldiers over here to protect these people. You better tell that wagon master to pull up that outfit, hold fast and wait for the soldiers. Or for the Indians. Infernal wagon master. Keeps us going from daylight to dark. [whinnies] Whoa! Whoa. [man] Whoa! I'm looking for the wagon master. You're looking at the wagon master. You better stop your wagons. There's trouble up ahead. Well, there's trouble behind too. Wagon trouble all the way. Lost enough time on this trip already. You may lose a lot more. Well, I figure we roll the wagons for about two hours more before dark. Most wagon trains have a scout to tell 'em when there's Indians around. The scout we had disappeared two days ago. Indians? Hostile. The whole area is full of 'em. We ain't never made camp this early before. Ha! [men] Hey! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! I guess that's what happened to Hogan, our scout. I'd been chewing him out pretty regular, and when he didn't come back, I thought he just took off or lit out somewhere. But if what you say is true, Indians could have got him. Friend of mine is riding into Fort Utah. He'll get some soldiers back here. I sure hope we don't need 'em. Should be here sometime tonight. I don't want them to know about the Indians or the soldiers getting here. They'll see 'em when they get here. You ask me, your people should be told what's going on. - I'm not asking you. - They have a right. A right to what? To be scared to death? Women, children, greenhorn tenderfoots. Ain't nothing they can do about it anyhow, except pray. Mister, did you ever lose a wagon train in the past? You're pretty savvy, mister. What's your name? Tom Horn. I heard of you. I'm Eli Jonas. Did lose a wagon train once. Some of them know about it. They're skittish. You tell 'em about the Indians, they'll panic. Look, you don't want to tell your people what's going on, all right, that's your business. But someone's gonna have to keep a lookout. You and me, Mr. Horn. We'll sit up the whole long night and keep watch. The Indians probably know you're in this territory. Best thing for you to do would be to pretend you don't know about them. Light your fires, have your usual evening. ** [ Harmonica ] Anyone on watch? Yeah, regular man on routine watch. He should be coming down directly. We'll take over then, huh? Yeah. They enjoy themselves this way practically every night. Except it's a little different tonight. That's because they don't know they're in hostile territory. I don't suppose anyone knows what tomorrow will bring. Well, those Indians show up, they're in for a surprise. So are these people. I brought a load of repeating rifles along on this trip. Now the Indians don't expect that kind of opposition. There's always a chance they'll get a bellyful and turn tail. There's also a chance they won't. Those soldiers show up that you've been talking about, I'll sure worry a lot less about it. ** [ Continues ] [ Man ] Very good. Hey, Sam. Do your imitation of the wagon master telling Hogan off. Oh. [chuckles] Look here, Hogan, you miserable, flea-bitten, sad, sorry excuse for a man. [laughing] No wonder Hogan never came back. A wagon train scout you ain't. Blamed if I ain't stuck with you, like these nice people are stuck with you. I ought to break Sam Tyler's jaw. Well, you sound just like he's making you out to be. [Sam] And another thing, Hogan. When you report back, I want to know about every tree, shrub, hill, dale, rock and rattlesnake along the way. You understand, Hogan? [laughter] Oh, come on now. Don't be bashful. Ladies and gentlemen, we're in for a big treat. No, no. Please. Miss Linda Lee has consented to sing us an air from La Boheeme. There must be some mistake. I didn't say... No, no. No, no. Thank you, but I won't be able to sing tonight. You see, my voice is very... Greer's been bullying her ever since she joined the train. Miss Linda Lee, huh? Mm-hmm. Yeah, she's traveling with an elderly couple named Potts. Greer's got a wife, but he hasn't given Miss Lee a moment's peace. Well, little lady... Come on, Miss Lee. Lift your pretty little head and sing for us. You see? He suspects she can't sing at all. Now he's got the others ragging her. Well, then stop it. Oh, she could stop it soon enough, all by herself if she wanted to. Just prove she can sing. You want it stopped, you do it. [Greer] Well, now, you want to hear her sing, don't ya? She's one of those big opera singers. She keeps promising... [applause] [man] Hey, what's the idea? What do you think you're doing, mister? I'll walk you to your wagon, ma'am. Who says you will? I don't even know who you are. [Jonas] Greer. I don't think you want to find out. Well, who is he? I never saw him before. I saw him. He just rode up and latched on to the wagon train here [Jonas] He'll be gone tomorrow. For me, that's not soon enough. Come on. Don't waste any time on him. Come on. Stop. If you ain't gone by morning, mister, we'll settle this. Almost makes it worth waiting for. [crowd murmuring] Oh. Oh, I was waiting to... Well, I wanted to thank you for... Well, go ahead. [chuckles] Well, you see, they don't understand about operatic singing. Almost nobody does. How the raw night air can be very harmful on one's throat and... Oh, that concertina, I mean, to try to accompany a soprano... That's what I am, a lyric soprano. With that jarring, discordant notes of a squeeze box type instrument, it's ridiculous. It's impossible. That was a pretty long thank-you, ma'am. You haven't listened to a word I've said. I was listening. [sighs] You don't believe me either. You're like all the rest. Except I'm not asking you to sing. Who are you? I'm not so sure myself anymore. You must have a name. Yeah, sure. Name's Tom Horn. Are you joining us on this trip? No, I'm going in the opposite direction. Any place in particular? No. No place in particular. I see. Well, where did you come from? Same place, more or less. [chuckles] Traveling from nowhere into somewhere. Isn't that always the hope? [chuckles] You might say that's where I'm from. Nowhere. Only my nowhere has a name. St. Louis. And you're going to a somewhere that has a name. Yes. San Francisco. I have a singing engagement there. Well, I guess I never did get around to simply saying thank you. For the song you didn't have to sing? Yes. Well, good-bye, Mr. Horn. I suppose if you're going on your way soon, I won't be seeing you again. No, I expect not. [footsteps approaching] If we're gonna stand watch, we better head for some high ground. I'll settle for that hill over there. Well, that leaves me that bluff straight across from it. [whinnies] [whinnies] Horn. - I didn't see no sign of no Indians. - Good. And I ain't seen any sign of that friend of yours with soldiers. - They'll be here. - You said he'd be here last night. That's right. I did. If the Indians didn't get him. Took your word about everything. Could be you're setting us up for a band of cutthroat robbers. And I could be saving my skin by getting out of here. Well, Horn, I can't wait any longer. If this is hostile country, I've gotta get that wagon train out of here. Then head it toward Fort Utah. It's the only protection within a hundred miles of here. -I'm going straight up that trail. -And maybe right into an ambush. We roll those wagons fast enough, we'll get out of this prairie. If you don't, those people will be buried on it. You ain't telling me how to run my wagon train. You owe them a choice of going to the fort or risking their lives. Like I said last night, I'm not telling them nothing about no Indians. - Then I will. - No, you won't. Not you or anyone else. Who do you think you are to decide whether people should live or die? Why won't you listen to reason? No Johnny-come-lately is gonna tell me my business. Those people don't have to know nothing I see fit to keep from 'em. Well, I think they do. [horse whinnies] [groans] [whinnies] [whinnies] [coughs] Those people are my responsibility, no matter what you say, and I do what I think is right for 'em. Get... [grunts] Ain't no use we talk about Indians. Not until I am positive there's gonna be trouble. I know from experience I'm right. And if I have to kill you to make you understand, then I'll kill you. There's one thing you better never have to learn from experience. Don't hold a gun on me. You're so all-fired worked up, why don't you go to the fort and get the soldiers. It's for sure somebody has to. In the meantime, we'll get out of here and go just as far away from this place as we can. I hope for the sake of the people that are with you that it's a long way. [whinnies] [blusters] [whinnies] [blusters] [whinnies] [Tom] Sergeant of the guard! Anyone around? [wood creaks] [creaks] - Where'd he come from? - I don't know. Come on, laddie boy. Come on. It's time to wake up. I guess this time I've been following you, huh? I reckon you figured the Indians got me, huh? Stockade? Yeah. Fort Utah. Who did get us? I don't know. It was dark when I got here. I couldn't see 'em, but whew! I sure could smell 'em. I saw three of 'em, but I wasn't noticing the smell. [chuckles] You're just lucky. You must have been downwind. From the looks of what a couple were wearing, I'd say army deserters. You know, it sure beats me where the army's gone to. Moved out. Yeah, permanent like. Left the fort deserted, and those three pack rats moved in. I just can't figure why the likes of them would want to hole up in this empty fort. Yeah. And why they'd be careful just to bust our skulls, not kill us. It's gotta be that they're waiting on word from somebody before they do us in. Maybe they won't kill us then until he gets back. There's gotta be a way out of here. I just ain't been able to figure it out yet. Those people in the wagon train... Indians show up, there won't be any way out for them either. There's one thing for damn sure. They're not gonna get any help from this empty fort. I ran into a troop of cavalry riding out here from the East. I talked to the officer in charge. Told him where the wagon train might be. Before I rode out, he promised me that he'd ride herd on 'em. Good. Good. Then at least they'll get some help. Yep. [sighs] Maybe I should have taken the wagon train to the fort after all. Well, you can still change your mind, but like Mr. Stokes said, for your own safety, we better escort you as far as Narrow Ridge. I reckon you're right. I'm beholden to Stokes for sending you boys to join us. Lieutenant, we're in for it. I'll get the men and ride ahead, try to draw 'em off. No, you stay with us. I got me some rifles to issue. Whoa. Eli Jonas has sure been acting mighty skittish since those soldiers got here a while ago. Sure like to know what that old buzzard's got on his mind. I'll deploy the men. [whistles] Hyah! He must have seen something. Jonas. Hey, Jonas! Form a circle. Then I want you back at the last wagon, pronto. Hey! Get out of here! Hyah! Looks like the Indians are coming. [Linda] Oh, no. What are we going to do? We're probably gonna have to fight for our life. Mr. Jonas. Mr. Jonas, sir. Ain't there a chance we can make a run for it? Get the rest of the men over here. Yes, sir. Rafe! Give me a hand with these rifles. Whoa. Hyah! Hyah! [whooping] [whooping] Don't you worry. We'll be all right. Here. Repeating rifle. You knew there was Indians out there. - These will hold 'em at bay. - You should have told us. Get back to your wagon! [shouting] [whooping] [gunshots] [whooping] [whooping] [whooping] [gunshot] [whooping] [screams] [screaming] Tom! Tom! [whooping] Not even time to bury our dead. Miracle any of us got out. We're on our way to the fort. There are soldiers there. We'll be safe. Hyah. It's giving a little. Yeah, looks like the termites might have chewed it loose, huh? Wish they'd been hungrier. You know, this is the first time I ever bust out anywhere since I was a kid locked in the outhouse. [laughs] Give me a boost, will ya? Okay. What do you think you're shooting at? They got out, ran in there. Stay out here in case they try to come out one of the windows or the door down there. You tried to kill 'em. What was I supposed to do, invite them in for tea? Dajin said anybody came here, you're supposed to try to hold 'em alive for him. Dajin. That's the hyena I've been looking for. Now he's looking for you. I'm gonna tell you one thing. Dajin ain't gonna like it. He ain't gonna like it for sure one bit. Go on. [grunts] [groans] [grunts] They got to Sarge. I'm going after Dajin. Dajin told us to stay here. [creaking] [creaking] [clicking] [glass shatters] Winged him. [gunshots] Gone for his friend Dajin. And you can bet when Dajin comes back he'll have more friends with him. The way I count there's still one here. That's one too many. [footsteps receding] Keep me covered. [gunshots] [groans] [groans] [body thuds on ground] Thanks. Now let's get out of here. We got to bury the stink. Him and the one back over there. The time we're finished their friends will be back and bury us. Hold on. We ain't checked this whole place out yet. Do you expect to find something? You forget I'm a government agent. I have to fill out more reports than I got hair on my face. Inventory of an empty fort, huh? You also forget that I'm supposed to take Dajin alive, not hide from him. You want to go, go ahead. All right, let's bury the stink. The sun's about down. We better light a couple of lamps before that wild hyena and his crew get back. They see the place dark, they'll know for sure it's a trap. [crickets chirping] Sure is a lot of dried up blood in there. Like they took indoor target practice. Them soldiers didn't suddenly up and leave this fort. Looks more like they died in it. Yeah. Some of them right there in the CO's office. Mutiny maybe. There wasn't supposed to be more than 20 or 30 men in there at the best. Dajin and some of his men took care of them. In the middle of the night. They couldn't have stormed the fort, so he must have been one of the soldiers stationed here. If he wasn't, ain't likely the others would have followed them. They probably dug a trench somewhere and dumped the bodies in one of top of the other. I can understand why the government would want Dajin, but why do the Indians want him? I reckon we'll find out soon enough. [wagon approaching] Dajin. It sounds like a wagon. He could have a wagon. How many men has he got? It's the people from the wagon train! Come on, get that gate open! [creaking] [creaking] This is all that's left of us and the wagons. Did manage to salvage a few rifles though. What happened to the troop of cavalry I sent over? [Greer] Wiped out to a man. A massacre. - Where are the soldiers? - There ain't none. The fort's deserted. You lied to me when you said there were soldiers here. He didn't lie. We thought there was. We figure they were bushwhacked. No whole bunch of soldiers gets themselves bushwhacked. Why, some of them poor devils got their throats cut while they was sleeping. I've been blaming myself for not taking your advice in the first place. Now, as it turns out, there ain't no protection here either. Even if he doesn't, I feel safer being here inside this fort. - Hello, again. - Hi. Glad you're all right. The man from nowhere. - Oh, he ain't from nowheres, ma'am. - Oh? - He's been a lot of places and done a lot of things. - All right, Ben. All right. Maybe you people coming out here from the East haven't heard about Tom Horn. But he's known well out here in the West. Leastwise for his gun. So you're a gunfighter. According to my friend Ben Stokes. That's what you're running from, your reputation. The fear people have when they see you. Fear makes a pretty dreary world. And lonely, I suspect. Yeah. That's the worst of it. So, you want to go someplace where nobody knows you and, uh, start again, huh? Well, people have been known to do that. Yes, I'm sure they have, and I think people deserve to be able to... Each of you ladies will have a room in the officer's quarters. You men will have to shift for yourselves. Well, good night. You know, you were right about what people deserve to be able to do. I'm so glad you think so. Good night. It wasn't your fault. Go on and tell me. It's one of the hazards of running a wagon train. You already know that. I can still see their faces, hear their screams. And where do I bring the few that are still left alive for protection? A haunted army fort. It's haunted all right, by the ghosts of murdered soldiers. [metal clanking] I once heard there was a cache of gold stored here at this fort. Your hearing was right. It was a million dollars in bullion. - That's what Dajin was after. - Who's Dajin? Him and them that was in on the massacre. They're still living here. They're not here right now, but we can expect them back, that's for sure. That gold was shipped out of the fort months ago, secretly, so word wouldn't leak out in advance and nobody would hijack it. So secret even Dajin didn't know it was gone. Yeah, he found out his bloody massacre was for nothing. So now they're out roaming the countryside trying to round up some food, clothes, money, maybe even women. Well, that means they'll fight us when they get back. If they can, kill us. You can count on it. If one of us got word out about the mutiny, the whole United States Cavalry would be out hunting them. That's why he left a couple of men here. In case a stranger showed up. Well, get the word out. There isn't a telegraph station within a hundred miles of here. Dajin and his men would be back and wipe us out before one of us could get to a telegraph. So what you're saying is we're trapped. I take those people out, we face Indian tomahawks. We stay here, it's those cutthroat deserters. - How many are there? - We don't know. Leastways, we got some protection inside the fort. I'm going up in the sentry box and keep watch. You two better get a good night's sleep. You're gonna need it. He's sure looking forward to meetin' up with Dajin. And we're the bait. - [Linda] Get out. - [Greer] You be quiet. [door closes] [Linda] Don't you come near me. That Indian I saved you from this afternoon, he sure wanted to be near you. It was me that shot him. He'd have dragged you off for sure. A woman ought to be a little more grateful. You wouldn't like living in a tepee. [grunts] What makes you so precious? I know about you, Miss Linda Lee. I know what you really are. You're no singer. [grunts] Greer. You stay out of this! If it's her morals you're worrying about, she ain't got any. [grunting] [sighs] Thank you. He's right, you know. I'm not a singer. I said I was because I was ashamed to admit it. I didn't want anybody to know. I'm a... a mail-order bride. There's nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with a woman desperate enough to marry a man she's never met? I'll try and fix this bed. It just seems so humiliating. You know, it doesn't make sense. A woman who's as beautiful as you are having to get a husband from a mail-order catalog. There's got to be a reason for it. [sighs] There is. That's something that's even harder to admit. You don't want to talk about it, don't. My mother died some time ago. After that, I went to Europe, lived a few years abroad. When I came back, I moved in with my father. He wasn't rich, but he was, well, what you might call well-to-do. And in St. Louis, at least, we were considered to be social. [chuckles] I became engaged. Well, then he was social. Yes. Then my father was charged with an embezzlement. And rather than face the charges, he... hung himself. And did your fiance break off the engagement? Yes. And all my social friends broke off their friendships. Well, that's the trouble with social people. They can be so... unsocial. What possessions my father had were sold to pay off his theft. I was destitute. [sighs] Then I saw an ad for mail-order brides. Ha. The Rudy Reese Agency in San Francisco. So I answered it. Soon I found myself corresponding with a lonesome gentleman by the name of Brooks. And that seemed to be the answer to everything, huh? That new start you were talking about in a place where nobody knows you. That's nothing to be ashamed of. Oh, but it is. It isn't love. It's someplace to run to and hide. Well, I'm not going through with it. I don't know what will become of me, but I don't think I really care. I'm sick of lying to everybody about the San Francisco Opera House or anything else. Miss Lee... I care. If it matters. Oh, yes, it does. Thank you. Night. - [gunshots] - [whooping] - [horse whinnies] - [gunshots] [gunshots continue] I told you this bank was flat busted. All we got was silver. [gunshots continue] Dajin! I told you to wait at the fort till we got back. But two men came in there snooping around. - Well, you got 'em locked up? - I had 'em locked up, but... You let 'em get away! Oh, no, Dajin. They busted out. Me and Sarge tried to stop 'em. Sarge got killed. And what did you do? You run off like a scared chicken, didn't ya? No, Keaton's still there. You run out on Keaton. So as I could find you and tell ya about 'em. Three of ya. I leave three of ya there. You can't even take care of two solitary men. They'd have killed me, Dajin. That would have just saved me the bother. No, Dajin! No! You and Sarge and Keaton, you haven't got the sand to ride with the rest of us. We're heading back to the fort to kill us a couple of nosy visitors. Here. If they're already left when we get there, we're gonna run 'em down so they don't go blabbing off their mouths what happened there. After yesterday's hell out there on the prairie, I have to tell you the danger we face is not yet over. It's only beginning. That band of renegade Indians may attack us here. But there's another, more immediate danger. A band of marauders, army deserters led by a man named Dajin, are undoubtedly on the way to this fort. [sighs] I thought we'd seen the end of killing, death. With Eli Jonas for wagon master, there ain't never gonna be no end to nothing! Now these men will try to kill us. - Now to defend ourselves... - We gotta try and kill them first. - That's right, Greer. - Hmm. [Stokes] With one exception. Dajin, the man himself. Now as an Indian agent for the United States government, it's my job to take him alive. [scoffs] That should be real easy. Picking out one man from the whole bunch. Nobody said it'd be easy. May not even be possible. But the Indians want Dajin. And if they can get him, there's a slim outside chance that we can have peace again, and the rest of us can get out of here alive. You men will be issued the same repeating rifles we used yesterday. And we'll be repeating the same dying as yesterday. You got a big mouth, Greer. The little lady sing for you last night? Don't push it, Greer. Or did she break down and tell you the truth? She ain't got no contract with no opera company. - [gasps] - I told him. Ask her about the real contract she's got. [laughs] It's with the biggest, fanciest pleasure house in San Francisco. Ask her. Go ahead and ask her. The Rudy Reese Agency. It was exposed in all the newspapers. That's my letter. You dropped it the first day the wagon train was out of St. Louis. I picked it up. They recruit these girlies in the East and on the way west. Just so folks don't wag their tongues, these girlies pretend to be mail-order brides. Only she did 'em one better. She claimed to be an opera singer. Keep your filthy mouth shut, Greer! You keep it shut, or I'll fill it full of desert! Horn, you got to listen. Horn, he's right about the Rudy Reese Agency. It is a big syndicate for so-called fancy saloon women. I told you! - There is something you ought to know. - I had her pegged! Many of these women wrote to men in San Francisco and got letters back. And they honestly believe they're going west to get married. Not her. She was wise to what was waiting in San Francisco. - Greer, you don't know that. - Huh! I know people! And especially people like her! Greer, ever know any people like me? Jonas told me that most of the women didn't even know what the Rudy Reese Agency was. But others did know. I imagine they got to San Francisco and... You'll never know which I was. Well, I'm not asking. Or for that matter about my life in St. Louis, that could be a lie too. Like I'm a lyric soprano. You'll never know for sure about my past. [chuckles] You'll never know about mine either. So that makes us even. But it isn't even. It's different for a woman. A man doesn't want a woman who's... Who talks too much. I guess I do. You're always trying to explain yourself. Then you do the explaining. The only important thing is that wherever we've come from, whatever happened there... we're not going back anymore. You explain it so beautifully. And we're not gonna talk about it anymore either. Not if you don't want to, but we... Ah. No mas. I say no. [gun clatters on ground] And that's what I say about fighting somebody else's private war. - You're staying, Greer. - Uh-uh. I aim to hitch up that team to that wagon and get out of here. The only thing you're hitching up is them baggy pants of yours. Look, Stokes, you're not stopping me anymore than he is. It's suicide staying here. At least out there in the open we can make a run for it. A bunch of renegade marauders ain't no better than them Indians. I say we hitch up this wagon and get out of here while we still can! I'm the boss of the wagon train. What wagon train? You lost your wagon train! And from what I hear, you lost the one before that. I've made the decision. We're staying. You're through making decisions! Does that mean you're making 'em now? We'll take a vote on it. Hey, Tyler! You want to stay here and take a chance on dying... Or do you want to leave here and die for sure? I ain't hankerin' to die at all. Well, make up your stupid mind! Let's take that vote. Whoever's in favor of staying here, raise your hands. - I'll go alone. - Not on one of our horses you don't. If you want to leave here so damn bad, climb over that wall and start walking. Otherwise, pick up that rifle and stand ready to use it. Whoa! Well... they're waitin' for us. Let's go. They're here! All right, you women inside! All of you, inside! Come down out of there. You could help someplace else. [gunshots continue] - Looks like we got him. - Better look again. Well, he said there were only two of them there. What are we waiting for? Whoa! Hold! [gunshots continue] Hold you fire! It ain't over. It ain't gonna be that easy. Just didn't know how many of us were here. Well, he does now. Where'd they all come from? Thing we got to worry about is they don't get out of that fort alive. They'd report on us for sure. They must know about how we killed them soldiers. Not to say anything of the second massacre when we killed all them squaws and their kids. We didn't know what we'd find in that Indian village! Them Indian braves didn't know what they'd find when they got there either. Yeah, but thanks to you they know who they're looking for now, don't they? I was just yelling "Let's get out of here!" "Dajin! Dajin! Dajin!" That's all you kept yelling! That ain't helping our problem none now. All right, boys, spread out. Make sure none of them get out of that fort alive. Ah, there ain't no sign of 'em. Maybe... Maybe they've pulled out. Not a chance. The way we flashed them, maybe they think another army garrison moved in. The only other army garrison anywhere around here Dajin and his men buried in a common grave. Why don't they attack again? Why don't you talk louder. Maybe they'll hear ya. Nothing I'd like better than to see them coming straight at us again. They're probably figurin' there's more than one way of skinning a fort. Yeah, it's skinning us. You should have let me go when I wanted to. Indians, you say. Those Indians are long gone by now. Hey, Tom! I think I see a couple of them deserters! They're still too far for me to get a bead on 'em! Jonas, take the back by the stockade. Tyler, the east wall. Greer... Yeah, I'll cover the Indians that ain't nowhere around here. [thudding] - Greer, get back where I posted ya! - What happened? That's just what they want, to have us running around in circles. - Get back to your position! - They've got Tyler. You only winged him. Thanks. But you keep watch out there! What do you think I've been doing? You ought to know by now I got eyes in both sides of my head. The boys must have got them all. Them that they didn't get, we'll get. Let's go. Hyah! Jonas! [gunshots continue] [gunshots continue] [groans] [gunshots continue] - The arm again, huh? - Same damn spot. [gunshots continue] [hammer cocks] Get back inside! I want to help! There are a couple of wounded men back there! Help them! You in the fort, open the gates! We surrender! Let us in! - We belong in that fort! We're soldiers! - [Indians whooping] I'm Sergeant Dajin! Let them take his hide. It's Dajin, only they don't know it. [whooping continues] With them Indians on a rampage like that, they ain't gonna stop for nothing, no matter what. For God's sakes, let us in! The only chance is to turn Dajin over to them. We've got women to protect. Open up the gate. I'll stay here and try to reason with them. - Wait a minute, Ben, you can't... - Now look. I'm the Indian agent, ain't I? I'm the only one they'll recognize. Maybe they'll listen to me. [whooping] I'm Sergeant Dajin! Them Indians want our hide! [whooping] For God sakes! Let us in! [whooping continues] - Come on! Hurry up! - Git! Indians and outlaws both at our throats. Good. Thanks. Now drop those guns. Hey, aim that at those Indians out there. Drop 'em. [whooping continues] Listen, we got Indians to fight. You've got Indians to fight. What's he think he's doing? We've got Dajin! It's Dajin you want, not any one of us! Oh, no, you don't! You ain't giving me to them Indians. [hammer cocks] We'll turn Dajin over to you! Get Dajin's horse. Dajin's dead. Dead? - They want him alive. - So did I. Damn it, they expect to see him riding out of here on a horse! Well, let's not disappoint them. I don't know what they'll do if they'll think this is a trick. We better hope they don't. [speaking native language] They suckered us out of the fort. Well, you ornery old coot... It's been nice knowing you too. - [gunshots] - [screams] [speaking native language] Well, I'll be. He's dead for sure now. Appreciate you takin' us all the way to Casper. I should be in shape to drive the team by then. I hope so. 'Cause that's where Miss Lee and I are getting off. Well, you ornery old... Coot. Coot. I know. You know, the last time you said that to me them Indians was holding a gun on us. And you're going back to wet-nursing them, huh? Well, like you said once before, Tom, I guess it's the only game in town. Best friend I ever had. You have a new friend now. Hyah!
