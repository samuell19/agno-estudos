Oh! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you, but, are you all right, Miss? Why, yes, I'm just sleepy. I've been driving all night. Oh, for a minute I thought there was something wrong. Well, there is with my car and I'm in an awful hurry. What seems to be the trouble? I don't know, it just stopped and it won't go again. You're not out of gas, are you? No, I've got half a tank. - Well, let's take a look. - Thank you. You're a Mountie, aren't you? That's right. I thought I recognized the uniform. Of course, I've only seen it in movies. Say, tell me, is this 'always gets his man' stuff true, or just a lot of movie hokum? That happens to be the motto of the service. Oh, how noble. Well, where's your man, or didn't you get him yet? Have you got any tools? Oh, sure. A screwdriver, is that all? How many do you need? Why don't you get a rope and tow me in? Mike's not a plow horse, he's a saddle horse. Well, then, why don't you get in the saddle and ride to the nearest garage and have them tow me in? There isn't a garage within a day's ride from here. Step on the starter, will you, please? I'd be delighted, but it won't do any good I've tried that for hours. It could be the carburetor needs adjusting for this high altitude. Will you try it, please? It's a waste of time, Mountie. Why don't you stick to horses? Now, try it. Well, hooray. Thank you. Don't mention it. You know, a girl like you shouldn't be out in this part of the country alone. Oh, I don't know. They told me if I got into any trouble, all I had to do was whistle and a Mountie'd pop up. I didn't even have to whistle this time, did I? Bye. I'm not concerned about his safety. I just want to get to him as soon as possible. Yes, well, that's perfectly natural, I understand. Reporting back, sir. How'd you make out, O'Brien? They were tucked in near Madison Lake. And? Unfortunately, I had to kill them, sir. Resisted arrest? Definitely. They both pulled guns and tried to shoot their way clear. Too bad. Ordinarily, Miss Owens, we try to take 'em alive, but this gang has murdered three men and I told O'Brien not to take any chances. If there's nothing else, sir, I'll go take care of my horse. Wait a minute. Miss Owens, this is Trooper O'Brien. We've already met, sir. Yes, so we have. I guess I forgot to mention it. You forgot your screwdriver, too, Miss Owens. Oh, thank you. I'm sorry, I was in a bad mood. You see, my car stalled and Trooper O'Brien was nice enough to fix it. Oh, well, fixing a car or delivering a baby, it's all in a day's work to a Canadian Mounted Policeman. Miss Owens wants to go up to Canoga Valley to visit her uncle. He packed in there with some engineers about four months ago to survey some timberland. That's one place you can't drive your car to, Miss Owens. - Oh, why not? - It's very rough country. Ah, but we can lend you a horse and some equipment. You'll need a guide, too. I'd appreciate it. Uh, Roberts would be a fine man for that, sir. He knows that country backwards. Yes, I'd send Roberts, but he's out Salmon River way. How about Whitney, sir? Oh no, he went back East, left two days ago. Well, if... No, I'm afraid it's up to you. I wanted to send you to Canoga Valley anyhow. I've only had one report from Sergeant Means since he was transferred up there. You know Means? Only by reputation, sir. Little hard to get along with. Cracked up in the war. I want you to check on him. Yes, sir. Anything else, sir? Yes, I want you to hear this. To the Mounted Police of Chinook Pass. Dear sir, beg to announce that the creek that used to flow past my place don't flow anymore. It used to be full of water and fish, now it's full of rocks and sand. This is very serious to me and my horses. Please to investigate this. I already spoke to the Mountie in this section, but he ain't done nothing about it so far. Please get it fixed PDQ, thanks. Signed, Poodles Hanneford. P.S. I'd fix it myself, but every time I go upstream somebody takes a shot at me. Hoping you are the same, Poodles. Now you'd better show this to Means and find out what it's all about. Yes, sir. What horse should I saddle for Miss Owens? Uh, take Duke. What part of the valley do you wanna go to, Miss Owens? A place called Morgan's Post. Be ready to leave first thing in the morning. Yes, sir. I'd like to go this afternoon. Well, that's up to O'Brien. Well, it'll take me 35 minutes to re-shoe my horse and about 10 minutes to pack and saddle. Of course, I never sleep. 45 minutes, that would be fine, I'll be ready. Thank you, Inspector. Pleasure, Miss. Oh, I'll try not to be too much trouble. I'm sure you will. What did I ever do to you, Mac? I thought I was giving you a break. If I were 10 years younger I'd take her myself. Well, I sure wish you were 10 years younger. What do you say, Mr. Owens? Hello, Pierre. What you say about the money, huh? Yeah, when do we get paid? Now, stop worrying. I give you my word the $20,000 dollars will be here tomorrow, maybe even this afternoon. - Who's bringing it? - My niece. - Alone? - Yes. All that dough? - That's right. - Sacre bleu, Mr. Owens! You are, how you say it? You are nuts! Morgan, give me a shot of bourbon. What'll you have, boys? Yeah, make mine a double. What are you gonna do with those? Just hang 'em over the saddle horn. Oh, just a minute, I'll take this one. Let's go. You'll be more comfortable if you take your boots off. We always sleep with our feet to the fire. Just a minute, where do I sleep? Right there. Where do you sleep? Right here. How cozy. Don't forget, feet to the fire. If you're about finished, I'll go water the horses. Alright. Trooper O'Brien! Trooper! Trooper O'Brien! What's the matter now, did you see a snake or something? Yes, and he was on a horse! As long as he wasn't on a bicycle. Listen, I traveled 1500 miles alone without a mishap. And now that I'm under the protection of a Royal Canadian Mountie I'm robbed! Robbed, of what? Of my small bag! - Are you kidding? - No, I'm not kidding! Do you see it anywhere? If you keep on chatting about it all day, he'll be over that second ridge of mountains. Here he comes, Whitey. That's the man who stole my bag, but I can't find it anywhere. Whoever shot him must have taken it. But I've gotta get it back, it's important! What was in it that's so important? - It's got... - What? Well, what does a girl generally carry in her bag? I wouldn't know. Well, that's what was in it. - That doesn't make sense. - What doesn't? That a man should be killed over a bag of women's uh, er... Listen, Miss Owens, this is no time for comedy. What was in that bag? Money. How much? $20,000 dollars. $20,000? Why didn't you tell me I've been escorting a traveling bank? Because it was none of your business! It certainly was my business and it will be till I recover it, come on! I'm sorry, Miss Owens, but that horse is too lame for you to ride any further. What do we do now, stay here till he gets well? There's only one thing we can do, ride double. Thank you, I'd just as soon walk. We've still got 15 miles to go. - That far? - That's right. I'd still rather walk. Suit yourself. Hey, wait a minute! What's the matter? Well, how do I get across here? I thought you said something about walking? Okay, you win. Come and get me. Beats walkin', doesn't it? What in the world is that? I don't know, they must be circus folks. I wonder what they're doing in this neck of the woods? That's better! Good morning. Good morning! The little lady's quite a fancy rider. Jill be the best bareback rider in the world after I get through training her. Dad, was the top rider in the circuses for years. What are you folks doing in this part of the country? Doctor ordered me a long rest after I got all smashed up in a fall. Oh, I see. How far is Morgan's Post? About 10 miles. You can't miss it if you keep straight on this trail. Oh, I wonder whether you'd rent me one of your horses? Well, we couldn't let you have Prince. He's strictly a rosinback, not broken to the saddle. I suppose we could let her have Bullet. That's providing you can ride him. I'll take my chances. Okay, come along. I've got a lame horse here. I'm gonna leave him with you for a couple of days. I'll take care of him for you. And what's more, I'll fix his leg. Fair enough. Don't worry about Bullet and me, we'll get along fine. I'm Trooper O'Brien from Chinook. I'll be responsible for your horse. Chinook? I sent a letter there about my creek. Then you must be Mr. Hanneford? Sure! That's my daughter, Jill. - How do you do? - Hello. Say, how about my creek? I'll look into that on the way back, Mr. Hanneford. Alright. Say, here's your suitcase. And don't worry about your horse. I'm not worried about my horse. It's the water that ain't in the creek that bothers me. - Bye! - Goodbye! Thank you! Bye! - Hey, Dutch? - Yeah? We got a new copper. Yeah, that must be John Owens' niece with him. Can you tell me where I can find John Owens? John Owens? Why, yeah, that's his cabin right over there. Thanks. Uncle John! Yoohoo, Uncle John! Hello! Kate, you're a wonder girl, I knew you'd make it! Well, I almost didn't. This is Trooper O'Brien, he chaperoned me up here. How are you, Trooper? I'm afraid I didn't do a very good job of it, sir. Your niece was robbed on the way up here. Robbed? - Did they get the... - They got every cent. Well, what kind of a mounted policeman are you to stand by and let a... Just a second, Mr. Owens. If your niece had told me she was carrying that much money it never would have happened. Do you suppose he'll recognize us? No, he never got close enough to see our faces. Just the same, he's one Mountie too many in this valley to suit me. Well, that puts me in a fine spot with Pierre here. He's the man I'm buying the timberland from. Maybe if you don't get money quick you no buy at all, huh? Can I help what happened? Now don't worry, I'll send for more money right away. Well, you catch money quick. I cannot wait much longer to close deal. Well, you see the position it puts me in. He's liable to walk out of the whole deal unless I pick up my option right away. I understand you wanted this money in small bills, why? Because Pierre doesn't like large ones. He's like most of the people up in this section. One more thing, Mr. Owens. Did anyone around here know your niece was bringing this money to you? Yes, all of my men did. Part of it was for their pay. But I'm sure they're all trustworthy. Maybe so, but I'm sure Sergeant Means will know more about that. Well, thank you for bringing me up here. I won't forget the trip for a long time. Neither will I. - I'll take it. - Awfully sorry about this. Not half as sorry as I'll be if this deal doesn't go through. I'll bet five. I'll call. Beats me. I'll call. Three queens. Three aces. That's to the jack, boys. Alright, deal me out the next hand. I'm gonna get a fresh pack. - Your deal, Sandy. - Alright. - What are you doing? - Nothing. How many times have I told you to keep your nose out of my business? Now look, get out! And stay out. Why, you! I oughta cut your throat! What's going on here? This man's a little free with his knife, Sergeant. Oh, beating your wife again, eh, Whitey? Yes, Sergeant. - He was afraid that I... - Shut up! That'll do. Go over to my office and wait for me. See this doesn't happen again. Come on, Trooper. I take it you're Sergeant Means, sir. That's correct. Trooper O'Brien from Chinook. What brings you here? Inspector McGrath's orders. I accompanied Mr. Owens' niece up here and was also told to investigate the complaint of a homesteader, a Mr. Hanneford. About his creek drying up? That's right, Sergeant. Well, you can go back and reassure the Inspector. It's just a case of the spring that feeds the creek pinching off. But I understand someone's been shooting at him. Well, he's been trespassing. - I warned him about that. - I see. The Inspector's also been worried about you, Sergeant. He hasn't had a report for two or three months. What's he want me to do, write him some love letters? We haven't had any trouble up here. None worth reporting. There's another matter, sir. Yes? Miss Owens was robbed of $20,000 dollars on our way up here. - Is that so? - Yes, sir. Not very flattering to you, O'Brien. No, it isn't, sir. With your permission I'd like to stay here and... Never mind. I'd like to lend a hand, sir. Not necessary. Return to your station and just hope that the Inspector won't break you for what's happened. Yes, sir. I was hoping you might stay around till I was ready to go back. What, and take a chance on being robbed again? I know that wasn't your fault. You're the only one who doesn't think so, thanks. Oh, by the way, if you happen to meet any young ladies asleep in cars, don't wake them up. Don't worry. Hello, there. Hello, back so soon? A lot sooner than I expected. By the way, I found out why there's no more water in your creek, Mr. Hanneford. Sergeant Means tells me the spring that feeds it went dry. That's what he told me. But I couldn't find out for myself. What do you mean? Every time I step out to follow the creek up to the timberland somebody takes a shot at me. What did Sergeant Means say about that? Well, he said that the timberland was private property and that I was trespassing. It all sure sounds phony to me. Nobody ever took a shot at me before the creek went dry. - Is that so? - Yeah. Maybe I'd better take a run up there. Which way is it? Why, it's right up there, the other side of the hill. Wait, I'll go along and show you. Alright, I've got a horse all saddled for you. Oh, no, oh, no! No, no, that's Bullet. He's bucked me off three times already. I'll stick to old Prince. Miss Hanneford, would you please take care of Bullet? Sure, I'll take him back to the barn. Thanks. Well, there it is and it used to be plumb full of trout, too. Let's follow it on up. Looks like I've lost him, Poodles. Yes, and you almost lost me, too! Around behind. Maybe so. You go inside and keep the boys amused. I'll take a look. I'll do my best, but I ain't promising. Hello, folks! Hello, there. And you, Mr. Morgan! How are you, Mr. Hanneford? Say, would you like to see a little trick in magic? That I would. And you gentlemen, would you like to see a little trick of magic? Sure! I'll show it to you. Now here we are. What color are those handkerchiefs, gentlemen? Green and orange! I think you're wrong. Now what color are they? Green and orange! I still think you're wrong. Mr. Hanneford, would you mind showing me how to do that trick for myself? For you Mr. Morgan, a private performance. What are the colors of those handkerchiefs now? Green and orange. Mr. Morgan, you're wrong. That's a very clever trick, Mr. Hanneford. Enough of that, Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan, I will now show you a trick that you have never seen before. I'll be very interested in watching you. Right, gentlemen, gentlemen! Watch this trick, please, everybody! Everybody watch this! Mr. Morgan, will you buy me a drink if I drink it from here? I beg your pardon, Mr. Hanneford. Would you say that again? Will you buy me a drink if I drink it from here? Naturally, I shall. If you can do that trick I shall buy you a big slug of bourbon! Good. Gentlemen, watch this. To your health, Mr. Morgan! Well, strike me pink! Hello. Well, hello! I thought you'd be back at your station by now. - Well, I would have been... - Don't tell me - you came back on my account? - Well, yes and no. Did you ever see this before? Handle of a bag? Do you think it could be off your bag, the one that was stolen? It could. Where'd you find it? In the ash heap in back of Whitey's. That means someone around here stole the money. That's right. Well, that's hard to believe. I'd better someone about... Don't mention this to anyone, not even your uncle. 'Cause I want to go back and... Excuse me a minute. Just a second. I wanna ask you a few questions. It won't do you any good. Someone burned a traveling bag in your stove. - Who was it? - It ain't my stove. Anyhow, I don't know and I'd be afraid to tell you if I did. There's nothing to be afraid of. Oh yes, there is. We're being followed right now. I know it, just keep walking. Alright, Whitey! Drop it! That's an old trick, Whitey. I wasn't sure you'd fall for it. Roll you were carrying. You've got some explaining to do. Start walking. Sergeant, I think this man is connected with the robbery of Miss Owens. That's a lie, I didn't steal any money from anybody! What makes you think so? The stolen money was in new $10 and $20 dollar bills. Take a look at these. I took 'em out of his pocket. What's more, Miss Owens has identified this handle as the one that was on her bag. Someone burned the stolen bag in the stove over at the post. That's certainly a new angle on the case. Where did you get this money? I won it in a crap game. From whom? From a Yank who drove by a couple of days ago. He looked like a prospector. I don't even remember his name. I can easily verify that. On the other hand, O'Brien, I'm not used to having my orders disobeyed. How come you didn't return to your station? I started back, sir, and someone took a shot at me. While trying to find out who it was I stumbled onto a clue to the robbery. Why didn't you tell me this? I didn't have a chance. Things happened too fast. Well, I must congratulate you on your work. But my order still stands. Return to your station. I'll take charge of this man and the investigation from here on. - Is that clear? - Yes, sir. Did you find anything out? Yes, I think I did. I just had a run-in with a fella named Whitey Yeager. He was carrying a large roll of bills on him. I think it's part of your uncle's money. What are you going to do now? Go back to my station. Go back, without clearing it up? There's nothing I can do about it. Sergeant Means insists on handling the investigation alone. He's ordered me back to Chinook. Ordered, doesn't that seem very peculiar? Well, no, I've had peculiar orders before. Such as chaperoning peculiar females? I've had worse than that. Really? That wasn't so bad. In fact, at times I almost enjoyed it. You don't say? It's going to be very dull going back alone. I won't mind it a bit. Oh, but I will. Well, when you're ready to leave, why don't you whistle? Maybe another mounted policeman will show up. - Did you find out anything? - Plenty. I think the men who robbed Miss Owens are right here. Come on, I'll tell you about it on the way back. Come on, git up, git up! We're coming near to the place where they took a shot at me. Listen! It ain't nothing but a plane. Yeah, do they fly over here very often? I hear them two or three times a week. Is that right? Sounds like he's coming in for a landing. Never know no planes to land here in the valley. Throw a couple of shots over there, Poodles, and keep 'em busy. Drop it! What's the idea, shootin' at us? This is my land and I want no trespassers. So you've got a roll of new $10 dollar bills, too, huh? Yeah, what's that got to do with trespassing? Not a thing, but where did you get 'em? I play dice. You must have been in the same game as Whitey. Gold dust? Yeah. I suppose you won this in the dice game, too? Oh, sure, sure, I win! Oh no, you don't. You lose. Stick out your hands. Alright, you, get off. What's the trouble, Pierre? You tell this Mountie I got right to shoot to keep fellas off my land. Well, of course, you have. Didn't you see his signs warning trespassers off, O'Brien? The police aren't trespassers, Mr. Owens. I no shoot at you, I shoot at him. Yes, and you darn near hit me! Take it easy, Poodles. You make him let me go or the timberland deal is off. - You understand? - Now, wait a minute, Pierre, we'll get this straightened out. - Look here, O'Brien... - Sorry, Mr. Owens. Come on, you, inside. - You got a gun, Morgan? - Yes, sir. Get it. Yes, sir. Here. I want you to keep an eye on this man and turn him over to Sergeant Means when he gets here. Keep him for the Sergeant, huh? - That's right. - Right. Now I know why they've been shooting at you every time you went upstream. I got an idea, too. - That gold. - Exactly. That's why your stream went dry, Poodles. They've been using the water to wash sand. Could be. Let's take a ride up there. Frenchie, you've got to get up there and warn the boys that the Mountie's on the way to the diggings. Sure, sure, get these handcuffs off me. Right. You do just as I tell you, Frenchie. Now hold them down tight. You just have to hold. Now get ahold of it tight, Frenchie. This time I fix that Mountie so he don't stick his nose in our business no more. You better go warn the boys, first. You may need some help. Don't worry, I fix. That sounds like a plane warming up over there. Yeah. You follow the stream bed on up, Poodles. Alright. I'm going over to have a look at that plane. - Good. - See ya later. Whitey, that Mountie's on the way up like the dickens! Dutch, you go tip off the boss. Come on, Pierre, we'll get him. I go down and finish him. Matt, I thought you'd been killed! Are you alright? Why, sure, I'm alright. What are you doing here? I heard Pierre was out to get you so I... I left Pierre locked up at the post. We're going back and have a few explanations. Here, boy! Come on down here! Matt, I wish you'd tell me what this is all about. I'm a little foggy about it myself. But I'm gonna talk to someone who should be able to clear everything up. Meanwhile, you wait for me at Hannefords. Oh, nothing doing, you'll only stick your chin out again. You know, at times you're a very obstinate young woman. Doggone it, I've been looking all over for you, O'Brien. Am I glad you showed up. I want you to take this stubborn young lady back to your ranch and keep her there. Well, I won't go and that's all there is to it! I've got another pair of handcuffs. Matt O'Brien, you're the most unreasonable man I ever met! Better come alone as the law says. Or I may have to shoot your ears off. And he's not kidding. He's just the type that would do it. - Hurry up and fix my arm. - Fix it yourself! I told you I was through, Whitey and I mean it. I stood for all your dirty crookedness. But when it comes to murder... What do you mean by that? I found a grave in the woods this morning. Who's buried in it? How should I know? I found your lucky piece right next to it. See? What's your next move? Are you gonna squeal to the Mounties? No, I'm not, but I'm getting out. Drop that gun or I'll shoot. Is he dead? Yes. Then listen, Mountie, there's something you ought to know. He and Olie and Dutch... Mr. Owens? Well, what's the matter now? Your niece wants to see you, Mr. Owens. She's over at the Hanneford ranch. What's happened, did she have an accident? Well, not exactly, but you'd better come over and see her. Well, can't you tell me what happened? Not here, but I'll ride over with you. Okay, I'll be ready in a minute. Good, I'll be right back. Did the Sergeant pick up my prisoner, Morgan? Well, uh, well, not exactly. You see, uh, before the Sergeant got here I had to go out and chop some wood. And while I was gone and before I got... And when you came back he'd escaped, huh? That's right, he vanished into thin air. Well, it doesn't matter now. Listen, Morgan, if I gave you a message for Sergeant Means do you think you can keep it in your mind until you see him? I'll write it down. Fine, write this, I just arrested Mr. Owens and I'm taking him over to Hannefords. My word, that is a fine kettle of fish. Let's go. It looks simply amazing! Oh, that's wonderful! Can I try it once? Why, certainly, try it, but be careful now. You gotta be careful. Kate, look out! You might have broken your neck! I'm gonna leave circus riding to Jill. Matt tell you what happened? I haven't told your uncle anything yet. No, he said you wanted to see me. I didn't say that. Well, that's funny, I thought you did. I hope you haven't arrested him, too. No, but I'm doing that right now. You're not kidding me? No, and you're not kidding me, Mr. Owens. - You're under arrest. - Are you serious? I was never more serious in my life. He didn't come up here to buy timberland. He brought a gang of thugs up here to work some rich plaster claims. - That's a lie! - Of course, it is! What do you call stealing gold from the Canadian government and smuggling it across the border? I don't believe a word of it! Come on inside. Uncle John, don't let him talk to you like this, - it's ridiculous! - Don't worry, everything will be alright. Sit down! I'll get Sergeant Means, he'll stop this nonsense. You'll stay right here. Sit down. The reason Hanneford's creek went dry is because your uncle and his gang diverted it to use for their washing trays. If you hadn't been so busy rescuing me yesterday you'd have seen those trays and the rest of their equipment in the ravine. I suppose that plane was part of their plan. I can't figure it out. They've been flying supplies and materials in and flying the gold dust out. Isn't that right, Mr. Owens? Is it? I think so. The fellow held you up yesterday and the pair that killed him are all part of your uncle's outfit. Working a double cross. I don't believe that, O'Brien. You weren't in on that. But I'll prove it as soon as Sergeant Means gets here. As for Pierre, he was a French-Canadian who originally discovered the claim, but there were government restrictions against working it. So, he went to the States and contacted your uncle. I can't believe that. Why don't you ask him whether it's true or not? Tell him he's got it all wrong. Here comes Sergeant Means. O'Brien, what are you trying to pull off here? That's what I'd like to know! - Didn't Morgan tell you? - He told me enough. I'm sorry about this, Mr. Owens. You're guilty of insubordination, O'Brien. I ordered you to return to your station. Now I'm placing you under arrest. You're not placing me under arrest for anything. 'Cause I'm placing you under arrest for murder. For the murder of Sergeant Means, the man you're impersonating. Get his gun, Poodles. What do you think? Shall we close in? No, let's wait and see what happens. I didn't know the real Sergeant Means personally, but I do know that during the first World War he had a finger shot off his left hand. I just saw the real Sergeant Means' body. He's been buried in back of Whitey Yeager's place. Well, I guess that's that. Mind if I get my hat? Get away from that door! So you brought some of your boys with you, huh? Well, that's fine. We'll get 'em all at once. Let's go! Hold it! Drop those guns! Alright, get over here! Come on. Alright, Poodles, bring 'em out! Come on, let's go. Come on, come on! Come on, get in there! Come on, get over there, get over! Thanks, Sergeant Means, for bringing these men over here. You saved me a lot of trouble. Now Mr. Owens, when I pick up Morgan at the post, that'll put an end to your little racket. Uh, you want me over there, too? No, I think I'll put you on probation. What're you stopping for? This. Well! You see? It isn't only a Mountie who always gets his man.
