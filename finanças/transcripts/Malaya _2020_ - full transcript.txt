[song plays] Malaya, did you find me good leather today? I want good leather that’s soft, smooth, compact and has a good smell. I did, yes. I suggest we use this leather for the bags. Very good, Malaya. Good choice! - You are learning fast. - Thank you, Signora. Daniela, we have to rush to our meeting. We're off now, Grace. Please help Malaya around, okay? - I’ll see you later. - Yes, Signora. Thank you, Malaya. Thanks for the coffee, Grace. You're welcome. I'm really glad she approved it. Luckily, we have similar tastes. - You sure look happy. - Yes. I sure am. Anyway, I have to go now. Bye, Miss Grace! [song playing] - Miss. - Oh, my god! Bubbles. Bubbles! [giggles happily] [giggles] [moans playfully] [laughing] Bubbles... Your hair still smells the same. It smells like fruit. Knock it off! - Like overripe fruit! - Stop it! You're so mean! And you look like you haven’t showered in days. You stink. You know? - Do I? - You really do...! - See for yourself, then. - [giggles uncontrollably] - Here you go! - Bubbles, no! Bubbles...! [giggles uncontrollably] You still stink! Obviously, you guys missed each other. By the way Carlo, this is my friend, Laya. Hello, I’m Carlo. A pleasure to meet you. Hello, I’m Malaya. - He's Carlo, Mama Rosa's son. - I see! How long have you known each other? Well, Laya is... Go on. Let’s put it this way. You are my best buddy here, while Laya here is my closest Filipina friend. Are you kidding me, punk? [teasing] I'm serious, Laya and I go way back. Yeah, alright. I’ll leave you two to it, then. I'll see you around, okay? - Bye, dude. Behave. - Bye. See you, Laya. - What? - How are you? I’m good. How are you, Iago? I’m alright. You sure surprised me. I sure did. Never change, Iago. Come in. Don’t worry. Mom's not here. She's sleeping over at Signora’s house. - Come in. - Alright. [scoffs] Too bad, though... She can't drive me out of the house. [scoffs] [door closes] Why does she hate me, anyway? She doesn't like the way you look at me. She warned me about men who can’t look you straight in the eye. “They have dark intentions,” she says. Well, "dark" is right. But "dark intentions”? Not really. Wine? Sure. So... You're actually a Blondie? Silly. This place belongs to Mom's employer. She was kind enough to let us live here. We don't have beer, sorry. Mom's not a beer drinker. But this wine from Signora is pretty good. I’m getting married. [huffs] [huffs] Are you asking my permission... Or my approval? What do you think? [breathes sharply] Why didn't you tell me this sooner? I want you... ...to be our bridal sponsor. Very funny, you jerk. [sobs] [sobs] [sobs] [sobs] [sobs] [song plays] [phone ringing] Hello. Is this Santiago, the mechanic? Yes, this is Santiago. Can you help... ...with uh, boat? Do you understand? Boat. [whispers] Boat. Boat. - Yes. - Wow, Mom! You finally made bulalo. I've been craving for beef lately. Laya's been here for six months, and all this time, we've had nothing but adobo. Laya's employer is looking for a mechanic. Could you please help her find one? Go on, she needs to make a good impression. No. A part of... I need a mechanic to make sure that the boat is in good condition. It's stationed at Polignano a Mare port. Yes. Can you text me the exact location? Of course. Yes. Thank you! [squeaks] Finally! Did you hit your target? [huffs] No. [huffs] I have a long way to go. I have to be able to make around 3,000 euros before I can get my own place. Why don't you go back to your old man's? It’s free rent! We've all done stupid things, but you know... I'm not stupid. Bye. Hello. Good Morning! I got fresh fish for you, Mama Rosa. I made orecchiette. - Help yourself, Iago. - Thank you. Delicious! Once you're done, could you please take out your laundry? Papa, can I borrow some tools? Go ahead. They’re in the toolbox over there. Thank you. Have you talked to your father yet? Not yet, Papa. When do you plan to do it? You have to talk to him, Iago. You have to be patient with him. Anyway, you're family here. Stay as long as you like. - Okay? - Thank you, Papa. - Good day, Laya. - Good day. Here’s the key to the boat. You were highly recommended by our Filipino helper. I'm counting on you. Do you understand? I understand. Okay... [reads Italian aloud] Good morning. Good morning. - You must be Santiago. - Yes. Nice to meet you. Thank you. I'm Laya. Uh, I need help... Uh, cracks... in, the boat...? I mean... Well... For tomorrow...? Uh... [phone rings] Wait... [phone rings] - Can you hold this, please? - [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Hello. Maki, you said? Nelson said this guy's a Filipino? But he’s an “I”! A flat-nosed Italian. Go talk to him, okay? I'm going crazy right now. Here... Telephone... Talk to the... ...him. Sure. I got this, don't worry. Yes. Uh, excuse me. I--inside. You, outside. I, in. You, out. I clean. Got it. Santiago? [clears throat] [snickers] I’m starving. [birds chirping] [birds chirping] Mmm...delicious! [silly music plays] You jerk! You know how to speak Filipino! Stop laughing! You knew I was having a hard time, okay? - [Iago snickers] - It's not funny! It's not funny, I swear! Stop laughing! Do you have any idea how hard it is for me? Forgive me. My sincerest apologies. I’m sorry, okay? I just thought it was funny and cute, that's all. You even brought... ...an Italian phrasebook with you. But that's great. You’re good. Seriously. Not many others would do that. Whatever. But you needed that. Just treat this as real-world practice. It's tough making a living here. Especially if you can’t speak Italian. Here in Italy, whether you are flat-nosed, as you pointed out awhile ago, or chinky-eyed, doesn't matter. If you speak Italian, you're on equal footing with everyone else. Hah! There's my lesson for the day. You weren't bad at all. So, how did you learn to speak Filipino? I was born here. My parents are both Filipinos. Some of my relatives from Batangas live here, too. So there. Peace? I’m Iago, by the way. I’m Malaya. Malaya...to be free! You are free. Malaya is freedom. Malaya. [engine rumbles] What the heck are you doing?! - [engine rumbles] - You'll get us in trouble! - [engine rumbles] - Trust me. Don’t do this, Iago! - Is this your first job? - Yeah. So don't jinx it. Let’s do our best. Don’t worry. I got your back. No, thanks. - I don’t want trouble. - They won’t even know. So this is what rich folks do on a sunset cruise. I don't want to work as a nanny. I graduated from college to have better options. But when I got here... ...I realized my skills are useless. Just believe in yourself. Be street-smart. Honestly, you’re doing just fine. Don’t get me wrong, okay? I have nothing against being a domestic helper. My mom is one, after all. Some of my aunts and cousins are, too. They worked hard, and saved up for their own houses. They practically have a little Italy in Batangas. It's so beautiful out here! Beautiful. [huffs] Have a drink. [music plays] [phone rings] [phone rings] [phone rings] [groans] [phone rings] Hello, love? - [Where are you?] - I'm still at work. - I've been trying-- - Talk to you later, love. Bye. Thank you. Thank you very much for everything. [giggles] You're thanking me as if this is last time we'll be seeing each other. I don’t know about you, but I still want to see you again. Sorry? I don't understand. Look it up. Seriously. Get some rest. Thanks for today. Thank you, too. - Grandma is here! - Hello! - [How are you, dear?] - [We missed you, grandma!] - I missed you too, dear! - We missed you, too! I missed you so much, grandma! My love! Hello, grandma! Mom. Mom! Come on, phone's ringing. Give me a minute, okay? I'm in the middle of a game. Mom! I heard your sister, Laya, quit her job as a nanny. She can't afford to be picky with work here. She said it was too exhausting looking after kids. More than that, she has a Communication degree, but she ended up being a nanny. She really wants to work in media. We got a winner! Oh, that's great news. She’ll be there at 8:00 AM tomorrow. Yes, at the port. Thank you. Signora's really impressed with you. Which is why she wants you there again tomorrow. 8:00 AM sharp. You can bring the person who helped you out last time. She really likes you. Now, the next three months will be crucial. Just pray that it turns out well so that she takes you in for good. Who knows, she might even promote you as Executive Assistant. That's great news, Laya! Who knows, you might get to hang out with the producer's relatives. You never know, right? Can you give me the phone? - This one? - Yes. Oh, come on! I need to text Santiago, okay? Come on! Alright. You're meeting up with that guy again? It’s not what you think. - Shut up, Maki. - Good for you, Laya! Laya got a new job? Mira, you should have recommended Laya to Signora Nicola. That way, you'll be working in the same place. It’s your chance to catch up with each other. It's been 20 years, yes. Our children are so lucky. We all strived to build the good reputation of Filipino domestic workers here in Italy. And I think we've succeeded in building our reputation as a hardworking and trustworthy people. That's true. I remember we arrived here in Italy in March of 1996. I started working from that time. We had no idea what kind of employers we'd be getting. Now, your mom here had to hide in the trunk of a car for seven days. - Remember?! - The trunk? Yeah. So she can cross the border safely. You didn't tell her about this? I loaned 150,000 pesos just to pay off the driver so I can cross the border. Mom, why did it take you that long to cross the border? We had to get across the border at night to avoid getting caught. Luckily, they granted amnesty to migrants in 1999. Eventually... I was able to get both of you here in Italy. If you only knew how hard we had to work just to be able to send enough money to the Philippines. The kids who got left behind... ...had their own share of sacrifices, too. [music plays] [winces] Good morning. Good morning. I brought you something. I know this is bad for you. But whatever makes you sane, I guess. Thanks. Thanks for cutting my life short. Here. That’s yours. I bought this for you. Did you know that this is one of my favorites? Perfect. Do you know what this is in Italian? No. - Huh? - Let me see... [mimics Italian accent] Po-me-gra-Na-Te? [mimics Italian accent] Po-me-gra-Na-Te. It’s so good! I miss you. What does that mean? Look it up. Just wait until I get better at this. You look so messy already. Sorry. You look like a monkey. God, you’re so mean! How long did it take for you to learn Italian? - Pretty quickly. - Shut up. No, it's because I was born here. What did you take up in college? I didn't finish college. I had to drop out of school. Why? Obviously, I had no money. That, and my dad and I didn't get along. I had too much pride. So I ran away. Now, I’m still saving up. Iago. Give it to me. Oh, it’s wet! I’ll just put these here. Do you need to wash your hands? - Cheers! - Cheers! [groans] Was there a woman who came here to see me? Huh? I said, was there a woman who came here to see me? Because I heard a voice. She was whispering in my ear. She said... “I love you.” There’s no one else around. Except me. You look like my cousin. I had a crush on her. We’d better go. Here. Come on. Take it. Thanks a lot. I could really use extra money. [cash register pinging] So where do you live? At your girlfriend's place? No. I'm staying over at my friend's place. They basically adopted me. They’re really nice. Who was calling earlier? Was that your girlfriend? Are you spying on me? Is she an I? Yeah. What about you? Do I have a girlfriend? No. I have a boyfriend. An ex-boyfriend, that is. We broke up just recently. You know, I had a friend once who bullied my cousin who just arrived here. He called him Chinese. He was curious about foreigners. He wondered why they didn't speak Italian. So I told him off. I said, “You stay away from my cousin, you punk!" “You mess with him, you have to deal with me.” [scoffs] That scared him off. I never had anyone like that. Someone to protect me. All my life, I got used to just fending for myself. You're pretty cool. [phone rings] [phone rings] [phone rings] She's probably worried about you now. The alarm went off. I have a job interview. [proudly] As a Sous chef. You know how to cook? Of course not! You’re crazy. Fake it... - ...until you make it. - [Laya groans] You need to go. You'll have to be there early. Good luck. I know you can do it. Of course. See you. Malaya. Here. Thank you. See you. "Guinti Marzocco Dictionary" [camera shutter clicks] - Miss. - [Laya gasps] You dumped me three years ago. Oh, my god. - Santiago. - Iago. Exactly. I didn’t do that. How can I dump you when you already had a girlfriend? And you just vanished into thin air... ...like bubbles. Bubble. Like a bubble. Just one. Single. You weren’t even single then. Okay. You got me. - Ouch. - But it’s true, though. You had a girlfriend then. Listen. Do you know what I wanted then? I wanted to meet a Filipina... Who's as beautiful... And as smart... As you are. Nice. Nice one, bubble boy. Look at you now! Still as beautiful as last time. I’ve been watching you for a while back on that train. The dictionary's a big help, right? How are ya, banana?! Idiot. Hey. Maybe... ...you could include this for your #100happydays post? I've seen your posts. “Make every moment count.” "Good vibes." Hey, hold on. Aren’t you happy to see me? Because I am. When I saw you again... ...I realized I actually missed you. Laying it on thick with the flattery. Nice going, Bubbles. No, it's Bubble. Alright then. What’s my name? Malaya. Why the heck are you even asking that? Just checking. Okay. Okay, what’s my number? 327-782-0258. Wow! Impressive memory. Too bad it's wasted on you. Is this still your number? The last three digits are 327. - That's why. - [phone rings] [phone rings] That’s my number. Keep it. Okay, smooth operator. Why don't you... ...post this meeting for your #100happydays posts? Come on. [camera shutter clicks] - You're really something. - Am I? Not really. I live over there. - Up there? - Yeah. You want to drop by? I’ll introduce you to my Mom. [snickers] How about tomorrow? Is that okay? Or maybe some other time. - Tomorrow? - Yeah. Why? Are you picking me up tomorrow? Yes! My restaurant shift starts in an hour. I'll be getting off by 11:30 PM. - Okay, Bubbles. - Come on. Tomorrow. I'll be here, promise. Sure. - Iago. - Yeah? - Thank you. - Goodnight. [music plays] [doorbell rings] Laya, is that you? Yes, Signora. My favorite gardener is here now. Offer him some coffee later. A little reward for all his splendid work. Come here, kitty. [cat meows] [cat meows] [cat meows] There you go. Good morning. Good morning. Hey! What are you doing here? How...? I'm here to visit you. Seriously? My family lives around these parts. I sort of grew up here. I used to do errands for Signora Anna as a kid. She's up early, so I had to be here early. Guess what. I just made her day. How about you? Did you get any sleep? A bit. I went straight to my mom’s place last night. - You don't look happy. - It's not that! [laughter] [phone pings] Malaya. I'll be back later, okay? Alright. Why don’t you sleep here anymore, Iago? You weren't even here for my birthday. I slept here last night. Don't worry, I'll sleep in our room next time. We missed you so much, Santiago. [huffs] I have something for you. [teasing happily] [giggles] What about me? No money for me? You guys can share it. Ma. Here. Why don't you hand it over to your dad? Well, here you are. Looks like you’re earning a lot. Just enough. Now you know how hard it is to earn money. Just to put food on the table. I’m saving up and working hard so that I can-- What? Get rich? Yeah. So that I'd never worry about money again. How? Knowing you? I’ll save up. I can do it. That's why I'm working hard. Iago. You’re just a lowly worker. And you will always be for the rest of your life just like the rest of us! I’m not some lowly worker. Right now, yes. But I will rise above this someday. I will become my own boss. You think so highly of yourself, don’t you? I worked hard for that! Oh, you're full of it! You're not getting anywhere in life! Fuck it! Iago. This is my favorite spot. Because I can see everything from here. How many Filipinos even live here in Matera? Just me and my family, I think. This place is far from downtown. I wonder what's going on in that house. You know, I’m actually glad... ...that my boyfriend and I split up. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't have even entertained the thought of getting here. Of reuniting with my mom and Maki. I wouldn't be here... ...if I didn't end things with him. Why the long face? I was born with it. What are you looking at, anyway? I'll show you. Come on. Take those sunglasses off, okay? There. Now, look. Do you see what I see? Someone’s taking a shower. Is that what you’re looking at? - Someone’s taking a shower? - Yeah. Look over there. - Where? - Over there. Can you see the couple? [snickers] Oh yeah, you’re right. "You're scrubbing too hard!" [giggles] Are you over him? Yeah. A long time ago. What about you? Are you over her? Yeah. It wasn't so hard. She's nothing compared to you, a true-blue classic Filipina. Nice one, Bubbles. Real smooth. We better head out. It's a long way ahead. You’re right. We still have a long way to go. Let’s see where it goes. It’s so beautiful here, Iago! This reminds me so much of home. Want to go back to the Philippines with me? Sure. I think it's nice to be back home. [song plays] It's nice to have you around. This is my first time taking a girl here. Usually, I come here alone. Why? No reason. Maybe it's because... ...I didn't think someone else would appreciate this. Walking an unfamiliar path. I think a person who loves nature is special. Even possibly a keeper. A protector of Mother Earth. Someone who recognizes that the earth is our home, and that we should preserve it for future generations. Let’s go. Hello, everyone! Malaya, meet my family. Everyone, this is Laya. It’s great to meet you, Malaya. Hi! Pleasure to meet all of you! How are you, Santiago? You brought a friend along. This is Laya. I’m Donato, nice to meet you! This is one of my favorites. He doesn’t charge me for anything. - Seriously? Lucky you. - That’s why I'm always here. - Thank you. - Anytime! - Thank you. - Anytime, Santiago. This is so good! See that? That building with the signage over there. That’s where they make my favorite beer. Don't point at things! Do you see it? Stop pointing at things! Bite your finger, quick! - You do it. - No, you should do it! Go on. That one, the finger you pointed with. - This one? - Yeah, that one. I'm like an olive tree. Because I have a strong will to live. We can live anywhere. In cold or hot season. Even in the desert. We will still thrive and grow. Malaya, please do the bank deposits today. Once you're done, please hand this over to my accountant. - Yes, Signora. - Thanks! Cheers! Someday... I want to prove my dad wrong. I want to prove to him that I can be my own boss. Anything's possible. We Filipinos are known for our strength of character, right? My old man? Not so much. For some reason, he didn't rise above his circumstances. Wouldn't that be hard, since you didn't finish school? I will, someday. I believe... ...that we all need is to trust ourselves. That, and we have to have courage. Bubbles... I'm scheduled for a job interview. I applied as a sales assistant... ...to that leather shop I've dreamed of working in. Will you come with me? - You don't have to ask. - Really? That's great, Laya. Cheers to new beginnings. - Thank you very much! - Welcome! Wow! That looks delicious. Try some. - It's good, right? - It is! It's really good. Malaya. Mom. Iago, this is my mom. Hello, Mom. Mom, this is Iago. Iago, this is my mom. Good evening, Ma’am. Santiago is the guy who helped me clean up the boat. Yes, that's right. How are you, ma'am? Why don't you go inside? - Oh, thanks. - He’s leaving in a bit. He just walked me home. Is he your boyfriend? No, he’s not. Good. It's better to put it off for the time being. You should focus on more important things. Like building a career, and helping me out. I know he likes you. But he won’t marry you. I don’t like him, honestly. He can hardly look me straight in the eye. Mom, he’s just probably shy. Malaya, life here in Italy is different. As foreigners, we need to work even harder. We have to adapt to everything here - speaking their language, knowing how to work a faucet. We have to learn to be like them. And you can't do that by starting a relationship this early in your life. Don't waste your chance to have a better life. Besides, there are plenty other men out there. You can choose... ...from so many men from so many places. But as far as money goes, you have to work very hard for it. Do you understand? Do you understand, Laya? Yes, Mom. If you're meant to be, then you're meant to be. You have to make sacrifices for the meantime. You have nothing to worry about, Mom. I'm here to earn a living. And to get our family back together again. Because I don't want us to be apart again. [frustrated] Where are you, Iago?! I don’t have any retail work experience... ...but I am a fast learner. [phone ringing] [groans] [phone ringing] Hello, Signore. Can you come early for work? Sure. Right now? Yes please, Santiago. - Alright. - Thanks. [phone ringing] The number you dialed cannot be reached. Please try again. The restaurant is still closed, miss. We're opening in 10 minutes. I’m looking for Santiago. Santiago? It’s his day off today. This way, come on. Yes, thank you. Thank you, Signore. Santiago lives there. That’s the door to his apartment. You stood me up. Laya. Are you hungry? Do you want to eat? Come on, let's eat. Come. Welcome. Here you go. Santiago chose the best dish for him and his lady. - Thank you. - Thank you, Simeone. This is Malaya. She's from the Philippines. Pleasure to meet you. Hello, beautiful. Is she your girlfriend? Well, then. Please. Enjoy your meal. Thank you. Go on. Eat. You did that on purpose, didn't you? No. It's not my fault he assumed things. I asked you for moral support. But you flaked on me. I’m really sorry about that. I’m sorry. Why were you not there? Let’s not talk about it. I asked you for a simple favor, Iago. All you have to do was accompany me, that's all. But you stood me up. Why did you do that? Do you know what I like about you, Iago? I like that I feel that I count on you anytime. That you got my back always. I know I can depend on you because you always find a way. But now, you can't find your way out of this. Did you get intimidated by my Mom? Malaya. You're putting me on the spot, okay? I can't always be there for you. I make mistakes, too. You can’t depend on me all the time. That's just how I am. I know you’re not perfect. But I know you don’t just leave people hanging. I know you're a good person, Iago. And I know you can be better. I'm really sorry, Laya. I'm sorry for giving you these expectations. Do you know... ...that feeling of wanting something so badly? Of wanting to achieve something but feeling that something's holding you back? Of feeling like... ...nothing you’d ever do will be enough. Of having so many questions... ...yet not being able to get any answers. That feeling of not being able to achieve anything - like being shackled to the ground. Do you know what that feels like? Iago, you’re not alone. We all have our struggles in life to deal with. Then don't be angry anymore, okay? Alright. I'll make it up to you, I promise. You’re so annoying. Did you like the pasta? It’s delicious. Hey, stop it. - Why? - Just stop it. - What? - Don't look at my feet! - Your feet? - Yes. Just stop it, okay? My ex once told me... ...that my feet look weird, like hands. Hey. Do they? Stop it. - Nice to meet you! - Cut it out! You're such a jerk. I know you're tired. You could really use a massage. [deep breath] A month after I ran away from home... ...I got myself a job. I had to work in order to survive. My employer... ...was this huge, tall guy. He treated me well. So it was all good. I did have a hunch that he wasn't straight. I felt that... ...he was attracted to me. He lets me sleep at the warehouse. I think it happened twice. One time... ...I woke up and my zip was fully undone. He was there. Watching me. I will never forget the way he looked at me. That fucking look on his face. I never told this to anyone... ...because I'm scared that people might judge me. I just tried to forget it. To put it at the back of my mind. My ex... ...kicked me in the head. I don’t remember... ...why, or how. Or what happened. But that feeling, that trauma, stayed with me. And then... ...he grabbed my neck. He choked me... ...until I felt the air being cut off from me. Literally. I was wide-awake... ...but I just couldn’t breathe. I looked at him... I looked in his eyes. And I saw anger. I saw hatred. It's like I wasn't there gasping for life. He was raging. Was he angry at me, at life itself? I don’t know. Is that what blacking out from anger feels like? As I gasped for air, for dear life, I thought to myself I can’t die this way. [exhales] Do or die. I don't even know... ...how I snapped out of it. Did I shove him? I don’t remember anymore. All I can recall is... The moment... ...I started breathing in again. After that, he kept saying sorry to me. From that moment on, I knew it was all over. I’ve never told anyone about this, either. I felt that nobody else would understand what I went through. Until I met you. Come on. I'll show you something. You're into film, right? I'm sure you'll love this. It’s a bit... ...risqué, but that's what art is. So there. [moaning] That means he wanted to have sex with you. Well, did you? Of course not. It’s my first time to watch an R-rated film with a guy who's not my boyfriend. You know I'm not comfortable watching that, right? I don’t want him to think that I'm as promiscuous as the women he's seen onscreen. I'm a guy, and I know he's sending out feelers to you. That’s his subtle message. I'm not the super-liberated type, okay? I can be liberal-minded but I don’t make the first move. I don’t even know if he really likes me. He likes you. That's his way of showing it. What other proof do you need? The thing is, is he serious about me? He should walk the walk and talk the talk. You need to keep your expectations down a bit, Laya. Reality check, okay? For all you know, he might already have a kid. Or a girlfriend, who knows. Are you sure he's not in a relationship? No, he doesn’t have a girlfriend. I'm a guy, Laya. So I know exactly how his mind works. I just don’t want you to get the short end of the stick. You know what Mom would think of this, right? - Sacrifice and all. - Okay. Just put that off for now. Would you rather choose your career, or love? [phone ringing] Maki, can you take this call for me? I’m not ready to talk to him right now. Hello. One moment, please. It's from the leather shop. Hello. Yes. I see. That's great news. Thank you. - [shrieks] I got in! - Congratulations, Laya! Iago? I’m quitting my job. I want to be free. I want to save up. I want to explore, go places. I want a fresh start. I applied for work at an olive farm. An olive picker, to be exact. I’ll be staying there for three months. Free food and lodging. No deductions. I get to take home my entire earnings. I ran the numbers. Turns out I can save 10,000 euros from that stint. I want to fly! [voice echoing] Come with me, Laya. Just the two of us. Together. You want to be with me? You and no one else. I got a job in the leather shop. I'm starting work the day after tomorrow. I can't leave Mom. [huffs] Iago. I can't leave her, not after all those years of being away from her. She wasn't there... ...for a good part of my life. This is my chance to make up for all the times we've been apart. Are you sure about your decision? I am now. Mama doesn’t approve, either. But I have nothing to lose, right? This is my life, after all. [inhales sharply] If it doesn't work out, then I'll have to deal with it. Iago. Can we... Can we sort out our lives first? For now, I need to focus on my career. We may have to live apart for the time being. But it'll work out for you. I know it will. Things are pretty clear-cut with you. But that's not how it is for me. [huffs] [exhales sharply] [song plays] We'll miss you, Santiago! Thank you. Good luck, Iago. Goodbye, Santiago. We'll see each other again. Put an even coat on, okay? Good morning! - Good morning. - Good morning. Your earrings are gorgeous. Can I see it? It’s made in the Philippines. How much is it? It’s 10 euros. I have another pair for sale, but I can give it yo you for five euros. I’ll buy it. Thanks! [tree shaker buzzing] [engine rumbling] Hello. I'm Santiago. I’m Celeste. [tree shaker buzzing] Mom, look what I got you. - Try it on. - Wow. It’s beautiful. It looks good on you. You are so beautiful, my love. Thank you, my love. [song playing] I'm sorry. [puffs cigarette] She's the daughter of the farm owner. I don’t want to know the details. [exhales sharply] Malaya, you know I don’t keep anything from you. I tell you everything as much as I can. Iago. Can we make this night about us? Do you hate me? I should, but I can't. [song playing] [shower running] I love you. - Have you heard? - What?? Daniela's boyfriend left her. He broke up with her and married another girl. Poor, sweet Daniela. But love can be unpredictable sometimes. I hope she finds a better man. Is there anything wrong, Malaya? Malaya? Hey. - [whistles] - Yeah? Are you feeling alright? - I’m okay. - What’s wrong? Are you feeling alright? Yes. Thanks. We’re closing, you can go ahead. Good night. Good evening. This is my father, Rolan. And my mother, Ging. And these are my relatives. Welcome to our home. Here’s our bride-to-be, Celeste. Malaya, you’re here! Come help me make some orecchiette. Malaya. What’s wrong? What happened to you? Don’t you ever trust men. Understood? To Santiago and Celeste, we wish for your union to be fruitful and prosperous. To Rolan and Ging, welcome to our family. Cheers to Santiago and Celeste! - Cheers! - Cheers! Cheers! I'm so happy right now. You’re beautiful, Celeste. And you are handsome. Malaya, are you there? Why are you sitting in the dark? Why did you leave me then? What’s going on? Nothing. I just want to know. You brought Maki to Italy when he was only seven. What took you so long to petition me? I didn't want you to end up as a domestic helper. I wanted you to graduate from college so that you'd have options in life. I took Maki at an early age because younger kids adapt more easily. I left you behind because I didn't want you to leave everything and start over. I resented you for that, Mom. Because for the longest time, I was on my own. Nobody helped me with my school projects. I had no one with me on Parents' Day. I had nobody to comfort me when I need it most. Did you know... ...that Grandma was the one who bought my first sanitary napkin? Unlike grandma, you were never there for me for all those important moments in my life. I found it hard to accept the fact that you left your daughter behind... All while you were out in a foreign land taking care of the children of strangers... Putting them to sleep at night... While I lied in bed alone... ...crying myself to sleep. I know you left in order to give us a better life. You're really lucky, you know? Because I didn't end up rebelling against you like other OFW kids. Please don't say these things, Malaya. You don’t know the sacrifices I made for our family. I had a very difficult time earning money, making ends meet, saving up. But I endured all that because I wanted a better life for you and Maki. Mom, I've done everything you wanted all this time, right? I gave everything I can, sacrificed everything I can, for this family. Love is so much more than providing for us, Mom. It's about being there for someone. And you weren't. Not for me. I’m sorry. - But you have to make sacri-- - Make sacrifices?! Mom, I've been through this since I was two years old. How much longer am I supposed to do this?! Can I even choose myself for once? Just this once, Mom? I’m moving out. Hello, guys and gals! This is the Origami bag. You can see the intricate beadwork. We're getting lots of inquiries, Laya. You're quite the salesperson. Maki, do you think there's a market for olive oil in the Philippines? I have no idea. Why? Okay. Let’s keep this between us for now. It still a long process to go through. Okay. I put up a bid to be a distributor in one of the country’s major olive plantations. Really? So... If they say yes, then... ...I can secure a distribution deal with them. That sounds great. I want to export olive oil to the Philippines. But of course you can do it. We'll make money from this. That way, you can save enough for your wedding. Are you crazy? I don't even have a boyfriend yet. Unless you want to be an old cat lady, that is. You think I'd end up being an old cat lady? I know you've got a number of suitors. But you don't seem to like any one of them. They don’t have what I’m looking for in a man. Laya. Don’t tell me you’re still wishing to get back with Santiago? Wait, what did you call him again? Bully? It’s Bubbles. Because he pops in and out so quickly. Gotcha! You're not over him at all. Do you love him? Too much. Then why didn't you fight to keep him? Are you serious, Maki? Of course I did. I fought hard to keep him. That's why I gave myself up for him. But it wasn't enough. That's just how it is, I guess. I can't resent him for that. I think we should try having a baby. Maybe he was looking for security more than anything. And I chose to be with Mom. Maybe he didn't know me well enough. Otherwise... If he really did... He would know... ...that I gave up every single thing for him. No one else. Just for him. He should know that. But Laya... ...what if he really loves her? Santiago and I argue over so many things. I don't think so. I just know it. But maybe I just have to accept it. That's life, right? Wait 'til he sees you right now, Laya! I'm sure he'll regret leaving such a beautiful woman like you. Hey, I don't go for married men, okay? What if... ...he ends up divorcing her? Would you take him back? Maki, that’s a whole new different story. [phone ringing] Hello. Malaya. Hey. What’s up? Where are you now? Uh... I'm having breakfast right now. Can we meet up? Today? At 2:00 PM. Hmmm... Okay, sure. Meet me at the Trani Church. Okay. Bye. Laya, where are you now? I’m on my way. [phone ringing] [phone ringing] I’m here now. I just found a parking slot. I waited for a long time. So I left already. Wait. I had to drive around the parking lot three times just to find a spot. Just tell me where you are right now, okay?! I told you, I already left. Oh, for fuck's sake, Iago! Did I just go all the way here for nothing?! You made me rush here to meet you and you couldn’t even wait for me?! Where the hell Ar--?! You know what? Fuck you! You keep doing this to me. Fuck you! [bird caws] [groans] Iago, you fucking idiot! [cries furiously] [exhales sharply] Fuck it. I fall for it every time. I'm such a fucking idiot! Fuck! Fuck you, Santiago. Fuck you for putting me through this! Fucking asshole. [song plays] - Malaya. - Fuck you! Why?! Why?! Why do you keep doing this to me?! Malaya, I’m sorry. I don't want to hear it! Malaya, calm down. I saved myself for you. I was hoping that you'd choose me in the end! But you didn’t! Now you tell me why! [panting] [sobbing] - Malaya, I was wrong. - Shut up! She's too scared of things. She's not good for me. She doesn't care about me. Malaya. You get your fucking hands off me! You left me to be with her! And yet you still screwed it up?! You just wasted all the sacrifices I made for you! You think it was easy for me?! Then why the hell did you choose to fucking leave me?! I did what I thought was right. I chose not to hurt everyone else! Oh, did you?! I chose for the sake of my family! That was what I did. Is that why you chose to hurt me?! You and me. I can't believe you're putting me through this again! We always end up like this. And now you’re leaving me again. You better fix your marriage. You chose a simpler life. So you better make things work. [song plays] We are honored to export our product to the Philippines. But you'll have to speak with my brother-in-law. Sorry that he's a bit late. Just as well, we can talk for a bit more. He accompanied his wife to the doctor's. They’re having their first baby. That's why he’s a bit late. Oh, here he is. Hello, Luca. Santiago. This is Malaya. Did you know about this? Excuse us, Luca. I only learned about it at the Board meeting. I was really surprised to see your name. You had a solid business plan. I'm so happy for you. - I don’t feel the same way. - Hey. I did exactly what you told me. We both got what we wanted. Celeste's having a baby, and you're... Getting the distribution deal. Our paths keep crossing. But things just never seem to work out. This is a huge project, Malaya. You deserve this. Let me help you this time. Just like how you supported me back then. Please let me do this for you. You really are good at this. You're a natural. Do you think I'll succeed? There’s nothing in this world that you can't do. All you have to do is believe in yourself. I will always support you until you finally reach your goals. Alright, sure. Yes. Our dreams are finally coming true. Malaya... ...did you ever think we'd meet again? You know the answer to that. I really hope things work out. Just hope for the best. If it doesn’t work out, let’s proceed with plan B. See? You're really cut out for this. How did you learn the ropes? Well, it wasn't too hard. Good old Iago. Humble as ever. You haven't changed at all. I told you I'd finish my studies, right? So I studied hard. But getting a diploma is not the answer to everything. Money's great, sure. But it won't make you happy. It’s not working out. The numbers look pretty good. We're just too different. Since when did you start smoking? Give it back. I said, give it back I asked you a question. Months, years, I don't know. What the heck, Iago? You're a wet smoker? [snickers loudly] Hey! It's not funny! Wow. Stop it already. It was because of the tea. My stomach was queasy. Excuses, excuses. Karma's a bitch, huh? You’re so annoying. Do you still have the bottle? Remember this? How can I forget? To this day, I'm still wondering how that ended up in my bag. If you didn't put it in there... ...then I probably did. Oh, of course you did! No wonder there were ants setting up a colony in my bag! I accidentally left mine inside the backpack once. That kept me company for three long months. It reminded me of your #100happydays posts. It gave me comfort... ...throughout my stay at the farm. - Hey, Malaya. - Hi, Luca. I brought the documents I discussed with you this morning. Here. Here you can see the income and the production data. The machines that we use are relatively new. I hope this helps. Iago, where you going? Celeste called. I have to go. I actually don’t have the documents, Miss Malaya. But Signor Iago did ask me to assist you. I’m sorry I can't help with much else. It's alright. May I ask why he's not here? I’m sorry, Miss Malaya. I have no idea. I had to stay with Celeste today, Laya. Are you her nanny? We are going through something major right now. [keys clacking] Sorry for telling you this. Honestly... ...your wife is beginning to piss me off. She doesn’t want you to shine. Iago... ...you have such a great mind for business. And what does she do? Instead of supporting you, she just wants to cling to you. Instead of letting you explore your talents. It's such a waste. She's really selfish. Malaya, I can’t do this with you anymore. Iago, this is by far the most important project I've been involved in all my life. You said... ...you wanted to make up for everything. Iago... I don’t know anything about the olive industry. I don’t know anything about exporting goods. I had the confidence to take on this because you said you will help me through this, and that we will do this together. Now, you’re quitting on me in the middle of the deal. This is a very promising project, Laya. And it's all thanks to your solid business plan. I know it's going to be a success. You can do it. I believe in you. Luca will help you along the way. The permits have not yet been approved. Okay. Let’s work out something, then. [in tears] Mom. Mom. Malaya, what’s wrong? It’s alright. I love him, Mom. I can't lie to myself anymore. You're right, there are many other men out there. But he's the only man I want. It's hard to find someone like him. A man who connects with you on so many levels. Someone who makes you feel complete. Why can’t I just find it with another man? I thought I'd find someone else, but I just can't. Am I wrong, Mom? Am I wrong for not wanting to let him go? You said... ...if it's meant to be, then it's meant to be. I’m hoping that things will finally work out for Iago and me. But it's as though I'm waiting for nothing. Laya... ...maybe fate sent him to you for some other reason. Sometimes, in life... We cross paths with people... ...who would teach us more about ourselves. They're there to help us find our inner strength. Or to teach us the true meaning of love. Just surrender to it all, Laya. Just let things happen. And make sure you find your inner strength through it all. Be strong, Laya. Malaya. I love you. I love you with all my life. I know you do, Mom. I’m really sorry. I tried my best, Dad. Dad. Please forgive me, Iago. For everything I've done. Thank you Santiago, for agreeing to Celeste's request to be by her side until the baby is born. Santiago, thank you for this. We can still be friends, Celeste. And I will always be the father of our child. Thank you. Congratulations, Laya. - Thank you, Mom. - I’m so proud of you. Cheers to Malaya’s distribution deal! One, two, three, smile! [camera shutter clicks] Thank you for agreeing to meet me, Santiago. See you later. What’s this? That’s you share. You worked hard on the project even if you didn’t finish it. Coffee. - Thank you. - You’re welcome. Can you stay a little longer for coffee? [water flowing] I won't take you away from your wife. She needs your reassurance on that. If we can’t be life partners... ...can we be professional partners at least? I don’t want to lose you again. We have gone through so much through the years... And it's clear to me now... ...that I will never find another man like you. Just like you will never find another woman like me. I know. [huffs] I can say these things now... ...because I know it’s over. When you left me... I didn't think I'd be able to move on. I was too stubborn and stupid... ...to accept the situation. But I had to learn to be stronger. If only being alone wasn't so hard. [song plays] I need you. Malaya. I feel like my heart's being torn apart. Because I want you to be a part of my life. Not just because you need me... ...but because you love me. I love you. [phone buzzing] [phone buzzing] - She's probably calling. - [phone buzzing] [phone buzzing] [phone buzzing] Laya... Let's stay this way. Us being this open to each other. Malaya, I have just one last thing to take care of. My beloved Malaya, You’re the first and last Filipina who left a mark in my life. You changed my outlook on life. With you, I realized what it's like to be loved. Forgive me for being too scared to take that leap with you. For doubting myself. As the years passed... ...I realized all the more that you're the only woman I want to be with. I was wrong for choosing to leave you. And I will keep on asking for your forgiveness until fate finally brings us back together. You made me feel that I can do anything. You believed that I can be a better man. And now, I'm ready to take that leap with you, Laya. You and I. Together. There's no stopping us this time. Santiago Don't worry, Miss. You're not traveling alone. [song plays]
