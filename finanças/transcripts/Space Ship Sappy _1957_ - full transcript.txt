If it ain't asking too much, where are we going? To the moon. STOOGES: Oh-- To the moon! But first we go to the planet of Sunev. Sunev? I never heard of it. It is a secret. That's "Venus" spelled backwards. But don't you tell somebody. Hey, we'll all be killed. Killed? I-I don't wanna die. I-I can't die. I haven't seen The Eddy Duchin Story yet and I-- We're traveling smoothly. Ah, the anticipation. Oh, I think so that we're approaching Sunev. Wait until you see Sunev. It is the most beautiful in my live I have n-- This is the most-- I wonder what it looks like. So do we. Come on. I don't see Sunev-- Look! There's a big funny looking bird and he's laying eggs all over the sky. Dozens of them. Boy, I hope they're scrambled. Eggs all over the sky. Get away and let me see. There, was I right? Yeah. [SPUTTERS] Ah. Stand by for landing. Descending normally. Engine. Ten, eight, six, four, two. [CRASHING] We are on Sunev. We've landed on Sunev. And the sooner we leave, the better we'll like it. Father. Yes. Father, the air test gauge shows the air outside to be the same as on Earth. Oh, smog. Good, then we will not need space helmets. Pardon me, please, gentlemen, I want you to go out and explore this planet and see what you can find. But pay strict attention to flora and fauna. Oh, boy, dames. Girls. Let's go. I never thought someone long I lived to be would be-- [BIRDS CHIRPING] [ANIMALS GRUNTING] Ay-ay-ay. Ay-ay-ay. Viva, viva. Viva, viva. Yum. Viva, yummy. Ay-ay-ay. Oh, father, father. What? This planet is inhabited by cannibalistic Amazons. Look, their cooking pot. What's cooking? Let's explore this place very carefully. Yeah, and keep an eye open for flora and fauna. Yeah, I'll keep 'em both open. Hey, this joint looks deserted. In fact, I think it's uninhabited. Yeah, and there's nobody lives here either. Yeah, what a wonderful place for a honeymoon. Ah, where would you get coffee? [BOTH GASP] Hey, there's flora, fauna and another one. Boy, they're tall ones. Hi, girls. Hi. Ay-ay-ay. Viva. Ay-ay-ay. Viva. Ay-ay-ay. Ay-ay-ay.

Now, hear this: RIMPLE [ON PA]: Those women are wild. They are vampires. Be careful. For they will love you to death. Love you to death? What a wonderful way to die. You know, my Uncle Peter died that way? Took the undertaker two days to wipe the smile off his face. No. Yes. Ah, that professor's silly. This innocent kids wouldn't hurt a fly. They're sweet as babies. [STOOGES GAGGING] [STOOGES LAUGHING] Father. Yeah? Father, look, those girls, they're tickling them to death.
