Could you open the wine once you're done? The guests are about to arrive. What? Can't you open it? No, maybe I'll be able to do it once we get a normal bottle opener. The one we have is perfectly fine. You just don't know how to use it. Wait... Wait... I can do it! What are you up to, Boki? Come to dinner. My folks think Stefan and I are getting married. Bring her too, there's enough food for the army of bulimics. Come, please, it'll be much easier for me. That's not really smart, you know. You're going to set yourself on fire one day. Better that having Milosh to find out. Sasha, we are waiting for you. The table is wobbly again. Then you'll fix it again. Stefan, after dinner I will show you my workshop. I'm afraid he won't be able to fit in it. The table or Stefan? You know, Stefan, Milosh turned a tiny storeroom into a workshop. - In that case, you'll have to do it without me. - Why? I'm claustrophobic. Do you mind if I smoke? No, thank you. In 9 days it'll be 10 years since I quit. Claustrophobic? Is that hereditary or some childhood trauma? My great great grandmother fell into a well when she was a kid. That's where she met my granddad. I mean, while he was pulling her out. I don't know if that's it, but since then the entire family has been suffering from claustrophobia. Have you graduated, Stefan? College is for the inept. What's new in the exciting world of water polo? Why must we always have these stupid conversations? Maybe because we want to get to know your future husband. And who said we are getting married? I've got a new job. Well paid. That's what we wanted to tell you. Stefan was offered a coaching job. He got a one-year contract and a salary. We decided to leave as soon as we get our visas. What visas? Canadian. And college? You are the one finishing it for me anyway. Don't you think this all a bit sudden? What'd you want? For me to stay until I'm 50? Tomorrow I'm moving in with Stefan. Can you at least be a little happy for me? Hey... I'm Lana, Stefan's sister. I've travelled back as soon as I heard what happened. How is Stefan? Sasha, when I saw an empty bed... How are you? I'm fine. Do you have a vase for these flowers? - I hate hospitals. I want to go home. - I know. Nobody likes hospitals. And you? I mean, you work here. You'll have to ask the doctor. In the name of people, the High Council of the Belgrade County Court the accused, Vladimir Savic, guilty of rape, a felony under article 103 paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law of Serbia, is sentenced to a maximum of 10 years in prison. The accused not only committed the act of rape, but he has not once shown remorse for his actions which is a very worrisome fact. Mr. Savic, I wish I could say that with this verdict justice prevailed, but... You are going to serve a sentence, but your victim will have to live her entire life with the stigma and the trauma. Think about that. You will have plenty of time. I thought it'd be the usual: 2, maximum 3 years, but 10? Maybe one day I'll be that cool. The car is polished to perfection. How much do I owe you? Nothing. A friend owns the shop. You have friends in all the right places. Countrymen. We stick together. Are you coming to play tennis tonight? Family obligations... You've had more luck than brains. Stefan's car, you should've seen that. Like a squished soda can. Am I boring you with this? Yes. Honey... I'm sorry for Stefan. But maybe that's a sign. In life you can't force anything. Fuck, it took him 2 hours to stick this on me. What's up? Bojan has applied for the post-grad on Bogona. Bocona. But they haven't replied. If they are crazy to turn you down, you don't need them. That's what I say. Ines, make us some coffee. Please. Watch the dress. The way she behaves... But I have to take it... Why are you so pale? Stefan is still in the hospital. And Milosh has again decorated my room. Terrible. The most important thing is to resolve things in here. Now, kid, take your pants off, it's party time. Is it going to hurt? No. See? You didn't feel a thing. Who's that? A banana and some girl. Hey, I got a hard-on this morning. I wanted to drink something to celebrate, but the doctor wouldn't let me. Wait a minute, has he told you anything? He doesn't know if I'll be able to walk again. I'm just kidding... Hey, Sacha, can you do me a favor? Knock, knock! Hello! - What are you doing this early? - I'm just going to... Yeah, really early... You were always hot for brunettes. I brought you my kids to look at. Don't be too critical or I'll bite. Oh, well... Good. All the way... Good. I'm missing something green. Yes, a palm tree. Look, I'm not planning to stay here my entire life. Just try to enjoy the colors. Hey, Lana, what's new in Paris? Bad phase? You'd be mad if I hadn't come. Whatever I do is not good. I know, I know. Some shit happened and you had to split. I'll bring some Propolis syrup. It'd good for the immunity. What's the age difference between Stefan and you? Too big. I was adopted, you know. Really? I'm just kidding. I've never felt as if I belonged to that family. My father is an orphan. Really? He's happy that he's got us, that he succeeded in life. - At least that's what he thinks. - And you? I don't know. I feel sorry for him. They are that crazy generation, born at the worst time. And we? At least we have the Internet. I know a great raft. Can I buy you a coffee? Hey, we are in no rush. Don't worry. I'm a better driver than Stefan. When it beats like this I know I'm alive. You can all go screw yourselves. Sasha, what's wrong with you? I didn't mean to... Sacha?! Stef, your sister is an idiot. Wait, I've got another call. Hello? Just a second... Why didn't you tell me? Wait, I just need to say bye to Bojan. Boki, can we talk later? Wait then... Stef... My mother has a lover. All of a sudden he fell like a fly. Sorry, I didn't even introduce myself. Zoran. Sasha. I work with your father. He probably mentioned me. He didn't. Are you sure you don't want some coffee? No, thank you. Some other time. Please, if you need anything, I'm here for you. Call me. Everything will be OK. Your father is an extraordinary man. Where is Zoran? He left. Please hand me my pills from the bag. Give me one. It hit me right here. As a knife. I can see everything in your eyes. I'm the same. I went to see the doctor. And? He found a murmur, nothing serious. Had I not fainted, I'd have never known what a great lemonade you can make. What else did they tell you? They don't have to tell me anything. I know it already. Exhaustion. But tell me, what do you think of Zoran? I don't know. Why? Great guy. Intelligent. Hard working... I'm sure he liked you. We have only met 5 minutes ago. It was like that with your mother and me. Love at first sight. Dad, Zoran is absolutely not my type, OK? Just so you know, all the girls at the court are interested in him. I can't believe this. Sasha... Why are you in bed? I didn't know Milosh was on medication. The more he takes it, the worse he feels. Do you have to smoke so much? Would you prefer if I shot heroin? What is that supposed to mean? Everybody has some something, some vice. But why am I telling you this, you already know that better than anybody. What are you talking about? Lila, I saw you two. I was at the river. Sasha... Things seem different when you are looking at them from outside. - Don't I have the right to feel alive? - Why do you keep lying to me? - Because you don't understand, Sasha. - And you understand me? Sasha, I'm waiting for you to notice me. Me! - For once listen to what I have to say. - I've changed my mind. I'm not interested. Your father and I haven't slept together for 20 years. Now what do we do? Hey, come on in. What's all this? I'm preparing an exhibit. I've been postponing it for 2 years. First the graduation, and now I have to find a space, sponsor... These days you also have to be your own manager. You could be Helmut Newton, but if you can't sell yourself it's for nothing. As an apology, can I invite you for lunch? My mother brought her lovers home. We had to get to know each of them. Horrible. She only stopped when she found one of them holding me in his lap showing me a new toy. I was 11. You are the first Stefan's girlfriend I can talk to. I have nothing against his exes, just that they weren't my type. Do you love him? Yes. How do you know? He's very attentive towards me. I like to spend time with him. He's your brother, Lana. So? I don't believe in passion. You don't seem like that. What do I seem like? Like somebody who wants to be seduced. What is this? Here, take the towel. I am... I am drunk. Zero points. You're cheating. You need to say something less obvious. I steal perfumes at parties. Come on, now say something you have never said out loud before. I hate my hair. Yes, it's a bit out of fashion. You need to work on it. And my feet. Why? Let me see. I'm sorry. I'm scared I'll never fall in love. I'm scared I'll never be able to have an orgasm. My folks are getting a divorce. Sasha! Miss, what... Drive! Go! Go now! Miss, are you free tonight? Everything has changed here. Sasha, do you know who Cvetkovic and Bozinovski are? They used to do portraits. Portraits of the guests. I still have one of myself, on a napkin. Lila, I really don't have much time. I don't have time. I've already lost too much of it. Hello? Yes, this is her. Milica? Sinisa Cvetanovic? Yes, all right. Serbian: B. Art: A. Music: A. Social Sciences: B, Math: A, PE... A. I will not give up that man for anything or anybody. I'm sorry, Judge. I thought you'd left. It's all right, Andja. How's your daughter? Ljilja is great. I have enrolled her in a hairdresser school. She should keep it up. I was a great student in school. But she smokes. She rolls some really hard cigarettes. Cannabis. You need to stop it immediately. Bring her here one day. I'll talk to her. I'll scare her a bit. Thank you, Judge. Come here. What do you think, for Ljilja? I don't know, she still doesn't have her driver's license. Not the car, Zoran. Ljilja prefers dark and tall men. But if he is good on the inside... Andja, would you come by some times, to clean up a little bit? Of course. Is this the handsomest patient in the city? You look different. I have found it in a bookstore. I've highlighted the most interesting parts. I am starting my physical therapy tomorrow. The doctor says that a lot depends on me. Everything will be all right. Sasha, this room is killing me. I want to get out of here as soon as possible. Which one will you have, Daddy? - Strawberry. - Not vanilla? No, now hurry, you'll be late for school. Dad, I need more money, the price went up. Lila. Explain it to me. Can you at least tell me what is going on? Nothing. Nothing is happening. That is the problem. Lila, think about this. Are you threatening me? Are you going to send somebody to beat me up too? I don't understand what you're talking about. You are not controlling your emotions. Or is your conscience bothering you? You don't have to act jealous. You and I both know... I love you. You have never loved me, Milosh. You've loved my father, the professor, and the fact that we had an apartment in the city center. You loved how you have gotten a job through my parents, and the library, the one you have built yourself. You loved your beige bed sheets and a new car with leather seats. You've loved yourself among all those things, where I was just another good-looking trophy. After all these years I thought it's taken for granted that... I am not to be taken for granted! Don't you understand that? You will not get away from me again. Milosh. How do you know when the chicken is done? When did you put it in the oven? Fifteen minutes ago. You wait for an hour and it's done. Are you trying to poison yourself? I went to see Tiosavljevic. It's a bit more serious than I thought. It seems that I will need a surgery. What kind of surgery? And what if it is still frozen in the middle? Milosh, what did the doctor tell you? I don't know. We'll wait until I'm a bit more stable. She left a letter for you. Where are my pills? What is my coat doing in that bag? It's for a retro party. Your style. Where have you been hiding him? Bojan? He's talented and he has a great ass. Those things usually don't go together. Did you bring it for me? I put it in Dad's pill bottle, so he wouldn't suspect. It even says Aspirin on the pill. You can't find this in Paris. What does it say? Aspirin. I have found the envelope in the trash. He has completely lost it. I'll see you tomorrow. - Hi. What did you think? - About what? Me, of course. I think it went okay. Bravo! We got our visas. Great. Where did you disappear? This is Lana, Stefan's sister. Bojan. I thought this whole city was completely fucked up. Thank you! Thank you, this is the most original compliment I've gotten. When are you going to have a normal conversation? Let's go somewhere else, I'm exhausted. Stop by when you are free. You can't hurt me! Cry... Cry... Shut up... Shut up! Shut it! No. You look good. I look terrible. I'm going home. Where is my bag? Oh, no. I can't believe this. I lost my keys. Check again. I always keep them in the side pocket. Stef is going to kill me. Let's go to my place. What are you doing? Checking if you are breathing. Good morning. You must be Sasha's father. Coffee? I'm sorry, but who are you? I'm Lana, Sasha's girlfriend. With sugar? Fuck, that's my dad! So? He is a judge! Are you insane? He won't throw me in jail. Calm down, please. This is not Paris, Lana. We don't tell our parents who we fucked the previous night. If you did, maybe you wouldn't be so fucked up. Maybe your folks would still be together. Leave my parents alone. You don't know me, and you can't talk to me like that. I am Stefan's girlfriend, okay? And I am not gay, do you understand? Then you have perfectly faked that orgasm last night. Call me when you are not mad anymore. I had a nice time last night. Milosh... If I see you again with that lunatic I'll kill both of you. Do you understand? I am going to fix you. You will all respect me! Your own wife doesn't respect you. I have found the letter from the embassy. Where do you think you will go? Hmm? Do you think everybody there is just waiting for you? It took you 2 years to pass 3 exams. What are you going to do when I'm gone? I will start breathing. Here's everything. Witness' statements, telephone numbers, addresses... Sit down, please. - Here you are. - Would you like something to eat? Thanks, but I had a burger on my way here. Judge, are you feeling OK? My daughter hates me. Everything I have done I did because and for her. And she thinks I am her greatest enemy. Nice girl. That was my first impression. I don't know what I did wrong. But tell me Zoran, do you ever go home? Do you ever sleep? No matter how early I get there, you are already in the courthouse. What do your friends and your girlfriend have to say about that? My girlfriend doesn't mind, since I don't have one. The dream I had last night... You wouldn't believe it, that's why I am not telling you about it. Sasha? This is my girlfriend. Nice to meet you. How is the therapy going? Good. What is that on your cheek? Milosh. I can't believe it. What happened? We had a fight. About what? I need to leave that place as soon as possible. Why don't you move to my place? I can't. It'll be just you and Lana, nobody will bother you there. OK, maybe you didn't hit it off, but you'll see she's not that bad once you get to know her better. Where are you going? I need to do something. Hey... I love you. If you could.. just a little... Judge, are you OK? Help me a little. I will, Judge, I will. I wanted to be here for you, you know... Let's try once again. See, it's no use. It was hard for me to look at you like that... Like what? I can't help you, Judge. - Now, I'm sorry but I didn't tidy up. - I can see that. The bed is very comfortable for one, so if you want to bring somebody for the night, don't know if it'll do. It's a living room. - I'm sorry for imposing... - No worries. You have the first dibs on the bathroom. Now, just tell me one thing, does your dad own a gun? No, he is against guns. Although, I wouldn't be surprised if he got one now. Tell me about Lana? What about Lana? What's she like, in bed? Why, are you interested in her? Would you mind? Let me ask you something. Do you have any unresolved issues with your sport pals? There's this blue Suzuki following me the whole aftern- Maybe I got carried away. Talk to you later. What? Look, it's rush hour, I'll talk to you later. If we meet again I am going to start thinking it was a coincidence. I'm really sorry. I had no idea he would react like that. Stefan was right, wherever you show up, disaster ensues. I can't think about Stefan now. What do you want from me? Everything. This is wrong, Lana. When I saw you that day in a hospital, you were so pale... I don't want to spend one more day without you. Why don't you answer it? I know what he is going to say. The easiest thing in life is to be a pussy. Yes, and the hardest thing. Why don't you tell Stefan? He's not my boyfriend. - No, he's your brother. - And he will always be. What's with you? They are fighting, laughing, kissing... Let's go get a coffee somewhere. Sure, you've tortured yourself enough for today. Have you ever been in love? It will be strange when you leave. I got used to you. Just don't say you wish I'd stay here any longer. Tanja? Yes? You are very attractive, very gentle... But? But I always had trouble to stay on 1 track. This thing with Sasha, it's for the first time something serious. Nice. That's my luck. I meet the only faithful man, and he's already in love. Next year it's marathon for us! Your boyfriend is a Superman. Superman is still in a wheelchair. Tomorrow at the same time. I am not sure. I have some obligations. I am out of here on Monday. We'll have to cut ourselves from the world for a couple of days. Stefan... - To make up for the missed time. - Stefan. Something happened to me. What? I should have told you this sooner. I fell in love. I knew it! I am going to fucking kill him! Who? Bojan! I have a girlfriend. What? Lana and I are together. Sasha? I'm sorry. It's going to take him some time to get over it. Like his whole life. - You can really be a bitch sometimes. - I'm only saying what we are both thinking. I ran into Bojan today. Is it possible that you two have never messed around? Lila is waiting for me. Say hi to your mom for me. I would like to meet her. I mean, she did confess her affair to you. We'll all be sick from that much truth. I am going to kick your ass now. Yes! Hey, I was winning! Who is this? I have met him at the video store. Marko. Stanko. Go home. - Bye. - Bye. Are you jealous? Ines, you and me, this living together but separately... I don't think it's going anywhere. I don't mean to be harsh, but I think you should move back in with your parents. Do you have anything to say? Like, finally? Milosh? Milosh? Is that you? How long has it been? Thirty, forty years? It's not possible you don't remember. Mickey, from the orphanage. You have beautiful mouth. So beautiful that it hurts. There are things in this world so beautiful it hurts just looking at them. Why? Because they can never be completely yours. Why? That's the way it is. Beautiful things don't last long. But I know that mouth like yours have the ability to heal with kisses. You could help me. Stop the pain. Where have you been, Judge? I almost didn't find a partner to play. Judge? Milosh? Coming! What, you changed your mind? Lana Stojanovic, owner of the vehicle SAAB convertible, French license plate? What is this? What are all the boxes doing here? Sasha, we are leaving. Sinisa's grandmother died, and left him a flat in Vienna. Wave to him. Thank you. Mom, I am in love too. Stefan is a great guy. Lana. Her name is Lana. She lives in Paris. She is Stefan's sister. In high school, while I still lived there, I had a friend, Miroslava. We were in gymnastics together. One day, after the training, we ended up alone in the change room. I don't know what happened, if there was something in my eyes... She walked up to me, took my hand and put it on her breast. I will never know what would have happened if I hadn't pulled my hand away. It's OK. If that is how you feel. Nobody has yet discovered a recipe for happiness. Would you like to stay for lunch? We're having Chinese chicken with peanuts. OK. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. This is Sasha. Nice to meet you. What a lovely smile. Sinisa is a dentist. Excuse me. Hello? I don't understand. He took everything you have prescribed for him. He said you found a problem with his heart. His heart is fine. I believe that you misunderstood something. I last saw your father three years ago. After his hemorrhoid surgery. You should smoke less. They have pumped his stomach. He will be fine soon. Did Milosh have any problems lately? Was he depressed? Why? I believe that your father took medication on his own. I don't understand. Why would he be doing that? That is exactly what I wanted to ask you. I am sorry, but can I please talk to somebody? I have been in here the entire afternoon. Yes, you can talk to yourself. Get away from me. - Come in. - Wait, this must be some kind of a mistake. - It's always a mistake. - Can I make a phone call? I have a right to a phone call, I want to call somebody. Wait! Lana? Lana? Bojan? Boki, open the door. I know you are here! Lana? It's you. I understand perfectly if you hate me. I would feel the same. Where have you been? I have been waiting for you the entire night. And? How was it? What? I have called you a million times, both you and Bojan were unavailable. Fuck you. You had to choose him. Slut. Maybe I can help you! Give you an advice of something! Hey, I am still here, your brother and your boyfriend! Ex-boyfriend. I've had enough of you, do you hear me? Let her go! Don't you think I could act like you? You stupid whore, think for once, think! Some things you will never understand. My sister and my girlfriend. Perfectly understandable. Leave her alone! Luckily, we will live with that understanding on different continents. Get out. Both of you. I can't look at you anymore. Get out! Look, Sasha, I came here to help my brother, and to rest... - This has become too complicated. - Lana... - We can't pretend Stefan doesn't exist. - Where were you last night? - Does it matter? - Tell me. - Why don't you ask your father? - Dad? What has Milosh got to do with it? Sasha, wake up. It was a beautiful dream. I hope you will fall in love again. I didn't hear you come in. Turn on the lights, please. There is no sun in this room. What did the doctor say? He says that you will receive a thank-you note from the pharmacy. You have been taking all those pills for weeks, and you are perfectly healthy. No, not weeks, months. I thought if I took those pills, if I grew ill, that Lila would... She was always sensitive when it came to illness. You lied to me. No, I didn't. I really wasn't feeling well from the pills. Lila didn't even notice. She left with that kid... You have both left me. Give me some water, please. What did you do to Lana, Milosh? I had to protect you somehow. You would have suffered your entire life from it. It's a sickness. How would you know? You have never been in love. You have never suffered, nothing ever bothered you. You have never lived. At least I have tried. No, Milosh. You have ruined everything. Call the doctor. I am not-I am not feeling well! Give me nitroglycerin from my pocket. This? Dad? Dad! Wait, she said she'd be here. Let's have some coffee. You didn't forget anything? Boki? We'll have a great time. What is wrong, why aren't you saying anything? Boki? What is wrong, Bojan? You are not listening to me. This is not Paris, Lana. We don't tell our parents who we fucked the previous night. If you did, maybe you wouldn't be so fucked up. Maybe your folks would still be together. Now that I know that I don't have you anymore my thoughts keep running to you, but I am not letting them. I don't think about you, you are not filling my hours of loneliness, I don't see your face, I am fighting. But I dream of you, dream of you, I dream that I can see you, that you're here. I dream of you, dream of you, dream that you are kissing me, that you are here... I dream... Now that I know that I don't have you anymore my thoughts keep running to you, but I am not letting them. I don't think about you, you are not filling my hours of loneliness, I don't see your face, I am fighting. But I dream of you, dream of you, I dream that I can see you, that you're here. I dream of you, dream of you, dream that you are kissing me, that you are here... I DREAM... Translation: Babykate. Subtitles: Junkyjunk.
