Suddenly you think, we could do the old arenas that we used to do and we now have somebody who can act as a focus and a channel.

After Live Aid, there was nothing gonna stop them. The world was theirs. And they really could have gone anywhere with it had it not been for the fact that it kind of coincided with Fred's illness. Freddie Mercury died last night of AIDS. There have been tributes to his talent and his courage from friends and from fans. He only admitted publicly that he had AIDS the day before he died when he also appealed to his fans to help combat the disease. I mean, I remember when Freddie died, a lot of people saw it as being like, "You're not gonna be able to overcome this tragedy. "You're not gonna be able to recapture any of the old magic. You're not gonna find someone who can front a band like Queen." The idea that Queen could have continued without Freddie Mercury, no way, no way. You'd say, knee-jerk, "No way." And yet here we are. It wasn't until this young man appeared, I call him a gift from God, Adam. We didn't ask for him. We didn't look for him. We didn't have a recipe book or whatever with bullet points.

Every time I walk to the stage with these guys, I have to pinch myself. I'm like, "Oh, my god. "Is this real life? Or is it just fantasy?" The biggest trip that I was going through was the fact that I knew that by singing these songs as the lead singer in this moment that I was going to inevitably be compared to Freddie. I know that some of you out there are probably thinking, few of you are probably like... "He's no Freddie Mercury, though." No shit. People know the songs because of the recordings. I learned the songs because of the recordings. Freddie's unbelievable. His voice was one in a million, zillion, trillion. There will only be, for all of time, one rock god, Freddie Mercury. I'm filling in for this god, and I'm not him. And I knew that I wasn't Freddie. Thank you for giving me a chance. Thank you. We're not trying to recreate our dear Freddie.

He does it in his own way, and I think that's what's really amazing.

This is all a bonus, you know? We could have all disappeared and gone back to different kind of jobs, you know, if it weren't for the fact that we had Adam. It's astonishing to me to look back on it and realise we thought it was the end. And in a sense, it was. We are here tonight to celebrate the life, and work, and dreams of one Freddie Mercury. We're gonna give him the biggest send off in history. We, over a long period, accustomed ourselves to the idea that we were gonna do a tribute to Freddie, and it did take a while. And then it was actually Roger who pressed the button and said, "OK, we're ringing these people up, and we'll see if they'll come." OK, today is for Freddie, it's for you, it's to tell everybody around the world that AIDS affects us all. So, we were ringing up a lot of our heroes, so everybody who was kind of in the same river as Freddie. So, suddenly, we're performing with David Bowie and Robert Plant.

I said, "You need to stand here and look at this because you will never ever see this again." If this is the end, what a way to go. And for the first time, I looked out and I thought, "Ah, how amazing." You know, this amount of love got poured out to our friend. Goodnight, Freddie. We love you. We felt that would be probably the last time we would play our songs together. It was a very strange era, a very strange period for us 'cause, you know, we had sort of lost Fred. We were a little bit sort of concussed by the whole thing. I did leave Wembley feeling, "That's it. Now, I've seen the last one." 'Cause you couldn't imagine there being anything else. What else could there be? Everyone who was around us, we just all cried. It was... it was extremely emotional. It was the end of part of my life. When Freddie died, Queen died. And I thought the interest has got to dwindle. When something's not there, not touring, not recording, physically, it will die. Do you think you're going to get to heaven? No. I don't want to. You don't want to? No. Hell is much better. Look at the interesting people that you're gonna meet down there. I don't really think about, "Oh, my god, when I'm dead, "are they gonna remember me?"

It was a sort of grieving process, I think. It's like we don't want to talk about Queen. We don't want to be Queen. We've done that. We want to be ourselves now. Now, we go off and we do our separate things, which perhaps we've all been dreaming of, you know, Roger has always done lots of solo projects. So, he went straight back into that. I hadn't done a lot of solo stuff, but I went out and sang. ♪ I don't believe in ♪ Being Queen anymore ♪ I just believe in me ♪ After Freddie died, um, it took me a year to even want to start about thinking, doing things, just settle down and try and, you know, live with the present and see how you feel. John sort of freaked out and decided he really couldn't deal with being in the music business anymore, you know? So, it was an odd period, that. Really, the band was over. ♪ Seaside Whenever you stroll along with me ♪ I'm merely contemplating what you feel inside ♪ Meanwhile... ♪ We were living in San Diego. It was a nice place to raise kids. When Adam was younger, he didn't quite fit in, didn't like sports very much. We tried soccer, we tried T-ball, and it just wasn't his thing. And he would do a lot of acting out fantasy things. And he would ask me to film him and take pictures while he was dancing or singing. And we thought, "You know, there's got to be another outlet." And they put me in a theatre group that rehearsed on the weekends. It was a big children's theatre. And I remember the first Saturday I went, I was instantly like "I've found my people." It's exciting to be in children's theatre 'cause you just get... I mean, it's just really exciting going out on stage in front of a lot of people and performing. We ended up taking him for voice lessons, and he got on stage one day and sang, and we had absolutely no idea that he had that voice. It was in 'Fiddler on the Roof'. I think, into my teenage years, it started becoming clear that I was getting attention for it more than the other kids, which I loved. And as a strange kid who was kind of ashamed of his body, in the closet, and whole list of other insecurities, having something that I was good at and that got me a lot of attention became sort of medicine for me in a way. Being just a human on this earth, I encountered Queen. I definitely had heard songs of theirs around. But the first time I really asked who is this band was after seeing 'Wayne's World'. This is actually the theatre we used to come to fairly regularly. It's only a few miles from our house. And I'm pretty sure we saw 'Wayne's World' here. ♪ Beelzebub Has a devil put aside for me ♪ For me, for me. ♪ It was so much fun, that scene, and I left that movie theatre with my father and my little brother, and I asked my dad like, "What song was that?" He was like, "Oh, that's Queen." And when we got home that night, he showed me some albums that he had of Queen. I really fell in love with rock'n'roll and everything that was the '70s. And that's when I really got to dive into Queen and their catalogue. ♪ Yeah! ♪ Come tonight Come tonight. ♪ Adam would watch Freddie Mercury, he would watch videos, he would just try to get a feel for how he performed and what he did on stage. I was just delighted to see this guy running around the stage in these strange outlandish outfits, you know, his harlequin jumpsuit, or his PVC leather daddy look, or his little itty-bitty white shorts and no shoes. For me, seeing somebody that got on stage, which was the place that I knew very well, and acted the way he did and sang and performed the way he did, I was instantly inspired. And I felt like there was some sort of kinship. And I was just like, "This guy was fearless." It definitely inspired me. I wasn't there yet though. I was fearful at that point in my life. You know, I was auditioning, always terrified, always, "Oh, god, what will they think of me? "Will they like me? Am I good enough? I don't know." Very doubtful. He did things on and off. He got a gig doing that musical 'Hair' in Europe and the cruise ship. And so, he was starting to make a living as a singer. That was the path that I was on that I thought I would probably stay on. I was in California, not New York. And I kept kind of saying, "I'll move to New York soon." I was terrified actually. I knew that I would have been a very, very small fish in a big pond. I just didn't feel like I was ready yet. I've lived long enough to see gigantic stars fade into nothingness. It is possible to fade. So, the crucial decision was when Jim Beach, their manager, he said to me, "Queen are going to be a current band. They're not gonna be an oldies group." Some of Freddie's last words were, "Do what you want, just never make me boring." It took us five years to get over the shock of losing Freddie. But Brian and I were still close and still friends and, you know, still running what you call the brand, the business of a band like Queen. The musical, 'We Will Rock You', softened the blow in a sense 'cause you have something you can put your creativity in. It was a chance to take our music to a different place and develop it with new artists, young artists who have fantastic voices and fantastic ability. I love the whole 'We Will Rock You' thing. I think Roger had misgivings about the whole thing. I hate the medium of musical theatre. I absolutely hate it. For the first two years, when it was on dominion, I was in there almost every night, just learning and tweaking and trying things out. And it was like having Queen there, I suppose, you know, outside ourselves. It was great. It filled the gap. That musical reignited the Queen flame and people started talking about Queen. But it's not being a performer on stage. Now, you do miss that. If you've been a performer all your life, you do. And those moments when I would come up through the trap door in 'We Will Rock You' in clouds of smoke and be the guitar hero with all the white spotlights. Suddenly, I was part of this lovely baby that we had created. I was part of the creation. I was in there. I loved doing that. It was such a fulfilling moment. When Brian and Roger played at the musical, the place erupted. People wanted to see them live. You know the audience is there. Therefore, it's just a question of coming to peace with oneself. How do we reengage with this existing audience? Totally different challenge from when they were a new group. How do we grow an audience? This is, how do you engage with the existing audience? To benefit Nelson Mandela's AIDS charities, they organised a huge concert in Cape Town. We answered the call to Madiba, Nelson Mandela is suddenly on the phone saying, "Can you rescue my concert?" And we produced it for him, and we went out there. And we really didn't imagine that the by-product would be that we would be reengaging with an audience. Something to tell your grandchildren I think. To be in the presence of such greatness and to be a part of this whole venture, I just feel incredibly privileged. ♪ We are the champions ♪ My friends. ♪ A moment like that, Cape Town episode, can't help but remind you this is the biggest audience participation act of all time. Everybody wants to play to the biggest audiences ever. I want to play to as many people as I can. And the more the merrier, you know? 'Cause my music is for everybody. Music is limitless. Queen have this intimate relationship with tens of thousands of people at one time. You can't turn your back on it without feeling guilty. ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah! ♪ It dawned on me that I was being rather silly, you know, in denying Queen because we'd spent major portion of our lives building up this edifice and this catalogue and this whole kind of universe, which is Queen, you know, the content of the lyrics, content of the music, and the spirit that goes with it. Why would I be denying it? If I didn't do this, I don't have anything to do, you know? I can't cook. I'm not very good at being a housewife. There was hell lot of hope because, Brian and Roger, you don't want to keep that Lamborghini in the garage. You know, you got to drive that fucking car every once in a while. So, I was hoping that they would find someone. We've done odd gigs, you know, as Queen, in a sense, you know, using guest artists. It was just... I remember saying, not many months ago, when somebody said, "You know, can you do a Queen tour? Can you call it 'Queen'?" And I said, "Well, no, not really, not barring a miracle. "If there's a miracle that we find the right person to sing, then yes." ♪ Lately I've been hard to reach ♪ I've been too long on my own. ♪ Even though we were proud of what we had done, we didn't want to go out there and be Queen again without Freddie. And it happened almost by accident. At an award show, I played with Paul Rodgers, who was the hero of ours. And I remember coming offstage and Paul's lady said, "Oh, you guys seem to really have a great chemistry. All you need is a drummer." And I went like, "I think I know a drummer." Brian and I find that we still have the magic on stage. So, it's great to be doing this with a different singer, but the magic of Queen is absolutely still there. ♪ Tie your mother down Tie your mother down ♪ Lock your daddy out of doors I don't need him nosin' around ♪ Tie your mother down Tie your mother down ♪ Give me all your love tonight. ♪ In retrospect, I think perhaps, Queen were maybe thinking, "We're not gonna ever find someone who can be the next Freddie. "So, let's go the opposite direction "and just do something completely different "with someone who just not... doesn't sound like Freddie, doesn't look like Freddie, it's just his own thing." He enjoyed playing a lot of the Queen stuff, not all of it, you know, not all of it suited him, but it was a good combination for a while. We ended up going all around the world a couple of times with Paul. I would still go to shows and think, "Well, we used to do that." You know, we used to play in arenas or whatever. And suddenly, out of the blue, we are in the same arena again, and how incredible that we can still do that and people still want to come and fill those arenas, and we can still rock the hell out of them. ♪ Till one day they call your name ♪ You know it's time For the hammer to fall. ♪ He was his own man and he belonged in the sort of blues soul field, which there is no better. Our stuff is a little bit too eclectic probably. So, I think that's why that came to an end. After that, I kind of figured that was it. I really thought, "There's no way. "You can't replace Freddie Mercury. "You can't replace an icon. You just can't." And again, I think Roger and I thought, "OK, that's it. "You know, we've done that, we've done this, you know, and there is nobody out there." We don't want to employ someone to copy Freddie. Why would we do that? It just wouldn't make sense. First of all, you got to find a charisma. Then you got to find someone with a vocal range because Freddie's vocal range was off the chart. I mean, he could sing classical rock, pop. So, there weren't many of those people who ticked all those boxes. Yeah. Hi. Don't be scared. I'm not scared. Hi. At that point, I had said goodbye to a lot of my fear and found who I was as a performer, truly. Are you our next Idol? I think so. Really? He's been in the cast of 'Wicked'. Alright. What are you gonna sing for us? 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. Yeah. Soul rock. Yeah. Oh, it's his favourite. Is that cool? It's your favourite. Come on. You like that? OK. It just said everything about Adam, which was... Yeah, let's make life even harder for yourself and sing probably the biggest rock track of all time. ♪ Mama, just killed a man ♪ Put a gun against his head ♪ Pulled my trigger, now he's dead ♪ Mama, life has just begun ♪ But now, I've gone and thrown it all away. ♪ OK. OK. I think you're a really good singer. Thank you. I think you're one of the most diverse singers we've heard. Thank you. Yeah, I'm gonna give you my opinion for what it's worth. I think you are theatrical. I wasn't in a great mood that day. Is he a good singer, though? We had started early. It was awful. So, I wasn't jumping out of my chair. If he's a good singer, do we put him through at this point? I don't there's no... Well, that's up to you, we each have our own individual votes. But he's one of my favourite contestants ever. Theatrical? Yes. But you've got a good voice. And for right now, that's what we're looking at. OK, well, you got three yeses. So... And I think... and I think you... No, you have four yeses. You're brilliant. I remember watching his audition when he sang 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. And the coaches, like, kind of just trying to decide whether or not they want him on the show, I'm like, "This guy just needs a record deal. What are you doing?" It was only when we got to the live shows where I suddenly... we all started to suddenly see this star emerge. There were a few times on the show where he had what I call a moment. It's a moment that will change your career. And he did that more than once. ♪ Stars when you shine ♪ You know how I feel ♪ Scent of the pine ♪ You know how I feel ♪ Oh, freedom is mine ♪ And you know how I feel ♪ It's a new dawn It's a new day ♪ It's a new life ♪ Oh, for me ♪ For me ♪ Yeah! ♪ I thought this guy is obviously the most talented of this group and will go the farthest, but he's not gonna win. And the reason he's not gonna win is 'cause he's obviously gay. It was the Myspace era and a lot of the TMZ-type blogs had uncovered a lot of old photos of Adam Lambert kissing his then boyfriend and acted like it was some big scandal. So, he was on the cover of 'Entertainment Weekly' that said something like Adam Lambert is probably gay. By the time I got to 'Idol', I was 27. And I had been going through most of my 20s in LA very openly and proudly gay. So, I kind of figured like, "Oh, it's already out of the bed. "Yeah, that's me. Like, they know, I know. Yeah, that's it." I never said the words, "I am gay." And I didn't really realise that I had to make that type of literal statement. Adam Lambert wanted the focus to be on him as a singer, not on any aspect of his personal life. And so, he chose not to publicly address these photographs. And so, that swirl of intrigue, I guess, continued along with him as he performed phenomenally week after week on 'American Idol' and became one of the most popular contestants on that show ever. Towards the end of 'American Idol' season eight, Adam Lambert did 'Whole Lotta Love'. ♪ You need coolin' Baby, I'm not foolin...' ♪ Led Zeppelin had never cleared a song for 'American Idol'. And I imagine that Led Zeppelin said, "Well, yeah, this guy's not gonna mess up our song." ♪ Way down inside ♪ Honey, you need it ♪ I'm gonna give you my love ♪ Oh... ♪ Want a whole lotta love. ♪ I wrote at that time that it was the best 'American Idol' performance of all time.

Adam was on TV, and I immediately got a chill from what I was hearing. ♪ Keep it coolin', baby ♪ Keep it coolin', baby. ♪ I thought, "Wow, this kid's special and he's got something and great set of pipes." And I could see that he had charisma, and he looked fantastic. When he got to the end, when he sings "Woman, you need love", which is the big moment, the money shot of the song, and he just sang it effortlessly. ♪ Woman ♪ You need ♪ Love! ♪ I thought, "This is great." So, I sent an email to Roger. Adam, you're more than a rockstar, you're a rock god. That's what you are, OK? Thank you. It was actually one of my favourite performances you've ever done. The only problem is nobody can top that now. My first thought was that, "Oh, this guy is... Amazing voice. And for me, he's Camp Elvis." Well, I have one criticism. I thought the performance was a little-understated. He's got this magnetism about him coupled with this amazing voice. Countless people sent me emails and rang me up and said, "You got to see this guy. "He's your next guy. He's the guy you need to be on stage with." So, we looked and thought, "Hmm." Welcome back to the show. In a few short minutes, either Kris Allen or Adam Lambert will walk away with the title. The 'American Idol' people asked us to come in and play on the final competition night. So, it was between Adam and this other guy. And we played 'We Are The Champions' with both of them as frontmen. They are the type of guys who still love performing. They put their egos to one side because they actually like working with new stars. ♪ We are the champions ♪ My friends ♪ And we'll keep on fighting ♪ Till the end. ♪ Just meeting them for the first time, it was so surreal.

So, I was thrilled, even though I didn't win, I was the runner-up, I knew that, in my way, I had one, I had one for myself, for my life. His life was kind of booked for the next year or so. So, there's no question of us going off with him at that moment. That couldn't have happened. Nevertheless, we kept loosely in touch. 'American Idol' would have sent him on a very different trajectory. He wasn't gonna put an album out that was gonna be handpicked producers and writers from, you know, the American Idol's table. The fact that he didn't win is probably the best thing that ever happened to him. ♪ So hot out the box Can we pick up the pace? ♪ Turn it up, heat it up I need to be entertained. ♪ After 'Idol' is done, he does interviews with 'Rolling Stone' and the ABC News, where he says, "Yes, I'm gay. This isn't some big secret." He wasn't coming out in the sense that his life had been hidden in any way. He was just acknowledging a truth about his life. It was a relief. I mean, I've been open about my sexuality since I've been an adult. You know, there were people who felt that you should have kept your sexuality a mystery. I know. I'm very open book. I kind of wear myself on my sleeve. Yes, I am a homosexual. Deal with it. Yeah, yeah, I'm gay. What? And? You didn't know? You couldn't tell? Ladies and gentlemen, making his debut performance with his first single, Adam Lambert. There's great anticipation, "What will Adam Lambert do as a solo artist?" And he comes out and he does 'For Your Entertainment'. If you were looking for a performance that would reunite Adam Lambert's 'American Idol' fan base, this wasn't it. The thing starts off and he's got a really sexy female dancer, and he's pulling around by her leg. And then he's got the guy on all fours, and he's got him on a leash. But then he did something in live performance that he hadn't told anybody he was going to do. That on live television is a no-no. You know, he simulated fellatio with one of his dancers. I didn't plan it. It just happened, which is why I think the network got mad at me because they were like, "We didn't know that was coming." "I didn't either." And then takes the back of Tommy the keyboardist and kisses him. There were a lot of people that were like, "That's not for me." It's sort of alienated a portion of my new audience that I had gained on 'American Idol'. A lot of Adam Lambert's appearances that were supposed to happen on TV got cancelled, everyone was like, "His career is over." I think I felt everyone pulled back a bit. I felt something shift after that performance and after that single sort of didn't connect. So, from a business standpoint, I was like, "OK, got it." ♪ Hey, slow it down ♪ What do you want from me? ♪ What do you want from me? ♪ Thankfully, we had a song that we came with as the second single, which actually kind of asked the question to all the people that were upset about what I had done and said, "What do you want from me?

Thank you. They had an opportunity to perform at the AMAs. And when they asked me, I immediately said yes, it was like a knee-jerk reaction, "Yes, of course." Hung up the phone and then started panicking and going, "Oh, my god, this is crazy 'cause this is a big deal." ♪ Empty spaces What are we living for? ♪ Abandoned places I guess we know the score ♪ It was obvious to me that he had everything you would want in a frontman.

You know, you can't have one, you got to have both. The thing All of us sat down and we had a drink. And there was a sense of camaraderie in that moment about, "Look what we just did. This feels good. I like you." "I like you." "You like me?" It was an instant sense of sort of comfort and ease that we all had with each other. We all sort of got a kick out of each other, and it felt like the right fit, it felt good. With Adam, by the time we got together, we kind of knew, yeah, because we'd seen enough of him, and we thought, "Yeah, this is gonna work." You know, Adam comes with a certain amount of pedigree because he's selling his solo stuff with a lot of success. So, then we sat down together and said, "Well, what could we do? We could do a little bit of a tour. We could try something here, try something there." And it gradually took shape. And before we knew it, we were, you know, operating with Adam. One, two, check, check, check. We had some shows, about six shows, I think, in Europe, starting with a massive show in Kiev. I think it must have been the most terrifying moment for Adam. He didn't look like it was terrifying. He looked like he did this every day. I definitely was intimidated by the idea of singing somebody else's song, especially from such a beloved band. In the back of my head, I was like, "Oh, god, I hope this is the right idea", you know? I'm so excited to sing these songs. But I don't know how it's gonna be received. There was a tall order. And I think we all knew it. And that gig was put in at the front of the tour to enormous numbers of people. I think it was more than 350,000. And it was live TV as well. Well, it was free, wasn't it? Just say it was a million. Elton John was on before us. And I remember, as Elton was rolling out hit after hit after hit, I remember thinking, "Hope we're up to this." When you face an audience of some 300,000 people... Mmm. ..do you get intimidated by the size of the crowd? No, the bigger the better... in everything. Adam had to do, in his first show with Queen, what it took Queen and Freddie Mercury ten years today. ♪ Hey, hey ♪ Hey, hey, hey ♪ Hey, hey, hey... ♪ Some people would be embarrassed to go to Kiev and sing in front of 300,000 people they've never known. But a performer like Adam could use it as an opportunity, just as Freddie had always used these big crowds, just push that envelope. Let's see how many people we can get to respond at once. He did have experience performing for large crowds on TV. And he had experience performing for doubters. He was used to having to win people over. And, you know, all of that was a perfect storm with him. When he got in front of hundreds of thousands of people in Kiev, he'd already been selling himself for years. He knew how to do it. I had a lot of help. Spike who was on keys, I kept looking at over and over again, like, "Am I supposed to come in here? How long is the guitar solo? Is it my turn?" Because of his stage training, he was quite happy to take cues. He used to just check in with me and I'd give him a yes if it was right, no if it was wrong, meaning, wait. Just a lot of me being like... He looks at me, I went, "No, not that. Don't sing that bit."

I took my hat off to him at the time. Ladies and gentlemen, Adam Lambert! No, Queen! And of course, the rest was easy after that. Queen is huge everywhere, the UK in particular, they're huge, huge, huge. In the States, it's a bit different of a relationship. So, I felt like it was maybe even a harder sell. There is that perception that, you know, something hasn't happened until it's actually happened here in America. I don't think anyone thought that Adam Lambert and Queen coming together was a slam dunk. They were viewed in America as a heritage rock act that had hits, but they didn't have that young audience that expected to hear new music from them or be able to see them live. The first public performance Queen did in America was at the iHeartRadio Music Festival in Las Vegas. I knew it was a big deal to come to Vegas and prove ourselves as a collaboration. iHeartRadio, are you ready for another I-can't-believe-it moment? Please welcome Queen featuring Adam Lambert. ♪ This thing called love ♪ I just can't handle it ♪ This thing called love ♪ I must get round to it ♪ I ain't ready ♪ Crazy little thing called love ♪ This thing ♪ This thing ♪ Called love ♪ Called love ♪ It cries ♪ Like a baby ♪ Like a baby all night ♪ It swings ♪ Woo woo ♪ It jives ♪ Woo woo ♪ It shakes all over like a jellyfish ♪ I kinda like it ♪ This crazy little thing called love It went really well.

You know, there's no way of getting to a country quicker than live TV.

He gave us a blood transfusion if you like, young blood, nothing like it. Thank you. The iHeart reaction was great. There was immediately buzz and talk about "Could Queen go on tour?" Some people said, "No-one is gonna pay to see the band without Freddie." Other people thought there is a demand from this audience that wants to hear these songs live. We actually had Adam and Queen at Madison Square Garden to announce it. And it felt like this very big moment, the band touring America for the first time in I don't know how many years, and the press went crazy. We're delighted to be announcing a tour of North America. It's just such a delight for us. We're very excited, I have to say. It's been a while. But this is a combination which we believe really works very well. It'll be great to do this one more time now. And this is the man to do it with. I'm like, "Whoa! Really?" I'm so excited to be asked by these two gentlemen to share the stage with them. Feels incredible. We put together a pretty ambitious tour, playing 15 to 20 arenas around North America. People are gonna say to us, "You know, is this really Queen without Freddie?" Well, I have no idea. But people want to hear Queen music. They want to hear it done great. So, having this opportunity is great. ♪ Um ba ba be ♪ Um ba ba be... ♪ We looked at venues where they had these iconic performances in the past.

One of the great things about being on stage with Queen is that I've challenged myself to try to find my own personal connection to the lyrics of their songs 'cause I feel like, without that connection, whether I wrote it or not, it doesn't really come alive for the audience, you know?

You have to sort of... And so, I think you are handicapped. Freddie lived in a time where, you know, only years prior, it was illegal to be homosexual. I can only think of the stigma that he must have had to live with. Adam Lambert lives in a different time, and I feel he's able to take advantage of some of the doors that Freddie opened for him. ♪ Love! ♪ Hit it. When Trespassing, Adam's sophomore album, debuted at number one, it was the first time that an openly gay musician had debuted at number one. Freddie Mercury paved that road for him. I was told this is the first time that somebody that's been out since they got signed that this has happened to, and it made me really proud. It made me proud just to be able to, like, you know, tell my grandkids one day or whatever, you know? ♪ Love! ♪ Sometimes, I think to myself, "What would Freddie be like if he were alive today?" And something tells me that he would have gotten more open as the time's changed a bit. I'm out and proud and in a society where I feel like I can be open. And it's a journey which we're all happy that the world has made, but it's not over yet. You know, there is still prejudice. There's still all sorts of abuses that go on. Good evening from Orlando, the focal point of a nation still reeling from the carnage that took place just up the street at the Pulse nightclub. Shocking stories of survival, harrowing escapes, and heroic acts in the face of relentless hate. This song is dedicated... to those who lost their life last night... In Orlando, Florida... And anybody that has been victim of senseless violence or hatred. ♪ There's no time for us ♪ There's no place for us ♪ That morning, I remember hearing about the Pulse shooting in Orlando and just thinking to myself, "That could have been any club.

Queen built up to a point where they could headline the Hollywood Bowl again, and it would be the hottest ticket in town. And then the 'Bohemian Rhapsody' movie came out. In the 'Bohemian Rhapsody' movie, Freddie Mercury's going out with Mary. And he's calling her from a truck stop. And he's still grappling with his own sexuality. And there's this hunky trucker. Well, that trucker is played by Adam Lambert. If you had just closed the door, I could have had it. Oh. I could have had that. I was like, "Oh, hey, how are you doing?" You do feel there are two worlds of Queen colliding in that moment. The movie has made a lot of young people hear Queen music for the very first time. And how cool would that be that a band that was written off 30 years ago becomes the band that makes rock cool again for the kids? Like, how cool is that? What's actually been quite sort of dumbfounded is that we've actually stayed together all these years. And when you think about it, I mean, we are the only sort of, you know, four grand dames that have actually sort of stuck together. We have to survive and we have to survive together. And so many groups who are on the brink of the world's riches don't realise that. They suddenly think they're too big for the group and they disappear off. And they throw away the magic, which is a group which works together. It's something very precious. If you find it in your lifetime, even once, you're so lucky. And we are incredibly lucky. We found it twice, I have to say. When we very first met Adam, he appeared to be more of a boy. I now see him as an incredibly accomplished man. Roger and I have a better relationship than we used to have. And that's important. You know, we disagree on almost everything, but we have that kind of mutual respect. And when we get to play together, something happens. And it was always there from the beginning, like way back to the jazz club room in 1969 or whenever it was. A long time ago, isn't it? Chop, chop. - All right, then? - All right? Let's do it. Have a good one. Yeah. Nice one. It's family now. And it does feel like when we're walking to stage together before a show, "Here we go.

Seeing the energy and the magnetism that they still have, it truly is indescribable. The best artists, I think, are like ambassadors to the past and also to the future. And if he can be the bridge that makes the younger kids want to find out more about this Freddie guy, it's a win-win situation. Without this guy, none of this would be happening right now. We'd all be at home with our slippers, you know? Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Adam Lambert! Freddie, I know for a fact, would look at what Adam is doing and say, "Wow, how do you do some of that stuff?" Does he sing or what? "There you go, bitch," you know, he'd love it. The voice is stupendous. There is not another voice like that in this planet. I think he's the best singer around. I don't know anybody that can outsing Adam Lambert. I really don't. I can't believe I'm here. I'm really lucky. And I know I'm not Freddie, but I'm here. So, I'm gonna sing the songs and do my best, and let's have a good time.
