And Satan leads the ball Finish with that statement. Here's the garage owner. - Good morning, Mr. Monot. - Good morning, chief ! A bad day for you ! The car is badly damaged ? Upside down in a ditch. 300 thousand worth of repairs at least ! 300 thou worth of damage. Were the garage plates on ? No. It's a catastrophe ! The insurance won't pay ! Whose car is it ? Some American's. He wanted me to sell it. This young gentleman had the cars test driven by customers without my knowing. You damn fool ! If I press charges, they'll keep you here. Mr. Monot, can we talk in private ? If you press charges, I might go to jail but... you'll have to pay the 300 thou.... You are penniless anyway... I can find the money... tomorrow at the latest. I don't believe you. I came down here with a girl. She is loaded. Why were you working ? Her father has got the money... He thinks she is in some school, in Switzerland. He'll get mad. He'll get mad but he'll pay. Those people don't like scandal. His name and address. I'd rather take care of it myself. You'll take care of it but I want his name. Martin Klaus. - Martin Klaus... - K L A U S His address ? 9 b Avenue ... I want to hear from you tonight at the latest. Else... A port in the sun is pretty, isn't it ? It could be paradise. But the sun is poisoned. All the beauty of things is poisoned. I say to myself that today it's all right, I manage.... But what about tomorrow ? Hey... What happened to you ? Nothing... I fell down. Poor Ivan ! Something always happens to you ! You're angry ? Manuelle ! What's the trouble ? I'm in real trouble. Is it serious ? You can say that, yes ! Listening to you, everything is serious. I'm no mood to have you make fun of me. Tomorrow, I'll be in jail. I smashed up a car and it was not insured. If I can't find 300 thousand francs before tonight... I'll be arrested for theft. If you go to prison, I'll go there with you. You had better help me find the money. I haven't got any money. What about your father ? You must be crazy ! Why ? He's loaded, isn't he ? Phone him ! Tell him you need money... Well... think of something ! But... Ivan... You don't know what my father is like... He loves you, doesn't he ? Yes, he does. But in his way ! He never understands anything. Your father is not so frightening ! - He scares me ! I must have been crazy to follow you here. Crazy about you ! Really crazy ! Anyway... he must suspect you're not in Geneva any more. He doesn't ! I wrote five or six letters before I left And a friend of mine sends them every three days. What have we got to lose ? We've got to try. Shoot at everything that moves. I beg you to believe me ! Telling my father would be the worst thing to do. I've got an idea ! What if we sold your car ? That wreck ? I wouldn't get 50 thou for it. Oh ! Wait ! What if I asked Jean-Claude ? If I gave him 50 or a hundred, the garage owner might wait. He refused 3 days ago ! Yes... But things were different ! Today it's more serious. In Geneva, you already said the same thing. But it was only a matter of money. I had missed that paintings deal ! It's always a matter of money ! Well... Ask Jean-Claude if you feel like it. Shoot at everything that moves ! It's always when you don't want to move that you must leave ! Tomorrow... Paris's gray skies ! Eric's cocktail ! Give it to me, will you ? Enjoy the last rays of the sun, girly ! Jean-Claude! I need to talk to you ! Look how graceful and easy it is ! Damn ! It will be expensive ! Anyway, my future does not lie there. My future is in industry ! As Father says... Plastic and crylor are the two ways to dough. Ah, they're after me ! Take a card ! No...I'm in real trouble ! Right ! It's confidential ! Writers are held by professional confidentiality. Aren't they ? - A tomb ! I've just crashed up a car ! It will cost 300 thou at least ! Don't touch it, Monica ! Tails ! - Tails! - Settles it ! We're staying ! So... you'd leave your publisher in such solemn circumstance ! Courageous ! - Clever mostly ! Tr?sor besieges me. Two hours later, he can't forget ! Away... The journalists wonder... The result is a full week of talking drums... Believe me... Absence is the best publicity. And what about your book ? Your child ? - A little bastard ! - Yes but what about literature ? Has to be reinvented ! You don't say ! I see a little girl who's interested in culture ! Einstein, ?tretat... Oh, what a naughty girl ! She took the United States... I'll bring them back to you. I'll sail to America soon. You won't get bored ! All those American women... American women ! Those coin machines of love ! No !You know my obsession : you're so beautiful, pure, unreachable... The Victory of Samothrace ! On whom I'd wear my nails down until blood... Speaking of blood, I'm dying of thirst. Beer, scotch, tonic ? - Tonic ! Burbling... Well... I'm waiting... Burbling.... Wait a minute ! Look ! - How beautiful ! How beautiful it is ! - It reminds me of you ! Thank you ! You changed perfume ? - You noticed ? I notice everything about you. It's a normal thing ! Love increases a man's mnemotechnical faculties tenfold. But... ah yes... the... The talent for remarking. Eric, you've really decided not to attend that party ? Absolutely ! You mustn't make them wait any more. Your publisher knows you're here. You must hide ! And do it quickly ! What a woman ! Burbling : talking about trifle ! You can't be beaten ! Listen to me... can you... It's the last time. I swear ! I'm in real trouble. After that, I'm on something great ! Is it the whole story ? - Yes! You found something new. Congratulations ! The story of the crashed down car is a good one... But unfortunately, I don't believe you. I can as well leave then ! - Do that ! Could you let me stay at your place ? At my place ? - In your parents' house. Time for me to find something else. That's a good idea ! My friends ! I have a hiding place for you near here. My parent's house ! It's unoccupied ! Sold ? -Sold ! I'll go. There's a cook called Maria who makes a marvelous paella ! A great one ! - But that woman is greedy ! She is ! She raised me so I know... I'm coming too ? Am I ? You were not invited ! Pity ! She is pretty ? - Do I know her ? - The Victory of Samothrace, pal ! If that's so... I can't even buy petrol for my car. Ten ! Twenty ! I must pay the hotel bill. And that's it ! See you later ! - I want to see the girl first. All we have to do is find her now ! And you know some girls around here ? Yeah ! I do ! Yes ! - What ? Yes ? No... I only saw them ! - That's better ! - Let's go that way, shall we ? Let's ! We'll never find her ! Of course, we shall ! Look ! Thank you ! Do you think he'd like her ? I'd bet that she's married. Trust me ! I'm in charge now ! Oh, Manuelle ! What are you doing here ? Hello, you ! Ivan... My friend Isabelle. Hello ! And here's my little Gilbert, very quiet! Aren't you, my friend ? So... tell me... You've got plans ? I'm starting a movie in Italy in a few days. I'm here between two movies. Between two loves. So you're free... - Free as a bird. You've known Isabelle long ? Since last year. Her brother was in love with me in Switzerland. Do you remember ? You remember what fun we had, the three of us... You like funny people ? I do, yes. I know this guy, he is hung up, he is disturbing and above that, he is very wealthy. Hmm Maria ! It smells so good ! I must be dreaming. Is that all ? Paella is very filling. Ah... of course... If more of them come every five minutes ! Those are staying too ? Yes, Maria, I think so ! Champagne ! - Champagne for everyone ! Glasses ! They're staying, Maria ! No doubt ! When there's enough for 3, there's enough for 6. The telephone arrives up there. And your room will look down here. See ? Ah here it is ! - Champagne ! Good soup... No, no I always open the champagne bottles. I'll introduce Monica to you. Well... I do find her plain ! She has that rocker look... Quite exciting ! Come on, children ! Quick ! The soup is served ! - I love champagne ! - Good soup ! There ! Ah... you're the writer ? I do indeed ! - Let's forget it ! Take this ... from your little rocker ! Your eyes are bright, bright as spirit ! Aren't they ? Champagne and compliments make my head spin ! I love wounds, broken hearts... especially mine ! - You're not cheerful. - I couldn't. I'm in love ! Already ! There's the... or not. My first... I was 8. I had to force-feed her with carousel rides and sweets to be able to kiss her. Since then the sports car have replaced the wooden horses, the late dinners the sweets. Yes... Dolce vita, scotch and vodka. Are you tempted ? Not at all ! Definitely not ! Hello ? Mr. Klaus ? I'm sorry to disturb you, Sir but a young man told me about you. He even gave your name as a reference. As a reference, yes ! Move, will you ? Since morning, you've been as still as a mummy. I'm taking your "Nefertiti" I feel melancholic. It's because of your liver ! Eponym ? The Athenian archon who gave his name to the particular year he served in. You're naked ! So what ? You want to change my mood ? Oh... the state you're in... I could do anything.... When you don't have your head round this... you don't have your head round this ! What can be done ? Well... throw me my cigarettes... They don't do it better at the "Crazy Horse" You're sighing ? Yes... out of admiration. For me ? For me. Anyone else in my place would have leapt like a famished tiger. I haven't. What a man ! Eric ! A wasp ! I was stung ! What ? - A wasp ! Are you sure ? What do you mean : am I sure ? It hurts very badly. There ! You're sure there's nothing ? You think so ? I'm not bad looking. I even have a fine chest. Haven't I ? Well... it's of no importance. They only want one thing : getting money, else they feel frustrated... Can you look into the sun ? When I think that some only have to do that to get a girl. Let me ! Let me ! To me... money.... You know... when I like something... or someone, I stay. Else, I go. That's it ! And do you like me ? I never say yes, or no or maybe. Eric is not down yet ? No, we haven't seen him. What about our "petanque" ? They're making love ? Oh, you do sound licentious, my boy! You can't understand. It's too subtle for you. Oh, did you hear that ? Would you like me if I were... Chinese ? And ?... And... and a Negro woman ? And what if... if I were ugly ? You find me beautiful ? Say it ! Why ? Aren't you sure of it ? All women think they're ugly. Even beautiful women ? Especially beautiful women. You're a philosopher. And you are quite silent. You're miserly with words. What do you want me to tell you ? Tell me you love me. Oh, you want big words... Monica... You won't say it, will you ? Come on down ! Time for a game of "p?tanque" ! Let's go ! You'd better come play p?tanque ! "P?tanque" time ! - Oh yes ! Let's ! No... we risk meeting the garage owner. No, stay here ! Well...We shall stay here ! You're not funny ! Yet, in our times... - women are free. Check over. No need, Mr. Klaus... We do agree ? - Absolutely. By the way... It's no use telling that... that Ivan that I settled that little thing. Right ? Understood ? - Yes, Sir. I'll take care of it myself. I understand, Mr. Klaus. Thank you. You've been straight. I count on you. You forgot it all. Besides... nothing ever happened. Nothing. Nothing at all, Mr. Klaus. Goodbye, Mr. Klaus. I've got the informations. Our little... lady-killer is at the house. His friends are here, playing "p?tanque". Your go ! I shoot it ! May I bite into your ear lobe ? - Are you tempted ? I am indeed ! Please do ! Watch out ! He's going to shoot ! Hey, friend ! Petanque is not like life. You've got to think ! You shoot or you aim ? Well... I don't give a damn ! Petanque is serious, isn't it ? What if I'm not serious ? Damn petanque ! Damn it all ! And shit to you ! That's it ! She's gone ! You can't play with women. I told you, guys ! Excuse me... The road to Sant Vicens please ? Ah, you're not on the good road. You turn right down there... You turn round, go back and the road is on your left. You take this one out. We score 4 points 11 plus 4, 15. We win ! All right. I'll try it ! Didn't I tell you ? So we've got to kiss that woman's behind ! You do, Miss ! That's it ! Your go ! Take the small one. - Thank you ! Here's to you ! Well... I'm through ! - What about that return game ? - He's the one with the car ! We're not going to walk those 4 kilometers. Tomorrow ! We'll play tomorrow ! Let's go ! Good bye ! You're beautiful ! I mean it ! Clever, distinguished. Be quiet ! She can't hear us ! You're fed up with her ? You like that ? No. This is for old men. Your horrible animal must be flea-ridden. And how come I never have fleas then ? What were you saying ? I have that expression... - Which one ? Woman regenerates man. What about Manuelle ? Does she... regenerate you ? No, not at all. But... you could... Don't bother ! She doesn't realize... You know... You get all the women you want. But you ! Try ! Careful ! She can't see anything. She goes through life on a cloud. You've got soft fingers. Of her, I can do anything I want... Good for you ! Pick up my polo shirt ! - Not a chance ! A fine tamer's job ! That was smart ! Come back ! Too late ! I love cars ! They're closed universes, always ready to leave for somewhere else. Why somewhere else ? You don't like it here ? One never really likes it where he is. Aim the heart. Crazy about her ? - Seems like it ! What about her ? Isabelle ? - I don't know ! Haze and mist... What you like. You must appreciate. Allah be praised ! What's so funny ? We are. We like each other. Indeed ! What shall we do ? We notice. Of course, I like animals ! Dogs too ? Dogs too, yes ! I don't know what came into me. Because... my life is not a bed of roses. A difficult situation, money problems... All those things... Not really pleasant. Isn't it nice here ? We can't stay. The garage owner can find us any time. Look ! Isn't he cute? Yeah ! We go back to the others ? No desire ? What if... What if ? Heads, we go ! Tails, we stay ! Go where ? Elsewhere. One month... one day... one year. Heads ! We're leaving ! And what shall we do at the end of the trip ? You'll never guess ! Love ! Descartes ! I leave therefore I have sex. In love, the same rails always take to the same stations. I don't like rails at all... I like the unexpected better. So ? So... heads, we have sex... tails... brother and sister... Shall I ? Heads ! Heads ! Tails ! Brother and sister ! What's your game? Knowing if we leave or not ! We can always go sailing ! To hell with Isabelle. - To hell ! To hell with ?ric ! - To hell ! I'm bored ! To hell with love ! To hell ! To hell with alcohol ! What's happening to you ? What's wrong with you ? You don't want to answer either ? What's going on ? It's really a disease ! Do you like this ? How awful ! You want to play cards ? It doesn't affect you ? ?ric, Isabelle ? ?ric is free. So am I. He's had affairs. So have I. It has no importance. It's wonderful ! It would make me crazy ! Is Ivan your first love ? Yes. But that's not the point. To me, love is like a fortress. You surround it with barbed wire and... Oh...More alcohol ! Look ! a gun ! We shoot all those who want to come near us. Oh... What about offering her a car ? Too commonplace ! Commonplace ! A car ! Bloody hell ! Commonplace, I say ! - Marry her then ! Dull ! Ivan ! You're wanted on the phone ! You're a real champion but now, you stop it ! Hello ? - Hello, Ivan ! Speaking. I know all about your problems. What problems ? With the garage owner. You do ?... Well... Be at the Sant Vicens crossroads in half an hour. But who's speaking ? In half an hour. Your foot , there ! Listen ! even if... Ouch ! Listen... You made my foot crack ! Try with this one ! - Wait ! I'll start with that one ! Push ! It hurts too much ! I don't like suffering. 300 000 francs ! What is it to you ? For me, it changes.. everything ! I finish off that thing and that's it ! Love... What does it mean ? You open your arms on a smile, close them down on a ghost ! Women ! Do something ! It's getting horrendous ! They love stroking your skin, don't they ? Your soft, young girl's skin. Will you help me or not ? Tell me the truth... You find women beautiful ? They're tampered with. They smell like rubber. Rubber ? - Yes, girdles, stockings... suspender belts... They're dolls adorned with rubber. And child birth ! That bloody rite ! My dear... they should lay... eggs. Eggs ! You're crazy ! What respect would I have for my mother if I knew she'd laid an egg ? What ? You've got respect for your mother ? You... I see ! She's suffering ! She was never out of her council flat ? She hasn't got any money ! Just like you ! She's dead. What's going on ? You've not left yet ? What about your going away ? Not packed your bags yet ? What going away ? Those two ! Better and better ! He didn't say anything to you? Listen ! ... About... - You're overreacting. - Of course, I do. Come on, sweetie... You don't want me to run, do you ? That's wonderful ! You don't mind a quarrel but with comfort ! I don't want a quarrel ! At last ! You won't run very far on those heels ! And not barefoot either ! You dramatize everything ! - Indeed ! Until now, you used to treat these small affairs with more humor ! as for me... when the same happened to you... You behaved with perfect elegance. Never one look ! Never any reproach, never ! I'm tired ! Let's go back ! - You fool ! I'm tired of living in this way. In the past, slaves would rebel to be free ; today women rebel to become slaves. Stop ! Let's go back ! - No. You're nothing but a helot ! Ah ! Ah ! I knew that you'd look for the meaning. You feel better, it seems. Don't you ? It looks as if you're feeling better. What ? What do you want from me ? Who are you ? A man who wishes you good. A man who wishes you good. A man who wishes you good. You are the man who phoned me ? What ? Where are we going ? Stop ! I want to go out! He wants to go out. Get out. Impressive, isn't it ? What ? And no one around. The wind carries the sounds towards the open sea. I don't understand , What are you up to ? You're in a real mess, kid ! Sex with an underage girl ! If I wanted to, you'd be in jail tomorrow. So you'll listen to me and do as I say. Without trying to understand or asking questions. You wouldn't be trying to impress me, would you ? You'll go back to the house, quarrel with Manuelle and pack your bags. Just tell her you don't love her any more, that you've never loved her. And you'll vanish without leaving an address. Understood ? - No ! It's quite simple though. If the police comes to take Manuelle back home, she'll imagine she's found true love, that she is Juliet whose Romeo is torn away from her. And she'll try to see you again. If you abandon her... she'll cry for a month, then she'll forget it all. Who sent you ? - I said : no questions. Her father ? We do agree, don't we ? I imagine you first want to save your skin. As everyone else. Is it a threat ? - A piece of advice. But you can consider it's the same thing. You don't know who you're dealing with, do you ? Ivan ! I'm scared. I don't understand anything. Don't leave me alone so often ! Stop that nonsense ! Nonsense... of course ! Stop crying, will you? I'm scared all the time. Of what ? Everything is so strange. I don't know what I must say, what I must do. I'm scared because I love you too much. I always laugh because of stupid things. I always say stupid things. But it's not my fault. I've always been scared. I've always been left alone. What about your father ? You don't trust him ? He's always kept me apart. Out of his life. Actually, I don't know him. What's he like ? Both good and cruel. Strange. I mean... physically. Oh... Chubby ! With small eyes. He doesn't wear glasses, does he ? Yes, he does. Why ? You told me he is very wealthy. What does he do ? He's in business. Of what sort ? - I don't know. He stopped working 10 years ago. We never talk about it, in fact. It doesn't seem strange to you ? - Why ? - No reason. You'll never leave me alone, will you ? Why are you saying this ? No reason. You could have told me that you were her father. I would have shown more respect. Did you speak to her ? No. I can be tactful when necessary. Have you left her ? Vanish ! Vanish ! Easy to say. Only... I'm in trouble. What sort of trouble ? Money trouble. If I had time, I would find a way. At once... no warning... In my time... You made pastis cloudy by pouring water on a sugar lump, set on a spoon above the glass. But everything die these days, customs, traditions... What ? I'm quite willing to do you a favor. but you must help me. Youth ! Foolhardy youth ! In your opinion, what species of gulls are on the boat over there ? Some seagull. It's a herring gull. Another mistake. What were you saying ? I don't understand why you're so mysterious. Or rather I think I understand. Besides I'm really willing to do you a favor. How much ? 600. Tomorrow morning, here. At 9. Time for me to find some cash. All right. Who told you ? Only Manuelle does not realize anything. Don't worry. I prefer gangsters to cops. See you tomorrow. Shall I go ? Don't. He's been seen coming in. You gave up 300 at the garage, now he wants 600... He'll soon ask for a yacht ! He won't ask for anything. You're dreaming. That little bastard has got cheek! I've always avoided real blows. No blood on my hands. It's been 10 years since I stopped. I thought I was safe from that. Honorable bourgeois. Good father. I thought Manuelle would never know. She had to meet him. I had sent her to boarding-school to avoid that sort of situation. You won't pay, will you ? I'll bend the rules I'd set. It will be the first time. What I never did for money... I'll do for her. You want me to take care of it ? No... I'll do it myself. It's the night of fragile happiness, of threatened unions. The false loves die at dawn. The ridiculous lovers hide. And in a while, when I have spinned my web... our dear ?ric will be glad to have the night in the park to hide from Isabelle's gaze. You're a true Machiavel. Machiavel used to say : divide to rule. Let's get to work. I pity you, poor girl. You're too kind. What I mean... is that I admire you. That harem thing... ?ric is good ! It is true that it is of no consequence. You remain the first favorite. He's been drinking or what ? No, he thinks he is Machiavel. So, Verlaine tells Rimbaud... if you're not busy on Sunday, we'll go see Totor. Totor ? - Well... Hugo. You've never read the letters Hugo and Juliette Drouet wrote each other ? No. - Well, it's very funny The laundry invoices, go the laundry, my big totor... there's food waiting for you. Well, let's forget it. So the next sunday, he takes him to Hugo's. The old man is waiting for them... He's sitting in his big armchair. Rimbaud is very impressed. And Hugo, peer of France and all that... He bows to him. He says "Good day, Sir." And Hugo says : oh, he is very young. And Rimbaud says : yes sir, I'm sixteen. Hugo stands up, puts his hand on his brow. He says : you're the ascending generation, I'm the descending generation. Then Rimbaud looks at Verlaine and says : The old guy talks rubbish ! That cocktail is wonderful ! Wonderful ! Oh... sorry ! Tell me... - You want to finish it ? No. Tell me... Who's Machiavel ? A very complicated guy. You remember ? Proust... The Vinteuil sonata as we had imagined it. You had composed it for me. No... For Gilberte Swann. It was I. You were wild, uncompromising. You admitted nothing, demanded everything. Like Gilberte Swann. Then... Then Gilberte Swann accepted life. And she became a whore. Jean-Claude... I'm very much changed. Very much. For good ? You've become more ...tolerant. Are you afraid to face the truth ? Cheers ! To your health ! Come ! No, I don't feel like it. Don't play the distant princess. Now... Take Napoleon... Do you know how Napoleon would prepare his campaigns when he was a general ? No ! - You don't know ?... Well... He made the other generals come one after the other and told them : Pal, that's it. I'm starting again. The guy would say : Well that will be like last time. Napoleon said to him : Well, I'm ready to have you back. I've decided to put you in charge of the 10th Army... and I'll give you one million. When he said so, big protests. What ? One million ? I already got paid that last time. Since then, I have become famous. I want three million. It made Napoleon speak in his Corsican accent : Tri millione, yoo want eet all ? you're keeling me. Too millione. Three said the other one and so on... Well, just like the movie stars. As you will be one day... -I will never be a star. ?ric does not love you. ?ric doesn't love you ?ric does not love you. Give me something to drink. You haven't had enough ? - Not enough yet. I hate you, bastard ! You bastard ! Bastard ! I hate you ! You made fun of me ! I hate you ! I hate you ! You lost your head ! You're crazy ! Nothing but a game ! She wanted to make ?ric jealous and... You're sure ? Sure ? You'll see : we'll live fine things together. I'll take you to Italy. The crude sky, the ochre houses. Isabelle ! Isabelle ! Ah it's you ! - She's gone ! Isabelle ? With ?ric. They're gone. For good ? - I don't know. I think so. So Monica is alone in her room. You ! It's daylight. ?ric does not love you ! ?ric does not love you ! Where are your dresses ? - Down there. You're crazy ! What are you doing ? You're leaving ! You're leaving with me ! Listen, Ivan. Your love is very fine but at times, it's really annoying. I'd rather see you annoyed than humiliated. Do you intend to spend all your nights waiting ? A woman like you ! A woman like me ! I'm fed up hearing this. Hear me ? I am capable of great things for you. Even work ! ?ric wasn't able to understand you. He's too skeptical... Love drives crazy. Have you ever seen ?ric crazy ? Ivan ! You love me so much ! Feeling all right ? - No. Don't bother ! What do you mean ? That it's over ! Already over ! Why ? We like each other. I love you, maybe. We could have. But we didn't really believe in it. Isabelle ! Where have you been ? I want a smoke. I want that one. Everything can be done to you. I had sex with ?ric... on the beach, sprawled on the sand. Everything can be said to you. What will you do now ? I'll make money ! What's your game ? As you can see, I'm leaving. Back to Paris ? Not at all. I'm leaving with Ivan. No, you don't mean it. - Why ? He loves me. I can't even touch you ! What about Isabelle then ? What does it matter? - It doesn't. Let's not talk about it then. - It would be better, indeed. You're jealous ! You're losing your mind, aren't you ? You're suffering ? Is it a sudden discovery ? It's silly, my chickadee. Sin is everything that's useless. And useless suffering is the worst of all sins. Talk ! Talk ! - Try to understand things ! No, I want to be silly. I want to be loved, and be told about it all the time. MONICA, I LOVE YOU. Say it to me again. What will it be like in Italy ? No, not now. - Yes, tell me. The crude sky, the ochre houses... We're going through life as on a gondola filled with flowers, a song. Where are you going ? Monica ! - What are you talking about ? Let go of me ! I lied to you. It's Monica whom I love. I want to leave with her, start everything from scratch. You forgive me ?
