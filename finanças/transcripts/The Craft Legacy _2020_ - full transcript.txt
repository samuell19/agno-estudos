- Today's the day. - All right. - I feel good about this one. - Us three witches are fire. I don't know why we keep trying without a fourth. Oh, here she goes. - What? It's been two years. - Maybe we don't need a fourth. You need all four. - Each Crescent is an element. See? - Okay. North, south, east, west. I wanna freeze time. We couldn't even freeze time if we had a fourth. - I have it on the table, Frankie. - Hold it, or you'll light something up. - It's already on fire. - All right. I love this plate. - All right. - Don't put it out. I have to. We have to start the ritual. Your feather. Frankie, watch out. You're always lighting things on fire, bro. - Not this time. - Y'all witches ready? As the night receives your light and the oceans feel your pull, I set my intention to grow with you, from new to full. I summon the spirits of the north, spirit of earth and body, spirit of dirt. Blessed be. I summon the spirits of the east, spirit of air, spirit of new beginnings, spirit of breath. Blessed be. I summon the spirits of the south, spirit of fire and will, spirit of heat. Blessed be. Tabby, can you just pretend you didn't summon the Southern spirits and do the spirits of the west? What? No. That's wack. I already did mine. Well, someone needs to. It's not gonna work otherwise. If we're gonna be honest, the spirits of the west have been messing shit up for a while now, so why don't we just leave them out? She's got a valid point. And, look, anyways, it starts with east. - East, south, west... - Okay. See, this is why we can only do basic magic. We've never had a fourth. How many times have we tried to telepathically communicate? Oh, my god! You're obsessed with telepathically communicating! Read the book. "So it shall be sealed and done when all four corners meet as one." Wait, wait, wait. - Oh, shit! - Oh, shit! It's your jam. Okay, here we go. Yes! Shit. You know the words. Sorry. Oh, baby. Oh, no, no, no. You can cry. All right, get it out. Oh, honey, I'm... I get it, man. This is... This is weird though, isn't it? We're having all the feels. I'm dying. Okay, you're gonna do my makeup when we get there. - Okay. - This is... - I got you. - Okay. - But... - Turn it back up, please. - How are my brows? - They look great. Okay. Okay. - You look beautiful. - Oh, gosh. You do. Okay. I do. - You ready? - I'm nervous. - Yeah. Yeah. - Okay. Okay. Shit. All right, let's do this. Okay. Hello. Eee Sam serst - hi. - I see you made it in one piece. Yeah, it's... oh, god. Is that another piece of you I see right here? Hi, Lily. Finally got you here. It's nice to see you again. Last time was on your turf though, so now it's my home-court advantage. That's a sports metaphor. - A metaphor, an analogy. - Oh, yeah. I get it. - Yeah, I get it. - Dad joke. Guilty. - That's a cool camera. - Thanks. - It is, isn't it? - Let's take a picture. - You know? Commemorate the moment. - That's a great idea. - Yeah. May 1? - Okay. - It's not really a selfie thing but here. - Sure. How do I...? - Just... - Wow, analog. Dig it. Old school. Ready? All right. Come on in, meet the boys. They're excited to meet you. Yes. I think they even bathed. Oh, okay. - This is Isaiah. - Hey. - Jacob. - Hi. And Abe. Hi. - What the hell? - Hey, give Lily the good seat. - Move over. - Move. - Isaiah, just move over! - Cut it out, hey! Move. Settle down. A little birdie told me mint chip was your favorite. - Thanks. - Isn't that right, little birdie? My beautiful, little birdie. That's gross, dad. Ee er ee = ee = =e zee = nice digs. You okay? Yeah. How you feeling about school tomorrow? Are you excited? You can make new friends. Well, that would imply that I had old friends. There's gonna be d-bags no matter where you go, right? Mom. It's not nice. - Sorry. - It's douchebags. Douchebags? I was going for dickbags. All right. Just remember what I always tell you. Your difference is your power. - Okay, on that note, I'm gonna go unpack. - Okay. - Love you. - Love you. Hey. Thank you for just being so cool... - Mom. - About all of this. - I know it feels fast. - Mom, I'm not judging you at all. I just have not connected to someone like this for so long, and, god, it just feels really good, like, you know, to have someone to... I get it. - All right, baby, get some rest. - Okay. - Love you. - I love you. - Love you, love you, love you. - Love you, love you. What's up? Nice kicks. Thanks, yo. Have a good first day. Thanks. I know why the caged bird sings, ah me, when his wing is bruised and his bosom sore... When he beats his bars and he would be free; but a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core, but a plea, that upward to heaven he flings... I know why the caged bird sings! Okay, this week we're gonna be reading chapters one through four of Maya angelou's seminal autobiography, which draws its title... God, are you seeing this? - Timmy. - I'm sorry. - Okay, what's going on? - Hey. Hi. I think you dropped something. Oh, my goodness. - It's super gnarly. - Can we settle down back there, please? Let's go. - Jacob. - It's like a crime scene or something. Hey, hey. All right, enough. Settle down. Hello? I think she's in here. Hello? Listen, it happens to everyone. Timmy's just a dick. Seriously, don't waste your tears on him. I mean, you're not alone. He's made us all cry at one point or another. Also, girl, your flow is heavy and that is something to celebrate. - Frankie. Frankie, bro. - What? I'm just saying. Aunt flo's in from the redlands. We brought you some shorts. I wore them in gym, so they're sweaty, but they should fit you. Okay. Okay, I'll just slide them under the door. Thank you. You can sit with us if you want. Not that anybody really wants to sit with us anyways. Thanks, guys. - Oh, my god. Did he just look at you? - Down, girl. Frankie's been in love with Jacob since the fifth grade. What? No, no. No. - No. - He's kind of my brother. - Come a who? - Stepbrother. Or soon-to-be stepbrother. Sorry, I have really bad cramps. - Been there. - Same. Can't relate but sorry. What? Hey, we should hang out after school this week. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Mom? Hello? (Get out! Oh, god. - You want a sip? - Sure. - Mom! - You know I can't control myself. That's very good. Okay, okay. Show me your dance moves. Oh, my gosh. That's so sweet. Hey. What's all that? I just had to go through some paperwork for your new school, but you know me. I put all the important shit in a shoebox, and it makes it impossible to find. Adam says he's gonna get me organized, so I'm taking it down to the office. But I told him not to get his hopes up, so... Hey, thanks for washing my jeans, by the way. What jeans? - The ones I bled through today. - I didn't. Maybe it was Adam. Look who it is. Just in time for first period. - Timmy. - You know what helps with cramps? Sex. That was, like, insane. Both of you, principal's office now! Lily. “What? Miss schechner, who are you speaking to? - Didn't you just call my name? - No. If you can hear this, you're our fourth. Go to the bathroom. - Yes? - Can I go to the bathroom? Sure. Make it quick. Take your stuff. - You need your backpack? - You didn't get the memo? She's on the rag. My bad. That's good. Double detention. - Anything else? - For what? Oh, shit! I told y'all haters she was the fourth! Yes, yes, y'all! It's the mother fricking reckoning! I can't even believe this. - We on another level. - What the hell, you guys? We sent you a message telepathically. Yeah. Telepathically communicating with you. Nbd. Jk. It's, like, a vbd for sure because now you're actually here and we on some shit. Okay. Can somebody translate? Okay. It was a test to see if your antennas were up. - And they up! - Way up. - They up! - What do you mean? How? Well, we practiced a lot of times, but we never got it quite right. But, I mean, today, it was like... Super tampon to the rescue! That's you. Sorry, is it too soon? - So how long have you been practicing? - Practicing? Yeah. Oh, no, I never, like, practiced anything before. Okay, so, like, when did you start getting a sense of your gift? What are you guys talking about? - What? - We're witches. Take my hand. It's okay. Come with me. We're gonna learn a lot today. - You're witches? - Yep. And you're a witch too! - Sorry, this is all a little new to me. - I mean, it's new to us too. - We've never thrown a grown-ass man. - That was so wild! Yeah, and, like, we all thought it at the same time. Wait, what? Tell me you didn't think about throwing his ass off of you. - Yeah, I did. - Well, so did we! And then, bam! And that's just stage one, moving stuff with our minds. Or people, I guess, in Timmy's case. - If he even counts as a person. - True that. - Anything. - Stage two? That's what went down in detention. That was so sick! And you said we couldn't do it. Stage three, we'll get to soon enough. Let's surprise her though. Stage four, shape-shifting. Shape-shifting. You know, the power to take on a different form? And if we get to stage four, I'm low-key turning myself into Kristen Stewart. Don't judge. She's a twilight Stan. Point is, we've never made it past stage one. - Never. - And then in walks Robert pattinson. Bro! “What? You tell me she's not giving off Edward Cullen vibes right now. I'm sorry, can you guys just slow down? I'm having a hard time catching up. Okay, well, why don't you tell us a little about you. Yeah, like, what's your ancestry? I don't really know. I've never looked into it before. What about your mom? Is she a witch? She's a therapist from New Jersey. It's gotta come from somewhere. Yeah, you see, we've been looking for our fourth for a while now. We thought we could form a coven, just us three... It doesn't work like that. No, because we each have an element that corresponds to a direction. I'm fire. - Alr. - Earth. So you've got north, south, east... But west, that was a tough get. And now you're here. You're water. You're west. Yeah, in order for us to have, like, maximum power, we all need to be on our directions. - The term is "calling the corners." - Okay. This is a lot, but I am listening and also working through a low-level panic attack. Okay, we know that this is probably a lot to take in right now. But you shouldn't run from your power. None of us should. That's what my mom always says. "Your difference is your power." - Oh, then mom's cool. - So, what do you say? - Lily. - Oh, my god, Frankie. Give me your hand. Come on. Will you be our fourth? Come on, I got bad knees. Her acls are gonna tear. You had me at shape-shifting into Kristen Stewart. - She said yes! She said yes. - Oh, my god. - Why didn't you say yes originally? - Let's go. I mean, witchcraft in general is such a charged word. We literally house babies in our stomachs. That's some Ridley Scott shit. We have superpowers without even trying. - I mean, not all of us can do that, but... - Shit. Point taken. My bad, Lou. It's all good. Y'all know trans girls got our own magic anyway. Word. They do, they do. That's why covens have always been so important. Because half the battle of having powers is believing you do. What are we doing? Well, now that we got our fourth, we need to take our coven for a test drive. So whenever we do a spell, we always cast a circle first. Think of it as, you know, making a container to hold all of our energies. And to keep the bad shit out. Breathe. Listen to the sound of the trees breathing along with you. Feel yourself rooted into the ground and into this moment. We transcend time. We suspend fate. We bear the three keys. Oh, shit. We open the triple gate. We open the triple gate. The air, the fire, the water, the earth. Return, return, return. The air, the fire, the water, the earth. Return, return, return. Guys. Holy shit! That was so fricking cool! “What? That was crazy though! Never? - Yo! No, no, no. - That's stage three, baby. Okay, but if we could do that, now what should we do? - Why are we at Timmy's house? - He's a terrorist. That's a little extreme. - We don't wanna hurt him though, right? - Why not? No, she's right. Hexing, it's serious. So is harassment. Everybody relax. We're not hexing him. We'll just cast a spell to make him less of a garbage person. How do you know no one's home? - Bull's-eye. - Come on. Oh, my god. I'll take the lead on this one. I can wing it. You guys, we shouldn't be doing this. Okay, we need something from his physical person to cast the spell. Twist. - What? - No way. No way. - Timmy full of surprises. - Nah, this boy has a ouija board? Guys? I think I found something from his physical person. - Oh, no. - Oh, no way. No, no, no. That is not a used... Low-key kind of surprised he used a condom. Frankie, don't touch that! Come on, it's... It's definitely his most powerful element. I hate to give it to her, but Frankie's kind of right, guys. This is so gross. - Okay. We need a caldron. - Okay. What? Bong. - Okay. Ready? - Okay, what do I do? Rose oil. Hurl. I'm gonna hurl. Don't let it touch you, bro. Don't let it touch you, bro. Don't! Frankie. Bro. - Angelica. Rose quartz. - Okay. We call upon the goddess of holy mysteries. - You're doing it. - In spirit and in body and in perfect love and perfect trust, may we awaken Timmy to his highest self. From this day forth. Blessed be. - Do it, girl. - Do it. - Get it. - Get it on that pillow. - Gross! - Do it. - Timmy? - Shit, guys. - Shit! - Oh, my god. Shit! Go! “What do we do? We gotta jump. We gotta jump. - There's a clear shot out this window. - We're on the second story. It's our only option. Come on. Can't you guys just make us fly or something? Bitch, no! Timmy, no video games until you finish your homework. Yeah, I know, dad. Lily! Come on! Run! Yes! She taught us all to read auras. Blessed be thy sight. The maiden, the mother, the crone. - 'Sup, bitch? - I'm sorry. What are you gonna do about it? What are you gonna do? = = se - water. - Earth. = _- - water. - Earth. - Lily. I was starting to get worried. - Hey. Yeah, sorry, I was just hanging out with my friends. Friends? Yes. Radical, I know. Hey, Helen, is Lily up there with you? Listen, sweetie, we gotta talk about something. I get back from a week away doing groups and Jacob tells me you assaulted Timmy Andrews? - No, I was defending myself. - He said Timmy didn't lay a hand on you. - He whispered something in my ear... - He whispered something so you hit him? If you'd just let me finish... When I am speaking, please don't interrupt me. - Okay. - Thank you. Mom, please... Adam, let's take a step back here for a second, all right? She was defending herself. Well, I'm sure the circumstances were complicated, but... You know, with my boys, I have to have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to violence. That's the way it's always been in this house, so... More than anything, I'm disappointed, Lily, in you. Really disappointed in you. - Way to stick it to the man, mom. - Lily. You just need to be more kind in the way that you speak to her. - Kind? - Yesl! - Discipline, it's all about kindness. - That's not what I meant. She has an attitude, Helen. She comes in here all holier-than-thou. - It's uncomfortable for everyone. - It's complicated for her! Hey. Sorry. - What are you doing out here? - I just like to come here to think. Get away from the noise. You know? Yeah. Listen, my dad can be strict, but he does it out of love. You know? He always says, "power equals order." I mean, there's a reason why he's gotten to where he has. People travel from all over the world to hear him speak about this kind of stuff. Right. So, what about your dad? I've never met him. I don't even know his hame. So you two wanna have sex. Let's talk ground rules. Number one, consent. At any moment, it is your right to say stop. Sure, if you wanna give him blue balls. - Hey, Jeremy. - I'm sorry. Consent is defined as an affirmative, unambiguous and involuntary agreement. So yes, and only yes, means yes. Yes, yes, yes! Oh, my god, shut up, Jeremy. - Thank you, Timmy. - I'm sorry. It's super inappropriate. Can you send him to the principal's office already? I mean, he's making so many people here uncomfortable. Give me a break. I was joking. No, it can trigger a lot of shit for people, okay? So why don't you just try being a little bit more sensitive and just... Just listen. Okay? Whatever. Yo, he called himself cisgendered in seventh period today. Turn to me. Girl. In eighth period, he went on a tear about heteronormativity. Oh, my god, tabs. I love that nail. That's fire. Yeah. - Oh, snap! - Hey, listen. We don't know for sure that this Timmy stuff is because of us. But all the signs point to "it definitely is." Well, we'll certainly see at his party tonight. Scene of the crime. - Okay, we need to proceed with caution. - Agreed. These kinds of spells are no joke. When it comes to Timmy, we need to talk through everything we do, how we do it and when, okay? Lily? You got all that? Yeah. Yeah. All right, well, enough with the melo. Picture time! Okay. Work, witches. Yeah, so anyways... oh, my god. Hey, Shelly. You know my favorite kind of movie? Period pieces. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Tampons are in the medicine cabinet. It's super cool to shame other girls. You're the best! It's so sad that you, like, try to look pretty. Careful. Words hurt. Bye. “What the heck? Oh, my god. No, I'm fine. Honestly, I'm fine. Hey. You looking for the bathroom? There's one just down the hall. I mean, there's one in there, but it seems otherwise occupied. Right. Lily... I think I owe you an apology. The other day, I was... What's the word I'm looking for? An asshole? Yeah. Yeah, no, that's... That's the word. I guess it has to do with power and me shaming you around something that's already pretty vulnerable, so... I guess what I'm trying to say is... Sorlty. Hey. You good? Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. Look, I'm not drinking tonight, but if you really wanna party, I've got this secret stash of lacroix in the fridge downstairs. I also compiled this super eclectic playlist, and I'm open to any requests. I think more than anything, tonight I really just wanna dance. Yeah. All right. Sorry. I'll scoot by. I'm just gonna go ahead and say it. I'm really into woke Timmy. What about proceeding with caution? Lily's right. We have to be really careful. - We've never used a dude's... - Okay, don't. You don't have to remind me. Oh, snap. Oh, he's playing Princess Nokia. Bye! I mean, I just love her politics, you know? - Totally. - Just the way she uses her artistry to deal with race politics and gender politics and still just makes, like, the sickest pop jams. I read this interview with Janet mock... Oh, let me get you a glass. Chivalrous. The bar is that low, huh? - There you go. Of course. - Thank you. Hey, I like your necklace. What's that symbol? I don't know. My mom gave it to me when I was little. It's dope. My mom gave me a necklace too. Guess it's a thing, you know? Moms and necklaces. I used to think it was kind of wack, but... Yeah, I don't know. It's a nice thing, ever since she died, to just remember her by. When did she...? When I was 11. I'm sorry. No. It's fine. Can I tell you something kind of embarrassing? Sure. I still... I still talk to her. Or try to. I know that's kind of woo-woo0 or whatever, but I have this ouija board from when I was a kid, and I use it sometimes to try... And reach out, I guess. - I don't think that's embarrassing at all. - Okay. I mean, if I'd lost my mom, I'd do the same thing. Has it worked? Yeah. - Yeah. - What did she say? She told me to clean my room. - No. - Yeah. Like, she really did. That must've taken a really long time to spell out on a ouija board. It was definitely a good five minutes or something like that. A lot. Guys. Lily, you need to come right now. - Yeah! - It's a party. Yeah. Okay. Yes yes. Do it. Yo, dude, we need to talk about our science project. - Are you coming to eat with us or what? - Yeah. Yeah. I'll catch you guys later? Girls. Women. Yeah. No, women with an x. All right. - We're told that this is... - I got next. Don't touch that. Isaiah. - What the shit? - You still staying for dinner? Yeah, I mean, if it's cool with you. Yeah. It's cool. Yo, I'm going out. - Let's go upstairs. - Okay. Wait, let's all hang together. Yeah? I mean... - Sure. - Jacob? We can do this stuff in an hour. Let's just hang out with the girls. - Yeah, no, I'm good. You go ahead. - Wait, you sure? Yup. Suit yourself, dude. Let's go. Come on! So you've really never played two truths, one lie before? No. Well, get ready. Are you sure we shouldn't check with Jacob, like, one more time? - Clean your room. - Maybe he wants to hang out. - Maybe he changed his mind. - Okay, who wants to go first? And then, like, maybe we could make this a spin the bottle situation. - Jesus. - Oh, my god. - I'll go first. I'll go first. - Thank you. Okay, I wish I had more black friends. I am scared for my brother's safety every day. And I don't like Beyonce. Okay, someone else. You didn't let us guess. - I said three truths. - Wait, you don't like Beyoncé? No, bitch. I love her. I'll go. So my mom gave me this. And I'm a virgin. What? - Lie! - What the hell, man? That's a lie. You don't know. Yeah, I know. You don't know. - You don't know. - Shut up, bro. And... Isaiah and I hooked up. Wait. Shit. - I'm sorry. I don't know why... - It's okay. You can talk to us. Well... It was... I'm sorry, I just... I've never told anyone this before. And... It's like... Jacob's my best friend. And he would... Have you and Isaiah ever talked about it? You kidding me? He won't even look at me since it happened. Shit. I'm sorry. It's just... It's felt good when it's been with girls as well, so... Oh, god. I don't know. It's just hard for dudes. I feel like there's no room to be... Everyone just assumes you're just gay, and that's fine. You know, there's nothing wrong with that at all. I... I just... I like both. You know? Hello? Oh, shit. You guys gotta leave. - Wait, what? - I'm sorry. - He's gonna kill us if he hears us. - Okay. Over there, over there. Look, I'll go distract him. Okay? Isaiah told you he's not coming home for dinner? - Yeah, he went out. I don't know. - He what? Yeah, he went out. Dad, how was your trip? It was good. It was real good. Thanks for asking. Made some real breakthroughs in some of my groups. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Like what? There's a lot of pain for these men living just under the surface, especially now. I'll get the chicken. - Here, let me help. - It's fine. No, I want to. Fine. Thank you. As this garment glows in light, I draw you closer to me this night. Hi, I was just wondering if I left my sweatshirt in here. No. No, I don't think so. Are you...? Were you going to bed? It's only, like, 8:00. No, I'm... I'm meditating. Oh, shit. Yeah. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. No. No, it's cool. You take these? Yeah. They're amazing. Thanks. Listen... I just wanna say... Thank you. For today. I... I just feel like a massive... Weight lifted off my shoulders. Like I can just finally be myself. If that makes sense. It does. Hey, Timmy! - I guess biology calls. - Okay. I mean, you know... The other biology. Right. Timmy, Jacob's been calling for you. I was just looking for my sweatshirt. Okay... I'm sorry. - Yeah, I'm gonna... - Okay. - Yeah, okay. - See you. Oh, my... Isaiah. Are you sleepwalking again? Come on. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Let's get you back to bed. What? Excuse me! Okay... Quiet down, please. I have some very difficult news to share with you this morning. This morning, Timmy Andrews was found dead in his bedroom. The cause of death is believed to have been suicide. There are counselors for those who need it. Lily. This can't be happening. He was just here. I mean... Do you think that...? Do you think that we're sort of responsible? It's, like, he told us this huge secret. This huge secret that he clearly was not ready to deal with. No. No, something doesn't add up. He came to my room last night. And he was... He told me he felt like a weight lifted. Just the two of you? This is stupid, but I did this, like, love spell and then he came right into my room and he... He kissed me. What? He kissed me. He was already under the influence of a spell. This is so jacked up. I'm sorry, okay? Okay? Was all of this just like some game to you? - What? - All of this work that we did together was about building trust, about building community and not letting some stupid crush get in the way of everything we've... I know! Do you? I think we should take a break from magic. If we're not gonna use our power responsibly, then we shouldn't be using it at all. Agreed. Lily? I wanna talk today about weakness. Because when one of us is weak, all of us are weak. But how do we alchemize weakness into sovereign power? How do we eliminate the weakest among us You all know my son Jacob. Come here, son. Dad... Come here. My son lost a friend today. No. No, we all face tragedy every day. The question is, how do we face it? It's okay. - Dad, no. - It's okay. You're not weak. You're not weak. He was weak. It's okay. You're not weak. Can't sleep? Me neither. Lily, I wanna apologize... For being so tough on you. You know, it wasn't always so easy for me, raising three boys on my own. I had to set very strict rules and keep them in line. I know that's not how you and your mom operate... So I... I wanted to say that I'm sorry. Thanks. I know you were close to Timmy too. I... I saw you checking out the old family crest. It's actually pretty cool. These go back centuries. You know, snakes are usually considered scary or dangerous, but actually in pagan culture, they were symbols of rebirth. Anyway, it's getting late. To be continued. Lily? Are you okay? Honey. Honey, what happened? We're not safe. “What? - We're not safe here. - Wait, listen. Take a breath. Tell me what happened. He's dangerous. “Who? - Adam. I'm telling you. - What? Did something happen? Last night, he said... And I saw... He had a... I just really think we need to go. I just really think we should go. Honestly, Lily, you are going through a lot right now. Okay. Okay. Let us go somewhere new. Let's just take a road trip, just take a weekend, just the two of us, somewhere cool, somewhere fun. That could be good, right? We just need to make it through the funeral. Then I'll make it right. There's gotta be something here that proves it. Lily? You ready? Lily, we gotta go. What the hell is this? Where did you find that? You never told me? Lily. - It's complicated. - No, it's really not. It's, like, a simple conversation that should have happened a long time ago. No. You don't... Hold on. Hold on. No. This is... Don't touch me! Oh, god. It... What? - Say it! - It wasn't entirely up to me. Oh, really? Who else would it have been up to, mom? It was your birth mother. It was the one condition that she had, that I never reveal to you, and she's... She didn't want you to know that you were adopted, and I made a promise to her and... It was such a... - God, it was a complicated... - Why would she want that? Because she... She had undergone... Some trauma. I was assigned to her at the crisis center here and... Baby, I'm so sorry. You guys, I need to talk to you. - I don't think that's a good idea. - Listen to me. Please. There's no one else I can trust. Fine. Er ee ee ie se - You all right? I need to take her away from here. I need to put her first. You guys, she's not gonna harm anyone. - She already did. - She's just going through some shit. Yeah, well, what happened to our number one rule of the craft? If a person is a danger to herself or others, they will be bound. She used her powers irresponsibly. End of story. But, like, are we any better though? I mean, like, what we did to Timmy. That wasn't consensual either. Well, then maybe we should bind ourselves too. We are bound to each other and bound from magic. We prevent ourselves from doing harm. We relinquish our powers from this day forth. So mote it be. Let's go. - What? - You were right. I never should've brought you here. But I need you to agree to one thing. Whatever this is, whatever's happening here... I need you to stop it. What do you mean? I should've told you. Not just about your birth mother but about... About these... These powers. Whatever you call them, Lily, they're... You knew? I'm sorry. I was warned... That your legacy was a curse. And that the second they came online, I would have to stop them in their tracks. So, Lily... Lily, please. Honey... Let me take the burden for you. Let me take your curse so you don't have to carry it. It has been so painful, you can't imagine... To watch you understand that you were different and not know why. Now you can see why your difference... Is dangerous. But I need you to say it with me, Lily. In the name of manon... I give you my power. You can trust me. I'm your mother. My mother would never tell me my difference is dangerous. Guys? "He. Killed... Me." You guys. Who is it? "T M... M... Y" Those don't seem to be working anymore. Thanks to your so-called friends. You see, that's the thing about girls with power, Lily. They're always too weak not to use it against each other. What do you want from me? That's an excellent question. Oh, you see, Lily... I want your power. Where's my mother? Which one? Helen. She's tied up at the moment. Your real mom... Well, she's tied up too. In a different way. You're a lot like her. You know, she fought it at first, but eventually she gave in. You see, Lily, in order to gain a witch's power, she has to give them up voluntarily. So you do have a choice here. We can do this the easy way or the hard way. You'll have to kill me first. So the easy way. You guys came for me. There's no I in sisterhood, baby. Bro, there is definitely an I in sisterhood. You get my meaning. - What we were saying was... - We're sorry. We love you, and we unbind you, Lily. Guys. You girls ought to be careful in the woods at night. A lot of weirdos out here. We are the weirdos, mister. Nol You see, Lily, power... Is order. It belongs in the hands of those who understand it. It's been that way for thousands of years. Timmy's a good example of that. Until you tried to make him in your own image. So then I had to kill him... To restore the order. Because we are not in your image. We are your rulers and kings. Thing is, Lily, you got yourself here. But you're playing with fire, and I'm gonna watch you burn. - South. - East. North. Where do you think you're going? West. Air, fire, water, earth. Air, fire, water, earth. Air, fire, water, earth. Air, fire, water, earth. Fire, fire, fire. Lily! Now it's your turn to burn. Big day. - Text us after, okay? - I will. And take pics. That I can't promise. Hey, girls. - Hey, miss schechner. - Hi. How's the warlock dating pool treating you? - Are you steering clear? - Frankie! What? It's too soon? A little, yeah. It's just a joke. But, also, not really because we almost did die. We did. All right, let's hit the road, baby girl. Okay. - Good luck. - Thank you. Hey, you got this. - Love you. - Love you. - Love you. - I love you. You ready? Hi. I'm looking for... And what is your relation? Can I help you? My name is Lily. And... I'm your daughter.
