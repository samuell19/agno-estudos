With a bomb... when I went to make that last pickup. - A bomb? - Yes, sir. The one who planted it got away... - but it was definitely K.G.B. - You sure? Absolutely, sir. He had that demented Russian look. - [Man] They've been on a nonviolent kick lately. - It's him! Take cover! Let go, you idiot! He is one of us! Brulard! - [Brulard] Careful! Careful, sir. - Where did you get that goon? - Who? - Take it easy. - You! - Take it easy. Take it easy? You know, Martinson, I was almost killed today. I was almost killed today. Martinson, what's going on? I was supposed to go to the pissoir and make a pickup. I was supposed to go to the pissoir and make a pickup. - Why don't you read your orders, junior? - Who is this nutcase? Brulard, Griffin. Griffin, Brulard. He called me a nutcase. I've got eight field commendations, junior. - Stop calling me junior. - I'm fluent in seven languages, junior. - Top that. - I got laid in the fourth grade. That is enough. Drop it! Brulard thinks it was the K.G.B. I say it was not the K.G.B., and I know who it was. - [Together] Who? - Turn it off. - What? - Debug the room! Come on. Come on. This isn't bugged. Wh-Where do you think this is? The White House? [Griffin] Come on, boss. You're wasting our time. I give you my word. This room is clean. Now, no one will know what is said in here except the three of us. - I believe you, sir. - Oh, you do, huh? Thank you, Brulard. I appreciate that. Griff, where you going? What are you doing? Hessler! - [Griff] Do you still believe him? - Yes, sir. - I told you to stop doing that. - I'm sorry, sir, but I thought that you... You are not supposed to think! Out! Yes, sir. I'll certainly get right... [Sighs] All right, Griff. Let's have it. - Who tried to kill ya? - You did. - That's crazy. - That's ridiculous. Why would I try to kill you? - What makes you think it was us? - Technique. The Chinese are quiet, right? The Russians are quick, and we're sloppy. And it was a sloppy job, Martinson! - That's not evidence. - You can tell us the truth now. - Now look... - Tell us the truth. - All right. It was us. - I don't believe it. It was us, but I didn't plan it that way. I swear. - But... - It was a mistake. It was just a dumb mistake. Look. You know Klein and Stanbrook? Well, they are faces. We found out they're working both sides of the street. So we had to get rid of them. - So? - So I gave the orders to hit 'em. Their code numbers are very close to yours. Hessler got the numbers mixed up. - That is how you wound up at the pissoir. - Hessler? Boy, oh, boy. I can understand sacrificing your life in the line of duty for... for freedom or for your country, but for a clerical error? Now don't blame Hessler. I mean, he was swamped that day. I mean, you know my daughter is getting married. Well, Hessler was busy sending out the wedding invitations. Did you get yours yet? Y-You are coming to the wedding, aren't you? - Oh, yes, sir. Yes. - What are you answering him for? He almost killed us. You wanted the truth. I gave you the truth. And this is the thanks I get. [Laughs] - You try and be decent with people... - Dead is dead, brother. Decent don't count when you're dead. I tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna make it up to you both. I've got a nice soft job for you both tomorrow night. It is practically a paid vacation. - I've heard that before. - What is that, sir? Hessler, bring in the Sevitsky file. Now do me a favor, boys. Don't say anything to Hessler about this. He feels bad enough as it is. How do you think I feel? - Me too. - Now lay offhim, will ya? He got you mixed up with two other guys. - Sir. - Well, that's all, Hessler. Yes, sir. - [Flushes] - Sorry, Hessler. Got you mixed up with some other idiot. ♫♫ [Russian Traditional] [Man Speaking Russian] [People Chattering In Russian] [Woman Speaking Russian] For a defector, he's pretty good. Pretty good? Ha!

The whole thing is amateursville! Now, what is the matter with you guys? Will... Will you listen to my version of the story, sir? I already heard the police version. - The company will have it by now. - That is not the true story. Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure I believe you. How much did the Russians pay you guys? I resent that implication, sir. Sir, I suggest you're overreacting. - When you hear what Griffin has to say, sir... - Is Griff with you now? Yes, sir. If we can just come over to your place, sir... No, you cannot come over. Uh... How long will it take you to get over to your place? - About half an hour, sir. - Both of you wait for me there. Understand? Yes, sir. - Bubeleh. - Oh, shut up. I'll be back in about an hour. You wait. Bloody business. ...knew that no matter how tough the job, I'd come through. I had a reputation for reliability, for thoroughness... - As soon as Martinson gets here, tell him what you did. - What did I do? - You know. - All I know is we'd better find a place to hide... - until we get some money. - I could get fired for this! Fired? You could get killed, you idiot. - If there are any dead Russians in that gym, we've had it. - What? The Russians put pressure on Martinson, we're as good as dead, brother. - [Brulard] Bullshit! - Bullshit, yeah? - What about the agreement of'72? - What agreement of'72? - You know: A corpse for a corpse. - That's crazy. - We kill our own agent? - How much higher we gotta climb? - That's crazy. Anyway, we didn't shoot anybody. - But we started it, didn't we? - We took off with Sevitsky. - Martinson will protect me. I got eight field commendations. - Sure. - He invited me to his daughter's wedding. - I believe in the agency. - Yeah, well, I wish you believed in elevators. There's your wedding invitation. [Whirring] Hey! - [Griff] Well, partner, I think you've been fiired. - But I'm up for promotion! [Siren Wailing] [Siren Fades] - It doesn't make sense. - Yeah, well, nothing makes sense. It doesn't make sense because they spent $50,000 training me... and now they're trying to destroy all of that with a three-dollar bomb. - I'm gonna go see Martinson. - You better not let him see you first... 'cause then it's wet stuff for us. Get that through your head. - Some Russians must have gotten killed in that gym. - Oh, Jesus. Jesus. Calm down and listen to me, 'cause you don't seem to know your way around. - Is this your hideout? - No. This is just a drop I know. - Got a place we could hide out? - I know a girl. - Oh, yeah? - Why don't we go back to your place? If they left a three-dollar bomb in your place, Martinson stuck a nuclear warhead in my bed. - Martinson's okay. - He stinks. Money. Money. That's what we gotta worry about. - Got any contacts? - What? Contacts. Guys working both sides of the line. Double agents, like Lafayette. Lafayette's a criminal. You can't trust him. He's just a French guy who likes pigeons. What's that? [Brulard] This kit contains every basic life support... and essential protective device, chemical and poison. Our manual says you must have one of these in every major city you operate in. - Oh, yeah. - Boy, oh, boy. I don't know how you ever got into this organization. - It was either that or the Salvation Army. - Get that knife. - Who's the broad? - My mother. - Nice-lookin' woman. - Thank you. Get that lighter. - It ejects LS-10 nerve gas. - [Griff] Got it. - LS-10 refill. - Right. - Hey, you even got burglar tools. - Of course. - Hat and tie. - Hey. Got a pair of shorts for me? - Yeah. I hope they're clean. - Very nice. Baby, it's a perfect hideout. - Her name is Sybil. She's an anarchist. - How'd you meet an anarchist? You remember last year, the anarchists who blew up the American embassy? - Yeah. - I sold 'em the dynamite. You mean you helped blow up your own embassy? - We caught the ringleaders. That's what counts. - That's very wise. - [Siren Wailing] - Hold it. - Yeah. - [Siren Fades] In here. Okay. Okay. Now, let's get our story straight. - She thinks I'm an out of work American. - She's right. Very funny. This is just for tonight. Remember? - Just for tonight. - First thing in the morning, you take off. - First thing, crack of dawn. - Okay, now... now, we had a heavy relationship. - Oh, yeah? - You know what I mean? - Sure. - And she doesn't know my name is Brulard. - What kind of a name is Brulard? - Why? - Don't sound real. That's why. - What about Griffin? Sounds like shoe polish. - That ain't my real name. - Well, Brulard ain't my real name. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Hope they haven't changed the knocking code. - Me too. - [Knocking] - Sybil. - [Woman] Yes? - It's Seymour. - Seymour? Seymour. Seymour, I'm Ernest. Hi. - Hi. - [Sybil] Just a moment, Seymour. She'll just be a second. She's a terrific person. We were very tight for a while. I haven't seen her for two months. When you get in there, the best kind of cover for you is just to... quote Kropotkin a couple of times. - Who's that? - Kropotkin? - Kropotkin. - Kropotkin is the leading anarchist writer. Kropotkin. How long you been in the agency? Hi. - Seymour. - My friend Ernest. - He's okay. - It's been a long time. Where have you been? I got busted. But I used the time. Reading, writing, looking for answers. - Did you find any? - Me. Ernest has been in a mental institution for the last couple of years. He just escaped. Another victim of our sick society. We, uh, need someplace to stay. He's okay. He's not dangerous. He... He's an authority on Kropotkin. Well, I wouldn't say an authority. [Brulard] He's being too modest. That's why he cracked up. He'll leave in the morning. Excuse me for not being more hospitable... but it's late and I have to be up very early. - Hope you don't mind to sleep on this. - He doesn't mind. Oh, thank you very much. Anyway, I'm glad you're here. We need some more explosives. Good night, Ernest. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What? It happened again. - I shouldn't have come here. You were right. - I nearly always am. It never fails. If not every time, nine times out of 10. - What are you talkin' about? - Her. What about her? Well, couldn't you see? I mean, I came walking through that door... Jesus... and she literally raped me with her eyes. - What? - I didn't encourage her, you know. I wasn't encouraging her. You saw. I didn't come on with her. I mean, honest. I have this effect on women. A guy introduces me to his girl, and she ain't the same again. I'll flip you to see who sleeps on the couch. You sleep on the couch. You're out of your mind, man. [Chuckles] Out of your mind. You sleep on the couch. Pleasant dreams. - Seymour, is that you? - Yeah. I'm very tired. - It's okay. I'll just be a second. You know me. - [Sybil Mumbles] Fastest undresser in the West. Please. Be a good boy. We'll talk tomorrow. - Tickle, tickle, tickle. - Don't do that. - Tickle, tickle, tickle. - [Giggling] - Tickle, tickle, tickle. - [Laughing] - Tickle, tickle, tickle. Tickle, tickle, tickle. - [Laughing] Uh... [Chuckles Nervously] Sybil and I are like brother and sister. I'm sorry, uh, I woke you up. I was, uh... I was on my way to the bathroom. And it... [Stammering] Like what we used to do. [Chuckles] Tickle, tickle, tickle. Lost my socks. Well, good night, everybody. Good night. - [Sighs] - L... I wouldn't have believed it. - Nine times out of 10. - It's incredible. Well, she's all yours. Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah. Yeah. She told me to send you right in. You mean it? Mmm. Oh, well, okay. Uh, if she insists. Hmm. Now, you're sure you don't mind? I'm sure. - Positive? - Yeah. Okay. Hey. What's her name? Ethel? Sybil. Right. Have a good time. Sybil. Right. Sybil.

Lester, I remind you of our reciprocal agreement of'72. - Ah. - A corpse for a corpse. You owe me two, Lester. Do you remember last month, when our men killed your courier by mistake? He was eliminated within one hour. No one knows that better than I. You shot that son of a bitch on the spot. I mean, that... that is what I call leadership. So I just remind you, Lester, if you don't take care of it, I will. Well, uh, don't push me, Yuri, huh? I'll handle it. I only want two men responsible for mine. Huh? All I owe you is two dead American citizens. [Chuckles] And, uh... who did you have in mind? Uh, maybe Elvis Presley and Walter Cronkite? - [Chuckles] - [Chuckles] Ah, hey. What about your daughter and the boy she's marrying, huh? You have a great sense of humor, Yuri. - I like a good joke. - Yuri, look. We... We do not want another bloodbath like '70, huh?

[Scoffs] Who cares? Okay. The whole new NATO defense setup. Ha! It was in Time magazine yesterday. Look. I am desperate. Give me five grand, or learn how to fly. Five. Five. Five couldn't get you far enough. - You're dead, Griff. To save yourself would take a... - Yeah. How much? - [Gasping] - How much? How much? Half. Half... of what I can get for what Lippet is carrying. - Lippet? - 200,000. Split down the middle. - Lippet. Nobody touches him. - You can do it, Griff. A hundred grand for you.

What's the matter? - Pretty crowded in there last night, wasn't it? - What are you mad about? You want to know what I'm mad about? I'll tell you what I'm mad about. I'm mad because I came here last night with my friend... and I have not seen you for two months, and you totally ignored me, and you eye-raped him. If they gave court sentences for eye rape, you'd probably get about 20 years. - Well, he was fascinating last night. - I'll bet. - Do you want some more coffee? - Yes. Would you like to know what's attractive about him? - No. I would not like to know what's attractive about him. - Thanks. Guy's a nutcase. Attractive. [Scoffs] What's attractive about him? He has, well, a sinister quality. - Ernest? - Mm-hmm. There's a lot going on behind those big, soulful eyes. Being absolutely objective, there is more sinister quality in that little finger. And that's why I'm attracted to you too. Oh, yeah? Well, you never eye-rape me. What do you think I'm doing now? - Mmm! Mmm! - On the table. - Ow! - [Plates Clink] Sorry. Oh. Oh. - Wait. Wait, wait.

Well, give me the money, and I'll find the place. - [Brulard] All he does is go shopping. - [Griff] He can afford it... with the kind of money he got for selling out the Polish Secret Service file. - He could retire forever, the little creep. - Come on.

When I was black-bagging the Beirut run, right... I used to carry stuff worth as much as 40, 50 grand. - How did you know that? - Well, I looked in the bag. That's against regulations. You're not supposed to do that. Martinson, uh, checks your mail out every day, and you haven't ever looked in his... - Your bill, sir. - I wonder if he's carrying for Martinson. - Who cares about Martinson? I want the money. - I care about Martinson. - I care about Martinson. I had eight citations. - Yeah. I know. Eight of'em. The last thing... Man, he's trying to kill me. The last thing he said... - Jesus. Are you in or out? - I'm in. I'm in. Great. Then you take care of this. I owe you. I can't pay this. What, are you kidding me? If I thought I had to pay for this, I wouldn't have ordered this much food. - I thought you had bread. - I don't carry that kind of bread. - Well, how we gonna pay for this? - Well, l... I don't know. Um, why don't you figure it out? It was your bright idea to come in here and eat. - We don't need this kind of trouble, you know. - Boy, is this place expensive. - [Chuckles] They added it up wrong. - [Hisses] Oh. - Man, that's LS-10. - It's okay.

His name is Rover. Rover? Oh, thanks. - Hello. - [Brulard] Bonjour. Okay. Let's go. - Come on. Let's get out of here. - Not yet. - I'm warming the engine. - It's warm enough already. Not quite. It's, uh, the breaking-in period. What break-in period? Come on. What's he talking about? - It's his father's new car. He has to be careful. - Well, we can't just sit here. - Let's go. - No. We are now giving the orders. Okay. Well, tell him to get movin'. We're in trouble. [Sybil] Yes, you're in big trouble. - Turn around and keep quiet. - [Griff] Come on, fellas. Cut it out. - What are you doing? - Stop kiddin' around. You'll attract attention. I told you that was dangerous when I gave it to you. [Sybil] Save your breath, you spy. [Brulard] What are you talking about? I gave you the dynamite to blow up my own embassy. [Sybil] We know you both work for the C.I.A. - C.I. A? - C.I. A? - Oh, come on. - That is ridiculous. - We got an inside contact now. - Let's shoot them now. Wait a second. What are you stopping for? - I hear a rattle. - Well, look for it later. Come on. My father told me to write down all the rattles. I do it. Keep driving, Paul. Try to find a side road where we can kill them. - Sybil, look. How can you... - Save your breath. No smoking, please. You can burn the seats. - [Horn Honking] - [Griff] See? You're messing up the car behind us. - [Paul] Why is he tooting the horn? - I think he wants to pass. - It's Hessler. - Come on, fellas. Pull over, will ya? - Look.

Whoa! [Brulard] You see, Sybil? Now the Russians are after us. [Tires Squeal] [Tires Squealing] [Paul] Don't! Stop! You're destroying the engine! - No! - [Brulard] I'm taking a shortcut!

Get us killed? You told me to keep close, didn't ya? - [Hessler] Get around 'em! Get around 'em! - [Honking] [All Shouting] [Paul Screams] [All Shouting] - [All Shouting] - Brake. Put on the brake. [Tires Screeching] [Horn Honking] [Screams, Speaks Russian] - Watch it! - Aaah! [Russian] [Russian] [Coughing] Nice driving, Evans! Just beautiful! Don't go in the fields, huh? No! [Sybil] It's okay, Paul. It's okay. [Brulard] This car handles terrific. You know that? - [Chattering] - [Paul] Go back on the road! [Russian] [Shouting In Russian] Okay. Pull a fast one on me, will ya? Okay. That's the last time you guys get away with anything. - Made it. - Wow. - Okay. You can have your car back. - Take over. - Not a dent, not a scratch. - It's beautiful. This handles really well. - Absolutely perfect. - Handle steering. Terrific. I've been through a lot of car chases... a lot of them... but this car has held... - You know that... I hate you! - Don't be excited. Look... - I hate you! I hate you too! - We're in good shape. [Paul Screams] [Hubcap Rattles] [Chattering] [Shouting In French] - You got the letter? - The letter? The letter? Got the letter. [Griff] Look at that beautiful little microdot. - [Brulard] Pretty little microdot. - That's our ticket out ofhere. - To faraway places. - Just like you said. Right, Lafayette? [Lafayette] Hmm. [Griff] "Hmm"good or "hmm"bad? Hmm. - So-so. - I thought we had a deal. Yeah. We got a deal. 200 grand, split right down the middle, right? [Groans] I don't like that... [Imitates Groan] I'm afraid I overestimated. I thought Lippet was carrying bigger. Come on, Lafayette! Don't fool around with us. Hands off. My pigeons are armed. Antoine, shit on his head. Okay, okay. Well, what's your top offer? Now wait a minute. I want to find out what's on those things. What's on those things? No. That is not part of the bargain. Well, how much? How much? Come on. How much? - For you, 7,000. - You son of a bitch. - You're a crook. - If you wish. If you think you can do better elsewhere, think it over and decide. [Sighs] - Do you trust him? - About as far as I could throw him. Hey, how much punctuation did he take off the letter? - Two periods, two commas and a semicolon. - There's just the commas here. - Hey, Lafayette! Lafayette! - Lafayette! - Lafayette! - No! - Good-bye. - You double-crossing bastard! You bastard! Call it back! [Lafayette] Don't hurt me. All right. I'll call her back. - No! Come back! - Claudine, my little pigeon. Come back. - [Griff] Claudine! Claudine! - Claudine. Claudine. - [Gunshot] - [Groans] - Claudine. - Goddamn pigeon is armed. [Man] On your feet. Come on. Get up. Move! Get your hands up. Higher. - What'd you wanna kill him for? - Maybe I was aiming at you. You aim at me and you kill Lippet. You aim at him and you kill Lafayette. - You're a terrific shot. - Shut up. With a bodyguard like him, you don't need an enemy. - Where's Archie? - Archie? - Archie. - He thinks we're gonna tell him where Archie is? Archie's fed up with you, mate. He says you keep shooting the wrong people. I'm warning you. I'm just gonna ask once more. For the last time, where's that bloody dog? - [Screaming] - [Crashing] [Screaming Continues] - [Thuds] - [Pigeons Coo] Wow. Who the hell is Archie? - Archie? - Rover. [Griff] I told you Lippet was carrying big. The stuff on the pigeon must be in code. And the key to the code's on the dog. - And we don't have either one of them. - I know. I know. Whoops! [Tires Squealing] I understand you boys have, uh, something to sell. [Fishing Reel Clicking] Okay. - Is that all? - Well, if you check the letter out... you'll see there's some punctuation missing. - Two periods and a semicolon. - Right. - It's okay. We already got a customer. - Have you? Yeah, Uncle Sam. - Ah, Claudine. - Claudine. [Screams] You crazy... You know what she was carrying? Look what I've got here. Huh? Two periods and a semicolon. - Plunk. - No! - Leave it. Leave it. - [Laughing] - No, I spotted it. - Do you want to drown for a semicolon? Now stop the fooling around. Enough of your lying. We don't have to lie. We got the stuff. - If the price is right, we sell. - Wait, boys. Don't go away. [Over Transmitter] I'm sure we can work something out. - [Griff] How much? - [Yuri] Better than you can get from your Americans. All they want to do is kill you. - [Griff] Who says? - [Yuri] Your own boss, Martinson, told me himself. [Griff] That's what you think. He made us a terrific offer. [Yuri] All right. All right. Just let me find out... what the microdot is worth to Moscow. - [Brulard] You do that. - [Yuri] After all, who else can you sell to? The Chinese? [Laughs] What happens if they aren't on the dog? They've practically gotta be, if you were listening to Lippet's bodyguard. I mean, they weren't on the pigeon. Okay. How do we get the dog? Well, what does your manual say? When faced with an impossible situation... - Bluff. - Bluff. You got any citations for bluffing? Got a commendation for lying and a citation for cheating. [Griff] Something tells me I should have brought a gun. [Baby Crying] Look. If they get tough, I'll handle Sybil, right? [Crying Continues] [Griff] Hey, Sybil. What do you say? - Hi there. - Ça va. - Don't move. - Who's moving? Hands up. Up. - Sybil. - Shoot them. - No. No. - Wait a minute. Look. We didn't have to come here. - We came here to square ourselves with you. - Sure. - You... You got us all wrong. - Right. [Brulard] The-The truth is, we-we did work for the C.I.A. We could tell you all kinds of things about their operation. We could tell you where the secret headquarters is... - so you guys could blow it up. - All right. Tell us. Their secret headquarters... Do you know the supermarket... - It's the Four Corners Travel Service. - Check it out. - We don't have to. - Then you know you can trust us. - By the way, where's the dog? - [Gaspar] Shut up! Turn around, and keep your hands up. - Sybil. - Wait! Wait, wait. Look. There-There are all other kinds of things that we could tell you. - Yeah, there's something else. - Uh, money. - [Griff] Lots of money. - You could have a printing press. You could have two printing presses. $50,000. - That's what we could get you. - For the cause. - [Gaspar] They're stalling. - $100,000 cash. Yeah. Where would you get that money from? We'll have it in a few days. What have you got to lose by waiting? I think Paul should have a vote on this. - Yeah, Paul should have a vote on it. - [Sybil] Paul, come here. - The dog's bath can wait. - [Both] Bath? - Paul! [Speaking French] - Paul! - No, no, no, no, no. - Stop! [Arguing In French] [Screams] [Arguing Continues] - [Whimpers] - Be careful. Don't rub anything out. - Right, right. - Where do we look first? - Well, follicles. - Search his follicles. - Follicles. - [Arguing Continues] [Griff] Nice little Archie. - Paul! - [French] - What about his tail? - Does it look real to you? - [Arguing In French] - I don't like the way it wags. - Right. Check it out. - His teeth? - Right, right. - Look for lead fillings. Sure. Oh, yes. Dog. Oh... His breath stinks. - Want to change ends? - No. [Screaming In French] [Arguing] Yeah. If only you could talk. - What about his ears? - No, I already looked there. It has to be on him. - Well, it isn't. - The guy on the roof said... Wait a minute. What-What exactly did he say? He didn't say it had to be on him. Right. He just said he wanted the dog. Maybe the dog is a link. - To whoever has the microdot? - Right. - [Sybil] We've taken a vote. - Kill them. - Two for, one against. - Kill them now. You have exactly three days to deliver us $100,000. In cash. Okay. Come on. - Okay, Archie. - Where did Mr. Lippet take you? - Seymour, this is stupid. - Got any better ideas? That-a-boy, Archie. Show us your French contacts. That-a-boy. [Car Horns Honking] Hello, chéri. [Speaking French] Ah, you go to hell. [French] [French] [French] - [Speaking French] - Lippet sent us. Lippet. - Lippet. - Lippet? - He's dead. Mort. - Lippet? Lippet dead? The last thing he said was that we'd get the stuff from you. [Both Speaking French] That will cost you 80 francs. Hmm? - Eighty? - Mm-hmm. Prices have gone up. - [Chuckles] - We talking about the same thing? [No Audible Dialogue] [No Audible Dialogue] - What's up there? - Dead end. Well, what does he want to go up there for? Guess. It's a waste of time. That dog hasn't got any contacts. - Then it has to be on him. - Well, it isn't, 'cause we looked. Come on, Archie. Shake a leg. It has to be on him or in him. A capsule. Yeah. Lippet could have fed it to him yesterday in London, right? - Yeah. - How long does it take for... I don't know, but there was this Arab who tried to smuggle dope out of the Yemen. He-He made a camel swallow it in a metal capsule. - How long did it take for that? - L-I don't know... 'cause the capsule broke and the camel was on a trip for about six weeks. But if Lippet fed it to him yesterday... - I think you better check it out. - Me? - Yeah. - You check it out. - Well, I'll choose ya. - Odds. Once, twice, three, shoot. I better check it out. - Find it? - Jesus. - What's the matter? - I mean, he ain't the first one, you know. I mean, it's like a minefield back here. - Well, hurry it up. - Well, how do I know which one is his? It's the warm one. I am broad-minded, but this is ridiculous. Keeping him out all day and coming back with all that... eh! - It's a long story. - Yeah. Long and sick. They promised $100,000. - And they bring back a pile of... - Nothing. - Clean as a whistle. - You sure? - Positive. - Oh, but it's got to be. - You wanna go check for yourself? - Yuck! - Fascists. - [French] Spies. We better do this scientifically. Do what? What do you want from him? [Man] A large object, you say? - [Brulard] Between large and small. - You're sure he swallowed it? [Brulard] We're sure, yeah. [Man] Hmm. Nothing in the stomach... or the intestine. No. No obstruction. - [Brulard] Not even a tiny obstruction? - No, none at all. This is a very healthy little dog. Except of course for the left eye. I thought I had treated everything... Gorillas with hernias. Bats that could not fly. But this is the first animal I have ever met with a contact lens. - Lens? - The dog's contact lens. - May I help you, gentlemen? - This is Professor Von Kleinst of the Von Kleinst Institute. And we're looking for a research microscope that is powerful. Oui, monsieur. This is our 750 model. The best one we have. [German Accent] Yes, but obviously the 750 isn't powerful enough. If you have something with more magnification... Well, then there's the Langendorf 2000. - Langendorf makes a 2000? - Oui, monsieur. [All Talking At Once] - I'll get you a slide. - No, no. That's not necessary. The professor always carries his own. Oh, it's beautiful. The Langendorf 2000. - It's a fantastic instrument. - Yes. It is black. I cannot... I cannot see anything. - Professeur. You must turn it on. - Oh. All the ones in the... in the institute are automatic, of course. Oui, bien sûr. Holy shit! Oh. Oh, ja, ja, ja, ja, jawohl! Thanks a lot. Could you give us some technical documentation on it? Something that we can take back to the board of directors. - What is it? - It's all the Russian agents in China. - Oh. - Names, addresses of every spook agent... the Russians got working for them. That's incredible. Martinson will pay plenty for that. - Don't kiss it. - Borisenko's gonna pay a lot more. - You could smear it. - [Whimpers] You guys off to do your good deed for the day? - Where's the lucky place? - It will be told in our newspaper. Oh. With your circulation, it'll still be a secret. - Why, you... Cretin! - Not now. Imperialist! [Shouts In French] - You better get the money. - Don't worry. We will. - I hope you don't... so I can kill you. - [Blows Kiss] Morning. Off to do your good deed for the day. [French] What did Borisenko say? Wonderful things. - I got him up to $300,000. - We did it! We just have to name the place. - What's the matter? - I got a feeling I'm being followed. - Borisenko's men? - No, it feels more like Martinson's men. We better meet Borisenko someplace where Martinson can't mess it up. But where? - [Bell Tolling] - [Speaking French] Invitations at a church. I never heard of that. That's Martinson for ya. - Here's our ticket. - Who is it? - The king of Sakahari. - The king of what?
