Final boarding call for Air Canada flight four... - Jeffrey? - Charlotte? - Mm-hmm. - I'm very honored to be meeting you, Auntie. - Is that all the luggage you've got?

People poking their noses in their neighbors' business and well, we couldn't wait to get out of here, your father and I. Anyway, after Mom died, I came back to take care of the legal stuff, and I just kinda stayed. Well, here we are. - Which part would you be living in, Auntie? Unfortunately, all of it. - Father? - Jeffrey. Why don't you sit down at the table? I'll be right out. I don't want you to think I cook like this all the time. I usually eat standing up in the kitchen. - What is it? - Turkey. White meat or dark? - I'm sorry Auntie, but I am not taking meat. - What, you're a vegetarian? Oh, terrific. I guess I'll be eating a lot of turkey sandwiches for the next year or two. - I'm sorry, Auntie, but the vegetables are looking very good. - Well, fill up. Cheers. Clink it. Welcome home. Don't you know how to use a knife and fork? - I've tried with them. Well, you're gonna have to learn how to use them, because you can't really go around eating with your hands. - I'm sorry, Auntie. - Look, stop apologizing, and don't call me Auntie 'cause Charlotte will do. Oh, for God's sake. This was your dad's room. I thought, would you like to sleep here? I laid these out for you. You must miss him, huh? Me too. I always thought he'd come back. Well, good night. Sleep well. - Good night. - So, Ganesh, any interpretation please? - Miss, the immortal bard was telling us that love is beset by difficulties. - &quot;For never was a story of more woe &quot;than this of Juliet and her Romeo.&quot; And what are the difficulties the two lovers felt - They would not permit the marriage? - That's correct. Which brings us to the-- - Ganesh. Come, come, quickly. - Father? What is it? What's wrong? - Shh. It's his heart. I have not the equipment to do the test. His heart is weak. He's worn out. I left some medicalment, marumba, in case he gets this attack all over again. - Come. Eat. You must eat to get your strength back. Yes, oh master, whatever you command. Jeffrey. If anything happens to me-- - Nothing will happen. The doctor said you must rest. - There's some money buried in the strongbox under the chicken coop. It's not much, but enough, and there's a letter for you with my sister's address in Canada. I don't want to talk about this now. - I know. Just promise me you'll follow my instructions. - Nothing's going to happen. - Promise me! - I promise. I promise. Now please, take rest. I promise. Rest.

I'll be right with you, son. We got four outside pockets, they're all velcro, and two inside pockets, you got drawstrings for it, snap shut, hey move. - Hi Dad. - Hi Tom. Did you wanna ring this up for Mr. Barrett? - Sure. I just got here, he's already got me working. - Anything special I can help you with? - Charlotte said I should be giving you this. - Gee. You're Warren's kid. Charlotte told me, I'd almost forgotten. I'm Dave Randall. I was your dad's best friend. Did he ever mention me? Ah, well, you'll be going to school here. That's my son Tom. Tom's gonna be captain of basketball this year. How old are you, son? - I am 15 now. - Ah, well now, so is Tom. You'd probably be in the same class.

Do you want a drink or something? - That would be very fine, thank you. - Check out the hat, man. - It's the ace from outer space. - Having fun, guys? It's bad luck to wear a hat indoors, you know. - One club, light, no mayo, cheese fries, one beef with bacon, no onion. - Aren't you warm in that thing? - Yes. - Charlotte. - Hi. When did you get into town? - Last night. How have you been? - Fine. How's your wife? - Very funny. Who's this? - This is my nephew Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Rick, Rick, Jeffrey. - Hey. - Hey. - Why don't you go across the street to the store just over there and you can get some vegetables and things. It's just right across the street. - All right. - He's vegetarian. - No shit. - It was an honor to be meeting you, Rick. - Yeah, same here. Catch you later. - Yes. - Where'd he learn to talk like that? - India. - Well, boy, I sure missed you. - Dear Rahm. I hope you are well and have not forgotten me. It is very cold here, and the people are very different. I met a boy today, his name is Tom, and he is the son of my father's best friend. - Jeffrey! - The hell? - Rahm, there is so much I could not even begin to explain. I wish you were here. In two days I start school. - Morrison, pathetic as usual. Antonio, more pathetic than usual. Randall. Come in. Randall, if you've... What! What, are we waiting for a royal summons? What's this? All right, class, this is Geoffrey Moore from India. Great time for a transfer. What am I supposed to do with you? Perhaps consult an Oracle. Pipe down in the cheap seats. So Jeffrey Moore from India. You speak English? - Yes sir, I'm speaking English. - Oh, good good death, a relief. Why don't you just grab a seat in the back till I figure out what to do with you. Where was I, Randall. Good job your father's the mayor, son, 'cause nobody's gonna give you a job otherwise. Kochek, good job. Rosenberg, better. Big John, thanks for coming in. Carver. - Don't worry about it, it was already broken. - Okay, split up, cut the chatter. Next is holding the breath underwater for one minute. Get ready, and... Come on, you two, in. - Sure this is a violation of my constitutional rights. - In we go. - Good, Melissa. That's good, Ashley. - Is he gonna come up? - Guruji, I've come to beg humbly for a small portion of your time, but have done nothing to deserve your generosity. - Begin.

Oh, Warren was good at everything. At least I always thought he was. And then one day he came home and announced that team sports were fascist.

Boy, I remember when they snuck in to the Coopers' dressing room and they spray-painted these peace symbols on all the team jerseys and forced him to wear them for the game.

Where is our house? - Listen, why don't you get yourself some food while it lasts, okay, and get me a plate too? Okay? Thanks. - Temperatures have reached a high of 25. Another beautiful CXGB spring day in Paris on the Grand. In local news, Parisians voted overwhelmingly in support of the Grand Valley Resort Complex at City Council last night. Construction is expected to begin at once. - Oh my goodness gracious me. - What is that, anyway? - Well, it is yoga. - How does it work? - There are different positions called asanas. Some easier and many harder. - Why? I mean, why do you do it? - Well, why do you play basketball? - Because everyone expects me. I have a responsibility to the town, according to my father. - If you do not enjoy playing basketball then you should not. - Look, I'll show you what I do enjoy. It's most beautiful sound in the world. They're not so very different, basketball and yoga. - Grand Valley Resorts, gimme a break. I'm packed. How was school? - Very good. Today after school I was practicing asanas, and-- - Asanas, what's that? - It is yoga. - Where were you doing that? - In the gymnasium. And I met a boy-- - Jeffrey, you've been here almost two months, why don't you try doing more North American kinds of things, not Indian things. You're only making it more difficult for yourself to fit in here. - I'm not knowing North American things. - Well that is my point exactly, and you're not gonna learn any by pretending you're still in India, you live here now. - Well I don't want to be living here now. - Well it sure as hell wasn't my idea. Look, I'll only be gone for a few days. Here's some money. When I get back we've gotta talk, there's something I have to tell you about the house. - What about the house? - Well, we'll talk about it when I get back. - Are you going with Rick? - Not that it's any of your business, but yes I am, I'm going with Rick. - Rick is not liking me. - That is not true. - I'm not liking him either. - Will you be okay? - I'm very used to taking care of myself. - Well, here's my number. I'm off. Don't do anything dangerous. And don't stay up too late! Goodbye! - Goodbye. - That's way too close to the house. Hold it still, Frank, yeah. All right. - How much they offer you for the place? - A lot. - So take it, I sure as hell would. Relax. Come on. Let's go for a swim. - I just want to make sure everything's okay. - I'd known all along you have this maternal instinct. - What do you know? - Oh no. Hey. Is tonight Diwali? - I guess so. - You guess so. Since when does a boy of 15 guess it's Diwali? Well go on. - No, I should really be staying with you. - Go. Hurry, or you'll miss it. - Maybe just for an hour. - I'm supposed to be dying. But how can I die? I'm here. I'm a part of the whole. The whole that is one. The one that has no death, that is eternal. How can I die? I am here. - Ganesh! Where are you going, Ganesh? - Ganesh. This was in his hand. - I heard, he was saying... - Very auspicious words. He was being a very devout man. Ganesh. We will give him a good funeral. Ganesh, the body in this heat. It would be more comfortable for the funeral to take place early. - Jeffrey? - Is it okay? I found them in the attic. Are these people all my family? - Yes, I took 'em down after Mom died because it felt so much like a mausoleum. - I'm sorry, I will take them down. - No, no leave 'em up, it feels like a home. - Come. Please sit. - Mm. - Do not drink water. Eat rice. That is spicy it is, called sambar. Rice will help. Rice is better than water. Good. You see? - Mm. It's very good. Jeffrey, you remember there was something I wanted to talk to you about, about the house, remember? - Yes. - Well... Mm, god. That is really, really hot. Hmm, but very good. Well, I'm just gonna say this right out. You see, I have been offered a lot of money to sell the house, and there's a lot of repairs that have to be done, and it's just a lot of work for me, and I've been wanting to go back to Vancouver. And then you came here, and now-- - If it is what you want to do, then-- - No, that's it, I just, I don't know what I want to do. It's just, I guess... Mm. Mm. I guess I don't want to sell the house, really. I don't. I don't. Do you? - No. No, of course not. - Well then, let's not sell it, okay? - Okay. Very okay. - Deal? - Deal. - It's the spice. You have complimented my cooking. - It was very good. Very good. - Charlotte. - Yeah? - What is happening at a party? - Wait, you've been invited to a party? Great.

Girl called for you. Guess you had a good time last night. Oh my god. - What? What is it? Notice of expropriation. What is it meaning? - It means they're gonna take the house. - How could can they be taking the house? - It means they want to tear it down. - I thought we sent 78 Glenlake a notice about that fence. - We did, back in February. - I knew this would happen. - Okay, send him another notice. Motion to adopt? - Hello. - Seconded. - Discussion? - I have something I want to discuss. - Mr. Davis's fence? - No, I've got-- - Then you're out of order. - Well I don't give a damn. - Out of order. - Shh shh shh. Let her talk. - She just can't walk in here and-- - George, don't be a horse's ass. You have the floor. What is it? - Well you know damn well what it is. I have a letter here saying our house is being expropriated. - You're too late, the plan has already been approved. This is a waste of time. - Just a second. I told you last January what we were going to do. You said-- - I told you I'd think about it. - You were sent an official notice two weeks ago. - Well I didn't read it, I thought it was more junk. - Just a minute. - And you told me I had until June. - Well, we had to change the deadline because of construction schedules. - Oh, for God's sake. - Well, we've thought about it and I don't want to sell, that's final. - Wait. A lot of us here tonight have invested in this development, and we think it's best for the town. - Oh, give me a break. - Order, out of order! - Fascist bastards. - Hold on a second. - No, you hold on. We're gonna appeal, you can be goddamn sure about that. - But there's nowhere left to appeal. It's all been done legally. You're too late. Look, maybe we can sweeten the deal. - First thing tomorrow, we're gonna call a lawyer, we'll see about this. - Hi Sal. - What do you mean compensation? We hired you to find a way to keep our house, god dammit, not to make deals. No! Well you may think it's generous. No. Who the hell are you working for, us or town council? Oh, fine, we'll find someone else. - Did not sound so good. - He says we have no choice. The eviction is legal. We're supposed to be out of here tomorrow. What are we gonna do? - How was it in Kelianpoli? - Well, we walked for three days and three nights to get there. Then we began a fast to draw attention. Words of such satyagaha spreads quickly. We want no more than what is ours. Our human dignity. And so until we are recognized, no more food in our bodies, no more planning, no more harvest, no more crops. Mahatma Gandhi showed us the way. United we stand to prosper. The landlord and his goons came too. He swore he'd scorched the fields with fire before he'd give up a single acre. Empty threats, I told him. - In the end, we were less than a dozen. They laughed in our faces. When your mother was alive, it was easier to be philosophical. She used to say to me, &quot;not every battle is worth fighting. &quot;Some you're not meant to win.&quot; Remember that, Jeffrey. Lord of removing obstacles. May the lord of day grant us peace. May the lord of night grant us peace. May the lord of sight grant us peace. May the lord of might grant us peace. I bow down to , source of all power. I will speak the truth in front of the law. Guard me and my teacher against all harm. We can save the house by practicing satyagraha. It is with satyagraha that Gandhiji convinced the British to leave India. The first step is to occupy a piece of vital territory and refuse to leave no matter what. This porch will be our territory. My father spent his life fighting losing battles. In the end it broke his heart. Once we start we must never stop, till we have won. - All right. I'll just call the cafe. Jeffrey. - Charlotte? - I'm really glad you came. - Hi Charlotte. - Hi Billy. - This your nephew? - Uh-huh. - So, ready to move? - We will not be moving, your honor. - Okay. You can have until tomorrow. - We will not be moving tomorrow. - He speak for you, Charlotte? - Mm-hmm. - If you're not out by tomorrow, we'll just have to move you out. - Whatcha doing? - We are sitting here so they will not be taking our house. - Oh. - What do we do tomorrow when they come back? - We must wait and see. Sooner or later they will see that they are wrong. - Charlotte Moore? - Uh-huh. - You and your nephew are trespassing on property which belongs to the city of Paris, which has been leased to Grand Valley Resort. Will you go peacefully? - We're not leaving. - Well in that case, we'll just have to carry you out. - Then we will come back. We've begun a fast. As of today we'll be taking nothing but water. And bicarbonate of soda. - You are in very serious trouble, buddy. I don't know what it's like wherever it is you come from, but over here there's respect for the law. You want to live here, better be ready to act like a Canadian. - Who do you think you are? - My great-grandfather, his great-great-grandfather built this house with his bare hands, and if you think you can come here and scare us off, I've got news for you. - You're making a very serious mistake. You won't get away with it. - That was our first victory. - That was a victory? - They came to take us away by force. They did not. Satyagraha has begun to work. - You didn't say anything about not eating. - Good morning. May I come up? - Oh, hi Mr. Samuels. - How do, Miss. Fine day. - Yeah. Well, can I get you something, a lemonade or a beer? - Oh, lemonade, if it's not too much trouble. - All right. - Garden's a mess. What are you drinking? - It is water with bicarbonate of soda, uncle. - Sick? - No, it is to settle the stomach. We are not eating until they are changing their minds about taking our house. - So I heard. You're gonna upset a lot of people in this town. That's for sure. - It'll be easier tomorrow, won't it? Good night, Jeff. - Good night, Charlotte. Good morning. - Hi. - It's gonna be a scorcher. - Satyagraha? You don't get many opportunities to observe it being practiced. Do you mind if I? - Please. - Thanks. - Paris on the Grand, can you hold please? Paris on the Grand, can you hold please? Paris on the Grand, can you hold please? Paris on the Grand, can you hold please? - Good morning. - Where have you been? The phone hasn't stopped ringing. Mr. Dean wants you to call him immediately. Everybody wants to know what's going on up at the Moores' house. - Okay, would you get me Mr. Dean on the phone, and then when you get a moment, you bring me a cup of coffee, please? - Dream on. Paris on the Grand, how can I help you? - I mean, we should just go in there and haul him out and get on with it. - Easy for you, you're not the one that has to do it. - Yeah, well you're the man wearing the badge, Billy. - Hey, why don't you make Lenny here into it deputy? He's so fired up about law enforcement. - Damn right. I'll go in there kick a little ass for you. - Get your goddamn ass off my car! Right now! - Hey man, come on, let's go in there and get that geek. - Yeah, why don't you do it, huh? - Hey, don't be such an asshole. - What the hell's the matter with you? - Tired of that shit. He's not a geek. - Yes sir. - Hey Tom. - Hey Luce. - And here we are in day four of satyagraha, graha. We'll go again right away. And here we are in day four of sichi... All right. - My dad said Charlotte's a crackpot. - He did? What's a crackpot? - I don't know. I'll ask him. - Sarah, dinner! - Bye. - Bye. - I don't think I've ever been hungry like this before. God, half the world is starving to death and I have never even been hungry. - Come, sit. Try it, like this. Straighten your back. Good. My teacher used to say to me, &quot;the mind is the monkey in a cage, Ganesh.&quot; &quot;Always busy, always emotional. &quot;But if you stop it from moving, &quot;you're not feeling restless.&quot; - Then what? - Try it. Close your eyes. Take a breath. Take another breath, let it out slowly. As it goes out, let all your consciousness flow out with it. All your thoughts flow out and dissolve. Then take another breath. Let it out all over again. - It worked. I felt empty. No, that doesn't sound right. Steady. - Like a sail catching the wind. - They want to be martyrs, it won't be me who gives them the opportunity. Too bad, they can just sit there and get hungry. Let's see how long they can hold out. Hunger strike. It's just typical of Charlotte to be so unreasonable, acting as if we were driving out into the night. - I wanted a wing, Daddy. - Oh dear. And what we offered her was far more than the house in the land are worth at market value, and let me tell you, I had to twist a few arms, let me tell you, personally twist a lot of arms. - A wing, dear. - But I don't hear anyone thanking me. Oh no. - A wing. - What? - A wing. - Oh. - What if it was our house, Dad? - Look, son, I feel just as badly about this as you do. - Why don't you do something about it? - Like what? We can't redo the whole development plan just because of one house. - Why not? - Because it's too late. Mr. Dean has threatened to pull out if we don't move ahead. We could lose the development altogether, and a lot of people stand to lose their investments, including us. - But I thought his father was your best friend. - He was. He was my best friend. But that's not the point. - Then what is the point? - Hmm. Good move. How about there. - Satyagraha, satyagraha, satyagraha. Here we are on day five of satyagraha. How do you say it? - Satyagraha. - Okay good. Here we are on day five satyagraha. - Here's the pride of the Ottawa Valley to sing-- - Clogs to clogs in three generations. The old story. Remember the boy, always in trouble? Where did he end up? In India, dead. - They were a fine old family, the Moores. - You guys are so full of bull, you make me laugh. I knew old Duncan Moore. He built that house, and half the damn town. He wouldn't let nobody come in and tell him they were gonna tear his house down. Ooh, no sirree. He'd have been out there on the front porch. Only he'd have had his 12-gauge, and a box of shells. I don't blame them kids one bit. - Yeah, well I'd take the money. - Hell, if I lived in a dump like yours, I would too. - Just a goddamn minute. - Well, I'd do the same as them if it was my place. - Yeah, you haven't quit eating for an hour in your life, much less a week. Ah, for Christ's sakes! - Oh, I'm sorry. - What's wrong with this town? Everyone's getting so touchy. - The hell are you looking at? - So what's the latest up at the Moore place? - Talk about touchy. - Well, it's day six and Paris is still burning. The satyagraha continues, I said it! Oh. Cut. - Hello. - How are you feeling? - Empty. - When we were little, we used to think this place was haunted. - Haunted? - Ghosts, you know. Ooh. It's cold out here. - I could get you a blanket. - No. - Dave, Dave, look. It's not my style to tell a man how to do his job. But I gotta-- - Been out there a week, how long can they last? Why don't we wait two or three more days? - I hope you know what you're doing, Dave. I really do. Otherwise I gotta tell ya, there's gonna be a world of pain around the corner. There really is. - Have a little faith. - Just get it done, would you? - Doesn't look good. Making a lot of people think twice about the whole development. - Frankie? Hey Frankie. Hi, it's Joey. Yeah, fine, babe. Listen, I need you to do a favor for me. - Chair. - Why are you doing this! Come back here! - Charlotte, sit down. - Are you all right? - Who would do this? - Hi there. I'm Joey Dean, you all know the mayor. - Charlotte. - First of all, about last night. I gotta tell you, we all feel very very badly. Now, I want you to know that I understand those strong emotions that you're feeling, I really do, and I respect them. This place, the view from here, these things are important. So what I am proposing is this. When those condos are built right here, there's gonna be a two-bedroom, make that a three, a three-bedroom right here looking out at that view. You know something, it's yours, free, no strings attached. So what do you say? Can we just act like reasonable people here? Let's make a deal, let's get this thing over with. - No. - No. What does he mean no? - No is what I am meaning. Although I thank you for your offer, uncle. - Uncle? I'm not your goddamn uncle. If I were your uncle-- - I think we better leave. - God damn right. - You've got to midnight tonight to move your things out. This has gotten out of hand. This has got to stop. - That was their last chance. - And we were gonna change the world. - Lucy, why don't you take Sarah home. - Bye Jeffrey. - We're gonna shut 'em down. We gotta wait till we get a signal from the man before we move in, so just stand by, we'll let you know, over. Okay John, we copy. - Do you want some water? Oh, sorry. - All right you all right? - I'm fine, just a bit dizzy. - Come lie down. - No no, I wanna stay here. - Let's go here, come on. Take rest. I will wake you if something happens. - How many days has it been? - Please rest. - Sorry. - Jeffrey? Jeffrey. Jeffrey, it's Charlotte. She's fallen, she's in the kitchen. Maybe we should call an ambulance. - No. - I should probably go with her. - Coming through. Move it. Almost there. - Please sir, you'll have to wait outside. - To emergency immediately please. - You're Charlotte's nephew? - Yes. - This fasting. - It was my idea. - Her kidneys have started to malfunction. We're gonna keep her here for a couple of days, at least. - Can I see her? - I've given her something to make her sleep. Why don't you come back in the morning? - Time's up, folks. Let's go.
