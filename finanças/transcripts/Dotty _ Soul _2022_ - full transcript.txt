I guess the proof will be in the pudding. We're about to learn once and for all, whether Bob Brannigan bet on the wrong horse. ♪ Nuclear science ♪ ♪ I love my classes ♪ ♪ I got a crazy teacher ♪ ♪ Who wears dark glasses ♪ Next up, proposed ordinance 2301. It is my great privilege to welcome to the podium Private Car's CEO and Dallas' own, Ethan Cox. The Computer Chip. The ATM. The frozen margarita. Society changing inventions that have but one thing in common, they were each invented in Dallas. Flamboyant tech entrepreneur Ethan Cox is on the verge of a deal. Hours after speaking to the Dallas City Council. Dallas's most affluent suburb has made a controversial decision to ban public transportation. And insiders are buzzing about what that could mean for the flashy CEO and his self-driving taxi company, Private Car. Private Car, which prides itself on luxury and privacy, has become the go-to brand for well-heeled Texans looking to get around. Funded by legendary venture capitalist, Bob Brannigan, Private Car's future has never seemed brighter. In recent weeks word has it, that the company has attracted the attention of industry leader, Rydze. Rydze is now interested in acquiring Private Car in a deal earmarked at nine figures. If that deal is consummated, Ethan Cox and Bob Brannigan would stand to receive north of $30 million each. ♪ I got wishes ♪ You can't stop there. Come on, sweet cheeks. This guy smells terrible. Ugh.

And there he is! -Thank God, Diggy! -Yeah. -We need champagne. -Yes, we do. -Brother, brother! -How you doing, man? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Well, well, well, well, well, well. For those of you who don't know yet, I'm pleased to inform you that as of this evening, the city of Highland Park has just banned public transportation within its city limits. The global business of transportation has just been irrevocably changed. And the face of that change is this, toilet-paper-dragging bastard right here. I don't walk on red carpet, I walk on toilet paper. You wanna why? - Why? - 'Cause I'm the shit. To Private Car! To Private Car! To Private Car! Vanilla Charleston Chew, just got a new box in today. A real Sam Walton! Sam Walton is dead. Use Jeb Bezos. Jeb who? When are you gonna be here with my rent money ? I'll be there when I get there. After I murder this landlord, will you help me dispose of the body? -Great. I got my hatchback. -Oh. Now listen, if it's 10:01 and Ethan's not here, you lock these doors. Yes, ma'am. Oh Dora! I almost forgot. Got your water bill refunded. They were double-charging you, girl. I swear, you missed your calling. Did I come through for ya? Babe, 14,000 likes in two hours! That's my future trophy wife! Hey, to the future trophy wife! Hey! Come on! Right, hey! I still check her out, I gotta be honest. We need a pic. We need a selfie. Why am I still sober? Finally. There she is. I'm gonna miss my bus. Keep the change. You know I will. Lock it up behind you. And Dotty? Is that jacket from McDonalds? 'Cause I'm lovin' it. Hey, ma. Wish you could have been there tonight. You would have gone nuts for the sparkly table decorations. We really did it, ma. We're gonna be richer than our wildest dreams. Anything you want, ma. Anything at all. Wait and see. Alright, folks. Is this is our winner for best costume? No way! Last I checked, MC Hammer wasn't albino. You wanna win this thing? You gotta go all the way. Do it! Do it! What's going on? Where am I supposed to catch the bus? Wait! Stop! Wait! What do you think I'm doing here? Oh. Pardon me, but do you have any Grey Poupon? How can this be happening? I've been taking that bus forever. How am I supposed to get around? Don't worry about that. But right this second, I think you should just put your feet up and enjoy the magic that is, Private Car. This your company, right? That is right. You should remove the front seats entirely. I mean if your whole concept is Privacy, people should face each other. Otherwise, they are shouting private conversations. Incoming call . Where's the afterparty, baby? Really? Are you alone? Take me off speaker. Dude, who wears shoe polish at a party and who puts it their on face? Check Instagram. Your girl posted a pic. She did what? Now arriving at 3535 South Ewing Avenue, South Oak Cliff. So you didn't do this? No, I didn't. - What do you want? - Worst landlord ever. Oh yeah? Why don't you say that to my face? I just did. It's gonna stink in the morning. Just text me, dude. Uhh. Hey! And they say chivalry is dead. I'll tell you what, boys. It ain't good. It's not perfect. God, I hate this thing. Bob, that's a wedge. I know it's a wedge. I'm practicing with a wedge right now. I've had some bad things happen, there we go. But this could be the most destructive thing that's ever happened in my entire career. It might undermine the entire acquisition. Patton Oswalt re-tweeted it. 113,000 and counting. Just bought this damn thing. I got his autograph at a mouse game. Just had it worked on. Ratatouille. Goddammit! Goddammit to hell! Now let me be crystal fucking clear. Our company has backed you for five years. I have pulled strings that would have gotten a weaker man killed. And yet, we have arrived. And I don't know why that floozy of a girlfriend chose this particular moment to sabotage everything that you've worked for your entire life, and I don't even care. You know what, 'cause I tell you what, if she thinks she's gonna screw up my $140 million exit, then she has no idea who she's dealing with. -I'll talk to her. -Oh, goddamn. What, you'll talk to her... No. You're gonna step aside, son. Excuse me? Well you can't be the face of it not with what you did. We gotta have a new CEO. Somebody else to take the meetings, -that is not you. -You're kidding? At least until the acquisition goes through. It's my company, Bob. Founded in my studio apartment. You're welcome. Nobody and I mean nobody is gonna be able to stand in here and represent my vision for this company like I can. Well, I guess we're about to find out. Bob, I think that legally speaking, replacing the CEO at this stage in acquisition is gonna cause quite a few headaches. Shut up. -Just saying. -Shut up! I need legal advice from you like I need a hand job from an amputee. I'm your lawyer. Alright now, Ethan. Don't get your panties all up in a bunch. I'm not gonna cut you completely out, alright. What I need, what you need, is a person of color, cleaning this mess up. Don't worry, you'll still maintain meaningful consultation. Meaningful consultation? It's a-- It's a legal term which means you'll still get to, um... I-- I don't really know exactly, so. Get. You ruined my life! I mean I honestly thought they would be staring at me. I was basically topless. Well, they weren't. Okay, you're the one who wore it. You were standing right there next to me. - Ah . - Whatever, man. There were 15 guests that I've known for 20 years. Oh, so it's okay to be racist in private. It's not racist! It's a Halloween costume. Okay then, what's the problem? Jesus, Stef, if you can't understand how destructive that was, if you can't process how insanely idiotic that decision was, I honestly don't even know what we're doing here. The decision to post it, or the decision to wear it? We're done. This relationship is done! Done! Done! Done! You are actually the biggest fraud I've ever met. Everyone knows it. For the record, zebra print, it makes you look fat. -Voilà! -That's amazing. Right? Power of the internet, man. I got this free delivery in less than an hour. Let's just hope it's as effective when it comes to replacing a CEO. Serious question. Do you think zebra print makes me look fat? Don't worry about it. Okay. Let's go back to that Tomika person. Tomika Robinson, 38. MBA from Harvard. -Two years VP of marketing at Waze. -Four years VP of sales, -No, no. -at Postmates. -She's too qualified. I need somebody who doesn't have an MBA. You don't think Rydze is gonna require our acting CEO to have an MBA? Of course, they will. That's why we-- We just have to doctor the resume. I'm not comfortable with that. If we hire someone qualified, Brannigan is just gonna push me out entirely and you along with me, man. - He'd never push me out. - He wouldn't? He's about as loyal as a teenage prostitute, bro. Ah, sex worker. I need you to get a little more woke. It's 2023. What I need, is someone malleable. Someone I can control from the wings. But they've got to know the business, right? Just enough to play the part. So, an unqualified stooge with a basic business vocabulary? -Yeah. -Car salesman? - Yeah. - Telemarketer. - Right. - Street vendor. Sure. Oh my God. Diggy! The street vendor! Holy moley, you're a genius. Happy to help. Nora, my girl. It's Dora. Dora. Maybe she's born with it, maybe it's-- Melanin. It's melanin, dude. Black don't crack. Can we talk? Like obviously, I didn't mean anything, but-- I-- I was... The costume by the way was hilarious. You should see these parachute pants, they are amazing. And this sort of a fish net. I mean, I look great. By the way, I'm like a six pack. I mean, these days I'm looking great. Seville. You know what I mean? Okay, I know it's a bit confusing. It's not confusing at all. You did something racist. So now, you need my black face to save your white ass. I wouldn't phrase it like that. Well, that's fine, but it'll cost you. No. I'm not sure you totally understand. $15,000 up front, in cash, payable at my house tonight. $15,000? No, no. Like I said, this is only temporary. $15,000 for one month's work is really an extraordinary ask. It's a pleasure doing business with you. Love the leopard. Her mark-up's worse than Whole Foods. Wow. -Hi. -Can I help you? Yeah, I'm-- Um... Our white knight. What? Ah... Momma? Two weeks! And you best get packing. - Give it a rest, Hector. - Momma? Oh, hey. What's up, Isabella? When are you gonna make one of those nice shirts for big Hector? On 9:00 a.m., the 12th of never! Who you supposed to be, Scott Baio? Two weeks! 14,800, 14,900, 15 grand. We have ourselves a deal. You call that wholesaler and tell him to increase the inventory on the cottons and silk. You'll increase your annual sales by at least a third. -But what about? -Hector? Come on, girl. If we pay him two months, he'll want three. Pay him 5K, he'll make it 10. We gotta let him think we can't pay him. Take away his leverage. Get him to reduce the ask. I swear you missed your calling. He don't do that to anybody else. Egging our car because he thinks we're ruining the property values. Your landlord eggs your car and there's nothing you can do about it? What do you mean? I got a new job as a CEO. Do you mind if I use the restroom? Oh, take the left at the marble fountain. Then, up the double staircase, then a right at the balcony, then the sixth door on the right. There's one hallway, boy. Pee in the room that don't have my bed. For the soul. Oh no, thanks, I'm gluten-free. Mmm. Like a hot bite of heaven. What-- what-- what is it? -You never had a kolache? -Nope. It's Czech. It's like a... It's like a Hot Pocket, but less diarrhea. You comparing my kolaches to a Hot Pocket? That's like comparing the Mona Lisa to an Etch a Sketch. But nobody makes 'em like mama. -What-- what is it? -Oh, what's in it is love. That's the only part that matters. That and about six sticks of butter. Is that what you're selling in the picture in the hallway. Hmm, Mama was quite the businesswoman in her day. She was once a protégé to a very fancy Czech entrepreneur. Hm. That's one word for him. Became his business partner, too, which was no small feat in 1965. And mama was just 16 years old. Wow. So you were a chef? I was a chef. I did the marketing, I ran the books. What'd he do? He was white. They even thought about starting a brick and mortar together. That dream died. Maybe you should tell the rest. Not much to tell. Termite stole my money, I called him out, my daddy got nervous. Packed me up in the middle of the night, and put me on a bus to Dallas, never to see my home again. Young black girl couldn't get a business loan in Dallas, as it was. Kolaches, or anything else. I shoulda' made them gluten-free, then I would have had a shot. Yeah, well, I haven't had a business partner since. Did you design that? Yeah. But can you make one of these? No. Ghost orchid. One of the rarest flowers in the world. Doesn't have leaves, so it can't make its own food. Needs constant TLC or it can't survive. Tomorrow, 10:00 a.m. You got the address. I'll be there. Hm. Wow. Great googa mooga mooga suga. -You're late. -You're fabulous. You got any idea how long it took me to get here without that bus? I had to change cars twice, and then I had to walk an extra mile and a half-- Not gonna be a problem for our new CEO moving forward.

I can cut the line once I become CEO, too? I been coming here since I was 9 years old. Right, Pam? Number 23, no toast. That's the one. I'll have what he's having. You grew up in Highland Park. Well, that explains it. My mother was a housekeeper. Changed our last name to hide the fact that we were Jewish. Nadelman, that was our name. She insisted on working for all the fanciest people in town. She hoped that seeing those types of people in the flesh would rub off on me. I think it worked. It's so nice how you come to see her often. It's the least I can do. You pay them bills, too? That place ain't cheap. Two number 23's. One scoop chopped chicken liver. One scoop white fish salad. -No toast. -Right. 'Cause this is... You eat the liver of a chicken and cut off the head of a white fish. The main thing you got to worry about is that gluten. Bon appétit. You didn't even try yours. Boy, I'm 71. You know that saying, you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Well, we're gonna try.

I'm gonna do most of the talking, but the main thing to remember is, my board wants this to work. They'll do anything to make this work.

Did somebody say acquisition? I think you just did. The naughty boy is late. Why don't you come down and have a seat near me, pal? Dotty here was just telling us her brilliant idea of removing Private Car's driver seat. Do you know how much money that's gonna save us in the long run? Yeah, I'd been considering that. Don't just consider. Act! Let's get down to the heart of the meal, shall we? I'm ready for dessert. You brought me in for one reason and one reason only. I understand Rydze is hyped and ready to go. But we can't afford to mess up a nine-figure deal with some tired-ass white-boy ignorance. Am I right? A deal like this, which could permanently seal everyone you care about inside the warm cocoon of comfort is now within our grasp. Don't let it slip.

Never imagined packing up my stuff with this company still running? I don't know why they're making you do that. Brannigan said they needed the space. Hey, can I run a quick idea by you? I'm your guy. Self-driving buses. The same cheaper algorithm that you guys used to launch Private Car, now extended to people who need it the most. Think about it. Working class folk riding for half the price. Oh. Oh, I gotta head out. They're taking me to the manufacturing plant tomorrow to oversee the new interior design. Without the front seats. So much for meaningful consultation. I know it's rough. You think I'm racist? Look, only you know what's in your heart. What you did was racist, though. What you did was hurtful, and degrading, and the same thing been done by a whole lot of other racists to hold people like me back for a very, very long time. You asked. Heading to Creekside? You got the new inventory. Like I had a choice. Ah, that part's all mama. I just love creating the clothes, you know. Inventing designs that can accentuate the essence of those who wear it. It's what I was born to do. -Coming? -Right behind you. She hates you. Who, Nora? -Dora. -She's had it out for me from the moment we brought mom to Creekside. She said you're faker than a Chinatown handbag. Well, that's racist. You're very honest, did you know that? It's-- it's unsettling. She's got a point though, no? Right here is research and development. I get a kick out of it. They used a lot of my ideas. Is there any more hard hats? With this prototype, utilizing the freed up square footage we're gonna add a conference table, making this private car a private business meeting on wheels. Not bad. For long trips, we might think about allowing this table to turn into a bed. A smash-pad on wheels. I like the way the lady thinks. Smash pad? Come on. Where's my Charleston Chew? Enough with the finger, Harold. You're a diabetic! I'm not a diabetic. -I'm a leaker. -Oh jeez. I shoulda' married Ned Beatty. Based on projections, our fleet should be tripled no later than January 2024. January 2024? Don't you think that's a little aggressive? I'm just reading the timeline. And I'm just looking at the numbers. Don't worry about the numbers. Diggy? These numbers account for a tax implication that Bob doesn't feel is wholly accurate. I'll worry about the numbers. Well, now wait a second. I mean, if these numbers aren't accurate, we've gotta rework them until they are. Because if we're selling them inflated numbers, then we're just a bunch of snake-oil salesmen in suits. Ah... What did you just call me? And the fall out over Private Car continues. Weeks after the CEO's insensitive Halloween costume went viral, and a new CEO has taken over. Industry insiders are wondering can she right this sinking ship? Mom! For her safety and the safety of those around her, we need to move her to a more hands-on unit. I understand. This will be out of care and the new housing assignment will raise your invoice to 12,000. Per month? Is that gonna be a problem? Alright. If this deal falls apart, I'm gonna be broker than a sumo wrestler's bed. How is that possible? You drive around a Rolls Royce Phantom. Let's just say I live slightly beyond my means. Fake it till you make it, you heard? Hm. She called me a "snail oil salesman", Ethan. "Snail oil." I believe it was "Snake oil", Bob. Well, that's much worse now, isn't it? If this thing thinks she can waltz in here and screw up this deal, a deal we have worked on together for five years. I don't think she wants to screw up the deal, Bob. Somebody ought to shut her up. With all due respect, sir-- You know Ethan, you built this company up from scratch. And I appreciate that. But on Friday, when Dotty is introduced to Rydze, it is you that needs to be doing most of the talking. I thought that the whole point was-- You got one shot here, son. No more mistakes. If this deal dies, your career is deader than a can of corned beef. I like corned beef. You stalking me? Don't call the cops. Huh, they wouldn't come to Oak Cliff. She's 52 years old and with zero references. It's unacceptable. You've created a monster. I don't think an elderly woman should be working this hard. Who you calling elderly? An MBA would be nice. I'll leave you to it. These are baseline qualifications, David. Something written on her butt? You got the number. Team wants to run a cost analysis on the new designs. But everyone they keep sending me is simply unfit. Alright, what's up? May I? Ah. Brannigan's asked me to join the meeting on Friday. He feels that the-- the board really feels-- Spit it out, boy. They think that uh, maybe I should be the one answering questions on numbers. Because it was my baby. Okay, I see. But we still want you there. Oh yeah. For eye candy. You get what's going on, don't you? Brannigan is rude, I know that. He is uncouth, he smells like a dead animal, but he is a legend and he has gotten me where I am today. He's gotten you? Don't give away all your power, boy. He may have helped you, but it's your idea, your abilities, that surely attracted him to Private Car in the first place. At the end of the day, anything that happens at that company, good or bad, is ultimately a reflection on you. Private Car and Rydze, is it a match? You bet! The answer to my question is right here... Dotty. I didn't think I was gonna echo that loud. I was just like, "You bet". And it was like, "You bet, you bet, you bet, you bet." It's a big room. Oh Dotty, remember, smile big, don't say a goddamn thing. Scandal is poisonous. It destroys whomever it touches. Unless they are smart enough to get ahead of it. Dotty. Mmm. This is comfy. So then, I thought, Bobby, I call him Bobby. Let's just ramp up production. But we have to do it smartly. We'll save costs without front seats. Love that idea. And double our fleet by 2024. Double? Your projections say triple by 2024, don't they? I just don't think that's realistic. Okay, well, Farhad, with all due respect, we just had public transportation banned in Highland Park. And Private Car is the only sanctioned autonomous car company in the state. Pretty soon, there's not gonna be a bus route anywhere between here and El Paso. And then what happens? I mean who's gonna pick up the uh, the elderly, the handicapped, the blind? I don't think they're gonna be buying cars anytime soon. That's just me. So, tripling is conservative. Is this true? I'm not... I haven't been involved in the... She's new. She's not up to speed on the ins and outs of everything. Fact of the matter is by 2024, we're gonna be the only game in town. Ask Ethan, he'll tell you himself. That's been the plan. That's been the plan. Well, it sounds like a good one. Thank you. -Dotty, wait! -Leave me alone! I tried to explain. When did you try to explain? When I brought it up to your face, and you never said a word? When you saw how distraught I was as they pulled up my stop and you sat there with your feet up? When did you try to explain to me that the very company that you asked me to run is the same company that's destroying my life? -Destroying is a little-- -Oh, here we go, the same dude who rocks blackface in parachute pants is about to defend this repulsive behavior, too. Removing the bus stops, Ethan. That might be, a nice competitive advantage for everyone's bottom line, but in the real world that destroys lives. When my daddy packed me up and sent me away from the only home I ever knew, that bus was the only place I felt safe. You've taken that option away from thousands of people who literally have nowhere else to turn. I'd expect that of him, you know. A rich, white asshole who's had it handed to him from the day he won the sperm lottery. But from you? If your mama really was a housekeeper, let me say, I'm happy she can't understand what her boy has gone and done. ♪ Another day ♪ ♪ I call and never speak ♪ ♪ And you would say ♪ ♪ Nothing's changed at all ♪ ♪ And I can't feel ♪ ♪ Much hope for anything ♪ ♪ If I won't be there ♪ ♪ To catch you ♪ ♪ If you fall ♪ ♪ Again ♪ ♪ It seems we meet ♪ ♪ In the spaces ♪ ♪ In between ♪ ♪ We always say ♪ ♪ It won't be long ♪ ♪ Oh, but something's always wrong ♪ ♪ Another game ♪ ♪ Of putting things aside ♪ ♪ As if we'll come ♪ ♪ Back to them sometime ♪ ♪ A brace of hope ♪ ♪ A pride of innocence ♪ ♪ And you would say ♪ ♪ Something has gone wrong ♪ ♪ Again ♪ ♪ It seems we meet ♪ ♪ In the spaces ♪ ♪ In between ♪ Mom? ♪ We always say ♪ ♪ It won't be long ♪ ♪ But something's always wrong ♪ ♪ Something's always wrong ♪ Come on, I'll drive you. ♪ Something's always wrong ♪ How's Dotty doing? She hates me. Took longer than I thought. I know I haven't said it often enough but thanks for all that you do, Dora. It means a great deal to my mother, and to me. No problem. Mr. Cox? Apparently, her lungs filled with fluid, uh, but fortunately, we're able to intubate. She's hanging on. Can I-- can I see her? Ah, what are her odds? I mean, I'm not gonna hold you to it. Best-case scenario, 50/50. I'm sorry I was so late. I had a little setback at work. I think, ma, I think I've been trying so hard to prove to you that I could be the person that you always believed I could be. But I think I lost sight of who I already am. I just want you to know that I'm gonna fix it. I'm gonna make it right. I'm sorry to hear about your mom. Thank you. How can I help? I want you to stop selling snacks. Ain't nothing wrong with selling snacks. You were born to do so much more. We both were. I'm just fine with exactly what I'm doing. I'm gonna be late for my bus. I think the act of doing things the right way is a lot like raising a ghost orchid. Hey, watch it, bud! Threatened by seemingly insurmountable outside odds, they're basically impossible to keep alive. Which way you going? Come on, man, what are you doing? Pick a direction. And the-- the more ignorant those forces are of the - very real damage that they do. - Hi, Dotty. Oh. Excuse me? The harder still it becomes. But with the right caregivers, those orchids grow into some of the most beautiful spectacles on God's green earth. We gotta fight. We can't just let the orchids die. The world needs 'em. Who you preaching to, boy? My orchids been growing tall since the first moment I planted it. Your orchid. Singular. There's only so much good any one of us can do alone. Aah! Oh God! I'm leaving. Sorry about that. Blue crab hand roll. Must have turned. I just heard the news, Ethan. And I'm-- I'm sorry. About your mom passing and dying. And I... And I don't-- I don't really know what to say. I just... I hope she has the biggest wings in heaven. Big beautiful wings like a bald eagle. Soaring over a nest before she eats a salmon out of the river. Caw! Caw! Caw! That's for your mom, Ethan. You're late. And you're fabulous! Uh. What I've tried to do is utilize everything that made Private Car successful and-- And you've structured it. Just like you said. As Private Car algorithm applied to self-driving buses, so that-- People ride for half the price. -Exactly. -Well, well, well. A Tinder date gone wrong. Ethan, this is a wart on my ass. Wart, this is Ethan. You owe that wart on your ass $5,000. So, you better start shoving that money down your pants. Boom! Oh. Pulled pork sliders, our most popular dish. 100% gluten-free. Why'd you pick this place? If we're gonna be partners, we gotta think like partners. In every decision we make. Not bad. Equal partners, 50/50. And from here on out, we're only telling the truth. Real resumes. Real backgrounds. Real everything. Deal? Deal. -Ethan? -Oh hey. Oh. What is this place? This is the room where it happens. Excuse me? There he is! Ooh, Salvation Army having a sale, huh? You know, Ethan and I were old frat buddies at Tech. Nobody thought either one of us would amount to shit. Now look at us. Now look at you. Very interesting. Rides for the needy. Who would have thought? The ROI is nearly doubled. The cash on cash is like... No yeah, I.. I get it. It's uh... Brannigan, he's on board with this? Uh, not exactly. But can we count on your help, man? For Sigma Chi's Whammy Davis Junior? Of course, old chap! -So Dolly? -Dotty. Stef! Wait! I just wanted to say I'm sorry. I just should have handled it better. I should've treated you better. Well, I shouldn't have posted it. I shouldn't have worn it. Yeah, you win. I also just wanted to thank you, because without you, I'd still be making all the same mistakes. There you are! Lord have mercy, you won't believe it. I was attacked by two bunnies. Well, if you ever need some good PR, you know where to find me. Thanks, Stef. Let's go. If we stay here one more moment, my skin's gonna turn into sequins. - Finally. - Oh! Jesus, what are you hiding in my bushes? You scared me half to death. Black woman in Highland Park, man! You gotta be careful around them neighborhood vigilantes. I um... I made you something, for tomorrow. And after seeing you in your raggedy-ass T-shirt, I thought my fashion criticism may be misinterpreted. -Oh. -It's not the clothes, Ethan. It's the man. And for my money, that's plenty good enough. Now, I'm impressed. Remember, this is the kind of thing he wants to do. This is the thing he dreams of doing! When he was a little kid, growing up in Syria-- -Iran. -Iran. He dreamed of making a difference. This is that difference. If he's a bottom line man... He's a bottom line man. Once he sees our numbers... We'll have him wrapped around our little fingers. Let's make a dollar outta 15 cents. Yes! Mr. Cox? Mr. Ghorbani has an absolutely jam-packed day, and since you're both already here, would you mind if we just went ahead and got started? Do they even know we're coming? Bob Brannigan doesn't need a handwritten invitation, Diggy. Old Sage, Ethan's frat brother, roommate, butt buddy, the minute the shit hits the fan, whose side is he on? -Your side. -Damn right. I'm-- I'm allergic to cigar smoke, Bob. I empathize. I'm allergic to penicillin. Golden rule, Dig. He who has the gold, makes the rules. I can feel my uh, throat closing, Bob. Open it up. Your office said urgent. It is. We have a new proposal. You legal? Excuse me? Never mind. We'll leave it right there. I'm sorry, sir, you can't just... Call the cops. I'm sorry. And with public transportation already banned, autonomous buses could become the new wave of transportation in this city. Fully privatized, but accessible to the masses. Very interesting. Exclusivity? We've spoken to our contacts on the city council and have been assured of their full support. You can't go in there, it's a closed meeting. Nope. - Really. - We got ourselves a deal? - Bob? - Hey. We heard 8:00 a.m. Maybe somebody's secretary needs to get fired. I didn't realize you're coming. Why wouldn't I come? I'm majority investor and still Chairman of Private Car, ain't that right, Ethan? Actually Bob, we're here to discuss Public Car. Love it. Big fan of Public Car. God, I wanna do some bus business. Huh? Okay, great. I guess we could uh, put this on the list of things to address once the larger deal goes through, which I expect to be by the end of this week. Great. So, we'll do our deal and then we'll work on the new stuff. Okay? Okay. -No. -No? We only wanna do Public Car. We actually would like to dissolve Private Car. -Excuse me? -Wait, what? I don't believe in what it stands for. And to be honest, I haven't for quite some time. He's kidding. I don't like the idea of denying people transportation in order to line my own pockets. We're doing this deal. When I got into my trouble, Bob here insisted that I step down and hire a new CEO. But I didn't wanna step down from the company that I founded. So, I decided to try to control it from the wings with somebody that I knew was not qualified. I chose Dotty. A 71-year-old snack cart vendor from my mother's retirement home. I know, I look 45. It was deceptive, and manipulative. And... Wow, wow. Ooh. I'm hearing this for the first time. But listen, you're a businessman and you cannot be talked out of your vision. Now, we're gonna-- We're gonna excuse you for your impulses. No, we're not. Huh? No, we're not. No, we're not. How dare you? But Dotty here turned out to be extraordinarily qualified. More qualified for this position than anyone I've ever known. Maybe not in terms of fancy degrees or years on Wall Street, but every good idea this team has had since she was brought on board, was hers. A lot of those were team ideas. Removing the front seats, self-driving buses. I like the buses. They were all hers. She's got brilliant instincts, she's made me a better leader, and I wanna bring her on as Public Car's co-CEO. Okay. What I don't understand is, if Dotty's so qualified, why did you fake her resume to begin with? Let's just say I'm not the first white dude in her life to stand on her shoulders and call myself tall. Now I can't go back and undo what others did to her, I can't go back and undo what I did, either. I can say I'm sorry, which I am, and not just because it led to this whole PR fiasco, but what does an apology really do? For Dotty, or for anyone out there that needs to catch a bus? Wow. Wow. Oof! That's touching. I think you had just the perfect tone too. Possibly a better apology than Jimmy Fallon's. Okay, Farhad. You want to do busses? We'll do busses. You wanna keep the snack lady? We'll use the snack lady. We are gonna close this deal. You can't do both, Bob. You'll lose all your customers. As soon as the ugly truth behind the bus ban gets out, Private Car, and everything associated with it, will become the enemy. See, I've found that the best way to increase profit is by listening to the customer and giving them exactly what they want. - Okay. - When Harold Eichelbaum asks me for a Vanilla Charleston Chew, I don't hand him a Three Musketeers. What-- candy bars? What are we talking about? Now I've been riding busses all my life, which I promise you ain't true of anyone else in this room. What do the customers want? Cleaner vehicles, more bus stops and most of all, lower fares. Who's Harold Eichelbaum? I hate that you lied. Hate. And in any other case, I promise you, this would be a deal-breaker. Absolutely. But, I'm first generation Iranian immigrant so I know a few things about barrier to entry for people with darker skin. Especially in Texas. So, let's just say I'm sympathetic. If we were to do just Public Car and that's gonna take much re-thinking, you'd all still be our partners? We'd still be your partners. Wait just a minute. I've been working five years on this deal, okay. I still control the board. Me. They'll steal this company from me when pigs drive. I'm with them. What's that? I'm with them. Without my vote, you don't actually control this board. I put you on this board. To stack it in our favor, I'm aware but it's unethical, Bob. Enough's enough. You must be drunker than a fiddler's clerk. And speaking of pigs driving... Hey! Makes friends everywhere he goes. Just 'cause a chicken has wings don't mean it can fly. Don't worry, Bob, if the deal goes through, I'm sure we'll reach out for some meaningful consultation. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop that car! Hey! There's a bus stop three minutes down the road. Oh, wait. They pulled that one up! You uh, cute? Huh, you think that's cute? The concept makes sense. But these numbers have to work. And if there's even one piece of funny business in the calculations, whole deal's off. Look, I like the idea of helping the less fortunate. But this isn't a charity. Business is business. We believe those concepts don't have to be mutually exclusive. Oh, uh, if we do this, when it comes to PR, Dotty will be the face. And deservedly so. Wouldn't have it any other way. Without all those media appearances, you're gonna save a fortune on clothes. Hey, you guys are gonna have a job for me at this new thing, right? Uh, is that contagious? Dotty's got jokes now? I'd like to remind you both I still actually have a vote on this board, and I'll use it. We're still gonna need a lawyer. Who knew you had it in you, buddy? Well, I just... I don't know man. I just saw, I gotta do the right thing. I gotta do the right thing. Were you just like muttering that to yourself? 3,900, 4,000 Great, thanks. Now, it's for the next payment. We thought about paying you all this money, but then we decided that it was rewarding bad behavior. Yes, we did. Don't get cute. We just didn't feel comfortable with that. So, we're going to move. Great! And my friend Kenneth here, is going to take over our lease. What, wait? You can't do that. Article 17 of our contract, permitted transferees. Oh, no. That's just a standard contract. I never said that you can have someone to... What is he doing? You signed it. Twinsies! You kidding me? He can't make the rent. -What are you, crazy? -About that. You see, according to Texas Civil Code 1-941, a landlord is required to maintain a rental unit according to a set of minimum standards. If a landlord does not maintain a rental unit according to these standards, state law spells out tenants may withhold rent. So, unless and until, you fix everything on this list... And it's a long list. Kenneth will be living here rent free. Winning! You can't do this. If you got a problem, we got a new lawyer. Here's his card and be warned, he don't mess around. Well, what? Come back here! Come back here! You got Netflix? Shit! You said she was coming back! But Dotty's not coming back, is she? No, Harold. She's not. But she wanted you to have these. Free of charge. Eat your heart out, Jeb Bezos! Ohho! He listened! He-- he listened. Don't-- don't baby me, huh. You know I used to think you were a real special kind of ass. Now I think I get it. Thanks, Dora. Sure will miss Dotty around here though. Well, if it's any consolation, she's gonna be one heck of a CEO. I have zero doubt. Joining us tonight, is Public Car's new co-CEO Dotty Jean Bolden. Dotty, it's a pleasure to have you here with us today. Thank you, Stefani. And it's a pleasure to be here with you. Building a company with a mandate of doing so much good for those in need must have been quite the challenge. Oh honey, it was not easy. But this is a dream that I've had since I was 16 years old. And now after all these years to see that it's happening, it just makes me feel so good, you know. Robert Brannigan? Who wants to know? I.R.S! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you can't afford one, one will be provided for you. Ow! Well, I can afford one. Public Car, please hold. Public Car, please hold. Public Car, please hold. That's a little hyperbolic, but uh, yeah, we're doing really, really well. It's a people's business, Dave. If you've got the right people, anything is possible. Hey man, you karaoke? We gotta sing at the pub every Wednesday. I can be Hall, you can be Oates. I need a partner. That's a great turtleneck. You have a great neck for a turtleneck, man. Hey, Derek, can I get an oat milk latte, little cinnamon on top? Thanks, man. Uh, uh, uh, uh. No rush. Full eight minutes. Then flip. Hoping you was off to some board meeting, so I could get some peace. Look at this line, I'm doing it right! Mm-hmm. It's not right, till I say it's right. Yes, ma'am. And Derek? Keep up the good work. Ah, there you are. Five calls to return and your 6:30 p.m. has been pushed to 5:30. Oh, lord, these people are working my last nerve. Can I get you something? Yes, a nice green tea. Alright. Absolutely. Coming in right five minutes. Right? Okay. Alright. Thank you, doll. No problem. Like a hot bite of heaven, huh? Nothing like it. Guess whose designs are gonna be front and center at every Target across America? What? Oh my God! Man, that's incredible. That's incredible! -Thanks. -That's amazing. It's amazing. Thanks.
