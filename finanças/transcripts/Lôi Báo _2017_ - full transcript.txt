I live in a small, peaceful town. Sometimes, I forget how big the world really is, and how dangerous it can be. It's only when the danger comes to ones you love, that you realize the difference you can really make in this life. There's no meat in this sandwich. How can I eat this? Too much meat will make fat. Eating meat doesn't make you fat. Eating carbs makes you fat. But I'm not fat, daddy. Your coughing is gross, daddy. It's probably because I stayed up late last night. I'm alright, ok? What I meant is that you coughing into my sandwich is so gross! Why you little... Off I go. Daddy! Remember to pick me up this afternoon! Ok. I'll be there at 4:30. Uncle Ma, did you just get here? Yup, just arrived! Uncle! I'm cooking pork noodle soup tonight, your favorite. Remember to stop by for some. Sounds great! Tam told me if there's pork noodle soup, then Uncle Ma has to be there. Well, he's wrong. Only if you're the one cooking then I'll be there eating! Alright then. You enjoy yourself, I've got to get back. Another person gone missing Hey Tam, haven't seen you in a while. Hello gentlemen. So how's your new art project? I've just finalized the concept. Now I'm developing it. You've only just come up with idea, after 6 years? "Yes. This guy doesn't get it." Art takes time. You know the world famous artist Leonardo Davinci? He painted the masterpiece "Mona Lisa" He spent 12 years just painting her lips! 6 years for Tam is nothing! I'm going to go talk to Uncle Ma, you guys enjoy your coffee alright? Keep at it, young man! Even if it takes 40 years we'll support you. Hi Uncle Ma! Take a look at my new drawings. Who knows, he might be Vietnam's Van Gogh? What do you mean? Famous post mortem. Lucky his wife Linh knows how to do business because if they only relied on him, they'd be on the streets a long time ago! Lucky his wife isn't like yours. Don't you get sick of drawing violence all the time? A superhero comic must have wall-to-wall action. In my opinion, you should add more emotional and romantic elements. Look back to the old superhero characters. It's love that makes them unfocused. It even make them lose their super powers. That's what makes them more relatable, and more human. That's why your novel, "Descendent of the Crossbow" got the international medal of honor. My story is about a grandiose, superhuman character and so he must be completely invincible! How come you keep coughing? Did you get it checked out yet? Already. But I don't get the results until tomorrow. Don't worry. Just calling to let you know that you don't need to pick up your son this afternoon. I'm going to text you my bank account number. If i don't receive 100 billion dong by 1PM, then you should start thinking about finding a new son. Talk to your father. Yes sir. Hello, daddy? Remember to transfer the money on time ok, daddy? Here you go, mister. I hope you're as fast as your son. Deliver the goods to the cemetary! Fire! Check the kid. Quick! It's Loi Bao! Kill him! Bu. It's time to go to bed. Mommy, can I draw a little longer please? You have to wake up early for school tomorrow. Yes, mommy. How about Big Bu, are you going to bed early too? Same as always. Got it. Now, off to bed you go. They told me I only have 2 more months to live. That's ridiculous! I'm not even 30 years old. I don't drink or smoke. How can I have lung cancer? Then do you want a second opinion? I got checked twice already. But this time I will be the one to check. Go inside. These strawberry growing machines look pretty high tech. These are for growing humans, not strawberries. Why would you grow people? What happened to these animals? They should've died a long time ago. But they're still alive and healthy because of those "strawberry machines". Then... You're no ordinary farmer. "News of the first human head transplant in the world: 150 hours of surgery with a 90% sucess rate" "the first person to have a head translplant..." Many years ago, I was the first Vietnamese person to research the subject of head transplants. This was a hope to those patient s whose bodies were destroyed. Unfortunately after 20 years of extensive research the person who funded this project gave up. Why do you have to pretend to be a farmer? I don't have the license to do this officially. As of now, a regular surgery would take 24 hours, alongside 100 doctors and nurses. The cost would probably go up to 20 million dollars. I've put in 30 years to come up with new technology that would make the surgery much more simple and effective. This machine will exam every ounce of your body. Any illness, even the slightest cold, will not escape its eye. You only have two more weeks to live. -Hello. -Hello. Where is he? He locked himself up in the studio since last night. He just wants to finish drawing his graphic novel. I have a friend who is a professor of herbal medicine. This formula was made specifically for Tam's illness and has good results for a number of people. At this point we should just try everything. Thank you, Uncle. Mommy, look at this. It's beautiful. You really like to draw superheroes, huh? Yes, because they have a lot of strenght and power and can save a lot of people too. Bu. Go to your room, son. Yes, mommy. Drink your medicine, honey. Apparently a lot of people who drank this medicine were able to have more time. Can you just let me work? Don't give up. Who knows, this medicine might work. There's no such thing as a cure for cancer! How can you know if you don't try? I know what I have to do. I know that you are not someone who gives up easily. Where is your willpower, your determination? Here. My will is here. 6 years of my determination is right here! What has it done for me? This is everything that I can do for you and for our boy Bu. What else do I have? I have nothing at all. I thought about that too. But... But what? The problem is the cancer has spread to the brain. Where is he going at this hour? Shit! Tam! Tam! Tam. Are you alright? What are you, brain dead? Snap out of it, will you? Have you come to your senses? Let's go home. Please don't tell my wife about this. He's dead. He was shot, which means whoever shot him is still near. Let's run and call the cops later. Wait. Let me think. Bring this body home. I'm sorry. The truth is, you still have a chance. But because I couldn't find a body compatible with yours, I had to lie and tell you the cancer had spread to your brain. First I'll put you under anesthesia. And then freeze you. You'll fall into deep hibernation. Then I will create an opening in your neck in order to connect the arteries and nerves to the other body. The next part of the operation is to separate your head from your body. Lastly, your cervical spine will be fused to the donor body. It's actually simpler than it sounds. But isn't it illegal to use this body? You don't have to do this for me. I was hoping that we didn't have to go this route. But to save a life, what's right or wrong, isn't important anymore. Uncle... how come I don't feel like I'm under anesthesia at all? That's strange. You must be immune to the Nesdonal anesthetic. Let me try another one. This should knock you out. If anything happens to me, please take care of Linh and Bu for me. Mommy, please read me daddy's book. Written & Illustrated by Dang The Tam Descendant of the Crossbow After Cao Lo was unable to convince An Duong Vuong, he retreated to his hometown. Co Loa Citadel fell to its attackers, armies swarmed the castle. King An Duong Vuong only had time to hoist the princess onto a horse and escape. The two fled to the edge of the sea. They had nowhere else to go. Behind them the armies were closing in. Suddenly a huge wave rose from the waters. Kim Quy the God appeared before them. He told the king, "The enemy sits behind you." The King was shocked, turned behind him to look. A long trail of goose feathers littered the ground. King An Duong Vuong erupted in rage. Dropped the blade onto his precious daughter. Cao Lo woke up startled. Turns out it was only a dream. Little Cao Phong ran to the entrance of the village every day, Waiting for the day his father would return. He still remembered the words of his father, as if printed, before he left, "This is my last battle. I will come back soon, son." But... Cao Phong knew deep down the father he longed for everyday would never come back to him. Where is your will? Where is your determination? Daddy! Uncle Ma! Tam is awake! Can you feel anything? I'm holding your hand. I thought i'd lost you. If the truth comes out, we're all in big trouble. Therefore... We need to keep this a secret. Understand? Tam! What's wrong, Tam? Your wound is infected. It hurts so much. We'll have to increase your antibiotics. Let's go. Daddy! You're home! Bu, Bu, let go. But I want to sit with daddy. You grabbed me so hard, my head's about to fall off. Huh, how come your hands are so big, daddy? What happened to your callouses? Uh... It's because I drank so much medicine, that's all. Now give daddy a hug. I missed my chubby little man so much. Uncle... I can't draw anymore. Your ability to draw is still intact. But your new body hasn't caught up to the instincts of your mental capacity. To put it simply, you need more time to connect mind and body. You have to be patient. I want to show you guys something. "You guys wait here while I get the bike. Ok, daddy." Thief! Thief, thief! - Are You hurt? - I'm okay. Tam! Daddy! My husband's been hurt. There's so much blood. I think he needs stitches. Calm down, a doctor will be with you right away. Please fill out your patient information. Let's go. Hello, I'm Dr. Tue. I'll be examining you today. You're going to need stitches. Don't worry, I'll give you some anesthetic. What're you staring at? It's nothing. It's just that you look familiar. I think we've met somewhere before. It's possible you've inherited Nghia's memories. Innerited? This is what we call "cellular memory." Although the idea is pseudoscientific, we still have to acknowledge it. For up until now no one has been able to explain it. In the past there have been patients with organ transplants whose daily habits have changed post operation. For example, if they received the organs of an athlete, they would develop a sudden love for sports, even though before, they never participated in any kind of athletic activity. Also, it's possible that when the two genes fused together, it caused accidentally genetic mutation. That could be explain the enhanced strength that you're now exhibiting. So then... what about my feelings for Dr.Tue? Simply put, you are girl crazy. This is no time for jokes. It's possible that Dr.Tue was someone close to Nghia. Which is exactly why you need to stay far away from her. And furthermore, you need to stop fighting. What the... Oh, shit. Wrong house. According to you, daddy, if Superboy fought the Wolfman, who would win? In my opinion, Wolfman would for sure make a meal out of Superboy. How is that possible? Superboy is Superman's son. How could anyone hurt the guy? Wolfman's got razor sharp claws that can rip anyone in half. Daddy, daddy look! A car accident! - Bu, stay put ok? - Ok. Alright 1, 2, 3, lift! Forget it! Let's wait for the ambulance. When I count to 3, everyone drag him out. 1... 2... 3! Will you stop taking pictures and pull the guy out? Oh my goodness, my daddy is a superhero! "Another missing person" This situation is getting out of control. Oh, that's old news. Now this is hot! That looks just like Linh's husband from Gout Cafe. That's him, who else could it be? Oh, the "town hero" has arrived! No, my daddy is "Loi Bao"! What the hell is a "Loi Bao"? Who knows? But let's call him that for fun. I know you just mean to save people, and accidentally revealed your strength, but I'm afraid this will bring trouble to us. And affect Uncle Ma as well. But I haven't done anything wrong. I know. - But... - I think... If someone is in trouble and we don't save them, then that is wrong. True. We had a agreement. You can't go showing off your special powers in such an obvious and public way. Don't worry so much. Every single day on this earth, who knows how many strange things can happen? People forget quickly. You're the "town hero", aren't you? That's right. - Can I take a photo with you? - Ok. Hello sir. Hello, Dr.Tue. Sorry, someone has taken your table already. Let me get a different one for you. No problem. I'm sorry, I thought you were someone else. Dr.Tue. You're the Town Hero. Did you come here for lunch? Yes, I come here often But actually you're in my usual table. Sorry about that. I can move to another one. I'm just kidding. Are you waiting for a friend? Oh, I'm here alone. And you? Same. There's a girl on the balcony! Mommy! Hold onto me. Hold on tight. Even heroes feel pain? When did you get this scar? Scar? Ah... When I was little I used to climb trees and fall. These are the blood test results of Dang The Tam. Thank you very much. When did you get here, Uncle? What is this? That little girl was stuck in the fire. I just saved her. I'm beginning to think you like the fame and attention. That's a bit much. Don't foger, the operation was to save your life, not to turn you into a hero. You have your family, your career. Do me a favor and forget all of this ruckus. Focus on being a good husband and father. I truly thank you for saving my life. But you can't use that to make me do this or do that. You're not my father or even related to me to think you can interfere with my business. Tam, ever since the operation, you haven't been yourself. I'm your wife. But I have no idea what you do out there on the streets every day. Even your graphic novel, abandoned. - I just want you to be true to yourself. - I'm still me. Nothing has changed. Before I was cooped up in my room, drawing and dreaming of being a hero. You should actually be proud of me. Uncle Ma! "Savior within a burning building Profile of a hero" Tam. Oh, Tue. Did you come here for coffee? I came to find you. How did you know I'd be here? You're famous! Who doesn't know this cafe is your? Is there an emergency? How come you didn't call first? Why are you so tense? You forgot your jacket at the hospital. It was on my way, so I stopped by to return it. Thank you. Uh, so you'll be on your way then? Or do you want to stay and have a drink? Actually there is something I want to talk to you about. Please have a seat. Feel free. My boyfriend's name is Nghia. Nghia? A month ago, Nghia suddenly disappeared. His house is locked. His phone was off. None of his friends know where he was. - Did You call the police? - Yes, but no news. I'm sorry, but what does this have to do with me? The other day, I saw the scar on your back. Nghia has a exact same scar. I've always felt that he was hiding something, something even I was forbidden to know. Careful, don't fall. Hi daddy, I'm home from school! Who's this honey? This is Dr.Tue who examined me last time. This is my wife Linh. Bu, my son. Hello miss! Hello. Hello. I came to return Tam's jacket. What jacket? The jacket I forgot at the hospital. It's late. I'll be going now. See you. Dr.Tue: Noon tomorrow, meet me at Dalat Palace, I need to talk to you about something. Nghia! Who's Nghia? Don't lie to me anymore. Only you know how to find me here. I missed you so much. You got the wrong person. I'm not Nghia! No matter what it is, just tell me. Don't hide from me anymore. Nghia! Is there a problem? Just wondering, why you're coming out of my friend's house. I don't know what you're talking about. What the hell do you want? Nothing, really. Just reflexes. Nghia! Boss. Nghia has surfaced. But with a new identity. What do you mean? I think he's gone through surgery to disguise himself. Wait. Professor Thong. What a surprise. Daddy! Why are you home so late? I just went to get some drawing paper. Bu, go upstairs. Yes, mommy. You say you went to buy paper, but I haven't seen you draw anything this whole month. Or maybe you've just been busy saving the world and becoming a celebrity. Why are you trying to pick a fight with me? I'm sorry. Who's calling you at this hour? Unknown number. Probably called by accident. Tue: I know you're happy with your life right now, but I still cannot forget you. Tam: I'm not Nghia. Stop bothering me. - How's that? - Looks good, daddy. Cool, isn't it? Daddy's number one! Daddy's a superhero. Yeah! Ouch! - I'm sorry. - Nghia! Why did you come here if you don't want to be with me? I'm not Nghia. Your Nghia is dead. You were right. Nghia was hidding a lot from you. He was linked to the mafia. And I'm certain that Nghia was an assassin. I know because I found a stash of weapons in Nghia's house. And through people who were connected to him. Then how do you know that Nghia is dead? Give me the car keys. Let's go, son. Where are you going? Doesn't matter. I know where you were last night. What the hell do you want? Don't you get dizzy up there? Come down and play. There's someone who really wants to see you. How's it going? Who are you? So we don't waste more time, take me to see Professor Thong. Professor Thong? I have no idea what you're talking about. You seem to be pretty stubborn and unwilling to cooperate. Cooperate my ass. Bunch of lunatics! Uncle Ma! Uncle Ma! Why did you come here? You and I aren't close or related, remember? This is serious. What did you say? He wants to see Professor Thong? What did he look like? He's an older man, carries a walking cane. Around 70 years old? You know him? Mr.Dao. How do you know him? Uncle? Tam! Kidnap! Wife calling Have you watched the clip? What the hell do you want? Tomorrow at noon, you and the Professor come to the stairs of Hoa Binh market. Then I'll tell you more. If you try any tricks, I'll slit your wife and kid's throat. We need to tell the police. Tell the police? He'll kill my family! I'll take care of it. Stop, stop right now. Who do you think you are? You think you're a real superhero? If you don't tell the police, then your family is dead for sure. Thank god, You guys came just in time. Put your hands up! Nguyen Van Ma and Dang The Tam, you both are under arrest for kidnapping and illegal activities. We will investigate the kidnapping of your family as soon as things are cleared up. But right now we need the truth. Or else you will become our top suspect. Suspected of what? We suspect you are involved with Ngha, member of an illegal organs trafficking ring. He was involved in the string of kidnappings recently. But during the lastest operation, he suddenly disappeared. Right after that you appeared at his house. Just because I was at Nghia's house, now you think I'm a his accomplice? I think you know this person very well. Through our investigation, we know that Nghia is working with Mr.Dao. Also, in Mr.Dao's list of employees, we found your name. You've been working with Mr.Dao for the over 26 years. Your bank account has been receiving regular transfers from Mr.Dao's company. According to our records, your real name is Tran Vinh Thong. Correct. The truth is, 28 years ago, I was Mr.Dao's personal doctor. He suffered from a disease which cause most of his organs to fail. He needed to trade out organs regularly. And I was the one who performed these operations. This only temporarily prolonged his life, but did not cure him. He needed a more perfect solution, which was a whole new body. He poured an enormous amount of money into me and the project, it was an opportunity for me to prove my talent. I left my wife and child to continue my research abroad. I was so enraptured by my work, that I lost my family. Only when I returned after 26 years, did I feel devastated the choices I had made. But the thing that I couldn't believe, was that my employer was the head of an underworld criminal organization. In order to extend his life, he kidnapped innocent people to steal their organs. The very man I had worked so hard to save was actually a demon. I was so scared that I fled. And never dared to tell anyone about this. We truly want to believe you. But as you know, We need proof. I have proof. Captain, we found a head and a grave behind Ma's house. We need to confirm that it is indeed Pham Minh Nghia. I'm sorry. If only I had listened to you before. "If only" ...every man has said these words at least once in their lives. When my father abandoned us, I promised myself that when I grew up, I would never treat my family that way. Now I'm no different than my father. When I participated in Mr. Dao's project, my wife also gave birth to a son. I never thought that my success would come at such a great cost. Uncle Ma? Have you ever thought about trying to find your family? That's a silly question to ask right now. Just answer the question. I don't think they would forgive me. Of course they wouldn't. How could they forgive you? The past 28 years, you haven't fulfilled your responsibility as a husband or a father. What's the matter with you, Tam? My real name is Tran The Tam. My last name is Tran, not Dang. Do you know why all these years, I didn't need a father? Because my mother already did your job for you. She worked so hard just so I could have a decent life and a proper education. Do you know how she died? One night she was coming home from her extra shift at work, completely exhausted, she fell asleep and was hit by a truck. Where were you then?! Only now do I know, that was the name of my deadbeat father. I'm sorry son. I owe you and your mother so much. I looked for the both of you eveywhere. But when I found you, it was... I knew you were living here. and had a little boy just like me back then. These last 2 years, Why didn't your open your mouth and tell me? How do you know I didn't want to tell you? So many times I wanted to, but I didn't think I was in the position to do so. I could only be your friend. I'm here. Now what do I do? Got it. What did he say? He told me to buy some balloons. Police. Let us through. This way. Cops! Abort mission! Tam! - Daddy! - Tam! - Mommy! Mommy! - Bu! If you don't surrender, I'll kill your family. Luc, tie him up. Yes, boss. "Boss"? You're Dao's daughter! You got balls. Teaming up with the police to screw us? Wait. Pretty high tech, huh? Daddy I want to go home. Don't worry, if you do exactly as I say, your wife and child will be safe. You said you didn't know anything about Nghia. But it's more like Nghia didn't know anything about you. Too bad for Nghia. He was one of our best. Unfortunately, what made him valuable wasn't his skill, but was his actual body. After having to stitch up his wound, I found out that Nghia, the man I loved, had a genetic makeup that was a perfect match for my father. I had no other choice. My biggest mistake was using the wrong amount of anesthesia. Uncle Ma! Hey, let go. Tam! What're you doing? You're exactly like Nghia. Strength of an ox, brains of a cow. Hello Professor Thong. It wasn't hard to recognize you. The whole family is here. How cozy. You only need me. Let them go. I need you and your son's body. To be exact, from the neck down. So Uncle ma is... You weren't a waste of money after all. You have your daughter. What do you need me for? How could I be as good as you? At least you've been successful one time. After this operation, you will be the lead for all other jobs. This technology is meant to save lives, not for you to start some illegal business. Take him to the operating room. - No, Tam! - Wait. I won't do it if it's my son. Find someone else. I'm a father, so I get it. But I figure he'll sacrifice his life for his family. No, Tam, you cannot do this. - Daddy. - No, Tam. I already told you. Find another person or I won't do it. What did you do? I just pushed a button. You have 12 hours to complete the operation before mother and child inhale all the poisonous gas. When I finish the job, you'll kill everyone anyway. Mommy I can't breathe. - Turn it off. I'll do it! - You can't do it. I'll do it! When the operation is a success, then I'll turn off the machine. You can't, Tam. You can't. You can't. - You can't do this. - Daddy. I'm sorry. for not being a good husband or good father. Daddy... Stay alive to take care of our child. Captain, the economics board just sent a detailed list of Mr.Dao's assets in Dalat. Go check all those properties now. These are priceless. People will pay any amount of money to have them. There's a saying that's so true. "Your health in exchange for gold. And ultimately, gold in exchange for your life." It will all be over soon, my son. So you won't feel any pain. Now I will use Nesdonal to put both of them under. Hands in the air! Kick the door. Put your hands up. Luc, there's a problem. Speak. The cops have surrounded the tea factory. Prepare to evacuate. What's going on? How did the cops know we were here? How do I know? If you want to kill me then just kill me. Luc! Get ready to transfer the bodies. Yes, Luc. What's in there? Tea. Remove these bags! Yes sir! Stop! Dad, stay here! Don't move! Tam! We don't have a choice. That son of a bitch! He jammed the door. Back away, dad. Bu! - Bu. Wake up, son. - Bu! Bu. - Daddy. - Where's mommy? That man took mommy away. Go save Linh. Leave Bu here. I'll take care of him. Take this. Let go of me! Freeze! Put your hands up. Guns down or she's dead! You guys deaf? I said put the guns down! Help me, help me! Had enough to bite? Linh! Linh, Linh. Enough of the hero stuff, alright? I can't take it anymore. Tam! Grandpa! Daddy! I missed my chubby little man so much! - Hey come down here with your grandpa. - Hi grandpa! Daddy? I want to give you this drawing. That's right son. Even superheroes need a family. Yup! Let's go home. I finished the graphic novel. I made an appointment with a publisher 3PM this afternoon. It's beautiful. What's wrong? Maybe... being an artist is the best thing for me. And for our family. Honey. Before you go to your meeting, I want to talk to you about something. If you are able to save lives, and I stop you, then I'm wrong for doing that. You... To protect our family, you can't let anyone know about this. I guess we'll have to change the name of your comic character. I thought heroes only existed in novels and fairytales, or in the stories I drew. But the truth is, there's a hero in all of us. It's the sacrifice that go unnoticed and need nor acknowledgement, that make us true heroes.
