SHOCHIKU FlLMS "VENUS WARS" COMMITTEE PRODUCTION GAKKEN KUGATSUSHA BANDAI INC. SHOCHIKU FILMS Original Work YOSHIKAZU YASUHIKO (Serialized in Monthly Comic NORA, Gakken) In 2003, the enormous ice asteroid P-12 collided with the planet Venus. The impact stripped Venus of most of its atmosphere... and the puIverized ice formed vast acid oceans on the surface of the planet. In 201 8, the first group of colonists Ianded on the northernmost continent... lshtar. This marked the beginning of Venus Year 01 . Now... Venus Year 072: 2089 AD. Hey, don't take that! lt's my camera! What are you... OW! What did l do? Well?! Nothing in her clothes. Check her underwear! What?! How dare you, you lechers! Shut up and take 'em off! What a bunch of perverts! Well, no contraband or narcotics. Maybe there's a hidden pocket in her panties... On Earth we call 'em "unmentionabIes," buster! And don't you forget it! ls this the tragic fate of the human race? Venus, which all had hoped would be a new beginning, is now... ...a battlefield for the two states of lshtar and Aphrodia. Coming to you from Venus, for the lndependent Press... This is Susan Sommers reporting. I lost two, maybe three cylinders down the rear straight! You were way over redline, you idiot kid! lt's Rob! This way! Watch out! Look! The vaIve punched right through the piston! Nasty... Damn it! What happened? What's with Hiro? 8mm impact socket! Yessir! #1 0 plug and a screwdriver! My poor engine! Aw, c'mon. Don't cry. It's tuned to peak just under redline, so keep it 1 0%% below. Got it?! Yeah. Maggie, you're late! Sorry... it's not easy to sneak out of nursing class, you know! The gyro timing's shot, so it'll yaw some. Watch yourself! You better win, you clown! Don't hurt yourself! We've got an accident at the third turn... lots of smoke there. There goes the rescue team... This is one hell of a race, folks! Thrill a minute! We're moving into the second half now... ...with those lunatics the Killer Commandos leading by 1 5 points. But anything could happen. Lead scorer for the Commandos... ...Number 7, Hiro Seno, is in the pit with engine trouble. Dry martini... Make sure the olive is a real Ravina Sea one. This is an underground bar, Iady... We don't carry the real stuff. Are you my contact? Among other things... Welcome to Venus. And to war, after coming alI this way from peaceful Earth. Thanks. B-b-bitter! What the hell?! "Adaptor Cocktail." You'lI need it, after 3 months in space. Different air pressure and stuff here. Here's your things. Jeez, and l had the latest one, too... And this... A gift from your predecessor. Why? Came with a message: "Don't use it if you want to go home alive." Anything else? Can I get a real martini? Sure. Say, what's on the tube? BattIebike game. Want to lay a bet? The KiIIer Commandos versus the Venusian Barbarians. Bunch of Class B kids, but the gamblers love it. Both teams start at the same time with half a lap between them. You get 1 point for passing an opponent. 3 points for lapping the rival team's Queen. Scoring includes Iaps won and enemy monocycles destroyed. Sure you don't want to bet? There's still time before the... An accident! Only one so far... Pretty tame race. Hiro here! l'm on their queen's tail! SIow down, will ya?! You'll blow the engine again! Miranda's pissed! Hey! Does that happen often? It's just for the fans, I guess. It's awful! You'd never get away with such a barbaric game on Earth. Well, the crowds here go for it big time... Another drink? No, thanks. Here, take these. Better give you some change. Keep the change. Just give me the latest war gossip. I'll give you a scoop... To celebrate your new assignment. The skirmish on Tyrus... lt's all over. Total defeat for Aphrodia. l hear Ishtar is already landing on Malthulias. Wonderful! Total war! Don't act so happy. Sorry. You were saying? They might even attack lo itself... What th...? Damn, right at the good part! What's that? Air raid! You see that?! Thanks for the scoop, but next time give me an hour or two, okay?! What's that?! They're huge! What the heII?! Not when we're winning! This stinks! They dropped a ton of stuff... Miranda! Will, take these kids in your car! Load all the cycles onto the old man's truck and let's move! Hiro! Don't! Watch it! What a mess... Miranda, Route 1 's completely blocked. Go out the rear of the stadium and take the back roads. Defense HQ! Calling Defense HQ! What's moving in? Dunno, but they're huge! 3 of them entering sector Aztec! Send reinforcements! Hiro! We're at war! Where the heII are you?! Maggie's freaking out! Shut up! They've broken through! We need missiles... hurry! Great angle... Fire away! Fantastic! This is great stuff! Idiots! Watch where you're shooting! Great! Great! Sorry! Keep your eyes on the road, will ya? Hey, good timing... Give me a lift! You want a ride? l dunno... We're kind of full. Freedom of the press! Shove over! Freedom of WHAT?! MARCH 7th, VENUS YEAR 072 ISHTAR'S ELITE 1 01 st CALVARY CORPS... LAUNCH A SURPRISE ATTACK ON IO, CAPITAL OF APHRODIA I repeat, all citizens must follow the orders given by the authorities. Fighting has ceased throughout the city. Look, l've told you a dozen times already! Hey! You mind turning down that damn TV?! This is the Venusian branch of the Independent Press, right?! What? They've all gone out? So who the hell are you? Hey, wait... Pipe down, girlie. The name's SUSAN SOMMERS! Wow... They call 'em the "Octopus." lt's really called the Admiral A-1 . Look at that... Awesome! Saw 'em! They're white! I figured they'd be beige... Thought she'd have something more racy. Yeah, me too. Damn it all! Sorry guys, l win. Don't play your stupid games using me, you jerks! That was really great. I AM a pro, after all! What's alI the goddamn racket... Where's Hiro? He's out shopping. With sweet lil' Maggie... Hiro! They're heavy... Help me! The city gets blown up, and you go shopping... Just like a woman! That's not very nice! Besides, we're at war... I have to buy lots now and stock up. You'd make a good housewife. What do you mean by THAT?! No more room! This car looks cool, but it's not very useful. Tell it to Rob. lt's his car. Your foIks are rich; get them to buy you a new one. Hey, don't drive like that! There're troops alI over the place... They'll shoot us! Papers! Papers? Here. So... Wanna go? Again? Aw, c'mon! We can probably pick up some real bargains! Haven't you bought enough? Just for a little while... l hate places like that! You're no fun... Oh, all right! Jeez... What's so great about this place. What's wrong with it? The government didn't make it this way... The people did. "I want a blue sky! I want green trees, clean water, flowers, birds..." Who wouldn't want it like this? Let's go home. l hate this war! And now the news. General Gerhard Donner, Commander in Chief... ...of the Ishtar Occupation Forces, visited the mayor to pay his respects. No, that's okay... Everyone's waiting for us at Gary's. We will now show you an address given by General Donner for... Didn't I tell you? The loyal forces of Aphrodia will... What a joke! ...unite under the new government... ...to launch counterattacks against the aggressors. Help take back our stolen capital! Believe in victory!! Justice is with us! l love these new radio programs! Gonna be a real fight... Stupid kids! All you can do is talk! If you don't have anything better to do, why don't you clean up downstairs?! It looks Iike a pigsty! Lazy brats... l don't like the looks of this... l'm going out, old man. Aren't you good little boys! You going to the stadium? You're gonna get killed! They figure Route 1 is blocked. There won't be any guards. But... Open it! And don't follow me! You can't use them?! You know how hard it was to get those pictures?! That's not the point... Then what IS the point?! That this war won't make a good story? l don't believe this! The capitaI of a nation has been occupied! Look, officiaI word is that the government welcomed the occupation. PeopIe have been kilIed! More are being killed right now! Listen... ...the Earth shuttle may stop operating this week. If you want to go home, better do it now. What?! l don't believe it... lncredibIe! The army and the media are scared half to death! l heard all the bigwigs have fled the city. They pIan to regroup at Bergama down south and raise an army to retake lo. Yeah? Well, don't hold your breath! You know... l wouldn't show those soldiers so much leg. Your skirt's awfuI short for you to be crossing your legs like that. Damn it! The situation is intolerable. Three days have passed since you surrendered. I'm the victor, gentlemen, and there's a limit to my patience. If you're stalling, waiting for a counterattack from Bergama... ...by the government in exile, you're dreaming. The great war to unite Venus ended when lshtar claimed victory! Our armored units have lo surrounded. If need be, they can rain 200mm shells on any part of the city. CentraI Io is like a maze, but I wiIl not let it become a hub of resistance! It's your job to prevent any such attempts at resistance. lf you can't, I'll dissoIve your administration and police force... ...and take you all back to lshtar in chains! The lo area is now under curfew. Citizens are forbidden to leave their homes for the neXt 1 0 hours... Repeat, a curfew is now in effect. Citizens are forbidden to leave their homes for the neXt 1 0 hours... Who is it? I have something for you. Whatever you can pay. Who sent you? Joe, from the 5th Regiment. All right. What's that? The kids are asIeep... Go around back. Attention all citizens! The curfew will take effect in one hour! Shut up... I hate this war! l just HATE it! Will you SHUT UP?! Hey! Hiro! Jack? You live in a place like this? I had no idea... It's my reIatives'. They cleared out of the city, so l moved in. Lucky guy! Not that lucky. The eIevator's out, so we have to climb the stairs! Hi! Cathy? Aren't you going out with Will? You know Sue, right? That trashy blonde from Earth? He's hanging around with her now. So l dumped him! What do you think? Nice view, huh? The shower still works. Help yourself. Hey, Hiro... You don't come around here much. Bet you had a date with Maggie, huh? Next time, bring her up... She'd love it! Good idea. Gee, why not get the whole team to move here, too? Gary's place is so gross... Oh, shit... You expecting anyone? Jeez, Hiro! Just teIl them there's no one here! No one's here! Who the hell are you?! A friend of the owner! l'm just watching the place while... Freeze! Hands behind your head! The owners asked you to watch the place?! So who are they?! Speak up! Hey, you! HoId it! Halt or I'll shoot! R Block! Suspect headed your way! lntercept him! Curfew is in effect. Citizens may not leave their homes for ten hours. Curfew is in effect. Citizens may not leave their homes for ten hours... Wh- what the hell? Damn it all! Leave me ALONE, dammit! Bastards! Unit 4 here! The kid's on a monocycle, riding through Takos Market! He's taking the Route 5 detour... Cut him off! Damn it! Jerks! That's a one-way street. You cops ought to know that! Jeez... lf you guys had fought this hard against lshtar... Hey! Stop or I'll shoot! Halt! I hate this... Sorry, Andrew. Be a good boy and understand, okay? I just forgot to get cat food when l was shopping. I can't go out again for a whiIe, so you'll just have to hang in there. Wh-who is it? Daddy? lt's me... Hiro?! What are you doing here? Don't touch me! S-sorry... it really hurts. Can I rest here? Just... for a little while... Are you awake? Good thing I've been studying to be a paramedic, hmm? l'm getting better, right? I've made it to every single class... the others were always skipping out. They realIy gave me a hard time for going every day... They didn't believe war would really break out, so... Where're my pants? Oh, no you don't! Lie down! Drink this... it's good for you! it'll give you energy. Well? Good, huh? You want a sandwich? l'll make one for you. That's okay... I'd better go. If your folks come home... Don't worry. Mom and my brother have been evacuated... ...and Dad's working overtime at the Development Board. Besides, there's a curfew on. So just wait and l'll fix you a bite. Don't bother him, Andrew! I'm not even going to ASK how you got yourself shot. l swear, sometimes you're such a kid! What would you like? Tuna salad? Ham and cheese? C'mon... Sit down! This photo... Oh, that? Dad was invoIved with that a long time ago. He even got some sort of award for his work on it. lt's my parent's plantation... ...in New Musashi. I'm sure of it. ReaIIy? So even before we met, we were somehow connected... What a coincidence! Hey! What are you doing?! It's just garbage... lt is NOT, Hiro! Listen to me, Maggie! Garbage is garbage! The algae we grow on the plantation are worthless! They wilt during the Month of Heat... ...and freeze during the Month of Darkness. As long as the project continues, the government's happy. The only thing the farmers care about is making money! "Venus will soon be covered with plants..." What a lie! This war's the same... no real reasons, no real enemies, no real friends! Look at this! Our own troops did this to me! No! Stop... l don't want to know... l'm sorry... Don't... Who else have you kissed? Miranda? Cathy? You're my first... Where am I going? I live here! I'm with the Venus Development Board. Let me through! Daddy's home, Maggie. Open up. Maggie? Are you home? Open up! My pants! Never mind! Hurry! What's wrong? What were you doing? l'm tired, so don't start with me. Is somebody else here? The water's boiling... Oh, were you making a sandwich for me? Did Millfield call? Didn't think so. Great sandwich, dear. Maggie, if I can wrap up the project, we'll be evacuated next week. Looks Iike Ishtar doesn't want to Iet any more people leave the city. But using the name of the VDB will help... But Daddy! I've stilI got things to do. And classes... We're talking about saving our lives, here. It's all over for lo. The government has capituIated; there's nothing we can do about it. But Daddy! l don't want to go! l like Io! Besides, I don't want to leave my friends and... Maggie! Don't you understand how worried l am about you? Don't be so selfish! And which "friends" of yours? Those battlebike punks? All they care about is that idiotic game! l forbid you to see them! They know nothing about the real world... No sense of responsibiIity... Just worthless gutter trash! That's not true! What do YOU know?! What was that? Hiro... You jerk! One look at your face and they'd know you didn't belong there! What about Cathy? She called me a wimp, 'cause I couIdn't save her from those cops. She says she hates me... ln any case... I'm worried about Hiro. Yeah, he's on such a short fuse... Wh-wh-what?! l d-didn't do nothin'! Anti-tank missiles! Pretty smart, eh? Who would guess we were sitting on stuff like this? This is totally cool! God damn... It's the real thing! Get your hands off those! You punks... Put those back and forget you ever saw them! Don't give us a hard time... YOU'RE the one seIling stolen weapons out of a fake junkyard. You going to put those back or what? We're just gonna borrow them. We'Il return them when we're finished. Finished with what? Oh, nothing... You know that Ishtarian tank that's sitting in OUR stadium? l wanna blow it away! No kidding?! Bitchin' idea! Go for it! Idiots! You think you can just knock off a tank with no problem?! Hey, we're no pussy soIdiers... We're the KILLER COMMANDOS! Right on! We'll just move in and blow 'em away! Their machine guns'll blow YOU away. Just gonna bust that tank, huh? You Iosers can't even win a god damned battlebike game! Hey! You talk like you know everything. So when have YOU ever fought against tanks? Take a look. lt's an old story... l lost this leg back on Earth, along with buddies of mine. Guys I'll never see again... All for one lousy tank! So don't get any stupid ideas about taking on the lshtarian army. Just eat your grub and hit the sack. Hold on... Hiro! So tell me... What made you take on a tank that time? l was a stupid kid. You were? So? Seeing all those fat cats telling their lies pissed me off. So you Iost your spirit along with your leg, huh? Hiro... Jeez, Jack... you scared of a little thunder? How about gunfire? I just h-hate thunder... Won't Gary be pissed if we use his trailer without asking? Aw, he's just an old fart. If he bitches, I'll punch him out... S-sorry, sir! Just kidding... l'm a bad boy... Shut up and get to work! Storm's comin' in. Let's see you work as fast as you talk! Let's go, General! l can see it now... "Lost Generation of Venus Challenges Killer Tank!" What a show it'll make! Don't get carried away. This is no game, even if you are just a spectator. Look who's talking! Cut it out, Hiro! Yeah, when you go back to Earth, you can tell 'em about the fun show. Aw, c'mon... So... What are you trying to say? Shut the hell up! I don't want to hear your squabbling! Christ, it stinks in here... Doesn't the old man ever clean this thing? Does it smell like it?! It stinks like oil... That the one? Sentries... lt figures. lt's our show now, boys! Rob! Cover me! Hurry, damn it! Go! Move it, or you'll end up deep-fried! Get the lead out! They're all gone! You still tagging along? Great... I gotta go into battle with a broad... First blood! What the hell? Maybe nobody's home? Look out! No! Get back! Get back! Stupid kid! N- no! Give me a break! I can't stand this... That's all l get? You're more dangerous than the tank! Better hang on! This isn't going according to plan... Kenny! Tao! Get off the course! Will! You read me?! Don't let it turn back! Lure it to the end of the straight! Leave it to the tin soldier and his little bird! Who's that? Don't ask me! We're doing a great job of wrecking the stadium, anyway! All yours, old man! lt's our turn! It's the Iast stand! We're ready! Stow that crap! One extra-large Molotov cocktail coming right up! Right on! All right! High-octane gas burns real nice... l don't believe it! Bad news... Move it! Jack! Stop it! Get down! Jack! Okay... Start, damn it! Go! Hiro... Look! lt's Hiro! Hiro?! Idiot kid! Rob! Stop! That's enough! Fool! You're going too far! You're gonna get yourself killed! Give it up! You've done your best! Don't be stupid! Die now and you'll never know what you missed in life! You taping this? Tape it! B-but... Are you a pro or not?! Damn it! Another one! CIear out! Through the south gate! Quick! Miranda! Get in! Can't make the south gate... We're blocked! Damn it, they've got us figured! What the hell?! So, the battlebike riders beat us to it... What's your probIem?! Can't even handle half-power?! Your machines are bored... Give 'em some gas! You call yourselves battlebike riders?! 2-7, into the pit! 3-4, wait! Stand by on the ground. Like it or not, we're in the war. Well, it's dangerous in town, too. We're probably better off in this thing. Hey, come on... Shower with us! Jerk! Pay attention! These FMBs are no toys... They're monocycIes, but they've got the horsepower of a jeep. The new high velocity railguns have been tested and proven. You have one of those, you've got nothing to fear. What's going on? I'm dyin'... I think my leg's busted... You there! No talking! But that's only if you ride them right! So train your ass off if you want to survive! What a lecture! Who'd obey that jerk? Yeah, well... They saved us at the stadium... Idiot! I didn't ask for their help! Don't touch me! You pervert! You don't have to shove me! Hey, Sue! What's up? Here we go again. Third time... We're headed west. How can you tell? lntuition. West... Intuition. That means... ...we're headed for DontIets Desert. Farther from lo. So what happened to you? l was supposed to be sent back to Io. Lucky you! I said "supposed to." lt was cancelled. They're afraid l might leak military secrets. Us too, huh? Whose stupid idea was it to go after that stupid tank? MlNE, so shut your face! Why don't ALL of you shut up?! The only decent rack time we get is when we're on the move! So zip it, ya friggin' kids! Where's Hiro? He went below. They gonna hold him, too? Dunno... You guys want to start a battlebike team? You punks are totally worthless! So why're you Iying around like a bunch of slugs?! You lost again?! Tough! Give me a hand here! Hey! Who's there? Oh, it's you, kid. What are you up to? You Iike 'em? So pick one... I'II tune it up special for you. These babies are perfect. Perfect as coffins for you crazy kids. Do you have to go, too? Sorry, can't hear you! I'll bring you back a souvenir! Hey! Don't drag your ass like that! Look! That's 1-6! He's going up against the supply trucks? He's nuts! He doesn't have enough training. Aww... l missed him! Rock and roll! That big sucker was loaded with weapons! Those Ishtar jerkwads in lo are gonna be major pissed! Looks Iike you're doing great... You're a REAL battlebike rider now! Think so? Then how about dinner, babe? OnIy if I pay! How about Cafe Bouget on St. Germain Street? You got it. Hey, point-grabber! Aren't you bored? ReaI battIefields are the way to go... Lots better than games. C'mon, Hiro... join us! l'll even let you tag a few for yourself! No thanks. You like brown-nosing the army? Don't gimme that crap. l risk my life out there! You got a problem with that?! Some of the Io defense troops have thrown in with lshtar. So what?! We're better than those bastards! Hold it, guys! I think you're just a coward, Hiro! You talk like you're smart... but you're just pIain scared to go into battle! Not like Will, here! That's not true! I bet it is! Maybe you got shot up once, but now you're CHICKEN! You call yourself a man? Hah! What was that for?! This is none of your damn business! Who gives a damn what you think about Hiro?! What do you know about us?! You only met us a few days ago! Hey, wait! Where're you going? Sue, wait up! Attention! Things seem to be going well, Colonel Sims. Yes, sir! Cutting off their supply route has been very effective. Donner must be getting pretty upset. Well, reckless provocation can be quite costly. It's time we taught lshtar a harsh lesson. Quite so, sir! In particular, the monocycIe units have performed superbly. Should they prove effective as tank busters, they may prove... ...a major factor in turning the tide of the war. Exactly, sir. Their operating cost is low, and it's easy to find riders. Take yesterday, for example. Those kids we picked up in the city have done splendidly. Hardly "splendid", sir. But they DID, Major Kurtz! All that matters is their talent. Well yes, but... Enough! Just do your best. X-Day to retake the capital is close at hand. Bergama GHQ is counting on the success of your mobile forces. I am here before you to pass along this special intelligence: The main force of the enemy Supply Division that landed... ...near Dardanus has arrived about 60 miles northwest of us. lt's a big convoy, closely guarded. They're going to be tough, so watch your ass! WHAT?! Forget it! Why not?! Why can't I go along?! Because this is a war! A REAL war. C'mon, Sue... You saying I can't handle it?! No, no... I'm just saying that it's too risky. Don't give me that! Maybe l'm just a crummy Terran reporter, but you can't... you... You wanna mount the camera here? Yeah. Clip the trigger inside. Brilliant! Think so? I dunno about that... Good! Don't let the chief find out. He will before long... Good luck, hon! Make sure you get it all on tape! HQ to Omega lnsurgent, over. Omega Insurgent here, I read you. HQ to Omega..."The sheep have entered the slaughterhouse." I repeat, "The sheep have entered the slaughterhouse." Roger. All Hound Corps FMBs prepare for battle! Hey, I hear you put a camera on Will's rig! Don't bug me now... I'm busy! Got it! Wow! Looks great! Present location..."Slaughterhouse," edge of the Dontlets Desert! Sue! Hey, Sue... you getting this? That convoy should be close... The slaughterhouse is ready for business! Cool! Go, man! Hey, outta my way! Left wing, keep in formation! Distance: 1 .2 miles! Guard vehicles in sight! Welcome in, guys! It's no Octopus, but it's mine! Big sucker! Damn! That's enough! Stop! Check it out! Gotta nail the head first! The head, the head! Some idiot in front of me... what the hell are you doing?! Don't waste your time! Nail the... That's funny... What happened? Will! Oh my god... Will! What's wrong?! It can't be! Will! What's happened to you! The bikes can wait! Send the wounded in first! That one's useless... leave it! Over here, quick! Move it! We're buggin' out! Medic! We need a medic here! Don't block the goddamn ramp! Number 1-6! Where's Number 1-6?! Number 1-6, Will Harris! Will! Will! Answer me! Looks like we've taken a pounding... l warned you about this, sir. What reaIly matters is quaIity and how much training they've had. Treat them as expendabIes and this is what you get. Hey, Sue's... Gone! I looked all over for her. Maybe she's on another carrier? l don't think... You lent her a jeep? You morons! But sir, she insisted on going out to make sure... Of alI the dumb-shit things... That broad's dead meat! So are YOU if the Colonel finds out! You want to go back to town? How many times do l have to explain it? Once you join us, you do as we say. So what's the problem? Scared 'cause your pals got killed? That damn reporter took off, too. You're wrong! Am l? You've got no right to talk to me that way! You've got nothing to do with us. You can't order us around! You got balls, kid. Okay, no more orders. Take off if you want. But we'lI hunt you down and kiII you to keep our operation secret. You bastard! You sure DO have baIls, kid! Why not use them? I've tried to get you to train on the FMBs, but you always say no. WHY?! Our nation is invaded, and you scum won't lift a finger to defend it! You want 1-6 to have died in vain? You want to go home to mama? Fine, go ahead. But first show me what kind of man you are. I challenge you. lf you win... Hiro, don't! What's the setup? SimpIe. You'll see. This ravine runs about three miles to the main canyon. The one who gets through first wins. But be careful... These things are armed. Don't bitch if you get shot in the ass. But don't worry, kid... The cannons aren't loaded. And a few machine gun slugs won't kill you... if you're lucky. Don't do it, Hiro! This is nuts! lf you think you can make it, you go first. I always give IittIe boys a 1 0 second head start. One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten! OnIy your tire made it, eh? Can't say you won, can you. We made a deal, kid. You stay. Got me? Wish you could go with us. Anything l can do for you back in lo? I'll tell Maggie you're okay, and like that... Don't bother. She must have been evacuated by now. You better go... Don't bIame me if he changes his mind. Don't get yourself killed, okay? Don't go charging in without thinking... That's the worst thing about you! Come back alive, kid! The Commandos can't win without you! EXlLED FIGHTERS LAUNCH AN ATTACK Can you hear me? There's gunfire all over lo. You know what that means?! We're under attack! Didn't l warn you? Well? SuppIy HQ? Where's my ammo? How long do l have to wait? The enemy's harassing you? No excuses! l want fuel and ammo NOW! What is it? There's a reporter here to see you, General. Send him away! We haven't the time! Sir, it's a Terran woman. She says she's come on special assignment. Oh, very weII then. Show her in. I appreciate your kindness, General. WeII, weII... Glad you could come all this way... Some fifty million miles, yes? You seem rather nervous. Relax. They won't get this far. The Aphrodians are a disorganized, foolish rabble. No match for Ishtar. My! Confident, aren't we? GeneraI, do you mind if I take your picture before interviewing you? Shall l smile for my friends on Earth? Yes, sir... Give 'em a real big smile. Well, now! Are terrorists in league with the mass media on Earth? I'm no terrorist... l'm a reporter! But I don't care anymore... All l want is to shoot you dead! I loved him... He was a nice guy, and you murdered him! ! People die all the time. Don't blame me. You deny it? Coward! You've got more innocent bIood on your hands than just his! You're too naive to be a reporter. Commanders don't kill people... Neither do soldiers. War... That's what kills people. Justice, under the name of war, kills. All are guilty. None can be blamed. What's wrong? You can't grasp such an obvious truism. Just because you grew up on a peaceful planet like Earth... SHUT UP! I see... You're no terrorist, that's for sure. Take her away. Yes, sir! General, there are uprisings occurring throughout the city. Our infantry is working to put them down as we speak. lt's hot! Outside's as bad as inside. Wish I could shoot something. Man, you need a shower... Hey, lonely boy... Whatcha dreaming about? The girl you left behind? What do you care?! I'm scared... 'cause we're getting close to lo. lo? Didn't you know? We're defenders ofjustice, right? "Hang in there, Io... We're coming for you!" 0-7! That's you! Kurtz wants you in his office right now! Better watch out... Kurtz likes THIS! That's what YOU like, Chris! C'mon, you! Stop! C'mon, you! 0-7? Come in. What are you waiting for? Have you cIeared Jeff's lecture yet? I want you checked out. As soon as we're in position, we fight. When we reach Io? Exactly. Happy? But don't run out on me... We made a deal. Take out a few tanks for your buddies... ...just don't shoot me in the back. You aimed for my head that time, didn't you? There's armor shielding behind the seat. Did you know that? No. You're quite a guy. Tell you what... Whenever you see an Octopus, think of it as me. Then waste it. l guarantee, you'll always win. We'Il secure the cosmoport. Send the 2nd Division. Destroy the city... Leave them nothing but rubble! The cosmoport! It's the only pIace where their air transports can land. We'll capture it and cut off their evac route. Open the tailgate! Outta the way! Charlie Squadron goes first! They're still fueling up! Lto Squadron then! Go! Yo! Come back alive, baby! You goldbricking again, Chris? Probably got AlDS... Hound FMBs are expendable. Why be in a hurry to die? You get fast promotions, but the best you can do is be a non-com. I love this... When I shoot a cannon... BOOM! lt's so SEXY! Oooh... What a rush! 0-7! You're next! Move! Attention rear echeIon! The cosmoport is secured! Maintain order in the ranks! Fight! This battle will long be remembered as a tribute to our glory! Ishtar is invincible! General, we're surrounded! Order the troops to withdraw! Assume formation Alpha... Take the next target! Here comes one! lt's 2-6! Gotta be It's 2-6! Manuel! You're back early! Put out the fire! Forget the smoke! Reload the cannon first! Check the gyro, fast! Another's on the way! Outta the chair! You lazy! FalI back! Get off the ridge! They got the carrier! Let's make those bastards pay, 0-7! That's the one! Charge! Tougher than l thought! Who's there? 0-7? HlRO! 0-7, right? Hiro, the battlebike rider! Damn! Don't let them escape! Y-yes, sir! After them! What childish tactics! Run! Forget the cycle, run!! RUN, you jerk! Got 'em! Out of there! I'II get you... lmpudent little shit! General, order the withdrawal! Our cargo will be destro... No one makes a fool of us! We, whose invincibIe tanks conquered lo in a single day! Not scum like you! G-general! Full power! NOW! There are still a few pockets of resistance in lo... But we'll soon have them suppressed. We've got men searching for the Ishtarian commander General Donner... But we believe he may no longer be alive. lt's quite understandable... The city's very close. But you'd Ieave without permission, anyway. l can see it in your eyes. Wait! Your monocycle was destroyed... l'll lend you my ATV. But we'll dismount the cannon... You won't be running into any tanks. l hear he's got real talent. Think he'll be back? Probably... Move aIong! Keep in line... next! You can gab Iater... C'mon! Squeeze in! We don't have all day! Keep moving... c'mon! You're going to Io? I saw Cathy there. She told me about Maggie. C'mon! You want to see her, right? She was in the Bellevue refugee camp! Move it, lady! Going back to Earth? You bet! Remember, Bellevue refugee camp! Take care! Same to you, Hiro! Is it just desire? Is it just despair? Can't really tell anymore They say the present ties the past and future together. I don't see the present anymore Her eyes are so deep, so crystal clear. They're a labyrinth you can't escape. If you whisper to her... You might bring back that old passionate beat. Generations come and go... But there's only one thing you want to believe! What do you have now? Nothing left to lose. Basking in the pride that comes from being young. What do you have now? Nothing left to strike at. Tears your lost heart... Ride and crash! Crash and burn! Keep on running... Keep on running... Your map, all torn apart, carried off by the wind. Flew away in a cloud of dust. Lost to the past, forever. The buildings that rise up in front of you... Andrew! You bring that back! Andrew? You can't have that... Soon the sun will rise, and drive away the night. And wipe away the sorrow you can't face alone. Until your dreams can reach that distant morning glow. Hold onto those far off thoughts, never let them go. Keep them safe inside your heart. You're sure in a good mood! I hear you're getting a nice long vacation. A gift from the chief. So, where're you going? Club Med? Venus! You're sure all worked up about it. You shooting for a Pulitzer? Nope... l have friends there! You look up to face the sky. You see it start to blur. You're like a breeze, just newly born. The love you know's inside, that you can barely feel. It turns to courage when you can't run anymore. And even when you can't voice that secret prayer. Just know that soon the sun will rise, And drive away the night. Time flows gently on and on, now and forever. And until your dreams can reach that distant morning glow, Keep them safe inside your heart. Hold on to those far off thoughts, never let them go.
