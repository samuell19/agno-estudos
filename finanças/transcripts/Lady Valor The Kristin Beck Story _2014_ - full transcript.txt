One of the first things we usually do is go around the room and introduce ourselves to each other. And it can be something as simple as your name and your branch of service, what you currently do now if you... if you choose to share, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. I'm Kimmie Martin. I'm retired U.S. Army, 23 years, three combat tours, and just before I retired, I was a master instructor for UAV's. I went into the military 1957, and stayed for four years. I'm an Army veteran of 20 years. I was a military musician. I lost my job six weeks after I told my department chair that I was going to transition. I joined the Navy in '95, was a machinist mate nuclear operator, so operated nuclear power plants. I was stationed Fort Benning, did some time in Germany. I went to Desert Storm and Desert Shield. I was a company commander in Vietnam in 1969 and '70. I was a great duty and support for Cape Canaveral, turned a boy into a man, you see how that worked out. Hi, I'm Kristin Beck. That's about it. I'm Kristin Beck. I was a Navy SEAL for 20 years. During that service, I was a C.O. the entire time. I did 13 deployments. I did quite a few in combat. Bosnia, Iraq, Afghanistan, a few other spots around the world. I have a bronze star with V for valor, and a purple heart, and now I'm opening a new chapter of my life, trying to be the real person that I always knew I was, and I always wished I could be. So now, I'm finally doing it. A former U.S. Navy SEAL, part of an elite secretive team with a secret herself. Some of my SEAL team brothers, they said it's a whole different type of courage. She was a member of a special counter terrorism unit called SEAL Team Six. She says reaction to publicly telling her story has been about 50/50. Some former SEALs fully supporting her, but she also says she's heard a lot of bigotry and hatred. Someone who wants to change their gender - it just doesn't seem to fit in at all with that lifestyle. I fought for 20 years for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and I want some happiness. This is my life. I'm Anderson Cooper. In the hour ahead, you're gonna meet somebody who's demonstrated bravery time and time again as a U.S. Navy SEAL. No one ever met the real me. No one knew anything. Chris Beck details his transformation to become Kristin Beck. He became an elite Navy SEAL, and all the time, carrying a burden that finally led him to make a drastic decision. When I first came out, it was like the perfect storm, is how a couple people described it. (French reporter) Just two years ago, Kristin Beck was a highly trained United States Navy SEAL still in active duty. It is quite an amazing story. I didn't know it was gonna be that. I just wanted to tell someone my story. And maybe set an example for some of the younger generation, just say that I'm still a human being, and I deserve dignity and respect. We're Americans, and we are part of our country. It's another mission because there's a lot of freedom I'm defending by doing this. And in some ways, this is way more mentally and physically rigorous than many things I've done in my past. It's been a struggle. It's okay, Bo, we got it. Don't shift. You keep shifting for me. You gotta keep it in drive, Bo. I had a good career. After I retired, I was working at the top levels. I was briefing at the Pentagon, and my civilian level was equivalent of a One-Star Admiral, but I make some people uncomfortable because of all this. I know it. I would rather start all over again from scratch just to have my own life and live the way I thought was best. And now, I'm starting over. Face it, in our country, there are many people that go about their daily lives, and they never meet someone who's gay or lesbian, and they really never meet anybody who's transgender. I'll talk to people, just hang out, just be a regular person. If they start doing their prejudice or that bigotry, or whatever, I just try to be friendly, and I just say, hi, how are you doing? You know, good to meet you. I was that Navy SEAL, you know, transgender, you might've seen me on TV. And they go, oh, wow. And then, they realize that maybe trying to get into a fight with me wouldn't be a good idea. Maybe they should be nice. Bo wanted to stop and look at the scenic view. Come here, Bo. Come on. Bo, he's a rescue dog. He's like a year and a half. He's kind of grown up with me. But he doesn't know any difference between jeans and a dress, so it's kind of cool. I retired in 2011. I have been on the road quite a bit, giving speeches, and going to conferences, so I bought a real small RV. I guess I don't really have a real true place I can say is my home. So, I've been living out of the RV. So, I put the ski up here, so this is basically my whole clothes closet. I built a bookshelf back there, so back in the corner is a handmade bookshelf. And then all the shoes go inside of here. So now, instead of having the shoes outside, now I have access to my shoes. So, these will do pretty well. These are kind of comfortable, believe it or not. This is my underwear drawer. My underwear box. Here's like a lot of the meds I take a lot. Most of them are like pain, inflammation, there's a couple there for blood pressure. And then some other stuff for my stomach because my... my internals were all messed up. I think 'cause they were giving us so much of the shots and things, so I don't sleep, so I have to do that. It's a very small space. It's tons bigger than living on the ship though. You had just your bed, and you could lift your bed up, and you had an area about this deep that you put all your stuff in, and that was... sometimes you had a little locker. But... I was only on a ship for about three or four months, and I hope I never, never have to do that again. Okay, bubba, you ready? We are back on the road. I want to see the big ball of twine. But you're not a cat, so you don't appreciate that kind of stuff. My family is from Wellsville, New York. My father was born here, so I guess it's kind of like a hometown. We moved here when I was a kid, I graduated from high school here at Wellsville. Real small town. I think a total of like 6,000 people in the whole town, so small town America. - Lizzie? - What? Can you bring the schedule over, and let me go over that real quick with you? - Yes. - For the next couple weeks. Let me put this in... copy and paste into the generic folder. I'm gonna hire Bo as another assistant. He's doing really good. The dog gets better treatment than some of the kids. Lizzie, my younger sister, she's a real, you know, go-getter, real hard worker, so I gave her a job to help me with some of this. I have about 800 emails that are unanswered. Okay, we'll get it done. Let's just make sure there's not anybody in stress, or trouble out of those 800. - Okay. - That's all I'm really worried about. I knew that she was really trying to help people, but after helping her work, and reading some emails, I know so much more now. He's reaching out to a lot of different people, and they have no role model, and he's becoming that role model. But I feel sometimes he's going 90 miles an hour and he's gotta kind of back off and prioritize some of the things that he's doing to do a better job. So on Friday the fourth, I'm taking off, and I'll be in the RV going towards DC. Then I take off the night of the 6th, or early the 7th towards Tampa, Florida. On October 12th, I have to see the Tampa Chamber of Commerce. I need to make sure I find all those emails for the 12th. And then we'll figure out with the other folks I'm working with when we leave to California. 'Kay. Chris is moving so fast he's gonna bang into himself. Pretty soon I'll have to have an appointment to sit down and see what's going on. Maybe you can make time for me. We used to say he was like a ferret, he moved so quickly, he was totally animated, and when he slept, he slept hard. It was like he expended all his energy, and then he just kind of went out. He was an outgoing person, rode horses, he grew up hunting, part of our life, we lived on a farm, and he was all into it, he was all boy. Dad, I'm unloaded, ready to go. My dad, he was a football coach, and pretty hardcore when I was a kid. He was strict. Strict and fair. But now, I think he's mellowing with age. You scared me. And we're older, so it's hard for him to yell at us anymore. He was tough. I was tough, and I apologized one time to him that I didn't know any other way to bring you up, but at times, hard knows you. Bullseye. You were a middle child, and you were always testing. I was right next to him for every... every whooping because we were both in cahoots... You know. We were both in cahoots. We had a lot of fun. I like your outfit. I think I'm under-dressed. I think I got this outfit from you. You got some nine mill, sweet. - All right, we good? - Ready? - Gardener, don't stop moving out. - Well... Ready? Pull. - Okay, I throw like a girl. - I got two. Ha! Gardener, he's a year and a half older. We moved a lot when we were growing up, and during one of the moves he got held back one year, so he was a year older in the same grade, so we had our little rivalries. And I think we've made up quite a bit. I'm going forward because otherwise you're blocking me, right in front of you... Yeah, okay, okay, okay. I mean, everything's for a reason, Gardener. - I'm not saying nothing. - I'm not cheating. - I'm not saying nothing about cheating. - That's why dad's right there. The fuck, I want a little room here. Hey, no swearing. I mean he wasn't a good athlete, I was. It was easy for me, but he had to work at it. And he would work at it, and he'd work at it, and he'd be against a brick wall just throwing it, just going, just going, you know, and he had the drive, and he had the smarts. He was always straight A, he was always bam, bam, bam. Nice. I haven't seen these two together like this... long time. Ready? Yeah. Go. The most fun I've had in years. Having everybody together, it's so... emotional. I'm gonna cry. We're going on Dad, he's the boss. Ready? Go. Kristin and I, I don't think we got along so well because I was the baby of the family, so there was a whole lot of, you know, Liz gets everything, you know, Liz is a brat. By the way, I was the one that made that milk jug go way back there. So Lizzie, she's probably 10 or 12 years younger than I am. So, when I was in high school, getting ready to leave for college, she was just a youngster. So, I never really had a relationship with her at that time. Look at those boots. I like those boots. When I was at college then I went in the military, and I've been pretty much gone for almost all of her life. It's great now. Kristin and I get along great. You know, we're... I... I feel like she's my rock, I'm her rock right now, especially lately, since she's been here visiting. Your dad used to shop in here all the time. Well... I'm so jealous because all the time he would come in here and buy like five or six things - for all the girls in the family. - For the girls. And he'd get me like a fishing reel. Or a tie. Or a tie. If I grew up with Kristin as a girl, I think we would've been best friends. I really do. It... it's just interesting. The sweeter side of Chris is out, which would be Kristin, and it's... it's awesome. They look good. When Chris was going into the military, I remember going on a motorcycle ride and really spending some quality time with his little... or her little sister. That meant a lot to me. I was beyond... beyond proud. For sure. The skies over Baghdad have been illuminated. We're seeing bright flashes going off all over the sky. Desert Shield and Desert Storm happened, and I went into the Navy. When the SEAL team recruiter came around to boot camp, I raised my hand with about 200 other people. About two of us made it. Then I was off to SEAL training. Each year 600 to 800 young men attempt the basic underwater demolition SEAL training, or BUDS, but only one third complete the rigorous 25-week transition from sailor to SEAL. They're not teaching you anything at SEAL team basic training. That is all just a selection. They're gonna mentally, physically, emotionally abuse you, right up to the point of failure. And then see if you can come back from that point. If you don't, then you just wash away. We always talk about the suck factor, and one's pegging all the way over, and it's like really bad, and you're like, man, why am I doing this? And then you just take that one more step. You say, okay, I'm gonna make it one more mile. Thousands of people try to do it, but only a few make it. Then you go to more advanced schools. Now, you're learning how to do stuff. So, you're learning how to really use explosives, you're learning how to do the shoot and then move in. Yeah! What you doing, Chris? Just building window charges. If you got some windows up there with frames in them, we're gonna blow the window and blow the frame. And after that time, that full year, then you finally become a SEAL. Then you wear your Budweiser. The SEAL team trident, which is this little thing right here is the SEAL team trident. He just worked hard and became an outstanding SEAL. He was the hero for 20 years to this town. - Hey! - What's going on? And I've seen so many of his friends here in Wellsville rallied around him. Ruby. - You gonna say hi, huh? - Good dog. We have a... pretty much a signed shrine to Kristin in our shop with every time she came home, got our wall signed, and it's pretty fun. Yeah, write little notes on the walls. Yeah. Whenever I got back from the war, or I got back from deployments, we would get bottles of Jagermeister, it was tradition, so we'd each get a bottle of Jagermeister and finish it between like the two, or three, or four of us. We had more than four people, too. Yeah, sometimes... sometimes we'd have five people, sometimes we'd have... Oh, gosh, whoever showed up. Well, we're pretty much family. Yeah. Aww. Thank you. There was a lot of deployments, so I came back a lot. We're just glad he came back. - Right? - Aww. Thanks. Roof team, rooftop building three. I heard a story about him. He's going through caves, and the Navy SEALs were scared, and alls he wanted to do is he wanted to die, he didn't care, he didn't... He didn't like who he was. So he... he'd run right through there locked and loaded, and just go, just run straight like a nut. I don't understand why he's still alive. I mean the shit he's been through... unbelievable. Always balls to the wall, you might say. Always really pushing it to the extreme, everything, and we're very proud. It's hard to take things from your own kid at their word, but when you see it in print it's very different. Then your eyes are opened, you say, wow, he did that? He's got all kinds of commendations. It was outstanding some of the things that he's done and accomplished, and nobody can take that away from him. That's his, maybe not only, legacy that he'll leave behind. Where he's going now, I don't know, only time will tell how that will be judged in another 20 years. Glad she's not going to war anymore, but this is... a little scarier. You go on the web page and read some of the things that people write on there, and it's just... another war to fight, really. I get a lot of this hate mail, and I get a lot of people posting very derogatory things. And it goes way beyond hate, sometimes they're death threats. "Wow, this man needs mental help. He has brought shame and dishonor to a proud organization. The only thing more sickening than this is the morally bankrupt and useful idiots showering this person with accolades." "Okay, so it came out, now go back in. You are ugly." "Good job promoting liberal brainwashing of our nation, now more and more kids will grow up confused. Enjoy your stay in hell." In some ways, this is worse than what I did on a physical battlefield. This is like... like right up in your face, and sometimes it's from friends. It's like that entire career didn't mean anything. It's tough. We are learning more tonight about the murder of a transgender woman in Oakland over the weekend. Sasha was set on fire Monday. The 18-year-old victim was wearing a skirt at the time. Gutierrez ID's herself as transgender, and claims this fight was her taking a stand against bullies. There needs to be a change, a fundamental change and compassion in our country. I've seen so much of this pain, and so much of this bullying, and it's not right. I'm a human being. I deserve dignity and respect. I hope that maybe we could start learning to love each other and have more compassion, and understanding for the diversity of human beings. It would be a really sucky world if we were all the same. I'm glad I'm different. So how you doing? - Pretty good. - Yeah? It's been real busy. So, just trying to live life, you know. You been helping him out? Helping her out? Yeah, I'm trying. A lot... a lot of organization and just emails. I have thousands and thousands of emails. There's so many people in the world that never found it in themselves to do what they wanted to do, and they saw the Anderson Cooper special and they're, like, you had the courage, you did this, and you did that, and so people just saw that. Now, they're sending me emails, and I just... I can't keep up. They're using you as their outlet. I just warn you against that, you know, you gotta... what was your prime objective, take care of you or others, you know? Me, I guess. And until you get on a level playing field, and your strength is built up, I just caution you about putting too much time into that because you're... you're weak, and they need someone that's strong. My dad gave me some similar advice, but he's still kind of... he has a lot of problems with everything I'm doing, so... Well, naturally. I mean, any parent would. You don't have any kids, so it's hard to put... - I have two boys. - Oh, do you? That is my hardest struggle right now, is what I could do with my kids, or about my kids. Right, you're still their parent. I know. - Right, so... - That's the hardest part. You wear a lot of shirts. Yeah, I'm on the road a lot, it sucks. Usually, it's our own choice that keeps us from coming home and visiting, and things like that. There's a cost to that. And with respect to your children, you know, are you gonna be a rock for them, too, you know, which is hard because they may not even wanna talk to you, or maybe they do, I don't know the situation. They don't really want to talk too much. Yeah, you got a lot of... a lot of emotions. That's why I said be careful. There's always, like, the American dream to have, you know, the wife and the 2.3 kids, and a picket fence, and it was just something that you grew up with. There he goes on the cement. First one to walk on the new cement. I was just trying to fit in to the stereotype American dream, exactly what my parents and everyone expected of me. And I met someone who's... who's awesome, you know, we got along good. We were hiking, and biking, and you know, doing all kinds of cool stuff, you know. And so, we ended up, you know, together. And then, we had kids. She knew about this, like, way after we were married. You know, you bring it out just slowly and then see what the acceptance level is, and she wasn't totally digging it. So, she had no idea what she was getting into. Definitely wasn't the top on her list of things that she wanted, so it hurt. And she was so good, and I never saw it. It sucks. I wish I could've done a lot better. I want my hair to be as long as yours. Yours looks cool. - You just have to grow it out. - I'm trying. It takes a long time. So, this is the house Chris grew up most of his... you know, his later years, high school, I believe. And then I married his youngest sister, and then we bought the house from Chris' parents. Do you want to see her room? Yeah. You gonna show it to me? You said you put all of the stuffed animals out of your dad's room finally? I have one daughter, Ella. She actually likes this version of him a little bit better. - Why do you think that is? - 'Cause he's... he... he can relate to her better. That's what she's told me, she relates to him better. Look how awesome this room is. And a huge closet now. You get a professional painter in here or did you do this? Professional painter. - 'Cause it's really nice lines. - Yeah. She loves it. This little, tiny closet right here, there's a really small, little mini closet. That's where my sisters used to stash, like, a lot of the old clothes, and just stuff that they would never wear. So, I would stash my clothes in there of my girl clothes that I would kind of sneak around, so I would have girl clothes stashed in there that I would wear. - Oh, okay. - So, that was my hiding place, like, where my sisters' clothes were. So, the first time I felt this feeling that I can remember, was somewhere like... it was third or fourth grade, or something in grade school. I had a hiding place, and I had like a couple of my sister's things, like a skirt, or something. I remember purposely staying home sick, so I'd fake sick the fever and stomachache and all that, my mom would go off to work, and my dad was gone, all the other kids were in school, I had the whole house to myself. And I would put nail polish on, I could have, you know, a pair of my sister's shoes on. It was like a reset, it was like a vacation for me. So, I had my vacation away from Chris. I was isolated from everybody. You know, my parents, my brother, and my sisters, and I don't think anybody really knew me. I just kind of always closed up. All of this trapped and closing all this up just kind of made me close everything else out. Chris. The first ones to know in my family about any of this, were my sisters. That was a little bit of a process, you know, checking, and feeling it out. And then they came to kind of figure it out, understand it and accept it. Never told my mom or my dad or my brother. Chris. Good wood barrel, too. I had no clue. I don't know if it happened in the service. He says I don't know, from what I hear, you know, it started out early. I never saw it. It's the Chris dude. We used to have fun, we used to fight, I blackened his eye, you know what I mean, we were brothers. But I never saw the... a girly in him, you know what I'm saying, a... a dress. I don't know. Do it, do it, do it. Come on...! See, for 40 years, I know my son as... as a male. It's cold! I mean I... I... you see, I never saw... I never saw this coming. He was a decorated U.S. Navy SEAL with ties to Northern Virginia. But now he has publicly come out as a woman. When he went viral, I mean, it kind of shocks you. But we kind of knew a little bit, but we didn't want to talk about it, you know, especially me and my dad, you know. But the girls, I mean... I mean women, you guys are cool with whatever, you know, especially if, you know, some women think he's hot. Everybody wanted to keep it from me, they thought I'd go bonkers when this whole thing broke. And I had a hard time because he was pushing so hard at it. Spread the word, we're here, and we're beautiful. He was upset, he didn't understand it, it's all new, and so my father's been working on this now in his own mind for eight months. And he's come around pretty far. What's gonna happen for dinner? I'm not a cook. I'm gonna do... I'm gonna cook my special spaghetti. - Right. - Is that okay? Yeah. That's cool. Very cool. Can you do me a favor? Can you pull my boot off? Just the boot, not the foot. Got it. You were pulling my whole foot. Thanks, Dad. I can do everything else. I know in the beginning, to gain acceptance of this was very hard. And... and... but it's happening. This is not something that's gonna go away. It's become a vital part of his life. Me and my dad playing golf. This is only the second time I've ever played the game, and... He's doing... he's doing amazingly well. He's the same. Just dresses different. - There. - Jesus criminies, you sombitch. It's on the green. I still call him Kris, short for Kristin, you know. I love him, he's cool. My mother's reaction... Oh, my gosh. "Well, it's just a phase, you're gonna be over it, and maybe it's a reaction to the war, and all your things that you've gone through, and this is just the way you're coping with it. And it's gonna be a phase, you're gonna be over it." That's pretty much where she's leaving it. You know, the only comment she says was, "Christopher, I just don't understand this. Why couldn't you be normal and just be gay?" And I was like, Mom, who says that? I need a strong man in the house to open up this thing. Oh, I got it. We're gonna wait for your brother or no? No, 'cause he might be like another hour. It is a big thing to be accepted, and I can understand that. Even though you might have a thousand people out around you that look up to you and feed on what you're doing, a lot of times, it comes back to family. Is my family gonna accept me or reject me? Bless us, oh Lord, and these Thy gifts we are about to receive from Thy bounty through Christ our Lord, Amen. (all) Amen! - Is that butter? Do you have garlic sauce on it? - I'm trying to. Do you know your mom's nickname was Bean when she was growing up? I knew that, but I never knew why. Bean. You all had nicknames. Chris hated when I called him Miss Chris or Chrissy, Kissy. No. Kiss. He still doesn't like it. She, excuse me. That might be the first time you ever said she. I think that's the first time you ever did that. That was kind of nice. Thanks, Dad. You're welcome. I'm gonna cry. You know, I feel... I love to see Kristin so happy right now. I love it. What a huge load to take off. I mean I... I feel so sad that she had to have that growing up, that pain, so just happy now that she can be happy. So nice to see you relaxed. I think it's... Family and just nice and... Mellow. Quiet. It's good. I like it. I wish mom was here. My Icy Hot patch. It seems like it helps. It might be more psychological than it is, but... Ow! physical, it just totally went out. I've gotten a lot of injuries, you know, in 20 years in the SEAL teams. I broke this elbow, and I broke my back, and this shoulder, and that knee, and that ankle, and both my wrists, and almost all my fingers, ribs, and... I mean, I have stuff all over that I've definitely messed up. But I'm still really lucky. There's a lot of guys coming back, and they're missing arms, and legs, and just really messed up. And there's young kids coming back that were teenagers when they went overseas to the war, and they're coming back with some scars that you won't... you won't see on the surface. I have pretty minor injuries compared to a lot of those guys. Need any help? Not really, unless you want to carry me down the stairs. Do you want to carry me down the stairs? No, but I can get you a cane. Yeah. Or I could slide you in a pillowcase. No. Actually it feels a lot better. - It feels better already. - Okay. I think I'm healing up. All right. At least my back hasn't gone out. You don't become a Navy SEAL and then just drop out and become a normal life. It does scar you in certain ways. It... it has to. If you're any kind of a thinking, rational, empathetic human being, it's gonna leave scars. So, I'm getting ready to drive out of here. So, I've got Bo, and I was walking around my dad's house thinking about all the stuff that I had. I only had a few things stashed here. And I'm looking at the chairs, I'm looking at the TV, I'm looking at the books, and just looking at all the stuff. Just a normal life... Little town, little house. All the stuff that I don't have, or I probably never will have. I'm back on the road. But no matter what happens from now on with Chris, I told him you're blood of my blood, black, blue, brown, I don't care what you are. You know, you're my kid, and I would never turn my back on you. But I'd like to see him settle down, and maybe find a good companion. He hasn't, at this time, been able to settle with anyone, and I think we all need someone, you know, that you can share... you know, share the journey. I think they see me limping, and they see that inner turmoil, and they tell me to take care of myself. I'm gonna take their advice, I'm gonna start trying to look out for myself a little bit more... For a day. Then I'll go back to my old ways, beating myself up. So I'm at VMI, Virginia Military Institute. I was the class of '88, so we had our 25th reunion. Going to the football game, the game I was gonna win. It's the first time I've been back here to this school in at least 15 years, you know, since the war started in September, you know, 2001, I've been kind of busy. I bought this special just for this event. You gotta stand up for the American flag. So a Navy girl, I was a Navy boy. Now I'm a Navy girl, retired. Well, nice to meet you. Also I'm back here now as Kristin, so it's a lot of people for the first time are kind of seeing me. - What's up, Steve? - Hey, how are you? - What's going on? - Good to see you. - How's it going? - How you doing? - Pretty good. - Good. - You're down in Florida? - I'm in Florida right now, but I'm kind of traveling around the country going up and down the east coast. I've been following you on the Facebook. - Oh, yeah? Cool. - Yeah. I've met a lot of my old friends, they're still here, and most of them said, if this is what you have to do, and it makes you happy, then I support you. Many of them said they don't understand it, but I don't understand it, but I support you. I think is a great way to go. It's not full support, but it's not a punch in the face. You all understand that some of us need to have a little different journey. That's what we defend. That's what all these young men right here defend. During the football game, people that are here for their first year, they're called Rats. The entire game, they have to stand the whole time. And every time VMI scores a touchdown, they run down into the end zone, and they do push-ups in the end zone. So, it's traditions. It's good stuff. ...15, 16, 17... Hey, just checking in to see how you guys are doing. How are the kids doing? I have two boys, and they were born just before 9/11, you know, right in that time period. I was deployed a lot. I was constantly gone. I mean, I had one year I was gone 340 days or something. At that time in my life, the only time I was happy was when I was overseas. I wanted to be gone. It was easier for me 'cause I knew I could just live that one thing, I could live the SEAL. So, none of this was even a thought 'cause you were living so hardcore that nothing else really mattered or crept up, including family. What is that? Legos? You got Lego dinosaurs? I was looking at, like, the life insurance for my boys, and I just figured that maybe that was the best thing I could give them. And the kids wanted, you know, maybe they just wanted me to be there, and I was never really there. So, am I gonna be able to come up and visit some day? I don't know. Whatever's easy for you guys. Even when I was there, I wasn't really there. I was the angry, bearded Viking, you know, punching walls, and the only way I could sleep was I'd have to, you know, drink a bunch of booze, and knock myself out. All the time I was even there, they were living on eggshells. They were always worried about everything they said, everything they did 'cause I was so wound up, I was so tight. Okay, I'm done. And I look back on that, and I'm going man, yeah, that's what I was doing, I was such an asshole. It's very difficult for everyone in the military to just jump from a routine overseas, your friends are dying around you, and then you're suddenly, the next day, you're on an airplane and you're... you're back home. Just hard to adjust. Well, tell them I said hi. Yeah, I heard you ask if you wanted to talk. Just say hey to the kids. Tell them I love them. Yeah. Thanks. Bye. They're so unhappy, and I think I did it to them. I don't know if I did it to them or not, but I feel like I did. I hope I didn't. It's not like the movies, it's not always a happy ending. I couldn't sleep last night. Why? I don't know. I just can't sleep sometimes. I just lay awake all night, and... just... I don't know. I have bad dreams, too, so it doesn't help. I don't sleep. Some nights, I won't sleep for like three or four days. I just lay around, just lay awake and think of stuff. I think it's probably pretty common for all the guys that go overseas, and you just... you think about a lot of stuff. Breakfast. I moved out of this really nice house, so if you see the interview with Anderson Cooper, it's got a really nice fireplace and house, and the perfect wood floors, and I couldn't have that... a house and this. So I moved out, everything was packed up and just stuck in here, I jumped in the RV and took off. I need to get electricity hooked up, and my water turned on. It feels like I'm camping every day. In the service, we're constantly going from place to place, and you're always living out of bags, it's so aggravating. It kind of brings me back to some of those times. So, a little bit of sacrifice for me, and hopefully I can have something nice one of these days. I have a few friends that came back from the war, they're in wheelchairs. That's what I wanted to do, is I wanted to have a landscaping business that could help these guys out. So we'd have lawnmowers and plant some trees, and beautify their yard a little bit, so that when they're drinking their coffee in the morning, they're not looking at the desert, or they're not looking at a battleground. They should be looking at a healing ground. I found a piece of property in Florida. It was 5,000 square feet of greenhouse, but it was foreclosed, and it's been vacant, so it's all overgrown, it was like a jungle. Healing Grounds... We have property. For anyone that runs a non-profit, or like really gets it going, you know, more power to you. It's hard. It really takes a lot out of you. Ow! This helmet is an Iraqi soldier's helmet. So, I think it looks nicer with flowers in it. Here, let me pull the truck out, then you guys can... I think we're right there, so if you wanna just pull straight out, - and then I'll back right in. - You're gonna move right up to it? There's a lot of work. So, you do concrete, so you're gonna like this. This is gonna be the new koi pond. And this area will be where all the plants, and all the other stuff are. This is gonna be the deep, really clean water in this, and this is gonna be a disappearing edge flowing up that way, and then in here, and then the co-op greenhouse on that side. This will be a sitting area right here for the restaurant. Right now, I've got, like, a junkyard, guys, that are using that piece of property, and then a thrift store is being run by another lady. And then all this will be the regular greenhouse, and then all these bases right here, see these little cubicles, they're like garage spaces, all these are gonna be for the artists. Are you doing a coffee shop or...? Yeah. What I want to try to do is have some veterans down here working, and then grow in these plants for the public. Less is more. Things get too big, they get away from you. This is too big. You'll get it down to a science. - I hope so. This is huge. - Yeah. There'll be another wall right here, and I was gonna start forming that in today, maybe. All through high school, I worked for a construction company, and I've always been kind of handy just building stuff. - My dad's an architect. - That's awesome. So, you learned some good skills then. No, I don't really speak to him much, he's gay. - Oh, really? - I don't speak to him. That's a bummer. I don't really speak to my kids a whole lot anymore. - You got kids? - Yeah, two boys. - Were you married? - Yup, for nine years. They know about... Are you gay? Or you like women? I'm transgender. What does that mean? Do you like women? I like people. So, but are you more attracted to women or men? I'm attracted to a person who... - All inside? - ...fulfills me, yeah. - Do your kids get that? - I'm not really worried about... what their organs on the outside. I care more about the people. - Do your kids get that? - Nah. Is that why you guys don't have a relationship? Nah. I haven't really talked to them about that much in depth. It's hard to explain. People ask me about that, they say I don't really understand transgender, you know, can you explain it to me? And the only thing I can tell them is I don't... I don't really know what transgender is either. You know, I don't know... I mean I know what it is, it's this, but I don't know like where it comes from or why. It's not an environmental thing that was pushed on me, or some food I ate that suddenly I broke out with transgender. It doesn't... I'm not a gay man, I'm not a drag queen, I am not maybe total dude, and I'm not total feminine, I'm not totally female. I'm not really... I think I'm living more in that gray world. And I'm still trying to figure it out. And maybe that's what everybody else is trying to do, too, they're trying to figure me out. 'Cause they're like, "I don't know what that is," which is kind of derogatory, but people are trying to figure it out. It took me a long time to get to this point, where I'm comfortable living in my own skin. And I'm very comfortable living the way I'm living right now because it's natural to me now, and I've never had that. So, in 2010, I was going out to the bars, I was getting dressed up. I had went out, and I bought a wig, and it was like this 25-, 30-dollar wig. It looked like a scarecrow. It was not nice. And then the makeup, I didn't really know how to do the makeup, so I jump in my car, and I drive down to the bar, and the only bar I can go to that I would be safe enough at was a gay bar right down here in St. Pete. You know, a couple people are just like... they're somewhat friendly, and some of them are just looking and going, "Okay, wow that makeup really needs some help." And so it was more like, "Wow, look at that style, it's not very nice." And I was like, I didn't know. I don't know how to put makeup on. I didn't grow up that way. I didn't have my mom or my sisters, I didn't grow up with it when I was a teenager, I was terrible at makeup, and I knew it. And to have gone from the house, and being so ill-prepared, and so like... and all alone, by myself, I had no backup. So, there's no predator flying over, there's no helicopters, there's no rescue team, there was nobody to help me. So, I was 100% all alone, and totally unprepared. That's why it was worse than going into like a mission in combat, 'cause I had nothing. I was all... I was hanging totally out by myself. And the rest of the LGB community, just does not understand that because they can just put on whatever outfit they wear everyday. And I get made fun of even in my ...community. You look silly. Why would a guy wear a dress? That's why it's harder than some of the missions I went on. It really was. Can you stack these over here, so it's way out of the way? Yeah, all the stuff that is obviously junk we're gonna chuck. There's another mouse right behind you. There he is. Hey, buddy. Hey. - Are you scared of mice? - Not really. Yeah, you are. I just try to leave them alone. Wait, you're in the Marine Corps, you're not supposed to be scared of anything. On paper, maybe. On paper? Keys, keys, keys, keys. Come on, keys. Where are the keys? I don't know where my freaking keys are. Can't even move that truck. And I've checked in the truck. I've looked in every freaking thing that it could have been, so now, I have to start looking in the not-obvious places. So, here's a bunch of my flags. I'd write on them the base I was at. So, this was at Fort Operating Base Chapman in Afghanistan. That's when I got blown up, got hit by some shrapnel, and I got... in 2008, purple heart that day. I got a birthday present from Taliban. It was kind of a messed up birthday, I guess. Still ready to rock 'n roll. Draw your pistol, take a shot. Nobody will ever yell at you for being tactical. That was my first platoon right here, so '91, '92 was my first year. Full sweep. SEAL Team One was predominantly working in the Far East, Australia, and a few other places. Indonesia, Malaysia, Serbia, Thailand. So, different teams specializing in locations, but they're all pretty much equal as far as capabilities. 25 volt, all right. I was doing some groundbreaking stuff with the UAV's, making them fly longer, and doing different missions with them, and different tactics, and developing things. This is me in Iraq with a golden AK at Uday Hussein's palace. This is where those huge swords are that you always see with the huge parade field with all the troops marching through. Here I am on top of Saddam Hussein's palace in Baghdad. This is what they call a green zone now, but when we were there, it wasn't green, it was pretty red. Saddam's throne. I couldn't believe the amount of excess. So, this is when I sat on Saddam's throne. Ha! This is Afghanistan. I started doing source operations, and that's working with the locals. I met a lot of the old Mujahideen commanders. This is me just dressed in the uniform they wear all the time. Here on the gun, this little tiny green guy my youngest son made that for me, so I'd carry him on all my missions. I used to make a lot of pottery, so that's one of my pots. What's that thing you got it wrapped up in? Oh, some guy's scarf that he didn't need anymore. I've been looking for these damn keys for a freaking hour, man. And they're... This freaking stupid bag pushed them to the back, couldn't even see 'em. Man. Found the keys! When I first started going out in public, I'd only go out at night. I never spoke about my profession, I was always fearful of running into a workmate or somebody, and so I went to very obscure places. I got the bar, August of '69. That's when Kerouac was coming in here. We didn't know he was a real famous writer at the time, he... he just said when I'm not partying or drinking I try to write once in a while, so... So when I first walked in here, I thought I was gonna get beat up. I had pretty much the whole bar staring at me. They were just looking, and they were like, what the fuck? and the owner of the bar, Dale, came over, started talking to me. When she first came in here she was on the TV show I'd caught a glimpse of. My friend, Boone, he had watched the whole show, he recognized her. I saw her on... on the TV, on CNN, and then she pop in here, saying that, who you are that Kristina... No, Christine used to be Christopher, right? Now Christine, and you've been a good friend. Once a month all the Air America, the guys that flew in Vietnam... Every Wednesday of the month. - Every Wednesday? - They over there meeting. And they made it his restaurant, reminisce about the old days. When I have friends like this, it's very strange to them, but after they find out what I'm up to, and they find out that, hey, I'm just a regular human being, maybe the next time they see somebody, it's a little different. They're gonna give them a chance. There's a lot of people here at this bar now, who are way more open-minded than they were ever before because they gave me a chance. If somebody gave me a gun-shaped pool stick, I'd probably be better. She's a free spirit, she's doing what she wants to do, served her country, and she's a true American. - Yes? - Can I buy you a drink? Yes. How are you doing? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Respectfully, a lot of the SEAL Team guys that I'm friends with, they were saying, "Man, if this is a joke, it's a really bad joke, it's not very cool." I said, "No, it's not a joke. This is me." One of the coolest things one of the real old-timers from my old team said, "I've known Chris for 20 years, and that sister is my brother." So, once a SEAL always a SEAL. So, we're on some really skinny stairs, and that's where you just gotta make due... just gotta make due with the fact that we're gonna be really in here skinny, and almost one on one, at this point. The stairs and the shift, and this is the way we're gonna be moving, at this point like this. Okay? After all that training, you run into a lot of the same breed. The stereotypes sometimes work. Hey, you ready, princess? Holy shit. All right, let's go. My name is Travis Lively, spent 10 years in the Navy, most of that as a Navy SEAL here on the west coast at the same time that Chris was stationed on the west coast. This range, in particular, out here, we have 270-degree field of fire, so we're gonna be able to shoot in three directions. It's fantastic. I ended up giving Kristin a call, and I was like, here's the deal, this whole thing that you're doing... I get it, and I'm cool with it, you know, like, I want you to be happy. I'm here for any team guy, or team girl. We were doing a little shooting out on the range with some buddies. I'm not doing, like, a lot of shooting myself. Most of the time I'm doing training, I'm just showing other people how to shoot, or fine tuning skills for some police officers or SWAT teams, things like that. Hold it kind of low, controlled right here, you know, almost like the retention, weapon retention, and just go right in there and start blasting. A real gun fight when you're out there trying to do something, I noticed this with SWAT, police, when I'm working with any of those guys they're doing that, I'm working with them trying to get very kind of accurate in the beginning, but real fast. - Thanks, Travis. - Yup. Trying to get real fast and get on there with something. If I hit them in the foot, it's a good shot. So the thing is, both eyes open, and you're pulling your pistol out, and immediately after I'm out of the holster, I want to be on, even when I'm right here, I'm hitting a target, I'm hitting, hitting, hitting, hitting. Now, I'm starting to get real accurate, now I might be... now I'm getting tighter on her. But I've already hit the guy three times from here, I've already hit him three or four times on the way up right to there. So, that's all it's about. First two shots, hit something. A foot shot is a good shot. I've known about this side for about three years, we've been friends for 16 years, give or take. Front site, front site, front site, pull it... - Got it? - Yeah. She asked me if she could basically confess something, I don't know, for lack of a better term, and he excused himself, and about ten minutes later Kristin walked out the door. And I was like, cool, great costume, or whatever. And she proceeded to explain to me that that's what she felt she was. It was a shock. Booze, let's go. Chris Beck, awesome to party with, you know, total life of the party. We've partied down in Tampa, we've partied in San Diego. Put alcohol in him he was good to go, but when he was sober, yeah, he was a pain in the ass. Look at that mean look. Holy Toledo. He did a lot of things that were on the verge of suicidal. You know, trying to hide under this mask of bravado. And Mr. Beck. Get that fucking camera out of my face! Putting himself in harm's way, going on voluntary deployments consistently. He only had to go so many times, but he did, what, 14, something like that? That, to me, is almost suicidal. The lone gunman. Tower guy. I'm just sitting here relaxing. Well, you're getting filmed while you're relaxing. You could tell there was something, an extra weight on this individual, there was an extra variable there that they were wrestling with the whole time. But I get it now. Okay. And I will say that Kristin Beck is still a pain in the ass, but definitely much easier to deal with because I think Kris is more comfortable with herself than she was as himself. Go, go! I got an out, I got an out! Get out of there! Go, go, go! Out, out, out. Cease fire. The person I see today is a happy person, especially in this element. Kristin's showing her capabilities, and what she did in the past, and that she can still do it. Even in those silly shoes. Because of how I'm starting to treat myself, and I'm starting to like myself maybe that relieved a little bit of the anger that I had. - Going hot. - Go hot. And it's hard to be like a tough guy when you have, like, a skirt on and high heels. So, it kinda helps a little bit if the outside changes. I see myself as a better person because I like myself better. I'm trying to treat myself better, and I want to treat everybody better. Whenever anyone asks me where I'm from, or where my hometown is, I tell them San Diego. I was here for 12 years in the Navy, SEAL Team One for most of it. And it seems like where I live right now, I have people that I know, and I have acquaintances, but I don't have, like, friends like this. Getting back on the gun today and running around was a blast. - Yeah. - It was like riding a bike. It was almost like being back... One more day like that, I could almost be back to where I used to be. Yeah, up the ante, though, next time, and do it with automatic weapons. We just want to kind of welcome Kristin back to San Diego. The kids just love her, so wanted to have her be able to see the kids again, stuff like that, and just hang out and give her a little down time. I've spoken to Kristin about reconnecting with her kids. What happened in that relationship which... has caused all this separation, I don't think it has anything to do with high heels, lipstick, and makeup. I don't think it has anything to do with those things. I think it happened long before that. Jyl and I have been married almost 11 years. I've been gone for a little more than half of that. Even now, I do a lot of international travel, and I'll be gone for a couple weeks at a time, and the kids notice even when you're gone for a couple weeks. Kenny, are you gonna share or what? Not in the conversation. Hey, are you done whining? Are you done whining? Yes. Well, go take them back, go take them back, go. All these pillows and everything you see is mine. Hey, do you want to go to your room? She has two kids, and I want to say they're 11 and 12, or 12 and 13 now, which is a really tough age, too. She's talked to me about it before. I think she kind of regrets that she didn't spend the time with them that she could've when they were younger, and you just... I think she feels that door is closed. She's expressed that she loves being around my kids, but sometimes, it really makes her sad, too. Look at what you're doing. You're so funny. What are we gonna look at? I always felt kind of like a visitor in places like this. I do need to try to have a home, and I'm looking at it, and I feel like I'm missing a lot out of life because I've been so loose, or so... unattached. I firmly believe that you have to do yourself before you can do for others. But at this stage of our lives, we're supposed to have all that figured out. It's time for us to provide for our children. I understand these are extraordinary circumstances, so as far as I'm concerned, I'm giving her a pass for about a year to sort your shit out. And then you have no excuse, but to go turn back to those kids. You get sort of wrapped up in your own life, how do you start over? How do you hit that reset button? I'm glad that, you know, my two boys are... are alive, so, you know, at least I did that right. They're here. They're pretty awesome kids. Okay, Wes, here it is. These guys are doing 15 to 20 minutes each swim, so this is times that, so that's like an hour in the water. Correct. We're gonna have zero way to do this closed circuit without them being SEALs. So, I'm gonna be hiring SEALs to do it. I joined the Navy in 1994, went to SEAL training and spent my whole career at SEAL Team One. And that's where I met Chris for the first time, and we've been friends and associates in a business relationship recently ever since. - You know how to measure to the inside of the deal here? - Yup. Okay, we're gonna measure that at exactly eight inches. Eight inches is this big? That's what I've been telling my wife is eight inches. So, I'm still working as a contractor. I'm building some different things for the Department of Defense. I invent stuff and think of stuff. International man of... woman of mystery. Yeah, I'm an international woman of mystery. I'm working on a little project, and it should be pretty neat. It's... it's an underwater project that I can't really talk too much about. This thing may be just an absolute pile of control surface. So, when we do that testing... We'll just hook it up. All the way through my entire military career I was kind of on the edge of technology. I've invented a couple things within the Department of Defense. I was very involved in that. So 15, 20 foot there, and I think we can do that with that one yellow line. - Okay, cool. - It's easy. It's all testing stuff, so as soon as we get the stuff tested, then we can try them in the water. Yeah, that sounds good. During his last couple tours, Chris did do a tour what people know as SEAL Team Six, what we call Dev Group, or development group, and then went on to the United States Special Operations Command in the research and development department. Really, it's supposed to identify emerging technologies that can be leveraged by... by the guys on the battlefield, and so it's a really critical role that he played. I mean, just a pretty amazing career by anyone's measurement. You're gonna find an awful lot of secrecy in anybody who takes their job real seriously, and probably no more so than the SEALs. And so, individual attention is rarely awesome. I know a lot of friends in my community don't want to be publicly supportive of Kris because it's bad for business. You're always gonna get a few people that have their views, and most of them, they won't express them because they're too afraid to come out. They'll talk big on a social media forum, but to actually come on camera and express their views I think speaks volumes for their character. But, you know, my only critical question to Kristin was, why would you want to create such a big deal about this in the media? At the end of the day, what I really want is Kris to be happy. I'm not positive that a documentary, magazine covers, or anything else is necessarily the path to that. Guys like Kris, girls like Kris, have taken the flag and have decided to start publicizing it, doing their part towards making it a better place. So, he's still fighting in that case because this would be a very easy thing to just do, and not publicize, taking the harder path for sure. I'll tell you what some team guys have said to me, like, I would love to talk to Kristin Beck, but the problem is if they support you, then they're... they're gonna face wrath from half the community. - Yeah. - Because they're pissed about, not the fact that you're transgender, but they're pissed about the fact that all unfolded. And the other part is if they... if they don't agree with it, for whatever their reasons are, and that's... that's their choice, and that's what we fought to defend - but if they don't agree with it, then they're gonna come across as... - Bigots and haters, and all this... - Yeah, homophobes, and... From their perspective, there's no win in this situation. The whole public thing, and even doing stuff that I'm doing right now, is that there needs to be a little bit of a public face to some of the things that we're going through as a nation. And if it has to be myself doing it, it's speaking from my experiences, and my upbringing, then why... I think it should be. The thing is, once you make that decision to cross that line into the media... all of a sudden, everybody's watching you. They feel that you kind of did them a disservice, in the sense that... And they don't even know what the right answer is either, but there was no heads up. That's the way the guys look at it. You're retired now, but guess what, you're always gonna be a team guy. I was at a breaking point, I was at that point where it was like, you know what... It's like rip the Band-Aid off. Yeah, it was worse than a Band-Aid. The doors came off the closet so fast, and I was just like... Okay... and I just kind of went with it. At that point, I had no choice. Again, you're now in a situation where you're loved or hated, but never ignored. Coming out and showing the world who I am... Nobody could understand what was going through my head, or going through my life, and say that there was a better way to do it. I kind of hit a wall, I hit a breaking point, I hit a spot in my life where I was no longer in the military, I was retired, I was still having that gnawing feeling like I am not doing what I need to do. And I was like, you know what, enough is enough, I'm just... I'm done, and I put on a dress and went to my work at the Pentagon. It was tough. It was tough on me. I think it was tougher on a lot of my friends and a lot of my co-workers 'cause they didn't know what to expect, and I... that was a mistake. I should've... I don't know how else I could've done it easier, I don't know how I could've done it different. I don't do anything halfway. It is with pleasure, and honor to introduce to you the real Kristin Beck. When I came out, I started getting phone calls from a lot of other organizations that they wanted me to come speak. So I do motivational speeches, and I do the anti-bullying thing, and working a little bit with the human rights campaign, and trying to work on people that they understand a bit more. One of my goals is to speak with people and tell them some of my story, but even more than me speaking with you speak to each other, seek each other out, help each other. I want to try to set a good example for our younger generation to say that being transgender is not bad - it's a facet of human life. And maybe I can give some people some hope that they didn't have before. This is my new armor. 'Cause of what I'm trying to represent. What I'm trying to represent is, you know, women being proud and beautiful and powerful and not to be taken lightly. So I am the underdog now, I am the weak, so if I can put my armor on, and portray myself as a woman with great dignity, great respect, and this armor protects me. Why did you decide to become a woman? That was not really my decision. It's like asking someone why did they decide to have blue eyes. What I did decide was to start living what I felt was more inside. We're all born very different, but as human beings, we are all equal. I mean, it's a birthright to have freedom and equality. My birthright is to... live a wonderful and happy life. That's all I was really asking for. And that's what I still strive for. Welcome to the San Diego LGBT Community Center. I was inducted into the LGBT Veterans Wall of Honor with a number of other people who have been defending, you know, this country, and... and the LGBT community. It's an honor, and thank you all. Final inductee tonight, great honor to present this award to Kristin Beck, United States Navy. She uses her personal narrative to influence policy changes. She advocates to legislators, and she pushes that they would allow people to serve open as transgender in the United States Military. Kristin. I'm humbled and honored in your presence. I look behind at this wall and see some of my fellow veterans that have been inducted. I'm honored for that. It really touches me greatly. And just like everyone... we keep talking about it over and over again, there's so much further to go. We're gonna get there. Please, go out and tell positive stories. That's what's gonna do it. We're gonna win people over one at a time. So, I'm gonna read this thing I wrote back in 2008, this is called "Everyone Prays." "I hear the helicopter's rotors beating the air, I smell the burning diesel fuel all around, the green glow of night vision goggles on the 18 guys sitting around me, the place we were going is enemy held, don't know if we're all coming home. The back ramp of the helicopter lowers down ready to dump its cargo. My head is bowed, and I'm saying my prayer, the same prayer I say every night before we go out death's door... God guide me, be with me, make me brave in the face of my enemy, bless my guys all around me, bring us home. If I don't make it, take care of them, take care of my two sons, give them the peace I never had. The helicopter banks hard, flares to a stop in mid-air. We run out in the desert night. The skies light up from tracer firing explosives. Just another mission." - Thank you. - Thanks. How you doing? Good to see you. - How's it going? - All right. The transgender community right now is not recognized under the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. They would be medically discharged, and that's a crying shame for them, for the military, and for taxpayers at large. You can't hire a sergeant off the street... You cannot, no. That experience is irreplaceable. Yes, Sir. And I'm really proud to be able to hear your story and that sort of stuff. Thank you. My husband wants to get a picture of us together. Yeah, definitely. What we value in the military is someone who is dedicated to the mission, and mission accomplishment. And I've heard Kristin Beck speak about the fact that this is another mission. And to see the talent that is needed for that, and to see it wasted because we can't adjust our own cultural thinking is a waste. And we as taxpayers lose that investment that we've put into that individual who would be willing to serve if they didn't have the prejudices that Don't Ask, Don't Tell brought. If he wasn't such a great person, it would've been a lot harder for me to accept, to be honest with you. It's unique for me. It opened my eyes because Chris was such a good friend, and a good person to me. Kristin is also 'cause that... that same person is still there. I think that there's a continuum, there's a... the gray area between genders is so much more vast than we could ever imagine. And I think that's because, when you look at the deep down, inside we are all the same. I'm tired of traveling. Maybe that would be part of my new life, part of starting over, that I could actually have a house somewhere, and have some friends... So, I think it would be nice to settle down a little bit. Merry Christmas, Dad, I love you. I had a lot of Christmases overseas. This year was especially hard. I tried to talk to the kids and say Merry Christmas, and the boys didn't want to talk to me on the phone. So I spoke to my ex-wife for a little while, and my Christmas was right here. My boys from six years ago. Do I want my kids to see this? Do I want my children to understand what my life is? Yes. I wish I could speak to them in person about half the stuff, but I don't know what to say. You know, the only thing I can say right now is sorry, and I would like to have a chance with them to share some of their life, if they would let me. Here it is. Right there on the pad. I'm starting to feel more empathy, more close to the emotional side of life that I never totally had before. This was a whole beach we used to use to do all the Marine Corps landing practices. Semper Fi. Deep in my soul, I can still say that this is the right path for me because there's still something in there that says I need to experience this. And so, that's why it's so hard to explain, and it's so difficult to put into words. It's like... someone who has never had sight in their entire life trying to explain the sunset. I don't think we can. But this is still a beautiful journey, and there's a great future ahead of me.
