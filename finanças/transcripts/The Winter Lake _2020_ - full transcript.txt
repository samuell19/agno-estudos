Tom!! Come away from there, it's dangerous! Hurry up! Where do you think you're going? You're supposed to be helping. Get this sorted. These are yours. - Yeah, well... - I sorted my stuff. This is your mess, Tom! Us being here is your mess! Do you think I like being back here living out of black bags? We were perfectly fine where we were until you. Do you want to be in your own? Turned in that way? Stop looking at me like that. - You hungry? - Hmm-hmm. Sit down there. What are you having? Eating in the morning slows me down. I need to go to town to get my single parent's. Have you seen the cutter? Tom? I haven't seen it. Stand up. Stand up, Tom. I said I haven't seen it! But you lie, don't you? You lie, you play with knives. You fuck everything up for me and I end up back here. Leave it where I can see it. The problem is the documents here say you've been living in the U.K. you have nothing to prove residency... I know, I've just made it back here. I need to get on the single parent's, that's right, isn't it? I understand what you're saying, but if you don't have your utility bill... I have no utility bill because I have no utilities. I don't even have a phone yet. But that's got to cover it. I've got those, I've got my ID. What's to commotion? Look, I'm on my own here. It's the girl that's moving into the old Matthew's mutton farm, granddaughter she is. What does that got to do with anything? - Is that so? - Please! Ah, we were all very sorry about what happened - to your granddad... - Get off me!! - Now, there's no call for... - Please... thanks!!! Fuck... Prick! No... Ah fuck!!! Hi! I think we live beside each other. Tom? Leave him, it's fine. No, it's fine. This is Ward, our neighbour. Glad to meet you, Tom! Tom is a little shy. Well, give it a good squeeze there, lad, hmm! He needs to eat his greens. Not sure... next time we'll do this for tea. Ah really, it's no trouble. Naw, we should be off. Well, see you soon, then. I'd have been lost without you! Bye! '...internal care of during pregnancy and after delivery.' Great! Did you get a good look yesterday? About what? That girl. No big deal, you know. It's only natural to think about getting your end away, cooped up in a place like this. What are you talking about? Just joking with ya. Can't you ever tell? You know the lake and fields? The dangerous one I told you stay away from? Yesterday, it was half empty. So, you listened to me then. Come here. Look, we're going to have to make a go of this. Being here. You don't have a lot of choice. So, I need you to help me out and not fight me on everything. Now, I tell you how things are, that's how they are, okay? Don't make me feel like I'm talking to myself. I need to hear you say it. Okay. Good. Now let's see if I can ask the neighbours for a lift into town. They'll be getting the car looked at. You're coming with me this time. You know we live like ten feet away for my neighbours in Leeds and they never even said "Boo!" to us. - Boo? - Honey... So, what were you at over there? Salon, off and on, doing nails. You picked the accent up anyway. It's every time we move. Now that we're back here, we're talking like muck savage, no offence! None taken. He can stay here if he wants. - It's all right, isn't it? - Quite so. Your mom works fast, doesn't she? And she's young. What was she when she had you, like twelve? Don't talk about her like that. Alright, whatever. He's not exactly a catch. He used to work at your place, you know. Just after he moved here. Doing fences. They all fell down. Didn't say he was any good at it. We didn't think the old guy on the farm had anyone. - What was he, your granddad? - Great-granddad. She really is young. You know he was lying there for weeks, before anybody knew he was dead. Nobody thought to check 'til the animals started starving in the fields. Guess they weren't close. You don't talk much, do you? That's okay. I like it. Who's that? Tom, this is Col. Col, this is Tom. Tom who? Tom next door. Where were you last night? This won't take long. What do you think? It's a big job, there's a few days in it. Pricey? Parts of it. Ah Jesus, hard to say without the parts. You'll give her a good deal, now Ferg. - I'll do it for cost. - You're a good man. He'll do it for cost. How's the peepin', Tom? Say nothing, yeah? Yeah, she works fast. That's what I say oh yeah. And take Holly with you, show her your collection. I'll say one thing for the old prick, he liked good whiskey. - Wait there. - What? Just wait. Okay, come in. What are you doing? What are you doing? Just having me own peek. So, do you like it here? It's okay, nobody does. What's the range on these things? Never tried them. Do we call each other? That, we can. You can see right into my room. I don't bite. Look. Window there. It's mine. See it? Well, now you know where I am. If you ever get lonely. I have to go. - Dad, I need to go. - What's wrong? I just need to go, come on... - Did she say something? - Did she have to? Aren't you just pissing a circle around me? Have you something to say or are you just going to stand there starring? You shouldn't take them together. That's a myth. Just go, I'm tired. - I just want to know... - Get out! Tom! Tom. Tom?? Hello? - Meet me at the turlach. - The what? - The lake. You don't know what a turlach is? That. Yeah. Elaine told me to stay away from it. Elaine? Well, she's right. It's dangerous. It goes up and down. Yeah. There's an underground river under this whole place. And it comes back up to the ground. And sometimes it fills up. Deep and then when it goes back down, it sucks things under. You can drown in it. I used to hear it in the back of my head, you know. I can hear it. They hear it too. It attracts them. Like a heartbeat. See? Did you ever cut one in two? No? The two parts just keep on going on their own. - Give it to me! - No! Be careful. It doesn't even hurt it, look. You said it wouldn't hurt it. Look, it's fine. See? Holly! Let's get out of here. Ward! Sorry, I was cleaning. Has Holly been here, she's not answering her phone. Come in, I'll check. Tom? - No sign. - I'll go look. Sorry, I just get worried when she's out with the lads. Tom? You don't need to worry. That isn't even on his radar. Still and all, could you call him? He hasn't a phone yet. Still trying to get on the scratcher. Listen, I'm probably the last person to be giving parenting advice, but I was a teenage girl, not that long ago. - Maybe just wait for them here. - Hmm. He's not that kind of boy, really isn't. So, where's your dad? Don't know. Ah, you're better off. Here, can you hold this? Thanks. You're not going to watch, are you? Did you ever get a crossbar from a girl. Let's go! I don't like not knowing where she is. Girls can get into trouble, can't they? They wouldn't tell their dads about it. You don't have to worry about Tom. You don't have to sit all the way over there either. Come and sit down, it'll be fine. I see her with those lads of the town. It's the way she is. She doesn't mean it. But they can't help themselves. I should go. You look out for her, don't you? It's my job, isn't it? It's only the two of us. She's not as grownup as she thinks she is. Hm. That sounds familiar. Can I ask about her mother? She wasn't interested. That sounds familiar too. Now, were better off. Sorry... You tell me to mind my own business. Right, mind your own business then. So, you'll wait around then? Just a while. If they're not back by dark, I'll take the van out. There's not a lot of men like you out there, you know. No? Ha ha... You know all the men in the world, do you? No. Just feels that way. The last one didn't end so well actually. It's kind of why we're here. There was a fight. I mean, there were lots of fights, but this one got physical. Just a bit, I mean a slap. And Tom went for him, got that knife thing he carries around - and slashed him. - Slashed him? Oh, it was just a scratch. Yeah, but you said he slashed him. No, no, he got the wrong end of the stick, it was - just a scratch. - Well, which was it? He gets things wrong sometimes. Get the time off her would ya? What? Get the time off her, would you. Sorry, do you have the time, please? - What? - Do you have the time, please? Sorry? You shouldn't bother me at all. Blow on it. Tom, we won! We won! Two teas. Can I then? No. It's the law. Thank you so much. Thanks. It's your winnings. What are you thinking? Nothing, I'm fine. That everything's fine? I'm not that cheery, you know. Sometimes, I need somebody to talk to. Do you? Do I what? Need somebody to talk to? Oh, I don't know. Sometimes, there's stuff inside you can't tell anyone. You know? Do you have that kind of stuff? Hold my hand. I know you found it. The baby. It's okay. Get off me! Tom? Tom? Please! Tom? Stop! You all right there, Hol? Babysitting again, eh? Get in, we'll give you a lift. You too if you want. Tom, please. Hey you! Is your mum the girl there up in the mutton place? Stop. I told you not now. - Really? - I said later, all right? Are you all right back there? Well, give me a puff then. Give him a jack for riding you back! Col... They all heard, what did you do to him, Holly? Do you think she's actually gonna give you some? Fucking weirdo. Are you deaf? Tom? Tom! Tom? - Tom? - Are you cracked? Did you hear me? Ah! Fuck! - He tore me this psycho! - What? He has a fucking knife! Look at my hand. - What the fuck is going on? - Fucking prick! Holly? Come on! Tom? Where have you been? Are you with Holly? Her dad's worried about her. Something happened? What's that? Is that blood, Tom? What did you do? Where is she? Answer me. Tom, Ward just wants to know that Holly's all right. What's this then? Is that yours? Is it hers? - She called. She called me. - Stop! Stop! Hey! Come back down here! - This is on you! - Ward, wait! We'll get this sorted! What the fuck, Tom? I swear to Christ, if you've done anything! - I don't care, I'll fuck him. - No, you won't. - Where were you? - Nowhere. - Who were you with? - No one. - You were with those lads. - Fuck off. Holly! Oh my God! What did you fucking say to me, huh? I know what you do with lads. You're a slut, aren't you? He found it. What? He found it. What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about. You said it went under. I thought it did. How could he have found it if you said it was gone? Huh? How can he have found it? Oh Jesus Christ... Don't go around, do you hear me? I'll deal with it. Thank you for coming. You don't understand. It was me. I just... I just wanted it to stop crying... until I knew what to do. Nobody even knew I had it so... I thought it'd get pulled under when the water went down. It would be liked it hadn't happened, you know? It wasn't Col... He's been coming into my room since I was eleven. You have to help me, Tom. Okay? You have to make him stop. It's the only way. Come on, please. Tom? What are you doing? - Soaking wet! - Yeah, I am. - Talk to me. - Get out. - I'm not going anywhere until we talk. - Get out! - Tom, is something wrong... - GET OUT!!! - Please! GET OUT!!! Tom? Tom, please... You can't leave me alone in this. Did I say you could stay? Can I just sit for a bit? You have no outside barters, have you? And that girl's not with you because I won't have her back here causing a ruckus. All right... But not all day, now. Have you seen Tom? No. Well as he called ya? - What? - On the walkie-talkie? - The what? - You're not in any trouble. What about your dad, is he home? Yeah, he's here. Could you get him for me please? Dad? I'm sorry about this, I just... What do you want? Could you give me a lift into town? I think Tom has run off. Please... - Have a yellow one. - I have no money. For God's sake, where are you going with no money? Don't know. Your mum's the Matthew's girl, up at the old mutton place, isn't she? Won't she be missing you? You need to be strong lad, to keep the place like that, - take it over. - I just make her feel worse. Teenagers, of course you do. I want to get away. It's better. Better for who? Your mom would be lost without you. I'll get you a cup of tea to go with that. Hurry up! Come here! In the back! The table, check under the table. Got him! - Stop! - Calm down. Calm down! Tom? Tom! - Get off me! - Get off him! Get away!!! Or what you slut! Back off, I mean it! Stupid bitch! You're fucking dead! Tom? Come on, let's go home. Tom? Give me your coat and I'll hang it up. Leave him alone. It's my fault. I just kept moving us around. And every time he gets worse. You know, I always promised I'd keep him with me, no matter what, I wouldn't ditch him like my parents did to me. Was I wrong? Sorry. You can't manage him on your own. There's no shame in that. There's just something up with his head. Can I get you a drink, huh? Where is it? I'm not a bad man, but I swear to God... Don't make me... Do you love your mum? She don't know. Well, I'll tell her and brake her neck. She don't know. What are you doing? I'm just checking on the lad. Did you put something in my drink? I'm just checking on the lad. Go on into bed, I'll be into ya. No... I think you should go. Right now. I'll be back tomorrow. To check on the both of you. Okay? Are you there? Holly, are you there? I'm here. I'll do it. Bring it with ya. What? It doesn't look so bad. It'll be gone soon. Shouldn't you be over there? After dark. He won't tell her, I'll put the fear of God into him. I believe you. You're my girl. I just want to keep you safe. I just want things to be all right between us. I know. When all this is over, we can go back to the way things were. It'll be all right. I'm so sorry, pet. Dad... You should go. Tom? I won't come in if you don't want me to. This isn't easy. Not for you either, I do know that. I know I'm a terrible mother. I'm not a terrible person. There isn't anything wrong with you, Tom. It's just... Things haven't gone right for us. And it's not your fault. I just put it all on you because I don't know what else to do. And I know I shouldn't do that. But I just... I fuck things up. I fuck everything up. So, what I'm asking is... Can we help each other out? Tom? Is that it? We don't have much time. Meet me by the turlach when it's over. I can't. You have to. He's on his way to your house right now. And if he doesn't find it there, he will hurt your mum. Unless I call him back and you do as you promised. Tom? Do you understand? Tom? What are you doing here? I'm sure I told you I'd be back to check on you and the lad. I just want to have a chat with him. You had a chat with him last night. I just want to talk. I think you should go. What? You got it. I won't keep you. Holly? Are you there, pet? Where is she? How did you get in here? She let me in. What have you done with the baby? She took it. - Let's go. - Are you sure... Do you want to come with me or not? Then drive. Bitch! Bitch! Tom? Get in! What did she tell you? I really don't know. That's his fucking mother! - Where is she? - I don't know. Ah that's a lie! Right, now I hurt you. Jesus Christ all mighty... You did this. You did this, you took her! Get off me! Let me go! You stay down there, do you hear me? Don't fucking move! Jesus, it's your dad. The emergency vehicles are on their way... Jesus Christ, Holly... Keep going. Keep going! - Keep going! - I'll see if they're all right. Do what you want, but I'm not ever coming back. Yeah... Where are you going? Where are you going? Dead! You're fucking dead! TOM!!!!! You made me do this! AAHHH!!!! AH!! God!!! Tom! Tom! AH! Please! Please, wake up! Wake up! Wake up... Over here! It's all right! I'm here. It's all right. I nearly lost you, didn't I? You don't have to say it. Let's go. Are you coming?
