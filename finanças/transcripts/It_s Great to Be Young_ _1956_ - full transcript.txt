Fellow teachers, scholars of the Angel Hill Grammar School... He's off. Today we reassemble once again for yet another term. Once more our little ship sets sail upon the sea of knowledge for yet one more voyage of discovery-- Yet today is an auspicious one for there is a new hand at the helm, a new face upon the bridge. In short, we embark today under a new captain. He's making me seasick. So without more ado, I welcome you all back to school and ask you to join with me in bidding welcome to our new headmaster... Mr. Frome. I take it we may now proceed without further accompaniment from the orchestra. Good. Now to business. First, I thank you all for your welcome. Second, I don't like making speeches and I'm equally sure that you don't like listening to them. Third, I ask you all to remember one thing. We are here to work, all of us. If you work well... we shall get on together. You may now dismiss to your classrooms. Dismiss. No talking! - What do you think, Ginger? - Hmm. I don't know. At least he doesn't go on spouting for hours which is something. We ought to give him a fair trial. - Go on, get off me! - Pack it up you twerps, pack it up. I think the new head has a sad face really. I bet you anything he's had a big tragedy in his life. Paulette, why you have to think everyone has a split personality? I don't know. - The head looks perfectly normal to me. - "Normal"? He's a headmaster, isn't he? I've never met a normal one yet. The principal powers concerned in the Congress of Vienna were England, Russia... Austria and France... France? - Yes, sir. I think so. - Well, think again Morris, think again. - What's this? - Brandy balls, sir. "Brandy balls"? Brandy balls! It is more blessed to give than to receive, my angel. Morris, have you thought? - Well-- - What is it? Was Beethoven alive at this time, sir? "Was Beethoven alive"? My dear child he was more alive than the rest of Europe put together. Riley! - Sir? - What do you remember of Wellington? Umm... boots, sir. Exactly, Wellington Boots. What do you remember of Beethoven, eh? Come on, Beethoven! Er... That's enough! I may look like an idiot, Paulette, but let me assure you I've got my wits about me. - Yes, sir. Of course sir. - "Yes sir. Of course sir." You think that you've only to mention music to me and I'll forget all about history, don't you? Oi! You, what's that? Knitting, sir. I know it's knitting, dear, I can see it's knitting. It couldn't possibly be anything else. What kind of knitting? Well sir, it's for a baby. A baby. Yes sir. My sister's. It's a very sweet thought, Peggy. A sweet and sisterly thought. Next time, why not bring the baby as well? After all, this is only a history lesson, isn't it? History really doesn't matter, does it? - No sir. - No. - I mean... yes, sir. - Beg pardon sir. That talk on the instruments of the orchestra has started. You asked me to remind you, sir. You too, Putnam? We'll stick to the Congress of Vienna... if you don't mind. Yes sir... Quiet! Quiet! Everyone stand still. While you are in the school buildings, you will do your utmost to disguise the fact that you are hooligans. Go back to your classrooms and come out again with some semblance of order and decency. Sorry, headmaster. Tea... If you don't get there quickly, the blighters pinch the lot! For Heaven's sake, give me a cup of tea. There's just enough if we squeeze the pot. - I've just had the shock of my life. - What's the matter, Harry? The new head's been going through the timetables. He's cut my first 11 practice right out. Right out! Can you imagine? About time too. This is a school, not a blessed football team. I still can't believe it. Do you know the fellow's got no idea of sport at all. No idea at all. - That makes two of us. - It does seem rather cruel. Don't suppose he's ever kicked a foot ball in his life, wouldn't know one if he saw it. Do come in, headmaster. I think we can manage a cup of tea. No, I won't, thank you. Oh, Mr. Dingle. You wanted me, headmaster? Yes. I wondered if we could have a session together after lunch. After lunch... Wait a minute now... er... Yes, that'll be all right. I've got a rehearsal of the orchestra then. Good chance for you to hear what they can do. Thank you. I'm sorry I interrupted your break. Oh by the way, Paterson, I believe I have seen a foot ball. As I remember it, it's a spherical leather case containing a rubber inner tube which is inflated by air and then sealed. Quite an ingenious device. The man's got a sense of humour. I'm going to like him! The academic subjects are the ones to be emphasized I think, don't you? Well I think there's too much emphasis on dates and facts and figures. That's what's wrong with modern schooling. Indeed. What does it really do to a kid to teach him about, say, the Congress of Vienna? It might give him a sense of the movement of history, don't you think? Movement be blowed. You know better than that. But give 'em music, teach 'em to appreciate sound... There's more real education in that than a dozen blooming Congresses. - Where's your hat, boy? - In... in me pocket, sir. In my pocket, in my pocket... not me. Yes sir, in your pocket, I mean, in-- - Wear it boy, wear it. - Yes sir. You know the school rules? Yes sir. Well now, take Beethoven for instance. Mr. Dingle, if we could leave your private theories on education aside for a moment... tell me about the School Orchestra. Well... er... I think you're going to be impressed. I think we've got the makings of a fine little orchestra. Mind you, we're short on wood and brass... very short. Quite. If I could get a horn, two trombones and a clarinet. Yes, yes. You concentrate on serious music, on the classics? Oh yes, exclusively, exclusively. Mind you, I like a spot of jazz myself, don't you? Personally I find it detestable.... In my view, it ruins character. Up, up! Up! Mr. Dingle. We can discuss this more easily tomorrow morning. Excuse me, sir... I... I'm sorry sir. Don't go. We were... just relaxing. If you'd give us a chance to play. - You're a prefect aren't you? - Yes sir. Your name? Putnam, sir. I expect my prefects to keep control in the absence of masters. I shall have something to say to you later... Putnam. Miserable old twerp. That will cost you 200 lines, Riley. Worth it. Then we'll make it 400. And I wanted you to make a good impression... And how many times do I have to tell you Putnam, you must stroke the notes out, not force them. You're playing a trumpet not blowing up paper bags. Excuse me, headmaster. I wanted to ask you whether someone could take my maths period this afternoon... I have to go to the-- Well done Putnam, jolly good. Ah there we are Riley. Sit down. Four hundred lines, wasn't it? Let's see if we can think of something interesting. "I must learn to keep my mouth shut then I shan't put my foot in it." Let's hope the thought does you some good. Three hundred lines you said, sir? Riley, Riley, Riley. Will you never learn? The actual figure was 500... goodnight. Goodnight, sir. Oh, clear off, you blokes. I've got to do 500 before I can go. That's what we're here for. Five hundred... There's ten of us, that's 50 a piece. Come on get cracking. But old Dingle'll know it's not my writing. He only ever looks at the first page. We'll shove yours on top. I believe that strong measures are necessary and I ask your full cooperation. Discipline must be tightened and there must be a much greater emphasis on the primary purpose of the school... study. Netball, cricket, football may be excellent pursuits, but they are secondary. The result of our last terms examinations was a disgrace. Until we do better, our other activities must be curtailed. Mr. Dingle. Yes? It had crossed my mind that we should disband the School Orchestra. Disband it? It crossed my mind I said. But perhaps that would be a bit too hasty. We will therefore merely limit its activities a little. In future, all rehearsals will be held outside of school hours and even those must not be allowed to interfere with homework. Are you all right Mr. Dingle? We don't want to lose you just yet. I thank you ladies and gentlemen for giving me your time and attention. The other measures I have in mind can be taken up later... good night. Just a minute, headmaster. I'd like to speak to you about the new instruments. - Instruments? - Yes. At the last staff meeting, it was more or less agreed that the school should buy some more instruments for the orchestra. - I want a tuba, two trombones-- - So I believe. I'm sorry Mr. Dingle, it's out of the question. - Mr. Frome! - Yes? You don't mean what you said about not buying the new instruments and rehearsals? I seldom if ever say what I don't mean, Mr. Dingle. But I've entered our orchestra for the National Festival of School Orchestras. Very commendable. I hope they do well. But you don't understand. We haven't got a chance-- I've no time to argue Mr. Dingle. And now if you would concentrate some of your undoubted energy on the rather duller academic subjects, we should all be most grateful to you. Goodnight. Go on Nicky. They're your favourites. I brought them specially. Thanks awfully, Paulette, but I don't feel like eating. I know. You ask me, Frome's an absolute Philistine. He wants his brains dusted. I spoke to my father too. He's sure he could get the instruments cheap. What's the use of discussing it? The Head's attitude is just too juvenile to be true. If it ain't the Upper Sixth sitting on their rear ends as usual. Oh, scram microbe or I'll crown you. And I suppose you big fellows will let him get away with it. Hop it young 'un, hop it. - Nicky you don't suppose... - Sh... Leave him be. The great man's thinking. Again we find Blake in his more questioning mood when he wrote... Tyger Tyger, burning bright In the forests of the night... You continue, Paulette. What immortal hand or eye Could frame thy fearful symmetry? Browning. What the hammer? What the chain? In what-- - Are you with us, Putnam? - Yes, sir. What subjects are we discussing? Drake, sir. Tell him, Marion. William Blake, sir. Precisely. No relation to the Admiral, my angel, none whatsoever! Now we all have the question of the orchestra on our minds, Putnam. But we mustn't let it get us down, must we? No sir. I was only wondering, sir. Would Mr. Frome object if we... found a way to raise the money and bought the instruments ourselves? I have no way of reading the headmaster's mind, Putnam. But I suppose if the money didn't come out of the school funds... Any ideas? - Not really, sir. - Then what are we wasting time for? Continue with the poem, Browning. What the hammer? What the chain? No, no, no, dear boy. We're reciting poetry not making puff pastry. Like this. What the hammer? What the chain? In what furnace was thy brain? What the anvil? What dread grasp? Dare its deadly terrors clasp? When the stars threw down their spears And watered heaven with their tears Did he smile his work to see? Did he who made the lamb make thee? Tyger, Tyger burning bright In the forests of the night... If we all work together we will be able to make it. So that's my idea... We can either lie down and let them walk on us or we can fight back and I'm for fighting back. So I say let's have a go! Well I think it's a smashing idea, Nicky, but I couldn't take part. My mum would be furious. That's your own fault. You should've brought your parents up better. I vote for it. Well I vote, we take a vote. Hey wait a minute, what about old Dingle? When we've made up our own minds, we'll talk to him. Right. Those in favour of Nicky's scheme raise your right hand. Okay, fine. I say Nicky, can I come too? You... you'll be where all good little boys should be... in bed. Go on, scram, vamoose! - Nicky. - What? I could tell the head. But I won't. Yeah. But it's in our own time, sir. We can do what we like in our own time. No. But if we could raise the money, it would show the head just how keen we are. No. I'm sorry you won't come in with us, but it's been agreed by a majority vote. We shall go ahead, sir. And if you should change your mind, we're meeting outside the Corn Exchange at seven o'clock tonight. Oi, oi... What are you trying to do? Take the bread out of me mouth? Now look son, go on, 'op it. Hop it before I skin you alive... and that goes for you too. Go on, the lot of you, 'op it. Ladies and gentlemen, the first trick I am about to show you has never yet been performed in public. Now it took me years to perform this trick and you're very lucky people... They don't seem to appreciate this stuff, do they? No. We'll have to er... broaden our appeal a bit, I think. - Hot it up, you mean, sir? - Well in for a penny, in for a pound. Okay sir. And I'll rope in some of the younger kids, that'll soften them up a bit. Good-oh. I'll get to work on some of the girls. We'll show 'em.

Cor not bad for one night. Jolly good. We need about 200 pounds in all. At this rate, we'll be old and grey before we get it. I don't know. Lemme see, three pounds a night, seven nights a week... in about ten weeks or so we'd be-- We'd be dead. Sir, my father's in the music business. - Could I talk to him? - How would that help us? Oh my dad's a fair wonder. He can fiddle any... I mean he's got tons of ideas. Well there's no harm in asking his advice. Right. Hey what're you doing with that. I'm the treasurer. Don't worry, it's safe. All good things must come to an end... School tomorrow... Go on, buzz off and let me drink my coffee in peace. - Goodnight, sir. - Goodnight. Thanks for coming sir. You're a sport. I'm an idiot, but we'll let that pass. Mr. Dingle, sir. I thought I told you to go home to bed. I had to wait until the others went home, sir. I've just got to speak to you, you see. I must... Won't it do as well tomorrow? No, I must speak to you alone. It's private you see... personal, and very urgent. You'd better sit down and tell me about it. What is it, Paulette? What's on your mind? Oh, it isn't me, sir. It's a friend of mine. You see this friend is involved in a terribly tragic situation. Absolutely awful. You see, there are two boys... I mean men. And they're both terribly attractive and this friend likes them both. And she doesn't know which one to choose. It's a triangle, you see? An eternal triangle. Yes, it's... er... tricky. Oh, terribly tricky. Hmm... Er... has your... friend spoken to her mother about this? Oh it's no good doing that. She'd only laugh and tell me-- tell her not to be silly. She's all right but she just wouldn't understand as you do. Well it's... it's hardly my territory, you know? But she's got to decide. She's just got to decide. Er... these two young men, are you quite sure they both feel the same way about your friend? Oh yes, but they haven't exactly said, of course. But she knows. A woman can always tell. Yes. How old is your friend? About your age? Yes. Yes... She's not a child. Well it's tough, this relationship between men and women is... is never easy, you know. Oh it's terribly complex. I... I had a friend once who took up gardening. He was worried about some seeds he'd planted. You know what he did? Dug them all up to see why they wouldn't grow. Well naturally he killed the lot. Oh that was stupid. Yes, of course. He realises now that you shouldn't try to, er, rush nature. Get it? Well it's the same with your friend, she... she should wait, carry on just as she is. What? With two men? Well... er... well... er... not quite, no. I mean she shouldn't try to hurry things. She won't have to wait long. One afternoon, one evening, she'll be with these two fellows and suddenly, without any warning... the lightning will strike. She'll know beyond any shadow of doubt which one she wants. Now you... You just tell her to wait for the lightning. Yes I will... the lightning. Come on young woman, home. I'll have your father chasing me. - I'll see you to the corner. - Thank you. The new instruments, they're here. - You're kidding! - Hurry up, you twerps. I'll tell him to drive on the back of the gym. You get Dingle there somehow. - Right! - There's no time to lose. - But how the Dickens-- - I'll explain later. Good thing the head isn't here today. Round the back driver. Music should be a compulsory subject in all schools. - Come now... - Don't come now me, Routledge. If you'd been taught to appreciate music you wouldn't have such an infernal grudge against life. Me, a grudge? Oh really. I did start to learn the piano accordion. "Piano acc--" I'm talking of music, Wyvie, not the grumblings and rumblings of a tortured tummy. Don't stand there hissing, boy. Don't you ever knock? - Answer. Answer. - I came for Mr. Dingle, sir. It's urgent sir... about the orchestra. All right, Putnam. Orchestra! Do you know what's wrong with the world, my dear dim-witted colleague? No harmony, proportion, rhythm. We spend too much time stuffing this... or this, when it's this we should be worrying about. The heart, the soul... More music, my friend, music! Have a biscuit. Ugh. Who brought these? My father's firm, sir. They're new instruments. I've got eyes, Morris. Come on, speak up. Uh... Well sir, you see sir... it's like this... I... I explained it all to my father and he said he'd like to help us. That's very noble of him. He said we can have this stuff on the glad and sorry... special terms. Glad and sorry? Never, never... Instalment plan. So much down and the rest every month. It's very interesting. I gave him the cash we collected as a deposit. He said he'd make it easy for you. You just have to sign these papers. What a cheek! The whole thing is absolutely preposterous! It would take years... to... er... It'd... It'd take years to er... Well I suppose there's... no harm in trying them now they're here, is there? - You try it, sir. - Go on sir. Perhaps that one's too hard for you, sir. Why don't you try something easier? My angels, for the first time, you're really beginning to sound like something. We're going to keep them, sir? Naturally. Morris' father has gone to a great deal of trouble. We can't let him down, can we? Morris, give me those papers. - Excuse me, sir. Am I in, sir? - In? From now on Lawson, you are an indispensable part of the orchestra. Where on earth did you learn to play like that, eh? My father, sir. He's in the London Philharmonic sir. The London Philharmonic? Ladies and gentlemen, incline your heads. Show proper respect. The son of a real musician is amongst us. Good! Don't stand there grinning like Cheshire cats... put those things away. Class in two minutes. Will it be all right with the headmaster, sir? About the instruments. Well, I don't think that Mr. Frome has quite the same approach to music as we have, Putnam. But... I think things will work out. Yes, I don't think we need worry on that score. Riley, step out to the board if you don't feel too tired and write down the names and dates of all the major battles in the Peninsular War. Sir... sir... the instruments, sir. Mr. Routledge, sir. He's locked them all up! Big padlock, sir. He says it's the headmaster's orders, sir. Putnam, take charge and carry on. Locking them up, are they? - Headmaster. - Do come in, I was expecting you. Did you give orders for the instruments to be locked away? - I did. - May I ask why? - Sit down, Mr. Dingle. - I didn't come here to sit down, sir. - I came to demand-- - "Demand"? Sit down, please. This is the reason. Well. The Director of Education has already been on to me. You have made a laughing stock of the school. Absolute nonsense! Nonsense or not, Mr. Dingle, those instruments will remain locked up. They will not be used again without my permission. But you can't do that! They don't even belong to... - You were about to say? - That doesn't matter... But what does matter is rehearsal. Unless we can rehearse, we won't qualify for the festival. And unless our pupils concentrate on their studies, they won't qualify for anything. Scraping a violin won't win scholarships. Is that your last word? It is. Supposing I said I couldn't carry on teaching under such conditions... You would be a great loss to the school. - Oh, well in that case I'll... - Yes? - I'll... er... - Well? Carry on teaching. Oh, stop it, Lawson. It sets my teeth on edge. Dry up young 'un. We're in no mood for music. He's too young to understand. And you're supposed to be sixth formers. I give up. In the Lower Fourth, we don't give in so easily. Oh pipe down. Oh! Riley! Come on boy, don't lounge there! Oh, Lord! Oh... Look at him. Few weeks ago, he was normal. Oh I don't know... This business of the relationship between men and women is pretty complex. Complex, my foot... That stuff's for cissies. Holding hands... Have you ever thought of a girl... well, in that way? Never. Well, take me for instance... What do you think of me, Nicky? You? You're a good sport. Oh, that's all? Oh, dry up old girl. You're beginning to talk like a woman. I am a woman. Well, that ain't to boast about. You know Paulette, I've been thinking. Young Lawson was right. Why should we let Old Frome get away with it? There must be something we can do. Catch. Give me a cheque for the first down payment and I'll make it easy for you. The first down payment? I thought that had been paid. Good gracious me, no! Twenty pounds is the first down payment. I've only had four and that leaves a balance of 16 pounds to pay. See, it's in the agreement. Yes... That's a bit of a shock! Still that... can't be helped, I suppose. Yes... I... I'd better let you have my personal cheque for the balance. - All right? - Naturally. And you'll see that the rest of the money must be paid over 12 months... eighteen pounds a month. - It's... four pounds ten a week, isn't it? - Uh huh. That's a bit of a tight squeeze. Not to worry, that's the thing, Mr. Dingle. If you get a bit behind, well, I know I can trust you. My son told me you're a gentleman. With due respect, Mr. Morris, your son is no judge of that. - Thank you. - Thank you. I'm up to my neck. I can't get hold of the instruments without spilling the beans to the head. - So I've got to pay for them. - Oh you are in a mess, dear. I just have to cut down on my beer, that's all. Oh you can't do that, you've got to have your vitamins. Two browns. Why don't you get a part-time job teaching music? I have enough teaching all day, really. - No, no, no, no. You've got it wrong. - Eh? You've got it wrong. It goes like this... see? See? - Come on, you have a bash, guv'nor. - What? Yes, come on. Come on, let's see the whites of your eyes. We've got to do something. Somehow or other we've got to get hold of those instruments so that we can rehearse. - Right? - Right. I vote that you and Crowther and Ginger form a committee to work it out. Otherwise we'll go on nagging all night. - Okay, agreed? - Agreed. Browning... Peggy... You with us? - Oh yes, yes! - Good. And we all agree to stick together come what may. - Whatever happens we'll fight! - To the death. Discussion is only useful in so far as it contributes directly or indirectly-- Scrag him!

Come on Jack, drink up. - Where'd you dig him up from Alex? - Ah! - He's a very fine pianist that bloke. - Ah yes! Good night. Bye bye. - Goodnight old boy. - Goodnight. Well, I enjoyed that. That was a smashing show you put up tonight. Well, it's not my usual line, but it didn't go down too badly, did it? How would you like to do it regular? - What? - I'd pay you. Four quid and free beer. Four nights a week. Where's your manners? He's a school teacher. You'll offend him. Oh no, not a bit. I'm... I'm flattered. I told you to take a spare time job, didn't I? - Four pounds a week? - Yeah. And free beer. Alex my friend, it's a deal. Four pounds a week and free beer. With those words, you have written a symphony which would make even Beethoven bow down before you bareheaded and boggle. Goodnight. And you see, sir, since the instruments really belong to the orchestra, there could be no harm in our taking them could there, sir? And how do you propose... taking them? You've seen those padlocks? - Yes. - We've worked all that out, sir. Crowther thinks he could blow the doors off the cupboards, sir. Very subtle. If you want the whole world to know what you're up to that is the best scheme. What do you suggest, sir? Suggest? You're asking me to suggest ways and means of breaking into the school property? It's preposterous! Blowing doors off cupboards... I suppose the next thing you'll want is to take an impression of the locks and make new keys. Make the keys! Then we could put the stuff back after we've used it and no one any the wiser! Precisely. As you say Putnam, a fantastic suggestion. I want to hear no more about it. Keys! How's it going? Finished! Oh, good, come on! - You got it? - Of course. Right. Lawson, Morris... Take one end of the gym each and keep cave. If anyone comes give us an owl's call. Like this. l can't do an owl. But I can do a yellow billed willow warbler, or a white tailed sea eagle. Do a cuckoo, twerp. You others, follow me. Peggy, stay here with the cart. - Right. - I'd better stay here too. All right. Right, come on. - I got them open! - Sh... Shut up, you idiot! Cuckoo. - Cave. - Get down! Cuckoo. Cuckoo. - By the way, I meant to tell you-- - Wait! - Cuckoo. - There it goes. again. - A cuckoo! - A cuckoo at this time of the year? It is extraordinary. I really must write to The Times about it. Yes I should. It's most unusual. Quick, give me a hand with the cart. Here he is, quick, tell them! Hello, Paulette. - What's all the hoo-ha about? - We've got a surprise for you, sir. Inside. Mmm... Quite a party! Rehearsing, Putnam? - Yes sir. - Hmm... Carry on, please. No, no, no, no, no, no! Terrible, terrible! If you're going to rehearse, do it properly! Fiddles, that first beat is a down beat. I want a down bow, not an up bow, a down bow. Right, come on now, pay attention! Try not to make it sound like a pack of hounds being run over by a steam roller. Right, that's enough. Here we go. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hands up anybody who can't read music. Nobody? Alright then, read it! Look at those first few bars. Look at them, don't look at me. Look at the bars... look at them! ♪ Ta tum tum ta, ta ta ta, ta tum ♪ Pomposo, pomposo! You know what that means, Putnam? - Yes sir. - Alright, pomposo it up a bit then! Come on! Right. Come on, here goes. A very good finish, ladies and gentlemen. Bassoon, you were in too early again. There were far too many back stage noises from the kitchen, but you're beginning to show real improvement after eight weeks' hard work. Jolly good! All right. Break now. Do you really think we're coming on, sir? You'll pass with a good push. But don't let it go to your head now. - Heavens! I'm late. - Late? Yes, work... More music, different kind... bye. Goodbye, sir. Compliments of the boss. Evening Madge, evening, sir. What's the poison? - Gin and tonic, please Rene. - Scotch please. What did I tell you? Isn't he absolutely smashing? Yes, sounds like it. Made the world of difference to this pub. And a tonic. You must come and look at his hands... they're fantastic. That's a right... Thank you. Yes, he absolutely sends me too. He plays here every night? Practically. Three other pubs have been after him. - Drink up. - What's that? Drink up. We're going. Oh don't be so absurd. We've only just got here. Never mind. I'm going. Are you coming? Oh all right. You're worse than a flea at a picnic. You can't keep in one place for five minutes. Bravo! There may be some reasonable explanation. Explanation? Thumping a piano in a public house? I'm not in the habit of judging a man or his motives until I know the facts. I shall speak to Mr. Dingle. I expect this is him now. Come in. - Mr. Frome. - My name is Frome. Ah yes... my card. Mellotone Musical Instrument Company. Very pleased to meet you Mr. Frome. Now I've got something here that will interest you... an organ. A modern super deluxe electric organ. Do you know how many stops and pedals? Over 150. But... I'm not going to try and sell you now, Mr. Frome. I'm just going to leave you these few things to study. Then you can have one on appro. And of course, easy terms, same as the other things. Just a moment. What other things are you referring to, Mr. Parks? You don't want to deprive yourself of an organ just because you're short of cash. You're paying off for the other things so why not go in for an organ? - What other things? - You've got an account with us. A couple of months back, you bought 200 pounds worth of new musical instruments on credit. Come in. You wanted to see me, headmaster? I did indeed. Good morning, Mr. Parks. What? - Don't stand there gawping man. - But you're taking these, of course? No, you're taking them. I'm busy. Good morning. Oh well! No hard feelings, Mr. Frome, eh! Oh. Mmm... Interesting. Organs... My card. Oh, thank you. Ah, thank you. Perhaps you would wait outside, Mr. Routledge. I may need you in a few moments. That the lot? Good. Well, headmaster, I'm all yours. Hey... Dingle's in with the head. He'll be gone for ages. Come on then. Let's have a go. One, two... ♪ La, la, la la la... ♪ Alright, I'll leave soon enough. Mr. Dingle, you will leave now. No, you can't go in there. Oh Mr. Routledge. Why whatever's happened? Dingle. Mr. Routledge, please go to the Upper Sixth and take over until I can adopt other measures. What has happened to Mr. Dingle? Mr. Dingle has resigned, as from this moment. Hurry, Mr. Routledge. Mr. Dingle will have no further dealings with this school. - Can I do anything? - "Do anything"? The man's a born teacher... and an irresponsible obstinate lunatic! There's nothing anyone can do. Ch... cheese it everybody. Here comes Dingle. We're carrying on with chapter six, sir. All right, Putnam. Right. Pay attention everybody. What is the subject of the present lesson? Putnam, you answer. History, sir. We're doing the Industrial Revolution. Chapter six in Brooks' Concise English History. Thank you, Putnam. Now carry on reading chapter six. In 15 minutes time, I shall ask you questions. I'd expect the correct answers. Riley, Browning, Wilson, the books are on the desk, not out here. Mr. Dingle, sir... Is anything wrong? Putnam, sit down at once. Mr. Dingle, please. The headmaster expressly asked me to-- You must forgive me, Putnam. I was so carried away with my own thoughts I was forgetting to say goodbye. Mr. Routledge is taking over for the time being I believe. I hope that you will take care of him as well as you've taken care of me. I'm... pressing on to pastures new. Well... That's all. Good luck. All right everyone... Chapter six. Mr. Dingle has defied my instructions... not once but many times. But we've already explained, sir. We were just as much to blame. Mr. Dingle is... er... was a master. It was his duty to maintain authority not to aid and abet you in your insubordination. But sir, it isn't fair-- Paulette! Mr. Frome has explained the circumstances. You're breaking up for holidays in a few days' time. When you come back, all this will be forgotten. But what about the orchestra, Mrs. Castle? Miss Merrow has some... musical experience I believe. She may be able to help you. If we can't have Mr. Dingle, sir, then we don't want the orchestra. That will be all, Putnam. Putnam! Haven't you forgotten something? Good evening, Mrs. Castle. Good evening, Mrs. Castle. I'm sorry, headmaster. I didn't get near then, did I? I think you did very well. You explained everything. They still don't understand. I just didn't get near them. What did he say? He wouldn't budge. No soap. Dingle stays out. All right... all right... pipe down, you chumps... We're not going to let it rest here. Right? - Right. - Okay. Meeting tonight at my place, everybody. We'll show 'em. Agreed? Agreed. Nicky, couldn't we throw these under old Frome's nose? What's that, Crowther? Tear gas. Oh, chump! It is really. My father used it during the war. He was in Civil Defence. You mean it's a tear gas bomb? Well sort of. You throw it down, it breaks, the gas gets out and phew... Put it away, you ass. We're in enough trouble as it is. Oh phooey! What are we going to do, Nicky? I don't know... yet. But if Frome won't listen to reason, then we'll have to think of something else. There's such a thing as justice you know. Stop talking. - All set? - All set. We will start assembly this morning... with "Jerusalem The Golden." ♪ Jerusalem the golden ♪ ♪ With milk and honey blest ♪ ♪ Beneath thy... ♪ Thank you, Miss Merrow. Perhaps you will start again, please. And this time, the whole school will join in singing. ♪ Jerusalem the golden ♪ ♪ With milk and honey blest ♪ ♪ Beneath thy... ♪ Unless you stop this behaviour at once, I may be forced to take other measures. I suggest that you make up your minds quickly. Ready? Okay. We will try once more. That's the lot, come on, quick! I'll drop one of these gas bombs, shall I? You twerp, give it to me, you'll spoil everything! I'm not going to have any more of this. Do you hear what I said? Keep your places. Silence... at once... silence! Mr. Paterson... those boys on the roof, I want their names at once. All members of the staff will go into the body of the hall and stand by their forms. We shall stay here all day if necessary. I will not tolerate any more disturbances or any further show of disobedience! The teachers will note the name of any boy or girl who does not sing, and report them to me. Now... Miss Merrow. We want Dingle. Justice for Mr. Dingle. I will give you all one more chance. We want Dingle. We want Dingle. One, two, three, four, who are we for? Dingle. Silence. D-I-N-G-L-E! Dismiss... Dismiss. All right, girls. That will do. Paulette, will you collect the impositions? The rest of you pay attention. Peggy? will you kindly rub this out? And you might all note that the word tyranny is spelled with two N's, not one. This is Mr. Scott, children. The schools inspector. He has just come along to see how well we are doing with our lessons. Thank you, Miss Wyvern. Just carry on as usual please. Right, children. Just a few simple, general knowledge questions to begin with. Answer up smartly now. Ah... Lawson. Will you tell us when Magna Carta was signed, by whom and what were its principle contents. Magna Charta chicaroco choo chi twelve fifteen. Babodidi lorum paddy waddy wah. Ocho ocho itimon er King John. Chicaroce chio chu the Barons. More slowly, Lawson please. Enunciate carefully. Magna Charta chicaroco choo chi twelve fifteen. Dabodidi lorum paddy waddy wah. Ocho ocho itimon King John. Chicaroce chio chu... the Barons. That will do. Putnam, give a brief description of Manchester, its climate, population and chief industries. Manchester did you say, sir? I did. Carry on. Manchester... let me see now. Manchester... It's a city, sir. You know very well it's a city. Answer the question. Um... Manchester is the capital city of Manchuria. Stop! Stop at once. Go to Mr. Frome and tell him I sent you. - Riley. - Yes sir? - Tell the class. - Um... Tell them what, sir? Tell the class... Is Manchester anywhere near Manchuria? Oh no, sir. Good... where is it? Um... Abyssinia, sir. Riley! Yes sir. I know sir. Now... we'll have some order here. Browning... What is the principal industry of Manchester? What sir? Who sir, me sir? Answer! Answer what, sir? What do they make in Manchester? Bread pudding, sir. Browning! There's been a certain amount of unrest in the school, but that'll pass. Children are notoriously sentimental. But you told me to light a match, sir. Sorry Alex. Can't be did. At the end of the week I move on. But you'll get another job teaching, love. Not in this town. Not in this country if the head has any say in it. I could squeeze another... well... another pound a week. You're a prince Alex. No, I couldn't do it. No... I'll do a spot of travelling... eh, go abroad. - You're going abroad? - Mmm... To foreign parts, Rene. I went abroad once. Boulogne on a day trip. It was horrible. I think I'll go further than that. Japan. China. I've always wanted to study oriental music. You'll never be happy without your kids... your angels. Mmm... My devils. Yes. I'll... I'll miss the little perishers, but I doubt they'll miss me, though. I doubt if in a couple of days, they'll remember my name. We want Dingle! We want Dingle! How much longer do you intend to keep this up, Putnam? We want Dingle! We want Dingle! Putnam! Sir? - I have been very patient. - Too patient. Please, Mr. Routledge. I'm giving your last warning. You will go down and stop this noise. You understand? I don't want to hear another word from any of you. Yes sir. You've had your fun. Now back to work. We'll all try to forget these... incidents. If we could make you understand about Mr. Dingle, sir. That will do. Not another word. Not another word from any of you. Is that clear? Yes sir... not another word. We want Dingle! We want Dingle! We want Dingle! I'm afraid we're being too lax... too lax. I am open to any useful suggestions, Mr. Routledge. A strong dose of discipline. Any fool can govern with a stick in his hand. These children happen to be standing up for something... someone they believe in. You mean you condone their conduct? No, no. On the contrary. But we can all afford to reflect upon our own failure. - Failure? - Yes, failure, Mr. Routledge. They are loyal to one man. Have you or I... been able to inspire the same devotion and loyalty? They've stopped. They've quietened down. I think they've come to their senses. Browning! Give the names of the principal leaders of the French Revolution. Browning... did you hear me? Ah... I'll come back to you later. Riley, give the answer! Ah... A conspiracy of silence eh? Wilson... Morris... Mansard! Crowther... Stand up. Stand up I say! The headmaster shall hear of this. - They won't talk. They won't talk. - Nor mine. Not a word. They won't answer me... they won't speak. They've gone dumb! Yes, yes. Of course. Not unless it is absolutely necessary. Thank you. Mr. Frome, the whole school is silent. They refuse to speak. - Won't answer any questions. - It's rebellion. One girl did pass me a note... They are obeying your orders, headmaster. - My orders? - That's what the note said. You are supposed to have told one of the senior boys that you didn't want to hear a word from any pupil at the school. Please... I have been on the telephone to the Director of Education. As you know, this term ends in three days' time. I have permission to advance the date. We will close this term now... at once. Won't that look as though we're giving in to them? I don't think so. The school will be on holiday for six weeks. When we reassemble, this little incident will have been forgotten. I think that's a first-rate idea. Three days extra holiday. That'll scuttle 'em. Perhaps you'd all go back to your forms and make the announcement. Very well, headmaster. I don't like it, headmaster. Smacks of surrender. I don't like it either, Mr. Routledge, but I think it may prove to be effective. Eyes left! Eyes front! Headmaster... Oh, headmaster... A terrible thing. They've locked themselves in the gymnasium. - Gymnasium? - Yes! They say they won't... they won't budge until Mr. Dingle comes back. - We must show them once and for all. - What do you suggest I do? Call the police, the fire brigade, and have them evicted? No... No, we'll wait. They are young, healthy animals. In an hour's time, they'll be wanting their tea. In two hours, they'll be ravenous. We'll wait. Right. Lawson get up here. Tell us the moment you see anyone. Morris, Browning, Ginger... Check the doors and see that they're locked. Nicky, I'm hungry. Paulette... You're in charge of supplies. No rations to be issued without authority. Nicky, I'm starving! You'll wait! We've got to go easy on the grub. We might be here for weeks yet. Weeks? Crumbs! I shall fall through my trousers and hang myself on my braces. Anyone come yet? I wouldn't see them if they did. I'm so hungry I've got spots in front of my eyes. Honest Nicky, I could eat a horse and still find room for the saddle. This is the limit... Come on! You're not from this school, are you? No sir. Then you're trespassing... Go on, march! Look out... The head! What are you doing here? Ginger. Lock that door. Paulette, dish out an orange, a piece of cake and a couple of sweets. Then check on what we have left. Cave... here's old Frome! Lawson isn't it? Yes sir. Will you kindly open this door, Lawson? I can't sir. Putnam. All right Lawson. You do realise what you're doing, don't you? Yes sir. I have not come here to argue with you. But at least think of your parents and for their sakes, put a stop to this farce. I'm sorry sir. We think Mr. Dingle has been unfairly treated and we intend to-- I'll give you 30 minutes in which to make up your mind. If you haven't come to your senses by then, I shall send for the police and force an entry. What follows will be on your own heads. Nicky... what are we going to do? Do? It's no good banging our heads against a brick wall. We've done all we could. - Are you turning chicken? - Of course not. But we can't fight the police. I reckon it's bluff... I'm for holding out. Now listen. I know it's not easy. But why did we start this business in the first place? Because old Dingle had a raw deal. That hasn't altered. Did he ever stop to think of the consequences when he helped us? Did he ever let us down? And are we going to... crawl out now on our hands and knees and let them get away with it? They think we're a bunch of kids who don't know what we're doing... Well I'm for calling their bluff. We've got enough food here to feed a regiment. We can hold out until Kingdom come. So who's with me, eh? Who's for fighting? Right. Up the Angels. We'll show them we're not done yet. Yes. Oh Nicky, you were marvellous. Oh, come off it Paulette. I mean it. As you were talking, I felt as though I'd been struck by lightning. He's gone! That's odd. He was here a moment or so ago. Perhaps he's gone to the police already. It's time they were called in. We want Dingle... We want Dingle... Ach! You've no milk. I'll pop down and get you some. I don't like milk. But you must have milk! I don't like milk. I hate milk. Milk makes me vomit. Will you get out of the room, or shall I chase you out with this fork? Go away. I don't want any milk. Do you want me to-- Oh hello, headmaster. Come in! You're just in time to split a crumpet with me.

I've enjoyed our little chat. Pity you can't stay longer. I did hope to persuade you to use your influence with those children. It's just a lot of childish nonsense. When you get back, you'll find they've all gone home to tea. I wish I could believe that. I'm sorry, headmaster. But I honestly don't see-- You're sorry... you don't see. Precisely. This deplorable situation is as much your responsibility as mine but you're lucky. You were born without a conscience. You're one of those bright irresponsible people who create trouble and then wash their hands of it. Ho ho, I like that. I didn't walk out. You fired me, remember? I should have done it months ago. But, well... I liked you. I thought you were a good teacher. Goodnight, Mr. Dingle. - Hey wait a minute. - Yes? Are you trying to shift the blame on me? I'm trying to tell you that you had a part in it. You put your music and your orchestra above everything else. You not only encouraged defiance, you aided and abetted it. And yet you now try to pretend that this... this "nonsense" had nothing whatever to do with you. Of course I don't. But you handled it all wrong. You put everybody's backs up right from the start. I'm not a perfect headmaster, Mr. Dingle. Please don't make a catalogue of my mistakes, I know them better than you. What are you going to do? - Why? Are you interested? - Yes. I shall call the police and have them removed, by force if necessary. No doubt you will read about it in the newspapers. It isn't a story that will do much credit to either of us. After that I shall... tender my resignation. Why do you want to do that? I don't want to do it, Mr. Dingle. Strange as it may seem I've always enjoyed my work. I even thought I might make a good job of running this school. It seems I overestimated my capacity. Good night. Hey hold your horses. Hey, hey wait a minute! Does Nicky know that you're going to marry him? Sh! There's no need to shout. - I'm not going to marry him. - You've just said-- Not yet. I'm only trying to explain to you so that you won't be hurt. Oh I won't be hurt. You say that but I know. Really I do, Ginger. But time alters everything. You'll find a girl much prettier than me. Hmm, shouldn't be difficult. There's no need to take it that way. You'll aways be my very best friend and I shall always think of you with the utmost affection. Thank you... Wish the police would come. At least we'd know. Cave! Here's Frome... and hey... Dingle's with him, Dingle! Open up! Come on, open up. No... I... I'm sorry sir but we... I want to talk to you. Come on open up and look smart about it. All right sir. Dingle wants to speak to us. Come on, get this stuff cleared away. Three cheers for Mr. Dingle. - Hip hip! - Hooray! - Hip hip! - Hooray! - Hip hip! - Hooray! Right... Now let's get this straight. First of all, I'm not coming back here to take up my old job. You've made that impossible. You've behaved like irresponsible idiots... I'm ashamed of you. You're old enough to know your geometry, aren't you? Since when has the part been greater than the whole? Since when has one man been more important than the whole school? We were... only standing up for fair play, sir. Well, it does credit to your hearts but not your heads. And if you're not coming back sir... we'll carry on fighting. We'll find other ways. Yes, we will! Sentimental rubbish. Now let's look at the facts. Number one, I was asked to resign because I committed a breach of school discipline, a serious breach. Mr. Frome had no choice. Why didn't you come to me and ask me how I felt about it? How did you know I wanted to come back here and teach? You do sir, don't you? Well that brings me to fact number two. I have already taken another job. Aw... You're kidding, sir? Kidding? You flatter yourselves, don't you? What makes you think you're so special that I should want to come back here and teach? There are plenty of other schools. We've been wasting our time then. Precisely what I've been trying to tell you. Wait a minute all of you. Will you all please listen to me for one moment. - Headmaster, I think-- - You too, Mr. Dingle. I ought to tell you that Mr. Dingle has not taken another appointment. I'm fairly sure of it. - But I soon will. - As I thought. I don't want you to go away feeling that Mr. Dingle... has let you down. Perhaps it was my own fault but I was never able to... to win your confidence and affection as he's done. That is something that shouldn't be destroyed lightly, Mr. Dingle. - You're ruining everything. - I wonder. I think you've all behaved very badly... for the best reasons, I should like you to pay me the compliment of recognising that I have been guilty in the same way. Now you can put your mistake right by forgetting this incident. You can also help me to put my mistake right. Will you persuade Mr. Dingle to change his mind and to come back to us? Yes! Three cheers for the headmaster! - Hip hip! - Hooray! - Hip hip! - Hooray! - Hip hip! - Hooray!
