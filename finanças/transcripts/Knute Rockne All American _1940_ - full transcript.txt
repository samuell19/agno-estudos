THE BOYS TELL ME YOU'RE GOING OFF SOMEWHERE TO COLLEGE THIS FALL. IS THAT JUST ANOTHER JOKE? WELL, MAYBE IT IS. MAYBE IT IS. I'LL KNOW IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS. AIN'T YOU JUST A LITTLE TOO OLD TO START COLLEGE, ROCK? AH, THAT DOESN'T WORRY ME. I AM A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT BEING TOO DUMB TO FINISH. HA HA. I WOULDN'T TAKE A BET ON THAT. GOOD LUCK TO YOU, KID. WE'LL BE MISSING THAT FUNNY FACE OF YOURS AROUND HERE. THANKS, DANNY, AND THE SAME TO YOU. THANKS. ERIC. COME IN! HELLO. HOW ARE YOU? MY NAME'S ROCKNE-- KNUTE ROCKNE. MY NAMES DORAIS-- GUS DORAIS.

YOU'RE NOT A FRESHMAN, ARE YOU? SURE, I AM. WHY? OH, IT'S NOTHING. ONLY I-- SURE, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. I DON'T LOOK AS YOUNG AS THE REST OF THESE FELLOWS AROUND HERE. WELL, I'M NOT, BUT IT TOOK ME 6 YEARS OF HARD WORK TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO GET HERE. HOPE IT'S GONNA BE WORTH IT TO YOU. THANKS. IT'S GONNA BE. EVER DO ANY ATHLETICS? OH, A LITTLE TRACK, SOME FOOTBALL. I PLAYED A LITTLE FOOTBALL MYSELF. MAYBE WE'LL BE TRYING OUT FOR THE TEAM TOGETHER. I DIDN'T COME HERE TO PLAY FOOTBALL, DORAIS. BUT I MIGHT FIND A LITTLE TIME FOR IT. WHAT ARE YOU UP FOR, ROCK? I DON'T KNOW. ALL RIGHT, ROCKNE. FATHER CALLAHAN'LL SEE YOU NOW. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING, ROCK. GOOD MORNING, FATHER. FATHER NIEUWLAND. HELLO, KNUTE. NOW, JUST RELAX. I'VE GOT NOTHING ON YOU THIS TIME. KNUTE, YOU HAVE ONLY ONE MORE YEAR TO GO FOR YOUR DEGREE. I HOPE SO. YOU'VE MADE A FINE RECORD IN THE PAST 3 YEARS-- HONOR MAN IN YOUR CLASS, AND NEXT FALL, YOU'LL BE CAPTAIN OF FOOTBALL. THAT'S A VERY RARE COMBINATION. THANK YOU, FATHER. DO SIT DOWN. FATHER NIEUWLAND HERE TELLS ME YOU'VE GOT THE FINEST BRAIN FOR CHEMISTRY OF ANY MAN IN HIS CLASS. WELL, I GUESS IT'S A PRETTY DUMB CLASS. OH, NO. YOU HAVE A DEFINITE TALENT FOR SCIENCE, KNUTE. OH, THERE'S GOING TO BE A GREAT FUTURE FOR MEN LIKE YOU IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. THAT'S A GREAT COMPLIMENT, COMING FROM YOU, FATHER. WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR THE REST OF IT. I WANT YOU TO HELP ME THIS SUMMER, KNUTE-- STAY HERE AS MY ASSISTANT, WITH PAY. AS YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING TO PERFECT A NEW FORMULA FOR SYNTHETIC RUBBER, AND I NEED A GOOD MAN TO CHECK MY EXPERIMENTS. WELL, I DON'T KNOW QUITE WHAT TO SAY. THERE MUST BE 100 MEN WHO WOULD FIGHT FOR THE CHANCE TO WORK FOR YOU, FATHER. OH, THEN YOU WILL STAY? WELL, I'D LIKE TO. I APPRECIATE IT, YOU UNDERSTAND, BUT... YOU SEE, GUS DORAIS AND I HAVE SIGNED UP AS LIFEGUARDS FOR THE SUMMER AT CEDAR POINT. AS A LIFEGUARD? OH, NO. THAT'S NO WORK FOR A MAN WITH YOUR INTELLIGENCE. YOU'RE PASSING UP A GREAT OPPORTUNITY, KNUTE. OH, I REALIZE THAT, FATHER. WELL, MAYBE NEXT YEAR-- I'M NOT INTERESTED IN NEXT YEAR. MY WORK WON'T WAIT. I PICKED YOU OUT BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU HAD SOME BRAINS. OH, BUT I PROMISED GUS-- HE SAYS HE PROMISED GUS. I COULD MAKE A FIRST-CLASS SCIENTIST OF YOU INSIDE OF 10 YEARS. THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE BORN TO BE, ANYWAY, YOU--YOU BIG SWEDE. WHO CAN SAY FOR CERTAIN, FATHER, WHAT A MAN WAS REALLY BORN TO BE? THAT'S GOD'S WILL, NOT OURS. SOMEDAY KNUTE WILL FIND HIS RIGHT PLACE IN THE WORLD. AND WHEN HE DOES, WHETHER IT BE SCIENCE OR NOT, I HAVE A FEELING IT WILL BE THE ONE THING HE WAS MEANT TO DO. OF COURSE, YOU AND DORAIS COULDN'T BE TAKING A FOOTBALL ALONG TO CEDAR POINT BY ANY CHANCE, WOULD YOU? WHATEVER GAVE YOU THAT IDEA, FATHER? GOOD WORKOUT, HUH? YEAH. SEE THE TRIBUNE THIS MORNING, ROCK? I HAVEN'T SEEN A NEWSPAPER IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS. IF YOU'D STOP MOONING AROUND BONNIE SKILES LIKE A LOVESICK CALF, MAYBE YOU'D LEARN SOME NEWS. OH, STOP, WILL YOU, GUS? WHAT? NOTRE DAME'S PLAYING ARMY THIS FALL. PLAYING THE ARMY NOVEMBER, AT WEST POINT. PAPER SAYS THEY GOT THE GREATEST TEAM IN HISTORY. 3 ALL-AMERICANS. WE'LL HAVE A NICE TRIP BACK EAST, AND THEY'LL PROBABLY TEAR US APART. WHO SAID SO? DON'T BE A SAP, ROCK. THE ARMY OUTWEIGHS US 20 POUNDS TO THE MAN. WE COULDN'T LICK THEM IF WE TOOK A SHOTGUN ALONG. ALL RIGHT, WE'LL TAKE A SHOTGUN. YOU OUGHT TO TAKE IT EASY, ROCK. THE SUN'S BEGINNING TO GET YOU. GUS, DO YOU REALIZE WHAT THIS MEANS? THIS GAME IS THE GREATEST CHANCE NOTRE DAME HAS EVER HAD. YEAH, IT'S GREAT, ALL RIGHT, AND SO'S THE ARMY. WE'RE GONNA BEAT THE ARMY, GUS. AW, ROCK. NO, WE'RE GONNA BEAT 'EM. I GOT AN IDEA. YOU SEE, ALL THESE EASTERN TEAMS, LIKE THE ARMY, ARE ALL POWER-- KNOCK YOU DOWN, RUN OVER YOU LIKE A STEAMROLLER. ALL RIGHT, IF YOU CAN'T GO AROUND THE STEAMROLLER, YOU CAN GO OVER IT. NO TEAM HAS EVER USED A FORWARD PASS AS THE MAJOR THREAT OF ITS OFFENSE. CONSEQUENTLY, NO TEAM HAS EVER HAD A GOOD DEFENSE AGAINST IT. GUS, WE'RE GONNA PASS THE ARMY. WE'RE GONNA PASS 'EM DIZZY. GIVE ME THAT BALL. ROCK, IF THAT WORKS, IT'LL MAKE HISTORY! CERTAINLY! LET'S START MAKING HISTORY! TAKE IT! HIKE! SUMMER'S NEARLY OVER, KNUTE. YEP. YOU'LL BE GOING BACK TO NOTRE DAME NEXT WEEK, AND I'M GOING HOME. THAT'S RIGHT, BONNIE. WE WON'T BE SEEING EACH OTHER AGAIN FOR A LONG TIME. NO, NOT TILL CHRISTMAS VACATION. TELL YOU WHAT, BONNIE. I'LL SPEND A WEEK WITH THE FAMILY IN CHICAGO, AND THE REST OF THE TIME WITH YOUR FOLKS. HOW'S THAT? AW, THAT'LL HELP TILL JUNE. BONNIE, I DON'T KNOW WE'RE GONNA LIVE ON AFTER WE'RE MARRIED. YOU'RE TAKING AN AWFUL CHANCE. WE'LL GET ALONG. I CAN COOK AND SEW, AND YOU'LL GET A JOB. FATHER NIEUWLAND SEEMS TO THINK HE CAN MAKE A CHEMIST OUT OF ME. THINK I'D BE ANY GOOD AT IT? YOU'D BE A SUCCESS AT ANYTHING YOU TRIED, KNUTE. BONNIE, UH... I'M NOT EXACTLY... WHAT YOU'D CALL THE ROMANTIC TYPE, BUT... BUT I'LL DO EVERYTHING ON EARTH TO MAKE YOU HAPPY. YOU KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU? I KNOW THAT. SOMETHING ELSE I WANT TO TELL YOU TONIGHT. BONNIE-- YES, KNUTE? GUS AND I HAVE GOT A GREAT SURPRISE COOKED UP FOR THE ARMY. WE WORKED IT OUT ALL SUMMER AT THE BEACH. OH, BONNIE, IT'LL MAKE HISTORY. YOU SEE, NOBODY HAS EVER USED THE FORWARD PASS, THAT IS, THE WAY NOTRE DAME IS GONNA USE IT. IT WORKS OUT LIKE THIS. GUS FADES BACK, TAKES THE BALL FROM CENTER. I RUN DOWN THE FIELD, AND NOW... WHAT'S THE MATTER? GO ON. "AND NOW..." YEAH. NOW SOMEBODY OUGHT TO... KICK ME RIGHT IN THE SEAT OF THE PANTS. OH, KNUTE. MOVE IN THERE, JIMMY. HOLD THAT LINE. WATCH 'EM NOW, ROCK. WATCH OVER CENTER, JOE. Dorais: 22, 45, 18! HIKE! NICE GAME, RED. NEVER MIND THE SCORE. JUST KEEP PLUGGING THAT TACKLE. YOU BETTER GET SOME WATER, BUD. YOU LOOK A LITTLE GROGGY. SAY, COACH? YEAH? I CAN OUTRUN THAT HALFBACK THAT'S BEEN COVERING ME. HE DOESN'T KNOW IT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN LIMPING PURPOSELY TO FOOL HIM. YEAH, I BEEN WATCHING HIM, TOO. HE MOVES UP IN EVERY PLAY. COACH, LET US USE THE FORWARD PASS. I KNOW IT'LL WORK. I'M NOT SO SURE. WE'VE NEVER SEEN IT IN THE GAME. NEITHER HAS THE ARMY. WHAT CAN WE LOSE? ALL RIGHT. IT'S YOUR IDEA, ROCK. IF YOU THINK YOU CAN PUT IT OVER, GO AHEAD. THANKS, COACH. WHAT'S THE MATTER, HOOSIERS? CAN'T YOU GET STARTED? Rockne: SIGNALS! 27, 34, 56! HIP! COME ON, LET'S GO. ALL RIGHT, CLEAR IT OUT! ALL RIGHT, ROCK. LET'S OPEN UP. LET 'ER GO. I'LL BE WAITING. Dorais: SIGNALS! 27! 32! 45! HIP! THEY CAN'T DO THAT! THEY JUST DID FOR 45 YARDS. COME ON, BOYS. WE'RE STILL BEHIND. LOOK AT THAT SCOREBOARD. THAT'LL REVOLUTIONIZE FOOTBALL. * CHEER, CHEER FOR OLD NOTRE DAME * * WAKE UP THE ECHOES CHEERING HER NAME * * SEND A VOLLEY CHEER ON HIGH * SHAKE DOWN THE THUNDER FROM THE SKY * * WHAT THOUGH THE ODDS BE GREAT OR SMALL * * OLD NOTRE DAME WILL WIN OVER ALL * * WHILE HER LOYAL SONS ARE MARCHING * * ONWARD TO VICTORY * CHEER, CHEER FOR OLD NOTRE DAME * COME ON, BOYS, LET ME DOWN. I FEEL LIKE A FOOL UP HERE. BETTER TAKE IT WHILE YOU CAN, ROCK. YOU'LL NEVER HEAR THIS AGAIN. GOOD MORNING, KNUTE. MORNING, FATHER. NOW THAT YOU'VE GRADUATED WITH A MAGNA CUM LAUDE, WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR THE FUTURE? WELL, I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET. I'VE HAD A FEW OFFERS. FATHER NIEUWLAND. PERHAPS FATHER NIEUWLAND HERE CAN HELP YOU. WHAT? WHAT KIND OF OFFERS? WELL, THERE'S NOTHING VERY DEFINITE. TO COACH FOOTBALL-- IS THAT IT? YES, IN A... SORT OF A WAY. I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M DUMB ENOUGH TO OFFER YOU ANOTHER JOB OR WHY I BOTHERED TO LOOK FOR A SYNTHETIC RUBBER WHEN YOU HAVE GOT A SOLID HEAD OF IT. DID YOU SAY A JOB, FATHER? MMM. MAYBE I'VE CHANGED MY MIND. FATHER NIEUWLAND WANTS YOU TO STAY HERE AT NOTRE DAME TO HELP HIM TEACH CHEMISTRY. THE JOB DOESN'T PAY VERY MUCH AT THE START, BUT NIEUWLAND HAS GREAT HOPES FOR YOU LATER ON. I'LL TAKE THE JOB. THANK YOU, FATHER. YOU'LL START NEXT TERM. WELL, THERE'S, UH, JUST ONE MORE THING. DO YOU HAVE ANY OBJECTIONS IF I STAY ON AND HELP HARPER WITH THE FOOTBALL TEAM THIS FALL? YES! YOU ARE THROUGH WITH FOOTBALL. GET THAT INTO YOUR HEAD, ONCE AND FOR ALL. WELL, IT WOULDN'T TAKE THAT MUCH OF MY TIME, AND THE EXTRA MONEY I'D MAKE COULD HELP ME A GREAT DEAL. YOU SEE... I'M PLANNING ON GETTING MARRIED. HMM. I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE PICKED A PRIEST. I'LL ONLY COACH FOR A YEAR, AND THAT'LL PUT ME ON MY FEET. FATHER, YOU DON'T THINK I'D BE CRAZY ENOUGH TO TAKE UP COACHING AS A LIFEWORK, DO YOU? YOU, O'REILLY. DID YOU GET IT? NO, OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T. BOUNCED RIGHT OFF YOUR BEAN, DIDN'T IT? WELL, DID ANY OF YOU GET IT? THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S FINE. KEEPS THE RECORD PERFECT. WELL, MAYBE YOU DON'T LIKE CHEMISTRY. I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT. MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO TAKE UP KNITTING OR FOLK DANCING. NOTHING DUMBER THAN A DUMB IRISHMAN. EXCEPT A SMART SWEDE. THE BOYS TELL ME YOU ARE A GOOD TEACHER, KNUTE. THEY ALL WANT TO BE IN YOUR CLASS. YES. THAT'S WHAT WORRIES ME. I DON'T GET ANY RESPECT. NONE AT ALL. YOU'LL HAVE RESPECT SOMEDAY-- ALL YOU CAN EVER USE-- IF OUR WORK HERE IS SUCCESSFUL. AND, WELL, IF WE CAN FIND THE ANSWER, IF WE CAN MAKE GOOD RUBBER CHEAPLY AND WITHOUT USING GUM, A GREAT PART OF THE CREDIT WILL BE YOURS, KNUTE. NO, FATHER. YOU'RE THE QUARTERBACK ON THIS TEAM. I'M JUST THE WATER BOY. ALWAYS WILL BE. AND YOU--YOU CAN BE ANYTHING YOU WANT. I HAVE WATCHED YOU EVER SINCE YOU CAME TO NOTRE DAME FROM THE FIRST DAY YOU ASKED A QUESTION IN MY CLASS. I GUESS I WAS PRETTY MUCH OF A NUISANCE WITH ALL MY QUESTIONS, WASN'T I, FATHER? THAT'S HOW I KNEW YOU MIGHT MAKE A SCIENTIST, AND YOU WILL, KNUTE, BELIEVE ME, I KNOW. YOU HAVE THE BRAINS AND THE STRENGTH. LOOK, THESE FIRST FEW YEARS ARE THE HARDEST. JUST LIVE SIMPLY. I GIVE YOU A CHIN-UP. WE ARE GOING TO DO GREAT THINGS, YOU AND I. YES? FATHER NIEUWLAND'S LABORATORY. THIS IS MR. ROCKNE SPEAKING. WHEN? WHERE? WHAT-- I-I'LL BE THERE RIGHT AWAY. KNUTE, WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S HAPPENED? IT'S BONNIE. IT'S THE BABY. IT'S HERE! GO IN PEACE AND THE LORD BE WITH THEE. AMEN. HE'S A FINE-LOOKING BABY, BONNIE. THANK YOU, FATHER. YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF HIM, KNUTE. PROUD OF HIM? LOOK AT THOSE MUSCLES. HE'S A BORN FULLBACK AND HE'S CALLING SIGNALS LIKE A QUARTERBACK. WELL, SCIENTISTS ALSO HAVE MUSCLES, YOU KNOW. PERHAPS HE'D PREFER TO WEAR A RUBBER APRON INSTEAD OF A RUBBER NOSE GUARD. HE SHOULD HAVE A RUBBER SOMETHING RIGHT NOW, I THINK. KNUTE, GIVE HIM TO ME. OHHH. FATHER, I'M AT WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL THE CROSSROADS. FOR 3 YEARS NOW, I'VE BEEN TEACHING CHEMISTRY AND TRYING TO COACH FOOTBALL AT THE SAME TIME. I'VE GOT TO DECIDE BETWEEN THEM. YES, I'VE SEEN THAT COMING. AND WHICH WORK IS CLOSEST TO YOUR HEART? WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY, FATHER, IS GOING TO DISAPPOINT YOU, I'M SURE. AND THAT'S WHAT WORRIES ME THE MOST. FATHER, I'VE DECIDED TO TAKE UP COACHING AS MY LIFEWORK. HMM. YOU THINK I'M MAKING A MISTAKE, DON'T YOU? ANYONE WHO FOLLOWS THE TRUTH IN HIS HEART NEVER MAKES A MISTAKE. I'VE WATCHED YOUR WORK WITH THESE BOYS THESE PAST FEW YEARS, AND I'VE SEEN THE SPLENDID RESULTS. YOU'RE HELPING MANKIND, KNUTE. AND ANYONE WHO HELPS MANKIND HELPS GOD. THANK YOU, FATHER. I'LL DO MY BEST. I'M SURE YOU WILL. BILLY, I TOLD YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM THAT BUCKET. NOW SHOO. FIRST OF ALL IT WAS BEAR GREASE, THEN SOMETHING CALLED "OLD DOC SIMPSON'S SURE-GROW SNAKE OIL," AND NOW IT'S CREOSOTE. I DECLARE, YOU'VE TRIED EVERYTHING ON YOUR HAIR EXCEPT GRASS SEED. JOE BYRNE SAYS CREOSOTE'S BEST OF ALL. FOR TELEPHONE POLES, MAYBE. THE TRUTH IS, YOU'VE JUST WORRIED YOURSELF HALF BALD. BONNIE, I CAN FEEL A LITTLE FUZZ GROWING RIGHT THERE. SEE? RIGHT THERE. THAT'S THE FRINGE ON THE TOWEL. OH. 3 YEARS OF COACHING FOOTBALL AND TRACK WITHOUT A SINGLE DAY'S VACATION. AND WHEN THIS THING BEGINS TO LOOK LIKE A WATERMELON, YOU NEEDN'T COME TO ME FOR SYMPATHY. MAYBE I CAN GET SOME SYMPATHY OUT OF THOSE. WHAT ARE THEY? TRAVEL BOOKLETS. PLACES TO GO. PICK OUT ONE YOU LIKE. KNUTE, YOU MEAN FOR US? SURE. WE'LL GO WHEREVER YOU WANT. I LIKE THIS ONE ABOUT FLORIDA. OH, ALL RIGHT. I'LL GO INTO CHICAGO TOMORROW AND DO SOME SHOPPING. WHEN DO WE LEAVE? WELL, LET ME SEE. THIS IS AUGUST. NEXT MONTH IS FOOTBALL SEASON. WE WON'T BE ABLE TO GO RIGHT AWAY. WHAT ABOUT AFTER THANKSGIVING? NO, NO. I'VE GOT TO ATTEND A COACHES' CONFERENCE IN PITTSBURGH. WELL, AFTER CHRISTMAS, THEN. JANUARY. THAT'S THE NICEST TIME IN FLORIDA, ANYWAY. NO, NOT FOR ME, BONNIE. I GOTTA TALK TO THOSE BOYS AT MOOSEHEART, ARRANGE OUR SCHEDULE FOR NEXT YEAR, THE TRACK TEAM STARTS TO WORK IN MARCH-- THAT BRINGS US INTO JULY. AND THEN FOOTBALL SEASON BEGINS AGAIN. I SEE. YOU KEEP THOSE. NEXT YEAR, TURN THEM IN FOR A NEW SET. OH, NOW, BONNIE, DON'T BE UNREASONABLE. AAH... OH, BILLY, NOW LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE! YOU-- IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT. YOU AND JOE BYRNE'S CREOSOTE. ALL RIGHT, IF IT'S SO FUNNY, GO UPSTAIRS AND WASH HIM YOURSELF. GO ON, UPSTAIRS. AND DON'T USE MY GUEST TOWELS. I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE OF YOU IS THE BIGGEST BABY. HI, BONNIE! WELL, HELLO, BOYS! HELLO, BONNIE. WHERE'S ROCK? HE'S UPSTAIRS GETTING BILLY READY FOR HIS NAP. DID YOU HAVE A NICE VACATION, BOYS? SWELL! GREAT! JIM, HOW'S YOUR MOTHER? OH, GOOD. FINE, THANKS. Moore: I SEE YOU STILL KEEP THE ICEBOX IN THE SAME OLD PLACE. YES, AND THAT ICEBOX IS NOT GOING TO BE RAIDED THIS YEAR. I'LL TELL KNUTE YOU'RE HERE. Michael: NOW, BONNIE, IS THAT REGULAR? HOW DO YOU EXPECT US TO EAT THAT APPLE PIE YOU MADE? Jim: YEAH, AND THAT CHICKEN. BONNIE COOKS THE BEST FRIED CHICKEN IN TOWN. YOU SAID IT! BONNIE, YOU WOULDN'T LET US STARVE, WOULD YOU? I BET THAT ICEBOX IS CHOCK-FULL OF GOOD STUFF RIGHT NOW. COME ON. LET'S TAKE A LOOK. NOW, BOYS, I WANT YOU TO STAY OUT OF THAT ICEBOX. I AM NOT RUNNING ANOTHER TRAINING TABLE FOR NOTRE DAME. TELL ROCK WE'RE HERE, WILL YOU? WE WON'T GO NEAR IT, SO HURRY UP. * THERE IS A BOARDINGHOUSE FAR, FAR AWAY * * WHERE THEY SERVE HAM AND EGGS 3 TIMES A DAY * * WHOA, WHOA, THE BOARDERS YELL * * WHEN THEY HEAR THE DINNER BELL * * OH, HOW THE EGGS DO SMELL * * FAR, FAR AWAY * THERE IS A BOARDINGHOUSE FAR, FAR AWAY * * WHERE THEY SERVE HAM AND EGGS 3 TIMES... * KNUTE, YOU'VE GOT TO GET DOWNSTAIRS RIGHT AWAY. THAT FOOTBALL TEAM OF YOURS IS ABOUT TO GET INTO MY ICEBOX. THEY'RE BACK? AND TELL THEM TO STAY AWAY FROM MY CHICKEN. THAT'S OUR SUPPER. IT WAS OUR SUPPER. THANKS, BOYS. THANKS. WELL, DIDN'T YOU OVERLOOK THIS? FEET APART, MACK! COME ON, DIG IN. NO, JOE, SHIFT OUTSIDE THE TACKLE! THAT'S MORE LIKE IT. ALL RIGHT, HIKE! ALL RIGHT. THAT'S ENOUGH. RELAX. WHAT HAVE YOU BOYS BEEN DOING ALL SUMMER-- FOXTROTTING? YOU LOOK TERRIBLE. YOU BETTER GO ON HOME. ALL WE NEED IS A LITTLE MORE PRACTICE, COACH. WE'RE TOO FULL OF FOOD RIGHT NOW, ROCK. WAIT TILL OCTOBER. WELL, WE'LL HAVE A PRETTY FAIR BALL CLUB THIS YEAR, I GUESS. YOU GOT A TOUGH SCHEDULE. NEBRASKA, PURDUE, INDIANA, AND THE ARMY, AND THEY'RE ALL TOUGH. WHAT I'D GIVE MY RIGHT ARM FOR IS A HALFBACK WHO COULD CARRY THE MAIL, A FAST BOY WHO COULD RUN, PASS, AND KICK. SOMEBODY ON THE ORDER OF-- THE ORDER OF JIM THORPE. A GUY LIKE THAT WOULD NEVER COME TO A LITTLE SCHOOL LIKE NOTRE DAME. I KNOW. I KNOW. THAT SORT OF FELLA COMES ALONG MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE IN A COACH'S LIFETIME. BUT I'M STILL HOPING. AND IF I EVER DO FIND A BOY LIKE THAT... WE'LL JUST HAVE TO PUNT AND PRAY THIS SEASON. THAT'S THE ONLY OFFENSE NOTRE DAME'S GONNA HAVE. IF WE ONLY HAD ONE GOOD HALFBACK, ROCK. JUST HAVE TO KEEP PRAYING, THAT'S ALL. NO, NO, MURPHY. KEEP THAT TOE POINTED AND KICK WITH THE ARCH OF YOUR FOOT. WAIT A MINUTE. HOLD IT. NOW, YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THAT. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE HOLDING, A HOT POTATO? Player: LOOK AT THAT. WOW, LOOK AT THAT BALL TRAVEL. MUST HAVE GAS IN IT. HEY, YOU! HEY, YOU! WHERE YOU FROM, BUD? CALUMET. YOU EVER PLAY FOOTBALL? SOME, IN HIGH SCHOOL. BASEBALL'S MY DISH. DON'T YOU LIKE TO PLAY FOOTBALL? NOT MUCH. I JUST SAW YOU MAKE THAT KICK. YOU THINK YOU COULD DO IT AGAIN? YEAH. Player: RIGHT IN THERE. GO IN AND GET A UNIFORM, REPORT TO THE SCRUBS. WHY? 'CAUSE I THINK YOU'D MAKE A FOOTBALL PLAYER. TRY IT ANYWAY. I DOUBT IT. ALL RIGHT, IF YOU INSIST. NO, WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? GIPP. GEORGE GIPP. WHAT'S YOURS? IS HE KIDDIN' ME? ALL RIGHT, COMEDIANS, COME ON. SNAP INTO IT. LET'S GO. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. 26-72-23. HIKE! YOU MISSED HIM, CASSIDY! USE YOUR HANDS! THEY NAIL YOU EVERY TIME! IT'S ALL RIGHT. FRESHMEN'S BALL. I DON'T WANT TO DISTURB YOU, GIPP. DO WE BORE YOU? AH, I GOT NOTHIN' ELSE TO DO. MAYBE I CAN FIX THAT FOR YOU. WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY? WELL, I HAVE BEEN SORT OF WONDERING WHY YOU GAVE ME THIS UNIFORM. GET IN THERE AT FULLBACK WITH THE SCRUBS. I DON'T KNOW YOUR SIGNALS YET. THEY'LL GIVE YOU THE BALL. YOU JUST RUN WITH IT. HOW FAR? YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. HOLD IT! ALL RIGHT, BOYS, EVERYBODY UP. HEADS UP, FELLAS. BOYS, THIS IS MR. GEORGE GIPP. FRESHMAN FROM CALUMET HIGH SCHOOL. MR. GIPP HAS KINDLY CONSENTED TO CARRY THE BALL FOR THE SCRUBS. JUST CALL ANY PLAY YOU LIKE, ANY AT ALL. THEY'RE ALL THE SAME TO HIM. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO! LET'S GO, BOYS, LET'S GO. WATCH THIS. OUGHT TO BE GOOD. 48-15-72, HIKE! HERE WE GO! I GUESS THE BOYS ARE JUST TIRED. NICE GOING, ROCK! CONGRATULATIONS! THANK YOU. [REPORTERS ALL SHOUTING AT ONCE] HOW ABOUT A STORY, ROCK? YOU'RE BIG NEWS THESE DAYS. THE PUBLIC WOULD RATHER READ ABOUT YOU THAN THE WORLD WAR. THAT'S RIGHT. COME ON, ROCK, SPILL OUT. TELL THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE BOYS, NOT ME. THEY DO THE WORK. THEY SHOULD GET THE CREDIT. WHERE'S THE GIPPER, ROCK? WE WANT A PICTURE OF YOU TWO TOGETHER. WELL, COACH! I JUST WANTED TO DROP IN AND TELL YOU THAT I CERTAINLY CLEANED UP ON NOTRE DAME TODAY. YES, SIR, $3,000. AND I'M BETTIN' 500 ON YOU AND GIPP FOR NEXT SATURDAY, LAYING 2-TO-1 THAT YOU WIN BY 14 POINTS. YOU WON'T LET ME DOWN, WILL YOU? NOPE. I WON'T LET YOU DOWN. BUT I CERTAINLY WILL LET YOU OUT. WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY USE FOR GAMBLERS AROUND HERE. YOU'VE DONE YOUR BEST TO RUIN BASEBALL AND HORSE RACING. THIS IS ONE GAME THAT'S CLEAN AND IS GONNA STAY CLEAN. YOU PLAYED A GREAT GAME TODAY, GEORGE. KNUTE'S BEEN PHONING EVERY 5 MINUTES. HIS OFFICE IS FULL OF NEWSPAPER REPORTERS WAITING TO SEE YOU. OH, ROCK CAN TAKE CARE OF THEM. HELLO, BILLY. COME HERE. LET ME TAKE A LOOK AT YOU. GEORGE, YOU'RE WONDERFUL. WELL, THANKS, BILL. YOU LIKED THAT BALL GAME, THEN, HUH? YEAH. DID YOU HEAR ME YELL WHEN YOU RAN BACK THAT KICKOFF? SURE, I DID, BILL. THAT'S WHY I KEPT RUNNING. GEE, WAIT'LL I TELL THE KIDS THAT! THAT-A-BOY! YOU'RE A STRANGE PERSON, GEORGE. HERE YOU ARE AT THIS VERY MINUTE THE BIGGEST NEWS OF ANY BOY IN AMERICA, AND YET YOU DELIBERATELY RUN AWAY FROM ALL THAT FAME AND PUBLICITY. WHY? OH, I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE TO GET TOO CLOSE TO ME. NOBODY GOT CLOSE TO YOU TODAY, GEORGE. GEORGE, KNUTE AND I OFTEN TALK ABOUT YOU. WE'D LIKE FOR OUR 2 BOYS TO GROW UP AND BE JUST LIKE YOU SOME DAY. YOU MEAN TO PLAY FOOTBALL? NO, NOT JUST THAT. TO... TO HAVE YOUR POISE AND THOUGHTFULNESS. AND YOUR INTELLIGENCE. DID, UH...ROCK SAY THAT? YES. HE SAID THOSE QUALITIES ARE RARE IN A BOY YOUR AGE. NO, BONNIE. ROCK'S THE RARE ONE, NOT ME. THERE'LL BE NEW FELLAS COMING ALONG YEAR AFTER YEAR, A LOT OF THEM MUCH BETTER FOOTBALL PLAYERS THAN I EVER WAS. THERE'LL NEVER BE BUT ONE ROCKNE, HERE AT NOTRE DAME OR ANYWHERE ELSE. HE'S GIVEN US SOMETHING THEY DON'T TEACH IN SCHOOLS, SOMETHING CLEAN AND STRONG INSIDE. NOT JUST COURAGE, BUT A RIGHT WAY OF LIVING THAT NONE OF US WILL EVER FORGET. UM... DON'T TELL ROCK I SAID THAT, BONNIE. HE'D THINK I WAS AN AWFUL SAP. OH, THAT'S FUNNY, GEORGE. HE SAID THE SAME THING ABOUT YOU. "THERE'LL NEVER BE BUT ONE GIPPER, NOT HERE OR ANYWHERE ELSE." I'M GOING TO GET SOMETHING FOR THAT COUGH OF YOURS. I'M ALL RIGHT. IT'S JUST A LITTLE SORE THROAT. DON'T ARGUE WITH ME, GEORGE GIPP. I'VE BEEN TAKING CARE OF BABIES AND FOOTBALL PLAYERS FOR YEARS. COME ON, BILL, SAY GOOD NIGHT TO GEORGE. GOOD NIGHT, GEORGE. GOOD NIGHT, BILL. NOW, SCOOT. HURRY UP. SO THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE HIDING, HUH? WHAT'S THE MATTER, YOU TOO BASHFUL TO COME BY AND HAVE YOUR PICTURE TAKEN? I DIDN'T WANT TO HORN IN ON YOUR PARTY, ROCK. THEY GET ONE OF YOUR PROFILE? MUST BE PRETTY NICE TO READ WHAT A GREAT FELLA YOU ARE. ON SATURDAYS, ANYWAY. HAVEN'T GOTTEN THAT FAR. THIS PAPER SAYS YOU'RE A GENIUS. THAT SO? LET ME SEE. THERE IT IS. "ANY COACH CAN LOOK LIKE A GENIUS WHEN HE HAS A HALFBACK LIKE THE GIPPER." WHY, YOU... WELL, THEY'RE RIGHT, GEORGE. THEY'RE RIGHT. AS LONG AS YOU'RE IN THERE, I LOOK PRETTY GOOD. YOU'VE MADE A REPUTATION FOR ME. THE TEAM IS GONNA MISS YOU LIKE A RIGHT ARM NEXT YEAR. I'M GONNA MISS YOU, TOO, GEORGE. WON'T SEEM LIKE THE SAME PLACE WITHOUT HIM HANGING AROUND, WILL IT, BONNIE? HE'LL BE BACK. HERE, GEORGE, DRINK THIS BEFORE IT GETS COOL. THANKS, BONNIE. WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? GEORGE HAS A SORE THROAT AND A VERY BAD COUGH. THAT SO? SIT DOWN IN THE LIGHT. LET ME SEE. IT'S NOTHING SERIOUS, ROCK. THE SEASON'S OVER, ANYWAY. WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THE SEASON? LET ME TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. GET OVER THERE IN THE LIGHT. OPEN YOUR MOUTH. WIDE. I'M ALL RIGHT. YES, YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE FINE. YOU'RE COMING WITH ME. ANYBODY'D THINK YOU WERE STILL IN THE ARMY. I SAW ENOUGH IN THE ARMY TO KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU. BONNIE, WE'RE GOING TO THE HOSPITAL, HAVE HIM LOOKED OVER. THIS IS A SICK BOY. GET YOUR THINGS, GEORGE. AMEN. GEORGE. YES, ROCK? GEORGE, THIS TELEGRAM JUST ARRIVED FROM WALTER CAMP. YOU'VE BEEN NAMED FULLBACK ON HIS ALL-AMERICAN TEAM. ME? YOU WOULDN'T KID ME, ROCK? NO. IT'S ON THE LEVEL. YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT, KID. I HAVEN'T GOT A COMPLAINT IN THE WORLD, ROCK. I'M NOT AFRAID. WHAT'S TOUGH ABOUT THIS? ROCK... SOMEDAY WHEN THE TEAM'S UP AGAINST IT... AND THE BREAKS ARE BEATING THE BOYS, ASK 'EM TO GO IN THERE WITH ALL THEY'VE GOT AND WIN JUST ONE FOR THE GIPPER. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'LL BE THEN, BUT I'LL KNOW ABOUT IT. I'LL BE HAPPY. YOU BETTER GO ON HOME, BONNIE. I'LL ATTEND TO EVERYTHING. 1, 2, 3, 4! 1, 2, 3, 4! 1, 2, 3, 4! 1, 2, 3, 4! 1, 2, 3, 4! 1, 2, 3, 4! 1, 2, 3, 4! 1, 2, 3... Boy: WHAT KIND OF TEAM WE GONNA HAVE THIS YEAR, ROCK? HEY, COACH, REMEMBER ME? SURE, I DO. SAME OLD GANG, HUH? SURE. YOU COULDN'T DO WITHOUT US. WHO'S GONNA TAKE THE GIPPER'S PLACE, COACH? HOW ABOUT GIVIN' US A FOOTBALL, ROCK? YEAH! YEAH! YOU ALWAYS DO. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, NOW, WAIT A MINUTE. I WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU REMEMBER FROM LAST YEAR. SEE WHO CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION. NOTRE DAME'S BALL, OUR OWN 20-YARD LINE, ARMY'S LEADING 13-7, THIRD DOWN, ONE MINUTE TO GO. TOMMY, WHAT PLAY WOULD YOU MAKE? END RUN. NO, THAT'S WRONG. ELMER, WHAT WOULD YOU DO? UH, FLAT PASS TO KILEY? WRONG AGAIN. PETE? OFF TACKLE! YOU'RE WRONG, TOO. ISABELLE, WHAT WOULD YOU DO? WELL, IF I WAS RUNNING THE TEAM, I'D CALL 83 OR 84, A LONG FORWARD PASS. SURE, YOU WOULD, AND YOU'RE A BORN QUARTERBACK, AND YOU'VE GOT A FOOTBALL. ALL RIGHT! EVERYBODY UP! ALL RIGHT, MEN... STARTING A NEW SEASON TODAY. GOT A TOUGH SCHEDULE AHEAD OF US. WE'RE USED TO THAT AT NOTRE DAME. NOW, LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT BEFORE WE START. I DON'T WANT ANYBODY HERE TO THINK HE'S ANY BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE. AND THAT GOES FOR YOU LETTER MEN. FOOTBALL CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF TACKLING AND BLOCKING. NOBODY CAN MAKE THE TEAM IF ALL HE CAN DO IS CARRY THE BALL, PASS, OR PUNT. IF THERE'S ANY OF YOU SPOILED HIGH SCHOOL STARS WHO DON'T WANT TO LEARN TO TACKLE AND BLOCK, TURN IN YOUR SUITS TONIGHT. TURN 'EM IN TONIGHT. THE NOTRE DAME SYSTEM IS BASED ON TEAMWORK, WHICH IS A COMBINATION OF SELF-SACRIFICE, BRAINS, AND SWEAT. AND THE BRAINS COME FIRST. I ONLY WANT MEN WHO CAN THINK AND THINK FAST. ANYONE HERE WHO'S ABSENT-MINDED OR SLOW ON THE UPTAKE, CURE IT OR GET OUT! FOOTBALL IS A PLACE FOR CLEAR MINDS. NOW, I'LL EXPECT YOU TO WORK HARD. I'LL ALSO EXPECT YOU TO MAINTAIN A HIGH AVERAGE IN YOUR CLASSES. WE WANT TO WIN IF WE CAN, BUT YOU DIDN'T COME TO NOTRE DAME ONLY TO PLAY FOOTBALL. 5 YEARS FROM NOW, THE PUBLIC WILL HAVE FORGOTTEN THE BEST OF YOU. REMEMBER THAT. ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE ON A DUMMY! LET'S GO! ALL RIGHT! HIT 'EM HARDER AND LOWER! ALL RIGHT, KELLY, DRIVE ON THROUGH NOW. KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN. HIT 'EM AT THE KNEES. AT THE KNEES! ON 1, 2-- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO, O'FLAHERTY. DRIVE ON THROUGH. HIKE! WHAT IS THIS, SQUAT TAG? COME ON. DIG IN. SPREAD THOSE. SPREAD 'EM. COME ON! CHARGE! DIG IN. DIG IN, ANDERSON! WHAT ARE YOU DOIN', PICKIN' 4 COME ON! CHARGE! CHARGE! ALL RIGHT, MEN! EVERYBODY UP! EVERYBODY UP! WELL, I GUESS I WAS WRONG. YOU BOYS ARE EITHER BETTER THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE, OR YOU'RE THE LUCKIEST BUNCH OF IRISHMEN THAT EVER LIVED! PLAYED A GREAT GAME ALL YEAR. SMART. SMART, HEADS-UP FOOTBALL. GONNA GIVE YA A LITTLE TREAT TONIGHT, SOMETHING YOU HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE LAST SEPTEMBER, THAT IS, TO MY KNOWLEDGE. [CAROLINA IN THE MORNING PLAYING] IT WAS NICE OF YOU TO COME AND SIT UP WITH ME, BUT I'M SURE KNUTE WILL BE BACK SOON. THE LAST TRAIN FROM CHICAGO WAS DUE 10 MINUTES AGO. AS MEMBERS OF THE NOTRE DAME FACULTY, MRS. ROCKNE, THIS IS OUR HUMBLE WAY OF HELPING TO CELEBRATE THE TEAM'S ILLUSTRIOUS VICTORY, AND WHEN I CELEBRATE, I NEVER GO TO BED BEFORE 1:30. Bonnie: KNUTE! CONGRATULATIONS! IT WAS A WONDERFUL GAME. THANK YOU, BONNIE. IT WAS A GREAT GAME. THE BOYS PLAYED OVER THEIR HEADS, I GUESS. CONGRATULATIONS, ROCK. IT MUST HAVE BEEN A GREAT GAME. THANK YOU, PROFESSOR. I'D LIKE TO HAVE BEEN THERE. WISH YOU HAD BEEN. A CUP OF COFFEE, KNUTE? NO, THANK YOU, BONNIE. I SAW SOMETHING TONIGHT. GOT THE IDEA OF A LIFETIME-- OF A LIFETIME. PROFESSOR, DOC. I SAW A SHOW TONIGHT IN CHICAGO, CHORUS GIRLS, A WHOLE ROW OF THEM. WHAT RHYTHM. IT WAS LIKE POETRY JUST WATCHIN' 'EM MOVE, BEAUTIFUL, EFFORTLESS. EFFORTLESS-- YOU GET THE IDEA? CHORUS GIRLS? AT YOUR AGE, ROCK? NO, NO, NO. BUT THEY GAVE ME THE IDEA FOR A NEW KIND OF A BACKFIELD SHIFT. AND, GENTLEMEN, IT'LL REVOLUTIONIZE THE GAME. REVOLUTIONIZE IT! NO LOST MOTION. NO WASTED MOMENTUM. SPLIT-SECOND TIMING. I CAN SEE IT NOW. AND THE PUBLIC, THE PUBLIC'LL LOVE IT. IT'S NEW. IT'S COLORFUL. GREAT SHOWMANSHIP, AND IT'S NEW! IT'S NEW! LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN. PROFESSOR, DOC. WE'LL GO INTO THE REGULAR FORMATION. YOU'RE AT RIGHT HALFBACK. YOU'RE AT QUARTERBACK. YOU GO IN AT FULLBACK, BONNIE. I'LL BE LEFT HALFBACK. NOW WE FORM A "T" FORMATION. FROM THE "T" FORMATION, WE SHIFT INTO A BOX FORMATION. THAT MEANS YOU SHIFT TO THERE, YOU SHIFT TO THERE, BONNIE, YOU'RE BEHIND HIM, I'M AT THE TAILBACK. YOU SHIFT ON THIS SIGNAL. I'LL GIVE YOU 3 SIGNALS. WHEN I YELL "HIP," YOU DO THIS. NOW WATCH. 47, 29, 82. HIP. 1, 2, 3. YOU GOT IT? LET'S TRY IT. ALL RIGHT. 27, 81, 92, HIP. 1, 2, 3. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. LITTLE MORE ZIP. WATCH IT, PROFESSOR. WATCH IT, DOC. WATCH IT, BONNIE. ALL RIGHT, READY? HERE WE GO. COUNT WITH ME THIS TIME. 29, 85, 41. HIP. All: 1, 2, 3. THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT. ALL RIGHT, ONCE MORE. 27, 85, 49. HIP. 1, 2, 3. [PLAYING CAROLINA IN THE MORNING] 1, 2, 3. HIP. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2... HIP. 1, 2, 3. HIP. 1, 2. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT! YOU'RE ALL OUT OF STEP. COME ON, NOW. GET THE RHYTHM. THE RHYTHM, THAT'S WHAT I WANT. YOU LOOK LIKE A BRAKEMAN FLAGGIN' A TRAIN. YOU KNOW, YOU'VE ONLY GOT 2 FEET. DO THEY HAVE TO STEP ON EACH OTHER? YOU'RE CALLIN' THAT HIP ALTOGETHER TOO SLOW. THE OBJECT OF THE SHIFT IS TO CATCH THE OPPONENTS OFF-BALANCE, GET 'EM BY SURPRISE. YOU COULD KNIT A SWEATER BETWEEN YOUR SIGNALS. OH, AND BY THE WAY... I DON'T WANNA BE PERSONAL, BUT, UH... DID YOU EVER LEARN TO DANCE? WELL, I CAN WALTZ A LITTLE. KINDA THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE DOING. WELL, YOU'RE NOT CARRYIN' A BLONDE. YOU'RE CARRYIN' A FOOTBALL. ALL RIGHT, NOW, BOYS, COME ON. LET'S GET SMART. YOU CAN GET THIS SHIFT. I KNOW YOU CAN. THAT'S WHY I SELECTED YOU FOUR TO DO IT. OF COURSE IT'S TRICKY, BUT THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT. IF YOU GET IT, IT'LL REVOLUTIONIZE FOOTBALL. ALL RIGHT, PUT ANOTHER NICKEL IN THE SLOT. LET'S GO. [CAROLINA IN THE MORNING PLAYING] SIGNALS-- 18, 21, 33. HIP, 1, 2, 3. Knute: FASTER! HIP! Boys: 1, 2, 3. Knute: FASTER! HIKE! HIKE! HIKE! Announcer: WHAT IS THIS NEW MIRACLE THAT ROCKNE HAS WROUGHT? THIS BOLT OF IRISH LIGHTNING THAT STRIKES FROM ALL SIDES WITH SUCH BLINDING SPEED AND FURY. A SHIFT, THEY CALL IT. YES, BUT HEISMAN OF GEORGIA TECH ALSO HAS A SHIFT, SO HAS TED JONES OF YALE, BUT THEIRS ARE SIMPLE TUNES COMPARED TO ROCKNE'S SYMPHONY, FOR THIS SHIFT IS MUSIC, THE MUSIC OF A MASTER'S HAND. KNUTE ROCKNE, WHOSE INGENIOUS BRAIN PERFECTED THE FORWARD PASS, HAS BROUGHT A GREAT NEW THRILL TO FOOTBALL AND TO ITS MILLIONS OF FOLLOWERS. IN THE BRILLIANT HANDS AND FEET OF THE 4 HORSEMEN-- DON MILLER, HARRY STUHLDREHER, ELMER LAYDEN, AND JIM CROWLEY-- THE NOTRE DAME SHIFT HAS BECOME A PRAIRIE FIRE, BURNING NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, AND WEST, RELENTLESS AND UNCHECKED FOR 3 STRAIGHT YEARS. ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY UP! EVERYBODY UP! LET'S HAVE THE BALL, ELMER. WELL, THERE IT IS, BOYS, THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP. THEY CALL YOU THE 4 HORSEMAN AND THE 7 MULES. WELL, I'M BEHIND YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MAKES ME. BUT I DO KNOW THAT THIS IS THE HAPPIEST DAY OF MY LIFE. SAY, COACH. COACH, THIS IS THE LAST TIME A LOT OF US WILL EVER WEAR A NOTRE DAME UNIFORM. SOME OF THE BOYS THAT WON'T BE BACK NEXT YEAR-- THERE'S HARRY AND JIM AND DON AND MYSELF-- WE SORTA WONDERED IF YOU'D LIKE TO JOIN US IN A LITTLE PARTY. SURE, I WOULD, BUT THE PARTY'S ON ME. OK! YEAH! YEAH! Billy: COME ON. THROW IT TO ME! WELL, THAT SETTLES IT. AFTER THE GAME TOMORROW, WE'RE GOIN' DOWN TO FLORIDA FOR A NICE, LONG VACATION. YES, DEAR. AND, BONNIE, WE'LL SIT ON A BEACH IN MIAMI AND DO NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. YES, DEAR. ALL DAY. BY THE WAY, DID YOU PACK MY WHITE FLANNELS? I'VE BEEN PACKING THEM FOR YEARS. EVEN THE MOTHS ARE BEGINNING TO LOSE HOPE. OH, NOW, BONNIE, THAT'S NOT FAIR. ALL RIGHT, COME IN. HELLO, MR. ROCKNE. HELLO, JEFF, SIT DOWN, WILL YA? YOU KNOW MRS. ROCKNE. HELLO, ROCK, HOW ARE YOU? NICE TO SEE YOU. WHAT'S THE DOPE ON THE ARMY GAME TOMORROW? THOSE CADETS ARE GONNA BE PLENTY TOUGH THIS YEAR, ROCK. THEY THINK THEY'RE GONNA BREAK THAT 16-GAME WINNING STREAK OF NOTRE DAME'S. BOYS, THIS IS OFF THE RECORD. NOBODY CAN STOP OUR TEAM. NOBODY. THEY ALL THOUGHT WE WERE THROUGH WHEN WE LOST THE 4 HORSEMEN, SAID WE'D FOLD UP LIKE A BRIDGE TABLE. WE'VE BEEN UNDEFEATED IN 16 GAMES. WE'LL TAKE THE ARMY INTO CAMP TOMORROW JUST AS WE'VE DONE EVERYONE ELSE, BELIEVE ME. [BAND PLAYING SCHOOL FIGHTING SONG] [BAND PLAYING SCHOOL FIGHTING SONG] HIKE! HIKE! HIKE! HIKE! HIKE! HIKE! [BAND PLAYING SCHOOL FIGHTING SONG] HOW WAS I TO KNOW? YOU CAN'T EXPECT ME TO DO EVERYTHING. I'M ONLY ONE MAN. I CAN'T PLAY ALL THE POSITIONS. I MADE A MISTAKE, COACH. I DIDN'T KNOW BELSON WAS SO FAST. I--I SHOULDA CUT BACK. NO, THAT WASN'T THE MISTAKE YOU MADE. THAT WASN'T IT. YES, IT WAS. I ADMIT IT. IT WAS A MISTAKE. NO. BELSON DIDN'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE. IF YOU'D HAVE SHOWN HIM THOSE NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS YOU'VE BEEN SAVING, TELLING HIM HOW GOOD YOU ARE, HE WOULDN'T HAVE DARED COME NEAR YA. ALL RIGHT, BOYS. THE ARMY'S GOT US 13-NOTHING, AND THEY'VE EARNED IT, PLAYED US OFF OUR FEET, RIGHT OFF OUR FEET. WE'RE NOT GONNA WIN THIS SECOND HALF UNLESS WE HAVE TEAMWORK. THAT'S WHAT THIS GAME NEEDS IS TEAMWORK. GOT TO SET OURSELVES UP AS A UNIT. IF WE DO THAT, WE'VE GOT NOTHIN' TO WORRY ABOUT. WHEN WE GO BACK IN THAT SECOND HALF, WHEN YOU RECEIVE THE KICKOFF, I WANT YOU TO USE THOSE OL' HEADS ALL THE TIME. I WANT YOU TO BE SMART! I WANT THE MEN IN THAT BACKFIELD TO HIT THAT LINE RIGHT SIDE/LEFT SIDE, RIGHT SIDE/LEFT SIDE, RIGHT/LEFT, RIGHT/LEFT ALL THE TIME. GET 'EM ON THE RUN, BUT YOU'LL KEEP 'EM ON THE RUN. GO ON DOWN THAT FIELD, RIGHT DOWN THAT FIELD OVER THAT OL' GOAL LINE-- THE OL' NOTRE DAME SPIRIT! 2 MINUTES, ROCK. SAME TEAM... START THE SECOND HALF. ALL RIGHT, MEN. THEY CAN'T STOP US. NOBODY CAN STOP US. GO BACK IN THERE. RIGHT FROM THE OPENING KICKOFF, DRIVE ON DOWN THAT FIELD. DRIVE! DRIVE! DRIVE! GET 'EM! GET 'EM! GET 'EM! 4:30. I STILL CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY YOU WAITED IN NEW YORK FOR A LATER TRAIN, ROCK. I WANTED TO SLIP INTO TOWN BEFORE DAYLIGHT. THE STUDENTS USUALLY LIKE TO COME DOWN TO THE STATION AND WELCOME THE TEAM HOME, DON'T THEY? IF THEY WIN. FOR 3 YEARS NOW, THEY'VE MET EVERY TRAIN. BUT WE LOST THIS ONE. I LOST IT. WELL, THE NEWSPAPERS ARE RIGHT: I WAS TOO COCKY, THOUGHT I COULD OUTSMART EVERYBODY. I DON'T BLAME THE FOLKS IN SOUTH BEND FOR WHATEVER THEY THINK OF ME... BECAUSE I LET THEM DOWN. DON'T TAKE IT TO HEART, LIKE THIS, ROCK. THERE'S ALWAYS NEXT YEAR. BONNIE, MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T GET OFF THE TRAIN. MAYBE WE SHOULD GO STRAIGHT THROUGH TO CHICAGO AND ON DOWN TO FLORIDA AS WE PLANNED. THEN AFTER 2 OR 3 MONTHS, WELL... MAYBE THEY WON'T FEEL SO BADLY ABOUT IT AND WE CAN COME HOME. I CAN'T FACE 'EM TOMORROW. COMIN' INTO SOUTH BEND, MR. ROCK. CAN I BRUSH YOU OFF, SIR? [PLAYING NOTRE DAME VICTORY MARCH] * CHEER, CHEER FOR OLD NOTRE * * WAKE UP THE ECHOES CHEERING HER NAME * * SEND A VOLLEY CHEER ON HIGH * SHAKE DOWN THE THUNDER FROM THE SKY * * WHAT THOUGH THE ODDS BE GREAT OR SMALL * * OLD NOTRE DAME WILL WIN OVER ALL * * WHILE HER LOYAL SONS ARE MARCHING ONWARD TO VICTORY * SPEECH!

THANKS. * CHEER, CHEER FOR OLD NOTRE * * WAKE UP THE ECHOES CHEERING HER NAME * * SEND A VOLLEY CHEER ON HIGH * SHAKE DOWN THE THUNDER FROM THE SKY * * WHAT THOUGH THE ODDS BE GREAT OR SMALL * * OLD NOTRE DAME WILL WIN OVER ALL * 5:30. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE STAYED UP FOR US, FATHER. IF THE REST OF NOTRE DAME CAN, I GUESS I CAN. YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN TO ME BEFORE-- ALL THOSE BOYS. YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD WHAT THEY SAID AT THE TRAIN, FATHER-- "WHO CARES IF WE DID LOSE? WE'VE STILL GOT YOU, ROCK." AND HAVE WE STILL GOT YOU, ROCK? THERE'S BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF TALK THESE PAST FEW MONTHS ABOUT BIG OFFERS COMING FROM DIFFERENT COLLEGES. NONE OF US WOULD BLAME YOU IF YOU DID LEAVE. ANY MAN SHOULD BETTER HIMSELF IF HE CAN. WE JUST WONDERED WHAT YOU'D DO. THAT'S ALL. HOW COULD ANY MAN BETTER HIMSELF WITH FRIENDS LIKE MINE? NO, I'LL NEVER LEAVE NOTRE DAME, FATHER. I'LL NEVER LEAVE NOTRE DAME. THANK YOU, KNUTE. I'LL TELL THEM YOUR DECISION. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT, BONNIE. GOOD NIGHT, FATHER. THANK YOU. I STILL DON'T SEE HOW YOU GOT LICKED BY THE ARMY. OW! IT'S NOT INDIA RUBBER. YOU'D BE BETTER OFF IT WAS MADE OF RUBBER. I BEEN TELLIN' YA FOR YEARS, ROCK. SOMEDAY THIS LEG'S GONNA-- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. NOW GET OUT. IT'S ONLY A CHARLEY HORSE. I NEVER SAW A CHARLEY HORSE WITH VARICOSE VEINS. HUNK, LISTEN TO THIS LETTER FROM PITTSBURGH. "DEAR ROCK, "NEXT SATURDAY, "I'M GOING TO ATTEND THE NOTRE DAME/NAVY GAME "IN BALTIMORE. "NOW, ROCK, I'VE WAITED 3 YEARS "TO SEE MY SON PLAY FOR NOTRE DAME. "YOU'VE NEVER GIVEN HIM A CHANCE. "UNLESS YOU DISLIKE THE BOY PERSONALLY, "WHY DON'T YOU GIVE HIM A SQUARE DEAL? "I PROMISE YOU, HE'LL TEAR THAT NAVY LINE TO PIECES. JOHN O'FLAHERTY, CLASS 1906." MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO TAKE A JOB AT SING SING, ROCK. THEN THE ALUMNI WOULDN'T BOTHER YA. YEAH. I THINK I SAW THAT O'FLAHERTY BOY OUT IN THE HALL. HAVE HIM COME IN, GLEN. YES, SIR. "DEAR MR. ROCKNE, I HAVE A PROPOSITION "THAT CAN BE WORTH AT LEAST $10,000 A YEAR TO YOU. "ALL WE WANT IS FOR YOU TO LET US USE YOUR NAME ON A NEW LINIMENT OF OURS TO BE CALLED THE ROCKNE RUB." HA HA! HERE'S ONE FROM MY BOYS. MOOSEHEART. "DEAR ROCK, "ME AND THE OTHER BOYS UP HERE AT MOOSEHEART "HAVE BEEN READING ALL ABOUT YOU AND THE NOTRE DAME TEAM. "WE HAVE GOT A FOOTBALL TEAM, TOO. "AND WILL YOU LET US CALL OURSELVES THE ROCKNE COLTS? "WE DON'T HAVE REAL UNIFORMS, "AND WE DON'T HAVE MANY GOOD PLAYS, "BUT WE HAVE GOT LOTS OF SPIRIT. YOUR ROOTING FRIEND, JIMMY WILSON." AND HE'S GOT A POSTSCRIPT HERE. IT SAYS, "WIN THAT GAME SATURDAY." DID YOU WANNA SEE ME, COACH? YES. SIT DOWN, O'FLAHERTY. I'VE GOT A LETTER HERE FROM YOUR FATHER. FROM DAD? WHAT'S HE WANT, TO SIT NEXT TO YOU ON THE BENCH SATURDAY? NO. HE WANTS ME TO PUT YOU IN THE GAME. BUT I'M NOT EVEN GOIN', AM I? NO. YOUR FATHER HAS A LOT OF PRIDE IN YA, HASN'T HE? YEAH, I GUESS HE HAS. THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S GREAT FOR BOTH OF YA. DON'T EVER LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO CHANGE IT. DO YOU KNOW WHY I'M NOT TAKING YOU TO BALTIMORE? WELL, I GUESS I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH. NO, THAT'S NOT IT. YOU'RE GOOD, O'FLAHERTY. YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE JUST NOT BIG ENOUGH. I HAVEN'T PLAYED YOU BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO GET HURT. I'VE KEPT YOU ON THE SQUAD ALL THESE YEARS BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT SPIRIT, GREAT SPIRIT. BETTER THAN YOUR DAD'S IF YOU ASK ME. OH, HE'LL GET OVER IT. YOU KNOW HOW FATHERS ARE. I OUGHT TO. I'M ONE MYSELF. SON, I'D LIKE TO PUT YOU IN THAT GAME SATURDAY, BUT AGAINST THAT BIG NAVY LINE, YOU'D TAKE AN AWFUL BEATING. YOU MIGHT FUMBLE, LOSE THE GAME FOR US. THAT'D BREAK YOUR DAD'S HEART, WOULDN'T IT? WELL...YEAH. IF WE WIN, MAYBE HE'LL FORGET IT. IF WE LOSE, HE CAN BLAME ME FOR NOT PLAYING YOU. IN ANY CASE, IT'LL MAKE HIM HAPPY. WHAT DO YOU SAY, O'FLAHERTY? JUST... THANKS. ALL RIGHT, SON. HUNK. ADD O'FLAHERTY'S NAME TO THE LIST FOR BALTIMORE. BUT, ROCK, HE NEVER GOES WITH THE TEAM. HE'S GOIN' THIS TRIP. AND WE'LL LET HIM KICK OFF. NO. WE AREN'T READY TO MAKE ANY STATEMENTS ABOUT THAT. YES, IT IS SERIOUS. OH, NO, THE DOCTORS REFUSE TO ALLOW ANY PHOTOGRAPHS OR INTERVIEWS. YES. YES, I'LL LET YOU KNOW. WHAT DO THE DOCTORS SAY, BONNIE? CAN'T WE SEE HIM JUST FOR A MINUTE? I'VE COME ALL THE WAY FROM NEW YORK, MRS. ROCKNE. I'M SORRY. HE CAN'T SEE ANYONE. HE'S MUCH TOO WEAK TO EVEN TALK. Knute: YOU'RE CRAZY! IT'S MY LEG, ISN'T IT? Doctor: YEAH, SURE, IT'S YOUR LEG, BUT YOU'RE MY PATIENT, YOU STUBBORN NORWEGIAN. EXCUSE ME. YOU'RE A VERY SICK MAN. THE VEINS OF YOUR LEG ARE SWOLLEN UP LIKE MANILA ROPES. YOU'VE GOT PHLEBITIS, AND YOU'VE GOT IT BAD. AW, I CAN GET UP AND WALK RIGHT NOW. WHAT'S PHLEBITIS, DOC? IT'S AN INFLAMMATION OF THE VEINS. IF YOU MOVE AROUND, THERE'S A STRONG POSSIBILITY OF A BLOOD CLOT FORMING THAT WOULD TRAVEL UP TO YOUR HEART. WHAT WOULD THAT DO? WELL, YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY WOULDN'T LIKE IT. I'VE WARNED YOU ABOUT THIS FOR 10 YEARS, BUT YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN. YOU'VE LET THOSE BOYS SMASH INTO YOU YEAR AFTER YEAR, KNOCK YOU DOWN, RUN OVER YOU, AND NOW YOU'RE PAYING FOR IT. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT 20 YEARS OLD. YOU'RE 42. AND IF YOU DON'T OBEY MY ORDERS, YOU'LL NEVER BE ANY OLDER. BUT, DOC, WE PLAY THE ARMY SATURDAY. THE BOYS-- I DON'T CARE IF YOU PLAY THE WHOLE SCHEDULE ON SATURDAY. YOU DON'T MOVE OUT OF THAT BED, AND THOSE ARE ORDERS. HEADS UP, BRILL! THEY WON'T GIVE YOU TIME TO TIE YOUR SHOES IN THE ARMY GAME. 84, 46, 48. 2, 3... REVERSE! ATTA-BOY! THAT'S IT! ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY UP. HIYA, ROCK. HOW YOU FEELIN', COACH? HOW'S THE LEG? I'M ALL RIGHT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. WE HAVEN'T GOT TIME. WHAT'S THE MATTER OUT THERE, BOYS? YOU LOOK TERRIBLE-- NO FIGHT, NO ZIP, NO CHARGE! THE ARMY'S GOT YOU LICKED ALREADY. AND YOU'RE NOT FOLLOWING MY ORDERS ON THAT NEW PLAY, NONE OF YA. I HAVEN'T GOT ANY USE FOR ANYBODY WHO WON'T TAKE INSTRUCTIONS. HEY, ROCK, HERE COMES THE DOCTOR. THE DOC? GET ME OUTTA HERE BEFORE HE SKINS ME ALIVE! HOW'S IT FEEL TO TAKE ORDERS FOR A CHANGE, ROCK? BYE! ALL RIGHT, GO! [NOTRE DAME VICTORY MARCH PLAYING] WELL, BOYS... I HAVEN'T A THING TO SAY. YOU PLAYED A GREAT GAME. ALL OF YOU. A GREAT GAME. I GUESS WE JUST CAN'T EXPECT TO WIN 'EM ALL. I'M GONNA TELL YOU SOMETHING I'VE KEPT TO MYSELF FOR YEARS. NONE OF YOU EVER KNEW GEORGE GIPP. HE WAS LONG BEFORE YOUR TIME... BUT YOU ALL KNOW WHAT A TRADITION HE IS AT NOTRE DAME. AND THE LAST THING HE SAID TO ME, "ROCK," HE SAID... "SOMETIME WHEN THE TEAM IS UP AGAINST IT, "AND THE BREAKS ARE BEATING THE BOYS, "TELL 'EM TO GO OUT THERE WITH ALL THEY'VE GOT AND WIN JUST ONE FOR THE GIPPER." "I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'LL BE THEN, ROCK," HE SAID, "BUT I'LL KNOW ABOUT IT, AND I'LL BE HAPPY." ALL RIGHT. WELL, WHAT ARE WE WAITIN' FOR?! THAT'S ONE FOR THE GIPPER. BUT WE'VE GOT TO ANSWER THEM SOMEHOW, ROCK. YOU, SPAULDING, STAGG, JONES, AND MYSELF. WE'VE GIVEN THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIFE TO THIS GAME. WE CAN'T STAND BY NOW AND DO NOTHING. WE'VE COME HERE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, ROCK, HOPING YOU'D GO TO NEW YORK WITH US AND FACE THIS COMMITTEE. IT'S FOR THE BOYS, MILLIONS OF THEM THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. IT'S THEIR GAME WE'RE FIGHTING FOR. POP WARNER IS RIGHT. WE CAN'T IGNORE THEIR CHARGES. HAVE YOU READ ALL THEY'VE SAID ABOUT US? SURE. I'VE READ EVERY WORD OF IT. PUBLIC EDUCATORS, HUH? I NEVER READ SUCH A LOT OF LIES IN MY LIFE. YES, ROCK, WE KNOW THAT, BUT THEY DON'T KNOW IT. THEY'RE NOT REALLY VICIOUS MEN. THEY'RE SIMPLY MISLED. THE PUBLIC IS NEVER MISLED BY THIS KIND OF STUFF. THE PUBLIC BELIEVES ANYTHING IT READS IN THE NEWSPAPERS, KNUTE, UNLESS IT'S DENIED IN TYPE JUST AS LARGE AND PREFERABLY LARGER. THESE MEN HAVE COME TO YOU BECAUSE YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN A LEADER, AND THEY NEED YOUR NAME AND YOUR VOICE TO SPEAK FOR THEM. ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO. BUT YOU ALL KNOW I WON'T MINCE ANY WORDS. Committee member: NOW, MR. ROCKNE, THE ORIGINAL IDEA UPON WHICH ALL COLLEGE SPORT IS FOUNDED IS THAT A NORMAL AMOUNT OF EXERCISE IS HELPFUL TO YOUNG MEN AT THEIR STUDIES. DO YOU AGREE WITH THIS DEFINITION? YES... AS FAR AS IT GOES, YES. AND HOW WOULD YOU AMEND THAT DEFINITION? WELL, GAMES SUCH AS FOOTBALL ARE MORE THAN MERELY HELPFUL TO BOYS. THEY'RE AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY TO THE NATION'S BEST INTERESTS. JUST WHY IS FOOTBALL SO VITAL TO THE PUBLIC WELFARE? BECAUSE EVERY RED-BLOODED YOUNG MAN IN ANY COUNTRY IS FILLED WITH WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE NATURAL SPIRIT OF COMBAT. IN MANY PARTS OF EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD, THIS SPIRIT MANIFESTS ITSELF IN CONTINUOUS WARS AND REVOLUTIONS. WE HAVE TRIED TO MAKE COMPETITIVE SPORT SERVE AS A SAFER OUTLET FOR THIS SPIRIT OF COMBAT. I BELIEVE WE'VE SUCCEEDED. DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU'VE NEVER INTERCEDED FOR A FOOTBALL PLAYER WHO FELL BEHIND IN HIS CLASSES AND HAD TO BE SUSPENDED FROM YOUR TEAM? I MEAN JUST THAT. ANY PLAYER WHO FLUNKS IN HIS CLASS IS NO GOOD TO HIS COACH NOR TO THE SCHOOL HE ATTENDS. AND ANY COACH WHO GOES AROUND TRYING TO FIX IT FOR HIS ATHLETES TO BECOME ELIGIBLE SCHOLASTICALLY WHEN MENTALLY THEY'RE NOT IS JUST... WELL, A PLAIN, EVERYDAY FOOL. MR. ROCKNE, COULDN'T FOOTBALL BE REPLACED BY SOME OTHER GAME, SOMETHING LESS VIOLENT? WELL, WHAT GAME WOULD YOU SUGGEST? WELL, UH... HOCKEY, FOR INSTANCE. WELL, NOW, AS A MATTER OF FACT, I SUGGESTED THAT VERY IDEA TO FATHER CALLAHAN, OUR PRESIDENT. HE WAS DOWNRIGHT INTERESTED UNTIL WE CAME TO THE USE OF STICKS. AND THEN HE THREW UP HIS HANDS. HE SAID, "NO, "THAT GAME IS NOT FOR OUR UNIVERSITY. "NOTRE DAME WILL NEVER ENDORSE ANY GAME "THAT PUTS A CLUB IN THE HANDS OF AN IRISHMAN." IN YOUR OPINION, MR. ROCKNE, WHAT IS A COLLEGE FOR? WHERE DO THESE ELABORATE SPECTACLES OF SPORT FIT INTO THE SCHEME OF EDUCATION? HOW WOULD YOU GRADE AN AVERAGE ATHLETE'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE? GENTLEMEN... WE ARE LIVING IN THE 20th CENTURY. TO LIMIT A COLLEGE EDUCATION TO BOOKS, CLASSROOMS, AND LABORATORIES IS TO GIVE TO EDUCATION TOO NARROW A MEANING FOR MODERN TIMES. NOW, IF I HAVE LEARNED ANY ONE THING IN MY 20 YEARS' WORK WITH MY BOYS, IT'S THIS ONE FACT: THE MOST DANGEROUS THING IN AMERICAN LIFE TODAY IS THAT WE'RE GETTING SOFT, INSIDE AND OUT. WE'RE LOSING THAT FORCEFUL HERITAGE OF MIND AND BODY THAT WAS ONCE OUR MOST PRECIOUS POSSESSION. NOW, WE, THESE MEN AND I, HAVE SPENT OUR LIVES TRYING TO WORK OUT THAT FLACCID PHILOSOPHY, WORK IT OUT OF OUR BOYS' MINDS AND BODIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FINEST WORK OF MAN IS BUILDING THE CHARACTER OF MAN. WE'VE TRIED TO BUILD COURAGE AND INITIATIVE AND TOLERANCE AND PERSISTENCE... WITHOUT WHICH THE MOST EDUCATED BRAIN OF MAN IS NOT WORTH VERY MUCH. NOW, OUR BOYS AT NOTRE DAME HAVE PLAYED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, AND THEY'VE GOTTEN TO LEARN THAT SOUTHERNERS AREN'T LAZY, NORTHERNERS AREN'T COLD, AND MIDDLE-WESTERNERS AREN'T HICKS AND CALIFORNIANS AREN'T BIG AND DUMB. THEY'VE LEARNED FROM ALL SORTS OF AMERICANS WHAT AMERICA IS, AND IN THAT PROCESS, THEY'VE FOUND THEMSELVES. NOW, I DON'T KNOW... I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'D GRADE A BOY FOR LEARNING THESE THINGS, PROFESSOR. 50, 75, 90, PERHAPS. BUT WOULDN'T IT BE A GOOD IDEA NOT TO GRADE ANYBODY'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE UNTIL ALL THE RESULTS ARE IN? MAYBE 5 OR 10 YEARS AFTER GRADUATION, WHEN HIS RECORD AND CHARACTER ARE NOT HUNG ON THE WALL LIKE A DIPLOMA BUT INSIDE THE MAN HIMSELF? Boy: 1, 2, 3. GO! LET'S GO, YOU GUYS. COME ON. 24, 33, HIKE. Second boy: COME ON. GET HIM. JACKIE! HEADS UP! YOU MISSED HIM A MILE. [KIDS CHATTERING AND SHOUTING] THIS SUN IS WONDERFUL. SO GOOD FOR THE CHILDREN. OH, IT SURELY IS. WELL, I PROMISED YOU WE'D COME TO FLORIDA. YES, DEAR, 17 YEARS AGO. NO, NOW IT COULDN'T BE THAT LONG. 17 YEARS? WELL, NOW, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT NOW. YOU JUST RELAX. WELL, BONNIE, I PROMISE YOU IT WON'T BE 17 YEARS BEFORE WE'RE HERE AGAIN. EVERY WINTER FROM NOW ON, WE'LL TAKE THE KIDS AND WE'LL GO SOUTH, REALLY GET SOME FUN OUT OF LIFE. THAT'S NEVER BEEN VERY HARD FOR YOU. Messenger: MR. ROCKNE? OH, YES. SOMETHING FOR ME, SON? YES, SIR. THANK YOU. WILL YOU SIGN HERE, PLEASE? ALL RIGHT. OH, THANK YOU, SIR. THERE YOU ARE. THANK YOU. WHAT IS IT, KNUTE? WELL... I'VE GOT TO GO TO CALIFORNIA. BUT NOT RIGHT AWAY. YES. YOU SEE, I PROMISED THOSE MEN I'D BE THERE JUST AS SOON AS THEY NEEDED ME. HA. YOU KNOW, BONNIE, THERE OUGHT TO BE A UNION FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T SAY NO. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FLY, ARE YOU? YES. YOU SEE, ON A TRAIN, IT'D TAKE 3 DAYS. THIS WAY, I'LL BE THERE IN PRACTICALLY NO TIME. PLEASE DON'T FLY, KNUTE. YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT. BONNIE, I'LL WIRE YOU FROM KANSAS CITY. I WISH YOU WOULDN'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT. WELL, UH, DO YOU WANT TO HELP ME PACK? I'LL BE BACK MONDAY AT THE LATEST. WHEN WILL THIS TELEGRAM GET TO FLORIDA? WITHIN HALF AN HOUR, MR. ROCKNE. I'LL SEND IT RIGHT AWAY. THEY SAY THERE MAY BE A STORM AHEAD OF YOU, ROCK. WHY DON'T YOU WAIT OVER TILL THE NEXT PLANE? NO, I CAN'T WASTE ANY TIME. I'VE GOT TO BE BACK IN FLORIDA BY MONDAY. BESIDES, THIS IS MY VACATION. Attendant: PASSENGERS FOR LOS ANGELES PLANE ON FIELD, READY FOR LOADING. SOFT LANDING, ROCK. YOU MEAN HAPPY LANDING, DON'T YOU? GOOD-BYE, DOC. IT'S FROM DADDY. HE SAYS, "YOU SEE? I'M PRACTICALLY THERE. "WILL WIRE AGAIN FROM LOS ANGELES. LOVE TO ALL." WELL, IF HE'S PRACTICALLY THERE, WHY DIDN'T HE WAIT, MOMMY? BECAUSE HE KNEW WE'D BE WORRIED, DARLING. IT SEEMS TO HAVE GOTTEN COLD ALL OF A SUDDEN. YES, IT'S TRUE. ROCKNE IS DEAD. YES, ROCKNE WAS KILLED IN AN AIRPLANE CRASH THIS MORNING. Second operator: YES, ROCKNE'S DEAD. Third operator: YES, ROCKNE'S DEAD. YES, ROCKNE WAS KILLED IN A AIRPLANE CRASH. YES, ROCKNE DIED... EXTRA! EXTRA! READ ALL ABOUT IT! GET YOUR...

OF NECESSITY, WE ARE FEW IN NUMBER IN THIS HALLOWED PLACE, THOUGH THOUSANDS ARE WITHOUT THE DOORS. BUT WE REPRESENT MILLIONS LIKE OURSELVES WHO ARE HERE IN SPIRIT, LISTENING IN ALL OVER AMERICA. KNUTE ROCKNE MIGHT HAVE GONE TO ANY UNIVERSITY IN THE LAND AND BEEN GLADLY RECEIVED AND FOREVER CHERISHED THERE, BUT HE CHOSE OUR LADY'S SCHOOL. HE HONORED HER IN THE MONOGRAM HE EARNED AND WORE. HE HONORED HER IN THE PRINCIPLES AND IN THE IDEALS HE SET UP IN THE LIVES OF YOUNG MEN UNDER HIS CARE. HE WAS, INDEED, HER TRUE SON. YES... KNUTE ROCKNE HAS GONE. AND WHO WAS HE? ASK THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO DISPATCHED A PERSONAL MESSAGE OF TRIBUTE TO HIS MEMORY. ASK THE KING OF NORWAY WHO SENDS A SPECIAL DELEGATION HERE TO REPRESENT HIM. ASK THE THOUSANDS OF NEWSPAPERMEN WHOSE LABOR OF LOVE IN HIS MEMORY HAS STIRRED EVERY HEART IN AMERICA. BUT ABOVE ALL, ASK THE MEN AND WOMEN IN EVERY WALK OF LIFE. ASK THE CHILDREN, THE BOYS OF AMERICA. WHO WAS THIS MAN WHOSE DEATH HAS STRUCK A NATION WITH DISMAY AND HAS EVERYWHERE BOWED HEADS IN GRIEF?
