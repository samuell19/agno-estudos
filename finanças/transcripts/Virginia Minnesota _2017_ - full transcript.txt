[LIGHT MYSTERIOUS AMBIENCE] ADDISON: So the legend is pretty well known. Bound for safe harbor, the Viking captain sailed Lake Superior with his only daughter, sharing with her the many wonders and the legends of the great lake. But a terrible storm hit and the ship went down. The little girl was separated from her father, drifting away on a piece of the ship's debris. The Viking washed up on Encampment Island, alone and devastated. And the little girl was rescued, taken in by a native tribe that brought her in as one of their own. Convinced his daughter was still alive, the Viking rebuilt his ship. And with strength and fierce determination, he set out to find her. But the years pass by with no sign of his daughter. [THUNDER RUMBLING] Mad with grief, the Viking threw his compass into the waters, destined to forever circle the infinite lake. But the compass found its way to shore, found its way to his lost daughter. The lost daughter showed her compass to the Ojibwe mother who told her it was a sign. Her father was still out there, still alone, still searching.

But she made it to 31 years old, which is pretty good for a horse, if you ask me. I think it might have been a tick bite, but the autopsy was inconclusive. Which, of course, is a joke. LYLE: Hillman. -Oh, you're going up... -Yeah, I'm up top I guess. Okay. Oh, Hillman Sterling IV, or V, whichever it was. Well, still III, believe it or not. You don't still have a crush on me, do you? 'Cause that was, like, 15 years ago. I was finally able to move on. I'm now a married man. There's no ring on your finger. Hmm? Oh.

Your wife's a lucky woman. Yeah. Do you, do you ever tell her how you used to spy on me in the shower? I never did that. Every summer, you'd come visit and you would take the spoon and you'd slide it under the bathroom door just hoping to get a glimpse of naked Lyle. I happen to drop the spoon. It just slid under the bathroom door. You dropped the spoon a lot. Okay. The polished stuff like from the dining hall spoon rack. Okay. Sorry to hear about your aunt. Well, she wasn't a very nice woman, but thank you. You know, I was kind of surprised that she would mention me. In the will, yeah. Yeah. I wasn't even in there. No, I wasn't. All four of you girls were in there, which is--which is fine, but, legally, we can't open the whole thing until you're all present. And where are they? Brooke and Nakoda should be landing about now. Still inseparable? Yeah. Yeah. Sisters from another-- --huh, how does that phrase go? And Addison? Well, she told me she'd be here. I'm just waiting to hear back.

I just remember Moira screaming at him for keeping us up past bedtime. He said I was like a daughter once. Aww, that's because you were his favorite. Always acting like you were interested in that stupid car. It's a '55 Packard. I was interested. You were the favorite because you were the tattletale. I was not a tattletale. I was responsible.

Call her again. I'll talk to her. I tried. Her phone's off. Can't we just open the will and pretend she was here? Yeah. Lyle, will let you watch her in the shower. I will. No. That--I can't do that. Watch her in the shower, since when? Tomorrow morning, we can call Addison and see if-- I don't have until tomorrow morning. Well, I don't know what to tell you, unless you wanna drive up there and drag her back here yourself. BROOKE: Remember when Addison lit your Barbie house on fire? It wasn't a Barbie house. It wafort. Why was there doll furniture in it? The soldiers needed somewhere to sit. You're such a freak. So why don't we just go up there and get her then? I'm not gonna drive all the way up there just so she can say no to our faces. Yeah, and I'm pregnant, and I don't want to. Does anybody have her address? She just said she was working late at some tavern up there. Well, there's only one tavern in Grand Marais, so I guess I'm going.

You might wanna get cleaned up. [AIRPLANE ENGINE WHIRRING] ADDISON: Instead of the traditional bottle of champagne, the crew of the Adella Shores used a bottle of lake water to christen the ship, which any true seafarer knows is considered extremely bad luck. Twenty-one crew members went missing, never to be seen again because Lake Superior, as they say, she never gives up her dead. Show of hands how many of us have seen one of the local legends like Mishipeshu, the underwater panther? I once felt her go right by this very ship. Almost sunk us as she glided by. Or how about the wendigo of the woods? He is the scariest with his gnarled antlers and yellowed fangs. -I saw the Viking. What? What was that? GIRL'S MOTHER: She saw the Viking of Encampment Islands sailing out on the lake this morning. You, you saw the Viking of Encampment Islands,is that--that's what you said? He was looking for his lost daughter. Oh, okay. Um, right. Let's talk about the Viking. This is actually a first. I have worked this stupid job for five summers now and I have not once heard that. Since we're cutting funding and this is the Johnny Darter's last voyage before she's sold for firewood and never seen again. I'm just gonna set the record straight so nobody goes home disappointed. There is no wendigo monster. Mishipeshu never bumped into this boat because she doesn't exist. They're just knock-offs of Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster. Oh, and for the Phantom Fleet, I lived here my whole life and I have yet to see one ghost ship, but you never know, I guess. Blind faith is an amazing thing. Did I answer your question? Come to think of it, you didn't ask me one, did you? Right. And for the record, the Adella Shores didn't vanish in Minnesota, it cast off from Wisconsin and sank in Michigan.

I'm not having this conversation with you in front of the world's best doughnuts. They are the world's best doughnuts. Do you remember that time that you asked what sex was, and then I shoved my finger in a jelly donut? Yeah. I didn't have sex until I was 24 years old because of that. Thank you very much. Quit trying to change the subject. All right. They're about to open. You wanna go inside? No, I wanna have this conversation out here. Right now. In front of everybody. You know why? Because I don't care if I'm making a scene. Sound familiar? Yeah, that was me, just doing an impression of you, because we always had to stop and listen to one of Addison's problems.

That's supposed to make it easier? Yeah, you move on with your life. How have you moved on with your life, Lyle? Well, this looks like to me that you're living out of a car with a robot. Well, you're holding everybody hostage because you're too scared to go back. Nobody wants to be there, at least of all me. Least of all you. Wow. You weren't even there. So that's it then? Yup.

And then, he started walking around the whole bar, going table to table, asking for spare change. I hid in the bathroom because I didn't want you to know that I saw you. I knew you saw me.

How is this not stealing? It's not stealing. I just don't feel like seeing him right now. Why did you break up with him? Well, I--he never gets mad at anything. He drinks coconut water, he makes me go jogging with him. Also he builds these tiny boats. Like, model boats? Yup. What's wrong with that? A lot of people do that. Yeah, but he builds real boats for a living, like big boats. How are you gonna build big boats all day and then come back home, and build little tiny boats? Also, I'm not attracted to him.

I guess, I just don't really like anything that has the potential to plummet. HUNTER: How do you know Addison? We went to school together. Oh, did you go to Cook County? [KEYS CLANKING] Um, this place down in Larsmont. Oh, you were at the foster home? Uh, well, it wasn't really a foster home, technically. I mean, they weren't our foster parents.

That one is when I was actually refurbishing for our honeymoon, but when I told her about my plans for the boat, she just freaked out on me. LYLE: Well, yeah, it's a maturity thing with Addison. Honestly, it always has been. Guess I'm just worried that she's gonna do something stupid, not like, you know, I think she's a danger to herself stupid, but she's just unpredictable.

ADDISON: Larsmont's a landmark. MISTER: Searching Larsmont Bluff. See? Larsmont Bluff was a historic horse farm on Minnesota's Lake Superior coastline. The property fell into disrepair during the second half of the 20th Century, under an agreement with the State Department of Human and Juvenile Services, the foundation opened a home and school for female minor offenders, between the ages of eight and seventeen from troubled families.

[HOPEFUL MUSIC] We can take you as far as Silver Bay, but then, we must head west, I'm afraid. Are you sure you're gonna be all right from there? Yeah. Thank you so much for the show. Oh, it was our pleasure. Constructive criticism, though. Addison. What? Why do you always think I'm going to say something horrible? Uh, the, the Ojibwe were guys and the Sioux was a woman? GABRIEL: Exactly. Yeah, the, the White Man didn't torture the Ojibwe Warrior, they earned his trust and got him drunk, and then he gave the location of the mine. I didn't realize you were able to interpret the performance so accurately. And since we're doing notes, but Nanabijou didn't find a gold mine. It was a silver mine. Uh, and they never actually gave up the location of the mine. Um, that's why a Sioux warrior had to go undercover at the Ojibwe camp. But the story was pretty funny. -Funny. -Uh, except that the Sioux dudette didn't, um, drown with the White Man. -She just went crazy. -Hmm. Was there any part of the story that we did right? Oh, the tone. The overall tone. May I ask how you're so familiar with these legends? We had a friend. She used to tell them to us every night. Knew them all like the back of her hand, believed in all of them, too. Sounds like you had a very wise friend. What was her name? God bye ye, and farewell. Good bye and thank you for the lift. I will send you a post card from the city of Angels. We can walk from here. To Larsmont? I don't think so. To my mother's house. Your mother lives in Silver Bay? Yup. She, uh, turned over a new leaf, she likes to say. How long has she been out of rehab? She got her one year chip the summer I aged out of the foster program. That's convenient. Yeah. Anyway, uh, she won't be there. She goes down to Leech Lake to avoid the festival, so we can borrow her car. Whiskey. When's the last time you saw her? About six months ago. After Hunter and I got engaged, she thought it would be a good idea for them to meet first to, uh, mend the fences. Hmm? Uh-uh. Hey, what do you think is more annoying? People with co-exist bumper stickers or people who say "At the end of the day" in every sentence? I mean, at the end of the day I'm all about co-existing, but... You still have that. What? Your necklace. Yeah, why wouldn't I? You're gonna make yourself sick. Clearly, you don't know me very well. Oh, I think I have alcohol poisoning. Quit being dramatic, just make yourself throw up. I can't! You know I can't. Why? 'Cause I'm scared. Whatever. Still. Okay. Okay what? Hold your hair back. No. Oh, no, no. Okay. On the count of three. You ready? Hmm. One, two... [VOMITING AND COUGHING] Got it? Okay. You're okay. Uh-hmm. We'll run you a shower. It's already 10:00, we've got to get back to Larsmont, so if you wanted to-- ADDISON: [VOMITS] LYLE: God. [SLOW PIANO MUSIC] [WASHER BEEPING] [WASHER BUZZES] BILL: Hello. LYLE: Hi. SUZETTE: Lyle? Is that you? [SYMPHONIC MUSIC] [DINNER PARTY MUSIC] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hey. Addie, you would have loved Sandy's gallery opening tonight. Addie is an amateur photographer herself, or at least she used to be. I don't know what she's up to anymore. She never visits her mother even though she's right down the road. And since when did you start sneaking into my house young lady? I just came to borrow the car for the night. It's always, "Mom, can I borrow this? Mom can I borrow that?" I don't think I've ever said any of those things. You're not borrowing anything until you've had a drink with your mother. Mine's grape juice, Addie, don't think I don't see the look you're giving me. You know, you don't have to keep driving home the whole mother-daughter thing. Everyone in the room is well-aware of our situation. Well, she has her father's good looks. Lyle, I don't know if she told you but I've turned over a new leaf, so to say. Ugh, this wine is really bad. Last I heard, you were in, um, California or something? Yeah, I was but--then I have-- No, pookie, will you please go get that present for Addison, it's in the hall closet and it's right behind my... I know where it is. I would have mailed it to her for her birthday but you know how things go. I don't want a present. You know what, it's just a little something that was recommended by a friend. It was you Kathy, wasn't it? Come on. Just open it. Sincerely, Salads. A salad cook book for your brand new look. Well, I know it's done wonders for me. And Kathy, you used to be a house, didn't you? I don't even know what to say. You're welcome, dear. What's wrong with this cheese balls? Oh, no, no, no, they're, um, chevre truffles it's, um, it's, uh, it's onion, herbs, almonds, and a little touch of paprika. Paprika! Bill and I have taken a French cuisine. It's an online course mostly. Once a month, we're able to, uh, demonstrate our, uh, culinary progress in a class led by the great chef, uh, Andre Le Faux Hmm, he used to be a chef in Europe. Le Faux. Uh, your mom tells me your moving down to Minneapolis. I actually know a couple of people who move there from Munger. I'm sorry, who are you again? I'm Bill. Yeah, they're actually pretty good, chev, you said chevro? Uh, uh, truffles, honey. Addison, I've told you about Bill. We've been dating off and on for over a year now. Wow. Congratulations. Off and on? No, Bill, I'm not moving to Minneapolis. My fiancé and I broke it off last night. What? What did you do? Really? No, no, no, I thought that Hunter had gotten a new job in the city and didn't you put a down payment on a town house? Yeah. Yeah, he, he did. He got a new job, he put down a down payment. I, I live and work in Grand Marais. Grand Marais represent. What are you going to do to for money? I mean, you can't just work minimum wage jobs your whole life. Why not? You haven't worked a day in your life and--I mean, you're doing pretty well. By the way, I really like your new hardwood floors. Who paid for those? Ugh, what? So, you're just gonna go on welfare? I was thinking I could sell my engagement ring but then I thought, "Even I'm not that cold." I have--I have this necklace I could sell. I mean, it could be worth something. It's iron oar so, it might not be but, you know what, a little dead girl gave it to me. So, that could be worth something. You would have liked Virginia, mom. But you never came to visit me at Larsmont, did you? Larsmont Bluff, it's a home for neglected children. Mother, she used to be a bit of an addict. And if you look close enough you can still make out the track marks. That's enough, Addison. I'm not done selling stuff yet. Like, how about this vintage shirt, this might be worth something, right? Maybe this one, too. I don't know but--oh, but this, this is--this is just a scratch, right, mom? I mean, I got it when I was eight, I, I barely even remember it. This was done to me by one of mother's boyfriends. He gave this to me because he suspected her of cheating. She didn't fess up about it until he shoved the scissors half an inch into my chest, might wanna put the cheese knife down, Bill, you're making everybody nervous. [WASHER BUZZES] LYLE: My clothes are dry. ADDISON : Okay. It's been great, mom. Guessing we can't borrow the car anymore. Lyle. Yup. -Oh, and you're doing a really great work. Keep it up. Thanks for the cheese balls. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] LYLE: How'd that feel? BILL: You forgot this. Thank you. Uh, tell you what, you girls go ahead and take my two-seater, we won't be needing it anymore. Your two-seater what? I surprised your mother with a, uh tandem bicycle last month. I thought she'd enjoyed the bonding experience, but it seems some women just prefer to ride alone. There are so many questions I have for you, Bill. Oh. Anything in particular? No. Yeah. No. Yeah, I don't, but thank you. Look, the bike's over here. Why don't we go get it and have-- you girls get on your way. Right. [80'S UPTEMPO POP PLAYS] [MUSIC CONTINUES] Put the chain back on. You put the chain back on. [EAGLE SCREECHES] [LIGHT AMBIENT MUSIC PLAYS] [FIREWORKS EXPLODING] Do you hear that? Yeah. Where is it coming from? Split Rock Lighthouse is a lighthouse located on the North shore of Lake Superior near Silver Bay. [UPBEAT TECHNO MUSIC PLAYS] Looks a bit different than in our first grade field trip, eh? DARLA: Addison? ADDISON: I hate this girl. Darla, hey. Oh. What are you doing here? Hanging out. Yeah, yeah. You want a drink? You literally just threw up. I know, but we should just mingle, you know, and get us a ride back. I don't want to mingle. Come on. How can you not dance to this? I don't know how to dance. You just take a normal activity and then exaggerate it, you know, like, like fishing. Just. Throw. And reel it in. I'm gonna go clean Mister up in the bathroom. All right, you do that. ¶MUSIC CONTINUES¶ Was that my CPU malfunctioning or did I feel a spark between us? I can't do this. I've had a hundred possibilities of dropping you off with somebody better, somebody safe like a family or another traveler. I mean, those Mormon twins at Salt Lake City, they, they really wanted you but they were just weird. What's the point of being a wandering robot if I don't even let you do that? I've just been bringing you down with me, and I'm sorry. [TOILET FLUSH] It's just that-- You didn't wash your hands. Would you like to hear a joke? Yeah. Why was six afraid of seven? Because seven, eight, nine? Because seven was a robot. HOST: The steamer vanished November twenty-first, nineteen oh two. Freak gales that seemingly came out of nowhere. Egotistical mariners who challenged the Great Lake. Compasses that spun in the wrong direction because of the magnetic charge the of tons of iron ore cargo. But an equal number of these events cannot be so easily archived. ...the Bermuda Triangle. Atlantis. Loch Ness. Native Americans worship these waters, and the rich forested lands along the Western coastline. Lands that still hold intrigue and folklore of their own. The Viking of Encampment Island is--[STATIC] Dolarhyde. Steps out on--[STATIC] MARCIE: You wanna see how this thing works? The compass points north, of course, but the Iron Ore carries a magnetic charge that would confuse the compasses and send the ships crashing into the rocks, so they built a lighthouse. How do you know Addison? I saw you two coming in together. We know each other from a long time ago. Oh, yeah? From Grand Marais? Yeah. There and another place that's not too far from here. Hmm, were you at the disciplinary school? Well, technically, it wasn't a school, I mean, it-- there weren't any teachers. It was more of a structural reformation environment. I'm sorry, do you... Oh, my God. Are you Lyle? I feel like I'm meeting a celebrity. Addie talked about you all the time. She did? Well, I'm glad you followed Addie there. Can't imagine that girl being left on her own. I didn't follow her there, I mean, I was sent by a judge. Right. What? Nah, it's just--well, Addie said that you never gotten in trouble until the day she was sent away, and then, you threw a rock through a police station window. Exposition. Huh? Nothing. How do you know Addison? Oh, we used to date. -Huh? -Yeah, for like a year. I think it was too boring for her, you know Addison. Yeah. [POPPY DANCE MUSIC PLAYS] ¶FIRE YOU'RE SEEING IN YOUR SLEEP¶ ¶FLAMES ARE EXTRA FEAT¶ ¶DOWN WITH THE FEVER¶ Where's Addison? -What? -Have you seen Addison? She's having a dance off with Rhubarbara.

You know, it's a bad dialogue if you keep saying everything... It's just stupid. I have a thing for gas stations. Ah, the smell of gas. Yeah, I totally get that. Ew, no. Gross. With my travel blog, the pay is bad and hardly anybody reads it, but when I'm on the road and I run out of gas, it forces me stop and for a brief moment, while I'm filling up the tank in the middle of nowhere I realize I can go in any direction. So, what's the job in Chicago? I'd be curating products for Aqua Shop. It's like SkyMall but for cruise ships. Gross. It's better than month-to-month leases and seedy motels. Is it? Hey, Addie, you wanna ride up front with me? I'm not falling for that one. It worked once before. Hey, you wish. What? I didn't know you were... Gay? What, what are you then? Bi?

[CRICKETS CHIRPING] [INDISTINCT LAUGHTER AND SPEAKING] HILLMAN: It's a big chair. Moira wanted me to give you these, you can review them on your own. It's not much but she hoped it might be helpful or meaningful in its own way. Why are you yelling? HILLMAN: She also wanted me to read you this letter. So--yeah, here it goes. "I'm okay now, Moira is fine too. She told me she's sorry for not letting me draw my legends, but if you go north from where I hid them, maybe you can find me." Um... What? HILLMAN: That's all there is. What does that mean? Draw my legends. Virginia used to get in trouble for drawing monsters, UFOs, the wendigo. I don't really know what to make of this. Let me see that. That's Moira's handwriting. Yeah, she wasn't really herself there in the end. I know everybody leaves in the morning, so if you could just take down the Christmas decorations. It'll help me in getting the house ready for the sellers. I don't know about you guys but, um, I'm still processing everything, so I'm gonna go upstairs. Yeah, me, too. BROOKE: We're still processing here. Well, hold on. You promised me that if I put up the Christmas decorations that you would take them down. Moira just died, man. Insensitive much? Okay, good luck with that. BROOKE: Unbelievable. HILLMAN: Well, hold on.

LYLE: Yeah, it's kind of creepy. What do you think that letter meant? I don't think it meant anything. I've been meaning to give you this. We could've used this back at the falls. No. It doesn't work anymore. No, it does. You just pull that little thing. Hmm? Oh. I was supposed to be the navigator that night. Virginia never told me what the inscription meant. You cannot destroy one who has dreamed a dream like mine. YOUNG VIRGINIA: What, what time--? YOUNG ADDISON: Shh. [WAVES CRASHING] [BOAT CLATTERING] [BEAUTIFUL MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYS] ADDISON: Lyle? [MUSIC CONTINUES TO PLAY] [PIANO BEGINS TO PLAY] [THE SOUND OF LIGHT WAVES] [CINEMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES] [LIGHTHEARTED MUSIC CONTINUES] [CINEMATIC MUSIC INTENSIFIES AND BECOMES TRIUMPHANT] [CLATTERING NOISES] [SYMPHONIC MUSIC BUILDS] What are you doing out here? It's the boat. What? It's the same boat. It's not the same boat. Yes, it is. Look at the logo on the side. It's the same one. That company used to make a lot of boats. I'm telling you, it's the same one. The long scrape on the side, it's the same shape. You were on that one, remember? It sank. Virginia and I, we carved our initials into the boat. Addison, stop it. No, no. I'm gonna just show you. -We carved our initials-- -You're freaking me out. Stop. Don't touch me. Okay. Initials, you carved them where, here? Show me. There are no initials. What are you expecting to find out here? She wanted us to come back here for a reason. Virginia didn't want us to come back here. That letter was written by a guilt-ridden old lady who had completely lost her mind. All you're doing is bringing up stuff you're gonna regret. That I'll regret? Because you don't regret anything, do you, Lyle? So what? You think she's, um, she's leaving you clues? Is that it? That she's alive and well, or maybe she's talking to us from the other side, I don't know. Here are your clues. Let's see. Um, is this what she wanted you to find? A half-sunken boat that a bunch of kids got drunk in? I'm pretty sure that's a condom on your leg. [BOTTLE SHATTERS] There's no plot twist. You have to let go of what happened and stop blaming yourself. You know, that's the funny thing, you know, everybody blames me because I was there that night, and I have carried that with me my entire life. But nobody ever thinks to blame you. Why would they blame me? I was the one that was always watching out for her. I told you guys not to come out-- But, you know what? Maybe this isn't the boat, maybe it's not, but you weren't there that night and that is on you. Of course, I wasn't there. I'm not a freaking idiot. And I'm not gonna take a little girl out in a boat in the middle of the night so she can go search for her imaginary father. Look, she was gonna go out on the water that night with or without us. And you know what? I, I didn't go there to help her find some Viking. I went there because I'm her friend. And I was gonna be there for her when she finally realized there was nobody looking for her. Yeah, you were there for her, all right. You know, maybe if you didn't tell on her all the time, maybe she wouldn't even think to sneak out. Lyle, the tattletale. I was protecting her. You let her do whatever the hell she wanted. -You were not trying to protect her. You were just getting us hit with the belt. You told on her again and again, and again. If you could just let her believe, if you just let her figure things out on her own... When did I not let her figure things out on her own? Oh, I don't know, maybe Santa Claus? Okay. She needed to know why we were the only people that weren't getting presents on Christmas Eve. She thought Santa hated her because she was an orphan. She needed to know the reality. Because you know all about reality, right? You, you drive around the country with a robot pretending to be its mother. I mean, the metaphor there is so pathetic, it makes me want to throw up, and I hate throwing up. Well, somebody needed to be the parent. She was just a little girl. So was I. I was just a kid and you should've been there. You should've been there with me and you weren't. I was just a kid, too. [MELANCHOLY PIANO PLAYS] [PIANO MUSIC CONTINUES] Virginia! Virginia! Virginia! Virginia! Virginia! YOUNG LYLE: Addison, where's Virginia? YOUNG ADDISON: I--the, the boat flipped. -What happened? -I don't know.

We'll see stars in the morning, rainbows at night, friendly trees we tell secrets to, and we know, we'll sleep well on this island where wishes come true.

CHLOE: She's in the trading post. You remember yesterday? On the tour when you asked me about the Viking of Encampment Island? -Yeah. -Yeah, I was having a bad day. Do you want to know what really happened? [CINEMATIC MUSIC PLAYS] ADDISON: So, the legend is pretty well-known. The Viking who lost his only daughter went mad with grief, sailed on Lake Superior for decades trying to find any sign of her. But the legend mostly focuses on Encampment Island where most of the sightings were reported, but no one knows just how far and wide he travelled. I do, though. How? Oh, I knew his daughter. When she was a baby, she was abandoned in a hospital in a town called Virginia. It's a couple of hours inland. That's sad. Yeah. Yeah, that is sad. And they told her she had no family but she didn't believe that. She believed that fate had brought her from one town over to this house on the coast where she and I met. And her father, the Viking will be able to find her because she was in the water now. I have never met someone who believes so strongly in something. She didn't understand how people could believe in one thing and not believe in another. The same people that believed in God would laugh at her for believing in ghosts and wendigo monsters, you know, underwater panthers, but just because I have never felt Mishipeshu bump the side of this boat, that doesn't mean that someone else hasn't. Why is faith so selective? How can you believe in one thing unseen and not believe in another? [MISTER BEEPS] After knowing Virginia, I started believing in everything. But, you know, something happened along the way and-- I don't know. But I'm, I'm slowly coming back around. [MELANCHOLY PIANO MUSIC] Did she ever find her father? What do you think?
