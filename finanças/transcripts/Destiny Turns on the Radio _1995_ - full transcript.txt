ANNOUNCER: Nevada prison officials are scratching their heads this morning over the disappearance of bank robber Julian Goddard, who escaped during last night's electrical storm. Goddard was serving time for his part in the daring Silverado bank robbery three years ago in Las Vegas. Goddard's unidentified accomplice was never apprehended nor was the money ever recovered. Sounds like it's going to be a busy day for cops and robbers alike. Ah-choo! ( horn beeps like the Road Runner ) ( beep beep ) Need a lift? Matter of fact, I do. I'm going to Las Vegas. Where else? ( car doors close ) ( engine starts ) ( Ned Albright's "The Seventh Son" playing ) MAN 1: What are you, a gambler? MAN 2: Who isn't? Name's Destiny. Johnny Destiny. MAN 1: Well, I appreciate the ride. '68 Road Runner, right? This baby's a '69. 446 barrel. Air-grabber hood with a coyote duster. Sweet lines. Friend of mine had one just like this, only his was a '68. Same color too. He used to call it "monkey-bottom blue." Yeah, well, nothing beats Detroit iron. JOHNNY: Vegas. That's a town. Anything can happen there. You know what I mean. I don't have to tell you. It's an explosive situation, that's what it is. You got men looking for women. Women looking for men. And they're all looking for money. Quick money. The whole town's a tinderbox. "Lucille." She why you goin' to Vegas? Hey, you don't have to say anything. I know what's goin' on. Johnny Destiny has seen that look before. She's beautiful, isn't she? Heh heh heh heh. Heh heh heh heh heh.

I can do it myself. Dirty shyster. Oh. Gold chains dripping off his neck, and he leaves me a lousy 20 bucks. Johnny, is that you? Is it really you, Johnny? It's me, sugar. In the flesh. I'm sorry, Johnny. I couldn't control myself. It's ok, honey. You sure are a sight for sore eyes, Johnny. I've been rolling snake eyes ever since you left. Bad luck. That's all it was. Repeat after me. Luck changes. Luck changes. It always does. It always does. See ya later, amigo. See ya around. I doubt it. ( car door closes ) JOHNNY: Well, you never know. It's a town of limitless possibilities. ( car door closes ) Johnny Destiny. How ya doin', Thoreau? Julian. Three years late, but I made it. Better late than never. I heard about you on the radio this morning. Oh, yeah? Yeah. The news fellas was comparing you to Harry Houdini. I kinda figured I'd see ya headed this way. Yeah. You're probably not the only one. Well, what do you think of the place? It's all mine now. You didn't buy it, did you? Well, let's just say I acquired it. Well, I gotta hand it to you, Thoreau. I mean--I mean, it really-- it really looks like shit. The universe is expanding, Julian. It's beyond one man's power to stem the tide of chaos. You can make an attempt. At least put some water in the pool. That ain't no pool. That's the devil's watering hole. THOREAU: So... Have you seen Lucille yet? Nah. I came straight here. So what's the shot? Well... I want my share of the money. Then what? And then I'll get Lucille. Mm-hmm. And then after that, I figure I just... I head for the border and just... just keep on goin'. Just me and Lucille. That sounds like a hell of a plan. I'm glad you like it. I do. Couple of problems, though. First off, Lucille hasn't exactly waited for you. Well, she didn't leave town, did she? No. She's still here, but she's Tuerto's girl now. He's a big shot now. He runs the Stardust. Ohh. Ohh. Well, this is... this is truly... truly offensive. Aah. ( glass shatters ) Aah! Aah! ( crash ) Oh, Lucille. Now... you said... that, uh... there were a couple problems. Yes, I did. Well, let me have it. It's about the money, Julian. Thoreau... I spent three long years in prison dreamin' about that money. Whatever you do, don't tell me it's gone. It's gone. What do you mean...gone? I mean...gone. As in...away. Do you wanna know what happened? No. I wanna hit you again. I--I didn't lose it. I didn't squander it. I was robbed! It wasn't my fault. Ooh. You went back for Lucille. Oh. That's what screwed things up. Can you hear me, Julian? All right, for the sake of the rest of this conversation, I'm just gonna assume you can hear me. Now, you left me here in this God forsaken place... with all that damn money. I was a sitting duck. Oh. You know, I figured-- I figured you could take care of yourself. You know, I just don't get it, Thoreau. I just don't get it. I mean, you had a gun, a car. You had your wits about you when I left ya. You are seriously underestimating the power of the forces which were aligned against us, Julian. What are you talking about? What am I talking about? I'm talking about the inescapable forces of fate. I'm talking about fire and water! Oh, no. No, no, no. Don't tell me you gone and got God on me now. Please don't tell me. I'm not putting any names on him, but he was here, and he stole our money! He? Tell me there was more than one. One was enough. THOREAU: If you recall, we had an appointment at Silverado Bank, but, of course, you and Lucille had to choose this particular moment in time to have a relationship talk. You promised me that we would leave tonight. You promised me. We need some traveling money, don't we? Huh? After tonight, we're gonna be on top of the world. Then what? And then--and then we'll leave this God forsaken town. With the cops chasing us? There ain't gonna be no cops. Julian! Thoreau and I got it figured out, baby. It's gonna go like clockwork. What if something goes wrong? Nothing's gonna go wrong. Julian, let's leave now. Forget about the bank. We don't need the money. Let's get out of here before it's too late. Don't--don't worry, baby. You wait here, and I'll be back before you can say Acapulco. You have this power over me. It is ripping me in half. Part of me wants to stay, but the other part of me wants to clear out of here right now. Which part wants to stay? THOREAU: Now, we'd done more than our fair share of thievin', but we never managed to get ahead. The cash in that bank vault would make idleness a way of life. ( tumblers open ) ( yelling instructions ) THOREAU: The wheel of fortune was most certainly spinning in our favor. That is until we got back to The Marilyn to pick up Lucille. Sweetheart. I'm back. LUCILLE: Don't try to find me. Just know that a piece of my heart remains yours forever. Lucille. Smell that. Ha ha ha. I'm not picking that up. That goes out of your share. She's gone. Let's get the hell out of here. I gotta find her. What about the cops? Fuck the cops! I gotta find her. Wait here. I do not support this decision! THOREAU: Well, I waited, just like you said. The hours passed. I knew something was wrong, but I just kept on waiting. ( thunder ) ( indistinct whispering ) ( thunder ) When I woke up... car was gone, money was gone, this pool was empty. What's up with you, Thoreau? What the hell you still doing here after three years? I'm waiting. People left, this place fell to ruin, but I'm still here, and I'm waiting. For what? He's coming back. That pool means something to him. I hate to disappoint you, Thoreau, but there ain't no way in hell this guy's coming back. Whoever he is. Well, you never know. It's a town of limitless possibilities. Why did you say that? I don't know. It just popped into my head. Why do you say anything? Aw, it's...it's nothing. Guy that dropped me off was driving a car just like yours. Only his was '69. Julian, mine was a '69. Thoreau, yours was a '68. It was mine. I owned it and I'm telling you it was a '69. Aw, it's just a coincidence. Like hell it is. Plymouth only made 615 446 barrel coupes in 1969. And 388 of those were four speeds. Now you figure the odds on that. What the hell do you think you're doin'? He played me for a sucker once. It ain't gonna happen twice. This time, I'm ready for him. Thoreau... What about all the lightning? Non-conducting rubber soles, my friend. I'm always thinking. ( car honking ) RALPH: All right, bring up the reds. Yeah, okay. Yeah, well-- give me a hint of blue. A hint. Okay, yeah, all right, now turn slowly, baby. All right. Turn around. That's it. That's it. Beautiful. Beautiful. Ok, mark it. All right, come on down, sweetheart. How come the band's not up there? Because the band's not auditioning for a record contract, ok? You are, ok? And don't be afraid to show some tit, you know, open up a little bit. I mean, honestly, you know, nothing makes a song sound sweeter than a little tit. Ralph, you're a dirty bastard, you know that? Yeah, well, ok. You only get one shot with this guy, so don't fuck it up, ok? All right, now pay attention to me, ok? Now, uh, all right. I got it fixed, ok, so he's gonna be sitting right here, ok? Here he is, ok? Ok, now, he's here, "Oh, boy, I can't wait for the show. "I heard this girl's really good. "I don't know. Maybe she's not. I don't know. Let's see." What you do is just play it cool. Work the crowd. "Hey, how you doin'? Good to see ya here." Da-da-da-bing. Badda-boo. But this is the guy you got to play to, all right? Give this guy what he wants. This is where you lean right into him and, "Hooray! Wonderful. She's the best in the world. Sign her up. Give her a car." But you're gonna be terrific, baby, ok? You're gonna be great. He's gonna love you. I love you, ok? Now get out of here. Go home and get some rest and have a snotch. Snotch--it's like a nosh and a snack, I guess. Hey. Boss wants to see you. Pronto. Thanks, Francine. So who's the geek with the shiny head? Who? The nervous guy in the lounge. Oh. His name's Ralph. Ralph Dellaposa. He's an agent. A real smooth operator from L.A. He thinks I might sound good on records. Really? Does Tuerto know about this? No, he doesn't. And he's not gonna find out, either. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Not until I get my ticket out of this town. Well, my lips are sealed. Thanks. ( door closes ) Oh, you really ought to get out more. I mean, spend some time with people. Goin' to see Lucille? Ah, well, you know... sure thinkin' about it. My great-great-grandfather once said, "Beware of all enterprises, that require the use of new clothes." Now, tell me something. Where did you get these mod threads, man? Well, the kind of people that stay here tend to disappear in the middle of the night. Or they kill each other. Either way, I wind up with their stuff. You seen my father lately? I heard he was camped out up north. Hey, you better hide that face, desperado. Hey, Thoreau. I knew you'd wait for me. I knew you'd be back. iHola, mi amigos! Oh, what brings you boys back to town?

I'm not sticking around long enough to fall in love. Then you should've left yesterday. ( horn honks ) All right. So what's the bottom line? Atlantic City? Come on, Herb. Come on, cut the crap. What? Hey, fuck the numbers! That's bullshit. Bullshit! You're talking bullshit. Shut the fuck up, Herb. Look, I believe in Vegas because Vegas is Vegas. It's not some has-been grimy shithole. It's a town of limitless possibilities. Herb, have you been to Atlantic City, huh? Well, it's depressing. I spent three days there. You know what happened? I lost my tan. Yeah, and then I lost my self-respect. No! Absolutely not. No money goes to the east coast. None. Zero. Call me when you got a better idea. Jerk. Accountants are all the same. No style. Hey, baby. Mm. TUERTO: Beautiful, ain't it? Life doesn't get more beautiful than that, baby. Look at that. Somebody just won. Lucky bastard, huh? You wouldn't have won that big in Atlantic City, pal. Ahem. Francine said you wanted to see me. I do. What about? I just want to see you. Well, take a good look because I'm going home. Wait, wait, wait. Come on, honey. Sit down. Have a drink or something, will ya? Did you get anything to eat? Let me order you something up. What do you want, a fruit plate or something? Tuerto, I don't have time. Time? What is time, Lucille? It's the middle of the morning. I never see you anymore. You know that? Get off my back, Tuerto, ok? I just--I need some rest. Ok. I just thought maybe we'd have a conversation or something. That's all. I'm not in the mood for conversation. Ok. Ok. But when you are, let me know what you think of these numbers I picked for you. What, are you crazy? This isn't my style. Cher sang this lineup at Bally's last week. Why argue with success? What is it with you? Your underwear too tight, or what? Excuse me? You keep touching your thing. You're always touching your thing. So? Why, I just wanna know. Are you checking to see if it's still there? Hey, back off. It's there! Stop worrying. Hey, Tuerto don't worry about his thing. Keeps me company, that's all. Which is more than you've been giving me lately. What's with you all of a sudden, huh? What's up your ass lately? When's the last time we made love, you and I? Every time I touch you, you give me the big freeze. I don't have to take this. It's so cold between us, I have to wear snow shoes to bed. When you climb into bed, the automatic thermostat kicks in. And what's the matter me grabbin' my thing? I can grab my thing anytime I want to grab my thing! It's my thing, it's there for me, it's arm's reach, who gives a shit? You know, a woman in your condition shouldn't smoke. Wise choice. Lucille! Aah! Ah! What? Ralph, you scared me. Sorry. Listen, you have to nix that nap. But I got great news for you. Vinnie Vidivici wants to have lunch with you. I thought you said he wasn't getting into town 'till tonight. He checked in early. He calls me from his suite, says he wants to meet you before the show. I say lunch, he says Chinese. I say noon, he says 12:30. Some dumb luck. Now, be on time. Vinnie Vidivici does not do lunch unless he means it. What should I wear? I don't know. Just the way you are is fine. Oh, hey, hey, hey. I know. Show some... Right. Ha ha. ( car honking ) JULIAN: Lucille! ( honking car ) ( whispering ): Ahem. Okay, I'm just gonna walk straight. Need a lift? Hmm. I thought you were in prison. Well, they let me out on good behavior. When did you get into town? This morning. When are you leavin'? Well, that all depends... On what? How long it takes you to pack. It has been three years, couldn't you just leave it alone? Oh, no, baby, it's been left alone too long. Come on, sweetheart. Let's vamoose out of these parts. Come with me. Anywhere you want to go. I'm talkin' about Zihuatanejo, Tierra del Fuego... Julian, you know what-- You name it... I don't need this today. I really don't need this. I got plans--I got big plans. And they don't include you. Oh, you got big plans? Big--big plans. Ah, well do these big plans-- they include Tuerto, I suppose. They include me, all right? So, just leave me alone, you're nothing but trouble. Hey, what's the matter? Move your car, eh! Come on, move the car! Can't you see I'm talkin' to my girl here? Like I give a shit! MAN: He don't give a shit! Move your car or I'll move it for you, you son of a bitch. MAN: Son of a bitch! Oh, you're gonna move the car for me, huh? You're gonna move the car for me? Let go! THOREAU: Marilyn Monroe, you drove men crazy with desire. Where's Goddard? Detective Dravec. Gage. Julian Goddard. Where is he? Oh, last I heard, he was learning the trade of license plate manufacturing. Don't mess with us, Thoreau. He broke out yesterday. We know this is the first place he'd come. Well, you know the routine. Look around. Take a look. Sign giving you trouble, Thoreau? Ah, neon is so temperamental, these signs. You looking for this? Who are you, mister? What do you want from me? Actually, we met... but we weren't introduced. You can call me Johnny. I was hoping to have a word with you about the sorry state of this establishment. I'm particularly concerned about your pool. My pool? Your pool. ( Thoreau groans ) You want me to fix the pool, I'll fix the pool. Make sure it doesn't leak, I'll make sure it doesn't leak. Then maybe you'll get off my back! Eat that. ( sniffles ) Hey, you're Johnny's friend. From this morning. You cry a lot, don't you? ( sniffles ) It's that louse! I thought things would be different, but I should've known better. You can't tie down a guy like Johnny. Yeah, well, you know what they say about love... What? I can't remember. But it was right on the money. Oh. Listen, about Johnny, you know where I can find him? Nobody finds Johnny, he finds you. Hey! ( tires screech ) I mean, some schmucks might blow a lot of hot air at you about taking the public's pulse, like the public has a heart or something. Well, Vinnie Vidivici is here to tell you that the public has no heart. Huh? Take it from me, this business is nothing but a craps shoot. That's pretty funny coming from such a successful guy like yourself, Vinnie. Hey. Ain't that right, Lucille? Ain't that right, what I just said? That is definitely so, Ralph. You know, honey, I'm doing Ralph here a favor. Nobody, but nobody, comes to Vegas looking for fresh, new talent. This is where careers go to die. Jeez. The whole place, if you ask me, it just stinks of formaldehyde. I hope you're not wasting my time here, Ralph. What? Are you serious, Vinnie? I would never waste your time, you know. 'Cause I know how important time is to a gentleman of your stature. So I-- VINNIE: Good. Ok. Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta go to the can. Oh, ok. We'll wait for you outside, Vinnie. Ok. Do that, please. What the hell is wrong with you? We're sitting here eating lunch with a guy who can make or break your career, and you're staring at the fish like what's going on in there's more important. Sorry. Well, you know, forget about it because I tell you, you know, despite your efforts to screw up, you know, I think he likes you. Come on. No, he does. That's just his way of saying, "Hey, cutie, what you know? Hey." Oh, please. No, it is. I mean, what's not to like, huh? You feeling ok? I mean, you haven't even touched your Mu Shu at all. Let me grab some of this before-- I'm not hungry. I need some air. I'll meet you outside. ( mumbles ) Boy, I'll tell you, those Chinese kill me. With that Mu Shu this and the sub gum, but they're cute. And I'll tell you what. Now, listen, listen. Here's what I want you to do, all right? Go home and take a bath and tuck your yourself in, get some rest. Ok? I want you looking fresh as a daisy when those lights come up tonight, ok? All right? I'm serious. You need to relax. And you know, you-- what, you know him? LUCILLE: Uh, he's just some guy I haven't seen in a while. RALPH: Yeah? Why do I get the feeling he ain't just some guy, huh? Oh, he's coming over here. Ok. No, this isn't any good. No. See, I smell trouble here. No. Lucille, look, look. Listen to me. Look at me. All right? Clarity of the mind. No, no, no. Look at me. Clarity of the mind, ok? Be here. No complications today. Clarity-ness is next to godliness. Oh, hey, Vinnie, hey. Uh, I was, uh... Oh. "You will inherit the earth." What else is new, huh? RALPH: All right. VINNIE: So, where we at? I have to get back to the hotel. RALPH: Oh, come on. I'll give you a ride. All right? We'll take my car. Make sure you knock me out tonight. I will give it my best shot, Mr. Vidivici. ( mumbles ) We just broke bread. You call me Vinnie. Vinnie. All right. Where's your car? It's over here. It's next to the Jaguar. VINNIE: Next to the Jaguar? JULIAN: Lucille, come here. I just want to tell you one thing. Ok? Just wait up. Not a day went by--ok, ok. Not a day went by that I didn't think of you. Look, I never meant for you to get busted, ok? I figured if I left, you'd go on without me. Well, you figured wrong. Well, I'm not sorry. I'm not asking you to be. You could've just gone, you know. Everybody makes their own choices. I will choose you every time. Julian, you can't-- you can't just walk back into somebody's life and expect things to be the same. Things are different. I'm different. I am trying to be more serious with my life. And that's why we can't see each other anymore? That's right. No, that's wrong. What's important is you and me. Don't you tell me what's important and what's not important. I got a lot of stuff on my mind, and you--you're starting to confuse me. Hey, look at me. Look at me, baby. I love you. Is that confusing? You don't understand. I do understand, baby. I understand so much. You know that too, don't you? Oh...I was afraid this would happen. Julian. Yes, my love. There's something I gotta tell you. You tell me anything you wanna tell me. Kiss me again. Isn't that your car? JULIAN: Uh, yeah. Well, not exactly. Um... You son of a bitch! Oh. Honey, I didn't steal it. I just borrowed it. Oh, yeah! Like you were about to borrow my heart. For a joy ride. Don't do that, Lucille. Don't walk away from me. What do you expect me to do, Julian, go for a ride in your stolen car? Some things never change. Oh, that's right, Lucille. Some things, they never change! Like the way I feel every time that you leave me! You are breaking my heart, Julian. No. I'm just borrowing it, remember? Thoreau. Pappy! You ol' desert rat! Where's that errant son of mine? He went downtown to see Lucille. I knew he was here. I knew he was here. My old scar started itching last night, and I knew trouble was brewing. This scar hasn't lied to me in 32 years. And last night, I was scratching something fierce. So, at first light, I packed into the truck and set forth. You are expecting him back, aren't ya? Well, Pappy, I never expect anything from Julian. Oh, it sure is good to see you. This calls for a toast! Why don't you put your stuff up on the porch, and I'll go get us a bottle. A toast to welcome me back. ( coyote howls ) Sign says "No Vacancy" but, uh, it looks like you might be able to squeeze me in. So happens we had a cancellation. Here, fill this out. "Smith." Mr. John Smith. What an unusual name. How long will you be staying with us, Mr. Smith? Just leave it open-ended if you don't mind. All right. You're in the "Some Like It Hot" suite. Need help with that luggage? Yeah. Uh, no. I can manage. PAPPY: Something strange about that fellow. THOREAU: He's a cop. Piece of shit bike. There's a cop in the "Some Like It Hot" suite. Bingo! ( static ) Aah! Mr. Smith to dispatch. ( static ) Come in, dispatch. Come in, dispatch. Request backup at The Marilyn Motel. ( static ) ( knock on door ) THOREAU: Room service. I, uh, I didn't order any room service. It's complimentary. Delicious cookies and lemonade to make your stay here more enjoyable. All right. That's far enough. Where's your buddy? I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about. Don't play coy with me. You don't know Julian Goddard? Oh, him. He's standing right behind you. Yeah. And my shoelaces are untied. As a matter of fact, they are. God, son. You look old. Joint rough on you? Wasn't no place for a man. I wanted to get up there and visit you, but one thing led to another. You know how it is. Besides, prisons make me nervous. How's that girl you were seeing? The singer? She won't see me anymore. Ah, hell, that never made no sense. A gal like that going out with a rattlesnake like you. I reckon it's my fault. This ain't got nothing to do with you, Pappy. Don't deny me my parental rights, boy! I passed on a twisted chromosome! A doctor up in Bixby, he explained to me the whole process. He said I got an overproductive pineal gland. And I reckon you got one too. Pineal gland? Overproductive! Overproductive pineal gland. It's right here... in the back of the brain. All swollen and angry. Hardly leaving any room at all for all what else that's back there. Doctor said not to worry, though, on account of nobody ever died from an overproductive pineal gland. But I know something he can't tell from all them x-rays. I know what it does to a man, how it sets him off to the desert just to protect the ones that he loves. That's the curse of our affliction, son. It renders us incapable of living with civilized folks. Oh, maybe you, but not me. Hey, what are you doing with that hose? Giving yourself an enema? He sure as hell needs it. Heh heh heh heh. I fixed the pool. Now I'm gonna fill it. Yeah, that's all you need, Thoreau, a little project to focus on and take your mind off of things. It's for Johnny. He came by earlier. That guy was here? Yeah. I just saw him downtown. Why didn't you kick his ass? Because his butt is unkickable, Julian. He ain't like us. Near as I can figure, he's an animistic spirit. You mean like the Manitou? Exactly. What's a Manitou? Sort of like a god, with a small "g." THOREAU: Think of it this way, Julian. Millions of people come to Las Vegas to gamble. They pin their hopes and dreams on one spin of the wheel or roll of the dice. It's a ritual, like a rain dance. Or a circumcision. And this repeated act of gambling has conjured a deity. Uh-huh. And that's this guy Johnny? Exactly. It's his job to dole out the luck. And the beautiful part of it is it's all random. Wait a second. Let's just go back to the beginning. Why are you putting water in the pool? He said if I help him, he'll give us our money back. This pool's his path back to the spirit world. Well, you see? You see? Now everything makes perfect sense. Really? Yeah. I'm glad to hear you say that, Julian. To tell you the truth, I was-- I was kind of afraid you were gonna think I was off my nut. That's exactly what I think, you freak! Did something happen to you while I was locked up? Dropped on your head or something? Somebody's making a fool out of you and doing a damn good job of it. You used to be Harry Thoreau, the scourge of the west. And now you're a freaking pool man. Fuck you, Julian. Yeah, well, fuck you too. If he came around here while I was here, I would've-- I would've thrashed him within an inch of his life and demanded some kind of restitution. You wanna kick his ass so bad, tough guy, he's staying right down at the Stardust. What are you guys, pals or something? THOREAU: We have an understanding. Well, maybe I'll go pay him a visit and reach an understanding of my own with his teeth and my knuckles! ( both talking heatedly ) I call you for backup. ( continues to argue ) Guaranteed to bring you luck. All right. Thank you, sir. You're welcome. Hey, Little Joe from Kokomo. How're you doing today? Where's my taste, huh? I'll have the money for you next week, boss. I'm tired of you being late on these payments. Tell you what. You take these flowers to Lucille, we'll call it even. Yo, boss. Detective Dravec was here. Good work, kid. I get to deliver the flowers. Maybe if you throw in the shades. Oh, you drive one hell of a hard bargain. Come here. Hey, boys. How ya doing? Good to see you here. Welcome. Hey, Robert, why don't you give the boys a casino discount card? You know what? You go down to Baird's, get yourself a nice suit, all right? Comfy? Sorry to keep you waiting, boys. What can I do for you? We're looking for Julian Goddard. Goddard. Goddard's in the can. What rock do you live under? He's out. He was spotted in Vegas. What's that got to do with me? You used to know Goddard, right? Sure, I did. Everybody did. That don't mean anything. He's a nut. He's a wild man. He's completely unpredictable. It's come to our attention that he used to put the moves on your girl...Lucille. That was before she met me. She's done with him, finished, finito. She dumped him, hasn't seen him since. What about today? You are giving me a fucking headache, Dravec! Hey, don't get your bowels in an uproar there, huh? We're gonna just take a quick look around and talk to a few of your employees. You don't mind, do you? Thanks. Dravec... you do what you got to, only do it quiet. Cop noise disturbs the customers. Get it? ( sniff ) Bring the car around back quick. ( rock music blares ) JULIAN: Oh, hello there, Mr. Policeman. What do you think I am, stupid? Good behavior, my ass. ( glass breaks ) DRAVEC: You seen this scumbag? Seen a lot of scumbags. What makes this one so special? ( slap ) Ow. He was here this morning, looking for Lucille. Did he find her? I don't know, but he didn't strike me as the kind of guy who would stop looking. Satisfied? DRAVEC: Hey, let's go and talk to Lucille. Rarr. ( romantic music plays ) What are you still doing here, huh? I'm glad you stayed, but... I thought you hated Las Vegas. It's a tough town to leave. Why did you come back? Uh... the road only went one way, baby. The road...can go two ways. Oh, not for me. And not for you either. That's why you're still here. You waited for me, just like I told you. ( moaning ) ( rock music blares ) He loves me not. I love him. TUERTO: Hello, doll. Guess you got the roses. Tuerto. Why so surprised? ( toilet flushes ) Company? Tuerto loves a party. How ya doing, Tuerto? Mr. Goddard. Long time, no see. Mm-hmm. You were always a snappy dresser. Hey, would you like me to put a hem in that? No. Ok, boys and girls, we're gonna get dressed now, and we're gonna go for a little drive, just the three of us. Come on. What are you gonna do, Tuerto? I haven't decided whether I'm gonna kill him myself or feed him to the cops. Now get dressed. Come on. Oh. Oh! Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! ( muffled talking ) God, son of a bitch took Lucille! He never comes during the day. What was he doing here? I'll tell you, this shoe really comes in handy. Ok, there's a cop out front. I'm gonna duck down, and all I want you to do is just fly right by. Ok. Julian...I have to talk to you about something. Honey, this is not the time. Please, let's go. Julian, it's very important. Honey, let's go! Ok, stay down. You got three goons out here. Hi. How's it going? COP: How you doin'? Hi, fellas. Tuerto'll be right out. Nice suits. Looks like my old buddy Dravec. Punch it, baby. Let's go! I'm punching! I'm punching! That's it. That's it. I want you to blow right through the stop sign, baby. LUCILLE: Ok. Hang a left. Don't hit the brakes. Just take it real fast. Hard left. Come on. Go! Go! Go! Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Julian, honey, I really need to talk to you about something. Honey, please, please. Hit the horn. Hit the horn! LUCILLE: Aah! ( blares horn ) Look out. Look out. Aah! Aah! Ok, let's have some fun. I pull the brake, you cut the wheel. Go, baby, go! What are you doin'? Cut the wheel! I'm cutting! Whoo-hoo! Aah! That is an illegal U-turn. Yeah. We add that to the list. Come on. Come on! Hang a left. Hang a left. Lefting, lefting. We got you now, loverboy. We got you now! What the fuck is that?! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! God, I hate that. I think we lost them. Beautiful job, sweetheart. Thanks. I love you, baby. I love you too. Look at that sky. On a night like this... Julian. Anything can happen. I mean anything. Anything, anything. Come on. Honey... Marry me, Lucille. Marry me, baby. I'm all yours. Julian, I'm pregnant. Oh, no, no, no. It's not what you think, baby. It's not Tuerto's baby. No, it's yours. Mine?! Yeah. You better watch yourself, sweetie, 'cause I'm startin' to get... I'm startin' to get real mad! Julian... I haven't slept with Tuerto in a long time, and there hasn't been anybody else. It's the truth. The truth?! The truth?! The truth is that I've been in prison for three years! And, according to everything I know, two people have to be together basically in the same place to make a baby! Julian... What if we were together? I think that I would remember, Lucille. I didn't remember it myself until this morning. When I saw you down on the casino floor, it all came back to me. What all came back to you? One night about a month ago, I just couldn't sleep. I don't know why, but I got in my car, and I drove to that old motel. LUCILLE: I got real sad lookin' at that room, all messed up, just the way we left it. I guess I was hoping you'd be there somehow. ( howling ) Maybe it was just a dream. I don't know. But that's when it happened, Julian. That's when you and me made this baby I have inside of me. I don't blame you for not believin' me. I had the same dream. It's holding water. I wish Julian was here. I got a funny feeling about all this. I'm gonna go look for him. Keep an eye on things. ( people chatting happily ) Whoa. Excuse me. Sorry. WOMAN: Good luck. Congratulations. Where you taking me on our honeymoon? Oh, baby, I just figured we'd just... we'd just keep driving... Mmm. Until we run out of road. I love the sound of that. I'm gonna call Thoreau. Mmm? I'm gonna tell him good-bye. Ok. Hurry up. Be right back. Hurry, hurry. Hey. Look at that. ( telephone rings ) Ooh. Feels good. Come on, Thoreau. Come on. ( honk honk ) One second, baby. Be right there. ( telephone rings ) Surprise. LUCILLE: Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Oh, boy. Get outta here. ( takes deep breath ) Boys told me you were in your car, waiting outside some chintzy wedding chapel. What's that about? And, on top of that, I hear you and Dellaposa are marking cards behind my back. I give you a house, a car, a job. Everything you have, you have because of Tuerto's generosity. Oh, Lucille. Party's over, Lucille. I'm cashing in your chips. ( sighs ) Now get outta here. Tuerto... I played you for a sap. I'm sorry. It's just that there are... things going on with me that I can't explain, and... I don't even understand. Where you going, missy?! Hey, what are you doing?! Get your mitts off of me! What do you want, Dravec? Where's your boyfriend? I don't know. I'm tired of being jerked around here. Hey, you take three baby steps back, copper, and pop a breath mint while you're at it. Can't you see the lady's had a rough time of it? Well, maybe she likes it rough. Does aiding and abetting a fugitive mean anything to you? Come on. Tell us where he is. I told you, I don't know. That song is getting old. Where you go, he goes. What time is your show tonight? There ain't no show tonight. I just fired her. She's going on the schedule. Yeah? Says who? Says me, hot shot. Look, you play ball, or I'll shut down this tarnished Xanadu toot suite. Powder your nose, sweetheart. I want you to sing it like you mean it, 'cause I'm goin' fishin', and you are the bait. ( whispering ): Oh, Julian. You're not gonna kiss me, are you, Thoreau? Not unless you ask me real nice. ( groaning ) Ow. Somebody jacked you up, but good. Yeah. Tuerto's stooges. And they got Lucille. ( telephone rings ) Marilyn Motel. May I help you? It's him. Yeah, it seems to be holding water. Well, what--what time should I expect you? Midnight? Ok, sure. Midnight. Gimme that damn phone! Now, you listen to me, you cowardly son of a bitch! I want my-- Now, do you believe me now? Do you see what I'm telling you? It's all coming full circle! And in a little more than... Oh, hell, in no time at all, we're gonna get our money back. And all we have to do is wait! Well, that's what you do best, isn't it, Thoreau? You sit around, and you wait! Well, not me! Always sitting! Where you going? To get Lucille. Give me the keys. You're in no condition to drive. You're in no condition to stop me. Give me the keys. You can't leave. We gotta stick together this time. ( choking ) Thoreau! You're my partner and the best friend I got, and I love you like a brother, but that don't mean I won't kill you if I have to. Now, give me the keys. Ok. ( coughing ) ( small splash ) Ha ha! There's water in that pool. You know I can't swim. Looks like you're gonna have to learn. Goddamn. I can't even see 'em down there. I wouldn't go in that pool if I were you. He threw the keys in the pool. Then they're gone. What do you mean "gone"? I mean gone... as in "away." You went in that pool, Pappy? I seen some mighty strange things in the desert-- hallucinations, visitations, mirages-- call them what you will. But what I seen down there... I wouldn't go in that pool if I were you. You guys are givin' me the heebie-jeebies. I promise to bring her back without a scratch. ( snapping fingers ) Johnny, where have you been? I've been saving a seat for you. Katrina, I'm sorry. I didn't get the time. Look, I'm telling you, I'm not the guy for you, and I told you that before, ok? I'm sorry. ( snaps fingers ) Buck up, big fella. For every ending, there's a new beginning. What are you, a goddamn fortune cookie? ( Katrina crying ) Give her something, Jerry. ( snapping fingers ) Seat taken? Knock yourself out. Thank you. What if he doesn't show? You get a look at that dame Lucille? Yeah. He'll show. Hey, how do you feel? Ah, all right, I guess. All right, you look fantastic. What a package. They're gonna eat you up. I'm gonna ride shotgun on the lighting board, make sure that bozo doesn't fuck up, ok? And remember, smile at Vinnie. All right, good, you'll be great. You know your mark? All right, 15 seconds to blackout. Ok. ( applause ) ( whispering ): Psst. Lucille. Julian. I thought I'd never see you again. You've gotta get out of here. It's a trap. Come with me. I can't. They're watching me. They want you. Nobody's gonna get me. ( drumstick beats time ) ( music starts ) ( wolf whistle ) Oh, my God. Drop 'em. What the hell was that? All right, all right.

It doesn't matter. Who the hell cares, right? It's over, and the important thing is you were fantastic. ( knock on door ) Oh, come on. I told you the lady said she couldn't-- Hey, Vinnie. Come on in. Hey, enter. If I didn't see it with my own eyes, Ralph... I gotta hand it to you. You certainly can pick 'em. Yeah. This bird can sing. Yeah. Hot stuff. Hot stuff. Especially that opening number with the kiss. Oh, that'll sell records. She could be the next Streisand. RALPH: So, uh, so you liked the show? Liked it? I loved it. Yeah. Mwah. Mwah. I loved it! You touched me. I was moved, and Vinnie Vidivici is not easily moved. So, uh, what am I hearing, Vinnie? What you're hearing is that you got a deal. All right. ( door opens ) ( gasps ) Ma'am. Hi. Great show. Thanks. So, what happened? With what? The record contract. Did you get it? Oh, yeah. I sure did. So, um, I guess this all your now. JULIAN: Come on, baby, let's go! You are lookin' good. My, my. Go, go, go, go! Mmm. So, any sign of him? Nope. She still in there? Yep. Hey, you. Rowrr. They had no idea what they were doin' when they built this place. Tapped straight into the cosmos. ( Harry and Thoreau laughing ) Hey, Harry. Whoo! Good to see you. Honey, this here is my father. Pappy, this is Lucille... my wife. We got a certificate and everything. Nice to meet you, sir. Whoa. This calls for a toast. Perhaps I ought to kiss the bride myself. I notice it's coming up on the witching hour, Thoreau. So where's the bogeyman? He'll be here. Well, he better make it snappy, or else I'm liable to turn into a pumpkin. LUCILLE: Hey, everybody, look at this! It's glowing. Why does it do that? Yeah, Thoreau, why does it do that? Wish I could tell you. Honey, scooch away from the side there. Listen. No, it's not a good idea, baby. Uh, this--this pool is busted, ok? ( thunder ) ( thunder ) It's all there. Mister, I don't know what your game is, but at this point in the evening, I say let bygones be bygones. Come on, Thoreau. Let's split it up. ( thunder ) ( water crackles ) Surf's up. ( crackles ) What's down there? Well, Lucille, that's all the roads you didn't take, and that's all the choices you didn't make, and that's all the numbers you didn't bet on. That's everything that could have happened had things been different. Looks like we travel in style. Come on, Lucille. Let's hit the road. ( siren approaching ) With cops chasing us, Julian? This ain't no time to play games, baby. We gotta get out of here. Let's go! Lucille, come on. Lucille! No. You gotta go, Julian. I'm not goin' with you. You love me, don't you? With all my heart. Love... love is all that matters, baby. Listen, baby. We can never be together in this crazy world. What are you talking about? You've just gotta go. Go now, before it's too late. I ain't goin' nowhere without you. No. Goddamn it, Julian! Just go! I ain't goin' without you! Damn it, Julian! Get the hell out of here! Go! What are you talking-- JOHNNY: Julian! You could come with me. I--I ain't goin' nowhere. I ain't goin' nowhere without her. You're a cute couple. Well, don't think it hasn't been fun. Freeze, Goddard! Drop the bag! Drop it! Easy! Hands in the air! Keep 'em up! Move it! JULIAN: Ok, fellas. You got me. I'm clean. Real slow. Slow and easy! I got nothin' on me. Got nothin' on me! I'm clean. Come on! Come on! I'm just takin' it off. Back away from the girl! Real clean. Move it! I gotta hand it to you guys. You're really good. All right! On the ground! I guess you were right, Lucille. We'll never be together in this world. Get down! Get down! Hit the ground. So long, fellas. ( water crackling ) Where'd they go? Did we get 'em? I don't know. Where the hell are they? DRAVEC: I saw them get in this pool. I did too, Ed. All right! Nobody move! Now, I don't know where the hell your buddy got to, but you ain't goin' nowhere, except maybe the Federal penitentiary if you got in that bag what I think you got in that bag. What bag? That bag. Oh, this bag. That bag. G-go get it. I-I'm not goin' in that pool. What? Go in the pool and retrieve the evidence. GAGE: You go in the pool and get the evidence! Are you saying that you're not gonna go-- That's exactly what I'm sayin'. ( sucking ) ( pop ) ( gurgling ) ( Smith screaming ) ( thud ) Now, who the hell are you? Ahh. Sergeant Kaminsky, sir. Code name: Smith. Arrest that man for aiding and abetting a fugitive. Get out of the pool, moron. Eddie, what are we gonna tell 'em downtown? Nothin'. Absolutely... nothin'. ( moaning ) Where do you think they got to? Don't suppose we'll ever know. At least they're together. Damn shame about that money, though. What are you talking about? I'm talking about how you could throw your take of the loot into the--into that abyss. ( whines ) That there's my cut. So what went down there? A bag of your dirty laundry. Switched 'em. Hope you don't mind. Are you kiddin'? I hate to do laundry. Let's have ourselves a drink. You'll stick around a while? No. I had enough excitement for a spell. First light, I'm gonna head on back to the desert. Well, you always have a room here if you want it. I appreciate that, Thoreau. Wouldn't think of stayin' anywhere else. ( coyote howls ) LUCILLE: Julian. JULIAN: Yes, my love? ( giggles ) Kiss me again.
