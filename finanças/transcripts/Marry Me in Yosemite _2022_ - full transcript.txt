Nice. I can't find a spot. All right, just lean back... and I'll help you down, okay? Okay. Lower away. - All right, lowering. - All right. Nice. Whoo! All right, all right. Good job. Ugh, it was a little scary up there. - Not as easy as it looks. - No. All right. Who's next? - Zoe Best is in the house. - Harris! It's nice to see you. How are you? Never better. - What do you think? - It's wonderful. I heard the book-signing was a huge success Yeah, I couldn't believe the turnout, especially after that one newspaper called my photos "high school yearbook poses." Ahh, forget about that one review. Your photos are great and your book is selling. Hm. I can do better. Of course. That's why I wanted to see you. I've got an idea for your next book. Really? You've done a great job documenting Chicago and the Midwest. Now I want you to take on the West, starting with Yosemite National Park. Wow. Yosemite? I... I've never even been there. All the better. You'll bring fresh eyes to the place. I want you to reveal Yosemite like no one else has ever done. I like the idea of focusing on photography. Nature photos as art. But here's the thing: I need everything in two months. - Two months? - This will lead our fall collection. Leave that to me. But I need you to get started ASAP. - How many pages? - A hundred or so photos with very brief essays this time. Okay. As soon as I get your contract. It's all right here. This could be the start of a whole new line. Zoe's Best of the West. Yosemite... then Santa Fe, Big Sur, the Rockies. But Harris, it's impossible to do any better than Ansel Adams. He was and always will be Yosemite's master photographer. And a national treasure. But this book will be your vision of Yosemite. I know, it's just... it's a little intimidating following Ansel Adams' footsteps. This will be a breakout book for you, Zoe. I really believe it. Okay! Awesome. Hello? Hello?! - Zoe? - Harris! Just checking to see if you made it to Yosemite. Yes, I, uh, got here a couple hours ago. The drive was fine. I love it here already. Good, good. Can't wait to see the photos. Keep me posted. Will do. Okay, bye! Man... - Hi, good morning. - Good morning! - My name is Zoe Best. - Sage Morning Star. It's my first visit, and this place is spectacular. Welcome to Yosemite. Thanks! Are you here for a permit? - A permit? - Yeah, for campsites in the wilderness. Oh, no, no, no. I'm working on a book. My publisher sent me out here. - A book on Yosemite? - That's right. I'm taking photos of the park as it is today. Well, this place is a photographer's dream. It really is. Listen, I was wondering. Do any of your park rangers offer guided tours? Oh yeah, there's lots of organized hikes led by rangers. Well, I think I'm looking more for a guide, someone who understands the ecosystem and the famous landscapes. You could hike to most of the famous vistas from here. You've got Yosemite Falls, you've got the valley, El Capitan from the Meadow. Hm. That sounds easy enough. But, hey, the ranger talks really do help. I would check it out. Thank you so much. Actually, I think I might know someone who can help you. He knows the ecology better than anyone. He used to be a climber. - A climber? - A rock climber. But he's sort of, um... off the grid. But if you can get his attention, he really knows his stuff. I'm intrigued. What's his name? Jack Hawkins. He's a naturalist. A naturalist? He knows the natural order of things, from plants to people. My grandfather actually runs this small little outfitter shop just outside the park. He might know where to find Jack. Where's the shop? Hello? Over here. There we go. You ever seen a woolly bugger? No, I think that's my first. You lookin' for a guide? As a matter of fact, I am. Well, you've come to the right place. Springtime fishing is great, but you're gonna need some help. Oh! No, I'm... I'm not here for the fishing. I'm looking for a guide named Jack Hawkins? Are you? Is he in some kind of trouble? No, no, no, uh... your granddaughter, the park ranger? - Sage? - Yeah. She said that you might be able to connect me with Jack. Hm. I haven't seen him in a few weeks. He pops up, then disappears. Huh. I, uh... the next time I see him, I'll let him know you were looking for him. Thanks. It's a great shop. Do you get a lot of climbers in here? Oh yeah, all the time. Hm. I understand Jack is a climber. Climber, guide, carpenter. Interesting. Jack's one of these all-around capable guys. Does a little bit of everything. Do you happen to know where he lives? We did a blessing of his land, up in the mountains. A blessing? I love that. There's an unmarked road back towards the park off Highway 120, just past Coldwater Springs, on the left. Thanks... Kosimay Wilson. Friends call me Kos. Zoe Best. It's lovely to meet you. Zoe, give me your hand. This will take you there. Thank you. Beethoven's Ninth from Chicago's Orchestra Hall, June 27th, 2017. Bravo! What the... Bravo! Stop that! Okay, okay. That was really magnificent. Wait a minute. First, you ruined my fishing, and now this? - That was you? - Yeah! I don't know who you are or what you're doing here, but now would be a good time for you to leave. I'm sorry about the fishing, but your performance here today, wow. Are you Jack Hawkins? Yes. I'm Zoe Best, a photojournalist. Kos said I could find you here. Kos. Yeah. I don't care what Kos said, okay? It's time for you to leave. Okay. I hear you loud and clear. Don't worry, I'll show myself out. Good. Bye! You know, I was there, by the way. Orchestra Hall in Chicago, June 2017. It was incredible. You know... I was there too at Orchestra Hall. Best concert ever. Top ten. Are you from Chicago? No. I was just there that weekend for the concert. What is it that you want? I'm looking for a guide. I do coffee table books based on my photos. Picture books for couch potatoes. Uh, no! People really like them. Yeah, armchair adventurers. My last book was on small towns. It sold really well, too. What do I know? My next book... Your next coffee table book. Is on Yosemite. I wanna capture the history. John Muir, how it was discovered. Art-like photos of everything. You know, a million photographers have been here and done that. Well, I just need help finding the famous landscapes. You should buy a map, they're all on there. I wanna go off-map. Finding new and different images. This isn't a theme park, okay? People die when they go all gung-ho into the mountains. Well, that's why I need you. You know the park and I don't. Fine. I get it. You're not into it. Probably not. You know what I think? No, I don't know what you think. I think that you're naive and a little dangerous. But I also think that you need some help. How long do you need? A week, give or take, just to get the photos. Okay. Okay, you'll do it? I'll do it, but I have one rule. Which is? You do what I say when I say it. The mountains are dangerous. You got yourself a deal. We get started tomorrow. Mm, a week from tomorrow. After I take care of a few things. No, no, no, no, I... I have a deadline. We need to get started now. Sorry! This was a giant waste of time. You know, I'm gonna go discover Yosemite on my own. Suit yourself. Just be careful where you're going. Thanks... for nothing. - Morning. - Hey! - So, did you find a guide? - Uh, that would be a no. Jack was tied up? Jack was insufferable. Yeah, he can be a little testy. - A little? - Well, he's got that confirmed-bachelor edge. But he's the best I know. Too bad it didn't work out. I did some research last night, and I'll be just fine on my own. You wouldn't happen to have a map, would you? Um, a few. Here. Thanks. I assume you're starting with day hikes, - no overnight permits needed? - Right. I'm going to take the trail to Cascade Falls and from what I read, should be a pretty easy hike on a beautiful day. Careful... it gets a little slippery up near the falls. - Thanks, Sage. - For sure. Hello. Gah! I'm stuck. Help! Help! Help! Help! - Whoa there, bear. - Help! Go on, bear. Get outta here, go on! Help! Help! Help! Help! What are you doing down there? Jack! I'm stuck. All right. Gimme a minute, all right? All right, Zoe, I'm gonna throw the rope down. Keep clear. What happened? My foot is stuck. All right. I'm gonna put some chalk on it and it's gonna come right out, all right? - Okay. - Okay. - Ready? - Yeah. On three. One, two, three! Oh! Thank you. I thought I was a goner. You know, that bear was staring right at me. Do you have food in your bag? I had a protein bar. You're lucky. That's all I can say. Now what? - Start climbing. - How? You go hand over hand and your feet will just follow. What if I slip? If you slip, I have the rope. Just reestablish your footing and keep going. Okay. Good, you're doing great. Don't look down, look up. Okay, Mr. Grouch. Great. All right, you're doing great. Keep it up. Almost there! Yeah! - Good job. - Yes! Okay. I made it! You must think I'm a real knucklehead. Yeah, something like that. Someone said they wouldn't help me! Never go into the mountains alone. Okay. But you said you wouldn't take me. Don't even go there, okay? You could have died. Well, I didn't expect to see a bear. They live here. We're the visitors. Yeah, well, it'd be nice if they'd let us - just roam around. - Most of the time, they do. Just don't carry unsealed food, okay, especially protein bars. I'm really, really grateful you showed up. Thank Sage. Sage? Yeah. You told her you were hiking to Cascade Falls, she got to worrying you might do something stupid. I don't know how she got that idea. You know, you can stay mad at me, but we're kinda bonded, aren't we? What are you talking about? Well, you just saved my life. That's kind of a bonding thing, don't you think? Jack. I'm sorry. I'm truly grateful. I don't know what I would have done without you. I'll give you five days. That is it. You will? I'll take you where you need to go, you'll snap your photos, you'll head back to Chicago and never come back again. Ah! What a charming proposal. Oh, and one more thing? Gear. You can't get where you wanna go without these. And this. Are we expecting rain? - Just trust me. - Okay, is this where I go from being a city girl to a mountain girl? Something like that. There you go. Here you go. Changing room. That way. Kos, looks like I'm your best customer. Today, you are my only customer. Hate to ask, but when... Tomorrow morning, 6 a.m., Sage's office. I'll be there, all geared up. Great. - Hello! - Hey! So I heard you had quite the adventure. If you hadn't sent Jack, I can't even think about it, so... thank you. You really need to be careful out there. Things do happen. Yeah, and after all that, he still agreed to be my guide. Well, you'll be in good hands. - Hello, by the way. - Good morning. You've met my grandfather, Kosimay. It's nice to see you again. Sometimes, Jack asks Kos for advice. He knows Yosemite better than anyone. I was born here. My family goes way back. - Four thousand years. - Oh! Is that all? Give or take. We're part of the Miwok tribe. - Good morning! - Morning! - Hey, Sage, how are you? - Doing well. - Nice to see you, Jack. - Yeah, you too. Well, if you guys need any help with your planning, just let me know, I'll be over there. Awesome. - Thanks. - Thanks, Sage. And thank you for stopping by. He knows every trail. - Don't you? - Most. Here you go. I wanna make things official. Five days. Looks good to me. Let's get started. Here's a list of the places I wanna visit. The closer I can get, the better. Yosemite Falls, El Capitan, Cathedral Rocks... No problem. Yeah, I think we can knock the first three or four of these off today. Really? That's the good news. Tenaya Creek, very hard to predict. See, right here, easy access, but shadows, clouds, mists, who knows? Well, we can at least try, right? - What do you think? - Maybe, depending on the weather. I have this idea. I wanna get a photo of Half Dome, one that no one has ever taken before. That's only the most photographed mountain in the world. - Even Jack managed a shot. - Oh. Half Dome at dawn. Getting close to Half Dome can be real hard. But there's a great view from Mirror Lake. That's a great idea, Kos. You need his blessing and his wisdom. - Hm. - Thank you. All right, let's get going. Did you remember your rain gear? You know it. Wow. Yosemite Falls. What a shot. I'll use my 4x5 camera for this. It's a wide-angle lens. Great for landscapes. This is the shutter control. See the bellows? I love this camera. Now. Viewfinder... Okay, now focus... This is incredible. There it is. Wow. The quintessential Yosemite photo. It's almost too easy. Get your rain gear on, we'll get a little closer. I've never seen anything like it. All those boulders? It's called talus. It's been here since the last ice age. They're huge! You can't see from here, but there are two more waterfalls up above. The falls are terraced? Yeah. The noise is overpowering. The fountain of life. Magical. Huh! Hey! None of me. Please? Nope. Look, this book isn't just about nice scenery. It's about people like you trying to conserve it. Later, okay? Come on, one shot. I hate posed photos. So don't pose. Just jump up there and look like a guy. Perfect! You handle those cameras pretty well. Tools of the trade. So what are you? A journalist or a photographer? I went online. Oh, you did? My first love was painting. That's why I went to art school, but then I realized that you can't make a living as a fine artist. Yeah, not easy. Yeah, so I took some photography classes and I realized I have an eye for it. I'm sort of a tech geek. So no training? Well, I was in journalism before I went to art school. So lemme get this straight. Your goal is to find Yosemite's famous locations and take artsy photos. I am an artist. My goal is to find new ways to capture interesting images. Hm. Well, I'm a scientist. Wait. I thought you were a musician, you know, conducting the orchestra? Okay, you got me. Music is my passion, especially classical. Don't get me wrong, I love your art and all, but your photos just don't tell the whole story. What do you mean? I mean, Yosemite's ecology is changing. There are conservation issues, environmental concerns. Well, I was focused on the art. Gotcha. I saw your article about water conservation. I Googled you too. - Huh. - And I also saw that you wrote a book called Conserving the West. What's that about? Sustainability. Of the park? Of the West. Its water, its land, including Yosemite. Huh. That's interesting. The science, you know, conservation. It's about testing and measuring, you know? Data analysis. Your art, your photos are beautiful, but science reveals what's inside the photo. Okay, well, this might surprise you, but I'm intrigued by all that. Do you ever collaborate, you know, with other writers? Not big on collaboration. Oh, all good. I don't need your help. Look, I can get you to the famous locations, then you're on your own. Great. Just how I like it. So are there any places that show conservation at work? Oh, so now you want my help? Well, only because you're Mr. Conservation. Hey. I can show you what's happening, just no collaboration. I wouldn't think of it! - Good. - Mm! Look at those spires. It looks like they're reaching for the heavens. Cathedral spires. When John Muir arrived here in the 1860s and saw this valley, it was a full-on religious experience. Feel like I'm having one right now. "The range of light." That's what he called the Sierras. I mean, being here was like being in a cathedral. Every read any John Muir? I started reading My First Summer in the Sierras on the plane. I love his writing. He was a scientist, but he connected man's soul to nature. It's where he found God. Huh. "The grand show is eternal." That's how he described Yosemite. When I was driving through the tunnel into the valley, it was sort of like a religious experience. That's a gift. Like the Garden of Eden. And our job is to protect it. And my job is to capture it. Nice! Come on. There's a great spot for an artsy photo of El Capitan. Hey! Wait up, roadrunner! We got a schedule to keep. Hi. Merced River's at its best this time of year. How's the fishing? I wouldn't know. Someone's phone scared them all away. Oh, yeah. Uh, okay. - Thank you. - Yeah. El Capitan. How's that? Right in your own back yard. Do you ever take it for granted? I take it all for granite. Really? Sorry, bad pun, okay? Look, I get to see new things every day. Weather patterns, changing of the seasons. - I get it. - But there's a harmony to this place, how it all blends. It's almost mystical. The sheer cliff is stunning. El Cap. It's like a massive anchor holding everything in place. And people climb the face? Every day. When I drove by yesterday, there must have been 50 photographers in the Meadow taking photos. Yup. All trying to be Ansel Adams, none of 'em coming even close. That's exactly how I feel. El Capitan above the Meadow. Art? Art. Hey, look. About halfway up. Oh, I see them! How do they do that? Lotta chalk and strong forearms. They look like toy figures against a fake backdrop. They're very real. Over 30 people have been killed trying to summit El Capitan. Wow. Sage said you're a climber. I was. Have you ever scaled El Capitan? Several times. Insane. Yeah, it's not for everyone. Hey. Do you think I could go to the basecamp or something? I would love to take some photos of the climbers. Yeah. I'll take you to Camp 4 where they all hang out. It's a good bit of social history as well. - Let's do it. - All right. So cool. You know, in climbing circles, Camp 4 is Mecca. It started after World War II. Some burnt-out soldiers moved here. Some became climbers, others were just hanging out. What did the park rangers think? Well, there was tension for years. The rangers tried to evict 'em but the Gis just wouldn't leave. What happened? Well, one year, the river flooded, washed away a lot of the staff cottages, so the park services built a dormitory over here. Suddenly, the park rangers had a strong presence in Camp 4. And the climbers? Today, it's first come, first served for a seven-day permit. Howdy. - How's it going? - Good. How's the climbing today? - Splitter. - Right on. Either one of you guys summit El Cap? I did last summer. Yeah, me too. She went the nose route. In the rain. Any ascent of El Cap is major. Totally. Uh, I'm doing a photo book on Yosemite and I'm wondering if I could grab a few shots of you two? - Sure. - Sure. Awesome. Hey, where you from? - Chicago. - Me too! - No kidding. - Clark Street. Lincoln Park. What's your name? Uh, Zoe Best. Ah! I have your book. Super good. You should put us in. I... let's do it! I would love that. ♪ So keep your head up ♪ ♪ Don't ever give up ♪ ♪ It's what you make it ♪ ♪ It's now or never ♪ Maybe, um, let's come together and get a million-dollar smile. Say "Yosemite"! Love it, we did it! Fantastic, I love it. ♪ Letting go right now ♪ ♪ 'Cause it's your day right now ♪ ♪ Yeah, you got what it takes in every single way ♪ ♪ If you can just believe it ♪ ♪ And leave it all behind ♪ ♪ Yeah, let it go, let it go ♪ ♪ Keep your head up ♪ ♪ Don't ever give up ♪ ♪ It's what you make it ♪ ♪ It's now or never ♪ ♪ Leave it all behind ♪ Will that add to your book? Absolutely! You know, I love that kind of serendipity. Let me ask you, 'cause you're a climber. Why do they do it? It's just so insane. Well, there's free climbing with ropes and harnesses. That's what I used to do. It's fun. And dangerous. Not if you're cautious and prepared. And some climbers don't use ropes or anything? That's free soloing. I did a little bit of that. Never again. Wow. El Capitan is one of the most difficult rock climbs in the world, but that's what draws people. I guess it's all about the challenge. As for me, I like to keep my feet on the ground. Well, come on. I'll get you to a mountaintop, no climbing needed. Oh, sounds like my kind of mountain. That's Half Dome in the distance. I've run out of superlatives. Hey, check it out. Aww. Aww, I love this photo! Sometimes, Mother Nature shows off. She's putting on quite the show. You know, it's hard not to appreciate the park founders. I mean, their entire goal was to preserve and conserve. I want my photos to tell that story. Oh. So they're not just art for art's sake. Places like Yosemite, where nature is protected... it is a great model for sustainability. Landscapes are for observation and conservation. Not just beauty, but what's inside the photo. Art and science. If we're good to the land, then the land will be good to us. Oh. I almost forgot. Sage invited us over for dinner. Well, more you than me, but... I figure I'll tag along. A home-cooked meal sounds great. We're here! Come on in! Nice to see you again. Nice to see you! I'm so glad you guys could make it. Thanks for having us. This place looks great. Staff housing. You know, those WPA guys really knew how to build a cabin. I love the Craftsman look. Come on, make yourselves at home. Uh, Jack, there's wine on the table for y'all. Awesome. Thanks. Um, so, how was your day? Now I know how Alice felt when she arrived in Wonderland. Look at that! "Moon and Half Dome." You know, I've taken some spectacular shots, but none of them are this good. Ansel Adams was something special. - Thanks. - You're welcome. So, any highlights from your day? The whole day was a highlight! But I loved getting close to El Capitan. - And Cathedral Rocks. - Mm, where we met John Muir. Jack's muse. We all follow in his footsteps. You know, back in the day, developers had turned Yosemite into a tourist trap. - Really? - Yeah, it's true. So John Muir knew he had to do something about it, so when Teddy Roosevelt visited in 1903, he took him camping down in Mariposa Grove. That photo's incredible. That camping trip led to the preservation of Yosemite Valley. It's true. No John Muir, no Yosemite National Park. Here's to John Muir. And to those who were here before him. - Aho. - Aho. I see that you've added to your library. Zoe's Best of the Midwest. Yeah, I picked it up at the Ansel Adams Gallery. I didn't know that. Thanks, Sage. I understand why you're like focusing on Yosemite's landscapes, but most of the photos in your book are of people. I want to get beauty shots, but I also like human stories. Like, today we ran into climbers at El Capitan. I had to restrain her from getting into a harness herself. The climbers had great stories. Maybe your book can also tell our story. Absolutely. It's part of history, right? I like your Alice in Wonderland analogy. You know the line "curiouser and curiouser"? When you dig below the surface here, it can get a little complicated. Like? White people tend to think they discovered Yosemite. It was never undiscovered. My great-grandfather was born here, and his father was born here as well. The Ahwahnechee were here all along. Ahwahnechee? The original people of Yosemite Valley. Part of the Miwok tribe. There were hundreds of them living here, right? Their cedar huts were scattered throughout the valley. One family here, another family there. Plenty of fish and deer for food. It was a good place. Then the miners arrived during the Gold Rush, thought they'd discovered paradise. That's when trouble began. There were a lot of tragedies, and not just a culture clash. As I understand it, there was a bounty on our people. A vigilante group called the Mariposa Brigade led sort of an invasion of Yosemite. Many were killed or forced onto reservations. That's so sad. America's past is not perfect. It's complicated, and there is a lot of pain, but it's all a part of its story. Do any Indigenous people still live in the park? The last were gone by the 1960s. But their spirit is still here. They'll never leave. I want to take photos of some of the historical places. There's plenty in the park. Tenaya Lake and Creek. The Ahwahnee Hotel and even Half Dome. And as they say, a picture's worth a thousand words, if it's the right picture. - Harris. - I'm looking for John Muir. Is he around? - He's everywhere. - Good, good. - He's the man, you know. - So I hear. You need to dig into his writing. I'm on it. I'm also digging into the Native American past. It's tragic but it's important. I agree. So it's going well? This place is spectacular. I mean, you should see El Capitan. Send some photos. We ran into some climbers scaling the wall. It's intense. - Did you find a guide? - I did! Yeah, he's an interesting guy. Former rock climber. I think you'd like him. - He was even quoting John Muir. - Hm, sounds perfect. Yeah, he also did some writing. Wrote a book called Conserving the West. - Hm, I've heard of it. - And we're just getting started. I can't wait to see where it leads. Don't forget your deadline. Right. Right, right. I'm on it. I'm just imagining 200 years ago when the Ahwahnechee people lived here. They just picked such a beautiful place. So peaceful. Yeah, it's like Sage said. History can be painful, but the more we know about our past the stronger our future can be. - How's this? - Yeah, that's great. - Great. - Perfect. I went to the gallery today. A present. Conserving the West by Jack Hawkins. Thank you. You're welcome. There's a whole section on water conservation. Our most important resource. Look. I know I said I don't need your help, but I was wrong. You know more about Yosemite than I ever will. How 'bout you help co-write the book with me? Like I said, I'm not big on collaboration. I know. But... If I were to get involved, I write as a scientist and you write as a journalist. And you're good, too. Thanks. But I don't think our styles would mesh. How about you write sections under your name and I write sections under my name? I might go deeper than you want. I'll take my chances. This might work out. You can highlight conservation and help me find photos to go with your points. Maybe. I do have one ground rule though. Here we go. I'm in charge. You do what I say when I say it. You're the book boss, I'm the trail boss. Even-steven! Okay, Zoe Best. You got yourself a partner. Yes! Woo! That shot is incredible. Do you see that rainbow? We do what we can. Jack. I think this is the best photo I've ever taken. Really? It's pure magic. Ah. Is this your art-at-a-new-level shot for the cover? Maybe. Well, I'm glad for you, seriously. I've always wanted to know what's at the end of a rainbow. Me too. Woo! Careful. Woo! Whoa! Careful, Zoe. - Oh. - You all right? - Yeah, sorry. - It's all right. Let's just take a break for a minute, yeah? - Okay. - Yeah. Everybody should have a guide like you. You've been awesome. Well, I bet you say that to all the boys. I do, but this time I actually mean it. Well, I don't love guiding, but sometimes it works out. Thanks to your friend Sage. I'm glad she connected us. Yeah, you weren't so happy on that first day. You were such a grouch. Yeah, you were invading my space. I needed a little help. Yeah, you were pretty lost. I was lost. I was hoping that you would just turn back around and head back to Chicago. And now? And now... I'm seeing the park through your eyes, as art. And I love it. Sage says that you are a confirmed bachelor who lives alone in the woods. I'm happy. Okay, so I'm just gonna ask you this. Between us and the mountains... Does it ever get lonely living there alone all year round? No. No, I mean... It just seems like... There's plenty going on even in the winter. But no love life up here? If you're trying to make me a profile in your book, let's just stop right there. I agreed to write about Yosemite, not about me. No, it's just inquiring minds want to know. Have you ever been in love? Are you always this nosey? I'm a journalist. No. You're kidding. You asked, I answered. And the reason is... I don't need a reason. So you like living alone? - How 'bout you? - Me? Yeah. Well, if I'm gonna be honest... my work is my love. Okay, well... There was Harley, a sculptor I met in art school. But that didn't work out. And then there was Billy. Well, actually, there were two Billys, but I didn't really love them. Look, I guess I'm just old school. I have a different view of what love actually is. You know how I'm about nature and weather patterns and what each day brings to Yosemite? I do now. Well, for me it's all about the land and the details within it. And if I ever do fall in love, it'll be because of the little things. Do her eyes sparkle when she laughs, and does her smile touch my soul? What sounds does she make when she's sleeping? And how does she react to a sunrise over a mountain ridge, or when the Alpine glow washes over the face of Half Dome? What brings her joy, you know, and how does she accept sadness? And what does she see that I don't see? When I wake up next to her in the morning, am I excited to share a new day with her? And is there this unspoken look between us that says, "Yes, the world is a better place because we're in it together." It'll be like that, you know. The details. I guess you never really thought of it. Look. The Alpine glow. It's beautiful. Exactly perfect. Look. I have an idea if you're up for it. Try me. There's this great little country dive bar not too far from here. Food's pretty good and there's live music tonight. I'm in. So, are you getting what you need? I have a ton of beauty shots and a lot of stories, but... I still need that one photo that takes it to another level. Hmm. We're still on art patrol. Something like that. Mm.

Have you found the structure yet? I mean, the shots look great, but where's the book heading? I'm not sure. I'm adding a conservation angle with Jack and I'm building an emotional arc about the people I've met. - I still need that one photo. - To show off the park. To show that I'm an artist, not just another photographer. What about the park and what it means? Don't worry, it's all about the park. I just want an image that soars. Sounds good. How's Jack working out? Better than I could have imagined. He just have all this insight about the land. In fact, I have asked him to co-write the book with me. - Really? - Yeah. I think he's perfect. Keep those photos comin'. I will. Bye. Yes. Back when I was rock climbing, I used to come down here to swim, just to cool off. Have you always lived up here near the park? I've been coming up here since I was a kid. My father taught biology at Cal State Sacramento. We spent our summers here camping and hiking. I caught the climbing bug. Your parents let you? Not at first. I majored in Natural Science at Berkeley, but my father always complained I was majoring in climbing. Sounds like you were. Well, I climbed my way through graduate school. That's when I became interested in conservation. And started writing about it. Writing was like climbing. Put one step in front of another and then another, and pretty soon I had a best-selling book. That's how you got your mountain cabin. Somethin' like that. Let's talk about you, though, and what you're missing, that photo. What about that shot of the rainbow at the falls? I love it, but... Mm, doesn't define you as an artist. I need a photo of Half Dome, one that no one has ever gotten before. I am really stuck on this one. What if we backpack towards Half Dome? Let's do it. All right. Let's check in with Kos. We need some gear and he may have an idea or two. - Okay. - All right. I saw this photo of Half Dome in your book. It's a beauty. I got lucky one day. It's nice but there's a million just like it. I think it's a masterpiece. Think of all the times you've seen Half Dome. Do you ever see anything new? I always look for the face. The face? A legend has been passed down about a woman named Tis-sa-ack who quarreled with her husband. She was very upset, so she ran off to the east and formed a huge mountain. But her tears of guilt forever stained her face. You see what happens if you... Don't go there, Jack. I'm just saying. Later, her name got changed to Half Dome. And from a certain angle, you can see her face and the tear stains. But getting that photo, well, I don't know. That's it. That's the photo I need to get of her face. The problem is, Half Dome faces west. Most photos are taken from the south, from the John Muir Trail, - right? - That's right. That's where Jack took his photo. From Nevada Falls. Long ago, my grandfather helped John Muir create a different trail all the way to Half Dome. - From the west? - Right. But that trail was closed. Yeah, the Park Service closed that trail several years ago because of a big accident. So, that's it, there's no way for me to take the photo - of her face from the west? - Not safely. What's that saying, "the better part of valor"? So, I guess that's that. 'Fraid so. The idea hit me early this morning. He called and said the look on your face yesterday hurt his heart. Kos. Thanks. So what's the idea? When I was a boy, my grandfather took me camping way up Tenaya Creek. That's when he told me about the old trail. - The one that's closed? - Past that one. It's a long hike, but we kept going, above the creek, up a little ridge, and there it was. The face of Half Dome. - Close? - Close enough to see her tears. How was it? Was it steep? Not too bad. Jack, what do you say? Can we get a wilderness permit to camp up there? There's campsites along Tenaya Creek. - There you go. - Awesome. Thank you so much. All three of you. Well, time's a-tickin'. Let's pack up and hit the trail. - Bye. - See ya. Bye. Be safe. Good luck. What a great view. See that canyon over there? Uh-huh. That's Tenaya Creek. That's where we're headed. All right. Come on, roadrunner, let's get to it. This looks like our spot right here. Oh. Is this where we're camping? Yes, ma'am. All right. How far is the photo ridge from here, the one that Kos was talking about? Well, I'm guessing that we take the trail up as far as we can and then, if we're lucky, we'll find it. I'm feelin' lucky. Come on, let's find a spot to pitch our tents. Okay. Whatever it is you've made, it smells delicious. Pre-cooked chicken alfredo. My fave. The thermos right there has got some Chardonnay in it. Would you care to pour us a couple of glasses? What do you think of our dining room? Perfect. - Bon appétit. - Bon appétit. And Jack, thanks. Mm, not bad. Did I mention I was serving? You've come to the right restaurant. I heard the chef is amazing. So, tomorrow morning we're gonna find the face of a young girl stained with tears, the Holy Grail of photos. Do you think Kos will put my photo in his shop? Absolutely. So, I was thinking, my book is gonna tell the story of Half Dome. But I also want to tell your story. No, I don't think so. I mean, I can't stop thinking about you. Your story is amazing. And you've been coming here as a boy and becoming a climber and a conservationist. There's a romance to who you are. Well, I have to admit, I've been thinkin' about you too. - You have? - Yeah. Like what? How do you feel about lemon cookies? I thought you'd never ask. See this band of stars right here? - Uh-huh. - That's the Milky Way. Oh, and these three stars in a row right here, - you see 'em? - Yeah. That's Orion's belt. - Is that the Big Dipper? - Uh-huh. And that's Cassiopeia just below it. - A shooting star! - Yeah. Jack. Huh? I love this. Me too. I wish I could preserve this moment forever. So, what's next? I mean, after the face of tears. Tomorrow's my last night. Back to Chicago. I've done so much this week. Thanks to you. Went by too fast. Do you think we'll mesh? No. But complement, yeah. There is something else. There is? It's just... the other night when we were dancing... I looked into your eyes and it was like looking into your soul. Never had that feeling before. Like knowing if we're together... the world is a better place? Yeah, like that. Like that. We should probably get some sleep. - Big day tomorrow. - Yeah. Good idea. - Jack. - I hear 'em. What should we do? - Let 'em howl. - Jack! Scram! Get out of here! Get, get! You know, they live here, we don't. Do you think they would hurt us? No. Just hungry. Probably smelled our food. - Thanks. - Yeah. Back to bed? - You okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. - Good. - It's just coyotes, right? Right. I mean, nothing to worry about. Nothing to worry about. Okay, good, well, I'll just, uh... snuggle back into my bag. - Okay. - Okay. - Jack. - Yeah? Are you gonna be okay? Yeah, I'll be fine. Okay. Good. - Zoe. - Yeah? Goodnight. Goodnight. Good morning. Mornin'. - How'd you sleep? - I kept hearing coyotes. - I was lights out. - Hm. You made bacon and eggs? How are you not married? - Grab a seat. - Thanks. Ooh, this muffin looks good. If only I could find some coffee. Well, ask and you shall receive. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Cheers. - Cheers. Whew, that's strong. Mm. Shall we dig in? Let's do it. We'll grab our stuff on the way back. Okay, thanks. Yeah. All of this, this beautiful canyon. It's life-affirming. You just paraphrased my favorite John Muir quote. Yeah? What's his version? "Never again will one faint by the wayside" who gains the blessing of one mountain day. Whatever his fate, long life, short life, "stormy or calm, he is forever rich." What a writer. I got goosebumps. John Muir lives. I think you're gonna like this. Jack! Wow. Worth the walk? More like "Full Dome" than Half Dome. This is it. This is the shot that you've been waiting for. It's so immense. One of the largest rocks in the world. Look at her face and her tears. Yeah. What's wrong? See how Half Dome bends outward toward the left near the tears? Yeah? That's the shot. That's it. It's perfect. Great shot. Thanks. Kos was right. It was worth the effort. It's quite a shot. I'm absolutely wiped out. You know, if you're not feeling up to it tonight, - I totally get it. - It's our last night! - No, I just... - A hot bath and a quick nap's all I need. I'll see you on the patio at seven? Perfect. - Bye. - See ya. - You look amazing. - Thank you. You clean up very well. This is really nice. So, before I forget, what's the deadline? Uh... photographs by the end of the week. And the essays? I hope you're a fast writer. Get me some photos, I'll start hammering. Okay, I'll send some tonight and an outline of what I need. I really wish you weren't leaving. Yeah. I feel like we just got started. You think this will beat the Chardonnay in a thermos? Oh, nothing will ever beat that. But it will come close. To Zoe's Best. It's been magical. You really nailed that photo of Yosemite Falls. Our first day. How's that Half Dome shot? It's so beautiful. Oh, and Harris loved what you wrote for the introduction. "This valley, caretaken by our Native brothers and sisters" for thousands of years, now preserved forever and for everyone "as a magnificent national park." And the teaser you wrote about nature on the move and El Capitan, the Pillar of Power, I love it. Great. I mean, this is great. So, you like my first three essays then? I loved your intro... but your essays... there's just so much science. It's a coffee table book, not a text book. I'm a scientist. I mean, we agreed that I would write the way that I write. I know. I kn... I know. I'm sorry. I can't use your essays. They just don't fit. I'm really sorry. No, I mean, I get it. You're the book boss, right? Look, uh... - I'll talk to you later. - Jack. - Jack. - Hey, Zoe. I'm so glad you called. Yeah, I am sorry, I've just been... Oh, no, no, no, it's okay. I'm just happy to hear your voice. I'm really sorry that my essays didn't work out, but I'm sure you can finish this on your own. Oh, but Jack, I... I was thinking... No. Zoe, I'm done, uh... I'm sorry I couldn't help. But, Jack... you did help. You're on every page of this book, every photo, and I... I'm sure it's gonna be great, and I've loved spending time with you, but we're in different worlds, Zoe. It's time for us to move on. Goodbye. Bye. I know, Harris, but I need more time. I'm glad that you like the photos, but they're not gonna make any sense without the narrative. What happened to Jack? We had creative differences. I see. Okay, okay. Look, I'm sorry, but... I can only give you two more days. That's it. I understand. Thanks, Harris. - Hello. - Jack. Uh, what a surprise. - Um, come on in. - Thanks. You sounded a little stuck. And that bear keeps staring at me. Well, I did some rewriting, simplified some things. There were sections of your essays I loved. We got work to do. Do you have a printer? That's it. Finished. I couldn't have done it without you. You're the one that made it great. Oh, so now you like armchair adventure books. I liked the adventure of making this one. To our adventure. Zoe's Best of the West. Yosemite. Well... I gotta catch a flight. Back to the mountains? Yeah. Who am I kidding? I... I came back here because I'm in love with you. I'm in love with you too. Whatever happens for the rest of my life, I want it to be with you. Me too. Forever. Forever. So, your book did well. Very. What's next? Have you ever been to the Grand Canyon? Your next book. Our next book. Harris sent me off with a contract. The Grand Canyon. And I also have another question for you. As a journalist? As the woman who's in love with you. Okay. Will you marry me? Are you always this forward? Only with you. Yes, I will marry you in front of these mountains and Yosemite Falls. Do you, Zoe Best, take Jack Hawkins to be your lawful wedded husband, to love, honor, and cherish from this day forward? I do. And do you, Jack Hawkins, take Zoe Best to be your lawful wedded wife, to love, honor, and cherish from this day forward? I do. I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may now kiss the bride.
