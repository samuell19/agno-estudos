Hold that! - In my neighborhood. - Are you lying? I heard the revving! Are you at the mechanic's? Lying to me! Hit your head! - I did... - How dare you lie to me? - I'll come there! - Sure, try me. I really am coming tonight. I'll see you at the bus stand then. - Start the bike. - Won't you ask why I'm coming? I'll take my leave, sir. Inform kitty whatever it is. - Careful kids! - See you, sir! - Win it! I've seen girls fall for guys, but check this out! Her father must be a pauper! You wouldn't let me take an auto, at least go faster! I'm embarrased! Stop nudging! I've made sure you get shade! What's free babe? - Which one is free? - Everyone's overtaking us! - There's space! Go faster! - Shut up! I am going fast. You might as well turn off the engine at this speed. - At least someone will tow us back home. - Turn your engine off! Shall I tow you back home? Dingleberry! What? Hey! Dingleberry? Look at that! - Hey, stop the bike! - What is it? - It'll take that guy a week. Our friends are waiting! - She's giving me looks! Piece of cake! Awesome, man! That's how you do it! You think you're big now? Racing with this piece of crap? It doesn't matter which bike you race with in traffic. The difference is the rider. It comes down to who can take those tiny gaps. Am I right? Greetings! - Welcome, sir! - Greetings! - Are you the one who's racing? - No, it's Karthi. Yes sir. - The opponent? - This guy. Greetings, sir! Madhan with the RX 100. Karthik with the Duke 200. We're racing from Ashok Pillar to Tirusulam in traffic. The winner gets to do whatever with the loser's bike. We're bound by this agreement in Sir Java Thangavel's presence. - They're here! Quick! - Get him Karthi! Hey! Damn it! Hey! - Look, Madhan is here! - Let's go! Kasi Theatre walkie to Control. Hello. Hello. Alandur Signal. Two rash drivers. Black Yamaha and an orange Duke. I'll take care. - What is this? - Manohar! - Sir? Two guys are racing... - Stop them. - Okay, sir. Show that... Hey! Stop! I said stop! - Think you can race? Manohar! - Move it! Shankar! Automate the signal and take him to the hospital! You! Who is it? Who's there? Damn you! Stop right there! Stop! I said stop! Saidapet calling Control Room. Send a Patrol vehicle immediately to 3rd Street outside Mount Station. Come out. - Sir... - Come out I said! - Come! - Let me go, sir... Trying to escape? Sir! Let me go, I'll come... Sir... Let me go, please sir... - Sir... - Let's go. Sir? How can I come like this? It'll be embarrassing in the streets. At least get me that pant, sir. Please, sir... Sir? Sir, please sir, not that... Don't, sir. Please... Anything except that... Please, sir... Look at that! He looks good in the nightie isn't it? You, whose chain did you snatch? I'm talking to you! Sir, I was just in a bike race. Aren't you racing just to snatch chains? - Welcome, lady cops. - Greetings, sir. Stripping them to their briefs is fine, what's this? - It's Traffic SI Rajasekhar's case. - How come we never find such nighties? - What brand is it? - Why don't you ask him? - Let's go in and discuss. - Okay, sir. Hey... Madhan! - Madhan! - Sir, we have 2 grand... Step aside! He's injured a Traffic constable. - Sir, did I do that? - Hey! Just wait. Our team has gone to nab your opponent. Stop with your yapping. Make sure the Inspector doesn't file a case. You, get going. Get us 10 grand. - Sir, take this... - Keep it with yourself. Have you seen your faces? What are you looking at? Sir, I hope you didn't file a case against them. We were the winners. Drop by in the morning. There's 10 grand in this. Here, eat up. Racer... It doesn't matter if you're in your briefs or a nightie. Don't skip food. Eat up! Greetings, sir! What's the matter? The Crime Sub-Inspector is on leave. I'm in-charge. What? What are you staring at? You guys will race and pay a fine with concession citing under-age, and we're supposed to do nothing? I've uploaded your procession on YouTube. Take a look. This is the punishment for all you illegal racers. It'll remain until you die. It'll remain even after your death. Are you disrespecting Sir? How dare you? You have the guts to disrespect cops? We should thrash you! You think you're big? I've been watching you all day! How disrespectful! - Here Madhan, wear the tee. - It's fine. Where are you taking the bike? We won the race. The bike is ours. Get your hands off. You do remember the bet, don't you? Listen up. All relatives and the owner of the bike... Whoever loaned the bike, and tuned the bike... Take one last look at the bike. I'm about to burn it. Come here, loser. The honor is yours. - Shall we burn it? - Do it! Here... Get your hands off. I'll thrash you if you drum on it. - Tea! - Here... - Two teas! Take the tea. Hey, it's your Aunt. My aunt? Since your phone was confiscated by the cops she's been calling me. I didn't pick up fearing she'll find out that you were racing. Shit, that's right. She told me she was coming from Hosur. Ask her what it is. Talk to her. Hello... - Aunty! I'm here! - Where were you all night? Come inside first! - What's happening? - I'll tell you. - This is my eldest daughter-in-law. - Is it so? - Yes. This is Rajalakshmi's only brother, Madhan. It's his close friend's brother's wedding today. He's been helping them with the wedding. - That's why he's late. - Is it? - Yes. Come, sit down. I'm good. - Look it's Sebastian sir. - Greetings, welcome... Where's Kitty? Tell me! - Go on. - Where? - She's over there. Come here. That's my younger brother. Is it? Raji, I really like you. Tell me if you like me. Well... Kitty must not like him! Uh... Kitty must not like him! - Kitty must not like him! - Tell me if you like me... I feel a little anxious since he's a cop... - Kitty must not like him! - But... - I don't want to miss him. - Kitty must not like him! - Tell him you don't like him! - Raji? Tell him you don't like him! I like you! Son? Are you guys done yet? You guys took your time in a restaurant. Imagine if this was at home! Raji? If you don't mind, can we take a selfie? Brother... You like the girl right? We went because she was beautiful in the photos. But she looks better in person. Let's visit their house next Sunday. But... The girl's brother... There's something wrong with him. Isn't it? - You're right. - Am I going to marry him? What's with the humor? Brothers-in-law are a boon. Look at my brothers-in-law. - They dance to my tunes. - Shut up! But there's something wrong with that guy. Raj... You think he would have been at the marriage hall last night? - Something fishy... - Increase the volume. It's a nice song. Isn't it? Madhan will use his brother-in-law's influence to escape the traffic cops hereafter. That's true. I feel like they're a really nice family. If this alliance works out my brother and his wife - will let out a huge sigh of relief. - Don't worry. Everything will fall in place. Our thoughts aside, I wonder what those two are thinking. - They're all smiles. - Madhan... You like the groom right? I didn't feel like I was talking to a new person. I spoke to him just like I would to you. We have sought many alliances... But he's the only guy who didn't ask for my number. I really like that. He will get it from Aunt. He will? Will he, Madhan? He will. He will, right? Who are you, oh woman? You make me ache for you Unfulfilled desires you seem to instigate Lean on my shoulders I've fallen for you You tickle my senses away Those words that you uttered I like you. I'm keeping as a heartfelt memory Those words that you uttered, have now become by breath. O' little lovebird Nest in my heart What have you done to me? I'm aching within I don't need anyone but you by my side With you resting on my lap, even death is fearless. Your sister will understand if you don't like him. Tell her. How will he? You know what will happen if his sister finds out about the race. If that happens... I can never race. - What does your brother say? - He's fine with it. - Did he say anything about me? - Ask him yourself. - Here... - No way! - Talk to him. - You talk to him. He doesn't have his license yet, so he's freaking out. - that's all... - Did I say that? To hold your hand in mine I need you in my life Every moment that I don't see you My heart sheds tears of love I didn't foresee this with you Let's begin by holding hands I can feel your pulse in my fingers I'm not sure if I'm trembling or if it tickles I'll sweep you off your feet And keep you close to my heart I'll rest on your comforting shoulders. You are the source of my life! O' little lovebird. Nest in my heart. Madhan! Isn't the baby cute? What have you done to me? I'm aching within. I don't need anyone but you by my side With you resting on my lap, even death is fearless. What sort of a hairstyle is this? You look like a freak. - Stop it. You're just jealous. - Guys, hold it! Stop! - You! Stop! - Where do you stay? Listen, we're all drunk right now. What are you saying? - We don't understand... - We're drunk! Let's go. - Hey - Yes? Look at those drunkards driving like it's a test. - India's future! Stop them! - Stop right there! Pull over. - Bright future! - Pull over and get off the bike. Move it. Faster! Huh? Blow into it properly. - How can the readings be negative? - The straw is broken. You, blow at me! Wine? I used to drink it as a kid, silly. Step aside. You don't even know who you're blowing at. Blow at me. - What? - I said blow. - Don't you have Dengue? - Dengue? What are you saying? Constable... What's the matter? They're sloshed, but the meter readings are negative. How will it be positive? - Handle it. - Okay, sir. Sir, you need to handle this. - Where do you think you're going? - Get your hands off me! Off you go! Sir, you need to handle this. Check if I'm drunk. Check me... Check me, sir... I said check me! Are you visiting our house tomorrow? - Shankar... - Sir? These guys aren't drunk. Let them go. Yay! That's the way to do it! I told you that pill removes alcohol traces didn't I? We'll never get caught! What can you do? - We've taken the pill! - Sir? Are these pills for real? Get on with your work! Sorry, sir. What will you do? We'll never get caught! What can you do? We've taken the pill! Mom, hang up. I'll call back. We'll never get caught! What can you do? - Tell me kitty - The pill... What? - Over the phone? How? - What's he asking? - You're at home... - Is he talking to his sister? How can I? - I'm on duty. - Dude, what is this? - The noise? Some loafers are pretending to be drunk. Your brother isn't home? No wonder! Is that why you're dirty talking? Like the Hollywood scenes? Let's save that for after we get married. Madhan... I think Kitty has started boozing. Sorry Madhan... Madhu, please! I won't challenge you in business again. I won't stand in your way. This will be the last time. I won't cause any trouble whatsoever. Let me go Madhu, please! It will never happen again! Please let me go! I won't challenge you again. Please... - Challenge? - No - You're challenging me? The people who challenge me have never lived by their terms nor have they died by their terms. Pull over here. - Welcome, sir. Greetings! - Welcome, sir. We're Madhan's childhood friends. Look at what we've done for you. We got all these from Facebook. Do you like the pictures and the captions? Isn't the poster awesome? - Shall we go? - Sure. This way. Let's take the shortcut. Don't worry it's just my Grandpa's brief. Let's take the left. Sir, this is The Goddess! - Pray to her. - She's powerful I tell you. - Mom! - What is it? Our footwear is missing. - Yay! - Come on kids! The first job was a hit. The second job should be shit. Understood? Go on now. Careful sir, there's cow dung along the way. It's a good sign to lose your footwear while praying. They hogged and now they're letting loose. Have a lolipop sister! Move it Four Eyes! Who the hell are you in between? - I'll kill you first! - Prasad! Calm down bro, you're out on a week's bail. Take it easy. What's the rush? I'm letting him go for your sake! You! Stop! - I'll kill you! - Sir, this is common in this area. There was a murder this morning. Come, let's go home. Brother... Look here. It's very close by. Why didn't we come this way? We could have but I instructed them to give you a tour. It's not enough if you just take a look at the house. You need to know the neighborhood. That's why. Let's go. Come. - Greetings! How are you? - Welcome! Come inside. - Serve everyone. - When did you finish college? Take it. What the hell? Is this the time for this? - Get out I said! - It's the Corporation's orders. - Who are you? I said get out! - Hold on, I'm almost done. - Please sit. - No one's getting Dengue. How is it the girl's fault if the neighborhood is bad? Mom spoke to me. Their loo was very clean apparently. Even Pichu bro said... We have a maid to do those chores. Is that a place your kids need to visit in the future? So you declined the alliance? See... You've always had your way since childhood. You'd do anything to have your way. Look... Look at how many people we have employed here. Instead of choosing the Central Vigilance job in Delhi after your studies you're out here in the streets. The heat, the dust and the noise! Okay... I understand that you like this job. It only affects you. But the decision you take in marriage will even affect our little Neha at home. We'll look for someone better. Come on! You're almost there! He's lost it! Stop screaming guys. The owner might be here any minute. I will be in trouble. Get out! Are you showing off? Look, Madhan, it's your Dingleberry. Hello? Yes, Geetha, you know what? That was totally unexpected. And when I looked so... What a fall! Shit! Let's get inside! Damn it! Shit! Hello? Hello! Won't you tend to your customer? What do you want customer? How much does this cost? How much does this cost? Are you sure you want that one? Uh, yes? I'm sorry, but I saw you falling down. I can't control my laughter. Can I laugh just once? Please? Please, please? Fine, laugh! Hey, I'm sorry...Wait up! You enquired about the price but you aren't buying? Shall I convince the owner to offer you a 1+1? What? You can take it like the chairs you had the other day. Hey... It's me, Dingleberry. Dingleberry! Dingleberry? Oh! Yes! - Yes, that's me. - What's Dingleberry? Come on, I'll tell you. Bye. You, can't you pick up my calls? Scared to race? We won the race. You don't get to call the shots. If you're fearless, you'd come any moment. Look at the loser being righteous. Who lost? If it wasn't for that... The cop showed up. Keep your excuses to yourself. We don't race with guys who wear nighties. Everyone has an eye on your fashion. - Even I was turned on bro. - Take a look. Don't you look gorgeous in the nightie? Start the vehicle. Bloody loser! I didn't expect that it would turn out this beautiful. You like it, right? - Yes, I do. - Then I'm happy. The first gift is always special. Yes. Hey, Madhan. - Alright, I'll take my leave. - Okay. You could have said something... What happened? What's the problem? I don't like him. - You're telling me now? - I've told you now! I hate him! Why are you crying? Tell me Kitty. Kitty, why are you crying? Why is everyone crying? Aunty, why are you crying? Why do you think people cry? I'm crying with the thought of the pain she'll undergo every month. You're a boy. You'll remain in this house. But she'll leave this house soon. I'm crying because of that. Why must Kitty leave this house? Aren't we supposed to get her married? The guy who'll marry her, your brother-in-law must be a good man. The thought of that brings tears. Why should you cry over him? It's not in our hands whether a person will be good or not. It's not like a jackfruit whose quality you can check. It has to happen. - Look at the way he talks. - Stop fretting over it. This Lion will find a fine match for his sister. Won't you find you brother-in-law? I'm sure you'll find her a King. - Madhan is there. Call him. - We need to play well. Hey, brother-in-law! Keep the Wides at bay. What did you say? I said don't bowl Wides. Before that part. I didn't say anything. Alright let's field. Hey, brother-in-law! Madhan, don't! Madhan, don't do it! Stop! Madhan, don't! Madhan, stop, don't do it ! Let me go! Let go of me! I said let go! Brother, please stop! Please stop, it hurts! Please let me go! Please stop! Damn it! Kitty! Kitty! Madhan! Madhan! So what if he calls you brother-in-law? I'm not gonna marry him! Even the other day! You asked Vidya if her brother would marry me. Why are you like this? Who else will seek an alliance for you? What did Aunt say the other day? She was crying hoping you should get a good person as your groom. I'm supposed to look for that good person. Madhan... I need to study first. I need to work and... Just like aunt... I won't marry an alcoholic. - I'll marry only if I like... - You don't know anything! I'll look for the groom. I need to like him too. Okay. Look... If I like someone you need to like him too. Only then I'll marry him. Okay? Promise? Promise! What actually happened was... I was speeding the other day... You don't like him, right? Here. Go return it. Hold it. Return it. If you don't want him, neither do I. Go return it. Here. I'll delete his number right now. Alright? Hey! Are you nuts? Is this how you drive? Pull over. Stop talking and pay the fine. Don't you know the traffic rules? You crossed the stop-line after the red signal. You're a cop right? Don't you know the rules? You just came to visit our house. The alliance isn't agreed. Nothing is fixed. - And you're showing up with gifts? - Hey! - Who do you think you're talking to? - Shankar... This is a personal issue. There's nothing personal. What's personal between us? Huh? Let your sister say that. Here, talk to him. Talk to her. Raji? - Sorry... - Why? I didn't know that my brother didn't like this. This won't work out. - Forgive me. - Raji, listen to me. Hey, give me that! You were just an insect stuck on food. My sister got rid of you. If you come by the house, or make phone calls and send gifts again you'll be in trouble. Dude, get me that crap. Hey, brother-in-law! Bro, don't do it! Wait! Don't go! - Let go of me! - Listen to me bro! Don't go Madhan! Don't go Madhan! Sir, let us handle this guy. Carry on with your duty. - He's my brother-in-law. - Nonsense! Who is your brother-in-law? I'll decide whose brother-in-law I'll be. Listen carefully. This very moment, I've decided. You are my brother-in-law. Dear brother-in-law! Inform your sister about this. What has gotten into you? Weren't you both romancing on the phone? Tell her it's because he's a cop. No, he's a cop... - so I feel scared. - Scared of what? He's not selling weed. - Weed? - Weren't you both singing on the phone? Tell her he's collecting bribes. - Tell her. - Shut up! I mean, he might be called for duty at any moment. You can't tell when he'll be home. Didn't you already know that? Someone has changed your mind. Where's that sly fellow? - Tell her I'm not here. - Talk to her. Talk to her! You heard Kitty. - We'll look for another alliance. - What? Another alliance? Let me talk to her. Hi aunty, it's me Nosy. - Tell me. - Yesterday the traffic cop stopped me. - So? - I bribed him just 10 bucks. I don't think that family will suit us. And you think you know about families? Your father took money from both political parties to cast a vote. - How did she find out? - And don't even get me started with your mom. - Don't you utter a word about their family. - I'm out of this! Madhan! Do you both think this is a joke? I've promised to get back to them with good news. Whatever it is, let me come there first. What does that mean? There's only 13 days left before Aunt gets back. We have to find a good alliance before that. Is that possible? Why not? There's heavy traffic between Sivaji Junction and Senmozhi Park. We finished our race in 3.5 minutes. Finding a groom in 13 days shouldn't be an issue. We'll find him and we'll get your sister married. One moment please. Who's available in customer support? 3 months package. O wily one! 3 months? O wily one! Yes, the Classic Package... O crafty one! - We have to find a nice groom. - In 13 days. She's going through them woes! No way! He looks better. O rosy one! Made of gold! Nah! She snapped, like the kite's thread! With a lion's roar, he challenged! He's causing her them woes! A witty, naive man He wants to find for a groom! With no mercy, he troubles her! Despite all the options he won't budge! This guy will be fine, right? A glorius combo he asks He's alright. Of Ranbir and Ranvir! Is his sister Deepika Padukone? He's very strict. He works as a Physical Trainer at a school. Too short? Look straight. Step on it. Seems a little overweight. Open your mouth. What are you looking at? Get out! She's not a cow! If the guy's slick, he thinks it's ego! What can I say, O Lord! If the guy's shy, he says he's naive! Thanks! I can't stand this! There's only 6 days left. Will we find him? O his mischief! You keep finding faults with everyone! She's losing it! It's not like your sister is perfect. Someone show up What's wrong with my sister? and cure his madness! Even if there's something wrong, the groom needs to be flawless. His sister's love is her curse! He's pushed her to the edge! In that case, let me go. No words can explain! Get lost! O wily one! Sorry. O crafty one! She's going through them woes! - Are you a kid? - He's still a kid. How is this girl? O rosy one! We'll talk to their parents? Made of gold! Someone is speaking in English. She snapped like the kite's thread! - Can you speak to them? - I'll talk to them. Hi, Raji! Why are you calling our neighbors? Are you a cop or a criminal? That's how I'll behave. Oh, really? Okay. Hello, sir. Sit down. - My name's Rajasekar. I watch all your shows. - Please. If you don't mind, can I take a selfie? Happy married life! - Sir, please... - I'm not your guy! No matter what he does You cannot hate him! Even with his twisted questions He makes her insides go crazy! Something clueless binds them together! Their naive hearts can't stop fighting it! To win his heart! The witty one has fallen! It's like the cat and mouse! This game of hearts! O wily one! O crafty one! She's going through them woes! O rosy one! Made of gold! She comes out twisted and turned! She's got him with her wits and he's got her with chivalry. It's all-night WhatsApp trouble! She blazes silently He got caught in the fire! It's on all day, endlessly! He's the crazy one! He never gives up! - Do you like him? - Yeah. He's got the variety to win her heart! - Okay! - They're about to leave. - Shankar! He's the smart one! He's filled her heart! Stop the Black Dio. Go. He searched for a 'he' but found a 'she'. Where do you work? Brother... My friend is really scared. You beat him in the race. He wants to know if we can change the bet. I'll give you cash brother. We have five thousand bucks. - Come here, sit down! - Please let me go! What was the bet? - I should kiss the silencer if I lose. - So kiss it! How dare you show up in our streets? - What do you guys want? - Why are you showing off to these kids? I've been asking to race for a while now. - I can't race you. - It's fine if you don't have the guts. What about all of you? How about a written agreement conceding loss? - Hey! - Hold it! Fine, I'll race you. But in a one-way road. Are you up for it? Why one-way? Let's go no-brake. - When? - Anytime! - How about now? - Get the bike! - Stop it Madhan! - Why? - Hold it right there! - Come here... - Why? - Just come. - Let me go! - Are you insane? We've just fixed an alliance for your sister. Let her get married first. We can race them later. How are they related? Listen, we lost the previous race. We will challenge you anytime! This time we'll decide when the race will happen. Let's go. - Sit. - Look at the losers running away. What are these two covers? This is ours. That's yours. I informed Ravi sir that we've fixed your alliance. And guess what? He sent us a sample invite and has asked you to choose. Kitty, check them out. Madhan! - What happened? - Madhan! Madhan! Hey! Run Kitty Run! - Hello? - Sister, are you free now? Why? Hi, sister! - Sit down. - Why are we here? You could have just come home. I wanted to talk to you alone. I would have shown your brother about 1101 profiles. Yesterday when you said you liked that guy - Okay? - Okay. I didn't feel like you meant it. It's my job to understand your expectation. Why are we discussing this? We still have time. Let's look for another guy. Why choose someone you don't like? There's still 3 days for your Aunt to return. Were you okay with any other alliance? No... I've left that in the past. Forget the guy. Just tell me why you liked him. Rajasekar Hello! Can I ask you something? Why are you getting married? Umm... We can't live alone forever, right? That's why. What about you? I have two reasons. One... Every body has needs. Hello? Won't you ask me what the second reason is? Tell me... As a cop... I'm forced to interact with criminals and their crimes. Within the department and otherwise. I'm not able to be honest with anyone. I can't confess at a temple of God, because I'm not a believer. So... With at least one person in the world I'd like be to utterly honest. That's why I'm getting married. Wow, that's amazing. Why did you let go of him then? That... My family must like him, right? Yeah, right. As if you have a huge family. Even now you won't accept that your brother doesn't like him. But what you did was stupid. Nonsense! Sorry, sister. I'm sorry. Can I say something? Your brother loves me a lot! I like him too. He never told me! We still haven't told each other. Forget that. Try telling him that you don't like me. Will he let go of me? Do you think he will? Sister... When he's older and he realizes his mistake all he can say is 'Sorry'. But what you lose is your life. Just because someone guides us it doesn't mean they can decide where we go. Last morning I met Traffic Sergeant Rajasekar. He told me about his love. He also told me about your love. One week... You guys lived together over the phone, right? Sister... Try talking to him just once more, please! No... I... I don't have anything else to tell him. You can decide after you talk to him. Sir? Don't worry, I'll convince Madhan. Okay? All the best. Bye. Why is your phone turned off? You? How are you here? I called your office and they told me you were here. - Anyway, buy me something. - I can't! I didn't bring my card along. You didn't bring your card? Damn! I don't have cash either. Anyway, I'll take a leak. I need to talk to you right here. Don't go inside. Why not? I have to go! It's urgent! Hey! Wait! I can control my anger, but not this. I'm sure you can control this, but you can't control your anger. Are you out of your mind? Why did you do that? - I'm sorry. - Who asked you to come here? I asked her to come here. Kavin helped me. Kitty, let's leave. Raji, I need to talk to you. You've deleted his number from your phone. Let's leave. So what if she deleted my number? Didn't you ask me to return his gifts? Kitty, let's leave. She must have refused me because you. She could not have said she didn't like me. Kitty, do you like him? You promised that you will marry someone only if I like him as well. If I like someone you need to like him too. Only then I'll marry him. Why are you silent? - Promise? - Promise. I did! But that was when you were nine and you were crying. Why do you keep holding on to that? Can't someone change their mind? Won't you grow up? We're the same blood until we die! Even if you die, you'll still be my sister. But the promise you made changes with new people? Changes with time? Kitty... Whatever it is, let's go home and talk, Kitty. Let's go, Kitty... Raji, make your own choice this time. Blood... Not over there. A glass must have pierced you. No, it's alright. I'm very sorry. I'm extremely sorry. Go with him already! What the hell did you just say? - Don't hit him! - What did you just say? - Sister, let him go. - What did you say to me? - Madhan! - Will you say that again? - Where did that come from? - Sister, let go of him. - Tell me! - Sister, please. Sister, please... Sister, please... Don't cry. Raji, please don't cry. At least you tell me! What is it with you two? Did you race? Did you? Yes, I did. But do you know what he did? He took a bribe from the opponent and let them go. But me... A pant was available. He deliberately made me wear a nightie and insulted me. He wanted to insult me in front of the public, so he made me wear it and arrested me. That didn't satisy him! He uploaded it on YouTube as well. It'll be on the internet even if I die. Kitty... Please come home with me. Alright... I'll stop racing. Come home with me. You don't need him. Let's go home Kitty. Come on, Kitty... - Yay! - Put me down... Hey there, loser. Get off the bike. Hey, listen carefully. There are no doubts on who your brother-in-law is. Until the end of the world I'm your sister's husband and you are my brother-in-law. Let go of me! Please don't hit me! Please stop! It hurts! Please don't beat me! Kitty... Kitty... Kitty... Congratulations brother-in-law! Kitty... Raji After you put up your honeymoon photos the room looks great, right? Thanks aunty. What's with the formality? And what's that? Let me see. This is my brother and I. Oh. He's your only brother, right? You must have been like a mother to him. But I wasn't a mother. I couldn't be one. I couldn't. I became a lover. I had to become a wife. I couldn't be a mother forever. Only mothers can do that. I feel sad for my brother. His trust would have been shattered. Let that go. Listen, Raji... More than a sister and brother's bond bonds between brothers-in-law are stronger. I'm not saying this to please you. People who are good friends when they become closer they treat each other like brothers-in-law. That very bond will reunite you with your brother. Hey! How was the blend? Hey, move it! What happened child? Her water bottle is with him. Let me go! Brother... Give me a cigarette. - You smoke? - I'm starting today. You, hit him! I said thrash him! Harder! Keep at it! Come on! - Come on, you! - Brother... Come! Come on! Thrash him! Come on, hit him! Come on! Thrash him! Hey, what the...? Why is the damn bike here? What? How dare you? Who is this guy now? Thrash him first! Tea... Do you have butter biscuits? Stop the vehicle! Hey! Stop right there! If I catch you! Where do you think you're going? This way. Stop running! You've been like this for a few days. Did you do something wrong? I did something good. But some people... Look... If you want to change everyone nothing good will come of it. Just let it go and move on. Remove your shirt. - Sir, here's my license and papers. - I said remove your shirt! - Sir... - Leave. This is my original license. Just don't kill anyone. That'll do. Leave. Move it. Come on! Move it! Get going! Come on! Shall we go to Pondicherry this week? As if you'll take me. This time we're going for sure! Yes sir, it's the Traffic Sub-Inspector. Sir? Where are you coming from? Mogappair, sir. Where to? Pallavaram. Tell me the Hospital's name quickly. Hospital... Open it. Sir... There's a cancer patient inside. So what, it's not locked is it? Move it! Sir... Sir... Open it. Sir? What's the problem in opening it? Open it! Will you open it or shall I? Open it! Who are you? Huh? Customs? Are you from the Crime Department? Check if the vehicle's papers are fine. Not what's inside. We stop the common people and pave way for ambulances. Logically, we have the right to know what's inside. Also If there's a crime, any of the 20,000 police officers in the city can intervene. But no one's intervening. No one except you. These 20,000 police officers are just for you. One Commissioner 4 Additional Commissioners 8 Joint-Commissioners 12 Deputy Commissioners These are the only police I know. I talk to them as I sit cross-legged. And you? Stay at your level. Hey! Take a good look. It's filled with drugs. I mix drugs in Ghutka and Pan Masala and sell it. There's no cancer patient inside. Only cancer. Do what you can. - Hey - Sir? The next time someone stops our vehicle what you do when a dog comes in between do the same and get going. Why are you making up stories? Did someone steal your girlfriend? I can't race whenever you call me. - You guys lost, right? - So? - So wait. - So many vehicles in the way! - Bro, do you remember the traffic cop in Saidapet? - Yes? He shunned him and married his sister bro. We call the cops brothers-in-law just for fun bro. But he really is his brother-in-law. - Shut up with the big talk loser! - Madhan! What's that noise over there? The shop is open but you're here... - I thought I heard you guys fighting, but you're playing? - Aunty! - When did you come? - There are so many of you! Let me bring tea for everyone. Children... When does Madhan have to come for the race? - Hello? - Tell me, Raji. Aunty? Why did you leave so early? That's no biggie. Well... Shall I tell her? That you were about to race with your peers? - Shall I? - Hello? - Shall I tell her? - Aunty? Tell her. Why? - Hello? - To spoil her peace? Aunty? Can you hear me? It's nothing... Jaya called me and said her kid is unwell. - Damn. - I spoke to her. Nothing to fear. Madhan is with me. Really? Aunty What is he doing? He's sleeping. He's sleeping? Aunty Place the phone on his ear. Uh... Do it! It's Raji! - Hello? Madhan? - Talk to her! Talk to her! - Hello? - Talk to her! - Damn it! - Oh God! Hey! Stop the bus! Hey! Get up! Hey, stop the bus! Something has gotten into him. He just threw it! Check every seat! Sir, he's here! - Why are you taking me? - Get up! Sir, tell me what it is! Oh God! Madhan! - Move it! - Sir, why are you taking me? - Stay quiet. - I need to know, sir. - Just get inside. - Sir, why are you taking him? - Why are you taking me? - I said get inside. Sir? - Sir, tell me... - Why are you taking him, sir? - Go away! - Sir, why? - Go away! - Sir, what did he do? Visit the police station and find out. Stop following us. Leave. Go away! - Tell us the truth! - Sir, we don't know anything! Sir, it hurts! - Are you going to confess or not? - Sir, it wasn't us! If they imprison you, you can't get out for 3 years. - Speak up! - Sir, it wasn't our fault! Everyone's been fed well by your mothers! Sir, Greetings! Sir, don't beat us! Rascals! You have five minutes to speak up! Greetings, sir. I'm the Traffic Sub-Inspector for Saidapet. I know, Rajasekar. Sit down. You've come here in person. What is it? You arrested someone on the Hosur bus. He's my... Wife's brother. What's the complaint? I'll tell you. What do you mean wife's brother? You could have said he's your brother-in-law. Hey, which one of you is his brother in law? I'm talking to you! - It's him. - Doesn't he have a mouth? Sir, he's the main culprit. They've stolen jewels from the Judge's wife. The bike used for the theft belongs to your brother-in-law. But he says they park the race-bikes in a garage. And that someone must have stolen it. There's a lot of pressure. Either you talk to them and make them confess or I'll file an FIR against them all and produce them in Court. You take care of it from there. Your phone's ringing. Attend it. What happened? I just reached. I have to check what the issue is. He's very young. Raji don't cry, please. Did they beat him up? They won't imprison him, right? I said I'll take care of it. Please babe. Get him out of there somehow, please. Okay, I'll call you back. Sorry. Is there no other way? You're newly-wed, right? I understand. Everyone respects you. It's no mean feat to be selected by Central Vigilance at such a young age. Dhanapal! - Sir? - Check what that noise is about. Come with me. People don't help each other within the Department. I don't know why. I'll handle this case differently. Do as I say. At your own risk take your brother-in-law and keep him in your house under your custody. He must be available for enquiry at all times. I don't trust him. I trust you. Write it down and take him, Rajasekar. Sir, we loathe each other. How can I take him home? It's not possible. I'm leaving. Thanks. Constable, prepare the FIR for these boys. Sir... Sir... Sir, we're Madhan's friends' parents. Our children are irresponsible. They drive fast. But they're not thieves. As soon as you arrived, we thought they will be set free. But even you are leaving in anger. My wife needs a C-section. As I was returning after taking a loan from the pawn shop they nabbed me. Look, Madhan. If the cops find out they will take all of it. If your child is sad it's the end. If he doesn't eat for a week you can't handle it. How long will he stay hungry? You don't have to buy them an expensive bike to calm them down. They'll end up racing and this is how it'll end. Do any of these kids have a license? Sir... We made a mistake. Forgive us this time. Even if we have to break their bones we'll make sure they don't race again. If you stay at your sister's place for a while, we can all get out of this. Madhan, I have an exam from tomorrow. My life... You have left me My heart... You've cut me into pieces Come in... My life... He's gonna stay here for a few days. You have left me My heart... You've cut me into pieces The pain that you've given me The anger that you displayed - Who's this? - My brother. Still lurks within The love I gave you The care I showed you Do you still feel it? One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! My life... You have left me My heart... You've cut me into pieces Like an island that's abandoned Come and eat, Madhan. My life has become... Identify the culprit. I placed my trust My child is born. In a flower with no roots - Not curious? - Very important! And came crashing down. Even if its feathers happen to fall The birds won't look for them Despite falling off the feathers never forget the birds. Sir, my bike was stolen. The Police recovered it from this street. If we check your CCTV footage, we can find out who the culprit is. Help me sir, please. Brother... That one? That's not even a camera. It's a dummy. - It's just to scare thieves. - Okay. Why haven't the memories faded? Why don't I feel like crying? I'm like the shards of a broken mirror Go away. I'll become a lonely tree. Go away. Who else do I have? Go away. I don't need anyone else. Sweetheart! For the happiness you've given me I don't know what to give you! Why don't you tell me, please? We can't help you with everything. It's exciting for women to wonder what their husbands will gift them. Think about it. One day, the lights in this police-brain will turn green. My life... Talk to him. You have left me He doesn't come out. Go. My heart, you've cut me into pieces. The pain that you've given me Talk to me. The anger that you displayed Madhan, I'm a sister too. Still lurks in me Don't play 'hard to get'. I have a brother too. It's not enough if he's just your brother. He must have been a father to his sister. The love I gave you and the care I showed you Do you still feel it? My life... My heart... Give me two. Thanks. My life... Eat up! - For me? - Hold on, I'm getting it. Here. - You've paid for two. - I don't want it now. - Brother... - I don't want it. - What happened? - Go away! - Mom, it's Raji. - Give it. Talk to her. - Talk to her! - Why me? You talk to her. I can't hear her speak. The deal was that I'll tell your family, which I did. Now you tell my family. - Tell them! - Do you want that baby? Dad will buy that for you. - Hello? - Raji, are you fine? Hi Aunty, it's not Raji. - It's Rajasekhar. - Son, how are you? Tell me... The thing is... Raji... - She's been two months... - Tell her! Raji is two months... she's been carrying... - a baby... - Son! Thanks! Thank you very much! Thanks? Why is she thanking me? - Raji's pregnant! - Mom! - Then you should say 'Congratulations'. - Okay. Son, you've completed a humongous job! I mean, you did it... I mean, you've told me... Son-in-law is laughing, I don't know what to say. Thanks, aunty. Also, I need to buy Raji a nice gift. Tell me what to buy her. - I'm not listening! - Give it to Raji. - She's right here. - I won't listen! - I won't listen! - Tell us aunty! - Tell me son... - Hey! Aunty, think of something nice, I'll call you later... Give the phone to Raji. It's exciting for women to wonder what their husbands will gift them. Think about it. One day, the lights in this police-brain will turn green. What mom? You seem to be into the nightie. Sit down. What happened? Raji told me everything. That her brother raced and how you made him wear a nightie and insulted him? When we wear your pants, we feel it's comfortable. When we wear your shirts we feel proud to wear a man's shirt. Even when we dry your briefs, we don't feel ashamed. We do it wholeheartedly. But you men feel insulted in a woman's clothes is it? We're such an irrelevant species, right? Isn't it something your mothers and sisters wear? Mom He's the one who feels that way. I'm talking about you. Don't you think that it's an insult for a man to wear a woman's clothes? Only because you felt that way you made him wear it, right? He's six years your junior. Change yourself first. Stay grounded. - Sir, please sir. - That's not possible. - Let me just ask them once, please! - No way, now leave! - Madhan - Tell me, aunty. I have good news. Raji... What's that noise? Sorry bro. - Sorry, I didn't hear. - Raji... Just hang up! If you talk about her again I'll block your number just like I blocked her's. Stop! Pull over. - Produce your papers. - What's the load? Just clothes, sir. What? Clothes... - There's nothing other than clothes, sir. - Sir... - Check our papers, sir. - Sir...please... Son, it's been half-an-hour since I kept the food. I need to wash the dishes and get home. Standing in front of me; trying to talk to me; making mini-dosas; if you keep doing these things I'll forget my friends and go back to the police station. Hey! - Why are you talking like that? - I wasn't talking to you. - I'm asking who you were talking to. - It's her! The one who sent me mini-dosas. - Who is it? - I don't know! I knew you'd make amends. But this is overdoing it. Making dosas for him. It might get burnt. Give it to him. Sir Wait a minute. May I come in, sir? What's wrong with you, man? What's your problem with Madhusudhan? The other day it was the Ambulance. Now it's his container. You even called the media on your own. - He's committing crimes in his vehicles. - Yes he is. He didn't do it in your house. It was on the road. - Both are the same for me. - What's with the road-talk? People keep spitting and urinating on the roads. The public doesn't follow the rules. The fault is ours, not the public's. We need to show the people. Like foreign countries. Why are you defending yourself? - Is it the ego of having worked at the Centre? - Rajasekar You're working in the middle of the road. Is it so insulting to work on the roads? No, sir. It's a bridge for people to meet and accomplish. To understand a country, you don't have to go inside houses. The road will tell you how the country is. The road is my office. The blazing sun is my A/C. Even the cemetery is religion-based. But only the signal with its 3 red, yellow and green eyes is not religion-based. Every day the thought of having made a father spend 5 more minutes with his child and knowing I've made a sister from another mother reach on time, helps me sleep well. Every year more than 150,000 people die in road accidents. Tamil Nadu ranks first. 13,000 people. This is only the death-rate. The injured and those in coma are different. Last year 197 people died on the roads I was in-charge of. This year 173 people. 24 people are living today because of me and that gives me job satis... That's what this is. That's what gives me courage to speak like this. It makes me want to prevent crime. The guy who's peddling life-threatening things on a life-saving ambulance! - Hey, what can you do to me? - Sir, please... - What will you do? Shoot me? - Sir, please... You can't do shit! You're not even a cop to me! Do you have a gun? I do! Come on! Shall we? Will you arrest me? - Will you arrest me? - Get your hands off the uniform! I said get your hands off it! Sir, we'll talk it out. Please listen to us. Try imprisoning me! Not just you. I'll imprison your entire family. - Sir! - Let go of me! - Give me the gun! - Listen to us! Wait, just a minute. I don't have a family. But I'll give you the chance of a lifetime! One day. Just one day. Try imprisoning me. You can't even put my dog in a jail. He thinks he can arrest me! What? Why are you silent? Challenge me! Challenge me! You challenge me. I'll win. If we're done, can I leave, sir? - Bye, sister. - Bye. - Bye dad. - Be careful. Hey, I'm on my way. I got into the auto-rickshaw. I'll be there in five minutes, okay? Bye. Is this the day... We've been waiting for? To see each other? Is this the day... We've been waiting for? To reunite? Will I fall for those looks? Will I ever let you go? Can I ever forget the love that brought us together? Will I be next to you? Will I be part of your life? I wonder, like the last drop on the edge of a leaf, anticipating its fall. I swear I'll make you race with me! I need to be next to you whenever I want I need to hold you close to me when we're together I need to drown in your presence, my life... You heart is like that of a child that throws tantrums I wish to hold and nurture that child I lose myself in your laughter It is melody to my ears My life aches to live for you Only the thought of you helps me get through I see you in everything I see you in everything Go away... Is this the day? We've been waiting for? To reunite? I need to be next to you whenever I want I need to hold you close to me when we're together My life... Two minutes. Bye. You think I betrayed you, right? Okay. Madhan, look at me. Just like we travelled today I want to travel with you all my life. I'll be waiting. When? When? I'll get there right now! Aunty... Aunty... These two things were supposed to happen at Raji's wedding. But it didn't happen. This is the ring you need to give your brother-in-law. This... It's the chain your brother-in-law needs to put on for you. For the both of you, using her small savings Mom had bought this. You both need to exchange it. That's my mom's last wish. Thank you. Ma'am. Madhan! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Are you guys hungry? Meow! Break-in! Let me go, sir! - Where is the stash? - Let me go! - Tell me! - I don't know. - Tell me everything! - I don't know anything. - I don't know anything. - Ma'am! Look ma'am. It's in these ghutka raw materials that they're mixing drugs and peddling it. It's atrocius! Not just this. They're mixing cancer causing chemicals in this Pan Masala. Rascals! This is a completely banned business in Tamil Nadu. But every day stash worth millions gets distributed all over the State. School-going teens and daily labourers become addicted to this. Enquire him. Where are the others? He won't speak. We'll make him talk later. Let's go. Ma'am! Yesterday In the Madhavaram-Sengundram area near Chennai Illegal drugs worth millions were found in Madhusudhan's property and has been sealed. Hey! That's our bike! - That's our bike! - Freeze the frame, sir. Zoom in to the registration plate. - 1960, it's our vehicle! - Zoom in towards that red helmet guy. - Yes. - That guy. Yes. - Nosy? - Yes, it's him! - He's got a tattoo. Look! - Yes! - They're caught! Yes! - Copy this to my phone. - Okay. - It's definitely him! This is enough! I need to produce it at the station and get out of that damn house! - But Madhan, the thing is... - Hey Let's show it to the Inspector through your brother-in-law. - Don't talk about him! - Hey, Madhan! - Why do you keep bringing things up? - You step aside! Go on then. Go give it. You'll tell them that the guy without three fingers is the culprit. But the Inspector... He'll say that you're the one who was driving. Take a look. Your brother-in-law has deleted it from YouTube. Only the person who uploads it can delete it. You know, right? So what? He threw a nightie at me the other day to insult me. Get this drilled into your heads. Only for you guys I've been sitting in his house like it's the loo. Hey I'll talk to your sister. He's my enemy. But she's a backstabber. Finding those culprits is my job. Minister, shut up! You've proven to be a politician. You'll come to me with open arms during Elections, right? - I'll deal with you then. - It's Saturday today, the Court... To arrest a prominent person like me you'll definitely have a warrant. The complaint raised by Traffic SI Rajasekar has led to the shutting down of your factories. He's been deputed on the Home Secretary's special permission. You can't even imprison the dog in my house. You think you've won? I'll tell you even now. You can't put me in jail even for a day. Hey When it comes to a challenge I'll go to any extreme! We've crossed Red Hills and are on our way. Hey! What are you doing? Stop! Puzhal Jail is 23kms away from here. I can even be in a hospital for 6 months. But never in jail for even a day. Crash my vehicle. Hey, who are you people? There's someone staying at your house. Ask him, he'll tell you. If you win a traffic race, it's awesome! If you're caught by the cops, it's troublesome! If you race in Chennai, it's awesome! Are you senseless? I told you I got caught in a case and can't race you. Why did you beat him up? Answer him now. - Damn you! - Hey! - Hey! Hold it! - Wait, listen for a minute! Look, you're causing unnecessary trouble. Just because you're a cop you can't take him so easily. Try taking him. You can't behave as you wish. - Hey! - Who are you? It's you isn't it? What is your problem? You're the one who stole my bike, right? - You're the chain snatcher, right? - What chain? You took our bike and stole the chain! Everything is recorded on my phone! There's proof of these fingers and the tattoo. If you have proof you'll take him? Hey, call boss! - Snatching chains you thief! - Don't hit me boss! Come. - Instead of racing you've become a thief! - Sorry boss, don't hit me! Ask him. Sir I wanted him to race that's why I hit your brother. Sorry, sir. Sorry bro. And, Rajasekar... The culprit... The Counsellor has agreed to send him. - There's no issue. - Thank you, sir. It's okay. But they say only if your brother-in-law wins the race the culprit will surrender. What do you say? Sir, you have the culprit and there's evidence. Arrest him. Do your duty. Speak like a Crime Inspector. Rajasekar I was a Crime Inspector when I sent your brother-in-law home without remanding him. You cannot outweigh the local power in some areas. He won't race. I won't let him. The person who has to race is silent. Who the hell are you? I'm his brother-in-law. I don't have a damn brother-in-law or anyone else. No one has to speak in my place. I'll race. Hey If we stay here any longer, it'll be an insult. He's insulting you! Let's leave. Brother, wait. Are you coming or not? Brother What are you saying? He's a young boy. His age is like that. Like our Prabhu. Will we abandon him? There's a limit to every relationship. Prabhu is our brother. Is he your brother? Or friend? Or is he your son? All three isn't it? Brother-in-law. I cannot give up on him. Do whatever you want. I'll be in the car. - Brother - Come... Go away! Hey You don't have to race fearing the case. I'll take care of it. You don't have to give me advice. I'll sign the document, sir. Can I go home if I sign it? I'm telling you not to do it! You're acting all big? What's going on, sir? Is this how you deal with the case? You're young, but you can't have everything! Who is young? Who is the young boy? What are you even thinking? You think no one can question... Hey! Let go! You're trying to get me fired? My job! Get in! You might get me imprisoned! Let go! What do you want? Is the pain intolerable? Please bear with it. Prabhu, get a cloth from the car quickly. Get up slowly. Hey! Your uncle has intervened the race. We have already won. Sir, this time around adorn him in a gorgeous saree isntead of a nightie. You're not getting out of that case anymore. Sir, drop him off at the Puzhal Prison while you're at it. Prabhu, take him to the hospital. Hold him. Get up. We're no longer related. That's over. I'm telling you again. Racing is a mistake. But you have to win this race for sure. For the friends who are waiting at the finish line hoping to get out of this case and for those who think they can cheat and win, your victory will serve justice. Move it bro! He's coming! He's here! Sir! Sir! Does it hurt? It would have been the same for him! Shit! Hands off! This is your race! You have to ride. Hey, it's his brother-in-law! Yes! He won it! Hey! Who is that now? Madhan! Madhan! You, lift him up! Hey! You challenged me. Did you win? Did you beat me? One day. Could you put me in jail for just a day? Tell me. Hey The people who challenge me have never lived on their terms nor have they died on their terms. Who is that? Tell me! Both of them were in the bike together. Our men targeted the cop, but brought him along as well. Hey Who is he? Why was he with you? Hey, who are you? I'm talking to you! How do you know him? Tell me! - He's talking to you! - Stop it! I'm his uncle. A brother-in-law means all three, right? We're not brothers-in-law are we? Tell him you gave me a lift! He gave you a lift? The place he's going now... Son This cop will you give will give you a lift. Run! Catch him! If I catch you, I'll kill you! Catch it! There you are! Call him! Get going! That way! Leave. At least you can escape from here. I said go! If you stay they will kill you as well. Shit! Please don't hate your sister! You're always in her mind. You're her everything! My Raji! It's from her shawl. My Raji...Raji... I left her at the hosptial... Raji... What? Hospital? Why? My phone! Phone... Socks...it's in my socks! Control Room? Raj... It's our baby, Raj! The nurse just gave her to me. She's crying with eagerness to see her father! Raj! This moment, as I'm holding our baby... the day my brother was born... I held him... and placed him on my lap... and threw a tantrum, not letting anyone take him... is what this moment reminds me! Raj, please! Is it possible to somehow tell him that I've become a mother of a child? If he knows he'll forget everything and come visit me, won't he? He'll... He'll call me 'Kitty', won't he? Kitty is my mom and I'm her dad! Kitty will always be my mother! It was me! I made a mistake! - I'll only marry if I like someone. - You don't know anything! I'm the one who'll find the groom! I need to like him as well! I can't stand the sight of him! Who asked you to come here? Go with him already! It was me...trying to be her dad... I never understood my Kitty! Poor thing, my Kitty! Not just you. All of us... are controlling our women in the name of love. I feel sad... for our Kitty... Forgive me, Kitty! Please forgive me, Kitty! Will you go visit your sister? Please take care of my Raji, okay? You will, right? Raji... Raji... You! I'm right here! You! Why are fighting for someone you gave lift to? Tell me! Tell me I say! Who gave a lift? He's my brother-in-law! I'm his brother-in-law! He's my brother-in-law! You must not die so easily! At least one day you must be in jail! If my brother-in-law has to win the challenge you must be in jail at least for a day! Brother-in-law... Wearing a helmet and riding feels like Kavin riding with a chair on hear head. Madhan! How are you doing? I won an important race! But now my life is miserable... Damn! It's nothing sweetheart! It's almost done, my cutiepie! Damn it, uncle! You messsed it up! You could have played this card! Sister... Look at the brothers-in-law coming together! - Here. - I'll call you back. - Not there, here. - Take a look at that. Wait, Raji. What is it baby? Dad will be right back. How many girlfriends do you have? - Just one! - Really? Brother-in-law! - Yes? - What does your brother-in-law say? He has only one girlfriend apparently. - He's upset. - Really? Really? Yes, brother-in-law. He broke up with the other one! Hey! Yes...
