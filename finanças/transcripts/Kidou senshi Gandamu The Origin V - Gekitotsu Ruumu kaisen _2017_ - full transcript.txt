The history of mankind is also a history of warfare. Why does humanity endlessly repeat these foolish, sad conflicts? And... Why do people fight? The zabi family alone will shoulder the responsibility of the history to come. Some fight for the power of their family. The ral family? It's as good as dead! Brought down by you lot! While others fight for the sake of their own pride. And this man? Why does he continue to fight? I am the son of zeon zum deikun. I'll grow up and make degwin and the rest of you bow down to me!

Right! Move out! Animosity towards the federation reaches its breaking point within zeon, and a counteroffensive against federation security forces is launched by military academy cadefs. Fire! A colony state can't win against the federation! Well, as to that... We'll never know unless we try, will we? A showdown is imminent why did those poor children have to be born into this world as deikun's progeny? You have to grow up to be a fine person and make lots and lots of people happy. These siblings have always been at the mercy of the times and a sad fale. Just for one night, I wish I could be with my children. It's just too sad, what's happening to her. She's going to die... Perhaps these two were never meant lo have a moments rest artesia... mother is... She's dead. Separated from his mother wait! Don't go, brother! Casval! And from his only family, his sister, the man becomes an avenger. To this man, revenge in and of itself is a righteous calise. And humanity rushes on towards a war the likes of which it has never known. I would like to build a new relationship with the federation. However, it will be on the condition of the seizure of federation assets here and the complete withdrawal of federation forces. The world, it seems, is intent on taking this all the way. Fire! Mobile suits, weapons that zeon had developed in secret they possess fearsome combat capabilities. Dr. minovsky... has finally done it! We'll show them what real mobile suits can do! Another one down! You should take this to heart. Zeon already possesses such power. My father, degwin, will name himself its sovereign and declare our independence any time now! Sieg zeon! Sieg zeon! Sieg zeon! Sieg zeon! My enemy, your enemy, mother's enemy, everyone's! I'll take them out! Fire! Wh-why?! Casval! Casval.. Did you really die? Whenever the righteous causes of differing people clash, a new war is the result I give you the rx-78! Codename, "gundam"! And will there ever be an end lo this man's war? Everything is red. It really is a good color, isn't it? Stop firing! Please! The worst war in human history is beginning. Mobile suit gundam the origin v u.c. 0079, January 3rd The principality of zeon declares war on the earth federation. Universal century 0078, January 3rd. The principality of zeon declares war on the earth federation. The zeon fleet, led by vice admiral dozle zabi, crushes the e.F.S.F.'S cruiser fleet, utterly wiping it out. A mobile suit assault force led by maj. Gen. Kycilia zabi seizes control of the lunar city of granada. She then goes on lo take Von braun, as well. I'm not out of the fight yet! And on that same day, zeon also declares war against side 2, called hatfe, which has steadfastly maintained ils anti-zeon stance, and attacks it. Side 2 will be burned by the fires of heaven' just deserts for those who dared turn against the noble spacenoid cause' they have received a punishment that they brought down upon themselves! Commander! Commander ral! We ve eliminated most of the enemy's resistance. This isn't war... It was the federation that turned the foolish leaders of hatte against us! They are the true enemy! It's a slaughter! My fellow countrymen! 150 million distinguished citizens of zeon! Our fight has just begun! Let us march ever onwards in perfect unison! Together! Until our day of victory! Clash at loum The fighting in hatle continues. The Halle government put out a call for aid fo all colonies and the federation government [ast night. The zeon forces' attack appears to encompass almost all of hatte's banchis. Um, it's hayato. Mr. Kai says to come oul. But they are at a clear disadvantage against their zeon attackers. Also, with the exception of side 6, riah, which has declared neutrality, and side 7, noa, whose construction has only just begun, the other sides appear... And side 7, noa, whose construction has only just begun, the other sides appear... And side 7, noa, whose construction has only just begun, the other sides appear... And side 7, noa, whose construction has only just begun, the other sides appear... This is no time to stay cooped up, right? They say there's a war on. I wasn't really... Your old man's in charge of the development sector, isn't he? Maybe he's really in the military! Hey. If we're gonna go check out the development sector, let's get to it. I've got judo practice this morning. Huh? You're going to the development sector? Something fishy's going on in there. I wanna know what they're up to. But my dad... my dad said not to go near there! You're such a daddy's boy, amuro! If you always do what your folks say, don't you think so? Okay! Roll out! We're seven! Side seven! Strike a victory pose and go aye-aye-oh! We're seven! Side seven! Strike a... Mr. Kai, this looks really dangerous! Say what? Kal, you chicken! Move over! Is he kidding? Just leave it to Kai shiden! Let's go! Mr. Kai! Don't sweat it! This place is gonna be new living space for us someday, right? So I say we take a little peek at what's on the other side of that wall! Do not resist! Step out of the vehicle immediately! I say again! Step out of the vehicle with your hands in the air! If you resist, we will open fire again! These guys are... They're federation soldiers! You stupid punks! What were you thinking?! Which of you dumbasses is the leader?! Let me guess, it was you! All of you, let's see your ID cards! I'm confiscating them! On your feet, punk! Commander. Hey! Punk! I mean, you! Are you chief tem Ray's son? Y-yes, that's right. You need to inform us of stuff like that right off the bat! You don't need to stay with these delinquents! Go on home, you hear? Okay, you stinking punks! What a stupid stunt to pull! Do you wanna get beaten to death?! Well, that's what you're gonna get! There has been a most unpleasant incident! Several students in this class stole a construction vehicle and tried to enter the development sector! They were released, thank goodness, but they might not get off so easy next time! As you know, the principality of zeon and the earth federation are now fighting! During this time of crisis, we must all do our utmost not to do anything dangerous! And do not, under any circumstances, go near the development sector! Have I made myself clear? Commander ramba ral has arrived! Good! You're here! The opening fleet battle was a resounding victory! We sure showed that revil how it's done! What's with you? Why the glum face? Can't you be happy about our victory? If I had my druthers, I would rather have fought in the fleet battle. Hatte's forces are of no consequence. There was no need to declare war on them. Don't talk like that. That's island iffish, isn't it? We could have taken it in half a day if we felt like it. We were ordered to leave it untouched, though. That's precisely why I called you here. Brilliant man that he is, supreme leader gihren came up with an ingenious plan. A plan to end this war with victory for us in one fell swoop! We're going to murder the citizens and drop the colony?! Shh! Don't use that word. It makes it sound like we're doing something bad. - You two! - Sir! This is between me and the commander! Get lost! Yes, sir! Look, this is war! We declared war on hatte, an enemy country, and we beat them! - Even so... - Wait! Let me continue! Take a good look at this! We'll attach external engines to the colony, take it out of orbit, send it into low earth orbit, and drop it on federation general hq at jaburo! Now do you see? They anticipated there would be a war with us, so they built jaburo under 1,000 meters of bedrock, but this will flatten even that! - You want me to do this? - I do! Using your mobile suit forces! I refuse! You what?! Now I get it. This is something that lord gihren would come up with. But a military man like you should never even suggest such a thing! This is the work of the devil! The devil?! Look who's talking! You have the blood of a hundred million hatte civilians on your hands! You're well and truly a devil yourself! Those hatte guys will be dead either way! So wouldn't you say that making their deaths count for something is the sensible thing to do here?! I would not! Why the hell not?! Admiral dozle. This war is madness. Zeon zum deikun would never have ordered this war. I want no part of it! Wait! Wait, damn it! I'm the one who got you your double-bump promotion! You're in the way, step aside! Wait! Hold it! Wait, damn you! Don't come crying to me when this comes back to bite you on the ass! Island iffish Hey! Don't waste ammo! You zeon bastards, come get some! Yuki! Fang li! Where are you going? We're evacuating to the shelter! What about you? Docking bay guard duty! Hey, don't! You could have broken your neck! Let's all evacuate together! Join us, yuki! I can't do that! But I'll escort you there! Do you suppose all the other banchis were lost to them? Probably. But we'll be safe here. What makes you say that? This is the capital banchi, and we have plenty of shelters. Trust me, fang li. The federation forces are gonna come help. You think? I sure hope so. Heat-resistant coating application going smoothly. Too slow! Pick up the pace! What are those zeon maniacs up to? They probably want to make it so we can't see out. Damnit... If they're gonna come, I wish they'd get it over with! Hey, shouldn't you be getting to the docking bay? It's fine. I'll guard the shelter you guys are in. Do you even know how to use that thing? Sure I do. It's easier than playing the guitar. Things sure have gotten crazy, huh? Given everything that's happening, you should have gone to earth sooner. I couldn't. The yashima company's training institute opens in April. That's so weird. It is not. Aprils in Japan are the best. It's when the cherry blossoms bloom. Cherry blossoms? Well, I haven't seen them myself. They scatter and fall like yuk7 snow. "Yuki"? It's not much, but I have some Japanese blood in me. They tell me that the name "yuki" is Japanese, too. Yuki... yuki, like snow. That yuki is different! My yuki means brave! I do love the show, though. Oh, so it snows in Japan. That sounds nice. I'd love to go there sometime. So let's go. Once all this is over. Go together? Yep. You and me. Heat-resistant coating application complete. Defenders at docking bay largely eliminated. Booster attachment work proceeding smoothly. Shelter ♪12 is about to close! Stay right here, okay? Don't go to the docking bay! Pumping in gg gas! There's a wind of about 10 meters per second blowing inside. It should spread pretty quickly. Elapsed gas pumping time, 5 minutes. It's nothing personal. We're doing this to end this war quickly. Anyway... I doubt you'd want to see the surface of the earth rushing up at you. It's cold... Why is... it so cold? It's snow! It even snows in colonies! I have to tell fang li! Wow, why is it so cold? What's wrong with them? Asleep at their posts... It's our job to keep the shelter safe, guys... Have to get up... If I fall asleep out here, I'll... catch cold... I wanna go inside, too... Fang li... Open up... Let mein... Let me... In, please. Universal century 0079, January 10th. Island iffish, mother banchi of side 2, Halle, leaves its lagrange point and enters a freefall trajectory towards earth. Its estimated point of impact is south America's guiana highlands, beneath which lies jaburo, the earth federation's general hq. The fleet of vice admiral tianem, which had been making its way lo the engagement area with the zeon forces, abruptly changes its objective. It tries fo destroy the colony, but is unsuccessftil/ January 15th. Island iffish arrives in low earth orbit January 16th. It splits in three, and each part enters the atmosphere. The impact of island iffish wrotight havoc on the earth. Southern Australia, struck squarely by the bay section, was utterly destroyed. And the enormous land section lhat struck southwestern Canada caused debris fo rain down across most of America. The section that came down mn the pacific triggered massive quakes and isunamis in densely-populated east Asia. The earth's crust and atmosphere were torn asunder. The fatalities that resulted from this lterrible calamity were so vast that they were not fully grasped for some time, but when deaths from disease and starvation were also included, it became clear that the final tally was roughly half of the world's population. However, the war had only just begun. Our most pressing matter at the moment is how to deal with side 5, loum. Loum is still split. Between siding with us, or standing with the federation. The difference between them and hatte is that they have already been promised powerful federation support. The tianem fleet that is now en route to Miranda is the most powerful in the e.F.S.F. This fact has had a major impact on public opinion there. The forces opposed to us have gained the upper hand. Loum must also be purged. If we are to be victorious in our holy war, loum will be crucial. You've already killed billions... All the blood that has been spilled still isn't enough for you?! How many people we have killed... rather, how many have died, is unimportant! All that matters is victory over our enemy! Given that jaburo yet exists and the federation shows a clear intent to resist, we... That is the result of our own plan failing. Isn't that right? Those who carried out operation British will, of course, be punished severely. And the person who oversaw them will also be made accountable. I'm referring to you as the one who came up with this plan, gihren. We merely need to emerge the Victors! Assuming that you do not wish to be prosecuted as war criminals, you should put your faith in me, the man best suited to provide the leadership we need to win! I'm returning to my chambers! Garma! Lend me your shoulder. Y-yes, father! Oh, my. It would seem that even our dear father is getting on in years... Zenna! Mineva! I'm home! Are you still up?! Zenna! Mineva! Mineva! You were a good girl and waited up for me? Coochie coochie coo! How I've missed you! Oh, you're awake?! It's papa! Papa! Your daddy! I'm your daddy! Now, now, did he scare you? Your daddy is so naughty... Is... she asleep? She's asleep. She plays all day and tires herself out. She's so cute... My one mineva is so adorable, but I... How many hundreds of millions of minevas have I killed?! Mineva burst into tears the instant she saw my face. Is my face that terrifying? Do I have the face of a devil or an ogre? I do, don't I? Don't be silly. Mineva was grouchy because she was sleepy, that's all. Is that true? Is that really true? I hope you're right... I liked our family better before... When we all lived in this house, we all got along. My brother sasro was here, too. And garma was so tiny and cute. Well, garma still ls cute now... Zenna! I I intend to make sure that you don't regret marrying into the zabi family! Let's build a new history for the zabis together! Bear me lots of children! Little brothers for mineva! And little sisters! Lots of good little children! And I'll keep those children safe! Anyone who tries to lay a hand on you or mineva will have to go through me, no matter who they are! Oh, that's it! That's the underlying truth of all wars! When you have loved ones, you must fight! The people of hatte, the federation, it's their own fault for being weak! They couldn't keep their minevas safe! Pathetic, that's what it is! I'm not like them! I'll crush them all! I won't let them lay a finger on my mineva and zenna! I'll never be beaten! Oh, no... you woke her! I'm so sorry! Your daddy loves to shout so! I'm sorry. Side 5, loum capital banchi, Miranda sieg zeon! Sieg zeon! Zeons go home! Zeons go home! The military has mobilized fo keep the peace. They are opening fire on the pro-zeon protesters. The loum government appears lo have hardened ils anti-zeon position with federation military backing. - We're full here! - Send them to another hospital! Doctor! This kid's in bad shape! Please! Save my baby! I'll administer first aid. Put him on the sofa over there. Miss artesia, I presume? No, you're mistaken. Here is my identification. Could I trouble you for a few minutes of your time? Your name is it. Tachi? You're an odd one. I've never had an intelligence operative show me his ID before. It's been a long time, lady artesia. When you and master casval escaped munzo, I played a part in it. Admittedly, all I really did was follow Mr. ral's instructions to get you past customs. Would you mind cutting to the chase? It's not that I'm not interested in hearing what you have to say, but I can't stay here for long right now. I'm well aware. Because of all the riots. But I wouldn't have been able to see you if it werent such a situation. Intelligence operative or no, it's no easy task to get the drop on the kycilia agency. You know a man named char aznable, don't you? Mr. char? What about him? He was expelled from the academy for inciting the cadet uprising. But after that, he made a name for himself piloting a red mobile suit, Rose from enlisted man to lieutenant, and is now the young hero of zeon. Keep a close eye on this man. What do you mean? And one other thing! Casval rem deikun is alive and well! Of course, that's only my personal conviction at this point. Wait! I can't stay long. If anyone found out I was a zeon, I'd be killed slowly and painfully. Lt. Tachi! Yes, I'll be right... Mr. aznable? Miss sayla, Mr. teabolo's collapsed! They tell me it was a heart attack. Could you come home right away? Hello? Miss sayla? Can you hear me? It's me! Aznable! Roger aznable! Hello? Hello? Are you there, miss sayla? Lunar city, granada pilot inspection! Go to test mode! - L3 Gauge isn't climbing! - Start with l5! We're attaching more powerful thrusters to the backpack. We're attaching more powerful we're attaching more powerful thrusters to the backpack. The nozzles' range of motion has been increased by 50%. We're also attaching custom fins. Well, well! These new zaku models don't look too shabby at all! Just the thing for us black tri-stars! I like that star emblem in particular! After all, appearance is everything, am I right? What was that just now? That flashy horn! That red color deliberately meant to stand out from the crowd! Nobody but him would do something so obnoxious! Damn it, I was right! Mechanic! I'm only getting 80% output from the sub-thrusters! That's not the response level I requested, now is it? Well, given the stress on the pilot, we thought that a limiter was a must. I don't need it. Remove it. Hey! You! Oh, you're here for inspections, too? You seem eager to see your personal machines completed. It char, I suppose I should congratulate you on making officer again. A quick double-bump promotion at that! While commander ral's been demoted to lieutenant in the reserves... That red officer's uniform looks good on you, lieutenant. Isn't that against regs? You know, not wearing a normal suit while piloting a mobile suit? Lt. Gaia. If the mobile suit I'm piloting is destroyed, I'll be just as dead regardless of what I'm wearing. I'm heading right back out! You three seem oddly fixated oh promotions. If you want to climb the ranks, too, I suggest you do something to earn it. Loum will be the ideal battlefield to do just that. The chance of a lifetime for you three. Who will perform the best at loum? It's a competition, gentlemen of the black tri-stars. Side 5, loum we re coming to you live from Miranda bay. The outflow of pro-zeon citizens continues amidst a stale of high alert by the military and police. This is becatse it now seems tnavoidable that the loum area will turn into a battlefield the tragedy of hatte, whose capital banchi was dropped on earth, is causing everyone lo lose their senses. He seems to be stabilized now. We can all rest a little easier now that you are here. You're going to zeon? If we stay here, there's no telling what they'll do to us as hostile citizens. I'd like to relocate to zeon while there are still flights there. Besides... Besides? There's the matter of my son, char. I'm not interested in seeing the man who has become a zeon hero. Still... even if he hasn't written us a single letter, he's still our only son. I can... certainly sympathize. I'm dreadfully sorry, doing something so self-centered at a time like this. Don't worry about it, Mr. aznable. I'm grateful for everything that you've done for us here. Hearing that means the world to me! It was our pleasure. I have faith that our paths will cross again! Casval... You know a man named char aznable, don't you? You know a man named char aznable, don't you? Casval rem deikun is alive and well! Casval rem deikun is alive and well! Casval.. What did you do lo that poor boy? Universal century 0079, January 23rd. The e.F.S.F. Third fleet, launched from the newly-constructed jaburo base, rendezvous with admiral revil's first fleet, which had been standing by in the Luna ii area, and immediately sels out for the loum area, located across from earth. With this force that vastly outnumbers the combined zeon forces, the federation intends fo settle the war in one blow. Zeon forces flagship, great degwin a battle at loum will decide the outcome of the war. Or rather, it must decide it! Steel your resolve, gentlemen! I expect that the e.F.S.F. Is burning with desire for revenge over the blow it received in operation British. We mustn't underestimate its will to fight. Only through all our forces uniting as one under our sovereign and staking the very survival of our principality will victory be possible! Now, let us begin the operation briefing. Vice admiral dozle, supreme commander of our fleets. Never forget! If we lose, every last one of us is a war criminal! It'll be the gallows for us! The enemy's forces are split in two. One is vice admiral tianem"s fleet, which is sticking close to the loum area. It is composed of 15 Magellan-class battleships, 45 salamis-class cruisers, as well as lepanto-class missile frigates, landing craft, and so on. This fleet alone is on par with our entire fleet. Plus, revil's main force is also coming! This one will probably be three times the size of the tianem fleet! A real armada! A force four times our size? Yes! Four times! We can do nothing about the gap in fighting strengths at this point! Which is why... We will 70 be using some inane plan to further divide our own smaller force and attack each of theirs! We will hit the tianem fleet with everything we have! And? What do you intend to do about revil's main force? As for him, we will hit revil's force with the special assault regiment launched from a baoa qu! Special assault regiment? Er... What's that? I know that you generals are unfamiliar with it. However, the unit has already proven quite capable in the opening hostilities. For this mission, I'll organize it into two battalions and throw the revil fleet into confusion! Sieg zeon! Sieg zeon! Sieg zeon! Sieg zeon! Sieg zeon! Sieg zeon! Sieg zeon! Sieg zeon! Sieg zeon! Sieg zeon! Sieg zeon! Sieg zeon! Sieg zeon! Well, you two, I'm off. Clamp? You leaving already? Yo, commander! Er, lieutenant, I mean... Cozun! It's been a dog's age! How about it? Join me? I'd love to, but the transport convoy will be leaving soon. They say this battle will determine who rules the world, so if you're late you'll be branded a traitor. Oh, I see. Get going, then. I volunteered, thinking I could serve with you again if I was a zaku pilot. That was mean, lieutenant, mustering out first like that. Petty officer cozun Graham! Now shipping out to the loum front line! Fine, go! But just remember! The zabis are a bunch of murderers! Whatever you do, don't die for the likes of them! You don't need to shed a drop of your own blood for them! Who's there? I'm sorry, but we're closed. Why, it's been ages! I hear you're in intelligence now. I need you to run. Agents from the kycilia agency are coming. I hear they're going to arrest you and the lieutenant for insubordination. Is it. Ramba ral here? Lt. Ral is asleep in back. What's this about? An arrest warrant has been issued for his refusal to obey a direct order during operation British. If you shelter him, we'll haul you in, too. He's already been punished with a two-rank demotion. Besides, the order he refused came from vice admiral dozle! It didn't come from kycilia! If she wants to arrest him, she's going to have to bring the warrant herself, not send flunkies like you to do her dirty work! You tell her that crowley hamon said so. Deep in my mind, neon signs shining bright smoke faded into the night the door s left ajar, with a glimmer of hope just so you come back again. Time goes by, goes by... No matter how hard you fry, don't say good bye, good bye... now that our story has come lo an end. Feel your life bursting info flames every day, everywhere. 1 believe in eternity. The stream of time never stops, never sels me free... The fown's fast asleep. It's asleep, dreaming of you. Melting the ice, throughout the night... Won't shed a tear... And I'll keep holding on... Until you come back fo me. Lonely night, so lonely... In such a distant world, there is no choice, twon't be afraid now is the time fo stand strong against fate. Feel me close, even when in pain. Every day, everywhere. I will love you eternally. The stream of time never stops, never sels me free... Oh, no! I'm sorry, I nodded off for a minute. It's fine. Mr. teabolo is resting comfortably. What's all that about? Oh, dear! There's a fire in the village! What's going on?! Who's there?! Hey, hold it right there! If you don't stop, we'll shoot! - Help! - You've got to help us! Thugs came in from the bay and started attacking the village! Mr. aznable's house is on fire, too! They said they're going to kill everyone in the park because we're zeon supporters! They'll come here, too! They're here! Build some barricades! Seal up the doors and windows! We'll fight them! What the...?! What in the world?! What's happening? Where did sayla go? Where's my sayla?! Sayla! Sedatives! Bring me sedatives! - Do we have weapons? - All kinds! They're old, though! How about this one? A Winchester model 1873! It's a lever-action, and it's loaded with 8 bullets! Those bastards! Chew on this! Bunch of animals! Federation, zeon, they re all the same! All there is... is madness! What drove them mad? Hatred? Greed? Or was it .. Don't run! Put out the fire! Go to the back of the hall upstairs! Everything will be fine! Excuse me... I'm terribly sorry. I did what I could, but this sudden commotion must have been too much for him... I'm sorry, Mr. teabolo. You did so much for us... You were a wonderful father. You really were. What's that? - Is it dawn already? - No, it can't be dawn vet... Miranda's bay, it's... It's under attack! Please remain calm! Please take your seats and fasten your safety belts! - It's not safe to get up! - Honey! I thought we would finally be able to see our boy again! Artesia... If there is such a thing as divine protection, then you shouldn't be here right now. Texas, eh? The bay's been destroyed! We can't go back now! Piloting a red mobile suit... Piloting a red... A red... mobile suit! Side 5, loum area side 5, loum area tianem fleet Miranda's been attacked? Yes, sir. There are multiple damage reports from all side 5 banchis. Their bay areas seem to be largely crippled. What's going on? Wasn't zeon going to focus entirely on a fleet battle? Perhaps we should divert some ships to defend loum? Chief of operations. If someone is to go to loum, we of the second fleet are currently closest. However, we are also the ones who are closest to the zeon fleet. If we turned around now, we'd be struck from behind by the dozle fleet. Let's leave loum to revil. We began this operation based on intel that revil himself received. Open space outside side 5 open space outside side 5 e.F.S.F. Main force open space outside side 5 revil combined first & third fleet flagship, ananke the enemy's hit Miranda's bay? The Garrison fleet is stuck there. They are requesting assistance. Hm, this isn't what we anticipated... The bay area appears fo be heavily damaged.

But be that as it may... We can't ignore this. Send Cunningham's and wakkein's fleets there. Yes, sir. Also, send enough supply and landing ships to provide civilian aid. Yes, sir. Inform the bridge that the combined first & third fleet will stay on this course. Yes, sir! All right, men. This is somewhat sooner than expected, but still... Yes, sir. Begging your pardon, sir. Our fleet has arrived at the final defense line in the orbit between side 3 and the moon. After vice admiral dozle's fleet, which forms the core of this operation, set sail from the homeland, he has been advancing towards the loum front under radio silence. All hands! Salute our fatherland, the principality of zeon! The fleet seems to have already finished spreading out into battle formation. Revil combined first & third fleet the enemy vanguard also appears to be spreading out to both flanks. Revil combined first & third I dad... I mean, father... I was so wrong! Dad... I mean, father... - T'was so wrong! Revil combined first & third fleet the revil fleet, the main force behind it, shows no... Revil combined first & third I I should have requested a position in the space forces, not the ground forces! I should have requested a position in the space forces, not the ground forces! Revil combined first & third fleet strike that, new enemy activity! The revil fleet has split into two groups. One has changed course towards loum. They appear to have fallen for our diversionary operation. This alters our relative fighting strengths considerably. It is now roughly 3 to 1. Also, there has been a report from the commando team sent to loum. - That's the team that char's in! - "Attack successful! Mission accomplished. No losses to friendly forces. Upon retrieval of mobile suit forces, will make for loum area and rendezvous with special assault regiment." Zeon mobile assault force special assault regiment The real battle is here at last! This'll be the opening act of a new kind of warfare! And you are gonna have the starring role! Beat the federation! You hear me? Beat them! If we win, the world's our oyster! Rank! Glory! And even money! And one other thing! There's a weirdo in red named char out there! We'll beat him, too! Make damn sure he doesn't snatch the sweetest prize from us! Let's get to it! E.f.s.f. Flagship, ananke tianem fleet almost within firing range of enemy. Let's have them engage. Minovsky particle status? It's already interfering with our radar and datalinks. Recon craft status? Sir. We put together an extra rotation in addition to our regular patrols. We've had them circling nonstop since this morning. Even war has no choice but to change. Let's get up to the bridge. - Pass along new intel as it comes in. - Yes, sir. Distance now less than 10,000. Enemy composition is: Battleship groups, 3; cruiser groups, 8; Fleet defense groups, 4; cruiser groups, 8; Fleet defense groups, 4; at a time like this, all I can do is sit and watch! Sese ee fee ee mee ir tl tee er sse neen AAA fighters, 224 in 16 squadrons. Fighters, 224 in 16 squadrons. I bet char is on his way to the enemy fleet right now! Calm yourself, garma! In this world, there are those whose deaths do not matter, and those to whom death is not permitted. Apply yourself so that you will be ready when the time is right. With all due respect, father! I can't possibly think of our soldiers' sacrifices in that... Minovsky particle dispersal appears to be increasing. Density increase is continuing unabated. Visual quality is degrading. The battle is beginning. Minovsky particle density has reached combat levels. - Capacitors holding steady. - Bearing 181, confirmed. All hands, prepare for barrage! - All hands, prepare to fire! - All hands, prepare to fire! Prepare to fire! - Launch tubes 1-3, loading confirmed! - Switching system over to Cannon fire! Stabilizers activated. Safeties disengaged. Bearing 181-012. Parameters entered! Commence barrage! Our fleet has struck the first blow. But the enemy has the better firing range! They do, but that is not a problem. Our firepower is inferior to the federation's, but our fleet's musai-class has excellent hit deflection due to its smaller cross-section, and the agility afforded by the placement of its thrusters allows it to easily take evasive act... Wh-what was... A ship was hit. A direct hit, it would seem. That ship, was it dozle's valkyrie?! N-no, sir. It was hit! What was that about agility?! What was that about hit deflection?! One of our ships got destroyed already! Garma! Calm yourself, damn it! It's unseemly! Retvizan heavily damaged. Kiel also damaged from enemy fire. That's the third ship of our advance fleet we've lost. Zalopek, engines offline! Bertin and amagi both appear to have been hit. Rheinland has given order to abandon ship. Okay! It's time to change formation! Inform all ships! A a se a na I I a ail irae eee = ee ee === == eee sa San == ee ae = - - ea = this is do-or-die time! Don't fall behind! Sorry, but you're going to be wiped out in our first engagement. Zeon bastards... Sir! The tianem fleet has engaged the enemy! I'm launching. Open the halch. Wait until the captain gives the order, it char. I'm the one in charge of the attack team, ensign dren. I'm going in ahead. Denim! Take command of the team and follow me. Can you do that? Roger that, sir. Good grief... It's bad for the health to be teamed up with a winner of the zeon cross, eh, sir? Begin launch procedures. Okay. Bosun, confirm that he has clearance! Begin launch procedures! All units! Proceed fo combat area at full speed! - Do it just like we practiced! - Keep up! Form up on me! There it is, the main federation force! This will change the course of history! Bow down before me, god! Translation, adaptation and subtitling: David Fleming
