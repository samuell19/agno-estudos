How do you know my name? I'm sorry, can you frame my tits out? You are Serafina Parker, yes? From Thunder Bay? Your mother is Katherine Parker? My mom? How's she doing? Any news on her condition? Oh, my God. There's a lady in that fucking barrel! Is she out of her coma? How are you doing with all this? It's got to be so traumatic. Um... No comment. This must be the most bizarre story of the year. A severed finger and a severe concussion. The barrel actually saved her life, forming an air bubble preventing her from drowning. How did she not get sucked down into a whirlpool? A one-in-a-million chance! Back to you, Brett. Oh my God. Fucking crazy, this insane old woman, she just like... I've seen it. What the are you still doing here? She's just some crazy old lady... Jesus, is that you? And if you think I'm gonna cry over these news cameras like some baby, then you are crazy than she is. Get the fuck out. I'm serious. Leave. Clearly, Nicki Parker, daughter of Katherine Parker is in no mood to talk. Get the off my property. - Have you seen my hat? - Her mother is now known as... The Conqueror of Kakabeka on social media. Her trip over the waterfalls has become a viral meme taking over TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter. This must be the... Hi. This is Finn Parker. And, um, my mom is... She's not in very good shape, so I can't make it into work today. Yeah. Thank you. It's Paris. You have to come home! I found out that mom is in a coma from a fucking reporter. Yeah, well, she went over the falls on purpose. What do you mean she did it on... She did it on purpose? Oh, my God. Please, Finn. Just come home. Is her finger back on? I don't think... I don't think I can come home. Look, whatever happened, it happened a long time ago, okay? Nicki said... I don't know, Finn. Can you just please come the fuck home? How far to the airport? A woman nicknamed Conqueror of Kakabeka has hurled herself over the Kakabeka Falls. Can you... Can you turn that off? She is in a coma. Oh, my God.

There's a lady in that fucking barrel. Hey. Jesus. You look older. Yeah. Are you juuling? Why do you still look the same? Oh, no. I don't... I don't look the same. Yeah, you're right. You look a lot older. Around 12 to 15 years. You know, some commercial shark fishermen catch sharks, cut off their fins, and just throw the bodies back in the ocean? What are you watching? Adam Pelley. He's coming Duluth on the weekend. Because fish and sharks reach a reproductive age around 12 to 15 Years. It's all mom's stuff. She was cleaning the house before. I just I wanted to bring some of her favourite things to the hospital for her. Jesus. Fuck me! There's coffee. I broke one of Dad's mugs taking it out for you. Thanks for coming. When I got Paris to call you she, um... You got Paris to call me? She didn't tell you that? No. How are you? Don't ask. I'm fucking fine. I'm researching. Learning ombre. We're doing it at my salon now... You know, you could have called me. Yeah. Okay, look, I know it's fucked that everything is in boxes. Why is everything in boxes? She can't be controlled when she's like this. You remember that. I'm sure. Wait, smile. Smile. Smile! Oh, holy fuck. You got your teeth fixed. How much did that cost? Like, five grand? Sorry, talk faster. Mom's in a coma. Jesus Christ. You packed an overnight bag? I didn't realize you had to get back to something so quickly. Hi. You're staying in mom's room. You can't expect me to eat this filth. I made you "kenaw." It's pronounced "keen-wah." Is it fun to be a genius? Yeah. You guys collecting? Mom's been really into modern feminist art recently. She's been reading everything she can about it. There was a twofer sale at Goodwill. Finn. You're sitting on Mom's seat. I'm going to go see her after dinner. You have school tomorrow. Who gives a fuck? I'll go. I was planning on going. Do I do any bullshit lying? What? I heard Mom talking about Finn last night even when I had my ears covered. I didn't say that. Berlin, shush. Oh, my God. Finn. I wanted to ask you a question. I've been wondering. Where did Thunder Bay News get that photo of Mom? What photo? You know, that one from my first wedding to Hamish. Your only wedding. The man that you told not to marry me because marrying me was like "Nostradeemus" predicting the 12 prophecies that ended the world. Nostradamus. And I don't know, Nicki. I assumed it was from your Facebook seeing as you upload of 50 selfies a day. Who uses Facebook anymore? I don't have any photos of Mom on my Facebook. Finn, how would you know what I post? Okay. I'll have a little more. Yeah, great, have some more. Thank you, Nicki. I will. You should. Nothing bad ever happens when Finn Parker gets drunk. When I get drunk? I'm having wine, too. No. Oh. Nicki, what's worse? A drunk or a slut? I don't know. Ask Dad. Mom always lets me have wine. Yeah, well, Mom also thinks that it's a good idea to go over the falls in a whiskey barrel. So, is that really a great example? Like you know what Mom thinks. Nobody knows what she thinks, Paris, not even her. She's fucking crazy. Dad was the crazy one. Not mom. You don't remember him. You just think she's crazy because she's real. She doesn't do any bullshit lying like the rest of you. Okay, Paris. Relax. Don't touch me! Jesus. Shut up! Nicki's right, you don't even live here.

Is Paris okay? The sooner she accepts Mom doesn't walk on water the easier all this is going to be. She's scared. That's a deep and nuanced perspective, Finn. You have to clean the house up. If she comes back and it's all packed up, then she'll have something to say about it If she doesn't come back, then everything's boxed up. Okay. I'll fix it. Was she taking her meds? Oh, my God. There's a lady... - You seen this? - ...In that fucking barrel. Her meds haven't worked for ten years, you know that. What does Berlin know about me? That you're his aunt. Hi, mom. I'm home. Why did Katherine Parker do this? How did she not get sucked down into a whirlpool? A one-in-a-million chance. Hey. Hi. I thought maybe you... Yeah. How's your mom? She's, um, still in a coma. I ran into her last week at the grocery store. She said that she was thinking about taking a trip to Minneapolis, like... She seemed like she was planning for a future. Like she wanted one. I'm really sorry. Don't apologize to me. I came here to say I'm sorry. For what? That I just left like that. You don't owe me that. A couple months of rent, maybe. How long are you staying for? I don't know. I think probably just a couple days. Oh, Jesus! Who's the dad? You can't be that far behind. Oh, fuck off. Well, congratulations. You look good. He's in the back. What? He's in the pool room. Who? Gord. You're not here to see him? Gord... Gord's here? Now? Gord Vaughn is always here. Marv! Shut up. You're not here to see him? No. Fuck no. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I don't give a shit about Gord. Gord, there's a chick out here to see you. Well, fuck. Who knew you'd go down like that? Is it bad? Fucking Tanya. Tanya? Gord's girlfriend. Cool.

Yeah. I'm great. I'm, um... Work is really good. Insurance, right? Yeah, and that's, um, thrilling. I love living in Toronto. It's, like, the best thing I ever did. And are you still working at brakes and, um... Working at Desi's? Yeah. I meant how are you doing about your mom? Oh. Yeah. Okay. We don't need to talk about it. That's not why I'm crying. We don't need to talk about that, either. Yeah, what's there even to say? Well, I never thought I'd see you again. I don't even know why I... You know what she's like. It's impossible... She was impossible? I know. I did it, I shouldn't have. I used to have nightmares. I would wake up and I wouldn't know anything but I would scream for you. I didn't know you even still thought about me. Oh, come on! I hope no one ever has to think about anything as much as I think about you. How is he? She won't tell me anything. I don't know. Shit. Thanks for putting some stuff away. I didn't know if you were coming back. I wasn't going to run away with the van. I wasn't worried about the van. I got punched. So, Mom's going to be on the cover of The Star tomorrow. Really? Don't worry. I didn't say anything crazy to the reporter. I promise. It's just... Well, everybody's going to know now. I think everyone already knows. Do you think Dad's seen it? Of course. He can't fucking call us, though. No. Do you remember that look he would get on his face? Like, that bewildered look like, "Well, I tried everything, and she's still so unhappy." Like she's fucking math, like she made any sense at all. Do I have that look on my face now? I saw Gord. That who punched you? It was his girlfriend. Oh. There's some leftover spaghetti In the fridge. Is she pretty? Um... Yes. Nicki, did Mom ever talk to you about wanting to... Are you asking me if Mom tried to kill herself? Why else would she do something like this? It's mom. She's fucking crazy. She does crazy shit all the time. Well, I talked to a nurse in the hospital. She said that they could give her the meds there, and I think maybe that that would be better. She was the same as she ever was. You can't keep saying that she was the same as she ever was. Nicki, what do you want me to do if Mom's brain damaged? I can't take care of her if she's a fucking vegetable. Okay. Put something on your wrist. It looks really fucking bad. It doesn't seem to be helping your anxiety. I'm fine. Be careful or you're going to end up where she is. Slowly, and hold us all hostage like she did. And, yeah. Meds or not. It was her fucking swan song. So, my mom's, like, in a coma. She's on the news, which was pretty cool. I just... I freaked out earlier because I'm, like, I'm pretty drunk. So, do you want me to fuck you or can you blow me? Oh. Whatever. Actually. I can't. Off. I can't. Okay. I have a boyfriend. You do? Yeah. He's older. He's famous. Fuck off. He is. He's on TV. Do you know Adam Pelley? No? Okay, well, he's really cool. He's, like, an activist. With your activist boyfriend. Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! I'm doing a bird call. Cool. Do you want to play? Um... I'm not feeling my best right now. So, maybe later? You look bad. How bad? Don't look. Hi. Um, I heard you got punched at Barkley's last night. Word gets around. I'm hung, too. These are not for child. You read The Star? Yeah. Did you? Yeah. It's getting up voted on Reddit like crazy. Oh, um... Oh, my God. Fuck! - Do you want to talk about it? - No! Um... Paris, I know that this must be a very hard time for you... ...but Mom's safe now, okay? And... You can just say it. What? Mom tried to kill herself. Well, she did. Mom knows it's horrendous here. She tried to leave, but then she got knocked up young and got stuck with you two. - I don't... - Don't lie to me. I'm not that much younger than you even though Mom only had me to keep Dad. I don't think that's what happened. Are you just going to pretend to me like you don't know why Mom just fucking... Okay, Paris. Paris. Stop. Stop. You and Dad dipped. And Nicki is brutal. I bet she had Berlin on a fucking pool table. I thought you got it. You left. Years ago you left, just like Dad did. I didn't leave like Dad did. Oh, right, because Nicki fucked your boyfriend. Mom talks about it all the time. Remember? Gord was your boyfriend, and now he's Berlin's dad, and we all pretend that it's not... Paris, you're not the first 17-year old girl who thinks she's fucking smarter than everybody, okay? You're lucky, because when you were young, the meds were working, and mom was not fucking crazy, like she was with Nicki and I. Promise me you won't leave. What? Promise me that when Mom wakes up you won't just leave again. Paris, Mom might not wake up, and if she does, she might not be the same. So, I just... I think it's good that you and I have a talk about all the possibilities. If you pull the plug on Mom, I will never fucking forgive you. No, Paris! Phone! Hello? Oh, Finn. You're home. Of course I'm home. Where are you? I'm, um... I'm, like, three hours away. I had to get more bleach for my ombre, so I'm, like, by the border. Why did you drive three hours for bleach? Is Paris home? Yeah. She's upset about Mom. Kay. Can you look after Berlin? Look after Berlin? Yes, can you just make sure that he doesn't eat anything weird or fall in the toilet? Fall in the toilet? Oh, Jesus Christ, Finn! Can you stop repeating everything I say? Just please look after Berlin? He's probably playing Legos. Uh... Yeah, okay. Bye. Hi. What are you doing? Building. How long have you been working on this? Why are you talking to me? What do you mean? You never talk to me. You just talk to Paris. Like this morning, you didn't want to play. Oh, I... Um, I just... I wasn't feeling very well. Mom says it's because of my Dad. She says you don't like me because of him. That's not true. Of course I like you. Have you ever met your dad? No. Mom says that he lives far away and he's a bad word, and I'm not allowed to say it. Just so you know, that's not entirely true. He's a nice person. And, um... He makes things, just like you do. What does he make? Okay, um... Well... He could make anything in the kitchen. It was always so good. It didn't matter what the ingredients were. Um, he... He was funny. And, uh... He was intense. He could really focus. What does that mean? He knew how to make people feel special. Can't wait to see you, Daddy. Fuck. Hello? No. She's not here. Um... One sec. Nicki! Yeah, no. She's not here, either. She is? You don't want to do this. Trust me. He looks exactly how Gord and my kid would've looked. Does Nicki know about this? I need to see him again. He hasn't been by today. He got pretty drunk last night after you left. Where can I find him? Alyssa, please. I need to see him again. Mom. I missed you. Hi, Lydia. I'm Paris. Ah, yes. Hi, Paris. I thought I smelled you when I was sleeping. I'm saving you. Mom. Jesus, you're the twin. I'm Finn. How's your nose? It looks fine. It hurts. I like your shirt. Would you like something to drink? Just maybe some water? He was thirsty. Gave him something to drink on the way here. Why are you here with him? My name is Berlin. Don't you think it's time that Gord took some responsibility? No, Gord would be a terrible father. I had a terrible father. I'm fine! He has no money. His family does. Or did he finally manage to piss off Frank and Rochelle enough to cut him off? So, that's why you're here? No, I'm here because I want Berlin to meet his father. Don't you think his mother should decide that? That's not why you're here. You just want... Okay. I'm here because I want him to suffer. It's okay. None of this has anything to do with you. Of course it has to do with me. It's my family. Where is he? He's with Nicki. It just hurts. I think I slept on it funny. I'm sure it's fine. I'm telling you I slept on my sack funny and now it hurts. Maybe I should go visit your mom at the hospital. Pay my respects, and get my sack checked out. Oh, Jesus Christ, Gord. She's in a coma, she's not dead. Can you please not go from talking about your dick to talking about my mother? Right. Wrong choice of words. I love that lipstick on you. Looks amazing. You only like it 'cause it makes me look more like her. God, I gotta go pick him up. What's he like? My Berlin. You don't have a Berlin. There's no Berlin, as far as you're concerned. He's a kid, Gord. You have to love him all the time. Not just when you feel like it. I saw her, you know. Finn. Yeah, I know. Do you think I didn't know? Of course I fucking know. She's making me fucking crazy. Finn? No. My mom. First she's making me crazy in the house, now she's making me crazy in her fucking coma. You remember the day your mom came home in the cop car and they found her in a ball gown on the beach? And now... I just thought if she actually... did it, that everything would be different. Things could be different if you want them to. Not if I'm still looking after her. You just have to be different. How do you do that, Gordon? How do you be different? How do you change? Like, in real, practical terms? I don't know how. Maybe you just leave. No, that is what fucking cowards do. My Dad, Finn, now my fucking Mom. Wait. Wait. What are you doing? Oh, fuck. Mom? Ma'am. Wait. Don't touch me. She's gone. Oh, my God. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. No! She's not dead. She's gone. Like disappeared, gone. Berlin. Berlin, baby. Did you bring him here? Okay. Where is she? What happened? There was only about twenty minutes between the last time someone checked on her and when Finn and Berlin got here and found her missing. The hospital is looking into it. The hospital is looking into it? You just lost a fucking coma patient, they should be doing a lot more than looking into it. Grandma's gone? Are you in the habit of losing coma patients? Um... My sister wants to know what the protocol is when a coma patient goes missing. I need to ask my boss? Can you do it this fucking century? Come here. Finn, stop staring at me. You look fucking deranged. Well, at least they didn't find her naked by the highway like the orderly said most hospital escapees are found. Come on. Get in. Where the fuck is Paris? Is that her fucking juul? Mom! Are you okay? Of course, darling. It's just my arthritis. It's okay, Mom. I guess I knew we'd be staying somewhere with a pool. That's your bag from the hospital, remember? They had to change your swimsuit when you got there. Oh. Well, then. I'm just going to go for a walk. If that's okay. I just... I'm going to meet a friend. Of course, darling. But promise you'll come back, okay? I have a fun plan for us. Will you promise to come back? Yeah. Okay. Paris still isn't picking up her phone and I've called her, like, fifty times. Did she talk to you about wanting to go anywhere? No, and none of this would have happened if you'd stayed and watched her like I asked you to. No wonder she did something like this! She's bored out of her fucking mind here. And she's going to do something drastic, like get knocked up. Oh, she's going to do something drastic, Finn? Oh, I don't know, Nicki? What drastic thing are you doing? No, no. Seriously. Tell me, Nicki. I'm your sister. I want you to be happy. So, if you want something, I want it, too. You're a psychopath. What? It's the hospital. They reviewed the security footage and they saw Mom and a teen girl leaving at... Sorry, what? At 9:37. They were in a green Volvo. Ok. Thanks. Bye. Mom's Volvo. She's with an adult family member and she hasn't been missing for twenty-four hours? Are you telling me that there is nothing you can do for my underage sister? What the actual fuck, George? Do you remember the time you paid me to pat your... Nicki, Jesus. I'm sorry. Is there any way you can help us? My younger sister is very passionate and she could have gotten herself into a bad situation. These cops are shit! Pet your own leg, you fucking eunuch! We'll put someone on it. Thank you. Nicki. Excuse me? Is Adam here? He's on a break. Oh, okay. I think he's at the bar. Okay. I think she hangs out with a few of the kids here. Do you know her name? No! I cannot believe that you let Paris get fucked up at Stoner's Corner, and that kids even still go here. Of course they do, Finn. What else do you think there is to do here besides drink and fuck each other? Um. Nicki? No, I'm Finn. Paris is the runaway sister. Dope. Okay, why is Nicki here, too? Paris said you two hated each other. Okay, um, we can't find Paris, and I was wondering if you could help me. Wait, she actually did it? Like, how much, like, meat takes up, you know, it's... - There you go. - Yeah, you know. Hi, baby. Uh... I'm sorry. It's my private time. It's me, Paris. Sharkgirl? Uh, I'm sorry, I... If you have a book, I can sign it. You're joking, right? Oh my God. It's even better than I thought. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. We were just joking. I swear. Nicki! Kay... uh. Sorry. I, uh... So how was the signing this morning? I was thinking we could grab a bite to eat? I was so nervous I couldn't eat. Where are your parents? Um, well, I'm here with my mom, I told you. I was thinking the three of us should go for dinner. She's doing a lot better now. I think she's, like, basically normal. Oh, my God. I cannot believe that she is being catfished by these little bitches. Well, if she thinks she's with the real Adam Pelley, she would go to the real Adam Pelley, and he's in Duluth. How do you know that? I don't know. Paris showed it to me. It was on the news. You did not think to put all this together earlier? She is being scammed by those little cunts and she's got Mom with her and now what the fuck are we going to do? Go to Duluth, Nicki! I have no idea what you're talking about. Do you need help, honey? Excuse me, um, I think this little girl needs to use your phone. Adam. It's me. What's your name? If you tell me your name, I can help you. You're joking. Sorry, sweetheart. Are you even old enough to be in this bar? Ma'am, do you need help? Oh, yes. I'm looking for my daughter. What does she look like? She's 17. Maybe she's at the pool? Would you like a robe? No. What can I get you? I'll have a glass of white wine, please. We have a Pinot Grigio, and a Chardonnay, and a Riesling. Just pour me a glass of whichever you like best. I like the Chardonnay. That sounds good. You have a beautiful smile. Oh, thank you. So do you. Fucking cunt! Get out of my way! How do you sleep at night? Excuse me? You know what I'm talking about. I don't know what you're talking about. Nicki. I saw Tanya again. She told me about Gord. Mom and Paris are missing and you want to talk about fucking Gord? Oh, fuck you. All we're ever talking about is Gord and you know that. You're so goddamn selfish. We were together for six years. He was supposed to be mine. That baby was supposed to be mine. How many times do I have to tell you that I'm sorry? Fuck! Maybe you could help me with something. Mm-hm. If you were a seventeen-year old girl staying in this hotel, where would you go? I guess the roof? Huh. Roof. Yeah. Good place to jump. Oh. My daughter left, after my husband. Funny how you never really see the way things truly are until they disappear. I had already said goodbye to my husband, years before he left. Then all the girls look like him so it's like I'm looking into his eyes all the time. My daughter, I never got say goodbye. I never wanted to. I couldn't bear it. Do you think you can ask someone why they left and get the real answer? Or do they just erase you? Wait, you're that lady from that video? The Conqueror of Kakabeka? I have no idea what you're saying but it sounds good. Kepa... kapa... What do you do when you're a person who's hard to be with? You should have told me you were leaving. I did. You said you were tired. What are you doing up here? Thinking. I messed up. I shouldn't have come here. Don't be silly. I'm having a lovely time. This reminds me of Paris. You went to Paris? Yes. Why didn't you tell me? Why would I tell you? You were there with me, Lydia. Why are you calling me Lydia? Mom. Are you okay? Yes. I'm great. I feel great. How are you feeling, sweetheart? I'm sad. I fell for a big trick. Do you ever just want to run away? No. But people always want to run away from me, my darling. Jesus. Nicki. Nicki! Go straight! Straight! Oh, my God. You are a terrible fucking driver. Stop screaming at me! You get to spend your whole life fucking feeling better than me. Is that good, Finn? Oh, Jesus Christ. You're so fucking dramatic. Get back in the car, I'm having a fucking panic attack. Do you have any idea what it's like to wake up and wonder what fucked up thing Mom is going to do today? To clean her up after she shit herself? To know that Paris now looks at me exactly the same way that you used to? Nicki, give me the keys. We have to find them. No, you know what? Fuck them! Fuck that. So what if I'm fucking Gord? It's the one time I get to think about myself. He might be fucking you, but he still loves me. Nicki, give me your keys and get back in the fucking car! Give me a fucking second. Okay, he loves you so much, why is he fucking me? He's fucking you because we have the same face and I left. That's what you tell yourself, eh? Does that make you feel better for all those times in grade school when you pretended to be me so that boys would like you? I don't tell myself anything. I don't think about either of you. I don't! You act like this is some fucking tragedy that happened to you, Finn. You hated me before I fucked Gord, and you treated Gord like shit. What? You put us together. You didn't like either of us. Do you know how many nights we stayed up late talking after you went to bed and he would just ask me advice on how to get you to love him again? I pitied him because I could feel how stupid and boring I was to you from when we were, like, Paris's age, Do have any idea what that's like? I... You just keep trying to be interesting and smart so that somebody to like you again. Then you fucking come back here and make this all about you. Do you want to know how I felt when I found out that Mom was in the coma? I was fucking relieved. Fucking cunt! I have a plan. I want to take you on a trip. It will be so peaceful. You'll feel so much better. I can do it. I'll pack. I am going to take you away from all of this, okay? I have a plan. We're going to have so much fun. Yeah. It's her. Paris just wanted us to be acceptable, but that was never going to happen. So I did what I had to do. What do you mean, Mom? I want to tell you about a dream I've been having, and it's so strange because in the dream I'm all alone on a summer's night with little breezes blowing around me. And I hear nothing. My hair is long, I feel it on my shoulders. And then I realize I'm naked and I'm standing by the Falls. There's no one around to see me, and I feel so lovely I wouldn't care anyway. I move around a little bit, but I'm very careful not to fall over. And then I look up and I see you dancing in the clouds. You look so beautiful. So, I call, "Paris!" AND I reach up to you, and I force myself to rise up to you so I can be where you're having such a good time, because I want to dance with you, I want to be together with you. And I think... I think maybe the twins are there, too, but just before I get there, I wake up. I always wake up. I don't want to wake up. Let's do it, but not a dream. I need to do it but not a dream. Okay. It's okay. I'll just... Let's just go to the car, okay? Just go to the car and I'll drive. What do you even fucking like about him? God! Get the fuck off of me! I can't fucking do this right now. I can't fucking do this. Okay. You know what I liked about him? I loved everything that you hated. I loved how wild he got, and I loved how fucking stupid was he was, and because he was so stupid he was happy, and he was going to stay here. Oh, fuck off, Nicki! You were going to travel. You were going to go to Europe. Instead, you named your kid after a place you wanted to go, just like Mom did with Paris, and that is so fucking sad. You didn't stay in Thunder Bay because you liked it, you fucking stayed because you got knocked up. It's called taking responsibility, Finn. You call living with Mom taking responsibility? Okay. Fine. I am the fucked up one because I never left. No, no, Nicki. Don't do this. You do not pretend like you didn't choose this. Like you are some fucking martyr. You slept with him for months! You got pregnant when we were still living together. You are still fucking him! Why does everybody fucking forget that? Because he shouldn't have been your boyfriend! Oh, right. Right. He should've been yours. No. Because you deserved better. What? Gord was never going anywhere. You could, Finn, and you did. You're right. I'm not as interesting as you. But you wanted to leave and you did. Did you do it on purpose? With Berlin? Did I take a bullet for you? And by bullet, do I mean the semen of your high school sweetheart? No. I just didn't care one way or another. Why? Because what's the difference? My life was always going to look exactly like this. We have to fucking find them, Finn. I didn't leave because you fucked Gord. I left because Mom told me to. What? She told me I wasn't welcome in her house anymore. She did? She was manic and she was fucking crazy, but she told me to leave, so I did. Why did you never tell me that? Because I hated you. You have to let Berlin see Gord. It's not his fault that we're so fucked. Gord can't be a father. Give him a shot, Nicki. He deserves a shot. It's not his fault we're so... Fucked. I know. We have to fucking find them, Finn. What are we going to do? I don't fucking know. You have to stop drinking. I need to do a lot of things. Oh. Hi. I'm Gord. I know who you are. I just came to see if Finn was home. My girlfriend told me you guys came over to my house. Finn's not home and my sitter's upstairs asleep. My mom's not home either. Okay. I guess I'll go. Yeah. Uh, can you just tell Finn I talked to that reporter, Cassandra, but that I didn't tell her anything? I mean, I didn't really have much to tell her, anyways, but I gave her that picture I had. I figured that Kate would have wanted them to have a nice one of her. You know my Nana? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. She's a nice lady. She's... She's fun. Are you okay? I always used to imagine that she was, like, like a mom to me, you know? Uh... You guys don't know how lucky you are. I don't mean that. You do know, probably. I'll see you later. ♪ I guess I'll just lie here ♪ ♪ Wait to wait ♪ ♪ Thinking of everything ♪ ♪ That could go wrong ♪ Okay, hi. Hi. I'm really sorry! Please just don't say anything. I'm... Mom... and she's... We're at the Falls. What? Paris! Paris! Paris! All done? Some privacy please! Okay. All good. Good. I hate having to pee. Okay. Fuck. Did she say that they're at the Falls? I don't know. I don't know. She fucking cut out. Fuck me! Go to the Falls! I know, Finn. I know! You're going the wrong direction! I know. I know! I know! Jesus Christ. These two are going to be the fucking death of me. It's pretty here. Everything's pretty when you're about to make a change. Mom, do you think he just pretended not to know me because he didn't think I was pretty in person? Oh, baby. Of course not. You are beautiful. Really? Make a change. Trying to stop the pain, trying to remove it all together. It's what took everything away from me. Because you can't stop the pain. You have to be together with it. I think we should call Nik and Finn. They're up there. Give me the phone. Give me the phone. You want to... Okay? Mom! Fuck. I finally got reception again - and she's not picking up! - Fuck. Fuck. My GPS just cut out. It's okay. It's okay. I think I can do it from memory. Just stay on this road. Until the campground sign. Yeah. You're doing great, Nicki. Thank you. Mom. Are you okay? I'm fine. Wish I had something other than these water shoes for my feet. We left your sandals at the hospital. I can't wait to see what you have to show me. You said you have something to show me. Remember? No, Mom. I can't. Ow! No, Mom. No, no. I'm scared. I think we fucked... I think we really fucked up. Don't be silly. You took a chance. This is an adventure! You're going to change the world, my sweet Serafina. We're all going to be together, Finn. I'm not Finn. I'm Paris. I went to Paris once. Mom. Why don't we ever talk about what's wrong with you? What do you mean? Why you're so forgetful all the time? They're coming for us. Mom. Come closer! I want to show you something! No, Mom! Mom, Mom, please! Why am I wearing fucking heels? Do you know where we are? Mom? Do you know where you are? Yes. Isn't it beautiful? Do you remember what happened here? I keep thinking I might, but I don't. Not really. You went to the hospital, remember? Remember? Oh. I remember a little. I can't! Finn. - Just go. I can't. - No, Nicky, come on. Come on, you can do it. Are you talking about the waterfall? No, no, no! I'm talking about what happened after the Falls. I can't. I can't. I can't. Go on ahead. I can't. Take my hand. I'm... I'm scared. I know. Just take a step back. Take my hand. Take a step back. Come on, Mom. I want my dream to happen. - I know! I know, mom. - Of all of us together! Please. Just take a... Take a step back. I'm right here. Do you want to dance? We can dance if you want. We can dance. Do you want to dance? Please, come here. Paris! You are fucking grounded! Mom! No, Mom! Come here. Come here. Mom, Mom! Come here, come here. Come closer. I love you. All my girls are here together. You came. What the fuck? I don't fucking know. This blows. I thought we'd at least get on Ellen. Those YouTube videos have, like, a mill views. Oh, when they ask about mom going over the Falls, say about my salon. Say about my Group on with the password "falls." Nicki, I look fucked. Uh, before the interview, will you guys take a photo? We'd like to get a picture for our website for promo. Oh, fuck me. It's the fucking barrel? Isn't this great? Where did you get that? We don't know where it came from. It just showed up at the studio one day. - You have got to be kidding. - You cannot think that we are actually going to take a picture with... Wait. This could be good. For my Group on. For the photo. Say Kakabeka! Kakabeka. How did you get that? I stole it, okay? I just could not stand the thought of it being here. Let's go. How the fuck was Mom able to carry that? She's a lot stronger than she looks. It's the fucking steroids. So, is this how you pictured coming home? Absolutely not.
