What are you doing here? - Is there some place we can talk? - About what? About your brother and the deep shit he's in. Frank. Would you watch the kids for a minute? - Tell me about Kip. - He took a job and he fumbled it. Now he's jammed up. He's jammed up bad. - What kind of job? - A boost. A big boost. A boost. What's Kip doin' on a boost? Oh, you're shittin' me, man. Kip's become quite the little crew runner since you left. - You don't talk to your ma? - She neglected to mention it. Listen, I need somethin'. I need something cold to drink. I thought we were goin' someplace to talk. - Who was the job for? - A new guy named Raymond Calitri. They call him the Carpenter. He's runnin' all the dark ponies down there now. Like stains on a mattress. And you should know I work for him. There weren't a lot of opportunities for retired car thieves on the gimp. He put me to work. What are you doing, man? Atley Jackson. Right. - They have Kip. - Take me there. Raymond Calitri, Memphis Raines. I try to learn your ways, understand your obsessions.

I need all 50 delivered to Long Beach Harbor, pier 14, by 8am four days from now. I'm paying $200,000. I'm not interested. I'm just here for my brother. The brother of the notorious Memphis Raines. So two weeks ago I hired him and advanced him $10,000. Atley told me. If it's about the advance, I can understand your anger. - I wish it was that easy. - I don't see the complication. I have four days to deliver 50 cars, and I have no cars. - Well, that's another problem. - It is another problem, isn't it? And that's not good. It's a humiliation. Because I'm the arsehole who said I could deliver. Am I an arsehole? Do I look like an arsehole? Yeah. - I need that paper satisfying. - I'm retired. Now, where the hell is my brother? I made this as well. My first one. It takes 80,000 pounds of pressure to crush a car. Kip? - Oh, shit. - You OK? - Shut it off! - Turn it off! You've got 30 seconds to consider your options. Shut it off! I hunt you down, I kill you, I kill your brother Three. You accept the deal, you steal some cars, you make some money and you be a big brother. - Memphis! - 8am, Friday morning.

That was a... that was a long time ago. - What did you put in it? - I don't know. It's good. - Does Mom know about any of this? - No, she doesn't, and... I don't think she should. You know, she works really hard, and... Look, you know, I got everything under control. Kitchen's on fire. Uh... Man! Hey, Memphis. It's good to see you. Haul the cartons over there! - Hey, Fuzzy. - Aw, shit. What are you doing here? - I told you I don't know anything. - Yeah, but you're a liar. - You're gonna get me fired, man. - Fired? That's not good. - You're on parole, right? - Fuzzy. Hey. Nobody wants to get you fired. We just need this information, is all. Two weeks ago, a call came in for a lot of top-end cars. The delivery date. I know the delivery date. - I'm looking for Helen Raines. - Helen, some guy is here for you. Like a firecracker. Like your son. - You look so good. - Thank you, Mom. - I got a spring bouquet. - What are you doing here? Well, Atley Jackson came to see me. He told me something about Kip. Can I help you with one of these? Tell Castlebeck he's not gonna believe who just walked into the Quality Cafe. I can't say I'm surprised. All his life he looked up to you, tried to be you. Guess now he is. So why is this happening? I send you guys money. He lost that... that sweetness. You know? OK. Tell me. How deep in is he? Deep. Can you get him out? It means doing things. Things I told you I'd never do again. - When did you get into town, Raines? - Last night. - Last night? What for? - I thought I'd catch a Lakers game. - Guess not. - Randall, Randall, Randall. Come here. I get this call from this uniform, you know. Axton. Very nice man. Remembers everything. This man calls me up, says, "Guess who's back in town." I say, "Who?" He says, "Randall Raines." I say, "Randall Raines the car thief?" He says, "Yeah." - You guys said a lot. Look, Detective... - No, whoa, whoa. What's really, really ironic about this - And at the time I'm thinking, "This feels like Randall Raines." Now, it didn't have your panache, your flash, And now here you are. Look, I don't know what you boys are looking for, but I just got back. OK? It was a family emergency. Now, that's the truth. I gotta go tell my woman that I just lost $200 on a stupid deal. She can be mean. It's not so... Six years ago you make a real smart move, you know. Oh, yeah, well, without disappointment, you can't appreciate victory. - Eleanor tell you that? - Well, now, that's hittin' below the belt. outside of a crosswalk, if you roll through a stop sign, I mean, I don't care.

I'll be right back. - We can talk right here. - No, no, no, no. It's all right. He's a jackal tearing at the soft belly of our... of our fair town. And he's an asshole to boot, so be careful. - Are you considering a comeback tour? - Do you think it can be done? Don't do this to me, OK? Please. Please. Not now. Oh, man. - How many cars? - 50. - How many days? - Three. How many in your crew? It has to be. They're gonna kill him. Man. It was a mistake to come here. You have a great life now. I don't wanna upset that. Uh, wait a minute. Whoa. Hold on. These days I'm all about second chances. OK. Don't look at me. Look at the people next to you! Turn the wheel! Pull over! Pull it the hell over! - Asshole! - Learn how to drive! Don't touch nothin'. Just... No! You can't negotiate turns, you can't signal properly, Shit, I can't swim. I know I can't.

Let me see that. - Check this out. Check this out! Where did you get this car? In front of some poker parlor in Chinatown.
