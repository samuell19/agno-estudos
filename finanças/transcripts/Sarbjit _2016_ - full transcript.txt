Today is Sunday, madam. And this country's government will change in three days. Until then we can't file a new appeal. This is a conspiracy. You people are ignoring evidence of his innocence. Your anger is justified, madam... - Let that be. Let it be, Abdullah sir. Here's the pardon letter. Ashraf sir has given you an opportunity. If those 27 families sign on your brother's pardon letter... ...then Sarbjit can be pardoned as well. You're leaving in two days, aren't you? You can try this as well. The Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid Delhi, Sayyed Ahmed Bukhari... ...has mentioned in his appeal that... ...Sayyed Ahmed Jalal, requests the people and the President of Pakistan... ...that they view Sarbjifs case through humanitarian view. Madam. Madam... one of them is here to see you. But he's refusing to come inside. He's sitting at the balcony, and waiting for you. His name was Bilal. My brother. He was only 21. I didn't even have his entire body for the burial. God will decide your brother's punishment. Not us. But he's innocent. My brother's innocent. Sister, only the families are innocent...on both the sides. And yet they are the ones punished. Dalbir ma'am! Dalbir ma'am! Dalbir ma'am! Dalbir ma'am! Madam. The new government of Pakistan... ...has put a stay on death penalty. Sister...they've put an indefinite stay. It means Sarbjifs death sentenced has been postponed for now. This means...papa's coming home? Not yet...but he definitely will. - Mother. India's largest city Mumbai was taken at the seize last night. ..by suspected Pakistani terrorists. Crores of innocent citizens were ruthlessly. ..murdered and several are suspected. ..to be still held hostage. Whole world is left in shock. ..as Indian democracy is under attack. No one will. You listen to me. You won't board this stupid bus and go there. This stupid bus will depan today, mother. And anyway...today is Bakar-Eid. This day calls for sacrifices... Go Backl! Go Backl! Go Backl! Go Backl! I'm sure you're filled with anger too. Don't you want to express your anger? Anger is what I've been expressing all these years. Go Backl! Go Backl! Go Backl! Go Backl! Go Backl! Go Backl! Go Backl! Go Backl! Go back! ls this a joke? Only one man. We tolerated so much and gathered here for peace. And this is their answer. Only one man. Go back! Go back! Go back! Go back! Go back! Go back! Whether it's one torch or one hundred thousand All you need is one spark to ignite it. Whether it's love or hatred... ...one hean is enough for it to thrive in . Let it be... Hands which hold guns in them... ...their hearts only desire hatred. Greetings, India. My name's Awais Sheikh. I am a small lawyer from Lahore. Thanks to Allah I've never been associated with guns or bullets yet. I knew no one's coming alongmyet I came here all alone. Because I am sure... ...a single voice raised for peace speaks louder then a thousand voices raised for enmity. I've heard a lot of Sarbjifs case. Don't worry. I'll meet his lawyer. And I promise you... ...he'|| now have a kin in Pakistan. Amidst the sound of bullets and firing, with a message of peace. Ranjifs lawyer, Abdullah Hasan... ...didn't appear for the last three hearings, and... ...he won't this time either. But sir, this is absolutely wrong. This way the appeal will get annulled automatically. And anyway, this is Sarbjifs last chance to freedom. Ranjit! All I am asking for is another date. It's just a date for you, but for him... ...it means some more time to live. Mr. Sheikh, you're not his appointed lawyer... ...nor are you his relative... - Call it a human bond. Unfortunately, these things don't exist in our country anymore. I am rejecting this appeal. But his lawyer has only 48 hours... ...to file one last petition. Thank you. Thank you, sir. If you like to play messiah, then take up some other issue. You can't save this Indian. We tried our best... - The problem is... ...you tried him as an Indian, and not your client. You cou|d've at least been honest to your profession. Then you show your humanity and honesty. Why lust him? There are many other Indian infidels rotting in our jail. Be their messiah. Here you go. Here's some more. And this too. I have some more files. Take them and go. It's from Pakistan. - Pakistan? Hello. - Hello, sister. Awais Sheikh speaking. Remember me. We need to file a new appeal for Sarbjit. We have only 24 hours. So email me the power of attorney as soon as possible. 0K8‘!- ls every1hing okay, aunt? Let's go. I'm saying it again... I cannot allow you to meet that man. We've not received any application from his lawyer. Sir, that lawyer's been terminated. I am his new lawyer. You have papers. - that's what I have come to get signed. We cannot allow you to take any papers inside without coun orders. Get that? Agreed. That means...| can go inside without any papers. Right? This is the death sentence barrack. And this stench is of fear. Come on, walk fast. Half of them have already lost their mind. And the rest live in solitude. Meaning in solitary. Great. You don't give them death... but instead take their life away. Sarbjit. Last time only my family addressed me with this name in here. I am no stranger, brother. My name's Awais Sheikh. And I am your new lawyer. We've very less time. So just trust me. Lawyer? I need your signatures on these. Sit down for a minute. I don't get visitors too often. I promise you, brother...|'|| return soon. And when I do...|'|| bring good news. Take care. Let's come to the point. I heard something about you, sister. If you decide to do something... ...you don't let go until doomsday. Huh? Who? Ranjit Singh.. If Ranjit Singh... committed the crime... ...then he's the one who should be punished. You have all the evidence to prove that he's Sarbjit, but no one believes it. It's clear that no one wants to admit their mistake. No one's trying to find the real Ranjit Singh It belongs to my son. But it'll come in handy to you. Thanks. Introduce your aunt to Mr. Google. Google? I've heard that Google can find anything except for God. Brother. - Yes. Brother, this rogue is hiding right here. Dalbir, I have information about the real culprit, and I can send it to you. He has also been accused of the 1990 bomb blast in Lahore, Pakistan. But Sarbjit Singh is serving sentence. Who is this man posing as Ranjit Singh aka Mumtaj Sarik aka Anmol Singh. A reponerma terrorist or a businessman? He is a double agent. Pakistani Sakil Asad Sheikh has said... ...that he will soon conjure some evidence... ...and on the basis of those evidence, he'll appeal to reopen the case. Please don't... Please stop Awais Sheikh, you must die... Bloody Traitor... He's fighting for an Indian Bloody Traitor...! Awais Sheikh, you must die... Oh this is crazy... how funny to see a lawyer practicing judicial duties... what difference does it make if your client is Guilty or Innocent we should only look at him as an Indian, and he should be punished for that burn this traitor down... How can he forget our 62 year old hatred towards India Burn this traitor down Lets set an example... So that no one ever dares to fight for humanity Awais Sheikh, you must die Humanity, you must die Sir please come with me Sir please let leave You're back. How did you bring it? You've grown up. "| sleep with pains." "For you, they are raindrops." "They are actually my tears." "For you, they are raindrops." "They are actually my tears." "|'m waiting on the path."

But did anything ever happen!!! Nothing will happen! ! They didn't arrest me... I got myself arrested... My well wishers are immune from your curses and proofs... Come, let's go... They gave me back my identity, but not my freedom. They caught him, Ranjit Singhl! What more evidence does your government need... ...for my innocence. Brother, have politicians and government ever admitted to their mistakes... ...that they'll admit now The Indians let him free in just four days. If they had arrested him here, I would've... Anyway...we won't give up. The Courage's left me instead. All I have now is my stubbornness. I am stubborn too. No matter how high the destination is... ...the path's always under our feet only. Mr. Sheikh...do you believe in fate? These fate lines are very stubborn. You can clench them... but never control them. Fate is for everyone Even for those who don't have arms. Listen, remember Sukhbir. From barrack no.11. He's become Salman now. He comes out in open air five times a day. To pray- And I've heard that he'll be set free on next Eid. If you want, I can... May my God also bless him too. I just got my identity back. Now I won't give it back. Myself... Sarbjit Singh Atwal. Son of... Sulakkhan Singh Atwal. Vi||age...Bhikhiwind. India.

Come with me. - Sir... I'll show Father all my wedding pictures. - Yes. Come. Brother, did you get the job done? I could get only one visa. - One? God knows what I had to go through for your visa alone. I tried my best for the rest, but unfonunately. They are joking with us. Unbelievable. Just because India passed the verdict on Ajmal Kasab... ...we've to face the consequences. But how can I go alone? What Will I tell Sarbjit? They are his wife and children? They have a right to meet him. - Let it be, sister. Please sister, his wife and kids have only lived off hope till now. When have they got the chance practice their rights. - No, no. You'll get your rights soon. And I promise... I'll bring Sarbjit here soon. You just see. - See what? Eyes have no life left, they've become rocks. Now its only both of you.

Your country is giving death sentence to our people... ...and you've come here to get Sarbjit acquitted. No... Please lets all stop pointing fingers... Life is too shon to waste. After that... we'll all be reduced to dust. Wow, Dalbir. Does RAW train their agents in poetry as well? Common people like us cou|d've never said something like this. Why do both our countries only share a relation of doubt? We're connected by land. We're connected by the lush corn fields. When did these rifts crop up in our relations? Why is every Indian an enemy... ...and every Pakistani a terrorist? Be it in anger, but try to embrace us once at least. You'll find a brother, and not a enemy. Sarbjifs your brother.

Answering to everyone's questions. I give a speech...and listen to their claps. I give another speech and people applaud... I give more speeches and people applaud more. This... These newspapers... this news, they're useless. Bunch of joke. I am a joke too. I couldn't do any1hing, brother. I couldn't do anything in all these years. Hey... You Crazy!!! You made me Sarbjit again. My name. Sarbjit. It's soaring all around the world. Free. Sarbjifs sister...wow! Look here. This Pakistani was 11 years old... ...when he separated from his family at Delhi Railway station. He's got paralyses. Yet he's been locked up all these years in Tihar jail. Return him to his mother.

What are you saying? Such a bad joke? Not Sarbjit, its Surjit. Serving sentence in Lakhpath jail for bomb blasts... ...|ndian citizen Sarbjifs release story... ...turned upside down due to sensitive conditions on Babur Abdullans decision. Late night, president Asif Ali Zardari's spokesperson... ...Farat Ullah Babur informed us That Pakishtan will be releasing Surjit Singh and not Sarbjit. Even Surjit Singh was locked up in Pakistan's Lakhpat jail. While clearing the misconceptions on Sarbjifs release, President Zardari said... I think there has been some miscommunication. First of all, this is not about asking for forgiveness. Secondly, Surjit is being released, and not Sarbjit. Aunty. Aunt‘!- Aunty isn't opening the door. Aunty. Aunt‘!- Aunty isn't opening the door. Aunt‘!- Open the door. Aunty! Aunty! Sister... - Aunty. You've become more imponant than us, right? Your battle, your sorrows... they're bigger than us. You even tried to make a sacrifice today. Da|bir's so great. She gave up her life for her brother. Applauds...praises. This sister is a fine example for this world. I am his wife. Even I thought of ending every1hing. Liberate myself from these responsibilities. But...you kept saying, that you'll bring him back home. And I kept listening. But my husband didn't come home. - Sukh. That man who was released todaymwas locked up for 32 years. He was released 21 years after he had served his sentence. Even his family had forgotten all about him. But he's back home now... ...not my husband. I know I made a mistake. But...Sarbjit's issue isn't so big. Why don't you understand? Sarbjifs alive today because it's such a big issue. Today One man was released because of him...tomorrow they'll release more. Only because you didn't make the mistake of keeping quiet. You kept this battle alive. You kept me alive. But remember...| am only breathing. My life comes back with Sarbjit. So don't you dare... Don't you dare step back now. Beware! Brother, file a petition. Sister I hope you understand this is our last chance Then let's put our hean and soul to it. Mr. Ravindra. Sarbjifs family has been on a hunger-strike since four days. Did you come here to give them assurance? Mr. Ravindra, lwant to ask... Mr. Ravindra...the entire country's with Sarbjit. Why not the government? I promise you...even the government's with you now. In breaking news. Ajmal Amir Kasab was hanged today. Conditions critical in Pakistan. We must to stop the bloodshed on both the sides. Even we have some criminals... ...whom Pakistan wants released. What if we demand Afzal Guru's freedom in return for Sarbjit? One person who is responsible for the attack at our parliament... We don't want our fathers freedom at the cost of his release... Our beloved country is wonhy of several such fathers sacrifice... International community has condemned the hanging of Afzal Guru. Can't stand Indian democracy. Indians declared Ajmal Kasab as terrorist and hanged him within one year... Then why have we still not hanged Terrorist Sarbjit Singh... Blood should be repaid with blood! That's our Chambail Singh. More infidels will fall. They'll kill one... we'll kill ten Hurry UP- Why don't you do it at home before you leave? You have to get busy anywhere. Sit. Do you have any idea... I've to drop you at school... ...and get to the jail by 9. I won't move until the Indian High Commission doesn't arrive. This is a limit. Man is not safe even in jail. Basheer Basheer. Where are you taking me? Basheer. I've lived my last 23years... with the same hope... That one day Sarbjit will return to his country... And sister has kept this hope alive. I saw it 5 years ago. ‘I've spent so many years in darkness, that I dream even with my eyes open. Today is the day when I am released. Today I will return home... to my people... to my land Then by evening... I console myself again... Tomorrow will be that day... When I'll roam free... Take this... We have succeeded Come on, let's go. Oh Allah... Move back. Move back. I am his lawyer. It's impossible to go inside. Tell him. It's impossible to go inside. The situation is really bad. The Taliban have issued death warrants for all of them. Go back. Go...go back. Please stay back. Please. Aunt‘!- Aunty. - Sister... Go back. Stop it. - Please stay back. Stop it. Stop it! Stop it! Stop this madness. At least let someone be human. Shame on your anger! Shame on your revenge! You talk about justice! You did what you wanted to. You staged an attack on a helpless, unarmed prisoner inside the jail. You call this justice? It's a shame. And now you've issued death warrants for the four of us. Go tell your Taliban... Tell us the place and time. This Sikhni will be there! All you know is to stab in the back. But we Indians never learned to turn our backs! I am right here. If you have the courage, then shoot me now. Do you have the courage? Do you? Come, Sukh. Move! Move! You cannot go inside. Sir, he's my brother too. - Only family member. You saw your brother, didn't you? Leave now, time's up. Come on, let us do our job. Now you'll come back to your country... ...your home. Please come to my house and stay there. We're going to Delhi. We'll request the government... to treat papa at home. Nothings right here. Sister? Do you know, his fingers moved. I saw it myself. But they say coma... He can be treated here too. Please try to understand. Sister. It's fine if you don't want to stay. But don't worry about anything here. There's a death warrant issued in your name. It's best that you leave Pakistan along with your family. This is my country... and I won't run away from here. Think like a father. I promised him... ...he'|| come back home. Bring him back. Bring him back. The images you see on screen... The ambulance you see... Are of Amritsar Airport...
