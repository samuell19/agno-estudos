[foreboding music] - [Doctor] Tell me what you're seeing right now. [sinister music] [girl screams] [man groans] Alice? What are you seeing now, Alice? - Tracy! [girl giggles] Tracy! Don't you ever run away from me like that! Where did you think you were going? - We're going up, huh? - Yeah! [ominous music] - I know. Can I push it? Can I do it? - Sure! - [Man] Hit the top button, honey. - I can't reach it. - Oh, here we go. Ready? Up! Ooh, good work. - And then what? What are you seeing? You have to try and tell me. [man groans] [girl screams] - Please! Please don't hurt my baby! Please, do what ever you want to me, but don't hurt my baby. [girl screams] [girl squeals] - Please try. Try and tell me. - Up! Ooh, good work. Oopsie daisy. Oh! - Do you live on the 13th floor? I didn't think they used 13. - Oh, that was in the old days. We're not superstitious anymore, are we, pumpkin? - No, not me. I'm not superstitious. - You're not? [Alice laughs] - What else do you see, Alice? Tell me. [bell chimes] [ominous music] - Oh, god. Oh, god! Tracy? Tracy? Tracy! Tracy? Oh, Jesus! Oh my god! Tracy! Tracy! [screams] Oh, Tracy! Oh, Tracy. Tracy. [machinery whirring] Tracy? Oh my god. [gasps] [Alice screams] Oh god! [Alice screams] - [Doctor] Try and tell me. - [sighs] Nothing. - Well. [pen scribbles] Fine. That was good. It was very good. You did very well. Mint. And just suck on it, don't chew. Yes, we're proceeding very well. We'll have you out of here in no time. [pensive music] - How much longer do you think she'll be here? - It's really difficult to tell. Maybe a matter of weeks, or it may be a considerably longer period of time. - Maybe somebody else can do a lot more for her, Doctor. She's been here four months. - I understand your frustration. - [Victor] Jesus Christ, look at her. Isn't there something we can do? Give her something? - [Doctor] I have her on a mild sedative. - I want my wife back. Understand me? I... I want my wife back. - Dr. Meltzner? There's a police officer to see you. He's waiting in your office. He's asking about Mrs. Lundgren. - The police? What the hell are they doing here? - Tell them I'll be right there, okay? - Now, I told you nobody, nobody, was to come near my wife but you. Her health's the only thing that matters to me, not the goddamn police. - Mr. Lundgren. Mr. Lundgren! - What? - I agree with you. Now, I will handle this. - Well, then you go handle it. - I will. Please wait for me here. I'll be right back. Please? [pensive music] - God. [Victor sobs] - What do you think you're doing? - I'm Detective Kurt Williams, Ravenwood County Homicide. - You don't look much like a policeman. - Yeah, well, I do a lot of undercover work. Well, what I need from you is an introduction to one of your patients. Alice Lundgren. - Out of the question. - You're not gonna make me get a court order on this, are you, Doctor? - I've already been through this with several members of the police department. Her condition is unstable. I won't allow it. Good afternoon, Officer Williams. - I'll be back. [pensive music] [soft music] - Tracy? Tracy? [suspenseful music] Don't go. Don't leave me, Tra... [Alice whimpers] [sobs] Oh, Tracy. [suspenseful music] - Could you leave us? [pensive music] [haunting music] - So then the cop says, "Lady, do you know how fast you were going?" And I said, "No, the speedometer only goes to 120." [laughs] So what do you do in here at night? Are there any cute patients? Remember Brad? He started for SC? I'm seeing him again. He asked how you were doing. We're going to Palm Springs this weekend. [wistful music] Alice, do I have to have this conversation all by myself? - I gotta get out of here, Kathy. - What? - They're driving me crazy. - Oh, Alice. I'm sure they're gonna let you go home soon. I'm just so glad you've finally realized that- - I want out, Kathy. I want out now. - But Alice, that's not how it works. - I'm a prisoner in here. - You're not a prisoner. You're a patient. Alice, please tell me the truth. Are you still seeing Tracy? - I saw her again two nights ago. - Alice. Tracy is dead. They're not gonna let you go home until you come to terms with reality. I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is. You're not going to be here forever. As soon as you get better they'll let you go home. I promise. [suspenseful music] As soon as you get better, they'll let you go home. Alice. Alice! [haunting music] Now, this will make you feel much better. - Kathy? - Now, this will make you feel much better. Tracy? No. [ominous music] No! Damn! Damn! No! No, it's not real. No. Tracy. Tracy. No. No. No. No. - Alice, I can't let you go home yet. You're not well. You're still delusionary. - Not anymore. I'm fine. I haven't seen Tracy for two weeks now. - When a loved one dies, it is perfectly natural to grieve. Now, you're denying your grief. This is why you keep having these visions. - The visions are over. I know Tracy is dead. I know I won't see her again. - Well. I'm very glad to hear you say that. It's a good sign. But I still think it would be in your best interest for you to stay here with us until we're sure that you've completely recovered. - I am recovered. If you want to keep me here against my will, you need a court order. So either put me in front of a judge or let me go because I want out. - I'll tell you what. I'll be happy to initiate the paperwork as soon as I've consulted with your husband. - It's not his decision, it's mine! I want to see release forms here tomorrow afternoon. - Alice, you don't understand. It's more complicated than that. The forms will take at least a week to process. - Then you have a week, no more. - Charlie, I know we bought the building. Now I want to buy the company. Right. All right, I gotta go. Yeah, Victor here. No, that's good, 90. Sell at 90, right. And don't forget to earmark 50% of the profits for the children's hospital, all right? Great. Yeah, Bev? No, no, put him through. Hello? - Mr. Lundgren? Your wife would like to leave us. She's aware of her rights and is quite insistent. - But I thought she was still having hallucinations. - [Meltzner] Well, she maintains that she no longer is. - [Victor] Really? Well, that's wonderful. - We could keep her here for further observation if you'd- - Oh, no, I don't think that's necessary. If she says she wants to come, then let her come home. That's great. Oh, Doctor? Do me a favor. Give her my love. - [Meltzner] Fine. Thank you. - Right. Thank you. Yeah. - Alice, these are beautiful. "Love, Victor." How nice! So what's with the fitness craze? - I want my body to be in as good shape as my mind when I get out of here. - Oh, you look great. And you sound terrific. So what the hell happened? - What do you mean, "What the hell happened?" - It's just that the last time I was here you were still kind of... You know. - Crazy? Is that what you want to say? - No! - Were you beginning to like the idea of having a crazy sister? - No! Of course not. - Good. Because I'm not crazy. Not anymore. If I ever was. - Good. So, uh... Oh, a cop has come by my place several times asking questions. - [Alice] Really? What'd he want to know? - Well... Of course, anything about the... - It's okay, Kathy. "Murder" is the word you're looking for. - Well, he also wanted to know everything about you, especially about you and Victor. I told him everything is a lot better now that the divorce is on hold. - Why'd you tell him that? - Well, it is, isn't it? Well, just remember, if Kurt comes by to see you, technically speaking, you're still a married woman. - Kurt? - The cop. Kurt Williams. - Cop Kurt, huh? [Alice laughs] - No, that shouldn't be a problem. [knock at door] Come in. Uh, can I call you back? Thank you. Alice. - I'm ready. - I can see. You look great. Sit down. - I prefer to stand. - Well. In that case... Before I sign this, I have to make sure you understand the conditions of the release. - Oh, I know, I know. In two weeks my case will be reviewed by the psychiatric review board, at which time it will be determined whether my release will be permanent or if I have to return for further inpatient therapy. Don't worry, I'm not planning on coming back, Doc. - Good. Well, I guess that's just about it then. I do have a little something for you though. Kind of a going away present. - You're so sentimental. What is it? - Just a mild sedative. In case you start getting to feel edgy. - Peace of mind in a bottle, eh, Doc? - Well, let's call it a little insurance. As much as I've loved having you around here, I really don't want to see you come back. - Agreed. - Well. That's it. - Okay. - We're done. Take care, Alice. Be well. - I will. Can't say it's been a pleasure. [soft music] Tracy? Mommy's coming home. [suspenseful music] - I gotta know everything you know. [wistful music] [soft music] [neon crackles] Hello, Mr. Bear. [Alice sobs] God. [Alice sighs] Oh, Tracy. - "Kabuki killer takes a break." Fat chance, huh, guys? Yeah. Okay, just a little bit. You gotta be up early. [suspenseful music] - [Man] Mrs. Lundgren? - What? Who is that? - Uh, my name's Kurt Williams. Um, detective. Ravenswood County Homicide. - You're a cop? - Some people seem to think so, ma'am. - Do you usually break into people's homes? - Well, no ma'am, but I knocked and the door swing open. I identified myself and called out, but nobody responded, so I figured I'd better take a look. - Okay, you're here. What do you want? - Uh, you want me to turn on the lights? - When I'm ready. - Okay. You mind if I ask you a few questions? Can you tell me anything about the man who attacked you? - Wait a minute. You're the cop who talked to my sister? - Yes ma'am, guilty. - What can I tell you about the bastard? He killed my child. - But he didn't kill you. And that makes you very, very special. - That makes me special? - You're the only person who survived the elevator attacks. It's curious, isn't it? Kind of makes you stop and think. - Just catch the guy, okay? - Listen, do you mind if I turn on the lights in here? - What's the matter, Detective? Afraid of the dark? - Depends on who's in the dark with me. At the time of the attack, your husband and you were separated. And you'd filed for divorce, is that correct? How'd he feel about that? - I don't know, you'll have to ask him. - I've tried asking him. He wouldn't talk to me. Would you consider your husband a jealous man? - Are you suggesting my husband had something to do with these murders? - No, no- - You think my husband could murder our daughter? - I didn't say that, ma'am. - Look at that. Can you see that? That's a picture of a man and his daughter. A daughter he loved more than anything in this world. Tracy was burned alive, for God's sakes. - It's okay. I know you must be in a lot of pain. - Get out of here. I want you out of my house. - If you can just let me explain what I need. - Leave, now! - Okay, I'm leaving. I'm terribly sorry if I upset you in any way, Mrs. Lundgren. Good evening. - Alice? Hey, what are you doing in the dark, farming mushrooms? - Talking to your cop. Didn't you see him? He was just here. - I guess I just missed him. My cop, in the dark? Now, that's a bit kinky. So what did he want from you? - Oh, it was just all these dumb personal questions. I've been through this all before. I'd hoped it was over. I don't know. It's okay. - Well, good! Now I want you to put on some makeup and get ready to go. - Go? Where? - Out to dinner, you nut. We are going to celebrate your new job. Well, actually, your job interview, but with your resume, you're sure to get it. - What are you talking about? What job interview? - At Wexler Burns. The PR firm? I set up an interview for you tomorrow at eight. - Wait a minute, tomorrow? - Yeah. Can we have some wine now? [both laugh] [foreboding music] - What are you... [woman squeals] Let go of me! Help me! [woman screaming] [ominous music] - Whatever, let's just have some dinner, all right? - [Alice] All right, you convinced me. - Great. Now, I know a nice little place right by Victor's condo. Let's see if he'll join us. - No, Kathy. - Alice, he's dying to see you. - No. I mean it. - You're not still planning to go through with this divorce, are you? Not now? - Yes, I am. - But after everything that's happened, how could you? - Nothing has happened to make me change my mind about being married to Victor. - Alice. I don't think you know how lucky you are. Victor really loves you. - I know, but that's not a good enough reason to stay married. I don't love him. Not anymore. - But... He misses Tracy so much. Victor's never lost anything before. If he loses you too it'll just kill him. - Being married to Victor won't bring Tracy back. - It's just that... [soft music] I miss her too. That's why I... I couldn't put away the things in her room. I don't know, I... I tried. But it was... It was worse than the funeral. It was like killing her all over again. I'm sorry. - Shh, shh. It's okay. That's something for me to do. You've been wonderful. Took care of the house. You took care of me. Really. - Alice. Victor has been more help than you know. - I know, Kathy, I know. He means well, but... Look, let's not talk about it anymore, all right? Come on. Let's go out to dinner. - Okay. - [Kurt] They'll never learn. Stupid people. [suspenseful music] - You coming, lady? [Tracy giggles] [man groans] [Alice gasps] [Tracy squeals] - Excuse me. I have this interview this morning in the penthouse, but I can't take the elevator because I have a phobia. - A what? - A phobia. - Phobia? Okay. - Yes, and I was wondering if I could walk up. - Walk up to the penthouse? Lady, that's 13 flights. - Well, I know, but I was... Well, won't you help me, please? - Okay, okay, all right. I'll walk up the stairs with you. - Thank you. [guard sighs] - Here you go, lady. Last stop, penthouse. Ladies' foundations, lingerie, and hosiery. And heart attacks. - Here, thanks. - Oh, thank you. You know, I never climbed all the way up here before, and I'll tell you, ain't never gonna do it again either. - Well, I appreciate it. Thank you. - I'm taking the elevator down. - Hi, I'm Alice Lundgren. I'm here for my interview. - [Receptionist] Please, have a seat. [workers chatting] Would you like some coffee? - Um, sure. Thank you. Kathy? Good news. I start tomorrow. Yeah, I got it. [doorbell rings] Could you hold on a second? Someone's at the door. Actually, I'll call you back, all right? Great, thanks. Bye. Coming! Victor. - Alice. - You're not supposed to be here. - I know, I know, it's just, uh... [sighs] Christ, Alice, I miss you. - Well, that's nice of you to say, but I'm not ready to see you yet. - You sure? I mean, don't you want to invite me in? [laughs] Come on. - Look, I'm sorry. I'm really busy right now. I start a new job tomorrow. - I know. - Oh. Damn you. Damn you, Victor! I don't need your help! - Alice, the first thing the psychiatric review board is gonna look at is whether or not you can hold down a job. - And you don't think I know that? I planned on getting a job, but I could've gotten one on my own, without your help. That's what I need right now, to be on my own. - Well, uh... You're still my wife, you understand that? You're still my goddamn wife and I'm your husband. [suspenseful music] [haunting music] - Excuse me. Excuse me, please. Excuse me! I need to get off. Pardon me! Excuse me! Tracy! Tracy! Tracy! Come here! Tracy, come here! Tracy! Tracy! [Alice screaming] Oh, uh... [guard panting] Thanks again. - Yeah. But listen, just don't make a habit out of it, okay? I got more important things to do. - I'm sure you do. I'll see if I can't get my boss to make me up a key. Thanks. [suspenseful music] Tracy? Hello? Tracy? Tracy? Tracy! Tracy! - Jill. You okay, honey? Do you enjoy frightening little girls? - No, I'm sorry. I thought she... She looked like my little girl. I'm sorry, I made a mistake. - I suppose there's no harm done. [bell chimes] Come on, honey. - Okay, I know we promised you tomorrow. Don't worry. We'll have it by tomorrow. Go over it again line by line and see what you can come up with. - Reporting for duty, Ms. Wilkes. - Oh, please. Call me Midge, everybody does. - Okay, Midge. - Welcome to Wexler Burns, Alice. Glad you could join us. - Thanks. It's nice to be here. - Well, come on. I'll give you the tour. This is the reception area. - Mm-hmm. - This will be your office. - Mm, that's nice. - Mm. Excuse my portable phone, but I feel naked without it. The restrooms are way down at the end. We're doing some construction down there to make way for a new executive row. Come on, let me show you the media room. Here we are. It's state-of-the-art, completely soundproof. We use it for viewing videotapes, client meetings, that kind of thing. - Oh, it's great. I love the artwork. [phone rings] - Excuse me a moment. Sure. - Yes? Hi, Jim. Of course I know how important this is to you. In fact, we've hired a new writer to handle the overflow. Right. Well, I'll have to find that for you. Can you hold on a second? Come on. We're working on a publicity kit for a new horror movie and I told the client we'd have it finished by tomorrow. - Is there anything I can do? - Only about a million things. Listen, take a look at these bios. See if you can condense them to a paragraph each. I'll join you in a bit in your office. - Okay, great. - Jim? Yes, I've got the file right here. - Ah, the joys of employment. [suspenseful music] [workers catcalling] [Alice laughs] Cute, guys. Cute. [suspenseful music] - [Tracy] Mommy, Mommy? Where are you, Mommy? Mommy? - Get ahold of yourself, Alice. She's dead. - [Tracy] Come to me, Mommy. - Tracy? Tracy, are you in there? [yelps] Oh god, you scared me. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you. Are you, uh... You must be the new girl. - Huh? Oh! Yes, I am. I was just looking for the ladies room and... - Oh. Well, this is it here. We've been having so much construction going here lately that we've all been using this. But don't go in here. That's the construction area. Someone keeps changing the signs. As a joke. I think it's one of the secretaries, or the workmen. - Yeah, probably. - But don't worry, this door locks from the inside. - It's okay. I didn't need it now anyway, actually. I just wanted to know where it was. You know, for later. - I... Sure. - Yeah. - Mrs. Lundgren? I still gotta ask you a few questions. - Look, this is my first day at a new job. Can't you just leave me alone, please? - I'm very sorry to disturb you. I really am. I got no choice though. I mean, couldn't we talk over lunch? - I don't think so. I'm very busy. - You gotta eat! I mean, you know, we could eat and we could talk and I could cross my heart that I'm not gonna ask any cop questions and... You know, nothing fancy. [soft music] - [Alice] So. You eat on roofs very often? - Well, as often as I can, yeah. It's a nice way to get away from people, get some peace and quiet. You got a lot of peace and quiet in the hospital, I'll bet. - If you can call being shot up with Thorazine peace and quiet, then yeah, I had peace and quiet, a lot of it. - Why'd you come back to work so quick? I mean, you don't need the money, that's for sure. - I like to write. You sound like my husband. He never wanted me to work. Wanted me to stay home and be his good little girl. - Uh, that maybe have something to do with your filing for divorce? - Partly. - Yeah. What was his response? - I thought you weren't gonna ask any cop questions. - I slipped. I can't help myself. I'm just a naturally nosy person, you know? But, I mean, I care about what you've been going through. I care about you. I care a lot about you. - Thanks. - Well, so now that I've slipped once already and that we're such close friends, could I please just ask one little cop question? - All right, but get it out of your system because the next time I answer questions it's gonna take a lot more than a deli sandwich and a pickle. - In the last year there have been eight killings. Did you know any of these people or was there any connection with the victims at all? - None. - [Kurt] You gonna finish that pickle or what? - Let's see, when does he get in? Okay, good. [Alice and Kurt laughing] - I really gotta get back to work. - Okay. Thank you very much for lunch. - Yeah. Thanks. - Goodbye. - An interesting man. Close friend? - Not really. - Listen, the cassette on that film came in. Take a look and give me a two-page synopsis, say, by five today? - You got it. - Okay. [employees chatting] - Anyone in there? [suspenseful music] [Alice moans] - Hi, Mommy. [Alice gasps] [sighs] What's... [door opens] - Alice? Is everything okay? I mean, are you all right? - No. No, I'm fine. - Hey! - Don't touch that! - Why not? It's mine. - It's yours? - Yes! It was given to me at last year's office Christmas party. I lost it about a week ago, but I didn't think it was in here. I know it's childish to wear a charm bracelet, but honey, I can all use all the luck I can get. You know, you really should lock this door. This is the only restroom in the office right now. Are you sure you're all right? I mean, you look awfully pale to me. - I think it's just a case of the first-day jitters. I'll be fine as soon as I get started, I'm sure of it. In fact, I'm gonna look at that tape right now. - Okay. [pills rattle] [baby crying] [suspenseful music] [girl screams] [baby cries] [baby cries] [killer growls] [girl screaming] [killer roars] [girl moaning] - Oh, that bastard! That bastard! Police department. Get me the police department. Yes, it's an emergency! Hello, I'd like to speak to Detective Williams, please. Kurt? It's Alice Lundgren. Alice Lundgren. What do you mean? What are you talking about? Oh, I see. I'm sorry. I must have the wrong Detective Williams. I was trying to get ahold of Detective Kurt Williams. Homicide. What do you mean? There isn't? Are you sure? No, no, I'm fine. I just must've gotten the name wrong, that's all. No, I'm sorry. Nevermind. - Alice? [haunting music] Oh! Jesus. God, what is happening to me? - [Tracy] Don't cry, Mommy. - No! No, this isn't happening! It's not happening! - [Tracy] Please don't cry. I'll take care of you. [soft music] [Alice laughs] - Oh, honey. Oh, Tracy. Oh, Mommy loves you so much. Don't leave me again. Don't leave me ever. - I didn't want to leave you, Mommy. The angel took me away. I wanted to stay with you. - Oh, honey! Oh, honey! Oh, my baby. - Alice! Open the door! Let us in! Alice! - Come on, honey. - What's the matter, Mommy? Are you sick? - Mrs. Lundgren, let us in! - No, honey, I'm okay. - [Man] Mrs. Lundgren! Are you okay? [pounding at door] [doorknob rattling] - [Midge] Alice, honey, we'll help you. Open the door. - It's locked! Door's locked! Oh! Tracy? Tracy! Tracy! Oh god! No! Tracy! Tracy! Oh god! Tracy! Oh god, how could you? How could you lose her again? - I'll call an ambulance. - [Midge] Good. It's okay, Alice, it's okay. - No it's not okay! He took my baby! He took my baby again! - [Midge] Alice, did you take anything? Are you on something, honey? - It's not my fault. Yes it is. It's all my fault. - Paramedics are on their way. - [Alice] It's all my fault. It's all my fault. - I wonder what happened to her? - Another 25 milligrams of Thorazine. Hit her with it. [Alice screams] Alice? Alice? Alice? Can you hear me? Alice? - Uh-huh? Where am I? - Everything's gonna be okay. - Where's my baby? - Alice! Alice! Listen. Listen, listen, listen. Alice, listen. - Oh, it's you. - That's right. That's right. Leave us. You gave us quite a scare, young lady. - I bet I did. - Want to tell me what happened? - [laughs] Hasn't anyone told you yet? - I'd rather have you tell me. Alice? - I'd rather not. - The paramedics said you were incoherent. Something about your daughter. Alice, have you been seeing Tracy again? Alice? Alice? I'm just trying to help you. Have you? Oh, I'm just so tired. I can hardly think. - All right. I understand. Just rest. I'll come look in on you later. Mr. Lundgren. - Ah, Doctor. - Please sit down. - How is she? - Well, physically she'll be fine. But as you know, healthy people don't hear voices and see their dead children. - So she admitted to seeing Tracy again? - She absolutely insisted she had. - Well, what's this come down to, Doctor? I mean, is she gonna get better or is she gonna get worse? - It's extremely difficult to say. But based on this most recent episode, I'm afraid the psychological review board will insist that we keep her here for further evaluation and treatment. - I understand. - I want to assure you that once again I will personally supervise and make sure she gets the best- - Okay, Doctor, what room's Alice in? - Excuse me? Who are you? - Mr. Lundgren, Detective Williams. - Detective? - He's investigating the elevator killings. - Right. Look, let me make myself clear. Nobody wants the son of a bitch caught more than I do, but I don't think it's a good time to disturb my wife. She's in a very sensitive condition. - Yeah. I'll bet she is. It's awful about her relapse, isn't it? - Yes, it is. - Yes, it is. I just dropped in to see how she's doing. - I've already told you that's- - You want me to get a court order? I'll get a court order. - Court order? You think you've got just cause, then you get the hell outta here and you find your court order. - Real nice to finally meet you, Mr. Lundgren. - Yeah, you bet. - Good afternoon, Detective Williams. - Jesus Christ. Son of a bitch. [pensive music] [Alice panting] [Alice gasps] - Oh god. Oh god! It's okay, Alice. Everyone has nightmares. You're not crazy. - [Kurt] No, you're definitely not crazy. - Who is that? - Sanity is just a state of mind and a point of view. - What the hell are you doing here? - Alice, uh... Listen, trust me. Just for a minute, okay? I think I can help you. And I hope you can help me. - Stay right where you are or I'll push this button and scream rape. I want to know who you really are. - I told you before. My name's Kurt Williams. I'm a police detective and I specialize in homicide. - I called police headquarters. They never heard of you. - Normally I work undercover. I mean, crack scams, bunco chicken markets, stuff like that, and it's pretty nasty stuff. Think you're gonna call division and ask 'em if I'm a cop and they're gonna tell you? - No, I guess not. - Listen, if you want to reach me, day or night, call this number. Okay? I'm kind of obsessed with your case. Let me explain that. When you were attacked, you know, and you get an instinct for this kind of thing, it's... It's hard to explain, but something wasn't right. Something just wasn't right. I mean, I wasn't assigned to your case or anything, but I made you my business. And I gotta be real honest with you right now. After six months, you're nothing but a file folder downtown in an overstuffed cabinet. I think I'm your only shot. - What's different about my case? It was a random attack. - You're alive. That's what makes you special. And I'm convinced that it wasn't the elevator killer that attacked you. - What? - It doesn't fit the profile at all. He never would've murdered your kid. He never would've left you alive. Listen to me. I need information from you. You're the only person left. - You've come to the wrong person. I can't tell you anything. I don't even know what's real anymore. Maybe I am crazy. - Excuse me for asking, okay? Were you taking anything? - Nothing like that, no. - But you were taking something? - The doctor here gave me some Valium that I've been carrying around and, you know, today was the first time I felt like I really needed one. That's all. - How many did you take? - Just two, I think. No, I'm sure. I only took two. - Anything else? Anything at all? - Nope. Nothing. [soft music] Tell me the truth. Do you think I'm crazy? - I wouldn't say you're crazy at all. - You know what I'm asking. I saw my daughter today. I know I did. And I also know she's dead. - Well, it is possible. I mean, that you actually did see her in your mind. It can be very real. - Not in my mind. I saw her. I saw her. - Well, I don't know what to say. Unless you believe in ghosts. - It's wasn't... [knock at door] - Knock, knock. Can I come in? - Kathy? - Alice! You told me you were over this and I believed you. I help you get a job and you flip out. The review board will have no choice but to commit you again and this time for keeps. - Why is everybody so convinced I'm insane? - Because. Sane people don't go around seeing ghosts. That's why. - I didn't see a ghost! I saw Tracy. Alive. - Alice- - I touched her. I held her in my arms, Kat. I felt her heart beating inside her. - No, you didn't. Goddamn it, she's dead! - No, she isn't. [somber music] - Alice. They will put you away. For a long time. Dr. Meltzner won't be able to help you if you won't even help yourself. I don't want to lose you again. - And I don't want to lose Tracy. I saw her. - Then... I don't know what else to say. - [Alice] You don't have to say anything. - Alice. I love you. - I know you do. Take care of yourself. - I will. And I know as long as you're here, Victor will take care of you. [pensive music] [Victor whistles] - You're late. - That for me? - That's for you. So I guess this means you're gonna get out of Dodge, right? - I ain't hanging around here, that's for sure. - I was thinking maybe you'd get a little greedy, come back for a little more and maybe bring the police. - Mr. Lundgren, we had a deal. - Mr. Norton, you had a deal. I got a plan. - Now wait a minute. You don't have to do this, you know. I mean, I wouldn't talk. I mean, you can keep the money. I won't talk. - What are you gonna do, dance for me? - Mr. Lundgren, please, no. - You gonna dance? - Mr. Lundgren- - Why don't you just dance? [Norton screaming] No more hired killers. [chuckles] [phone rings] - Hello? Hello? - [Tracy] Mommy? Are you coming to get me? - Tracy? Where are you, baby? - [Tracy] I'm here. I'm waiting for you. - Yes, but where? Where are you? - [Tracy] At your office. [dial tone hums] Tracy? [suspenseful music] - She's on her way. Just as we discussed. Don't make pointless threats. We both have too much to lose. [suspenseful music] Goddammit! What the... Damn! Dammit! [bell chimes] [elevator hums] [Alice panting] [Alice screams] [tense music] [Alice screams] [Alice whimpering] [suspenseful music] [Alice screams] - [Tracy] Mommy! - Tracy? - Mommy! - Tracy. [haunting music] - [Tracy] I'm waiting for you. - Tracy? Tracy, where are you? - [Tracy] I'm waiting for you. - Yes, baby, but where are you? [line clicks] Tracy? Tracy. - [Tracy] I'm waiting downstairs, in the lobby. - Downstairs. [suspenseful music] [Alice grunts] Tracy! [Alice gasps] [elevator rumbles] [Alice screams] No! No! [Alice screaming] No! Down, dammit! [Alice screaming] [tense music] Tracy? - Mommy! [ominous music] - No! No! Tracy! Tracy! Tracy! - I want Mommy! - Tracy! - Mommy! Mommy, Mommy, come to me. Please come, Mommy. Mommy! Please come. [sinister music] [Alice screaming] [elevator hums] [Alice screaming] Are you okay, Mommy? [haunting music] Hi, Mommy. - Oh, Tracy. Tracy. Oh! Tracy! Oh! [Alice moans] Oh! [Alice moaning] [Alice whimpers] [eerie music] [haunting music] [Alice sobs] [Alice moans] Damn! Damn. It's the pills. Oh, these bitches. Ow! Ooh! [Alice moans] Good. Good. [phone dialing] [phone rings] - This better be good. - Kurt. It's me. - Alice? - You gotta help me! I need you! - Okay, where are you? - The pills. Remember you asked me about the pills? It's the pills. - Uh, okay. Are you still at the hospital? - [Alice] No. I'm here with Tracy. Well, that's wonderful that you guys are together, but where are you? Baby, tell me where you are. - You gotta help me. The man in the mask. The man in the elevator is here. - [Kurt] You gotta tell me where you are. You can trust me. I'm the only one. You gotta tell me where you are though so I can come and get you. [Alice retches] Alice? Alice, you can trust me. - I've been... I've been seeing things. But some of it's true. I know it's true. I know Tracy is here. Tracy is here. I know she is. - Okay. Now listen, just calm down, take a deep breath. Alice, listen, I'm the only one you can trust. Come on, baby, where are you? Alice? Shit! - You were here. I saw you. I saw you! [door creaks] [suspenseful music] - [Tracy] I want my mommy! - Tracy? Dammit, I want my daughter, you bastard! [Alice groans] Tracy! [transformer crackles] Tracy! Where are you, baby? - Hello, Alice. - Victor? - Mommy! - You! Goddamn! - God dammit! Don't! - Mommy! - It's all right, sweetie, it's all right. Mommy's just still a little sick, that's all. - Tracy, come to Mommy. - You stay out of our way. - Daddy, you're hurting me! - Stay out of our way, Alice! - Victor, please, let her go! I'll do whatever you want. - Well, it's up to you, isn't it? Either we live together on my terms or we all die together. [sparks crackling] - Daddy, you're hurting me! - I'll stay, I'll do whatever you want. - And none of this happened, did it? Do you understand? None of it. It's all in your mind. Say it. - All in my mind. - What? - It was all in my mind? - What? - It was all in my mind! - Good. Right. Now. There's not gonna be a divorce? No! - No! No, whatever you want. - [Victor] You're going to go the hospital, yes. Say it. - Yes. - Very good. Tracy's gonna remain with me and then in time, Alice, in time, then you're going to come back to me. And then you'll be mine forever. - Fine. - It's your choice. - My choice. It's my choice. You've already got Tracy. You've taken everything from me, Victor! My child, my... And my mind. - Ah. [laughs] - Jesus, Victor. I saw her die! She was... Oh my god. You burned a child in that oven. - [grunts] This stupid bitch! I got a body, a little body, from the morgue. She was already dead. - All those other women, dead because of you? Because of me? - I had nothing to do with the other killings. You understand? I didn't kill anybody else. All right? - No, Daddy! Don't hurt Mommy! [shelf crashes] - [Victor] Damn you! [Victor groans] - Tracy, come here! Come to Mommy, come here! Come on! [tense music] Come here! - Alice, no. Please. Please don't do this. Please. Come on, baby, I... I love you. I did it because I love you. I love us! I love you. - Love? Don't say that, you son of a bitch! You don't have the right to use the word. Not after what you did to me and my child. - Alice. I did this all because I love you! [Victor shouts] Alice! Alice! Alice! Help me! Alice! Alice! Alice! Alice, please! Alice! Help me! Alice! Alice! [Victor screams] - Come here, Tracy. [suspenseful music] It's okay, baby. It's gonna be all right. Oh, darling. [gasps] Oh! God, you scared me. - Mommy? - It's okay, honey. He's a policeman. - Yeah, it's okay now. It's okay. Where's Lundgren? - He's dead. - It was him, wasn't it? And he was just using the other killings to get to you. - Yeah. How did you know? - I just knew. I just knew. It had to be him. Come on, let's go. [suspenseful music] [sighs] I knew it. That bastard. I mean, how the hell he ever thought I'd let him get away with something like that, I mean... Well, he's stupid. He's a stupid man. There's so much stupidity in this world, you know? God, I hate stupidity. I mean, anybody who'd attack you and your daughter has gotta be brainless. You're good people. I mean, the other people deserve what they got, but you guys, no. No, no, no, no, no. And I mean, it was his fault you went through all this pain. At least you're not my fault. I mean, you know that. But it's a difficult situation because, you know, I mean... The cops are gonna start asking questions and inevitably they're gonna... Be led to me, and I mean, you're not gonna be able to answer the questions. There's no way. You know? A copycat killer, like your husband, is never as good as the original. I mean, this is not something I want to do. Believe me. It's the last thing in the world I want to do. [elevator clanks] You know? But I gotta. And, uh... I'll make it as quick as I can. [Alice yelps] [Tracy screams] - Stop! [screams] [tense music] - Aw, come on. Don't make it hard on yourself. [elevator clanks] [Kurt screams] [Kurt groans] - Tracy, come here! Come here, baby! - Are you okay, Mommy? [Kurt screams] [Kurt groans] Oh, Tracy, come here, baby. Oh! It's okay, darling. Come on, it's okay. Come on. - Mommy, can we go home now? - Yes, darling.
