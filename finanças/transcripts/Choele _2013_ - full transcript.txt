Let's go. Maximilian give it to him! She wants to know if you want to be her boyfriend. In what way? That's right. How old is she? This is a new one. I said you're leaving and I'll have to wear it. - Who says I'm leaving? - You're not? No. When my mother arrives, maybe they'll get it right and we can stay. Will your mother return to your father? You're going. Why not? All right. Never mind. Father. Look! Very good! I said that you could go! This! Very well. What happened? - She died? - Ligo Again? No. Wait a minute. Let him rest. Listen to how beautiful it is. - Will it rain? - No. Do you see that? Are the birds there? Are the birds there? How are you skinny? Do you have too much fun? - With mom? - Yes. Yes. It's a little boring, but we had fun. There is no comparison, right? There's no way to compare. - Toma. - No! Yes. She hid it! How beautiful! Look! Did you get it? - No. She sent it to you. - She? - Yes, she sent it to you! - Seriously? Is she a good girl? It's always been a pleasure. If you say... Listen: "The captain, driven by a furious white whale, was sleeping with clenched fists and, upon awakening, it was no longer strange that his own fingernails were buried to the point that blood flowed from the souls of his hand." Did you see? It was crazy. He was so obsessed with this whale he did not realize that it was painful. It's crazy, is not it? Have you ever read it? How is it? It is very good. I read it at two in the morning. It's fast! Are you Einstein? I will beat you! - You're old. I won. - You ran a red light. I will send a fine for you. Tom. I will charge you. Have you seen Grandpa? How's his leg? He is more or less. It is difficult to walk, he is feeling pain. - Coitado. - What? - Coitado. - Yeah. What's the problem with that? Do some kind of explosions. I have to change the plates. Are you going to cook? - Now I have a cook. - Who? She is a woman who passes. I rented a room to her. And me? I do not know. Maybe we'll get you a place for your grandfather, huh? Then tomorrow you will cook. Sorry. Come in. You cooked? It's very funny! It's not funny, it's an adventure. You are not so small. I already know how to drive. What is this? They are mine. Unfortunately, I was very bored. - Are you finished? - Nearly. When did you start? 3 days. I brought some clothes. I can not lend it to you. It was my godfather who gave it to me. All right. You're beautiful. - What's your name? - Kimey. What does it mean? I dont know. I would have wondered. Shall we? The food is ready. This part was all stretched out. He was stuck between the car and the bottle. - A bottle? - Yes. Between the car and the bottle. After a friend took the monkey and picked it up. - It was lopsided. - Yeah. When he brought the monkey, he put it down and... You're an idiot! You scared me! - Did you wash your hands? - Lavei. - Is everything alright? - He is. - Well, then he became more... - What is it? Is the Pie Queen. This is a recipe from my grandmother. I do not like spinach. Eat. I do not like it. You never tried mine. What is your favorite dish? - Pizza. - Pizza? Next time, I'll do it. - You can do it? - I know how. It's easy. - Mother is very tasty. This is not a father? - It is, yes. She puts a lot of tomato. A lot of tomato. Open your mouth. - I do not want to. - Come on, open! - I do not want to! - Come on! It is small. - No, I'm not a child. - Then open your mouth, sir! Come on! Come on! Proof! If you do not like it, you should not eat it. How are you doing? Not bad, but I do not like it. This is what you have. Leave it. If this is what is ... How long will you be staying? I just got here. And you, how long will you stay? I still do not know. What are you doing? - Nothing. - Your father will kill you. I think not. Do you like his father's girlfriend? What is in your house? - The Kimey? - Yes. It's not his girlfriend. But she's beautiful, you see? Would you not be with her? - No. No... She is not ugly, but ... Not my type. Do you want? All right. - Do you have a light? - Not necessary. Smoking is prohibited here. - Who is she? - I do not know. Why? Because you will break your lungs. - My Lungs? - Yes, your lungs. What is your favorite dish? - Alm?ndegas Puree. - And the spinach pie? That's disgusting! Because you did not taste Kimey's. It's delicious After I'll take you for a taste. All right. Toma. What? - What is it? - This is for energy. - Energy? - Yes. Have you thought about what I asked? What? If you want us to date. Oh, that? No, I did not. Can I answer later? You're strange. - Let's see... - No. I'll be back. - Why? - No. You can not touch anyone. - Why? - You are losing energy. You're strange. I'm walking in the river. I'm hot. I'll see if it will rain. - I like your friend. - Remove to notice. But I would not recommend him to you. Not really. - Why? - He's too old for you. - Does your child want to dance? - I dont know. - You'll make him dance. - Get it! Can you dance, Coco? Folk dance. - What? - Folk dance. Do you know the folk dance? Look... Very good! Coco. - Dance. - This is a piece of cake. Come on, dance! Very good! This was beautiful. It was beautiful. You can join the Cosqu?n Festival. Look. Thanks. And then? Sorry. You can come in! I'm almost done. - This is yours? - It is. - I did not use it. - I did not know it was yours. I do not have the disease. This is my mother's. I can not give it. Why? Because when she comes, she will be angry. It's okay. - What are you looking at? - Nothing. Where are you from? My father was from here. What's his name? He passed away. Excuse me. Some time ago. It's all right. - Have you already shaved? - Sometimes. What happened? Did he have nightmares? A few. Lie down here. - Those are the papers to sign. - It's all right. Okay, I see. - Did you use my perfume? - A little. If you do not want to, you do not need to sign anything. We have to negotiate, no? Of course. Do you remember Las Grutas? It's beautiful. It's beautiful there. You were terrified. I think she's ready to return. I think not. If you talk to her, she will return. You think? She is very homesick. I do not know. It's kinda complicated. I don't know. But she's beautiful. Yes. It is beautiful. - And you? - What? - Do you have a girlfriend? - No. Not really? You need to get one. I have a candidate, but I do not know how to talk to her. You must learn to flirt. You'll teach me? Tell a story. That's a gift, you know? But I do not know any. How? And the raft? More or less. More or less? Look, pretend to be a girl, and I'll flirt you. No, no way! You, pretend you're a girl. Let's see. But it should be... It has to be complicated. This should be difficult. Good? Hello, beautiful! I can not say: "Hello, beautiful." Why not? Linda...Learn. Listen and learn. Hello Noah. What a beautiful day, huh? I do not know. I think it's going to rain. Can I tell you something? If you want to... Did you know that before, there was a ferry that crossed the river? Well, one day, the ferry was carrying a truck And in the truck, there were 7 children. But the driver was half drunk and he did not understand that he had not yet reached the other shore. And then? Pause. The pause is essential. The truck fell, and all the children were drowned. And then, she dies from wanting to hug you. And I hug her? No! Are you out of your mind? No! Wait. Calm down. She approaches. She embraces you. And then, you kiss her. - Do you think this will work? - Of course. Who taught you that? There were years. The ants go down, and the elephants go up. The ants go down, and the elephants go up. Chills. - Do you want me to tell an anecdote? - One...? - An anecdote. - You know the joke? - I know. - So tell me. One day, 7 children, they crossed this river, because they had no bridge. They were in the truck on the ferry, and the driver was drunk. Then... Why are you telling me this? - Why? - Do you want me to keep it? Yesterday I went to the cemetery. The 7 were in a circle. There were fresh flowers. Do you like it? - Do you want it? - I want it. Pure or with ice? It's too strong! - It's good. - Toma. The girl lost the line. She threw kisses to me and she took off her bra. She lost the same line! She's crazy about me. If you are saying... Look. Look. Look. This is your girlfriend. Look. This is... - This is my girlfriend. - It's nothing! You're terrible! This is mine. - Where is this going to go? - I know what's out there. You did well, Coquito! It must be because of this cut. - What cut, it's nothing! It smells. - What? Good. It still smells. - What is this smell? - This is the perfume of my father. It is so strong that you can feel it from afar. - Can you lend me your shirt? - From all. Jeez! Stop it! - Are you going to lend me some money? - Until when? - I don't know. How long can it be? - Until Tomorrow. Okay. How can I? Experimenting with a girl. I'm very confused. - I do not know which one to choose. - You must go to a psychologist. The girls are making you crazy. Hi babe. I have a spare bike. Do you want to go for a ride? Give me a pound... - No, give me the chicken. - A chicken. The one that is there. What else? And 5 sausages. How's it going? Good. You look a little sad. - No. - No? Do you want more? OR Want to know more than that? My friend Maxi needs your advice. What advice do you have? I dont know. About love. What would you like to know? Have you ever been in love? Yes, I fell in love. But... She left me without saying a word. And I was here alone. We do not fall in love every day. No! You can flirt, but not fall in love. I think you are a bit strange. No! I swear! Is it true that Kimey is staying at your house? This. Why? I do not know. I think it's... strange. She's beautiful. Yes, but... Sometimes the beautiful are the worst. You better be careful. Do not fall in love and lose your head. No! Let's stop here? Yes. What else? It's simple. - How much was it? - 30 pesos. - Can you write it down for me? - Of course. Listen to my advice. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - What are we doing? - About what? - With Kimey. - What do you want from me? When mom comes, she will be angry. So what? What about me? I already know! What if we bury ourselves in a cesspool? - Maybe. - It's a good idea, no? Do you like it? Look. Speaking of her... No! Take care! It's for you. Hi, Mom. How are you? The battery is dead. Yeah, Dad and I are having a barbecue. No. He has vegetables, salad, and fruit for dessert. Yes, it's very complete. Wait, I'll ask Dad. Father, Mother can come on Saturday? No! On Saturday, no. On Monday. Is that not what we agreed on? Okay. Talk to her. It can be on Saturday. All right. What time is it? Good. He sent another one for you. Goodbye. Mom sent a kiss to you. A big kiss. - Do you want to go first? - No. Why? So you told your mother. She will arrive on Saturday and will stay until the next weekend. No, no. She will not stay. She will come on Saturday and leave the same day. Mom loves it here. She will stay. How are the boys? How are you? At last! We were with a dry throat! So I came to save you. You see? Yes. - What did you do? - You want it? Like this? Slowly. It? But in the heat. You must put more wood! Why do you not help your father? It seems that he is failing. - It does not bother me. - What? I am hungry! Do not start teasing me. I do not want to make a barbecue. Give me some bread. Do you want bread? You can pick it up. Take a roll. Can I drink? You can. But you're not a smartass. It does not give Humphrey Bogart. And then? My stomach is growling. - Your father will kill us with hunger. - Manda your tummy is waiting. I am hungry! Will it take a long time? On Saturday, you will meet my mother. You will see how beautiful she is. Indeed? - Is she prettier than me? - Our! She's my mother. You're a jerk. And then, is there much more? Why don't you go to the river? I think it's raining there. Raining? You know this? He's driving us out. Did you catch anything? What does your mother do? She paints pictures. of landscapes and life situations. And who does she work for? - With Oprah! - Really? That's cool! After she made the exhibition here, but did not sell anything, poor thing. And who would buy here? Water is a delight. Does she live by that? With what she sells abroad, she can come and live here. It's much more beautiful here. You can not compare. You're beautiful. You are not bad. But this is a little old lady. What? - A little what, you little brat? - It's a lie! A little what, Dimi? - Dimi? Why? - From the "Miniature". - We have the same height! - You are so! You are twice my age, and we have the same height. - I'm not twice as old. - Nearly. A lady never reveals her age. What? A lady never reveals her age. - Do you have a girlfriend? - No. Why? Because flirting and these things are very difficult. - It's not that hard. - For you. It can be... Do you know how to kiss? I'm the champion! You do not know how I kiss! - What do you know? - How come? My father taught me alone. This is true... It's romantic! It's beautiful! But if you ask me, I would like to add one more thing... What else? - As in novels. - In what way? Show me. How... Do you want me to show you? Show me. With the whole mouth. - What? - I do not know. - Were you embarrassed? - Yeah. What my father taught me already serves. I think it's better. You must practice. Is there a bottom here? Did I jump? Anything you can do to save me! It's very shallow! All right? Look at the performance we have. What is she doing? She is beautiful, no? When will you get one like that? I'm looking. Well done, my champion! You are looking for? More or less. - And then? - What? - It's beautiful? - Obviously! Obviously? So it's obvious? Who? - Toma. - Who is it? Call her. What? You do not intend to work? It's almost ready. Only the valve caps are missing and it will work. You will not do anything. There are two tramps. Wait. Wait. Wait. Let's go. -Here, this house... - What is it? Colonel Maldonado lived here. Who was he? He had to keep here, under this room. He came just in time. Then, when they found out that they had found blood and knives. - Down there? - Yes. And the signature. And they found the bodies of adults and children, signed by him. He wrote that he had killed them all. - To help! - You believed? - Let's change the subject. - You were scared! Let's change the subject. You kissed the girl in the river? A little. - Did you touch her breasts? - No. - It was more calm. - Is the style more romantic? - Did you take her by the waist and kiss her? - No? I think she wants me to be her boyfriend. Boyfriend. I have some tips for you. Help me up. Come here. If you want a girl to be your girlfriend, one thing that really helps is to give her chocolate. Good idea! Who taught you? My uncle. He taught me. And where will I get the money for the candy? I can lend it to you. Do not worry. I can ask my father. You will see that this will work. Let's see. And if it does not work? - Who is it? - I do not know. You told her we were here? - Who? - Look. No, I did not say anything. Why don't you talk to her? Make a move and talk to her! What a mess you made with the tomatoes! - Does he know how to do it? - What? Juggling? I know. How good are you at this! Clown. He missed teaching this subject at school. Yes, I will complain. I will ask the director to raise this issue. Do you want me to tell the story? It's about drinking. - The one on the ferry? - Yeah, that one. - I... - what? Speak. One day I went to the river. And I saw a truck under the water. I can hold my breath for a long time, so I went to the bottom and saw the pale faces of 7 children. They looked at me like ghosts. I was not afraid. No, I was horrified! Let's go! Be safe! Look! - Put your hands like this! - What? Put your hands like this! When the wing passes, we must lower ourselves. But it will strike us. Damn it! - Did you see the farm of Dulcinea? - I have seen it. That's where they called me. - What? - To work there. They're going to give me a back room. So. I think I'll accept. And our house? Do you remember the documents? I read them, but I did not understand most of it. It's... Your mother wants to sell the house. She hired an attorney to deal with documents, so we have to sell. - We have to sell the house. - But grandfather. No. We bought it from our grandfather. There are some things that I did not do very well with his mother. Sometimes we make the wrong decisions. Understand? I do not believe that Mom is going to sell. She is sensitive, she cried. And she has reasons to cry, no? It tastes good. What a cook, huh? Can I give you some advice? Do you want to give me some advice? I want to. Why not? So give it to me. You have to get a grip. It is easier. Can you give me 30 pesos? You're a blackmailer! This is blackmail! You learned how to handle very well. Thank you. - When I can, I'll pay. - Do not worry. Not necessary. - Are you sure? - Okay. - Has it? - Okay. Thank you! - You chose? - No, I do not know which one to choose. Question: What will you advise me? I know what's out there. Do you really need to know. - Do you want me to go with you? - No. - Good morning, Lela. - Good morning, Coco. All right? - Yes. - Do you need anything? I want some candy of milk and liquor. - How many sweets? - A box. Good. I'll take it. Coco! She does not like candy? Wait. Coco, wait! She's a bitch. Women are all the same. Do you want to? I want to. She disappointed you. We believe, after, he only gives evil. No way. I'm leaving. She's a bitch. What is the problem with women? They're all miserable! Bye, Choele. Goodbye, girls. It's over. I should have brought candy. I was starving. It was she who wrote. No. What is it? Do you remember the drunk? The drunk driver. - The ferry? - Here. Look at the signature. 7 cards. 7 children. - I have to apologize. - Are you sure? Do not be stupid. - What does she have to do with it? - Are you hurt? - For the children. - Yes. Did you see it raining? Coco! Will you let him go? When his mother finds out he's going to kill me. Do not think about it. - Where do you want me to think? - At home. - At home? - Yes. Every time she accepts, I feel like she's stealing everything from me. And I get nothing. Come on, Dad? Let's go home? Come on. Let's go. League. Come on. Good morning, sleepyhead. - I do not want. - You are going to make you well. Toma. No. Why are you lying to me? Things are not like this. - And how are they? - Look. Your girlfriend ordered for you. I do not have a girlfriend. How are you feeling? Is this your first hangover? Everything hurts. You spoiled the entire bathroom. - I'll clean it up. - I cleaned it. Come on, take some. Toma. A little more. It's horrible. Are you better? You're not so bad. Sometimes not. I've been thinking about the cards. You do not need to send. He did not do it on purpose. It was an accident. Do you think so? I think so. And then? Has he gone mad? Are you more calm? Apologies, Dad. I did not do it on purpose. It's alright. Go and clean the car. - Now? - Now. And then the books. That will do. Today is Saturday? Today is Saturday, yes. Let's go. I like it for you. She's really cool. When Coco was small, he had to work the bladder. He was very small. We said that we would give him 5 toys that he wanted, for him to be courageous. He knew that we had no money. So he chose this. And that was where they put what is on sale. - This must be worth a lot now. - It is. You are a good father. Sometimes I do not know how to do things. You're doing everything right. - What a concentration! - Everything hurts. I saw my mother in the center. - Really? She arrived? - Already. - Where did you see her? - The center. Do you want to walk to the river? I have to finish this. Otherwise I would. Later then. Okay. Then I'll get you. Okay. - Do you know how to tap dance? - I know. Of course. Do you already know how to drive? I know! Coco, get in the car. Come in, come in. - Wait, I have to finish. - After you finish. Come. Let's go! Look, I still have it. What happened? Come. Are you weak? - Goodbye. - Goodbye. She's beautiful! Come on. She is really beautiful! Where are we going, Dad? I'll show you what I was hiding. Do you have a cache? Do you think that I was never a child? I always hide here. Once I had a fight with my father, I came here and stayed for hours. No one found me. Then they started screaming, and I heard it here. Daniel! My grandmother cried. Daniel! Daniel! Daniel! In the end, I had to leave. They gave me a beating. I was all purple. After my grandfather put me in the car and he took me to see the planes. How beautiful! I always wanted to fly, but never got to. Until now. Until now. Answer if you want. Mom will not stay. She is with somebody there. He is a good guy. But my mother needs another person. Do you know what your grandfather told me? - What? - When your mother arrives, he will tell her that Coco will live here in Choele. - With his father. - He said that? It was more or less like that. I like it here. It's quiet. It is, yes. Can we stay a little longer? If you want to, all day.
