There are five laws to create something from nothing. - One. - Distribute being. A single honeybee has a memory of six days, a hive a memory of three months. Two. Accept your errors. Innovation is indistinguishable from failing. - Three. - Inherit the wind. Cause unrest and invite chaos. - Four. - Sacrifice form for function. If it works, it's beautiful. - Five. - Yield increasing returns. To those who have, more will be given. What? - I love your Thanks. Happy birthday. Don't we look alike? My room. Bathroom. And drum roll... Spare room. Your brother is not fond of strangers. You didn't tell me you were adopted. They found me in a basket among the reeds. And Leo? Hm. In a handbag. In Victoria Station. Okay. What else am I gonna learn this week? I took a test. I'm pregnant. It's true. Seriously. Are you serious? Don't do it. Why would you do that? Why would you do that? You f-- Does anyone ever feel the same emotion for a butterfly or a flower that they feel for a cathedral? Or a picture? I know why you're here. Bloodsuckers. But I'm afraid I am to disappoint. Lex? Not this year, no tricks. No hacks, no bugs. What's up? They're not his friends. No, no, no. This year we are the virus. Lex? What do you do, Leo? Live and breathe. I know, I know, call me old-fashioned, but it's good work. If you can get it, of course. I answer questions. I'm an artist. Don't they ask questions, not answer them? - Only the bad ones. - What is it you say, Dru? Art allows us to find ourselves and lose ourselves? It's a quote. I am lost. I am found. Oh, I'm lost again. Hey, smilo. He that is jealous is not in love. Jealous? Don't you mean, "I love you, darling." We grew up together, Dru. We didn't have anyone else. It's been a pleasure. Leo, mate. Come on, Lex. Come on, please don't go. Fuck, fuck, fuck! The pleasure, it was all mine. Wait! Easy. I'm not asking you to leave, okay. You can stay. - But I've, I've had enough. - We've been here one day! You know I haven't seen him in years! Please just, just stay a little bit longer! Please. Daisy sucked too much current and tripped the fuse. Daisy? Yes. The system's fail-secure. If the power cuts, the door stays locked. Good luck. Okay! What's the story? A system reset maybe. Still no signal. What are you doing? - Using Daisy's Internet. - It's ergot. English! Not connected. Security threat. So? What? - We wait. - Wait for what? For me to regain access to the security module. Or until someone drops by. Tea? We can bang on the walls. The neighbors will hear us. We are the only residents these days. You've evicted everyone? Leo? I gave them notice. Excuse her French. You own the whole block? Yeah, us both. We inherited it. Keys. So what? We wait. We'll ration our supplies. She's got a point. If we have to wait for one of your friends to drop by, we could be here for a while. No offense. Mm! A priest, a rabbi, and an imam walk into a bar. The barman looks at them and says, "What is this, some kind of joke?" Wow. Come on. Come on. She talks about you. All the time. Do you remember how we met? You were alone. I asked if you were okay. And what did I say? Not a lot... at first. You were dressed all in black even though it was so hot. I couldn't face it. The funeral. You didn't like your dad. We never really knew him. He was always working, even after we were adopted. After mom died, he worked even harder. We had whatever we wanted. An endless holiday, just the two of us. In that house that was our universe. But everyone grows up. Ow! New category. Characters from fiction with the same initials. Example. Willy Wonka. Rook to C4. Mighty Mouse. Uh... Bishop... to F7. And? Bugs Bunny. The Great Gatsby. Knight to D7. Check. Wait. Checkmate. It's Jay Gatsby, not Great Gatsby, and it's my go. Peter Pan. Peter Parker! Can you not cool her down a wee bit, captain? It's an inanimate object, firstly, and no, I can't. The fans are damaged. You two had an argument? You don't have to answer. Daisy is not hardware. She's a virus. Look. That's new. There are five laws to create something from nothing. D-A-I-S-Y. Daisy. And these are the laws your virus obeys? These laws must be obeyed by anything that wishes to survive. D, distribute being. The whole is worth more than the sum of its parts. A single honeybee has a memory of six days, the hive a memory of three months. And the second law? Accept your errors. Innovation is indistinguishable from failure. To be an error and to be cast out is part of God's design. I? Inherit the wind. Cause unrest and invite chaos. And the S? Sacrifice form for function. Fuck elegance. If it works, it's beautiful. - Y? - Yield increasing returns. Nurture successes. Survival of the fittest. - What's the threat? - She is. Her weakest traits she destroys. Artificial selection. Judge, jury, and executioner. And the defendant. What's the point? Understanding. She's learning to learn. Wait. Leo, Leo! Get it out, get it out! Get it out! Leo! Leo! Oh shit. Shhhh... Well? - I don't know. - Don't know what? What are you asking? I don't know. You don't know what they are? They have nothing to do with you? How's your head? What are we gonna do? When I was a young child, I performed open-heart surgery on the neighbor's cat. While our father was away, I found all the papers, cash, checkbooks, and credit cards, and burned them. This bottle of whiskey that we've all been drinking from is spiked with a very powerful and very rare slow-acting poison. Which of these is true? None of it. Very good. How did you know? The cat was in fact a mouse. Lex burned daddy's papers, with my help naturally, though it was her idea. And no, I'm not checking us all out early, although I did pick this up on my travels, and I did think today was as good a day as any. To family. To family. Do you believe in God? You're asking whether I believe, like Lex, that in another life we'll see our mother again? - Do you? - No. - About which? - None of it. How can you be certain? Let me ask you a question. You're smart. Thank you. You could do anything, yet here you are, playing chess against your own computer. And here you are, a drunk sack of carbon heckling another sack of carbon. Ignore him, Dru. He's a bitter little boy with thoughts too big for his head. Ah. What book did you parrot that from, sis? Do you actually have any friends or just acquaintances you bribe with software? Because the company you keep is so charming. ♪ When all is ending now ♪ ♪ I don't know if I'll ever carry on ♪ What if someone buzzes the door? We mustn't fall asleep. We mustn't. Please. They all have the same texture. Fractal. The same pattern repeated over and over. The surface area to volume ratio must be huge, giving them maximum exposure to the environment. But why? - Where did they come from? - Heightened sensory awareness for increased heat absorption. You look terrible. It's generating its own electricity. The organisms are copied from nature. I say copied. She's borrowed liberally. She's reforming the matter into tissue. The maggots, the insects, that plant. They're part of her. She's harvesting information. No, no, no, no, no! What are you doing! Stop, stop, stop it! What are you doing! - Dru! - Stop it! Leo! Oh, that's my girl. Wait! Lex! Get out the way! Think. Think what it did to you. She's right. It's too dangerous. New recruits were always given buzz cuts at the start of training, initially to prevent the spread of lice. Over time this developed into uniform under the pretext of easy maintenance and cooling. In reality it was another tool in the attempt to depersonalize the individual. Comrades looking into each other's eyes would see themselves reflected back, inspiring empathy with their fellow soldiers. Unity. Allegiance. Worker bees and soldier ants. Long live the queen! Look for signal. We did. Look again. Hey. Whatcha doing? What are you doing? Uh, you're looking for an escape? What's your suggestion? My suggestion? I don't know. I'm just starting to have fun. My headache's gone. I feel cleansed. Oi, Santa! Hey! Seriously? What do you say? Brother-in-law bonding sesh? I'll go easy, I promise. You like games? Cheers. How long have you lived here? - How long? - Years. - So, long enough to-- - Your move. - To know any-- - Any secret passages, wormholes. Yeah, presumably. No phone connection. No Internet. No neighbors. Electronic locking system. Shuttered windows. Checkmate. The shutters, where are the keys? Again. The keys? Left. The white's in your left hand. Micro expressions. Well, macro in your case. The way you held out your hands, your eyes. How can you know this? Because Daisy knows this. Come on, come on, come on. Hello? I'm locked in an apartment on um-- Emergency services have been temporarily suspended in the Greater London Area. In case of a structural fire, evacuate the premises immediately please. Thank you. You've been recording us. You've been recording us. This whole time. Recording? No. I fed Daisy the video as initial stimulus! It's been watching us. - Lex! - What? It's too dangerous. It's not him, all right, it's the computer. So you're on his side now? Listen to me, I think it's gone to his head. Lex! Turn the light off. Stay there. Right, so you can see me here and me on the monitors. Yeah. What, what is this? Their predictions. So what, it can tell the future? She's making very educated guesses based on her observation of our behavior. When I look at myself, the image disappears. Feedback. Seeing yourself in the future influences you in the present. Choice. Try it. What do I have to do? Whatever you want. I know you're in there. Just gonna wait here. Lex? I love you. I uh... don't say that very often.

Or else of thee this I prognosticate. Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date." Shakespeare. Daisy's a big fan. I fed her his completed works for language analysis, along with 20,000 gigabytes of other digitized literature. Notably she categorized Romeo and Juliet with the comedies and recognized homoerotic and Catholic trends in much of his writing. Of course academics have pointed out these connections, but I thought it was-- Not my good side. - Shut up! - Have you prayed for me, sis? That I'll be swept to salvation? Hey, hey, aw! No, no, no, no, no! You're welcome. The airflow must be oxidized by whatever's in that pipe. Plastics tend to be resistant to acid. What? Okay, okay, okay! Easy! Easy! Oh, come on, come on. Coming, coming! Tinkerbell? Lex? Run. Leo! Get out of the way, get out of the way! Get out of the way, move! Three, two, one! Hey. What is this? A trial version. You missed my speech. I gave them out at the party. How many? Say something. It was an experiment. They're Bible verses. They were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of God who had control over these plagues but they refused to repent and glorify Him. Be sure that my words are not false. One who has perfect knowledge is with you. He who is coming will come and will not delay. Lex! What was that? Earthquake? We don't get earthquakes. This place, hitting more than 900 miles away from the nearest tectonic boundary in Britain, - is still susceptible to-- - Not now! What are you doing? An experiment. Change it. There's an unidentified attack that sweeps the nation. Planes remain grounded and hospitals suspend operations after a cyber attack made computer systems paralyzed. A lethal chemical agent have been recovered by the Metropolitan Police on raids on properties across South London in connection to the hacker group known to law enforcement as Sentient. Good evening. Sentient, the group behind the cyber attacks that brought Central UK infrastructure to a standstill was the target of 11 raids carried out by the Metropolitan Police - in the early hours of Monday morning. - What day is it? - Viewers are advised the following contains... - Thursday. - ...disturbing images. - It's been a few days. Armed riot police stake out the Earl Manor Housing Estates in Brixton. The suspects, an alleged co-conspirator in the high-profile security attack that has crippled the country. The young boy, identified as Robert Abel, was pronounced dead at the scene. He's believed to be the victim of a corrosive chemical agent. A third of five suspects were also found dead, while two remain at large. The first is known only to police by their online alter ego, Tinkerbell. Very little is known about the alleged ringleader. The terrorist hacker group Sentient is believed to have breached the firewalls of a number of British organizations, including the National Health Service and the Ministry of Defense. Flights to and from the UK have been suspended as a precautionary measure. The virus has spread to over 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries. The motive is as yet unknown. All-knowing. - All-powerful. - Leo? A deadly pathogen believed to be carried by insects has killed 44 people and left hundreds - in critical condition. - You did this. - Swarms have been... - Cheer up, Dru. At least we're the last to leave the party. Earlier today the Health Service... We don't know too much about the plague at the present time, but we are advising that you develop sensible-- Is this what you wanted? As soon as we have any further information, we'll do a press release. I don't have any further comments at the time, thank you. Tell me about yourself. Do I come here much? All the time. It's like I never leave. Hey, Daisy. What are you thinking? Daisy? Say something. She chose me. What? He would appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who await Him. I'm pregnant. What, what are you saying? - I don't understand. - Come. Pray with me, Dru. We don't have long. Hail Mary, full of grace, our Lord is with thee. - Blessed art thou among women. - Lex. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb. - Lex. - Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God. Pray for us sinners - now in the hour of our death. - This isn't you. - Amen. - This isn't you. - It's not. - It's okay. It's okay. Lex. Lex, Lex. Hey, hey. What's going on? Lex. This'll never do. Look at you. You're a monster. No wonder she's not interested.
