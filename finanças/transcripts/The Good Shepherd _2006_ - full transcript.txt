You are safe here with me. Has a decision been reached on how far this country would be willing to go in helping an anti-Castro uprising or invasion in Cuba? Well, first, I want to say that there will not be, under any conditions, an intervention in Cuba by United States armed forces. And this government will do everything it possibly can, and I think it can meet its responsibilities, to make sure that there are no Americans involved in any actions inside Cuba. Excuse me, sir. Do you have change for a dollar? - Thank you, sir. - You're welcome. From our friends on Wall Street. Miami? Right away. Cardinal is interested. So, the weatherman says Sunday is a perfect day for a trip to the beach. I hope you can still dance, Edward. Couple of days, we'll be doing the cha-cha in El Comandante's bedroom. I'll try to remember to bring my dancing shoes, Richard. Morning, Ray. Mr. Hayes. Miami, and our op center off Guatemala. Pack a bathing suit, Mr. Brocco. We're going for a swim. What do you make of our chances for success? If we get the support that we've been promised, I'd say it's fairly certain. But if there are any doubts, I can still put out the fire. It's gone beyond that. Rocking Chair is still smiling. It's the White House. Everybody's waiting for the good news. Godspeed. When you're back, come up to the mountains. We'll go fishing. Yes, sir. He's been put on notice. In Cuba, sometime before dawn, the invading forces" B-26 bombers give air cover to men landing on the beach. As the sun rises, there is a surprise attack from Castro's air force. The B-26es are shot down. Without air cover, the anti-Castro force's ships are attacked. And the men are cut off from their supplies. The situation looks dire. "Where is the air support?" "Where the hell is the Navy?" "Could you throw something into this vital point in the battle?" "Enemy in Red... Trucks coming from Red Beach" "are right now one kilometer from Blue Beach." "Two thousand militia attacking Blue Beach from east to west." "We need close air support immediately." "Well, I am destroying all my equipment and communications." "I have nothing with which to fight. I am going to the woods." "I cannot wait for you. I am going to the woods." They knew where to find us. There's a stranger in our house, sir. I love you. People who really love each other don't have secrets. You are safe here with me. I love you. People who really love each other don't have secrets. You are safe here with me. You have such a... I love you. People who really love each other don't have secrets. You are safe here with me. The President's saying he's going to break the CIA into a thousand pieces. Somebody on your desk gave away the store. Told the Soviets where to find you at the Bay of Pigs. You got a big problem, very close to home. There's gonna be an extensive house-cleaning on your side of the street. Fucking cigarettes. My ring doesn't even fit me anymore. They didn't get it all. I'm sorry. Be careful. Your name is on a "must worry" list, right at the very top. You forgot your hat. Somebody left a package on my doorstep last night. Have Tech wash them right away. I've been trying to reach you. I haven't been staying at the Embassy compound. I've been doing some outside work. I heard there was a setback. Sometimes the best-laid plans of mice and men... Be very careful. I'll be fine. You worry too much. Just please be careful. Everything's fine. Goodbye, Son. Goodbye, Father. We sail the ocean blue I'm called little Buttercup Dear little Buttercup Though I could never tell why But still I'm called Buttercup Poor little Buttercup Sweet little Buttercup, I I've treacle and toffee I've tea and I've coffee But hark ye, my merry friend, hast ever thought that beneath this gay and frivolous exterior There may lurk a cankerworm? Miss Buttercup. Skull and Bones. Accept or reject? Accept. Not a word to anyone. How does it feel being a woman? Why do you want to know? Gentlemen, I will remind you, you have all taken an oath of secrecy. You have been chosen to become members of America's most secret society. For over 100 years, Skull and Bones members have included a President, Vice Presidents, Supreme Court justices, congressmen and senators, captains of science and industry. The very best of America. I don't think this is for me. You can't take it personally. Getting pissed on is personal, Mr. Russell. I take it very personally. Edward, we're all in this together. Come back inside. We're brothers for life. Tell us, Mr. Wilson, brother to brother, something you've never told anyone before. Your most guarded secret. Something you will need to trust us with. It was the Fourth of July, 1925. I was six. I was playing tag with a friend of mine. Edward, careful. And I tried to get away from him, so I ran up the stairs into my parents' room and I hid in the closet. I looked at my father's clothes, and hanging there was his Admiral's jacket. And then I heard a sound. And I saw my father. And I must have made a noise, because he turned, and came into the closet and opened the door. Have you ever made up a story, Edward? Told your friends something you knew wasn't true, and you know that if they found out, they wouldn't like you anymore? Why? Because you lied to them. Do you understand? And he asked me if I knew what trust was. And I said, "Trust is when you feel safe with someone." Like with my friends. Like with you and Mother. And then he said, "Don't ever lie." "If you lie to your friends, they won't trust you." "And you will have nothing" "and you'll never be safe." He told me to go downstairs and watch the fireworks, because they'd started. And then he shut the door. The sound of the gunshot was very different from the sound of the fireworks. And even at six years old, I knew there was a big, big difference. There was a lot of blood. Father? And in his left hand, he held a note that was sealed. I don't know why, but I took the note and I put it in my pocket. I always said it was an accident. It wasn't an accident. My father killed himself. Congratulations, Mr. Wilson. I'm Richard Hayes, Master of Secrets and Orders. What did the note say? I told you, I never read the note. You didn't read the note? No. My father said your father was going to be appointed Secretary of the Navy until his loyalty was brought under question. We're not gonna have a problem with your loyalty, are we? "And yet, a certain word, a glance, a guise" "Will mirror never show, reflecting not my gaze" "But my uncertain question caught" "inside a shadow of our shifting eyes?" That really is quite elegant, Mr. Wilson. Good order. Very precise. Feeling of the unknown. Fine poetry is the music of mathematics. Numbers singing. You have to look behind the words to understand their meaning. Right. Well, good night, gentlemen. Mr. Wilson? May I see you in my office for a few words? I'm recommending you as editor of our poetry magazine, The Poeticus. I'm honored. Thank you. I appreciate your faith in me. Never be ashamed of your abilities, Edward. Wasn't there a picture that used to sit on the mantel, there? It was a group of soldiers? It's my father's Crimean War regiment. The glass broke. I'm having it mended. I remembered it because it reminded me of my father. He was in the war. I think we're being watched. Being watched? What do you mean? There's a man in a hat. I don't see anybody. You know, there's so much I'd like to share with you, Edward. But I hardly know anything about you at all, apart from you being a particularly bright student. I feel that we have a kind of kindred spirit. I really should be going. Oh, I've started to write something. Perhaps you'd like to hear it. "A bud has burst on the upper bough "The linnet sang in my heart today "I know where the pale green grasses show "By a tiny runnel, off the way" "And the earth is wet" "A cuckoo said in my brain, 'Not yet, not yet'" I haven't finished it. Excuse me. Excuse me. Please. I'm sorry. I can't hear. What's your name? Edward. I'm sorry. Would you say it again? I have to read your lips. Edward. Hello, Edward. I'm Laura. I'm sorry, would you say that again? There isn't one person in a hundred who would walk by a hat on a bench without giving it a second look. That says a lot about you, Mr. Wilson. You don't distract easily. She's a very pretty girl. Sam Murach. I'm with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mind if I walk along with you? I had a chance to have a talk with a fraternity brother of yours. John Russell, the senator's son. John said you might help us. You're friendly with Dr. Fredericks? He's my thesis advisor, if that's what you mean. He's been recruiting faculty members and students to join an organization called the American German Cultural Committee. It's a Nazi front. Has he talked to you about that? I'm a poetry student, Mr. Murach. I'm not political. We'd be very interested in finding out the names of some of the other organizers for the Cultural Committee. Are you asking me to spy on Dr. Fredericks? I'm asking you to be a good citizen. You blow that thing up, it'll be fine. I'll be seeing you. In Poland, Hitler watches German regiments stream across the river San. This was part of the river line which the invading army forced in its flanking drive through southern Poland. The Nazi FÃ¼hrer makes a quick tour in the conquered nation among the soldiers in captured towns. Hitler has given the word of war, and war it is! Poland has been guaranteed... Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great privilege to have with us here tonight Mr. Haupt, the Fuhrer's Education Minister. Mr. Haupt? Good evening. Thank you, Dr. Fredericks and members of the American German Cultural Committee, for giving me the opportunity to come to Yale. Germany has always been a country of... Yes. Interesting. It has been a great pleasure... making new acquaintances... - Excuse me. - Of course. Someone's in here! Are you enjoying yourself, Edward? Very much so. I'd like you to meet Mr. Haupt. You know Dr. Manheim? Yes, we've met. I've been asked by the faculty chairman to relinquish my post here at Yale. Now, you'll hear many reasons for what caused my departure. Suffice it to say I'm leaving with my name intact. Good luck in your endeavors. Now, Edward, what did I do to deserve this? Have you such little regard for me that you'd betray me for my political beliefs? You know and I know Trumbull Stickney wrote that poem in 1902. You were my teacher. You betrayed me. I thought we were going to a party. You want to protect me from them, don't you? No. You think they'll make fun of me. That's not it. That's not true. It's okay. I'm happy to be with you. Would you like to dance? I'm not a very good dancer. That's all right. I'm not a good dancer either. How does this song go? Blue skies Smiling on me Nothing but blue skies Do I see Excuse me, everybody, I have an announcement. I've just been told England and France declared war on Germany. But please continue dancing and enjoying our music. And I'll update you as information comes in. Thank you. Before long, we'll be at war, too. Would you like to get a room for us? Umm... Turn down the light. I can't. I can't. Good night. Good night. Thank you, Edward. For what? For being so nice. In view of the fact we're taking a propaganda lambasting around the world, why is it not useful, sir, for us to explore with you the real facts behind this, or our motivations? There's an old saying that victory has a hundred fathers and defeat is an orphan. And I wouldn't be surprised if information poured in here regarding... Hello, Edward. What are you doing here? There were only a handful of us until moment zero who knew where we were going to land in Cuba. One of us couldn't keep a secret. I know it wasn't me. Mr. Allen asked for the Zapata list of personnel who participated in the operation. I don't have one. Tell Mr. Allen I'll give him the list personally. We're in the same boat together. A leaky boat. Don't ever think we're in the same boat, Mr. Hayes. We're either going to sink or swim together. People like us, we don't let each other drown. I have said as much as I feel can be usefully said by me in regard to the events of the past few days. Further statements, detailed discussions, are not to conceal responsibility, because I'm the responsible officer of the government... Mother, Father. This is Edward Wilson. - Mrs. Russell. - Hello. Senator. Yes. It's a pleasure to finally meet you. Phillip and Toddy Allen. Mr. Allen was President of Bones, Class of '12. Welcome to our little clubhouse. Thank you. Where's Clover? Oh, there she is. I think so. Yes. This is my sister, Clover. - Hello, I'm Edward. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Bonesmen! All here! Reverend Collins will offer grace. Bonesmen first, God second. Dear God, we thank you for guiding the Evans Family Trust in the care of our beloved island, so that we may come here with our families and our friends in comfort and in privacy. He said he was gonna ask me to dance later. Here we go. Don't you dance, Mr. Wilson? Nobody asked me. Ah. Well, I think I'll take my chances. I'm asking. John is very fond of you. And I'm very fond of him. He's talking of going off to fight with the English. My father isn't particularly pleased about it because he's one of the organizers of America First. Wouldn't look very good for an isolationist's son to go off to war, would it? Your brother John is a man of great conviction. I admire him. And what about you, Mr. Wilson? What do you believe in? Are you in school? You don't say very much, do you? When there's something worth saying. Oh! Well. I think I'm going to like you. Mr. Hayes. Gentlemen. General William Sullivan, Mr. Edward Wilson. It's a great honor, sir. I'd get up and shake your hand, but my fucking feet are killing me. Something about too much sugar in my blood and my urine. So when do you boys start your pissing contest? I'll excuse myself. Thank you, Phillip. Why don't you sit down? You understand that whatever we discuss here doesn't leave this room. Of course. We'll eventually get involved in this war. Not because we want to, but because we have to, and we should. And the President has asked me to look into creating a Foreign intelligence Service. And if that happens, I'll be looking for patriotic, honorable, bright young men from the right backgrounds to manage the various departments. In other words, no Jews or Negroes, and very few Catholics, and that's only because I'm a Catholic. You'd be trained and commissioned in the Army and posted overseas. If it's something you're interested in, you have to be ready to leave at a moment's notice. I don't want your answer now. Just think about it. But this isn't a bunch of fraternity boys sitting around playing with their pricks. This is for real. For America. Have fun. And behave yourselves. I'm supposed to be looking for the perfect husband. Are you the perfect husband, Mr. Wilson? Perfect in every way. Then is there some reason that you won't put your arm around me? Day and night Night and day Mmm. You are the one I like this. Very smart. And under the sun hear to me Do you have a problem with women, Mr. Bones? Do you love me? What? Tell me you love me. I love you. Do you love me? I do. I love you. I... I still don't believe you. I love you. Say it. Say it. I love you. I think I love you... Look at me. Look at me! Stop. Stop. Tell me! I love you! I think I love you. As soon as the world comes to its senses, I'm going to travel. London. Paris. Rome. You can come with me. Is everything all right? Fine. We're worlds apart. What do you mean? I feel like I'm just a curiosity to you. That is not... That's not true. I feel like I'm not real to you. That is not true. Edward. That is not how I feel about you. Edward? John. I've been looking everywhere for you. My sister. She's pregnant. I know you'll do what's expected of you. Do you, Edward Bell Wilson, take Margaret Ann Russell to be your lawfully wedded wife? To love, honor and cherish in sickness and in health in good times and in bad times, until death do you part? I do. I now pronounce you man and wife. A man in uniform wants to see you. Excuse me, Mother. Did your mother and I ever tell you where we took our honeymoon? Mr. Edward Wilson? If we could speak alone, sir. Would you like to sit down? No, thank you, sir. General Sullivan sends his regards. He wanted to ask you, sir, if you're still interested in seeing the rest of the world. Yes, I certainly would be. Good afternoon, sir. Thank you. My orders came through. I'll be going overseas. When? In one week. What are you going to do, Edward? Save the world? You are safe here with me. The photograph is particularly dark. As we can see, there is a Caucasian man and a Negro woman. The resolution breaks down pretty quickly. The film stock is definitely Russian, low grade. One of the areas we've been focusing on is the mosquito netting. Mosquito netting is predominantly in Africa, Southeast Asia, any tropical climate. The window curtains here have a distinctive pattern on them of baobab trees, also seen in Africa. Next to the curtains, we can see the building's balustrade. There's a pigeon here. It's kind of hard to make out. Pigeons are mostly found in urban areas, town squares. If you listen closely, you'll hear an airplane. We've washed it out. By the sound of the thrust of the jet engines, we can determine that it's a plane taking off, and more than 1,000 feet off the ground, which would further suggest a large urban area. On this section of the tape, when you clear out background noise, you can hear a female voice. I love you. People who really love each other don't have secrets. You are safe here with me. Assuming we're talking about the same woman, the linguists tell us her accent is French. There's one word here, we can't make it out yet. There's an unidentifiable noise washing her out. It plays throughout the recording at a high frequency, suggesting an air-raid siren of some sort. We're gonna keep playing with it. This is a time for everyone to stand together and hold firm As they are doing. I express my admiration for the exemplary manner in which all the air-raid precaution services of London are being discharged. - May I help you? - Yes. I'm here to see the tailor about a fitting for a new suit. Certainly. And what kind of suit would you be interested in this evening? A tweed or worsted? Perhaps a nice gabardine? Perhaps a worsted and a tweed. Both single-breasted? Yes. Two or three buttons, sir? Three buttons. If you might come this way, please, sir. Please. Our senior tailor will be right with you, sir. Thank you. Welcome to London. You're going to have to learn as quickly and thoroughly as possible the English system of intelligence. The black arts. Particularly counterintelligence. The uses of information, disinformation, and how their use is, ultimately, power. They've agreed to open their operations to us. They can't win the war without us, but they don't really want us here. Intelligence is their mother's milk and they don't like sharing the royal tit with people who don't have titles. Your London tutor is waiting to meet you. This way, sir. Six-five megacycles at one, three, five, nine. Eight point seven-six-five megacycles at one, three, five, nine. Four, two, zero, seven. Standing by. Point seven-six-five megacycles at one, three, five, nine. I should have known better than to use Stickney. Job well done, Mr. Wilson. You blew a two-year operation for me. I told General Sullivan to keep an eye on you. Just as well, really. I was beginning to long for the bone-chilling cold of home. It isn't personal. Mr. Carlson? Is this the American Trade Bureau? Which product? Dry goods. You're late. Yeah. That's what my mother said. Raymond Duca Brocco, born May 8 in 1907, New York City. St. Ignatius High School, Fordham University. Married Anita Delvecchio, two children... Stephanie and David. Six-foot-two, 182 pounds, black hair, brown eyes. Military record, five years Intelligence. Anything you'd like to add? Do you want to look up my ass, too? You're working for me, Sergeant Brocco. I'm working for the United States government, sir. In this office, I am the United States government. You're pretty sure of yourself for somebody who just began. They wouldn't tell me your name. Then how do you know you're not in the wrong place? They said you were a serious SOB that didn't have any sense of humor. There can't be two of you. Are you going to answer it? Depends if I'm working for you or if I'm not. One of your jobs, Sergeant, is answering the telephone. Yes, sir. Use your tradecraft well, particularly the use of black propaganda and the ingredient known as playback. Understanding how effectively your own disinformation is actually working on the enemy. It's almost four. How do you spell syphilis? Is it one "I" or two? Syphilis. One, I think. I never had it. It's vital to penetrate the enemy's intelligence services. Push them into an unreal world, as it were. Doctors in England today announced that medical records taken from Adolf Hitler's personal physician, Dr. Theodor Morell, revealed that Mr. Hitler had contracted syphilis while serving in the German armed forces during World War. The very qualities that make a good intelligence officer, a suspicious mind, a love of complexity and detail, are the very qualities of someone you'll be observing. Good evening, Lord Cooper. I have some information that might be of interest to you. The mental facility to detect conspiracies and betrayal are the same qualities most likely to corrode natural judgment. Everything that seems clear is bent. And everything that seems bent is clear. Trapped in reflections, you must learn to recognize when a lie masquerades as the truth, and then deal with it efficiently, dispassionately. We know you've been passing information to the German High Command. Never give anyone time to think. Now, I'm going to offer you one of two choices. You set the tone of the discussion and quickly come to the point. Either you can be executed for treason, or you can continue to spy for the enemy here and provide them with the information we provide you with. Pass this on to your German friends. And if I find out it wasn't done, there won't be a second chance. You'll quite simply be hanged as a spy. Do we understand each other? How do we know he won't be working for two masters? Precisely. We don't. How do I know If ll can even trust you?? You won't. I mean, I hope you're lucky enough to meet someone you trust. I regret to say I haven't. You must be young Edward. Dr. Fredericks has told me so much about you. - Arch Cummings. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I understand we're of a like mind on many things. Good schoolboys, Yale, Cambridge. Dreamers. They say to be an exceptional intelligence officer, you have to have a steady mind, an unwavering sense of belief in what you're doing, and be a hopeless romantic. American Trade Bureau. It's overseas, a Senator Russell for you. Hello? Yes. Yeah. Yes, I can hear you. Thank you for telling me. Goodbye. We had a boy. Would you mind if we called him Edward? If we called him Edward Junior? I love that. I think it's perfect. Fit for a king. That's what I was thinking. Fit for a king. You like Edward? Aw, I think he likes it. So, how are you? Are you saving the world and keeping us safe? Sometimes. What color are his eyes? Hello? Hello? When he's old enough, you can read it to him. It's a first edition. Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. It was my father's. He would read it to me when I was a boy. Thank you. I had an unfortunate discovery today. A man that works for me, sat just outside my door. I found out he had given a rose to a woman with a small note. The rose was quite lovely, an Abyssinian rose, its stem neatly wrapped in silk paper. All quite beautiful and touching, save for the fact that the paper was filled with secret writing for her German friends detailing changes to the American order of battle here. Excuse me, sir. Thank you. Thank you, sir. How did the Irish poet say it? "A friend for today is tomorrow's heartbreak." Do you know what my deepest fear is? That I will end up friendless. Completely alone. I think you two know each other. Richard. I didn't expect to see you. Hello, Edward. Mr. Hayes has come over to work with us in Special Operations. I hope you don't mind, I've invited him to join our conversation. I'm afraid our dear English teacher has a bad habit of making easy friendships. You know, of course, about his particular sexual tastes. I'm afraid he's not been very discriminating in his partners. Some people are extremely worried about his exposure. I hope you two can help sort this rather delicate matter out for us. This seems to me to be a problem for the British. Why are we involved? The British are a civilized people. They don't eat their own. They have somebody do it for them. So why are you telling me? I'm giving you an opportunity to handle it. Or somebody else will. I'm sorry you've been brought into this. If the headmaster won't listen to reason, you might want to tie your shoe. I'm sorry it has to be this way. It's not something I'm happy about having to be doing. Have you thought at all about maybe going back to teaching again full-time? They're concerned about my personal associations, aren't they? Cambridge boys stick together like glue. I'm far too democratic in my tastes for them. They like pressed trousers and proper buttons. No. I've done all the teaching I intend to do. I am who I am. I'll suffer that. Please. You've given all the service that you can. It's time to retire. The good schoolboy will be close by. He'll want to know my response. I understand if you want to tie your shoe. It's a dirty business, Edward. I've been part of it for far too long. You might want to think about getting yourself a new pair of shoes, Edward. There's a wonderful shop in St. James'. Mr. Pettibone's. He's bootmaker to the King. But then, I suppose we all are in our own way, aren't we? Bootmakers to kings. Get out while you still can. While you still believe. While you still have a soul. Hello. Any of you chaps got a light? I'm sorry. He knew too much. You understand. People who really love each other don't have secrets. You are safe here with me. It appears the word we couldn't make out had its sound wave significantly clipped by whoever made this tape. We restored it by amplifying specific frequencies seen on the oscilloscope. Cochinos is Spanish for "pigs." Let me hear it again. And the siren noise we couldn't pinpoint before were hiding church bells. For some reason, other noises were added to distort the bells. In the makeup table's mirror, you can actually make out the reflection of a church steeple, whose three belfries correspond with the bells you hear. The volume indicates that the church is across the street, again, possibly on a town square. On the nightstand, we can see a clock radio. It reads almost 10:00, which would correspond with the church bells. I also have audio of a ceiling fan. It's a four-blade, standard ceiling fan. We don't know where it's from. There is something here. It could be nothing significant, maybe a candle, a paperweight. Or it may be something personal that we could identify the people in the room with. We're going to wash it again, maybe see what's there. How long until there's some definition as to exactly where we are? We're going as quickly as we can, sir. How are Clover and your little boy? Good, thank you. You know, he's almost five. You made quite a name for yourself in London. The World War is over. The war for the world has just begun. In every liberated country, there will be a battle between us and the Russians for their hearts and minds. Since we dropped the bomb, they're feeling a little short between the legs. The Russians still live in the 19th century. Beets and potatoes. All that will change dramatically. Right now, they're gobbling up territory, taking home every scientist they can steal. In 10 years, they'll have the bomb. We have to get anyone that can be useful to us out of Berlin before they do. Churchill was right. We shouldn't have stopped marching until we reached Moscow. They're from Switzerland. I had them sent with the pouch to Berlin. They're a weakness of mine. When I was a child, my mother would always reward me with a chocolate. It's a dreadful habit. Chocolates or seeking approval? Both. He was an officer in the Abwehr, German Military Intelligence. He says he knows the location of certain Nazi V-2 rocket scientists in hiding. Ask him where he wants to go. He wants to go to Chicago. He has relatives there. Tell him if he provides us with the names and locations of the scientists, I'll arrange an exit visa for him. As soon as he's served his purpose, turn him over to the Nazi catchers. An ex-Waffen-SS Group Commander would like to speak with you about asylum. It's very ugly, isn't it? It isn't meant to be jewelry. I lost the sound in one ear altogether. I can hear with the help of the apparatus out of this ear, but they say in one year or so... You hardly notice it's there. The Russians are interested in making a prisoner swap. We are prepared to offer you some Jewish scientists liberated in the East for some Nazi scientists you have here in Berlin. These are the names we're willing to discuss. I understand your cryptonym for me is Ulysses. Is that for the James Joyce book or the Greek myth? Do you know what our code name is for you? Mother. I took the first hot bath yesterday I've taken in three years, since the siege of Stalingrad. I sat for hours, looking out the window, soaking. When I was a soldier, my fingers were frostbitten. Since then, when I get cold, there is a pain. Maybe you shouldn't live in Russia. We all have our weaknesses. What is yours? I had heard you were silent. "Made of stone," they said. What is the expression? "The silence is deafening." You are going to be a formidable adversary, Mother. I look forward to our association. I hope it lasts for a long time. I love you. People who really love each other don't have secrets. You are safe here with me. We were able to make out the brand of the fan. It's called a Froid. It's Belgian. The object on the nightstand, we're still trying to find out what this is. We just can't get any more definition out of it. Who is this? Who's this? Hello, Father. You have a birthday coming up. I'm going to be five soon. You're a big boy. I'm bigger than Andrew, and he's six. Is your mother there? What? I can't hear you. Is your mother there? She's getting dressed to go out with her friend. He has a new car. He let me drive with him. Hello, Mr. Wilson. This is Edna. Mrs. Wilson is upstairs. She's getting ready for dinner. I'll tell her you're on the phone. I'll call back. Pardon me. Do you need me for anything else? No, thank you. Do you ever eat, Mr. Carlson? I like to cook. Would you like a home-cooked meal? Have you ever read Ovid? Metamorphoses in the original Latin? It's quite beautiful. "I grabbed a pile of dust and, holding it up," "foolishly asked for as many birthdays as the grains of dust." "I forgot to ask that they be years of youth." Bravo. I should be going. Would you like to stay? Would you like me to? I would like you to very much. Maybe we could go somewhere together? The lakes in Bavaria are still beautiful. There was an inn there before the war where they served breakfast in bed all day. Hanna? I hope you never go home. Bavaria is really a beautiful place. I was born there. My grandmother lived there. I really miss her. Why don't we go, hmm? I let a stranger into our house. Mother! Father's here! Mother! Hello, Edward. Hello, Clover. I... I like to be called Margaret now. It's very nice to see you. It's good to see you, too. I made something for you. See? It's a ship. But it's got the flag of England. And then I put a pirate flag there. And if you like, you can count how many sails there are. You want to try that? Fifteen. That's right. Fifteen. No, no, it's yours. I made it for you. If it's all right with you, I thought maybe we could sleep in separate beds for a while, just until we get to know each other again. I made up the spare room. All right. What do you hear from your brother John? I thought you knew. He was killed in Burma, in 1944. You never mentioned it in any of your letters. There wasn't very much to say. Six years is a long time. I was lonely and I was with a man once. He wasn't very interesting. Were you with anyone? It was a mistake. Thank you for the ship you made for me. You're welcome. I'm glad you like it. Mother said you were in the war. Did you fight? Did you kill anybody? No. Good night. Good night. No! You're it! Hello, Father. Hello, Edward. Hello. Hello, dear. There's somebody waiting for you in the den. General. Edward. I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. Your wife kindly helped me to a drink. My feet, they keep cutting off pieces of them. It's not dignified for men to have to die from the feet up. Well, while everybody's been feeling good about themselves, the Soviets, without firing a shot, have taken over half the world. They're breathing down our necks. They'll be in our backyard before you know it. So, I've been telling the President about the need to create a new Foreign Intelligence Service. One that would do in peacetime what OSS did during the war. Phillip Allen will be heading the agency. Richard Hayes will be his exec. And you'll be taking Division C, special operations that report only to the Director. It would be limited to overseas, obviously. Subversive operations, intelligence gathering and analysis. And I'd be interested in your thoughts about this. Particularly in your area of expertise, counterintelligence. I'd be glad to help in any way I can. That's all right. Edward, go outside. Excuse me, sir. Margaret! Come on, Edward. Come. Let's go outside, all right? Daddy's busy. Thank you. I have to tell you, I have some real problems with this whole thing, despite how much we need it. I'm concerned that too much power will end up in the hands of too few. It's always in somebody's best interest to promote enemies, real or imagined. I see this as America's eyes and ears. I don't want it to become its heart and soul. So I told the President, for this to work, there's gonna have to be some kind of civilian oversight. Oversight? How can you have a covert organization if you have people looking over your shoulder? You know who gave Hitler his power? The clerks and the bookkeepers. The civil servants. I have this one weakness. I believe in a just God. I always seem to err on the side of democracy. This must be a nice place to raise a family. I never made the time. I'll be dead in less than a year. I love this country. We all do, sir. We all do. No matter what anyone tells you, there'll be no one you can really trust. I'm afraid when all is said and done, we're all just clerks, too. I was under the impression that Dr. Ibanez supported a democracy. I'm afraid he's changed his mind. The doctor's started to believe his own propaganda. I mean, you dreamed this guy up, Edward, helped get him elected. Those are the Soviets. International Department of Central Committee members Trubnikov, Kushelnikov, who have become overly interested in their natural resources, particularly coffee. Our economic interests are being compromised, to say nothing of the dangers of a Soviet presence so close to home. For security, Edward, we must establish our own presence there. Wait, stop. Can you go back? Go back a little bit. Run it from there. I just thought I saw something. I want you two to put your heads together on this. Michael will be going down there as an agricultural specialist with the Mayan Coffee Company. Non-official. He'll be our eyes and ears. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. - Good luck. - Thank you. I wouldn't wear my class ring down there. Yes, sir. Of course. I want all intelligence on this sent directly to me and no one else. I believe that's what you're looking for. That'll do it. Mr. Wilson? This came for you through the Carlson cover address. There was no card. There's been a potential compromise down south. Ulysses. We can't wait another 24 hours. If you can guarantee that all assets are in place and prepared to move on my order, I'm prepared to move as well. Come back to bed. What were you talking about? It's grown-up talk. I had a nightmare. Everything's fine. Could you stay with me another minute? Try to get some sleep. Yes? We haven't got time to be sure on this. This whole thing hinges on support. If we don't have the support, I can't guarantee the outcome. Can you guarantee the support? That's not a guarantee. That's not an answer. Do what you have to do. These men aren't ideological. Put more in their Christmas stockings, and they'll fall into place. Call the station chief. Get him out of bed. Margaret tells us that you work with the CIA. My wife has a vivid imagination. I'm a trade advisor. A civil servant. - Good night. - Good night. How dare you speak to me that way? You are never to tell anybody what I do. How dare you? Those people are my friends! I don't have a lot of friends! You are never to tell anyone what it is I do. Never. Do you understand me? What you do? What you do? I don't know what you do! You leave at five, you're home at ten, seven days a week. You don't say a damn word to me! I live with a ghost! I don't know what you do! Call back. They're ready. Launch the operation. Say something. - Say something. - I have to go now. Say something! Talk to me! Say something! Look at me. Say something. Remember what I said. Don't touch anything. All right? Merry Christmas, Margaret. Edward. Merry Christmas. Is this young Edward? Would you like to come inside and meet our very special guest this evening? Oh, Santa Claus. - Would you like to meet Santa? - Yeah. Come along. Toddy is wonderful with children. Yes, she is. Come and meet Santa. Would you like a drink, Edward? Thank you. I believe congratulations are in order. The doctor has no more patients. The costs of malpractice. - Gentlemen. - Edward. Phillip. Bill. Gentlemen, you can all be very proud of what you've started. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Bill. - Merry Christmas. Christmas is full of surprises. Do you like surprises under the tree? Well, we'll make sure you have lots of surprises and things like that. Okay? I'm sure Mom and Dad agree that that would be a good idea. Surprises are the best part of Christmas, don't you think? How about games? How about ball games? Can I get you a towel? I'm so sorry. Are you all right? All right. It's all right. Can you take me home, please? - I think we should go home. - Lower your voice. You can use our bath if you'd like. I might have some dry clothes. Thank you. Come with me, Edward. It's all right. Come with me. Can I help you up, Mrs. Wilson? Did you know that Phillip is going to be on the Mayan Coffee Company's board of directors? Remember what I said to you about friends. You look good, Edward. How long has it been? Seven, eight years? A lot of water under the bridge. Carolyn and I, we just bought our first house. And everything's already broken. I spend my weekends fixing things. By the time I get everything fixed, it'll be time to sell the fucking house. Maybe you can give me a heads-up on somebody. You're asking me to give you FBI files on an American citizen? You know I can't do that. It's against the law to spy on citizens. Keep it. Maybe someday you'll change your mind. May I come in? You know, I've never been in your office. How was the fishing? It was a bad year. The water is too high. I understand you wanted to personally give me the Operation Zapata list yourself. There isn't one, is there? You know it was a silent operation. It wasn't silent enough. I've been asked by the President to suggest who we no longer need with us. Who would you recommend, Edward? I serve at the pleasure of the Director, sir. I'm just a gatekeeper. And why is it that people like us choose to serve, for nickels a day, in a profession that makes us constantly look over our shoulder to see who's watching us? When will you make your decision? Decision? I serve at the discretion of the President of the United States. I will do what I think is best for the country. It's important that we find out who's responsible. Good night. At 2242, call received on Berlin base chief's operational line. Man says he's senior officer, KGB. Would not give name. Open up. Thanks. "KGB officer asks when Mr. Edward Wilson is coming." "He wants to know Mr. Edward Wilson's response." Tell him Mr. Edward Wilson is here, and would like to know what he intends to provide us with in return. He says, "In return for safe journey", "he will provide Mr. Wilson with clear understanding "of last three losses in Moscow "and identities of Soviet agents in your country," "penetrations of Moscow station." "He will also speak personally with Mr. Edward Wilson about" "Ulysses. "Things only he knows of Ulysses, "how he thinks, what he plans to do, "and what he wants Mr. Edward Wilson to think he is doing." "To establish bonafides, he will carry with him" "KGB surveillance photographs of all CIA officers in Moscow" "and would be more than happy to take polygraph." Ulysses. Ask him what his weakness is. "The cold." Let's get him over here. My name is Valentin Gregorievich Mironov. My children's names are Anatoly and Sergei. My father played the cello. I play the violin. But you know this. I risk my life to come all the way to tell you this, to confirm what you already know. You failed the polygraph, Mr. Mironov. You know every Russian fails polygraph. Your polygraph doesn't understand the Russian soul. What more do you want? I've given you my bonafides, the names of agents, who has been compromised, who you need to know about. I want to speak to Mr. Edward Wilson. We were told Mironov was with these men the day the photo was taken. Your immediate superior? We're not even sure that any of the circled men are him. I told you this three times already. Sergei Budanov. I want to speak to Mr. Edward Wilson. I would like some tea. There isn't any. I get thirsty when I say too much. You going to keep up this inane questioning for much longer? There's nothing you've told us we don't know, Mr. Mironov. I think you better try a little harder. I didn't come here to deal with children, Mr. Edison. Or is it Mr. Brocco? We do our homework, too. Hello, Mr. Mironov. I'm Mr. Wilson. Hello, Mother. Ulysses is obsessed with you. Night and day, you are always on his mind. He trusts nobody. The only one whom he lets close is his aide, Sasha. He is methodical, he plans things years in advance. For instance, you should know he has developed a friendship with a certain neighbor of yours. Fidel Castro. A young man he has high hopes for. I understand you had a most interesting fish swim your way. Mr. Allen thought it might be possible for me to speak with him. With you as the chaperone, of course. I brought him a little gift I'm sure he'll appreciate. Send Mironov in immediately. It'll be nice to be closely working with you again. I expect you to show me Washington. We can paint the town red together. Valentin Mironov, Arch Cummings. It is a great pleasure to meet you. My pleasure. Now, please sit down. It's nice to have someone like you on our side of the street. I thought you may enjoy this. It's something you might appreciate. I hope you haven't read it. Very clever. Thank you. All Russia is our orchard. The land is great and beautiful. There are many wonderful places in it. Think, Anya. Your grandfather, your great-grandfather... This is a very bad translation. It is much funnier in Russian. And now, doesn't something human look at you from every cherry in the orchard? From every leaf and every stalk? Don't you hear their voices? It's awful. Your orchard is terrible! And when in the evening or at night, when you walk through the orchard and the old bark glows with the dim light and the old cherry trees seem to be dreaming of all that was a hundred, two hundred years ago, and are repressed by their heavy visions. I'm due at a meeting. We've left those 200 years behind us, but so far, we gained nothing at all. We don't yet know what the past is to be to us. We only philosophize. We complain that we are dull, or we drink vodka. For it's so clear that in order to begin to live in the present, we must first redeem the past. Are you Laura? What? Are you Laura? I'm supposed to offer you a ride. Hello, Edward. Hello, Laura. Why all the mystery? Do you have children? I have a boy. Edward Junior. Do you have anybody? A cat. I've often imagined what my life would have been like with you. And what did you imagine? I thought you might teach. Probably poetry. I saw us living in a small college town. You once said to me you were afraid your life was already planned out for you. Are you doing what you want to do? My life has been full of surprises. You owe me a day at the beach. How long do you think you'll be? As long as it takes. I think maybe I'll go ahead. All right. Nothing else is built the same Nothing in the world As the soft and wavy frame... Mother? There was an envelope for you on the desk. You look lovely. Thank you, darling. It's not enough that you ignore me our whole life? - You have to humiliate me? - Margaret, please. - You disgust me! - Calm down, darling. You're disgusting! We'll start from the last. So suppose the dame ain't right Or completely free from flaws Mother forgot some of her things. I'll see you at home. Are you Laura? Yes. I was asked to give you this. In an unprecedented effort to improve U.S.-Soviet ties, Premier Khrushchev began his 10-day tour of the United States today. The visit will start with a tour by President Eisenhower of our nation's capital, followed by a highly anticipated speech at the United Nations. All right, now set it down. Following that, the Soviet Premier will travel across the country to more casual destinations, including America's mighty steel mills, wheat farms, and, yes, Disneyland. President Eisenhower greeted Mr. Khrushchev this morning at Andrews Air Force Base, as they prepare to discuss... It's perfect. The ever-threatening military build-up by the Reds. Our glee club's been chosen to compete in a national competition. Now, back to The Classical Hour. Would you come with me? Would you like me to? Yeah, very much. I'll get your things. It's good to have you home. How was your trip? Smooth as silk. My FBI escort made the trip here very pleasant. Which one is your son? Top row, third from the right. He's a handsome young man. My congratulations. We're particularly concerned about Cuba. Your friend, he's too close to home. You don't appreciate him breathing down your neck. If we continue down this road, there will be a Third World War. I don't think either of us wants a real war. What would we do for a living then? If he keeps calling attention to himself, at some point, we may be forced to send him a surprise. Now, I don't want that to come as a surprise to your people. He is very important to us. We would not like to be surprised. Be well. Be well. I am today announcing my candidacy for the Presidency of the United States. The Presidency is the most powerful office in the free world. Through its leadership can come a more vital life for all of our people. In it are centered the hopes of the globe around us, for freedom and a more secure life. Senator Kennedy, if you don't win the Presidential nomination, will you accept the Vice Presidency? I shall not, under any conditions, be a candidate for Vice President. If I fail in this endeavor, I shall return and serve in the United States Senate. We have a secure circuit with Stockholm station. Station reports they have a colonel, Directorate K, counterintelligence. Do we have a name? May I help you, sir? I'm a colonel with KGB. I'm requesting asylum. What is your name? My name is Valentin Gregorievich Mironov. My name is Valentin Gregorievich Mironov. This other man who says he is Valentin Mironov is not who he pretends to be. All right? His real name is Yuri Modin. "He was Ulysses' right hand. He is Ulysses" mole. Just tell me your real name. It is just Ulysses trying to discredit me. Just tell me your real name. My real name is Valentin Gregorievich Mironov. I was born in Bobruisk in 1924. Attended the State Institute of International Relations. Served for three years in Naval Intelligence. My wife's name is Tamara Markovskaya. My children's names are Anatoly and Sergei. My father is a cellist. I play the violin. All I want is my freedom. Pick him up. You all right? I'm sorry. You see what you made me do? Now just tell me the truth. Because we're going to be here as long as it takes. I already told you the truth. I want to know the truth. You know my name. Tell me your real name. Mister, please, I'm not lying. I'd like to believe you, but I don't believe you. Understand? Now, tell me your name. My name is Mironov. It's Valentin Gregorievich Mironov. - That's your name? - Yeah. That's your real name. Yes. This is my name. - Tell me your name. - I told you my name. I told you a hundred times. We're not going anywhere. I just want you to know that. We are not going anywhere. Today, tomorrow, next week, next month. Yuri Modin. He is your mole. I am not your mole. - You understand? - I cannot tell you anything else. I'm gonna be right in front of you. The same position. - This is my name. - What is your name? My name is Valentin Gregorievich Mironov. This is my name. Tell me your name. I don't have a different name. - Tell it. - I don't have it. - Tell it to me again. - This is my name. - Valentin Gregorievich Mironov. - Tell it to me again. Valentin Gregorievich... Tell me your fucking name! Mironov! Valentin Gregorievich Mironov! We are gonna be here along time. This is my name! It's Valentin Mironov! Shut up! Shut up! I told you! I don't have a different... Tell me your name! Tell me your fucking name! Tell me your name! Tell me your name! Come on, tear it off. Get it off! Put him down. Your name. What is your name? Tell me your name. What is your name? Sir, this is lysergic acid diethylamide. It's called LSD. We've had some very favorable results as a truth serum. Look, it's him. Papa. Soviet power is a myth. A great show, but there are no spare parts. Nothing is working. It's nothing but painted rust. But you. You need to keep the Russian myth alive to maintain your military-industrial complex. Your system depends on Russia being perceived as a mortal threat. It's not a threat. It was never a threat. It will never be a threat. It Is a rotted, bloated cow. I am Valentin Gregorievich Mironov and I am free. Shit. Shit! If you would like, I'll be willing to take the truth serum, Edward. I've nothing to hide. I am who I say I am. I know. We send those who are leaving us to go into the world with the knowledge, wherever they go, whatever they do, they will never be alone. They will always be one of us. And we say, Bonesmen, all here. All here. I didn't know you smoked. There are a few things you don't know about me. I've spoken to a recruiter here. I would like very much to join CIA. There are a lot of things you can do, Edward. I'd like you to think about this very carefully. I have thought about it carefully. It's what I want to do. I want to join the Agency. I want to make you proud of me. I am proud of you. I've made up my mind, Father. You can stop him. He doesn't understand what he's getting into. You can stop him. - I can't tell him what to do. - Yes, you can. - No, I can't. - Yes, you can. Because he's doing it for you. Because he wants you to be proud of him. And he wants to feel closer to you. You could have them reject him. Absolutely not. I won't do that to him. Of course you won't. You wouldn't do anything for anybody but yourself. - That is unfair. - Unfair? That is unfair. You abandon the people when they need you the most. I don't abandon people! - You abandon people! - I do not abandon people. It's true. - I have stood by you for 22 years! - Stood by me? I have stood by you. You don't know what it is to stand by somebody. I stood by you and I have stood by him, I have done everything to be a good father to him. You have done no such thing! I married you because of him! I know you don't love me, but you love him. And no matter what, you should stand by him and you should protect him. I don't need you to tell me I have to protect my son. Promise me that you'll protect him. I'll protect him. Today, in Havana, Fidel Castro expelled high-profile crime figures from Cuba. He's taken control of their hotels and casinos, popular vacation destinations for many Americans. Castro has nationalized over $1 billion from U.S. businesses in the past six months, and there's no telling what the Communist dictator might do next. I want to see a man about a hat. He had three casinos down there until Castro sent him home. His people know how to be discreet. With the right encouragement, he could help. And he's very patriotic. Jimmy. Mr. Carlson. Tina, the kids. Come on, kids. Come on, come on. We're going to the beach. Let's go. Mom, please. Sit down. Want some water, some coffee, whatever? Is there some place else we could go? All right, Daddy, we're going down to the beach. We'll be back in a while. Make sure they don't go into the water unless somebody's watching them. No, I'm gonna let them drown. Make sure they put their shoes on. They'll burn their feet! We're getting their shoes! All right, come on. Let's go. So, what do you want to talk to me about? The government's about to deport you for certain activities. I've been in this country since I'm two months old. What does that make me, Italian? I'm American. And they're trying to send me back? I could have the deportation order reviewed. Have you classified as highly sensitive for national security. I could take the government off your back if you can help us. Youse are the guys that scare me. You're the people that make big wars. No, we make sure the wars are small ones, Mr. Palm.. Let me ask you something. We Italians, we got our families and we got the Church. The Irish, they have their homeland. The Jews, their tradition. Even the niggers, they got their music. What about you people, Mr. Carlson? What do you have? The United States of America. The rest of you are just visiting. The President wants the noise level on the operation turned down. How many men are involved? Fifteen hundred. Tell him we're going instead to Bahia de Cochinos. The noise level will be way down. We'll see you inside. Could you hear what we were talking about? No, I didn't hear anything. If something was heard, it has to stay in this room. Oh, I know that, Father. Yeah, all right. Bonesmen! All here! Reverend Christiansen will offer grace. Agency first, God second. Thank you, Lord, for bringing us safely here to be with our brothers and loved ones again. Our prayers are with our brothers whom God has seen fit to take into his gentle arms this year. The Honorable Senator John Russell, Senior. Mr. Stephen Loomis... Would you like to dance, Clover? I haven't been Clover for a long time. I'm going to Phoenix to live with my mother. Based on the ringing of the church bells, we're going to assume the recording was made at the same time the photograph was taken. We've checked the schedules for flights leaving major airports at or around 10:00 at night for a two-week period. There were flights leaving nine cities. Six were places that also would potentially have a fan made in Belgium. Five of those places were also either tropical or in their summer seasons. Three of those were places where French is spoken. We think the tape was made in either Dakar, Abidjan, or Congo-Leo. It is all gone. Hello, Mother. Let me show you. As you see, no cameras, no tape recorders. There is nothing else to know. Can I play something for you? Everything is a secret. You were brought up on secrets. What was such a big secret that his own son couldn't know? When he was standing outside talking, I'd heard something I wasn't supposed to, and he knew I'd listened to his conversation. I heard them say something in Spanish. Bahia de Cochinos. Bahia de Cochinos. I'm afraid of him. You are safe here with me. People who really love each other don't have secrets. I have something to tell you. I love you so much. I love you so much. She's been an active asset of ours for some time. Until now. She loves your son. Sometimes even spies fall in love. We can protect him. Make him safe. Nobody would know, not even him. All it would require is for you to help us when your help is needed. I thought you'd like to see this. She's a very pretty girl. It's easy to see why he fell for her. I know it's an extremely difficult situation for you. But I'm afraid I'm going to need your answer very soon. You must decide what is of more importance to you. Your country or... Or your son. She's not who you think she is. She's not a friendly, Edward. I don't believe you. Why should I believe you? You told me yourself not to trust anybody. You're the master at creating the truth. I love her. I've asked her to marry me. I will not let you take that away from me. I can't protect you anymore, I can't keep you safe. Safe? Safe? I never felt safe. I was always frightened. I always lived in fear that something awful was going to happen to you. Or if not, to Mother or to me. I was always afraid, because everything was a secret. Edward. Hello, may I come in? Yes. Of course. Is everything all right? I was on my way home from work and I had this overwhelming desire to hear you play the violin. Play the violin? But... Edward, I'm so tired. Can't this wait until tomorrow? I'd appreciate it if you'd play it now. Now? I just wanted to hear something from you that was true. He was careless. FBI. You're under arrest. Stand up. Didn't learn how to hide in plain sight. Where are they taking me? I can't go home! You know they can't trust me anymore! You know what they will do to me! Sorry, Edward. I truly did like you. I mean it. In another world, we actually would have been quite good friends. Are you still there, Mother? Your worst fear has come true. Alone and friendless without a country of your own. We have a whole new place to fight over. The stars. Your offer. I have to decline. You've succeeded in stopping us from taking back Cuba. The damage is done. There's no need for you to hurt my son. Let's just leave it between you and me. Very well. I will wait. But there will come a time when I will ask you to help me with a problem that wouldn't cost you much but be of some value to me. You never know what the future will bring. Friends can be enemies, and enemies friends. This girl, neither of us can be sure about her. But she's about to be a part of your family. I believe in family. You want her to be a part of your family, don't you? It was good to see you. We will talk again, my dear friend. Sorry to bother. I want to buy a little souvenir to my daughter. They have no change. What does it cost? It costs a dollar. Here. It's a gift. Regards from the United States government. It's a cardinal rule to be generous in a democracy. Thank you. So where is she? We're gonna meet her at the church. I can't wait to meet her. You'll love her. You're gonna love her. Yes, that's good. Come on in. Hello, Margaret. Let's celebrate. I'll get some champagne. How was the flight? It was long. How do you like living in Phoenix? It's the first time I've slept in years. Here we go. To your happiness. To your happiness. Your wife... What have you done? Will you go inside, Mother? Go inside, Mom. Please, just go in the church. She's pregnant. You couldn't... You couldn't have. - You couldn't. - No. I love you. I love you so much. - Mr. Wilson? - Mr. Hayes. Have you been here before, Mother? No, I haven't. Whose idea was that? It's classified. Mr. Allen has notified the President he'll resign. Something about Swiss bank accounts. Where did these come from? They were in the car. I thought you had them sent down, sir. Seems the greedy bastard has been hiding money away for years. Whoever had the statements sent them to him in a box of Swiss chocolates. It wasn't you, was it? The President's asked me to become Director and do a complete housecleaning at my discretion. I need someone I can trust. After all, we're still brothers. This building doesn't get built without you. You're CIA's heart and soul. Who knows, you might have a secret about me in that safe of yours. This whole wing will be your part of the world. Counterintelligence. Take a look around. I've got an oversight meeting. Can you imagine? They think they can look into our closet. As if we'll let them. I remember a senator once asked me when we talk about CIA, why we never use the word "the" in front of it. And I asked him, "Do you put the word 'the' in front of God?" "They are right what they say about me." "I was weak. A coward." "I compromised myself." "My honor. My family. My country." "I am ashamed of myself." "To my wife, I am sorry I've done this to you." "To my son," "I hope you will grow to be a courageous man." "A good husband. A good father." 'I hope whatever you decide to do, you lead a good, full life. "I hope whatever your dreams may be come true." "Your loving husband and father."
