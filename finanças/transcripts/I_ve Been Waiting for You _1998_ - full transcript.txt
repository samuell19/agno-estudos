Faster! Witch! Come on, you! - Devil! - Witch! Get her! Seize her! Burn, witch! Burn, witch! Burn, witch! - Tightly! - Bind her tightly! She must not escape! I wonder if you could help me. I'm looking for a house on Yardley. - The address is, uh-- - The Lancaster house. - Excuse me? - You're looking for the Lancaster house. - Yeah, that's right. - Straight into town... left at the church, right on second... to Yardley. Thank you. Hey, Sleeping Beauty. - What's with the grim reaper? - Yeah, he was weird. But he was also very helpful. He says we're not far from there. This is it? What doy ou think? Is it home? Tell the truth, but keep in mind we've got six months paid in advance on this house. Do you hate it? I've seen this house before. I know this house. Yeah, of course you've seen it before. The realtor sent us a picture to approve. Oh. Right. Okay. Let's go look. Smells like something died in here. It could use a little airing out. It hasn't been open in a while. Well, that's a good sign. The power's on. - It's so old. - The original house was built in 1672. Only thing that old in LA is the ocean. No phone yet. Can't order pizza. You hungry? - Starving. - Oh, okay. Well, I'll make you a deal. You bring in a few boxes, and I'll go on a fastfood run. And leave me alone in this place? Oh, please, no. Anything but that. - Are burgers okay? - Veggie for me, if you can find one. I think even in Massachusetts, I can find a veggie burger. I won't be long. Fasy, cat. You may have nine lives, but I've got just one. No collar. You have a name? You must be hungry. What's the matter? Cat got your tongue? I think we have tuna. Here we go. You must be hungry, cat. Great. Hello? Hello? I've been waiting for you. Hello? Yes? Sarah? - Yes? - Welcome home. Who is this? Hello? Sorry, honey. Hey, why are the lights out? - The power-- - Sorry. I did the best I could. No veggie burgers, but I gotthe next best thing. Chicken. Did you find the plates? - I think the phone's working. - Yeah? No, not yet. I'll drop by the phone company tomorrow after workand check on the account. Hungry? Sarah, come on. You're going to be late. - Wouldn't want that to happen. - Are you nervous? What? Being trapped inside a building full of kids I have absolutely nothing in common with? Honey, you know, if you just wouldn't hide behind those flip remarks... you push people away before they get a chance to know the real you. Face it, Mom. I'm a square peg in a round world. Even the cat deserted me. - Probably got a better offer. - Come on. You'll befine. We both will. This is our chance at a new life. I'll take "'60s song titles" for 500, Alex. - Sorry, babe, that seat's reserved. - You should have posted a sign. I don't need a sign. Everyone knows where I sit, my girlfriend Debbie sits. - She expects it. - Get over yourself. - Maybe you didn't hear me. - She heard you, Kev. She just didn't care. Deb can take that seat over there. Hi, I'm Eric Garrett. You're new. "Palm reading."You intothis? I'm intoa lotofthings. It's a bigworld. Thatstuff'sjust... stuff, though, right? I mean, you can't tell about a person just by looking at his palm. Can you? I'd say you're a jock. Probably... football. And this line right here... this says you probably drive... a tricked-out, jacked-up SUV. Creepy. Well, uh... Where you from anyway? - A distant land called California. - And how'd you know all that stuff? I read the book. Eric, did you forget you were supposed to pick me up? That was this morning. Sorry. I had a lot on my mind. So I see. Sorry, Mr. Rankin. Okay, can we get down to business, everyone? Today, you'll note that we have a new student: Miss Sarah Zoltanne. I know you'll all make her feel welcome. Freak! Thank you, Mr. Lane. I appreciate that. And did you catch the clothes? Can't wait to get a look at her. You're that new one, aren't you? - Sarah something? - Zoltanne. - You smoke? - Thanks, no. How'd you know that stuff about Eric? I mean, his car, football. You didn't buy that hocus-pocus thing, did you? She probably saw him drive up. The letterman's jacket might be a clue. That was it, wasn't it? I see I can't put anything past you. Word isy ou're from Los Angeles. - That's right. - Well, that doesn't impress us one bit. So tell you what--you stay out of our way and we just might stay out of yours. Did you know smoking causes wrinkles? Attitude! Misty, put it out! Okay, who tossed their smoke? - Not me. - No. I was wondering when I was going to get to meet the new girl. Charlie Gorman. Sarah Zoltanne. My mom and I just moved here from L.A. Well, that explains the look. I'm from New York. Seven years now. Can I help you with anything? Yeah, I could use some incense, actually. The house we're renting has a strange feeling about it. Yeah, sure. Uh, over here. Where are you living? The old house down at Second and Yardley. The Lancaster house. That house has kind of a history. - Do tell. - Well... Salem got all the press, but we had a witch of our own. Three hundred years ago, five men dragged her out of that house... and burned her at the stake up at Gallows Point. That's where they used to hang criminals. This is conveniently located right next to your new home sweet home. That little park? Cool. You're kidding, right? No. And as she went up in flames... she promised to come back from the grave... and punish all their descendants one by one. Welcome to Pinecrest. It's a great place to raise kids. Sounds like incense alone might not cut it. Do you have anything in industrial strength? Just the thing. There's a ritual in here to clear the space of any leftover energy. And, um... you'll need these candles. I didn't bring enough cash to cover all that. That's fine. No problem. I mean, you can bring it by tomorrow or whenever. Thanks. - Thank you very much. - Thanks. - Oh, geez! - Wait, let me help. They don't make paperbags the way they used to. Yeah. Thank you. Ted! It's Rosemary Zoltanne. You were on the school board interviewing committee. Right, right, the new third grade teacher. - That's right. - Hey, I met your daughter today. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, yeah, she's a nice kid. Sweet, smart. Are you sure it was my daughter you met? I'm impressed. You've got some real groceries here. The kind that doesn't come frozen. Fresh meat, vegetables. What do you do with that stuff? I take it you're unfamiliar with the concept of cooking. My ex-wife never clued me in... to the dark secrets of blenders and microwaves. I see. So, how long has it been since you had a home-cooked meal? - Uh, a year and a half. - Oh, get out. Yeah. - That's a lot of drive-throughs. - Yeah. Well, you know... maybe when I get my kitchen together, you can come over for a meal sometime. Oh. Was that pushy? Oh, no, no. Well,y es. But I'd love to. Great. Okay. Thank you for your help. "O spirits of the world beyond, hear my voice and obey." What Stephen King wanna be wrote this stuff? "I beseech you to cleanse this house of the sinister forces of darkness. If you can see me, show yourselves." Sinister forces, come on down. Hi. I just came in to say good night. What is all this? Oh, I'm clearing the house of bad energy. I see. Okay, well,while you'reat it, would you mind doing my room too? Did you know this was a witch's house 300 years ago? Whotoldyou that? Oh, around. Probably some stupid legend. Yeah, well, I suppose every small town has something like that. So how was school today? Oh, the faces of those little third graders are so cute. One of them even brought mean apple for my first day at school. Never too early to learn the fine art of sucking up. When did you get to be such a smart aleck? When I wasn't looking? That's when it all happens. Good night, my love. Good night, Mom. Here, kitty. What's your name anyway? Ebony? Storm? Something mysterious maybe. How about Hecuba? Hecuba? Was that a lucky guess or are you just easy? "What remained of the witch laid to rest... outside the hallowed ground of old Pinecrest. Her body and bones were ground by night... and her dust laid within her family's sight." Family's sight. "Beneath the arbor, she doth repose... below the bramble and buried rose." "Sarah Lancaster." "Let God be her judge." I hear you live in the witch's house. - Everybody's gotta live somewhere. - I suppose so, but there? You wouldn't catch me alone within a mile of that place. - You want to put that in writing? - Buy a clue. I was just trying to help. Kyra, I'm not buying the sincerity angle. Help me what? Um, find chemistry? - What? - Fit in. If you just dressed a little more like a human being and lost some of that attitude-- I just want to get through this year and then find my way back to civilization. - Hey, Sarah. - Oh, hey, Charlie. Fairwarning-- he's so not a part of the crowdy you want to know. Maybe that's what I like about him. Damn you guys! Smells like they had a keggerin here. Shoot! - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Caught me by surprise, that's all. You think I'd be used to it by now. Hated to waste all that good brew, man, but, you know-- - Man, that look on his face! - Hey, hey, hey! Calm down. You have to learn how to take it, Charlie. Otherwise he's never going to let up, huh? Are there any grown-ups in the crowd? Let's see hands. Somebody call a janitor and clean this up before someone slips. I'll do that, Mr. Rankin. Always happy to help out. Had to be the wind, didn't it? Well, didn't it? It's been exactly 300 years. Almost to the day. "Justice." And then this terrible thought hit me like a scud missile. What if Sarah isn't who she seems? "Death." It's possible if she's who she might be. "The fool." Then we're the ones who'll pay. The five of us. We can't jump to conclusions. "The devil." We have to be prepared. I mean, lookat how she read your palm and the ways he dresses. That crystal thing. She's not one of us. Which could mean... she's one of them. "Judgment." Hecuba! Hecuba. Here, kitty. Hey, you out there? Hecuba. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Alger Hiss was accused in 1948... of supplying Soviet agents with classified documents... when he worked in the state department in the 1930s. - What was the outcome of that? - He sued for slander... but was found guilty of committing perjury in 1950... and sentenced to prison. This was all kind of a precursor to the Communist witch hunts... which began that year and continued until 1954 in the McCarthy era. Who arranged her life? I mean, a TV series and now her own era? Jenny McCarthy is so there. See ya, geek! All that talk about witch hunts? So positively X-Files. What's up with that? Well, I know someone who could find out-- Eric. I mean, come on. Stevie Wonder could see how she drools over him. How about it, Kyra? Feel like sacrificing your boyfriend for the common good? Well, the real curse of Pinecrest is small minds. I mean, anyone the least bit different has to be the son of Satan or something. By the way, I just got this new CD. It's 13th century Tibetan chants. It really takes you to another place. - If you like, we could always-- - No, wait, I-- - You trying to kill yourself? - Just out for a drive. That's your idea of driving? California girls are meant to drive in style. How about it? Eric, can't you see she's not interested? Sarah, let's go. Come on. Let me show you the town, huh? What town? Thanks, but I could use the exercise. You know, fresh air and all. It's possibly a one time offer. I'll risk it. Life on the edge, you know? Whatever. I don't think Eric's ever heard "no" before. - You are really something. - Don't give me so much credit. I came this close to taking him upon it. Do you ever wonder what it's like to be in the "in" group? Sarah, being in the "in" group is no big deal. If you have the right ancestors, you can even get into groups you don't want to be in. What's that supposed to mean? Forget it. Open mouth, insert foot. - Hey. - You going somewhere? Yeah. Gota teacher's meeting in a half an hour. Also, Ted Rankin's asked me out for a bite afterwards. As in my history teacher? Tell me you're joking. Should I have cleared this with you first? Hey, it's your life. Is this okay with you-- my evening plans? Home alone with no parental supervision? Does that make me an official latchkey kid? Honey, I'm sorry. I really didn't think you'd mind. There's plenty of choices for dinner. The fridge is full. Will you do me a favor and eat whatever's on the verge of spoiling? I love you too. Right on time. Hi. Come on in. - You've met my daughter Sarah. - Hi. I... hope this won't be an awkward situation for you. My whole life's been an awkward situation. I've learned to deal. I won't be late. Good-bye. # Tell me your secret what you desire# #I will still be there for you# #And tell me you need it tell me something you're not# #I will still be there for you# # You light up my dreams# #Light up my skin# #You're so far away# #You're holdin' it in# #I'm lookin' around# #Watching it spin# #Got my world outside it's changin'# #There's something about you# Boo! - Why so jumpy? - Sorry. Welcome to the neighborhood. Damn it! You scared the hell out of me. - Relax! - Why don'tyou put some clothes on? Did the invention of the doorbell slip so totally by you? - How'd you guys get in? - Please. Every kid in Pinecrest... knows at least 50 secret ways to get in this place. Lancaster house was likea rite of passage to see how brave you were. - Or how stupid. - Not if you know the legend. Oh, that burned at the stake town curse. Next? It's what happened before that night that's the real story. It's how they discovered she was a witch. See, she was all hot for this guy who didn't even know she existed. And she couldn't handle that. Her mind snapped. - Because of a guy? - He was really, really cute. So she gets committed to this mental institution-- padded walls, straitjacket. - I get the picture. - Anyway... while she's in there, the guy gets set to marry the finest lady in Pinecrest. - We're talking blond, beautiful. - She had red hair. Whatever. Anyway, night before the wedding... this girl, guy's fiancee... she hears this whisperin the night-- "I've been waiting for you." Now, it's dark... and she doesn't know where it's coming from. So she yells out for her mom. "Mom!" No answer. Old man-- nothing. Actually, it was her father, then her mother, but... - she hears it again. - "I've been waiting for you." So she gets out of bed, go to check out the house... and when she gets to the living room... she sees her future husband sitting in the dark... not moving, not saying a word. So, she moves in closer... and sees that he's been slashed to ribbons... and left to bleed to death. - Actually, he was dead already. - Does it matter? The point is... she's so scared, she can't even scream. And she hears the voice again. "I've been waiting for you." Runs up to her parents' room. Same story. Blood everywhere. And the killer is out there somewhere. So she heads for her room... shaking like crazy, locks the door, and as she passes near her bed-- Witch's hand comes out from under it... grabs her, pulls her down with long sharp claws... cuts her head clean off. The cops swarm all over the place the next day, but... there's no sign of the witch. - So where was she? - Still locked up in the institution. Doctors say she never left. But she's rocking back and forth, and she's laughing about something. So they undo her straitjacket and they find... that her nails have grown into claws... and that they are caked with fresh blood. There are so many holes in that story, I don't even know where to begin. - Like? - Like-- Like after all this, they just released her to come home? She escaped. This is where they found her and burned her that night. And now, it has been exactly 300 years since the curse. So what's this to you? We're part of the descendants' club. If anyone's going to bite it, it's us five. It's our century. Yeah, you see, the curse is really specific. This generation pays for the sins of that generation. It's kind of Shakespearean, don't you think? Me, Eric, Debbie, Kevin and Misty. Oh, and there's one thing we haven't told you. The witch, the one who's supposed to come back this year-- Her name was Sarah. So what? Like, I'm the witch? You tell us. Come to think of it, she had a cat too. A big black one, just like yours. Look, I'm tired. Party's over. Oh! Speaking of party, I am having one... and we'd like to invite you as the official guest of honor. What, so you and your descendants' club can burn me at the stake... and roast marshmallows by the fire? No. Wew ant you to tell fortunes. - Oh, you got to be kidding. - I've got it all wired. I broke into the school records. I've got dirt on everybody. Oh, your parents must be so proud. Look, why me? Why not Debbie or Misty or someone? Well, that's the beauty part. You're new to this town. You don't know anybody, so their heads will spin at anything you tell them. It's going to be great. Come on, what do you say? Are you going to help us out? Will you play the game? Hmm? I have to know what's going on right now. Sarah, if there's anything you can tell me... I've been waiting for you. No! Help me! No! Help me! Somebody! No! No! This is going to be great. #Everybody's searching for something# #Expecting nothing as the world keeps spinning around and round# #Everybody's lost in losing# #Now then the ceiling and the walls hear what I was around# #Now I'm trying to pour cheap wine eavesdrop party lines# Sarah! Cool costume. - These are my clothes. - Oh. - I thought you weren't going to show. - Yeah, well, me neither. Well, come on. This is going to be cool. - Where's Kyra? - Oh, she's decorating. Whoa! Hello! Uh, we need this room. Now. Have a great night. All right, now, this is... this is going to be a bit of a challenge. Have a seat. All right, now you are going to have to run this wire down here... and take this microphone and put it in your-- I know. I saw Mission Impossible. Right. - I have to go to the bathroom. - No, no, no, no, no. You're not going anywhere. But I hate parties. Well, you're going to love this one. - I don't know anyone. - Well, you know me. What was that? They don't do that in LA? Not like that and not to me. Well, it's about time. Besides, you're beautiful. Hey, where you guys been? Oh, making out, lip-locking, tongue-wrestling. You know-- the usual. Yeah. Very funny. Nice outfit. So when someone comes in, you ask their name, then repeat it. Don't worry. I'll tell you everything you need to know. Just listen and repeat. Listen and repeat. You got it? - Not exactly brain surgery. - Cool. - Testing! One, two! - Ow! - Not so loud. - Sorry. You'll be great. Good luck. Note to self: get a real life. Whoa! Hey, where you going? I'm going to get my fortune told. Hey, spud boy, I'll tell you your fortune. Yeah, get lost, Charlie. Fortunes are for people with futures. So, what do I do? Do I just... sit here or do a trance thing or what? - State your name. - Kevin Lane. Tell him you see him in a dark place. What? I mean-- What, o great spirits? I see you. Younger. It's a very dark, very tight place. How old? Seven. It's cold. You're very frightened. No way. Nobody knows this. The spirits know everything. He's in a cave. - You were trapped in a cave. - Yeah. Yeah, the whole roof caved in. Dirt and rocks. - I couldn't breathe. - You didn't think you'd get out. I thought-- I thought I was going to die. I still have this fear-- claustrophobia. I can't even be in tight places. They totally freak me out. Sometimes you dream about it. Okay, that's enough. Tell me something about my future. Am I going to geta scholarship to State or what? No. Damn! Noway. - Okay, so what's going on now? - Shh! Someone else is in the room. And what would you like to ask the spirits? I don't know. Um... What would you say the chance is of, um... you going out with me? I'm afraid the spirits can't answer that question. Tell him he's a twisted little dweeb. You are a thoughtful and sensitive young man. In sixth grade, he actually wet his pants in class. You're a water sign, aren't you? I'm Aquarius. Then you should be careful of fire. - Fire? - Yeah, and smoke. She's not telling him anything. This is boring. Let's go. I'm over this. Who's going to give her the answers? Let her fly by the seat of her broomstick. - What'd she say? - Some freaky stuff. Aw, that's not a happy face. You missed a spot. Good luck, Deb. You'll need it. Whoa, Kyra. Come in, spirit world. The name's Debbie, not Kyra. And you might as well know I don't believe in all this... so do your worst. Well, you have a love. Like the whole school doesn't know about Kevin. I mean... another love. - What do you know about that? - The spirits know everything. Well, it's over. It was just that one time. They really know everything? Does Kyra know? That you slept with-- With Eric! Does she know? Not a word! I swear, if you tell anybody-- It stays between me and the spirit world. It damn well better. Come to us in cauldron dark. Grant to us thy wisdom spark. Transform, transmute and ring us in. 'Tis the hour to begin. Power now to us reveal of the turning of the wheel. Look, you don't have to tell me anything. - Nothing at all. - Spirits, speak! Your mother-- she's in danger. - What? - Yes. She's fallen, but not really. Your mother's in a hospital. She told the doctor she fell, but she didn't. - My father hit her, okay? - Something's going to happen. - Tonight? - Yes. Oh, my God. She's alone. Look, I'm sorry! This is all a game, a party trick. No, no. Nobody could have known that, okay? Where did you really come from, and what are you doing here? - Misty, look, I can explain! - Get out of my thoughts! Just stay away from me, you bitch! Come on. Come on. Please. Please. I just want to go home. - Misty, I've been waiting for you. - Oh, God! Help! Somebody help me! Gotcha! Who are you? What do you want from me? Everything. Please! No, no! No! No! No! No! This doesn't make any sense. I mean, we all saw Misty leave the party, right? Cops were asking if she was doing drugs, drinking. I don't understand how she could die without a mark on her. - Carbon monoxide poisoning? - The windows were blown in. - There were scratches on the car. - She was scared to death. One down, four to go. You think Sarah had something to do with it? - Maybe not directly. - But it was still her fault. How do you figure? Whatever she told Misty made her so upset, she ran right for her car. She was totally on with me. She had to know-- We have to talk. - Misty is dead and everybody's looking at me like I made it happen. - What did you say to her? I told her what you told me to tell her. You have to tell them about the game. Look, Sarah, I didn't say a word about Misty. I don't have a clue what you're talking about. I heard your voice. If you heard a voice, it must have been a voice in your head. After Kevin and Charlie left the party, Kyra was out of there. Really. - What's going on here? - Damn it! I know what I heard! Go, one! Push it! Push it! Go, two. We're timing this one. Go, three. Hold up, everybody. Miss Zoltanne, do you have a problem with this drill? I can't swim, okay? I never even learned the basics. I mean, can I do, like, a paper on Greg Louganis or something instead? We thought you California types were all hang ten and hot tubs. Please, Miss Flting? See me after class and we'll try and work something out. Okay, Sarah, mental reboot. This is a growth experience. Everyone should know how to swim. Could come in handy later in life... assuming there is a later-in-life. I come to Massachusetts to learn this? Hello? Miss Elting? Sarah. Hello. Sarah. Look, is someone there? Hello. I've been waiting for you. No! No! I'm sorry. It was a stupid prank. No. It was a test, and you failed big time. You sank like a stone, witch woman. That's not how it works. The rule is that witches float! Hey, hey, hey, come on! Really, I'm sorry. You could have killed her, Eric. What are you saying? We need to talk. We do? Now who's psychic? I don't have to be psychic to know something's bothering my daughter. Some of the kids are blaming me. They're saying that Misty was upset... because of that party game that Eric talked me into. - You had nothing to do with that. - I know that. I don't think you do. I think you're buying into this. Hey, look, sit down. Sit down, sweetheart. The fact is-- Come on. The fact is terrible things happen to people. It seems to be human nature to try to assign blame. Because my name is Sarah, and I fit their witch profile? Sarah-- that was the witch's name. What are the odds, right? It's ridiculous. Honey, what have we always said when we have a problem? Sarah? Sarah. Yeah, I know. - Take the beef to the boss. - Right. Do you want me to talk to their parents? No, Mom, don't, please. That'll just make things worse. I know how I have to deal with this. It's cold. But then I like the cold. Are you here for Eric? - Yeah, but I'm-- I-- - He's home. It's okay. I'm his mom. You must be Sarah Zoltanne. I know the rest of his friends. Process of elimination, I guess. The whole town's talking about you. You're just what we expected. Come in. Hey, Sarah. What are you doing here? - I need your help. - See? She needs help, Eric. So help her, okay? Look, this isn't easy for me. I mean, I don't... I don't open up a lot. I don't trust people. But it feels like you're the only one who's even a little bit on my side. Yeah. Well, I... I admit it was my fault getting you into this whole psychic thing. - Who knew where it was going, huh? - Kyra did. Whether she admits it or not, she fed me those lines. She was with me. They didn't just pop out of my imagination. Are you sure? Come to join our study group? There's a rumor. Three's a crowd. I'm sorry. I thought-- I didn't know. What? That Kyra would be here? Sorry to disappoint you. I wish I could help, but, uh-- Sot hat's it? You too? You really think some 300-year-old crone... has crept into my body while I'm sleeping or something... to set up this descendants' club of yours for the kill? Is that what you really think? I'm sorry I even tried. She is one creepy female. Kyra, shut up. Miss Thompson? Miss Murdock? Can I have a moment of your time, please? Is this like something serious? You won't need an attorney present, if that's what you're worried about. M-I-S-T-Y! We miss you, Misty! This isn't good-bye! M-I-S-T-Y! We miss you, Misty! This isn't good-bye! What a nerve she had. Showing up at the funeral? Close as she could come to the scene of the crime. I think it's time for revenge. - What if they're asleep? - To oearly. Besides, I called twice. Nobody's home. Doesn't anybody ever dust down here? Follow me. Shh! - Hey, I got this list of things. - Shh! Yeah? They're supposed to be dead giveaways. "Pentagrams... "human skulls... "black candles... fear of water." Human skulls? Just check out the night table. Hey, look at this. It's a book of witch's spells. There's a love potion in here. Be careful she doesn't use that on you, Eric. Hey, guys, check this out. What's that thing? It's a spirit board. You use it for talking to dead guys. Like an E-mail to Elvis? Maybe this will tell us what we need to know. Well, what's supposed to happen? It's supposed to move, spell things out. Well, I think we all know what the question is. Is Sarah a witch? Shh! Stop it! Hecuba, are you up there? Come on! Come on, this way! Let's get out of here! Let's go! - Hey, watch it. - What the hell are you doing? - Hey, loser! - What are you doing, cleaning house? Whoa! Oh, my-- Help! Help! No! Help! Help! No! - I'm going to go in. - All right, I got your back. All right. Go on. Hurry up. Take him. All right, he's breathing. Get him on O2. Stand back, folks! Please stay back! Miss! Miss! All right, everybody, stay back. Sarah,y ou told me at the party. - You knew about the fire. - Charlie. You knew! Get upon the curb. People being killed, fire. It's like the seven plagues of Egypt. - But there's only been two of them. - So far. And I don't think one of the plagues was being scared to death. The fire? That was Sarah's prediction for Charlie at the party. It all comes back to Sarah, doesn't it? - Charlie. - Can't talk now. Late for class. You've got time. Did they find out what happened? The fire marshal said it was an accident... but I can tell you what happened last night. - Someone was there. - You're not still on this witch kick. Besides, isn't it the descendants' club she's supposed to be after-- the legendary five? I told you I'm from New York, right? Well, my great-grandparents were from here-- from Pinecrest. All right, well, my great-greatgrandfather... put the match on the bonfire that night. So you're a descendant too? But that makes it six. And if the legend's true-- Then means someone in the group doesn't belong. Something doesn't add up. Literally. Charlie, don't you start avoiding me too. I can't help it, Sarah. I'm scared. I admit it, okay? I'm really, really scared. Would you mind if I took a rain check on dinner tonight? - What's the matter? - I don't know. It's just the idea of someone out there terrorizing these kids. The way their ancestors terrorized that innocent girl that night. That doesn't make it right. Doesn't make any of this right. I hate violence, but I understand that nature seems to want to find a balance. - Wrongs need to be righted. - An eye for an eye? Yes, and I feel awful about that. Even the parents don't seem to care. But I've got-- We've got to make a stand. What are you saying? I'm just trying into put things into perspective is all. - Oh, you mean, like us against them? - No, no, no. Rosemary, listen to me. That's not what I meant. All I wanted was to have a quiet evening alone with you. I'm sorry. Could you just please take me home? Mom? You up? Forgot my key. I've been waiting for you. Hey! Who's there? Mom? I keep going over this research, but it's so complicated. So many names, so many tangled family trees. I need someone who knows this town. Someone I can trust. Someone who might see a connection I'd pass right over. Sorry. Nobody comes to mind. You're running hot and cold lately. Are you with me or not? What's up? Look, I've already played the starring role in Backdraf. Maybe that's it for me. So you're going to keep a low profile and hope this whole thing goes away? - You have a better plan? - Wake up, Charlie. It isn't just going to go away. Not until we make it go away. You and me. Everyone else is just too afraid to do anything. Look, Sarah, I can't be a part of it anymore. Fine. But what if the fire wasn't enough? What if this witch or whoever isn't satisfied... until everyone's six feet under, including you? I didn't say it was a perfect plan but, yeah, that about covers it. I obviously had you mistaken for someone I could count on. I'm sorry about freaking out in there. One thing's for sure. We can eliminate Eric... because he saw the witch-- at least in the dark with his eyes wide shut. - Yeah, well, he saw something. - Well, Misty saw something too. Of course, I'm guessing on that one. Sarah, I know you didn't have anything to do with the fire. It's just some freaky coincidence, but somebody out there is bad news. And it's not some supernatural creature. It's some freakin a mask. Could it be Kevin? Could he pull this off? Sarah, come on. Kevin is lucky if he can pull his own socks off. What about Debbie or Kyra? Highly unlikely? Well, it's always the most unlikely ones who've fooled them all. Well, why would Kyra try to cut up Eric? I don't know. Maybe if you dated him, you wouldn't have to ask. - Did that sound sarcastic? - No, but that's okay. Damn. I meant it to sound sarcastic. - You're not helping, okay? - Well, I think we should face it. I mean, if any of us has a motive for picking off those guys, it's... me. Think about it. Those guys beat me up every single week in grade school... and they put snakes in my backpack and ants in my gym shorts. I'm the obvious choice. Which makes you definitely not the killer. Except that makes me the most obvious choice again... because I'm the least obvious choice, because I'm the most obvious choice-- You know what I mean. - So are you the witch? - No. - Would you tell me if you were? - No. Garlic, you morons, is for vampires. What, you don't believe me? Ask Buffy. Doesn't anybody in this school watch television? A little early for trick or treat, isn't it? - Apparently not. - I am so sorry about this. I tried talking to Kyra and Debbie. Well, this is their idea of help. You think this is their work? Just because you're running into some adjustment problems... - doesn't mean the whole world-- - Adjustment problems? Not getting picked for the prom committee-- that's an adjustment problem. But being accused of stalking and murder and witchcraft... not to mention the suggestion that I would hop into the nearest fireplace... somehow I think this is a little more complicated. I'm telling you it had to be a guy. You don't think a girl can fight dirty when she's pushed too far? There's no way it could be Sarah. Please! She could be pumped up on steroids for all we know. Look, all I know is, that thing is strong. Where's Kevin? He was supposed to meet us here after practice for a burger run. He's on the field or in the locker room or something. Coach wanted to talk to him. Kev's mind hasn't exactly been on the game lately. No, duh. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Like you really care. You won't be happy until we're all dead. Kyra, cool it. Whose side are you on anyway? Listen to him, Kyra, and don't push me. It's been a long day, and I'm way too tired for this. Oh, give us all a huge break. - You are just so totally transparent. - Okay, I've had it. You'd better be careful because we all know how this curse works. You're the chosen group. Generation "ex." E-X, as in ex-humans. Soon to be formerly amongst the living. And if I am a witch, then making that happen becomes my job description. And maybe just the right word to the right best friend... would be all it would take. Isn't that right, Debbie? What was she talking about? What does she know? How to make my skin crawl. Let's take a rain check on the burger, okay? ## Ha! Ha, ha. Help! Kev, you still here? Hey, what's taking you so long? Hey, Kev, you in there? Kevin! 911 ? Eric. Why there? Hello? Eric? Debbie. Eric, is that you? I've been waiting for you. Why couldn't we have just met at the mall? Where are you? Eric? Come on, don't play games now. I didn't tell Sarah about you and me, if that's what you want to talk about. She psyched it out. And I won't tell Kyra. Somebody! Please don't! Please don't! No! Don't kill me! Please don't kill me! Something much worse. No! Not my face! Not my face! - Eric. - Hey. Last person you expected to see... or wanted to see. No. No, it's okay. Comeon in. What's all this? You doing your family tree? Look, Sarah, this is-- This whole thing's gotten way out of hand. I mean, I know this witch thing doesn't have anything to do with you, and, uh... I just want to say that I'm really sorry for everything that we've done to you. Well, thanks, but I think I've found something you should take a look at. I'm worried about you, Sarah. You can see that I'm still standing. I... I don't think you realize. You're different... and Pinecrest doesn't exactly like new or different. So, short of moving to Siberia for winterquarter-- No, no, I'm not saying I want you to move. Different isn't necessarily a bad thing. Look, could we-- Could we go somewhere else to talk? You know, neutral territory. This place has got a lot of history for me. I'm sure Kyra would love that. Uh, um-- We're through. I-I told her at school. So, coffee, herbal tea? Anything you want? No talk of descendants' clubs or witches or anything? I promise. It's a big world, remember? There's got to be something we have in common. Oh, let me get that. Seat belt's a little tricky. Here. Get her! I got her. Goon! Go! I see these kids getting away with murder day after day... without any idea that their actions have any consequences. Yeah, I know, but they're good kids, Ted. They're just thought less, but they're young, you know, and they're still learning. They're learning because we teach them, you and I. Some lessons are harder to learn than others. Yeah. Well, you know, it's late and I'm really tired. I don't know what gets into me. Sometimes I talk before I think, and now you're upset. I'm not upset. I'm not upset. Really. I'm just tired... and I'm worried about Sarah. - Can I call you? - I don't know, Ted. Maybe it wouldn't be such a good idea. No, really. Until things get straightened out, I feel like Sarah needs me at home. Okay. Right. - Okay. - Thanks. What in the world is this? I gave a student a ride home the other day. It's probably some shop class project. Careful. Thanks, Ted. - Good night. - Good night. Sarah? Honey? You still up? Sarah! - Shut up! - Let go of me! Are you guys crazy? You don't actually believe this witch stuff, do you? I don't know. Let's ask Misty or Kevin or Eric. This is insane. You have to listen to me. I know what's been going on, and I can make it stop. Nothing you could sayis going to change what's happened. Someone has to pay. What's the next test? Birthmark shaped like a crescent moon. Don't forget the bookstore fire. Charlie's a descendant of the original five. - Do you know that? - Charlie? Yeah, right. You're kidding. - He told me! - There are only five of us. There's always only been five of us. This is how witches work. They confuse you, twist your thoughts. Hey! A birthmark! - It's not shaped like a moon. - She could have had it changed. Will you just listen! I checked your family trees, okay? Charlie had a great-grandmother named Margaret Spencer. Does that ring a bell, Debbie? Your great aunt. Oh, my God. You mean Charlie and I are related? So there's six of us instead of five. So what? More for her to kill. What's your point? Just think what's happened, Eric. Come on, think. You, Misty, Kevin, Debbie-- Charlie's fire. Everybody-- Everyone except for Kyra. He's right. How come you got off without a scratch? Don't you see what she's doing? - Is it true, Kyra? - Stop it, you guys. It's not Kyra. The point is, your ancestors weren't the only ones who had descendants. Sarah Lancaster had a family too-- an older sister named Hannah who knew how to hold a grudge and pass it along. Sarah's older sister married a man named Virgil Rankin. I found his direct line from the old Sarah to Ted Rankin. Mr. R? The history teacher? You expect us to believe he's behind all this? He had a kid who disappeared. - Reality check on table three. - Sorry, Sarah. What's next? If you cut a witch, her blood won't run. Well, cut her! Sarah. Sarah. Sarah? Sarah! Get out! Get out! Oh, no. - Eric, no. - Okay, okay. It's not me you should be worried about, Kyra. Ask your best friend about her night with Eric. What? - Debbie? - She's making it up. - You bitch! - It was only one night! It meant nothing, Kyra! I say we torch her! Let's finish her off for good! This is murder! She's right, Deb. We can't take it this far. - No! - It's her or us! It's the witch! Give me a hand here, Kyra! - Eric! - Watch out! Untie me! Eric, look out! You ugly bitch! - I'm coming! - Debbie! Hang on! Hang on! Hey! Get him! - Charlie! - Charlie? Why'd you do it, man? Come on! Tell me! You try being a bastard son! Your parents drove my mother out of here.Ask them all. - It's all your fault. Blame yourselves. - What is he talking about? Tell them, Sarah... how the sins of our fathers are visited on the children. Ted? Ted Rankin's your father? - Was my father. - That's disgusting. How did you make this? Metal shop. A month has past since that awful night. The tangled web of secrets that Charlie kept hidden all those years... finally took its toll As a pregnant, scared teenager, Charlie's mother was run out of town... by the same hypocrisy that burned a witch 300 years before. We'll never know if Ted Rankin really was Charlie's father.. because he mysteriously disappeared from Pinecrest that night. Odd Maybe, but not to me. You see, I knew all along that Charlie was right. There were six descendants. As for Sarah Lancaster.. some legends never die. She did come back... because a promise... is a promise. Six descendants in a row... generations yet to know. Powers cast their fiery glow... secrets only witches know. Two down... four to go. I've been waiting for you.
