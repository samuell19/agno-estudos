Yeah, we got cut off. This train doesn't have heating, let alone Wi-Fi. So, as I was telling you. No, we'd been planning the night out for weeks. These two guys come over and start saying it's easier to get in with girls and can they join us. Of course, you know us, we said yes. We felt so cool: "Yeah, we're the bomb!" We're like: "No problem, guys, you'll definitely get in." We split into two groups as there was already five of us. Better than going up all at once. The first group get in, no problem. Guy opens the door, they just breeze in. Then we get there and he goes: "Sorry, ladies, I can't let you in tonight." Just like that! Yeah, that's all he says. But we're like: "Let's try again." So we try again. So we... We wait in line. We get up there a second time... and he says the same thing: "Sorry, ladies, not tonight." Hold on... Sorry, would you mind sitting somewhere else? Am I bothering you? No, but there's loads of empty seats. I don't know... I like it here. Whatever. So yeah, because they'd already got in, we asked why. No, wait. We ask him why... What's your name? - What? - Your name? Hold on... Look, I don't want to talk, I'm tired, so... You want to talk with someone else, go ahead. - You're on the phone. - So what? - Then you do want to talk. - Yes, but I'm on the phone! To a girlfriend? Seriously. It's important as well. Hello? Yeah. So we ask him why and he says: "You don't fit the vibe in there tonight." Yeah, the others came back out because we couldn't get in. Hey! What are you doing? Did you just take a photo? No? Show me! I saw you. You took a photo. Go on, show me. Delete it. Delete it! Come on, I'm not joking! Who do you think you are? Delete the fucking photo! Go on... Answer it. She must be worried. Tickets please. I don't have one. Have you got one? Let's say we're together. Hello. Tickets please. Thank you. - Are you traveling together? - No. - Is there a problem? - No. - Can I see your ticket? - I don't have one. No ticket. Can I see your I.D. card? I'm waiting for a new one. Can you remove your... A driving license maybe? I need to see some I.D. to issue the fine. I don't have an address, I'm on the street. I see. No address and no I.D. So what now? Next time, make sure you buy a ticket, OK? - Have a nice day. - Thanks. RASCAL I'll see you soon. Yeah, me too. Bye. Can I borrow that? My battery is flat, I just got out of prison. Well, not really. Just to make one quick call? - I don't know you. - Take my bag as a deposit. There you go. Thanks. I have a bag! Fuck it! - Thanks. - It's mine. - Then here. - You're welcome. Can I get my bag? See? Nothing to be scared of. - I'm gonna buy smokes. Want some? - Sure. - You want anything, guys? - Your mother! - Fleur! - I'll be right back! - Is he your boyfriend? - Sort of. - I'm a few cents short. - You've got a nerve! Times are hard. - Your beer. Is 40% enough? - Thanks. Are you looking at my girl? What? - I said stop looking at her! - I wasn't! Are you nuts? You haven't stopped looking at her. Bullshit, man! Chill out! You getting fresh now? I'll kick your ass. Take it easy. - You haven't stopped looking! - Bullshit! Seriously though, you think she's hot, is that it? - Chill out. - Is that it? I swear I didn't look at her. I swear on my life. Why swear? If you didn't do it? I swear I wasn't looking at her. Was I looking at you? Thank you. - Ask her! - Isn't she pretty enough for you? - Are you kidding me? - So she's ugly now? I was just looking around. Look, I wasn't looking at your girl! - So you think she's ugly? - No, she's not ugly! - You know why you lost? - No, I don't. You lost again. Bastard! There's no way out of it. Who wants to try? Who's up for it? I'm on a roll, come on! - Sit down. - Seriously? Nobody? Bunch of pussies. Come on, please. I'll play. Who are you? OK, come over here. "Jean-Michel, forty years old." I guess we can talk with people from another age group. From another decade, another century. - What's your name? - My name's Djé. You got the rules? - I can't say "no". - Exactly! You just lost! OK, I'm just kidding. Whenever you're ready. OK, but one thing... You're playing with me. You were staring at her. Yeah, I think she's pretty. Very pretty. Get this guy! You stare and then say she's pretty. Aren't you scared? Scared of you, with your blowjob lips and frizzy hair? - What? - Didn't you hear? - No, I didn't hear. - Ah, you said "no". Cheers! Do I win a kiss with your girl? No, you just won the chance to hang with us and to chat, but don't push me. - Guys, let not argue. - We're not. We're just enjoying life, looking at pretty girls. Sometimes, you just can't help looking. Did you just come over here to diss us? I should fuck you up. Get lost. If I can keep looking, fuck me all you want. "Fuck you up", not fuck you! - Is he really your boyfriend? - No, not at all. - You wanna walk a bit with me? - I don't live near here. It's OK, I'll walk you. No, I live with my dad. - And? - You want to meet my dad? Yeah, why not? - We're going now! - OK, coming. Another time. Will you remember? 06 66 05... - Good night. - Good night. Cool! You made a new friend. When can we meet? What are you doing Saturday? A WOMAN WAS BEATEN, RAPED OR KILLED HERE. Police, open up! Open the door or we'll knock it down! OK, I'm coming! He's a friend. You asshole! You had me worried. Come in. I've got some coffee on. - When did you get out? - This morning. Well, yesterday. I spoke with my boss and told him you were getting out. He might have work for you. That would be cool, wouldn't it? Coffee's almost ready. Sorry about the mess. Where's my watch? - You leaving already? - I'm sorry. I can't be late. Look at the time. But it's OK. There's food in there. A towel in the bathroom. Make yourself at home. - Bueno, amigo. Good to see you. - Yeah. I mean it! I'll see you tonight. The keys. I'll leave you mine. ¡Toma! See you later! I saw your mattress was spotless. Don't you ever fuck? Not at the moment, no. What about that girl you mentioned? She just left one day. No note, no explanation. - Didn't you call her? - What for? - Miguel! - Why would I insist? Look at this place. Look at me. She was hoping for better. It's obvious. That number you gave me wasn't right. - Really? - Yeah. I ended up sleeping outside, thanks a lot. What does that say? 45, 32, 17... Thirty-seven! - No. - Seven. That's a 7. - No, it's a 2. - It's a 7. I should know, I wrote it. Whatever. Reminds me of a joke I heard about a number like that. Let's hear it. - I can't remember the end. - It'll come to you. You'll remember it. - The beginning? - Yeah, go on. Here goes. It's about a guy who goes to a job interview. He arrives on time, all suited and booted. The secretary hands him a piece of paper with a number 50 on it. He goes into a waiting room and sees 50 other guys all suited and booted like him. They all have a piece of paper. Every time the secretary calls a number, one of them gets up and disappears behind a big yellow door. The guy knows he's going to be last, so he waits. One hour, two hours... He's getting sick of waiting and then he notices something: Guys go in, but they don't come back out. Never. And what's weird is that every time the door closes, he hears screaming, as if someone's getting butchered. It sounds totally crazy. What happens next? I can't remember the end. Miguel! Don't tell a joke if you don't know the end. You insisted! I can't invent the ending if I don't know it. You're fucking mental. Don't you dare ask? What? - You want to sleep here. - Sure, thanks. Then say so. ¡Payaso! Look at this place, look at you. I could do better too! Yeah, right! I spoke to my boss. But if you wanna work with me, it's work, work and only work! - You can't mess up. - I won't. - I don't wanna look stupid. - I promise. How are you for money anyway? And you? Nothing but trouble lately. Someone broke into my car. Really? When? Last night in the car park. - Shit! What did they take? - Nothing! They just broke in and slept inside. And now it stinks of B.O.! 200 cars in the car park, they had to choose mine! Unlucky. Alain, I've got a good one. I'm amazed by your cunning stunt. "Amazed by your cunning stunt"? Morning! - Hello, Alain! - Hello. "Amazed by..." I'm amazed by your stunning cunt? That's a good one! Hey, do you remember I told you about a friend of mine? This is him. Djé. He just got out. Come. Can you leave us? - What'll it be, Miguel? - A red wine. Miguel's a good guy. The dagos are grafters. If only all my men were like him. So what are you? What? - What are you? - What am I? A wop, a polak? Are you legal? - Hello. - Hello. French. Why didn't you say? Put it away before it gets nicked. A coffee, please. Thanks. Can you do an 8/2 split? - Can you do an 8/2 split? - What? - You ever worked on a site before? - No. What can you do? Everything. Forklifts, handling... And I can always learn. - Not afraid of scaffolds? - No. - Vertigo? - No. Miss! - Yes, I'm talking to you. - What did I do? You're bothering a customer and begging in my bar. I needed a tampon. There's a pharmacy on the corner. Take your ass over there. And put that dog on a lead! - Is your wife on a lead? - What? Is your wife on a lead? Neither is my dog! - You finished? - Nope! - Yes, you are. - I'm just starting. Leave it. She's got the painters in. Pardon? She's got what? Excuse me? "The painters"? - You mean my period? - Forget it. Enlighten me. I'm listening. Have a period on me. That's disgusting! - What's the problem? - OK, out! - Why? - Get out! He can joke about my period, but that's disgusting? Please. We're working here. If guys bled out of their dicks once a month you'd be so proud! But for women it's disgusting? Come on, out! I'm not leaving. I'm drinking my coffee. Not thirsty anymore? You get a limp dick after 45. Anyone hassle you? I'll use my money for tampons. Thank you, miss. - Ballsy! - Take that away! - I'm not touching it. - Take it away. In Spain, we say caliente. I'm going out. - Where to? - I have some stuff to do. What stuff? Stuff, you know. The girl you were texting? Djé, I'm warning you. Stay out of trouble! No, it's cool, she asked me. I'm not going to do anything. - And work tomorrow? - I'll be there, I promise. - Hello. - Hello. - Which floor? - Six. Are you going to six as well? You need a hand? No, it's alright. Do you live here? You can't get in. Yes, I can. Julien, can you open the door? There's nobody home. OK, Mum, I was in the toilet. - So this is your dad's place? - Yeah. You don't want a flat? I like it here. - You have the easy life. - Oh, yeah? What life do you have? In other people's homes? - Is he nice to you? - My dad? He's OK. Why do you ask? Don't you have one? Can you take the condom with you? He'll be back soon. He's coming back now? I don't know when exactly, but soon. You need to go. But thanks, it was cool. No time for a shower? Yes, but be quick. I can't say no, you're homeless. - Thank you. - I'm generous. Here. Do you often bring guys back? - What do you care? - I do. I dunno, I thought I was the first. But actually... Do you fuck white women? - No, seriously! - Sure. You're lucky. I can't get any. I try, but I get knocked back, every time. They're not interested. - It's like they smell me coming. - He's crazy. It's the smell. It's the smell, trust me. When you fuck, you sweat. You sweat, you drip. You drip. Of course, it stinks. They don't dig the smell of brothers! It's not racist, it's a fact. - Nobody likes the smell of sweat! - I do. I dig the smell of white chicks. They smell so good, bro! I could have them all day, morning, noon and night. - I love them bitches! - The guy's crazy! - Any woman? - Long as she's white! OK, let's see... Even her? That's not fair! I can't do all the white women! That one over there. That's what I'm talking about! She's a bit young. Women are like dogs, once they're past 20, it's over. How about the girl by the tree? Over there? Are you crazy? I'm not a paedo. She's a kid. He's nuts, bro! So a white woman between 18 and 20? That's tough! If we're talking sexual maturity, it's between 15 and 20. Get outta here! That leaves me some leeway, to avoid prison. Hey. How you doing? Pass me some of that, please. Do you like it? Yeah, a lot. But I've seen it before. I like the statues upstairs. - The sculptures? - Yeah, the sculptures. This is Street Art. It's nice, but upstairs is... magnificent. Have a nice day! Can't you stay a while? You know art, I don't know anyone here. No, I'm sorry. I have to go. DISHWASHING LIQUID, MILK, COFFEE COLA - It cracked me up. - You're funny. All right? Get lost! - I told you to beat it! - What's your problem? It's not your bar! - What is it? - They just kicked us out. - Wait, I know you! - You know him? You don't remember me? - At the station, with Fleur! - No. You're a paedo. You kissed her, didn't you? You gonna give me cigarettes too? Not even a little smile or a wink? You kiss little girls. Aren't you ashamed? - Can't you talk? - Your breath stinks. Take it easy. I love your look, man. I love the shoes. He's got style. Nice belt... It's all nice. The jacket, everything. You dress real nice. I like it. - Let's go. - I love guys like this. - The jacket... - He's in love. I love it. The braces. He's got style! I like everything except your ugly fucking face. At least I'm not a nigger! Son of a bitch! Let's get them! Come back! Djé! Come on, man, get up. Hurry up, I'm closing. - Can't I just stay here? - No. Go somewhere else. Hurry up. Take your things. - Good evening, sir. - Hello. - Can we help you? - No, I'm fine. - Do you have somewhere to sleep? - Yeah, I'm not homeless. - OK, you have a good night, sir. - Good night. - I'm meeting someone. - OK, that's fine. You think I'm a tramp? - Not at all, sir. - Yeah, right. Have a good night. Hello! Come here for a moment. - You forgot your coffee. - I didn't order a coffee. It's on me. - Good evening. - Hello. I like your stuff. Thanks. - So you're SBAM? - Yeah. Is it your real name? No. What does it mean? "Smile, Bonjour" "Au revoir, Merci". First thing they teach you as a checkout girl. - You wanna try? - Yeah, OK. - Where? - Over there. Do a peace sign, or an anarchy sign, whatever. You have to get quite close. You've a lot to learn. - What sort of trouble? - A fight with a skinhead. He insulted my friend. I hit him with a right. - Knocked him out. - He deserved it. - Did he get up? - Dunno, I ran. It's funny, you don't look like a guy who fights in bars. Want some gum? That's disgusting! It's nicotine gum. To stop smoking. Nasty, isn't it? I'm hooked on it now. This is it. DO NOT TOUCH You can sleep here. - Good night then. - Thanks. Don't put your bag there, it's full of bedbugs. Hello. Are you looking for any help? Thanks. Hello, are you looking for anybody? - To do what? - Help with the work. I could use the help but I can't pay you. - I'm looking for work. - Work? - Plenty around here. - There are jobs everywhere. Hey! That guy there. He's not friendly, but he's hiring. OK, thanks. Hello, I heard you were hiring. - Do you have I.D.? - Yeah. I'm a French citizen. - French? - Yeah. It's expired. I don't want any trouble. I'm just looking for work. Put them with the others. I'll be right back. You're a nosey one. Here, this is for you. You want to try her? Special offer. Damaged goods. So what will it be? The girl? I've had enough of these bloody anarchists! We don't need them and their two-bit slogans. Come on, Luna, let's go! Let's get out of here. Let's go! Off we go! - Hello. - Hi. Hello. I'm looking for SBAM. - Over there. - OK, thanks. She's the best, but she gets a shitty movie. All the other superheroes get cool films. - There you are. - I was at work. - I wondered where you were. - I bought groceries. That's nice of you. Do you know where you'll go? Not yet. You could go back where you came from. - Shut up! - I'm just saying. - What's your name? - Djé. - What's yours? - Maya. Your turn. Introduce yourself to the newcomer. Coffee? - Coffee? - Yeah. Thanks. - What are you doing this afternoon? - I dunno. - No. We've got enough people. - Why? We've got enough, SBAM. We don't need more. - He can help us. - I don't even know him. - I don't want to disturb. - It's OK. - Here. - Thanks. Sit. Move over, Gaïa. - What's this afternoon? - Nothing. We're going shopping. - Nothing. - In style! Your three packs of noodles won't go far. - Don't be a dick! - What? Yeah, it's nice of him. "Nice". - Maya thinks it's nice. - You wanna say hello? Go say hello to Djé. Come here. She doesn't care! We'll be quick. Hello! Ladies and gentlemen, my friends and I invite you to take part in a militant action. Don't worry, this isn't a hold-up, we won't touch the cash or your belongings. We're just requisitioning some essential items for people who unfortunately can't afford them. This is what we want. Not this one. Look. - Palm oil. - Then don't take it. Stop! - Take it. - It's good. Taste the hazelnuts? That's crap. Take the good stuff. Grab some salmon, that's good. Take loads. - You can help us! - Is that essential? Do you have a shit life? You can help us! Meat, pizzas, anything we can share! Grab some steaks! - Organic. SBAM likes organic. - I don't see any. Hold this for me. Oil. Check! Salt. Check! Shit! Come on, let's go! - Come on, Maya! - Wait up! Run for it, guys! Not that way! Maya, this way! Let's go! Come on! - What are you doing? - Help me. Put your hands behind your back. Pretend! Quickly. I'm on the force. There's two inside. OK, thanks. Hurry up! Come on, in here! Fuck! I'm too old for this. "I'm on the force"? I always wanted to say that. What? - Where's the pastis? - I want the cereal. Where is it? - She only took fruit. - No, it's here. Where's the chocolate? I thought he was gonna hit me. I know, that's why you need to be careful sometimes. Here, the basic principal is sharing. Everything we took today, we share. You want something, you take it. You want something, you take it. That's good! You can't live without money. OK, we need a minimum amount of money. But what we want is to borrow things. You need something, you need a car, ask the abbot, he has one. You need clothes, shoes or a sweater, ask Akram, he gets clothes for us. He gets them from charities, so he won't charge you. You want jeans, he'll give you some. But when stuff's free, people get greedy. Say I wanna take ten pairs of jeans, what then? Why take ten? - Because I'm an asshole. - No, it's different if it's free. In a restaurant, which two things are free? Tell me. Gaïa, come here! The bread and the water is free. Right? Bread and water. You eat your bread and get more when you need it. You don't order three baskets. Same with water. You don't order three jugs. You take only what you need. Same with jeans, you only need one pair a day. - Clever. - I know! "Only what you need!" I came up with that. Wait. Hey, Maya! Guys, listen to this. When I was 16, I worked in a poultry factory. There was a guy there... Is it a funny story? He only had one tooth, so we called him "Toothy". His job... Maya! Was to cut the chickens' heads off. All day long, cutting chickens' heads off. He cut chickens' heads off all day! As a result, he had these blisters filled with pus! And blood... Bon appétit! I'm eating here! It leaked through his gloves, and he was grabbing chickens. Like zero hygiene! Wait, there's more! - He'd been... Maya! - I'm listening. He'd been doing it for so long that he had no fingerprints left. - Isn't that fucking crazy? - Oh, my God! What a story, Akram! - It's a great story. - Amazing! Don't laugh, Maya, it's a true story. The cops make him do this, no prints. He's a genius. Can't trace him. If the cops get him to do this... - No prints! - Nothing. - No results. - Zero. - That's amazing, Akram. - It's crazy. Punchline needs a bit of work. - Are you funny? - No. You look funny. Make us laugh. Go on. You want me to tell you a joke? Yeah, I want a story that's funny and true. We're listening. OK, I've got one. I was... Sorry. I was on the street, just a normal night, and there's this old guy, really ugly looking. Not like you, just the opposite. - I'm just kidding. - You're a traitor! You think he's funny? The guy walks over to me, and just stands there, staring at me with eyes like a dead fish. You know what he said? "I lost my bag. 51, Rue d'Arbalète." What did he say? "I lost my bag. 51, Rue d'Arbalète." - Polish. - I got that. - You don't like my accent? - It's perfect. - Shall I finish? - Carry on. The guy says it again: "I lost my bag. 51, Rue d'Arbalète." I thought his eyes were gonna pop out. I said: "Take it easy." Then he came even closer. His breath was so bad, I wanted to puke. "I lost my bag!" "51, Rue d'Arbalète!" Like that, 20 times, over and over. I said: "I didn't take it so leave me alone." He stared at me for three seconds. Know what he did? He grabbed me like this. With a knife to my neck like this. Careful! I said: "What are you doing?" Do you know what he said? "I lost my bag! 51, Rue d'Arbalète." - Excuse me. - No problem. My joke didn't hurt you. True. But mine made her laugh. The cops again! - A raid? - Another? Ever damn night! Let's go down. Are you staying? Yeah, to watch. I meant here in the squat? I dunno. - They're dying to kick us out. - But can they? They will eventually. - What's so funny? - I normally run when I see cops. I know who you are. I know. Who am I? You're one of us, brother! Relax! - Coffee at this time of night? - Yeah. I like it, it tastes different at night. Reminds me of uni. - Are you a student? - I was. Gaïa, get down. Go on. - Let her go. - Nope. I was studying sociology. - You know any? - No. I'm not surprised. Christine Delphy, Bourdieu, Durkheim, the role of the individual... It goes right over your head? I love it. What's Djé short for? Djéremy or Dgérard? Cheeky! Is Maya your real name? Yeah. Of course. Gaïa, get down. Come on, down! She was happy with me. Make some room. What's that? Sticking out? Is it a real key? What does it open? It was my house key. I got kicked out when I was 15 for getting into trouble. I kept it because it was all I had on me. A souvenir! Didn't they change the locks? Sleep, if you want. Don't mind me! - No, I just like it here. - You can sleep here. - I want to sleep with you. - No. You mean you want to have sex with me. I want to have sex with lots of girls, but there's only one I want to sleep with. That story about the key, is it true or just some sad story you tell everyone? In my bag. In my bag. This? - What's this for? - Stop being nosey. - I stole them earlier. - As in "We'll definitely fuck"? As in "If we fuck, we'll definitely need them." LADIES, DON'T WALK HOME ALONE AT NIGHT. TAKE A TAXI. STAY SAFE. AVOID DARK STREETS. IF YOU ARE FOLLOWED, REPORT IT. I can't take any more of that guy. Can I have that? - Which guy? - The perv with the glasses. Bald prick keeps giving me orders. And he's a total misogynist. He walked into the office earlier, he didn't see me and said: "Where did that bitch leave the file?" "Pardon?" Then he's like: "Maya, I didn't see you. I wasn't talking about you." "Or, maybe I was, who knows?" - Is that funny? - He said that? Maya, we're waiting. - Yeah, she's coming! - I'm coming. But I'm not coming back tomorrow. I'll find something else. Do me a favour. Go and beat him up. - Beat him up. - Seriously? Punch him in the mouth. You'll be doing the world a favour. - Go on. - OK. I'm joking. Are you nuts? - I'll do it. - No, forget it. - Where's your pen? - In my pocket. Why? Here. - Was that me? - I don't know. It was pretty hot! - Don't look. - I'm not. It's a surprise. Shit. Stop it! I knew you were looking! I'm going back in. Don't forget the cool box. - See you tonight. - See you tonight. Are you sure? Yeah. Go ahead and lie down. I'll have to wash that off, do a clean design, then the tattoo. There's someone down there. Good evening, would you like a tea or a coffee? Fuck you! What? No problem. Have a good evening. - What did he say? - I don't know, better not to ask. - Have you been doing this long? - Yeah. - Did you start with Akram? - Yeah, he got me into it. You want to know if I went out with him? I didn't say that! I could have, he's good-looking. But I had decided to calm down a bit. What does that mean? It means that... I'd screwed a lot of guys and I'd had enough. - A lot? - Yeah, quite a lot. I've never had a boyfriend. Maybe 10 or 15 per year. - That's a lot! - No. I started when I was fourteen, I'm 26 now. Work it out. Are you coming? Are you actually working it out? Come on. Fuck. You want me to say it'll be different with you? Maybe it will be. We'll see. What's that? Is it real? Why did you do that? You have a problem. You're in love already? We're working. There's someone here. Good evening, Chantal. Social aid volunteers. It's Maya. This is Djé. Good evening. - Are you OK? - Not bad. - Something to eat or drink? - Yeah, a bite to eat. Do you have any left? I got you something. - Something stupid? - No, it's a gift. - What is it? - Close your eyes. Here. Which hand? I knew it. Why are you giving me this? - Don't you like it? - Yes, it's pretty. Where did you get it? - It's rude to ask. - Is it? Tell me where you got it. - It's a secret. - Yeah? Who's Lisa? It has Lisa engraved on it. Whose is it? - How did you get it? - I stole it. You're giving me a stolen ring? And you just shrug? - When was it? - A long time ago. Who is she? I dunno, just some woman! Don't you like it? It's not that! If it's stolen, I don't want it. - How do you steal a ring anyway? - I don't know. Forget it. Don't wear it. - It's somebody else's! - It's yours now. I don't want it. - You don't? Then give it back. - Here! Next time, don't offer me a stolen ring. There won't be a next time. Are you for real? I think those are cops behind us. The bastards have been tailing us for five minutes. There's nobody there. I can't get stopped, the scooter's not legal. Take it easy. If they turn, you jump off. - I'll lose them. - They've gone, look. That's them! Don't look round, just get off. I can't. - Get off! - I can't! Go! New! Get off, fuck! Quick! That's it, keep on them. Keep going, you can go around the block. Fuck it! - Are you sure? - That's it. - Where are they? - Hurry up! There they are! Go on, faster! Stay on them! Quick. Freeze! Easy, easy! Were you having fun? Why didn't you stop? You're hurting me! I was scared! - Is that your scooter? - Yes, it's mine! Then why run? Are you armed? You're hurting me! - Your I.D.! - I don't have it, it's at home. You don't have a home! Turn around! Do you have your I.D.? You're hurting me! Where are you from? You're breaking my arm! - Where are you from? - Armenia! - Finally! - I'm Armenian, you fucker! Like Aznavour! We love Charles Aznavour! I can't breathe! Shut your mouth! - What's yours, Lisa? - French. - Where from? - Vitry-le-François. In Champagne! A Champenois and an Armenian. Who would have thought it? An unlikely partnership. - I'll run a check on this. - Yeah, see if he's clean. Like a pair of odd socks! Like Timon and Pumbaa! We can discuss Disney at the station. Have a chat about cartoons. Take me along to the station house! Take me along to the station house... Is he OK? Call an ambulance! Why don't you try to escape? The longer you stay, the more likely you'll get caught. You could hitch-hike. Or steal a car. They won't have blocked the roads. I can lend you mine, if you want. What's your name? I'm Camille, I'm 28 years old, I work in a bookshop. We're doing an inventory today, so I need to be there in an hour. My boyfriend works nights. He usually calls me before he goes to sleep. He sometimes comes here too. If I don't answer, he'll get worried. He lives nearby. He has a key. You can still leave. You haven't done anything. I think it's a mistake to stay here. Try to escape. It's not too late, you know. I know, because my dad's a policeman. Shut the fuck up! I don't care about your life. You have a nice flat. I like it. Thank you. It's big. But it's hot in here. Aren't you hot? Let's have ourselves a little drink. - Is it over here? - Yeah, on the bar. - You want one? - I'm fine, thanks. What are you thinking? You think I chose you? Because you're special? No, it was pure chance. You're not special, you're ordinary. What are you afraid of? That I'll rape you? Or that I'll kill you? That's not the worst part. The worst part is neither. It's what comes before. Help! Help me! That man! Quick, call the police! That man who's running away! Police! Freeze! On the ground! Now! Code 803, guys! Hands behind your head! Why did you come back? Yeah, it's definitely him. - Suspect is in handcuffs. - Bring him in. Easy! - Let's take him in. - Search his pockets. Get him in the car. Let's go. Let's go.
