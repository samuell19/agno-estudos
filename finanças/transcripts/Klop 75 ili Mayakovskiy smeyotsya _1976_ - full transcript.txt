Kazakova An Experimental Artistic Synthesis with the participation of Soyuzmultfilm studio SCREENPLAY WRITER ALEXEY KAPLER Hello, comrades. First of all, I want to explain to you why I am standing here. I was invited by my friends, directors Sergey Yutkevich and Anatoliy Karanovich, to take part in this film as, well, let's say, a witness, a contemporary of Mayakovsky. Today, when monuments are erected in honor of Mayakovsky, when they study Mayakovsky in schools, or rather, they "cover" Mayakovsky, it's very difficult to imagine what the poet was during his lifetime, what kind of storms raged around him. It seems I can still hear this... this storm at the Polytechnic Museum, this howling and roaring of his enemies, the shouts of his friends when he performed. Mayakovsky was fearless, he took the blows and hit back outright. We, young people, loved him infinitely. He was our standard. When the directors and I were negotiating my participation in this film, I asked them: "Very well, but what if I don't like something in your film, do I have the right to say this to the audience or should I praise everything?" They answered: "Say whatever you like". And so, we came to terms. That's how I found myself in this pavilion of the film studio, which has everything one needs to create a film's image and sound. Looking around, here you can see the lighting equipment, microphones and the shooting equipment. And at the top you can see something that looks like a captain's cabin, this is the place for sound engineers. So if you hear me badly now, it's their fault. In short, here you are surrounded by film equipment which in the days of Mayakovsky you couldn't even dream of. The main character of this film is the embodiment of the petty bourgeoisie - Prisypkin, or Pierre Skripkin, as he elegantly renamed himself. Mayakovsky saw in the petty bourgeoisie his mortal enemy. and he fought against it with the full force of his genius. Of course, we understand that now there's nothing to fight against and there's no need for that because the petty bourgeoisie is over forever. There is none of it left. Well, maybe just barely noticeable manifestations. Some car will rush along the street, all decked out in colored ribbons, and balloons, and with a baby doll atop the radiator, and in this car sits a pompous Prisypkin with a girl in a white veil. Doesn't Prisypkin want an elegant life? Doesn't he want a prestigious car and contacts with celebrities? To be serious, there are much more dangerous manifestations of petty bourgeois, of "Prisypkinism". Because Prisypkin is the same classic character as Tartuffe, Khlestakov or Rasplyuyev, for example. I want to tell you, comrades, not to be surprised that in this film alongside the live actors you will see puppets, animation, all this mixed together. This is an experimental film. Mayakovsky once said: "The main thing depends on the breadth of the director's vision". Our directors' vision was broad indeed. Well, we'll see what will come of it. Now let's get acquainted with the actors. The actor invited to the role of Prisypkin is completely new to cinema. He worked for a variety show studio. He was never filmed, and to find out how suitable he'd be for this role, we made a screen test, based on Mayakovsky's script "Forget About the Fireplace". Let's see this screen test. Hey you, giver of enemas! Write me a sick leave. But you're not sick. Aren't I? You're absolutely healthy. Healthy? It's ticklish. Tomorrow I'll be sick. I'm always sick the day after payday. Comrade doctor, close your health centre, we're all going to the community work day. And you - pay the "Russian Autoroads" membership fee. You haven't paid for six months. Haven't I? And what is this? International Red Aid - paid! Russian Red Cross - paid! "Down With Illiteracy"... "Down With Illiteracy"... Here you are! Not enough for you, huh? The "Russian Autoroads"! You won't get anything! You're snakes! You're flayers! You're pilfering my wage: "Put it all on the table!" Don't you touch me, Why should I pay these fees? What did I fight for? What did I fight for? What did I fight for? Who goddamn knows! If you're responsible, this and that, Then you have to pay for everything. Oh, no, my dear, look for another fool! I'll say, "Good luck", and then be off. I'll say, "Good luck", and then be off. They will pounce on me and begin to embarrass me. Well, bugger them all, they're nothing to me. It's not the 19th year, I can indulge myself. I'll get what I...! I'll get what I...! I'll get what I fought for! We march together, shoulder to shoulder. We build roads, but what have I to do with it? Oh, no, my dear, look for another fool! I'll say, "Good luck", and then be off. I'll say, "Good luck", and then be off. What do you think? I think this is a suitable candidate. This actor's name is Yuri Chernov. Let me introduce him to you. Gee! And where is Chernov? Chernov is not there, he's late again. Again? He's always late! - I'll find him. - Okay. You know, comrades, we could re-shoot this scene with Chernov, but I'd like to show you... Hello! Sorry, I'm late. But it's not my fault. Our concert was far away and we had problems with transport. You should apologize not to me, but to Iya Sergeyevna Savvina. She always comes on time and you made her wait. Let's get acquainted. I'll be your partner in this film. I'll play the role of Zoya Beryozkina, and in the course of the plot, I'll have to fall in love with you. Thank you. Oh, sorry... I'm Yura. Attention, get ready for the dubbing of the episode "Dorm"! It seems I forgot the text at home. I have a lot of concerts, so I forgot about it. But I remember the musical parts! It's okay, I'll help you. This episode exactly follows the text of the play. You should remember that play. We covered Mayakovsky at school, but not "The Bedbug". But I studied "The Bedbug", Alexey Yakovlevich. But I have a question. At the very beginning of the play, Zoya Beryozkina appears only for a moment, and I, as an actress, don't have time to understand about the nuances of the relationships between Zoya and Prisypkin. Where did they meet? How did they spend their time? Where does Zoya work? Mayakovsky the journalist will answer these questions better than me. He wrote "The Bedbug" using newspapers materials. And he has one saying: "Together with me, this play was written by the Komsomol and 'Komsomolskaya Pravda'". I suggest you to take advantage of your actor's imagination and imagine yourself as Zoya Beryozkina in that distant epoch. KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA [COMMUNIST YOUTH LEAGUE TRUTH] GO FORWARD MORE CONFIDENTLY, COMRADES! Worker Prisypkin [sleepybones] calls himself Pierre Skripkin. He met artists who said he looked like Harry Piel. After that, he began to go to the movies more often. He grew side burns. And, wanting to keep the beau monde, barely washed himself for a month. LASSALLE PLANT Everybody to the community work day! SUMMER CLUB TODAY AT THE CLUB Report on the international situation And after - LIVING NEWSPAPER of the "BLUE BLOUSE" trade union council. TODAY IN CINEMA: Harry Piel's "Der Mann ohne Nerven" And yet, I can't understand. I can't understand. She is a Komsomol member, a young girl. And she fell in love with this Prisypkin? It's unbelievable. Zoya was young, naive. And he had a powerful instrument of seduction - a guitar. Mayakovsky hated vulgar things, and he called people like Prisypkin "romance-voiced" ones. Mayakovsky mocked the popular romance called "Forget About the Fireplace". So he gave one of his scripts the same name. I did learn the romance of Prisypkin. May I sing it? The moon hid behind a cloud - It again goes out for a walk. Let me put your white-white hand To my red heart. My feelings, dreams and fantasies Were again lit up in my heart like a flame, - In my battles with the world bourgeoisie, I earned a private life for myself. He left her after Fifteen days of use, Because she didn't have Enameled leather shoes. --Mayakovsky When you put, so trustingly, Your little fingers into my palm, You can't even imagine That you put them into a fire. It's impossible to live without tenderness, It's easy to ruin this tenderness. Let me love your black-black eyes With my ruby-red soul. - Why so late? - Hi! - Are you all set? - Yes. My boys are in a hurry, so let's start. But we first need to film the "Dorm" episode. Baby, we need to mount everything. Stop, stop, stop! Forgive me, comrades, but I have to stop the action, because there are two new and very important characters. One of them is Bochkin, who chose the pseudonym Oleg Bayan. He's a rascal, the ideologist of Prisypkin, his "home-bred Mephistopheles". A preacher of the temptations of the elegant life. By the way, after the play "The Bedbug" appeared, there was a scandal around Bayan's name. The fact is that then there was one real character, I knew him personally, he was a literary plagiarist and a fake poet. His name was Vadim Bayan. Of course, this was also a pseudonym. He was really named Sidorov. So, this Sidorov accused Mayakovsky of the charge that Mayakovsky insulted his person. He said that Oleg Bayan in "The Bedbug" had a lot of "parallels and common features" with him. Mayakovsky replied: "If you don't like it, change your name". This "Bochkin-Bayan" is played by Leonid Sergeyevich Bronevoy. To be precise, he plays two roles: He plays Oleg Bayan from the "New Economic Policy" era and the modern mediocre actor Bochkin. Galina Borisovna Volchek also plays two roles. At first she plays Madame Renaissance, the future mother-in-law of Prisypkin. from the "New Economic Policy" era. And then she plays a mediocre actress who performs with Bochkin. They both voice themselves. They voice their animated drawings, because cinema has learned how to give life to drawings, but the drawings can't speak with human voices themselves yet, even now, in the era of the scientific and technological revolution. I apologize to the actors for interrupting their acting, and I ask them to start the scene from the beginning. Why so late? Look at the clock! - Hi! Are you all set? - Yes. Okay, my boys are in a hurry, so let's start. No, we first need to film the "Dorm" episode. Baby, we need to mount everything. The boys today have two more gigs. So these puppeteers will wait. Give me the sheet music, baby! Faster! Faster! Come on! Come on! Instruments in order! Tempo! Tempo! What about you? Warm up! I'll start... Good, just not so loud. I'll start the test. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5! Ma-ma! Ma-ma-mua! 1, 2, 3, 4! Okay... Attention, everyone get ready for dubbing the animated episode "NEP"! Complete silence! Attention! Instrument room! Projection! Action! For the upcoming wedding Prisypkin and Bayan are making purchases using the money of Madam Renaissance. You will find here everything you want: All you want for drinking or for comfort. Here, the old world is ready to give itself up For the new Soviet currency. Oleg Bayan will arrange everything just like in Paris, Oleg Bayan advises you with good intent: Grab the piece that lies closer to you, So that nobody grabs it before you. Wait till you're my age, my dear. They will deceive you many times - Ask Madame Renaissance about it - Because there are all sorts of crooks at this place! All around is wonderful private trade, This is fair trade, who will beat whom? We don't need much from friends or family - No, we don't need too much! Sometimes there are militia raids, But each of us has a license. We are modest people and if you pay, We'll sell you everything, everything! Ah, those private sellers - they are all crooks, You won't even notice how they will deceive you. Trade without rest, hike the price threefold, As long as they pay, as long as they pay! And in this beautiful crush You can see very clearly The death throes of the class That has something to lose. Has something to lose! Lampshades! Lampshades! Lampshades of any color and type. Blue ones for comfort, Red ones for passion. "Coty" perfume by the ounce! "Coty" perfume by the ounce. "Coty" perfume by the ounce. Fur-lined brassieres! Fur-lined brassieres! Oh! Look at those aristocratic bonnets! They're not bonnets! They're... Do you think I'm blind? Suppose we have twins? There'll be one for Dorothy, and one for Lillian. I've already decided to give them aristocratic-cinematic names... They will go out together like that! Yes! Buy them, Rosalia Pavlovna. Comrade Skripkin... Don't call me comrade! You're not a proletarian yet - not till after the marriage! Buy them, buy them, Rosalia Pavlovna. He doesn't mean to be vulgar. Here he is, bringing an immaculate proletarian origin and a union card into your family and you count your rubles! You shouldn't get married because of a button! You shouldn't get divorced because of a button! Just press your thumb against your index finger And you won't ever lose your pants, citizens! Dutch press studs! They sew themselves on! Twenty kopeks for half a dozen! Here you are, monsieurs! Buy them, Rosalia Pavlovna. In our Red family there must be no petty bourgeois squabbles over pant malfunctions. And Comrade Prisypkin's pants must be like a horn of plenty... He is the victorious class and he sweeps away everything in his path, like lava! Allow me to deliver it at no extra charge. The best republican herrings! Indispensable with every kind of vodka! Yes! Salted herrings! Now that's something for the wedding, I'll sure take some of them. How much is this sprat? This salmon costs two-sixty per kilo. Two-sixty for this overgrown minnow? Only two-sixty for this budding sturgeon! For these marinated fish bones? For this real whale! Two-sixty! Two-sixty for this sprat? Two-sixty! For this overgrown minnow? Two-sixty! For these marinated fish bones? Did you hear that, Comrade Skripkin? Oh, how right you were to kill the Tsar, our emperor! Oh, how right you were to drive out Mr. Ryabushinsky! I shall claim my civic rights and buy my herrings in the Soviet State Co-Op! The best republican herrings! Indispensable with every kind of vodka! Comrade Skripkin, why get mixed up with these petty bourgeois elements and haggle over herrings so quarrelsomely? Don't you worry, There's no reason to. Just give me half a liter of vodka And the tail of herring, And fifteen more rubles... Then the wedding will be a success. Yes! Comrade Bayan... I'm against all this petty bourgeois stuff - like canaries, and so on... I'm a man with higher needs. What I'm interested in is a wardrobe with a mirror... There! Whales! Whales! Whales! Dolphins! Now then, show me your snail! It's a whole tail's length longer! A whole tail's length longer! A whole tail's length longer? What did we fight for? Oh, why did we kill the Tsar, our emperor? What did we fight for? Oh, why did we throw out Mr. Ryabushinsky? Where will I find my civic rights and my herrings? This Soviet regime of yours will drive me to my grave! My dear Rosalia Pavlovna, try comparing them from the other end. It's only bigger by a head, and what do you need the head for? It's inedible. You'll cut it off and throw it out! Did you hear what he said? If I cut off your head, Comrade Bayan, it will be no loss to anyone. But if I cut off this herring's head I lose ten kopeks to the kilo! All around is wonderful private trade, This is fair trade, who will beat whom? We don't need much from friends or family - No, we don't need too much! All around is wonderful private trade, But each of us is very honest. We are modest people and if you pay, We'll sell you everything, everything! We'll sell you everything, everything! We'll sell you everything! Property. Theft. The Law... is blind. Purchase. Sale. New Economic Policy [NEP]. New Economic Policy [NEP]. New Economic Policy [NEP]. "RED HOME LIFE" DORM Attention, get ready for shooting the episode "Dorm". Action! Episode "Dorm", take one. Puppeteers, action! Where are my boots? Someone's swiped my boots again! They're here. Prisypkin took them to go see his lady-love, his she-camel. The trash he leaves behind him is kind of more refined nowadays. It used to be empty beer-bottles and fish-tails. Shut your trap! The kid buys a new tie and you curse him like he was Ramsay MacDonald. That's just what he is! The new tie don't matter. Trouble is that he's tied to the tie - not the tie to him. Friends, help me to conduct a great experiment. I use the latest techniques to fight against absenteeism! Today he quit his job. He's marrying the daughter of a barber. Now his nails will be trimmed by Mademoiselle Elzevira Renaissance. Pretty cozy! Maybe you just envy him? Do you think you're Karl Liebknecht? If someone beckons you, you surely would leave too! What a hero! This isn't 1919 any more. People want to live their own lives now. Attention, in a minute Prisypkin should noisily awake! Comrade Skripkin, don't pay attention to these rude jokes; they will only spoil the refined taste that is awakening in you. Who is this? This is his teacher, who taught him to do his hair. He now teaches young people, to write poetry and to dance... and from some, he just borrows money. You have talent, Comrade Skripkin! But what with capitalist encirclement and the building of socialism in one country you have no place to let loose! You need a world revolution, you must break through into Europe. Once you've smashed the world bourgeoisie, you will delight the Moulin Rouge and the Pantheon with the beauty of your bodily movements. The most crucial step in life is the first tango after the nuptial ceremonies - it should leave a lifelong impression! Well, take a few steps with an imaginary lady. That's right! Tread softly as if on a moonlit night, full of sadness and dreams... ...you're returning from a saloon. Oh, you are so beautiful, my tango, It's hard with people, but it's easy with you. Don't wriggle your hind-parts! You're supposed to be leading your mademoiselle, not a pushcart! I was just scratching myself. Oleg Bayan knows women, no doubt. Oleg Bayan advises you with good intent: If you want to kiss us, do it only after the engagement, And if you do this before, you'll only have yourselves to blame. Vanya, what happened? So it's over? Our love is liquidated. "We part like ships in the sea..." Van'ka, aren't you ashamed? You need to leave this woman. She's pulling your strings! Vanya, what happened? We wanted to live together! We wanted to work together! Don't interfere with my freedom of love as a citizen, otherwise I'll call the militia! ZOYA BERYOZKINA SHOT HERSELF Don't be sad, Iya Sergeevna. Zoya was clumsy in love, and just as clumsy in suicide. Therefore, in the second half of the film, you'll meet your character again. You should never forget: don't put on two ties at once - particularly if they're different colors. And remember, you can't wear a starched shirt outside your pants! Especially for a wedding. The tramcars drew up to the Registry Office, Bringing the guests to a Red marriage service. Dressed in his working clothes was the groom And a union card stuck out of his blouse! Ah, the guests are respectable and prominent, Prominent! The mother-in-law is dignified and imposing, Imposing! The bride is rosy and drunk, Drunk! But not because of wine. Let's begin, Skripochka? Wait a little more. I wish to get wed in an organized fashion - in the presence of the guests of honor, and particularly in the presence of the secretary of our factory committee, respected Comrade... Lassalchenko. There! My dear bride and bridegroom, please forgive me for being late and allow me to convey to you the congratulations of our leader, Comrade Lassalchenko. "Tomorrow, I'd even go to church." "But today is a Party meeting." "And like it or not, I have to go to the Party cell..." I hereby declare the wedding open. Comrades and Monsieurs, please eat! Where would you find pigs like these nowadays? I bought this ham three years ago in case of a war but there's still no war! And the ham is getting moldy... Please eat! Respected citizens! Beauty is the motive force of progress! What would I have been as a simple worker? "Bochkin" [Barrelman] - and nothing more. What could I do as a "Bochkin"? Moo? And nothing more. But as "Bayan" [epic bard] I can do anything. I'm glad, I'm happy, We all are happy. My friend Pierre Skripkin, Our friend, our monsieur, At this moment Having walked the path of struggle, He lost only his union card But he found so much. When we suffered being under the yoke Together with the working class, Together with Comrade Friedrich Engels, And with Comrade Marx, Could we dreamily assume Or at least assumedly dream, That self-sacrificing work, And defeated capital, would be joined in beautiful marriage? Oleg Bayan, everybody knows him, Oleg Bayan, he doesn't need to introduce himself. Oleg Bayan, such talent and charm! Pour him a glass of champagne. Oleg Bayan is drunk with happiness! Beauty is pregnant with... Pregnant? Who said "pregnant"? Watch your language in the presence of the newlyweds! A romance. "Makarov's Lament for Vera Kholodnaya". At a time when flowers are being collected, At a time when dreams come true, Tell me just one word, And you will be in my heart again, Only you. And you will be in my heart, Only you. FIRE STATION COMRADES AND CITIZENS, VODKA IS POISON DRUNKS CAN EASILY BURN UP THE REPUBLIC That's the end of the first part of the film. Everything burned down, all that elegant life. However, among the victims there was no Prisypkin. They decided that he had burned up and forgot about him. In fact, Prisypkin, along with his seven-stringed "girlfriend" was soaked by fire hoses and frozen into an icicle. You'll see for yourselves what happened next. But for now, let's divulge no more information, and look around. We're on Mayakovsky Square. A person very quickly gets used to the words. Mayakovsky Square. This is the holy place of Soviet art. Here on the right, where Tchaikovsky Hall now stands, previously, there was "TM", Theater of the famous Soviet director Meyerhold, who staged all the plays of Mayakovsky. If you look a little to the right, there used to be a circus, then a music hall, and now it's the Satire Theater, where you can watch Mayakovsky's plays today. And here, in the center of the square, there was a simple tram stop. In one direction along the Garden Ring went "the Buggy", as it was called. Tram "B". And along Gorky St., the former Tverskaya-Yamskaya St., went other trams. And there, opposite from here, was their stop. These trams had no doors so you could jump in at any time, or jump out. Trams were liberal, back then. On the Garden Ring there were trees. In fact, the entire Garden Ring was a big single... green boulevard. And on this boulevard one could often meet Mayakovsky who was going to the Meyerhold Theate for the rehearsals of his plays. Actually, it was hard to imagine Moscow without Mayakovsky, who was walking its streets. He was tall, taller than the rest. Wide-shouldered, wider than the rest. He was a handsome, very handsome man. In "The Bedbug" he wrote about the future, but even a genius can't imagine the future in all of its reality. And he couldn't imagine this Mayakovsky Square either. Nor his monument. It's known that Mayakovsky didn't like monuments. But it's not he who needs this monument, it's us. And Mayakovsky definitely couldn't imagine that there'd be a "Mayakovskaya" metro station. "Are you exiting on the 'Mayakovskaya'?" - somebody may ask as simply as he would have asked in the 1920s: "Hey, coachman, to get to Sadovo-Triumphalnaya, (i.e. the current Mayakovsky Square) how much?" The station "Mayakovskaya". Above us is the Sun, the Sun and the Sun. Rejoice, all you who are strong, Workshop of the workers who create our world. Warm us, Sun! Play, Sun! Burn, our Sun! Enthusiasm, go grow and expand! Factories, go shine iridescent! Today we are building socialism - It's alive, real, and true. Warm us, Sun! Play, Sun! Burn, our Sun! THE FUTURE GENERATION FINDS THE FROZEN PRISYPKIN AND DECIDES TO RESURRECT HIM. I've slept it off! Forgive me, comrades, I was plastered! What militia station is this? I can always prove my identity. I've got my documents with me. International Red Aid - paid. OSOAVIAKhIM - paid! "Down With Illiteracy" - here you are! And what is this? A marriage certificate... Right, I married yesterday. Where are you? Who's kissing your finger tips? There'll be hell to pay at home! Here's my union card. All my unpaid union dues! What day is today? The forms... They'll ask for the forms! Local Committee... District Committee... My God! My wife! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Where am I? Where did you put me? Highways! Highways! Coachman! The highways of the future amazed the defrozen mammal. This pure example of the petty bourgeoisie found himself in a new world. Hello! Hello! This is the President of the Institute for Human Resurrection. I want to inform you about new circumstances relating to the amazing experiment of bringing a frozen creature back to life. I'll read the resolution! Moved by sanitary-inspection stations of the metallurgical and chemical enterprises of the Donbass: In view of the danger of the spread of the bacteria of arrogance and sycophancy, we demand that the exhibit remain in its refrigerated state. A word, please! This is the opinion of the majority of the members of the Academic council of our institute. The rapid passage of time will sweep and cut away all heavy ballast, the ballast of those devastated by unbelief. The future will accept all those who have at least one trait that ties the person to the collective: the joy of work, the desire to sacrifice, the tireless urge to invent, the gift of generosity, a pride in one's humanity. Going by its external mimetic characteristics, this ressurected mammal should be classified under homo sapiens. My colleague Dr. Beryozkina is mistaken. Utilizing the method of comparative zoology, I have become convinced that we're dealing with... a most dangerous anthropoid simulant. And that this is... the most remarkable of parasites. In the not too distant time, in the mattresses of time there were always two types. They're different in size, but identical in essence: the famous bedbugus normalis and bourgeoisius vulgaris. The difference between them was only that bedbugus normalis, having gorged itself on the body of a human, fell under the bed. And bourgeoisius vulgaris having gorged itself on the body of all mankind, fell onto the bed. Give me a drink... I made you breakfast. We give this only to cosmonauts and investigators of the sea depths. Try it. It's very delicious. I don't need your breakfast! Give me a drink, please. It's good that I envisaged this relapse. Cognac "Cosmos". It gives you energy, and has the same taste as the French "Napoleon". You can drink it at work and when you're sunbathing by the sea. One hundred percent lack of alcohol. Like giving lemonade to an elephant. You ressurect me and now you make fun of me! Give me a drink! Give me a drink! Indeed, this is an amazing parasite. The dispute about his future fate engaged not only the scientists, but also me and directors of this film. There was something of a confrontation between us. The thing is that in "The Bedbug" everything ends as follows: the people of the future, that is - me and you, put this anthropoid creature into a zoo cage. And I thought that this is how this film should end. However, the directors decided to transfer Prisypkin to that world where there is an elegant life even today, and where there's a larder for people such as Skripkin and Bochkin. In response to my doubts, they cited Mayakovsky, who really did say that he would insert into the play "Facts about the philistinistic bastards of the past and the future." "Recent political and domestic news". Everyone knows who has the final say in a film. The directors. And they decided to do it their own way. I'm not responsible for it. GIVE US AN ELEGANT LIFE (PART TWO) Give me...! Give me...! ...a drink! DING DING DING BANG! BANG! BANG! Gorblimey! Can't decide what to choose from all this... HOUSE OF MIRRORS BANQUET HALL RELICT MAMMAL THE SO-CALLED LOCH NESS MONSTER BIRTHPLACE: SCOTLAND A rollie, huh?

Christ and Buddha are no longer trendy, Only Diogenes! Only Diogenes - Is just right for us. He proclaimed: Let's go back to nature! And to hell with all the bustle around. I'll live in a barrel, but I'll be free, And let my hair grow long! I'll live in a barrel, but I'll be free, And let my hair grow long! And we also have to live this way. Brothers, our time has come! And other classes, bosses and masses, May grow bald without us! And other classes, bosses and masses, May grow bald without us! Hasten to buy the elixir "Diogenes" - And your hair will grow to your knees! DIOGENES I'll sing, enraptured, and begin to cry. When you're with me, I become drunk without wine. It's impossible to escape from fate with laughter, As soon as I touch these strings, you'll be mine. We live once and die once, Kiss me and don't be sad, why should we get married? All the horses left, they raced away, I'm at the saloon and the sadness eats my soul. Hey, beautiful, wait a little bit, Let me get a drink and I'll be yours. I'll sing, enraptured, and begin to cry. When you're with me, I become drunk without wine. I'll sing, enraptured, and you'll be mine! Let's all have another round! Let's all have another round! Oh, you horses, falcon-horses!, How far have you ridden away from me? Oh, you horses, are you far or near? Let's all have another round! Let's all have another round! We live once and die once... Come on, sing it! Kiss me and don't be sad, why should we get married? You have talent, citizen Skripkin! However, in the conditions of the socialist system, you have no place to let loose. You must break through into Europe. Klak! Flash! PRESS CONFERENCE Gentlemen of the press, Let me introduce you to Mr. Skripkin. He fled from the socialist paradise. And as a statement of protest against the oppression of the free individual... changed the vulgar name "Ivan" into the more melodious "Pierre". I'm pleased to announce to you that Mr. Skripkin has signed a contract with our famous firm, and now he will sing to the glory of "Diogenes" and the entire free world! Comrades! Citizens! Brothers! I'm one of you! We all are parts of one folk...! Gentlemen! Misters! Monsieurs! I'm just an artist! BEDBUG LITTLE BEDBUG DARLING LITTLE BEDBUG In my play, a person who forcefully breaks away from his class for the sake of personal comfort is the image of political pacification. Political philistinism follows from domestic philistinism. --Mayakovsky Main roles by: Leonid Bronevoy, Galina Volchek, Iya Savvina, Yuri Chernov Actors and voice-actors Director's assistants, Camera assistants, Editor, Makeup artist Script editor, musical editor, conductor Production director The End Translated by daftdigger & Niffiwan, based on Max Hayward's work, Specially for KG Helped by: AlchemistOfSorrows, applesouce, corvusalbus, Veikko
