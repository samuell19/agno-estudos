Naufragio (1978) SHIPWRECK He'll arrive tomorrow. I am sure tomorrow he'll come. Amparito. It's very late, hurry up. The water is hot. If you keep washing those clothes, you'll ruin them. It's just that a lot of dust gets in the closet. I told you it's better to keep everything in a box. Today I was certain I would flnd Miguel Angel in his room. I dreamed I was searching for the building... but since so many look alike, I couldn't flnd it. Can you believe it? We bumped in the street, but didn't recognize each other... and didn't speak to each other. Do you have a needle and thread I can borrow? My hem came undone. Thread yes, but I can't find a needle. That's alright, we'll be late. They might have some at the office. Amparito. Lety, Lety. Thank you. Put it on your desk where you can see it. I am worried about my dream. Miguel Angel has never seen you, Lety. You could see and not recognize each other. But I'll know it's him when I see him. Don't worry. Don't expect him to be the same as in the photos. People change a lot in six years. He might have a beard. The dream must have been a warning, don't you think? I am sure he's on his way. I know it. I feel it. He's closer. He'll get here next week. Tomorrow, maybe. And when he meets you, he'll fall in love With you, Lety. And he'll never leave again. Never. Lety, the boss is calling us. Hey, don't forget to ask for permission to leave at noon. No, I don't agree. Mr. Romay from the Gustavo A. Madero office. Nice to meet you. - We had met before. - No problem. Everything can be fixed. Of course. Saturday? Very well. I'll see you there. My regards. Goodbye. Lety, let's see if you can help us. - With your permission. - Go ahead. This administration's procedure is urgent. Mr. Romay is a good friend of mine. Help him in whatever he needs. You too, Gustavo. And who should sign it? Mr. Paz isn't here. The director. I'll talk to him. It's better if Norma requests the signature. Just tell her I asked for it, OK? You didn't ask for his permission. When? He didn't even let me speak. I'll just stay and wait for him to be free. - What Will you say? - That I am going to the clinic. Mr. Romay takes care of urgent issues. Well, he gets them into motion, see? Then we just come and see how they are doing. The receipt from the fund administration. After everything has been approved by accounting... you have to submit it at payment control... With Tere and Amparito. I'll take you to them. Tere is great, she'll hit on you immediately. Amparito is harder, you see? But you'll Win her over if you ask her about Miguel Angel. Her son. He used to work at the cashier's desk but he left... five years ago and nobody heard from him again. What if I tell her we were together in school? Perfect. She gets very happy when someone asks about him. Just follow along and she'll treat you great. - Give me a cigarette? - Yes, man. Of course. What was the name? - Amparito. - The son's, idiot. Miguel Angel. What happened? Did you get permission to leave? Thank you. What's this? Do you belong to tomorrow's club, too? Damn it. It's like an epidemic. When you give me your picture... I'll put it in my desk also. If you'll be that way why don't we leave? There's no sense in wasting our time. What I want is for you to remove the photo. No. Why not? Because I don't like it when you order me around. And because I promised to put it there. What for? So I don't forget his face. Nobody forgets Miguel Angel's face. Fine. I'll remove it. Tomorrow. What I want is for you to not think of him. Tomorrow. I Wish he came back. He'll disappoint you. He's not so handsome? He's not ugly, but he was very selfish... and you don't like selfish people. Don't say things like that in front of Amparito. With Amparito you can only speak... about Miguel Angel's virtues. You speak about him With a lot of enthusiasm. He was my best friend. You should have gone With him. Yes. And to think I was the one who used to speak about... sending everything to hell and being adventurous. I used to complain every day about the routine... of our job as bureaucrats. Of being so confined in there. It was you who planned the trip to Veracruz, right? No, we didn't plan. By the time we sobered up we were at the beach. You should have seen his face when he saw the sea. - He hadn't seen it? - No. I've told you this a thousand times. And then? And then? And then we went to the dock. And he told us to pick him up after lunch. And when we returned we found him on a ship. It was an English ship. It was a Polish ship. I don't know how he did it... soon after he was already talking to the sailors... unloading the merchandise and speaking in Polish. Then in the afternoon it was getting dark... and we went to get him to come back together. We had no money left, we couldn't stay any longer. And he gave us his money. Imagine he was so stingy he wouldn't even buy you a beer. I said "This guy is insane." So I agreed With the others... to force him into the car and bring him back. He fought like a Wild animal. He tried to kick our balls and punch us. If he was any other, we could have forced him... but not Miguel Angel. Not at that moment. Bastard. We loved him so much. You should have seen the people at the office when they learned he wasn't coming back. I couldn't find my place. I often thought about leaving... to search for him, to catch up With him. I haven't forgotten Miguel Angel's image. Standing in front of the ship. All beaten up, With a bruised eye... blood running down his nose. With his fists closed. With the Will to not let us bring him back to this mediocrity. I often thought about leaving, about searching for him... I used to say tomorrow or as soon as I pay for the car. How I envy him, damn it. You know what the only thing that consoles me is? That he might have all that... the sea, the freedom. But I have you. - What time is it? - Damn, it's one. We won't have time to shower. - Are you going to college? - Yes. Hernández Pimentel Will be very mad. He didn't give me permission just because... he told me to return at night. Be careful because he likes you. Don't worry, I know how to handle him. It's not my job to wash dishes and take out the trash. Lety? Leticia, marry me. Tomorrow. I am serious. We would make a great couple. Hey, you want to know something? Although I am not certain yet... but the upheaval is fierce. Hernandez Pimentel... is struggling to be assistant director, then leader. Does your silence mean... you don't want to marry me? It means I don't know. It means I don't. I can't leave Amparito right now. She doesn't need what you pay for the room. I wasn't talking about that. I can find a different companion... and persons who could rent the room. Maybe I am the one who needs her. No. You're there for Miguel Angel. For Miguel Angel? For the memory of Miguel Angel, which is worse. I don't understand. Lety, I asked you to marry me and you rejected me. I think we should speak frankly. Fine, let's speak frankly then. Look, I think you are With me... just to hear me talk about Miguel Angel. We always end up talking about him. If you say so. You are in love With Miguel Angel. I understand. But it's a pity, Lety. Because you are in love With a dead man. Miguel Angel was killed three years ago in Vietnam. They saw him in Venice not long ago. Of course, the aunt of a cousin's friend. We'll be late. Lety, those are only lies. Can you imagine Miguel Angel dressed as a gondolier? Yes. Sure, and in his spare time he sells pigeon feed. There's a photo of Miguel Angel in Venice. That photo is so out of focus it could be me. Miguel Angel is alive. Yeah, sure. And he's coming tomorrow, right? Yes, it might be so. Shall we go? Leticia... it's better to not see each other anymore. Yes, we shouldn't see each other anymore. You leave me empty handed, Lety. No, Gustavo, you have María Luisa. And you'll also have... the leadership of the budget control department... of finance management from the general comptroller... of Mexico City's offlce. I am sure. Please, don't wander away, stay together. I'll see you in ten minutes at the international gate. Thank you. - Hello. - How are you? I called the agency they told me you are taking a group today. - I came to Wish you a good trip. - Thank you And I brought you a little present. That's very nice of you... but you shouldn't have bothered. - It's nothing. - It's very pretty. - I hope you'll use it. - Of course, in this field. And tell me, have you heard from your son? Nothing. Are you going to Venice on this trip? Yes. I promise to keep my eyes open. If he's at the San Marcos plaza... I am sure I'll see him. Thank you. This is the one you gave me last time I went. Yes, but this one is better... and I also wrote information on the back. I only need one. But I could give them to... the other guides and coworkers. Also at the hotels' reception desks. I Will be very grateful. - Miss... - Have a great trip. Ms. Dey, Ms. Dey... people change a lot in six years... please don't forget that. Maybe he has a beard, or long hair... you know how the boys are. Lety... would you like a drink? No, thank you. I have to leave in a half hour. Amparito worries if I am late. You should have your own apartment, Lety. Me? Wlth the money I earn here, impossible. This verification is going to have problems. It was processed Without the approval... of the goods control office. And if I help you get your own apartment? What would your Wife say? She doesn't have to find out. I better not, thank you. I am fine With Amparito. We keep each other company. Don't bite the pencil. I either bite the pencil, or bite you. So chew the whole pencil. You really don't want a drink, Lety? OK, fine. But just a little. - Mr. Hernández Pimentel... - Guillermo, call me Guillermo. Today they told me Miguel Angel... Amparito's son is dead. What do you know? - That it's true. - Who says so? A report from the legal department said so three years ago... from when they were chasing him for embezzlement. Embezzlement? What embezzlement? Miguel Angel ran away With money from office twenty two. Didn't you know? Amparito is returning that money With every paycheck. According to the report Miguel Angel... went into the U.S... With the birth certiflcate of a dead American... of approximately the same age. But he hadn't planned anything until he saw the ship. What ship? The Polish ship. He left from Veracruz on a Polish ship. Those are all lies. He went by truck to Chicago... and there he worked as a baker... under the name Charles Reina... until he was sent to Vietnam and killed. Miss Olga. - Have a good trip. - Thank you. Wow, if I ever see him I won't tell her, I'll kidnap him. Have another drink With me. No. - No, really, thank you. - Just one more. Don't leave, sweetie. - What? Don't you like me? - No, I don't. Then leave. But you'll regret it. I'll ruin your life. You'll regret it. You know I speak very little English, don't you? I wasn't going to start speaking. Of course, some words such as... good night, thank you, yes, of course, yes. Everything is truly wonderful. Nacho was right when he used to tell me... No, you have to go to New Orleans... you have to visit New Orleans, it is crazy. When we were there... a friend of Lupita took me... to visit the different zones. The precious things we saw... everything is so beautiful, you can't imagine. Especially the French Quarter, have you heard about it? I don't know why here in Mexico... they don't do something like that, honestly. There's no imagination. You are left in awe... because you see the gates and the Windows all in color. It's crazy. I really can't describe it. And then when we were on the tour... James and Guadalupe were telling me... and kept shoWing me everything, turn this way... look at that. You deflnitely don't know what to see first. I only kept telling myself... keep your eyes Wide open because nobody knows... when you'll have another chance. Imagine... for me to Win another prize like that. Those things only happen once in a lifetime. And later of course, you remember them... and reflect on them... Look at yourself, where were you? I went to the ISSSTE store. There's the receipt. We have to pay 173 pesos each. Do you mind if I pay you next week? I have no money. But they just paid us last Thursday. I had to pay some debts. But if you need the money, I'll give you the coupons. You also owe me the amount... for the mortgage I paid last week. I don't need the money... but I promised to help my mother... buy the juice extractor she wants. And why all those debts? You never have enough money. What's all that you owe? You never buy anything. You really need an umbrella. What are you doing? You'll catch pneumonia. What can I help you With? Don't go near the fire or you'll get sick. You should rent Miguel Angel's room. With meals you could charge 1,800 or 2,000 pesos. That's a good idea. But not Miguel Angel's room. Mine, I could sleep in the living room. Rent Miguel Angel's room. I don't think he is coming back. They say he was killed in Vietnam. That Vietnam story is very old... they invented it three years ago. This photo was taken eight months ago. I am not convinced that's Miguel Angel. It's very blurry. If Miguel Angel was dead I would know it. You can't lose an arm or a leg... Without noticing. It's that simple. When you become a mother you'll understand, Lety. He's so alive that all his friends remember him. Just today one of them came to see me... one of his high school classmates. - An opportunist. - What? They take advantage of you. The rumor has spread and instead of a small bonus... they give you stories and lies. Soon everyone will be Miguel Angel's former classmate. I don't understand you, Leticia. You're acting very strange. You don't usually doubt me. And that man didn't trick me, I recognized him right away... he was once here studying with Miguel Angel. But he's just a boy... he couldn't have been one of Miguel Angel's classmates. You're acting very strange. We better change the subject. Yes, let's change the subject. - Let's talk about the embezzlement. - What embezzlement? The one Miguel Angel committed. Miguel Angel never took a cent from anyone. When he returns he can hold his head up high. And the money you pay every two weeks... - what is it then? - It's for a loan. Yes. For a loan Miguel Angel requested... for this apartment's downpayment. Please forgive me. I said a lot of foolish things. And also some truths. We need money. If Miguel Angel doesn't arrive by this weekend... we'll rent the room. But he'll come. You'll see. I am certain he'll arrive. Tomorrow. What, aren't you going to pay me? - Don't you have any change? - Yes. I have some beautiful American dresses. No, no, not now. Lety. Lety, Amparo is looking for you. She went home. She couldn't explain... but left because of a phone call. They said someone arrived from somewhere. Amparito? Amparito? - Amparito? - Wait. - What happened? - Nothing. What do you mean nothing, what about those things? And the passport, who came? A young man who knew Miguel Angel. And what did he say? - He said Miguel Angel is dead... - No. He said... They gave him up for dead, which is very different. Three years ago. So he was very happy... when I told him Miguel Angel is alive. He even cried when I showed him the picture of Venice. You should have seen him. He left so convinced. What's wrong? Why aren't you in bed? It's very late. I stayed here thinking... and then I couldn't get up. What? My legs. They don't respond. I don't have any strength. - Let me help you. - In a moment. I lose my strength. I think getting wet the other night made me ill. I told you to stay away from the stove. Why didn't you call me? I didn't want to wake you up. Let me help you. But give it a try. You see? Very ill but still stronger than me. Lety... do you think he's dead? I don't know. But what do you think? That photograph proves he's alive. Maybe it's not him. It's so blurry. That's what I said... and you convinced us otherwise. Ay, Lety... I convinced you but I am not so sure. You'll think different tomorrow... it's because you have a fever. Maybe you caught a cold. Come on. Let's get you in bed. Hold tight. Stay here for the night. If Miguel Angel arrives tonight... he can stay in your room or mine. Stop crying. It's strange from you since you've always been so strong. Not anymore, Lety. Not anymore. Take a deep breath, please, stay still... don't move at all, stay still, don't breathe, don't move. How long have you worked there? 18 years, doctor. Current salary? 4,200. Where do you live? Sonora building, entrance six... department 101, Nonoalco Tlatelolco. Do you own or rent the apartment? We're paying it. Then you own it. How many meals do you have per day? 3. What do you have for breakfast? A milkshake, bread. - Not eggs? - Sometimes. In the milkshake or with rice. At what time do you have breakfast? Between 7:00 or 7:30. And lunch? Around 5:00. Around 5:00? At a restaurant or at home? At home. What do you eat? Soup, rice, stew. - Vegetables? Fruits? - Sometimes. Around 12:00 at the office. I have a sandwich or a taco and a soft drink. And dinner? I only have coffee with milk and bread. Menarche at what age? Excuse me, doctor? At what age did you have your first period? I don't remember, around fourteen. Fourteen? - Normal? - Normal. Menopause? At 44. - Without problems. - Without problems. Sex life, at what age? At twenty. First pregnancy? At twenty. Immediate. Childbirth was normal? Normal. - Abortions? - None. No abortions. - Did you have more children? - Only one. Is he alive? No. Lety, Hernández Pimentel requested your card. - Again? - A moment ago. - And Amparito? - Bad. Say hi for me. He requested it to add my tardiness. He is keeping an eye on you. Try to arrive early. Are you looking for Mrs. Amparito? She had an embolism and they took her. Yes. She's on the seventh floor in intensive therapy... from the elevators to the left. Visits are three times a day here: From 12:00 to 1:00, from 5:00 to 6:00 and at night from 10:00 to 11:00. And then you are all sad and lonely... just making the family pity you. And the friend? What friend? The Lupe? That one. She liked you more than Chela. Thank you for the miracle but that's not true. The problem is you don't have any self-esteem. You are still young. I wish. Besides, those women want to get married. Chela even proposed to me. That's really something. How was it? She proposed. She said: If you want me, we either get married or nothing. Amazing. Your permit is ready, request it on the first floor. Thank you. - How is she? - Very delicate. The next three days will be defining. Come stay the night. - Here? - No. In the waiting room. With your pass you can come in at any time. Miss, that offlce is closed. My issue is being handled by Amparito. She's still sick. Stand in this line. - I am not even going to tell you. - What? I am collecting for the wedding gift... of María Luisa and Gustavo. Please, I'll be glad to help. What are you planning to buy? We don't know. What do you think? He'll marry María Luisa, but wants you. Did they tell you about the bachelor party? No, don't go. He gave us an awful look. Don't mind him. Tell me what you know. Gustavo will keep the leadership? That's what they say. Think about it, he's a great catch. What I am interested in... is for Hernández Pimentel to go somewhere else. I can't stand him anymore, he wants to harm me. And Amparito? Any hope she'll leave the hospital soon? - No hope. - That's too bad. Tell her I said hi. See you. Hernández Pimentel has your card. It's very late, Lety. Leticia, they were looking for you. Good night. Wlll you sign this report? I'll take it to another floor. Review it later. Sign the card because I am late. They were asking for you, they'll come back later. Leticia? They said you could tell me about my mother. You are Miguel Angel. - Yes, Raquel, it's me. - Oh God... it's been so long since I last saw you... dear Lord, so many years. And your mother so ill. Come, tell her. Is it Miguel Angel? Lety lives with your mother. She has been a guardian angel for her. Gustavo will be happy when he knows you're here. Be grateful you found her alive. She was so worried... we had nowhere to find you. You should move her to another hospital. They haven't been able to cure her there. Look for Gustavo, he was on the third floor. Her heart recovers and then her lungs fail. They were going to operate on her kidney, but... She was like crucified. I thought you were like Santa Claus, you didn't exist. I am glad you returned. Come back soon, Miguel Angel. Don't forget your friends. How long has she been ill? About two weeks. And what's wrong with her? At first we thought it was a cold. Her whole body ached and couldn't move her legs. The first doctor that saw her said... it was a tremendous rheumatoid attack. But that was only at first. They hospitalized her for heart failure... and she had an embolism a week ago. - Do you live with her? - Yes. - Why? - She rents me a room. So you have keys to the apartment. - Yes. - Good. Let me borrow them. I want to rest a little. We didn't sleep all night. We drove from Veracruz. Do you know which building it is? Your mom is always afraid... that you won't find it. They all look alike. - Do you have another copy? - Yes, in the office. Or knock on the door, I'll be sleeping there. Won't you go to the hospital? Yes, sure. We just have to take care of the captain's issues. I came with some partners. They couldn't find a place to park... and I told them to drive around the plaza. - Is your name Leticia? - Yes. - Leticia what? - Ramírez. Had we met before? No. - How long have you worked here? - More than three years. Is my mother at the November 20 hospital? Yes. - What floor? - Seventh... intensive therapy. You know something? You were going to say something. In the afternoon. In the apartment. - Good afternoon. - Hello. Good afternoon. - Miguel Angel arrived today. - Really? Where is he? I don't know. Didn't he come to see Amparito? Today? Maybe in the morning. Not in the afternoon. He said he would come in the afternoon. Nobody came. He has a beard. Maybe he went to another hospital? No. I told him November 20. I told the night shift... to let Miguel Angel in if he comes. Thank you. - Did the blond leave the hospital? - No, she died. How? She looked fine in the morning, better than ever. It was death's improvement. Are you going to spend the night? Yes, but first I'll go to the apartment. I am worried about Miguel Angel. I am going that way. If you want I can give you a ride. - But can you wait a little? - Yes, of course. Amparito. Amparito. Miguel Angel arrived today. Miguel Angel is alive. I'll be right down! Mother! Mother? No, Miguel Angel, it's me, Leticia. Did I wake you? Good. What time is it? Almost 10:00. 10:00? I set the alarm clock for 8:00. Sometimes it fails. Maybe it went off and I didn't hear it. I was so tired. You didn't go to the hospital. I did, but they didn't let me in. It wasn't visiting hours. - How is she? - The same. Can we go now? No. But early in the morning we can. - Will they let us in? - Yes. I go there everyday. The chief nurse knows me. Want to get something to eat? I am hungry. As you wish. But if you want to have dinner... there's pork in green sauce here. - Really? - Yes. I cooked it at noon. It's my favorite dish, did you know? Yes. And baked spaghetti too. - You made spaghetti? - No. I don't know how. I always ruin it. Now I have a craving for spaghetti. I don't have any cheese or... No. Let's go buy it. And a bottle. Do you drink? Sometimes. On special occasions. This is a very special occasion, isn't it? But since they didn't speak a word of Spanish... nobody understood them. I am speaking too much and you don't say anything. It doesn't matter. I like listening to you. No way. It's your turn to speak. Did my mother tell you about the day I went mute? No. It was so funny. I didn't speak for a whole day. - Did you lose your voice? - No. Mute. - Really? - Ask my mom. And why was that? I'll tell you later. It's your turn to talk. Why do you live with my mother? She rents me a room. How did you meet her? Through Gustavo. You know Gustavo? How is he? Very well. He's getting married. He's getting married, taking advantage of my absence. I always stole his girlfriends. I really want to see him. You can see him tomorrow. And then? You were telling me how you met my mother. She once invited me to celebrate your birthday. To celebrate my birthday without me? We celebrate it each year. - I make the cake. - Who blows the candles? - The wind. - The wind. Yes, the wind. We put the cake out the window. One day I dropped it... and it fell on a lady that was walking by. No, I am just kidding. And your family? My mother and three stepbrothers... they live with my stepfather by the Villa. Two blocks away from Gustavo's house. He got me the job at the department. I suggested living with your mother, and she accepted. I told my mother and she agreed. I don't get along with my stepfather. Like Cinderella. And Prince Charming? Why haven't you married? I was going to get married to Gustavo. And then? - And you? - What about me? Why haven't you married? I am married. To the sea. It was love at first sight. Good night, Aurelita. - How is Amparito? - Bad. This is Miguel Angel. God bless you! God bless you! He flnally came. I am glad God allowed you to see her alive. You'll see how your mother will recover... now that you are here. You'll both take good care of her, right? - Good night. - Good night. My husband. It's Miguel Angel! Nice to meet you. He flnally arrived, Lety. He flnally arrived. This girl... go upstairs, I'll catch up with you. - Excuse me. - Yes, go ahead. I was telling you this girl... has been like a daughter to your mom... like a guardian angel. What was that? Be careful! I told you! These modern dances... I don't see the fun in bumping your hips. You either change the music, or the party is over! - With your permission. - Goodbye. We'll talk later, right? The things you must have seen around the world. But you'll have time to tell us... because you'll stay here, right? - Can I help? - Set the table, Will you? Alright. When your mother told me you went to sea... I envied you. Sometimes I wished to be a man like you. Men can always do those things. Haven't you heard of women's liberation? Yes but, it's not that. Besides, what do you think the sea is now? I remember went they took me to Baja California when I was a child. I saw it for the first time and it scared me. It was like a huge animal... that breathed everything in like a monster. But it felt like a free animal, and always alive. Don't you know the sea also dies? - It flies? - It dies, I said. The sea is dying. It's more polluted each day. Everyday it throws tons of dead flsh on the beach. Do you have garlic? Yes. It's in the container. There are even many parts of the ocean's floor... where there can't be any life form. Now they say only on the coast. Of course, that's where the trash is thrown. All of the city's waste... but it moves and the sea gets poisoned. You should have seen the bay of New York. The sea has a corpse coloring there. And then... maybe you ignore that they are finishing off... all the sperm whales, whales and seals... - And the mermaids. - And the walruses. Mermaids are not an animal. What are they then? How many have you seen? Many. Covered in Coppertone to tan their skin. And they speak French, Swedish and Zoodish. - Does that language really exist? - Doesn't it? What does that mean? That if you know how to... make love in reverse. Coming. Lety, it's me. Come in, Aurelita Just stopping by. Thank you. Has he told you about any tattoos? No. I remembered the Constantinople joke. Maybe he wins first place. Ask him. Let me know. - Go. - I am leaving. What happened? She brought some cake. Yes, but what did she say? Why were you laughing? She is very intrigued. She asked if there are any tattoos on your body. Why? Because she loves tattoos. Do you like them? I don't know. I have never seen one. What are you laughing about? It's a very rude joke. Which? The one about Constantinople souvenirs? Why did you turn the music off? No, no. I want them to play Uncertainty again. Uncertainty! Do you really have a tattoo? One. Do you want to see it? What did you say your name was? Josefina. No! Rita. No! The party is over. - I dreamed... - We were on a deserted beach. How did you know? Did I talk in my sleep? Did you have the same dream? No. I watched you while you were sleeping. And your forehead was like a movie theater. Really, what did I dream? We were on a lonely beach during sunset... almost before dusk. And we went naked in the water. The water was lukewarm and salty. We swallowed a lot... because the waves always surprised us while laughing. And then, at night, we laid down on the sand. You on top of me. We looked at the stars. You said you had seen a shooting star. You are a fortune-teller. What did you say your name was? I didn't say it. I always keep the secret. What? It's them. Mickey! Mike! Calm down, calm down. Can I come in? Can I have a drink? - Cheers. - Cheers! Garibalda Plaza - Muchachas. - Mariachis. No, no. Mariachis is mariachis... and muchachas is girls. Fiber, Miguel Angel. You won't win. And who are you? I am Negro Socia, I am an intellectual and sic. I went to New Yolk... meet Broway Paris. I who once danced the can-can. I am a world artist, world. Monsieur is my name Martínez Vidal and Ruiz. Yes, yes, oui, oui. My name is Julian. But monsieur Julian Martínez Vidal and Ruiz. Why do you push me? I am a world artist. They can drive there. Mickey, Mickey. Damn. Max! Max! Miguel Angel! I am bailing out. Max! Miguel Angel! I have to leave! The ship sails today! Miguel Angel! Miguel Angel! I'll come back soon! Tell her! Martínez Vidal and Ruiz. Did he leave without paying? He left before paying. That's why I always charge in advance. Do you know where they are from? I couldn't understand a word... but it was a lot of fun and they paid well. In dollars, which cost more than twenty pesos now. Do you live here? Won't you invite me for coffee? It's freezing cold. Oh God, please no, no. - What happened? What's wrong? - They stole from me. It wasn't me, you can search me. The only thing I have... are the dollars they paid me and some change. Who did it? Was it a lot? My paycheck and some savings I had... for buying my mother a juice extractor. Those bastards. And I have to go to the ISSSTE hospital. Can you lend me some money for the bus? Are four pesos enough? You are new at this, aren't you? Don't worry, it's the novalty. You'll recover. Oh well. A place in life. But for having things... for achieving them, we have to fight. We won't have them just because. But according to her, I am her worst enemy. Because I don't give her any freedom. Because I don't understand her. Because I don't comprehend her. Because I have tied her with my old-fashioned ways. If you could only see how much I pamper Doris. She's very well dressed, very presentable... her good food, her own bedroom, what can I tell you? Exactly as the ones on television. If she wants to dye her hair. If she wants this. If she wants that, I give her everything... according to my means, of course. Imagine that Joaquin, that boy... who is her boyfriend now, agrees with me. And then her father. I tell her Doris... you only see your father... when you need money. On father's day I told her... Come with me. You too. Your patient became very ill. Call Dr. González. Amparito. You have to get well. I need you. Amparito. Can you hear me? Miguel Angel is alive. He was here. He came to see you. He's alive, Amparito. Miguel Angel was here yesterday. Miguel Angel is alive. He was here but you were asleep. You have to recover, Amparito, because he'll return. He's alive, Amparito, he's alive. He'll come see you. Tomorrow? Yes. Tomorrow. How is he? Gorgeous. He's the most handsome man I know. His hair and beard are grey. But he is young. He's not old; he's very young and handsome. And he's coming to see you, Amparito. And you want to know something? He has a tattoo on his chest, close to his heart. It's a ship. And you know the name of the ship? It's called Amparo, like you. You have to see him. You have to get well, Amparito, so you can see him. And you know something else? We won't wait until tomorrow, or for him to come. We will go look for him. Today.
