- It's for me. - It's always for you. - I'm expecting a call. - You're not alone here. You know I forbid you to answer when it's for me. It's a catastrophe every time with you. You should give an example of when it's catastrophic, you lie all the time. Come on, help me out. Answer, he's going to hang up. Hello? It's for you. It's Henri. - Oh, I'm not there! - She's not there. Can I take a message? Yes. You know, I got another letter from this poor guy: a torrent of tears. - You remember that he was arranged to be married. - Yes. - And that he abandoned it again. - No. - Yes. I'll read it to you. Tell him I'm busy. - Excuse me, she's busy. "With an Englishwoman. But no doubt, she doesn't speak English. - "What should I do?" - Oh, men... And by the way, there's another from that one. Why is it not there? Tell me. For the record, I've always found him horrible. A real toad. I can easily picture him sitting four-legged on a waterlily. Croak, croak. I'm reminded more of grandma's Pekinese. - Tell him to be patient. - Just a sec, just a sec. Poor grandma, it's screwed up that she loved him. One gets attached, one gets attached... Do you remember how he died? The neighbors couldn't care because he always peed on our doormat. Then they kidnapped him, grandma didn't pay the ransom, and they killed him. They gave him to a butcher and delivered him back to grandma as minced meat. Poor grandma, if she hadn't broken her two teeth... on the tooth she gave Jimmy, she never would have recognized him. Listen, you're forgetting that it's me who put him down when he grew too old. Hello, I'm here, I'm listening. When will she be back? Wait, I'll ask her. When will you be back? - I don't understand. - "Hold on, here she is." Who? Excuse me, Juliette's here, who... who took her bath, who yelled for an hour, "Who is it?", and who heard her sister, her poor idiot of a sister say "Juliette isn't here." Why did she say that? Well, open your eyes: she's in love with you, my little Henri. But of course, she's a proud soul. She always hid it from you. Oh! I can't find the words, there are no words! It's false! It's Juliette who loved you. She adores you, she dreams of you at night. She screams: "Ah, my Henri! My Riquet, my Riri." She loves you, she adores you. She squirms in bed for the night you'll come back to her, then yells, "My Henri, my Riquet, my Riri." No, last night that wasn't it, it was: "Henri's eyes, Henri's eyes!" I hate you! This is horrible. You and your dirty skin! I know at least four girls who've spent years trying to fix things. Years! Don't be harsh, make a little effort and I'm sure you'll love her too. Oh thank you, thank you. Oh, you're good. Then tonight at 9:00? Oh, she'll be happy. Good, it's should suffice that I pity you. My poor girl. I hung up a long while ago. Really, you grieve me. You understand, it's as much as possible. You hung up? Say, did you when you spoke... or before? Before, but I'm too good. But I think before I speak. "Hello, she's not there. When do you get back?" How numb. I'm exasperated, exasperated. I spend my time fixing your mistakes. Oh and you're always barefoot. You'll catch cold. Good, now I'll call Henri to apologize. But Henri doesn't matter. But he does, my little one, he does. One must never cause hurt. And one must never annoy anyone, even Henri. You never know, he may be of use. Oh what do I say to him? After he hung up in my face... Hello, Henri? Juliette. It wasn't very nice of you to do that. I'm not usually hung up on like that. Who took you? I'm not convinced but I want to believe you. Sure, someone cut us off. Alright, alright, goodbye Henri. Yes, until soon, goodbye. Even you understand that he can't put up with your constant mistakes much longer. A tongue that checks itself, masters itself. If you want to consider yourself an evolved person. Evidently you don't get headaches often. What comes in, goes out... the toilet. But are you seriously not humiliated to screw up all the time like that? To have as little control as you do? Not at all, it's the type of woman I am. Martin melts every time I screw up, it's that simple. Yes but Martin is something else: he loves you. Listen, sometimes it costs me to lie. But at least when I speak, I say exactly what I choose to say. And not something that went through my head like that, by chance. No, I said the whole time, "I must find something," something for me. Because you understand, a lie is really told to oneself. And what merit is there in telling the truth? That's laziness. That all comes alone evidently. Then it's not funny, it's insipid. No, it gives me pleasure, try doing the exercises sometime. I know: turn my tongue seven times in my mouth before speaking. But no, with that system you have an idea, you examine it... you develop it, but it comes out nonetheless... What's necessary something else left out, which you don't have yet. Lying. That's a strong asset, you need it. And then you'll see, it's amusing. It's like a novel. Only... instead of writing a novel, you live it. 9:00 already! My God! Damn it! Fucking shit! Val sans bleu. God-damn-fuck. Bourgeois... You're a whore and... ah no, that's not a curse word. Dead toad of love. Talk about a dead toad of love, then, when you have Henri on the phone. Juliette, can you make me some coffee? With a lot of milk. Is it nice outside? Oh, it's nice outside! I'm hungry! And the other? Juliette, is the coffee ready? My water! And my coffee! 74. Yesterday I was stuck at 43. But I'd had a little breakfast. You didn't leave again, did you? It's you who's leaving. You're an egotistical monster, I'm in a hurry. - Oh look, you've dropped Donald. - This isn't Donald. This isn't Donald? Ah, no, it's not Donald. This is Oscar. - No, poor Juliette. - Come, my little one. - I'm taking a bath, get out of here. - You're already late, take it tonight. Good, count to 300 and we'll talk about it some more. Working with this sun... Oh and not a single pair of stockings is left for me, I've had enough of this. I had to put back yesterday's. They were full of mud from a puddle. You take everything from me, always. You take my stockings, my bath. Yesterday you took my anti-wrinkle cream, it takes an hour to prepare! You didn't leave me a bit. - Are you fasting with the paper or are you coming back here? - 77. All that for three stupid sardines this summer. Ah, you and your submarine fishing. What is this blouse, another new one? You refuse yourself nothing. How much did you pay for it? It's not bad, actually, this blouse. Is your wig ready? I'm late. I'll put makeup on later, when I go to Jojo's. Good, sunglasses. My coffee... it feels all empty. I'm going! - You're there again? - Hardly at all. I'm going. Until tonight. Until tonight. Until tonight! My blouse! Ah no! Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle. Leave me alone, won't you look at yourself? I'm not as bad as that, look at me. It's you! I was afraid you'd be one of those types like the cars on the side. - They look at me the whole time! - I'm sorry to interrupt you. But you're welcome! Here, I'm with you. Not too long, eh, I'm already late. Your papers please. It's always the same story. Going through this again will take hours. All that for a little Rimmel. Frankly, I'm better like that, no? Ah, it's true that you didn't see me last time. I'm ugly after waking up. I have eyes it's best that no one sees. Like that. - You can arrange yourself over there. - I know, I know, all the same... Hello. Is Sophie there? - Sophie isn't here. - Ah really? Not because I came by. I delivered a car to the side. Fine, I'll iron tonight. Ah, but tonight I don't think that Sophie will be here. - Is she going out? - Well, she'll want to. Martin, have a cup of tea. I got it from China. You see, this is the day and the night. Did she have an accident? You could call it that. Has she done some foolishness? Oh that, yes. Is she expecting a baby? All the same... but that doesn't tire you, you men, always thinking about the same thing? Ah no. That doesn't happen, thank you. Have a seat. Sophie had some trouble with the police. - A sugarcube? Two? - The police? No, no sugar, thank you. Ah, but I see that I have to become a connoisseur. Feel this: a marvel. Notice they were nice: they warned me. - Who? - The job. She's there this moment. - Sophie? - Yes, curled. What did she do this time? Ah, what a number. She's cute. Juliette, you're the one who has an influence on her, do something. She needs to get married. I can't do any more. There, it starts again: the obsession. You can be distracted for two minutes but no more. Why did you send for your Chinese tea? - There's some Chinese tea in Paris. - Oh no, Martin, no. You're not a poet. This one comes from China. The other too. Ah, yes, you're charming. Martin, what were we talking about? China, tea and Sophie. Ah, Sophie. Sophie... But between us, think before slapping an agent. - What love. - Again, this morning I told her to cut her nails. They're as long as that. Dining on milk like her isn't prudent. Notice that she's not mean and once calm, she regrets. In the ambulance, she demanded an apology for him from the agent. She held his head herself while he was bandaged. What did he do for her? Advances? He is obsessed! Martin... do they often do this to you in front of agents? Good, I'll tell you. I stand aside on the sidewalk, he reestablishes his circulation in two hits of a spoon to a jar. Quickly, to the pin. He comes along, I get really scared... I'm so ugly on my permit photo that it's unbelievable. I don't like to show it, it's human. - He stops in front of the car. - Sophie, telephone. Oh, I'm coming. She's coming. The display will never be finished, that makes 3 disruptions for the artist. Briefly, he seemed terrifying. I trembled. And you know what he says to me? The best: he asks me for a date. What a lightning bolt. The poor girl. - She's good, no? - Did you accept? I'm seeing him tonight. An agent, you'd think. I can't refuse. And he's cute, too. You again! Aren't you working? No, I'm at the house. Martin is there. He's very charming. Say thank you, Martin. I told him everything, is that what you want? On the contrary. What did you say? - About the agent. - That he liked me? - Not at all. - What then? - Everything. - Everything? - Everything. That you slapped him, scratched him, the ambulance, provisional liberty, everything! I knew you'd want something from me. Martin, leave me alone. Is he leaving you alone? What is he doing? Well, nothing. - Martin... - She'll pay me back for this. - I had some doubts. - About what? - You love him. - Who? Me? - Yes yes. - But no. - But yes. - It's false. - But no. - Good, that's enough. I have to work, what do you want? To say that Martin should come and see you so you can tell him everything. He's worried, the poor dear. Isn't that right, Martin. Oh, life is complicated. - Why did you tell him all that? - Only for your own good. Do you remember what I told you after the call with Henri? And well, here, I've prepared everything. This is your first lesson, well, do you want it? To become like you? No, I don't want to lie to Martin. Well, I guess, yeah, sure. Casanova! Perfect, I'll kiss you. Martin, a little restraint. She'll pay for this. She'll always have me... What are you doing here? Where'd you come from? Come inside. No, I have work, I can't. - Where'd you come from? - The garage. - Have you seen Juliette? - Yeah. - Where? - Your place. - When? - This morning. I told Juliette I'd see you at noon but I could come earlier. Ah, she had not foreseen it. Ah, family... And men, and I fall for it. Good, what do you want? Listen, this isn't the time or the place. I have my display to do. - Then? - Tell me what happened this morning with the agent. Juliette made my mouth water. - What did she tell you? - Guess. That I hurt him or I'm going out with him tonight? - Are you going out with him tonight? - Answer first. That you hurt him. Oh wow, it's true, your nails are long. It's pretty. But I didn't believe it, Juliette. And well, exactly, you were hurt. Because it's true. - You're going out with him tonight? - I'm going out with him tonight. Then you're going out with me tonight. - I can't go out with you tonight. - Why can't you go out with me? - Because I'm going out with him tonight. - With his bandages? But no. I told Juliette that I seduced an agent. It was moral. She embroidered it. Then why did you tell me it was true? To lie. An idea of Juliette's. One more. I'm in training. She's not very talented with the apprentice liar. But she's persistent. She's strange right now. Then, are you going out with him tonight? Martin! Someone talked about Juliette. I'm telling you that I'm worried. "I'M ANNOYED." - Betty! - I'm on the phone. - Is he still there? - Yes yes. - What does he seem like? - Boa... But what does he want? He asks Juliette for love letters. You scared me. And he insists. He won't be discouraged. A man who sends love letters must be dumb. He's dumb? Shall I send him in? - Send him in... - You can come in. I, I can? - Come in, come in. - Oh, you're very pretty. I, I'll sit. - Then what's going on? - Oh, but Zuliette. You're too young, and too pretty, oh I don't dare more. Well then, don't look at me anymore. Oh, oh but I want to look at you. - You're so pretty. - Alright... First, what name do you go by? Ah, but you know me. I've often written you love letters. S?bastien, you know me well. - S?bastien? - S?bastien. - The seducer? - Yes. Ah, it's you. The man who can't meet a woman without falling in love with her. That's me. I'm not trying to bother you, just trying to clarify everything. Ah, I know. But I have charm, it seems. Hold on, I'll tell you: I don't know if you noticed but I have... a little problem there. But even that, that pleases people, it touches them. - No no no, this is impossible. - But it's very pleasant to please. I love to please. No, I can do more. I can do more, I can do more. But it's always ended in made-up stories. - You'll remember. - But, I pleased less. Now I please more and more. Oh no, this is hell. I don't eat anymore, I don't sleep anymore, I'm rejected everywhere... Today, I'm unemployed. But you're dramatizing, S?bastien. Juliette. I beg you to do something. I want nothing more than to please, I want nothing more than to be loved. Very well, my dear S?bastien, we're in agreement. I'll take care of you. No, no, and no. I don't want any more games. I don't want to see you. Before it was from time to time, good, it was bearable. Now it's every day, we see each other every day. You're cute when you're angry. But look: your fist is covered in mashed potatoes. But what must I do for you to leave me alone? If one day you want me to leave you alone... you won't need do anything, I'll leave you alone completely. So then, now. I want you to leave now. No. Now that's not what you want, that's that. Anyway, you don't do badly for a naif. - But I don't get by, I love you. - Yes, I know: "no one could, can, or will ever be able to love me like you." That's your whole spiel. It's a barrier like any other, no more, no less. What are you eating? And you? Do you know S?bastien? - I'll show you. - Show me. - Where is he? - S?bastien? - I'm here! - Ah, he's here. - Say hello to S?bastien. - Hello S?bastien. - Hello S?bastien. - Hello, everyone. This is Sophie. And him, who's this? Is this your boyfriend? - Oh he has a good head. - Not at all. - Well don't I have a good head? - Doesn't he have a good head? - Sure, but he's not my boyfriend. - Mimi, what am I eating? - He certainly doesn't have such a good head. - Corn, of course. - Oh yes, corn. - Corn with a lot of butter, it's for Juliette. Let's order two. S?bastien, would you like one? Oh, look at the little couple, they're so cute. - Are they getting married? - What are you doing with him? Where's he from? I found him at school, I was asked to take care of him for the paper. He's taking reeducation treatment for the retarded. There, you see. - Oh, Sophie. - Oh no, don't talk to him, he won't understand at all. And he drools from time to time, just try to ignore it. - I'm still hungry. - But are you really still hungry? You ate almost nothing. Good, I'll finish your potatoes. But Juliette, what's going on with you? - Why did you say all that? - Did you want to please? No. Then let me do it. Oh, oh I retract what I said. - You're an angel. - But by the way, Juliette, what are you doing here? This morning you told me: "tonight." You shouldn't be here. This is Sophie, isn't that right? Always with the quick reaction. And well you see that I'm not not there, I'm there. Look at the guy at the end of the counter. He's good, eh. His name is Matthieu Br?vant. He's my employer. I almost never see him, he's the big boss. I'd like to change places with his cup of coffee for two seconds. - But you're crazy. - This is, this is questionable. In any case if it's necessary to be like that to please you... Because you're petty. Even if you wanted, you couldn't. Mademoiselle Anceny. I don't know if Mlle. Germain warned you, but I'm accompanying you today. Bravo for your photo idea. - But for the first time I prefer to be there. - Oh, but of course. Do you know my sister? Juliette. Monsieur Br?vant. - Delighted. - Mademoiselle. - My friends. - Monsieur. - Monsieur. - Sophie, here we are! - Good day, Gaston. - Hello, Soph'. So, my love doll, is everything going to your liking? This is Thomas and Vincent, they're coming with us. To carry the equipment. It's heavy. - But that doesn't scare us. - You need to have muscle. Test Gaston. Gaston, do a test, Gaston. They're completely stupid but they're very serviceable. Yes, I see I see, perfect. I remember you from the store, Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle, Messieurs. Who's this annoying, outrageous guy? Oh, you bullies. What things these people say. - You did well in front of my employer. - Oh, good evening, pretty Madame. - I present you S?bastien. - Hello S?bastien. - Hello. - Good day Gaston. Gaston? But Gaston is you. He calls everyone Gaston. - While there are so many other pretty names. - Oh, there's a flaw there. Oh, you noticed, eh. I'm clumsy but I like it fine. Not you? S?bastien my friend, you please me. - Oh you have something sacred in your hands. Teach us! - Are we leaving? That's just as well, I'm already out of my seat. I'm coming with you. Mimi will pay tomorrow. There, it's because of my employer I bet. - But no, I'm taking S?bastien with me. - Oh help! Where's the equipment? - But in the store, my dear. - But in the store. Let's see, Gaston! - Sophie, are you coming? - I'm coming. Well, Martin, good day, eh. - Goodbye, see you soon. - You don't say. For someone passionately in love you seem very happy to leave me. Ah, I thought I knew you well. But I knew you were going to say that. You'd want me to leave you sobbing? Well, no, my love. I have work, I'm already late, and we have life in front of us. Good day. Oh, would you believe my man! - Hello Madame Germain. - Hello Madame. - Is everyone here? Good, you can take everything you find. Collect. - Take the horn. - I'm taking the horn. - You, take the things over there. - Yes. - Here it is. What are you doing there? - You, take the canned peaches. - Does that do it for you? Here it is. And this lady, is someone taking her out? She's nice. - How's it going? - I think we're not missing anything. No? Alright. Let's go. What's left, Madame Germain? Ah, I'll take the fish. - Well then? - Good, let's get together, there's plenty. You, take the suitcases over there. You take the artillery. - There's something over there. - And me? - You take what's left. - Good. And that's it. So what are you waiting for to put everything in the car? Are you just going to stand out here by yourself? Well... whatever, damn. But no, put it all in your car. We don't have any more space. And follow me. Juliette! Follow me. Cling to my lambs. - Hey S?bastien! - Hey Vincent! Oh it's tremendous, a woman who drives, someone who can do whatever she wants. Thomas, hold on. Say. In the shop they were left with nothing to say. This is my first hold-up. - It wasn't a hold-up. - I know that. I was joking. Where are we going? But what are we going here for? This isn't the way. I know. But I adore the St. Louis island. I always stop by. Let's go! He's handsome in his car. So serious, so haughty. A knight of the Middle Ages. Juliette! Are you bored? The tires? The direction? Not me. I'm dreaming. Stop! It's there. Is he dead? No, he's not dead. Take out the equipment! And you! Band of worms. Stand or I'll shoot! Ah. You should all get out. We'll eat during the recreation. I'll take the devices. We'll start with the landscape. - But that's a little embarrassing, give it back to me! - The poppet. - My ham butter. - To work. - He wants his ham butter and I want mine, too. - Thomas! The plaid! And me, I want ham butter too. I have more heartburn. And I'll see your sister. And I'll scare her. Leave me alone, S?bastien. S?bastien. Warn Sophie and the others not to come when I call for help. Don't use you head here. Just do what I tell you. Go on, go on. Plaid. Ah, here it is, my little castle. Sophie. Sophie, I'm worried. For Juliette? I can see that, although you don't know her. Help! Help. Oh my god. - Sophie! - Help! - Sophie! - Calm down S?bastien. - Help! - I'm going. Hold him down. Help! Help! Help! Where are you? Over here. Guide me. I'm here. It was like a nightmare. I thought no one would come and I'd have to spend the night here. It was your idea to take a walk in these bushes. It's careless. I was fascinated. It's beautiful. I don't understand why my sister didn't hear my calls. They're busy with their work. Without you... oh I'm bleeding. Why can't I hear anything anymore? Perhaps someone went there anyway. Sophie! We'll go in two minutes. Besides, I need help. - Oh! - No but who is it? Oh! Martin! Hey Martin! Sophie, it's Martin! It's really not important. - He's in Paris, Martin. - Hey princess. You look beautiful in your tower, princess. Oh, burned! Oh, I'm exasperated. - How did you find us? - Someone already came here, both of us. - And your work? - I'm going there. But I wanted to kiss you so I made up something to do. I can't stay a minute. I'll come up. You have a sacred toupee. You can neglect your work, sure. But mine? When you get married you won't work anymore. - You say that deliberately to make me angry. - Yes. Because when you're very mean, afterwards you're very nice. Then I have something to look forward to. Well this is very nice, but I didn't come here to chat. I'd like to take you far away. Do you even know where? - In your dreams. - And I'll keep you... until the end of the world. What a fascinating life. We'd get up only once a week to change the sheets. But in itself that's not a bad thing. We'd have a bed to rumble in. Say what you want about rumbling. I have a client waiting for me. - I love you. - Martin. You're completely crazy but sometimes you're cute. Ah, finally, here she is! Here's Juliette! How the time flies. When I think I retransfer you every day and that I'd known that today. But now, we have more time. Hey Juliette! - Hey. Did you take the bottles, Vincent? - Yes, boss. Hold on, Martin came by. He adores me, it's crazy. Oh it's difficult to resist someone who loves you so much. I feel so many emotions. Ah I'm so hungry! - Hold on. - You might as well take something, Monsieur Br?vant. Yes. Your sister. You have to write to mom, it's been two weeks since I've written. - Who wants wine? - Me, it's been a long time. - You don't drink beer? - But didn't she say she was coming to Paris? - Next month. - Because your parents live in the province? - To our health. - Amboise. - Someone born in Touraine. - That's a Tourangelles. I was three when someone came to Paris and said: "Paris, to both of us." Like Antignac. It's a matter of... I saw Tartuffe this morning. - Sophie... - Rac... heu, Moli?re I know. It's to go more quickly. Besides, you know, I was so quick I failed to flank Tartuffe to the ground. He's a tenant. He's a dirty smiler who cannot feel, eh Juliette. - Not often. - Hypocrite. And then... not polite at that. This is if he doesn't see us. He cannot feel, eh Juliette. He's a shady type. He always seems like he wants to start a fight. Hold on, start a fight: why did you say not to come if you called for help? Because I love being dragged by the ears. Why are you behaving like that? - Well it's S?bastien who told us, huh? - Ah yes. I believe you knew what was going on, S?bastien. Didn't I warn you? He's a little... simple. I literally told him this: to tell you I was going to take a walk... and that you'd only have to call me for help if something went wrong. - Here. - It's really that? What a wound. You could have drowned, or God knows what. Fortunately there wasn't time to warn me. - Ooh. - Oooooh. Are you annoyed, S?bastien? A little, yes. I need to sulk for five minutes. After that, we'll go. But you wanted to displease, S?bastien. And well, I swear to you that you're bothering Sophie. - It's already big, isn't it? - I don't want to bother Sophie. Which you complicated. I will arrange that, but give me a smile. Not as long as Sophie believes I'm crazy. Good, I'll explain everything to her. He's really very upset, you know. You really must console him. Then I'll tell you this between us: he's not at all crazy, he's obliged to pretend to be for his mission. - Is he a secret agent? - I can't say anything more. Only for everyone, he's crazy. But you wanted to know, so now you know. Is that true? Oh, that's very nice. S?bastien, don't be upset. Juliette told me everything, and I like you a lot. Let's go. - Then you're a detective? - Ah no, not at all. - Ah, I shouldn't ask questions. - No, please do. Ask away. - It must not be fun to act like an idiot. - Ah, no. But, there are pleasant compensations afterwards. Old yokels, listen to me. S?bastien has returned in grace, long live S?bastien! Bravo. He was always my buddy, S?bastien. Let's go, come on. Where are you going? But not like that. All together now! Hat! - You see: I'll follow you everywhere. - Ah, leave me alone. But do you see what's going on? I don't make a habit of being tossed in the water. - But this is so I can warm you back up. - Oh. Then, shall I see you tonight? - Ah, if you want. - Yes, yes, at what time? - As soon as possible. - At 10:00. - Yes. Where? - At the Lemon Slice. Do you know it? But yes, of course I do. - Until tonight. - Until tonight. Good evening Juliette. Oh, you're beautiful. Even more beautiful than last time. You know that I... I can't find the words. - I think I've kissed you in front of everyone. - But no. Then let's not stay here all night long. I want to be alone with you. Because you are kind. Hold on, here they are. I've been here at least half an hour, where were you? It's you who told us... You told us to arrive after Monsieur Br?bant to give him a little surprise. I was afraid to be alone with you. - I see. - I'm here! Hey! Come in, I'm here. He'll really be disappointed to see that I'm not alone. Well done. All the savages. Be seated, be seated. Let me introduce you. - This is, um... - Albert Buche. This is Albert. He's a piece of trash. Don't you know what he did to me this morning? A little yellow paper. A parking ticket. He's a cop. Ah, I'm grieved. I was obligated, it's my professional conscience. - But permit me to offer you this. - Oh what, love. Oh how elegant he is. Oh say, what intersection are you at? I could try to stop by there. - Ah, but you're not a pretty girl. - Oh, you noticed? Good day my little flowers, may I join you? Join us, join us. Ah, here are three unknown faces. - Who's the beautiful pear tonight? - It's not me. On the other hand, let me introduce myself: Matthieu Br?bant. Albert Buche. Oh, two of a kind. Well then, what an evening! Bravo. Hat. Then you were hoping for a little one-on-one, eh. Come on, you all knew that. Really, they're cute, these girls. Ravishing. What a bunch of washouts. No, but look at them. One, two, three... if I stay one minute longer looking at these faces, it'll end badly. I must do something. - Oh my god! - What is it? - What's going on? - Come on, Juliette, what's...? - This man here is too much? - But this man? Who's that? - A spy? - But tell us! I can't, I don't have the right. I'll talk to him. - Have you thought this over? - Don't go there, Gaston. Do you want me to go there? Believe me, I have better things to do this time of night. But please, don't follow me, I beg you. What do you want? But... me? Don't deny it. You called me, here I am and I'm asking you: - do you want me? - Was I the one who called you? Did I call you? But what's your name? What's your name? Seriously, tell me, what do people call you? Tell me to sit down. I beg you, tell me loudly. Sit down. Hey, sit down! I should explain myself. I'm at the end of my rope, this is a nightmare. I thought these stories were only in novels, but... I... I can't anymore. I'm here with a man. that gray-haired man over there. He wants me much too badly. But what happened between you? What can I do? Ooh la la. Family stories were told, of a sordid heritage. He followed me, so I wanted to scare him away. I said: "hold on, a friend's calling me. "To be precise, it's the police." And I came towards you. - Your face gave me confidence. - Ah, you too? That's what everyone tells me: "Robert..." Yes, my name is Robert. You love it or you don't love it, but you get used to it. But people call me Robert since... well, that's stupid: since forever. "Tobert you're not handsome." Yes, it's true, in the sense of classical beauty, isn't that right? But likeable. And I'm very compassionate. Thus, I'll do everything in my power to help you. But you already helped me by not turning me away. Thank you. Only... he must be scared, but without being sure. - Good. - Then tell me loudly: "Goodbye my dear Juliette..." - Hold on, your name is Juliette? - Yes. - But you won't leave right away. - But yes, I will. - "Goodbye my dear Juliette, all your stories don't interest me." - But yes. But no, be cold, make me angry for seeing you don't believe what I've told you. Angry? Ah no ah no no no. I... I beg you. Then I'll try to the best of my abilities. But before, tell me where I can see you again and when. One day, maybe. But now that would be too dangerous for you. You don't deserve it. You were so understanding. At last, I'll try to escape from him. Farewell. - Good now go on, send me away. - No, wait just one more minute. Right away. Sorry in advance. So I'll tell you: "Goodbye my dear Juliette, "all your stories don't interest me." That's all. Excuse me. Goodbye my dear Juliette, all your stories don't interest me. We're leaving. Good, let's take a ride to the bar, I'm going. - Mlle. Marsenile, until tomorrow. - Until tomorrow, M. Br?bant. Really, you're perfect: it's enough for someone to look at me for you to dive in front. But I saw you. You're wearing a dress that I don't know. It's pretty. This isn't a dress, it's a suit. It's good, eh? - Does it suit me? - Of course my darling. My little child. You lie because you know that compliments soften me. - I must go. - Stay a little longer with me. I can't, Juliette is waiting for me. Why do you put on lipstick to say goodbye? Goodbye, goodbye... I must hurry, Juliette is waiting. Why didn't you wait for us? And who's this? - But me, I know nothing. - So then what are you doing here? It's you who has the keys. You've had time to return them. I was with Martin. I fell in love with him today. If not for this I would have stayed a little longer. You've really made him stubborn as a mule. He has patience, I admire that. He loves me like that. I'll tell you once more: he loves me like that. He's a cautious type, like all men. Until one day, when he'll have some laughs. But no, but no. Well, so someone talked about you. You and your inventions. One day you'll end up in a lot of trouble. Who did you say this guy was? He's an old friend, I've known him for years. - He's Tartuffe. - But where is he going at this hour? He's out at these hours all the time. I'd very much like to know what he does with his life. Something not too clean, you can be sure. You'll need to ask the concierge. It's that, for her he keeps doing it. No, you'll find him all alone. Did you think he'd tell us good evening? Ah, how churlish. Say, imagine if someone put oil on his landing? He would be less dignified, I'm sure. Going down the stairs on his ass would do him some good! No, no one's gonna do that. But we'll take care of him, he deserves a good lesson. He's done well. I want to go for a ride, are you coming with me? You seem cheerful. Anyway, you had to have fun tonight. Are you annoyed again? No, I'm not annoyed. I'm even having fun now and then. Then it's always the same old thing, the routine, the bankruptcy. Besides, you see, I've scarcely lied these past few days. - I didn't even lie at all. - Ho hum. The end of a liar. I'm ashamed. I'm exhausted. - Haven't you slept? - No... these days it never happens... - You're exaggerating. And Br?bant? - Oh, I'm leaving that one to you. That's too easy. And he's a 12-year-old, like the others. So frisky, no, the most possible. It's absolutely necessary that I find something. And if you take care of Tartuffe? Why not? Tartuffe... I'll take care of Tartuffe. I'm listening to you. A steak with fries, please. That's not possible, Mademoiselle, this is a vegetarian restaurant. No, I didn't come to the newspaper today. And maybe not during the past few days. But by chance I came across something of... No no, not for my section. But this is rather promising. Ah, it's not too early. Sophie. Sophie. Oh, she comes back at impossible hours. "If you don't have to return to the cemetery, shut up!" Oh, damn. - Are you pleased? - Oh but this is very pretty! Is this you there? - Yes. - Bravo bravo bravo bravo... Oh, it's time for the turtledove, this is a great love! Yes, that was undisputed today. But again, it's very early. I was going to say that. - You're almost bored when there's no dispute. - Yes. By the way, Juliette, what are you doing there? And Tartuffe? I lost him again after the restaurant. But tonight, I'll catch his eyes. Come over here. Over here, over here, over here. Let's get out of here already. Now you'll have something to drink. - Oh no, not in this dirty neighborhood. - Good, I'll take you somewhere. - And my car? - You'll take it tomorrow, come on. By the way, thank you. You're welcome. - Where are we going? - It's a surprise. You know, I feel a lot better now. Maybe we could go back directly to the house. No, you'll have something to drink. You have nothing against the riverboats? Good, we're going? Two coffees, two cognacs. You're funny. Acknowledge that I'd had you. That could have ended very badly for you my little woman. Fortunately, I arrived on time. It was you who said it, besides. Hold on, I'm getting hungry. And a sausage, eh, but... - Not you? - No. Do I really scare you so much? - But you'll acknowledge that you looked for me. - Me? Little devil. You think I didn't see what was going on behind me yesterday and today? But I presume you saw yourself? Good, now do me the pleasure: tell me the conclusions on my person that you drew from it. Especially when I think about the letters in the wastepaper basket. You wouldn't entrust me with your little sister, eh? Sophie, I believe. Good, then listen, to reassure you, I'm a lawyer, I work with delinquent youths, I promise you I won't put arsenic in your coffee. But you're completely mistaken. Ah, didn't you follow me? Do we go to the same places? You're making fun of me. Yes, I followed you, but... it wasn't to spy on you. Am I auditioning for something? I don't want to tell you that here. Yes, then let's go to the bridge, to hell with the sausage. I'm listening to you. If I followed you, if I didn't want to lose sight of you for one minute, if I perhaps embarrassed you, it's because, for a long time, I've loved you. You don't believe me? Anyway, I'll swear that it's true. You know what they call my sister and me? Le Cid. And in my heart when I think about you, I say: "Rodrigue." You're sensational! - I wondered what you were going to find. - You don't believe me? Oh no, not at all. I must give you a reason my little Juliette, you're well known in our building. - Well known? - Yes, well known. All the tenants knew of your intentions. Inventions, rather. And I awaited my turn with impatience. It's too unfair to be taken like this into your neat trap. I lied, it's true. But now I'm not lying. Must I believe that you, Juliette, young, pretty, full of life, the second of two pretty sisters, is in love with an ugly old guy like me? But look at me, I'm not amusing at all. I'm even old-fashioned, I find. - No, you are wonderful. - Juliette... Good, it's time to go to sleep for small children... - who did stupid things. - I'll make you believe me. I'll prove that I love you. Rodrigue. Yes, your Rodrigue, he'll get out of your way. Because before you start swimming again you must wait to return ashore. Go on, tell me a story. I love you. Juliette, my little one, I have work. Oh, take me with you. But what the hell is this game? - But then will I see you again? - Of course, of course, goodbye. You're stubborn. Good, if you're coming, we might as well go there together. Do you know how long I've loved you? You say always. Since the day I saw you collect a small injured cat on the sidewalk. I have never collected an injured cat on the sidewalk, you got carried away with a false lead. And since it wasn't me, you don't love me anymore. One obliterates all. Now it's too late. Since you knew us so well, my sister and me, why did you never say hello to us when we met in the stairway? It hurt me so much. No, did I do that? I crossed you often without greeting you? Decidedly I'm more and more distracted. I'm very sorry. Even getting gasoline with you is wonderful. I was sure that you smoked. The Pl?iette, that suits you so well. I know everything about you. And the little girl you brought to the hotel, what was that for? That's where she lives. She has only one brother, he's in prison. - I have orders from him to take care of her. - And the trunk? The trunk? Ah, the trunk was for you, a very special gift. You asked yourself questions, I hope, yes? And this woman who gave you money that night at Pigalle? Was that also deliberately for me? No, it was to pay for the kid's pension. I prefer that it's me who goes there. You're very handsome. You can't do that, I beg you. I beg you to let me come with you. I've never been in a prison. I won't say anything. And afterwards I won't bore you anymore, I swear. - You swear? - Yes yes. - Hello Antoine. - I'm the secretary. Hold on, here are your newspapers. Your cigarettes. - Ah, I'll introduce you: Juliette, Pierrot. - You have a wife? - Oh, that would be my girlfriend, but yes. - Oh, he's making fun of me. Monsieur Pierrot, look at me. Can't you see that I love him? - You're his friend, tell him. - Even if you don't believe her she's not faking. Antoine, don't spit on merchandise like that. Oh you're nice. Will I be able to come here again? Will you take me? Yes, we'll see, we'll see. Do you have letters? Here, there's a lion for Madame. Good, good, let's leave, eh. - Are you coming back soon? - Sure, Bill. - Goodbye Monsieur Pierrot. - Goodbye Juliette. - May I? - Oh. May I? It's good. It's lacking. He's cute. Did you see his eyelashes? It's disgusting, they're always men who have eyelashes like that. I want to see yours. Juliette, finish with your comedy, I'm in a hurry. - What did Pierrot do? - He killed a girl who embarrassed him. - No joking, what did he do? - A hold-up. Oh he's tremendous. Oh I love him, this Pierrot. Because I saw him looking at you like he admires you, like he loves you. Where are we going now? I love the salad. Do I come before or after the salad? But it's not at all the same thing. But if you had to choose. Frankly, between the salad and me? You of course. Naughty fatty, always looking for compliments. But no, but no. Hum, he makes a hypocrite. Tartuffe, go! - Who's that tickling my legs? - Not guilty. Oh, it's a dog. But I have nothing to give you, my poor one. What a funny dog. What breed is it? - Then it eats carrots. - Well, yes, like all rabbits. - Ah is this a rabbit? - Yes. Oh he is just like a rabbit. This is the first time that I've seen one. I must make a vow. - And then they'll be everywhere. - Well, yes, to finish the rest. But I've never seen them. In any case I'm already here. Yes yes, I know. By the way, who was this sinister type who was with you the other day? He has a head, I swear. - Me, even on a desert island I... - This is my father. You know you don't resemble him at all. But then I saw him from very far away. Are you really upset for your dad? But no! He's not my dad. He's a prosecutor for the republic. Antoine... it's horrible. Antoine, I want to kiss you. And then after? All day long it was the same: "I love you. "I love you, believe me, I always have!" "To my Antoine, my Tony, my Rodrigue, my Roro." He had to be terrified: "Stay back, Satan." [Latin] But not at all, he's only taken a taste of what can happen to me. We're apart more often. Besides, tonight we'll see each other again. Mmm, that feels good. You don't seem happy, despite my efforts. You don't love me at all, eh. But yes, you're very charming. Only I'm an old man and I have a lot of work to do. To the court when you pled, you were... Oh, I cried. Oh I like what you're eating. What. What you're eating. Oh you know it all. You're tremendous. When I think of all you've left me since that first night... Without being able to think of the first word. You must be tired at night. Oh, but not at all! Exactly, I came to ask you to take me out tonight. That will be nice. Then we're agreed? Oh, thank you. Oh no, not at all, not at all. I'm not free. - Are you going to Pigalle? - No, not tonight. Then where are you going? Well, I'm going out. - All alone? - No, with a girlfriend. Ah no, you can't do that without me! - Have you known her a long time? - Long enough. And you're not getting married again? So she doesn't please you. Then why do you waste your time with her? Good, then Juliette, if you would be so kind... as to go back to your place. I must change. What? You're going to change again for your little lady? But you're already good enough like that for her. Don't graze me like that. Juliette, this is vaudeville. I feel ridiculous, this is very unpleasant. Juliette, I'm a serious man with a lot of concerns. We have nothing to talk about. I have a boring head, filled with things that aren't very amusing. And you... you have a very pretty head with only levity, laughter. Kiss me. What a child you are. But if you were really in love with me you'd be ashamed. You wouldn't do a quarter of what you've done. You know me poorly. You again. I would have doubted myself. Vicky, I present you the Juliette in question. I followed you for two years. First with Madame and after, here. You don't have to make her wait a long time. Me, I always make them wait a long time. By the way, it's Stephen. What will I be able to drink? What are you drinking yourself? Huh, you haven't disgusted me. And well S?bastien, have a seat. It doesn't bother you when someone puts himself at your table? Ours is really so badly arranged. One sees nothing at all and one disturbs everyone when one wants to dance. Let's dance. You want to? - He's well-dressed, your S?bastien. - Yeah, sure. I'm very embarrassed, Juliette, because I'm about to get angry. And I don't like to get angry. Then be nice: take your S?bastien and get out. Are you in love with her then? I'm sure that I'm all red. Not at all, why? Because I do tapestry: everyone looks at me. They must all say that I don't please you. This is very annoying. Give me a dance. Afterwards, I'll leave. Yes Juliette. I'm terrible. - How hard-boiled. - How incredulous. Here it is. It's surely because he's a lawyer. He doesn't want to believe anything. Stop balancing yourself like that, you'll give me a heart attack. - It's to make me sleep. - Thanks, I know. But anyway, it still gives me a heart attack. Then what will you do now? Will you blackmail to suicide? No, I'm gonna catch him. And I will catch him. And after that I'll have this dirty phony. What's going on with you? I'm just sleepy. I prepared your breakfast. Juliette, I know no more. I don't know what to tell you, I'm flabbergasted. But how much longer will you continue this game? I made you the chocolate. I don't know if you like that, but it's so nourishing. It's good? You enter with your needle and thread, naturally. Naturally since this is Sunday and Rose isn't there on Sundays. Eight hours? But you have no pity. But to go to the country we must leave early! I brought a picnic, that'll give you a good breather. Ah no, my little Juliette, no. Today I have a thousand important things to do. I said no and that's no. Little sorceress, I can see you saying tonight: "Sophie, there it is, he kissed me. I had him!" Don't scream victory, you didn't have me. And you didn't win your wager or whatever it was. Let's say I profit from circumstances. From pretty circumstances. - You'll never believe that I love you then? - Oh no, never. Who would dare believe a liar like you? Not an old fox like me. - Do you believe? - Yes. Me, I believed, too. Now I no longer think. I don't have time anymore. It's beautiful, this stained glass. One would say you came descending from it. Is that a compliment? When I was young, very young, I wanted to be a priest. You're a lawyer, it's similar. And I like that better. I don't know if it's you or the chapel, but... right now I believe in God. It's nice to say that. Oh, I have something in my eye. Ah no, this time you won't have me. For me it's the same, because when I close my eyes it's as if it were you. Juliette, you can't do things like that. Make me a promise: that your little comedy is over. Why? Because. Because I'm too morose, and too worn out for that game. And then, so that I'm not hiding anything from you, I'm getting married. Oh, this is disgusting. And with who so suddenly? - With the young woman from last night. - Oh, no joke? Anyway, she made an effort to go after S?bastien. Yes, who's that guy you brought? I've never seen Vicky in that state before. Besides, I scolded him afterwards, he's a real Don Juan. Ah, but I chose him deliberately. He's an incurable case. First I wanted to care for him, then I dropped him, I didn't have the time. He stank more and more, it's terrible. He has other issues besides. At last I'm putting a stop to it and putting it off for the interim. - Afterwards, we'll find him something. - I understand nothing. They're replacing me for the newspaper. I'm too busy. For what? For me? Tell me Juliette, frankly, how did that happen? The day you were bored, you saw me in the stairway. You told yourself: "Hold on, what if I watched over..." Over? What did you call me? Tartuffe. Tartuffe? Tartuffe. You're right, let's drop it. You're too tough. The best jokes are the shortest ones. - Have you done so badly? - But leave me alone, I can manage by myself. You'll think again that this is one of my things to soften you. Don't be scared, that's all over. You're not very funny. You could have bored me for four days. You seem like you're just having a taste. I've had enough of the country. Not you? Juliette... Good, let's go. You're not with Tartuffe? Did you drop him? Is he not coming? Are you furious? Are you annoyed? Hold on, put your coffee there. Didn't you go to the newspaper? This is because of Tartuffe. Do you want to avenge yourself? His name is Antoine. Are you there again? Have you been waiting all day long? Anna, my sister Anne, if you love him, go talk to him. You're not so shy usually. Find something, make something up. You see, Sophie, I'll never make anything up again. And all of your beautiful theories? The theories are for when one has an empty heart. So then you love him, you love him... I know you. Amuse yourself and in 2 or 3 days you won't anymore. We're going out tonight. You're stupid. You don't want me to have any fun. Maybe I'm sad, but I'm not bored. I love someone. Come to bed, you'll catch a cold. Listen, I'm sure you please him too. It could very well be the first time. He's mannered in front of you, but he's crazy for you. But not at all. He doesn't let himself have my little things. He's a real man. He doesn't have eyes for little snobs like me. Besides, he's getting married. She must be a tremendous girl for him to love her. What do you think? - Nothing. - I think all the time, of you. I'm putting your coffee on the table. I have to go, Rose will arrive soon. By the way, why did she become such a madwoman the other night? Who's that my dear? Then, did you let her drop your mythomaniac? She doesn't have much perseverance. I wasn't amusing enough for her, she threw me out like a dirty old toy. You know how these charming dolls are, empty without a brain. Antoine, come a little closer to me. Mind the hours that you're on this balcony. Rom?o is going. What are you reading? Oh, idiocies. I'm really tired this time, a complete idiot. "Yes, I put myself at your knees "And do you want that I had it for you? "Our mouths touch, it's nothing "My laughter will depend on yours "To my dear for how little you cry "I swear to you hourly "We'll no longer be you and me "Out of whose eyes come tears "If one day I must leave you "Our hearts will be mortally wounded "And no one will think to guess "The first one to stop." Ah, that's pretty! Ah, how amusing. I'm having fun, are you having fun? But of course I am. Oh what an idiot. And well, the idiot loves Sophie and he doesn't deserve her. - Oh Sophie we must get married. - But why? I'm not very happy as you know. Time passes quickly. We would be good together. Speak for yourself, how egotistical. I don't love you, you know. Ah don't make yourself cry, it's disgusting. What an idiot, this guy. I said that is that. Usually you take everything as a joke. This is annoying to the very end. I tell myself: "If he really loved me?" Then I'm completely mean. This is the first time you've stopped laughing. And well, you see, I'm happy to have succeeded in stopping you. - Where are you going? - Oh don't do a thing, I'll return to my course, but today I've had enough. There's a car, you won't return on foot? Martin, give me a smile. Good, listen, if it does you any good, slap me if you want. No Sophie. I don't even want to slap you anymore. Oh but, what are you taking yourself for? You think that does something for me. This is all I said: aristocrat, snob, go! "Be kind." That'll teach me to be kind. Good, since you're there, hold on. I knew we'd finish by reconciling. For Martin. You must be a little patient. But this Juliette, she's stupid. She is... she is nothing. - No. - You said it yourself. Let's not speak of that anymore, alright? Let's not talk about it anymore, let's not talk about it anymore... Maybe you're not keeping track, but... in the past few days everything has changed between us. All because of a little slut who entered into your life... without asking you if the place was free. - Vicky. - You say "Vicky" and I hear "Juliette." But don't say anything stupid. Yes I think about her because... because she's pretty and I'm a man, that's all. - A little patience and all will be forgotten. - Antoine. Vicky. I'll be completely frank with you, Vicky. I won't say I love her because that's not me. That would be me if I were 18 years old. Because I think of her as one thinks about a girl when one is 18 years old, all the time. Only one of these days, thwack, I'll remember that I'm 40. And then she herself notices your old Antoine. Then you'll see, you'll look. I'd like you to take me back to the house. Hello Martin? This is Juliette leaving a message. Sophie isn't here, I'm taking the initiative in calling you. I know that you're angry with Sophie tonight... and that you resolved not to see her anymore. But I decided to call you because Sophie is very sad and very dejected. Juliette, I've suffered pain like that, don't you mock me. Martin, you're mistaken, she loves you. She doesn't tell you because she's stupid and proud. Come see me, I'm waiting for you. We'll find a way. Right away. What do you want? - Juliette isn't there? - She left. She didn't give you anything to tell me? Well, she called me earlier to come by and see her. You're sure? You take me for an idiot. You could have found better. - But I swear it's true. - And why this urgent call? Yes, she had me once again. - She made up a story, as always. - What, for example? - That you loved me, that you suffered. - What is she scheming up? Go away, I don't want to see you again. If I'd known you'd come I would've left. Go away. Good. Sophie. She set a trap for us, Juliette, we'll thank her for it. What did she say to you? That S?bastien was going to come, that she couldn't wait, that I must stay in the house to talk with him. - And where did she go? - To the com?die fran?aise. What are they performing there? Tartuffe. Vicky. Juliette. Juliette. Juliette. Hello Monsieur, here's your breakfast. Do you want coffee? Put the tray on the bed. Poor Rose, she didn't understand anything. Drink. Juliette. I want plenty of light.
