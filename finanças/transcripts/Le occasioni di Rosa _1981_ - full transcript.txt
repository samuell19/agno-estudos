Go to hell! l've had it! 30,000 liras?! What for? How are we supposed to live? Hock everything? You had a job and quit! Think you can eat off me forever? You're wrong! l'm not going back to any factory. Then marry, but get off my back! - Where's Tonino? - Over there. But watch it he's angry as hell. Hi, Tony. What do you want? 30 bills. At least 20. Forget it! And quit coming here breaking my balls. Angelo, it's 11 o'clock. Quit breaking. l was up all night working. lt's a professional stereo. Japanese, it's got zero distortion Powerful speakers, no kidding. Not just for music, you could play an atomic bomb. lt's really high class. You could get any price for it. lf you tried... l'm busy, gotta go to the poolroom. You took it and let it sit there a week, Tony. - Tony... Tony! - What? Sell it. lt cost me 100,000. You can sell it for 300. Anything Japanese is in, and you can't unload it? You changing life style? lt's been our bread for 3 years. Pasquale, that thing's not worth shit. They rooked you. He's so nosy last night he wouldn't let up. What a husband, always the same story. He can let up, l won't be sleeping here tonight. - Comb your hair. - Be good. - Take care. - Hi, Vincenzo. - He's there. - Wait here, Pasquale. Hey, l've been looking for you. l know. You order anything from the bar? Two whiskeys in the back room. What a nice surprise! Tony, you understand the situation. Don't worry. Have faith. l'll give you the money, l haven't got it now. ln a week. A week passes quickly, right? Don't make trouble. l like you, don't hassle me. You know Marisa, don't you? You don't. She's yours, take her as a favour to me. Do me this favour, take her. Do me this favour, take her. Want some? Want some? Where'd you pick her up? - Beat it! Beat it! - What's with you? You're crazy! Beat it! Beat it, you bitch! What a ball breaker you are! Don Raffaele... - What are you doing here? - What's on the menu? l can't listen to you. Gotta pick up your lady friends. What time is it? lt's 1 :30. lf there's room l'll come with you. Come on, wouldn't mind the company. There they are. You here? l'm Don Raffaele's aide-de-camp. May l introduce Patrizia a new colleague of ours. - Enchant√©! - Nice to meet you. Let's move it, it's cold out here. Please... Let's go, Don Raffaele. Excuse me! This sauce makes you forget earthquakes. - And me? - Arriving on track no. 2. See he didn't forget you. - l'm starving to death. - Good, huh? lt's very good tonight. He cooks very well. - Don Raffaele's got magic hands. - And a magic dipper. - Foul mouth! - Mind your own business. - Always spouting off. - You phoney. That man with much hair. Scoundrel! Try selling in some high class district. We're pretty enough, we are. - You make me laugh. - Me? You look like the neighbourhood hag, that's what. My companions are all beautiful women. - You're just jealous. - Get him! Such lovely little girls. l'm just too beautiful. - Not a hair. - Look. - How are you? - Not bad, thanks. Sit down, have a coffee. Rosa'll be ready in a minute. She tell you we had a fight? l don't want to interfere, but if the factory's out, she has to find another job. Won't be easy. but she can't keep this up. Can't talk to her. She's stubborn as a mule. Won't listen to anyone. l'm ready. Nice surprise! Up early today, Monica. Artists at work! Come on in. No, no! Not like that! Not like that! Won't do! What a bore! - Tony! - Hi, Pasquale. - Hey Rosa, how are you doing? - Don't stop. We'll go there. How are you? Want some whiskey? - What are you doing? - Wait, l'll show you something really nice. No, Jeeze! You move like a broomstick. lt's not sinuous. l've already shown you. - Here. - Just a sec. - You like it? - How nice! lt clings to your whole body. Lend it to me. - You always want everything. - Lend it. Come in, Tony, come in. Have a seat. Very posh. Business is booming. You think it's easy? All you do is send me a message. Had to turn Naples upside down! - How much you want? - Three plus one. l measured by eye, my scale's broken. A little expensive, l know, but top quality. Sugar brown. lt's hard to find And the coke's a giveaway. Come on in, kids. Sit down. l'll get you something. l'll be right back. Rosa, sit down. - Want anything? - l've already had enough tonight. - You drinking? - No, later. - Can l take a look around? - Sure. - Good stuff? - Very good. Here. - lt's strong? - No, l put just a little. Tony, get a load of this film! Get a load of this film! Knew it. Get up, kiddies, it's 9:30. - What?! - This is a special day! No more staying up nights! l'm free. That turd where l work fired me. Great news, huh?! We've got to celebrate! Relax, l'll fix you breakfast. No, l'm in a hurry. This bill's urgent, give it to the accountant. The truck's coming with new merchandise. Don't unload it all here. Send half to the warehouse. Don't worry. Hi, Tony. Come in. - Be with you in a minute. - Okay. And tell the accountant that tonight l want the books for the month, every entry. - You telling what the surprise is? - No, not yet. First we're going to the cemetery. - The cemetery? - Yes, the cemetery. ln memory of my mother. l come every year and l have a Mass said. Here you are. - Like it? - What did it cost? When you sail, like l did, on tankers or cargo ships, after so many trips, so many ports your memory gets confused. But Aden was totally different, a kind of inferno. Three days at anchor. They wouldn't let us dock. So it was me who finally said we should strike. Seems striking isn't allowed on ships, so the next day everything finished in shit. They dumped me and sent me back to Naples. ln Cairo, while waiting for the plane, l remembered it was my birthday. 22 years old! Who's that? Wait. Hello? Oh, hi. Just a minute. lt's Pasquale, he wants you. - Ask him to tell you. - She's busy. What is it? How 'bout a concert tonight? Yeah. Have him come later. Hear that? She said to drop by later. Yeah. She'll go. Okay. Okay, bye. So? He has these tickets for a concert. No, before you said you remembered your birthday. Yeah, it was my birthday. So l downed a bottle of champagne. - You never sailed again? - Not that easy. Once you queer it, you're blacklisted and don't work anymore. Hey, you getting up? Don't feel like doing a fucking thing today. l like having you around. l wake you? No, l was already awake. - Tonino's sleeping? - Yes. Want to breathe? - He's not here. - l've had it! You're gonna get your money tonight. You'll see, we'll find that shit. Give me a good one. Go smooth. Give me all aces. - Later, Raffaele. - Still the best ones. What do you know! Been looking for you all night. l'm here, where l always am just playing cards. Have a seat. A beer for our friend! Don't hurt him. His sweet little kisser's very delicate. He wanted his money. Watch his head! How'd you want it? Wanted it in cash? Was that it? Cash on the line? He's got a motorcycle sitting outside brand new Hello? lt's me, Tony Yes, Tonino. You go looking for trouble. What's in it for you? Why do it? Drink, it'll do you good. Tomorrow l'm reporting the theft of the motorcycle. - No, you're not! - l paid 2 million for it. lt's in my name. You're not reporting anything or l'll push your face in. You threatening me? ls that the thanks l get? You want another cycle? Where you going? l don't want to see you again. Hit me. lf you've got the courage. l've decided, l'm setting up here, at Angelo's. l'm tired of sleeping one night here, one night there. l need some peace and quiet. You move in too. What are you doing at your sister's? We should all be together. You know, my house is yours. Who is this Angelo? Where's his house? - Have something to eat. - No, Tony's waiting for me downstairs. - Bye, Peppino. - Bye, Rosa. We'll see each other. l'm not going to America. Two orange pops, please. Here. Just a sec. l'll take you home. No. l need money right now. so if you have any friends, have them call me. - Give me the plates. - They're here. That's Rosa. Get another dish. You're soaked! ls it really pouring? - Eat something. - l'm not hungry. l'm going to bed. Dry your hair. The dryer's in the bathroom. Where is the money? - You take the money from the drawer? - No. Did you look carefully? 200,000 liras. They were under the book. Here's where they ended up. He could have given us a sniff! He's a big shot. Heads a private hospital. Married, with 3 kids. Anyway, for a whole week he was seeing Monica every night. He's really hooked. Gives her gifts, the works. - This one's good. - Just print them all up. l figure we can make a pile. lt wasn't easy taking those pictures, but now: ''Dear Doctor, seems you're in love with a transvestite.'' ''lf you want the negatives, pay up''. - And Monica? - What about Monica? He can't do anything to anybody, we've got the pictures. lt's simple. A letter's not enough. He needs a good scare. That's your job, l can't hack it. There, that's his house. Not bad, huh? You decide. We can burn his car, kill his dog. A nice warning, so he knows we mean business. You're nuts. These people got connections, they don't scare. And what for? One or two million? To divvy in how many parts? Tony, the guy's filthy rich. - You still got earthquake shock. - Yes, l do. Hi, Rosa. Want a lift? Please, l have to talk to you. Like it? - Want another? - lt's good, not too much rum. Another rum baba. l'm really worried about Tony. The last time l saw him, that night, he was like a madman. He'll do something stupid. Tell him l didn't report the motorcycle. lf he wants, l'll buy him another. Rosa, help me. We're not rivals, we should be allies. l love Tony like a father. As long as he's with me, you won't lose him. Understand me, Rosa? - l'd like some water. - ln a minute. l met Gino. - He offered me 2 rum babas. - Where did you meet him? He gave me a lift. He didn't report the motorcycle. What a shithead! Yeah, but he's nice, real refined a gentleman. Fuck both of you! - The sheets? - ln the bathroom. What's this? We're getting up a little bar. Get some glasses. Here. - lt's nice. - Perfect! - l'll split. - Wait a minute. - That's him. Wait a minute! l have an appointment with Rosa. l'm Rosa, come in. Sit down. - Good morning. - Good morning. Have a seat. Want something to drink? A whiskey, an aperitif? - Yes, please. - l'll get it. A whiskey? A little. - And you? - No, thanks. l'll be going, excuse me. - l'll see you out. Excuse me. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Till tonight. - No, l'll finish with him in half an hour. - Okay, bye. - Bye. A real oddball. Before going he asked me: ''ls he your brother?''. Got any money? l'll show you something you haven't seen. Two pieces of cake, please. Put it on. - Thank you. - You're welcome. This is it. Things can't go on like before. All right. l'm not asking anything. All l want is... Now listen carefully. l've got this garage. Right now, l'm subletting, but it's a good business. Someone has to run it. lt's yours. lt's good, clean money with lots of free time. lt's up to you. No more worries, you could get married. Rosa's really exceptional, she loves you, like l love you. Have a child. l'll take care of everything. The house is no problem. There's an empty apartment below mine, exact same layout. You just marry and have a baby. All l ask is a child, your child. l went to the unemployment office. Weren't you already signed up? Not on the federal lists. Won't do any good. l just wanted to see. l was in line 3 hours. This guy said: ''lf they paid for my time in line,'' ''l'd be rich.'' - Can l sign up too? - Sure. lf you want to waste time. Leave everything, l'll clean the kitchen. Okay, l'll straighten up the bedroom. What a drag! - Angelo! - What now? Angelo! - What is it? - Where did you find it? - Under the bed. - lt's a sextant. - Stop it. - Let me see. lt's a sextant. - What's it for? - When you're at sea, you can find out the ship's position. This is the eyepiece. - Let me see. - Just a sec. You look at the sun, the moon, or a star and then you can calculate the ship's position. - Let me see. - Take a look. - See it's sectioned off. - l don't see anything. You don't see anything? Now? What you need it for? Who knows, some day l might sail the ocean wide. - Huh? - Some other time. That's Tonino. Let me hide it. He's likely to sell it. Tony, that you? - Where were you? - Not your business. - You're always late. - Hi, Tony. - Hi, Angelo. - A whiskey? - Yeah, a little. - And you, Rosa? - No, thanks. Thanks, Angelo. - Holy shit, is it real? - lt is. - lt expensive? - Sure is. Then tonight you'll have to pay me. l'm not kidding. 50,000 liras or we're not screwing. You'll sleep on the sofa and l'll go with Angelo. Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Let go! You mother! What a fucking turd! Fuck you! What a fucking turd! Let's get married. Want this in your face? Thought you wanted to marry. Now's the right time. - Hi. - Hi. - Happy birthday. - Thanks, they're beautiful. - Many more. Come on in, there's some hot chocolate. Sit down. Have some. Peppino made it for my birthday. - Hey, Peppino! - Hi, Peppino. There are some cookies. - Tonino, have some chocolate. - Thanks. - We eating here? - No, Vincenzo invited us all out. Can you pass me the wine? Some cheese, please. Getting married! lt doesn't seem possible. l've been asking you for years. That's different. Besides, you're not the father of my children. - Where's Tony? - He's busy. How come?! Last night l gave him directions for getting here. - l didn't know. - How did you come? - On the bus. - Let's go. - How 'bout this? - No, don't like it. This is elegant. lt's not what l had in mind. This is nice. Find anything you like? - This style? - Baroque. lsn't it too old-fashioned? What's it cost? That's no problem. lf it's a question of style, the showroom upstairs is full of modern furniture. You sell colour televisions? Where's the switch? - Wonder if they brought everything. - Of course they did. Gino said all that's missing are the curtains. The TV? Haven't they brought it? lt's here in the kitchen! - Jeeze! - lt's an American style kitchen. Mama's suggestion. Let's put the TV in the bedroom. No, the living room. - lt's more fun in the bedroom. - Ah, come on! Put it in the living room like everyone else. - You eat? - Yeah. Good. There's nothing in the house. That's Gino. He's been by three times already. - Come in. - No thanks. l happened to see you come in. Tomorrow l'm going to the garage. - Got some news. - Such as? We'll talk tomorrow, go to bed now. Good night. - Good night. - Bye. Wake up, kiddies, wake up. Get up. lt's a beautiful day today. lt's 10 o'clock. Get with it! Coffee's on its way! Good morning. - She expecting? - How should l know? Please, move it from here. l talked to the architect. lf we open up towards the courtyard, we expand by 200 square meters. We'll have to pay off the condominium, cause it's not legal. What we need is an auto repair shop or a body shop. Then you're really talking business. Good idea that! lt's going to take some figuring, but it's possible. l'm happy to see that this work suits you. Hello? Miss? Oh, fine. l can come? You open this afternoon? Okay. Thank you. Goodbye. Put it on the chair. - You go to the doctor's? - No. Well then go. You gotta be careful now. Girls today are more delicate than we were. Babies used to come flying out. You took 15 minutes, to the second. Here, with a midwife. No hospital. Don't ever forget that this child, boy or girl, is a blessing. ln your setup, with a husband who's too young and this Gino fellow, don't tell me his part in this, this child is a gift from God. Children set everything straight. Remember that. Let me see you. You're looking good. Come in. - Have a seat. - What's this? You leaving? Sit down. Yes, in three days. l found a ship. For how long? Three or four years. To set aside some money. - Three or four years?! - One sec. Here, have a chocolate. They're good. What's wrong? - l'm pregnant. - That's wonderful! l'm not sure. - What are you gonna do? - l'm not sure. l don't feel like talking. What's wrong? Can l help? No, just wanted you to know. l was gonna celebrate tonight. Want to come with, or go home? - We could go out for a bite. - Okay. Tony! - How 'bout you? - No. A little sniff. Go down, it's getting late. l'm pregnant. Tell Gino. You'll make him happy. - Why tell him? - Tell him. l want to know how you feel. Fuck Gino! Come off it. You know the score. - How do you feel about it? - lt's up to you. Fuck Gino and fuck you too! Here are some magazines. And remember, stay in bed. You heard the doctor, you've got to be careful. l'll bring you something for lunch. Don't read too much, rest a little too. You leaving? Can you give me a lift? No, l'm in a hurry. Okay, see you tonight. - Need anything? - No. Go to hell! Monica? That you? Hi. Well? 5 o'clock? You come too, please. No, meet me here. Okay. Bye. lt's special! Fresh bass. 12,000 liras a pound. lt's good with lemon. l'll stay here this afternoon, keep you company. - No, l'm going out. - Going out? Don't you understand you've got to be careful? Gino, come here! - Gino! - l'm coming. What is it? Sit there. Polish my toenails, l can't do it. l don't know how. lt's easy. Never did it. That all right? See how simple it is? Why you going out? Where to? lf you're tired of staying in bed, get up, walk around the place, watch a little TV. Why go out? Watch it, the polish is dripping. Don't worry. lt's nothing. ln half an hour it'll be all over. lt's not possible! lt's not possible! We had lunch together. Even seemed happy. Didn't you give any thought to the life inside you?! That innocent creature, who wasn't only yours?! Whore! Only a whore could do that! Make him shut up, please. Whore! You hurt me! Leave me! You hurt me! What you want? Leave me! Leave me! You hurt me! What you want? Leave me!
