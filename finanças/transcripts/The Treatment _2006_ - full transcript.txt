Julia. Jake! Jesus, this is so weird. - I know, it's a big city. -Small world. No, no, no, no, I was, uh, I was gonna call you, actually. -Really? -Yeah. Julia, that--that's great because I've been thinking about it. Oh, I... I'm engaged. I wanted you to hear it from me. -Who is it? -You don't know him. It's a good thing, be happy for me. No, don't do this, Julia. Oh, you don't do this. - I do not need this baggage. -I promise... Oh, God, after what you put me through, I deserve all the happiness I can get. I remember you used to say that we were only happy when we were being miserable together. That's funny, I remember you used to say that. Uh, look, the wedding is in Aspen. But some friends are giving us a going away party. You can come if you promise to behave. Yeah, I'll behave like exemplary baggage. For example, I won't tell anyone how your last boyfriend dumped you after you called him "Jake." Oh, that is not what happened, you jerk. He panicked when you told him you had syphilis. But you could've told him the truth. You just weren't over me. Well, that's true, but I had some help and now I am. How about you, are you seeing anybody? Yeah, sure, no, I've been on a few dates. No, I mean therapy. Are you seeing a shrink? Ugh, I gotta go. I hope you're at the party. One, two... ...three. Please come in, Mr. Singer. Sorry I'm late, Doc. This crazy fat woman tried to avoid paying for the bus. Life in the city, huh? Tell me, Mr. Singer... why you think this woman, if she exists, is so fat? I don't know, maybe it's something glandular or her metabolism. So you're apologizing for her and yourself, is that right? -What do you mean? -"I suppose, maybe, I guess." Constructing passive sentences is a way of concealing your own testicles lest someone cut them off. -Why you laugh? -Maybe it's because... Again, "maybe." -You disavow your feelings. - I do not... You make from the world a banal comedy, and you are a spectator. You even have a name for it; "Life in the City." Bravo. Doc, with all due respect, I don't mean to question your methods, but at $125 a pop-- And I appreciate the sliding scale, really, I do-- but all we ever do is discuss my manners and my dead mother and she's been dead quite a while. We rarely discuss my almost non-existent sex life, my ambivalence about my job, my distrust of my boss, my almost total lack of communication with my father. Are you gonna stop me? You can discontinue the treatment or continue with this disputatious resistance until your bank account is drained. It's the same to me. Dr. Morales, I need to reschedule our appointment for next... Okay, I am angry. Oh, Jesus Christus, thank you for this blood in the groin. Why? I saw Julia this morning. She's gone for good. She's getting married. At last, the penis has entered the vagina. I just don't see what the big deal is. I mean, why did Chekhov have to write about such total losers? Yeah, I mean like that guy in the play, he walks around moping all day while his land rots and his wife suffers. Then some young beautiful girl falls in love with him and we're supposed to feel sorry for him? No way, that's ridiculous. Today we'd just give the dude a Prozac and tell him to get on with it. I don't think the play would ever have been written. No, you're right, Phil, why don't we just start a whole new category of literature that's been made irrelevant by modern pharmacology? We could start with Moby Dick. We'll just give Ahab a Zoloft to take the edge off. Invisible Man, he's a Paxil candidate -if I ever saw one. -I'm not sure... What exactly do you want from us, Mr. Singer? For a start, I want you not to process literature like you're solving an equation. Chris, how do we define "humanism"? "A belief in social responsibility, individualism, and the uses of sympathy and the imagination." Good. Walter, do you think it's the point of drama to portray characters so that we can sit back and judge them? No. We're supposed to, like, feel what they feel. Good. Read. "Sympatheia, or emotional identification, is necessary if we are to feel pity or fear, which are forms of pleasure.‚Äù Aristotle prizes emotional power over all else. The playwright is offering you an experience. All I ask is that you be open to it. You have to imagine that you could be Ivanov, that you could feel that helpless and that defeated, and that someone else could see the good in you even though you clearly failed to make it manifest in the world. So, um, is it okay to take two extra days for my essay, Mr. Singer? Bye, Mom, I'm late. -Bye. -Mr. Singer? What? Uh, yeah, sure, go ahead. Just don't make a habit of it. -Can I help you? -Yes. I seem to have lost my way here. Well, me too, and I work here. Where's the headmaster's office? Ooh, what'd you do? -Uh, no, he's a friend. -Really? -Does he not have friends? -No, no, no, he has friends. I just didn't think he had friends quite like you. Well, he's my, uh, my husband's... My son is a student here. Ah, so he's in trouble too? I don't think I got your name. Jake Singer. English and basketball. Oh, I thought maybe you were the hall monitor. No, no, no, we've done away with those, including mandatory Latin and corporal punishment. I'm Allegra Marshall. It is very nice to meet you, Mrs. Marshall. Uh, Proctor's office is right down here. So, I'm trying to get more involved in the school. Oh, that's great, um... Prompted by anything in particular? Well, my, um, son's had some difficulties, but he loves school. He's only eight, and we're still very attached. Well, these things take cooperation. There are a lot of parents who would rather write a check or have someone write a prescription to solve a problem. I suppose you're right. -Allegra. -Leighton. I see you've met Mr. Singer. Yes, we were exchanging some potent ideas about education. Well, I'd like to hear them too. Why don't you expand a bit at Mrs. Marshall's next Sunday, the benefactors' luncheon? Mm, it's settled then. Tell the others we'll start in 15 minutes, Mr. Singer. -It was nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you too. Come on. Come on, don't let 'em muscle you that way! Ladies... Ladies, you're getting killed on both ends. You, Alex, I want you to front your guy, all right? Get a body on him, he's big. Don't be intimidated by him. Come on, let's challenge their zone a little bit, get on the inside, take it to the paint, all right? Drive it a little bit, all right? All right, for God's sake, Walter, will you please get back on defense, huh? All right, let's go, come on. Come on. One, two, three, work! Maybe you should ease up a little bit on Walter. He's trying, but it's tough. You know, if it was easy, what would be the point? Why don't you stick to the stats? Let me do the coaching. Walter, get back on D. That's it, hands up and swag. Justin, you got to call that pick! Call switch, come on. Back, back, back, back! Everybody, back on the bench. Right, right, right, Coventry, walk away, walk away. Come on, come on. Folks... Well, naturally, we're all concerned about what happened at the game yesterday. We're here to discuss whether we ought to give Walter Cooper the benefit of the doubt. There's no doubt, he did it on purpose. He says he didn't. He sent a kid to the hospital last year. No, no, no, that other kid started with him. He's a year older than his grade. He's shown no feelings for school. Let's face it, he's a time bomb. He is smarter than half of my kids, and he says that you ignore him in class, Bill. I can't pull the answers out of him. I've got a class to run. I had reservations about Walter-- Excuse me, it was you who, after the interview, said we should give him a chance, that he's a fine, upstanding young man. We could give him the opportunity to rise above his circumstances. Excuse me, I didn't know I was speaking before the FBI. We'll discuss this later. Mr. Singer, in the future, I'll expect fewer contradictions and more contributions. Just try and help us keep him out of trouble, and don't make me regret asking you to speak next Sunday. I mean, what a hypocrite. Proctor took this kid for his shooting percentage, and then he gets furious at me for telling the truth? -Outrageous. -The man doesn't have an ounce of self-awareness. I was speaking of you, Mr. Singer. -I was outrageous? -I'd have fired you on the spot. Well, consider me fired. Why is it every time I think I'm getting somewhere you pull the rug out from under me? Because that is the way you insist upon seeing the help that I'm trying to give you. You're a sadist. You are an expensive sadist. For the good Christ's sake, Mr. Singer, do you need to be told so badly that I love you? -You love me? -Yes. Now sit down, please. Now, we are part of the natural order, primates, with hierarchies, rituals of behavior. Now most important is the mounting behavior. And this you see most flamboyantly with baboons. The dominant male mounts not only the females but also the lower males. Now if a lower male wishes to challenge for leadership, he must do it with cunning and patience, -not direct defiance. -What about the truth? I mean, Proctor did say that-- This childish insistence on the truth. You should be mastering these conflicts instead of continuing to seek shelter in them from the professional success you might so easily attain. You think that I could easily... Ernestito, are you coming over later? I'll see you Tuesday. Mr. Singer... My love is not a shield. It is a sword. Whoa there, Kemosabe. Me no trust Yankee firewater before me give speech, hm? These people are of a different species. They were mixing martinis in the womb. Hey, you want me to go first? Um, yeah, would you? I don't know what's gotten into me. Not hungry, Mr. Singer? Oh, I can't eat yet. It's Jake. Jake, would you rather be alone to go over your speech? Well, I'm sure you have guests to attend to. You're one of them. I'm sorry, I'm just feeling a little bereft of small talk right now. So, what are you teaching at school? Um, we are up to the Romantics. Wordsworth and Shelley, not the pop group. Well, "What I Like About You" doesn't require much explanation. So, what about the poets? -Really? -Really. Um, they were obsessed with nature, uh, using it as a metaphor for the inner life. So, the "sanguine sunset," the "dark battling clouds." Nature, for them, was a mirror of the inner life, both light and dark. And now is your chance to escape. I was actually enjoying it, but maybe you're the one who wants to escape. Are you nervous or something? I guess. What? What's wrong? My insane Argentinean analyst doesn't want me to use words like "I guess" or to guess. And I probably shouldn't be invoking him either. Sounds stern, your analyst. -Are there other kinds? -I guess. I thought he was supposed to make you feel more comfortable in your own skin, no? Mm, no, he's more the exfoliating type. I thought teachers were good at public speaking. Well, in a classroom, no problem, but... I mean, in there, the maid's room is bigger than my apartment. Um, I'm sorry, that was rude. A little. Look, Mrs. Marshall, can we just forget about-- Allegra. And I was actually enjoying it. Honesty is good. But, um, I just--I wish I could make you feel more comfortable. Uh, actually, you have. I can't imagine I could be more of an asshole today, so... Still early. I'll see you inside. Just a minute. Quite so, Mr. Singer. Take a minute. Could you not see how you push away this woman for daring to be interested in you? Interested? No, fake interest is more like it, Doc. New York is full of people with lousy boundaries. But why you not listen to her and speak with more honesty? Because that's not what they want. They want the rah, rah, rah, buff-up the hood ornament speech. If it's so boring and so stupid, why you cry in fear beforehand? Who's crying? Cramps, diarrhea. You're grown-up, so you do it through your asshole. -Everything all right? -Yeah. Fine. Hey, tell me, which one is her husband? You don't know? He's dead. What happened? Was he in an accident? He couldn't have been that old. Forty-two. Massive coronary. She inherited his seat on the board and I guess she wants to keep it. ...to afford the kind of diversity in our student body in keeping with our mission and make our school a mirror of the values we want in our own society. To be honest, I never thought that I would be a teacher at a place like Coventry. When I was young, my mom died, and I had a lot of bumpy years, but I was lucky enough to have some really great teachers, and school became my ballast. So, when I became a teacher, I realized that if we're gonna change this world, we have to do it from the bottom and from the top. It's like when John F. Kennedy said, "With great privilege comes great responsibility." Great young people don't just happen. They come from an environment where they've... been challenged and nurtured. -Great job. -Thanks. Really, great job. Thank you. The score remains exactly 97 to 98. No more cookies, Alex. Why do they foul so much? Mm, that's a good question. Either he thought they could get way with it or he didn't know he did it. Either way, it's still part of the game. I'm glad your appetite has returned. Oh, everything is delicious. Um, listen, I want to apologize. I had no idea about your husband. I thought you were the one person brave enough to talk to me about something else. -I'll be happy to do that. -Hey, Jake, why was that a foul? Uh, some of the guests have questions for you, but apparently so does Alex. Ask. I had no idea she was a widow. And you found it easier to flirt when you thought she was married? This is backward, Mr. Singer. I gave them what they wanted. Look, the whole thing, it's just a bunch-- Bullshit. Mm. Are you not tired of preventing yourself from a genuine involvement in your feelings and your life? Yes. Simple honesty. Before you evade your feelings again, tell me, will you pursue the healthy sexual interest between you and this dowager? That is an antiquated term. Or have you already lost interest because, in fact, she's available? I don't understand. My SAT scores are, like... Are not the same thing as doing well in English class. But I spent the whole summer doing practice exams. I mean, that should be enough-- Tell me something, did you read just one book during that time just for fun? My dad thinks reading fiction is a waste of time. Now he's on my back like crazy. Do me a favor, just read the Chekhov play. I don't care if you hate it. -Just read it. -Yes, Mrs. Marshall. No, no, no, he's probably just got the same bug as you and the babysitter. Oh, hang on. No, no, I would love to take him home myself, but, you know, with four people here already sick, -I better not leave. -I've got a free period. I can take him home, I know Mrs. Marshall. -It'll be okay. -Hang on, Mrs. Marshall. We're trying to get this poor boy home, if you don't mind, Mr. Singer. -I'm sick. -I know, but you're gonna get better. My dad was sick and he died. That was very sad but also very rare. My sister doesn't even realize. She's too little. She thinks my mom is gonna be one of those single mothers. Well, when your sister gets older, you can tell her about her dad. Hi, sweetie. Mm, go lie down. I'll be right inside, okay? Oh, thank you so much, Mr. Singer. Oh, no, it was no problem. He's a great kid, and it's Jake, remember? Of course. Jake, let me, uh, give you some money for the taxi. -No, please, please, please. -I insist. Thank you. Um, well, at least let me go get you some wonton soup or something. -It always works for me. -Oh, that's so sweet, but, um, we're already making some, we're fine. Oh, right, you're probably covered. Well, I wish I could get you something, but I know that sounds silly. Why is that silly? Well, what could I get that you don't already have? Try using your imagination. Okay, I can do that. Okay, thank you for bringing my boy home. Bye. "Oh, you are so charming, Mr. Singer. Why do you not teach in charm school?" Mr. Singer? -Mr. Singer! -Sorry. It's just such a pretty day. Well, let us follow your attention, then, go outside for a walk. Serious? The two of us? Are you joking? There are no jokes in here, Mr. Singer. I thought this whole process was supposed to be more sympathetic. You want somebody to be kind to you? Is that what you want? But that's not my function. What I can do, if you permit it, is to help you obtain this intimacy from others. But you must give it more time. We're doing the hard work of clearing away all the muck of denial, repression, and fear. I heard medication works for some people. In your case, it would be a rank convenience. No, if only you can face your issues directly, you will be capable of love, wisdom... satisfaction of work, wealth, and sex of the most hot and juicy variety. Now I'm sorry, but that is the end of the session. I must return, but please, don't stop the treatment. Well, look who the cat dragged in. Some of you may know the infamous Jake Singer. -Hi. -Congratulations. Thank you. Andre, this is Jake. -Jake, Andre. -How you doing? So you see, Andre, now you have two of Julia's exes here tonight to wish you the best. Does that speak well of Julia or what? Speaks well of her as an ex. On that note, here is to Julia, and her final beau and never-to-be ex, Andre: A long and happy life together. -Cheers. -Cheers. Salut. Jake, I've heard so much about you. Well, I hope at least some of it was good. Oh, it's all good. It's part of who Julia is, and I love all of her. Aw, thank you. Your turn. Well, in case some of you don't know about Julia's other interests, um, I found this photo a few days ago. You can pass it around. Always the teacher. That was taken the year that we were teaching in Brazil, and the kids in the background showed a newfound interest in literacy when Julia was teaching the class. And it was a great year for us, um, trying to figure out where we fit in and how we were gonna change the world. And you know, maybe we let our ideals run away with us, but I do know that at the end of a year at least 15 kids learned to think for themselves and I learned that I could make a difference, and none of that would've happened if not for Julia. So I'm forever in her debt. And, um, I also hope that that year means as much to her as it does to me. Um, and so cheers to your new life together. -Cheers. -Cheers. -Here, here. -Thank you. 25 seconds left. Hold it. Hold the ball before you take the shot! Run it down, Walter, you hear me? I want you to run it down! No! All right, get back, get back! What was that, huh? Can't listen? What is that Walter, huh? What did I tell you? You hold the ball with 10 seconds left, they don't get it back. You gotta use your head once in a while, -use your fucking head. -Coach, he had the open shot. -Oh yeah? -22 points, 9 assists. Lay off him. It's called following orders, Cooper, being part of a team. You wanna showboat, go on back to the playground where we found you. -Just ignore him, Walter. -Who asked you, Singer? I'm the coach here, you skinny fuck. Walter! -Oh shit, Mr. Singer. -Oh Christ. Somebody call a doctor, call an ambulance! My father's a doctor. No, I--I think I'm gonna be fine. Hold on a second. Uh, Jeff, I gotta call you back. -Hi. -Hi. Uh, I should've called, but uh, the doorman says just to come up. The door--oh, that's Tim. He's just the superintendent. How--how's Alex? Oh, he's fine, thanks. What about you? I can't believe you put your head in the way of that stupid coach. Yeah, well, at least it's good for something. Uh, do--do you wanna come in? Yeah, thank you. Well, my maid would be very happy here. Uh, I--I can offer you some dry cereal, ginger ale, um, ibuprofen. -Oh, no, um-- -Oh, here, here. Thank you, I'm fine. So I, uh--I brought you some soup and a book. Uh, what kind of soup? -Oh, I can't tell you exactly. -Why not? Wow, that's a lot of garlic. Yeah, and a few mystery ingredients I can't divulge, let alone pronounce. Uh, who has the secret? Oh, this, um, lovely woman in Guatemala. That seems awfully far to go for a cooking class. Well, I went down there, um, as a hurricane relief worker, and, uh, drank some bad water, got really sick, so she fed me this soup. And then I came up with the idea to put out a book of local cures to raise money. I was gonna call it Recipes of Necessity. That's a good idea. Uh, yeah. Well, then I got married. Where'd you get this? Oh, I was in the office at school and I saw your inbox, so, um, I borrowed it. I loaned it to Walter, I wonder if he read it. How'd you like it? It's a long way from the Romantic poets, but, uh, I liked it. I mean, he redrew the landscape, right? Placed equal emphasis on what's not said. Yeah, that's right. It was written in the margin. Can I help you? Yeah, why don't you cut the mushrooms? So, what'd you think of it? Um, I liked his, uh-- His style. It was so direct, emotionally. Oh, yeah, uh, he's ruthless. -Sorry. -Just not quite as small. Will you please kiss me, please? Which sexual positions did you use? Excuse me? Well, you did fuck, didn't you? Yes, as a matter of fact. Well, did you, as a matter of fact, enjoy it? Greatly, I quite enjoyed it. -She have a climax? -Oh, what is this, -a locker room? -Well, what is wrong with this? I teach high school, I try not to linger in it. This is often the only chance young men in this culture have to discuss such matters, however crudely. I just don't see why it's important. Why would anything that marks you as a member of the human race count as important? No, with your suffering, you have evolved. Perhaps you belong up there. Oh, I--I didn't mean that-- No, then will you please stop pretending that you are unfamiliar with these terms? And I don't see why I need to convince you the importance of your first sexual encounter in almost a year. Thanks, Doc. I should go. Uh, yeah, I was afraid you were gonna say that. Can--can we take it slow? I mean, if you'd like to go on. Uh, yeah. Wait, what do you mean? Just like to be careful not to confuse the kids. Not just the kids. Were you happy with your husband? We had good times, yeah. But we also struggled. Both my kids are adopted. Did he want kids as much as you did? A little less when he found out he couldn't have his own. But he loved Alex. Yeah, he's a good kid. Emily, though, oh wow, she looks like trouble. Hey, hey. I'm kidding. Emily's adoption isn't final. What do you mean? Well, we're-- We're supposed to be a two-parent family, but, um, George passed away before-- The adoption agency doesn't know your husband's dead? Oh, I-- I know it's not smart. Well, how--how have you managed to keep them from figuring it out? Uh, before the state grants me custody, the agency's supposed to do a final home check-up. I've been dodging them so far. That seems risky. I know. Sometimes you just react. I love Emily so much. I couldn't bear to lose her. I'm just not sure I should've done it. It--it was fun, but she's obviously very vulnerable. You think you're protecting an endangered bird, when in fact she's a rising phoenix, and you are under the dog. I--I'm her dog, is that what you're saying? You began this liaison by pointing out her wealth. No, just my lack of it. You refused to dine with her and her guests, with her preferring to eat with the-- -The maids in the kitchen. -I don't divide the world into maids and-- Well, that's very conscientious of you, Mr. Singer. I will alert the media. Hey, fuck you! You know, if it's so important for me to finally get laid, why are you making me feel weird about it? I mean, do--do you have a wife? Do you have a life? Or am I just some sort of pathetic, lousy excuse for one? Are you through? No, and get a goddamn answering machine that works. I think you could afford it. Next week is Valentine's Day. I'm not getting you a gift. Last Valentine's Day card I made was for my mother and she died. The lover in you is badly malnourished. And the self-pitying side is overfed. Why don't you do something romantic? -Court the widow. -What, now? You think we should--? Well, keep things light. Enjoy yourself, but don't get too entangled. Are you thinking of your parents, Mr. Singer? -What? -What was that? -Someone come in here? -No, no, no, no, no. Don't worry, the door's locked. It's probably the maid or something. Are you afraid there must be punishment after this domestic sex? Mom! I'm home. Uh, sweetie, I'll be-- I'll be out in a second, okay? Uh, Mommy just got out of the shower. -Don't stop. -He's right outside. Oh, come on. It feels good with you inside of me in the daytime, can't I have that? -Yeah, but-- -So don't punish me, Jake. Fuck me. Alas, your sainted mother... ...was also a sexual being. Mom, can me and Jeffrey have a Devil Dog? Your parents had to fuck and suck to make you. Grandma says I have to ask you. Grandma? Sh, sh. My mother-in-law, it's okay. Oh, we can't--we can't do this, we can't do this. Oh, come on. They chose their life, Mr. Singer, and they lived it. Mom! Uh, tell Grandma you can have one Devil Dog! Come around the other side. It'll look like you were in the office. Hey, Claire. I thought you were taking them to the children's museum. I was, but the boys wanted to stop home for a snack first, -and I-- -Thought you'd check up on me? I needed the restroom anyway. Hi, guys. -Hey, this is Jeffrey. -Hi, Jeffrey. Hey, aren't you a teacher at school? I am, yeah, I am also a very big fan of Devil Dogs. Hey, how--how'd he know? Oh, Claire, uh, do you remember Jake Singer? I--I believe I heard you speak. -How are you? -Very well, thank you. Uh, yourself? Good. Uh, Jake seems to have lost a--a fountain pen at the fundraiser here. Oh, how quaint. I mean, who cares about a pen these days? Well, actually it was my father's. And, uh, did you find it upstairs? No, unfortunately I couldn't find it. Oh, won't your father be disappointed? Well, it's just one of many disappointments. Besides he didn't know I stole it. Why don't you stay to dinner? If you promise not to steal anything. Um, no, actually I should be going. Yeah, um, I'm gonna walk him out the door. But it was very nice to see you again. Yeah, that's good. Put it on--no, on me. -All right, here, right? -Want me to turn around? No. -Come on, give it to me. -Oh, go, go, go, go, go. It's okay, it's okay. All right. It's a break and go, where do we go? -Yes! -Oh, yes! -Who is it? -Oh, hi, it's Jake Singer. Buzzer doesn't work. I'll be right down. Hi, I'm Jake Singer, I'm Walter's teacher, I called. Actually, you know, we've met before I think. I remember. He's not here. I'm not here to harass him or anything. Maybe you didn't harass him enough. Listen, I've got his books for him here. He's out looking for a job. Is he doing okay? Ah, he won't talk much. Is his old school gonna take him back? Next year. My son did a bad thing, but he's not a bad kid. No, I know, if--if there's anything I could do to help. You tried to help Walter and that's great, and I'm really sorry about your head. But sometimes you just have to let it go. It's not your business anymore. -Take care. -Okay. -Hello. -Is this Jacob Singer? -Who's this? -I'm calling from North Ridge Hospital. Are you the son of Dr. Arnold Singer? Yeah, why. Seatbelt. Dad? Dad, it's Jake. Can you hear me? Jacob. Why you here? You went into shock, Dad, but they say you're gonna be okay. Routine. Why didn't you let them test the dye? They're supposed to test the dye for allergies, Dad. You could've died. Okay, you rest, Dad. I'll be here. -You all right? -Yeah. Do you want me to come in with you? It's a small room. I'm all right now, Jake, you don't-- You don't need to miss more work. Ah, I'll stay through the weekend. What about this woman you're seeing? She'll understand? Mhm. What'd her husband die of? Coronary thrombosis. Well, it's mercifully quick at least. Sometimes. At least it's-- It's not thought to be genetic. Actually, both her kids are adopted. Have you considered this factor? -The point is that you-- -The point is, Dad, you would prefer biological grandkids. Yes, I would, I would. -Something of your mother. -Well, I would, too, and maybe that's still possible. But for now, I am something of my mother. I'm not exactly fit to entertain. She's not gonna be in your way, Dad. ...those kids running around here, that's one thing. -You want some creamed spinach? -I hate creamed spinach. I told you to get some broccoli or something. -This is all they had, Dad. -This will kill ya. Listen, um, I may propose to Allegra, and if I do, I'd like to use Mom's ring. You gave it to-- What's her name? -Julia. -Yeah. -Mhm. -Lovely girl. She gave it back. I know. Um, that was a mistake and I wasn't ready, but I am now, Dad, and even if Allegra doesn't accept it-- Yeah, well, why don't you find out first? It might save me the trouble. All right, I'll look for it, I'll look for it. Thank you. I've gotta look for it. Thanks. Dad. This is Allegra, Alex, and Emily. Hi, so sorry to barge in on you like this. Oh, no, no, no, please, please, come in. -Alex? -Yep. Hi. Uh, I bet Alex would love to see the model of the heart that you've got. -Ah, I know. -Here, come on. Sit over here. This here is a pump. Sends the blood all through the body. Take that thing off there with that pin. Look inside. Where's the embolism? You know what that is? Heard a doctor say it about my dad. Oh, it's kind of a hard thing for a kid to know about. Could it happen to me? No. I don't think you have to worry about it. Are you worried about it? Guess not. Good. -Can I go outside now? -Sure. I hope it was all right, showing him this. He really seemed to want to know. I think it, um-- it really helps him to hear it from someone who's experienced that kind of loss. You must be a--a good teacher. Jake must get it from somewhere. Wanted to teach him at one time myself, to be a surgeon. Wasn't meant to be. Dr. Singer, if ever an English teacher was like a surgeon in spirit, it's Jake. That's very nice of you to say. Makes absolutely no sense. Well, uh, it was worth a try, right? I guess. Tell me something. What do you want from Jake? You're very direct. Well, he's head over heels. I can see why. But you've had--well, you have pretty much a life and kids, and I was wondering. I know he would like to have a child of his own. Is that an option with you? I‚Äî‚Äî Aren't you jumping the gun a bit? Can we just give it some time and see what happens? Sure. Take care, Alex. Take care of yourself, good to meet ya. -Bye. -Bye. - I hope you feel better. -Thanks. -Bye, Dad, thanks. -Son, thank you. -Mhm. -She's really something. - I know. -Complicated business. -You know what you're doing? -Mhm. Can we talk about this later? -Sure. -If you could keep an open mind, -it would mean a lot to me, Dad. -I'll try. Right. Drive safely. Mr. Singer. What are you doing? Watering your plant. I see. Mr. Singer, where were you this morning? -What do you mean? -They called your name in assembly for that London thing next semester. -Really? -Yeah, it was funny. Proctor looked around and when you weren't there he said you were off devising the hardest qualifying test ever. Oh, my God, Proctor tried to make a joke, about me? Yeah, I guess so, why? Uh, it could be the end of the world as we know it. Whatever, see you later, Mr. Singer. Bye, guys. Claire's away, temp maid today. Could you bring Alex home? Yes. Good news. How about dinner? Okay. Need to go downtown to the adoption agency at four. Should be back by six. Mom said your mom died when you were my age. Yeah, she did. Did you miss her a lot? I still do. At least you have your dad. He let me pick up one of those knives doctors use, what do you call them? Uh, scalpels. Yeah, that's right: scalpels. Your dad was cool. Well, I'm glad you like him. Did you have any fights with him? Uh, yeah, we, uh, we had some big arguments. Are you gonna marry my mom? Why? Do you want me to? I don't know. It would be kinda weird. Can I think about it? Hi. Good afternoon. Mrs. Callucci is waiting for you and Mrs. Marshall in the living room. Mrs. Callucci? Um, uh...okay. Listen, can you do me a favor and just put on some coffee? Oh, sure. Here, hold the baby. Okay. Good girl, good girl. Uh, hey, it's me. Look, Ms. Callucci is here, so could you just call me when you pick up this message? -Hi. -Ms. Callucci? At last. You must be-- I thought you were going to meet with Allegra at your office. No, we had always scheduled a 4:00 home visit for today. -She didn't tell you? -Oh no, she did, but there just must have been a mix-up. Ah, well, if she doesn't come soon, we can call my office. In the meantime, do you mind if we get started, Mr. Marshall? Yeah, she seems tired. Well, it's nice to see you bonding with her, especially since you've been away so much. You know, well, actually-- Yes, you were very difficult to pin down. Now we have to visit both of you, in this case, because of the birth mother's imperative: She was alone and is very clear about wanting her daughter raised in a two-parent household. No, I do understand that. How has having Emily affected your relationship with Allegra? Um, well, she's happy being a mother, and that in turn makes me happy. Is it different, having a girl? I don't think so. Alex is going to get older, and then he and I will do things, and Emily and Allegra can do things. Wait, so you're adopting a child to balance your books, so to speak? No, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that way. Um, I guess being around the kids, I've been able to discover, I guess, deeper feelings for Allegra. It's sort of like seeing somebody in a new light, um, almost like discovering a new person. Well, that's so nice. Uh, this form is a formality. Uh, okay, but I usually just let the lawyers look at it. Hi. I am so sorry about the mix-up. I didn't realize it was a home visit. My secretary must have gotten it wrong. Well, your husband and I have had a lovely chat. Really? It's so helpful having two such active parents to take up the slack. George was just telling me how all of this has changed your relationship for the better. Right, um... Would you excuse us for a second? I just need to grab a glass of water. Oh, certainly. We'll be right back, Miss Callucci. Sure. You told her you were my husband? No, I did not. The new maid did. She just started asking questions, so I played along. I thought it was the right thing to do. What were you thinking? I didn't think, I just reacted. And I thought it would help. What do I tell her now? Mr. Singer! A lie is a failure to understand oneself. These are precisely the ways in which we derail our lives. I didn't purposely plan on it. No one ever does, Mr. Singer. Nevertheless, when you start to drive ass-backward through life, it can be very hard to stop. And you realize too late the major decisions of your life are lying in the road like so many crushed squirrels. I guess we have to tell her the truth. Yeah, I guess. No, I thought his name was George. No--well, yeah, it, um, yes, it was George. This is my friend Jake Singer. My husband George died ten months ago, and I've just gotten back on my feet. I'm so sorry. I should have told you this sooner. I see. Well, this is most unusual. I went to your office today to clarify this, I'm sure you can imagine how difficult it's been. You see, Emily is meant to be my daughter. We've gotten so close and I love her so much. But you do know about the two-parent stipulation, of course? Of course I do, but that's just it. I mean, there must be some way around it. Well, why don't we put this aside for the moment. Yes, let's reschedule and I can do the data collection later. Miss Callucci, I would just like to apologize. You better get your stories straight. Now this is not a game. I'll be in touch very soon. Thank you. Goodbye, Mr. Marshall. It gives me no satisfaction, you know, that this ill-advised emotional involvement shall only have brought everyone more pain. But I still think that, given half a chance, she and I could be good together, we could move forward. You're not even facing forward. That is not fair. Life is unfair, Mr. Singer, but that is a ballad you should restrict to the shower. You had a good chance to make a clean break. What did you do? You involved yourself further. But I don't want to make a clean break. You disregarded my advice. I have followed a lot of your advice, but when I don't you act like it's a betrayal. You're worse than my father. And I am not your son. I am not the cause of your unhappiness. My father said the same thing, and I know it, but maybe it's us who should make a clean break. I've tried my best. And you have given me a lot. But for now... ...it's enough. Maybe another time. There are no maybes, Mr. Singer. You walk out that door, our work is over. You understand what I'm telling you? I was going to mail it, but it was too much trouble. I thought somebody had died. Who's left? Thank you, Dad. I appreciate it. What's the matter? Oh, it's a long story but in short, I found myself pretending to be Allegra's dead husband, to help with the adoption. -Uh-huh, and...? -I don't know. I think I made a mistake in the heat of the moment, and it might be too late. She's upset? Yes. Well, what does your therapist advise? You're my only doctor now, Dad, so advise away. I don't know, Jake. You've got to trust your instincts. Yeah, the last time I did that, Dad, I got my head cracked open and then I lost my girlfriend. So what more have you got to lose? My pride, my dignity. Ephemera, Jake... Illusions. Oh, hey, hey, did I tell you? No. I got the London semester. That's great. So, maybe next year you could come and visit? That would be grand, I'd like that. Don't give up. Thanks, Dad. I've got to go. Mrs. Callucci. I just want a moment of your time. You already had that. I would like to marry Allegra. I'd like to try being a father to Emily. I realized that while I was speaking to you. Let me ask you something. Did you start seeing her before or after her husband died? No, after, after. I just met her after. So you barely know her, is that it? No, I think I know her very well. Starting a family, Mr. Singer, requires thinking beyond the heat of the moment. Now, I am obligated to tell the adoption agency what caused the holdup in state approval. After that, it's their decision. I can't interfere. Can't or won't? I don't like being lied to, Mr. Singer. Please excuse me. Now what? At least let me know what you think of the ring? My father gave this to my mother, and I hope to give it to Allegra. Good luck to you. Now please go. Give her another chance. She deserves it and so does Emily. And to be frank, Ms. Callucci, so do I. It's Jake. I'm sorry. She doesn't want to. I know this is hard. I know you meant well. Don't tell her I told you this, but she's having lunch around the corner tomorrow at one. Jake? Julia, hey. - I know, right. -Congratulations. Thank you. Are you okay? Yeah, no, I'm fine. I hear you're dating an older woman. Oh, you know, not all widows are older. But how's married life anyway? Well, it's good. It's not easy, but it's good. Listen, Julia, did we ever stand a chance, you and me? Sure. Of course. No, seriously. If I had gotten my act together, would you have taken me on? Yeah, more than you realize. What is wrong? Nothing, um, I just have to go. Listen, congratulations. Thank you. -Bye. -Bye. -I'll see you soon, Bye -Bye. Allegra. Jake, what are you doing here? Claire told me you'd be here. Listen. I did a stupid thing, and I'm sorry. But I love you but I don't want to lose you over it. I want to be with you. I want to try to be a father to Alex and Emily. And I know that you're scared, but just think about this for a second. The birth mother's stipulation is a two-parent family. So even if it didn't work, you'd still have Emily. That's not what it's about, Jake. My husband died less than a year ago. I'm--I'm just not ready to have another one yet. I'm sorry. I should go. Hey, come on. We need you. Come play. Are you pulling them out at the same time? No, that's too many. Hi, Ms. Callucci. Thank you for coming back in. Thank you. Jacob, I have here the rough draft of the London itinerary. I'm sure you'll have some ideas of your own, but I thought we'd better start planning. We've had a record number of students apply. The Freud Museum, huh? Oh, yes, yes, the Freud Museum. That's a must. That's a must. Come. Okay, I know that this is the last day of class, but please let us try to concentrate. This is a particularly good day to discuss The Stranger, since many of you are about to face the existential dilemma of the summer: internship in your father's corporation or beach with friends. Phil, how did you manage with The Stranger? Uh, okay, I guess. I mean, it's really frustrating. I was waiting for this huge, profound moral and nothing-- it just didn't happen. Chris, what do you think Camus is trying to say? Maybe that like modern man's like in serious trouble if he doesn't feel any allegiances to anything? Scott, what kind of trouble? I mean, the guy just drifts, everything is a hassle for him: family, religion, civil law. Okay, so, the difficult process of self-definition can be avoided and you can just glide through the world. But that would be everyone's loss? Yeah, but I still don't know why he had to shoot that guy. I mean, he could have just shot in the air and scared them off. What would your father say? I don't think he's read Camus. What do you think he'd say? Wrong place, wrong time. But he's still responsible for what he did. So, much of what makes us who we are is up to chance. There are many forces out there that are beyond our control. But you can't stand apart. You have to embrace. The difficult job of life is building a structure for yourself, out of the remnants of your past but also having the faith that your talents will provide for your future. Hey, that's exactly what I wrote on my paper. Did you copy me, Mr. Singer? Okay. Have a good summer. Mr. Singer, have fun in London, baby! Hey, Mr. Singer, have a jolly good time eating bangers and mash in London! Thank you very much. Have a good summer, you guys. Cheerio, Singer. Hi. Hi. Did you get my messages? Yeah. You didn't call back. Look, I wanted to tell you something. I have to go. No, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. It's okay. I was wrong to blame you. It wasn't fair. It's fine. Look, I know you're upset with me, but I just want to thank you. Whatever you did or whatever you told Callucci made a difference. Emily can stay with me. Good, I'm glad. I'm glad it worked out. Jake. I've missed you. I've missed you too. I don't understand. Have you met someone else? No, but I've held on to someone else for too long, and it almost killed me. But it didn't, it didn't kill you, did it? No. That's what love is, Jake. It isn't your sanguine sunrise or your deep embattled clouds. It's seeing your husband die and being able to stand up again, or getting your heart broken and being brave enough to try again. Can you please take me home, please? Give me a second, huh? I'll be right back, okay? Are you really going to follow through with this mistake? Give me that back and get out. You're giving me an ultimatum? You haven't a clue what you're doing. I am asking you to please go. And I am saying that your unconscious is pleading for me to stay. I labored to unlock your psyche, and you fled at the first sign of improvement. Oh, you admit it. I'm improved. But you have so much more. That I could only get from you. I'm the last great Freudian, Mr. Singer. The last in a line stretching from Moses to Aristotle to Cicero to Milton. Moral visionaries. You think you have found your answer in this woman, but you are still looking for the mother you have lost. I know that I am better in a relationship than alone. Better in love. There is so much more that you could be but will never come near if you take this easy road. Admit it, at least to yourself. I--I don't think this is gonna be easy, to be a father to her children? But... I'm willing to take a shot, Doc. And I'm getting married. And you're not invited. So, scram. -This is your last chance! -Get in the closet. Don't be a fool! Jake? Hey. What's in the closet? Just junk, old junk. Too much. Too much. Are you okay? You look like you've seen a ghost? Um, I don't believe in ghosts.
