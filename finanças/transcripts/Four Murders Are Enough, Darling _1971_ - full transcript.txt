Four Murders Are Enough, Honey AKA A Corpse in Every Wardrobe Here we are at last! Please make sure you have the check. Please button yourself up. Please sit by the window and I'll stay near the door. Or maybe no... No... Please stay here and I'll sit there. You are here to care about my safety... ...not to play on my nerves Easy, I know my job. Are you going to sleep? I have an headache. Here. Have a look at this. We must hurry, ...so the other gang won't get the check ahead of us. No worries, Boss! I'll take care of them! We started first and so we will finish, Boss How it is? You're on duty here? - But I'm on duty here! - No I'm on duty! but I have work shifts here until the 13-th of the month. It's clearly written here! Tickets please! The Check! Tough Luck! The check will be ours! Out, damned spot! Out, I say! One! Two! Why, then, 'tis time to do it. Who will tell us... Why Lady Macbeth says that? Maybe... Maybe You, Jerry! Well, so... Why Lady Macbeth is saying in her dream: "Out, damned spot, out I say!" Maybe she thought that she has a stain on her dress... ...and she have to carry it to laundry. No, wrong, sit down! In those times laundries were not so common. So what's the matter with this stain, Goodman? It had to be a grease stain. Otherwise she won't care so much. Of course not! It's about a bloody stain! Bloodstain! It's him! The thief! Did You steal a parcel of "Devilish Panther" from Mrs. Clark's shop? - Yes. - Answer in full sentence, Goodman! Yes, Mr. Director. How could You do a such thing! It was very simple. I waited till Mrs. Clark was alone... That?s how Black Fred usually works. Then I throw a bag over her head, just like Big Lander. and then I took the parcel, and locked her up, so she couldn't pursue after me. Just like Barry Brand did in "Sinister Partridge". What does it mean? Silence! You did well, Goodman. Exactly for a unsatisfactory note from behavior! Agreed Mr. director, I always play fair. Why steal something like that, Goodman?! Why didn't you steal a Shakespeare or Petrarch? What have you done with this stuff? I burned it, such things are dangerous, you know. I stole them, so no one can read them. Well, he's a good boy. Believe me. He had good intensions. You're making a laughing stock of yourself. A porter's wife enjoys more respect than you! You think so? Well... kitty? So you were playing basketball yesterday? I only thought that... Next time don't think at all! From now I will do what I want! I'll date the first man who walks through the door. Ok I'll try but I don't know... I hope that you understand me. - Boss... - Georgie, your stories are beautiful... ...but when I read them... ...I fall asleep. Literally! And I want to cry. And when I see those cartoons of yours, I'd like to... ...beat the shit of somebody! There's nothing to laugh at it, Sabrina. Come with me to my office. Why? Because the pot is calling the kettle black. Georgie! What are you doing this evening? I'd like to practice the tuba. It can wait. What would you say if we spent this evening... together? We could listen to some music... ...drink... ...and so on. That's not fair. You said that you'd date the first man, not the last loser. Losing your temper? So, 8 o'clock, okay? Okay! Is that you, Mrs. Harrington? Was I annoying you? Not as far I'm concerned, Mr. Camel! But Mr. Huse broke his lease because of you. Damn! First the Bedfords, and now Mr. Huse! Do you want to ruin me? No, it's impossible! Certainly! Ruin me! Do you have yeast, peppermint and formic acid? Excuse me? I'd like to prepare a "hoo-hoo" cocktail. I found the recipe in the newspaper. But what for? My friend's coming to visit. and I care about making a right impression. Is this friend... a lady? Charlie, a lady?! I won't allow women here! Yes I know! Back to the cocktail... So what is needed? Some rum, a bit of egg yolk... ...yeast, peppermint... ...cayenne pepper,... and formic acid. Oh my God! Sir! What are you doing? Please stand up! I'm expecting a special guest! You can't lie just like that! Jesus Maria! Mrs. Harrington! I can't now! Excuse me! May I? No! I have ingredients for the cocktail! Are you there? Mr. Camel! Please come in, Mrs. Harrington! You went to bed, Mr. Camel? It's nothing! It's just insignificant jungle fever. It will pass soon! Jungle fever? I didn't know that you have jungle fever. And where is Mr. Charlie? Who? Oh, yes, that... He's in the bathroom. Washing his legs. Legs? Mr. Camel, I know where this gentleman is and you should be ashamed of yourself! I must leave now! I don't feel good here. You can't imagine how glad I am that you're here! You look a bit frightened. Is something wrong? No, no! You see, I'm a bit absent-minded. It's from the delight of seeing you. Please sit down! What do we have to drink? A hoo-hoo cocktail. Oh, you took the recipe from our paper? Don't you have anything else? Whisky. That's better. So why don't you bring it! Whisky? What an order you have here! If you like, I can sort out your books. How can you treat them like that?! Sabrina, no! These books are to be thrown out. As a matter of fact I don't know for what you count on? And for what I could count on? Exactly. For what YOU can count on. Your hands are shaking. I suspect you've never had a woman here before. Confess! Mrs. Harrington doesn't allow it. It's terrible Georgie! It's discreditable. You think so? You are an awful loser. No wonder that woman don't want you. You need something for your column? Sure, I can use anything! And if I tell you, that you are in the same room... ...with someone not so alive. You don't need to tell me that. I can see it myself. How? Forgive me, but you often act like somebody dead. - You gave me whisky without ice. - Sorry! To our happiness, Sabrina! What has to be, will be! And what has to be? That I don't know, but I can foretell you. I'm a bit psychic about such things. - Are you cold? - No! I mean... It's because of the ice Cool, isn't it? - Does it tickle? - Yes! But according to your life line... ...You should died a long time ago! Poor chap. Probably you'll die soon. Can I get a kiss before that, Sabrina? Just one! It may be... your last. Take your hands of me or I'll scream! Calm down! What the hell was that? Some break of voltage power perhaps I'm leaving for home. Where is the phone? In the hall. You want to call the police or the power station? The police? I'll call Henry! You want to complain to him? Is this you Henry? I?m at George's. We're having great fun here. Georgie, tell Henry what we just did. Tell him that we were kissing. We were kissing. So bye! With God, Georgie! But Sabrina... You really think, that something might happen between us? I would feel with you like a one on a ten dollar note. How? Always having a zero around. But you told Henry that you had a great time... And how! Dr James Porter. I'm asking you! Why did you come here? I have luck! So, from the beginning! Have you ever heard of a corpse who walks to the door... ...to ring the bell? Yes or no? No. But it means that Dr. Porter came here alive... ...and now he is... how is he? Dead. - Did Mrs. Harrington kill him? - No. - So maybe Sabrina? - Also no. - So you killed him! - Not me either! Sit down, Georgie! We have to get breakfast together Let?s assume, that Dr. Porter was poisoned by the hoo-hoo cocktail. And so...? From the beginning! Did he prepare this cocktail? Of course. He wanted all the ingredients. But why did I kill him? Because he spoiled your evening. He was shouting at him, "You spoiled my whole evening!" I heardc that also! So you see yourself! But I didn't kill him! He was already dead... ...when he came here. Think about it Georgie. You won't avoid the electric chair. So stop playing games with us. Be a nice guy! From the beginning! Is it normal, that a corpse walks to the door to ring the bell? Yes or no? No. What it is? Listen Georgie, do you know a certain Jose Manuel Antonio from San Bonica? And Mr. Francis Owes from Michiga? Also don't. Interesting. They both bailed you out, paying $10,000 each. According to the Bonzanni laws, you are free. Go home. This murder will boost your career. People are reading your column. Ah this Georgie, can anybody understand that? Maybe he did it so you'll have something to write about... ...because he loves you so much? Maybe. Boss, where is the man who wanted to place an announcement? I don't know, he probably left. Damn! Georgie, you're here? I was bailed out. Anyway you will get to the gallows! to the chair. An electric chair, to tell the truth. You have nerves of steel, old chap. What have you got there? "A shadow of death fell on my love, cold prison bars cooled my head. " Good Lord, it will be a hit! You wrote it for me, is it true? I would never have thought that you were capable of it. Are you content that I did it? Content? I wouldn't say that. I'd rather say that you are a real man. So you did it that I can write about that? Of course, Sabrina. It was nothing! I can even do such things more often! How you did it? Oh it's so simple. First I did BING! And then BANG! and it was... BONG! I love him! He's a real man, isn't he?! This love... ...won't last long. I know. He has it written on his palm. Freddie! They accused me for a murder! I read about it in the paper. Give me that back! I'm on parole. They want to hang me! I need your advice But you will give me it back? Please, does anybody from Michiga or San Bonica lives here? Michiga... Dr. Porter. Yes, he's the one I killed. So what's the matter? Freddie, you are an expert on crime novels and all that pulp. How dare you! All right, it's an excellent literature... But you must help me to find the real murderer. Ah, yes! How could it all be arranged? It could happen like this... As far as I know, this Porter was travelling from New Yortec to San Fernando. So, why did he stop here? He must notice, that some party is following him... Maybe, it was even two parties. When he came here, he asked for some pills. He had a headache. And later he was in cafe with some blonde He didn't need the pills anymore but she gave him some Later he left without the woman. Maybe he get suspicious and wanted to be rid of her. Then he went some other place and someone poisoned him with hoo-hoo cocktail He probably wanted to wash down that pill. When he started to feel pains, he went for help. Accidentally he found your door but it was too late. You're a genius! Listen, where do they produce hoo-hoo? It's easy to check. I'll send you a man who is an expert on it. His name is... Gogo. You escaped? Don?t be scared. I'm here perfectly legally. You framed me! Very nice of you! It's because of my playing on tuba, am I right? But no no! I don't care about the tuba! I hid this! A lot of strange people were snooping around here earlier. But please imagine my luck! I have new tenants! In Mr. Bedford's place - three guys from San Bonica, ...and in Mr. Huse's - three guys from Michiga. There is even a pastor among them! Can you introduce us, Madame? With pleasure! This is Mr. Camel, Mr. Jose Manuel Antonio, from San Bonica. Thank you very much indeed! May we talk for a moment? Ten thousand dollars is no small amount. I'd like to repay you. A wallet! What wallet? Dr. Porter's wallet. Yes... Did you take anything from it? No, nothing. Thank you. Excuse me, more of my new tenants would like to meet you! Mr. Francis Owens from Michiga. How are you? Good morning! I'm Francis Owens. The bail from you... it was very polite I'd like to get something in exchange for it. Maybe a wallet? I already got it. Well, so... Mr. Camel... ...can you please... ...leave us alone. With pleasure, gentleman! I'm Gogo. Hello! We can go. I'm here to show you around some bars. Ah yes! Freddie sent you? Pardon gentlemen! Excuse me, but I have guests. It looks like... ...they can manage without you. Let's go! "What was it yesterday," "Elderberry blossoms only once. " "Bed springs groan. " "And jazz beats around. " "What was it yesterday," "And today a new one is," "Waiter has a sad face," "Like a homeless dog. " "Teeth shine, hands burns," "Sex is in the air," "No matter from where you are" "Drink toasts for your ex " "What was it yesterday" "We'll sleep till tomorrow," "Bed springs groan" "When they give you ought to take" If all goes well, we'll tank up a lot. What is this place called? Bar... ...Kochba. Holy Jesus and Mary! We are only at "K"?! And they have it? Have they? Two hoo-hoo cocktails! We don't have it. Two whiskeys then. Maybe for you. But I want that cocktail... hoo-hoo! We don't have hoo hoo cocktails, sir. Then it's no respectable place! What did you say? This is no respectable place for me! Be careful. I don't like such manners. You would like to get a hoo-hoo cocktail? And you know where I can get it? Of course I know. I would be very grateful, Madame. No problem for me. We'll come to it. "With the FELIX alarm clock, you'll welcome every day with joy!" Come here, my squirrel! Please don't touch me! And in the night, you wanted to eat me whole! Dear miss... Can you arrange, that no one will see me here?. But why? Yesterday at the bar you were kissing with everybody. How much do I owe you? $60. That's quite a bit. Honey, you torn up my clothes, underwear, bit through a bracelet... just look! I think, that you're a little strange! Good bye! By honey! Come back any time! Excuse me... What? Still here? Excuse me, but whose hat is this? It belongs to a gentleman from Michiga. He was here day before yesterday. Did you treat him with hoo-hoo cocktail? Yes, but he fell asleep and went away. What's the matter with you? So you are the murderess? What are you talking about, you bastard? So you are the murderess? Leave me alone, you bump! Help! A madman! Next time don't try to offend me! Police! A deviant! He attacked me! He's a madman! You shouldn't, Georgie! you were bailed out, what are you doing? She's a murderess, she poisons people with hoo-hoo cocktails! Yesterday you wanted to drink it! Exactly! He alone drank half a liter! I was poisoned! As I told you! Don't stimulate your stomach and don't leave home. First advice is from a doctor, the second from a policeman. So much the worse, Mr. Camel! You murder people, wander through the night... ...and worst of all, you bring women here! I told you that I'm not here for a social visit... ...but to do an interview. Interview? What's the matter with you? I feel... sick. Can I help you, reverend father? Praise the lord My son, and lord will help you. You have guilty conscience. I thought that maybe you want to confide? Me? But why? Didn't you steal something from a certain wallet? Confess, and you will feel better. A reverend father wants the best for you, Georgie. If you stole something, confess and you'll feel better. But I didn't steal anything. Ok. As you wish. Reverend father, please at least bless him. So, you didn't steal? Georgie! It was a woman! Are you joking?! They come here in disguise, so Mrs. Harrington... You think so? Perhaps because, they write about me so much. Kiss me! Don't look! Do you like me like this? Or this? Do you hear that music? Come to me honey! Forgive me, but I'm not in good shape. But I... Last night... ...I was thinking about us, very long... Take shower. Yes, in a moment. "SPRINGTOWN" spring will strengthen your life-force! Have you ever heard about a corpse, who comes to take a shower? - No never. - Exactly! Please gentlemen understand that... From the beginning! Sabrina, please tell exactly what you saw, and only this! I saw George wielding a knife, leaning over the man... ...lying on the ground. With a hole in his back. Why is he doing this? Tell me why?! If you'd like to know, he's doing it for me. ...so I have something to write about. Don't listen to her! I know why he is doing this! First he drove away my tenants playing on his tuba... ...and now he starts to murder them! No! He's doing it to help me! No! He's doing it to destroy me! Mr. Camel! We came here to save you. Where is the check? I don't know. Where did you hide it? I don't know anything! He's no go do us dead! Ok... Let?s take a break. You took a check for a million dollars from Dr. Porter's wallet. And you think that you can keep it to yourself? Is this so? No. We will give you two hours to think it over. Then we will be back here... ...and will kill you. Where did you get those knives? I have an knife storehouse in Michiga. See you in two hours! I didn't want to wake you up. Where have you put that check? Nowhere. That means... ...that you have it here. I'm very pleased to hear that. But I don't have any check, and I have to go out now. Where to? To jail... good bye! There's no need to hurry. You dropped a bullet. If you move from here... It will be your end! So you don't know where the check is? That's good. See you! Bye. You escaped from prison! Is that so, Mr. Camel? You murder even the dead! You should be ashamed! I will call the police! Yes. Please call them. Police? Inspector Brooks? I'd like to tell you, that Mr. Camel... Yes exactly... Yes, thank you! They'll be here in half a minute, better prepare yourself! Thank you, you are very kind. By any chance, did you take anything... ...from the wallet that you returned to me? How dare you?! Poor fellow! If you know, how our civilization goes downhill because of people like him... Here comes the arm of justice! Open the door! And I tell you that.. How can you do it to me! On everybody?s eyes! Good morning! This is Mr. Sheridan from headquarters. He came here because the scale of your crimes... ...exceeded the borders of our district. I'm very pleased to hear that... Do you know any facts, that can explain the motives of our criminal? Mr. Camel systematically murders my tenants. Did they cause any trouble to you? Play loud, make noise for example? It was he who played the tuba! And they come here trying to prohibit it? No, no, they came here already dead, before I even start to play. And can you tell me, how it is arranged? It's very simple! As soon as I open the door a corpse falls out. So you claim, that you only open the door and the corpses fall out... And how were you clothed when the first corpse appeared? In a blazer. Please put it on. Why? Deconstruction of the events must be very accurate And please don't interrupt me, or I'll throw away this job and go home! I'm on my last nerve! Excuse me, on that day I was wearing a white underpants, should I wear them now also? Of course. Excuse me. I keep the blazer here. Unbelievable! Just as I told you. Anytime I open the door... Pow! Unbelievable! It's a tenant? Yes. Please continue. All right, I keep underwear here. My god, another one! Tenants. A corn? Miniver. Heavy melancholy, he drank himself with compote! Peritonitis? - Ham. - Ham. Colic in childhood... ...later sexually exploited by a nun, by the forest spring. A female? A pie. Do you prefer to commit murders in the evening, or rather on empty stomach? I don't murder at all. And you don't like blood? Goose blood for example? Not quite. Thank you, it's enough. Attention! Thank you. So what? This man doesn't commit murders alone. There is at least... ... seventeen of them. That's too much! And he constantly talks about some check. Is this a serious symptom? It's obvious. For a "corn" he replied with "Miniver". It can signify... ... mumps... ...or... a check. He doesn't have mumps. Thank you, sir! Good bye! There are more of them. Sit down and write. Telegram to New Yortec. Send the reinforcements, stop. Act discretely and cautious, stop. Come in! In the last victim's pocket there was a telegram... ...Are you interested? Everything interests me! Send the reinforcements, stop. Act discretely and cautious, stop. Blow! What can be there! "When the white birches sang... " I bet it was Mrs. Harrington who maliciously hide them! Nothing! Why do you insist that you have a check, when it's nothing here? Because the tenants keep saying so. And they beat me because of it. What would you like to suggest? Everybody, who supposedly beat you, stand now before our Lord's court. From your warrant! Let?s go, we are wasting time. Please check over there. Gentleman, if that check won't be there... A corpse. Yes, what else did you expect? Every time I open the door, a corpse appears. Does this suffice you, or is it not enough yet? Still hot. Search him! Damned! I'll solve it! He has a telegram in his pocket, are you interested? Of course! Send the reinforcements, stop. Act cautiously and discretely, stop. I can't stand it! I can?t stand it, what the hell is going on there! - His ancestors were... - Italians. Yes, Italian! So you say, that every time you open the door... Please open. Now! Please open them! Mr. Fernandez! My next to last tenant. He will murder them all! She's alive. Only that poor pastor upstairs left. Please don't be scared. Our reinforcements will come here soon. Call the guards to take the body away. What a shame! Everybody thinks, that we got murderer. And meanwhile he's playing with us. The corpses fall like rain. He is innocent. Let him go. I said, "Let him go"! There's no way. This is his place. So take him away... and he'll escape us, is that clear? That's no avail to you. He will remain a murderer in people?s eyes. He will be our bait. And the true murderer will do... do what? He will become careless! Let?s go! Yes, sir! Let's go! He needs to be prosecuted fast. He's no man he's a beast! As far as he won't escape us. And he will escape. Idiot! Good Bye! Here's your towel! So the reverend will leave us too? I don't feel safe here. Police! We'd like to search Mr. Camel's room. Police were already here, and they found nothing. Better for us, we must find it! Where were they? There. How can my nerves stand all of this?! Don't exaggerate! - Kate is here. - Stop! Here we are, Kate! Let?s move from here. The bunch from San Bonica is here. So we take care of them! It's not necessary, I've got the check! So let's move back to Michiga. Not so fast. Police reinforcements are on the way. Looks like whole town is already blocked. We must wait through. Get in! Freddie, haven?t you seen a group of people here? We are waiting for detectives from headquarters. So far no. When they'll arrive, be kind to them, so they won't complain. You have a visitor. Can I help you, reverend? A room please. When will the father leave? In the morning, after the sermon. It's them, from headquarters. Rooms? You don't need to fill in the papers, we know who you are. Quiet! - We will make a shootout. - But only after I sneeze. We are waiting for you. Inspector Brooks! You prepared a good trap for us. But we will get out. I don't doubt it! Try not to bring attention. A music band! Great idea! This Camel is innocent. It looks like it's a gangster's job. Never fear, we will help you. We are not as stupid as you think about us at headquarters. Of course! What now? Wait till he sneezes! Just as he said. What a draught! Better not to sneeze... Shady people meet in "Bar Kochba". You'll go inside. I'll arrange it with the owner. Let?s go, it's dangerous here. We'll take your instruments. Where? Where? To "Kochba" bar of course. No! Leave it! He thinks that we are detectives from headquarters. We're in luck! We have to play this comedy to the end. You don't need to play to the end. They close at midnight! You can get to your work. Do we have to return our weapons? What weapons? You can't go unarmed. What a fool I am! You are not on vacation! Exactly! All right, we deliver weapons to the bar. Let them have them. On my responsibility. Thank you! I'd like to add that I will be with you! All evening. Our singer. Ah, a singer! Well well! You prepared yourself marvelously! See you this evening! What a mess! I never played anything. It's not a safe game. Where to hide the check? Maybe give it to the bank? Idiot! Briefs "APOLLO"! Briefs for a cosmic age man! They are stretchy, tight fitting, but not constrictive. A model free of charge. If you try them on you can get three pairs for the price of one! Interesting offer. Please try them on. In my opinion he is "The Leopard from Springtown". People call him "The Beast from Springtown". No! Yes it's him! and he escaped again! I called the police, but it looks that they don't care. Oh, really! Oh... and where is Mr. Camel? I feel excellent, just wonderful. Please treat me like a regular customer. I'll take further cooperation with joy. See you! - Sabrina! - What does it mean? What was that cooperation? Georgie, confess! It's not about feeling, but about... business. How can you be so cynical? They are guilty of depraving you. Every time I come here, my path crosses with another woman - Is that my fault? - No, please, please! - Do you know why I came? - No. I'd like to write about you, you know? About your childhood. I need a photograph. Here you are! - But you must return it! - Of course. Wait Sabrina. What are you doing this evening? Maybe we could go somewhere? Are you joking? They'll arrest you immediately! So what? Georgie, aren't you afraid? "The Leopard from Springtown" scared? C'mon! Do with me, what you please! You'll forget about all the others you see. At last, a moment of peace and joy! At last! My bottle with polish paste broke... ...yes gentleman, a tough task awaits you. Do you have a place to stay? The hotel is full up. Doesn't matter, Brooks certainly has found a respectable place for you. Brooks! Brooks! Where is that man? Damn! How I can work in such conditions?! "White leg on the tablecloth struggle like in a trap," "Yesterday a wine spilled out near a locker room. " "Cold wave from the west sometimes wash a chair," "A chair jumps on a shore and shout on us in a low voice. " Damned! How could they engage such crap artists! Please don't pay attention, just follow the beat! Splendid, isn't it? You understand, New Yortec! A kind of a new wave! Yes, very original. And with interesting lyrics. - I don't know what they are up to? - They always stand in our way. Maybe we should settle scores with them? Yes, gentleman? Bottle of whisky! My God! "The Beast from Springtown"! He can't do anything here, too many people. The whole police force is looking for him, and he sits at the bar. His courage impresses me. Georgie Camel is here. Shouldn't you arrest him? Don't worry, a lot of police are here. Nothing can happen. "When somebody walks away, there is always full of misunderstandings," "Look He walks away! What will happen next?" "We will escape through the kitchen, there should be less of them there. " "When we'll finish playing. " "And if he comes back? If he comes back?" "We must play on!" Nice to see you, Mr. Camel! Would you like to order hoo-hoo, just like last time? You come here often? Not today thank you! A soup... ragu-royal, - ... with dumplings. - An excellent choice sir. Do you enjoy the music? It's terrible. They deserve to be shot. It won't happen again! I'm so sorry! He is afraid of you, you see? You are smoking? I try to. It's ready. Yes, gentleman? From the audience for the artists. A present from our guests. You see! We don't play that badly. What's the matter? I'll be back in a moment. What is happening to you? Enough, it was third! Greetings. My regards Madame! Oh! Mr. Gogo! Please come to my place, at 3PM. My respect! He is afraid of you, too. He recognized "The Leopard from Springtown" and is scared. Excuse me, be back in a minute. Maybe a cigarette? Ladies and gentleman! A serial murderer, Mr. Camel, just killed three members of the band. He wasn't pleased with their performance. It was doing of San Bonica bunch. We foolishly lost a three men. Let's finish. For the fear of God, Georgie! You should stop this! You're right, I don't feel good about it. Please promise me, that it was last time. I promise, Sabrina. I promise. You can slap people, but not kill. I can't keep pace with writing about it. There's not enough space in my column. Enough of this murders, honey. If you don't need your eyes, my friend can buy them back. Do you remember what you promised me? Slap him in the face, but don't kill him. Maybe he has a wife and children! As you wish, Sabrina. You! Just you wait! I'll give you a beating! Are you crazy? He can still be some use to us! Leave me! I must repay him! Tomorrow I'll take the check and we'll leave from here. Let?s move. But why? I said let?s move! Whenever you need to commit next murder... ...please visit, us we'll always find a victim for you. I ordered soup with dumplings! Looks like the cook misunderstood. Please don't trouble yourself... ...I'll shoot him personally. You'll see, what is a disciplinary proceeding! You don't recognize a criminal from a gangster! If I... Cover all exits! Immediately! Quickly! Get away! And you to Mrs. Harrington's place! You will follow Mr. Camel's every move. Is that clear?! Take a walkie talkie. You will be "Towel", and I'll be "Soap". Where there is Mr. Camel, corpses are also. You should have warned me of this fact earlier! "Don't be a coward," Lady Macbeth said to her husband... ...Strangle him or put a knife under his ribs. Just like Sammy Larry. And all will be over! Macbeth finely polished his Browning. And in the evening, when he walked in to order a beer.. ... he walked up to Duncan and said: "Hands up, you scum!" And he started to shoot at him. Shot at him like on the shooting range. Only at night, after that murder, Macbeth couldn't fall asleep. All the time, he has in front of his eyes, a picture of the dead man and pouring blood. And he promised to himself, that he won't kill again. That next time he will just hire somebody. That next time... End... for today. All right, go home. Quickly! He knows his stuff, doesn't he? Hey man! Just think about it! A teacher, pursued by police! That's a real thing! This time was better, Mr. Director? Very unorthodox approach I would say.

I swallowed it. The only possibility... an operation. We will share... ...fifty-fifty. Don't mock with him! He doesn't mock me. All right! Fifty-fifty. Is there any doctor present here, gentleman? Excuse me. I'm... a veterinary surgeon. That should work. The cow has four stomachs. He only has one. But I don't know how to sew. He cannot sew! It's all right. I'm a certified tailor from Vienna Where is the sewing machine? In the kitchen. One towel over here! One towel over here! I'll lend you mine. Take this hag away, or I'll quit this job. Don't disturb him. Please go downstairs and don't bother yourself. Calling "Soap"! Come in "Soap"! And now "Soap" again?! Gentleman! You can't wash yourself so often It's not a duty; it's a kind of cabaret! Hey boss, if you'd like to buy a guitar... Madame, we will need a hydrogen peroxide, ammonia and iodine. Are you preparing a new cocktail? And also a needle, a thimble, a hammer and a razor. And a bowl for blood. I mean, a bowl for salad. And a pen-thil! We have a pencil. But it's not a copy pen-thil! The most important is, you don't need a towel. I have one more, but where it is? A million dollars is somewhere here. It's not a stomach, but a paunch. Excuse me, but all this is called a stomach. This part is called stomach. That other is called a back. Are you thure that you pathed all examth? Yes. via a correspondence course. From what distance? Brazil to New Zealand. Looks like a big distance! I'll make the cut this way. Hold him! It's almost a meter. Who will sew it up after? Maybe like this. Looks all right! Mr. Camel! There should be one more towel in your rooms. We are extra police reinforcements. It's here! Help me, Mrs. Harrington! I think that he doesn't agree. And who would agree?! You are right, we are living in terrible times! Narcothith, or we won't thucktheed! Quickly! Looks like something is happening downstairs? Hey boss, maybe we should go there and take a look? Keep calm, boys! "Soap" over! Understood! "Towel" over! I have here one more, but it's a bit salivated on by Mr. Camel. You don't mind? I think sometimes, that a murder is not necessarily immoral. They said that murderers are just normal people. I'm Gogo! Madame, Mr. Camel invited me. Everyone says that. There are too many of you. Out of my way, Madame! "The Beast from Springtown" invited me here. All Gogos downstairs! And all towels upstairs! "Towel over"! What did I hear? All madmen here! "Soap"? "Towel"? Police!

If cigarettes then only "MORITURI"! A cigarettes for your health, without smoke and smell! Silence! Congratulation Georgie! All alone against two gangs! Fantastic! Revelation! Didn't I say: Where he is the corpses are, too! We should have realized that much earlier! It's an unparalleled event in criminal history... ...that a civilian achieved such things! Really a sensation! The only pity, that the boss of one bunch, Drexler, escaped. And where is the check? I have it! Here you are! Excuse me, gentleman! Nineteenth! Feel the pain? Take... ..."HARMOL" Two thousand dollars for your memories, all right? Okay, but I'll start from the point when you turned down my work. Gentleman! You can wash now if you please. Here!

Tenant. Katy Drexler, leader of the gang. Take her away! A wonderful achievement of genius! Today I'll propose a self- liquidation of entire police force. Since you are in Boznania, we are not longer needed Forgive me, Georgie! I never guessed, that it was a subtle plan, to eliminate those two gangs. Are you angry at me? Georgie, when I'm in love I'm jealous Do you hear the violins? Don't cry. I won't. The foam stings my eyes. Hip-hip-hurray! What's going on there kids? Calm down! Goodman! Jerry! Shut up. I'll show you! You understand anything from that? Murderer or detective who cares? What's important is that you are no ordinary man. Because you aren't? Me? Of course not! Do you hear the violins?
