Are you Jacob? I am. You were supposed to be here hours ago. I didn't know it was in the middle of nowhere. We've been going in circles trying to find this place. Is that him? Yeah. Where's my money? - Abner! - Mrs. Adeng, I'm off. - Okay, go on. - Thanks for the meal! Mrs. Adeng, I'm off to work. - I'll go ahead! - Son! Come down here! Breakfast is ready! - Yes, Mom! I'll be right there! - Okay! Okay! - Hi, Mrs. Adeng! - Hi! Happy Monday morning! Wow! This looks so good, Mrs. Adeng! Dried fish with salted eggs and tomatoes! Winner combo! I’m gonna eat with my hands! Of course! We should be full and always smiling in the morning. - Come eat, Abner! - Hey, Abner! By the way, Ica, is your store doing much better? Do you have more customers these days? It's doing better, Mrs. Adeng. More and more people are going out. They're not scared of the virus anymore. Some people don’t even wear a face mask anymore. - Huh? - Mm-hm! And though it's supposed to be the rainy season, the days are too damn hot. Most customers are just at the mall for the air conditioning. They're not really buying anything. Just window shopping. - Eat, son! - Okay, Mom. Time flies, huh? I can't believe it's August again! It's Daddy Hernan's sixth year in the UAE! Well, on my next birthday, it's just us three again! I guess you're right, Mrs. Adeng. I haven't even met Daddy Hernan. But don't worry. Pretty soon Abner will be bringing home a girlfriend. Is that true, son? Are you going to introduce a girlfriend to mom? No, Mom! Ica just loves teasing me. Don't drag me into your conversation. - I should go, Mom. I'm gonna be late. - Don't be so sensitive, son! Finish what's on your plate! I really should go now, mom. I'm going to be late. We have an exam today. Hey, hey, hey. My kiss. Here. Kiss! Kiss your auntie! Hey, Ica wants a kiss! Oh! Abner's all grown up! Be careful, son! - Yes, mom! - Be safe! He's in a hurry! Come on, let's eat, shall we? He hates being teased. - You like the food? - Yummy! - My favorite! - Have some more! - Hurry up! - Oh no, I'm late already. - Let me have a look at that. - Oh, stop it. Thanks. Hurry! Take a look at this, bro. Out of the way. Take a look! Hey, friend! I love your makeup! Can I borrow it? Did your policeman give you that? Don't be silly! I saved up for this! Why don't you ask Arnold so you can be pretty like me! The stock room boys don't earn that much. Pfft, he rarely even takes me out. Then when I invite him to watch a movie, he'd just tell me, "Let's not! Let's just watch Vivamax!" - Have you heard? - What? They say Mr. Galvez is boning someone in his office. Huh? Should we report that pervert? Apparently, he tells girls to come into his office if they need anything. Your hand stinks! What did you have for breakfast? - Dried fish! - Dried fish! Whatever! See you girls later! - Okay, see you. - See you. Bye! - Wash your hands. It stinks! - Let's have lunch together! You'd better get there before Galvez! You... You know what's in the handbook. I shouldn't have to explain it to you. No one is allowed to leave their station until breaktime. Did you leave your phones in your lockers? - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Okay. Customer is always right. Got it? - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

Calling the attention of the parent or guardian of the missing little girl, wearing a white dress and red shoes. You may head to the customer service area... Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am. I'm sorry, but-- I've been following you around the store. Your tummy was flat just now and then... when you got out of the fitting room, it's bulging. You bitch... How dare you insult a customer? What are you insinuating? That I'm a thief? Who's the manager here? Where's your manager? Please call sir Jason. Ma'am, if I were you, I wouldn't make a scene. I've caught you red-handed, ma'am. What are you saying? You're making me dizzy. If something happens to me, I swear, I'll sue you! - Sir Jason-- - Are you the manager? What do you think you're doing? What's happening, Jessica? Sir, this woman just started accusing me of bullshit. Sir, I've been following her in the store. She wasn't pregnant before but now, when she got out of the fitting room, she suddenly has a bulge. Who are you trying to fool, lady? Watch your mouth, stupid bitch. You really think I'd be interested in your cheapass clothes? Listen to me, you moron, you're just a saleslady. Get that? And I'm a customer. Idiot. I have a lot of money! Besides, you're no better than dogs running around in here! How dare you call me a thief. - Want me to slap you? - Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am, please don't be like that. Let's have some respect for our staff. It's better to talk in our office. Let's not make a scene here, okay? Okay? Let's go. Please follow me. Excuse me, ma'am? How dare you talk down on us. We are not dogs here. Us salesladies are working as hard as everyone else. We put up with scanty wages and have to pay for stolen merch by people like you! You're a thief! I'm not a thief! I already told you! - You! Call security! - Yes, sir? - I've been noticing her a while ago. - No worries sir. So that's what she's been up to. Please escort madam to the security office, okay? Please. Come along, ma'am. Please com with us. Come along now. Next time, keep your mouth shut in front of everyone, okay? Did you really have to talk about those things? We'll talk in my office later, understood? - Where should we eat? - At the usual. Or the one beside it. Let's go. I want one too. Oh, comrades! Let's thank our champion! The one who defends against the exploitation of salespeople. Let's give it up for Jessica "Ica" Fajardo! Your lunch is on me! Oh! Thanks! You're welcome! It's true though, what I said earlier, right? They keep taking advantage of us. They're so quick to pin the blame on us! Yes! Exactly! Why should it come out of our own pockets when the register is short? What can we afford with our meager salary after all the cuts? Barely anything, right? - Nothing. It's all gone. - Yeah, practically nothing. Take Inday, for example. She keeps getting charged for missing items. This couple, Melai and Arnold. They can't even afford to go on dates because movie tickets are so expensive! But… they have a Vivamax subscription! Take it to Vivamax! Take it to Vivamax! Take it to Vivamax! Take it to Vivamax! Why'd you have to talk about us? I'm gonna pinch you! Just eat! - Our break is barely over! - So what? It's fine. We won't take long. Fine. Calling the attention of all sales personnel, please proceed to your posts. Hurry up, let's go. We might get late. ...sales personnel, please proceed to your post. Bye. Bye. Calling the attention of all sales personnel, please proceed to your posts. - Here you go, sir. - It's hot here in your department store. Can't you turn up the air conditioning? Miss, can you help me fit the shoe? It hurts when I bend over. Hey, miss! Why'd you stand up? You see? You didn't even put it on properly. Miss, what-- Miss, this feels like a bigger size. Are you sure this is size 12? It looks more like a size 15. Sir, that's a size 12. You can check. Maybe you're not as big as you think you are. You think so? You think I'm not big? You bitch? Want me to shove my cock in your mouth so you know how big it is? Sir, please don't be rude. We're talking about your shoe size, not your cock. So if you're not gonna buy, kindly leave. You're just tiring me. Now wait a minute! You're rude! I'm the rude one? You've been peeking at my breasts since you got here! Hey! You stupid saleslady! I'm a customer! A customer! And the customer is always right! Ever heard of that? Don't you know that? - Sir. Sir! - Sir. Sir! Sir. Sir! I'm really sorry, sir. I'm really sorry. I will talk to our staff about this. I'm really sorry. You. You're the manager? You're the manager here? Can you fire this woman? Fire her! - We deeply apologize, sir. - She's out of line! How dare she disrespect a customer! She humiliated me! In front of everybody! I'm very sorry, sir. Melai! Melai! Please assist sir. Hi, sir. This way please. Please let me assist you, sir. Right this way, sir. Hey, manager! You should fire her! We're on it. What are you doing, Ica? Come with me to my office. We'll talk there. Mr. De Guzman to customer service. You're really a pain in the ass. You know? Why don't you get it? Didn't I tell you? Do not argue with our customers. What happens if those people file a complaint against you? Or worse, Post on social media about the kind of service-- The way we deal with our customers? Huh? Give us bad reviews? Sir, you saw what he did to me, didn't you? He threw a shoe at me. And bullshit to the customers who say I'm the one who shows no respect. They have no respect! Oh, that's right… Customers are always right! Unfair! You know what-- That's enough, okay? You know I can just call up HR right now and tell them that you want to resign. Huh? Is that what you want? Sir... Please don't, sir. You know this is my only source of income. This is my only livelihood. For the room I'm renting. I've got no family left, sir. Sir, have mercy. Don't do this to me. I'm not a hard man to please. You know I've always had a crush on you. Right? Come on.. Put it in your mouth. - I wonder if Ica's okay... - Yeah, I'm worried. There she is! How did it go? Did you get fired? I'm okay. Don't worry about me. - You sure you're okay? - Yeah, and they can't fire me! Galvez will get what's coming to him! Really, I'm fine! Don't worry anymore - Are you sure? - 100 percent. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. Look, it's sir Dave! Oh shit, he's so cute! - He looks yummy! - Come on. We're gonna get yelled at. Oh my god, he's staring at you. Thank you, sir. Dad. You called for me? You know what? I just couldn't believe this is happening so fast. I still remember when our department store first opened. This was the place to go shopping. I got so excited when people flocked to the mall. All the lights would twinkle there in Christmas time. Dave, this was every family in Camanava's favorite hangout. That's why this is so precious to me. This is where all our businesses started. The reason why the corporation grew. But this is the last time I will ever see it. And I really have to say goodbye to my office. I leave it all up to you, Dave. You're in charge now. Dad, you're just getting a checkup in the States. Everything will be alright. And while you're away, I'll take care of things here. And I trust you. I won't let you down. Sir Dave! Sorry. Good afternoon, sir. Can you assist me? What do you need, Sir Dave? I need good sets of clothes. Ah, hold on, sir. Here, Sir Dave. I think these will look good on you. Come. Sir Dave! Jason. - What a pleasant surprise! - How are you? Sir Dave's so handsome! Do you want me to assist you? It's okay. She's here. This way please, sir. Another win for Ica. I wouldn't mind assisting sir Dave! Dream on! Come on, back to work. The prize is won! Let's go! Miss? Hello, sir? Can you help me with the fitting? Huh? Get in. Maybe I should try it on. You can't go in, sir. Why not? It's the fitting room. Sir, just use a different one. It's not allowed? - Who's in there? - Sir Dave's fitting some clothes. Sir Dave's fitting in some clothes. - Sorry, sir. Let's just use the other one. - We can't let you through. Sorry about that. You like that? Calling the attention of sales personnel, Ms. Jessica Fajardo. Please proceed to the admin office. Calling the attention of sales personnel, Ms. Jessica Fajardo - Please proceed to the admin office. - Are you okay? - Please proceed to the admin office. - Yeah. So did you see his abs? - What did you say? - Did you see his abs? Someone will hear you! Yeah, he was just wearing briefs. - Tell us more! - I bet you were so nervous. - Is he big? - No. - Stop talking, somebody might hear you. - Tell me! Hi, Ica! I wish I had assisted him instead. Hi, Ica! It's Roman. Hi Melai. Hi Day. Hi, Roman! You want me to drop you off? No, it's okay. We can take the jeep. - You sure? - Looks like you're going somewhere. We are. Thanks, though! - Okay. Bye! - If you say so. Bye! Be safe! Where do you wanna go tonight? I got my salary today. I want to go home. Just give your salary to your wife. Your family needs it more. Not this again. I told you when I'm with you, you're the wife. Stop doing this shit. You're pissing me off. I don't wanna be your mistress anymore! I'm so sick of this! I set aside some money. You can have all of it. Just let me go! Why do you say it like that? Why, are you locked up? You can do everything you want, can't you? Right? I didn't even see you the whole of last week. You don't answer my texts or calls either! Huh? And you tell me there's no phone signal where you were? Why? Who do you have someone on the side? Who's sharing your bed these days? - Tell me! - Ow! Stop that! That hurts! - Screw you! - Let go-- You bitch! If it weren't for me, you'd be living in the streets! Did you forget? That I took you in when your father went to jail! Damn you! Remember, we've got your father. What was our agreement? That I will tell you where you can find your father, once you've paid off all your debts. That's my only condition. But until you pay me, you will do everything I tell you. You will do whatever I want you to do. Do you understand? I'm not your property, Roman! Yes, you helped me and sheltered me, clothed, and fed me but... coming with you that night is the biggest regret of my life! I've had enough! I'm not your slave! Shit! Stop nagging! You bitch! You and your stupid mouth! I should just punch your lights out! - You're hurting me! - So you can be with your mother! - Want that? - Let go of me. Damn you. Shit... Okay, I’m sorry. Go on. Choose where we're gonna go. I don't want you to think I'm a bad person. And all right. I will release you on one condition. You will pay me one million pesos. I will tell you where your father is. You will get your freedom. But until you get me that, I'd like you to just do as I say. That's all I'm asking. So now, choose where we're gona go. Don't ruin the night. Please. Don't ruin for the both of us. I apologize. I'm not angry. Not mad at you. Come on. Just pick. Please. Don't be mad. Let's get out of here. Let's go. Come on. Don't be mad. Stop being angry. So? - Are we okay? - Yeah, okay. That's what I was telling you. You were gonna ruin our night. - I guess I'll go. - Yup. - Call me later, okay? - Cut it out! Hey! Good morning, Abner! Where have you been? It's too damn early for that attitude! What about you? Do decent women go home at this hour? Look! All the nosy neighbors are gonna be talking about you. So what? Are you my brother? Good morning, Mrs. Adeng! Hey. Morning it is. What happened? Why didn't you come home last night? I hope you don't take this the wrong way. After all, you might as well be my daughter. But of course, if you actually were my child, a young lady like you coming home at this hour, it's not a good sight, you know? What would the neighbors think? And then they see you step out of your boyfriend's car. But you know, to be honest, I don't mind what you want to do. I'm just saying this because I care. And as you know, I'm a teacher, Ica. I wouldn't like to be told that as a teacher, I have no power to straighten out those under my roof. Just take extra care, Ica, please? Okay? I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Adeng. I feel ashamed. You know Roman, if I don't do as he says, it's another big fight. But don't worry, this is the last time. Thank you for your concern, Mrs. Adeng. Not at all. It's nothing. You know, you'd better come join us. Come eat. Have breakfast. Here. There's eggs and coffee. - Hotdogs. - Ah, no need, Mrs. Adeng. I'm still full. What? I'll go upstairs. Abner, eat! We're gonna be late. Come straight home, okay? Yes, Ma. I will. - Are you sure? - Yep. - Okay, be safe! - Take care, Ma! - Okay! Okay. - Take care! - See you. - Bye, Ma. Take care! Bro, class is cancelled. There's a rally and ma'am is absent. Listen to me. You know what to do. Pack your things. Let's meet after three days. You already know where. It's just the two of us once this is done. Just make sure no one notices you. Everything will be alright. Holy shit, Abner! Ica! What the hell! You startled me! What are you doing? You're jerking off? Watching porn? What? No! You're wrong! I literally caught you! Don't deny it! You're jerking off! Yes, I was! I'm sorry! I'm such a dickhead. Don't be silly! How old are you anyway? - Seventeen? - Yeah. That's natural for teenage boys like you. At seventeen I wasn't even a virgin anymore. Don't worry. I won't tell your mom. But on one condition! What condition is that? You love picking on me just because you got me on a chokehold! Well, naturally! I will keep your secret. It'll be our secret! Okay, listen. This is my condition. Go to the store and buy me a napkin. With wings! Come on, Ica! Don't make me do that! I'm a guy for crying out loud! You're really gonna ask me to buy you a napkin? Your choice. It's pretty simple, really. I might mention it to your mom that her son is skipping school, jerking off, and a Peeping Tom. Don't! Don't tell her. I'm gonna do it. I can't let you tell mom I'm skipping school to jerk off. She'll slap me for sure if she finds out I'm peeping on you. Go on, then. You're a smart kid after all. Get out and buy my napkin. Sorry. It's because I have a crush on you. I've been fantasizing about you for a long time. "Sorry"? Are you nuts? Don't think about it. I totally get it. Jerkface. Get to it. Buy me my napkin. Yeah, yeah. - With wings, okay? - Yes! I'm excited. I think it's gonna be delicious. Don't worry. I'll teach you. Abner! - What? - I'm on my period, remember? Do you eat blood stew? I'm on my period. We can't! You know, Abner, this is my last day here. So thank you. Thank you for making me happy on my last day. Stop it with the drama. You're taking me out of the zone. I can take responsibility for you. Stupid boy! Let's keep this a secret, okay? Of course. Dirty little secret. Promise. But this, we can do this. Hurry up! Hurry up! Everything's set. We'll finish this tonight. Just make sure you don't get followed. Hi, Mrs. Adeng. Oh, hey. You're going out? I thought you didn't have work today? Besides, it's past lunch. Yeah. But I need to go to the store. My supervisor asked me to come in. He said he needs to talk to me. Oh, no. I'm gonna cook sinigang, your favorite. I didn't know you were going out. Will you take long? Yes. I might take a while. We might not even see each other again. What? Why is that? What's wrong? Are you leaving for good? Is that why you're carrying all that? I only meant that maybe we won't see each other again today, because you'll be asleep by the time I get back. That's what I meant. So that's it. - Mrs. Adeng. - Yes? Here's my payment for last month's rent. And here's my two months advance. So I don't spend the money on accident. Wow! Thank you so much! You're paying in advance now, huh? You'd better wait for dinner so you can have something to eat. Ah, that's okay. I really should be going, Mrs. Adeng. Can I give you a hug? Of course! Come here. Hang on. Is there a problem? Is something bothering you? Would you like to talk about it first? It's nothing. I just wanted to thank you because you treated me like family here, like your own daughter. I really appreciate it, Mrs. Adeng. Are you okay? - Are you sure? - Yes, ma'am. Okay. I'll go ahead. All right. Be safe, okay? When you get home, I'll save you some dinner. And thanks for this. No problem, Mrs. Adeng. - Take care! - Take care, Mrs. Adeng! Okay. Abner! Mom! Come down here. Coming. Buy me some okra. We're missing some ingredients for the sinigang. Our sinigang is missing an ingredient. Okra. - Mom. - Yeah? Was that Ica who just left? Yes. She said her supervisor called for her. But she'll be back. Go on! Buy me the okra. What are you standing around for? Okra! Mind you buy the right vegetable! Okra! Okay, mom. Okra. Okra! Okra, okra. I swear to god. I'm broke, sir. My salary keeps getting cuts. I've got nothing left to pay the bills with. You know, according to the records, you owe us a lot of money. I can do anything. What do you mean by 'anything'? Anything you want. I can't believe you're done, sir! Let me check your bag ma'am. - Thank you. - Let's eat. - Where do you want to eat? - Let me check your bags. Let's just go to my place. I will cook for you. - Then let's watch Vivamax. - Thank you so much! It's always Vivamax with you. Treat me to a movie for once. Thank you. Hi, Melai. Where's Ica? Huh? Ica's not here. Just tell me where Ica is, Melai. Huh? Her phone's not ringing, she's not online? I told you Ica's not here, Roman. Relax. She's on leave today. Then I went to your boarding house. They said she came here because your supervisor asked her to come in. Ica already told me your supervisor's harrassing all of you. They're probably doing something in his office as we speak. Tell me who this Galvez is. Where is he? Tell me where he is! There's Galvez. Are you Galvez? Are you Galvez? Are you? Hey bastard, where is Ica? Tell me where she is! What are you-- What do you mean "Ica"? How would I know? She's absent today. Where is she? Tell me! Why are you asking me? Don't come near me. Why are you closing in? I'm a police officer, back off! Screw you, you bastard! Don't you know? I'm a policeman. I finally have time for you. You bastard. Why are you harrassing my girlfriend? You son of a bitch. Damn you! Son of a bitch. Go inside first! Come here, you bastard! Get up! All you idiots turn a blind eye to this snake? So? He's harrassing all the female employees here! Now that you know, just do your jobs! Got it? You asshole! Hey, cut it out! Melai! Melai! Melai, wake up! Melai! Ica. What the heck! What are you doing here? Did you shoot Melai? Shut up. If I didn't shoot her, she'll identify you! She's a witness! You shouldn't have shot her. We don't have time. Let's go! Melai, sorry! Sorry! Shit, Ica, get out of here! Let's go! She won't hear you. She's dead! We're here live at Davidson's Department Store here in Caloocan City, where a fire broke out. According to reports and resources, the fire spread out too fast and took the whole building. Our firefighters are currently on the situation. Authorities are still investigating the origin of this incident. Sigrid Polon, reporting. This isn't the end of the story. Ica's story has just begun. Let's go, we're departing soon! Three more! Heading to Sapang Palay! Balintawak! Balintawak! He brought me to his home. He informed his wife Monica that I would be staying with them from then on. She's gonna be staying with us for a while. Don't we have a spare room? Wait. Wait, your niece? But from the very beginning, ma'am Monica didn't like me at all. But Roman would always answer for me. ...so I brought her here for a while. Is it okay? All right, fine. I'll get the room ready. Sure. Because of that, I endured Monica's mistreatment of me for two years. When Roman isn't home, - she treats me worse than a maid. - Ica! What the hell! - Are you trying to burn my house down? - I'm so sorry! She would hit me, curse at me. Monica! What's wrong with you? You're hurting her again! Again? Serously? She tried to burn down our house! Are you gonna take her side? Why do you have to hit her? - What good is she? - You think I'm taking her side? - Yes! That's what you always do! - Tell me, was it right to hit her? And what about you? You think you're doing the right thing? What's your problem? Shit! But that's not the worst of it. When I turned sixteen, Roman showed his true intentions. Often when ma'am Monica wasn't around, he would suddenly come home and feast on my young body. Be quiet, jeez. Don't fight it. - Your ma'am Monica isn't home. - Please don't, sir. I couldn't do anything. I was powerless against him. He would always remind me that I owe him for taking me in and that my father's life is in their hands. Come on! Nothing happened, okay? Nothing happened. Remember that. Don't tell your ma'am. Hey! Don't tell your ma'am, okay? Don't tell Monica! He said if I ever run away from him, I will never see my father again. Ica, there's a lot of-- You monsters! What is this? - I will explain! - How can you explain this? - No! - You bitch! I said I can explain! How? What the hell is wrong with you! - Let me explain! - How can you explain this? You're screwing your niece? - Stop screaming! - So you're the one who's mad? I'm going to explain it to you! Damn you! Let go of me! Let go of me! I wandered in the streets after that. Until the next day, Roman found me on a sidewalk. And he brought me to a hidden safehouse in Montalban, Rizal. He said it's where they hide away the witnesses in their cases. Police assets whose lives are in danger. And the victims, too, so they can be safe. I stayed there for a year. I was seventeen years old. I preferred my life there. Far from Roman, away from that devil. And that's where I met Mr. Narsing. He's also a police asset and the keeper of the safehouse. He takes care of all of us. He taught me to be strong. To be brave and smart. And that's where I formed my dreams, that one day, I will be able to escape from the shackles Roman placed on me and my father and I will meet again. Looks like I win this round, too, Mr. Ching. You have all the luck tonight. Are you sure you're not cheating? You're always winning. Me? Cheat? For what? This is just a game, Mr. Ching. Okay, then. One more round so we can win some of it back. - I'm in for another round. - Sorry, boys. I'm tired. We've been playing all night. Besides, I have a business meeting. Bullshit, Dave! You asshole, leaving after raking all the money. You're a jerk. You're just a bastard! Bastard! Listen, old man! Don't talk to me like that, got it? Screw you! Hey, watch it. Go ahead, try me. You don’t know me. Know your place. Where are you? I came from the province. I've been waiting for an hour. I'm at the crossing. Do you have a job opening? Sir, this way, sir! So you own this big building, sir. I didn't know you were bigtime. You should come in. I'll treat you to lunch. Ah, it's okay, sir. I should go back to looking for a job and a place to stay. Probably somewhere in Monumento. Are you sure? Here's my calling card. And take some of this money. For saving my life. Look for a boarding house near here. Then call me when you're ready. - Thank you, sir. - I'll take care of you. I will give you a job here in our department store. Thank you, sir. I'm grateful. Take care. And that's how Dave and I started our friendship. He secretly hired me to work at their department store. He had me trained to be a janitress. Until I reached my second year and became a stock girl in charge of inventory in the warehouse. And on my third year, I became a saleslady. But we had an agreement. That we would keep it a secret that we know each other. Because Dave wanted to have an eye, or a spy inside the department store. When I settled in my new job, that's when Dave took a serious liking to me. He would take me out on dates in secret. But all throughout our three years together, no one even noticed we were in a relationship. Because I'm not just a saleslady, I'm also a good actress. Dave and I have been keeping our relationship a secret for three years. And though I remained enslaved by Roman, and harrassed by Mr. Galvez, I endured all of it just to protect Dave. Because we've put some plans into motion and they cannot be foiled by my personal issues. A week before the department store burned down, Dave and I had all our plans laid out. And I have been preparing myself for this for a long time. In the plan, I will go about my work as a saleslady as usual. But I need to get in and study the movements of the people in the admin office. That's why I tend to make a scene and end up getting reprimanded so I'll be called into Mr. Galvez's office. What they don't know is, I'm doing all of it so I can snoop around and find where they keep the audit files. Here's the clincher. The truth is... the department store hasn't been doing so well for several years now. Dave's father has accummulated debts from numerous businessmen trying to keep it afloat. And in order preserve their remaining assets, Dave thought about setting the department store on fire. So that they can claim a substantial amount of money from the insurance company amounting to 250 million pesos. That's where I come in. So no one will notice. I will sneak into the audit department and burn all the important documents and files on the computers. By doing so, all evidence and documents that prove the company's going bankrupt will be destroyed. And there's one more thing Dave wanted me to do. He will send me the combinations of all their safes in the Finance department. All of the department store's daily earnings are kept there for a week before being deposited in the bank. So while we were at the resort, Dave taught me how to open a safe. I studied the rotation of the combination over and over again until I perfected it. Every part of the plan has been laid out meticulously. Even my death in the fire. Do you recognize this ID and wallet? Could you please identify? Yes, it's-- This is Jessica Fajardo. Ica. She's one of my tenants here. For five years now. Ms. Macatangay, we found her body at the burned down Davidson Department Store last Tuesday. Her face was almost unrecognizable due to the fire. We recovered only these IDs and her wallet to help identify her. I'm really sorry, but Ms. Jessica Fajardo is gone. What are you saying? Ica... Ica... You know, I will miss you so much. I'm getting so antsy. A bit nervous and unsure. Mixed emotions. Why should you be nervous? You did great! Once the insurance company's certification is issued, after the investigation, my father can claim 250 Million. So let's celebrate! Let's celebrate! - Congrats! - Congrats! The money's in the room, by the way. I didn't touch it. Not a single cent. That's yours. Use the money to create a new life. It's all mine? Thanks, Dave! I can finally see my father and pay off all my debts. Thank you. I love you, Dave. After this, we can't see each other anymore. Why? We have to end this. For your safety and for my family. Nobody can know that you're still alive. Nobody can know about us. I'm getting married. You know how it is. Papa's Chinese. Use the money to carve a new life for yourself. Just make sure no one can know about what we did, okay? How stupid can I get? How could I even think I'd have a chance with Dave? I'm nothing but a lowly saleslady. But thanks anyway, Dave. You became the instrument with which I can change my life. I will never forget you. And on this day, I will surrender my heart and soul to you completely. San Felipe! San Felipe! It's leaving! More spots left! San Felipe! San Felipe! San Felipe! Come on in! San Felipe! San Felipe! San Felipe! Few spots left! Celia! Celia! - Coming! - Damn it! - Come quickly! - Yes! We'll be right there! - Goddamnit! I'm exhausted! - Here we are! - Ica! - Ma! Come out immediately when I call for you! Yes, I know. We're here. Ica! There. Grab the rope. Then pull. Yes. Okay. - One. Two. Three. - Many years ago, Uncle Ruel came home one night, and he brought with him three corpses wrapped in burlap. Yes, dead people. Uncle Ruel worked as a hired killer. He gets paid to kill people. And to get rid of the evidence, he will remove the bodies from the scene and bring them home to us. It's part of the fee. And my mother and I would dispose of the bodies. That's been our life since mom left my father Dado. Mom cheated on him probably because of all the hunger and hardships we endured. Pretty soon she was switching lovers, and Uncle Ruel was one of them. And what's even more painful is that she took me with her to go live with her new man. I hated my mother! But there was nothing I could do as a child. No, please! And my mother didn't rescue me! She let a dragon devour me in that shanty that night. When suddenly, my protector came barging in! You son of a bitch! Let go of my daughter! You bastard! Son of a bitch! Dado! Why are you-- Get out of here! You shit! Leave us alone! You bastard. Ruel! You think you can just walk in here? - You son of a bitch. - Ruel! Don't! Ruel! Asshole! Take this! Shit! Ica, stop! Ica! Stop! Stop, Ica! Come here. Give me the knife. Let go! Let go of it! Listen to me. Darling, listen to me. You didn't kill them, okay? Goddamnit, Ica. You're just a child! Listen to me carefully. It was me! I killed them. I killed them! I killed them! Not you. Dad! Dad! Find me. Yes, Dad. Dad, be careful. Find me. Yes, Dad. There, there. Don't worry. I'll take you to your relatives. Do you know where they are? I have no relatives here. I have no family left. Go ahead. You can go. Roman took advantage of my innocence. Placing my life in his hands that day, was as good as resigning my soul to the devil to be sunk deeper into hell. Hello, Ica. You've been calling me nonstop since last night. Can you stop pestering me? Huh? What do you want? Are you in San Felipe yet? Damn you, Roman. I'm just making sure. I'll be in San Felipe soon. I paid you the one million. Did you receive it? You'd better make sure you gave me the right address to find my dad. If not, I'll come back for you and make you pay! You talk big now, huh? Hey. We've got nothing to do with each other now, you understand? So don’t call me again. Got it? You bitch. Screw you. Asshole! - Good day, sir. - Good day to you too. - Can I ask a question? - Sure. - Let's check the bag first. - Go ahead. The chief is over there. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning too, miss. Can I ask you something. Sure, what is it? I'm looking for Diosdado Fajardo. Ah, Dado! Yes, I know him! He's a very nice man. He has plenty of friends here. Because he's kind and we take good care of him here. - Really? - Absolutely. All the prisoners here know him. I would like to meet him, sir. Haven't you heard? During the pandemic, many prisoners were hit by the virus. Dado was one of them. Sir? Where is he now? He's already gone. His body was cremated immediately because that's strict policy at the time. Can you tell me your name so I can find it in our files? Miss? What's your name? I'll leave you here for now, Miss. I'll look for his files in the office. Are you Jacob? I am. You were supposed to be here hours ago. I didn't know it was in the middle of nowhere. We've been going in circles trying to find this place. Is that him? Yeah. Where's my money? Here. Thanks. I'll dispose of it.
