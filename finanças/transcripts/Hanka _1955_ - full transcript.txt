Wait for me and we'll go to the bazaar together. I can't, Mušan, Rifa is waiting for me. Just a little, so I can change clothes and wash myself. I'll treat you to the fair. I will, by Allah. I can't, I told you. I have to hurry. Rifa is hoping that we'll sell this as well. Sejdo Tahirović from Obik village has purchased, in the Bukovica forest area with the following cadastral number, and paid for this purchase, 30 cubic meters of forest wood for charcoal burning... 900 dinars. With tax 969. Here... and be careful not to cut more than the forester allocates. You could get punished... because there are no jokes with me! Are you preparing to go somewhere? Of course, my beauty. To the charcoal kilns. Do you want to join us? Huh?! Me!? What could I do for you? I just bother you. Mejra! Come with me to Rifa. I have something to tell you. Hanka! Tell Omer to get ready. Tonight we leave for the mountain. I bought a permit for charcoal burning. I'll tell him. Here is a pure amber necklace! Knives! Wallets! Here you go, folks! Well, what do you want for this necklace? 200 dinars. Here is the necklace! Knives, wallets! Here is pure amber! Knives, mirrors, necklaces! Come, people... Huh? What did Hanka like? The one over there. This pure amber necklace. 120 dinars. Here you are! Would you like one more? I'm paying. I wouldn't. Thank you, Mušan. Let's take a walk. C'mon, people! Hurry, in a little while, everything will be sold! Brothers! Look at Mušan-agha strutting among the beauties! Shut up, pauper... or I'll break your neck! Why are you so stiff as a board?! Come dance with us. You go with that rich man. I don't have time for idleness. But you had time to pee in Mejra's earrings, huh?! Hanka! Hanka! Look... Hanka... I got it for you. It's yours now. No... it's not mine. It is beautiful... and I like it... but it's not mine. Come on, Hanka... I give it to you from my heart. You shouldn't have bought it for me, Mušan. Why, Hanka? You know you'll be mine. And I'll buy you earrings. And bracelets. And everything... Everything you want. Stop it, Mušan. It's all for nothing. You can't buy our Hanka for silver or gold. Shut up, you drooler! Let him go, Mušan! What's wrong with you?! Mušan! Let him go! Mušan! Let the child go, you madman! Are you crazy!? You dare lay a hand on me, son of a bitch!? Hit him now! Strike when I tell you! Let it go, Sejdo. I won't now. One day I'll show him by myself! If you just touch him one more time, you know what awaits you. Why are you looking at me like that? It's not my fault that he always chases me. Maybe it is. You're glad that everyone stares at you! Sejdo! Wait! Sejdo is beating Mušan over there! How's that?! What are you saying?! Where? First, Mušan had a fight with Began. Then Sejdo had a fight with Mušan and now he's strangling him. But tell me where? Down on the stream below Hasa's garden. What happened? It's nothing. What's wrong? Speak up. What happened? That Sejdo meddles a lot in our affairs. I'll show that poor thing who's boss here! How are you, Omer? Will you be able to come with us? I can, I can. Don't worry. Do you hear, Sejdo? I hear! Do you know who is the head, who is Gypsy Leader in this village? I know. You. It's good that you know. I thought you forgot. Some time ago you started sticking your nose in other people's business and attacking people! I don't attack people but your son Mušan! Hanka saw how he started to beat little Began. Looks like you're defending him too!? I'm not defending him, I'm saying how it is. If you just pounce on someone one more time... - I'll hand you to the gendarmes! - Let it go, Gypsy Leader... Better tell your Mušan not to scare the children around the village. Or is it you who persuades him to do it? You'll pay me dearly for this! The three of you immediately go to repair the road in Bijeli Potok! Let's go, people! Forward! Be careful, my son, that Gypsy Leader doesn't get you into some trouble. Let it go, Omer. I'm not afraid of him. I see you're not afraid. But he hits below the navel so a man doesn't know where he's beaten from. I know him very well! I'm going to accompany Omer just to the crossroads. Omer! Rifa says to take care of your health. If you need anything, tell the first one who comes to the village. I will, daughter, thanks. And while I'm here, let me see you off. Well, come on. I'm not going any further, Omer. Go with Allah and stay in touch. All right, daughter. Now go home, and watch Rifa. How long do you plan to stay on the mountain? About three months. There will be no one to defend you from guys with necklaces. I can take care of myself. Omer! Omer, you old reveler! How are you? Ajkuna, you lizard! What wind blows you to these parts? I was in Sarajevo. Did some work at the court. Ever since you twisted old Širbegović's brain, you've raised your head! And you never visit us. You separated yourself from us as if you were not a Gypsy. Don't do that, Omer. Since my bey died, I don't even have time to rest. - The house, the mill and charcoal. - And those beautiful people... Shut up, you old man... And who is that one? Well, that's Sejdo, son of the late Ismet. Sejdo! Sejdo!! Ah, yes, yes... You don't remember me, Sejdo, do you? Ajkuna! I remember! How is your... What is your older brother's name? Avdo. He died last fall. He was crushed by a tree. Too bad. He was a beautiful man. Say hello to Aunt Rifa! And Bika! And Nura! And tell them I'll come as soon as I have some time! Who is the one next for her? I think the same as you... What is it, Mušan? Why are you here so late? Hanka... I have to talk to you. Come out... let me just tell you something. I can't, Mušan. It's awkward. Tell me like this what it is. Come on out, Hanka, when I ask you. Why are you like that?! No, not now. I'll see you tomorrow. Go home, Mušan. What will people say? Don't torture me, Hanka... You know how much I love you. Come out... - Or let me in the room. - No! Hanka... Open it. Don't be like that. Don't be afraid, Hanka, when I tell you. Let me in, just for a moment. Just to see you. I can't sleep... I'm crazy about you, Hanka... Open... Open! You won't open for me, will you!? You act like a saint! If it was Sejdo, you would open for him! Open!! Mušan, son... Calm down. Go home nicely. Don't embarrass us and your parents. Listen to your Rifa. Come on. Go with Allah. Hey! Sejdo! Go there to see something and make your heart skip a beat! I can't, Pašan! - Hurry, before they run away! - Hey, tell me, what is it! They must be the Mustaj-bey's! Come on, hurry up! Brother, why does the law prohibit stealing!? If a man were allowed to steal a horse like girls are stolen here, I'd like the one with the long mane. Oh... Here is one with a long mane. You can steal this one without any trouble. I see you're wooing again. What to do, when I like everything that is beautiful? Is Omer there? I brought something for him. Come on... This is a shorter way. Look how the charcoal kilns smoke. In the summer I'll have plenty of money too. So you will. And why are you telling me? What do you mean!? I'm telling you just like that. I like it, so I'm telling you. I'll get married in the fall. I wanted to tell you that too. Well, get married. Who's stopping you!? Have you chosen a bride? I have. Mejra? Even more beautiful. And does she want you? I'll turn her head. But it's not that easy, Sejdo. Ah, there's Omer! Omer! So you came, Hanka!? All alone like this!? Aren't you afraid of wolves? And beasts like Sejdo? Well, you know, Omer, that she likes to play with fire. Sit in peace, Sejdo. I'm not afraid of any of you. Here, Omer. Mum sent you clothes. There is also tobacco. - Is there any coffee? - There is. Hello, Hanka. Welcome, girl. Well, you really made us happy. You're a sight for sore eyes. Look as much as you want. Hanka, what's new in the village? - Did anyone get married? - Did Gypsy Leader hang anyone? What do you mean, hang anyone!? No way. He has changed completely. On Friday, he's having a party... and inviting the whole village. - To the last one. - Who, Gypsy Leader!? It's not possible! - What happened? - Good things came to him too. Mušan got sick... so he says he wants to cheer him up a bit... before Mušan goes to the army. And to show that the whole village is like one big family to him. - And when is the party? - On Friday. This week. So how long until Friday? Three days. Today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. When you sleep twice more, that's it. All the girls will be there. - And you! - Of course, me too. - I guess you will all come too. - We won't. - We have to work. - Don't do that, Sejdo! We are people too! Don't be like that, Sejdo. Let them go, be a pal. And you come too. We need to cheer up Mušan. As I said... you must be by her side all the time and watch for my sign. - How is your hand, Mušan? - It's good. It's good now. And your heart? Is your heart healthy and whole, huh? It's a miracle. The party hasn't even started, and Mušan came to life. Hey, players! - Hey, by God, today is Friday! - Of course it is. We're frying here and they're partying down there. - They're sipping cold brandy. - And eating hot lamb. They're dancing and wooing. - Dinner is ready! - Better to say, the potatoes are ready. Come on, sit down. After such a beautiful dance, it's time to eat. There are eat and drinks as much as your heart desires! Sit down... and enjoy! - Long live Gypsy Leader! - Long live!! Well, look at how generous Gypsy Leader is. - He really didn't spare any expense! - It's like cream! I didn't spare the best cattle for this party. I don't understand... I just can't wrap my head around why Gypsy Leader is throwing the party!? But it's certainly not without some benefits. It could be because of Mušan. To have fun one more time before the army. I don't believe it's just that... He's an old fox. I know him. Get up! Come with me to the Bey's stable to get the horses! And now let's toast to the health of our leaders. Tell me, children, which one of these gray heads is the wisest in our village? It is known! Old Ramo! - Long live Ramo! - Long live Ramo! And who is the sharpest female mind in the village? Tongue! What mind!? Who has the sharpest tongue!? And now, my brothers and friends, tell me... which girl in our village is the most beautiful? Hanka is the most beautiful girl! C'mon, don't be shy, c'mon! C'mon, Hanka, when he calls you. C'mon! C'mon! Well, now let me ask you, and I know what you'll tell me... Who is the best and richest guy in our village? Our first guy... Mušan! Long live! May their marriage be happy and prosperous! - Good luck! - Long live Mušan and Hanka! Let her go, dad, please! Leave me alone! Obey me, Hanka, when I speak to you like this. Don't be crazy. Don't be arrogant and insult us. The whole village wants you to be Mušan's, and you... And I don't! I'll marry the one I want, and not the one you want!! Watch out what you say. As long as I'm leader of this village, it'll be as I command! - But you can't command me! - Shut up! Don't talk unless I ask. Mušan! Come here! Let her go, good people. Gypsy Leader, what are you doing with my child?! If she won't go nicely, she will by force! Take her to my house! Let her go, you bastards! Is that so, Gypsy Leader!? By force, huh? And none of you finds yourself standing in front of him!? Shame on you! Get out of my way. Or I'll beat you like a dog!! Go and look for it now in the stream! Maybe the cold water will calm you down! Let's go. You will pay me for this. You... thief! You will remember! You found a horse. Well, I borrowed him from Mustaj-bey. And he knows you borrowed him? What can you do, when I'm lucky. As you can see, the kidnapping worked for me. But I almost broke my neck too... flying downhill. Thank you, Sejdo. It's time for me to go. Hanka! Let me ask you something... Ask. You're very proud. I don't know that I am. Is that what you wanted to ask me? No. Well... Do you love me? Did you tell me you love me? I didn't, but you know that very well. And you know. Do you love me? I do... Sejdo... My Sejdo... Mine? Forever. Do you want to get married on St. Elias day? I do! Let the bridegroom take her to his home. Sejdo! Give me the mirror quick! I'll also buy a gold chain and tie you... so no one steals you from me when I go to the mountains. Don't be afraid, Sejdo. No one will ever take me from you. I'm yours now... and forever. Forever? Waiter! C'mon, here you are. Order what you want. But only under 5 dinars. Sejdo pays for everything like the National Bank. A brandy... 10 kebaps... A glass of beer. A double brandy for me... 20 kebaps and a pint of beer. This one ordered for me too. - Go to...! - Fool! - What is it? - The forester asks me: "What's new, Gypsy?" "I come for a wood permit," I say. "First and last name," he asks. "Sejdo Tahirović." And you've been here before? Last spring? I have. And you've already sold the charcoal? I have. And you earned well? I did. And... you forgot your friends? I didn't. But why, sir? You know how it is... Man cannot live alone. By God, I don't understand you, sir. Are you really stupid, Gypsy, or just pretending to be stupid! How much wood do you need? Well... I think I could burn 35 trees this time. "What?!" he says. "You'd like to become a millionaire at the state's expense!" Ah... Look, look... There's your "friend". Romania Mountain is high, And full of hajduks... Also... Now we can make geschäft. We just have to wait a while. It's not extending too much, sir? Don't worry. Leave it to me! Do you want to buy charcoal? Where did you get charcoal!? I don't have it yet... but I will. There will be plenty of it. How much? Let's go in. Come on, guys! Push, push! So we can transfer all the charcoal by tomorrow. And when I get the money, I'll throw a party better than Gypsy Leader's! Watch out, Mujkan, for God's sake. It's like you're spilling my blood. It's not my fault. Wait, Gypsies! Stop! The charcoal is confiscated. You broke the law! You're stealing from the State, Sejdo Tahirović! How, sir?! Don't play dumb! I warned you not to tear down more than I allowed you to! And you'd have cut down the whole forest if we hadn't caught you! I have not broken any law! I cut down exactly 28 trees and none more. Here are the permits, so count them yourself. And you keep working. Halt! Don't go against the law, Sejdo Tahirović, and don't disturb the performance of my official duty! When you cut those trees under the hay, you thought we wouldn't catch you because they were hidden. What trees!? Have any of you cut down those trees, as he says? Speak up!! - We didn't, Sejdo. - We didn't, by God. Sejdo! Sejdo! Sejdo! Where is that son of a bitch so I can ask him? What's wrong with you, Sejdo?! Are you out of your mind?! Sejdo! Sejdo! But, Sejdo, stop! People, why are you standing there!? Stop him, if you know God! You can see that he's as angry as a lynx! Quickly! Sejdo set fire to the forge. No, don't go there! Better go get the gendarmes... What is it, son?! What for?! - In the name of the law, stop! - Don't move! I tell you... We are as bare as a finger. We don't even have a grain of salt in the house, let alone anything else. We sold everything... Sell the necklace too. The necklace!? And why not? As soon as I get out, I'll get to work. And I'll buy you another one! How will we live until then? Even if I had five necklaces, it wouldn't be enough. And an illness in the house. You know... I worry a lot about Rifa. What do you think, Sejdo... how about I get a job as a singer until this is over? No way, Hanka! Better find some other job. Visiting time is over. - Who died? - Old Omer. Omer Kurto. It's not stolen? Huh? Well... Shall I give you 20 dinars? Tavern "At Šaban's" Where are you, my honey? Where are you, my spiritual food? Where are you, my bright day? Don't, Sejdo! If not for the money she earned here, you'd still be in prison. Don't, Sejdo. You'd better wait for her in her room. Where are you, my hot sun? Where have you been till now? It's already been a week, Since you didn't come to me! The sun went down, Darkness fell, And I was left alone! The sun went down, Darkness fell, And I was left alone... Sejdo! My Sejdo... How?! You didn't escape!? I didn't. They released me early. For good behavior, they say. I know that good behavior. How much did it cost you? Hanka... Why are you always... running away? Come on! You know, Mum, my Sejdo will start working now so our house will sing again. You heard, he went to Mustaj-bey on the mountain for some big business. Sit down on the 3-legged stool. Eh, there is no one like my Sejdo... even in three Istanbuls. I know, my daughter. May Allah remove all trouble from us. There has been enough. - Sit, Mum. If you need anything, call. - All right. I only came to see you. I thought I'd never see you again. - How are you, Aunt Rifa? - Bad, my God, without my Omer. Hello, Mustaj-bey. You have good horses. Bring that back! - Take that one! - Well... I heard, Mustaj-bey, that you're preparing the horses for market. I could drive the herd and sell horses. No one will do it for you better than me. You're a good rider, without a doubt, and you know your job. But I can't trust you with the job. - Why, Mustaj-bej?! - Why!? You are too impulsive. That's in the past. I know what a serious job it is. I'm not a child. And do you call taking my horses without asking serious business? The Gypsy Leader told me everything. Take that one! Take that one too! I have to go. Stay with us, Hajka. - Rest and leave in the morning. - I can't, aunt. I really have to go. What is it!? If I stay here, I'll kill him! I'll kill him like a dog! What happened? I'm afraid I'll bother you, Rifa. Bother me how? You just stay. You won't get home while it's daylight. Rather than spend the night at an inn, sleep at my place. All right, Rifa. I'll ask Nazif what he thinks. Nazif! I hear you, Lady! Here I am now! Hello, Sejdo. How are you? Thanks to Allah, I'm fine. How are you, Ajkuna? So that's how you are! Can't even invite me to the wedding?! I have to go to Hasan for firewood. Bring Hasan, so I can see him too. What do you think, Nazif, should we continue our journey or leave early tomorrow? What's wrong? You look a bit tired to me. Whatever you order, Lady. But if you ask me, I'd spend the night here and leave early tomorrow. Wait! And how would it be if Sejdo got a job on my estate? And... Hanka and Rifa to go with him? True, you have to work hard at my place, but you can also earn money. Huh? What do you say, Aunt Rifa? For Sejdo and Hanka... it would be really good to leave. Thank you so much for taking such care of us. I can't leave Rifa alone. I think that such an opportunity couldn't be better for Sejdo. With the Gypsy Leader here, he can't do any work. Tonight you'll sleep in Nazif's room. - Welcome. How was the trip? - Good, Đula. Make his bed and make us coffee. Oh, Đula, my Đula, Your love makes me tired! These were left to me by the Bey. And I also bought quite a few. I love everything beautiful... You wait here, I'll be right back. Do you like it? It's nice, huh? It was brought by the Bey from Istanbul. He only liked beautiful and expensive things. He always said that nothing was beautiful and expensive enough for me. He loved me very much. Once he went all the way to Sarajevo to buy me a string of pearls which was sold by an old bey family. It was worth an entire estate. I didn't know you are so rich. What did you think, my Sejdo!? Not all Gypsy women live in a tent. You'll see much more. Oh, Salkan... How was your trip? - Did you finish that job in Sarajevo? - I did, Salkan, it's fine. How are you? This is Salkan, the supervisor at my workplace in the forest, and this is Sejdo... Aunt Rifa's son-in-law. Starting tomorrow, he'll work with us too. So you're some kind of family? My Rifa's family is also my family. Why else would I bring him to my house? Well, sure... Sejdo! Nazif invites you to dinner. Go rest now... and go to work tomorrow. Why the hell did you bring this poor man when we have enough workers?! Even too many! Surely I can employ my cousin on my estate!? What's wrong with that? Aunt Rifa's son-in-law... And that's some kind of family!? Play second fiddle. Tell me how things are going here. That's how we, bro, live here like gentlemen. The Lady is very good to us. A person gets attached to her quickly. Except when he quarrels with Salkan and gets thrown out like a sack. Watch out for her then! And then, my Đula gets so mad, so help me, it takes your soul away. But when everything passes again, a joy! Horses, you say!? Those are fairies, not horses. For example, that white horse there: The Lady paid 5 thousand for him. Once we went to... Good evening, Salkan-agha, here you are. It's good you came, our guest shouldn't be left alone. I'm just about to settle the horses... How long do you plan to stay? Two or three... at most four months. And did Ajkuna call you... or did you ask to come? Did Ajkuna call you? I'm asking you! Is it so hard to answer!? Why are you interrogating me like a gendarme?! And why wouldn't you answer me like a man? Do you know who I am? I know. I heard. You're the supervisor. I'm not just the supervisor! They talk to me differently too. I didn't learn any other way. You will learn, young man. That's what I'm telling you. C'mon, people, don't sleep! And that money for the oak logs stuck somewhere. I really need it now. It'll be best if you go to Sarajevo and stay until you solve the problem. To stay in Sarajevo!? So you came up with a plan. And I tell you: Take care! It's better for you to get rid of that Sejdo while there's still time. Because if you don't, I'll kill him! I'd recommend that you don't forget who you are talking to. I'm neither your wife nor your servant! We're only talking about jobs now. Well, we've always gone together before. - Why not now? - Because I can't!! You'll leave at dawn with Nazif. Isn't it nicer here than there, huh? She's so beautiful. Is that nice of you to say, when you're in my company!? Maybe it wouldn't be nice from your Salkan. But from me... why can't I? Where is Salkan now! What time is it? It's almost midnight. Shall we go home? My darling, Where are you walking? Sejdo, shall we? Hey, why don't you take me too? Hey, why don't you take me too? Hey, why don't you take me too? Hey, why don't you take me too? Sejdo... Sejdo, what's the matter? What do you have there?! - Where is Ajkuna? - I don't know, Salkan-agha. - She didn't say where she was going. - And Sejdo? He must be in the mountains. Meho, grab that charcoal. Don't step on it! Where is Ajkuna? I don't know... Listen... Leave me alone with that questioning. What?! You're going to tell me what I can and can't do!? You came here impoverished, and now you'd like to command!? But I'm still the master here! Go on, get out of here!! Immediately!! Take care, Salkan. What did the man do to you?! Ah, you're meddling in my affairs too!? Old bitch!! Get out of here, son of a bitch, if you care of your life! You'll all remember me... You'll know who you're dealing with! Good... This flour should be sifted. Good. There's Salkan. Tell him I'm not here! Where is Ajkuna? She isn't here. There you are, you liar! You think money can do everything!? Now I'll show you that it can't! You wretch!! I'll kill you like a bitch!! Zuko, help me! Quickly!! Quickly!! There, Zuko! You killed the man! You killed Salkan! I did. But you won't go to prison, don't worry. He'll be swept away by the water, so no one will know. I won't tell anyone what you did. Salkan was here a while ago. He asked for you. He had a fight with Sejdo. - He's already arrived from Sarajevo!? - He has. What was that, Sejdo? If not for these people, there would be blood. I'll tell you later. Shall we go? No... We'll wait and then we'll go with them together. Bring Sejdo Tahirović. Did you kill Salkan? I didn't! Tell me, why did you fight with him? He attacked me first. Why did he attack you? - He couldn't stand me. - Why was that? I think because... I was supposed to become a supervisor like him. - Ajkuna Širbegović has arrived. - Good. Take him to another room. We'll continue later. - Oh, good afternoon, Madam. - Good afternoon. Please, have a seat. Sorry, Madam, this is a mere formality and I hope we can be done quickly. We'll get straight to the point. So, Madam, do you know about the fight between Sejdo and Salkan? I do... but I wasn't present. - When did you last see Sejdo that day? - That same night. Where? In my house where he spent the whole night. - The whole night? - Yes, the whole night. The witnesses are the maid and the coachman. I see. And... Do you know who might have a reason to kill Salkan? I don't know. But... I heard there are many people in the city who couldn't stand him. Thank you, Madam. Bring Sejdo. There, you see, Madam... it didn't take long. You are free. You can go. But don't leave the city without my permission. Goodbye, Mr. Captain. Goodbye, Madam. Pardon. One more question, please. Are you happy now that he doesn't bother us anymore? I am. And who killed him? I don't know... And what does it matter to you? You!? Let it go... The main thing is that I saved you from the investigation. And you saw that the sergeant suspected you. I'd do anything... I'd do anything for our happiness. I believe you would too, huh? But our happiness, my Gypsy, is not complete yet. There is something else... that has come between us. - Are you Hanka? - I am. I'm from Ajkuna. How is my Sejdo? - Is he healthy? - He's healthy. When will he come back? Don't wait for him anymore. He lives with Ajkuna. - What did you say?! - You heard. He lives with Ajkuna. I've been tending to them for a month. Here, they sent you money to remarry. Whose money is this?! Did Sejdo send it to us? Hey, we're blessed with him. Hey, we're blessed with him!? Blessed are we... You're lying! You're lying!! It's not true! Say it's not true! It's not true!! He'll come... I know for sure he'll come. Then he'll pay me for everything he's done to me. Mušan! Hey, Mušan, can't you hear!? Would you fix my loom? What's wrong with it? Come and see. Come in. What needs to be fixed? Here, this pulley gets stuck. It's fixed. Thank you, Mušan. Sit down. We haven't talked in a long time. Why do you act so distant? What do you mean! You're a married woman. Well, I am... I am a married woman. You excite me. You're playing with me. I'm not playing, Mušan. How can I trust you? When I bought that necklace, you didn't want to receive it. It was different then. It'd have been much better if I'd received it then. Would you accept it now? - I would... - And you're not kidding? I'm not kidding. Buy another for me and you'll see. Why should I buy another? It's still at home. - The very same one? - The same one. You want me to get it for you? I do... Đula! Where is she? I don't know, Agha, swear on my life. She didn't say anything to me when she left. I know! I'll find her! Where are you, my honey? Where are you, my spiritual food? Where are you, my bright day? Where are you... ...when her husband comes by! ...my hot sun? You're such a jolly man, Captain! It's just a pleasure to be with you! Ivan! One more. Where have you been till now? It's already been a week, Since you didn't come to me! The sun went down, Darkness fell, And I was left alone Sejdo... My Sejdo... - Mine? - Forever. The sun goes down, Darkness fell, And I was left alone Where are you going, Sejdo-agha? What will I tell her when she asks me? Tell her she's an ordinary slut and a scumbag. And that she'll die on the gallows. Good evening. Sejdo, son! What brings you here so suddenly!? Welcome home. We haven't seen you for so long. But all that matters is that you came back. Have you come permanently? I don't know. Sit down, Sejdo. You must be tired. I'll go make you coffee. Hanka! I admit... I got mixed up with Ajkuna. But whatever it was, it's over. I'm back now. I see you're back. You're just a little late! But still... There was some benefit. Look... Take it to the one who bought you for that money! Hanka! You forget that I'm still your husband! You, my husband!? In what way!? Listen, Hanka... If you had come with me... nothing would have happened. But now it's all over. I give you my word. I came back to fix everything. We'll start over. I'll buy our house. We'll get things... And when we're together again, everything will be as before. Trust me, Hanka! Aunt Rifa... - Here... I'll buy you dresses. - Have you seen Hanka? - Silk ones... - Aunt Rifa... - And I'll buy you... - What, Mušan? Is Hanka at home? No, she isn't. Well... she is, she is. She's in the house. She's sick. What's wrong?! Today she was healthy. Did something happen? Nothing serious. Her stomach hurts a little. You're acting a bit strange tonight, Aunt Rifa. Go with Allah, Mušan. Go on, go on. Go with Allah. What does this mean?! Nothing... How nothing!? Have you been carrying on with him?! What is it!? What will you do now!? - You sent me money to remarry! - What money!? And now you're sick of him coming here! What were you thinking!? And what about your oath of fidelity to love!? Do you want me to tell you, Sejdo Tahirović? You spat on both love and fidelity!! That's what you did! And with whom... but with that trollop to whom you sold your youth and our love! For dinars. For suits. For a drink! For an easy life! Why did you come!? What will you do to me now!!? Go to her!! It's true... I was crazy... when I sacrificed myself for you when you were in prison. And most of all I was crazy... when because of you I rejected Mušan... who was always fair to me. I was crazy... - but I'm not anymore!! - So that's it! Then go to him and those bastards!! Go so I don't dirty my hands!! Sejdo! Wait! What is it?! Why are you angry at each other? You love each other and you're fighting!? One side needs to give way. And preferably both. Sit down, Sejdo. Have a coffee. And you, Hanka, don't go crazy... He's your husband. What are you looking for, Sejdo? To quench my thirst with something. - Is there brandy in the house? - There's not a drop. But I'll bring it. I'll borrow from Hasan. Why did you call me? I was in pain, so I called you... And where is Hanka? You know her. She got up early, son, and went somewhere without saying where. How can she not say where?! She probably went to Mejra's. But don't worry. She'll be back soon. But let me make you coffee and then bring us some firewood. I see, Mum, you don't even have firewood for coffee. I'll go for it right away. And she didn't say when she'll be back? She didn't, son, but don't worry. She'll be there before you come out of the forest. So, can it ever be like it was before? It could be... that Sejdo is not so sure of your love. - Why? - Ah... When men are too sure, they think they can do whatever they want. And most of all I was crazy... when because of you I rejected Mušan... who was always fair with me. Sejdo! What happened to you, Sejdo?! Why did you leave me so suddenly?! Why are you pretending?! What are you looking for here again?! Leave me alone! But listen, Sejdo! I want to talk to you seriously. You forgave him too quickly. If I were in your place... You didn't tell anyone about Salkan, did you?! - That's why you're here! - Don't think that I came out of fear! I have nothing to fear! If anyone should be happy this thing is over, it's you, Sejdo. Don't forget that I saved you from prison! Sejdo! Sejdo! Get lost now! Hanka, what's wrong?! Let me go! You disgust me! Go to that bitch!! Be smart, Hanka. I'm telling you, I broke up with Ajkuna forever. And you still don't know how it all was. It's over when I tell you! Neither pleading nor force will help, I'm not afraid of you! You're no longer my husband! - I found myself another! - What!? You know, you lost me as soon as I found out what you're like! What did you say?! There! I was living with Mušan! What good are you to me? Even today I was with him! You're lying! You were at Mejra's! That's where we meet. And I'm carrying his child. So you know!! Hanka!! Here, let everyone hear! - Listen!! - Stop!! I'm carrying a child!! I am carrying Mušan's child!! I am carrying Mušan's child!! I am carrying Mušan's child!! Do you love me? Do you? Hanka... Anyone else have anything to say? I do. So what is it? Not a trace. I just can't believe it. There, you see... I said I didn't even touch her.
