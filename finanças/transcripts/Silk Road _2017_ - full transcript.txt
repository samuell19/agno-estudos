THIS FILM IS PART OF THE TELEFILM SERIES THIS FILM IS BASED ON TRUE EVENTS You could say there are three worlds. Most people live in the first. They're just doing their thing without thinking twice about it. There is a second world too. That of the men with the biggest mouths. They make the rules. For the good of all, they claim... but they are the only ones reaping the benefits. Behind one and two is a third world... my world. Where everyone prefers to stay invisible. Here you decide what you do and with whom. Though it isn't always clear who 'whom' is. THREE MONTHS EARLIER Nice ride. Thank you. Do you play The Cube? You should try it one time. Hey. These are the interest rates and the real production... in the secondary and tertiary markets, set against the money market. Can anyone tell me how we call this intersection? Daphne? IN TEN YEARS I'LL BE A MILLIONAIRE OR I'LL BE IN JAIL - Equilibrium? - Very good, Daphne. Woken up? Good. So if the IS-curve shifts right, equilibrium occurs at a higher rate. I'm trying to hack his computer. I've found his IP address and network password... and there is no advanced firewall. - But you aren't in yet? - No. You had something to classify exploits, right? - I sure do. - So can I get a link? Please? Impressive. How did you get my number? Do you have any plans for tomorrow? Two o'clock, my place. Okay. - Hi. - So nice you're here. Okay. We were supposed to keep it to ourselves, but you won't tell, right? What? You're going to be an aunt! Congratulations! - Well, congratulations to you. - Yes, thanks. - But I won't be changing diapers. - No. Oh yeah, and... if it's a girl, then... we want to call her Eva. Mama would have loved that, right? - Piece of cake? - No, thank you. I'll see you tonight. I have to do something. See you later! Hello. I'm here to see Raymond...? I'm Daphne. I live across the street. Iris Groeneveldt. Don't mind the mess. I can't accompany you because of my hip. It's upstairs. Hi. Do you take your coffee black? Yes. Take a seat. Realize that what you did is a crime? And you work for the police? Does anyone know you're here? No. What were you looking for on my computer? Nothing. - Nothing...? - No. Really, it was just a joke. Are you always that curious? I wasn't spying on you, I just couldn't sleep. Did you see anything last night? No. No... No. Sorry. Doesn't matter. I'll put on clean clothes at home. The bathroom's over there. A second ago it felt like you wanted me to leave. Would you like to make some extra money? Where is that coming from? Nowhere, never mind. I have to go to work. What if I had said yes? Then I'd have asked you to come to church tomorrow at five. Alone. - And what would I have been doing there? - Will you come or not? So what are we going to do? Deliver something. A packet of biscuits? Okay. I want you to deliver this to Frans van Balen. Yes? It's pretty much risk-free. So why not do it yourself? Okay... first you get the envelope, then you hand over the box. Do not get played. No names, no personal information, no nothing. Just that envelope. Okay? And is there a reason I should trust you? Because I trust you. Hi. I'm looking for Frans van Balen? You're here about the order? Hi. Frans. This way. Welcome. It's all in there? Yes. I would like the envelope first. What's your name? I expected to see Annemarie. Is this your first time? Do you work for that guy from Woerden too? That... - What's his name again? Richard? - Just give me the envelope, alright? - No, thanks. - No? Smart guy... lets others do his dirty work. Could you put me in touch with him? I'm willing to pay, this is not some indecent proposal. Hey, wait. Thank you. Bye. - Would you like to do this more often? - What's on the USB stick? You can tell me something, can't you? Just what you need to know. Okay. Say I'm dumb enough to do it again... Then what? Install this on your computer. Create an account with a new email address. The rest is self-evident. Okay, bye. Wait... And don't spend it all at once. Hi. Agnes, she's... gotten her period again. Yeah. I think it's a good idea to spend some quality time together. Like see a movie. - That's fine. - Okay? Okay. Good. Folks, this is Ben Hassin. He is your new colleague. He worked in IT for a number of big banks. But starting today he'll lead our Silk Road investigation. Ben. I managed to crack all your personal passwords. It was really quite simple. It was only to show security needs a look at around here. Interpol's already on our case... because our country's internet XTC trade has grown spectacularly. Okay, get to it. Ben. Hi. Sem. - I'm Raymond's business partner. - You got to be kidding. Congratulations. You passed with flying colors. Come. - What are we doing? - Pick something up. Not you too... Let me guess - an order? Or did you order something yourself? Silk Road. Reminded me of Amazon. If you already have all the answers, why ask? I just want to know what I'm doing here. Raymond says you're the best person to help us. A gift from God. He said that? He normally doesn't take to people. Not right away, in any case. Coming? Thank you. You work only for Raymond? I work with Raymond. He comes up with the plans, I say if they're feasible. And Annemarie? She doesn't exist. Thanks. Join me for something to eat? - Alright. - Okay. See if there's anything you like. - Well, I feel just fine in this. - I know. But Raymond says it's important in our line of work that you don't stand out. I'll be right back. - How much is in your account? - Enough. - And you said we shouldn't stand out? - Get in. Looks good on you. I feel like an Easter egg. Thanks. Silk Road means innovation. Total freedom. So the pinnacle of freedom is every nut being able to buy a weapon on internet? Or can order someone killed? You've really checked out the site. - Does that really happen? - Don't know. What I do know is that the people who claim they're protecting us... are mainly busy appropriating stuff. The bitcoin belongs to everyone. Did those boxes contain what I think they did? What did you think... when he asked you to do a job? I don't know. Did you need money? - I don't like talking about myself. - Why not? It's boring. Shall we have a drink somewhere else or... We could do that. I'm meeting Raymond in a bit too. Okay, one drink. - What would you like? - I'll have a gin and tonic. Two gin and tonic, please. Thanks. - Want to try? - No. No? You're sure? - Thanks. - There you go. Cheers. Come. - Hey, Ray. - Hey. - Fine, and you? - Fine, thanks. You want one? Yes, give me. Be my guest. It's a quarter, you'll be fine. Is this yours? - Yes. - Where did you get this? Bought it on eBay, very cheap. You can have it. But how are you? Yeah, fine. But sweet of you to ask. What are you doing here? I might ask you the same thing. Well, I'm here for Raymond. Okay. - Ray! - Yo. Come here for a sec. What? - Hey, Daphne. - Hey. Good that you're here. I just hope you know what it means if we let you in now. Well, what does it say in the General Terms & Conditions? You could go home. And forget all we did together. No harm done. Don't take someone's word at face value, my mother always said. They didn't have your face. Well... Welcome. Yeah. You have to put on gloves. Hungary, Oakland, New York, they're going everywhere. Bologna, Frankfurt, Marseille, Bucharest, Washington, Seattle, Caracas, Oslo. So, I like to continue from yesterday. And I would like to draw your attention to the divergence in growth... which has surfaced among emerging and advanced economies. Which you can see here on the left, the advanced... - Come! - Come in or leave. It's one or the other. Sorry. Bye. We've been hacked by the police. I can't get hold of Raymond. No idea where he is. You got to help me. - I'm not Raymond. - You can try, can't you? Come on. It has to be one of these IP addresses. We're on twelve now. They got to be in here. Okay, give me the data we used last. What are you going to do? Something. Where were you, man?! We've been hacked. What are you doing?! - The number is going down, right? - Yes. - Ten. - I tried to reroute them... to an unsafe IP address. Yes, but you're leaving traces. - Come on. - Eight. How the hell could this happen? I suddenly had to create new accounts. I warned you about this. Yeah, I think you said you had it under control, right? Seven. That code has already been used. Six. I have an idea. Yes. Shit, what a fucking mess. Five. Let me. Fuck. - Three. It's got to be one of these. - Yes, I'm going to send in a team. Two. - I got them. - Yes. Get in position, get in position! - Police! Police! - Hands on your head. Look down, look down. In the car. To be perfectly honest, it was a great year! But... what happened the other day... can't happen again. I don't want any of us face to face with the suppliers anymore. Okay? I only want intermediaries, a lot more intermediaries. We won't be logging in from home either, won't use our own IP address. We'll just use public places. Cafes, bars, whatever, not from home. That way we reduce the risk... and we'll become motherfucking big. Oh, yeah. I have one more small present. Sick. - So! - Ours, baby! - Do you know where Raymond is? - What? Do you know where Raymond is? At his mum's, I think. What are you going to do? I have to get home. - Hey. - Hi. Good morning. Oh, yes... Thank you. So, Daphne. Where did you get this? Bought it. Where were you last night? Daphne? I didn't get much sleep, so I want to go upstairs for a bit. No, I want you to answer when I ask a question. Where were you last night? Daphne, you can't just come and go as you like. This is not a... Sure. Listen, I understand you really miss your mother, but that's why. Just talk to me. I'm twenty, I have my own life. Where are you going? I'll call you. Hey. Hey. Maybe I should have warned you. Thanks. Josefien went to school with Raymond. Didn't give him the time of day back then, but now all of a sudden... Okay. I understand. I can understand you're in love with him. - Hey. - Nonsense. - Nonsense? - Yeah. Has he already mentioned Venezuela to you? No. Yes? Yo. He is here. But don't tell him what we talked about. What was the matter? Nothing. I just didn't feel like seeing my dad. Well... Sorry, I would have loved to help you, but I... No, it's alright. I can sleep at Sem's. There was no need for you to come. It's best if you resolve things with your dad. Thanks for your pity, but I'll be the judge of that. Daphne. When fathers get worried... they can start asking difficult questions. We really shouldn't want that right now. Okay? He's right. Really. I must confess that I was a little confused at first. Daphne may be a few years younger, but... Now I know that luckily it's mutual. Right? It should feel good, of course, and that means it's good. - Absolutely. - That's how we were in the beginning. It's already starting to feel like a real relationship. We'll get there. That's good to hear. - Because, well, I did worry a bit. - Dad... I only want you to know that I'm not mad or anything. That's all. Josefien? Yes. It might have been better if I'd introduced you to her myself. I've thought about intermediaries. I know someone. Or do you consider me an intermediary? I was just about to suggest giving you a bigger cut. That's not an answer. Do you want that or not? Have you thought about it? And? Why are you asking me anyway? Because of me, or just because you need someone? Both. Come. You just take the envelope, that's it. Okay? - Okay. - Did you bring the phone I gave you? - Yes. - Okay. It's pretty much risk-free. I don't know if we should continue with Jimmy. Why not? You had doubts too when you started, right? Hey... Have you ever seen him? Where did you get this? That is Gert Tiggelman. Head of cybercrime. He was behind the recent hack. - We could get him on our side. - How? He has to pay alimony to two ex-wives, and nets 2000 a month. And... beautiful women are his weakness. Send in Josefien. What? Do you want me to sleep with him or something? No, Daphne. I'd like you to feel him out. If he bites and we get him on our side, our position is stronger than ever. - Sir. - Yes, thank you. Do I know you? No. But I know who you are... and what you make. You can use a little extra money, can't you? You've got two choices. You don't cooperate and your boss will... Fine, I shouldn't have asked her, okay? Yeah, but now they've seen her! Could you please get a grip, man? There's a fucking big order coming. If you put Daphne in that kind of danger one more time, I rip your fucking head off. You want to forget about that deal? Someone else will simply make it. So what? They've never been active on the web before, remember. And you weren't right about that detective, now were you? I was wrong about Daphne. Sorry. - We should shut things down for a while. - Shut down? - You want to shut this down? - Yes. South America's biggest distributor wants to get in bed with us. - Oh well, let's shut it down. - Have you forgotten your own rules? Get the fuck out of here, man. Never take customers who want more than we can offer. The deal has already been done. Maybe we should start with a small quantity. See if this customer checks out. At the very least. Okay. Who's driving, you or me? I'll go. With Jimmy. Do you see that man on the bench? Get the bag. He knows. Go on. It's gonna be alright. Jesus. - Shouldn't we just go to the police? - No. There must be something we can do. Daphne. Did you give Jimmy his phone? Yes. Then we can find him. Okay. I don't think any of us would care if we let those guys disappear, right? Don't be ridiculous, man. - This isn't a fucking game. - I know. Hey. We're the ones who wouldn't use violence, remember? No, but we need to show them who's boss. Sick. What do you intend to prove? That you're willing to kill? What do you want to do? Come up with a better plan. Want to go to the police? If we go the police, then I can't vouch for that Jimmy and neither can you. Are we all cool with this? What if we say no? Fine, let's not. Jimmy is your friend. I'm not going to call this. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello? Yes. Taxi is outside. Hey. No kiss for me anymore? Come, sit, come. Sleep well. What are you going to do? I'm quitting. I should have done that a long time ago. I've bought a piece of land in France. An old campsite. It's a pretty spot, you could come with me. It should never have happened. Never. The three of us decided this. What did you say? - The three of us decided this. - You can't be serious. I've always admired him, even more than you did. We were in the crib together. Our mothers were friends, but he is losing it. Completely. Brilliant people like him become really dangerous then. - What are you going to tell him? - I'm not going to tell him anything. If he hears about this, he'll waste me! Raymond would never hurt you. No? You think you know him better than me? Just don't say anything to him. Hi. Well, well, Paris, that is real nice! You're lucky to have a boyfriend like that. I think your father and sister are jealous. Yes, it's romantic. Your mum and me went to Paris together too. Did you know? Just like you, spontaneous, driving down there, breakfast on the Champs-Élysées. A delight. I think we should get moving. Or we won't be there before tomorrow. Bye! Sorry. But we really need to lie low for a while. After that, we travel on to Venezuela. Come. We can't make any more mistakes. SHOOT-OUT ROTTERDAM LINKED TO SILK ROAD Hey Jimmy, hi. Great to see you, man. Is Daphne home? No, she's taking a short holiday. So nice you two have stayed in touch. I believe Daphne is in danger. Watch out, watch out, watch out. Isn't it too early for Venezuela? You sound like Sem. What else did he say? How long have your parents been separated? Sem says that changed you. - Bullshit. - So why would he say that? You. You are very special. Sem saw it right away, I'm only really seeing it now. That is what has changed. Don't answer it. Nobody has to know we're here. You understand? Okay. - Hi, hello. - Hello, Leo van Dam. - Tiggelman. - Jimmy Levant. - Sit down. - Yes. Thanks. I have a daughter. Accounts have been emptied, I discovered it by accident. - How much is gone? - Half. I'd like you to contact him. - But half of that money is his. - Half is his, yes. But I don't want him to do something stupid which could expose us all. Hey. Hey. How are you? - Fine. And you? - Fine. But I discovered something funny. Bitcoins have been stolen. Who says, Raymond? Do you know anything about that? Of course I don't. You sound a bit worked up. Where is Raymond? Gone. Okay. Have you made up your mind about coming here? You're welcome. I'd understand if you'd taken half the money. You're more like him every day, do you know that? What, you think I'm going to confess now? So you do have the money? Forget what I said. Don't call me. Sem, wait! Maybe I'll come to you. Where are you? Raymond? I'll get us tickets. Once it's all arranged, I'll call. And I'll see you at the airport in a few days. Okay. Okay. See you in a couple of days. A road accident in France... claimed the life of a 22-year old man from Woerden. The nature of the accident points to an underworld hit, says the police. A team has been assembled to investigate further. Witnesses are urged to come forward. If you have information about this man or possible suspects... please call the police hotline. Hey. Good of you to call. Everything's fine. I've taken care of it. We leave in two days, business class. Have you heard from Sem? No. You? No, me neither. - Shall I try to get in touch with him again? - No, don't. But he is your best friend. He was. FATAL ACCIDENT DUTCH MAN But I'll see you at the airport in two days. I've already researched everything. I'll send you the information. And then I'll see you there, okay? Venezuela will be fantastic. I promise. I'm going to get some more sleep, okay? Yeah, do. Sleep tight. I'll think of you. Bye. It's here. Hi. Hey. Sit down. Do you know Sem Koster? He died yesterday in France. Did you know Sem? Sem was a friend of mine. Do you know what happened? I understand it was an accident. Suppose I have proof... that it was a murder. Another murder? What are you talking about? Hey. - Everything okay? - Yes. You? Yeah. I named you after your mother. 'Eva Lucassen'. Fine or not? 'Harm Lucassen'. I'm ready. Let's go. Hey, we can still call it quits. We don't have to do it for the money. Do you see yourself doing nothing at the beach all day? No. What? Coming? Hands up! Put that bag down! Mister Tiggelman. Is the news from South America true? You've had help from inside? Well, we're dealing with one of the world's biggest online drug dealers. Daphne? Who is this? This really was a resounding success for us. No casualties. You know who this is. But that's impossible. The police found me before they found you. Are they biting? Ben Hassin, police. I didn't want to go down for what Raymond pulled. So yeah, I co-operated with them. Just like you did. But I thought that Raymond... Please come down here. We're a much better match. Hello? Daphne? SILK ROAD WAS SHUT DOWN BY THE FBI IN 2013 I thought about... going back to the first world. A fine world for most people. But it's no longer an option for me. Dancing to the tune of the Second World people, doesn't appeal to me either. And I don't have to. Because I'm getting better every day. They say love is blind... But I should have trusted in love. 1238 days to go. Then he'll get out. And then we'll disappear, into our own world. FOLLOWING THE TAKEDOWN OF SILK ROAD... ILLEGAL INTERNET TRADING IN OTHER FORMS AT LEAST QUADRUPLED
