[mysterious music] [thunder crackling] [thoughtful music] - I want my baby. [electricity crackling] [people yelling] [gasping] [unsettling music] [singing in foreign language] ♪ I'm getting bored ♪ Are you sleeping ♪ I'm getting bored ♪ Are you sleeping ♪ Brother John ♪ How long do we ♪ Have to sing this song ♪ Down the road [singing in foreign language] - Okay, now we played 50 games of 20 questions. We have sung every song known to the western world. I think it's time that somebody tell me where we are going. Come on, I had a million things to do at the gallery. [laughing] - Awe. - Yes indeed, I did. Alright, I love a mystery as much as anyone, but if someone doesn't say something very soon. - What are you gonna do Kar, you gonna get outta the car and walk back to Manhattan? - Karen, why don't you just relax and enjoy yourself? It's your anniversary. - Eric please, I can't stand it any longer. Rita, Rita tell me and I will loan you, no I will give you that Tunisian belt I bought last week. - She knows nothing. Nothing. - Oh god I love that belt. - Rita. - There it is! Turn, turn. - I know, I know. I see it, just relax. Relax. - [Rita] I'm relaxing. I'm very relaxed okay? - Oh Eric, you didn't. When did you plan all this? I mean Rita can't keep a secret for 10 minutes. - Oh thank you very much. - Whoa Karen. - I know. - Do you guys have any idea how long I've wanted to come to Unionville? - No Karen. - [Both] How long is it? - Thank you darling, for a wonderful present. - Small print. [laughing] You know where are we exactly? - [Charlie] The star in Unionville see, and it's this small print. - [Rita] Oh there? - Eric stop the car. - What? - [Karen] Stop the car. - What, what, what is it? - [Karen] Back up, back up! - [Eric] What is it? - Oh antiques. Well, Karen's writhe in heaven. - [Karen] What do you say, can we have a look? - Sweetheart there's probably dozens of antique stores down in Unionville and that's right down the road. - [Rita] Don't be a party pooper. - Oh this is supposed to be an adventure. - [Eric] It's probably just a farmer selling some old furniture. [mysterious music] - Oh Eric, isn't it wonderful? - Yeah, yeah, it's nice. Honey, we've got reservations at Unionville's newest hotel. We got three rooms, a king sized bed, a hot tub, color TV. [chuckles] Karen? - Um hmm. - Oh come on. Now what about Charlie and Rita? They got reservations there too. We can't. - Can't we just go inside? Oh no. Not your lawyer's face. Please, just have a look? - Come on, we'll go in and take a look around. Five minutes. - Are we in trouble here? - Eh, it's nice. It's rustic. [sighs] - Oh, what can I do for you folks? - I didn't mean to ring the bell. We're just browsing. - Oh everything is so beautiful. Looks exactly the way it did 200 years ago. - Well it's all quite authentic ma'am. - She knows, antiques are her life. Do you think we could get a little drink? - Well the tap room isn't open in the afternoon ma'am, but I'd be very glad to draw you a ration of grog. - Capital idea innkeeper. - [Innkeeper] You're very welcome, thanks. - Well I knew there was something I liked about Colonial times. - Honey, I know what you're thinking. This is a great old place. But we already have reservations at another hotel. Charlie and Rita. - Speak for yourself dear. I think it's adorable. - There you go sir. [ominous music] - Is something wrong? - No, no, not a thing ma'am. Drink up, it's on the house. - She doesn't drink. - Grog is not merely a drink, darling. It's history. To our perfect vacation. And to our two closest friends. - And to whomever designed the chambermaid's blouse. - Oh Charlie. - Um, tasty. - Not bad. [Karen coughing] - A real bar fly, huh? - Are you alright? - Excuse me. I didn't know it was so strong. - So now, can I offer you lodging? We are cheaper than any hotel in Unionville and it's just 10 minute's walk to the center of town. - No thank you, we already have-- - I think it's charming, Mr? - MacVey. - Mr. MacVey. Don't you think so Eric? Especially when it's your anniversary. It is her present, you know. - Eric look, there's no TV and I hate going to sleep without Johnny Carson, but I think Rita's right. - Alright, alright, alright. - Make Karen very happy. - Majority rules, majority rules. - Tell me, do you have anything resembling a honeymoon suite? - Well I don't think they had that sort of thing back then, but I can offer you a very cheerful room with a fine feather bed. - A feather bed. - Hmm. Alright Mr. MacVey, you got me. - [Mr. MacVey] How long will you be with us Mr. Beckett? - [Eric] Well we'll probably be staying for the weekend. My wife, she wants to go to this Governor's Ball? Now, where do I sign? - [Mr. MacVey] On the top here sir. - On the dotted line as they say? - We're staying! Oh I love you! - We're staying if I can sign. - And I love you. - And I love you. - And I love you. - Oh I love you. - Thank you so much. - Oh anytime. - Well now, welcome to the Lamb & Lion. The boy will fetch the bags. Thomas, bags. Keys. See he's my sister's boy. He's a little slow, but he's a very good worker. Oh come along ladies. I'll take you up while the gentlemen finish signing the register. - Hope you're gonna miss that hot tub as much I am. - This is a lovely, sunny room. And there's a fireplace here to keep you warm in the evening. It's wired for electricity and has a flush toilet. - Oh joy, flush toilets. - No, this is pretty nice. What do you think Kar? Kar? Karen? - I'm in here. Isn't it breathtaking? - In more ways than one. - I know it sounds crazy. But I love this room. - Honey, I wouldn't get too attached. It's obvious that this room is in no shape for us to stay in. [gentle music] [eerie music] - What is this? How did you get in here? - The door was open. - No, that's not possible. I locked it myself. This room hasn't been opened in years. Why it's no matter, but, I'm sorry, this room is not for rent. There's no electricity and just oil lamps. - Well that's wonderful! I don't mind, do you Eric? Oh it'll be just like living in Colonial times. - Look, there's no hot water. It would have to be brought up by hand. - I'm not that Colonial. Let's go. - Look, I'll show you a room down the hall. It's just across from your friends. It has a great view of the whole valley. - Honey the man can't rent us the room in the shape that it's in. - You'll be much more comfortable in a room with some modern conveniences. - Hot water. - I like it. It's got possibilities. [gasps] Charlie look at that mirror. Boy would I love this for our bedroom, Charlie. - Yeah, always wanted something with antique dust on it. - Alright, alright. We'll stay here if he can get it cleaned up by this afternoon. - You've only the fire for heat. - Oh we don't mind. We could always use extra blankets. - Can we have a little extra straw for the mattress? - I'm sure it's a feather bed. - Yes it is indeed. Well dinner's at eight. - You know with a little cleaning up, I think this place'd be terrific. - You know I think I'm gonna make that old guy an offer on this mirror? It's got erotic carvings all over it. - He gets excited 'cause Winnie the Pooh doesn't wear clothes. Come on Charlie. They wanna be alone. Bye guys. - Bye. See ya later. Half hour. - Thanks guys. - Happy anniversary sweetheart. - Oh Eric, this is such a thoughtful present. [laughs] Stop looking at me like that. You're embarrassing me. - There you go reading my mind again. [gentle music] - Oh Eric, wouldn't this be just the perfect place to start thinking about having a baby? - Sweetheart, you and I have the rest of our lives to think about having a baby. Right now you and I are very special. And I know you wanna start that gallery and Charlie and I've been wanting to open our own law practice. Now look, it's not that I have anything against wanting a family, it's just that, right now it's not the right time. It's not the right time for us. Look, I gave in on, I gave in on this hotel room. Now you give in on the baby. Okay? At least for the weekend? Deal? - Okay deal. - [Crier] Hear ye, hear ye, come one, come all to the Governor's Ball this weekend. - [Karen] It's wonderful. - [Crier] Hear ye, hear ye come one, come all. - Oh honey can we stop in? - Sure come, come on. - [Crier] Come one, come all to the Governor's Ball this weekend. [crowd chattering quietly] - That's the first shop I've-- - Karen the gallows, come on. Come on guys. - I don't believe. - Come on Eric, Eric get up there, we'll get a picture of this. This'll be great. - Oh great. - Alright you got the camera? - [Karen] Look at this, I can't believe this. - [Charlie] Come on Karen. - I can't believe this. Look! - [Rita] Alright now Karen put the noose around Eric's neck. - Oh Rita, that is sick. - This is great, this is great. - Put the noose around his neck, please, thank you. - Eric just do it, come on, do it. - Come on Charlie, no. - I am the director, you have to listen to me. - Listen, come on come on, put the noose around your neck. - Okay, take the picture, hurry up. - [Charlie] Tilt your head and stick out your tongue. - What? - Tilt your head. - Pull it like this. - And stick out your tongue. Tilt your head and stick out your tongue. - Like that? - Great, great. [dramatic music] And then, now that's it, great. Great, now one more. - I like that. Come on. - [Charlie] Just like you did before. It's great, it's great, good. Go on then put your hand down. Put your hand down for a second. Got it. - Did you get the picture finally? - Terrific. - What the hell is the matter with you? How could you just stand there? - I don't know. - Gees. - Eric take it easy. She was just caught off guard. Weren't you Kar? - I don't know. - Look, it was a stupid thing for all of us. Come on. Come on. Come on Kar. - You alright? - Yeah, I'm fine. Look I'm sorry. I shouldn't have snapped at ya like that. But this, we shouldn't even gone up there in the first place. Are you okay? - I'm fine. Can we just go, please? [unsettling music] [electricity crackling] Darling? - Yeah, what is it? - I just, nevermind. I was looking for my comb, I found it. - I like your hair like that. It's very sexy. [group chattering] - [Man] Drink a whole thing at once. That's it, one, two, three. - Just having a ball. They'll never change. - How many times have you been to the ball? - [Man On Right] Several. There you go. It is getting a little warm. - [Man] Oh yeah. Feel better. - Much better. - Eric, you oughta get old Kar sloshed more often. [bright fiddle music] - Oh! [group clapping] - Yes. - Whoo! - Good girl. [group applauds] - Oh! [laughs] That was so fun. Oh that was so much fun. You should've tried it. - You okay? - I'm fine. Why? - I don't know, it's been a long day and it's getting kind a late. - Wanna go up to bed? - You do taste a bit on the groggy side. [laughing] - Oh, oh Cinderella lost her slipper. - Terrific. Don't you move or you're in big trouble. [unsettling music] - How did you get there? [sensual music] Eric, you naughty boy. [electricity crackling] - You look absolutely beautiful. [unsettling music] [bright music] [gasps] Good morning. What are you doing up so early? - I couldn't sleep. - I gotta tell ya. Last night was without a doubt. - Was without a doubt what? - Well words beyond that are mere superlatives. [laughing] - [Woman] Where's the pen? - [Rita] Thank you so much. - [Man] Excuse me. - [Man] Out in front. Pleased. - No. - Okay we got. - [Man] The covered bridge, we'll go down to that river that guy was telling us about. - [gasps] Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were standing there. - Oh I see you're quite taken to Megan McGuire. There's quite a story there. - It's her eyes. They are so alive. - Yes. Yes they are. Excuse me. - I'm sorry Karen, you ready? - Yes of course. - Okay campers, let's go. Come on Kar. - There it is over there. - Great! - The costume shop is right down here. The one we're gonna see. They've got all the costumes we need. No, not the really low one. Maybe to here. - [Crier] Governor's Ball, lovely ball this weekend. [sighs] [sneezes] [speaking in foreign language] - Very nice. - Thank you. - Karen Karen, come here, look at this. - Rita these are real antiques. - Karen those are rags compared to what we need for the Governor's Ball. Oh Karen, imagine swishing around the dance floor in this all sort of cinched up in a whalebone corset. How do you like it? - It's not your style. You should find something more flowing. - [laughs] Flowing. Karen I'm not exactly ready for matron wear yet. - It's just that women with your problem should be careful of what they wear. - My problem? - It's just that you have very strange tastes. - Karen, what is the matter with you? - If you don't want my opinion, don't ask me for it. - Do I detect a little testiness here? - Well apparently Karen doesn't like my taste in ball gowns. Or in clothing in general. - If you don't care about fashion, it's alright with me. - Wait a minute, now we're all friends here. We're going to a costume ball and this is supposed to be fun, right? - Right. [sighs] - I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said what I said. - [Rita] It's okay kiddo. [sighs] - What about this one here, huh? Dash of color. Now this is nice. Red like this, huh? - That is an authentic cotillion gown made in the colonies. It is not a copy. Would you please not drag it on the floor? - Tell me, who wore that, Scarlett O'Hara? - Scarlett O'Hara was a fictional character. This was actually worn to the Governor's Ball by one of our more colorful, if less savory characters, a local barmaid called Megan McGuire. You will have to leave a credit card with me for security if you want to rent it. - [Charlie] No, no thanks. Red's not really my color either. [unsettling music] [laughing] - [Rita] I lost it. - [Charlie] Go out, go out, go on. - Okay. - Go on. - Okay. Hello. Goodbye. Okay honey, here ya go. - [Charlie] Okay. Oh! [laughs] Ri! - You haven't said 10 words since we left the costumes. Karen what is it? What's the matter? - Nothing, why do you ask? - Well I could point out a few moments in the past 24 hours. - For instance? - Well that squabble with Rita. And those men last night. I've never seen you flirt like that. And that performance you gave in the tap room. I mean that was really the real capper. - I had too much to drink. - Well that's what Charlie thought. Except I kept my eyes on you and you were sipping from the same glass of grog all night. - Eric, why am I being cross-examined? - I'm not cross-examining you. I'm merely pointing out a few things that aren't like you. - What am I like? Do you even know? - Well yes I should hope so after four years of marriage. - Then where's this questioning going? - It's not going anywhere. I, I'm simply concerned that you're not feeling well and I wanna help. That's all. - There is nothing wrong with me! - Hey, where are you guys going? - Ah, we'll catch up with ya later on. Karen! Karen! Karen. Dammit Karen, where are you? Kar? What are you doing? - Can't you feel them? They were here. A very long time ago. They made love. - Who was here? - I want you to make love to me. [sensual music] - You mean right here? - Yes. Right here, right now. - Karen. - I want you. - [Eric] Yeah but what happens if someone... - You're trembling. Are you afraid of me? - Why, should I be? - No. I want you. Do you want me Eric? [unsettling music] [moaning] - It's killing me! [yelling] [baby cries] [yelling out] - Help. Nurse. Nurse. Help. Nurse. Nurse. - [Woman] My baby. [electricity crackles] - My baby. - Karen. [gasps] - Oh Eric. - Yeah, you're having a nightmare. - It was so real. - I know, I know. It's okay though, I'm right here. Alright, why don't you tell me about it, huh? Hmm? - I dreamed that I was in a kind of prison. I could smell this damp stone, I could feel the cold floor. There was a woman in my dream. I watched her baby being born. - You're just having a nightmare, that's all. - Eric, I think the baby was me. - [laughing] With your mother being a charter member of the Beacon Hill society, I doubt she's ever been near a prison, let alone inside one. [laughing] - [Karen] Maybe she's not my mother. - What was that? - Nothing. I'm so cold. - Listen, I got an idea. Tomorrow morning after breakfast, why don't we, why don't we go home? You take a week off and get some rest, huh? - No, I, I don't wanna do that. It'll ruin everything. Anyhow you're right. I was just overreacting to a nightmare. I'm fine, really. - You're sure. - Um hmm. [thoughtful music] [electricity crackling] - [Eric] Here's what I'm thinking. - What's going on? You look a little tired. - I mean it's probably nothing. Thanks Thomas. - I'm fine right here. - It's just that Karen hasn't been acting like herself these last couple of days. - Aw come on Eric, she's just letting her hair down. This is Karen's vacation too, you know. - You wanna talk about it? Maybe we could help. - Alright. The other day at the costume shop, when she barked at you, I mean that's not like Karen. And then Charlie, her little dance in here the other night. - No. - What about her crazy behavior on the gallows? - No, look, sometimes people get into an emergency, they just freeze up. - I think Charlie's right. She just got scared. - No, but there are other things. - Like what? - Last night Karen dreamt that she was being born inside of a prison. I know, I know, that's not that bad. But Karen believes it. She thinks that her mother in Boston's not really her mother. You figure it out. I mean I can't even reach her. - Eric, are you back? [unsettling music] [ominous music] - Eric maybe it is exactly the right time. - No Rita, Rita-- - You know she's been wanting a baby since you first got married. - Rita that shouldn't be the reason for her behavior. - [Charlie] Um hmm. - Alright, okay. Maybe I'm overreacting. [sighs] Thanks for listening. - Anytime. - Eric! Eric! Eric. Eric, the blade I... - Let go of the blade. - I can't. - Let go. - I can't. I can't. - Charlie! Rita! - [Woman] What's going on? - I'd still like to get her to a doctor. - The blood made it look worse than it was. I think you'll be fine now, won't you madam? - Oh yes. When I found the drawer in the fireplace, I just took the knife out because I wanted to look at it. I guess I squeezed the edge without realizing. I feel very dumb. I mean I've obviously ruined everyone's day. - No, you haven't. We've got plenty of time. Now why don't you just go rest. Okay? - Oh no, I'm fine, really. - Really? - Really. - All that time and neither man nor beast could find it. And she came upon it just like that. - You mean people have been looking for it? - Oh yes, yes yes, they have. - Why? - Well it was used in a crime of passion over 200 years ago. And it's been missing ever since. - Do you mean that a murder was committed in this room? - This Lieutenant Eisley, was he the murderer? - No, he was the victim. - Yes. He was. - [Eric] [laughs] How did you know that sweetheart? - Just a guess. Darling, can we go on a carriage ride today, please? - Anything you want. - Well this here is your town limit. That there is your old graveyard. Back in the 18th century Unionville buried its dead, rich and poor alike here in this one cemetery at the outskirts of town. - Looks a little rundown to me. - Driver, can we stop here at the graveyard. - Surely you can miss. Whoa there. - Karen, Karen do you think that maybe we could have something to eat before we read gravestones? - Why don't you guys go on ahead to the restaurant. We'll catch up with ya later. - [Charles] Eric, I'll get it. Put your money away. - This is her grave. - Whose grave? Megan McGuire? Isn't she the one in the painting that MacVey's always talking about? - The barmaid whose room we're staying in. - You're full of information today. Now how did you know that she was in our room? - I'm sure Thomas must have told me. Megan McGuire, 1761 to 1786. Hanged by the neck for the murder of Lieutenant John Eisley. God have mercy on her soul. - Eisley, the man killed in our room. She murdered him. I wonder where they buried the poor lieutenant. - How do you know he didn't drive her to murder? Some men do that. Pledge their love, then turn their backs on women. - Well I wouldn't call that justification for murder. - No, but I don't think you should pass judgment so quickly without having all the facts. I thought trial attorneys knew that. - Oh Thomas will fetch the firewood for you Mr. Beckett. - I think I can handle it. Mr. MacVey, I would appreciate it if you could ask Thomas to stop talking to my wife about the murder in our room. It's just no way to make your guests feel very comfortable. - Oh Mr. Beckett, Thomas can't remember a grocery list much less historical stories. - Well my wife isn't making it up and it's obvious she's hearing about Megan McGuire from someone. - Well it's common knowledge among the locals that Megan killed Eisley in that room. - Is that why you locked up the room? - I closed up the room, Mr. Beckett, for the reason that I told you. Too expensive to run up the plumbing lines. - Well I guess if I wanna know more I'll have to speak to the locals. - Alright Mr. Beckett. If you insist. More than 20 years ago, some months after I bought this inn, I learned that a woman had murdered her husband up in that very room. Well you make it silly of me, but I'm superstitious. And I decided that I would close up that room for good. And that's the truth of it. [unsettling music] Two murders in the same room and that was enough for me, Mr. Beckett. [eerie music] - So. You're not afraid of me are ya? - I knew you were there. I could feel you. - And do you know who I am Katherine? - Yes. You're Megan McGuire. Why did you call me Katherine? - Well that's your name, girl. - No, you're wrong, my name is Karen. Karen Beckett. - I think you'll soon be finding out that your name is Katherine Raymond and that's a fact. And this dream of yours, of being born in a prison, now that's a fact too Katherine. - How could you know about my dream? - We're kindred spirits, you and I. You're of my line Katherine, like my very own babe and all of them that followed. It's only that you've chosen to hide the truth down in dark places. But you can't do it any longer, can ya? Your true feelings are coming out in all sorts of interesting ways. - What do you mean? - Oh come on girl. Don't tell me you can't see how your man ain't wondrous pleased with your new bed manners. - Eric loves me. - No man loves a woman, only what he takes from her. He gets her with child and then he spits in her face. - No, not Eric, he's not like that. - Blood to blood Katherine. Ya can't fight it. You'll do what ya must when your time comes. - What do you mean when my time comes? No, wait! - When you're with child, Katherine, then you'll know. Then you'll know. Then you'll know. - No, please don't go. No tell me what is it I'm going to do. Please tell me what is it I'm going to do. - We have to talk. - About what? - [Eric] Whatever's bothering you. - Is this shirt clean? - Forget the shirt, Karen, this has gotta stop. - Look I told you I don't wanna talk about it. I mean in the bloody hell can't you understand that? - What did you say to me? - You heard me. - Alright, that's it. We're going back to New York tonight. - Now look, I don't wanna leave Eric, please. I don't wanna do that. I can't do that yet. - Karen this is crazy. - Eric I love you. Isn't that enough for you? - It's the mirror, isn't it? Is that what's bothering you? Is it the mirror Karen? - No. Look, let's just stop this. - Karen there's no mystery to it. There's just some glass. There's nothing to be frightened of. Gotta move this thing out into the hallway tonight. - No, don't do that. Please. You're gonna hurt yourself. - Okay fine, I'll have Mr. MacVey move it in the morning. [tense music] [door slams] - Eric, you sure you guys don't wanna be alone? 'Cause we can walk ahead. - No, no, we're fine, really. - There's Karen. - Great, let's go. - Okay. - Good morning. - Morning. You look terrific. - Thank you. [men grunting] - Oh, this is as heavy as sin. We need a dolly. I'll be back in a minute. - Okay. [ominous music] [rumbling] [yelling] [panting] [laughing] - If you're a very good boy I could buy this for you. - You know I love you. - Excuse me, miss. Do you know anything about this, Megan McGuire? - Oh I'm sorry, I'm not that good with local history. You might try Mr. Goode, the archivist over at Beggar's Church. - Where is that? - Two blocks down. You can't miss it, it's red brick. - Oh I'm sure it's right up here. Sweetheart I'm gonna go back to the inn. I'm feeling a little queasy from lunch. You go ahead and go with Charlie and Rita. - Well if you want, I've got some antacid in my clothing bag at the hotel. - Really I think I'll be okay. - You sure? - Yeah. Go on. - Okay. - See you later. - [Charlie] I think it's gonna look great in the apartment. - [Rita] Yeah, so do I. - I think we can still make the parade. Kar, come on. - Hello! - Ah, almost got you. - I'm looking for Mr. Goode. - Uh, Beggar's Church sextons have always been called Mr. Goode. Sorry, times have changed and I haven't. Well, what's on your mind? - Well I'm looking for information about Megan McGuire. - What do you wanna know? - Why she killed John Eisley. - Writing a book? - No, just curious. My wife and I happen to be staying in the same room where the murder happened. - Is that a fact? I didn't know that MacVey had opened it up for rent. Said he never would after the Raymond woman. - Why do you think MacVey would do that? - I'm an archivist, not a mind reader, Mr.? - Beckett, Eric Beckett. What can you tell me about the Eisley murder? - Well there's not much to tell. Megan McGuire was a loose woman who set her cap for Lieutenant John Eisley in hopes of gaining herself some respectability. They had a lover's quarrel and she stabbed him to death with his own bayonet. As I recall the murder weapon was never found. Times being what they were, they hanged Megan anyway. - And Elizabeth Raymond? - What about her? - Well it just seems odd that there were two murders in the same room. - I deal in facts, not fancies, Mr. Beckett. You should do the same thing. - Well then tell me about Elizabeth Raymond. - Mrs. Raymond, Mrs. Ray. Elizabeth Raymond stabbed her husband for sure. She even admitted it, though they never could find what she murdered him with. They executed her in the electric chair. About six months after her baby was born. Over in Weemsville Prison. Maybe 30 miles across the river. Went crazy they said. Talked about being possessed with some evil. Whatever. - Did Elizabeth Raymond have black hair? - She did. - What happened to her child? - Don't know. - [Eric] Was it a girl? - Whatever it was, it was probably turned over to the state home. Most relatives don't want tainted babies. Tourists. - Mr. MacVey! Mr. MacVey! - Mr. Beckett! When you return to the inn, I would like you and your wife to get your things in order and vacate the room sir, I have another for you. - Wait a minute, what's going on? - There's been an accident Mr. Beckett. A bad accident. The handyman was taking the mirror from your room. He fell from the window and was killed. I've had to tell his widow. - Oh my god. - Oh I doubt that God had much to do with this, Mr. Beckett. - No, you're lying to me. - Are you deaf or what, girl? Couldn't you hear the hate in his voice when you're only after talking about having a baby? Now Katherine you listen to me. - You stop calling me that name. - Katherine you are and Katherine you'll be. If it's the truth you're wanting wait 'til your belly swells with child then see what kind of a man he really is. - Eric loves me. - Love is lies girl. - Eric is not like that. - I will no matter that you won't listen. It's all true. It's true and you know it. Your man doesn't deserve to live. You're blood of my blood Katherine. Like your mother before you and her mother before her. All the way back to me. You'll do what you have to when the time comes. You'll do what you have to. - I thought you'd be sleeping. Look, something terrible's happened. [sensual music] - I tried to tell you not to move the mirror. - Mr. MacVey wants us outta the room tonight. I agree with him. - [Karen] I have something else in mind. - I think we should get your things together and get out of it. - No, not tonight. - Yes, tonight. Right now. - Oh I told you I'm not leaving this room tonight. I want to make love again. - No, come on. - No come on I just wanna go with it. - Karen, please. - Tell me that you love me. - Karen, would you cut it out and listen to me? - Say that you love me. Say that you love me dammit. - Karen! - Say that you love me! - I don't even know you anymore. [Karen laughs] - Eric. Eric please, forgive me. - I spent most of the evening walking. Thinking about us. - Eric please. I'm so frightened. - What do you think I am? I don't know you anymore. You're like two different people. - I can't put it into words. Only that what she says can't be true, it just can't. - Who? Karen, who says it can't be true? - Call it a ghost, call it a spirit. I don't know. But there is something in that mirror and it's in the form of Megan McGuire. She knows about my dream, about being born in prison. She knows about us. She says my real name is Katherine Raymond. And she says that you-- - Sweetheart look, now can't you see what you're doing to yourself? You're a very artistic, impressionable person and you're allowing some idiotic ghost story totally captivate your imagination. Now look there is no ghost in there. Granted Elizabeth Raymond lived near here and died in prison, but you must have heard Thomas or MacVey or someone else telling the story. Then you connected it with the Megan McGuire myth. But it just simply isn't true. - Elizabeth Raymond is my mother's name? - Mr. MacVey wants us out of here. - No! I can't leave now until I know what she really wants from me. - Karen this just simply isn't rational. Look do you want me to prove to you that there's nothing to this mirror garbage? It's glass and it's wood. There's nothing inside. There's no inner spirit, no ghost living inside. Nothing. Go ahead. Tell her do something to me. Come on, come on out. - You just don't understand. - You can go on blaming the supernatural or you can just accept the truth. - Eric please listen to me-- - Oh no no no, I love you and I'm not going to stand by and let some idiotic nonsense about a mirror destroy our marriage. - Charlie and Rita are waiting for us. - The hell with Rita and Charlie. I'm talking about us. And if you can't accept that there's a perfectly rational reason for your problem, and stop defending yourself with ghost stories, then you're a-- - Mental case? - I didn't say that. - No, but that's what you were thinking. Everything is so logical for you, Eric. Question and answer, black and white. [sighs] - Ghosts. - Karen are you okay? - Where's Eric? I thought he was coming with us. - Karen? [upbeat music] Karen slow down. - [Rita] Karen, please slow down. - Karen. - Karen. - Watch out, watch out. - Karen slow. - [Charlie] You're going too fast! - [Rita] That car, watch out! [tires peeling] [car horn honks] [onlookers exclaiming] - [Woman On P.A.] Dr. Peggy Brown, 5328, Dr. Peggy Brown, 5328. Dr. Pure, Dr. Pure. - A mild concussion and an abdominal bruise from the seat belt. She's very lucky. Are you the husband? - No, no the husband was supposed to be back at the hotel. I left a message. - And I assured her that the accident won't affect her pregnancy. A couple of days in the hospital, she'll be fine. - Pregnancy, what pregnancy? - Well we had to check her out for internal injury. It's standard. And I think she's about seven weeks along. You didn't know? - Uh no. - No. - No, we didn't know about that. - Well, no charge for the diagnosis. You can see her now. - Well, I guess Eric won't have much choice in the matter now. - I'm sure he'll take it in stride. - I'm not so sure Karen will. Honey look. Oh no. - [Charlie] What the hell's she doing outside? - [Rita] Charlie. - [Charlie] Got it. Karen, Karen! Karen! Eric, she just jumped in the car. I couldn't stop her. - Well how could you have left her here alone with the car keys knowing the state of mind she's in? - Now wait a minute Eric, she seemed okay-- - But she's not okay. - She's okay to drive. - She's not okay. She hasn't been okay since we first got here. That's what I've been trying to tell you guys. - Eric, Karen's pregnant. - What? - Your wife is pregnant. - How could I have been so stupid, I... - Look, she probably thought you were gonna be angry, so she just took off. - Look, I've gotta find her. Did she say where she was going? - No, she took off at about 60 miles an hour. I don't think she was too interested in talking. - I think I know where she's going. I think, can you guys catch your own cab and I'll call you later. - Yeah, sure, no problem. - Thanks. - [Guard] She's in there. - Raymond, Elizabeth, executed for the murder of her husband, September, 1955. I'm sorry Mrs. Beckett, that's all I'm permitted to tell you. The warden says Elizabeth Raymond's records are closed to anyone but blood relatives. - I told you, I think I'm her daughter. - Think is not proof in our book. - I know she had a baby. Can't you just tell me the name she was given. - We've never said it was a girl, Mrs. Beckett. Just the name and nothing else. - Yes. - Baby Katherine. [ominous music] [phone rings] - Hello? - [Karen] Hello Mother? - Sweetheart, how is Unionville? Did Eric surprise you? - Yes it was wonderful. How's Daddy? - Oh he's fine, he's right here, say hello. Darling? Are you alright? You sound very out of sorts. - I just haven't been sleeping well. Mother, I'm in Weemsville. - Oh, honestly Karen, I can't imagine why you'd want to go to a place like that When Unionville is so lovely. - [Karen] Mother I went to the prison. - Bob, she was at the prison. - Hey pussycat, how's my girl? - Daddy, who was Elizabeth Raymond? - Karen now don't go blowing this whole thing outta proportion. Baby we love you deeply, you've gotta believe that. Karen. Karen! Karen can you hear me? [upbeat music] [sobbing] - [Woman] I wanna show you something. - [Man] Oh yeah. [woman yelling] - Look, don't worry about it. Keep the change. - [Man] You're looking good lover. - [Woman] Gees, leave me alone alright? I'm going home. - [Man] Something step right here. - You lose. - Let's see what you can do with it. - Oh you'll see what I can do. [men whistling] - Looking good Kathy. - [Karen] Um hmm. - [Man] Five bucks a game. [Karen laughs] [men cheering] - Whoo hoo! - [Man] Lucky. Don't get nervous Kathy. - [Man] Hey, what are you trying-- - What the hell do you think you're doing? - That's funny, I was going to ask you the same thing. - Hey Mack, the lady's trying to take a shot. You know? - Hey Mack, she's not taking anything, but a cab back to Unionville. - [Man] Whoa! - Look, the lady's my wife, okay? - You've gotta lotta nerve, you know? - This guy your husband, Kathy? - This guy look like anybody who'd be my husband? [men snickering] - Kathy says goodbye. - Hey, her name is not Kathy, it's Karen. And she's obviously too drunk to know who she is. Especially if she's with someone like you. - You guys just gonna stand there all night breathing hard or are you gonna get rid of him? - [Man] Yeah, yeah come on. - I said adios. - I'm not leaving here without her. [grunts] - [Man] Hey! [punches thudding] [men exclaiming] - Great, can't any of you baby faces handle this guy? - Karen, let's get outta here before somebody really busts me up. - I don't know what you're talking about. Leave me alone. Get away from me. - Back off! I said back off. - You get away from me. [punch thuds] [crowd exclaiming] - [Man] You sure you don't know this guy, Kathy? - I said I didn't. Now leave me alone. - Great hand I have here. - Charlie just discard. Hi. - Hey, where the hell ya been? - Where's Karen? Eric, what happened? - Seems that having babies is not the only thing my wife wants to experience. Here are the keys to the car. I'm going back to New York. - Wait a minute am I missing something here? Or isn't Karen pregnant? Eric come on, where is she? - Charlie your guess is as good as mine. But if you wanna find her I'd start looking at every bar and pool hall in Weemsville. - Eric are you walking out on her? Well she needs you now more than ever. - She doesn't need anyone. - Charlie do something. Stop him. Charlie they're our best friends. - Now let's forget about Eric. We gotta got to Weemsville and find Karen now. - Dammit Karen. [unsettling music] My god! Karen was telling the truth. You're Megan McGuire. What do you want with Karen? - Oh I want nothing from Katherine. She needs no help from me to follow her birthright. - Birthright? - All my kin come to this room when they're with child. They come here to follow the fire that burns inside. - You're talking in riddles. Dammit what do you want with Karen? - Oh you stupid, stupid little man. [yelling] [rumbling] [ominous music] You really think you're a match for me, you miserable weakling. What a pitiful show, I swear. - I'm gonna kill you! - If it's a killing you want, you've come to the right place but I won't be doing any of the killing. Oh no, it won't be me. It won't be me. - The time my suspicions were confirmed and I realized who your wife might be it was too late. - What does Megan's ghost want with Karen? I've got to know MacVey! - And I've got to accept this matter as truth. Just as you have. I... Well I know a bit of history of what happened from the townsfolk and gossip. But who can draw fact from fancy and I have no way of knowing the future. - I'll draw my own conclusions. Just tell me what you know. [ominous music] - Time back in the 1800s there was a girl named Sarah Martin who was staying here with her husband while he was shoeing horses. And she murdered him one night in that very room with a knife they never found. They dragged her before a firing squad after she'd had her baby at the stockade. And to the end she swore that she had been possessed by an evil spirit in a mirror. There were others before. And others later. I told you, some months after I'd bought the in, a woman, Elizabeth Raymond, who killed her husband in that very room. After that I locked it up for good. - My wife's real name is Katherine Raymond. - Elizabeth Raymond's daughter. Well, now mind you she'll have no choice but to kill you. - [Eric] What? - But can't you see? It won't be your wife, she can't, she can't fight the vengeful spirit that's possessing her soul. Now of all things, that you've got to believe. - Wait, wait, wait, just tell me the rest of Megan's story. Why did she kill John Eisley? - What Earthly good would that do? You can't fight her spirit. - [sighs] I can try. But I can't do it without your help. - Alright. Alright. Megan was a beauty, as you know. But she loved no man beyond his purse. And she had a burning desire to be something better than a common barmaid. She yearned for respectability. And to that end she chose Lieutenant John Eisley of the colonial horse guard, a blue blood if ever there was one, for a husband. - [Eric] The name on the bed. - Eisley bedded her each time his troop rolled into Unionville. He thought of her only as his paid whore. But this handsome lieutenant was all Megan longed for. She tried everything to get him to treat her as a lady. His nobility, wealth and position beguiled her. She gave him gifts bought from her meager savings, presents that would win his heart. Or so she hoped. And night after night she gave him her heart and soul. With unbridled passion. And then came the fateful night of the Governor's Ball. Megan had spent all her bed money on an extravagant gown, determined to have Eisley invite her to the galla affair. Wanting only to have his way with her, Eisley lied, promising to be her escort, but he had no intention of making good his pledge. That night at the ball, a glittering affair for the rich, Megan came alone, determined to make Eisley love her, to prove to him that she was as worthy as the gentry he so favored. And he was dazzled by her beauty indeed. [bright music] And as they danced, Megan thought she saw true love in her lieutenant's eyes. But, poor deluded girl, it was only lust. After the ball Eisley was feverish to have her, but Megan put him off, for she had the sweetest of secrets to share with him. Surely he would love her now. Her dreams, her ambitions would be realized and so she told him her special secret. She was carrying his child. They would have to marry. She thought it was wonderful news. She would be his wife, they would start a family. But Eisley would have none of it. He scorned her with his laughter. He would never take a lowly barmaid as his bride, never. Hiding her despair and rage from her callous lover, Megan took her revenge. [dark music] She never would tell them where the murder weapon was. They hanged her, unrepentant, 10 days after the birth of her babe. - Then all her heirs were pregnant when they killed their husbands? - Yes, I guess that's the truth of it. - My wife is pregnant. - As it seems that no man married to one of Megan's descendants, ever lived to see the child born, you have no choice but to leave her. - I can't, I love her, I can't leave her. - It's not a matter of love, it's a matter of life and death. Yours and your wife's. She'll kill you as sure as the sun rises. And they'll hang her after she gives birth. The cycle goes on. You can't break it, man. - Then I will just have to change history. - Your wife came in Mr. Beckett. - Thanks for telling me Thomas. Karen. [moaning] - Thank you. - Thank you so much I hope you have a pleasant evening. Yes, can I help you? - I think so, yes. [knocking at door] - Hold your horses, I'm coming. - [Man] Delivery. [knocking at door] - Coming. - Hi, your dress. - Oh. You get enough of an eyeful? Oh yes. Oh yes. Look at you. - My lady, you look smashing. - Thank you sir. - You're welcome madam. - Can't you tell us anything? - Trust me. Please. - Mr. Beckett. - We'll wait for you outside, Eric. - What you're doing is madness. - I have no other choice. I love her. - To try to change history could mean your death. - It's my only hope. [unsettling music] - Now that's my Katherine. You're more like me than any of them. [happy dance music] - Well, you don't have to stand in the hall. A gentleman removes his weapons in a lady's room. - I wanna make love to you. - Oh I know you do. And we will. But first I have a secret. - I know what it is. - No you just think you do. This is a secret secret. [foreboding music] - Karen, you have to believe that I love you very much. - Do you really? - More than life itself. - I carry your child. - I know and I want a baby very much. - No, you don't love me or the baby. - Oh yes I do. I love you and our child. - No, this isn't the way it's supposed to be. - He's lying to ya Katherine. - You're lying to me. - No, no I'm telling the truth. - Look into his eyes. Can't you see the deceit. He doesn't care about you. Come on girl, you know what you have to do. - Don't listen to her. Don't. Ow! Karen you've got to trust me. I want you to have our baby. That's the truth from the bottom of my heart. [groans] - Do it now Katherine. - Karen you've got your chance. Come on, fight her. Karen I love you. - [Megan] Be done with it girl. - Karen, fight her! - Do it now Katherine. Do it or he'll betray you. Kill him! Kill him now. - [Eric] Karen don't listen to her. - [Megan] Kill him! - Karen! Karen look at me. Karen. - Do it now! - Karen. - Kill him. - Karen. - He doesn't love you. - Look, you know who I am. You know I'd give my life for you. - Kill him Katherine. - Trust me. - [Megan] He doesn't deserve to live. [yelling] - [Megan] Katherine! [screaming] - It's over. You did it. Look, it's okay. Look. - Well sweetie, some vacation, huh? [Rita laughs] Ah Thomas, thank you very much. This is for you. - Sir. - Thank you. Hey buddy. - [Mr. MacVey] Look after the keys Thomas. - Goodbye Mr. MacVey. - Goodbye Mrs. Beckett. [happy music] - Are you okay? - I'm better than okay. [sensual music]
