- Hi. I didn't mean to scare you. I brought you some hand towels. They were the last ones. I saved them for you. - How did you like it? - It was okay. - You can keep it overnight. Most people do. It's only partially wound. Did it bore you? - No. - Then what's the problem? - There isn't a problem. - You always bring them back like this. I mean, I can usually figure people out. I try to build up a character profile watching what customers take out. The thing about you is, There's no consistenc y. I mean, look at these titles. You got horror, drama, comedy. Even a bit of porn. And you've taken most of these out at least... 20 times. - This is my lover. - Yeah? - He's an actor. That's the list of movies he's been in. I like to watch his scenes. - So he's your... - he's my lover. I'm in love. - What about him? - You don't believe me. - I didn't say that. - We work at the same place, a hotel. That's his day job. - And he does his acting at night? - And days off. Sometimes he calls in sick. - He sounds dedicated. - He is. - But he's just a extra. - What do you mean? - Well, he may be in these movies but he doesn't have a speaking part. He doesn't talk in them. - He's on screen. There is nothing special about words. - And then, there are those who complain that you're not vocal enough. I'm not talking about noises here or anything crude. It's just that some people thrive on compliments. And ultimately, that's what we're all here to do. Compliment our guests while they stay with us. Good. Now, I have a friend coming in at two. - A good friend? - Oh, I think you'll find this friend very good. - All right. - How are things with Lisa? - Fine. - Is she still bothering you? - Not really. - I could have her let go. Find some excuse. - It's not worth it. - It's not difficult to make each other's lives more complicated, Clara. - That's not what I'm saying. - That's what you're doing. - They've already started casting. - Nothing's been finalized. You can make any suggestions you want. We're here to complement each other's efforts. That's why I sent you up there. To become more involved, to help. - How? - Any way you want. If there's a location you see, If there's someone you want to audition, feel free. We're all working together on this. Okay? Good. So, how do you like the hotel? - It's fine. - Didn't I tell you? It's very special. So intimate. - This one gets taken out a lot. - Is it any good? - I wouldn't be able to tell you. - Why not? - I never watch these things. - Then how do you know what to recommend? - Well, I don't. People check out the covers and take what they want. - Do you like working here? - Not this part. - What other part is there? - Well, we rent equipment out. - What for? - People want things recorded. Parties, weddings. The usual. And the not-So-Usual. Sometimes, I do it for them. - Is this how you usually get auditions? Slipping your picture under some stranger's door? - Well, I don't have an agent. - Well then, how did you get in touch? - I work at the hotel, part-time, as a consultant. - What do you do? - I help to book entertainment. - So how do you know who I am? - Well, I don't... exactly. I mean, I know you're involved with movies. I get a list of names of people in the entertainment field Who are staying at the hotel. But I don't know exactly what it is that you do. - I could be a secretary. - Then why would you be doing this? - I could think of reasons. Well, I'm not a secretary. - That's good. - So, let's start. I'll read with you. If you could just look into the camera. - Sure. - How do you know what to film? - You don't. You just go in there with your camera and get whatever you can. - What's happening here? - Oh. I usually try to find a room Where I can take people and get them to talk. This is the bride's dad. Everyone's having a great time. - Thank you. - Is she your only daughter? You've enjoyed a lot of applause in your career. But something extraordinarily dramatic is happening to you today. Can you give us any indication - And I know this is not the best time to ask - Of what's going through your mind? This must be a very happy day for you. I can honestly say that this is the best wedding I've ever taped. - Is that true? - Of course not. You've seen one, you've seen them all. - There's nothing to be scared of. You've done this sort of operation before. - I couldn't forgive myself if anything happened to you. - Why should anything go wrong? - The doctor said... - there's a risk, that's all. And it's a risk I have to take. You're my sister. I'm not gonna watch you die. Okay? - Yes. - How was it? - Fine. - Do you want me to read it again? - All right. - I have a question. - Yes. - Do I find out that you're dying in the scene? - What? - Is this the scene where I find out that you're dying? - No. No. You've found that out before. - I'd... do anything in the world to make her happy. - Well, I think you have. - Thank you. - And now, she's leaving the nest, About to embark in a new life. And let me tell you, she'll never forget this. - That's amazing. - What? - That you got him to do that. - It's not too difficult. Just got to know what buttons to push. - You don't have to say a word. It's good to see you. Is that any better? I can try it again. - What do you think of the script? - I like it. - Really? - Sure. I mean, it's a bit... - yes? - Well, I had a little difficulty... - believing it. - Hmm. - It's all true. - Please, eddy. - Look, it's not that eas y. - I'll just watch. You don't have to pay me or anything. I'll help you move stuff around. - But you just said you wanted to interview people. - If you think I can. I mean, I'll do whatever you want me to. - Let me think about it. - Please? - I don't know if I should ask this, but do you think I might have a chance? - It's not up to me. - Would this be your first speaking part? - On film? Yeah. I mean, I've done some theatre. Nothing too big. - So, what do you do? - Like I said, I work at the hotel. - Part-time? - No. - Full-time? - Yeah. - As an entertainment consultant. - I work in housekeeping. - I was cleaning your room and I saw the script. - So you took a chance. - Yeah. - Do you do that often? - What? - Take... chances? - Sometimes. - When they're interesting... - Lance! Lance! Lance! Lance! - Clara? Clara! - I wouldn't say everyone. And what time, do you think, you would be available, For instance, from 3 o'clock until... - until 3:40. - You think so? - Yes. Definitely. - You're very late, Lance. - I'm sorry. We thought you might have deserted us - I wouldn't do that. - I would like to think That this is an ideal working environment for you. - It is. - Good. How did you like my friend in 106? Hmm, the feeling was mutual. I've circled in another appointment for this afternoon. - What time? - During your work hours. Why? - It's just that... I might have to leave a bit early. - I'm sure we can be flexible. My friend was very taken with you. - All right. - Do be careful, though. - What do you mean? - This friend was quite smitten. Remember what I told you about distance. Cool mind. Cool heart. Very playful body. - This is not an everyday sort of a situation, Julie. You could be dying. Besides, your fear isn't justified. I've talked to the doctor. There's nothing to be scared of. They've done this sort of operation before. It's a matter of my feeling to you. You can't expect me not to react to this In what would normally be considered an extreme... - You're sure? - Yes. - He's what you're looking for? - Exactly. - You could be dying. - You find him natural enough? - Besides, your fear isn't justified. - Well, let's think about it. We have a few more days. - He's my choice. - And I respect that. Now, did you get my revisions? - Yes. - And how did you feel about them? - They're unacceptable. I hate the idea of putting in a talk show. It doesn't add anything. - Well, it's a unique way of getting the information across. Nothing is more boring than people in a doctor's office Discussing the disease of the week. - But it cheapens the point. - What point? This isn't one of your university lectures, Clara. You're not in a classroom anymore. We're not presenting a thesis. We're telling a story. - My story. - Look. This isn't the time to argue. - When is? - When I'm less bus y. - You're never less bus y. - I can't talk like this. - All right. I'll come there. - Hi. - Where are you going? - I have to go back. - Why? - Complications. I'm sorry I had to leave so early this morning. - It's okay. Are you returning? - I'm not sure. - Do we stay in touch? - Over what? - Us. - We can still see each other. How? - Lance... what's going on? I know how upset you get. You're very special. You can't let other people make you feel small. Let me love you. - You see, there's a side of me That sees you all as children. My children. Now, I don't mean that in a negative way. I am concerned about your well-being. And making this as comfortable a working environment as possible. If you accept this notion, Then it's not too difficult to understand Why I would have favourites. And some children are naturally more lovable. Others... Well, others have to work harder At gaining the attention they feel they deserve. Does that answer your question? - Is Eddy here? - No. - Where is he? - Shooting a party. - Where is the party? - Why? - He wanted me to help him. - To help him do what? - Help him tape it. - Yeah? - Is Eddy here? - Who? - Eddy. I think he's taping the party. - Hello. - Hi. - How are you? - Fine. - I hope this isn't too strange for you. - No. Did you have a good trip? - Fine. - When did you get in? - A couple of hours ago. - I missed you. - Really? - Yeah. - I watched your audition again today. - And? - It's very good. - What are you doing here? - I came to see if you needed any help. - No. - Eddy, why are you doing this? - Because it's part of my job. - But it... - Look. We'll talk about this later. Come by the store tomorrow. Okay? - Hi there. - Hello. - How was your day? - All right. - What happened? - Not much. How are things in your end? - Not too good. - Housekeeping. Housekeeping. Your ordered some extra towels. I'm just going to leave them on the counter. - I'm... not the casting director. - What do you mean? - I'm the writer. I was told I'd have input over casting. That's why I auditioned you. They liked your audition, by the way. You might have the part. You won't find out for a couple of days, But you could find out sooner, if you want. - How? - The producer's assistant is staying in the room next to mine. That's where all the casting information is kept. You can sneak in there tomorrow night. - Sneak in? - One of the... producer's friends is getting married. Everyone will be at the wedding. - Are you sure? - Positive. When you're inside the room, I want you to do me a favour. I want you to find me a copy of the revised script. It'll be printed on pink paper. Is that clear? - Don't you have a copy? - Why would I? - Well, if you're the writer... What's so funny? - I'm only the writer. - Is that clear? - Yes. - You sure you know what you're doing? - I just want an interview with the bride. That's all. Nothing fancy. Just get a sense of her excitement. Okay? - Yes. - I'm trusting you here. These are very important people. - How did you get the job? - I was personally recommended. - Excuse me. - Yes? - Are you related to the bride? - Not... this time. - Hello, everyone. I'm... very sorry I couldn't be there To share this special evening with you. That's her. And that's the groom. - Most of us gathered here tonight Are in the profession of making fairy tales. But sometimes, these dreams come true. And that's certainly the case When two people, as special as Ronny and Trish, get married. - And then, I saw her in this little bikini and... you remember? - Ron... I'm wondering if it might be possible to have a few moments... alone with Trish? - What for? - I'd just like to ask her some questions. - About me? - Would that be okay? - I guess so. - This is not an everyday sort of a situation, julie. You could be dying. Besides, your fear isn't justified. I've talked to the doctor. There's nothing... - Congratulations. - They've done this sort of operation before. - Are you sure that's what it means? - Does it say "final choices" on the tape? - Yes. - Then that's what they are. ...and it's a risk I have to take. You're my sister. I am not going to watch you die. Okay? - Yes. - Did you find a copy of the script? - Here. - Turn to page 73. Read me what it says. - Are you ready? - I think so. - What do you see in Ronny? - What? - What do you see in Ronny? When you look at him, What are you looking at? - Him. - Did it come easy? - What? - His love? - I'm not quite sure if I get what... - have there been times where it didn't seem so... certain? - No. L... - I mean, these things are pretty delicate, aren't they? There is no telling what could happen. One of you begins to have second thoughts and... the whole thing can crumble away. And then what? - Scene 87. A large television studio. The audience at the tv talk-back show are excited about today's program. The subject is organ transplants. And as the camera... what's the matter? - That's not what I wrote. - What do you mean? - They've changed my script. - Can't you complain? - They'll fire me. - Maybe if you talked to... - I've been trying to. That's why I came here. He won't even see me. - I'm sorry. I wish I could do something. - You can. - Why would you ask me that? - Why not? - I don't even know you. - It's just that this sort of questions interest me. I mean, love is about... feeling someone else feeling you, right? But sometimes, you can feel someone else And you can feel them feeling you, But they may not act that way. In your case, it's the other way around. He says that he loves you, which is great. But I'm not sure if that matters. The question is, Do you feel him feeling you The way you feel yourself? - Why should I even think about it? - Because years from now, when you look back at this tape, Your answer might be really... interesting. Hey! Hey, come back! - This script is very important. - You said before it was based on a true story. - It happened to me... and my brother. - So what can I do? - They'll cast you. And... you'll meet the producer. He won't listen to me; he might listen to you. - Why? - Because you're an actor. You can suggest things you think your character might do. - And if he doesn't listen? - You can threaten to leave. - But I'm nothing to them, Clara. - Not until they start shooting. But then, you're worth a lot. I mean... they can't cut you out. And they can't start shooting everything over with someone else. Do you understand? - I hope you can explain. Why is my wife in tears? - I'm sorry. I did not talk to your wife. I did not tape your wife. I am sorry. I know nothing about this. - Look, I wanna know one thing. - Hey look. This had nothing to do with me. She taped her! - Where is it? - What? - The tape! - Will you do it? - I suppose so. - You don't seem very enthusiastic. - It's just that... - yes? - This is a big chance for me. - And you don't want to screw it up. - Yeah... - doesn't what I'm going through mean anything to you? Do I have to beg? - No. - You like that? - No! - What? - No! - Don't do it to other people! - This is going to end pretty soon. - What? - The line. I only booked half-an-hour. - you have my number. Call me anytime. - Okay... - what are you thinking? - Nothing. Why should anything go wrong? - The doctor said... - there's a risk, that's all. And it's a risk I have to take. You're my sister. I'm not going to let you die. - And Lance... - Yes? - Congratulations. You must be very excited. - Yes, I am. - You okay? Look... I'm sorry about pointing the finger at you. You see what I mean about it being a bit tricky? - I lost my objectivity. - Well, that can happen. - It doesn't happen to you. - Maybe it should. Look. I gotta get back. Can you get home okay? - You don't want me around. - I don't think it would be such a great idea. I'll see you at the shop. Tomorrow. Okay? - You're probably wondering how you got the part. - Well, uh... - Lance, I'd like you to meet Ronny. You might notice that you look like Ronny. That's because you'll be playing his brother. He's the guy you give your lung to. - I'm not sure I understand. - The transplant. You've read the script. You give your lung to Ronny. - But I thought I gave it to my sister. - There's been a change. - Please sit down, Lisa. We've had a suicide in room 106. Were you aware of the person staying in that room? Did you have any... contact with him? - Well, if you don't have any questions, Lance, I suppose we can think of signing this. - Shouldn't I have someone look it over? - I thought you didn't have an agent. - I have a friend. A lawyer. I mean, if that's okay with you. - Sure, it's okay with me. As long as there aren't any problems. - I'm sure there won't be any. - When do you think we might have this settled? - I'm meeting my friend tomorrow. - Wednesday morning then. - Yeah. That should be fine. - I'll probably be out of town but we can meet by conference upstairs Trish will tell you about it. - You must be busy. - Ah! I'm shooting three of these suckers right now. But this one is very special to me. - Do you know if any of our staff had any contact with the guest? - I don't think so. - Did you see anyone going into the room? Coming out? - I don't think so. - You're sure? You said before that you heard someone crying When you delivered the towels. - Yes. - You don't think that they may have been crying over... someone like Lance? - No. - And you're positive about that? Did Lance ever talk to you About receiving any gifts from our guests? - Housekeeping staff do not receive gratuities. - Lance? How are you feeling? I heard you were sick. I was... just about to watch one of your movies. I was wondering if you wanted to drop by. I know you don't think they're anything special, But I do. Lance... something terrible happened to me today. I could have saved someone's life But I ignored him instead. Has that ever happened to you? Lance? ... - that's impossible. - It's true. I could read it to you. - You donate your lung to your brother. - Yes. - But that's not what happened. - I know. - Did you ask him why? - I... didn't have a chance. - So what happens to the sister? - She's not in the script. - They cut me out. You have to ask him why. - Why can't you? - I'm about to be fired. Look... you have to tell him that you need a sister. I mean... the part only makes sense if you have a sister. And if you donate your lung to your... - you have to do something. - I will. Look, it's going to be difficult To keep coming here to see you. - You have my phone number. - Yes. I'll call you. - Promise? - Yes. - You can't ask me not to worry. - No. But I can ask you to stay calm. - If they do any sort of investigation, they'll know I was here. - Of course you were here. You're the maid. - Lance? What's happening? - We're having a talk. - About what? - I can't tell you. - Why not? - Because she wants to keep it a secret. - What's going on? Answer me! - She can't hear you, Lisa. - Can she hear you? - Then ask her. Lance... Lance... do you need any help? How do I get there? Lance? - Can we move the monitor a little to the left, please. Thanks. Great. Thanks very much. - Two things. - Yeah. - First of all, I want a hotel room For the entire length of the shooting. - Why? - I won't be able to concentrate on the role if I stay at home. - Okay. I'll buy that. What's the second point? - I don't think my character should donate the lung to his brother. - No? - No. I think it was better... when it was his sister. Like in the first draft. And I also don't like the idea of the tv talk show at the end. - You don't. - No. I think it was better the way it was. - And... why is that? - It seemed to be more authentic. - Authentic... to what? - To the integrity of the story. - Can you be more specific? - I think the author's point has been cheapened. - Do you know who I am? - Yes. - Do you have any idea Of the sort of background I bring to a project like this? - Yeah. - You probably used to watch some of my shows When you were a kid, right? Did you watch television when you were a kid? - Yes. - Then you used to watch some of my shows. - So what's your point? - My point is, who the fuck do you think you are? - All I'm suggesting... - you've been talking to Clara, haven't you? Look. I just want to make sure That we're working with the best script possible. Do you understand? - But it's a personal story. - Of course it is. It's a very personal story And I respect that. I just want to make sure that it works as a story. That's my job. I'm giving a lot to this show. I'm directing it. I'm even gonna act in it. I know it was a traumatic event for Clara. She was close to her brother. A man gives up a lung to save his sister's life. This is an extraordinary event, isn't it? - And he dies as a result. This moves me, Lance. This moves me so much, I want to make it into a very fine film. Something I can share with millions of people. - Her brother actually died? - She didn't tell you. Tragic. Clara's script deals with what she went through. But that wasn't what interested me. So I optioned her story and made it mine. And a movie that takes the form of a talk show Is very original, Lance. I'd watch it. And people have always watched what I'd like to watch. You have, ever since you were a kid. Right? So are you ready to sign the contract now or not? Okay. Then sign it. Good. I'll see you on set. Hi. Lance isn't in right now. Please leave a message. Hi. I... just watched your audition again today. I'm... I'm dying to see you in the film. Lance... why... why aren't you returning my messages? I have to know what he said. Do you... do you care about me at all? Do you... do you know what I'm going through? - You haven't been getting enough sleep. - The tape is different. - What do you mean? - The tape is different. - All right. Calm down. I'll have a look at it. - Eddy... I saw things. Things I hadn't seen before. - What? Other meanings? - Yes. - I guess that's normal. - And other scenes. - That's not possible. Listen. I think it'd be a good idea if you cooled off these tapes for awhile. Get some sleep. - He's suffering, eddy. - Who? - Lance! - Lisa... get some sleep. - Now, what I want you to do is pretend that this is a real show. As if it were being broadcast live, And you are actual participants. Now, the topic of the show is organ transplants. And this is a life and death issue. Obviously, I need the tension level here to be quite high. A number of you sitting in the front rows Have been told that you have relatives or children who are in need of donors. And the actors sitting up here Are doctors who specialize in the type of operations That could save the lives of your loved ones. I'd like to take a moment here To introduce Lance. Lance will be playing the brother of David, The man we're watching on the live feed from the hospital. Can we see the live-Feed image for a moment? Can you hear me there, ron? Ron? It's obvious that David isn't the only person in this country Suffering from this disease. But he is certainly the only one lucky enough to be on national television. And then, I suppose the question becomes, Who gets on tv to ask for a body organ? Who decides? Dr. Spencer, Is there something you want to say about this? - Well... the main problem is getting access to the donors. The public doesn't seem to be aware Of the desperate need for organs. - Okay. Okay. But let's take the case of David. How often does a lung become available - Not too often. That's because In a trauma such as, say, a car accident, A lung is one of the first things to get damaged. - Let's talk to David's parents. Can we move the camera Out into the hallway? Go into the hall and chat there, for a second. If you've just joined us, David is a young man desperately in need of an organ transplant. I don't mean to make your lives Anymore complicated than they are right now, but... something extraordinarily dramatic Is happening to you today. Can you give us any indication - And I know this isn't the best time to ask - Of what's going through your mind? Can we see David again? Would the camera person there go in the room again just one more time? However traumatic this may be, Even for those of you in the comfort of your homes, I want you to meet David. David doesn't want any special attention. He just wants a chance to have his story told. - Excuse me. - Yes. Who are you? - I'm... David's brother. - David's brother? - Yes. - Is this man your son? - I want to make a donation. No!!!
