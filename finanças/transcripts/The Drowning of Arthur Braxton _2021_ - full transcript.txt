[♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [Sniffles] [Whimpering] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [Beeping] [Bell ringing] ARTHUR (VO): I just try to get through my day drawing as little attention as possible. Twatston! ARTHUR (VO): That's Tommy Clarke. He's basically one theft and a public wank away from an ASBO. [Indistinct chatter in distant] [♪♪♪] [Thuds] [Cheering] [Chuckles] Finally we can be together. Arthur... ...do you know? Can you repeat the question? Do you know who Apollo and Daphne were? He doesn't know. Why is he even pretending look? I don't know. No. ARTHUR (VO): Tommy's whole thing, his view on life or whatever, is that he can only be happy if everyone else is miserable. TEACHER: Right. ARTHUR (VO): So today... ...he's living the dream. [Bell rings] Arthur! Arthur, wait! You're so hot Arthur. ARTHUR (VO): This is Estelle Jarvis. [Grunting] When I was nine... I want you Arthur Braxton. ARTHUR (VO): I gave her a curly wurly and my heart. [Breathing heavily] She just laughed at me. Wooh! And she kept the curly wurly. [Laughter] Whoever said school days were the best days of your life, well... ...they were talking utter bollocks. [Panting] Sorry. I... Sorry. [Door creaking] [Music playing in the television] [Sighs] [Sighs] [Beeping] [Ding] ARTHUR (VO): So, this is my Dad. It's not much like having a dad really... Got the bugger. I'm not hungry. ARTHUR (VO): ...it's more like having a house plant. Come on. Come on I made this for you, can you just eat it? Come on eat the soup Dad. I said I'm not hungry. Hey! Gimme the bottle! Get off of me! [Grunting] [Taking deep breaths] My house. My bloody rules. I don't need you. You and the bloody mess you make. Yeh that's right, run off. Just like your mum. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] ARTHUR (VO): It's weird. We always think life is safe, yet the only thing standing between me and my impending death is a metal fence. [♪♪♪] [Taking deep breaths] Investigations into the disappearance of a boy from Winsdale continue, with overnight searches throughout the town. ESTELLE (VO): You're so hot Arthur. TV HOST 1: His parents are desperately seeking information and have set up a special number which is on screen now. TOMMY (VO): Twatston! ESTELLE (VO): I want you, Arthur Braxton. [♪♪♪] ARTHUR (VO): And that's when I heard music. This is the music that saved my life. I swear the music's talking to me. [Taking deep breaths] Like, it's proper talking to me. Okay, okay. ARTHUR (VO): Like it wants me to be near it. It's like the music gets me. Like I need it and it needs me. Like everything I am, everything I'll be is because of the music. ♪ Weak are the ones ♪ ♪ Who can't see you as I ♪ Hello? [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Hello?

He literally put my arse on a noticeboard. You are not to tell anyone. No-one. Who would I tell miss? [Laughing] Alright, that's enough. - Miss. - Mm hmm? [Munching] You know that big bath house place in town they're knocking down? The Oracle? Yeah, is that what it's called? Mm hmm. Do people still use it? Why? Well, I just saw it the other day, just never really noticed it before. Well no, it's empty. I'm glad they're knocking it down. People used to say, 'It's a good place to disappear'. - WORKER 1: Night guys. - Yeh goodnight, take care. Bye. WORKER 2: Shorten the legs and put it in so that the tailgate shuts.

[Grunting] [Taking deep breaths] Hello, Arthur Braxton. Why does everybody know my name? I knew you'd come here soon. Uh, you've not got any clothes on. Silver said you'd be here eventually. Why haven't you got any clothes on? What? I knew this one boy at my school called Greg and he was caught spying on the girls in the changing rooms and one of the teachers caught him and they expelled him and then his parents found out and they moved him away and I've not even seen him since. Arthur. Sorry! Sorry. It's just a shell. ARTHUR: What? That's what Silver says. It's just a shell. Who's Silver? He's kind of like my dad, I guess. Why did that girl push me into the water? Okay. [Chuckles] Yeah, that's Laurel, she does that. Right. Good. Okay. [Taking deep breaths] I'm officially confused. Arthur. Come here. Closer. [♪♪♪] You're Arthur Braxton. I'm Delphina. I've been waiting for you to come for so long. Would you like to come and swim with me? [Beeping] Uhh, sorry, I have to go, it's my dad. No you can't! Thanks a lot for, uh, getting my tie and stuff and... saving me. Alright, have a nice rest of your swim. Okay, bye! Please come back! It gets quiet here. I'm home Dad. Dad? What's the matter with you? There's no TV! Cause somebody didn't pay the bills, did they? Arthur Braxton... Senior. Uhm. Arthur Braxton Senior. [Clears throat] Uhm, no, gimme one second. Yeh, gimme one second. Uhm. No. [♪♪♪] [Indistinct chatter in distant] He's coming, he's coming! [Indistinct chatter in distant] Right. Shut up everyone. Now, we have a lot to get through today because clearly, if the homework was any indication, none of you are passing. And some of you... ...didn't even bother. Right, we're gonna start you off with a big one. [Chuckles] Shut up Cliff. Sorry sir. It's just such a big problem. [Laughing] Yes well, I'll give you five minutes to try and work out what we need to insert here. Clifford! Quiet! Look, I know maths is boring but can we please try and keep our eyes here. Exams are coming up and we need to crack this. [Laughter] MR. WORRELL: Qui... Quiet! [Laughter] Oh for God's sake. [Laughter] [Laughing] Twatston, Twatston! - Twatston, Twatston! - Twatston, Twatston! - Twatston, Twatston! - Twatston, Twatston! - Twatston, Twatston! - Twatston, Twatston! - Twatston, Twatston! - Twatston, Twatston! - Twatston, Twatston! - Twatston, Twatston! [Laughing] Who did this? WORRELL: Is this yours? - Well, technically... - MR. WORRELL: Get out! [Bell rings] TOMMY: You should come though. - It'll be good. - Maybe. It'd be nice. I think we'd make a good pair. Me with my whisky and you with- whatever you drink. Cherry Bomb. What's Cherry Bomb? It's like that cherry vodka. Oh right. That's girly. Well I am a girl, Tommy. You're a woman. In a good way. Okay. So you gonna come or? I dunno. Maybe. That was really confusing. - Is she coming? - Yeah! Yeh probably. [Arthur chuckles] - TOMMY: What? - What? - TOMMY: You laughing at me? - No, I... Cause no one laughs at Tommy Clarke. I... I wasn't laughing... It looked like you were laughing. Didn't it look like he was laughing, Cliff? Cliff? Huh? Didn't it look like he was laughing at me? Oh, I dunno Tommy. I was reading about the auditions. They're doing 'Cats'. I always wanted to be in Cats. I think you need to be taught a lesson, Twatston. I didn't laugh... I didn't even know what he's saying. You should show him who's boss, Tommy. Yeh. After school. Today. Okay yeh. After school. As soon as that bell rings, I will see you outside. [Taking deep breaths] [Grunts] Do you reckon I should do Memories? I don't care, Cliff. Yeah. Yeah, I'll do Memories. Don't touch. It's drying. [♪♪♪] Drying. [♪♪♪] Arthur. Everything is wet. Please sit down. Miss? Are you ever going to finish your marking? What's going on Arthur? I have got to... ...take my... I've got to take my dad to the doctors. This afternoon. Right? Well I've got... art with you at the end of the day. So... ...could I take it off? How is he? Yeah, just eh... fine, it's just like... doctors. Okay. You can skip my lesson. But you'll make it up over some lunches. - Thanks Miss. - What's it for? It is for... To get him some more pills. Why doesn't he just have a repeat prescription? Hm? Well that's just what they've said to me so I've just gotta do it you know. They working? He's not drunk when I wake up anymore, so. And you're still getting help? Yeah, yeah. No it's um... [Blows raspberry] [Chuckles] Not just the two of us. That would be uh... that'd be ridiculous. ARTHUR (VO): Lying to Mrs. New wood felt like lying to your gran or something. Felt dirty, but it's better than getting beaten u... See you after lesson, Twatston. ARTHUR (VO): I swear this place is like a magnet. And I'm a twatting paperclip. Get a move on. - WORKER 3: It's too heavy. - WORKER 2: Too heavy? WORKER 2: Well put your hands on it then. Well it's alright for you, you're only carrying a cable. You know why I'm carrying a cable? Why? Because you do what I say and I do what I like. Use your brain would ya. [♪♪♪] Hey. You're Laurel, right? Wait. Hold on. [Panting] Wait. [♪♪♪] [Panting] Wait! Stop! Hello? Look can you stop doing this. It's creepy. [♪♪♪] We've been waiting for you, Arthur Braxton. Waiting for me to do what? Whose is this? Silver. The girl in the pool said he's her dad? You have to help us, Arthur. Help you do what? [♪♪♪] It's just names... Great. All right then. Yup. Very helpful. Thank you very much. SILVER: I told you not to speak to him! DELPHINA: I just want her to grow up normal. SILVER: And a fine start you gave her! He was here to soon! But I've been here forever Silver! My whole world has been The Oracle. SILVER: It still is. DELPHINA: I just want to talk to him. I just want to see him- SILVER: The folks who come here don't leave, Delphina, you know that. He's here for me, for my work. I loved him the moment I saw him Silver. SILVER: What do you know about love? Hm? You've never even seen a lad before. DELPHINA: I can feel it! In here! SILVER: If you want someone to talk to, I'll send you down there. It's where you'll end up anyway. ARTHUR: I don't think he likes me much. He's just protecting me. It's weird, he used to be so sweet and teach me things but now he's just angry. Yeh, I know what that's like. - What made you... - Did you mean... Sorry. What made you come back? Dunno. Mrs New wood said it was a good place to disappear. Why would you want to disappear? I don't think many people would care. I'd care! You don't know Tommy Clarke do you? Who's that? He's just a boy at my school. Like a fish? No. Girls don't normally talk to me. Not the way that you do. Well... Did you mean what you said to... Okay. What's it like to sleep in a bed? You're joking right? Silver always says he's going to bed, but I don't know what that's like. So where do you sleep? Just, down here. You're mad. It's warm. Bed's warm. That sounds amazing. I'd love to sleep with you. Do people do that? Uhm. Yeh I suppose, if they're in love. Did you mean what you said to Silver? Yeh, I meant it. I don't reckon I know much about love. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Where were you? Yeah! Too scared or something? Big scaredy cat Braxton? We got all the year elevens waiting- Scaredy Catston. [Chuckles] - What? - Eh? What are you doing? Well it's like scaredy cat but I sort of mixed it with Braxton. Catston. Look, no one embarrasses Tommy Clarke! I wasn't embarrassed. I was angry. I was really, really angry. No, I'm pretty sure you were embarrassed. Cause I even said to you at the time, I said, 'This is embarrassing'. No, it was anger. I think you just mistook it for something different. CLIFF: No, that's what I said. It was embarrassing. Just shut up, Cliff. Twatston. I'm going to fight you at lunch. And I'm gonna show everyone how pathetic you are. I need to go home, I think. I'm, I'm ill. You feel fine. No, I mean it's pretty bad. I was in the toilet and I was being sick. It was pretty major. Just give that a second. [Choking] [Beeping] Hmm. Nothing out of the ordinary. Maybe it's broken? No. I think we've just got a case of the man flu. Can I go home? Well, how about this. I'll ring home and see what they think? And if they think that's best, then your dad can come and get you. [Beeping] [Grunts] [Bell rings] - Fight, fight, fight! - Fight, fight, fight! - Fight, fight, fight! - Fight, fight, fight! - Fight, fight, fight! - Fight, fight, fight! - Fight, fight, fight! - Fight, fight, fight! - Fight, fight, fight! - Fight, fight, fight! Delphina, are you ever going to get out the water? You're scared of it aren't you? Get in, Arthur. Nah. I... I mean I never learned. - To swim? - Yeah. Never really got the chance. It's easy, I can teach you. - Well why don't you come out? - No Arthur, let go. - Sorry. - I can't. ARTHUR: I wish the kids at school could see you. No one can know I'm here. So many rules! No one can know you're here. Can't come out the water... Promise. Please. Okay. I promise. Cross your heart. Cross my heart. Hope to die. I'll come out a bit. For you. [Exhales] There. Happy?

Funding cuts have hit the force hard in recent months, TOMMY: Quick, quick, quick. Come on Cliff, he's coming. Come on Cliff! I said run! Tell your friends to bugger off. - They're gone, Dad. - TOMMY: Twatston! SILVER: Go away for a bit. DELPHINA: Silver, she wouldn't want you to. SILVER: I need the water. Come on. No. SILVER: Come on! KID: Please! Please! Please let me go! Please let me go! SILVER: Water goddesses! [Crying] No no, I don't wanna... No! [Crying] SILVER: One left lass. Where were you yesterday?

This thing we do, this is built on you not lying to me. Okay? - Okay? - Sorry, Miss. Tommy Clarke wants to beat me up. Why? I dunno. Well what should I do? I'm gonna have a word with him. No miss, please sit down, you're gonna make it worse. Arthur, what do you think he's gonna do to you? Miss please, you don't know what you're talking about. Just sit down. Let me speak to him. Miss please can you just sit down alright? You don't know him, I do, okay? He... he doesn't leave things at the school gate. I'm going to talk to him. Miss, what's your grand plan okay? What have you got to offer? You're gonna go out there and you're gonna say, 'oh look, Twatston said that you're gonna be bullying him.' How do you think that's gonna fly with him? ...He's gonna come over... - I cannot ignore this Arthur. The last time I ignored something like this a girl in my class... Look okay I could die! I have to come to this stupid school every single day! And there's nothing for me ok, there's nothing. I have to come here over and over again. Everyday. And we just sit here, talking. You're make... You're making me sandwiches. I... Do something! Do something. [Taking deep breaths] ARTHUR'S DAD: Arthur! - Arthur! - [♪♪♪] These are for me? Get out and try some on. I'll just take one.

I can't tie him up. There wasn't much I could do until he did something. Yeh well he's hurt me now hasn't he? So what are you going to do? Is he expelled yet? It's not that simple. He attacked me in my own house! How is it not that simple? It wasn't on school property. This is stupid. Calm down. Tell me what happened? He chased me home, burst into my house and attacked me, and when he saw my dad he just kind of went weird. Weird? Yeah he kind of just ran off. Not surprising.

Could you just shut up a minute! - I'm trying to listen... - Oi! I'm trying to listen to the messages alright? I can't hear a thing over the TV. It's not all about you. A friend of Arthur's expressed concern to me the other day about his home life saying he visited the house and was worried that Arthur wasn't safe. We'll need to organise for the school's support officer to pay a visit to your home to make sure everything is okay as we're becoming quite concerned for Arthur's well being. He can't stay here. This place is a dump. - This guy's a mess. - No wonder. Just look at this poor kid. He'd be better off without him. Yeh well can't be any worse... - What a mess! - Oi! Take the kid. Put him somewhere better than this. - Get off of me! - MAN 3: You can't stay here. Get off of me! We're going to take you somewhere safe. ARTHUR'S DAD: Tuck yourself in, you look a mess. I need to sort you out. Sort yourself out. [Grunting] ARTHUR: Ok, watch your step, watch your step. Alright. [Grunting] [Taking deep breaths] [Grunting] Okay. Where'd you get this from? I told you I found it. - Found it? - Yeh. You, you bloody stole it. I've not stolen from someone in a wheelchair. You're a thief as well as a bloody kidnapper. So what are you saying that I've pulled someone out of a wheelchair, dragged them along the floor, made them just sit there whilst I wheel you somewhere? Is that your theory? Well... well, it's not just appeared from nowhere has it? I just found it in an alley. Like this. [♪♪♪] Alright, dad, um... ...this is like a... ...it's like a magic well... ...and um... ...it's gonna make you better. [Birds chirping] Come on. Come on, get up, come on. Come on, come on.

[Coughs] TOMMY'S MOM: What are you doing home? I'm just getting something then I'm going back. TOMMY'S MOM: You can't just barge in here without warning. What if I had a friend round? Right, okay, sorry I'm going. TOMMY'S MOM: Bring me back some cigs, and don't go smoking any of them yourself. - You'll get cancer. - Yeh okay! Bye mum! I will! TOMMY'S MOM: Don't slam the door! [Sighs] Oi! Tommy! Tommy? Come on. Why are you being nice to me? My dad used to work here when I was proper little. I remember, yeah. They closed it down when I was like 11 or something. I used to come here all the time after school. When mum was at work as well. Get to sit in the staff room and pretend I was one of the workers. Dad even bought me a hat. Had my name written across the top of it. They even let me hang it up in the back room. It was like I was one of them. And when they closed down the factory, I asked my dad if he had my hat. He said he'd left it here. So I tried coming back but it was gone. I asked him if he could get it back. Ring them up and find out where it went or something. Did you get it back? Nah. Stupid really. They must have sold it or something. The old bathhouse. That's where I go. What's in there? A girl. A girl? Is this your "In a Relationship" girl? [Chuckles] Yeah. She's really cool as well. Eh. Delphina. What sort of name is Dolphina. No honestly that is her name. Delphina. Is she fit? Erm, yeh I mean I think that she does a lot of swimming and stuff so... No. No, is she hot? Oh, um, she's on um, fleek. That's... that's not... Yeh that's not, you don't really use it like that. Right, well are we going in or? If you just wait here I'll go make sure she's around. Please Silver. - Don't. - It's time pet. He's brought someone here. He's drunk and he's brought another boy to see Delphina. He's... he's scared! Okay? He's scared or confused or stupid but he loves her Silver, you know he loves her! Oh, he loves her, alright. But why now? He's been coming here for weeks and weeks, every day! You must have known, Silver? You must? You think I couldn't have stopped him? I let him come, you silly girl. I asked the water goddesses to sing to him. I chased him inside. Let him believe... and fall in love. You're evil! I asked her to stop and chased him away because I knew that would draw them together. And they obeyed. You lasses always end up with the ones you shouldn't, eh, Laurel? You told her off! You told her it was too soon. Why couldn't you have just taken him before... The water goddesses want sacrifice! Not death. Sacrifice. What greater sacrifice than the water nymph's first love? Delphina! It's me, Arthur Braxton! I'm here! DELPHINA: What's wrong with you? Nothing. DELPHINA: You seem weird. I don't like you like this. Why didn't you come back the other day? The water didn't heal my dad. At all. I didn't know if it would work like that. Well, it didn't. He just nearly drowned. I'm sorry Arthur. The boy who bullies me is outside. He's been nice to me today. I wanted to show him you and prove that I have a girlfriend. No, Arthur. You promised. And you promised me that my dad would get better! No! That's not fair! Arthur, no one can know I'm here. I'm gonna go and get him now. If you could just stay here please. Please don't do this Arthur, please. Please! Arthur! Look out! [Grunting] Don't hurt him! I need the water. DELPHINA: Silver no! Water goddesses! Don't hurt him Silver. Please, you can't! Get off of me! Go! [Delphina screams] - Where's she going? - Away. Down there. For her own protection. Now go! [Delphina screams] ♪ Follow me ♪ ♪ Peace at the bed of the sea ♪ SILVER: I offer you this final sacrifice. Arthur! This broken child, to bring her back. TOMMY: Hello? Twatston! - Come back, come back! - What are you doing? Come on let's get you out of here dude. - Delphina! - You've had a bit too much. Get off of me! Get off of me! - What's wrong with you? - Get off of me! Delphina! [Taking deep breaths] She's gone. [♪♪♪] Silver! Silver! Silver! Silver, Silv... Just one left lass. Silver, please. I've spent years to bring someone here for her. Someone who could make her happy like I never could... You think your daughter's happiness is more important than my daughter's life? What I've done, that's love. You think that this is what I want? You think I chose this? They have my daughter. You have no idea. [♪♪♪] What if the water goddesses are wrong? You're tearing families apart and for what? The goddesses only choose those who are lost. Those who won't be missed. I brought him here for her! You! He's in my ledger! My work, the water is all that's kept either of them alive. I'm finishing it. I'm bringing my daughter back. You should be grateful after what you did. [♪♪♪] I'm sorry Delphina. I'm so sorry.

WORRELL: Right, it has come to my attention that some of you have not been reading the posters of Mr. Worrell's WarRULES, so I will do it for you. Caught with chewing gum - one planner comment and a stern talking to. Caught making fun of maths/ saying algebra is a waste of time - instant detention.

He explained some of what's been happening, his erm, situation, and his commitment to working it out. I still don't think it's a good excuse for missing school without him notifying us, but that's something for another time. I only wanted to help, I just really needed to get a fuller picture of... Sir, you said that you spoke to my dad? Yes, Arthur, listen. He's told me all about what's been going on... I need to go. MR. WORRELL: Uh, where you need to go, is back in that chair. It's fine sir, alright. Everything's... fine. Sit down. Arthur, wait! [Exhales] Bloody hell. [Indistinct chatter in distant] Sorry! GIRL 1: Hey!

I've not even been here. Don't know anything that's going on in your life. Nothing interesting, I promise. I don't know a single thing about you. Have you got a girlfriend? I did have. And then she had to go away, so. Do you like her? Yeah. Well what are you doing here then? I'm looking after you. Arthur. I messed up when your mum left. I didn't understand her, not deep down, not like a husband should. I got comfy. She felt like I let her down because I didn't listen to her. And when she left I just gave up on her. I didn't fight for her. And us Arthur Braxton's we're not known for fighting, but... Well you fought didn't you? For me. You got me through this and that's a damn sight more than I've been able to do. Dad... [Sobbing] Where do you know her from? This mystery lass. Is it school? No, there's this place in town actually. But they're gonna knock it down anyway so... Well then where are you gonna see her next? Let me give you a hand with that. Oh thanks mate. Don't wanna drop it. Many hands make light work.

I'm not giving you anything. I wasn't asking. These names, they're all the people you've killed. Sacrifices, lad. To the water goddesses. They have... something I want. Bring Delphina back! SILVER: Once I've used you, it'll be done. And I can finally get to my daughter. You're going to bring her back! [Screaming] Water goddesses! [Grunting] I offer you this final sacrifice.

Sorry you were brought into all of this. Go! [Crying] Go, girl! I need the water! No! I won't let you hurt him! He's mine! [Panting] SILVER: I need the water! I don't care! I love him more than anything. SILVER: But what about what I love? It's beautiful down there Silver. You have no idea. You've caused so much pain to bring her back but she's happy without you. [Grunts] [♪♪♪] Water goddesses. I offer you this final sacrifice, this broken child. I have to go Arthur. No! I have to take him away, but without him... Without his sacrifices. His power kept me alive. I can't survive here. Will you come back? - Arthur... - Will you come back! One day soon, I'll meet you outside and we'll dance like twats in the rain.
