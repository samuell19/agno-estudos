Which is supposed to be a very good liberal art school. Definitely tonguey enough for my mother. With its beautiful rural campus. Which is total bullshit, because you get ticks, walking in the grass. Yardley is more structured than the first college I went to. I lasted a few months at one of those serious Ivy League sudo intellectual joints, which my mother thought would give me an "appropriate" education. She says I have a high IQ, and I'm not living up to my potential. Even though last weekend I made 20 grand playing poker. But I'll get to that. Yardley is where I met Ashleigh, from a school paper. That's my girlfriend - Ashleigh Enright. My dad knew one of her father's banks in Arizona. And naturally, with those family credentials, my mother wants us to get married, sight unseen. It's the one area I agree on with my mother. Because even though we've only been going out for a few months. I'm hopelessly in love with Ashleigh. I got an interview with Roland Pollard. Oh my Gosh, that is amazing. How did you land that? He has a new movie coming out this fall. And the assignment originally went to Priscilla McCain, but she's totally got mono, so I'm doing it. Mono's like a two credit chores at the school. Listen Ash, I think this is great for you. When is it? It's the 28th of this month. A Saturday. And it's on campus? - It's in Manhattan. - It's in Manhattan, are you serious? This is fantastic, we were always talking about going into Manhattan for a special weekend. Look, I'm going to make a reservation at the Carlyle. It's the place I'm always telling you about, with the piano player at the bar, he sings his old Broadway tunes. I'll take you up for lunch and dinner, how does that sound? We go see around city. - Yeah. - Yeah? I mean, it will cost a fortune. Relax, I'm loaded, I scored 20 big ones last Sunday. - Not another crap game? - No, stud poker this time. Sitting there with 3 tens, and some guy with aces up keeps raising me. How did you get all the money to play in such a big poker game? My horse came in this weekend. I'm telling you this is why I have to go to Vegas. I'm a gambler and I don't know how else to put it. I've always wanted you to have to show me around Manhattan. This is going to be absolutely fantastic. I'm going to, maybe, get in touch with my dad's ticket brocker. He'll get us tickets to Hamilton, how does that sound? Actually, I don't want all my parents know I'm in town that weekend. Why not? My mother is having her big annual fall gala, and she's apoplectic I'm not coming. I told her I have a major paper due, otherwise I have to put an appearence. It's like death. It's like having ... Drinks with a hundred bullshit people, not one of which has ever been turned down by a co-op. I can't believe it. An interview with the director of "Winter Memories". Didn't we see "Winter Memories" together on our first date? I think so. I'm just so excited. You have to help me come up with the list of profound questions to ask him. I don't want to come off like a twit. You are not going to come off like a twit. Actually, now that I'm thinking about it. We can't stay at the Carlyle, it's too close to my parents house. But I want you to have a park view. You know what? We going to stay at the Pierre. That way you can have a park view, it's a safe distance from my parents house. Then after dinner we're going to go to the Carlyle, we go to bar, and spend some time there. It's very old New York. I really love it. The murals are by Ludwig Bemelmans. I've only been to Manhattan twice, you know. Once when I was 2, and then once when I was 12. All I remember is we got incredible bargains. My parents could not believe that you could buy a Birkin bag and a Rolex on the blanket off the street. For only 200 dollars. Are there any other questions you can think of that I can ask him? Find out who influenced him more on love. Denis de Rougemont or Ortega y Gasset. How do you always know all that stuff? I read, I just don't read what they give us at school. Do I really care who wins between Beowulf & Grendel, no I don't. Maybe if I had a little money on it. I don't know why I'm so nervous. No college reporters won a Pulitzer, right? I do not think so. You are going to be fine, don't put so much pressure on yourself. I think it's going to be great. Listen, I want to see the Weegee photos at MoMA, and I booked us a dinner at Daniel's. It's kind of a nice place, we can dress up for it. It would be really nice. And I splurged on the suite at the Pierre. What the hell, right? It's poker winnings, it's not even real money. Gatsby, it's beautiful! I wanted to do something special. The flowers. - That's not me, I don't know what that is. - Champagne. Look at that view. I wanted it to be high enough so you could see Central Park. Central Park. Exciting. Thank you so much, sir. I really appreciate that. Thank you. Later maybe we could take a carriage ride? Yeah. If it doesn't rain. We could ride in the rain, it's very moody. It's very romantic. I prefer it. What time is it? Yeah we should go, this is hotel at downtown. It might be a little bit of a traffic. - It is far? - It's in Soho. You are going to like Soho. It's filled with creative people. Then it got commercially expensive, so all the creative people moved to Tribeka. And that got expensive, so they all moved to Brooklyn. Next move is back in with their parents. He's only giving me an hour. It's good, we have a 01:30 lunch reservation. What are you going to do while I'm upstairs? I do not know. Just roam around Soho, maybe visit my brother. I can't say how nice it is that you're back in the city. If it weren't for you I don't know if I would ever find my way back to Yardley. - What would you do? - Find some brilliant way to ruin my life. Hi, I'm here for Mr. Roland Pollard. Roland, this is Ashleigh Enright from Yardley. - How do you do? - Ashleigh, this is Roland. The screening is all set up. We are running on a really tight schedule. First of all, I'd just like to say that what an honor this is for me. I just want to say you're by far the most interesting american director. Thank you. I write in the arts for a paper and I always put you right in the class with Renoir and De Sica. I'm surprised to hear that someone your age is familiar with Renoir and De Sica. Film is my total thing. I've seen all the american classics. Particularly the europeans. Kurosawa is my favourite. Technically, he is not european, technically, he's, obviously, japanese. But you really speak to my soul. What college are you from? Yardley. It's small. I know it well, my first wife went there. - Really? - Yes. Brilliant woman, long blonde hair and a state of the art overbite. Very sexy. A philosophy major. To tell you the truth I didn't deserve her, and I didn't end up with her either, so ... Well, that's a... Neither, either, nor yawn. I imagine. I guess, it's probably more yawn that either. Are you from New York? Tucson, Arizona. What does your family do? I was afraid you'd ask. My father owns banks. Is that bad? I know what you are thinking. "Republicans, the one percent". But we are not. We're just, totally Episcopalians, who happen to just be rich. That's how my Ashley was. Who's your Ashley? My first wife. The one with a long blonde hair and a state of the art overbite. Her name was Ashley? A-S-H-L-E-Y. Mine is A-S-H-L-E-I-G-H. You use a Forbes 500 spelling. Since this is your first meaningful assignment, would you like a scoop? Of? Inside information. You've heard what the term is. Oh, a scoop! I'd rather share this with you, than some slick gossip-hungry newspaper. Oh my God. You keep going, I'm liable to have my famous psychological hiccup fits. When I'm nervous I stammer. Is this the scoop? No, that's not the scoop. The worst, of course, is when I'm sexually conflicted. Then I'll hiccup indefinitely. The scoop is - I am not happy with this film. You're not? I am thinking of quitting, actually. That's the scoop. If I could speak frankly, Mr. Pollard. You've never had mass appeal. You're too original. And you've never once made one single commercial concession. You are a free creative spirit. Like Van Gogh, or Rothko, or Virginia Woolf. Of course, they all committed suicide. It's a very sweet thing to say, actually. You should read me on you. I wrote that your best work is yet to come. It's only in, Yardley Argus, but we have a good circulation. You think that my best work is yet to come? I do. And I haven't seen your new film, but I'm willing to bet... Would you like to? I'd love to. I know how secretive you are. Which I, totally, respect. What are you doing now? Now? Yes now. I'm screening it for Ted Davidoff, who did the script. I know who he is, he writes all your movies, he's a genious. The screening has some last minute changes. Face saving changes. How long does it run? I guess I could shift my lunch plans. One thing about New York City - you are here or you are nowhere. You cannot achieve this level of anxiety, hostility and paranoia anywhere else. It's really exhilarating. Anyhow, I decided to treat myself to a cigarette holder, which makes me look dapper and serves the double duty of delaying the inevitable onset of cancer or emphysema. I smoke too much. So then who do I meet, but one of the most obnoxious and revolting characters from my high school. Welles? Hey. Troller. I heard that you flanked out of freshman year. No, I didn't flunk out, I transferred up to Yardley, because the first place I tried was too unstructured. They word around is flunked. No. Where the hell is Yardley, Afghanistan? Upstate. - Have you heard about Finletter? - No. He got thrown out of Princeton for passing bed checks. - No, I didn't hear about that. - The big deal. Because of his father he's got like the all-time golden parachute. He could commit mass murder and he'd still have a cushy job waiting for him. - It's a weird way to put it. - And Millstein is marrying Carol Durand. Which, I'll never understand, because she resembles Yasser Arafat. Not to mention she's an Ice Queen. You can't believe everything. What are you doing in town? It's my girlfriend, I'm just showing her around for the weekend. - Who is your girlfriend? - You wouldn't know her. But she's got a name, hasn't she? Ashleigh. Like Ashley Wilkes in "Gone with the Wind"? That whimp. What about Josh Loomis? I just saw Josh. He's shooting a movie at Minetta. - A movie? - It's his student film. NYU project, it looked completely stupid to me. You should stop by. He's with Evans and the younger Tyrell. You've always liked Josh. That turned into a classic whimp. Did you say Amy's younger sister is there? Is Amy there? Amy is at Vassar. Big deal. I'm impressed. Flat-chested. Like two dimes on a hanging board. - Amy was beautiful. - Yeah, if you like Grace Kelly. What are you in town for? My girlfriend, she has an interview with Roland Pollard for the school paper. Who's that? It's a director. He did "Winter Memories", "Moonlight". Oh yeah! I can't stand his flicks. All that whimpy emotional probing, and never a single decent toilet joke. You should go and watch them shoot. You could be in it. They're looking for volunteers. With that cigarette holder you could be the perfect milk toast nerd. I'm running a little bit late. I wouldn't trust my girl with a big time Hollywood director. Good to know. - You didn't ask me what I am doing. - What are you doing? I'm only pre-med. We have paw at the boarding of Grenada. I can't make lunch. What? Why not? - I have to see his film. - You do? It's an unbelievable opportunity. And then we're going to discuss it after and everything. How did this develop? I though you just had an hour with him. So did I, but then he started opening up to me. He did? He is going through this real artistic crisis. There's a real story here. We have a lunch reservation. You wouldn't want me to say no to the screening? I am here for work. We'll have plenty of time. When? The film's going to take a couple of hours. I mean. It's 1 now, the movie will probably be over around 3 and then I'll have all afternoon. How did you get friendly so fast? He's going through this whole self-sabotage trip. It's a scoop. Is that him? Yes. He's a little older looking than I thought. It's a good look though, don't you think? He is a sufferer. So what, what's so great about suffering? You should hear him talk about the arts, he's so passionate. I can see how all of his leading ladies fall in love with him. Do you want me to meet him? - I wouldn't want you to spook him. - It's okay. No, he's a very private person. And distraught. I'll see you later and I'll meet you back at Carlyle at 3. It's the Pierre. The Carlyle is tonight. What the hell is it about older guys that seem so appealing to women. All they are is decrepit. What is sexy about short-term memory loss? I never want to get old. Of course, with my smoking habit, I'll be spitting blood at 40. If she's going to get some big inside news story, she has to put in time with this guy. Meanwhile, it's going to rain soon. Gatsby! Josh. How are you man? - It's nice to see you. - It's good to see you. I just ran into Alman Troller. He told me you were shooting a short film down here, I thought I'd stop by and say hi. It's just my mid-term project, it's nothing big actually. How's Yardley, is that where you are? It's okay, I'm not really liking it too much, I'd rather be going to school in the city, but... You know my mother. If it's not the perfect image, she bites down that cyanide capsule she keeps for special emergencies. I didn't know that. The only thing I remember about them is that they had that fundraiser for Jeb Bush, right? - Right. - Right. So listen, how are you? How's life? What's going on here? What are you doing here? You know, just out here trying to create modern film-noir classic. Okay, alright. - Do you want to be in it? - No. - Come on, man. - No. We're just light on extras, we have all those people who never showed. You wouldn't have to talk or anything. Seriously, you just get in the car, and then on action you let the girl out, that's it. - Okay, I don't have to talk? - None. Zero words. - I can handle that. - Okay, there you go. You remember Chan, don't you? - Chan Tyrell. - Hi. - You're Amy's little sister, right? - Good to see you. - Should we do this? - Yeah, go in there. I like that coat, actually, no, keep that on. Listen, I hear your older sister's at Vassar now, right? Yeah, political science major. Can you believe it? I mean Amy never heard the news that Lincoln was shot. Chan Tyrell. This is insane. You were a little girl, and now you are, actually, a young woman. You are not going to start singing Gigi, are you? - I'm not going to start singing... - So here's the story. She is totally mad with loss and she can't let go off you. She kisses you and then she bursts away. Chan Tyrell. Incidentally, I apologise in advance for ruining your scene. - I'm not an actor. - I'm not an actress either. I'm just helping out a friend. And we kiss? Yeah, that's why I never wanted to be an actress. You have to fake passion with all kinds of weirdos. - Thank you. - Nevermind. Just kiss me so I can really feel it in my toes. I used to kiss your older sister, did she ever say anything about that or no? I don't know, I don't recall. I think maybe she said you were a 4. - A 4? She said I was a 4? - I don't know, maybe a 6. Maybe a 6, I can't recall. Just this kiss, I want it to be hot. If we are going to do it, let's do it right. - Good work ethic. - Thank you. Action. Cut. Are you going to keep your mouth closed? I have a girlfriend, Chan. I don't think I can do this. I'm sorry, I think I froze. You have a girlfriend? Who's your girlfriend? Her name is Ashleigh, she's from Yardley. She's from Tuscon originally. Tuscon? You are dating a girl from Arizona? Do I have your permission? What do you guys talk about, cactuses? Rattlesnakes. Arizona? That would be great for your asthma. I don't have asthma. When we were kissing, I thought I heard you wheezing. I always remembered you as a very snotty kid. Ready? What are you up to now? - I am studying design at a fashion Institute. - That's unique. Rolling. Scene 19, take 2. Action. Cut. That's better. Josh, he's way too uptight to open up his mouth. Are you still seeing that shrink? Give me a break, alright? I was just taking a walk. He asked me to help out, alright? I've never acted before. - Scene 19, take 3. - Action. Josh, it's starting to rain. And cut. Great. See, I knew you could do it. And I won't tell your girlfriend. Josh, you like it, you want a different version? - I can... - No, we go with that version. That's the version, we're sticking with that. Alright, well, have fun in Arizona. And whatever you do, don't get lost in a desert and die of thirst. I'll be sure to bring a canteen. Don't fall in the Grand Canyon too, it's really deep. She's always been the pain in the ass, kid sister. How could she not be? Amy was gorgeous, and so sexually advanced. Word on Amy was she performed an oral sex at the bar mitzvah. Maybe they should make that a part of every jewish holiday. Certainly beats fasting. It's also a great way to celebrate the Jewish New Year, what a great Hanukah gift. I wonder what's been bothering Hunter. Something was definitely on his mind when I called him. - Gatsby! - Surprise. - I told you I might drop in. - That's crazy! Listen, if you have something to do I can come back... - No, I have nothing to do. - Good to see you. How are you? - I'm good, you? - Good. Are you coming for Mom's party? No, you can't tell her I'm here, okay? It's okay, Hunter, you can pull it off. You are engaged and not in the house now, she's not going to take your phone away. - If Mom finds out she'll die. - No, she won't, she'll live. And she's not going to find out. Well, count me in. It's Ashleigh, my girlfriend, she has to do an interview with Roland Pollard, the film director for the school paper. It's a big coup. Ashleigh? Someone the mom's high on? - She's never even met her. - Hunter, your parents want to ... - Gatsby, It's so good to see you! - It's good to see you, how are you? I'm good, what are you doing in town? His girlfriend is interviewing Roland ... Pollard, the film director, but, do me a favor don't tell my mom I'm here, it's going to be a big party ... He hates parties, Mr. Anti-social. You always hated Mom's literary salons. It's rich housewifes who have the leisure to pursue esoteric culture. The out of work, discussing the out of print. She just wanted to make sure that we are exposed to great literature. What about Jimmy Cannon then? Or what about Tom Adair? It's not all giant insects and madeleines. You are not going to duck out of our wedding, huh? How can he? He's the best man. He cries at weddings. He's not as tough as he makes out. He cries at weddings and funerals. Same reason. I'm going to go take a shower. But there's coffee. - I'm so glad you're here. - It's nice being here. I've always liked her. Gatsby. - What's the matter? - Gatsby. I don't want to go through with this wedding. What? I can't do it. I can't, and I can't pull out now. It would kill her, it's two hundred guests invited, they booked ... the Century Club, they booked an orchestra! God, save me! Okay, alright. What happened? You'll think I'm so stupid. I'm not going to think you're stupid, just tell me what happened? I can't, it's too stupid. You're making me anxious, I want to hear this fascinating piece of stupidity. She's ... bright. Gatsby, she's nice, she's kind. So? I can't stand the way she laughs. What? Yeah, I can't take her laugh. - Her laugh? - Yes. Yeah, her laugh. Hunter, that's probably the most idiotic thing I've heard in my life. I told you'd think it's stupid. What's wrong with her laugh? Listen to it, it's a total turn-off. How much do you love her? I do, I love her, I love her, it's just her laugh. If you love her then get over it. I can't. I've tried. I've tried. Last night, we were talking in bed and she laughed and I couldn't make love to her. - What? - I couldn't, I was impotent. From her laugh? - It's happened before. - Hunter, you have to see a shrink. - I'm serious. - I don't need a shrink. I know what the problem is - she has a fatal laugh. A cross between Dad's sister Betty and Lennie in "Of Mice and Men". I've never heard of a problem like that before. You are young, Gatsby. The world is full of tragic little dealbreakers. Haven't you been seeing Lily for over a year? Why is this coming up now? Have you talked to her about it? I brought it up, tactfully, but I don't think she realises how serious it's gotten. I love her, but I can't marry her, Gatsby. I won't be able to have sex with her. No, you mean you don't want to marry her so you're focusing on this laugh insanity? Spare me the fruits of your Upper East Side talking, listen to her laugh. When she comes down, we'll get her to laugh. You'll see what I mean. I can't. - I can't do this, I'm sorry. - Rollie. I know, I'm sorry, Ted. - Rollie, come on. - It's actually, it's physcially... - Don't do this. - making me sick. Don't do this. - It's humiliating. - It's a process, Rollie. - Your changes are shit. - Rollie, sit down. - Everything that I did is shit. - Not shit, different, different. Mr. Pollard. - It's not different. - Not all the changes work, but some are good. Thank you for coming, Ashleigh, I need to get a little air. - It's a process. - I need some space. - Come and sit down. - I need to get out. Don't do this. - I need to think about. - Don't! No booze. - Please, no booze. - What? Come on. You just watched 2 hours of an existential steaming shit pile and that's all that you can say to me? - It's a process, we do this every time. - Ted, Ted. Rollie, come on, back. Don't drink. Oh, God. - Shouldn't we go afer him? - That's the sure sign he is going to drink. You go, you can go. I have to watch it all to be able to talk to him intelligently about it. I love the movie so far. - You do? - I do. Let's go back. There's a high-stakes card game later at a Fremont Hotel. I can't make it, but I know you love that kind of thing. You want me to call Joe Cohen, and say you'll take my chair? I would love a high-stakes card game, I'm loaded right now, but Ashleigh and I, we have plans for tonight. I'm dying to meet Ashleigh. I know, I don't know where she is right now. - I was supposed to show her city today. - You better take an umbrella. Watch, I'll make her laugh. I was just telling Gatsby... Larry Nash told me a great joke. Two cannibals are eating a comedian and one says: "Hey, do you taste something funny?" That is so ufunny. Okay, that's my que, Hunter, lovely to see you as always. Lily, thank you for the coffee. - I heard one more. - Sure. A homeless man stopped a Jewish mother on the street and said: "Lady, I haven't eaten in 3 days. And she said: "Force yourself". Hello, Ashleigh, what's going on? You said you were going to call me 30 minutes ago. I know, but the film got delayed. I'm up at this screening room place. It's fine, just meet me at the Museum of Modern Art on 53rd Street. We'll grab a bite to eat there and then we are going to go see the Weegee's. - I can't. I can't. - What do yo mean, why not? Because I'm onto a real story here. This is a 70 million dollar movie and Rollie is very unhappy with it. You call him Rollie? Yeah, and Ted and I, we have to find him. We have to find him and talk with him. Before he adds one of his crazy fits, and then re-edits the whole thing and ruins it. Who is Ted? Gatsby, I can't talk right now. But I'll call you as soon as I'm through. And if I'm running late, I'll just meet you back at the Plaza. It's not the Plaz... It's the Carlyle! It's a bar and the piano for tonight. He's not at the hotel and he didn't show up for the press interview, so he's wallowing in self-loathing somehere, drinking Courvoisier, thinking of new ways to screw up our work. I thought the film was full of wonderful things. Me too. Tell him, you ... Tell him, tell Roland. Because hearing that from me won't mean anything. I'm always at this end of the argument, but you are fresh, honest, new generation woman. Especially a pretty one, maybe ... You may... Come on, let's find him. Are you okay? - Yeah. - Come on. He doesn't like her laugh? No, Ashleigh's laugh is perfect. Let's go, Ashleigh, we're blowing the day and it's so moody out. We could be on a ferry, or the top of the Empire State Building, black and white. - Yeah, he was here. - He was here? He seemed very distraught. He knocked back a couple of brandies. Mumbled something about heading out to the studio. Okay. Let's take my car and head out to Queens. - Queens? - Yeah, it's a big film studio. Do you still want to come? Definitely. When Rollie gets drunk and morose, he likes to wander around the sound stages and pretend he's Norma Desmond. - Thanks. - Sure. Can I ask you a few questions? Since I am on assignment. Sure. What's your favorite film of Rollie's? "Winter Memories", the one in Venice. When did you first see it? It's with Gatsby, actually, it was on our very first date. Dialogue made me want to kiss him. That line about love and death, being two sides of the same coin. Did you understand it? No. I got confused, and felt insecure. Like I wanted to, just, be held and kissed. Have you ever been to Venice? No, but Gatsby has. - Oh my God! - What? I knew it! I knew it! - Are you okay? - Oh God! You turned all white. I knew it! She was lying! - Who? - Connie, my wife! - She's seeing Lipszyc! - Who's Lipszyc? She said she was going shopping with her sister, in Connecticut. But she's walking into Lipszyc's building! Is Lipszyc a spy? What? No, Larry Lipszyc. My friend, my best friend. My best friend. I can't believe it. She must... They're having an affair. Oh God, are you okay? You are clutching your heart. Okay, here's what we do. We sit here, we wait until she comes out, and then I'll confront her. I hope there's not a gun in here in glove compartment, like in your movies. You better go. You go. No, I can't leave you alone. You are all white and shaky. Breathe. Deeply breathe. Deeply. Dr. Ross said breathe. Deeply. Breathe deeply. No, not you. Me. Oh God. Taxi! Taxi! Oh my God, Chan. What are you doing here? What the hell, you were shooting ... - Hey, you take it, I'm getting out of this one. - No, no, no, get in, Gatsby. - Are you sure? - I'll drop you. - Hey, where are you going? - You remember, the same 5th Avenue joint. I remember your appartment well for my days with Amy. I remember you calling for her, my parents kept warning her about you. Warning? Why the hell would they be warning her? Because on the first date you took her walking in the rain and she got bronchial pneumonia. For Christ's sake, I'm never going to get over this. You can't get it from being wet! Don't yell at me. I thought it was romantic. That's because it is romantic. - It's a romatic gesture. - That's what I'm saying. You should tell that to Ashleigh. She thinks I'm nuts. Who's Ashleigh? That rodeo queen you're dating? She's not a cowgirl, she comes from one of the biggest banking families in Tuscon. She was a dead butone, actually. She came out. She came out? Is she gay? No, she's not gay, she's charming and beautiful. And we were supposed to have this... Goddamn weekend in the city together, and suddenly she's... Parked down with all these interviews for the school paper. She's ambitious, you should find that admirable. One, it was supposed to be one little ... One tiny little, lousy, hour intervew. Instead, you know. Lost the whole, goddamn, weekend. Would you just relax? - I don't really know why? - I'm having a hard time relaxing, Chan. Because this was going to be a special weekend. Instead I'm out here in a ... Wandering streets, like Hagar in a goddamn desert or something. Don't tell me, tell her. Tell her to get her priorities straight. You want to drink some wine, walk in the rain and give her bronchitis. Okay, look she's, apparently, onto a very big story. She takes her job very seriously, alright? Fine, then get over it. I'm in the process of getting over it. Unless you are worried somebody's hitting on her. - What the hell does that mean? - I don't know. Is she interviewing attractive men? I've never really thought about it. I don't know. Some might say they are interesting. Then maybe you better step in and assert yourself. - Do you think I have to be more demanding? - I would. These are like movie big shots she's hanging out with. - Suits? - Yes, a director and a screenwriter. Artists, they are usually passionate. Oh, Jesus Christ! Okay, you're right, I have to call her now. The sooner the better. - You think there's that much of a rush? - I don't know. Oh, Christ, alright. It's your idea. What do you think I should say? - There's nothing you can say. - What do you mean? Without sounding possessive. Christ, Chan, you just encouraged me to call her. Now I'm asking for your help and you are telling me there's nothing I can say? You are so wishy washy. Now that I see your M-O I know exatly why Amy 86ed you. No. Amy didn't dump me, I got sick of seeing her. Yeah, because everytime you'd call, and I'd say it was you on the phone, she'd wave her arms and say "I'm not in, I'm not in". Hey, Gatsby? Hey, Ashleigh. Listen. Look, I know you are very busy, and that's why we came to New York, right? And no one has more respect for honest ambitions than I do. Do I have to listen to this without an airsick bag? I can't talk to you right now. I'm kind of involved in the situation. We have a number of things planned for today. I'm very busy right now. But, I really, I can't explain it over the phone. Ashleigh, we were talking about one movie interview. What could possible be so secretive about that? What's so CIA? Unless there's some funny business going on? I'll talk to you later. Bye, Gatsby. Oh, these, goddamn, cellphones are ... I don't know, to me it sounds dubious to the max. It sounds dubious to you because you have sinister mind. - You must really love her. - I do, she's a breath of fresh air. She's charming and delightful. She's pretty. She's sexy and somehow at the same she's witty. She sings very nicely. She plays the flute. I don't know how to break this to you. But I'm sick of hearing about her, okay? Was that your boyfriend? Gatsby. Yeah. - Are you still dizzy? - No, I'm okay. What's Gatsby do? He goes to Yardley too. Which he refers to as "Forced law on University." Is he a journalist too? He's not really focused professionally. I think that in his wildest dreams he'd like to be Sky Masterson. - A Broadway bookie? - He's a little eccentric. In what way? Eccentric? I think it has to do with the fact that he and his mom never really hit it off. She was always forcing him to read everything, and learn piano... He is really smart. He was one of those students who... He doesn't have to study for a test and then he just aces it. Sounds like me. To tell you the truth. Don't tell anybody, but I think he has a touch of Asperger's. - You know what Chan? - Yeah? I'm going to get out of here too. - What are you doing now? - Why? Why, because I have a little bit of time to kill. And I thought about going to Modern Museum. Look at the WeeGee exhibit. Oh, I see. You have nothing better to do so you want me to keep you company? You know what? Forget it. I dated your older sister. You've always had a little bit of an attitude, okay? I'm not looking for any trouble. I have to check out some paintings at the Mat's Profession Class. If you want to keep me company. I don't know why you couldn't have just... Fine, it's going to be fun. We can get on each other's nervs. Alright, let me change, I'm soaked. Are you hungry? I'd give you an Arizona lunch, but we are all out of beef jerky. Brings back a lot of memories. My folks are in East Hampton for the weekend. How come you didn't go? I've got a date tonight. You? Don't be startled, it turnes out I'm desirable. Who's the unfortunate victim? You wouldn't know him, he's a girlfriend's dermatologist. It's romantic. Don't forget to show him those three irregular black moles on your back. I'm sure they're nothing. I really hope I won't regret not going to the Hamilton's. The beach is so pretty in the rain too. - Would you have to be with your parents. - So what? I love my parents. You know them, they are fun. Don't you have fun with your parents? No, fun is not the word I would use. Alright, I'll be right back. - Hey, listen, can I play your piano? - Yeah, go ahead, it's a family heirloom. ♪ I make a date for golf ♪ ♪ And you can bet your life it rains ♪ ♪ I try to give a party ♪ ♪ And the guy upstairs complains ♪ ♪ I guess I'll go through life ♪ ♪ Just catchin' colds and missin' trains ♪ ♪ Everything happens to me ♪ ♪ I never miss a thing ♪ ♪ I've had the measles and the mumps ♪ ♪ And every time I lay an ace ♪ ♪ My partner always trumps ♪ ♪ I guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps ♪ ♪ Everything happens to me ♪ ♪ At first I thought that you could break this jinx for me ♪ ♪ That love would turn the trick to end despair ♪ ♪ But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me ♪ ♪ So I've mortgaged all my castles in the air ♪ ♪ I've telegraphed and phoned ♪ ♪ Send an 'Airmail Special' too ♪ ♪ Your answer was 'Goodbye' ♪ ♪ There was even postage due ♪ ♪ I fell in love just once ♪ ♪ And then it had to be with you ♪ ♪ Everything happens to me ♪ That's pretty. I love a "cocktail lounge" piano. Outside it drizzles, grey. New York City, enveloped in the light mist. Two lovers have a date to meet at 6 o'clock. At Grand Central Station, under the clock, like in the movie. I love that movie, but I see it outside. At the East River? With the tugboats around the water? - I love tugboats. - Almost, you're in the Rainbow Park. I know! I know! Under the clock. Which clock? The Delacorte clock, where all the animals go around in Central Park. I love it, it's very old movie. My Mom and I used to watch old movies together all the time. She would study the decor. They are so fabulously escapist. In my version he's waiting, the music plays. And she never comes. Or she's waiting and he chooses the other woman. Can't they just kiss in the rain? That sounds pretty good to me, even if it is commercial. - Picture yourself. - Okay. It's four minutes to six. You're pacing up and down, rain drops have just started to fall. You're at your Delacorte clock in Central Park. Expecting your ... Dermatologist. But he just diagnosed a carcinoma in his own limp. It's metastasizing as you wait. Would you give me a break? In my version, everything's fine. He meets me, holds me, kisses me. It's lovely. Nobody needs a biopsy. Connie! - Connie! - Ted. Is this how you are shopping with Judy in Connecticut? What are you doing here? I happen to see you out the window, from the car. By sheer chance. - Really? That's awkward, isn't it? - Awkward, awkward? You've been sleeping with him for months, haven't you? - We were going to tell you. - When? - When we moved to London? - No. Your dream? That we had moved to London? It just happened, Ted. We both fought it. I'm sure you fought it, in every hotel room, on every matress, in a backseat. This isn't about sex. It's always about sex. Everything is about sex. The economies are about sex. I can't have this outburst with you on the street. You, with my best friend. It's such a cliché, I can't believe it. Don't get down on Larry, he adores you. He identifies with you. I know, he uses my aftershave, and my wife. Who is she? - Ted, is everything okay? - What does that have to do with anything? - Who is she? - No, everything is fine, stay there Ashleigh. Keep dry. - I'm with the Yardley Argus. - The what? - The Yardley Argus. - She's a reporter, doing a piece on Rollie. On Rollie? Then what is she doing with you, following me? - Don't try and turn this around. - I'm not turning... Don't try and turn this around. You've been caught. You're caught. You, who make a fool of yourself over every young, ambitious starlet model. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? You've been having an affair with Larry Lipszyc. And you are spying on me with who? Your 15-year-old concubine? She's a journalist. - I'm 21. - She's 21. She's 21? - She's a journalist. - I have a proof of age, actually. - No, you don't need this. This always happens in bars. - You've been caight. - You know what, as long as you are a reporter. I would like to make a press release about my husband. - Really? - Can I write this down? - Sure, go ahead. - Ashleigh, please. Ask him how many times he has been unfaithful to me? She's demented. You're demented. - His secretary, the actresses, the poetess. - Wrong, wrong. - The poetess? - The poetess? Were all these women for a pleasure or for some project? Stop filling her head with lies. Ashleigh, come here. Take this address to the studio, okay? Find Rollie, come on. - Find Rollie. - I don't know my way around New York. It's okay, tell the cab driver... - Find Rollie. Stop. - Ask him if he ever slep with Samantha Leroy. - The Argus is not a tabloid. - There are no papers that are not tabloid. Encourage him about the movie, so he doesn't mangle it and ruin it, okay? Please, don't print any of this. - Don't worry, we always protect there from naughty. - I'm sure. Connie! Connie! The first time I kissed your sister was in this museum. I know, she told me. She said that you were looking at a Hieronymus Bosch and it made you feel romantic. So that you kissed her. As of she knew your shrink wasn't helping you. Don't tell she got the kiss of the 4. If she'd quoted you a figure higher I'd have her audited. There's something charming about that elegance. My mother would've liked Sargent to have painted her in just that pose. The dressed so beautifully in Paris back then. I could see moving to Paris. I never really asked you. What are you future plans, Gatsby? I don't know, I'm floundering. What does that mean? I don't know who I want to be. I just know what I don't want to be, is that terrible? So you have no game plan? I know I don't want to be a test pilot, or clergyman or proctologist, so... Ruled those out. I get it, you don't fit in. That's why I always had a crush on you when you dated Amy. - You had a crush on me? - I did, isn't it weird? I don't know, maybe it's because you took her to do oddball things. You took her to one of those divey piano bars, where no one else ever took her. I did take her to her first crap game. I know and I loved that. I loved hearing every detail. I was hoping she would get serious with you, because you were not like all the other idiots she dated. I thought you were a special idiot. I'm glad I impressed you, Chan. I remember Amy came home and she told me that you took her to Ballbay scene at Central Park and made love to her. - She told you about that? - Every moist detail. Now I embarrassed. Don't be, that night she gave you a 6. She gave me a 6? Amy. With a asterix. She said you were a little tense. Yeah, Central Park can be a little dangerous at 2 AM. - But very romantic. - Okay. And then it started to rain. That was the best part. Her hair got wet, her clothes started to cling to her body. - She started sneezing. - I don't really remember that part. Now that I think of it, Chan. You always were around, giving me the fish eye. You are just realising this now? That's all you have to say? You didn't think I was cute or attractive, anything? You seemed fine. You mean I had no physical deformities. I didn't have acromegaly or a hunchback. You know what, Chan, I wasn't really paying attention, because I was a little tense in front of your parents. Amy would make her entrance, like a, goddamn, Miss America. I'm sure Ashleigh is a beauty queen type. She is, she was an actual first-place winner at her high school in Tuscon. 4H, right? Yes, how did you guess? Ink it in. Let's get out of here. These crazy egyptians, they put all their money on an afterlife. Listen, Gatsby, let me tell you, you only look once. But once is enough if you find the right person. You think she's giving me a runaround today? I'm struggling to keep my spirits up. You really are hooked on her, aren't you? Oh my God! That's my aunt and uncle! They're here for my mother's party. What party? They remembered the date - my mother's party tonight, They going to tell her I'm here. - Okay. - I can't discuss this, I have to hide. Why don't you duck into the mummy case, I'll get some white tape. Hello? Gatsby, I finally got alone. Where are you? Let me put is this way. Have you heard of King Tut? You are where? What are you doing? Hello? Gatsby, hello? Gatsby, what a surprise! I was about to call your mother. Hi, can I help you? I'm looking for Roland Pollard. Roland Pollard? Right, he was here earlier. I'm not sure if he's still back there. Mom, it was all planned, okay? Ashleigh and I wanted to surprise you tonight. I happen to run into uncle Tyler and aunt Grace, okay? But don't worry, we are going to be there for dinner, it's going to be a great time, I just... I thought it would be a fun surprise. Oh, we spoiled your surprise. Mr. Pollard? Rollie? Hello. Can I help you? Have you seen Mr. Pollard? Rollie's gone. He left an hour ago. Did he seem okay? To be honest, he seemed a little drunk to me. Are you two friends? Oh my God! You're Francisco Vega. Is that good or bad? If my roommate was here, she'd hemorrhage. She thinks you are the greatest thing to come along since the morning-after pill. Me too. I can't believe I'm talking to Francisco Vega. Look at me, I'm a journalist and I'm reduced to total adolescence. - You're Francisco Vega! - I know that. I guess the key question here is - who are you? Who am I? Is that what you're asking who I am? - My identity? - Yeah, is it coming to you? I can't believe I'm blanking on it. Check your driver's license. Right. Yeah, right. Okay. I'm Ashleigh Enright. I knew it would be on there. I work for the Yardley Argus. I write for them. And I'm here in New York, because I'm interviewing Mr. Pollard. Wow, you look exatly the same but better. Let me tell you something. You look more beautiful than any journalist I've ever met. You can make a very sexy anchorwoman. How can you say that when you're in the papers every week with those die-models and actresses? - Get in, get in. - Where are we going? Not now guys, not now. Come on, give us a break! Come on! No! Should I be in here? Make yourself at home. - Would you like to sit down? - No, no, no. - Would you like a drink? - No thanks. Would you like to have dinner with me? Would I like to have what with you? I have no plans, but to get an early bite and then. You and I can go to a party together. Party? Dinner? What about Tiffany Griffin? I though... - I don't want to talk about her. - You two were twosome. No, we just broke up. I'm going to change into my street clothes. While you think about it, okay? Oh, Gosh. Great, now I have to take Ashleigh to my Mom's, goddamn, party. Why is that so bad? Why is that so bad, Chan? Because I wanted to spend the night with Ashleigh alone in New York, not with forego of wasp plutocrats. A forego of wasp plutocrats? Sounds like something on the menu out of a fusion restaurant. I'm not interested in the euro, or how many Basquiats somebody owns, or whether they prefer a falcon to a gulfstream. These things have no meaning to me. I noticed you haven't renounced your family's money. What does that mean? That means you could move out. Get a job, put yourself through college. Oh yeah, as of what? Piano player in the dive. Or, maybe a poker player? Dice hustler? You're bad, Chan. You are going straight to hell. There is something romantic about gamblers. And old songs. Meeting under the clock. Yeah, maybe in movies, but this is real life. Real life is fine for people who can't do any better. It's been fun killing time with you. Have fun with blue neves tonight. - Who? - Your skin doctor. At least he knows enough not to wind up in the egyptian tomb. - Vega! - Francisco! - Thanks for being here. - It is always like this? This is nothing. I'm just signing one. Thank you, thank you for being here. Sorry, we have to go. Sorry. - Francisco, who is the young lady? - I'm no one. - What do you do? - I'm no one really. I was Miss Amiability in Scottsdale. Not really a big deal. Where did you guys meet? Let's go, come on. No story here. Okay, thank you. Thank you for being here. Ciao, ciao, ciao. That's it, that's it. Alright, thank you for coming, thank you. There is so much the public wants to know about you. Is it true that you were born on the Orient Express right outside of Budapest. Are your 2 sisters as beautiful as you are? Please be honest, but be modest. They are, yeah. They are actually even pretier. Taylor especially. She looks a little bit like your girlfriend Tiffany Griffin. - Could be worse. - Yeah. Are you seriously considering making remake of "White Heat"? - Do you have a boyfriend? - Me? Yeah. Sorry I shouldn't have asked that. Sorry, I've been drinking. The candle lights are coloring your face in quite an amazing way. I'm sorry, you have a very affective smile, you know? I couldn't help but ask if you have a boyfriend or not. Do I have a boyfriend. Is that what you're asking? Yes and, technically, no. There's this boy at Yardley. But he's just a boy. He's a mere youth. We dated a few times. You must be crazy about him. Is he the captain of the football team? Football? Gatsby? No. No, he doesn't play football. He likes to figure out the point spread. So the mathematician. Not exactly. Gatsby is a... Gatsby is very dear. Very amusing. He's unusual. Quaint. That's the world I would use to describe Gatsby - quaint. He's exotic. Searching, shall we say, for his romantic dream from a vanished age. - What is this wine? - It's Chateau Meyney. I shouldn't imbibe so copiously. Alcohol plays havoc on my cerebral neurons. And how? I lose my sensor. I become loose, uninhibited. passionate, aggressive, wicked. Absurd. Hello. Is this where the poker game is? - Who are you? - My name is Gatsby Welles. - Who? - He's okay, that's Hunter's brother. I'm just going to take Hunter's chair if that's alright. Yeah, Hunter called and said you might sit in. You sure you want to play this game? He's alright. Hunter says he's a shark. - Better watch out for him. - Like a guppy. If you guys are worried, I have a little something. - This kid is loaded. - Have a seat then, my friend. I will call that. This is crazy. Maybe something's happened to her? Maybe she's in some kind of trouble. Raise, two thousand. Maybe the story led her into danger. Maybe she was kidnapped or murdered. Should I call the police? Of course, it would be so embarrassing if she turn up alive. Hey kid, do you going to call or not? That's two thousand dollars. I raise you. I reraise you. All-in. With temperature's in the 60s, rain is predicted this evening. It will be heavy at times. And more of it tomorrow, mostly cloudy with the chance of showers in the late afternoon. On a brighter note: Francisco Vega is in town with his new main-squeeze on his own. All our spies could find out is that she's Ashleigh Enright, a beauty queen, from Tuscon, Arizona. They were spotted later having drinks over candle light, and apparently exchaging sweet nothings. I was Miss Amiability in Scottsdale. Not really a big deal. - How did you guys meet? - Who's the girl? Good luck, Francisco, we are all rooting for you. That gorgeous couple, as if they need out help. Jesus, I need a drink. I need a drink. I need a cigarette. What I really need is a Berlin ballad. May I get you another? Yeah, why don't you make it a double. You want a double? It's okay, I won't be operating any form of machinery. Hello. Mom, you have to give me a chance. I said I was going to be there tonight. Ashleigh's fine. Yes, I'll wear a tie and I'll be there on time, okay? I can't really talk right now. Francisco Vega. A bullshit actor. This guy is incapable of a real moment. All those manured gestures and all that phony self-promoting liberal politics. When he offered to set himself on fire to protest climate change, they should've let him. If that's Ashleigh's taste. The world is full of beautiful women. Sorry, are you talking to me? I'm sorry, I was actually talking to myself. I know the feeling. Have you seen a movie "Out of the Past"? - Excuse me? - Jane Greer and Robert Mitchum. She was bad news. It's the luck of the draw. - Are you alone? - I am. Unless you want some company. Sure. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm Terry Ford. - My name is Gatsby Welles. What's the matter, Gatsby? You seem gloom. My girlfriend dumped me for a movie star. You know what they say: you can't fight charisma. I didn't want to drink in my room alone. Are you staying here? No, I've been coming here since they used to only serve me ginger ales by law. I love the piano players. And now I'm old enough to order gin and vermouth. Time flies. Yeah, unfortunately, it flies, coach. What's that supposed to mean? It's not always a comfortable trip. Tell me about it. What are you doing here all alone? Working. What do you do? I make dreams come true. - How do you do that? - Use your imaginion. Do we go someplace where we could be more alone? Sure. Why not. Okay. I get five hundred, sweetie. Five hundred? Right. I know what's you are thinking. Five hunderd seems pretty steep. But it's New York. How would you like to make five thousand? Five thousand? To do what? Just to be my date for a few hours at the party. Clothes stay on, no fondling, no exhange of fluids. Just a little role playing. What kind of party? Just my Mom's big fall, bullshit blowout. I won 15 G's in the poker game and I need a date with me. Classy item, who answers the name of Ashleigh Enright. - I hope I'm dressed okay. - Absolutely. It's a little fancy. - You look perfrect. - Okay. These things can be a little boring, alright? Thank you for coming. - Hey, Vega. - How are you? - Very good. - Good to see you. This guy is the best cook. You have to make on of those paella again. - Hi, doll. - Hey. How are you? I wondered if I could steal you away for 2 minutes to talk about your fall schedule and project with your name on it. - Right now? - Yes now. Okay, okay, do you mind? Just 2 minutes. - Are you going to be okay? - Yeah. Yeah? Sure? I'll be fast. Thank you. - You're Gabriela Summers. - Yes. I have so many questions for you. - For my article. - Okay. It's not that much farther. It's just up the corner here. Great, I love to walk. It's actually the same house I grew up in. I bet you went to one of those fancy school? Yeah, I did. Is true that all the kids there have charge accounts at Bergdorf and Prada and spend lots of money and do lots of drugs? I wouldn't know, I didn't hang out with the most of the kids. I just liked to watch old movies and play my violin. It's kind of weird. You were a bookworm? Not really. My mother is just... Culture vulture, according to her I must visit this museum. Or I must attend this piano recital, or see this opera. I must read my Henry James, even if Henry James puts me to sleep, you know? I like Charlie Parker. Who's that? Forget it, that's alright. You really are in a bad mood. There you are. Excuse me for the interruption. - You're here. - Yes, I am. We've been looking everywhere for you. I had to get my thoughts in line. You vanished off the planet. Mr. tortured artist. Can I speak to you alone for a minute? Yeah. I have actually been dying to talk to you. Your movie was so much better than you let me to believe. Yes? And the climax was so moving. It was very vintage Roland Pollard. Sit. I was afraid I wasn't going to see you again. Forgive me. I'm a little drunk. We were very worried about you. I spent the day, thinking, reflecting about my work, my life. I want for us to get to know each other, Ashleigh. You do? Would you consider coming with to the South of France? The where of what? Your voice is the only voice, that's adding me clarity for me in ages. The only voice that enouraged me, what I actually believed in. Like a muse. I think you had too much to drink today. I know I have. Come with me. You can wake up every morning, smelling orange trees. I'll talk to you about my new movie and I can learn from your own spoiled honesty. You can smell the orange trees. I think you are confusing me with this like total, other Ashley. L-E-Y spelling. I thought that was you! Ashleigh. - You are here. - I'm here. Everybody's here. Roland's here. I came with him. I was trying... I was trying to figure out a way to cantact you. - I apologise for today. - It's okay. You were very very understanding, thank you. - I felt really bad for you. - No, no, no, I'm fine. I'm fine, I'm about as well as it could be expected. Yeah. For a guy, that just discovered that - his wife is with his best friend. - Yeah. - You're at the party! - I am at the party. I got home, I got to my appartment and I was wondering why Connie's infidelity didn't wound me as deeply as it should. I kept thinking about, I remembered what you said about my movies. And I thought, my God, why is Ashleigh's approbation is so meanigful to me? Really, it was. And it strucked me, it stricked me. You and I were thrown together. We were trying to find a wandering rogue Roland Pollard. We had an adventure together. And in the movie version. In my movie version, the guy who looks up and he realises he's fallen in love with the girl. - I've played that role so many times. - Writers like this does not come along... - Hi. - Hey. I'm going to call Sam if you don't answer me by Friday. Yes, alright, ciao. - I'm sorry, it took me so long. - It's so funny. My father would always say when drinking you should never mix grain and grape together. But I think they go really good. I think we should split. We should split? Gatsby, if you always intended to come you should've told us. You know I am not fond of surprises. Mother, Dad, this is my girlfriend Ashleigh Enright. Hi, how are you? - How lovely to meet you, Ashleigh. - You too. - One's a pleasure. - Hi, how are you? - I'm well, thanks. - Nice to meet you. - I've done business with your father. - Yes, he speaks very highly of you. Actually, I've never met him, it's his bank. Yes, he's got so many banks. How are things at Yardley? It's very quiet, we get a lot of snow in the winter, that sort of thing. Very rural, but I chose it because they have a great Kurdish studies program, yes. Have you thought more about the career? Your father was bemoaning the fact that you are still undecided. I have, Leonard. I want to go into nuclear physics and maybe open a little store and sell dark matter. He's kidding you. No. He likes to sit at the piano and sing, and play blackjack. And when you were a boy, your mother wanted you to be a concert pianist. She always had big plans for me. How about you, Ashleigh? What are your plans? - She wants to be a journalist, actually. - TV or print? - Political stuff, she'll report from all of the... - TV, I'd like to do the weather. Troubled spots. On the weather. Right. You've been staring at Ashleigh all night long, is there something wrong? There is something about that girl. She's quite pretty. And sophisticated for a young girl. Come on in. - Look at this place. - Nice, isn't it? What was that all about with Ted Davidoff and Rollie Pollard? We were just talking. Yeah? Alright. Don't worry. I'm sure they are very interested in that story you are writing. Today has been quite a story. And that's just the beginning. Please, sit down. Relax. This is really amazing. She's very charming. And hot, you didn't say Ashleigh was hot. - I told you she was sexy. - Is she older than you? She looks older. That's what you want, a little experience. You have to grow up and have a profession. You think a girl like that wants to live hand to mouth. Funny you should put it that way. Keep your hand on the wheel, Ashleigh. He obviously wants to go to bed with you. How do you feel about this? You have a boyfriend. Yes, but... This is Francisco Vega. Apart from him, being so sexy. He's an international icon. Mahatma Gandhi. How can you say no? This is the story you can tell your grandchildren. May I show you upstairs? Sure. If you liked it here, you're going to love it over there. Okay. I got us some whiskey. Is this where you sleep? Yeah, when I sleep. You can see the whole apartment from here, it's quite special. - Nice. - Yeah, I know. I know. Let me help you. Look at you. Who the hell is that? Give me a sec. - Yes? - It's Tiffany! I'm home! I thought you two weren't together anymore. No, we... Oh no! Wait a second. It's going to be fine. You said that you weren't together anymore. Yeah, I know... You know what, you have to hide there. Go behind that door. Go, she can't see you. Go. - Surprise! Hi! - What are you doing here? We wrapped 2 days early. I'm so glad you are home it's starting to pour. I just got off the plane. I bet you weren't expecting me. I'm loving this. Fransciso, why are you... What are you doing running around? Getting ready for you. Welcome back. I just got off the plane. We wrapped 2 days early. I came right from airport. I knew If I'm being surprise I'll arouse you. Baby. I've missed you. Yeah, me too. I've missed you too. What was that? - I didn't hear anything. - I'm sure I heard something. - Baby. - One sec. Come back, that was nothing. Excuse me, which way the Waldorfl is? What's on your mind, mother? I want to have a word with you. No, no. Please don't do this to me tonight, mom. I'm not really in the mood for one of your tete-a-tete's where I come out on the short end as always. I really couldn't take it tonight. Okay? Where is Ashleigh? - I asked her to leave. - What? Why? Don't give me that Ashleigh bullshit. I smelled hooker the second she walked through the door. Mother, do you hear yourself? Damn right I hear myself. I'm shoked. Okay, I apologise. I met her in the bar at Carlyle and I gave her five thousand bucks to pretend she was Ashleigh, who has dumped me. Five thousand?! It was worth that much for you to make a fool of your father and me? I was in a bad mood, it was my idea of a joke. So it was a bad joke, okay? I won a lot in a card game, so... It was an act of rebellion. - It was an act of hostility. - Hostility and rebellion. Rebellion against what? Private schools, a nice home, summers in Europe? Against a life of pretentious appropriateness: appropriate friends, appropriate schools, appropriate women, that you may or may not approve of. You resent me because I set a high bar. Mother, I don't resent you because you set a high bar. I just want you to see me. I'm never going to be like Hunter. I'm not going to roll off the assembly line and make you proud. You lied to me when you said that you were too busy to come to my party. That you were too busy at work, snowed under at Yardley. I did lie to you, because I didn't want to come to your party, alright? I wanted to spend the day with Ashleigh in the city and have a great time. Where is Ashleigh? I told you she dumped me. We became separated. This city has its own agenda. And your rage with me is so great that you express it by bringing home a whore? An escort, Mother. Let's not split pubic hairs. Anything to shake up that collection of appropriate snobs. So you bring her to my gala as your girlfriend to make a fool of me? I'm sorry. I don't know why I'm like this. I don't know where I get this perverse streak in my system from. I don't know. You get it from me. I get it from you, the queen of good taste? Alright. You're a big enough boy to hear the whole inappropriate story. I met your father, in the exact same line of work. An escort service. Or more to the point: hooking. As that working girl you tried to slip pass us as Ashleigh Enright. What? Lower your eyebrows. I knocked on your father's hotel room door because that's how I made my living. Fresh from Gary, Indiana. Providing the lonely male of the species with a little casual recreation. For a fee. Except in you father's case we fell in love. And not only do we marry. Winston used my hardened nest egg to start the company that has enabled us to live a pretty privileged life. You following? Or am I going too fast? And I put myself through school, so my brilliant young son can laugh at my pretentious. What I'm saying is that, if I have been to over too far in my pursuit of the finer things and of cultivating an image. If I have caused you some discomfort. It's only an overzealous ex-professional hustler from the mid west, trying to erradicate unsavory remnants of many hotel rooms I still wake up screaming over. And if you can't understand where you get your mysterious urge to consort with a demi-monde. You have my genes. And I'm sorry to lay this X-rated tale on my sweet college boy, but something tells me that the time is right. Just put on the chairs and then we done, alright? - Hey, Gatsby. - Hey, Johnny. I saw you on television. Nothing happened. I'm really exhausted. I've been walking forever. And then I got lost on the train. Ashleigh, you were with a famous movie star. But nothing happened. I'd love to believe you. Just too many drinks, too much weed. I'm just a little too tired to explain. Tomorrow, I promise, but really Gatsby, nothing happened. Take off your rain coat, I'm going to get you some black coffee. I can't, I have no clothes underneath. So with Roland Pollard it was like a spiritual thing. I was his muse, some inspiration because he's... Really going through a rough creative period. And also, my name is totally the same as his first wife's. Who also went to Yardley. Who he's never really gotten over. And then Ted Davidoff. He was just absolutely traumatized by this affair his wife was having with his best friend. And there I was, you know. Just a person there to talk to, to hold his hand, during the crisis. What about Francisco Vega? Like James Dean, minus the acting chops? Francisco Vega was just after my body. But I was onto him. And I have a terrific material for a hot story. I dated a hunk. What about you? How was going to your Mom's fahrey? It was pretty nice, actually. We got in a sort of a crazy conversation. For the first time in my life she surprised me in a good way. Now I feel closer to her. Must have been a big talk. What did you discuss? The oldest profession. Journalism? That's the second oldest. Let's put it in this way, she's a lot more than I gave her credit for. I sold her short. What a shame we never got to take that carriage ride. We can still do it. We have plenty of time, we can get it in. Said the John to my mom. - What? - Nothing. We should probably leave our luggage downstairs. As you know I'd hate to miss our bus back to Yardley. New York on a misty day. I can't tell why it means something to me, but it means everything. It's only one carriage ride and the weather's gloomy. I couldn't really sleep last night. Did you hear all those fire engines? I did. The roaring traffic's boom. Silence in my lonely room. I know that! That's from Shakespeare, right? Sir, would you stop for a second? - Why are we stoping? - Ashleigh, you go back to Yardley. - I'm going to stay in New York. - What? I need a carbon monoxide to survive. - What are you talking about? - We are two different creatures, right? You like the sound of crickets and I like the rattle of the taxies. You blosom in the sun and me... I come into my own under grey skies. You were a big hit here, you are a crackerjack reporter. You were loved spiritually, emotionally and physically by 3 gifted men, right? - Yeah. - You don't want to be with me. You deserve better than I am. Are you dropping out of Yardley? If I won't sound to pretentious: I want to review my other options. Excuse me, sir, do you think it's possible to take her to Pierre hotel? - Gatsby, I do not understand. - You take this. Just take this. Get your luggage and return to Yardley. So you're not coming back to Yardley? I don't know Ash, I have to figure some stuff out of my life. Have a great trip and you tell everybody at Yardley I said goodbye. So you're not coming back to Yardley? Gatsby. Wait, sir, I'm... Gatsby, I don't understand. Could you hurry? I think it's starting to rain. How did I know you'd be here. You didn't think I was going to blow this moment, did you? What about the skin doctor? Very handsome, very rich and very clever, but I'm here. For a kiss that was a maximum of an eight? It's fall. By spring I'll have you up to 10.
