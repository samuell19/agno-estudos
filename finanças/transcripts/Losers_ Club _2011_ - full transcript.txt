Whether you stand before or don't stand at all. Sometimes colorless and pure water flows beside the road. In that water, there are fish too. It is possible that the hills cut by the road maybe green soil ...or beige. The water do not turn into the color where it passes, but it may seem to you so. As well... ...the road, do not end.

But I always think that... ...life is formed of not able to be on right time and in right place. [METE] I think life is formed also being in wrong place at wrong time. More or less, same.

Goodnight beloved Kent listeners. Here is Losers Club. [METE] Falling in love is momentary. A moment that suddenly everything looks bright... ...the most pastel colors begin to turn hot... ...and all food taste better than ever. Man cannot decide to fall in love.

If someone says: Besiktas port, is it in Kadikoy or in Besiktas?... ...Besiktas? I have nothing to do with port. Ask to Erol Egemen. Ok ok but which? I would understand Kad?k?y. Me too. I would in Be?iktas. Alo, alo. Go ahead respected listener. Dude, there is a nice lion documentory on tv. All right respected listener. And there is girl here named Ceyda, waiting for Mete. Better her to not wait, I will be late. OK, good luck. He will be late. Okey, turn on the radio. As I have said that I will be late. Last day I was early. How? Let me tell. It was a no different morning. There was an incredible storm outside. A thin raining started. I was sitting for a light breakfast, took my cofee... ...eating my matchbox big white cheese. "do you want coffee", i said. "yes" she said. She took her coffee, sit on a chair next to me. She was listening to the rain and never coming spring. I tend to the strawberry jam in front of me. I took a little with my spoon. When I was taking the spoon to my mouth, jam dropped on my neck. I moved to take it with my spoon, she held my hand. Pushed it away. Stared into my eyes. "Wait for the time" she said. With the tip her middle finger, she took the jam out of gutter on my neck . Took it to my lips. Slowly she spread the jam all over my lips. She slowly spread the leftovers to her lips. She made my lips wet with her hand. She tasted the jam. - What are they telling? ssshhh. Raining increased. Mixed with the wind. she turned to me, bended his head to me... ...touched her lips to mine. Smoothly... she tasted the jam on my lips. And I tasted her lips. Before she pull back her lips... ...one last time she touched with her tongue to mine. she licked my lips. Stood up. She pulled out the part of her white shirt inside the skirt. Without unbutton the shirt, she pulled it down to her breasts. She didnt wear bra. She turned me to herself. Slowly she removed her tshirt. Sit on my lap. Slowly, smoothly she touched her skin to mine. Her nipples touched my chest. She removed her skirt. Then... Then? "What happened" she said? What happened? eiaculazione precoce. Are you crazy? what happened? !!! You made phone sex almost to all istanbul. OK, I passed the idea of being banned... ...but you will take us all to jail. Dont exagerate. I told you before, I tell you one more time. Buras? T?rkiye. Stop this American Rock n Roll style of "I dont care anything" mentality! Ok... We can finish if you want. I dont say it but make conversations softer. You have far more things to do. Dont miss your chance. It is not matter of missing the chance. Let make it proffesionalise. I pay you per program, we will both be more comfortable. Not needed, we are good, ha? I guess you didnt get it, I will pay you money. I mean, Im fine like this. Me too. This way or that way you will get something. Okey. May I take it? Im writing Beer. Write whiskey too. - Cab. - Cab. - Meatballs. - Yes, meatballs. It would be enough if you pay Food, drink and transport. Even whiskey and beer would be a lot. Give it, maybe there is something she objects. Here. Okey. We forgot the chocalates. Fucking Jesus Christ. - When will we be at Kusbeyin? - At 8. Do you think we are stupid not asking for money? Could you tell a price to what we do? I mean... ...we have no fear to loose the program, si? We shouldnt be slaves for 50 cent. True. Are you sure it is the Besiktas port in Kadikoy? - Why you bothered this much. Not at all, always welcomed. Thanks for accepting my invite. It was very good Ku?beyin, thanks. At two different points on earth, they can blow the same breath. True. I got the book of Sturgeon you published. - "More than human" ? Very nice text, really. Yes but we will take it to storage room too. No one else than Kaan would publish that book. Then It is my luck, If you havent published I wouldnt read. Two things never change, you know? First the excitement when I prepare the books... ...and disappointment after I publish. - There is a janitor of the S?leymaniye Mosque. From Van. His father has came to Istanbul for job when he was little. When returning he took a photo of S?leymaniye for memory. Janitor is young at that times. They hanged the photo to the wall of their house. THe kid has looked at the photo every day for many hours. He has attached to that photo with a big passion. His ultimate goal has became to see that mosque. When he was at age of 20's he has came to Istanbul and he went directly to the Mosque. He has seen it. Sit in its garden, prayed inside. He couldnt leave. Then he has started to clean leaves around it. Took care of flowers without expecting anything. And Imam has noticed it... ...he decided to take him as janitor. There is a secret room at top levels of the mosque for janitor. Nobody knows that room except the janitor and imam. They have given this room to him. And they say, the best view of Istanbul is there. And to achieve to look from such a great view... ...was possible only with big passion. Eyvallah. Ku?beyin, we should go. Long way, to Kad?k?y. Kad?k?y is contrary, easy to go. By the way... ...that port should be the one in Kadikoy. Aint it? How did you know that I would be at correct port? I dont know. I guessed you will make it. So, you were that much sure? I wanted you to be sure. If you really wanted to see me again... ...I thought you would find a way. I got it, I mean... ...a kind of test. Absolutely. What do you do in life? Generally. I think you try to ask my job? Im an architect. I work for an international company called Work and Smith. Nice. Im interested in architecture. Since when? 4 days. Well, what do you do? I have a publish house. REally? - Which one? - Alt?k?rkbe? (6:45). I have some books of 6:45. Really? Which ones? "Enis Batur", "S?tte Ne ?ok Kan." And "Oru?

We are together since university, we both studied here. - Where are you from? - Edirne. - What do your sister do? - Pharmacist, anything else? Another queation? What do you do else? I take photos sometimes, if i have time. and also... I have a small radio program. How nice things you do. MY life seemed to me boring when I compared with yours. Everything routine is boring in fact. This is why neighbour's garden is always more green. Dont think. Yes but nothing can be stable which do not turn to routine. - Coffee? - Few Sugar. - Two coffee. - Yes Sir. Do you date a lot like this? Like this? Si. Never. - Abicim I will move if you take your bike. It's early, lets ride around. Whats up? Standart. I guess you were in the right port. Yes.. Ice Cream left? Yes I left some for you. - Are you kidding me bastard! Is this what you left for me? What, not enough? Because you dont like blackberry I ate it... ...this is the raspberry. You buy one time and we eat. How was the girl? Very different, good. - I mean, good. I havent met like this one for a long time. Anyway, I go to sleep. Dont drop on carpet. He is in love, not aware. Dont drop on carpet. Probably this is what I think the most. Nothing to loose is freedom. But who can achieve this, I dont know. Ee... ...year 1917 something. We are in Wien. There is our Karl. King? - Karl. - We call him King. Beardy. There is Friedrich. Friedrich has left his dad's factories... ...and came near us. We are there teorizing, at a top roof apartment. And I never forget. - We are drinking coffee. Eating donut. - Who is this Karl? German Footballer I guess. - I turned to Karl... - Karl Marx. Read some books. Karl Marx. ..."what else left to loose?" I said. Do you know what he said to me? "Nothing but our chains" he said. "Kaan", he said. Fuck off, I said. "You", I said, "you ruin this century with this mentality", I said.

Goodnight beloved listeners. What do they do? They record fake official tapes in case of inspection, Asl? Han?m. - Okey Usta. - Okey. - Do you know what came to my mind Mete? - What? Censure. Censure... I think everyone should be censured. Goverment should censure not only tvs, radios and newspapers... ...they should also censure magazines and thoughts. What happens if everyone has his own thought!? Are we crazy!? Censure agents should walk around. Really. They should punish thoughts too. Did he think woman? 1.000 Dolar. Did he think to have sex with that woman? 2.000 Dolar. Then we would make them rich. Listener on the line. - Alo. - Alo. Hi. Hello, respected listener. Have we slept before? No. How arbitrary question is this. Well, could you ask me a question which is not arbitrary respected listener? There is no such question. Anything which has no answer will not have its question neither respected listener. Questions exist only to hear the answer. Except one. This question can put you in deep silence or unbalanced joy. As I could understand from here, your already unbearable existance... ...can be worse for your periphery. I will ask if you are ready. Yes. If there is death What else could be more serious? Someone on line. - Goodnight respected listener. - Have we slept? Alo? Goodnight respected listener. Go ahead. My name is Hakan. I have been thinking to call you for a long time. But you encouraged me after I heard you tonight. Yes respected listener. Dont make it short. How shall I start... Im a painter. I live with my mom. In fact I was living. I lost her a year ago. We were very close. she helped me to start painting. There is no such sorrow... ...such a pain. I cant describe. I couldnt eat for months... ...couldnt sleep, couldnt paint. I couldnt resist anymore. I said: let me finish it and end this pain. Nobody will notice my absence, i said. I even planned how and when to do it. Maybe it will sound ridiculous to you but... ...I noticed your program one night before I would do it. I sit, and listened until the end. You were teasing with loneliness so good... ...then I decided to listen one more night. Without consciousness, I started waiting your program. While I was waiting, I had forgotten to die. I record the programs and listen also day time. - Not every program I guess? - Eh. There are few. In fact I called you to thank you. Eyvallah, respected listener. where are you calling from? Pendik. Then... ...we give you too... ...governer of Pendik Badness. Ofcourse, If you accept? I would be glad. Well Then. We are waiting your reports. Thank you for everything. Goodnight. Did Erol Egemen call? Who is he, he would call? Do we go to eat meatball? Lets go. - Do you come here everynight? - At least once a week. - Did you like? - Very nice. Why didnt you talk more with that guy who called? We did, what else we would talk? I dont know. He opened his heart, he thanked. You could treat more friendly at least. You think so. I dont get it. You dont know the value in your hands. why dont you take anything serious? Why do you always try to give mission to us? We are two men who gets pleasure of each others conversations and talking in radio. Thats it. I know it very well that you dont believe what you say. We didnt ask anyone to listen us. We didnt ask anyone to love this program. We didnt tell anyone to take us serious. But they did. What will you do now? We will go home after meatballs. Same. I dont understand it. Program is this much populer. We still cannot sell books. We should benefit of it. Kaan doesnt want to use the program. Honestly. This program changed my life. Saved me. Nobody guessed this would happen. This, What we are living will be over one day. We will seek these days. I dont know. Maybe something else starts. Our 68's is this I guess. - Birra? - H?-h?. - Hi, Kaan. - Hi. - How r you? - Fine. You? What time is it? 10. - Offf! Offf! - What happened? I need to meet moms. They were going to stop at me.

Am I the one who makes sex conversations every night? "Did we sleep ever, come to us, I lick you." Is this the program? We dont talk anything else? Do you? Fine, We dont. What if I introduce you to my dad? Then if he listens to you on radio What will I tell him? - Then dont introduce to your dad, why do you make it difficult? - You are-- the most smart and intelligent man I ever know. Why do you waste it? why dont you make something real? Hayda. At the beginning, everything I was doing, was exciting for you. Your books do not sell. You refuse to take money from radio. You take photos very rare. Why dont you make something real? You are not 19 any more! This is me babe, never hide it. Never told you lie. Never changed. If you are not happy, I mean... ...if Im not enough for you... ...get yourself fucked and go. Then? Nothing, she didnt smile. Never. Never... ...would smile. [KAAN] Everything that could be expected from a good sunset was there. All that live colors in the sky. A light breeze. Smell of her parfume. In that moment... ...if an anvil ... ...would fall down from sky could arrive to earth... ...in 9 days and 9 nights. I got the job offer from USA that I was expecting for a long time. Congragulations. I couldnt decide going or not. Why? It depends you too. If you say "Dont go"... ...I dont. We try here, but... You should say it. Say "Dont go". Can you say? Say "Dont go". In that moment if a bronze anvil... ...falls... ...from earth... ...it could reach in 9 days and nights... ...to her eyes. Long... ...lightless... ...cold moment. Really? Eyvallah. - Are you fine? - H?-h?. Im better now. Did you hear from Zeynep? We talked. She settled in USA. Rock'n'Roll, this and that... I was not aware how much in love I am. But it was not possible. Forget it. Do you know the feature of women? They fall in love with what makes you up... ...then they try to take it from you. - How is the shop? - Fine. Im thinking to focus on publish house. There are many books I want to publish. I Think its time for a change. What will we tell to Asl?? We find something. Whats up? Ceyda... ...she left me. You were together? We were in big love. You didnt notice? Forgive me. What is this? I said: lets have a dinner as two single friends. I bought ice cream too. Raspberry. I finished the translation. Are you allright? As you said: We are really lonesome. [METE] Is this fair? Is this justice? [KAAN] Come on Mete, give us a message of justice. [METE] What the fuck is justice? Is there justice? If there is justice today, what would they say? What would happen to us Kaanc?m. [KAAN] Come on give the message... It should include love and brotherhood. Give us a messsage, come on. WE should love with justice. We should love back who loves us. We should desire who desires us. Even if we dont desire, we should pretend as we desire... ...at least we should not say anything that night. haa you say : we should tolerate the pompa? We should tolerate. Maybe we love, i say, maybe in time. you say good. You say good. Look, my eyes are wet. I want justice! Look, Look at drops. Right here, for no reason. I want justice! You too, Kaanc?m, give us a message full of love and justice.
