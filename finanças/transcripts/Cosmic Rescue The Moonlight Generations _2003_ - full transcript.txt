It's 2048 AD. Space Development is on its way to becoming privatized, but with rapid expansion comes higher accident rates. To address this problem, the world's insurance agencies jointly fund and establish a global organization called "Cosmic Rescue". Cosmic Rescue continues to expand. Five years later... Cosmic Rescue, my foot! All we do is change batteries. They may as well call us "Battery Rescue"... Azuma, the mike is on. Huh? Tell us how you really feel. I didn't mean it! Well, not all of it... Yeah, yeah. You done changing the battery? Yeah, I'm done. l see some debris out there. Get that too. Mr. Nanjo, all we do is collect Brownie points by... Just get it. I can't take it...it's so small... Even small debris can cause a lot of damage. Not the debris! I'm talking about the scale of things. Isn't there something bigger and better than this? Like... Over and out. Yeah, like over and out... Hey! I'm back. You kicked the air mobile again. It's acting up. It acts up because you kick it! You have to love the machines. And the debris collection. This ship is so full of love, I'm suffocating! Love the machines, love the debris. I'm so privileged to be a part of so much love. Do you know how long it takes to clean the air of tobacco smoke? What happened to the air cleaner? It broke yesterday, remember? Everything is fine now. CR is here! "Saving lives...that's what I'm all about." You're always in the escape pod. I can focus in here. Focus on reading comics? I focus 100% on everything l do! Then focus on your work! Check the engine, fix the meter, and clean up! There are a million things to do. I'm the only one working around here. Mr. Eguchi, can you have a word with Mr. Nanjo? I've been here a year and all I've "rescued" is debris. I told you...accident prevention is a part of our job. What if we collided with one of those debris? A fragile ship would be blown to bits. Like this "lemon" here? Watch it. The mentality around here is so uninspiring! Other teams are out there rescuing lives! Look! Even Mr. Nanjo was a star rescuer once. Not that comic book again... Comics always exaggerate. Things aren't like that in real life. Cosmic debris collides with a private ship in orbit. NanJo and his partner Sosuke Chiba rescue everyone aboard, but are left stranded themselves with only one escape pod left. Sosuke, you go on... You have to live... Nanjo gives up the last escape pod to his partner... And then, when Nanjo miraculously survives the disaster, check out his line right here! "Saving lives...that's what I'm all about." Could anyone but Nanjo get away with such a cool line?! You couldn't hear me? I'll say it again... "Saving lives..." Make yourself all about cleaning up, OK? l want this place spotless. But you aren't getting it! I'm talking about the great Nanjo - the valiant hero! Who no longer exists... Mr. Nanjo's rescue was so legendary that he became a comic book hero. All of us at CR idolized him. But now, he's so detached... all he does is collect cosmic debris... I, Ryo Eguchi, maintain the machinery on a daily basis in order to keep old ships like these up and running. Service the engine, repair the meter... I'm the only busy one on this ship. And Azuma Sawada... a rookie who became a CR inspired by Nanjo, the comic book hero. He lives his life vicariously through the comics in a fantasy world where he's the hero... But things changed dramatically. Our uneventful days took a sudden turn. Come to think of it... It all started with that solar flare... Solar flare warning. Not again. We've had a few lately. Hyper-activity on the sun's surface has created a solar flare. Their electromagnetic currents can be harmful to shuttle meters. Over there. Azuma, power off in that room. Expecting impact in 20 seconds. Prepare for imminent impact. Switch power off and prepare for imminent impact. Roger. Can you hear me? Someone! Can you hear me? Please! We need help! Hello! Can you hear me? I read you! What's the problem? Our ship's collided with debris and... Hello! Hello! Please hurry! My parents are both dead... Oh my God! Uh... this is Sawada of Cosmic Rescue 89th Division. Hold on tight, we're coming now! I'm scared... Don't worry. I'm coming for you. ...I'll be waiting. Watch it! Grade 1! Grade 1! We received a Grade 1 Emergency signal! When? Just now! Didn't l tell you to shut the power? I said it's a Grade 1! Confirm position! Eguchi, anything on the radar? It's for real! Is this it? Coordinates 240, 5551. I'm locking on to it... Main engine on standby. We're going on cruise control. OK! FRA9C. Booster at full throttle!! Run DH 200. RSS2 following. BFO on. Orbit operation engine, standby. Position control engine, standby. Main engine, ignition. Cruise on... Fire! That's my line! Isn't that... an off-limits space zone? We need permission to go there. No permission needed for a rescue. Who asked you?! Eguchi, how far are we? Mister Eguchi, you mean! I'm older than you remember? 1,500 miles. Age is irrelevant...speed up! Call me Mister! Stop arguing! Mr. NanJo, from what l saw, they're really in trouble. We may need backup. Any rescue boats nearby? We're the closest to the signal. I guess it's up to us then! 1,200 miles and closing. Azuma, what about our engine? No problem whatsoever! We're low on fuel! We're going too fast, engineer. 600 miles and closing. Realign 6 degrees. Terminate FREQ. Confirm access code. Remove PT pod. Engine #2 on spare tank. Azuma, slow down! The engine sounds funny! Check out the meter! We're burning up! I'm fired up too, Mr. Eguchi! The engine, stupid! Hey! What happened? It's gone! What's gone? The ship disappeared! What?! Engine's down to 10% capacity. What do you mean "down"? We've overheated! The signal disappeared? They didn't blow up, did they? I didn't see a flash... Maybe it was just debris... So who signaled you, Azuma? A girl... A what? Give me a break... No, l mean it! In the midst of a solar flare... The napping comic book maniac... You've got to believe me! The signal originated from right about here... Yeah, right. What are you all mad about? I swear that... What's that? That's the remains of the #3 Space Station... So much debris... Could the signal have come from there? #3 Space Station was destroyed 4 years ago... So the girl you saw... Something's coming!! What? It's a patrol ship! We'd better dock. This is an off-limits zone. What are you doing? We received a Grade 1 Emergency Rescue Signal. Rescue signal? There wasn't any rescue signal. What's your division? Japan Chapter, 89th Division. I swear l received a signal. it was an emergency! I see your license is expired. And no maintenance checks in the last 10 months! We'll have to escort you to Moon Base. Hold on a minute! Greetings. This is Saejima, Director General of the Japan Moon Base Development Agency. The Moon Base construction is progressing on schedule. We are seven years into the project, which is currently 43% completed. The construction of this Moon Base will be a vital step in our expansion to Mars. We would like to announce the "2nd Phase Noah Project" which will construct a space station and send a search ship to Mars. Ladies and gentlemen, let us embark together on our dream to conquer space. We must overcome our tragic accident of 4 years ago and not waste any more time in establishing our Base. Mars is our future! You again? Expired license, neglected maintenance AND a trespassing violation? I'll be waiting for your report. But we received a Grade 1 Rescue signal. There has been no such report. But that can't be! Sawada, you need to get a medical check. But the Grade 1 Emergency! Zero gravity is especially hard on your bones in the first year. Get to the clinic, now! And Eguchi, you've neglected your duty as the ship's mechanic. With all your illegal parts? You're really pushing it. But they're all usable parts! Why they insist on using new parts... when the old ones are perfectly good... That's not the point. Rules are rules. That will be all. Hey, don't touch that! This flare bomb is going too far. This is for military use, right? A junk ship like this makes the whole dock look bad. At least use this vacuum cleaner on the exterior. Hey! Azuma. OK, OK, I'll do it. Azuma, show some love! What's with him? Reporting a Grade 1 Emergency rescue signal received 20 hours ago! Hey, wait your turn... Now about this wiring... I think a Grade 1 has a bit more priority here. Grade 1? We haven't received any rescue signals. He hasn't received it, OK? Now about this wiring... That's not under our jurisdiction. Then whose jurisdiction is it? Around the #3 Space Station... Get lost! #3 Space Station? That's off-limits. There's no one there - only debris. But l spoke to a girl - she was in her teens, probably the sole survivor. We should investigate immediately. Maybe it was a... you know. A what? I've heard there's ghost ships out there amongst the debris. You probably made "contact" with one of them... No, really! Take a look at the Log Book. l think my battery needs changing... It's coming up, right here! Gee, you were so sure of yourself... It's coming up, right here! Let's go get some food. There's a new special at the community bar. Crab pasta. I love crab! Wait a minute! Where'd it go? You are the only one that's seen her. You don't believe me either? This is wrong. Do it over. Anyways, you were sleeping. You must've dreamt it. What? And it disappeared, right? It's probably the remains of a satellite. What do you mean? It was never a ship in the first place. The remains of a stealth satellite that doesn't normally show up on radar somehow appears, then disappears. Then what about the girl? It must have been... a ghost. It wasn't! That was gross. It was definitely a Grade 1! Hmmm. What do you mean, "hmmm"? Keep it down! Waitress! Crab pasta, please. Sure. One crab pasta! Eguchi's right. lt must have been a military satellite. The remains of a stealth ship appears, then disappears... End of story. But what about the girl? Keep it down! This is definitely not mom's home cooking... and where's the crab? Right here. Oops, forgot. "Crab flakes" And where'd the log go? Something's fishy. It was a ghost, I'm telling you. It wasn't!! I said keep it down! Not bad! You look busy. Kaori. I heard. You're going to lose your rescue license if you keep this up. Then what will you do? I'm so touched that you care. I'm trying to recruit you. You can join our team if you lose your job. Our janitor just retired. You like menial tasks, right? The hero's going to clean our ship? What a waste! Wait, maybe he'll be in a new comic... Nanjo, the valiant janitor. I like that! Let's go. Mr. Nanjo! Those guys... ...even had their own janitor? This is the Chiba residence. l am unable to take your call. Please leave a message. Will you look into it at least? Drop it already! You stay out of it! What? Just take a look at the prints...the wiring. Please! Just check out that area. We're busy here. You're in Nanjo's crew, right? Go pick up some debris. No fighting on base! There's a troublemaker, l see. He claims he received an SOS signal. That team's broken regulations left and right. Has a bad track record, too. Yes, they are notorious. Dismiss them. Dismiss them, sir? Send them back to earth. They could be a liability out here. But a dismissal requires certain steps... Just get it over with. It's totally justifiable. I didn't come here to waste my time on this. And get rid of this accident report. I have to return to earth soon. Clear this all up before l leave. Ouch! What's this? You're breaking it! You're fine. Your bones take a beating the first year in space. Take lots of calcium. Here's an extra heavy calcium dose. CR 89th Division. Nanjo, Eguchi, Sawada, report to Administration immediately. Hey, you have to sign off! Under clause 92, your ship has not been properly maintained. Under clause 22, illegal alterations of parts is in direct contradiction with international Space Insurance Regulations. As a result, the headquarters has taken a decision. Cosmic Rescue Division 89, you are all... dismissed from duty. Dismissed?! Your ship will be dismantled. Just give me one day and I'll have the ship back to standard! That's beside the point. But you just said to submit a report. This decision is final. You mean we're... After medical checks, you'll be returning to earth. Your ship will be dismantled in 24 hours. Remove your belongings. That will be all. Officer Tachibana. Can you investigate a bit further? This case? The Grade 1 Emergency signal! Get over it! That was... But l saw it! l talked to her! She said, "help us". I wasn't dreaming. There was no such signal. But she's alive out there, somewhere. Why can't you just let it go? I promised her. I promised we'd rescue her. We're all about saving lives... ...right? Your dismissal came from high up. Your investigating any further would be against regulations. Before this assignment... when l was in training... I experienced one rescue... a spaceship caught fire. I didn't do much, just helped carry the injured on stretchers. But the ship's mechanic was really burnt badly. Just as he was losing consciousness, he said to me... "Always take care of your ship". And a few years later, look at where that got you. I don't care. l don't regret a thing I've done... You really don't regret anything? Mr. Nanjo! That guy... What's this? Take it. So you've given up, just like that? You used to stand up to the authorities! You can't bring back the dead! A solar flare will be passing shortly... All electrical power will be turned off temporarily. Be quiet! You just swallowed Tryhedolen 2042. If you don't take this antidote, you're dead! Bullshit! Fine, I'll take it all. OK! OK! What do you want? Where's your patrol ship? How long are you going to live in the past? The past? It's not the past to me. I just want you back as you were... It's here! Someone help us... Can you hear me? This is it! Hello! Our ship's collided with debris and... Hurry... I'll save you. I've taken care of the troublemaker. Yes. The survivor is in "275". The survivor is in "275". Who are you? It's you... If memory serves me, your team was formally dismissed. You are no longer Cosmic Rescue. I just wanted to save that girl. We've taken care of her. Forget it. Wait... One crab pasta! Oh my God! Hey, you can't put aluminum foil in the microwave! I'm sorry... but why not? Why not? Do that again! The microwaves repel the aluminum and... l got it! This is the image of the solar flare which occurred 23 hours ago. It seems part of the remains of #3 Space Station has begun shifting. Shifting debris is very likely to cause accidents... Officer Tachibana? Yes? Are you OK? Order retrieval of whatever entered the alert area. Yes, ma'am. What's with her? Hey Yoshi, Don't forget the orbit calculations. I'm doing it now. You're always late. Yoshi's slow on the computer. It's the computer that's slow! I wanted you to have this before l left. This is it...! Estimated route of debris. How come I'm the only one without an intel? Hey. I turned it off for a minute. Tell me first! Eguchi! I have a question. Officer Tachibana. If Azuma really did receive the Grade 1 Emergency signal, it was only 23 hours ago. And we get dismissed immediately afterwards. Something's not right. I already told you the reasons for your dismissal. Yeah, about 100 reasons. But it all stems from our trespassing on the off-limits zone, yet you won't even investigate the ship that disappeared from the radar! But a ship couldn't just disappear from the radar. That's right, it couldn't. So someone must have hidden it. Look... l found a lot of this on our ship. 23 hours ago, someone got to the distressed ship before us and covered it in these aluminum chips. That repelled the radar's electronic waves and the ship disappears from our screen. Before we get there, someone dismantled the ship and destroyed it. Azuma did receive a Grade 1 Emergency signal. And an accident did take place. But who would do such a thing? And why? Officer Tachibana, l know you are an honest person. How would you know? Because... I'm leaving for earth soon, but l need to discuss a few things first... Why is this still here? We can't afford any leaks about the accident. I have some issues to clear up as well. Please follow me. Excuse me. What is it? Can l have some water? l need to take my medicine. Wait there. Don't try anything funny. Take this! This is Ketrozine 23-B. If you don't take this antidote, you're dead! Electrical maintenance! Move it! You're in the way. Who's in whose way? Call Mr. Naka! Mr. Nanjo, l got it! l got the image of the girl on disk! And Saejima's in the background! It's all a conspiracy... Saejima's got the girl! Azuma! We aren't Cosmic Rescue anymore. What do you mean? Didn't you say? "Saving lives... that's what I'm all about?" I never said that. I said, "if I'm not saving lives... I'm worthless". Don't waste your breath on him. You are worthless now. A Cosmic Rescue - who can't even rescue. Worthless. I've heard about it enough! Let go of me! Wait! Wait! Watch your hands! 275? The survivor is in "275". It's you! You're in on it with Saejima! There you are! Here it is! You really can focus in here. Cut the excuses. Just find it! The ship is ready. That girl is being held in Ship 275. That Saejima... It all started 4 years ago. #3 Space Station exploded. That accident was a result of Saejima's forced expansion. Saejima neglected his duty to follow up on the accident. To this day, the remains of the Space Station is just left out there. That bastard! And 2 years ago... A private ship collided with the wreckage... the rescuers were... Satoshi Nanjo and Sosuke Chiba! Nanjo and Chiba rescued everyone but the ship continued exploding. There was only one escape pod left... Let's toss a coin. That's fair. It's the only way. You go on... You have to live... This heroic act became a legend. Farewell, Sosuke. But the story doesn't end there. Sosuke, who Nanjo sent off in the last escape pod, ...died. Died? But l heard he escaped. That pod was never recovered. Ironically Nanjo was rescued right after that. NanJo withdrew from the front line of Cosmic Rescue. He believes he killed his partner... even now. He can't get over it. Is it possible for an escape pod to disappear? What if...Saejima wanted to clear himself of the responsibility ...then survivors would be an "inconvenience"... And Sosuke Chiba may have been left for dead... And if so... That girl's in danger! Azuma, wait! In any case, just hurry up and finish the job. You can't just "hurry up" and build a base on the moon. Do you think we're just twiddling our thumbs here? I didn't say that! All right, you guys. I can't work like this! Hey, Azuma. You're all right. Kaneda! Your ineptitude just means more work for me. I'm sorry, sir. l didn't expect any survivors and... And...? The 89th Division to trespass there. Never mind, I'm sick of your excuses. Sir, l know I've only been here a year... Unlike my predecessor... But according to the report, the remains of #3 Space Station is moving. I know I'm in no position to question the Government's policies, but if left unattended... Tachibana, you are absolutely right. You are in no position to question anything. But the wreckage you created... I created? Yes, you've totally neglected the wreckage. And the Moon Base construction project has picked up the bill. Tachibana, Space development is a costly undertaking. If we keep throwing money at the past, we'll never realize our future. But as a result, an accident occurred 2 years ago and cost a rescue crew his life. And this time... Officer Tachibana. And this time, private citizens have lost their lives! Don't you get it? With progress comes sacrifice. You bastard! Saejima! You're going down! Wait for me, I'm going to rescue you! It's time. Prepare for take off. What are you waiting for? Azuma, over here! The wiring's all wrong. Let me do my job. Progress is not made without risks. World wars, nuclear and space development. The sacrifices resulting from such crises accumulate, and become part of the program. Sacrifices are necessary byproducts of progress. My vision will pave the way. Space needs me! And l will lead the human race into space. Yoshi, what about the orbit calculations? Oops. What do you mean "oops"? There's debris headed straight for us! There's over 200, and countless smaller ones! This is the Chiba residence. I'm unable to take your call. Please leave a message. Hello, it's Nanjo. It's your son's birthday today, right? Did he get my present? I... What am l doing? Officer Tachibana... Please return to the CR Control Room immediately. Return to the Control Room immediately. Hey, what are you doing? Stop it! Officer Tachibana, over here! You get the radar screen on the main monitor! We can't avoid it! Then give orders to take cover! But there isn't room for everybody. This alarm... It's a solar flare! Switch over the radar's power source! We can't do that! Solar flare approaching. We're turning the power off. Calm down! They missed us! They missed us! They're going to hit the ship! More debris approaching! Dodge them! Ship 275 hit by debris! Dispatch a rescue team now! There's still tons of debris coming, we can't get near them! Rescue is impossible! Impossible? They're going to die! You're Cosmic Rescue. You go save them. We'll go! We'll go. But you're not Cosmic Rescue any more. Wait! Wait! Mr. Nanjo! Ship 275 is stranded 70 miles above the moon. Pilot Eba, her crew and Director General Saejima are on board. And that girl! The area is a storm of debris. Another direct hit and it's all over. What should we do? We go in for the rescue. Roger! Full throttle ahead! Main engine, standby. Radar search on! Booster engine, full throttle! The hatch is closed! Open the hatch! Permission to leave port is not granted. Disembark immediately. Then who's going up there? We'll wait for the debris to pass and send an official rescue crew. It'll be too late! Officer Tachibana, can you hear us? You've got to believe in us. You believe in people...l know. I could see it in your eyes. Please give the order! Let us go rescue them! CR 89th Division, Team Nanjo, l order you to rescue the stranded crew. We're counting on you. Open the hatch. But... Open it! It's stuck! I told you the wiring's all messed up. Hey, it's stuck! It's broken? Screw it! "Flare bomb" Azuma, increase speed! Main engine, increasing speed! Mr. Eguchi, lock on the radar. Target at altitude 68 miles. Distance 806 miles. Radar locked on Ship 275. Mr. Nanjo, you forgot something. We're coming... Let's go! Eguchi, the ship is in your hands. You bet. Can you stand? Where's the girl? Are you all right? Up here, quick! Kaori! Nanjo...looking good. Are you all right? Sorry, I'm late. You're fine now. Let's go. The connector's coming loose. Hurry! Azuma, let's go! Hurry! It's getting worse! Come on! You go on... You have to live... Azuma! "Emergency hatch" Azuma!! The engine pressure's too high. Their ship's going to blow! I'll go, Mr. Nanjo! You need to look after the ship, right? Please come back with Azuma. Don't worry, we're Cosmic Rescue! Oxygen level declining. Azuma!! Eguchi, do you read me? Eguchi, you can come get us now. That's Mister Eguchi to you! CR Control Room, this is the 89th Division rescue ship. Nanjo and Sawada are alive and well. Listen up everybody, you're listening to what will become Cosmic Rescue Sawada's legendary line. "Up here, in the dark outer space..." "I'm scared shitless!"Right? Hey, show me some respect! Sosuke... Chiba residence. Hello... Mr. Nanjo... It's been a while. Thank you for the birthday present... I found Sosuke's escape pod. You're still thinking of him? I just wanted to apologize to him... but l was saved again. I'm sure he wanted to tell you too ...that it's OK. Sohei! Say thank you for the present. Thank you! Sure. Thank you... This wasn't all my responsibility. I'm not saying risk is unavoidable in a project like this, but with progress comes sacrifices have to be made! I'm quitting as of next month. And do what?? Repent for my sins. You were just following his orders... You made me realize... that if I'm true to myself, l can believe in people too. And then l can learn to love someone too. It's OK. When are you returning to earth? Tomorrow. My uncle's coming for me. Get well real soon. See you. Wait... I'll never forget you... Never. Thank you. Wherever you are...if you need me, I'll be there. I'm back! Did you collect the debris? I thought we were through with the small stuff. Azuma, l told you. You have to love the debris collection. Yeah, show some love for your job. No smoking, either. Don't look at me like that! Are you ready? You bet! That's my line! You're only good for your big voice. I'm just trying to fire us up! Target identified. Booster, full throttle ahead! Radar, locked on target. Main engine, ignition! Cosmic Rescue 89th Division... Cruise on... ...FIRE!!! When gravity releases its hold on us, we humans feel a little helpless. Probably because we're all used to being held down by something. Thus we continue our job as Cosmic Rescue, so you never have to feel helpless. But never forget, if you can't save yourself, you can't save others. And, when you're in a bind, count on us to be there. Wherever you are... and that's a promise.
