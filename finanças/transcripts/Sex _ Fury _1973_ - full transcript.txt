MEIJI 38 (1905) Kanazawa Kanazawa Central Hotel Mr. Kurokawa, finally our Seishinkai group has gained dominance. You recently acceded the presidency of Seishinkai, Mr. Kurokawa. Your responsibility will be greater. It may be no exaggeration to say that Japan, which aims to become the top power in the world, has its future on your shoulders. Don't exaggerate, Mayor. Everyone in countryside politics is looking forward and expecting great things from you in the national political arena. Anyway, in the near future we, Seishinkai, will control everything. I am counting on you. Thank you. Your wife gets younger and prettier every time I see her. You must be joking. I'm practically a granny. - Not at all. - Right, honey? Mr. Kurokawa, a writer from the "Mancho" newspaper is here to see you. Crook! Die! - Catch him! - Stop him! Die! Call the police! Kurokawa! Catch him! Arrest him! Catch him! Where did he go? - Are you all right? - Yes. - Should we go to see a doctor? - No, I'm okay. Sir! Are you okay, sir? Lady, are you an agent of law enforcement? No, she saved me! Well, thank you. I am a butler at Hiiragi's. My name is Sanemaro Hitsujikawa. I truly thank you. Now, sir, we should get going. Thank you. So long. Force of habit. I've been doing this since I was a kid. My fingers are helpless. What is this? INAMURA FAMILY I have heard that story about the man in racketeering. But it's been 20 years. I've traveled to find that man. And I've heard a rumor that he stopped over in Kanazawa. A famous swindler who manipulates the game "Ino, Shika, Ocho"... Ocho, did you get your name Inoshika Ocho, from that man? Maybe. But there are feelings I've had all my life tied to these flower cards. I see. I have heard about you. Can I witness your highly skilled play, that which is rumored? Bet. Ocho. You can't cheat in front of me! Mr. Inamura, your gambling house allows this kind of disrespect? Of course not! How dare you sully my reputation! Boss, I was just... I didn't do anything. I don't need to hear excuses! Don't hesitate. Settle this in front of these gentlemen. Inamura! You... Let me go! He couldn't handle himself well enough. "Yuki Hosoya." Stay with me. Don't resent anybody. Hell waits right beneath the gambling mat. That's how it works. Damn Inamura. He was the one who made me cheat. - Inamura did? - How unfair. Is there anything you wish to declare? This bank statement... you must have reasons. Please, give this to my sister Yuki in Tokyo. Yuki... and where is she in Tokyo? In Asakusa. She left Kanazawa to work at Junikai-shita in Asakusa. Asakusa. Please. If I don't give this to my sister, she will be sold to a brothel for 500 yen! Could... you... please... give this bank statement to Yuki... Yuki... A cowardly sneak attack! Nobody can spread rumors, however small, about Inamura's gambling house. You have to die! ASAKUSA SEISHINKAI PRESIDENT KUROKAWA ATTACKED! OFFENDER WAS EX-MINYUKAI MEMBER You're... Thank you for all that trouble in Kanazawa. How are your injuries? Fortunately I'm all right. - Let me return this to you. - Why do you have this? She is beautiful. Sorry, but I managed to see. See you. I don't know who you are, but give it back now. - What are you talking about? - Come off it. I know all the tricks. If you're going to do it, do it better. You tend to be very popular among thieves. Move! See you. - Ocho, welcome back. - We're glad to see you. We were waiting a long time for you to come back. - Is she Ocho? - What's going on? No wonder she caught me. Ocho, her name is Hakonori Okinu. She just joined us today. - Nice to meet you. - Now, go study. Yes. I was expecting you today. Today is the anniversary of your father's death. It's because of your kindness to me as an orphan that I am here like this. Day by day, throughout my travels, I've always remembered it. Don't be such a stranger. I'm Ogin, the tailor. I'm your adopted mother. I'm just returning the kindness that Mr. Kasai showed me. Ocho, welcome back. Haru. You grew up. You look lovely. Only her body grew. She's still in school in Meguro. That's great. Boss! Ouch. I hurt my backside big time. I wonder if I'm still able to break wind. Yes, I did. It stinks! That's good. If it stinks, all is well. Boss, there's big news! I, Kanichi Hazama, have finally learned the secret art of stealing. Please look at this. Idiot, If you show that in public, you'll be arrested instantly. - Give me that. - Don't be so strict. Wow, she's gorgeous. When I see such a beautiful woman's face, my eyes almost pop out. Fool. Nothing could help you if your eyes popped more than now. Again, you like praising me, don't you? By the way, who is this? She is Ocho, my adopted daughter. Wow, I would love for her to be taking care of me. My little man hasn't been taken care of in a long time. Let me introduce myself. I am a student at the Ichiko school. My name is Kanichi Hazama. If you have time, would you like to walk the seashore in Atami? He's a lair. He was a boatman on a trash barge in Osaka. His name is Hachiro. I got this name, Kanichi Hazama, from a book called "Konjiki Sarumata." - No, it's pronounced "Konjiki Yasha" - That's right, Yasha. What is this? What is it? It looks like a western balloon. It's skinny and long. I took these from some female students. So it might be for girls. You guys don't know anything, do you? It's from England, It's a "rude sack". Rude sack? - It is called "condom" as well. - Condom? Western goods are elegant somehow. You're right. It's chic. How silly you are! It's a birth control device. I'm home! I stole it from her. How foolish you are. - Why? - She's our new girl, with us from today. If we steal from each other, we can't make a living. Yuki from Kanazawa? I don't know her. Only Kizugen takes care of girls for Junikai-shita. I heard that Heisuke took Yuki here. There're dozens and dozens of girls in this neighborhood. We don't know each one's background. Mr. Iwakura, welcome. Mr. Iwakura, how are you doing? How are you? I'm glad to hear that your business is doing well. Business is doing well, but I'm still only the owner of a whorehouse. - It's not much. - I see. I'm planning to have you help with more profitable work soon. Yes. The Tokyo Bay harbor construction will be contracted to us, Iwakura Construction. Tokyo Bay's harbor construction... it's a huge job. By the way, Kizugen, I am eager to see your great new beauty. Aren't you quite the playboy! Deflowering virgins is my hobby. People say, "Great men value sensuality." She is from Kanazawa. She has beautiful white skin and she's a real virgin. Sir, come with me. You are Yuki, right? Would you like one? Here. No, thank you. Don't be so nervous. Who are you? I am Ocho. I am here to redeem her. I brought 500 yen for her. It's too bad, but I'm not letting her go at any cost. Mr. Iwakura. Yuki's brother requested this of me. That's why I'm here. My brother? Please, Mr. Iwakura. You're pretty. Calluses from gambling. You're not making an honest living, are you? Well, why don't we settle this matter with a wager? - With a wager? - Yes. If you win, you take her with you. But if you lose, I will keep you both. I am the president of Iwakura Construction, Naozo Iwakura. I won't lie to you. Understood. With whom will I compete? She is the foremost gambler from a western country. She has blonde hair. A western female gambler? Tomorrow at 6:00 pm. The location: "Guinness," a foreign mansion in Shinbashi. Hello, everyone. Welcome and thank you for coming today. Let me introduce the number one most popular dancer in the stormy city of London, England: Christina. Call. Call. Call. Where's Kurokawa? Sir, let's go. Kurokawa must be here! Kurokawa! Kurokawa! Shoot him! What are you waiting for? Did you hear me? Christina, shoot him! Mr. Iwakura, as promised, you will let Yuki free. I understand. As promised, I will release her tomorrow at 12:00. Mr. Kurokawa, this way. Ocho, you're a very nice gambler. You're a gifted gambler, too. Between gamblers, there is trust and friendship that only other gamblers can understand. Isn't that right? I did it again. My old tricks. Old habits die hard. Then, I really can leave here? Yes, you can. But before that... No! I will check whether you're a real virgin or not. No, please stop! You are a real virgin. This elixir will make you a nymphomaniac over night. Look, your hips are trembling. Now your body has cravings. It's impossible for you to go without a man. I'm scared. Please forgive me! Help me! - Help me! - Yuki. - I'm scared. - What's wrong? Iwakura had his way with Yuki's body. A deer. He had a deer tattoo. A deer tattoo? Where did you see it? You saw the tattoo on Iwakura's back? I want to die! I don't want to live anymore! Yuki... don't speak such weak sentiments. Even my only brother has died, too... Yuki! You can die at any time, but there's only one chance at life. You have to live no matter how hard it is. This bank statement was your brother's last wish for you. He wanted you to be happy. At last I have come to this foreign country for your sake. The only possibility for me to come to Japan was to become an agent. And now, I have been to see you, but we couldn't exchange even a single word. Shunosuke... your fate has changed, too. Christina, our mission here is to make this barbaric country the stage for a second opium war. The first step is to trap a high ranking person in politics. You lost your pistol because you were so involved with your own being that you forgot about the job and the purpose that you were brought here for! Now your lesson begins! I'll teach you how to be a good and clever spy, young lady, for sure! Get this stuff off of you right now! Come on! The spy is not a human being, but a machine. A female spy can be a spy when she separates her body from her brain, and I have been doing all kinds of training. Only for your sake. Where are you, Shunosuke? Welcome. You're always beautiful. Mr. Iwakura, you're always busy. I won't be calm until the men who are after Mr. Kurokawa are arrested. Would you like to take a bath? Yes. Please. - Iwakura... - Yes? You still have a vice for chasing women? How about you? You must be too busy for it. I know about you and the young girl. Don't. Not here. When I see you, I can't control myself. - I guess Kurokawa has already noticed. - Really? Just kidding. But I sometimes feel he knows about us. Look... your body wants me so dearly. No, please don't. I wonder if "nymphomaniac" is the word for a person like you. I don't know... But because of you, Kurokawa and I could climb higher in the ranks. If Kurokawa didn't debauch you, then Kasai didn't need to die. And the evidence of the Seishinkai scandal would never have come my way, either. Selling that evidence was the start of yours and Kurokawa's careers. Yes. It's been 20 years now. Stop speaking of that old story. Your skin devours men. Your skin is fated to never be satisfied with only one man. It was a mistake for you to marry a cop. What's wrong? It's hard. It's time for you to forget. I want to die. Burn, burn! You can forget everything while you burn. Our members are severely injured. - We should wait for the right moment. - There's no time for us to wait. If we delay even a single day, they will dominate Japan. That's right! Shunosuke, if we fail completely, we'll be left with nothing. You seem rushed by your personal grudge. What's wrong with a personal grudge? My father was destroyed by their deceptive political plot. He was their scapegoat and he died of indignation! Commissioner, did you find Hiiragi and the others? We're in the midst of a full-fledged investigation. On my honor, we will apprehend them at any cost. Now with the Commissioner leading the investigation, we'll round them all up at once. Indeed. When politicians control a nation in a time of social upheaval, the police force is a necessity. I'm counting on you, Commissioner. Understood. Excuse me, sir. Commissioner, we found the assembly place of the dissidents. Good job. Arrest them immediately. They are criminals who enforce the will of the late Shusui Yukitoku. They cherish treason. It doesn't matter if they are killed. Get off me! Catch them all! Sorry! Let me hide. Come this way. Sorry. Did a man run in here to hide? - I don't know. - Search here. - Hey, do you have a warrant? - What? This place is for women only. I can't let anybody enter without permission. She's right. Men are not allowed to step foot in here. Who the hell are you? - Me? I'm gay. - Knock it off! I'll fight against Kurokawa... and his straw man Iwakura, until I defeat them, no matter what! In their previous incarnation they were Yakuza. 20 years ago, their urban railway scandal was revealed. And the political damage almost devastated Seishinkai. But right before the investigation reached the governor, they stole evidence from a detective. And they sold that evidence to Seishinkai. After that, they were able to climb the social ladder. - Any evidence? - Yes. Detective Tokuzo Kasai, who was investigating the scandal, was killed by men who planned to steal the evidence. - Is it the truth? - Yes, it is. The scandal and the corruption vaporized into thin air. They killed my father, who was the president of Minyukai, in the same way. Detective Kasai was my father. I heard that Iwakura had a deer tattoo on his back. Maybe my father's obsession permeated me. Hey, where is Ocho? How dare you enter my house with your shoes on! - Shut up! - You shut up! We can't leave empty handed. Ocho is harboring Hiiragi, who's in big trouble. We're with the police. Now go ahead and search inside! Boss, Ocho might be scared and flee. No. She will certainly come without question. I look forward to seeing her when she gets here. Tora! Hello, Mr. Kizugen. As you wished, I am here. Now let's talk. - Where's Shunosuke? - Before that, you must let my people go. Keep me instead. What? How interesting. Let them go. - Ocho! - Escape quickly! Stupid woman! How dare you? Ocho, I will take good care of you. If somebody needs to take care of me, I'd rather give my body to Mr. Iwakura, who's hiding back there. Well done. I will take care of you as you plead for mercy. A deer tattoo. It is rare. You can recognize the true value of the tattoo. Of course I can. At first sight. Ocho, why do you have this kind of tattoo? Wait. What's wrong? Let me apply some perfume. It's a girl's etiquette. Ocho... It smells good, doesn't it? You can go to heaven with this. Mr. Iwakura, it tastes good, doesn't it? You can go to hell soon. Detective Kasai is waiting for you. - Kasai? - Yes. You killed him 20 years ago. How do you know that? I am Tokuzo Kasai's daughter. Isn't that enough reason for you? The perfume you licked was deadly poison from Germany. Who is the third person who killed my father? Kurokawa, you and who? Who else? You will see soon. Look forward to it... Our country wants to know the secrets of the Japanese military as soon as possible. As you know, our country is very interested because Japan is a very important nation, and our country can benefit by this. Japan is getting very close to America. She is also trying to have England expelled from China. Further, she has just recently purchased a new battleship from France. We can't afford to waste any more time. Christina... well, I guess the time has come for you to start using your weapon. Weapon? I mean your body. When Kurokawa looks at you, you can see the hunger burning in his eyes. Anyone can tell what he desires most, but what I want you to do is, go to his house. Do and give him anything he wants. But get those secret documents. Do you understand me? This is a spy's fate. Shunosuke, where are you? I want to see you once again... once again. Opium is the best "Money Bill" next to war. You make money. And my business grows. Christina gives you her all to show our appreciation. How do you like this mansion? Do you like it? This place was designed with all the pleasures of modern civilization. You will discover what is waiting for you. She is Shinobu, she will take care of all of your needs. What's wrong, Yaeji? Iwakura was murdered! Who killed him? - A woman. - A woman? Who is she? Inoshika Ocho. Inoshika Ocho? Kizugen called me and said it must be her. What should we do? Don't panic. We have to keep our house on strict alert. Shunosuke? Where is Kurokawa? He has gone, just now. No, Shunosuke. You will be killed. I wanted to meet you once more. I wanted to meet you. Christina, but why are you here in Japan? I wanted to see you once again. I wanted to tell you what I did when you went home from Japan. I wanted to tell you that I was pregnant at that time. Pregnant? I couldn't even dance on the stage. A pregnant dancer... it's not even a comedy. I'm sorry. For you, your country is more important than a woman. I hated you. I damned you. I couldn't even have cared if I'd become a street girl. Shunosuke... you still have this? Please, Shunosuke, we can start again. I love you so very much. Forgive me. I must get only one thing done. I know what you must get done. It's Kurokawa's life, isn't it? But it's impossible to kill him now. But tomorrow, twelve noon, he will be on the train from Tokyo to Osaka. I will guard him then. Christina... Ocho, there was a boar tattoo on Kurokawa's back. - I saw it clearly with my own eyes. - As suspected. Kurokawa's previous life was a mystery before. And only you and I know the truth of the mystery. One man is a target of vengeance for the two of us... Ocho, please leave Kurokawa to me. - To defeat him is my mission. - No. It's my mission. Kyoko Kasai died. And at that time, I was reborn as Inoshika Ocho, To kill the Boar, Deer and Butterfly by my own hand is my fate. I've already defeated the Deer. Next is the Boar. And I will kill the Butterfly as well... someday. Kurokawa, die! Kurokawa! Kurokawa! Move! Ocho, I will kill you slowly... after I enjoy you fully. Inoshika Ocho. Your real name is Kyoko Kasai, right? How do you know that? I knew it. I knew from the first moment I saw you. Kyoko... you are... you are my daughter! Daughter? I'm sure it's hard to believe. We were apart for more than 18 years. I was a bad mother. But I've never forgotten about you. I knew this would happen. After all, you're just a lowly woman, too. She led the murderers to your father and ran away... leaving you behind. Hey, you! Take off your clothes, and show your stigma to your daughter as well. Otherwise, your daughter's life will be over. Now, do it! Kyoko, please forgive me. This man deceived me. I deceived? She's a bitch. And Ocho, this is your mother. She and I were not strangers before she married that poor detective. Kyoko, it's not true! I was scared. I was afraid of him! - Kyoto. - Don't touch me! You're not my mother. You're my enemy! I'll avenge my father's death. Kyoko! You know the secret. Now it's time for you to die. Die! Christina. Shunosuke. - Are you all right? - Yes, just a scratch. I was harbored at Ogin's in Asakusa. - And I received your letter. - I don't know anything about a letter. I see. This is a trap. It's dangerous. Christina! Your job as a spy is done. Also, your love affair is over, too. Do you understand, Christina? A spy must suspect the closest one. And you must die because you know our secrets! Christina, don't move! Shunosuke! Christina! Christina! Shunosuke. I love you, Shunosuke. Christina. Now, there's nothing to stand in your way. But don't let your guard down. Revolutionaries are always sprouting, even when you cut them down. We're on top of everything. The police department will take all possible measures to ensure your safety. End
