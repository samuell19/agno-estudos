No, no, no, no! Excuse me. I'm in. Let's see if you are. I'm out. Three Kings. Full House. Well played. - Another hand? - No, thanks. What do I owe? All together... 130,000. Do you have a light? Would you mind...? Poor old fellow. OUT OF ORDER - Going to Paris? - Yes. Get in. Thanks. I was starting to think I'd been abandoned. By who? Lady Luck. a film directed by Edouard Molinaro Peau d'espion based on the novel by Jacques Robert Adapted with additional dialogue by Jacques Robert and Edouard Molinaro Charles Beaulieu, your latest novel wasn't as well-received as the last. - Does that concern you? - It isn't unusual for writers. First comes a sense of denial, followed by doubt. And then there's the fear of being unable to reach the readers you wish to the most. You made Algeria the subject of your book. And like your subject, you avoid any hard conclusions. You seem to dislike political parties, institutions, religion... What I dislike are reassuring things. Being part of any group is a commitment to stay out of the cold. Safe among those who would protect you. To be alone, on the other hand, is harder but better. It's more honest. - Algeria was a commitment. - It was a war. Yet your protagonist experiences a certain joy after returning to being a soldier. Loneliness can be exhausting. There are times one must forget oneself and live for something else. War is a temptation. Do you miss the army? What I miss more are the readers. Well, you have your supporters. As well as critics. The book is The Violence of Summer published by Julliard. Were you at the studio? I knew you would be here. How nice. Don't you have other things to do than be my only fan? You don't seem to be doing well. Did you lose a lot? Not a lot. Just all I had left. Charles, don't be foolish. Take it. But I am foolish. And I can't take your money. Call it a loan. I can lend you money, can't I? No Sandra, please. I'll worry about you while I'm gone. - Are you going somewhere? - Yes, Germany on Tuesday. - Will you be gone long? - It depends on my husband. Harris is editing a special issue on Heidelberg. Do you want to come? - What? - Yes, come with us. You and I... with your husband? I don't like your tone or the implication. You're incredible. Absolutely incredible. I wonder how you justify all these clandestine meetings in that little head of yours. I've heard of unconsummated marriages, But we're in an unconsummated affair. Virtually unknown to Parisians. - Charles, please. - No wait... - Why did you pick me up on the road. - Out of pure charity. I'll accept that. But now you're offering me money and a trip to Heidelberg? That's more than charity, it's practically foreign aid to a developing nation. I need you, Charles. You're in luck. Because I need your car. - I'd expect a woman to do that... - We're being followed. Are you sure? Yes. The Jaguar. Oh, him again. Hang on. Is all this really necessary? No, but it's fun. - He's persistent. And still there. - Not for long. What's your problem? Be cool, cool. So who's the racer? Cecil, a young man who works for my husband. Harris is very jealous, as you know. One of these days, he'll give in to temptation - and commit a crime of passion. - Maybe I should ask for hazard pay. Did you say you want to be paid? I never said how. I told Harris to stop these stupid games. But he won't listen. Now it's his loss. You won't refuse me a drink, will you? Is that you, Charles? Yes, it's me, Madam Orel. You needn't bother. Not exactly what I expected. Now you see why I never asked you here before. Who is he? The Colonel. He left his widow only medals. and now she must rent rooms ...with dignity. It's cheap. Which suits me perfectly. Am I boring you? Why did you come here? I'm sorry, Charles. It's my fault. I wanted to prove that Harris doesn't own me. I'd say you proved he does. Am I wrong? Don't judge me, Charles. You don't know what I've been through. True. In fact, I know almost nothing about you. Perhaps it's just as well. Charles, tomorrow my husband is meeting some friends in Neuilly. Just the usual group but I'd like you to come. Somehow I doubt this is the right time. I want you to see the sort of life he makes me lead. Cecil must have turned in his report by now. That's just the point. Harris can't keep treating me like I'm some sort of investment. Help me. I don't like this type of game. It's messy. Are you afraid? A little, I admit. Maybe that's why I'll come. I would use the first one. - Good morning, madame. - Good morning. You prefer this one? So do I. Ah, the Egypt issue is out? Fresh off the press. I'll see to it, Harris. Hello Henri. Turning in your homework? A little too much. I have to make some cuts. Look at that cover. More antiques. It doesn't do justice to the magazine's title. The present and the future are up to us to manage. - I hope we'll see you tomorrow. - I wouldn't miss it. Where have you been, bitch? And again in French? I said, where have you just been? Ah, for a moment I thought I heard rude language. For the last time, where you have just been? Didn't Cecil report yet? Such a bad little boy. I spent the afternoon with Charles Beaulieu, the writer. - Do you know him? - Vaguely. You're going to know him better. - I've invited him over tomorrow night. - What did you just say? Now you listen to me, Harris. Either you stop interrogating me or I swear I'll file for divorce. I'll get started on that article. Particularly the start. Yeah, yeah, the start. Oh, thanks. Bastard. Charles... - You're soaking wet. - Yes, walking in rain does that. But I'm getting used to it. - Charles, may I present our informer? - Cecil, of course you know Charles. He only knows my back. That's the problem with tails. Here, this should help. Know me now? I'm also familiar with your writing. I loved The Violence of Summer. I don't like your Jaguar. If blondie touches me again, there'll be a murder here tonight. Oh and just when Cecil was trying to make friends. Besides, blondes aren't my type. Where is your husband? He always waits until everyone arrives before making his entrance. - You'll see. - Excuse me. How did he take Cecil's report? Very badly. But I stood my ground. - Who's that with him? - His current protege. - A scientist. - Good Evening His name is Henri Banck. A Doctor of Science, graduated at the top of his class in electronics... now he heads the Laser Research Team at the National Space Center for Missiles. - Is that all? - No. In fact, he first became known for his work on plasma techniques. He has a degree in Crystallography, spent two years at Harvard, and wrote a book entitled, Basic Research on Low Strength Lasers. - Oh, and he has a degree in Philosophy. - You should write about him. I did. A bio piece for the magazine. He's receiving an honorary doctorate at Heidelberg. That's why we're going. Uh-oh. Watch out. Excuse me. How are you doing? Mr. Beaulieu, my wife speaks a great deal about you. - She's beautiful, isn't she? - Quite. I have a project you'd be interested in. But I don't think Sandra would approve. I think you know that we're leaving for Germany. I would very much like for you to join us. Excuse me? At least it is better than meeting under bridges or at television stations. Don't you think? - Is that a job offer? - It is exactly. Excuse me a moment. Moranez! Moranez! Meet our new colleague, Mr. Beaulieu. Mr. Moranez is Chief Editor of my magazine, Futur. You can thank Sandra, Moranez. We needed a human touch for the Heidelberg issue. "The Scientist as Seen by the Poet" Sandra provided us with the poet. So do we have an deal? - Say 400 francs per page? - No, we don't. 500? It's not the money, it's a matter of pride. I don't like being kept on a leash. Anyhow, I'm couldn't. I'm starting a new book. Oh? What about? Jealousy. Well think about it. We're here until Tuesday. Call me. You disappoint me Charles. You're in no position to reject Harris's offer. True. But as long as I have the self-respect to turn him down, that makes me feel slightly less miserable. And tonight that's good. Good night. - Where are you going? - To bed. Protected by the Colonel. You remember him, don't you? - You're impossible. - Why? What did I do? - Your shoes. - What about them? They're brown. With a formal suit... Excuse me. Mr. Beaulieu, Mr. Banck. Hello. Thank you. Will you call me when I get back? What for? A bit of advice: Harris wants you to greet the other guests too. Go in friendship Charles. Care to repeat that outside? Oh an Alpha male? Nauseating. We're just kidding. Rome? Good god... Nimble as ever I see. - I had a good teacher. - Then show some respect. - How do I look? - Lean and mean. Thanks. If you only knew how I struggled to keep fit since I last saw you in Algeria. - Still a Captain? - No a Major. - Ah, still in the army then? - No I raise chickens in Sa√¥ne-et-Loire. "chickens"? I stay on the farm mostly but also keep an place outside Paris. Around here? No. I was looking for a cab when I saw you leave Harris Sphax's house. How do you know him? Somehow I doubt that he frequents chicken farms. I knew him in Cairo during the Suez affair. He screwed me over, I went to jail, and now I can never go to Egypt again. We're not exactly close friends. Taxi! Charles Beaulieu... Good to see you again. It may surprise you but it's good to see you too. So how are things going, between you and Mrs. Sphax? Something tells me you already know that. It was a mistake to turn down Sphax's offer. In your financial situation, it was foolish. Not to mention Heidelberg... Listen. Why don't you save us both some time. Just say what's on your mind. Oh, just a little favor. It's right here. The countryside is pretty, but its nice to come up to Paris once in awhile. Especially for Kiki, she's at that age. Is that you papa? Yes. Yes! In there. Oh I'm sorry. - You never said you had a daughter. - She's my wife. I'll take that. Gabrielle likes to call me that. She thinks it's cute. I know what you're thinking. I guess I should explain. No need. It's crystal clear. Did you meet Henri Banck? - I mostly heard about him. - He's quite exceptional. Sit down. But he's a problem. I'd like you to watch him for a while. - Would you get us two drinks, pussycat? - Coming! In Heidelberg. Are you with SDEC? Counterintelligence actually. At my age overseas missions are out. How about chicken farms? I manage. And not too badly, either. And what exactly troubles you about Banck? Me? Nothing. It's France that's worried. Oh "France," is it? Right. So now you're a patriot. That's a new one. Look, you fought in the war mostly for fun. So did I. But France is France. No matter what you say. Relax, no one's claiming otherwise. Then tell me, what exactly is "France" so worried about? That the Red Chinese will snatch Banck from us. So now its the Yellow Peril? You really go for cliches, don't you? Finished? Do you know who Banck is? Please. I've heard all about his resume. There are only a handful of men like him in the world. - Darling? - Right away! Do you know what he works on? Yes, lasers. And in 10, say 5 years maybe, all space communications will be using lasers. A single laser beam narrower than this flashlight, will transmit millions of messages over millions of kilometers and even be able to operate space vehicles remotely. Excuse me. Darling, this is Charles Beaulieu. My wife. Madam. I saw you on TV the other day. You were wonderful. Please turn that off. Is whisky alright? Certainly. - So what else? - That's it. The Chinese need experts in this field and since they can't be trained overnight... They'll snatch them wherever they can. Therefore Banck is surrounded by evil Chinese wanting to drag him back to Beijing. Is that it? Harris Sphax is grooming Banck. Wait. Did Sphax have slanted eyes? I should've looked more closely. Charles. Harris is a pro. He worked for Nasser and could work for Mao just as easily. If you would stop terrorizing yourself for just two short minutes you'd make the shocking discovery that Sphax is just another Gallimard only smaller. Gallimard went to Beijing, too. So did Malraux, but he's not in the Red Guards. I'm worried Charles. Sphax and Banck leave on Tuesday and I'm powerless to stop them because its an official trip. Once Banck's in Germany, we can't control him. Anything can happen. Here we are. Help yourselves. I'll leave you two. I go back to the farm tomorrow and if I don't get my eight hours... I'm the same way. I'm worthless without my eight hours. - Good night. - Good night. - 'Night, Darling. - 'Night. Shouldn't we go someplace else to talk? After we finish this. "What I dislike are reassuring things." "To be alone is harder but better. It's more honest." They say 5 million people tuned in to hear that drivel. Assuming there are that many fools with nothing better to do than listen to you rant like a loon. Let me tell you something. Better keep it to yourself. It will bring you luck. You'll need it. Listen, you won't believe this. That guy can't even afford to buy an oil pan for his car, yet he turns down a trip to Germany all expenses paid, because he's choosy! That's just plain rude. Ah, by all means. I'll be right over here. Care to dance? I'm leaving. It's going to get rough. You should never hit a woman. Problem? Oh miss... I'm so sorry Miss. Call me. Whenever you're able to read this. Excuse me. Oh Major... My poor Major. It can't be. - You're welcome. - Come on, Major, let's go home. You'd better save some of that energy. - For my job in Heidelberg? - I knew you'd accept! Almost like being back in the army, isn't it? Or maybe even better? It'll get you out of your head. Sure, things may pile up. But at least you don't have to ask yourself nagging questions. Happiness in slavery? No. L'esprit de corps. Just like you said on TV. Listen, Rome. I know you've saved my life twice. Once from Algerian bandits and again from a court martial. I know that. I welcome your support, but don't try to run my life. - I've got a job to do, that's all. - And a new wallet. with 3000 marks in it. Take a look. Was I right? To the penny. I've also opened an account for you at the German State Bank. How will I contact you? Once you're in Heidelberg, I'll contact you. And your affair with Mrs. Sphax... Well? Where does it stand now? A bit cool. Good. Saves me the trouble of telling you to suppress any desires for her. Is that an order? An emphatic suggestion. Sphax is a jealous man. I want to make sure he keeps you around. Alive, preferably. It's heavy but has excellent firepower. Bullets? Just five. To keep it light. That should be enough. You aren't going to war. I once knew this boy. He was dirty and ugly but he was the smartest kid around. Always reading math books. - Only now I know how lucky he was. - How so? Suppose you were born a scientist during the Renaissance. I would much rather have been born a poet or painter. It's the same with writers today. It is a matter of timing. Now it's better to be born a scientist. - Literature is finished. - I disagree. Someone once said, "There can be no science without conscience." You are our conscience. Men who write. [In German] Ladies and Gentlemen, We will be landing in a few minutes at Frankfurt Airport. Please extinguish your cigarettes and fasten your seatbelts. Flight 335 arriving from Paris Gate B. Dr. Banck is this your first time in Germany? Out of uniform, yes. How do you like Germany, out of uniform? I prefer it this way. Your mail, Mr. Sphax. The cars are ready. This is a lovely reception. I'm honored. Come on Henri, let's go. Excuse me. This should interest you. You can use it in your article. Charles... Banck... Egyptian Art Exhibition. "Here and today... begins a new epoch." - Who said that? - Goethe, when he entered Heidelberg. May I present Professor Belloum? Of course you already know Dr. Henri Banck. Thank you, Dear Harris. The exhibit opens tomorrow, thanks to you. Professor Belloum teaches Muslim Art History. And he wrote an excellent essay on Socialism in Islam. Though you flatter the Russians too much, perhaps. You forget it was the Russians who financed the Aswan Dam. After all, Socialism is the child of Russia. Since then it's been obliged to leave it's home. - For China? - China and elsewhere. Let's get back to the Pharaohs. You must excuse me. I had no idea of your political convictions. Yes I'm a Marxist. - But not pro-Soviet? - Not especially, no. I think I envy you. That's surprising considering your novels aren't very Socialistic. No, I envy your conviction. It's a type of passion. Or struggle, perhaps? Because isn't that what you're looking for? Tell me, isn't this a problem for you working at - the National Defense Center? - No. They are aware of it, of course. But I'm the one who's unsure. I'll be in the hotel all day. You can take the car. No thanks. Cities are best seen on foot. See you later. You're not shy. I'm only 50cm in your territory. Why so uptight? My husband is on his way up. If you don't leave this minute, I'll call for him. Got a good right, doesn't she? And she knows when to use it. I was a student here for two years. I know the city well. There are some quaint little houses in the Old Quarter. Sandra! What a wonderful surprise! It's been years since I've seen you. It's good to see you too, Frau Mueller. He must be French. - Extremely. - He's very handsome. I'll give you my best room. Number 8 on the 2nd floor. That's 50 marks. Thank you. And you're paying too? I must be dreaming. It's the real me, you know. Hello? Mr. Beaulieu? Your car is here. Car? A private car? Yes. The driver is waiting. Uh, fine. Thank you Mr. Sphax. Magnificent. One merely needs to pay the price. Banck! What are you doing here Professor? I'm head of the Welcoming Committee. This huge affair! How are you? I've just read your article. It's quite good. Thanks but actually my assistant wrote it. He's a good lad. And what are you working on now? Still the same, frequency control. If you get started on that now, we'll never make it on time. I'd like to take Dr. Banck with me. Let's hope the driver isn't interested in physics too. Your car Mr. Beaulieu. The Academy of Science. Where are you going? I said the Academy of Science. Or shall I break your neck? Professeur Genf, Nobel Lauriat in Physics, will introduce the great scientist being received at the University today. Yes? The professors of Heidelberg honor him... Welcome, Lieutenant Beaulieu. I'm Ludwig Brauner. He's the Father Superior here. I'll leave you gentlemen alone. Make yourselves at home. - When is morning mass? - At 6 a.m. Is he for real? We studied together but only he received the calling. - Does he know? - Not a thing. He just lent me his house. Why kidnap me like that? You could have called. I don't trust anything. Especially telephones. You should see a doctor about that. And tell him about seeing Chinese everywhere. Surely there must be a treatment. It's very nice here. And to think it was my bright idea to bring you in. - Naturally you didn't learn anything? - Oh don't say that. It's been a wonderful vacation. Civilized people, a wonderful city... - Yesterday we went to a concert. - Which I paid for. Oh, I almost forgot. Banck is a Communist. - Big surprise. - You knew? We have files too, you know. He joined the Party in 1952. Did you also know he is pro-China? Are you sure? It's no secret. He told me so himself. Of course that makes you ecstatic. Charles, listen. Banck is pro-China. Harris just returned from Beijing. Now the two are always together. Yeah. But one part of your theory doesn't fit. Everything is out in the open. Banck talked about China and Harris found it amusing. Where was this? At the exhibition organized by Professor Belloum. If you ask my opinion, I think Belloum is a spy. I once knew a Belloum. He was a fast on the draw and an excellent shot. It's worse than I thought. This isn't just a kidnapping case. Banck obviously wants to go. The others are merely to provide material or moral support. Things will move quickly. By tomorrow, the game will be over. Banck's not going back to France. There's someone out there. That's not your problem. Charles, get over to the Academy and don't let them out of your sight. - See you at the next kidnapping? - You weary me. If anything happens come straight here. Don't call. And Charles? Have you and Mrs. Sphax... Have we what? Remained cool? Of course. Those were the orders, right? Do I believe him? Probably not. They spent two hours together in a small hotel. Disappointed? It will pass. What do you have on Professor Belloum? Only that Harris lent him materials for his exhibition. The Belloum I knew was a close friend of Harris. It must be the same person. Still it's strange. They're acting as if Charles were part of their plan. Or that they believe him. Almost too much. Dear God. You don't suppose... What? We're changing our strategy. We'll tell Harris that Charles slept with his wife. - Why? - I want you to tell him tonight. But Harris will have him killed. Or keep treating him just as he has. Which would prove that we've been duped right from the start. These things must bore you. I thought you'd left us earlier. - Is Harris here? - No he's gone. He and Sandra are waiting for you at the Sabre. - And Banck? - Stuck here, I'm afraid. It's tough being a celebrity. I saw them coming out of a hotel this afternoon. I told Professor Belloum that you accepted his invitation. Oh that's right, Charles still doesn't know. We are all leaving tomorrow for Cairo. Cairo? You honor me by coming, Mr. Banck. We have a large mansion overlooking the Nile. Are you going Henri? Just for a few days. I called Paris, they won't miss me. Of course, Mr. Beaulieu, we want you to be our guest too. Well I'd like to but... Insist, Sandra. He'd never say no to you. Not feeling well, Moranez? No I'll be alright. I just need a moment. Excuse me. Cecil, take care of our friend. Gently. So Charles, are you coming? I want to hear what Sandra says. Come with us Charles. Since you asked with such conviction, I'd be delighted. Happy now, Harry? You've got your little group. I want to dance. Feel better? Are you coming? Our friends will be worried. Cairo... and then on to China? That's right. When did you make your decision? A few days ago. Is Professor Belloum so persuasive? You must have had doubts. I wouldn't wish such a dilemma on anyone. What is waiting for you in Beijing? A laboratory. A truly splendid one. There really was no choice. Knowing what I do, I must go or I could never live with myself. Can you understand that? Not really. I wish I could. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm very tired. Charles. I trust you. Right. - So what do you think? - I think you have very expensive whims. - One less crime on your conscience. - One more, one less... Well? - I've got nothing against Charles. - Thank you, Harris. - Just make sure he's convinced. - That's my problem. Charles! I know where you're going. Do you? To the Annonciade monastery. Don't try to deny it. Cecil followed you there before the reception. Dear old Cecil... You're going to tell Major Rome that Banck is defecting to China via Cairo. Let's drive. Harris has spent a fortune to see that Banck's defection goes smoothly. It's very important to him. How did you find out I work for Rome? I'm not sure you'll believe me. Oh? Go on. You're Rome's agent only because Harris wants you to be. Where are we? Exactly why does Harris want me to be Rome's agent? Harris knew Rome would never let Banck go to China. He would rather see him dead first. So he decided to choose the killer himself. It's easier to control him that way. Exactly. Killers can show up anytime, anywhere. But knowing that information ahead of time changes everything. Of course. So Harris chose me. We had to make Rome choose the man we wanted. We checked every officer who served under him. I think I may have found one. "Pierre Andrieu, currently employed as an Engineer at Pechiney." and makes 600k Francs a month. Rome would never choose him. Listen to this. "Lt Charles Beaulieu, first Parachute Regiment. "Algeria in 1958, decorated, bachelor, writer, and ex-journalist." That name sounds familiar. Didn't he just write a book? "...heavily in debt, goes out a lot." That's it? No it gets better. "Former shooting instructor." Almost too good to be true. What does he look like? Anything else? Gambler. Right after that, I was given the job of contacting you. So you picked me up on the road, came to the studio, walks in the park, Very neat. Anything more obvious would have made you suspect. I was under strict orders not to fake love or any other emotion for you. Yet somehow I had to get you to take me back to your place. Am I boring you? Don't judge me Charles. You don't know what I've been through. I want you to see the sort of life he makes me lead. I didn't like playing the game Charles. No need to apologize. I completely understand. But that second time at the hotel, you were perfect. An entirely different style. How did you tell Rome, I'd been offered a job by Sphax? Moranez did. Moranez? Didn't you know he worked for Rome? Obviously not. How would I? We found out Moranez was working for Rome. But rather than have Cecil eliminate him, Harris came up with something better. He turned him. Where have you been, bitch? I spent the afternoon with Charles Beaulieu, the writer. - Do you know him? - Vaguely. You're going to know him better. I've invited him over this evening. What did you just say? Now you listen to me, Harris. Either you stop interrogating me or I swear I'll file for divorce. I'll get started on that article - Particularly the start. - Yeah, yeah, the start. You were perfect, as usual. - Are you sure Beaulieu will come? - He'll come. He's about to file his report. Then get moving. - I want to use the phone. - A booth? Yes, please. A pack of Winstons. Then she said, "I spent the afternoon with Charles Beaulieu, the writer." - Beaulieu? - Yes. And he'll be at the party tomorrow. Harris looked furious. Listen Moranez, I want you to stick close. - Of course. - Do you think you know him? Seems everything was very well-planned. What about Harris's jealousy routine? If he didn't act jealous Rome would have suspected. - Then you're not his wife? - Of course not. I'm his agent. Just as you're Rome's. I can't think of anything that would surprise me now. I can. You're going to tell the Major that Banck is leaving for Cairo. Exactly. And Rome's going to order you to kill Banck. - I doubt that. - I think he will. - Only you won't kill him. - Huh? Harris will have you killed first. In Cairo, to be exact. This was the plan from the start. Is this confession also part of the plan? - No. - Then your game is over. Thanks to you, Harris's perfect plan is ruined. Why tell me all this? Guess. All of that is fine but what about tomorrow? - Do you have a plan? - Yes. And Harris agreed to it. Rome orders you to kill Banck. You accept. You leave with us tomorrow. But at Cairo, you stay on the plane. It goes to Karachi. That will be the last we see of Banck. Harris will give you $50,000. Wouldn't it be cheaper just to kill me? It would but he knows I don't want that now. And that could be dangerous for him. I'm a little cold. $50,000 25 million, to betray Rome. The money is to let Banck live. And after Cairo, on the flight to Karachi, you wouldn't be alone, Charles. I'd be there, if you want me. Harris promised me he wouldn't object. Rome would never ask me to do something like this. But that's exactly what he will do. Go to the monastery and see for yourself. What a bore that was. And to think what I gave up to come... Call me a taxi. Right away sir. Excuse me a moment. I don't know where he could have gone. You fool. It's not to hard to imagine. He expected me to act jealous but then I invited Charles. Now he's going to report to Rome. Take a cab and go to the monastery. If it's not too late already. Give me that. Take it. [praying in Latin.] Moranez is dead. - Who killed him? - Cecil. Banck is leaving in a few hours for Cairo. Come on. What time do they leave? The 12:00 clock flight. Harris wants me to go too. What's that? Moranez's belongings. You might've told me he worked for you. Security risk. You already had Moranez why did you need me? Important missions always use two agents. I took Cecil's wallet to delay identification. - You killed him? - It was necessary. Sit down. Are you sure Banck's going? Did he tell you himself? None other. You know I can't let him go. - That hurt? - What do you think? Charles, Banck is a traitor. So? It's not about the game, you want a firing squad. But that wasn't our agreement, and it's not part of the job. And I'm not amused. One person should be enough for this job. And besides, I know Cairo. If you go, you'll be killed. What if I told you I don't give a damn? It wouldn't surprise me. What bullshit. What a load of bullshit! Using beautiful women. You knew I would agree. You knew from the start. You choose Lieutenant Beaulieu for a reason. You knew you could control me. This is our agent in Egypt. He'll help get you out. Our North African branches have been alerted. It will all work out, Charles. Charles! My God, what happened? I'll tell you. Are you alright? You were right. He wants me to kill Banck. And I said yes. What are you really going to do? Did you tell him you were blown? No. What did you decide? I won't stop in Cairo. I'm going to Karachi with you. Frankfurt Airport They gone inside. Pan American flight 748 now boarding for Cairo from Gate A12. Cecil won't be coming. 20 minutes until takeoff. Don't turn around, Rome's here. Pan American flight 748 now boarding for Cairo from Gate A12. Did you know he was coming? Tickets please. He never said a word. Come on. It's time Henri, let's go. Stand back. Make way. This is an emergency! Charles. Your attention please. Some passengers may be asked to give statements regarding the incident in the terminal. Departure will therefore be delayed a few minutes. We thank you for your cooperation. Relax Harris, I won't shoot you. But Banck's coming back with me. Do you want to know why? Look at him. He's confused. The incident back there made him question things. Not his own political convictions, but the motivations of those around him. What do you think he sees when he looks around him? Comrades? Just merchants, traffickers, and murderers. What's gotten into you? I have the check in my bag. $50,000. Charles! To buy whom? Me. To let you live, Henri. So you were going to kill me too? I'll explain once we get off this plane. That's supposed to convince him? You miss the whole point. I think he wants to come with me. And nothing you or your Chinese friends do can stop him. You can't force scientists to work with threats. Charles... Coming Banck? Only a few minutes, he's exhausted. See Major? I brought you a visitor. - And Harris? - Finished. He left for Cairo. I'm taking Banck back to Paris. You won. You know, Banck, some mothers would rather see their own children dead than let someone else take them. I'm that way. You had a job to do. Rome. Why did you come to the airport? I knew Harris was going to kill you. I told him that you and Sandra were lovers. Then the supposedly jealous husband invited you to Cairo. Clear? As crystal. You found out. You knew they would try to kill you. Yes but it doesn't matter now. Be still. You knew they were on to you and you didn't say a thing. If I had, you would have taken my place. They would have killed you. Little jerk. And what if I hadn't intervened? I would have shot Banck before we landed in Cairo.
