"Lyin' Eyes" Lead Vocals: Vince Gill City girls just seem to find out early How to open doors with just a smile A rich old man, and she won't have to worry She'll dress up all in lace go in style Late at night a big old house gets lonely I guess every form of refuge has its price And it breaks her heart to think her love is only Given to a man with hands as cold as ice So she tells him she must go out for the evening To comfort an old friend who's feelin' down But he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin' She is headed for the cheatin' side of town You can't hide your lyin' eyes And your smile is a thin disguise I thought by now you'd realize There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes On the other side of town a boy is waiting With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal She drives on through the night, anticipating 'Cause he makes her feel the way she used to feel She rushes to his arms, they fall together She whispers, "That it's only for a while" She swears that soon she'll be comin' back forever She goes away and leaves him with a smile You can't hide your lyin' eyes And your smile is a thin disguise I thought by now you'd realize There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes She gets up and pours herself a strong one And stares out at the stars up in the sky Another night, it's gonna be a long one She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry She wonders how it ever got this crazy She thinks about a boy she knew in school Did she get tired or did she just get lazy? She's so far gone, she feels just like a fool My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things You set it up so well, so carefully Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things? You're still the same old girl you used to be You can't hide your lyin' eyes And your smile is a thin disguise I thought by now you'd realize There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes Honey, you can't hide your lyin' eyes "Love Will Keep Us Alive" Lead Vocals: Timothy B.
