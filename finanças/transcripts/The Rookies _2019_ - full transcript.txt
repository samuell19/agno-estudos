Yeah of course I was wrong, I know I was But does it matter now? Can it be changed? I regret it deeply... so I want to make it right to at least do something! To make it right? You were never thinking of that You're a very selfish person When you climbed buildings did you ever think of the people below you? Or about who would have to save you if you got stuck there? You ever think of them? Sure, you made it up to the top and you got a few likes But what's beyond all that? Yeah To you, it's nothing to everyone else, it's nothing To me though I can tell myself "no matter how high I can take the challenge!" I won't be scared, at least I'll try and you?! Zhao Feng Legless Phoenix... I know that you staged that whole contest on the lightning rod I know that you paid him to lose the competition Who will you find? Who do you think you are? Who am I? Who are we, huh? We're nothing, don't you see? Other than hiding behind a screen arguing with people I haven't really done anything! In my entire life! I don't want to keep being some loser I thought you could lead me to change Why don't you... - Have some way to... - Enough! I'm sorry I'll leave you alone now That's not the answer I want DM85 is, perfection... It turns the human body into a plant Isn't that amazing? So where should we start? That's exactly what I was thinking darling The United States has been the target of a terrorist attack Tens of thousands of New York City citizens are suspected to have breathed in a mysterious gas of unknown origin and vanished Up until now no organization has claimed responsibility What is this on my face? Accept your fate Hello? Miao Miao Can we meet up? Two bombs went off simultaneously letting off poisonous gas and tens of thousands of citizens have mysteriously disappeared The White House has announced in light of the incident to shut down the entire city of New York Shawnie All these years, I've bought your inventions back from online I hope it'll help you, guys There's not a lot that I can say out loud But with my legs gone I've nothing and now I'm not scared But I think I'm no use to you now So if you don't want me around, I'll understand Still I'll always encourage you and support you Everyone, go for it Oh, and Shawnie? Your assistants came too oh, and there's a friend who wants to explain the whole plan Give me that one... that one Back in high school, I did the Pole Vault Cool But one time, the pole I was using broke from then, on I was scared of heights and that's why I hate you 'Cause I can't remember how it feels to be at the top Does it feel nice? It feels... well, like you're not at the bottom I mean it is important to not be at the bottom, right? In high school, I would always think what college would be like But then I didn't ever get accepted When I started work, I wanted to see up top where the bosses worked But I got fired so... I've always had to look up from below It's only when I climb that I'm looked up to What'll the sun be like tomorrow? Together we'll go and come back This is youth! Cool! We locate Iron Fist's base and detonate this truck rigged with explosives inside it Finally a plan! I can tell you that kid is not yours just by looking at him... No, you can not! Shut up! If we were to go and tell those miserable beings that they only have a few more hours to live What do you think they would do? - Uh, er, I... don't know sir - Exactly, that's their answer too What was that!? What's going on!? Protect the boss!! That's the wrong guy! Get him out! Boss!! Pull! I'll be right there I'm the Chief! Do you understand me!? Let me go right now! Or you will all be dead! My men will come... Come on! Look! It's not high, let's jump You jump yourself! Third floor, clear! Shoot! They coming up? - Jump - No! Hold on, let me think - Now listen Feng, I'm telling you... - Come on, jump! There's got to be another way I know there is! You trust me? No! Look into my eyes trust me, it'll be over soon No!

The bomb's laid across 10 cities will be d... d... detonated within one hour! - No, no, please! - How do we stop it!? Iron Fist is using a satellite to remotely trigger the bomb No, no, please! - Slow doown! - I can't! Faster, faster! What are you honking at, doofus!? - There's a car chasing us, you're in danger! - Who do you think you are anyway!? - Quickly, quick! - You're a... a scumbag! - Huuh!? You... you... - Sit!

You're fooling yourself - Shut up - She's a monster 'cause of you - He's nothing but a terrorist, right? - And an idiot one at that, right? - Shut up! That's why her eye's open - So sad! - You're nothing but a foolish loser! Loser! - So dumb he fooled himself! - And you! You're nothing but a 'yes man' all your life! - And you talk about life - The chopper's ready I just changed my mind Two cities, that were not scheduled on the first wave - The fate of Budapest and Hong Kong... - Are you insane!? ...will now be changed by your hand Let go, Let go! Let go! Let go, let me go! Let go!
