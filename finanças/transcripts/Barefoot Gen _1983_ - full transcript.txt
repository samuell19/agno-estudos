Produced in Cooperation with MADHOUSE S TUDIOS Director MAMORU SHINZAKI Nobuo Oyama, going to the front lines now! Thank you for sending me off! Mr. Nobuo Oyama, banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Because I swore to win bravely and left my hometown... ...how can I die without doing great deeds? Every time I hear the marching trumpet... ...my mind recalls the waves of your flags. Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Don't you hate the military... Metal bowls and... ...metal chopsticks. I'm not Buddha. One meal a day is pathetic. I'm hungry. I'm dizzy. Me too. Here, here. This rice porridge is especially good today! Really? It's true! Look, the chopsticks stand up in today's porridge! Dad, I wanna eat rice porridge too! I wanna eat it! Bear with it. We used all our ration tickets and don't have any left. I wanna eat. I wanna eat. Wanna eat. Don't cut in line! What? I was keeping my spot! Shut up! Don't argue! What's that? You've done it now... Take this! All right! Fight, fight! How sad. Grownups fighting for a bowl of rice porridge. Yeah, it's just a bowl of rice porridge. Nakaoka Nakaoka I'm hungry! I'm home! Oops... I'm hungry! I'm home. What's there to eat? I have no choice... You're sneaky, Mom! You were hiding a potato. Looks good. Hey, Shinji! You're not going to share? Stay away! Wait, you! Hey! Wait, you! Wait, you! Hey! Wait, you dunce! Wait, you! You can't run. Well, I'm not letting go! Wait, you! You... Now I'm really mad. You're not getting by! Hey, wait, you stupid! Hey! Oops... Ow! Wait, you! You dummy! Come on, come on! Give it to me! Give it back! It's mine! Stop, you two! Give it back! Mom has to eat this potato. Why? Yeah, why? This potato is important for the baby in Mom's tummy. If you eat it, the baby will die. Is it okay if the baby dies? Eiko. I'm fine. Give it to Gen and Shinji. You might be fine, but the baby needs it. Eiko. Go ahead and eat. You two, be strong. Got it? You two, be strong. Got it? Got it. I want to let the children eat as much as they want. Even money can't buy food. What terrible times. Anyway, we just have to try our best. What's wrong? The baby's kicking in my belly. It tickles... I see. Have a healthy baby. Okay? This baby is healthy. It kicked again. Why're you laughing? The baby moving is funny. Yeah? How's it moving? Ouch! It moved! Oh, it's moving! At this rate, it's a boy. We won't know till it's born. Shinji, a boy's good. Yeah, you boss me around... ...so now I can do that. Mom, have a boy for sure. I'll make him my disciple. If you make him your disciple, Mom's going to have to worry... ...what you'll teach him. Right, we can't leave him to you! You're mean, Big Brother! I was kidding. You're a good brother, Shinji. After the baby's born, teach him many good things. I'm glad. I hope it comes soon. The air raid alert is issued! The air raid alert is issued! Gen, Shinji, get up quickly! The air raid alert is issued! The air raid alert is issued! Gen, Shinji, get to the shelter! I'm sleepy. Wake up! Wake up Shinji! Shinji! Shinji! All right, I'll wake him up! Shinji... Wow, rice, bread, and noodles! Lots and lots! Yeah? All right! It's empty... Big Brother, you ate it all by yourself? Dummy. Darn it, give me my share! Ow! Why you! You! Mine! Shut up! Shut up! Darn it! What are you doing? Um... What are we doing? Gen, hurry here! What'll you do if the bombs fall? What'll you do if the bombs fall? Ouch! Mom, don't worry. They're scouting planes. Don't be silly. Did you forget a girl in area four was shot by machine gun? Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Osaka, even Okinawa. Bombs are burning down and destroying things all over Japan. It's no time for nonsense. Even so, it's strange. All nearby cities were attacked... ...but why don't they attack the city of Hiroshima? The air raid alert is lifted! The air raid alert is lifted! The air raid alert is lifted! All right! The air raid alert is lifted! They were scouting planes. I lost out by waking up. I'm glad tonight was another... What's wrong, Mom? What's wrong? Just dizzy... Kimie! Kimie! Mom! Gen, go get the doctor! Eiko, the futon! Kimie! Kimie! Hang on! Hang on, Kimie! Big Brother, is Mom going to die? Is Mom going to die? Shut up! No way that's going to happen! Doctor, wake up! Mom's in trouble! My disciple is inside Mom's tummy! Hurry, hurry! Hey, if you rush this much, I'll get sick and die! That's fine! Yeah, Mom's more important! How is she? Overworked and malnourished. She'll recover with rest and nutritious food. But in times like these... ...there's not enough medicine, and one can't get nutritious food. Anyway, take care. This is bad. Our family's in big trouble. This is bad. I can't stand it. What's the matter, Eiko? The rice is almost gone. The money is gone too. I'll manage somehow. You don't need to do that. If we finish and deliver these to the dealer... ...we can get some money, right? You're not healthy. I'm fine. Eiko... Big Brother. Big Brother. What? Can we eat caterpillars? Let's see... Are they nutritious? I don't know. Shall we let Mom eat them? Dummy! Dummy! Ouch! What happened? Mr. Boku. Mr. Boku. It seemed noisy last night... Mom's sick because she's malnourished. You must be worried... It's good to drink carp's blood and eat its meat for energy... Carp? Carp? I didn't know carp was good for illnesses. I want to let Mom eat it. I want carp! I want some! Shinji! Shinji! Big Brother! Charge! Honorable death! Rock, scissors, paper! Thank you. Oops! Ouch! There. There are lots... There are. There are. People? None. None. All right. There. Here! B-Big Brother! It bit right away. They haven't eaten like us. Trouble! I'm being pulled! It's big... It's the master of the pond! Shinji, don't let go! Big Brother! Big Brother! Hold on tight! Why you! Why you! Shinji, look! Big Brother, you did it! There. It's the master of the pond, all right... Brats! You brat! I won't forgive you! Big Brother! M-Mister, hit me! Hit me! Hit me more! In exchange for hitting me all you want, give me this carp! That's right. Hit me with full force too! In exchange, give me the carp! Why do you want the carp so much? To let Mom drink the carp's fresh blood! That's right. We want to make her healthy. I don't want to let Mom die! Save Mom! Mister, please! Please! We beg you! No good? No good at all? You dummy, mister! When Mom dies, I'll tell her to haunt you as a ghost! When you want to be good to your parents, they're no longer alive. All right, take it. I'll give you the carp. Don't cry anymore. Really? If it's a lie, you'll drink 1,000 needles! Idiot, that's my line. We did it! This carp really was a gift? Yes. It really was. It's not a lie. Anyway, cook the carp quickly and let Mom eat it. Hurry, hurry. Eiko, cook this. Right! Big Brother... Will Mom get well? Well, I hope she gets well. Sorry for making you worry too. Dad will work hard too. Dad, when can we eat as much as we want? When the war's over, we'll manage somehow. Will the war end? Soon, I think. Japan lost this war. If Japan lost, why do we keep fighting? Our current leaders are wrong. And something's wrong with the army heads. Everyone calls you unpatriotic because you say things like that. That's right. I'm unpatriotic. Dad is proud of it. This war, in which people kill each other, can't be right. Being called unpatriotic is fine. Being called a coward is fine. Protecting people's lives and one's own life is true courage. Only fighting for that is true fighting. Gen, Shinji, don't be meek. Hold your heads high, all right? Dad. What? I love you, Dad. I love you too, Dad. Is that so. Is it all right that only I eat this fish? What are you saying? It's only natural since you're sick. I feel bad. Is it good? It's good. Shinji. What is it, Shinji? U-Um... Shinji, what did you say to Mom? I asked Mom to give me the leftover bones after eating the fish. You really said that? I did. Dummy! You dummy! You don't have to hit me! You don't have to hit me! Shinji, come quickly! Big Brother, you're a dummy. A dummy. Eiko. Eiko! Yes! Let everyone eat this. Please. Rice? It's not much... Mr. Boku... Thank you. Big Brother, carp works well. Yeah, Mom's gotten better. Excuse me. Mr. Nakaoka. I didn't think that man would come to the house. We're in trouble. They found out we went to steal the carp. Dad's scary when he's mad. Is that so... I'm sorry for their actions. I'll scold them well. No, please don't. I'd be troubled if you scolded those two. I like those two, Mr. Nakaoka. You have thoughtful, good sons. I envy you. Big Brother, what now? There's nothing we can do. Get ready to be hit. I'm scared. Gen. Gen. Shinji. Sit here. Come here. Gen. Shinji. Big Brother... The carp guy gave us kusamochi. It's good, Big Brother. My cheeks are about to drop. Yummy. Yummy. He was a good man. A good man. We need to give him an award. That day, at 2:45 AM... ...three B-29s took off from Tinian base in the Mariana Islands. Mom, I'll do the laundry. I don't want you to strain yourself. I'm fine. My muscles will get stiff if I rest too much. Dad, isn't this a good ship? Big Brother made it. It's good. When he gets back from school, we'll go to the river to sail the boat. Is that so. That must be fun. The enemy's come early today. The air raid alert is lifted! The air raid alert is lifted! The air raid alert is lifted! The air raid alert is lifted! Scouting planes again. Dad, the B's trail. You can see it well since it's clear. It'll be hot today. Sis, I'm going to school first. Big Brother, come home quickly. We'll sail the ship at the river. It's a promise! Dad, Sis, come look! What is it? What's wrong? The ants are coming inside the house. So many... What's going on? It's a B. It's a B-29. You're right. When did it come? How strange. The alert isn't sounding. What's going on? Ow... What happened? I don't remember anything... Why is this thing on me? Jeez... W-What happened? Hang on! S-She's dead... Someone! Someone, come... What happened? Ghosts... They're all ghosts! Fire! It's awful! My house is over there! Dad! Mom! Big Sis! Shinji! Hey, Dad! Mom! Big Sis! Shinji! Someone... Someone, please come! Mom's voice! Come quickly! Please save them! Mom, what's wrong? Gen, you're okay! Big Brother, it hurts! Shinji! Sis! Dad! I have to move this post quickly... That's right! Big Brother, let me out quick! Wait. I'll let you out now! Big Brother! Hurry, hurry! It's hot! It hurts! Big Brother, Mom, it's hot! It's no good. Damn it! Kimie, Gen, enough. Dear! Enough. Hurry and run! Dear! Eiko! Shinji! Enough. Run now or you'll be caught in the fire. No! I'll die here too! Fool, you need to raise Gen and the baby inside you. Run quickly! No! I don't want us to be apart! Gen, what are you doing? Hurry! What should I do? Take Mom and run! No! I don't want to either! Big Brother! Shinji! Eiko! Mom... I hate it... I hate this post! Gen. Protect Mom and the baby inside her... ...in my place. Please, Gen. No! Mom will die with you! It's hot! It's hot! It's hot! It's hot! It's hot! It's hot! Shinji! Eiko! Mom, it's hot! Mom, it's hot! Dear! Big Brother! Dear! Dad is burning... Eiko is burning... Shinji is... Burning... Burning... They're all burning... Mom. Mom. Mom, hang on! What are you doing? Run to safety quickly! Mr. Boku! Gen! Mrs. Nakaoka, get ahold of yourself! Gen, come quickly! Help! Water... Don't let go of the log! It hurts... Everyone, cheer up! Yoshida! Mutsukawa! Matsui! Kawada! This should be far enough. Gen, I have to go. Take care of your mother. Thanks, Mr. Boku. Mom, what's wrong? The baby is coming. The baby? Get a midwife and doctor... All right. And from somewhere... ...bring a washtub, bucket, futon, and some cloth. Just in case, scissors and thread. What for? To cut the umbilical cord. All right. Is there a midwife anywhere? Is there a doctor here? Is there a midwife? My mom is having a baby! Please, she needs help! No good. What should I do? What should I do? Mom, it's no good. I couldn't find a midwife or a doctor. What should I do? Gen, you'll have to deliver the baby. No way! I can't do it! You'll do it, all right? All right. Get water. Okay, water. When the baby's born, wash it well with the water. Mom, hang in there! It's coming... It's coming... Hold the baby's head gently. It has no wiener. It's a girl. She's wrinkly and looks like a monkey... Babies are all like that. You were too. I see. Then she's all right. She'll be pretty. Hey, I brought you into this world. Thank me. Listen to me or I won't be nice to you. Understood? Protect Mom and the baby. Have a boy! I'll make him my disciple! Dad! Big Sis! Shinji! The baby was born! Shinji, your disciple is a girl! Dad! Big Sis! Shinji! You can't see this baby, can you? Gen, give me the baby. All right, look very closely. Look close... ...at the reality of war that killed your dad, sister, and brother. All right... All right? It's rain! Oh no! Stop! Stop raining! There. What is this rain? It's really dark rain. No one at the time knew this black rain that fell in the northwest area... ...of Hiroshima would be the cause of so much human suffering... ...for decades to come. The atomic bomb's explosion... ...caused radioactive dust to fly up into the air, forming clouds... ...that rained radioactive rain onto the people and the land. The destruction from the 4,000 degree heat, the blast, and the fire. The pollution of the radioactive rain... ...was the second terror of the atomic bomb. Mom, it's noisy. I can't sleep. Water! Water! They want water. Poor people. Let's give them some. Hang in there... Hang in there. It's water. Now cheer up. H-Hey, what's wrong? Oh! She's dead! Here too! What's going on? They all die soon after drinking water. Mom, better not give them water. You're right... Mom, what are we going to do now? Let's see... All our relatives are in the city, and their houses must be burnt. We don't have a place to go. My head's mixed up, and I don't know what to do. There, there. What's wrong? There's no milk. If you can't make milk, the baby will die! Come to think of it, we've had nothing but water for three days. We need to look for food. Oh, there, there... There, there. Mom, wait here. What's the matter? I'll go look for food. Gen. I won't let them die! I'll never let Mom and the baby die! Wait for me. Wait for me! But where should I go? Hey, where'd you get the rice balls? An army truck is driving around delivering them. R-Really? Where? I don't know. Look for it yourself. We found them at Dobashi. Dobashi, huh... An army truck! Hey, give me some rice balls too! A mountain of bodies... Hurry and clear away! Quickly, before the dead bodies rot! We'll never be able to finish disposing of them. It stinks! There are so many dead bodies... A fire brigade hat. Horrible. Horrible... The humans are like pebbles on the street. It's like a dream that each of those dead bodies used to cry and laugh. It's hell... I didn't know you can get maggots in burn scars. When they wiggle, it hurts and itches. I can't stand it. Wish I could eat them. Idiot, don't talk about food. Somebody, please... Can somebody give her some milk? She's going to die! Please! Excuse me... He doesn't know she's dead... Somebody, please give her milk. Please... Please... Shut up! It's better if the baby dies quickly! Die! Die! Die! What are you saying? I'll kill her. Give her to me! What are you doing? Stop! Stop! Take it. Take it. Eat till I have no more milk left. Missus... I'm sorry for saying such violent things... I was jealous of the healthy baby. My baby is like that. My milk is useless to my baby now. I want her to have as much as I can. Missus. Aren't you lucky? I'm so lucky... Everything's gone. Everything's disappeared. I'm cold... I'm cold... Mr. Soldier, are you crazy? It's so hot. I'm cold! Did I catch a cold in the rain? Mr. Soldier, you pooped. Idiot, how could I... B-Bloody stool! W-When did I... Mr. Soldier, you have bald spots. Idiot, I'm not bald... What's going on? What's wrong? Mr. Soldier, hang on! What should I do? What should I do? What should I do? Oh no... ...I need to do something! I'm... ...hungry. All right, it's done. Here... I did it! I'm smart! Mr. Soldier, hang in there. Where's the first aid station? Where's the first aid station? Nurse, hurry... Treat only those who can survive. Right! We don't have any medicine left! Take a look at this soldier! He's dying! Here comes another one. Let's see. Did he have diarrhea, cough up blood, or feel cold? He did. Please treat him quickly. There's no need. He's dead. It's pika. This must be pika. It's pika. It's due to pika. Not only did one atomic bomb kill over 200,000 people in an instant... ...it became an invisible monster called residual radioactivity... ...and crept into the bodies of the rescue workers... ...and of those entering the area, worried about family. It destroyed their cells... ...gave acute leukemia and cancer, and killed them. It's pika. This must be due to pika. Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! What's this? It's rice! It turned into charcoal... I see. This is the market warehouse. What a waste. I can't eat it now that it's turned into charcoal! I thought so! The center wasn't burnt! I did it! I did it! I did it! I did it! I did it! We have rice and pickles. Mom, we're all right now. Don't worry. Gen, thank you for finding this. You gathered a lot too. Oh, she's sleeping well. We need to give her a name. You're right. Can you think of a good name? There are so many fires. They're burning the deceased. Lots and lots died... I know. It's unbearable. It's unbearable. Mom. What? I hope she makes lots and lots of friends. Oh, how's Tomoko? ("Tomoko" = Child with friends) Tomoko? ("Tomoko" = Child with friends) ("Tomoko" = Child with friends) That's a good name. ("Tomoko" = Child with friends) Tomoko it is. ("Tomoko" = Child with friends) All right, you're Tomoko starting today! Gen, what happened? You have a big bald spot... I'm not bald. Oh no! W-When did it happen? He's dead. It's due to pika. Due to the atomic bomb! Gen. No! I don't wanna die! What's wrong? I'm scared! I don't wanna die! What are you saying? You won't die. You're fine. Meanwhile, America... ...declared an atomic bomb caused Hiroshima's destruction. They warned of a second atomic bomb drop if the war continued. They demanded Japan's unconditional surrender. But the Japanese war leaders turned a deaf ear. They did not make Hiroshima's devastation public at all. August 9th They did not make Hiroshima's devastation public at all. August 9th Atomic Bomb in Nagasaki Too I thought deeply of the world's situation and Japan's current one. I've decided to settle this situation through extraordinary means. Therefore, I give this notice to the loyal and good people of Japan. I ordered the government to accept the Potsdam Declaration... ...of the US, UK, China and Soviet Union. But I would like you to endure intolerable things... ...put up with unbearable things... ...and make peace come true for the future. I will protect Japan's imperial system... ...trust the sincerity of the loyal and good people of Japan, and... Gen. What, Mom? Dad, Eiko, and Shinji are really dead, aren't they. That's right. They're dead. Mister, why're you crying? There was an announcement from the emperor earlier. Japan lost the war. The war's over with an unconditional surrender. What do you mean the war's over now? Mom. Cheer up. I'll do my best for dad too. All right, I'll build a house here. August 15, 1945 Japan Lost the War Tomoko, don't cry. There, there. Mom doesn't have any milk. I want her to have real milk, not just thin rice porridge. The rice you found will be gone soon. Let's eat. Give me Tomoko. I can't find a place to work... We're really in trouble... We're in trouble. I need to do something. Who's there? You! Wait! No. You! Ow! If I wasn't hungry, I wouldn't have lost! Well said. Show your face. Mom, look at his face! Here, look at this face! Let go. Shinji. Shut up! I'm not Shinji! You're not Shinji? No. There's no way Shinji could be alive. I'm Ryuta Kondo! I haven't eaten for four days. The rice porridge smelled too good, and I... Where's your family? Everyone died in pika. You look just like my dead little brother. I'm Ryuta! This is mine. Eat it. Is it all right? Really? Don't rush. Take your time and eat. You'll take it if I don't. You'll take it if I don't. I won't take it away. Really? Don't worry. Where do you live? The burnt ruins around here. You can have mine too. Sit and eat. R-Really? You look exactly like Shinji. It's true. I've heard everyone has five people who look like them in the world. But I'm really surprised. Can I have that? That's empty. I can't think of him as a stranger. Mom. Hey, what do you think? We're having a difficult time just with the two of us... But if I can think Shinji is alive... That's right! I haven't eaten such good food in a long time! If you... ...want to stay here, you can stay. Ryuta, stay. Live with us. Stay. Stay. Ma'am... I can't give anything in return, so let me massage your shoulders. I used to massage my dad, and I'm good. Thank you. But children don't need to worry about things like that. We're family. This... This is the first time someone's ever been so kind to me! Don't cry so loud or Tomoko will wake up. See? I knew it. You can cry as much as you want. Oh, there, there. Look at her bad rash! That's right. She's malnourished. She needs better food soon. All right, I have a good idea! Please give us work! We'll do any work! Please give us a job. We'll do any work! Please give us a job. We will! Please give us a job. We'll do anything! Please give us a job. We will! There's no one with work. There isn't, Big Brother. What's that? I said Big Brother. Say it again. Big Brother. Big Brother. Again. Big Brother. You're happy when I call you that? Makes me happy. I'll say it more. Big Brother. Big Brother. Do you want a big brother? I'll give you a good price! Dummy. Will you really do any job? Mister, you'll give us a job? If you complete the job well, I'll give you ten yen a day. Ten yen! We will! We'll do it! Then follow me. What a great house... He's very rich! Come in. Dad brought someone again. They'll run right away. This is your workplace. It stinks! Yeesh, what is this room? It's full of poop! It's full of maggots. I can't stand it! Seiji, I brought these boys to take care of you. Tell them to do anything. Brother... All right, take care of him. Wait... We need to talk... Brother! As expected. They'll run soon. How could they let it get this bad? What should we do, Big Brother? Ten yen. Tomoko needs milk. That's right. That's right. Hey, vultures! Us? Looks like. Quickly, pick the maggots and clean the room. Right! Right! Maggots are white and dirty. Clean up, clean up, it's fun. They're not running. Are they crazy? Haruko! Akiko! What if you get the pika disease? Get away from here now! Dear, can we move Seiji to a hospital? Every hospital is full of people with pikadon. With your money and power... Don't have such ill will for Seiji... He's my only brother. But you're unwilling to go near him too. He smells and looks like a ghost. And he raises his voice like a beast. The neighbors are calling this house a haunted house. I hope Seiji dies soon. Idiot! Ow, what are you doing? Do it carefully, idiot. Don't kick me! The bandage is stuck to the pus! Shut up, vulture! Don't you know how to be gentle, vulture? Y-You! Big Brother, shall we beat him up? Ten yen. Bring me the book on the desk, vulture. I'm Gen Nakaoka, not a vulture! Yeah! I'm Ryuta Kondo! Those who make a living off my rotting body are vultures. Got that, vultures? It's ten yen a day. Right, ten yen. Here's the book. Pick it up, vulture. Ten yen. Ten yen. I want water, vulture. The book. Pick it up, vulture. Ryuta! What, Big Brother? No more ten yen! You should act your age, not like a spoiled brat! I can't take care of you! Yeah, we can't deal with a fool like him! I'm going home! Yeah, he makes me sick! W-Wait, Gen Nakaoka, Ryuta Kondo. You called our names for the first time. Did I hurt you? No, I'm happy. You're happy you were hit? He's funny. Shall I hit him more? Hit him. All right, hit me more. Why do you want to be hit? People's hearts turn ugly just because of some missing skin. My brother, his wife... Haruko and Akiko, who used to be close to me... They all drifted away. Many people came to care for me. But each of them snuck out right away. You're the only ones who took me seriously. I was happy. Ryuta. Ryuta. What, Big Brother? Tell Mom. What? What? That I can't go home for a while. Got it, Big Brother. I'm going. Gen... Gen... Seiji, cheer up. Don't cry. Laugh and cheer up! Laugh and blow the pain away. Here! S-Stop! Laugh! Laugh! Laugh! Laugh! S-Stop! Take this! Take this! Stop! Gen is right. I need to cheer up. I thought I'd never be able to paint again. But I don't need to use my hands to paint. No good... You can do it, Seiji. Yeah, don't give up! Damn it... Hang in there! Don't give up! Yeah, yeah! There's one hundred yen inside. One... One... One hundred yen? I'm sure my brother is happy that you cared for him. I'm grateful from the bottom of my heart. Really? He said that? Now I can buy milk for Tomoko. I'm glad. Come again. You hang in there. Hang in there! I'm fine! I'll do it! You hang in there too! Po-po-potatoes, sweet potatoes. Broil them, simmer them, eat them. The stomach gets full and fart, fart, fart. Stinky wind comes out. Fart, fart, fart. Do you need milk? Milk? This milk is full of nutrition! Powder milk from America. These are all we have. You can't get it anywhere else! Mister, give me all the milk. You have the money? Here. You see? W-What? Mom! Tomoko! Ma'am! It's milk! It's milk. Abundant milk! Tomoko's milk! Tomoko's milk! Tomoko's milk! Tomoko's milk! Tomoko's milk! Mom! Ma'am! Mom, I'm home! Look! It's real milk. We bought all the milk on the black market. Don't worry anymore. Yeah, now Tomoko will be healthy. Attention! Attention! Attention! Chief, it's a success! Good work! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Attention! Left face! Look, Mom. Gen... Too late. It was too late. Tomoko... Tomoko! Tomoko! Open your eyes! I brought your milk. Tomoko! What's wrong? Open your eyes now. She won't open her eyes... She won't cry! Cry! Cry! Open your eyes! No! No! You can't die! Why? Why'd you die without telling me? Tomoko! Dad! Big Sis! Shinji! I couldn't protect Tomoko! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Big Brother, no grass or trees will grow in Hiroshima for 70 years? Is it true? What is going to happen to us? Big Brother, you're depressed. It's no fun. Wait! Wait! Wait! Big Brother, come here! Hurry, hurry! What? Look at this! A-A bud! A bud is sprouting! Wheat sprouts up in cold, harsh winters... ...is stepped on often, and is rooted deep in the earth. It resists frost, wind, and snow, grows straight... ...and makes splendid ears. Become strong like wheat, boys. The wheat is alive. Alive. It's alive. It won't lose to pika. Who said grass or trees won't grow for 70 years? Right, Big Brother? Oh, your head! Hair! Hair is growing on my head! Big Brother, the hair may be in exchange for Tomoko's life. Tomoko? Tomoko? Yeah, it must be! You say good things. I may have received Tomoko's life. That's right! The wheat grew. The hair grew. The hair down there hasn't grown yet. Dummy! I'll tell ma'am! Dad, I won't be beaten. I'll live, live, and live to the end! Watch me! Big Brother, come home quickly. We'll sail the ship at the river. It's a promise! Big Brother, what are you starting? Shinji, this is your battleship. As promised, we'll sail it. Ready, Ryuta? Ready. Mom, ready? Ready. The shimmer of summer's hot air wavers... ...and floats on a stream. A faraway feeling now... ...doesn't come back anymore. Everyone lives while making mistakes. Happiness and sorrow come and go. Let's leave this risk. It disappears in a stream. Clear your thoughts, and a deep feeling... ...which floats on the flow of time still remains. Everyone lives while dreaming and praying. Happiness and sorrow come and go. This vanity will be carried. It is a remnant flower of the flow of the times. Everyone lives while repeating to solve riddles. Yet people don't know where they are going. Let's entrust this sadness. It blends with the flow of love. The End
