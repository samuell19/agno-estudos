Pounds at 25 cents I don't know what will become of this city. What we could do. We were not affected by the hurricane... Irene, but the following week, we had tropical storm Lee. We had more than a meter of water in the restaurant. I knew we would be inundated. We all had a hard time getting over it. We were underwater for three days. It was heartbreaking for many people. They lost everything. Their photo albums... The city has been emptied of its inhabitants. People had no choice. It happened so quickly. We lost half the city overnight. Our restaurant was originally open seven days a week. We set up the establishment on our own. We were pretty proud. The restaurant is more beautiful than ever. We redone the interior, we have brand new equipment. It's the bright side, but... we can't say it worked very well for us. We had lost too many inhabitants. There was not much to do. We manage as best we can, with the flea market. There is no more work here. That is the problem. We could revive the banks and the industry. I would only have needed $ 40,000.

Maybe next week. It might cool off a bit, I don't know. We are approaching 40 ° C. As promised, we will talk about it in the weather forecast, just now, at 7:35 a.m. And even the minimum...

She had magnificent hair. She led a happy life. The little birds were singing. A beautiful day, the girl went for a walk by the sea, and saw a huge whale in the water. And suddenly, the whale... turned into a man. She couldn't take her eyes off him. They made love passionately. And the following summer, the young woman gave birth to a baby whale. Subsequently, she gave birth to human children, boys and girls. Then the young woman became a very old woman. And his grandchildren, grown up, had stopped listening to his stories. One day, the grandchildren launched: "Let's go kill a whale! "What are you going to do to prevent us, the ancestor?" She replied: "I beg you, don't do that! "Let me warn you: "we are all descendants of a whale." The next morning, they came back to see the whale washed up on the beach, but she had changed into a man, she even had hair.
