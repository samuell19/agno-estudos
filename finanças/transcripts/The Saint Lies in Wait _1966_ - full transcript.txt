It's for tonight. In a few minutes, these five men will make a surprise attack... ...the most powerful of their competitors... ...the almost fabulous character... ...whose reputation extends beyond Britain. He is Simon Templar known as "The Saint"... ...because as an outlaw, he played fairest. The Saint with 1001 exploits. The Saint, who fought crime with virtue. The Saint. The Saint Lies in Wait There, behind that window... ...unaware of the danger that threatens him... ...and doubtless working on a new attack plan... ...The Saint is on the job. He's watching. Here he is! Here he is... with a halo of prestige! As depicted by an inspired artist... ...and as he will remain in human memory. There you go! You didn't make much progress, my dear friend. I think I'm getting too old for checkers. Don't underestimate yourself. A scotch? Gladly. Chartier, known as "Oscar the Tortuous"... Mind... complicated. The sort who knows the best time to rob a jewellery store. Particular sign: likes girls, and loves other people's. That's gold, I'd say. Of course! 8.5 kilos... The football World Cup! An opportunity I grabbed ...while passing by Central Hall... ...where she was foolishly displayed. A hideous object... just good for melting down! That stuff must be expensive, right? -50 francs. No way to pay it I have no time to waste. And you operated alone, without backup? I've always preferred to work alone. I loathe gangs! They feel the same about you. Remember in Los Angeles, it was a bit touch and go, eh? If I'd not been there... I know dear friend, that I owe you my life... Yes... and I always pay my debts. Unfortunately, life is priceless... ...and the more its at risk, the more its value increases. But is it true what they say... no more hold-ups? For me yes... finished. What a pity! They'd given you a lot of satisfaction. Now that the kid has grown up, I can't afford to take risks anymore. She thinks I'm a great businessman... ...riding in Rolls Royces and hooked up to Wall Street. I can't shatter her illusions. - She must be a pretty girl now. - Gorgeous. I'll show you a photo of my little Sophie. Here she is when she came into the world. Newborn... already sexy! And two months ago, at Piccadilly Circus. I boarded her in London, at private schools... ...to improve her English and her education. Excellent program... but what about you? Precisely. It's to tell you my plans that I came here, deep in Scotland. I need your advice. Yes, advice and a small favor at the same time. In memory of Los Angeles, I'm listening, my dear Oscar. Well I've decided to ensure my future and that of my daughter... ...retiring from the circuit after making a fortune. You know what I mean. A once-in-a-lifetime operation! Just give me the facts my friend, before you start dreaming! I am currently in a relationship with a top-class big wheel. Powerful, lot of influence in diplomatic circles. - What's his name? - Stableman. - Sleeman... - You know him? No. Sleeman is in possession of top-secret documents. Something to blow up the planet! - How much is he asking? - 100 million old francs. 200,000 dollars. To blow up the planet, it's cheap. The operation is simple addition and subtraction. - And arrest! - No, on that side, nothing to fear... I'll have the documents photocopied. I'll sell for $500,000 to the Germans without the Americans knowing. and $500,000... - ...to the Americans without the Germans knowing. Yeah. Net profit... One million dollars. Less the 200,000 that you owe to Sleeman. I've no intention of giving him anything. Because you think your Sleeman is pretty stupid... ...to deliver the documents to you free of charge. - I know he respects me. - For your good looks! He's a physiognomist. We've worked together before. - He's an honest man. - He's a scoundrel! A trafficker in women, narcotics, and an assassin, I have proof! He'll screw you. My dear Chartier, beware. Yes, well he'll have to get up early! He won't go to bed before having you murdered! As for secret agents, it's no secret they've no secrets between each other. When the Germans and the Americans learn you sold them the same thing... ..they'll hunt you down. Sleeman, the Germans and the Americans will chase the same hare... And you'll end up in the stew my dear Chartier! By that time I'll be far away and my dollars well hidden. I planned everything, all timed! I go by the clock. And what time is your funeral? Oh, death... We all die eventually. For me, Sophia is all that matters. And that she lives like a little queen. Those are feelings that do you proud, Daddy... ...but that doesn't tell me what I should do. If there's danger, you'll receive this distress message. I'll die peacefully, if you promise me... ...to protect Sophia in the event of an alarm. I promise. And to collect the dollars where they'll be waiting for you. It's a promise, word of The Saint, but where will they be waiting for me? Ah, my friend Tonio, master oil-maker in Sicily, will tell you. I'll have to go to Sicily, but wouldn't it be easier... ...to tell me right away where the dollars will be? That would be too simple... one can never be too careful. Your friend Tonio... how will he recognise me? Oh, I was going to tell you... Very important... Just a moment... Hello? Hello, Uniatz? We have visitors. Take care of it. There are four of them. Visitors at this hour? Yes, why not. Whisky? Yes, gladly. Matt...! Two whiskies. You look worried. What's wrong? It's odd. What? A weird feeling all of a sudden. I don't know why. Really? What sort of feeling? An odd feeling. Your imagination. Anyway... When you arrive in Rusticana, Sicily... ...you'll see my friend Tonio and you'll tell him... "the elephant is in the boiled egg" That means nothing. Obviously, it's a password! And here's the sign of recognition. Oh that!? As the Duke of Bedford would say, you're a little trigger-happy. Matt! Two more whiskies! I apologize for the glassware, I fired too fast and to the side too! Sleeman shoots better. You'll see. Boss! Here are two of them. The other two aren't presentable. Just good for scrap! -Perfect, Uniatz, perfect! Neat work as usual! Those two, if I understand correctly, are the remainder. Yes sir. What do I do with them? Freshen them up. Thanks again! There's a matter finally settled! I fear yours doesn't end so well... Sure of himself and ignoring The Saint's warning... ...Chartier, without further delay, went to London... ...at the port, where he met, on his yacht, the unsettling Sleeman. Sleeman, with a perfidious smile, with sweaty palms. And just as Chartier had planned it... ...Sleeman, who did not imagine anyone dared break their word to him... ...gave him the documents under promise of prompt payment. Chartier immediately flew to Berlin... ...where he sold them for $500,000... ...to one of the top officials of the German secret service... ...the dubious Herr Mueller-Strasse... ...a singular character worthy of "Serie Rose"... ...and another nice sample of humanity. Without wasting time, Chartier then raced to Paris... ...where he resold the photocopy of the documents for the same amount... ...to Colonel Wade of the US Secret Service. After which... ...he vanished. Careful not to pay Sleeman... ...he had hidden his dollars... ...and headed for the border. - Mr Chartier, no doubt? - Yes, maybe, why? Mr Schmultz, associate of Mr Mueller-Strasse. Oh yes, really...? That's funny. - How is he? - Very bad! Very very bad! The documents that you sold to him are fake! Yes Mr Chartier, fake! - It's a joke, right? - Do I look like I'm joking? It's not possible! Look at me Mr Schmoul. - Schmutz! - Yes yes Mr Schmutz. Thanks. I'm an honest man... and if you knew my seller... He's impeccable! We don't want to know him. You will settle with him... ...as we will settle with you. Do you think I'm not unsettled enough as it is? No, but listen... Tell Mr Mueller-Strasse I sincerely regret all of this. Tell him I'll carry out my own investigation... ...and that I'll tell him the result as soon as I have it. No need to waste your time... Mueller-Strasse is next door. He'll give you all the details. Would you come with me. Well in that case, congratulations Mr Schmoul! Schmutz please! That changes everything! I've dollars here in my suitcase. I hate complications so... ...I'll give him back his dollars... ...he respects me... ...and I win again! Isn't that true Mr. Schmoul? Not Schmoul, Schmutz! And now you're nobody! And my dollars are well hidden, you fool! That bastard Sleeman! Now I'm in conflict with Germany... 55 million people! Get up...! He jumped over there! Come on... He can't get away! There he is! Go on! Quickly! Hurry up! Stop! Stop! Surrender! Hands up! Chartier surrendered obediently. The distress message was sent. And as if he'd arrived safely... ...The Saint, always true to friendship, set out to keep his promise. Ah, Uniatz, you're going too far... we're at 11, we're going to 7. So what? 7 comes before 11. Gosh! You know me and mathematics... It's not within everyone's reach. Life's so complicated! Wait for me here and don't do anything stupid. - Be a good boy. - Yes Boss. Hello Sleeman? Hello Sleeman? What's new? What's happened? The girl's gone? The Saint! You've seen the Saint?! The devil has sent him to us! How could he have known, up there, in Scotland! Ah... But maybe he has radar in his skull! But what's he after? The girl? The dollars? Maybe both... I’ll make him swallow his halo... I'm on my way! Give me my gun... you never know! I don't trust him with that umbrella of his. And your daddy begged me to board you until further notice. So I chose the institution of Mrs MacMish. I inquired: food both nourishing and delicious... Supervision strict. A very quiet place, a true paradise! But she's going to be bored to death, poor girl! Madam, heaven is not the place where we have fun, is it baby? I hope we get her back to you very soon... She will only appreciate the charm of your hospitality all the more. You hear what Mr Templar's saying? - Yes Ma'am. - You have to obey your dad! - So pack your bags immediately! - Yes Ma'am. I'm very sorry to leave you. You have always been so kind to me. But since my dad demands it... There, we are very reasonable, very reasonable! We're a well-behaved big girl. So... hurry up! - I have a plane to catch. - Give me 5 minutes. What a love! She was beginning to speak English fluently. Yes I thought I understood that she knew half of it. And on our side, thanks to her, my daughter and I learned French. That child is so endearing! A real model little girl! Me! My thighs yes! Does your father give orders? Yes, but I won't let myself be remote-controlled! First, tonight I've a date with Richard for the mouth-to-mouth operation! Until he sees me again, he has time to try harder. You can't just leave like that! You give me time to slip away, or I'll flatten you! So, goodbye Mary! Sophie don't do that! You'll fall! If I fall, I'll go down laughing! Hello Sleeman, Bodanizan... The girl's getting out through a window. Don't let her escape, I'm on my way! -OK. Goodbye, Mary! - Have you seen a young girl? - Young girl? Yes I saw a young girl. - Where did she go? - Through the window, a little monkey! - Where did she go then? - That way! Some guy pushed her into a car which happened to come by! They kidnapped her! Hey, that's right... they kidnapped her! The guy who pushed her... what did he look like? Like an Englishman? A German? Oh, more of a darkie... They went that way. Get moving! Go straight ahead! - Where are we going, Boss? - Just drive fast. You've nothing to fear. There's no more honest man than Dad! Dad has such rigid principles! To be so honest, I find it demoralising! You'll be paid, won't you? Are you kidding me or what!? Your father, an honest man?! A crook, yes! A mobster, a bandit! "Oscar the Tortuous"! You're not saying that, just to make me happy? "Oscar the Tortuous"! Like the guy on a spree in "The Saint and the Phantom"? Oh... gosh! Here's me, thinking he's just a filthy capitalist! But he'll make mincemeat of you, you silly man! You're fat but carry no weight! How much weight did that carry? Does this make the weight? Stop you're hurting me! It's not possible! What's not possible? The Saint? The Saint! Arriving from the heavens to serve you! Help! Help! He threw acid in my face! Help! Done! Boss...! Everything's ready! We can leave! Thank you Uniatz. Oh, you slob... that's enough! Help! And now, you will do what you're told! -The Saint! Daughter of Oscar the Tortuous and saved by The Saint! Oh... It's wonderful! You know, if I had known that... Uniatz! Take the young lady to the MacMish Institute. What! We can't part like this! And join me at the airfield. We fly to Palermo at 8.36 p.m. Taxi! - You won't give me an autograph? - No, but a spanking, very willingly. - So get started! - Mrs MacMish will take care of it. - Hurry up! See you soon! - Yes Boss! A newspaper sir? Guess who it is! Come on, guess! The good little girl? It can't be true! It's not true! Hello, Sir. Don't stand there. Come and sit next to me! What is wrong? You're not going to tell me you're not happy to see me? And Uniatz? - What've you done with Uniatz? - Uniatz? I believe he had trouble with his car. Where did you get the money to buy your ticket? My ticket? It's Uniatz's ticket. You stole his ticket? There was no use asking him to give it to me. I was in a hurry. And as he's a bit slow on the uptake, he would've delayed me. I'd like to be rude for 30 seconds to say that you are, Miss Sophie... ...the damnedest little monster that I ever met... ...in all of my godamned, disgustingly shitty existence! You... You! So you are The Saint! This is fantastic! Being with you like this, 5000 metres up! And it's not over! Would you like to follow me to the end of the Earth? Seriously? I'd even go further! Now I know I'm the daughter of Oscar the Tortuous, I want to honour my dad! If I only knew where he is. Where was Chartier? In Berlin! At the mercy of the relentless Mueller-Strasse... ...who has only one objective... ...to recover those dollars, as demanded by his government. Where had Chartier hidden his loot? Where? Where? Where?! But Chartier was hard... ...hard of hearing. An artist in all approaches... Strasse used all possible means:... Anger... indignation... In vain. He became persuasive... pitiful... His honour, his reputation, his wife, his children... (In fact, he was single) In vain. He finally tried cheerful... tender... cuddly... ...endearing. In vain. He produced crocodile tears. Ah... Chartier, why must you be so incorrigible and incomprehensible.? Well, We would see what we would see! And to convince this bestial obstinacy Mueller Strasse resorted to the latest advances in science and technology. So Chartier was delivered... ...to good care of the illustrious Professor Teppurst... ...grand inquisitor in psychology and Nobel Prize in Science Fiction! Mueller Strasse asked him to extract from Chartier's brain... ...the location of the hidden dollars! So? Herr Professor? - Total success! - Wonderful, Herr Professor! So Chartier... ...those dollars... Where are they? Dollars Dollars No! Cut the comedy! I begin to have enough! Where are the dollars?! Comedy... dollars... Professor! What does that mean "brouh brouh"? No need to question him. He won't answer you! What do you mean? No, since it was a complete success! Science has just taken a big step! I've reduced the subject to his simplest form! Intellectually, he is nobody! How is he nobody?! But his memory!? Memory!!! No more memory! His brain's been washed clean. I never asked you to brainwash him! Now you've wrecked everything! Do you imagine that I'll getting scammed out of 500,000 dollars every morning?! And here's the result of your experiments... "brouh brouh yum yum"! Experiments! brouh brouh! yum yum! brouh brouh! yum yum! No one in the world knew where the dollars were. Chartier himself had forgotten! All Mueller-Strasse had was one hope... Chartier's daughter, Sophia! Sophie, who had been closely watched by agents, for some time. In the US Secret Service things weren't much better. Colonel Wade, who soon realised that the documents were false... ...decided to recover the dollars from the CIA... ...defrauded by Chartier. Send for Mutt, will you. He sent Mutt, a loyal secret agent, on the trail of Sophie. You're going to Sicily. As for the oily Sleeman, determined to kidnap Sophie... ...he was getting ready to leave for Sicily too. He hadn't got a dollar out of Chartier... ...and was preparing to take holy bloody revenge. So it's in Sicily that all these nice people will find themselves... ...for a meeting that hadn’t been arranged. Very elegant in their beautiful secret agent suits... ...Mueller Strasse and his personal guard. Which translates as... "The Saint and the girl left for Rusticana." Worrying news. Johnny K.Wu. Mutt... ...the not-so-secret agent of Colonel Wade. Which translates as "The Saint and the girl left for Rusticana." Worrying news. Sleeman also learns the same news. The Saint and the girl left for Rusticana. Regular incident in the land of the Mafia... Remembering that he was completely devoid of courage... Sleeman decided to call in the specialists. But hit-men were in high demand that year... Only Joe Colossi was available, with his trusty lieutenant Gringo. You don't miss Chicago? We always miss the lost paradise of our youth. But youth is fickle. Good. Getting back to your request... Do you really want this guy and this girl out of your hair...? And that we bring them back to you tied up? What do you think, Gringo? Tied up, and alive? Yes, alive! And I'll decide later. If it was only to spray them with the antisubmarine, we'd agree. We'll take them for a little walk, as we used to do. Remember, Gringo? Yes I remember, three would leave and only two return. That would be nice! But fussing with a little kidnapping, now that we're out of the business... No! Yes, but if they're not alone, you'd be able to kill the others. And it's been so long since we used the tommy-gun. And to get back to work at our age! Maybe it will rejuvenate us! You think? - Yes. We don't need the money. We do work for charity... or maybe my brother the priest. He's been asking us to rid him of a tramp, for ages. - Do you want me to pay you right away? - Oh no... We know you'll pay. We trust ourselves. - Rheumatism? - No, it's a memory of Sadi the Goat. A misplaced bullet. He was always shooting wide instead of aiming there... ...between the eyes. Kiss me my brother, for this fountain of youth! Like always, before the hit. While Sleeman was hiring labour... Chartier, emptied of himself... ...brainless, more unconscious and more depersonalised than ever... ...was miraculously managing to escape... ...through primitive instinct for animal freedom. Still in the same state of deficiency... ...he went to Paris. He'd become a person, but exactly nobody. He'd even lost the memory of Sophie... ...and his old friend The Saint. Is this Sicily? Nothing's happening on your island! Here, James Bond would register as unemployed. Don't speak so lightly of a country where Carthaginians and Greeks... Hey! Do you think you're National Geographic? Anyway, where are we going exactly? That's a question that a true adventurer never asks! We're going to see Tonio. And he lives so far away, this Tonio? - Do you see that village over there? - Yes. Well it's Tonio's. Rusticana. Sweet Rusticana. We put it to the vote for Tonio Cotoni: life or death? Death! - Death! - Death! Execution? Now! -All right. Wait, I said he sold us out! Meet in front of Tonio's in ten minutes. Are you Mr Tonio Cotoni? Yes why? Oh, you come from Chartier! He must have given you a certain thing for me. One moment. I close the door and we go upstairs to my place. More secure. - Your daughter is so pretty! - She's my sister! Fake brother! But what's this thing that we have to give you from dad? Hush! There are spies on every step! But she looks more like you! Who is? Your sister whom I had taken for your daughter. She's not very pretty, but she'll do! Ah! I'm finally going to know what I came here looking for! It's not that I'm suspicious... ...but you also have to tell me a certain sentence so that I'm sure. "The elephant is in the boiled egg" Good... it is indeed Chartier who sent you. So... You have that certain thing? Well then... - I don't have it anymore! - What?! It's a joke! What've you done with it? I left it with my friend Giuseppe Cameleoni. And where is he, this Giuseppe Cameleoni? In Calabria, in Cavaleria. So now I have to go to Calabria! Write me a note for this Giuseppe. Impossible because first of all, I can't write... ...and I made him swear not to give it to anyone but me, in person. Good, in that case, you'll come with us. Yes right now, I'll change and come with you. You don't make things easy for me. Why did you get rid of that certain thing? For reasons of personal convenience and internal security. Here the Mafia is everywhere, so you know what, we talk like this... So when the words reach ears that should not have heard them... There you go! What did I tell you... they're here! - What do you want from me? - You're a traitor, Tonio! You sold us out to the cops! For that, we condemned you to death! But I can't die now. Listen, it's impossible, I have guests! Come down or we'll break down the door! Oh please God, don't let them do this to me! I never spoke to the cops. And don't talk like that to God... You know very well he's in the Mafia! Please keep them back for a few minutes. I don't like mixing in local feuds... ...but if I can help you escape... Yes! Thank you! I will be back soon. I'll leave a message at the dry cleaners who are on the square. So... Are you coming down? In that case, we're coming up to get you! What are we going to do? And what do we tell the others downstairs? What I'll tell them... Gentlemen! Gentlemen, I'm sorry, but... I won't beat about the bush... You won't find Tonio Cotoni here now. He's no longer up there. I came to kill him and I fired three shots at him. He escaped me but... I will find him! Be sure of that. We'll check! Come on! Lock me up! They want to assassinate me! This is not a hostel! Put me in jail to protect me! - I want to be arrested! - We don't arrest just anyone! - First you have to commit a crime. - An offense? That's enough! - I'll give you a cell for a while! - You saved my life! One moment. Hey Pierrot, come here! Right away! I'm coming! Come on, that's enough! Uniatz, old man! What happened to you? What happened to me? So what happened to me... In London, just before arriving at the MacMish boarding school... ...and when I came round, I had a head like that! A monkey wrench on my knees... ...and a note pinned to my jacket. "Do not touch FRAGILE" But if I ever catch her one day on my way! Uniatz. Poor little Uniatz. Oh! It's not true! Boss, tell me it's not true! Uniatz! Don't be ridiculous. Uniatz. My little Uniatz. Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you. Lets be friends, Uniatz. Since she apologizes, forgive and forget. Shake hands... Firmly! This time, we have them both! They are three of them. Yes and the Saint counts as four, so, watch out! There are 3 of them. It doesn't matter, I'll pay you a little extra. Yes, there'll be a supplement. Thanks. Sir! Sir! Mr Tonio said to tell you he's in jail. That's 100 lira. -Well worth it! You'll show us the way, eh? Come on! Uniatz, Sophie... Off to jail! Boss, boss, wait for me! The swine! They're going to Palermo Prison. If that bastard gets there, it will no longer even be possible to execute him in the name of God and Sicily! He's a dead rat in Palermo! Come on! Let's go! I'd like to talk to Mr Cotoni. He just left in the van for Palermo. Ah thank you. Quick Uniatz, take the wheel! And catch up with the van! - He mustn't arrive in Palermo! - What are you going to do? - Attack the stagecoach? - Maybe. Tremendous! The Wild West in the heart of Sicily! Make a U-turn! Turn around there! Fast! Here they are! Uniatz! So... You drive parallel to the van... As close as possible. And you leave it to me. Good boss! What are you doing, Giorgio? Put the car in front and get them out of the van! Come on, sweetheart... Uniatz!... ...take the first road to the right! Tonio! He's maybe scared to death! he Mafiosi! -Tonio! -God, have pity on my old Mamma! What is he saying! Open to me now! It's me, Simon Templar! The elephant is in the boiled egg. Sir! I'm here! Open to us! It doesn't open from inside, idiot! If only... ...I knew where they kept the keys. We should set fire to it! Why not blow everything up with dynamite! Come on, leave us... Go watch! Okay, but give me a gun, I never keep watch without a revolver! Come on, no more chatter. Oh but I would've liked so much to shoot down a cop or two! Come on! Uniatz! Break down this door for me, but gently! Very gently! Act like you were pretending. Okay boss, I'll just touch it... gently. Where did he go? Oh God! Saint Leonard! I think I died! You're alive! The Mafia never forgive and I know I'm going to die! You've nothing to fear because we'll be staying with you. You're going to be nice and take us to your friend Giuseppe's place. Giuseppe... for the... The giraffe! Exactly! I got a gun! It's mine! Is this where Mr Giuseppe Cameloni lives? That's right. Tell him that Tonio Cotoni would like to say hello. You haven't heard the news? The news? - What news? - Giuseppe is dead! - He's dead? - Yes, he's dead! - Giuseppe dead? - Yes! - How could he be dead? - He’s dead! He’s dead! Dead... Giuseppe! But... Truly dead? Absolutely dead! Giuseppe's dead. Giuseppe's dead... but who are you? Me? Agatino Camelino, his brother. Agatino! Agatino! Giuseppe's brother! Simon Templar... my condolences. - Condolences. - Lovely to make your acquaintance. Condolences. Why? Why is Giuseppe dead, why?! Sorry... but that's life! He always knew how to lead a good life! Money! Women! Children. Not too much work. And very happy. Very happy. And then... he'll come back! Careful! Sorry! When I think that it's Giuseppe who died! And he left us here alone! I wish I could bury him with you! Well, that will be for another time. Everybody dies. Caesar died! Al Capone died! Garibaldi died! Napoleon died! Oh that Giuseppe wasn't dead! Look at this man... he's crazy! Completely crazy. This is his apartment. I set it up. Nothing's changed. He's no longer here, that's all! And as he was always outside... so... And now he's inside. Yes! So what now? Tell me what it is you want. The elephant is in the boiled egg. But what does that mean? I'll explain. The elephant... elephant ...is in the boiled egg. Elephant? Boiled egg? Weren't you left a message? Yes! Yes Yes! There's a letter to be delivered to... to a certain... Tonio Cotoni. Yes! It's us! So all's well! So give it to us, we are very busy. Yes... yes... one moment! I put it away in the drawer. No. No. E morto Giuseppe! E morto Giuseppe! Where did I put it? Where? We have to find it! We absolutely have to find it! I'll find it! How? Trust me. Behind the cabinet. Giuseppe! Giuseppe! When I think that he lived here all his life! And that from this window he saw the sun rise! Mafiosi! Mafiosi! They're the ones! Oh, help me! Help me, Help! Down there...! Look at that, he's absolutely crazy! I'm really sorry, I assure you, but... We have to find the document! I'm sure it's still here in the apartment. Maybe we should have looked more. I regret that poor Giuseppe was dead before you arrived! O what heat! What heat! The dead! The dead! I don't believe it's ever been so hot! Oh I can't take it anymore! - May I. - Please. Please. Oh! The document! That's it! Finally we shall find out where that treasure is! That's it? So that's that. Well? That's that. It's over? We're going back home? Sorry. You're welcome. Feel at home! I needed to relax a bit. We now need go to Romantica. It seems the last link in the chain is in the hands of a Mr Pavone. Pavone? Commandatore Pavone? Forgive me Sir, for bothering you. Oh, you're welcome, I'm delighted by your visit, I assure you. And I'll remember it all my life! Miss... Your father is even more tortuous than you might think. - Good bye, Sir! - Oh no! No no no! Have a good trip! Things weren't working out for Chartier either. He'd found a way to be recaptured, but this time by the Americans. And like all services secrets are alike... Same interrogation, same methods. Colonel Wade had to realise... ...Chartier had undergone brainwashing. He entrusted him for review to the house-psychiatrist. At Romantica... ...the Grand Hotel of the Commandatore Pavone. All had just one idea in mind... Get Sophie... ...who alone, they believed, could get them to find the dollars. Because the secret agents and the Sleemans are very smart! The proof being that they had not lost track of the Saint. I'd like to see Commandatore Pavone. Commandatore Pavone is not here. How come? He went for a cruise aboard the yacht of Prince Costelata de la Milanese. And when should he get back? Some time during the day. He just left. OK, I'll wait for him at the bar with my friends. Let me know when he's here... it's extremely important. Certainly, Sir. Them again! We run into them everywhere! The Saint is there with the girl! Go ahead and bring her back to me alive if possible. For safety's sake... ...I prefer not to show myself, I've dealt with him before. Hello, my friend, how are you?! So glad to see you! Goodbye. Commandatore Cesar Pavone? Yes, what is it? Quickly! I wish to say a particular word to you. You need to make an appointment. I'm very busy. Excuse me. - Wait, innkeeper! - What?! The elephant is in the boiled egg. The elephant is in the boiled egg? Oh! Excuse me sir! You've been lucky to find me here. My sea trip didn't happen. The yacht of my friend... Prince Peter Pentecostal of the Milanese, ...refused to leave. Let's go up to my apartment where we won't be disturbed. I'll be in my apartment! You've nothing to add? A small additional formality? To complete the code? Thanks! - Commandatore Pavone. - Simon Templar. My collaborator Uniatz. And Signorina Sofia. Glad to make your acquaintance, Miss. The pleasure is all mine. How lovely! This way... I'll introduce you to my wife Anita. My poor Anita fears shipwrecks! A fresh-water mermaid! A rose with no tomorrow. Come come! Quietly. Wait a moment. Anita! Inanity. She sleeps, maybe. Anita! Agrippina! Whore! The sailor's return! He did knock before entering, though. Excuse me. Quickly! Hurry! Yes send them now... Albert and Maurizio. Just like you are. So sensitive. Come on! Don't stay there, fool, get away! How? That way! Yes send them... Albert and Maurizio. Sorry to meet you dressed like this. - Anita Pavone. - Simon Templar. Hello. Ah, what a day! Were you here? You are witnesses... ...that I was quietly taking my physical-culture lesson. Physical culture? Yes. With Professor Ramini. An excellent teacher! He had me doing great exercises... ...when Cesare entered. Bingo...! Catalepsy! He always has a cataleptic fit when he has a shock. Oh, he seemed very calm. Oh... He's such a fragile being. So delicate. Come in! Quickly. Good. What do you expect from him? He never talked to you about an elephant? - An elephant? - Yes. And... ...a boiled egg? In the same conversation? No. I would've remembered. Okay, so we'll have to wait for him to come to his senses. You know how long it will it last? - Catalepsy? Usually, not more than 2 days. It depends of the violence of the shock. It's emotional, isn't it. You'll just have to stay here. Wait. No... Oh yes! Yes! I'm delighted to have met you. I can see that you've made use of physical culture, too! Yes! I do it as often as the opportunity arises. Marvelous! You don't know Romantica? Very pretty. I'm sure you'll leave it with very good memories. The little lady... ...will have to go out and exercise... ...in a pedal boat. Oh, of course! In a pedal boat! Everyone can't be doing the same gymnastics. Well, like it or not, I'm going for a swim! In a while. And never on your own! Why not now? We've plenty of time, right? Aren't you happy here? - Fine, I understand! - What? I don't know if the elephant is where you think it is. But the eye of The Saint is on a bikini, or I'm a monkey's uncle! La Pavone over there, ...the Viking is here.. Add add a cover for the girl. Who's kidding who?! Sophie! Sophie, come back here! - It's funny isn't it? - What's funny? I don't know you, you don't know me. -That... We do not know each other. And I smile at you, you smile. All has been said! All what? Oh, nothing compromising. That the weather is beautiful, the sky is kind to us and we're happy. We needn't describe what we both experience. I'm always stuck for some thing to say. And most of the time I don't realise that I exist... You stay calm being like that! There are enough of the others! You're on vacation here? - It depends. - On what? Lots of stuff! And after... Where are you going? It depends. And you, are you here for long? Maybe yes, maybe no. Mr Templar! Hey! Mr Templar. It's for my boss. I'll give it to him. - Is Mr Templar your boss? - Yes. Oh, you have a handsome boss and a nice lighter! Can you give me a light? Well, you see, she doesn't need you! She got a light. Boss! - I'd like you to meet Miss... - Monica. - Simon Templar. - I was telling this gentleman... ...how much I loved Romantica. Oh... For you boss. Excuse me. Me too, I really like Romantica. There are some very nice places here. Dear Sir and new friend, come alone to my place at 10 tonight. I have something very important to show you... ...and that I hope will make you happy. Anita Pavonne. Ah ha! Tonight at 10 the Saint will go to Mrs Pavone! Wonderful! At 10, the Saint will be at Mrs Pavone's, you understand, right?! At 10, the Saint will be at Madame Pavone's. This woman is one of the most famous active volcanoes in Italy! While the Saint is on his excursion, you'll kidnap the girl. And by midnight, I'll hear that it's all over! Okay, boss! Let's go dancing! There must be a nightclub in this country! No. Realise, Miss, that we're not here to have fun. Well, I want to go dancing! Go to bed, sleep! And dream you're dancing with Uniatz. That's a nightmare! - Boss! I don't have a bed! - How don't you have a bed? No, I don't have a bed! Is that a toothbrush? I would have thought of anything but that! Let's not exaggerate! Not in bed yet? At 9.45?! What a pain! You'll do as I say and get undressed and go to sleep! I'll do as I please! It's true! I can't take a step without a pair of amateur cops. But I have the right to my own life! On my own, like anyone else! And I won't go to bed! If, in two minutes, you are not lying on your pretty white sheets... ..I take you on my knee, like this... ..and I spank you like this! As a test! And a sample! And next time it's Uniatz! Who'll take over this pleasant chore! And respect for the human person? Dear Sophie, I have precisely the responsibility of your human person! And with a number of your kind... ...is it my fault, that we're in this situation? And if Mr-Your-Father... What? What about "Mr-My-Father"? What's your problem with my father? Just a moment. - What are you doing? - Hush! What are you looking for? Yeah. Obviously... That's what I'd warned your father. When the Germans... ...learn that Americans and when the Americans learn that the Germans... And they learned! Sleeman didn't accept being taken advantage of, either. Oh Sleeman, that one! I'll won't forget him in a hurry. Americans... Germans... Unfortunately, microphones have no face. How to identify them? - Uniatz! - Yes Boss? 10 minus 3. I've a meeting with someone who's going to show me some very interesting things. I believe that tonight will be very rewarding. He's going to find Monica! And that's what he calls "rewarding"! I said go to bed! I'm counting to three! Alright, I'm going, but what an existence! And you Uniatz, good fairy, watch over the sleep of this innocent! Yes Boss! Go now! Go for it! And how's the Commandatore? We gave him an injection to calm him down. He sleeps like a baby. Oh well, good for him! - And for us... - And for us! Oh... You'll find me very curious and very impatient, but... Your letter intrigued me. It was surely very clear. Woman's letters don't highlight everything they say between the lines. Of course not. We understand the hints, but... This important thing... that you want to show me... You've guessed everything... understood! That thing is done, it's not spoken! - Oh but... - Hush... We can talk about it... a lot during... ...a little bit after... ...but never before! The Grand Desires are dumb! This thing... ...take it... without my giving it to you! That's so much nicer. Oh... I suspected that... I had a one in 100 chance to get what I came for. Well, this chance out of 100... ...enjoy it! Take it despite me! You thief! -Excuse me. Forgive me Anita... But... For me... Love... is not a game of chance. You, you are someone lovely Lovely... - but... - But? No, Anita. On second thoughts, no. No but... Thank you for the consideration. But what did you come looking for, here? What did you come looking for? A lost opportunity... You do this to me!? In my own home?! If I'm refraining, it's because I respect you too much Anita. You obnoxious individual! When my husband's not here to defend me... ...you insult me to my face! Go to hell! Imbecile, moron...! Hush. He's sleeping. The gag there, in his mouth. What are you doing here, who are you? What about you? But... And you? Hurry up... we are suffocating here! - Get out! - We were here first! But I know you! - I've seen you somewhere! - Oh, shut up! Shut up or not... I have the impression we're here for the same thing... The girl upstairs. We are on the same case. Possibly. But we're not the only ones. There's another contender over there... Behind the curtains. He's coming towards us. What'll we do? - Do we kill them? - No. Leave it to me. - Who are you? - Shut up! Don't try to understand! You're here for the girl, so are we. Then we'll share. OK. Go gringo! He knows how to do it... it's his profession. Fortunately, I haven't lost my touch! Stop! Stop! Let's get the hell out! It missed! Uniatz! Uniatz! What's the matter?! Oh, it's you! You scared me. So you can't leave me alone for five minutes! We need to agree what we want! How and why. Yes, we have to agree... ...between all of us. Chartier sold me a 500,000 dollar document... ...for which I'm responsible! No! Oh the bastard! Yes, Sir... an AKW223 document! He sold us the same document for the same price! - No!? - Yes! He doubled, eh? Yes, but the document he sold to us was fake! - No!? - Yes sir! Mine was, too. He doubled on doubled what! You see that we did well to explain ourselves. But me too... he got me for 500,000! But what am I saying? 1 million dollars for the same thing! And my government is not happy at all! ??? But, was the document fake too? That, I can assure you! Maybe Chartier didn't know. Possible. He's still sold it multiple times. If I get hold of that scoundrel! What a party that would be! The electric chair, Sir! The electric chair! Chartier must have put all that cash somewhere. But where? I still think the key to this will be given to us by Chartier's daughter. - That's what we've always said. - Always. But between her and us there's The Saint! And he's a big stumbling-block! I have a plan. And, Miss... Monica. Miss Monica can be of great use to us. As our great poet Goethe said in French... What's it about? To eliminate The Saint. Hello... Yes? Monica? Yes I remember... at the beach. No. No... right now? Right away? No... I wasn't sleeping. You won't believe me, but I was just thinking of you. Yes Monica. Yes Monica. But of course Monica, but at least tell me your room number. 123. - Oh, gosh! - Shut up! Uniatz, shut her up! No, I won't be silenced! - Yes Monica. But yes but... I too am very romantic. I'm coming. Well that is Sleeman. That... I don't know yet. But this one... Ahh that one! That one, is another thing! You can't go to that horrible girl at such an hour! It's shameful! You can wish me a very good night! Good night! Good night! You're shameful! And at your age! Schmutz! Hurry up! He won't be long. Wait behind the curtain. I'll bring him here. And at the moment where I say "Darling, I love you!" - Bop! - OK. Here he is! Good luck! Yes? Good evening! You must think I'm mad! Yes, but I must be likewise. The moment I saw you on the beach... I said to myself... frankly... I said to myself that because I'm a girl... fast, direct and without hangups... And who takes risks. You please me. All day long I thought of you. Ah... I'm sorry for not calling you sooner! What a waste of time! - And life's so short, right? - Well... It's not so much it's short, than... ...time flies! It's good how fast it goes! It urges us to live, darling! I love you! Missed! Sweet dreams! Hello Mr Saint! We'll finally be able to chat nicely! If possible... I'm not very talkative, usually. We have a saying... "Always much more than we'd like!" - Maybe you've things to talk about... - A lot of them. You're in luck to have scored me! I'm a good-natured chap. I could kill you. But I don't like corpses. That's at least one disgust we have in common. So I'm asking you as a favour not to force me to execute you! Although I have the possibility. Someone else would take the opportunity. Me no. You'd be making a very bad deal. If I were dead, I'd be recalcitrant and non-negotiable. What are you doing with Chartier's daughter? Having a pleasure trip. No, a trip of interest. You know where the dollars are! And if he doesn't know and you know, I want to know what you know! What was that? Can you repeat that last sentence... ...it sounded very funny. Do you understand now?! You will answer yes or no?! It will be... Shit! With your permission. Extras will be on the house... I give you 30 seconds to answer! Hey! I think that's it! Mueller-Strasse got The Saint! We just have to pick him up! I'll stay behind you to cover you. If Mueller-Strasse, got the bad guy... ...waste him, eh! Don't forget... knock him off! The fewer we are, the more we earn! Come on! Okay boss! Go on! Okay boss. Come in! Bon giorno Signore. Put it there. Prego Signore. Waiter... Your tea is way too strong for me! A stuff-up, I believe. - Commandatore... - Oh, it's you! The elephant! Excuse me... I was taking a short nap. - Do you have the object? - Don't worry, here you are! I always wear it on me. Eco! Wait... here it is. - But it's a half! - Yes, but the other half... ...you will find it at Miss Hermine Gracieuse... ...in Champigny, near Paris. Don't forget, huh! Hermine Gracieuse in Champigny. Hush! Shut up! Goodbye and thank you Commandatore! See you soon! You can't stay for a bit? I'd have so much liked to introduce you to my wife. Well that'll be for another day. I'm extremely pressed for time. What a pity! Too bad for my little Anita! That's it! I have the key! Champigny, here we come! To do all those kilometers... Do you realise...! Without drinking, without eating, without sleeping, without... Without what? - Maybe we could stop for... - No way! We have half the key, we won't stop until we have the rest. Stop, with The Saint after us?! Do you think The Saint would stop to eat!? He must do like us: crunch bombs! - Good grief! - What? - Him! - But look yourselves! It's him, it's The Saint! He's gaining on us... Go faster! Accelerate! What are you waiting for? It's no good, I can't go any faster. Just do it! Oh, this is great! Faster, Zorro! If only I had lasso! Calm down! There they are! Look! Funny, eh? We must have passed them. They're behind us. What can we do now? You'll have the answer in a moment. They're coming! There he is! We'll pepper the Saint! -Damn! He's here! Hide! He's here! The bridge! The key! Where's the key? Just you and me, fatso! Good on you, Sophie! Hey Uniatz! By car! We're beaten! We're beaten. Do what you want, but I give up. One has to be a good sport... I throw in the towel! The White House will understand me. Oh Sicily! Calabria, France. It won't be there that I'll spend my holidays. It's over, huh! I'll write off those dollars! Look at me now! I've lost ten kilos! One million dollars and ten kilos! This is too much for a single man! Well I think the time has come to separate. I'm going back to Berlin. Berlin is over there. And me, I'm going to London. It's this way. And me, to Paris. Paris is there... Straight ahead. Bye. Bye. Bye, and good luck! Let's hope that we'll be luckier next time! However, the union was a good idea. I have the clear impression we'll see no more of those gentlemen. Let's hope so! Next step, Herminie! That's your style... "After Monica, Herminie!" You have to have them all... The cover-girl types... Gently! And lightly! Do. Do re mi fa sol fa mi sol fa mi... not re! Not re! mi mi Go back! And watch your wrists. Fingers in a hammer. Go on without me. Your wrists! The wrists! What is this? Mrs Herminie Gracieuse? Miss Herminie. Excuse me. So come in... You're welcome. Wipe your feet! I don't have a maid at the moment. -No, not re, again, mi! Mi! If you'd like to follow me. It's this way. - And light! Light. -Oh... Little virtuoso! First of all, the words. The elephant is in the boiled egg. Perfect! Good. Allow me to introduce myself: Simon Templar. The Saint! What a joy to meet you! I have always admired you! You're too kind. My collaborator, Mr Uniatz. Gently! Hello, Miss! With his respects, Miss. And finally, Sophia, Sophie Chartier. Oscar's daughter! Goodness, she is pretty! But she has a very complicated daddy! You are no doubt my dear child... ...the only thing in the world that he did simply. -Do, do, re, mi. Mi sol fa mi. Not re! Mi, mi! These little Mozarts... Piano executioners! Did you do have a good trip at least? A trip that showed us the country! I'll return the item to you. Have you got the other half of the key? - Here it is. - And here's the rest of it. What does it open? You'll find out. If you'll follow me... Oh what a beautiful cake! -It's for my birthday! A gift from my students! Oh, it's a garden. Yes, I have always loved botany. It's my Jean-Jacques Rousseau side. Each day, a new flower comes to charm our hearts and senses. Thereby God reveals his blessings to us. And we are reborn! Annoying old thing, eh? Seeing you, I wonder how and where... ...you could know a man like Oscar. -Oh... It's a very long story! But I fear it'd make this little girl repeat that I'm annoying. Here we are! In the grain bin. Uniatz! Yes Boss! Let's hope that we are going to have a good surprise! -Oscar didn't tell you anything? Nothing! I haven't seen him for 5 years! With its usual simplicity he made me deliver this chest. With the key, an explanatory note... ...by a Little Sister of the Poor... ...accompanied by a police captain. That's good of him! Dollars! But it's a fortune! A fortune it is. A very big fortune! I wonder how Oscar managed to earn so much money! -He is a hard worker. Is he such a complicated boy? Where will you take this trunk? To a safe place at home in Scotland. When I think that it is I who'll one day inherit everything! God willing, Sophie! God willing. The ways of Providence are unpredictable! Miss... thank you for your lovely welcome! The elephant really was in the boiled egg! Bye Madam! Miss! Good bye, young lady! You are definitely progressing. Away you go! Sol fa mi. Sol fa mi. I won't stop listening to you. Yes? I am Simon Templar, called The Saint, and I come to seek what you know. You are aware. Yes I am aware. You are welcome. Wipe your feet. - Wipe! - Oh yes yes. I'm without a maid at the moment. It's this way. Please, after you. It's this way. I'll be right with you! A little Mozart! Little Wolfgang Amadeus! Schoen Musik! That looks nice! Madam, I wish you a happy birthday! - Me too! - Oh... Mozart! What is it? Simon Templar, perhaps? That's me! And you came to get it? - That's correct. - Quick, come in and be welcome! Wipe! Oh, excuse me, I don't have a maid right now. You're excused. It's this way. I'll be right with you! I sense good music here! Oh such a beautiful cake! I could eat it! - Enjoy your food! - Oh! What is it? Ah finally! I was sure you'd come today! Simon Templar, without a doubt... - Yes Madam. - Miss! Come with me please. Wipe your feet! Yes yes. Oh, wipe my feet!! My maid is at home. You have something... something to give me? Yes, Mr Templar. I'll be with you very soon! You are welcome. This way. I'll be right with you. What a nice garden! -Oscar! You're all that was missing... Come in my little one! But what's wrong? You look so strange. I'm an escapee. An escapee. An escapee? The Germans, the Americans, like that! -I'd lost freedom, my memory. And I've recovered everything! A real miracle! And then... I have moral sense. Don't talk nonsense and wipe your feet! Still mad about that, eh? You haven't changed! Oh, I haven't changed... I haven't changed, morally. The looks have taken a bit of a hit! Herminie, your looks... At least I wasn't expecting you! Sit down, let's talk a bit. - Would you like a little Martini? - That'd be nice! - It's nice here at your place. - No, it's a bit crummy. But what more could I want, now I've settled down. Prison is alright when you're 20 years old. Can't spend your whole life in the clink. Do you remember when we ripped off the guy who had a lottery win? - Yeah. - 80,000! I remember. - It wasn't very legal, eh! - To put it mildly! I'm so happy to see you! Let's talk about the little chest. - The chest? - Well yes, the box! You're joking, right? The Saint has just been here with your daughter. The Saint? And he took the money? He had the key, the code, the sign, everything. everything, what! He told you where was he going? Yes. To Scotland. Chartier! My pal! What's happened to you? Have you lost your mind? No, I found it! In Germany, I'd been brainwashed too much. Thank God the Americans, proceeded with the same operation... ...but in reverse! And they made me an honest man. Yes! They gave me a soul! I don't want to live in shame, anymore! But in honour! Fool! Between shame and honour, only the spelling is different! Honour what crimes were committed in your name! I would restore to the secret service... ...the dollars that I cheated out of them! You deserve a good lesson. - I'm keeping the dollars for myself! - What?! I went to so much trouble to get them back! Two whiskies Mike! And as I'm very kind... I'll put a part aside for Sophie's dowry. I want to be an honest man! He's gone crazy! As one can't antagonize madmen, I'll find you an honest occupation. Night watchman in a bank! This way you'll watch over money well earned by billionaires. Just a moment... Hello? Uniatz? We have visitors... Take care of it. There are three. Visitors at this hour? Yes! Old friends of mine. So does that position suit you? Night watchman? Yes. Live in honesty and obscurity. One is wrong without the other. Some people just never know when to give up. Where are those bastards... I'll kill them! So! This is how I love you... Oscar the Tortuous! It's definitely true that broken glass brings good luck! What's happening? What have I done? Nothing! A nightmare. You were dreaming you become honest. - It's not true! - Not since I told you. Since when do you "tu" me? I must be dreaming! To be "tu" by The Saint! You well deserved it! Boss! What do we do with them? Freshen them up. Okay boss. And here's the third! What'll I do with it? Leave it there. Uniatz will take care of it. And there you are... this job finally wrapped up! We'll just wait for the next one. Trust me, I'll find you a hot deal! Oh no! No, later. Some rest. But next time, you'll take me with you again? Yes. If you're very well behaved... ...and you follow your dad’s example! Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
