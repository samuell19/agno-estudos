Let's get him out and into the grave. Necati, you get down there, too. Careful now. Easy does it. Easy. Don't rush. Easy now. Undo the ties. Okay. You can close up the shroud. Turn him to the right. Necati, you come out. Mine's nicer, isn't it? I'm going into second gear now. Look! You broke it! I'm going to tell Grandpa. Grandpa, look. He broke the wheel. We'll get you a new one. A nice one, okay? Condolences, Necati. That's great, Fatma. Thanks. I did the dishes, too. Thanks. And the leftovers are in the fridge. Help yourself to whatever you fancy. I'll stop by tomorrow. No need, Fatma. There's nothing much left to do. I can take care of it, don't worry. Good night then. Thanks. Call if you need anything. Good night. I will. Good night. Thanks. Son, go to bed. You've got school tomorrow. I'm not sleepy. What are those cards, Bekir? Soccer cards. How come you have collected so many? They give you a bike when you have collected enough. A bike? Rasim from school, his cousin got one. So will I. Only I can't get cards for Sergen and Metin. Grandpa would have got me a bike if he hadn't gone away. It would have had streamers on the handlebars. And tassels. Of course he'd have got you one, but he's gone now. He can't come back either. Where did he go? Can he really not come back? Grandpa went to the moon. So is Grandpa the man in the moon now? That's right, son. He's the man in the moon. So is he in the sky now? Yes, he's in the sky. Where else would the man in the moon be? Come here. Come on, come here. My precious. My little treasure. My sweetheart. Bekir, Bekir! Where did you get that? From up the street. You didn't come yesterday. We said we'd play cards. I didn't feel like it. Where did you go? What's it to you? - Did you do your maths homework? - No. What if the teacher gets angry? She can get stuffed. Say your grandpa died. Then she might let you off. Ümit's dad got him a bike. Why doesn't your dad get you one? He hasn't got the money. He would otherwise. Maybe this summer. Wouldn't that be awesome? I have brown eyes like my dad. I have my mum's curly hair and a lot of her ways. My brother is blond and blue-eyed like my mum. But he has my dad's ways. Please talk about your family now. Is that clear? - Yes, teacher. - Well done! Ali, what are you looking at? There's a horse outside, teacher. A horse? Ali, face the front. Open your homework. What did you write? My mum, my dad and me. My dad's tall, dark and going bald. He likes reading the paper, walking and travelling. My mum's blonde with curly hair and blue eyes. My mum likes crosswords, knitting and reading. I'm going to be tall like my dad. I like reading, swimming and travelling. Ali, who did your homework? My brother. Stand up. Tell the whole class who did it. My brother, teacher. Sit down. Bravo, Ali. Bravo! Keep up the good work! Quiet! Bekir! Bekir, I'm talking to you! Sit down. Meryem, you read yours. My dad's name is Muhittin. My dad does manual labour. He builds walls. He's also a plasterer. He also digs foundations. My dad can do anything. My mum's a housewife. Well done. Now, if your grandma and grandpa have a son, what relation is he to you? Uncle! And if your grandma and grandpa have a daughter, what relation is she? Aunt! Go on, Hasan. So what's a brother-in-law, teacher? Okay, quiet! That's enough. Don't disrupt the class. I'll explain brothers-in-law in another class, Hasan. Now sit down. Pay when you have money. I've put the pattern in, but please bring it back. - I will. - Everyone wants it. I'll make a copy and bring it back. - Okay. - Okay. I'll write down the amount. Pay me when you can. What have you been up to? Nothing really. What are you doing on your own? I just went to pay the bills. I thought I'd stop by, to see Rabia. If you need anything, tell Rabia and she'll tell me. Just let me know. Okay, I will. Thanks. You're okay, aren't you? - Fine, thanks. - Good. I've a few aches and pains in my knees. - But nothing serious? - No. It's to be expected. Is anything ever painless? That's life for you. Of course it is. - Keep well then. - Thanks. Thanks for stopping by. Come on, let's go. Come on. - Goodbye, Rabia. - Goodbye. - Good luck. - God willing. - Thanks. - See you. - Goodbye, Dürdane. - Thanks for coming. Goodbye. What's with that sparkly wool? Where's she going to use it? Don't say that! It's nice for her grandchildren. And only her grandchildren. You don't know her, Rabia. She's a nasty piece of work. If you knew what she does to her daughter-in-law! What do I care? She isn't nasty to me. This is a small place, Rabia. You should watch who you talk to. You must see people for what they are. You're right. You should look around and keep an eye on your neighbours. You know what I just found out? Osman's wife ran off with another man last week. Which Osman? The mechanic. The one with a shop down the street. Him. So, his wife has done the dirty with Dur Ali's youngest son. She packed up her things, marched out and disappeared into the dawn. They give us a bike if we get them all, don't they? Sure. What if we can't get the card for Sergen? We'll have to win it. Who from? No one's got it. Bekir! Slow down, son. Here, I'll help you. - I can do it. - No, come here. Look, it's come unstitched. The thread's come loose. Stand still. That's not how it comes off. Honestly! You keep wriggling about. Stop it! Let me undo the button. Move your hands away. Just keep still! Arms up! Why are you so stubborn? I'm hungry. Did you eat your lunch? Yes. Today marks the first anniversary of the destruction... of the ancient Mostar Bridge in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Come on, son. Eat up. I am. Then what's that on your plate? I have things to do. Now come on. Finish that up. Bosnians killed in the war have been commemorated in Sarajevo. I think they're here at last. Who says they have to land in America? What is that? He's come for you guys. He's not a monster. He'd eat us if he was. This is... This is... Let's call you... Buddy. Buddy is here for you, kids! Your extra-terrestrial friend and hero. He's like out of a fairytale. Take those off before I whack you! Stop, Dad! He's an alien. Kids, get your bikes ready. We're flying to the moon! We like you. And you like us back. Bekir, take this through. - I'll be right there. - Not cheese again! What's that supposed to mean? Here, I cut up some tomato for you. There's your milk, there's honey, jam. I want Saussage! Sausage? You only had it last week. You can't have it every day. I'm not eating that stuff! Grandpa's dead. I'm left with everything. You know how much sausage costs? Grandpa isn't dead. He went to the moon. You said so. He did, he went to the moon. Of course he did. So, if Grandpa sees you from the moon, he'll be very upset. Will he really? Of course. He'll be upset that you're not eating. Come on now, Bekir. Can he see us? Of course he can. All the time. He can see us all the time. Then seeing me eat sausage will make him happy. I want sausage. What damn sausage? There is no sausage! But I said I want sausage! God give me patience! Then starve! - No! - I've had it up to here! - Are you saving money? - Yes, I am. But who'll give you money? My mum did this morning. I'll save that. Shall we save together? Okay. We can sell soccer cards, too. And bottle tops. I've got loads. So have I. I won them all. Okay, we're partners from now on. Promise you won't spend your money either? I promise, Bekir. We're going to get a bike. At ease! Attention! Good morning, everyone! Thanks! No talking. Quiet! Stand in line! Eda, how's it going? Bekir, what's going on with your hair? Get your mum to take you for a haircut. Okay, Bekir? Let me see your nails. How many times do I have to tell you? They need to be cut and cleaned, okay? Is that clear? Eda, I haven't seen your mum at school today. Mum isn't feeling well, teacher. She said she'd stay home and mark essays. Okay. Tell her I hope she feels better soon. Right. Let's have a look. She got three stars, look! Pass it over. Quiet! Everyone open their homework. Pass it over, Bekir. I got two stars. So what? Bekir, read out your homework. My mum's 28. She used to work with Grandpa. We have a shop... a shop... a shop... in the village. She works there alone now. She has fair skin. She has dark eyes. She cooks eggplant. She gets angry when I don't eat my food. She's really good at cooking sausage. But she doesn't always cook it. Grandpa used to smell really nice. He had prayer beads and a skullcap. He made streamersout of bottle tops. He was going to get me a bike. Tell us about your dad, too. Come on, Bekir. Teacher, I didn't write about my dad. Why not? He's dead so I didn't know what to write. Welcome, Fatma! Come on in. Thanks. How are things? Fine. Same as usual. How about you? Fine. I was bored at home so I thought I'd drop by. Good for you. Have a seat. What's up? Are you okay? Rabia, your brother-in-law is asking about the inheritance. The inheritance? But Dad's only just died. What's the rush? I said the same, but he wouldn't listen. Still, he has a point. It wouldn't hurt to get it over with. Dad hardly left anything anyway. But what would people say? There'd be gossip. Let them say what they like. It's none of their business. What do I care? Well, okay. How will we split it? We can come over this evening, the two of us... and talk it through. How about that? Okay, if you say so. Fine. What else can I say? There's something up with you, Rabia. What? I don't know, but there's something going on. What colour bike shall we get? Red? No, not red. Orange. Oguzhan's bike is orange. Ours should be different. Let's get one like Eda's. What, pink? Just kidding. That's a girly colour. We'll get a black one... and call it Knight Rider. Right, and we can write Knight Rider on it. The handlebar streamers can be red. We'll wash it every day so it's always nice and shiny. Exactly. Who'll get to keep it? - I will. - What about me? Only sometimes, not always. How will I get to ride it then? We can take turns during the day. I'll take it home at night. I love Eda. Aren't we going to play cards? We'll play bottle tops. There's no sparkle left in these eyes, nor life in these knees. I'm on a one-way ticket to the grave. It's just a question of when. God forbid! Don't talk like that. Why drag out a miserable life all on my own? But you've got me. You'll know what I mean when you get old. Listen, girl. You need a man and plenty of kids running around. How long's it been since your husband died? Look, you're almost past it. What's this all of a sudden? It's hardly all of a sudden. Open your eyes a little, Rabia. Look around. But who'd be interested in a widow with a young boy? There are widows with children and no widowers? Huh? Well, there are widowers out there. Of course there are. But as I say, only if you open your eyes. You'd do well to look around a little. Then you'll see. If God wills it. God's will only works with effort on your part. How old are you now? And you need someone to put out that fire! How can you say that? God forgive you. - Two. - Nine. - Seven. - Four. Four! I hit the middle! I win them all. Ümit, let's keep playing. I don't have any left. How about you, Oguzhan? No way. You always win. Whoa, the Metin card! Ümit, if you let me ride your bike once... I'll give your cards back. What, all of them? - All except Metin. - Okay, but not for long. I'll just go down there and back. - Take your cards back. - Don't be long, though. Okay! I just said I'd be quick. Hasan, want a ride? Sure, if you let me ride. You ride then. I'll stand behind. Okay, go! If you both ride it, the tyres will go flat! It'll be fine! - Good scam to nick his bike, huh? - I'm flying! Oguzhan's following. Bekir! Hasan! Stop! Ümit and the others are coming. Look at Ümit running! Hey, stop! Stop! The tyre's flat! What are we going to do? Ümit, they've given you a flat tyre! Don't shout! Is it your bike? Hey, what have you done? You gave me a flat! Don't run away! Son of a bitches! It was a good ride, huh? I wish you'd had a go. But you said you wanted to ride. Ümit's a real crybaby. He got a flat tyre. His dad's a mechanic. He'll fix it. He'll beat Ümit? No. Ümit's mum ran off, right? He'll let Ümit off. - Where did she run off to? - No idea. Who told you? I heard my mum say. Why would mums run off? Why wouldn't they? My mum never has. Neither has mine. Where would she go anyway? I wish Eda had seen us on the bike. But you weren't riding it. Still, it would've been nice. Grandpa would've got me a bike if he hadn't gone. Where did he go? - To the moon. - The moon? Yes. The moon. Who told you that? My mum. He's the man in the moon now. Who's going to start? Kerim. Bekir can go second, me third, Hasan fourth and Ferhat fifth. Go on, play! I'm about to if you just shut up. I almost hit the front row! Out the way! I'll show you. You hit the front row, Bekir. Two each. What's going on? I'm not playing if you do. Why not, Ümit? You gave me a flat tyre. That's not why we're here. I came to sell my cards. - What, all of them? - Yes. Mine are in there, too. What cards have you got? There's Feyyaz, there's Metin, there's Tanju. There's 152 cards. Have you got Oguz? Of course! Look. See? I'm not buying them. Don't you either, Oguzhan. Don't tell Oguzhan what to do. How much do you want? - Seven thousand. - That's a lot. A lot? It's even on the low side! I'd never pay that. Watch it, Oguzhan. They'll rip you off. Rubbish! You'd pay more buying them from the shop. Seven thousand is too much. I'll give you five. Okay! Deal. Hand over the cards. - Money first! - I don't have it on me. Then bring it to school and I'll give you the cards. - Okay. - But no backing out later. - Okay, no backing out. - Shall we play? You go first. Not this time. No one's going to find them here, are they? Not a chance. When shall we sell them? Let's get a few more first. Where to hide the money? No one should know about this except you and me, okay? Okay. Take this. Bekir. Come here, nephew. You're the sinless. You pick for us. Here. Here you go. How am I supposed to pick? Son, she wants you to pick a piece of paper from the bowl. We must both accept whatever turns up. Pick one for your mum first. You get the field in the village and the house there, Rabia. House? This... So, do you get this house and the shop? That's right. That's what the boy picked. We agreed to draw lots. We said we'd accept whatever turned up. But... how am I supposed to work a field in the village as a woman on my own? And there's the boy to look after. You know how long I've been looking after the shop. Let's pick again, I beg. We agreed from the start, Rabia. We agreed to accept. That's your lot. We can't do it again. You must accept it. I'll go and check on the tea. Did your dad ever treat you like a daughter? Has she ever stood by you as a sister? Stop being soft. If I say no, I mean no! Bekir. Come on, son. We'll be late. Come on! Look at you, closing your eyes. Up you get, sweetheart. Please. Come on. Come on now, son. I'm not getting up. You'll be late for school. - I'm not going to school. - What are you talking about? Why won't you get up? Stop that. Bekir, what's this? Have you wet the bed? - Little pee-pants! - I didn't wet it, Mum! Don't call me pee-pants! - Pee-pants! - Stop it! Look, it's soaking. How old are you and you still wet the bed! You could've kept the plastic undersheet on! Now I'll have to wash the whole lot. Why did you take off the plastic? It made a noise at night. So I took it off. Great! I still have go to work. Get up so I can wash you. Now get to the bathroom. Don't sit on your pee again! Take this off. You'll be late for school. Little monster! Don't take them off! Take off your underpants. - No! - Take them off! How am I supposed to wash your willy? - I'm not taking them off! - Do as I say! Take them off! You'll burn yourself. Stop holding it. Come here. - That burned me! - The hell it did! - Don't look! - Don't look at what? That burned! You're something else! Come here. Mum, my eyes! There's soap in my eyes. Wait. Okay. Here, bend over. Come here. Son... Son, just stand still. Wait! Keep still! I can't wash you like this. Don't look. Look at what, for goodness sake? You are a pee-pants! - I'm not a pee-pants! - Yes, you are! You go. I can wash myself. I've had it with you, I swear I have. - Wash the soap off. - Go! - Wash all the soap off. - Okay! Go! Got the money, Oguzhan? Yes. Have you got the cards? Let's have the money. They're all here, right? Yes, 152 cards. - Shall we count the money? - Of course. One thousand. Two thousand. Three thousand. Four thousand. Four thousand and a half. Five thousand. You think it's a bit dark? No, it looks okay. But try this one, too. It's a bit lighter. Hello there, Rabia. Welcome, Ayse. Thanks. - How are you? - Fine. How about you? - Fine. - How's the boy? He's okay. How's he doing at school? Fine. The same as ever. - I just thought I'd drop by. - Good for you. I'd like some of that red twine. It just came in. I've almost sold out. Really? - How many? There's two left. - I'll take them both. - You've got lots more wool in. - That's right. I'll take the purple. - Can you bring it over? - Okay. Wrap them, will you? I wouldn't mind some pink socks either. They'd be too small for you. Let me give you these bigger ones. Okay. - They'll keep you toasty. - Okay. - They are sparkly, too. - Yes, very. Anything else? No. How are things with you? - I've got what I need. - I'm okay. We can squeeze this in your bag. - Let me give you this one. - Okay. Shall I add this to your account? Yes, do that. I'll get more of that twine next time. - There'll be more coming in. - Okay, next time. I'll let you know when. Okay. Right. Have a good day. - Okay, see you soon. - Goodbye. What are you going to be? An engineer, teacher. An engineer? Why? My dad says so, teacher. Okay, sit down. Eda, what are you going to be? I'm going to be prime minister. Prime minister? Why's that? When I'm prime minister I'll make all children doctors. And I'll heal the sick. Good girl. Sit down. Bekir. What are you going to be? A fireman. Why a fireman? They play with water all day. Hasan, what about you? I'm going to be a butcher. Why a butcher? So I get to eat meat every day. Sit down. Oguzhan, what about you? I'm going to be an imam. An imam? Why's that? Because I'll get paid and be happy in this life... plus I'll get to pray and be happy in the next life. Stupid idiot! Teacher! Bekir's pulling my hair! Troublemaker! Did it hurt a lot? Of course it did. Is my face red? You can see her fingermarks. Nice job the teacher did beating you, Bekir! What's it to you? Eda's my best friend. You shouldn't have pulled her hair. - I didn't pull it. - Yes, you did. Moron! And he's smiling! Shall we play bottle tops? You and your bottle tops! No one plays with us! Your sister Fatma can't change a thing... Her husband cares about only money. Men are all the same. I bet they are. I bet they are. What's going on with you? What do you mean? What's with the new look? Who's it for? What are you talking about? I'm talking about all this. What's it for? Who's it for? I know... I know! I'll give you 17,500 for the lot. - Bring along more if you find it. - Okay. Okay. Where can we get more bottle tops? No idea. We can collect them. We can't collect that many. No one's playing either. I told you not to beat everyone all at once. That's rubbish! We can play cards. First win them, then sell them back. Yes! We'll make tons of money. Have you got any cards? Win, win, sell! Your ideas suck! Who told you to play with Ümit? Bekir, bring us more and let's win them, too! I haven't got any left. Bekir! Bekir! What? Bekir! What? What are you collecting? Metal stuff. What for? To sell to the junkman. You think he'd buy tyres? Of course. Why not? Then take these. Bekir! What's that in your hand? Look at me! I'm selling it to the junkman. Is this a junk house? What's with bringing it here? I told you, I'm selling it to the junkman. Why do you need to sell it to him? The junkman gives me money. Unlike you. What money? Give that to me. Bekir! Son! To hell with you! You're just like your dad. Little monster! Aren't you asleep yet? Not yet. Come on, go to sleep now. I'm getting a bike. So what? I'm going to call it Knight Rider. So what? Grandpa would've got me one if he hadn't gone. Did your grandpa get you yours? None of your business! Pea-brain! - Look at the cat. - It's beautiful. I drew one of its eyes. It was black, but I made it blue. It looks nice. - Who made your jumper? - My mum did. Who did your hair? My mum got me this as well. Why did you move my coat? What coat, Bekir? Don't pretend you don't know! Liar! So what if I moved it? Hang it somewhere else! Okay. I won't hang it there again. You bet you won't! I'll beat you up if you do! Okay. Come on, Hasan. Debt... Taxes... Confiscation... - Got any money? - No, of course not. - You've never got anything. - Have you? Of course. Here. Tell your dad to give you some money. Go away. You stink! What did she say to you? Fatma, please! Talk to my brother-in-law again. Let's split everything differently, please. Come on, you know how to talk to him. I've had a ton of official letters at the shop. How am I supposed to pay all those debts? A building contractor? Fatma, please. I beg you. How can I work that huge field as a woman on my own? Huh? And I have the boy to look after. Okay, fine. If you say so. No, OK. If you say so. What can I do in any case? Okay, Fatma. Okay. Whatever you say. It's up to you. Fine. Okay. You, too. Thanks. Bye. Go get some of that metal. We've got loads. It'll make us big money. Go get that cable there. It'll make more money. Hasan. Get the stuff on the other side. But only the cable. Bekir, that's enough, isn't it? No. There's more cable. Ümit and Oguzhan are coming. Where did you get all this? What's it to you? Ümit, can I have a go on your bike? No! You gave me a flat tyre. Don't look at our fire! Get lost! You shouldn't be lighting fires here. It's not your land. Yes, it is mine! Go! Or I'll set fire to your bike! Get away! You'll wreck my tyre again. Get lost! Hasan, get some wood. How much do you think he'll pay? At least 50,000. I hope so. It'll almost buy us a bike. How much do the bags weigh? A good kilo. Hey, isn't that your mum? So what if it is? What's in there? - Copper. - Hand it over. How much do you pay for copper? 10,000 lira per kilo. Let's say 20,000 for these. And 15,000 for the copper. That's 35,000 for the lot. You paid more before. The price of iron's gone down. Do you take tyres? Sure I do. Look at you counting, son of a bitch! Stick it in your pocket! Get out! Eat up. I'm not eating eggplant. Do as you're told. Eat it up. - No! - Bekir. Don't make me crazy. Eat your dinner. I want eggs, not eggplant. We don't have eggs. Eat that up or you'll go hungry. You never make anything. You don't give me money. You don't cook sausage. You don't cook eggs. What kind of mother are you? What did you say? That hurts! Stop pinching! Of course it hurts! Can you hear what you're saying? It's true. A mother is meant to look after her son. You just look at Osman the mechanic. What did you just say? What did you say, you little wretch? What did you say, Bekir? I'm telling the truth. I saw you today in front of his shop. Get out! Starve! Fine! I'll starve and I'll get out! I'm not eating anything you cook. The front row! See that, Oguzhan? This stone always hits the front row. So do I. Can't you see? But you're getting beaten. Three each. Oguzhan, lend me a few. No. I already gave you ten and you lost. Get some more and let's win them. Screw you and your stone! Forget playing with this stone again! This game doesn't count! Give me that, too. Don't ruin the game! Shut up! They're mine! Come and get them if you dare! Don't kick my bike! You'll scratch it! Screw you and your bike! Leave those tops behind! Get out of here or I'll smash your heads in! Son of a bitches! Hasan, pick them all up. 610 thousand, 615 thousand lira. Plus there's the coins. But it's not enough for a bike. We got a good haul of bottle tops, huh? We didn't, I got them. I did, too. The hell you did! Why you didn't join in the fight then? Take your trousers off in there. You've left a trail of dirt. It's the same every day. I've had enough. I'm sick to death of you. Good evening. Sorry to bother you at this time of day. But these kids are fed up. They've had it with your son. First, he gave my son a flat tyre. And I thought, okay, I'll let it go. But today he behaved like a total thug. He grabbed all their bottle tops... and then swore at them, too. I'm sorry. That's kids for you. Well, I... Sure, your boy is a child, but then so is mine. Get him out here. Bekir! Bekir! Get up. Get up and come with me. - What's wrong, Mum? - Get out there. I've done nothing wrong, Mum. Bekir, come on. Mum, it was his fault. Enough! You're to say sorry. No, never! Now, say sorry to your friend. No! Bekir, what's got into you? Say you're sorry. No! Dad, he ruined the game. I won the bottle tops and he threw my best stone away. It's in the field. Go find it! Son, I told you to say sorry. It's okay. I don't want an apology. But if it happens again, I'll just break his legs. Right, good night then. Get moving, go... - What did you do? - Nothing, Mum. Why are you doing this to me? Mum, I didn't. You're turning into a thug! Why are you doing this? Don't run away, little monster! Bekir! Come here, monster! Don't do it again, will you! - It hurts! Don't hit me! - Of course it hurts! Don't do it again. I will! I'll smash his head in! Then I'll beat the daylights out of you! I'm getting a bike, too. Then we can ride around in your garden, can't we? No. I'm the only person my dad lets ride in the garden. That's okay. We can ride outside. My mum doesn't let me ride outside. Then you can ride my bike. I've got my own bike. Why would I ride with you anyway? Go ride with that scummy Bekir! Buy Turkish, back the motherland. Look for the Made in Turkey brand! Very good! Tomorrow, we'll be celebrating Made-in-Turkey week. You can bring things that your family has grown. Is that clear? Yes, teacher! Go ahead, Meryem. Can we bring pastries and pies? Yes, pastries and pies are fine. Any food or drink is fine. Bring whatever you can. Okay? Okay, teacher. Good. Now, copy down what's on the board. What do you smell of? What's it to you? Temper, temper! I only asked. Have you got any money? No, my dad didn't give me any. You've never got any. Stop talking. Leave the windows open. It's safe here. What's up so early in the day, brother-in-law? Nothing that interests you. Go talk to your sister. A two-storey building would work. I'd knock down this bit. Sure. And we can put a barn here. Hey, where are the tyres? Hasan, where are the tyres? Someone's stolen them. Who'd steal them? Some up-his-ass asshole! What does that mean? I heard my dad say it. A man came over. He asked for the rent. My dad said he hadn't been paid yet. The man said he always said that. My dad swore he'd pay the rent. When the man left, my dad called him an up-his-ass asshole. Bekir, what are you doing? Are you some kind of garbage man? Don't look at me like that. Come and help. There's loads here we can sell. No. My mum gets angry when I get all dirty. Like mine doesn't! How else are we going to buy the bike? Let's go to the building site then. No, I'm going home. My dad wants me back early. I'm going home. Hey, what are you doing? Answer me! I'm collecting nails. It was you here the other day, wasn't it? Why did you steal the copper? Come here! Don't run away! Hasan, look who's coming. Didn't you say you'd sold all your cards? I just won these. Don't lie! Is that true, Oguzhan? I don't know. I just got here. Ask Ümit. Don't look at me. You were already playing when I came. I won them before you came. You said your dad wanted you home early. - He did. - Don't lie. It's true. I came back out. Bug off, liar! You're always lying. Why are you bashing my bike? I'll tell my dad. In the name of God, the Gracious, the Merciful. I made some pie. Umm... I thought... I thought the kids might want some. You, too. I don't know if I did the right thing, but... Here you are. Thanks. Mum! Mum! Hasan! Hasan! Bekir's calling you. Answer him, go on. I'm not speaking to him again. I'm changing desks as well. - Why? - He stinks. You must all learn your poem for tomorrow. Okay? Okay, teacher. Now, what have you brought for Made-in-Turkey week? Are there raisins in it, Eda? Yes, teacher. Me and my mum made it. It's very good. Now, what's this? Bulgur and walnut salad, teacher. Let me try some of that, too. Hasan, is that stuffed pepper spicy hot? No, teacher. Okay, I'll try it then. Oguzhan, didn't your mum make anything? She works in the greenhouses. They got me a cake. Okay, I'll give that a miss. Let me try one of these. Okay. Bekir, what's that? Bread, teacher. I can see that. What's in it? Soup, teacher. You used soup to make a sandwich? And some eggplant. Why did you do that? It was better than dry bread, teacher. Hold out your hands. How can you eat with those hands? How else can I eat, teacher? Tell your mother to come to school tomorrow. Okay. Is that clear? Now everyone, share what you brought with your friend. Don't make a mess, okay? I wish you all a great Made-in-Turkey week! Who made the pie? Did you buy it? No. Bekir's mum brought it last night. Really? Yes. My dad told me. She came over with it last night. What's wrong with you, idiot? Pea-brain! It's all over me! My uniform's all dirty! Teacher! Teacher! Get out! Scum! Get out of my sight! Don't come here again without your mother! Scum! I called my sister. She said what could she do. She went and spoke to the contractor. They've already made a deal. They're building a two-storey apartment block there. How can one sister do that to another? But there, she's doing it. So, what are you going to do? You can't live on the street. You'll have to go to the village. But what would I do there, for goodness sake? As a woman on my own. And there's the boy. Huh? In a village? What about the shop? They're selling that, too. They could've asked! They don't even see me as a person. That's what hurts most. Look, this is all happening because you're alone. When you're alone... people just kick you around. Again and again. Tell me about it. Osman has it rough, too, you know. No one talks to him. They've even stopped going to his shop. They don't trust a man who can't hold on to his wife. He said he wants to go back to the village, too. He must be desperate. With three kids. He wants his mother to take care of kids. Are they from the same village as us? Yes. Remember Hüseyin's daughter, Sari? She's Osman's mother. He has a field in the village, too. He wasn't interested in it before. But he'll have to be now. Now, listen. There's no knowing what fate will bring. You might suddenly find doors opening for you everywhere. Even you'd be surprised. The world's a mill. That wheel keeps turning. It's grinding flour of course. And that flour it's grinding is the likes of you and me. What can you do? Just get on with it. Three. Nine. Five. Eight. Nine. Two. Eight. Seven. - Two. - Three. Can you lend me some? One. No. You ruin the game when you lose. Oguzhan, have you seen Hasan's bike? He hasn't got one. He has now. I saw it on my way here. What bike? Hasan's. His dad got him one. Dinner's ready. Come inside. Okay. Just coming. Leave it, son. Lock the bike and come in. Bekir! Bekir! What? Was it you who beat him up? That's him. Who do you think you are? Punch his nose! His nose! Who are you to mess with him? Get him on the nose! Don't come near me again! Bekir! Bekir, come here! I'm talking to you! I've had it with you and your filth! In the name of God, the Gracious, the Merciful.
