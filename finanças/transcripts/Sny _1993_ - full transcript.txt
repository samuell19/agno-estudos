MOSFILM Studios COURIER Studios Film Committee, Russia In collaboration with SLOVO Studios a Karen SHAKHNAZAROV and Alexander BORODYANSKY production Oleg BASILASHVILI Lyudmila MORDVINOVA in D R E A M S What is worrying you, Countess? A dream, Doctor. I'm haunted by one and the same dream. That I am working in Moscow, in 1993, at a canteen number nine. A canteen? What is a canteen? It's like a cafe, only it is dirty and full of drunkards. Ah, it's a tavern then. And what are you doing there? I'm a dish-washer. A quota worker Masha Stepanova. I'm twenty, I live in a dormitory. Can you recount any details of that dream of yours? We've been robbed of 4 kilos of sugar. Semen Borisovich hid it in a strongbox. But the sugar disappeared. Who is Semen Borisovich? Semen Borisovich is our accountant. A disgusting personality. Making advances at me. There's also another repelling type, in a coat. He's drunken all the time and wants me as his mistress. They say he's a tough guy. What is 'tough'? Tough means... Well, a brigand. He is going around in a big car, with hookers. A what? Hookers - harlots who earn dollars, francs. Never rubles. - Why not taking rubles? - Who needs that wooden money! Well... Countess, you've a venus destroginus. Nervous overstrain. I would recommend a spa in the Crimea. That's to where I'm going with my husband. Well, my regards to your husband. - To the dressmaker's! - Yes, Madame. What do you think? Wonderful. This dress fits you exquisitely. Thank you, Mr. Schtockman. Could you send it to me not later than 11 in the morning? Of course. And what is this dress? This is a dress of Countess Polonskaya. What? Varya Polonskaya? Why didn't you offer me smth like this? She received this cut from Mons. Richard in Versailles. You mean she'll wear it at tomorrow's ball? I think so. Dimitry! Dimitry! What happened, Countess? Count! I positively can't appear at tomorrow's ball! But the ball is given in honour of the grand duke. Not to be there means disrespect towards the Court. But my ugly attire will be outshined by the splendour of countess Polonskaya! This is more than I can stand! What are you talking about? I saw her dress she is going to wear tomorrow. Now I see. My dear countess! You are a diamond beyond any setting! Stepan, I want my coffee to finish my report to His Majesty. Moscow Radio. 'Dialogue-Optim' company - money transfers from Russia to CIS countries. Maybe the mice ate it, Semen Borisovich? The mice? How could the mice open a safe? Why putting sugar in a safe? Everyone goes in for stealing today! Wow, 4 kilos of sugar! If no one returns the sugar by 12 o'clock, I'll file a complaint. Go on working. Stepanova, wait. Stepanova, do you fancy for a video film? Nope. Come on, let's go and have some cognac. Come on... - I'm not going anywhere. - You silly, I love you! Hey, come over here. Do you want to appear in a film? - What kind of film? - About the coup. Our sponsors is a British company. A political thriller. - What role will I play? - The leading one. Our heroine, a university student, a White House defendant. She has a mission from President to reconnoiter and to find out the time of White House besiege. General Rastorguev, a sworn Communist, can give her the X-hour if she has sex with him. But she is a virgin: her wooer - a student-democrat from philology faculty. For the sake of democracy she agrees to have sex with that coup fiend. Okay? - Okay. - Let's go to the movie set! Eltsin! Eltsin! Comrades, any volunteers for a risky mission? - Any volunteers? - Me! What a wonderful young generation, Oleg! - Which one shall we pick out? - That girl. - I think she'll do. - What is your name? My name is Masha Stepanova. President sends you as a scout to Division 48. You must find out when they are planning to attack The White House. Come back not later than tomorrow morning. Remember: the fate of democracy is in your hands! Wait! Who is that? I must see the Commander. Hawk to Falcon. A pretty girl wants to see the Commander. Let her through. You want to know when we gonna attack The White House? Yes, General. Semen Borisovich? I'm not Semen Borisovich. But you are an accountant from our canteen! I'm anything but an accountant! I'm General Rastorguev, Commander of Assault Division 48. - Shall I serve the tea? - No! Gee, you look so sweet in that mini-skirt of yours! Okay, I'll disclose X-hour to you only if you have sex with me. Not in your life! Not even for the sake of democracy? - You will be mine! - Never! - I've got you! - Let go! I'll show you what is what! Let go, you darned communist! What's wrong? A bad dream? Yes: Semen Borisovich tried to seduce me! - What Semen Borisovich? - Accountant from our canteen. Accountant? Canteen? What are you talking about? About my dream, Count. I was on my way to The White House to tell President there'd be no storming. - But Semen Borisovich... - Did you see the doctor? He prescribed me a spa in the Crimea. Fine. And, I own it, the sooner - the better. After I appear with my report before the State Council, we'll go to the Crimea. A dress from Mister Schtockman. Aha, that very dress. Pray, show it to me. But it's wonderful! Because you didn't see Polonskaya's dress! Parasha, I want my coffee to finish my report to His Majesty. Parasha! Give me that dress. You know what, Parasha... Give me scissors. - Scissors? - Yes. Count and Countess Polonsky! Polonskaya is charming today. She will be a favourite of this ball. Let us wait for Countess Prizorova to rival her. Count and Countess Prizorov! You produced quite a sensation. Look at Polonskaya. She is going to swoon. May I pay my humble respects to you, Your Majesty! Yes, it's a real scandal. A scandal it is, Doctor. Imagine: the grand duke and his wife and the Court: and my wife wearing that skirt! What went into her head? She's wearing skirts like this in her dreams. - Those bizarre dreams. - Exceedingly bizarre. Imagine: last night she saw me in her dream. - You know what I was doing? - What? Peddling porno shots in Arbat street. Yes, Doctor. A model being my wife, in most indecent stances. I push off that dirty material in Arbat street, 500 rubles per one photo. Why on earth you doing this, Your Excellency? To make both ends meet: I'm a pensioner. The prices are unbelievable! Bread is 43 rubles! - Per one pound? - Per one loaf! Ostankino sausage, not quite fresh, 1750 rubles per kilo. Eggs - 352 rubles per dozen. Oh, I'm sorry. I seem not to be well myself. This situation is telling on my nerves. Yes, how bizarre. Indeed. Very well, I will give you a medicine. It's the newest development, sent by Professor Zolenberg from Berlin. He is a very nice person! It will relieve the countess from her nightmares. Two tea-spoonfuls before going to bed. - Thank you, Doctor. - Be in touch. Your hip! The curve! Smile! Smile! Make it more sexy. Even more sexy! And more sexy. What's wrong? I can't. You want me to die from starvation? No, but I can't pose nude any more. Blimey! Hey, your every photo fetches 500 rubles. We pull through thanks to you. And damn those reformers. You drink gorgeous Scotch and expensive cigars! You don't want me to drink that hogwash that you bought? You said the photos were for California fashion magazine, but instead you selling them at Arbat. I've sent them to California. Waiting for a reply. That must be the landlords. I'm not home. - Can I help you? - It's about an ad. - What ad? - In 'Moskovsky komsomolets'. 'A bisexual guy would meet a well-off sponsor for a partner, 'or a girl with whimsical inclinations. 'Reward wanted in currency.' - It's a mistake. - But it's your address. Some blah-blah-sexual placed an ad with our address! - So, it's a mistake then. - No, come on in. You're welcome. - A minus or a plus? - A plus. I'm a minus. Do you have hard currency on you? No, I pay in rubles, at the exchange rate. It's written there in plain Russian: 'Hard currency.' I pay 1200. No, Sir, no wooden money. Get lost! What a cheek! - What a swindler! - Count, are you nuts? Mashenka, privation drove me to this. Our government giving pensioners to the dogs! Make some dinner, I must go to work. Money, Deutch marks, dollars. Porno! - How much? - Five hundred. - For this? - Take it or leave it. Okay, I'll take this for one dollar. May I have a look. - What a pretty girl! How much? - Five hundred. Very charming. She'd look nice as one of our government. - Who are you, guys? - We are MPs. Promenading here. Looking for a new Minister of the Economy. - A young woman with looks. - She's what you need. Yeah. A very nice girl. - Could we speak to her? - We live around the corner. - Our limousine is a step away. - Let's go. I won't make it. I'm a simple dishwasher. We are not academicians, but we handle our jobs. - Some wine? - Why not. But why me? A task of the Minister of the Economy - to get credits from the West. Something only a pretty girl with looks can do. - You know what bankers are like. - Oh, yes. Cheers! Care for another glassful? No, we must go. We've a date with President. Please meet our new Minister of the Economy. Any objections or questions? No, let her work. - The Supreme Council... - They'll approve. The Supreme Council should be kicked out! Hush, Eduard. - Any questions to Stepanova? - No. Let her work. Congratulations, Comrade Stepanova! What else do we have on the agenda? The Ukrainians making the fur fly. What do they want? They grudge us their sugar. - Why? - Just because. Smart ones! What do we do, comrades? We should send a wire that they send us sugar. Right. We'll send them a wire. Right! What else? Tomorrow Baron Dominique arrives, a spokesperson from IMF, That's very important. What can we do to wring big money from them? That baron is such a fox! I was negotiating with him in Paris. It'll be a job to make him cough it up. For this we have our new Minister of the Economy. Comrade Stepanova, you must do your best to make them give as much money as possible. - Is that all? - There's a wire from Kazan. To the effect?.. They want to play football with us. MP team versus MP team. That's a pretty cake! - On whose turf? - They didn't say. What shall we do? They'll beat us. Tatars are big lugs. What shall we do? Let guys from the Supreme Soviet play with them. Right, Eduard: let guys from the Supreme Soviet carry the can. May I introduce myself. Chief of security, Major Panteleeva. Stepanova. My husband, Count Prizorov. Please. Nice bread. Bread-and-salt. Your dining room. Your sitting room. Your hotline. The study and bedroom are upstairs. Do you have a river here? A swimming pool. If you need me... Push this red button here. What a handsome place. The government did everything you could fruitfully work. Things mundane is not what I care for. I must live up to President's expectations, I must save our country from this big crisis. - Absolutely. - May I? You must be our new Minister of the Economy Miss Stepanova? Right. We live next door. Deputy Defense Minister General Klochkov. His dacha is on the left side from yours. Minister of agriculture. Ivan Kurochkin. His dacha is on the right side. Minister of Culture. Bruskov-Bukeev. My dacha is behind yours. Glad to meet you. My husband, Count Prizorov. - How do you do. - How do you do. We were just passing by and decided to look in on you. Right. Come on in. - Care for a drink, comrades? - Gin and tonic. - Some Scotch. - Vodka. - What about you, Count? - I would have some cognac. A glassful of dry wine. Let us drink to renovation of our Russia! Yes! Help yourselves. In pre-revolution times Russia was the second largest country in pig farming. Now pig farming is in doldrums... ...because we have nothing to feed pigs with. Come credits from the West, we could buy grain, we could feed pigs thus increasing pig head status. And our people will be filled. Provided people are filled, they can work well. Those who work well - live well. Those who live well feel happy. Instead of drinking vodka - they'd go to museums, theatres. They grow civilized. Which means higher standards of culture. If there are higher standards of culture, we have less hooligans loafing about the streets. Now we run short of civilized people. Hence - vodka-drinking. And even making moonshine. And even brawling in the street. And stealing what comes their way. All this is due to the lack of culture. But if we get credits from the West, we can boost our culture. We can boost the number of civilized people. So, at any rate, we need their credits badly. We can only hope on Stepanova here. We're broadcasting from Vnukovo airport. Any minute now a plane will arrive with IMF spokesperson Baron Dominique on board. He will negotiate with Minister of the Economy Stepanova. What do you expect from the pending negotiations? We expect to get the highest credits at the lowest interest. Well, good luck to you. Aha, I will get ye! Baron, we would like to know what credits do you have in mind? Zero. No credits until you pay old ones. We can't pay old credits with no new ones coming. I don't care how you pay them. We'll never have enough for you. And we have no money either. That's a pretty thing: everyone is moneyless. But where is the money? Where did it go? I don't know. Very well. Another drop of that dew? Enough. Very well. We need to make a call. What do we do? They've no money. And you believed! They are wallowing in money. - What do we do then? - You must flirt with him. - He is so impressive. - He won't look at me. 'cause you sit like a dummy! Give him a wink, flash a knee, slide open a button.. - And he'll swallow the bait. - And if not? Then we'll defame him for sexual abuse. What? I'll bring musicians and you'll invite him for a dance. When he gets horny invite him to your room. When he steps in - take off your clothes and scream: 'He's raping me!' - and I'll come with a camera. And he'll have to choose between those photos and credits. What a base thing to do! But we're doing this for the sake of our country. Come on. Did you make your call? Yes. Where is the count? He... He went home: his mom fell ill. Now we are alone. Shall we dance? I go crazy from Russian women. What about going upstairs. Here is the key. I'll buy some wine and join you. Semen Borisovich? There you are! Let go! You bitch! Wait! I'll get you! You dirty hooker! Wait, you viper! I'll get you! Now you won't get away. I'll show you what is what! Stop jerking! You could at least offer me some bubbles. At last you talking sense. Instead of playing hard-to-get... Let's go and toss of a drink. Won't I give it you hot and strong, Stepanova! Just you wait, you cheap hooker! - You're asking for it! - Help! Help! He's raping me! Now we have him on the hook. Damn! Who is he? Semen Borisovich, our accountant... ...What happened then? According to the countess, it was a big scandal. Our mass media, as usual, made that bomb go up and the countess was made to resign. Doctor, relieve me from this hell! Calm down, my dear. Calm down. Count, may I talk with you in private. Excuse us, Countess. Doctor, truly, it's very disquieting - those nightmares my wife has. Of course. Pray, Count, tell me: haven't you noticed anything strange about your wife? What do you mean? That accountant in her dreams - with a mania to snare her body... Oh no. Believe me, the countess is far from being an abnormal woman. But those photos, those indecent stances... Have you ever gone in for photography? What are you driving at? I mean this little mischievous habit of keeping magazines with frivolous pictures - have you ever had a fancy for ones? God forbid, I've never had such magazines! Why are you asking? Because dreams are not our incoherent fantasy. Dreams only reflect the surrounding reality. And there is one thing... which worries me. In life I don't see any motivation of what the countess sees in her dreams... I don't quite understand you, Doctor. The fact she sees you in her dreams selling in the street most unhandsome photos... Maybe she has some grounds for this?... - That is too much, Doctor! - But scientists say... Please spare me this talk of yours! Well... The more I get convinced it's a most unusual case. And I have an opinion of my own here. But I would like Monsieur Renoir to step in. Who is Monsieur Renoir? He is an outstanding interpreter of dreams and visions, an honorary member of many an academy. Let us not linger then. Monsieur Renoir is expecting us. Shall we start? Take off your hat. Don't be afraid. Try to do what I will tell you. Now you will sleep. Close your eyes... Close your eyes... You are sleeping. Now you are going to sleep. You're seeing dreams... What do you see? Take your hands off my bum, you dirty fuzz! Very good! What did she say? Hush. What else can you see? You gimme the kicks, Lyokha! Lekha, without you I feel blue! My heart goes clink, and it's true! What is that? Monsters of rock love peace!! What? I'm a sexy girl Masha Stepanova! Who wants me, boys? Most amazing! He's an accountant, oh, boy! Gimme a piece of joy! What is she dreaming about? Our bash going on! Dima Prizorov is one of us! Who?... Dima Prizorov! People, I'm here! Do like me! Who wants me, girls? You're my Hannibal-girl, you will come to my house, I will do it three times, I will tear your mouth. In what you left in my bed I will drown. Baby, I wanna go downtown. But there's a trap at the door, I can leave nevermore. But one day you will step baby, in your own trap. Now you give me no chance and a cancan you dance. And your leash is the band from my pants. You freaked out, you hid out of whack... - But you'll come back... - Stop! Wake up! Wake up! - Darling! - Calm down. Calm down. What a distress. I want your attention, gentlemen. Gentlemen, I'm quite positive that what we have is a very singular case. The countess, in her dreams, lives in the year 1993. - 100 years hereafter. - Clairvoyance? In some way yes. Though, some people can be aware of their clairvoyance. Back in the 16th century Nostradamus predicted Napoleon. But some people possess this gift only in their sleep. And their dreams reflect not contemporaneous reality, but reality which is due in 100 or 200 years. Scientists know such cases. Say, the Righteous... - Excuse me, Monsieur... - Renoir. Monsieur Renoir, this is all horse's feathers. There can't be such reality even in 1000 years. But, alas... 'Dirty fuzz'... 'You gimme the kicks'... You call this reality? Count, one hundred years is a big span of time. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Thank you. Darling, what kind of country is that? What? What is that country you see in your dreams? - CIS. - What is that? I don't know. Neither do they. But do they have a government? They have umpteen governments. But there should be a government to run the country. - Do they have a tsar? - They do without one. - Where did the tsar go? - I don't know. They have had no tsar since the Revolution. So, it's Democratic Republic then, like in France? I don't know. They don't know either. But any state should have a structure. - Do they have any order? - None. How can such a power exist without order? But it exists. Your Excellency, he's come. Show him in. Sorry for summoning you at such a late hour. But this is an urgent matter. I'm at your service. Monsieur Renoir... Is it possible for me to see the dreams of my wife? That would be quite a problem. Monsieur Renoir, it's very important. Well... I shall try. - Is she asleep? - Yes, she's in her chamber. Let's go. Sit at her bed-side. Look at her face. Now close your eyes. Concentrate. Now you will see her dream. What do you feel? A light. A bright blinding light... Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to our "Miss Bust of CIS" pageant! This is your hour, oh tits and boobs! Please meet our jury. The chairman - member of Ethics Committee, Doctor of Arts Eduard Potemkin. The jurors: a popular businessman Igor Beck. An American businessman and democrat John Smith. Chairman of 'Peace for Children' Association, a satirist Efim Alperevich. Director General of oil company 'Tymenneftegazstroi' Rafil Gizatulin. Our General Sponsor - Mister Myshkin. And I'm pleased to announce a jazz-orchestra of the Bundeswehr's Division 7 conducted by Hermann Mayer. And the hype CIS rock-band - Rusty Nails! But before our first contestant appears before the jury, I would like to announce the preacher of evangelical church from Minnesota - Father Braun. Dear sisters and brethren! I used to be a nasty child. I smoked, I drank gin and tonic, I stole things and masturbated. I was a big disappointment to my parents. Once, after having yet another bottle of gin, I was watching the TV. Suddenly the anchor addressed me: 'Stop it, Bob! 'Stop it before it's too late!' And I saw it was not an anchor but God Himself telling me what my regressions were fraught with. Sisters and brethren, Hallelujah to our Lord and to his son Jesus! I'm glad to announce that to every contestant Father Braun presents a Bible and a bottle of California wine! Sisters and Brethren! Enough, enough! Ladies and gentlemen! Let us begin. I invite contestant number one... Maria Stepanova, Russia! - Hi. - Hi. Are you a student or you have a job? I work at a canteen and I'm an external student at an institute. Dear Masha, your bust represents Russia. - You feel the responsibility? - Of course. I wish to win in this pageant. And, while other girls can't hear us... - You afraid others can score? - No. But I think the world of the busts from Moldova and Tajikistan. Me too. All monies raised from this contest will go to building Christ Our Savior Cathedral. Anyone who pays the biggest premium will be entitled to imprint a kiss on the contestant's bust. Who wants to kiss Ìaria Stepanova? - 1 thousand rubles is bid! - 1 thousand 500! - Any advance on 1500? - 2 thousand! 2 thousand! 2 thousand - one! - 2 thousand 900! - 2 thousand 900... - 2 thousand 900 - one! - 15 thousand! 15 thousand - one! 15 thousand - two! 15 thousand - three! Cheers to the winner! Gentleman who mentioned 15 thou, please join us. Give him a round of applause! A mysterious Mister X. Will you tell us your name? Semen Borisovich! Yes, it's me! What zeal! Enough, young man. Countess, wake up! Oh, Count! Oh my God. And again I had a nightmare. Calm down, darling. What did you see? I saw in my dream I was at a pageant... a pageant... Of tits and boobs? My God, it was horrible! Is this the future? I'm sorry. And there is no deliverance? I don't know. Your Majesty! Esteemed gentlemen! The future of Russia is dark and gloomy. Suppose there is a person who sees the future 100 years away from him? What is it that he'll see? Total degradation, collapse of the great empire, impoverishment of people scouting like wild beasts for crumbs of bread... total idiocy... What is he speaking about? For hapless Russian women the most prestigious situation would be to become a prostitute. Yes, gentlemen. A prostitute who will offer her body not for rubles but for marks or dollars. But why not for rubles? Who needs that wooden money? Ruble will become cheap as paper. - What? - Excuse me: why such grim visions stirring your imagination? Because, Your Majesty, if we don't make reforms in our society... If we don't do this reasonably, under the supervision of our tsar, then all latent schisms will lead to upheaval, a revolution. Which will mean chaos and confusion. And what, in your mind, reforms should be made? Lnd should belong to peasants, factories and plants should be run by workers. He is a socialist! Lower classes should be entitled to take part in running the state. I'm a patriot of Russia! Count, you produced quite a scandal! Your resignation is in all papers. They are blind! They will ruin Russia! What are you going to do? I don't know. Count! My dear Count. Let's go to the countryside. Imagine: the woods... the fields... a river... It's long time since we tarried in our estate. Maybe there I will stop seeing bad dreams! Sweet home. Count! Blizzard! My doggie... Stepanova... Are you sleeping? Stepanova. Go and pick the dishes, we are closing up. Stepanova. I bought me a dacha. Congratulations. A good one? Yes. It's an old house, but I will overhaul it. It will be a palace of a dacha. You wanna go and have a look? - You'll start pawing me again? - No, I swear. Okay. Here is my dacha. - Who lived here before? - It was a TB sanatorium. I will trim it with planks. I will change the roofing. Slavka promised to bring 50 sheets of Gl. Here I will build a fireplace. That parasite Slavka, so negligent...
