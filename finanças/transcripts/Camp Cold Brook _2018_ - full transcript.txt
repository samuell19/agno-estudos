Between the journey of the living and the realm of the dead. Try that. Our team of paranormal experts reveal the most heinous crimes. He took the girls here, he tortured 'em. Put their bodies in here. 29 inmates died down here. Ronald Brown was found hanging in an elevator shaft by one of his... Did you? And uncover the most shocking legends. Tim and Emily Davis. They claim to have coincidentally purchased a home that her twin sister, who was kidnapped at age nine, had been held captive in the basement. Oh, come on. I know, I know. Let's look at this shit, thing's going crazy. We take the incredible and make it credible. We make the illogical logical. And we bring the dead back to life. I'm Jack Wilson. Join us. Hi, I have a 1:30 with John Brierwitz. I know who you are. You can head on in. Thank you. My husband loves your show. Your husband has excellent taste. Look, Jack, it's been a great run. Three seasons in TV is saying something nowadays. But everything's going scripted. More money, syndication, plus you'll get a bigger bump in streaming. Reality TV just doesn't have the legs right now. John, it's not reality TV. You know that. I know, I know, you've elevated it. But the ratings are not elevated, that's the problem. We're only three episodes into the season. You wanna cancel us before our biggest episode airs? No, no, no, no, no. We'll run whatever you shot. Maybe a shakeup in the lineup. I just wanted to give you the heads up. There's not gonna be a pickup for another season. You can't move us, John. We're on the cusp of something really big, we're about to shoot it now. What is it? No. Uh-uh, I'm keeping a lid on it. But when it delivers, it will, I want another eight episode guarantee. Jack, I literally told you 10 seconds ago that wasn't going to happen. Fine. I'll walk it over to Travel Channel. You can walk it over to the Food Network if you want to. Look, I'm doing this because I like you, because I can appreciate and respect what you try to do for the show, but it's over. Okay, I'll shop. John. This is the one. This is the one that separates all those hack shows from us. No bullshit EVP machines, but actual documented proof of life after death. And it's gonna happen on someone else's goddamn network. All right, Jack. Come on. All right, here's what we're gonna do. If this show is what you say it is, finish your run of existing episodes, we'll run this as a 90 minute special in summer. If, and I'm talking a big if here, the numbers come back big, we can discuss a fourth season. It will. One episode? Your amazing news is one new episode. No. It's the episode. We produce one ball-busting, scare the living shit out of our audience episode and we got another season. I think I'll start scaring up my unemployment paperwork. Coffee anyone? Oh. No. Got a lot to do and no time to do it. So, where we going? I say we do Winchester House. No way. Place is lame. Besides, I heard they're shooting some shit paranormal movie about it. Yeah, Helen Mirren's actually set to star. Really? Do you know if they have a DP yet? Oh, I'm just shocked that they haven't called you yet. I mean, clearly they must have missed that episode we shot in Alcatraz where you fell asleep in the cellar. Hey, hey, stop, stop, stop! Come on, guys. What the hell is wrong with you? This is it. We are all out on our asses if we don't come up with something big here, so let's put our heads together, come on. I say we do Winchester House and then we tie the movie into it. That's a great idea. We don't have time for something like that. Um, I have one. What do you have? It's a camp, it's called Cold Brook. It's in Oklahoma? Yeah, I gotcha, but there's not much here. Nothing cool at least. What'd you hear about it? Someone posted it to one of our fan sites. We have fan sites? It happened in 1990. Not one news crew was allowed in after. The camp was owned by a local church in the area. Afterwards, they shut it down and they wouldn't let anyone near the property. Huh, surprised you never heard it. Who reads newspapers anymore? How big is Cold Brook? Um. Population 1,000. Well, hicksville in the sticksville. You're not actually thinking about this right now, right? You think this is our one episode to rule them all? Nobody's even heard of this place except for our one fan apparently. Well, maybe that's the point. Maybe what we need is a place that no one's ever heard of. That 50 other ghost hunting teams haven't shot every square inch of. What do you think, Ang? Well, summer camp is kinda big right now. Dead kids, always creepy. Okay. We set up a location scout. Four of us, this weekend. If it looks promising, we'll book the crew to come on next week. Yeah, I actually have Rams tickets this weekend, so. So you don't come, you can fill out your unemployment paperwork at the game. It's your choice. Set up to travel. Okay. Daddy! Hey, girls. How was your day? What did you guys do today? - We made brownies. - Yeah. Good, I want some. Uh, after dinner. Oh, there's Mom. - You're so funny. - Go get some. How was your day? Good. Oh, girls! Haley, Monet! I'm gonna pay for that one. Sorry about the brownies, Daddy. What are you talking about? Those were the best kitchen floor brownie that I have ever tasted. Do you think ghosts are real? Do I think ghosts are real? Hmm. Well, if they are, nothing to be afraid of. So I shouldn't be afraid of the one in my dreams? No. Those are just dreams. I already told her that. Well, thank you, Monet. Thank you. All right. She looks real. She likes your show. Well, tell her to write my producers. Could use the ratings. Good night, girls. Night, Daddy. Haley's still having nightmares? I guess so. She's just at that age. Monet was the same way, remember? Now she's onto imaginary friends. Though not everyone outgrows it, do they? We're in trouble, aren't we? No. The show will be fine. Do you want to try that again, Jack? We could be doing better. But I got a good feeling about this episode. If it works out, another season. We'll be flying by fine before you know it. And if not? We'll sell Monet. What? What, you can't sell the other one, she's damaged goods. Seeing dead people and all that shit. Connie. Everything's going to be just fine. I promise. You gotta trust me. Hey folks, Rockin' Ricky here, rocking your Saturday afternoon with today's hits and yesterday's favorites. It's 77 degrees outside my studio door and we'll have clear skies all weekend. So sit back, relax, and let Rockin' Ricky find your groove. So the official police report is mass homicide with one suicide. Apparently, this woman, she went into the camp one night and she poisoned and drowned everybody. And before she could be arrested, she burned - herself alive. - Jesus. So who owns the land that the camp's on now? I don't think anybody owns it. I did some digging around online and looks like the church group abandoned it in like 1991, so it's just been sitting there. All right. It's a great backstory, huh? Land so haunted no one would dare to buy it. That her? Yeah. Look at that. Hey, Kevin, what do you think, huh? Swipe right? Jack! You see her? Angie? No, I don't, she's gone. What the hell was she doing in the middle of the road? Nothing like a quiet week in the country. Yeah. Hey guys, go and grab a table. I'm gonna see if I can catch this guy. Hello? Sheriff Gordon? Yeah. We spoke yesterday. Jack Wilson. You look taller on TV. Low angles, that's the key. Well, it's like I told you over the phone. I'd hate like hell to have you and all your guys come up here for nothing. It's not a good idea is what it is. I mean, they don't want anybody up there. Who's they? Is there like new owners? We didn't see anyone listed. I mean, they, we, us, everybody, the whole town. Now I know what you're here for, Hollywood. But everybody around here seems to think it's best just left in the past. Besides, I ain't got the damn resources to pull your ass outta there once you get lost. Well, maybe I could help you out with that bit. I would love to make a donation to this year's Deputy Ball if I could. I suppose I could do that. All right. I appreciate that. I'll see you at first light. Thank you, sir. Hello? Hi. You mind if I ask you some questions? You're that guy from "Haunt Squad", right? You got me. Jack Wilson. Don't go in there. The camp? That place is marked. Huh. What do you mean by marked? My sister was killed in there. Wow, she was one of the campers? My parents were members of the church. Bernadeau blamed them for her daughter dying. She blamed your parents? No, the church. Everyone, all of them. They tried for years to kick her out of that old house near the camp because they thought she was a witch. Her daughter died, she changed. She started in on that bad magic, they said. 30 to bring back the one. 30 deaths, the curse is won. 30 to bring back the one. 30 deaths, the curse is won. 30 to bring back the one. Then she did what she did. 30 deaths, the curse is won. 30 to bring back the one. All right, here we go. Well, thank you fellas for driving us up to what I'm sure will be certain death. Listen, man. You got no cell phone service up here. Your radios won't reach all the way into town. So once we're gone, you're on your own. We'll be fine. Thank you for your help, Sheriff. Be back up here about the same time Monday morning. I want you folks just to, just don't get lost. Come on, Nate, let's get out of here. Just hope you don't get lost. All right, see where we should set up. I got top bunk. Oh. All right, I hate to admit it, but I think we've got ourselves a gem. I can feel it! Yeah, see if you say that after a bear comes in here and eats us while we sleep. All right, folks, let's do this. Got a lot to do, let's get 'er done. Make this home base. Yeah. Right? Right? Right! Oh shit. I got bulbs! I got plenty of bulbs! Okay, kids, gather round. Just got these puppies in this week. These cameras run off of a small three axis gimbal. So we walk, we run, we do whatever, the gimbal adjusts to the movement and the camera keeps perfectly still. No more shitty shaky cam stuff. With a flick of the wrist, the camera flips around into selfie mode. Angela, I'm sure you use that a lot. How's that look? Yeah, that's looking good. Cameras are picking up everything really well. Copy that. Here we go. No, no, no, what was that guy, that PA? Michael? - Micah. - It was Micah! Micah, yes, Micah. Right, so we're, well, we're unloading at the Mansfield Reformatory. It's cold as shit outside and you could tell that this guy is like, he's fucking scared out of his mind already. So we go inside down to like where the cell block area is and this gush of wind like comes up. Oh, I remember this shit. Right, right? So this gust of wind comes up and I swear, I don't know how this building was built but it makes this like howling noise down there and I look over at Micah and his hands start to tremble. So he steadies himself and he puts down the box of Cheez-Its and he walks out. - No. - Oh yeah. Yeah, dude got in the crew van, never saw him again. And we never saw the crew van again. Well, no one's ever accused me of being sentimental but it's been a good gig. I haven't seen one goddamn ghost, but hey, it's been a hell of a ride, so thank you, boss. Cheers. Thank you guys. Oh, all right, well, with that, I'm off. Angela, this may be our last chance. Just saying, but bunk bed's sturdy enough for two. Oh, just enough room for you and your ego. Oh, come on, I'm just saying. I thought we had a moment there. No. Oh man, okay. Oh, that's gonna pan out nicely. Quiet out here, isn't it? Uh huh. Hopefully a little too quiet. Listen, I wanted to thank you for doing this. For believing in this. Do you know why I hired you, Emma? No. Because you believe. You wanna see something, to know that there is something out there. Just like I used to. You don't anymore? No. I mean, I'll turn it on when the cameras are on, I'll give a show, but, there's something out there, I would've seen it by now. Then what are we doing here? I told you. Because you believe. Maybe I was never the one they wanted to talk to. Okay. Jack Wilson here, Haunt Squad. We are deep in the woods of Oklahoma, Camp Cold Brook. Everyone's still fast asleep right now and of course I wake up and notice that the fire we had going in the fire pit just lit up again. Completely doused it a few hours ago but as you can clearly see, the fire. Just went out. So I'm gonna go check it out. Now we clearly just saw the fire go out just a few seconds ago, yet the embers are stone cold. No smoke. Now I know you heard that. Okay, that's odd. There's a strong smell emanating from the kitchen but this kitchen hasn't been in use for over 20 years. Yet clear as day, I can smell something. Hello? Hello? Man. Oh, this is interesting. Some type of symbol sketched on the wall here, I'm not sure of the origin, maybe Native American. We haven't seen any Native American symbols anywhere else in the camp. Seems a little out of place. But I'd say when 28 souls are tragically lost in one place, you really can't overlook anything. May be valid, maybe not, I don't know. But just another tragic mystery here at Camp Cold Brook. Jack's gonna turn in for the night. Really becoming fond of you, new girl. We're usually down in the sardines and pretzel portion of the scout by day two, but you? Coming out big with the Bisquick. You can definitely hear something in the room. Now I know you heard that. Now I know you heard that. I've seen this symbol before. I'm gonna do some digging around. Well, keep your eyes open if you see any more. Could be nothing but you never know. Okay. I'll set up the center of the camp and this cabin down below. You guys have your assignment. Kevin, make sure you throw up a 5D on the bridge overlooking the creek. Can I finish my pancakes first? Time to make the donuts, big boy. That's some cold-hearted shit right there, man. Cold-hearted. I'm up on this fucking bridge like Temple of Doom. Haven't got a shot for shit. Jack to Kevin? Yep, Kevin. Where you at? Bridge. Well, hurry up and get that knocked out. Got a cabin here that's not on the map. Want to get a camera on it right away. Jack, come in, Jack. Go for it, Jack. I can't reach Kevin. I just talked to him. Well, his radio doesn't have signal. Okay. I'll hunt him down. What? The hell are you doing? Jack. Kevin? Oh shit. Emma. - Ang? - Shit. Jack? I'm seeing shit, I'm hearing shit. I saw something on the monitor. Whoa, you okay? I don't know. Oh god. All right, sit down. Tell me everything. Oh god. Hey, what's up? Were you just outside? I knocked. I was just in the storage room next door. That was you? Forget it, forget it, forget it. Tell me what you saw. I thought I saw this thing and it appeared in the dining hall monitor and then it went outside and it looked like it was looking at me. Keep going. And then the porch light blew out and then I went into the hallway. And I tried to get you guys on the damn radio and neither one of you answered! Can you blow it up on playback? What happened? We may have something. What? It doesn't look like it was recording. Why aren't these recording? They should be. I have them patched for motion and sound. Motion? Ghost motion? Come on, man. This is a scout, Jack. I don't have near the gear or the hard drive space to have them running all the time. And besides, I just got thrown off that bridge trying to get your precious creek shot. Goddamn it. Oh, fuck off, man, seriously. You know there's a lot of pressure here for this episode to deliver but spoiler alert, we're never gonna find anything. We never have. Fuck. Go ahead, start recording. I'm gonna head down to the dining hall and check it out. I'm coming with. Yeah, I'm fine by the way, thank you. Fucking ass. One shot! Kevin, come in? Batteries are good and working. Repeat, good and working. Kevin, did you ever find any gas for this jenny? Kevin, come in? Kevin! Asshole. These cameras just went out. The cameras are still on. There's something in front of the lens. Jack? Jack? Hey, Jack? Start rolling on all these cameras now. Wait, wait, wait, where are you going? I'm gonna go check it out. Well, hold on. Just, I mean, just hang out a minute. Do you not want me going because you're worried about me or do you not wanna be alone? That's what I thought. Jack? Jack? Hey, Emma? Kevin? I'm butt ass fucking naked in here right now. Fuck this shit, I'm outta here. Hey guys, I'm coming out. I need to know your location. Little shits. Think it's cool to mess with the ghost guy, huh? Well, ha ha ha. Goddamn it, hey! Hey, what are you doing in there, huh? Little shit. Jack? Kevin, I swear to god if this is you! Holy shit. Get the fucking thing on. Shit. Ang? Ang, hey. They attacked me. - What? - I don't know. We're getting outta here. Is she okay? What's going on? I have no idea. Angie, come on, what happened? Where the fuck have you been? What, you don't answer your radio? Fell asleep. You fell asleep. We're having real fucking events here and you're off dicking around? What's this? Found it in a cabin at the edge of camp. Jack. Okay, what the hell's wrong with you? I don't know, what's wrong with me? What is wrong with me? What is wrong with me? Let's see, the only thing that's wrong with me is that I'm stuck out here with a bunch of hacks. I went to USC for this shit. I should be on some sound stage, shooting a fucking "Howling" reboot or "The Virtue", whatever goddamn reboot of the week they're doing. But instead, I'm out here in bumfuck, Oklahoma with you clowns, chasing nothing for the millionth time. You done? I'll go check on the cameras. Don't wait up for me, pretty boy. Just let him go, let him go. He'll sleep it off. Fuck. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I saw this in the kitchen. They're all over the place. There's something like this in one of the cabins too. We gotta find out what these symbols mean. We can go check... No! No, she's right, she's right. We hunker down here tonight, I'll get you out in the morning. You're all fucking crazy. I say we burn the goddamn place down and we walk out together. Hi. How are you? Oh, you know, I'm good. Painted the hallway earlier. Could use you out here. Hey, is he there? I can't reach him on his phone. Oh, no. Actually there's an outside chance that he may be by to see you. He's in Oklahoma for the week. For the show? Yeah. Where? Somewhere in the middle of nowhere. But I know he's gonna be by to say hello. Where? Something Creek or Stream? Cold Brook. That's it. Esther? We're sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed. Please check the number and dial... I'm surprised she's asleep. I slipped her an Ambien. What are you working on? 28 bodies were found in the river. Two campers were never found. So? Take a look at this. Some type of invocation. I'll bet it's tied into the murders. This ceremony, look, the rite of fire by water. 30 offerings of human life not yet reached their second decade. 30 marked are the 30 offered. So what do the symbols have to do with it? I don't know. Which cabin did you find it in? What do you wanna bet here, here, and here, huh? And the dining hall. It's the center. Right where she poisoned them. Harnessed to the distance of the smoke, the ring of fire. The body of water. 30 children will bring back the one. She was trying to bring back her daughter. But she needed 30. She only had 28 bodies. She couldn't finish the ritual. It trapped them here. Inside. The ring of fire. Jesus, Jack. So what if we do the opposite? What? The ring of fire amplifies her power, right? So what if we cover the symbols? Maybe that breaks the spell. It's worth a shot. What time is it? Uh, oh my goodness, after one. What? How's that even possible? Okay, I need my, I need. Okay, I gotta get her outta here. Emma. Keep this walkie on you. I'll be back as soon as I get her out. You ready? Yeah. Find those symbols. Hi there. Can I help you? I'm here to see Deputy Gordon? Sheriff Gordon? Yeah, he's not in till after four today, is there something I can help you with? Can you get ahold of him? I can take a message. Tell him Esther Wilson's looking for him. You wanna leave a number? Okay. Whatever that is back there is real, Jack. I know, I believe you. No, you don't. If you did, you would have made them come with us. Look, Ang. We can't just leave. All right, I got too much riding on this. We all do. What happened to me was on tape, you would not say that. And if I had it on tape, we wouldn't need to stay. You need to listen to me, okay? It's not worth it. The show is not worth it. You got a signal? You have service? Why is nothing on there? Why is nothing on there? It's a bad signal. We're headed the right way. Hey, if you get service again, you call the sheriff. I mean it. Kevin? Kevin. Hey. This place is fucked, man. Are you okay? Does this look like the face of someone who's in full control of their faculties to you? Someone out here's fucking with us. Someone or something? You've already got the job, doll, just don't. No, no. One of these bumpkins got a whole bunch of his bumpkin friends that've been fucking with us. This is probably already up on YouTube. No, Kevin. This is real. This is really happening. Look at this. We found symbols in these cabins here. It has something to do with keeping their spirits bound here. Do you know if this cabin has a symbol? What's this now? Jack thinks if we cover the symbols, it'll somehow diminish their power. Of course he does. Fuck my life, man. We have two more symbols to find. I have to find the one in the fort area and down by the creek, the shack. Oh no, let me go. Kevin's got it. Why wouldn't he, Kevin's got everything. Carry all the shit. Spooky symbols. Come on out, Esther. Now what are you doing all the way back up in here? Don't be ridiculous. You know very well what I'm doing here. My son is in there and you are gonna help me get him out. Your son? Yes, him and his friends and that show. You mean Hollywood ghost boy's little Johnny? Why would he even think about coming back? Because he doesn't remember. How could you let them go in there? If she hurts him in any way. She's dead, Esther. This is all just hysteria and superstition, - that's all it is. - You know what happened. You know what we did. We're not even close. Let's just get up this ridge, maybe we'll see something. We're lost, Jack. I can get us back. Oh my god. What? Fuck. Fuck, I was right, it's not. It's not gonna let us leave, Jack. What are you talking about? That's the same sign. That is the same sign as before. It's the same fucking sign, you know it is! No, Ang, Ang, Ang, Ang, Ang, calm down, calm down. - No, no, no, no. - Hey, hey, hey. I'm not going back there. You are losing it, okay? We've been walking in the same fucking direction for over an hour. We're walking in fucking circles, watch. Come on. Bingo. Oh shit! Hey. Come on, piece of shit. Fuck it. Oh shit. Come on, you fucking hillbillies, no more games! Shit. Oh, what the fuck are you? Free us. Free us, Kevin. Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Free us. Back the fuck up! Free us. Free us. I will fucking waste you with this thing. Free us. What are you doing here? You guys okay? Yeah, we're fine. Woods are just bigger than I thought. Where's Kevin? I found him in one of the cabins. He went to go check out the symbols in the shack. Did you find the rest of them? I think so. Guys? Kevin. Kevin, come in. Oh god. Jack, don't go in! Jack! Jack! I can't find him! Kevin! You see him? Jack! What was that? Wait, wait, wait, wait. I've hid in here before. I can't. Lord Jesus Christ! Lord Jesus Christ, I place myself at the foot of your cross and ask you to surround me with your holy light. Forgive me... Ang! Come on, come on, come on. I'm sorry, Johnny, I had to. I had to bring her back. She's been in my head ever since that night. You left me there. Left them to take me. But I got away. I fought them so hard and I got away. At least, I thought I did. She was everywhere. I couldn't take it. But you, you forgot. So I had to find you. Logical. And we bring the dead back to life. I'm Jack Wilson. Join us. No, no, no, no. No more fighting, not anymore. I just wanna be free. Stay there. It's okay. It's okay. You're fine. How did I get here? Your mother and the sheriff found you. Emma. She's here too. She explained everything. What? That Kevin fell in the creek and you jumped in to save him. Where are the kids? At home with a sitter. You know what, I have a great idea. Why don't I grab the iPad and we can FaceTime them? Yeah. I'll be back. - Hey. - Hi. Is he okay for visitors? Of course. We did it, Jack. We're finally free. What did you do? It must have worked. I don't feel her with me anymore. Maybe you were right, maybe it was the symbols. I don't know, but we did it. You get away from me. I'm so sorry, Jack. The girls are dying to see you. You up for a hello? I'll give you two a minute. Hi, girls. Guess who wants to say hello? Daddy! Sweetie. Are you okay? Yeah, uh, Daddy just bumped his head a little. Be home soon. Daddy, you have to meet Annie. Annie? Our babysitter. She looks just like the lady in my dreams. Come on, you two. She said to thank you, Daddy, and she needed two more kids for her family and me and Monet were it. I love you, Daddy. Wait. No, no, Haley, Monet! - Jack? - Haley! No, wait, wait! No!
