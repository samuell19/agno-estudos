Sorry for askin'. - My bad, Miya. You know, she had a bad night, her man in jail, he still aint shit, but she good though. - What the fuck is goin' on with you? - I'm still shook up from last night. I cannot believe we got away with that. Pam, he could have killed us. I think we killed him. - I know. What the fuck is you doin'? - What? This? Just a little somethin' I picked up. - So you've been walkin' around with a $25,000 purse jumpin' out of 2013 Camry and drawin' attention? - They gonna say it was photoshopped anyway. - Keisha, stop playin' Get rid of the purse. - No, listen, I earned this. Thinkin' about gettin' you one too. What you waitin' on. - I have to agree, what are we waiting on? That was a $100,000 lick. Divided three ways? We deserve it. - We risked our lives, three times. - Naw, the first one don't count. No, it does count. And it would have been over $120. The other was $33,000. And when Sean see that purse, He gonna kill us all. We got to think smarter. - Look, you may be the brains, but you aint gotta think for me. I'm goin' to the mall, you wanna come? - No, you's a petty bitch, you know it? - Girl, the only reason you doin' this, is to bail some bum ass dude out of jail, and I don't tell you to throw away, your cut. - This comin' from a ho, who's nigga's a dope fiend. - Oh whoa, whoa, whoa. Y'all, damn, chill out. - Chill out? That's your girl, over there, proppin' up weak shit. - Hold up. You aint gotta put me on no other bitch. - Look, here, you been on some bull shit all day. - Me?

Where do I go to pay your bail, and when do you get out? - Hold on a second. There are procedures that we have to go through, before we do that. Listen, go home, and we will give you a call. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Baby, go home. And we'll get the paperwork together, today. Then we'll have it ready for you tomorrow. - Okay. - I love you. - Shit. (tense music) - Listen, James. You know, we really can't believe anything she is sayin' right now, right? - What you mean? - Do you really think she has $33,000 in her purse? She couldn't even sell your drugs for you, where's she gonna get that kind of money? Get your head back in the game. She just tryin' to see what in it for her. There is no way, she has $33,000 in her purse. Where would she get that kind of money? There's no way, she has that kind of money in her purse.
