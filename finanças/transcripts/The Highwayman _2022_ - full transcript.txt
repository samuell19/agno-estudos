(dramatic music) (wind howling) (hooves clomping) (horse neighing) (dramatic music continues) (birds chirping) (hooves clomping) (dramatic music continues) (leaves rustling) (dramatic music continues) (leaves rustling) (tree squeaking) Is the carriage coming? (dramatic music continues) (hooves clomping) (dramatic music continues) (gun firing) (horse neighing) (dramatic music continues) You in the carriage, your money or your life. (dramatic music continues) (birds chirping) (door rattling) (gun shooting) It's a trap! (dramatic music continues) (fighters grunting) (gun firing) (dramatic music continues) (fighters grunting) (leaves rustling) (dramatic music continues) (cloth rustling) - [Soldier] It's Turpin. - (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music) (ominous music) (fire crackling) (lock thumping) (footsteps thumping) (ominous music continues) (fire crackling) You finally awake then, Turpin? I wasn't asleep, I was unconscious. I vaguely remember you slamming your fist into my face. Must be your lucky day then 'cause here's another one. (fist thumping) (Dick grunting) (fire crackling) Now that's what you get for trying to rob the town magistrate. I didn't know he was a magistrate. Well, here's the funny thing. He's also the one that's gonna be deciding your sentence. He's already done your accomplices, by the way. What did they get? Seven years transportation. Do you know what that means? They'll be separated out up north to the islands where they'll be doing a little bit of hard labor. You'll likely never see 'em again, Turpin. (ominous music continues) (fire crackling) - What happened to my horse? - Your horse? She is very valuable to me. Yeah, well, not as valuable as she was to her actual owner. A man with the name of Major came forward and claimed her last night. Major was too handy with a whip. She preferred to be ridden by me. Ah, did she now? Well, perhaps we can put her on the stand at your hearing, say a few good words for you (laughs). I'm only joking, there's not gonna be any hearing. No point in having a trial, Turpin, not with all this damning evidence we've got here. (ominous music continues) (footsteps thumping) One robber's hat, one robber's mask, one robber's pistol. So I have seven years' hard labor to look forward to? You don't look like you'd last seven days. But with you being the leader of the gang and an notorious outlaw in your own right, there's only one sentence he could pass down. (ominous music continues) (fire crackling) (birds chirping) (hooves clomping) (dramatic music) (The Earl sighing) Not today, you promised you wouldn't. It's this infernal carriage. Constant rocking puts me on edge. Then pay to have the wheels repaired. You know I would, only there are other priorities. You mean the kind of priorities that come in a bottle? That's not fair. Well, where do you think all these beautiful dresses and jewelry come from? Now, this jewelry was my mother's and this dress belonged to cousin Charlotte. She doesn't need it anymore, not now she's married. You know, it was your mother's dearest wish that you should marry well. No, it wasn't, that's your dearest wish. Mother said that I should marry for love. We could afford to be idealistic then. Times have changed, Elizabeth. The old estate is crumbling. There's barely a skeleton staff. If you could suitably impress Mr. Winthroppe, it might be our last chance to hang onto Hargreave Hall. Mister? How is it that my father is the Earl of Pembroke, yet my supposed husband to be has no title at all? He's what they call new nouveau riche, (laughs) a businessman. I'm sure you'll find him quite charming. - (gentle music) - We'll see. (ominous music) (fire crackling) Beheading, they still do that around here? Not as a rule, no, but there's a rather influential local gentleman who had a few words with the magistrate, persuaded him to bring the old ax man out of retirement. What local gentleman? Somebody who wanted to make quite sure you were dead. Perhaps he's got a grudge against ya. (ominous music continues) (fire crackling) You know the sad thing is, if I am to be executed, no one will find out where I hid it. - Hid what? - The loot, of course, from all the robberies, Such a shame all that money going to waste. - How much money? - Don't know. There was so much, I never got around to counting it. We just threw it all in a wooden box with the jewelry and gold pieces. Buried it in the woods not far from here. - Where? - Why should I tell you? If I dug it up, it wouldn't go a waste. And what do I care if I'm going to be executed? - I can help ya. - How? - Put it a good word. - With who, the executioner? Don't knock it, Turpin. It can be the difference between a single clean slice through the neck or a botched hacking around the shoulders that could go on for hours. Now that old man, he's very old. Could take him a good few swings to get the job done if I don't give him a hand with it. (ominous music continues) (fire crackling) (birds chirping) (hooves clomping) [The Earl] What's that you're reading? - (book thumping) - Just some poetry. So how did Mr. Winthroppe come to acquire his wealth if he wasn't born into it? I'm a little hazy about the details, but I understand it's about investing in land and then digging up coal. He's a manual laborer? No, no, he doesn't dig it up himself. He owns a mine, Elizabeth. He employs dozens of people. We used to employ dozens of people. And we will again, as long as you play your cards right. - (fire crackling) - Well? - All right, I'll tell you. - (ominous music) Well, come closer. You don't want anyone outside these four walls to hear, do you? (ominous music continues) (fire crackling) (footsteps thumping) Closer, I want to whisper in your ear. (ominous music continues) Closer. (ominous music continues) (keys rattling) (ominous music continues) (dramatic music) (keys rattling) (dramatic music continues) (footsteps thumping) (Turnip panting) Oh, oh, damn, I need to find a horse. (ominous music) (door rattling) - Very nice. - (dramatic music) It's hardly Hargreave hall. Of course it isn't. They don't build houses like that anymore. This is brand new, commissioned and built to Winthroppe's own design. And around the back, there are great tracts of land all the way down to the mine. I tell you, Winthroppe is a man of means. Remember to flutter your eyelashes. (dramatic music continues) (footsteps thumping) Most of the coal extraction going on in England today is horribly primitive, pits of only 50 feet deep with no supporting structure at all. Very dangerous for the workers. - I see. - There was an incident in Wales just over a year ago, where there was a huge explosion, which took down an entire shaft, trapping a dozen men. And the worst of it was, they were still alive. They could be heard tapping on their helmets, trying to get a message out from the rubble. Nothing could be done, of course. Went on for days, apparently. But that's why I insist in the highest safety standards. My shaft is the longest in the country. It goes deeper than anyone else's, over 200 feet deep. Hear that, Elizabeth, 200 feet? And might a man breathe the air that far down? Well, with our patented air pumping system, he can. Fascinating, and what do people do with all this coal you're digging up? Why aren't you mining for gold or silver? - They burn it. - [The Earl] Hmm? Answer me this, sir, if you will, how much firewood does it take to heat up Hargreave Hall during the winter months? (sighs) Half of forest, it seems. This house was built with a coal cellar, a room no bigger than this, beneath our feet. The coal in that cellar will heat up this entire property from October to March. - Extraordinary. - You must allow me to give you a tour of the mine someday. That will be marvelous. Tell me, this mine of yours, what kind of income might a set up like this generate on an annual basis? More than enough to keep a young lady in a manner to which she is accustomed, I can assure you. And what about an old man? Well, my business manager, Mr. Arkwright, is as we speak writing up a contract, which I'm sure will allay all your concerns. Contract, what sort of contract? A marriage contract. (dramatic music continues) (tree creaking) (birds chirping) (gravel crunching) Did you hear that, Elizabeth? A marriage contract! - You did it. - I don't know what I did. He barely gave me a passing glance. Well, obviously, he's too much of a gentleman to talk to you directly until after the marriage. It's a sign of good breeding. He seemed far more interested in talking business with you. That's another good sign. I must have a good look at this proposal of his. I'm expecting a large stake in that mine. He's not getting his hands on my only daughter for nothing. Getting his hands on me? Ugh, you make it sound awfully tawdry. And I haven't agreed to anything yet. (gentle music) (tree squeaking) An opportunity like this will not come along again, Elizabeth, not at your age. Is Hargreave Hall really at risk? Well, I didn't want to say anything, but the East wing has already been stripped. Paintings, furniture, anything of value, gone. But that's where I grew up. All my childhood memories are of the East wing. So now you can see how important this marriage is. (gentle music continues) (birds chirping) (hooves clomping) Well, I will admit he's not completely unattractive. That's the spirit. I tell you, he'd make an excellent suitor. He's tall, he's wealthy, he's got huge tracts of land. (ominous music) (leaves crunching) (hooves clomping) (dramatic music) It's all happening terribly fast. At this rate, you'll have me married off by the end of the week. We can but hope (laughs). (dramatic music continues) (hooves clomping) [Dick] Stand and deliver. (horse neighing) (dramatic music continues) Your money or your life. What the devil's going on out there? [Dick] You in the carriage, show yourselves. (door rattling) (dramatic music continues) (birds chirping) (gravel crunching) And who might you be, sir? Who are you to ask who I am, standing there, blocking the road, making demands with menaces? Now the question is, sir, who the devil are you? [Dick] My name, sir, is Turpin. Perhaps you've heard of me and my notorious gang. I heard you'd been arrested. [Dick] No jail can hold me, sir, or my gang, who are at this moment in the trees surrounding your carriage. And I must warn you, they are all armed and prepared to die. Well, I am the Earl of Pembroke. And if you have any sense of decency, sir, you'll stand side. [Dick] The Earl of Pembroke? That sounds impressive, you must be very wealthy. My financial standing, sir, is no business of yours. [Dick] I'm making it my business. Now hand over whatever items of value you have in that carriage. We are not carrying any items of values, sir. [Dick] Really? The Earl of Pembroke travels the country without a penny in his pocket? Being an Earl isn't what it was, sir. [Dick] There must be something worth having in there. Daddy, who are you talking to? Elizabeth, get back inside. [Dick] Well, well, I thought you said there was nothing of value in that carriage. Sir, sir, she's my only daughter. [Dick] Relax, your earlship. I was talking about the necklace. Elizabeth, is it? - Come over here. - Elizabeth, it's Turpin, the famous outlaw (chuckles). Don't let him lay a finger on you. You're betrothed, remember? [Dick] That's it, come along. My gang don't want to be kept waiting. (gentle music) (footsteps thumping) Are you sure you've got a gang? [Dick] They're out there in the trees. Even now, they have their pistols trained on you and your father. Now come along, hand over the necklace. I can't see anyone. Just give me the necklace. (book thumping) (gentle music continues) (birds chirping) I do believe you're bluffing. He's bluffing, Daddy, he hasn't got a gang. [Dick] Right, that's it, nobody move. You've really gone and bloody done it now. You're in big trouble. Now, Turpin, don't be hasty. [Dick] The young lady is coming with me, and if any of you move an inch in the next 10 minutes, my gang will let you have it. (dramatic music) (birds chirping) How dare you lay a hand on me. I am sorry, your ladyship, I didn't plan it this way. Where are you taking me? I don't know, I'm making this up as I go. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (dramatic music) (door squeaking) - (footsteps thumping) - Ah, Mr. Arkwright, just the man, is the marriage contract drawn up yet? Yes, sir, I have it here. Complete with all the special clauses I requested? - Yes, of course, but I must... - Excellent. Leave it on the table and I'll have a message sent to the Earl, inviting him back at his soonest convenience. Please, Mr. Winthroppe, sir, I must talk to you about this land survey report. It's as I feared. - [Henry] Let me see. - (tree squeaking) The men dug test pits every 200 yards in a circular formation. - What did they find? - Nothing. (ominous music) Nothing, they found no coal at all? Not a bit of it, I'm afraid. It appears that the coal seam that you found initially was what they call an outlier, a one-off. There's nothing else like it in a surrounding area. This is quite unusual really. I spent 100 pounds on that survey. And all the land I purchased? Largely worthless, I'm afraid. I suppose you could rear cattle on it, except. - Except what? - The land's covered in dangerous pits now. You'd be forever dragging the animals out of the holes. You could spend another 100 pounds to have the holes filled in, I suppose. How could it cost the same amount filling them in as to dig them out? Surely it's half the work. Well, that's a question for the surveyors. But I'm afraid, what with this and the situation with the mine, well, that leaves you in a bit of a precarious situation, I think. How about the other survey? Ah, now, well, that tip certainly paid off. As good as we hoped? Better, it's astonishing what people have in their possession and have no idea that they've got it. Then we're fine, as long as this marriage contract of yours stands up. Well, it will, once there's a signature on it. Leave that with me. But sir, what about the situation - with the mine? - Yes? Well, there's barely any coal left to extract. Tell them to dig deeper, another 10 feet. Well, the last 10 feet didn't really reveal anything. I don't care. I just need to keep up the appearance of business as usual. I don't need to tell you how many loans I took out against that mine for all that bloody worthless land. No, of course, sir, did you...? Were you aware the mine was in trouble when you took those loans out? And what if I was? I would have recommended strongly against it. It could be seen as deliberate fraud. Mm, and whose signature is at the bottom of all those loan agreements. Mr. Arkwright? Well, it's mine. - Thank you, Mr. - Arkwright, good day. I was signing on your behalf. (laughs) I do it all the time. - Good day. - (gentle music) (paper rustling) (footsteps thumping) (birds chirping) (tree creaking) Do either of you two have some sort of time piece? Just wondering if 10 minutes has passed yet. (birds chirping) - (footsteps thumping) - Ow! You don't exactly blend in, do you? What do you mean? - [Dick] That dress. - It was rather intended to make me stand out. I can see that. I'm afraid it's the last thing we need right now. How long do you think it'll be before your father has people out combing the woods for us? Come on. (tree squeaking) (mischievous music) (tree creaking) That's it, turn us around, straight back to Winthroppe's. He'll know what to do. (mischievous music continues) (leaves rustling) - Shh. - What are you doing? - Stealing this. - Is that all you know how to do, steal things? All right, I'm borrowing it. Haven't you ever borrowed anything, your ladyship? This dress is borrowed from my cousin. Well, there you are then. I promise I'll give it back when I'm out of trouble. Are you ever out of trouble? Occasionally, come on. (mischievous music continues) (birds chirping) (dramatic music) (hooves thumping) - Winthroppe! - (dramatic music continues) - This is appalling. - Turpin, did you say? Yes, he's a well known outlaw. Yes, I'm very well aware of his nefarious activities. In fact, I thought he was in jail. Well, apparently, he's free and he's graduated from burglary to kidnapping. Don't worry, we'll get Elizabeth back. O'Reilly. (door rattling) (door squeaking) He works for me in various capacities. To take you back to where the kidnapping took place. You'll know what to do from there. - Yes, sir. - (birds chirping) (ominous music) (footsteps thumping) (leaves rustling) (birds chirping) Here, put this on. That thing, ugh, it's probably infested with something. Come along, your ladyship, we haven't got all day. And in any case, you should hardly expect me to change my dress out here in the middle of the forest. Oh, for the love of, you know, you're almost more trouble than you're worth. And what am I worth? Well, I recently lost the use of an excellent horse. A horse. So what do you propose to do, ride on me? Let's not get ahead of ourselves. What I propose to do is to request a ransom from your father for your safe return. I'm sure the Earl of Pembroke keeps an excellent stable. He used to, not anymore. (mischievous music) (tree squeaking) (ominous music) (horse neighing) He must have some money, - at least. - Not really. Well, surely it takes a considerable income just to maintain such a large estate. (ominous music continues) (birds chirping) He started selling off family heirlooms. I'd be absolutely distraught if we lost Hargreave Hall. Oh, bugger me, I know how to pick 'em, don't I? I must have the daughter of the only earl in England who's flat broke. You'd have been better off waiting - until I was married. - Yes? (ominous music continues) (birds chirping) [O'Reilly] Turpin, give me the girl. - (dramatic music) - Who's that, someone who works for your father? I have no idea. (dramatic music continues) (birds chirping) (leaves rustling) Let's make a deal, for her safe return, I want a good horse and 50 gold sovereigns. (gun firing) (dramatic music continues) (birds chirping) Okay, I'll take the horse and 20 gold sovereigns. (gun firing) (dramatic music continues) (birds chirping) Okay, just the horse, I'll just take the horse. [O'Reilly] You'll get nothing, give me the girl. And then we'll say no more about it? [O'Reilly] No, then I'll take your head. That's what I thought. (dramatic music continues) (leaves rustling) Come on, let's go. Not right now, I afraid he's got us outgunned. We need to find somewhere to hole up for the night. It'll be dark soon, come on. (dramatic music continues) (birds chirping) (fire crackling) (liquid sloshing) Here, this will steady the nerves. - Ah, perfect. - Now, there's no need to be too concerned. My man O'Reilly never fails me. What did you say his line of work was? A little bit of everything, really. Especially the things one wishes to be done discreetly. - I see. - Now, if you'd like to take a seat at the table, as luck would have it, the marriage contract is ready for your perusal. (gentle music) (rain splattering) (door creaking) Well, this will do for the night. It most certainly will not. Wait, what are you doing? I'm sorry, your ladyship. - Don't you dare. - I have to protect my assets. - [Elizabeth] Ow! - Sorry, what's this book? Can you even read? Of course I can read. Just don't have the time right now. Now where are you going? (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) To get some essentials. But you can't just leave me here like this. Don't worry, I'll be back. (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) (door rattling) (thunder rumbling) (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) Does it say 50%? Yes, that's right. Once Elizabeth and I are married, 50% of all profits from the mine will be made over to you. That's very generous. Nothing's too good for my future father-in-law. And what's this about Hargreave Hall? Well, the hall and the surrounding estate will be made over to my stewardship. - Stewardship? - Well, think on this, in your later years, do you really want be burdened with maintaining such a vast building? Not to mention all the land and the gardens. You'd take care of all that? Well, I could so long as the estate was under my stewardship. Do you have an ink pen to hand, sir? (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) (door rattling) Good evening, your ladyship. (goblet rattling) - Where have you been? - (match crackling) I went back to that little shack in the woods. There was no one home, so I borrowed a few essentials. I thought you might be hungry, so I brought dinner. (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) I'm not hungry. This isn't so you can eat, it's so you can change. I told you I'm not wearing that. It's clean, I stole it off a washing line, remember? (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) You stick out a mile in that dress and I'm afraid it's not a risk I'm prepared to take a moment longer. I'm afraid I really must insist. (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) If you were a gentleman, you'd turn your back. I'm an outlaw, not a gentleman, but still. (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) What kind of an occupation is that anyway? [Dick] Outlaw? I do all right. Spending the night in smelly barns, is that what you consider doing all right? I'm sorry if the accommodation isn't up to your usual standards, your ladyship. Will you stop calling me that? [Dick] What, your ladyship? I am not a lady. (dramatic music) (rain splattering) You could have fooled me. Stop gawking at me. (dramatic music continues) (rain splattering) I meant I do not hold the title of a lady. How do you get that then? You marry a lord. Well, never mind, I'm sure you will. (dramatic music continues) (rain splattering) Didn't you say something about getting married? That is none of your business. You don't sound too happy about it. Isn't he a lord, then? I told you that is none your business. Wait a minute, you said that I'd be better off waiting 'til you got married. - What did you mean by that? - Nothing. He's got money, hasn't he, your fiance? That's what you meant, is it a lord? - No. - Or a duke? - No. - Not a prince. No, he isn't anything, just some nouveau riche upstart named Winthroppe (sighs). (dramatic music continues) (rain splattering) Winthroppe? (gentle music) (rain splattering) Well, it all seems satisfactory. (ominous music) (rain splattering) Mind you (chuckles), I must warn you, Elizabeth can be a feisty young thing. You're gonna have your work cut out, that's for certain. I've never been one to back away from a challenge, sir. (thunder droning) (rain splattering) How did you acquire your fortune? Must have taken quite a bit of capital, purchasing the land, setting up the mine in the first place. Well, I've always been involved in one form of business or another, ever since I was a boy. I've always been just a little bit better at it than everyone else. Hmm, you parents must be very proud of you. Will they be attending the wedding? No, I'm afraid not. They both passed away some time ago. - Oh. - (ominous music continues) - Aunts, uncles, cousins? - Nope. - Shame. - (ominous music continues) You know, I adore Elizabeth, but well, sometimes I do wish he had a younger brother, a young man who might make his own way in the world, achieve something to be proud of. The trouble with daughters is they just sit there, looking pretty. Well, you know what they say about a marriage, it's not so much losing a daughter, but gaining a son. Just your signature at the bottom. (rain splattering) (ominous music continues) - Shouldn't we have a witness? - What? - To the signature? - Well. (door squeaking) (ominous music continues) Ah, O'Reilly, perfect timing. Would you please witness the earl's signature? Well, wait a minute, what about Turpin? Gave me the slip, I have a fair idea where they're headed, though. You see, everything is under control. As I've always said, O'Reilly never fails me. Please, just your signature, if you will. - Mm, oh. - (ominous music continues) To tell you about Winthroppe. What would a man like you know of him? More than you seem to. He's 10 times the thief I'll ever be. Are you sure you're not jealous? - Jealous? - Yes, why not? He's wealthy, successful, not to mention handsome. I found him quite impressive. You don't know him very well at all, do you? For your information, I happen to have spent several hours in his company. Several hours (laughs), and that's enough to decide to marry him? You have no idea how society marriages work, do you? You're such a peasant, Turpin. Call me Dick. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Listen, I'm trying to tell you something important. I wasn't always an outlaw, you know? What were you before? A butcher's apprentice. Oh, so you know how to carve up a dead animal? When I was a butcher's apprentice, this group of lads started coming to the shop with deer carcasses they wanted to sell. So I didn't think anything of it. (gentle music) (straw rustling) It was all fine, until one night, these lads came and said they were a man short and they needed my help hunting the deer. Is it normal to hunt deer at night? No, but I didn't know that. It turns out they were poaching the deer from the royal forest at Waltham. By the time we got there that night, it was too late to back out. And by the end of that night, I was as guilty as the rest of them. The trouble was it wasn't just poaching they were getting up to. Soon enough, it was horse theft and burglary. I knew you were a scoundrel. I was a boy, not even 20. And there was another young lad in the group, even younger than I was. (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) And believe it or not, he was the ringleader, probably because he was the most ruthless. Always carried a dagger strapped to his back. Anyway, it all fell to pieces one night when we were caught during a burglary in Hampshire, when an old man was killed. Killed, who did it? I don't know, I was in another part of the house at the time. I have my suspicions. (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) Anyway, once we were all in jail, this young lad pretended that we'd forced him into it, ratted us all out and gave up a huge stash of loot we had hidden in the woods. Probably because he was barely old enough to shave, they believed him. (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) We all got sentenced to the noose and he got a bloody reward. (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) And do you know what that rat's name was? - Not Winthroppe. - No. People called Winthroppe don't go around poaching deer. This lad's name was Jack Jones. Then why are you telling me this? Because after the trial, this young lad took his reward money and disappeared. I heard a rumor that he'd moved to this part of the country and bought himself a piece of land, tried to reinvent himself as a bit of a gentleman. (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) I never had any proof, but I thought seeing as me and my gang were in the area, I'd have a little sniff around. (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) And from what I've seen and heard, your Mr. Winthroppe is almost certainly my Jack Jones. (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) There, it's done. (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) You may not understand this, Winthroppe, as a father, one takes one's responsibility to one's family very seriously, and to the family estate. Knowing that Elizabeth and Hargreave Hall are in a safe pair of hands gives one huge satisfaction. It's liberating, it's almost as if having signed this, I'm no longer required at all. (gentle music) (rain splattering) It's funny you should say that. I feel the same way. About you, I mean. - [The Earl] Mm? - (ominous music) (dramatic music) (The Earl grunting) (dramatic music continues) (The Earl thumping) (dramatic music continues) Careful, O'Reilly, he's drooling all over it. (ominous music) (rain splattering) Now you better make damn sure you can get Elizabeth back. - [O'Reilly] No problem. - If I play this right, Elizabeth will be begging me to have Turpin dealt with as harshly as possible. (ominous music continues) (rain splattering) What an absolute load of nonsense. I knew you were jealous. I am not jealous, the man is a criminal. That's rich coming from you. I may be thief, but I'm not a murderer. The whole story makes no sense. You said you were sentenced to hang, yet here you are. - I managed to escape. - Oh, how convenient. (rain splattering) (mischievous music) We'll spend one night here, and then in the morning, I'll take you to your Mr. Winthroppe for whatever ransom I can get. (mischievous music continues) (straw rustling) Am I supposed to sleep on the floor? (mischievous music continues) (rain splattering) - You can have the blanket. - (blanket rustling) (mischievous music continues) (rain splattering) You better not come near me. I can assure you, your ladyship, you have nothing to worry about. (mischievous music continues) (rain splattering) (birds chirping) I'm sorry to bother you so early, Mr. Winthroppe, but you did say in the morning. [Henry] Is that the report I've been waiting for? More bad news, I'm afraid, news from the mine. Oh, what is it this time? Well, you know the men are digging deeper and deeper, what with the upper levels drying up? Well, apparently the deeper you go, the greater the risk of a buildup of noxious gases. Yes, I know that. That's what the air pump system is for. Well, the foreman told me that it hadn't been working for weeks. I do recall hearing something about that. 17 men were overwhelmed, one nearly died. Well, we are running a mine, not a workers' welfare association. There are bound to be some casualties. That's part of the job. Besides, I'm not gonna repair the air pumps. Why is that? Is to rid the shaft of combustible gases. - Yes. - Well, it just occurred to me that should there be an explosion in the shaft, it could render the mine inoperable. No, but that will be a disaster. Only for my insurers. People will be killed. Again, not a problem for me personally. I most assuredly won't be anywhere near the site when it happens. Do the insurers know the current value of the mine, given that there's no damned coal to be found in it? I'm getting a little bit tired of your remonstrations, Arkwright. Now let me see report. (gentle music) (tree squeaking) (paper rustling) (birds chirping) The men began by digging outside the Eastern boundary of the estate. By digging in diagonally, they were able to see the start of a new coal seam just inside the boundary. The surveyor thinks that the best place to sink the shaft would be here. On top of the hall? Well, underneath the hall to be precise. It would have to be demolished of course to make way for it. Excellent, looks like we're back in business. If this all goes to plan, the old mine can go to the crows, for all I care. Assuming the earl signs the contract, of course. It's already done. And the wedding goes ahead as planned? The law is very precise about that. You have to be related to the earl, by marriage or otherwise, for you to take full advantage of the estate. It's all in hand. (ominous music) (birds chirping) Where is the earl, by the way? Well, his presence was no longer required. For his own daughter's wedding? Is he not going to walk her down the aisle? I wasn't aware that was a legal necessity. Besides the earl sadly passed away in the night. - (ominous music continues) - What, after he'd signed the contract? Fortunately for us, yes. This is all very strange. Even by your standards, Mr. Winthroppe. By my standards? I've gone along with a lot of your schemes, but this just doesn't sit right with me, this one. Since the contract's signed and the survey's completed, I'd rather have no further part in this. Well, I'm sorry you feel that way, Arkwright. As it happens, I do have no further requirements you need fulfill. Very good, I'll be on my way then. There is just one more thing in regards to the late earl. - Yes? - Well, I have some good news. You'll soon be joining him. - (birds chirping) - What? (suspenseful music) (Arkwright grunting) (suspenseful music continues) (knife whooshing) - No! - Nobody goes against me, Arkwright, you should know that by now. (suspenseful music continues) (Arkwright grunting) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (footsteps thumping) (gentle music continues) (birds chirping) Now, fetch me a bride. What about Turpin? I think it's best to let the authorities deal with Turpin. I've already ensured he'll get an immediate death sentence. Oh, while you're out, inquire where one might purchase some explosives. (dramatic music) (wood creaking) (birds chirping) - (straw rustling) - Elizabeth! Wake up, your ladyship. (birds chirping) (pages rustling) (tree squeaking) Elizabeth! (tree squeaking) Oh, what the hell, Elizabeth? (dramatic music) - [Elizabeth] Quiet. - Ah. I don't have to listen to your nonsense anymore, Turpin. - Untie me. - And then what? I'm going to get Mr. Winthroppe and he'll know exactly what to do with you. He'll kill me. It's no more than you deserve. But Mr. Winthroppe is a gentleman. I'm sure he will do nothing of the sort. In which case, he'll hand me over to the authorities and they'll kill me, is that what you want? It couldn't happen to a more deserving fellow. Well, now I know that's how you feel. Keep back, I'll pull the trigger. I'm sure you will. I mean it. (dramatic music continues) (birds chirping) I thought you were gonna pull the trigger. (gentle music) (birds chirping) Are you truly not afraid to die? (gentle music continues) Not really, a pistol needs gun powder and a lead ball to fire. (gun clicking) This is empty. You mean all that time, you've been waving that thing around? I was never gonna shoot anybody. (gentle music continues) (birds chirping) Come on, let's go. Don't you have a plan, I mean, to get away? I'll think of something. I told you I'm making this up as I go. (gentle music continues) (footsteps thumping) (dramatic music) (leaves crunching) (birds chirping) (door rattling) (dramatic music continues) (birds chirping) (leaves crunching) (birds chirping) I could just walk away, couldn't I? (dramatic music) (leaves crunching) And you couldn't do anything. Do you know your way out this forest? (dramatic music continues) (birds chirping) (leaves crunching) (dramatic music continues) [O'Reilly] Turpin, the girl's coming with me now. Is that thing even loaded? My pistol's always ready to fire. Listen, if you work for a man named Winthroppe, (dramatic music) (fighters grunting) (Dick thumping) (dramatic music continues) (birds chirping) (fire crackling) (ominous music) (lock rattling) (footsteps thumping) (ominous music continues) (fire crackling) Well, well, well, if it ain't my old friend, Dick Turpin. - Hello again. - (Dick grunting) (ominous music continues) (fire crackling) I ever tell you about the stash of loot I have hidden? (ominous music continues) (fire crackling) (fist thumping) (birds chirping) It's such a relief to have you back, Elizabeth. We were all getting so terribly worried. (birds chirping) (tree squeaking) Turpin is such a villain. He could have done anything to you. (birds chirping) (tree squeaking) Did he do anything to you? No, I'm fine, thank you. (birds chirping) (tree squeaking) Well, the good news is we're moving forward at a pace. We've got an urgent appointment with the Reverend Peters this afternoon. The Reverend Peters? Well, we are due to be married after all, Elizabeth. Where is my father, is he here? In the manner of speaking. (somber music) (birds chirping) I'm sorry to say that your father succumbed in the night to the unbearable stresses of the situation, vis-a-vis your kidnapping by the aforementioned Turpin. He's currently laid out downstairs, awaiting transportation to the church. (somber music continues) (birds chirping) - What? - There's no need to worry. I've spoken with the Reverend and he's agreed to perform a sort of combined wedding and funeral. So as I say, there's really no need to worry. It's at three o'clock, so you have plenty of time to clean yourself up. (somber music continues) (birds chirping) You actually want to get married today? There's no time like the present, Elizabeth. It's what your father would've wanted. (somber music continues) (birds chirping) It's all that Turpin's fault, really. The man's a veritable monster. Thank goodness he's now incarcerated in the local jail, ready for the executioner's ax this afternoon. What, the executioner's ax? Well, he has escaped the noose before, Elizabeth. This time we'll be certain he's dead. (somber music continues) (birds chirping) (papers rustling) (somber music continues) (birds chirping) (papers rustling) - What's this? - (dramatic music) It's just some business papers, Elizabeth, nothing you'd understand. It's my father's estate, that's our house. It's just something I was discussing with your father before his untimely passing. (paper rustling) (dramatic music continues) It's a building plan. - Elizabeth. - It's a mine. It just so happens that Hargreave Hall is sitting on top of a rich vein of very accessible coal. Accessible, how can it be accessible if it's underneath the house? If the house was no longer there. You want to knock down Hargreave Hall and build a bloody great mine in its place! The return on the investment will be phenomenal, Elizabeth. That's my house! The earl was in complete agreement. You're a liar, my father would have never have agreed to this. - O'Reilly. - (dramatic music continues) Let's not make things unpleasant, Elizabeth. (dramatic music continues) (birds chirping) Your feelings not withstanding, the earl was in complete agreement and signed all the necessary paperwork. All that is now required for me to acquire full control of Hargreave Hall is for us to get married. That is going to happen today at three o'clock, whether you like it or not. (dramatic music continues) (Dick grunting) - (fire crackling) - That's for the beating you gave me yesterday. - Oh, so we're even. - Not even close. We'll be even come three o'clock this afternoon when your head's on the chopping block. - Three o'clock? - Yeah, that's right. They're expecting quite a crowd, you being a famous highwayman and all that. (fire crackling) (bells ringing) - What's that? - (bells ringing) It's the local church across the road. (bells ringing) (fire crackling) It's two o'clock. (ominous music) You got an hour to live. You best make the most of it. (ominous music continues) (fire crackling) This is all very irregular. We normally ask that the happy couple attend services for three months prior to the wedding. Yes, I do appreciate that, Reverent, but in this case, time is very much of the essence. Ah, I see, well, these things do happen. And when is the young lady due? - Half past two. - I'm sorry. For a three o'clock wedding. She'll be arriving at half past two. Ah, yes, of course. And I'm sure a suitably large donation to the church funds would help cover any additional costs due to these irregularities. Well, of course there are always costs associated with a wedding, of course, the church fee, my own fee, the choir fee, the organist's fee and other miscellaneous expenses. Then we understand each other. I believe we do. (dramatic music) (fire crackling) (ominous music) Listen, I need to tell you something. You think I'm gonna fall for the same trick again, Turpin? It's not that. Listen, I have some important information about a local gentleman called Winthroppe. - Do you know of him? - Of course I do. Me brother-in-law works down his mine. Half the people in this town owe their livelihood to Mr. Winthroppe. He's a great man, one of the best. - (ominous music continues) - Oh. So, what's this valuable information? - Never mind. - (ominous music continues) (bells ringing) Relax, Turpin, it ain't three O'clock yet. What are the bells for? - Must be a wedding. - A wedding? (ominous music continues) (bells ringing) (footsteps thumping) (O'Reilly grunting) (bells ringing) Shall we get on with it? - Don't touch me. - Shut up! But it isn't three o'clock yet, the choir hasn't arrived. Oh, we can do without the hymns, Reverend. I'd sooner get this over with. Very well, music, please. (dramatic organ music) What's the matter? Haven't you ever heard of a shotgun wedding? (dramatic music continues) (fire crackling) Are you sure those bells are to signify a wedding? Pretty sure, it's funny though, they don't normally have weddings on a Thursday. Must be a rush job. (fire crackling) (ominous music) Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony, which is an honorable estate instituted by God in the time of man's innocence, signifying the mystical union between Christ and his church. This union, which Christ adorned and beautified by His presence and was commended by St. Paul to be honorable amongst all men and is therefore not to be taken lightly. Yes, can we skip this bit, Reverend? We haven't got all day. (dramatic music) Yes, very well. (dramatic music continues) (ominous music) Do thou takest this woman to be thy wedded wife, to live together after God's ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony? Will thou love her, comfort, honor and keep her in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others, keep thee only unto her as long as you both shall live? - I will. - (ominous music continues) Will thou takest this man to be thy wedded husband, to live together after God's ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony, will thou love him, comfort him, honor and keep him in sickness and in health, and forsaking all of others, keep thee only unto him as long as you both shall live? (ominous music continues) - She will. - (ominous music continues) Who givest this woman to be married - to this man? - Oh, O'Reilly. (ominous music continues) (footsteps thumping) (fire crackling) (ominous music continues) What's going to happen to me? Well, just before three o'clock, there'll be a knock at the door. That'll be someone from the magistrate's office come to take you to the executioner. (somber music) (fire crackling) What about my last words? If you got anything to say, say it now, 'cause any minute, it's all gonna be over. (somber music continues) (fire crackling) (birds chirping) - And now we pray. - (dramatic music) Oh, eternal God and creator of all mankind, giver of all spiritual grace and author of everlasting life, send down Thy blessings upon these, Thy servants, this man and this woman, who we bless in Thy name, so they surely may keep and perform the vows and covenants betwixt them and ever remain in perfect peace and love, according to Your laws through Jesus Christ, our Lord, amen. And now as much as this man. What is it? I don't know your Christian name, Mr. Winthroppe. - Henry. - This man Henry - and this wo... - Elizabeth. And this woman Elizabeth have joined together in holy wedlock and witnessed as much before God, I now pronounce them to be... (dramatic music) Jesus Christ. Nobody move. You keep this ready to fire at all times, isn't that right, Mr. O'Reilly? (dramatic music continues) So all I have to do is pull the trigger and someone's losing their head. Elizabeth, let's not do anything... - Shut up! - (dramatic music continues) - Which way to the jail? - What? The jail, which way is it from here? It's out through the church gates, turn left, and it's across the street. (dramatic music continues) (footsteps thumping) She's going after Turpin. (dramatic music continues) (roses crunching) It won't be long now, Turpin. I'm looking forward to this. I've not seen a beheading since I was a little 'un. We had a kick about in the square afterwards with the head. Jesus, what sort of revolting backwater is this town? This is Winthroppe's town, bought and paid for. (ominous music) (fire crackling) (door thumping) (hands slapping) Here we go. (ominous music continues) (fire crackling) (wood scraping) (dramatic music) I'm looking for Dick. I bet you are. (pistol thumping) (gaoler grunting) - (keys rattling) - Grab his keys. - We haven't got much time. - You're telling me. (dramatic music continues) (Dick chuckling) (keys rattling) (gate rattling) (dramatic music continues) (birds chirping) - (footsteps thumping) - Wait! (gentle music) Dick, I'm sorry. You were right about Winthroppe. You were right about everything. Never mind mind about that now, Elizabeth, we've gotta get out of sight. You certainly know how to pick a dress, don't you? - (gentle music continues) - Sorry. (birds chirping) (tree squeaking) You bloody idiot, O'Reilly. How could you let her take your pistol? (ominous music) How are we going to get her back now? Don't worry about it, sir. I have a good idea where they'll be sleeping tonight. (ominous music continues) (rain splattering) (footsteps thumping) (gentle music) (rain splattering) You know, you saved my life today, Elizabeth. You could have just left me in that jail. (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) It was something Winthroppe said, but I didn't realize it until I was stood there about to be married to him. What was that? He told me that you escaped the noose before. How could he have known that unless... - Unless? - Everything you told me was the truth. (rain splattering) (gentle music continues) I'm so sorry I didn't believe you. (rain splattering) (gentle music continues) So what do you want to do? I don't know, there must be some way we can stop Winthroppe. For now, I just want to get out of this blasted dress. I can hardly breathe in it. (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) I could help you with that, if you'd like. (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) - All right. - (gentle music continues) (footsteps thumping) (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) It's all tied up at the back, like a corset. Yes, I think I've got it. Is that any better? (gasps) It feels like it. (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) - Almost there. - Yes. - [Dick] Closer? - Very close. - Almost there. - (gasps) Yes. (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) - Now what? - (Elizabeth panting) Now it just lifts over my head. (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) Like this? (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) What now? (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) Why don't you decide? (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) Well, it is your wedding night after all. (gentle music continues) (rain splattering) (ominous music) (rain splattering) What about the explosives? No, those are for the mine. Paraffin then, the whole place will go up like tinder. (ominous music continues) (rain splattering) But we've got to get the girl out first. - (ominous music continues) - That's your job. I'll deal with Turpin. (ominous music continues) (rain splattering) Make sure you do, I want him dead, dead! (ominous music continues) (rain splattering) Well, we finally found something you're good at. What do you mean? Well, I was thinking, you're not much of an outlaw, are you? The legendary Dick Turpin. You get caught every time you go out (laughs). I don't write the legends. They just get exaggerated over time. Everyone likes a good story, don't they? Even you. (thunder droning) I prefer the real thing. (rain splattering) (birds chirping) Where did you learn how to do it? What, highway robbery? No, stupid, how to treat a lady? (rain splattering) (thunder droning) I was married once, a long time ago. (rain splattering) I didn't know that. (rain splattering) Remember that story I told you about how I fell in with Jack Jones' gang? Well, the girl I was married to, she worked in the butcher's too. Wasn't long before they had her fencing stolen goods. - What happened? - (rain splattering) Apart from Jones, we all got sentenced to the noose. I managed to escape. She didn't. (rain splattering) (grass rustling) (door squeaking) (footsteps thumping) (rain splattering) (thunder droning) (suspenseful music) - Well. - (Elizabeth gasping) (suspenseful music continues) I can't say I'm totally shocked. Elizabeth, not even married yet, and you've already been unfaithful to me. (suspenseful music continues) What are you doing? I'm saving a life of my fiance, Turpin, from a notorious criminal who's kidnapped her and held her hostage in a dangerously inflammable building. - Inflammable? - (suspenseful music continues) Look at this, all these candles everywhere. Goodness knows what might happen. (suspenseful music continues) (rain splattering) O'Reilly, oil, please. (suspenseful music continues) (oil splashing) Come along, Elizabeth. For God's sake, put on some clothes, you look like a whore. I would sooner stay with Turpin and burn to death than go anywhere with you. (suspenseful music continues) She knows who you are, Jack. - Oh, really? - (suspenseful music continues) Well, perhaps it will be better if you did burn to death. (suspenseful music continues) (rain splattering) O'Reilly, a little bit more oil, please, on these two. (suspenseful music continues) Always ready to fire, O'Reilly. (gun firing) (O'Reilly grunting) (suspenseful music continues) (O'Reilly thumping) (fire roaring) (O'Reilly screaming) Quick, Elizabeth, the door. (suspenseful music continues) (lock rattling) (fire roaring) (suspenseful music continues) I meant go out through it, not lock us in. (suspenseful music continues) (fire roaring) So, this is it, Turpin. (suspenseful music continues) (fire roaring) It's just you and me. (suspenseful music continues) (fire roaring) I have waited a long time for this, Jack. You must have known that sooner or later, one of us would track you down. I did, that's why I've always been prepared. (suspenseful music continues) (fire roaring) (knife whooshing) (Elizabeth gasping) (suspenseful music continues) (fire roaring) (fighters grunting) (suspenseful music continues) (Jack grunting) (suspenseful music continues) (Jack thumping) (fire roaring) - (gentle music) - Why don't you ever do - what I tell you? - I never do what men tell me. But anyway, where would I go? One thing at a time, Elizabeth. Now let's get out of here before the whole place goes up. (gentle music continues) (fire roaring) (dramatic music) (wind howling) (hooves thumping) (horse neighing) (dramatic music continues) (birds chirping) (hooves clomping) (dramatic music continues) (grass rustling) (horse snorting) (dramatic music continues) (hooves clomping) Are you sure your want to do this? - (birds chirping) - What else can I do? I have no income, nowhere to stay. I can't possibly afford to keep Hargreave Hall. (birds chirping) All right, then. Now remember what I said, when the carriage comes around the corner. I know what I'm doing, I've read all the stories. In those stories, everything gets exaggerated. Not everything does. (dramatic music continues) (leaves rustling) (suspenseful music continues) (hooves clomping) [Dick] Stand and deliver. [Elizabeth] Your money or your life.
