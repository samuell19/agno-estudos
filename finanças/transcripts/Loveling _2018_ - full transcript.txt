Let's go! - Let's go! - Run! - Careful, careful. - Watch out for the hole! Go! Go! Let's go guys! Let's go! Let's go to the water! Now I will destroy the soldier city! Throw everything in there, the little ones too. - Can I take the sword? - No. We are going to the game. - And Captain America's shield? - No. - Why not? - How will we cheer for your brother? It’s not opening. - Where? - Here. - Wait, it’s not opening here? - Over here, look. - Do you want a knife? - Yes, get me a knife. Careful! Where is it? Here. Thanks, son. - See if it opens. - It opened! No, it opens here, but not down here. Let's go. - Why is it foggy, mom? - Because it is like this today. Let’s go, 1, 2, 3 and... Got it, Fabiano? Look, your brother did it. Go! - Let’s go, guys! - Crusty! I’m going to say goodbye to Crusty! - Leave Crusty. - Bye, Crusty! Let’s go! Fog! Fog! Sonia, it's Irene. I was a bit late and you weren't here anymore. Where are you? Call me. Kisses. - Mom? - What? Wait, I'm going to call your dad. - What about Fabiano? - We'll call him, hang on. Hi, love. No, I'm coming. Did Sonia call you? No? She's not here, I don't know. Wait. Come on, son! We have to go, we can't wait anymore! Hi. Did you buy the milk? No, I didn't. Sonia told me it was R$8,50. It's R$12,50. - Hi, daddy! - Send daddy a kiss! - Kisses, dad! - We're coming. Let's go, Rodrigo! Ok, we're on our way. We fought fucking hard to reach the finals, if we win this match, we'll make history! Go, go! - Well done, Fernando! - Amazing, son! Good one, Fernando! Stop him, stop him! Fuck! Come on, son! Come on, son! He defended it! What happened? Oh, sister... I'm sorry, ok? Don't worry. Does he know you're here? Of course not. Good, because I got a bit scared of him. We can leave if you want. Stop it. You know that's not what I meant. Let me see that. You should put some ice on it. Putting on makeup won't help. - Is it that bad? - I'll get you some ice. - Can we swap lightsabers? - No! Why? - I don't like pizza. - Do you want cookies? You're not eating your slice if you pick the basil out. I'll take your slice if you pick the basil out. All of that, Klaus? It's too much. I want it. Fernando! What do you mean? Son, please, we're all waiting for you. What do you mean, Jander? Dude, are you serious? I'm so hungry! Do you want a big slice, love? I'll give this one to your sister. The airplane is going to land on dad. You can serve the boys first, I'll eat later. You can have this one, Klaus. You have to eat, Sonia. Brother! Take this! Hey, listen... Son, cut smaller pieces. Let me do it, hang on. You'll eat better if you cut smaller pieces. The olive pizza is so good, are you eating it? It's delicious, my love. - Sit down to eat! - Sit down, my love. - I'm going to sit, love. - Do we have pepperoni? Fernando! Pepperoni is in the oven. - Brother! - Don’t shout! I’ll give you eight thousand bucks if you come here! Guys, guys. I have something to say. I was invited to play handball in Germany. No, wait. What? I was invited to play handball in Germany! I'm serious! I was invited to play in Germany, guys. Mom! Handball in a professional team! - What do you mean? - I'll be a pro! - You have to take me with you! - Yeah, I'm taking you! Handball, dad! What do you mean, Germany? It's not that simple. - What happened? - I don’t know, it won’t shut. Wait, guys, I'm not playing! - No, excuse me. - Don’t do that! Go check the shut-off valve! Fernando, shut the main valve! I'll go. Hold on. My God! Go, Klaus! I’m trying, wait! It’s going to flood the kitchen, hurry! I can't do it! LOVELING It will be expensive. Is there any other way? Yes, we can move to the new house. With what money? There’s none to finish it. - You know there is. - Right, selling the beach house. The realtor said someone is interested. - I don’t want to know about it. - What do you mean? I told you. I don’t want to sell it. We can't afford to have a beach house. Sonia, talk to your sister. She must face reality. - I don’t want to sell it. - There’s no other way. - No, no. - Go through there. There’s a ladder here. You have to understand that. I don’t want to talk about it. But we’ll have to. We just have to bring a pipe from outside, then we can shower, do the laundry, cook... Where are you going, son? I have to go. - I love you. - Me too. - Where are you going? - The guys are celebrating. - What guys? - The guys from the team. - Who will you come back with? - With Jonas. He drinks. I don’t want you riding with him. - Relax. - I won’t relax, I'm serious. Tomorrow we have a meeting with Jander, ok? Yes, I'll go. Listen, Fernando... If this boy drinks, you don’t come back with him. - Relax. - Call me and we'll pick you up. Right, Sonia? We'll pick you up with the van. Give me another kiss. Promise you won’t come back with him if he drinks. - Relax. - Promise me. Bye. Say: “I promise, mom!” Love you, son. BATHROOM MY BEDROOM Irene. Here is your exam. But I haven’t marked it yet, ok? It’s just that there is the trimester graduation, and... - Ok. Can you wait a minute? - Yes. - I’ll mark it now, ok? - Thank you. It's this one. Did I get that one right? This one, yes. We'll take a look at it and get back to you as soon as possible. Is there a deadline for signing it? The sooner the better, because we are in a hurry. - Hi, dear! - How are you? So, we’ll read it and call you. We’ll keep in touch. - Sorry, I have to go... - Are you Jander? This is Jander, dear. - This is my mother, Irene. - I'm a little late, sorry. - Thank you. - Are you leaving already? - He has to go. - We'll keep in touch. I just got the news that I have graduated. - I'm done! I'm done. - Congratulations, mom. Thank you, son! There will be a graduation party and all. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - I wanted to know about the school... - He explained it already. The school is really good. I studied there. I can assure you it's good. Talk to them. I’m sorry, I really have to go. - We’ll keep in touch. - Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Mr. Jander. - I'm sorry I'm late. - It's ok, but we couldn't wait. Look how cool the brochure is. It's all in German, I don't understand a thing. But look at these pictures. The gym... there is nothing like this here in Brazil. We will need to sort out his documents, visa, passport... And we have to emancipate him. Why emancipate? - I must be of legal age to play there. - To travel alone. - You're gonna be of legal age! - They'll send his ticket by e-mail. His flight is in 20 days. - We need to sort this out. - 20 days? - He’s going in 20 days? - Yes. He can't. He’s in the middle of the school year. - He can't lose this year. - No, I'll study there. - But you must speak German. - Everyone speaks English there. They’ll get me a tutor. I'm a fast learner. Not even Germans learn German fast, but you will? - It's not that hard. - Now you’re a genius? - No, but I learn fast. - I thought he was going next year. Then we would have time to organize everything. He can finish school and go next year. Let me tell you something, the Germans are organized. It's the beginning of the season. If I don’t go in 20 days, my future will be ruined! - Don’t exaggerate. - I’m not, it’s true. - What’s the difference? - They won't want me then. They can't wait. It's the beginning of the season. The championship is starting. Don't worry, mom. They're very serious. We’ll read the contract carefully. But I don't speak English. I'll explain it to you. We need to get you a case for the tuba. But it’s expensive. It’s better than carrying it in the middle of the street. It’s dangerous. - What if it falls and breaks? - Yes. - What if it falls and breaks? - He'll be screwed! - Careful! You almost hit her. - I didn’t even come close. Come here, Matheus. Stay close to mommy. The street is full of people. Hold on to the trolley. - Pay attention! - I didn't mean to. Walk in front of us. For God’s sake! Can I speak to the coach, please? The set costs R$50.00. Hi, coach? Just a minute. Hi, it’s Irene, Fernando’s mom. How are you? Coach, who is Jander? He was at the match and said he's your friend. - Sorry, may I interrupt? - One moment. It’s a bit expensive. But it's the best fabric I have. It's the best cotton. You can pay in 30 days. Yes, I'm here. I want the roast beef. I have change. Small change is a real gift! - Thanks. - Thank you. Bye. He said he was your friend, I thought you knew. I was going to ask about it. He's your best player. - The couple's set is R$50, right? - Just a second. Yes, but give him a discount to keep the customer happy. - R$45? - Whatever you decide. - R$45 is a fair price. - Do you know him or not? That's what I wanted to know. He showed us some papers, talked to Klaus. He said he has to be there in 20 days. - I have to go, Sonia. - What happened? I have to hurry to sort something out. Some people are coming to pick up linen sets. You can sell the rest, if you want. - Is everything ok? - I’ll explain it later. - Ok, sis. - Thanks. Bye. Good sales! - I can still play the final. - Why are you here? - I'm here to practice. - Aren’t you going to Germany? - In 20 days only. - So grab your things and leave! - But I can still play. - No, you won't! You’ve learned nothing. Manliness, team spirit... No one is irreplaceable. You're abandoning us! We had a plan for this fucking team! Get your hands off me! Are you crazy? You piece of shit! Stop it, guys. Stop! Stop it! He fucked us! Stop it, Coach! Stop! Let go off me! I'll break his face! Fernando, stop it! Let's go! - What are you doing here? - I came to see you. - Are you all right? - I’m ok, and you? - Are you ok, son? - I'm fine. - Let’s go. - I'll take the boys. - Come here. - Ok, let's go. Come on, son, let's go. Everything's all right. Your brother's fine. I'll take him. Do you need help, Rodrigo? Give me the backpack. I don’t need to explain. This is something else. Do I really need to explain it? I can’t. Give me some time. Give me some time, I will sort this out. Who is going to pay? Oh, you are? You know you won’t. Alan, let's talk some other time. I can't now. One, two, three, go! - I killed you! - No, you didn't! Come here then! Thiago! Son, it's your father. - What? - He wants to talk to you. I’m busy playing! I'll talk later! He doesn’t want to talk! It’s not me, it’s him! Alan, I won’t talk anymore. I can’t, I’m busy. Sister, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the mess. Sonia, I think you should talk to him. No. I have nothing to talk to him about. But I think you should. I can go with you. I can't stand the sight of him! - Who wants orange? - I don’t! You don’t, Fabiano? - I do. - Do you want, Thiago? Do you want an orange, Matheus? Goal! Matheus! In a bit, mom. Careful! Goal! Matheus! - I want it, mom. - Do you want, Rodrigo? Yes. Thiago, take some to Rodrigo. - Go! - I have the bucket. - Bubbles! - Bubbles! Careful with your eyes. Now it's Matheus! Mommy loves you so much Sleep Loveling... How many plane tickets will he have? When will he come back? I don't remember, honey. I'll ask. Klaus, we need to get him a coat. It's better to buy it over there. How long is the trip? I don't know, over 1 hour on the coach to Rio. Then he goes to the airport... - Around 15 hours. - Wow... Look, sister. - Beautiful. - Good, right? - Very modern. - How much is it? Everything over there is R$50. - I’ll take it. - Ok. I'll take this one. Also that swim trunk. The swim trunk is new, I told you. So... let me pay you. Sister, he’s around the corner. - He knows I’m coming, right? - Yes. Tell him we’ll be right over, I just need to pay. Oh, I almost forgot to give you this. It's the invitation to my graduation. You'll graduate, Irene! - Your dream is coming true! - I did it! - Congratulations! - Thanks. I did it! - How beautiful! - You are coming, right? I’m thrilled. I need to dress you two up! You can’t use any old clothes on the day of your graduation. Look at this, Irene. Check the weight. Isn't it wonderful? It's pure glamour! Here, I have something for you too, Sonia. What do you think, Eskimo style or olive like? - Beautiful. We’ll come back. - I’ll keep it for you! Sonia is in a hurry. Let me pay. The coat will be my graduation gift! No way. It’s not even for me. - Is it for your husband? - Fernando. He fits in this already? - He’s a grown man. - Wow. He will play handball in Germany. - Football in Germany? - No, handball, with your hands. Isn't that a foul? As long as it is in Germany, it's all good. It's wonderful. I have a cousin who went to Berlin and never came back. He never came back to Brazil. Berlin is great, a luxury. You think so? I know it’s cold over there. Don't be like this. Everything will be ok. Let me pay you, Sonia's in a hurry. We need to go. Here. The doctor’s prescription. I’m taking medication. I’ve been there twice already, and I’m going to church everyday. I will succeed! Klaus doesn't want to see you. He said that if you showed up he would beat you up. I know, he's right. It was the drugs, not me. I’m not a bad person. You know that. I miss you and Thiago a lot. Alan, what you did was very serious. - You need to give Sonia some time. - I know. If you go near her or lay a finger on my sister or on my nephew again, I’ll call the police. This will never happen again. Good. Otherwise, I will call the police. Give me my keys. I want my keys, I need to go back to my house. Have you found a place to stay? Sonia, please. My keys... I’m not leaving! You have to come back! Don't make a scene! We are here to talk. - She is the one fighting. - You're nervous, keep calm. I tidied up the house for them to return today. - My mother helped. - Your mother went through my stuff? - Sonia, calm down. - Is that it? I have to go. Do you want to stay longer? I want my life back, Sonia. I want my house key back! Stop it! Do I look nice? Let me just... Wait, son. - Do I look pretty? - Yes. Is my lipstick ok? Do I look pretty, Fernando? Your eyelashes are more or less... My lashes? - No, up there. Your eyebrows. - My eyebrows? - Let's go? - I wanna go in. - I'll stay here. - No, Fernando, come. - Who’s coming? - I am! I am! I wanna stay here. Matheus, Fabiano, did you know I used to work here when I was a little older than you? I cleaned this whole house. There was never a single leaf laying out there. - I cleaned the backyard... - Not even a pebble? Not even that... Let me stay outside with the boys. - Son, please, we agreed... - I don’t want to go in. But you will because you promised me. It will be quick. Guys, behave, ok? I don't want anyone being naughty. Here she comes. Smile. - How are you, Mrs. Norma? - Good. This is Rodrigo’s tuba, he is playing at the town band, and we didn’t have time to drop it at home. He is 12, can you believe it? This is Fabiano, say hi! Hi! Do you remember I had twins? Fabiano and Matheus, say hello. And this is Fernando, the eldest. The last time I came here... - He was very little. - Yes, he was little. Anyway, I brought you my graduation invitation. As you can see, I finished high school. I would be happy if you could come. Great. If you could go... I don't think I'll make it. Ok, but if you can... I would be happy. Anything else? No. I came to show you the boys and hand you the invitation. I won't take anymore of your time. On your way out, please turn on the garden sprinklers. Down there, right? Ok, I will. - Bye, Mrs. Norma. - Bye. Mrs. Norma, I almost forgot. I went by Ligia’s shop and got you this. It’s a silk peignoir. Beautiful, I think you'll like it. You're so elegant, so pretty. But that was it, thank you. God bless you. Bye, Mrs. Norma. Let's go, guys. I don't want the boys to meet her! Damn it! You're never going to get this! She did this to herself, she deserves to be alone. Stop it, Klaus. Fernando doesn't even like her. I didn't want the boys to go. I told you a million times! It’s raining! Where are you going? - It doesn’t matter! - Come back, Klaus! Klaus, listen to me! Wait, Klaus! Klaus, listen to me! I used to work for her, ok? - Fernando will work now. - Did she pay you? She paid my dad, it helped my family. She didn’t pay you, she beat you. I was part of the family. I was a child... She was educating me. You were a slave! You didn't work there. She made you clean toilets! Don’t I clean toilets at home too? This is our family! So what? Klaus, stop it! Come back here! Klaus! Listen to me! Under public applause I can’t leave you, leave you, my darling I’ll take you with me Said the murderer under public applause Mom? Of my deep love! Hi! Join the party! Party! Sit down, Rodrigo! There’s popcorn, cookies, you can eat everything. - There is ice cream... - Where is dad? - Where's dad? - What? He went out to get more ice cream. Listen, it's that song you like! If the kids wake up, they can join us! I can’t leave you, leave you, my darling Sit down, Fernando! Sit down. Let's dance! Said the murderer, under public applause I can't... - Don’t you like this song? - I do. That's what I'm listening to. Sit down! Said the murderer under public applause We have to go through a lot of paperwork. The school will send theirs straight to Germany. I have to go to the notary’s office, for the emancipation. You could come and register there as well. I can’t today, I have a lot to do. Are you upset with me, Irene? Thank you! My God, look at this place. What a wonderful, beautiful place. Do you see what I can do here, Irene? This will be the coolest bookshop in town. There's so much potential, I didn't know this place. My God, what an opportunity! Klaus, besides the rent, there’s the down payment, the renovation. Look at the size of this! - It’s cheap, love. - No, Klaus... I’m off. Thank you sir, you can close now. Don’t close yet. Irene, if it’s not here it will have to be somewhere else. What? I mean it. The copy shop is operating at a loss. I became a book consultant. People only come by to ask me about good books. Then they go buy them in a nice bookshop, or online. There’s no way to keep it anymore. Is there no way to save the shop? We have to sell the beach house. I’m not selling it. I don’t even want to talk about it. I'm not interested. We need to talk about it. I'm telling you, we need to sell it. What will we do with the kids on their holiday? Spend a month with them at home? I won’t. - I have to work. - Yes. I have to make money. I have to work. You know I do, Irene. I'll finish our new house, we'll make money. I'll buy beach house in Angra. Why don’t you go ahead and buy an island? A helicopter, a plane, a jet ski... You deserve it all. I would love to give it to you. - If I can’t, your son will. - You know what I deserve? I deserve to earn my own money. Who said those who work have time to make money? Who said that? Who said work ennobles man? Huh, Irene? I don’t have time to listen to your theories. Noblemen said that. Rich people, politicians, businessmen. Work hard and you will succeed. No, no. What? Mr. Sergio, how are you? Are you busy? A Little. Come. - May I? - Sure. I just wanted to know if they have the sheets for me. Yes, they do. The red ones. It's all set. That’s all my client talks about. Hello? Hello? I’ll hang up, I have to work. - It's tough, huh? - Yes. I would also like to invite you to my graduation party. - Your graduation! - I graduated, Mr. Sergio! - How wonderful. - It was hard, but I did it. - At 5 o'clock on the 5th? - Yes, but you can show up a bit later. You told me that when I graduated you would find me a job here. A steady job. Well, that was long time ago. A lot has changed. I sold the factory. - Really, Mr. Sergio? - Really. I won’t have my supplier anymore, such good product. Sells well. They will do the same thing, only they will also pack and sell. - I see. - Understand? The product comes ready from China. - And I’m going to São Paulo. - Miss your family? It’s bad to stay away, I know. But I know they'll open a selection process. - I can get you a test if you want. - I do! - Do you? - Yes, I do. I want a regular job now. The salary is not very good. You'd have set working hours. I'm not sure how you'll manage with your kids. I’ll figure it out. It's important to have a steady income. One month I sell well, the other not as much... I want to be able to plan ahead. He's thirsty. Do you think Flamengo will win? - Rodrigo. - Yes? Are you done? Start doing the dishes then. Why did you point your finger? I will wash this, but each one washes his own dish. - I prepared the whole meal. - I mean what's left. Hey! My bad. Did it spill on you? - My shirt is wet. - Sorry! Fernando... You could give me your spot on the top bunk bed. I haven’t even left yet and you want my bed. But you’re going soon. Leave me the bunk bed! Leave it to me. Seriously. With my dad at home, my mom won’t return. The bunk won’t be yours. You don’t even live here. But I’m living now! Your parents will make up and you'll return home. - I doubt it. - True. If Rodrigo stays on the top bunk, it will fall down and the bottom bunk will break. You'll hit your head and have to go to the hospital. So the bunk bed will break with me. I’m alone looking after you guys. Help me, please. I thought you were looking after these two. After you too, because you're babies. You're going back home, you won't get it. - Dude, I want the bunk bed. - You won’t have it! The house will collapse! No one will have a thing. - Why will the house collapse? - I saw a new crack on the wall. - There's no new crack. - Yes, there is. - You are making it up. - Making it up? I’ll show you. Look! It caused a power cut. The crack cut the power... It may have broken the energy cable. Don't tell them! Do you hear me? - Don't tell them! - Ok, ok. Hi! How are you guys? Sorry. Did I hit you? Take this! What are you doing here? Nothing, we're just talking. - Careful, Irene. - Waiting for me? Is everything ok? Hi Thiago. Are you ok? - Do you need help? - Help me here. Is everything all right with you two? Irene, look at what I found. - What? - What is it, son? - Oh no. - Leave that. It's better not to touch it. It's not a big deal. The house could fall, I read on the internet. - Just needed a bit extra salt. - There had to be a criticism. If you don't succeed at handball, you can be a cook. I will! - The light? - Is it the light bulb? I tried to change the bulb but it wasn't it. I also checked the wiring but found nothing wrong. If it’s not the bulb, it must be the wiring. Well, I checked. It must be something else. - Do you think it got wet? - I don’t think so. Weird. I changed this bulb last week. Aunt Sonia? - Do you know who called? - Who? Uncle Alan called saying he misses Thiago. He’s lying. He never called. It’s true! - He didn't call. - Look at the call log. - It was a secret, dude! - This isn't what we agreed... - Are you gonna call him? - Yes, I’ll call him now. - You are nervous. - It gives me the courage. Sonia, I know you are there! Let's go play video-game in the bedroom. Let's go. - Open the door! - Come, Fernando. Let's play. I just want to make everything right again. You know I'm clean. - Open the door! - Stop it, stop! Your son is scared of you. Honey, I’m clean. I didn’t come to cause trouble. I came to bring you some money. I got a job. I don’t want any money. I just want to go home. That’s all I want. Find a place to stay. Stop coming after me! I know I did everything wrong. I'll do whatever you want. I want to see my son. - Here. - Perfect. Now we only need to notarize our signatures, right? Yes. Then we send it to our head office and the emancipation is ready in 7 working days. - That long? - It's quick. We can’t wait that long, sir. Really, we can't wait. We have to go to the Federal Police in two days, and without the passport we can’t issue the visa, and he can’t sign the contract. He can't even board. I understand, but that’s the waiting time. Did you buy today's paper? Take a look. - It’s him. He’s going to Germany. - I’m going to play handball. Great. Congratulations. It’s a very good opportunity. Please, help us, sir. But that’s the procedure. See, mom? You delayed coming here. You told me it could be done right away... I read online that it was on the same day. Here we can do it immediately. If you had come earlier, we could have sent it today which would mean 6 days... Now it’s 2 days to get there, and the official over there has a serious health problem. The poor guy is not showing up for work. Then it’s 2 more days to get it signed, stamped and returned to us. Their stamp is what matters. - You can’t help us? - Come on... See, son? Ask them to delay things a bit. No, it can’t be delayed! - I can’t believe this! - Calm down... Son? Teenagers, right? He's nervous. That's it. This is Brazil. Too much red tape. It's gonna be tough. Are you happy, mom? Oh, Fernando. It’s such a shame to say that. - He looks like me, right? - Yes, he does. Do you only have him? - No, I have four. - Four? He is the eldest, I have three others. I went for the third one and I had twins. There's no horn, right? How can Sonia drive without a horn? She shouts. I'll try to fix it for her. You know how to fix it? Speed bump! I'll get it fixed. - Now you saw. - This one was big. - Honey, is it really here? - Yes. - Is it that way? - Yeah, come here. This is very nice, honey. - It's really abandoned. - Look. The city will build a new road, get rid of the trees. - They'll bring back the ski lift. - Wow. It will even snow here. But you will have to renovate everything? No, no. The Mayor's office... The government will put in the money. We only contribute a little. - I see. - You see? You want to build a bookshop up here? No, my angel. No one buys books anymore. What are you going to do? I don't get it. We're going to sell the view. Postcards... Sandwiches... - I see. - See? Do we have money for this, Klaus? We have a good offer on the beach house. It's just up to us to close the deal. What do you think? I don't know, Klaus, I'm worried this will be just like when you decided to promote college parties. - We lost a lot of money. - Look at this view. Everyone will want to come here. And you know what the Mayor's office told me? The guided tour will go by Santos Dumont's house, the Imperial Museum and then here. - Really? - Yes! - So it will be part of the tour. - Totally! And how wonderful is this place? People can come for lunch, snack, happy hour. They'll come for drinks. Is our money enough if we sell the beach house? It's enough if we sell our beach house. We can finish our house, put some money here, and there will still be some left. Really? Think about it. It will be a success. Look at this, my angel. I'm so happy about this. I think it will be a turning point in our lives. It will be good for us. You are crazy, aren't you? Crazy. I love you. I wanna know what we're doing and how long it will take. He can start... As soon as we arrive at the beach house, Klaus will get the money and everything will be settled. They'll deposit straight into our account. You can start, we will have the money. I just want to understand the project. Irene is worried about some things she wants to discuss with you. I want to know how long it will take. One month, 40 days... - It's too long. - But if he says so... But you could move in while we do the details. I don’t want the children around the construction. Irene wants it done first. Is this right, Mr. Juarez? See if you follow me. - There are four bedrooms. - Yes. One, two, three bedrooms, a bathroom, a small balcony. Isn’t this bathroom in the wrong place? The toilet behind the door, Mr. Juarez? - It's behind the door? - Yes it is. Can’t we move the toilet over there? - Yes, we can. - The toilet will be here, the sink here. It's better. What about upstairs? Can we finish it cheap? - This is her dream. - Upstairs will be fancy. Her walk-in closet... Here will be the master bedroom, the closet, the bathroom, the bathtub... - And the big terrace. - The big terrace. Guys, I was thinking. Why don’t you get rid of my room and build yours here? Get rid of the third floor, it will be cheaper and faster. Don’t you need to finish it fast? No, Mr. Juarez will build one bedroom each. There’s no need. I'm leaving in 10 days. For when you come on holiday or when you return. I’m not coming back. But I want one bedroom for each son. What if it doesn’t work out and you have to come back? What are you talking about? - It's a place for you to sleep. - She said it won't work for me. I didn’t say that. Fernando, this is my house and each son of mine will have one bedroom. When you have your own house... I’m just trying to help, why are you like this? Your mother didn’t mean any harm. Did I ask you? Mind your own business! Don’t talk to your aunt like that! How rude! He’s just nervous. I’m sorry, Mr. Juarez. What do we do in front of the house? - A lawn? - Yes, a lawn. It's good, because in the future I want to grow a vegetable garden for the kids. Have some nice things to eat. Some tomatoes. - It’s a good space. - It would be good. But we can do it later on. - Let's go? - Let's go. It's almost time! Felipe França. Is it me now? Irene Ventura Santi. Stop it, Sonia. I don’t want to cry. I’m so proud of you. I’m also very proud of you. You graduated. You’re right, sister, always moving forward. Always moving forward. Congratulations! You look beautiful, congratulations. I’m leaving, my darlings. My sweetheart is restless. Congratulations. A kiss, my angel. - You two look so beautiful. - I will return it tomorrow. As you wish. Enjoy, take a shower with it. Let me take a picture of you two, you look so beautiful. With or without the snack? With the snack. - Hold the diploma. - Snacks on the plate. Smile! Wait... Wait... - I'm serious, come on. - Wait. Girls, I'm waiting here. Come on, Irene. That’s it. Beautiful! - No! - Wait. - Cookies! - You won't have cookies now. - Here goes the food. - Cookies! I'll do the airplane that you like. No, that’s for babies. It’s not for babies. Look, the plane is coming. It’s for babies. - Do you want to be grounded? - No. You will be if you don’t eat. I won’t eat and I won’t be grounded. - You doubt me? - Yeah. - Really? - Yeah. I’ll take away the tablet, the TV and the video game. - Will you take a chance? - It's mom who decides. Eat it. What do you think about the new boy, Igor? Can he handle it? He's ok, but we can't compare him to you. You're gonna pick up chicks in German, man! - I'm gonna miss you guys. - Thanks, man. If you need money... He always says the same thing. What's up sir? - It was expensive, but I got it. - You did it? Check to see if it's all right. - Are you sure it's all done? - I think so. - Is it ok? - Wait. I'll get a beer. Two beers, please. Thanks. Thank you, dad. Don't mention it, son. It comes a time when everything works out, right? Have you realized things always work out for us? Guys? Are you still up, son? Where’s Fernando? - He’s not home yet. - Are you not sleepy, my love? - Turn off the TV. - We are watching a show. But Fabiano should be asleep already. - He didn’t want to go. - Did you behave? Your brother feels hot. Is he feverish? - No, he's normal. - Enough TV! Didn’t you notice your brother has a fever? - He doesn’t have a fever. - Darling, did you eat? - Hi love. Did he eat? - He did. Turn off the TV, Rodrigo! I’m talking to you! He ate just a bit, so I gave him cookies... You gave him cookies? You ate cookies, son? Come here, my love. I asked for one simple thing. You should have called me if anything happened. Look at your brother, he is clearly not well. I was nearby, Rodrigo. I could have come earlier. - I didn’t want to disturb you. - So don’t, move away! You could have called me. I was nearby! We agreed on something very simple, but you can’t do it. You didn’t even give them a bath. You didn't feed them, showered them... - I tried! - Shut up, Rodrigo! Sorry, my love. - I made dinner... - Keep quiet! Klaus, I’m trying to reach you, but you don't pick up. Where are you? Shit! Shit! Shit! - What's going on? - Mom? - Irene, what are you doing? - Where were you two? Where were you two? Sorting out the emancipation. The emancipation? I can smell beer on both of you. - We were celebrating. - Celebrating? Didn’t I tell you I was going to be late today? Rodrigo was alone with the little ones! Fabiano has a fever of 103F! Look at this mess! - And you were celebrating. - You're going to scare them. That's right! It's scary! Fernando only cares about his life. Your brother is ill! Damn it, Klaus! I'm alone, I can't handle it anymore. I’m very tired, Klaus. I can't do everything by myself. I can't do it. I'm very tired. I'm very tired, Klaus, I can't do everything by myself. I can’t. We have to give Fabiano the medication. Fifteen drops, ok? So you train them as well? I thought you only travelled scouting. - Do I have to sign every page? - No it's ok, you're done. Let me see that. - I signed it here. - Give him the envelope, son. Thanks, Fernando. - Check if everything is ok. - Everything is ok. Congratulations. Congratulations, family. Do you need paper, pens, these things at the club? - We are selling it all very cheap. - Well thought. You can both take it with you. We are closing down the store. We have a lot of paper. - Me, buy paper? - Pens, pencils... - For your office. - It’s not possible. - Why? - He must be full of stuff. - You could also take some. - But I’m also full of stuff. You could help your father. We can give you a discount. Yes, I’ll give you a discount. - That's not how it goes... - You don't want it? - Are you taking these balls? - Yes. So careful not to lose them. Are you taking them? Excuse me, Rodrigo. Give it to me. Thiago, give me the ball. - Is this jacket yours? - Yes, it was. Guys, stop it! You're gonna get hurt. - It doesn't fit me anymore. - No? You've grown so much, loveling! Rodrigo, see if it fits you. It doesn't fit your brother anymore. It's gonna be small on him! I have a dinosaur gun! See if the jacket fits you. Try it on. - Where's the racket? - Matheus. Fabiano, are you taking this? Will you take this cool robot? I’m taking my knee pad and... Are you taking the armadillo? Will you carry it or should I pack it? Here, Fernando, the swim trunk I bought you. Is it second-hand? It's from Ligia's shop, but it’s new. Here, have a look. Someone bought and didn’t want it anymore. Let’s go or we’ll get stuck in traffic. - It doesn’t fit. Take it off. - It's a speedo, mom. It doesn’t fit him? Then it should fit Thiago. Help him, he’s stuck. - Fernando, it's not a speedo. - I’m definitely not wearing that! The color is so beautiful. Rodrigo, try it on. It’s brand new. - Mom, it’s a speedo. - You two are unbearable! Your father will use it then. - You need a jacket, son. - I don’t want it. Niña! Sonia. Is there room for me on this trip? Stop joking. Relax, I’m kidding. I want to talk to Thiago. I brought your house key. I’m going to a clinic. Good. Thiago! - Hi, Alan. - Hi, Irene. - How are you? - Fine. - Sonia, we are leaving already, ok? - Ok. - Everything is packed. - Ok. Sonia, I tidied up the whole house. You'll see how it is. I want to talk to Thiago. I need to talk to him. Give me the key. You look beautiful. Ok, give me the key, come on. - I want a kiss. - What? - Give me a kiss. - Stop it. - You are my wife... - Stop it. Stop it. Alan, stop! Irene! Get off me! Let go off my sister! - Let her go, I told you! - Are you going to hit me? This is my house. I'll call the police! I'll put you in jail! - Disappear from here! - I want to see my son. - I have my rights! - You are going to jail! Leave! Stop it. Are you mad? This is my house! I want to see my son! - Don’t yell like that! Don’t shout! - Son! - You're scaring your son! - Thiago, your father's here! - Thiago, your father's here! - You're in my house! Are you crazy? Stop it! - Thiago! - Hold him, Rodrigo! - Rodrigo! - I'm holding him! Hold him back! Don’t let him go in! - Get off! - Pull him back! It's good when it's this calm. Do you wanna go back? - It’s nice, right? - Yeah. - Are you cold? - A little. Ice pops! There we go! Throw the float over here. Son, get the alligator. Mom, catch it! I saved the alligator! Who wants ice pop? I do! This house only brought us joy. I’ll be there soon. Everything will work out. Bye. Such a nice breeze, isn’t it? The sun is not out, but the breeze is nice. Look at him, Klaus. He’s so big. In 2 years, he’ll be someone else. - No. - Of course he will. In 2 years he won’t recognize us and we won’t recognize him. We can fly over to visit him. - Fly, Klaus? - Yes. The ski track will be a success, we’ll make money. - I’m telling you. - Ok, I trust you. I just have to close the deal. The money will kick in... You're just like your dad. Always thinking about buying stuff. What would you do with this plot of land? I would open an all-you-can-eat barbecue place! Shame on you! What are you eating? Stop eating. I don’t want it. I told you, son, you're eating too much. It’s nice here. It’s so hot out there. Get that pudding. Give me the spoon. Mom said we shouldn’t eat the pudding. What’s the problem? Are you gonna tell her? It looks good. - Let me eat some. - No, I’ll have just a little. - I think it's Klaus. - Go. I'll finish it here. What happened? Tell me, love. What happened? - It didn’t work out. - What do you mean? They brought the price down. They wanted to pay in many installments. Wasn’t the deal closed? Everything is for sale now. Too many robberies. I don’t know what to do. Calm down, we’ll figure something out. - I'm sorry. - Calm down. We’ll figure it out. - I'm sorry. - We’ll sell it. We can lower the price a little. We’ll put up sign. I’ll talk to the neighbours. We’ll manage to sell it. Take it easy, it will be ok. Oh, darling, it will be ok. One fell down. Get it! Sonia, come see! Fabiano, catch one! Don’t let them escape! Come, Matheus and Rodrigo! Matheus! Fabiano, next to you! Right! It's raining! Oh no, it's raining again. So much rain. FOR SALE What movie is this? - That one with that guy. - I've seen it! - No spoilers! - I'll tell you what happens! Did you know Ligia has been to Germany? Cool. But I heard on the radio... there are terrorist attacks all the time. - It’s not all the time. - I heard it on the radio. Mom, there's danger everywhere. I know. But apparently they don’t like foreigners. Another lie. They will like me. They will? It's because you are beautiful. - With those little cheeks. - Stop it. They'll squeeze your cheeks, your little nose, and they will like you. I wanted to go to Rodrigo’s parade on Tuesday. But you are going, right? Everyone is. No, I’m not. - What do you mean? - Because my flight is earlier. - It’s afterwards, isn’t it? - No, it's a very early flight. - You didn't tell me that. - I did! You told me it was after the parade. You must have told your father, your brother, but not me. Seriously, I told you. So we have to start packing now. - The day is over. - Why? What do you mean? We're leaving tomorrow, right? So we need to pack now. Sonia! Let’s go, we have to start packing! - We won’t have enough time. - Get up, let’s go! - Calm down. - No, Fernando, get up. I'm taking this as well. Let’s go, we need to organize things. Come on, son, help me. Sonia! What’s going on, Irene? I’m packing things here, otherwise we won’t have enough time. - Why? - Because we leave tomorrow. If we don’t start now, we won’t have time. We have to pack every single thing. Irene, calm down. Ask at the store if they have boxes to pack the pans. This is a great pan, we'll take it. See if they have a big box for all of this. Let’s go, Sonia. We can’t waste time. Fernando, I can’t believe you are still there! Come help! Gather everything and put it there! I’m leaving nothing behind. There's so much stuff in here. I’m not leaving anything. I’ll take it all. I'm taking this as well. There are games, toys, a ball... Is this staying? Of course not. Look at this beauty, we can use it at home. - Get up, I want to take this chair. - This one? Get the fuck up! I’m talking to you! Move, Fernando! This is the chair where I breastfed you. Fernando always liked to be fed here. Rodrigo, Matheus, and Fabiano didn't. Only Fernando liked it. He suckled like a calf on this chair. It had to be here. I’m taking the chair. Sonia, help me. Help me, Sonia! We can’t waste time. Wow, it's heavy. Done. We are taking this too. I’m taking all these things as well. I’ll use it at the new house. I'll take these too. Sister! Wait! - Did you hurt yourself? - It’s bleeding! My God, Fernando! Help! She cut herself. Easy! Don't take your hand off. Get a clean cloth! We're leaving. Let's go! Let's go? Let's go, guys. - Say goodbye to the house. - Bye! Do you want to help, Fabiano? Thanks, son. - Klaus, please take this. - Of course. That’s it, son, thanks. This way. Come, son. There we go. It's here. Thanks, my son. He is the only one helping. Let's go, guys! Fernando. Everything ok, Mr. Juarez? - My hand is hurting. - Then stop, my love. - Go play, let mommy do it. - But I want to help, mom. Ok, then, help. I'll give it to you. Let me do it. Let me just take this spoon... Where's that little spoon? Oh, it's here. Here, love, take it. Sonia, please pass it to him. Who else wants some? Fernando? Rodrigo, all flavors. What are you doing here? I’m getting some things that are still here. You left this here. Isn’t it yours? Yes. But it’s old. You're not taking it? Leave it then. - Throw it away. - I'll give it to your brother. - Careful, son. Come here. - You have to go. Let's go! The backpack! Son, call us as soon as you get there. - I love you. - Take care. Wear your jacket. - Don’t speed, driver! - Bye! - Let’s run with him. - Bye! Come on. Bye, son! Bye, son! Let’s go, guys! Bye, Fernando! Bye, Fernando! Bye, son! Irene, whose shirt is that? It's Fernando’s. Sister, look who's coming.
