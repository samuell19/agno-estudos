(orchestral music) (Latin jazz music) - Forgive me for staring, Miss um-- - Fox, Samantha Fox. - MacKenzie Portman here. I couldn't help but notice your strong interest in the match, do you have a favorite? - (chuckling) The red. The team in the blood-red shirts will win. Which do you favor, Mr. Portman? - Please, call me MacKenzie. The white, I'm afraid; shall we indulge in a small wager? - Oh, I never bet on anything except a sure thing. It makes life less complicated. - Well put, tell me, does your fondness for tennis extend to other sports? - That all depends on the game, and the players involved. What did you have in mind? - Nothing quite so ordinary as tennis. I have, if I may say so, a rather unique collection of medieval sporting devices, which I believe might appeal to you. Shall we say tonight at 10? - I'm sorry, but tonight is out of the question. - Oh, well, tomorrow night? Same time? My address is in the book. I promise you will not be disappointed. - I'm sure I won't, MacKenzie, you're a very persuasive man. I certainly hope we'll be alone. - Absolutely. I wouldn't dream of sharing you with anybody. There is one thing, would you mind wearing black? - That sounds rather ominous. (whip cracking) (MacKenzie laughs) Excellent, MacKenzie, just excellent. - Would you care to try? - You know, MacKenzie, you were born about 400 years too late. - Yes, you're absolutely right, of course. Except I've managed to adjust myself to the 20th century. With a little help, mind you. (whip cracks feebly) Uh huh. (Mackenzie chuckling) No no no no no no no no, let me show you. Take a firm grip, and then one-two and lash out! One two! (whip cracks loudly) - Oh, this is fun. - On form. - Say, you really are a good teacher. - Lash out! - Am I doing it right? - Yes, perfectly. (MacKenzie clears throat) Um, now you must let me show you my uh piece de resistance. Come. (soft music) - Why MacKenzie, you did have an ulterior motive for inviting me here; medieval sports, my eye. And I suppose this is the playing field. Well, don't just stand there. You know I had my reasons for coming. I can guess what these are for. Really, MacKenzie, did you think I'd be that difficult? - (chuckling) Very clever, Samantha. If I say yes, it's an insult to my irresistibility. If I say no, you'd be entitled to slap my face. - Oh, I'd never do that, but I might use your whip. (groovy music) ♪ Ah ah - More. More! Harder! Thongs, darling. First the maid must bind the lord with the thongs. - Are you sure you want me to do that? ♪ La la la la - I was just teasing. Let me help you. (soft music) Let's see what this will do. (mechanism clatters) (Mackenzie groans) (sultry music) (soft music) Would my lord like a most unusual surprise from his maid? Close your eyes. Don't peek! Now keep your eyes closed. (chuckling) There, are your eyes closed? - Uh huh. - Oh, good. You're gonna love this surprise. (dramatic music) (MacKenzie laughing) - [MacKenzie] What are you doing? What is it? What are you doing, Samantha? - How's that, Mr. Portman? - What is this? - Medieval enough for your tastes? - Take this off at once, don't be ridiculous. Take this thing off me! (yelling) (muttering) Get me out of here! Take it off, Samantha, what are you doing to me? This is not funny any- (wheezing) Samantha, I can't get any air. Please let me out, I beg of you. Take this off, do you hear me? Take it off this instant. (wheezing) Please, Samantha, take this off. (wheezing) (suspenseful music) Samantha. Samantha. (moaning) (wheezing) (Domingo sighs) (knocking at door) - Come on in, Sanchez. - Don't tell me, Domingo, don't tell me. You knew it was me at the door just by looking at your watch. I've been meaning to change my routine for a couple of weeks, I guess now I'll have to. - The prelims on the Portman case? The papers are playing it for all it's worth. Torture killing, Manila's Marquis de Sade. What have you got? - Not much, it's a strange one, Dom, no signs of a break-in. And the guy had a pretty sophisticated alarm system. Portman's 16th-century torture room was complete with very modern hor d'oeuvres and champagne. The cook prepared them before she left. - Sounds like an invited guest, go on. - That's all, Dom. No prints, no cigarettes, no nothing. - So on top of being an invited guest, also pro. What are you checking? - Girls, mostly, he had a book this thick. - Don't waste your time. Anybody this smooth wouldn't leave anything as obvious as a number in a book. - Dom, didn't the DA tell us the treasury boys were onto Portman? - That could figure, 'cause the one thing we don't know for sure is whether Portman was iced by a contract pro or whether he picked a kook for a playmate. - A pro, Dom; no kook gets that lucky. But so much for what we don't know. I wasn't aware we knew anything. - Oh yes we do, we know he was killed by an invited guest who came specifically, or so he thought, to indulge his sexual perversions. We also know MacKenzie Portman was killed by someone he'd just met, and that someone was a woman. I'll bet a month's pay she is an absolute knockout. (church organ music) (birds twittering) (church organ music) - There are three plums to be plucked. You shall find photographs and all pertinent details contained in this map. Since this will be our only contact, might I suggest you peruse the contents? - That won't be necessary, because I'm afraid it doesn't contain all the details. If that were the case, you'd have no need of me. We're both sophisticates, Miss Chao. We abhor anything as commonplace as a gunshot. I'll take what you've given me and find the key to disposing of these people without disturbing so much as a (chuckling) speck of dust. - I underestimate you again. - My fee. - As you instructed, and in German marks. You understand, of course, this is a package contract. No final disposition of your fee till all three are dead. Good. I might also add that my people will be most anxiously awaiting news that your labors have borne fruit. - If I am to pluck plums, I cannot also be expected to grow fruit. In other words, don't rush me, Lee Wa. - She's a member of the club, then. - Uh huh, her name is Samantha Fox. (telephone ringing) - Hello? Hello, Strowitzer, how's my favorite stockbroker? Yes, I said sell. We're doing fine, you just keep on worrying and I'll keep on taking the risk. That's my side of the broker's table. By the way, $150,000 will be deposited in my Zurich account in the next couple of days. Disburse it in the usual way. My best to Maria, Helene, and the grandchildren. Au revoir, (speaking in foreign language). (birds twittering) - Miss Burroughs, may I please ask to see your press credentials? - I suppose this is necessary because of Mr. Stockwell's art collection? - That is quite correct; this way please, Miss Burroughs. Miss Melinda Burroughs, sir. The lady from-- - Yes, I know. Malayan Arts Magazine, I subscribe. A pleasure to meet you, Miss Boroughs. - Likewise, Mr. Stockwell. It's wonderful to hear you're a subscriber. Shall we discuss your renewal? The circulation's dropped the past year. - (chuckling) I can see that it's going to be an interesting interview and possibly a bit rambunctious. How would you like to go about it? Interview first and pictures later, perhaps? - If you don't mind, I'd prefer to take the pictures now. The light is absolutely perfect. That is, if you're not afraid of me interviewing you in the dark. - It is you who should be afraid of the dark. You can leave your tape recorder here, if you'd like. Take your camera and I'll show you the Stockwell collection. (horn honking) - Ah, Sanchez, I thought I might find you here. - You mean you knew you would. - Well, knowing your routine comes in handy once in a while. Now, this is one Samantha Fox. - Appropriate name, Fox I mean. - Yeah, well, but-- - No order, my boss. (speaking in foreign language) - That's why he's stayed at 32; I'm going 44 and still climbing. (police whistle shrills) - Run a make on that for the Miami PD. - Got something, Dom? - I don't know, well, oh yeah, she lives on a yacht tied up off the marina. Get somebody on board to check it out. Shouldn't be difficult, no crew, only her. - Warrant or what? - No warrant, and not one of our boys, either. - Private? - You've got the picture. - Tell me, Melinda. What is your opinion of the pre-dynastic Tahitian sand sculptures discovered by the Coxwell expedition? - You mean the expedition financed in 1964 by the Ramos Foundation, a philanthropic division of Stockwell International? Frankly, it was a waste of time. - (laughing) Melinda, you're the most honest person I've encountered since my second wife. You must come and visit me again sometime. I've enjoyed myself immensely. - So have I; you know, Justin, an old friend of my father's, a lovely old Chinese man with a long white beard, used to tell me that the sadness which accompanies the end of an enjoyable experience can be overcome, by imagining that the best is yet to come. Isn't that a beautiful thought? (camera clicks) (slide projector clicks) (splashing) (suspenseful zither music) (dramatic music) (Samantha exclaiming) (blows thudding) (exclaiming) Hee-yah! (weapons whooshing) (suspenseful music) (exclaiming) (weapons clacking) Hee-yah! (diver yelling) (wind chimes tinkling) - Lady Burroughs, I always thought when the pleasure of drinking in the beauty had been denied a smile though for so many years. - Lu Chang, you have aged with a dignity afforded to few men. I am happy to see you, very happy. - I have been studying the problem ever since we talked on the telephone. It pose the question: Does the most gently falling leaf not leave some moderate impression on the ground upon which it falls? Indeed, it does. But only the ground can feel the pain. The naked eye or the most powerful magnifier can detect nothing. I have found the solution to your problem. - How did you find it, Lu Chang? - The past, all answers lie in past. The future holds only more questions. - You are too modest. You held me as a child, and you told me things. You once told me that to know the past is to hold the key to the future. - Did I ever tell you that the negatives of the past cannot be paid for with a song of the crow but with the song of the nightingale? - (chuckles) You're a wonderful old man, Lu Chang. And I love you. Take as much as you need, to feed the birds. - I have three sons, I never hurt-ed them. I was never in need of one. - Samantha Fox, age 27, early childhood, educated in New England and Switzerland. Parents died when she was 15. Inherited and liquidated the family estate. Net worth estimated in excess of three million. Maintains condominium here, travels extensively, no known record or underworld affiliation. - Join the poor people now. - Good night. Who in the hell is that new maid? Where's Pina? - The agency called and said Pina was sick. This woman was sent as a substitute. I instructed her fully as to her duties. Is there something I can do, sir? - Oh, never mind. But dammit, you call that agency in the morning and chew their ass out. - Yes, sir. - Does she know about my bath? - Yes, Mr. Stockwell, I showed her everything. Good night, sir. (speaking in foreign language) - Don't look so goddamned shocked. I'm sure you've been called worse. Now get me a towel. (classical music) (speaking in foreign language) you stupid little whore. Didn't the butler warn you not to touch me? Finish drawing the bath. First the salts; the powders come later. Champagne. (stereo clicks off) - I know you speak perfect English, Justin, but you've got to learn some nicer words in Tagalog. (ominous music) When I interviewed you the other day, you said the only mysteries you liked were the ones you could solve. Let me help you out. You're sitting here like this simply because someone called for a contract on you. I don't know who, (chuckling) and frankly I don't care. As to why you can't move or speak, I could say that a little Chinese cat's got your tongue. Actually, you're in the grip of an ancient paralytic which vanishes, as they say, without a trace. There, I think that clears just about everything up for you. - Morning, Domingo, sorry to wake you up so early. - Well, that's the first lie of the day. What does it look like to you, Doctor? - The man drowned. There is no sign he had a heart attack first. But I'll know more after completing the autopsy. From what I could tell, there were absolutely no indications that he was physically assaulted in any way. But I am sure you think it's more than that. - Okay, give me the bad news. - Unless the autopsy comes up with a heart attack or something else that points to natural causes, I'd say we have another hell of a hit on our hands. There was one other thing, they found traces of paralysis. But the coroner told me they were totally compatible with death by drowning. - Find the the coroner and tell him to rerun the tests for poisons and any other foreign matters. Also tell him I want Stockwell's body to be cheeked and double checked; anything else? - Everything checks out except this magazine writer. According to the butler, she was a tall blonde, slim, wore her hair rolled up tight. Ah yes, she wore horn-rimmed glasses. - So? - Well, there's a Melinda Burroughs on staff at Malayan Arts, but I'll be damned she fits that description. (guests chattering) (soft jazz music) (speaking faintly) - Therefore we'll eat, and drink. (guests chattering) (soft jazz music) (speaking in foreign language) - Police, excuse me, gentlemen. I couldn't think of any other way to painlessly extract you from the wolf pack. (laughing) - That's all right, I was telling them I just got out of prison for jewel robbery. You came along and made it totally believable. I'm Samantha, Samantha Fox. What's your name? - Domingo De La Torres. And the badge is real, I'm the chief of detectives for the Manila Police Department. - De La Torres. Oh, this afternoon's paper. You're working on the Portman and Stockwell killings. And if I remember correctly, a reporter asked you some questions and your comment was no comment. - No comment. Feel like taking a walk through the gardens? It sure as hell beats necking out here. - Why not? As long as you promise if you rape me, you'll work the case. - It's a promise. - You were pretty damn polite out in the garden. What's the problem, Chief, all wind-up and no delivery? - No, that's not it; you might find this hard to swallow, but when I was a little kid, my mother would take a strap to me every time I came home with dirty clothes. As a result, when I grew up, I never felt comfortable in the bushes. - Hmm. I can understand. why you bastard, you snowed me. - And you just came out of prison on a jewelry rap? (Samantha laughs) (insects chirring) - [Samantha] Thank you. - Excuse me, please. Perhaps the lady would allow me to do a quick sketch. - I don't think she could sit still long enough. Some other time, thanks. - It's for charity, Mister. It will just take a couple of minutes. - Okay, you talked me into it. It'll make a nice souvenir, you like souvenirs, don't you? (soft music) (insects chirring) You have made her too beautiful. She's difficult enough as it is. Do me a favor, throw in a pair of glasses. Horn-rimmed glasses. That's it, great; now, one other thing. Make her hair look like she's afraid to have a good time. You know what I mean, severe, like a librarian. A bun or something like that. Thank you. - Point for you. That makes us even. That private dick you sent to case my boat should be home by now. I left him in a dinghy with a set of oars, just beyond the 20-mile limit. (gunshots booming) You're a fine shot, Chief. This hunting trip was a great idea. Lately I have been feeling damned cooped up in the city. - So far it's been more of a horseback ride than a hunt. How 'bout a little target practice to warm up? - Sure, why not? (gunshots booming) - I doubt our wild boar would prove much of a challenge for you. - No animal ever does. It's much more of a turn-on to watch something die slowly. Even then, the greater the distance, the less the fun. Come on, let's go back to Manila and have some supper. I'm really famished. (clicks tongue to horse) (hoofbeats echoing) (Domingo clicks tongue) (horn honking) Oh, the dinner was really fantastic. - [Domingo] I've been there too much. And it's nice we have a little fox to accompany. - [Samantha] All right, I guess I'll get home, it's dark. (dog barking) (orchestral music) (horns honking) - My car is just down here. - No trouble, just give your money. - No money and no trouble either; get out of my way. (suspenseful music) (exclaiming) (blows thudding) (exclaiming) (clattering) (zither music) (comical music) (soft music) Nice of you to stand there smoking while I took on three of them. Why didn't you move in sooner? - Well you were doing fine, until that little goon came along with the 45. Besides, you're the man, and a man usually takes the lead, doesn't he? My hero, come on darlin', I'll drive you home and take care of those little cuts. - Little cuts? I'm bleeding like a stuck pig. - (chuckling) Poor baby. ♪ Lips like satin ♪ Eyes of crystal blue ♪ Her skin's like a rose ♪ Her kiss entrances you ♪ She's a woman ♪ Filled with mystery ♪ She knows how to love ♪ So sexy, warm, and free ♪ Lady Samantha ♪ He fell in love with you ♪ Can't ever say goodbye ♪ He's so in love with you ♪ Lady Samantha ♪ Oh so lovely ♪ Full of spice and charms ♪ He needs you to stay ♪ Forever in his arms ♪ Lady Samantha ♪ He fell in love with you ♪ Can't ever say goodbye ♪ He's so in love ♪ With you ♪ Lady Samantha ♪ Lady Samantha - Morning, Dom; hard night? Couple of things you might find interesting. Coroner's office sent final results of second autopsy. It's a tough one, it'll read pretty much like the first. - Go on. - The stain on that towel is make-up, dark brown. - Theatrical? - Negative, a cheap brand, available in just about any cosmetic store. Dom, do you remember the strands of material the boys found in the drain of the Jacuzzi? They came from Stockwell's bathtub. - Come on, let's go. How deep do you suppose that Jacuzzi is when he stands on it? - I'd say about two and a half feet, three feet, not much more. - That sounds right. Then the killer would have had to overpower Stockwell first, or incapacitate him in some way before stuffing the drain with towels. - Meaning what? - The point of stuffing the drain was to make the water level rise enough to drown him. Afterwards, the towels were removed to make it look accidental. Did Stockwell's butler have a look at that sketch? - Yes, he made a positive identification. It's that girl who's posing as Melinda Burroughs. - And now, 10 years later, Madame Ruanda has made millions with her cosmetological clinic and health spa, which has become a mecca for women in search of renewed beauty and physical well being. Tonight we have invited Madame Ruanda to demonstrate a new technique, which she claims actually reverses the aging process of the skin. Ladies and gentlemen, Madame Ruanda. - [Person] And one, two, three, four, and one. (whistle blows) And one, two, three, four, and five. One two three four five six seven eight. One two three four five six seven eight. One two three four. Five six seven eight. (Ruanda snaps fingers) One two three four five six seven eight. - Well now, my girlfriends. Are the techniques as rewarding, spiritually and physically, as I said they would be? - [All But Samantha] Yes, Madame Ruanda. - Splendid, girls, splendid. Give it up, Madame R is very proud of your progress. - [People] One two three four five six seven eight. One two three four five six seven eight. (woman screaming) (smacks resounding) (woman sobbing) (woman screaming) (man laughing) (woman screaming) (knocking at door) (insects chirring) - Come in, it's not locked. - Madame Ruanda would like you to join her for a drink in her cottage. She apologizes for the rather late invitation. - That's all right, I understand. - Miss Van Houten, how nice of you to come. Thank you, Jeffrey, that's all for tonight. You may return to Number 22 and finish that little situation. Please, come in and make yourself comfortable. I will propose a little toast. To your renewed vitality and spiritual well being, Solvang Van Houten. Although the operation was successful, that pain, oh, that pain, it comes and goes all the time. That's why I have Jeffrey on call 24 hours a day. He's a highly skilled masseur, you know. Have you noticed the man's hand? They're strong and very powerful. - Well, would you like me to call him for you? Unless there's something I can do to help. - It's nice of you to offer, but look at your hands, they're so delicate. I'd better call Jeffrey. (sighs) - See, I'm a lot stronger than I look, aren't I? - Mm-hmm. Hmm. (Ruanda gasping) (telephone ringing) - Three days, where the hell is she? - And now, 10 years later, Madame Ruanda has made millions with her cosmetological clinic and health spa, which has become a mecca for women in search of renewed beauty and physical well being. Tonight we have invited Madame Ruanda to demonstrate a new technique, which she claims actually reverses the aging process of the skin. Ladies and gentlemen, Madame Ruanda. - Thank you. This is Selena, she will aid me in the demonstration. I have named my new revolutionary process chemo-domest-ism. It is a deceptively simple process, and relatively painless. The results however (groans) are quite startling. Because we utilize a small electrical current, it is necessary to secure the hands and arms. (whimpers) So that we will not move about. What might look like ordinary mud is, in reality, a patented compound, in which certain chemical and other ingredient work together in a synergistic manner with dermatological tissues. - For the prices you charge, Madame Ruanda, you could have at least given this a more pleasant aroma. But it shouldn't bother you that much anyway. (Ruanda speaks muffled-ly) - What is very important is that you have to apply the mud following the muscles. (moaning) So by the time the electrical current's in, (Ruanda speaks muffled-ly) On the muscle. (moaning) You stay awake 'cause (moaning drowns out speech) It's a miracle. (moaning) (speaking urgently and muffled-ly) (sobbing muffled-ly) (speaking urgently and muffled-ly) (sobbing muffled-ly) It's ready. (yelling muffled-ly) These tiny electrodes provide the current I spoke about earlier. (whimpering loudly) (speaking urgently and muffled-ly) (yelling) (buzzing) The regulator controls the amount of electricity (moans) to which the subject is exposed. (buzzing) (moaning) (yelling) (crackling) - We've been building a case on that woman's white slavery operation for almost a year. And what have we got? A dead Madame Ruanda, fried in her own goddamn chair. A missing bodyguard named Jeffrey, who will probably turn up in Manila Bay. And a list of three blondes who checked out of Ruanda Land on the day of the accident. Great, just great, now who's next? - James, remember that new syndicate you mentioned might be moving into the area? Anything happen with that? - Well, it's still sketchy. But we've managed to fill in a couple of blanks. It's an American-Asian coalition. We think they started putting it together about eight months ago, for the main purpose of moving in on the action here in the islands and Hong Kong and Indonesia. (sighs) Why do you ask? - It's just a thought, but see if it makes any sense to you. Stockwell is given a chance to work with this new syndicate. He refuses, they hit him. They do the same thing with Ruanda. That takes care of smuggling and white slavery. Which leaves only-- - Drugs. Sorry for interrupting you, but the idea makes a lot of sense. Which means their next target, assuming that your theory is correct, will be either Rossimo or Calderon. - Or both, Jim, I'm going to pay Rossimo and Calderon a little visit. - (chuckling) Are you going to offer them protection? - What choice do I have? They'll probably think I'm crazy. But we have got to keep those two bastards alive. - Keep me posted. Let me know how things go with our two drug lords. It's a goddamn shame we can't just let them get hit. - Hello, Domingo, what can I do for you? Fix a part in-di-ca, break a case? - I'll get right to it, Rossimo. We think there is a contract out on you, bought by some playmates of yours in Asia or the States. - Now wait a minute-- - Shut up and listen. Now, whether you like it or not, my men are going to stay close enough to smell what you had for breakfast. So make sure your goons keep the safeties on their Magnums. They won't do you any good anyway, because if they use the same pro that hit Stockwell and Ruanda, well, you know how neat those kills were, huh Carlos? - Thanks for the warning, De La Torres. It's very nice of you guys to take a special interest. But why would anybody want to murder a simple canned good importer like me? And pay to have it done? (chuckling) - Let's say it's a mercy warning. To try and save you from what a lot of people I know consider it's a mercy killing. Anyway, Calderon, try and keep yourself in one piece until we can get you legally. - Remember, when you leave here, this is a very bad neighborhood. You can't be too careful. (laughing) Well, I guess that evens us up in the unnecessary advice department, eh, Domingo? (Rossimo laughing) (engine rumbling) (men shouting) (machinery clanking) (phone buzzes) - Hey! - De La Torres. - Fox on the line. - Well hello. Samantha? Where the hell have you been? - Is that a personal or a professional question? - Answer, though, 'cause I missed you. - I thought you said those killings were keeping you so busy that you'd forgotten where the bed was. And then I read in the papers about this Madame Boo-ganda. - That's Ruanda, darling. Anyway, when are we getting together? - I thought you might like to take me to the cock fights this weekend. I've never been to one. (squawking) (crowd shouting) (speaking in foreign language) (roosters squawking) (crowd roaring) Come on! (sighs) (sighs) (audience applauding) (whistle shrills) Come on! (Samantha moans) (whistle shrills) Come on, come on! (crowd yelling) (whistle shrills) Come on! (moaning) Come on! (gasping) (Samantha moaning) Good morning, darling. - Good morning. - Mm, ah, tie me, will you? Thanks, and thanks for yesterday, I really enjoyed myself. - So did I. It was your idea, thanks yourself; what's the rush? - Oh, I've got things to do. I've been away for a few days, remember? - Good morning, Miss. What can I do for you? - I'm Melinda Burroughs, Mr. Bulacon. Miss Chao said to drop in and see you. She said you might have some pieces I would be interested in. - Shall we go this way? You know, it is really very nice Lee Wa, sending me your business. In fact, she helped me get mine off the ground. Oh, some exquisite new pieces came in recently. I keep 'em in here. A private viewing. (crowd roaring) - Let's hit a few clubs, there's a new one at the Atomic. It's supposed to have a great rock group. - Kind of late, isn't it? - Oh, come on, Domingo. Don't be such a drag, pop a few vitamins or whatever you do when you're 33. - Okay. (rock music) (patrons chattering) - Oh. (laughing) - Slumming, Sherlock, or am I getting special service? - Ah, Carlos, I thought you and the boys hung out at the Sin Colitros? - Colitros started going down a couple of weeks ago. I started looking for some new action. And this place has it. I know I'm not family, Domingo, but don't I even rate an introduction? - Of course you do, Carlos; Carlos Rossimo, Samantha Fox. - A pleasure, Mr. Rossimo. (audience applauding) Won't you join us? - I'd like to, \but I'm really in the mood for some dancing, thanks anyway. - So am I, come on, Domingo. We're just getting into high gear. - Uh uh, I'd rather watch you than dance. Why don't you dance with Carlos? He looks very good on the floor. - Are you sure you won't mind? - Not at all. I'd better warn you, Carlos. She's a killer on the dance floor, watch yourself. (groovy rock music) - How's the murder business? What's on your mind? Murder? Solving? - Yep, it's never far from it, why? - Oh, most men talk about what they do. You, you're like a clam. - You're not much better yourself. It's okay. I'll give you a few details, in return for a few. Let's take Portman. My theory says you met him at the Tennis Club. You parlayed your charms into an invitation for fun and games, and then killed him. - Interesting, but why me? - Because unfortunately, you're a contract pro, Sam, who enjoys what she does. Now there is talk, but that one I'm convinced of. We both know you were posing as Melinda Burroughs. And even money says you came back a second time disguised as a maid. That leaves the good madam. - So it does. You wouldn't care to account for a few missing days in your life, would you? - Oh I was alone at sea, it was really rather boring. That's why I came back. - No matter. The Stockwell and Ruanda killings were related. And I think I know who's next on the list. - Oh, there's a list? - Stop playing naive! Yeah, there is a list, it's either your friend Calderon or your dancing partner Rossimo. Now then, you tell me. - You don't really expect me to, do you? If you're so convinced, why don't you just arrest me? - Evidence is all circumstantial. But you don't really have to, tell me, I mean. I have warned them both there is a contract out. And my boys are practically living with them. - Don't lie there sounding so self-righteous. It doesn't become you. - No more than killing people becomes you! - Everybody you've mentioned was or is a parasite preying on decent society. And Lord only knows how much more blood they'd have drained while you've built an airtight case! - What the hell is that supposed to mean? - Oh I know all about it, Dom. My father was murdered 12 years ago because of it. Oh yeah, he was an honest businessman trying to fight the mob muscling in. Police knew, but they needed evidence. They got it, all right, my father's corpse. And I may as well answer your next question, Chief. You see because the guys that got my father, they didn't take their time about it. They didn't do it up right. So by accident they got my mother too. (gasps) Oh, and I know all about you too, lover! You're not a cop by choice. You're a cop because your parents were unlucky enough to get out of some banana country with their lives and their money. And when they got here safely and made a good life for themselves, they figured they owed. So they paid back by giving their son to do his public service! (Domingo sighs) What are my alternatives? - You can go ahead with it. And I'll nail you this time, Sam. - Or? - You can call it quits while you're still ahead. You said it yourself. So far, you've done the taxpayers a favor. - And then what? Spend the rest of my life rotting beside the pool of some country club? - That's not exactly the way I imagine my wife's life would be. - We'd never make it, not with what you know. Besides, I owe you a few. - Sam. - [Samantha] Sh. I'm giving you a chance to catch up. One sportsman to another. - Yeah. Hello? - If you would like to know who has the contract out on you, Monsieur Rossimo, I strongly urge you to be on the third base side of the Rizal Park at precisely 6:30 this evening. If you talk to anyone regarding this call, it's off, understood, monsieur? - Who the hell is this? Hello, hello! (telephone ringing) - Hello! - Mr. Calderon. - Yeah, this is Calderon. - If you would like to find out who has the contract out on you, I strongly advise you to be on the first base side of the Rizal Stadium at exactly 6:33 tonight. Not a second earlier. If you tell anyone except your own men, it's off, understood? (light music) - That looks good. - Yes, ma'am. (light music) (horn blaring) (comical music) - [Sanchez] Domingo, so far it's been one long shopping trip, my feet are killing me from a forced march through Chinatown. She's leaving the Gallery Bulacon in Air-mee-ta. You better run and check on this place. She came out carrying one hell of a large package, and it didn't look like any painting to me. - [Domingo] Stick with her, Sanchez. But Christ, don't ever take her granted. - [Sanchez] Here I go again! (groovy blues rock music) (tires squealing) - Yes? - Bill's on the line. - Put him through; Bill? - I hate like hell to tell you this, but we just lost Rossimo. (tires squealing) - Lose the bastards, lose the bastards. (groovy blues rock music) (tires squealing) (laughing) (tires squealing) (engine rumbling) (Sanchez yelling) (explosion booming) (clattering) (groovy rock music) (suspenseful music) (gun clicks) (dog barking) (slow, suspenseful music) (dog barking) (tense, suspenseful music) (gun clicks) (dog barking) (ricocheted gunshot whizzes) (gunshots booming) (people yelling) (telephone ringing) - Hello. Oh hi, Domingo, isn't it a great day? Sure, I'll be here. Ciao. (soft music) Poor baby. A good man trapped in a bum job. I wonder if a certain part of you wants out. Hell, I've even toyed with the idea retiring. Maybe the two of us. - [Newsboy] Read all about it, Rizal Stadium shootout. Gang warfare on baseball diamond, read all about it! (bomb ticking) (tires squealing) (engine rumbling) - Domingo, you look like you've been up all night. - I can see you weren't bothered by insomnia. - Come on in the cabin and relax. I saw the papers this morning. Looks like you've got another little puzzler on your hands. They say it was gang warfare. - That's what they're saying all right, gang warfare. - But you're not buying it? - Right again. No, the fight at the stadium was more than just two junk merchants arguing about their turf. But I'll tell you what does puzzle me. The death of one of my best men, his name was Sanchez. - You don't mean the detective that was killed in that automobile accident? I read about that too. - Level with me, Samantha, how did Sanchez really die? - The papers were right this time, it was an accident. - Let's play detective, hmm? Assuming that what went down at the stadium was a hit or hits, and not simply gang warfare, I have just one hypothetical question. Whose feet did you shoot at? - What's the difference? The other man would react irrationally anyway, out of fear; he'll simply assume that the bullets are coming from the people he can see. And he'll open fire. But I'd shoot at Calderon. He looked like such a nice man. Which means that poor Mr. Rossimo would be the first to get it. Are you going to arrest me, Dom? - Not today, Samantha, not today. - Then come with me, all you've got is a ball-busting DA, some clever theories and a warehouse full of circumstantial evidence; we both know that. - We both know I can't come with you. But I might have to follow you. - Well, if you're going to follow me, we better have our farewell drink now. I'm leaving for Rome today. Red wine for saying goodbye, my favorite color. To us, Domingo, and to you. You're a damned good cop. And one hell of a man. (chuckling) I don't believe you, Domingo. Did you really think I'd put something in your drink? Jesus Christ, I can walk out of here. Out of Manila right now. You said it yourself. - To you, Sam, safe journey. And remember, I'll be right behind you. (Domingo thudding) - Right behind me, Domingo? I hope so, I really do. (funky music) My darling Domingo, you are the best I've run across in years. And I love you, darling, so I'm giving you a chance, something I'm not noted for in certain circles. You have between five and eight minutes before a time bomb in the hold detonates. The yacht will go up like a Roman candle. So I suggest you get to work on those knots. They're Chinese. If you're patient and methodical, two of your best strengths, you'll be able to free yourself with a few seconds to spare. I hope you make it. I can't think of anyone I'd rather have follow me anywhere. All my love, Melinda B. (suspenseful rock music) (airplane roaring) (woman on loudspeaker speaks faintly) - [Woman On PA] Airline flight (speaking faintly). (ticking) (ticking) (explosion booming) (sultry jazz rock music)
