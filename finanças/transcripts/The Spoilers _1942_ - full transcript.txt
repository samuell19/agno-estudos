(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) MAN 1: You want to get rich in this country, you ought to marry a hen. MAN 2: Brother, I did. Only she can't lay no eggs. No. No, not for 200. Not for any amount. Yeah, but I tell you, I gotta have a room. I tell you, I just ain't got a room. (GUN FIRING) Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Guest just checking out. Lee Marcus. Take 24, right on down the hall. Oh, yeah. Much obliged. Wait a minute, Flapjack! Wait a minute! Flapjack! What are you aiming to do? I'm getting me a gun, some liquor and a gold commissioner. (UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) Snake juice, and plenty of it. Hello, Flapjack, what are you doing in town? Claim peter out? If it had, them mangy warthogs wouldn't have jumped us. So they got you, too, eh, Flapjack? Sure. We were just working along, kind of peaceful-like, when at least 20 of them jumped us, so what chance did we have? You still have five fingers on your gun hand, ain't ya? You mean to tell us Flapjack was chased off his claim and didn't do nothing? Why, he polluted the gulch with language that shouldn't be inside of no man without being fumigated. What good did it do? They had the law with them. Huh! The law. What are we anyway, a bunch of hibernating Siwashes take a thing like this laying down? What are you gonna do about it? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. Listen, fellows, I'm getting me a gun. And any of you wanna come along will see plenty of action. If it's action you boys want, the games are open, the roof the limit. But if you're really playful, I'll take that off, too. Now look here, Cherry, that ain't the kind of action we're talking about. Is there some other kind? They went and hopped my claim and I ain't a-gonna take it sitting down. You're gonna do some shooting, eh, Flapjack? You bet I am. And some hitting what I shoot at. Now, now, now. Don't be in a rush. Maybe we better think this over. I don't want to have to walk out one morning and find you standing under that old sycamore with your feet just off the ground. But you grubstaked me to this claim yourself. So I have something to say about it. Now, you and Banty have another drink and stay here. Looks like they're jumping from one claim to another like so many grasshoppers, doesn't it, Bronco? Seems like all you got to do to get a man's claim away from him is to file an affidavit. So far, they're only the small ones. Meaning what? Well, there's no reason their system can't work with the big claims. Such as the Midas? With both owners away, why not? Maybe someone should call on the gold commissioner. What's his name? Alexander McNamara, according to his billing. Shall I drop in on him? No. First, let's do a little checking up. My way. Good morning, Cherry. Harry. Hello, Cherry. How are things, Bill? Just fine, thank you. Morning, Seth. Ravishing as usual, Miss Malotte. Glad to see you're out of jail again, Mr. Skinner. A temporary arrangement only. I'll be back in again by nightfall, I dare say. Well, well, Miss Malotte. Why, this is certainly a pleasure to see you here. Thank you, Mr. Montrose. I want some information about the ownership of a claim registered under the name of Flapjack Simms. Simms? Simms. Simms, yes. Simms, Simms, Simms. Here we are. That's been relocated. It has? Under whose name? Why, a Mr. Clark and a Mr. Bennett. We have their affidavit right here. Let's see now. Clark, Bennett. Clark... Oh, yes, here we are. Clark and Bennett. Clark and Bennett. Now, see? Can I see this, Monte? Now, you won't mind if I borrow this, will you, Monte? Nice place to keep my records, but the question is, what about access? You got to that one easy enough. I'm Cherry Malotte. I suppose you're Mr. McNamara. G.C., gold commissioner. Tell the marshal I want to see him, will you, Montrose? Yes, sir. Putting me in jail, Mr. McNamara? Serious business, stealing government records. As serious as claim-jumping? Got some particular case in mind? Mmm-hmm. The claim of Flapjack Simms. I grubstaked him. I know he made the original discovery. Now Clark and Bennett swear they filed in the spring. And I know they didn't come to Nome before November. That's why I want this affidavit as evidence. Strong talk, Miss Malotte. But I'm here to protect the interests of the small owner. Mmm-hmm. But if you happen to be, let's say, smart, you could do yourself a lot of good, couldn't you, Mr. McNamara? I'm wondering just how smart you are. Well, I've been educated. So have I. So how you operate is no concern of mine. I mean, with two exceptions. The Simms claim... And a certain mine, the Midas. Well, that puts us into the big-money class, doesn't it? Got an interest in the Midas? Mmm-hmm. Stock? No, not exactly. Oh, personal. One of the partners? Glennister? Well, I don't know much about him, but offhand I'd say he has good taste. Thanks. He does all right in other ways, too. Not a man to be pushed around, Mr. McNamara. Might make it interesting, would he, if I wanted to move into his territory? Could be tough going, Mister. But worth it. So... Commissioner, what's this I hear about you wanting me to arrest Miss Malotte? No, no. I want you to round up Clark and Bennett right away. There are a few questions I want to ask them. Yes, sir. Well, Cherry, I... Some other time, Marshal. You'll always be welcome. You work fast, Commissioner. Thank you. And since you have a safer place to store papers than I have, perhaps you'd better keep this. Fair enough? Well, I could be wrong. If I should happen into the Northern some night, would you show me around? Show you around? Sure. If it could be done. Goodbye. And I've been here all this time. Somebody should have told me. About Clark and Bennett? Yeah... No. About Cherry Malotte. You met McNamara? Let's say he met me. He's either a very honest man, or this town is really up against it. Well, after we'd run into bedrock after digging for three weeks, well, we started to... (SHIP HORN BLOWING) Look, the boat's here! Boat! Come on, you sourdoughs, the boat's in! The boat's in! Come on! Come on, get out of here! The boat's in! Come on, the boat's in! He's back, Bronco, he's back. You're pretty sure he's on that boat, aren't you? If he isn't, I'm going to find out why not. Shall I get the buggy out? Yes. I'll be right down. Bronco, never mind that buggy. For once, I'll let him come to me. Idabelle? Idabelle? Idabelle? Idabelle, where are you? Here I is, Miss Cherry. Here I is. What are you doing with that dress? Just smoothing it out a bit. I heard that loudmouth baboon yelling that the boat was in. I figured y'all wanted to meet it in style. You did, huh? Well, you can unsmooth it again. I'm staying right here. What? Mr. Glennister is sure enough on that boat, ain't he? Chase down and get a bottle of brandy and a dozen hard-boiled eggs. Better get a dozen bottles of brandy and one egg, Miss Cherry. Eggs is scarcer than watermelons around here. I don't care how scarce they are. Get them. There's two things he goes for in a big way, and one of them is hard-boiled eggs. I reckon the other's ice cream, huh, Miss Cherry? I sure hope there's some colored folks on that boat. I's getting mighty tired pretending Eskimos is from Virginia. (SHIP HORN BLOWING) She sure makes this old saloon smell nice. BRONCO: Cherry. I knew you couldn't hold out. Makes me some kind of a fool, doesn't it? No. It makes you the right sort of a gal. Only it seems a shame to turn on all that good heat for a guy like Glennister. You never will like him, will you, Bronco? No, and you know why. Giddap. (ALL YELLING) That looks like Glennister. Up you go. She could be a relative. Yeah. Maybe his Aunt Hetty. Roy, you old sinner. Cherry. It's good to see you, sport. How are you? Better now. For a few minutes, I wasn't so sure. This is Helen Chester. Cherry Malotte. How do you do, Miss Malotte? Roy's told me all about you. Oh. Oh, well. No need to ask if you enjoyed your trip, Miss Chester. I know Roy's talent for entertaining on shipboard, don't I, Roy? Easy, Cherry. Traveling alone, Miss Chester? No. I'm with my uncle, Judge Stillman. He's coming ashore with Roy's partner, Mr. Dextry. Yep, the law. He's circuit court judge. I'm sure you'll be glad to know that law and order has come to Nome, Miss Malotte. Yes. It will be so much easier on the boys if the girls have to turn in their guns. Roy's promised to look after me and find me a place to live, that is if you have no objection, Miss Malotte. Well, I thought I'd take Miss Chester to Widow Smith's place. And I wouldn't lose any time getting there. Miss Chester looks rather tired. Yes, I am, rather. Shall we go, Roy? Come on, Cherry. No, I'll wait. I want to see Dextry. All right. See you tonight, sport. Hey, Cherry! Well, Cherry. How's my little girl? Right now, your little girl has murder in her heart. You said you were going to protect my interests. Now, wait a minute... Wait nothing. We have things to talk about. Come on. Let's take the good with the bad, what do you say? You like her a lot, don't you? That's the situation. FLAPJACK: All right, Clark! Come out of there, Clark! I know you're in there! Come out! Come out of there! You ain't hopping no claim of mine, Clark! Grab for your gun! Yank her out! No, you don't. Are you hurt bad, Flapjack? Where'd he get you, old timer? If you get my claim back, Roy, turn her over to Banty, and kindly bury me at sea on account of I always hankered to be a sailor. I hate to disappoint you, Flapjack, but I never heard of anyone dying from a scratch like that. You mean to say I ain't dying? I'm afraid not. Oh, dagnab it. Just when a fellow thinks he's got shed of his troubles, That's the nearest I ever come to owning a mine my whole life. Shut up! We ain't got no mine till we get her back, have we? Take him over to our tent, Banty. Dextry will fix him up. Come on, you disappointed corpse, you. Didn't scare you, did it? Do these things happen very often around here? No more than once a day. Lucky for Simms you happened along, Mister. Yeah. You're a stranger here. Not exactly. McNamara. Gold commissioner. How are you? I'm Glennister. The Midas. Oh, Miss Chester, Mr. McNamara. How do you do, Mr. McNamara? Miss Chester is Judge Stillman's niece. Fine. Glad to know the judge has arrived. You know him? By reputation. Well, it's a small town. We'll bump into each other again, I imagine. Sure. Probably at the Northern. I'll be glad to show you the room. And being as I ain't got nothing else, this will have to do till we get something better, Miss Chester. And if there's anything else I can do for you, why, you just let me know. I don't suppose Mr. Glennister brung you all the way up from Seattle for nothing. So, if you're thinking about getting married or anything, why, I'd be very glad to let you have the loan of my room for a week or so. It's very much more comfortable. It will be a shame to disappoint a nice old lady like Mrs. Smith, won't it? She'll get over it. But will I? It sounds terrible. I feel like a designing woman. What am I gonna do? What puzzles me is the world is full of so much better material, why me? I could say the same thing to you. Why Cherry Malotte? But it just happens to be that way, doesn't it? You're not annoyed? Well, if I am, it's not hard to take. Well, if I have to compete with someone, you might at least let me get off on even terms. Is that what you mean? Partly. No more? You know, right now would be a good time for somebody to knock at that door. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) One of the boys is coming with your luggage. (EXCLAIMS) I didn't come in at the wrong time, did I? You couldn't have timed it better. I'll see you after a while. Goodbye, Roy. I guess there's a lot of girls that would like to be in your shoes. Mr. Glennister's a real man. I'm beginning to think he is. Miss Cherry, you sure looks like the kind of medicine good for what ails a man. All we need, then, is the man, eh? If you's referring to me, Miss Cherry, there sure is an absence of good, solid color in this here country. And no chance of choosing, Idabelle? Did y'all say as how Mr. Glennister'd be coming right along? I didn't say. And you haven't heard anyone breaking down doors trying to get in here, have you? We've been wasting a lot of time waiting for something we're not gonna get, Idabelle. You mean, Mr. Glennister ain't coming here no more? That's it. No more. But, Miss Cherry, we done given that man the best years of our life. We sure have. But, Miss Cherry, what am I gonna do with all them nice hard-boiled eggs? If you want better results than I got, try sitting on them. I can't sit on no eggs. I'll mash them all to pieces. (ROY WHISTLING) All right, Dex, light her up and speak your piece. Huh? Come on, old-timer. When you start sucking on a cold pipe and mooning around, there's something gnawing at you. What is it? Some sort of a spy, ain't you? Well, when two men have been snowbound in a two-by-four shack through a Yukon winter, they walk out come spring either good friends and knowing each other or else they... One of them walks out alone. We've had nine of those winters, partner. Count them. Think nine years gives me license to say what I'm thinking? Well, shoot. If I don't like it, I can always punch you in the nose. Yeah, if you catch me when I ain't looking. I been thinking about Cherry. You saw her? Yeah. For a couple of minutes. Look, Roy, I know you like this Chester girl... Well, they come from different schools, partner. Yeah, but Cherry will weigh out the better of the two in the long run. A woman don't have to wear a polish like a new dime just out of the mint. Them that picks up a little experience along the way goes just as good over the counter. A philosophizing old sourdough, eh? Look, son. Close as we've always been, I've never nosed into your real private notions. It's all right for a man to turn a corner here and there along the way, but you and Cherry's all the family I got and I feel sort of father-like towards you both. I don't want to see nothing split you up. And nothing's going to, either, partner. I don't know. She's pretty head-up. She'll get over that five minutes after I get there. Well, 10, anyway. ♪ Oh, I will take you back, Kathleen ♪ To where your heart will feel no pain ♪ And when the fields are fresh and green ♪ I'll take you to your home again ♪ Your home again Hello, Mr. Service. Writing a poem about me? Not this time, Cherry. This is about a lady known as Lou. Is there a man in her life? Yes. He's called Dan McGrew. He's a bad actor. He gets shot. Sounds exciting. The shooting of Dan McGrew. SKINNER: Ravishing as usual, Miss Malotte. Still out of jail, I see, Mr. Skinner? In and out. How are you doing in the draw, boys? Bad. Will you rub my head for luck, Cherry? I'll do better than that. I'll give you a shuffle. You need a recess, Bronco. I'll take over. You're the boss. Ante, gentlemen. How's for horning in, sport? But if you're craving action, there will be a new deal coming up. MAN 1: I'll start her rolling. MAN 2: I'll call it. MAN 3: Pass. MAN 4: Pass. Could a fellow do himself some good in a game like this? The only luck in poker is the draw. After that, it becomes a game of skill. Cards, boys? Give me three. How's a man's chances of improving a pair? Not so good, they tell me. I'll play these. Sure ain't my night, Cherry. I'll be cashing in. Guess I'll sneak out, too. I'll be leaving. Well, if you get enough players for a new game, Cherry, I'll be over at the bar. Remember what I said when I left? "When I get back, sport, we'll make up for all the time I've been away." Well, I'm back. Yeah. I met the boat, remember? Now, listen, honey, you're not asking for apologies and alibis are you? If I was the kind that bends at the knees, you wouldn't have any use for me. But you're not. So I suppose I can't get along without you. Sure you can, which also goes for me. We could do with a lot less food, too, but we'd get awfully hungry. But if you get too much of any one thing, it's a pretty good idea to make a change. Come on, sport. Let's get back to normal. Why don't we slip upstairs and talk things over? We've got nothing to talk about. Miss Malotte. Mr. McNamara, this is Mr. Glennister. Yes, we've met. Not butting into a private game, am I? No. Pile right in. In fact, you can have my chair. I just cashed out. No luck? Percentage is with the house. But it has been done, hasn't it, Mr. McNamara? Anyhow, it's a fair gamble, especially if the house will take off the limit. There's no limit here. Anything you can win, you can collect. McNamara, we want to talk to you. Some of us boys ain't satisfied with the way you been handling things. There will be a circuit court here in a day or so. If you got any complaints to make, that's the place to make them. The only thing we do know is there was no trouble till you came here. You're not trying to tie me in with it, are you, friend? Suppose we are. (PEOPLE YELLING) All right, all right, all right. Fight's over. Get back to your tables. Get back here. Get back to your tables. Fight's over. Pete, Sonny, pick them up and throw them out. We'll have no brawls here, gentlemen. Unless they're over me. Thanks, Glennister. That's one I owe you. Don't mention it. I hope I didn't make a mistake. Meaning you've got an idea I might have had it coming to me? There's just a chance the whole town could be wrong. So long, sport. His pants may need a bit of pressing, but a nice lad. You promised to show me around, remember? Mmm-hmm. I haven't forgotten. Some other time. Hold on there. Stay right where you are. Who are you and what do you want? I'm Jonathan Struve, gentlemen, legal representative for the gold commissioner. I'm here to serve notice on you. Don't get scared, Mr. Struve. This old elephant gun of mine just gets spells now and then. If there's one thing she ain't got no time for, it's legal hocus-pocus. You're gonna regret this, Dextry. Mr. Galloway has filed proper legal action against this property, and you're gonna have to answer... (GUN FIRING) DEXTRY: Behave yourself, Betsy. Come here. Don't mind Betsy, Mr. Struve. That's just her way of saying goodbye. Judge Stillman will be notified of this. I imagine he'll know how to handle the situation. (GUN FIRING) (ROY LAUGHING) Nice work, Dex. Helen. Finally decided to see what a gold mine looks like, eh? Roy, what was all the shooting? Just Dex's way of informing lawyers they can't serve papers here. Papers? You mean, a court order? Yeah, I think that's what they called it. We've got a different name for them. If it's a court order, it must have been signed by my uncle, which doesn't make it quite so funny, does it? Why not? Because it just isn't a laughing matter. This country's in need of law and discipline. I've heard you say so yourself any number of times. Look, Helen, it's impossible for anybody to file an honest claim to this property. Why, when Dex and I made this strike, there weren't a half a dozen men in the whole section. Well, if you can prove that, you've nothing to fear. We can prove it, all right, but just the same, we're gonna hang on to our property. And nobody's gonna take it away from us. But you both know Uncle Horace, and you know that any decision of his will be equitable and just. Sure, we know that. Maybe we were a little hasty. But you didn't come out here to talk about law. There's my cabin on the hill. Beautiful view from there. Come on. I'll show you around. (HUMMING) Miss Cherry? Miss Cherry? Where at is Mr. Glennister's pipe and tobacco? Under the couch. Leave them there. Now what kind of talk is that? Can't do yourself no good holding out on them softening influences. I knows that. What are you doing under that couch? I told you to leave them there. And what's all this junk? What's wrong with you, child? Didn't you say Mr. Glennister's coming? Yes, but that's all it means. How you gonna do yourself good with a man unless you starts him out right? Now, you put that tray right down, Miss Cherry. I'm gonna put it somewhere where he can't find it. Hiya, sport. Dex passed me the good word and I came right along. Brandy and hard-boiled eggs. You never forget a thing, do you, baby? You're fired, Idabelle. Yessum. Would you hold this, Roy, darling? This is just to let you know I didn't send for you for the reason you've got in mind. I must have stumbled into the wrong apartment. Who lives here? Nobody you're on friendly terms with, I can tell you that. Idabelle, take that tray and get out of here. Oh, no, you don't. This tray stays right here. Well, does I or don't I take that tray? If there's anything else you wants in the near future, you calls and hopes. No more little champagne suppers or playing Chopsticks on the piano together? It's a long, cold winter, sport. But we're through, eh? You seem to have set yourself up for the winter, so that takes care of that, doesn't it? But you won't mind if I slip in a word here and there about us, will you? Dextry's got an idea that McNamara and Judge Stillman are a crooked combine, hiding behind a law-and-order front. Dex is full of suspicions. But we can talk about that later. When are you gonna come down off of that perch? But Dex could be right, and if he is, how about your dear little friend, Miss Chester? Nice gal, as gals go. Mmm-hmm. And really refined, isn't she? A lady all over. She probably wouldn't know how to use a man for a chump if she had a chance, would she? Worried? About you? Why should I be? Besides, you're much too smart to be taken over, aren't you? New dress. where you let them walk in and take your mine away from you. I imagine that dress is supposed to have a chilling effect. Well, if it is, it isn't working. 'Cause you'd look good to me, baby, in a burlap bag. Here. You are so sure of yourself, aren't you? Everything arranged for your convenience. You just can't lose. Well, see what you can do with this! Nice aim you got there, baby. Only I think it's time we understood each other a little better. Come here. I'm warning you, Roy. Don't do it. You've got it coming, and you're gonna get it. I don't know what you've built up in your mind about Helen Chester and myself, but whatever it is, there's nothing to it. And from now on, things are gonna be run my way, and you can start adjusting yourself to that idea. And that's my way. Like it? Well... I guess that's what you'd call putting it right on the line. That's good enough for me, sport. Final curtain, eh? I did that beautifully, didn't I? Maybe this would be a good time for a man to speak his piece. You know, Cherry, you could do worse than with a dude like me. You could peddle this joint. We could slip down to Frisco, where I got connections. Get back to your table, Bronco. I didn't know he dug himself in so deep. Cause for tears, eh? Tears? You know me better than that. Get below. You're the boss. What the devil's the matter with you? Hey, Flapjack, here they come. Just what we been waiting for. Come on, Banty. Hey, boys. Come on. BANTY: Dextry! Dex! What's wrong? What's wrong? They're a-coming, Dex. They're a-coming. Yeah, a whole gang of them. Get your guns, boys, and get ready for action. Get your gun, Roy. Where's your gun? Have an idea I won't need it. You're inclined to be little quick on that trigger with old Betsy there. They ain't gonna move in on no mine of ours. Stay right where you are, gents. That's far enough. I'm here again to serve you, Glennister. You gonna accept the summons peaceably or do we have to use force? We're not accepting any papers, Struve. You heard him, Struve. We got you covered from every point. We're not looking for trouble, Glennister. Perhaps you'd better talk to Judge Stillman. We ain't got nothing to talk about. We own a mine and we aim to keep it. Easy, Dex. You and the judge can come up. The rest of you stay on your horses. Good morning, gentlemen. I'm sorry my first visit has to be an official one. Talk right from there, judge. Betsy here's getting nervous. I realize how you gentlemen feel, but I wish, for the benefit of everybody concerned, you'd try to see my situation in this litigation. Once the ownership of your mine has been established through legal channels, it can never be disputed again. There's no better title insurance than a sound court decision. Well, suppose we give you this cooperation. What happens then? Until the case is heard, the court appoints a receiver to operate the Midas, the takings being held aside subject to a court order, a matter of a few days. That's all it means. And when I open court Monday morning, I promise you that your case will be heard immediately. What happens to that gold in our safe? That stays right here on the property, under guard and sealed by the court. Well, I've always been for law and order, and now that it's in Nome, I don't wanna do anything to throw it off-stride. Maybe we had better fall in line with the judge, Dex. You don't mean you're gonna let them move in on us, do you, Roy? It's only till Monday. Galloway can't prove he discovered this mine. Why, we'd beat him in any court in the world. Your partner's right, Dextry. You ought to listen to him. I ain't got to listen to nothing. Get out of here! Steady, Dex. Let's be sensible. The law's working in 45 states. It ought to work all right in Alaska. You don't mean to say you're gonna let them move in on us, do you, Roy? You heard what McNamara said. It will only be for a few days. Looks like you've made up your mind. So you want things legal, do you? All right. From this day on, our partnership is through. You and I are finished. Take that into court and legalize it. Wait a minute, Dex. What for? So I can have the fun of walking back to town with a weak sister? Not me. Don't worry, my boy. You've done the right thing. I'll show up in court for your answers, judge. But before you make any quick decisions, maybe I better tell you, don't make any mistakes. What else can I do, Cherry? But a man doesn't walk out on his partner, Dex. Any time a man hasn't got any more sense than to hand his pants over to the enemy, ain't no partner of mine. But if you're fond of somebody, you don't do things like that. You did. That was something else again. No, it wasn't. It's the same setup. You're crazy about him. You always was and you always will be. And you gave him the gate. Not the same at all. I don't love him. You're a liar. I said, you're a liar, Cherry. All right, I'm a liar. Of course you are. But I don't know... I guess if it come to a real showdown, I could stand a lot more from him myself. Blast him! Great little town, Nome. Something going on all the time. You wouldn't bother us if you had good news. Let's hear the worst. Remember that little safe Glennister used to have up at the mine? What do you mean, used to? It's still there. They ain't moved it, have they? I just saw them loading it into the bank. Stay here, Dex. Where do you think you're going? I'm gonna bear down on that bank. They ain't gonna swipe no safe of mine. Now, you're not gonna invite yourself into jail. Suppose we try another angle. There ain't no other angle. Catch as catch can is my way of doing business. Now, look, calm down, Dex. There's two lawyers in this town. One's named Struve, and we're going to see the other one. Come on. Come on. WHEATON: Supposing our suspicions are well-founded? What logically would be the intent and purpose of the opposition? Good evening, Cherry. How are you, Dextry? Yes, I think I know something about it. We've been discussing it. Come on, Dex. This place is haunted. Now, hold on. Hold on, Cherry. You know, you three have something in common here, and, well, this might be a good time to bury the hatchet. Fine, let's have it. I know right where to bury it. This is Cherry's idea, not mine. I never go to court about nothing. They grabbed our mine and stole our safe, and I'm for getting them back the same way they took them. Maybe Mr. Glennister doesn't know what happened to his safe. that we're quite aware of what's going on, will you, Wheaton? Miss Malotte, Roy has worked out what I consider a very sensible plan of action. How does Mr. Glennister look when he's acting brilliant? Little bubbles come out of my mouth and I smoke, but you ought to know about that. I thought it would be a good idea before we started the shooting war to see how this brawl in court comes out. Yes. Then if Judge Stillman doesn't restore the mine, well, it's up to me to go to Seattle, lay the facts before a higher court. That will cost money, won't it? Yes, 10,000 or more, I'd say. Which we'll manage to raise if we need it. You don't think they'll let you take your money out of your safe, do you? But we can't say yes or no until we hear how the hearing in court comes out, can we? And my guess is they'll toss the safe and the mine into the bay and what floats is yours. Come on, Dex. Well, if you ask me, that Judge Stillman's all right. Sure didn't take much time handing Flapjack his claim back to him. Say, if we want our seats, we better get in before court takes up again. Yeah. That's right. Come on, boys. FLAPJACK: So the judge says, he says, "I'm giving this mine back to who it belongs to." And that's me, by grabby! He's a judge that is a judge! Well, the old boy aimed his first guns well enough, Dex. Whenever he hits that Galloway a swift kick in the pants, I'm for him. Until then, I ain't saying nothing. I don't know whether he's gonna act like one or not, but at least he talks like a judge. HELEN: Roy. My pulse is back to normal, but the doctor says I'm not out of danger yet. Looks like the number-one boy may finish in front, eh, Cherry? You wouldn't bet two-to-one on that, would you? Now that we're old friends, you may call me Miss Malotte, if you'd rather. Still running cold. When comes the thaw? It's more fun this way. Besides, the line forms in back of the Bronco Kid. Mr. Farrell, Mr. McNamara. Hiya, Farrell. Something you got for Christmas? Yeah, I always carry it. I never know when I'm gonna run into a piece of cheese. Bronco was saying he could pick off the judge easily from up here. I bet him 65 cents he couldn't. Want half of it? Sure, it's only money. Do you mind if Miss Malotte and I go right on talking, just as though you weren't here? No, go right ahead. If you think you can talk faster than Glennister. Could be done. We sort of started something in my office one day. We never finished. Shouldn't we do something about that? We'll talk about it after we've heard what the judge has to say. Stand up, everybody! Here comes the judge. Take off your hats and no smoking! You can sit down now, and court will come to order. (WHISPERING) Next case, Mr. Struve. Galloway v. Dextry and GlennisterYour Honor. Oh, yes. Because of the crowded condition of the calendar, I regret to state that the court has been unable to give this case the consideration it merits. Also, we've been cautioned, privately, against making any mistakes. Consequently this case will be set forward 90 days. What? Why, it's a skin game! (ALL YELLING) Why, that's against ordinary decency! The old goat's a thief! I'm going over and pound him on the head. You're gonna stay right here! You turn me loose, and I'll tear him limb from limb! Stay right here! Quiet down! Quiet, this is a court! Quiet down! Mr. Dextry, if you are questioning the integrity of this court, may I warn you that you are liable to charges of contempt. But judge, you promised to decide this case today, and I demand that you do it. I told you I would hear it today. But in three months, a double shift could take a quarter of a million dollars out of the Midas. Mr. Glennister, if you have anything further to say to this court, I must ask that you say it through your attorney. Your Honor, I think this extension of time is unreasonable. I move the court set an earlier date for the examination. Motion denied. Sure! Of course it's denied! You fooled this young whippersnapper here, but you didn't fool nobody else! (CROWD YELLING) It's my duty to warn you, and this goes for the rest of the territory, that any further demonstration of lawlessness or threats of violence will force me to send for troops from St. Michael to maintain order. Court's adjourned. (CROWD YELLING) I told you that old flea-bitten weasel was a crook. But you wanted your way. Well, you had it. Now it's my turn! I hope you understand, Glennister, why the bank can't make you a loan. A court order is a court order. I understand. Thanks. Well, it looks like they've anticipated everything. Yeah. I'll try them once more. Get a hold of Dex, and keep him out of trouble. I'll meet you at the Northern in a half an hour. Say, by this time, Glennister's been to the bank. I'd like to have seen the expression on his face when he found his account was frozen. You'll have to credit me with the good idea on that one. Yeah, but Dextry's the one I want to see squirm. I can't wait to bend that rifle he calls "Betsy" over his confounded head! STILLMAN: Plenty of time for that, Struve. Hey, Alec, how much do you think we'll take out of that mine? Just what Glennister said. A quarter of a million. Oh, say, that ain't chicken feed. What's the matter with you, Helen? Aren't you gonna celebrate? A little premature, isn't it? How's that? Supposing they send Mr. Wheaton to Seattle. What happens then? Getting to Seattle and appealing to the higher courts takes money. There may be other ways of his getting it, Alec. That Malotte woman, for instance. Struve, what about the ship? Did you see the captain? He has his orders. Wheaton will not be allowed on board. That satisfy you? No. But then, I may have more respect for Roy Glennister than you have. Oh, yes, of course! He's a big, handsome lad, isn't he? I hope you're not softening up like a school kid on a hayride. We're here on business. Keep that in mind. Hold on, Alec! You haven't fallen in love with him, have you? Have you, Helen? Would there be some law against that? Roy! Judge, I've come to ask you to release our funds from the bank. How about it? Such a petition is a matter of court procedure, which will have to be handled through your counsel, Mr. Glennister. (EXCLAIMS) I understand you're sending Wheaton to Seattle, Glennister. Seems like the thing to do. Any objections? No, good idea. Hope he doesn't miss the boat. I don't think he will. You're not looking so good today, honey. Maybe Nome doesn't agree with you. Struve, it's your job to see that Wheaton misses that boat. Have him arrested, and lock him up in jail until the boat sails. but if anything slips, I'm holding you responsible. Now, go on, get busy. How much do you think Glennister heard? I don't know, and personally, I don't care. It's what happens from now on that interests me. That's enough of that. What I told Struve goes for you, too. And just to keep you on the right track, beautiful, this deal goes through as I planned it, all the way. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) How are you, Cap? Well, hello, Roy. Say, I'm glad to see you. Glad to see you, too. You're sailing tonight? Yes. I wish you could sail with me. But look, there's a friend of mine that... Wheaton? Yeah. I have orders not to let him come aboard. Federal law. Oh, that's what I heard. But if, after you sail, you were to see a man adrift in a small boat, say five miles offshore, you'd have to pick him up, wouldn't you? Sure. That'd be the humane thing to do. Besides, it's part of the maritime law. That's what I thought. Another drink? No, thanks. No, I'll have to keep my eye peeled tonight for derelicts. Thanks, Cap. But I tell you, Cherry, it's too late for legal shenanigans. If we don't get that money, how are we gonna send Wheaton to Seattle? I don't know what you're planning, Dex, So am I. Any unlawful act committed at this time might upset everything. Wheaton, you gotta get out of here. What happened, Roy? Plenty, but I'll explain later. Right now I want you to get over to Flapjack's mine and stay there until we come for you. And keep under cover! Well, old-timer, you were right. We're gonna do it your way. Well, now you're talking! You two are planning to dynamite yourselves into a mess. I won't let you do it. I could get about 4,000 together. That should be enough. How about it, Roy? We got a good-sized poke of our own. Why should we cut into yours? Come on, Dex. But that was a nice thought, sport. Thanks for now, and I'll be back later to put some lace on it. If it was my dough they were holding in that bank, I know what I'd do. Why don't you use charcoal, Banty? Because I like cork better. How are you, Mr. Bones? Mr. Tambo, I'm just about even. Even? Even better than I was before. Come on, son. All right, men, let's mount up. You all know what you're supposed to do. And remember, if you have to shoot, aim low. We don't want to kill anybody. Don't move! Sounded like an explosion. You want me to go take a look? No, never mind. I'll go. What's going on here? What happened? Bank robbery! They shot the marshal. Give us a hand, boys. Let's take him inside. Thanks, boys. Scatter and keep your mouths closed. Dex, get a hold of Wheaton and tell him what I told you. Don't lose any time getting him on that boat. What are you aiming to do? I got myself a date, and this time it's gonna stick. Remember Cherry? IDABELLE: Miss Cherry! Miss Cherry! Mr. Bronco ain't down there no place. He must've run out with everybody else after the big shooting. Who ever heard tell of a shooting when nobody was hurt? They don't go pointing a gun at somebody unless they figures to hit them, does they? What you drinking that cold cup of coffee for? Let me heat it. I'll be in the office if anybody wants me. Wait a minute, child. Why don't you just stay here and go to bed? I couldn't sleep. (GASPS) Colored boy! Where'd y'all come from? How's y'all, sweet thing? I figured it was about time for us to get acquainted. Is that so? Well, if y'all thinks I'm the common kind what messes around with anything that comes along. I says if you thinks I'm that kind of a person, I'll pour y'all a cup of coffee. Here, now, wait a minute! Y'all ain't no colored boy! You's washable. Why, it's Mr. Glennister! What you doing running around here, raising up a lady's hopes like that for? Wait till Miss Cherry sees you. Hold on a minute, Idabelle. Let's get rid of this Alabama tan first, and you better wash this shirt. But, Mr. Glennister, you's more handsome now than you's ever been before. Mmm-hmm. And Miss Cherry might feel the same way, and then I'd have to spend the rest of my life in a smokehouse. Now, go on, get me some soap and water. That's it, Cherry. I don't know any more about it than you do. When I got there, it was all over. But Roy and Dex were mixed up in it, weren't they? All I know is, the bank was robbed and the marshal was killed. All right, Bronco. Dummy up, Cherry. Here comes McNamara. Find Roy and tell him to keep away from the Northern. Right. Brought some friends with you, eh, McNamara? Much obliged. Cherry'll be glad to get the extra business. You wouldn't know where we can find Glennister, would you? Glennister? How would I know that? Been here all night? Well, yeah. I work here. who was seen in the vicinity of the bank just before the fun started. Handy little thing, isn't it? Yeah. CHERRY: Good evening, Mr. McNamara. Miss Malotte, I don't want to cause you any trouble, but we had to drop in for a look around. Glennister. We thought he might have headed here first, He's as welcome here as anybody else, as long as he behaves himself. I thought, because he had a certain interest here, he'd know that this would be the first place we looked. We want him for murder. Our little Roy really got himself into trouble, huh? Why should it? What you're thinking, McNamara, is yesterday's news. If you knew me better, you'd know I never play on the losing team. I'll have to look around your rooms upstairs as well as here. In the line of duty, you know. If you can't think of a better reason. You two boys cover the entrances. You come with me. Wait here. Well, here it is. Look it over. Nice place for a man to hide. Has possibilities, hasn't it? Mmm-hmm. If there were anything here to interest a fugitive. Think I could pass for a fugitive, if I acted up a little? That's nothing for us to talk about now, is it? I mean, with a gang of men waiting outside the door. Suppose I send them away? Why don't you? I should've gotten around to this sooner. (TAPPING) That's a bad habit you got there, McNamara. Jumping claims. Apt to get you in a lot of trouble someday. You got here in a hurry, didn't you, Glennister? We weren't expecting you for another 10 or 15 minutes. Bad habit of mine. Hard-boiled eggs. Don't trip over the shells on your way out. All right, boys, come in! Here's your man. What is this? Am I wanted for something? Good idea, the blackface stunt. You might've gotten away with holding up the bank, Glennister, but I think there's a city ordinance against killing marshals. If you're trying to pin something on me, Mr. McNamara, I'm afraid you're gonna draw a blank. I didn't know you were still here, Roy. I suppose you're gonna tell me he's been here all evening. Why not? It's a perfect alibi. Then why did you bring me up here? And all you found was my alibi. Now, run along and find your evidence. For a moment I thought I had you, Glennister, but I don't give up so easily. Perhaps a trip to Seattle might do you some good before I find the evidence. Well, come on, men. Mr. Glennister, I can't get this black stuff off y'all's collar. Excuse me. I didn't know y'all had company. All right, he's yours. So Wheaton sailed, huh? You're a blundering idiot, Struve! Did you hear what I said? You're a confounded, blundering idiot! But I got out a warrant. What more could I do? You could've foreseen what would happen if he wasn't apprehended, couldn't you? to prevent the captain from taking him aboard. But you didn't. And now he's gone! And that's our finish! You're a confounded, blundering idiot! Perhaps now would be a good time to check out. Check out? Why not? Once Wheaton tells his story and they investigate your record, 47 marshals will be here to round us up, and you'll spend the rest of your days in a federal prison. Perhaps you're right. Well, I got some news, Helen. That big, handsome lad of yours looks quite natural behind bars. Judge, quite a mob of miners down at the jail. They seem to resent our locking up their boyfriend. You may have to send for those soldiers yet. You know I can't do that! Now, listen, Alec, I'm worried about Wheaton getting away. Perhaps we should lose no time in getting out. Take it easy, Judge, take it easy. Plenty of time to line our pokes. It'll be three months before Wheaton gets back. What's funny about that, baby? Nothing. My, we're a jolly crew, aren't we? Careful, now, Helen. I'm not gonna say anything, except that it's so much more fun making money the way we do, instead of slaving for it like those silly miners. I'm not sure that I like your attitude lately. Somehow you've acquired a distorted viewpoint. Brought about by what is known as "the miracle of love." Go on, tell us all about what a nice little community it was until we blew in and spoiled it all. Make it sound as sloppy as you want to. But that's how it is, and that's what we are, a cheap lot of spoilers! Let's not have any more of this sentimental taffy. But, Alec, suppose the miners do revolt? They blew out the front of the bank, didn't they? What's to prevent their doing the same thing to the jail and releasing Glennister before I bring him to trial? Perhaps you won't have to bring him to trial. What do you mean? Well, I think that'd be carrying things a bit too far. We've never had to resort to anything like murder. (DOOR OPENING) Picking a nice time to leave town, aren't you? Is there some reason why I shouldn't go now? I have things I want to get in Seattle. So you paid a triple fare to Captain Toombs for passage on his leaky old freighter to get there. Who told you that? Most of the men who patronize my place are my friends. Captain Toombs happens to be one of them. Does that tell you anything? I fail to see why it should interest me. If I wanted him to make room for a friend of mine, he'd do it. And if I should want him to cancel a passage, he'd do that, too. I want to know why you're running away, and from what. I'm not running away. You're lying! You've finished your job and now you're getting out! You made it possible for that cheap bunch of crooks to put Roy in jail, and now you're going to sneak away. It isn't so! Why should I want to hurt him? I... You what? Why did you come here? What is it to you if I leave? Isn't it plain enough why I want to go? Do you think I can stay here and see him... You're in love with him, aren't you? No. Well, what if I am? It's you he wants, if that's what you came here to find out. But if you're in love with him, why are you skipping out? A woman doesn't run out on the man she loves. She sticks with him, win or lose. I can't stay here and see him... I can't stay here, that's all. You can't stay here and see him what? They've got something framed up for that trial. What is it? There isn't gonna be any trial. There isn't going to be... You mean, they're gonna turn him loose, let him escape? But how? How are they gonna do it? When the deputy brings him his supper tonight, he's gonna let him escape out the back way. And outside they're gonna shoot him down while he makes his break. Is that it? I fought against it, but what could I do? Nothing. You're not the type. All you can do is run away and let them do what they want with him. What can I do to help? Keep your mouth closed. If you do, I'll see that you get on that boat. If you don't, you'll still leave town, but after I'm through with you. BRONCO: Why should I worry about what they're going to do to Glennister? So they'll shoot him in the back. What of it? You know how I feel about you. I've told you a thousand times. It's you or nobody, Cherry. Why should I do anything to help him? Now listen, Bronco. For you it's a matter of no one else will do, isn't it? Well... That's the way I feel about him. No one else will do. Understand? I'll make it five. Well, I'll see them. I've got two short. Three jacks. Well, that cleans me. I reckon I better go on with my chores. A little early for their supper, isn't it? I gotta feed them sometime. Excuse, please. Likem see Chinese consul. there ain't no Chinese consul nearer than Seattle? Or maybe you'd like to see him. Very good! You unlock door. I go Seattle. You talk like a foreigner. Hey, Glennister, pass me that tray, will you? Take a look out in the office and see what Thompson's doing. He's standing at the door looking out. Why? When I bring you your supper, I'll turn my back on you. You let me have it. Then you beat it out the back way. I'll leave the door open. SKINNER: I'm terribly sorry. I assure you, Miss Malotte... Mr. Skinner seems to be carrying an extra load tonight. So what's the trouble, Cherry? He been bothering the customers What's the matter with you, Skinner? Can't you carry it anymore? Carry it anymore? How dare you, sir? I shall prove the inconsistency of that remark by repairing to my customary retreat unassisted. My apologies to you, Miss Malotte. (MAN SPEAKING CHINESE) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Hello, Skinner. Good evening, Mr. Glennister. Putting drunks in jail's a little out of your line, isn't it, Cherry? Mmm-hmm. I had an idea that you might let me see a certain friend of mine. Glennister? Sorry, Cherry, it'd mean my job if I let you in. The court's orders. They certainly put a limit on a man, don't they? Easy on the punch. CHERRY: Roy! Roy! Not this way! It's a trick. Get out the front! Get into hiding and stay there until Wheaton comes back. Tonight we're taking back our mine, and then it's every man for himself. Wait up for me, will ya, sport? (GUN FIRING) Apparently everything came off on schedule. Yeah, so it seems. But it's still a nasty business. Maybe you'd better slip upstairs and sip a warm lemonade, before you break out in a rash of righteousness. Yes, I think I will. and let out a howl about negligence and all that stuff. Uh-huh. CHERRY: Mr. McNamara. Mr. McNamara. You probably heard what happened. I heard a few shots. He tried to get away and they shot him. They shot who? Glennister. Glennister? Bronco and I were taking Mr. Skinner to jail. We were there when he... Easy. Perhaps you'd better come in and rest a moment. No, I'd rather go to my place. Would you... Sure. Miss Cherry, I'm so glad to see you. There's been a big shooting down at the jail. Yes, we know all about it, Idabelle. You knows all about it? Somebody get shot or something? Glennister. Mr. Glennister? Lordy sakes! Get some brandy for Idabelle, in the kitchen there. Wake up, Idabelle. Do you hear me? Wake up! Do you hear me? Well, who put out them lights? Mr. Glennister! Nothing's happened to Mr. Glennister. He got away. But I have to keep McNamara here, and I don't want to be left alone with him. Now, close your eyes, quick! Thanks. Come on, Idabelle, have a little sip of this. (COUGHING) How'd I get back here in Georgia? Oh, good morning, folks. Hi, y'all. Now, you'll be all right, Idabelle. Ain't there something softer to lay on than this here floor? Mr. McNamara, would you help me put her on the couch? She thought the world of Mr. Glennister. Mr. Glennister! Now, now, come, Idabelle. Have another sip. Yes, I guess I would feel better once I gets me on that couch. Sure you don't like it here? I's positive, sir. Poor Mr. Glennister! He sure was a lovely man. Hey, Kelly! KELLY: Yeah? Got enough steam left to go? No, but it won't take long. Why? We're taking our mine back tonight, But, Roy, they've gone and built a barricade around that mine of yours. If you're figuring on crashing through, you're crazy. If it does, we'll buy you a new one. Now, get in there and get the steam going. As soon as Flapjack and the rest of them get here, we'll be set to go. Except this all could be a mistake, Roy. Maybe we ought to wait till Wheaton gets back from Seattle. Don't pretend like you're on the side of law and order. BANTY: Roy, Dex! Here we are! (MEN CLAMORING) Well, what's holding us back, huh? Set to go, men? ALL: Yeah! Now, wait a minute! Wait a minute! Open that gate! Open up there! Glennister broke jail, and he's gonna try to take the mine! Bar those gates! Come on, men, come on! Come on out and get your rifles! There's gonna be 30 or 40 armed deputies guarding that mine. Maybe some of us won't come back. If there's anybody here that isn't set for that kind of action, now's the time to speak up. (ALL YELLING) What we're doing tonight is gonna be warning to any crooks headed this way, that the pickings here are plenty tough. Now, get aboard, all of you. And that goes for you too, Dex. I'll take the front end. You heard what Kelly said. You're not gonna run that engine. Can't run itself, can it? How about it, Kelly? All ready to go. Only let me out of here. They're gonna pick you up with a soup spoon. What are you doing up here, Bronco? Get on back with the boys! Maybe I'd better stay here. I always wanted to ride up front. Here they come! Scatter, men, and keep low! When they smash through the gate, let them have it! Shoot them! Kill them! Let's crowd them! ALL: Yeah! Hey, Thompson! Yeah? You take charge here! Post guards and don't let anybody come within rifle shot. You hear? Yes, sir, I get you. Well, Roy, it looks like we got the old... Did you get your mine back? Yeah, we got her back, Bronco. (COUGHING) Still... I'd... I'd like to have been there at the finish, when you tie in with McNamara. McNAMARA: Would it be violating the privilege of a guest to ask for another bottle? CHERRY: Idabelle! Yessum, Miss Cherry, I is right here. Don't be scared. Bring another bottle of champagne. Yessum. I'll be right back. Good wine and a lovely woman. A made-to-order paradise. To us! You were right, Helen, absolutely right. I wish I had listened to you before. If you want to catch that boat, you better stop talking. He's over at the Northern with the Malotte woman, But Glennister's taken back his mine. Taken back... Well, who cares about mines? We're getting out of here. Not without me! I'm going with you! Wait, I'll pack my things. You better hurry. We're not waiting for anybody! What's your hurry, Judge? You're not going anywhere. STILLMAN: Now, listen, Glennister, you got your mine back. That closes the case. You ought to be satisfied. That's enough, now, Betsy. Now, see here, Glennister! You're gonna stay here with us until the real law comes to Nome. Dex, you and the boys take care of him. Come on, Judge. Where's McNamara, Helen? He's at the Northern with... He's at the Northern. Goodbye, Roy. Come on, sit over here. There's no need to hurry things, is there? But you've kept the room between us ever since I brought you home, and I don't like it. I've had quite a shock tonight, you know. But that's all behind us now. The king is dead. Long live the king. You know, tonight's been a long time getting here. I've been waiting for it since the first time I saw you in my office. Nothing's ever so worthwhile as it seems beforehand, Mr. McNamara. No? I'll chance that. Listen, you can lead those sourdoughs around like children but I happen to be a man that gets what he wants. From now on, it's you and me. You walked right into the trap, and I might as well spring it. Trap? Yes. Your jailbreak didn't pan out. Glennister's still alive, and by now he has his mine back. Your visit here has served its purpose, Mr. McNamara. Get out! Get out? Get out of the way, Cherry. I haven't got a gun on me, Glennister. No? Then we'll do it the hard way. (PEOPLE YELLING) Why don't you separate them? Come on, let's break it up! No, you don't! Let them fight it out. Let that be a lesson to you. (WOMAN SCREAMING) WOMAN: Stop them! WOMAN: Stop! Stop it! (ALL YELLING) Roy, that's enough. Come on. Leave something for the law to work on. Let me go, Dex. Come on, boys. Drinks are on us. (ALL CHEERING) MAN: That's the best fight I've seen. Roy. Roy. Hi, sport. Sorry I helped wreck your place. Forget it. But you said you wouldn't allow any brawls around here unless they were over you. Remember? Yes. But I also said, "Anything you can win, you can collect."
