(objects clanking) (light buzzing) (switch clicks) (dramatic music) - [Zeke] Special Forces, Special Forces, Special Forces, reaching out to any Colonials, reaching out to any... (engine roaring) (bright, brooding music) Special Forces, Zeke, reaching out to any reaching to any, reaching out to any Colonials. I'm the last surviving, I'm the last surviving, I'm the last surviving. This is day 20,000. I'm the last surviving member of my squadron. This is day 20,802. Oh, wait. 20,803. The Exiles have taken everything. Earth is in ruins. If there are any Colonials out there, please respond. (dramatic music) (electricity arcing) (calm music) (dramatic music) (cheerful music) (singer vocalizing) (Silas snoring) - [Spark] Sunshine! Sunshine! (chuckles) Still not waking up, huh? Well, I've got something for you. - Hey! Hey, stop! - [Spark] I asked nicely, but you didn't wake up. - Spark! I will end you! - [Spark] You've programmed me to wake you up at approximately 6:00 AM every morning, yet you still sleep in like a teenager. If I was born your parent, I'd show you the meaning of an- - Alarm clocks! - [Spark] I'll show you something alarming. (suspenseful music) (Silas grunting) Your move. - I will end you! (grunts) Dad? - Hey, son. Uh, wow. You look, uh, interesting. - Hey, sweetie. Oh, I think your hair looks cute. - Ah. - Yeah. - Uh, Dad, like, why did we allow our robots to have so much personality? - [Cyrus] That robot, Spark, is there to keep you disciplined, son. - Eugh. More like a babysitter. - Listen, your role in this mission, it will determine the fate of humanity. (whimsical music) - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got this, Pops. - Sweetie, how are you getting on with Allie and Jesse? - Uh. (scoffs) - What? - Look, we're kind of in the middle of something. Just... - All right. - [Cyrus] As I was saying, this mission also determines whether or not you will become a full-fledged Colonial. - All Right! I heard you. Don't worry, guys. Okay, I promise, when I land, I'll send you a full, detailed report of my discoveries, okay? So, uh... - Son? - Tell Mom I love her, and I'm on the way to the hangar for inspection. - [Cyrus] Honey, do you know where... - Dad? - I don't know. Do you you swipe right. - Dad? - I win! - Whoa! (Spark buzzing) Spark! No! No! (electricity arcing) (door whooshes) (cheerful music) - What's going on in here? - Are we done? - Um, Allie and Jesse. - Are you good? - [Spark] Well, more like babysitter. - All right, Spark? - [Spark] I make us look good. - So before landing, a full inspection of the XJ2 must be completed according to Section 267, Subsection 45. - Question. - No. Um, also, I've done the liberty of preparing your MLWs. - What's an MLW? - Oh my God, okay. Mission log watch. - Does it come with a built-in alarm clock that doesn't float around? - [Spark] Does it come with a human that enjoys robot urine? - (sighs) Can we stay focused children, okay? We're about to enter Earth's orbit, and that means we graduate, complete the mission, become full-fledged Colonials, and you are not screwing it up up for me. - I've taken the liberty of developing a weapon for the XJ2 that's made of Martian element. - All right. - Right? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay. - Okay. - So that means she's ready to go, right? - Ready to go. - Inspection over! (suspenseful music) Does it have a cup holder? - [Allie] Yeah. The only thing she's missing is a pilot. - So our weapons, um, (clears throat) they can, like, totally eliminate Exile forces, right? - Let's hope it doesn't come to that, but obviously. - Great. - So besides the mission, be careful where you- (impact thuds) (Allie groans) - Whoa! (objects clattering) What's going on? - That, my friends, was the shockwave of a solar flare. - [Spark] Before the ship went offline, I tapped into the ship's sensory system, and it turns out we just flew right into a hidden EMP barrier of sorts. (suspenseful music) - Let's get to the command room and figure out what's actually going on. Silas? - Uh- - Let's go. - Everybody, just, you know, stay calm. Let's not jump- (impact thuds) (Allie groans) - That was not an EMP! That was a ship attacking us! (suspenseful music) (engine roaring) (electricity arcing) - Is this thing ready to fly? - Ready as it'll ever be. - All right. I'm taking her out. Everyone, to your stations! Pronto! (suspenseful music) - Spark? - [Spark] Silas? - We've got a love/hate relationship, but I- - [Spark] Well, that makes one of us. (suspenseful music continues) - Bet you wish you had a suit like this. - [Spark] Bet you wish you hadn't shrunk your jacket. - It looks like the EMP disabled most of our ship's controls. - Ah! Our shields are completely down! - Yeah? Not only that, but, (grunts) we have no control to ship's trajectory. - What are we gonna do about the rogue ship? - The only thing we can do. We have to send Silas out to intercept. (dramatic music) (explosion booming) (Silas screaming) - [Silas] Help! Help! - We just got hit again! - Yeah, they just hit the starboard side. That's where Silas is. - Silas! Silas! You good? You good? - [Silas] I can't stop spinning! This suit's about to become a vomit comet! - Can you make it to the XJ2? - [Silas] Uh, uh, I think so. - [Spark] Help! Whoa! (Silas yelling) (Spark yelling) - Come on! What's wrong with this junker? Nothing's working. - [Spark] Do you even have your license? - Come on! - Did you type in the authorization code? (Silas yells) I think that EMP might've done her in. - Ah, there has to be some way to spark this junker into life. - [Spark] Don't you even... (Silas grunts) Whoa! Whoa! (Silas grunts) (electricity zapping) - Yes! - [Spark] If I knew you were gonna make that move... (Silas woohoo!) - We are in business, baby! (engines whirring) (Silas woohoo!) (Jesse woohoo!) - I told you she was state of the art. - Uh, I hate to crash your party, but, uh, we're about to enter Earth's gravitational pull. Once we enter there, there's no escaping. (dramatic music) (brooding music) Uh, should we jump in with Silas? Jess? Jess? Should we jump in with Silas? - I think we're out of time. (dramatic music) (torpedo whooshes) (suspenseful music) (sad music) (soft, brooding music) (tense, foreboding music) (thunder cracking) (binoculars whirring) (water splashes) (Silas groaning) - You're alive. Darn. - You! Did you hit me with that, that ship? - What? - Huh? - What's going on down there, Zoe? - Well, he's not dead, unfortunately. Who's not dead? Who are you talking to? Huh? - Who is he? Is he an Exile? - [Zoey] Doubtful? Are you sniffing dirt? - [Thomas] You don't think he's a... - Don't say it. - Colonial? (brooding music) - [Zoey] No, there's no way this little twerp could be one of them. - One of who? - What's your name, soldier? - Uh... I, uh... I don't know. - Well, usually soldiers' names are written on the dog tag. - Silas? - Good. Glad you figured out your name. Now, do you even know where you're at? - I'm sure you can tell me. (binoculars whirring) - I want you to listen closely, all right? You see that smoke coming off your ship there? Hmm? That can be seen for miles. (binoculars whirring) (tense, foreboding music) - Zoey, we might have company coming. Can you wrap it up down there? (suspenseful music) - What do you see? - It's an Exile drone. Get out of there now! - Copy that. We'll leave now. - [Thomas] You better make it back, Zoey. - Hey! Where are you going? Hey, where are you going? (Zoey sighs) - They're coming. We need to get outta here quickly. - Who is they? - The Exiles. You wanna live? I suggest you come with me. - What, come with you? The one who threw water over my face? (suspenseful music continues) - Get in! (dramatic music) (Silas groaning) - I'm going as fast as I can. (groans) Man, I hate this thing. Do you even know how to fly this POSJ? - POSJ? - Yeah, piece of space junk. (plasma whooshing) (engine whirring) (Silas yells) (Silas screaming) (dramatic music) (metal clanks) (Silas screams) - [Silas] I'm fine, you're, fine, we're fine. - [Zoey] Will you be quiet? (engine chugging) (photon torpedo whooshes) (explosion booming) (Silas screaming) - [Zoey] Hold on, spaceman! (explosion booming) (Silas screaming) (dramatic music continues) (Silas laughs) - Hold on! We're getting of the main road! - No, no, no! This isn't working! (screams) That's a wall. Wall!!! (lasers zapping) (explosion booming) - Know how to use one of these, soldier? You're a soldier, right? - Yeah. Yeah, sure. Die! Die! Die! Die! Hey! - Give me that. (explosion booming) It wasn't that hard. (explosion booming) (engine chugging) (engine whooshing) (calm, brooding music) (ramp clanks) (dramatic music) - Cyrus, this is absurd. We're the most advanced civilization in the galaxy, and we can't even get a signal through to our son. He may be in danger. - Let's not jump to conclusions, honey. I'm sure Silas is fine. - You don't know that. - I do know that. He is piloting the most technologically-advanced ship in our fleet. Defense systems are, they're impenetrable. There's no possible way anything could happen to him. Besides, he's with Allie and Jesse. Those two are the top of their class. - Who only graduated last week. Cyrus, are you even listening to me? - What would you have me do, Kelli? - Send someone after them. (Cyrus scoffs) You're the commander-in-chief. Do something. - I can't do anything! Not without the committee's approval. - So? What, we just do nothing? What if the Exiles captured him? - Honey, like humanity, we have no idea as to the whereabouts of the Exiles. Now, that also means that we have no reason to think that there's an active threat. - Cyrus, please. Please. - I'll talk to the committee. Okay? - [Kelli] Do you really think he's okay? - [Cyrus] I wouldn't have sent our son halfway across the galaxy if I didn't think he was ready. (Zumbi speaking in foreign language) - Now you belong to my tribe. (Zumbi speaking in foreign language) Yeah, all the bad spirits, gone, gone, gone. Chase them away! (drum rattling) Wait! Stay! Lets play dirt. Yeah! Grow, grow, grow. (indistinct) And over there. And a little bit on yourself. And share. Share, share. (engine roaring) (dramatic music) Grow, grow, grow. (Zumbi yells) - Hey! Come back! Hey, guys! Wait up! Wait for me. Oh! Oh! (vase shatters) I'm sorry. (engine chugging) Zoey! Zoey, wait for me! - Bam. For something so primitive, it sure hauls asteroid. - I need you to behave. You're about to meet the leader of the Resistance. (brooding music) - General. Nice to finally meet you. Hey! - Who have you dragged in this time, Zoey? - General! General! You won't believe the fireball this guy came riding in on. He must've been going mach 30 when he crashed into the city. We found him chilling half dead against his ship, and Zoey's all like, "Oh, we gotta go check him out." But I was like, "Nah, you should proceed with caution." You know? - Thomas. - But then this drone came and started shooting nukes at us. - Thomas! - But did I say you came from the sky? I knew they'd come back. I knew it. - I'm sure your story holds truth, on the truth, Thomas. - Who? Who exactly is "they?" (dramatic music) - [Zoey] Don't say it. Don't say it. - Colonials. Hello. - Colonials? - Seems as though that crash has jogged his memory, General. - You don't need that mask in here, Zoey. Take it off. Now, I'm glad you all made it back here safely, but now we need to get to the bottom of this situation. (bright, ethereal music) That Exile drone came in very quickly. They must've wanted to recover whatever crashed there. You. Hey, I'm talking to you. - General. - What happened before the crash? - Honestly, I, uh, I couldn't tell you. - He couldn't even tell me his own name, if it hadn't been for that dog tag. - He's a Colonial. It's obvious. - So what is your name? - Uh... Silas. - Did we recover any intel from his ship, Zoey? - No, unfortunately not. We didn't have enough time. The only thing we recovered was Silas. - Ma'am, I received news on the crashed vessel. (ominous music) - All right, listen up. Resistance scouts are reporting that your ship was taken to this quadrant. Now, we don't know what they want. Zoey, Thomas, I want you to infiltrate the Exile base and recover that ship. And this must be done under the radar. That means leaving that noisy vehicle if yours behind and going in on foot. - But we can't. - But even if we get past the guards and reach the ship, how do we fly back? - That's precisely why I'm having you take Silas. Hopefully, being near that ship will jog his memory. - Hopefully? Good, good. (clears throat) - You want us to risk our lives for this random guy we just met? - Zoey, every day we don't act, more humans are forced into slavery, or worse. The ship could be the key to everything. - I understand. Let's go, Thomas. (whimsical music) - Yeah, just breeze past the Exile guards and reach the ship that nobody knows how to fly but the mindless alien that doesn't even know his own name. Yeah, sure. Go, go, go, go. Go, go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. (bright, mysterious music) There's someone I know who may be able to help figure out where you came from. However, we haven't had contact with him for some time now. - I'll try anything at this point. - His name is Zeke. He used to play a major role in the Resistance, but he dropped out of society, and he's taken steps to keep it that way. - Where can I find this Zeke? - The last known location of his residence. The man is very dangerous, Silas. Who's to save if he even still thinks of the Resistance as an ally? - Thank you, General. What about Thomas and Zoey? - Think of this as a reward for completing your task. Once you've covered your ship, feel free to seek him out. (bright, brooding music) (whimsical music) - You, come here. (speaks in foreign language) Yes, you. Come here, quick! Come here! (suspenseful music) (engine whooshing) (gate clanking) (computer whirring) (electricity zaps) (whimsical music) (door whirs) (bright, mysterious music) (heart beating) (door whirs) (computer beeping) (ominous music) - [Grom] Raven, what have you uncovered? - The technology is of Colonial design, as I presumed. - [Grom] Yes. Excellent. What else? - According to the bot's data log, the ship belongs to a Colonial named Silas. (Grom laughs) - [Grom] That's not just any Colonial. That's Silas, son of Cyrus, commander of the Colonial forces. - Yes. What would you have me do? - [Grom] Go to Section 45 and await my commands. I'm sending Lockjaw and Flatline to help assist. - And the droid? - Leave it. You have what you need already. Now go. - As you command. - [Grom] And bring me that Colonial. (laughs) (dramatic music) (Grom laughs) (brooding music) - So what's up with Zoey? - What do you mean? - Like, from the start, she's treated me like a pile of dirt. - I mean, it's not you necessarily. It's kind of just how we were raised with the Resistance. - So what about you? I mean, (chuckles) like, why did she tolerate you? Are you two like... - No. No! It's not like that. We're basically brother and sister at this point. - Could've fooled me, I mean, your personalities are vastly different. - I'd ask you a question, but, uh... - I hope it comes back to me eventually. Aren't you a little young to be venturing off on your own? I mean, where are your parents? - Well, we both kind of think of Rhea as our parent figure. Zoey and I, our parents both were sold into slavery by the Exiles when we were really young. I don't know where they are or if they're even still alive. Like, I don't even know who my parents are, if that makes you feel any better. It is what it is. Even then, I- - Hey, what are you two wingnuts blabbering about? - Uh, nothing. - Actually, Thomas was just telling me about your embarrassing ex-boyfriends. - Oh, is that so? I'll tell you what's embarrassing. Watching you trying to shoot down that Exile drone. - Well, uh, you know, Silas was telling me how he much preferred you without your mask on. - Oh. - No. No, I mean, you removed your mask, and you had, like, she had dirt, okay? You had a lot of dirt all over your face, and I was like, you know? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Are you sure you weren't worried about the dirt on my face? Speaking of dirt, um, did you guys see the crazy, guy, like playing in the dirt? - Yeah, that guy got me with his voodoo games, too. - Yeah, I couldn't move. Like, he kept me there for hours. - Jokes aside now, guys. This mission is extremely crucial to the Resistance. Now, if it were up to me, I'd be in and out of that base before you could blink, but I don't know how to fly that ship. - Yeah? Well, what makes you think I know how? - Hey, don't ask me. That's on Rhea. I mean, you're obviously inexperienced. You don't even know how to fire a weapon. You're just a nobody that's gonna end up getting us killed. - Come on, Zoe. - No, No, this isn't a joke. The Exiles will kill us the first chance they get, and we don't need this anchor holding us down. I'm going to bed. - Um, I'm sorry about that, man. But hey, you know, maybe she's right. We've got a busy day tomorrow. Let's get some rest, yeah? (dramatic music) (ominous music) (heart beating) - Silas! - No! (voice echoing) (soft, brooding music) (dramatic music) (door creaking) - He's gone. - We can't find Silas anywhere. He must have left last night. What are we gonna do now? - Let him go. - Let him go? He's a freaking pilot. - Colonials wouldn't have changed their ship controls too drastically. And if anyone can figure out to fly their ship, it's you. - She's right. Weren't you just complaining about how he was a risk anyway? - Hey, we're out of options and time. I need you both to get moving, now. Go. (dramatic music) (ominous music) - [Cyrus] No communication has been received from the Delta One in days. We need to send another ship immediately and investigate what happened. - [Senator Lucius] Oh, that's outrageous! - [Senator Shannon] You already convinced us to send one ship on this goose chase, but why would we send another? - [Senator Damon] Not to mention, we don't even know if there's anything wrong with Delta Squad to begin with. - [Senator Lucius] They're no more than greedy viruses consuming everything in their path. - [Cyrus] Turning our back on those less fortunate? Have you forgotten from where you came? - The Earthlings are committed to the Exiles now. Breaking communication with us just confirms where their loyalty lies. - And let them revert back to the dark ages? There are humans that need our help. - We cannot afford to put any more Colonial lives in danger. - [Cyrus] I will not put up with this any longer! - [Judge Jameson] Order! Order, I say! Order! - Yes, it is true that we funded this mission and gave it our precious resources. But I want all of this committee to remember that the mission was voluntary, and one of the brave soldiers who volunteered so valiantly was Cyrus's own son. Now, I do not assume that any member of this senate is going to jump at the opportunity to send one of your own family members into this situation. So I say we listen to Cyrus, because Cyrus has given more to this mission than any of you, and he must be heard. All right, we understand what needs to be discussed. Cyrus, we'll congregate. We'll discuss the matter. Tomorrow we'll have an answer. Until then. (bright, dramatic music) (mysterious, foreboding music) - Hey! Hey! Hey, you there! Hey! Hey! Hey! (wood splits) (Silas yells) (suspenseful music) Sorry! I'm sorry! No! No! No! No! - Where do you come from, boy? - Uh, the sky. I think. - You know how to play charades? I lost my hearing in the old war. Well, most of it, anyway. It wasn't so bad when I had my late wife Elizabeth with me. (laughs) I'll tell you, I'll tell you, that woman, she could talk an elephant's ear off. Like a record player, just going around and around and around. (sighs) I miss her. - I pictured you being more of a- - You know, now it's just me and Morgan, and he don't say much. - Wait. Morgan? - I can't hear you. - (clears throat) Morgan? - I can't hear you, and I don't go in for that sign language crap, either. Not with these sausages. Come on, look at 'em. (laughs) - Wow! - Hey! You see something that looks like it doesn't come from this world, do yourself a favor and don't touch it, got it? I lost my arm during the war protecting the humans against those Exiles. - Exiles? - I'll never forget the witch who took my arm, cut it off. Well, get your pen and paper. Let's get to it. - Uh... Oh. Okay. So your hand? - It got taken. - Yeah. Uh... Who took it? - I know you can't remember anything, but are you sure you're not a professor? - Professor? - Yeah, 'cause you got a PhD in busted my balls. She was an assassin. Did all Grom's dirty work. - Grom? - Don't you know anything? The Exiles, Silas. The Exiles, they are led by Grom. He is a very dangerous individual. He used to also be a very powerful Colonial, and he used to be my friend. Look, Silas, there was a time when humans, they thrived during the Space Age, and the best of the best, the elite, they became known as the Colonials. But they couldn't, they couldn't handle the technology, some of them, and, well, they got engulfed in greed. eventually they were cast out of the colony. They were banished like Lucifer from Heaven. And they became known as the Exiles. - What happened to the, um, Exiles? - With nowhere else to go, they made the long voyage back to Earth. And when they got there, they took their new power and they waged war on mankind. It was decided by the Colonials that we would send a small force, myself included, were sent to intervene. When we got there, we were pushed back almost immediately. No choices, no options. I was left behind. So now you know why I'm here. But why are you here? - Well, I, um, I was, uh, here by Rhea. (Zeke laughs) Rhea. - Yeah, there's a name I haven't thought about in a very long time. - Yeah? - She's a special one, ain't she? But why did she send you here? - Well, I, um, I crash... I crash landed on Earth. What happened or who... (dramatic music) - Well, I'll tell you one thing, that dog tag you wearing, that doesn't come from Earth. (chuckles) I'll tell you what, you showed me yours so I'll show you mine. Lookie-lookie. I got one just like you. - You serious? - Yeah. - So I'm a spaceman sitting with another spaceman, just sipping tea in the middle of, um... Uh... How long have you been here? - Well, about 60 years. - 60 years? How did that happen? How old are you? - Ah. (chuckles) Well, come the next, come the next winter solstice, I'll be 127 years old. I've still got some lead left in my pencil, too. You, me, Morgan, (chuckles) we're all Colonials. - Wait. We're Colonials? - Mm-hmm. Where's, where's Morgan? - Morgan. Morgan! (chuckles) - Morgan! - You know what? I think you waited long enough, too. I think it's about to have you meet him. Hey, Morgan! I got someone I want you to meet! Ah, stay right there. Stay right there. Morgan, I'm coming! (chuckles) Morgan! Where are you? Silas? - Yeah? - I want you to meet Morgan. (whimsical music) (Zeke chuckles) Yeah. Morgan, this here is Silas. Yeah. Like I said, he don't say much. What's the matter, Morgan? Cat got your tongue? Yeah. He's a good boy. That's Silas. (dramatic music) - Oh, get down. Get down. (suspenseful music) - [Thomas] Yup, we're gonna die. - We've been in this situation before. - (chuckles) Okay. This place is oozing with Exiles, Zoe. How do you even propose we get to the ship? (suspenseful music continues) - Rock. The rock. Rock. The rock. Come on. Come on. Hurry up. (rock clatters) - Huh? (rifle whirring) - Come on. (tense, brooding music) - Whoa! - [Soldier] How did you get here? Stop them. (suspenseful music) - All right, you draw the ax above your head, you focus on your target, nothing but the target, and then you strike without thought. There you go! Ha-ha! Yeah, just might have a chance of getting up this planet after all. (Silas sighs) What's going on? (whimsical music) - Uh... - Well, go. It's a desert. I mean, go anywhere. I do. (engine whirring) (urine splashing) (tense, brooding music) - Zeke! (Silas groans) (dramatic music) (Silas yells) (punches thudding) - Raven! (dramatic music continues) (brooding music) (whip whirring) (whip zapping) (Zeke groans) (suspenseful music) (blaster zaps) (Zeke grunts) (blasters zapping) Morgan, how about a little bit of help? All right, fine, I'll do it myself. (Zeke yells) (Zeke growls) - Kill him! (blasters zapping) (suspenseful music) (Zeke grunts) (Silas screams) (punches thudding) (kick thuds) (Zeke groans) - What? Come on now. - Zeke! (Zeke screams) (man thuds) - Did you see that, Morgan? Yeah, just like we practiced. (blade clangs) (suspenseful music) (brooding music) (Raven grunts) (Silas groans) (heart beating) (siren wailing) (suspenseful music) (blaster zaps) (explosion booms) (door whirs) (electricity arcing) (door whirs) (door whirs) - [Soldier] Huh? Hm (door whirs) (suspenseful music continues) (door whirs) - Did you see that? Did you see that? Did you see what's going on out there? They have an army. They have fighter ships. They have robots. - Shh! Be quiet! (Thomas moaning) Shh! (Thomas moaning) - Just- - Behind you! Behind you! (Zoey grunts) (soldier thuds) (blaster zaps) (tense, brooding music) - Let's go. (door whirs) (Spark beeping) - Zoey, we need to get out of Mordor now. - I'm working on it, man. My adrenaline is off the charts. (Spark whirring) - Hey, hey, isn't it the robot from earlier? (dramatic music) - Let's follow him. Come on. - Are you serious? What is going on with that wonder ball? Look. He's stealing that ship. (engines whirring) (laser zaps) (dramatic music continues) (blasters zapping) - Hey, look. That door is still open. Come on, let's go. (blasters zapping) (gears rattling) (explosion booming) (blasters zapping) - [Spark] (chuckles) Sure would like to see R2-D2 pull something off like that. (sighs) Uh, something doesn't seem right with my circuits. Feels like someone or something's tampered with my body. - Did you see that? He just murdered half an army, murdered! Why would we get on this ship with this maniac robot? - Thomas, look at me, okay? I need you to calm down. - He doesn't even have arms. How is he flying the ship? - He's obviously not with the Exiles, since he just massacred them. - Yeah, but what's stopping him from massacring us? - We can't stay here forever. We need to go talk to him. - Huh-uh-nu-nu-nu-no - Shh! We need to do something. - No, I do not wanna go over there. - The option is to go talk to him, unless you wanna jump off the ship. - Okay. Fine. - [Spark] Huh, I wonder what happened to that doofus Silas? I swear, if he's gotten himself killed, Cyrus will have me formatted. (object clanks) (tense music) Who's there? Eh, probably another space rat. (tense, brooding music) - Did you see that? I can't do this, Zoe. That is a devil bot. - Let's go. Hey, robot. (everyone screaming) - [Spark] How did you kids get in here? - Zoey. It was her fault. - We saw you take out that Exile army, and your ship, it was our only chance of escape, so we hopped on. We're sorry. We're sorry. - I don't even know how or why I was at that base, but I'd never forget what an Exile looks like. - We saw you in a room, taken apart. - Could explain why I have no recollection after the crash. - You were on this ship when it crashed? - I was designed by Colonial engineers on Mars to serve with the Delta One Regiment. - I knew it! I told you that Silas is a Colonial. - Yes, Silas. Do you know where he is? - I think there's someone you need to meet. (engine whirring) - Cyrus, can I talk to you? Now look, I know this must be a very difficult time for you, but I just want you to know, I'm gonna do everything in my power in there to find out what happened to that mission. - Thank you, Tobias. I appreciate that. - Now look, I know you were a soldier, and I know, whatever the outcome, you're gonna be all right. How's Kelli doing? I'm sure this is hard on her. - She's, um, she's strong. I think she blames me for this. Well, frankly, I don't fault her for doing so. - Cyrus, we all saw the validity in the mission. You cannot blame yourself. - I'll stop blaming myself when we get them home safely. What do you think is gonna happen in there? - I don't know. I'll tell you, in the time that I've spent with these pontificators, sometimes, just by accident, they do the right thing. Now, I understand that they all see the validity in the coexistence with the humans, and I don't think any one of them would stand in the way of you finding out what happened to your son, but I just don't know. - Well, one way to find out. - Okay. (indistinct) (tense, droning music) - On behalf of all the representatives of this committee, we've decided not to aid the Delta One crew, nor the humans still living on Earth. The risk is too great to send any more Colonials into the unknown. - [Cyrus] They said no. - What? - They said no. They denied the request. - What would the Exiles do to him when they get their hands on him. What will they do to him? (door whirs) - Cyrus, Kelli, I'm sorry to interrupt. Cyrus, you need to come with me right now. (dramatic music) (engine whooshing) - Tell Rhea exactly what you told us on the ship, bot. - [Spark] Shall we do this the proper way? My name's Spark. I was built by the Colonials for the purpose of serving Silas and assisting the Delta One Regiment on this mission. - What exactly is, or was, your mission? - [Spark] The Colonials haven't received any communications from the humans on Earth for 50 years. - Well, we could say the same about you. - Yeah, you're the ones who cut off all communications with us. - [Spark] Our mission was to investigate what was causing the interference and report back to Cyrus. - Who is Cyrus. - [Spark] Well, you already met Silas, apparently. Cyrus is his father, and also the leader of the Colonial colony. - Have you sent back any distress signals? - [Spark] I've made many attempts, but haven't received a response. (door whirs) (tense, brooding music) (blade clangs) - I think I know what may have happened to Silas. This weapon belonged to an assassin known as Raven. I believe she has something to do with his disappearance. - [Zoey] So we can assume that Silas is dead? - My fear is that the Exiles had figured out exactly who Silas is. They've taken him to a space station between Earth and the Moon. - Why would they take him there? - Because the space station has always been out of our reach, until now. (tense, brooding music continues) (door whirs) - I told you, I don't know anything about Colonials. Where are you taking me? (Silas groans) (door whirs) - Remove your clothes. - No. No! (blaster zaps) (blaster zaps) (machines droning) (tense, brooding music) - I figured a Colonial would be much larger. But here you are, no bigger than the average human. I know everything about you thanks to your little droid. You're gonna wish you never came to Earth, Colonial. (tense, brooding music) (door whirs) (door whirs) (Grom laughs) - [Grom] Did you really think you could come to Earth without us knowing? The stars shine upon the Exiles today. The son of the great Colonial leader is now in our possession. A Colonial present in this very station that powers our barrier. Nothing gets through our electromagnetic barrier, and nothing gets out, as you shall soon learn. (laughs) You will suffer every second of every day until your people give us back what they've stolen. Silas, you hold the very thing I've desired since the beginning, knowledge, knowledge that only the Red Planet can produce. Colonials are bigger, stronger, ageless. That planet fuels your evolution. Your mind is the gateway to the revolution. However, we need to get back those precious memories, and this tank will do exactly that. (laughs) Once I finish off what remains of the Resistance and take complete control of Earth, I'll begin preparations for the Mars campaign. The Colonials will be at my mercy. (laughs) (tense, brooding music continues) (suspenseful music) - Another mission with little hope of coming out alive. I swear, Rhea doesn't care what happens to us. - Don't worry. I picked up a handful of rocks just in case we need 'em. - [Spark] Wait, rocks? What? - You don't wanna know. Trust me. (bright, brooding music) (radio chattering) - [Spark] I wonder if Silas would but be happy to see me? - No way to know. The last time we saw him, he couldn't even remember his own name. - Apparently that crash removed his memories. - [Spark] Great. Maybe now he'll start listening to me. - Zoey! Thomas! There's a large Exile force approaching rapidly. We don't have the numbers to counter their attack. Finish this as fast as possible. We're outta time. (dramatic music) (engines whirring) (door whirs) - [Grom] You are to return to Earth and rendezvous with the rest of our forces. March for the Resistance base at dawn. Eliminate them all. - And Silas? - [Grom] Let the chamber do its work. He cannot escape. - As you command. (tense, brooding music) (engines whooshing) - [Spark] What are you doing, Zoey? Silas is on that space station. - Oops! - There's more fighters coming out of that station! (crane whirring) (engine whooshing) We're all gonna die! (tense, brooding music continues) (glass cracking) (glass cracking) (glass cracking) (glass shattering) (water splashing) (Silas gasping) (dramatic music) (Silas yells) (dramatic music continues) (engine roaring) (engines whooshing) (blasters zapping) Watch out! Shoot them! (blasters zapping) (blasters zapping) Go! Go! Go, go, go, go, go! - Shut up! I'm trying! - [Spark] If we keep this up, we won't make it. (suspenseful music) (energy beams buzzing) (object clatters) (armor whirring) - [Thomas] This is it! We're done for! - Shut up! - [Silas] Guys? Hello? - Silas! - Silas? - [Spark] You're alive! I can't believe it! I'm not getting formatted! - [Silas] Uh, guys? We may not have much time. We need to hurry. (Silas grunting) (soldier screaming) (energy zapping) I don't we know where I'm going. I need an exit plan! - [Spark] Out of the way, human. I'll handle this nonsense. - Think you can do better? - [Spark] I'll take out these Exiles and swing around and pick you up. Find an exit. - [Silas] Easy for you to say. (suspenseful music continues) (engines roaring) (blasters zapping) (blasters zapping) (engines whooshing) - [Spark] Ah! (blasters zapping) (blasters zapping) Whoa! (blasters zapping) (Spark yells) (blasters zapping) (explosion booming) (Spark laughs) (blasters zapping) Ah! (Thomas yells) (dramatic music) Thomas, hit the button. - What button? - [Spark] The one over there. (energy buzzing) (Thomas screams) (blast zaps) (explosion booming) (glass shattering) (Silas screaming) - Grab him! Hurry! - I'm on it! (ramp whirring) (Silas thuds) (helmet clattering) - You're alive! You son of a gun! - No! (Thomas grunts) - I can't believe it! - Yeah. - Wow! (laughs) - Yeah. Get off me. - Sorry. Sorry. (Silas groans) - [Spark] Remember me? How could I forget a floating alarm clock? - [Spark] I'll show you something alarming. - Hey! Spark! (water splashing) - [Spark] How is that for an alarm clock? (Zoey and Thomas laughing) (bright, pensive music) - [Silas] Colonials, if you're receiving this message, please take in with great caution. The Exiles destroyed my ship, and I'm sad to report that they took the lives of both poor Allie and Jesse. Grom is alive, and now more dangerous than ever. The Exiles planted an electric barrier that blocked all communication in and out. The Resistance are extremely outmatched. Their lives, no, our lives, depend on the help of the Colonials. So please, I urge you, send help before it's too late.
