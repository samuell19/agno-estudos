The gray wolf reigned on these woods. Indigenous people would love it like a god. European settlers arrived, they chased the wolves. They pushed them to the North, and massacred them. We thought they were gone from these regions. But they come back. They know they are at home. They are fighters, just like you. You fought today ... like a wolf. The park needs this energy. You are hungry ? You want to eat a piece, little she-wolf? It's cro? Eh, huh? I do not like it either. And here, lunch is served. For what happened. We did our best. Nobody will know it.

That of the new Chelsea, it's her. It's been years no one went there. Then ... Mr. Ranger, thanks for all you've done. But Chelsea has a good on this mountain, OK?

Nobody wanted after the assassination of my uncle. - Murder ? - A wolf attack. He put it in pieces. Gnant ... You never talked about wolves. There are lots of weird animals in the corner. Like wolves, bears, sometimes we even see ... Lions, tigers! And they are attracted to the wastes, so we should put away. And by the blood, you should heal your old face, Jerk. OK, Michael Myers. There is a room. Yeah man, it's a house ... What was he doing alone your uncle ? He was a writer. He wanted to be alone. I spent my summer here, just him and me. Only one here and I'm shooting. We sat in these armchairs and he was reading me his stories before going to sleep. And... one day, he is ... he went hunting and he did not come back. We found it in the woods, the face torn off. Shit. Dude, you can not smoke here. How is it? Why ? It's just that my uncle was smoking under the porch, so ... - It is not serious. - Stop.

I did not recognize you. Pink hair troubled me. You came back. After all these years ... You came back. You remember me ? It's pretty confusing. I can understand. It was a long time ago. My hair is different too. They became gray. I should test the rose. How did you end up with these people? It was not the kind of the girl I remember. I have to go. Meet your friends I left a moment ago. They come from the city. They are not used to nature. They should not be doing everything. No. No, indeed. Well, if you ... If you need something. If I can do anything. Or if you just want ... Traner. Go on a hike, talk. I can show you nice places. Short. My cottage is at the top of the mountain. Next to the watchtower. We can see it from here.

Take good care of her. Go! Are you sure there is a phone? There was none at your uncle's. There is a radio. I remember a radio. - Have you ever been there? - Yes, little. The guard was already working when I came on vacation. He helped me, after the story with my uncle. It comes from there. What? What are you talking about ? Your thing with the authority. Excuse me ? Your reflex to go see a guy in uniform, as soon as it turns out badly. - Go ahead. - No problem, the scout will save us. How many dressings will be needed to sew up his skull? You want to leave it to empty oneself of one's blood? And if we found the cowboy, to save us? She does not look good. Maybe a little more? I think that's help. It's going to go. Relax, breathe. Oh shit ! Shit, shit, shit! - She's overdosing. - You gave him too much! I will seek help. Do not leave me alone ...

I will find help. - Keep her awake. - How? Sing. You're a kid. And you think you're better than us. Confess. To confess what? You do not care about us. From me, from Jerk, from Abe. It's a joke. - You did not want us to come. - I know how you are. You were going to go the good memories that I have here. - How are we? - Yeah. We are like a family. - It's not 7 at home, but ... - Advance. You're so weird since we took the road. We kept our distance, I do not know what to do anymore. We understand, you blame us. We are tasks on your ideal life. We are the bad guys, you're the tourist. Where are you going? Chels, you make the tourist for years. Sooner or later you'll have to accept that, maybe it's your life. She is not ideal, but it's yours. And that would be great if you could stop making the victim, and assume for once. Guy. What is it ? It's human ? He is dead. You could see that from here. What did a do? A wolf ? A bear ? what is happening in those fucking woods. Let's try to find a phone. Take only pictures ... Leave only fingerprints ... It's as if... all groups were called The D nu s. There are Les Dmunis, The destroyed ... I think sometimes, we think too much, and then everything mixes and we know more which sounds good. I miss my mom ... Thanks my God ! Help ! Help, please! Please, stop! Hello, our friend took a bullet, she's overdosing ... She is hurt. You have to take him to the hosto. Oh no... I help you to wear it. You have to be careful. I'll go, you'll see. She left. What have you done ? We gave it to him. For the pain. Young people... There is nothing like it in nature. - That's why it's bad. - Save me the lesson. Sir. Where are the others? Left seeking help. Jerk the air of rest, Chelsea and Garth the watchtower. They are looking for a radio. Well. We do not take him to the hospital. How is it? He is too far, we will not be there soon. But ... we have to try. No. No. It would be better to shorten his suffering. Shit ! Oh fuck. Alcohol consumption, or possession of a container open alcoholic beverage in a national park, is strictly prohibited.

He's the one who made you that? Why ? What is it? He has a fucking ton photos of you. Chelsea, what did he do to you this guy? Shit. Come come. Must have an exit. You should have warned me of your coming. I will have rank. Back, man. I'm serious. I watched you well. You're braying and you're horny like a big, stupid bear. Fuck, backs dude! No need to swear. Hunters are told not to come. They are told that the mountain is not sure, but they insist ... - Who are you fucking? - Garth ... No. This guy gets off, he shoots us. He has corpses full of his cellar. Who do you think you are fucking? I think your friend is very stress . He is in an unknown environment. It is typical of the animals pi g s. They are used to large spaces, but once stuck. They become violent. You're taking me out of animals? Stop pointing my guy. Chelsea, you should know that. Federal law forbidden the carrying of weapons in this park. I see that you are always able. We have work to do, but I will save you, I promise you. Do not be afraid, little wolf. I will heal you. We waited for you ... Welcome, little wolf. Welcome home, my love. Go slowly. Not too fast. I gave you a lot from what you sniff. Do not inject it. It's too strong. I know but... If you brought back here, it's to take it. So... You are served. Maybe a high dose, will help you wean you off for good. You see, Chelsea. What we are trying to do here, it is to withdraw the city from your body. We're going to take off all the layers of your soiled existence. And that includes getting rid of the pink of your hair. Have you ever seen that in nature? I do not think so, no. I will take care of you. Better than your friends. Better than your family. They do not understand you. Not like me. Not like us. We are all here to ... to heal our wounds. And you... you are not made for the city. Nor for the suburbs. You are a creature of nature. A wild beast. You know the taste of blood and you are thirsty. Your friends would never have understood. Your family tried to hide it from you. They tried to evade you To your nature. Protect yourself, who you really are. But not anymore... We are at home. And again together. Nobody will stop us. Because we are free. We are wild. And we are one. And if we had a taste for freedom? small dose, of course. I think it's better to come back a few years back. Delete recent years of our lives. To finally come back, our last moment together. No crunch, huh? I remember our meeting. I could not believe it. Such a young girl ... You came so naturally, so instinctive. You have not hesitated. I need you to recognize what happened. I want you to admit remember what you did. Well... No need to cry for overturned milk. It can be remedied. The Amerindians, prepared a unique decoction. She helped them contact their spiritual ancestors. It was a way to link their true natures. An introspection. A return to the sources. Let's see how much of your decocation you must, to remind you who you are. Wait, I want to do it. - Do it ? - Please, please. After all that happened, I deserve it. Do you want to punish yourself? Okay. Here. Just a little shoot. I'll give myself ... Yes... I should not have let you go. Fucking tar . This one is still charged, asshole. You run away? You run away? The winter was long. The wolves are hungry. You know where are the others? There are pieces of one at the South West. And pieces of another, lower down at the foot of the mountain. They died because of you. You should not have brought them. This is not a place to celebrate. Why did you come back? To kill me, like your uncle Pete? Target shooting. He was teaching you to shoot. You turned the weapon against him. Your own uncle. Your flesh and your blood. I kept your secret. I protected you. Show me fucking fucking. I saw something in you. That no one else has seen. We are the same. Say it. Say it ! We are the same. Say it ! Yeah, you're right. We are the same. Take only pictures. Leave only fingerprints. Only kill time.
