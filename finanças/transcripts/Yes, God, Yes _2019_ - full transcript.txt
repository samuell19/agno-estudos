School mass today at 2:00. Why don't you be gift bearer again? Sure. Hmm. OK, it's like this, guys are like microwave ovens. And ladies are like conventional ovens. Guys only need a few seconds, you know, like a microwave, to get... switched on. While ladies, they typically need to... preheat for a while. But God created sex with boundaries and for a purpose. Does anyone wanna take a stab at what the boundary is? Yes, Wade? - Marriage. - Very good. And does anybody know the purpose? - To have children. - Perfecto. When a man and a woman receive the sacrament of matrimony, God calls on them to create children in his image. Any sex outside of one man, one woman, one marriage is against God's plan. Um, what about sex with yourself? Can you create children from sex with yourself? - No. - Right, so? - It's against God's plan. - Exactly. So, is that what the Bible means by "spilling your seed"? Is it spilling if you catch it? All right, all right. We are called on to be chaste until we are married. And that means no sex... with yourself or anyone else... until you stand at that altar and you say "I do" or else it is damnation for all eternity. And remember... God is always watching. Capiche? They gave us Baby Think-It-Over in Christian Lifestyles. I'm not even having sex, they should just give them to the slutty girls. Oh, have you had to watch the partial-birth abortion video yet? - It's really awful. - No, no! Don't ruin it for me. How was Morality? It was fine. Did you know that masturbating is a sin? Ew. Of course. Why? I was just wondering. Making me rewind Titanic back to the car scene twice is probably also a sin, just in case you were wondering that next. Look, I only asked you to do that because I couldn't hear what Kate whispered to Leo - when he said, "Where to, Miss?" - Mm-hmm. Which just happens to be right before they make out and steam up that car window that Kate slaps her hand on. I didn't write it! Hey! Hi, Gus. Sit, Gus. Sit. Welcome! OK. Here we go! Damn it! Titanic! Yes! You've got mail. Mom? Wet? Uh... Underwear? Ohh. What? Alice! Dinner! - I confess to almighty God... - Almighty God... and to you, my brothers and sisters, that I have sinned through my own fault, in my thoughts and in my words, in what I have done and in what I have failed to do... The Millers invited us over to watch the game. Great, I'll make my cheesy potatoes. Oh, Damn it, Ron. Now I'm all wet! Calm down, Gail, you're not that wet. So, uh, Alice, I heard you got on Wade Friday night. Stephanie told me she walked in on you guys in my sauna. Ooh! Gettin' steamy in the sauna! No, we were just back there getting some drinks. We were only gone for like a minute! Yeah, that's long enough for Wade. I was just messin'. Listen. You don't have to put out just because you like a boy. I don't like him. And now, for the Bible passages that back all this up... We're gonna start with Galatians. Heather, why don't you start us off? The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity, debauchery... OK, so, I just bought this Blink 182 CD from Sam Goody, right? Um, I upload them to my computer and then I just put 'em on here. Easy as pie. The album's amazing, by the way. It's called Enema of the State. Get it? I bet you know all about enemas, don't you? Can you not talk about enemas near my baby, please? Yeah, I'm gonna... Thank you. Such a perv. What's an enema? It's when you fall water skiing and water shoots up your butt. Well, look who it is. Where were you this weekend? You didn't come to my party. Yeah, I heard things got pretty crazy. Everyone's been talking about you and Wade. - Oh? - Yeah. They're saying you tossed his salad. - What? - Gross! You tossed his salad in my sauna? What? No! No! Who, who said that? Some girl in my Geometry class was telling a bunch of us. Heather's really pissed too. She just gave Wade a promise bracelet. OK. I mean, I've never even heard of dressing someone's salad! So... The party was really fun. Why didn't you come? I was on a retreat. Oh! Like a spa? No, a retreat ran by the school. It's called Kirkos and I got this necklace on it. See? Cool. What'd you do there? We're not allowed to talk about it with anyone who hasn't been. But it totally changed my life. Coming, Beth? Yeah. I gotta go. You guys should sign up for the next one. I think it'd be good for you. Since when does Beth eat lunch with Nina and those girls? I have to go on that retreat. Do you think she thinks that I actually tasted Wade's salad or whatever? I don't know. Beth's such a moron. I never have any clue what's she's talking about so she probably made it up. I'm gonna go get more milk. Oh. Hey, Heather. Hey, Wade. Can't have pudding without milk! She's disgusting. I think I'm going to ask Heather to bear the gifts with Jacob today. Alice, if you want to continue to be a gift bearer, you have to conduct yourself like one. Your body is a gift from God. You need to honor it. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Um, bless me Father for I have sinned. It has been a week since my last confession. These are my sins... Talking back to my dad... Not helping my mom in the kitchen... Forgetting to feed the dog... And... And anything else? That's it. For penance, why don't you do the dishes for a week? Give your mom a break. And ten Hail Marys and ten Our Fathers. God, the Father of mercies, through the death and resurrection of his Son, has reconciled the world to itself and sent the Holy Spirit among us for the forgiveness of sins... Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us of our trespasses, as we forgive those that trespass against us... Your body is a gift from God. It's against God's plan. You need to honor it. Or else it is damnation for all eternity. Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. It's called Kirkos. I think it'd be good for you. ♪ Michael row the boat ashore ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Michael row the boat ashore ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Sister help to trim the sails ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Sister help to trim the sails ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Michael row the boat ashore ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ Are we there? ♪ Michael row the boat ashore ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ I can't do this.

Who's that? Are you serious? That's Chris. He's only like the star of the football team. Welcome to Kirkos.

I didn't mean to scare you! You settling in? I've got a sweatshirt here for you. Thanks. And... next order of beeswax is... I'm gonna need your cell phone and/or watch, if you have 'em. Did you bring either one of those with you? Mm-hmm. No phone? - Mm-mm. - K. Don't worry, you won't be needing a watch this weekend anyway because... you're on Jesus' time! See ya! Please find your small group number! Cut the chit-chat, please, and have a seat. Sit at the table with your small group number. Please find your small group number. - I guess I'll see you later. - What? Group One? Awesome! I'm Chris, Group One's Senior Leader. Have a seat. Group One too? Awesome! Have a seat. You are here as a part of God's plan. His spirit moved each of you to sign up for this retreat, which is a unique experience that will challenge you in new and profound ways. Kirkos is a time to find meaning in the highs and lows of your life. Over these next four days you will hear from your classmates and be invited to open up as well. It will strengthen your relationship with yourself, but most importantly, with Jesus. Now let's get started. On the papers that Mrs. Veda is handing out, you're going to find a list of feelings. Go through them and circle any that you may have felt in the past year or so. There are no wrong answers. So just, just be honest. While ladies, they typically need to... preheat for a while. OK. Let's finish up. Pass your papers toward the aisles. And make sure that your name is printed clearly on top. Come on. The other night I dreamt that I was walking along the beach with the Lord. As we walked, scenes from my life flashed across the sky and in each scene, I noticed that there were footprints in the sand. In some scenes there were two sets of footprints and in other scenes there was only one set of footprints. Hey. Oh. Hey. - Hey, Sister Louise. - Hi. Do you mind if I snag another stupendous Walking Taco? Of course, dear. You're a growing boy! And Walking Tacos have lots of protein and fiber. Oh, may I have some sour cream too, please? - Oh, yes. - Thank you. You're welcome. What about you, dear? - Oh, no, no thanks. - No? No sour cream? No, that is the best part. OK. I guess I'll have some. How's everything going for you so far, Alice? It's great. You know, it's OK if you think things are totally weird. It's supposed to be a little weird. At least at first. I'll see you later, Alice. OK, bye! I come from a very big family. I have four younger siblings and... an older sister... Melissa. She made honor roll every semester and she founded Habitat for Humanity at our school. She's the star of our family. One time, I came home at 2:00 a.m.... three hours past my curfew. And no one even noticed. It felt like no one cared if I was there or not. Um... Uh... I'd now like to play my first song. ♪ You don't notice me standing here ♪ ♪ Wishing you could somehow feel ♪ ♪ I just wish that you could feel ♪ Last fall, Melissa came to pick me up from a friend's house to take me home. ♪ And each day we were born ♪ And the next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital being told that we were in an accident and that I had three broken ribs... And the first thought I had was... Maybe my parents will finally start to notice me. Melissa was fine but... my parents were still obsessed with her. It felt like they blamed me for the accident. That if she hadn't had to come and pick me up, she wouldn't have missed her Science Bowl nationals. But then, I came on to this retreat... And I realized that God loves me... my friends love me... and... I love me too. OK, guys, circle up, circle up. Now, this is one of my favorite songs, and while you're listening, I want you to imagine that the eyes in the song are Jesus's eyes. ♪ Love ♪ ♪ I get so lost sometimes ♪ ♪ Days pass ♪ ♪ And this emptiness fills my heart ♪ ♪ When I want to run away ♪ Would you look at how these gorgeous pines contrast against the blue sky?! Isn't God's paint palette just magnificent? So did I tell you Nina told me she liked my hair - this morning at breakfast? - Mm-hmm. She said she can't do it with her own hair because every time she tries it her hair gets all bumpy. So I said I could show her how I do it and she said she would invite me over sometime! Isn't that cool? Yeah. I mean, you can come too, of course, if you want. Well, maybe I should ask Nina first if it's OK that you're there, but I mean do you even wanna come? - Whoa! - Oh, my God. Are you OK? Everything OK here, troops? Ooh, comrade. That's quite a battle wound. Uh-huh. Can you walk? - No. No. No. - OK. Just don't move. Let's get you to the nurse, huh? Hey. I was just coming to let you know we're doing the group photo down by the bridge in five. Great. I'll be there. Everything OK in here? Yep. OK. What was that? I specifically asked you for your phone on the day you arrived. Look, I'm gonna have to tell Father about this. Uh, Chris, could you come in, please? Hey, Alice, what'd you have for breakfast? Cereal. Oh, you didn't have salad? Like a Wade salad. OK. Everybody say Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ! OK, great! Guys, head up toward the cafeteria. We're gonna have lunch in our small groups today, OK? And Alice, Alice, a quick word. Nina said you kept your phone. You know, we have a reason for everything that we ask you to do here and it's very important that you follow our rules. Sorry, Father. I hope you understand I can't let this go unpunished. Now first, you must empty the trash receptacles. There are four of them. One there... and one there... and one there... Come on. What? Alice! - Hey. - What's up? Just finished cleaning. We made S'mores after lunch. Saved you one. Thanks. We pretended each marshmallow was a different mortal sin before burning it. Yours was lust. Oh. Look, I want you to know I'm not mad about the phone thing, OK? You're doing a real good job and I think you're on the right path now. So, just keep up the good work, OK? OK. I believe in you. "Dear Andrew... Remember when you were little and Mom and I would tuck you in, and you would make us kiss you on both of your cheeks at exactly the same time or else you couldn't fall asleep? I always thought those were my favorite memories from when we were a young family. But I was wrong. Every day is a new favorite memory with you. I love you, kiddo. Love, Dad." "Dear Laura... Your father and I love you so much. And although I will always cherish those days when you were little, I love being able to do adult things with you too... like getting our nails done and showing you how to cook my famous baked ziti. But no matter what, you'll always be my baby girl. I love you so much." "Dear Alice, You're a wonderful daughter and the best church partner a father could ask for. It's so amazing to watch you grow into the wholesome young woman God created you to be. I am so proud of you for always making good choices. Love you, Al. Love, Dad." Amen. Amen. All right. Like myself and my fellow senior leaders have done, we are now gonna ask that you all share your own stories. Moments when life was difficult, or hard, or overwhelming. Times where you felt Jesus was far away. My girlfriend dumped me last week. That was really rough. I thought everything was going well, and last week, she had her friend call me to break up with me for her. And I'm pretty sure it was a three-way call, and she was listening, so I acted like it was cool, but it really sucked. Thank you, Andrew. This is really hard to talk about. But... Last month... my Grandma died. She lived in Idaho, so I didn't see her that often. And like, it makes me really sad that we didn't get to talk much before she died. The saddest part is... after her funeral, we went back to her house, and her dog was there, just looking so sad. It was, like, walking around the house looking for her. It had no idea. OK... Um... Well... Speaking of dogs... My dog... Gus... died a few weeks ago. Um, our neighbors put out some chipmunk poison. He must have got into it through the chain-link fence. My family was playing basketball in our driveway, and the ball went over the fence, and I went to go get it, and... that's where I found him... lying on his side. He wasn't moving. - I thought he was just... - Excuse me. All right, can I have your attention, please? All eyes and ears here. I'm sorry to report that earlier this morning, I found something rather disturbing on my office computer. It appears that someone has used it to engage in an online chat of... well, let's just say an explicit nature. Would anyone like to take responsibility for this? I didn't think so. Now, I have no way of knowing who did this, but whoever it was, even if I don't know you did it, you do, and so does God. But in keeping with the theme of this retreat, I hope that whomever did do it feels compelled by the Spirit of Christ to come forward before the retreat is through. So, Alice, how would you describe your relationship with Jesus? - Fine. - Just fine? Fine, as in good. Do you think that there might be something getting in the way? Something that's preventing it from being better? OK, well, why don't you try reflecting back on that feelings checklist you filled out on your first day here. Do any of the emotions that you circled on there bring anything up? Um... I was feeling envious of my best friend when she got a Beamer for her birthday, because I drive a Buick Le Sabre. Anything else? She also got Oakley sunglasses for Christmas. What about feeling turned on? No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear, and he knows what is truly in your heart. OK. So, have you ever felt turned on? And did you take any action when you had that feeling? You didn't take any action? No. Nothing with your classmate Wade? No. Someone made that up. Alice, this retreat isn't gonna do you any favors if you're not honest. How's this? Wow! That one's huge. Way to go, Alice. Thanks. And when you turn it on, our plasma rises out of this little Oak unit. But when you press off, it sinks back down and a Rothko takes its place. Your rec room sounds amazing! Hey, Nina, that, um... leader meeting is about to start. Right, right. I forgot about that. Thank you. Um, I gotta go. OK. I'll see you at the campfire. Hey! What? What is your problem with me? My problem? My problem is that Heather almost dumped me because of that disgusting rumor you started. I didn't start it! Yeah, well, if you didn't, who did? I don't know! I... Did you start it? No! I have a girlfriend. OK. Well, both you and I know that nothing happened. Are you telling people that? You need to start! Because everyone thinks that I'm a slut, even the teachers. Look, you're the only other person who knows what happened. And no one believes me! Hey, Wade! What are you still doing here? Just on my way out, Father. OK, good, good. Hey, how's the old shotput arm - doing in the off season? - Good, Father. Just trying not to do too much heavy lifting. ♪ Give me a word Give me a sign ♪ ♪ Show me where to look Tell me what will I find ♪ ♪ What will I find? ♪ ♪ Lay me on the ground Fly me in the sky ♪ ♪ Show me where to look Tell me what will I find ♪ ♪ What will I find? ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Oh, heaven, let your light shine down ♪ ♪ Oh, heaven, let your light shine down ♪ ♪ Oh, heaven, let your light shine down ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ I need a cup of tea. I'm all done. OK, dear. It is the best. ...and the colorful, like, floral tops. - The stripes, the stripes! - Hey! It's so good. Can I talk to you for a minute? - Um... - I'll save you a seat. OK. What's up? Nina asked me to sit with her, so I don't want to make her wait. I saw Nina giving Adam a blow job. What?! Yeah. In the woods after lunch. Why do you think it's OK to keep making things up? I'm not making this up! Gabby told me you were talking about your dog dying in your small group? - Did Gus die? - OK, look. I just said that because... I didn't know what to do! I didn't have anything to say, and everyone had these really sad stories... God, this is just like that time in sixth grade when you told everyone Jason gave you a "purple nurple" on the bus. You want attention. - OK... - You know what? I bet you actually did toss Wade's salad. I don't even know what that means! Oh, my God. Quit the act. I know you know what it means, just like you know the sex scene in Titanic comes right after they're in the car. You were the one in Father's office, weren't you? What? It makes perfect sense. And I am sick of constantly feeling embarrassed for being friends with a pervy psycho. Ugh. Ugh. Alice, hey. Hey. Is everything all right? Uh... Do you wanna talk? Is everything OK? What are you doing? What are you doing?!

I went to Catholic school for 12 years. I was baptized, confirmed, the whole kit 'n caboodle. You're not anymore? No. How come? San Francisco. The '70s. Sex. Women. Mm. Lots of reasons. But I remember being your age and just being scared shitless that I was gonna wind up in hell. Really? - For what? - Oh, God. For everything. Cheating on my homework, for giving up sugar for Lent and then eating a whole jar of gumdrops underneath my grandmother's staircase. I literally thought I was going to hell for eating gumdrops. And that there would be a big red devil there with a poker, and he'd poke at me. And my bed would be made out of coals, and there'd be nothing but peas to eat, 'cause I hate peas. I thought I was gonna go to hell. for... rewinding Titanic back to the sex scene... three times. You know, I thought I was gonna go to hell for looking through my dad's Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition. I thought I was going to hell for having cybersex! Yep. You know, the truth is, nobody knows what they're doing any more than the rest of us. We're all just trying to figure out our shit. But be careful online, OK? Don't give your password out to anyone, not even someone who says they work for AOL. They don't. They just want to give you the Melissa virus. Now, I got to get you back to that Jesus camp. I don't want any nuns showing up at my bar looking for ya. I know. Come on. I'll give you a lift. Mm. - Thanks. - No problem, kid. Hey. Have you thought about where you might go to college? Um... probably State? Why don't you check out some schools on the East and West Coasts? You might like getting outta this town for a bit. Wait! Do you know what... tossing someone's salad is? It's means licking someone's butthole. Good luck out there, kid. Hey, how's it going? I really miss my cat. Um... what's your cat's name? Kyoto. Oh, that's pretty. What does it mean? It's a city is Japan. I love Japan! I'm going to go with my mom when I turn 18 as a... a graduation present. Cool. What are you gonna do there? Try all the weird Japanese candy and eat a ton of sushi. I've never had sushi. Oh, my God! It's so good. We should go to Taki sometime. They have the best sushi. - Yeah. - In this city, anyway. Hey. Hey. So, everyone says that it was Wade who used Father's computer. Oh. Yeah. Father found his bracelet in his office or something. Mm. I'm sorry I thought it was you. It's OK. But now that we know he's a perv, he probably made up that rumor about you guys. He clearly made it up to hide the fact that he's gay. What? Yeah, apparently, whatever he did on Father's computer was gay. But... he has a girlfriend. Yeah. A girlfriend who doesn't even kiss because she's afraid it'll lead to sex. The perfect cover-up. Ew. We have a mantra here at Kirkos. Question the First, Weep the Second, Accept the Third, Live the Fourth. It refers to the four days of Kirkos. Now, they're all pretty self-explanatory, except for that last one: live. What that means is to take what you have learned this weekend, what you have discovered about yourself, and incorporate it into your everyday lives. To live each day like it is the fourth day of Kirkos. Now, I'm going to ask that you come up here and speak about your experiences this weekend with the whole group. There's no set order. Just let the Spirit of Christ move you. I, uh... I gave in to temptation. This is not who I am, but I let myself lose control. This retreat has taught me, though, that, through the love of my friends, teachers, and, most importantly, Jesus, that there is nothing I can't overcome. Being in high school sucks. People love to talk, but... just because you hear something doesn't mean that it's true. When people spread lies about you, it hurts. It makes you feel alone... and empty. And... sometimes... you do things that you're not proud of. But look... we're all hiding stuff. All kinds of stuff. What if we just try to be honest and to treat each other with respect? That's what Jesus wanted, right? And then, maybe, we can stop feeling so guilty about who we are all the time, because the truth is, we're all just trying to figure out our shit. Sorry, um... Have you ever had sushi? Sushi? You mean like raw fish? No. Who are you gonna go to church with when I go to college? College? That's not for two more years. A year and a half. I don't know. Maybe I'll start going to the late service again so your mom will come. Besides, State's only 40 minutes away. Just come home on the weekends. Hey. - Um... - Hey. You don't have to be scared of me. I... I'm not scared of you. It won't happen again. Friends? Friends. Hug? Side hug. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been a week since my last confession. These are my sins. Talking back to my parents. Not doing my chores. Is that it? No. It's something that happened on the retreat. OK. I watched people having sex. All right. It was a video. There was a man and a woman. And the woman was wearing a hot pink bra. They were on the hood of a car. With graffiti on it. And I did it, even though I knew it was a sin. Will God still forgive me? That's between you and God. For penance, fifty Hail Marys and fifty Our Fathers. God, the Father of mercies, through the death and resurrection of his Son has reconciled the world to himself and sent the Holy Spirit among us for the forgiveness of sins... "Where to, miss?"
