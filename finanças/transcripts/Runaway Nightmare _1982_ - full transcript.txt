- Have you enough fun yet today? - You go ahead and take the van back. I'll get back to the ranch a little later. - I'm thinking of going into LA. I just can't take staying out here for longer than a week at a time. - Well everybody's about as happy as they make up their minds to be. - That's hard when you're surrounded by worms and snails. - This business was your idea. - Jesus, all I'm thinking about is getting away from all these insects. I want to see some human faces again. You want a beer? I'd like a little adventure, some excitement. I just wish something would happen, anything. I still like the desert. Everything here is so quiet and predictable. - That's just it, it's too quiet and boring. I mean nothing ever happens out here. - Hey come over here. Maybe they just buried some junk. - Nah nah they'd just dump it like everybody else. She's still alive. What are we gonna do with her? - Well we're not gonna bury her again. Look we'll take her back to the house and we'll call the cops. Look Ralph I'm gonna go into the kitchen and get some ice water. Why don't you just kinda watch her okay for a minute. I'll be right back. I think there's something outside. Get your rifle and cover me. - Where is she? - I don't know the last time I saw her, she was unconscious there on the bed. I don't know what happened. I don't like to be lied to by any man. - Hey what are those little crawly things out there? - Well the plot in the left are the worms and the one on the right are the snails. - Do you grow them? - Well we raise them. They're considered to be delicacies. You see the secret to eating snails, when you get to the gooey part you gotta put them in your mouth. - Will you shut up. Tell me what do your insects like to eat out there? Could they say, devour a human carcass? - Oh sure yeah, it'd take a long time though. I would want to. - Oh wonderful, being eaten by my own worms. Hey she's asleep in here. Don't wake her yet she'll be alright. - You mean you didn't plant her? Oh no, we've been following those men since they left the warehouse. - Shut up, come on we're leaving now. - We'll have to get together again real soon. - You're coming with us. - What do you mean, where to? Now we can't leave just yet. Okay move out or get carried out. - Everything happened at once. First the water dries up, they built that niigata plant over the hill, I get caught by a bunch of psychos. - Whereabouts are we going? - About how long will it take before we get there? - Look it's just us and her right now. So you get her from behind, and I'll keep her busy right here. - Okay. - Well if you didn't bury the girl then you know who did. Then you intend to do something about it. How you gonna handle all this? Here I'll fix it. Well how much longer you gonna keep us here? We had nothing to do with burying the girl. - Hesperia will decide. - Well tell me something, how exactly do we fit in to your plan? - Oh would you look at the size of that thing. - Look, we had nothing to do with burying the girl. I mean we just found her. - Hesperia will decide. - Okay I give up, then when exactly will Hesperia get here? - I told you you shouldn't open up something you're not familiar with. It's got to be an insane asylum in here. Is this an asylum? Oh what do you mean? I'm not gonna wait around until they whack us up and eat us, Jesus Christ look. A bunch of women aren't gonna keep me here if I want to leave. I'm gonna water those worms tonight. I'm gonna go out that door. Alright get out of the way unless you want to get hurt. - They're you're responsibility while the rest of us are gone tomorrow. Will we have them all to ourselves? - We'll have all of tomorrow to torture them. - How long's it been? - I don't know, long enough for me to count all the nails in these rafters I guess. - What hit me? - I think you walked into Hesperia on your way out the door. - What you find out when I was out? - Only that we've been placed into some kind of a dark room. So what now? Hey there's a door over here. - Oh terrific, somebody forgot to unlock it. - Some kind of trick. - Yeah but I tell you we better make our escape now because we might not get another chance. - I'm into bondage and discipline. - All things considered I think I'd rather be eaten by the worms. - You're gonna go through beautiful screams of pain and passion. You have no idea what you're gonna feel. - You know I really think your trouble is you don't get laid enough. Well aren't you gonna do something? - Yeah I'd spit in her face except I don't have any spit left. - We have to cleanse them with fire. You broke the agreement. - The voice told me to kill. We live by the laws. - Then I want to settle up with a duel. What are the weapons? - Pistols. Isn't this exciting? We're gonna have a duel. What are our chances? - Well Sadie chose pistols. Sadie's the best there is with guns. Hesperia can't shoot at all. Hey that's the girl we dug up. - I'll make this quick. No I'm gonna take a long time with you. - Isn't that clever, Hesperia gave Sadie a trick gun. Oh wow man, her head's all gone. What happened? Sadie lost and Hesperia won. Come on let's go. - Is there anything you want Ralph? - Could you bring in some light bulbs? - I guess you just made a friend. - Well I could use a friend about now. - I wonder what they're up to now? You know I'm really beginning to get used to this place. - Don't you think is just a little bit too cold and dark in here? - No I mean all those delicious women. - You know it's hard for me to get aroused when I keep seeing my life pass in front of me. Besides some of those delicious women have some pretty rugged girlfriends. - Maybe they're problem is that they've been away from men to long. - Hey come here. Not you the other one. - Why don't you go around back and open the door down here and let us sneak out okay? - Listen they're having a meeting now figuring out what to do with you. - Is there any chance they'll let us go? - No it's either make you a member or sacrifice you. - No come back wait, wait. Bring them here. Well is this all for us? You've been selected as candidates for membership. - What exactly are we being members of? You're not members of anything yet. First you have to go through the tests. - Don't worry this is probably just some kind of initiation. - Well I don't want to go through one of their tests and come out with a high pitched voice. Am I gonna have trouble with you? - You know what this is? This is probably one large wet dream. We just found ourselves involved with a group of sex starved women. Take them away. - Never had a wet dream like this before. - I wonder what this test is all about. - Probably to see how long it takes for us to rot to death. - It's time. They have to go through one last test. - Well at least we got a place to sleep tonight. I think they're ready now. Okay let's go. - You're one of us now. - What exactly does that mean? - It means that you'll be with us body and soul. - We're taking you to Hesperia, she'll tell you everything. Keep moving. - You've been voted into the group and will enjoy all the privileges and the sacrifices of membership. Was the vote unanimous? - Are you kidding? - Stupid bug farmers. - Worm farmers. Shut up. What do you mean by sacrifices and privileges? - It means that you'll get a share of all communal profits. What's out contribution to all this? - Nothing spiritually, but you'll give all of your possessions. - What is our share in the communal profit? Nothing right now. - Well don't you think it just a little bit unfair? - The profits will start coming in just as soon as we can get through the revenge and steal back the platinum. I heard what you said but can you say it a different way? - The organized crime group we were dealing with crossed us and stole the shipment of platinum we were supposed to deliver. - So you intend to take on the mob yourself? - No, you'll help also in an active part. - Look look, I haven't had a lot of sleep in the last couple of days. I wonder if I can get some sleep before I die. - Your job is to take those crates right there over there. - Why can't they just stay where they are? - I don't know, Leslie goes keep them busy. Have them load and unload boxes. - What is that plane for? - Oh that we used that to carry the cargo across the border. - What do you transport? - Guns and bombs and things. - So the syndicate got the guns and then got you guys to transport these guns across the border. Well what went wrong? - Well we used to make a trip at least once a week and then Fate, well she had a meeting with the mob and it was big. - The platinum. - The platinum. And she was there for three days and then they brought her back in a crate and that's when you guys dug her up. - You can't sleep now, you gotta chop some wood first. I want you to chop this into splinters. - I can take you where you can get some sleep. - You have no idea how much I need this rest. These aren't the best conditions. I don't think you understand I'm exhausted. I think you're gonna be disappointed. Here hold him down. - Boy Ralph that sure is kinky. Bug farmers - Just eat it and shut up huh? - What's the matter, aren't you hungry? - I mean, you know, I mean, I'm into awareness. You know what I mean, I mean, I mean I know what life means. That's what, that's life, that's what it's all about. - Hey man, I don't know want to sweat life man. I just get toasted and man everything works. - She goes what's wrong you can't make up your own mind? So I went shoom. I landed her down two or three flights of steps. She shouldn't of asked me out. - I hate men. Bug farmers - Don't touch her. - I'm gonna waste you. - Jason. - So anyhow what you do is you see you pack the worms in mud. - I'm gonna cut you up. - Jason. Aren't you just a little bit tired? - No I mean I had plenty of rest on the plane. I mean just calm down take it easy this is fun. - I'd like to get around people again who aren't slanted. - Are you complaining again? Look I got somebody I want you to meet. - No thanks I know too many people already. - Hey I'm trying to communicate. I'm into sunshine, awareness, good karma, vibes, and witchcraft. - Well we do have a lot in common and we'll have to talk all about that some day. - I'd like to mix our blood. - Look I want to watch a show, and I'd like to see the rest without being bothered. Jason. - Every man I've touched has died a violent death. Ralph, you're gonna drive us into town with your van. Alright everybody out. If I can't get any sleep nobody else is. Yeah I'll be right in. - Okay how do you want to work this? I'll go to the washroom and get out through the window. - We couldn't do that. I mean they trust us, they need help. - Yeah right, soon as I get free I'll make sure they all get committed in the asylum. - Look the most I figure out is this. That somehow they work for the syndicate. That the syndicate supplies them with weapons, which they in turn transport below the border. See somehow Fate got possession of this suitcase filled with platinum. - Oh okay alright so something goes wrong and they bury the girl. See what I can't figure out is if they're weapon sellers then what were they doing with a suitcase full of platinum? - Everything happens at once. First the funds dry up, then the plane gives out, then Fate gets buried, then those things show up. - They're kinda nice after a while. - Well I'll stop them once we get to the warehouse. - Well I'm kinda glad they both happened. - Wait here. - Isn't that sickening? - Ah come one don't encourage her, jeez. But she likes you. - Yeah the fact she's nuts I suppose doesn't make any difference. - She's coming over here I think. - Is she coming? - I think so. What to dance? - Not just now thanks. Not just yet. - You'd feel better if you had a drink. - This is a real wild town. - Yeah boy next to raising worms, is a real riot. - I think that girl needs our help. - No now say let's don't mix in this. - No I mean I think she needs our help. They need your help there. - I don't want go over there. Ah come on Jesus. - It's okay just a misunderstanding. Ah it was just a misunderstanding. This is the first time I've ever been to this place before. - Look, there's just no room here, you'll have to find your own place to sleep. - Beat it. I think we should get to know each other a little better. Now that you're one of family I thought I'd do you a little favor. I won't kill you as quickly. - You're doing me a favor. - I mean not saying it's today or maybe not tonight, but sometime soon. Now if you don't stop molesting these girls I'll see that you suffer before your die. - Ralph you're amazing 'cause every time I see you you're causing some kind of trouble with these girls. Just come with me huh. Here I'll move first. Jason. - It's your move. You can take me. Jason, how did you and Ralph get started as bug farmers? - Well actually we're etymological cultivators. You see I was always in marketing, and Ralph needed help in that area. And with my experience in distribution and Ralph's knowledge of the insect food, well we make a profit. Bug farmers - I wish you wouldn't do that. - We really appreciate what you've done for us. - You see I told you all you gotta do is get to know them and they become your friends. I mean these girls are just like everybody else. It's your move. You can take me. - Don't get up, you two look good together. - I like it out here at this time. Yeah it's hard just to stay alive around here. How did you get mixed up in all this insanity? Oh I've been with Hesperia ever since she was a rich girl in Marin County. But we started this place together. Oh Hesperia's bank rolling this place. What about all the others here? - They're just fanatics, Hesperia controls them. The two of us split the profits. Now we're just gonna walk into some warehouse in the desert and take back a load of platinum just like that huh? I know what I'm doing but I need your help. There's too much you're not telling me. - You'll understand when it's finished. I want to leave with you. - With me? - I think about you a lot. - You think about me? - I'd like to touch you. - I'd like to trust you too. - I didn't bring you out here by accident. - We've waited one week for this revenge. We'll assault the warehouse, and retrieve the platinum suitcase. - Yes and what's my part in all this? You and the other man are decoys. If he gets in my way he'll get accidentally shot in the back. - We'll come back here for the traditional celebration, and then we'll move on to a new location. Oh they'll screw something up. - Our two new members here have dedicated their lives to this mission. - How are you? Where in this desert is this warehouse? - Hey you suppose you could change the station? - No. - Say do you think might turn that down just a touch? About how much further we gonna have to go? - Ralph and Jason will attack the warehouse from the south window. The whole two of us? - Everyone will have an attack position. What's taking you so long? We gotta get in there. Have you cut the glass at all? What are you doing up there? The girls are in by now you gotta break it. Well what now? We're supposed to follow this route. See if there's a light by that wall I'll go over here. Hey I found the switch. Look I'll stay here you go ahead and check down there. - Fate, how did you get through the first door, without a clearance? - I'm not here on business. - But it's really good to see. - I'm real glad to see you Alex. Okay we got the suitcase let's go. - Okay we got the platinum suitcase let's go. - Hey is this a real time bomb? - Don't touch that stupid. - Hey this things ticking. - Yeah they run on electricity all the time. You just connect the timer, and then you just have to check the wires. - Connect the wires and you set the timing? - Hey man am I late? Had to park the bike. I mean I'm not gonna leave it just anywhere. I'll load my bike in the van. - We can't fit it in the van, there's no room. - You can sit on me. - I can sit on you? Oh it was simple. She just walked in the office and pulled the gun and got right to the suitcase. - I told you there'd be no trouble. By this time tomorrow we'll be in South America. - I thought I saw a spider. - You, I wish you wouldn't do that. Next time I'll aim for your head. - Oh, okay. Okay scout let's go. - Ralph, I was wondering could you help me with this? - Sure of course. - I can't seem to open it, I've tried every way possible. - You know what we're gonna need? We're gonna need some tools for this. - Okay I'll go out to the garage and get some. - Ow that's hot. I burned myself it's hot. It's hot, I burned myself. - Hey man I get burned every night. We got fellas in the warehouse. Here I'll watch this window. - Wow look at all the colors. Everybody in the barn. Hurry, let's fly out. But the plane can't fly. - There's not enough room you have to protect our getaway. - Well what about giving us something to protect ourselves with. - Here this aught to take care of you. - It's a bullet proof vest stupid. - Wait a minute how good is this anyway? - Works just fine. - They're crazy that plane can't fly anyway let's get out of here. - Hey what are you doing, we both can't fit in there. - Hold this. We'll make him talk at the warehouse. Well where'd we land? We're at the room ranch. You'll stay here and I'll take the copter back to Marin County. - You're already dead. Question is how quickly do you want to die. Where is the suitcase? - Look I know I'm gonna die anyway and I'll tell you what you want to know about the suitcase but I'd like to know how come you double crossed the girls? - You're negotiator Fate stole the suitcase from us. Then she was planning to leave town herself. - Why deal in platinum? - Platinum, the case contains an experimental explosive devise that ignites with air. - She double crossed the girls then she double double crossed you. I don't get it. - Simple when you're dead. - Oh God. - There is no God, nothing can save you now. What? - Ralph is that you? - There was an explosion. You gotta get me out of here. - Ralph where are you? - I'm at the warehouse. I thought Jason'd be back at the worm ranch. - I can't hear you. Where is the suitcase? I hid the suitcase I can't think right now. - Listen, everyone's been killed and I need to talk to you alone. I'll be out front. - Okay, great. You sure that's where you hid the suitcase? - Hey I remember that much. That's before everything else happened. Yeah I put the suitcase in the hall closet. The suitcase belonged to the syndicate. But somebody took it from them. - Oh I was the one that stole it. Yeah I just couldn't get away with it. And that's why they buried me. - No no no no, I mean there man. They were talking about the one that was double crossing everybody. - That was me. - Well that means you murdered a lot of people. - I've lost count. - Well you're gonna be going to the commune, and I should go check up on the ranch so I can just get off here. - This is just where you're getting off. - You don't need a partner do you? - You don't want to share it and neither do I. - You know I wouldn't tell anybody. I saved your life. - There's to much involved here. It's the most valuable suitcase in the world. There's nothing more expensive than platinum. - Except plutonium. - Hey what the hell's the noise? - Oh that's our fortune in platinum. - No I mean the explosion. - Seems that the platinum was really plutonium. - Didn't you get contaminated? - Wow man, look at all the pretty colors. - What are we supposed to do now? - Oh I don't know I used to be a successful businessman. Now I've got acres of rotting insects. - No the bugs are still alive. Each ones about the size of a hamster. - Hesperia went to Marin County. What are we gonna do now? - Well I'm sure I don't know, I can't even take care of myself. - You're the new leader. We'll do anything you tell us to do. I thought I saw a spider. Jason. Wow, no wonder the worms have been growing so large. What does that stuff do to people?
