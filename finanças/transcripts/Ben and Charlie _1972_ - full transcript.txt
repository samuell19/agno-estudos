It's been three days since that man is waiting for you. That man. - Does he want to kill you? - He does not. He's a good man. - If you want to go back? - That man is a friend. There are many wanting to kill you here in Mexico. Hi, Charlie. Hi, Ben. - Maybe they're friends. - Oh, Ben, oh Charlie, that's it. So let's close the door. What was that my friend. You're in good shape, Charlie. In excellent shape. Looks like you're older. Can be because I'm watching you from below. You still owe me! Well, Charlie... You should not do that. Because friends are forever... What a Friend! It took us two years to get all that money. But... But it took you two days to lose it! - I tried to make an investment! We could have doubled the amount when we sold the herd of cattle. Yes, but not selling to a man of the law that sought you out for robbery! But he changed the appearance and I did not recognize him. But stop. I who do everything! Do everything! - You still have not paid me! - Sorry, Charlie, I'll pay. The guy could fool me... You know how these things happen. You're right... I waited two years for this. - Take off the belt. - Why? Ah! You want to let off some steam. Why didn't you just say so? Hang on! Is it worth fighting about the past? Ah! Stop rolling! Boxing is an art, Charlie. The problem is you haven't got reflexes. You want to get it in the head or should I split your chops? - Right. One... - Two! - I do not understand, Charlie. - You will understand. - You're very nervous. - Get up, you idiot! Charlie, this is a challenge. There goes a left! And a right! - A hook! - I'm going to hang your head on it! Hang on! You cannot hit somebody who is down. - So get up! - Let's talk a little, Charlie. Come and talk! - So it's a challenge. - I beat you! - So you're thinking! - Oh Suzana! do not cry for me! - Stop it. I thought they killed you! Did you know that prison is a place where you have the right ideas. Keep them. I know how we could win lots of money, Charlie. Are you listening? I am. We can make a fortune. I've got everything planned. We're going to be partners, let's go get rich, Charlie. You can be sure. Shut up. Look, with your shooting and the ideas I have! I got the whole thing figured out. You know, Charlie... Hey, Charlie! Where are you going? - Do you want to listen, partner? - Listen to you, saddlehead! If one of us goes east the other goes west, understand? Yes I understood! Go to hell! I can find four just like you... Five! Six! Seven! - Gentlemen, thank you. - Make your bets. I do not believe it! Seven. Gentlemen! I won again! Betting or not? Seven! Where did he go? Let's go after him! Hallelujah... Thank you. How pleasant it is for you to give me shelter, Hallelujah... This is not the hotel. Let's go. See you soon. See you! It's all right. Are you ready? You go west and I head east! Understood? Wait for me... Goodbye, idiot! Now a pose! You can smile! - Ah! Let's go, young lady! Two little things! - No, I do not. Do you not you want it? If it is not with you I will not get anything young. It is not enough A pleasure, my friends! Whisky. A cold beer. - No luck, my friend? - I was looking? - How lucky I was with him, with him. - What do you think, oh! - I want to tell you something, come on. - What? Come on! Hey, buddy! There are people, I have not finished yet! I paid for the services, you cannot enter! - I'll be late! - Don't be in such a hurry. It's still going to take me an hour! One of the players is a cheater, a real thug. Wait, what? What are you saying? He is cheating with the pack. - Son of a bitch! - Stay calm! Calm down! - You will not get anything back this way. - Well, all right... - Do you still have money there? - I still have about $ 500. Lend it to me, just a minute! We will divide the profits in two equal parts later. Youl want to recover what you lost, right? But if one of them is a cheater, how will you win? I'm smarter! Oh, ahh !! - Right? - All right, be careful. - But you better win! - I will not lose. Let's go. Look, Daddy. It's not hygienic, but you'll feel like a millionaire. Is there anybody against me taking somebody else's place? Sit down. - I'm sorry, but... - Afraid? What are you thinking? Well, if that's the case, let's start. Give the cards. And so, you always play together? Is someone stealing? Cold, cold, hot, hot... Burning! - Does everyone want to have an advantage? - She must have slipped. Deal. Cut Thank you. Start the game. It's open. I'm in. 100. 200. - 200. - I play. I'm out of the game. What's up? - Cards? - One. The top one. Right. Three. 100. 300. - Double that. What do we do now? 300. Double. It's a Swiss watch. - I have an ace - Me too. There are two of them! Wow! Each one has three! - But it's impossible to have six. - Yes, but how? - How can one have three? - Shut up! You still have a card. Each one has four aces! - Stop! We are the security! - Just a moment. You know very well that I left with the four aces! Yes, but you also know that I was a strong adversary? Where do you want to get hit? Security! I paid for the service! And I'm not done yet! Now it's going to brake! - Look at Charlie. - What? - It's better to get out of here. - Yes. I think so too, come on. We will do the following. You'll hop on now and get off at the last stop. I'll wait for the northbound stage, got it? Do you know what I think? I think that you are nothing but a tramp. A second homeless category, which is worth nothing. - That's right. - That's it, my friend. I think it's better to be a second-rate hobo... ... than being a smart guy with a bullet in his head. Well well well... Come on, beautiful. We travelled together the last 160 km and are still far from San Diego. There is nothing wrong with me. I just want to get to know you better, nothing wrong with it or is it? They serve chilled beer here at the post station. I have something to tell you. Be more careful. Yes but... Do not call attention. Something can happen to you. It is a matter of life or death. Let's go, but this is not smelling good. Come on! - May I know what's going on? - Of course. Help! - No, wait! Still not sure! - I'll take the risk. - Hang on! - I know. Okay, she only had a way. -A beautiful day, no? - It would, if it were not so many passengers. Look, I do not bite! You may not bite but were bitten by a very bad thing. - In disguise. - My compliments, it's perfect. You look exactly like one bum fighter who was never lucky. It may be true, but I have the strange feeling that we know each other. Unfortunately you're right. It was in front of a preacher and I said: Yes, and you did not say anything. And when I turned my head... ... had fled the church. Sarah, you're still very angry with me? - No. Of course not. Currently I consider myself very lucky. You're right. You know, you have not changed at all. - And neither did you, Ben. - No doubt, I was giving you a compliment. Without doubt. - And you, what are you doing now? - Same as always. Remember? I'm a prostitute. Great Ben Bellows... I am a woman of courage, without fear of men and arms, it is true. - We will not start again. - Of course not, I don't have a desire to. You did not even notice that I. I did not even ask what you were doing. I did not need to, I know. You're on the run, Ben. Thinking you are behind a very important thing. Money, glory, success... ... you don't even know it yourself. Don't you realize that you're only trying to escape? Sarah, you do not understand what I want Nor did you ever try to understand me. As one promissory note that says: "Ben Bellows you have the right to be free, rich and happy." I tried to find my chance, conquer what should be mine. You can find that black cape that everyone finds at the end of life. I'd rather take chances. So, you going to travel too? - Well, I would, but... - Yes I understand. Could you help me? Listen, Ben... I have $ 200 here that I don't need. Maybe I can help you. You're an angel, Sarah. But do not judge a book by its cover. The only thing I do not need is money. Sarah! Expect me! It can wait! One day I'll stop at your door in a chariot of ten white horses! I'll be in there! With lots of money! And a bunch of silk dresses! And I'll bring you lots of flowers, too! Sarah! Will you wait for me? What happened? You're not going south anymore? This is my problem unless you're looking for trouble. Come on, let's inside. We are in need of people. Did you say, us? - What are you thinking, Charlie? - That's my problem. - Are you looking for trouble? - No, partner. No. The stage coach! Where is the stage coach? The stage coach? Where is...? The coach! Where is the stage coach? See that cloud of dust? That is all that is left of the coach. Thank you sir. Stop! Wait for me! Do not go! Please! Red Rock! Ten minutes stop! Red Rock! One stop that has water and a bathroom on the trip! Ten minutes! Enjoy it now, people. The next stop is 300 kilometers away. Okay, let's have a drink. I'll have a drink, what about a beer? Yes, we hardly have enough money to make our trip. We only have money to go to Phoenix. We can steal something. Let's go to jail. What else can we do? In this city, besides fighting? I guess this is going to be here. Prepare for anything. - We will not find anything here. - Ah! You do not know anything... I'll think of something, you'll see. - I think it's good! Or I put a bullet in your head. Where are you going? I'll check out that gun shop over there. Just look. I'm going to look, nothing wrong, nothing wrong. Oh . Beautiful day, no? Are you going to ask for something, sir? - What's it? - The barrel, defective. Impossible. Let me see. - You see right? - Yeah, it's perfect. I can even see the bullet inside. Well, continue looking at it without blinking. Very slowly, if you do not want to let it stop inside your eye. Do not move! Do not move! Stop there! Quiet! Raise your hands! With your back to the wall! You there! Come on! Put the money in the bag! You help him! Come on! Quick! Hurry up! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! - What's it? - I robbed the bank! Thieves! They robbed the bank! - Safe! - You take it! - Everybody inside! - Get out of the way! He's crazy! - Thank you, Charlie! That was a good shot! - Yes, you will be the next. Get your hands off me! Let go! Get your hands off! Round up a posse! - They took our money. - They took our money. I get those two, even if it's out of town! Now follow me, come on! It was the only chance I had. If I told you, Charlie... ... I was going to rob a bank. I could already imagine what you were going to tell me. - You're crazy! - That's right! That's why I wanted to make it a surprise. It all worked out, Charlie. All very nice! All right! With this move you made me a bad guy in two minutes! Ah! Stop complaining. Come on, see. Tell me what I put in this bag. Half of that money is yours, partner. - Hey, Ben! - Ha! - Did you count it? - Yes! - Is there more than ten? - About 20! - 20 thousand! - No, 20 sheriffs! We never make it, Charlie! - Charlie! What are you doing? - Get them off, Ben. Get them off! - But what are you doing? Come on! Come on! Gather the money! It was the only way to get them off our tracks. - What an idea! Next time you have an idea like this, I want to know before. That goes for you too, when thinking of robbing a bank! In fact, you were totally terrified! So it seemed since all the American cavalry was after us. I was afraid! You'd be even more nervous when they get us. Now get out of here, it's my turn. - Washing the laundry first, hey? - And you do not even wash properly! - You washed your underwear? - I'm a gentleman, I don't wear underwear. Hi, good night. Oh my God! Look, stay there, boy! Where is your little friend? Look around, he cannot be far. And you're going to tell me everything now. What are you doing? I didn't expect you so quickly... I'm not prepared, I am in mourning for my husband. - Are you leaving already? - Is this the photo of the deceased? That is why he died. Get up, come on! Listen, I'm a good person, but when I use this... You do not even want to imagine. All right, bum, now, tell me where your friend is or we are gonna kill you. I'm the boss here, Walker! I do not like your methods, or what I see. And I do not like you. Do not forget what they did. They robbed a bank in my city. Very well, I think it's better he tells us where he hid the money. - What money? - Do not play smart. The $ 25,000 you stole. Where is it? We did not get the money... - Where did you hide it? - So what? You want to blame us? Now I know why you went through all that trouble? You think we might have talked, right? - What are you talking about? - Nothing, just that l... The sheriff and his men know where the $ 25000 are. Too bad your friend is not here to keep you company. Yes, it's a shame, he is always far away when there is hanging. - Do not worry, I'll get him too. - Yes... ... it is going to take a lot of work, a lot of work with him, liar. I wish you a good way to hell. Responsible citizens, very responsible! I'll get you! I'll get you! And I'm going to kill you like an animal! It's a horrible desert, Brother Brawn! Hot as hell. But the day is wonderful brother. Doesn't it open your heart to see such a beautiful day? You have to practice what you preach. Psalm 2, verse 10. Brother Charles... What happened to your soul Charles? Open your heart. I wanted to split your head open to see what's inside. Now I'm a thug, we're two cheap thugs. Robbing a bank was not the enough, he had to kill a sheriff! But the money was returned and I killed in legitimate defense. Yes, but we'll never prove it. Everything they know about us is that we are two perverse bandits. Do you know what I think? That it is part of your destiny, Charlie. Thank you, idiot. What do you think we are? Thugs, let's take advantage of this. Eye witnesses describe Charlie as having black hair and a beard. The other, whose name is unknown is about two meters tall... ... has blonde hair and is often laughing for no reason. Your description is very good. I will send it to all authorities. - I do not believe it! - What is wrong sheriff? I would have never thought that the Feds would bother with this case. A bank robbery, a sheriff dead, a preacher attacked. In a week, these two young people screwed up the authorities of this state, they attacked the economic power and the church. But I don't think their life is gonna be so easy from now on. - Smith! - Yes, sir, I have arrived. - Ten minutes late again, no? - Yes sir. - You know where you work and what? - Yes sir. Now go to your desk! Come and work! This may be the last time I'm warning you. -Yes sir! -You should have finished the report. - But I'm done. - What? - I worked on them all night. - But I will not tolerate your delays! - Was I clear, Smith? Was I clear? - Yes sir. - Good morning, pastor. - Yes... - Good morning, my son. - What can I do for you? Well, I decided to build a new church. And I came about some... financing. Ah, financing... Smith! How many times have I told you that you do not take care of these things? Thank you, Smith. What do you need, pastor? - $ 30,000 - Oh, not a lot of money. But I imagine that you can naturally provide us with a good guarantee. Of course. I do not think they know what is happening, this is an assault. - Have courage and open the safe. - And give us the money! - Otherwise... - No! Kill me if you want. If that's the way you like it. - I'll get the key. - He's fooling you. This drawer is the one that holds the gun. The key is here. Look. - The boy is honest. - He's a good man. Our Director is a little forgetful. - Take it all. - Yeah, but keep an eye on the door. - Come on, boy, get it all. - Yes sir. Right. C'mon C'mon! - Smith! - Yes sir? - You're fired! - Thank you sir. - Smith! - Yes sir? - He's hired. - Thank you, reverent. - How much do you want? - 3% is fine, sir. - The normal salary of a bank. - Alright. Come on, reverent! Smith! Smith! You can't leave just like that! Sorry sir. You're right. I was leaving without saying goodbye. - Wait for me! Do not leave me here! - Get your horse! - But, my horse... - Who the hell cares? - I do not even know how to ride. - You have much to learn. Let's go! Help! Wait for me! Hold on! Reverent! - I know you'll get them. - They were just as black as charcoal, just like your eye. The pastor was a blond man and the taller one had a threatening look. Yes sir! They were two bad guys. violent and murderous! Were these the men? Look closely. Yes, there is a certain similarity. Send me 2000 copies. With unknown name, whereabouts unknown, 5000 dollars of reward, alive or dead. This will draw the attention of bounty hunters, sir. That's exactly what I want. Yes, I know you very much want to get it these two guys... ... but it can also bring many dangerous people to our city. The important thing is that the two may be among them. Three percent of the 45'200 gives me a fair sum of money. Here's my part. What are you saying, Three Percent? Are you complaining on your part? You gotta be kidding! I never had so much money, I'm a rich man! It was the money of others. Yes, that makes me suffer. - Suffer? - Of course. When you take money out of a bank and it just grows old. It doesn't incrue interest when its just sitting around, it stopped working. You have the idea of how much you can earn with all that money in a bank? - You want to deposit it in a bank? - But, of course. - You are crazy, Three Percent! - Forget it, this... ... money already has a destination. We have to spend it all. You're reading my thoughts. No, clever head! First of all, we need to get rid of the horses. - Cause they are robbed - He is right. We have to buy at least six horses, so we have always one in reserve. ... and then we need also new ones... ...we need weapons to start. And we have to look respectable, We have to buy a house. Since we have no family, We have to have a place to live. Do you have anything else? What else do we need to do? Yes, tomorrow morning... Tomorrow morning? We are wasting a lot of time. - What do you think about these guys? - They must be from here. - This face looks threatening, Charlie. - That's right... they look pretty wicked. Are you armed? - I missed.] - That's not funny! - Striking resemblence, don't you think? -Yes, they look quite familiar. Now that we already introduced ourselves and showed our credentials... why don't we band together? We thought you're a bunch of bounty-killer, no, Charlie? Yes. We are the biggest bunch of crooks you have ever met. Hey, mouse! Do not you want to drink a tequila, little mouse? - No, thank you. I do not drink. - You do not you drink tequila, little mouse? - He only drinks water. - Water! Drink your water, Three Percent! Foolish! But not bad! You still have not seen anything yet! What do you say, Charlie? If everything goes wrong we can enter a circus, no? Attention. Rien ne vas plus. No, I already warned you, sir. No more bets. Zero! Zero! All on the house. What are you doing? Sorry, but my friend is a little nervous. Unfortunately, he does not even knows what a zero means. It is made like a circle, monsieur. - The round number, sir. - Look! Quiet! Are you deaf? He said to be quiet. Look! Quiet, do not try anything! And keep your hands up. Come on, lay there! - Did you not hear what I said? - But I'm the cashier! No, now I'm the cashier. Hands up now. Go ahead. This is our captain! Whoever knocks down a candle, gets a hole in the head. Captain, the gold is yours. The watch worthy of a General. - Pure gold! - There's no General here. Nor is there any Captain. Let's go, General. The bank failed. Rien ne vas plus. They joined up with Honeken and his pack. Weird. - I thought they were smarter. - What you mean? The advantage was all theirs. We did not know their names... We did not even have pictures of them. But now... they joined three well-known bandits... whose faces and names appear in every town of this state. They did not realize the mess they got themselves into. - Here are the shares. - Are you a specialist? - Mister nimble fingers. - Thank you. Only this time count the notes slowly and well... and in front of me. Yes, but you don't really mean it. Slowly and in front of me. Do you understand? Yes sir. Hey, calm down. I trust him. But I do not. Look, I don't think your opinion is worth very much. No! - For me the matter is closed. - No, it's not! You see, I think now you can see who's the boss here. I think it's time for us to separate, take your horses. And don't appear here within the next ten days. And the next time you come we set an appointment for our next job. Right. See you. - Well, I guess that's it. - Where are you going? They are going north, so we better head south. - You did something clever, Ben. - Do not leave, we have to talk. I don't like going to bed with my Colt under the pillow. - I've discovered this for a long time. - Yes. Poor Ben, he's just a turd. And if you continue to associate with this kind of people, you will soon turn up dead. You're afraid of getting hurt. - I do not understand what you're saying. - I will explain. I almost died fighting with those two guys... and you did not help me, Charlie, because you were scared to death. Yes... I thought that you could handle it alone. It was fun, wasn't it?. - You were beautiful. What are you doing with my pistol, Charlie? You know, Ben, I can't say that l envy you with all your responsibilities but when you're boss you gotta know all the rules. For example? First rule: When you're the boss you better not walk around without your gun on you. Thank you. Now give me the gun. Second rule: If you want to be the boss, do not turn your back on your enemies. Accountant, give me the money! - I thought you were my friend. - You are not supposed to have friends. A boss cannot trust anybody, especially when... money is involved. - You're a coward! That's what you are - And you're a bloody idiot. I hope you have learned your lesson, because from now on... you have to do everything by yourself. As for that coward called Charlie. You wanna find him go to Silvertown. All right, Charlie! Stop there! And one more thing, make sure that nobody tempers with your equipment. It's part of the grind of being a boss. It's all part of the grind. Miserable, traitorous, selfish bastard. God be with you. Could you change it for me? - You're here, pastor. - Peace, brother. Ben, they're all over place. Everyone on the bench is wearing guns. - Let's be quiet for a while. - We can not do this alone! - We still got 50000 from the last job. - And we should put them into a bank... and live off the interest? We have to be very cautious. No major bank within a 100 mile radius is unguarded any more. Armed guards instead of the employees and outside the riders are waiting. It is very clear that they are expecting us to come. Should we shit into our pants? We do have weapons too... ...we can also surprise them. - No. I am not thinking of causing a bloodbath. I don't want any gunfights. Keep calm boys, I'm sure the boss has a better idea. Otherwise, what kind of boss would he be? Listen. - About 50,000 are still there from the last one... - Now he will propose to live off the interest. It's not such a bad idea. Listen, Ben... If we put those $ 50000 in a ank, with an interest rate of... three percent. - Look, we have a genius in math. - Do you think we'll agree to that? No, but we can pull off a job just the same. They are waiting for us in the big cities, in the most important cities. And instead we rob a little bank in small towns. - In these places the coffers are empty. - But it is money, and we do not take risks. If it's the best you can do not count on me. What a bunch of idiots... Federal deposits are always in banks that are in small towns. We can get half a million dollars. ... now there' a place... that everyone speaks of very good! - Silvertown. - And why did you choose Silvertown? Because it's a city that sucks! A shit town! The worst city who has been created all over the West... ... the federal agents don't know what they're doing... ... they put the money somewhere where no one will look. A miserable place where no one wants to live! Either those who are afraid or are very dumb to get out of there... ... the silver is gone and the mine was closed... ... but the staff stayed there in Silvertown, doing nothing. - Sheriff, two strangers have arrived. - I don't care, they can get lost. Come on, play! Hi, how are you? What are you drinking? Rat poison, you need to clean these up a bit. This is worse than a pigsty. Left over, you can bring what I drink. What I always do. Two clean glasses, sir. Bravo. If you can serve us some whisky we will appreciate it greatly. So you came to Silvertown? Yes, and I believe that we will return a second time. Have a good time. - This isn't exactly the grand hotel. I can not say that, but we have a bunch of empty houses, just pick one. I mean, we do not have much comfort, but if you don't mind roughing it. I do not want it. But what do they have? A lot of strange people walking around here. And l, I'm not armed. - Did you hear that one? He's not armed. - I do not care. This city is really over. Your turn to play. If you're looking for a good rifle, I can get you one. - I have a store right next to the bank. - Beside the bank? - The only one in Silvertown. - Ah, that's good. - What time does the bank open? - The bank's open at three o'clock. - Incredible, a clock that plays music? - And made of gold too. - Did you get it? - Gift from a friend. God knows where he is now. - How much do I owe? - Half a dollar. - Three percent! - Yes sir. - Keep the change. - He has a suitcase full of dollars! - Do not tell me I'm going crazy. - And what can I do? Do you want me to... ... keep playing. Half a dollar. No. Two dollars. I won! I got to win! Some win, some lose. Nothing can be done. Hey, clown! With the compliments of the house. $ 52,300 and you said that you want to deposit all this here? Is your bank safe? - Yes, sir, but generally... - Your safe is secure? Of course sir. The famous model 86 of Henschel Schuster, approved by... the state bank - With all these robberies... I'll feel better when... I mean... One second, your money is under protection of this Silvertown bank... and the state of California. With this receipt you can withdraw money from anywhere you wish. In New York, in San Francisco. Even traveling, in any city. It seems to be very efficient. - I think so, too. - I'll put the money immediately... in my hands. Our boss's plan was perfect, no, guys? Clever and careful. Except for one little slip. Damn... Ben! Ben. - Smith! - They're running! Hang on! The bandits will flee, They only have one bullet in that rifle. Shut up! The money! The money! I'll get it! I'll get the suitcase, you idiot! Sheriff, they, they're firing off! - Yes sir! - Wait a second. I'm going to take my star and I'll do the my job, I'm not a sheriff. Etc. etc. etc. And now get going! Take it. You better send a telegram, no? Ben! Where are you? Ben, where are you? Ben! Smith! Glad you did not die, Ben. They did not run away, did they? No, they will not run away. The money is still out there. And they're not going anywhere. - I'd love to help you. - You already helped... ... could have been better. - No, no... It was stupid of me, I just wanted to deposit the money and have my... family and live... ... of income. - Interest... - Those three percent? Yes... It was good to meet you... Silvertown. I've never heard of it. Where is Silvertown? Stay here, sir. About 50 kilometers from here. - It's a ghost town. - You'll get there in two hours. Let's get the men together. We'll leave right away. Let's go. Sheriff! You will not believe it! I got to send a message. The sheriffs will be here in two hours. Calm down, it's me! The money! The money! They took our money! Captain! - We can stop them, I know. - Shut up. Pay attention! In two hours the sheriffs will be here. Now you've got your money! Why don't you leave from here? Because they killed Three Percent. He was our friend, I guess you do not care! Why don't you leave, Charlie! All at once! Forever! I just don't beat you up now, because it would make too much noise... and they would end up listening! Go away, die there out with that empty brain of yours. Charlie... you were right about the three, now I know. But if you help me Charlie we can still make it. I'm annoyed because they killed Three Percent. - Do you understand, Charlie? - Of course. Charlie, you were always pretty good in solving things. I think I have the power to solve this too. Beat it, Charlie while there is still time. Go, go! But I'll go to the end. The price does not matter. All right, Ben. Goodbye, wind head. I come out a winner! I'm serious, I'll do it. Hey, Charro! I'm here! Charro, I'm here! Here! Charro! Here, you idiot! Turn! Charro! Let me go! Hey, Honeken! I'm tired of this situation! - You hear me? - What do you want? In 10 minutes the sheriffs will arrive here with a group of hungry wolves. And? How about if we would reach an agreement? We are the only ones left! Smith is dead... ... and also Charro! We are even. Let's have the argument another time. I just want one of the horses and get out of here. I leave you the money. So do you agree? Make up your mind... You got the horse... ...and I got the money! How about an exchange? - I was hoping for this, Ben! - How's that? Cause you have no more bullets. I'm waiting for an answer! There you have my answer. Come on, Ben. Stay with the horse and I with the money. What a bad face. Why don't we chuck the weapons. Let's get on with it. You know, my friend Charlie said that you have the poison of a rattlesnake... bad as ever. But, I always told Charlie... ...that you are a worm, a coward... ... a guy who can shoot people in the back. But he was wrong, right, Honeken? The sheriffs are coming! They are coming! So many sheriffs, you hear me? Come here and see! I telegraphed, I did it! Come on! We have some guests! I warned you! Me, Eddie Fogerthy! I sent the telegram! - Let's go fast! - Come this way! I said, come this way! You can trust me, I know what I'm doing. Come on! I know this one place like the palm of my hand! - It's beautiful here, isn't it? - Very spacious. Come on! Stop it! We escaped from them, didn't we? We got rid of them, Charlie. What do you think? We are in the middle of a desert, but it's good for a mouse like you. Dude you don't need to exaggerate, it's a little dry. A few more hundred kilometers and we are out of here. - There is nothing here. We got $ 50,000. - And we're going to die. And another $ 50,000 if we can change that bank receipt. Let's go! We will not waste time! Get up and let's move on. - We'll never get out of here! - What are you talking about? I'm in shape. - Shut up! - I've always been in good shape. Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! A stage! Come on, Charlie! Get it, Charlie! Come on! - Hey, hold on! - Wait! Hang on! - Now you can do it! - Come on, Charlie! - What happened? - I did it, come on! Hold on! Our suitcase! - It was your idea, was not it? - No. - What do you think? - Will be all right. That's right. - I know. You're angry, are not you? - Yes, I'm very angry. But, you're cool, Charlie. And nice! Yes... Charlie... I'm cool, don't you think? I'll kill you! Calm down, Charlie. It will work... next time it will work right, I mean it, Charlie. Listen, I have a perfect plan now, Charlie. It will be infallible. Look Charlie, if we get to the next city, I assure you, it will work. They cannot stop us, Charlie? They cannot stop us!
