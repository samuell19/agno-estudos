[Barking] Adult Toni: ROCKPORT, MAINE, IS THE ONLY HOME I'VE EVER KNOWN. I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT SPRING IN 1962. MY FAMILY'S BIG ADVENTURE WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN. DO YOU, MISS CLUCK CLUCK, TAKE WALTER PIGEON TO LOVE, HONOR, AND OBEY AS LONG AS FOREVER AND EVER? [COOS] COME ON. [COOS] WELL, DO YOU? MISS CLUCK CLUCK, WAKE UP. COME ON, IT'S YOUR WEDDING. WELL, I PRONOUNCE YOU MAN AND WIFE. Adult Toni: ANY ANIMAL THAT HAD LOST ITS WAY OR JUST NEEDED A FRIEND WAS ALWAYS WELCOMED AT OUR HOUSE. BUT THE ANIMALS WERE TAME COMPARED TO MY BROTHER STEVE AND MY SISTER PAULA. I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU WOULD EAT THOSE THINGS, PERIOD, NEVER MIND FOR BREAKFAST. SEE, THAT SHOWS HOW MUCH YOU KNOW. RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT TWINKIES HAVE A SHELF LIFE OF OVER 27 YEARS. THEREFORE, IF I CONTINUE TO EAT A DAILY RATION OF THESE GOLDEN, CREAM-FILLED DELIGHTS, I COULD LIVE INDEFINITELY, YOU KNOW. MMM... HA HA! MOM, WHERE'S DAD? I NEED HOT-LUNCH MONEY. THERE ARE LUNCHES ALL MADE UP IN THE FRIDGE, PAULA. STEVE, HAVE YOU SEEN YOUR FATHER? Adult Toni: DAD SAID MOM HAD THE PATIENCE OF JOB. SHE WAS WIFE, LAWMAKER, ZOOKEEPER, AND MOTHER, AND SHE WAS ALSO THE ONLY REAL GROWN-UP IN THE HOUSE. JUST A SECOND. OHH! HELLO? MRS. McCANN, HOW ARE-- I SAW THEM CUTTING THROUGH MY BACKYARD AGAIN, [GROWLING] WHICH IS TRESPASSING. I'M VERY SORRY-- YOU PEOPLE ARE A MENACE. THIS IS TONI'S REPORT CARD, WHICH SHE CONVENIENTLY LEFT AT SCHOOL. AND I DO NEED TO REMIND YOU THAT TONI STILL DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN CLASS AND SHE DOES NOT JOIN IN WITH THE OTHER CHILDREN AT RECESS. [RUFF RUFF] [GRRR] Adult Toni: AND THEN THERE WAS DAD. DO YOU SEE 'EM? Dad: YEAH. Adult Toni: HE WAS MY HERO. HE HAD A SPECIAL WAY WITH ANIMALS. I THOUGHT IT WAS MAGIC, AND ALL THESE YEARS LATER, I'M CERTAIN OF IT. YOU KNOW, YOU WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING. I MEAN, IT'S ABOUT TIME THEY GOT HITCHED. THE NEIGHBORS WERE STARTING TO TALK. WHAT DO YOU THINK WENT WRONG WITH HIM AND HER? WELL, MAYBE HIM AND HER AIN'T A HIM AND HER. YOU MEAN, I PUT THE DRESS ON THE WRONG ONE? WELL, WALTER WOULD KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT THAN I WOULD. Paula: OK, FINE. I GUESS YOU WANT ME TO BE A SOCIAL OUTCAST DAD, CAN I PLEASE HAVE MONEY FOR A HOT LUNCH? Dad: WHAT DID YOUR MOM SAY? SHOULDN'T YOU BE ABOUT HALFWAY TO SCHOOL NOW YOURSELF? I'M NOT GOING. I HATE SCHOOL. WELL, I HATED SCHOOL, TOO. HOWEVER, I'M GONNA BE LATE, AND YOU'RE GONNA BE IN A WORLD OF MANURE IF WE DON'T BOTH GET GOING, SO OFF YOU GO. [GIGGLING] Girl: ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

AH, COME ON, BILLY, IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANYTHING. IT COULD HAVE BEEN AN OUTBOARD MOTOR. IT COULD HAVE BEEN A SHARK. OH, IT WAS A SEAL, ALL RIGHT. I CUT IT OUT MYSELF.

HE'S ATTRACTED A RECORD NUMBER OF VISITORS TO HIS NEW HOME AT THE EASTERN AQUARIUM NEAR BOSTON. ANDRE'S NIGHTLY SHOWS AT ROCKPORT'S DOCKSIDE, MADE HIM A NATIONAL CELEBRITY. BUT THE SEAL'S OWNER, HARRY WHITNEY, PLACED HIM IN THE AQUARIUM LAST FALL FOR HIS OWN SAFETY. ALFRED DAVIS, THE AQUARIUM'S DIRECTOR, SAYS THAT ANDRE IS WELL-LOVED AND CARED FOR AND SEEMS TO BE ADAPTING WELL TO CAPTIVITY. COME ON. IT'S A LONG DRIVE TO BOSTON. AND I KNOW ANDRE IS ANXIOUS TO SEE YOU. DAD, I'VE BEEN THINKING. YEAH, ABOUT WHAT? WELL, MAYBE ANDRE WOULD LIKE IT MORE WITH THE OTHER SEALS. HE IS A WILD ANIMAL, YOU KNOW, SO I THINK HE'D LIKE IT BETTER IN THE WILD. WELL, MISS WHITNEY, WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND? Adult Toni: IT WAS A LONG TRIP TO BOSTON. I KNEW I'D MADE THE HARDEST DECISION OF MY LIFE. I WAS ABOUT TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO MY BEST FRIEND FOR THE LAST TIME. THAT'S IT. GREAT. OK. OK. GOOD. THANKS. I'M GONNA MISS HIM. WE'VE BECOME GOOD FRIENDS, HUH? [WHIMPERS] I THINK HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO LIVE IN THE WILD IF HE WANTS TO. WELL, SOME OF HIS OWN WILL PREPARE HIM FOR THE WINTER. WE REALLY APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE FOR HIM. WELL, ANDRE, YOU'LL BE OK. LOVE YOU. OK, THERE WE GO. Harry: THAT'A BOY, ANDRE. GO ON, ANDRE. DAD... DO YOU THINK ANDRE'S MAKING NEW FRIENDS WITH THE WILD SEALS? I HOPE SO, HONEY. HEY, HARRY. YEAH? THAT WAS DWAYNE IN NANTUCKET. HE SAYS HIS FRIEND BUDDY CLEMMONS SPOTTED ANDRE OFF RHODE ISLAND. CRIMINY. I GUESS HE DECIDED TO HEAD FOR SOUTHERN WATERS AFTER ALL, HUH? GO ON. YOU KNOW, DAD, I KINDA MISS ANDRE. I DO. NO WAY, AL. YOU PROBABLY JUST SAW A SEAL THAT LOOKS LIKE HIM. BUDDY CLEMMONS THINKS HE SAW HIM OFF RHODE ISLAND THIS MORNING. YOU'RE LISTENING TO SULLY SULLIVAN ON WROC, THE STATION TO LISTEN TO FOR ANDRE UPDATES. IF YOU THINK YOU'VE SPOTTED HIM, CALL IN ON THE ROC HOTLINE AT 555-1120. IN THE LAST 2 DAYS, THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE SIGHTINGS OF ROCKPORT'S FAMOUS SEAL. I CAN'T FIND THE BALL SCORES ANYWHERE. [STATIC] LOOK, ANDRE GOT PRETTY FAMOUS IN HIS DAY. BELIEVE ME, EVERY SEAL PEOPLE SEE FOR AWHILE IS GOING TO BE ANDRE. YEAH, BUT MR. WHITNEY, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE SIGHTINGS ON THE EASTERN SEABOARD IN THE LAST 2 DAYS? SURE. MARYLAND, CANADA. I EXPECT THEY'LL BE CALLING ME FROM CALIFORNIA NEXT. [SEAL BARKING] THALICE, IT'S LOU DOWN AT FRIENDSHIP BAY. HE'S ON HIS WAY. HURRY UP! DIDYA HEAR? WHAT'S GOING ON? HE'S COMING. YAY! WHOO! HEY, ANDRE! HEY, ANDRE. WELCOME HOME. [RASPBERRY] Adult Toni: MANY YEARS AGO, A SEAL CALLED ANDRE MADE HIS FIRST HISTORIC SWIM HOME, AND HIS LIFE BECAME LEGEND. EVERY WINTER, HE LIVED THE LIFE OF A COUNTRY GENTLEMAN AT THE AQUARIUM. EVERY SPRING, MY DAD SET HIM FREE. AND EVERY TIME, ANDRE MADE THE 250-MILE JOURNEY HOME TO SPEND THE SUMMER WITH US-- HIS FAMILY. BY THE TIME ANDRE WAS 24-YEARS OLD, HE COULD HARDLY SEE, BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP HIM FROM COMPLETING HIS FINAL TRIP. IN ALL MY JOURNEYS SINCE MY YOUTH, AND ON ALL THE JOURNEYS I HAVE AHEAD OF ME, I KNOW I'LL NEVER FIND A BETTER FRIEND THAN ANDRE. ? OOH-OOH ? ? OOH-OOH OOH-OOH ? ? THANK YOU ? ?
