You ready? Okay. Let's get this over with. (LIGHT KEYBOARD ATMOSPHERE MUSIC) (KNOCKING) Hey! Welcome to the seventies! (LAUGHING) INTERVIEWER: Is that when you first met? Oh no. We met a few months before then. When Bradford first moved to New York. (JUBILANT PIANO MUSIC) He was a small town chorus boy ready to be devoured. He got cast in this god awful musical that I designed the sets for. (BASS HEAVY FUNK ATMOSPHERE MUSIC) BRADFORD VO: Oh god no. Vinny and I never slept together. Did he tell you that? No, it was much deeper than that. He was a true friend. (FLUTE ACCOMPANIMENT) (PHONE RINGING) STAGE HAND: Phone call for you, Vinny! Hello? Again? Really? (LAUGHING) Yeah, okay. I'll be right there. Thanks for bailing me out, Vinny. You have the worst luck in the toilets. I know, I don't wanna talk about it. I told you, just take a dirty diaper with you, and when the police come in you can show it to them and explain that you are incontinent. That is disgusting. Yeah, but it works. You've really never been to the baths? BRADFORD VO: Days went by. Months. I think I spent more time at the baths than I did at my apartment. I know Vinny did. VINNY VO: It's not true. I went there occasionally. Everybody did. It was a different time. Blackened soul. It won't come out. Black ink. It won't wash out. They haven't washed these floors since 1888. It's the black stain. See what I'm talking about? Back of my neck? You see these black fingerprints? You think I'm crazy don't you? Coming back here one more time. You think it's funny don't you? Really it ain't. They send the most handsome ones, the ones like you. Yeah. And then they get us to blow them. They take their hands, put them on the back of our heads, and we go down on them. We have the most delicious time just going up and down on those sweet cocks. And then we all know that they've got their fingers dipped in that indelible ink. The kind that won't come out. And then they bring in the raid. Yeah, the raid. They bring them in and they line us up. And they look at the back of our necks and they look for these black fingerprints. And any one of us with the black stain they arrest for lewd conduct. But they ain't gonna get me, oh no. 'Cause this shit's gonna get washed out. I'm gonna wash this shit out. I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. No no, they ain't gonna get me. I'm too smart for them. And I'm too strong. They ain't gonna get me. No sir. No no no. No no no no no. BRADFORD: Time stood still there. That's a hard thing to walk away from. VINNY VO: Once in a while we did get out. For a show or club opening. The first discos didn't have names. We called it The 13th Floor because that's where it was. You had to be a member to get in. And they didn't serve alcohol. The elevator was always broken. In those days, we would do anything. That was part of the appeal. Excitement. Finding a little bit of Heaven amongst the Hell. Watch out, watch out. (SYNTHPOP ATMOSPHERE MUSIC) Where is everybody? It's early. Wait, you designed this space? Yes. Bullshit. You did nothing. I got us memberships didn't I? Best thing about this club is that Everhard is right across the street. Shall we? Yes. Where's my shirt? Here. Wear this. (GASPING) Shit. Bradford! Bradford! Bradford! I'm coming. Bradford! Bradford! BRADFORD: You are gonna get me kicked out of this building. Oh hush, they love the drama. Who's they? You might as well keep them. They're my spare keys. Oh, I brought these for you. Thank you, Vinny. They're plastic, so you don't have to put them in water and they won't die. How thoughtful. Don't you wanna know where I got these? I don't think so. You mind if I take a shower? I just couldn't go home to mom smelling like formaldehyde. (CHUCKLING) Of course not. (PHONE RINGING) Who could that be at this ungodly hour? If it's for me, I'm not here. Hello? Oh hi mom, yes it's me. I don't know, I just haven't found the right girl yet. What am I, chopped liver? Well I should go. We have rehearsal today. Yes, mom. Love you too. You didn't tell them about your leg. They don't need to know about that. Really? Yes. Isn't it time you got home to your mommy? Okay okay, I'll shut up. I'll never dance again. Nonsense. It's what the doctor said. What does he know? More than you. The hell am I gonna do now? (SNICKERING) Come on, let's go to a movie. What movie? VINNY: Come on! (FUNKY ATMOSPHERE MUSIC) BRADFORD: What the hell is this? Trust me. Good afternoon. Two tickets please. Thank you. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) There aren't even any English subtitles. How are we supposed to understand this? I don't think there's much of a plot. Shhh! (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) That's my cue. You coming? I gotta take a leak. Hey, do not leave without me. I won't. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Sorry. Don't be sorry. Don't get too close. Get in the row behind me (MOANING) Need some help, darling? No, I can manage. Thank you. Want me to shake it for you? No thanks. It's okay. Don't be shy. I'm here if you need me. Don't touch me. Do you want me to turn the water on for you? That usually helps. Sure. No hot water? Cheap bitch. I get off on you guys watching me get off. (WATER RUNNING) I can turn you on. No charge. Free love, baby. Free motherfucking love. (URINATING) Success. (FLUSHING) Watch out for the razors. What? The razor blades. (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (WATER RUNNING) You won't feel a thing. Unless your pants are a thin material, or too tight. Then your ass is gonna get razored. Ouch. Thanks. That's why I wear a dress. No pockets to razor. And carry a purse. With a brick in it. Comes in handy in case someone tries to fuck with me. Oh, and to kill rats. You want to party? No, not right now. Maybe later? Okay. I'll be waiting, cookies. Those are some nice cookies. Thanks. (MOANING) (NEW WAVE ATMOSPHERE MUSIC) (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) BUSINESSMAN: Hey! What the hell are you doing? Hey! That guy stole my wallet! (APPLAUDING) (LOUD MOANING) CONSTRUCTION WORKER: That's mine. VINNY: That's all my money. BRADFORD: Did everyone get everything? There's still some cash here. PAUL: I'll take it. Don't let him back in. (LOUD MOANING) (KNOCKING) VINNY: You almost ready? Almost. I don't know if I'm up for going out. VINNY: Oh come on. It's been weeks. When you fall off the wagon, you just have to get right back on. I don't think that's the expression. You know what I mean. (SYNTHPOP ATMOSPHERE MUSIC) There's no way I'm gonna make it up those stairs. You go ahead. No, I'm not abandoning you here. You're sweet. Really, it's okay. No, it's not okay. Let's go across the street to the Everhard. I'm not supposed to get this wet. Ooh. (LAUGHING) (SENSUAL ATMOSPHERE MUSIC) Oh yeah. (MOANING) Oh fuck. Oh fuck yeah. Don't stop. (GRUNTING) Sorry. I didn't mean to cum so quickly. I'll be good to go again in a few minutes. Smoke? Sure. How'd it happen? What? Your leg. Skiing accident. In June? Maybe that's why. Not enough snow. Can I sign it? Sure, you got a pen? You're not a cop are you? What? That's an awfully big pen. Heard about cops coming in here and marking guys engaging in lewd behavior. What? That's ridiculous. You didn't answer my question. No. I'm not a cop. Okay. Horse. That can't be your real name. Is it? It is. Well that's what most people call me. I wonder why. (CHUCKLING) No, really. My full name is Charlie Horse. My parents had a real sense of humor. Uh-huh. What's yours? My name? You do have one right? Yes. (SENSUAL ATMOSPHERE MUSIC) I'm Bradford. Hi. I brought coffee and croissants. Don't ask me where I got these. I know better. I know what I'm gonna do now. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Hi. Horse? It's Bradford. Uh-huh. We met at the Everhard Baths a few months ago. You know, the guy with the cast? Yes, I know who you are. What time is it? I don't know, it's quite late. Sorry, did I wake you? No. It's okay. What's up? Do you wanna be in a movie? What? How? You don't know anything about making a movie. I can learn. We can learn. We? What am I gonna do? (CAMERA WHIRRING) It's not working. Vinny, why don't you help him out. Hmm? Yeah. (CAMERA WHIRRING) And you can make the sets. Oh really? We could make something that is better than that dreck we saw. Well yes, anybody could do better than that. We could make something real. Something about our lives. What they're really like. Would anyone wanna see that? Yes, they would. You are crazy. So what do you say? (SIGHING) Sure. Why not? (MOANING) Are you okay? No, leave him. What? (LAUGHING) Keep going. Keep going. It's real. Silly and messy and real. (MOANING) ADAM: Did you see her hair in that new movie? Oh god yes. Everyone coming into the salon wants to get a shag now. I'm gonna die of boredom. I know. Could I get some more lasagna please, Mrs. DeMarco? Of course. But please, call me Esta. Okay, Esta. Oh, no thanks. I'm stuffed. So how about me? Would I look good in a shag? Come on down to the salon. I'll do you. (LAUGHING) Mom, stop flirting with the talent. Shut your mouth! What would dad think? Don't talk about your father. And what, you're not eating? I still have a scene to do. You remind me of my husband. God rest his soul. (GIGGLING) Still no answer. Fuck! Watch your mouth! Ow! Sorry, mom! It looks like Randy's not coming. So what are we gonna do? I'll do it. What? If that's all right with you. Yeah. Wait, who's gonna work the camera? You. I don't know how to work a camera. It's easy, I'll set it up and you just press the button. Right there. Okay. You ready? HORSE: Yeah. Press the button. (CAMERA WHIRRING) (MOANING) The film ran out. Damn it, didn't you notice? No! I told you I don't know how to use a camera. How was I supposed to know? Sorry. I know it's not your fault. We could shoot it again. No, we're out of film. Well what then? I know. We'll put it as the last scene of the movie. It'll leave them wanting more. It's like we cum so hard that we white out the screen. Okay. And then we can leave it write and have the credits in black type over it so the whole theater is bathed in this bright, white light. So everyone can see each other. Is that such a good idea? Do they wanna see who's next to them or on their knees in front of them? Yes, it's a brilliant idea. This dark damp theater, this place of shame, will be bathed in light. We will all come out of the darkness and into the light. Oh brother. If you say so. Speaking of credits, what should our names be? What do you mean? We can't use our real names. Why not? We could get arrested, or worse. Besides, Bradford Christianson and Vincenzo DeMarco are not exactly the sexiest names. He has a point there. Oh shut up. What about Brad Ford? Just your first name? No, first name Brad, last name Ford. Oooh, I get it. Like a truck. Very macho. Yeah, I like that. And it's my real name, so I'm not ashamed or hiding it or anything. What should my name be? What about your initials? VD? Yeah, that's gonna get them excited and into the theater. (LAUGHING) What about Marco? Just Marco? Just Marco. First boy I was ever in love with was named Marco. What about me? You are Horse. You will always be Horse. And you are going to be a star. But where are we gonna show it? Hello. We would like to speak to the owner please. $5 each. No, we're not here to watch a movie. We just wanna talk to the owner. Everybody pays to enter. Okay. Now can we speak to the owner? Uh-huh. Well where is he? Can you get him for us? I am the owner. BRADFORD: Oh. Uh-huh. Now what the fuck do you want? We made a film. Uh-huh. BRADFORD: And we would like to show it here. Oh really? What kind of film? It's a film about what happens with men when they are with... You know, what happens when they go to a place where they can... It's a gay porn film. First of all, we don't show porn here. We show art films. Right, and our film is an art film. And second, we don't show no fag movies here. Oh no, we know that. We've been here before. But everyone who goes here is gay. And they're all having sex with each other in the theater. So if it was an actual gay film, a gay art film, on the screen, they would be happier and you would do more business. Oh really? You think so? You know so much about running a theater. No, we don't know anything about running a theater, but we do know our film is really good and the guys here would love it. You don't get it. No one's going to come to see a gay sex film. No one that comes here is gay. Really? They may have sex with each other when they're in the theater, I don't know what goes on in there. But they're not gay when they come in and they're not got when they leave. You understand what I mean? Not really. If I show a gay movie here, then everyone that comes in will be gay. Everyone seeing them come in will know they're gay. They'll know they're gay when they leave. No one will come in. Excuse me, sir. If they were to show a gay film here, a gay art film, would you come and see it? Would you be afraid to come in, to be seen coming in? Gay art film? Real man on man action. Yeah, hardcore action. Oh my. That would be wonderful. Okay. You're in luck. This movie isn't doing any business and I need something new. I'm willing to try anything. Let me see your movie. If it's any good, I'll show it for a week. If it does better than this one, I'll keep it on longer. Fantastic. What's it called? A Night at the Everhard Baths. Let's just call it Everhard. I think that gets the point across and not scare away anyone. I don't know. I... No, shut up. Yup, that would be fun. We'll split the box office 90/10. 90 going to... Me. We were thinking more like 50/50? (LAUGHING) No. How about 60/40? There's the door. Okay, 80/20, how about that? Okay. We'll start the movie on Friday. Really? This Friday? Yeah. I thought you wanted to watch it first and decide. It can't be worse than the crap we're showing now, can it? No. Well there you go then. See you on Friday. Leave it. What are you doing? Well we paid. Might as well go in. (EASY LISTENING ATMOSPHERE MUSIC) BRADFORD: Where is everyone? Well it's 10 AM on a Friday, so everyone is at work. Which is where I should be. BRADFORD: I know, but you would think someone would show up. Isn't it time to open up? I need my coffee first. Congratulations. Thank you. Anyone come in yet? No. Well it's early. MALCOLM: What is this? A firing squad? No, it's our movie that's playing and you're our first audience member. We hope you enjoy it. Okay. Well I should get back to work. I'll see you guys later. This is anticlimactic. Let's get out of here. We'll come back after dark. And it will be packed. You promise? Yes. Come on. (RHYTHMIC BASS DRUMMING) Hey. What's this? It's our movie. You should come see it tonight. I work here. I don't need to see a movie about this place. But if you want me in your movie, let me know. I'm just here. Waiting to be discovered. (SYNTHPOP ACCOMPANIMENT) MOVIEGOER: Hey, how are you? Hey, glad you guys could come out. Can you believe it? What, you had your doubts? Well frankly, yes. I'm just kidding with you. I didn't think anyone was gonna show up either. I knew they'd come. Yes you did. Thank you. We better go in. I saved us three seats in the back. Yes, let's go in. LEXXY: 50? Shit. (APPLAUDING) My big scene is next. Okay, woohoo! All right! (APPLAUDING) Is he your boyfriend? Husband actually. Really? Yeah. You don't like to watch him perform? No. I don't mind. I'm a performer myself, so... Oh, I see. But I really wanna be a makeup artist. That's what I came to New York to be. Well we all come here to be something. Here, let me fix your lipstick. What's wrong with it? Nothing. It could just be a little softer. Softer? I don't wanna be softer. Okay, well harder then. How's that? Okay. Did you see me? Yeah. You were great. Liar. Everyone thought you were great. Thanks. Hey. I love you. I know. Fluffy! (APPLAUDING) VINNY: Is this it? Yup. Seems a little light. Yeah, well business hasn't been so great. Are you kidding? We've had packed houses every night. Not really. Really? You haven't been here for every show. Do we need to have someone in here every night counting heads? I think we do. It's true, we were screwed over with our first movie, but it played for months and we made a hell of a lot more money than we ever thought we would. And more importantly, we learned a lot. We didn't make the same mistakes again. Hey, you can't sleep here. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. 10. 11. 12. 13? Yup. (FUNKY ATMOSPHERE MUSIC) We had a total head count of 379, so you owe us... $947.50. Yeah yeah yeah yeah, I can do math. What is it? Fan mail. Read it. Dear Brad. I saw your latest movie at the Nob Hill Theater and loved it. I have been back to see it five times and will probably go back to see it tonight. I still haven't seen the ending, wink wink. I would love to be in one of your movies, preferably in a scene with Horse. I have enclosed some pictures of myself. Oh my. Let me see. If you're ever in San Francisco, give me a call. A huge fan, Mitch. Oh yeah. I could work with that. Nice. San Francisco. How the hell did he see the movie there? We only have the one print. (CHUCKLING) There's another letter. From Chicago. What the hell is going on? (FUNKY ATMOSPHERE MUSIC) What do you think you're doing? Just doing my job. I have to get this film to the lab so they can copy it. Oh yeah? Hey wait. I recognize you. You're the guy in the movie. Yes. Yes I am. Thank god some of the movies got bootlegged. Otherwise we would have nothing. They may not be the best quality. Faded, blurry, et cetera, but at least it's something. Crude as the copies are, they are all we have left. (SYNTHPOP ATMOSPHERE MUSIC) BRADFORD VO: We started making money. Good money. More than we ever dreamed of. We used the money to make more movies. More elaborate movies, with dialogue and plots. I'm sorry. I forgot my line. Cut! Sorry. Don't worry about the lines for right now. We can dub it all later like the Italians do. Oh. Just say a bunch of numbers and react. Great. Okay, thanks. Sorry. Okay, and action! One. 94. Three. Eight. Oh. Well sure, I'll try anything once. BRADFORD VO: We still didn't know what we were doing, but we felt we were on to something and the movies got better and better. And she paid me with this. You have the best clients. I know. Have you seen her hair in that dreadful new movie? Oh yeah, it's terrible. I know. Everyone coming into the salon wants to get a perm now. I know. I'm gonna die from the fumes. Bradford, do you have something we could... I got just the thing. You want some? Sure. You have done this before right? Of course. VINNY VO: Cocaine? Bradford was the worst. He made fun of me for buying my car and my furs. But at least I didn't spend all my money on coke. It all went up his nose. ESTA: Hello boys! EVERYONE: Hi, Esta! Oh no, not you too. What? Ignore him. You look delicious. Thanks. You boys hungry? I can whip something up in a jiffy. Oh no, we're not very hungry. No? Maybe later. Nobody wants to eat anything anymore. You're all gonna waste away to nothing. Mom. Okay, and action! ♪ Higher, higher, higher ♪ (SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) BRADFORD VO: I don't do drugs. Drugs just complicate things. And everything and everyone in my life is complicated enough. I don't need the hassle. ♪ Higher, higher, higher ♪ BRADFORD VO: I don't wanna talk about drugs anymore. Could you fix him up a little bit? Yeah. Sit down. Hey. You okay, Fluffy? Don't call me that. Okay, Fluffy. You still love me? Yeah. Hey. Everything's gonna be fine. I promise. You're all set. BRADFORD VO: It's so cliche. Yeah, porn stars died of drug overdoses. And that's terrible and sad. But bank tellers and housewives and lawyers and doctors died of drug overdoses too. Horse, are you ready? What are you into? Anything. Everything. Good. What about you? You'll find out. And... Action. BRADFORD VO: Porn didn't kill them. The drugs did. VINNY VO: There was a good turnout for Paul's funeral. An interesting turnout. Funerals for young gay men were a novelty then. A lot of his Johns showed up and other hustlers. And all of us of course. His family from rural Virginia had no idea what was going on. (SOMBER ATMOSPHERE MUSIC) BRADFORD VO: Paul's overdose probably saved our lives. Well most of our lives. Beth and Matt stopped doing heroin that night. Everyone stayed over at my place. Even Vinny's mom, Esta, stayed. And took care of us like we were a bunch of kids having a sleepover. We would have gone to the Everhard that night. The night of the fire. Beth and Matt stayed with me for a few weeks while they kicked heroin. It was rough, but they made it through. REPORTER: Fire broke out early this morning at the Everhard Baths on 28th Street. At least nine men are dead. Dozens injured. The seedy Manhattan bathhouse, which catered almost exclusively to homosexual men, was crowded with as many as a hundred overnight guests. VINNY VO: We didn't know the names of anyone who died. But we knew them all. Better than our own families in a lot of ways. Looking back now, that was the beginning of the end. (MOANING) BRADFORD VO: I wanted to do something different. Something more ambitious. I mean it's still porn, but I wanted to say something. No. (DRAMATIC SYNTH ATMOSPHERE MUSIC) BRADFORD VO: Every day you live as a gay man, you risk being teased, beaten up, or killed. That is what we live with every minute of every day. It's no surprise some guys can't handle it. They stay in the closet, or try to pass as straight, or even live as straight with a wife and kids. But that doesn't change who they are. Desire always wins in the end. I was raised Catholic and was always told faggots would go to Hell. The only way to Heaven was to become straight. It was drilled into my head, and that screws with you in all sorts of ways, right? So I wanted to make a movie where Heaven is all gay men. That is the Heaven I want to go to. A Heaven where there is no judgment. Just love. That's what I don't get about the Catholic Church. Why do they hate gay people so much? Why so much hate? They can have their Heaven. I'll take mine. VINNY VO: It wasn't a big hit back then when it came out. People didn't get it. They thought it was weird and dark. They get it now. Still, it did okay. And we toured the country with it. It was in San Francisco that Horse first got sick. (TECHNO ATMOSPHERE MUSIC) It's showtime. Come on, superstar. It's time to shake your money maker. I don't feel well. (COUGHING) Jesus, you're burning up. I told you I was sick. We need to get you to a hospital. No. No hospitals. Okay, well let's take a cold shower then. No. I have to do the show. BRADFORD: No, fuck the show. (WATER RUNNING) (KNOCKING) Shit. Let me handle this. (KNOCKING) Where is he? He's late. He's not feeling well. I don't care. He needs to get his ass on that stage. I have a full house. Excuse me! We have a contract. Five shows a night. If you breach that contract, you get paid nothing. And I'll sue you for the advertising we've done. Oh fuck. I'll do it. No you won't. I'll do it. What? They didn't pay to see you. Yes, but I am in the movie and I will give them their money's worth. Or do you wanna give them all refunds? Welcome to the world famous Nob Hill Cinema. We have a special guest performer tonight. The legendary porn director, and one of the stars of The Other Side of Heaven, Brad Ford. (APPLAUDING) Feel free to get as intimate with Brad as you like, but if you do whip it out and whack it off, be sure to wipe up after yourself. Enjoy the show. (TECHNO TRANCE DANCE MUSIC) (KNOCKING) Come in! It's all there. VINNY VO: We cut the tour short after San Francisco. Bradford decided we needed a vacation. So we headed to Fire Island. We were all gonna send the rest of the summer there at my place. I knew Bradford wouldn't last long. He was a dancer, remember? And us theater folk can never really relax. After a couple of weeks, the anxiety of not working, of maybe never working again, kicks in. (FUNKY ATMOSPHERE MUSIC) I have an idea for another movie. Should I start packing? No. We'll film it all out here. Call everybody, tell them to get out here right now. Okay. (LAUGHING) Hello, Matt. What brings you in today? Hey doc, I need a shot of penicillin. Why? What's going on? I'm heading out to Fire Island this weekend. Oh, I see. Well take your pants down. Does the shot have to be in my ass? Yes, why? It's my bread and butter. Don't bruise or mark it up. Don't worry. Be right back. (CAMERA WHIRRING) Come on Matt, we're ready for you. How does my ass look? It looks fine. Just fine? The world doesn't revolve around your ass. It doesn't? (LAUGHING) Seriously, are you keeping it clean? Yeah. Well I had a little something just to relax. Bad boy. How about you? Yeah. Clean and sober. Except for the whiskey. It's better than heroin. No it isn't. Seriously though. Does it look okay? No bruises or zits? No. It looks fine, perfect. Like two scoops of vanilla ice cream. Now get to work. Next victim! Hi, Horse. Hi. You gonna keep your socks on? I prefer to, if that's okay? Sure. It's not up to me. You look good. Thanks. Stand up. Turn around. What's this? I don't know. It's okay. I'll cover it up. (FUNKY ATMOSPHERE MUSIC) Hello, Matt. I think I need another shot of penicillin. Busy weekend? Oh yeah. VINNY VO: Soon after we returned to Manhattan, Horse got sick again. Really sick. There was no getting out of going to the hospital this time. Hey. How's it going? Not good. They wouldn't let me see him today. What? They're only letting family see him now. That's ridiculous. We're more family to him than those rednecks. Come on, let's go down there. I can't argue with them anymore. He hates hospitals. And now he's trapped there. I can't go back. Did you hear that Everhard is open again? What? How is that possible? I don't know, but it's true. You know, Horse and I met there. I know. I was there, remember? Let's go. (FUNKY ATMOSPHERE MUSIC) You hear about that gay cancer? I'm sick of hearing about it. Scares the hell out of me. I mean aren't you scared? I heard you get it from sex. Shut up. Just fuck me. So you're giving up sex? No. Well maybe. Sex is my life. I've given up everything else. It's all I have left. If I give up sex, I might as well be dead. So if too much sex is going to kill me, well that's that. VINNY VO: Horse remained in the hospital all through the holidays. Vinny! It was on New Year's Eve that we got the call. (PHONE RINGING) (FUNKY ATMOSPHERE MUSIC) EVERYONE: 10! Nine! Eight! Seven! Six! Five! Four! Three! Two! One! Happy New Year! Welcome to the eighties! (CHEERING) (FIREWORKS EXPLODING) (URINATING) (FLUSHING) (KNOCKING) Do you want some? Sure. What are you doing? BRADFORD: I'm editing the movie. You don't have to do that. I mean... Not right now. Yeah, I need to finish it. Okay. I'll start cleaning up. No, leave it. I'll clean up later. I just need some time alone right now. I need to finish this. I'll call you when I'm ready. When I'm done. You understand don't you? Yeah. Yeah, I understand. I love you, Vinny. I love you too. VINNY VO: I don't know if he ever finished that movie. I guess we'll never know. I'm not gonna talk about it. I'm done talking. STAGE HAND: Vinny, there's a phone call for you! Hello? (DRAMATIC SYNTHPOP ATMOSPHERE MUSIC) VINNY VO: Bradford's parents had beaten me to his apartment. They destroyed all the movies. BRADFORD: Dear Vinny. I finished the movie. I think it's our best film. I hope it is anyway. I want to go out on a high note. I hate to leave you like this, but I don't want to go through what Horse did. He was the love my life. And I never got a chance to tell him that. Tell everyone I said goodbye. I love you. Bradford. VINNY VO: I'll never forgive Bradford. Not just for killing himself, but for erasing all of us with him. I tried to make movies without Bradford. Using the latest in video technology. But it wasn't the same. My heart wasn't in it. What are you doing? I don't know. I'm gonna cum. What? I'm gonna cum. (MOANING) Did you get it? Yeah. Good, this water's freezing. (FUNKY ATMOSPHERE MUSIC) Hello? Hello? Are you open? Oh hello, Mrs. DeMarco. Yes, we're open. Esta please. Where is everyone? I had to let everyone go. Business has been deader than dead. I don't know why I bother coming in. Gives me something to do I guess. So you can squeeze me in. Yes. I do believe I can squeeze you in. Are you sure you want to get your hair cut by an AIDS faggot? I was thinking of giving my hair feathers. You know, like that girl on TV? What do you think? How about some highlights too? That would be delicious. Another funeral? Yeah. Richard. I feel like I live in a suit now. I know. Someone should just design leather suits. That way you could go right from the funerals to the bars. Not a bad idea. Vinny. There you are. I was looking for you everywhere. You were? (CHUCKLING) Well I'm here. You can always find me here. How are you? Not so good. I was wondering if you might be able to help me out here. You know, with a few bucks. What happened to the money I gave you last time? It's not the same. I'm not the same. I'm clean now. I want to go to community college and study computer science. What? I'm telling you the truth. I want to clean up my life. It's okay. I believe you. No. You don't. VINNY: Does it matter? Yes, it odes. I'm not a complete waste of space. I need you to believe that. How much money do you need? 5,000. Let me get my checkbook. VINNY VO: Matt did end up getting his degree in computer science and getting a job doing something with computers. I don't know anything about them, so I can't tell you more about it. He even paid me back with interest. He still did some porn occasionally, but more for the attention than the money. Then, on the fifth anniversary of his getting clean, he decided to celebrate by shooting up one last time. Everyone thought it was suicide. But I prefer to think it was just a stupid accident. The Everhard was shut down in April of 1986 by Mayor Ed Koch with the help of some narrow-minded, self-loathing gays. They thought they would stop the spread of AIDS. They didn't. All they did was force us all back in the closet. Lexxy's theater stayed open longer than the other porn theaters because Lexxy owned the building and lived there. But eventually, Mayor Giuliani got to her. Thank God some of the movies got bootlegged. Otherwise we would have nothing. They may not be the best quality. Blurry, faded. But crude as the copies are, they are all we have left. Did you ever think in your wildest dreams that your films would be having a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art? (CHUCKLING) No. I can't believe it. Bradford would have never believed it. I don't know why it's happening. But I am grateful. ESTA: Vincenzo, could you come here for a moment please? Sorry. My mother. Will you mother be going to the world premiere of the restoration of Everhard tonight? Of course. I wouldn't miss it for the world. (LAUGHING) Well enjoy the premiere and have a wonderful time tonight. (FUNKY ATMOSPHERE MUSIC) (HEAVY TECHNO ATMOSPHERE MUSIC) (SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
