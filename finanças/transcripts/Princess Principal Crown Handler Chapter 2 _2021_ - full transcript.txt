That's it! Right there! Lower it! Okay! In a moment the internal pressure will go critical. Mmm-hmm. Annihilation of target craft has been confirmed. The experiment is a success! The boat was sunk with only one explosion. We did it! We succeeded! With this, we can defeat the Kingdom. Intrusion, go to get movin' get goin' Intrusion, go to get movin' get goin', shadows in motion get movin', five'll get movin' get goin', light begins glowin' had it shut for a while keepin' secrets deep inside couldn't trust no one I'd stay and hide now I've got the future right in my sight We've all got some woes internalized realize the world waits for you tonight break that cage it's time, escape, revive! break open and revive! power starts to shine we rise!

Look over here! He's so handsome! What's all the fuss about? It's a parade, for His Majesty's return from abroad. Look over there. The third in line to the throne, Prince Arkham Richard. Back from five years abroad serving as governor-general in the New Continent. Richard's desire for flashy spectacle is troublesome. He worked hard over in the New Continent. Let him do as he pleases. But ... Majesty! The culprit should still be close by! Find him! Get the Prince to a safe location! Queen Majesty! I have something to report. Some time ago Prince Richard was - Did he survive? The Prince was carried to a hospital His current condition is unknown. The shooter escaped from a rooftop and we are currently searching for his whereabouts. Very well. Keep me aware of any further developments. You may leave now. Yes, my lord. I'm sorry for calling you here on short notice. You have nothing to apologize for, Uncle. How is the prince's condition? Fortunately he was only shot in the left shoulder so his life is not in danger. We should be able to visit him soon. ‫ Then the next order of business is learning the identity of the shooter. ‫ There could be an insurrectionist like before- That's enough, Edward. Not in front of the children. They ought to know what's happening. As members of the Royal Family, someday they too may face a situation like this. In fact, their parents- Edward! ‫We found the spot the shooter fired from and have suspects in custody. We'll soon know if this is the work of some organization. Was this the work of the Commonwealth? We are investigating that possibility. Further attacks could occur, and every one of us might be targeted. Please remain on your guard. It's all right. We're not open yet. I heard you can drink Rochfort single grain whiskey here. Take the box seat in the back. Is this about the unsuccessful assassination of the Kingdom's third prince? No. The Commonwealth has no connection to that. What is this? A cavorite bomb. Both the Kingdom and Commonwealth were developing them, But we were able to finish making them ready for practical use first. Four weeks ago, three finished cavorite bombs were stolen. They were brought into the Kingdom. That's as much as we know. Is the Kingdom responsible? We don't have a definitive answer. The Royal Military hasn't made any obvious moves yet either. Our concern is that it's possible that the bomb thefts and the attempted assassination were done by the same group. If a cavorite bomb is used for an assassination, the Commonwealth will be suspected. Correct. My superiors believe that these bombs could trigger a war. Who is this? Someone we suspect was involved in transporting the bombs into the Kingdom. We already have his address. But we have to be careful of trusting this information. Because it was gotten too easily? Yes. Your group's mission is to locate the bombs and their control units‫ and then recover them. You can start by searching the man's house. Understood. Searching for bombs? Yes. Could the bombs be used to attack the Royal Family? Our current mission is to stop that from happening. Johnson Carter. A show manager. His address is Chestnut Lane B52. We suspect of him of having some connection to the bomb thief. The investigation already found a lot of information. Yes, but that's why it's suspicious. Control is being very cautious with this. We already know where he lives. So doesn't that make this easier?‫ Let's go there and make him talk. Assuming he really is involved, yes. For the time being, Chise, Ange, and I will check out his house. Understood. This time Princess and Beatrice don't have anything to do. I see. Until the attempted murder incident settles down, surveillance of the Royal Family will be increased. It'd be good to refrain from actions that attract attention. That's how it is. Beatrice, we'll be leaving the Princess in your care while we're gone. Leave that to me! It's good that Prince Arkham is all right. Yes. I haven't met His Majesty before, what kind of person is Prince Arkham? He's very sociable and kind. But he went abroad when I was very young. So you didn't have many chances to meet him? I wonder how long it's been since I've seen him. He's a great man who served as governor-general of the New Continent. Wow. You were careless. I thought your time in the New Continent would have toughened you up. That's why only my right shoulder is hurt. You should praise me. Ow! You must not do that, Your Majesty. Like always, the only thing you're good at is making excuses. Grandmother is not well, so she asked me to relay a message. I'm so glad you're all right. Please take it easy and get plenty of rest. Thank you, Charlotte. I made Grandmother worry. Hello, Mary. It's been a while. You're still shy, I see. My sincere apologies, Prince Richard. If I'd set up a better security plan, this would never have happened. For Uncle to apologize to me ... I hope nothing bad happens. Watch your tongue! But Uncle is so scary (in a lot of ways). You're always like this, Onii-sama. To ensure this does not happen again, we'll speed up our search for the shooter and reinforce the guard. So Uncle owes me one. RICHARD! Your Majesty, tonight's guard will be reinforced. It may be uncomfortable, but please bear with it. Of course. It has to happen. Princess. Sorry for the wait, Beatrice. Damn it. I don't like thinking about what will happen next. Even after what happened to the Grand Chamberlain, we just get more and more bad news. Hurry and go back to your room. Mary. Why don't we go back to your room together? I'd like to talk with you a little bit more. All right. One could not say that you two have a great relationship. I certainly don't think that I'm liked by her. You haven't changed from how you were 40 years ago. Even though the Commonwealth made a new toy, it seems it was immediately stolen away by a thief. They cause us a lot of trouble. As always, you hear about these things right away. My love of gossip is well-known. That reminds me. Recently a strange bug has appeared in the Royal garden. Then we ought to find out where the bug came from. And then get rid of any others. To be worthy of trust is very precious, is it not? I'd be surprised to hear that anyone trusted you. Here you are. Olivia-san, Beatrice, have tea with us. Yes! It's good! Glad to hear it. Mary, do you dislike Uncle? He is a little hard for me to deal with. He makes me nervous. Uncle - I mean the Home Secretary is needed by this country. Thanks to the policies and decisions of the Ministry of the Interior, our country's peace is preserved Mary.‫ I'm sorry. I did not mean to speak badly of him. Did that make you tense? Mary-sama, you don't need to worry around Charlotte-sama.‫ I, as the second Princess, must refine my knowledge to the utmost It's okay. No one is going to scold you here. ‫ Just act as you normally would. Why don't we talk about fun things together? Sorry that took so long. Let's go. It seems that building has been empty these past few days. So there's no one there? Chise, you musn't let your guard down. We'll know if we go there. ‫ Are the bombs here? We don't know. Cavorite bombs are quite large in size. It's unlikely that they're here. It's unlocked. Okay. Let's search for clues. Ange, take care of the second floor. Chise and I will handle the first floor. Fine. Understood. It doesn't feel like someone was living here. No, it doesn't. Chise! I know. Ange, this place has traps! Yes. Someone set one on a door. The dust on the shelf ... There's one here too. Yes. And they probably set more sophisticated traps too. Anyway, this is a dead end. So this isn't their secret hideout? No. This place is so full of traps it must have been vacated. Or the lead was fake, designed to lure us here. The way these bomb traps were set is strange. So what do we do? For now we leave. Ange, let's search this place later. There are too many traps. Wait. I've found something. Damn it ... Ange! Chise!‫ Over here, Dorothy. Are you two all right? I'm okay. We were completely defeated. That man is something out of the ordinary. I'm so sorry. We were deceived by false information. And then ambushed. For now, let's just get out of here. The ruckus will attract attention. A letter? Yes. Tucked away in a book. That's strange. They carefully set all those traps. So it's unnatural for them to leave that clue behind. Did the man forget to take the letter and then come back to retrieve it? He certainly did seem to be after the letter. Are we the only people who are searching for the cavorite bombs? This is a head-scratcher. If we could just get the letter back, we could plan what to do next. We're fine on that point. Here are the contents of the letter. You can remember all that!? You only saw the letter for a few seconds! It's natural for spies to be able to do that. That's a handy special skill. How does one train to do that? I want to know that too. Okay, so if the letter has some kind of encoded message ... Princess, do you remember the cover of this book? I saw one exactly like it on the Grand Chamberlain's desk. That is right. And the letter was wedged in this book. Meaning it's a message from Bishop (the Grand Chamberlain)'s associate. Let's make sure. How will you do that? With the cipher key we made for decrypting Bishop's secret messages. If we break the code ... It's complete. Let's have a look. Andy & David Company. Fairy Queen and ‫Firey Mountain Dragon Large Boxes (3), Medium Boxes (3)‫ Third Thursday at 6 o'clock in the morning. Port of Thames. 8th Wharf. But what does it all mean? Hmm. This one is a company for performing arts. That's it. Openly carrying cavorite bombs would attract attention. So they're carrying them around inside of boxes for big stage props. Which means ... We check out the theater for their musical program in London! It's another mechanical animal! That one is a dinosaur, an ancient creature. An honorable ancestor of the Black Lizards. Don't believe that, Chise-san. Princess! We glady welcome you to our theatre. Even though we suddenly requested it, you were able to prepare seats for us. Thank you very much. Whatever do you mean? This is but a trifle. This way, please. That's Princess for you. She can exert extreme pressure. Of course. She's a famous princess even on the Black Lizard Planet. I was talking about this country. Coincidentally, I was too. Accursed steam dragon! Manager, is that beast also a dinosaur? No. That would be a dragon. A dragon ... Ah, so the samurai of this country once fought them? Why not have a meal with me? I'll treat you! Stop that foolishness. Why do you try to hit on women when you're always in debt? Blind love is never simple. This is inconvenient. We have to get past them to go to the warehouse. Move it. It's time for me to make my appearance. Mary! It's a pity. Dorothy, let's go. Righty-o. How long can we use this? As long as you want. No one will pay any attention to you. It used to be a big storehouse for odds and ends. Is that right? In that case, fine. This won't take long. That man! Yes. The one from the photograph. Jackpot. It'd be nice if all the bombs were here. Boxes. Three large, three medium. Let's check their contents later. Boss man! (lit: master of house) Sorry, were you in a meeting? Billy! Why are you here? I was hoping to get paid in advance ... Cut that out! You'll get paid after the stuff has been transported! You'll - Okay, fine. You're Billy-kun, right? It's all right. I'll hear you out. Yes, this is how it should be. According to a report from D, the bombs and their control units have been located. We have confirmation for all three bombs. They've also confirmed that the target of the investigation is there. Vegas Steam Theater. Our enemy was smart to hide them away in that place. If you know where they are, hurry and retrieve them! If they analyze the control units, the Commonwealth will lose our tactical advantage! The bombs are big and heavy. It's too difficult to try to retrieve them from the Kingdom. We should destroy them. Our superiors ordered us to retrieve them, not destroy them. We know what orders were given to us by the military. Examine the schedule of the theater so we can arrange for a retrieval team. Yes sir. Dorothy-san, how long are we going to continue the surveillance? Performances by the company will end in a week, and then they'll prepare to do something else. That's when we meet other teams to carry out the bomb recovery plan. Will that be okay? Even though we'll be making a disturbance, it seems the higher-ups still want the bombs returned. Dorothy-san, you and the rest of the team won't be going, right? That is- Who're you? We're from Vitud Insurance. My husband is not in right now. May we wait inside for him? Time for a shift change. Ah. Yes. Your Majesty, we have thirty minutes until we move on to the next task. I'm aware. Next up is a speech to the church and then presentation of a medal. Then dinner with the King of Zanzibar. After Richard was shot, unrest and uncertainty grew. Though now is not the time to be complaining. Why not have Mary to give the speech at the church? No. In three days I want her to attend a ceremony on our personal yacht. So I'll be handling the speech at the church as planned. This is nothing compared to Uncle's strict lessons on how to be a king. You are a particularly patient man, Edward. Be ready in thirty minutes. I will. I feel sorry. You're here looking after me even though you you're in worse shape. This isn't so bad. The only part that hurts is my shoulder. Grandmother, I want you to take care of yourself rather than worry about me. I've been feeling very fine recently. Might be because I can see your face. I'm glad to hear that. It was good for me to return home. I didn't want you to go to the New Continent. Uncle decided that. It was unavoidable. I had Charlotte attend the banquet. I feel bad about always burdening her with troublesome duties. Things are bad. She understands. Uncle said that the attack on my life is not the end of the threat. We don't know who is responsible. Someone else could become a target. William's in charge of that. You don't have to worry about it. I have soldiers that helped me stabilize the New Continent. And should someone try to cause harm to my country or my family, I'll use those soldiers with no hesitation. I felt nervous. Indeed. Charlotte-sama. What about Mary? Well ... She's become more withdrawn since Richard-sama was attacked. She been assigned more official business to do on her own. And I can't be with her. You want to attend the ceremony on the yacht with Mary? I do. My schedule is open on that day and I want to participate in the ceremony. Is that all right? Yes. Very well. I'm assigning more guards to the ceremony in response. I'll also explain the flow of events to take place at the ceremony. Over here, please. Very well. So since you have nothing to do, you're going to attend the ceremony? I'm sorry. I said I'd do it without talking with you first. It's fine. We can be there and serve as guards. Thank you, Ange. I can't leave Mary alone. She lost her family. And then had to carry out her duties to the Royal family alone. It's like how it was for you. It's a hard world for a small child. If I'd had a big sister like you, maybe I could have endured life inside the palace. I'm not the big sister you're thinking of. It's those guys again. Time to change shifts. Reports from the surveillance team have stopped. It is possible their position was attacked. That's why I said we should retrieve them immediately! What do you intend to do now? Contact the bomb retrieval team and put together a strategy to get the bombs back. We don't know what we're going up against. The more time we lose, the harder it'll be to find the bombs. And if a cavorite bomb is detonated inside the Kingdom, it'll mean war. We must prevent that, not stand in ashes. As soon as the strategy is ready, immediately set it into action. Our top priority is recovery of those bombs. Chise, we're having a meeting. The surveillance team was wiped out? Yup. How could that have happened? Control is looking into it. Okay, how will we retrieve the bombs? Another team will use a diversionary tactic. That's when we go in to confirm the bombs are there. If the bombs are there, we get them out. A very overbearing way of battle. It's how things are. The Commonwealth is extremely worried about their appearance. It has begun. Hey, Billy. You seem to be in high spirits, don't you? And you bought an expensive bunch of flowers. No more excuses, you'll pay us back today- You're not getting away! That hurts! That's the man! Capture him! What the heck is thiiisss!? They're shooting a lot! One of the boxes is missing. They've taken one out of here. Boss! There are people with guns at the back door! What!? Where is the boss? He promised to give me some money ... There was a ruckus at the entrance so he went over there! Hey, wait a minute. Who's going to give you the money? Uh... What is happening? It's ... Could be the Commonwealth. Maybe. But I don't care either way. We can't wait for orders from His Majesty any longer. Move the remaining bombs immediately. Yes sir. Boss! Men with guns are advancing into here! What? There's a huge ruckus happening downstairs. What do we do? We leave. We're not dying for the bombs. Get your men and get out of here. Yes. Uh ... That doesn't seem to be working. Do we try again later? Don't be ridiculous! We'll get the money right now! We came here to get it! Please, just a moment! You're leaving, right? Can you give me the money before you do? I delivered the goods. You'll be paid once the operation is successful. Oh no. Let's go. You're the one named Johnson Carter. You don't look like a theatre manager. One of the bombs is missing. Where'd you send it? Oh, is that it? You're the ones who came to my hideout. Which do you work for? Kingdom or Commonwealth? Wait up. You moron! Where's the money? My boss was nabbed by a woman with a gun! I can't get the money! We'll hand him over to the retrieval team. Then it's up to our superiors. Oh, I'm going to your boss, eh? It'd be nice if they're reasonable people. You don't seem very worried. What the heck!? Wait! Dang it! Don't move a muscle! I won't miss you with the next one. What is that? What's going on? Hey, - He's trying to get outside. I know. Get out of my way! That's the team who came in from the back door. We'll leave the rest to them. We're leaving. You go first. Understood. How was that? Did I get 'em? You fool! Your boss owes you enough. Let's just get out of here. I'm not going to bother tailing you home. There are a lot of things I want to ask you. Boss! This has nothing to do with me! Where did you take the bomb? Well, you know I- Earlier, you said you delivered the goods. I'll let you leave if you tell me where it is. Stop wasting time! Answer her! The port! I delivered the goods there! Which one? The port of London! It was for some kind of ceremony! The ceremony on the yacht. Yeah. Come on. W-what's gonna happen to us? I wish we'd known sooner. They're going to kill Mary. They were waiting until the ceremony to use the bomb. What do you mean? A cavorite bomb releases tremendous destructive force. They'll detonate the bomb on the ship while it's at sea. All the passengers will drown. That's foul play. 300 VIPs from various countries were invited. This is the worst timing for us. Meaning? Both Princess and Beatrice are onboard. The ship is moving at a speed of 16 knots (18.4 mph). It'll have moved out onto the open sea in an hour. Dorothy, step on it! Got it. Is Mary doing a good job? She should be in the vicinity of Tilbury about now. Are you worried, sir? Her public duties are going to increase. She has to carry them out well. This time Charlotte-sama is with her. They're probably fine. Charlotte? Hmm. She's too soft on Mary. That's the boat. I can't catch up to it. In a moment they'll be out of range. I'll jump from here. C'mon, Chise. We're going. Ready anytime. Where do we look for it? Cavorite bombs use steam. It is probably near the boiler. That's it. It looks like the ceremony went well. Yes. Nee-sama. Hello again, Mary. Thank you for coming with me today. I feel uneasy when I'm all alone. Don't worry. I had doubts and worries when I was your age. You did? Princess ... I'm sorry. I need to step away for a moment. Beatrice. Yes. A bomb on the- Someone put a bomb on the ship!? It was placed above the boiler room. The timer is already active. Oh no! Once the ship is farther out at sea, the bomb will detonate after twenty minutes. We'll be evacuating both of you with the C-Ball first. No, Ange. I'll stay here. There's no time. You have to get out of here. The bomb is connected to the steam engine. Even if we stop the timer, the bomb could still detonate. Okay. We'll evacuate and deal with the bomb at the same time. What are you going to do? I'll talk to the captain and tell him to evacuate everyone. How? What will you tell him? We can't tell them there's a bomb on board. We'll leave that to Chise-san. Sorry to have kept you waiting, Mary. The ship is huge so I got a little lost. So that happens to you too? Was that a little too much? Why is there so much smoke? Is there a fire? Will the ship sink? Everyone, you don't have to worry. We are looking into the matter. Please remain calm. We're getting Mary-sama and Charlotte-sama off this boat. Make the preparations. What was that!? We have royal family members on board! What if the worst comes to pass? Um... Princess. We have a craft ready to go. Please evacuate first with Princess Mary. No, evacuate Mary and the other passengers first. I'll see them off before I leave. What was that? What was that noise? Did the ship crash into something? This is no joke. What's the situation? Ange! What is happening!? Is there a fire? You've gotta be kidding me! Shouldn't we make a run for it? Ange! It's not working. The pressure won't decrease. Is there another way? What are you trying to do? Tie this to the bomb. Bring out all the hoses. Keep working. We'll check it out. What the heck is that? Is the pipe leaking? We have to stop the boiler. Throw the hose on the gear! Pull the bomb out! A bomb? Hey you! Move out of the way! The bomb will come flying out! We've completed evacuating the ship. Princess, please hurry and evacuate. Yes. We were able to successfully recover all the stolen bombs. What part of this is a success? The thing's in pieces! Yes, but we were able to get out of this without the tech being stolen. Good work. Tell all the teams they did well. I wondered what was going to happen. It's good that nothing serious occurred. Yes. If you feel nervous or uncertain about things, please let me know. I'll support you without fail. Okay. Yes. Charlotte-sama! Olivia. Did something happen? Well... Someone from the police came. Prince Edward was attacked and killed by an unknown assailant. The killer struck while His Highness was alone. When the doctor examined him, it was already too late. Nee-sama? Excuse me. Go back with Olivia. Beatrice, go with them. Y-yes. Olivia, I'm counting on you to do the rest. I understand. Hasn't there been some mistake? I'm sorry. It happened. Oh no... Richard onii-sama. Ooops. This won't do. I didn't prepare for this. So if you're here, Mary's still alive and kicking. Not everything goes according to plan. What are you talking about? I panicked a little when I found you were going with Mary. I have a high estimation of you. I'm glad we didn't have to part ways. Nii-sama... Can you feel the wind in the air? The wind of change for our Kingdom. But there is a wall in the way. A traditional, old-fashioned wall designed to perpetuate the Kingdom. I'm a wind of change, here to reform the Kingdom. Charlotte. Which side are you on?
