We'd rather settle it between ourselves It's so beautiful seeing you together But now we're just friends. After all you’ve lived. Edvaldo is too thick-headed. There’s no reasoning with him I did the best I could. I never imagined you’d go through with this divorce Please, I'm in a hurry. Got work to do. Can we get over with our business here? I've worked here for such a long time, I... I love what I do. You'll keep doing what you do, but in a different environment. Sir...

No, Joana, you'll work now with property, it's different. - Adverse possession, selling— - I'll punished... for trying to make bureaucracy more humane? - Is that it? - There’s no humane bureaucracy.

Government of Brazil, the greatest work is caring for life. Father, oh father My King, Lord of the heavens How could I thank you enough? How many times did I doubt? How many times I thought it wouldn’t happen? And you covered me in your celestial mantle, Lord. Oh Father. You’ve guided me to the way of the light, my Lord. I don’t even know how could I thank you enough. I thank you, I thank you at every moment for being allowed By your divine goodness, my Lord That my body could be an instrument for your wisdom Thank You for the message You’ve sent me I thought it would never come. Joana didn’t have to thank. Everything God gives is by His grace Uncertainty isn’t defeated by promises of faith. Faith is every certainty that needs no proof I think I have a miracle inside my womb What? I think I'm pregnant. How come? How do you know that? At the store, Are you really sure?

Pastor! Are you asleep? I wanted to talk so bad Wake up, please. What is it? You got a strong scent of flowers there Do I smell? How about you take a shower and then we talk? I had to make a crown of jasmines I won’t be able to sleep with that smell Don't be dramatic. It's not like I smell of cigarettes or alcohol Grace and light, sister Amen, pastor I came yesterday, but there wasn't anybody here Yeah, I did everything I could, but God didn't let me come. I was in so much need. What happened? I’m pregnant Praised be God, sister! Such good news! Praised be, congratulations! But there's something really strange about all of this, pastor. What could be strange about that, sister? I don’t know who’s the father That is not good. Not good at all. And your husband? He’s not the father of my son. Would you like to ask for forgiveness? There’s something left unexplained, pastor But there must be an explanation. What are you going to tell your son? Sister, there’s not much I can do. Right here, I can only facilitate your repentance. There must be some message from God in all of this that I’m not understanding. I need help, Pastor. Is your body is pure? I give my body to God. Do you want to listen to some hymn to help with your repentance? There's nothing to regret. Sister, God’s listening. If you didn’t sin and yet your son has no father, then what are you trying to say? I think God touched me. The only sin that can't be forgiven is blasphemy Be careful with what you say. Really careful. And what if it’s true? What if God really touched my body? As per protocol, I'll have to report your case to the help center. You’ll have to talk to them? It’s not a simple case. Will I have to go there? If I go they’ll say I’m lying. If I lie, they’ll say I’m sinning. Every child is God’s child, but be careful with what you say. I don't know if... If they’re prepared to hear what you have to say. Strengthen me with raisins, refresh me with apples, for I am faint with love. His left arm is under my head, and his right arm embraces me. Master, Excuse me, May I read the the passage I brought specially for today? You may, brother. But it's from another book, is that okay? Samuel, Chapter 1 Verse 11. if you will indeed look on the affliction of your servant and remember me and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a son, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life Me and Joana are gonna be father and mother. Glory. - Congratulations! - Thank you. Thank you very much. Glory. Hallelujah. - Congratulations, sister. - Hallelujah, sister. Amen. Thank you. Glory. Thank you. Congratulations, sister. I wish you happiness. What’s up with you, huh? I didn’t like how you told everyone that I’m pregnant. What’s the difference? The detector is gonna show that anyway and everybody will know just the same And what’s the problem with sharing it with our group? After everything we've went through, to have this child. Aren’t you happy? Of course I am. I just wished you’d ask me before telling. What’s going on? What happened? This child is not ours. Not ours? I don’t know how to explain, Danilo. If it’s not ours, whose child is it then? I don’t know. Aren’t you the mother? I am. If you’re the mother then I’m the father. No. Who’s the father? - Someone from Divine Love? - No. I did the paternity test, It’s not you nor any of them. Danilo - Danilo. - Who's the father? - There’s no father - If there’s no father then what is it? Nobody needs to know We can keep it among ourselves - Only you and me will know - Look here, This is YOUR child. Brought them all for you. Shouldn't they be having their mother's milk? No, they're fine. They drink regular milk now. - Won’t you keep any with you? - I can't Because of the pedigree thing. - Want to come in? - No, thanks. I’m on my way. Bye. Judging must be left to the judges. The notary mustn't judge anyone You can refer this to the tribunal and they’ll handle the process Joana, your husband has just filled for a divorce He's right there. Danilo, stop that. Listen to me, why are you doing this? Why do you want to destroy our family? This child right here is a miracle. Our marriage is a lie. Don’t talk like this, God’s listening. If he’s listening, tell him it’s over. It’s over. You don’t love me anymore? This has nothing to do with love. It does. because those who love, believe. And those who believe, have faith, Danilo. Faith? What faith? Look at what happened. - Faith? - Have you lost your faith? Your faith won’t fool me anymore. You get it? You don’t believe in my faith anymore? Go away, then. Get out. - Good evening, brother. - Good evening, sister. Where's Danilo? Danilo couldn’t come, I’m just here to talk to Master Dalva really quick. You know the rules, ma’am. it’s only for today. Please, sister, you know I can’t do that. Please. Not by yourself. I'm really sorry, if I could... But I can't. Pastor, you gotta help me. I can’t be treated like this, I’m not some loose woman. You didn’t go to the help center, sister. But didn’t you say yourself that they wouldn’t believe me? I’m not authorized to handle your case. I love God. I’m a completely dedicated to our Lord Jesus Christ. Is that my sin? Loving too much? - Are you doubting me, pastor? - Who I am to doubt or to judge anyone? What do I have to do to prove that I love God? Listen to God from the inside of your heart Help me, pastor, please. Go in peace, sister. I’m gonna prove that I’m telling the truth Those who love, do not betray Those who love, share Joana said she did everything out of love And would do it all again. More than two thousand years of waiting. Everyone was waiting for the return of the messiah. But nobody was prepared to receive him. the white mantle of light Covered her face It was a woman My mother I was her nameless offspring The great happening The secret pride The divine love I’m not registered I don't have a name No documents Those who are born without a name, can grow without fear
