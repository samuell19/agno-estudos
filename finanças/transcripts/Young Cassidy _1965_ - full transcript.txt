THE REBEL DREAMER Cassidy! For the love of God, your enthusiasm is going to cost us all our lives! Pour the soil carefully and where you must! Yes sir. What do you think you're doing down there rebuild Ireland by yourself? Come on, get out of there, get in! Cassidy, you've only been with us one day... And you've been about to cause us all a terrible problem. - I'll control myself, if they give me a chance. - Go there and help out with the lamps. And try to control your impulses, boy. Hi. They told me to give you a hand. Good, good. We can't let the fancy ladies fall into that ditch you're digging tonight, when they return from the Castle, don't you think? - Have you never used a shovel? - Of course I used a shovel! - But not that kind. - Ah, you're a bloody liar. And it will kill you, if you keep using it like this. Hey, you put the shovel in, then gently tilt it... and you cast the earth with a gentle swing of your arms. Do not worry, I'll do. - I'm sure of it. - Many thanks. You're welcome. My name is Mullen, Mick Mullen. Johnny Cassidy. You are certainly a weird guy. Because what you say? None of those who work here are used to reading books. Oh, it's "Land Reform" by Michael Davitt. Tell me boy Are you interested in things on earth? Hell, we all should be! We work pretty close to her, don't we? Do you want to win the battle with a shovel? No, but I earn my bread with her. You'll go far, Johnny. - Take the lamps to the ditch. - Yes sir. You're a nice guy. Hello Grandma! Did you find something, Ella? Nothing at all. We will have to keep waiting. Come on, have some tea. I have washed the children's clothes, they are already dry. - Get that out of there, Sara. - You better pick it up. That must be Johnny. I keep my job, mother! - And how are you doing in that job? - It's not about picking roses, But I'll try hard and I'll do it no matter how hard it is. My God, don't let it be too hard for you. Wait and see, Cassidy will be the best trench digger in Ireland in a month. - Have you found a job, Ella? - No. And haven't they told you of any? Don't worry honey, you'll be luckier tomorrow. I notice a soft fragrance... - Is it meat, mother? - I thought that a little... of something special in the pot, it would make up for a hard day's work. Don't go too far, mother, the soul never depends on the flesh. Although he would escape the body without her. I'm going to put the children to bed. - I'll bring you something to eat later. - Later, what are you going to upload? - Nothing of yours! - Oh, Ella, don't be silly. This stew is very rich, I put a couple of slices of smoked ham, a carrot and an onion. You will like. "Already the winter of our discontent is summer radiant with this York sun, and the clouds that threatened our home lie in the deep bosom of the earth." "From the ocean". Oh, "from the ocean". I will represent the bastard king... to the lucky people of County Kerry for two weeks. Oh what is this Too good for any king of England past or present. Exaggerated! - Are they going to pay you this time? - Pay me? For an artist that means absolutely nothing. It means for your family, look around you. I'll send what I can. Archie is a good boy, he always sends something. We are both good boys, mother, And look how we live, it doesn't matter that we're good boys She, I've been thinking... that you should ask for help from the needy. You mustn't think about that, Johnny. - We are too poor to be proud. - Don't go on, I don't want to. She is going through a difficult time, but we have no right to ask him to humiliate himself like this. Is it humiliating for a person to ask for the right to help? I don't want to hear about it anymore. Keep eating. - I don't want to do it, Johnny! - I have to go, I have rehearsal. - I won't be back until dawn. - Yes, you go play king... and don't worry about the injustices here. - You're terribly sincere, Johnny. - I've been told many times. - You show your feelings to the world. - And what's wrong with that? Nothing, for those who love you. Whether you like me or not, I'm going to tell the truth. And to write it, too. I wish the queen would remember me in time And take me in his regiment with all my youth and vigor But I'm afraid I can never... - Hi, Mick. - Johnny! The moment has come! - Tomorrow everyone will be on the street! - Take it easy. Come on in. This morning when I saw you, I discovered that... I introduce you to my mother. - Nice to meet you, lady. - Mr. Mullen. Nice to meet you, Mr. Mullen. Please take a seat. Thank you. You can speak in front of my mother. Johnny, seeing you this morning I discovered that you were one of us. The kind of man we can trust. That is why I have come to speak to you. Good. Come on, Mick, don't beat around the bush! Well, you see, the day after tomorrow everyone in the transport will be on strike, not a single car will move, not a single wheel will roll. When the 8 o'clock clock, all the trams will stop, every wagon, tram or car will stop where it is at that moment. This is great news, huh? OMG! Are we going to have those horrible encounters against each other again? It is bad news that you bring us. And don't presume to go on strike! Wait to get out of one of them... and then you will see what you feel! I go upstairs with the children. Do not fear mother. Will there be a splinter among us? - We have to be united. - We are forging that union. Are you with us? Of course I am with you. I'll tell you what your job will be. We want the case of the workers to be stated with hard and concrete words. We have a machine that will print it tomorrow, loose sheets that we can distribute to the people. We need good words, Johnny, to reach the heart. Will you want to write them? - I'll try, Mick. - Up with the revolution! Workers unite! You have nothing to lose, just your jobs. Do you want to go your way and not get mixed up in this? I will tell you something. There was a boy named William Shakespeare, that he could reach the hearts of people by gathering them in a theater, better than you will be addressing a riotous mass. What do you mean by that? Don't forget the dreamer in you, Johnny. Goodnight. Johnny. What, Mick? Will you write it? Yes, I will do it. I will write that. UNITED WE WILL WIN DIVIDED WE WILL FALL Wow, the police won't be strolling around today, huh? Look, that's where the conflict comes from. Damn you, scab! I'm afraid something horrible is going to happen here. Turn around, the horsemen are coming! Turn around! Hold on tight to me, let's get out of this! - We'll be free, you bastards! - They're going to cut his neck! Come! Let's go in here, we need a drink to revive ourselves. Agree. It's a mess. I'm ashamed to be seen with you. Would you like to pour us a couple of hot whiskeys? Thank you. - Does your leg hurt? - Not much. - What is your name? - Daisy Battles His name is very reassuring. My name is Johnny Cassidy. Nice to meet you, Johnny Cassidy. I finally find you, Johnny, thank God you're okay. Well, today we stood up to them, huh? Our dream is coming true. Fighting for the freedom of old Ireland, huh? Am I in the way? I think this is both a particular and a political reason for dispersing. Johnny, be careful, you're putting your soul in danger. Keep our cause close to your heart. Here it is. You better come in, I'll fix your leg. We will be alone, you don't have to worry. Do you recognize it? Sure, it's you. From the way he looks you would say he has never seen me. Not like this, of course. It was at an Easter function. I was very successful. Tell me, does the show give enough money to have this house? I haven't gotten it with that, I have an uncle. Have a what? On one occasion I tried to work. Picking fruit to make compote. Sixty hours a week at half a penny. It was not for me. - You want me to see your leg? - Screw my leg! - I'd rather see yours. - Shall I sew your pants then? Or also to hell the pants? That's... My skirt and petticoat have wrinkled from people's hands. - Do you want to finish crumpling them? - Yes with a little luck. I am seeing that you are a terrible man. - Any sensible woman would run. - Why do not you do it? That is precisely what I am going to do. But don't run away. You are a terribly passionate boy. You are a good man. Thanks, Daisy. Oh well, it's all for old Ireland, anyway. I guess you want to go now. - I have to go. - Kiss me again. Close the door softly, honey. I'll try to get some sleep. - Hi Johnny. - Hello mother. Hi Uncle. - What is that? - A nonsense that I bought for Sara. What is it? I saw your father today. - Ella's husband? - Yes, while I was on the hill, look for the asylum. She had a very sweet voice as a child. She? She taught me to sing and also to read. I remember her when she sat where you are now reciting "The Lady of the Lake" and other nice things. Mother, you speak of her as if she had died. Ella, Ella... Jesus have mercy on us. Oh, Johnny, what happened to my beautiful daughter? I don't know, mother. She does not know it herself. He wanted to get away from all this and married the first flashy uniform that was presented to him. Yes, it was. And he looked like a good man, and very elegant in that nice uniform. But what happened to Ella, Johnny? Five children in the same number of years, they don't leave much time for music and poetry. So I have lost it. It has been stolen from us by misery. Hi, Ella. Today I saw the Drum, he seemed happy. I think he recognized me. Johnny bought it for Sara. Oh how we danced in those days! He was a very good man, my drummer. And the children liked to go for a picnic with him. He taught you to box. Bring the kids in the house, Johnny, do me a favor. I'll put them to bed early. Will there be oil for tonight? - Not enough. - I plan to write, I will need light. - Where is the can? - In the backyard. There are too many good things in this country that go to waste! The milkman! The milkman! That will cost you six pence. - I only have two pence. - Is not sufficient. You should be ashamed of stealing books. Thank you I did not call the police. Thank Mrs. Wait! Did you also take this one? Yes ma'am. - Do you have any more? - No, no, that's it. - But what do you want them for? - To read. "Gulliver's Travels", "The Works of Oliver Goldsmith". - What was the other one? - Oh, I wanted that one for fun. "Julius Caesar". - What is your name? - My name is Nora. Why do you ask? - My name is Johnny Cassidy. - Okay, Mr. Cassidy, you will be welcome here when you can pay for the books you take. Yes ma'am. I better go and make my way through life alone. Goodbye. - Are you Johnny Cassidy? - Yes, I am. This is for you. Hey, wait, what is it? What is that, Johnny? Some books I tried to steal yesterday. Oh come on, don't joke. I'm not kidding, mother. What a great girl. You will not find the secret of happiness in the pages of any book. Leave me alone. Here's another who will tell you too. - ¡Johnny! - ¡Tom! - Boy! - Mother! That representative of British imperialism, your son, is at home! ¡Tom! How glad I am to see you! - You look good. - You have a week's leave. - God help us. - What's that, Tom? The stripes of good conduct, mother. - I'll fix you something for dinner. - No thanks, not tonight, eh guys? No, mother, not tonight. I'm not hungry, mother, but I'm terribly thirsty. - Here, some money for the house. - Oh, Tom. With the rest of the pay I am going to invite my brothers to drink. Where is my new cap? Hey guys, get in line! Good! - Hey, let go! - Don't go in the middle of the road! Let's go outside! - Those go to the same place as us. - Insurance. - I want more beer! - Does not suit you. I want another! - Three beers! - And then! Good! - To your health, Johnny. - To yours. For all three. Ah, red and green! As you said? I said red and green, the colors of old Ireland. For the day when there isn't a single British uniform left in all of Ireland. Good toast! It makes me laugh to see guys behind a ball instead of working like men. When you see certain guys, you wonder if the uniform misses the man, or if it is the man who misses the uniform. Very good, Billy! As a member of Her Majesty's army, you'd better get out of here, soldier. As I am enjoying a leave, I plan to drink the beer that I have paid for. As soon as they entered here, they started to provoke these guys. - What does it say! - No one has provoked anyone. Everything has been discussed in peace and quiet. Everything was going fine until these uniformed bastards... Don't talk like that to the authority in my house! Hey, no swearing, boy! Have your beers and get out of here like good guys. Hey, let the boys drink in peace. It is very dangerous... disobey the orders of a member of the Irish Royal Guard... when on duty. To hell with the Irish Royal Guard. Will you please release my poor little brother? - How do you say? - My poor little brother, let him go, if not, God will never forgive him. Thank you, sir, so you won't have to regret it. Look up there. Let's go. Come on, guys, upstairs! Are we all here? On going! - What is that? - Take a look. - Have you gone crazy, John? - Maybe. Read here. Wow, this is good, Johnny, this is good! Wait, I'll read it to you. "Sound the trumpet loud" By John Cassidy. Wait, I'll read it to you in another. Because it's in everyone, you know? "People of Ireland, what are you thinking? Sound the trumpet, roll the drum and be happy." - How much have you been paid for this? - Two shillings and six pence. And did you buy six copies at a penny each? And I still have benefit. Wait, I'll read you another. It's in everyone, you know? Yes, I know, Johnny. "Oh, you foolish Irish people, why do you cry out and make unseemly noises? For God's sake, shut up and don't make your best friends' ears... they torment themselves with your foolish and discordant screams." Oh, nice words, Johnny, really nice. This is the first John Cassidy published. - Michael, be still! - Come on, kids, don't fight! Now wash your hands and then I want to see them. Michael, be still for once! She, see if you can make your children shut up! - I don't want to hear you anymore! - Be patient, they will leave after breakfast. I won't bother you for long. - How is that? - You have a job. - What kind of job? - To scrub, what else? - And how much do they pay you? - Ten shillings for the whole week. They found a room near work. I hope you will help her with the transfer. Ten fucking shillings! It's better than nothing. Good Morning. Don't worry, I'm not stealing today. Army funds. Do you have a military instruction book? I mean like the one soldiers wear. Even if it's from the English army. Yes, it will be in the military books section. Do you want to come over here, Mr. Cassidy? Here. Thanks for the book you sent me. - You don't have to thank me. - I plan to pay it. Okay, when I can. Would you leave me alone after the other day? - Today he has money in his pocket. - But stay anyway. Let's see what's here. "The Duke of Wellington's dispatches ." "Forty years in the Punjab." "Cavalry Tactics in Sedan." "Manual of military instruction. 1864." This will go well, it will give the boys work. You seem to be a very diverse man, Mr. Cassidy. Yes, I like to keep up to date on things. Good. One shilling. - Many thanks. - To you. And if you intend to do what I think with that book, be careful. I will have it. I'll have it. Come on, duck now! More crouched! Want to get your head shot off? Down, you are advancing, not retreating! All right, rest up! - How's that going, Cassidy? - Well, they're catching your breath, sir. - Have you done any formal exercises, Sergeant? - Not yet, sir. You have to make them learn to walk in an elegant and martial way. - Keep this in mind, sergeant. - Wouldn't it be less to win the war... and throw out the English, before learning to pace? I am not in command of a troop of gypsies, Cassidy, but of soldiers. Yes sir. Hey, Johnny, what is that? This is a book that teaches how to move one damn foot after the other. Ah, it's a great book, Johnny, what we needed! - You can keep it. - Thank you! - Let's get to work. - Hey guys, attention! Attention! Weapons on your shoulder! Right! Head on! One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two ...! The world is a theater, Mick, but some of us have rehearsed very little. Have you made Ella's transfer? Yes, mother. Is it properly installed? Pretty good, you only have a handful of things, it will not be difficult for you to place them. Do you have enough oil for your work? It will need to last six hours or more. How have you left it? I already told you fine, don't worry, mother. - Did it have fire? - I brought you half a bucket of coal. You have done very well. - Good night, Johnny. - Goodnight mother. Mom is dead. - What are you saying? - He died in his bed, without telling us anything. I called her, but she didn't answer me. So, the creature approached her, lit a candle... and when he looked at his mother she was dead. It lay on an old sack of flour, dead. Cursed forever be poverty. Amen. But we will fight it. And in the meantime, let's appreciate the little things. The beauty of this hawthorn. She loved this tree. He said that beauty is more important than bread. How do I explain that to your children? We must have uniforms. No man who respects himself can fight for his country in everyday pants. I agree. The volunteers of 1782 wore a beautiful uniform. Green pants, yellow jacket and a red helmet with a white feather. Wouldn't that be beautiful to us? Listen guys, we are revolutionaries, not pantomime soldiers. We are not going to fight to wear elegant uniforms, we have to act like guerrillas. We all know why we fight as well as you do. We will fight better in uniforms than with worn jackets and ripped pants. The uniforms will give us a sense of union, they will promote discipline. In addition, the English will thus regard us as soldiers who wage war... - and they will treat us accordingly. - The English will look at us... like damn rebels we take what we wear. - We agree with the captain. - Yes. - Don't insist, Johnny. - One moment, uniforms won't do us any good against machine guns! We must make up for the lack of means with talent and cunning, take what one has, dodge and hit! - We want uniforms! - I'm the boss here! We have already talked enough! And I say that the issue of uniforms is settled forever! I have guaranteed payment to a company for 50 modern style uniforms, to one pound each. What is that? The flag, sir. Now we have a flag. The plow and the stars. Who? What's wrong with you, mother? You were backlit, Johnny... - and I couldn't see you. - Are you okay? Oh yeah, well, well. Where have you been, Johnny? In the countryside. - With the rebels? - That's. What can you get out of that, Johnny, out of that military drill? The freedom of Ireland, if used properly. No man or people can be liberated by such means. It is contrary to the law of men and contrary to the law of God. I don't want you to forget it, Johnny. And what happens if the law of men is unjust, what is done then? Suffer it. I have told them that uniforms are only good for parading, that the English will use cannons in the streets of Dublin, if necessary. I have also told them to stop gathering around in large groups. I've told you all that, but you take me for crazy. So I have decided to leave them. Thank God! You are daring, Mr. Mullen! And in broad daylight! Excuse me Miss, but I've lost my mind. We both fight for freedom, but not to that point. - Johnny! - Ah, damn! Nice to see you, Daisy. - What is the state of your soul, Mick? - Oh well, well, no blemish! - Ah, I'm very glad. - Thank you. You see, I was walking around here... And I ran into Miss Battles and we got talking about this and that. - Are you sure? - Yes! I've missed you so much, Johnny Cassidy. "I've missed you so much, Johnny Cassidy." - Do you want to walk a little with us? - Oh, it will monopolize the conversation... - and it will dazzle you. - I can free your soul from falling into sin. - What was that? - What was what? Have you heard? Ah, it's at the English shooting range. On the morning of Easter Monday? No, Mick, that comes from the streets. - What's going on down there? - The revolutionaries have taken the Post Office, Pearse, Connolly and Tom Clarke ...! It's the uprising! Thank God! - What happen! - It's the revolution! - Kids, come here, right away! - The English army! Fools! You crazy stupid shots! Push hard! Here they come! Cover us! What have you done! Throw away the whiskey! Johnny hasn't been home for two days. They are stopping them all putting them in prisons, churches, theaters... - Where they can find a place. - It's so quiet this morning. - What do they want? - Rumors run many and varied, but nobody knows the truth. The uprising has failed. This is the truth. And what else could we expect? But where is Johnny? That boy knows how to take care of himself better than anyone, don't worry. I have lost a lot of children. You haven't lost this one, mother. Is it over, Johnny? Yes, Mick, it's over. And forever. They have released us all. Will there be peace now? Yes. For the dead. Mother, Monsell Publishing is going to publish my book, "The History of the Irish People's Army". - I'm glad. - And they will pay me 15 pounds. - We will live in absolute luxury. - I'm proud of you. It was my duty to pay tribute of admiration to those brave men. What happens? Nothing, Johnny, it's just that I have a little bit of a cold. I am pleased with this news. It is the fruit of the great effort you have made at night. - You're a great boy. - Do not worry about me, it is you who must take care of yourself. Would you like some hot tea? No, but what I'm going to do is lie down for a little bit. Between! Yes? They send me from the other office, my name is Johnny Cassidy. And good? I am the author of "The History of the Irish People's Army" that you are going to edit. Ah, good morning, Mr. Cassidy! They told me to come get my 15 pounds. Yeah, of course. I have them here for you. - I'll put it in an envelope. - No, don't bother. - Couldn't you collect it in money? - That's money, Mr. Cassidy. Yes, but I mean if I could cash it in bills. We always pay our authors by check, it would be very difficult for us to pay in cash. - No, it's not that, it's just... - What? - Nothing. - They will pay you easily, the firm is solvent. Yes. Sorry, can you give me money for this? - 15 pounds? - That's. Do you have an account with us, Mr. Cassidy? It means that if I have money in your bank. - Naturally, that is what I mean. - No, I have no money anywhere, that's why I'm here. I'm sorry, Mr. Cassidy, we have very high standards. I don't mean to tell you a sad story... My mother is ill and I would like to buy her... a hot water bottle, some meat and some food. Sorry, Mr. Cassidy, we don't have that stuff. - Excuse me, Mr. Murphy. - But what are you doing, boy? - I owe you 18 shillings and 3 pence, right? - Yes. - Well, I've come to pay you. - What's this, a check? - It's a check for £ 15. - I don't dare to touch it, - How do I know it's authentic? - It is, they gave it to me at the publisher. I'll take it to my bank and if they tell me it's good, I'll give you the money. - I want that damn money now! - No one will give you that damn money now. Nor would I give it to you without verifying the authenticity of the check. - And will it take a long time? - Well, no more than a week. I need something now, my mother is sick and there is nothing at home. Well, I'll tell you what I can do. I'll give you credit for another 5 shillings. It is as far as I can go. It's not enough, I have to buy a hot water bottle. A hot water bottle. Wait. I wish you were a 10 shillings note! My wife lends you hers. Half a crown if you don't return it. I will return it to you. And the 5 shillings in gender you promised me? A pinch of tea? A little of bread? And how about a slice of bacon? Thank you. Your mother was very active this morning, Johnny, he will live to be one hundred years old. Hello, Mrs. Dugan. Do you mean that you have gone up to see it? No, I have not gone up, she has been here very early, hanging out the clothes she had washed herself. He joked and laughed with everyone who entered the courtyard. His laugh could be heard from a kilometer away. Mother. Are you sleeping? You're just asleep, right? Tell me you're only sleeping. Is not true? I accompany him in the feeling. His mother was a great woman. Here, it's for you. It's the bill. The bill, well... You can start putting the lid on. The lid will not be put on and there will be no burial until this bill is paid. It's just that I can't pay until I cash a check I have, your boss already knows. And I tell him that there will be no funeral until he pays the bill. - We don't want check scams. - But they can't leave my mother here. That's up to you. And you will stay unless you pay 4 pounds, 8 shillings and 7 pence. If I don't have it in 10 minutes, we'll set sail. Do whatever you want with the cold cuts. - But the check... - These are my last words. Mr. Murphy, could you give me the rest of the money you owe me on the check? My mother lies dead at home and they do n't want to take her if I don't pay the bill. Wait, it's not good to rush money matters. The check passed a couple of days ago, so no problem, But I don't think I have what you need in the drawer. Ah, but it's still early. We'll see. 1, 2, 3, 4. There goes 4 pounds to start with. And... 5, 10, 15 shillings in half crowns. 16, 17, 18 and 19. If it's for a funeral you should have told me before. Do you want two 3 pence pieces or six pieces at a time? When will you give me the rest? At the weekend, when the drawer is full. If I had known it was for burial, I would have had it ready for you. Thank you. Goodbye. Okay, Bill, nail the lid. Do you have the papers for the burial? Date prisa Bill, we have to get to the cemetery in time to place the old woman comfortably. Disrespect is a terrible thing, sir, keep that in mind. Come on, Bill. Ready! Let's go! - Let's go. - Where are the others? Hey my friend Mick is waiting for me at the cemetery my brothers are abroad. It doesn't matter, come on. Mother! Mother! Enough already, I'm tired of hearing the same thing all the time! You must not continue. You singing and your mother buried just a few hours ago. My mother is dead! It is his body that is buried! - It's the same, Johnny. - I'm telling you she's not there! Wherever you are, if you hear me sing you will hear me. She will listen and be happy too. Tomorrow we will take some flowers to his grave and you will feel different. I will not visit any grave, there is nothing that lives in a cemetery! I will never look at her grave site again. And to hell with you and your dying world... and your sense of shame! - Johnny, I don't deserve to be talked to like that. - Well, keep your mouth shut! Okay, now we'll go home, huh? We'll have a little toast before I go. By the immortal Susan Cassidy, woman and mother, for his courage, his generosity and his joyful heart. And for Johnny Cassidy and all the things he thinks to say and hopes to do! And to hell again Mullen and his dying world! This is the last toast this glass will ever make. Sorry Sorry. Come here, put on your jacket. Come on, put it on. Deep river, my... my home is on the Jordan Deep river, I wish... Hi Nora! - Oh, Johnny! - Where are you going? - I'm coming home and I'm a little late. - Let him take it. Is far? No, in Desmond Terrace, but don't bother. Desmond Terrace. It's a very dandy place, isn't it, full of dandy people. - Don't mock, Johnny, they're not bad people. - I know. Nora, we are here, under the stars, let's forget people and their insignificance and be ourselves for a few minutes. Excuse him, Miss. You buried your mother and you're a little nervous. Johnny, I didn't know. Have I heard him sing and his mother is just buried? It is not buried anywhere! But wherever he is, he 's looking at us and saying: "Johnny, why don't you take that sweet young lady and give her a kiss?" Don't you want to kiss me? Do you want to let me go home? Johnny, let the miss go home. - But I want to bring you the package! - No, someone could see it. Not today, another day, please. There may not be another day. For my part yes. - Are you mad at me? - Yes I am. Because he doesn't kiss me back. If you think you are entitled to it, take it. Johnny, please don't sing for a while. I'm very sorry about your mother. He is very sorry about my mother. It was more than indecent the way you fucked the girl last night It was against her will, she didn't like it. I think so, and a lot, I didn't hear her call any police. It would do you good to fuck a girl like that once in a while. To me? Bah, I have other things to do! I've already seen you look kindly at that plump young lady... bringing the food to the steamroller driver. Hey, dress up a bit and next time you see her tell her: "Hello precious", she will like it and you will get more juice out of life. No thanks, I don't want problems with the girls. And you would have to do the same with this Nora, yesterday I saw that she is afraid of you. Afraid of having me or afraid of losing me? What happens to you, Mick, is afraid of taking a risk. This is how shy people behave and that is not God's way. But I don't want to get into theological disquisitions. What happens to you now? I remind you that you are living in a decent house. Let's have a little... a little education. What is that? You are a brute, you fucking drunk! Scoundrel! Do you want to starve my son? Go to hell! - May I come in? - I won't stop him, honey. Do you live here? I live with Mick Mullen. My name is Johnny Cassidy. What is your concept of good neighborliness? I guess it must exist when you live so close to each other. We'll see each other, Johnny. Don't worry, I am serene. I'm glad it is. - What does he want? - Just tell him I'm sorry. Okay, sorry, okay. Let me take this to you. I live here, this is my house. - Ah, so... - Thank you. - Do you have to come in right away? - Yes. - At this very moment? - At this very moment. I wanted to talk to you... ¡Nora! ¡Nora! - Do you want to leave? - No, I do not want to. - Come down! - I can not! My father will be home in a moment. Will you please go away? No! Get down! I can never go down this street without being criticized. That's why I wanted to tell you I'm sorry. - Why? - Because of last night. My friend Mick told me that I took her in my arms. - If he did. - That's why I wanted to tell you I'm sorry. Could you come out for a minute? Good, but only a minute. How come you have time to roam around? I do not work. When I met him I didn't think he was one of those who chase girls. In addition to persecuting you, I am dedicated to writing, I am a writer. What do you write? A book of mine has already been published. And other things too. That won't get you far, you need a higher education to be a writer. Oops, sorry, I didn't mean that. That's what he thinks, Nora. An ordinary thought. A higher education, as you say, is a great thing. But wait, there are things that are going to be written in this country... By workers just like me, brutal and drunk. It will be very very disturbing, Nora. Why don't you become a part of it, Nora? KEEP THE BLOODY GAME How's that going, Johnny? Well, I sent my play to the Abbey Theater, Mick, and one of the management read it. Lady Gregory, I think. He thanked me and returned it with the comment... that it was a bit short on plot and a bit long on characters. - It's a sobering comment. - Yes. I reviewed it, rewritten it, and sent it again. He read it to a Mr. Yeats this time. He thanked me and returned it with the comment... that it was a bit short on characters and a bit long on plot. And what did you do then? - I tried again and sent it one more time. - AND? In a very kind way, the management informed me that they had lost it. Persevere, Johnny. Someday you will be able to put down the pick and shovel forever. I will do it. How is your new job going? Being a night watchman suits me. Well I'm going. I'll need the bed first thing in the morning. It's okay. You, register floor by floor. Go ahead, sergeant. Caya, don't make a noise, the English are back. - Damn those criminals! - What have they come for? Hey! Are you here or have you been taken away? Mrs. Ballynoy, is that you? Was it the English? If they. There hasn't been a moment of peace since the uprising they have bothered us more than ever since that fatal day. But they have already left, you can rest easy. Wouldn't it be better if he went back to his apartment? There could be someone out there and they would think the worst. Everybody has bad thoughts. - That's why I locked the door. - With key? So now you can light the candle. I feel shy in this negligee. After washing the only nightgown I have, I was sleeping naked. And this tablecloth is what I had on hand when the English pounded on the door. - Is your husband home? - No, he's in the field working. And luckily for him. The English scare him to death. He's so shy. Mick says that he is a good man and that he is very much in love with you. He's got a good bottom, poor man but honestly it's pitiful when we're alone and... - Understands? - Yes... Once when... You know? But you are a stout young man... And with good intentions. He would never take advantage of a woman alone in his room... and without more than a tablecloth covering his body. Truth? My arm got caught in your tablecloth. They are back! They will think that I am a light woman! And you are the culprit! Deceive me and put me in this trance! He wants to commit me to the whole neighborhood! Go outside, we are searching the house. Do not try to flee, there is an order to shoot. Englishmen! Mick, don't go in there, wait! - What happens? - The English have made us leave. - But what happens? - What the hell is it? We discovered an arsenal in the house, enough dynamite to blow up the city. The scoundrel tried to shoot, but his hand went through with a bullet. Look, here it comes! He is my husband, a good and brave man! - It's Charlie Ballynoy! - What a surprise, the shy man! Keep up your spirits Charlie, Ireland is with you! Long live the Republic! A peace treaty has been signed! Peace has been declared! Peace has been declared! There you have it, that's what you wanted: "For John Cassidy." Yes, costume rehearsals begin tonight. - It's your great illusion, eh, Johnny? - It means everything to me. - More than happiness? - Yes. - More than love? - That's love to me. Writing is love. What's wrong? Is nothing. I understand you. I hope so, Nora. I think it is time for great things. We have peace in the country. We no longer have to be afraid. We can dedicate ourselves to human things. - To beauty, to real things. - Isn't love a real thing? - Of course it is. - But between us it's not real. I'll sound cheeky, but I'll say it. I love you, Johnny. Can I kiss you? Here? The city is our home, what other better place to kiss you? Let me look at you. You are the most wonderful woman in the world. - That's just words. - The truth. - You are very good with words. - I am. - So how can I believe they are true? - They say stocks speak louder. Come here! - Do you believe in that? - Should I believe you. I am convinced that I have a great influence on you. - Because what you say? - Because you haven't spoken... of your country or your writings or politics for three hours. Give a man a beautiful day and the woman he loves and all that stuff... they are very unimportant. Would I be the most important thing to you in the world? You would be. - I have something to tell you. - I laughed? - Very serious. - Then say it. Do you hear There is a curve in your body that I have always liked, since I laid eyes on you. It's where the neck ends and the back begins. Here. - Is that what you were going to say? - Yes. That's not a serious thing, Johnny. You would have to say really serious things. You are bullying me. Can't I do it if I love you? Sometimes you seem too sure of yourself, Johnny. You still have a long way to go. I'm not afraid to walk it. - Johnny. - What, honey? Tell me. - Tell you what? - Something about the woman you love. - It's very complicated, isn't it? - I have not understood. - Neither do I. - I thought he was a very handsome man. - Come on, think about it! What nonsense! - Johnny! Oh, Johnny, she's very good, really good. Right, Mick? - Yes, very good. - No, it was a failure. No, it hasn't! Why have n't you sat down with us? - I couldn't, I was too nervous. - The public liked it very much. - I've heard some people say... - Oh, shut up and kiss me! - Mr. Cassidy? - Yes, say it. - Mr. Cassidy, the author of the play? - You want to make sure, eh? - Yes, I'm that Cassidy. - Management wishes to see you. - I'll accompany you. - Come on, go, I'll go with Nora for a drink. Don't delay, Johnny, we'll wait for you. - That old woman scares me a little. - Come on, go inside, Johnny. I Do not quite like this kind of theater. Lady Gregory, Mr. Cassidy is here. - Oh, tell him to come in. - Come in. Thank you, Mr. Cassidy. It is difficult to imagine all the paperwork that is linked to a temple of art. - Please sit down. - Thank you. We all love your work, Mr. Cassidy, and it has been a satisfaction to be able to present it at the Abbey. Not a success, huh? Well tonight's show only got £ 13 in but tomorrow it promises more, and when people start talking about the play more. But I'm not going to get my fortune out of her, am I? Very few of us do it on this job, Mr. Cassidy. But I hope that does not mean that he will not write for us. - I'm preparing another play. - Oh yeah? Great! Oh, I introduce you to Mr. Yeats, Sr. Cassidy. Don't get up. Mr. Cassidy, you have a great talent. A restless talent, but his is a voice that needs to be heard. Pay no attention to the little crowd tonight our city is not famous for welcoming the new. Ignore the gibberish critiques you will no doubt read when you wake up tomorrow. Keep your faith, stay firm in your art, we will look to the future together. His vision of life and his theme alarm me, but that does not matter, the field of literature, and especially drama, is very broad. There can be so much excitement and mystery in dirt and misery, as there is in purity. At least that's what I hope to think when I'm very old. Well, bye, Mr. Cassidy. We will see again... as fellow theater workers. We will see us again. Come on, Johnny, Yeats said pay no attention to criticism. - Here's another one, do you want to hear it? - No! - What does it say? - "In his work Mr. Cassidy ..." - I don't think this one is better. - Follow. "In his work Mr. Cassidy completely lacks the sincerity of an artist." If you were not in front I would say what I have in mind. - Should I step back a bit? - No, don't bother. - Is there any more? - Yes, there is another. Okay, read it, honey. "Mr. Cassidy in his work exploits the poor." That's written in a comfortable living room, in a posh neighborhood, and by a guy... who has never had a single thought of sympathy for the poor! Come on, baby, let's go. The play is a complete failure, Mick. - Have you packed? - No. - I'll wrap my things in a package. - Don't you have a suitcase? - No. - You can't go like this! Can't I go to Coole Park to talk to Lady Gregory... of Irish literature with a package? Of course not! I'm going to Murphy's house and see if I can find a suitcase. - I do not care. - You may not care, But there is no need to make those who love you feel ashamed. Come here. Come here. You don't have time, the train leaves in an hour. I told you to come here. - Don't you want to go to Coole House? - Naturally, a lot. But I want you to tell me one thing first. What? Take a look to the future, will you? Do you see Johnny Cassidy in me or do you see me as something else? What do you mean? I want you to climb the ladder of fame with me, as my wife. Do you want to continue my random life? No, don't be still! Or do you want to just play it safe? - Do you want me to do the trip with you? - I would like. But you're so shy, Nora. You are wonderful, but so shy. Well I... I, I'm scared, Johnny, I... I like the things I know, so I feel safe. Those dreams of yours I can't understand. Neither do I understand them. Am I one of them? No. You are real. - You have to pack. - I don't have a suitcase. - Mick is coming back. - Give me a kiss to strengthen my spirits... ante Lady Gregory. Arre, horse, arre! So horse! So, so, caballo. - Are they waiting for you? - Hope so. Artists don't come here often anymore, the glory is gone. Come on, horse, come on! Welcome to Coole House, Johnny. Come on, come in right away, you'll need to wash up after the trip. - Many thanks. - Brigitte will show you to your room. - I'll wait for you to have tea. - Thank Mrs. I'll take it. Let her carry you. I never get this to work, I always burn my fingers. Let me do it. Like great men, you are very delicate with mechanical objects. - Do you like tea, with milk and sugar? - Yes, thank you, with both. There are cupcakes there, have them if you feel like it. I want to take advantage of this circumstance, John, to ask you which writers you admire the most in Ireland at the present time. I don't know, Lady Gregory, I'm a bit young as a writer to risk answering that. Do you think we should write in a special way, to get workers to read and understand us? What? Oh come on ma'am, that's the dumbest question I've ever heard! I can see that we are going to have some very lively conversations. I like his tone, impetuous, brave. Keep it up, Johnny Cassidy. You are an attractive man, John, is there a woman in your life? Well yes, one. - And you want it? - Nora? Yes. But that has him worried. Please let us talk about something else. You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. I would like to confess something to you. I haven't felt so comfortable in a long time Since I used to sit next to my mother by the fire She talked to me about the chores of the day. And he was the only person who also called me John. Like you. You have just told me one of the greatest flatteries in the world. Why? Because even an old woman like me... You are satisfied that a young man like you feels good in your company. I have the feeling that we will become great friends. See, These are the great men of our time. Este es George Bernard Shaw. This, Yeats. And that one over there Augustus John. Record your name here, Johnny Cassidy. Me? You are worth being here, boy. My name is there, among great men. I am very proud of you. - I have to work a lot now. - I know. You should forget about me, Nora. I know. Hey, wait for me! That's Yeats's house. And I have to enter. - Do you want me to wait for you? - Yes. Look at that. Now we belong to a free state with armed guards at the gates of our poets and... Johnny! Get in now or you'll be late. - You will wait for me? - I will wait for you. "The plow and the stars". This is the best thing you have ever done. You've written a great play, Cassidy. There is brutality in her... and tenderness... and a kind of humanity that reminds me... Cassidy, you are the Irish Dostoyevsky. I'm Johnny Cassidy, nothing more. Well, John Cassidy, it will be my pleasure to represent you. There are one or two points to keep in mind in your essays, the subtle difference between the written and spoken word. You know what I mean, the pages and the scene. That knowledge makes us playwrights. Where are you going, Cassidy? Far away. Explain yourself. There is nothing to explain. The plays will be written and with the help of God and direction, they will be performed. You are young, Cassidy, and your inspiration comes naturally. But there will come a day when he is old and his inspiration will be denied him. Your youth is the source of your beautiful anger, but think of your old age, when lack of momentum advises moderation. Age, winter days, make frost a stimulus... as powerful as in youth the heat of the sun. Lovers look forward to the moment the sun goes down but when you feel old, you will see with surprise and sorrow that the sun rises every day. Your girlfriend's body heat is now your inspiration, Cassidy, but the time will come when his inspiration will come from loneliness and despair. Prepare for that moment. Bad news? - What do you mean? - Regarding the work. ¡Oh, no! Says it's the best I've ever written. He said it's good, he's going to start rehearsing at the Abbey very soon. Well, why do you have such a sad face? I don't know, I was thinking about the future. Yeats spoke of old age and... I feel you are very far from me, Johnny. Oh come on Nora, let's go back to the dirty, human parts of the city, - to the places that I love! - That's your fault, Johnny, that you often reject the things you don't understand. What do you mean by that? Well, you are more afraid than you like to confess. You need the security of seeing yourself surrounded by things you like, just as Yeats needs the security of his theater. Except that... Sometimes you censor for the wrong reasons, Johnny. That's it. Oh my darling I love u Come, We're going home. - Yeats, we have to be careful. - I have never understood... - the meaning of that word. - Oh, no kidding! This Cassidy work is like an explosive. - Good material for a theater. - You are an impossible man! Yeats, this song from the end of Act 2 of Cassidy's play... - it will have to be deleted. - Why? Why? Because it's disgusting! And what is worse, it is sung by a prostitute! It is obscene, immodest and very beautiful. And I want it to stop. Yeats, be careful! It's not just the song, it's the dialogue, it goes beyond what's permissible. It is the jargon of the people, whether they want to admit it or not. They are blind. As directors of this theater we are not here to promote blindness. The actors are not going to represent her. No actress will want to play the prostitute. Ms. Mooney has promised to take over the role. Anything else, O'Brien? I am very busy this morning. I appeal to your good judgment. Stop this Cassidy play, don't go on with it. Business is good, why destroy it? I run a theater, not a cabaret. I'm only interested in good art, not entertainment. And Cassidy's work is of excellent art. Good Morning. You are not a man! I do not allow you to interfere in my private life! Private? If you do nothing but show yourself off to get noticed! Come on, this queer is not worth arguing with! ¡Sr. Cassidy, It is not a matter of laughing, it is a tragedy! Come with me, Mr. Yeats wants to see you in his office. Come. Don't think I'm ready to receive reprimands from a vulgar prostitute! Come on, you grope providence, when you grope Flooder! Hands down! You're the one taking the risk if you start groping me! We will have a few drinks before going to your house. Oh Flooder, I'm afraid you are a terrible man for women. It is blasphemy against the decent women of this country! It is a smear against the entire Irish race! Our flag has never been seen in a brothel! - Outside! - Lower the curtain! God save Ireland! Ah, Cassidy, we need your permission for one thing. If his work is to continue we must do something urgently. They are throwing objects at the actors, the stage can be robbed. We believe it is necessary to call the police. Police? I call the police against the workers? Never! My son, what scruples! It is our police now, it is no longer the English police. Lady Gregory, it's still the police. If you want your work to continue to be performed... Yes, I guess I better call her. Do it. I will do what I can. It is shameful and cruel! Get off the stage, get out! Dare to represent this crap! We must not allow it! Outside! Outside! Go away! Lower the curtain! You have dishonored your country... - and your religion! - It is a shame! Sorry. You have ridiculed Ireland again! This is indecency! The play of an Irish genius is on stage tonight and you have rejected it... as in the past you rejected other works of other great men! I am ashamed to face you compatriots! When all of you are dead, buried and forgotten, John Cassidy's name will resonate throughout the world, to the glory of Ireland and art, wherever civilization exists! This is embarrassing, they shouldn't allow it! Let go of me! It is degrading! What audacity! Let go of me, let go of me! I have paid my ticket and I have the right to see the play! ¡Johnny! ¡Johnny Cassidy! He's written a wonderful play, but those guys don't want to let me see it! - Likes? - Of course, a lot, it's very good! I've been clapping the whole time! But those bastards have thrown me out! Thank you. Come back inside and keep clapping. Right now! It's good, very good! Very well, continue! - Just a moment. - Yes? - What do you want? - They told us there was a fight. - Yes, there is. - Ah, that's for us! - Do you want to see the play? - To hell with the play, it is the fight that interests us! - You want to cause a riot? - We don't provoke anything. We want to help the provocateurs. Then you better start right here. Thank you. And if some coward sends one of our men to the other neighborhood, you will go with him! Let's go! - Hey, no pushing! - Ahead! ¡Johnny! - Johnny, are you okay? - Yes, I'm OK. How dare you insult the holy name of Ireland? - He must have done it for money. - Come on, Johnny. You should know that there is not a prostitute in all of Ireland. He would refer to this one that accompanies him. Come on, Johnny, it's not worth it. Damn Judas! Wasn't it enough to betray your class with all that crap, make these men and women foul-mouthed and dissolute, without faith and without hope? Showing them to the world as idiotic crooks, isn't that enough? Mick, it has to be like that, a writer puts what he sees, I have to tell the truth. Ah, you can use good words. Do you tell the truth? And is it necessary to make an unfair display of your friends? It's my way of working! Oh, do you work like this now? Put our room on the stage the one we shared when you were homeless, and put me like... a fool, a cretin, so that all of Dublin can laugh at me? - Is that the truth Johnny Cassidy? - Mick, listen and try to understand! Showing the world as it is maybe we can change it! - I have confidence in what I do! - I don't want to hear your arguments anymore! I will appreciate if you take your things and go away from me! I never want to see you again, Johnny Cassidy, after what you've done to me. ¡Cassidy! I hope this will not be a reason for you to leave the theater. No, Sr. Yeats. This is your site. If it is to mean anything in the world... It will be between four walls like these, that is, in a theater. They tried to destroy me tonight. Oh sure they tried to destroy it for what you are: Dangerous. They tried me. And with Synge, before us. I don't think he is afraid to confront the public. It captivates me. What would you say if tonight they had applauded your work and at the end you had said: "Very pretty, very pretty"? "A respectable work, written by a respectable, God-fearing young man." What would you have done then? I would not have written another word. But you will keep writing, eh? We will be proud to mount another work of his at the Abbey. But do not forget that there are theaters in all the great cities of the world, London, New York, Moscow, Berlin, Paris... And as a playwright, Johnny, they all belong to you. Well, have a good time. Goodnight. Goodnight. New York, Paris, London, Moscow... Marry me, Nora. No, Johnny. Why, do I love you, Nora? I've seen your face when Yeats was talking to you... - about the world and its theaters. - What does it have to do with? - You must go there. - Come with me. I couldn't, I can't live in that world - I can't change. - I don't want you to change. If necessary, I will change the world. My dear Johnny... - Nothing is impossible for you now, right? - Nothing. - Come with me, be my wife. - I would die... in your fantasy world. I would die. - You don't love me then? - Oh my gosh, Johnny, I love you with all my heart, I will never love anyone like that! So come with me, come with me as my wife. No. It would prevent you from doing many things, "Nora doesn't understand this, Nora doesn't like that", and you wouldn't and it would complicate your life. I am a simple woman and I need a simple life, not your fantastic dreams and your character. - Stay with me, Nora! - No, Johnny, try to understand, it's because I love you that I'm leaving! Do I have to lose everything to continue my career? Losing friends, discovering that the city I love hates me, lose family? And now to you - Should I lose you too? - Yes, Johnny! Can't I take anything with me? - No! - Nora! - I love you! - And I love you, Johnny! Half crown? You must be rich. Yes.
