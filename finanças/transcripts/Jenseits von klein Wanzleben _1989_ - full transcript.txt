Excuse us. We're from the film academy. Do you know where Zimbabwe is? -What was it again? -Zimbabwe. Wait. I've heard of it. Zimbabwe... It's in Africa! Yes, anyhow. -Hunh? What? -Zimbabwe. -It's a country. -Yes, I know. In Africa, anyhow. -Where specifically? -In South Africa? -No idea. -Not even the continent? It's in Asia, I'd say. -Asia? -Yes. Do you know that someone from Klein Wanzleben works there? No. Far from Klein Wanzleben Ronald, how'd you end up in Mashayamombe in Zimbabwe from Klein Wanzleben? Through the Friendship Brigades! My story is a long one, with applications, interviews, preparatory classes, specialized technical training from the Party. Short-term service in Ethiopia, longer-term service in the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. And now service in Zimbabwe. I'm looking for new, different opportunities for employment - to challenge myself, to affirm myself. I'm looking for adventure. I'm looking for uncertainty. I'm trying to abandon the mundane life of the sheltered GDR, where everything is predetermined. I'm looking for something else, something unfamiliar, something thrilling, and much, much more. Our Education Center is located 120 km southwest of Harare. In the beginning, there was nothing out there. The building's foundations had to be dug. That was the Youth Education Center ''Mashayamombe,'' for which we were told to get all the necessary resources so that the next brigade could begin operations in the summer. We got desperate, of course, but then we got support from the Embassy, etc. We finished framing the barracks in June. We moved in right away. But we had no water, nothing. So we weren't able to really live out here. Every Monday we brought in provisions and water supplies, and lived here until Friday, when we left the center again so we could properly wash and rest. We had one gas cooker with one burner. Times were tough. You felt surrounded by the bush. Everything was a wall of green. The bush was right outside our houses. There were no streets. None of the land was cleared. Our supplies finally came in May '88, I think. The containers were out here. Then we had a big problem: our furniture had no place to go because we had no room for it. We had so much furniture that it actually got in our way. We didn't have water until the first school year - so we've had water since the summer of '88. It was a momentous occasion when I got into the bathtub with a candle and a bottle of beer. I got out of that tub with a feeling I hadn't had since I came to Mashayamombe: that I was clean once again. That gave us courage. We thought about our wives and kids. At some point, when we look back on all we've been through; the great dangers posed by snakes and criminals, etc., no longer matter. Now I no longer feel like I'm living in the bush. I live in Camp Mashayamombe. Our present brigade consists of 6 FDJ volunteers. That's the Stoll family. There's Jörg Stoll, the masonry instructor. Annette Stoll, our interpreter, financial adviser and secretary. And Daniel Stoll. Then there's the Schoner family. Reinhard Schoner is the chief plumbing instructor. Christine Schoner is responsible for our provisions. Christian Schoner is in the 2nd grade. And the Koch family, my own. Annette is responsible for child care. She's the schoolteacher. I'm the appointed leader of the brigade. And our son Oliver, who's in the 3rd grade. What do you think of living out here and owning wall cabinets? Isn't that a little funny? Isn't that what you wanted to leave behind? I can't say. It didn't have to be built-in cabinets. We got simple, flat boards delivered to us. Those suit our small rooms a lot better, but... ...first off, we had a lot of stuff to store, and secondly, with this décor in our houses in Mashayamombe, we have created a sanctuary where we can retreat from, and forget about, the red earth, the dust. What do you think, Annette? Well, we're not so much fleeing from comforts we had at home as much as from everyday life in the GDR, which doesn't have much to do with day-to-day comfort. I always say that, whenever the central council offered, we had them send us furniture. Why should we be left to rot and be eaten by termites and rats? Why shouldn't we make things comfortable for ourselves? We brought wallpaper and fabric from home before we knew that furniture could be sent here - to make it more homey. You can do without much when you're alone out here, as a single adult or childless married couple. But when you have a kid out here for 3 years, you've got to try to make your home as cozy as it was in the GDR. Why should the child do without these privileges? Excuse me, Jörg. Is it worth it for the brigade to be here? You only have 22 apprentices at the moment. Well, it'll pay off in the end. First off, we're here to build the Center itself. We have apprentices who got an academic education last year, and now they're getting hands-on training. We're building the Center with these 22 people. 18 of these houses were mostly put together by us alone. You can already see and feel the results. We're like their mentors. We're doing our small part out here in the bush. Yet I think there's a need. The cities are overcrowded, the townships are full of people. I think it's very important to give people jobs where they originally lived: in the countryside. Some of the city dwellers might return to the country. We're fighting urban migration. So we're doing our part by helping out on this project. -You may start. -Attention! Mrs. Koch, the 2nd & 3rd graders are prepared for instruction. For peace and socialism, be prepared! -Always prepared! -Please sit down. I'd like to ask some questions that concern both grades. First: what season is it at home? Whoever knows, raise your hand. What season is it at home in the GDR? Oliver. -Spring. -In a complete sentence? -Spring is the season in April. -At home. Does anyone know what it is in Zimbabwe right now? What season? -Summer? -No. -Oliver? -Fall. Yes, fall. It's almost winter. This is because we're under the equator, so it's reversed. But Daniel's also right. The sun is shining outside. It doesn't seem like winter to us. 3rd graders, you've now learned in your local history class who played the greatest role in ending the War. Which army was it? Do you remember? -Oliver? -The Red Army. Yes. The Red or Soviet Army. They fought off the fascists and the last battles were in Berlin. And what happened there is told in the story in our storybook: ''Master Sergeant Maslov's Deed.'' So Dani: please begin. ''Mommy! Mommy!" the voice kept crying. ''A child, '' said one of the soldiers. They looked everywhere. Where could it be? Annette? Could you come over here for a sec? Could you show us around the closet that contains everything? Theoretically, we've got it all. Here are the dishes, detergent, Wofasept cleaning solution, many candles. Not to mention toilet paper. We have camping bags, which are needed now and then. We've got pots, Wittol for washing the floors. This whole cabinet is full of writing materials: notebooks, envelopes, notecards. Anything you might need. Here's the closet inventory. Lamps. Keys. Buckets. Isn't it a bit costly to send so much toilet paper to Zimbabwe? It is costly, especially since you can buy toilet paper here. Do you think it's sensible? Sensible... not really. We often buy toilet paper around here. But it's somehow comforting. And those are your FDJ shirts next to them? Yes. This is our FDJ area: FDJ shirts, FDJ blouses. You don't wear these everyday, right? Not most days, no. Only on special occasions. Why not everyday? An FDJ blouse is a dress item. It's intended for that. It's not work clothes. We agreed from the very beginning that FDJ clothes would only be worn on special occasions. It'd be impossible for the men to wear while teaching. They'd have to change their clothes every day. It's not the most practical clothing at home either. Wait, sorry! Excuse us. Where'd you get that shirt? I got it from the brigade working here. -From Ronald? -Yes. Do you wear this every day? No. Only for special occasions like this one. When we go out in public, we have different clothes. We put on suits. But when I'm wearing this shirt, I'm no longer a resident of the Southern Hemisphere, but one of the Northern, specifically East Germany. I don't like going to Harare, to the grocery stores. You go to one and they don't have this or that, so you've got to go to the next store. It's much nicer at home. It doesn't take as long to get through the grocery stores. In our town, there's just one grocery store and no others. We don't need to go anywhere else. I once said: ''To live in capitalism under the welfare of a socialist country is really extraordinary.'' You get to see the disadvantages of this system: unemployment, lack of money, few or no labor union rights, - whatever happens or could happen around here. None of it applies to me. I can enjoy the best of both worlds here. As one of the youngest members of the brigade, have you at any point regretted coming to Zimbabwe? Were there moments that were painful for you? No, nothing painful. Sometimes there are moments when I've had enough. When you're in the kitchen, the heat, the monotony, peeling the potatoes, cooking the meat. But then it passes. Do you get homesick? In the beginning, of course. You get used to it. Recommendations of the Cook: Who's scheduled to dry dishes today? The one who brings it up. -It's Robert's turn. -Robert's doing it. -It's always Robert's turn. -Well what about it? -It'll run away. -Good. Enjoy your meal. Goat shank! Yes. Should we kill it? Or should we let it live? Let it live! You have to eat it too. You cut it off, you have to eat it. You, you! Yes, sir. Now eat it. -Are you here often, Rainer? -Yes. On the weekends, if there's time. Is it important for you to see the countryside and the people? Yes. The silence is impressive to me. And how they wash their clothes. Most importantly, this spot has plenty of fish. It's a lot of fun to fish here. Will you miss it when you go home? Sure. There's just mountains in Thuringia. I have to drive 100 km to get to the nearest big body of water. You can fish near Erfurt. We don't have many places to fish. Then there are the restricted areas. You can't go there. You can leave the country, but can't enter that area. Is there anything you'd take back with you? Anything you've noticed in the people as you've worked with them? The candor, kindness and open-mindedness, I'd say. You can talk with anyone. Like when I'm fishing, for example. Last week, a 15 year-old girl asked me if she could help fish. Then she told me her troubles: her school has no teachers, etc. They're looking for contact and aren't the way we are. They're very open-minded and extremely honest. Everybody knows everybody in the village. So cohesion, community and communication all go together. You're not an outsider. You're fully integrated. I have never seen apprentices so eager to learn in my life. People at home could learn a thing or two from them. They can do things that we didn't do until our 2nd year. We're far removed from such a positive work attitude. My job is to let them take away various things. Practical experience that, whether they get a job or use it in the village, they can use to start something new. I'd become a falconer in an instant, if I could. The chickens are now five-and-a-half weeks old. The monkey doesn't get along with the chickens? Right. He pulls out their tailfeathers, the rascal. So I can't stand him either. -What about his opinion? -Well... ...he shows proper respect. Our rabbit has also grown very plump. -They've still got food. -Look in the nest for any eggs. -No. -Here put in a little more. -No eggs from them. -As if! Each chicken cost $7.50. That'd be one expensive chicken noodle soup. When I wash his face, he always closes his eyes. -What's in the bucket? -Wofasept cleanser. -Wofasept? -Yes. Now you're handsome again. Three, four... A bird flies in and lands on my foot. It has a note in its beak, a greeting from my mother. The dear bird flies off, taking a greeting and a kiss, because I cannot go with it, since I have to stay here. ''Yes, there are strange things in the world, things that no school teaches and are hard to think about. You stand at the equator and don't know if you should remove all your clothes, it's so hot. Then there's this snowman standing in front of me with a colorful turban and a banana nose.'' What are you washing your hair with, Jörg? Anti-lice shampoo. Do you get them from the animals here? Yes. You get them around here: lice, fleas, and other small things. They itch terribly, but it's better with this shampoo. Then they don't itch so bad. Have you ever bathed in the river? No. There are schistosomes in there. Those are much smaller, and the shampoo won't get rid of them. You get them from snails, schistosomes. They're worms, carried by snails, and they burrow through your skin and eat your liver. Ronald once said that when you go abroad, you're on a quest. Is that true for you? Are you seeking something that you can't get at home? Sure. Getting to know people of other nations, different people. Seeing how it really is in Africa. You hear so much about Africa. It's good to be able to see the place yourself. To see how it is here. To be able to talk with the people. To be able to say later: ''I know from personal experience.'' I think that's better than just reading or hearing about it. Especially because our travel options are so restricted, unlike in any other country. You have to fight for every trip, pass practical exams, be cleared by the authorities and everything. Everybody out! Zimbabwe is of interest to the GDR because it has only existed for 9 years. Zimbabwe is so interesting in how it resolves contradictions that are simply part of its daily existence. There are many factors that don't fit our clichés or stereotyped thinking. When we say: ''That can't work. It must be this or that way.'' Zimbabwe demonstrates, as we have learned, that many ways work exactly as ours do: with a rational approach and search for a solution. But as to whether that's always the case, it isn't. Neither in Zimbabwe nor in the GDR. There are no absolutes in the development of societies, and there are none in Zimbabwe. I believe I can say from my job and my experiences that I think it's important to challenge yourself in a profession where success isn't always assured. Where failure, uncertainty, unpredictability and incalculable variables play a significant role. I think that's important. Has your service in Zimbabwe changed your view of the GDR? It has changed, indeed. It has changed so that I won't just accept things the way they are in the GDR like I did earlier. I won't think anything's ''normal,'' like the others do. You have to think about things, ponder them and ask yourself: ''Why is it this way?'' and look for deeper causes, not just what's on the surface.
