Buy your presents for each other, okay. - An hour, we need a lot more time than that. Four or five hours at least. - Alex, just relax. - I'll pick you up in one hour. - An hour's not enough. - Come on Alex. - [Alex] An hour and 10 minutes? - Bye Mom. - Bye honey. See you both in one hour. - Okay Mom. - [Man] It is plastic. It's good, buy plastic, buy plastic, buy plastic! - [Alex] How 'bout this door? - No, he has a mean face. - Should we try this door? - [Heidi] Okay. - Cool. Heidi wake up! Wake up! - Is it Christmas already? - Not 'til morning, but look. - What is it? - It's the present I got you for Christmas. But it's not supposed to do that. You unwrap it, it's your present. - [Irv] Let me out of here. I'm getting nauseated. - What's this? - Let me outta here! Shh, you wanna make my head explode? - Is it supposed to do that? - Maybe it's battery operated. - I'm not battery operated, I'm an elf. You see any battery compartment there? Come on kids, you gotta get me outta here. - How? - Unscrew the top of the globe, hurry up. - Where is he? - [Irv] I'm down here. - Where did you come from? - Where do ya think I came from? Hawaii? I don't think so, I'm an elf and everyone know that elves come from the North Pole. ♪ As a junior elf, I was sullen, sad and wimpish. ♪ ♪ I couldn't bring myself to see the joys of being impish. ♪ ♪ I'm easy to please ♪ ♪ I don't take up much space ♪ ♪ I get out of any jam ♪ ♪ I may not be a Goliath ♪ ♪ But I'm great the way I am ♪ ♪ Good things come in small packages ♪ ♪ So don't be quick to condemn ♪ ♪ Diamonds fit in small packages ♪ ♪ And I'm the ultimate gem ♪ ♪ Woop a de doo ♪ ♪ I feel bigger than Hercules ♪ ♪ Though currently I'm barely a half inch tall ♪ ♪ Good things come in small packages ♪ ♪ And I'm the best of them all ♪ ♪ No you won't hear me complain ♪ ♪ Dear Santa's 3/4 right hand guy ♪ ♪ 'Cause without me all the reindeer ♪ ♪ Wouldn't have a clue how to fly ♪ ♪ No way ♪ ♪ Watch me now as I click my heels ♪ ♪ And disappear in a cloud ♪ ♪ Big folks don't know how great it feels ♪ ♪ To not stand up in a crowd ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ I'm content to be little me ♪ ♪ 'Cause the bigger they are ♪ ♪ The harder they're gonna fall ♪ ♪ Good things come in small packages ♪ ♪ And you're the smallest of all ♪ ♪ Ain't it the truth ♪ ♪ But I'm the best of them all ♪ Haha, I love you kids. - So how'd you end up at the toy store? - Somebody at the North Pole wanted me out of the way, so they stuck me in that globe and then mailed me out. I've been sitting in there for months. You realize how boring that is? That little house didn't even have cable TV. Now listen kids, I need your help to get back to Santa's workshop. 'Cause I'm the one who's in charge, of making the reindeer fly on Christmas Eve and if they don't fly, well there's no Christmas presents for anyone. Capisce? - But why do you need our help? - Because I'm only half an inch high, that's why. Somebody's gonna step on me. - Okay, you don't need to shout, we'll go with you. - Oh thank you. - But how do we get there? We're not old enough to drive and you're not big enough. - It's a cinch, you know that ice is frozen water right? Well mirrors are frozen magic! They separate the real world from the magic world. - Real magic? - Of course it's real magic. You think I'd waste my time on fake magic? You ain't seen nothing yet. - Cool! - It's melting. - Don't worry about it. As long as you come back through the mirror before it melts all the way, you can get back to your house. You guys ready to go? - You want us to hop through the mirror with you, just like that? - Yes. - What are we waiting for? Let's go! - But I've gotta pack. And I'll need traveler's checks. I'll need shots and. - I'm waiting. At the rate you're moving, I'm gonna be ready for the old elf home, before we get to the North Pole. - [Alex] So let's go. - [Heidi] Alex, wait! - Uh oh, now they've done it. Ah! - Is this Santa's workshop? - No it doesn't even look like Santa's workshop, it doesn't even smell like Santa's workshop. It's not Santa's workshop, okay. It's all because you jumped through the mirror before I was ready. Oh now we're gonna have to walk. - But you said you wanted to get going. - I did not. - Did too. - Did not. - Did too. - Did not! - Did not. - Did too. - Told you so. - That's the last time I get into a debate with you kid. So let's get going already. - Shoo! - Pinocchio, you've been telling lies again! - I'm afraid you're right. See I told the truth. What brings you folks to this part of the forest? - We're on our way back to Santa's workshop. - Do you know the way to the North Pole? - Sure I do, I've been there a hundred times, yeah. - Are you sure about this? - Sure I'm sure, Santa and I used to double-date every Saturday night. - Yeah but can you show us the way? - No problem, you'll be there in no time. Well, maybe I know the way but it might take you a little while. Okay, okay, I have no idea where the North Pole is and you might as well give up all hope right now. Stop the cartoon, these people are doomed, toast, kaput. - Cut that out, get outta here, scram. We got another half hour of cartoon to go here. Don't you have any advice for us? - North is that way. - Come on kids. - I tell you, they're toast. Absolute toast. - Should they start the test? - Yes, go ahead. I just hope this one works. - Start the test! - Start the test. One, two, three, fly! - It's still not working. Oh it's only a couple of hours before I have to leave. - This is all Irv's fault. He was the one who sabotaged the production line. And he was the one in charge of making the reindeer fly. - I know, I know. I just don't understand how he could turn out to be so bad. - Santa's gonna be so happy to see me. He's probably worried sick. - Hurry, hurry, hurry. No time to waste. Buy this soda can emptier. It empties the can before you drink it. What could be more efficient? - Scram, we ain't interested. - Ah there's more. Are you tired of pesky insects? Well I have something that's absolutely guaranteed to esquirmanate any insect on earth. Simply place the offending insect on this block, then hit it with this special hammer. And then repeat if necessary. And now for my most spectacular offering. Not available in stores. This is a one time offer. Hurry, hurry, hurry! A magic bean guaranteed to grow into an absolutely humongous bean stalk! If it doesn't grow, just try to find me. - I told you we ain't interested. Come on kids let's go. - I want it. - And it's only 2,000 bucks! Will that be cash or credit card? I don't have any money. - Well luckily for you, I have a special year-end clearance sale going on right now. Give me your watch and it's yours kid. - Don't do it. - Sold, it's been a pleasure doing business with ya. - Wow a magic bean. - [Heidi] What's that? - Is that Santa's workshop? - Ah no. - Look at all the candy. - Don't touch it. No don't, oh. - Help, let us out! Let us out, help! Didn't I tell you not to take the candy? Didn't I tell you, but no. You had to take the candy. - [Alex And Heidi] Help, let us out.

We're Alex and Heidi. - Alex and Heidi? Well that's close enough for me. - [Irv] Let us outta here you nasty old cow. - My, children are so rude these days. - Let us out! I said, let us out! - Can it be? It can't be. But it is. Oh the humanity. It's Irv. Hello operator? Get me the North Pole. - [Man] I told you never to call me here. What, you saw Irv? What are you crazy? I mailed him out of here myself. Well then, get rid of him. - I almost forgot, I still have the magic bean. - Magic, schmagic. - Do I have to do everything myself? No! You come back here. Oof, I hate it when that happens. - Hi, I'm Jack, how you doin'? Hey pretty good beanstalk you got here. What'd you pay for this baby? - I traded my wristwatch. - A watch? A watch, sheesh, I had to trade a donkey and clean out the stables and walk 10 miles backwards in the snow with no shoes on and get up at the crack of dawn and sell newspapers to the entire kingdom and that was just to raise the down payment and you traded for one measly watch? What kinda watch? - It doesn't matter what kind of watch, you moron! - We're looking for the North Pole! Do you know the way? - No problem, come over here. That's it there. You guys have a way to go. Uh-oh. - What uh-oh, what? - Well nice to meet you folks but gotta go. - Get a leaf, a leaf. - Fee fi fo filth. I smell a stinking elf. - What are you waiting for, jump! - Now I've got you. How much more of this abuse do I have to take? Get me the North Pole and make it snappy! - One, two, three, fly! - [Witch] They're on their way to the North Pole. You gotta do something about it. - [Man] No, you gotta do something about it. I'm here making sure these reindeer never fly. - [Elf] One, two, three, fly. - It's melting! - So we gotta keep moving. Just try not to talk to anyone from now on, all right? It only gets us into trouble. - Stop, stop, don't eat that apple! It's poisoned! - Nonsense, it's a lovely apple. - Stop! - I think you've been out in the sun too long, little girl. - Look it's Halley's Comet. - No! - Yes! - No! - Stop that! - Stop it, stop it, stop it! Have you kids gone crazy! You never, ever, ever touch an A-list fairy tale character. Not like this, not like this. And especially not like this. - Gotcha! - Now look what you've done! You've spoiled my lovely, pile of pulsating green goo, yuck. - An apple a day could put you away. - Thank you, how ever did you know it was poisoned? - Oh it's a famous story and your name is Snow White, isn't it? - Why yes, that's amazing. - We're looking for the North Pole. Do you know the way? - Why yes, you just keep walking down the path that way. You seem to know so much about me little girl. Can you tell me what lies in my future? - Sure there's a handsome prince out looking for you. He gives you a big kiss and you live happily every after. - Ah! - What's wrong? - You mean to tell me there's a prince looking for me? And I'm spending all my time cooking and sweeping and washing and making the beds and wrecking my nails for those seven dwarves? When you tell me there's a prince looking for me? Haha, if that doesn't top all. Men, you can't trust any of 'em. Even the short ones, especially the short ones. - Don't look at me. - Ha, this'll show that little elf. - [Robot] Attention, attention, this way to the North Pole. Detour, detour. - Beautiful. - [Robot] Attention. - Oh no. To pull off my mean trick, I need some electric on, on, on. On, on, on. - [Irv] You kids don't seem to understand that in this world, almost anything can get you into trouble. You gotta keep on your toes. - [Heidi] We know Irv, we know. - Well that wasn't so bad. That was bad. - I'm sure it will work this time Santa. - One, two, three, fly! Hooray, hooray! - Why did Irv leave? Why, why? Is it something I did? - Of course not Santa. You just have to admit to yourself, Irv is a bad, bad elf. We're better off without him. - What's that? - Oh it's so beautiful. - Sheesh princes are thicker than flies around here. - Pardon me. - Shoo, we ain't interested. - Don't be so rude. You're not looking for Snow White, are you? - No. - Then you must be looking for Cinderella. - Thank you child. What is it? Is it a vase? - We're obviously dealing with a mental giant here. No it's not a vase, you numbskull. - Is it a glass sailboat? - No. - Is it a frozen yogurt glass? - No. - Is it a goldfish bowl? - No, no, no. What are you the spokesman for the buffoon boy association? Hello, is anybody home in there? - [Man] No. - Are you sure about that? - [Man] No. - Can you say anything but no? - [Man] Why? - I rest my case. - It's a glass slipper. You have to try it on the foot of every maiden in the land. And the one it fits will be Cinderella. - You don't say. A glass slipper. Isn't that terribly impractical? - Well that's the way the story goes. We'll help you. - Nope, nix, uh-uh. That'll take forever, we gotta amscray to the North Pole. - We can't just desert the prince. He's depressed. - He's depressed, what about me? Hey I'm the one who's half an inch high, let's go. - No, we have to help him. - Let's see if I can speed this up a little. Hey girls, the prince wants to marry you. You'll have everything. - Push harder honey. - I am pushing. - Next. - Could it be? Oh ecstasy. Darling come away with me. Together we'll work long hours and move into a small apartment and we'll live with my mother. - [Man] That's not right, cut, cut, cut. Those are the wrong cue cards. Will you please try to pay attention? - [Man With Cue Cards] Oh sorry. - Darling be my bride and come live with me in the palace and enjoy a life of incredible luxury. - Of course darling. - Oh double ecstasy. - Oh evil stepmother will be so happy. - Evil stepmother? - Yes and my uncle Harry and my auntie Ruth and cousin Fred and cousin Sam and cousin Ralph and my half-nephew Larry and my niece Stephanie and my cute little niece Nugella and my adorable nephew Alphonso and my uncle from the old country Igor and my great, great, great grand uncle. - Ah do you children know the way to the nearest dentist? - Dentist? - Yes I'm feeling the need for two or three months of painful dental work. Anything to avoid marrying her. I'd rather have root canals. - We're looking for the North Pole. And we can't even find it. - The North Pole? Why didn't you say so before you gave me all that help? That would have saved us all so much trouble. The North Pole is just over the next hill. That way. - [Cinderella] Oh prince, come back! I want you to meet my half-uncle Stanley. - Sorry, gotta run. - And my great, great 2/3 aunt Dispepsy and my fourth cousin twice removed Emily and my 3/4 aunt on my mother's side, Esmeralda and my, thanks kids. You've been so swell. - [Alex] There it is! - You see, the prince was right about where to find it. If you help other people, they'll help you. - Right kid right. Now let's go! - [Man] Witch, they're coming. You better get your broom over here, now. - Yes may I help you? - Blinky it's me! - Ah! Santa come quick, it's evil Irv! - Irv be careful! - You're certain it was Irv? - Yes he was horrible. I hope I never see him again. Ah, it's evil Irv! - Irv, you're back! - Be careful Santa. He sabotaged the whole production line. You may be next. - Santa it wasn't me. I swear, I swear! Do you think I'd shrink down to peanut size on purpose? - Well. - Yes, you're bad. - Blinky please. No I don't suppose you would do it on purpose. But if it wasn't you, then who was it? Well I'm not sure. But I'd put my bet on Miss Wartnose of 1934. - The witch, of course! - La, la, la, lou. It's time for kiddie stew. - Look the snowflake! - Now we'll never get home. - Who's there? - [Santa] It's Santa Clause. - Ha, I'm sure. Who's there, really? - [Santa] Santa Clause. - Okay fella, I'll give one last chance to identify yourself before I zap you from here to Christmas. Who's there? - [Santa] Candy gram! - Candy gram? I love candy, come in, come in. - Here's the candy. - And I thought show business was glamorous. - You're safe. Here are the two good children who helped save Irv. And Christmas. The saboteur wasn't Irv, it was the witch all the time. So bar the door in case she returns and let's get busy. There isn't a minute to waste. - Where is Irv? - Over there. - All right, all right, I like you too but I gotta get to work. Okay, let's get busy with the flight plan for tonight's trip. - Why the sad faces, it's Christmas Eve? - We need the snowflake to get back through the mirror and it melted. - So now we can't get home. (crying) - Don't worry. (chuckling) Your house is one of my regular stops. I'll be happy to take ya home. - Really? - There's nothing that would make me happier. - Are you guys ready to fly? Okay, here's the plan. Got it? Okay now, one, two, three, fly! - [Witch] Santa, let me in! - Don't worry, she can't get in, the door is barred. - At last! Now we're having fun! - How could you let her in? - Because I'm not Blinky. - Who are you? - They call me Mr. Trench. I'm head of the Plastic Toy Corporation. Where our motto is, if a toy lasts 20 minutes, that's just too long. And that's the way we like 'em. Santa was cutting into my business, so I made a deal with Ms. Witch here to put the old guy out of commission for good. - You're a fiend. - Why thank you. Okay, witch do your worst. - With pleasure. Ha, Christmas is canceled. No presents, so no Christmas. All your hard work is for nothing, nothing, nothing! - It's not canceled, you wicked old witch. - Is too, is too. No presents, no Christmas. - Christmas isn't just presents. It's good times with your family and your friends. If you had a friend, you'd know that. - I've got loads of friends. Why there's, oh someone dropped a house on her. Why there's, no he's in jail for tax evasion. I know, my broomstick is my friend. Why there's, there's Mr. Trench. Mr. Trench is my friend. - Are you nuts? I'm not your friend. This is strictly business, babe. After we wipe out Santa, I'm outta here. - But sweetie, I really, really thought we were friends. - Haha, I don't think so. - You know what, I would be your friend if you let me. - What are you waiting for, zap the kids! Zap the kids! - And I'd be your friend too. Mr. Trench is mean, don't pay any attention to him. You could be nice if you tried. - I don't need any friends. I'm a witch. I'm wicked, that's all I need. - But even you must get lonely sometimes. Think how nice it would be to have someone to call up and just talk to. - Here's a quarter, call someone who cares. I'm sick of this psychobabble stuff. Zap the kids, zap the kids. If you don't zap them in the next five seconds, I'm gonna throw a bucket of water on you. - Oh you are, are you? You know, maybe I could use some friends. I always knew I liked children. Of course, I meant baked children. But I never knew live children could be so nice. - Zap the kids, zap the kids! - How do you like them apples, Mr. zap the kids Trench? - Not so fast, Christmas is still canceled. I'm gonna wipe out those presents if it's the last thing I do. - [Irv] Stop it. - No! Let me out of here! - Don't look at me.
