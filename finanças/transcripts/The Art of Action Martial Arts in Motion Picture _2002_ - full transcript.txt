This is a story of how the martial arts film genre was born... ...in a bloody rebellion... ...and transformed itself... ...into a spiritual and creative revolution. A martial artist has to take responsibility for himself... ...and accept the consequences of his own doing. - What is the highest technique? - To have no technique. What are your thoughts when facing an opponent? - There is no opponent. - Why is that? Because the word "I" does not exist. A good fight should be like a small play... ...but played seriously. When the opponent expands, I contract. When he contracts, I expand. And when there is an opportunity... ...I do not hit... ...it hits all by itself. Martial arts films have a Chinese expression: Wu xia. Wu means martial arts, which signifies action. Xia conveys chivalry. Wu xia expresses the great dichotomy that martial arts is: Deeply spiritual, yet potentially deadly. In the best of martial arts films, the themes are profoundly noble... ...and yet filled with breathtaking action. It is this combination, infused with romance and humour... ...that has made this genre one of the most popular in the world. It is enjoying both box-office and critical success. Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon... ...was nominated for 10 Oscars, including Best Picture, and won four. Rush Hour 2 was America's number one live-action comedy film of 2001. Help! And The Matrix... ...pushed special effects and choreography to a whole new level. You are about to discover who its original pioneers were... ...and who is driving this phenomenal film revolution today. Everybody's got the idea wrong. They think it's kicking and punching. They miss the way-of-life thing... ...and the idea that what it's really supposed to do... ...is improve the texture of your life and the people around you. How and where did Chinese filmmakers... ...discover the possibilities of martial arts? From that came this. Yes, martial arts films derived from opera. But not just any opera. Peking Opera has been part of Chinese culture for centuries. And how did martial arts become a part of opera? Well, it occurred in the mid-1760s. When the Manchu Dynasty was taking over... ...they basically made Shaolin, the monastery, illegal. So they set about destroying the Shaolin Temple. And five men-- Students, disciples... ...out of hundreds, were able to escape. They see that their whole livelihood, their brothers, everyone is dying... ...and they decide to challenge the Manchu masters. Out of the ruins, they find their weapons... ...they find whatever speciality they want to use to express themselves... ...in this last, pitched battle. They train, and they train hard. And it's life-and-death, and it's a battle... ...and three out of the five survive their battle. But they preserve the Shaolin lore. Like a phoenix coming out of its own ashes... ...they found their strength from the ashes of the monastery. They went back to their roots to have this battle, to fight... ...to do something grander, bigger than yourself. I think that's what... ...makes for heroes, you know. Whether real life or, you know, cinematic heroes... ...you look for something worth fighting for... ...and it's greater, grander a concept than just for yourself. One monk who survived the burning temple was Master Zhi Shan. During the battles in 1765, he taught his skills to the Peking Opera actors. Zhi Shan did this for two reasons: First, to continue teaching the Shaolin traditions of martial arts... ...that the Ching Empire was trying to eradicate. And secondly, to spread the seeds of revolt... ...to anyone who might want to rise up against the tyrant of that time. The opera players passed on this knowledge and skill as they toured. Nearly a century later, in 1850, for the first time in Chinese history... ...a group of actors joined a rebellion against the Ching Dynasty. When it failed, the authorities banned all theatre and opera. Actors performed in secret... ...so that their traditions, enhanced by the dynamics of martial arts... ...would not be lost. Twenty years later, the new government relented. That's the remarkable connection between the Peking Opera... ...and the Shaolin Temple's martial arts and its Buddhist teachings. You learn martial art not to fight. You learn to discipline yourself. And I found that quality in martial art film fantastic. When movies began in China in the early 1900s... ...actors were needed. They were found at the local Peking Opera shows. Peking Opera had no women. It was male-dominated. This wasn't theatre for guys who liked to dress in women's clothes. Many major actors today grew up in the Peking Opera schools... ...and one thing that has not changed over the years is the training. It is still intense, exhaustive, extreme... ...and often downright brutal. When I was 7, I was in the school training from 5:00 a.m. until night. Very tough training. The teacher said, "Come. Come here. I think it's about time you have a Zha jiang min." I was in big shock. Even my father, my parents, never hit me like this. Your master punished you. I think at that time, whipping is very popular. Not only when learning Peking Opera, but even in the apprentice trades... ...you're open to punishment from your master. I saw with my own eyes that at that time... ...whipping was quite effective. For centuries, acting has been frowned upon as dishonourable. Men performing as women in Peking Opera... ...was an acceptable practice. When movies began, it was considered such an inferior art... ...that male actors would not lower themselves to perform in them. So women became the stars. Tough martial arts were performed by women dressed as men. Go figure. The first female martial artist star was Fen Juhua. She later taught martial arts, mainly to actresses. Tam Sau-zhen had an opera company before her 40-year film career. But without a doubt, the most accomplished female martial artist... ...in Chinese cinema is Chin Tsi-ang. In the 1930s, she formed a film company... ...where she starred in and produced many martial arts films. Chin Tsi-ang's eldest grandson is one of today's innovators: Sammo Hung. The martial arts film trend started with the huge success of... ...Burning of Red Lotus Monastery in 1928, in Shanghai. Strong stories married with notable action... ...has been the basis of the best martial arts films. The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple established that tradition. The film was so popular, it spawned a series of 27 movies. Sadly, not one of those films exists anymore. Fortunately, we did find several movies from the silent period. None of these early films have ever been seen outside of Asia before. Fantasy and magic are powerful elements in Chinese culture... ...and were a big part of the florid Peking Opera-style of storytelling. These enchanting components were utilized in early filmmaking. As visually fantastic as these stories seem... ...they invariably had deep meaning for their audiences. Many were based on history, spiritual concepts, legends and novels. The techniques might seem a little crude by today's standards... ...but look closely and you'll notice they're still being incorporated... ...into today's films. With the introduction of talking movies, a law was passed... ...that all films were to be shot in Mandarin, the predominant dialect. So many Cantonese-speaking filmmakers to flee from China... ...to Hong Kong, where restrictions were fewer... ...and many more movies were shot. With the outbreak of World War II and the occupation of Hong Kong... ...film production stopped. It wasn't until the dusts of war and revolution settled... ...that one of the most beloved folk heroes in China... ...rescued the martial arts film industry. Everyone knows Wong Fei Hung. - Wong Fei Hung. - Wong Fei Hung. Wong Fei Hung represents a kind of... ...very honest and upright sense of justice. He eliminates the bullies. And helps the downtrodden anytime, anywhere. He helps others, and he never gives in to evil forces. He also has a very kind and sympathetic heart. Not only does he use his medical skills to save and heal people... ...but at the same time, he's also a very patriotic hero. Wong Fei Hung was a martial arts master. His fighting style appealed to the film's director, Wu Pang. Wu Pang hired martial artists instead of Peking Opera choreographers. One of them was Master Lau Kar Leung. I learned Hung Gar, or Hung-style boxing. My master, who is my father, is Lau Jham. And my father's master was Lam Sai Wing. Who was Lam Sai Wing's master? Everyone knows it's Wong Fei Hung. Who is Wong Fei Hung's master? Luk Nga Choi. Who was Luk Nga Choi's master? Monk Zhi Shan. He was Southern Shaolin. When Wong Fei Hung started filming... ...then of course I was useful, because I fought the martial art. In the beginning, we really fought with real kung fu. That's how we shot Wong Fei Hung. The actor who originally played Wong Fei Hung was Kwan Tak Hing. Let's first talk about Kwan Tak Hing. He was in opera, Cantonese opera. When they were casting... ...they liked Kwan Tak Hing's body language, his height. It resembled the real Wong Fei Hung. And because he was not familiar with Hung-style kung fu... ...my master and their brothers had to teach him. Kwan Tak Hing was very intelligent. After all, he was an opera actor. The spell Wong Fei Hung held over Chinese audiences then... ...is still powerful today. His magic has worked wonders for the careers of two of today's stars: Jackie Chan in a comedy, and Jet Li in a drama. Kwan Tak Hing made approximately 90 Wong Fei Hung movies. He became so identified with Wong Fei Hung... ...that Kwan Tak Hing himself became a living legend. When he retired, he became a healer and taught martial arts. Though Kwan Tak Hing's Wong Fei Hung films were popular... ...women were still the real stars throughout the 1950s. In my first movie... ...it's not a woman in the movie. In the movie, I'm a man, a guy. At that time, maybe early in the stage, acting was very low. The man in the family, they'd rather the wife... To watch a lady do it. The female stars of that period were Pei Pei Cheng... ... Josephine Siao... ...Suet Nei... ...and Chan Po Chu. Every one of them regularly portrayed a man in a film. Asian attitudes toward movies had not changed since the 1920s. The 1950s and early 1960s had two major film companies. One came to be known as the Cathay Film Company. The other was... ...the Shaw Brothers. In the 1950s, the Shaw Brothers built a huge, secluded... ...and totally self-contained studio on Clearwater Bay, Hong Kong. It was a city unto itself where everyone worked, lived and slept. Set painters, directors, actors, prop masters, cameramen. Anyone who had anything to do with making a film... ...lived on the studio lot, miles from anywhere. In the early 1950s, Raymond Chow joined Shaw Brothers... ...and is credited, with owner Run Run Shaw... ...with improving production and story standards. Under Chow, Shaw Brothers continued with the swordplay stories. However, he and his directors were taking note of Japanese filmmakers... ...particularly Akira Kurosawa. I think Shaw Brother has deliberate attempt... ...to copy samurai movies. Because I think back then, it's big moneymakers in Asia. They're very influential. Some of them get into artistic levels, such as Kurosawa's. I think the Japanese, at that period in history... ...were very, very realistic in their depiction of what happens... ...in terms of a battle, a sword fight. Akira Kurosawa was a great humanitarian. His themes were counter to the nationalistic fervour of the time. He was one brave man. All of the great Kurosawa classics were... ...brilliant personification of not only filmmaking... ...but the philosophies and the spiritual aspects of the martial arts. The Shaw Brothers management screened Kurosawa's... ...and other Japanese films for its producers, writers and directors. The message was powerful drama and realistic action was possible. Three Shaw Brothers directors, King Hu, Chang Che and Lau Kar Leung... ...were particularly influenced. This trio would change the face of martial arts films... ...and in very different ways. King Hu and Chang Che are of tremendous influence... ...to the martial arts films of the era. Almost everyone is imitating them. He is, I think, very, very important people... ...for the Hong Kong martial art movie. He totally changed the style. It's a line there. Before that, martial art movie just Beijing Opera. Then, start from Come Drink With Me... ...the martial art movie, it's an action movie. So I think that's totally different. Make me very famous, that's right. This movie changed my whole life. Because after that, I do a lot of martial art movies. Even Crouching Tiger. I'm still in martial art, right? So it changed my whole life. Most obviously, of course, King Hu, I think he sets tone for many things. The use of negative space due to Chinese watercolour paintings. I think that's a lot of his background. And also Peking Opera influences. Most of his films, at least the best ones... ...are about the warm-up... ...paragraphs in a nice program, Peking Opera performing. Hero characters, bad characters, they come to one milieu. Good guys win, something happens. But the rhythm, the performing art... ...the music aspect of it, the choreography, the poses... ...the rhythm: And all those rhythms. Along with some, I guess... ...Hitchcockian or Eisenstein influences. In addition to the beauty of the movement... ...there was also a very strong element of suspense. So his films and Chang Che's are very different... ...because King Hu emphasized the romance between men and women... ...whereas Chang Che's films placed greater importance... ...on the righteousness and bonds between men. Che was inspired by Kurosawa's realism and masculine approach. In Chang Che's movies, women don't mean a thing. They're a drag, at the best. At the best. Most of the time you don't see them. I don't think he cared for women. He enjoyed the beauty of men. In those days, most of the leading stars were ladies. One Armed Swordsman was one of the first pictures... ...that emphasized on the male lead. One Armed Swordsman. That is the one that really blew me away. And for me... ...it means a lot because I had polio when I was, like, a baby. So I sort of considered myself a little bit inadequate... ...not as normal as anybody. And when I watched that movie, it sort of, like... ...give me an electric jolt, you know, like, "You can do it." The guy with one arm can even fight the best martial artists in the world. And that has a lot of great impression, that movie... ...when I was growing up. To make use of the fact that other people's perceived perception... ...of his weakness or his inability is his strength... ...that is a concept of-- That's a true adaptation of the philosophy of martial arts. The 1967 film One Armed Swordsman was a movie very much of its time. The youth in Hong Kong was finding its voice... ...rebelling against the status quo, and Chang Che realized that. For him, that was what this film was about. Master, I no longer believe in your ways. I have my own path to go. He was saying, "Don't let your youth be a weakness. Understand and train it to become your strength." He acknowledged that this was his version of the American classic... ...Rebel Without a Cause. One Armed Swordsman was one of 100 movies Chang Che directed... ...many of which became classics. And it wasn't just his marriage of bloody realism... ...and intellectual insights that made him revered... ...but also his stylised way of shooting and editing. He was influenced by Arthur Penn's 1967 seminal gangster movie... ...Bonnie and Clyde and its use of slow motion. I imitate a lot of things of Chang Che. When I had the chance in 1973 to shoot my first film, Young Dragons... ...there are many shadows of Chang Che in it. The kind of spirit of the male lead character in my film... ...his sense of justice, of passion and righteousness... ...are very close to Chang Che's. Chang Che's films emphasized the so-called righteous and just spirit. And it made me idolize him very much. The third important director from the Shaw Brothers is Lau Kar Leung. He's a true martial arts master whose training lineage... ...can be traced all the way back to Monk Zhi Shan. Monk Zhi Shan was the master... ...who, after the second Shaolin Temple was burned down... ...taught martial arts to the Peking Opera in the first place. It has been Lau Kar Leung's life's work... ...to bring real martial arts to the big screen. With him, we have come full circle to the main traditions of these films: Peking Opera and the Shaolin Temple. At that time, no one had or would shoot a film about monks. They shot martial arts hero films with handsome guys and great heroes. Why would anyone use a new actor, Gordon Liu, to play a bald monk? No matter how you fight, it's useless. Monk films have no romance. Martial arts hero films have romantic elements. The producer and the director, Lau Kar Leung, argued over this: "How can it be without a love story?" But monks can't have a love story. So, what do we finally shoot? The story of the spirit and the perseverance of the monks. We finally finished The 36 Chambers of Shaolin. Now 36 Chambers of Shaolin, I wanted to show kung fu. What is kung fu? Kung fu does not rely on fighting. Many things have to do with awareness. Your eyes, your ears to listen, and all kinds of weapons. Everyone must train in all these chambers: Chamber of blades, of kicks, chamber of eyes, chamber of ears. They must train in each chamber. So I came up with the idea, the human body... ...each part that moves has feeling of motion. Every part has this feeling. Feeling of motion. It has its own kind of charisma. So I decided to show it in The 36 Chambers. Human kung fu cannot be attained by sitting there and moving one part. The whole body must move. For other directors it may be difficult... ...but for Lau Kar Leung, it was not... ...because he is known as the "Dictionary of Kung Fu." In my understanding, I feel that the so-called real martial arts... ...is not to teach people how to kill others... ...or to beat up people. Real martial arts is a kind of discipline for the heart and passions. It is how to train yourself to become a virtuous... ...just and righteous man. Though martial arts films were popular in Asia... ...they had not penetrated the world market. In 1970, two events occurred that would change the martial arts genre: First, producer Raymond Chow left Shaw Brothers... ...and with Leonard Ho, formed their own company, Golden Harvest. I think in the late '60s... ...television was beginning... ...to become popular in the United States. I think the management of Shaw Brothers... ...felt that the same effect may hit Hong Kong... ...and was thinking of cutting down the operation... ...and using half of the manpower... ...to go into-- And capital-- To go into television. I didn't quite agree with that. We left in 1970, and we made-- First year, I think we made four or five pictures. Four pictures already. The other main event of 1970 was a guy named... Bruce Lee. There's some things up to this day... ...nobody do better than he does. The spirit of fighting. The charismatic, the stark kind of attraction that comes along... ...not only with his performances, but his philosophy in fighting... ...and deal with life. That was very straightforward, very Westernised... ...very gung-ho, can-do spirit... ...than the repressed Chinese zigzagging kind of attitude. Bruce Lee, who would have such an impact on martial arts films... ...was actually born and raised in San Francisco. Bruce was an actor before he was a martial artist. He did his first commercial when he was 5. He didn't start studying kung fu until he was 10. And his father was an opera singer. And, I mean... That guy, he's a show-biz guy. The first martial arts film-- Television actually... ...was Bruce Lee's Green Hornet. One day I was watching this obviously Asian guy... ...with a mask on, jumping up and doing flying kicks. Green Hornet was a successful series... ...but the U.S. wasn't ready for Lee to become a leading man. I admire Bruce Lee. I remember in one interview when he was saying... ...the Kung Fu TV series is supposed to be written for him... ...and because he's Asian, you know, Chinese face... ...and back then American television, they don't believe... ...they would like to see an Asian hero. Bruce Lee left the United States and headed back to Hong Kong. When Bruce first joined us... ...the first picture we had him make was done in Bangkok. And after the first day's work... ...the director called and said: "I want to change Bruce Lee because he can't fight." I said, "Why?" He said, "Everybody knows... ...that we're now calling him 'Lee Three Kicks'... ...because he can kick only three times." So I flew to Bangkok, looked at the situation... ...and asked Bruce what happened. Bruce said, "This director is useless because these guys are just soldiers. Very low-down soldiers who can't really fight. If I have to spend five minutes dealing with them... ...what am I going to do when I meet the real, good martial artists?" "And besides," he said, "the way I kick these three kicks... ...is so strong, they should be out completely." So I look at the film, and I agree with him. And we just quietly change the director. And really, the rest is history. He has an effect on each of us who are Chinese and in this industry. His ethnic identity is very strong, and it makes everyone excited. He stands out and is proud of being a Chinese. His sense of identity, of being a Chinese, is really strong. I think Bruce... He was much more than just a martial artist. And he was much more than a martial arts actor or superstar. The philosophy that he had, the things that he wrote... ...The Tao of Jeet Kun Do... ...the ideas that he had were so far and ahead of his time. I said, "Empty your mind. Be formless. Shapeless, like water." Now, you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend. His most special quality is that he had his own character. He allowed his character and acting to be different from others. His confidence is high. He combined Chinese and Western styles. His style is not purely Chinese... ...but he included the Westernised ingredients... ...in expressing his loyalty to his country and race. Watching him is not only seeing an actor... ...but more and very special. Styles tend to not only separate men... ...because they have their own doctrines... ...and then the doctrine became the gospel truth that you cannot change. But if you do not have style, if you just say: "Well, here I am as a human being... ...how can I express myself totally and completely?" Now, that way, you won't create a style... ...because style is a crystallization. That way, it's a process of continuing growth. When you do punch-- I'm leaning forward a little... ...hoping not to hurt any camera angle. You gotta put the whole hip into it... ...and snap it and get all your energy in there... ...and make this into a weapon. I never see anybody do change of rhythm in a fight so well as him... ...even up to these days. And it's choreographed: And nobody fights like that. But his fight looks more powerful and real... ...and more spiritual because... ...every punch, every block, every change of rhythm... ...even eye shifting, means something. And that's very intriguing. It's great entertainment and inspiring. He always looked forward. Those movements were so tremendous... ...on set, they made sounds. The winds from his fists scare you. I went to see Enter the Dragon... ...and came back and said to Jerry Thorpe: "Have you seen this?" He said, "No." I said, "You haven't? You gotta see this." I decided to make it mandatory that everyone on the crew see the movie. He said, "We're up against the James Bond... ...of martial arts, you know." I said, "No, we're up against the James Dean of martial arts." Big difference. To me, okay, to me... ...ultimately, martial art means honestly expressing yourself. Now, it is very difficult to do. I mean, it is easy for me to put on a show and be cocky... ...and be flooded with a cocky feeling and then feel pretty cool and all that. I can make all kinds of phoney things, you see what I mean? Blinded by it. Or I can show you some really fancy movement. But to express oneself honestly, not lying to oneself... ...and to express myself honestly, now that is very hard to do. Audiences often wonder why most martial arts films... ...were period pieces set long ago. Bruce Lee had a simple answer. Nowadays, you don't go around kicking people or punching people. Because if you do, that's it. I don't care how good you are. In spite of this belief, Bruce Lee was one of the first... ...to portray martial arts in a contemporary setting. In 1973, at the age of 32... ...Bruce Lee tragically died from a brain edema. He had only completed four movies, but they would open the world... ...to the martial arts genre. Almost as soon as the world got to appreciate him... ...he passed away. Over 20,000 fans showed up for his funeral. People still love Bruce Lee. He makes this keep on. His spirit is still there. The movie still keeps on showing. So many things still impress us. He's the only kung fu master, I think... ...in our Chinese show business. Not because he's a real kung fu martial artist. He can make the kung fu become a kind of kung fu plus ballet. Plus a kind of soul. To some, something to explain... ...that he's a spirit that can show on pictures. Lee's death created a vacuum unprecedented in martial arts films. Suddenly, the future was looking bleak for the genre. Fortunately, in 1973, a U.S. television series... ...helped keep martial arts alive and popular around the world. Ironically, it was the series that Bruce Lee had hoped to star in. Learn this, Grasshopper. The mind of every creature... ...is the master of his own body. But only if the mind flows with nature may that mastery be fully exercised. There is no limit to the wondrous powers of the body... ...nor is there a limit to the ways one may harness those powers... ...to the mastery of the harmonious mind. It may take half a lifetime to master one system. - What do you hear? - I hear the water. I hear the birds. Do you hear the grasshopper which is at your feet? Old man, how is it that you hear these things? Young man, how is it that you do not? As a kid, I'd try to grab the grasshopper and replicate Kung Fu. No one will die today. You wish to save this worthless devil? A Shaolin. A coward. A peasant who carries vegetables. An old woman who runs from shadows. That was always a fantasy. Here was a guy... ...interested in righteousness... ...representing the common and little man. But when called upon, he could step up... ...and kick ass, fight for righteousness. I always found that very magical. Go. I feel sort of privileged to have managed to fall into-- I may be the only martial arts star... ...who came to it from the point of view of an actor. Many roads often lead to the same place. Many roads lead to places no one wishes to go. You're up to something. It is said that a moth that lives too close to the flame leads a short life. But in China, it is said... ...there is little difference between a long and short life. Both are but moments in time. The people who make martial arts movies are martial artists... ...who have devoted their lives to martial arts and then given it up... ...to try to be actors kind of late in life. And I'm a born and bred actor. It wasn't about revenge. It wasn't about crime. It was about philosophy. And it was historical. Enough! I felt like that. When I first started doing it... ...and through the series, I felt like, "I'm getting to say things... ...you just don't get to say in movies." After Bruce Lee died, the whole movie industry going down. Bruce Lee is the best. Some other action movie, nobody's gonna see it. And at that time, I was quite disappointed. The martial arts genre needed a breakthrough... ...and in the late 1970s got the shot in the arm it required... ...from its old friend: Peking Opera and comedy. In the theatre, there is a troupe where we all performed. For example, Jackie Chan... ...Sammo Hung, Yuen Biao and all of us lived together... ...and we learned Peking Opera. We all became stuntmen. Actually, it was really Sammo. Sammo Hung was the first to get started. Then it was Jackie Chan. Then me, then Yuen Biao. Sammo Hung got out of school three years ahead of us. When we learned opera, he was the first to enter the school... ...and was considered our eldest martial arts brother. So he had to start looking out for us then. If he did not look out for us, he would not be given food... ...so he had to look out for us. Painted Faces is an autobiographical movie... ...of Jackie, Corey, Yuen Biao and Sammo's lives... ...in the opera school. Audiences who see it think it's harsh. For us, who lived through it, it doesn't show all that went on. For us, it doesn't tell the truth adequately. Since the audience considered it bad enough... ...if we added more into it, the actual experiences... ...the audiences would never accept the truth. It was decided to romanticize the experience and show... ...some of our training. I still think it's a pretty good movie. Sammo Hung, Corey Yuen and Yuen Biao each have successful careers... ...but Jackie Chan would be the one to be embraced by the world. It wasn't an easy road. Producers tried to make Jackie into Bruce Lee. All those films failed. Jackie is quite different. I'd say entirely different from Bruce. I think it's very wise of him to take that route. Jackie relies more on comedy... ...to increase the attraction... ...of his martial arts. Jackie's breakthrough movie utilized his strengths: His comedy and imagination. A snake mouth. I make the reason why you have to, like this. Okay. You just block somebody arms. Okay, that's a snake mouth. And when you turn around, that's a snake tongue: Then I go home. I look at a mirror. I just like this: When everybody's asleep, I practise. It looked good for the movie. That's a new style. It's not like: It's like coming: Do some comedy, you know: These kinds of things. Everybody: Jackie followed Snake in the Eagle's Shadow with Drunken Master. This made him Asia's number one star. Each temple, one Buddha. Each master, his own technique. Jackie acknowledges his influences are the early American silent stars... ...Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd. Older movies, Chinese movies, every movie-- When you see the double, you can tell. Everybody do: Like this. When you look at a Jackie Chan movie, when I'm doing the stunts... ...that's me. I hate violence. Yes, I do. It's a kind of a dilemma. Every time I saw him perform, I would copy moves. I would remember what he did and try them. He was my inspiration. People recognize that it's not CG. It's not created in a computer. That's just someone who's worked and studied for a long time... ...and can pull it off in front of the cameras. Jackie Chan has been the top martial arts actor for nearly 30 years. In the last few years, he has arguably become... ...the number one box-office star in the world in any genre. Here's Jackie. Everybody have a dream. I have a dream. I hope one day, my name and footprints on this star row. - Jackie's my hero. - Jackie Chan, he's a great man. - Hey, buddy. You bet. - Thank you. He's got a sense of humour, which is good. You see a wonderful actor. It's just innocence and charm. And suddenly, this wonderful physical activity going on. How many people can do that? Almost simultaneously to the needed comedy boost... ...Hong Kong created its own film festival. This encouraged new talent to become more experimental. A new wave of filmmakers emerged... ...led by the likes of Tsui Hark... ... John Woo, Yuen Woo Ping, Jet Li, Corey Yuen... - ...and Jackie Chan. - You have to watch me. In Asia, writer, director and producer Tsui Hark... ...is often mentioned in the same class as directors Steven Spielberg... ...and Alfred Hitchcock. Born in Vietnam... ...he found his way to Texas to learn American filmmaking. One of his favourite movies is the classic Citizen Kane. In 1977, Tsui returned to Hong Kong and began a prolific career. His early work Zu: Warriors From the Magic Mountain... ...was the first major special effects movie made in Hong Kong. Tsui doesn't like to wrap for the day. He's mad. His passion scared us. This is a good director, but his crew will find their work... ...to be rather physically straining. He's very creative. He was never just happy to do the usual thing. He was always figuring out a new way to do things... ...in a more innovative fashion. In 1984, Tsui formed his production company, Film Workshop... ...and experimented with historic dramas, horror, swordplay movies... ...fantasy, science fiction, comedy and romance. There's not a style Tsui hasn't attempted... ...a camera angle he hasn't tried... ...and a technology he hasn't sampled. He is truly a forerunner of the MTV generation. But his films are not style over substance. He invited writers and directors to work by stating simple goals: "Develop your own style. There must be a point to your story. It must make the audience feel better. We'll become one with the audience. They go to the movies to feel... ...not to understand." Tsui Hark is the modernizer of both the kung fu and swordplay subgenre. Kung fu, everybody knows his Once Upon a Time in China series. The star of Once Upon a Time in China, Jet Li... ...was a martial arts champion. His career has exploded internationally. Tsui Hark collaborated with the new talent... ...as a producer, director or writer. Amongst them is director... ...and one of the great contemporary choreographers, Yuen Woo Ping. Every 10 years, when martial art films... ...the energy, the genre begins to die down... ...he did something that will blossom the genre for another 10 years. People will copy him for years. Yuen Woo Ping was one of the pioneers. One of his specialties is acrobatic movements. In Snake in the Eagle's Shadow, some of his early work, Drunken Master... ...there were acrobatic elements. Playing with a stool, playing with a chopstick. Because he grew up in that environment. He grew up learning from his father... ...who was a very influential martial arts choreographer. His father started off as Beijing Opera. So they all learned all their physical skill from Beijing Opera. Same as Jackie Chan and Sammo. He's an artist. He cares for those things, though he doesn't admit it. And I think with his experience... ...and talent and mastery in the art, he still has an open heart... ...like a child. That's why I love him so much. He inspired me, not only... ...in making martial arts scenes, but as a filmmaker in general. You know, what if Baryshnikov or Nureyev did a martial arts film? From choreographer Yuen Woo Ping to someone who moves his camera... ...like Woo Ping uses a body to highlight a moment. - He's the Woo man. - The Woo man... - He's the Woo. - ...is director John Woo. He's the man. So first of all, I really loved The Wizard of Oz. What impressed me the most was Judy Garland and her three friends. One was the Tin Man. One was the Lion. The Tin Man was actually very weak. And so I felt that he was similar to my personality. - Well, you're perfect now. - My neck. My neck. Perfect? Bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect. Go ahead, bang on it. Beautiful. What an echo. It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart. No heart? No heart. All hollow. I felt that I was him. I related to his character. And so later in the story, he became very strong. So he gave me a lot of encouragement. My favourite was the theme song of the film... ..."Over the Rainbow." "Over the Rainbow" gives me great emotional support. For me, it means at the rainbow's end... ...there is still a very beautiful world. People should not give up their hope. They should endlessly work hard... ...to find hope. And at that time when I was living in a difficult environment... ...it gave me great encouragement. Wizard of Oz to The Killer, Face/Off and Mission: Impossible II? Let's back up and see the evolution of John Woo... ...who has made martial arts films, comedies, a musical, action... ...and some of the bloodiest scenes ever shot. When I was about 5, my whole family moved from China to Hong Kong. And at that time, we were very poor. We lived at a squatter area, and we slept on the street. I lived in that poverty till I was 9. I never had the chance to go to elementary school. Later, we received help from the church and an American family. The American family sent money to the church for my education. At that time, I loved watching movies, and I entered the world of films. Besides opera films, I watched a lot of martial arts films... ...especially the Wong Fei Hung films. It was because I felt the place where I lived was just like hell... ...that life was very dark and grey and very hopeless... ...because I was living in a world full of evil and sins. In the cinemas and in the church... ...they were my only refuge. John Woo has never forgotten how transcendent the song... ..."Somewhere Over the Rainbow" was in his violent childhood. He used a version of the song in his film Face/Off. Don't be scared, all right? And so in my films... ...my characters sometimes are between good and evil. We've got something in common. We both know our guns. When I shoot gunfight films, I use the same feelings as a martial arts film. Only I use double guns in place of the sword. For example, the layout of my scenes... ...character design and those action designs... ...are all very close to Chang Che's martial arts film style. The heroes in my films shoot many times continuously... ...and people get hit continuously. That feeling has the Chang Che's martial arts film's shadow. With my hero... ...his stance as he holds the gun, and his views of the gun... ...is the same as the hero's in the martial arts film... ...but he holds a sword. How he uses his sword, and the way he sees his sword... ...the feeling is exactly the same. So my personality will forever stand on the side of justice. So I will always believe justice will win. In the 1980s, after nearly two decades out of the spotlight... ...women found themselves centre stage again. Because a woman's body... ...the beauty in movement is very beautiful. When I first shot Michelle Yeoh and Cynthia Rothrock... ...it started a new trend. When that film came out... ...I saw the fame of Michelle Yeoh and Cynthia Rothrock. A lot of women started to be in action films. People say, "You can wear lipstick when you do martial arts?" Of course you can. Kung fu. Kung fu is something I have to use when I shoot films. Kung fu is my tool with which I make a living. Kung fu... ...is what destroyed my health. Okay? And so to me, kung fu is a love-hate thing. I can't be without it. But with it, I feel I hurt myself very much. But when you don't use it, you won't be doing your best. So I do love it, yes. But in my personal life... ...I would not be in contact with it. Very contradictory. With many successful contemporary films in the '70s and '80s... ...it was a surprise to the world to see a resurgence of period films. Hong Kong, however, was not mystified. There was great political uncertainty as the British government... ...prepared to hand back the province to mainland China in 1997. Audiences embraced... ...and seemed to want to be reminded of a familiar and rich history... ...full of heroes that might lead them through this transitional period. With the renewed interest in period stories, it seemed... ...contemporary films would fall into a cyclical slump. But that hasn't happened. It seems as if martial arts in movies has matured beyond simple trends... ...and has become fully accepted as a genre... ...allowing all kinds of stories to be produced. From high action... ...to science fiction... ...to comedy... ...romance... ...and period. This is proven with the huge success of films like The Matrix... ...Rush Hour 2... ...and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Finally, Shaolin Temple and Peking Opera-influenced styles... ...live side by side. The pinnacle of the world's respect for martial arts films... ...is highlighted by the awards, accolades and success... ...of Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. All of the best qualities have been captured: Spiritual, mythical, dramatic, romantic... ...beautiful photography and choreography, and fantastic action. I was surprised, of course. A decade ago I would never expect... ...a Chinese-language martial art epic... ...to be mainstream and win an Oscar. There's no shortage of heroines in the movie... ...but I suspect that is society's fantasy... ...to see heroic women fight. It's something to watch... ...to admire. This Chow Yun Fat character is giving this young prodigy... ...who happens to be so attractive-looking... ...some lessons on bamboo top. What do you think I'm after? I think Ang Lee is a genius... ...in the way that he sort of, like... Find a very authentic Chinese period story. Period. I mean, it's not contemporary, right? They all dress funny, right? But then, the subject matter... ...of the character inside the story... ...are telling a very contemporary story. You know? The situation with the girl, the young girl. It's just like nowadays teenagers. Very rebellious against tradition, like, free spirit... ...looking for identity, you know, trying to break through. And then you have... ...this forbidden love between Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh. They love each other because they're bound by the tradition. I want to interrupt you. I will say... ...I'm sort of a hopeless romantic also. And the martial arts in its true sense is a fairly, sort of... ...solitude path. I think there's some dialogue when Chow Yun Fat is dying... ...and he looks up to Michelle Yeoh... ...and he's had trouble all his life telling this woman he loves her... ...which has been another problem I've had. I'm not very good at that either. The martial arts are also the essence of love... ...and the nurturing, motherly protection of love... ...that love should have. The filmmaker that directed and made it, Ang Lee... ...brought a sensitivity in the story and the way he shot it. The most memorable thing for me is when Chow Yun Fat... ...and Michelle Yeoh are talking... ...in this cement building... ...and in the backdrop of this huge window it's a beautiful scenery... ...of mainland China in the backdrop, and you realize that. And the confinement they're in, they can't consummate their relationship. Just outside is the beauty of nature. Everything is available to them... ...but yet they can't go beyond, they're closed in. I thought, "Wow." That's a real filmmaker and storyteller's sensibility. The first question he asked me is, "Do you mind being a bad guy?" I've never been a bad guy. That's my first time. But of course, not the last time though. Because I think maybe in person I'm very kind... ...very sweet. So nobody thinks I could be a bad guy. But he's the first one. I said, "It's okay. I don't mind. As long as you think I can do it, then I can do it." The ending, when the girl flies down... ...I thought, "I want to make a movie that's targeted toward that image." Many of these martial arts pioneers and innovators... ...have acknowledged the influence of American films on their styles... ...from the tender Wizard of Oz to the bloody Bonnie and Clyde. But elements of martial arts have appeared in American films... ...that were definitely not martial arts stories. Sinatra strutted his stuff seriously in the Manchurian Candidate. Peter Sellers highlighted his techniques in the Pink Panther films. And it continues on... ...to current successes like Charlie's Angels. And even the animation favourite Shrek. After Bruce Lee's influence in the '70s... ...Hollywood embraced martial arts as a central story component. And it continues today. Buddha. In the hearts of these innovators who have fought... ...to make martial arts films a success... ...what does this achievement mean? That just shows you the world's getting closer... ...more open-minded. America is getting more open-minded. They're open enough to accept good things if the thing is good. If the product is good, it doesn't matter what languages, what culture. Well, it means that there is... ...some serious audience out there who wants to see martial arts films. I hope to see more Chinese films with a traditional martial arts spirit... ...that sense of righteousness, to make it shine in a very realistic way. Just like Bruce Lee. Everyone knows Bruce Lee. Not everyone appreciates martial arts, they appreciated Bruce only. Now people are starting to appreciate martial arts. It's all about timing. I cannot predict where it goes. But this is a genre that never dies, at least for the Chinese. It's always go up and down. But when you say it's dying, somebody figure a way to do it... ...and do something new and exciting. It will get hot again. Wu xia, that Chinese term I mentioned at the beginning? Wu means martial arts, which signifies action... ...xia conveys chivalry. Say it gently: And it's a breath of serenity embracing you. Say it with force: And you can feel its power. Such is the dichotomy of martial arts films... ...a genre born in a bloody rebellion and continues on today... ...with its own spiritual and creative revolution. A lot of martial arts' first principles... ...is how to discipline our heart and passions... ...and to train our own virtue. To me it's a dance. Because I'm a dancer. I think martial art is-- I keep saying-- Martial art is not just two guys fighting each other. Martial arts itself... ...I think is more spiritual than anything. Real martial arts is a kind of discipline for the heart and passions. It is how to train yourself to become a virtuous... ...just and righteous man. To me, martial art is about interpreting yourself... ...in the most devoted, the most honest way. To me, martial art is an expression. The most important thing is to be loyal. Failure is unimportant. If you fail, you should think about whether you worked hard. Be loyal, stay loyal. If in the future they don't like my films... ...I would just be another actor then. I am faithful to this art. That is a real deep question. They just go and kick ass. What I find most interesting is the emotional component... ...the discipline that is part and parcel of something... ...that, to the untrained American mind or whoever... ...you think it's just physical, but it's very emotional. It's very focused. It's very cerebral. To me, okay, to me... ...ultimately, martial art means honestly expressing yourself. Now, it is very difficult to do. Subtitles by SDI Media Group
