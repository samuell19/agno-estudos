The Little Gangster There you are. I want a word with you. - What's up? - What do you think? Look at this. - What's this? - I've never seen it before. A gun! What's it doing here? Whose is it? I haven't a clue. - It was in the wardrobe. - It's not mine. It's Daniel's. He's crazy bringing that home. A gun! What does he need a gun for? What if he shoots someone? Where is he anyway? Out with friends. - What shall we do? - I don't know, but stop yelling! - If I go to the cops... - It's not mine. - Promise? - I swear I've never seen it. It didn't get here by itself. - You've never seen it? - No. I suppose I'm doing your head in! This is no way to live! Don't call the cops. Put it back where you found it, and don't work Daniel up. If not, one day, bang... You're a goner. At least I wouldn't worry about you two anymore. It's nothing to do with me. That's what you say, but can I believe you? Take my word for it. Nobody tells me anything. Should I go to the cops? Just put it back where you found it. Don't say anything to Daniel. You haven't seen it. I haven't seen it... It's as if you have an agreement. I'm fed up! So fed up! Can you get me a beer? I don't talk to you when you drink. You know that. Don't you think you've had enough? And don't tell me it's your tablets! If I wasn't such a coward, I'd have done myself in by now. Don't try that again just to get our attention! Thanks, you're so kind! I am your mother! But you never go through with it. Luckily, you're too cowardly. You getting that, mum? - Hello? - Can I speak to Mrs Turot? She's sleeping. I don't want to wake her. I'll give her a message. Who's calling? I'm her daughter. She's only one daughter, that's Stephanie. You must have a wrong number. - Who are you? - Her son. You must be Marc then. Can you take my number, tell her to call me? - You got a pen? - No, but I'll remember. - This isn't a joke? - Not at all. So, my number's 67... 34... 70... 00. Okay. Tell her to call me, okay? Big kiss. What was my sister called, who died when I was a baby? - You never talk about her. - It's too difficult. Where's she buried? She's family. Tell me where she's buried. She's not with grandad. If she's dead, then you won't want her number? You going to tell me about my sister, or what? You going to go to school, get your diploma, or what? That's right, change the subject! Thank you. - Thank you. - Goodbye. How much is it? - 500 francs, now! - I don't have it. 500 francs or I'll shoot! I can't take it from the till. I'm not joking. - I have 200... - I said 500! I'll be fired if I take it from the till. So what? Watch it, I might do something stupid. - But I don't have it. - Dip in the till. Sod your boss! Hurry up or I'll blow your brains out! How much is the shampoo? 30 francs. I'll pay for it, but you give me 300 francs. Stop crying. Hurry up before anyone comes in. That's enough... 300 francs. Come on! All that for 500 francs! Thanks, goodbye. - Were you taken in? - I was just walking past. Talkative, aren't you? I'm not just a cop. It's not that... No school today? Yes, but my mum needed shampoo and a teacher's ill. Really? You think I'm stupid? What are you doing round here this early? You onto some car radios? I don't do that anymore, especially not in broad daylight. And I'd have a long coat or a bag. I've stopped all that. That's good to hear, if it's true. I couldn't resist coming back. I prefer talking to you than to some of my colleagues. I didn't recognize you, you're walking differently. I've an insole in one shoe. The doctor saw I've one leg shorter than the other. It hurt and it was difficult to run. I'll drive you to school. I'd rather know you're at school, than hanging around in the streets. Come on, get in. I don't like the way you're looking at me. As if you're gonna bite my head off. I'm not your property. You've no rights over me. You look at me as if you can do what you want. - What's up? - Nothing. I'm alright. - You've been skipping school long? - Two weeks. What were you up to earlier? Just hanging around. - Empty your pockets. - Why? I don't deal coke, weed or anything else. I believe you, but empty your pockets anyway. I'm coming round, you get out when I tell you to. And I'll frisk you. Close the door or I'll shoot! Change sides! Shut the door. I don't want to kill you, so watch it! Calm down. Calm down. I'm on your side. - You've got handcuffs? - Yeah, they're just... - Where? - In the glove compartment. Put them on. - Can we talk? - After. - I want to see my sister. - Where does she live? I've no idea. Is that a real gun? There aren't many around. I don't want to be held up with a toy gun. This is really serious. Why don't we call your judge? He's a good bloke. - The handcuffs! - You listening? Put them on! - I can't drive cuffed. - Fasten them to the wheel. I don't like threats. Tell me what's happened. Guns aren't usually your thing, so what's happened? Put the cuffs on! You're scaring me to death, so calm down and talk to me. - Put the cuffs on. - No! I said put them on! Put them on! You've gone crazy. Completely crazy. The keys... Here. The keys to the handcuffs... There. Put your gun away! Do it! You point a gun and kidnap me. What do you have for brains? Couscous? Why don't we go to the police station? Does a gun make you feel good? Like a gangster? - I'm no gangster! - You fire at cops! You hassled me. I'm paid to hassle thugs. I'm not a thug. What have you got yourself in? I can try to help. I'll come to the station, but I want to see my sister first. - What do you want with her? - Just to see her. - What's she done? - Nothing, I don't know her. Listen... We'll go and see your sister. But first... ...give me the gun. If not, I can't do this. - Once I've seen my sister. - No deal. I don't trust you. I want to see her. - Once I've seen my sister. - No deal. I don't trust you. I want to see her. Okay, listen... We'll go and see your sister... that nobody knows. Then we go to the station. Can I trust you? Yes. - I can't drive like that. - Of course you can. Where does she live? I only have her number. - We'll call from a phone box. - Okay, but not in town. You don't like it, tough. Enough talking. I haven't touched your gun, just the window. You're the one who's talking. I'll do what you want. Will that one do? There'll always be people around. What's up? Don't you want to call? I want you to call her. I don't know her. I'll call, but I need to know what's going on. If she's your sister, you must know her. Has it been a long time? My mum lied to me. I had a big sister. My dad must have taken her, or my mum put her in care. She told me about a baby that died, not a big sister. That sister called yesterday, to talk to my mum. My mum was out of it, so I took a message. She said she was my sister and had found my mum's address. My mum said it wasn't true. I could tell she was lying. You don't lie to you kids. Especially to your son about his big sister. That's why I want to see her. Couldn't you do it without acting a fool? Did you pinch money earlier? Someone lent me some, I'll have to pay it back. I can't see you borrowing money. I'll pay it back. And now, I want to see her. You got the number? I won't go to the cops before. You try anything, I'll shoot myself. It's not hard. Listen, I don't like your threats. We'll see your sister then you come with me, okay? I was just warning you. And shut up about the gun. I'm not handing it over. I'll call you back. She lives in Montpellier. - Did she tell you that? - No, some guy. - She wasn't there? - She's at work. She must be a waitress. You made another call. You called the cops, so why the long face? I can't go to Montpellier. It's out of my jurisdiction. I'm not authorized. I was right earlier... You're always trying to trick me. Now the cops are after us. Let's go. I'll call back in ten minutes for authorization. They're calling the prosecutor and your judge. I said I believed you would keep your word. I'm on your side. I bet you've given them her address. I don't have it, but her number's up here. I don't need you to get to Montpellier. And no cops. You've been warned. It's 44 rue Jean Mermoz. You can't just turn up like that. With all this, the cops will be waiting for you. They'll get her out of there to protect her. They know you've got a gun. They won't take any risks without me there. Let's get going and we'll call later. They trust us, so the cops won't be waiting. Come on, don't make things even worse. - I prefer you with the cuffs on. - I don't. Tough. Put them on. Why don't we meet your sister at work? I don't know where she works, probably in a café. We've been a family of waiters for generations. I'm taking my waiter's diploma. I wanted to work in computing, but I thought it'd be too hard. Too much to learn: typing, the technical terms, and all that. So I decided to follow the family tradition. She must be a waitress. Montpellier's a big town, we can't search all the cafés. Make that call. It's been 15 minutes. They trust us... they trust you. I told you. I've got butterflies. You should be glad. It hasn't all been for nothing. You can't back down now. I want to see her but I'm nervous. You'll manage it. If not, you're a jerk. Or we go to the station and then call her... I see you coming. We can't meet at the police station. She's just a girl. No, she's my sister. It's not the same. I can't believe I'm meeting her. Don't get so worked up. It'd be worse if I didn't see her now. But I'm scared stiff. You're scared, but you'll like her. Or course I will, she's my sister. Here we are. Those two cops in the car don't look like cops. They're not cops. - I can tell them to clear off. - Do that. Leave. He's spotted you. He's calmed down. We'll sort this out quietly. Give me your jacket so I can hide the gun. Give it a rest! You got what you wanted, there are no cops around, so give me the gun. Don't let her see it. I said I'd give it to you after seeing her. You're trying to trick me. I just want your jacket to go in. Forget it! It's not my style and she wouldn't like it. Keep your distance, stay in front. I'm not going to get near you. - You don't know your dad's name! - He left before telling me. You haven't the faintest idea? It's short and sounds French. - Guiton? - I never bothered before. Some don't have names on. I know. That helps a lot. You don't have the same name? I have my stepfather's name... The previous one. Maybe she has my father's name. She could have the guy's name you talked to. - Did you ask his name? - No. - We'll knock. - I don't know what she looks like. You're the one who wants to see her. You should've told me you didn't know her name. I could've got it from the guy on the phone. He said she'd be back in half an hour. That's about now. We don't know her name, which floor or what she looks like. - You find that funny? - Yes. She'd better turn up soon! What do you think a cop does? Why? - Someone who lays down the law. - Right. You think I'm doing my job? You're going to get me fired. Cops really have to mess up first. It's not your fault, it's like I've kidnapped you. You had no choice and they trust you. - You have kidnapped me. - Alright. But siblings should be allowed to know each other. Stop whinging. I'm going to be the one in trouble. Let's try and find her. We're better off waiting. We might miss her. We'll catch her on her way up. Any other siblings? Stephanie, my little sister. She's in care. I could only speak to her on the phone. I went to see her once. She opened the door. She didn't recognize me. I said, "Can I see Stephanie?" I'd recognized her. "It's me, Marc." She recognized me, gave me a big kiss. I was happy. It'd been 3 years. - It's her? - Must be, it's how I imagine her. I'm Mrs Turot's son. I'm looking for her daughter. What are you doing here? Come in. Who's that in the corridor? He's with me. We got your address through your number. - Why hasn't mum called? - I don't know. - You told her I called? - Yes. You told her? - So why hasn't she called? - I don't know. - Is he mum's new husband? - He doesn't know her. - Who is he then? - A cop. Why are you with a cop? I've been in some trouble, he came with me. What kind of trouble? I went stealing and he nabbed me. I pointed a gun at him. But I'm turning myself in after. What is this crap? I've never bothered you so why bring a cop here? - He helped find you. - More's the pity. Does your mum know? No, she kicked me out. She never told me about you. All this has happened since. I don't want to see you like this. Get out! - I wanted to see you. - You've seen me. Now clear off! Stay away! - Wait there. - I shouldn't have come with a cop. Wait there. I'll talk to your sister. You're all he's got. Are you completely stupid, or what? I'm not the one with a gun. This isn't my fault. He's going to do himself in! Just sod off! Slow down. Your sister's in the car. Try to understand her... You turn up with a gun and a cop! It's all been a bit of a shock to her. I get in the car, she gets out and you sort it out. Then we go to the station. I've nothing to say to her. - I'm not saying sorry. - Did I say that? I said try to understand. She's angry. She doesn't want to know me. That's all there is to it. We don't know each other, period. Stop right there. She'll come and talk to you. If she comes to you... She's in the car. I didn't make her get in. If she comes to you... Has all this been for nothing? I can wash my hands of it and call the cops. But we have an arrangement. She wants to see you now. After all you've done. Don't you like her? She's my sister! She could get out of the car. Okay, pal. She's coming. Go on. He's upset but he's not dangerous. - I can see that. - I'll sort the rest out later. He's alright, as cops go. He doesn't want to look like a fool. You're crazy to have brought him here. - You're like your dad. - Don't know him. Shame, he's alright. How's your mum? She's okay, but getting old fast. She can't hold her drink. Especially since grandad died. I'll go and see her soon. - You've lived here long? - No, and we're not staying. It's dad's flat, but he's gone off again. It's been three months now. You disappointed? I don't know you, and you yell at me. It's a good start, then things can only get better. Will you come back? Maybe. After the station. I've charges against me so it depends on my judge. And all this with the gun... Don't be daft. You've got to be 16 to go to jail. I bet they lock youngsters up. They might not call it jail. I don't want to be put away. - It'll be worse if you run off. - I don't want to go down. Try talking to him What have you done exactly? I took my stepdad's gun, and stole some money from a shop. I didn't want to go home, and they don't want me. I was skint. But I haven't spent it, I can pay it back. But then he nabbed me. He didn't see my gun, but he could tell I'd been up to no good. Then I made him bring me to see you. Let's go and talk to him. He'll stand up for you. No chance! Let's try talking to him. We'll get him to sort things out. I'll go and talk to him. But the gun's my stepdad's. It's not your fault. He shouldn't have one. Stay here. Wait for me, okay? - What's up now? - It's okay, he's calmed down. We were wondering if you could sort things out for him. He's scared to go home. I've done everything I can. It's time to go. That's enough tantrums. He said he'll go with you. But things would look better for him... if you said he didn't have a gun. Look at the window! He almost killed me. You want me to do a false report? Who do you think I am? That's enough. He didn't want to kill you. It was an accident. We'll clean it up, no one will be the wiser. I'll pay to change the glass. You can make things easier for him. Listen, he has a gun. He's "borrowed" money from a shopkeeper, pointed a gun at me and fired. This goes beyond me. He has a judge and he isn't 16 yet. I'm starting to think I'm the one with problems. I've got to take him to the station. He hasn't told you I called my boss. Everyone's been alerted. He wants to stay with me. I know, but he gave his word and he's in enough trouble. That's enough patience and understanding. He just wants to spend a bit more time with me. I didn't say that. Don't play with words. We were wrong about you, you'll let him down. That's not true, I'm just doing my job. I must take him back to Sète. I'm not a judge. If this carries on, I'm taking you both in. Look at him-showing off. I knew that'd happen. I'll go and get him. We've only just met. I can't let him down. Get out, now. Look sharp. - Let's talk it over. - We've talked enough. - I won't let him down. - Get out of the car. No! I'm coming with you. You're a damn nuisance! You're such a jerk. You gave me your word. Where's the gun? We've got to make a deal. - You've thrown it? - In a letterbox. You sure? - Yes? - Yes. Shit. - We've got to strike a deal. - That's enough. I only want to come with him. You came looking for me! Why the cuffs? He's not a gangster! Just go home, will you? Who's gonna stand up for him now? That's it, drive off! - Which one? - That one. This one here? - There's no caretaker? - Uncuff him! That'll do. Now go home! That's enough, both of you. I want to come with you. I want to go with him. Clear off! - What are you doing? - Don't move! Calm down. Give that to me. Get in the car. Get in. Careful what you're doing. Be careful. Just calm down. I want to come with you. No handcuffs. I don't want him handcuffed! No more cuffs! No more cuffs. Marc! Marc! Put them back on. - It'll help us calm down. - Hurry up Hurry up, dammit. We'll take them off later. These damn things are heavy. - Calm down. - Hurry up. - There we go. - It's all I'm asking. Is pointing guns at cops a family trait too? Does it run in the family? You just can't help yourselves? You've only just met him. You're a family of headcases! Yeah, it runs in the family. We're all headcases. You're a headcase, too. No one forced you to play the social worker. A cop is a cop. I said I wouldn't let him down. We're going to Sète, so it's okay. Yes, everything's just great. I've driven one way like this so I can drive back. No problem. What do you mean, "It's okay, we're going to Sète..." You want to go sightseeing on the way? I don't mind going with him now. Well, I do. I've only just met you and they'll take you away. You think that's normal? When will I see you again? You have an idea? - You never told me your name. - Nathalie. - It's nothing special. - It's a very pretty name. You've your father's surname? Yes. Alméra. I don't want to get you into trouble. I'll go to the cops by myself. We've not struck a deal yet. I said I wouldn't let you down. - You're scared stiff. - No. You are. Don't you like suspense? Stop it. Do you like suspense? There's no suspense. I know the outcome. Your motor's not bad, but it's more like a tractor. When I'm loaded, I'll buy a BMW. 165,000 francs. It's a lot of money, but I'll save up. I'll buy new, I don't trust secondhand. Do they do diesel? It's more economical. You should've got a BMW. A diesel Ferrari would be ace. BMW's have the radio turned towards the driver. The glove compartment looks 6 feet deep. How much is your car worth? I don't know, it's old. You don't know! It must be worth a packet. You're one weird guy. Let's take a break. Take the first on your right. - It's not the road to Sète. - Pull over. If he starts wetting himself, we'll have won. It's not his style, and what'll we gain? You in a hurry to go to the cops? That's not what I said. We could let him go and pinch his motor. I'm sure I can drive it. And be on the run? Give me the keys. - What about your pals? - I should've called them. They must be on the look-out. - Why have we stopped? - To talk This is doing my head in. - We're fine. - Really? Let's go then. He got what he wanted. What are you scheming? Don't let him think he can get away with this. I can tell he wants to get this over with. Say the window was my fault, or don't mention it at all. Say I led him into this. We've got to get our story straight. - Let him repay the stolen money. - No. I'll say I did it. I fired at the window. I took myself hostage. You're crazy! Let's go. Don't take the main roads. I'll wait for your answer. Lend us some money for a pizza. Marc mustn't touch the other money. I'll pay you back, don't worry. Don't you think he seems better? Yes. Go on, shoot me. Just do it. Marc! Stop playing with guns, it'll be better for everyone. I only want to take him back to Sète. We weren't hungry. My money. Take the secondary roads. Through Frontignan. Say something. We don't even know your name, even if we don't give a damn. I'm not upset if you don't want to talk to us. My name's Gerard. Okay. What are we doing? You're just following orders. I'm not listening to you anymore. It's better that way. Get out and clear off! He never fired that shot. - Let Marc give that money back. - It's stupid. Give me the keys. That's the way it is. I'm going for a swim. - It's too cold. - All the more reason. Two minutes, just a quick dip. It's pretty awesome meeting my sister like this. Is it complicated to change a name? I don't want to keep mine. It's normal for my sister and I to have the same name. Like your father, you mean? If you like, but it's really to be called like my sister. It won't be easy. Your father never legally recognized you. I hope my sister will agree to it. Isn't she a good swimmer? I'd have liked to work for the police. You meet people, you can help others. Yes... You watch girls swimming. It's time to go. We're waiting. - How is he? - Fine. He knows it's time. We'll go when he's ready. I left you alone with him to see if he's really ready. We've got to go, period! I'm asking you if he's ready. I said he's taking it well. If he sees us talking, he'll know you're upset. You should put your foot down more. He listens to you. Right now, you're being stupid. He's going to start thinking we're plotting against him. Okay, let's stop scheming. Why did you quit school? They do my head in. Especially in essay writing. They say I should talk better. The teacher's old so he talks old-fashioned. He uses lots of difficult words you only find in a dictionary. And his dictations are full of them. I get those words wrong. That's no reason to quit. I had a clash with my maths teacher. I was playing with a new lighter. She wanted to take if off me, I refused. She asked for it again, I refused. I threw it on the floor. She told me to pick it up. I threw it at her and left. Now, I don't want to go back. But it's the essay writing that got me down. If I was your mother, I'd have kicked your butt. Me too, if I was your sister. But you are. Don't make fun of that. When I was 12 or 13, I used to be a bit of a devil, just like you. I told my dad I wanted to be a boxer. He asked me if I'd already taken a real punch. I said yes. He asked me if I could stay on my feet. I said yes. He told me to get ready... With one punch, he knocked me out. I can't remember a thing, but when I woke up, I didn't want to box anymore. But if I'd thrown a lighter at my teacher, I'd have been in for it! He's right You shouldn't have thrown it. But she's a bitch. They're the bad guys. That's why you've quit? No. I wrote a good essay, even though there were faults. The teacher gave me top marks with a question mark. He thought I'd cheated. That's so bitchy. It was about the Titanic, I know all about it. I deserved my top mark. What do you do? Are you a waitress? Yes. How did you guess? Intuition. You suit each other. Marc's right. You're weird. You're helping him... Well, you don't really have a choice. But you don't actually see who he is, you're not really interested. Mind you, we could've come across a worse cop. He was lucky to meet you. It was kind telling that boxing story to Marc. What does he think of me? You said I don't really see him, so how can I give you an answer? He likes you. It's obvious. Because I'm his sister? No, not only that. He doesn't belong at the station. What will the cops see? Only his stupid behaviour. And he seems better now. I feel better since being with him. Can't you lie about him firing the gun - We give the money back. - No way. You should trust him. I'm sick of trusting him. So, down to the station, a shower and football on TV! Shut up. - You don't like football? - Yes, so what? Maybe he does too. - Do you like football? - No. My stepdad wanted me to play, but kicking the ball hurts. All that running about... I'm too lazy. It bugs me. Let me give the money back. I swear I won't play up. I don't trust you. And don't swear. I swear on my mother's life. I forgot the shampoo I bought. It was expensive. You want me to tell them that? It'll only take a few seconds. You can even tell the cops. To show we wanted to make amends. - Even if it doesn't. - It won't. So it won't change anything. Please? Don't piss me off. - You promised. - I made no promises. You can't trust a cop. And they like football. Be quick about it. Your money from this morning. I forgot my shampoo. When did you arrange that? Why are you following me? Where else can I go? I didn't tell him to run off. It's not my fault. I don't care. I've had it up to here! But we've got to find him. I'm going to explode. I need to look after myself. I'm not good at looking after others. The cops came. What's going on? - Nothing serious - It sounds serious to me. I said, it's nothing. And what's one more complaint? - Was my dad's name Alméra? - Yes. - Spelt A-L-M-E-R-A? - Yes. - I'm calling the cops. - Do what you want. I got you a present. I don't do that often. It's good shampoo. I paid for it myself. - You could say thanks. - Thanks. Your daughter's lovely. You've seen her? Didn't the cops tell you? She lives in Montpellier. She's a good sister to have. She promised she'd come and see you. Don't get too excited, she's not here yet. I've got this left. Never throw anything away. - You're tense. - How did you guess? They'll soon kick in. I'm such a damn fool. I've been such a damn mug. I've never seen such a stupid cop! What is this job anyway? Why did I get involved? What a fool. We've got to find Marc. I've got to go down to the station. I'm not up to it yet though. He's not going anywhere. We'll find him through my mum. Don't worry... no one's dead. You can't abandon him now. I don't care about him. I've bungled my job, that's the only thing. I'll just have to put up with my colleagues smirking. I shouldn't feel guilty. We've got to find Marc. - Is Jeremy in? - Yes. Can I stay? They're fighting at home. Yes, but you both stay in. I don't fancy roaming the streets tonight. - Alright? - Hi. Heard the cops were at your place. I pulled a gun on a cop. On a cop? I swear, with my stepdad's gun. I'm avoiding him. I'm in for it when he catches me! "I don't want to kill you!" It brings respect! Franck's dad, the gendarme, said he's never been scared. But he was in Vietnam and Algeria. He's as stupid as his son. The cop was well scared! I could've easily done him in. It goes to your head. I cuffed him to the driving wheel. But I was really on edge. I found out my real dad's name. You draw better than me, so change my name. It'll rub off easily. - Try anyway. - It won't be a neat job. Just cross it out, but use a ruler. - Haven't got one. - You haven't got anything. It's not surprising we flunk school, we don't have any stuff. - Try with a book. - If you want. I'll spell it out, but be careful. A... L-M-E... with an accent, R... There you go. I like my old name underneath. You can tell I'm changing it. Thanks a lot. - Are you Marc's mum? - Yes. I'm Nathalie. I don't want to bother you, but I must find Marc. I don't know where he is. The cops have already been. He must be at a friend's. Does he have a best friend? There's Olivier and Jeremy. They live in the block? Olivier's surname is Espinelli, Jeremy's is Roger, like a first name. I'll try them. I'll come back. And I'm doing fine. Marc... A young girl's here for you. Why did you run off? You shouldn't have come. You should've stayed in Montpellier. - You asked me to help. - I don't want to go with the cop. - Everyone's worried. - Who? Me, the cop, your mum... You should see her face. - The cop looks a right fool. - I don't care. Go and tell them you can't trust me. Pin it all on me. Okay, I'll go to the cops after school tomorrow. What's all this about school? Some kind of new obsession? It's an excuse to avoid keeping your word. I don't want to become a gangster. You can't understand. - Because I'm a girl. - No. Didn't he take you to the station? He's gone crazy. I didn't want to go without you. I hid at his place whilst other cops questioned him. That's odd. He's gone crazy. And you're the one who ran away, so I should be telling you off. Don't you start shouting at me! So we stick together? I'll get my bag. Explain why you want to go back to school. - Where are we going? - The cop's flat. You'll tell them today was out of character? And that now you want to work hard? Am I warm? Give me a hint. Next to a photo. Next to a photo. I don't get it. You can't work if you have a false name. It's dangerous, it causes trouble. It's as if you're not yourself. Whether I go today or tomorrow changes everything. Whatever they'll do with me can wait. - Can I have your name? - Of course. You let no one get close. I'm not used to it. I prefer taking the lead. I'm caught off balance if a girl makes the first move. But you're my sister, it's different. I'm not used to it yet. We should get my little sister and live together in La Courneuve. It's great in La Courneuve. - Is it far? - No, we're here. I was scared you wouldn't open after taking all those pills. You should've called the cops. What's he doing here? Can we come in? Go to the cops and piss off. I've had my fill for one day. You've not got it... We want to sleep here. You're off your rocker! There's something I must tell you. I'll only take a minute. - Wait here. - I'm not going anywhere. - I know why he ran off. - I don't. He'll tell you, because if I do, you won't believe me. Marc. Tell him. I want to go to school with my new name. He's crossed his name out on his ID and put mine in. That's daft! We'll wait for him outside school, then to the cops. - So you can save my reputation? - No, so you can take us in. It's so kind. I'm so moved. Don't you realize his name means everything to him? You should find it moving. He'll feel easier if you're the one who takes us in. You can't sleep here. It's absurd. - You thinking or sulking? - If I think, I call the cops. - You're sulking. - At least I don't hassle others! - I prefer a thump - Each to his own. Don't sulk, it makes others nasty. - A thump doesn't? - It's no worse than sulking. - It's for cowards. - That's your line. Watch it, you'll forget to sulk. - Who's sulking now? - Go and call your pals. It's not our fault you didn't call the cops. But thanks for not calling. You'd have made a good boxer. Boxing women around... That's no job. - Can I make a call? - Yes. You don't hit girls. It was only a slap. - You've never hit a girl? - No. Yes I have. Two years ago at a fair A girl shoved me and told me to get lost. I head-butted her, broke her nose. It was my first head-butt. I ran off quickly! We pushed you to it. We've been a lot of hassle. It's normal you don't trust us. We're a pain in the neck. - She's calling home? - Yes. To her boyfriend, I think. What about you? Girls don't scare you? I don't chase after girls. I've never been lucky. There was Caroline, a right slut... I gave her until evening to say if she'd go out with me. She told me to piss off! Mind you, she heard I was with another that afternoon. That girl's not bad. But... it's like talking to a wall. She doesn't get a word of what you're saying. You can't talk to her. I'm not very lucky either, but it's my own fault. - Why? - I don't know why. Sometimes you want to be manly... Sometimes you want to be taken care of Like by your mother. She left me. I realized I'd done my best to show her I was a shit. But it's not true... I can be great if I want to. It was a kick in the face. But it made me a better man. But I never go out. That's daft, you should go out. Probably. I'll see what she's doing. He's not at home. I don't even give a damn. I nag even when I've stopped loving them. I make myself ill. Did a woman live here? Yes. A pain, like me? - She left? - It's complicated. - What if she came back? - She won't. It's better like that. What's it got to do with you? I don't like leaving my brother in the corridor. - He can sleep in my bed. - Thanks. Don't thank me, it's not your style. We're going to catch it! But I'm glad I came. Thanks for coming after me. Don't spend all night talking to him. Stay here. It'd be weird doing it with a cop. I don't think now's the time. - Sleep well? - Yes. - Wake your sister up. - Her name's Nathalie. - You don't call her that. - I don't know her very well. And I do? I'm going to marry her. Rubbish. You only met her yesterday. One day's long enough. I catch on quick. - Jealous? - Don't be daft! You introduced us. It's all your doing. We're going to be late. You asked her? Yes, but like you, she doesn't agree. Are you going to wake "Nathalie" up? Nathalie, wake up. Wake up. We didn't sleep at your place, okay? We slept out on the bridge. And you didn't drive us to school. He didn't fire the gun, or you wouldn't have driven us to school. We won't tell the cops he drove us here. We're going to get muddled up. We didn't fire the gun, and I ran off after you went to the shop. We've got to get that bit straight. And you say that I threatened you at my place. Keep that bit. I'm off. - What should we say? - The truth. Like that, we don't get mixed up, and they'll understand. Are you ashamed of any of this? Well? Then we'll tell the truth. In any case, I'll say he didn't mean to fire. Because it's the truth. Good morning. Quiet please. Oh, hello stranger! Mr Turot... To what do we owe this honour? You've gone deaf? If you're talking to me, that's no longer my name. Go and inform the headmaster of your new identity. He's going to be thrilled. We're handing him over on a plate. I'm not proud of myself. I've really messed up. I don't think so. We have the same name. No one wants a false name. Take me back with my real name and I'll work hard. We have three problems: First, your unjustified absence. I was angry. The teacher thought I hadn't done the work myself. Let me finish. Then this new name appears out of the blue. It's Alméra. Maybe, but you come back to school under your old name. The third isn't up to me. I'd like us to wait here together, and consider the problems you cause us. If it was up to you, you'd agree? I gave you my answer. But if it was up to you... Is it that difficult to say yes? Please wait here with me in silence. The cops are long in coming? Is that it? I'll never come back under my old name. The bastards didn't want to know. Your friends have arrived. The head called them. Why are you here? You've got a nerve! I'm going to the station. If you're in a rush, go on ahead. When this is all over, I'll take Stephanie out of care... as soon as I'm 18. I don't care what anyone says. I'll get a nice quiet job. I'll look after my little sister. She'll be happy. You can visit us. I'm alright with that. We could live together, you, me and Stephanie. But sod the others! When this is all over, I'll take Stephanie out of care. I'll look after my little sister. She'll be happy.
