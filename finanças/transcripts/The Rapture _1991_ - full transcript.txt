But fun, definitely fun. We're very social people. You might be asking for something you can't handle. I can handle it. Man: What if things go out of control? Ha. What's control got to do with it? I think he wants to find out if you have any limits. Tell him I haven't found them yet. Vic: Sharon hasn't found her limits yet. Talk, talk, talk. Let's go somewhere. I have a store.

Please hold for the number. Hi, wayne. Quite strong last night, wasn't it? By a factor of 5. It was almost like the first time. I mean, it was that clear. And the horn. The sound of the horn, that was new. One note, a very clear tone. I found it on my piano. It's a b-flat. What do you think? I think it's going to happen, and soon. Have you been praying? Yeah, as much as I can. Shh. Woman: What does the boy say? Not yet. Ha ha. Ahh. Mmm. Tell me a story. No, no, no. I already know that story. Tell me something new. I've done things for money. Like what? Things I wish I hadn't. Like what? I killed a man once. For how much? For $1,000. It's not very much money. It was a lot then. All I can say now is I wish I hadn't. Why? 'Cause it stays with me. I mean, I killed a man. I took his life. His only life. That's bad. Did you know him? No. Well, why did the people that paid you want him dead? There are some questions you just don't ask. After that, they offered me another job, though. Same kind of job, better money. Did you do it? No. But I think about that killing a lot, and I, you know, if we weren't taught that killing is bad, would I still feel this bad? I don't know. You don't know? Mm-mmm. Ha. Are you scared of me now? Did anyone pay you to kill me? That was not a good year. 1975, that was my best year. I was 19. Hmm? What was your best year? Mmm. I guess I'm still waiting. I don't know. I don't know. Everything just seems so... empty. Time passes so quickly. Yeah? I think it's kind of slow. No, I mean... I mean like a day, you know? A day is always just over. Ohh! I don't know what I'm trying to say. No, I think I understand. Oh, really? Ha. Why don't you let me in on my secret? I think you're depressed, and I think you should see a therapist. Oh, that's great. That's fucking brilliant. You understand that these are the last days. You can't go on like this. God is coming back. His prophecies are now being fulfilled. You have to accept Jesus as your lord and savior. Otherwise? You won't be saved. We're not trying to scare you. No. Do you understand the difference between righteousness and faith? Why don't you tell me? It's only by the grace of god you'll be saved. Well, what if I lead a good life? Does it still matter if I don't believe? Do you really lead a good life? No. You have to believe. If you don't... you go to hell. Well, that doesn't seem fair. I used to think that, but then I met him. Sharon: Who? That's what we're trying to tell you. "For god so loved the world, "he gave his only begotten son, "that whosoever believeth in his name should not perish, but have everlasting life." You can have what we have. A personal relationship with the son of god. It's hard to believe unless you believe, but when you believe it, then it's easy. You just know. What? Him. How? Who knows? It just is. Right. And I'm supposed to buy this? No. It's a gift. We know what you're thinking. Doesn't make sense. No. I was like you. I doubt it. No, really. Like I said, I doubt it. I heard someone talking about the boy. Who's the boy? Some people say that he's a prophet in the old tradition. Some people say there's others like him all around the country. All around the world. And what do you say? I say trust in god. Excuse me. Operator 134. What city, please? City, please? Please hold for the number. Operator 134. What city, please? Is that a business or residence? Hello. Sharon. Hi, vic. I dropped by a few of the hotels near the airport today. You'll never guess who I found. The most fascinating couple, really. They're from philadelphia. Well, he's from pennsylvania, but she's from florida, and they're married. Isn't that romantic? What time? Pick you up at 9:00. Ha ha ha. Whoo. Here's to open-minded people... in I.a... my kind of town. Honey, don't you have something better to do? I'm doing it. Whoosh. Oh, you. You again? Mm-hmm. Again. What is that? Vic: What are you talking about? She has a tattoo on her back. Wow. Got it when I was a kid. This was before she met me. Just... just got drunk one night. One night? You had it done in one night? Well, you know how kids are. I almost got a tattoo once. She was drunk. Angie, you got that in one night? Sharon, she doesn't want to talk about it. There's nothing to talk about. Why did you get it? Sharon, can we talk about it later? Sharon: I mean, it must have been painful. I don't remember, and I don't know why I got it. It's ok, angie. I'm here. I'm with you. Why would you get a tattoo that you didn't really want? I'm sorry. I don't mean to make you unhappy, but I really need to know. Why? I don't know. I don't know, but it's important. What is it? Don't you know what's going on? What? The dream. The pearl. What dream? Tell them. Think about it. That would be a miracle. Hi. It's a beautiful day, isn't it? How are you? We're fine. And you? I'm fine, now that I dream about the pearl. What dream would that be? The pearl. I dream about the pearl. Woman: Tell us about it. Older man: What's it look like? Well, you know. The pearl. It's... it's a big pearl by a river. No, it's not. You haven't seen it. Sharon: Yes, I have. You can't fake it. Well, it's a message from god. If you really want it, all you have to do is pray. Pray? Younger man: He's coming back. Slow down. If everybody's getting this dream, how come it isn't on the news? Those who need to know know. And those that don't believe won't get the dream. There are 5 billion people on the planet. There's I don't know how many religions. Why does the god of some little country on the mediterranean have to be the god for everyone? Isn't that a little arrogant? I mean, really. The buddhists get along ok without Jesus christ. The hindus get along ok without Jesus christ. The muslims seem to be getting along ok without Jesus christ. But none of them are saved. Sharon, this is my friend andrea. Andrea's from nebraska. Come and join. Get up. What? Get up or get out. Ohh. What'd I do? I have to make the bed. Look, it's 3:00 in the morning. Get out of bed or get out of the house. Why? This bed is unclean. No, no. Unclean? You changed the sheets yesterday. Shut up! I'm starting over, randy. I've had enough. Enough what? I need a new direction in my life. There is a god. I know it. There is a god, and I'm going to meet him. When did you get religion? I am trying, randy. I want my salvation. Sharon, you're fine the way you are. You just want to live in sin, don't you? Yeah... ha ha... that's right. I just want to live in sin. Fine. Be a slave to the devil. Devil? You remember where we met? Don't start asking me now to apologize for who I am or what I believe in. Oh, and what do you believe in? There is no god. There's only chaos. Why do we have such guilty consciences? Answer that. You're the one with a guilty conscience. I sleep really well. At least I used to. Ow. Jesus christ, that's hot. Don't take the lord's name in vain, randy. That's one of the commandments, and it comes before theft and adultery. It even comes before murder. That's how important it is not to take the lord's name in vain. Yeah? Since when have you known the lord? I am trying to. But what does a shower at 3:00 in the morning have to do with eternal salvation? I want to be clean. Am I clean? Yeah, you're clean. When we do something wrong... we feel bad, and that's because there's a little bit of god... inside of all of us telling it's time to... change our ways before it's too late. Isn't that right? No, that's not right. It's just conditioned by society. All we are is animals whose brains have become too big and too complicated for the purposes of satisfying our animal needs, which are food and sex. There's a spiritual need just as real as hunger, just as real as the need for love. Sharon, don't you understand what's going on? The world's a disaster, we have no power to make it better. You hate your job, you hate your life... but you want to feel special. And instead of letting me do that, you're rushing off to something that's not even there. Man outside: Mary, you need to get the hell outta here! There's no... pearl. There's only us. I feel sorry for you, randy. I really do. But you have to leave. I don't want to leave. I want to stay here with you. You know me. We know each other. We know each other's secrets. That's something. I think we can love each other, and I think you feel that, too. There has to be something more. Why? I'm tired of the pain in my life. I'm tired of feeling empty all the time. Let me help you. We can't we let god help both of us? Because there is no god. God, please. Please, please help me. God, I'm lost. Chicks don't usually stop for me. I think they think I'm dangerous. They're probably right. I'm not as dangerous as some guys are, you know. But I would never give me a lift, that's for sure. No way. If I was a chick, no double-fucking way would I give me a lift. I've looked in the mirror. I've seen myself. I mean... with my thumb out, and I was a chick and I saw me, no, sir. Now, on the other hand, if I was, uh, if I was one who was hitching, I was a chick, I'd stop for me in a second. In fact I'd... I'd... i'd fuck me, too. In fact, if I was hitching and I was a chick and I got stopped by a chick, I'd fuck me that way, too. Yeah. In fact, I wouldn't mind getting into a bi-girl scene with myself. Actually, you're the first chick that's ever given me a lift. I don't think other chicks pick me up 'cause they can tell I carry a gun and I've been to prison in vermont. I... I don't think that's where they can tell I've been to prison, but that's where I'm from... vermont. You ever been to vermont? I'm from the lemonfaire valley. Actually, there's no lemons in vermont. Actually comes from the french... Les monts verts... which means the green mountains... which is what vermont means... green mountains. Ver... green, mont... mountains. Vermont... green mountains. Anyway... my father's a farmer. I left home. What's your name? I'm tommy. Sharon. Oh, yeah? With who? What? Who you sharin' it with? You gonna share it with me? Sharon... you know that the state bird of vermont is the hermit thrush? Bet you didn't know that. State flower is the red clover. Highest point is mount mansfield, I believe, which is 4,393... something. I don't know. Hey, you got a quarter? Get some magic fingers going in here. How'd that be? It's time for you to go, tommy. Huh? You have to go now. And you have to leave me your gun. Arrrr! [I'll be your mirror plays in background] Unh! Can I get dressed? Where were you? Turn around. Really? Come on. Where have you been? I went away for a few days. Who'd you go with? No one. Meet anyone? Yes. Yes, I did. I did meet someone. You're ok? I'm fine, vic. I'm really, really fine. Uh-uh. No, you're not. Something's going on. You've changed. You've got this look right now. What look? The goofy smile. If I tell you, you're not going to believe me, but I have to tell you, so it really doesn't matter if you don't believe me. It doesn't matter to me. I mean, it matters to me, but you're the one who really needs to hear this now. You met a guy. Well, "guy" is not exactly the word I'd use for him. You fox. You fell in love. Yes. Wait till he finds out about you. Oh, he knows all about me. Is he as bad a boy as I am? I think you should meet him. You told him about me? I told you... He knows everything. He's rich, right? He's some rich guy, and you fell for some line of his. You could love him, too. Oh, ho ho ho ho... you fell for some rich homosexual. Ha ha ha ha... ha ha ha ha... he's the lord Jesus christ, vic. He's the son of god. Sharon... you quit your job? Why would I do that? To go to the airport, sell flowers, do whatever the cult wants you to do. You can't understand, but I... I know what that's like. Until it happens to you and until you accept god into your heart, it's like a fairy tale. It's like some joke that you just don't get. I think you need to be deprogrammed. There is no cult, vic. There's only god and his message of love. Love? Love. Look, you'll give this up someday. I know you. You'll give this up. This is forever. Everybody says that. This is different. Everybody says that, too. Sharon, call me when this is over. Hold for the number. Hi. Who's this? Hi, susanna. This is sharon. Have you met Jesus? Oh, I'm sure you're in a hurry, but don't you think you could take time out to get to know your lord and savior? Well, ok, you have a nice day, too. Oh, what was the number you wanted? Here you go. Hi, this is sharon. Who's this? Hi, maria. Have you met god? You have. Isn't he wonderful? You're supposed to spend a maximum of 15 seconds on each call. Do you know what your average has been? No. Take a guess. 20 seconds 2 minutes. You were clocked on one call at 7 minutes 15. I am just trying to do my job. It seems like you're trying to do two jobs out there. We only have one job. That's right, and you're not doing the one that you're being paid for. Henry... god made me an information operator for a reason. I'm in a position to spread his word to hundreds of people every day. Personally. One-to-one. God? I know you can't believe this, but god is coming back to judge the world, and it's important. I have to tell people. We have to prepare for his return. When did you first see the light? A few days ago. Mm-hmm. You don't believe me. Sometimes people have heard about the pearl, and they try to pretend like they've seen it, but you can always tell when they're lying. You just can't fake it. You? When they first meet him, everyone thinks that judgment day is just around the corner. I remember that feeling very well. It's a powerful feeling. But that sense that it's going to happen tomorrow passes when tomorrow comes and he doesn't, and then you understand that those feelings, as powerful as they are, and the dreams, as real as they are, are still just shadows of the real thing, and no one can say how far away that real thing really is. But the feeling is so strong. I don't know you, but I know you. A lot of people who have come to god have been broken, they've been messed up by life. The unbelievers try to make it seem like there's something wrong with us, that we're stupid. But only the humble hear the voice of god. You're alone, aren't you? It's hard at the beginning. You give up your whole life just like you've come to a new country. Your old friends cannot really be your friends anymore. What do I do? Trust in god. And take it easy on the phones. Who's the boy? God is coming back, and there are wars and rumors of wars, and a curse devours the earth and those who live in it are held guilty. God is coming back. There are wars and rumors of wars, and a curse devours the earth, and those who live in it are held guilty. We have to wait. We have to wait. For how long? Probably a few years. 5 years, 6 years. Probably a few years. 5 years, 6 years. Hi, randy. Oh, uh... sharon, right? Sharon. How's that apartment coming? Is it still unclean? No. So you found your salvation. Congratulations. I found god. Oh, yeah? Is he gonna move in, or did he keep his own place, or you gonna do that commuting thing? You got to watch that. It's very tough on a relationship. Why are you here? I know you're as lost as I was, randy, and I wanted to tell you that you could know god. If you just surrender your pride, you can know god. Sharon, it's just a drug. You're in pain. Instead of doing heroin, you're doing god, and I need sandpaper. Randy, god is real. God is not make-believe, and you know that. You don't want to admit it because you're afraid. What am I afraid of? What we're all afraid of... God's judgment. No. I'm not. I don't want to lose you. You just want to save my soul. At least you know you have one. I don't want to tell my secrets in church. I'll pray for both of us. You'd stay with me even if I didn't pray? So far we're still in the realm of signs and wonders, but the rapture is coming. It says so in the bible. Our bodies will be transformed into spirit, and then we'll be caught up in the clouds to meet god. The end is coming soon. This year. Ever since I was a kid, I had this feeling that something was going to happen to me. I always knew that when it happened that I'd recognize it. I wouldn't mistake it for something else. I wouldn't have something happen to me and say this is it and later on say, "nah, that wasn't it." It was a secret feeling, and I never told anybody about it. What's the feeling now? Something's gonna happen. Where is heaven? It's in the sky. Why can't we see it? You will. But why can't we see it now? Mary? Mm-hmm. Do you love baby Jesus? Yes. Well, then you'll see him real soon. What does the bible say? We who are alive, who are saved, will be taken bodily into heaven. Oh, sharon, sharon! You just can't accept god, can you? Nope. Well, maybe we should talk about that for a minute. Ok. So do you mean that if you're a christian and you were ironing your shirts and the rapture happens, you get taken up to heaven in the middle of doing your laundry? Well, does god give you time to turn off the iron, or do your shirts burn? I wear permanent press. Well, I mean, what's supposed to happen? You're supposed to float up into the sky? In the twinkling of an eye the body will be transformed into spirit. And there is a warning. If you listen, if you pray for it, there's going to be a warning. We'll hear the sound of trumpets, god's angels. Iouis... louis... I'm trying to say this without causing you a lot of pain. Any way you say it, I'm fired, right? We have struggled together, but you have to admit, it hasn't worked out. It's 'cause I'm not kissing ass around here, isn't it? Iouis, it's because you're not doing your job. You're not doing your job, bananahead. Iouis, we tried to get you help. I don't want your fucking help! We took you to a counselor. You took me to a homo! I took you to an aa meeting. They're a bunch of a-holes. A-holes the lot of them! And you're an a-hole. And I'm tired of kissing your christian a-hole! What are you looking at?! Iouis, I'll pray for you. Oh, fuck you!!! Get down! Ok. Ok... louis... no speeches, preacher. I have a little girl. So what? Come in. You see, now's one of those times when I wish I was a believer. Why? 'Cause I would have a rock to stand on. 'Cause I could tell myself everything was for the better because god has a plan. But it is... because he does. Oh, it is so hard for me, sharon. I try to resist it as much as possible. So you do feel something tugging at you, don't you? I tell myself it's just conditioning, it's how I was raised. I tell myself if we didn't tell our children about god, they wouldn't ask. It is a story we tell ourselves so everything makes sense. It's not. How do you know? The bible. Don't tell me "the bible." It's a question of faith. So there's no proof? Paula, the universe you live in is a cold and empty place. The universe I live in is filled with god. Will we see daddy again? Yes. When we die? Or when god takes us to heaven. When the rapture comes, does that mean we die? Not exactly. So... you can go to heaven without dying? Yeah. But... if you die, then you can still go to heaven? Yeah. So daddy is going to heaven. No. Daddy's already in heaven. If we pray to daddy, can he hear us? Well, we pray to god, and god tells daddy what we're saying... that way he can hear everything. Ok? Boy: This is from the book of revelations, chapter 12, verse 6. It says... "and the woman fled into the desert where she had a place prepared for her by god." Is anyone else getting visions that tells us we have to go to the desert? You don't believe me. I do. What does it mean? You're the only one who can hear these calls. It could be satan. I don't think so. Then god wants you for a special purpose. Please come with me. We haven't been invited. But I'm scared. Don't ask god to meet you halfway. What does that mean? Sharon, you can't just leave like this. Yes, I can. God is calling me. No, no. No, sharon. What about mary? God is calling her, too. Why don't you sell the house? You can't just walk away from it. Of course I can. There's a better house waiting for me. God is building me a mansion right now. What should I wear? God won't come, the bank will own your home, and what are you going to do then? I'm going to heaven. Mary and I are going to heaven, and we'll be wearing these dresses together when we finally see god. Randy always loved this dress. I'll wear it for him. I'm going to be seeing him soon. And he always loved to see mary in this. Don't you get white robes and wings? Angels don't have wings. I don't know about the robes. I don't know what they wear. I guess I'll find out. So then what's the sweater for? It gets cold in the desert at night. Winter is coming. You're going to need more than a sweater. He's taking us soon. Very soon. How do you know? He told me. Sharon... sharon, listen to me. I don't know if you can hear me, but listen to me. You need food. Not that much. You need a tent. I don't want you guys sleeping out in the car, ok? Candles... matches... flashlight. Thank you, paula. You need something else. You can't go out in the desert alone. There are a lot of creeps out there, sharon, and a woman alone... I'm scared. God will take care of us. Maybe. Insurance. Oh, paula, no. You don't have to use it, but you have to take it. And you can bring it back to me when you come home. I'm not coming home. Mom? Yes, mary? This doesn't look like heaven, mom. This isn't heaven, honey. Then why stop here? Think of heaven as a great big hotel or a big office building. Yeah? Well, this is the lobby. This is where we have to wait. For what? The elevator. Man: That's it. Come on. Everybody out. Are you waiting for god, too? Oh, is that what you guys are doing here? God is coming back. Sounds good. He really is. Ok. He's coming tomorrow. No. Soon, mary. He's coming soon. That's it, mary! That's it! Come on, let's go. Let's hurry. Come on, mary. No, my panda! Come on... go. I... I miss my daddy. Honey, I miss your daddy, too. I wanna see him again. You will. You will see him in heaven. Why can't we go to heaven, mommy? I wanna go to heaven. We have to wait until god calls us. Did god call daddy? When you die, is that when god calls you? Yeah. Then I wanna die. Oh, sweetie, no. You wanna go to heaven, don't you? Yes. And you believe... that when we die, we'll go to heaven because we're saved, right? Yes. Then why can't we just die and go there really quickly and be with daddy again? Why do we have to stay here and hang around and wait for god? Come on, mom... let's die. Let's give god one more chance. Howdy. Hello. I'm foster madison. Sharon and mary. Oh, yeah? I have a little sister named mary. She's all grown up now. Are you with god? No. I'm with the sheriff. We're waiting for our father. Where's he? Heaven. Don't you go to school? I don't have to go to school. I'm not asking you to understand or to have faith, but... the end of the world is coming, and... we're a lot safer out here. Well, there's a 2-week limit on staying here. Is that a limit on how long I can stay in the park, or just this particular campsite? Actually, it's just a limit on how long you can use this particular campsite. Ok, so if I move over there or over there or over there, I can stay another 2 weeks? Technically, I can't stop you. Thank you. Could I ask you a question? Sure. Is this good for your little girl? Have you been saved? No. Do you know what that means? Yeah. Would you like to be? Oh, yeah, yeah... sure. Who wouldn't? Why is it so hard for you to pray? Well, you have to surrender to god, don't you? That's right. It's in my training... I don't give up my gun. But... you'd like to believe. That these are the last days? You know they are. God is coming back to judge the world. A lot of people are gonna suffer. You know, I hope that's not true, but if it is, and there's no law against it, my hands are tied. I bet with a little prayer, you'd be on my side in an hour. Well, then it's time for me to go. Watch out for coyotes. Good-bye. Bye. Mom? Mommy? What? Mom... i'm hungry. You said you'd give him one more chance. Who? God. You said we'd give god one more chance. And if we didn't get the rapture, that we could die. That's what you said. You promised. Baby... don't you believe in god? Yes. Don't you love god? Then why can't we just go to god? Go now. Now. One more chance. I was in the neighborhood. Thought you'd stop by for a cup of sugar? No. Actually, I brought you this. We have sleeping bags. Yeah, I know. It's just, sometimes, you wanna sit on the ground, you don't wanna get dirty, it's nice to have a blanket. Thank you. I, uh... I also brought your little girl... It's just a candy bar. I know that moms are worried about cavities, so if you don't wanna give it to her, you know, I'll understand. I'll give it to her. You can share it. Thanks. Well... I'll check up on you again sometime if that's ok. Thank you. Aaaaaah! Mom, you have to make up your mind now! Gabriel's coming, mom! Gabriel's coming! It's god, mom! It's god! Don't ask god to meet you halfway! Mommy! Mary... mary, wake up. It's ok, honey... it's ok. Oh, baby, you're just hungry. We'll get something to eat. We'll go to town. No. We can't leave. Yes, we can. But we don't need any food. God will give us food when we get to heaven. I'll be in heaven tonight. There was a river, and I was in heaven. Where was I? You were there... good. Sort of. You were there, but only sort of. It's almost morning. Soon as the sun comes up, we'll get something to eat. $5.65, please. Oh, no, you don't. Call the police. No. Why not? She had a kid. Do you love me? Yes. Do you love Jesus? Yes. You know, in heaven, there's Jesus and baby Jesus together, and baby Jesus has the special job of... he has the special job... of looking out for all the children. Mary, do you love baby Jesus? Yes. It's not fair to make you pay because I'm lost. If god loves us, he'll understand. We're going to heaven now. We're going... together? Together. And daddy? Daddy's in heaven? Daddy... we'll see daddy, yes... and we'll be together forever because nothing is broken in heaven. I love you. Daddy... you have to love god, mary. Do you love god? Yes. Tell him that. Don't be afraid, baby. Aaaaah! Aaaaah! [steady rumbling grows ever louder] Could you get out of the car, please? Well, what happened to god? What's wrong? I need to see your license and your registration, please. They're in the car. Thank you. Could you step over in... In the light, please? Sharon... here. Where's your little girl? She's with god. She died? Mary? How? I killed her. I was gonna kill myself, too, but... you can't get into heaven if you kill yourself. You can get into heaven if somebody else kills you, but not if you kill yourself. Life is some... kind of punishment, isn't it? You have to go through with it even when you know what life is for. What is life for? Ask god. And what does he say? I think... he says that, basically, that you have to love him no matter what... but I don't love him! Not anymore. He has too many rules. He told me to meet him in the desert, and I did, and I waited, and he didn't come. He broke his promise. He let me kill my little girl, and he still expects me to love him? I'm afraid of hell, so I have to wait out my life waiting for god. Now... he'll forgive me, and he'll let me join my daughter and my husband in heaven, but first, I have to say I love him. You can send me to the gas chamber, and if I let god into my heart before I die... then I can go to heaven because god is merciful. How fast was I going? 100 miles an hour. 100 miles an hour. If I'd have gone off a bridge and died, would I have gone to heaven? I don't know. Neither do i. I know you. I should be embarrassed to tell you where we met, but I'm not ashamed. I'm not ashamed of anything anymore. I found god. God found me. I was preaching the word of god in a shopping mall in palm springs, and they had me kicked out. So I went back in. Then they had me arrested. Have you heard the word of god? It's the greatest gift of all time. You have to trust completely in god. He'll forgive all your sins. Who forgives god? God is coming back, mommy. There are wars and rumors of wars, mommy, and a curse devours the earth, and those who live in it are held guilty. He said he would take us to heaven. Mother, listen to me. The living outnumber the dead. The armies of the lord are waiting for the day of judgment. Don't you still love god, mommy? He left us alone... Alone in the desert. He let me kill you. But do you still love him? How can I love a god that let me kill my baby? God loves you because you love him. Why? I know you want me back, but I can't come back, mommy. I'm dead. That's the first call! It's gabriel blowing his trumpet! There'll be 6 more calls! You have until the last call to repent! After that it's too late! Tv: There's the snap. Hands off to henderson. Henderson's going to the inside, and he's tackled at the 15-yard line. Angie: It's god! He's giving us a last chance to save ourselves. That's war. It's the first horseman of the apocalypse. ♪ Hark, the herald angels sing ♪ ♪ glory to the newborn king ♪ ♪ peace on earth and mercy mild ♪ ♪ god and sinners reconciled ♪ ♪ joyful all ye nations rise ♪ ♪ join the triumph of the skies ♪ ♪ with angelic hosts proclaim ♪ ♪ christ is born ♪ ♪ in bethlehem ♪ angie: What more do you need? Get out of here. What are you doing here? I want to know what happens next. Are you scared? I don't know. I never had any faith. But you did. Yep. So... so. Well, if the world is coming to an end, this isn't the place to be. Now let's go. No! No, I don't want to go! Don't let me go! No! Mom? Hi, mom. Is this hell? Hello, mary? Is this your daughter? Mary, where are you? I'm here. Where are we? You know when you hear those songs about the river that washes away all your sins? Well, here it is. We're in heaven. Why are we in heaven? We're not in heaven. Heaven's over there. I can't see it. It's there. If you love god, it's there. Foster... do you love god for giving you the gift of life? Yes. No! Mommy, gabriel's coming. You have to make up your mind. There's nothing more to say. You have to love god. I love you, mary. That isn't enough. Baby, it's all I have. If life is a gift... if it really is a gift and there really is a heaven... There really is a heaven. Then why should I thank him for the gift of so much suffering, mary? So much pain on the earth that he created? Let me ask him why. Tell god you love him! I can't. If you don't tell god that you love him, you can't go to heaven. Tell god that you love him! Mommy! No. Do you see heaven? Yes. Isn't it beautiful? Yes. Do you know how long you have to stay here? Yes. How long? Forever.
