They have business together, that's all I know We'll see about that - Was all well at the bank? - Yes, they gave me a receipt Are the flowers for me? It seems I was expected at the bank. A cop was waiting when I came out He knew all about me, even my name He wanted information. I think he was after someone bigger I don't want to end up in jail If you see him again, you don't know a thing I told him. But he knows my name Flowers last longer cut aslant; they get more water - I know - Then do it And use cold water Who is Monsieur Gautier? He knows my name, too. He phoned a while ago The green stuff is asparagus fern; the shops put it in for padding People with taste throw it out So who is Gautier? Some sort of rich pimp? Tell me, I want to know You want to know? All right, I'll tell you who Monsieur Gautier is A horse, a winner. And I'm trying to get a holiday for you and me As for your fantasy cop, if you get his name, I'll take care of him I'll be back in two hours - Staying here? - I'll wait for you Get off that Look what the dog did I'm late Did you give Gautier all your money again.

Take your places Clara, that's not your place Let's begin... it's winter It's cold. You are prostitutes, there are no customers If you go home empty-handed, you'll be punished A man walks by in the empty street You look at him. You smile You caress each other to get his attention. You kiss Again. More! Better than that! Stronger! That's better I'm a bit late Wait in the corner. Mistress will be here soon On the Cross. Five minutes to get into position Lucienne, you can go. I'll be back in a moment - I want you now - This isn't the moment. I'm late Later I'm having you in front of them Not in front of them. Don't do that, I beg you - I want to see Monsieur Gautier - You have an appointment? Gautier? I'm Olivier Well? This must stop. I love Ariane. She's afraid of you Are you sure? Has she said so? I can tell - A drink? - That won't change anything The thought never crossed my mind Be seated So, what can I do for you? Nothing for me, but you can leave Ariane alone She tried to jump out the window Yes, if I hadn't stopped her in time... Then she called you, wanted to see you at once I saw her. She said she needed a holiday I have a suggestion. From now on, I take care of her - How? - As you do But I'll take a smaller cut and I'll really protect her You're sure we both take care of women in the same manner? That's beside the point I want you to return some of the money you took from her I want 10,000 francs now - Do you realise who I am? - Who cares? Aren't you rather rash? That will be all for the moment It's all settled. Don't answer the phones Switch them off. I'll explain Same again, please Haven't you had enough? You owe 25 francs Keep the change He's a nut case Repeat that Carry on like that and I'll come out What are you doing here? Get out! Horsemeat Two steaks, please What are you up to? - Steak at this hour? - It's good Why did you tell me not to answer the phones? I'd been drinking I can smell it A surprise for you Where did that come from? -10,000 francs. - So I see For you Maybe I was stupid You wouldn't tell me, so I found out for myself I met your Gautier From now on, you won't have to give him such a big cut Not coming to bed? Don't touch me Yes, he told me No, I promise you, he's quite harmless Right away? Impossible. I can't right now I beg you, not now. I can't You're leaving. It's allover Pack, dress, get out Understand? Idiot! How could you have done it? You wanted to find out for yourself. Weren't we more important? More important than 'finding things out'? Are you a cop, or what? I hadn't understood I knew you hadn't, you're so stupid Shall I tell you about Gautier? Gautier is very powerful He trades all over the world. He could snuff you out in five minutes So why did he give me 10,000 francs? To humiliate me, make fools of us You see, Gautier loves me Enough to let me live the way I want. Understand that? I was working on him I wanted him to accept you He'd have given me my freedom But now you've mucked it up. He's afraid for me He's a dangerous man now Understand now? Are you going to leave? You hurt yourself Get out Is that the lot? I LOVE YOU - What are you doing? - Packing - Where's Ariane? - I don't know any Ariane - Did Gautier send you? - He's Monsieur Gautier Tell me where Ariane is I don't want to fight, but where's Ariane? So many Jean Jaurés avenues Daddy, daddy... I want to show you something THE END
