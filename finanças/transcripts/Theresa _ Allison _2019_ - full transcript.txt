Uh... look, I know with what happened… What happened? Oh, uh, I mean, you know, the body and… Oh that? Don’t worry about that. Wait, what? Don’t worry about it. Happens to everybody. Okay, I’m confused. About? I mean... I just... I had the NYPD knocking down my door; raid my apartment and drag me here! And I’m pretty sure that they found the girl that was in my bathtub. I heard somebody say, “Holy shit, look, there’s a dead girl in the bathtub!” And? And?!? And nobody has asked me about how the body got there and nobody has interrogated me- Do you want to be interrogated? Well, no, but… There you go, then. Okay, so... I’m right back to being confused. So, I’m not under arrest or, you know, I’m not going to get taken in for experimentation. Experimentation? Why would we want to experiment on you? Oh... because, I’m... you know, one of the undead. Oh. Please don’t call it that. Well, I thought that was what it was called when I got the “dark gift” or whatever... Holy shit! Seriously, don’t say things like that. What else am I supposed to call it? What it is. You’re a fucking vampire! Deal with it! Goddamn it, Theresa! I told you not to do this! Do you remember that? I’m sorry! You’re sorry?!? Sorry’s not good enough! Sorry?!? Sorry’s not going to cut it because Cassidy and Susalyn are never going to invite you back again! And do you know how long I’ve been trying to get invited here?!? I said that I’m sorry, Mika. I just can’t deal with what her father does! He’s poisoning… Yeah, it’s all about you. Huh? You’re fucking unbelievable, do you know that? You’re unbelievable. Unbelievable. Just. Don’t talk to me anymore. Don’t. Okay? Come on. Jesus Christ. Really? Come on. Watch your head. I’m sorry. Can you just get her to this address? Sure. You owe me $30. Okay? Remember? You owe me $30. I don’t know. Venmo me or something when you get home. Thank you. Ummm... hello. Mr. Driver person? Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t see you there. I thought tonight was going to be a shitty night. Ow. Ow. That’s a little too hard. Ow! Ow! That’s too hard! Just stop please! Stop! Stop! No! Oh god! Please stop! Get the fuck off of me, please! The night’s not over yet. Wow. You really were drunk. I’m feeling that now. I was just thinking That when you don’t show up wherever you were going to go tomorrow, They’ll blame the cab driver for it. That’s how it always works out. And then every woman in the city will be afraid to take a town car for a little bit. Kinda funny when you think about it, huh? Help me! Please! Somebody help me! Help! Shhhhhh... Little Doe. You mustn’t scream or the Big Bad Wolf will hear you. Seriously. It’s almost a shame that someone as pretty as you is going to be in some fridge tomorrow. Some cold, impersonal city morgue, with a little tag on your toe like a Christmas present. Imagine a little kid opening up a Christmas present and it’s your corpse inside. That’s so funny! All warm and wet but tomorrow, it’ll be dry and cold. That beautiful soft skin of yours is going to crack and just rot off. These. Are just going to sag and wither. Even this pretty face of yours. Gone. Oh, Little Doe. You mustn’t cry. I can tell you’re afraid now. You don’t want to die, do you? Nobody does, Little Doe. Nobody does. Fuck it. 138! 138! Please report to office two. Now. That’s me! Alright then. Orientation time. First off, I’m sure until the moment you were made you had no idea we were real, right? Yeah. Well, we aim to keep it that way. I’m guessing since we only found one body at your place, That means you’ve left bodies in other places, right? Yeah. I was just... I couldn’t... chop up... just... No worries. Just fill out a form. We have people who handle that sort of thing. Here. This goes into the basic do’s and don’t’s. You know, sunlight, stakes, beheading, fire, all the things that kill us. Then there’s the things that are bullshit. Like not appearing in mirrors, being allergic to garlic, needing an invitation to enter someone’s home Being harmed by holy water and crosses. It’s really all bullshit, huh? That it is. Also, there’s some numbers in there to deal with our particular problems like… If you decide you don’t feel like killing anymore, we have blood banks set up all around the city, around most major cities, actually Where you can get blood from willing donors. I don’t know. What about feeding on rats and stuff? Why would you want to do that? I mean, that’s what they do in the movies. Just forget all those stupid movies and tv show. We don’t sparkle. We don’t turn into bats. We can’t fly and we can’t ride fucking moonbeams or whatever. You’re a physical creature of flesh and bone. Just with a longer lifespan than other creatures of flesh and bone. And a very particular diet. Little stronger, little faster. Can’t sunbathe. All the rest bullshit. Got it? Yeah, I got it. Oh, there’s also something in there about who to call if you encounter any problems from werewolves, demons, or other supernatural beings. Wait, werewolves and demons? Those things exist? Yes, said the vampire to the other vampire. Supernatural creatures are real. I know that may come as a shock to you, but surprise. In truth, though, there really shouldn’t be werewolves anymore. It’s completely treatable. Jesus Christ. Oh and don’t blog about this. Any of it. We’re monitoring that. Not even little subtle hints. Don’t start randomly quoting “Bela Lugosi’s Dead” or anything. Wait, who? Bless your ignorant little heart. Don’t worry about it. Just remember no one knows about us. I will say it again with extra emphasis. No one knows about us and if you tell people about us you will die, ‘kay? Okay! Can I help you? Hi. I’m Allison. Theresa. Saw you back at the office there. Was worried I missed you. Were you following me? Yes I was. Your perfume is really easy to track. Well, that’s pretty creepy. We’re hunters. We hunt. So, you’re new, huh? That I am. Well, you just got yourself a guide. So, what do you got there? That’s pamphlet Ms. Solenz gave me. It has all the do’s and don’t’s and stuff. I mean, have you read this? I think that it’s supposed to be a little bit sarcastic, just in case someone who isn’t one of us finds it. I guess that makes sense, but Oh, and this part that says you should learn hobbies that are difficult to master. What does that even mean? I dunno. I’ve had enough time to get really good at my Mandarin. Have you? Mmmhmm. So what do you say, do you know any other vampires besides the one who made you? I don’t even know the one who made me. Poor baby. Tell you what. Why don’t we take a walk? We’ll talk about it. Talk? Maybe some other things. If I didn’t know any better, Allison, I’d say you were flirting with me. And if I was? Well, the last woman who picked me up ended up tearing a pretty big chunk of my throat out by the end of the night, So thanks but no thanks! But that turned out better than expected, now, didn’t it? Are you hungry? No, not them. I’m trying to be careful about this. Are you sure? He’s AB Negative and she’s ovulating. Makes everything taste better. You can tell all that from here? You can’t? Sorry. You’re new. Sure I can. Pretty far out, huh? Don’t worry, you’ll be able to do it soon enough. They’re not that far from us. Oh, I’m doing it again, aren’t I? It’s so hard to keep up with what everyone’s saying now a days. If I wasn’t this, I’d be a grandma by now. How old are you? You’re going to make me do math? It’s not one of the powers that we get. What year? 1972 Okay so that’s 42- Whatever. It’s boring. Don’t be such a downer. We’re not supposed to be boring anymore. Now come on. Walk with me. So, you said you saw me back at the office? Yep. Do you work there? God, no silly. Not nearly old enough to work there. Everyone there is like a thousand years old or something. Seriously? Honest injun. Wow, that was kinda racist. Is that racist now? My mother used to use it all the time. It’s just a word. Anyway these rules are too boring and they change far too often for my tastes. I see So, if you don’t work there, what were you doing there? Me and my ex were kinda “bending” the rules. I thought they said if you bend the rules, they kill you. Bending, not breaking. If I was breaking, then I wouldn’t be standing here talking to you right now. Those guys don’t fuck around with that shit. So what rule were you “bending?” You’re new. You got a little weird about the whole injun thing. So, maybe it’s best that I not tell you. You may not think it was as bitchin’ as we did. Bitchin’? Is that not used anymore either? It’s so hard to talk to new people in my little vampire bubble. No, it’s cool. It’s okay. Ah, see you wouldn’t have thought it was as “cool” as we did. Alright, well, I get the feeling I shouldn’t talk about it anymore. Don’t worry about that any of that boring bullshit anymore. We are going to be young forever! There’s no reason for us to worry about anything anymore and now you have me as your guide! I’m going to show you the ropes! Be the Mickey to your Rocky! And… fuck… No, I understood that reference. Far out. Anyway, enough about me. It doesn’t seem like you are enjoying this much. It’s not that. It’s just... I can barely wrap my head around… Okay, here’s the thing. I took some self-defense courses before I moved here because I heard all the stories about New York. Ah, another transplant, huh? Yeah, Wooster, MA. Conchord, New Hampshire! New England, REPRESENT! So, you picked up fist bumping? Yeah, boy-ee! Okay, so as I was saying I took a couple self-defense courses in my freshman year and Someone comes at me I can, punch them out, you know, but otherwise Wouldn’t hurt a fly, huh? Oh no, I see a roach that fucker’s dead! I volunteered in college. I don’t really like violence. I’m a pacifist. What’s so funny? Boy, did you choose the wrong creature to become! You should’ve been like a unicorn or a pixie and then you could prance around the enchanted forest As you sprinkle pixie dust on all the little woodland creatures! This isn’t funny! In the last month, I’ve killed five people! Oh dear! A whole five?!? You realize you are just like Hitler, right? This is serious. I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m way over my head! I feel like shit about it! I think I might just try out one of those blood banks. I doubt you’re going to want to wait a whole 90 days to feed again. What do you mean? Takes 90 days for them to process the application. Are you fucking serious? Had a sister who applied for that. Took them 90 days before they let her into the program. Isn’t it like a blood bank or a soup kitchen or… God no. It’s a city program. It’s not like there’s a bunch of people with their necks out for you. Fuck! It’s part of the cycle, baby. The whole circle of life. Listen, I was made back in 1972 but it doesn’t mean I don’t go for a Brazilian once every four weeks. Ummmm….I’m sorry. By “Brazilian,” you mean a bikini wax, right. Not that you kill a Brazilian person, right? Want to see? No. Thank you. And you know, I’m not sure if that analogy actually works. You adapt! You adjust to your circumstances. You were one thing, now you’re something new. It’s not that easy! Don’t think about it. I can’t help that! Then I’ll help you. I have to ask you, if you’re like this, then why did the person who made you make you? I think I got her drunk with my blood. What’s burn- Who are- Oh, shit. I made you last night, didn’t I? Fuck. Well, you don’t want to be touching the sun now. Stop it! Christ, you’re being annoying. Look, I was really fucking drunk last night and I didn’t know I was going to have a guest this morning, so… You can stay here for the day but I want you out by the time the sun sets. No problem. I don’t want to be anywhere near you, after what you did to me! Did to you? You mean made you immortal? You tried to kill me last night! Whatever. Fine. Bathroom doesn’t get any sun. Feel free to sleep there if you don’t want to be near me. Oh, fuck! Wow. That’s pretty fucking far out. I mean… No, I get it. I know what you mean. That better So, not to interrupt, but you did say that it was five people? Yeah. No no no no no. Please please. Just wake up, please! Alright. Okay, um, okay. Drink. Just drink! Please! I’m so sorry about this. No no! Don’t feel bad! It’s what we are. I didn’t want to do what I did to the jogger. Never again. It’d been five days. Five days of me just sitting in my apartment. Smelling her get just riper and riper and I didn’t want to go outside because I was afraid of hurting somebody or attacking somebody. But I couldn’t stay in there with that smell anymore. You know, maybe if I went outside when the streets were empty and no one was outside, people would be safe from me. And then it just happened. Do it. You said you’d do it! Do it! Thank you. Thank you. It doesn’t have to be violent. I only need to feed when I feel the hunger coming on. And that makes it… Not horrible. Did you get a job at a suicide hotline? No, I’ve never met anybody who wanted to die... that directly but... Ugh. I hate feeding off of junkies! I have to be honest. I was kind of hoping that whatever was in her system would make me overdose So that all of this would be over. It’s good to know where you’ve come from. I am really glad that you came out tonight. Me too. My night was such a downer up until I saw you. Tony and I were- Toni. Is she your ex? Tony with a “y.” Yeah, he’s my ex. Wait, uh. I’m sorry. He? So, you’re normally into guys? Well, yeah, silly. But how things are and with us breaking up, I thought I’d try something new. Wait. So what am I? Just your vacation from dick? Don’t be like that. I think you’re great, but tonight has been traumatic enough without being somebody else’s Katy Perry moment. Theresa, baby! Don’t be like that. You know what? Maybe I’ll see you around. Theresa! Theresa, come on! Alright, listen! I have had a shitty enough night without some horny guy trying to get in my pants! On a normal night, I wouldn’t be into your equipment and tonight is not a normal night, so just please Back off! You have no idea what I could do to you! Yeah. That sounds like a challenge to me, actually. I’m serious! Fuck off before I hurt you! Hurt me? Wait. Oh my god. You can’t tell? Tell what? Seriously? Oh my god. Okay. Alright. Gimme a minute. Wait. What? So, you seriously couldn’t tell? Couldn’t smell me? Jesus, what are they teaching kids at the Hierarchy these days, man? The Hierarchy didn’t teach you anything? Allison didn’t teach you anything? How do you know Alli- Oh shit, you’re Tony, aren’t you? Allison talk about me? Look, whatever you’ve heard about Allison and I, it’s- Hey, hey, listen. If the little lady wants to have herself some fun of the sapphic variety, I’m totally cool with that. Listen, I’m not interested in just being her fun. Oh my god, you’re one of those! Bringing the U-Haul to the first date! Tell me, what’s your name? Theresa. You know, Theresa, I saw you earlier at the office tonight, when they were yelling at Allison and I Well, of course, then we started yelling at each other. So, you two literally broke up tonight? Broke up is a really harsh term. Besides, my “mom” will get really pissed off if Allison doesn’t show up to the party tonight. Party? What, like a vampire party? Uh yeah, like a vampire party. You’re telling me she didn’t invite you? Wow, that’s really cold, Allison. Geez. You know what? I’m just gonna go, okay? No no no no, no no baby girl, don’t go! Listen, just because Allison and I are taking a break does not mean that you and I can’t be close. I can’t think of a single reason why you and I can’t be friends. Oh you can’t think of one? Well, I can think of several! First of all, my name is not “Baby Girl,” it is Theresa. And second- Second of all, you couldn’t even smell me, which means you don’t know shit! Which means you probably need a guide. Because I’m willing to bet that’s only one of many problems you’re having. I bet right now, the world is a whole lot of white noise. You’re hearing all sorts of things you couldn’t hear before. Rain drops. Insects. Heart beats. And I bet when someone walks by, it’s like a whole herd of elephants right next to your ear. Been avoiding the subways, been avoiding midtown. Staying out of really populated areas I bet. And hey, listen, it’s okay. I know it’s scary. You must be going through hell. I mean, I had Allison. I had a “mom” to be there for me. Maybe what you need is someone to be there for you. Tell you what, come with me. I’ll keep my hands to myself and show you what you can do. Okay? This doesn’t have to be awful. This can be really, really wonderful, if you know how to use your abilities. So, what do you say? I’ll be good. Okay. Just seriously, hand’s off, okay? Scout’s honor. Now come on. No no no! There’s too many people! That is the whole point! You have to be in a place with a lot of people! My head feels like it’s going to explode! It’s too loud! Yeah. Close your eyes. Oh! You lured me here so you could- I didn’t lure you anywhere. Listen! This only works if you close your eyes first. I am trying to help you. If you try anything- I’m not going to try anything. So, you can either do this or I can leave and you can figure out all this shit on your own. Fine. Okay. Close them. Now, can you hear my voice above everything else? Barely. Alright. What I need you to do is focus and let everything else fade away. Just listen. Listen. Listen. Listen. Now, open your eyes. This is freaky! It’s this easy?!? Yes, it is, Baby Girl. I mean, Theresa. Let me show you something else. I want you to focus on these people. Now, Find one. Listen to them. Let yourself smell them, let yourself hear them, let yourself smell them, let yourself feel them. But just focus on one at a time, otherwise, you’re going to get overwhelmed. ‘Kay? Fucking prick! You’re not supposed to pay any attention to that. He doesn’t fucking belong here! Look at him! Wanna do some shots? She was supposed to be here two hours ago! I’m gonna have a couple more drinks! You have to calm down! I’m fine! I’m fine! Oh my god! They all sound different! They all smell different! Yeah, that’s scent. It’s a combination. Diet. Blood type. All that sort of shit. Eventually, you’ll be able to tell blood type from taste and smell, you know? Something to learn. Oh my god, I really can smell everything. I mean, I’ve been smelling little bits of pee on all the guys here, but that guy- Yeah yeah, okay. No no no. Don’t be smelling that guy. Why am I smelling little bits of pee on all the guys here? That’s not a debate we’re going to have. I haven’t peed in 42 years so- No wonder I don’t fuck you guys. If I really wanted to, I can point out some of the women here who aren’t smelling too fresh this morning- Oh come on! Can we talk about something else? Okay yeah That sounds like a wonderful idea! Music! Music! You’re not hearing the music right now, so Let’s focus on the most primal form. Drums. Vocals. Drum beat is like a heart. Find it. Okay. Now, let the other instruments fade in. Listen to the voice and just put it together like a skeleton. Parts become one beautiful whole Feels like I have super powers. Can I read minds too? No, you can’t read minds. Sucks. But now, that I’ve been kind enough to show you how to use your senses, do you smell what I smell? I dunno. What? What do you smell? Let’s think outside the box a little. Come on. Tell me what you see besides these people. I smell a lot of people outside the club. Uh huh? And someone outside in the alley behind the bar. She’s alone and she’s drunk as a skunk from how her blood smells, so go let’s get you a drink! Sorry. I’m not thirsty. I have a few days before I have to drink. And if I drink from her, I’m going to get drunk- Listen, grasshopper! The lesson is not yet over! Are you saying you don’t trust me? No, I’m not saying that. Okay, good! Because I was nice enough to go and help you here! Okay?!? Yeah, you were. You were. Good, so come on. Let’s go. It’ll be fun! Fuck! Fucking asshole! How could he do this to me?!? Fuck! Ma’am? Are you okay? No no no no. I’m not fucking okay. Fucking asshole. He took my fucking- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. You’re like, really, fast. That I am, but don’t worry, you’re safe with my friend and I. Check it out, Theresa, it’s another redhead. Something you and I have in common. What, you couldn’t tell she was a redhead by scent? No, Theresa, you can’t tell hair color by scent. That’d be stupid. What are you guys even talking about? Don’t you worry your pretty little head about it. Listen, your knight in shining armor is here and I’m going to help you. So, listen, first thing I need to know This guy, what was his name? Jimmy. Jimmy fucking Cesare! He took my fucking purse and then he hit me! Who hits a fucking girl?!? Who fucking does that?!? Who does that?!? Obviously, someone with a lot of issues. Yeah yeah yeah. Whatever. Where the fuck are my keys? Were they in my purse or- Whoa whoa whoa! Tony, what are you doing? Hey! Listen! Listen! I was just trying to help! I was just- He’s being a douche is what you were being! Tony, what are we doing? Is there a reason why we’re here?!? Of course there is. Hands off me! Check this out, Theresa! Tony! Tony, please stop! Tony, what the fuck?!? She’s still alive! Yes, she is! Please please please, please! Tony! Here! What the hell was that Tony? Why didn’t you finish her? Can you smell that? Can you smell the fear in her blood? Gives her blood a little extra flavor, don’t it? You’re so fucking fucked up! No, listen, there’s a lesson here. Okay... okay… What I need you to do is let her go and then I’ll show you how to track her using her fear. It’s a really useful skill to have. Oh yeah, I like to wear this, so you don’t look like you just murdered someone in an alley. I don’t want to die. It’s okay. It’s okay. What is going on? Why aren’t you chasing her? The whole point of me bringing you out here was so I could teach you how to do this, okay? Shut the fuck up, Tony! I’m so sorry about this... Son of a fucking bitch! Just close your eyes and think of somewhere nice. Somewhere you love. Somewhere beautiful. And I get to tend the rabbits! Stop, Tony, come on! I don’t know. Maybe you’re not smart. Maybe you’re not brilliant. Allison doesn’t really go for brains. But the red shit coming out of her neck means she is dying, okay? It doesn’t matter if you want to be Mother fucking Theresa and let her go, she is going to die in this fucking alley, so you should do what I tell you! I don't want to die. Close your eyes! Close your eyes because you’re going somewhere peaceful alright? Yeah, the Kings County Morgue is really fucking peaceful this time of night! So, stop being so fucking dramatic! My fucking god! Waste of a goddamn fucking evening! Shhhhh. It’s okay. Well, it’s about fucking time. Jesus. I can’t believe you made me do that. She was so scared. I know what it’s like to feel like that. Whatever, Gandhi. Listen, instead of complaining, maybe you should be saying thank you. Because now you don’t have to sit in your cave and wait for the people to go away. No! That was awful! That wasn’t me. I don’t want them to feel terror like that. You know, there’s a lot of good blood going to waste. You should probably do something about that. Yeah, I’ll hold. Fuck you! Fuck you! Seriously! Fuck you, you fucking psycho! 483-367 Yeah, uh, I’m in an alleyway off Troutman, between Irving and Wyckoff. Victim was arguing with someone named Jimmy Cesare. Yeah yeah. She was going on about how her purse was stolen. Yeah, final kill was done by me and... What’s your V-Code? Theresa somebody or other. She just ran off. Okay... Oh, okay. Thanks a lot. Yeah, cool. You have a good evening too. Thank you. Well… Waste not, want not. Can I ask you why the government hasn’t tried to hunt us down or experiment on us? Well, they recognize that we’re predators and predators have to hunt. As long as you’re registered and don’t step on the wrong toes and don’t let the general public know we’re around They’re perfectly okay with us hunting. Sorry, but why are they okay with that? Because there are rules; acceptable losses. Keep your kills private. Don’t feed on anyone you’ve been seen with. Don’t feed on anyone you know. Don’t turn anyone who will have a big mouth about it. Don’t feed on anyone who will be missed. Don’t feed on children- Whoa. Children? People will-we... we feed on little children? Let me tell you from personal experience, children are delicious. It’s like heaven in your mouth. Really? Oh my god, yeah! Especially babies. So, you have fed on babies? Why aren’t you in trouble? One of us was lucky enough to be born in a time of plague and abundant orphans. The other was born in a time of Amber Alerts and Nancy Grace, so stay away from kids. Not thinking that’s going to be a problem. Good. Because if it becomes a problem, we’ll kill you. Without question, without mercy, we will kill you. And if you think you’re going to get away with fucking with the rules, you will have another thing coming. Theresa! Excuse me. Theresa! What? No scent. You’re another vampire, aren’t you? Guilty as charged. I’m terribly sorry to disturb you. My name is Polina. Polina Volkova. Well, that’s great. That’s just fucking great. It’s just going to be an insane vampire parade. That’s my life now. I don't need to deal- Wait. Holy shit. You’re their mother, aren’t you? Excuse me. Tony and Allison. You’re their mother, aren’t you? No. Dear me, no. Far from it, in fact. I represent someone of great stature who would like to speak to you. I’m sorry. I don’t want to deal with this. I just want to go home. Ms. Costanza. It will only take a moment. We just want to talk. Wait... I didn’t tell you my name. All will be explained when you meet Her. I would offer you a drink but I can tell you have just fed. Oh, my sweet child Do not be embarrassed by what you are. I’ve been hearing that all night. Yes! But you have heard it from those who should be. Those who do not appreciate the gift they have. You ran into two of that Russian barbarian’s offspring. She, like her children, do not know of beauty. They do not know of the grace in what we do. But you do? Ah, the things I could show you, Theresa Costanza. The things I could show you. What about her? I serve a greater purpose. Before I met the Order, I was lost, but now I’m where I was always supposed to be My blood will feed La Reina and that’s all I need. If I can help her live one more day, even with my death, I have lived a good life. You see, Ms. Costanza? There are those who will give themselves to us willingly. We are not all animals like that Allison and Tony you met earlier tonight. He, especially... leave it to that graceful woman to allow one like him to become one of them. A man like him in Order would have been sport come Festival de Malandro A man like him would never taint my blood. Ms. Costanza, you should participate in the Festival sometime. It really is quite glorious. The predator becomes prey. We, those who love La Reina, become something more than ourselves. Something... Something more like her. Something divine. Also, it is quite the chance to let loose, shall we see. What do you want from me and why do you both know my name? Theresa Costanza, I know many things. La Reina was gifted with the second sight even before she ascended. My Order would embrace you. There would be no more struggle to feed. That would be nice. That wouldn’t just be nice, it would be an honor, Ms. Constanza! You are meeting with the high priestess of our order! Do you know how few receive an audience- She will learn, Polina! She will learn! What do you want?!? Information. It is, as they say, power. I have an enemy and that enemy made the two you met tonight. Them and many more. Many more who do not know of grace. My enemy, the Russian, she feels she has the right to get into my territory. But I am told I cannot move against her unless I want to start a war. No one wants a war. The Hierarchy wants us all to play nice. There is where I need you to become my eyes. Those two they will- I just want to go home. I think I just want to go home. I’m sorry. Theresa Costanza, are you giving up the chance to be under my protection? Giving up the chance to be a sister in my Order? I just want to go home. Get out of my sight. If you mention that you met me to Sakkara or any of her children, they will kill you. And if they don’t, I will! Then I will kill everything that you’ve ever loved! My name is never to be on your lips. Go! Alright. Alright! Okay, Alright, Jesus! Hi. What are you doing here? Are you tracking me again? Christ I just got done dealing with your crazy ex-boyfriend. You met Tony? Yeah! Listen, I don’t want to be part of your weird relationship drama. Okay, sorry. I didn’t know he was going to get involved with you. He didn’t hurt you, did he? No. He’s just fucking sleazy. How could you go out with a guy like that? He can be kind’ve sweet when you get to know him. Whatever. It’s really late. I’m just going to turn in. No no no no no. The sun doesn’t come up for another six hours! Really, I’m done for the night! Theresa, I really really like you! I’m sorry that we got off on the wrong foot and definitely sorry you had to deal with Tony. Can I come in? I thought vampires didn’t need permission to enter someone’s else’s house. We don’t. It’s just good manners to ask. Alright. Fine. Come in. Yay. Thank you! Hey, I like you. A lot. You’ve got a certain vibe about you, you know? I really like you too, Allison. I’m worried about just being your vacation from him. I just met you. I can’t commit to someone so soon. No, that’s not what I’m trying to say. Baby, let's just take things as they come. Okay? Oh, this feels so wrong. There’s no wrong for us anymore. I don’t want to live like that. So, there’s a party tonight. I know, Tony told me about it. Why don’t you come? Meet some more of your kind? Yeah, if they’re anything like Tony… Some of them are, but do remember that sister I told you about, the one who does the blood donations? Miranda always shows up to these things and she never seems to have any fun. Maybe the two of you will have something in common. Are you trying to pawn me off on someone else? No, baby, I want you all to myself. I just think maybe you could use a few more friends. Alright. Um... so where is this party? Westchester. Westchester? There’s no way we will be able to get there and back without the sun- It’s all taken care of. And it’s a nice place, with servants and everything. And it’s safe there. It’s all family. And you’re sure it’s okay if I come? Mmmhmm. Sorry to ask but is Tony going to be there? You won’t have to interact with him at all. I promise. You promise? I do. Okay. Alright. Fine. Can I go change into something a little bit nicer? You need any help? Not if you want to actually make it to that party. So, what do you think? It’s weird. I didn’t realize how little I’d be picking up when I was around all these other... well, you know… You can say vampires. Vampires. It’s like I’m not picking up any scents or anything. You’ll get to that in time. I guess. It’s a pretty mixed party. I wasn’t expecting this. Why? I dunno. Seems weird, is all. Aw. Fuck. Hey, Baby Girl! Hey Tony. And Indira Gandhi. Whatever. This is my ex and her beard. She’s decided she’s a lesbian since we broke up. Ladies, this is Aurora. She’s going to live forever. Aurora Nightshade. Obviously. Tony is going to usher me under the long, black veil. He’s going to initiate me into the world of the Brujah. And together, we will rage against the societal norms that Ventrue like yourself cling to. The Bru-wha? Do not mock our clan. I was born into darkness. Conceived under the Only Theatre of Pain. Not the Valor stuff. Never the Valor stuff. He is untrue. Do you have any idea what she’s talking about? Come along, Aurora. Let’s let the ladies wallow in their conformity. What the fuck just happened? I think that Tony stopped at Hot Topic on the way to the party. Is that some stupid attempt to make you jealous. I don’t know how it could be. Oh hey, Theresa, this is the sister I was telling you about. Hi Miranda. Hi Allison. There’s someone that I want you to meet. Thanks, but I have a lot of- This is Theresa. She’s new. Huzzah for her. Now, if you don’t mind, I have some inventory- No no no. I wanted her to talk to you. You guys are kind’ve alike. I’m sure we’re practically twinsies, but- She’s weird about the whole feeding thing. Oh. Hello Theresa. Hey. So you just got turned. Yeah. How long ago? About a month. So you are new. So I’m just going to let you guys talk. Allison, you said- So… Some party, huh? I guess. Where did you meet Allison? She actually followed me home from the orientation I had to go to. Oh, you mean the Hierarchy offices? Yeah, she and Tony were being bad. What did they do exactly? She didn’t tell you. I didn’t get specifics but if Tony was involved, I'm assuming it can’t be good. Tony isn’t even the worst one here. I take it you haven’t met Paisley yet. You mean like the garnish? No, that’s parsley. It’s Paisley, like the design or like the town in Scotland. There’s a town in Scotland named Paisley. Apparently so. But once you meet her, you’ll give serious thought to tanning. Wow. She’s really that bad, is she? You’ll see. Or hopefully, she’ll get in a car accident on the way here and you won’t. I guess. So, about the program? Yeah. Everything comes clean and packaged. It took me about 90 days to apply. Yeah. Allison told me it the 90 days thing I had to deal with doing some things I’d rather not talk about right now until then. I understand. Do you? I’ve fed on five people since I’ve been turned and it’s just… Really not my thing. Well, I’ll hook you up with the app for your phone. It automatically applies you and then reapplies you when the year’s up. You have to apply every year to prove that you’re not abusing the program in any way. I see. Uh, Can I ask you a question? No. Oh, okay. I was kidding. You asked me a question asking if you could... nevermind. What is it? Well, for my orientation, they mentioned something about other beings. Werewolves and demons and I don’t know. Did you ever met any of them? No really. Just other vampires. But hey, until I met our “mother” I hadn’t met any of our kind either. I am not sure why you mean by “our.” Mother. And who is this child? I do not smell any of my blood within her. I’m Theresa. Child, come with me. We must talk. So, you seek to come between my children? Whoa. Whoa. Wait, I- My Tony and my Allison. I found them together at Galaxy 21 and thought they should be together forever, so I made it so. Are you trying to tell me that you know better than I, who was born before your grandmother’s grandmother’s grandmother? No no no. That’s not at all what I’m trying- Do you know of poetry? Do you know of love? Love between predators? I know what it’s like to be in love. I… You know the love of a little girl. The love of a school child who feels her heart thump for the first time. I speak of love passed through blood. Passed through time. Birth is painful. Always. Always, is it painful. Yet, I do not smell any of me within you. I cannot tell whose child you are, but you are not one of mine. Listen to me for just a minute! A minute she asks for. What is that to a god? Do you ask a second of the wind? To fire? To earth? To water? Do you know what these eyes have seen? Know she will never be yours! Just, please, lady. Sakkara! Okay, alright... Sakkara… Did you give Tony the same lecture for his wanna-be Morticia? Oh, you are an innocent, yes? Oh, I see. Much you do not know of this world. Much you have yet to learn, yes? I don’t get it. Go. Go, pleasure my daughter. Perhaps you learn a little of what you are tonight, yes? Uh... thank you for your blessing. I don’t think your “mom” liked me very much. She doesn’t have to. It only matters that I like you. This has all been like some crazy fucking dream, you know? I hope you’re not planning on waking up anytime soon. No. It’s just… Some things have been terrifying but Some other things have just been beautiful. That’s what our life is. We can do whatever we want to. And we have all the time in the world to do it. All we have to do to get it is… Is that really so bad? Yeah, it is for me. Well, Miranda will help you with that if it really bothers you so much. It’s just nature, you know? I mean, do you blame a lion when it kills a lamb? Yeah, but we’re not lions. But we’re also not... people. Not really, not anymore. I know you still feel like one. You still look like one. But we’re different from them now. I have a lot of trouble believing that. People get sick. People grow old. People smell and pee and poo and they rot away. But we are going to be beautiful, forever. Forever, Theresa. If I wasn’t made this, what would I be now? Some New England grandma, sitting in a nursing home, unloved? Old, ugly. My nurses being mean to me when my diaper needed to be changed. Probably looking back in regret at taking that bus to New York, thinking I was going to be Linda Lovelace, and that Tony was going to make me a star? That’s where I’d be right now. Forgotten. Probably even dead by now. I was doing a lot of blow back then. But look at me now, 40-something years later, and I’m still young and beautiful. People still turn their heads when I walk down the street. Hell, you want me, don’t you? You know I do. But would you if I were an old woman? I don’t mean to get too much of a head trip on you, you know, but would you really want me if I were just old, broken down Allison Crandel from Concord? It’s just the cycle of life. Some things have to die so that other things can live. That's... Plants feel pain. You know that, right? So, even the gentle animals out there in the fields eating grass and leaves and shit They’re still feeding on something alive to live. You can’t get around it. No matter how hard you try. And we can go wherever we want to. Just the two of us. Go ahead. Name a place for me. Name someplace you’ve never been before. I’ve never been to Spain. Then we’ll go to Spain. Barcelona. And then maybe Paris or Berlin or Tokyo or wherever. We can go wherever we want to. And there are arms wide open for us, wherever we decide to go. There’s so much beauty in the world for us. The world was made for us. We’re the only ones around long enough to see everything. Except the day time. Well, after we’ve seen everything there is to see. And we’re all riding around on flying cars and all the cities are in domes and we’ve been to Mars, we can go and watch the sunrise together and the last thing we see is going to be something beautiful. You make it all sound so... clean. It’s a small price to pay. Eventually, you don’t even feel guilty about it. Trust me on that. I think I’m gonna go take a shower. I know, I laid some heavy shit on you today. But at some point you’re going to have to accept what you are. Or you’re going to just have to decide maybe it’s time to say hi to the big yellow bitch in the sky. Are those the only two ways this goes? Think I’m going to stay in here for a bit. I’m gonna go take a shower. Alright. What are you typing? Inventory. I run a vintage clothing store off Avenue A. Kinda appropriate. Would be if I were made in the 1850’s. I was born in 1982 and turned in 2010. I’m the second youngest in this little... well, I guess if you want to call it a “family.” Only one younger is Paisley. So, why do you run a vintage clothing store? Because money is required to exchange goods and services. Just because I drink blood doesn’t free me from the joys of Capitalism. So, you know... I noticed that only half the people here are vampires. We are the real 1 %. But nobody here seems to be quiet about it. I mean, Tony over there just told that girl that he was going to make her one of us. Oh. You really don’t get it, do you? Get what? You didn’t notice all the security getting in here? The giant fence around the property? The dogs? Yeah, I thought... Allison told me this was a safe place. For us, it is. Almost everybody who isn’t one of us isn’t getting out of here alive. I mean, come on, you’ve met Solenz. Can you imagine if Tony brought that girl into the Hierarchy Offices? She’d stake him on the spot. I think I feel ill. I can’t believe... I feel like such a bitch for making fun of that poor girl! We need to get them out of here! We need to tell somebody! Your heart is in the right place and I’ve been where you are, but you’re just going to cause a panic and get them all killed sooner. Trust me. What about the lake?!? You didn’t swim all the way out to the other side. Lined with barbed wire and there’s guards on the shore. This is so fucked up. Wait, then what are you still doing here? Sakkara’s still the one who made me. Even if I don’t like what’s going on, I still come, just to keep the peace. That is fucked up and you know it! I don’t disagree. But do you think you or I, or even us both, could fight our way through here? What about the butlers- Slaves. Occasionally, Sakkara will pick out a few that she likes and give them the option of serving for life or dying here. I take it you haven’t seen the basement. No. What’s in the basement? Well, besides the fucking oven she uses to burn all the bodies from her little parties… There goes avoiding a panic. I’m sorry to do this to you, but I’m allergic to Paisley. Alright, bitches! I brought tonight’s entertainment! Oh, for fuck’s sake. Is that who I think it is? Everybody, I want you to meet... uh... whatever. Her name isn’t important. All that matters is that she’s mine now. She was rude to me and now she has to be punished. Jesus fuck, Paisley! You actually went and got the goddamn salesgirl? Yes, I did. You don’t talk to me like that. This isn’t one of your fucking rich daddy’s lawsuits! You have to be more careful with this sort of thing! About a month ago, Paisley was bitching that she went to buy some shoes and the salesgirl who worked there was rude to her. Yup. And tonight, she’s going to learn that the customer is always right. Isn’t that right? You’re my little piggy now, aren’t you? Somebody help me! Fuck this. Please! Somebody help me! Somebody help me! I don’t wanna die! No! Just don’t! I’m sorry to have to do this to a fellow creature of the night, but I demand that you let her go! This is nonconsensual and She has the right to say no! You are so precious! What’s your name, darling? Aurora Nightshade! I am a fellow child of the night like yourself. Are you now? Yes, I am, but this must not continue. I understand the need and the hunger to feed but if this was merely about feeding, I wouldn’t dream of standing in your way A child of the Toreador with her mortal prey. But this is about sexual assault and we are above that! We are? Yes, we are, my sweet sister in crimson! And I’m sure you’re aware of the Sanguinomicon! And all the vast amounts of pleasure that are there to be had and desires to be quenched- You are so cute. Mwah! What the fuck, Paisley?!? Oh, was that yours? I didn’t even get a chance to fuck her! Oh, whatever, Romeo. Why don’t you fuck my new pet instead? Yeah, what really want I want to do is fuck your hyperventilating crying- Paisley, she is peeing on the floor! Sakkara’s gonna be upset. Somebody get me a rolled up newspaper. Oh man, that’s so funny! You know what’d be even funnier? If I killed your little pet! You let her go! She’s mine! You know what? You killed the one that was mine. It’s only fair! She has to live and suffer for what she did! I don’t give a fuck what she did! You want her to live, so maybe it’s time for you to learn that you don’t always get what you want! Fuck you! Fuck me? Fuck you! Fuck me? Fuck you! Fuck me, huh? Enough! Enough! Both of you! But she- This arguing, I will not have in my home, between my children! Paisley, the girl now belongs to me. But- There will be no buts. The girl is now mine, to do with as I please. I will let you seed her, though. You best get a good vintage out of her or I will show you what it means to be punished, understood? Yes… Yes, ma’am. Good. Now, Tony, you are out an offering, but you should pick one from the room. Paisley will make it up to the one whose offering you take. This one’s not as pretty as Aurora was, but I think she’ll do. You should be glad. All the others, they will die tonight. You... if you can please my “son” with what you have between your legs, you may wake up tomorrow. Now, strip and pleasure him. I do not want that thing rotting in my home. Take it to the ovens. Now, I will be in my room. Let this charade end. Feed as you will. Well, you know what to do. Get to whipping it out, come on! Now, I feel like getting drunk. You, drink! Are you fucking kidding me?!? Darling, in about a half hour, I’m going to tear your throat out with my teeth. You’re going to die. Right here. And there’s nothing you can do about it, so if you want to, at least, not feel it, You better start chugging right the fuck now! Drunker you are, the less it’s going to hurt! That was fucking horrible! You know, Paisley’s daddy pretty much paid for her to become one of us. What? Fucking rich oil asshole. Congressman. One of the few who actually knows about us. Some shit went down at Port Authority last year, after the eclipse and the blackout. I don’t really know what happened, but he pretty much said that he was going to come down on us hard If we didn’t do something about his sweet little girl who had a brain tumor or some shit. So, you’re telling me that that monster in there was sitting and dying in a hospital bed And now she’s this? No, from what I can tell, Paisley’s always been that way. Tumor slowed her down a bit, made her bed-ridden, but she’s always been a terrible fucking person. I think that’s why my mom decided to turn her in the first place. She wanted to see what would happen if someone who was already a monster became one of us. That and the suitcase full of money probably helped. What is that smell? The basement. You never did tell me what was in the basement. Are you sure you want to know? Wait. Oh my god, is that what I think it is? Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my fucking god! You wanted to see it. What about the rules?!? They said we’re not allowed to feed on kids! They were very specific about that! No one is going to miss child that nobody knows about except for the ones who bred it. Honestly, that’s what they’re probably doing to the salesgirl back there. Have enough of the male servants fuck her until she gets knocked up and when she’s ready to pop, Sakkara will serve up her baby like it’s a Chateau Margaux. This is the most horrifying thing I’ve ever… This is who you are now. Did you think the rules were to protect them from us? The rules are there to protect us from them! If the average person knew what monsters we were, they’d rise up and kill all of us. It already happened once. Stalin did it after World War II. He purged the Soviet Union of all of us. Sakkara was there You should hear her go on about it. That’s why the good ol’ U. S. Of A. Had no problem working with us. We’re enemies of Communism. Help me! Please, help me! Please help me! Why aren’t you helping me?!? Please! Please! Please! Oh, hey! Hi, Miranda and whatever your name is. I know this isn’t like your thing and I’m trying to respectful of that. So, I’m going to take her out of here. So sorry. You keep doing what you’re doing. Don’t mind me. So sorry about this. Let me go! Shut the fuck up! Hey, everybody! Look what I got! I think I’m going to be sick. There’s nothing in you to throw up. You have to stop kidding yourself. This is who you are. What about you? Isn’t this who you are too? Theresa, let me tell you about the best feeling I’ve ever had. The most wonderful euphoric joy Was the last time I saw my parents. I didn’t mean to. I had held back for so long that Iost control. I fed on them and it felt good. Feeling their fear, tasting their blood. It was amazing... And then, I saw what I had done and I couldn’t live with myself anymore. I went outside that morning to go lay out in the sun, so I’d die and I wouldn’t have to face what I was. So, why are you still here? It rained. For four days straight. And by the time it was done, I realized that just because I was a monster, but I didn’t have to act like one. I applied for the donor program immediately. How did you survive those three months? Do you know how easy it is to find a would-be rapist in this city, if you really want to? I figured if I was going to feed, I’d feed on scumbags. Twelve less predators in the world... and... and then I never fed again. I want to be like that. And yet, you want to be with Allison. What do you mean? Allison has killed more people than Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, and Henry Lee Lucas combined. You could probably fill a concert hall with how many people she’s killed. I didn’t tell you from before what she and Tony got in trouble for, did I? No, you didn’t. Do you remember the Tsunami in 2004? You might have been a teen during it, but there was an earthquake in the Indian Ocean. A 9.0. Triggered a tsunami… I vaguely remember my parents watching it on the news. Around that time, Tony and Allison took a trip to Thailand. Why? There were an awful lot of orphaned children after the Tsunami. What? No…how is that “bending” the rules? I think you know the answer to that. No one will miss those kids. As it was, there were regular businessmen, taking their pick for kiddie porn and slavery. So Allison and Tony were just two more invaders. But the Hierarchy got pissed off that they were so close to a news story. That’s…That’s horrible. She’s a monster, Theresa. So are you. So am I. It’s whether or not you act like one that matters. You can apply for the donor program, but don’t forget what you are, because if you do, that’s when you’ll really hurt the ones you loved before... this. Come on! Rut! Fucking rut! You fucking pigs! Huh. That’s the kind of ass the Puerto Rican guys like. Paisley! Christ! What?!? They like big asses! They write songs about it, dumbie! When he’s done, you’re next. Oh, phone! Come on, honey give us a smile! Come on! Give us a nice little smile! Fine. Be that way. Bet you that you break before I get bored. How can you do this? I don’t want to be like this. How can you be such fucking monsters?!? You used to be just like them! Someone need some ointment for her butthurt? Little girl thinks she’s better than all of us. Princess, even when I was like them, I still would’ve laughed my ass off when I made you eat your own shit. You wouldn’t have even been the first. So, you better thank your lucky fucking stars that some dumb bitch met you and decided to turn you, because if I found you, instead, you’d be doing little doggy tricks, like that little shit Remember, honey: just because you’re one of us now, doesn’t make you one of us. You fucking cunt! Oh, ladies! Ladies, ladies. Listen as much as I’d love to see a cat fight, Allison told me she has a present for you. You should go see what it is. Why should I fucking trust you? This is just going to be some goddamn trick. Oh, you know what I’m hurt. Because really, after all those powers I was nice enough to give you, you act this way towards me? I mean, hey, if you want Butch over here to rip your fucking head, then that’s fine. Otherwise, no trick. Allison told me she has a present. Honest Injun. What the fuck, Allison?!? What the hell are you doing? Baby, been waiting for you. Look I got you a present. Isn’t she pretty? I was going to put a giant pink bow on her head but I thought she looked better naked. They always do. Besides, it’d be silly to put a tuxedo on a hamburger, right? This is what you wanted to show me? This is what Tony said I had to see? Allison, this is... this is bullshit. She is a person! I don’t want to be like this. I don’t want to be like those monsters down there. And why are you even talking to him still? I thought you two broke up! Don’t worry about Tony. Just come here and see what I’ve gotten for you. No, I can’t do this. I'm not down for this. You know what Miranda was right about you! Oh, Miranda is so melodramatic. Eventually, you’ll learn to ignore her, just like everyone else. Besides, the sun’s coming up. If you go out right now, you’ll be killed. I... I don’t think I care anymore. I think... I think... I want to see the sun, one last time. Baby, it would kill me if something happened to you. Just come back inside. What? Just a taste. A little taste. You don’t like it, I’ll find you someplace safe to sleep until the sun goes down. Besides, if she tastes anything like her sister or cousin over there, you’re in for a treat. No no! No, Allison, don’t! Let her go! Stop, let her go! Please, Allison! Oh, it tastes so… This is so wrong. There’s no wrong for us anymore. Just what we want when we want it. For however long we want! I don’t want to be like- Stop going through the motions and start being what you are! Hey... hey, mom. I know. No, I’ve just... I’ve been sick. I know it’s been a month but I’ve been sick this whole... I don’t know about those classes. I might just drop them. I’ll have to see. No, Mika and I broke up. Yeah, I know. Thanks mom. Uh no please don’t visit just yet. I have all these finals to… Seriously, don’t come visit. I have my finals to do and then I may- I know. Thank you. I love you too. No no nothing’s the matter, mom. Give my love to dad and Matt okay? Oh god! You’re not in the basement yet! No, it’s good! It’s good! They’re still asleep! They’re still asleep! If you just- Theresa! Come back to bed! Come on. Come back to bed. Hey! Hey! Thank you so much for changing your mind. We understand how hard this must have been for you. The last time we met, you were understandably upset. But it’s good to know that you’ve seen that La Reina’s way is the only way that this gets resolved. I knew she was coming back. Didn’t I tell you? The mirror does not lie. I knew she would eventually see things our way. There is nothing good that can come of being associated with Sakkara. All that bloodshed. All that madness. You must be tired of that. She is. She told me herself. Last time we helped her. I am sure she remembers. How could you forget something like that? How long was that? Ninety days, while you waited for the program to kick in? Polina, I am sure the girl can speak for herself. So, my dear, would you be the eyes that we ask for? You will help us know the moves of the usurper and her children? Yeah. I’ll help you. I’m not joining your Order or anything, but I can’t do this shit anymore. I think the last straw for me was that girl, Theresa. That night- There there. Soon, it will all be over. Order will overcome chaos. We have a goddess on our side.
