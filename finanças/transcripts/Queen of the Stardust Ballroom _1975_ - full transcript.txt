You could have your own room. - The girls would just love it. - I've never lived any place except the Bronx. - What is so terrific about the Bronx? - Just a big slum! - That's the reason we moved out here. - I've lived there all my life. - Then it's time for a change. - It'll be so lonely for you Ma. - It'll be lonely for me any place without your father. - Here at least you'd have the kids. - All right I'll think about it. - Oh sure. We don't expect you to make a decision immediately.

I came down here and I looked around and I said to myself Bea God is trying to tell you something. I'm gonna open a junk shop. - God told you to open a junk shop huh? - Why not? - Ma opening a store is not an easy thing. In fact it's very complicated. - Oh I know dear but you'll help me. - Oh sure Ma. - I already called a lawyer and he's working on it. - Ma look you know I want what's best for you right? - The mind is made up. - Okay.

First thing she says to me when I walk in the door tonight is let's take Bea out for Chinese food. Bea loves Chinese food. - So? Don't you love Chinese food Bea? - Well there you are. What do you expect me to say? No let's have Italian because I'm in the mood for Italian tonight? Bea loves Chinese food so much I could be big about it can I? - What so if that's the case why haven't you stopped complaining since we got here? - Complaining? Who's complaining? Was I complaining? - Come on. Bea was he complaining or not? - [Jack] So there you are. - I bought this in 1942. Just after the war started. It was considered a Joan Crawford style. I remember my husband always used to say he thought it was better on me than Joan Crawford. - Do you think it's me? - I think it looks better on you than me or Joan. - Do you really think so? - I wouldn't say so if I didn't mean it. - Bea what do you want for this? - [Bea] Oh that's not for sale. - Oh sorry. - It's so expensive. - 15 dollars expensive for a dress like that? - Well it's expensive for me. Natalie what do you think of it? - Turn around. I like it. - It's 15 dollars. - How much would you like it to be? - What? - How much can you spend for it? - Oh Bea no. - No come on. - 10? - It's yours. - Really? - I want you to have it.

So? - So let's grab a cup of coffee or something. - What is it? - We have some news Bea. - News? Oh dear. If it's what I think it is I couldn't be happier. - No Bea I'm not pregnant. - You're not. - No. - Oh. - We're moving. - You're moving? - To California. - California? - UCLA offered me an assistant professorship Mom. They have one of the finest English departments in the country. - California's the other side of the world. - [David] It's only five hours by jet. - We thought you'd be happy for us Bea. - Oh of course I'm happy for you. It's myself I'm feeling sorry for. - [David] Ma this was your ambition this shop. You have yours and you know this is what I need. - California? (melancholy music) (cooing) (cooing) - Here help me feed my birds. It's something to do. And the birds appreciate it. (cooing) (phone ringing) - Hello? Hello Diane. How are you darling? How's Louie and the kids? Good. I had a letter from Jennifer yesterday. They found a house finally. They seem very happy. I'm all right Diane really I am. Don't worry about me so much. No no I don't hear from him. Well they were daddy's friends more than mine really. I wouldn't feel comfortable with a group of married people anyway. Yes darling. Yeah I'll be out on Saturday after I close the shop. No I'll take the train. Why should he drive all the way up to the Bronx and then have to go back to the island? That's silly. No I'm taking the train period. Yes dear thank you for calling. I love you too and the children. Goodbye. - What's new Bea? How's business and every other little thing? - Business is good. Every other little thing could be better. - I knew it. You can't hide sadness. - My son's in Los Angeles my daughter's in Long Island my husband's in the ground. Sometimes I wonder what it's all about. - Excuse me. What can I do for you? - I'll have the bacon lettuce and tomato on toast. - BLT down. Coffee? - Please. - Bea can I ask you a personal question? - Ask me. - Are there any men in your life? - Men? - Yeah men you never heard of them? - I'm an old woman. - What? - I had one man in my life and he's gone. - Bea take it from me life begins when your husband dies. - What? - You didn't know me when my husband was alive. I was dead. Honest to god I was breathing I was existing but I was really dead. I looked dead I felt dead. The day he dropped dead I was born. (laughing) Bea? Do you like dancing? - Dancing? - Yeah ballroom dancing. Waltz Rumba Tango that kind of thing. - Oh as a matter of fact I used to be a pretty good dancer. That was a long time ago when I was a girl and New York was a prairie. - Do you ever go to the Stardust? - What's the Stardust? - It's a ballroom. I go there all the time. It's a terrific place for old girls like us who are young at heart. It's a very nice crowd. You ought to come with me sometime. No really. It's a terrific band everyone has a ball. My regular partner is Johnny Cantell we call him Johnny Lightfeet because he's light on his feet. - He really is he's the greatest. - Martha's got a terrific dance partner too. - Petey? - Of course Petey who else? I tell you this one is a real ding-a-ling. - I have a lot of partners Angie. - But Petey's your regular isn't he? - Not really. - Oh he is too. Tell Bea what we all call Peter. - The nose. - Oh wait till you see the schnozz on that character but what a dancer. - He really is. - Are you okay Bea? You're so quiet. - I guess I'm a little nervous. - Nervous there is nothing to be nervous about. It's a nice easygoing crowd. - It really is they're great. - Tell you one thing I wish you'd let me do something with your hair. - My hair? - Yeah maybe give it a little style or something. - Angie's terrific with hair. - Turn around. Have you tried Dolores the hairdresser next to the luncheon there. Tell her to give you a little red or blonde or something. - I'm not ashamed of getting old. - My philosophy is if you look young you feel young. - My husband didn't approve of dyed hair. He liked the natural look. - Since when do husbands know what's good with their wives? - That's for sure. - Martha should know. She's been married how many times? - Three. - Well I thought it was four. - Three. - All right all right don't hit me. - You lovelies. Thank you thank you. - This is it Bea. You're gonna have yourself a real ball tonight mark my words. (light ballroom music) - I've been waiting for you gorgeous. - Oh.

They're playing our song gorgeous. - I'll see you later girls. - Petey sells appliances. If you ever need a refrigerator or anything like that he'll get it for you at cost. I mean it's like a family. If someone runs a business he gets sales wholesales into customers. Come on I'll buy you a drink. - Angie! - Shirley I'm glad you're back. - Oh I'm feeling much better now Angie. - This is Bea. - Pleased to meet you Bea. - How you doing? - I'll see you later Shirley.

What's the matter? - What have you done to yourself? - Oh my hair. - Your hair your face everything. Ma you look ridiculous. - Ridiculous? - Have you lost your mind? - I dyed my hair and put on some makeup that's all. - That's all?

But don't blame me if Louis and the girls are shocked when they see you. - They're not gonna see me tonight so you have nothing to worry about. - What do you mean? - I told you I have other plans for the weekend. - You mean you were serious? - Of course I was serious. - Ma you've always come for the weekend. I mean the girls are expecting you. - I have a date. - A date? - Yes with someone who appreciates the way I look. - You just lost your husband Ma. - That was 13 months ago. - I don't even know you Ma. - Maybe not. - Can you break your date? - I don't want to. - Well that is just lovely mother. - Diane! - What? - You didn't kiss me hello or goodbye. Come here and give your mother a kiss. - I'm just furious with you. - Come here to me I said. Oh Diane. Something wonderful is happening for me. I feel alive again don't hold it against me. - Ma the kids. - They'll understand if you explain it to them properly. And don't tell them I look ridiculous. Tell them I look like a movie star. 'Cause that's the way I feel. - Bea tell me that god's honest is this dress too short for me? - Oh it's terrific. - You sure I'm not too old to wear it? - If I had your figure even I'd wear a dress that short. - You're a doll. - Bea have you seen Petey? - He's not in here. - Oh where the hell is he? We have to get ready for the peabody. - Does anybody have any green eyeshadow? - Yeah I have some. - Uh can I borrow it?
