[fanfare] [dramatic orchestral music] [slow orchestral music] That's about all the mules to pack, I think. [speaks Spanish] How much do you figure it comes to, SeñorDouglas? Roughly $16,000. Mm, not a fortune, but it means much to us at the moment, no? So much so that I'm wondering whether it's safe to ship it. Safe, of course not. Not so long as the White Mask and his gang are in the district, but we ought to continue work. We must have the money to meet the payrolls and other obligations, so. I thought you were making a shipment of bullion when I heard you'd come out here this morning. I judge you do not approve. Well, how can I approve when The White Mask has grabbed every shipment we've made in the last few months? I'm sorry, unfortunately my orders have been given. Well, haven't I anything to say about it? After all, I own half of the mine. Your father was my partner and my best friend. Yes, and he was killed taking in just such a shipment as this. I have tried to be a second father to you and guard your interest as I've promised him. But if you do not approve, perhaps I can find the money to buy your share of the mine. Oh, I'm sorry, Papacito. But couldn't we hold off making the shipment until we get help from the authorities? That's got a lot of sense, Don Sebastian. I have already told you there are reasons I cannot explain which prevent me from sending for help. Aw. You are not angry with me, querida? Oh, you know I'm not. I'm just mad at things in general. But I'll ride it off on my way back to the hacienda. [ominous music] I think I had better follow her and try to make up. That's not a bad idea. Take two of the men, unpack those mules. Send the rest of 'em back to work. But, señor,Don Sebastian will be angry if I-- Forget it. I have a hunch The White Mask is gonna lay for this bullion. -But, señor-- -No worry. I'll ride over and square it with the Don. [suspenseful music] Come on. SeñorDouglas, you forgot to leave the key to the vault! -[bright orchestral music] -[man] "Mina de plata." Mm, I'm sure glad to see that sign. I've been starvin' for hours. Say, can you read that? Why, sure, it's easy. "Mina"means, uh, minnows, and "de plata," well, just what it says, a plate-a. Put 'em all together-- a plate of minnows. Or as we say in Texas, a fish dinner. I see. What does "entrada prohibida"mean? Entrada probibida... Entrada prohi... Entire prohibition. But I don't care as long as they got plenty of coffee. I didn't know you could read Spanish. Why, sure, it's simple. -I'll teach you some even. -Good. [gentle orchestral music] [speaking Spanish] What does he say, Patches? You mean, what's he sayin', huh? Well, I don't know, he doesn't speak my dialect. I speak Castilian, he speaks a lotta c-c-castanets. Oh, I see. [speaks Spanish] [speaks Spanish] Say, I didn't know that you spoke Spanish. Oh, I don't. I just speak a little castanets. My friend here says we can't get in unless we get a pass from the boss. Oh, we can't, eh? Oo-day oo-yay en-may eak-spay a little English, eh? Oh, you don't, eh? Let's see, I've gotta-- Where is that? Oh, yeah. Tell 'em that's a pass, but it's written in English. [speaks Spanish] [speaks Spanish] Gracias, señor. I always knew that laundry ticket'd come in handy some day if I didn't pay it. [suspenseful music] They're not gonna make this shipment, they're unloadin' the mules. That makes it easy, if we don't miss the first shot. -[gun fires] -[dramatic orchestral music] You missed, you fool. Now we gotta fight. [guns firing] They sure celebrate Fourth of July early down here. That's not firecrackers, my friend. Come on. -[guns firing] -[dramatic orchestral music] Well, now that we got good seats, looks like the fight's all over. Not if we can make ourselves look like two or three men a piece. Well, you may be triplets, but there's only one of me. Now, you keep outta sight, and don't shoot twice from the same spot. Oh. [guns firing] They're gettin' up in the hills, men! Get 'em outta there! There's plenty of 'em, men, let's clear out! Come on, Luke is getting the pack horse. White Mask. Maybe we can catch him. You can have him, I don't like him. We ain't got a Chinaman's chance of catching him up in them rocks. I know, but maybe we can find out something about him from this fella. He's not hit hard. Come on, let's get him outta here. I feel like somebody's shootin' at me from every bush. So do I. Gimme a hand. [gun fires] Oh. Looks like that last shot got him. I'm afraid so. We'll get him back to the mine, do what we can for him. Here, I'll hold him, you get the horses. [suspenseful music] We was tricked, there's only two men shootin'. Yeah, they're in the road below. I want you to follow 'em, see where they go, and if possible, see that they bother us no more. I had hoped he'd come to long enough so he could tell us something about that White Mask hombre. He has to lock out the demonios. Who shall I tell Don Sebastian saved his silver for him? Just a couple of saddle tramps, riding through looking for work. Say, you can talk plainer than that. I thought you told me we was comin' down here on a vacation. I know, but the vacation ends when you find a job. But I'm all run down. I need a rest. After what happened today, I think Don Sebastian will be glad to give you work, señores. Ah, but we're far too proud to accept charity, far too proud. That's right, but we're not too proud to accept a job. Where do we find this Don Sebastian? Follow the trail down the arroyo, señor. You cannot miss it. That's what you think. I never saw a job yet I couldn't miss. [laughs] [suspenseful orchestral music] [birds chirping] Hey, isn't that a girl down there? One of 'em is. The other one looks more like a steer to me. She looks like she could use a little help. Well, what are we waitin' for? Rope Them McQuilt they call me from coast to coast, border to border. [dramatic music] Doggone, if you two hadn't have gotten in the road, I'd have caught that steer! You couldn't catch the measles unless someone held 'em for ya. Slack off on your rope, we won't run away. I'm sorry, miss, I hope it didn't hurt ya. -Jean! -Larry Prescott! Am I glad to see you! Say, do you two know each other? Yeah, Jean's father used to be my captain when I was in the Rangers. Well, whaddya know? Miss Malone, my friend Patches McQuilt. He does? -No, he is. -Oh. [laughs] -How do you do? -How do you do? Well, whaddya think of that? Meetin' the daughter of a friend's friend way out here. That's what I call coincidental c-c-coincillence. Well, it wasn't quite like that, I wrote Larry, told him there's a job here that was right in his line. Uh-oh, I've been tricked. Nobody said nothin' to me about a job no time. You're going to like this job. We're down here to clean up The White Mask and his gang. Oh, that's different. What? T-The White Mask? Why don't you get the police or an army or somethin'? Well, Don Sebastian won't let me. -Why not, Jean? -I don't know. He says he has reasons, but he won't tell me what they are. Is your mine the only property that's been raided? So far as I know. I wonder why. Has anyone tried to buy your mine cheap? Uh-uh. Well, Don Sebastian offered to buy my share this morning, but that doesn't mean anything. Mm, it doesn't. Let's ride over and have a talk with him. Maybe there's more to this than you think, Jean. Larry, you don't mean you think that Don-- I don't think anything yet, but I aim to find out. [suspenseful music] [man speaks in Spanish] [José speaks in Spanish] I cannot help but feel you overstepped your authority in countermanding my order to ship this silver bullion. Well, I'm sorry, Don Sebastian, but I had a presentiment The White Mask was gonna attack-- I do not believe in presentiments. You'll return to the mine and stop the shipment-- Don Sebastian, may I enter, please? Pase,José. I bring news from the mine, señor. -It was attacked-- -Attacked? Si, señor, by The White Mask, shortly after you leave, señor. They got away with the silver? No, señor,two Americanos came to help us and together, we drove off the banditos. Oh, my hunches aren't so bad after all, are they, señor? Sit down, José, and tell us the whole story. What do you know of the Americanos?Who are they? Where did they come from? That I cannot say, señor. After the banditos were gone, I come here to report. Looks like we have a lot to thank these Americans for. I shall try to meet them and thank them in person. Temporarily, señor, I think we should delay the shipment of that bullion. We might not be so lucky the next time. Here come the two Americanos now, señor. Papacito,this is Larry Prescott-- José has told me the story. I have not the words to thank you, señores, -but my house is yours. -Thank you. This house is ours? Oh, that's mighty generous of you, Don. How much land goes with it? My name's McQuilt, Patches. What a cave. [group laughing] [Don Sebastian] José, tell Margarita we have visitors. [José] Si, señor. Well, lookie here. [chuckles] A little bitty groaner. [accordion hums] Margarita, Margarita? [José speaks in Spanish] I want you to meet my daughter, Margarita. This is my good friend, SeñorPrescott. I'm beginning to wish I'd come to Mexico a long time ago. You are too gracious, señor. Rita, we must arrange a little celebration for our friends, no? Oh, that'll be too much trouble, Don Sebastian. Trouble? Why, it's no trouble at all. [laughs] Just let me get a little sleep. Doggone, then you can bring 'em home to pasture. Why, I'll grind out a couple of tunes on this groaner, it'll make history. I'll knock 'em off their seats, I'll roll 'em in the aisles. I'll-- -[accordion hums] -Whew. I'll, uh, I'll see ya later. [group laughs] Howdy, miss. Would you like to hear me play a couple of tunes on this here squeezy box? Squeezy box? Well, you know, push me, pull me, serenade. [speaks in Spanish] Whatever you call it, it all comes out the same. Let's see, what'll I play? Oh, yes. Wait a minute, have you got a boyfriend? Oh, no, señor. I had one once, but he fell in the river up to his ankles, head first. Did it hurt him? I don't know, he didn't come up yet. That's all I wanna know. Let's see now, here we go.

I have not told you the reason why because I did not wish to alarm you. Perhaps it is best that I explain. ♪ Carmencita ♪ ♪ No one else could be sweeter ♪ ♪ If there's ever a bride ♪ ♪ That I want by my side ♪ ♪ Carmencita, it's you ♪ You thought your father was killed in the raid on the first bullion train, did you not, querida? Why, of course. He was killed after the raid while he was going for help, in spite of a warning we had already received. Do you read Spanish, señor? Well, if it's not too complicated, I do. "Our spies know your every plan. Any attempt to get help from the soldiers will result in the death of the messenger. Signed, The White Mask." -You never tried again, huh? -I will close the mine first. I cannot send a man to his death to protect my property. I'm on my way to the garrison, Pablo, to bring soldiers. Tell Don Sebastian, but not till I am far enough so I cannot be overtaken. [Pablo speaks in Spanish] Gracias,Pablo. Maybe I can get out and get you some help. Nobody knows me around here, and-- You better forget it. They'd have a double reason for wanting to get you. You are the last one to try, señor. After what happened today, you are a marked man. Yeah, likely you're right. [midtempo accordion music] You know, Sebastian, if you don't mind, I'd like to stay here and help you run down The White Mask. If you take my advice, you'll get outta here while you can. I'm afraid Mr. Prescott is in so far he could not get out even if he wishes to. Señor,José left a message for you. -What message? -He has gone to the garrison to send in the soldiers to help you. Send someone after him to stop him! -Señor... -He will be killed! [gentle accordion music] Have Pancho saddle the horse and go after him. -Si, señor. -If you'll excuse me, I must see he is mounted on the best horse. I hope it isn't too late to do him some good. Yeah, me too. Well, I gotta get to the mine, see you at the fiesta. Good, I'll be looking for you. [Patches sings gibberish] That's not a sad song. ♪ I know it's not ♪ Then why are you crying?

[whimpering] Gee, you're a lotta help. -[dramatic music] -[punches smacking] Now you're going inside and do some talking. [White Mask] You are mistaken, SeñorPrescott. You want to meet The White Mask. You are looking at him for the first and the last time. [gun fires] Doggone, I missed him. [dramatic music] That'll teach ya, never try to pull a knife on me. Get back to your prisoner. I've been tricked. "S.V., Sebastian Valdez." Could be. And it could be just a plant. [lively orchestral music] [castanets clacking] I've taken a great liking to your friend SeñorPrescott. Seems to run in the family. [laughs] I hope you're right, querida. And I also hope it does not make SeñorDouglas too jealous. Don't you worry about Larry, he can take care of himself. [castanets clacking] [cheers and applause] -[gentle acoustic music] -[men sing in Spanish] [cheers and applause] You know, I think I've got a good idea. I'll go get you a glass of punch. I, I think I have a better idea. -I think I will go with you. -Good. You seem to think a lot of Mexico, Prescott. Why, I always have liked Mexico. I don't know why I should lose interest now. Well, there's such a thing as being too interested in Mexico. I don't like the way you said that, Douglas. Mexico's proud if it has one interest to SeñorPrescott. That makes up for a lotta things. -[castanets clacking] -[lively instrumental music] [cheers and applause] [lively instrumental music] [castanets clacking] [castanets clacking] [laughs] -Wow! [wailing] -[Carmencita gasps] [applause] [laughs] [gentle acoustic music] [men singing in Spanish] [whispers indistinctly] Where? Doyou know where SeñorPrescott is? Why, he's over there with Margarita. Margarita, you stay here with Jean. SeñorPrescott, come with me, please. [men singing in Spanish] [audience applauds] I found this paper fastened to his shirt, señor. [lively instrumental music] -Have him carried to my room. -Señor. [man speaks in Spanish] [men singing in Spanish] [cheers and applause] Señores... amigos mios, my daughter and I ask your forgiveness if we bring the fiesta to an end. I believe you would not have me do otherwise when you understand what has happened. [partygoers chatter in Spanish] Don Sebastian, my partner and I would like permission to help you to run down The White Mask. I am sorry, but he has already cost the lives of too many friends. -But, señor,I-- -Please. There is but one thing to do. I will close down the mine. But Papacito,if you close down the mine, you'll lose everything you own, this hacienda, your cattle, everything. Then, I shall have to lose it. How will he lose the hacienda? Has he borrowed money on it? Yes, from Douglas, to meet the payroll. -From Douglas? -Yes. That explains a lotta things. Well, what do you mean? Someone is trying to make it look as if Don Sebastian himself is The White Mask. How could they do that? I'll tell you later. But what I wanna know now, would one shipment of bullion -clean up Don Sebastian's debts? -Oh, easily. How many men on this ranch do you think are loyal to him? I think all of them are, Larry. Good, let's have a talk with 'em. All right. The question is, men, are you willing to take a chance for Don Sebastian and his daughter? -Si. -[men chatter] Good, then saddle your horses and a dozen pack mules and be ready to leave at dawn. [men chatter in Spanish] -Sir-- -He's over there. What's goin' on here? Why wasn't I in on it? Saddle your horse, there's work to do. Work? Dad burn it, I've been tricked again. [suspenseful music] What's goin' on here? I'm sorry if we disturbed you, but this silver's going out at daylight. Oh, no, it's not. Not without an order from the boss. Put it back. I've got an order. This order's no good, it's not signed by Don Sebastian. But it's signed by Miss Malone, and she owns as much of the mine as he does. I'm not takin' orders from Miss Malone. But I am. You can try and stop me if you like. [suspenseful music] How do I know you're not workin' for The White Mask? Would you like for me to tell you how you know? Or would you rather forget it and go back to bed? Eh. All right, boys. [suspenseful orchestral music] Luke, Luke, open the door. [Luke] Who is it? Who do you suppose? Open the door. Round up the men and get them on the trail as quick as you can. This time a night, what for? Prescott is leaving at daylight with every ounce of silver in the vault. -But-- -Don't argue, get moving. [suspenseful orchestral music] [snoring] [chuckles] Hey, Patches, I'm ready to pull out. Well, go ahead and pull, see if I care. [laughs] Uh, Larry... Patches, your mules are loaded and waiting at the other entrance of the mine. How long do you want me to wait after you pull out? Oh, about an hour, that oughta be long enough. But don't let Douglas see you. Oh, that hammerhead, he don't know-- -Good morning, Douglas. -Good morning. Hi, Doug. Say, I'd kinda like to square myself for the way I acted last night. Oh, that's all right. A man has got a right to be a little grouchy when you wake him up in the middle of the night. -Well, good luck to you. -Thanks. I think we'll have it this trip. Hey, Pedro, vamonos. -[men chattering] -[suspenseful music] Aren't you goin' to the pack train? Who me? No, I... I got a little rheumatism in my t-t-trigger finger. Don't let that worry you. They're ridin' down the trail, but they won't be here for a half hour or more. Well, we'll set off before. Hank, better ride down, watch for 'em. All right, boss. -Buenos dias. -Oh, buenos dias! -Buenos dias. -Where are the American friends? I have been up an hour and have not seen them. They're fixing up a little surprise for you. So, what sort of a surprise? They're on the way to the railroad with a load of bullion for you. What, they are doing that after what I told them last night? I gave them permission and the keys to the vault. But they will be robbed the same as the others. I do not think so, Papacito. You see, a fake pack train leaves for the regular trail for The White Mask to follow and attack. An hour later, the real bullion leave for the old trail down Black Canyon. It may work! Oh, but I should be with them, sharing the risk. Pablo, saddle my horse quickly. -Si, señor. -Mine too, Pablo. -[playful orchestral music] -[alarm ringing] [suspenseful orchestral music] Here they come. Only Douglas ain't showed up. Reckon we oughta jump 'em, or wait for him? No use in waitin', we can handle 'em. Leave your horses, we'll sneak down and ambush 'em. That ain't the pack train we wanted, -it's a decoy. -Whaddya mean? One of the bullion's headed over the ridge into Black Canyon. Get mounted. It seems funny we haven't been jumped. I expected it long before now. Si, señor.Something is going barbed wire. All the time we got it before we got now. I think you're right, Pedro. Something has gone barbed wire. Come on, let's try a little further on. [bold orchestral music] [birds chirping] There's the bullion train, Papacito. Didn't I tell you the trick would work? It's The White Mask! The White Mask is right behind us. The White Mask? Take cover at them rocks, men, ho! [dramatic music] Next time they charge by, be ready to mount and ride with SeñorPrescott. Mount those mules and head for the hideout. Yeah, and Larry Prescott'll come along a few minutes later and take 'em away from you again. Nothing would suit me better, I've got a big score to settle with him. Come on, get going. [dramatic orchestral music] Pull that bullion in a wagon for a getaway if anything goes wrong. [men chattering] So you thought you could outsmart The White Mask, eh? I still think I can. If Larry Prescott doesn't follow us here and turn us loose, I'll boycott him. That's why we brought you here, for bait. That's why I left a trail so broad that even Prescott could follow it. We'll be waiting for him when he gets here. When they find his body, he'll have the white mask on. Oh, go away, you bore me. Don't worry, you won't have long to suffer. Gather 'round, you men, and be ready for Prescott if he shows up. You know, I'm beginning to dislike that fella immensely. And without avail. [playful instrumental music] Just as I thought, it's locked. What's the difference? We cannot get loose anyway. Oh, yes we can. My name is not Escape Artist McQuilt for nothing. Handcuffs, straight jackets, one-legged boots, country jails, bird cages, all the same to me. -And now, SeñorDon. -[knife clicks] Turn around. [suspenseful orchestral music] I got an idea. -Get that little mat. -What for? Don't ask papa questions, get the mat. Push it under the door. [key rattles] Now pull it out. Ah, magic. [key rattles] -Where are you goin'? -Who, me? I'm just goin' back and lockin' myself in. [Patches laughing] Hey, you gimme that key! Open that door! If you want this key, you try to get it the same way I did. [man knocking] First jail I was ever in that the jailer couldn't get into. [dramatic music] This is where they were fighting, but we're too late to help them. No, we're not. They left a trail broad enough to pick up and run. Come on! If we could only warn SeñorPrescott before he arrives into the trap. Yeah. We could weed rag 'em if we could get up on the roof. -I've got an idea. -What, another one? Yeah, but this one will work. Gimme a little help with this table. What for? I keep tellin' ya, quit askin' papa questions. That's like it. -[Patches groans] -[barrel thuds] [Patches giggles] [straw rustles] [dramatic music] Come on down, Don. Thanks, pal. If we could just find us some horses, we'll be all right. Hey, pal, I'll just take your guns. Say, this might be the wagon they was gonna put that bullion in. This is it. This is no time to speak of bullion. Larry said to get this bullion through, and when Larry says a thing, he means it. Come on, Don. [White Mask] Hey, Luke. What happened to you? I don't know, somebody jumped on me from up there. They got my gun and my rifle. [White Mask] They must've gotten out through the roof. They're getting away with the bullion. Get the men and ride 'em down. Mount up and get after 'em! [dramatic orchestral music] Come on, men, get after 'em! They're getting away, and the gang's right after 'em. [man] Yah! [wagon clatters] I still like Mexico, Douglas. But they're not going to have much use for you. You would make me very happy if you would stay here and take charge of the mine. Now that The White Mask has been taken care of, I'm sure Pedro can handle the mine, all right. [Jean] Better change your mind, Larry. Well, I-- Margarita, you talk to him. Come on, Papacito. You will stay for a little while, anyway? Well, I, I better speak to Patches. You see, I kinda promised him a vacation. I think he will say yes, all right. Are you waiting to sing for me? [snoring] You told me you would sing for me! -Who me? -Yes, you! Listen, honey, this is the first chance I've had to sleep in two days, and you talk about music. Then you're not going to sing? Nah. Then you don't love me! -[Patches yells] -[water splashes] [both laugh] Now you gonna sing for me, eh? Anything your little heart desires. [accordion hums discordantly] [triumphant orchestral music] [bold orchestral music]
