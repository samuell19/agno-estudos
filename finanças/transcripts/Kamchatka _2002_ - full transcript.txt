When I grow up, I wanna be a saint. I told you before, Simon Templar isn't a real saint. What's this? Who are you? Get out! Let me go! Let me go! What will you do with us? Don't waste your time. Perhaps he won't return. The ship needs him. Hello? Hello? Hello? - Who is it? - Some idiot. How come you don't know the name of any classmate? - They're all stupid. - No way! - Is that too tight? - Tighter. - Tighter? - Tighter. - I'm making it tight. - Perfect. Perfect. - I'll time you. - Stay on that side! - On the other side? - But don't look, okay? Let's see... If it's a minute, you're "Houdini". If it's 2, you're "Averagini". More than 3, you're "Louserini". - Come on! - Ready? - Yes. - Go, go! Hey, if you shit on your pants, you're out. Don't you have any friends? Of course I do. When do you see them? Never. Don't you ever feel like calling them? What if you call them? Would they tell you off? No. Why? I'm a fugitive and I don't wanna put them in danger. And the way things are... You're my only friend, now. You're all I've got. Well, you and your family. Come on! You're 30 seconds away from losing. Did you hear me? Sit up. It was too tight, you could say so! Or do I have to teach you to speak as well? Give me your hand. That's it. - Does it hurt? - I can't feel anything. Give me the other hand. If it's too tight it cuts off your bloodstream. - Better? - What if they don't come back? Mom and Dad, what if they don't come back? - We got held up. - Are the kids asleep? - Did they eat okay? - We had to avoid... ...the military check-out points. - Harry was a bit sick. I'm here, sweetie. Call me if you need me. I know you're awake, you know, 'cause I gave you birth. Of all my scientific experiments, which I did a lot... ...you're the one that came out best. I don't care if I'm talking nonsense... ...or drooling your ear... ...or if I sound like Bertuccio's mom. My sweet, my darling little boy... Keep all the kisses. I love you. Dad didn't agree, as usual. But I convinced him. So we leave... ...first thing Saturday and return Sunday night. Yes! We're going to grandpa's birthday. Yippee! We're going! - Can Lucas come? - I invited him but he's got stuff to do. - The oil's burning! - Get out of my way, I'm in a hurry. - Let me help. - Okay, come here. You gotta add some stock to the egg to make it tastier. - Where did you pick that up? - Bertuccio's mom told me. - She's a genius. - What a concept of genius you've got! So it's the same: Einstein, Michelangelo and Bertuccio's... ...mother who is a fat ass! - She's not fat. - Move... She's always at home and she helps with his homework! Yes, but you never need help. It's burning. You finish frying them, okay? Be careful with the oil. Any problems, ring Bertuccio's mom. - Are you serious? - No, just kidding. I was kidding! - You gotta go? - Yes. - Where? - A meeting at work. - You were fired! - They fired me from the lab. But I still have stuff to do. - More important than us? - No, never. So stay here, then. You can't ask me to do something wrong. Not you. You know, your dad's old now. He won't be with you much longer. If he gets on your nerves, take a deep breath... ...and count to ten. Do you do that every night? I wish she did. But we hear you every night going "Ah, ah, ah..." Look at him. He's been asleep the whole journey. No, remember, he woke up in La Plata asking about vaccines. "Daddy, daddy, do you have to be vaccinated to be a saint?" Look what he did! - I almost strangled him! - Don't give him hell, he hasn't... ...wetted the bed today. Well, I got up 3 times to take him to pee but it was worth it. - I got up once. - And me twice more! - I can't believe it. - That's why he looks like a zombie. - Zombie! Happy birthday, grandpa! Thank you. I see you still have that old heap! With two boys, it's the best car to have. Happy birthday. Open it! Open it! Oh, my favorites! - Mom, are they chocolate? - No, they're real. - Happy birthday, grandpa. - More gifts! Let's see. I don't know if you want to please me or kill me? Whisky and cigars! You know when I last saw you? - When? - 6 months and 12 days ago. It's not your fault. ...8, 9, 10. And now? Do I start again? Take a deep breath. First, second, third, fourth... ...and reverse. Again, but harder. - That's it, good. - First... ...second, third... ...fourth... - Tell me, your friend from China? - Japan! - China, Japan... How is he doing? - He changed school last year. - Really? What about... what's his name, Bertutti? - Bertuccio! - Bertuccio. How's Bertuccio doing? Don't tell me he also changed school! - No, I did. - Really? To a religious school run by a priest friend of dad's. Since we've been going, my brother wants to be a saint. We live in the suburbs. Mom was fired from the lab. Dad had to shut down... ...his law office. Some militars broke into it... ...and destroyed everything, they seized Roberto, his partner. Sometimes he works at home. Before, he used to work in pubs but there were... ...a lot of policemen around. Promise me something. Grandpa. Grandpa. - Yes. - Don't fight. Not this time. If I'm not wrong, there should be one here. - What's that smell? - Mothballs. That's how things last for so long. Here we go. This one. Let's see... I knew it would fit. This is all like it always was, right? I mean, when dad was a kid. Just the same. Why didn't you change it? - Into a playroom! - For me? In a way, it is a playroom, the way it is. It's my time machine. Whenever I come to dust, I sit here and look around... ...and remember things. You miss him, don't you? You want to know if I go around weeping like a fool? No, I don't. But I like to remember the good old times. We gotta find a reed... ...as thick as a finger, more or less. Hollow it, then you can use it to breathe under water. - This one? - No, as thick as my finger not yours. If not, you can't breathe! - But there aren't any that thick. - There are a lot, look. All right. Schools always need teachers. That could be a temporary solution, at least. Try and convince him. If I do... ...he won't listen. If his dad does, hell's gonna burn. You know how they are, two of a kind. Come in, love. We're also to blame. Why? 'Cause we taught him to take love, but not to give it. They love each other whether fighting or playing tough. You know what it's like to live with 3 brutes. But then, when they grow up and can't fight any more... Nothing will change. Someway, they'll fight differently. You won't be like that, will you, dear? The situation's tough, dad, militars kill people every day. We want to be together as much as we can. Is it so hard to understand? - Come on, pour. - It'll hurt. - You must see a doctor! - Pour. David Vincent is brave and doesn't cry. - Are you okay? - Yes. Poor bird, eh? - Can I take one? - Yes. Here. Then it's bath time, ok? All right. See you up there. No, wait. Hang it round your neck. Like that. - Press here, right? - Yes. This one to shoot... ...and turn here to wind the film. - What are you doing? - I'm taking a photo. No, don't, really. I hate photos. You can take one of all this, or that duck... - Who cares about the duck? - Go on, take one, but not of me. I always come out with a stupid grin on my face... ...and you wonder, "What was this guy thinking about?" What are you thinking about now? That my son's a pain in the ass taking photos... ...when I don't want. - Come on, dad, tell me. That we should've come here more often. And... why don't we stay? Because we can't. Look at me. Hey, look at me. Look at me now. Look at me now. We can't, son. We can't. We can't. Do you understand? Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Grandpa... ... happy birthday to you. Blow! Bravo! What a lot of smoke! Move together for a photo. Cheer up a bit, please. - Grandpa's teaching me to drive. - I wanna learn, too. - Tell grandpa he's nuts. - He told me you'd say that. He also told me to tell you that you learned to drive... ...when you were younger than me. That's better. Sleep, little baby... ... your mommy's in the field. Leave him, you big boy. You'll wake him. May I? - Look, a shooting star! - Where? There. Didn't you see it? It's gone now. It fell. When your mom and dad were engaged... ...we'd sit here after dinner, looking at the sky. There were lots of Russian and US satellites and capsules then. On a moonless night, you could see them. We did once. Mom and her satellite! It was a shooting star! - It was a red light! - No! Red was the wine you had. What's a shooting star? If you stare at the sky without blinking... ...you might see a star... ...come and go... ...at 1000 mph. - Goodnight all. - See you tomorrow. - Come here, grandpa. - No, you're going to make me fall. Careful, be careful. Who's gonna get me up now? - He will, he's the strongest in the family. - Stay there, grandpa. If I get cold, not even a crane will get me out of here! They're called shooting stars... ...but they are really meteorites or bits of rock... - No, no science, please! - Sure? - Yeah. - I can't see anything. You have to be patient. If you see one, you can make a wish. - What have wishes to do with stars? - Honestly I don't know... ...but they always come true. I made one once, right here. - And it came true. - Really? Whatever, but I'm sure it was a satellite. For God's sake, mom! - Look, another one! - Where? There, look. You're a liar, mom! Shooting stars are stones... ... that burn up when they get close to the atmosphere. Mom was right about that. For some reason... ... they are directly related to wishes. Dad was right about this. I watched and watched till my eyes burnt... ... but I didn't see anything. That must be why my wish didn't come true. Lucas! Lucas! Lucas! You're gonna knock me down. What happened to the lights? A local blackout. What's up? You got a minute? Give your mom a hand before it rains. Come on! Dead toad! Dead toad! This isn't a hole. It's an elevator. We'll put it there so it can go straight... ...to toads' heaven. I'm gonna wash my hands. I gotta go. Now? You'll get soaking wet! - Your dad's taking me to the station. - Can I go? - No. - Why not? It's just a second. It's late. I waited just to say goodbye. I'm going, Harry, this time for good. - Do you really have to go? - Yes. Why? Wrong question. Is that it, then? "Bye", I turn and leave? - Aren't we friends? - Friends? What for? We'll never see each other again. - I left my orange T-shirt. - Go get it yourself. Lucas! Lucas! If they ask, say I'm ill. - Mom's gonna be mad. - Say you don't know. Say we went in together and you didn't see me again. Okay? Go on, I'll meet you here. Oh, I forgot. Your comic. Three requirements... ... distinguish the professional escapist from the amateur. First, discipline. The escapist knows his task is a daily one... ... arduous and restless. A ticket to Buenos Aires. Second, concentration. The escapist must distinguish... ... the important from the superfluous. The last requirement is courage. The escapist needs it... ... to see his task through to the end. Good morning. - Is Bertuccio in? - No, he's not back. He's at his aunt's. That's a pity. - Tell him I called by. - Of course, dear. Can I come by another day? Yes, but phone first. The Houdini book tells a lot of things. Where he was born, who his parents where... ... how he became famous... ... what his most difficult stunts were. The only thing it doesn't tell... ... is how he managed to escape. He's coming! Mom, Dad, he's coming! Mom, Dad, he's here! Mom, Dad, he's here! My little boy, my little boy. That night we had a historic match. Spain to Great Britain with 3. With 2. I immediately began to beat my dad. I was beating him by far. Brazil to Sahara with 3. You move your counters, I'll move mine, okay? At the crucial point... ... I controlled forty-nine countries. Forty-nine! And he had only one. Siberia to Kamchatka with 3. China to Kamchatka with 3. Japan to Kamchatka with 3. Wait! I'm regrouping! - May I explain? - Shut up and play! Add three. Pass. China to Kamchatka with 3. This went on for hours. Kamchatka versus the rest of the world. But I couldn't beat him. Kamchatka to Siberia, 3. The following morning, Dad called for action. Hurry up! Take him! Mom? What's wrong with dad? They also got Oscar. What do we do now? Can I go to the toilet? Wait till dad finishes. I can go with him, he's finished. - There you go. - Go out. - Are you there? - Yes. Did you see all the people out there eating? Do you think they were also called for action? Faster! Faster! PEDRO '75. HARRY '76. I need to know they'll be safe from all this shit. Do you know what I fear? No, what? Never ever seeing them again. - What would you like? - Coffee and milk. Grandma is so happy about your coming! And the Little Guy? He's asleep in the car. I think that if he wakes and you're gone, he'll be scared. He's with mom. I love you. I'll wait by the van. Be a good boy. I love you very much. And never forget... The last time I saw him... ... my dad spoke of Kamchatka. This time I understood. Whenever I played... ... dad was with me. When the game got tough... ... I stayed with him and survived. Because Kamchatka... ... is the place to be when you want to resist. by Cachito
