Are you sure you want to do this? You know what'll happen if you get caught. That answer your question? Jerk deserves it. [sirens wailing] Cops! Hey Lillian. You know, I'm having a little housewarming party next Saturday if you'd like to come. Didn't you move into that house three months ago? I did. But I just wasn't in the mood for a party then. I find parties to be a frivolous waste of time better spent. So thank you, but no thank you. Hi Roe. Hi. Wanna take a look at the outline for my bloody benders talk for Real Murders tonight, see if I missed anything? Sure. I was thinking of bringing the new photographer from the paper, Stanley, to see if maybe- Sally, I am fine since Martin left, but I am in no way ready to date again- Woah, woah, woah. It's not a set-up. He's just a true crime buff like the rest of us. And he's bringing his lovely wife. Oh. You're disappointed. You might be more ready than you think. See you tonight. Hi. Hi. Mother, you sure know how to sell a house. It seems like you just put the one next door on the market. I just met the buyer. He's a psychology professor at the college. A delight to talk to, and I wanna take you over there and introduce you. Come on. Oh, I can't right now. Your nephew's on his way over for dinner. You can stay and join us if you'd like. Phillip is coming? Oh, I will stay. I see less of him now that he's moved here than I did when he lived two states over. Well, someone has to save him from that college cafeteria food. I lure him with spaghetti. Spaghetti? I'll make a salad. But come on, spend five minutes with me and we'll go meet the new neighbor. He's intelligent, good-looking, single... Mother, please stop trying to fix me up. But you've been sitting around this house with nothing but your books as company for months. What-that's not true. I have Phillip over at least once or twice a week and I have my Real Murders Club- And now you have a handsome new neighbor. So why don't you cooperate and let's go over and meet him. [knocking] Oh, never mind, that's Phillip. Hello. Hey, Aunt Aida, where've you been hiding? Don't pretend you haven't been ignoring my calls, young man. You mean you actually talk on the phone? We do this thing now, it's called texting, you should really try it. Hey cousin. Hey back. Wanna grab that pot and fill it with water for the pasta? See how she is? She invites me to dinner and then she makes me cook. [knocking] Oh, can you grab that? Oh, sure. Nick. I was just talking to Aurora about you. Come on in. I want to introduce you. I'm sorry, I can't right now. I'm knee-deep with the movers. You dropped your glove. Oh, thank you. Um, you can't even come in for a cup of coffee? Another time, but thank you. Bye for now. Oh hi. Hi. That's your new neighbor. I love having you in town. I'm so glad you chose Lawrenceton College as your school. Yeah well other schools didn't have Roe nearby. Or you. I remember visiting you when I was little. You'd take me with you to show houses and I'd get to run around in these big empty rooms. [laughs] Totally my coolest aunt. Aw, did you hear that, mother? You're cool. Oh, well I never aspired to coolness. Don't think you can help it. You might as well just go with it. Why don't you and I go to a barber? Sure. I'll go short if you do. [phone ringing] Oh, it's your mom. She probably wants to know how you're doing. Hello. So, what classes are you taking this semester? How about psychology? You wanna know if I have any classes with Professor Miller. Well, I'm just curious about my new neighbor. Well, I don't have any with him but I hear all about him from Tammy, my roommate's girlfriend. "Professor Miller's so awesome. "Professor Miller's the most amazing teacher I've ever had." Mmm. He sounds very impressive. It drives Josh crazy. Josh Farrell? Is he still your roommate? I thought you guys were having issues. He's a bit of a night owl. He kept waking me up, but we got this screen thing so I don't see his light anymore. We actually have a pretty sweet set-up. You should come by and check it out. Oh, I would love to. But tonight I have to get to my Real Murders Club meeting. Do you wanna go with me? I wish I could but I have to get back and study. Think I could come by another time, though? Yes. I would love it if there was another true crime buff in the family. Awesome. Ok, I will. Yes, I'll talk to you next week. Ok, bye. Your mom wants you to call her. I will. How's Aunt Mary doing? She's still laid up from that broken hip. But she reminded me that tomorrow's your birthday. Oh, that's right, it is! We should take you out to dinner to celebrate. Oh, he doesn't wanna go out with us. No, that sounds really nice. Can Josh come? Of course. Where would you like to go? Um... can I let you know tomorrow? You may. Sweet. Make that groovy. Isn't that your generation's word? [laughs] Thanks for dinner, Roe. Of course. Any time. So this is Drum Creek, Kansas, where the first body was found in late 1871. Two more bodies were found the next February, but nobody suspected the Bender family. Ma and Pa Bender welcomed in travelers passing through on the road, and their children, John and Katie, well, they were always at church on Sunday. Wait, church? I thought Katie was into some dark stuff, you know? Seances or whatever. You're right, Jason. She was. She called herself a healer and a psychic, and some of the bodies they found in the graves on the Bender property were her customers. Yeah. Yeah, she'd invite them to this cabin here. She'd sit them at a table in front of a canvas curtain that hid her father and brother from sight. And there they waited with hammers in their hands. [sirens wailing] That sounded like it came from right outside the hall. I'll go see what's going on. I didn't tell you to get out of the car, Harrison. I'm calling my dad. Get back in the car. Now. Alright, that's it. Turn around. Hands behind your back. That's Clayton Harrison. His family is pretty high-profile around here. Like the Harrisons that have that big house over on River Road? Yes, it is. I hope you're not too attached to your job, officer, 'cause you're gonna get fired. So that's how spoiled rich kids end up. His parents are actually very nice. My father used to work with his dad. Well, spoiled or not, if he's getting arrested it's probably news. Alright everyone, let's go back in and finish our meeting. Well, I hope his parents show up soon. Lynn is usually chomping at the bit by now for a break from the baby. Oh, hi Arthur. Oh, hey Sally. What can I do for you? What you can do for the Lawrenceton Times. I saw Clayton Harrison being arrested, Macon wanted me to come down here and find out why, seeing as his parents are such a big deal in town. Is it news? I'd say it's minor news. [clears throat] Ahem. I'll go file that report. Thank you, Officer Heard. The college is pressing charges against Clayton for property damage. You know the sculpture outside the administration building? Yeah, the eyesore? That's the one. Clayton did some artistic improvement to it. Covered it in paint. Are you serious? I don't think the college found it that funny, Sally. Of course they didn't. Oh, and I don't think his parents find it that funny, either. Excuse me. Mr. and Mrs. Harrison. The press already knows about this. Oh, um... Sorry, Clayton was arrested right in front of me, but if you want to give me a quote for the story I'd be more than happy to include it- No, I would not. Ok. I know you're just doing your job. (Tammy): I'm just saying don't text me at 3:00 in the morning, 4:00 in the morning, and 5:00 in the morning. (Josh): I thought you were awake. (Tammy): I was awake- Hey. Oh! Phillip. Hi. Hey. Happy birthday. Thank you. Oh, you got company. It sounds like you do, too. You remember meeting Josh, right? Of course. Hi Josh. How are you? Good, thanks. Come on in. Roe, have you ever met Josh's girlfriend, Tammy? No. Hi Tammy. Hi. Not sure when you would have met her. She never has time to do anything. Or at least never has time to do anything with me. It's nice to meet you. You too. Oh, open your gift. You didn't have to do that, Roe. Wow, it's... retro. I thought you could wear it for dinner tonight. Depending on what restaurant you choose. I was thinking Giuseppe's. That cool with you, Josh? I love that place. Is it cool if Tammy comes? Well yeah, especially since she got me those sweet balloons. Sorry, I can't come. I have a haircut at 5:00. That's ok, we can do dinner at 6:00. If that's cool with you, Roe. Oh, sure. Yeah, the more the merrier. I'm taking the bus, actually, so... We'll just take you to the salon, wait, then bring you to dinner. Right Phillip? Yeah. Come on, it's his birthday. Plus it'll be more fun with you there. She doesn't have to come if she doesn't want to. No, she wants to. Don't you? Yeah, I would love to. Um, if you really don't mind picking me up? No. It was nice meeting you. Bye. Hey, where are we going? Tammy? He's like a puppy dog the way he follows her around. So, wanna walk me to class? Cool. Do you know how much money I donate to this school? How many meetings I have to sit through for the college to give me this spot? I want that kid to get more than just a slap on the wrist, you understand? I do, Mr. Murphy, but you know, Clayton Harrison's already on probation with the school. They're threatening to expel him. I plan to make sure they do. Ok then. You know you don't have to wear that shirt. Oh, I'm wearing the shirt. Besides, I don't think I'll run into anyone I know at Giuseppe's anyway, so... Are you implying I have no taste? No, I'm implying you're kinda old. Oh! Oh. I saw the paper when I went to get coffee this morning. It said Clayton Harrison was arrested for this. Are you still friends with him? Why would you ask that? Oh, I remember you playing with him a few times at my house when you came to visit. My parents had those dinner parties for their business friends. The Harrisons always brought Clayton, remember? Oh... yeah, yeah. We'd uh, we'd play video games and he'd throw a fit when he lost so that is not really much of a surprise. Well, I better get to class. So we'll meet you and Aunt Aida just at Giuseppe's at 6:00? We'll be there. Cool. Catch to you later, Roe. Bye. Oh. Oh! I'm so sorry. It's you. I was hoping to run into you. I didn't expect to get run over. Yeah, they should not let me drive one of these things. But normally I run into chairs not people. Well hopefully they come out with a self-driving cart soon. Well for our patrons' sake I sure hope so. Nick Miller. Aurora Teagarden. But everyone calls me Roe, it's easier. Roe. I like it. It's unique. I met your mom yesterday. The real estate queen? That's my mother. Regal through and through. I think it was her photo on the sign in front of the house that first made me like the place. Something about her smile. It made the place feel warm and welcoming. Oh, what a nice thing to say. You have the same smile. Oh, so this is what it's like talking to a psychology professor. They all know the right things to say. Your mother said you have a suspicious mind. Wh-no she did not. Don't worry, I get it. Son of a cop. Well, there might be a little truth to that 'cause I am wondering why you're here at this library when you're a professor at a college that has a library twice the size. True. But their section on home repair is on the skimpy side. I have a problem. Too many books, not enough shelves. Hmm. I don't suppose you can relate. My mother told you about my never-ending quest for bookshelf space. Or I have insight into the psychology of librarians. Oh, um... I have to get back to work, but um, I guess I will see you around the neighborhood. I hope so. Why are you flushed? I am? And why is that shelving cart in the middle of the floor? Yeah, I'll go get that. Tammy. You ok? Professor Miller, yeah, I'm fine. I knew it. I assign too much homework, don't I? No, no you don't. I'm fine, really. Alright then, have a good afternoon. Are you sure you're ok? Uh... So Phillip said 6:00 and it's now 6:27. Well I just sent him another text. Oh, I met the psychology professor today. Did you now? So do you see why I wanted to introduce you? Yes. Yeah, he-he was interesting. I think he'll be a good addition to the neighborhood. [laughs] Ok. Hey you two. Had a craving for lasagna? Well, it was my nephew's craving but he's late for his own birthday party. What about you? Oh I had to work late so I'm just picking up some dinner to eat back at my desk but it's not ready yet. Hmm. Well sit, wait with us. Ok. If I do I'm gonna steal some of your bread. [phone ringing] Oh, finally. Here's Phillip. Hey birthday boy. You know we're here waiting for you, don't ya? Yeah, sorry, I fell asleep. I'm not feeling so hot. Oh no. What's wrong? I'm getting sick I think. I'm not gonna make it, ok? I'm just gonna stay in bed. Oh, I'm so sorry. Is there anything that we can- I gotta go. Bye. That was odd. Is he alright? He said he's feeling sick and wants to stay in bed. Oh, what a shame, on his birthday. Well, we might as well order. I'm famished. You go ahead. I think I'm gonna pick up some soup and take it to the dorm. Well, call me after you've seen him, in case there's something I should do. I will. [knocking] Phillip? It's Roe. I brought you soup. [knocking] Phillip, is everything ok? I'm coming in. [knocking] Oh hey, uh, I think I'm in the right place, is Tammy Driscoll around? I'm Aurora Teagarden. Hi. I'm Portia. She's not here right now, she was just going to a birthday dinner. Right, that's for my cousin, Phillip Pifer. Do you know him? Sure, I know Phillip. Well, he called me and he told me he was sick but he's not in his room so I was hoping that I could find Tammy and she could help me locate Phillip. Oh, I haven't seen Tammy since this afternoon. My guess is around 4:00 or so when I left. Tammy was arguing with Josh on her phone. As usual. Uh, do you know what they were arguing about? I try and tune it out. Oh, hey, do you happen to know where she was supposed to get that haircut? Well, yeah. It's Shear Delight. Ok, thanks Portia. [ringing] Hey Sally, are you still at the office? The Shear Delight hair salon is right down the street from you, right? Can you meet me there? Well, you didn't think it'd be open at this hour, did you? Well, it was worth a shot. Someone might still be here. Let's take a look around back. I just don't understand why Phillip would tell me he's staying in bed sick when he wasn't. Why would he lie to me? Well, it's his birthday. Maybe he wanted to do something more exciting but didn't wanna hurt your feelings. [gasps] Oh! Oh, it's her! It's Tammy. Tell me she's got a pulse. No. Ahh! Oh, Tammy, what happened to you? No mother, no sign of Phillip or Josh. Because of the injuries the police are calling it a likely hit and run. I just feel so terrible for this girl and her family. Yeah, yeah. I'll keep trying Phillip's phone, too. Ok. Do you see what I see? Pavement? Wait, actually, it's what I don't see. Tire marks. And that means...? Well, if Tammy was hit by accident there would be tire marks where the car tried to stop or swerve. Roe, you should not be speculating. Arthur, do you think somebody tried to hit her on purpose? Have you heard from your cousin yet? No. Have you tracked down Josh Farrell? No, not yet, but Officer Heard is over at the dormitory. Apparently the boys were seen leaving their room together just after 4:00 I know what you're thinking. You said the roommate heard the victim fighting with Josh Farrell because he wanted to give her a ride here? That doesn't mean he did. Josh Farrell doesn't even have a car. I'm told that Phillip Pifer drives him just about everywhere. You don't really know that's how Tammy got here. Then where are they, Roe? I mean, why did your cousin lie? Why did he say he was home sick in bed when he wasn't? And why isn't he answering his phone? Arthur, if you are suggesting that Phillip killed Tammy- Or, more likely, the boyfriend. But you think Josh Farrell could have been driving Phillip's car? Tammy's roommate said that she was fighting with Josh, and you said it yourself. There's no tire marks. No. No. If Phillip were with him he would have called the police. He wouldn't just leave Tammy here and-and run off with Josh. Ok, can you think of a better explanation for why those guys got in their car and just disappeared? Will you please go with me to talk to Tammy's roommate again? No, Roe, you're not going to talk to Tammy's roommate again, ok? You are going home. Please, just let us handle this. Goodnight. We have to figure out what happened to Tammy. [knocking] Aurora? Yeah. You didn't answer my knock. No, I did, I yelled for you to come in. I think I've taught you better than yelling to answer the door. Here's your newspaper. Thank you. This story makes it sound like the police think Phillip and this Josh Farrell hit the girl with Phillip's car and then fled in a panic. Which is absolutely ridiculous. I totally agree, but I'm worried. Mother, where is he? I spoke to Phillip Pifer's mother, she can't travel, broken hip. She referred us to her sister, Aida Teagarden. Ok, thanks. I- I finally reached Tammy Driscoll's parents in Arizona. Hardest call I've ever had to make. I can't even imagine. Oh hey, uh, can you see if Roe will take Phillip's laptop? Maybe she can help us figure out his password. You want her to help? I know, but she knows him best. Alright. Officer Heard! Yeah. Hey Arthur, I was hoping to get some quotes from you for my follow-up and I heard you were here... I don't care what you think you're supposed to do. I'm going to my son's room. He's missing and I want answers. Oh hi, hello, are you Josh's mom? Mrs. Farrell, I'm Detective Arthur Smith. How about we find a place to talk? Yes, please. I don't know why that officer spoke as if Josh has done something wrong. He's a good boy and he was crazy about Tammy. $4,000? Phillip doesn't have a part-time job, does he? I mean, why would he have that much money stashed in a box? I don't know. Maybe his mother gave it to him or maybe he won it playing poker. Or maybe I don't know Phillip as well as I thought. Although wouldn't that be the best evidence that he didn't take off with Josh? Because wouldn't he take the money with him if he wanted to disappear? Well, one thing's for sure. The boys are not hiding out with Josh's mother in Corinth. She showed up at the dorm today demanding answers. Did you talk to her? No. Arthur whisked her away. [knocking] [knocking] Hi. Roe. Come on in. Is this true? You found Tammy Driscoll dead last night? Yes. Unfortunately we did. And the detective quoted in the article, he really thinks this could have been murder? Well, he's gonna treat it as such until they can rule it out. I'm Sally Allison. I wrote the article. Nick Miller. I wanted it to be a mistake. I- I know, I'm so sorry. She was a student of yours, wasn't she? Yes, a very good student and a nice young woman. I better get down to the police station. Why are you headed to the police station? Because I talked to Tammy yesterday afternoon and she didn't have good things to say about her boyfriend. Can we chat with you for a minute before you go to the station? Sure. It's ok, Portia, take your time. I know this is upsetting. I just... I feel so bad I didn't try harder to be friends with Tammy. She was just... always with Josh. And what was he like? Obsessive. Jealous. I mean, Tammy had this light. People gravitated to her and... he didn't like it. And he had this crazy idea that she and her friend, Brian, were going out behind his back. Did she complain to you about him? Yes. She was thinking of breaking up with him but... she was afraid of what he'd do if she did. I just... I never thought that... Look, Portia, this is important, ok? If you can think of anybody who would want to hurt Tammy... No. Just... Josh? Ok. I was headed to my office. What time was that? 4:30. A little after. I saw Tammy sitting on a bench near the parking lot. Long face, so I stopped. I asked if she was alright. And was she alright? No. She said she was having boyfriend problems. Seemed pretty upset about it. Did she give you any details about those problems? Not really. I try not to get too personal with my students, but she just looked so unhappy that I felt like I had to stop to talk to her. She was waiting for her boyfriend to come pick her up. I might have been one of the last people to see her alive. Maybe I should have tried harder to help her. You can't blame yourself. We still don't know what happened. We're not even sure Josh and Phillip picked her up. Or did you see her get in their car? No. So somebody else could have picked her up. Yeah, someone else could have. It is possible that Josh and Phillip could have pulled up just in time to see her get into somebody else's car. That could have been enough to enrage Josh. Did Tammy text or call anybody while you were talking with her? No. So you didn't see her talk to anyone else? No, she... wait, there was a kid on a skateboard, a student I didn't recognize. He went back and forth a few times while we were talking. He called over to her and asked her if she was ready for some exam. He was still rippin' around nearby when I went into the psychology building. So they must have been in a class together. What did he look like? He had red hair. He was showing off a little, doing tricks. He flipped his skateboard up with his foot and I noticed decals all over it. Skulls and flames. I'd better get down to the station and talk to them. Thank you for telling us what you saw. We should try to find that skateboarder. Find out if he saw anything else. Your cousin is missing too, isn't he? He is. Yeah, we are all worried sick. We haven't heard from him since he called me last night and we don't know where he is now or why he disappeared. So this is personal for you. It is. But even if it wasn't I would want to find out what happened to Tammy. Well, I wanna help. You have helped. I only teach Tuesdays and Thursdays so I have some free time. I wanna know what happened to Tammy, too. This is my number. Please call me. Whatever you need. Thank you. Roe, you know where this is headed. Tammy Driscoll wants to break up with her overbearing boyfriend and an hour later she's dead? Phillip calls you, lies to you, why? Because he's trying to cover for his friend. We don't even know if Tammy got in Phillip's car. We need to find the guy on the skateboard and I'm calling in reinforcements. [ringing] Jason, hey, it's Roe. It's time for a Real Murders Club investigation. So the reservation is for... Oh, Carolyn, hi. Oh, Aida. How are you? I'm in the middle of a crisis at the moment. I suppose you've heard that Phillip is missing. Yes, I did. I'm sorry. Thank you. I've uh... I've been a little distracted. I just finished having a meeting with our lawyer. Oh, right. Clayton's gotten himself into a bit of trouble. Yeah. Right. Just-just a bit. Well, college hi-jinx aren't anything new. I'm sure everything's gonna turn out alright for him. Yeah. Aida I uh... I really have to go and deal with this mess. I'm sorry, I just-I have to go. Of course. Not a redhead in the bunch. But according to Tammy's class schedule I got from Portia this is her last class of the day. So what do we do now? Just wander around and hope to find this guy? We could start with the dorm. Come on. This isn't getting us anywhere. We could knock on a good 20, 30 doors before we get kicked out of here. Maybe we don't have to. Brian. Do you think this is him? Hey, sorry to intrude. Dude, are you ok? My friend was killed last night. Tammy and I were in the same study group. We were studying for this Spanish test we were supposed to have today. Uh, then this morning they cancelled it. I thought cool, I'll tell Tammy. But she didn't answer my text. I got coffee, the paper, went back to my room. I couldn't believe it. Tammy's dead. I just saw her yesterday. Brian, we think you may have been one of the last people to see Tammy alive. What? Oh, that's messed up. Did you talk to her? Uh... for like half a minute. I asked her if she was ready for the test, she teased me about how I was gonna fail and get kicked out of school, and then I said she should watch her karma for saying that. What about after that? We know she was waiting for her boyfriend to pick her up. Uh, yeah, Josh. I saw the car pull up, the one his roommate drives. So you saw her get into Phillip's car? Yeah. Josh got out of the front seat, said she could have it, but Tammy wanted to sit in the back. So Phillip was behind the wheel? Yeah. Tammy got in, they started to back out, and then... Then what? Nothing. Sorry, that's all I know. No Brian, you know something. You saw something. What was it? Please. Your friend is dead, but if you tell us what you know you might be able to help us save the others. Another car pulled in, parked next to the dark red one. A guy got out to talk to them. Did you recognize him? Brian, who was it? It was Clayton Harrison. Brian, you have to go to the police with this. I will. Ok, if Clayton Harrison was the last person to talk to Josh and Phillip we have to find him. We also have to tell Arthur. I have to go down to the police station anyway to get updates for my story. Good. You talk to Arthur. I know the Harrisons. Clayton doesn't live on campus so I'll go to their house and see if he's there. Or he could be around right now. Well, good. Then why don't you stay, Jason, and ask if anyone's seen him. If he's here I'll find him. Hey, how's it going? Do you know a guy named Clayton Harrison? Drives a BMW? Yeah, I know who you're talking about. Have you seen him around today? I'm kinda supposed to meet up with him. I don't keep track of the guy. Why don't you ask her? Marlee. That's his girlfriend. Thanks. Hey, are you Marlee? I'm trying to track down Clayton Harrison. How should I know where he is? Well, aren't you his girlfriend? Was his girlfriend. Was. We broke up a while ago, ok? Yeah. Oh, Nick. You're still here. Yeah, I was in the middle of talking to Detective Smith when he got a call and rushed out. Something's going on. Oh Arthur, I need to talk to you. Sorry, Sally, I gotta go. What happened? We just found Phillip Pifer's car. Where? [knocking] Roe. Hi, what can I- Carolyn, I am sorry to bother you, but is Clayton home? No, he's not. Do you know where he is? I have no idea. Have you seen him today? No, he left early this morning. What- Has he said anything about Phillip or Josh Farrell? You know they're missing, right? Yes, but what does that- Clayton was seen talking to Phillip and Josh yesterday, right before they disappeared. So are you insinuating that Clayton had something to do with this? [message alert] Sorry, one second. Oh my gosh. The police found Phillip's car. Can we finish this later? Arthur, please tell me you also found some sign of Phillip or Josh? Sorry, Roe. I've got officers combing the area but so far it's looking like the car was just abandoned here. Abandoned? What about the- Oh, I already asked if there was any sign that this was the car that hit Tammy Driscoll. We found no damage to the car or any other sign that it hit Tammy or caused her injuries. See? I knew it. I knew Phillip wouldn't just hit and run and- and leave a friend behind for dead. It was a ridiculous theory. No, it was a logical theory, but right now I have no replacement theory yet. Yeah, but it doesn't make any sense. Why would they just leave the car here? Where did they go? You told Arthur about Clayton Harrison, right? She did and I'm gonna question him. And take a look at his car. Yes Roe, I've got this. But right now we have a much bigger concern. (Aurora): Arthur, we have to find Phillip and Josh now. Let me help you with that. Oh, thank you. When I was at the police station I overheard that they had found your cousin's car? Yeah. And there was blood in the back seat. I mean, before I was just so certain that he was still alive somewhere but now I-I just... I don't know what to think. And I don't know how I'm gonna call Phillip's mom and tell her or tell my mother. I called Tammy's mother today. The Dean had already called her on behalf of the college but I just wanted to tell her how much I enjoyed having Tammy in my classes. That must have meant a lot to her. How is she? Shocked. Angry. Confused. They had never met Josh. They didn't even know Tammy was dating. She and her husband are flying out here. There-there's someone in my backyard. Wait! Nick! Wait! Wait! Don't hit him! I know him. So what's going on, Dan? Why were you lurking in my back yard? Caroline told me you came by asking about Clayton so I let myself in through the gate to wait for you. I'm sorry, but I didn't want your neighbors to see me. Why? What's going on? It's Clayton. He's missing, too. What? Why didn't you say anything? We have to call the police. No. No, no. You can't-you can't call the police. Yes, we can. Roe, Clayton's been kidnapped. And if you call the police he could die. And so could Phillip. You sure about that? No doubt in your mind? The kidnappers called me last night. They're demanding a half a million dollars for a safe return. That's why Caroline panicked when you were asking about him. We can't have the kidnappers thinking we're not cooperating with them. But they told you that Phillip and Josh are with them? No, but Clayton had told us that Phillip had invited him to his birthday dinner- Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. I- I was under the impression that Phillip and Clayton weren't speaking. I don't know what you mean. Phillip's been to the house a dozen times already since the semester started. He's been over to your house? Yes, and Clay told us that they were taking Tammy Driscoll to a hair appointment and then going to dinner, so when-so when Phillip and his friend came up missing I just assumed they were taken, too. These are bad people, Roe. And I don't think they would blink an eye at taking two extra victims. Did they identify themselves in any way? No, they just said they would call again tomorrow with instructions for a ransom drop tomorrow night. Ok, so if we tell the police they can trace that call. They said if I tell the police they'll kill him. I can't take that chance. If I give them the money I have to believe they will let him go. If Phillip and Josh were taken, too, then why has no one else been contacted with a ransom demand? I don't think they were the intended targets. They just got caught up in a net meant for Clayton. Like that poor girl. I want your word you won't tell the police about this. Yeah, but if they killed Tammy- You think they won't do the same thing to those boys? Our only chance at getting them back safely is for me to comply with the kidnapper's demands. That's it. Fine. I won't call the police. Thank you. I hope I don't regret that decision. Wha- Clayton kidnapped, and you honestly believe that these people took Phillip and his roommate, too? It's the best theory we have right now. But what about that phone call he made saying that he was sick? The kidnappers could have forced him to make that call, giving them more time to make them all disappear. I find it hard to believe that Phillip even invited Clayton to his birthday dinner. And yet, according to Dan, Phillip's at their house all the time. Well, if all of this is true then we have to go to the police. I gave them my word I wouldn't. Well, I made no such promise. Mother, if those people are willing to kill Tammy Driscoll and just drive away do you think they would hesitate to kill Clayton? Or Josh, or Phillip? I have to meet Nick. We're gonna go meet up with Sally and Jason and go over our next steps. Next steps? Aurora, you know I don't approve of your putting yourself in danger. This is your nephew we're talking about. And I know I can help. Well, what am I supposed to do? Just-just wait and- and wonder and worry? Actually there is a way you can help. Arthur had this dropped off earlier. See if you can figure out the password to Phillip's computer. I tried pet names and places I know Phillip likes, but maybe you can think of something else. As if he weren't going through enough already. Now you want me to violate his privacy? What if there's something on there that could help us find him? At least think about it. Bye. Hello Dan. Aida, what brings you here. Aurora tells me that Clayton is missing too? He's kidnapped? She shouldn't have told you anything. She certainly should have if- if whoever took Clayton has my nephew, too. I don't know that for sure. I read the story in the paper. Clayton splashing paint all over the sculpture that Dale Murphy donated to the college. This whole thing, this- this is all about the Murphy debacle, isn't it? That happened years ago, Aida. And yet here it is. Yesterday's news. Are you sure you don't wanna go to Arthur about Clayton? It doesn't feel right not getting his help. Believe me, she's been wrestling with this. My dad was a cop. I know what's at stake here, but I think Roe is right. Going to the police is too big a risk given what the kidnappers told Dan Harrison. No, I get it, I just don't like it, sitting, doing nothing. We don't have to do nothing. If I don't go to the police I'll feel responsible if something happens, so... I think we should follow Dan when he goes to drop off the ransom. You're kidding, right? No, it's actually a good idea. Or at least the best idea given the circumstances. Hey guys. You didn't tell me the Real Murders Club was getting together. Because you didn't want me to know. I wonder why. Because I'm the mayor and would be obligated to share what you're discussing with the police? Terry, I'm sorry. If I could tell you I would. I don't know whether to be relieved you have something to go on or worried that you're going around Arthur. We gotta be careful. These kids' lives are at stake. That's exactly why you should be going to the police. Are you sure Dan hasn't left to drop off the ransom yet? I watched him pull in after work, he hasn't left since. And no one's come by? Nobody, but maybe I should get a closer look, see what I can make out from the windows. Good idea. You're the most surprising librarian I've ever met. I doubt this is a typical evening for a college professor. No, but I have been on a few stake-outs before with my dad. Were you close to your dad? I was. Mmmhmm. Before the divorce, anyway. Oh. Yeah, I've been there. I hope your parents' split wasn't too rough. It was rough enough to make me interested in psychology. Figuring out why people do the things they do, especially when it seems so out of character. Yeah, that's the great mystery, isn't it? Was your parents' divorce tough? It was an amicable split, and I was nearly done with college. Still, it-it confused me, because if two people who seem to belong together can't make it work then... it made me skeptical of relationships and in no hurry to get married. Teagarden women are very independent. Clearly. And you? You're not married either? That's all I get? Miller men are very mysterious. Clearly. Oh. Harrison's getting in his car right now. Oh-get in. No, I don't think I should leave my vehicle here. I'll follow. That way if one of us loses him the other still has a shot. Ok. [phone vibrating] Yeah. Hey Jason, how well can you see Dan from where you are? I got a nice clear line of sight. I can see him going to his back door. He's got a red duffle bag. That's gotta be the money, right? Don't take your eyes off that bag. We can't see him. Can you? No, no, there's too many shadows. There he is. No bag. He must have left it in that back corner. He's gone. And now we just wait to see who gets that bag. And then follow them, right? Hopefully straight to our missing students. Why haven't they come for the money? Try to be still. They could be somewhere nearby watching to make sure it's all clear. There's a car pulling up behind us. No headlights, that's not good. Oh man. They're getting out. [knocking] [screams] Roe? Sally, what're you doing here? You told me you had to work tonight. Oh, I turned in my story. Jason texted me, told me you guys were here. Get in! Get in! You could have scared the kidnappers away. Just get down. You know, Roe, I think you're being a little bit bossy. I'm gonna go sit with Jason. What-don't move a muscle. Ok. Hi Nick. Hi Sally. Did we miss it? The kidnappers still haven't come to get the money. Are you sure? You stayed awake the whole two hours? Yeah, I-I think so. Pretty sure I stayed awake during my two hour watch. Well let's check, see if the bag's still here. No. No bag. Maybe Harrison was told to put the bag inside the dumpster. Just a bunch of newspapers. No bag. Are you guys positive Dan dropped it off? Yeah. Yeah, we saw him do it. So wait, the kidnappers came, took the bag, and we missed it? No. No, someone must have fallen asleep, that's the only explanation. Well, don't look at me. How do you know it wasn't you? Well obviously one of us fell asleep without knowing it. On the bright side if the kidnappers picked up the ransom maybe they've already released the guys. [sirens] Uh-oh. What're you doing here? I was just about to ask you the same thing. You informed her about the kidnapping before you told us? She was about to discover it on her own. I didn't want her to come to you too soon. I was trying to cooperate, give the money to the kidnappers so they'd let Clayton go. Wait a minute. They didn't release him? No, and I don't know why. I left the money right behind that dumpster. That might have been our fault. Tell me why it's your fault, Roe. We followed Dan, saw him drop off the ransom. We wanted to see the kidnappers, try to follow them. We-we watched all night. You what? What if they saw you? What-what if that's why they didn't let Clay go? No, no, that's not the reason why. They took the money. They-they have the money, so they should have released him. And Phillip and Josh. Well they didn't. And I blame you. You came to me. I- I'm trying to help. I didn't ask for this kind of help. Ok, you all need to go while we process the scene. You went too far this time, Roe. I'm disappointed in you. Well, I have a new story to write, one with no happy ending. I don't think I fell asleep. It was the right thing to try and find out who the kidnappers are. We have no idea why they didn't release Clayton or the others, assuming they're all together. It might have had nothing to do with us being here. Aurora? Where have you been all night? You should know that that cryptic text from you about a surveillance mission wasn't gonna keep me from worrying. You got in. So what was this mystery mission? Oh, it-it doesn't matter. We failed miserably. Hey, look at this. There's a folder with Clayton's name on it. And it's filled with papers from an English class I know Phillip isn't taking. It looks to me like Phillip's been writing papers for Clayton in exchange for money. That's where the $4,000 came from. And if he's been lying about this then what else has he been lying about? This could be why Clayton was really following Phillip the day they went missing. Or it's a clue to the identity of who took them. I don't think one thing has to do with the other. Why would you say that? Because I may know something about who kidnapped them. Thanks. Hey Terry. Jason. What're you guys up to? I found Jason brooding over his bacon and eggs. He told me what happened last night. I'm not the one who fell asleep. I've been carrying around your stories about Tammy and Clayton and the missing boys. We thought we'd go over them, see if it sparked any new ideas. Well I'd join you but I have to get back to work. Oh hey, Sally, wait. Take a look at this. Does it look like there's somebody in Clayton's car? I didn't notice anyone else in the car the night Clayton was arrested. Neither did I but I think I still have that photo on my phone. Yeah, there it is. Let me zoom in. [gasps] There is someone in the car and it looks like a girl. Yeah, she looks familiar. I think that might be Marlee Wilson. Who? It's Clayton's girlfriend, but she told me they broke up a while back. Well if they broke up why is she sitting in the car with him? And I don't care if it's his day off, get him in here. We need to get a tap on Harrison's phone ASAP. Arthur. You need to listen to what my mother has to say. Roe, it'll have to wait. Right now I've gotta deal with some- No, my father, he used to work with Dan Harrison at the investment company and something happened that I think you should know about. Mother, tell him. One of their first clients was a man named Dale Murphy and it was Dan Harrison who managed Murphy's investments, but he made some serious mistakes. Murphy lost millions, almost went under. He vowed that he would make Dan regret it. Ok, yes. Dale Murphy. He's the one who donated the sculpture that Clayton was arrested for defacing. Yes. So we got into Phillip's laptop and I found an application essay for an internship at Murphy Industries with Clayton's name on it. I think Clayton hired Phillip to do some writing for him. Clayton probably didn't know about the bad blood between his father and Murphy but I am quite sure Dale Murphy would not have offered an internship to Dan Harrison's son. Which is probably why Clayton poured that paint on the sculpture but in doing so it made him a target for Murphy to get revenge on Dan. Arthur I have seen Dale Murphy's theatrics. This is a dangerous man. Ok, first I know about the bad investment. Dan Harrison told me all about it this morning. And I plan to talk to Murphy as soon as I get a chance, but right now I need to go tell Darlene Farrell that it was Josh's blood that we found in the back of Phillip's car. Oh, no. What does that mean? Nothing good. For now, thanks for coming in. I'll follow up if I have any questions about Murphy or about what else might be on Phillip's computer. Josh's blood in Phillip's car? The boys still missing? Arthur's gotta take Dale Murphy more seriously. Yeah, well if Arthur isn't gonna go talk to Dale Murphy right now, I mean, it doesn't mean we can't. No. Absolutely not. That is not what I was suggesting. It is not up to us to question Dale Murphy. But what if your theory is right and he's holding Phillip and Josh and Clayton hostage right this very minute? Well then that makes it even more dangerous for us to confront him. I'm not talking about meeting him in a dark alley, I'm just gonna go see if he's in his office. It's ok, you don't have to go with me. No. I absolutely forbid you to go down there by yourself. Ok, I won't. Now you're talking sense. I'll call Nick. He'll go with me. [knocking] Hello? Hi. Yeah? Uh, you must be Larissa. We're looking for Marlee Wilson. Yeah, well, she's not here. Sorry. Wait. If you're her roommate you must know... is she still Clayton Harrison's girlfriend? I don't see how that's any of your business. Oh, I should introduce myself. I'm Sally Allison. I'm with the Lawrenceton Times. I'm doing a story on Clayton's disappearance so naturally I wanted to interview his girlfriend. Marlee told me they broke up. Well she didn't tell me that but I wouldn't be surprised. What makes you say that? Because yesterday she suddenly packed up, said she was dropping out of school and going to Europe for a new job. What new job? With what company? I don't know. She didn't say. But I remember her applying for an internship at Murphy Industries. Hey, what're you two doing here? Oh, long story, starting with that photo that I took the night Clayton was arrested. What about you guys? We're waiting for Dale Murphy. His assistant's on the way. Now, about that photo? Oh. Look closely, there's someone in the car with Clayton. I understand you've asked to see Mr. Murphy? Yes. There will be four of us now. I'm sorry but Mr. Murphy isn't in the office today. Well why didn't the receptionist just tell us that in the first place? Leave your contact information and I'll make sure he gets in touch with you. I think he's here. I think you're right. What're you doing up here? That's him. That's Dale Murphy. You said he wasn't here. What's he driving? Grey Land Rover. Go. [phone ringing] Hello? Roe, it's me, Phillip. Phillip! Oh my gosh, where are you? Phillip, are you there? Yes, sorry. I'm afraid they can hear me. Phillip, what's going on? [groans] Phillip, are you ok? [groans] Did he say Josh was with him? Is he ok? Well, before he could say anything really there was a yell and then the sound of a struggle and then the call dropped. But if Phillip's alive then there's a good chance Josh is, too. And Clayton. Yes, but Phillip might have put their lives in jeopardy with a stunt like that. I think he was brave to try to call for help. Ok so it seems the phone used to call you was a burner phone, it's an untraceable number, there's no way to tell where the call came from. I bet you that phone was bought by Dale Murphy. Everything is pointing to a revenge kidnapping, Arthur. Murphy literally ran out the back door when we tried to talk to him. You tried to talk to Murphy? After I told you not to? We found out that Clayton's girlfriend Marlee suddenly dropped out of school and left town right after interviewing at Murphy Industries. Marlee and Clayton tried to get a summer internship together there. You didn't think to tell Clayton about your history with Murphy? Well, if he had told me his plan I would have. You told me years ago that you had settled everything with Dale Murphy. I didn't want you to worry. Well, Clayton has tried for years to escape your shadow. He just wanted you to be proud of that internship. Marlee and Clayton broke up. Maybe she was angry about it then. Angry enough to help Murphy lure Clayton into a trap. Maybe that's why she was in the car with Clayton the night he was arrested. To set up the trap. Can I see that, Sally? Clayton didn't tell us why they broke up but there's- there's no way. I cannot imagine Marlee ever wanting to hurt him. Well she could have been promised that he wouldn't get hurt. You know, the first time I talked to Murphy after the whole statue incident, he didn't seem to mind the idea of Clayton being hurt at all. I knew Murphy would come after me someday, but I never dreamed it would be something like this. Yeah, well, Clayton's stunt with the statue might have put Murphy over the edge. From everything my mother has told me he's never been a stable man. Ok, look, we'll get a team to your house by 7:00 tonight to put a tap on the phone in case the kidnappers call again. 7:00. Yes, thank you. In the meantime we're still searching for Clayton's car and I will track down Murphy. I'll get in touch if I find out anything. Thank you for telling us about the call. It gives me hope. Well keep hoping because we are never gonna give up looking. I wanna talk to that Brian kid again. The one who told us he saw Clayton talking to Phillip. Yes. Maybe he can confirm whether Marlee Wilson was in the car with Clayton that day, too. Excuse me, but what is this? What are you people doing? We're trying to help find the boys. Well, I think you should stop and let the police handle it. Yes. Yeah, I agree. I think Detective Smith is doing a very fine job. Well, I-I think so, too, and I'm glad you changed your mind about calling him, Dan. Well, I didn't have much choice. Once I had to tell you that Clayton had been kidnapped, well I knew it wouldn't be a secret for long. Now, if you'll excuse us, we're going home and wait for the kidnappers to call us. Again. Caroline. Well I'm gonna talk to Brian. What is it? Not here. Did you two hear what Dan said in there? He was expecting me to go to the police and tell them about Clayton's kidnapping even though I promised not to. So he has trust issues. So what? So Dan dropped off the ransom expecting the police to be watching him? Exactly. Ok so wait. We were wrong to assume that one of us fell asleep? Or to even think that he dropped that money off at all. Remember there were newspapers at the bottom of the dumpster? Maybe the duffel bag that we saw him take out of his car was full of those newspapers. And then he ditched the papers. And folded up the duffel bag and hid it under his coat. Ok, but why would he do that? To cover up the fact that he kidnapped Clayton himself. What are you saying? Yeah, that's pretty far out there. No. Remember we had a guest speaker at Real Murders last year. The lead investigator on the Railey case. Ok, yes. Ok, so Winifred Railey hid her son with a friend and pretended that he was kidnapped in order to get ransom money from her husband. But that doesn't make sense here because Dan Harrison already has money. Yeah, maybe he has a gambling problem, or-or needs a way to pay off a debt without his wife knowing about it. Or make good on bad investment advice to a client. I mean, there could be a dozen reason why he might need to make his own money disappear. How do we find out if he did that? We need to find the red duffel bag. We need to get into the Harrisons' house. And I know just the person who's gonna help us do it. Of course I didn't wanna talk to Charles Teagarden's intrusive daughter. Teagarden's business partner, Dan Harrison, nearly ruined me. Why would I wanna speak to any of them? So you do hold a grudge. Mr. Murphy, what can you tell me about Clayton Harrison's kidnapping? Kidnapped? Harrison's boy? We believe he was abducted outside the Shear Delight hair salon. You wouldn't think a thing like that could happen around here. I... what can I do to help? Well, first you can tell me if you ever hired an intern by the name of Marlee Wilson. Hey Brian, how you doin'? Hey. Uh, sorry. Gotta get to class. Just hold up a sec. I need to ask you a quick question. No time, already late. Wait, are you running from me? No. No, I'm not gonna do it. I won't. Mother, this might be our best shot at finding Phillip. I'm not one of your Real Murders members. You-you can't talk me into interfering with what should be police business. I can't believe I even let you talk me into this scheme. It'll be fine. We'll go in, chat for a bit, I'll duck away for a few minutes, poke around some closets, see if I can find the duffel bag. For goodness sake, there are probably 18 closets in a house this size. And why would she even let us in the front door? No, I think we should just turn around and- Caroline, when Aurora told me about Clayton, I mean, we just had to come by and-and share our support. I think it would do us all some good. May we come in? No. No, I'm sorry, Dan had to run out and we're expecting the police very soon regarding the phones and I'm really not feeling very well at all. No, of course you don't. We completely understand. Which is why we'll make it quick. Trust me, this cake is almost as good as medicine. I... Ok, Roe talked her way in. She sure is something. [knocking] Can I help you? Are you Karen Wilson? Mmmhmm. I'm Detective Arthur Smith, Lawrenceton PD. I have a few questions for you about your daughter, Marlee. Oh. What do you wanna know? You really don't wanna talk to me, and I'm wondering why. Because everything that's happened, Josh and Phillip disappearing, Tammy getting killed... it's all my fault. Roe, why don't you let me do that? Oh, I don't mind at all. Please sit. Thank you. I love what you've done to this kitchen, Caroline. Those countertops, they're gorgeous. Thank you. Dan's choice. I can't help but think about Phillip and Clayton, when they were little, playing together here. They'd run off and go down to that wonderful playroom of yours. Hmm-mm, they played a lot of video games, didn't they? [laughs] Yeah. Um, do you have sugar on the counter? Oh, yes. Oh no, no, I'll get it. I'll get it. Excuse me while I use the bathroom? Oh, uh, sure. It's just down the hall. Why do you think everything that happened is your fault? That day at the parking lot, the day it all went down, I saw Clayton and Marlee pull up next to Phillip. So Marlee was with Clayton. Clayton had told Phillip about trashing the statue. Bragged about it. I saw him get out of his car. I heard him yelling at Phillip, blaming Phillip for ratting him out. For getting him arrested. I heard Phillip say it wasn't him, but Clayton just kept calling him a liar and when Phillip's car pulled out Clayton jumped back in his car and started chasing him like a crazy person, trying to run him off the road. Wow. Ok, but I still don't see how any of that is your fault. It's my fault because I was the one with Clayton the night he vandalized the statue. Afterwards I just felt so guilty about what we'd done and... I don't know. I felt like I had to confess. The Dean gave me probation for coming forward and I had no idea Clayton was already in trouble for doing a bunch of other stuff, that he'd get expelled. That day at the parking lot, when Clayton was blaming the wrong guy, I just stood there not saying a word. [laughs] No, I'm pretty sure that Marlee did not break up with Clayton. After all, he just gave her a car. A car? What car? It's right through here. So this is Clayton's car? Mmmhmm. How long has it been sitting in your garage? Three or four days. And you didn't think to call us when the news of his kidnapping broke? What? Kid-kidnapping? Wait, are you saying that Clayton's been kidnapped? Marlee said that Clayton hit a deer. Ok, whatever you do, do not touch or drive this vehicle. It's evidence of a crime. Yeah, I got it. I'm heading to the Harrison house now. [phone ringing] Roe? What's going on? I found pizza boxes in the recycling bin. Pizza boxes? Yeah, and not just one or two. Five. Do you mean like enough pizza boxes to feed a bunch of hungry college students? Yes. I think Phillip and Josh might be here. I'm gonna check downstairs. Oh Roe, be careful. I will. Bye. Phillip? Hey, Roe? Is that-help us! Help us, Roe! Oh my gosh! Yeah, I'm gonna get you out. [click] You shouldn't have come down here. Clayton... Clayton, you have to let them go. Let Phillip go, let Josh go. I can't do that. Not yet. So how do you like the cake, Caroline? Mmm, it's delicious. You know, I wonder what's keeping Aurora. I think I'll go check on her. I'm sure she's fine. Oh, I see we have a visitor. Dan. What's the occasion? Oh, well they brought cake. Yeah. I don't like that Dan Harrison's there now. We should go break up that little party. Ok, wait. After all the trouble they went through to get in there shouldn't we give Roe a little bit more time to find that duffel bag? I- Just don't move. Clayton, what happened? Why are you doing this? You are the one that hit Tammy. I didn't mean to. I didn't see her. I- I was catching up with Phillip 'cause I was angry at him. I never should have told him what I did to that statue and Marlee was distracting me and-and Tammy, she just-she just ran out in front of me and I didn't have time to stop or turn. It wasn't my fault. It just got out of control so fast. I was telling Caroline earlier that I just love these countertops and... [message alert] she said that they were your choice. Is everything ok? Oh yeah, everything's fine. [message alert] Ok. Ok, you're going in the room with them. Take the key, unlock it, don't try anything. You must have had the gun in the car with you that day. That's how you got Phillip and Josh to come home with you. Hurry up. I hate this. I hate this whole thing. You were in their car, Marlee was in yours, but why did you bring them all here? Because he does whatever his father tells him to, that's why! Shut up, Phillip! How long did you plan on keeping them down here? You're taking too long. Give me the key back. Yeah, I can't. It's uh, it's stuck. Move. It's just until my passport gets here. That's why your father claimed to have paid a half a million dollars in ransom money. He needed to make that money disappear so he could finance your escape to Europe. Seems like your dad hasn't told you yet that the police are coming tonight to tap the phones. What? [scuffling sounds] [gunshot] Aurora! Aida! That sounded like a gunshot. Oh, oh! [groans] Caroline, put our things in the car. We're leaving now. No I won't, this has gone far enough. This has to stop. Just do it. Dan. Dan, I've known you 25 years. This isn't you. You think I don't know that? But I am not about to watch my son rot in prison over an accident. You're going downstairs, Aida. Just for a couple hours, alright? This is over! Now! Oh! Oh!!! Don't make this worse, Phillip. Please! Put the gun down. Please! Dan, you need to let my mother go. What's going on? We heard a gunshot! We have Clayton downstairs so please put the gun down. Not until I get my family outta here. [grunts] Police! What? I live alone. I... I've taken one or two self-defense classes. Nice work. Harrison, stay down. Roll over. Hands where I can see them. I'm so sorry. Yeah, sure. You, mister. You have a lot of explaining to do. Writing papers for other students is not an acceptable way to work your way through college. Yeah, it's definitely not my best idea. But right now I am just so relieved that you're in one piece. Oh, we have to call your mom and let her know that you're ok. And I know a great stylist if you ever wanna get that haircut. Maybe tomorrow. Call your mom. Josh? I was so worried about you. Are you hurt? They found blood in the car. I'm fine, mom. I cut myself in the fight with Clayton when he forced us into his car. Can we just go home now, please? Yes, of course we can. I have had some good neighbors but none like you. It's nice, you showing up. Is your life always so interesting? Well, you live right across the street, I guess you'll find out. I knew she was ready.
