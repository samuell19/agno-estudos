We want freedom! We want freedom! -We want to leave India! -We want freedom! Even if you shoot us! Even if you jail us! Even if you beat us up! -We will show them! -We want freedom! Let's see your shoes. Very well. Come with me. Rafiq! What are you doing here? All well? Is your father with you? Everything all right? I left my bag behind. Men and children, step out and line up. Go on. Move up. He is with me. My son. Whatever is happening, you are not responsible for it. Then who will take responsibility? Will you? Does anyone even listen to you when you are in uniform? It's time for prayer. Get up. Your father will be late for work. Get some bread. Come on. Hurry up now. Leave some money for vegetables and milk. What's taking Rafiq so long? Ghulam Rasool's been here twice. He was looking for you. I had to make an excuse. I said you were unwell. What's the harm if he is giving you work? Let's go, Salima. Won't you come along? Is the tea all right? It needs more salt. Add some yourself. Welcome back, sir. How are things? How was the journey? All well at home? This is Radio Kashmir. You will now hear the news from Abdul Hasar. The union government today announced the commencement of cellular phone service in Jammu and Kashmir. Clearances from the Ministries of Home Affairs and Defense are expected soon. A government spokesman, addressing the press in Srinagar, said that the SIM cards will be activated on the day of the Eid festival. Separatist leaders met the foreign secretary of Pakistan in Delhi today. Earlier they had an extensive discussion about Kashmir with the US ambassador. A spokesperson for the separatists said that Indo-Pak talks cannot go ahead... Matches, please. ...without considering the wishes of the people of Kashmir. Here you are, sir. These shoes are perfect for football. Sajid! Where's the tea? In a moment. He was your recommendation. Do you realize the trouble it caused? I had to go house to house to make deliveries. I had no idea who read which newspaper. If I hire a new boy, it'll take him a month to figure it out. Not reading a newspaper for two days won't kill anyone. He'll come tomorrow. It's not just a matter of two days. This is about daily delivery. Don't sweat it. He will come starting tomorrow. Come here. I have given him my word. You will show up, right? Let's go. All right, Ghulam Rasool. Come on. Get up. Get up and say your prayers. You will be late for work. Get up. O world, full of regret No one ever found happiness here Look who all Have ended up in the grave O world, full of regret Why are you wasting your singing talent? Call the TV show Who Wants To Be a Superstar? Will you send me an SMS vote? They are starting a cellular service in Kashmir. Kashmiris will vote for you. Kashmiris have never voted in an election. Why would they vote for me? Don't worry. I will vote for you. The SIM cards will be activated on the day of Eid. A government sop for us. An Eid gift. Come on. Sing us a film song. This "World of Regret" is not going to impress them. No, man. My throat is parched. Let's have tea at Sajid's first. Get up now. Let's go. Rafiq. Let's go. Get up, you zombie. Always sleeping. He is never going to vote for you, Ishaq. Ishaq! Ishaq! Hey! Stop! Stop! Wow. He's glowing. What's up, guys? I told you to come with me. I'll show you the life. -Cool jacket. -Pants too. New bike? You will get a bike. Jacket too. Lots of other stuff. -Coming? -Sure! Let us ride the bike first. Not now. I'm in a hurry. But do come and visit me. Just one ride! Stop! Fucking pimp. Full of dirty money. Riding his dad's money. Show-off! Nice stroke! What are you doing, my friend? What are you doing? Come on, man. Go on. Can't you see? Go and get the ball. Pass the ball. Hey! Back off! Let it go. Leave it. Take him home. Have you lost your mind? Do you know who he is? His cousin is a militant commander. I don't give a shit. Aslam, go get the ball. Get it yourself. My shoes are ripped up in all this mess. If Kashmir were independent, we would have been playing World Cup qualifiers. We... are here. We will have to play against India. Pakistan. Both of them are busy with cricket. Afghanistan. They won't be able to put a team together. That leaves China. Our main challenger. China won't play ball with us. They'll kick us around like a football. America won't let that happen. Why would they bother? We don't even have oil. But there is going to be a water shortage. I saw it on Nat Geo. Ten years from now, a bottle of water will cost 50 bucks. When did you start watching these channels? I thought you only watched countdown shows. What do you know? America has their own satellites. They are watching the whole world. Who knows, they may be tapping our conversation right now. What was that? Rafiq, come here. Rafiq, let's get out of here! Quiet! What are you doing? No, Ishaq. Let's go! Shut up and stay down! Aslam, stay here. Rafiq, let's go! Let's get out of here. It's not safe here. Rafiq, come on! Rafiq, let's go. Come on now. Let's go! Easy now. Quietly now. Doctors say that Shamim Ahmed's condition is stable but still critical. The Kashmir Times' bureau chief was abducted by unknown gunmen four days ago. He managed to escape from his captors and reached the emergency ward at SMHS Hospital on his own this evening. No organization has yet claimed responsibility for the incident. Today the chief of public works, Mohamed Altaf Ghanai... Rafiq. You should get home on time. Your mother is worried sick about you. With reference to this, Mohamed Altaf Ghanai met with the people and said that the government will ensure that the road work gets completed as early as possible. -Come eat dinner. -I'm not hungry. It is also said that by starting the road work, the local public will get employment opportunities, and at the same time the infrastructure will be improved. Public announcement: Please assemble together. This is a request from security forces to come to the school grounds for a police lineup. All males in the neighborhood are requested to assemble at the school grounds for a police lineup. Rafiq, clean your room. I should never have come back to this hell. Why are you so mournful? If you'd have learned to mourn, you would not be in such agony. Show me your brother's grave. I will mourn then. Do you know what it's like to outlive your child? If Tauqir had become a militant, I would have understood. But he was a nobody! And how am I at fault? Don't I at least have the right to bury my own son? And I won't rest until I know for sure. If you want to mourn, go ahead. She lives in our neighborhood. The army picked her brother up too. Your mother might know her. She also goes to APDP meetings. I'll accompany you tomorrow. To the meeting. -How many "disappeared," according to you? -8,000 to 10,000. We want the Indian government to say where our children are. We don't want money or jobs. We want to see our children. We don't want anything else. If our children are alive, in prisons, let us meet with them. If they are not alive, then declare them dead. The government knows their security forces have taken them. The army tells us nothing. Every time there is a case filed against them, there is a cover-up. Ramzan. Hey. Move it. Rafiq! Rafiq! -What happened? -Rafiq! Why are you screaming? Where is Rafiq? Where is he? -Where is this blood from? -Father. What happened? God have mercy. Mercy! His hands were trembling with fear. His eyes were crying out for help. Asking me to save him somehow. He must've been Rafiq's age. I couldn't do anything. Nothing. FREEDOM Your cap. Uncle! Four skewers, please. Shame on you. You're going to Delhi now. Uncle, make that eight. Go sit inside. All right, Uncle. He's got his stomach hanging out, like Nazir the Pot. Nazir who? When Nazir the Pot became a government minister, they asked him, "Sir, what would you like to do first, breakfast, or use the toilet?" He said, "Bring me a bit of both." How is he related to you? He isn't yet. Maybe someday he'll be my brother-in-law. Hey, "World of Regret," eat. No, he is like cotton candy. Those who eat regret it as much as those who don't. Rafiq, let's go. Aslam is hurt. Slow... Slow down. Easy. It will be all right. Stop! Stop. I'm feeling dizzy. Stop, stop. Yes, Rafiq! Stop him! Stop him! Come on. Come on. Nothing will happen to you. Hold on. Wait a minute. Get in. Sajid. You'll have to face the Almighty someday. Why not add some milk to the tea occasionally? Face the Almighty? We are doing God a favor by not committing suicide. I'm leaving for Jalandhar tomorrow. One tea. Will you go sell shawls in 104-degree heat? That heat is better than this hell any day. Here's your tea. Bring it here. Put it here. Want some tea? So you take pictures? So what do they need? Okay. All right. So how much are they offering? Then tell them to figure it out in Delhi itself. We know what happens in the field. We face the music out there. Tell them we get $250 per photograph. Yeah. Tell them to talk to us directly then. Right. What do you want? Mr. Shamim must have spoken to you, called you... Mr. Shamim? Yeah, he thinks this is a government school. Do you know how to make tea? Charge the battery. Mr. Siraj had asked me to take the parcel for... Charge the battery first. Cell phones will be very useful for school and business. How are you feeling? Feels great. The mobile phones are here. But do you think it'll make a difference in your life? Of course it'll make a difference. Say when we leave home early for work, there could be a blast or we might get caught in a cross fire. The folks at home won't know. The best thing is we can stay in touch with our families. And this means safety for everyone. We can go to work without stress. We can stay in touch with friends and family. We are really happy that mobile phones are finally here. I quit. Get out of here, you bastard. I was doing you a favor. I can get thousands like you. Nonsense. Useless fellow. I've got a proper job. Thank God. Did you thank Ghulam Rasool? Has Father had his medicine? We will have to take him elsewhere. This drug just knocks him out. Salima was saying there are good doctors at the mental hospital. We should take him there. Come on. Rafiq, find out where you get the forms. Sit down here. What are you up to? Tea? If this is what you wanted, you could've worked for Sajid instead. This is rusting too. -Pick it up. Come with me. -Where? -Just pick it up. -But where? -Come with me. -Where? Come on, cotton candy. Take my picture. This doesn't have film in it. Not that one! That's Mr. Siraj's. Nothing will happen. Take it. Tomorrow, when I am a star, you'll become famous too. -Did you get a reply from the show? -Yes. I'm off to Delhi for north zone qualifiers. Now say, "Who is going to be a superstar?" What's this back-and-forth? Just click, man. Go back a little. Where will I go? You step back. How's my hair? Are my shoes in frame? -Hey, what happened? Hold on. -I'll see you tomorrow. Fucking swine. Do I look like a tourist photographer to you? Is this what you've come here to learn? Here. Take this to your lord and master. Good-for-nothing. So what is your advice? Should we wait for a better offer? I was hoping we will be done during this trip. We can't possibly keep coming back. Did you speak to Mr. Hafiz? He's not willing to go above 2.8 million. He knows it is a distress sale. Mr. Kaul, this is Arundhati, a TV journalist from Delhi. Mr. Kaul is my mentor. His son Rajesh. He has come from Delhi to sell their ancestral house. I am today content with my struggle outside Kashmir. Because I don't fear for my life everyday. What about you, Rafiq? Do you know any Kashmiri Pandit? What have you got there? Mr. Siraj sent this for you. Aren't you buying a cell phone? You qualify for the show first. If I don't qualify, I won't come back. Let's take a picture of you. Wait a minute. Let me strike a pose first. Now what? Give Father his medicine. Father. Where is he? Check in the storeroom. Father, your medicine. All set for the Eid festival? Performing the sacrifice? This is from your bag. I'll return your money. No problem. -Who is in there? -He's a friend. -At this hour? -Don't worry. Go back to sleep. -Rafiq's friend. -So late? It's all right. Go back to sleep. Sleep now. You've taken these pictures? That's Shaheen. Ever since my first militant action, I can't sleep at night. Every night before going to sleep, I try hard to dream about my mother. But I only ever see scary faces. I'm sure your mother dreams of you all the time. One thing is certain. The path to paradise does not go via Pakistan. How is Pervez? Hey. Hands up! Can't you hear? Hands up, I say! I need your help. I can't go home. Give this to my mother. Rafiq, your father has wandered out somewhere. Go look for him! Oh, my Lord! Oh, my Rafiq! Alas, my Rafiq!
