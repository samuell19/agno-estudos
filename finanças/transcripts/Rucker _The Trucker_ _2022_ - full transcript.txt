No. Yeah, know I taught my buddy Taco Tuesday how to do it, and he's got some real nice pieces now. It helps to pass the time away. Especially when you can't sleep at night. Who's that? That, that's my wife, Darlene. She's a real looker, ain't she? That was back in '85. She don't go out on the road with me no more. Yeah. I was gonna make a traveling museum out of them. I guess I just didn't finish 'em. You know, it's hard finishing things when you're out on the road. Yeah, it's hard being on the road alone. I just got tired of it. You know, hard to finish things when you're out on the road for so long. Little mice and their tales and such. You ever skin a mouse? They's a bitch. Excuse my language. What about kids? No, me and Darlene never wanted to have kids. Look at that. Look. Pretty, ain't it? You're only as good as you couplings. You gotta be detail-oriented. I start with suspension, brakes, fuel area, drive shaft, frame, tires. No, you can't have family out on the road. Yeah, a lot have tried. But me, all I need is her. She's dependable. Yeah, very dependable. What's that? Yeah. Rucker Trucker. How's it look? Yeah? I like that. Hmm. - Hey, folks. - Hello. - Some menus for y'all. - Thank you. - Gonna have some coffee? - Oh, please. - Thank you. - Yeah. Oh, the coffee here is good. - Thank you. - Ah, how long - you been working here? - 18 years. Oh, no wonder. I'm sure they keep you around to pretty the place up. Aren't you nice. Let's see here. Um, ooh, Spanish omelet. That sounds exotic. I ain't never had one of those before. - I'll have that. - Absolutely. Hey, boys! Hey. Give me a second. Check this out. What is your contribution to society as trackers? My contribution to society. Hmm. There's one. - Truckin's real important. - That coffee you're drinking, - it got here by truck. - True, it did get to the US on a plane, but it got here on a truck. What he means is the world wouldn't work without us driving truck. People just, they don't seem to realize what is going on underneath. All they do is they just keep buying up everything that we bring to them on the backs of our trucks. I mean really this whole fucking diner wouldn't be here if it weren't for trucks. How long have you known each other? I've known Loverboy for what? - Is it about 10 years now? - Yeah, yeah, oh yeah. 10 years, yeah. - Yeah, about the same, yeah. - Mm-hmm. Did, uh, Loverboy tell you he's the one that taught me how to crochet? It keeps me calm. Let's see. Look at that guys. - Mm. - That's nice. I don't wanna brag, but, you know, the student has surpassed the master. Oh! - Really pretty. - Thank you, guys. - Thank you. - That's nice fucking work. It's for my daughter. She, uh, she don't go for any of that frilly stuff. Feel that. Mm-hmm. - You all right? - Yeah. Yeah? That was, that was quick. Pretty good at that camera stuff. Must have been a daddy's girl. Hmm. They call me Corndog because I'm beautiful. Mm-hmm. Meat on a stick, wrapped in cornbread. Yeah, that's beautiful. That's beautiful. I got my handle from my wife. "King Mojo." She's my dungeon master. We play Dungeons and Dragons. I got that one. Go on. Tell her, Taco. I, My handle comes from a moment I'm not proud of, but it reminds me that I'm a better person. See, um, I made a big stink at truck stop. They didn't have no tacos. I want my fucking tacos! Motherfucking tacos! Cock sucking, fucking, motherfucking ta, tacos! I wanted tacos. Been on the road for awhile, too many loads in a row. I hadn't been home. It was a Wednesday. It wasn't even Taco Tuesday. They didn't have anything on the premises that looked like a taco. My real name's Enus. Do the math. Okay, here we go. That's it. Ooh, hey. Sir, sir. You have a load on my truck still. Right there, "No Unload." Read that? Yeah, I don't have anybody to unload this. My guy called in sick. I have got another load that is behind yours. You need to get your load off my truck. Hey, what's this? Hey, turn that off. No, no, no. She's with me. I don't give a shit. Get your stuff off that truck and get out of here. - And turn that off. - No. You get your load off of my truck. And that's how you deal with crackerheads. ♪ This is the last time I ride ♪ ♪ But then I say that every night ♪ Loverboy's always been my handle. 'Cause I'm a romantic. ♪ For something that might put me in my grave. ♪ Got a gator ahead. Hammer lane. Copy that. Taco Tuesday, is that you? Loverboy? Howdy! Hey, hey! Hey, how'd your girl like that hat? Real nice. Thank you. That is good. That's good. Hey, here. Take it. Oh, you need a handle now. What is it? Um, how about Daddy's Girl? I like that. I ain't never heard that before. Say, "This is Daddy's Girl. Keep it shiny side up, Taco Tuesday." This is Daddy's Girl. Keep it shiny side up, Taco Tuesday. Now let go of the button. Roger that, Daddy's Girl. I love places like this. All them things going around in circles and I'm not driving 'em. You know, a man should not be a burden to a woman. He should clean up after himself. Do you think Darlene appreciated that? Darlene's the best thing ever happened to me. Good woman. She's kind. Yeah. I don't think I could be the man I am without her. I'm gonna make her... - I'm making her a gift. - A what? I'm making her a gift. You know, something that I can show her, to just, just to show her how much she means to me. I wouldn't be the man I am today if not for her. Okay. And what kind of man is that? This got a spot on it. Yeah, I like to have everything nice and neat. Orderly. That way if anything gets out of place, I know it. Yeah. That's Darlene's. I keep it from when she used to ride with me. She likes to look pretty. That's from '85. She don't ride with me no more. When I was kid, my mom used to make me take piano lessons and drawing lessons. I think she may, wanted to make me an artist I wasn't that good at it. Is that a knitting book? No. So you know... Show you something. All those tiny little dots. And all the little dots are making up all the people and their pretty faces. Look at this. Just imagine how long it took to make all them dots. Each little dot. Imagine all the pretty faces. Let me show you something. I'm working on this part right here, right now. Be finished with it soon. And each one of these dots is a truckload and all the lines in-between, all the stops. ♪ Holding you ♪ Right here, I had to, I had to redo all this 'cause, you know, I just couldn't get the bridge right. Darlene's nose like turns up real cute, like at the end. So I had to redo it. That was, um, 28 years of my life, I've been working on this portrait. And when I'm done with it, I'm gonna give it to Darlene. - Excuse me. - Yeah, oh. Okay. So what'll y'all have? Um... Ooh, Spanish omelet. That sounds exotic, don't it? I ain't never had a Spanish omelet. - I'm gonna have that. - It's real good. Yeah. Are, are we rolling? Like shooting? It's lonely out there on the road. It can be. In my opinion, darling, it don't hurt nobody to go after intimacy. It's important to feel loved. Appreciated. Their families, they don't understand what it's like out there, alone on the road. You gotta love where you can. I love Darlene. I'm not saying you don't love your wife. I'm just saying it's important to feel loved. You're giving yourself a gift when you care for someone so much, so much that they love you back. - Come on. - In there? I need your help. Come on. Okay. Now right here is where we are today. Shh! Is that Darlene? No, this is not Darlene. It looks a lot like her but Darlene is much prettier. Lining up the truckloads, that was the hard part. I spent 28 years of my life creating this here portrait. And it's to prove that I ain't a quitter and I ain't givin' up. Do you want me to show you how I do it? Pay attention. This is how I do it. Where did you get the idea to bury bodies in fresh graves? Did you see it in a movie or something? No. I was just walking around, saw someone doing it. Doing this? Yeah. That's right. You saw someone burying a body in a fresh grave? Yes. That's how I got the idea for this. You said before that you didn't have kids. I don't have kids. I have just one kid. - Do you have kids? - No. Daddy. I haven't been called that in years. Sorry, Daddy. I lost my first tooth today. It bled a lot. Will I lose all of my teeth? Will I look like Grandma? What if my new teeth don't grow? I call 'em Darlene's Dots. Darlene's a complicated gal. Some women, they just ain't so complicated. So these women look like Darlene? No, Darlene's different. You know, the difficult part is finding little pieces of Darlene inside of 'em. That what makes 'em a good dot. Let me go! Let me go! Uh! Let me go! Let me go! Why don't you pick women that look like Darlene? Because she's one of a kind. Huh! You impotent or something? Is this what you do to get it up? Huh? But you make them up to look like her. No, I'm looking for parts of Darlene in each of them. Your wife not doing it for you anymore? Are you trying to kill those parts? - I- - Metaphorically speaking? I just wanna know why she left me. She kick you out? Do you think Darlene left for a reason? I still lover her, you know? What will you do when she takes you back? Give up killing. How did the Dots make you feel about yourself? Do they make you feel good about yourself? How did Darlene make you feel? Did Darlene make you feel good about yourself? You know, we're done... I killed someone. I killed someone close to me. Then that's crossing the line, little lady. She had cancer. So it was a mercy killing. Yeah. You afraid of getting caught? Do you ever think about that? No. Not much. ♪ Now, yeah ♪ ♪ You're my obsession ♪ ♪ Who do you want me to be ♪ ♪ To make you sleep with me ♪ ♪ Woo, yeah ♪ ♪ You're my obsess ♪ ♪ Who do you want me to ♪ ♪ To make you sleep with me ♪ ♪ You are an obsession ♪ ♪ You're my obsession ♪ Taco Tuesday!

The problem with truckers is that they're always on the road. Well, I guess they wouldn't be truckers if they weren't on the road. Anyway, how can you have a real family with someone who's never there? No offense, honey. And how would you feel if your husband or boyfriend or daddy was never there? When you are, you make those times special. How are you gonna raise kids? There's more than one way to raise kids. Lots of different ways.

Watch out!" Fuck yes. Watch your mouth. You know the one thing that bothered me to no end when I was with Darlene, she would smoke like a chimney. She wouldn't quit. No matter how much I asked her. "Dear Daddy, Mommy says you're a deadbeat. I don't know what that means. I think she's angry at you. I think Mommy is a crackerhead because she wouldn't let me have a doggy. If I had a doggy, I would name it Daddy." So this Dot fixes Darlene's portrait. Yeah. You fucking son of a bitch! Makes her look much more like her. Better even. - Fucking psycho. - And her eyes, like they're looking right at me. Let me go! Like she's looking right into me. But she can tell that... How much love I've put into this masterpiece. You psycho! Shut your mouth! Don't you realize who you're talking to? Fucker! Fuck! That's enough! Let me go, you fucking cunt! Who the fuck are you calling a cunt? Darlene's got a mouth on her too.

It was the only one. I asked at every truck stop that I visited for years. And it's the only one I ever got. I thought that she, you, just didn't wanna have anything to do with me. Maybe Darlene just had it in for me. There were a lot more. "Dear Daddy, I thought I saw your truck today... I thought I saw your truck today when we went to see Grandma. Did you see me?" I saw you everywhere. "Dear Daddy, I saw in a movie that a woman drove her car off a cliff. I was really sad. I imagined you saving her.

Thank you for saving all the animals, Daddy. Hey, Darlene is a smart woman. In many ways the smartest woman I ever met, but I think you're smarter. I know I did wrong and I never would have done it again. I learned my lesson. She left me and I learned my lesson. And if she'da taken me back, like I asked her, I'da have made her the happiest woman - on this planet. - Do you think Darlene was an unhappy person? I think she would have been happier with me.

I'da made sure your momma was good to you, But that didn't happen. - She didn't have to leave. - Yeah, she did. She didn't have to leave. You put her in fucking hospital! I know I hurt her.

You can't blame that on me. Beat me with a hairbrush. Do you wanna see the scars? Do you want to see the scars? You can't blame it on me! She left. She didn't tell me where you were. What difference would it have made? You nearly killed her! She wouldn't shut up. She's jabbing and talking and jabbing and talking. She just wouldn't shut up! She said that wasn't the first time either. Do you think she would have been the only Dot or just the first? She didn't have to leave. God, I could have stopped her from hurting you.
