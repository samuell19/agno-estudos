MAN 4: Come on! (SCREAMING) Not tonight, Sammy. (WOMAN CRYING) Who the fuck are you? Move out. MAN: Yeah, who is this putz? Listen, ball-breakers. I don't like being disturbed when I'm trying to rest. Check him out. The local clown. MAN: So pop a pill and go back to sleep. Maybe I'll just put you guys to sleep. Got it? (SOBS) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) (CAR ENGINE SPUTTERING) (NECK CRACKING) (CARDIOGRAPH BEEPING) (GASPING) Shit. You stupid fuck! You wanna get us all killed? Dumb Polack. Don't you fuck with me, Evans, you understand? I will cut your motherfucking heart out! Calm down, Slisko. They sent us here to rid the world of the Yellow Peril. Have you forgotten? (SCOFFS) Listen, asshole, if we get outta here alive, motherfucker, I'm gonna shove that kris right up your ass! You got it? Yeah, well, you come on with it. Don't push me, man. (GROANS) (SIGHS) (WOMAN SCREAMING) No! Yes. No! Yes. No! Oh, yes, you're going to like it. No! No! It's good, you'll like it. Yeah. (SCREAMING) WOMAN: Please, help! TOM: Jesus Christ, Slisko! What's going on? You fuckers! What the fuck are you doing? Are you outta your mind? What the fuck do you think you're doing? You trying to kill her? This is my first leave and you're going to get us busted. (GRUNTS) (WOMAN SQUEALS) (WOMAN SOBBING) Ugh, I give you the fucking day off and what do you guys do? You try to fucking kill each other. Well, it wasn't me, these guys busted in and... Stand at attention when I'm talking to you. And you! Sick, sadistic bastard! Is this your idea of relaxation? Uh... I'm speaking to you. No, sir. (MOANS) (SNAPS FINGERS) (GROANS) I'm telling you you're gonna learn a whole new meaning of the word relaxation. You got that? Uh... Huh? Bastard. Yes, sir. Out of here! I'll return in one hour, don't be late. Good luck. See you soon, Bob. Okay, you guys, the radio shack is right up here ahead. Now we gotta take it without firing a shot. Slisko, you flank off to the right. Tom, you to the left. I'm going straight in. Let's do it. Shh. (GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) (MEN SPEAKING VIETNAMESE) (MEN LAUGHING) (BEEPING) (SPEAKING VIETNAMESE) (GUN FIRING) (GRUNTS) (GUN FIRING) (GROANS) (GRUNTING) (GROANS) How's a dumb kid like you get himself shot when he's about to get a nice, long leave? Leave the fucking rifle. Sorry, brother, this fucking uniform's got a curse on it. Caused too many deaths. TOM: Promise me you'll never put it on again. Promise. Come on! Let's get the fuck outta here. No, we'll stay here and wait. They'll make it out. I said, come on, come on, come on. Let's get the fuck outta here. And leave them here. You must be crazy. SLISKO: They got shot, we can't wait! It's too dangerous! PILOT: Hey, look, here they come. EVANS: Give me a hand. SLISKO: In a pig's eye. I said, get the fuck outta here! Slisko, stop! You fucking asshole. Come back here. Come back here, you fucking bastard! (GROANS) Oh, Jesus. Well, I'm happy to see you finally woke up, you've been out for almost a week. You know, I spent five years in a prison camp in Vietnam. And if I remember correctly I got shot in the chest, so I don't need you here, Dundee, to be breaking my balls, eh? (EXCLAIMS) (LAUGHS) Still the same arrogant son of a... Ah. Anyway, you're going to have to be a little more cooperative in the future. Now that you're well, we've got a job to do. Why don't you just get the hell outta here? I know all about your jobs, Dundee. So count me out! I've had enough killings. Mmm? And what else do you know how to do? Uh. Let me think about that for a minute. Mmm-hmm. You know how to sleep under bridges. Well, I'll see you later, right? Yeah, just as soon as you get dressed and come downstairs. We've got a job to do. It involves tracking an old buddy of yours. If I'm not mistaken, his name is Slisko. (DOOR CLOSING) DUNDEE: Come on, take a closer look. Now you tell me, what kind of blade would butcher a body like that? Christ. A scalloped blade with a double edge. A Malay kris. Mmm-hmm. That means the motherfucker's in New York and he's turned psychopath. Maybe, maybe not. But he sure knows a lot of tricks with that knife. This is the sixth body in 14 weeks. Huh. And the New York police? What are they doing about it? Sitting on their asses? It would seem so. We have taken the case over. Evans, I'd like you to meet Andrew Roberts. He's with the FBI. Our section has been investigating various Southeast Asian arms-trafficking organizations for about two years now. They're using recycled weapons from the Nam to supple the Cambodians, Laotians and even the Burmese guerillas. There will never be peace in Southeast Asia unless we succeed in wiping this trafficking right out at the source. We've discovered that the boss of the organization is a certain Big John. John Slisko, no less. Till now we haven't been able to nail him. Or locate his main headquarters. The FBI isn't what it used to be. However, we do know that the sadistic son of a bitch has been in New York, murdering prostitutes with a kris. Yeah, that's his signature! You are going to help us find him, Evans. Is that clear? Dundee says you have an old score to settle, hmm? I swore two things on my buddy's grave, one that I was going to kill Slisko, and two, that I'd never wear a uniform again. But a lot of time's gone by. This is the police report on the latest victim. Her name was Tracy Ross. She was a heroin addict. And she worked the Bronx. That doesn't seem like it's gonna be much help. Well, maybe this will help you. She worked for a pimp called Nick Cobra, who's also a pusher. (TIRES SCREECHING) (TIRES SCREECHING) Let's go. Come on. Hey, old fella. You know where I can find Nick Cobra? Mmm. I'm talking to you. No, we're not gonna get anything outta him. Come on. Yeah. Hey! Kill 'em, Cobra, they're cops. (GRUNTS) What the fuck do you want, nigger? Hold on, Cobra. I just need some information. Who sent you, nigger? Salvation Army. No, they didn't. You are one of those motherfuckers from drugs. And you're not welcome here. (GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) Hey, Evans, more fun then sleeping under bridges, huh? What do you say we get out of here? Let's talk to Cobra. (GROANING) You know who killed Tracy Ross, don't you? Eh? How would I know who it was who killed her? And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you. Go ask one of your skunks. (GROANING) So you do know who killed her, huh? (STAMMERING) I don't know nothing! Huh? Talk to me Cobra. COBRA: You won't get nowhere with me, man. (COBRA GRUNTS) Use this. Let's try that again. I want some answers. Huh? Okay, okay. No more, stop. There is a gym. Yeah? Downtown Athletic Club. Let me check it out. Take a look there. Tracy met a man there who was into S&M. (STAMMERING) But it paid well. (PANTING) Mr. Cobra, I thank you. And you better not be lying to me. DUNDEE: I'll report to Roberts. You go check out the gym. MAN: Pretty good. Excuse me, the office? Through there. Thanks. Who's he? Some guy looking for the office. Excuse me, I'm looking for the office? Right over there. Thank you. Excuse me, wrong room. I was looking for the owner. No, you didn't get the wrong room. I'm the owner. How do you do, I, uh... Would you mind closing the door, please? The public isn't admitted to this performance. Who are you, anyway? Are you selling something? Looking for a job? I'm looking for a friend of mine. John Slisko. Stop. Are you a cop? No. Ex-Marine. John and I spent a lot of time together in Vietnam. I just wanna find out what happened to him. Why are you looking for your friend here? I heard he joined a gym in this neighborhood. What did you say his name was? Slisko. S-L-I-S-K-O. You've drawn a blank. He's not a member of my club. Okay. Do you know a Terry Ross? Never heard of her. Who is she? She's from the Bronx. What'd you say your name was again? I didn't. It's Marion. Well, Marion. I think we're gonna be seeing each other again real soon. Mmm. I'm really disappointed in you, Charles. I really thought you were smarter than that. What do you mean? (DOOR OPENING) CHARLES: (STAMMERING) What are you talking about? You stupid motherfucker, you really think you were going to get away with this? I don't know what you're talking about. You don't know what I'm talking about? No. No, huh? No. Tell me. You didn't try to backdoor me on the Cambodian deal? Set yourself up in business? No. Fuck me out of $3 million. You didn't try to do that, huh? Try to steal my clients with my own fucking merchandise, huh? No, no. You stupid fucking asshole. I've been in this business 15 goddamn years, you understand me? And in 15 years I've made some pretty good friends. Did you really think that you were going to be able to do this and not have somebody tell me? Did you? Did you? (SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) MAN: Hey, boss. Marion just got a visit from a guy who was looking for you. (SIGHS) You know what they do to traitors, Charles? No. They take 'em out in the morning at sunrise and put 'em up against the wall and they blow their brains out. Now what do you think we should do to you? Give me a chance, please, give me a chance. I'll repay you, I promise you. You're dreaming, Charles. You've blown your last chance. So who the hell was this guy? Well, how do I know, he didn't leave his name. But he did say he was in Nam with me. Right. What else did he say? He said that you and he had been in Nam for several years, and that he'd heard that you were using a gym in this part of the city. (LAUGHS) Describe him for me. Come on, what did he look like? He was slender, muscular, dark brown hair. One of those Jesus-type beards. Does that mean anything to you? Yeah. More than you know. I want you to do a little favor for me, huh? A favor? Yeah, you can do a little favor for me, can't you? I want you to identify a corpse for me. A corpse? Listen, John, I really don't want any part of this, okay? You're already part of this, baby. Come on. You can do this for me, can't you? Huh? Haven't you been doing it all along? Huh? Yeah. You'll do it for me, wont you, baby? Yeah. Take the body and put it in my car. Then abandon it some place. You mean, your car? Yeah. And fill it up. All the way up. DUNDEE: I came to pick you up as soon as Roberts called me. What happened? A couple of hours ago, the police found a charred body in a burned-out Pontiac over on, uh, Staten Island. Guess who owns the car? Slisko. Slisko. Has the body been identified? Well, it could be him, but unfortunately there were no prints. He could have rigged it. Yeah, he could have changed the corpse to make us think it was him. You should know what that means, don't you? Somebody tipped him off. Yeah, Marion. The owner of the gym. DUNDEE: I think it's time we went over there and searched that place. It's okay, the coast is clear. The night watchman won't be back for an hour. This way. EVANS: There's the office. Come on, we haven't got much time. What time is that plane? MAN: A quarter to 10:00. You know what you gotta do tomorrow? (SIGHS) Sure. I go to the police and say that I can identify that body. Try to sound convincing. Huh, I'll go there and bawl my head off. Bastard really thinks he's smart. Let's go. Don't move, hold it! Ahh! Ahh! Get up there and find out what that was. SLISKO: And make sure you take care of it. Hold it, or I'll blow your brains out. What are you going to do, stand there all day? Take the goddamn bag, get the car and bring it around the back. Go with him. Drop the gun. Hello, Roy. Well, I see you actually made it outta there alive. (SLISKO LAUGHING) Congratulations. Now, let me guess. I'll bet you're here for revenge. (LAUGHING) Never could take a joke, could you? Too bad to spoil it for you. (GUN FIRING) (GRUNTS) Hold it. (GUN FIRING) (GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) Shit. Damn. So there is something else you know how to do, Evans. Wise ass. (GRUNTS) That bastard got away. Car was outside waiting. Well, let's get outta here. SLISKO: Shit! I don't understand it! How did this fucking Dundee get on our ass? They're not going to find anything at the gym to lead them to our bases. John, there's no way I can keep on running the gym now. You've got to take me with you. Pull the car over. MAN: Right. Pull it over. Get out of the car. No, I'm not getting out. Get out of the car. I'm not getting out, John. I said get out of the fucking car! (MOANS) I'm still your woman, aren't I? Oh, sure, baby. You're still my woman. You'll always be my woman. Now, get the fuck out of here. What are you crazy, or something? I said, get the fuck out of here. All right, I'm going, okay. (DOOR OPENING) No! (GUN FIRING) Police, let's go. (POLICE SIREN WAILING) Help! Stop! (MOANS) Hmm. Check out this new Beretta. Fresh out of Italy. He's gotta have over a million dollars worth of stuff here. And this just represents the minimal part of his operation, the bulk of which is in Southeast Asia. If we only knew where. I think I know somebody who knows. Ah, that redhead, what's her name? Marion. Marion. (LAUGHING) And she also happens to be Slisko's woman. Well, I'm glad to see you're thinking on your feet. Let's get out of here. You know it. Okay. (MOANING) Take it easy, Marion. This place fixed me up just fine. I'll take it easy when I don't see you anymore. When you're around there's just trouble. (GROANS) Your problem is with Slisko. Now, you can rid yourself of him if you want to. By just telling us where his plane was headed. Where he was going. And what's in it for me? Well, you don't owe him anything. I mean, he would have killed you without a second thought. Now you can help us and we'll help you. It's a deal. Where's the plane headed? He was headed towards Bangkok. Thailand is the center of the arms trade. Are you sure it's Bangkok, Dundee? Positive. Slisko's main operation is in the area, and I think it's worth a try. You gotta remember that, uh, Thailand is the center of south... All the Southeast Asian illegal trafficking. All right. The trip is on. You and I will leave today, Dundee. We'll travel in a military aircraft that will sit us down in one of our out-of-the-way bases. We can't take any chances. Slisko is bound to be well informed. That's right, listen, I'm going to need a couple of days to get a unit together. In the interim, you find out the exact location, and we'll go in and destroy it. And my role in all this? Mmm. Your role in all this? You'll be the bait. Now, you stop by the office and pick up a ticket later on this afternoon. There'll be some expense money in it as well. Uh, be at the Bangkok Peninsular Hotel within five days and I'll contact you there. WOMAN ON PA: Thai Airlines announces the arrival of flight 203 from New York. Ongoing passengers are requested to contact the information booth for connecting flights. Bus and taxi services are available to downtown Bangkok. Hey, taxi. Ah, thank you. Thank you. (SIGHS) (PHONE BEEPS) Hello. You finally arrived. Right. Are you familiar with Bangkok? I used to come here on leave during the war. Of course I'm familiar with Bangkok. I see. Listen to me carefully, Evans. I'm sure your arrival has not gone unnoticed, so try and look like a real tourist. Do all the major sights, and then please make your way to the Palamah market. A friend of ours is waiting there, and he has something very interesting to show you. Okay. Bye. Soft drink? Beer? Soft drink. Oh, thank you. Ah, the market? Palamah. EVANS: That's right. Is it far? No, it's near. Just ahead. Lots of nice brothels, you like? You see. Yeah, sure, only not right now. I gotta work. Ah! You Americans are serious. I let you off right here, okay? This is Palamah market. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) They're waiting for you. Across the street in red house. Are they? Uh-huh. It's good? Not bad. Goodbye. So long. Hold it! Ah. Where's Dundee? We were right, Evans. That bastard is in Bangkok. That's Slisko's work all right. No doubt about it. Do you think they're on to you? It's possible. You know when I was checking out those temples earlier today, I had a feeling somebody was following me. I hope it isn't just a feeling. That way, you don't have to go on fishing. Oh, that's a relief. Now what? Well you remember that gorgeous Eurasian girl... Pearl Chang Lee? Yeah. The one who was in Saigon. Ah. Oh, she's working for us here. Small world. Mmm, I've already contacted her. She's got a plant inside Slisko's operation. That'll be helpful. You're to meet her tonight at the Mandarin Restaurant. Ah, Chinese food. Please. (LAUGHS) What we do for love, huh? No, no, no. SLISKO: Take it or leave it, Kolo. Now, Slisko, wait a minute. You can't do this! Hold on. You're shaving any profit down to the bone. You already took 50% off my cut on the last job. I'm doing this for your own good, Kolo. You gotta look at this as your retirement fund. If I were to give you that money, what would you do with it? You'd just spend it on cocaine and gambling, and little boys in Bangkok. You're getting soft, Kolo. And business is suffering for it. I have done a good job for you, Slisko. And don't forget, I introduced you into the Southeast Asia arms-trade network! I haven't forgotten. If I had, you'd already be dead. Now get outta here. And go and take care of business. Before I forget what a good friend you are. I kept on Evans' trail everywhere he went. Then I lost him in the market. Shit! I'm sorry, boss. It's imperative that I know every goddamn move they make. Shit. And Kolo. Yeah. Keep an eye on him. I don't trust him anymore. He gave up too goddamn easily. I'll do it, boss. Sorry, sir, we are fully booked. I'm with her. Oh, in that case come right in. I'll send a waiter over immediately. Great honor. Fine. You haven't changed at all, you know that? If anything you're even more beautiful than before. I bet you've never said that to a girl before, have you? You remember when we met in that bar in Saigon? Yes, you asked me how many dollars I wanted to go to bed with you. How were you to know I was working for the police? (LAUGHS) Yeah, and I thought you were going to arrest me. You know, it's going to be great working together, Evans. So, uh, you got a man planted in Slisko's operation. His name is Kolo. So far, I learned Slisko operates from two camps. One located in the former refugee camp. Just outside Bangkok. The other near the Cambodian border, but I really don't know precisely where. Well, we gotta find out where it is, if we wanna nail Slisko. You can meet with Kolo tomorrow. He'll give you more information. Where do you have your man planted? An import-export company that we know is involved in the arms trafficking. He'll be waiting for you in Kwai Park, in a hut near the refugee camp. Here's a map of the location. You better destroy it as soon as you've memorized it. Let's get out of here. How about a night club? I have got a better idea. Do we want to go to my place? Always thinking ahead. Come on. If you only knew how much I wanted you that first night in Saigon. I wanted you as badly. Why didn't we ever get it together before now? You did not understand anything then because you were too busy thinking of the war. (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) Hey, the other side. Over there. Kwai Park. (WOMEN LAUGHING) I'm looking for Kolo. Pearl sent me. Looking for Kolo? He's dying to see you. (GUN FIRING) But he couldn't wait for you. (GUN CLICKS) You know, Evans, you always were a pain in the ass. But you ain't shit for brains. You just never were too bright, that's all. Do it. This is your big chance, Slisko. Don't blow it. (LAUGHS) You flatter yourself, Evans. You're not that important to me. I want Dundee. And you're gonna tell me where he is, aren't you? Huh? Fuck you, Slisko. Eh? Eh? (LAUGHING) Up your ass, pal. Yeah, eh? Shove it. Tough guy. Let's see how tough you are, tough guy. You wanna lose this one here? Eh? You tough now, eh, tough guy? You wanna show me how tough you are? Which one you want me to take out? This one, huh? I'll take this one out for you? Or how about this one? Hey, boss. I'll give you a choice, They're all ready to take off. They're waiting for you. which one you want? You get a reprieve this time, I got more important things to take care of. Listen, I want you to save him for me. And don't break him up too bad. Mmm-hmm. Taylor. (GRUNTS) How come there's nobody guarding the depot? I sent the boys into Bangkok for supplies. Don't worry, boss, no one's gonna attack it. Not bad. Not bad. Sir. Yeah? I got a call from that agent, Pearl Chang Lee. Something happened. Evans is in danger. I can't let him outta my sight for a minute. (SCOFFS) He's always had the worst of timing. Pearl's afraid they're holding him prisoner near, uh, the refugee camp. Let's go. Hey! Sir, you got other things to do now, you don't need me. (SCOFFS) Waste not, want not, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Do you think the boss is going to get back here by tonight? If the Cambodians are on time, yeah. It's 200 miles from Lao Kampur to here. He can do that in four hours. (WHISPERING) Lao Kampur. (GRUNTS) Not bad, Roy. Not bad yourself, Pearl. How'd you know I was here? Kolo sent a message. They're arriving in the jeep. How do we get out? Through the refugee camp. There is no one guarding it. So we can take our pick of weapons at their depot. Are you sure? I came through that way. I thought they might have taken you there. Okay. Let's go. This baby's not going to help us it's out of ammo. Frank, what happened to Evans? He escaped. They came and got him out. And then they killed Hannibal and Vargas. How many were there? I don't know. Shit. They must've holed up in the refugee camp. Otherwise, we would have run into them. Let's get the bastards. Call the others on the walkie-talkie and tell them to meet us there. Right. Wait a minute. Keep a lookout from over there. I'm going to check out the huts. Okay? Be careful. All right. PEARL: They're coming down the road. Now, listen up. I don't want them to realize that there's only two of us in here. So you take that window and cover that door, you got it? MAN: Okay, men, spread out and surround 'em. You can hold this. It's not too heavy. Mmm-hmm. MAN: You men cover the rear! Keep under cover! It might be a trap. Well, you're ready. They're here. (MEN YELLING) (GUN FIRING) They're coming around the back, Pearl. Ahh. Ahh. (GUN FIRING) (HELICOPTER APPROACHING) (GRUNTS) Ahh. (BOTH GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) Come here. Inside. (GRUNTING) Welcome to paradise. Well, I'm just glad I was able to get here at all. I've never been happier to see you. Huh. Well, looks like I showed up just in time. You ever heard of Lao Kampur? Mmm-hmm. Situated on a river near the Cambodian border, why? That's where Slisko is. And if we're lucky we can grab him. Very good. Let's go. Uh, hang on, I gotta question for you. Where's Pearl? (LAUGHS) Oh, shit. Look who's here. Oh, Roberts. I told him he better back me up. DUNDEE: Listen carefully. This has got to go like clockwork, or all our asses are going to be in a sling. Here's the area we have to secure. Lao Kampur is right here along the river. Surprise is of the essence. You got that? Naturally. Slisko knows I've escaped by now. He's going to be on the alert. Probably. But he doesn't know that we have the exact location of his headquarters. Now, we've got five men, plus myself. We've got the arms, we come out of the helicopter and... No, no, wait a minute. If you come down here, he's gonna have all the fucking time in the world to get organized and set a trap! Well, that's your problem. That's exactly why I brought you here. (SIGHS) Why is it that I always get the dirty end of the stick? (SPEAKING FRENCH) Very well, Dundee. Prepare the attack. Go ahead. So we're going to screw that damn psychopath once and for all, eh? Ah, you're gonna get promoted for it, right? You got something to tell me? No, everything is okay. The Cambodians are taking delivery tonight. Good. SLISKO: All right, listen to me. As soon as the Cambodians have paid up, I'm taking the seaplane to Singapore. I want you to dismantle the base and pay off the men. What's the hurry? Dundee is on our ass. Evans has escaped and they've destroyed the depot. Or don't you remember? How long do you think it'll take 'em to find us? Did you hear a chopper? No, I didn't hear nothing. (GRUNTING) (SPEAKING THAI) (HELICOPTER APPROACHING) It's that fucking Dundee! I told you we had problems. He's not as smart as he thinks he is. Our men will shoot them down like pigeons. Hold it, hold it. I know this move! It's the same goddamn thing Dundee did in Nam. Get to the tanks, to the fuel tanks! Hurry up! Shit! Ahh. (GUN FIRING) Ahh! (ENGINE SPUTTERING) Ahh! Ahh! (GUN FIRING) (GRUNTS) Come on. Come on! Get up! Come on, Slisko. Come on, get up. (GROANS) (GUN FIRING) Evans! (BREATHING HEAVILY) (TWIG SNAPPING) Hold it right there, Major. Looks like we're back together in the bush again, huh? Oh, yes, we are. But we're on different sides this time, Slisko. We don't have to be, Major. We don't have to be? We're just here doing the same shit that I was doing here with you 15 goddamn years ago. You and Oliver North don't run that bullshit on me! You butchered those girls. With your specialty, that damn knife of yours. What the fuck are you talking about? I'm talking about those women you butchered with your special knife. I ain't butchered nobody. Heh. Slisko, we got the evidence. That damn knife you so expertly know how to use. That's what I'm talking about! No, I don't know what you're talking about! What are you fucking nuts? What do you think? I got nothing better to do than go cut people up? There's big money in this shit, Major! You don't know what I'm talking about, do you? This may be a fucking setup. It may be any other fucking thing that you want to do, but I want to tell you something, I ain't killed no goddamn body with no fucking kris. You don't know what I'm talking about. Yeah, right. I don't know. I don't fucking know. You're right, Major. I don't know. Then who the hell... Slisko! Wait! Wait! (WOMAN CRYING) This is it. My moment of madness. It's no use crying. Wasting your time. Huh? I decided to stop after that Slisko bastard is killed. He was my alibi. But then you presented yourself at my office. You excited me, saying you'd been Slisko's woman. Bastard! The only one who had access to Slisko's file. The only one who knew he'd been questioned for torturing that Vietnamese prostitute with that knife. You're finished, Mr. Roberts. Another brilliant career bites the dust. Ahh! (SCREAMS) (GUN FIRING REPEATEDLY) (GASPING) (GRUNTING) Good job, Marion. You really had him eating out of your hand. Fuck off, will you? If I'd known how dangerous these games were gonna be I'd never have taken part in them. Well, I think you've earned your freedom. But of course, I've never seen you before, I don't know who you are and you've never seen me, right? Hmm. Right. Well, would you like a little souvenir? Leave it. Come on.
