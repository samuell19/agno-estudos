Don't start, Linda. - But you've been smoking too much, Bucky. What about your uncle, what if he found out about this? Did he put you all the way through school so you could end up like this? What about his dreams, your dreams? You're gonna be in the pros. I can take care of myself! Look, I know what I'm doing. - From the North to the South, from coast to coast!

He was smoking too much of it. - Linda, I want you to call an ambulance and when they get here I want you to tell them what he has had! You understand?! - Hey, nothing but a little confusion folks, everything will be all right, in the meantime why don't you all sit back, relax, and go ahead on and party, all right? Party party! Why don't you folks on out there party for me, let's go and get down! Get that dancing, get real with it. Go on and funk with it a little while. - Williams drives down the court. He fakes two cats out! He lays it in for two! Hey, what the fuck y'all looking at? Shit. Zero! Zero! Oh God, ah! BUCky! Get a hold of yourself. - You got any baking soda, man? Get some baking soda. - I don't care, long as he don't touch me man. Ahh! It's too ugly! - You better get your shit together brother. - You know karate or something? - Bucky, get a hold of yourself. - Get done with it, man. Get him out! No, r10, no, no! No, God, no! BUCky! No, man, no no! Come down from there! All right, come on fellas. No, no! No! - Bucky, what has you done to yourself? No need to talk to him now, he's blacked out. - Where are you taking him, I'm his uncle. I'm taking him to a PCP unit in Marygrove, a little shop I'm running out there. Very well, I'll follow you. - No need to come down tonight, he won't be coherent for a couple of days. Doctor, what has he had? Tell you what, you come down tomorrow and I'll give you a tour of the place, then you'll get a chance to see Bucky and about 20 others like him wacked out on angel dust. Haven't you heard, Godfather? Our children are dying. BUCky! Let's go home. What made him act like that? Phenylcyclohexylpiperidine. Pheny-what? - It's a new drug with many names. White, PCP, angel dust. It's the newest psychedelic chemical of the 70s for young kids. It's really wacking them out of their minds, a lot of them are dying even. Come on, I'll show you some more, Godfather. Just get her out of here! - Now this kid is totally withdrawn from reality. He thinks he's a unborn caterpillar. He claims it's safer than being human. - How long has he been here, doctor? - He's been here about a year now. Sit down, Mr. Godfather. What's her problem? - That's Tamica, I'm sure you read about her. She's a big dope dealer from back east, she blacked out one day. She invited her family over for dinner one day and served a four month old baby on a silver platter with all the trimmings. She had roasted the child in an oven. " How? And Why? Well she claimed her ham was crying and she didn't want the ham crying and messing up her party. She was totally out of it. - Where's this stuff coming from, doctor? The clandestine laboratories throughout the community. The ingredients are easy to come by and very simple to make. In fact, an eighth grade chemistry student could just knock off batches of it. Angel dust. And I thought I was on top of everything. And in my family? That's getting too damn close. Bucky, Bucky, Bucky! The doctor said you were gonna be all right. What? What about my arm, man? - Bucky, what are you talking about? - How can I play when I ain't got no... I can still play, right? Of course you can play, Bucky. You know you're the best. Oh I thought I was... - Don't worry about it, Bucky. It's gonna be all right. Uncle Tuck, did you see it? Did you see what happened to my arm man?! Bucky, Bucky! Bucky, hold onto yourself, hold onto yourself! I think we've gotta leave. - Bucky, just like the doctor said, you have always been the best. I want you to take care of yourself. Uncle Tuck, I'll be okay. Don't worry. I'll be okay. I'll see you tomorrow. I'll be okay. Mister mister, don't tell me nothing can be done for my baby. Please don't tell me nothing she'll never be the same again, please. - Mrs. Edwards, your granddaughter's in very serious condition right now. She just sits there. She don't even know me! She don't even move. She's just 15 years old. - We've tried everything, nothing seems to work, so there's only one last resort that I have. And what is that doctor? ECT. What's ECT? - Electric shock treatment, Mrs. Edwards. Oh Lord no! Lord no! Oh no. - Hopefully after several of these treatments she'll return back to her normal self and then we'll be able to work with her better. - No, ain't nobody shocking my baby. You had her here a month and with all your medicine, you haven't been able to do nothing for her yet? - Mrs. Edwards, PCP is a new drug. We don't understand it either, we're all trying to find ways to deal with it. No. There's only one other way, and that's by faith. - You don't understand, Mrs. Edwards. We're dealing with a drug that's beyond modern medicine. That's beyond all of us. But I believe. Yes I believe, and that's what's important. Please, let us pray for my baby. - Jeniko, take them out and let them pray, will you? Let them pray. Thank you. Want this guy? Yeah, that one. - Well there Tucker, good to see you! Hey, nightclub business going south, so you come back to join us, right? - Are you kidding, who's gonna watch all those bouncing tits and asses while the Disco Godfather's away fighting crime? I will! I Will! Please let me, Godfather! Knock off the bullshit fellas, where's the lieutenant? Oh he's around someplace. Say look, you really are coming back to join us right? Sorta. I wanna put my reserve statuses back to work so I can see if I can come up with something on this angel dust phenomenon. - Uh oh, they made the Godfather angry. - Hey Lieutenant, look who's here? - Oh Williams, how you've been? Glad to see you again. Hello, Frank. I don't have much time, is there someplace we can talk? - You can talk in front of these guys. This is my best team to date since you left. What's on your mind? This angel dust thing. Oh that. - Say, look what I finally caught a whiff. He's all yours. Frank, it's killing our kids. Bucky's in the hospital and his head is all screwed up now. - Bucky, oh no, he's too smart for that. It's kid stuff. He's got a whole career ahead of him. That's what bugs me. There's something wrong about the whole mess. I'm gonna do some investigating on my own, but I'm gonna need your support in case anything goes down. Look out! When Tucker says he's gonna get to the bottom of it, he means just that. We can all take a lesson from him. - Just wanted to square things with you, Frank. So I knew I'd have a clear sailing. This is a small town and you know it wouldn't take long to put two and two together, can you dig? - Just stick to the rules Tucker, huh? Act as a reserve. Will you do that for me? I'll keep in touch. See you later. - There's only three things you can do to that man to really get him uptight. One of them is to mess with his family. He's gonna turn over every stone in this city until he finds a main man. When he does, all hell is gonna break loose. - As you can see, to be a member of the Disco Squad at The Godfather you have to get funky and get down. It's just an honor to dance on the platform here. - So they say you're the best huh? Yeah, that's right. - I guess you must have audition all the time. - Well we have audition once a week. Oh there's my boss, Tucker! Tuck, this is your 10 o'clock appointment. Tucker Williams, Ellen Davis, Sun News. Pleased to meet you. We waited about an hour, then decided to go ahead and do the interview with Noel. She's been very informative. This is quite a place you've got here, Mr. Williams. It'll really enhance my article on the disco dance craze, you know, why it's happening. Is there anything you'd like to add? You must excuse me Miss Davis, but when I think about newspaper reporters, I think about little twerps that are smoking cigars in their beat down hats, but in your case I'm gonna give you the full coverage. - My cigar smoke might've annoyed you. - In your case, I think I can hack it. Miss Davis has to go Tuck, can you add anything else to the interview? Yes. Miss Davis, I want you to put something in your article about this angel dust craze. The mess that's going around that is destroying our young people. 'Cause I'm personally gonna join the citizens and come down on the suckers that's producing this shit. Can I quote you on that? You can bet your last dollar. This is great, I've gotta go, but I'm gonna get this on the front page. It's been a pleasure meeting you, Disco Godfather, I've heard so much about you. Take care. Some lady, huh? She's gonna be an asset to us. She's okay, how's Bucky? He's all right. Noel, after the club opens up, I want you to ask questions and do a little snooping around on your own, see what you can find out. Oh that's no problem here. - In the meantime I'm gonna see if I can make some contact with my snitch friends. Maybe I can find out something. If you need me, I'll be in the office. - You can't use the phone in there Tuck, the telephone company's working on it. Did you call them? No, I thought you did. Just finishing, Mister. What's the problem, man? No problem, but just some cross wires, it's okay now. Let me check the line. Talk! Who sent you?! Talk! You're gonna break it! Talk! Who sent you?! Look, they sent us to bug the phone, that's all I know, I swear! Names, names! I want names, you stupid son of a bitch! Oh my God, Tuck! Are you all right? Baby, are you all right? I'm all right. Word sure gets around fast. - I mean who were they, what did they want? - They're watching my every move. Somebody knows I'm out to get 'em. Question is who. - Mr. Stinger, Mr. Stinger! Mr. Stinger, you've been called the business man with the Midas touch. Tell me, what makes you think your luck will hold with the new basketball team? - Well you've already answered that, remember? I've got the touch of gold. I can't miss. I'll show the NBA a thing or two. - And how do you plan to do that? By picking up the rejects, the guys who didn't make pro. Now you take a guy whose played ball most of his life. He's gonna be hungry. If he can't make the NBA he's gonna be mad and hungry. With my new team, the objective is to pick up those guys. Ican1lose. What will you call your team? The Stingrays of course. Got any other choices you care to share with us? Not at this point. Don't want anybody from the pros jumping all over my plans. You know how those buzzards are. - There's a phone call for you, Mr. Stinger. Tell them to call back later. I'm having a press conference. This is important, boss. I'll be back shortly. Wait a minute- I'll be right back, Doomsday, open up that bar, let's get everyone a drink. - Ladies and gentlemen, this way please! Hello? Who? Yes, I thought I told you not to call here. - Hey, just called to let you know the bug on Tucker's phone didn't work. He caught them both. What? Did they talk? - I don't know, they said they didn't, but you never can tell. - Take care of them so that they don't ever. I think you should do the same thing to Tucker. You don't know this guy like I do. Eventually he's gonna close in and you got a lot at stake here. So do I. - So what are you talking about it for? Do it. It would be my pleasure. What you got? 15,000. How much you got? Six gallons. - How long before you have this shipment ready? - The pick up is at nine o'clock tonight. A thousand gallons, we'll be ready. Good. What about for our local people? - We bagged up 1,500 ounces for our locals and dipped over 10,000 cigarettes. High quality stuff. It should go fast. - I want it all delivered by tomorrow. Production is closed down until all this stuff is delivered and sold. Do you understand? Yes sir. Good. It's called staying ahead of the game. Listen, I've gotta go set up, and sir, you have exactly two minutes until showtime! Vicky, see me after you finish up, we've got work to do. Where else am I going? Here's your drink, Tucker. And I see your doctor friend is here. He's not so bad either. Thanks, Vicky. Paul, it's showtime and we gonna knock 'em dead! - Welcome to the Disco Blueberry Hill. Are you ready for the show? It is now showtime, so at this time ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the floor the Disco Skate Dancers! Give 'em a great round of applause. - Are you ready to start tonight? Right now at this time ladies and gentlemen I'd like to bring to the floor a young man that needs no introduction at all. Right now, none other than, Disco Godfather! Give him a big round of applause! And now, ladies and gentlemen, let's meet and greet "The Savior" Action Jackson! Let's hear it one more time for "The Savior" Jackson Dancers! Yes, our first show tonight sure did went great didn't it, oh baby, but listen, tomorrow night our first show will take place in The Imperial Room. Yes, we have two big rooms that you can disco in seven nights a week! With your Godfather rapping too. All right now there, brothers and sisters, one more time, put your weight on it, put your weight on it, put your weight on it, put your weight on it! - So you see, Mr. Disco, our causes both have the same goal, if we can join forces then the fight against angel dust would definitely be strengthened. - That's a good point, young ladies, but I think I'll have to deal with it more tomorrow. I do like your organization. If you could just give us some commitment now we'll certainly preserve our- - Noel, these young ladies are from- - I know, don't tell me, let me guess. These ladies are Angels Against Dust. So did you tell them you'd give them your full support? If not girls, we're with you 100 percent. As a matter of fact I have a spot right outside and we'll talk about it after the show. - We'll be waiting. - We'll be waiting. - Okay, let me take this from the top. - After the doctor finishes his speech I want you and the girls to go to the door, take the names of all the people who would like to go on the crusade against angel dust. We are gonna attack the wack. # Now we believe, we won't doubt # Yes, we believe, trust Him now # I believe the sun will shine As you know... Sister Edwards, the Lord said, chapter 19 and 16 of Acts, about the evil spirits. We know that this child can be healed. We're going to pray for her. Pray that God will bless and heal and deliver her. We believe He's a deliverer! _ 0h yes! Don't you believe? Don't you believe?! - Praise the Lord, you're gonna be all right, baby. Let's pray for her right now. Dear God, release this demon. This evil and most vengeful demon! The demon of death! Demon of destruction! Demon of evilness! Bring him out right now! - Thank you, Councilman Watson. I would like to remind everybody again, if you know any known drug dealers, any PCP dealers, please call us at 382-9749, it will be held strictly confidential. We wanna wack the attack against angel dust! Here we have today with us, with us we have today Michelle Stuart who has come in from San Francisco to tell us about a traumatic experience that she had there, Michelle. - Before I introduce Doctor Fred to you, I would just like to say a word about the terrible drug called angel dust. It is by far the most dangerous stuff that one could get into. Believe me, I speak from experience. If it hadn't been for Dr. Fred here who caught me before it was too late, I couldn't be here to tell you what hell can go through. So please leave it alone, if you haven't start, don't. - Thank you so much, Michelle Stuart, for her very personal experience with angel dust. How many of you have had the experience with angel dust? The same as Michelle? Thank you so much for coming out and participating in this crusade against angel dust. I also would like to introduce Ellen Davis of the Sun News. Also we have with us the Angels Against Dust over at the table who will be along with Doctor Fred Mathis to answer any questions that you may have against angel dust. Okay, we are very fortunate today to have Doctor Fred Mathis with us who will tell you where you can go to solicit help and what can be done for cases of wack attack. A wack attack! Okay, Doctor Fred Mathis everybody. Thank you very much! A very pleasant good evening. You've heard it from somebody that's been there, so it's about time that we put our heads together and fight a thing that might save the lives of thousands and thousands of young people. This angel dust that goes under many different names, PCP, angel dust, White, alias angel death. It's not even a medicine, ladies and gentlemen, but a psychedelic chemical that's designed to destroy the minds of our youth. So this afternoon I want you to join in with me and fight! Catch this bull by the horn and let's wrestle it to the ground! And get rid of this angel dust! So are you with me? Attack on the wank attach! Thank you. - Attack the wank, attack the wank, attack the wack, attack the wack, attack the wack, attack the wack! - Expense is tremendous, I know it's gonna work. - The mayor and the city officials say we've got their full support. - I mean this is unbelievable, can you believe this? Can you believe what happens when we stick together? This is unreal. Come in. It's a good thing we decided to get rid of Tucker. You see this? I tell you he's got full front page even and he's just starting. Let me see that. So he thinks I'm an asshole, does he? Well let's just see who the real ass is, Mr. Tucker. Take that hit off of him. I'm curious to know just how smart he thinks he is. - That hit's been contracted, you know I can't call it back. Then hit the hitmen! I want him alive. Stinger, I think- - You don't make 75 grand a year to think, mister. Don't you let them harm a hair on his head. You understand? - Okay, okay, but don't say I didn't warn you. - Yes, I'm glad to see your face in the place. I want you to put a little slide in your glide! And some soul in your sole and some dip in your hip! And this big fat girl right there, some strut in yo butt! Yes, I rap and I tap and I talk a whole lot of shit! Fellas I'll have the girls out there wanting to dip for a little bit. All right, all right, all right! All right, get down, get down with the beat! If you need a little loving you can call on me. It's the Godfather talking to you! I took today and brought back yesterday! I'm the one that killed Monday. Called up Thursday to tell Friday not to worry Saturday or Sunday. I want you right back here tomorrow and groove with me, all right everybody let's get together and put your weight on it! Put your weight on it, put your weight on it, put your weight on it! This is the place to party! And I'm coming on strong! If you don't wanna boogie, take your ass on home! I'm the Godfather and my name is Tucker! Everybody knows that I'm a bad mother... Badge 143. - Well Tucker, I see you didn't waste any time. Of course it was self defense. Those good people back there were your witnesses, right? Of course not. It was an intercept team. Somebody changed their mind about me. Thought I wasn't such a wise ass after all. But why those police uniforms? They could've come in anything, they could've even come naked. And badge number 143. It keeps ringing and ringing and ringing in my head. Why? Why 143? - You Know, you ass is on the line, Tucker. You know that? So what else is new? So stay out of it. You've got a career going, a solid business. What more could you ask for? Guys dream about what you're getting. I don't get you. I don't get me either. But Lieutenant, you know blood is thicker than water and when I saw my nephew Bucky in the condition he was in, I had to do something about the wack. ' Why. man? How could I do this to myself? Don't worry, Buck. You'll get another crack at it. There's always next season. Can't you understand? I let my uncle down, myself. A lot of people that depended on me. How could I miss a playoff? - Just a learning process. You gotta remember that you wasn't in shape to do anything let alone play ball. Fucking Richard. I'll kill him. Always telling me come on Bucky, smoke some. Ain't gonna hurt nothing. You'll be able to float with the ball. Nobody will be able to stop you. I told him no, he wouldn't leave me alone! - You know what you was getting into. - So I smoked some just to shut him up. He wouldn't get off my back, he just kept pushing me on and on! - Look, you'll be leaving here in a couple of clays. Now why don't you just brush it off as experience, man. So it'll be better for you next time. It ain't about next time! I'm ready now. You get you some sleep. You need a lot of rest. I'll see you tomorrow. Hey doctor. Yeah, Bucky? Thanks. Thanks for everything. You're right, it was my own fault. Goodnight, pal. Mrs. Edwards, any luck yet? - Not yet, doctor, but we'll keep trying. - Why don't you just leave it alone? Just leave it alone, there's nothing happening, she's still the same. No, we'll be back tomorrow. She's gotta get better, she's gonna get better! She gotta get all right! - Come on Miss Edwards, let's go home. Thank you doctor! Where are you, Mister?! Are you with us or just in our minds?! You lost jacks, rats! I bet you a quarter you can't pick them all up at one time. Get lost, man! A quarter? Give me five dollars and I'll show you boys that. - I think she's challenging you, Tuck. - Honey, I'm gonna give you five dollars and I want you to give your sister some bubblegum. Ain't. - Kids is a lot of fun, ain't they man? Tucker Williams, come on in! And your friend! - Bob, you got a lot of improvements here, nice school, nice school. - Yeah, this is where our children get to worrying. - You know, I believe you know more about our ancestors than anybody. The way you talk about it, I believe you knew them all. - Tucker, you don't come and see me like you used to. I got the club now. I'm real busy. You've been taking care of yourself? I've been fine, just fine. - Paul, old Bob's got a dog around here, I believe it's a year older than him. Where she at? I know she's under here, Sheila! Sheila! I know you under there, come out Sheila! - No need in calling Sheila, Tuck. She left me a few months back. Yeah, that old bitch finally left me. I miss her too. Yes sir. I'm sorry. I'm real sorry, Bob. You know I grew up with that 0l' dog. Yup, me too. Well what's on your mind, Tucker? You look all worked up about something. Is an old man's eyes telling the truth? - Bob, you know you something else. - After awhile you just know things, that's all. Bad things happening, Bob. Things that could even knock out the whole next generation. - A lot of things in life can do that. - We're talking about something in particular, old man. Angel dust, have you heard of that? I can't say I have, young man. What is it? - Something people smoke, makes them act strange. Oh that. You mean White, that stuff that made Earlenes boy think he could stop that truck awhile back. That's it. Have you heard of anything like that? I can tell you all about it. Sit down awhile there. You know... See who that is. Tyrone! Now you've got two of my men, so you have me to deal with, or you get out! Hold it! No use wasting two good men. Tuck! How you get off coming here and busting up my Pam'? You ain't in the game no more! And I owe you nothing man, you understand, nothing! Don't get excited, Sweetmeat. It's just a friendly visit. Paul! Lookie here, all the way from the Big Apple. - You ain't got no beef with me, Tucker. Besides, I'm clean. Just visiting, that's all. And look. Lacy. It too cold for you in Detroit? - Yeah, and there's a lot of heat too. - And all of the ladies, here's Salem. Here's Sally, and Mary, and Betty, one of the nation's most notorious shoplifters. - You don't know what the hell you talking about. Bitch, you know I know you! What's bugging you man? - Angel dust, that's what's bugging me. See if you players can ball that. Angel dust? Ha, that's kids stuff. I'm an instrument of the oldest profession there is, and in my business nobody go around making zombies out of kids on the streets. - I lost one of my best ladies because of the wack! - Sweetmeat, I don't believe that shit. 'Cause anywhere there's a dollar concern, you rhinestone studded punks is out to get it and I know that! It's not my thing man. But since you on the wack, any information I get I'll make sure I'll turn it on to you. Paul, let's go. I would like a one on one. One on one? Oh that one on one.

You know, Betty! - I don't know no Betty, what the hell you want? - Open the door, I got some money for her! All right freeze! Anybody move gets his afro blown off! It's a good game, gentlemen. Why don't you come in and join us? Bullshit, I can smell it! Search the place! - Put your hands behind your head. Turn around and face the wall. Don't move. I'll blow your head off, asshole. Nice riding with you, Tucker. Just like old times, huh? Just like old times, Killroy. See you around. Take care, brother. Yeah. Shit! - Tucker, what's the matter, darling? Is it that angel dust scene's got you all keyed up again? - Oh it keeps pounding, pounding, pounding in my brain! Shit! - If you have a problem, let me share with you. Come here, let me relax you. Not a bad idea. Oh don't go! Don't g0! - I'll be right back baby, let me see who this is at the door first. Ah! No no no! Let me through! - Tucker, what the fuck? - He slit his throat in his sleep. Didn't have a chance. Frank, what is this coming to? I've known this old man ever since I was a little boy, he ain't never done nothing to nobody! Always tried to help people! And he had to go out like this. Come on, gentlemen. Frank, there's something about this whole thing that's bugging me. Like the dope bust the other day. I know for a fact that they were turning out a thousand shamans a day and when we get there there is nothing. - Nobody knew about the bust except us and the squad. I can't take your hunch that it's a leak in the department. - Yeah, but how else could they know? Lieutenant, I know it may sound grim, but it's got to be! - Well let's not start anything until you have proof. If it is a leak, let's plug it all up at once. - Well Kimball, look like we got you for good this time. I'm gonna personally see that you are locked up and the key is thrown away forever! You decrepit 0l' stupid son of a bitch! - I'll be back on the streets tomorrow. You can't stop me, Tucker. We've been going through this for years. - Put him over there on the couch, I'll deal with him after awhile. Booking this one for sales and being under the influence. Sold us shaman, high quality. I know this kid. He's always down at my disco joint. Richard? Richard! Look like you in for a lot of trouble son, you wanna talk about it? Talk about what? I didn't do nothing. Aw bullshit, let's book him. Who you selling the wack for? How's Bucky, Tuck? Is he all right? - He's all right, it's not your fault. But it is! You understand? I did it for the money. - Richard, you're not making sense! It's the shaman! He's wacked out of his head! Let him sleep it off. Oh I wanna talk to him before. What did you do to Bucky? He's the best player alive. Nobody can stop him. When he drive down that court, it was all over. Slam dunk! Stinger wanted him. Just had to have him! Stinger? - Successful businessman in town. Just purchased a new basketball team. - Well what has Stinger got to do with Bucky? Richard! Talk to me! Nobody can stop him. Put it in! Beautiful, Bucky. Nobody, nobody but me! His best friend! He gave me five bills to get Bucky. I did it! Get him out of my sight! Get him out of my sight! I'm sorry, Bucky! Get this punk out of my face! Get him out of my face! Stinger Ray. I can't believe it. Stinger's a big man in town. That kid was just probably wacked out. Now we don't wanna cause any unnecessary problems. Tucker? Number 143. That's all a beat cop is ever supposed to be. Say Lieutenant- - Wait for me in the car, will you please? What the hell are you talking about? - The two hitmen with badge number 143. I know that number, I swear it. These are my right hand men. I just don't believe that. - There's only one way we can find out, Frank. It's to set him up. You're on. Yeah? Did I wake you? It's okay, what's up? - That angel dust factory on 43rd. We're gonna hit it tonight. I need all the backup I can get. - I thought that was tomorrow night. This is my night off. Sorry about that. We'll give you double time for tonight and tomorrow you can take the day off and sleep it off. Meet me there in about an hour. Shit, yeah okay. What's the matter, dear? Nothing, go back to sleep. Yeah, this is Killroy. Clean up quick, my friends will be there in an hour. What the hell is this, Lieutenant, I thought you needed me. Hello, Tucker. Killroy. Why. Gill? Give me your gun and shield now. Don't try to explain. - You can explain a few things to me, ol' 143. Know what I mean? Oh my God. Yeah. Dead? Wait, did he talk? Well who knows? Well you better find out fast. Call me back. Doomsday, bring the car around to the front, we're going to the warehouse. Move! Right away, boss. Yeah. Cowboy? Stinger. Go all the way on Tucker today. No more fucking around with him. Look, I know what I said yesterday, this is today! He's had it. I can't get the search warrant until tomorrow at noon. What's gonna happen when he find out his snitch killed himself? Lieutenant, I say we go now. You know the game, Tucker. We don't move until we get the warrant. Hello?! Tucker?! Damn it. Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to fifth and Maine? I don't have time. - Yeah, well you better make time! Come on, get around! Don't try no shit man, get around! Come on, move it! Now get your ass inside. Bar that door. Come on, let's go! All right, let's get outta here. Come on, move it! Get in the car, motherfucker! Did Stinger send you, man? Real smart boy, ain't ya? You're just like that old man friend of yours. He was a smart boy too, but he had a big mouth. Now you driving. Big shit, come on, let's go! Don't you try nothing funny either. You better wave those boys off or you're gonna die right here. That's a good boy. - Lieutenant Hayes, metro squad, give me the DA. Well call him in Florida, little lady. I'll wait. What are you doing?! - It's called rushing the system. My friend is out there alone. Come on, let's go. Come on, move it! Come on man, move it! I could've killed you back there, asshole. This is how I get my nut off. All right, I want you to get down for me. Stupid son of a bitch! All right, come to daddy. - You stupid son of a bitch! - Hurry, we mustn't leave a trace! - Stinger, what about the stuff in storage, we can't possibly- - Burn it, burn it all! Burn them?! But we'll be blown sky high! I said burn it! Yes sir. - Get off of there, get off! Burn it, burn it all! Burn it! Burn it now! Carl! Man, what the fuck is going on? What's happening man? - What's going on, Bucky, how you feeling? Where's Tucker? Bucky man... Come on, don't bullshit me, I already got the word. - Listen, it happened so fast, what could we do? You let my uncle get snatched right from under your noses? It's gonna be all right man, we're gonna get him back. It ain't up to you no more, I'm calling the shots from here on in. Bucky, let us deal with it. Where's the action, Carl? - At an old warehouse on the east side, man. Stinger sells his poison down there. All right, I'll ride with you. Buck, I don't think- Don't think man, move! - Steve, meet us at the warehouse. - Just got to get rid of everything! I'm a respected businessman in this community! Can I help you mister? Yeah! Give me some help! He's alone. But how?! That's what I call balls! - Hey, what's happening man, you need some help? This is an angel dust factory. Angel dust? Well let's kick ass then. I can dig it. I see Stinger's got you everywhere, telephone man!
