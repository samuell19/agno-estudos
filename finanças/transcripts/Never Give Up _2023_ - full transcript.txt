Welcome to the 15th World Games for the Deaf. You're joining our coverage of the men's singles tennis finals. I'm Dan Cort, along with good friend and tennis legend Stan Smith. Stan, good to see you. It's great to be here. Yeah, we really felt like there would be a little more drama and competition to this match, but it just hasn't turned out that way, has it? You're right, Dan. I really thought newcomer Brad Minns would have a great shot against the reigning gold medalist, Jeff Osborne. But that's not what's happening today. Yeah, Osborne won the gold in Cologne in '81 in men's singles and men's doubles. And he's just been dominant today, clinching the first two sets, and he's way up in the third, just points away from victory. So let's join the action on court number one. We are in the third set of the men's singles finals. Well, that just about seals the deal. It'll take a miracle now, Dan. Why are we coming if everyone else is leaving? Come on, Luis! This way. What are we doing? This event is not on my schedule. You're gonna get me fired from the paper. If you're going to date me, then you need to understand Deaf tennis. Brad, my mixed doubles partner. I promise you this will be the best match you've ever seen. Maybe not. That big dude is way ahead. Osborne is serving now for the match, so let's watch as USA's Jeff Osborne brings home the win. Yeah, Osborn! Osborne leads, 40-love. Five games to love. Third set. Game set, match point. Match point, Osborne. I know. God, help me. 40-15. 40-30. This is getting interesting. Minns is staying strong. It looks like Osborne is getting a bit tentative. Minns is really going for it. He's pressing Osborne, wow. 40-all. Deuce. This is what we've been expecting, this match. Out. Advantage Minns. Game, Minns. The kid can play. Osborne leads, five games to one, third set. Looks like we're staying. At least for one more game. My hearing aids were knocked out of my tennis bag. May I put them back? Yes, you may. Uh-uh! He can't leave the court on an even game. Unless the chair umpire grants him permission, which I did. That's bogus. Why does he need permission to go get his bag? You can only go to the bench over a changeover on odd numbered games. You cannot leave the court for any reason. And what if you have to go to the bathroom? Oh, you gotta hold it. There are some unique rules for Deaf tennis. For one, you can't play with hearing aids. Which means they're playing in complete silence. That's gotta be incredibly difficult. On the pro tour, sound is hugely important. Different shots sound differently. Minns has been Deaf since age three when he had a high fever as a child. That's hard to imagine. That must have been really scary. Yeah, I'll bet it was. I'm afraid it's not good news. Your boy's fever was intense. We estimate between 80% and 90% hearing loss. You mean, temporary? No. There's nothing you could have done differently. Now you have to make some hard decisions. Most families choose special education with sign language. Your son can be sent to a school for the Deaf where he'll be around others like himself. Is there another option? I mean... It's a much more difficult road. Teach him to lipread, maybe get a pair of high-end hearing aids. But I must warn you, they're very expensive and he will probably have a difficult time differentiating sound and word recognition due to the severity of his hearing loss. What do you think, Fran? Doc, what do you recommend? Look. You're both social people, and I don't mean to be harsh, but he's always going to be a Deaf kid in a hearing world. Institutionalization would probably be best. Come in. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. Oh my goodness. We've made our decision. Where do we get hearing aids and how do we teach him to lipread? Yeah. Come here. It's gonna be okay. We are gonna do this as a family. Mom, Dad, you've always been there. How am I supposed to do this without you? What is he asking you? Those seats are reserved for his parents. They come to all of his matches. They're flying from Toledo. They aren't here yet. Minns has amazing tenacity, we gotta say that. He's digging deep to keep fighting and staying in this match. Out. Can you imagine growing up and being the only Deaf kid and trying to figure out what's happening, say, at a ball game, or the movies, or even at school? It's gotta be tough. Hello, Mrs. Minns. I'm Ms. Dickerson. Hello, Ms. Dickerson. This is my son, Brad. Brad, this is Ms. Dickerson. Hello, Brad. You're going to need to put him in the front row so that he can read your lips. He's learning, but he's really quite good for his age. Can he hear anything? Barely. He can hear some muffled sounds. Does he speak? Yes, of course. Can he read and write? Brad is very smart. He does all of those things, he just can't hear. Excuse me for saying so, Mrs. Minns, but don't you think he should be at a Deaf school? Good Shepherd for the Deaf has a wonderful program. Ms. Dickerson, have you heard of a boy named Tom Edison? He was born not too far from here, Milan, Ohio? Of course, Thomas Edison, the famous inventor. 80% Deaf. Never went to a Deaf school. Neither will my son. Hmm. Thank you, Mrs. Minns. Come with me, young man. Rex, please take the empty seat. Look at sissy boy's mommy brings him to class. You can sit here! Osborne leads. The third set, six games to five. Who would've thought this was even possible? Minns has won five outta the last six games. Love-15. Minns suddenly has that look in his eye. He's in the zone. Love-30. Oh, Osborne sent Minns flying into the back fence. Come on, we can do this. Hey, let's go. Go get some ice cream afterwards. Good afternoon, Brad. Good afternoon. - Good to see you. - Good to see you. We brought these. Wonderful. We're gonna test your hearing for some new hearing aids today. Do you understand? Okay, good. I'm gonna put these on here. Okay. And raise your hand when you hear a beep, okay? Okay. Brad, did you hear the firetruck or did you just see the lights? I saw the lights. Okay, I need you to be really honest with me, okay? I'm gonna try something and maybe, maybe just maybe next time you'll hear a real firetruck. Okay? Hold on. Do you know what these are? Yes. They're real powerful hearing aids and you wear them on a harness like this. I want you to help me out, okay? I want you to hold them in your ears for me, and we're gonna fit you with the correct size once we do our next test, okay? And we'll fit you just perfect in a little bit. You put one there, Mom, you can help me out here. Okay, gonna do another test. Yes! Good job. You can hear that, Brad. That is wonderful. Good job. Yes, excellent. Oh, that is fantastic. All right, here we go, guys. - Wow. - Salad. - Thank you very much. - There you go, Mom. Absolutely. Big parfait for you, big man. Whoa, buddy. - Y'all enjoy. - Thank you. Hey Chubs, look what we have here. It's Brad Pee. The little boy who always needs his mommy. Yeah, he's a mommy's boy. And what's that around his neck? His hearing aid. No, that's his bra. Like my sister. Or maybe he's an alien like Uncle Martin from "My Favorite Martian." Boys, boys, boys, let's settle down, okay? Bring it in. Let's celebrate our win, okay? I like "My Favorite Martian." Don't listen to them. Okay? Whatever they're saying, he's just acting like a first grader. In a third grader's body. He's been held back twice. Might be a third time if he's not careful. Children can be mean. Okay? But you don't let them get to you. Ever. Looks like he's okay. Boy, I've seen a lot of tennis matches, but I don't think I've ever seen two guys fight this hard for every single point. Game, Minns. Games are six-all. Gentlemen, the set will be decided by a. Okay, Stan, you got your wish. Tiebreaker. A tiebreaker is a real test of tennis. Yeah, you won something like, what, 85% of the tiebreakers you played? What's the secret? Experience. It all goes back to training. I started playing tennis seriously when I was about 15, so I always felt that those guys that started earlier had something of an edge. So I had to practice harder and make up for lost time. When did Minns start playing tennis? Maybe around six or seven years old. That's pretty young. Makes a difference. Okay, Brad, this is a forehand grip. Okay, so look, the V between your thumb and your fingers goes against the side of the bevel of the racket like that. Here we go. See, just like you're shaking hands. My hand doesn't fit. Your hand is almost as big as mine, it'll fit. But it feels funny. You'll get used to it. I'll never get used to it. Okay. Listen to me, Bradford Minns. This is a sport you can play. You can be really good at this. But Mom! Patience. We'll take it one shot at a time. Minns's older brother Jimbo taught him how to play. Way to go, Jimbo. I imagine it's pretty challenging to teach a Deaf kid to play tennis. It's tough teaching any kid to play tennis. I was so clumsy at first, they wouldn't even let me be a ball boy. That's too hard, Jimbo. You want me to go easy on you, Brad? Yeah. I'm just learning. Mom told me not to baby you. That's 'cause I'm not a baby. Exactly. You can do this. I doubt it. It's too tough. Hang in there, little bro. Let's work on your serve. I'll never be good at this. If I can't hit a forehand, there's no way I'll be able to hit a serve. Look, dork butt. Mom told me to teach you, so you will learn. The tiebreaker score remains tied, 10-all. Out! Second serve. A very close call. Wow! Service ace. Takes guts to go for that big second serve like that. Holy cow, Minns took the set! Third set, Minns. Seven, six. Set score stands. Two sets for Osborne, one set for Minns. Now we've got a match. What's going through Osborne's head at this point? He's gotta find a way to turn the tide on Minns' momentum. You've been in spots like this. What did you do? Anything. Everything you can do to bring it back. You can't get ahead of yourself. Back in 1971, I remember thinking at about winning and dancing at the Wimbledon Ball. Yeah. Yeah, and then you lost the next two sets to Newcombe. Yeah, my point exactly. It's not over until it's over. Okay, concentrate. Come on, Brad, you can do this. Focus. Stay in this, focus. I need some inspiration. We'll take it one shot at a time. Both these players are incredibly resilient. Big kudos to the coach of Team USA, Mike LaPierre, on their training. I wonder if it's more than that. If the obstacles these guys faced growing up Deaf helped prepare them for a moment like this. Oh. Oh, gotcha. Brad! Bradley Minns! Bradford. My name is Bradford. Well, right now your name is mud. No, really. It's not Bradley, it's Bradford. You must pay attention, young man. Your disability doesn't entitle you to stare out the window when I am teaching. Yes ma'am. The reason you're in the front row is so that you can read my lips and pay attention. Do you think you can do that? I don't know. Your lips move very fast. Do they? Now you're criticizing my teaching too. No ma'am. But if you could just slow down, maybe say the words with a little bit better diction? What? You know, pronouncing better and slower? I know what diction means, but I'm not slowing down my teaching for any of the students. It's your job to keep up. Okay, class. Let's go through some of our vocabulary words. All right. Bradley... Bradford. Now let's think about how to say this word. Sorry? Sorry. Please do not answer out loud until you're given permission. Back off! You ungrateful little troublemaker. Now let's see what the principal has to say about your unseemly behavior. But what about them? I'd worry about you. They will be learning the next five spelling words and be getting prepared for a pop quiz when I return. I am not paid enough for this kind of rudeness. This child belongs in a special school. Come in. What seems to be the problem this time, Ms. Dickerson? This young man is unruly and doesn't belong here. Well, where does he belong? In a school for the Deaf. Is he Deaf? Well, yes. Young man, do you understand me? Does he talk? Yes sir. Well, if he's Deaf, how did he understand me? He reads lips. Have you not been reading my memos? I don't like memos. Looks like he's wearing hearing aids. Well, they don't work very well. When I turn my back to write on the board, he doesn't learn a thing. Young man, do you think you should be here? Maybe you belong with people who can help you better than we can. Well, you got hearing aids and you're here. I lost most of my hearing in World War II. I was a tank commander. Did you know General Patton? He's a hero. My dad let me see the movie. I served under General Patton in the Battle of the Bulge. 761st Tank Battalion. The Black Panthers? The greatest tank battalion the army ever had! I don't know about that. Your motto was "Come out fighting." I like that. Ms. Dickerson, you have a great opportunity here. Don't ever turn your back on this young man. But Principal. Literally. When you turn your back, he can't read your lips. Now can he? Dismissed. Yes, Principal Boyd. Come on, young man. Let's see if we can learn some math. Black Panthers. You got sent to the principal's office. It. That's where a Minns boy should never be found. It wasn't my fault! Doesn't matter. It matters to me. Ms. What's Her Name doesn't like me. I'm sure Ms. Dickerson is doing her best. Stay outta the principal's office. We don't need any more trouble. But Principal Boyd is really cool. He served under General Patton! You didn't tell him you saw that movie? Fran, what was the rating on that? GP, I think. The kids make fun of me. They think I belong in a special school, that I don't belong with regular kids. Maybe they're right. Hey. Are you a man or a mouse? Man? That's right. I knew I did not like that teacher. You can't fight City Hall. There are no quitters in the Minns family. Okay, you are every bit as smart and every bit as talented as any other kid at that school. You just have to prove it to them. But how? They all hate me. They don't hate you. Well, they treat me like a freak. You need to learn to get along. And don't go to the principal's office. I'm trying. May I please be excused? I need to finish my homework. Both of you. Are you sure we're doing the right thing? Absolutely. And I pray every day that Ms. What's Her Name does too. Ms. Dickerson. You know I know what you know her name is. Thanks. Wow, what's this for? Well, what did you do yesterday? Got a C on my math test? That was, C's for Clever. Okay, who did you beat at tennis? Jimbo. Ah. Took a set off me fair and square. Now I have to go back to playing baseball. We are going to get you a new tennis teacher. You are going to be a great tennis player, Bradford Minns. I'll settle for pretty good. You are going to be great. So, you want to win at tennis? Yes sir, Mr. Davis. Then we're gonna make you a champion. Get around this one. Good. Here. Good job. Yes. Feeling it? Watch it. Great! Give it here. We videotaped your lesson. We videotaped your lesson so you can see exactly what I'm saying. Then, maybe if you're lucky, your parents will buy you a Betamax machine so you can take the tape home and you can watch. All right, step around it. Right through. Nice job. High. Yes. Can you hear the ball hit your strings? No. Can you hear the ball when it hits my strings? No. Then you're gonna need to watch the ball very closely. Watch how it hits my racket. Watch the speed. What's the spin? Do you understand? Sort of, but what difference does the spin make? Okay. If you hit the ball like this, catching over the top of it, that's called top spin. That's gonna make the ball bounce higher. If you hit the ball like this, kind of like a karate chop, slicing it, that's gonna make the ball drop faster. That's underspin. You're gonna need to learn both if you want to be a great tennis player. Am I gonna be a great tennis player? Well, that depends on you. On how I play? On how you think. What you believe in here. What about these? What about 'em? I can't hear the ball hit the strings or the other players. Or even my coach. You need to make up for what you can't hear with what you can see. Watch the fuzz of the ball as it hits my racket. Mom says I should watch the seams. Your mom's a smart woman. I like that. Watch the seams of the ball over and over and over and then slam it! Now you try. Gonna teach you how to volley. Again. Oh, one more, ready? And harder! Harder! Deuce. They're still slugging away. And Osborne is not going to give up anytime soon. Yeah, neither is Minns. It's tough to keep this level of play this deep into a match. Somebody has to crack. Come on, man, you can't do that. Easy put away, you can't give any points away. Oh, oh, that doesn't look good. No, it doesn't. Game, Osborne. He leads three games to two, fourth set. That's his calf. Is that bad? If it's popped, he's cooked, but if it's strained, he might have a chance. Tough break. Oh man, that must be painful. It's a sharp stinging pain. I'm sure he's strained his calf muscle before, but he's gonna have to massage the muscle a little bit, get it loosened up, and figure out a way to keep Osborne on the run. So. So all Minns has to do is come back and win the set while playing in sharp, stinging pain? Is that even possible? Well, you watch. This kid never gives up. Look, you bunch of freshman dweebs. We've got one open spot on this team left. And I should just... Unless you can play as tough as Nastase, you should go home now. What'd you say? I said that a little wussy cream is not gonna help you get on this team, crip. Ha, you stink. Oh, really? Coach. We got a problem. The kid with the bum calf muscle? Yeah. He's Deaf too. And how can he play tennis if he can't hear? I think we should cut him. Cut who? Hello, gentlemen. Francis Minns. Assistant Coach Phil Hogarth. Coach Perry. Mm-hmm. That is my son, Brad. He's going to be a tremendous asset to your team. Careful. He can read lips. He knows everything you're saying. Let him... Let him try out against Duke with no special treatment. Understand me? Okay. What is going on with you? I strained my calf muscle. It's really sore. Well, you're just going to have to run the other boy around. These guys don't want me, Mom. You can do this, Brad. You just have to show 'em, one point at a time. Come on over here, Minns. Come on over here, Minns! You're gonna play our captain, Duke. You don't need to shout at him. I'm gonna wipe you off the face of the earth, you freshman slime. Analyze your opponent's game and then pummel him into the ground. Strong forehand, top spin backhand. Let me move this guy around. All right. How about a lob? Okay, now let's see what happens if I hit it right at him. This guy's pretty good. That freshman nobody looks as good as our number one singles player. He sure does, Phil. Look at him run Duke around. Well done, Minns! He can't hear you. I don't need him to hear. I need him to win. Minns leads five games to three, fourth set. The crowd's getting into it. I think the fans have been filling up ever since Minns started fighting back. We're seeing how tough Brad Minns really is. He has to stay focused. 40-love. Osborne's won the last three points. Minns' lead is about to disappear. Out, 40-15. Every time you think Minns is finished, he just keeps fighting. Now if he comes back from 40-love, that'll be something. Okay, time to attack. 40-30. 40-all, deuce. Deuce. This kid is scrappy. And it looks like he's moving better on that leg. Advantage Minns. Holy cow! Minns somehow returned it and he takes the game! This is a perfect example of why Deaf tennis is more difficult than the kind of matches I played. I would've heard the ball hit the strings. Osborne didn't. Oh, that's a great point. Game and fourth set to Minns, six games to three. How about that? Just like Bjorn Borg. Or like Jimmy Connors. I told you this was the match to watch. You were right. Great save. Very. And so what should Minns be thinking about now? Right now, he's gotta think about the basics. Everything he learned in the hours of hitting, conditioning his body, and listening to his coaches. We're late. It's time to win, Finn. Hello, hit the road, Toad. Time to shake, Jake. Time to fly, Guy. What's the fuss, Gus? I feel weird. What do you mean you feel weird? They hear a little better. That's wonderful, son! Is that the new hearing aids? Yeah. That's great! Now get out there and make the team. I know they don't want me. They don't know you yet. No one's gonna hand you a position on that college team. And you've known that your whole life. You have to be the best. You have to be better than the best. You played on your high school varsity tennis team as a freshman. You played number one singles as a senior. You have the under 18 number one singles ranking in northwestern Ohio and the number three doubles ranking in the Western Tennis Association. And you know what else you got, many people don't? New hearing aids? You have charisma. And those folks at the University of Toledo have never seen anyone like you. Do you understand? Now I know why my dad is so good at sales. Charisma! Brad, you can win this. You have charisma. Charisma, charisma, charisma, charisma. - Hey, good one. - Thanks. Well? How'd you do? Pretty well, I think. Hey, no matter what happens, know that your mother and I love you very much. I want you to work harder than anyone. I want you to focus on your goals. And I don't want you to listen to anyone try to tell you what you can't do. Okay, let's go home. All right. Could you drop me at the gym? I gotta strengthen my calves. You just played almost four hours of tennis and you want to go to the gym. You're in the best shape of any tennis player I know. Gotta be better than the best. Perfect. ! iEs estupendo! Game, Minns. He leads four games to three, fifth set. Four to three. Nobody wants to go home a loser. Nobody will. This match has lasted almost five hours. Four hours and 53 minutes. This is some match. I wonder what Minns is reading. He's looking for checkout time. He may need to extend his hotel stay for another night. It could be. Yeah, this is the longest match I've ever seen. So let us run the race that is before us and never give up. Your mother's paraphrase of Hebrews 12:1. So who do you think will win? Player with the best coach. Oh, you can quote me on that. He's the coach for both players. I got it. Brad Minns has worked harder than any player I have ever seen. Maybe all those extra hours in the gym will pay off. - Hey, Coach. - Hey, Brad. Your high school coach told me what to expect, but honestly I've never seen such hard work from a walk on. Thanks. How does a scholarship sound? Sound? I probably shouldn't use that word. Sounds great. What position do you think I'll play? Number three singles, maybe number two doubles for now. I... I hear you loud and clear. Or I read your lips loud and clear. This might be of some interest to you also. World Games for the Deaf? What's that? Deaf Olympics. Tennis is a sport. Tryouts are next week. I hear... I hear. A lot of great international players are participating. Maybe you could play for Team USA. Do you really think I'm that good? You're the best Deaf tennis player I know. How many Deaf tennis players do you know? One. They have a spot for me to try out if I want. What do you think? Tryouts are next week? Yeah. And being on the Rockets tennis team doesn't get you on the squad. No, I have to try out. Where? Gallaudet University in DC. Do we have that in the budget? Remember last time we took the boys to DC, it was pretty pricey. You and I can road trip it. Just like when you and Jimbo go fishing. We can stay in the dorm. Okay, but.. But you have to win or lose quickly because I have a sales meeting in Toledo on Thursday afternoon I can't miss. I will crush them all. Oh, I think we've created a monster. It says here that Abraham Lincoln founded Gallaudet University in 1864 and President Ulysses S. Grant attended the first commencement in 1869. What's a Gallaudet? He was a guy who started the first school for the Deaf and helped develop sign language. Do you see the tennis courts? Let's ask somebody. Hey, ask him. Uh, excuse me, do you know... What'd he say? I have no idea. I don't know sign language. Me neither. Ask those girls. Excuse me. Can you tell me where the tennis courts are? It looks like you offended them. Think it's my Ohio accent? Eh. Let's do what your mother and I did in France. Point at the ad. There you go. Calm down, young man! You speak? Of course I speak. And a piece of advice. This is a university for the Deaf. Everyone can see you just fine, so you can drop the wild gestures and quit making fun of the hard of hearing, especially here. I'm not, I'm sorry. Can you tell me where the tennis courts are? Out back of the field house. What did she say? I couldn't read her lips. Over by the field house. What is a field house? It's kinda like a big indoor gym. What am I doing wrong? Why don't these people like me? They don't think you're Deaf. Cool. I'm Brad. What's your name? I don't know what you're signing. Do you know where we can find Mike LaPierre? The tennis coach? Hey, I'm Coach LaPierre. You must be Brad Minns. That's me. All right. - And you're Deaf? - I am. Hey, Brad's dad. We taught Brad how to read lips as a boy, so just make sure he can see your lips when you're speaking to him. No need to sign with him. Oh, okay. Well, dorms are over that way. And here's your schedule. You play tomorrow. Thanks. You do sign right? Nope, never had to. Never met a Deaf person until I got here. You made it through elementary school, high school, and college by reading lips? That's right. And with help from my family. Well... You should be very proud. Yeah. Go get some rest. You have a tough match tomorrow. You're playing against the number one singles player from the last World Games for the Deaf. All right? Okay. Nothing like an easy first round. Yeah. Let's go find the dorm. Oh, thank you. Is that a you're welcome? I'm not sure about that hand gesture. Means something completely different to my Italian friends. Okay. Nice. Good. Hi, do you know where room 313 is? I don't know what she said. I think the room's right over here. 213. Here we are. I call top bunk. Okay, yeah. Okay. Hey, going to the little boys' room. Oh, bathroom? I'm sorry, I don't know what that means. Yes, thank you. There's, yes, there's got to be a bathroom around here somewhere. Those are the courts that I will try out on tomorrow. Gotta get some rest and kick some butt. This is my chance to be the best. Brad, wake up, wake up. What's happening? I'm not sure. I think the fire alarm went off. You didn't hear it? No, there's no alarm sound. It's just flashy lights. No, it's just, it was just flashing lights. Ah, I'm sorry, I don't know sign language. Mimms? Minns. M-I-N-N-S. Jeff Osborne. Number one singles. Ah, look forward to playing you tomorrow. Me too. You don't sign? Not at all. I lip read. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, good morning. Good morning. Yeah. Yeah. Good morning. Oh, it's all clear. The fire drill is finished. Good morning. Hey, you guys okay? It was just a fire drill. Yeah, no, we're fine, thank you. All right. Hey, look what I learned to sign. Whoa. Do you know what that means? Yeah, good morning. I figured it's an early morning, so good morning. That means "Up yours." This means good morning. See? Osborne. You know, I was thinking, maybe we need to learn how to sign a few words correctly. Yeah, sure, sure. Something like, "Hey baby, you wanna go on a date with me?" I was thinking more like thank you or you're welcome. You're thinking too small, my boy. Minns, you're late. Sorry, Coach. I was at the gym working out. Before your match? I always work out an hour before I play. Well, that's fine. Get your butt over to court number one, all right? You'll be playing Osborne. Stay away from his girlfriend. What? Okay, thank you. Where are my rackets? Hey, son. Where's your rackets? I left them here a minute ago. Well, we gotta find them. Okay. I'll keep looking. What's the problem now? Somebody swiped my rackets. Brad, look, you're not in Ohio anymore, okay? You can't just leave your rackets unattended in Washington DC. I know that now. What do you play with? Prince. I could loan you a Wilson or maybe a Head racket. That's it. Oh, Brad doesn't sign. Oh, you can use mine. I already qualified. Here. I string it like a man's racket, but the grip is a bit smaller. Oh, this is perfect. Thank you. Okay, go. Thank you. You're welcome. Sorry, I'm sorry I'm late. Let's play. Kid's better than I thought. Should be a good match. Yeah. Jeff doesn't like to lose. Good to know. Coach. What now? He can't play with those. What? Why not? Olympic rules. He can't use hearing aids in competition. He shouldn't be allowed to use them to qualify. I apologize, this is my first Deaf coaching job. I should have made that call. Brad, you're gonna have to play without your hearing aids. I've never played without 'em before. I'm sorry. That's the rules. I'm playing in complete silence with a borrowed racket against the reigning gold medalist. Good luck. When will I stop having to prove myself? How many times do I have to face this in a hearing world and now in a Deaf world? When will it get easier? When will people just accept me for who I am and what I can do? Yes! That's it, I won! Nice match. Oh, I don't sign. Congratulations on beating the reigning world champion. Thank you. Yeah. I'll be more prepared next time. I'm glad you're on our side. Does that mean that I made the team? Thanks. Uh... Deb. I think I found my mixed doubles partner. As long as we don't have to share the same racket. I found your rackets in the dumpster. Oh. Hazing the new guy. Oh. What, what's hazing? It's kinda like really bad teasing, it's... I'm used to that. Hey, I'm glad you found your rackets, all right? But could you do me a favor? Please don't flirt with your potential mixed doubles partner. Why does everyone think I'm flirting? I'm just trying to be nice. You do. All right, hit the showers. I'll announce who made the team in half an hour in the cafeteria, all right? We're good. Listen, I gotta go find a phone and call the office, so I'll meet you there. Can you take my rackets? Yeah, yeah, I'll lock 'em up in the trunk. Do you have clean clothes? My backpack. Here. Hey, Dad. Yeah? Thanks for everything. It was a nice win. Where's my towel? And my backpack? Really? I was waiting until we were all here, but I guess Minns got held up. Okay. Congratulations. Give him back his clothes. Come on. Does this mean I made the team? Yes, it does. Congratulations. Get dressed. Nice abs. Welcome to the Deaf Olympic team. This is where the finals match will be played. Can I beat 32 players from around the world? Can I make it through four rounds to play on this court? I feel like everything in my life has been leading up to this moment. I'm Bill Austin. Brad Minns. I've been watching you, Minns. You use Starkey hearing devices, right? Ever since I was a little kid. I know you can't use them in the matches, but can I fit you with some new high-end models we're testing? They are the best ever. Interested? Thank you, Mr. Austin, but that's not really in my budget. I'm a University of Toledo college student and I just spent most of my savings just to get here. I believe in you, son. You're why I make these hearing aids, so you can do your best, be a champion. No matter what anyone else has to say. I know your whole life has been a struggle. Let me do this one thing to help. This pair's on me. But. We're standing here at 5:30 a.m. and you've already run five miles. Let me help you. I'll see you after your finals match, Brad. How do you know I'm gonna be in the finals? You will be. Game, Minns. He leads five games to four, fifth set. Does this remind you of your '73 Davis Cup doubles match? Yeah, that was a long one. Erik van Dillen and I were playing against Cornejo and Fillol of Chile. Yeah, so listen to this score, folks. Seven-nine. 37-39. Four hours. Eight-six, six-one, six-three. Ha, go tiebreakers. 122 games to win the match? That was an amazing match, but we didn't come back from two sets down and three match points. If Minns wins this one more game, he's got the gold medal. Or he loses two games and Osborne retains the crown. Are you trying to ruin Minns' Cinderella story? No, no. I'm just saying that in this match, Stan, anything can happen. Fair enough. 15-love. See? Osborne's not gonna go down easy. That's an understatement. 15-all. 30-all. Great lob. Just out of Minns' reach. Perfect shot. Incredible volley. Advantage, Minns. Match point, Minns. Honestly, Stan, I'm amazed to say those words. You know, if Brad Minns can pull this off, I think it will be the greatest comeback in collegiate, Olympic, or professional tennis. We'll take it one shot at a time. You have charisma. You can do it. Think about what you're doing. Plan your next shot. Good match. Thanks. Game, set, and match, men's USA. Four-six, five-seven, seven-six, six-three, six-four. Good match. - Good match. - Thank you. I've never seen a better match. That's the match of a lifetime for both these players. Congrats, Team USA. Great job. Bradford! My boy did it! I was so worried, but were you okay? You made it. Oh, it was a thunderstorm in Chicago and then they put us on the tarmac for three hours and they flew to San Diego! No, we're so sorry, we're so sorry. We were thinking of you every second, I promise. It looked like it worked, that's a gold medal! I love you guys so much. You're the reason why I'm here. Excuse me, sorry. Can I get a quote for tomorrow's paper? Yes. This has been the most amazing tennis match I've ever seen. I never came back from that far down before in my life. Hey. You have been coming back your whole life. Yeah. Thank you. I'm the best tennis player in the world. Yeah, you are. Just like you said I would be. We did it as a family. Ah, there's only one name on this gold medal, Brad. Today, you did it. You did it. I was never really alone. Good work. - Hey, we did it, Dad. - Oh my god. - Hey, we got there. - We got there. You did it. So, so proud. I can't believe... Hearing is a lot different than listening. I'm still listening to what God wants me to do, one day at a time. What I wanted to do tonight, I wanted to give Bill something back to say thank you for everything he's done for me. And good Lord spoke to me and he said, "Brad, give Bill Austin your gold medal." Mr. Austin, I just want to say thank you so much for everything you've done for me. I share this gold medal with everybody who realizes, no matter what the score, no matter how tough things seem, or how down you may be, never give up. Never give up.
