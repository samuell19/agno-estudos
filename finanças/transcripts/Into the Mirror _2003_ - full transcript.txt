Self-hatred, triggered by a mental shock, causes a personality to split, and you perceive two worlds, inside and outside the mirror The world is divided into two symmetrical worlds, that is, the person is psychologically divided in two If you die outside the mirror you can still be living within Also, if the you in the mirror dies, you see no reflection Do you see someone else in the mirror too?
