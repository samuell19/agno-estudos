Extract and clean up. Nothing more. Who's there? I keep asking myself, how did I get here? Started out as an opportunity to make things right. A chance to be one of the good guys. "Good guys." There are no good guys. Good guys don't exist. It's just you and the bullshit you tell yourself so you can move on to the next moment. I sacrificed everything, as I believed the lies I was told. That ends now. You have to be willing to die for what you believe in. Or believe me, you're already dead. Ellis. Ellis, I know you're there. Listen. There's no way out, other than death, and you knew this. I'm done, man. - You're done? - I said I'm fuckin' done. I wish it were that easy. There's no way, with all that you know, that we're just gonna let you be done. Look, you're done when we say you're done! I'm done, man! I fuckin' said I'm done! - I'm not askin'. - And neither are we. You're one of our best agents. There's no denying that. But if you try to leave, I assure you, we will hunt you down and we will use all of our resources to find you, and we will, and when we do, we will kill you. Is that all you called me for, man? Finish this last situation for us, and maybe I can convince them to hear you out. Is that it? Well when you complete this job, it'll work in your favor. Fuck you. I knew you were gonna say that. Consider it, Ellis! Needless to say, this is a very dangerous situation. High-risk. If these files end up in the wrong hands and this job go bad it could be catastrophic. Look, you wanna leave? Fine. Give us our file back and then we can talk about it. Fuck, fuck you! - Fuck me? - Fuck you! You're the one who's fucked! You have family, no friends, no nothin'! Just your little legacy here with us! You've done some great work for us, so I won't mix words. Bring us our file back or we'll send Kristof to retrieve it. I don't give a fuck who comes looking for me. Bring 'em. Neither you or me will want that. Just bring us our file back. That sound you just heard? That's our next mission. Let us know when it's done. Oh! And Ellis... Take the girl back. She's not worth the trouble. I don't, I, I don't- - Before you say you don't know what I'm talkin' about, we both know you do. You got 24 hours. Fuck you. Alexander. Get a hold of Sparkle. Yeah. I've got a problem. Fuck. Fuck. So... I keep asking myself, how did I get here? When all I wanted to be was one of the good guys. Esteban, I fucked up. I've lost the file and I need you to find it. And to make matters worse, there's a girl. What do you mean there is a girl? She was standing there and I just fuckin' took her. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Ellis, you know the rules. I know. Get rid of the girl immediately. I will find the files. I will be in touch. Hey. You sleep well? You sleep okay? You hungry? I asked you in the car and you didn't say anything. Look, I know life is crazy right now. But they got some people that are trying to hurt me. That means this place isn't really safe. Do you have anybody you can call? Is there anybody... I can't... Don't, don't do that. Don't do that. Don't. Don't cry. Don't. Damn. This might be my best one yet. I'm gonna just go set it down. Sorry I'm late. I was at the other house when you texted. We good? Never better. Look, I need you to go back to the house. Scan the perimeter, make sure everything's everything. Can you do that for me? Anything I need to be worried about? You heard from Sparkle, man? Keep looking. We good? Never better. But you want me to go and sweep the house? You got a problem with that? And if I find anything? Do what you do. Ellis! Ellis! Look, we need our file, Ellis! No, I'm too fuckin' tired of waitin', Ellis! Didn't I tell you? I warned you, Kristof is off the leash! I can't, 'cause I lost the fuckin' files! So now what? Didn't I ask you to bring the girl back? Well, fuck Kristof. I'm comin'. Listen to me. - You okay? - What do you want, Kristof? Hey. Don't get mad at me. This is not my fault. I'm just doing my job. And what exactly is that? Your job. Takin' care of loose ends. Is that what you are, Ellis? A loose end? You tell me. You gotta admit, you botched your last job. Got your ass whipped and lost the prospect, who then handed the files that she stole over to the Russians. In our business, that's not good. It was only a matter of time before you and those misfits screwed up. I told you before and I'm telling you now for the last time. The agency doesn't like when you're careless. Sooner or later, they're gonna get tired of you, and then... Well... You know. What do I know? Huh, Kristof? What do I know? You've been warned, Ellis. Hi. Alex said you were looking for me. What do you want? So it's like that? Yeah, that's how it is. I quit. You can quit? I didn't think they just let people quit. They don't. Well, what do you want from me? A going-away party? I just wanted you to know, okay? I just wanted you to know. Where you at these days? Where you livin'? I'm with friends. You need anything? I'm good! I'm good. You are the one calling me, right? So... I just need you to look into something for me, that's it. I'll let you know, if you let me know what's up. All right. All right, so, there's this guy lookin' for me, right? They sent him to kill me. So the thing is, I gotta find him before he finds me. So this is what I need you to do. I'm sending you a picture now. Didn't I tell you? I warned you! Kristof is off the leash! There's no way out, other than death, and you knew this. Bring us our file back. Consider it, Ellis! You're the one who's fucked! You have no family, no nothin'! Take the girl back. She's not worth the trouble. Excuse me. May I help you? Yeah, I'm just looking for Maria. Is she... She's gone for the night. Maybe I can help you. You and me are a lot alike. I can tell. You see the opportunity, you take advantage of it. It's crazy when you think about it. You rack your brain, trying to come up with answers. All along, it was sittin' right there in front of you. I'll be damned. Hi. Hi. I have to run an errand real fast. Please, do not answer the door. Stay away from the windows and don't use your phone. Can you remember that? Good. What size are you? It's just, you're the same size as my ex-wife. She has a closet full of some really nice stuff in there that I think will fit you and... If you wanna get outta that, you just take a shower and, um, get changed up, if you feel like it, okay? If you want. Okay? But I really gotta go. Um... Really need you to not answer the door, right? And stay away from the windows. Don't answer the phone. Yeah. I'll be right back. Sparkle. - This is crazy. - Sparkle, calm down. There are so many girls. So many young girls. Sparkle. Sparkle, listen to me. Don't "Sparkle" me! Don't "Sparkle" me. It's not even my name. Don't "Sparkle" me. I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm sorry. You okay? Don't worry about me. I found him, if that's what you're wondering. You found him? Where are you? I lost him. Do me a favor. Don't call me anymore. This is the first and the last time I do something like this for you. I understand. Anything I can do? I'll find him, but after that, I'm through. There's gotta be a better way to make money. I'll be in touch. When you find him, be careful. He's dangerous. I'm a big girl. Besides, danger is my middle name. Thirsty? I'm good. - Really? - Yeah. - You look like thirsty. - I do? I'm the kinda man that gets what I'm looking for. Do you understand? I've done a lot of things in my life I'm not proud of. Some of it I regret. Right now, I'm just searching. For what? I just want to feel... I just want to feel again. Feel what? Do you know what it is I do for a living? No. No. Let's just cut the bullshit, and talk about why I'm really here, how about that? You have a blonde that works for you. I believe she's Russian. She took something that belongs to me. I want it back. I called you. You said you were gonna look into it and... I understand you have a problem with one of my girls. - I do. - You do? - Mm-hm. - Mm-hm. And? In the past, there have been so many girls of your liking, and since most of my girls are Russian, it was hard to find the one you were looking for. Mm. But I did find her. You found her? And I spoke with her personally. You spoke to her personally? - Mm-hm. - And? Unfortunately, she doesn't seem to have any of your property. I apologize for the inconvenience, but maybe you've misplaced it somewhere else? That is unfortunate. Because the people who need that file, they're willin' to do unimaginable things to you, to get it back, and I don't wanna see that happen. Once again. - I apologize. - You apologize. I wish we could be of more help. But since we don't have what you're looking for, maybe I can interest you in something else? Something more suitable to a man of your taste? Do you mind if I look around a little bit? I really need that file. Too bad. 'Cause we don't have it. - I gotta get that. - Mm-hm. No, but seriously, I gotta get it. Mm-hm. Okay, so I'm gonna get it. I'll be right back, okay? Esteban. Talk to me. I hope you haven't kill anyone. Why is that? One. I like visiting that place when I come to town. Two. The file you're looking for is no longer there. You sure about that? You... You drive me crazy. Can you put your hands on it? Not without making a mess. I thought you're supposed to be the best at what you do. - You're makin' messes now? - I'm as good as it gets. But the Russians have it under heavy control. You're the only one that knows about this problem? I doubt it. Okay, I gotta go. I'm offering you my services. Mr. Esteban. Thank you, but no thank you. - If you change your mind- - I won't. Is there something I can do to change your mood? I have to go. But I'll be back. Can't wait. The house is empty. Only way is through the front door which already unlocked. The alarm's been set on, so you'll know if anyone or anything is movin'. And I already swept the house and the perimeter, so, nothin' to worry about. I'll keep watch through night, make sure you're safe. You gonna tell me? Tell you what? What's on the file. You the police now? You interrogating me? You need to know what's in the file? The kinda shit that if... The kind of information that if it got out... It ain't good. Anything else? Can I ask you another question? Can I stop you? Who, who... Who's the girl? Goodnight, Mr. Alexander. Goodnight. Call Sparkle. What do you want, Ellis? I told you, I'll find this guy and then I'm done. I've gotta find the file before he finds me. Is that all? No. I need you to pick something up for me. No. - Come on, Sparkle. - No. Word is, they're already looking for me. Please, help me. Anything else? There's a farmhouse on the outside of town. - Bye. - Yeah. Julia? Julia? Julia! Julia! Julia! I gotta get you outta here, away from me. What're you doing? I'm leaving. Where you going? You said you ain't got nobody. I'll find a place. Hey. Don't. What? What do you want? I know what I don't want. I don't want you to go. Which is... It's scary, is all. Stay with me. There are times in life when you make a decision and you know, you know in that very moment, your life will never be the same. Nice. Nice. Very nice. What is it? I said nice. So obviously, I'm not talking to you. Special occasion, correct? Mm-hm. Very. Yeah. Then this one must be best. So, you gonna tell me who she is? Excuse me? The most important part of a properly made suit is the lining. The extra fabric, it's an added layer, between the outside shell, and your body. So... You can have 1,000 things goin' on in the inside, but on the outside, perfect. The only time I've ever saw you this nervous is when you met your wife. - You know somethin' else? - Mm-hm. When you're hiding somethin', your left eye twitches. - My left eye's twitchin'? - Yeah, like it's doin' now. It's the girl from the other night, isn't it? You done? You finished? I'll be back in an hour. - Make it two. - Mm-hm. Oh, and Ellis? Be careful. My eye ain't twitchin'. Hi. So, did you find my file? I told you, I don't have it. What about the Russian girl who took it? That girl doesn't exist. Bye, Maria. Don't you wanna know why I called you? - Okay, ciao. - Wait, okay. Yeah. Hey. Don't hang up. What do you have? There is a man, a very dangerous man, that wants you dead. He's American, white, cold. Real stand-offish type. Blonde hair. And? He said his name was... Kristof? Look, I gotta go. Be careful. Yeah. Alexander. Talk to me. I need you to go to the other safe house. The one in the mountains? Yeah. Yeah, that one. Secure it. On it. The house. Everything around it. It'll be great. You comin'? Yeah, I'm comin'. - And I'm bringin' the girl. - Of course you are. Feels like I've been fighting for somethin', one thing or another, my whole life. First it was honor. Then it was my beliefs. And now it's for love. They say there's always one thing that happens. One event that changes your whole life forever. I never believed that shit. Until now. Help! Somebody, help! Help! Please! Somebody, help! Hey. Are you awake? I am now. Can I ask you something? Anything. Anything? Anything. Why me? I mean, look at you. You could have anybody you want. Why me? Well... You're fine, for one. - I'm tryin' to be serious. - Yeah, so am I. - This is my serious face. - Oh, okay. Why are you asking? I don't wanna fuck this up, you know? What do you mean? Just my life, you know. Things I do. A lot of people wanna hurt me. I'd be dead already if it wasn't for you. That's sweet. It's true. My turn. - Your turn? - Mm. I've got something I wanna tell you. Oh, really? You got somethin' you wanna tell me? That I had to wake you up to tell me? - I was dreaming about it and- - Oh, did it just... - Like an epiphany? - Yeah, yeah. I don't think . Mm-hm, okay. So you had an epiphany. I want to hear all about it. Say it, come on. - I don't know. - Hey. You ain't got nothin' to worry about. Ain't nobody gonna do nothin' to you. Say whatever you want. Say it. I love you. What? I love you. Stop. Just stop talking like that. Why? 'Cause you don't know what you're talking about. That's why. I don't know what I'm talking about? I want you to stop talking about it. - Why? - Stop. - Why? - Because! Why not? 'Cause you don't know what you're talking about. - Yes, I do. - No, you don't. - Yes, I do. - Why you wanna do this? Do what? Why you wanna mess things up? Like, things are going great. Aren't you happy? - Yes, I'm happy! - Okay, good! - Then why you wanna- - That's what I'm saying! You love me? - Yes. - How do you know? - I just do. - How? I just do. And I think you love me, too. Am I wrong? Forget it. - Hey. - No. - Just stop! - No, why? - Why? - 'Cause I need you to stay. That's why. Because you love me? Why? 'Cause I need you. That's not enough. Why? Why're you doing this to me? Okay, fine. I love you. You hear that? Yes. You happy now? - Yes. - You suck. You suck! You suck, you're the worst. - You're the worst ever. - Oh, I tell you what. - You made me work so hard. - Oh, I tell you- - You know, I knew it. I love you. It's not smart. I love you too, baby. Yeah, you do. You love me. Yeah, I love you. Better. You must be Ashley. You can have your seat. Man's like beautiful thing. There is a lot thing you can for me. But nothing now. I'm good. Sorry to keep you waiting. I know this is not what you do, and rarely ever do you come out. So, thank you. But, I understand the need for secrecy. No problem. Thank you, my friend. Have a seat. First thing first. I found the ring you're looking for. Took me some time. But I found it. How do you know it's the real thing? Take a look. Thank you. Today's your lucky day. I guess so. Man. What a beautiful place. You think so? My wife loves this place. 'Cause I don't accept any returns. What an interesting guy you are. - It's clean? - Of course! - Untraceable? - Abso-fucking-lutely. - And loaded? - Always. Thank you. I know you said you wouldn't need my services anymore. But if there is anything else, you know where to find me. How does that feel? Nice. Real good. Thank you. Big day's coming. Yeah. Nervous? No. I've been waiting on this day for a long time. Gotta look my best, you know. Ow! So what is this now for us? 16, 17? 20. 20? Are you sure? Yeah. - 20. - Ow. Sorry. And don't you always look your best? Yes. I do. Sorry about that. It's okay. This will be no different. - Be still? - Yes. - Okay. - Thank you. Finished. Great. How much do I owe you? This one's on me. I can't take- - Listen, you have to. It's not necessary. I can pay you. I've done suits for you for every special occasion. Baptisms. Birthdays. Graduations. Every one. It's true. And now you say this is... This is our last. So, this is me saying thank you. Okay. Thank you. Okay. You wanna do something for me? Yeah. Anything. Anything? Then can you tell me what's really going on? And I mean really. I can't. Well, then can you at least let me help you with whatever it is that you're not tellin' me? I can help you. I can be very resourceful. I know. I know. Okay. Can you at least do me one favor? Just one. Ease up off the weights a little bit. Any more muscular and you're gonna be tearin' through my double-stitched sleeves and I can't be havin' that. I understand. You always say that. Yeah. I know. I'll be back in an hour. - Make it two. - "Make it two." All right. Yeah, right. - Hey. - Hey. - Where are you? - Taking care of some things. Yeah, well, you said you were gonna be home early. I know, I know. It was important. Uh-huh. Well, it's always something. Well, can you at least tell me when you're gonna be home? - Why? - Well, hello! You know you're supposed to tell me everything. - You funny. - Uh-huh. No, seriously. I'll be there soon. I promise. Lock up, you hear me? Okay, well... - You gonna be okay? - No, no. Yeah, I'll be fine. I'll be there soon. I promise. Really? Promise. I'll be there real soon. Mm-hm. Okay. Well, you've got 30 minutes. - You serious? - Yes, I'm serious. 30 minutes. If you're not home in 30 you are going to be in big trouble. Like that, huh? Yeah. Don't forget. Lock up and turn on the alarm. Yeah. Well, love you. Bye. Almost. Sylvandale. What a surprise. Overrated, in so many ways. Rough. Unpolished. Deceiving, on so many levels. Only a fool would fall for its false promises. Where's Ellis? I don't know. Listen. I'm gonna tell you how this is gonna go. I'm gonna get what I want from you, and then I'm gonna kill you. The only question is, what happens between now and then. You tell me what I wanna know, and I can be kind. You don't... Well, let's just say what I have planned for you, you're gonna be begging me to kill you. I'm waiting. Please. Don't. You're gonna make this a lot of fun for me. Take off your clothes. Take off your clothes! What a waste. Used to always say this is where you come to clear your mind. I knew I'd find you here. The ol' mountains. My condolences. I know how much you loved her. And I told you, I told you when you married her, they wouldn't like it. I know you're mad. You want revenge. You think you know who did it. Probably calculating on how you can hit 'em back. But it'd be a big mistake. They're waitin' on you to slip up so they can kill you where you stand. Just some friendly advice. Yeah, but we ain't friends, are we? Never intended on us to be. Kristof wants to meet. Hey, handsome. Bad day? The worst. Well... Is there anything I can do to make it better? I can think of a few things. Oh. Like what? I love you. And it feels so good. Hi, beautiful. Hi. Why me? How big? I am in. You were the head of a government assassination team. There's only one way out. Death. One day you're not gonna make it. Are you fucking kidding me? Like seriously, I almost died. I'm never doing this again for you. Never. Here. I literally passed out. - It's him. - Are you sure? Look at him. His face was the last thing I saw while he was choking me, when I passed out. That shack, it was in the middle of nowhere. Literally, spiderwebs, freaking cobwebs everywhere, and broken glass. Reach into the glove compartment, with your left hand. Go up to the corner. You feel that? Mm-hm. Pull it out. How much is this? I don't know. What are you trying to do? Buy my silence? Pay me to keep quiet for... A measly... Oh, fuck. 30 grand? 'Cause if you are, mm-mm, you're damn right. You still couch surfing? No. I got myself my own place. It's nothin' great, but it keeps me warm. What's that? It's a key. You don't want it? To your house. It's my house, but it's your house now. Thank you. One stipulation. You need to get off the streets and live in it. You can't sell it. You can't rent it out. Thank you. You're welcome. Um... Sparkle? It's Tiffany. Tiffany. Take care of yourself. I will. Yeah. I need you to pick somebody up for me. Yeah. I know where he is. Take a walk. No, no! You shut your mouth, son. The king is here. Shovel. In the trunk. Horse tranquilizer. Sure to bring down an elephant. Enters the bloodstream quickly. Shuts off all motor function. Paralyzes everything from his toes to his head. Give him two. I have some new information I am sure you're going to want. What an interesting guy you are. Julia. Honey? Julia? Oh, shit. Julia. Baby? Baby? Somebody, help! Everyone has a purpose. As I think back on things, it's clear to me now what mine is. For the first time in my life, I feel alive. Hey, handsome. What took you so long? I've missed you. The Japanese call it takotsubo syndrome. When stressful events cause the heart to balloon and distort causing it to look like a traditional fishing trap. Like an octopus pot. In other words, when loving someone so much means there's no living without them.
