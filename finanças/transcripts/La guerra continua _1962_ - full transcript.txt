MAN: In this month of September, 1943, Italy is in a state of chaos. The country is being torn by the butchery of war. As the relentless allied armies pushed the retreating Germans, north. The morale of the Italian forces and of Italy herself is at its lowest ebb. Years of false promises have burst the great balloon of Mussolini's feverish leadership and have left behind battered cynical people. Military prisons such as this one are filled with a disillusioned horde of officers and men. Men who had once been proud of the service and the country they served now taste the bitterness of the defeat. Open up! Based on actual incidents, our story begins a few hours before Italy's unconditional surrender to the allies. The Germans are yet to be ready. As warden of this prison, it is my duty to screen all new prisoners. An American has been brought to me, caught behind the lines in civilian clothes. What was he doing so near German troop concentrations? Where was his secret base of operations? What was his mission? When you get through admiring them, I'd like to put them on. I'm modest. Thanks. It all happens to be true. You see, I didn't have any time to go shopping. Found the shoes on the suit in a pile of rubble. I swiped the shirt off a clothes line. - Like I told you, I was in, kind of, a hurry. - Why? You got it all written down there. I know that but I'm delighted with the way you were telling it. I've gone through it twice already. I didn't leave anything out. Anything important, that is. The second time you told it, you used exactly the same words, the same intonations that you used the first time. A well rehearsed lie, wasn't it? All right. Let's begin again. Well? What have I got to gain by lying to you? I fought in Africa and all the way across Sicily and it was lousy. You ever done any soldiering yourself... ...it's hot, there are bugs and mosquitoes. No booze, no dames and no food. What interests me is this... I want to know what you were doing at the Giuliano Bridge. Well, speak up! Tomorrow you will be driven to Rome, where you will be subjected to intensive questioning by the joint Italo-German intelligence bureau. Thanks. Put him in a cell and see that the man is given something decent to eat. He must be hungry. Just a moment... I'll keep those, if you don't mind. This is your last chance to say where you've hidden your uniform and equipment. Sorry. So am I. Crook. What do you think, you're feeding a bunch of pigmies? You're supposed to be feeding soldiers. Wait a minute, Sergeant. Who is calling who a crook? There is a difference between a crook and an artist. You know, I could find pots to wash for a man of your talent, Sergeant Marzi. You know what a man of my talent should be? Quartermaster for the Americans. Come on, move, before you have the Americans make you a Field General. All I want is Quartermaster. You'd have cleaned them out of supplies in two days, eh, Sergeant? [BELLS TOLLING IN DISTANCE] What is it? - What's going on? - I don't know... [INDISTINCT CHATTER] What is it? A revolution or something? All right! Everybody back to you cells. Meal's over. Come on, come on! Back to you cells! All right! Let's go! Let's go! What's going on here, anyway? They usually give us half an hour. I'll tell you what's going on. The filthy war is over. Come on, let's get out of here! Get back! Back to your cells! It's an order. Come on, get back! Get back! Hey! Conti, where are the others? Come on! Come on! Let's head for the docks. The docks! Are you out of your mind? They'll spot us in second. We have to get behind their lines, over the mountains. The Americans are in Naples. All we have to do is take a train there. The war is over. We'll never get through. We're all in the uniform. The first thing to do is get civilian clothes. Give it to the old Sarge. [LAUGHS] [MEN YELLING IN DISTANCE] The armistice, at last. I knew the American was lying. That he had his uniform and his equipment hidden somewhere and it was almost a pleasure to set him free to complete his mission. Hey! Anybody home? Wait! Senora! What are you afraid of? Open the door. You asked for it... I'm now going to count to ten and if you don't open the door, I'll blast it open. All right! Here we go. Now, open the door, one. Open the door, two. Open the door, three. Open the door, four. Open the door, five. Open the door, six. Open the door... [LAUGHS] Thank you very much. I was just passing by and I said to myself, "Why don't I go see the teller". I bet you'd be interested in a big bargain. You see that cannon? Well, I'll sell it to you with a two year guarantee. What do we need with a cannon? What's a home without a cannon? You better buy the thing. What do you want to sell it to us for? Why don't you sell it to a junk dealer? There's one right down the street. I tell you what. You resell it to him and you make a profit. - What about it? - No. It was stolen. You watch that. You're insulting the 3rd Division. They gave us each, one, to take home. - Well, 500 Lira. - No. Double that. Let's make it 750. These are hard times. Well, 750 but you'll have to throw in four used suits, all right? All right. Wait a minute. WOMAN: Soldiers selling their cannons. What next? Good thing for us, you aren't in the tank. - That's fine. - Here. It was a pleasure. Have a nice time with the cannon. Bye! I told you not to open the door. Well, at least I got rid of him. Yeah. You got rid of good money and four outfits. Now, how are you going to get rid of this. I wonder if she still has the same girls. Forward, men. To the attack. You haven't forgotten how, have you? Well, so long, I'll see you later. Come on, Conti. Where do you think you're going? To the station. Conti, my boy, come on, the old Sarge will pick out a girl for you, himself. You'll have a better time than at the station. I promise you. - No. I'm going... - You have to get rid of the uniform, remember? What's the matter? Don't you know a good thing when you see it? We have to get out of our uniforms, right? Well, let's do it in good company. Come on, you listen to the old soldier. Yeah. All I want to do is eat. Boy, a plate of spaghetti. Don't worry about that. Spaghetti, a chicken and all the women you want. Here we are. Column, right, two, three. No. I'm not going in there. Come on, you're a big boy, now, aren't you? - But I have Maria. - No. You and your Maria. Come on, get in there. Hey! How long have you been in the army? He gave you an order, didn't he? You better do what he says. He's an officer. Come on. How was I supposed to know the girls were gone. Germans! There are Germans all over, on the coast and all over the hills. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I'll go see what train that is. Tell me something. What train is that coming in? - Coming in? - Yeah. Well, it's bound for Naples but I don't know if it'll get there. Why is that? These days some of them make it and some of them don't. - Thanks. - Good luck. [TRAIN HORN HOOTING] [BRAKES SCREECHING] [CROWD CLAMOURING] Get up. Come on. Go slowly. All aboard for Naples! Hey, Libero! Libero! Sansone, come on. Pull me up. A man fell over. Pull the chord. Stop the train. No, it's his tough luck out there. Well, a man fell over, not a piece of meat. Get a hold of yourself. Don't be stupid. What if there's Germans out there? Go sit down and shut up! Get out of my way, you fat crook. Cut it out or I'll break your head. I know what you are. Look at him. Did you ever see a coward before? - Come on, sit down already. - Officer in yellowbelly. If you wanted to play the hero, why didn't you do it in the front? Hey! Better to be a crook than a coward, any day. It's over. Hey, hero, you're manly if you pull the chord. Shut up! You, too. Pull the chord. I'll pin a medal on you. Sit down. Come on. I won't forget. What difference does it make, anyway? He was right, so were you. "Coward." He called me a coward. - He got sore, that's all. - Swine. That train ought to be along this stretch any minute now, that farmer said. Smelled like a stable. Why did we ever have to leave Santa Clara, anyway? There's probably not much left of it, right now. I'd give anything to be in a nice American hill town, right now. Maybe the trains aren't running at all, anymore. They probably won't stop for us, anyhow. What a bunch of optimists, you are. - The train's coming and it'll stop. - Oh, sure. [TRAIN HORN HOOTING IN DISTANCE] - WOMAN: It's the train! - WOMAN 2: I told you it would. Stop! I'll show you how to stop a train. Hurry up! [ALL YELLING] Hold your skirt up! Stop! Hey, stop! [ALL LAUGHING] Believe me, are we glad to see you. Margarita, why don't you get up there and keep the nice man company? Keep him company? I'll marry him. Oh, you're so strong. Hey, you girls must have known I was on this train. Yeah, we always read the society column. Everywhere I go, it's like that. Sometimes it gets so bad, I have to beat women up with a club. I'd carry a club around, too, if I had a face like yours. - Where are you going, honey? - Americans like to live and they got money. So I'm heading South, like you. Come on, give me a hand. MARZI: [CHUCKLES] Come to papa. Come on. [GIGGLES] Hey, careful. Coming through. Coming through. Oh! Hey, what do you think you're doing? Keep your hands to yourself. Haven't you ever seen a woman before? - Sure but it was a couple of years ago. - Watch it. Watch it. Come on. Come on. Out of the way. Where were you, in solitary? I'll tell you where I've been... I said, "Keep your hands to yourself". Understand? I'd give you a kiss for your birthday, all right? In the mean time, let's take it easy, relax. [CHUCKLES] What have I got into, here? Are you two all right? It just got a little warm in here, that's all. You should try opening a window. I think it's my birthday. How about that kiss? If I kiss you, I'd have to kiss them all. Hey, you! Are you at a trance or something, eh? The least you could do, is kiss the five of us who are prisoners of war. All right. - Who's first? - The Navy. MARZI: Wow! Don't worry. You'll be all right in a minute. Now, let's see. Who's next? I know. I know. Ah! - That one took my breath away. - That's what I call a kiss. You bend down and close your eyes. - Now, you. - Oh, no. Leave that one alone. He's taken vows of chastity, purity and fidelity. The boy's in love. He believes in all that garbage. - Really? - Yeah. - What's her name? - Maria. Well, too bad. What about you? You hooked, too? - No. - Oh, that's a relief, otherwise I wouldn't have had anything to do but jump off the train. - What's your name? - Italia. What? That's a good one, "Italia". Where did you ever get a name like that? Why? Don't you like it? I'm too patriotic. Am I patriotic? Viva Italia! Okay, Valentino, you don't think I'll let you get away with a kiss as long as that. I think I'll let you pay for my ticket. - Come on. - All right. I'll tell you a little secret. I'm flat broke. I certainly picked the live one. No money? Italia, my girl. The old Sarge saves the day. I am an Italian, a gorgeous Italian. Any woman would let me... Pay for her ticket. [BOTH CHUCKLING] You old tub of lard. There are some gorgeous men around here who would let the girl - get out and walk. Imagine that. - Yeah. Yeah. - Well, what's new? - Anytime. Oh, look at all those grapes. Oh, come on, let's stop for a minute and pick some up, please. I'm so hungry. Can you shut up for one minute? I always talk when I'm hungry. Oh, come on, it'll just take a minute. Watch your step. That's what my mother always used to say. Don't go away. - Come on, Sansone. - I'm coming. Hey, help me down! You're a pretty clever girl. Is that how you always pay for your ticket? Well, I'm broke, too, if you have to know. Hey! Who gave you the right to talk to me like that? Stop! Please! It's all we have in the world. - It's all we have in the work. - Don't take them all. Please stop it. Ruining everything. It's all we have in the world. Please tell them not to pick up. Please. That's all we have to make our living. Please. Please. Stop. Please. [GUN SHOTS] WOMAN: Run! They're scared. So long. Hey! - What's going on there? - Germans! There must be more Germans around. - Let's go! Hurry up! Come on! - Let's run! Send a message to the next station. Tell them what happened. They'll know what to do. [GUN SHOTS] Fix the Italians. Hello! Peeping Tom. Hello! Peeping Tom. This is Pinocchio. Over. [LAUGHS] I'm eating. Ever tried swallowing cheese and bacon, dry. It's Pinocchio, all right? Over. Here's the job. It's G-type construction. Get me three one-way tickets. 200 pounds of Limburger before milking time. Got that? Over! Yeah, they picked me up but I was saved by the bell. Tell the General I love him for that armistice. Over and out. I don't see anyone around here. It shouldn't be deserted like this. - What is it? - Something is up. Let's go out there, have a look. No. No. I smell a rat. Where's he going? Let's go with him. Well, aren't you going to help me down? Hey. - Sarge, what's up? - Let's go over and take the local command. - I'm gonna see what's going on. - All right. Hurry back. [ALL SCREAMING] Hurry! Hey! SOLDIER: Hey! [GUN SHOTS] Come. - Will we ever come to the end of this tunnel? - Would you rather go back? What if they're on the other end of it. Let's hope not. Come on! Run! Run! - I can't anymore. - Save your breath. Oh, not so fast. - Could we stop a little? - You can do it. Oh, no, I've got to rest a little bit. Come on, run. Alberto? Italia? Don't stop! Come on! Let's rest a little while longer. I can't run anymore. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Let's go. Alberto, you make me so mad. I think I'll freshen up a bit. Hey, that water looks great... [ITALIA HUMMING] [EXCLAIMS] American. American. Hey, look! American ration! Chicago. I made it. American. If you don't believe me, look at it. It's an American army ration can. They're here. They're here. - Where did it come from? - From upstream. What did you find? Where are you going? Will somebody tell me what's going on? Wait for me, at least. - Hurry up! - What do you think I'm doing? SOLDIER: Halt! What are you up to? Come back here. You're American, aren't you? - Are you really an American soldier? - Yeah. Where are all of you coming from, huh? You're American, all right. Thank god. We're not soldiers. Don't think that. We're civilians. Civilians. We have no weapons. No, no. We haven't any. You're alone? Where are all the others? Where are they? The other men? The other Americans? Where are they? I'll ask the questions. Wait a minute, American. We're no more at war. We're not enemies anymore. - Now, put down your gun. - Where are you coming from? We got away from the Germans through the tunnel. They attacked the train full of civilians. You got a cigarette? A woman might like your cigarette. Catch. What's the matter? Don't you like my cigarettes? No, I don't mean that. I don't feel like it, now. I don't feel like smoking. That's all. - Fascist? - No. Not anymore, huh? - What do you mean by that? - Oh, come on! Fascist. None of us ever were. Just look at us. There were no fascists in Italy. No cigarettes for Alberto. He's a fighting man. A hero! Give him a gun. Try him out. I'm looking for Italians who want guns. Germans. Oh, no. No! Oh! [LAUGHS] You... What the hell, kind of, a joke is that, anyway? You want to be shot? War's over for you, so you can laugh, huh? Right. The war is over for us. The war is all over for us. So you're going alone. And if you don't like to fight alone... ...go home. He doesn't mean that. We are for liberty and for America. And for American cigarettes. I'll show you where you can get a lot of cigarettes. Cigarettes and K rations and American dollars. Come on. Then you are not alone? - For Americans, let's go. Let's go! - You'll be safe with them. Finally, Americans. Hey! Hey, Sarge, maybe now is you big chance to become a millionaire. There you go. American cigarettes. That's all that's left of the guys who brought them in for you. Why don't you go out in that minefield and pick their pockets. Go ahead. I'm sure they couldn't care less. Go ahead. It's all yours. On your feet, you gutless American cowards. Bring all that stuff in here! On the double! We're going to hear for these poor, fascist heroes. So wait. Just wait. They'll bring it in for you. All these men, young and strong. No more. For two years I've seen nothing but death. What now? Are you satisfied, huh? Bunch of idiots. Go on. Go on out there. And Sarge, go out and get your cigarettes. Why don't you go, too? So I could prove I'm not a coward? I don't have to. Captain, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going... I'm going to get the cigarettes and the dollars. Everything! You like guns. Why don't you go out and get some? Come on, Officer. Let's see what you're really made of. - You out of your mind? - Sure, who isn't, in this lousy world? I'd do anything. I'd even go out there to show him up for what he is. The odds are on my side. You know who always gets it, don't you? Yellowbellies like this one. Well? Go ahead. What are you waiting for? You know... ...you could get a gun out there, to protect me. Well, come on. I'm waiting for you, yellow... Alberto? Stop! What are you doing? You're not going to throw your life away for a tramp of a woman like that, are you? That's right. You're a tramp and the only reason he's doing this is for you! You think? Hey, Officer! Now is your chance to show us how brave you are. Come on out. I'll follow you, all right? Don't do it. Alberto? You're out of your mind. Alberto? Well, well, well... Relax. Sansone! Hurry up! Do something! Do something! Stop them! - He's really going to do it. - That's right. Come back! Alberto? Come back! The whole field is mined. You don't have a chance out there! Come back! Alberto? I don't want you to die, you stupid idiot. I don't want you to be killed like that. Alberto, I can't stand it anymore. Nuts! Absolutely nuts! Hey, American, can't you do something? Please. Come back. Both of you! Come back. Both... Must be out of their minds. Alberto? Please. Both, mad. Mad! They're mad, I tell you. They're mad! I'm going home. I'm going to Maria. I'm going home. I'm going home. Stop standing up on your feet. Down, on your hands and knees. All right, you're a hero. What am I supposed to do if you die? Well, I don't care if neither of you come back. Push the gun out in front of you. Push it out. Down. Stay down. It's crazy. Crazy, Italians. Italia. Italia. What's the matter? Can't you get up? Here, I'll help you. There, you both made it. Italia, this is pure silk. - Really? Will you give me some? - Why not? Sure I will. Then, make yourself some underwear. - You can model it for me. - Yeah, sure. [BOTH LAUGHING] Guns... Just what we need, more guns, to make a better world, filled with more, and better corpses. They landed near here, paratroopers. Anybody seen them? We've seen no American soldiers around here. Not a one. No. No soldiers. Who can tell if they're telling the truth? Anyone hiding the enemy will be shot. I swear on the Madonna. We did not see any American soldiers. - Go on, Sarge. - I got fat since I've been in the army. Too much easy living. Anybody home? Hello? - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - What do you want? - Is your husband home? - We're alone. Who are you? - We're Italian soldiers. - Soldiers? Who's that? Oh, he's a soldier, too. - But he's not Italian. - Well, he's still a soldier. Don't worry about him. He's American. No. Don't worry. You know, we're very hungry. - Do you have anything to eat? - We have nothing to eat. The Germans were here for a month. They took everything. Chicken. Sheep. Everything. Everything. How about it, Sansone. - But come in. Come in. I still have some potatoes. - Thank you, Senora. Maybe, you'd like a glass of wine. Wine? That's more like it. - Aren't you going to bed? - No. That wine went right to my head. I think I better turn in. Goodnight. Sansone... You're gonna dream of the farmer's daughter. [LAUGHS] - It's warm in there. Out here, there's a breeze. - Yeah. - American? - Yeah? - You got something up your sleeve, don't you? - Why? I saw you talking on the road with Alberto. I'm in love with the idiot. I don't want anything to happen. - Is that right? - Yeah. Really. American, you know what kind of a man he is? - No. - He's a dreamer. He'd be better off with the sergeant. You don't understand me. He's not your sort of soldier. The war's over for him. Come on, you think I'm fooling. I'm serious. I'm serious, too. What do you mean by that? I'm out here, speaking to a brick wall. What is it? You're... you're angry with me? No. You're fine. You're very friendly. Everybody likes you. Now, what's all this talk with Alberto? What are you two up to? Come on, am I that hard to talk to? I'm married. American, you don't really believe that. No. Italians are very jealous. You won't take Alberto. Hmm? Promise me, you won't take him. Sorry... ...but no thanks. Well, it's been a great conversation. All I want to do is keep Alberto from getting hurt. If that's the way you feel about it, drop dead. What have you been up to? Where have you been? None of your business! I like America, all right? What difference does it make to you? Leave me alone. Undestand? Leave me alone! - What are you looking at? - Family argument? Oh, give me a cigarette, will you? I need one. Here. Good for your nerves. I feel like kicking myself. What am I trying to do? Sure, women like me are stupid. I go and fall in love with Alberto. I'm just a sort of girl he'd like to take home to his mother. - Why not? - Like hell, he would. I wish that... Things had been different. Well, it's too late for that. The war spoiled everything. I wish I had known him before the war. Why am I sitting here, talking like a dumb idiot? Go on, talk. It's funny... Out of all the men in the world, I have to pick that maniac. The one with the noble ideas. Nothing wrong with me, all right. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. JACK: They should have landed here on hill 483. The wind blew them over the hill tops and into that minefield. How about over here... ...about 8 miles north of the Garigliano River? Over here... Is the bridge? And that's my first job. Blow it up and help slow down the German drive against the Salerno beach head. But I can't do it alone. Just a second... - ...There are two of us. - Thanks but we're going to need at least four men. What about your friends? That fat guy has got a lot of guts. Marzi? He's the only one. The Sarge will do anything for money but the others... You have money? Yeah, they gave me plenty. I guess they figured I'd need it. What about the other one, the little one? What's his name? - Libero? - Yeah. - The sailor? - Why? He's against everything and everyone. And Sansone is not smart enough for a job like this. Marzi's the only one. - But for money. - Yeah. This bridge job is urgent, but once we get it out of the way, we start on the most important part of the mission, to organize civilian resistance, guerrilla warfare. There must be plenty who'll join us once we make our first move, eh? Yes, there'll be many. Hundreds. Thousands of them. I'm sure of it. Why won't you tell me what's going on, Alberto? - What do you mean? - I'm no fool, Alberto. - I have a feeling that something is wrong. - Yeah? - What? - What, what? What are you and the American going to do? Well, something we have to do to save face, I guess. There's nothing to worry about. Alberto, come here. Sit down. I wish you would tell me what it is. Better if you don't know. I worry about you. I don't worry about you. You'll get along, all right. You don't know how wrong you are. I fell in love with you when I first saw you on the train but I was afraid of it. So was I. Before, I was cursing the war but it's the war that brought us together. There's some good to it after all. Oh, I love you so much. Hey, you're crying? That's right. I'm not as bad as you think, you know? I know and I love you. Marzi... Circle around. Alberto? Hand me the explosives. Help Marzi down. Hey! Hey, you! [GUN SHOTS] Stupid fool. I could kill myself. It's not your fault. Why worry? Ah! Sure, it was my fault. I should have stayed in prison, out of people's way. Wait a minute. I thought I heard them. Don't take it so hard. Marzi? Get the mule! You, wake up all of the others. The old lady and her daughter are going with us. I said, "Get the mule"! What's the rush? The bridge blew up, didn't it? Yeah. But not hard enough to earn any medal. The German army has got two less soldiers and as soon as they know, they're not going to be happy about that. Boy... ...they got enough left to tear up this whole country side. So we're heading South. I can get you to the allied lines. You'll be safe there, all of you. That's what you've been waiting for, isn't it? Now, get going! I was afraid. If you knew you couldn't make it, you should have backed out. And you have the nerve to call me a coward. - I'm sorry. - No. Forget it. I thought it would end up a lot worse than it did. Who are all those people? They're from up the mountain. From Altano. Wait a minute. Wasn't Conti from Altano? That's right, and so was his girl, Maria. What happened? The German. The Germans! They've ruined the village. They killed our son. They were looking for Americans but they weren't there. Oh, what'll happen to us? Germans said they were sure we were hiding Americans and we kept saying "no, no, there aren't any" but the Germans broke into our homes and took ten of our young men. Curse the Germans. German pigs. If we don't do something about those Germans, nobody else will. Papa, no. - You're from Altano? - Yes, Altano. Altano. Our poor village. Our poor sons. Do you know anyone there, by the name Conti? - WOMAN: Conti? - Yes. WOMAN: Oh, poor boy. They hanged him. And he hadn't been home two days. Poor boy. Did you hear? Conti was hanged. So was my son. Can nothing stop the Germans? We can't go back to our village. We have nothing. And no one to help us. - Look! Who's that? - American. - An American? - An American? - Go away. - Go away. That way. - Go away. Go away. - Stop! Stop! Stop! - [ALL YELLING] - Stop! Stop! We're your friends. We want to help you. The Germans took ten of our young men. They said that if we didn't turn in the Americans by tonight, they would kill all of them. Ten young men? - How many Germans are there? - Not many. If you ask me, I'd say there were 10 or 15, on a whole maybe 25. Come on, we have enough guns and ammunition. Let's go up. Wait a minute. You don't have to come. You have your mission. This concerns only our people. We'll take care of it. Take it easy, pal. How many men can you get together, with guns? Eight or nine. We can get more. - Where are the Germans now? - In the village. They're in the town hall, across the piazza from the school. Alberto, we're in business, guerilla business. Look, you take your men and your guns and you post them just outside of town hall, on the far side. Tell them to stay under cover. When you hear a gun fire, you move in fast. We want to divide up the German firing power by hitting them from all sides. We'll do it! Wait a minute. I'll need one of you as a guide. - This one. - All right, you go with them. American, we'll do everything we can to help you. Okay, papa, we'll be waiting for you. Let's go. The hell with them all. Bunch of heroes. Automatic... [SPITS] Just pull the trigger. They make it so easy to kill a man. Save yourself, you jackass. Here's the ammunition. You won't leave me here. I want to go with you. No, you stay here, Italia. Alberto... You'll come back. I know you will. Cheer up. It won't take long. Wait here. - Oh, stupid... - Shut up. Go on. - What about you? - Shut up. I'm a sergeant. Go on. Sansone... Go on. Well, go on. - Which way to the piazza? - You can go either way. You three go that way. Come on. Don't shoot. He's my brother. Come here. I saw you coming. Can I help you, American? Hostages still locked up? Yes, they are and I saw only one German guard at the piazza. - The Germans, where are they? - In the town hall. Thank you. No! You two stay here. Conti. Sarge? Here. [SHOUTING IN GERMAN] [MAN SCREAMS] It's the Sarge. Is it bad? Huh? Don't worry about me. Fire. Else you can go on without me. German car! Alberto! [MAN SCREAMS] [BOTH GRUNTING] Come on. Hurry up! Get out! Put the Germans in the town hall. Does it hurt? Yeah. Alberto? Alberto. Why? No! No! The Germans are not going to like what happened here today, American. Yeah. Nobody can stay here anymore. Anyone who wants to come into the hills with me is welcome. You have one hour to pack up anything you can carry. Food and medicines come first. I'll go with you, American. - So will I. - Me, too. Me, too.
