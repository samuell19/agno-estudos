(MultiCom Jingle) - [Voiceover] I really didn't believe in haunted castles. And I definitely not believe in ghosts. But that was before I knew about Castle Climenco. (spooky organ music) (cork popping) But I better slow down. I'm getting ahead of myself. (triumphant adventurous music) In the daytime, haunted castles don't look haunted. Look at it, it looks harmless enough. Legend has it, that the Climenco family ruled the entire land for over 500 years. This was their home. Legend also has it, that they would always rule the castle, even from the grave. My mom said I'd love living in a huge old castle. I had to admit, I had my doubts. (triumphant adventurous music) (jet engines roar and tires skid) The bad news was, I was landing in Sylvania. The good news was, I had a round trip ticket. - [Voiceover] Sylvania Air, Flight 1170 now arriving from Los Angeles at Gate Four. Sylvania Air, Flight one, one, two, now arriving from Los Angeles at Gate Four. That's me, not the Wiener dog, the cute little guy with the backpack. I'm the one everyone seems to be bumping into. - [Voiceover] This one's for the brown leather bag there. Yes. - [Voiceover] Sylvania Air Flight Two, Four, Oh, now departing for Rome - Atchoo! - Bless you! - Bless you! - Thank you. - Can anyone see a porter? - There's no need, hun, it's only a few bags. - Kevin, are you all right? Give one of those to Tony, please. - That's okay, I got it. - Christine, he's fine. Tell your mother you're fine. - I'm fine. - [Voiceover] How could I be all right? No friends, no fast food, no fun. - Kevin, I really want you and Tony to get along. I want this to work out. - I liked it when it was just the two of us. - Hun, life just doesn't work that way. - She's right, Kev, some day soon maybe we'll be a family. - [Voiceover] That was my biggest nightmare. - Now, Chrissy, any statements to the press, keep them short, just like we rehearsed. Here's a pen for the autographs. - Oh Tony, my series Money and Power's been off television for two years. I really doubt if anyone half way across the world remembers. - (laughs) You're so cute. - (laughs) - Oh, Chrissy, there she is! Can I have your autograph, Chrissy? - God bless the Power of Television! (press crowd shouts excitedly) - Well, I just want to thank the Sylvivianites... the Sylvivians? The people of Sylvania! (laughter) And I need you to announce that I invite you all to the Castle Climenco for the Grand Opening of the greatest health resort Europe has ever seen! Spa Christine! Tah-tah! - Let's go, we'll see you all there! - Excuse me, excuse me... - [Voiceover] When Mom's fans are around, she forgets about everything, including me. - Sylvania loves me. - Adores you. - Do you really think so? - Absolutely, Darlin'. - Gosh, and I've missed the cameras. Oh my gosh, do I have lipstick on my teeth? - Nope. - Ah, thanks, Baby. - Kevin, we are going to have such a great summer. You and me and Tony together, gonna have a great time. - I wanna go home. - Oh boys, we're in Sylvania, let's have some fun. - [Voiceover] Fun would be life without Tony. - Mm, that feels delightful. - Who loves you, Babe? (chuckles) Who do you love, huh, who do you love? - Oh Tony. (laughter) - This is it, Castle Climenco! - Spa Christine! - Atchoo! - Bless you! - Pavel, I'd like you to meet your new bosses. This is Joanne, Christine's personal secretary. - And spiritual advisor. - Nice to meet you, Joanne. - Oh, I knew you were gonna say that. - And this is Kevin. And this is, of course, the beautiful Christine. Everyone, this is Pavel. The Head Butler here. We need it, he gets it. - Caretaker and Chief Coodinator, actually. The servants will take your luggage. Please... - Actually, this is the first time we rented the castle in quite a few years. - Well, the rental agreements look to be A-O-K. - Just as we discussed. - And Chrissy, you know it takes money to make money. - Yes it does. All seems to be in order. - So what do you say we make it official? (ghostly breeze blows) - Hah! (creepy music) - What on earth...? - Sign on the dotted line, Babe. Ha, that's my girl. - Excuse me, Miss Forest, the Sylvanian National Press has arrived. - Well, time for your photo shoot. I'll wrap up all this boring paper stuff myself, and you go knock 'em dead with that gorgeous smile. - Mom? Mom, can I talk to you? - Kevin, can it wait a little bit? I'm running late. - Okay. - It's been a pleasure doing business with you, Baron. - And with you. - [Voiceover] Maybe I was only 12, but this didn't look right to me. - Now if there's anything more I can do for you, please don't hesitate to ask. - Yeah, it's been a rich experience. - Mm, indeed. - See you, Baron. - Good day. (creepy music) - Kevin... Kevin... (playfully creepy music) - Ugh! Ugh! - Well, I'm not much of a surgeon but I think you will walk again. You might feel a trifle of a sting. - Nah... A little, yes. Sorry for running through your garden. - Stop apologizing. Your Mom signed the lease, it's your garden now as well. - Okay. - Now, shall we try out your leg? - [Voiceover] Pavel seemed pretty cool, for an adult. - Kings and queens and knights from all over the world dined in this very room. - Cool! - Is that the lord of the castle? - Yes, Lord Climenco. He died with honor, protecting his castle and his family. Honor was the most important thing a Climenco could have. - Nice hair. (chuckles) Hey, that's the girl who stole my hat! - What? - The girl I chased through the garden, that's her. This painting is of Lady Anastasia Climenco and her daughter Sofia. I doubt Sofia's done much running lately. She died over 300 years ago. (bubble gum pops) (ghostly laughter) (door creaks) (vacuum runs loudly) - Hi, could you finish up later? 'Cos I'm gonna hit the sack. You know, sleep? - Yes, Sir. (crickets chirp) (both scream) - Stay back! Or I'll, or I'll, I'll vacuum you. (gasps) Back, back! (laughter) - Careful, I wish to scare you, not kill you. - You didn't scare me, I tripped. - Do you know who I am? - I saw your picture. - I am Sofia Climenco, the protector of the castle. My powers are greater than you could possibly comprehend. - Like stealing hats, big whoop! - [Voiceover] Shouldn't have said that. - I can call on hurricanes, with a snap of my fingers. Burn bridges with the blink of an eye. Rattle houses with a shake of my fist. - Don't mess with me. Taking karate this fall. - Karate? - Yeah, where you break slabs of ice with your head and stuff. - You can't do that. - Well, you can't summons hurricanes. - Yes I can. It's just I don't want to. Do not test me, foolish one. I am all powerful. - That's pretty good, what else you got? - Listen to me! I'm not here to amuse you. You must leave at once. - I told you, you don't scare me. - Why not? I'm a ghost. - Yeah, you're a little ghost. - Little ghost? You have been warned. - [Voiceover] That girl wasn't kidding around. But she was cute. (birds chirp and dogs bark) - Left, left right left. Come on, Guys, follow in, left, left, left right left. Come on, come on, fall in, get in line! Suck in those guts, stick out those chests! All right, I don't know how Pavel's been running things around here, but I'm here now. And with the team composed of you and me, we can do the impossible. We will modernize, we will conquer, but with me as your leader, and you as my workers, we can make this the greatest spa on earth! - What is this crazy man saying? - Just nod and smile. He will go away. - All right! Out with the old and in with the new. What do you say, fellas? Let's get to work, come on, come on, come on! Let's go! (grunting and groaning) ♫ I don't know what you've been told (pneumatic drill hammers) ♫ But Spa Christine is gonna be gold ♫ Come on fellas, dig, dig, dig, dig! - Oh, I predict you're going to love this present! - Happy Birthday, Kevin. - Mom, I already have a pair of roller blades. - Well, now you have two. - [Voiceover] Dork! - Good afternoon. - Ah, they're beautiful, Pavel. - Thank you. - Mom, I need to talk to you, alone. - Hun, you need to get ready for the fashion shoot for the brochure. - Five minutes, we're almost done here. - No, no, Christine, the little voice in my head says you should go now, and the little voice, he's hardly ever wrong. - [Voiceover] Joanne was always talking crazy. It drove me nuts. - Joanne knows what she's talking about. So put on that happy face, go on over and put on those aerobics outfits and zip! You're back in a flash. - Kev, can we finish this up later? - Sure, I understand. - [Voiceover] Before Tony, birthdays didn't suck. - Some cake? - No, thank you. I'm not hungry. - Kevin, Happy Birthday. - Thanks! It's really neat. - One day I'll show you how it works. See that clearing? That's where we will have a sword fight. - Really, you think I could? - Of course, this was Lord Climenco's sword. - En garde! (ghostly laughter) - Sofia? Sofia... (door creaks) (footsteps echo and water drips) - [Voiceover] Creepy. This place was definitely creepy. (bat flaps and squeaks) (gasps) (mysterious organ music) - Ah! - [Voiceover] She got me again. (slab crashes to ground) - (laughs) I frightened you. - Okay, okay, I admit it, you got me. Now get me out of here. - But you might aim another appliance at me. - Can you please help? - Me, help you? But I'm just a little itty, bitty ghost. How can I possibly be of any assistance to a big, strong, living commoner like yourself? - Hey, who are you calling common? - You! You and your castle-invading family. - I don't even want your castle. You can have it back. It's what I wanted to tell you. Thanks. - If you wanna talk, I'll be in the garden. - [Voiceover] I always had a way with girls. I want to make you a deal. - Yes? - I'll help you get your castle back if you help me get Tony away from my Mom. He's a sleazy creep and I need to prove it to her. - You are suggesting that I assist you, and you will assist me? - Yeah, like partners. - I agree. - Okay, I guess we should high-five or something? - High-five? - Yeah, stick your hand up in the air and slap mine. - Why on earth would we do that? - It's what kids do, trust me. - I fail to see the joy in that. - We'll work on that. (laughs) - [Voiceover] Who would have thought my new best friend would be a ghost? - All right, bring that around, Guys. Hold it! This isn't gonna work. - Thank God, he's coming to his senses. We have to lose that old pot to make this thing fit. - That pot is from the 14th Century. - Let's go, Fellas, move the pot. Come on, faster, Fellas! (clapping) (straining and groaning) - It won't budge. - Wonderful. - Okay, smash it. - I can't believe this. - Smash it? - Yeah, smash it. Good work, guys. All right, everybody gather round, grab your shovels 'cos you're going to rip up the garden! - Dig? Dig, speak English? Hah! This entire garden's got to go. - What is this? - Dig it up. Oh hey Pavel, can you translate for me? - Are you out of your mind? This is a prized garden. - Yeah well it's on top of my parking lot, pal. Didn't you see the revised plans? All right everybody. Let's go, dig up the garden. - I can't look. - Let's go, let's go! Work with me! - Sofia? Oh, great. - Oh! (laughs nervously) Men! Pashi? Klug? And Danka, subdue the hose. Oh, oh, oh! Subdue the hose! (exclaims fearfully) - Go, Girl! (cries out in fear) - Do you like Sylvania? - Yes, I do. The people, especially. They're so kind. And the Castle Climenco, do you enjoy living here? - Would you excuse me for just a moment? Tony? - No, help me, please... - Are you okay? - Ahhhhhhh! - Got it! (laughter) - Any more questions? - Just some more photos, please. (gentle piano music) (bubbling) - Oh dear. - Atchoo! I have your check, please make sure you fill out your time sheet on the first day of each week. I'm getting a vision... I see you and you are working for a wonderful woman whose future is fabulous. Your life is a little dull. Don't blame me. I call it like I see it. (bell pings) (thunder clap) Great, rain. (raindrops hitting stone) - What? (panicked squealing) - What is it? - Rain, inside. Following me. - You're shaking like a leaf. - Rain followed me. - It's just a busted drain pipe, that's all. - This place is haunted. And you don't need a crystal ball to see that. - Just relax. - Relax? How, we are being invaded by evil spirits who are capable of, Oh, you could be one of them! Quick, what's my name? - We're all just a little jumpy, that's all. - Just answer the question! - Joanne, stop it! Just, stop it. Trust me, who do you love? (kisses) - Atchoo! (throat clearing) - Kevin! Thank God you're here. Joanne is soaked and shivering, come hold her. - [Voiceover] I'd be shivering too, if he were holding me. - Oh, yeah, that'll work too. - Busted, drainpipe. - Uhuh, sure. Joanne, Mom's looking for you. She's in her room. - Oh, okay, thanks. (door creaks) (water drips echo) - Sofia! You were great! I mean, that was you, wasn't it? - It was me. - I bet Tony's still in his room, soaked to the bone. - That's what worries me, Kevin, he's still in his room. He hasn't fled. - I know. - I wish my mother were here. - Where is she, could she help? - She only comes once a year at the Harvest Moon. - You mean, you live here all by yourself? - Yes. - Well, just call her or do whatever you ghosts do to get in touch. - I can summon her only. - Great. - It is difficult. I have never done it before now. - Have you forgotten how? It was never thoroughly explained to me, you see, my mother despises being bothered. I thought I could handle my responsibility and I did not need her help. I wanted her to be proud of me. But it does not matter, Kevin. I've tried, I cannot do it. - Just try some more. - It is hopeless. - Sofia? - I am fine. (mournful choir) (birds chirp in garden) - Your turn. - You're kidding, right? - No, give it a go. - Pavel? - Yes? - How long have you lived at the castle? - All my life. This is my home. - That's a long time. I mean, not that you're old, it's just-- No, it is a long time. Don't give up, that's the key. You'll catch on. Good, now we'll have a little match. - I wish my Mom would change her mind on the spa idea. It's not right. - Well, have you made her aware of your feelings? - Nah, she's been too busy with the media and all. - She seems to care for you a great deal, Kevin, I'm sure she would listen. She's your mother, speak to her. - I've already tried that. - Maybe if you got somebody else to talk to her? - Hey, great idea. Thanks, Pavel. - [Voiceover] Adults can be so gullible. (livestock lowing and market goers chatter) - I'll take one. Thank you. Pavel! - Good morning! I didn't expect to see you here. - I needed a break from all the hoopla. It's a beautiful day, isn't it? - It certainly is. Christine, I would like to talk to you about Kevin. I don't think he's very happy here. - Go on, Pavel, tell her she can't go through with the spa idea, go on, tell her! - Uh oh... - Oh no, he's gonna ruin everything. - Hi hun, forgot your jacket. There's always something. (chuckles) Just glad it wasn't her skirt. - Well, thanks. Tony, Pavel is very concerned about Kevin not liking it here. - Chrissy, could you go buy us some peaches? I'd like to speak with Pavel. Please listen carefully, 'cos I don't want you to misunderstand me. Stay away from Kevin, stay away from Chrissy, your job is to merely keep up the castle. So if I catch you meddling in my affairs, I will fire you. That's all. (mischievous piano music) (tomatoes splattering) (laughter) (market people cheer and laugh) - [Voiceover] There she goes again, giving away my Mom's money. - For you, and you. Federov, stop cheating on your wife. Rulop, September is a good time to look up old friends. - [Voiceover] I never trusted Joanne, and I certainly didn't believe in her psychic crystal ball baloney. - There you are. There you go. For you. - Guys, guys, I just want to say, from the bottom of my heart, that the last few days you've really put forth a fantastic effort, we've accomplished a lot, but to remember that we have less than a week to make this undeniably the most unbelievable, fantastic, phenomenal experience the health club world will ever know. What is this crazy man saying? - Just nod and smile. He will go away. - Next up, the mud baths. - Killer hoses, tomato goo, this guy won't give up. - Okay, break time's over, back to work. - He's very determined. - And stupid. - Dangerous combination. I've got something to show you. - I'm reading. - Not for long. (laughs) - Sofia... - Kevin, we need to go to the far end of the castle. We're going to put those boots with wheels on the bottom of our feet. - Rollerblading? - Yes! - [Voiceover] The scary part wasn't that she was a ghost. The scary part was, that I was starting to like her. (laughter) - What are you doing? - I believe it's called having fun. - We're gonna kill ourselves on these. - But I'm already dead. - Well, I'm not and I'd kinda like to stay that way. - Indulge me. - Tony? - Oh no, it's my Mom. Disappear. - Joanne? Oh, Kevin, it's you. And you're using your roller blades. Both pairs? - Yeah, I rigged up that way, goes a lot faster. See ya. (laughs nervously) - I love these boots with wheels. Stop. After you... - Spooky! - The Castle Climenco has many secrets. In celebration of your birthday... - [Voiceover] A telescope, boy was I glad it wasn't another pair of roller blades. - I believe I cleaned out most of the cobwebs. - I love it, Sofia, thanks. - We can try it out tomorrow night. - Tomorrow night? What's wrong with tonight? Indulge me. (crickets chirping and owls hooting) (water laps at lake shore) (stick cracks) - Oh, this place is going to give me heart attack. (laughs) I suppose it was silly of me to take a walk outside by myself at night. - I will walk with you, if it makes you feel safer. It's a very good night to be under the stars. - Oh! This is so nice. - It's often the small things that are the most enjoyable. - In my world, I often forget that. - You're not alone. (night birds call) - It looks like the face of a man. A fairly unattractive man, but a man. Show me something else. - Let's see. Oh, here's Orion's Belt. - Ooh, look, look, look! - Relax, it's just a constellation. - Look. - Atchoo! - [Voiceover] I'd know that sneeze anywhere, it was her. (gasps) Come on! - What in the world are you doing? - I need to get up to the window and see something. - You wish to go for a closer peek? - Yes, give me a boost? - What is a boost? I do not think I have one. - A lift up there. - As you wish. - Thanks for the boost, I think. (blows curtains aside) Can't believe him. - What a filthy flagrant pig! (leaves rustle loudly) - It's nothing. Where were we? - Sofia? - Yes? - Help - Don't worry, I'm still giving you one of those boost things. - [Voiceover] They were a great pair, Sneezy and Sleazy. That lying, cheating, stealing... - Ugly. - Ugly, thank you. - You should tell your mother at once. - She wouldn't believe me. Sofia, do ghosts dream? - I have it every night. In it, I'm waltzing across a spectacular formal ballroom a long flowing dress, spin step turn, and then it happens. - What? - I wake up. I suppose I'm just a hopeless romantic. - That's it. - What is it? - That's how we get rid of Tony. We find my Mom a replacement. - A replacement who's charming, romantic, and earth-shatteringly gorgeous. - Let's see, there's... - Pavel! - Pavel! (horses neigh) - When... - What couldn't wait, Tony? - My love, it's time to ask you that question. (clears throat impatiently) - Pardon. - Chrissy, darling, my love of my life, will you-- - Excuse me, just need you to sign a few more checks while the spirits are calm. - You were saying? - Chrissy, will you... (lawnmower chugging) - Hi Mom, Pavel wanted me to give you this. He also asked if he could join us for dinner? I told him I'd have to ask you first. - Of course, it's fine with me if it's fine with him. - [Voiceover] Ah, the rose routine, one down, one to go. - It is fine with me if it is fine with her. - Great, then it's all set. Don't forget, 8 o'clock sharp. Um, I thought you might use these? - Blue jeans? No, I think not. - But I brought them just for you. - I have a closet full of my own dress clothes, thank you very much. (playful piano music) - Well, I hope you like the soup. The vegetables are fresh from the market, and the herbs are from Pavel's garden. - It's great, Mom. - Pavel, I notice the lines on your palm are very long and telling. - Thank you, I think. - May I touch one of your possessions? - Maybe after dinner? - More milk? - No, thank you. Mom, you should see Pavel with the sword, he could slay armies, and with a bow and arrow, he could hit a fly dead on from a hundred feet. - Well, a large fly, it's nothing really. - How useful! I have a very important announcement to make. Are those my jeans? - [Voiceover] Busted. - Tony, what is it? - I ask everyone to bear witness to this joyous occasion. (gurgling and spluttering) - Sir? - Thank you. (chuckles) Christine, this is what I want to show you. (comical circus-style music) (grunting and groaning) Christine, would you do me the honor of becoming my wife? - I will... - [Voiceover] My life is over. - Think about it. (slapping) - What is the matter with you? - I'm fine, just slapping myself to make sure that I'm not dreaming. - Indeed. - Thank you for dinner. I know you have a lot to think about, so I'll just leave you to your thoughts. - Yes, Tony... - He's not slapping himself anymore, is he? - I don't know what got into him. - I don't like what he's doing to the castle. This place has such a rich history, and he's killing it. - He's not killing anything, it's called modernization. - I guess the legend is wrong. - What legend? - It is said, that Madame Climenco vowed to protect this castle, even from her grave. - Do you think she's haunting this place? - That's what the legend says. - Oh, I see what you're doing. You're trying to scare me off to save the castle. - Well, I... - I like you, Pavel, but I see you more clearly now. And you are not going to ruin my dream. Guess who? - If it's Pavel, you're fired. (laughs) - Yes. - Yes, you'll marry me? - Yes, I'll marry you. - [Voiceover] One big happy family. (night birds calling) (door creaks) (bells tinkle) - Caramayonder, I call on you to appear. Rise to the heavens and awaken. I need you, Mother. What am I doing wrong? I'm saying the Ancestor's names. Throwing the earth towards the heavens. - Are you forgetting anything? - I do not think so. - Don't give up, this is too important. - The moat's already been filled, the side garden destroyed. - But it's not too late, the castle needs you. My mother needs you. - Kevin, it would take a miracle to summons my mother. - Then I'm asking for a miracle. I just can't let Tony get away with this. Have you tried jumbling the words in a different order? - I am a terrible protector. I wanted to show my mother I could do it on my own, but I can't, I need her. - Let's try, come on. Yondercaramay, I call on you to appear, rise to the heavens and awaken. (dramatic orchestral music) (deep rumbling) (comical music) (goat bleats) - I'm guessing that's not your mother. - It's hopeless. (wind blows) - Sofia, Sofia! - What's happening? - You're so cold. Here... You need to rest. You'll be okay. - Night. For some reason, I can't shake this uneasy feeling. I don't know what to believe any more. - I can solve this problem once and for all. - You can? - Absolutely. We'll just have Joanne do a seance. She'll contact the spirits, ask them if it's okay we're here. Will that give you some peace of mind? - Okay, we'll have the seance. - Oh, good. You get some sleep. - Pavel? - What are you doing here? - Nothing. - What do you want? - I want to speak to Pavel. - Well, you're a little late, big guy. - What are you talking about? - He's gone. - Pavel! - [Voiceover] Great, that's all we needed. Another pink marble statue of Mom. Pavel, is it true? He fired you? - Yeah, it's just as well. - You can't leave Castle Climenco. It's your home. - No, it's Spa Christine now. - He can't do this. I need you, for sword-fighting and stuff. - I'm sorry, I have to go. - I thought you said never to give up. - I'm gonna miss you, Kevin. - This is a seance, we need a magical mirror or something. - Tadah! Work with me, Babe. - I guess this will do. Yes, this will do. - Here's the plan. We start with a little table rattling, and we go to pictures crashing down off the walls to the grand finale, the Voice from Beyond. (chuckles) I welcome you to this house. Stay as long as you like. This is your home now. We're leaving, bye bye. - Hey, I thought that I would channel the spirit through me and have her speak through me. It's much more dramatic. - No channeling. It's much too complicated. - But Tony, I'm good. This is the Guard of the Castle. Please stay and make yourself at home. (chuckles) Not bad, huh? - Maybe next seance. - Sofia? Pavel's gone. It's just you and me now. - What's happening to me, Kevin? - You're dying. - But I'm already dead. - You're a Climenco, if the castle's destroyed, so are you. - Help me, Kevin. - I'm not going anywhere. You're my friend. I'm gonna save you and my Mom. - You're my friend. (mysterious dramatic music) - Please, take your seats. Please close your eyes. I call now upon she, whose name this castle bears. Raise the table to signal your presence, oh ghostly person. Rattle the paintings if you wish to speak to us mortal beings. Oh, she's ready. Oh, I feel her life force entering me. (moaning ecstatically) - You do? - I don't? No, no I don't. She wishes to talk for herself. She will speak. Yes, yes, what is your message to us? - How dare you enter this place, foul blasphemers? - What? - What? - Mortal scum, defilers of the Sacred Temple. Have I not warned you? - What is this? - Looking for this, big guy? Now leave at once, be gone or know my wrath! - Yes, yes, I'll be gone. (screams) - Chrissy! - I've got the gift. - [Voiceover] I began to think my plan was working. - Kevin, change of plans, we're leaving first thing in the morning. - Chrissy! Chrissy! Chrissy, you can't do this. Our Spa, we had a plan. - Did our plan include flying candles, indoor rainstorms, bionic bubble baths and possessed garden hoses? - Well, no, but we're business people. We roll with the punches. - That's crazy! Were you not in the room a few minutes ago? We're out of here. Hun, we don't have to leave. We'll have Joanne do an exorcism, she's very good at those. - Nope, we're leaving. - What about the Presidential Dinner? You can't stand up the President. - Yes, you're right. We'll use the dinner as a forum to announce our change of plans and our vow to preserve the castle. - [Voiceover] This was the moment of our victory, or so I thought. - You did it, Kevin. You saved me. Now that Spa Christine is done, and Tony can't steal any more money, I bet he won't be around too long. - Please accept my thanks. - I, you're welcome. - [Voiceover] My very first kiss, who cares if it was from a ghost? - There's gotta be a way. There's gotta be a way! (hits wall with fist) (stones grind on each other) - I wish you could come to the Presidential Dinner. Maybe I'll steal you a dessert or something. - I would like that. - Hey, big guy. - What do you want? - I think this belongs to you. - [Voiceover] Uh-oh. This is not good. - Must have dropped it in your secret tunnel. - Okay now, this is Kevin, testing. (clears throat) Now leave my castle at once, be gone or know my wrath! Now leave my castle! (clears throat) - What's going on? - There's your ghost. - Kevin, you tricked me. - I was just trying to help. We don't belong here. We're not wanted. It's important, you've gotta believe me. (tutting) - Who can believe you now? Oh, Chrissy, we'll deal with this later. It's just a phase. Come on, hun. We have a Spa to announce. - It's true. I'm not the fake, Tony is, Joanne is. - Oh, Kevin. - Kev, you're outta here. In a month, you'll be off to Military School for some much needed discipline. (telescope shatters) - Oops, sorry, big guy. - [Voiceover] I really didn't like that guy. - Hi... - Hi... You really like this tree. - I should. I planted it over 300 years ago. - Did you hear what happened? - Guess you won't be pocketing any dessert for me tonight. - Nope, I'm grounded. - But you're not in your room. - I don't care any more. Spa Christine officially opens tomorrow. No doubt about it, I'm gonna be shipped off to Military School. - Kevin, you did your best. - I wanna show you something, a surprise. - What is it? - Follow me. Just a little bit further. Do your thing. - I'm too tired. - That's okay, I got it. (sweet harp music) - Kevin, it's beautiful. - I did my best. I have the 16-piece orchestra (chuckles) And well, I'm not earth-shatteringly gorgeous, but I am a partner, sort of. Would you like to dance? - Yes. - Are you really up to this? - Definitely. (waltz music) This is just like my dream. (laughter) - Hey, I'm trying. - No, no, it's not you. - What's so funny? This is where I usually wake up. - You're still here. - I know. (thunderous gale) Sofia? - I'm okay, just very tired, Kevin. - Can I take you back? - In a minute, I just want to sit here a little bit longer. (melancholy waltz tune) (crickets chirping) (footsteps and door creaking) - Sleep tight, big fella. (moans quietly) (chamber music) (guests chatter excitedly) - Oh, Christine! Christine you look so beautiful! - And this is Spa Christine's own line of beauty products. We're very proud of them. Shall we? (mud baths bubble) And here are the healing mud baths of Spa Christine. Next door on your left is the exercise room. - In, out, in, out, let it burn, you hear? Let it burn, in, out, in, out - What is this crazy man saying? - Just nod and smile, he will go away. (exaggerated inhale/exhale) (Romanian folk music) (guests chat and mingle) - Welcome to the Grand Opening. - Thank you, you look beautiful. - Thank you, enjoy. - Christine. - [Voiceover] There was no way I was going to wear that Spa Christine tee shirt. I didn't care what my Mom would say. (rattles door handle and knocks) Hello? Hello? - [Voiceover] I never gave Tony enough credit. He certainly was persistent. - I appreciate that, thanks. - With pleasure. - Great. Did you check on Kevin? - Yeah, oh, he's tired. He's so cute when he's sleeping. - Oh, poor Kev, I'll go check on him. - Hun, actually, why don't you let him sleep a little while longer? (beats door with fist) (keys slide across floor) - Pavel! - Isn't this fabulous? - Oh yes. (Romanian folk music) - I thought you left. - I did, I just came back, plus, you need me, remember? For sword fighting and stuff. - Don't ask me why, but you've gotta do exactly what I say. I don't care what you do, just delay the ceremony. - What? - Just do it, come on. (suspenseful, fast-paced music) Hurry! - [Voiceover] Kevin... - Where are you? - [Voiceover] Right beside you. - I don't see you. - [Voiceover] Yes, I know, I'm fading. - No. - [Voiceover] Kevin... Kevin... Kevin! - Caramayonder, I call on you to appear. Rise from the heavens and awaken. (tapping glass for attention) - And now, I'd like to kick off the Official Opening of Spa Christine with a toast! - But, before he does, I feel as though I must say something about our gracious hosts. - Maycarayonder, I call on you to appear. Rise from the heavens and awaken. - To the new Spa Christine. - Hear hear! - The best health resort in Europe. May it shine and prosper and expand and profit and be the most beautiful place in the world. - Sofia, think! What are we missing? - Because the Spa Christine should be the place that we all enjoy and come to. - Caramayonder, I call on you to appear. Rise from the heavens and awaken. - May the castle be as beautiful as a rose. As a garden of roses. As glorious as Christine and-- - (clapping) Thank you, Pavel. And now, to you, Christine. (smoke and flames roaring) And to the Spa! (thunderclap) - Coraro! Coraro! Coraro! (guests talk nervously) (band members exclaim fearfully) - Hold on, everyone, it's just a thunderstorm. (corks pop) Nobody panic! Please. (wind wails) - Rise, rise! (guests scream and shout) - Rise! (glass explodes and shatters) (mud bubbles) (thunderclap) (guests panic and scream) (men shouting) - Leave! (corks popping) - Please, don't go! Wait, wait! - What's happening? - Mother! (dramatic music) (lightning cracks) - Wait, wait! Wait, no please, don't go! - Hunny, make it stop! Oh! (thunderous ether rushes) - You have defiled our home. - Momma? - You have disgraced the Climenco name. - I tried to protect it. I did my best. - But you have failed, Sofia. And the castle is fallen. It is filled with pestilence and hypocrites. Creatures not worthy of its glory. And now, on this tragic day, you shall endure the wrath of your ancestors! - No, Momma, please! - I cannot defend you, I cannot save you from your ancestry. From all the men who have shed their blood to defend these walls. You have destroyed us, Sofia. And now, you must pay. - Momma! - Stop! - Silence! You are nothing to me, little boy. An enemy, a trespasser, leave my sight at once. - You should have been there for her. A mother should be there for her child. No! Take her, take me! You can't do this! You're a Climenco! I thought Climencos had honor. I thought the Climencos were willing to die to protect their family. (spirit screams) - You are right, my child. - I'm sorry, Mother. - You have not failed, My Daughter, I have failed. That boy is right. Above everything, we are Climencos, I forgot what it entails. Thank you, Kevin. The castle will be restored immediately, Madam Climenco. I promise. Kevin, I am so proud of you. - Let go! - What about me? Don't I mean anything to you? - It's over. - I did everything you asked, the crystal balls, the seance, the spirit water. - Look, Sweetie, it's been fun, but I gotta plane to catch. (crying hysterically) - And where are you going? - There you are. I was just-- - Save it for your lawyer. Kevin was right and I was just too blind to see the truth. You two have probably been draining my accounts for months now. Just how much money have you taken? (crying hysterically) - Ah, it's hard to say. Chrissy, regrettably, all the payroll records were destroyed in a very unfortunate fire. (ghostly laughter) - Thank you, Sofia. - Out of my way, Squirt. - No way. You're a lying, cheating, stealing, ugly snake, and you're going to pay for what you did to my Mom. - I'd love to stay and play with you, Kevin, but... - [Voiceover] Yes! With the Climenco sword, good triumphs over evil once again! (coughing and spluttering) - Awesome! - I'm sorry, Kevin, I'm ready to start being a mother again. - I'd like that. - So would I. - You know, this is the first time I've ever seen you like this. - Like what? - I don't know, happy? - The President offered me the position at the National Theater Company. - Congratulations! He couldn't have chosen a better person. - Thanks. - So are you going to miss life in the big city, living here? - No, I've got everything I could ever want here. A home, a son, job... - A Head Butler? - Caretaker and Chief Coordinator. - You're getting the hang of this peeking thing. (laughter) - (chuckles) Come on. Oh, I almost forgot. Can I borrow both pairs of your roller blades sometimes? - Gotta be kidding, your mother? (laughs) She said when she comes to visit next month, we can do whatever I want. - You're going to have to let me teach her. - You must be jesting! You roller blade like you waltz. (laughing) - Sofia? - Got ya! - Not bad for a little ghost. (laughing) - [Voiceover] It's been years now, since I first moved to Sylvania. And who would have thought I still love living in this huge old haunted castle? But you know, things never turn out the way you think they will. And that's the fun of it.
