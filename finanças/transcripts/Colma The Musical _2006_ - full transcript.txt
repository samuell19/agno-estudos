Never made much sense to me. So you just graduated from high school. - Yeah, last week. - How's it feel to you? Uh, it's-- it's new. I mean, I've been waiting for it for such a long time. Now that it's actually here, it just feels like any other day, I guess. Uh-huh. I always thought that I'd have all the answers by the time I was 18. And, you know, now that I'm 18, I don't really feel any wiser. It's just part of the big journey, I guess, right? I drew those nipples huge. So, yeah, big journey and whatnot. - Are you going to college right away? - In August. - That's not too far away. - No. Uh, but I can schedule my classes around work. So it says here that-- where'd your tie go? - It's in my hand. - Why is it in your hand? I just-- you know, I thought that-- It's okay. Leave it off. Leave it off. - Yeah, it was an ugly tie anyway. - I know, right? So it says here that you were part of Thespian Troupe 2665. - Yeah. - Thespian. Thesbians. Yeah, we had a bumper sticker that said "Thespians do it onstage." - Now that's just juvenile. - I always thought so. - You had a paper route before this? - Yeah. And you want to work here? Yeah. Sell me this shirt. Okay. Um... Hello. Do you have any questions about this shirt? Oh, hello. I was wondering if you could tell me something about this shirt. Uh, I'd be glad to. What was your question? Actually, I have quite a few, sonny. Do you have this in a medium? Actually, sir, this is-- I am a woman. Don't call me "sir." Oh. Um, excuse me, ma'am. I think this is a medium. I see. You see, I have a tendency to put on weight and I was wondering if it would shrink on me. Um, I'd say, I think if you're careful-- You still live with your parents, huh? Yeah. - You don't do your own laundry? - No. It says that it's prewashed and preshrunk. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Don't worry about the things you don't know. That's what training is for.

But after a while it just became Chester House. Hmm, Chester House. That's cool. - Isn't it? - Both: No. Look, can you guys act normal for one night? - Normal. - Act.

We're just-- you know, criticism implies that we have some sort of evaluation process, and we don't. This party just fucking sucks. Yeah, whatever. Rodel, grab me three cups.

No. I don't even know who the fuck Margaret Avery is. Something random and quirky! I love this guy. Everybody listen up. I'm 21 years old, just like Maribel, just like Billy. We were talking earlier about how much we miss being 18, because we're certainly not 18 right now. - Crowd: Mm-hmm. - Right? And we were talking about how we used to sneak into college parties much like this one. You know, you've all done it. And I see all of you-- us, desperately clinging on to our high school years back when it was cool and subversive to flip off the camera. And we're all still a bunch of geeks and losers, right? - Am I right? - Man: I don't know about all that. So when I see us acting all hip and shit, I can't help but think to myself... ♪ Could we...

It was one thing for you to get drunk and start snapping at people at the party, but then you get all karaoke on everyone with my car alarm? - That was the fun part. - And you-- you're sober and you encouraged him. Sorry, Maribel. We didn't mean to mess up your night. You know, we meant to mess up our own. We keep forgetting that everything revolves around you. - What? - Maribel, he's drunk. It's the alcohol talking. You're a fucking bitch, Maribel. Jesus, Ro. That's the alcohol talking too. I'm sorry, Maribel. It's okay. No, I mean it. - I hate you. - What? I hate you? Not "I hate you." I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Maribel. You really are off your nut, you know that? I had fun getting drunk and singing show tunes on top of your car. Fag. - Call you tomorrow. - Okay. Good night. - You sure you're okay to drive? - Pretty sure. You can always crash here. My parents don't mind. - That might be a good idea. - Okay. Come on. Shit. Oh, my God, I'm fucking drunk. Yeah, you are. You know, Joanne used to do this too. Oh, really? Yeah, she had this way of pinning me up against the car. It was more like this. Come here. Kind of like that, with one leg. I think she thought she was being sexy. Wow, that's hot. Yeah, it was like that. She did it me one time after rehearsal. Got old pretty fast. Well, dude, I gotta go home. Give me my keys, byatch. You know, I'm glad you're straight-edged. - Why? - 'Cause if you were drunk tonight, I'd never hear the end of Joanne. God, you scared the shit out of me. Go to sleep. It's 3:00 in the morning. So how was the party? Go to sleep. Hey, did you get any pussy? Dad, don't ask me that. A father can't ask his own son if he got any pussy? You didn't take your meds today, did you? Jesus Christ, just 'cause I asked you a simple question about the party... Never mind. Go to sleep. You have one new message and 18 old messages. Man: Hello. This is Gary Nottingbird calling from Theater Peninsula. I'm calling for Billy Castillo. I just reviewed my notes from your audition the other day, and I wanted to call to make sure you're still interested in the part, which we do want to offer you. We just wanted to know what your availability was. Mr. Valode: Rodel! Michael is here. - Rodel! - What? Michael is here. Hey, Ro. - You want eggs? - Fuck, yeah. Yeah, I never really liked him anyway. I mean, I know I never said anything, but... Yeah, but I could tell. Which is fine, 'cause I hated Joanne. - Well, we're even, then. - Yeah. I told him I was perfectly fine being single, I'd never been happier. Never? Nope. Well, there was that one time my family told me I was adopted. Doesn't really count, though. A month later they told me they were just kidding. Jesus, that's fucked. Yeah. Happy times. Remember when I auditioned for "Friend Joseph"? - Yeah. - I got a call on the home line yesterday. - Yeah. - I got the part of Jerry. - Holy crap! - Shh. My parents are still asleep. - You got cast in "Friend Joseph"? - Yeah. - As who? - You remember the play? - Yeah. - You remember Jerry? - The quirky Jewish second-banana sidekick? - Yeah. - That's you? - That's me. Oh, my God, you're the quirky Jewish second-banana sidekick! I totally thought they were gonna cast me in the flamboyant gay role. There's a difference? I'm so happy for you. Oh, my God. Who did you get cast as? The gay guy? - No, I got cast as Jerry. - I thought he was the gay guy. No, he's the quirky Jewish sidekick. Yay! I'm so excited for you. Thank you. - Maribel: It's just kind of depressing. - Rodel: Why? I don't know. 19 just sounds so much closer to becoming a grown-up. And you're not a grown-up? No. I just want to look like a grown-up so I can get alcohol. It's not just that. I kind of feel like I've been clinging on to high school since we graduated. Ah, so that's why you've gotten so much louder ever since. Fuck you. I'm just kidding. Go ahead. I mean, high school-- Shh, keep it down. I'm right here. Can I talk now? Yeah, go ahead. High school, to me, was a place where you didn't have to make very many choices, at least not important ones anyway. Now that we're out of high school, I feel like that image I had of high school was just an image. Everybody thinks that about high school. Not Billy. And, to an extent, not you. You know, I always thought Billy would make it somewhere, though, - somewhere real big. - Not you? No. I used to dream about it, but... as long as I have whatever I write, I'm happy. You know, you really should buy a journal. It beats writing your ideas down on scraps of paper. Yeah, I know. I lost one of those scraps of paper in my room somewhere, by the way. That's very Emily Dickinson of you, by the way. Man: Good. Turn, turn, turn. And arms... Um, hi. I was wondering if you knew where the rehearsals for "Friend Joseph" were. That's what I'm trying to figure out. Oh, you're in the play too, then? Yeah. I'm Tara. Tara. I remember you. You were the one at the party at Chester House. Yeah? Which one? Well, you were in a Polaroid on the fridge. You were the one flipping the camera off. Hey, you're that sweaty guy from the bathroom. Great. That's how you remember me. Well, yeah. I felt really bad. I wanted to find out where you went, but then I had to go. - You were gonna look for me? - Well, yeah. I gave up on you, though, figured I lost you. Man: Step... I'm not so sweaty now. You're Filipino. You know what would happen. I don't know. My cousin came out to her dad, and she's fine. Jun's in prison. Imagine the heartache my dad would go through if he found out his good son's a fag. Okay, honestly, I don't know how he could not know. What the fuck's that supposed to mean? I'm just saying. You've never had a girlfriend. And Michael's been sleeping over for the past two years. - I just told him you're my girlfriend. - You fucker. Hey, I had to. I feel so used. Admit it, you're flattered. Well, yeah. So what's the surprise you have for me and Billy? - Holy shit. Those IDs look real. - Don't they? - You go in first. - We both go in. A couple of 40s, you know? Get something cheap for us. I'm 21. May I see your ID? 7.50. What the fuck, dude? Do I look old? Wow. I didn't realize this is going to be such a big deal. It is "Friend Joseph." There's really no other way to do it. Well, I'd better get to my car. Okay. Did you want to walk me to my car? Yeah, sure. Well, this is my car. - That wasn't far at all. - No. We're holding hands. Yeah. And now I'm kissing-- Tara, I kind of recently got out of a bad relationship. It's just a kiss.

God, I'm fucking happy you're having a drink. A drink, singular. So who's that girl you were kissing a while ago? Her name is Tara. She plays the ingenue in "Friend Joseph." Whoa. Dating from within the cast? Well, not necessarily. I told her that I'd just got out of a relationship. - Why did you say that? - 'Cause I did. - Yeah, like, three months ago. - That's pretty recent. Yeah, well, we didn't see you stop kissing her. Wait. We? You and Maribel saw? Yeah. Maribel was the one who pointed you out to me. Drink up, niggaz! Dude, check out that guy over there. - I love him! - You mean Hulk Hogan? That's fucked up. Don't call him Hulk Hogan. - Dude, I'll call him what I want. - Oh. Damn. Maybe you should slow down on that beer there. I want another one. Yes, you do. - What? - Is Ro home? No, he's out. Good. Look at you, coming in here with a bloke on each arm. Well, what can I say? I'm a lucky gal. Shit, I'd say those two bastards are the lucky ones. Are you all swingers? Yes. No, we're just friends from high school. Good.

How are things going for you here? Uh, fine. Everything's fine. Why? Well-- I'm just gonna spit it out. You've been working here for two weeks already, and I'm thinking of having you train for the register. Wow. Okay. Billy, this is more than okay. This shows I have trust in you. I don't just put any fucking mongoloid on the register. This is a big deal. - Well, that's stupendous, sir. - However-- and I'm gonna have to level with you here-- I've noticed you've already requested two days off in the last two weeks. Yeah, that's for my rehearsals. See, we have a set schedule for rehearsals. But there isn't a set schedule here, so I just-- Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean, we don't have a set schedule here? You get the printed schedule the week of. Yeah, but I need more notice than that. I mean, it's hardly a set schedule. It changes every week. All right, how many more days off in the future do you think you're gonna be requesting? I don't know. I mean, I guess whenever my schedule here clashes with my rehearsals. That was the wrong answer. So what are you saying I should do? Well, I think you should either make arrangements with your theater people, or-- and I'm not trying to sway your decision or anything here, but you should go with us. Any mongoloid would know it's the right choice. Tara: Since you stay with your parents, is there really any reason for you to have this job? Yes, I need this job. I would go crazy if I didn't have this job. Well, maybe you can get a different job that allows you to-- Babe, I need the job. I need the money. I'm saving up for something big. Saving for what? Something big, okay? You know, it's the best-paying shit job I can get right now. - Sorry if I'm being nosy. - You're not being nosy. Joanne-- she was nosy. Hey, what's up with that party we're going to tonight? Yeah, it's a networking party. There's gonna be writers and actors and directors - and even some bands. - Nice. That sounds cool. Yeah, I was thinking about bringing my cards with me-- you know, pitch myself to these directors. I should do that too, 'cause they're always looking for more actors. Actually, I was thinking about bringing some of my plays too. People want writers just as much. Yeah, but they're a dime a dozen. You know, I really like what you've done with your character, by the way. You've really made it your own. Thanks. You know, I'm pretty proud of it. You know, it's a new "Friend Joseph," so I figured, why not create a new Jerry? I want to be known for this version of Jerry. - How's Rodel doing? - He's all right. I don't think that he likes me very much. - Why would you say that? - Just a feeling. Like whenever he's around, there's this really subtle vibe that, you know, if you're not sharp, you'll miss it. Hmm. I thought I'd find you here eating, what, orange chicken? Dude, I like orange chicken. Yeah, I know. But that's not orange chicken. That's deep-fried, Westernized Chinese versions - of chicken nuggets in orange sauce. - Dude, orange-colored sauce. - I know, right? Hi, Rodel. Hey, how did the flyering go? Uh, five neighborhoods today, I think. Yeah, I did five neighborhoods. Damn. Nice. We should have a good audience for opening night at least. By the way, I am doing your laundry from now on. Um, weird. Okay. - Why? - I need to practice. See, I need to look at tags and labels so I could tell customers how to wash their own clothes. So you want to experiment with my clothes. He just wants more clothes to wash than he already has. Hi. Guess who I was talking to. Oh, I gotta go. - See you at home, man. - Yeah, see you at home. Bye. - So... - Hello? Hey, Maribel. No, sorry, my phone's on vibrate. No, I'm at the cafe right now. I was just talking to Billy. No, nothing much, really-- just, you know, eating. Bye, Ro. Oh. "Bye, Ro." Yeah, suddenly she knows me so well. Yeah, she can call me Ro. She leaves her food here for other people to clean up. - So fucking self-centered. - Are you talking about me? Oh, now she thinks I'm talking about her. Yeah, whatever. Now she's walking away like a freshly fucked fucking prostit-- Hello? Do you know what today is? Thursday. Did you want to be alone today? Yeah. Good.

I really am. I just think it might be cooler if we all moved in together, you know? I know. Still living in his parents' house. Yeah, that feels awkward-- you know, just having piles of my clothes lying around his room. Just clothes? I never got the rest of my shit from my dad. Are you going to? I don't know.

By the way, Maribel... What? Happy birthday. - Hey. - Hey. Oh, I washed all of your clothes. Wow, thanks. No, um, - you know your black shirt? - Yeah. You took my black shirt and made it look like some kind of fucked-up sock puppet. Hey, you want to come with us to that networking party tonight? - A who? - There's a networking party. There's gonna be, like, actors and directors and writers there. It's actually called a networking party? How shameless is that? Most people try to disguise it by calling it a tsunami benefit or something. Yeah, it's pretty to the point, I guess. Dude, we're taking Maribel out for her birthday. - Did you forget? - No, I didn't forget. I just sort of planned everything really poorly. - You forgot. - Yeah, I forgot. Dude, it's okay. There'll be more networking parties. What makes you think I'm not going? I don't know, Billy. Maybe 'cause Maribel's one of your best friends. Oh, come on. Don't give me that. Do you think I can afford not to be seen at this party? You can't afford not to be seen at this party? No, I can't. Well, if he can't, he can't, you know? Yeah. I mean, he says he's sorry. Okay. You don't sound okay. He could have called me himself. He never flakes. Well, I mean, it was an emergency rehearsal, you know? I mean, he had to get on the road as soon as he got the message. Plus his cell phone's dead. I-- I had to come and relay the message for him. Interesting. Wow. Didn't expect to see you here. Yeah, that party was pretty lame. It was less like schmooze and booze, and it was more like booze and snooze. Tara made some contacts, and some director wanted to put me in his Latin play. It was pretty lame. Probably should have gone with you guys. Probably would have been more fun. How's Maribel? Did you hear me? How's Maribel? I told her you had an emergency rehearsal - and that your cell phone was dead. - Nice. She still seemed really sad that you weren't there. Jesus Christ, you gave her that story, and she still laid a guilt trip on you? How self-centered can you get? We got, like, four weeks until we open. Yeah, well, you should call her anyway. She's visiting LA for a week. Yeah, I probably should. Hello. Hi, baby. Yeah? Good. I had a wonderful time. Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh-huh. "Tara and Billy-- the perfect match. I've got a match-- his face and her ass. Both have their sights on the stars and the sky. It's their excuse to have their noses so high"? - Why'd you write this? - Where'd you get that? - From your pocket. - You go through my fucking pockets? Are you gonna be the type of dad who reads his kids' diaries? How dare you? How dare you write this shit? What, do you think it's not true? I'm going to bed, Billy. I need to wake up early so I can pass out your flyers. So this isn't as big as I thought it was gonna be. It's not big. I mean, it's pretty big for a regional theater, but, God, the way Billy's been talking about this, I kind of expected something bigger. - Word. - Right? - Hey, it's Billy. - Oh, he's looking for us. - Hi, honey. - Hey. Oh. Everybody, this is Maribel. And this is my bestest friend in the world Rodel. This is Gary the director. - You guys know Tara. - Hi. And this is John. He helped flyer. In all kinds of crazy neighborhoods. - Rodel helped flyer too. - Cool. Sorry, I'm gonna have to cut this short. I have to tend to the rest of the actors. It was really nice meeting you. - I'm gonna go help Gary. - Okay. - Enjoy the show. - Hey, thanks. - Dude, don't be catty. - What? Oh, before I forget... Cool. Thanks, man. Hey, it's the least I can do after all those flyers you passed out. Now get back in there and change. - Oh. - You should go soon? I should go now. Did he just pay that guy in front of you? Yeah. - Did you count $100? - I did. And how much did Billy pay you for flyering? Well... jack shit. Oh, man. - Oh, man. - What? Don't look now, but when you can, look who's in line to see the show.

Billy, I used to hope that I could go one day without you mentioning her fucking name. Do you know that? I told you I got out of a bad relationship. I never said I wanted anything. No, you never said a thing. Tara never really believed in the Grail. How can you fucking joke about this? 'Cause it is a fucking joke. Whatever, dude. We'll talk later. No, we probably won't. Why? Why? Why? Why, Rodellio? I hate you! I hate you! - Hey. - Hey. If you want to put those in my car-- It's okay. You're not that far away.

Maybe I know just what you meant to me. That's nothing and everything all at once." You looked really happy when you came back from LA, by the way. - I got laid. - It's not just that. You had a glow about you. You ever think about moving to LA? LA? That's just as bad as moving to New York. Whatever, man. You'd be out of Colma. Nah. I can't. Why not? Billy says you're too rainbows and unicorns for LA. - What the fuck does he know? - Right? You know, the night of your birthday he didn't really have rehearsal. You know, I kind of figured. - I made that up. - You made that up? Yeah, he actually didn't want to go. He tried to drag me to some stupid networking party with Tara. I told him, you know, "It's Maribel's birthday--" So you knew that night, but you didn't tell me the truth. It was your birthday. I didn't want to hurt your feelings. But you'll hurt my feelings now? I figured you should know. Why tell me now? Why tell me at all? 'Cause you don't like Billy anymore, you figure it's okay to hurt my feelings? Would you rather I didn't tell you at all? I don't know. It's cool. Never mind. Listen, things got out of hand. Things were said. Basically everybody's at fault here. Yeah, everybody. So you're mad at me. No. I'm fine. I don't believe that. Well, if I am, maybe I'll tell you next week. You know those rare days when there's no fog and you can see clear out past the city limits and you can't help but notice the San Francisco skyline and you realize how close we actually are to a major metropolis? And I wonder, you know, when the fog clears, do people in San Francisco notice us? I mean, why would they, right? The most they would see from over the hills and fog would be this flat land with a bunch of houses all lined up in sort of a wavy grid. Or maybe it could be something somber and tragic, when all they see are a bunch of graveyards. And they can't see the little things that make us so much different from the city. I mean, kids play in huge groups in the street. People have driveways. Neighbors have barbecues in their backyards. People fucking have backyards. Yeah, and then there's the fog. When it's thicker than your average mist, and you can see it rolling in on the city like a huge lumpy blanket. When I was small, I would stand on this hill and watch as the sunny sky turned to fog as it rolled over and through me. And I would pretend that I was being carried on the grassy hump of a flying city, slowly breaking through the clouds as we soar off into the horizon, and my city in the clouds taking me somewhere better. Then the fog clears and the grass around my feet is moist with dew. And the sun burns off whatever mist is left, and, you know, I can see the skyline of San Francisco way off in the distance and I'm happy. ♪ One day I'll find my happy place ♪ ♪ And I ain't gonna share nothing with you ♪ ♪ 'Cause you've got your own ♪ ♪ You have your own ♪ One day I'll find my happy place ♪ ♪ And I'm determined that I'm never gonna find ♪ ♪ My way back out ♪ My way back out ♪ I know we'll lie somewhere ♪ ♪ Beyond the clouds and open air ♪ ♪ My heart is stopping, I don't care ♪ ♪ I know that I'll be ♪ There ♪ One day I'll find my happy place ♪ ♪ And maybe then I'll find a person ♪ ♪ Who can curl up in my arms ♪ ♪ In my arms ♪ I know we'll lie somewhere ♪ ♪ Beyond the clouds and open air ♪ ♪ My heart is stopping, I don't care ♪ ♪ I know that I'll be there ♪ ♪ One step at a time ♪ I climb ♪ To the highest point ♪ ♪ I know that if I try ♪ ♪ I'll fly ♪ So high you won't believe ♪ ♪ What I can do ♪ It's true ♪ My happy place is waiting ♪ ♪ In the sky ♪ And I ♪ Can meet you there. - Hey. - Hey. - I'm leaving. - I know.

That's very Rodel of you. I-- I don't see how, but okay. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. When did the whole New York thing come up? Remember when I moved into Maribel's, took my bags over to her house? I think that night was the first time I realized that I'm unhappy. Hmm. I told Maribel the reason you didn't come to dinner that night. Oh. Yeah. And the poem that I wrote-- I wrote that intentionally for you to read, and I had it folded up and sticking out of my pocket on top of the laundry, 'cause I knew you'd find it there. Why would you do that? I don't know, Billy. Maybe 'cause I'm unhappy? I don't have any reasons for anything I do. Well, I'm leaving. Yeah, I see that. You look packed. Yeah, finally moving. Where to?
