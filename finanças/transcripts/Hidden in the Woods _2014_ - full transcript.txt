The boogeyman is not gonna hurt you anymore, I'll take care of you. Anny, what are you doing? Nothing. What do you mean, "nothing"? You're still playing with that stupid doll. It's not a stupid doll. Of course it is. Stop it, leave me alone. You know what Papi says. I know, I know. He says you're too old to play with dolls. I know. Look at me. I don't play with dolls anymore. Hello, Señor Costeos, como estas? Muy bueno amigo, I'm doing just fine. It's a beautiful day, isn't it? Heard you had your eye on that spicy little thing from the market with the nice round ass. Tell you something, Oscar, in my life, there've been a lot of beautiful women with nice round asses, what's one more or less? [CHUCKLING] Your daughters, they're looking more lovely every day. Even more beautiful than their mother. Very pretty, indeed. They're the best things I have, my pride and joy, my flesh and blood. Well, maybe one day introduce me to your eldest. I mean, she looks like her mama. I mean, who knows, maybe one day she'll come and work for me. Get me six kilos. Yes, sir. ANNY: I don't want to play with him anymore. ANA: With who? You should never point. Never. Yo, Bull Dog, heads up. COSTELLO [LAUGHS]: Startin' to slip, Bull Dog. I think you been doing too much tequila lately. Remember, buddy, nobody's irreplaceable. Okay, Uncle, we're done. We'll settle up later. So how many kilos I got left? Thirty, more or less. All right, stay safe, Oscar. Keep your enemies close and your daughters closer. Whatever you do, look out for my merch. With my life. Chicas, inside. [EXHALES LOUDLY, SNIFFS] Finish your fuckin' plates. I miss Mama so much. ANA: Me too. I wish I could have spent more time with her. You were just a bebe when she left us. Do you think she's in heaven now? Of course she is, she's an angel now. But she'll always be in our hearts. Why did she leave us? 'Cause she loved us too much. [♪♪♪] [MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY] [YELLING AND SCREAMING] Stick this rag in your mouth! See, this is what happens when you go to school! Push! Push! Push! Push, push! This is your fault! Push! Push, you whore! You fucking whore, push! Push! Push! Push! Push! Come on, Anny. It's time to feed Michael! Come on. Brisa. Michael.

I'm so sorry. [SOBBING] I'm so sorry. WOMAN: Why do we always get the shit calls? Maybe you shouldn't call the sheriff, a lecherous, low-down, limp-dick, son-of-a-bitch. Well, maybe the sheriff shouldn't have tried to get in my pants. I should've kicked him in the balls. It's my duty to uphold the law, right? I'd like to see that. Where the fuck do these people live? You know what? Fuck this. Let's blow this off. Are you serious? Yeah. This is a domestic abuse call. I have zero tolerance for any of this macho bullshit. Come on, let's just do this. You know what they call domestic abuse out here? Foreplay. You are a sick motherfucker, let's just go. Look at this fucker. Oh, shit, look at this. [POLICE SIREN WAILS] [CHAINSAW REVVING] Hey, buddy. Sir. Hello, sir, excuse me, señor! WOMAN: Sir, turn off your chainsaw. What the hell do you want? I want you to turn off your fucking chainsaw, and I won't ask you again. And I want you to get off my property, and I won't ask you again. You're gonna wanna drop that chainsaw. Drop it. I'm on my own property, I'm minding my own business. Drop the fucking chainsaw, right now. I'm on my own property, I'm minding my own business. You drop that fucking chainsaw. OSCAR: I'm minding my own business. Drop that fucking weapon. WOMAN: Drop it. You drop that right now. Drop it. Help us! Somebody help us! [SCREAMING] Somebody help us! What the fuck was that? What the fuck was that? You stay here. ANA: Can you hear us out there? Don't you move. Don't move, motherfucker. You stay where you are. I said, don't fucking move. Can you hear us? Help us, somebody help us! This is the police. [SCREAMING] Open the fucking door. I'm shooting the lock. [GUN FIRES] ANA: Please, somebody help us! Please help us! Don't move. [CRYING] Our father, please, help us get away from him. I've got two girls and a boy in here, watch your fucking back. What? [SCREAMING] Okay, let's go. Let's go. Quick, come on, come on. [SCREAMS] Run! Run, girls, run. [GIRLS SCREAMING] Go, run. Officer down, get down here now. You want some, huh? WOMAN: I will fucking kill you. You want some of this, what your partner got? You want some, huh? Come on, you want some. WOMAN: Get back, you crazy fuck. Come on, bitch. [CHAINSAW REVVING] [GUN FIRES] [♪♪♪] WOMAN: You don't have to do this. Yes, I do. [SCREAMS] [GRUNTING] [SCREAMING] MAN: Come on, Stello, ain't nobody, nobody gonna suspect our hogs are carrying our drugs. Hogs! What do you think, you're the first person to ever think of that idea? Look, you're a very smart man, Ricco, and ambitious. And I've gotta admit, you've earned us a lot of money in the past, but you have to understand that I conduct my business the way I do for a reason. But, baby, money is time, time is money. You have to remember who's the boss. Of course. Come on, how many, how many years we known each other, 10, 12? Eleven. Bam, there you go. No problem, right? You can trust me. I know I can. I mean, we're good friends, right? Yeah, we drank much tequila together, fucked many señoritas. [PHONE RINGS] Am I wrong? No, that's right. Don't ever try to fuck me, Ricco. Now, go on, get the fuck out of here, go earn us some money. Yeah, got you. Sir, Oscar. Oscar? Yes, sir. Hey, it's Oscar. What are you doing calling me? You don't call me, I call you, when I want my merchandise. Yes, I know, I know. Then why the fuck are you calling me? It's the cops, I just killed two of them. I need your help to get away. Where is my merchandise? If the cops catch me, we're both fucked. Please, I need help. All right. You go to the bus station. In two hours, I'll have two of my men come and give you some money so you can disappear for a while. The bus station, okay. Two hours, I'll be there. But Oscar, whatever you do, you bring my merch. [SCREAMING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] ANNY: We're never gonna go home, Ana? Maybe, but we still can't go back. Why? Because if we go back, the authorities will take Michael away from us. You wouldn't want that, would you? Mom, no. ANNY: Ana! OSCAR: Only God can forgive your sins. Sir. Sir, you okay? [♪♪♪] You're bleeding pretty bad, do you want me to get you some help, sir? Army? Marine, sir. [SCREAMING] [GUN FIRES] [CROWD SCREAMS] Semper Fi, motherfucker. [POLICE SIRENS WAILING] MAN: Hands up! You, on the ground. Hands up! Get on the ground now! MAN: Clear! On the ground. On the ground. Get on the ground. Get on the ground. MAN: We've got a problem. Yeah, no shit. So where to? Near the tracks. I know a place that nobody goes anymore. Wait, you don't mean Daddy's cabin? It'll be safe enough for now. What, nowhere's safe with him. Don't start this again, okay? Even if we were around, he would never go back there, not after what happened with Mama. There's cocaine missing. It's him. I knew he couldn't control his ambition. That settles it, we'll get rid of him. Who do you want to handle it? I will. What? Why? Why not just have one of the coyotes do it? No, my friend, when a man picks up a gun and steals from you, that takes guts. You can afford to show him the honor and respect of a soldier's bullet. But when a man smiles you in the eyes and steals from you, it's personal. I'll kill him. MAN: Sir. So, what happened? Well, uh. The fucking bastard got himself arrested. Stupid fuck. I told you I never trusted that motherfucker. You give me a job, it's done, properly. Ricco, you keep your mouth shut. This doesn't concern you. Don't worry, boss, Oscar ain't gonna talk, and even if he did, the cops ain't gonna believe him. He's a fucking lunatic. Well, I think at this point, we have to figure he's gonna talk. [LAUGHING] Why are you laughing? Do you find something amusing about this situation? But boss, Horace is still in jail. I guarantee you, one word from me, he'll find the location and take care of him, kill him. That's a good idea. Come on. Come on, let's have a tequila together. You deserve it. [GUN FIRES] Shit. COSTELLO: And you deserve that. I don't like people laughing out of turn. George, drag him outside and feed him to my pigs. Yes, sir. Shame to waste good tequila. Fuck. About the other matter? Later. Let him have his fun. Get in touch with Horace and tell him his uncle needs a favor.

Dude, my fucking dog's smarter than that idiot. I don't understand why a fucking lame like him is calling shots for fucking Costello's crew anyway. That's why I'm asking. I have no idea. He takes the orders. I'm good at that though, I don't understand why he's in front of me. He should be fucking washing my drawers. [LAUGHING] I still don't understand though, why, why are you taking orders from him, who's taking orders from Uncle Costello, that doesn't make any sense to me. Because I don't have any pictures of Uncle Costello blowing a fucking goat, 'cause that's what he's gotta have. That's how he got the job? I don't know, but he didn't fucking just get it on his merits, the guy's a fucking lame. I wanna be number three, 'cause that's my favorite number. Three, really? Yeah, but if you're number...

You don't just fucking, you don't retire his number. But I don't want to be number two, two sounds like fucking shit. Like, if I'm number two, just came out of a fucking ass. Oh, you're fucking crazy, dude. I'm just gonna fuckin sit... God, that booger's so bad. JEB: Here he comes, here genius, glad you could make it.

MAN: Do you want me to drive? [PHONE BUZZING] What the fuck you want? BULL DOG: Our Uncle Costello wanted me to send you his regards. Last night La Parco, Oscar Cocker, got locked up. He's holding, and we need to know the location. Hey, tell fucking Horace his mom says hi. No wait, he's too fucking stupid. So once you find the location... Would you guys shut the fuck up? JEB: Tell Horace I just fucked his mom. BULL DOG: Once you find the location, I want you to make sure that Oscar is well looked after in there, you understand? Understood. Well looked after. And once, I want you to remember that our uncle never forgets a favor. Oh, you owe me big time. Get on it. What is your fucking problem, man? JEB: You know Horace is probably... I'm trying to do business here, and you guys are fucking around. You know Horace is probably gonna give him a back rub now, right? Shut the fuck up.

Maybe Papi, but I'm more worried about Uncle Costello. Where are we gonna go? I don't know, some place far away, okay? Maybe we can go to the coast. You know, I've always wanted to see the ocean.

Uh, 250. Dollars? I'm not talking pesos, sweetheart. Of course dollars. There must be something that I could, uh, I could do? I don't touch the trash, okay? Anything else, miss? No? I'll be back. Okay. Yeah. No, this wasn't a waste of time. No, there's a huge untapped market out here. No. Yeah, just keep laughing, Susan, but some people actually appreciate a good idea when they see one.

No, it was my pleasure. How can I pay you back? Thought you didn't have any money. Hey, has anyone ever told you you're very pretty. My father, my uncle. I mean, they were wrong, because you're beautiful. And you have a killer smile. I just checked out of my hotel, but my SUV is parked right over there, if you want to talk? Yeah. Hello. That way.

Do you know why I asked Paul to bring you here to me now? Tell him, Paul. We're missing five kilos of cocaine. Five kilos of cocaine, Ricco. That's a lot of money. [SCOFFS] You wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Did you steal my coke, Ricco? You serious? This is bullshit. I would never steal from you. You like my own flesh and blood. [SCREAMS] Look me in the eyes, Ricco. Look me in the eyes... and tell me... are you the one who stole my five kilos of cocaine? Did you take what was mine? [CRYING] Uncle Costello, I was gonna tell you. I swear to God I was gonna tell you. I just wanted you to see what the potential that we had together. See, I know this guy in Miami, and he want to buy all the drugs we can sell him. I mean, we could be USDA grade all over the country, all over the world, baby. I just need a little more time.

Bull Dog, I hear you're looking for Oscar's kids. Yeah. Well, I picked up three hitchhikers, two cunt sisters. Okay, and? Their retard bit my arm, I got the bite marks to prove it. You're gonna have to do better than that. All right. Will that do? [PHONE RINGS] [LAUGHING] JEB: What are you laughing at? We got 'em. So where did you say these bitches are? I didn't, and I won't, unless you pay me. Well, what do you want? Just text me some choice nudes of their corpses when you're done. BULL DOG: You are one sick chick, heh, but you've got a deal. All right, they're headed down toward Columbus, near the Mexican border. Said they're gonna visit their grandma's cabin or some bullshit like that. All right. Saddle up, let's go. MAN: What about the fucking hot dogs? BULL DOG: Let's go. [SPEAKS SPANISH] Yeah, I'm just gonna go ahead and take these, brother. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Yeah, I'll come back, I'll be back, I know. ANA: You guys are gonna clean yourselves up. Come on, let's go. You're making a mess, you're making a mess. Stop, give me that. Give me your hand. ANNY: I'm sorry, Ana. Michael, no, that's poison! What are we gonna do with this? It must be worth so much money. This is blood money. We have enough money. Oh, yeah? Where did you get that money? Did you steal it? No, I earned every penny. How? You don't need to know. Ana, we have to get out of here. When Daddy finds out what we did... I have a plan, okay. I got somebody who's gonna take us outta here. Yeah. Baby, I'm so... When? Tomorrow morning. [MUSIC PLAYING ON HEADPHONES] MAN: What the fuck's your problem, douche bag? Get up. You're my fucking problem, man. Tell him if you've seen those two girls. Nope, haven't seen those two girls. Bullshit. What are you doing? Whoa, take it easy, boys. A little visual aid, huh? Let me be thorough, yeah? Yeah, how thorough. Like I was saying, I haven't seen those two girls, but I have seen that one little pain in the ass, that pitiful little face of hers. So? Well, I might just have an idea. JEB: Where the fuck is she? Who's the babe? That your girlfriend? None of your business. I'm looking for two girls and a young boy. What are you, some kind of cop? Do I look like a fucking cop? You kind of do. I don't want any trouble. Why don't I get you gentlemen a beer? Go get 'em. Now. Three beers! Anyone seen... these people? These girls? Anyone... seen these girls? Anyone? Come on. Somebody must have seen them. You? You? MAN: Is there a reward? Yeah, there is a fucking reward, man. You know what it is? You get to draw another fucking breath. [SCREAMS] The bitch is his girlfriend. Who, him? Yeah. Whoa, slow down there, skip. Where you going? I'm telling you, she's not my girlfriend. Then why do you have a picture of her on your cell phone? Oh, see, that's a good question. Oh that's a good fucking question. Oh, bullshit. Where the fuck is she? Oh, what the fuck is that? That's that same bitch. Whoa, how many of these fucking pictures have you taken? BULL DOG: Do you know her or not? I only met her a few days ago, she means nothing to me. Good, then you don't mind telling us where she's at. I'm not from around here, I would not know where to find her. So you don't know where we can find her? No, I don't know. Oh, fuck you, you know where she is. I wouldn't know. So you're basically of no use to us whatsoever, at all. That is a damn shame. The fuck is right. Get his ass outside. Which fucking way, man? Which fucking way? I don't know. You don't know. You better fucking pick one. He's not sure. I think he knows. Hey. Oh, he knows. He just don't want to give it up, and that kinda makes me want to shoot him in the back of the fucking head. One, two. It's that way, left. Are you sure? Yes, it's left. Then that's the way we go. How do we know you're telling the truth there, bubba? Yeah, well... It's that way. This don't lie. [LAUGHING] What do you want me to do? [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] I want you to go inside and get me some donuts. Come on, go get your girl. Is this the place or what, boy, huh? Come on. Where's my bitches? Who's there? Run! ANA: Jesus! Oh, shit! Dammit, he's gonna drag this out till the end. Come on, Bull Dog, you're having one of those days. Fucking porch, get after her. I told you to run. ANNY: He wasn't moving. Whoa, whoa, whoa. [SCREAMING] JEB: We're just going for a ride, come on. Ah, there's nowhere to run. ANNY: They're gonna kill us, they're gonna kill us. ANA: I won't let them touch you. Let's just go. We've got things to do. Come on downstairs, will ya? No, I like it here. You want something? ANNY: No, no, no, no, no. Can we go? ANA: Anything, anything. Fuck, yeah. Fuck, yeah. ANA: No, no, no, no, no. [SCREAMING] No, please don't, please don't. [SCREAMING] No. Please don't, please don't. I like this one. Please don't! Michael! [SCREAMING] Please don't, please don't. ANA: Don't touch her, I'll fucking kill you. Let go of me. This one is finger-licking good right here. No, please don't, please don't. No! No! Please, don't! No, no! Stop! [GRUNTING] It's okay, shh. No, no, no, no, no! Oh, you're gonna like this. No. Please, no! Please, no, don't! No! Oh! [SCREAMING] You like that? Son of a bitch. Fuck, pick up two girls, take them to Costello's, how hard could it fucking be? Oh. Oh, yeah. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [GRUNTING] [CRYING] [SCREAMING] Fuck! You fucking bitch. Really? Really? [SCREAMING] [GUN FIRES] Go, go! I don't want to leave you, I don't want to leave you. [SOBBING] ANNY: Ana, let's go! Let's go! [♪♪♪] [BOTH GROANING] BULL DOG: What the fuck! [♪♪♪] Hey! Ha-ha-ha! [ALL GASPING] You, you fucked me and my uncle... and I'm gonna fuck you right where the sun don't shine, bitch. Anny, just run, okay. Hey! You move... and I will blow her head off. You move, until I'm done... I will blow her head off. Give me a reason. Hey! ANA: I'll be okay. You are such a little girl. Such a pretty little girl. He's too drunk to fuck. [MICHAEL SCREAMING] [GUN FIRES] Who sent you to kill us? Who sent you? My Uncle Costello. But he doesn't want you dead, he wants you alive and kicking. We're gonna do all the kicking. ANA: Anny stop, Anny stop. We need him alive. Okay, go, go, get up. [SCREAMING] Piece of shit, you fucking piece of shit. Walk! I'll fucking blow your head off. I'm gonna bleed to death. It's too quiet. Sir? I don't like peace, I don't trust it. As you know, some of our business has gone bad this week. That's why we must be more aware, more vigilant. Especially when it comes to my family. I don't want to have anything happen to them. Anything. You hear me? Anything. Family is the most important thing. That's why I do what I do. That's why I run this town. Do you have your gun? Yeah. Good. Elizabeth. All right, I want you boys to promise me that you're gonna behave. And you, you mind your mother. Give pop a hug. All right, now off with you. Are you not coming? You promised you'd come to church with me. I know I did, but I have some last-minute business that came up. You said that last week, and the week before that, and the week before that. I know, my love, but you must understand that in the world of God, you are our emissary. Me, I have to do man's work. So go now, you have a date with God. But if you want, perhaps later, we might have a little date of our own. Yes. Go. It's a sin to keep the man above waiting. Okay. [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON TV] The football game's on. Sit. We're gonna die out here in the fucking woods. You fucker. You, what the hell? Where are my babies? Your babies. [GUN FIRES] Wait, wait, wait, wait! Costello's. Thank you. Nobody messes with my babies. Go with God. [GRUNTING] Please, he's gonna die here. Left or straight? I said, left or straight? [SCREAMS] Ow, left, left, left. [GRUNTING] [DOOR KNOCKS] It's about fucking time. ANA: Time to shut your mouth. Ah, the gang's all here. Speaking of gangs, where's mine? Dead, like you'll be if you don't leave us alone. Is that what you want? Your wish is my command. Tell him to drop his gun! George, put the gun down. We're not stupid. COSTELLO: I didn't say you were stupid, I was just trying to... I told you to shut up! It's our turn to do the talking. COSTELLO: All right. All right, talk. I will. We want you to know that we want nothing to do with you, or our father. We're not gonna go to the police. We just want to be left alone. Now you can talk. COSTELLO: Regardless of what you think of me, I'm a man of honor. I don't trust him. Ana, I don't trust him. If you want to end this, you have to kill him. [LAUGHING] Why are you laughing at me? You wouldn't kill your father, would you? My father's not here. Oscar's not your father. I am. ANNY [SCREAMING]: Ana, what is going on? You want to know what I'm talking about. I'm talking about that I fucked your mother, and I think maybe now I'm gonna fuck your sister. You looking for me, huh, you looking for me? Here I am! [GUN COCKS] Boo! [GASPS] Ha-ha-ha! You're gonna shoot me? [LAUGHING] Huh? I don't have to listen to you anymore. You're not my father! ANA: Anny, please, let's go. OSCAR: What are you talking about? He told me the truth! He's my father! No, no, no! Maybe... Maybe we just do this old school, huh? Old school. Huh? [CRYING] [SCREAMING] Eenie, meenie, minie, moe, catch a... Go to hell.
