Lennart! Hi! Welcome! Hi! - Did you buy cigarettes? - Yes darling! - Hey, Walter! - Hi. Welcome, Chief Executive Olsson! Good morning! Ouch! - Walter, why didn't you bear off! - What? With the boat-hook - that the piece of wood with iron in the end. - Which end? - Idiot! That's easy for you to say, while sitting at the helm. - I'm steering now. - I can feel that. Kalle, we're drifting out. Ouch! Sore... It has stopped blowing now, too. - Weren't we going ashore? - Shut up! Help me with the sails. - Let's use the engine. - No! This is a sailboat. I suggest we drop anchor here and take the rubber dinghy to shore. - Get the dinghy. - Throw the anchors, Walter. - Oops, it fell in. - I can see that! Hey, it broke... Help, you guys. It's sinking, you guys... Help! - We'll get you with Garbo's boat! - What? Garbo! Fisherman! Rowing boat! Hello there! Garbo has gone to town with his boat! Use the engine! The crayfish are waiting! - No way, I'm a sailor! - No, not the engine. - We'll try one more time. - Fix the anchor in the bow. Clear ahead! Come on then! - It looks good. Come on! - Lay off the engine! Why did you have to use the engine? I told you... Walter, take down the sail before we run aground. We've run aground. - Move towards the bow, Walter. - The bow? O...O... hey! O...hey! Try to grab the mark! Come on, grab the mark! Hold on, we're drifting! Help, help! Hold me! Mona! Help, hold me! Kalle! - Pull me in. - Drop it already! Walter! - Are you deaf? - Hurry up, please! - Slowly, slowly! - Please hurry! - Hold on, I'll start the engine. - I'm holding. I'm holding... Something to seal this with! We have to paddle to shore. Take the helm, Mona. Watch out, here's a rope! Oops! How about the Chief! Wake up, Chief! Chief! Please, Chief! Okay then... Oh dear, oh dear! So, goodbye! Okay then. Bye! Mom! Mom, you've got to help us! No, no! Not again! Move away, here I come. Come on mom! Come on lady! Bravo, mother-in-law! - Bravo, lady! - Bravo! Mother! Poor little man, has he fainted! Yx... gax... tojnaf! - Come and help me pull, Walter! - Come on then! - Do something! Hurry! - Come on, Walter... Good! Pull! Come on. Pull! Come on, pull! Pull! No, no, no! Take the rope from the raft and swim ashore! Hey, I think the anchor is in. Will she get ashore anytime soon? Or what will it be? The rope is too short! The rope is too short. No, fasten us to that mark. I give up! I want crayfish now! Here comes the bridge piece. - Hey, you? You! - Yes? Can't we use the bridge piece and paddle ashore or something? Yes. Get up now, Chief Olsson. Stop lying there. We're going ashore. You sleep a lot, Olsson. We're going ashore. Wake up! Chief Olsson, you're not as cocky now as you tend to be at work. - Don't say things like that Walter! - The boat, the boat! Jeez, he's floating away. Do something! Do something! Do something then!

No, you've got your lady pants. - Who is the master of this boat? - You. You've got the lady pants. Shut up about my pants! I risk my life for Chief Olsson... and this is what I get from you, smartass! - I have in any case no lady pants. - Calm down! - Shut up! You destroy rubber boats. - That's too much! - Leave my hat alone! - Apologize! - Never! This is mutiny! - Go down into the cabin. - Otherwise, I let go of the hat. - No! Don't do it! Not the hat!

Let's play another game of bridge. How nice! Mr. Garbo! Do you want a glass of... ...water? - Ouch! - Shut up! *inaudible*! No, I wasn't there. It must have been boat thieves. *inaudible*... No, I thought I heard some boat... a motorboat... I've been here all the time. It was you! It was you who sank the boat! Huh? Who? Me? No. We've been playing bridge all night. I haven't been there. How many cards? *inaudible*! He says: "You're dismissed from the house." "You can go to hell." "I'll lock up the cottage." "And I'm emigrating to America." "Tomorrow, and this is the fucking passport." "And five thousand dollars."

"Here's a letter from my fiancé¦¥." ...a guy from Aberdeen, we were in San Pedro and loaded gasoline. There I met on the dock at the Texaco office a man from San Francisco who had met my brother. A man from San Francisco who had met my brother. But it was not this that I was going to tell you about... Good boat! Yes, good. No, not those curves! We're going ashore. I smuggled to him a bottle of Calvados. No! Please little boat, not like that. We are going ashore, you know. - *inaudible*! - Ah! Not like that! Take them away! The third boy came and it was white and went to San Francisco. Oh! - But please, Mr. Garbo... - *inaudible*. - Mr. Garbo! - Let's talk about it. Now he sits in Sing-Sing as an emaciated corpse. And I stand here and grieve in my bloodstained shop. But my black boys from Fiji, dear brother they sail the blue Pacific in honor of their parents - *inaudible*! - Mr. Garbo says: "You're crazy!" Please Mr. Garbo, we are your tenants! - *inaudible*! - Tomorrow I'll get the authorities! I think of those days I long for them. They're almost black but they have a happy home Kalle? You may come out now, Kalle. I need some help. Kalle? - Remove the rockets! Remove them! - Kalle, calm down. Kalle. Kalle. Good. Come on, little Kalle and help me. Here. No, he sank. Pull! - This is ludicrous! - Yes, yes... Quiet! I'm in charge here! - Sure, you've got the lady pants. - No! Calm down! We'll rest here until dawn. The wind will probably increase once the sun is up. Everything will surely be okay. Mona, do you mind if I lie here? - In opposite directions? - No, you do that Kalle. Lennart... My little man... Berit, my little woman. I wonder what they are doing up there in the cabin. Yeah, one wonders. Slut! I want revenge! Kalle, we need revenge! - Yes. Do we have to lie like this? - No. I'm coming over. Do you know what I think they are doing right now? You know what I think now, when? But do you know what I think they are doing now then? - Kalle! Bad! - We're just taking revenge, you know. - Lennart and Berit are already at it. - Yes, they have orgies! Come on now! We must get out. Don't idle, lady! Hurry up, lady! Don't use the fork, lady! Ouch! Ouch! Berit! What are you doing? Berit! - Berit! - Yes Kalle, what do you want? - I yearn for you! - What did you say? I yearn for you! Oh, darling! I wish you were here with me! - I want to talk. - In a little while! - How? - What do you mean how? You said you would come ashore in little a while! - How? - Lennart! Lennart, it's for you! - Yes, darling? - Pumpkin, how are you? I'm okay! I've hurt myself in a few places, but except from that, I'm ok! Oh honey, did you hurt yourself? You poor boy! I can't hear you! What did you say? I said: Honey, did you hurt yourself? You poor boy! Yeah, she's fine. It would be fun if you could finally come ashore! Loved one, I want you to be here with me! Well, I see you when I see you! Say hi to Kalle and Walter! Inez says hello! Let me say a few words to the old lady too. Mom? Hi there, dear old lady. Are you allowed to be up this late?

Could the Chief walk under water and steal the fisherman's engine... and then walk to the sailboat, so they can get ashore with the engine. - He would walk?! - Quiet, I'll tell you. - Take this iron... - Ouch! Oops! If the Chief would wear that barrel over his head... Gorgeous! Now sneak quiet and cautious. There went Olsson. Stop that. Stop that! Argh! Ouch! Come out! You haven't got a chance!
