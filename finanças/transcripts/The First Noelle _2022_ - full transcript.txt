Where were the first Christmas cards printed? Where's... Was it New Zealand? Hmm. Terrance? Terrance, we only have a minute. Where are you? Sorry. Those two, they've been trying to steal our crown from the past two years, but it's gonna take a Christmas miracle, Shavonna. Uh... Babe. We need to talk. What's up? You want to talk about the answer? No. No. London. London! Christmas! London... - No, no. - London. Say, hey, babe, that's not what I'm saying. I'm moving to London. Outside. London? Yeah. I mean, I know I've been going back and forth for the board, but today they finally made a counter-offer. Must've been good. Damn good. I'm gonna do it though. I'm gonna head up their new offices in London. That's fantastic. Hmm-hm. I'm really proud of you, babe. Thank you. It's about time they recognize your brilliance. Yeah. Six months apart is... long time. Yeah, but, um... I mean, we can manage. I mean, come on. We've done a whole summer apart before. I mean... Yeah, but that's when you went to your aunt in Dallas, we were eight and not a couple. True. Okay, what about the spring? I mean, I hear Janet will be on tour. Control... Don't bring Janet into this. This is going to be hard. I mean, that's, that's our busiest time of the year... All right, all right. Summer then? You'll come visit me now, right? I don't know. I just got this new position. With our summer releases, campaigns, all eyes are on Ryse Publishing. So... And you know Sabrina has been pulling me left and right... I-I know. I know. This new position is what's gonna get me closer to my imprint, you know? - All of this is for... - The dream. The dream. - I, I know. I got it. - The dream. - Mm-hm. - You're right. What do I always tell you? Oh. If God brought me to it, he equipped me to do it. That's right. So, this is it for us. Yeah. You're doin' it, Noe. We're doin' it. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm Chara Jackson, and this has been our interview with one of Atlanta's rising stars in the world of publishing, Noelle Tucker. So, final word. What is one thing that you would tell our audience about setting goals and fulfilling them? - Wow. - Daddy. I guess I'd say don't give up on them. Don't give up on you. You're gonna have obstacles and distractions, but you also have everything that you need to get through it. And, when things just get a little crazy, you have to duck and dodge a lil.. My bad, girl! We just were... Oh. Hi. We're just gonna step out and make sure... - Get out! - Oh! Sorry. Bye. It's not gonna be on camera, is it? Eh, no. Sandra, you knew this was a big deal. I've been trying to get an interview with Atlanta's Rising Star for months. If our newest client hadn't tweeted about me, I probably still be on the wait list. I know, and look, I kept David Jr. quiet as long as could. Well, maybe next time if you could take away any weapons, I'd really appreciate it. Next time? Hopefully you'll be doin' interviews in your own home. Oh, that was subtle way of telling me my stay is long overdue. No, of course not. We love having you here. - You family. - Right, right! Come on, now. Our home is your home. You know that? Is it safe to come to the kitchen now? - Ooh. - Walk through my own home? Yes, babe. Good morning. - Mmm. No, not today. - You want some breakfast. I got to get to the office early, but it looks great. - You look great. - Whoa! - Good morning. David. Hi. - Oh my! My interview went really well, thank you for asking. Yeah. Until, David Jr. hit her on the side of head with a toy. That's my guy! Oh! So, Noelle, uh, my co-worker Hermin... Mm-mm. No. No. You don't even know what I was gonna say. Is single. Saw a picture of me on your desk, and wants to take me out for dinner. Okay, so, you know exactly what I was gonna say, but he could be the one. Look, you guys have so much in common. Ah-huh. Like what? So, he has books, you have books. He knows how to read, I'm guessin' you know how to read. Look, this could be a match made in heaven. - Indeed. - D-d-don't "indeed" me, okay? Look, you're not putting in the effort and somebody around here has to marry you off. And get me up out of your house? Babe, I-I didn't, I didn't say it this time, she did. - You-you know... - I know, babe. I know. - You did good. - Thank you. You know, I don't remember there being any complaints after I moved into help my sister after her surgery. All that, you could go out and earn a living to actually afford this house. And I thought that you had moved in because they gentrified your neighborhood. Yeah. And then they turned your little studio into a condo, and they hiked up the rent, and then I remember you sayin', "I wish they would," before you moved into Casa Della Turner. - That's what... - Okay, you two. 'Cause she's bringin' up old stuff... Hey, babe. It's okay. - I know. I know. - She messed with me. You know what? Don't even worry. I'm up for another promotion anyway. - Hm. - Mm-hm. And I almost have enough for my own place. So I'll be out of your little mansion soon enough, Scrooge. There is no such thing as a little mansion. I love you... I'mma deal with y'all two later. Okay. All shook up. Keep-keep-keep talkin' to me. - Hey! - Hey. How did the interview go? Well, surprisingly... great. Who would've thought that I'd be that chick on the rise? Uh, me. I'm proud of you. Well, thank you so much for staying up late and helping me prepare for it. You know I always got your back. Look, I was callin' to check in and let you know that a brother's coming back to States for Christmas. Hold on, wait. What? That's great. You know I gotta see my girl. Well, hey. Your girl wants to be seen. I missed you for Thanksgiving. When do you get here? Soon. I got a few more things to wrap up over here, but, um, I'll call you when I have more deets. Okay. Cool. I'm gonna call you later, okay? - All right. - Bye. Eh, hello? Shh! Shh! Shh! Don't! Shh! Uh, so, you got all of this at the farmers' market? - I did. - So then that chicken sausage. - But it smells like pork? - Really? - Science. - Hm... She made me do it. Love you! You deal with all of that. Yep, yep, yep. Oh! - You two are ridiculous! - No, you are. I can't believe you let that man slip through your hands. I didn't let the man get away! He just... It was a mutual decision. To let go of the love of your life? To let go of my best friend, so he can pursue his highest level of bliss. Boo! I gotta go. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning, Maxine. Thank you. Ah-huh. They finally called! Okay, it's the puck. You did that today. Young man? I know that better be a client. Yes. I read your notes three times, and still doesn't make sense. So you want me to cut a whole chapter? Yeah. Because it's redundant. It's like, you're repeating beats to fill pages. - I was drivin' a point home. - Mm-hm. You did drive a point home in chapter six. Chapter six, it was fresh and intriguing. Oh. So you found it intriguing. Do tell, young lady. Do tell. Well, people love the idea of Carla falling in love. They love that cat and mouse game between her and Eugene. But it really slows down in chapter seven. You know, it's, it's time for him to man up, stake his claim. Get his woman. Dragging on so long makes it more about him than her. Wow, you really get him. Mm. I really think I get her. And we already have two books. So, trust me. No, I do. I promise. Hey, uh... Noelle, so... Oh, hi. Deliveries all go to the receptionist, please. Uh, yeah, but this is a special delivery. Oh, my God! Terry! Oh! Mmm-mm! I thought you were gonna come next week. You know, I thought I'd drop in and surprise everyone. Mm-hm. - Besides, I brought some gifts. - Uh-uh. Oh, my gosh! These are your mama's sweet potato cookies? - You already know. - Oh, my God! You're awful! You know I'm on my holiday diet. For what? Besides, since when do you turn down free food? Listen, I had to get me your plate at your house, and in the neighbors house. Yeah, but why do you... Oh, I am so, so sorry! Terrance, this is Vincent Downing. Author of New York Times bestselling series Close Are The Waves. Yeah, yeah. Wow, man. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too, bruh. Uh, thanks for helping my girl get that interview... Ah. No problem. My mom loves your books, bruh. - His momloves my books. - Ah-huh. She's our target audience. And you will love it too once your take my notes. Thanks. Nice meeting you too, man. - And, you too. All right. - All right. - I'll see you later. - Yeah. Okay. Sit, sit, sit! Tell me. Tell me. How was London? How was your flight? - How was the presentation? - Oh, come on. You know your boy killed it. Shoot! I could start two tech companies with all the juice in that room. But I'm telling you, this new app we're developing, it's gonna be a game changer. Okay. I know it will. - I'm so proud of you! - Thank you. So, what's up? How's-how's the fam? How's mom? Well, you know, Sandra and Dave, they're great. But not really enjoying my company. And mama's about to go on her annual Christmas cruise with my auntie, without us. So she's... good. Yeah, mom's gettin' her groove back. Okay, no. We don't talk about that. So, um, how about you? What's new? Reading the next great American novel, or helpin' to write it? Oh. Mm-mm. These, these are all Vincent's. I'm just his support system. But seeing you is the "pick me up" that I needed. I'm glad I could put a smile on your face. I missed you, Noe. Uh... Sorry, one sec. Oh. Yeah, yeah. Um, look, I-I know you're busy. So, I'm gonna get outta here, but, um, I just wanted to stop by and see what you were doin' tonight. Mm, I don't have any plans. Wait. Are you trying to take me to the Kris Kringle Karaoke thing? Uh, no. No, no, no. Because once your hit that stage, there will be nothin' silent or holy about that night. Excuse you! Let's do dinner. - Say 8:00? - Yeah. - That sounds great. - All right. We got a lot of catchin' up to do. - Yeah, we do. - Yeah. It's so good to see you. I'll text you the deets later. - Sounds good. - All right. Thank you for all my gifts, my goodies. Oh, come on now. Anytime. You're just trying to get me thick. Ah, listen, you already got that down thick. - I'll see you later. - Bye. All right. Whoever that was, sign him. He is fine. His picture alone will have books flying off the shelves. That's just Terrance. Best friend turned ex turned best friend again? He looks better than you described. London was definitely good to him. Huh. Well, he brought me some of his mama's famous cookies. Ah, I still have to get into my designer couture dress for my annual holiday party. - No, thank you. - Right. Noelle, I can't thank you enough for helping to coordinate my party this year. I know it's not a part of your job description, but... Are you kidding me? To have the who's who of the publishing world along with Atlanta's most successful black men and women all under one roof... Yes, please! I am so, so honored that you selected me to help you this year. Well, you know how I like to nurture our company's biggest and brightest. And you were the only one in town with no Christmas plan, so. Win-win for all. Right. Yes, ma'am. I'll take what I can. Um... Sabrina. This party is going to be epic! - The guest list is crazy. - Hm. I also heard, uh, Richard from Davenrow and Dale Law will be there. So? Why are you looking at... Don't think I didn't notice the chemistry between you two. Especially at last month's publisher's retreat. Okay? You looked like you were looking for little bit more than legal advice. I've known Richard forever. His firm used to rep me back in the day. And he just had a fresh divorce. Not my idea of a romantic prospect. He's been divorced for two years. I do my research. My dear, you are focused on the wrong kind of hook-up. This is gonna be social. But I've invited some of the hottest up-and-coming writers. A room full of potential acquisitions. Perfect mixture, new money, old money. And most importantly, my money. - And your friends. - Oh. Right. - Ah-huh. - Them too. So, do you want to get together and review the guest list again tonight? Mm-mm. I can't. I have plans. Well, I hope it's a date with that fine Terrance. Hm. We're just friends. All I know is, any man who wants to be just friends... doesn't stop by when he can just call. It is not a date, Sabrina. Okay. Or is it? Okay, so, you got decide if you want to look like chestnuts roasting on an open fire, or mistletoe. What you feelin'? - Chestnuts? Mistletoe? - God! This is totally a date. Look at me. I'm so nervous. - I can't stop shaking. - Why you nervous? I mean, yeah, it's the first time you've seen each other in almost a year, but he's your buddy. - Your pal. Your friend. - Yeah. I don't know, Sandra. Okay? Everything was fine... At least I thought everything was fine. I'm thriving, he's thriving. You know? But then, I saw him, and a whole bunch of feelings that I had... - Did he smell good? - So good. Oh! Girl, that'd do it. Oh. It's just that he has his whole new swag. You know? And then he asked me to go to dinner with him tonight. I swear I heard something in his voice. What if he asked me to go back to London with him again? I say, don't make the same mistake twice. What am I gonna do, mare? Now, if you go with mistletoe, you can put this hair here, and then you already ready for the come in. You know what I'm sayin'? You know what I'm sayin... Girl! - Hi. - Hi. Wow. You, ah, look amazing. Oh. I do? Thank you. Thanks for coming. - Thanks for inviting me. - No problem. Thanks for coming. You don't look too bad yourself. Thank you. Well, before we order, I... Actually, before you go on, can I just say something real fast? - Okay, uh... - Oh, hi. I'm so sorry. We're not ready to order yet. Thank you. No. No, she's not the waitress. Noelle, this is my girlfriend. Hi. - Girlfriend? - Yeah. You know, fun fact, her name is Noelle too. She goes by Elle. Yeah. That's really crazy. - I'm a hugger. - Okay! It's so nice to finally meet you. I've heard so much about you. I hope you don't mind me crashing your little reunion. - Oh, I-i-it's cool. Right, Noe? - Mm-hm. It's totally cool. Don't be silly. Sit! - It's hot. - Ooh! Yeah. Everything all right? Yeah. I love your dress. She's so pretty, babe. Yeah. - No, he didn't! - He did. How does she look? - I don't know. Ghastly. - Ooh! That pretty, huh? What did I do to deserve this? I've been a good girl all year! Well, don't throw in the towel yet. Santa may still be on your side. This could be a fling or something. You don't know. Just go and enjoy dinner. It won't be that bad. Please. You live 30 minutes from each other all this time, but had to move half way across the world... to find each other. - Crazy, right? - So crazy. Would you believe it took him an entire month to call me after the party? Playin' hard to get. But I had no choice but to say yes, because who could say no to a Janet Jackson concert? I'm sorry. Excuse me. Did you say Janet Jackson? You love Janet Jackson too? She is my favorite. Have you ever seen her perform live? No, but I'm a huge fan. I mean, huge, huge! You know? I came close once. - I guess I missed my chance. - That's awful. Mm-hm. Yeah. My best friend took someone else. Oh, that's rude. I'd like to think so. What are your thoughts, Terrance? Uh... I mean, no need in dwelling in the past, right? I mean, where's the Christmas spirit in that, Noelle? - So, Elle, are you still in PR? - Oh, no. I'm an influencer now. I felt like I wanted me to do somethin' different with my life. Influencer, em, Insta-model? - Come on, Noe. - Oh. That's one aspect of it, but it's so much more. I'm also an author. I like to encourage, inspire women to get more out of their life that they're livin'. - So you're a life coach, too? - Mm-hm. - Influencer, life coach. Huh. - Mm-hm. - Lucrative? - Actually, yeah. I mean, Elle has thousands of followers. She's just shy of a million. Babe, enough about me. So, Terrance tells me you're also an editor. Mm-hm. Senior editor at Ryse Publishing. Ryse? I love them. I self-published my first book, but I'm familiar with the company. - Mm. - Yeah. Maybe you've heard of it. The Art Of The Elevation, Unlock and Unleash. Hmm? No. I don't think so. Never heard of it. - Huh. - Uh-uh, you will. Seein' it's about to be a best-seller. - Babe! - Well, is that right? That's cute. Oh. You're in luck. I have a copy just for you. Oh. Wow! You walk around with autographed copies of your book? For my man's best-friend, of course. I mean, really, you're the only thing he talks about. To be honest, I'd probably be jealous if you weren't like his sister. - I hate her. - Rightfully so. She goes by Elle. Oh, her name is Noelle. He's literally dating me, but not. It don't take a degree in psychology to see how crazy this is. Eh, he's clearly still in love with you. No, he's not. It's a coincidence. This is crazy. Like "TV movie thriller" crazy. It's over. It's official. He's moved on. It was official when you broke up with him last year. That was mutual. So you did the right thing? I thought so. And I saw them together... I just thought that when the time was right, when both of our careers settled... That he was ready then? You took a gamble, sis. I know. I lost my, my man and my best friend. This is gonna be the worst Christmas ever! Nah. Not until she has a ring on her finger, or a baby in the oven, I say you fight. You want him back? Then go for it. She can't out-Noelle you. You're the real Noelle. The OG Noelle. The first Neolle. It's time to put No-Elle in her place. Maybe you're right. Maybe him dating this fake Noelle is a call for help. SOS. You heard? I say, we stuff-up a chimney, and send her packin' on a reindeer. - You're bad. - I know! They mess with my baby sister. I can't have that. Come here. Mmm. Now go get your man back. What is she talkin' about? So... how was your dinner with Terrance? - Ah, fine. - Oh. Until he introduced me to his new girlfriend. Oh. From London? Was she white? No. - She was a Noelle. - You lost me. He's dating this new chick named Elle Carter... Carper... W-wait. Elle Carver. The Elle Carver? - I love her. - Oh. - Her book changed my life. - Really? Well, it isn't the Bible, but the way she encourages women to unlock and unleash... Definitely the edge I needed to buy Miller And House Publishing out. That's the gamble that still pays. Wow. I guess she's the real deal. "Recalibrate your mind to focus more on your I cans and I wills, rather than your I thinks and I wishes." Excuse me? It's in the book. Right. Just started glancing over it this morning. Oh, it's a hit. Was on several book club lists. She's an international brand. And this is just the beginning. She's on the verge of becoming a young Oprah and lyanla all in one. I know she's from here, relocated to London, but if she did something States side... she'd dominate the self-help market. - Dominate? Really? - Yeah. Well, she did say something about publishing a second book, and hiring an actual publishing house to help her. Hm. Think I could bring her in? Oh, I'm sure she's meeting with every major pub... Every major? We are standing in every major. And you are every woman! And Ryse... needs women like her. Mm. I got chills. Noelle, this could be the Christmas miracle you've been waiting for. You bring her on and I guarantee you the board will be running to give you your own imprint. We sign her before my big Christmas party, that promotion's as good as yours. ♪ This is why you can't go Christmas caroling with us ♪♪ Come on, baby. Let me, let me put the sauce on it. - Mm-mm. - Y'all-y'all need me. - Babe... - You-you need me to lead this. Just sing the song like everybody's sing... Wait a minute! Okay! Yep! That's the one. Huh! What? Aahh! Yep! That's the one! - What's-what's the one? - Tsk. That's my sister right there. Isn't your son somewhere crying? Isn't that your biological clock ticking? - David! - It's loud. She started it. Why are you so dolled up? Ah... Do you have a date? Calm down. It's not a date... yet. This is for Terrance. Doesn't he have a hot new girlfriend? You know I tell him everything. But nobody said "hot." Why are you dressed up for him? She's winnin' him back. This girl is gonna have that man in her stocking by Christmas Eve. - Leave it alone. - I had him first. She has him now. Leave it alone. - Why? He's mine. - He doesn't seem to know it. Hence, the dress. So you're going to manipulate him to falling back in love with you? No. I've had him since jungle gyms and hopscotch, so... And she's had his heart since you dropped him, what, this time last year. It was a mutual break, David! - It's just a dress. - It's just a dress. - She's the worst. - She's so the worst. I thought she was a black entrepreneur on the rise like yourself, and don't you have the same name? Isn't it, what... Just like some self-destruction type stuff. Ignore him. You look amazing. Maybe David's right. - What am I doing? - Wait. Can you say that again but slower? - I want to record it. - Stop. The real question is, what do you want? - Oh, hey. - Wow! Uh, I'm sorry. I-I mean... Uh... Wow! - Thank you. - No, thank you. Thanks. Uh, see the dress works. Yes, ma'am. So, what's the occasion? Nothing. I just felt like, um, you know, just... Wait. Do we have an appointment that I missed? Oh. No. I just, stopping by to see if you read my most recent draft. Oh. Yes. I started it. Not done yet. But it's in really, really good shape. Thank you. You know, I couldn't have did it without you. Your notes and your thoughts on Eugene really opened this thing up for me. Well, good. You know, him hiding behind his job and emotions instead of pursuing Carla was the wake up call I needed. Hm. Right? That's wonderful. Noelle... I'd like to take you out. Um... Out? Vincent. Thank you. I'm, I'm very flattered. But you're my client. You know? Sabrina would never approve. She's your boss, not your mama. I work here. Excuse me. - Oh. Sorry. - Hm. So... You're saying no because I'm a client? Yes. N-no. Wait. Wait. No. Yes. I just don't think it's a good idea. To go to a little dinner? A movie? Cup of coffee? I just think that we should keep things professional between these four walls. - Is that cool? - Yeah. Cool. Whatever you want, Noelle. Looks like I have a lot of writing to do anyway, right? Yeah. Oh. I'm so sorry. Do you think that we can pick this up tomorrow? Oh, yeah. Tomorrow. Sure. Yeah. - Thank you so much for coming. - Hey, no problem. - I'll talk to you... - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow. Yeah. - Yes. Yeah. Hey. Uh, yeah. It's good to hear from you too. I just want you to know that I heard you, and I'm willing to try. I really want my best friend back. Do you think that you can come over to the office this afternoon so we can talk some more about it? I'm doing a taste test for Sabrina's annual Christmas party and Chef Jake is gonna be here in the afternoon, so we could... Great! Great. It's great. Yeah. Cool. See you soon. Mmm. Chef Jake... this is amazing. That's coconut cobbler bite. Wow! Thank you. I appreciate that. It normally does leave the ladies with a smile. But, uh, how's it for you, my man? - It's all right. - Okay. Well, maybe I'll do better when you guys hire me to cater your wedding. Oh! Well, actually, we're, um... Mm-mm. We're not together. I'm single. Very single. And open. I don't... Not open, as in, the bites, Chef Jake. Wait, wait. You single in that dress? You know, I'm sorry. I hope that wasn't too unprofessional. Very. No. That's fine. Thank you. It's nice to be appreciated. I should be apologizing to you, the way I've been drooling over these crab puffs. And a man like you, single... cooking all of this. Yeah. It's rough out here in these streets, but I've been a good boy and hopefully Santa'll stuff a little somethin', somethin' in my stocking this year. Oh. - Or someone. - Ah! I like that. Now I got to revise my letter to the North Pole. How you spell your name again? Hey, you know... Should I leave? Oh, Terrance, you're still here? Really? Tell you what. I'm gonna get you guys some sample menu to finalize everything, a few more samples. I'm just gonna run down to my truck, okay? - Mm. - All right? I'll be right back. What? And please, if anything comes to mind, just let me know. Okay? 'Cause I can tweak, twist and adjust the menu to whatever you like to suit your personal needs. - Mm-hm. Thank you. - Ah, no problem. - I will be calling you. - Okay. All right. - Mm-hm. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas to you too. - Feliz Navidad! - Ha-Happy Hanukkah. - Oh. Happy Kwanzaa. - Happy Kwanzaa to you too. What's up with you, Grinch? He was so busy flirting with you that you didn't even finalize Sabrina's menu. It's okay. I can always call him back down here. He's not even your type. And how would you know? First-hand knowledge. Well, maybe I'm ready to try something new. Babe, really? I almost got a residence in Thailand. That's why you did get a residence in Chicago. - It's my love language. - It was worth it. I guess he said no to the dress. Got her. Didn't I? - No. - Come on. Oh! - Go. - Why do I have to go? Your mouth. You gonna tell me anyway. What happened? Tell me everything. He said that he was thinking about coming back home. Okay. And she's thinking about coming back with him. And then, Sabrina told me that she wants me to sign her, and if I do, then I'll get promoted. Wow! So what do you want? - I want the promotion. - Mm-hm. - And the man. - Mm-hm. So, meet with her! What? But how? I thought we hated her. Now, how're we supposed to help her? She'll be helping you. You gotta keep your enemies close. The pretty ones, even closer. Is that a saying? When they look like her, yes. Besides, you can find out what makes her tick, and then you'll know how to destroy her. You mean, how to destroy their relationship? I said, what I meant to say. You are too into this. Just committed to the plan. And bored out of my mind working from home. So, are we gonna take this up a notch? Elle. Elle Carver! - It is so nice to meet you. - Thank you. When I found out that you and Noelle were friends, I knew this was kismet. Your book is truly brilliant. Seriously, we need more black girl magic in the world of literature. Thank you, Sabrina. Honestly, I'm just happy to be here! I mean, talk about black girl magic, look at you! I've been following your career for years. You're a B. You're too kind. - Please, have a seat. - All right. Now, don't judge me. My assistant went to go grab my book, then you can give me an autograph. I got you, girl! I was telling Elle how much of a game changer you've been in this industry. And, with you coming back to the States to re-brand, there's no better place than Ryse. I've seen first-hand how you move and inspire women. It's time. It's time that you start empowering them. Sis, white women have had the motivational genre on lock for years. It time we start making some moves. Shake things up. Okay, ladies. You all got my attention. So, I was thinking... That's a quick turnaround time. Do you really think we'll be able to get that proposal back to Sabrina before Christmas? Oh, absolutely. I do them in my sleep. Together, we can have 'em by the Christmas party deadline, and have it drafted by the top of the year. - You were brilliant in there. - What? Me? No, no, no. - That is Sabrina. - No. I loved her idea to announce our partnership at the Christmas party, but it was you that sold me. You passion for positively impacting the lives of women, also the fact that you want to do a five book series... Oh, no, no, no! But it was you! You! You had that idea for the live podcast by women inspired by your book. And it was your idea to get us sponsorship so that way, we can do a HBCU college tour and have a scholarship for aspiring black writers. You're forgetting that you're the one that said to document it so we can use it as a marketing tool for the launch. Ah... You are brilliant. I love how you understand my brand, my vision... me. Yeah. Yeah, I do, huh. I mean, I learned a lot about you today. About your impact. How you've helped so many women. It's really beautiful. I believe in you, Elle. Thanks so much. That means a lot. I can't wait to tell Terrance we're besties too! Special delivery. You really should consider delivery as your second job. Hey, look, I can make banker on holidays. Exactly. What're you doin' here? Oh, Elle told me you were working late, so, here I am. And the flowers? Yeah, she said that she met with her attorney and she signed up with you guys. - What? - Yeah. Wait, I'm sorry. Did I ruin a surprise? No! That's fine. - It's fine! - Okay. Congratulations. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Um, so, where is Elle, to tell me how worthy I am of worship? Well, I mean, she wanted to have them delivered, but I told her roses were your favorite and thought why not deliver 'em myself. Right. - That's really sweet. - No problem. Well... Ah, since you are here, you have no plans tonight? No. Why? What're you thinkin'? ♪ Silent night ♪ Holy night ♪ All is calm ♪ And all is bright... Yo, can you believe they still did a midnight Christmas movie marathons down at the old theater? Can you believe there is still dollar? - Are you serious? - Mm-hm. Wow! That didn't stop us from sneaking in there in the eighth grade though. That's right. That's because you were a bad influence on me. Me? I was the... You were the one using me to make, uh, Antoine Bell jealous. Don't act like you don't remember his name. I was not. I just wanted a nice night out at the movies for Christmas and... I used you, okay? But it didn't work. So... - You sucked! - Whatever! Thank you. So tell me somethin'... why isn't there anyone that I'm making jealous about being here tonight? I mean, where's your boy Chef Jake? He can't bake cookies? That's so funny. It's none of your business. All right. You've been datin' since we... Yep. I've... dated. Been dating. When I have time. Right. Your MO. Surprised you even had time to start a relationship with me, let alone anyone. Wow. Is that where we're goin' tonight? Don't act like I didn't rock your world for two years. You're right. You did. What? Are you serious? No. Still, you-you've seen this like a hundred times. Shut up. Everyone cries at this movie. Stop laughing. It's not... What? I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, let me, let me help you get your tears. Yeah, yeah, You're always teasing me. Why do you do... - Oh. Ah. - Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry! Here, give it to me. I'm sure David has something dry you can change into. It's all good. ♪ Way heavy on the heart Here. ♪ It's melancholy - Um, should I go back... - Oh, no, no, no. I got it. In front of Baby Jesus? We were just trying to see a movie and then we had some cookies but it's not really what I tried... It was an accident. Mm-hmm. Somebody had a good time. Stop. I'll tell you about it tomorrow. Go to bed. No! You gotta give me something. It was good, okay? It was, it was great, actually. So was his chest. Mm. Why you look so sad? I don't know. Girl, this is everything. Do you think it will work? What? With this marketing plan, it has to. We need to talk. - This sounds serious. - It is. So, do you wanna tell me, or do I have to ask you? - Ask what? - Who is he? Who's-who's who? The man that put that's making you smile. I see you glowing. Your outfit, you're just covered in with tight clothes, you're looking good, smelling good, all day. Come on. Tell me. - Who is he? - Hey. Oh, sorry. I didn't know you were in a meeting. Hi. Sorry, I had a meeting with the marketing team, so I figured I'd pop in. - Mm. - Is it a bad time? No, no, I'm really glad that you dropped by. Elle Carver, Vincent Downing. Nice to meet you. - The Elle Carver? - Yes. - Pleasure to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - I love your work. - Thank you. - Yes, ma'am. - I'll be right with you. Um... I got some news. Uh-oh. I loved your draft. I think you're done, my friend. - Ohh. - Mm-hmm. - So no more notes? - No more notes! - No more red marks? - No more red marks. Oh, how much I love those red marks. I know you ha... No, it's-it's amazing, Vincent. This is probably some of your best work. That's great. Thank you! No problem. Is there anything else I can help you with right now? - Huh? - Anything else right now? Oh, no. I'll let you two get on with it. Mm. - Get some rest. - I will. - No more 3:00 a.m. texts. - No more. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye-bye. - That's him, right? - What? Vincent? - Yes! - You think Vincent is the guy? - Yes! Wait. There's-there's no guy. Um, but he's just one of our best-selling authors, you know? Like you're about to be, girl. So let's get back to work. And speaking of that, I have a mock up with a little something, something. I know you're not done with your book just yet, but I was hoping this could be some inspiration. El, how did you find the time? Ah. It was already swirling around in my head. You wrote this about me? About my book? - Yeah. It was nothing. - No. This is something. Girl, I'm not doing this with you today. - What? What's happening? - That's it! - We gotta celebrate. - Celebrate? Our union. Our partnership. Sisters leveling up together! Terrance already had his good time with you. Now, it's my turn. Grab your bag. Let's go. Come on. Come on. You have to remember some of his exes. I mean, tell me how they were. Did you all get along? Um... we got along well enough. Ah... When I first met him, I couldn't believe he was single. I mean, you gotta be honest, I know that's your boy, but, sis, he is fine. I mean, he's all right. He's the total package. You gotta be a fool to let him go. Or a confused, complicated soul. - What about you and your exes? - I didn't have many. But my dad, he was intimidating to them. I did hide one boyfriend. I was with him the longest. Was he the love of your life? No, he put me down a lot. Made me feel next to nothing. But I stayed with him because part of me believed it was true. He was the inspiration behind my book. Encouraging woman, motivating woman to know their self-worth no matter who they're with, because I had to. And then I met Terrance. He changed everything for me. He too was hurt and wounded after his ex... Hurt and wounded? It took a lot for him to trust me with his heart after all he had been through. Yeah. I'm sure. But he did, and here we are. I mean, who actually gets to meet and be with the love of their life? Yeah, who. - Hey. - Hey. Where's Sandra? Knocked out sleep from Christmas shopping. So, best time for me to wrap her gift. How was your eve? Is your diabolical plan of destroy Black love working? Oh, come on. No comeback? She loves him. Like, really loves him. And, you do too, right? Yeah. And the worst part is... I like her. Like, legitimately I would hang with her. Mm. I don't even know what I'm doing anymore. I mean, why do I have to give up everything that I want for her? But isn't she's kinda giving you what you really want? Her signing at Ryse absolutely solidifies your imprint. And isn't that the dream? Yeah. But why can't I have the dream, and the man? Why, why do women always have to choose? You wanna know what I think? You know how she feels about him. You know how you feel about him. And you're kindly clear on how he feels about her. But what you seem to be quite unclear on is how he feels about you. Figure that out, and maybe all of this will make some sense. Aw, I hate when you're right. Then you hate often. - A live podcast. - Oh, my God. That would be so good. Then we can do market in dollars. - Right. - Scholarships. - For HPCU. - Yes. - For aspiring writers. - That's it, Black writers. - Black aspiring writers! - Yes! Babe, what are you doing here? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. - I'm not gonna be here long. - Yeah, yeah. What're you doing here? We have a deadline to catch. - Okay. - Yeah, babe. - We're working. - All right, look, I'm not... Noe, would you mind if I get the room for a second? Can y'all take a quick break? Sure. Thank you. - Do you want anything? - No, I'm good. - Thank you. - Okay. We present an update to Sabrina in an hour. She wants us to do a pre-presentation before the board. I'm super nervous. I don't know if we're gonna do good, baby. - I'm so scared. - Okay. Okay. Just calm down. - I'm so nervous. - All right, all right. That's why I'm here. Breathe. Just relax. All right. Yes. Calm down. I'm here. Now why are you here? Because I'm worthy and I deserve this. I'm sorry, I-I didn't hear you. Because I'm worthy and I deserve this. You know, I'mma little hard at hearing so... Baby, because I'm worthy and I deserve this! That's what I'm talking about. Look, I know you've had some disappointments in the past. And that's why you self-published. But, Noelle is good people. - She is. Mm-hmm. - She believes in you. - She's got your back. - Yes, she does. I got your back. You're gonna do great, you hear me? Yes. You will not fail. Thank you, babe. I won't let you. What else? If God brought me to it, he equipped me to do it. That's right. - I love you, woman. - I love you too, Ter Bear. - How much you love me? - I love you! How much? Mm. So, what's the problem? His family's annual pre-Christmas dinner is perfect! - His mom loves you. - This is a mess. Pretending like we're still bro and sis. Elle will definitely catch on. His parents will be chill. Mm, once his mama found out we were dating, she started sending me fresh knitted baby clothes for our future babies. I don't see the problem. So what if Elle finds out? She would be devastated and she'll leave him. Mm. And me. Okay, now I'm really confused. You're talking about that deal with Ryse, the one that has you on the rise? Well, she's my friend now. And she's helping me. I'm helping her... I don't know. This is a mess. All right, so you're also his best friend. So if you don't show, it's gonna look suspicious. So, what are you gonna to do? I know. I know. I look good. And no pictures. Because I charge it. - Ohh! - Ah! Whoo-whee, look at you. Make yourself useful. Make yourself useful. Make yourself useful. Oh, you look ravishing. Ohh, give me a spin, give me a spin, give me a spin. Ooh, they gonna need some theme music when you walk in. - Hey... - Mm-hmm-hmm. Thank you for going to this drab of a Christmas party with me. Thank Noelle for baby-sitting so I could go with you. I'll do no such thing. She lives here rent free. So this is her duty. Shut up. You know I love giving you two a chance to bask in your love. Thanks, sis. Oh. Give me this. Mm, let's get out of here looking all fine with this animal. Damn. ♪ Looking through photographs ♪ All the ghosts from Christmas past ♪ ♪ Weigh heavy on the heart Oh, my God! ♪ It's melancholy Aww! Wow. That's crazy. ♪ Than boughs of holly ♪ I look forward to the time ♪ That we could all be put together ♪ ♪ Maybe I'll enjoy December Mm. Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. Hi! Hi! Welcome. Oh, I'm good. Hey, hey, look who's here. - And she brought cake. - There's my girl! My love! My daughter is finally here. You look beautiful. Don't start to do all this stuff... Hush. I can greet my daughter if I want to. You ended things with her. Not me. It smells so good in here. But, where's Elle? I thought that she'd be helping. - What? - Oh, you mean the queen vegan? She threw out my chitlins 'cause she thought it was molded food, then she tried to put Brussel sprouts in my greens. Oh, come on, ma. You know she was just trying to help... Well, there ain't no trying or experimenting in my kitchen. It's Christmas. In here messing around with my... We wouldn't want that. So where's Elle? In the den with my dad. Where it's safe. Oh, okay, let me go ahead and say hello. No, what you need to do is throw on that apron and help me finish up in here. But, ma, I thought you just said that there was no nobody touching nothing up in your kitchen. No, I said she can't touch nothing up in my kitchen. And you know who she is. You know... Hey. There you are. I see much hasn't changed in here. Yeah. You know mom can't let go of this room. Mm. Hey, um, now, you've been so busy with Elle... we never really had a chance to talk about our movie date. Date? Yeah. It got... real. - Look, if I crossed any lines... - No. It's fine. I didn't take it any kind of way. I mean, you were just comforting me, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, right. Right. So, um... FYI, my mom has already agreed that she's not gonna talk about, you know... Oh. Uh-huh. Mention that I'm the best thing that's happened to you since sliced bread and caller ID? I mean, this, this is your home. Wherever Elle is, it's my home. Oh. So, now your home is wherever your girlfriend is. - That's new. - Look, don't go there, Noe. - I'm just saying... - What are you saying? I mean, what does it even matter to you? - Well, maybe it's because... - Hey, you two. - Hey. - In here having fun without me? - Just catching up. - I think dinner's ready. And, your mom said I can't go into the kitchen without... An escort? Protection. Come on. So, Noelle, how's everything at Ryse? It's great... thanks to Elle. No, thanks to Noelle. We have a meeting with the board tomorrow to finalize things. In less than a week, Noelle built out a whole marketing plan to help promote my new book, and it's not even done. Yeah, these two are really shaking things up over there. Mm, and seeing that I haven't read your first book, and don't plan on it, you wanna tell us what the second one is about? Well, the first book is about helping women unleash and unlock for success. And the next one is about women unleashing and unlocking for love. Interesting. And you have a lot of expertise in this area? Unleashing in love? Mary... - What? - Come on, ma. It's gonna be really good. Mm-hmm. And I think it's gonna be a huge game changer for Black authors in the self-help space. And, hopefully, it's gonna be big for you. I've been watching you work so hard since you were a little girl. Maybe we're just proud. You, uh, deserve a little happiness. - Thank you. - Here, here. Cheers to Noelle. Yes, cheers. To the both of them. You're my two special ladies. Well, this is beautiful being able to celebrate you like this, babe. With my family. I can only hope and pray that this is the first of many more holidays together. Oh, sweetie, I feel the same. I love you so much, Ter Bear. I love you too. Oh, all right, all right, can we clear the table? So we can pull the desserts out. Don't worry about it, Elle. I-I'll get it. Just... I-I'll get it. No, wait. Hey, where're you going? No. No, wait, wait. Where're you going? No, the coat, I cannot stay here. What's wrong? Hey. Hey, look, it's gonna be okay. Whatever it is. I'm-I'm right here. Wait, wait, wait, wait. - Noe, we can't... - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, wait, I'm not, I'm not sorry. I'm confused. Why didn't you choose me? Why couldn't you choose me? So that's it? You're using her to hurt me? - No. I'm with her because... - Because? Why are we talking about this, Noelle? Because we never talk about this. Through all the laughs and smiles... we've never discussed why we couldn't make it all the way. We never discussed why you going and staying in London was the biggest mistake. Hell, you even rebounded with a fake Noelle. You told me to go! - New beginnings, remember? - No, it's... I was just trying to be supportive. Hold you down. That's what we do, right? Dammit, Terrance. Are you blind? Like, are you blind? I'm still in love with you. I jus... And what happened the other night... Look, look, look, Noe, Noe... I'm sorry if I led you on. I just missed my friend. And-and... And? Please stop. Please stop. Just tell your parents I was sick. Noelle. So, once the outline is complete, on page six you'll see our prelaunch plan. She'll tackle a chapter teaser each week to get the buzz going, hopefully get some new trending topics and new followers to pre-order the book before it even sells. This is wonderful. Really. I think I speak for all of us when I say this is impressive. Elle, is there anything you'd like to add? No. Oh... okay, well, we'll give these numbers a closer look, but I'm good with all of this. And you made the Christmas deadline. All thanks to Elle. We actually make a really great team. Yes. We actually did. Excuse me. Well... Excuse me, Sabrina. Excuse me, everyone. Elle? Elle, hello? Where're you going? Elle, stop! What's going on? - You're her, aren't you? - Her who? What are you talk... Don't act like I'm an idiot. I overheard your whole conversation last night while I was in the kitchen. - Elle, I don't know... - You're the ex. - The one that broke his heart. - I am. But I thought you found a man of your own. I didn't realize you were still in love with mine. - Elle, I'm so sorry. - Sorry for what? Sorry for pretending to be my friend? Sorry for acting like you saw something in me? I do! I do see something in you. And we are friends, Elle! I wanna help. You saw a come up. An opportunity and a fool. Some friend. Goodbye, Noelle. Elle. But, Elle... Elle! Noelle. I need to see you. Now. Sabrina, I'm so sorry. Is everything okay between you two? - Yes. Absolutely. - Well, I hope so. Because the board was impressed and they're ready to move. This is big for everyone. Especially you. I know. I promise. Everything will be fine. Well, I'm not so sure about that. Noelle, you are an amazing junior executive, but I draw the line when you interfere in people's personal lives and bring it into the office. Honestly, I didn't think it would get this far... So, it was you? You had Richard call and ask me out? Wait. Richard? What? He called you? Yes. He called me before the meeting. - You didn't know? - No. I had no idea. Can you believe that? Before he even had a chance to see me in my two sizes down designer couture dress, he asked me out. That's great. I'm petrified. Don't give me those Bambi eyes. I don't do this. I don't date. I work. I build. I strategize. I achieve. I don't... date. Okay, then, don't go. I can't. Why not? Because... I like him. And no one should be alone on Christmas. You're right. I don't have it all... but I would like a little bit of whatever this is. Well, then, relax and be you. It's who he's interested in. But, but how do I know? Noelle, I can't tell you how long it's been since I've dated. And love... even longer than that. You... you could do this. You just have to surrender yourself to the moment. Open yourself up to the opportunity. He's making his intentions clear. - That's half the battle. - You make it sound so easy. Because it is. You just have to take it day by day. And, if it's for you, love will come and find you. You can't force anyone to love you. Just open your eyes and listen with your heart. You'll know if it's real... and you'll know what you have to do. Oh... Where are you going? I just figured out what I have to do. Well, don't be late to the venue for the party! You know I don't deal with caterers! - Hey. Come on in. - Hey. - How are you? - I'm good. How are you? - Noelle? - Right here. - Hey. - Hey. I'm sorry I was ignoring your calls. But I see you got my message? You talk to her yet? She left my parents' house right after you. She's staying at a hotel. So... no surprise she spazzed out after your meeting. She's mad, mad. Can you blame her? I should have told her the truth. Why didn't you? No, I didn't want her to be uncomfortable, you know. I didn't want her to have to worry about... Worry about what? I thought she was the one, Noelle. I hurt somebody that has done nothing but put me first. My wants, my needs... So, she caters to you? - No. - Got it. She sacrifices for me. We want the same things at the same time. We were talking marriage in a year, and kids after that... Really? Even with her career on the rise? Yes. Even with all of that, a life with me was never a second thought. We wanna be together more than anything. I wanted it to work, Terrance. Right. Not more than you wanted your career. And that's fine, I know. But I'm in a different place now. So am I. Hi. Ooh. - Everyone's here. - Mm-hmm. - But, of course. - Including Richard. Oh, I saw. Ooh. Oh, I'm so nervous. I'm so... - Do I look nervous? - Uh-huh. No, no, no. You look fabulous.. Thank you. Oh! Congratulations. For what? You haven't checked your email? It's been confirmed. You've been green-lit to start your own imprint. Sabrina, seriously? Oh, my gosh! Yes! Yes! Oh, my gosh! Which writer will you sign first? I don't know. I can sign writers now. Oh, my gosh! Mm, I have an idea. - Thank you so much. That mean... - Hi, Tenese. Hi, how are you? Could I speak with her? Yes. - Elle, you look... - Don't. I'm only here at the advisement of my attorney. Wanted to make sure things are copasetic while he works on getting out of my contract at Ryse. - Elle, please reconsider. - Why? Your job depends on it? No. Forget my job. You know what, do what you want with Ryse. I worked really hard to get here, and if I have to do it again from scratch, I will. But getting there is never really there, you know, if you don't remember the lessons along the way that will keep you there. You finally read my book? Elle, I'm so sorry for everything. I know I did a lot of things wrong. Yes. But the one thing I did do right, was elevate and push you to elevate your platform. And your voice deserves to be heard. Because I really, truly believe in you. I don't get you, Noelle. I don't. Not even after the 20 messages I left you? Twenty six. Right. What is he doing here? - He's here for you. - No. I don't wanna be a part of your little games. No more games. No more lies. He is my very best friend. And you are what's best for him. I thought I wanted what we had back, but I'm wrong. So, now you don't love him? I've known him forever. So I will always love him. But he's in love with you. I don't know what to believe. That's fair. At least go listen for yourself. Time to unlock and unleash the love. When we were kids, we used to lay down at the bottom of the tree at my parent's house and look up at the lights. Yeah. That was my favorite thing to do on Christmas day. You two gonna be okay? Yeah. I think so. We still got a lot of talking to do, but whatever you said helped. Just told the truth, for once. Hey, look, Noelle, um... You don't have to say it. I love you. All right, I always will. And I would never trade what we have for anything. Good. 'Cause I love you back, and thank you. For what? You letting me go last year... it was the release I didn't know I needed so I can grow and go after the things I really wanted at the time. And that doesn't mean I don't want love. - No. - Mm. I just want a love that wants me back. I want at the right time, the right place, with the right one. That's deep. That is an excerpt from your girl's book. Anyway, you deserve love, Noelle. And you'll find it. - It just ain't with the chef. - Oh, there you go again. Not minding your business. Hey, uh, Elle's gonna stay at Ryse, too. - Really? Why? - Yeah. I talked to her. And you got my back. I got yours. - Thank you. - No problem. - I'll talk to you later. - Okay. May I have this dance? Wow. All of this from a man, and I can't even get to get dressed up for his own book. Hey, photoshoots are soft. I stand by that. Mm-hmm. - You look very nice, sir. - Thank you. And you look... exquisite. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. So, who's the lucky escort tonight? Mm, this designer bag, with the tag tucked in, and some celebratory champagne. Celebratory? - I got my own imprint. - Wha-a-at? Finally, finally-finally, I get to publish books that I want, you know, promote new voices and writers, and tell the stories I really wanna tell. That is amazing. - And so well deserved. - Thank you. So, how long do I have to wait for you to offer me a deal at this new mystery imprint? Not a joke, Vincent. I'm not joking. Well, you know I can't afford you. I don't care. - You're crazy. - Yes, I am. For you. Even after I... Made a huge mistake by turning me down? Mm. Well, that could be easily rectified, Noelle. Ahem, uh, Vincent... will you go out with me? - Mm. I don't know. - Oh, my God. You already know. Noelle, you've been my Carla since chapter three of my second book. Oh, my goodness. That was corny, but probably the most romantic thing anyone has ever said to me. Maybe that's because Eugene is tired of running from what he really wants. And just may decide to ask for Carla's hand by chapter nine? Mm, well, Carla might be inclined, depends on what happens in chapter ten.

Come on, sit down, I got gifts. - Okay. - I'll be right back, okay? - Here you go. - Let's see. Let's see. - Brother-in-law. - All right, all right. - All right. - Right next to me. Okay.

Okay, so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give you your gift. Oh, yes, I'm going to help you start packing now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here you go. Oh. Oh, I thought I was gonna turn off the Wi-Fi to get you out of here. - Forget him. - I'm gonna do it. - I am so proud of you. - Thank you. - You did it. - I did. - You did. - Got my own imprint! - Yes! - Ya! I love it! - Thank you so much. - Ohh, it was nothing. - Wait, was he kidding? - Uh-huh. He, I don't want him touching my stuff, you know. David, don't touch my stuff!
