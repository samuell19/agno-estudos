You should fear what I can do! Don't tell me what to do, lummox! Get up! Whatever happened to you when I was in town, for God's sakes, it's not worth killing yourself over! [ Sobbing ] She said she was my friend. She was surprised, and then -- and then she saw what I really was. She saw what I truly am. And she fled. I should have known it was a woman. You're not the first one to go mad over a broken heart, Anton. Nor will you be the last. All my life I have been betrayed. Always. Always. No such thing. A child is always a child until he becomes a boy, and then a man and then a corpse. Take it from an old gravedigger on that. She said I have no future. Will you wake up tomorrow? Will something happen then? That's the future. Happens whether we think it will or not. Oh, my God. I'm sorry! Why? Didn't that hurt? Where you cut yourself? No, I didn't cut myself. I stabbed myself! I'd think you were drunk already if I hadn't drained the last drop myself yesterday. You don't believe me? No, but when a man loves a woman and then... I just think you're not thinking straight is all. Do you know much about women? Well, yes. Well, not as much as some. What kind of question is that? I don't know. How many kinds of questions are there? You were right about me. I was a priest, long ago. A lifetime ago. I was happier then, until I met a woman. Had you not met women before? No. This woman in particular. Oh. A married woman at that. The father hired her on to clean the church. She wasn't a real beauty, Anton, but her heart, so kind and pure and nothing but love for this whole rotten world. We talked, and she laughed. Oh, that laugh. Hers was a marriage of convenience, though not that convenient for me. I loved her. I didn't want to. I tried not to, but it happened all the same. Did she love you in return? She did. So I abandoned everything I ever believed in, this whole life I thought was going to be my fate forever. All for her. What of the husband? We kept that the secret at first, her from him, me from the church. But secrets never keep. So I left the clergy and she left her husband, but he killed her, Anton. Took a knife and just... Then he came after me. I was in the church saying my goodbyes when all of a sudden this madman burst in. He grabs me. He throws me up against the altar and he sets the church on fire. Says he was going to send us all to hell. Poor bastard didn't count on him dying first. The timbers went up like match sticks and the burning curtains, they fell on him. That seems just. Oh, there was justice to be had that night, but that wasn't it. So there I was watching everything I know burn around me, except it wasn't just me. Five other people, men who had been my friends my entire life, were going to die because of what I had done. You did not set the fire. Oh, I didn't strike the tinder, but I lit it all the same. But I knew I had to get to these men out. The whole church was falling in on itself. So I started grabbing these men and dragging them out. The last of them, my friend Gregor, I had him over my shoulder when all of a sudden, down comes crashing a support beam. I managed to toss him out, but then everything went black. When I woke up, the church, gone. My leg, crushed, broken beyond repair. And th was justice, Anton. I do not understand. God was punishing me for what I had done. He could have killed me that night, but I guess he's kinder than that, or crueler. Hard to tell sometimes. So the church kept me on as a courtesy, tending the dead. Every night since that night, I spend cleaning the paths, reading the stones and drinking away a life I remember the way someone remembers a story he was told long ago. Why did you tell me this? One day, Anton, I will have to look God in the eye and answer for what I have done. I think it will be easier if I can do something good again. ♪♪ You don't have to leave. I don't want you to.

Mr. Volker, when a child is born naturally, as God intended, it has time to grow, to learn and adapt. I think -- I think this is where a soul is formed. But my creature lacked all that. He began his existence fully formed in a body stronger than any 10 men, but with the emotional capacity no greater than an infants. Do you understand what I'm saying? I'm sorry, I don't. A baby is upset. It lashes out. But it is small, fragile, can harm no one. Now imagine that same blind emotion pure and unaffected by thought, but with the strength of a giant behind it. What the hell -- I fled from it. I saw it rise up. I saw its scarred and mangled face. Its dead, soulless eyes. And I ran. I left it to the world in hopes that it would sputter out and die. But it didn't die. It endured in the world. It offered it nothing but hate. And so it became as monstrous within as it was without. It tracked me down.
