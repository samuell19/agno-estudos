A pilgrimage. After years of neglect. A pilgrimage to recall the memory of a lifetime… … spent among the others, in secret. Only now we know, how his tragedy silently took place. With the sole company of his ghosts. In an exhausting effort to communicate with others. Closed beyond that doorstep. The fervent fantasies… … of the man that we have only recently come to know and love. A river of words. Of images. They were born here. His characters were born here. Ironic. Painful, grotesque. The realistic or paradoxical plots. An overwhelming wealth of human experience delivered to us. To our meditation. Through the pages of his novels. Did you take me for a customer? Where are these two? - You said two, right? - Two. I thought I didn't get it right, on the phone Two at a time, out of season. Suite 48. - Both? - Yes. Oh. Two what? Males? Females? Male and female? Yes, man and woman. I haven't seen them, I started my shift now. I just found a note. They have the same surname. Husband and wife! Definitely rich! - Which floor? - Second. Sorry, dad. I didn't hear the doctor come in. Miss, my respects! She's your daughter, I presume? You presume very well. She's sick, as well. Breathe. Stop. Father and daughter They said "a couple". I was thinking about a double flu, or a double cold. It happens, with husband and wife. Or maybe a double stomach bug caught at a party. A party!? We really didn't have time to party, Mimmina and I… Turn around, lie down. However, it's rare, in couples, to find…. … the same stomach ailments. Maybe she has an ostrich stomach… while the husband is prone to ulcers… … and vice-versa! Doctor, you still haven't told me what's wrong with me. It's nothing. The diagnosis is not difficult. There's nothing to worry about, my gosh. Only this rheumatic attack… … which manifests itself so acutely. However, therapy is more difficult. Today, science only has analgesics. Effective, very effective, but… The disease remains. "We have no medicine that attack its essence." … as an eighteenth-century doctor would say. Thank you, doctor. Now I would like for you to visit my daughter. - Certainly… - You're very nice. What's your name? - Vanetti. - Are we doing it here? Well, maybe better not. We would disturb your father. - Come then. - Of course. Do you have children? Yes, six. It must be nice to live in a large family. I'm an only child. Yes, but a large family has problems, too! Doctor! I would like to know why this girl has those fever lines. She had appendix surgery twelve days ago. - I see, I see! Here in Lugano? - No, Geneva. As soon as we arrived the other night, we both went to bed. My gosh, I see. It's a hassle getting sick in a hotel. - Who is it? - It's me, Miss. I'm coming. - There's a package… - Thank you, Eugenia. Mimmina, who are you? Eugenia. And who is she? The maid. What did she want at this hour? She brought the medicines sent by the doctor. That chatterbox! - How are you, dad? - So-so… - You weren't sleeping? - I was half-asleep… And your arm? Your shoulder? Go to bed, aren't you sick too? Shall we inaugurate the coffee maker? What time is it? It's early… It's not time for coffee… Why does the time matter? We're sick, anyway. Plus, I want to try it. Where's the socket? Not here… Maybe here… Ah, here it is! It should be ready in three minutes. - Did you put the coffee in? - Sure. Did you think I'd forgotten? You want to convince me you're a good housekeeper. Right now it just seems like you're confused. Do you know when I was born? Three days ago. When you took me away from that cursed dormitory. Cursed dormitory? I've never heard you say that before. I knew you'd leave me there, anyway. Why would I tell you? Oh! The cups, the sugar! You arrived just in time. It was about to soil the chair. Damn. Just a little for me, and for you too! All right. But you like it sweet. I noticed. Yes… One for me, or I'll get fat. Another. One… … and two. You know, I did the math. From the time I was seven to today… … we've been together five hundred hours. 21 days in all. What do you think? What's that, a reproach? A reproach? No! What do you think about the coffee! Oh. I've had better ones. I had worse too, if it makes you feel better. Of course it does. It's the first coffee you drink made by me. It's nice to have to think about a person who matters more than me. When I wake up in the morning, I think… "My dad is there, in that room." I can open that door, and I'll see him. I feel that even God is closer to me. God. Yes! You don't believe me… There's nothing strange about it. I just want to say that I feel happier. You have a strange way of mixing God and coffee And sugar… Ah, the medicines! The doctor was good. So worried about his son, yet he thought of us. Which son? I heard he has six. One is retarded. Didn't he tell you? He told me. I also gave him some advice. I'm good at these things. Here you are. These are yours and this is mine. Take it and go to sleep. In fact, take your temperature first. Not here, my gosh! You haven't been 6 years old for a while! You also say "my gosh" like Dr. Vanetti! It must be something your generation says. Putting me with that doctor is not a compliment. At least he's plump, well fed. You are so skinny… If you keep me around, I'll take care of you. Until proven otherwise, I'll have to take care of you! But you're a journalist. You're always on the go. You eat little and work too much! How would you know? You think it doesn't show? Can I touch your head? My daddy… Promise me, if you need anything, you'll call me and not the maid! Are you jealous of… What's her name? Eugenia! No, I have to take care of you. Finally we were able to chat in peace. But now I'm sleepy… Don't look, or you'll get horny… It's still too early! It's always the usual lines. If that means being sick… I'll leave the door ajar, so I can hear you. Close it, do me the favor. Don't forget the low insinuations. What? The doctor ordered you one suppository every six hours. Oh my God Mimmina, what a spirit… the low insinuations! It's funny, right? Mrs. Ritter would say it… … when someone was prescribed suppositories. "Girls, don't forget the low insinuations!" And Therese, my friend, would comment: "I know what low insinuations she would need!" Mimmina! Watch your language! Were you in a girls's boarding house or in a barracks!? Come on, Dad! You're being a moralist. Seriously, though… Are you sure you can put the suppositories by yourself? Will you leave me alone!? Mimmina! Mimmina! I heard a noise. What happened? I closed the window. I was dreaming, I know. I had some kind of nightmare. Did you go on the balcony in your condition? It was just a moment. Dad. Can I ask you a question? Go ahead. Do you mind living locked up in here with me? Well, for my character… … solitude is a natural condition. And secondly, "living" is inaccurate. We don't live here. We are just passing by. At least I hope. Because I'm starting to feel better. The suppositories are working. And thirdly? Thirdly, you're here. It's the first time I'm truly a father. I've never felt… … in such company. Actually, we should set some rules between the two of us. - What do you mean? - Meals, for example. I like to eat alone. It's a habit for me now. Each in their own room. Is that OK? No, it's not Okay. But you're the dad. I just have to obey. You can argue, if you want. Really, can I? I'll argue then, you'll see. But I like it if you give me orders, too. I swear I'm the least suited father to do that. You're suited, you're suited! But you still haven't answered me. Do you like it or not, staying here alone? Without your girlfriend. What do you know about my girlfriend? I may not have any, or have more than one. Do you like it or not? You're stubborn, dammit. The matter is irrelevant to us two. No comment. I have to disturb you. Can I go to the bathroom? You never had a problem with it. - It's coming. - It's coming…? My period, my gosh! See? I said "my gosh" too. Lock yourself in. - I always do. - No, you never do. I assure you, witnessing your bodily functions is not my thing! All right. If we have to live together from now on… … I need to learn your habits, your tastes. Tell me the things you don't like about me! So I'll fix them! Only a beast can get together with a boy… … who could be her son! She bewitched him! And now he says he wants to marry her! Never heard of stuff like this, ever! Marry? Isn't that woman married? She said she has three children. Yes, scattered around the world. One in Italy, the eldest, is almost 20 years old. A girl on duty in Lausanne. Who knows what kind of duty… And the youngest in an orphanage, like a foundling! These three poor creatures don't know who their father is. Not even the mother knows. With all the men she's met… And my nephew, who's like a son to me, wants to marry her! Imagine my sister. She's gonna go crazy! It's destiny, Eugenia. What could you possibly do? What can I do? I know what to do! I have nothing to lose. I told my sister… "I'll get rid of her"! - If they don't deport her… - Mimmina! … I'll make a mess! Excuse me a moment, Eugenia! You brought a show to your room with that one. You having fun? She'll hear you, poor thing. It's not funny. It's a disgrace for her! Did you hear it all? I can't read, she screams like crazy. I hope she's done! You don't have sympathy for others' misfortunes. Twinkle twinkle… Little star… How I wonder what you are? Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky… When the blazing sun is gone, When he nothing shines upon… - Then you show your little light… - Slow down! - …Twinkle, twinkle, all the night! - This is torture, not a massage! I set myself a very difficult task. Being her father after so many years of distance and detachment. That's the way this daughter is. A strange mixture of shamelessness and innocence. Of absurd provocation, albeit unconscious. Of great stubbornness… … and total helpfulness. A very strange thing about her, which I don't know how to interpret…. … It's her absolute lack of curiosity about her mother. She wants to know about my possible girlfriends. But she never asked anything about her mother. She forgot about her. Yet when Carla died, Maria Luisa… … Mimmina, as she always called her, was already 6 years old. Something of her image must have stayed inside her. What are you doing, dad? Talking to yourself? No, I'm dictating into the recorder. Is this how you work? What is it, an article? They are notes. Notes on what? For a novel, perhaps. I'm proud of you. I have such a good dad… You have no idea how envious my classmates were. Even Therese, who never gets excited about anything. When you arrived at the dorm, they'd be all in an uproar. A writer is a romantic thing. Imagine that… If they saw me in this chair paralyzed by rheumatism… I don't like this tendency you have. You always bring yourself down. Stop that thing! Well, it's recording your voice, too. I don't want it to record my voice. All right. What are you doing with that? Leave the cleaning to the maid. It's just to do something. When I have my period… … I'm nervous. Like your mother, cleaning the silverware. Who is this Therese you talk about so much? - Can I take your hand? - No! Yours are covered in cleaning gunk. The smell bothers me. It's a poisonous concoction. In some aspects, you're more delicate than a woman. Therese is an Italian girl. I mean, her parents were Italian. She was born in Switzerland. She's older than me, she's 24 years old. We've been together a long time. She's done studying now, she works in Geneva. Does she still live with you? I thought it was just students. Yes, most of them. Therese and I slept in the same room. She was so sad to see me go. I was sad to leave her, too. I would confide in her. She taught me a lot of things. Such as? About sex. She explained it all to me. Even about menstruation, what did I know? - May I set up here? - Yes. Leave it, don't worry. Go wash your hands, sanitize them. You're exaggerating, it's just a little polishing cream… So I have to go to my room to eat? You like to obey, you said it. Shall I set up the other room for the young lady? No, it doesn't matter, you can go. Enjoy your meal. Thank you. You must've suffered so much in your life, dad. Have you tasted the wine? Ah, so ​​the wine was your idea! To repay me for my life of suffering? What's up? The doggy. I'm hungry! Listen… If you want to eat here, you can come, just this once. All right? Look, you see how big it is? Enough! You hurt me! - Wait, there's another one here. - No! Ouch! You wanted to know about men, earlier today. You wanted to tell me. What is this, a funny topic? On the contrary. When I'm with a guy I like, I get very serious. But I want to rub against him so much… Did many guys made you want to do that? Three or four. Yes, even Albert, a little German. But then when they leave, I forget about it. Therese, on the other hand, if she has a crush, she's ruined. Is that why you say you're smarter? Yes, for sure. So you would control yourself better. Men are not a problem for me. They are for her. I'm sure I'll never fall in love. Heh! "Never"… Keep rubbing rubbing against men… … you'll get stuck to one, you'll see. Don't get your hopes up. Leave my stuff alone. I've tidied up my room, I'm tidying up here, too. Stendhal, Lucretius… Montaigne… these are all very old books. It wouldn't hurt you to read some of them. What a beautiful gun. Why do you have it? It has followed me since the war. You're the one who takes it with you! Let me see the typewriter. It's pretty. Why don't you dictate to me? I type 200 characters a minute, it's not bad. I can help you when you work. Why don't you get one of those books? There's modern ones, too. …and go and read in your room. Let me rest, come on. Five more minutes. I want to know you, dad. I want to know everything. Is that why you're inspecting me? We have time. - Put on the thermometer. - Already done, I have the usual lines. You have to answer one question, though. Were you happier before? Or are you happier now? With me? You're so categorical! You always want to divide the world in half. Yes or no. White or black… … but human feelings don't have clear boundaries. My feelings do. For example, I hate Frau Ritter. But I don't hate you. I'm in love with you. "I love you" is what you say to a father. I have to pee. Close the door. Sir, yes, sir! Then go straight to bed, okay? You treat me like a child. "Go pee and then go straight to bed!" You're worse than Mrs Ritter! Can I stay with you, dad? - What are you doing? - I won't bother you. Thanks, Dad. Were you very sad, sometimes? … when you were in the boarding house? Not too often. Poor little girl. Loneliness made you sad. I can be sad even with people… … if there's no one that interests me. Sure, but that's something else. When you were little… … were you afraid to sleep alone? I don't remember. I would fall asleep suddenly… Mimmina, will you give me back my arm? Your mother suffered from insomnia. You really don't. It's better that way. You don't look much like her… …but you remind me terribly of her. Who could it be? Perhaps Dr. Vanetti. At this time? He came last night! My shirt got caught! Who is it? Mail, sir. One moment. Come in. - Good morning. - Good morning. Just put it there. Someone remembers we exist. Does it still hurt? Yes, quite a bit… I'm sorry. Let's see who we have to be grateful to. There's one for you too. We'll read it later. Come to bed. What do you think about my jellyfish? They give me grief. What are you on about? Your jellyfish? What are they? My breast. Your daughter's breasts. They should concern you. The bellboy took a peek at them. He didn't seem very convinced either. It would be better if you didn't expose yourself to bellboys. There wasn't much to see anyway… It's my problem. I took some pills, too, but nothing happens. Maybe it will change with sexual activity. What are you talking about? You don't think so? Therese told me her breast used to be like mine. Then they developed with sexual activity. It's her… I'll read it later, I don't feel like it now. Will you come or not? Do you know what time it is? If anything, you have your own bed. Last night, you jumped me, took me by surprise. But it was the first and last time. You will no longer take advantage of my weakness. Never again. What do you want, Therese? Another one of your sermons? So annoying! No, no… you heard wrong! I love you I love you! Jerks! So her name is Hilde. I only read the signature, I swear! Mimmina, you need a couple of slaps! What did I do wrong? I just wanted… You never tell me anything about yourself… So I'm wrong and you're right?! Say it, are you right? What did I do wrong? I just wanted to wash your back, and you didn't want to… …I was here, and took a look. I'm your daughter, not just anybody! I have a right to know you! What right? What are you talking about? Forgive me, dad… I love you. I love you! Hit me if you want. You're right! - Beat me! - Mimmina, that's enough. Leave me here, leave me here! Mimmina only asks for… … staying close to her dad! Cut it out. Quit your show, stop it. Yes, dad. Mimmina does what you want. Guess who is visiting us? Therese, my friend. You'll see, you'll like her. Ja, ich bin krank. Ich bin krank! Im bett ins Hotel… Mit meine Tochter! Meine Tochter, Mimmina! Herr Hilde, ich kann nicht wegfahren von Lugano auch meine Tochter Mimmina ist krank! Hilde, warum verstehst du nicht? "Why don't you need someone to love you?" She said to me this morning. She always surprises m--- When the general arrived at the barracks… You ever take a bath? Didn't Mrs. Ritter teach you that? Ugh, dad! I can't, my kitty is sick. Didn't you hear he's coming up? Cover up! He has to visit me anyway. I'm ready. You're letting him find you half naked? I'm coming, doctor. Come in, come in. I was waiting for you. - I was sure you'd come. - Good morning. - Good morning. Sorry if I didn't warn. I happened to be passing by and I said… "I need to see my two patients again." Thank you. May I? Any later would've been impossible for me. The hospital, home visits, clinic… Now, of all times… …terrible day. How is it going? Well, thanks. I'm happy. Let's see, now. Let's start with you then, miss. Will you stop it, Maria Luisa? The doctor is here for us, don't waste his time! Your case is really interesting, it supports a certain theory that's making the rounds nowadays. I was reading about it in a medical journal, recently. The biological complementarity of parents with their children. As attested, of course, by blood types… But other than that… … you are lucky in your bad luck! Indeed, my gosh! You help each other! Well done. Really good. But… … all of this could also lead to a state of psychosomatic inertia. By which organisms come to a sort of… …addiction, which deprives them of any stimulus to overcome the illness. Back to us… Harder. There you go. What's your son's name? The sick one, poor thing. Gino. This morning, he seemed… … happier. He even smiled at me. He has moments where he's so sweet… Sometimes I suspect he understands everything. - Call me if you need, miss. - Yes, Eugenia. You're here, Sir? I'm done, if you'd like to go back in. Thank you. It's pretty nice here too. How's your nephew? Still fussing over that old woman? You think it's funny. If only you knew how bad I feel… I'm joking. I would never… What is my daughter doing? She got up as soon as I closed the windows. She's in there, tidying up. What a good girl! If only I had a daughter like her! Thank you, thank you. This is Mimmina snoring. Let's hope her future bed mate is a heavier sleeper than I am. I wonder why I took this tape to record… … the sound of her sleeping. Maybe it's just the pleasure of keeping something of ourselves and of others. … which is also the reason for photography No, not just for that. If anything, in this case, I'd like to amusingly highlight… … the little scenes that take place in this room, or even on this bed. On this very bed, I witnessed a more traumatic event. I woke up at dawn. Next to me I felt like a disquiet. An… agitation. My daughter's eyes were closed. But after a moment, what was happening…. … the most normal thing in this world, at that age… … became obvious to me. Inside of me, something happened that I can't define. Sex has never obsessed me. But as I stood there, frozen next to my daughter… … while she performed instinctive gestures on herself… - … I had a feeling… - It's not true! I was sleeping, I didn't notice! It was a dream, you're a liar! You hate me! You hate me! Don't do that, it's absurd. Taking notes is something I do. It wasn't to reprimand you. You don't love me! You know I love you. Come on, don't act like a child! Calm down. You study me like a bug. I'm just trying to get to know you. I only give you trouble. Get out. Go back to Bonn, go to your Hilde. Go wherever you want, I'll do without you. Mimmina. I can't resist anymore! Dad! Dad, I love you. You don't have to hurt me, you can't treat me like this. My daddy… No, Mimmina… You saw me being born… … I want only you! - Mimmina… - Oh God… Dad! Help! Help, someone! Eugenia! Mimmina! It's me, Therese. Open up, Mimmina! It's you, thank goodness! Help me, please! Dad passed out. Lift his head. I'll go get some water. How is he? Therese, is he recovered? Yes. He's getting up. I'm getting a wet towel. I'm coming. - I'm here. - What happened? I don't know, he must have slipped. Maybe he hit his head on the mantel. Strange way to get acquainted. Welcome back. Did you see who's here? She just got here. It's Therese, Dad. How are you? Small plot twist. My father also fainted sometimes. It's a family skill… ! Are you injured? There's blood, you must've hit your head. It's my fault, forgive me dad! I'm fine, Mimmina! It'd like to destroy me… But it's no match for a guy like me! So you're Maria Luisa's great friend. You arrived at the right time. And this? It fell off my table earlier. It's a real disaster, in here today! Thank you… Yes, today was just a bad day. Now that you're here, let's hope the tide will turn. Maria Luisa, what shall we do with your friend? Let's invite her to dinner here with us. Yes, thanks dad. Great idea. What do you say, Therese? As you wish, I'm here for you. Do you have a cigarette? I forgot mine in my room. Sorry, we don't smoke. I didn't think you were so run down. I feel like I'm in a hospital. > Can I get the chef, please? Yes, we are recovering with difficulty. Getting to know each other, after such a long time part… … it was hard for both of us. I'm realizing that. > Hello, we need dinner for three in our room. You look a little ironic. Don't justify yourself, you are right. Have they assigned you a room yet? Yes, right above you. > What's on the menu tonight? - I pro… > Make me look good! I propose you swap rooms with me. I can go upstairs, so you two stay close. Don't even say that as a joke! - Why? - Speak quietly… If you go upstairs, you'll give Mimmina a terrible pain. > Of course, wine too. - Guido, is the usual wine okay for you? - Yes, fine. Therese, you drink, I know. - … Or have you lost that habit too? - No! > All right then, please, thank you. While you're keeping company, I'm tidying up a bit. In honor of Therese! How do you feel? Good, good, really. I don't even know what it was… …but it happened to me again. I fainted, suddenly. Maria Luisa is very happy with your arrival. She already seems in a better mood. I hope you recover soon. - I'd like to go for a walk with you. - Certainly! Hopefully, this crazy reclusion is almost over. I can't take it anymore. I don't think Mimmina was too unhappy about this reclusion. She has done nothing but think about her dad all these years. It made me curious to meet him, this famous dad! > Guido. > Can you come here for a moment? What do you want? Just a moment, can you come? Excuse me. What are you doing? Can you tell me what day mom died? What got into your head? What does it mean? Why are you standing here? Your friend is here, why do you always have to be fancy? I want to know it. You have to tell me, please. I don't remember anymore. How old was mom when she died? She was 30. Twice my age now. Isn't that a little too loud? It's late, there's other people. I'm sorry. I'll turn it off if it bothers you No, I like it. You like it. Because… it reminds you of mom? Mom? I don't understand the link. It's sweet music. And didn't mom play the piano? She was no Rubinstein, but she was pretty good. Explain to me, Mimmina… … why this sudden memory of mom? We talked so little about her… I thought I'd give you grief, because… … I think you haven't forgotten about her. Mommy was Spanish, wasn't she? Yes, but she's always lived in Argentina. But you… … what do you remember about her? - You were so little… - Sometimes I dream about her. But I can never see her face. I think I have a memory. In a large garden, full of flowers. We had a beautiful garden in Buenos Aires. Grandpa began to hit the dog with the leash… He had a newspaper in his hand. It's like I can I see him… He was a tall man. Mom comes running… … And she takes the dog in her arms to protect it. Then grandpa scolds her too. And mom starts crying. It's very likely to have happened, my child. Do you remember anything else about her? No, I don't think so. But I think about her often. Really? Yes. The way she died… Do I have to tell you? What? I think she wanted it. She did it on purpose, driving her car against that wall. What are you talking about? You do your mother a grave disservice by thinking that… … it's absurd! I didn't think it up now. I've been convinced of that for a long time. Ah, you're sure of it! Sure, who's gonna take it off your head? We've never talked about this before. You don't even know how it happened… You must know that Carla and I weren't just husband and wife. We were also lovers. You're old enough to understand… We were in love. But you… …you'd been away for a long time. You thought about this too… If you really want to know… … I was about to come back, around that time. And you didn't find her… Maybe she wanted to punish you. Punish me? What are you on about? Punish you for your absence. Didn't you… … ever think that she might have killed herself? You could have asked me anything about your mother. I've always hoped to be able to talk to you about it someday. How beautiful she was… … full of life… Did you want to know what I thought in those days? I thought of everything. I was desperate. Yes, even that she committed suicide. It took me months to retrace the last days of her life. Her last hours. Believe me… I haven't found anything that'd lead me to your conclusion. So, do you like it? You're beautiful. Not me, the dress! It was Anne-Marie's. She got pregnant and it didn't fit her anymore. She sold it to me for nothing. It was a deal. Nice to see you again, sir. Thank you. Is your wife still ill? No, She's my daughter. Of course, I'm sorry. You'll see, she'll recover soon. - Enjoy your walk, Sir. - Thank you. Why don't you get up? You should get outdoors! Have some fun, find yourself a nice boyfriend… I can't. You go. All right. I'll go before it starts raining again. Come on, come with me! Come! I'm waiting for you! No, he'll yell at me. I have to obey. I'll be back soon. If you meet him, say hi for me. Today is the first time he goes out. All right, bye. HI. Mimmina says hi. She expected us to meet. - What was her mood like? - Good, it seemed. Mimmina has a good character. I don't think I've ever seen her in a bad mood. It's true. She has quite a cheerful disposition. Almost feisty. This coexistence experiment is proving to be very difficult for me. I pictured it when she wrote that you were together… …in two adjoining adjoining rooms. You've also shared a room with Mimmina. Yes, for one year. But it's not the same thing. What do you mean? You're a man. Her father. In any case, believe me, I got on well with Mimmina. I would never have shared a room with her otherwise. Back then, I was working at the boarding house as an assistant. Mimmina studied outside. Our hours together were very enjoyable. We would laugh so much! Mimmina feels your maturity very much. It's normal, I'm eight years older. She adores you. I can picture her… Now you're here for her. - Will you excuse me a moment? - Sure… The phone, please. Back there, sir. She showered me with recommendations, like a caring wife. It was very thoughtful of you to call. Let's go for a walk? Yes, I was thinking about that too. - How much it is? - One fifty. Thank you. > How nice! There's snow! Hear that? They say there's snow. I'm dressed so lightly… We will freeze to death. If you want to go for a walk… …I'll for you somewhere warm. I'm freezing. - I need to warm up. - No, no… Let's go to the bar, please! With my rheumatism… Come. … anyway, too bad for him! Why didn't you bring him on holiday with you? What a holiday that would have been! Mario is just a reserve. He sits there, waiting his turn… … If it ever comes. If you don't love him, why not leave him? Get rid of him? What's the rush? You never know, in life. Did you ever read those ads in the paper… "Wanted: good-looking secretary" ? I've seen so many… Do you think I'm good looking? Too much so, for a secretary! Yeah, I always rejected those job offers. They just want the good looks, not the secretary! Is it better this way? "I'm a serious, responsible girl, Sir… I need to work, I'm starving! If there's overtime to do, I won't back down!" Will you hire me? Your hands are freezing. I do Public Relations in a bank. A very… Swiss job. It took me so long to find it… It's not exactly ideal. What if I get tired? There's always Mario, waiting for his turn. If you put it like that, I look petty. Maybe I am. I've been looking for love. I still am. But I've never found it. Maybe you can live without love. Don't you think? Don't you like it? The view? I can't see it, it's too cold! Although, next to you… I think I'm warmer than inside that place. Even the Punch was barely warm! Aren't all these sudden changes in temperature bad you? Nice! Do you like it? Let's try it on you. You are fine, fine priest! You know, a priest fell in love with me, once. A handsome, young man! I'm sorry. You'll tell Mimmina you went to the movies. I'll be back after dinner from a trip to Locarno. It's better that way. Mimmina, are you there? Mimmina! You're crazy! Come here! Get in! Come on! Get in. I did it because I wanted to get sicker! Sicker? Aren't you sick enough? Don't you give your father enough worries already?! I wasn't out for long! I went when I heard you coming! I'm sorry! Mimmina, I'm tired. Very tired. If you don't stop harassing me, I'll send you away! I quit as a father! See you every twelve months, at Christmas! Am I clear?! Huh?! Why don't you understand me? Why don't you believe me? I can't take her to the seaside now. I got a letter from my boss… …with orders to return to Bonn within four days. I see, but we can find a solution. Think of the Ligurian Riviera this season. A real charm! I often go there by car with my children on weekends. I know her every inch! Oh yes, I forgot… You daughter is quite a dear girl. She invited me to dinner at your suite tonight. Oh, good. Didn't you know? No, but I'm happy. We'll be waiting for you. Anyway, another climate would be a remarkable adjuvant! - After you. - Thanks. Even from a psychological point of view. Because from a medical point of view… … she's healthier than you and me! She's so young… Bless her. Monogamous, doctor? What do you mean? Monogamous, yes! I found out I was one when she… … my wife, left me forever, poor thing. And since then, you've always respected her memory? Diligently, yes. My God, how long has it been? - Seven years. - Seven?! Yes, I know… You're so young, exuberant. You're amazed, but… After spending your whole life with the same person… … sharing joys, pains, everything… When she's gone, you feel that… … that she's irreplaceable. Where could you ever find such communion again? That total complementarity… moral… and also physical… … which was built up over many years. Other women may attract me for a moment. Superficially, but it's just a glimpse, an illusion. Then, when I get close… nothing. I feel nothing anymore. And the illusion is followed by a deep disappointment. And then I… - I give up. - Give up? It's so touching, doctor! You know what? I've read that there's also a monogamous pigeon breed. Maria Luisa! The doctor is a Homo Sapiens! …which is by no means monogamous. The doctor is not a pigeon! - A wood pigeon, if anything! - Don't be joking, doctor. I understand you perfectly. In fact, here's to your monogamy. Now, I'm confused. Don't you tell me you're monogamous, too! As long as I get to drink, I'm ready to make any toast. - I'll do it with water! - To monogamy! Oh, it's so late! I still have a visit to make! I must run. I have to rush! I'm really sorry. One more for the road, doctor! Oh, sure! Cheers. Cheers to you, doctor. Goodbye! I have to go, sorry. No! That's my room, not the exit. Dad, show him. It's not necessary… I'm very lucid… It was just a glass of wine… It's nothing, my gosh! Goodbye flowers… - The Italian neodrama, beautiful! - Goodbye! I'm really tired. You should go to bed, too. My purse… - Tell your dad I said bye. - All right, bye. Good night. I think the doctor is very nice. Yes, but one of these days his veins are gonna burst, that big man with his monogamy! Do you want them? No, I quit. Didn't you notice? Yes, I saw you haven't smoked. I thought it was for your father. Good night. Bye. These are yours. Thank you. You dropped them last night. Sorry about last night. Did you sleep after? Not at all. You're a little crazy, aren't you Because I seek your friendship? You already have my friendship. That's not true. It's not easy for someone like me to get the attention… … not just the curiosity, of someone like you. - Why ? - It's the sign of true friendship. - The game is a return to childhood. - Precisely! So we circle around the trees. I've never been on a plane. Dear Dad, today has been long and sad. I've was alone all day. Then the doctor came. But I always thought about you… …and you weren't coming back. So I wrote you this letter. I often want to write to you. Come back soon, my creature. What are you doing there? Have you read it? Are you angry? Why did you write me a letter like this? Your letters from boarding school were normal. I don't like that you write like this. Because I can't feel the Mimmina I knew. A nice daughter, always cheerful, playful. The expressions you use for me are caring, but they're not right. They're not appropriate for a father. So I don't like them. I don't like them at all. Next time, I'll change the signature. I'll sign it Therese, or maybe Hilde. So you'll like them. There, this is your mistake. You can't replace other women. Do you understand this? Yes or no? You love the other girls. It doesn't make sense, what you're saying. I love you like a daughter. Very, very much. Do you think I've never been with a woman? I have. With many. Whom I also loved. What do you have to do with it? Do you mind if I smoke? Does it bother you? No, no. Go ahead. No bother. I'd like to talk to you. As old friends, like the old times. Has Mario left you? You were so close… How come? Who told you he left me? I'm the one holding his reins loose. It's better not to be too possessive with men. But you used to say… "Being with Mario is a beautiful thing." Yes. I remember it very well. You swore you'd never leave him… … and whined because your period was late. Don't exaggerate! Me, whining? It was just a false alarm. You were more scared than me. You've been with him more than a year, right? Two, to be exact. The first few months nobody knew why I went to Zurich so often. I had figured it. You can hide nothing from me, Therese. I know you too well. Now, I ask you only one thing. Don't take him away from me. You're not talking about Mario. You know exactly who I'm talking about. What are you on about? Who would separate a father from a daughter? Are you being honest, Therese? I've only now learned to love. I didn't know what it meant, before. I was happy when he came to visit me in Geneva… …and we spent a few hours together. … or the few days he took me with him on holiday. But now it's different. No one should come between us. You have to leave us be. I don't understand you. Of course I'll leave you be. And what does it mean that nobody has to… … come between you two? > You're his daughter, that's it. > Do you expect me to babysit you? > You're a little too big for that. > How could he think only of you? He's a man. > That doesn't concern you. > Why not? > We are friends. > You should think only of getting better and get back to your studies. > Maybe going back to Geneva? My father works in Bonn, you know. Would you like to move in with him? Would you like to go to Bonn? There's already one Hilde, in case you didn't know. You really talk like you have a high fever. Mimmina, what are you on about? Me, in Bonn? You're crazy! I only have a few lines. I'm more lucid than ever, my dear! I can't talk to Mimmina today. I'm going for a walk… … or maybe back to where I came from. What are you doing? Are you stuck there? Do you plan to win my affection with these scenes? Answer me! Why do you treat me like this? Can't you see how much I'm suffering? You're happy to see me suffer. And do you thing God is pleased? I've been wanting to ask you for so many days. I only love you… … but I don't have to show it! … I have to pretend! … even if I'm your daughter! You're my father and you can't… In the name of God, Mimmina! Yes, precisely in the name of that God you call into question so often. How can I think only of you? And why? You're the one refusing a life outside of mine! Look how you treated your friend! Stop, stop saying it! She wants to take you away from me. I trusted her. She was my friend, I loved her. But now I hate her. I hate her! Sure, what can I do? I will leave All right, fine. > Bring down Mrs. Schweizer's bags from the fourth floor. > Then call Giovanni. I spoke to the newspaper. I really have to go back to Bonn. Did you say goodbye to Mimmina? I just tried, over the phone. She hung up on me. I've never seen her like this I'm worried, too. I don't know what to do for her. Honestly, I don't have a clue either. Luckily, Vanetti is proving to be a true friend. He's with her now. I have to go. Can you wait for me five minutes? I don't want to stay in here anymore. The ultra violet rays… The iodine-salt air… But most of all… … freedom… … of thoughts… … of the movements… Running… … by the sea. Will you listen for a moment, Mimmina? Has the doctor spoken to you? Yes, yes, I… Sending you to the seaside was his suggestion. He will accompany you. Right, doctor? Yes, Camogli. I found a pension there. You'll see! One of the nicest and most picturesque places on the Riviera. I'll also leave three of my kids there. I will come to see you… …every other Sunday, Miss Maria Luisa. Meanwhile, for a few days, until we leave… … I will keep you company, if you want. Did you hear, Mimmina? Maria Luisa! Yes, dad. It's not urgent, I'm only leaving tomorrow. I have to go to Bonn. You saw the letter they sent me, didn't you? I phoned them now, they insist. I might even get in trouble if I don't come back. What about me? Read it, you'll realize I'm not making anything up. I'm an employee! You must understand, this is the reality of my existence. And yours, too. I was called to order. No more, no less. Are you going out now? Yes, I am. It's not like you're giving me much satisfaction anyway. I speak and you don't listen! Go, go. Do not worry. So I can explain to the young lady my treatment plan, because… … I want to see her… … flourish again. I could've taken a taxi If you preferred to stay with her. I am running away, too. Didn't you notice? You don't know what Mimmina is capable of. Our encounters are the most painful sight in this world. You haven't given me your address in Bonn yet. I don't have the courage to lie too much to Mimmina. And to the woman you have in Bonn? Why are you turning here? Where are you going? I didn't ask to drive just to be a chauffeur. You mean I'm in your hands? What fascinates me about you is your sweet hypocrisy. It's not much. I understand I can't ask much of a weak egoist like you. Not even friendship. Too much effort. You thought I wanted to take you from your Hilde. From your daughter, your job, upending your world, your habits… Maybe I was a little aggressive. …and you were scared. Come on, give me your address, or I'll gouge your eyes out. This is mine. Don't throw it away, at least for a while. I really regret… … that even Mimmina's jealousy has come… … between me and her dad. Every hour that passes, you are dearer to me. Thank you. At least you told me once. Look. I hadn't even put on my panties. I had something planned. Our last goodbye on this car. We are here in this car. No… So you'll start believing in my friendship. I'm sorry, I'm also complicating things for you. You're in so much trouble already… We go to the station now. You won't even come in. You'll take back your wheel… …turn your car around… … come back to your Mimmina, and that's it! No, please. … Yes, but I didn't hear anything, the maid called me. Ah, here's her father. Sir. Please, don't go upstairs. Why? Your daughter got hurt. Listen. Sir. It's useless. Don't be alarmed, it's not that serious. Sir. Where are you going? Oh, it's you! She's not here. It was an accident… Don't think about anything else! It was certainly an accident! Poor thing. She was packing her bags. Oh God, God! What a disaster! Oh God, God… Where is she? Where did they take her? At Villa Neumann, the clinic. She was alive, then. Yes, of course. Come. We'll take you. Mimmina, why? - Why, Mimmina? - By mistake! She picked up the revolver by mistake! I was at room 315, I heard the shot. I got scared but I didn't think… Then I heard yelling. When I came in, she was on the bed. There was so much blood. She called… she called… She called? Who was she calling? I didn't understand. I don't know… - Where is she? I want to see her. - You can't, they're preparing her. - Preparing? - Yes, for the surgery We're waiting for the head physician. Yes, I had been with her up to an hour earlier. She was… … very normal. We talked about my son. You know, about Gino. She was very interested in his illness. Tell me about this surgery. Can we hope…? Stay calm. In my opinion, there is no danger. No vital organs appear to be injured. Here he is, the head physician. Professor Lutz. I want to talk to him. I have the right to know what's happening! I already told you. We can only wait. That tragic gunshot. The echo of his most secret obsessions still reverberates within these walls. How can the idea of ​​ending one's life arise? For the impossibility of being understood… … to be loved. In the novel "Un dramma borghese" by Guido Morselli… … from the last lines, one can deduce that Mimmina has some chance of being saved. Guido, however, was not saved. The writer Guido Morselli… … who committed suicide in Varese on August 1, 1973. in the desperate solitude in which he had conceived his works.
