Sounds like a setup for a joke. But somehow, I don't think I'm gonna like the punchline. - Steven, the board has had a meeting and, they're concerned about you and Krystal. - Oh, so the board is listening to tabloid rumors, now? - So, are the rumors not true? - Krystal's just tired and confused right now. I'm gonna talk to her. She'll see things my way. - The church is willing to pay for a sabbatical for you, Steven and counseling for you both. Look. Here's a place I think can help. - I don't need a sabbatical. We don't need counseling. - Well, the board thinks you do. - Really? And if disagree? What? You intend to fire me? Gentlemen, are we forgetting this place was spiritually dead before I got here. I have worked night and day to raise the quality of this music ministry. Your congregation actually wants to worship now. You do realize they're packing into the pews to hear my music, right? - Oh, wow. - Steven, the carolers are ready to rehearse. - Carol, I'm a little busy right now. I'll catch up with you later. - But you said you wanted to run through the songs-- - I said I am busy. - Whoa, whoa. - Steven, you are out of control! - Gentlemen, would you give us a moment, please? - All right, that's fair. Take the sabbatical, Steven. - Steven, asking you as a friend and a brother, take this seriously. - I don't respond well to threats. - It's not a threat. It's concern. - Really? Concern for me, or the collection plate? They're coming into the services to see me and you all know it. This place was nothing before I got here and it's gonna be nothing without me. This is my ministry. I did this. It's not the board's, it's not yours, it's mine! - Really? And all these years I thought it was God's. - Welcome, friend. Glad you came in from the storm. What can I do for you? - Oh, just coffee, thanks. Is this place new? I don't remember seein' this place before. - New? No, been here longer than dirt. - Well, what are you doin' open? I mean, tonight, of all nights. Figured this would be one place that'd be closed on a night like tonight. - We're always here when needed. But if there's nothing else right now... - No. - Well. I'll be in the back if you need me. Merry Christmas, friends. - Thank you, and Merry Christmas to you, sir. - Merry Christmas. And you to sir, good evening, Merry Christmas. - Every fool going about with Merry Christmas on his lips be boiled in his own pudding, buried with a stake of holly through his heart. - Ah, Mr. Scrooge is it, then? Yes, Mr. Dickens surely had a way with words. - Sir. How are you not filled with joy tonight? Don't you realize what today is? - Don't you realize that Jesus probably wasn't born on December 25th? - Aw, we don't worry about such things as that. We believe any night is a good time to celebrate the birth of our Lord and Savior. - Yes, and to paraphrase your Mr. Dickens, we like to keep Christmas in our hearts all year long. - Fine, you keep Christmas in your way. I'll keep Christmas in mine. - Well, my dear grumpy friend, at least allow us the opportunity to introduce ourselves. This is my good friend, Shermond, but we like to call him Cephas. - And this is Rabbi Saul. - Really? Peter and Paul? - Ah, so you are schooled in the scriptures, then? - I've done a fair amount of study, yes. - Well, good. Well, you'll do well to keep up with my learned brother, here. He studied with Gamaliel, you know. Hebrew of Hebrews, by law a Pharisee, but, by righteousness based on that law. Lawless. - Well, and as you know, brother, I consider it all a loss to the surpassing worth of knowing Christ as my Lord, for Whose sake I have lost all things. - I know well, my friend. But sir, if you know the scripture, why are you not filled with joy tonight? For, it's the celebration of what our brother, John, wrote. For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son so whoever believes shall not perish, but have everlasting life. - I'm familiar with the story, okay? I even wrote a song about it. - Are you? - Then rejoice. Again, I say, rejoice. Think of it, sir. A God who so loved us that, at the right time, while we were yet sinners, sent His one and only Son to save us. Sir. On such a night as this, it happened, just as Isiah prophesied. For unto us, a child is born. Unto us, a Son is given, and the government shall rest upon His shoulder and He shall be called wonderful, counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. ♪ What child is this who laid to rest ♪ ♪ On Mary's lap is sleeping ♪ ♪ Whom angels greet with anthem tweet ♪ ♪ While shepherds watch are keeping ♪ ♪ Why lies He in such mean estate ♪ ♪ Where ox and ass are feeding ♪ ♪ Good Christians, fear, for sinners here ♪ ♪ The silent Word is pleading ♪ ♪ Haste, this is Christ the King ♪ ♪ Whom shepherds caught and angels sing ♪ ♪ Haste, haste to bring Him laud ♪ ♪ The babe, the Son of Mary ♪ ♪ Nails, spears shall pierce Him through ♪ ♪ The cross He bore for me, for you ♪ ♪ Hail, hail the Word made flesh ♪ ♪ The Babe, the Son of Mary ♪ ♪ So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh ♪ ♪ ♪ The King of kings salvation brings ♪ ♪ Let loving hearts enthrone Him ♪ ♪ Raise, raise a song on high ♪ ♪ The virgin sings her lullaby ♪ ♪ Joy, joy for Christ is born ♪ ♪ The Babe, the Son of Mary ♪ ♪ The Babe, the Son of Mary ♪ ♪ Behold the lamb ♪ ♪ Of God ♪ And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men. - Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan. As Jesus was coming up out of the water, Heaven tore open and the Spirit descended like a dove upon Him and a great voice cried out, You are My Son, Whom I love. With You, I am well pleased. Then one day, Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret. My brother, Andrew, and I were on our boats washing the nets and Jesus came aboard my boat. He told me to push out from the land, for the crowds were drawing in and He wished to teach them, so I did so, and when He was finished speaking, He told me to pull out into the deep and drop my net down for a catch. I told Him, Master, we had worked a day and night and we caught nothing, but, by Your word, I will let down my net. And suddenly, a great multitude of fish, our nets began to break. I called over my partner in the other boat and we had filled both boats so. They both began to sink. I was amazed, for the fish obeyed this man. Jesus approached me and, I fell to His feet, saying to part from me, Lord, for I am a simple man. And He came to me and He said come. Follow Me and I will make you a fisher of men. Immediately we left the nets and we followed Him and the multitudes were amazed at His teachings, for He taught them with authority, and not like the scribes. - We had a little saying. Love your neighbor and hate your enemy, but Jesus taught them, love your enemies and bless those who curse you. Do good to those who hate you and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you. Whoever strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. Give to those who ask of you. Do not turn away the one who desires to borrow from you. Oh. He spoke like no other. - For three years, we followed Him, we saw Him give sight to the blind, cause the lame to walk, He calmed the storm and He cast out demons. He fed 5,000 with a few loaves and some fish. He healed the lepers and we saw Him raise the dead. - As it is written, those who walked in darkness, they have seen a great light. Those who lived in the land of the shadow of death, on them the light has shined. - We were eyewitnesses to His Majesty. He had taken us up on a high mountain, and we saw Him changed. His clothing became glistening. Elijah and Moses appeared and He was speaking with them. And a great voice came from His majestic glory saying, this is My beloved Son. Listen to Him. For three years, the word became flesh and lived among us. We still didn't understand. Jesus began telling us that He had to go to Jerusalem and suffer a great many things for, the elders, chief priests and scribes, to be killed, but on the third day, be raised up. - This was during the Passover when you started for Jerusalem? - Yes. Yes, when Jesus arrived in Jerusalem, the city was stern, and they called out, "Who is this?" And the crowds answered, "This is Jesus, "Prophet of Nazareth and Galilee." And they spread branches and cloaks and they shouted "Josannah!" to the Son of David. "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." - Oh, he angered the Pharisees. - That is an understatement, dear brother. "Woe to you Pharisees, scribes" He said. "Hypocrites." - "You are like whitened tombs which outwardly "appear beautiful, but inwardly, you're full "of dead men's bones. "Outwardly, you are righteous, but inwardly you are "full of hypocrisy and iniquity!" So, the chief priest and the scribes went to the court of the high priest. They counseled together to take Jesus by deceit and kill Him. They said, "Not during the feast, lest a riot occur "among the people." - We had prepared the Passover meal and that evening we were reclining at the table, eating. Jesus spoke, "Truly, I tell you. "One of you will betray me. "One of you eating here." We were shocked and saddened. We had said, "Surely, you don't mean me?" "It is one of the 12" He said. - He referred to Judas Iscariot. - Then, Jesus took the bread, and when He had given thanks, He broke it, and He gave it to us, and He said, "Take it. "This is My body." - "It was broken for you. "Do this in memory of Me." - Then, He took the cup and after He had given thanks, He said, "This is My blood of the covenant, "which has been poured out for many." - "Do this as often as you drink in memory of Me." And then He predicted, it all will fall away. - Yes, yes. But I proclaimed, "Even if I have to die right beside You, "I would never disown You." Jesus looked at me and he said, "Tonight, "before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." After Him, we went to the Mount of Olives, and Jesus said, "Sit here while I pray, "for My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even to death." As He withdrew, Jesus prayed. "Abba Father, if You are willing, "take this cup from Me, "but not My will, but Yours be done." For Jesus knew exactly what was going to happen. He prayed earnestly and His sweat became like drops of blood. ♪ In a garden dark and deep ♪ ♪ In a quiet garden ♪ ♪ In a garden while we sleep ♪ ♪ In a quiet garden ♪ ♪ An innocent man, a savior of man ♪ ♪ In a quiet garden ♪ ♪ Will take a cup that's meant for me ♪ ♪ Alone in a quiet garden ♪ ♪ In a garden dark and deep ♪ ♪ In a quiet garden ♪ ♪ A man of sorrow and agony ♪ ♪ In a quiet garden ♪ ♪ He cries out in love to His Father above ♪ ♪ In a quiet garden ♪ ♪ He'll take the cup that's meant for me ♪ ♪ To a hill called Calvary ♪ ♪ Great Father let Thy will be done ♪ ♪ In a quiet garden ♪ ♪ In a quiet garden ♪ ♪ Alone in a quiet garden ♪ As He rose from prayer, Jesus found us asleep. We couldn't even stay awake for an hour while He prayed. Jesus called out to us, "The hour has come. "Behold the Son of Man is betrayed "into the hands of sinners." And before Jesus finished speaking, Judas came with the multitudes, with swords and with clubs. The elders, the chief priests, and the scribes. Judas had told them, "Whoever I kiss, is the one. "Seize Him." Immediately Judas came to Jesus and he had said, "Hail Rabbi!", and kissed him. Jesus replied, "Friend, why are you here?" Even then, Jesus still called him friend. They had laid hands on Him and taken Him. We had fled in fear and they took Him to Caiaphas, to a place where the scribes and the elders were gathered. John followed, as did I, at a distance. - The trial was cowardly and a mockery, illegal, at night while Jerusalem slept. The whole council gathered together to bring false testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, and yet they found none. Many brought false testimonies against Him, and yet, they could not agree. The chief priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Are You the Christ? "Are You the Son of the Blessed?" And Jesus said, "I am, "for you shall see the Son of Man "sitting at the right hand of power "coming with the clouds of the sky." Considered blasphemy! The chief priest tore his clothes and said, "What further need do we have of witnesses?" And they all condemned Jesus to be worthy of death. - I was there, in the courtyard. A maid of the high priest saw me and she said, "You, you with the Nazarene, Jesus." I was afraid and I answered, "I don't know "what you're saying." And she called to others and said, "This is him. "This is one of them." And I said, "I tell you, I don't know the man." And another called out and said, "You are one of them, "for you are Galilean." And I swore and I said, "I don't know the man!" And just then, I heard a rooster crow. And I remembered of what Jesus had said to me: "Tonight, before the rooster crows, "you will deny me three times." I was so ashamed. I wept and I went away. - The assembly arose, led Jesus to Pilate, the Roman governor, accusing Him, saying, "This man is perverting the nations, "forbidding paying taxes to Caeser, "and saying that He, Himself is the Christ, "a king." - Pilate told the Jewish leaders, "Take this man, "and judge Him according to your laws." And they responded, "It is unlawful for us "to sentence a man to death." Pilate came to Jesus and asked, "Are You the King of the Jews?" And Jesus replied, "My kingdom is not of this world." And Pilate said, "You are a king, then?" Jesus said, "You say that I am a king. "For this reason I have come into the world, "that I should testify to the truth, "for everyone who is of truth will listen to my voice." And Pilate said, "What is truth?" and went out. - How many, many ask that same question today, denying the truth, preferring to follow their own truth and doing what is right in their own lives, and like Pilate, they don't want to hear that Jesus is the truth! - Pilate told the Jews he had found no fault with Jesus. He had tried to send Him to Herod, on trial, but Herod returned Him. Pilate came to the mob and said, "You have a custom. "On the Passover, I shall release someone. "Do you want me to release this King of the Jews?" And the mob answered, "Not him, but Barabbas." - Barabbas. Barabbas was a murderer. - Pilate had asked the mob, "What then? "What then would you have me do "with that whom you call the King of the Jews?" And the crowd cried out, "Crucify him!" - So, Pilate, to please the mob, released Barabbas and handed over Jesus to be flogged and crucified. As it is written, for He shall be pierced for our transgressions. He shall be crushed for our iniquities, and the punishment will bring our peace will be on Him. And by His wounds, we are healed. - We all hid in fear, except John, and the women. - We went to that place that is called the Skull. They crucified Jesus right there, between two criminals and Jesus said, "Father. "Forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." - Then about the sixth hour, the whole land was covered in darkness until the ninth hour. - Sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was torn in two. - Jesus said, "It is finished." And He bowed his head, and He gave up His spirit. - Joseph of Arimathea went to Pilate, asked for Jesus' body. He took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth, and laid Him there, in a new tomb. - After the Sabbath, the first day of the week, the women went to the tomb to anoint Jesus' body. When they got there, they saw the stone was rolled away, and His body was gone. They ran to us to tell us the news. John and I, we ran to the tomb and found that His body was gone and His linen clothes were empty. ♪ Were you there when they crucified my Lord ♪ ♪ Were you there when they crucified my Lord ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Sometimes it causes me to tremble ♪ ♪ Tremble, tremble ♪ ♪ Were you there when they crucified my Lord ♪ ♪ Were you there when they nailed Him to the tree ♪ ♪ Were you there when they nailed Him to the tree ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Sometimes it causes me to tremble ♪ ♪ Tremble, tremble ♪ ♪ Were you there when they nailed Him to the tree ♪ ♪ Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb ♪ ♪ Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Sometimes it causes me to tremble ♪ ♪ Tremble, tremble ♪ ♪ Were you there when they lay Him in the tomb ♪ ♪ Were you there when He rose up from the grave ♪ ♪ Were you there when He rose up from the grave ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Sometimes I feel like shouting glory ♪ ♪ Glory, glory ♪ ♪ Were you there when He rose up from the grave ♪ ♪ Were you there when He rose up from the grave ♪ - In the evening, we assembled behind locked doors, because we feared for our lives, then Jesus appeared in the middle of us and said, "Peace be to you." We were terrified, thinking we were seeing a spirit, and He asked, "Why do you have doubts in your hearts? "See my hands and my feet "and it is truly Me. "Touch Me and see, for a spirit doesn't have "flesh and bones as you see I have." - Jesus showed Himself alive, after He suffered by many proofs. He appeared to them over a period of 40 days. First to Cephas, then to the 12, then he appeared to over 500 brothers all at once, then to James and all the Apostles. He opened their minds that they might understand the scriptures. He said to them, "Thus is written, and thus "it was necessary for the Christ to suffer "and be raised on the third day "and for repentance and remission of sins "to be preached in His name to all nations." - He led us out to Bethany and He raised His hands and He blessed us and He was carried up into the heavens and we worshiped Him. - I know all this. I know. I've worked for the Lord. I have! But is it appreciated? Seems like the more I try, more things go wrong. I used to be so confident in the Lord. Now, it's like, He doesn't even hear me, like He's given up on me. I've tried so hard. And now it's, slipping away. - Ah, yes. I used to have that same confidence in the flesh, for I was of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, circumcised on the eighth day, a Pharisee, but if you rejoice in Christ, there is no confidence in the flesh. There is no one righteous, no not one! No one understands! No one seeks after God! For all I've sinned, and all I've fallen short of the glory of God. - Yes. But I've made too many mistakes. I've hurt people, even my own wife. - Oh, my friend. His grace is sufficient for you, for His power is made perfect in our weakness. We are justified freely by grace, through faith in the atoning sacrifice of His blood. There is, therefore, now no condemnation to those who are in Christ. I am the least of the Apostles, not even worthy to be called an Apostle because I persecuted the church. But by the grace of God, I am what I am, and how greatly glory and my weakness so that the power of Christ may rest on me! I held the garments of those whose stoned Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit. I ravaged the whole assembly of the church! every house, dragging men and women off to prison. I went to the high priest, asked for letters to be written from him to the synagogues of Damascus that I may find any who are of the way. Bring them, bound, to Jerusalem. As I neared Damascus, suddenly a light shone around me. I fell to the ground as I heard a voice say, "Why are you persecuting Me?" And I asked, "Who are You, Lord?" The Lord said, "I am Jesus, Whom you are persecuting." ♪ Amazing grace ♪ ♪ How sweet ♪ ♪ The sound ♪ ♪ That saved ♪ ♪ A wretch ♪ ♪ Like me ♪ ♪ I once ♪ ♪ Was lost ♪ ♪ But now ♪ ♪ I'm found ♪ ♪ Was blind ♪ ♪ But now ♪ ♪ I see ♪ - Barnabas brought Paul to us, and he declared that the Lord spoke to him on the road to Damascus, and from that time, Paul preached in the name of Jesus and suffered many things. - Three times beaten with rods. Once, stoned. Three times shipwrecked, for I think that God has displayed us, the Apostles lasted we were like men sentenced to death. Hunger and thirst. Cold and nakedness. We are like the filth of the world. They call us fools, even until now. - I haven't suffered as you have. I've been... Selfish. I've been prideful. How could I possibly be worthy of Him? - My friend. Do you not know who you are? You are a beloved child of God. Not for what you do but for who you already are in Christ. All of us in the flesh are unclean things. Our great works are but filthy rags compared to a holy and perfect God. But if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away, old things have become new. For Him who knew no sin God made Him to be sin on our behalf so that we in Him might become the righteousness of God. Now, if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit, the spirit is alive because of righteousness, for you have not received the spirit of bondage to feel but you have received the spirit of adoption buy Whom we cry, Abba, Father. - Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord, Jesus Christ, who in His great mercy, became our Father again through the resurrection of Jesus from the dead to an incorruptible, undefiled inheritance that does not fade away reserved in Heaven for you. - My brother. Oh, my brother, you are already a saint. You are not a stranger or a foreigner. You are a fellow citizen with the saints in the household of God. To the man who works, the reward is not counted as grace, but as something owed to him, but to the one who does not work but believes in God to justify him by grace, that man's faith is credited to him as righteousness. The love and the kindness of God toward mankind is this, not that we are saved by works of righteousness that we, ourselves, did, but by His mercy, through Christ's sacrifice so that by grace, we are justified and made heirs of eternal life. Understand this: You are now an heir because you are a beloved child of the Father. - So, is nothing I do worth anything, then? - To those who believe in God, they should be careful to maintain good works, for these things are good and profitable to all men, but shun foolish questionings and disputes about fulfilling the law. These are unprofitable and vain. Each will receive his reward according to his own labor, for we are privileged to be God's fellow workers, but salvation, oh, salvation is by grace through faith and not of works, otherwise, grace is no longer grace. Or, would you prefer to make your works your God? - Have good behavior so that others may see your good works and glorify God, but you were redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, in whom, though you do not see him, you believe, receiving the result of your faith, the salvation of your soul. - For by grace, you have been saved, through faith, a gift of God, not of works, so that no one can boast. I never wish to boast except in the cross of Jesus Christ, my Lord, through Whom which the world is crucified to me and I to the world. The spirit testifies with our spirit that we are children of God and joint heirs with Christ. He Who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how would He not also grant us all things? Who can bring a charge against God's chosen ones when Christ is the one seated at the right hand of God making intercession for us? Who can separate us from the love of Christ? I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing shall separate us from the love of God which is in Christ, Jesus our Lord. For Christ is the fulfillment of the law to righteousness, to everyone who believes, for if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, repent of your sins and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. Now then, you were raised together with Christ. Seek the things that are above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the Earth, for the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, goodness, kindness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. But on therefore as God's chosen, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness and lowliness, humility and perseverance, bearing with and forgiving others even as Christ forgave you. Brother, walk in love and let the peace of God rule in your heart and be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly. And in all wisdom, teaching, with Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.
