The Toubredour trucks manufactured by this company, give the highest mileage in the world. They will be available for purchase in the market within the next 45 days. The Toubredour trucks are a game changer that burns and consumes half the fuel, becoming the lowest fuel-consuming truck in the world. Toubredour will not just topple the Indian market… But will also topple the international market. Two German companies and one Japanese company compete to tie up with Vahjra Motors. The result that we see today is because of the eight years we spent on research and development. Sir, the pollution level is higher than the permit table level. - Hello! - Sir. Sorry for troubling you, sir. - You asked me to contact you directly. - Yeah! The pollution level is still a bit higher. In just a day, the Vahjra stocks have seen an 11,37% rise in profit. It is said to be the highest stock rise in history. This rise in stock value makes Vahjra one of the world's leading manufacturers of heavy motor vehicles. Okay, sir. No one should know about this. We have been asked to keep it a secret. Did you get it done? - It's almost done, sir. - How much more time do you need? I gave you this task first thing in the morning. I've been filling in everyone's email addresses into the excel sheet. Why is it taking so long? There are two thousand email addresses to fill in, sir. So? First segregate it, then merge it and send it to me as bulk mail. Perumal? - Perumal! - Sir! - What did I just say? - You asked me to send it as a bulk mail. Do you know how to merge e-mails? Yes, sir. Are you sure? Yes, sir. Okay, I'm gonna stand right here. Segregate and merge the email addresses right now. I want to see you do it. I need to take this call. But you should be done before I'm back. Tell me! Oh, God! Did you complete it? I completed it, sir. What did you say? I completed it! You are Pughaz, right? What is it? You helped me through remote access, right? I did not, sir. I know it was you, sir. The senior manager does not like me at all. It was not my scope of work. Had I said I didn't know it, he would've fired me and recruited one of his own. Thank you for saving me. - Girls, hurry up. Get inside. - Come on, hurry up. - Be quick. - Be careful. Girls, stop rambling. - Oh, no! Hold her! - Get her some water. Oh, my God! My shoes! They are new, Goddammit! Shakthi, hold her hair. Someone, please help her. - Girls! - What is it? Hey-hey! I think she had bloody Mary! She's puking red. Damn! It's a men's room! Oh, no, come on, let's leave. - Hold on! - Could you please go outside? What? You want us to get out of here? We came in here to maintain decorum. Hey, do you want some water? Emergency! Please, guys. Hey! - Let's go! - Dude, this is too much! Watch your step. Even imported liquors ends up as puke. They're shooing away men from the men's washroom. Hard times! - Dude! - Yes? Please guard the door so that no other man enters. Why are you gazing at her? Try it on. We'll return it if it does not fit. Thank you, Auntie. The collar. Turn around. Perfect! It must be freezing in the USA. Especially where you are going. I heard it's minus three degrees. I spoke to my friend yesterday. Here you go. I brought you some thermals too. Here. I don't have cricket practice this Sunday. There's a nice bistro in Nungambakkam. Awesome Mexican food! - Shall we go there? - Shit! What's wrong? Is everything alright? - Maithili? - It's my mom's friend. Oh, okay. When is your flight? Monday! - Don't turn! - Okay! If she tells my mom, I'll be in trouble. I'm going to Tirunelveli tomorrow. I won't be in town. I'm sending you a number. Auntie, the sun's rays are directly hitting your face. Sit here. - It's okay. - Sit here. What's happening? Thank you. I sent it. Check if you received the contact number. - I got it. - That's my friend. She stays in New Haven. If you need any help, please call her. Come! - Sorry! - It's okay, ma'am. Mai! Hi, Auntie! What a pleasant surprise, Auntie. - How are you? - Hi! I spoke to your mother yesterday. - Oh, is it? - What are you doing here? Don't you have a class? I'm waiting for Anu. She's bringing me notes. Thiru! - She's a friend's daughter, Maithili. - Hi! - She's in her final year of medicine. - Hi! This is my nephew, Thiru. He's working as Financial Analyst. He's leaving for the US next week. He's planning to settle down there. Maithili's folks are looking for a match for her. I introduced her to a boy. He is a doctor too. Based out of London. Her parents were really happy. Hey, I got the Bailey's textbook you asked for. You were supposed to take it from me last night. Where were you? We had this research topic discussion last night. So, I couldn't make it. I'll take it from you today. Never mind. The book must be in the car. I'll go find it. Thiru, please come with me. Boyfriend? He proposed to me today. But I did not respond. - What about the suitor your aunt picked? - It won't work out. This, too, won't work out. Let it go! Was I straightforward? You were! Sorry! How is your friend? Which friend? Last night, the party, you know vomit… What happened? A delayed reaction, I think. Now I'm angry. How could you say it won't work out? Don't you think you were being a bit rude? Did I ask for your opinion? How could you pass a remark on my personal matters? What do you know about me? - Just because you're her relative... - I don't know everything about you. But, one thing I know is that you're independent. You do whatever you think is right. You won't do anything blindly just because you're told to. I concur, not many like you. You have very few friends. A bit snobbish! A bit control freak. Extremely organized! Whether it be life or friendship, it should be on your terms. You play the harp well. And you're a bathroom singer. Mai! I found it! He helped so that Bharathi Auntie wouldn't spot me with Dhruv. We didn't speak a word with each other. Practically strangers! And yet, he understood the situation. Think about it. He seemed to be a decent guy. He didn't misuse this opportunity to be friends with me. Neither did he flirt. - So? - So, nothing! That's about it. End of story. It's not like I'm going to meet him again. I'm wondering how he knew so much about me. That too the instant he met me. Hi! Bharathi Auntie told me that I would find you here. How did you find out? Sorry? Whatever you said the other day… Was spot on! Everything was correct. How did you find out? Buy me a cup of coffee. And I'll tell you. Ved, did you watch the news? We are bleeding in the share market. Vahjra's Toubredour trucks are emitting more than the permitted level. Also, we hear that Vahjra is keeping this matter a secret. It has created a shock wave in the market. If this turns out to be true, it'll be a hard blow to Vahjra. We hear this will affect the huge capital that Vahjra was expecting to fund the project. - The German company collaborating… - Sir! - Is about to step down. - It's the minister. Is this true? If it does not pass the emission test… The Toubredour license will get into trouble. Don't blame me later. We hear from known sources, that the manufacturing of Toubredour, will be on hold indefinitely. Any vehicle, before it hits the market… Has to abide by the permitted emission levels. Toubredour fails to meet the permitted emission levels. How did this information get out? Have you heard about thieves who steal corporate secrets? More than seventy gangs like these were found, captured, and disabled worldwide. And yet, the number of gangs that operate without getting caught is unimaginable Sir, I don't get it. What do you mean by corporate secrets? Corporates tend to keep a lot of things secret. One simple example is the balance sheet! A company will be running on a loss, but, it will account as if it's making profits. Why? Sir. To convince the investors? Or it could be to take a loan from the bank. Good! It's called a report card for students. TRP for Television channels. And box office for cinemas. For Public Limited Companies, it's called the share market. For instance, you don't have to speak the truth. Just a rumor about something's wrong with the company is enough. It'll immediately reflect on the share market. So, every company's R&D, take over plans, and investment decisions will only be announced when the time is right. The person who steals this kind of information can make loads of money. One of our staff members is out there selling the company's secrets. Who do they sell it to? To competitors, Mafias! A few governments pay money to buy corporate secrets. Check for yourself what has been happening over the past four years. We were about to takeover a Bio-Chemical company in Bengal. Remember? No one knew about it. But Badani Chemicals beat us to it and took over the company. We thought of it as a coincidence. We were about to import DMT machinery in Madhya Pradesh. Suddenly, the government increased the import duty rates. That worked as an advantage for Nirmaan. We considered that a coincidence too. Everyone is aware of how close the government is to Nirmaan. Take Vahjra as an example. People's TV was the first channel to telecast this news. Who owns the channel? Nirmaan! Yes. Nirmaan is Vahjra's competitor. If you put the numbers together you'll get a clear picture. For the past four years, our P&L statement is showing a loss. I am very sorry to say this. But, if Toubredour is disabled, the company will cripple. Vahjra has 20,000 people working as their permanent staff. And has 53,060 people as their temporary staff. Eighteen Board Members! There's one impostor… Among all of them. He has been selling our company's secrets for the past four years. He's the one who sold Toubredour's secret too. I have hired someone who will detect and find the impostor. I am paid in dollars. But I'm not doing this for money. I love hunting people. Only seven members knew about Toubredour's excessive emissions. Apart from you, I have inquired about the other six as well. Sir, I did not tell anyone. I did not let any information out! The management has already inquired about it. The police inquired about it too. I did not tell anyone. Nishanth! No matter what everybody's confessions are… It depends on how soon one breaks down. Sir, I don't know anything. Sir, I'm not aware of anything! Sir, what are you going to do to me? Sir, what are you going to do? Sir, I don't know anything. I don't know anything. Sir, please let me go. Sir, I don't know anything. I have a two-year-old child, sir. Please, sir. Please don't harm me, sir. The police already arrested me, took me under custody and investigated it. They went through all my emails and phone records. They let me go because I was proven innocent. Sir, you can ask the inspector about it. He will confirm saying I'm innocent. Sir, please ask the inspector! Sir! If you want me to take up this case… I'll only report to you. Direct to you. Done! Please don't do it, sir… No, sir! Pawan! His name is Pawan Sharma! Pawan Sharma from the R&D section! We met at the party after the annual conversion. We were drunk. We were angry, sir. We were outraged. I have been an employee of Vahjra for eleven years. Employees who joined after me got promoted. I was high! I blabbed about the pollution level. Whichever state I go to… My men should have the police support of that state. Done! Who are these people? Even the inspector is intimidated. The SP personally called up and asked us to help them with whatever they needed. Incidents will take place… Jaswant! …but they should not interfere. Oh, God! Your company executives, the R&D staff and the accounts staff, I need everyone's personal files. La lit, Keshav, Hyderabad! Within a month. I will find the thief who has been stealing Vahjra's secrets. Hi, Keshav! Please sit down, Keshav. What is it? Someone has been selling Vahjra's secrets for the past four years. I know that you've been supplying him with the information… For money! I have all the details about your offshore bank account and your transactions. Who are you people? Who am I? Keshav… I can break your backbone right here, right now. I can partially paralyze you… And put you in a wheelchair for the rest of your life. Your son is interested in sports, right? I will cut every nerve on his ankle. I will splash acid on your daughter's face. I will send local thugs for your wife… Please! That's who I am, Keshav! If you answer a simple question of mine… No harm will be done! You will never see me again. If you're okay with it, just nod your head. Who do you supply the secrets of Vahjra to? That's all I wanna know. I never handed over the information in person. I receive an email once every month. I'll load the encrypted data on a pen drive. I will be given a drop point. It will be mostly a bus or a train station. They'll mention a particular seat. I will leave the pen drive there and get off the train at the next stop. I have never seen anyone coming for the pen drive until I get off. That's all I know. I have no idea who's running this operation. That's not enough, Keshav. Give me something! Anything! I swear this is all I know. I am telling you the truth! Please trust me! You must think your daughter is sleeping peacefully at her hostel in Delhi, right? My men are at the same pub your daughter is in. It's a live video call. Please! Please hear me out... - Please… - I'll give you two minutes. Please! I'm begging you. I have no answers! Please don't harm her. I don't know anything. Please hear me out! Please! Spare my daughter! Hari, two minutes are up. Splash it on her eyes. No! What are you going to throw? What are you going to do? Wait! Wait! Wait! Please! Wait! Please give me some time to think. Please wait! Give me a second to think about it, please. Wait! I'm thinking! - I'm thinking! Please! - Throw it on her! Oh my God! Oh my God! Keshav! Keshav? They did not throw the acid at your daughter. It was thrown at her boyfriend. Rakshit! Somebody help! Someone, please help me! - Help! - What happened? - Call the ambulance. - Yeah, I'm trying! - Your daughter is next... - No, don't harm her. My men are waiting at the entrance of the pub. There's one person I suspect. Jayaprakash. He's the Chennai Account Section Chief. One day, when I was getting off after leaving the pen drive, I saw him on the train. I saw him on the train. Secunderabad stop! How does it help? There was no need for him to be there. Nishanth! Pawan! Jaswant! Baruva! La lit! Keshav! Faridabad, Delhi, Calcutta, Bhopal, Hyderabad. All of them are selling the company's secrets, unaware of whom they're selling it to. These Vahjra employees are those who haven't been promoted. Employees who got demoted. Despite being a senior, they're getting paid less. Someone has created a group of whistle-blowers. And, the last link of that chain is… Jayaprakash! He's the Chennai Account Section Chief. - Does JP know? - Even JP doesn't know who it is. I have been following JP for the past ten days. I have hacked his computer. His phones are tapped. Without my knowledge, JP can't call or communicate with anyone. I've hooked the bait. The prey will come to us. GOVERNMENT PRIMARY HEALTH CENTER Did you have your food? How many patients are still out there? There are around 15 to 20 patients. Just get me a cup of coffee. Now tell me. How were you so accurate about me? It's not rocket science. A bit of common sense. A bit of observation. And a bit of your body language. And lastly, your handbag. My handbag? We can tell about a girl from the type of handbag she carries. Do you know that? Like what? Let's take your handbag as an example. It's huge and practical. As far as I know, it must have a charger, tab, purse, lip gloss, keys and energy bars. I'm sure it has everything you may need in an emergency. Am I right? What does that say about you now? It says that you're extremely organized. Imagine this building collapsing, and we are all stuck in here. Whoever is stuck with you, is lucky. You could survive in here for two days. Thanks to your bag. You see that girl right there? That girl has a big friend circle. Your two O'clock. She listens to her heart more than her mind. Your one O'clock That lady has a dominating personality. The one in the green top outside? That girl likes the company of boys. Are you saying all of this based on their handbags? There's a book on it. We can learn about a girl's character based on her handbag. Nonsense! I could get rid of this bag and purchase a new one. Would that change my character? A girl could own a couple of handbags. What would you say about that? Have you ever met or known someone who has gone through a breakup? Whoever they fall in love with next will have a common factor. It may be a physical feature, character, or attitude. There will be something in common. We often tend to get attracted to a particular type of person. It's basic human psychology. The same thing applies here. No matter how many handbags a girl owns, she will only use a particular type of handbag regularly. You were carrying the same handbag to the pub as well. Wasn't a clutch the right accessory to the dress you were wearing? - Bye! - Bye. I wanted to clarify something. I only came here to know how the things you said about me were right. I… I don't want you to… Get the wrong impression! How do I say it? You mean to say that you don't want to take this to the next step. Am I right? Correct! Hey, storm Why are you dissipating me? Why is my heart Rising like a wave? Why am I going up the sky And fluttering like a feather? Why am I deflecting my path And getting lost in sweetness? I have never lost control of myself I never expected you to enter my life She is a burning finger That dances in the strong wind She is a painting Under the cloudy sky A few raindrops become a fire The paintings blossom into flowers Full of color and life The garden dances to the tune of the wind For two pairs of eyes, two hearts And the boundless sky to still extend Did you spread further? Did you wake up? Oh, storm! You are pushing me up and down! Hey, storm! Why are you dissipating me? Why is my heart Rising like a wave? - Did you go see him? - Yes. - Why? - Just. Hold on for a minute. My head is spinning. Your folks have found a guy for you. And there's a guy who has proposed to you. You rejected both of them and now, you're chasing the third one. See, he'll be leaving for the US in the next four days. After a couple of months, I won't even remember who he is. He makes me laugh. And I'm never bored when I'm with him. They have a lot of secrets among themselves. Dirty secrets! Hey, that's my Harp professor! You've completely changed my perception of her. Oh God! How did you know that I play the Harp? Only someone who plays the Harp would have this mark. He's just a time pass. That's about it. Back in the day, men used to treat women as a medium to pass their time. Make up for it on behalf of our generation. The guy who proposed to you the other day… What's up with him? You did say that it wouldn't work out, right? It did not. How did you figure that out? You're independent! He seemed uncomfortable when it came to independent women. That's it! Why did she reject the alliance Bharathi brought her? How do I know? Staring into my eyes brushing my hair You showered love You embraced me And spoke of intimacy Your toes are burning my back like fire Your lips are caressing my face Should I burn or should I get drenched? My body is confused Should I be happy? Or should I cry? The pain causes so much pleasure Hey, storm! You are tearing my heart into two pieces Hey, storm Why are you dissipating me? - Hi! - Shall I leave? No! Why is my heart… Rising like a wave? Why am I going up the sky And fluttering like a feather? Mai, this isn't a bag hanger. It's a Mook Jong! - It's used while practicing Martial Arts. - Oh, sorry! -I have never lost control of myself -I have never lost control of myself I was never expecting you until now I was never expecting you! - Did you get your visa? - Yes. So this time next week… I'll be in New York! Bharathi Auntie mentioned you don't intend to return. Yes. I have applied for a Green Card. You? After two years… I will be working in a remote village. There are many doctors in town to treat the rich. You can follow me on FB if you wanna know where I am. So, that's it, then! Five days flew in no time. We'll meet again if we cross paths in the future. Best wishes! Go chase your dreams. What the hell? I never expected that I'd do something like it. I thought he was just someone you could pass time with. I thought so too. You said you'd never meet him again. But, you went and met him. You didn't want to take this to the next level… But ended up sending him a friend request. Is he interested in you? Yes! I'm sure about it. He's just not expressing it. Did you propose to Maithili? Don't you like her? I like her a lot. That's why I didn't propose. Be frank with him. When is he leaving for the US? Tomorrow! Then go and meet him today. Once your class is over, go to his house and talk to him. Hi, Maithili. When you get this message, I would've left Chennai. I wanted to tell you this in person. But, I couldn't. I deleted this message many times before recording. I wonder if I'm speaking my heart. I want you to be happy. I wish your dreams and your desires come true. If I'm part of your life, I'll become a hurdle to you. We're running late for the flight. You may be hurt. But I believe it's for your good. He deactivated all of his social media accounts. - Did you check with Bharathi ma'am? - She has no idea about it. Why would he erase everything before he left? He left without leaving a trace behind. JP has received a weird email. The IP address shows as Japan. Fake! I think it's our guy. Has JP replied to the email? Yes! There is going to be a meeting. Sir, the next meeting is about to happen. JP is en route to Trichy to meet his contact. Two of my men are traveling in the same compartment as JP. Tomorrow morning, six of my men will be waiting for him at the station. Everyone has body cams on them. Why do we need such an extensive setup? It's not like we are going to seize James Bond. It does not matter where the drop point is. No one can take away the pen drive and escape. When JP arrives at Trichy, I'll be there. It's going to be a simple affair, sir. We will be done in two hours. All six camera feeds. Arjun, we will get our guy today. Raju! He left the newspaper in here. There's an envelope inside it. That's it! The pen drive is inside that envelope. Wait right over there. Whoever comes for the envelope… Is the guy we are looking for. JP has received a weird email. The IP address shows as Japan. Fake! I think it's our guy. Has JP replied to the email? Yes! Can you repeat that after me? So, that means "Who is Mr. Jin?" So who is Ms. Jim in? How do you say that in Korean? I'm scared! This is not the first time, Shalu. I get that it's not our first time. But this time, it's different. There are only two ways they could catch us. One, they should know our original names. And two, capture our families to weaken us. These details are not available in the public domain. We are ghosts! In case I get caught… You and the child will be safe. That gave me the courage to take this up. Be cool, Shalu. We'll grow old together and die. Leave home by 10:00 p.m. tonight. I'll meet you at the usual spot. I'm finding it hard to live away from you. Two more weeks. After that, we'll be far away from Chennai. JP will reach Trichy in the morning. We should be there. Remember, we have to leave tonight. Stay strong. If I don't return in thirty minutes… Don't wait for me. Ma'am! Hey, hold on! Here you go. Take this. Stay blessed, ma'am. - How much is it? - It's five rupees, sir. I think he has given something to the kid. Run, Shwetha! Run! Raju, you stay right there. The others surround JP. That is JP's return train. I thought you said that was JP's train. But he's going the other way. - Fifteen rupees. - That is his train. How come you don't have change? - I can give you change. Here you go. - Thank you, sir. - Here you go. - Thank you, sir. You're welcome, sir. Joe! The train has left. But why is JP still waiting on the platform? Van it ha? - Can you see Jayaprakash? - Yes! - Which one is Vanitha's cam? - This one! Zoom it! The guy has another phone! They are playing a game. The pen drive could be inside the bathroom. Or it could be with the groundnut vendor. It could be with the man wearing a checked shirt. Or it's still with Jayaprakash. Listen, everyone! The guy we're looking for is somewhere around. He has been giving instructions to JP. Check whoever is on the phone. If the pen drive is still with JP, the guy will come to JP. Keep watching JP! The man is missing. I've lost him! Can anyone see JP? Hey, Rafeeq! He's on the foot over bridge. Rafeeq! Hey! Rafeeq is down! Hey! I got it. Start the car! He was captured on a CCTV camera. Look at the man in the black shirt. Watch now! He pick pockets the pen drive. Even JP is unaware that he's the contact. The catch is we can see the man. But the face is unclear. Why did you run? When he paid me, I found this. I ran because he might realize and ask for it back. What did he tell you? "I'll pay you 10,000 rupees." "Don't ask any questions and leave right away." Sir, I handed over all the clips to your men. He got recorded only in these four clips. His face isn't clear in any of these clips. He knew where the CCTV cameras were installed. He made sure his face was not captured. - He came from the side. - I could not see his face. We returned home safe! Why are you crying? We did it! Didn't we? Listen, we are safe now! You don't have to be afraid anymore. That's him! He's the guy we are looking for. You are wrong, Reba! Look at this. - What is the time? - It's 9:17 a.m. This was the clip when Rafeeq got knocked down. What's the time? It's 9:17 a.m. When Rafeeq got knocked down, this man was not there. There's another guy. They both belong to the same team. First, one guy arrives at the spot. He does a recon to check if it's safe. After that, the second guy arrives. That's how they work. It's the other guy who has identified our men. It's a trap! What? There are eight people, and they're well-trained. It's the other guy who has been giving him instructions. Shalu is waiting for me outside, Thiru. Shall we abort the plan? Tell me, Thiru! Shall we abort the plan? Don't get worked up! Nothing will happen to you or Shalu. Do as I say! Until I say so, don't go near JP. It's the other guy who gave instructions to JP as well. Go to the restroom. Leave the newspaper inside. Groundnuts! - Stop the boy! - Groundnuts! He made a note of all the CCTV cameras. It was he who messed up our entire plan. Hey, Rafeeq! He's on the foot over bridge. Gandhi, head towards JP now. - JP sir! - Yes! Board the train going to Arakkonam. He is the mastermind. It's him who we are looking for. So, what do we do now? I'm going to find his original identity. Once I find it… "I can't take it. Please kill me." I'm going to record him saying that… And send the video to Ved! Vahjra is aware of their secrets getting leaked. Vahjra hired that team. - Eight people? - Yes! It's a new team! None of them are in our database. Bye, sir. Make sure no one knows that I helped you. Any updates, sir? I checked with my sources in IB. No one has any idea about the team Vahjra hired for the investigation. Give me more time. I'll keep digging. In the meanwhile, you tread carefully. Thiru, they were not following me. I took all the precautions. JP! They followed JP. - Is JP safe? - He's safe! No one noticed… The train JP boarded. Only after JP boarded the train safely… I left the station. - JP sir! - Yes! - Board the train going to Arakkonam. - Okay! TIRUCHCHIRAPPALLI Hi, JP! Where is JP now? Arakkonam! He has a childhood friend living in Arakkonam that no one knows of. His passport will be ready in two days. I have made all the arrangements for him to leave for Frankfurt. First of all, even JP does not know who we are. After JP leaves for Frankfurt, we won't have anything to do with him. JP will be safe. We too will be safe. There's nothing to be afraid of. I am already dying. I'm diagnosed with Advanced Pancreatic Cancer. You can't cause me any more pain. - I already have enough... - JP! Not just your medical history… I've studied your entire biography. You have a son. He is married and settled in the US. He has three beautiful children. He's in Jaisalmer for a vacation along with his family. Here are the details of the hotel that they're staying in. Here are the pictures of your daughter who's studying in London. They were captured over the last week. It be from home to college… Or from college to home. She commutes alone on a cycle. How safe is that, Jayaprakash? If they've followed JP by any chance… I believe our entire network is exposed. It's just like catching a fish and then releasing it back into the pond. He extracted information from everyone and sent them back to work. Your source shouldn't know what happened out here. She's the daughter of an auditor who stole information from my client. She's twenty-four years old, just like your daughter. Please let me go! Please! You could not watch it for more than two minutes. But this is a twelve-hour clip. I can't help it. It was six of my boys! Everyone wanted a turn! Only after that, the real torture began. The complete video is available on the dark net. I can send it to you. I sent this video to her father. This is the last video he watched before he committed suicide. Until today the police could not find any evidence. They won't find it! Please spare me! No! Please stop! JP, we need your confession. You are wealthy enough. Why did you steal Vahjra's secrets? Do you know where Vahjra's truck factory is located? Faridabad! Yes! A few years ago… It was a logistics factory. The government owned it. The factory was incurring losses, so the government sold it to Vahjra. The land, infrastructure, and machinery alone are worth 3500 crore rupees. But the government sold it to Vahjra for 1800 crore rupees. The government sold government properties at a loss. Do you know why? You talk about buying people's votes. But corporates are buying political parties instead. The first thing Vahjra did after buying the government factory was to lay off 400 workers. Everyone ran to grab any job they could find. Result? Unorganized sector. The job that paid daily wages… Was destroyed in the future. The chain reaction did not stop there. Around 2200 kilometers away in Karnataka, Tumakuru was a medium-scale factory. It used to manufacture spare parts for the government factory. Once Vahjra took over, they canceled the Tumakuru factory contract. Two hundred people lost their jobs. At present, the Tumakuru factory is shut down. This affected a small-scale industry 400 kilometers away in Guindy, Chennai. It was a small factory that entirely was dependent on the Tumakuru factory. The factory owner did not know how to recoup the losses. He owned houses that were put on rent. He increased the rent. Sir, how will I manage my finances if you increase the rent? The retired school teacher who could not manage the high rent… Cut his wife's medical budget in half. Followed by his groceries budget. Another soul that was affected due to the Guindy factory shutting down was an older lady! Her daughter ran a tea shop… That was dependent on the business of the workers of the Guindy factory. The tea shop is still out there. But the business is shut down. She had to pay the loan sharks and the thugs from her savings. Her daughter has lost everything in her life. And yet, she hasn't been able to clear her debt. The older lady has started working as a maid to cover the expenses. She is 67 years old. The reason for all of it is… The takeover that happened in Faridabad. Neither the older man knew about this nor the older woman knew. This is a story of only two people. But when a Government factory is sold to a Private company… Directly or indirectly, thousands of poor people's lives get affected. At the same time, Vahjra, which bought the government factory… Saw a 20% increase in profit! Thousands of souls have lost everything and are on the streets today. The Government is silent. Small-scale businesses are getting crushed. Yet, the government is silent. Why? Corporate funding! When they bend the rules to support the corporates, corporate funding does its job. All the political parties… Doesn't matter if it's a big or a small party. They are requested to account for their source of funds. That is when you'll know who they are working for. How does stealing corporate secrets make everything right? I'm not stealing secrets to sell them. I'm giving it to an international group of whistle-blowers. Not just Vahjra… I give them information about every trespass corporate companies do. They have been compiling information. The complete information will soon be out in international publications. We are going to upload it on the internet. I am not doing this for money. JP… You just want to do something good before you die. But the people who are taking information from you are not the whistle-blowers you peg them for. They are a network that steals and sells corporate secrets. I am looking for the leader of that network. Those eight people were just the operatives. They have a Chief above them. Before he could get to us, we need to complete the job and leave safely. A few unknown officers from IB are their conduit. With their help, they're selling the secrets to the competitors. Once I get hold of the leader, I'll get to the officers too. Thiru, Vahjra is striking back. They're going to use full force! If we get caught… They won't even spare our child. They are all Vahjra employees. Not just you. These people are also supplying information to your source in exchange for money. I concur you weren't aware of this. You got cheated on, JP. Give me something, JP. Anything! I don't know. I have never met him. I don't know his original name. Every time he spoke to me, he used a voice changer. This is eight years of planning, Shalu. Don't be afraid. No one can crack our identities. Think! You were in touch with him for approximately a year. There has to be something, JP. I'm not sure if this is going to be useful to you. But once, while I was talking to him over the phone I heard someone speak in the Korean language in the backdrop. I worked in Seoul for a while. So I could recognize the language. It sounded like a classroom. How many Korean coaching centers do you think there are in Chennai? Check if someone from Vahjra has been taking Korean classes. JP? Make sure they don't find his body. Hey, Mai! Stay still. What is it? You look very pretty with this sunlight hitting your face. You look just like a painting. Stay still! I want to click a picture. For memories sake. - Get lost! - Mai, please, hey! - What? - Your hand… Place your hand just like you did before. - Like this? - Exactly! How long do you want me to stay like this? - Hurry up, click the picture. - I did. And it'll never be erased. It's for my memories. - I think it'll take time. - Fifteen minutes! That's why I wanted to cook. We would've had our meal. Do you know something? What should I know? You were telling me something… And stopped halfway. Won't it get prolonged You being the reason? Aren't you the reason For my unbearable longing? I'm lost into your eyes voluntarily I'm lost in your eyes voluntarily Though I know the route to get back I refuse to get out Won't the moments With you get prolonged? I freeze at the moment of melting Mai, check out the profiles before you leave. - Mom, I'm running late. - I said to check them out! Hey, show it to her. I'm working on my project report, Mom. Dad, please buy mom a new laptop. My laptop is filled with matrimony details. It's embarrassing! I've shortlisted six profiles for you. Two of them are IAS officers. Two are doctors. Also, there's a profile of a guy working at NASA. Check every profile patiently. I don't like any of them. Dad, if this is how women pick their potential grooms… Boys like me will never get married. The kids from the 50s are the luckiest. Look, even you got married! - Why are you throwing your life away, Mai? - What? Your mom called up and was rambling at me. She sent me the details of all the prospective grooms she picked for you. She asked me what was wrong with the profiles. She's a poor thing. Why are you rejecting them all? No matter who it is, I end up comparing him with Thiru. If I keep comparing my to-be husband with Thiru my entire life… That's not a life, Priya! He left without saying anything. I wonder why he left abruptly. In all these years, has he ever called you? I've been asking myself the same question. I want to forget everything and move on! But, I'm not able to. There are approximately twenty Korean coaching centers in Chennai. We checked the CCTV footage from all the centers. Among them, twelve complexes hold recordings only for 24 hours. Only two complexes have footage for the past six months. This is one of the pieces of footage. This was recorded four months ago. Only he visited here from Vahjra. His name is Karthick. He's from the accounts section. - Shalu! - Yeah? I'm gonna be home for lunch. Thiru? I called JP's friend, from Arakkonam. He said JP never made it. We are being hunted without our knowledge. Come to our safe house. I couldn't hack his phone. It was he who pick-pocketed JP. Same height. Same built. Start the car. Ask Shalu to raise a good child. And you too stay safe. Gandhi! His phone. It's broken beyond use. Bring him to our warehouse. Thiru, you look broken. What would you do without me? Come on. Is it possible for me to see his body? Shalu, they'll use his body as a trap. Did anyone claim the body? Our men are waiting at the mortuary. Do you mean to say he's lying dead as an orphan? His name, his address… Everything is fake. He applied for the job using fake documents. - Did you check his pockets? - That's all we could find. Bus ticket? Metro Ticket? Nothing, Arjun! Only if we know about him, we can identify the other person. The Korean Institute JP mentioned. What was the purpose of the visit? Was he a student? Or did he go there to meet someone? Hey! Shalu! Take me to the institute. Here, drink this. How did he find out? I'm wondering the same thing. - Who's Varsha? - My friend! She works at the travel agency next to my Korean class. Answer your phone. A few men are here at the complex asking questions about Gandhi. I've never seen him. That means he's not a student. He was here to meet someone. He will check the teacher's list. There are a total of three teachers. It's been four months since one teacher left for the US. A new teacher joined us last month. There's one lady teacher, Dhansika. She's pregnant and is on medical leave. - How long since she joined? - It's been a year. He will get your address. Number 32, Soundarajan Street, Annanagar. Thank you! Lock the doors! Don't open it for anyone. Fake address! There's no house under that number. They've been planning this for years. Systematically, he destroyed his identity. Despite having caught one, we're not able to trace the other person. He didn't spare any clue. How do we look for someone who has no identity? When I hunt, I don't miss it! Let's go to the mortuary. I saw the face of the man who was hunting me. I'm sending you his picture now. Run, Thiru! Right now! And don't look back! Who the hell is he? His name is, Arjun. He's an Indian Army Ex-Commando. You can't find his name in a telephone directory. There's no website or registered office. But seventeen multinational companies are his clients. Providing security to corporates, and hunting down corporate thieves is his business. Shahdol, Central India. A state that's rich in bauxite deposits. To get their hands on the bauxite, a couple of corporate companies competed with each other. But, the local tribes refused to give away nature's gift. For six years, the corporate wasn't able to… Subjugate the protest staged by the tribals. One of the corporates hired Arjun! Within four months, he subjugated the protests! Do you know how? Eight villages went missing. Arjun was arrested and sent to prison. Arjun is a pathological killer. Three Government doctors certified it and asked to sentence him to life. He was backed by a strong corporate support. Within two months, he got out of prison. For a few corporates, the system itself works as hired guns. Sir, my work is not done yet. Thiru, do you want your loved ones to be safe or not? Then it's time to start running! Corporates hire Arjun not to catch the culprits… But to destroy them without a trace. I thought you said there was no clue. His body is the clue. - Find out about this wound. - Okay, sir! Thiru, he found his way to Gandhi. It won't take him much time to identify you or your loved ones. If I were to know that Arjun is looking for me… I would secure my family first… And then would commit suicide. Hereafter, if you call me, I won't pick up! I'll give you a tip. You should secure your loved ones in a safe house. Because he'll use them one by one to get to you. If I'm right, I'll know about his history in just two days. Shalu, we have to leave right away. I have made arrangements for you to leave for Lisbon. What about you? It's not safe for me to take the flight. I'm making alternate arrangements. My aunt stays at my native. I will bring her along and leave in two days. This scar is from a surgery. Perhaps he broke his clavicle bone. They've used a plate to fix it. Every plate has a serial number. You can use the serial number to determine which hospital the surgery took place in. Why don't you use your contacts? If you find the hospital, you can identify the patient. No one should know that I gave you this file. - Tell me! - Arjun. The original name of the deceased is Gandhi. His native is Tirunelveli. He got married eight years ago. His wife's name is Shalini. Either they are divorced. Or they stay at different addresses. We are not able to locate his wife at the moment. But listen, a person named Thiru signed as a witness for their marriage. I have collected Thiru's entire details too. Thiru and Gandhi studied together at BITS Pilani. I'm calling you from the same college. They're best friends! They used to be college toppers! Thiru worked at Morgan Stanley, USA. Gandhi worked as an Executive at ADB, Hong Kong. Both are experts in international finance. They returned to India five years ago. They joined Vahjra under fake identities. Since that day, they were never in contact outwardly. I'm sending you Thiru's picture. Without a doubt… Thiru is the man we are looking for! Hey, buddy! I have shared his address. Arjun, it looks like they left in a hurry. Chief! There's a secret safe behind the bookshelf. That's 1,25,000 USD Plus, eight international passports. - Do you know where Thiru is? - No! But a woman named Bharathi… Has signed as a legal guardian on his college documents. That lady should know everything about Thiru. I found her location. Thiru! I have bad news! Gandhi is dead, Auntie! We will have to leave right away. I am waiting at the coast. I'm sending you the address. Get here. The boat will leave in the morning. I'll use that lady to find Thiru. Arjun, our men called from Bharathi's house. Bharathi committed suicide. She burned down her mobile phone and laptop. Don't be sad, Thiru. This is for the greater good! They'll use me to get to you. Let the thread end with me. Hereafter, they won't be able to get to you. You are free! Tomorrow, you leave safe and sound. Start a new life. No one can win the corporates like Vahjra. It's a great thing that we made it this far. I request you to do one thing. Before you leave, please call Maithili. I'll share her number. Thinking of you, she never got married. I'll see you. Please, Thiru, give her a call. This is my last wish! Hello! Mai… This is Thiru. Tell me! Bharathi Auntie is dead, Mai! What?! Do you have ten minutes? I want to tell you about me. SENJOLAI ORPHANAGE What is your name? That's Gandhi! Hi! That's it. I told you everything about me. I told you everything about myself and my life. Eight years ago, I left without any explanation. I don't want to repeat the same mistake. Now you'd understand why I left without an explanation. I'm sorry, Maithili… For all the pain that I have caused you. Bye, Maithili. I'm leaving in the morning. I can never return. Be well! Bye! Won't it get prolonged You being the reason? Aren't you the reason For my unbearable longing? I'm lost… In your eyes voluntarily Though I know the route to get back I refuse to get out Won't the moments… With you get prolonged? I freeze at the moment of melting - Hello! - Mai? Take me with you. No, Mai. That won't be sensible. I don't care if it's sensible or not. I'm coming with you, that's it! I'll call you back in ten minutes. Mai. For the past eight years, I've been thinking of you. You've called me out of the blue. And now… You're leaving for good. I'm not able to think straight. I just want to come running to you! I remember telling you… That I'd work in a village that has no medical facilities. - Do you remember? - Yes! I'm living that dream now! I'm the only duty doctor here. And there are many urgent cases here. All the patients are dependent on me. I did not want to cry. But I could not control it. I don't think I can come, Thiru. I want to. But I can't. This is my life. This is my ambition. This is what I am! Stay! It's the right decision. At this moment, I'm disgusted with myself. I've been confusing you despite knowing your situation. Don't feel that way. I totally understand what you're going through. Don't cry! Could you please do one thing for me? Before you leave… I want to meet you one last time. One last time! Please tell me where you are. Before you… Or after you… There's not going to be another man in my life. What about you? Are you going to have another woman in your life? There's no one but you! It wasn't easy. But I retrieved Bharathi's FB data. Most of her friends are her students. But only one girl had this picture. Who are you, people? Where is Thiru? Who is Thiru? Him! Where is he? I don't have any contact with him. This is an old picture. I have no idea where he is. I'm not sure if he's even alive. I followed every link, and I'm here now. You are the only one left between Thiru and me. Where is Thiru? I don't know. Your eyes give away the lie. Five seconds. Where is Thiru? Mom! Break her hand. Mom! Mom! Mom! Five seconds. Where is Thiru? Break another hand. Choose! Your mother or Thiru? Five seconds! Break her neck. Wait! Wait… Wait! Wait! - Where is Thiru? - Wait! Sorry, Thiru! Sorry, Thiru! They hurt my family. They broke my mother's hand. They threatened to kill my mom if I didn't give up your location. Sorry, Thiru! Forgive me, Thiru! Sorry, Thiru! Spare Maithili. I'll do as you say. I killed you myself! Bring her here. No one should know what went down here. If you fail to upkeep, you'd have to see my face again. - Go, Mai! - No, take me along. Please don't speak about them to anyone. You and your family will be safe until you keep your mouth shut. I am coming with you! Thiru, don't leave me! I am very sorry about your mother. Hey, take me along with him. Thiru, don't do this. I am coming too. Please don't leave me. They will kill you! They will kill you! They will kill you! Thiru, don't go! They will kill you! Thiru! Thiru, don't go! Thiru, please don't go. Don't leave me. They will kill you, Thiru. Thiru! Take me along and kill me too. Please take me along. Kill me too! Thiru! Thiru! Thiru! Take me along! Kill me too! Arjun, the GPS isn't working. I lost my way. Where will we get good network? There's a factory on the left. The network is good there. Stop the car. - Hello! - We got him. I want a full video of him confessing. He's asking for a full video of you confessing. Park the car over there. Your name? Thirumaran. Native? Ayyanarkuruchi. Parents? My parents are dead. Bharathi? She adopted me. I learned about your history from your college. But I don't know anything about you before college. Tell me about your childhood. Break all his fingers! Break his knees. Cut down his ankles. Record everything until the last breath. THIRUMARAN First, wake him up. Then, break his fingers. He should be able to feel the pain. The older boys beat him up the entire night. He's incurred two fractures! He didn't even scream a word. Hey! He passed out! Beat him until he regains consciousness. - What are you looking for? - My knife! Tell me. I'm calling from the orphanage Thiru grew up in. I have additional information about him. From the age of six to ten, he studied in a school at Ayyanarkuruchi. Both his parents are chemical engineers. They used to work at the chemical factory in that village. Union Chemicals and Gases PVT. LTD. Guess what? Bharathi's husband worked at the same factory as a Chief Engineer. Gandhi's father worked there as a Chemist. All three families have this one thing in common. Arjun, do you know where we are now? Ayyanarkuruchi! UNION CHEMICALS AND GASES PVT. LTD. AYYANARKURUCHI - Native? - Ayyanarkuruchi. Union Chemicals and Gases PVT. LTD. This factory started in the year 1961. All the surrounding districts were dependent on this factory. - It got shut down in 2001. - Why? Due to pollution! The land, water and air were destroyed. In addition to that, there was industrial wastage. Not just one or two. It was 2,5 lakh tonnes. They dumped everything into the factory's land. It's still rotting out there! Only 0,5 mg chromium is permissible in water. But that village has 20mg of it in the water. Many people in the village were affected by cancer. Even the doctors were unaware of the diseases. Disabled children were born. Bharathi's husband and Gandhi's dad filed a complaint against the company to the Government. It was confidential! In a week, both of them died in recurring accidents. A year later, Thiru's father filed a secret petition to the collector. Three days later… Thiru's parents died in a similar accident. Mom! Dad! Bharathi did claim that it was not an accident but a murder. Neither did the police file a complaint, nor was the press bothered. Ayyanarkuruchi is a ghost town now! Who owned the factory? Vahjra! What is it, Arjun? This village was ground zero. This is where Thiru's parents worked. His aim is not to make money off Vahjra. He sees Vahjra as the corporate that killed his parents and destroyed the village. He aims to cripple Vahjra! What is this? Look, he's back! - Looks like he needs more beating. - Oh, him! - Hey! - Watch me now! One person fighting… Multiple people… Is only possible in movies, despite you knowing the art. Perhaps, you can fight three at once. - Guns? - Three! You won't need it, Arjun! The other day, we were eight people. Gandhi was a trained fighter. I knew it from his stance. He could not even fight eight people. Today, we are fourteen in number. I will upload Thiru's death on the dark net tonight. If there are more than four fighters… Run! He will try to run. Block all exits! He should not be able to escape. This factory where his parents worked… Should be Thiru's tombstone. Look for him everywhere. There are gas masks in the lab right here. Everyone get to the lab! Look for it everywhere. There are two masks inside the drawer. Check every cupboard and locker. Sorry, there are no other masks. That's it. There's no more. I found only one here. Hey! You're dead meat! Don't step in the sun. This is not dust. It's some sort of chemical. Once it comes in contact with the sun… It catches fire! He dumped it on the masks and let us find it. So here's the deal! No one steps in the sun. Don't take off your masks! Now hunt! We can take off the masks now. It's safe! Hey! A few stairs are rusted. He knows which step is safe and which isn't. There's no other way up. He is bleeding. I got him! In three hours, he will pass out. Follow the steps he took. Phosphorus? Chemical cocktail. Arjun! He is here! What would've happened if I did not arrive at the factory? I would've died! Even now, it's enough if I stay put. You'll die in the next two hours. Today, right here, we are both going to die, Arjun. But I will make sure to kill you before I die. There's no use of the gun. You are visible to me. But I know I'm not visible to you. To kill me… You have to come closer. There's a sun patch in your way. What will you do now? You were going to use Toubredour to disable Vahjra. Let me tell you something you don't know. TVG, a German start-up company, has invented a technique to reduce up to 40% emission. As this start-up was bought by a Russian family Vahjra signed an agreement with them yesterday. In the next thirty days… Toubredour will hit the market. Your entire life went down the drain. I have come this far. Why are you still holding the knife? You're losing strength. I know you're waiting for me to get closer. Let me tell you something you don't know, Arjun. Bharathi did not just adopt Gandhi and me. She adopted another kid as well. Vel Murugan! Vel Murugan is the Chairman of the TVG start-up company. Vahjra does not know… That we sold the TVG technology to a Russian Mafia shell company. The news about Vahjra's tie-up with the Russian Mafia will be out in two weeks. After that, Vahjra won't be able to recoup at all. We've been planning this for eight years now. Wing Chun! I noticed a Mook Jong at your house. That's a lame martial art. Mixed martial art. That is practical. Kung fu, Karate, Taekwondo. They all are the same. You can learn one form or can learn all three. That's your wish! But do you know what will help you win a fight? You will pass out in a while. I'm going to beat you for ten minutes. Ten minutes later, I'll rip your intestines and show it to you before you die. Don't ever forget what Bruce Lee once quoted. "I fear not the person who knows 10,000 art forms." One form. One punch. One kick. "But I fear the person who has practiced one thing 10,000 times." Your willpower is stronger than your physical strength. If you focus on something… Nothing else seems to be visible to you. You won't lose… In any fight! A Rebel Leader A Rebel Leader Vahjra's CEO, Vaid Tiwari, had suffered a cardiac arrest and had been admitted to the hospital. As Vahjra's association with the Russian Mafia was exposed, their family businesses in America and Europe have been shut down and sealed. HONOR THE LULLABY HE LISTENED TO DEATH THE GAME HE PLAYED SENJOLAI ORPHANAGE We received a donation of one crore rupees, madam. We have no idea who donated it.
