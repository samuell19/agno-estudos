what we do know is that a 9-1-1 call was placed at about 10 p.m this evening and that this is the home of the menendez family police spokesman will be getting a statement in about 30 minutes and what we've been able to gather so far the bodies of recording industry executive jose menendez and his wife kitty were discovered by their two sons when the boys returned home tonight one officer we spoke with said off the record that the couple may have been shot as many as 20 times but department spokesman aren't confirming that for the time being [Music] [Applause] uh i don't think this is such a good place to talk we say we go outside huh [Music] give me a good idea you're lyle that's right you tell me what happened my brother and i we went to a movie we're going to meet some friends but eric forgot his id so driver's license oh fake id he's underage so we figured we'd order some drinks and uh we came back to pick it up and uh we found uh that anybody see you at this movie you were at batman century city i'm sure someone did shouldn't be any problem then you guys uh don't have any idea who might have want to do something like this for your parents um my father is in the music

patience is plural they're two sons they're my patients no one is using the term execution according to a copy of the medical examiner's report we've been able to see that may be precisely what happened at the beverly hills home of record company executive jose menendez and his wife kitty sunday night this is the presidential it's solid gold i think you can safely say it's the ultimate watch

see something in stainless steel you know for every day yes two of them what did my father believe in let me read you a letter that he wrote me when i was away at school i believe he wrote that both you and eric make a difference i believe that you will i encourage you not to select the easy road i urge you to walk with honor regardless of the consequences and to challenge yourself to excellence my father believed in excellence he believed in accomplishment show me what you can do that was my father's creed that was how he brought us up to show him what we could do and to believe in ourselves to know that great things are possible for a man daring enough to try that's my father's legacy and i will always be grateful to him for that i loved him i loved him very much he was a great man a

course it leaves me responsible for this state eric god isn't that hard in a sense uh on the other hand i've been waiting so long to be in a position like this that this transition comes easy anybody the idea that it was a hit mess like that in the head it's not a mobby then what cult i don't know what do you think bloody enough but that's about it so what does that lay the kids the kids you know

them so no one can get them back no one can know they're over there all you've got to do is tell me what you want to raise although police continue to trace the possibility that the brutal murders of record executive jose menendez and his wife kitty in their beverly hills home was the work of organized crime sources in the department admit they're coming up empty according to these sources the brutality of the killing seems inconsistent with a gang land pit you want to get the hell off my property keep rolling we're just filing a story uh you're eric menendez aren't you move the truck if you could answer a couple no no questions turn your cameras off just a couple of questions mr menendez people are really sick you know that they feel like ghoulish don't you think i've suffered enough

that i want to help you i'm trying to help you the hell with all of you i mean remember we had trouble with the burglaries he helped us out so you just went and told him everything i had to talk to somebody i mean i was going crazy it's gonna be fine it is i'll just go see him a couple times and i'll be fine how's the restaurant [Music] i think we got a chance to talk you're gonna go back soon no i'm gonna stay and keep an eye on you [Music] mr cignarelli all right really glad you could come really appreciate this come on let's find some christmas stuff i don't feel like please friend aren't you what can you tell me about what you like he's a nice guy he's a terrific athlete he's smart i like him a lot i don't know what to tell you how did he get along with his parents did they fight a lot i guess i'm sure i don't know did you ever hear him say anything about wishing that his parents were dead or anything like that look i'm not sure what i should say i mean i didn't talk to my dad or a lawyer or anything what are you under any apprehension that you're suspect in this case no no of course why would you need a lawyer i didn't say i needed a lawyer i just i don't know okay he's a friend of mine that's all i just i don't want to say anything to get a friend in trouble what kind of trouble look i don't know what i'm supposed to do here we're friends that's all friends that's all and friends do things together huh well what kind of things did you do together i don't know tennis swimming we wrote scripts you wrote scripts oh one script really that's all what was it about just a movie script what was it about mr signal riley it was it was about a kid who kills his parents okay the patient exhibits no apprehension concerning the purchase of the shotguns which he feels are untraceable because he used a false id nevertheless he seems in general to be in a deeply conflicted emotional state and has considerable difficulty expressing that conflict aren't you going home tonight i haven't made up my mind well i'd really rather you didn't stay the night i wish you would be more positive about our relationship gentlemen and these are not easy times but they're not easy at all i'm in danger you're in danger how can i be in danger they don't even know who i am unless maybe they followed you here or something the patience manner seems to be sullen and morose which i attribute to the tension that he's been under and from time to time he expresses sentiments of remorse i appreciate your coming lyle and i know how you feel about your brother talking to me i i just want to assure you that you couldn't be more wrong that's not why you said you wanted to talk to me no it's not look i'm aware that you think i represent a danger to you but the fact of the matter is you're a danger to me and that danger has to be eliminated because i will not choose to live my life in fear neither did my father but it seems to me that there is a way to eliminate that fear i doubt it i'm just gonna turn that on and i'd like you both to tell me in your own words exactly what happened the night your parents were killed you're crazy you know that come on eric let's go look what happens if the police break this case downtown don't be in such a hurry i can help you if you tell me what happened is there anyone else in a position to help you like i can what are you talking about well look let's let's examine the dynamics of this situation what are we all afraid of you're afraid that i might tell the police what i know and i'm afraid that you might kill me to keep that from happening and that's not exactly a baseless fear get to the point well the point is what's going to happen if you get caught go to prison you're kidding yourself you'll go to the gas chamber but i think i can stop that from happening how because i'm your therapist because my testimony could help you avoid a conviction on psychological grounds and at the very least it'll keep you out of the gas chamber on the catch is uh this little recording you want us to make so i feel safe knowing that you know that if anything happens to me this will become public and we have to look after ourselves lyle this tape protects me it could protect you and that sounds like a good proposition for all three of us in the event that you ever come to trial anything that you say or tell this machine could be helpful help mitigate may i help you i talked to my father and his lawyer i said i should talk to you he said lyle was worried that there might have been another will you know his father might have changed the will or making changes he checked his father's computer but he couldn't find anything right but he wasn't sure so he hired a guy to come out to the house and erase everything do you know who this guy was the guy he hired no what else would he say he told me they shot them he said lyle handed him the gun and they went in and they ran into the room and lyle started shooting he was shooting his father and he looked at eric and said shoot mom and he did look i am tired i just want to go to bed no i don't want to take anything i am just going to go to sleep ok no it's not going to work i don't want to see you why can't you just accept that it's all working top of the line all right now you know what you're gonna do right hmm you've been playing what two years now what do you think's my game getting any better yeah i used to beat you once in a while exactly now we're just gonna find the right tournament i'm ready listen eric i gotta tell you police called me and then they're asking a lot of questions you didn't you didn't say anything to him did you yeah sure right i told him you killed your parents no you better not did you [Music] no there open the door to the run i've got to talk to you open the door i know what you're thinking you want to go to the police but you can't do that judalan you've got to listen to me you can't do that [Music] juvenile you'll be

then what's regulation on that no one seems to know that said give it to him it makes me think it's not all gonna be this easy you've both been charged with two counts of murder both charges carry the special circumstances for which you could be sentenced to death eric gaylen menendez how do you plead not guilty your honor joseph lyle menendez to the charges in the amended indictment how do you plead not guilty given the choice would you rather be good or lucky i'd rather be done remember the woman said ozil said they said ozil said they said judalan smith she said that dr zeal said that lyle and eric bought the guns in san diego under an assumed name well sure but what name she didn't know that i do ray arguelle does he went down to san diego gun shop the gun shop and the second one he goes into he finds a sail slip for two mossbergs what are mossberg shotguns two of them the friday before the killings in the name of nicholas mariner who happens to have been lyle's best friend from princeton who happens to have been working in a restaurant in new york city that whole weekend who happens to tell arguelle when he calls that he lost his wallet the last time he saw lyle [Music] lester that's incredible yes she's never had a client go to the gas chamber yet does she ever have clients who blew their parents heads off at shotguns you don't know leslie abramson just watch there she is [Music] leslie abramson attorney for eric menendez refusing to comment on the appeals process that's been dragging on for almost a year and a half at stake whether a jury will ever hear the confessions lyle and eric menendez allegedly made to beverly hills psychologist jerome ozil we've got signarelli eric confessed to him we shot mom and dad and he doesn't say anything and and maybe they play chess later that evening it's a hell of a witness i don't know what we've got they're gonna make that kid look awful on the cross what about the shrink oh he won't even talk to us until there's a ruling on the privilege which will be at least six months and then an appeal if it goes against him i don't know i don't know it's just not coming together yeah what is it excuse me they told me i find detective arguello here yeah that's me my name is gerald bronstein lyle menendez hired me to erase some files from his father's computer it's been two years now since lyle and eric menendez were arrested for the shotgun murders of their parents years since lyle and eric menendez it's been over three years since lyle and eric menendez were arrested for the shotgun murders of their parents in the tv room of their beverly hills home three and a half years since the killings defense and prosecution alike await a supreme court ruling expect it any day now on whether or not a supposed confession they made to psychologist el jerome ozil can be introduced at the trial are you surprised the court voiding the doctor-patient privilege apparently threats were made when a patient threatens a doctor there's no privilege did they confess to azeal we haven't studied the doctor's notes we just got the ruling now if you'll excuse us we've been waiting three years to read these notes let me ask you now the court won't let you use the tapes of their session with the doctor is that a victory for the defense i wish we had the tape so the jury could hear what they said in their own voices but we will have dr ozil's testimony and we believe that the doctor will be a very substantial witness i can tell you quite clearly that i intend to attack the credibility of dr ozil in every area known to man and god how do you plan for jack's credibility please this is fantastic they told him it was a perfect murder they wanted to commit the perfect crime they only killed the mother because they couldn't find a way to kill him without killing her this is incredible stuff and we've got his notes he'll testify to what they said it's just as good how the hell are they going to defend this on august 20th 1989 lyle and eric menendez killed their parents they didn't do it for money they didn't do it to commit the perfect crime they didn't do it out of hatred it was done out of fear these boys perceived that their parents were about to kill them they reacted with pure panic pure terror they killed in self-defense this is it this is the big day this is when it all happens by six o'clock this morning there was already a line out in front of the courthouse in van nuys where the trial of lyle and eric menendez begins today two juries have been selected one to hear the evidence against each brother my dad [Applause] now in regards to mr menendez how many individual wounds did you document in your autopsy report six now this first wound that you documented a wound to the back of the head could you tell us about that that is a contact wound uh the muzzle weapon was placed directly in contact with the body in this case the scalp so that the entire load of the shotgun shell pellets wadding entered the head i also recovered pellets along with the wadding referring now to the autopsy you performed on mary louise menendez your report indicates that you identified 10 separate areas of wounding is that correct that's correct now referring to mrs menendez beginning with rule number one this is a shotgun wound to the head particularly the left cheek this is also a contact wound the gun the barrel of the gun was placed directly to the cheek of the deceased and on the afternoon of august 18 1989 do you recall making a sale of two mossberg 12-gauge shotguns yes and did you require identification of the purchaser yes he presented a driver's license the name on the license was mcmahon mr mariner did there come a time when you visited lyle menendez in his home yes and could you tell us how that visit ended i was asked to leave by lyle menendez yeah by lyle yeah and after you left did you notice that you had left something behind yeah i uh that's my wallet did you actually sell rolex watches that day to these defendants yes i did i sold them three the total of the sale came to dollars and forty cents and the person who bought this car do you see him in the courtroom today at the defense table in the blue sweaters indicating the defendant lyle menendez what specifically did lyle menendez say regarding wanting to see this penthouse they just wanted to see the largest unit that was available what was the sale price of that of course 990 000. two pools squash he said that um they ran to the door the tv room and lyle went up and put his shoulder up against the door on the right eric said he looked in saw his parents sitting on the couch and lyle swung open the door and shot his father and looked at eric and said shoot mom isn't it a fact mr cignarelli that when you first told this story to detective arguello you told him that eric did not shoot his mother when he walked into the room that although his brother said shoot mom he couldn't do it that's correct and is that still what you're telling us was eric's statement or has that changed i believe that that still is a statement thank you there's a kind of opening night excitement here today as the state attempts to put the finishing touches on its case if the lines for seats in the crowded courtroom were a bit longer than usual this morning it's because the two juries will finally hear from dr el jerome mozille the beverly hills psychologist to whom the menendez brothers allegedly confessed the defense spent three years in court fighting to keep dr ozil's testimony from being heard today the jury will hear it i recall eric talking at a length about how once the plan was formed that it was impossible to alter the plan and still have it to be perfect as a murder to come off perfectly and even though they had doubts as to whether it in fact was appropriate um whether it was reasonable uh fair uh whatever uh to have the mother included in the murder plan but um still they couldn't determine any other way to kill the father did eric menendez specifically tell you that one of the reasons why he had to kill the mother is that she would be a potential witness oh objection to the leading your honor overruled you may answer that's correct today eric menendez described to you in particular what it was that he was upset with his father about well basically that the father had just been completely dominating controlling impossible to please they saw the father as someone who was pretty much impossible to live with your honor i'd move to strike it's not the defendant's words overruled the answer will stand dr ozil did there come a time when lyle menendez arrived at your office he did and could you please describe his demeanor when he came into your office he was extremely upset threatened threatening menacing menacing so i felt there was a strong threat to my life and did you tell either lyle or eric menendez that you had this fear yes i did and what was the response from lyle he laughed and did either lyle or eric ever tell you he had been sexually abused no and did either of them ever tell you that he acted in self-defense no we'll take a short recess at this time both juries are excused they should return to the courtroom in 20 minutes council please remain i have just a few remarks before we continue the remark has to do with the conduct of counsel during the questioning of the witness specifically that of miss abramson and mugging to the audience during the testimony of the witness if the prosecution would do the same during the testimony of one of your witnesses how would you react to that as long as it wasn't in front of the jury it wouldn't matter to me a counsel the jury is right behind you and to your left the jury can't see what i'm doing i could see your eyes rolling when you're facing the witness the jury can't see that either there is a jury in the jury box that could easily see what you're doing now is there i will try no not try you will succeed in not mugging for the jury not making faces to the audience you will behave professionally is that clear yes of course did you ask your lover miss judalan smith to come to your office on october 31st in order to eavesdrop on your therapy session with eric and lyle menendez that day actually it was quite the contrary well can you answer that question yes or no dr ozil i don't think i can you can't answer that did you ask her to be there no i didn't oh there you go now you knew miss smith quite intimately how would you describe her mental condition would you describe her as a stable person no i wouldn't and she sued you didn't she objection your honor sustained now in fact you told your unstable girlfriend details from your therapy session with eric and lyle menendez isn't that right would you like to ask me why no i would like to ask you what i would like to ask you and that is what i just asked you can you answer it yes i told her and isn't it true that one of the reasons for your testifying the way you did about threats from the defendants was to justify the fact that you told your unstable girlfriend patient secrets and your license as a therapist was already on probation and you were concerned about that miss abramson i'm sure is that what happened you can answer the question sir no that isn't what happened the defense may have scored a few points today raising questions about the credibility of the state's key witness but they still face an uphill fight a fight literally for the lives of lyle and eric menendez who face the gas chamber for the shotgun slayings of their parents a fight that won't be resolved until the defendants take the stand themselves and tell their side of the story spelling your last name joseph lyle menendez mr menendez are you related to eric galen menendez who's seated here he's my brother and we're your parents mary louise menendez and jose menendez yes did you love your mom and dad yes and on august 20th 1989 did you and your brother kill your mother and father yes did you kill them for money what's your answer no did you kill them because you wanted to pay them back for the way they treated you no why did you kill your parents because we are afraid after sports practices he would massage me he would show me he would fondle me and ask me to do the same to him and for how long did this happen not too long began to change it became more involved what do you mean more involved put me in the bathroom it would uh put me on my knees it would guide me all my movements i would have oral sex with him at some point did he do some other things to you he would use objects toothbrush some sort of shaving utensil brush and was there some point when he decided to use something besides the toothbrush yes he raped me did you cry yes did you bleed yes were you scared very [Music] eric was crying he's basically shaking and i asked him what was the matter he was just crying and i told him you know you can tell me what is it he told me things about his dad that were going on things like like that happened to me only they were still going on i felt maybe he was going to try and kill himself and i told my dad that i knew everything that was going on between him and eric and that had to stop and what did he say he said what i do with my son is none of your business and he said i warn you don't throw your life away and he said let me tell you what's going to happen you're going back to princeton and your brother's going to ucla like we planned and we're going to forget this conversation ever took place and when he finished talking what happened i interrupted him he didn't get to finish talking i swore and i told him that he was sick and that no he wasn't going to touch my brother again and that i would tell everybody i would tell everybody everything about him i would tell the police that i would tell the family i was just out of control and he leaned back and he said we all make choices in life son eric made his and you've made yours and he just looked at me and he got up to leave what did you think i thought oh my god i just made it a hundred times worse what did you think was gonna happen i thought we were in danger i thought he had he felt he had no choice but to what that he would kill us and i spoke to my brother and he said oh god they're going to kill us so we agreed we had to protect ourselves we had to go get some guns did you go to get guns we went to the store in santa monica this big five the sporting goods store we went there to buy handguns that we'd carry around but we weren't able to do that because there was a waiting period for handguns you had to wait two weeks and could you tell us what happened then well we drove around talked about it we drove down to san diego we bought shotguns there because there wasn't a waiting period for shotguns and that was a friday and we tried to stay away from them all weekend and sunday night we thought maybe we'd go out you know because we'd be safe if we're out of the house and we went to tell my parents that we're going to a movie and my mom said no that we couldn't go out what did you do well my dad sort of pushed her aside he spoke to my brother and told him to go upstairs to his room and wait for him and i said no you're not going to touch my brother he's just ignoring me telling him to go upstairs and wait for him my mom said something to me about i had ruined the family they went into the den and they closed the doors what did you think was going to happen i thought they were going ahead with their plan to kill us then yes so i ran upstairs and i said to eric it's happening they're going to kill us what did you do i got my gun and what did your brother do he got his and we ran where did you go we were into where he had ammunition which was in my brother's car did you load your gun i did then we ran into the room and to the den and we started firing i don't know who was firing and who or what was going on i was just you know firing my gun and do you remember firing the very close shot at your father yes and at some point was your gun empty yes and i could see somebody moving so i reloaded you reloaded is that yes yes and what did you do after you reloaded ran around and shot my mom and was that the last shot that was fired is that yes yes yes there's no question in anyone's mind that lyle menendez after four days of riveting testimony has completely changed the tone of this trial how he'll withstand cross-examination that's what we'll find out today mr menendez you heard the tape played in this courtroom with your call to the police to 9-1-1 yes i do and on that tape you told the police you had just come home and found your parents is that correct i think i said someone killed my parents you were lying to them weren't you yes and they asked you a number of questions and you were lying to them in your answers weren't you yes and you were crying weren't you you can hear yourself crying on the tape yes you were lying while you were crying is that correct yes did you love your parents mr menendez did you love your mother yes when you placed the shotgun against her left cheek and you pulled the trigger was that an act of love mr menendez confusion fear you were afraid of her at that point yeah where was your mother at this point she was my memory's not that good on this i think i remember she was like around the side of the coffee table and what was she doing in my mind she was sneaking around the coffee table you just said your mother was sneaking is that correct you just use that term sneaking yes and did you think she was going to do something sneaky to you when she was crawling behind that coffee table no your mother wasn't sneaking was she she was trying to get away from being shot to death i don't know i really don't well tell me mr menendez what threat did your mother pose to you when you ran out of the room to reload nothing i can remember my mind specifically and how many rounds did you put into your shotgun just one so what were you afraid of mr menendez were you afraid that your mother might live i don't know i just think he's cute and well i kind of feel sorry for him thank you let's move over here what about you what brings you to the courthouse so early in the morning well eric's going to testify and i just wanted to be here to show my support i mean like i haven't heard him but i've been watching him on tv and i don't know i think he's sexy with the court's permission eric menendez will be sedated when he takes the stand in his own defense his emotional state is apparently quite tenuous and the defense is afraid he won't be able to take the strain of testifying eric menendez and your father would massage you yes like he massaged you when you were swimming similar he would have me strip off my clothes until i was just wearing my underwear and when you were six years old did the massages change in character in any way yes and what was the change he had me take off my underwear he would turn me over on my back and he would massage my genitals was he using his hands yes at some point after that did he start doing something else he wouldn't massage me with his mouth he he came into my room and he told me to kneel down on my bed and and i did and then he came over to my bed and he and he threw me off the bed and told me to kneel on the floor and i was real confused because he just told me to get on my knees on the bed so did you kneel on the floor as he ordered you to do yes okay what happened next he was unbuckling his pants and in some way either by his hand on my head or by telling me he told me what he wanted me to do and was he what was his demeanor what was he like at this time he was rough and he was angry and at one point i started screaming and i started saying stop it hurts it hurts and did he stop no how did you react to this pain i just sort of died off i just sort of left myself i just pretended that it wasn't happening and how old were you when this happened i was 13. now you got your guns you and your brother you loaded your guns why didn't you just wait for your father and mother to come out of the room because i was thinking they were coming out i only thought i had seconds i i thought that they were that as soon as they came out of the room i was going to die so i had to get to that room before they came out and what would have happened if they came out objection speculation never ruled you may answer i thought that they were going to take my gun it was this it was a stupidly big thing and it was just um i i thought they were going to grab it i remember thinking they're going to get it they're going to get this now after you went into the den what do you remember happening i just remember firing did you aim in any particular place just just right in front of me and what was in front of you i was right in front of a coffee table but what was in front of you a coffee table you came into the room you moved to the coffee table am i not understanding what you're saying i was just firing as i came in the room i just started firing in what direction in front of me and what was in front of you my parents i want to take you back to the friday before your parents were killed mr menendez now you testified that you and your brother decided to get guns did you discuss what kind of guns not really just any handguns at some point did you decide where you're going to make this purchase yes that's when we drove to the sporting goods store the big five store in santa monica yes and you took a look at handguns yes when you were looking at these guns was your brother right there with you yes sir you weren't trying to hide anything no so he was right there with you at the counter looking at these handguns yes were they in a glass case or were they up on a wall they were in a glass case it was a two-shelf uh container i believe so and there were the guns on top but at some point you picked out a handgun that you thought was appropriate right yes and that's when he told us that we had to uh i mean that that there was some sort of waiting period now you're telling the truth about everything in this case aren't you i'm telling the truth the best i can and you wanted handguns so you could protect yourself and you went to the big five store in santa monica to buy these handguns definitely without a doubt i did mr menendez did you know that big five stopped carrying handguns in march of 1986 no i don't know that uh mr koriyama there were guns there and we did look at them [Music] does this appear to be the area of the coffee table that's shown in that photograph on the board yes can you see what that is that was next to your mother the letters it's a um registration and a parking registration from ucla and in fact it says ucla they're right on the card yes now you testified that your mother was going to kill you that night correct yes and that's still your belief i'm still my belief to this day yes well if i knew that they didn't have any weapons when i walked in the room i would not have walked in the room but i don't know what my belief is to this day now if your mother had been planning to kill you mr menendez why would she have been filling out your application for ucla it's clear at this point that the defense is based on the mental condition or state of mind of the defendants at the time of the shootings the law is clear that when the defense posits mental condition or state of mind the prior therapeutic history of the defendants is admissible accordingly i am reversing the california supreme court ruling in this case and will allow the jury to hear the tape recording of the defendant's december 11 1989 session with dr l jerome ozil i really think that they're just you know there just wasn't really a family and she was so drained from learning about my father's affair because i i was i was listening in the next room and for months and months i would have to listen to my mother crying in the house and i still think my mom's death was a suicide sort of she had given us permission to to please carry out her suicide my father should be killed there's no question what he's doing is he's impossible to live with it's almost that he he raised us to to be able to handle doing this thing and that we could deal with it because he trained us like basic training there was no way i was going to make a decision to kill my mother without eric's consent i just let him sleep on it for a couple of days my mother and my father were were two people that i loved it doesn't matter what they were what they actually were and i i understand why it was done because that's it you see i i think one of the big biggest pains he has is that you miss having these people around but i had a dog once and i miss not having my dog around if i can make such a gross analogy at the time people of the state of california rested their case in chief this was a murder trial as soon as the defense began it became anything but a murder trial but i am here to tell you today that now you have to concentrate on the murders of jose and mary louise menendez lyle menendez gets on the stand and he gives a stellar performance he cries at the appropriate times it's a great show but keep in mind it is the best defense daddy's money could buy the defendants weren't the only ones who told you what jose menendez was like we had his sisters his brother-in-law his friends people who knew him we had teachers and coaches and i've made a list of words they used to describe him he was belligerent manipulative powerful rude nasty never satisfied how to cut you to shreds tone of voice was aggressive frightening intimidating cruel harshest person ever met he had to win he was overbearing confrontational demeaning abusive sadistic sarcastic controlling fake secretive demanding cold competitive arrogant angry and belittling how many people do you know would fit that description and would you let them raise your child after a lifetime of terror these children were frightened after a lifetime of threats these children felt threatened it may be hard for you to believe that these parents would have killed their children but is it so hard to understand how these children believed that their parents would kill them it is hard sometimes to look at pain and we look away we close our eyes in movies we don't read the newspaper we don't watch the news i ask you now not to turn away from the pain and to see it for what it was and what it did to lyle menendez i ask you to return verdict of guilty of involuntary manslaughter for all the children who have been beaten within an inch of their lives for all the children who have been scalded with hot water as punishment who have been burned with cigarettes who have been locked in rooms for days at a time years at a time and not fed this defense is an offense and for those children who got out of the house and made lives for themselves and became productive members of society this defense is an offense the defendant and his brother viciously and mercilessly attacked their parents on the night of august twentieth nineteen eighty nine the defense has been no less vicious and merciless to them in this trial they have made obscene accusations misleading claims and outright lies about their parents who cannot be here to defend themselves it's very easy to go to a crime scene of a homicide and take a lot of gruesome pictures and parade them in front of a jury but where is the picture of jose menendez bending eric over the footboard of his bed when the child is 12 years old so the father can now go all the way in spite of the child's screams well there is such a picture but unfortunately it only exists in eric's mind now i'd ask you to indulge me and to indulge eric as you're deliberating in this case and to just try to conceive because i can tell that some of you are very resistant to what i'm saying i'm not blind and i'm not stupid but you owe us as jurors one thing only that you must entertain the possibility that we are telling the truth and you must also try however foreign to you it may be to put yourself in eric menendez shoes in order to understand if he did what he did for the reasons we say he did and if we have raised through our evidence a reasonable doubt that malice was present or a reasonable doubt as to whether or not they were acting in the heat of passion or whether or not they were acting in fear then they lose we win and it can be no more than manslaughter eric became my client three and a half years ago there's no way you can go back and share the experiences of a nineteen-year-old which is what he was at the time without getting more than somewhat professionally involved and i admit to that i admit to an enormous bias in favor of this client in those early days i was the only person he had and i've had him in my hands for all this time and now i have to give him up to you there really is good and evil in this world there really is there are really good people and bad people and sadly enough given where we are eric menendez is a good person who did a bad thing and you cannot cannot judge the sinner by the sin alone because you will never know what to call the sin unless you look at the person who did it all right we've got four choices on each count that is each parent the killing of each parent we can find mr eric menendez guilty of first degree murder one or both counts second-degree murder one or two counts voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter one or both counts or not guilty yeah well you forget about that he blew two people away we can't find them not guilty the judge made that very clear i mean they shot them so they have to be guilty of something so let's start with first degree how many think it was first degree what the hell is this first degree murder of course it was first degree murder they shot them after what those people did i would have shot them myself manslaughter how many votes i would say we have a lot to talk about what do we know we know the parents didn't have weapons they weren't trying to kill him lyle thought they were that's what matters he says is there any reason we have to believe him he was on the stand almost two weeks they cross-examined him like i never heard of anything being cross-examined if he was lying able to come out of course he's lying you know that yeah i know that beyond a reasonable doubt no one could listen to all that testimony and not have doubts i don't look at this look what he did to him that's murder that's first-degree murder you take that down we don't have to look at that you're saying lyle wasn't abused how can you say that he confessed to his therapist how come he never mentioned it what would you tell about something like that raped and sodomized and everything else if i told someone i killed two people i damn well tell them why i'm sick and tired of hearing that eric shot them we know he shot them why oh please why that's the question he gives a damn listen to him they all made up their minds before the trials that little bastard got up there and cried you all cried right along with them oh real man don't cry that's sick that is just sick who does that remind you of jose you want premeditation you heard it on that tape and who made that tape oh zeal do you trust that man i don't trust him but he can work a tape recorder listening i'll tell you what i was listening to bam bam bam bam bam how many shots they put in i heard that what it just went over your head or something i certainly went over yours why does it take so many shots to kill two people because he panicked like he said after what that man did to him you don't know what he did i know what my father did i know how it this ain't about your father i know an abused child when i see one eric menendez was abused it has come to this court's attention that in spite of reinstruction to deliberate this jury has come to a deadlock [Music] i give up that's i don't know split the difference look i mean the father abused him we give you that manslaughter for the father murder one for killing the mother [Music] no no we can't do this that's not a verdict it's a lie none of us believe it do you think lyle planned to kill his father he planned it all away but you're gonna vote manslaughter and you you don't think he planned it but you're gonna swear he did you're going to swear he played oh my god one way or another it was our job to end this thing and we didn't do [Music] [Applause] [Music] insoluble it ladies [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
