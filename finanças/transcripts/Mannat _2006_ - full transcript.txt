Just the shadow of the uniform gives us a fright You don't need to be afraid of Captain Nihal Singh I've committed no crime Just that I did not testify for Ujagar Singh regarding a fake encounter It's the truth, I did nothing Then why don't you surrender? - The day the cops get me, it'll be my last I won't let you die. | will save you I know you are being victimised.

Tell me Look, I'd surely want to meet the girl who has stolen my friend's heart You'd rather speak Haryanvi than Punjabi How does it matter? Haryana was a part of Punjab, like siblings Now both are warring for Chandigarh and water Rather have a divide in land than a divide in the heart At your word, I'd even give up my life for you Sat Sri Akal It's you The hymn's so sweet. - Sat Sri Akal Sat Sri Akal All the hymns of the Guru are beautiful, sweet It's humans who are harsh with words Have I said something wrong? - Oh, not you. Actually, I did You? - Yes. The other day when you came over The cops... - I got it I didn't mind that. I know how the cops... Not all cops are alike You came to offer a prayer? For a prayer, yes.

They have humiliated me Who the hell are you? Don't you know this is official inquiry? I have news regarding the inquiry You've been misinformed. Karnail is not here Are you trying to be a sleuth? - I don't intend to sound loud But trust me, even if you kill the mother and daughter... Karnail will not show up Kartar Kaur is a bag of disease Her days are numbered And the girl she is as innocent as God Right? - If I get Karnail... it'll be through them. - Have mercy on them, sir Women are our sisters and daughters. - Yours, not mine!

Anything else you want? I'm not a beggar Get this clear, women For this good man's sake, | spare you Else, I'd have left only after completing the inquiry They call me Ujagar Singh Terror C'mon, guys You can't repay my favour. What if the cops had taken your daughter away? One can never trust tyrants and cops That's what I'm trying to explain. Fix the girl's fate Trust me... get her married Married to whom? She was engaged once But they refused after finding out that her brother was a terrorist Where do I go begging? - How stupid If you heed me, the cops won't even look at you He is quite influential And no question of breaking off the alliance Alliance with whom? My friend. Narang Singh He's a big shot Marry her off to him, that's it May your tongue burn! He is of my husband's age? Aren't you ashamed to bring the proposal? Men and studs never age Trust me, the cops will disappear Uncle, why talk to her? Talk to me See? The girl is smarter than her mother If you say, I'll speak to Narang Singh about you Uncle, your friend Narang Singh is anice chap, isn't he? He's an angel Isn't herich? Business worth millions Must be moving around in hi-fi circles? With the likes of ministers Then, there's nothing to worry about You are raving, Parseen. -Don't you interfere. The kid is smart Nothing to worry about. If you marry into that family... you will rule! - Get lost Uncle, why don't you marry off your daughter to Narang Singh? Don't ponder much, uncle. Mustn't let go of a golden opportunity You are a devil, Sadhu Singh Get the hell out of here! Else, you'll see the worst of me Well uncle, don't want to go home? May you die a dog's death. Narang's pimp! She humiliated me no end, officer She told me to get my daughter married to Narang That's very bad You are raving. For your sake, | took abuses Bloody, for your sake, we turned demons True You mean he is a demon? No, no Not that you are really demons What I mean to say is, you guys are doing so much for me It's love after all I, Inspector Ujagar Singh Terror, disgraced myself for your sake And I being the chief of the village, if I move around people like him... I'll lose face. - My Lord, please tie my destiny with Parseen Kaur's Ass! Idiot A girl as beautiful and disciplined as her is not a matter of sheer luck Then how? - It takes an itch on your left palm Here... I get the itch. It's love after all Moron! Itching means spending. You got dough? Here you are | can spend more, but Parseen Kaur must belong to me Are you drinking tea? Or buttermilk? - What's wrong? Anything else, sir? Get the young lady in a platter Shut up. - What, sir? Fritters on a plate. - Right, sir My girl number 7, Vimla, would watch me from the corner of her eye She'd look very "aandi" Aandi means?

Not in my life... have I seen a girl like her You see... let her be my 52nd girlfriend, you find another one for yourself I'll hit you! - Why did you call me here then? Just to stare at her? -What do I do then? Send the young lady here. - Right, sir Let her come. - What are you up to? Talk to her You sent for me? Hello, lady Sat Sri Akal Now what? Ma'am... Nihal Singh said, your village is fantastic. It's really fantastic, I must say Have you seen around? Not really, but every thing here is very beautiful Aandi? - Beautiful At least the ass spoke! Nihal said...! Why don't you say it yourself? Would you like something else? Tea? - No... thank you You are hopeless. I took a risk for your sake... on duty that is. Why didn't you say something? Should I have raved? - Tell you something... this girl, the epitome of beauty, will one day surely trap you And that comes from the bottom of this Haryanvi's heart Are you shy, pal? Eat Sat Sri Akal, sir Sat Sri Akal, young man. Come, sit You are blessed, you are close to God You are right, but life's a grind anyway Grind? Why? Every other day there's an incident And the cops go knocking every door It hurts But this village seems to be decent... just one man absconding, but he too, people say, is innocent You know everything then The day that boy vanished, the cops hauled his father in Later, his body was found in the canal No knowing if the cops killed him or he killed himself out of grief Do you know them? - Of course People don't swear falsely by their name. Very decent folks Where are you from? - Consider this to be my home Implying? - As a kid, I lost my parents An army officer educated me Before I could join the army, become a captain, he passed away God Almighty Tell me something, sir. Those who have nobody...? What are you saying, son? Those who have nobody, have God Then God Himself will find a match for me Of course, He will. But man is the medium Who is there for me? -I am Tell me. I'll perform the duty Do you have someone in mind? Else, shall I look for someone? Talk to Kartar Kaur, about her daughter. Only if she agrees | shall talk to her, but don't change your mind, don't embarrass me God is witness, sir. I've made up my mind Just that it should not be per force Blessed be the Lord, blessed be His mercy Sir, you called me? Yes, I did Tell me something. - Sir? Are you here to romance? - No, sir? If the entire unit gets down to romance, who will perform the duties? Answer me Speak up. Why don't you talk?

Yes, sir | know that, aunt He loves us more than he'd love his sons But we don't understand something. Sometimes he's so fierce... like an atom-bomb This poor guy thought he'd get married and settle down But he was admonished, badly at that. Now he's hopeless Aunt, can I ask you something very personal? Go on, you have the liberty I'm amazed. What kind of man are you putting up with? Son, he is my husband Let him return, I'll show him my indifference I'll give in only when he gives his nod for Nihal Aunt, you are my only support We'll leave now, aunt I'd like to ask something, aunt. -Goon How could you spend your life with a hot-tempered, boring, hopeless person? | see So I am hot-tempered? Hopeless? Boring? Sorry, sir Out you go! Out Idiots Well So I am hot-tempered, hopeless, boring? The boys are right. - Well? Really? I'll have Nihal Singh arrested... and sentenced for life. - For life? | can't believe my destiny could ever show me happiness We love him more than we love our son | take him to task at will. He is very decent It's the Lord's will He is Omnipotent. He blesses His loved ones He alone decides whom to give and when to give The boy is willing but we must know the girl's opinion Well Parseen? | have raised my daughter very affectionately I know her likes and dislikes What do we do, dear?

Look... she is into whoring at her inn How dare she raises her voice before a village chief? She has all the vices, she's even getting her daughter into it Very bad, very bad Mr Singh, I said not a word, yet she started swearing at me It's logical for the chief to lose his temper. Love's labour lost Go away now. Put your word up in the morning Jasvinder, take them away. - We won't let injustice happen here Uncle, don't you understand what's told to you? Get out of the house. - Why? We are not wrong.

It's a baby girl But the mother... - Hasn't Parseen come around? My sympathies are with you. I'm sorry | tried my best but I couldn't save the mother Sir, the wireless is not connecting. - Keep trying It's been five days This storm doesn't appear to abate It's still snowing in Siachen. The storm hasn't subsided Nihal can take a copter only when the weather is clear | saw the baby today. Very sweet So tender! Like a ball of cotton But her destiny...? No knowing what it holds Mysterious are His ways He sent her into the world and took her mother away Who knows what God wills? Why are you gloomy?

She's his daughter. The last memento of his wife He will get a hold on himself, carry on with life Man is a flying horse. Nihal will marry again But the baby will suffer. - Why? Why do you think like that? Not all men are alike. Not women either If you don't mind, may I say something?

We'll... let's tell Nihal to give the baby to us He'll have no worries and I'll have a baby You are raving! He hasn't even picked up his wife's body from the morgue yet How could you become so selfish? - Not selfish I'm just being a woman. The mother within me has awakened me... just for the sake of this innocent baby Look, you mustn't build castles in air God did not give us a baby, it doesn't mean that... This could also be His will. You never know It's the Lord's way to fill my lap with the crackling laughter of a baby You and your God Not connecting, sir. Looks like we've lost coverage from the last post I'm a woman, no wonder | want to become a mother But you are stone-hearted! Insensitive, heartless, callous What'd men know about the joys of motherhood? My dear, listen... - Nothing You can't fathom my feelings | feel like a mother. Try evoking the feelings of a father But you... damn No good. You don't have the feelings of a father No wonder God didn't give us a baby My dear, why are you tormenting yourself?

It's a crime to steal someone's baby! Will your father bear the punishment? It's not a crime. Besides, I will bear the punishment Try to understand. It's God's will The mother inside me awakens the moment I see her How can I leave this tender being to the grind? My heart doesn't acquiesce. - To hell with your heart! Do what I say!
