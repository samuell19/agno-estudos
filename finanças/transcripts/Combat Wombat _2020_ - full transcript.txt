Yeah. Michael. What did I say about flying out-of-bounds during recess? Let's keep it below ten feet, mister. Sorry, miss. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... I see you, Daniel Furbank. Eyes closed. I wasn't peeking. Yes, you were. Start again, please. Ten, nine... You better get moving, Mr. Burrows. Hide somewhere else. Nope, not here. Spot's taken, new kid. Ten, nine, eight, seven... ...six, five, four, three, two, one. Ready or not, here I come. Morning, team. I hope everyone is rested and ready to dig. Today, we are starting construction on a very important project. Teddy, the blueprints, please. Right, let's see... Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. These seem to be in order. Time to check our safety signs. Mmm-hmm, everything seems to be up to code. Wait. We're missing the most important sign. "No boys allowed." Perfect. Huh? What are you doing in here? I'm hiding. You can't hide in here. Didn't you read the sign? Uh, what sign? This is a supersecret fort. But it's not super-secret if you know about it. I, uh... I'm sorry, I just moved here. It's my first day. So, are you staying here for long? Well, my parents really like Sanctuary City. So, hopefully for a while. I mean in my fort. Oh. Right. That's okay. I can find somewhere else to hide. Well, I guess it is a waste of a good hiding spot. We've decided you can stay. Besides, we could always use another worker on the team. Maggie Diggins. I kinda run things around here. Bradley Burrows. Can I go on lunch now, boss? Mmm, sure. What's that? Uh, it's a Bush Bar. Would you like some? - Ew. - Come on. You'll love it. We can share. Okay. Um... Maybe we can share one bar. All right. All done here. So... What should we hang here next? Hmm... A photo of us eating Bush Bars? Good idea. Keeps things fresh. I'm just happy that we finally have our own super-secret fort. Speaking of, I better get to work if we wanna keep this fort over our heads. My boss is very strict when it comes to tardiness. I'm sure she'll give you a pass. I'll race you to the job site? Loser has to cook dinner. We didn't say go yet! Hope you like deep-fried Bush Bars! Hurry up! Bring in Cuddly Cub. So, what are you cooking for dinner tonight? Watch out! Is it me, or do those guys seem to be... Terrible at their job? I was gonna say "inexperienced", but, yes, that'll work too. Bradley, did you feel that? I felt it. Maggie, sweetheart, we need to leave. This way. Quickly. Bradley, no! We're... Bradley, we're trapped! There's no way out! What are we gonna do Bradley? We just have to think with our claws. Trust me. Uh. Ah! I have a plan! Mags, through here! Go! I'm right behind you! Bradley, I'm stuck! I can't get through. Hang on! No, no. Bradley? Bradley. Bradley, where are you? No, Bradley. Over here! I've got another one! No, let go of me! Miss, I... I need you to relax while I save you. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no. Bradley? Bradley! No! We've got a hyperventilating wombat here. We need oxygen! Let go of me! I don't need oxygen! I need to... I need to find my husb... Don't worry, ma'am, you're safe now. You've got the Flightless Feather to thank for that. Where are we with that oxygen? I don't need ox... It's okay, madam. You're safe now. Are you sick of being bullied with the taunt, "chicken legs, chicken legs, check out his chicken legs"? Well, down some Cass Mass Protein Powder and you'll have the calves of a Cassowary King. Cass Mass Protein Powder. Breaking news this morning. Flightless Feather saves the day once again. Huh? Brad? Bradley? Bradley? Huh? Ah. Pizza! I can't believe you, Maggie. Unlawful entry. Property damage. Digging without a safety permit. What's this? Theft? I may have eaten a slice of their pizza. What's it gonna take for you to stop searching? Finding him. Maggie! I know this is incredibly difficult for you to accept, but... Look, I just... I don't know what else can be done. I wanna read the case file. This again. I dug those tunnels, and I don't make mistakes. There's gotta be something in there. You have photographs, witness statements. It was an accident, Maggie! Regardless, those files are for law enforcement only. And the Flightless Feather? Uh... He's a superhero, Maggie! He enforces the law. If he was such a hero, Bradley would still be here. And I wouldn't be getting a lecture from you! This isn't a lecture! It's a friendly chat. Huh? Friendly chats don't involve handcuffs. Ha! You know very well those handcuffs are so you don't eat my din... Huh? You were right to use the handcuffs. When are you gonna find another job, hmm? There's plenty out there. I don't need to find another job. I need to find Bradley. It's been six months, Maggie! What are you really hoping to find? My life. Good evening. I'm Regina Rogers. Tonight's top story, the Flightless Feather has once again foiled another brazen robbery attempt, this time at Marsoupial Kitchen in the city's south. It's the fifth incident this month by the group being dubbed the Bushy Tail Bandits. We've identified their calling card, which is a hair ball. Mmm, gross. We spoke with local possum earlier today, who was present during the attempted robbery. Well, uh, I was getting the soup of the day bro and these robbers burst into the kitchen. But they... But they didn't realize that this soup, a hero, was on the menu. Mmm-hmm. Another verbal treat for our viewers at home. Well, you know what else is a treat, Reggie? Zoom Plume, for keeping my feathers smooth and aerodynamic. I'm so sick of your stupid face. Well, this won't get me through the night. Oh, no! We are being robbed! Somebody help us! - Cassowary Kick. - Oh, my sugar drops. Oh, my sugar drops! It's Flightless Feather! He came to save us! It's your arch nemesis... Monsieur Peabody! Monsieur Flightless, it's time for you to rest in "peas." How will Flightless Feather get out of this one? Bingo, bango, that's my mango. Oh, well, fear not. Here comes his trusty sidekick, the Gallant Glider, to offer support from the sky. Whoosh! Super speed engaged. Dun-na-na-na! End of the line, bandit scum! Ow! Hello! Please no small talk, please no small talk, please no small talk. Welcome to Owlways Open, where our prices are hooting mad. Hoot may I help you? Oh. Well, we have lots of hoot, hoot, hooting deals going on at Owlways Open. We've got two-for-one Flightless Featherade, hooty percentage off Flightless Candy Bars. Hoot. Can I at least interest you in some new Flightless Chili? Oh! All righty, just a moment. Drop bears! No! Aren't you three just the cutest? How can I help you? Aw, you're thirsty. Oh, look, they're thirsty. Isn't that cute? You know, people used to call me cute. That was before I got my glasses. They say carrots are really good for your eyesight. I can't eat carrots because they hurt my teeth. Well, that wasn't so cu... That definitely isn't cute! Do you need a hand with... I'll be with you in just a moment. Okay, uh... Ow, ow! Hey, hey, little drop bear? Get down from there! No, no, no. You're not allowed to do that. No, no, please don't eat the chips! No! No, no! Not my hat! You've crossed the line! Please, please give me my hat back! I love that hat! Aha! Gotcha! See? Everything is under control! Wait, what? Stop wriggling! Well, that's an unfortunate turn of events. I was just saying that Mr. Owlett wouldn't be very happy giving away his food for free? Let me call head office and I'll... No, no, no! Please don't eat me. Please don't eat me! Please don't eat me! Let go of the Bush Bars! And the kid too, I guess. You should probably put him down too. Huh? Ooh, Eucalyptus! Oi, buddy! How ya doin'? Uh-oh. That was awesome! I am so fired. Oh, my sugar drops! You were so, so cool! You were like, whoosh, whoosh. Oh, and then, he tried to slice you, shoo, shoo. Yeah, yeah, I remember. But you were just like, "I don't think so. My butt, your face." Pwah! Yes, I'm aware. I was there too. I'm Sweetie, by the way. Sweetie? That's what my parents call me. You know like, "Good night, Sweetie." My friends call me Sweetie as well. Oh, well, that is if I had friends. So... What's your name? Uh... Babushka! Babushka the Wombat. No! Shh! No, no, no. I meant your alias, Babushka. A superhero should never reveal their true name. Yeah, I'm not a superhero, kid. But you saved the day, Babushka. Yeah, really regretting that name choice now. But that's what superheroes do. See? Step 16 to being a superhero: Save the day! That's what you did! Okay, so I intervened, but that doesn't make me a superh... But having a superhero name is the most important step. You can't be a superhero without a name. Not a superhero. Don't need a name. Ooh, ooh, ooh! How about Butt Woman? Oh. No. Or Super-Incredibly-Strong-Butt Wombat! No, no, that's too long. Oh! But Flightless says you need a name that should match your powers, so we need something for those awesome butt moves. I've got it! I've got it. I've got it! This is it. This is it. Da-na-na-na! Combat Wombat! Well, this is me right here. Nice meeting you. Bye. Is this really your house? Yes. Babushka... My name isn't even Babushka! It's Maggie! Ooh! A secret identity. Anyway, I realized that you don't have a sidekick. And I'd make a great one. Ready for the name? Ready for the name? The Gallant Glider! Say what? We should hit the streets later. Me soaring through the sky, keeping an eye on you from above. What do you say? I'm not going out looking for trouble. And neither should you. You're too young for that. Too young? In case you haven't noticed, I have a mustache! Flightless says anyone can be a hero. See? Chapter fiftee... Well, I'm closing this chapter. And by that I mean, our brief... whatever this has been. Oh. See ya round. Or, you know... hopefully not. But... But wait! Wait! You are a superhero! You just don't know it yet. And you will meet your archenemy one day! Sooner than you think. Gerald? What have I told you about looking at the neighbors sinisterly? Get inside! Sorry, Mum! Oh. "Anyone can be a hero." I wish you were right. Stop, thief! Watch out! Here's Ibis! Masks! Bushy tails! Bandit-like behavior! The Bushy Tail Bandits! Oh, Flightless, what should I do? "In case of a chase sequence" do nothing? "Wait for the hero to arrive"? What? Flightless Feather, coming through! Oh, my gumdrops! It's flightless! Hey, it's me, it's me! It's your number one fan! And your trusty sidekick, the Gallant... All right, yeah, you... go take the lead. You take the lead. Oh, no, no, no, no, no! This can't be happening! Flightless, he's getting away! Come on, Sweetie, it's your time to shine. Anyone can be a hero. - Hey, hey, you! You! - What? Stop in the name of Flightless! Hmm. Come back! Parkour! Wow. Impressive. Don't look down. Don't look down. I looked down! You can do this, Sweetie. You can do this. Don't look, don't look. Ha-ha! End of the line, bandit scum. If only you could fly. Ha-ha-ha. - Oh. - See ya, sucker! No! Come on, Sweetie. You can still catch him! Careful, careful. Okay, okay. Easy now. You can do this, Sweetie, you can do this! All you've got to do is glide. Or I could just walk. I'll just walk. Walking's just as fast as flying. Can't skip leg day. Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, don't close! Don't close! It's okay, Sweetie. Everything is gonna be okay. Just hold on tight and don't look down. Don't... Why do I always look down? Somebody do something! We need a hero! I will save him! Duh-duh-da-da! Mmm-hmm. Yeah! When I sip on gumnut coffee, it gives me my daily Cassowary Kick! Things are tense here, folks. It appears the young sugar glider is unwilling or unable to glide to safety. He better fly soon or he will become... ...a "sugar faller" instead. Oh! I knew it! I knew he would get himself into trouble. Well, what would you do in this situation? You would... let the authorities deal with it and not get in their way. Why do you have to be such a good guy? Well, it looks like it's gonna rain anyway, so I can't go out. Who even took these photos? Oh, fine, fine, I'm going, I'm going! Mmm-hmm. I can't go out looking like this. Unless... nobody knows it's me. Need bigger hands! Just let go and glide! You'll be okay! Hmm! Did she just crawl out of bed? Is that a onesie? And we're back, live in downtown Sanctuary City where an unidentified wombat is attempting to save the young sugar glider. Oh, no! The plug! Woo-hoo! Sweetie, get off me! Oh, yeah. What does it feel like to be a hero? Can we get a name? Go on. Tell them. Combat. Combat Wombat. Combat, is there anything you want to say to the animals of Sanctuary City? Yeah. I'm going back to bed. He can do anything, darling. He's a chameleon. No, darling, he's a cassowary, but he can promote anything. Who cares if your product is for fish. We'll slap some gills on him and you won't know the difference. Okay. Bye-bye. I don't understand, CeCe. I'm not seeing my name in this article anywhere. Oh, you may have to turn the page, darling. Turn the page? What do you m... Page two? I didn't even know newspaper's had a second page. Ugh! I stopped five robberies. All she did was dig a little hole. I do that all the time. I dig, like, seven holes a day to poop! You poop seven times a day? Well, I... I'm a page two superhero who's been under a lot of stress lately. Relax, my dear. It's one measly little article. It'll be old news by tomorrow. Nobody will even notice. Good morning! Are you all right? How'd you get in here? Well, first, I created an alias and convinced your neighbors I was your new roomie. Beep-boop. Then, I had to... I left the door unlocked didn't I? - Yep. - Damn it. Actually, it wasn't even closed. It was wide open. Well, that doesn't mean you can just stroll on in! Oh, sorry. Wow! Oh! Oh, I knew it! I knew it! Oh! You are a superhero! Oh! This is a map of all the crimes you've solved. Flightless has one just like it. No! Just... It's nothing. You can see the whole city from here. Ooh, ooh, this is where I live. - Stop touching that! - And that's where I work. Ooh, and this is where I take air saxophone lessons. What? I knew it! I knew it, I knew it, I knew it! And it's your archenemy. Dun-dun-da! That's not my archenemy! Um, then why is he dressed like that? It was Halloween! Hallo-what? What do you want, Sweetie? Oh, yes, yes! I brought you the paper. Look. You made front page! Why are you so grumpy today anyway? Oh, I'm a little tired from saving somebody! Well, that's the life we live as superheroes. Oh, do we? So tell me, Gallant Glider, any reason why you couldn't glide yourself to safety last night? I... I needed to save my energy. Obsessed with superheroes soaring through the sky and you can't even fly. I can so fly! Maybe in your little make-believe world, Gallant Glider. It's not make-believe! Seriously, how come you never learned how to glide, huh? Because! You're a sugar glider. Because I never had anyone to teach me. I was going to learn but... Come on, Sweetie. Oh, we love you, Sweetie. But I... I never got to fill out the rest of the pages with them. Oh. All I wanted was to put one story in my book. Bradley. My archenemy in the picture. He's actually my husband. - Oh. - Tunneling accident. He went missing and I can't find him. I lost my job and the love of my life on the same day. So, I, uh... I know you said no more drop-ins, but I thought I'd drop-in and say thanks... for last night. Sanctuary City needs heroes like you. Thanks. But they've already got a hero. They don't need another. Well, maybe it's what you need. What do you mean? Maybe it's what you need to get back out and live your life. I live my life! Okay. Maybe you have a point. Well, it's better than sitting at home all day. Besides, you said you lost your old job, so maybe being a superhero could be your new job? Superhero? Those files are for law enforcement only. I'd be law enforcement. You could be just like Flightless! Ahh! Saving citizens. Stopping the bad guys. Or accessing files. Your file. Uh... Huh? Nothing. Tonight will go down in history. Defender of Sanctuary City, Combat Wombat! Except, you're a little rough around the edges. What you need is a sidekick. Yeah, you weren't gonna let that opportunity fly past, were you? A sidekick who can teach you how to be a true superhero. Yes! Oh! Oh! Side kick! - What was that? - A side kick. You know, cause I'm your side... I'm already regretting this. All we need to do is carefully follow every step in Flightless's How to Hero book, and you will be a superhero in no time. It's simple science. Step one: create your costume. Ta-da! Ugh! Step Two: perfect the pose. If we're gonna be heroes, we need to pose like heroes. Step three: get in superhero shape! Mmm. Step four: find your superpower! Cassowary Kick! Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Butt Power! Step five: find your civilian love interest. Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. I already have a love interest! His name is Bradley. So now that you've mastered basics, it's time to move on to something a little more interesting. Come on. Harder. Faster. Butt smash! Butt stomp! Butt power! Wow! Woo-hoo! Combat Wombat! Well, I thought this would be more exciting. And we haven't even done anything super yet. Furbanks will never call us superheroes. Well, all we need is a citizen in need. I'm a citizen in need! Well, that's extremely convenient. And three, two, one. Oh, I'm helping! I'm helping! You did it, Combat! Combat! Woo-hoo! Yeah! ♪ Combat Wombat, yeah ♪ ♪ Here to save the day ♪ ♪ Combat Wombat here ♪ ♪ With her Best friend Sweetie ♪ Is that my... Uh-huh. It's just... so big. It's meant to be. - It's your butt! - Hmm. Superhero montage! Air saxophone solo! Butt power! Sweetie? Look out, Sanctuary City. Combat Wombat has resurfaced, and she's not afraid to get her paws dirty. Yippee! Bradley? Oh, my sugar drops! Look, Combat! She dressed up as you! Why, hello there, young crime fighter. How are you today? You've inspired me to give up my dreams of becoming a doctor to become a superhero! - Aw! - My dad dressed up too. Aw. Very nice. We should talk, darling. Wow! Oh, wow! Sweetie, why are we even here? Well, because even Combat Wombat needs powerful allies. Can you believe this? - Look at all this. It's so... - Pretentious? Yes! Preten... nentionous. Oh, my Flightless! Oh, my Flightless! Oh, what now? It's the Sanctuary City Peace Idol! The symbol of unity in our city. This was awarded to CeCe and Flightless as a symbol of eternal gratitude. Only the greatest superheroes get one of these. You, my dear, are no superhero. You're a superstar! And what should all superstars have? A mansion made out of strawberry ice cream? Um, before that, darling. Um... A sponsorship deal! Oh. CeCe, what's this all about? It's about you taking this opportunity and squeezing it for all it's worth! Starting with... Bush Bars! Wow. Where'd they get the pic of you smiling? Bush Bars will be the first building block of your empire. I want your face to be everywhere in Sanctuary City. I'm talking advertising, sponsorships, merchandise, the works! And with the Flightless Feather as your sidekick. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Sidekick? She's already got a sidekick... The Gallant Glider. That name means nothing to me. Who is that? Me! Well, I guess that could work too. Look, the point is, Flightless is out, darling. You're the next big thing! However, I will need you to... how to say this... cut back on the hero side of the job in order to attend photo shoots, product promotions, that sort of thing. So, what do you say, darling? You know what else is a treat? Featherade's new savior flavor. When I sip on gumnut coffee, it gives me my daily Cassowary Kick! To be honest, CeCe, I'm not really interested in the whole business of being a superhero. I appreciate the offer, but I have another reason for wanting to do good. Do you know what this sponsorship even means, darling? Free Bush Bars for life! What? For life? Any flavor you want, it's yours. And for your sidekick, Mr. Gallant Glider, well, who knows? We might even have a costume for him. A costume? Oh! I'm afraid my answer is still no. I wanna do this for the right reasons. How could I be angry when you're so honest with me? And to be honest myself, I actually wish Flightless was more like you. Oh, the ego on that cassowary. You're a real superhero, Combat. Don't ever change. Breaking news this morning. Are the Bushy Tail Bandits back in action? It has to be them! The Pawlice found the group's calling card at each of the locations. So Flightless wasn't around to stop any of the robberies. As much as I hate the guy, he'd done a good job of stopping them so far. Uh... Oh, oh, oh! Oh, my God. Oh. Ooh! - It's for you. - Ugh! What's it say? "Welcome to the world of crime fighting, Combat Wombat and friend." It says friend! - Keep reading. - Ahh. If you've been watching the news, you'll know we've been quite busy of late. Since you're new to the game, we thought we'd give you a fighting chance. Let's see if you really are koala-fied for the job. Koala. Oh. Our next target is the Koalaty PR Agency. We're looking to book in a powwow with your little friend, CeCe. Regards, your new sworn enemies, the Bushy Tail Bandits! This is our moment, Sweetie! If we can take down the Bushy Tail Bandits, Furbank will have to officially make us superheroes. Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Now from the note, it looks like the bandits are planning to steal the Sanctuary City Peace Idol from CeCe's office. Remember the time they said "Combat Wombat and friend" in the note? Good times. Ready? Ready! Ready! Frogman? What are you doing here? Shoo, shoo, go on, get outta here! We're gonna burrow inside for a surprise attack, give them no chance to escape this time. Wait. Wait. We are going to burrow? Our office hours are 9:00 till 5:00, Monday through Friday. Please call back... Ow! My bum! Shh! Maggie. Hey, Maggie. - Psst! Maggie. Maggie. - What? Let's go back-to-back. It'll look so cool! Back to... What? Why? All superheroes do it. Wha... We are not doing... Back-to-back. Here he comes. The Gallant Glider. You like sugar drops? How about a Glider-rang? Zoom! The Peace Idol. - A Bush Bar? - Huh? What's going on Combat? Sweetie? I think we've been set up. But why? Who would do that? Flightless! Hey! What are you doing in here? Um, I, uh... left my glasses here somewhere. Oh, no! Can't see without my glasses. Hmm, but... you were just wearing glasses. They were on your face! Hey! Where's the Peace Idol? Oh, no, no, no, no, no! This is all a big mistake. No need to panic. Sweetie! We've gotta go! Shots fired! Send me backup! I can't find my glasses, Maggie! - Come on, Sweetie! - Oh, found them! Found my glasses. Let me just adjust them and... Uh, Maggie, the exit is on the other side. Just trust me! Yippee! Oh, Gallant Glider, teach me how to fly! Combat Wombat, did you just rob that building? What do you have to say for yourself? Uh, Combat. We might have a little, tiny bit of a big problem. Yeah, you think? How could I have been so stupid? How did I fall for that? I knew Flightless Feather was hiding something. It was always him. Little one, can you tell me your thoughts on your "hero," Combat Wombat? Combat Wombat taught me that if you believe in yourself, you can do anything. I guess that anything includes robbing people. You let me down, Combat! Flightless, have you got anything to say to Combat Wombat? Yeah. You just robbed your life of freedom, punk. There you have it, folks. Combat Wombat isn't a superhero. She's a thief. I'm Regina Rogers, Sanctuary City News. You want me to be a thief? I'll be a thief. How you... How you holdin' up? Sweetie! What... What are you doing here? I was worried about you. They're saying some terrible things about you on TV. - Wait, what's that? - Nothing! It's none of your business. Another break-in has taken place this morning, this time in the most unlikely of places: The Sanctuary City Pawlice Station. Huh? That's... You... You stole that? Why? So I can find my husband. That's... That's not something a superhero would do. - That's not something you would do. - Grow up, Sweetie! This is the only reason I became a superhero to begin with. So I could get the information in this file. So you never even cared about any of this? Why would I? Look where it's got me. Or should I say, look where you've got me. What does that mean? None of this would have happened if you didn't get me involved in all of this superhero mess to begin with! You think this is my fault? Well, you tell me. I was doing just fine when I was by myself. The way it should be. You know, you may not want other animals in your life, but... some animals... they need you in theirs. I really wish you were here right now. Do you really have to make such a mess all the time? You mean of the living room or just my life in general? Both. He's a good kid. I know. You're gonna have to do that thing you hate doing more than cleaning now. Apologize? Mm-hmm. But don't beat yourself up about the floor. Sometimes you need to make a mess of things before you can make sense of things. What does that mean? What? Mm-hmm. We have a witness at Sanctuary Plaza, where it seems the town's beloved superhero, Combat Wombat, has not been so super. Excuse me, sir. Sir, can you tell me what you saw? Well, we all came out when we heard the alarm, and that's when Combat literally flew out of the building. She thought she'd gotten away with it, but she... - Huh? - Hey, do I get paid for this interview? Huh. It's the same guy every time! Bingo! Sweetie? Uh, do you need a hand? Don't worry about it! I know "helping others" isn't really your thing now. Sweetie... I'm sorry for what I said earlier. I was way out of line. You said that I don't want other animals in my life, but I do. I just... I can't afford to lose anyone else that I love. Hopefully we can... save the day one more time together. Every superhero needs a costume. I didn't have much material left, so it's, you know... Thank you. And you were right, we should save the day! And I know just how to do it. But I need my side-kick! No way! You did a side-kick! Come on, Gallant Glider. Let's go get this guy! Please, no! If you have any sense of compassion... If you have any sense of mercy, you'll let us go. I am a loving brother, a son, an uncle. No, wait. Wait. That's not right. That doesn't hold enough gravitas. I have a family! And I cannot bear the thought of never seeing little... What's a cute name... something lispy. Uh, Erica, Lily, Lilith. Lilith! That's perfect. I cannot bear the thought of never seeing little Lilith's face ever again. And scene. I'm the Gallant Glider. Boo! Why are you doing this to me? You set me up. What are you talking about? I didn't set up nobody. I got a note saying CeCe's office was being robbed! You were behind it. I promise! I never set up nobody! I'm just an actor! What? What did you just say? I don't know nothin' about no setup. Now would you please, please just remove your butt from my very delicate spine? Hmm. My name is Perry Poslowski. I'm part of a group of actors hired to make Flightless look like a real superhero. Uh, we all play different roles in his heroic acts. So it's all just... make-believe? Wait, he's not really a superhero? Nah, it's all fake, lady. But it's great dramatic training for us actors. Oh, Flightless, please help me! I was just robbed! Much like I was robbed of my youth as a young possum, growing up in a broken family in urban Sanctuary City. Wow. Yeah. That is just really, really good acting, but we're a bit pressed for time here. Backstory is important. So, what about the criminals? Yeah, the Bushy Tail Bandits. You mean the Bushy Tail Criminal Group? They're all actors. Very talented thespians, if I do say so myself. I'm doing a show with these fellas this week at the Sanctuary City Community Theatre. You guys should come along. Regina Rogers reporting to you live from the Bird Borough. Now, we thought we'd seen the last of the Bushy Tail Bandits, but they've resurfaced in a daring daylight robbery of The Bank of Shiny Things... That sound you're hearing is the crowd cheering the arrival of Flightless, who will hopefully bring this event to a speedy conclusion. Hey, wait! You wanna take a few flyers, pass 'em out to ya friends for the show this week? We need the numbers. All right, beaks on the floor! Don't play anything smart on me! I'm very smart! I'm smarter than all of you! Beaks on the floor! Nests out! No, I don't think so. Beaks off the floor, I say. Oh, you're going down, Flightless! That's right. I am going down. Downtown with you in handcuffs. Let's fight! Cassowary Kick! I have been defeated! He killed the panda! You... Me? You! No, you. I'm taking you in! No, no, no, no, no, I'm taking them in, and then I'm taking you in. Let's fight! Cassowary Kick! Not so convincing when you have to fight a real hero, huh? Oh, you're not a real hero! You're a criminal! You're a criminal! - You set me up! - I set you up? I never set you up. Hey, mate. Was there an update to the script? I don't know! I am completely lost! Oh, sure, just like you never set up all of the crime you've thwarted. What are you talking about? I never set up anything. Now for the love of Flightless, if you don't let me go, the Bushy Tail Bandits are gonna get away. Nobody is getting away because none of this is real! What? What are you talking about? What? Can't you see? They're not real criminals. They're just actors. What do you mean? It's all fake, Flightless. No, that can't be. So, this is all just make-believe? You really didn't know? Wait a minute... Flightless, if you didn't know about any of this, then that means... You just couldn't leave well enough alone, could you, darling? Wow. It's really dark over in that corner. Out! All of you! CeCe, why did you set me up? You were constantly taking the spotlight away from Flightless, ruining my business in the process! Do you know how many sponsors dropped out after you came on the scene? You know, it didn't have to be this way, Combat. We could have made a lot of money together. But, no, you just wanted to be a hero for the right reasons. Uh, so did I. Ugh, you got what you wanted. I fake a few crimes, you get to stroke your ego, and sponsorship deals keeping rolling in. I may be vain, but I actually thought that I was doing some good in the world. But you were, darling. You're a celebrity! You gave everyday nobodies something to look up to. Now, you're going to do your job like the good little superhero boy that you are and convince everyone that you've saved the day once again. Mr. Flightless. Mr. Flightless. I was a nobody once. But you made me feel like a somebody. You want a hero, CeCe? You've got it. Cassowary Kick! Hmm. Flightless! Well, well. Who knew you could actually fly? You would be nothing without me! I even collapsed an entire stadium so you could be the hero. - Where is my thanks? - You? You killed my husband! Oh, it's not personal darling. It's strictly business. You're a monster! You know, it's funny. I've made a fortune representing those who wear masks. But I suppose I've been wearing one myself all along. But now that you've ruined that, I guess it's time to start being myself again! CeCe's a Drop Bear! Combat, what's the plan? Run. Definitely run! Flightless! I'm a fraud. I don't even know how to tie my own shoes. Flightless! Run! Come on, Mr. Flightless. Run! Okay, give me a rundown. Chief, I need you to get Sweetie to safety. It's too dangerous here. No! No way, no way! I'm not leaving you! I can't risk you getting hurt. I'll lead her away from everyone. Flightless, follow me. Time to be a real hero. Come on! We're almost there. Okay, what's the plan? The plan, what is it? Have we got one? You've got a plan haven't you? I haven't, so if you've got a plan, a plan would be great. Bring it out now. All right, listen up, Flightless. When I say so, get ready to move. Almost there. Yes! End of the line, bandit scum! That was a really bad idea. Sweetie, get out of here! We're running out of time! Sweetie. You're going to have to let go! Wait, what? Let go? Oh, I can't do this, Maggie. You know what you need to do, Flightless Feather. You can do this! I believe in you! No! No, no, no, no, no! Wait! Wait, wait! - Cassowary Kick! - Butt Power! Sweetie, jump! Oh, I did it! I actually did it! I'm flying! Woo-hoo! Wing-suit engaged. Yes, yes! Woo-hoo! Nice work, Flightless Feather. Oh, Gallant Glider, you are so cool. I want to be like you. Woo-hoo! What? Huh? Please don't tell me that's a... It's a butt! It's just... so big. It's meant to be. It's your butt. Combat! We've actually forget to tick off one last step in the book. Step 21: Epil... Epi-low... Epi-logue... Epilogue! All right. I think I can do this one. My name is Maggie Diggins. I like sleeping in, Bush Bars, and bad TV. I also like to dress up in a ridiculous costume and save animals from time to time. But this mask isn't what makes me a hero. Being a hero is about putting the needs of others above your own. It's being brave and overcoming your fears. It's being the very best version of yourself. And I don't know why anyone would want to hide that behind a mask. Huh. I love you, Bradley. Thank you. For everything. Ready? Ready.
