Coming. I don't want to. What's up? Yes? Isidora, what's going on? - Nothing. What do you mean? You just said something very strange. Something very strange? I was dreaming. Those cats... Go see to them. -I'm on my way. They'll have to wait. Will it be that Dominga has died? Pick up. Enrique, is my mother there? Hello? - Good morning. Is mom there? - Yes. Is she dead? - Worse. Your daughter. Hello? -Hi, Mom. What's up? Nothing much. We're just waking up. We're so lazy. Yes. - How're you? Fine, I just got back from Peru. How was it? - Great. Shall I drop by to show some pictures and tell you how it went? Today? - Yes, Mom. Today. You caught off guard me a bit. - Mama, don't whine. We haven't seen each other in a while. I'll come at six o'clock with a surprise. Rosario, I do not like surprises. - I'll come at six. If you put on tea and buy some sweets, it'll be very cozy. Okay. - Greetings to Enrique. Greetings from Rosario. She's bringing a surprise? Sounds scary. You know what she wants now... Well, she's been traveling. Maybe she just missed you. Come on, Enrique. You know she always needs something. Yes, yes, I'm coming. I'm coming. Come here. Come. Liban, come here. Crazy cat. First you meow and now... Isi. You forgot to buy cat food. Spoiled brat. Poor things, they're starving. I'm going to buy them food. What should I serve for tea? - Doesn't matter. Don't spend too much. I'll be right back. That thing's broken again. What do we need? Cheese, bread... ... Avocado. I don't know. Is Rosario Coming alone or is she bringing Hugo? -I hope not. And please don't call her Hugo. Did you take your pills? No. Isi, it's not you. It's your hips. You can't use the stairs anymore. Call Miguelito, ask when they're fixing the elevator. Scold him for me. Wasn't Virgina going to drop by today and bring something? Tell her not to come. She's really old. I'll be right back. Don't forget the cat, Enrique. Enrique, the cat food. Miguelito, this is Mrs. lsidora. What's wrong with the elevator? When? Tell me a date. You have me shut in here. Virginia, you should not come. The elevator is broken again. The elevator. They'll let me know. No, that's okay. Just bring it another time. The elevator, my dear. Fine. Bye-bye. No, that can't be. No, that's not it. No, it's dangerous. It's not that, it's dangerous. I already told her. I do not need to repeat it. Do I have to say everything twice then? Tell her yourself. Soledad knows exactly. These two never understand anything. They know nothing. I forgot the ham. What's going on? -I was confused. I was confused. Everything is flooded. There's water everywhere. Look, look.- It's flooded. I don't know how long it took. Look anyway. Calm down, Isi. Look. I don't know what I was thinking. I don't know how long it was. I don't know... Enrique, where are you going? Could we have forgotten a pill? - No. I don't know. Don't be like that. This isn't the first time. But this time it was worse. I heard voices. I heard Sole. I'll call your daughter, she shouldn't come. - Don't. Don't tell her. I won't say a thing. You had an appointment. Nothing more. If you call, she will suspect something. - Then call her yourself. I'll tell her I was going to have tea with my friends. Good. She's not answering. - Try again. She won't answer now that I'm like this. She'll still come. - Keep trying till she picks up. But if she comes... I'll be here. I won't leave you alone for a even a moment. Besides, how long can they stay? Two hours? Can you bear two hours? How should I know? How the... That's a whole day's work lost. Lock up the pigs, please! The cats, Enrique. - Yeah, yeah. I know. Mama! Do not let them escape. It's okay, Rosario. - Are they locked up? Are they gone? - Yes, woman. I'm allergic. It's not a joke, open the windows please. The windows, yes. A breath of air with those cats around and I have an immediate allergic reaction. Jesus. And I also had to go up eight flights of stairs stairs because the goddamn elevator's broken. You can't go on living here, Mom. This house will collapse from sadness. Hello, Enrique. How are the books? How's everything? Oh, fine. I've just had computer problems, is all. I have already told her that I'll buy another. Until it loads, it's just fucked up (pun). Did you come by yourself? - Yes. By myself. Look at the gorgeous tea you put together, Mama. Avocado and all these delicious cakes. - It's only a tea. Calm down. You're almost hyperventilating. - Yes. I'm exhausted. I swear, Peru kills me! Beautiful skies, wonderful people, humble... ... But amazing. The food is cheap. We gorged ourselves. We have thousands and thousands of photos. I'll show you. Look, this is a group of backpackers who traveled with us for three days. Can I get youa drink or are we waiting for anyone? Yes, Hugo's coming. That's not a problem, right? Of course she's welcome, but at what time? Because we should save her something. Or should we just hold off entirely till she arrives? - No, she's coming. You look at the photos, Mom. This is an Indian, our guide. A beautiful Indian, a real one. I'll go to the bathroom. You'll just die when you see my surprise, you'll love it. Really. What is the surprise? - It's coming any minute. What delicious juice! What a treat. You going to die when you see the surprise. Isn't it crazy? Look what I found. Mama, Smell this. Smell this one, Enrique. It smells like newly cut grass. How nice this is... - No! It's not that it's nice... ... But it's 100 percent natural and it has a medicinal effect. That sounds wonderful, but I imagine that I would have to buy one to see the effects. No, Mom. It's a gift. Choose one out of all of them. You may also choose one, Enrique. This is good for your skin, like a scrub, but it doesn't scratch. They make it from something strainge, I don't know. Let's see. "The clay takes the dirt and impurities stored in the pores... ... Helps to remove dead skin cells and works rejuvenating. " Enrique, for you. This restores the damaged skin. Like for that spot in your ear. It's very professional. Everything has been researched. I read the leaflet. I'll show you later, but look at the photos. Listen. "Wholesome soaps. " Are no ordinary soaps. "The healing bars of soap from Machu Picchu are traditionally made... ... So the oils and animal fats saponify... ' Blah blah blah. Never mind. The point is that this is something that does not exist in Chile. I found this. Mom, are you there? Are you still there, Mom? -Isi, Which one do you like? I think I like this this one, it's very-- - No, no, don't choose now. There are 25 different ones. Hugo's coming with the rest. Don't call her Hugo. She's a woman, her name is Beatriz. - She wants it that way. End of discussion. Hugo is not a woman's name. - End of discussion. I'll go. It is Virginia. Virginia, wait. I'll come open the door for you. But mom, I thought we were going to have tea together, just us? Didn't you tell her about the elevator? I don't know. - You're really forgetful. I called her. - Did you call her or not? Oh, be quiet you. The elevator is out. - Go home! You cannot come up, the elevator is broken. Go home. Enrique, you go down and tell her. -No, no What? You want me to go down? Hey, just go. You're really stubborn. - What are you talking about? You can't live in these conditions. You can't even have visitors with a that elevator. If something bad happens- this neighborhood gets more dangerous every day. I want to tell you something important. Why don't we sit down? Do you want some juice? Mom, I'm really worried about your health. You must think about your future. What future, honey? - Don't talk nonsense. I have something to ask you. Listen first, before you say no. Look, I propose that I've found you an apartment that's much more comfortable. On the first floor, with a garden for the cats, in a quiet neighborhood. I can help you with things better than Jose Manuel because he has become quite busy with his family and other concerns. But if you want me to help you... Mama, look at me. If you want me to help you, you must give me the rights to the apartment. This is not difficult. It's very simple. Is this the surprise or the soaps? - They're both the surprise. It's very simple. It's only two pages. Take a look. Read it. Should I grab your glasses? I don't have glasses. - I know. I'm just teasing. It's a simple power of authorization form for the notary, Because Esteban-- Remember Esteban? He wants to do us a favor, so we don't have to go through the whole process and stand in line. Why don't we wait for Enrique? That'd be better. - But why? He's not my father. He has nothing to do with this. Yes, but... - But what? You can't trust your daughter once in your life? That poor woman didn't understand a word you said. Have a juice. You look exhausted. Do you fighting again? - No... Mama is back acting like she does not understand and I want to help her, but she says... What is this? - Is it not clear? How can you come here with this without even discussing it with us? No, no, no... And why not? This apartment was my father's and so it should be mine too. I don't know why you are staying here. Why are you interfering? - This is my house. - That is clear. Should I wait to intefere until she goes mad or dies? You have to help support me and Mom. - I do that already! I'm still here, you know. - I know that too. That is Virginia again. - That stupid old bitch. Wait. I'm coming to get you. That's Hugo. She has loads of soap with her. How do you feel? Good. Alert. That harpy can't make me sign anything. She thinks I've lost it. - This is a big hustle. Believe me. Well, they're already here, right? Hello, Rosario. - Hello. How's my baby? You've been sniffing. Is there any left? - Yes, upstairs. It's eight storeys up and the elevator is broken. How do they like the soaps? - Great. I've told them a lot. And you have the apartment? That old fart doesn't trust me and my mom is stubborn. I need your help. I'm not leaving without that signature. Ugh, these fucking stairs. So the soaps were nice? I have many more. These are for special diseases. They may have to do with your mood or or other specific conditions. See, like I said. We were like smugglers at the border. Did we have to pay or what? That wasn't so bad. - Your tea is getting cold, Beatriz. Hugo. - Sorry. I try, but I find it difficult. It's a little weird, right? - Yes. Say Hugo, are you still working with that "Adventure Tourism"? Yes, I teach skydiving. What a strange thing. - No, it's nice, really. People of all ages do it. You could also. Over my dead body. - No, it's very safe. If you would like, we could jump together. Look at her face! You all don't want to jump. She is afraid too. No, it's that the training is difficult and I'm busy with casting. Last week a TV station phoned to see my reel. I had forgotten you were an actress. How nice. Did you take videos of her when you were little? They should be here somewhere. She was always an attention hog, this one. What are you talking about? Can we see them? - If we can dig them out of all this stuff. No, no, what a drag. Why aren't we discussing what we need to discuss? And what do we need to discuss? - With you? Nothing. I believe they're in the closet. Would you help me, Beatriz? - Mama! Never mind. Where have I put them? -It was in the office that I saw them last. Teresa! - Enrique, the cats. Don't put them in the kitchen, that's disgusting. - What is it? It's a cat. - A pig. Cut it out. - Not in the kitchen. It is their home. You don't get to change everything around here. Go away, go away, get! Hey, dummy! Why did you do that? Jesus, who raised you? It's just a cat! Why the obsession with these animals? It's from a lack of grandchildren. What did you say? What? - Rosario, calm down. She kicked him? - No, nothing happened. Where do I put it down? - Here. My little darling. They don't understand. They are usually the kings of the house and now they are trapped. You should give cats affection every day, otherwise they think you no longer love them. Same with Charo. These are all the videos we have. - Look. Are they all of Rosario? - No, it's everything. We haven't watched them in a century. - This could be it. 'Rosario. Do Not erase. " Let's watch this. Of course, if you like. How old are you there? - Seventeen. I was great. The teachers loved me. You were much thinner. -I was much younger, really good. I was good, good, good. I have already told you. What is it, Mom? Who are you talking to? -Is this all? It's missing all kinds of information, conditions ... I dunno. Who drafted this? - It is an official document. This doesn't look good. Are you going to make money from the sale? Of course, like all real estate brokers. It's a job. Don't you get tired of taking money from your mother? How many loans have we made you these last few years? - We? Enrique, please. What do you want money for this time? -I don't have to explain anything to you. Mommy. Look, the money is not for me. It's an investment. In a serious business, a provemen business. It can not go wrong, do you understand? Another new company? This is why I didn't want to tell them. They always bring me down. We have done market research. This is serious. Like with the tupperware and ceramics? -I tell you. I can't believe you. The soaps. -No. They are 'wellness-centric, environmentally- sustainable bars of soap". The idea is to export it... ... And then to find a venue to sell them. We thought... -Nothing more to say. How long will you screw around like this? You're an adult. It's not screwing around. -Don't bother. They always treat me like this. Hugo, listen, we've been through this so many times. The kindergarten that she wanted to open. The retreat to study acting. But she did not study and blew all the money. Millions of pesos. Who do you think you are, you old bastard? I need a break. Enrique, please. What do you want? Why don't you leave me alone? You're not gonna take any more of that shit in your mother's house. Act like an adult. -Crazy old son of a bitch. What do you think you know, moron? Maybe lsidora doesn't realize about your little trips to the bathroom, but you don't fool me. Ahh, so you're the clever one... Shall we let them squabble? How beautiful. They must be doing a commercial. What is it? Is something wrong? Anything new inside? -No, they are still going at it. It's hard for Rosario. She is a good person underneath it all. I love her. What do you two know about love? Please. Don't be a vulture. -So you say, asshole. Living like a parasite off of my mother. Pull yourself together and do something decent with your life. How long must we be the only ones that buy your hammocks, your makeup... And your hideous ceramics. -Listen, you prick, When my mom dies, you will have nothing. I will ensure that there's nothing left for you but hideous ceramics. What's going on? -This jerk. Tell him. -Are you crazy? Enrique, you'd better check on your wife. What are you doing? Don't be desperate, okay? Don't cry, don't cry. Give me a kiss. Shut the door. That old bastard stopped me. A bump? Hang on. I need your help. We must remain calm. -You should not fight with the old man. Goddamnit, this is so not gonna work. My mother is stranger than ever. The old witch. Maybe your mom is confused. -She pretends. I'm serious. My grandmother behaved the same way when she was going senile. Let her have her "incapacitated state". I won't be taken in by it. She is hard as stone, cold and egotistical. Even now. She never loved me. That much is clear. How are you? It's Jose Manuel. -Now? They're going to tell him. Enrique is going to tell him. I'm going. -No, I'm going. You stay here. Hide. Wait. Okay. Quiet . -If you go outside, shut the door. Relax a little. Hello, Manuel. How are you? What is it, little sister? I stop by my mother's house for a second and I end up in the middle of a fight. How long will this go on, honestly? I mean it, this goes for both of you. How long? -Did they ask you to come? No. Vale needed a book. Valentina, what are you doing hiding in the corner? -Hi, how are you? Hello, everyone. I'm mad at you. -Why? Why? You disappered for quite a while. You didn't come to my ceramics studio, you never returned my calls, nothing. I know, but I'm so busy. I have exams, I have so much to do. I have to read a lot. Look. Yes, but don't leave me in the lurch. Are we still friends? Listen, soon we must go shopping, just us two, okay? Good. You have my number, right? -And you have, mine, huh? Or have you deleted it? -No, I still have it. Honey, we gotta go. -Yes. Bye, Grandma. - Why don't you stay for tea? No, we have to arrange something for Vale. You should take a look at the document here. -It's two pages, Jose Manuel. That's enough, Mom. Don't worry, it's not important. Rosario, this is my house. You provoked all of this. Manuelito has a right to know. -What? What should he know? -Hold the hell on with the bickering. Let's see. Sit down. Be careful of my soaps. -Rosario, please. Give me your hand, Mom. Just one time, forgive each other for every mistake the other has made. Please, love each other a little. How much time do you have left together? Enjoy it. It's my fault, but I go crazy when they treat me like a child, that's all. Listen. Grab her hand. Look at her. She's your daughter. Look at each other. Look at each other. Mama. You see? You can do it. God's sake. It's so easy. I gotta go. See, I know my women. Listen, the issue of that document is important. Bye, Grandma. -Bye. Bye, Rosario. -Bye, Valentine. Take care. Sorry about the elevator. -Bye, Mom. Why did you call Jose Manuel? Why do you always think I cheat you? Why did you let him see the contract? Trust me! Trust me . -Should we start again? You seem upset. -Not true. It's always the same. I am not an impostor, a thief or a whore. I just want to help my mother, Damn. We already told you, Rosario. Manuelito was stopping by. We did not know he was coming. We will never understand each other. Its ruining things between us. Are you going? -No, she's not going. I'm going to put the kettle on. Calm down. Just calm down. I'm worn out. Let's clean up the soaps, before they all melt. Enrique, Beatriz... Yes? -Hugo, Mom. Enrique, Hugo... You should go shopping for a while and leave us alone. That's not good. You know that. We both need it. Now. Right, Rosario? Yes, Mom. Isidora, what did we agree on? What did we say? Now, now. It's not so bad. Go buy some snacks and come back. -Okay, I just want to grab money. I already know what you're going to say, but it's now or never. Now or Never? How? You're her mother. Yes. This is the worst moment of your life. I have to take advantage of the few brains I have left. Please take this, it's a little reminder. For if you get lost. "DON'T SIGN ANYTHING." -Don't be silly. Is it silly? -Okay, let's go. Listen, don't fight too much with Rosario. No, no don't worry. Do you want to try a Turkish sweet? A friend of mine sells Turkish delicacies. She is also a dyke. Do you know what that is, a dyke? Maybe we should go back. -What? No, come now. Let them solve their problems. Did I mention that my grandmother also made Turkish delicacies? You wanted them to leave us alone. What do you want? For us to get along? Does it disgust you when I touch you? -Rosario, Please. According to my therapist I never received affection. That's not true. I'm just not a person who shows affection easily. No, I know. But Mom... ...Tell me one memory you have with me. This has nothing to do with that. -But, Mom... One memory that us we have together. Mom, search your mind. Try to remember. Find one thing. Anything that can make us laugh. Something. When I had you... ... I was- I don't know. I was already old. I was not ready to have another child. This could have influenced you... I recognize that it's been difficult. That may have affected you. - Yes, but let's face it I love you very much, especially now that you're so vulnerable. But what I'm trying to say... Damn. Why don't you let me help you? Look. What do you see here that you don't understand? I can explain it. No. -Mama, it's very simple. Anyone can understand. You're not interested in resolving anything between us. You only want money. As always. For God's sake, Mom. It's pathetic, you're so transparent. Just admit that you want money. It all comes down to money. And, why, do you think? Why, do you think, witch? You don't love me! You have never loved me! It's your fault. That's why I take your money. I'm returning all the love that you gave me, and damn it, there fucking wasn't any! Stupid bitch. What have you done? What have you done? Rosario, please. I couldn't resist. -Come. Want some? -No. What are you doing here? -And your mother? Isidora! What is it? Are you crying? -She went downstairs. What? That's impossible. You didn't see her? -How could you have let her down those stairs? How long has she been gone? We have to find her. Come on. She can take care of himself. Better than you can. With me she can't play the victim. What victim, you idiot? She is sick. -Sick? Your mother is sick and elderly. And you're a grown woman. When will it finally get through to you? Shall we go? Come on. Something happened. What did she say? - Nothing. Nothing happened. Enrique ... Honey, your mother's not well. Listen. You're the only one who knows where she might be. Where do you think she went? Think. Where did you two used to go? This work is no joke. It is important for all of us. You should take it seriously. Please, I'm serious. Probably Saturday. Tell him he's done. I want to know if you've seen an old woman with a blond page hairstyle. Look... We will find her. She must be close. Did you get my mobile number? If something happens, call me. Do not give up. Hello? -Have you found her, Hugo? No, there is no one here, no one. It's so big. Where are you? Well, I'm near the binoculars. See anything, Hugo? -Wait, I'm looking. There are bees. Who? -The bees that we saw from the balcony. There she is. Damn. Was it her or not? -I'm not sure. Do you have a coin? Rosario? -No, Enrique. Where? Here? What are you doing, Mom? What are you doing here? What's wrong with you? Relax. I'm with you We're leaving. Relax, it'll be fine. Go ahead. Thank you. Sit. We have to turn. Thank you. Can I have a towel? Be calm, Mama Don't worry, mama Come back. Come back. Rosario. -Yes, Mommy. I'm here, Rosario. Relax. Calm down. It's my fault I got you upset. Forgive me, my child. -It's okay, Mom. Let me through. What happened? -Nothing, it's okay. Okay? I went crazy. I'm going crazy. -Nonsense. That is your age. You're not crazy - Okay, Mom. I'm glad you love my daughter. Thank you, Hugo. Yes, oh, It's a little crowded here. What are you looking at? Come. Careful. What were you thinking? -Will you leave us alone? How did you get there? What happened? Calm down, easy now Very slowly. Very slowly. Mom, there's nothing to worry about. Relax. Yes, baby steps. You still have seven flights of stairs to climb. Right, Mom. -It's fine. Shall we swap? Why are you making such a strange noise? What is going on? Just pause. Okay, it's okay. I have a memory. I have a memory. You crossed a river and the water came up to your waist. The other children were on the other side. You were... Very small You followed them ... But they ignored you because you still very small And you know what I did? I let you go and let you go alone. And you got to the other side. You swallowed some water, but you got to the other side. I don't remember that, Mom Come on Isi, you'l catch a cold. -Give me the shoes. Come on, Mom. Careful. Relax. Lean on us. Good. Yes, very. Very carefully. I'll sign the document. Mom, don't talk silly. You threw it out. She tore it up and threw it away. It's true. Bring it this week. Well, I have it in my e-mail. I download it and print it. Do you have internet and a printer? -Yes Now, how can I enlarge it? There it is. -What's wrong? I press print, and hit does nothing. Maybe you should turn it off and reboot the computer. That is the disc, maybe if we reload it. Wait. But why... Can you close the door? I get trouble with my allergies. This is madness, lsidora. Are you sure you want this? -Yes Then we move everything. Imagine, all our stuff. The books, the paintings... The cats will find it equally difficult. That memory that I told Rosario wasn't true. That happened to me when I was little. Not her. I'm not here anymore. Okay, that's enough. Come back another day. Old Cats submissive Translation by: Ruinpeople Sunshinefiasco
