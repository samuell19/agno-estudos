Why do we have to do this now? Because he's got a few drinks in him and he's ready to sign. Chris... Come on. Just flirt with him for a few minutes, then I'll go to my secretary's office... Stewart? All present and accounted for. Great. Why don't we return to my office and we can close the deal. Hmm? After you. There you go. OK. Here is to the first of what I think will be many land development deals between McMillan and Slider Investments. I will drink to that. Mm. Honey, will you entertain him for just a minute while I go grab those contracts? Excuse me. That's, um... that's beautiful perfume you're wearing. Thank you very much. Mr. McMillan, my husband... Your husband will be busy for a few minutes. Please don't. He said entertain me. And I have a very strong feeling you know how important this is to him. What are you trying to say? Nothing at all. It's just that there are so many developers who have offered me even more lucrative deals. Chris. Chris? Well, it was a great evening, Stewart. Let's do it again sometime real soon. All of us. Hey. You find the McMillan contracts? Yep, I sure did. I gotta tell you, I was a little surprised to see them when I came in this morning. Yeah, we were here a little late last night. Summer, meet Nicole Garrett. So nice to meet you. You're Rob, right? Yeah, I've heard a lot of nice things about you. George. George, nice to meet you. I know John Wells from the other company. Oh, yeah. What's all that about? I think they're hiring somebody new. It took you long enough to get here. It really did! But thank you so much. My pleasure. Chris? Hey. What are you doing sitting here alone? Chris, what's the matter? It's the vice presidency, isn't it? You didn't get it. Not exactly. Well, tell me, what exactly? Exactly I got fired. Fired? I... I don't understand. They're bringing in some hot shot executive from outside, so somebody had to go. But hey, they were nice enough to give me six months' severance and a glowing recommendation. Chris, there's plenty of stuff out there. You'll find something else. Ann, I'm 38 years old. You can't start over again at 38. You're 38 years old. It's not going to be easy, but... I can't begin again at some entry level position. I was in line for a VP, for Christ's sake. You know I'll help you. Hey, whatever it takes. You don't understand. What about... what about all our plans for having a family? We're carrying two mortgages on this house. Timing is all wrong. Everything's all wrong. Honey. I'm so sorry. Darla, you're going to be late! Yeah, yeah, as usual. Is that your new school uniform? What's wrong with it? You're going to catch cold. Karina, you know I don't touch red meat. It's not red meat, it's bacon. Well, it looks red to me. Well, somebody better eat it. There's tons of it out in the garage freezer and it's going to go bad. Give it to Mom. You know how she enjoys her daily pound of flesh. Did I hear my name? We were just talking. Mom, please. When you do that, can you go into the other room? It's gross. Sorry. I didn't mean to upset your delicate... what are you wearing? Nothing. Exactly. Go put on a decent shirt. Mom, everyone is wearing these. I don't care what everyone is wearing. I will not have you going around in public half-naked. Well, I'm almost 18 and I can do what I want. No, you can't, not while you are living in this house. Hey, hey, hey. What's the fuss? Your daughter has decided to become a lingerie model. She's young. Let her have fun. Naturally, you take her side. I'm not taking anybody's side. I just don't see the harm in her expressing herself. Fine! I don't have time to argue about this. This is my first day at a new job and I'm stressed out already. Shit! Karina, I told you to get this damn thing fixed! I'll call today. I'm going to be late. Just get it fixed and don't forget my refill at the drugstore. Sure thing, Mrs. G. So she got her broom out of the closet early this morning. Oh, Karina, would you mind getting me a refill as well? Don't you want to have some breakfast? No, no, I don't have much of an appetite. Oh, my God. There he is. There's Travis. OK. Just stay calm, OK? Act, you know, casual. Hi. Hey. I'm Darla. Travis. You're in my chemistry class. Yeah. You sit, like, two rows behind me. Oh! You noticed me. Oh, that's so cool. Yeah. You go girl. Well, by now, you've all had a chance to meet Mrs. Nicole Garrett, our new VP of Sales and Development. She comes to us with impressive credentials and an unbeatable track record with one of our rival firms whose name we never mention out loud. Well, will you excuse me a moment? There's something I have to attend to. I'll be right back. I have been waiting here for 20 minutes. I will not be snubbed by you or anybody else. My husband was at this company for eight years! And I want to see Mr. Slider now! You bastard. You killed him. You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! Should I call security? I'll take care of it. Don't you touch me! You took his life away. You don't know what he went through to bring in that McMillan account. And you fire him? Listen to me, Ann, all right? Honey, this is hard for me to say this, but this firm has been courting Ian McMillan for a long time now. I threw Chris a bone. I knew he needed the commission. Fact is, Chris hasn't brought any business into this firm in the last 15 months at least. I worked so hard for him. I know Chris was a good man. I'm... I'm so sorry. He was counting on that vice presidency. He wasn't even in the running. This firm's been wooing Nicole Garrett for months now. I'm so sorry that he misunderstood. You used him. I'm sorry. Mr. Ritzer is on line one from Tokyo. All right. Both you and have been working on my team. I saw the investment planner you did on the Riker account, I thought it was great. So good job. Good luck to us all in the future. Hey, I'm home! Got through my first day at Slider Investments! Hey. Hey. Congratulations, honey. Thanks. So I guess that means we're going to be seeing even less of you now, huh? Is there some hidden meaning in that? No. No, I, um got some news for you. You'll never guess who didn't show up for school again today. Oh, Jesus. Where is she? She's in her room. Hey, no, no, no! It's OK. It's OK. I talked to her. She's fine. I'm sure that did a lot of good. Well, it's better than yelling at her. Maybe if you just treated her like a person, Nicole, instead of a child... Honey, she is a child. Well, why do you think she's doing all of this stuff, huh? The clothes and skipping school? She is at that age right now where she needs you. She needs her mother. Oh. So this is all my fault? No, I'm not... if you just put half of the amount of energy you put into your career into this family... What am I supposed to do? Quit my job, stay home, and bake cookies? Somebody has to make some real money for this family. Yeah, well all I know is that you wanted to buy this house before we were ready to buy it. You also wanted to start this family before we were ready to start it. So now you've got a son on academic probation and you've got a very confused 18-year-old daughter, Nicole. And naturally, you take no responsibility for that. Of course not. You don't take responsibility for anything that happens around here. Give me a break. Fine! I'll handle it. I'll handle it just like I handle everything else in this family. Unlock this door. I said, unlock this door now! Hey, Mom. How was the old corporate grind? Cut the crap, Darla. I know you didn't go to school today. I went. I just didn't stay. Listen here, young lady. Your father may let you get away with murder, but not me. I will not let you ruin your last year of high school. Oh, yeah, yeah, Mom. Like you make a perfect role model. You had David when you were, like, what, my age? I am sick of your attitude. You are grounded for two weeks! No TV and no phone and no allowance for a month. No allowance? I've got to have money! Then maybe you'll think twice before cutting school again. Bitch. Do you want to make that two months? Did you hear something? No. Go back to sleep, baby. There's somebody down there. I heard it. Wait right here. Scott. Yeah? I just want to apologize, honey. I'm not exactly in the mood right now. What else is new? Stop it! Oh, God, you're drunk. Go sleep it off somewhere else. Fuck you. Not tonight, dear. Darla? Yes, Daddy? Honey, is everything OK in here? Sure, Daddy. Everything's fine. OK. Good night, sweetie. Night, Daddy. That was close. Are you sure we won't get caught? Trust me, Janelle. Mom's out and Dad's bombed! I mean, I could have, like, a whole hockey team in here and they never even know it. Did you get those pastries for brunch tomorrow? Yes, ma'am. And I called the plumber about the disposal. And? He said don't count on it till next week. Oh, terrific. Where's Darla? Come and gone. Of course. Where's Mr. Garrett? Left about an hour ago. He left? Did he say where he was going? No, ma'am. But he did have his work clothes on. Did he say when he'd be back? Sorry. Damn! I left my chemistry notebook back at the house. So? You don't actually need it, do you? Well, I've got all my homework in it. God. What is going on? This thing, it gets stuck. Usually works if you get closer. Hey! While we're young! I'm trying. I'm trying. Karina? Karina! Darla? Oh. Nicole? Nic? Are you OK? What happened? Did... did you take your insulin today? Yeah, it's not that. It's just... it's been a terrible day. Oh, come here. Come here. Let's get you in bed. Come on. A gas leak, as near as I can tell. The whole house went up. Oh, my God. Yeah. Needless to say, the whole place was nuts. Hey. You know what the doctor says about stress. Makes your blood sugar go way up. I thought I could handle it. You want something to eat? Mm-hmm. Here. Where is Karina? Is it her day off or something? Uh, yes and no. She, uh... she left this little note in the kitchen. Had a family emergency. Oh, geez. Perfect end to a perfect day. I bet I know how to make it better. Mm. This is really nice. Open. You're making a mess. When is Karina coming back? She didn't say. Hey, I said no stress. Hello? Yes, she is. Hold on one second. This is Mrs. Garrett. You're from where? The agency, regarding Katrina Kozlos? Yeah, when is she coming back? Well, I'm afraid she had to leave the country permanently. She had a family emergency. Well, I'm going to need somebody right away. I understand completely. I can have someone with excellent references there for you first thing in the morning. No, no. I won't have any time to spend with her tomorrow morning. Well, she's extremely efficient, a self-starter. I assure you, you will not be inconvenienced in the least. I personally recommend her. OK, if she can be here tomorrow exactly at 7:00, I can spend a few minutes and familiarize her with the house. Great. Oh, you're just going to love her. Are you from the agency? Yes, ma'am. OK, we'll start in the kitchen. That's the most important. Dishwasher needs to be unloaded. Placement is self-explanatory. Just check through the cabinet. Breakfast is light... juice, coffee, croissants, whatever. I like dinner on the table at 7:00. We left you a menu. You do cook, don't you? Laundry room is in here. Lingerie gets double fabric softener. Mr. Garrett likes his dress shirts with light starch. Anything that needs to be washed will just be in the laundry bin. I don't care if you watch television while you work or listen to the stereo, just keep it down. Local calls are fine. Anything long distance, I'll just take out of your check. Help yourself to anything in the fridge, but I detest... I mean, loathe... little containers of leftovers or anything wrapped in foil. That's what this is for. I do a lot of entertaining, so we always have to be prepared. It'll be your responsibility to make sure it's well stocked. Oh, my God! What a mess! Darla must have been in here. I like all the leftovers to be on this side. Darla, my daughter, goes to school at 8:15. She'll need a lunch. When she comes home at 3:30, she should have some sort of protein. Now, she won't eat red meat, so any kind of fish or chicken would be fine. So is it just the three of you, then? I have a son. He's away at school. He'll be back next week. Any special dietary needs I should know about? Yes. I'm a diabetic, so low carbs, low fat, and no sugar. It's all in the menu I left for you. I see. Look, let's just get through today. I should be home about 6:30. My number is on the board in case of any emergencies. I do want to know if my daughter is home by 4 o'clock. If not, she's grounded. Other than that, handle it. Oh! Would you like to see my references? Tonight. Anna. Excuse me? Anna Johnson. Fine. Anna. My husband and my daughter should be down soon. I was right. You are a bitch. Darla, come on! You're going to be late! Can I have my allowance, Dad? Wait a minute. You're on financial probation. Mm, mm, mm, mm. Because I love you. Keep it between you and me. Thanks, Daddy. Good morning. Where's Karina? Honey, I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you she had an emergency. Hi. Hi, I'm Anna. I'm Scott. And this is my daughter, Darla. Look, I'm late for a meeting. I assume my wife filled you in on everything. And if you need anything at all, my number's right there on the board. Honey, have a great day. Bye-bye. Hey, is that the new October issue? Yeah. There's a great spread on Lorenzo's new line. You're going to love it. Yeah, his stuff's pretty cool. Oh, I packed you a lunch, but I wasn't sure what you liked, so I sort put in a variety. I hope that's OK. Got to go! All right. Well, have a good day. I'll be home around 5:30. 4:00. Ugh, whatever. Hello! It's 3:52 in case Mommie Dearest calls. Come in! Did you leave these here? Yeah, I'm finished with them. I thought you might like to look through them. Thanks. Oh, there's a pair of shoes... on page 139, I think... to die for. Yeah, those are pretty amazing. Well, you've got the legs for them. Yeah, right. I look like an ostrich in heels. Oh, come on, look at you. You're tall. Get yourself one of those clingy little Dolce tops, you'll be a knockout. Get yourself one of those sassy little skirts, you do something with your hair... You think so? What size shoe do you wear? Usually 7 and 1/2. I have the perfect platform strappy sandal. I'll bring them. Hey, what are you making? It's Italian night. Smells great. Tastes good. You're way too young for this right now. Hi, honey! Mrs. Garrett. Wow, we're all here. Dinner will be ready promptly at 7 o'clock. No, no hurry. Finish with your conversation or whatever. I'm just going to go and freshen up. The house looks lovely. Thank you. Listen. You're too young to hear this. No, you stay... Tofu noodles. Anna, you are so creative. You know, I've been on this diet for years. And I have never tasted anything so good. Well, thank you very much. Oh, Mrs. Garrett, your garbage disposal was broken. So I went out into the garage and I found an old washer. I hope that's OK. You fixed it? Yeah. Is there anything you can't do? Oh, let me get you your plates for you. No, no. I'll get this. You know, Anna, this is by far the best Italian food I've ever had. Thanks. Ann, that was great. You will be back tomorrow? Well, I could fill in temporarily, but it's actually... I'm looking for a live-in position. Well, you know, Nicole thinks you're great. And, well, we all do. And we certainly could use the help around here. What's going on? Oh. I was just asking Anna if she'd like to stay on, take Karina's place. Oh. Don't you think we should talk about this first? Well, you just said how great she is. I know, honey. It really doesn't have anything to do with Anna. It's just that I think this should be a family discussion. Kind of like your new job? Anna, would you excuse us for a minute? Why? If she's going to work here, she'd better get used to the sound of raised voices. All right, Scott. That's enough. Oh, I see. You can do whatever the hell you want around here, and then when I make a decision, everything has to go to a committee. I am not going to stand here and argue with you about this! Then fine, it's all settled. Anna, you come back tomorrow and bring your bags with you. You're hired. Thank you. Don't worry. It's all going to work out. I know. Hey. How was school? Oh, that good, huh? Here, try this. What is it? A fruit smoothie. Healthy. Wow. That is a lot better than that stuff Karina used to make. I almost forgot. Come here. Come on. Follow me. Voila! Oh, man! These are sweet! Well, they're yours. No way. Are you kidding? These are incredible. I have got to pay you for them. Oh, please. I have got so many clothes and so many pairs of shoes. You think everything's going to fit in that armoire? You know, I'm really glad you're staying with us. Yeah, so am I. Maybe you could help me pick out a dress for the dance on Saturday night? Hello. Who are you going with? Just Janelle. Oh, that is the perfect way to go to a dance. You don't want to be stuck with one guy all night long. You want to dance with whoever you want. Hey, not one second past 6 o'clock. Oh, thank you! OK. It's between you and me. You know, Anna, I'm really happy about the shoes. Yeah, well, get out of here. Go on. Got those demographics you wanted. Thank you. You OK? Yeah, I'm fine. Could you see if they could turn the heat down or something? It's 65. It's freezing in here. Well, turn it down another notch. I'm dying. I might as well give up. I just don't have anything that's going to work. I'm just going to the dance dressed like a geek. No, you're not. You are not going to be dressed like a geek wearing this. Now this is perfect for a Saturday night. Oh, Anna, look at it. I am. You look beautiful. With a little shadow, a little contour here. Maybe we'll even put your hair up. Gorgeous. My mom is never going to let me out of the house like this. Oh, come on. You look so pretty. It's because she grew up here. She said that growing up in Beverly Hills made her grow up too fast. She said that status, looks, and money are all part of a shallow morality. So she decided I should be a nerd with no life except for school. Well, you are no nerd now. Hey, you know your parents are going to a cocktail party on Saturday night at your mom's new firm. Would you help me? Sworn to secrecy? Pinky swear. OK. Definitely the velvet. You think so? Yeah, it's really sexy. All right. The velvet it is. Such a lovely neckline. Maybe if you wore a nice push up bra, it would suit the dress, too. You might be right. Mrs. Garrett, would it be OK if I took a little dip in the pool this evening? Oh. Sure! We pay so much money to heat it and clean it. Somebody should use it. Thank you. So we take it like this. Kind of go forward like sort of... like a Veronica Lake thing. And this goes back like... the Hollywood way, you know? You got like that. See how pretty that looks falling around your shoulders and your neck line? It looks so pretty. I think we'll be a little late tonight. No problem. Have a great time. I'll hold down the fort. Thank you. Thanks for everything, Anna. Sure. Bye. Have they left? They're out of here. Oh, you look beautiful. Look at you. You look so sexy. You knock them dead tonight. There's Janelle. Got to go. OK. Be careful! All right. Bye. Bye. Where is he? I haven't seen him yet. What if he doesn't come? He'll be here. I heard Janice Milford tell Renee Blath that Lorna Summers was coming with Travis. That slut! Yeah. And Janice also told Renee that she was sure Travis was going to get lucky. How would she know? Darla, duh, they talk about that stuff right out loud in the bathroom. Oh, my God. There he is. There he is! Go! Who the hell is that? No, all I know is he got a lot more action off my wife than I ever did! He was drunk! Something you should be able to understand. Are you having an affair? Oh, God! Because that would explain it, Nicole. That would explain everything. That would explain your headaches. That would explain your long hours. And it also explains that dress. What are you talking about? See? I should have known you weren't pushing them up for my benefit. I'm tired. I'm going to bed. - Naturally. Don't want to talk about this anymore! So fine! Just walk away and ignore me and ignore your daughter! Who cares? As long as we don't get in your way! Oh, damn. God, I am so dead. Well, maybe they're asleep already. Right, Janelle. Happy hour isn't even over yet. Well, sneak around the back and go in through the window. Well, whatever happens, it was so worth it. If you're not gonna, would you mind if I did? No. No, not at all. Is scotch OK? Yeah, perfect. Thanks. Mrs. Garrett said it was all right if I used the pool, so I hope that's OK with you. Oh, no, that's fine. I didn't even know you were home. Sorry. Otherwise, I would have been a little less immodest. Oh, it's... it's no problem. It's fine. I just was expecting you two home a lot later. Well, Nicole and I, we don't do too well in public. Well, all marriages have their rough patches. I'm sorry. I'm not trying to be nosy. It's just that sometimes, it really helps to get things off your chest. Can I ask you something? Sure. What would you do if someone always made you feel like you didn't matter? Scott, you have to understand Nicole. Women. She doesn't mean to be hard or... or even cruel. It's just the way she is. It's all she can be. That's why she is where she is today. It's all about her. Look, I'm not making excuses for her, but maybe you have to understand her limitations. She just used to be so different. So warm. And I keep waiting for that Nicole to come back. I love her so much. I swear, I'd do anything for her. Have you... have you ever felt like that? I understand completely. And I miss her. I miss her. Hey. Hey. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Darla. Darla. Darla. What are you doing in here? I was waiting for you. Are you OK? Oh, my gosh, I had a blast. Travis asked me to dance twice. Really? It's like I was a different person. Oh. It's like for the first time, he actually saw me instead of looking through me. Anna, he asked me out. You're kidding! What did he say? You have to tell me everything. Well, first, I went with Janelle, and he was with this other girl, right? And we're, like, walking. You never did? No, I never did. And I hate crossword puzzles. I don't think you'd admit it if you ever did anyway. OK, I think we should start with a little country western. I think it's time for me to clean the kitchen. Alright honey, come on. Mom? Dad? Anybody home? David. We'll do a duet. Yeah, we'll just have our own little variety show for when your mom gets up. Who the hell is that? Well, I don't even know what bovine means. OK. Playwright Simon. Neil Simon. Here you go, David. Thank you. All right, David. Let's hear about school. What do you want to know? I want to know how I'm spending my money. Professors are dull. Girls are hot. What about your grades? Grade point's coming up. See that it does. Now, come on, don't pressure him, Nic. He's going through a huge transition right now. It's not pressure. Its focus. Seems like old times, don't it? So Dad, you responsible for the new housekeeper? Actually, uh, well, yes and no. Your mother really found her. Thanks, Mom. Hey, that's enough. Eat your dinner. Mom? Are you all right? Yeah. Yeah, honey. I'm fine. Go ahead. Dig in. What are you doing? David. Hi. You're up late. I couldn't sleep. Yeah, me either. I was just about to heat up some milk. Why don't you run upstairs and I'll bring some up to you. You sure? That's what I'm here for, to serve you. Hey, Ann! Have they left yet? Yeah, they just left. Come here. How do I look? You look absolutely adorable. I'm supposed to go out with Travis again tonight. Well, that's what you wanted, isn't it? More than anything. I just have to find a way to get past mom. I almost got caught last time. Would you like me to poison her tea? I'm sure you'll think of something. Darla? What? I thought you were, like, what, 12? I'm 17 and 1/2. Oh. You look pretty good for a sister. I got to go. Hey. Hey. Sorry about all that laundry. Oh, no problem. What's this, pizza sauce? Probably. Then we probably should wash this, too? While we're at it, maybe we should do a full load. Nicole. Nicole, pick up the phone. Nicole? Nicole. They're waiting for you, Nicole. Pick up the phone. Nicole? My God. Nicole, wake up. I was power napping. You're late for the Ritzer meeting. What? Is it after 11:00 already? Yup. It has been for 15 minutes. They can't start without you. Why didn't you come and get me? I've been paging you every two seconds. You haven't answered my calls. Nicole, don't take this wrong, OK? You don't look so good. How am I supposed to take that? I'm serious. You OK? Yeah, I'm fine. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm making a doctor's appointment for you first thing in the morning. - No! Don't do that, please. I'm fine. Really. I'm just... I'm overworked. I'll make sure that I get some good sleep tonight. You sure? Yeah. - All right. Come on. You better go. You got a bunch of pissed off suits in there. My apologies. Conference call from London. I couldn't get off. Well, shall we get started? It's nice. Scott, wake up. What? What? There's somebody in the garage and Darla's not in her room. Well, honey, maybe she's... maybe she wants to be alone. No, no! I saw a lighter or something. And you don't think she's doing drugs. Come on! Oh, god. What the hell is going on here? Oh, geez. Darla! Get in the house right now! Mom, please! Darla, right now! Do what your mother says! Come on! No, Dad! And you! What the hell is your name? I, uh... I said what's your name! Get out of here! Honey, calm down. Calm down? Your health. My health is fine! It's his health that's in jeopardy right now! How could you do that? What's going on? Sounds like a typical night in Casa de Garrett. Well, you better check it out. Don't even think about using this. Darla, are you in there? Darla? Darla! Darla! Aw, man. Aw, man. Dad! Help! Oh, god, somebody help! Dad! Dad! Help! Help! Somebody help! God, somebody help! Oh, God, no, baby. What's happening? Call 9-1-1! I'll do it. Oh. It was a beautiful service, Dad. I'll get it. Carlo, thanks so much for being here. Claire, thanks. Hello. Hi. I'm Angela. I'm looking for Scott Garrett. That's my father. Please, come in. Oh, I'm so sorry about your mother. He's in the living room. OK. Thanks. Excuse me, Scott. Hi, I'm Angela. I worked with Nicole. Oh, yeah. Hi. I stopped by the office after the service and gathered some of her things. I thought you might want them. Well, thank you so much. That's very... that's very kind of you. I'm so sorry. I know. I know. Thanks. How's your daughter? She's... she's doing well, actually. The doctor says that she should be home very soon. Good. Well, thanks for bringing this by. I appreciate it. OK. Hang in there. Thanks for coming by. We appreciate all your help. Scott? Yeah. I was looking for you. I just wanted to make sure that you were OK. I'm fine. You know, it was a really beautiful service. Nicole is really going to be missed. It's just a shame that Darla couldn't be there with the family. Well, she, uh, needs time right now to heal. We all do. Hey, maybe we can all go visit her in the hospital later. You know, if you need anything, anything at all, I'll be here. Anna. I loved my wife. I'm going to forget what happened between the two of us. I strongly suggest you do the same. Fine. David? How you holding up, buddy? Huh? You've barely spoken all day. I've spoken. You probably just weren't around. Anna, would you give us a moment? Sure. Is there something on your mind? I was just thinking about third grade. Remember we went on that trip to Yosemite? Yes. I remember your mother making quite a fuss because you had ran off some place. Where did you go? I wanted to see the top of the falls. Yes. You didn't make it too far, as I recall. Mom really let in on me for that. That was quite a scene. We weren't allowed back in a national forest till the early '90s. But you didn't lay into me. David, your mother did a pretty good job for the two of us, wouldn't you say? Maybe you should have. What are you saying? I'm just saying it would have been nice if you had taken control every once in a while, instead of making Mom do it. Hey, I never forced your mother to do anything. You always played the good cop. You should have tried bad cop every once in a while, let Mom off the hook. So I guess I was just sitting here thinking, Mom's gone. Is there anyone left who really cares? David, you know I care about you. You let us break the rules. And you hand out a few extra dividends on our allowance. But it was always Mom who made sure we got to school, studied. I mean, you used to accuse her of not being here for us. You're in the house a lot, but were you really here? Hey. I just wanted to come say goodbye. I'll be heading back to school tonight. Goodbye? I thought you were going to stay for a few more days. Yeah, well, I guess the sooner I get back to a normal life, the better. Well, then. Then I guess we'd better say goodbye now. OK, buddy. You be good. Whoa! We've got a storm coming up. You drive careful, you hear? Thanks, Dad. Call me if you need anything. OK. All right. Hello? Angela? Hey, it's... it's Scott Garrett. I'm sorry to bother you. Hey, Scott. Is everything OK? Yeah, everything is fine. I just found somebody else's stuff mixed in with Nicole's. Do you know a Chris Stewart? Yeah, he used to work in the office. Actually, Nicole took over his old job. Really? Well, you know, I'd love to get his stuff back to him. Would you know how I could get a hold of him? Well, uh, he kind of passed away. Oh, god. Yeah, it was pretty awful. And to make matters worse, his wife came out one day and made a huge scene. It was bad. His wife? Do you know her name? Ann. Ann Stewart. Angela? Hello? Ann? Ow! 9-1-1, can I help you? Yes. My name is Scott Garrett. There's been an emergency at 2994 McCulley Court. Just come right now. Well, she was our housekeeper. I don't... I don't know the whole story. Mm-hmm. So you say this all would have happened around the last few hours? Yeah, it happened tonight. And she would have died about... about when, midnight? Um, I... I've completely lost track of time here, Officer. You're going to come with me, please. My medical examiner tells me this woman has been dead for quite some time. Now, you want to tell me what the hell is really going on here? In other news, prominent lawyer Scott Garrett was arrested last night on suspicion of a double homicide. Detectives found the body of his former maid floating at the bottom of his swimming pool. Garrett insisted that she tried to murder him last evening, even though the time of death was placed several days prior. Due to the inconsistencies in Garrett's story, the DA is now looking in the recent death of Garrett's wife as another possible homicide.
