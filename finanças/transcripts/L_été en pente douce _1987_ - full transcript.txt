- Playing soccer tonight? - I'll be there. Frozen rabbit is on sale at our butcher counter. Hurry before the sale ends. Mr. Juteau, please come to Cash No. 5. 'Bye, Paul. I gotta check your bag. Going through ladies' purses? - 'Bye. - Fane! - Got your receipt? - Not on me. I have to report you. I'll pay you now, then you don't have to bother. Huh, Paul? I'm a soflie. I have to get back to the store, I'm on the night shift. Dickhead! Shawenhick, would you stop that racket? Lilas, put that down right now! Let me go! Asshole, I just had it ﬁxed! You yell at her, I have to break the door down. - Mind your own business! - You make it my business. - You OK, Lilas? - You're so sweet. That's so typical! Why not drain his nuts while you're at it? You're drunk, but don't be rude, Shawenhick. - She costs more than a car. - You'd be nicer to a car. - Women need discipline. - Stop beating the poor girl. The poor girl! That's a good one! If you think you can handle her, she's yours. For a price. Are you nuts? I'll sell her to you for that rabbit, is it yours? Yeah. - Got any beer? - I got a case. Get it, we'll drink a toast. Your woman will cook it. THE SWEET JOYS OF SUMMER You stink, asshole! - We're almost there. - Are you glad I'm here? Yeah, or I wouldn't have asked you to come. I mean in these circumstances, your mother dead and all. Nothing I can do about that. What the hell's this? Isn't the funeral tomorrow? ls that your house? Fane? - She only died yesterday. - It's a real house. Hi, Jeannot. Good to see you, Stéphane. Hello. The American and I were wondering if you'd been told. I had to read about it in the paper. They said the funeral wasn't until tomorrow... It was supposed to be, she died yesterday. - Priest won't work Saturdays. - What? He's a lazy bastard. How'd it happen? Crossed the road without looking, got hit by a truck. She died instantly. Mo saw the whole thing from his window. A truck again? Why are the ladies upset? Mo brought his dog. It's an outrage, your brother... I know! - What's up, Mo? - He'll bite people... Jesus, would you shut up for a minute! Mo, you bastard, it's me. It's me. Not the hospital, Fane. No, brother, you're not going back to the hospital. Yes, Mom said when she died... Shut up and listen to me. Mom's dead, she can't say anything now. She's there, in the coffin. Yeah, she's in the coffin, but she can't talk. I'm saying you're not going back to the hospital. - Really? - Really! Let's go to the funeral now, we're gonna be late. - OK? - They don't want Pilou there. - Who gives a shit? - Yeah, who gives a shit! Settle down. The priest won't let you in with that dog. Pi|ou‘s coming with me, he's God's creature too. If I leave him here, the garage guys will torment him - and throw rocks. - Get a grip, we're late! It'll cause a scene. The dog's coming with me. Then bring your goddamn dog and let's go. The priest will like that! Hurry, we're late! We're here to say a ﬁnal farewell to our sister. It's an old house, way older than the garages. I don't know how old, but it's old. From my father's family. Hear that? When he's sad, he doesn't go to the cemetery, he plays music. - ls he retarded? - No, his brain's screwed up. We were playing in the river and found some old grenades. Mo got it into his head to tinker with it. The grenade blew up in his face. I should have him conﬁned. I'll sell the damn house and we'll take off. I'm gonna write crime novels. God knows I've read enough. I'll buy a typewriter. I've never had a house. Every guy around here wants to jump you. - But you're with me. - Of course, Fane. - ls there a reason? - You're nice. God, I want you! Sorry, I knocked, no one answered. You can't just burst in on people. - I knocked, but... - We didn't hear over the music. Sorry. I'm Mr. Laval, the notary. I wanted to come and give you my heartfelt condolences. That's why you came here? - Want a drink? - No, thanks. I don't like to drink too much in this heat. Strange QLIY- I drink more in this heat than when it's 20 below. Stop by my office to handle the details of the will. The will? We have to sort out the paperwork. You and your brother are the sole inheritors of the house. We need to know if you're selling or taking possession. I think the owners of the Voke Garage would be interested. And we need to discuss your brother's future. I won't sell. If you should decide to, there are legal formalities. Get this through your head: I'm staying here and taking care of my brother. Tell that to those Voke bastards. I won't sell them the house so they can knock it down. I'll come see you about the "legal formalities." Good-bye! Parasites! Rats! Vultures! Let them try to get me out! I'm here to stay! The house belongs to you, me and that idiot staring at me. They can't get us here. We'll do as you say. I'm happy to be with you. Well? Well what? - Any trouble? - What kind? There was hardly anyone besides the two brothers. Did you check out the retard? Pathetic! Are they back yet? - Didja see the girl with Fane? - He has a girl? That's just it. Where did she come from? How did he get her? It's beyond me. How could he get a girl like that? Must be a hooker. I'll ﬂush those animals out. Hey, Mo! It's hot as hell! - Want a drink? - No. He never drinks. He thinks drinking‘s a deadly sin. My mom pounded it into his silly head and it stuck. Mo's never committed a sin, except maybe jerking off. Right? Kids play on the highway and get run over or play with grenades. This is what happens to them. Scarred faces and empty heads. Why do people have kids? I want kids. - Bullshit. - All women want kids. They'll ride their bikes on the highway and play with grenades! You tell the little bastards not to, but they do. They go ahead and get run over by a transport truck, just to piss us off. - The eggs are burning. - Don't change the subject! Mo, let's eat! Mo, wanna go to the hospital? Not the hospital, Fane. Then make yourself useful. Lilas and I won't wait on you. Stop faking it! - Don't yell at him. - I'm explaining things to him. Get it, Mo? One of us has to ﬁgure things out. The laundry. I'll do the laundry. They don't feed us at the hospital. Good, the laundry. - And I'll cook. - You'll cook. I'll do the dishes, the housework and the gardening. That's right. I'll iron, wash, scrub, take out the garbage and get the milk. Start taking care of yourself. I'll ﬁgure it out, Fane. I'll show you. - That's nice of you. - She's a really nice chick. The 3 of us will get by just ﬁne. Let's eat. - We'll live on our pensions. - Exactly! We should get married. Otherwise, people will talk. People can be so mean. I know these women, I can blow them off. Marry me or I'm leaving. I don't want to go into a store and hear, "There's Stéphane Leheurt's slut." You tell them to go screw themselves! I'll beat 'em up! That won't stop people's nasty comments. I want to know who the chick is. We could knock down the house and make a used-car lot. Connect the two buildings. We could do whatever, put up a wall... He won't sell. I couldn't very well ﬁght with the old lady. But I waited patiently till she was dead and now she is. Don't talk about an old lady like that. Lilas! Wait! Slow down, Lilas! Shit! Fane! Oh my God! Don't be scared. Do I scare you? Don't be embarrassed. I should be. We drank too much last night because of this heat. It's hot. I can't stand the heat, it makes me sweat. I'm all damp. Don't worry, I'm Fane's woman. All women are made the same. I'm sure. All men too. It's OK, it's natural. Yeah. Never mind, I'm like all other women. You're nothing like them. I'm like them. You're sweet. I'll show you how to make coffee. Yes! I didn't know what to do. There was a bug on your leg and I didn't know what to do. I really didn't know. Don't talk, let me teach you how to make coffee. Where's the coffee? This heat is unbearable. We have a lot to do. Today. - Your deposit, Mr. Leheurt. - Great, Mr. Bassof. I was a little short and I have to work some things out. - How can I thank you? - You have. 'Bye, Mr. Dujet. A last one for the road? - On the day I robbed the till? - Fane! You're right, one last time. - You'll pay me tomorrow. - No, I won't. Dickhead! Sit down and I'll show you something. Look! Look familiar? No. It's Marilyn Monroe, an American actress. She's made tons of movies. - Do you have a TV? - No. Never seen TV? At the farm where I buy milk, I sometimes take a look. They say, "We're busy, you have to leave." They don't like me watching their TV. Does she remind you of anyone? I don't know. My hair and makeup aren't done. Now I'll show you how to do the dishes. Mr. Roger, it's me! It's me. - He's back. - How're you doing? I'm taking off. I have a house now. I told them at the store to screw themselves. I made them pay me what they owed me. You're moving to the middle of nowhere? 2000 people live there. in tourist season, it's crawling with idiots in shorts. Middle of nowhere? What's wrong, Maurice? Why are you crying? Mommy's gone, they're all mean out there and I don't want to go to the hospital. Mommy and Auntie are both gone. Don't cry. Fane won't let you go to the hospital. We'll be ﬁne here, the 3 of us. You did a good job, I watched you. Be nice and stop crying. Yeah. - Good, we'll drink to that. - Yeah. This is all I found. That was for Sundays or when people came over. - Did many people come over? - Never! She didn't leave much. Just this. Christ, take a look at this. Ever seen her in this? With this on, it was like she was more than naked. See what I mean? Sluts wear stuff that makes them look better than naked. It just clung to her. She'd walk around with her tits spilling out of her bra. She got everyone hard. - Should've seen it. - Yeah. Let's have a drink. To that slut and to your house! - Lucky bastard! - Don't call her a slut. No offence meant. She's yours. But she's a total slut, she'll go with anyone. ls that why you hit her? No, she bugged me with all that marriage shit. - Has she proposed yet? - No. She's had a rough time. - It's very nice. - It's my room. Come over here! Come closer. - Here's Flippo. - Who's that? Flippo! He's funny. - Thirsty? - I get excited when I drink. I can't drink much, not like Fane. It reminds me of my room when I was little. Were you mean when you were little? - How silly! - It's just that kids are mean. When Fane and I were kids, I was mean too. I didn't listen to my mommy, so God punished me. His face is all scarred because of me. God punished me and I stayed a kid. A mean, good-for-nothing kid. But I kept growing and the other kids were mean to me. They'd kick me, especially one of them, but I couldn't say anything, his dad was a cop. They'd throw stones at Pilou. Everyone out there is mean. All because I hurt my little brother. I was supposed to take care of him. They cut out a part of my brain. I'm bad because I'm missing parts in my head. People can be nasty with their brains intact. I had a room just like this. - Then... - Fane was mean too. It's not his fault, he's good-for-nothing. I'm good-for-nothing too. Kids aren't like that. Kids aren't mean in the least. Fane could give me a kid. We'll get married, then we'll all be here with the kid. My kid will be really, really nice. And I'll take care of her. That's what I want, a little girl just like me. Fane doesn't want that. - He doesn't. - Know how babies are made? Tell me. Don't do that. Don't be embarrassed, it's natural. Remember this morning? We're not to be embarrassed. I know they come from their mothers' stomachs. How do they get there? From God. Fine, Mo. What if God wanted me to have a kid? Fane would be mad. He hates God, he's good-for-nothing. You're so sweet! I'd like to make you happy. Did you like seeing me naked this morning? Don't start that! Look at me, don't be embarrassed. Do you think I'm pretty? Don't be embarrassed, you're so sweet. I like you. You're both a man and a child, do you see? I'd like to make you happy. Look. I'll show you how to get intense pleasure. No one ever taught you that. It'll be our secret, OK? It's natural, everyone does it. Don't be embarrassed. It'll be our secret, OK? Touch me, Mo. Touch me all over, it feels so good. Wait. You look snazzy. - It's time! - Time? Time to get the milk, it's my job. Pilou! There are always kids waiting for me. They shout mean things and try to torment Pilou. They chant, "Mo is for moron!" - Especially in summer vacation. - Just ignore them. No, one day I'll catch one and smash his head! If you come with me, the kids won't dare make fun. - Think so? - I know so. All right, then. - I wanted to tell you... - Don't! It's our secret, remember. It's our secret, it's natural. Yeah, it's natural. Can we be natural again? Here's the bookstore where I bought Mom's newspapers. The lady would write down the price, and sometimes I'd get candy. Pilou! That's Mr. Foire‘s grocery store. He's so nice. He says, "How's it going, Mo?" I say, "Fine, Mr. Foire, and you?" He says, "I'm sure it'd go if I tried," and laughs. - How's it going, Mo? - Fine, Mr. Foire, and you? I'm sure it'd go if I tried. Pilou! Right this way! - Out of the way, jerkoff! - Stop it, Mo! - Right this way! - Stop it! They're nice when you're with me. Right, but stop getting excited. They'll think you're crazy and give you trouble. Are you mad? No. The hot sun's hurting my head, that's all. Now go get that milk. Hello. You're looking ﬁne. I saw his act back there. Does it bother you? Not particularly. My name's André Voke. - Have you heard of me? - I'm not from here. - You might be soon. - What do you know? Hi, Mo! Pretty nice girl! Don't talk to her! I'm meeting my neighbor. . My pretty neighbor. - Lilas. That's wonderful. It's a name that... I heard you're Fane's girl. - Then you know. - It's a small village. For example, you two go shopping together. Everyone will know within an hour. What do you want? Do you always wear glasses? Yes. Let's not play dumb. I want to know what you're getting out of this, but not here and not now. Who asked you? I'm marrying Fane, so what if you think he's no good? He has a house, and he's going to write books. We'll be married and we'll keep Mo with us. Fane in the French Academy? Leave her alone! Get lost, Mo. Leave her alone! My car! Listen, cutie. Don't call me that! Don't call her that. I've got a thing or two to explain to you. Tomorrow's Sunday, I'll be having a drink outside the church, enough said? Get your car out of here. You annoy me, you big fat loser! The big fat loser's gonna smash your head in! Let's go home. He should leave you alone and I'm not a big fat loser. - Of course not. - He's the big fat loser. Don't talk to him. - He owns the garage? - Yeah, the big fat loser. Let's just drop it and go home, OK? - Still have a headache? - A headache? - From the sun. - Doesn't hurt anymore. I asked for aspirin at Mr. Laubier‘s farm. I told him I had a headache. They're for you. - Watch out for the wasps. - The wasps? If you step on their nests, they get mad and sting. One time I got stung 17 times. My head, my arms, everywhere. Some people die after one sting, I'm still alive. I was swollen all over, but still alive. Where were you? Right. - There was no one here. - Why's he here? See how she treats me? You saw, I didn't say a thing and she treats me like that. Get off it, Shawenhick. I went to get your stuff and Claude wanted to see my house. He's having a good-bye dinner with us. Have a drink. - He won't bug you at a party. - Why would l? - Does he want some? - No. - He's my brother. - That's hard to believe. I bought something. - Right, Claude? - Yeah. Come look. - What is it? - Isn't it nice? - They had electric ones. - What is it? It's very nice. - What is it? - We'll look inside. - Let me. - Don't touch! Touch this typewriter, I'll rip you apart. It's mine, and nobody lays a ﬁnger on it. - It's my work tool. - You can't even open it. Just takes getting used to. Look, there are two buttons and one that locks it. Press and lift off. - I took a one-year course. - What is it? Wait a minute. Lilas, no one touches it. Stand back. Did you see that? - Capitals? - Here. And this moves the carriage. It just takes getting used to. Anything you do takes time to learn. You've got your work cut out for you. The ﬁrst chapter‘|| take 10 years. Screw you! I'll get used to it. Lilas will help. I could dictate. Don't touch, for chrissakes! It cost 40,000 francs. You'd just wreck it. It's not a toy. It's not for kids. I didn't do anything! You were just about to pounce on it and wreck it. We saw Dédé Voke and he talked to us. - So what? - He wants to buy the house. He was just asking. About the house. He just asked some questions, but Mo sent him packing. - Yeah. - But you didn't! - What's that mean? - You want his money? Don't talk to that twerp, or I'll get mad. I'll kill his ass! He wanted to know if I was with you. He said people around here will talk. I bought this typewriter to work in peace. I'm working on something. I don't need you playing games with me. Lilas didn't do anything. It's not her fault. - It was Voke, don't yell. - Stay the hell out of it. - Don't yell at her. - This is my house. Don't yell at her! Leave me alone, Claude. Be nice, what did I do? I still have bruises from what you did. Leave me alone. You're drunk, and you just want to mess things up. I was invited by that loser knocking himself out typing. I'm not messing things up. What's it like screwing morons? Back off, jerk! Lilas, I'm not that drunk, I'm thinking clearly. You're a wonderful girl, maybe even the one for me. I shouldn't have given you up. Every time I close my eyes I see your tits and your ass in that red bathing suit. All I see is your ass in that red bathing suit. Stop or I'll call Fane! Leave me alone, crude bastard! I want you back, but my place is a dump. You could manage to get Fane to marry you. After 6 months... What? Jesus, Fane! What's wrong? Get lost! C‘mon, beat it! ls this a joke? I invited you over, I helped you move and you're throwing me out? You're just here for the evening. You chase after Lilas, plotting to scam me? What's the problem? I'm your friend, she's the slut. She'll suck you dry, and not how you think. Get lost. Mo! Throw him out! Rip him apart! I'll show you! Get him out! - Stop it! - Get out! Let him go. Let him go! That's done. - I knew it, cutie. - Show some respect. That's how I am. I'm friendly with people I like, and I like you. I thought I would and now I know. What do you want? I don't know why I got in. Because you want to hear what I have to tell you. Here's the situation with me, my brother and the house. Fane won't sell. What do you need the house for? To join the two garages together and make a parking lot. We need a used-car lot here. We'd also start up a restaurant for tourists and truckers. Fast-food crap at high prices. Motorists will eat any old garbage without complaining. It'll work, I know what I'm talking about. Why tell me that? It hurts me to think of you with Fane. A girl like you. I'll get you out of a bad situation. With me, it'll be a bonanza. You're the hottest babe I've ever seen. The things I'd do to you... Know what‘|| happen with Fane? - He'll marry me, he said so. - Marry you? It'll work, I know what I'm talking about. Married or not, people won't stand for a girl like you living with two men, one of them a moron. People care about these things. They're talking about how you're in it for the money. I have a better offer: Manager in the snack bar I'm opening. You'd be in charge of staff and work the cash. With a share of the proﬁts. You won't get his house! With tits like that, you could make a man do anything. You could work on him and make him sell. - I'd give you a share. - And an apron? Some bonanza! - You're the bonanza. - Men are all the same! My dad used to tell me my body would get me places. I got places, but now I have a house. Fane will marry me and we'll have kids. Fane will leave you all in the dust. - Don't get mad. - Hands off, dirty bastard! Or I'll dent your car. I'm sick of you all and your filthy, groping hands! That's all you want! Are you all nuts? Are you married? You don't care. You pick me up and offer me a waitress job and a quick screw. You're a bastard! Throw that rock down. Damn, my hood! Goddammit! Here you are! Yeah, I'm here, what do you want? He's scared of guns and uniforms. How are you, Maurice? Get in a car accident last night? What, did you drink too much pastis? I was here, I didn't have an accident. My car! Where's my car? I'll never get it out alone. Can you tow me, the two of you? He's almost retired. Ask for Voke‘s tow truck. He has it in for me, I don't talk to him. You need a tow truck. Anyone with a rope and a car can get me out. - Legally, you need a tow truck. - It's Sunday today! Don't push it, we were nice enough to bring you here. Figure it out, you can't leave it on the shoulder. Hi, Olivier. - Why are you here? - You work Sundays? Quite the garage. - Yeah, quite the garage. - Christ, it stinks like gas! - Don't you get a headache? - I have a headache. I did an oil change, that's why it stinks. It really stinks. Don't smoke here. I can never get used to this heat. Who says I am? ls that why you're here? - I'm busy. - I need your help. For what? My car's in the ditch, I need a tow truck. How'd it get there? I've never had an accident. My friend stole my car. I see. Must be a nice guy, your friend. If I see him, I'll rip him apart. - What's he doing here? - Watch it! - About time you show up. - What's it to you? I'm here knocking myself out every Sunday, while you... What are you doing in my garage? He needs the tow truck. - Guy put his car in the ditch. - It's true. What? He needs what? The tow truck. Go to hell! The cops told me to come here. You're drunk. I don't deserve this kind of treatment. - Go to hell! - Don't say that. You can't treat customers like that. You're not a customer, you're a shit. Your brother and your whore too. And everything in your house. - Are you ﬁnished? - It's true! We don't work Sundays. The tow truck's broken. Leave your junk heap where it is. The cops told me to come here. I'll press charges against you. They'll take that hooker in. Look what she did. First the retard pounds on my roof, then the slut smashes my hood. It's a new car! Why did Lilas dent your car? Because she's a slut. It's not true. Beat it! Go back to your shit. Get the hell out of here! Beat it! More nature? No, Mo. Go there now. Apologize, make peace. It's well worth it. Apologize? Think of the advantages. I'll go tomorrow. In a while. Now, or you'll never go. I've only had that car for 2 months. Poor Mo! Anyone home? Bastard! Can I go next? - Don't touch me! - I'll do what I want. Get lost, big fat loser! Put your dick away and let me talk to the lady. You got yours. Tell him to sell the house. You can convince him. if you don't, I'll give him something for his novel. You shut your mouth. Touch me again and you go back to the hospital. Do as I say, bitch. Apologize to my wife. Apologize to your wife? Will your brother apologize for screwing the slut? Don't call her that, we're getting married. Apologize, you're in my house. I'm telling you for your own good. She's a slut. Don't call her that. Say, "I'm sorry, Mrs. Leheurt." You're in my house. I'm sorry, Mrs. Leheurt. We're getting married? "Rose was a nice girl. She looked like Marie-Line Monroe. "She wanted kids, but her husband didn't. "They adopted one, Maurice, who was a man, but sick." Yes! Pilou! Fane, I can do it! It's all ready, cigarettes and everything. - Don't yell, go make coffee. - It's all ready! Cigarettes too! I'm not going to the hospital, right? Of course not, you're staying here with us. The coffee's good. Cold, but good. I put you in my novel, are you happy? I'll read it to you. You touched my typewriter! I'll put you in the hospital! Stop sulking! It wasn't me! Not the hospital! "Rose made a huge mistake. "To keep her son out of the hospital and her husband "from shame, she went far away." It wasn't you, brother. - Will you make coffee? - Yes. - Where to? - Villeneuve. Good. It's ﬁne. My car's better than this heap. Sorry. I was here ﬁrst. You wasted my time, bitch! We're opening a cafe on the ground ﬂoor. We just need tables, chairs, a counter and a sign: - Café Leheurt. - What‘l| people say, - after what happened? - Nothing happened. They'll mind their own business and we'll live quietly here. - We'll get married. - Really? Like I said. We'll have a big party. In honor of Mrs. Leheurt and her café. We'll invite everyone, except the Vokes. Bring out the Sunday bottle. - It's not Sunday. - We'll pretend. How's your novel going? I'm putting everything in it: you, me, Mo and the cafe. - Even those Voke assholes. - It'll be a strange book. I know what I'm doing. People like a happy ending. Goddamn heat! Lilas! Why are you waiting out here? I've been expecting you. - Yeah? - Come in. Sit down, Fane. As I told you, I want to open a café-restaurant. How much do you need? I need a counter, 7 tables, 30 chairs, a coffee machine, paint and a sign. I'll give you a loan. 120,000 francs enough? Yeah, that'd be great. What's your collateral? I promise I'll pay you back. I know, but I'll need something concrete. I have my brother's and mother's savings accounts. Let's see. It's not enough. You'll have to give your house as collateral. I prefer the savings accounts. Then I can't lend you the money. All right, Mr. Brassouls. I'll think about it. Listen... It's none of my business, but is it true what they say about the girl you brought here? You're right, it's none of your business. Done? Mo! Show us your waitering skills, we're thirsty. Let's have some fun. Yes, ladies and gentlemen? There are no ladies here! ls the American a lady? Gentlemen? 2 brews. 2 beers! 2 beers! Where's your tray? Never mind. It's OK, sit down. ls this yours? Don't touch that, Fane will get mad. Let's see. It's not your size. It's not his size! Don't touch, it's Li|as‘s, Fane will get mad. It's Li|as‘s? Fane won't mind. I heard he likes to share. Right, Mo? Are you screwing her? You're big fat losers. Hey, guys! - Almost done? - Almost. We're taking a break in this heat. Good idea. Me too. It's killing me. Mo, bring us some beer! We bought her wedding dress. The whole village will be blown away. - Show them. - Not before my wedding day. Come on, Lilas, just for us. No, it's bad luck. You'll be happy with your wife. My brother too. It's a good business. In a year, maybe I'll expand and open a hotel. Maybe even buy the Vokes‘ garage. It might happen, Jeannot. Thanks, Mo. Invite your cousin from Paris to the wedding. - That's a lot of people. - Everyone except the Vokes. A beautiful wedding for a beautiful chick. Will you be my witness? - Me? - Who else, dickhead? I'd be honored to. - He'll never pay it. - He gave me collateral. You'll lose out. He made the loan with your money. You put your money in the credit union and they give it to a drunk who won't pay it back. Get off our backs, all you want is the old lady's house. Of course I do, I don't want a stranger to buy it. This thing‘|| cost us. When you go ask for a tractor loan they'll say, "Sorry, Mr. Fane Leheurt drank it away." I'm closing my account. Ladies and gentlemen. 2 beers! Ask them what he and his slut are planning. - He wants to open a hotel. - What did I tell you? A brothel here where you live, where your kids live. We're all invited to the wedding except you. He asked me to be his witness. He has fun and we pay. Is that what the loan's for? Know what kind of a tease she is? She wiggles around hanging her underwear. If I'd wanted to... One thing's for sure: Everyone in this cafe will go to the brothel. Hello! I'm here for two things: One, I'm marrying Stéphane Leheurt. You're all invited. Looking for something, cutie? Why "cutie"? You use that on girls you can't screw? Must use it a lot. Two, someone here thinks stealing ladies' underwear makes him a man. Right? Some lady! I saw this slut screwing the retard. Why not just jerk off? Don't know how? And you want to screw me? Look at him! When you can't screw your wife, think of me. Yes! Pilou! I'm ready! Well I'm not! You look nice! Damn, Mo, you've never looked better! I'm glad you're my brother. I'm proud of you. Wait a minute. I'm ready! Christ, Lilas, you look like Marilyn Monroe! - Pilou! - They're already inside. You're late! I said 2:30 and it's 3! I have 4 other weddings to do! Sorry, Father, are they all here? No one's here. - Where are the witnesses? - No one's here? - Mo's here. - I need 2 witnesses. They'll be here. I can't wait, I have to get to Villeneuve. - You could be a witness. - I'm the priest, I do enough. - We'll marry at city hall. - You still need witnesses. - Did you get the time right? - Yes! It can't be! They must have thought the opening was ﬁrst. - I'm sure they're at the cafe. - Clever! I won't stand for this. Believe me. Dammit! It cost us 2 savings accounts. They can't do this to me. Hi, I'm just stopping by- I'd like to congratulate you. - We couldn't get married. - Really? No one showed up. Give Mr. Laval a sandwich. It's sad, a wedding without any people. Like a café with no customers. After what's happened, I'd advise you to sell right away. They won't come and you'll go bankrupt! Your house will be sold at auction. Better to sell now. Leave him alone, there's no point. Get lost, or I'll kick your ass! Looks like you have a visitor, Voke. Yeah, looks like it. She didn't invite you to the wedding, only the honeymoon! It's not your car. - Waiting for someone? - Sit down, we need to talk. We'll talk outside. I said, sit down. I'm warning you, if you do more damage... I'm leaving Fane. I knew this would happen. You want to know if my offer's still good, I'm glad. Yeah, I came to see that shithead Voke and screw him. But not how he thinks. Now that I'm leaving, the café will work out. You won't get the house and you won't get me. Ever! You've lost! Lilas! I'll give you 50% of the snack bar. - Make him sell. - I want it all. I want to get married and have the house. You'll get it all, I'll get a divorce. You'll be the boss. I love you. How touching. Except I love Fane and no one could love you. A beer, boss! Boss, a beer! I'll rip you all apart! You won't get away with it! I'll rip you all apart! Bunch of dickheads! The heat's making us all crazy. Everything's fine now, you'll be here with your brother. I'll have a pastis. - A pastis. -Two - A beer. - A beer. - A Ricard. - With mint. Damn, it's gonna work out. - Pastis, beer... - A shot. Fane, Li|as‘s leaving! On the bus, with her suitcase! Ladies and gentlemen. She was getting on the bus. I brought her here and spilled the milk. - Where are you going? - She's leaving. It's best for everyone. Mo, pack your bag. We're all leaving. Put the milk down, that's over now. The café‘s for sale. The house too, right now. - Give me a price. - I didn't expect this. How much you got on you? - Let's negotiate. - Empty your pockets. You get the house for 524 francs. It's a deal. I'll buy your house for 3 million right now. I'm not selling to you. 524 francs... ...and your nice, red car. It's a negotiated deal. Agreed? Agreed. I should tell you my vanity mirror's broken. Buy a round to celebrate. It's my round. Pack the car, we have some business. Come here, brother. Pilou! Yes! What is it? What is it? Yes! One! Two! Three! Fouﬂ Are you OK, Lilas? It's natural! Pilou! Translation: Julie McPhail TV5 Québec Canada
