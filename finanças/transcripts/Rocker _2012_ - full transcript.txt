Excuse me. Can I interest you in some skis? - No. I don't ski. - Maybe for the lady? No thanks. Why not have a look? They're brand new. I'm not interested. Got it? - I'm selling them cheap! - Let me past. - Just one look! - I'm not interested! Excuse me. Can I interest you in some skis? - No thanks. - They're cheap! I've already got some. - For just 150. - Don't you understand? I don't want them! - Just have a look! - Get lost! - For 100... - Enough! O Lord God, deliver us from this misfortune... and deliver Florin... from this curse... and lead him in the right path... may he be good, and level-headed... and Lord rest his mother's soul... and grant us health... so we can do everything we must... And Lord forgive me, the worst of sinners. Lord help us. Come on, it'll get cold. We're not eating now. Hey. It's me. I'm here - I can't find the ball. I'll bring it. Don't I always? So you'll drop by... Ok. Bye. Victor, don't go wandering off! Where to?!? The Earth is round, you know. And it also spins! It spins fast! That's right! Over. Up a bit. Up a bit. What's with that face, Victor? I live an artist's life... "Sleep all day, up all night"! That's about right. Up a bit. A bit more. Ok. Sorry to bother you, can I interest you in some skis? No. They're brand new. I'm letting them go cheap! 100 Lei. Not a scratch on them. Bindings too. No. Want to buy some skis? Excuse me miss, would you like to buy some skis? No thanks. They're going cheap. Bindings included. Made in Germany. Not a scratch. Brand new. Are you sure you don't want them? - I'll let you have them cheap! - No. - Mummy, did you bring me anything? - What are you doing outside? Hello, Alex. - Alex? Want Victor to stay? - No! I want him to go. - Bye. - Bye. Bye Alex! Florin? Florin. Florin. What's that bullshit? You can't see a thing. What do you mean, son? I mostly filmed you... Can't you see? It looks like a wedding video. There's Paul too, see? Look at it, it's shaky. If you don't like it, don't use it. OK? We can't use it. We discussed this with Camelia, we need to add those effects. It should have been on a tripod or something... Have you forgotten what we agreed with her? Yes, but we'll film some more when she gets here, we'll film in Bucharest, too... We're not filming anything in Bucharest. It'll be too late... - The video should have been ready by then. - It'll be ready. My arse will it be ready! Look! Look! - Let's see. - Look, I'm focusing on you. Congratulations, Daddy! It's terrible. Congratulations. I was just trying to help. Film it yourself. Turn that crap off. - You do it. - You do it. What's up, Victor? Ok. - Where's Fang? - Still in bed. - Coffee? - No thanks. - Let's recap. - OK. So... Tony... He's paid. Fang. 1700, right? And the 150 from Tuesday. Right? And another 150 on Wednesday. - 200 on Thursday. - Yeah. And you gave me 200 on Thursday. - So how much is left? - 1800. Let's tot it up again. - 2000. - Right. There you go. What are we going to do about it, Victor? You'll never pay it off like this. Did you sell that car? Want me to sell it for you? No, I'll do it. Hurry up, then... Sell it cheaper or something. But be quick about it. Want to do some dealing? Push it to those rockers of yours. Give them some stuff, get them started. We can work together. What do you say? Me? A dealer? We bend over backwards for you but you don't give a shit about us? Don't you think I'd like to be served in bed... It's not like that, Cristi. No? Then why are you buying from Tibi? Don't you think we talk among ourselves? - I only buy from you! - Do you think we're stupid? I don't know... maybe Fang bought from him, not me. Did you watch the CFR match? Pathetic. It's no wonder we never get to the European Final. We're fucked... What's up, waster? I'm OK, stupid. You? I wanted to kill myself, but you kept disturbing me... Is it payday or what? I was telling your dad how things stand. We're not a bank and we don't pay VAT. He knows that, he's not stupid for nothing. - I'm off. - Leave us a bit more stuff, can you? I can't. I told your dad. No more on credit. You're a fucking junkie. And you're a rocker with no money for drugs. - Suck my dick. - You suck my dick. Cristi. I can give you 300, now. No. Come and talk to them. - I can give you 300, now. - No. Take it to them. Bye. What did he want? Any stuff left around the house? Is there? It's only 3 o'clock. I know what time it is. So we wait, right? You know what time's like? Like what? Like toothpaste. You can't put it back in the tube. Irreversible. You can't change anything. - No shit. - Yeah. Want to watch me die? Great! So you want to get rid of me! What the fuck! Playing the waiting game! As long as we're waiting, do something useful! Wash some clothes! Clean the place up! - I'll just have to help myself... - Hands off my jacket. Hands off my jacket. I can't believe this fucking wait! Another 10 seconds, another 10 seconds... 3... 2... 1 It's half past 3! Come on, Daddy! It's time for din-dins, Daddy! The body's nothing, you know? Nothing but an empty box. A box for putting food and drink in. Different boxes... Where do you think I get the money from? Think it grows on trees? Money, money. All day long... And that Cristi... He comes and goes as he pleases. Good, is it? Is it from Tibi? The continents are moving. Did you know that? We sit here and they... They're moving. You can't tell. In the beginning there was just one. One big one. I had a dream about Obama. He was at the club... at the Abyss... He was wearing... one of those... cowboy hats. An eye for an eye... and a tooth... for Fang. That doesn't work. He was talking Korean... I couldn't understand a word. You know what song he was singing? 'Territory.' Yeah. If the Nutella's run out... No, don't bother. Get some cigarettes. Yes. You know what? Make some sandwiches. Yes. Anything. Whatever you've got in the fridge. Yeah, maybe the boys will be hungry. Yes. Yes. Cigarettes, yes. Ok. Shall we get going, Florin? Get it? I haven't picked up a guitar for ages, but something like that. They don't play like that anymore, Santana. That's real rock! - Rock evolves too, right? - Evolves my arse! Come on! If the words were in English, it'd be better. Never mind English. I told you, I'll translate the words, and if you like it... We're not doing it in English. All the bands that sing in English get on the radio... Let the English sing in English! We should give it a try, and if it doesn't work... That's enough with your English! Come on. From 'imoral'... Fuck that phone! I told you not to film the fucking rehearsals. Yeah, you said. What the fuck! Filming on a mobile phone and going on about singing in English... Let's take it from the top. Fuck it. Take it from 'Și când tu vezi'. What about the posters? Who's printing them? I spoke to that guy, Hefe. He said he'd sort it out. How many is he printing? If he's just printing two... Two? He'll print as many as necessary. What about the hotel? - We'll arrange something. - They should arrange it. We'll see when we get there. We'll probably end up sleeping in the train station again. Give me that. Thanks. Here they are, boss. They're brand new. Not a scratch... Where did you get them? My son's girlfriend wants to sell them. She got a new pair. I don't know, my wife doesn't really ski. Buy them and she can learn... With bindings, too. - How much? - 200. In the shops they're 500 to 600. I don't know. Let's speak some other time. I'll call you. Bye. Bye. Who did you sell them to? Richie? - What does it matter who bought them? - It matters. The Paiste would have been just perfect. I'm sure you sold them to Richie. Want the set? No, I'll buy just this one. Are you still going to play in Bucharest? Yes. I'd like to see Richie make it in Bucharest... Orange? They're for women. Buy them for your wife. They're cheap! Only 250. They're 500 in the shops. - Made in Germany! - We don't really ski. - Look at the great bindings! - Where did you get them? - What's with those? - I found them. - Where? - In the forest. - What are these? - Skis. - He found them in the forest. - Really? - Bye. - Give me 50 now... - I don't need them. Bye. - Bye. - Look! - Go! - Switch weapon. - Ok. Not that one... The other one! Go! Who's shooting at you? Someone's getting you... Wait! There he is... - Spotted him! - You're wounded! Run! - Victor? - Run... Yes? Can you come and help me? Come on! What do you want? Money? OK, there you go. You too! - Want some gloves? - No need. Tell me if I need to hold my hair back. Just a second... Is it OK like this? It's OK. Hold it back... that's it. I've tried to hold it like this, but... OK... You got some on you... Oops! Come on. Hold it up. Like that. You're good at it! - Think so? - Really! Great! What's up, rocker? Hi, Cristi. Hi, Tibi. Hi. I brought them. Sorry I'm late. He owes 2000. He buys from us, pays Tibi and so on... He's a real fucking smart-arse. Here's 300... A part of it... Take the money, Cristi. Just a part of it. What do you think this is, a TV serial? In episodes? Go to the doctor if you want it on prescription. Show them your rock moves... The ones you showed me. - What moves? - You know, your rock moves... Let's give them a bit of a laugh. I'm not in the mood. What the fuck? Show them your rock moves. - I'm not in the mood, Cristi. - Come on. - Have you seen him when he goes wild? - What does he do? He goes wild! Just wait and see. He'll do it now... You did well at school, didn't you? Not as well as I did at cards. Come on rocker, you're my man. Wait a second... Here. Thanks Cristi. - When I've got the money, I'll bring it. - Alright. I always do. - When I've got it, I bring it. - Right... What's up, son? Guess... I didn't get the Paiste. I got Meinl. They're also made in Germany. Why didn't you get the Paiste? Richie must have bought them. He heard we needed them and got hold of them quick. Give me a look. I'm sick of this prison regime. Tell me, can get it for me? If not, I'll get it myself. - Come on, son, it's not like that. - What do you mean? I trust you... I'm climbing up the fucking walls... Do you expect me to do everything? You know what? Go and chase after Cristi yourself, OK? I have to write the fucking lyrics. I'm crawling up the walls and you leave me waiting for hours. That's your plan. To be late, right? Calm down. I don't want to calm down. Who writes the lyrics? Who composes the music? You? What do you mean? You buy cymbals for other people, like an idiot. Not for others. For us, for the band. We've got a concert, right? So why don't you buy that microphone for me? I'll get it... So you spare a thought for me too. You fucking altruist. I told you, you can be whatever you like. Altruist, anarchist, pacifist... But let me live my fucking life! Let me live! - I don't let you live? - Yes, you! You're the one who won't let me live this fucking life! You're playing the dealer with me... The big dealer. The police are after you... You're in trouble with the mafia... Just like in the movies... We live in fucking Oradea! You come home late. You set my fucking timetable, like I'm having my period... Doctor Mengele! Leave the money on the fridge and I'll manage. OK? Mind your own business. They had boulders with prop numbers on them, all laid out nicely, the desert was raked smooth, not a star in the sky. Just like on the moon, man! It was all staged, definitely... It wasn't staged. I saw it with my own eyes. I watched it live on TV, I'm not joking! Surely you can't believe it. Why not? Did they have a TV cable running from Earth to the Moon? There are so many regions on Earth that are wilderness... nobody lives there... Siberia, Russia, Canada... Who would want to live there? - I would! - It's minus 40 degrees out there... Body temperature is 36 degrees. So the difference is... You take some vodka with you. You take vodka with you... That's an idea! I think anarchy is the only solution. The only law is that there is no law! So let chaos sort everything out. - Yeah. - You're getting them mixed up. - How? - Chaos has nothing to do with anarchy. Anarchy is a great idea, that only politicians today really understand... - And the TV stations... - Everything has happened before! History repeats itself over and over... It's like that theory... History repeats itself... What star sign are you? - What? - What star sign are you? You know that song? 'History repeating'... Your star sign doesn't matter. After the age of 30, it's your ascendant that matters. Never mind the ascendant. Camelia's right. Don't tap ash on the floor. The ashtray is over there! Camelia's absolutely right. History repeats itself... We think we're the only ones who suffer, who have problems... that we're the most important... Nothing new has been invented since the Greeks anyway. It's all an illusion! Everything! We're here, our thoughts are elsewhere... so we're not here... Doesn't it sound good? It sounds great! Daddy, you're great... I love you, I love you... You're great. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! What happened? Didn't I ask you to stand still?! Listen to Camelia! Well, I'm filming and trying not to move... Stop moving! The frame mustn't move, so we can add the animal heads later... Don't you get it? I'll stand still. I'll film all the close-ups, OK? You film them. Why have we got two cameras, then? To get more shots, right? So, Fang, do you want just one shot or more? One single shot. A single shot. It's a protest against MTV. A single shot, like in those new Romanian films... ...Noul Val, Nouvelle Vague... ...New Wave, New York... I won't stop filming, and I'll start with the cymbal here, And we could do with some dry ice... A rock video without smoke looks strange... No. No, no. Stop it. Listen to Camelia. - Like we agreed. - Yes, like we agreed. Why have we got two cameras, then? Do like she says! Ok, let's start again. Come over here, please. - Go and hold the camera over there... - And keep it still... Keep it still... it has to be still... so we can key the image... - Is here OK? - Put the camera down. Ready? Rolling! Action! It's music, you can't set a value on it... It has the same value, the same quantity... You're right. If you have an MP3 here and you make 5 copies, you'll have 5 new MP3s, all identical with the first one? - Like a clone... - Exactly, like a clone. No information gets lost... So it's not stealing. That's not counterfeiting... - Yeah, you're right... - It's all a big scam... - Bye. Think about that solo, OK? - Yeah, yeah. See you later. - Well, we're off. - Take care. We'll talk later... I don't know about the next rehearsal... Call Paul and see when he's free, OK? - We'll talk later. - Bye. Get out. Let me drive. Why? I want to take Camelia somewhere, to talk about the video. Aren't we all going? No. Why? You're doing our heads in... Be quick about it! You need to get some petrol. I'm going that way. - Ok, bye. - Bye. - Hello, Victor. - Hello. - How is Florin? - He's OK. Bye. Bye. In my day, there weren't any burgers with ketchup. My mother used to make us sweet-bread and we were happy. Alex, don't you want to see your present? Have a look, darling. Super! - 'Master of Puppets', Alex! - Super! - You like it? - Yes, it's super! Didn't they have it in any other colours? They're meant to be black. All of them are black? Didn't they have any blue or green ones... - They're meant to be black. - I see. Let's order, it's late. Alex, put it on! - Here, at the table... - So what? - We would like to order. - Yes, please. I'd like a salad and a cappuccino. Alex, what would you like? - A hamburger with fries. - Fries. Right. A hamburger for me, too. The same as you, Alex! With crosses on it! My Lord! So, Alex. Are you and your mum coming to Bucharest? I don't know. Let me see if I can take my day off, if Cecilia can cover for me... - We could also go by train. - Yeah, by train! - By train? - Yes! - By train? - Yeah! - Or by car? - No, by train! [Singing Happy Birthday] - Happy Birthday, Alex! - Happy Birthday! What the hell happened to you? - Don't even ask... - Let's get a move on, we're in a hurry. - Hi. - Hi. Up a bit. A bit more. Hello. Is it him? Where are you? None of your business where I am. Where the hell are you? Fang... Fang... Where is he? At home. Hey! Florin, where did you leave the car? Where have you been? Here. Where the fuck else? Where have you been? Why don't you answer the phone? Are you crazy? Where's the car, Florin? I sold it. What do you mean, you sold it? Who to? I gave it to Cristi. He's going to sell it. What do you mean, Cristi's going to sell it? What? Wasn't it for sale? But you can't just sell it like that! You kept complaining you couldn't sell it! Now it's sorted! We've got money! You kept complaining about money... Here's the fucking money! You think it's my job to run around like a madman looking for you? Please, don't be so melodramatic... You know what your problem is, Florin? You don't even realise what's going on... Maybe you should tell me, what's going on? Where have the two of you been? Looking for you... You oaf... Looking for me? I was right here... Can't you see me? Come on, don't get mad... We can walk there... It's not far... You're both crazy. I don't think you're right in the head either... What do you mean? And why do you keep lugging those skis around? You think I came here for a lecture? I need 500. Understand? I need 500, not your shitty lectures. You know what? Do what you want. I don't care anymore. What do you mean? I've got problems of my own. You've got problems? Yes. I've got my own problems! You've got problems? So you think you have problems? You're both bad seeds... - What did you say? - Nothing. Tell me what you said? Repeat what you fucking said! You know what? Fuck you! I wanted to start a family. Do you know what a family means? Do you know what a family means? Do you? And what the fuck are you all staring at? Fuck you all! You should come over... ...he'll teach you... How to mix them, how to prepare them... These don't mix together. Alright then. You think you know everything... Anyway, you have to mix in less of that... What the fuck is it you like about Canada? In this day and age... - That's where the music is. - Bollocks... They're all slaves of the record labels, anyway. That's true. A bunch of slaves. Fucking slaves... Do you realize how many slaves there are on this planet? Too many. 99 percent are slaves. Did you sell those skis, Victor? What skis? Yeah, he's selling a pair of skis. He tried to sell them to me. - You've got some skis? - Yeah. That's what he's like. He'd sell anything. Leave him alone, he's really stressed out... He's exhausted from working all day long... Yeah, Victor's really busy... Yeah, he's busy... Tell me, what are we supposed to be celebrating here? Don't you get it? No. It's the Opel party! Opel party, Daddy! Be more Opel-minded... Santa Claus, cupcake, gift... ...nail, straw, truncheon... - Truncheon! - Thank you. Gigi... Joint... Want to have a taste, Victor? Come on... Maybe if you add some pálinka to it... It won't kill you. Try it, you'll end up in Canada. Believe me, you will! He's already there. - Come on! - I'm on my way... Try it, you fucking square... Find out what it's like... You'll see why... Forget about it, Victor drinks all kinds of shit... Everything except diesel! Why not tell us about your plan... What plan, Florin? Your secret plan... What, Victor? You've got plans? Yeah man, he's got a secret plan... to... to cut my head off... and replace it with a dog's head... What a load of bollocks! You think I don't realize? You want to cut my head off and replace it with a dog's head, so you can control me... so you can be happy... ...at getting rid of me... What's that? One of our songs. Oh yeah? I though you were trying to tell me something! Sing something... more tuneful... so everybody can dance... with more of a beat and... Fuck off! Want some more chocolate? Levi. Levi, wake up! Levi. Levi. Levi. Levi. Levi! Come on, wake up! Hello... Good evening. Someone has taken ill... He passed out. Lovin, Victor... Sovata Street number 28, apartment 23. No madam, 23. What's wrong with the address? What do you mean, madam? 21 years old. I'm not joking, it's an emergency! Get the fuck away! He's taken ill, do you think I'm joking? No, madam. Aren't we humans, too? I can't believe this... What are you doing here? Is he ill? Florin, leave him alone. Did you pull out his tongue? Please, Florin, leave him alone. There's nothing wrong with him. Are there any cigarettes left? Did you call an ambulance? And? He's fine! Do you want anything from downstairs? No, thanks. Come on, don't you want anything from the shop? - What shop? - You know... Fuck off with your shop. What? Nobody forced you. Fuck off! You fuck off! Bye... ...we'll talk tomorrow... Bye. You really don't want anything from downstairs? No. What are you doing? What the fuck do you want? Can't you see I was crossing the road? What the fuck's got into everyone? Are you following me? So you can run me over? Is that what Iliescu taught you? To run people over on pedestrian crossings? What? Want to go to the police station? Why don't we go straight to the hospital? Who's going to take the boys to the concert in Bucharest? You!? Who's going to put up the posters? What the fuck are you looking at? Are you going to put the posters up? Are you? Go home to your TVs. Watch the news! Back home to your TVs! Everyone back home to their TVs! Bucharest! We're The Iguanas from Oradea. You know where Oradea is, right? Somewhere in the north-west. Yeah... We've got a slight problem this evening... As usual... Levi, our drummer, isn't feeling very well... He ate something rancid... And I think he's a bit rancid, too... So let me introduce you to another anonymous face. The unique, unequalled, one of a kind... our skin-bursting, stick-breaking drummer, Big Daddy! I'll let you in on a secret. Big Daddy really is my daddy. So, Big Daddy, don't let us down! We've also got Horia on guitar. Paul on bass. I'm Fang and we're The Ig-fucking-uanas! In the spirit of The Iguanas... Scream and shout! Scream and raise hell! The Iguanas! Big Daddy, are you ready?!
