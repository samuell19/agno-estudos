The cold: Cutting, stinging. All common sense was devastated by the brisk bitterness of this place, as starvation that led to unendurable pain, endless agony, hysteria took the helm. Sailing even my most rational men into a dark and cruel unknown, into this, the frozen white nightmare from which none of them would return. Oh, no! No! Lemon juice, Mr. Ashcroft? Mr. Blackwood. Lemon juice, Mr. Redgrave? Mr. Redgrave? Lemon juice? Oh, yes, thank you. Oi, Marlowe, you've had yours. Plenty to go around, Simmons. Maybe you'd ration it? Now back to the galley and clean your pot, you old crab. What are you sketchin' today, Redgrave? It's not finished yet. It don't matter! Ahh. Ahh! -Who's she then? -No one! A little fantasy of yours, eh, Redgrave? A scally lad like you wouldn't even know what to do with her if you had her. You know, you keep your head buried in that journal you might never actually experience any of this expedition with your own eyes. This is what we have to document our journey. When we're back to Grindleton Marsh, I'll be selling these to the papers, proof of our great rescue mission. Selling them? The better ones fetch me a good price. So while us petty officers are mopin' about listening to this racket, you're earnin' more than any of us without breakin' a sweat? Perform every duty asked of me on the Innsmouth. Teach me to draw like that. Can you draw, Marlowe? I can do anything better than most men if I put my head to it. Come on. Help me earn some extra for the family back home. With time, I'd consider it. Don't have much of a family, do you, Redgrave, from what I hear? You know nothing about me! Just being friendly, lad! Will you draw me next, Charles? I want me face on "The Morning Herald". Your grubby mug's not worth printin' on the "Grindleton Packet", let alone "The Herald". That's not what your wife was tellin' me the night before we set off. Don't know how long we can continue this for, Redgrave. For goodness sake, we're stocked to last three years on this ship, if needs be. And Captain Mortimer says that we're headed back come close of winter. The Captain's an optimist. Two winters passed before we came looking for Ayebaun. You think men like Marlowe Spriggs are bastardly now, you wait to see how they behave on half rations when their bellies are achin', and men like you become easy targets. It'll never come to that. I've seen it, Charles! Men are like animals. They'll fight like dogs over a scrap of salt pork. Ah, Christ! If we get caught, it'll be the cat 'o nine for us both. If anyone finds out, I'll take the blame. You can say I stole from the galley. Oh, I will. I've had some lashings in my time, never again. The salt beef, you know where I keep the tins. Carmen, it's me. Sir Roland? Barnabas McCulloch is here to see you. He insists it's urgent. Send him in. -Mortimer. -Barnabas, old mate. Have a drink, perhaps? I'm afraid we have more pressing matters at hand, Captain. Best we keep all our wits about us now. Gideon? This is our passage. The same route mapped by Captain Streiner on the Ayebaun. The waters that we've sailed into are becoming evermore unsafe. We're floating off course, and the ice is growing thicker. The men have reported seeing great slabs pass us by. Barnabas, the Innsmouth is no ordinary ship. My father had the hull plated with iron. We can cut through these sheets. Your father is back home in Grindleton Marsh. We are in the middle of a half frozen polar ocean, Gideon. Further north than any ship that's safely returned has ever sailed! Pardon me, Mr. McCulloch, we are but days away from Sir William Streiner's last known position. We must be brave. We will return as heroes when we find the Ayebaun and her crew. Before that, we may be required to take some risks. Believe me, Mortimer, I am as invested as you in finding your lost friend, but this, this is old ice. Navigating a safe passage is near impossible now that we've entered these winter months. How impossible? We must set a new course. Retreat immediately, or the Innsmouth will freeze into the ice sheet, where it will remain for the rest of winter, floating further and further north, until it is too late! It's a 400 ton ship, Barnabas. You underestimate her. I'm not talking to you, Gideon! -Please, Captain! -Gideon is right. We are a war ship, the Ayebaun was a schooner. To find Streiner, we must follow his treacherous path as far as these waters allow. The Innsmouth has just returned from two years service on the Mediterranean Sea. This is the unrelenting Arctic! Lower your voice, Barnabas! We are listening! Then hear me when I say, this place, it doesn't care about you, it doesn't care about your great desires or yearnings, your dedication to this cause. It only knows that we are warm flesh and blood, and how to freeze the very life from us. I will return with Streiner dead or alive. That was my promise and I intend to keep my word. Hear! Hear! Alter our course wherever you see fit, but we go onwards. We do not retreat. Captain. Barnabas, please! Listen to the Captain. He's an Arctic veteran. He'll get us safely home. Lieutenant, you come into this position from a life of privilege. If you expect to return safely to that life, then shut up and listen to someone who knows what they're talking about! Our asshole captain wants only to find Streiner and that doomed ship! I fear he sees the rest of us as expendable. He will not give you a second thought when you are cold and desperate, and begging like a bitch for his help, if this expedition goes array. If you don't believe in our assignment, then why even come? I was ordered, Gideon. Because too few men on board Innsmouth know a bloody thing about polar exploration. What is it that you so believe in here, Gideon? Is it Streiner's recovery, or do you simply want to be the first to make this great voyage on board your father's precious vessel? Enough! I could make your life very difficult back home, if you don't start showing me some courtesy here, McCulloch. Convince him to turn us around. You're as afraid as the rest of us. Mother of sweet divinity! Captain! Captain! Ready our men to dig! The dogs are barkin' at somethin' out there. Seals? Our dogs don't bark at seals. Listen up, chaps. Captain Mortimer wants you all out on the ice. We're gonna cut a channel before we're completely frozen in. Up you get. I want you all gathered on the main deck in a quarter hour. Not gonna let a patch of frost stop the Innsmouth in her tracks. Onwards to glory, men. -Mr. Spriggs? -Sir? You and Ashcroft go down to the cargo hold to check it for damage. Right away, Lieutenant. If you'll pardon me, Lieutenant, someone should inform Redgrave. Perhaps he could check the hold? Indeed, see that he helps. Would seem the size and strength of Innsmouth has worked against us. Shallow waters, gentlemen, and poor navigation. What use is a one ton steam engine now, eh? But to sink us to the frozen depths. Just a minor worry of mine, Lieutenant. Redgrave? Redgrave! Redgrave, open up! What in hell's name is this? Marlowe, please! You mustn't tell a soul. What's a woman doin' on board, eh? You've been harborin' a stowaway, Redgrave. That's a very serious and punishable offense. She was in the cargo hold. It was already too late. The Captain will have you flogged. Both of ya. That's somethin', I dare say, I'll enjoy. Other men's suffering can be quite entertainin' with little else to keep you occupied. Keep this between us. For her sake! She has her reasons for journeying out here, Marlowe. Please? What's in it for me to keep my lips tight, eh? Oh, oh! How 'bout them drawings? Said they'd fetch a tidy price, did you not? Those are mine. If you wanted to buy my silence, this is a start. Give those back! -Stop it! -Ah, it speaks! I'd keep my pretty, little voice quiet. Others might hear you. Must think you're real smart, Redgrave. I never took you for much of a fanny rat. Keepin' all that to yourself, was ya? Better pray nobody else finds out. Could be dangerous havin' a rat aboard a boatload of men, all away from home, all missin' their wives. Do you know what I mean, Redgrave? In a place so destitute of pleasures, some might not be able to control their urges. You're a bloody pig! I have a family out here! Lost in an expedition! Can't you understand? Don't you have a brother or a sister? This is the Arctic, deary. No place for you. It's not like the fanciful tales you read about back home. Even men struggle out here. Now, I'll escort you to the Captain, unless we've got a deal, Little Mr. Redgrave? Give it back to him. I go to the Captain myself. Keep your shit drawings then. This'll be worth it just to see Mortimer's face. And Redgrave, when your bollocks have come back down from your gut, Ashcroft's waitin' in the cargo hold. You're to inspect it for damage. Captain? You'll bloody want to see this. What now? Mr. Spriggs, get in here! She's a stowaway, Captain Mortimer, sir! I found her hiding in Redgrave's cabin. How have we not noticed a stowaway on board?! Redgrave kept her secret, sir. I warned her she'll be flogged, but she don't seem to give a monkey's ass. What's your name? -Carmen. -Carmen. I know not how or why you find yourself aboard the Innsmouth, hundreds of miles north in these Arctic waters, but we are ice locked, which was our greatest fear. Whatever you hope to achieve by coming here, home, warmth, safety, even the simplest comforts are far, far from us now. You must do as us men do, if you wish to live through this. No time for weakness now, lady. The Arctic has no mercy. Are you gonna punish her?! Our situation here is punishment enough. Ashcroft? Ashcroft's in the cargo hold. Stay here! Keep watch on her! Quickly, men! Fuck! Christ! Get him to the infirmary! -Where's Ashcroft? -Dead! He's dead! Dead? There's something in the cargo hold, Captain. Some beast. -Some creature. -Barnabas, the infirmary! Hello? Marlowe, that you? Greedy hog! Who's in here? Redgrave, is that you? That's a monstrous talon. There's somethin' in the cargo hold all right. Somethin' deadly. How could we possibly have sailed this long with something of that size in the hold unnoticed? Well, it don't belong to Whiskers the cat. We failed to notice a stowaway onboard. There could be anything down there now! Something has found its way inside! I saw it. A creature. I can't explain it. It's amphibious and man-like. What have you given him, McCulloch? He's gone bloody doolally. No, no, no, please! It walked like us. It had the face and features of some fish. Fins, and gills, and webbed hands, and rugged, horrid cracked teeth, -and- -Calm yourself, lad. This creature, could you draw it, Mr, Redgrave? Maybe we should let him rest, Captain? Draw exactly what you saw. That's an order. What's happening? You wait in here, lady! Why? Hey! Where are you going? This is some diluted fantasy. I'll not believe it! Stay with Redgrave. The men await me on the main deck. Marlowe? I want everyone on board armed. Take this and fill it with every musket and shotgun we have. Aye, Captain. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph! Spriggs, grab everything you can. We're going on to the ice. Outside? We must get off this ship! Another creature is in, kill the damn thing. Aye, Captain! Captain? Anybody? Gideon! Where is she? You were watching over the stowaway. She's on the ship! You wanted her to stay put. Oh, damn you, Gideon! For God's sake! We stay together! You'll die out there alone! They're coming for us! Sir Roland, it's every man for himself in there! Anyone left is surely dead by now! In here! What's happening? Where is everybody? Everyone's dead. We have to go now. How did you get that? Need powder. Help me. What's this? Go! Brace yourself. Jesus! Now we walk. No, no, no, wait! I can feel my eyeballs freezing in their sockets. Just don't take your dick out for a piss or you'll freeze the tip off. And there'll be very little left. Captain, there's nothing out there but ice and misery! Keep moving, Marlowe. Don't give up. Give up what, Captain? All is lost! Ahh, you're still thinking about Streiner, aren't you?! But he's out there, and they could help us. Oh, for god's sake, Roland! They may be our best chance of survival now. You just can't give it up, can you?! Why?! All our men are dead! No doubt we'll either starve or freeze out here. How are you still so hell bent on trying to find them now?! Streiner was my brother and partner for decades. We traveled the world together. He's like a brother to me! And yet, he came to cross the North Pole without you? We came to rescue the man, not end up stranded like him! Or are we just? If they're out there, they could save us, you moron! Streiner had the Ayebaun built wide and shallow. She was to freeze into the ice and drift with the currents over the Pole. In theory, or it could be sunk years ago. Roland! The Ayebaun could be anywhere! We'll never find it! Yeah. -I'm fine. -So what? Should we just lie down here in the cold and die? I'll search for Streiner until my dying breath. Men? Captain! It's Redgrave, sir, and the stowaway. Redgrave. You're alive! Any other survivors? Not that we could see, Captain. I thought we were the only ones out here. You left us to die. She came back for me. I owe her my life. Can you go on, man? He can make it with some help. Barnabas, Gideon, lend him a hand. Now, lift! You're all right, lad. We have a long walk ahead. Captain! In the mountains, there's an opening. How far? Probably not even half a mile. Half a mile, and there may be shelter. I don't know, Captain. I can't feel this leg anymore. If you can't feel it, then it shouldn't be as painful. We can't stay out here. It's too dangerous. I know we're almost there, and I know the Ayebaun is out there. I know you can make it! Marlowe, give 'em a hand. Why can't the woman do it? She dragged him out here. She's done enough! Fine. Come on. Let's go. Come on. There could be anything in there. But it's free of wind and snow, I'm willing to take my chances. Well, we can't stay out here. Oh, no. Okay. Redgrave, look at me. Stay together. Well, it looks like we wasn't the first to find this place. One of Streiner's men. Oh, that's just perfect! We can all guess what killed him. He's been shot. Arm yourselves. Be on your guard. All right. Gideon! You! Have you used a gun before? I'll manage. Two of us should go on ahead, make sure it's safe before we venture much deeper. Lieutenant! I come. Best not to argue with her. Wait here. You knew him? Oh, god, you knew him. I'm sorry. What's going on? I told you to stay put! We heard screaming! It's nothing. These mountains seem empty, for now, at least. Only the dead rest here. Ah, that's bloody repugnant! That's revoltin'. Marlowe, that's enough. We all cover him up. Don't you touch him! Don't you dare! Leave her. Come on. Let her be. I warned you the Arctic was no place for a woman. Go on ahead, and find somewhere close for us to settle. This way. Hello? We have enough supplies to last us a week at most. Are you worried, McCulloch? Someone will eventually have to journey back. If there's any supplies on the ship, we're going to need it. And if Innsmouth has been crushed and sunk, it'll be a waisted trip. We have a month, at best, before starvation takes hold of all of us. There's enough food on board Innsmouth to last us years. In that time, a rescue party will find us. Years. How many years? Hopefully, not too many, Redgrave. And what if nobody's coming for us? Charles, let's take a look at that leg of yours. It's warm now. Warm you say? I don't think it's too bad. We should all check our feet. Don't want to find our toes turned black. Black? Frostbite, Gideon. Can you feel this? No. This? No, sir. This? No, sir. Am I going to be well enough to walk again, sir? Just rest up, Mr. Redgrave. Surely the best option's just chop it off? Or else the infection will spread. Gideon, we will not be amputating any limbs here. We don't have the necessary medical supplies to do so safely! Then he's certain to die! Keep your bloody voice down! Every day he's alive he'll be eating through our rations, scoffing what few supplies we have left. We're already facing starvation. Starvation we could alleviate, if we just look at the situation rationally. He's a burden on us. Gideon, it isn't just your life at stake here! You don't have any exclusive entitlements out here in the wilderness. Rank, especially when it's as ill-deserved as yours, doesn't matter here! We all need to help each other now, as Captain Mortimer insisted! You said, "Every man for himself". Those were your words. I was scared and irrational. For god's sake, Gideon, be a man! Where are you going? If you don't mind, Redgrave, I'm off to take a shit. Or would you rather I do it here so you can absorb the odors? So my poppet princess over there can watch over you now. Oh! Oh, Spriggs, you bute, you. William? William? William? They like it, the Ichthyoids. They enjoy our music, can you believe? You're alive! It's a gramophone, a gift from the Lady Charlotte. One of the few things I salvaged from the wreck. Come in where I can see you, man. In the name of Dagan! Roland Mortimer! The only man I knew I could depend on. You finally came! You're alone, William? Are there others? All dead, dear friend. But I'm far from alone. You found the book, I presume? It led you to these mountains. That rotten, old thing you left behind? You had time to study its pages, as I did. It's just gibberish, William. Old gibberish. Mortimer, you were also so simple-minded! You could never match my accomplishments. You've seen the Ichthyoids. -The what? -The Ich-thy-oids! Creatures from the ice. They annihilated my crew. So you know that they are real. The pages of the book speak true. You came here for the North Pole, not because of some book. You want to be the first! You're obsessed! The Pole was never the prize! It was always them! The deep ones! They are exactly as they are depicted, only more exquisite! Don't you see, Roland? Land, water, this freezing ice, they can endure it all! You speak of them as if they're intelligent beings. Yes, yes! They're intelligence is staggering. They are superior, and we are their servants. Come, sit with me, and celebrate! Two years isolation and the gloom has clouded your thoughts, William. You have lost your own purpose! Mortimer, the government was never going to fund an expedition based on some obscure Arabic book. I had to mount an expedition on the pretense of being the first to reach the geographical North Pole. I lied to you, Mortimer. The very notion of us conquering the universe in lunacy. Exploring every corner, as if we were the first. If not for the Pole, then what was your plan? What delusions has a book seeded in your brain?! Why, return with my Ichthyoids, of course! You can't be serious? They'd wreak havoc on land! There'd be war! Yes, yes! And we would be on their side, you and I! You would let loose the most hideous creatures I've ever laid eyes on in our home? I'll not allow it! Too late, Roland! You came! You are the rescue party. The bridge between the ancient beings and all of pitiful mankind! I'd rather die than take over plague of death! Don't be foolish. You're insane, William. No, not insane! But I have had two years to think it through, to comprehend the master plan. You've had two minutes, Roland! Your puny human mind can't comprehend it now, but it will. And then, it will all make perfect, glorious sense. I came for you! I kept my promise! I risked my life, my crew! Men died at the quest to find you! And now you speak of mankind as if they're expendable?! Have you no care, sir?! Dear God care when he flooded the earth? Did he care when he sent a pestilence to kill thousands in Israel? You're psychotic! No, I am more than human. I have knowledge, Roland. I have seen what our future is. If you want to live, you'll come to your senses! You need me, Roland. You need me! Lieutenant? Lieutenant? Spriggs! Get your gun, Gideon! What about her? Leave her! She's no use to us now! Oh, no! Let go! Whoa! Gah! Ahh! No! Gideon! Gideon! God! Gideon! Gideon, help me! Help me, Gideon! Gideon! Gideon! Gideon! Help me! Come on! Gideon, take my... Take my hand! -Okay. -Get it off me! They're everywhere! Try and get one of them. They got Marlowe. Captain! Wait! Captain! We can't give up yet, Captain. You're better than that. We can't go home. We mustn't go home. But they'll send a rescue party. No, they can't see what we found here. Others will come, men like Streiner, men like me! There was no expedition to the Pole. He only came for them. Captain Streiner, he's alive? No, something resembling him and his worst qualities. Rescuing him now is the last thing on earth you want to do. The Innsmouth must be destroyed. We cannot let them leave! But they'll send a rescue ship! Well, I pray they don't make it this far. Captain? That's a huge sacrifice. Not just for you, but for all of us. I know. I'm sorry, but it must be done. If you're certain, Roland... If you're sure this is the thing to do? Who knows. Are those creatures real? Were all men truly slaughtered? It was real, Captain? That's our worst nightmares. Then Streiner must be killed before this progresses any further. But Captain, -you know that's- -I know, I know! But it's my duty! And the Innsmouth? Do we leave her to the ice? We don't risk her making it through winter. There are explosives on board. Leave it to me. What in god's name will you tell the rest of them?! Leave them their hope just a little longer. Why do I have to go? Why can't the Captain take care of it? Because you're Lieutenant. It's what you signed up for! It's your duty! Take her with you. She's not scared of those things. She's staying to watch over Redgrave, and fight them off if they come back. Well, I can do that. You don't give a damn about Redgrave. And when it comes to those creatures, you're bloody useless. Oh, please, just give me a chance? Gideon, without the supply run, we won't last a week. You'll be safe with Barnabas. I'll be praying that you're all here and alive when we return. It's only a matter of time before they come back to feed. Good luck. Captain. Captain? Wouldn't it be better if we went back to the ship? You'd never make it. No one should have to stay because of me. It's only a matter of time before the ice crushes the ship. This is our base now. I'll not leave you behind. Then what's our plan? We can't just sit and wait for them to pick us off one by one. Why wait? Why not fight? Lay every last one of them to waste. There could be hundreds of them out there. Good, more for me to kill! We've already lost Spriggs. We need to be careful! Look after our wounded! I'm not his nurse. I'm not here to mother anyone. I'm here to survive, to fight for my life! You've underestimated me, Captain, and I overestimated you. From here on, I do things my way. No more hiding. We could man the ship ourselves, couldn't we, and go for help? We're not leaving them in the mountains, Gideon. We'd return and save them later. They only have a week's supply of food, for Christ's sake! Just feels wrong going back there to those things. We don't have a choice, Gideon! We don't have to listen to everything Captain Mortimer says. Following him has done none of us any favors. As long as we are out here he is still our captain. Once fear and hunger take hold, we will struggle to behave rationally. Let's just follow orders and stay alive. Mortimer, you've come to your senses, I presume? You'll join me in my insurrection of the ancient ones. Step into the light, so we can negotiate. There's no point to playing these games, William! I've sent my men to destroy the Innsmouth! You've no way home! Liar! I followed your lead, walked in your shadow, but this madness, I cannot permit it! Madness? If you think you can stop them, you're the one who's mad, Mortimer. But why help them, damn you?! They came to me in dreams, chose me to awaken them from their deep and endless slumber. Flesh and blood, Mortimer, the key to their rebirth. Join me in their servitude or die! Let go! What have you become, you monster?! -I am more than human. -No! There's still time! We can set them back to sleep, William. Don't try and stop me. I have an army of them at my side. I've changed, Mortimer. I've embraced their ways, as they have embraced mine. When I arrived, they walked on all fours, but they developed. Soon, they were walking upright, like us, faster, more agile. Is that not brilliant?! And they're my discovery. My gift to the world! Eat this. Go on. Do it. Kill your old friend. You can't, can you? Can't pull the trigger on another man. You're not man anymore. She's still standing. Thank god! What if those things are still on there? No time for your cowardness now. Oh, god. Let's make this quick. All right. You head to the galley. On my own? Oh, for god's sake, yes, Gideon! Stop talking to me like that! I'm scared! Keep your bloody voice down. We don't have time for this! Where are you going? I have to find something. Barnabas? Barnabas, is that you? God, Gideon! What are you doing? The Captain has instructed us to blow up the ship. Blow up the ship?! It's too much to explain now, but we must follow his orders. Trust me! Barnabas, this is my ship. It's our only way out of here. Our only way home. We can't go home. Not with those creatures potentially aboard. Think, Gideon! We must sink it. We can't wait two more years for a rescue party -to come for us! -Get your hands off me! We'll be dead by then! We're all gonna die anyway, Gideon! I tried to warn you about our situation. I didn't wanna get us into this! But people like you and Mortimer had to have things your way. Well, damn you! Now we all must pay the price! I have accepted my fate. So for once in your bloody life, stop being so gutless. Lend a hand- I'll not be left for dead out here. What happened? I'll show you. Mortimer. How's the hand? You didn't tell me you'd brought a female. How did this happen? She was a stowaway. Oh, magnificent! They've never seen a female. This will be a first for them. Just think what they can learn from her anatomy. Think of what they can do to use her. Streiner, Captain of the Ayebaun. Well, what's left of him anyway. It's been many years since I set eyes on a woman. If my hands weren't tied, I would be inside you in a heartbeat. You knew my brother, Benito. Benito? Benito? Yes! Yes, yes, I remember. A weakling. Blew his brains out. Such a waste. It's not what I brought him out here for. You led those men out here to die! Sacrificial lambs, Mortimer! I came here with a cargo of living flesh. Their deaths are insignificant in the wake of my discoveries. He was my family. How many of them you bring here to die? How many of them you take from their families? Oh, does it matter?! Human life is so short and utterly pointless. Tell her, Roland. The Ichthyoids live for eons. Not when I shoot them in the head! This is who we came here for? The great captain of the North Pole? He lied, but at least we have him now. Captain? -Captain? -Gideon. Watch Redgrave. They attacked us! They came out of nowhere. What happened? They killed Barnabas. I couldn't fight them. All right, all right. The Innsmouth, is she destroyed, Gideon? We sunk it with dynamite. Good, good. At least he didn't die in vain. I'm sorry I couldn't bring any supplies, captain. I had to get out of there. Captain? What is it, Captain? Nothing. Go on. Charles? Carmen. Carmen. -Benito? -Carmen. Carmen. Oh, no, Gideon. No! I know you. You're Sir Henry Roth's son. -Gideon? -Yeah. You're Captain Streiner. They found you. Captured me, actually. I thought Mortimer was your friend? So did I, my boy. But the cold does things to a man's mind. Gives him strange inclinations. Nobody's thinking rationally anymore. Exactly! Mortimer was devastated I'd got this far. He wants the glory for himself. They tried to blow up my father's ship, HMS Innsmouth. So, did they?! I stopped them. Oh, clever. You really are Sir Henry's son. I had much admiration for your father. If I'd been captain of Innsmouth, I would've had you back before winter. I could've saved you this suffering, Mr. Roth. I just wanna get back to England. I can get you home. Indeed, we'd have to wait until the ice melts, but I could captain Innsmouth back to land. Years I've waited for you to find me. Years I've suffered in this freezing darkness. These mountains can be cruel, Mr. Roth. You escaped the creatures? Dogs. Nothing more than dogs that can be taught to respect their masters with a few simple tricks. Your crew, I've seen the bodies. They had small minds. They lost themselves in these mountains of madness. But you're smarter than them. You see this retched body of mine? Is that what you want to become? -No. -Then free me. Free me, and together, we'll escape this place. No, no, no, no, no! Gideon! It's this way, Captain. I know you! From my dreams. Those dreams belong to me. Captain! Captain! Thank you. Better move quickly, Mr. Roth. You... You killed Redgrave. If you want to get home, you will do as I say. No time for questions. Streiner? Streiner, wait! What are we waiting for? The ship's this way! We must draw them to us, Gideon. All of them. Oh, no! No! Charles? No. Redgrave. Get away from it! It's not Redgrave anymore. This is it! The obelisk. The great stone that commands the deep ones. Commands them? I said we were going home, Mr. Roth. I never said we'd be going alone. -Whoa! -Streiner, you bastard! And God said, "Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures!" No! Sir! Streiner! Shoot them! Shoot them, lady! Now, shoot them! Cheerio, mate! It's too late, Roland. Nothing can stop them. It's over. You know I can't let you walk out of here. No puny human can stand in their way. Come out and fight like a man! Drop the gun. Stop this. Come home with me, Roland! Nobody is going home! I should've left you here to rot. So many years out in the cold, but at least you'll feel a little warmth on the way out. So long, old friend. It is time, my children! Time to decamp this frozen hell. Time to reclaim your world! Ready? You're okay. Look at it. This frozen, white nightmare. Boundless, but free of men. The Arctic wants to kill us, but at least it's simple and transparent in its aim. Out here, I can die with dignity.
