Open your eyes now. Three... ... two... ... one. Bona... ... I really wish you and the others could drop by. This city smells of re-varnished old wood. A smell with a long history. Old... ... and sometimes worn out. However, it never lacks the energy to create. I need that energy, Bona. Let me know soon, Bona. I am sure you will join me. Hey, Ms Tiana. You're Ms Tiana, right? Yes? Mr Handoko sent me. Yeah. Here, the house is right here. - Let me carry it. - Take this, Sir. - Let me pay, Ms Tiana. - Thank you. Hey, give her money back. Take this. - Thanks, Sir. - This is the house. Isn't it huge? Is this the house I paid for? Oh, yes. Once this house was occupied by a nobleman, a titled general. People around here call him "General". Well, anyway, this is it. However, not the entire house. Only this part is yours. Now... Please come inside, Ms Tiana. Come, come. This is the bathroom. Is that an access to the main house? Yes, but the owner doesn't want anyone to enter from here. I've locked it. - I am Lono. - I am Tiana. - Okay. - Where is the General? - He's in Italy. - Is that so? That Italy? - He had to fly there. - Wow. Hompimpa... - ...alaium gambreng. - It's me! Excuse me. The music is too loud. - Uh, what's the matter? - Who... Who are you, Ma'am? Oh, I am the housekeeper here... ... along with my son, Lono. What's the matter, Miss? Nothing. It's just the music is too loud. - I'm sorry. - It's okay, Ma'am. It's not you who should be apologizing. Oh, but I am feeling bad, Miss. I will tell Mr Harun... ... not to play music that loud. Good night, Miss. It's nice to be a novelist. You get to write and go on vacation at the same time. Who said it's a vacation? I am actually stressed. Now I have to use my savings. Well, no publisher has bought my pitch yet. Well, it's because you take so long to write. Now, now. You'd better take one of my ideas. No way. Your story is too soap opera-ish. They sell well, though. Enough with all your idealism. - Are you Ms Tiana? - Yes. Miss, this book has a fantastic story. It's very good. Why haven't you written any more book? - I'm actually writing one. - Is that so? - Can I take a picture with you? - Okay. Wait, Miss, wait. Excuse me. Yes, can I help you? Can you please take these stuff to my place? - These? To your place there, right? - Here, here. Yeah. Come forward a little bit. Come. - Miss, where should I put them? - Please put them against the wall. Yes, Miss. Oh, Ma'am. Excuse me, Miss. Mr Harun invites you to join him for breakfast tomorrow. Can you make it, Miss? You will, won't you? Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Good night, Miss. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Oh, please come in, Miss. I thought you forgot, Miss. I've been waiting for quite a while. Please come, please come. Come, come. Don't be shy. - I can help myself. - Oh, yes, sure. Please make yourself at home, Miss. Thank you. Sir, should I serve the food now? Yes. Please make yourself at home, Miss. Before you ask about why I invited you here, first of all... ... thank you for coming. Secondly, thank you for delivering the important letter to me. Well... It's nothing much. That's nothing much for you? So, being kind to others is nothing much for you? That's what I have been taught all along. Hmm... If that is nothing much for you... ... is this breakfast invitation appropriate? If it's just breakfast like now, it's fine. A candle light dinner would have been a different story. Candle light dinner, you say. Well, well. Breakfast is ready. Here. It's hot and homemade breakfast. There is some more coming. This, too, is nothing much for me. I was taught this way. Why would you do that? What do you mean? If you don't like me checking the ashtray, I can return it. Just tell me. I didn't know that. How could you not know? Isn't it obvious? Here comes freshly cooked, please enjoy. This is the Javanese rice. So soft. Here. Sir, if you need anything, please call me. - Thank you, Ma'am. - You are welcome. Enjoy the food. Bona. I cannot wait to see you here. I want to talk with you... ... and laugh about life again. Also, I met someone here. Well, he's not like re-varnished old wood. Neither is he like a fine wood. Is Mr Harun home? Yes, he is. Please come in. Sir. - What is it? - Ms Tiana is here. - Yes? - Ms Tiana is here. Oh! Yes. Good morning! You like me, don't you? It's me, the housekeeper. I just want to give you a token of gratitude... ... for your breakfast invitation. Oh. I don't need such token. Actually, Mr Harun can be nice and friendly... ... if he wants to, can't he, Ma'am? That's right. Actually, he is kind, friendly, and handsome. Alright, then. See you later, Ma'am. Okay, Miss. Have I sinned? Why? I wasn't asking you. I don't need it. I don't need this recommendation letter. How many times I have told you that? What is he doing? Don't kick up a row, Sir. I've told my father that I don't need it. Ma'am, Ma'am. Your father loves you. He wants you to pursue your education. - Ma'am. Harun... - Tiana, don't intervene. Don't intervene! She must've called you here. She must've called you here! - Harun! - She must have! - Sir. - Ma'am, please wait a second. I don't need your intervention. - Ma'am, please calm down. - Miss... - You should rest. - I don't want your intervention. - Harun! - Do not intervene. - Hey! You should... - I don't want your intervention! Miss, take some rest. I don't need this. Have I sinned, Ma'am? Why do you think so, My Child? I don't love my mother. I have always been confused... ... as to why I cannot love her. That's why I am here... ... and I will always love you. You can feel it, can't you? I'm blind, not numb. Why did you take me to Kaliurang? To enjoy the view? To make fun of me or what? I'm not trying to make fun of you. I just want to take you here. Yeah, yeah. A wordsmith! Failed poet, are you? I'm a failed novelist. Anyway... How do you know that we're in Kaliurang? Harun? - Where are you going? - Take me home. Home? We're not done yet. It's going to rain. Rain? Use your senses. Hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait! - I will hold him. - Let me help you, Ma'am. It's okay, it's okay. - It's okay, I'm used to this. - Please, Ma'am. - Ma'am! - Oh, God! She should not fall down. Ma'am, Ma'am! Harun, Harun, Harun. - Harun! - Just help us! - What are you doing? - That's what I am doing. Harun! - She fell! - Why are you acting stubborn? Sit here. Just sit here. - Ma'am, Ma'am... - I... Hush. I'm going to help her. Stay there! Ma'am, Ma'am. Can you get up, Ma'am? Hey, come and help us! Don't just watch! What the hell? Help me lift this lady. Take her directly to an orthopaedist, Tiana. She has osteoporosis. She has been treated. I let her stay in the hospital so that her condition can be observed. She should have stayed at her home in Bantul, living happily with her grandchildren. Instead, she wastes her time babysitting me. None of this would have happened if we hadn't gone to Kaliurang. Tomorrow, we'll visit her. Please sit. While waiting for the time to pass... ... let's chat. Whatever. Let's play the Indonesian rock-paper-scissors. The loser... ... will have to answer questions. Come, let's play. One, two, three! I lost. Huh? I lost. Now, you may ask me a question. How do I know if you're winning or losing? What if you are cheating? In that case, we can play the usual rock-paper-scissors. Give me your hand. Let's go. One, two, three! I threw out Scissors. - Okay. - Yes. You may ask me. Why do you want to rent a room here? I don't know. Are all novelists weird like you? Yes, many of them are, but maybe not as weird as me. Have you always been weird since you're young? Apparently so. ... Actually... I feel like we're connected. Hah! Connected? Where did that come from? Since I was a child... ... I've preferred... ... to not see. - What? - Where are you going? Trying to make money, what else? I got used to the dark because of my parents. To an extent... ... I was more comfortable living in darkness. There... ... I can create my own beauty. No, Mum! - Get out! - I don't want to, Mum. - Do you want to be a weirdo? - Mum! Parents don't want a weird child like you! Tiana... Tiana! Open the door. Tiana, Tiana! Have you eaten? Now, this is your room. Don't be scared. There's no need to be. You have me. That's quite a story. It's rather strange. What? What? What is it? I've never seen you smile this much. It was quite entertaining. It was fun listening to your strange story. It's either fun because it's strange, or it's strange because it's fun. Anyway, it's something like that. It's your turn now. Do I have to? Yeah, I've promised. - Haven't I? - You have. Okay. Hmm... Wait, where should I start? Okay. I was a military brat. My father was a soldier. Oh. Why did you say "Oh"? My house doesn't represent that? It's kind of intentional. Well, it's typical. My father is cold... ... private, and strict. Then... ... my late mother didn't like him at all. They're not compatible for each other. He was very violent... ... complained all the time, and kept criticizing. That's how it felt for my mother. That's why I chose to rebel. Being disobedient, gambling, drinking, madat, madon. Basically, moh limo. - Moh limo? - Moh limo, or the five sins, consists of.. ... main, or gambling, madon, or womanising, madat, or using drugs, maling, or stealing, mabok, getting drunk, you know. Then, the sixth sin... The sixth moh... ... is mbikin malu, or becoming an embarrassment. Well, after I stopped doing them, all I did... ... was speeding. You know, nothing much. My hobby was speeding with my father's car... ... and then hit something. If it was destroyed, I felt satisfied. Then, it happened. I went to Kaliurang. I went down the slope... ... and crashed my father's car. The car was not the only thing damaged. My corneas were damaged, too. They suffered from an impact and were not immediately treated. Well... So, I lost my sight. Completely. Blind, disabled... ... and became an embarrassment. You. Before you committed moh limo... ... did you draw? How did you know that? I thought you would've guessed that I would look around. She must have not thrown them out yet. - Harun, Harun! - They should be thrown out! - Harun. - Useless! You are very beautiful. Bona. I have to admit that I let my curiosity about him get the best of me. Just like Alice's curiosity... ... about the white rabbit who walked like human, who eventually led her down the rabbit hole to Wonderland, as told in "Alice in Wonderland." I have figured that out. You never stay put when someone pokes your curiosity. Have I sinned, Bona? Why? Is it because you give him hope? Because... ... I feel like I am taking him to a world that he doesn't want to be in. It could also be... ... that you're telling him that your world and his are the same. Right? Maybe. Tiana. Bona, you are crazy. Oh, my God, Bona! Why didn't you tell me you were coming? Why would I? Come in, come in, Guys. Hey, don't be noisy. He would be angry. You're the one who shouldn't be noisy. - Ta-da! - Ta-da! - Happy birthday! - Oh, my God! You really are crazy. You're the best! Alright, Guys. There is something I want to ask you. Be honest. Have you told Harun that today's your birthday? - Have you told him? - Have you told him? Of course I haven't. It's not the right time yet. Miss Privacy! If it wasn't for us, who would be your friend? - Go ahead. - Yeah, okay. Good morning. Good morning. Did you get the orchid? How do you know, Harun? Excuse me, Mr Harun. Ma'am? Ms Tiana. Is your leg fine now? Thank God, it has got better, Miss. - Thank you so much, Miss. - Yes, Ma'am. I don't know what could have happened if you were not there. Ma'am, I have to go now. Alone? Not together? You must be missing him, so... - See you later. - Yes, go ahead. Harun. See you later. Oh, right. Thanks for the orchid. You're welcome. Hello, Arie. What grade are you in? Grade three. Wow, you're smart. - Please come in, Sir and Madame. - Thank you. Please have a seat. This way, please. Is he the son of the owner of our foundation? - You must be tired from the trip. - Perhaps. Now, close your eyes. Then, imagine what you wish. Come here. What are you doing there? Let's go out and play. Tiana! How are you? I'm fine. I had planned to visit your place, but I didn't want to bother you. You have to finish your novel, after all. How can I write when there's a guest, Arie? Typical artists. You inspired me to become a writer myself. A journal writer, though. Sorry, my hands are not clean. A doctor at last. What would you like to drink? Tea? One tea, please. - No, no, no. - Yes, Sir. - Do you want to eat? - No, no, thanks. One moment, Sir. Tiana... ... I managed to trace your father. Where? - Come with me. - No, no. I... Don't you want to meet him? Tiana. I can take you there anytime. As long as... ... you accept this present. Happy birthday! Phone unlocked. Home. Contact detail. Home. All calls. Dial now. Tiana, 628570... Arie. Who is Arie? Arie... ... is my publisher. The one who keeps checking on your writing, right? How did you get my number? I wondered... ... why you disappeared on your birthday. Then, I thought it's normal. Unlike me, you have a life out there. So... The point is... ... I still want to celebrate... ... your birthday with you. It doesn't have to be today. Tomorrow, I'll be out of town, Harun, because... Well, I have to meet the publisher for two or three days. Oh, okay. What if tomorrow morning... ... we have breakfast together? Do you think you can make it? The housekeeper is planning to... Hello? Hi, Dad. Yes, I'm in Yogyakarta. Do you remember Tiana, Dad? Yes. No, Dad. There's something we have to deal with. Dad, I've decided. I want to go to Italy. Don't worry, Dad. You know policy is always try harder. Discover more. Okay, Dad. Bye, Dad, see you. Can I help you? I would like to meet Mr Rosadi. Is he home? Oh, sure. That way. - Oh, okay. Thank you. - Sure. Who is that? Huh? Who is that? Nurse? More medicines? - You want to give me more medicines? - A severe case of cataract. He also seems to be suffering from dementia. How did he end up here? There's this social worker. You know her. There she is. Surely you know... ... that I no longer work at our old orphanage, right? I'm not surprised. There was only one good person at the orphanage. Only you. Then, how did you help with finding my father? It was Arie's idea. Eventually, I came to work here... ... at this nursing home-cum-orphanage. Now, I'm very happy... ... because this place is full of love. At first, I was hesitant. I wasn't sure if it would be the best for you to meet your father. Still, I also feel... ... that you must continue... ... to live your life... ... with someone you deserve. You must forgive yourself. Nurse? Nurse? More medicine? More medicine? I don't want it. I'm not sick. I'm not. Go away! Go! Go away! Please, Nurse, go away. Are you okay? Yes, I am. Thank you, Arie. Tiana. You still remember my promise, right? If you're still single... ... when you turn 30... Don't tell me... ... you're dating Bona who you always talk about. No. He's my best friend, Arie. Dita Tianasari... ... please accept me as your life partner. We will fulfil our promise now that you're 30. Tiana, what is your answer? I didn't bring anything here. It's because the only thing I should bring... ... is inside your gift. Good morning, Tiana. Morning. How did it go with the publisher? - Good. - Hmm. If I'm not mistaken, your publisher's name is Arie. I was already at the front door last night... ... to bring you an umbrella... Yet, I was blessed... Or should I say "cursed"? With an extremely sharp hearing. Sorry for eavesdropping. - Harun... - Why did you lie? You have been lying to me even until a few seconds ago. I know, Tiana, as a partner, I can't promise you a future. I should've known my place. - Harun... - But why did you have to lie? What? I... What do you take me for? I didn't feel comfortable... ... when you suddenly knew my birthday. Why? Because I never told you before. Oh, so this is about control? - I didn't say that. - No, this is clearly about control. I have never tried to control you, Tiana. So, I'm sorry if... I told you it's not about that, Harun! What is it, then? This key. Why? What about the key? It's still not clear to you? This key and my birthday... Everything makes me feel like... What are you afraid of? What are you trying to hide? I wish you nothing but happiness. What? Accept Arie's proposal. - I want to be with you, Harun! - For crying out loud! Did you hear what you just said? Listen! Record it if you can. Listen to how insulting it is. - It's stupid. - Hey, you're a jerk. Buzz off. Get out of my house! Pack your bags. I'll give you time until tomorrow morning. No! I said, get out! Out! You can drown in your sadness for all I care. That's your problem. Get lost. Bona... Bona? He's a jerk, Bona. A total jerk. Everyone's a jerk. I'm a jerk. I don't know what's wrong with me. But it's clear that Harun is the bigger jerk. I don't understand how to face people like him. He told me to go and drown in my sadness. What does he know about "drowning in sadness"? I hope he feels what it's like to be drowned in sadness. Bona, answer me. - How is it? - Hmm? Come, let's go there. Bona... ... I know you'll be disappointed with my choice. However, life doesn't go in reverse. It doesn't, does it? Bona? Bona? Good morning. Morning. Do you know... ... why I've always adored you? Every time you tell a story... ... your imagination widens my world. I want to conquer that world. Conquer? Through achievements! The point is, you make me want to be a better person. What about your best friend, Bona? Is he like that too? Well, Bona... He always holds me back from becoming a bad person. I'm jealous. Are you seriously jealous of someone who is not here? Yes, not here, but who knows if he is in your heart! Just kidding, Honey. I'm off now. Bye. Mr Harun? - Yes. - Mr Harun. There are some photos. From the art studio of... Here it is. From Ms Runi's art studio. Runi, yes, that's her. - Oh. - Ms Runi. - What photos? - Uh, the photos of... Oh, the photos of you with Ms Tiana. Oh. - Here, Sir. - Help the housekeeper. Don't go anywhere, Sir. Stay here for a second. Slowly. Be careful. I consider you as my own family. More than my blood relatives. I want you to go home. Enjoy the rest of your life. Don't think about me anymore. I can... take care of myself. Don't get upset. You were naked at birth and knew nothing about life. You cannot... bargain with life. Bona? Bona! Bona? - Tiana... - Bona. Sorry, sorry. I have to say that you brought this all upon yourself. - What do you mean? - You were blinded... ... by your desire to hurt Harun. I was shocked, Tiana. This isn't you. - What do you mean, Bona? - You should think about what I said. - Bona, where are you going? - Think about it first. Bona, don't you dare leave me. Please, Bona... please! - I have to go now. - Bona? Please. Bona? Bona... ... you are right. I am selfish. I have always hurt people around me. What's the condition of this patient now? Based on all his reports, the damaged corneas can still be cured. However, we have to wait for a donor. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Good afternoon, Doctor. - I'm escorting my Boss's son. - Okay. Good afternoon, Doctor. Please have a seat. Your father had contacted me several months ago. - What took you so long? - What's important is I'm here, Doc. Yes, but your father has already... Uh, I'm sorry, Doctor, I'm not trying to be rude, but I don't think much of my father. Still, I trust his recommendations. Dr Haryadhi Kusumajati. Thank you, Mr Harun. Okay, it's like this. Your operation is actually simple. - However... - I understand. I'm used to waiting. It seems that you're not used to it. I heard the rustle of your coat. It's okay. I don't want to hold you for long. Okay. - Hi, Sweetheart. - Hi. Didn't I tell you? You need a lot of rest. I'm reading, Arie. Yes, but it's late. Rest now. Arie, this is unnecessary. I couldn't care less. Who's the doctor, huh? Yeah, but you're an eye doctor, not a general practitioner. Still, a doctor nonetheless. I know when it's best for you to sleep. Do you take me for a child? I am trying to be responsible. Now, have you revised your novel? You haven't, have you? Do you really think I'd let you drown in the sea again? I don't want to be an obstacle in your career, Arie. I love you more than my career. Then, let's go back to Indonesia and live peacefully there. Do you want that? Sure, why not? I'm not busy anyway. Got only one patient from Indonesia. A son of a diplomat from the Indonesian embassy, I suppose. Bona? Bona? Please, I beg you to forgive me. Please forgive me, Bona. Bona? Bona. Oh, thank you. Hello. Are you a nurse? Hello. Hello. I know you. I know you. Is there any news? This is the diagnosis report of Mr Harun Sutrisno. - Okay. - I don't understand... ... why his name is not featured in the waiting list. Exactly. I don't know either. What are you going to do if there's no cornea donor? Let me go... Uh, there's someone... - Doctor, there's someone... - Calm down, Sir. Calm down, Mr Harun. Someone I know. - Calm yourself down, Sir. - I... Let's go inside first. - I'm sorry, Doctor. - Yes. Go inside. Leave us alone. Mr Harun. I... have some news. And I'm sorry, but you have to go back home... ... until we can confirm your operation. If there is anything else I can do, don't hesitate to contact me. No, it's alright. I can still wait. Alright. Then, I'll call your father's adjutant. Uh, Doctor. Actually, there is something I wish for when my sight returns. Okay, what is it? I... I wish... I'm sure you can understand. I thought as much. Lately, you seem to be very enthusiastic about getting this operation done. It turns out, there's someone. How can I help you find her? Could it be... ... you have a name or a photograph? Bona. Sound of the birds... ... the sky, and even the sound of the small ants. If you let them be, they can bite. If wasn't for us, who would be your friends? - Go ahead. - Okay. Your world is too colourful, Arie. While your world and Harun's are the same, aren't they? I'm too scared to see the real world. I prefer to see the world that I created for myself. Harun joined me in it. Arie. - Mr Harun. - Yes Now, slowly. Open your eyes. Please cover your left eye. Can you see how many fingers I hold up? Two. Switch to your right eye. - Can you look at my finger? - Yes, I can. - How many fingers do I hold up? - Two. Thank you! Mr Harun. Congratulations! The surgery was a success. - Thank you, Doctor. - Yes. Please. This is the examination result. Thank you. Mr Harun... ... there's a price... ... for every dream. That's what I have been taught. For you... ... the price of getting your sight back... ... is that you have to bear the truth that I'm about to tell you. First... ... I'm Arie, the one who took Tiana away from you. Second... ... Tiana chose to leave both of us. I have to admit... ... that I love her too much. That's why I had to do this, Mr Harun. It's illegal. It's illegal, Mr Harun. What do you mean? Harun... ... maybe it's my curse to hurt everything I touch. Even Arie who I thought would be fine... ... because I tried to treat our relationship as casual as possible... ... eventually got hurt, too. However, I don't regret it, Harun. Because you taught me to see the world even in darkness. I found that... ... in this darkness, I can dive into my dreams and my world. Thank you for being with me when there was no light. I'm happy to have gone through everything that we've been through. It's like the warm hands of an old lady, where every wrinkle has a million of stories. Even in silence, the energy to create is abundant. I need that energy, Harun. Perhaps... ... we would eventually meet again in a city... ... called... ... memory.
