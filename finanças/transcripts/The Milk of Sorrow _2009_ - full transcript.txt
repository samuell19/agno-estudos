Perhaps, some day You will understand How much I cried I begged on my knees To those poor bastards That night, I screamed The hills echoed And people laughed I fought with my pain Saying A bitch with rabies Must have given birth to you And that is why You have eaten her breasts Now, you can swallow me Now, you can suck me Like you did to your mother This woman who sings Was grabbed was raped That night They didn't care About my unborn daughter They raped me With their penis and hands With no pity for my daughter Watching them from inside And not satisfied with that They made me swallow The dead penis Of my husband Josefo His poor dead penis Seasoned with gunpowder With that pain I screamed You better kill me And bury me with my Josefo I know nothing here Every time you remember When you cry, mother You stain your bed With tears of sorrow and sweat You haven't eaten anything If you don't want any, just tell me I won't prepare anything I'll eat, if you sing to me And freshen My drying memory I don't see my memories It's as if I no longer lived Come on. Sit up. You're worn out Like a dead bird I am going to make up Your bed a little Mom! Mom? THE MILK OF SORROW Hurry, or you'll be late. Jonathan, come help your sister. - Jonathan! - Coming! Can't you hear me? Jonathan, mama is calling you. What do you want? Help me with my veil. Take the tip, but carefully. Help your sister, carefully. Take care of this. Look dad, my veil is short. I want more material. More material? Who'll pay for it? You, dad. Aren't you my father? Okay, but I think it's too long. Dad, it's short. Can't you see it's short? Out! I think it looks fine. Jonathan, grab the tip. Look, you're getting it all dirty! - It's not that dirty. - Shake it! - It's not that dirty. - Shake it off, son. Dad, I want from two to three more meters. - It's huge! - How can it be huge? M醲ima, I have no material left. Mama, be quiet! I'm not talking to you. Get out of here kid. You won't be happy, until you finish staining my dress. But, baby, it's just fine You're exaggerating. - Dad, I'm your only daughter. - Okay, but... Besides, I'm only getting married once. I have no money, I've given it all to your mother. Fausta, it's short, isn't it? - It needs more material! - Try some ornaments. My veil Shit, mum! Baby it's long and pretty. Faustita, tell her it's okay. - Just talk, say something. - Faustita... Use more ornaments, that's all. - Shut up! - Faustita, are you okay? - Mum, Fausta is bleeding again! - You're bleeding! Fausta! Your full name? - Where is my uncle? - Your name, please. Fausta Isidora Janampa Chauca. Single? Yes. Virgin? I don't know. This has nothing to do with her bleeding or fainting. It's a rather strange, unusual case. I've seen similar cases... but in women older than Fausta... with a placenta previa. Which isn't Fausta's case. Fausta has a tuber in her vagina. A potato, to be exact. She hasn't let us treat her. She's rather upset. - Are you her husband? - I'm her uncle. You weren't aware, were you? She's bled since she was a child, when she's scared. Her mother, she just passed away. That's why she fainted. She lived very hard times in the village. Fausta was born during terrorism. And her mother transmitted her fear through her breast milk. The "milk of sorrow", as we call anyone born that way, without a soul... because it hid underground out of fear. There is no illness like this in Lima, is there, doctor? Did you know your niece had a potato in her vagina? No, I didn't know about that. It must have gotten in there by itself. There's lots of food at home. Fausta's uterus is inflamed. That is dangerous because she could have more infections. Evidently, as the potato grows, the bacteria will increase. What do you mean by growing, doctor? Have you seen a potato saved for a long time? It's the same, the roots protrude from the vaginal area. The bleeding isn't related. Her capillary vessels are very superficial. With a simple operation they are cauterized and that's the end of it. She bleeds because of the illness, because of the "milk of sorrow". She was born that way, no potatoes. How can we harvest potatoes from a vagina? The illness of the "milk of sorrow", or whatever, doesn't exist. And much less transmitted by a mother's milk. Here is a document so as to have her admitted. Later, we can talk about a real contraceptive. Thank you, doctor. Uncle, that doctor knows nothing. It's not a birth control method, I know that I am not ignorant. I'd prefer that. Don't tell my aunt, if she won't understand it. And you must respect me. Mum told me that during the terrorism... a neighbour did it so as not to be raped. They say it was disgusting. I thought she was the smartest. Then, she got married, had four kids... and didn't have to live with a rapist. These are other times. In Lima it's different. Things have changed. No one will hurt you. You came to Lima very young. - Mum told me everything! - Your mother is dead, dead! My uncle doesn't understand me, mum This is my protection I saw it all from your belly I felt the slashing of your body This is why I now wear this Like a coat of arms Like a stopper Because only revulsion stops revolting people Uncle? I have to take her to the village. With what money? Don't you worry, uncle. I must wash your clothes well You won't get back To the village With me Smelling of sadness The contract includes all services. Coffin, chapel, and carriage for 600 soles. That's the best I can do. The coffin comes with the ornaments. We want the coffin and carriage, but in the province. To the province? That will cost you. The coffin, carriage and paperwork. 800 soles complete. Not even if it were a limousine. Brother, this is a first-rate service I am offering you. Look at the coffin and the ornaments. You can see the finish on it. This is the Imperial model. Besides, I'm the owner here. Here's my card. But you cannot have it. It's the last one I have. Now, it's up to you. Come this way. We have more coffins. This one is for fanatics. For sportsmen. For patriots. "For God and the country." This one's for those who miss the land. Look, pure oak. Some bring a picture of their loved one so as to be together. And that one is for peace. It's the Pacific ocean that lightens their loads and washes their sorrow. That's hot, papi! That's great for when I die. How much? 500 soles each. It's all handmade. But figure about 700 for any special job. I remember once my sister-in-law took her father on the state bus. She put the box with the luggage. Maybe you can too. Or I can rent you a grave for one night. We can remove her the next day and you find a cheaper place. Ask Jonathan to fix your hairdo for the weeding. Big buns are in style. That puts years on you. I want my hair loose, like Thalia. In the novel, she finally wears a bun. Beautiful. Like a wild rose. Did it make her look older? - I don't like it, mom - I'm just saying. Mum, what if Zonia is written with an "S"? - What will the client say? - She can't read. It's getting away, mum It's getting away Be careful! Get that pigeon, please. They got away! Severina, pass me the oil, and don't burn yourself. - This is making me sick. - Sick or not sick. We've helped so many preserve their dead. How could we prove their existence? We didn't even have a picture, or an ID card. We had no proof of being born... and much less of being killed. Go over her breast. I don't want to be infected by her nipple. They're looking for someone for the Big House. Nights only. You could go, make money and take your mom to the village. I could ask my comadre for an advance. But you will have to go alone. What do you say? Are you sure? She never goes anywhere alone. I accept, auntie. Okay, honey, you needed that, didn't you? Where are you going? I am going to Heaven To pick flowers To pick flowers Where are you going? I am going to Heaven To pick flowers To pick flowers Where are you going? I am going to heaven To pick flowers To pick flowers Don't worry, Fina is my friend and she will help you. I'm going to prepare the Carvajal's wedding. Hi, comadre, I'm glad you're here. I was waiting. You're a bit late. Come in, Fausta, come in. Come in, dear. I'm sorry about your mum. I'm having bad luck too. But, that's life, dear. I forgot. God Heavens Mrs. Aida says there is no advance. She doesn't usually do these things. There's no way. And as I was saying, my son is in jail. Can you imagine? I hope he doesn't get raped in prison. But he must have done something to have these problems. What a shame He says no, but he must have done something. He can't tell me he didn't! What do they think? Now, I have to take care of my grandchildren at night. Why must I be in this situation? You can leave at seven o'clock. The gardener comes before you leave, he is no. Before opening the door, ask if it's him. If it isn't, please don't open the door for anyone else. I recommend staying inside the house... because delinquency is terrible right now. And if you open the door, they could empty the house. Hurry up, dear, hurry up. Hurry! Let's see those ears. That's okay. Now your mouth. Show me your teeth, please. Let's see those teeth. And that neck. You're pretty sweaty. You'll have to have a bath anyway. Show me your hands. Spread your fingers, please. Well, they're clean. Your other hand. Here you have a long fingernail. Why? What happened? Why didn't you cut it? You should know that for these things... Mrs. Aida could lose interest. Here is your uniform. You've got soap, scissors for you fingernails, shampoo... and deodorant, which is obligatory daily, after your bath. She gives you mimosas because she's very good. After your bath, you'll wait in the kitchen. If she needs you, she'll call. If she doesn't, just stay in your kitchen. Fina. Fina? Finita, take this. - My name is Fausta. - What? Fausta Isidora. Mrs. Fina told me... Yes, now I remember. Hand me that picture. Let's sing, let's sing We must sing pretty things To hide our fear, pretend it doesn't exist Let's sing, let's sing We must sing pretty things To hide our fear Conceal our wound Pretend it doesn't exist Who is it? Me. Me, who? No, the gardener. Let me see your hands. Long life to the bride and groom Viva! Smile, you're not dead. They think they're committing suicide. Bravo, bravo! The kiss, the kiss! The kiss. Is there no kiss? The kiss! Everyone applaud, this isn't a cemetery. Let them dance. Music, please. These are the newlyweds. Very close together. Smile Hector and Hermelinda. Cheese One, two, three, the picture! Here we go. Have the bride's family come in. Smile, everyone. Stay close together. Ready? Cheese! One, two, three... picture! Now the groom's family. Get close together. The groom's family, please. Everyone smiling. That's it. Are you all ready? Stay near the newlyweds. Cheese! One, two, three... picture Hello, hello. Testing, one, two three. Be careful, don't trip. - Where is the buffet going? - It's only a mobile buffet. They have left only chips. This is the highlight of "Bodas Chic". We do wonderful, quality weddings... within your budgets. The groom should be more cheerful. Now, with your cousins. Now with your cousins. Now with the old folk. Now with the old folk. Did you get the advance at the Big House? At the end of the month, she said. I want no dead people... or sad memories at M醲ima's wedding. You must take Perpetua away before the wedding. If not, I'll bury her myself. Understand? Round trip? What dates? Give me the price for a package and my return trip. - How many people? - One, sir. - And a coffin. - What? A coffin? - You had to tell him. - Are you pulling my leg? It's a package, sir. You've got a donkey there for that. Just get on it. Move on. Next Name? Wait, can't you see I'm gestating? I've had to buy a new piano. And the other one? Did it fall out the window by itself? Yes. Mum, you left me four messages saying... the premiere is in a week and you have nothing. Now, I'm here, and you act like everything is fine. You worry me. Don't worry. There's nothing you can do. That's normal. What do you think? Isidra, leave it right there. They're cold. I'll do it. Sit down. You were singing a song yesterday. Sing it again. I heard you, don't be shy. I can't, Madam. Right. Bring it to my room. Isidra, come help me. My necklace has broken. If you sing, I'll give you a pearl. If you complete the necklace, it's yours. Who is it? The piano fell. It's broken, but it still sings. Can't you hear it? And these look like colored sweets. It's whole and very thin. It will be a long life full of love and hope. Well, today I will speak in the name of my cousin Marcos, Don L鷆ido. With this act... we've confirmed that M醲ima is worthy of marriage... and that was a gnarled and very difficult potato, sir. We wanted to ask for your permission. We have a date for the church. Perhaps you could lend us something... a little economic help to carry it out. And your roof for us to build our home, Don L鷆ido. You will no longer have to take care of M醲ima. My maximum love. Well, those are the sincere wishes... of my beloved cousin Marcos, Don L鷆ido. Bravo! Listen, your cousin is hot. Didn't I tell you she's ill? She's got the tit illness. They look fine to me. You're crazy. - Can I sit down? - Sure, sit down. I'm going for milk. I bet many guys flirt with you. Yeah, I'm sure. Maybe something like this: "you're a nice piece. If red is the color of passion, bathe me in your menstruation". Just call me and I'll kick their asses. Just let me know. I'm watering the garden again. That calms me down. No. I've done that concert for 20 years and I won't miss it. Not even stark raving mad. I'll show up, even just to play the Funeral March. Yes. Wednesday. Right. Now what? 900 soles, Madam. You must be out of your mind How can you charge that? I'll never call you again, you're too expensive. The job is worth that. Too expensive. Impossible, I can't. I'll stay several days, until the job is done. An optimum job, first-rate materials... at a special price for you. I only have 700. Since you always hire me, Madam, 750 soles. I'll be right back. Isidra, is that your name? Don't bother the girl. Let's get to work. Hi, Faustita. M醲ima sent me to pick you up. She didn't tell me. M醲ima is "busy" with Marcos. And since you don't like to walk alone, I volunteered. - That's what friends are for. - I'll wait here. Faustita, did you make me come on a whim? I'll wait. - Good morning. - Good morning. You'll have to go back all alone. Could I have a glass of water? I'll take you home. - Take me where? - To home. No, I'm fine. In my village... you have to walk very close to the wall. If not, you get caught by the lost souls and could die. My brother died of that. He was as thin as a skeleton... for not paying attention to the lost souls. He had terrible stomach aches. Mum was on the farm. And grandfather in town, selling animals. Now we only have a picture of his stomach. That's all we have left. An X-ray? Yes, that's it. We're almost at my place. It's there, on the corner. I'll stay here. But I'll be watching until you get there. Auntie! Auntie! A swimming pool! Let's see if they recognize you When we reach the village I will carry you on my back Like you did, When I was a baby My daddy will no longer be alone with the maggots In my village, They say that musicians Have a secret contract With a mermaid For their music To be heard more than always If they want to know How long the agreement lasts From a dark field They must pick Handfull of quinine To the mermaid they must give So she starts counting Until it lasts They say each grain Means a year So, when the mermaid Finishes counting She takes the musician and Through him to the sea But my mother says, says, says Quinine grains Are too difficult to count And the mermaid gets worn out So the musician can, Forever Can embrace their gift - You need comforting. - Why? There's geraniums, hydrangea, jasmin, and you pick daisies. Plants tell the truth. They're not like people. At the stems you can read everything. Its life and memories. The Earth must be stirred from top to bottom... so the sun doesn't always burn the same layer. If not, you get a crust... and the plant dries quickly. I know that. I had a small vegetable garden in my village. My little Lost dove You ran away out of fear And you lost your soul Little dove I'm sure your mother Brought you Into the world during the war And, perhaps, your mother Gave birth to you with fear Even if they hurt you there You shouldn't walk crying There's no reason To walk suffering Search for, look for Your lost soul Look for it in the darkness look for it in the earth Little birds, little birds Not this one, sing the mermaid one! I can't remember. I make them up. Make it up again, but exactly the same. A mermaid From a dark field You must pick A handful of quinine For the mermaid And so the mermaid Counts it all The mermaid says That each grain What is this? This was my doll. They said that, if I buried it... the earth would take it away and I'd never find it again. Liars. I brought you a present. There are geraniums, camellias, daisies... cactus, sweet potatoes, everything but potatoes. Why are you afraid to walk alone on the street? Because I have. Me too, because I want to. I'm not afraid because I want to. Only death is obligatory. The rest is because we want to. And when they kill you or rape you? That's not obligatory! Potatoes are cheap... and flourish very little. All brides stand up, please. - Do you all accept your husbands? - Yes, we do. Now, all grooms stand up, please. - Do you all accept your brides? - Yes, we do. Everyone stand up, please. Grooms, you may now kiss your brides. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the highlight of the celebration. The families of the grooms have saved up all year... to give them a great gift. Let's receive, with a round of applause... those guinea pigs so that the couples may eat. And here come the rest of the gifts Let's see! There is also a beautiful painting of the Sacred Heart. What beautiful gifts for the happiness of the home. What great gifts! Wonderful beer, to cheer up the attendants. This beautiful sofa... For the bride to sit down... while happily watching their TV. Welcome to that bed! The bed of love! For the enjoyment of the bride and groom. And there are the chickens, for them to have eggs at home. And those great gifts, as well. That beautiful mirror for the bride to look at herself. And that ironing board this is wonderful! And the cradle, ready for the baby. And this bird, to cheer their home up. Thank you, family! Thanks for so many gifts! Let's have them kiss once again. Congratulations and thank you, family! What a wonderful family, thank you! Thank you so much! - Feeling better? - Yes, uncle. Melvin's taking you to the doctor. How much did your earrings costs? - What? - How much did your earrings cost? My grandma gave them to me before dying. - They're pretty. - I like them too. - And where did you buy your pants? - In the market. - For how much? - Twelve soles. - Did you buy your sandals there? - What? - At the market too? - No, at a store. - And for how much? - Twenty three soles. - They look comfortable. - And they are. I'd like to buy a pair, but... Your report number? Where is your report? Didn't you get a paper for admittance? Or a number for your first visit? Have you come before? Yes, doctor, but I didn't bring... What have you got so I can find your case history? I don't want to be rude, but we attend over 80 cases a day. We're tired and short staffed. Look at the line. Go get the report, come back tomorrow and we won't waste time. Next! You are ill as well Here. So you won't follow me. Look. This is arrived. Thanks a lot, Barbarita, thanks a lot. Yes, I'm happy, very happy. Okay, whenever you want. All my love. Ciao. - Won't you say anything? - Congratulations, it was great. All of Lima was there. They really liked it, didn't they? Isidra gets off here. She's walking. - At the corner? - Yes, drop her off. What can I do here? My pearls, my pearls? We made a deal? Stop, Mrs. Aida? I went to volleyball the other day... Jonathan Take care of your sister. Jonathan, take care of your sister, boy Can't you see she's nervous? Take care of her. Speaking about volleyball... I've been invited to a championship. - Will you go? - Sure we go. Grandma, say "hello" to the camera. Say a few words. Marcos, I love you. You better love me as much as I love you. They're going to brush the cat's fur. - He'll look great for the wedding. - I should skin it. Uncle, I tried to take her to the village but I couldn't. Forgive me, uncle. Please. Mum, my train doesn't fly. Relax, M醲ima. Give me a hand. It does fly! - How could you put balloons there? - M醲ima, please relax. It should fly like the angels! Marcos is waiting for you. Come on. You're so whimsical. Come on. - I won't go up until it flies - Come on, rise. No, not till it flies. M醲ima, people are waiting. Be careful, M醲ima, please. Slowly, slowly. Come. Give me your hand. Give me your hand. - I don't want to. - Give me your hand. - I said I don't want to. - I'll help you. M醲ima, don't be so whimsical. M醲ima! M醲ima, slowly, easy. Ladies and gentlemen, the first picture. Say "ex"? That's it? Now for the second picture, friends. Love is so beautiful? Say "ex"? That's it? The third picture, just like Romeo and Juliet. Say "ex". Look at the camera. That's it? And now all relatives. A beautiful family. - Mum, on this side. - Hurry, cousin A family united by the love between M醲ima and Marcos? Hold still a moment, just a moment. Just a bit more. Now look at the camera and say "ex". That's it? How nice. Now we're done. Now let's get to the banquet, ladies and gentlemen. To the banquet? Today is a very special day. Love has blessed us. And now, they are also surrounded by the love of our beloved family. Thank you for coming. These were hard times for the family... but life goes on and is renewed with new happiness. Today, we celebrate life that, despite everything... always has beautiful surprises full of happiness. We will dance and eat till dawn... because this banquet today is going nowhere. It is my gift. See how you breathe? You want to live, but you don't dare. Let go, uncle! Breathe! Fausta, don't leave! Fausta, don't go Fausta! Have it removed. Please! Get it removed from inside me! Get it removed from me! Removed... Remove it from me! Remove it from me! Remove it from me! - Emergencies, sir, please. - The 2nd door. Relatives offers Ala! Relatives of Meza Ala! The doctor said you didn't open your hand during the operation. Uncle, stop Uncle, stop! Uncle! Look at the sea, mum Look at the sea No, not like that. You have to stomp your feet hard. That's it. Fausta, someone is calling you!
