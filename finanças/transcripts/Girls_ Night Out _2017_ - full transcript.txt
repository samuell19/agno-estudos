music) So, go ahead. Tell the truth. Tell people what really happened that night. You poured me a glass of scotch... (sirens) Where are we going? I told you it was a surprise. - I hate surprises. You were surprised when I proposed. That's what you think. - Seriously? How did you know? Whenever you're nervous about something, you do this twitchy thing with your eyebrow. Wha-what, like a tic? - Sort of. If you would take the blindfold off, I could demonstrate. Oh, nice try! - I think it's adorable. It's like you have a built-in lie detector. Aw, I'm never gonna be able to get away with anything with you. - Nope! You're a terrible liar, and I love you for it. I'm pretty sure my eyeballs are sweating. - A couple more minutes. Though the blindfold is pretty sexy. If this was just a ploy to get me to wear a blindfold, you're in trouble. (beeping) - Oh! It's go time! The anticipation's killing me! - Trust me, you're gonna love it. Two... - How many total? ...three, four... five. There's six total, so number six and you're good. - I made it? OK... OK. Hold tight, hold tight. - I'm holding. Oh man... - Psi Beta Kappa Pi surprise! Oh my God! What are you doing here? You cannot invite us to your wedding and then tell us not to throw you a bachelorette party. - We were forced to surprise you with one instead. - How long did you know about this? - Oh, about a month. No twitch? I'm very impressed. - I tracked him down through Facebook. I'm Joelle, by the way. It's nice to officially meet you. I'm sorry! Reese, these are my very best friends from college. It's Joelle, Rebecca and Sadie. Great to finally meet you all! - You too! - Oh my God! This thing is like wearing a Tesla on your finger! It's his grandmother's diamond, but he picked out the setting himself. - I officially grant you permission to marry this woman. And to provide dates for all of her friends. Uh, when was the last time you were all together? God, at least four years now. - It wasn't that long. Yes, it was New Year's Eve 2013 in Vegas. How could I forget that? - The only thing McKenzie tells me about college is that it was a crazy blur. Well, that might have something to do with her "Special K" brownies. Oh! So, you're a baker! - Was! Past life. I think there's a Cubs game you're missing... No, I wanna hear more about this Special K. Another time! - It was nice meeting you all. - You too! Be right back. Thank you so much for this. I'm just glad I finally got to meet your friends. They seem great. - Yeah, we had some crazy times together. I don't wanna know, do I? - I'll call you later. - No, don't worry about it. Just focus on having a good time tonight. Not too good. I love you like crazy. - I love you too. OK, OK! Enough of that! Let's go! We promise to take really good care of her tonight. Come on! - Bye! - (all): Bye! (squealing and giggling) (whooping) Pure modesty? - I don't know. Maybe. Thongs, in general. - Just in the front. Maybe if you're shy in the front. Right up your butt! - Just only in the front. - Only in the front. I feel really good about the back, though. - It's coming off anyway. OK. My turn. Wow! - For you. - Nice wrapping job, Martha Stewart. - Saving the best for last. - OK. Oh my God! - Whoo! - Naughty Martha! Whoa! - I'm sorry. I had to. I couldn't resist. OK, I would like to propose a toast. Oh! - To Kenzie, the first Psi Beta to get hitched. Hmm! - To Kenzie! - Thank you, guys. Oh, you know, and I would like to propose a toast to Joelle, who organized this entire night and got the gang all back together again. Thank you, Joe. - I couldn't let you get away that easily. What about you, Kenz? You still writing? - Sort of, if writing about razor blades counts. - Oh no! See, I always thought you would be off somewhere really exotic like Uganda, writing about the refugee crisis. Well, the world seems more interested in hearing about a revolutionary close shave with virtually no missed hairs. - Well, you always were a great writer. - Well, never let a man distract you from your dreams. What are you talking about? - I'm talking about Reese. As soon as you met the man, you completely disappeared! That's not true! - Come on. Well, we had to find out through Facebook that you were engaged, and then we all got some random e-vite to your wedding along with 500 people I've never even heard of. - OK, that part is true. You know what? I think she's just a little bit embarrassed by us. What? - I'm sorry! I'm sorry! You're right. I should've called. OK, well, we're all here now, right? That's what matters. For what it's worth, it feels like no time has passed. Cheers to that. - Yes. - Someone fire the bartender... All right, all right! - ...this glass is empty. Typical Sadie! ...right full to the brim. Oh, more! - What? OK! - Cheers! I'm gonna go to the bathroom. - OK! Should we sit? - Whoo! - Let's sit. We shall sit. - We should drink! (ringing) - [Hey, babe!] - Reese! - [You sound like you're in a submarine. ] - Uh, it feels like it, sort of. - [Everything OK?] - Yeah! I just- I needed to hear your voice. - [You know, I'm happy to strap on my finest pair of stilettos and join you ladies, ] [but I'm not sure your friends would like that.] - Probably not. I miss you like crazy. - [I miss you too. ] Bye, babe. You think she's doing OK? She seems great! - I think she's telling herself she's great. Wait. I'm sorry. Are you a surgeon or a psychiatrist? What? I didn't say there was anything wrong with it. It's what we'd all do. We really shouldn't be talking about this right now. - Well, does anyone even know where he is? Let me guess. Brandon? Sorry. - It's been 9 years. - I know! I just wish the monster was behind bars right now. Well, at least he never made it to the NHL. - He ever try to contact you? Just once. When he found out I was engaged, he sent two dozen white roses. Jesus! That's creepy. - Yeah. - What? What did you do? I threw them out and got another restraining order against him. You know, there's a 10-year statute of limitations on rape. Here we go. - It was obvious you didn't get a fair trial. You could easily go back and refile. - And go through hell again? - I just think a judge today would see things very differently. - Yeah, he'd get six months in a county jail and then go on a national tour speaking out against the consequences of too much drinking. I've moved on, Rebecca. You should too. It's over. OK. You're right. I'm sorry. - OK, enough about the past. - Yes! - This night is about celebrating the future. - Whoo-hoo! - I'll drink to that! Stand up! You get this. - Wow! Whoo-hoo! - Sexy! And you're also... - Oh! ...wearing this. - Glorious. Beautiful. Bride's last ride. I look like I'm dressed for a wedding and a funeral. Oh, well, you know what they say. Till death do us part! - Yes! Drink up, ladies! - (all): Cheers! Oh... really gross. Wait, wait! Hold on! Where's my phone? We need a selfie. Get over here! - Oh! I'm not ready. - I know! Ready? OK, let's go! We're wasting so much time! - Sadie, will you grab my purse? Yes. Let's go! - Whoo! Let's do this. Whoo! Don't fall out! I think that the worst, the worst was when they made us eat dog food. - No! - No, wait, wait, wait! What about urinal cake pops? - No! I cannot hear that without wanting to throw up. How do I not remember that? - Um, probably because McKenzie over here stepped it up and licked your cake pop when you were too freaked out to do it. Excuse me! I'm- I'm sure that's true. You were always the nice one! - I'm not that nice. Just until she gets a couple drinks in her and then it's... - Yes, yes, yes! Like Daytona. - No! Oh my God! Don't bring that up. - I'm sorry. - I think some things are better left in the past! - OK, hold up. But serious question for a second. Do you think that if we hadn't been forced to eat dog food together, would we be as close as we are now? - Hundred percent! - Really? Yeah! Pledges today don't have to do half the crap we did back then. It's true. - It is not what you eat. It is who you eat it with. - Yes! - I will drink to that. Cheers! - Whoo! - Wait, wait, wait, wait! Excuse me! - Aw, come on! Oh, "wish you were here" with a... one, two, three, seven heart emojis! - I'm sorry! I don't know what that means! - I will stop. - Really? Will you? I don't think so, so here you go! - All mine! OK, listen, this is the first night in, like, years that I haven't had to deal with some gruesome medical emergency, so we are going all out. Deal? Deal, whatever that means. - Last night of freedom, baby. Fianc√©-free night, baby! (pop song) Keep your eyes closed. No peeking! - I can't see anything. OK. We got you! - We got you! Step up and down. - OK. Keep your eyes closed. - They're closed! No peeking! - I am not. I'm too afraid. - All right. You ready? Mm-hmm. - Open! Lumberjacks? Are you serious? - We figured it was our duty to give back to the only establishment on the North Side that would serve us when we were underage. - Yes, that is... This was your idea. All right, wait. Let's take a picture. Picture, picture, picture! More like blackmail time. - Cheese! Cute! - OK! Can we go? All right, wait! Let me post, then we go. Let me post it! - Posting... Done! - Yes! - You can go. (crowd cheering) (dance music) Ah, divorce party, ladies. That's our future! - I should give them my business card. Kenzie, do it! - (all): Do it! Where's the bathroom? - It's in the back. My turn! Whoo! Whoo-hoo! (music fades out) (whooping and cheering) (soft ballad) (cheering) - (all): Cheers! - Oh my God! - Oh, McKenzie. Happy birthday. (cheering) (whooping) (cheering) - What's wrong? - Oh, not--nothing. I just got a weird chill. - Well, that's because you're getting married! Whoo! (whooping) (blues music) (cell phone buzzing) - Just scotch and water, please. - If you like scotch, you should try Glen Gailey. It's blended, but it's a good bang for the buck. - Thanks! Uh, Glen Gailey and water, please. - Another. Cheers. - Oh, cheers! - You know, if you're a real scotch drinker, you should try McGinty's on Clinton Street. - Oh, I go there all the time. - Maybe that's why you look familiar. - Every Friday night after work. It's expensive as hell, but, uh, best variety of single malt in the city. - Yeah, hands down. So, what are you doing here? - Oh, my fianc√©e and some friends from college are having a bachelorette party tonight, and they wanted me to join them for a drink. - That's kind of weird and kind of awesome. (laughing) - I know, right? - Are her friends hot? - Yeah. Not as hot as my fianc√©e, of course. - Of course. So, what do you think? - Yeah, it's nice. It's big with a mellow peat finish. There's a hint of pipe in there. - Just like Grandpa's ashtray. - Like Grandpa's ashtray. I love it. Do you know where the bathroom is in here? - Yeah, it's just, uh, straight back and on the right. I'll, uh, get us another round. - Thanks! - Another round. - I haven't smoked since college. - Whatever, Special K. - Oh, it's true. I'm practically an old, married woman now. - Well, that's true. (coughing) - I get to live vicariously through you. - What are you talking about? - I've seen your Instagram. You're always flying first class on business trips, posting pictures of amazing white sand beaches, meeting gorgeous men. - That's my Instagram life. Life of a nine-to-five banking executive is really not that exciting. - What about that hockey player from Colorado? He was cute. - He was cute. He was also into my dental hygienist. - No! - Yeah. - Oh, I'm sorry. - My mother always said: "Never settle for being someone's other when you know you have the potential to be someone's only." - I agree. - You never had to deal with that! Guys were always choosing you. - That's not true. - Oh, come on! All those guys, Butch, Mike, Davey, they were all crushing over you. - Yeah, I didn't always make the right choice. - So, how do you know Reese is the one? - It's hard to explain. It was just this feeling I got, like nothing else mattered, you know? - Yeah, I get it. - I really think there's someone for everyone. - Ha! That's just the weed talking. Always brings out the Cinderella story. (laughing) - What do they say? If the slipper fits... - Oh yes, but would you cut off your right toe to make it fit? - All depends if I could still get a pedicure. (laughing) - True that! - Done. - Yeah. - The tablecloths are periwinkle and they sort of match the hydrangeas, but not too matchy-matchy. - Matchy-matchy's bad? - Yeah, very bad. - What the hell's a hydrangea? - I have no idea. (chuckling) What about yourself? Any hydrangeas in your future? - Yeah, I was in love once, but it ended badly. - Oh, sorry, man. - It's a long story, a big misunderstanding. I hate to admit it, but I blame her friends. - Really? - Mm-hmm. If it weren't for them, we'd probably be married by now. - It's getting late. I guess they're a no-show. - That's a shame. I was hoping to get lucky. (chuckling) Hey! Take it easy. - Driving is definitely not happening. I should just call a cab. - Where you headed? - North shore. - I'm driving that way. I can give you a lift. - You sure, man? - Positive. Wanna make sure you get home OK. (pop music, cheering) - (slurring): I am now an official member of the Chicago Fire Department! - Whoo! - Only you, Sadie! Only you! - You see how much fun you're missing with that ginormous ring on your finger? - OK, OK! - It's pretty good, right? - Let's show 'em how it's done. Whoo! (whooping) - OK, I may be super wasted, but I'm almost positive this is not my house. - It is now. - Dude, it's-- it's OK, I'll just take a cab. (RnB music) (cheering) - Let's get you another drink. - I love you, Joe, but I... cannot do it. Just water. - I know. That's weird. - What? - It's a picture of you dancing, but it's from your phone. Now it's a picture of all of us. - What? (phone ringing) Hello? - You're still using your birthday as your password. I figured you would've changed that by now. Just wanted to call and congratulate you on your upcoming wedding. - How did you get my phone? - [It's nice to hear your voice too.] - Where the hell are you? - What's wrong with her? - She got a weird phone call. - I see the old gang's back together again. I recognize Joelle and Sadie, but what's the third one's name again? It's, um... Rebecca. [I always liked Rebecca. Too bad she never liked me.] - What do you want, Brandon? - Well, I wanna join in the fun, but I was thinking we could play a different kind of bachelorette party game. - [I'm not playing games.] - Oh, I think you're gonna wanna play this one. (phone chiming) [Did you get it?] It's a game called Save the Groom. I took a page out of my fraternity's hazing playbook, and the rules are simple. You involve the police, Reese dies. If anyone quits along the way or doesn't do exactly as they're told, well, then, Reese dies. - Brandon, please! You don't wanna do this. - Get your friends and go to the alley outside the club. I'll call back in five. (RnB music) - Hey! What's going on? - He's back. - We need to call the cops. - He specifically said no cops. - So, what, he's just been stalking us the whole night? - I thought he was in Florida! - That's what I thought too! - Wait, how often did you post? - I don't know! I--I--I just wanted to document the night. - What are your Instagram settings? - I have 435 followers. - Gimme your phone. Your settings are open, which means everyone can see, and you were snapping selfies every two seconds. It's how he knew exactly where we were. - My God! - I'm sorry, guys! - It's not her fault. It's me he's after. (phone ringing) - Wow! Been a long time, Kenz. [You still look beautiful as ever.] - Hi, Brandon! It's Rebecca. You remember me? First degree or aggravated kidnapping carries a minimum sentence of 20 years. You don't wanna do this. - Yeah, I heard there was a lawyer in the house. Why don't you tell me what the maximum sentence for murder is? - Brandon, come on! - [This is crazy! We can sit down] [just the two of us and work this out.] - Oh, really? Like you said we would sit down before you came up with all those lies about me? - I'm not doing this. Forget it! - What, you think this is a joke? - [I know you're not going to hurt him.] - Really? Sorry, buddy. Need to let your bride-to-be know this is serious. Watching? Yeah, a wedding ring is a pain in the ass to wear around all day. This way, you'll have the perfect excuse. - Brandon, this isn't you. - I guess you don't know me as well as you thought. (screaming in pain) - Oh my God! (screaming) - I trust now I have everyone's attention. - Why are you doing this? - It was your friends' idea to come forward, wasn't it? You were all in on it, playing me, humiliating me, destroying my reputation. [Well, you do what I say this time, and then we'll be square.] [Do we understand each other?] - Yes. - Yeah, I wasn't sure how well your friends knew Reese here, so just in case they need a little extra incentive to participate, I got my hands on something that's just begging to be released. [Psi Beta Kappa Pi] [Spring Break in Daytona 2005.] - Oh my God, you guys! - What? How the hell did you get that? - I'm sure just all your employers and current boyfriends would just love to know how much blow and sex you had back in the day. Joelle and Kenzie are on Team One. Rebecca, Sadie, you're on Team Two. There's a total of 8 tasks that need to be completed by sunrise. Reese's Pieces and I will be keeping score. I'll text or call you instructions along the way and give you a set amount of time to complete each task. Now, if a task is not completed in the given amount of time, well, then, Reese's here will suffer the consequences. [No phone a friend, no phone a cop. No phone] a friend to phone a cop. Are we clear? I said are we clear? - [Yes.] - Sunrise is at 5:44 a.m. Let the games begin. - Kenzie, look at me. We're gonna get him back, OK? I promise. (phone chiming) - "Dumpster diving." (phone chiming) - "Hospital morgue." He's--he's giving us 20 minutes. - Guys, we gotta go. - OK, let's go. Let's go! - This is so messed up! How the hell are we supposed to find a used condom and chicken wings? - It's Lumberjacks. I'm sure they hand out condoms like candy. - Yeah, but does anyone use them? - Oh God! Ugh! Apparently so! - Ugh! - You know, this is like college all over again. - What are you talking about? - You don't remember half-price wing night at Timmy's? Last person to finish their beer ended up in the dumpster. - We dated for almost three years and I barely remember anything about that time. - Well, the brain does that. It's called survival. - Here's to survival. - Texting of our photos with two minutes to spare. - Of course! It's like cadaver crawl during hell week. - It makes a twisted kind of sense. I mean, in his mind, if it weren't for us, she wouldn't have come forward. He wants us to suffer just as much as she is. - Ugh! - What are you doing? - Here, put this on! - I am a germaphobe, Sadie! - Right now, you are a medical professional who has about 13 minutes to do exactly what he's asking. - Oh God! It's so disgusting! OK! - OK! Go! - (Brandon): Frat brothers always said you were stiff in bed. Time to let loose and kiss the dead. Male or female, whatever your pleasure. - This way. - Be sure to bring it in plain view and film it for good measure. - Oh, twisted son of a bitch! - They keep them in here. - We're going to catch something. - I'm sure a frozen corpse is a lot more sanitary than most guys we slept with in college. - Speak for yourself! - OK! So, not that one. - Oh! This is so illegal! - Well, if we get caught, I know a great lawyer. - That's not funny. - We have no time! Just help me push, OK? - OK! - OK. - Oh my God! - OK, start filming. (beep) Your turn. - I can't! - Just pretend it's a popsicle. - OK, yeah, um, lime or cherry? - We literally have two minutes, Rebecca. Gimme the phone! (whimpering) (loud clanking) Go, go, go, go, go! - OK. OK. Oh! - Hey! Hey, you two, stop! Get back here! - OK. OK. Sent! He wants us to go to the 8000 block of Western. - In Englewood? - He wants us to take a cab back to the hotel. - How long is he giving us? - 20 minutes. There's a cab. Let's go. (phone chiming) - (Brandon): Roses are red, violets are blue. Every time I go to bed, I still think of you. I wanted to send you something to help you remember the magical life we had together. (phone ringing inside) - Open it. - Oh-ho-ho! You answered just in time. I was about to hang up. I have another trivia question for you. [What colour of lingerie did I buy you] [on our 18-month anniversary?] - 18 months? - [We celebrated every month.] It was late September, Indian summer? - Brandon, please, I don't remember. - Oh. You don't remember? Or you choose not to remember? (muffled groans) - Purple? - Why don't you open that present I left you? - No! No! - It might help jog your memory. - No! - I was right. - Hey, attagirl! Amazing what you can remember [when you put your mind to it.] - Brandon, what do you want? - I wanna see that beautiful body of yours again, see if it's held up after all these years. - You're sick, you know that? - [No, no. You know what's sick? When you] and your sorority sisters lined up all the pledges, stripped them down and then made them [circle their physical flaws with a Sharpie.] - I never did that. - [No, but you watched it being done, and you didn't say a word about it.] Now, I get to be the judge. Joelle can circle anything she doesn't feel is up to snuff. Show starts in three minutes. - What? What'd he say? - Remember the hazing ritual Flaw Finder? - Yeah. - I'm it. (sensual music) - Ah... Dude, you still got eyes. Come on. You gotta see this. Looks even better than she did in college. [Run the camera slowly up and down her body.] Yeah. That's it. What do you think, Joelle? - I can't. - Just do it. - d I can't feel inside d - [Was that a thigh?] [It's kind of hard to tell from this angle.] - Yes. - [Keep going.] Someone needs to get back to Pilates, huh? - OK, I'm so sorry. - I remember you complaining about inheriting your grandma's knobby knees. - I'm done. - Uh, I think you missed a spot. - Where? - Birthmark on her back. Right? - d Can you feel what I feel tonight d - Yeah, we used to joke that it looked like a miniature State of California. Remember that, Kenzie? [When we talked about building a life together someday.] Mmm! Well, you better get dressed, baby. [Cover up those thighs.] - d Baby d - My God, I am so sorry. - d Baby, you are d Oh! What's the matter, Reese? Didn't realize that your fianc√©e was such a slut? (grunting) Hey, easy. This is just the beginning. Night's still young. (sniffling) - You OK? - Yeah, I'm great. - I'm sorry, of course you're not. I just-- - What? Everything's gonna be OK? - No, I wasn't gonna say that. - Because it's not enough for you to draw circles around my cellulite while my sociopathic ex-boyfriend chimes in. You also have to lie to me. - Right now, I have to believe it's gonna be OK just as much as you do. - It's the bar where we first met. - The sorority scavenger hunt. "Kiss a stranger, pick him up." - "Then all year, you'll have good luck." - I'm guessing he was the stranger you picked. - Lucky me. (rap song) - Be right back. Where the hell is he going? - What? (dog barking) - What? Hey! Hey! - Hey! - Hey! - Stop! - Oh my God, Rebecca! He was supposed to wait for us! - What do we do? What do we do? - We gotta get out of here. We can't stay here. - What are you doing? - I'm getting us out of here. - No! - Rebecca, what the hell? - We don't even know what he wants yet. - Um, well, I'm pretty sure he wants us to end up on the 6 o'clock news! What the hell, Rebecca? Give it back! - He said we can't call for help, so we're not calling for help. - Oh my God! Are you serious right now? For once in your life, please break the rules. - Oh, like Daytona? "Rules are meant to be broken, Becs! "Do another line! Who cares who's filming! It's Girls Gone Wild!" And now we are being blackmailed because of it, so good job. - Right, yeah, this is my fault. - No! - Good luck. - That's not what I said. Sadie? Sadie! - What? - Don't be stupid. Come on! Look, it's one thing to be down here already. It's another thing to be walking the streets on your own. Look around. (phone chiming) It's them. Here, hold this. Hey, where are you guys? - Five And Dime. You? - [Western Ave.] - [In Englewood?] - Yeah, well, there's a cab waiting for us. If we all just stick together, everything's gonna be fine. [After this, we should be over halfway, right?] - You know that Reese really wanted us to elope? Just the two of us. [If we'd just eloped...] - McKenzie, come on! - Brandon would've come after you, anyway. - [Yeah, but he would've come] after just me, not all of us. - No, you don't know that! - Just promise me if this gets to be too much, you leave. - Kenzie, shut up! We're... We're all in this together. We're not gonna leave you. - I love you guys. - We love you too. Psi Beta forever, OK? - Psi Beta forever. - That was great, except there's no cab waiting for us. - She's already scared. She doesn't need to be scared for us, too. Hey, about what I said, it was stupid. - No. No, no. You're right. Daytona was stupid, OK? I saw his bastard friend filming and I should've known better. - I know. It's not like you put a gun to my head. - You scared? - Of course I'm scared, but I have to believe we're gonna get through this. - OK, Rebecca, look at me. I know, like, you always feel that it's your responsibility to take care of us, OK? Sometimes you gotta take care of yourself. Let's just go and get this over with, OK? - OK. (man yelling indistinctly) (blues music) - This place looks exactly the same. (phone chiming) - It says, "Back then, stranger danger didn't seem to exist. What if it had been another stranger's kiss?" - He wants us to tag-team kissing a stranger and then send him the pictures. - Gotta be kidding me. - Who you think? - It's a toss-up. - Lucky guy on the left. Let's go. - Hey! Gotta be more where that came from! - I'm afraid that was a one-hit wonder, sir. - Oh, so you're a cock-tease, huh? Ah! You crazy bitch! - You wanna see crazy? - McKenzie, no! Stop! We gotta go! - Whatever! - Oh my God! Is he following us? - No. - OK, I'll text him the photos. - I wonder how many likes that'll get. - I thought you quit. - I keep one stashed in case of emergencies. One of the first questions the lawyer asked me on the cross-examination was how often I smoked, which doesn't sound like it would have anything to do with anything. But then he asked me if I'd ever lied to Brandon about smoking. He hated it when I smoked, so I'd never tell him. Well, if I'd lied about that, then I must have lied about being raped. I asked him why anyone would do that, but he kept pressing. "How much did you have to drink that night? "How often did you drink? How much did you have sex? Where did you have sex?" And I just kept saying, "I don't remember," which just proved his point. Brandon could recall every last detail. So, when he said it was consensual, that's what they believed. Bastard's word against mine. (phone chiming) - It says: "Your ride's across the street." What's he talking about? - That's Reese's car. - What? - I have a key. (car chirping) He must've gotten Reese here somehow. (phone ringing) - [Reese has assured me you had a spare key.] - Brandon, enough! Where is he? - Don't worry about Reese. We're having a great time. You know, he told me that you two bought a house together. I'd love to see it. [I trust you've sobered up enough to drive?] - Yes. - Good. You got 15 minutes left. (electronic music) There's a crack house right there in the 8000 block. Go in, ask for Santa and buy a 20 rock. - I don't know what's worse, getting disbarred for buying crack, having an incriminating video get released or getting one of my best friends' fianc√© killed. - How about getting us both killed? - I have mace. - Great. I feel so much better about this. - Look, just follow my lead, OK? I'm looking for Santa. - Is something bad about to happen? - It depends if I can get a 20 rock. No! I need that! - Insurance. Down the hall. Watch your step, ladies. d When it's Christmas time d - Whoa, whoa! - Don't mind her. She's my little helper. Welcome to the North Pole! What can I do you for? - I'm just looking to buy a 20 rock. - You came all this way just for a 20 rock? - Yeah. This should be more than enough. - Depends. Have you been a good girl this year? - Yeah. - What's your name again? - (weakly): Rebecca. - I didn't hear you. - Rebecca. - That's my mother's name. No one shows up at the North Pole uninvited unless you want your face blown off, Rebecca. Don't do it again. - OK! OK! Are you OK? - Yeah. - Oh! OK, OK. Ugh! It's OK. (phone chiming) OK, next task. Go to-- Go to Greek Row, Kappa Tau Theta House. - I thought their house got shut down. - It did. - OK. - Five tasks done, three to go! We're over halfway there. With, uh, three hours left. Did you know that's how long it took them to acquit me? Well, I mean, two hours and 57 minutes, to be exact. It was supposed to be the happiest day of my life. "In light of the evidence presented before us, we the jury hereby find the defendant not guilty." But the damage had been done. The second that bitch pressed charges against me, I was already guilty. (tires screeching) And she's the one who gets to move on? She graduates with honours, gets a great job, falls in love with a nice guy who's gonna treat her really well. Well, I was supposed to be that guy who put the fancy-ass ring on her. That was supposed to be our life. (phone ringing) Are we home sweet home, baby? - What are we doing here? - [I just thought it'd be fun] to see how the other half lives. Let's start with the living room. Wow, spacious and neat. Nice, big kitchen. You remember the last time you cooked for me, you burnt the ramen noodles? - Things change. - That's true. Hey, wait, wait! Go--go back. [To the right.] [Yeah! It's your parents' lake house.] I loved it up there. Hey, where's that glass piece from? - Spain. - [It's beautiful.] Well, time to move to the medicine cabinet. - Why? - [You don't truly know someone till you go through their medicine cabinet.] [Come on, Kenzie. You were a walking pharmacy back in college.] Remember all those pills you used to take? - All that disappeared] [when I stopped seeing you. - Is that haemorrhoid cream? Interesting! - Are we done here? - [It looks like you and Reese] [have built a fine home together.] But now comes the fun part. - [What's that?] - You get to destroy it. Let's see how much damage you can do in 20 minutes. - Brandon, this is insane! - Hey, you always said that material things didn't matter to you. Why don't we start with that glass piece from Spain? [That's where we talked about having our honeymoon together.] Oh! Ho, ho, ho! That's the spirit! I'll leave you ladies to it. (chuckling) Hey! It's just stuff, right? (upbeat music) - d Got me too superstitious yeah d d Most love can fit inside d d Your head d d (phone buzzing) - We have visitors. (muffled screams) (muffled screams) Nice try, Reese's, but you know the beautiful part about this old house? Thick walls. They can't hear a thing. - OK, look, forget it. Let's go. - Sadie, we've come this far. He said this would be it. We just have one more stupid task and then it's done. - Be right back. Hidden behind a curtain, there was a special room. We all knew it as The Tomb. Members only, but sometimes we'd take a bribe. A place to show your devotion to the tribe. (suspenseful music) - Oh God... You would never know this is up here. - I think that's the point. (alarm system beeping) - What the hell? This isn't funny! - Ugh! There's nothing! Nothing! There's no cell service. Soundproof walls. This is where he took her that night. OK. "You laughed together, "cried together, got super high, and now it's time to brand yourself a Psi Beta Kappa Pi. You have 20 minutes to complete or someone's gonna die." - "When the iron's the colour of ash, it's the perfect temperature." These are like instructions for branding cattle! This has gotta be a joke. - No. He wants to give us a permanent scar so we'll never forget. - I don't care! We're not doing this one! - We don't have a choice! It says if we don't, someone's gonna die. - Oh my God! - Sadie, there is no way out besides the way that we came! - God, this is insane! - Look, I'll go first. - OK, whoa, whoa! So--so--so what? OK, we--we do this, and then he lets us go and we live happily ever after? - Yeah, something like that. - Rebecca, I can't do this to you! Come on! - Look, there's vodka, and you're a doctor. I'll be fine. Just take it. - Oh God! He's telling me to give you a third-degree burn! - Well, just pretend you're experimenting with a new medical treatment or something. Somewhere you can't see. The... lower back. - No, no. OK, there's-- there's too much cartilage, and it's gonna f--fry the bone. Upper arm's best. - Oh God! OK! I'm ready. - I can't! I can't! - We are running out of time. Just do it already! (suspenseful music) (screaming) - Were you ever in a fraternity? Yeah, I didn't think so. It's supposed to create this special bond. It means that your brothers got your back. You--you know what our motto was? It was, um, "Not four years, but a lifetime." I mean, why else would we put up with all of it, right? And at the beginning, they were there for me. When she first pressed charges, we all met up in that room, and they kept saying, "No, no. Screw that! "How could she do that to you? She was your girlfriend. "No, she's lying. She was too drunk to remember what happened. Screw her! She's a slut." But let me tell ya, when it hits the fan, those brothers will disappear on you real quick. There are very few people you can trust in this world. (sighing) (phone buzzing) - It's done. You happy now? - Yeah, almost. Do you remember what I bought you that Christmas the first year we were together? - Brandon... - [I mean, it was nice,] [but it's not as big as the one that you're wearing.] And my dad said to me: "Wow! That must be a special girl to buy a present like that." And then a year later, you lost it, and you said to me that you don't need a ring to prove how much you love me. - It's his grandmother's diamond. - Well, if you really love Reese here, that shouldn't matter. [So, take it off.] - Brandon, stop! - I said take it off! Now flush it down the toilet. - [I can't.] - Then get Joelle to do it. - I'm sorry. - You don't realize how much you miss something till it's gone. I'll call you back when it's time to move on. - He's going to kill him, isn't he? He's going to kill Reese! - Stop it. He's messing with you, OK? He's just trying to get in your head. - You were right. I never should've testified against him. - I was just trying to protect you. - I thought I would be able to tell my story, set the record straight. But in the end, it was just his version of the story that came through, so what the hell was the point? - All the girls said that it was the right thing to do. - For who? Remember when he was kicked off the team and someone photoshopped that picture of me screwing the team mascot? Tagline: "She screwed us bad." It got 48,337 hits before the school finally took it down. To the sorority sisters, I was just another charity case to rally behind, and to the rest of the world, I was an alcoholic slut who cost the school the championship. - And that's why you left Chicago. - I couldn't get out of here fast enough. The only reason I came back was for Reese. - He had it custom-made especially for this. He was planning this night for a long time. - He got what he wanted. - Don't you get it? It doesn't matter, OK? He's a sociopath. He's not gonna stop. - What are you doing? - We have to get out of here. - He's gonna be back any second. - Exactly, OK? When he does, we gotta run for it, OK? - Don't be stupid. This is never gonna work. - Rebecca, if we don't get out of here, we're both gonna die. - What if he has a gun? Come on, Sadie, it's not just about you. - Yes, exactly! It's about all of us. - I made her a promise. - That was before he threatened to kill us. And if we don't get out of here, how are we gonna warn them? - I'm scared! - Look, OK, shh, shh, shh... We are gonna get through this, OK? Psi Beta forever. - Yeah, Psi Beta forever. (phone chiming) - "Sorry about the ring, but it had to be done "to remind you that life is as sad as it is fun. "The last task is a place where we first made up rhymes, a place where we always lost track of time." - It's the library. - Last task. It's almost over. - Let me check on our friends upstairs. (dramatic music) (alarm system beeping) Ah! (screaming) - Run! Run! Run! - Come here! (gasping) (grunting) - How often did you guys (car chirpingcome here? - Usually after an all-nighter. He wanted to see how many sections of the library we could have sex in before getting caught. - Sounds like Brandon. - Mm-hmm. - Do you think that you were ever really in love with him? - I thought I was. We should really call Becs and Sadie. - I'm sure they're fine. - It freaks me out he had them go back there, though. (phone chiming) - "She didn't make it." What? Oh my God! - Oh my God! No more. This is over. (door opening) - What did you do to her? - You might wanna think twice before pulling a stunt like that again! (screaming) (sobbing) (glass breaking) (door slamming) (footsteps approaching) So, you did get thirsty, huh? Hey! (chuckling) You wanna do this, hmm? Let's go. Do none of you listen? When we started this, I said there were rules. If those rules were broken, there'd be consequences. I mean, a bitch comes at me with a knife, you think I'm gonna let that go? - You're a monster. - Your fianc√©e never used to think so. She always saw the best in me. But--but I guess none of that matters, right? Her friend's dead. And the game just changed. Get on your knees. - If I'm not back in 10 minutes, call the cops. - What? No, I should go with you. - I need you to wait for his text and stall him and call for help if I need it. - This is crazy! We should both go. - I'll be OK. Promise. (suspenseful music) - Been a while since they checked in. I'd be nervous too. - Shut up! - I'm sure the cops are on the way by now. - She knows that if the cops show up, you're dead, OK? She wouldn't risk that. - That was before you killed one of her best friends. All bets are off. As far as she knows, I could already be dead. - You just got it all figured out, huh? - I know you don't. It's not too late. If I were you, I'd run. - Yeah, if you were me, you would run. - Cut your losses, get a head start. One-way ticket to Mexico. - Yeah, sippin' tequila by sundown, right? - Yeah, that's right! - Yeah! And then I could spend the rest of my life watching her post photos of your stupid wedding, your honeymoon, your goddamn kids, living the life that I was supposed to live! (laughing) - Do you really believe you had any shot at that life? - Until you showed up, yeah. - So, what was your big plan, hmm? What, kidnap her? Force her down the aisle? Put a gun to her head until she said "I do"? - Just shut--shut up! Shut up! - Oh, you knew it was never gonna happen, and it wasn't because I showed up. It's because of you! You can only hide the crazy for so long. You were never going to be good enough for her. - And neither are you. (sobbing) - Help me! - Hang on! I'm here! - So am I. Drop it! Found your friend looking a little lost. - Let her go. - Gang's all back together, huh? Time to get the party started. - This is about me and you Brandon, no one else. You need to let everyone go. - I don't need to do anything. It's my game and my rules, and I'll decide when it's over. Get on the other side of the table now! Since you Psi Beta girls are so good at breaking the rules, I'm adding some fun. You remember Wheel of Poison? - We played with twenty people back then. - Well, I prefer to play with two. Spin the wheel, whatever you land on, you gotta swallow, inhale, I don't care. You record every single detail, and all of this is gone by the time I get back in 60 minutes. - 60 minutes? That's impossible. - Well, either they do it or I'm gonna kill you! Clock starts now. Let's go. Have a seat, Kenzie. - I wanna see him. Reese! He's hurt! - He's alive. Boy! An interesting choice in life partner. - He's a good man. - Just sit down, Kenzie. No one else needs to get hurt. - Well, they should be on the floor by now. I remember that game doing you in. - Brandon, stop! Please! You got what you wanted. - No, what I want is for you to tell people what really happened that night. - You should know. You were there. - Yeah, I thought I was. But then a week later, I hear this crazy rumour about how I made my girlfriend of two and a half years have sex with me. They ate it all up! Golden boy star athlete turned rapist. - You got away with it. What the hell does it matter? - Who cares if the jury believed me? The damage was done! So, the only thing that's gonna turn it around again is the truth coming from your mouth. - I can't see straight. - You're doing great. Come on. - I can't. - Hey, remember what the pledge captain always told us. "It's not about chance or choice when pledging, only strength and survival." - "Let your sisters give you the strength to survive." - You got this. - So, you're gonna tell everybody that that night was no different from any of the other hundreds of times that we got drunk and slept together! - That's not what happened. - Well, you gotta think, Kenzie. I want you to think real hard. I want you to pretend like you're back on that stand again, except this time, you're gonna tell the truth. (beep) Tell people what really happened that night. - You poured me a glass of scotch. - Tell the truth. - It should've been like every other night, but instead, my boyfriend of two and a half years raped me. You brought me into that room, you shoved me on the table... ...you put your hand over my mouth and you raped me. I loved you, and you raped me. And I will never be the same again. - I was really drunk that night. And so were you, but... No. No, we'd done that. We'd done that a hundred times before. We-- That was college. We get drunk, then we make stupid mistakes-- - You're blaming college now? - You know me! I--I wouldn't do something like that! - But it was you. - I never meant to hurt you. - I know. - I still love you. I always will. - It's over, Brandon. - I really screwed this up, huh? - You just need to put down the gun. Then it'll be all over. Reese! - I had no choice. He was never gonna stop loving you. Back in college, I kept telling myself it was just a case of bad timing. Years later, I was at a conference in Florida. And it was wrong, but I looked him up. We hit it off instantly. It was just like college all over again, except this time, you weren't there. He always made me feel like I was the only thing that mattered. We had these... wild weekends together. I'd fly back and forth. I really thought that we were in love. But then he found out that you were engaged, and that was it. He snapped. And I knew that if I didn't do something, I was gonna lose him all over again. - This whole night was your idea. - Surprise. But it was just supposed to be a girls' night out gone a little too wild. Brandon would finally get his revenge and be able to let go of you and move on, and he and I would be able to live happily ever after... ...or so the story goes. I had no idea that he was gonna go so far with the stupid tasks. And Sadie! - Joelle, this isn't you. I know you. You're a good person. - Sometimes good people are capable of doing very bad things. - Joelle, no! (gunshot) - d Love was lost d d In such a tragedy d - I kept thinking I was going to wake up, that the whole night was just a really bad dream. But the nightmare was real, and pretending it never happened wasn't going to make it go away. It wasn't until I started to tell my story that I could feel the darkness lift and I could breathe again. It's never too late to tell your story. Because maybe it will give someone else the courage to speak out. We have to keep telling these stories until there are no more stories like these to tell. Instead, we can tell the kinds of stories that end with: "And they lived happily ever after." - d For your life d
