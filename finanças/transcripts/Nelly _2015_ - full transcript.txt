One hundred steps. - Come in through this door. - She said... that should come through that door. - Go down the stairs... - And go down the stairs. Alone. But I am not alone here. Do you understand? Would you like to drink something? I want to go home. Naturally. December Two. Nelly Amade, 13 years old. He stayed for two days. Living family members: negative. Provision in the will of the late mother to appoint third parties as tutor: negative. Low noise. I can hear you. It's your sound. Your beat. But you are not alone with me. Nelly? Please put your right index finger in here. You're just hurting me. So? Despite the challenging behavior typical of age, the blood samples clearly show that Nelly Amade... it can be permanently welcomed by a new family. I want to hide. Lie in your shade. And keep my eyes closed. There are three more questions, Nelly. I will record your responses directly in the database of families interested in adopting. First question: The first date. How should be? A new family. It can only be my family. I will wait to go. I will wait for him. The answer is incorrect. There are no boys of that age in the system. However, the key... indicates the desire for permanent access to the new family circle. Second question: What's your favorite sound... in winter? In the summer? Last question: How tall are you? Before the beginning and after the end there is silence. That's what my mom said before she started measuring me. So I stretched out my arms, one on each side. One hundred and fifty hundred meters. It was my wingspan the last time she measured me. Then she touched my fingertips and said: "Everything you want: where is it?" I always gave him the same answer: "Here, in the middle". Jump across the seas To feel It's the distance from the streets That made it real Cry But don't persist in it Because the faith that has always existed Can be lost The wingspan is the same... the height. An additional function allows me to take a wish into account. Nelly? Do you have any desire? No desire. You are no longer alone. I'd rather be alone. In my bed... near my window. Take this to greet your new family. I'll wait outside. Everything will work out. - How long have you been like this? - 40, 50 minutes. Fifty steps on the right foot.
