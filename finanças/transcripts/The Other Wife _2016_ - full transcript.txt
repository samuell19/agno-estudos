THE OTHER WIFE Subrip: Pix 9-1-1. What is your emergency? There's a man in my house! He's... he's downstairs in the office. Where in the house are you, Ma'am? Everything's gonna be okay. Debra. Ma'am, what's happening? Open the door, Deb. Open the door! Ma'am? Debra. Officers are in the area and on their way now, Mrs. Jennings. Just stay on the line with me. Mrs. Jennings? Let me see the hands! Let me see the hands! Get down! Get down! Hands up! Okay, okay. On the ground. On the ground! I live here. I swear officer, I live here. The police have arrived, Ma'am. Okay. They've apprehended the suspect. I'll stay on the line with you until you reach an officer. Do you feel safe to go out? Ma'am? I think he's gone. Ma'am, are you okay? Ma'am, are you okay? I'm okay. Okay, I'm gonna stay on the line with you. Do you see the police? Yeah. Yeah, the police are outside. Okay, It's alright to go outside. Ma'am. Ma'am, stay where you are. No! That's my husband! I'm the one who called. I'm his wife. What is going on? And you're sure he didn't take anything? Not that I know of. He was looking in my husband's safe. We'll file a report and I'II, give you my card just in case. He kept calling me, Deb. Do you know anybody by that name? No. Maybe he thought he was at someone else's house. We'll have some officers patrol the area for the next couple of nights and make sure you're okay. And I'll be in touch. And we want to apologize again for the mix up, Mr. Jennings. We'll show ourselves out. You okay? Yeah, I'm just a little scared. You're afraid he's going to come back? Mhmm. Maybe. Okay. Let's stay at a hotel tonight. Really? Thank you. Alright? You're my love. You're my life. You want to go pack a bag? Thank you. What the hell was that?! I told you. Time's up. Where's the money? I wasn't lying. It was in the safe. Was. I had an opportunity. An investment. Okay, this would double your money. I promise you that. If you could just wait. Wait for this investment to make a profit. No. No. No. No. You gambled with my money. And you lost. You work for me now. Look, this project of yours. It's... Look, I don't feel comfortable. We're talking about innocent people here. We can go to prison. Not we. You. Uterine lining, thickening. Follicles increasing. That's good? It's very good. I can't help but picture a baby on that screen though. This is progress. You still have a long way to go. Thank you. Thanks. I'm sorry, Mrs. Jennings, but your card declined. Do you have another credit card I can try? Are you sure? Yeah, I ran it twice. Okay... Yeah, here. No! Mrs. Jennings, I know this must be very difficult for you but we've got to go through the evidence. The break-in last night might be completely unrelated or it might not. And, it's possible evidence. Can I... Can I have that? Thank you. Was your husband in any kind of trouble that you knew of? Did he have any enemies? No. Did you guys owe anyone money? No. I mean, we had some debt like everyone else but that's all. Did Billy have a life insurance policy? Yes, why are you asking me that? Honey, how are you? Mom. Why are you questioning me? Am I some kind of suspect? I'm just trying to get a clear picture. Well until there's a lawyer present my daughter's not saying another word. We're sorry for your loss. We'll be in touch. I just keep seeing his body hanging there. This is not your fault. It's not. It's not. Diamond credit services. What is your name and account number, please? Yeah, hello. Kate Jennings. 41840936905. I... there seems to be a problem here. There's been a mistake on my credit card. Alright Mrs. Jennings, what seems to be the problem? It says here that we're overdraft $4000, but my husband and I, we pay... we pay the credit cards off monthly. You're right Ma'am, that amount is incorrect. The current amount due is $29,286. -No... What?! No, that's impossible. There was a total of $25,000 in cash advances made since the statement was posted. Mrs. Jennings. May I have a word? Do I know you? Not directly. I'm Craig Addison. A friend of your husband's. I'm an investment broker. We were supposed to discuss a contract today. I don't know anything about it. My husband just passed. I'm so sorry to hear that. I'm wondering... Did Billy leave any kind of a message for you, Mrs. Jennings? Excuse me? Well, if you do find anything that Billy might have left for me, or if you need any assistance, give me a call. We're gonna watch her. You're a cosigner on all of these accounts, and you never once looked at them. I... No. I mean, Billy took care of all this stuff. Listen, Mrs. Jennings, I'm gonna do you a favor. I'm gonna pretend I didn't see any of this. Your husband is beyond overdrawn on all of these accounts. And it doesn't appear that he's paid any taxes in over five years. I haven't spent a lot of time auditing these, but if you ask me, I would say he was involved in some form of money laundering. What?! As a cosigner, you could go to jail for a very, very long time. No, my husband was a responsible man. He was a... highly regarded physician! I didn't see any of this. Good luck, Kate. Okay. Kate, wait. One more thing. I did notice a number of funds being funneled to the account of another woman. Debra Stanton? If I had some questions, I might look to her for a few answers. Thank you. Hi. I have a package here for Deb. Thank you. Actually, it's a $30 C.O.D. Thirty dollars? Yes ma'am. Are you gonna pay it or not? No. Alright. The company should pay that, obviously. It's not my fault they screwed up. I don't just have a bunch of cash laying around, you know? Look, no problem. It'll be at the Post Office when you do. You knocked on my door. That's my property! May I help you? No... My car... My car broke down. What do you want? I'm Kate. Do you know who I am? You're Deb, right? I know who you are. I keep hearing your name over and over. I know about Billy. And who are you? I don't want to cause a scene. I just need to talk. Welcome. So Debra, what do you do for a living? We can skip the small talk. Say what you came to say. So, you're with Billy? Yes. Apparently, so are you. Has he not told you anything about me? I figured something was going on. Can't get out and do much anymore. 'Cause the accident, my leg. Never could. He comes up missing so often. He says it's work, but how stupid does he think I am? Well, I'm sorry. For your sake. Really? Yeah. You just thought you were dating a nice doctor. He's the married one, not you. You didn't know he was married, did you? Just breathe, baby. Are you okay? Are you one of his patients? No. I'm not his patient. I'm his wife. I don't understand. That photo. Was that taken at the Santa Rosa Winery? Yeah. You know how I know that? Because he took me there too. Did you stay at a nice hotel that was like an old Mission? And maybe you went night swimming too! You need to leave. I'm calling the police. Go ahead. Ask for Detective Samuels. He'll tell you exactly who I am. Here, look. I'm calling Billy. I'm sorry. Billy's dead. He hung himself. I found his body. I followed the paper trail and it led me to you. I mean, I thought maybe he was having an affair, but married to another woman? How long have you been married? Two years. You? We met in high school, but we've been married for ten. And now you're pregnant? Is it his baby? Yes. He's my husband. Okay. I came for what I needed, so I'm just gonna let myself out. If you're telling the truth, then what about the funeral? We can talk about that later. Maybe. Hi. No! Drop the phone. Come on. We're taking a ride. Now. Where are you taking us? Shut up. Why did you break into my home, you son of a bitch?! Get in. Why are you doing this? Does the name Addison ring a bell? The investment broker. Billy owed Addison a lot of money. Addison's boy said Billy keeps it in a locker at the golf club. The golf club? Where Billy kept all his gambling money. You really didn't know a thing about that guy, did you? Anyway, Addison's money is there. Billy owes me money. You're gonna go get it for me. Who are you and why does Billy owe you anything?! Because your husband wasn't the nice, upstanding guy you thought he was, Deb. She's Kate, I'm Deb. I'm sorry. It's really hard to keep all of Billy's wives straight. Now drive. Now you just go in there, get the money from the locker, and come back out. That's all. What's to stop me from going in there and calling the police? Because, by the time they get here, all they're gonna find is that one dead, and your prints on the murder weapon. Get. Quick. Yes? my husband had a membership here, and I need to get into his locker. His name was, Bill Jennings. I'm sorry, but, unless you have a membership yourself, I can't help you. My husband just passed. Can you help me please? Did you kill my husband? No. But he's not really your husband, though, is he? Screw you. I want to talk to you. You and me. I want to make a deal. Level this whole thing out. Don't touch me. Thank you. Just, please, don't mention it. Okay. Thank you. Take your money, and then leave us alone. What the hell is this? Where's the rest? I... I don't know. You're joking, right? This is ten grand, tops. Billy owes me half a mil. I don't know. There's a lot of money in this world. You're gonna find me mine. One way or another. My God! What did you do to her? You have twelve hours to refinance your house, sell your crap, do whatever you gotta do, to get the money. Or what? Or this one, she dies. And you go down for it. I'm calling the police. I've had enough of this. I don't think so. See legally, you cosigned on Billy's business. And that makes you just as guilty. When they find out, it's jail time. I'm sure that accountant, she told you that, right? Please, just make him stop. Can you just stop hurting her, Okay? Find my money. Or this one... Bang. I'm sorry. God. Why did he hit you? I told him to leave us the hell alone. And called him a few choice words. Ed didn't like that. Ed. That's his name? How did you know that? Because he told me between punching me in the face and me calling him a pig. I don't think you should stay here tonight. I think you should go stay with some friends or family, or something like that. I kind of take care of myself. I did, until Billy came along. Maybe we should just run. You don't think he can track you? Yeah, I do. Okay. So... He wants money, we get him the money, it's simple as that. You're not gonna call the police? I mean he's not a psychic. He doesn't have ESP. How would he know? He'll know. Kate, I believe him. I met him at the clinic. I gathered. I looked at the patient files. My leg still hurt so bad because of the accident. He was doing these pain treatments on me. He really hooked me up. He was a great doctor. He helped a lot of people. I crushed on him hard. I fell for him. He proposed after four months. What?! We had a long engagement. Billy believed that, he wanted to be sure considering that he only wanted to get married once. My God. What's wrong? There's less than $20 in this account! The last time I checked, there was over $10,000! Billy cleaned it out. I don't understand. If he was so scared of Ed, why didn't he just give him the cash? Maybe he was giving it to somebody else? Maybe I have something in my checking account. Not anymore. Billy. Unbelievable. Is this your laptop or his? Yeah, It's both of ours. He used it more than me. Okay. What's all this? Here, look. Names, numbers. Looks like bets to me. Bets? No. Billy wasn't a gambler. I mean, occasionally we'd bet on the golf, but he wasn't a gambler. Yeah, maybe you didn't know him as well as you thought you did. What are we gonna do? Ed wants his money in the next 24 hours so, we're gonna sell what we can, borrow what we can, we get him his money. Hopefully we can figure out where Billy put all this cash. I'm not staying here. Ed's gonna come back. You can stay with me. At your house? You and Billy's? Well, at least we'll be safe there. The police are patrolling the neighborhood. Did Billy buy you this car? We bought it together. He said he had all these medical school loans and... we couldn't buy much. I'm an idiot. You're not an idiot. I can see why he would have liked you. Your smart and pretty. Sounds like you guys had fun together. We had some fun. I was just some fun. That's not what I meant. I mean, it felt like, you know... He was the love of my life. And I was his. Kate, there's a cop car. We can't go in there. Kate. What am I supposed to do? It'll be okay. When Ed hit me in the car today, Kate, I could see it in his eyes. And he will kill me, and he'll kill you. He's dangerous. I think we just need to remain calm. Kate! Where have you been? I've been worried sick. Whose this? This is Deb. We need to talk. Mrs. Jennings. Yes? The coroner is ruling Billy's death a suicide. Then what are you doing here? Because the more poking around I do about your husband, the more complicated things become. And I no longer believe the break-in, the night before his death, was just a break-in. I think your husband was involved in illegal activities, Mrs. Jennings, and I think he was in way over his head. I don't think it's a leap to say Bill had a lot of secrets. While I don't believe the man who broke into your house murdered Billy. I do believe that he was involved with Billy's business, somehow. Or, I mean, he could have been just some guy who got the wrong house? You suggested that yourself. Then why did he say the name "Deb?" I don't know. Deb is a common name. Are you pressing charges, or do you have some kind of court order to look at my husband's finances, Detective? No. But I was hoping that you could help. It's been a lot for us, and this is a family matter. I would kind of like to take care of it on my own. I think we all would. I want to give this back to you. Thank you. If someone is threatening you, I can help. We're okay, thank you. Okay. Detective. When can I have Billy's body back? Or do I? I have no idea how any of this works. We'll have his body ready soon. We'll let you know. Thank you. Kate? I'd like to speak to you for a moment, please? Yes, Mom. Just give me a minute, please. Yes, Mom? You want to tell me what's going on? Exactly what it looks like. Billy... married another woman two years ago. What I want to know is what she's doing here, and what that police officer was talking about. Are you in some kind of danger? No, Mom. It's fine. It's okay. Billy and I got married in Puerto Rico. Courthouse. He said he was too busy working to go on a real honeymoon, so we went to San Francisco for the weekend instead. Was that in a February? I remember that. He had a conference in San Francisco. Okay, let's... Let's get you upstairs. And some rest. You got something for me? Yeah... There was this cop over here. Cop?! Thank you. So, what's the plan? I just spent the last few hours looking through Billy's office, and I found nothing. Did you look at his phone? I mean, should I say "phones?" Yeah, I looked. Phones, emails, nothing. I'm mean, If he's hidden the money that he got out of the accounts, then there's no sign of it anywhere. What was the last thing he said to you? Maybe something you didn't think much of at the time. No. He just said "I love you" before he left for the office, and then he left me a suicide note. What did it say? That's all? "Find happiness in new beginnings?" It's like a damn fortune cookie. Well, my mom's gonna lend us some money, even though she has no idea what it's all for. And I suppose I'll go to the bank today and see about refinancing. Did he have a life insurance policy? Yes. But it's all tied up in red tape. There's... There's no chance that we can get it to Ed today. Ed is going to kill me! He's going to kill my baby! Even if we outrun Ed, even if he never finds us, we still stole money from this "Appleton" guy, or whatever his name is, and he's gonna come after us too. Addison. Wait. What are you looking for? Someone who might be interested in what our friend Ed is doing with his money. He's supposed to be an investment broker. Seems legit. Excuse me. I'm looking for Mr. Addison. I was supposed to talk to him today. Mrs. Jennings. How nice to see you again. I was hoping that you could help me. Take them to the back. No! Call the police! These men are trying to hurt us! Please, no! Come in here! I appreciate you coming to see me. I'd prefer our conversation here to be private, though. You understand. I want to thank you about your concern for the package your husband was watching for me. You seem like a good person. That's why I'm going to give you some advice. Our associate, Mr. Warwick here, filled me in on the details of the insurance plan. He and your husband planned to offer up the clinic. I think it would be a good idea to go forward with that plan with you as a cosigner in your husband's stead. What do you get out of it? Did you ever wonder... why Billy killed himself? I can only guess, but... it probably had something to do with the fact that he knew that me and him are not men that take "no" for an answer. We didn't say anything, okay? It seems to me that you don't have the funds our friend wants. That you should take Warwick up, here, on his gracious offer. And if you did even one transaction, right away, as a show of good faith, he might be able to wait. Give you some time to earn the payments. What does it involve? I'd be happy to go over all the details. It's a much more elegant solution for you, Kay. I would strongly advise you to take it. So you want me to take advantage of people who are in need, or in pain? There's something I want to show you. Look. This is what happens to people I have no use for. Goodbye Mrs. Jennings. Ms. Stanton. Let's go. It's okay. It's okay. You're okay. God, I never should have gone to her. She's just an innocent person. This is my fault. It's not your fault. They're monsters. The Addison guy's a monster too. Listen, all we have to do is do what they ask of us, then they'll be out of our lives. I can't steal from them... I just can't. Kate... But I can't do it! You'd be involved anyway. What?! Right? If Billy hadn't... passed away. You'd be involved because you're part owner of the clinic. You'd be part of it and you'd never even know. No! But now I'm doing it knowingly! I can't! We don't have enough money! Kate! If we don't hustle and figure this out really quickly, the people they're hurting are gonna be us. Okay, It's time to run. What? Hey, Hey, Hey! What happened? What happened? Are you okay? I'm fine. We have to get you to a hospital. Stop. Stop. Deb, We've got to get you to a hospital. Squirmy little guy, isn't he? Takes after his dad. We'll do a full checkup, but I have to say he looks great. Totally healthy. His heart rate's a little high. So is your blood pressure. So, my advice is gonna be for you to get some rest. Okay? Thank you. See you in a bit. That's amazing. You were trying too, weren't you? You can't run. That's no kind of a beginning. I'm not gonna let them hurt you. Either of you. You look good. Thanks. Here goes. What's she doing in there? Trying to get a second mortgage. Let me tell you something. If I didn't need you cozying up to Kate, you'd be dead right now. She's the important one. You're just the other wife. Make it happen. Jesus Christ. How'd it go? Nope. He already refinanced the house twice, so, my loan was denied. How much dough I get for this? Ten thousand, at least. What about yours? It's be more money to tow it away. Okay. How? Pawn shop down the street. I'm sorry. Come on. Let's go sell my car. Thank you. How much? Not enough. I still think Billy withdrew all the money and hid it somewhere. But where? I don't know. Let's go ask him. I'm sorry. I did a little background check on your friend Deb. Did you know she did some time? Check forgery. What are you trying to tell me? It's just interesting. She likes money? I notice your... Your mother's here to pick you up. Did you sell your car? I was wondering... How much it would cost to have Bill's body transported, and... What if I didn't have the funds? You said, cremation, I remember. I'll have it taken care of. Why would you do that for me? Because I, I feel like you could use a break. If you're in trouble, just write "yes." Everything okay? Yes. Thank you, detective. Mom, give us a minute please, we'll see you in the car. Deb, is it true that you've done time? Yeah. It was a long time ago. So why didn't you tell me that? Are you mad? I've made a decision. I've seen enough dead bodies to last me a lifetime, and I don't want yours to be the next one. So I'm gonna tell Ed and Addison I'm in. Okay. You okay? Yeah. My knee, my back, it's the same old story. I'm falling apart. Why don't you go upstairs and get some rest. I'll bring you up a snack, Okay? Yeah. Here, give me your hand. Thank you. What? I wouldn't do anything more for Deb than you have to. There's something wrong with her. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. She's out of options, I think. Yes. She's ready. I was afraid I was out of luck. The other woman... Suzanne? Yeah, Yeah, she called, she said you know, about the doctor. My wife said that he healed her neck pain. Said he had miraculous hands. Well our new doctor, he trained with Mr. Jennings. So, they're in the same class. When we brought him on, I thought of you. You said cash only? Yes, up front. And then we have your account details for after that. How come it's so much up front? We have... processing fees. It talks about it here in the paperwork. Whatever you say. I just need... I need a miracle. Mr. Moore? I hear you're in a lot of pain. -Yeah. -Let me help you. Easy. That was good. It's a good start. Who is that man, and what is he gonna do with Mr. Moore? Treat him. Of course. He's some doctor Addison found. Just another Hippocratic Oath fanboy. Just like Billy. Don't be so jumpy, Kate. Guy's gonna get what he needs. Get used to it. This is the new regime. You got a lot more coming in today. It's not polite to put your feet up on other people's furniture. Sorry. You don't like me. Don't take it personally, but ever since my daughter met you, she's been falling apart. That's not my fault. I said, don't take it personally. You know, a baby is a wonderful gift. Yeah. Maybe the only good thing Billy ever gave me. Children need strong role models. Not like me? That's up to you. Can you just answer something for me, please? I just... Why did you sell your ring? And why did my daughter sell her car? Why did she borrow money from me? Be honest, please. Don't tell Kate I'm telling you. Okay. We're trying to pay off some of Billy's debts. It's okay now. I think we've got it worked out. Then why are you still here? I don't know. Deb? It's me. Mom, what's wrong? Your friend Deb, you can't trust her. We've talked about this. I'm serious. I found something in the guest room. Where is she? What are you doing? You guys are happy, right? You're okay, so... You're just leaving? Why would I stay? Where is it? What are you talking about? The money! The money that you kept from your ring! I gave you everything, Kate. It's 2000 dollars. Listen, I have a baby on the way. I take care of myself now. In the meantime, I'm becoming a scam artist for us. You pretend like you're doing this for me. Your butt is on the line too. We're doing this together. I thought that we... What, were friends?! We mean nothing to each other. Take it, and get out. Now! Get out! You know, you have hated me since the day you met me, because I'm not Billy's "real wife." I'm some naive slut that he kept on the side, right? That's not how I feel. You didn't have to say it, little miss perfect. Perfect house. Perfect life. Every time you see me, you hate me more, because I remind you of how not-so-perfect your husband is. No. That's not it. Yeah, the worst thing about it, is that you're jealous of me. Jealous? Of what? Of that fact that you have no friends? No family? No job? No future? You're jealous because you wanted a baby with Billy, and you couldn't have it, and now you want mine! How dare you! You do not hit a pregnant woman! I'm so sorry! Get away from her! No! Get away! Get away! Call the police. I'm gonna call Detective Samuels and I'm gonna tell him everything. About the fraud, about the blackmail. I don't care. Ed and Addison will go to prison. I'll keep you out, but just get out of my life! The detective's on his way. God. No. God, no! Please! Please! Ouch! Okay, I'll go. Did you hear that? Deb! Deb! Try this one. Sh... They want me to bring the money to the bar. Or they're gonna kill her and frame me for it. They could kill you too. Wait for Detective Samuels. Let the police handle this. She lied to you, Kate. What else did she lie about? You could be free of all this, Katie. You deserve a new beginning too. That's it. That's where he put the money, Mom. I need your keys. Let the police handle it, sweetheart. Here, give this to Samuels. That's where we'll be. It'll be okay. I love you. God. Be careful. Yes, I need Detective Samuels again. Now. Find happiness in your bags. At this point, you think you're walking out of here alive? Do you? You think you're going to live through this? Please, no, come on! I did everything you told me to! I told you when she called the cops! I got her in on the scam. Please! If you think you're still getting a cut, you are out of your mind. Shut up! Enough! Here. Take your money. Don't bother. I know you're working with him. We don't mean anything to each other anyway, remember? Warwick! Where was it? It was at Deb's place the whole time. I didn't know! I didn't know! Unfortunately, I don't trust you. The cops are on their way. Take care of them. No, please! Please don't shoot! Come on! Come on! Okay, we've gotta hide now. Did you call the police? They're never gonna get here in time. I gave my mom the address, I told her to send them here. I know you're here. Have you ever used a gun before? No. Drop the gun! Come on! Drop it! Now, push it away. Kick it away. Come on. Get down on your knees. Get down, now! Okay, go! Go! Go! What are you gonna do? You said the cops are coming. I'm gonna hold him until they get here. What? Kate, you're my only friend. And that's the truth. So if something goes wrong, I just wanna make sure you're Okay... Please! Please! No! Police! Drop your weapon. Right now! Drop it! Drop it! Drop your weapon! Drop it right now. Deb... Deb! Deb! Deb. Deb. Deb. She's breathing. She's still breathing. She's still breathing. We need paramedics right now! Paramedics! Hang in there. Hang in there. Hang in there, Deb, please. Okay hold on! It's gonna be Okay. I'm right here. You're gonna do great. Hold on! That's it. Honey, now I need you to push, okay? -I can't! -Yes, you can. Just we practiced, remember? -Are you kidding me? -After three... One. Two. Don't let go! Please! I'm not gonna let go. I'm right here. Ready? Something's wrong! What do you mean, something's wrong? What's wrong? The baby's breach, we need to turn him around right now. Okay. It's okay, you're doing a great job. How they doing? Hey! Yeah, great now. They're just resting. Deb's body took it hard, though. This is for Deb. You don't wanna give it to her yourself? Nah, I don't want to disturb her. I was glad to hear about your deal. I was hoping for that. I made myself a little annoying to the D.A. Well, thank you. It was the list I could do, to give the money back to those people. It was like an amends, really. Deb was happy that she could do that too. You're a good person. But, if you don't mind me asking, She tried to extort you. Why are you still friends with her? Nobody will ever really understand what I went through except her. So, that's a bond. Besides, she's a new mom. So she deserves a break. Alright. Well, give me a hug. Alright. Thank you. Detective. For everything. Alright. This is from Detective Samuels. What a sweetheart. You know, he likes you. You should go for it, but I don't blame you if you stay single for a while, 'cause you have awful taste in guys. -Yeah? -Yeah. Hi baby. You know what's funny? I've never been able to figure out why one man would marry two women who were so completely different. You know, we might be more alike than you think. You okay? I'm a mess. What's new? He's so little. He's so beautiful. You know, I was thinking... Yeah? Won't you be his godmother? You're the best person I know. That would be such an honor. Thank you. You're practically family. We all are.
