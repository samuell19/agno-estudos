Creating new men? What crap! If one man has ever left this place reformed, they can lock me up It doesn't make sense! Why give murderers and thieves clothes, food, and a place to stay? Why do we stay up guarding 'em? Officer LEE, is something the matter today, sir? It's a waste of time. Look! It's blocked off everywhere No damn fool would be dumb enough to try escaping! JAIL BREAEERS Hello? Coming through! Seven years ago I had nothing to my name Good job But I was a model citizen leading a good, honest life Coming through But then My leg! My leg! The day my body, my one possession, broke down The world turned against me and became a living hell I was so hungry I could no longer tell right from wrong What the? You punk What the hell do you think you're doing? Let go, you bastard! Thief! Catch that thief! Catch the thief! Get him! So I was caught with the bread in my mouth Stop it, you punk Let go! And Because I didn't have proper ID I was unjustly sentenced and thrown into prison It was so unfair, I couldn't bear it Freeze! I hated the thought of staying even a day! So I tried to escape Eneel! Let go! With each attempt, I failed But I never gave up Trying and trying again to escape What? You punk! - You don't give up, do you? - Wait! Because of that My one-year, two-month sentence became two years Then three years Eventually, I had an 8 year sentence But when I was filled with despair, hopelessness, rage and hatred suddenly a silver lining of hope flashed into my life! And it was And it was And it was the Lord Jesus Christ! The moment I accepted Him the anger, hatred, despair and hopelessness all vanished like so many lies When I met my Savior and shed tears of repentance the world became so beautiful Six years have passed No, 5 years and 10 months It was the most peaceful and blessed time for me For the remainder of my days, I'll do my best to lead an exemplary and honest life here Brothers, I ask every one of you to fill yourself with God's blessings, mercy and glory I ask this with all my heart And this, I earnestly pray Amen Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me I once was lost but now am found Was blind but now I see - How's it going? - Not sure Here, look Thirty-seven, thirty-eight.

It's not out yet! - Sir! - Sir! What if I don't make the list again? Don't worry, you've still got a chance There's the Inauguration, Thanksgiving, New Years, Easter - You said that on Buddha's Day - You little punk! You little punk! Is there a rule that says you have to be let out this time? Little bastard! Get out! What are you staring at? Get out! Beat it! Shit, these damn bastards! Smarten up, all of you! As I said on my first day here this is not a recreation center! These are animals who gave up the right to be human!
