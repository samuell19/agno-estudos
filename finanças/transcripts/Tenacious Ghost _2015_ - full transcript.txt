Europe and Asia are falling asleep, America's dawn is yet to come, only the loveliest eyes are reading my words now. LOL. If you realize that you're in a dark room, with blood and damp everywhere, don't worry! You're in a safe place - my heart. How much do you earn a month? Four million, two hundred and fifty thousand, without VAT. Go away, dude! Only talk to me with over $5000. Oh shit! You know, love and death are actually similar. They both come accidentally and irresistibly. Like two people in this story, who may not have found each other easily. Tho, a repairman, left his teens twenty years ago. His face is neither handsome nor ugly, but it's a strange one. And Lam, a girl who has almost everything: beauty, power and a career. Tho isn't highly educated and he's very poor. Fill my tank! 12,000 VND, please! All right, 15,000 VND! Thanks to all of these strengths, Tho has three love stories in his life. Don't bring me so far! It's almost a meter deep. You're such a coward. I just reminded you. Now carry me to 120 centimeters! Don't leave me alone! It depends. Don't, please! I like this habit of yours the most. Two of his love stories are imaginary. The third one is real. That's the girl he just texted last night. Hello, it's Tho! You read my text? Never do that crazy thing again, or I'll call the police! Lam always permits herself to do what others aren't allowed. Done. The gas flowed badly. Thank you, uncle! Call me bro! I was your age 20 years ago. - Save my phone number! - Yes! Whatever you need to have repaired, just call me! - Yes! - Broken motorbikes, broken computers, broken roofs, or even broken toilets, call me, ok? If you go on a broken airplane, - call me too. - What for bro? I may get you incense! - Yes! - Old ideas! Careless! - Boring! - Damn, swearing sounds like rapping. A pretty girl shouldn't litter! She's thirsty after yelling. I will present to the client by myself. Half of you guys will get sacked. I always bring luck to the girls beside me. - Yes! - If that's a lie, may I be hit by a car. I said girls beside, not in front of me. Watch the street, not girls! Dying for girls is ok. If that's a lie, may I be killed by a car. Move on! Is it Vinh? I got his birthday invitation. Can I join? I like the homes of successful people. Let me ask him first! We've got problems. Lam, I heard from the HR that you want to sack five people. You are not allowed to do that. They're my staff. It's not your business, Quang. Why are you interfering? Lots of people complained. That I'm in your way? You're lucky this is my favorite juice. Does he know who my family is? He's competing with me? ONE WEEK LATER No need for that, Hercules. Someone sent it to you. Thank you! Your number is being monitored by another number. Be careful! TENACIOUS GHOST Thief! I'm not a thief. I'm not. Thief! Help me! Who are you calling? Who are you dialing? I need your help. Don't be scared! I'm harmless. Gosh! She's so sexy. Psycho! There are thirty security guards here. They're tall and muscular. They're coming! They'll come in 30 seconds. Wait! Where is the 2.1 meter Hercules? The 2.1 meter Hercules has changed his shift. Can a 1.2 meter Little Boy replace? What's wrong, Ms. Lam? - There's a thief. - Thief? Running away? Hiding? You think I don't know you're here? How dare you! I'm gonna beat you up. Done? Done. A couple. Many cockroaches. Or has he climbed over the balcony? I don't think so. There are hundreds of cameras here to monitor windows and lobbies. If there is a thief, it's because you let him in. - I'm not crazy. - Or it's a ghost. It is.... You have such a sexy photo! An art photo! I didn't say sexiness isn't art. Go home. I think I'll have a wet dream tonight. I'm not a thief. If that's a lie, may I be killed by a car. What's your name? La... La... - La? - Nope, Lam. Lam. I'm Tho. Bui Quang Tho, - 34 years old. - 24. Thanks for the compliment! No, I mean myself. I'm embarrassed. All right, calm down! Actually I met you before. I remember somewhere in Heaven. I just saw a huge land of gravel. Then Red-headed Su and The Goddess carrying the basket were collecting pieces of gravel every day. Don't your remember the day that we met? It was on Saturday the 27th at 17 o'clock on 7th Street. I thought it was good luck, but it was bad luck. Now I understand that each piece of gravel carries a person's life. Every time the Red-headed Su collects one piece of gravel, one person on Earth goes to a distant land. Got it? Are you kidding me? Look at me! I don't have anything for you to be scared of. Isn't that right? I'm just a spirit. I can appear anywhere without any restrictions, even in the daylight. How can you be here when you're already dead? I begged The Goddess and she was moved. Goddess? If Saint Su knows that I helped you, he will punish me. Goddess, please help me to live! How can you? You can only go back if you're a ghost. That's fine, let me be a ghost! Do you know this game? Guess words by looking at the photos. Yes, very well. If you can guess this time, I'll help you go back. Which one? Guess it! Saint Su is coming. Hurry up! This man is a eunuch, Cong. I'm sure he is. He is holding flamboyant flowers, Phuong. Cong Phuong, player. Correct! Nonsense! You think.â€¦ Are you ok? Believe me! Here, it was the powerful piece of gravel that she gave me. It carries the power of my spirit. So I can communicate with you. Take a look! Here, look at it! Take a look! - Trust me! - Liar! You just threw a glass at me? Nothing can touch me. And I also can't touch anything. Don't believe me? Touch me! Come here! See? Go through me! Believe me? I'm a ghost. Please help me with one thing, because only you can see and hear me. Why not anybody else? Because you're the last one I saw. Are you crazy? Who asked you to see me? Anyway I saw you and died. If you hadn't passed by, I wouldn't have seen you and died. OK, you're a ghost. You can't touch anything, even me. So what can you do to me? But I have the power of the dead. Help me! Don't be scared! Ms. Lam, don't be scared! You have to help me. How weird! Girls are scared of me whether I'm alive or dead. What's happening to me? I must be drunk or hallucinating. I was about to take a shower, then I remembered that I don't need it. Naked ghost! Are you scared of ghosts or my sexiness? Wow! Don't bring this anxious face to the party, ok? I took care of everything. Here's some garlic, a crucifix, and a Buddha statue. If that ghost is still after you, throw these things into his eyes. His eyes will fall out. He won't follow you. Hi! What do you think of the party? Crowded, nice, fantastic! I'll leave her in your care, OK? There are only couples here. Do you have any brothers? Ah, yes I do. Wait a few seconds! Ah no, that's not necessary. I'm not ready. Vinh! Yes, I'm here. It's Vinh, my younger brother. Can you be her dance partner today? It's my honor. Have a good time! Boy, be mindful because I often step on my partner's feet. Don't call me boy while dancing! So big bro, ok? You don't look so good today. Is anything wrong? No, I'm fine. You're the one who looks tired. I watched C1 soccer last night. That's more important than girls? Yes, more than everything, except you. Throw the glass away! What's wrong, Lam? Now Ngoc Lam will sing a song for Vinh, the host of this party. Please welcome Ms. Ngoc Lam! Lam, they're calling you. Come to the stage! I'm not ready. Don't worry! They'll like it. Let's go! Lam! Lam! Lam! I'm gonna sing for the host and everyone here the song "Come to me". What's wrong? I'm sorry! - You must want to slap me. - How rude! She even slapped him. My sister has a hobby of slapping those she loves. What's that, Lam? Don't touch it! Shut up! Sorry, Mai! You can handle it. Don't read any horror books at night anymore! He follows me to toilet, bedroom, and ceiling. He can appear anywhere he wants. He has too much free time. Hello baby! It's him! - Who? Where? - Behind us. Behind? No one, nothing. Oh, my mandarins! NEUROLOGY DEPARTMENT How is my sister, doctor? She's fine. Don't worry! - I gave her a prescription, plus extra. - Yes. If you have free time, you can take that. I thought you were the one I had to check, not your sister. Yes, I planned to have a checkup after her. I will share part of the prescription with you. Just take it periodically! Yes, I do. I take it every day. - Oh, do you? - God, you know, having this job is a bad influence on me. Let me tell you this! At times, when I'm at home, I have a lot of nightmares. - Gosh! - Like someone was strangling me. When I woke up, I saw myself wearing a mask. I could barely breathe and was stifled. Then I took the mask off. I pulled the mask out, then put surgical gloves on. Don't blame me for getting angry! Amitabha! Is it 9999 Gold? It's approximately a tael. You're done for sure. I go to church every Sunday. Amen! You're done. Wow! Garlic is a useful spice in life. It helps strengthen your immunity. You'd better eat them raw. Fried garlic smells better. You should come to my house, Lam. Why should I? True! I don't have to hide. I need your help. You are the only one who can. If you decline, I have a gift for you. Is it cute? I hate this! What can we do, doctor? Examine her again! It's so cool! I only get to ride in a convertible after death. Crazy! What do I have to do now? I have a huge amount of around 30 million VND. Help me give it to them to use. I've told you that you only have one hour with me. Then please go away! One hour? That's not enough. - Tenacious ghost! - Tenacious? What are we here for? You said I just needed to show them where you hid the money. You think my Dad would believe that girls like you befriend me? Use your brain! Wearing used clothes should be ok. But the smell is not that good. It's hard to prank him. You choose. There are lots of fashionable models. Hey! Don't think that I will believe everything you say. Forget it! I think you need to know a little about my family's style. Bo, my one-year-old youngest brother, is passionate about crying. Only I know how to calm him. Xo, my sister, has a passion for football just like me. She loves playing boys' games. She's nine years old, but studying grade one. My father is a worker, but unfortunately he got injured. He has some artistic passion, so whenever he's free, he composes a few songs and sells them. Can I park here? Not everyone is bad, you know. Most people in my neighborhood are very kind. I'll pay if your car is stolen. You can't. Cars kill liars. You're already dead. Too cute! Lam! I also have this funny thing. Do you have a phone? We should take a selfie and post it on Facebook. For ghosts to hit like? Well... Are you drunk? You'd better help me with it. Are you Tarzan? Why do you live here? Yes, that's why I like you, a rare species. Stop grumbling! We've arrived. Don't know to greet older people? Greet my father! Hello! Hi, who are you looking for? Say you're Tho's love. - You crazy? - No! I'm handicapped, not crazy. Say that you're my girlfriend. - No! - If you do, my dad will be happier. No! - I'm Tho's girlfriend. - What? - Get up! Get up! - I'm sorry! How can you let my Dad fall on you? Let me help you! How could you do that? My sister shot him. Who is she, Dad? Tho's girlfriend. How naughty! I see. MECHANIC BOOK Everyone has his own puberty. It's so damn hot. How long will it take to go around? It breaks down before it can. I had puberty late, so the time was lengthened. What cake is it? This is not for kids. You're also very naughty. I kept it for safety, but didn't have a chance to use it. Never mind! If you were alive, you'd be a virgin forever. Where's the switch for the light? Near the deity statue. Where? Whatever sticks out, turn it on. Turn it on! "Seven Sexually Pleasant Nights". I didn't read that book. It belongs to my father. Ms. Lam! I got it. Exactly 30 million VND. Leave it there! Have a seat, please! Are you a trash collector? Yes! Why don't you wear a hat? The sun burnt all your hair. You're collecting trash with those orange lips. Sometimes, when the other guys see your lips like that, they might sell fridges or TVs to you. You said you were Tho's girlfriend, which means you're his chick? Nod! Yes! - Carry him inside! - Yes! - Put him in the crib! - Yes! Be careful! Tho is very kind. He has nothing but that kindness. His ugliness even hurts people's eyes. No girl can date him more than a few weeks. You know, he gets his hair cut to impress the girls. He got it cut four or five times a day, many times a month. Finally, he appeared with a haircut that knocked me down. I know for sure that you're not his chick. - Say you're Princess! - Nuts? No! I'm handicapped, not nuts. No. I had a chat with a girl on Zalo. Her nickname was Princess. My father knew that. He'll believe you. - Say it! - I'm Princess. - You're Princess? - Yes! As per your requirement, I've double-checked this project by Lam's team. It still has many mistakes. What matters is it doesn't meet the clients' needs. But lucky for us the clients are nice, so we still have a chance. We will need to improve. Where are you? Why aren't you here? Everybody is supporting Quang a lot. You've gotta come now. My name is Mai, not Monkey, so don't make me wait! Ok, I'll be there in 15 minutes. You wanna leave? I have a crucial meeting. Please pretend to be speaking on the phone! You're my girlfriend. I'm dead. My Dad is sad. Please console him! You can't leave now. But... Ok, you know that I'm a powerful ghost. Do you believe that I can get naked in front of you? Stop it! I hate stewed pork with eggs. So I'm gonna be totally naked every time you eat. You dare? Stop! Let's go! Why is he staring at me? Because you are Miss Trash Collector, and my father is a widower. That girl is, too. She's a girl but very manly. Just five more minutes! Ms. Lam, Tho has been away for too long. When will he return? Who cares! He's working far away, so he will not come home often. You have to hide the truth about my death. He won't return soon due to business in Hanoi. Business in repairing machines? Why doesn't he check in on Facebook? Facebook! Go out and play! What are you doing? Be happy! Help my father! Quick! - Quick! - Let me carry him! - Can you? - Yes! Soothe him! Compliment him! He's so cute. Yes he is. Ask him about his songs! Quick! I heard Tho say that you have composed many songs. See? He likes it. Tho told you, right? Yes. I'm a bit embarrassed. Say that you want to hear him sing! Please! Just one song. So can you sing one song for me? It's a song that I wrote for my love. It's very meaningful to me. Love is like a ship and a river The river is still flowing and the Boat is floating on the white sand hill Then one day The ferry comes to soak the sand The river is still flowing The sandhill is collapsing The boat is stuck How is it? Very stinky. How rude you are! I smell something bad. Which smell? Gosh, he's pooping. God! It means that he likes you. No worries! Wanna hear one more song? One more. I'll sing. Sit down here and listen! I've sung about my love Why didn't he hold a live show? How could he sing eight songs in a row? Who the hell dared to buy his songs? Me. I gave them money, then told them to buy his songs. My father will pay me back anyway. But it makes my Dad happy. Don't be mad! It's enough for today. Still tomorrow? Your sister shot a ball at my face. Your brother pooped on me. The worst thing is the songs. I'll never come here again. Clear? You're not comfortable when you make other people happy? Don't you find it rude to bother people? What a person! You made me be your Princess. I make in a day what you make in three months. You're nothing to me! Nothing! You think everyone wants you to be their girlfriend? I don't care about your income, your high social class, or your great beauty. I just want to make my Dad happy. Find other people! A trash collector or a noodle seller. If I were alive, I wouldn't need you. If I could, I'd strangle you to death. I want to kill you now. How arrogrant! It's your car, for sure. I guaranteed that you wouldn't lose your car, not your car hood. Nor the mirrors! SORRY I'M BROKE NOW How educated to say sorry! If you come near me, a shaman will punish you. Princess! Congratulations for the new hood and mirrors! Kiss me baby! Princess! I love you! I'm really sorry about the meeting yesterday, Uncle! I'll tell you when we have chance. Come in! I believe you can, Quang! Yes. It still depends a lot on you. You haven't met your parents in a long time. What did Quang say? You should remember that you're my niece. Nobody dares to go against you. This company's success is due to the efforts of every team. I don't need those useless teams. But those useless ones have just saved your project. Are you underestimating me? I took care of you. You have to try harder! I know why you said so. He's too much! You're slim, but your ears aren't. - Don't be mad! - Why don't you wear it on this side? Try! Hello, hello! This is good. Can you hear clearly? Why are you mad? Why not if I'm here? Oh I forgot. I heard that his presentation is great! Don't worry! I've lobbied all of them. They'll clap whenever he pauses. Even when he doesn't speak, they'll clap. Now I'm going over there. See you later! Great! Do I owe you? My Dad's heart is failing. He needs to be taken to the hospital. I'm done with it. Don't ask for more! Will you ignore a handicapped man, a nine-year-old girl, and a one-year-old boy? - It's none of my business. - Hey! Forget it, dude! I'm begging you. The meeting today is the key to my promotion to the director level. It's very important. Got it? I'm begging you. - But you... - Please! More important than my father's life? Thank you for your attention! It's the end of my presentation. I have never suffered this much in my life. I'll present now. Damn! Why should you support the idea of helping a young woman like me becoming a director? God! a new way of scratching. I really admire myself. I'm arrogant. I'm arrogant. I don't like any of you. I don't like any of you. What the hell? What the hell? Call me your mommy! I'll raise you guys. Call me your mommy! I'll raise you guys. Ms. Lam! I don't even care if you die. I don't even care if you die. What the hell? What's going on? Asshole! Straight to the point! Such a shame! Oh my god! What are you doing? You're crazy. Did I feed you those lines? Helen said you were such a shame! Please! Please come to help my father! Do you know a shaman? No, I don't. I know a Master who hit his head against a wall. The wall was not broken, but he was dead. I've never spent time with any long-legged girls at a five-star hotel. This is a high-quality hospital. Not only two, but at least four nurses will take care of you. Hospital? How the heck are these nurses so beautiful? Ms. Lam, He's calling you. I wanna tell you this. Say yes! Just tell me! If I can't recover, please help me sell my songs to take care of the two kids. There's a wooden box under my bed. It's all my life. Who knows if when I die my songs will be popular. Yes, the taste in music may change a lot by then. You're not that kind, huh? Go! Let me do the procedure! This kid seems to be crying endlessly. That's why it's a kid, not an adult. Soothe him! Know how? No. Do you know how to make spit bubbles? No. I'll show you. Disgusting! See, make spit bubbles and blow into his face. He will stop crying. Do it! He will certainly stop crying. Do it! Blow! Not like that, blow the bubbles. Blow! She's beautiful but dirty. I can't agree more. I asked you to blow bubbles, not the saliva onto him. Patient name? Banh Van To. - Your name? - Kieu Thi Xo. Why are their surnames different? Hey, Tho! - Xo! - Yes. Hold him for me! Where are you going? Come here! Lam! Why is Xo's surname Kieu, not Banh? Xo has her father's surname, but my Dad has my granddad's. So hers has to be Banh, too. So stupid! Her father's surname is Kieu. But your Dad's is Banh. Because my Grandfather's surname is Banh. It means Xo's father and uncle To are not the same person. So stupid! If they're the same, they must have the same surname. Does your brain work? So it means Xo's father is not uncle To. Is your head for decoration? My father is that old. His wife died years ago. How could his kid be that age? Actually, I adopted Xo. Full moon three years ago, I was on the way home and saw Xo lying on the street. I pitied her and brought her home. Bo's just over one. Who are his parents? Your abandoned child? How nuts! I'm a virgin. I also adopted Bo. The full moon day last year, when he was a few months old, someone put him out on the street so I brought him home. Only you are uncle To's kid? You can say so. Hey! I remember that your name is Bui Quang Tho. My father is Banh Van To. I think this one is funny. Daddy To is actually my adoptive father. When my parents died, I lived alone by myself. He took care of me sometimes. Then full moon that year, he got injured during work. I saw him alone, so I asked him to move in with me. Day by day we came to consider each other as family. You're very nice, huh? So your hobby is to collect kids and bring them home on full moon day. Oh, I'm weird. So you messed my life up because of this non-sibling chaos. They're humans, not chaos. You messed my life up due to your non-relatives. Such a cheater! Lam! Bo has slept, thanks to the nurse. Now you can pay the fee. This is the last time, absolutely the last time. Who are you talking to? A ghost. Ghost? A ghost that has a not handsome, not ugly, very weird face. Lam! Where are you going? Who's gonna take care of Daddy To? I don't care. - Lam! - Tell that ghost! Which ghost? Luckily, Quang joined to save our project. But I hate how arrogant Lam is. Hey, don't you know who her parents are? Just a word by her can blow our whole team away. Right. She's tough on people. Never mind her! Where's Quang? He just went out. See, he even held a party. He craved that position. Calm down, Lam. Don't judge a book by its cover! A friend in need is a friend indeed. Congrats! Today is your last working day. Lam! Lam! Actually, Quang will just work here till the end of this month. The staff is holding a farewell party for him today. What do you mean? His wife is seriously ill, so he has to go abroad with her for her treatment. He decided a long time ago, but boss Hoang wanted to keep him to solve some problems. Quang asked me to give you this. He doesn't want to take anything of yours. Dear Lam! I asked Mai to send you some unfinished projects of mine. If you're still interested, cooperate with our team. Wish you and the company much success! I don't need those useless teams. But those useless ones have saved your project. Don't know her parents? Just a word by her can blow our whole team away. Hello, is it Lam? Mom! I don't wanna live under the shadow of our family anymore. I want to live my own life. What's wrong? Goal! Goal, please! Even Tho plays better. Daddy, won't Lam come here again? You should go to sleep now. Lam is not Tho's girlfriend. Ms. Lam, someone has sent you this invitation. INVITATION We would like to invite Lam to the fan meeting of It's Time band at 6p.m on October 20th. - Rape! Rape! - Rape! Rape! Sorry! I haven't seen anything. Sorry, I'm thinking of you and falling into your bathroom. You tried to appear in my bath. You tried to bathe when I'm here. Get out of here! Ok, I know. - 82. - 87! More silicon. You saw anything? In the bathroom? A little bit. - How much is a little bit? - You need to get some parts fixed. Stop it! Your friends? They were my band in college. Now they became more popular. Why did you stop? Wanna go out with me? - I'm gonna get mad if I stay here. - Where's your boyfriend? - Where do you want to go? - Anywhere but a hotel. Huh? Girls like you are wicked. You'll leave men after you're done playing with us. No to a one-night stand. Do you have a mirror at home? Your face needs to be totally rebuilt. Go! How is Uncle To? Very good. So will you go out with me? Are you sad? You can't be sad when there is music. It's a ghost! I'm scared. Let's go home, Lam! Let's see a romantic movie! Sit down quickly! People will scold you. Aren't you scared? It's the worst horror movie I've ever seen. It's strange. When I was alive, I wasn't scared of ghosts. Now that I'm dead, I'm so scared. If you star in a horror movie, you'll be the most handsome ghost. I have nothing but beauty. Don't you think people get mad at your words? This ghost is funny. It's so charming, too. Lam! I thought you would never come back. Why? Because none of Tho's exes have ever come back here. They just like rich men. When I grow up, I'll love a man like Tho. You are very lucky. I taught her to say that. If girls come, just say that. Lam! You love Tho, don't you? If you don't love him, I will... - How do you do that? - I'll show you. Raise your arm this high. Don't let the oxygen come out. Clamp your armpit tightly and it will make a sound. You try! Ok! Wow! You did it on your first try. You know this? It's great. Show me please! Use your two fingers. Bend them. Put in your mouth. Use the tongue. Blow strongly. I learnt this in one month. Lam! Tho is dead, isn't he? I've just seen Daddy To burn the incense in front of Tho's portrait. He even cried. But don't let him know that I saw. If he knows, he'll be sadder. How do they live when you're no longer there? Why is it flashing red? I don't have much time left. Would you mind... Actually, I still need you to help me with one more thing. You have messed up my life. You can still feel shy? Tell me! I want to find my real Princess. Princess didn't come. In the end, those hot girls never notice us, poor men. Because life is not fair, so our hair can't ever be straight. Life is unfair, so we can't straighten our hair. How do know those words? That's my favorite status on Facebook. Got four likes and 6200 comments. Only criticism. Hands off. Uncle To? Why... Why are you here? Why are you here? How could you sign into my son's account? Because I'm Tho's girlfriend. Why did you know where he hid money? I'm Princess. If you are, why did you ask Princess to come here? You're a liar! I'm Princess. I created and used that name to chat with Tho. So he would believe that there was a girl who really loved him. My son had no chance to be your boyrfriend. Tho has died. So what do you want? I have met him. I mean his spirit. Only I can see and hear him. Only I can talk to him. I know it's hard for you to believe. I believe you. I have the same feeling. Is he around here? Yes. Right beside you. - Tho! Tho! - Yes. Where are you? I'm here, Dad. Where are your hands? Tho! Why can't I touch your hands? Here, Dad! Do you know that I miss you so much? I miss your motorbike sound every evening you drove to our garden. Lam, tell him that he needs to have his legs cured. He said that you needed to have your legs cured. My legs are useless now. I will use that money for Bo. Lam, help me button his jacket! It's cold now. Tho! Let's go home! He's gone away. Tho! Tho! Why is your life as short as a firefly's? Are you all right? Are you ok? My gosh! You're all right? You don't know to look after a kid, so don't have any! Sorry! I'll pay attention next time. Don't mind her! Let's go! I hate whoever lets kids wander. Hello, is it Lam? Now? It's 18+. I'm meeting my client. A very important one. Liar! All right. I can touch everything now. Are you OK, Tho? I'm good. I came to apologize for what I did to you. But if it wasn't you, I don't know who I could trust. You can't quit that dirty habit, huh? Many people told me to quit too, but I didn't want to. Actually, this habit is a memory of my birth dad and me. When I was a kid, if I was sad or disappointed, my dad told me to do that. Then I felt better. It's true. You should give a try. See. I'm sad, so I pull it out. Then flip up! Watch it dropping down. If you do it 2000 times a day, all your sorrow will go away. You're such an interesting ghost. You can know many things, even others' secrets, and can appear anywhere you want to, on the roof, or in the wine glass. You even can make your head bigger. But there's a thing that I can't do. What is it? Touching someone. I also want to touch a ghost. I can touch you. Nope, I feel nothing. Yes I can. Really? It's strange. Try again. See, I can touch you. Why didn't I feel anything? I can't touch you. Try one more time! It should be longer this time. I'm sorry! Is it Vinh? I'm listening. Have you slept yet? I haven't. I'm at your door. Really? Wait a bit! I'm coming down. Yep. Is that Vinh? Yes, you should leave now. I'm coming down with him. Lam! My parents have put me in a a position that isn't mine. What did you want to do? To be a singer. A singer? It's nice. But they didn't like that job, where temptations can easily spoil a person. That's up to us. Don't ever give up on your dream! Damn this shitty handsome guy! Sorry! I'll wait till our wedding. You're full already. How could you eat more? But I don't want to wait. He's able to do that? It's my cat. Is it a black-out? It never happens here. It's nice then. Do you have aromatic candles? Yes, in the kitchen. Wait for me! What's happened? What's wrong? Oh nothing. Things are messed up because I fell. Are you ok? I'm fine. Let's continue! You have many cats? Go home. We'll talk later. But... What's going on? I'll call you. You're really adorable today. - Let's go! - But... Let's go! What are you doing? - How could you? - You love him? Every girl loves him. - He's a bad guy. - Now you've gone too far. You shouldn't mess up, and you have no right to. I saw him take another girl to a hotel. He gave you sweet words as his hand touched that girl. Stop it! If he's bad, he wouldn't reject me last time. If he's an actor, he just plays villain characters. Hello? A sea trip? Tomorrow? Yes, sounds good. All right, see you tomorrow! I'm really sorry for what happened. Ok, sweet dreams! Bye! You see, Vinh knows that I'm sad. Without love, he can't know what I like. 98% of women like sea travel, while the rest just don't admit it. Even if you envy him, don't make it up! Vinh is a great man. Yes, in your eyes, Vinh is a good guy while Tho is just a bad one. We're done now. You may forget that you were dead. I'm sorry! I didn't mean it. I'm going to bed. Help me clean things up. Lam! I know a man like me has nothing for you to notice. And if I weren't dead, I would never have a chance to be with you. But it's weird that this is the happiest time of my life. What does a woman like you need in a man? A sincere heart. I'll take Mai with me. What do you want? You don't love Lam. We can talk. Calm down! Please! Are you running away from me? I'm not. I swear. Or I will help you give up on football betting. No, please don't! Just listen, no need to see. No, I have my own company. What the heck is your company, huh? My girlfriend... My girlfriend will pay the debt for me. She's rich. I have my way. I swear. Lam! You don't see me anymore? You can't hear me anymore? Don't you hear me? Lam! Don't go with him! Don't go, Lam! It's very dangerous. Lam, stay here! Is it just a dream? Why I am here? What's that? When will Vietnam join the World Cup? Why did you ask that tough question? Vietnam will join the World Cup sooner or later, but the world may play another sport then. Why are you so negative in thinking? This voice sounds familiar. It's Goddess. It's a small happiness that I brought to you. Your visa on earth is about to expire. You have to go back. Oh no. I will not. I have to stay here. Stubborn? Though you love her so much, you can't do anything. You're just a weak ghost. You can't touch anything and people can't see you, either. Stubborn? How can you go into such a place? Goddess, please help me! Each person has his power, and so do ghosts. When you tried to touch and save the kid, You used the power of the gravel. Your spirit gravel is out of power now. Let nature take its course! So I don't need any gravel. I will give it back to you. What is it? Goddess, what's wrong? That piece of gravel is your spirit. Since he swallowed your spirit, you can live in his body. It means I'm inside his body now. I can control his body, too. Wonderful! - Stop kidding! Let's go back! - No way. I have to help Lam. You should help me, too. Saint Su will punish me. I'm begging you. Please! Please! Solve this riddle! Saint Su asked me many times, but I still can't figure it out. What the hell is "He - comma"? Hey, Tho! What is "He - comma"? Help me first! How great love is! Mai. Vinh. Can I talk with you for a while? You love only Lam? There's no more room for Mai? Lam is my girlfriend. Are you seasick? No, I'm sick of being away from you. You two are friends. That's what you like. You like playing that game. You're that kind, right? Mai. Mai. Mai. What are you two doing? He doesn't deserve you. He's taking advantage of you. I, Tho, know it well. Tho? I know what kind of person he is. I won't let you harm Lam. Are you two lesbians? This shitty man. He uses drugs, gambles on football, and loses billions of dong. He takes advantage of you to pay the debt. No. Is that true? That's not everything. There's more. Here. You see? What is it? Huh? You dare to interfere? Take it slow. Let go of her! Lam, it's Tho! Tho here. Be quick to tell others! Tho! How dare you! You met me on purpose from the beginning. Otherwise, I'll be killed. Twenty billion is nothing to your parents. I need your hot clip. So they'll send me money. Don't! Be a good girl! I promise I will not let you down. Such a bastard! Help me, Tho! I can't. You have to defend yourself. Who is Tho? Are you on drugs? What are you mumbling? Tho! Asshole! Let her go! Help me! Asshole! Let her go! Help me!! Tho!! My head is hurt. Help me, Tho! Let me go!!! Let go of her! Run! Cry for help! Help me! Please! Help me! You have to help me. Otherwise, I'll kill you. Help me! Lam! You want to drown here? That's what you're choosing. Tho! Help me! Bastard! Jump down to save her! You have save her. Wait for me down there! Tho! Help me! Hang on, Lam! Lam! I'll watch you going to hell. Start! Action! You must save her! Help me! Go to hell! You're done today! Lam! Wake up, Lam! It's Tho! Lam. Come on, Lam! This asshole! Lam! Lam! Wake up, Lam! Why did you bang my head? I was doing CPR. Wake up, Lam! She's not dead. Do CPR! Lam! Who's gonna save us in the open sea? Gosh, crying doesn't help. Be quick, Mai! Wake up, Lam! She's not dead. Lam! She's not dead. I'm begging you. Please drop that gravel down! - Are you insane? - It's Lam! She can't die. Keep your hands off Saint Su! I'm begging you. Please let Lam live! Why don't you take that bastard's soul instead? I told you it was nature's mission, which can never be changed. I don't care. You have to drop it down. If you take this gravel with you, you will never reincarnate. So punish me! You're alive, Lam. You're alive. It's Mai. Try to stand up. I'll take you home. You have to let Lam live. You have to let Lam live. You have to let Lam live. You're alive. I LOVE YOU IF I'M A LIAR, LET A CAR KILL ME IF I'M A LIAR, LET A CAR KILL ME RESIGNATION LETTER Please give this opportunity to those who really love this job. Mai is devoted and talented. She deserves to have an appropriate position. Do your parents know this? I have talked to them already. Now it's time for me to live with my choice. Send my apology to all the colleagues who were troubled by me, please! Xo! The audience is this excited thanks to my songs at the end of the show. They'll all surely go home. Tenacious Ghost! Where are you? I miss you. I miss you so much, with your weirdly ugly face, your weird hairstyle, and your dirty nose-picking habit. Will I ever see you again? I'm afraid of ghosts. But I hope you'll appear! Come and scare me one more time! Is it you, Tenacious Ghost? You know, love and death are actually similar. They both come accidentally and irresistibly. Please help Tho! You don't have a heart? Please help Tho reincarnate! Hey, Goddess! Yes! Do you know why I always ignore your requests? I don't know. You lisp when begging. Solve this riddle! HE COMMA I'm stuck with this riddle. I'm tired of doing this. What the hell is "He comma"? What the hell is "He comma"? You're mad? Yes. I'm getting ten times as mad as you, because no one can give me the answer. See. Anh ay refers to males, right? - Yes. - In English, males are "him". Yes. Phay is a comma, a punctuation mark. In the North, people say Phay, but in the South, we call it Phet. All right? Yes. We have "Him Phet". Using spoonerism, we get... Het Phim. â€ŽTHE END
