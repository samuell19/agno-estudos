You're early, take a seat. Little formal, don't you think? I got a date after this. So please, with all due respect, what the fuck do you know? See, that's the problem with you government type. You can't enjoy your job. Now, I'm no fed. Ain't trying to walk in your shoes but if I was, I assure you I'd be living it up, you guys got to have short lifespans. Come on man, you know I'm right. Oh, take it easy, Uncle Sam, I'm just fucking with you. If you want this to go through, I encourage you to tell me exactly what you know. Guy you're looking for is up north now. Where? Washington, little town near the border. What town? Place called Morgan. Probably move there for all the fucking beautiful mountains. These sons of bitches are everywhere. How long has he been up there? Two, baby. Wow, I sure do love me these college girls. - You know- - Listen to me, you hillbilly scumbag son of a bitch. I'm calling my superiors in DC in one minute, and if you don't give me exactly what I asked for, you can kiss this sweet deal of yours goodbye. I'll leave this shit kicking Podunk town and you will never see me again. But before I do that, I'll drop a line into your old boss. I'll tell him you and I are drinking buddies now. Hell, I'll even tell him what bar we like to frequent. I'll make sure you spend the rest of your miserable life looking over your shoulder. Am I making myself clear? This guy man, this guy is a fucking nightmare for everyone now. He was his best killer. Fucker could track anyone down. You'd never even know he was in the same room with you till he popped you in the back of the head. Then one day, boom, he started offing everyone. Shot up the boss real bad, left town. Now, I got close sources that say since he's left the boss has sent at least three or four guys after him. Guys? Contract killers? And none of them come back. Here's your coffee, sir. Thank you, ma'am. How do you know he's still in Washington? My inside man. He said yesterday, boss heard from someone. They're now following him. Worst information boss has had in weeks. So naturally my inside source said he's pretty excited. So, how about my deal? Son of a bitch. Sir? Don't talk to him. Yes, ma'am. My name is Catherine. My son found you on our property. It looks like you were shot. I tried to clean it up as best as I could. Are you a doctor? You'll probably wish I was when the meds wear off. Preacher, actually. I know, most men have the same reaction when I tell them. I guess it's odd, especially for a Catholic. I noticed your rosary, it's on your hat there, along with your Bible. What happened? I gotta go. No, you need a doctor. I'll be okay. I live in a cabin not too far from here. Here? Fellow's Cabin? Elijah, go back to your room. I didn't know if Fellow was renting that out. I'll have to ask him about that. So we're neighbors. Mind telling me how you got shot? Did you call the sheriff? I thought about it, but you would have bled out by the time they got here. Did you find anybody else? Was someone with you? I think I'm being fair here. I take you in my house and I clean your wound. I tell you my name and you say nothing. Nick. Well, Nick, I think it's only right you tell me how you came to be shot. My son plays in these woods and we've had hunters trespassing. It wasn't a hunter. If you can walk, I'll take you into town. There's a doctor- They're a day early. Stay there, I'll be right back. So how's things sweetheart? You boys are pretty early. Thought the crew started tomorrow. Prettiest preacher I ever seen. Where's your boy? He's getting ready for dinner. Dinner? I'm starving. There's a diner about 20 minutes from here. You should ask for the Fish and Chips. You seem scared, something wrong? No, I'm fine. You got company? No, of course not. Yeah, just couldn't sleep, right? Yeah, I just like sleeping by the fire, that's all. Someone got hurt? My son cut his knee on some rocks. Rocks? Get your foot off my table! Listen, I could stand up here all day and talk to you good people. God knows I love the spotlight. But I think I'll just get right on it. Today with the help of the Fitzgerald Community Fund, we celebrate the groundbreaking of this fine outlet. This will be a beautiful establishment to help the city and keep us moving in the right direction which is up. Thank you. I can assure you we'll be done in two days. Now, can you assure me you'll have what we negotiated? Fitzgerald of Fitzgerald Investment Real Estate and the President of Fitzgerald Community Fund. Exhausting. Wow, the ceremony was that bad? These people are blind. They live in their own world. Yeah, well, that's good for business, girl. They're best kept in the dark. Speaking of business, heard the preacher has been acting funny. Well, we should go visit her I wasn't sure if this was the right cabin. I thought I'd check up on you. Oh, it's better. And I also wanted to apologize for last night. I'm just protective of my son, obviously. And we've had a crazy week. We have some work being done in our land. I understand. You probably need to rest, so we'll be off. If you should ever need to go into town, I don't mind taking you, until you're healed up. That'll work. So Nick, where are you from? Lots of places. Moved around a lot? My father was a Colonel and I've seen tons of army bases in my life. When I got married and I got pregnant, I was so happy to plant some roots. I didn't want them growing up like me, vagabond. Widowed or divorced? So how long have you lived here? A few weeks. Weeks in that cabin? That place is pretty- - Shitty? Elijah, keep that kind of language out of your mouth. Yes ma'am. Pardon me, but he's right. It's shitty. But I like it, it's quiet and it's- - Hidden? I sympathize, sometimes I wish Elijah and I could just disappear. Stay hidden from everyone. St. Francis has mass today, and that's why you're going? They have those beautiful bells that ring every day. I've always liked the Catholic tradition of daily mass, actually. One must be very devout to go every day or have a lot to atone for. Thanks for the ride. See you kid. Heavenly father, please give us strength. We know you have a plan for all of your children, and we know you comfort those who are waiting. After you. Thank you. Good morning, young man. You ever heard of knocking? Yes, thank you. Is your mother in? Mr. Fitzgerald? Morning. We need to talk, Catherine. Well, Mrs. Nelson's husband just passed, so I really need to be here right now. Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry for your loss Mrs. Nelson. Thing is though... We have an appointment. You do? Yeah. Okay, give me a second, will you? Of course. Didn't you used to have a secretary or something around here? Had to let her go. Half of my congregation left after I took over. But you know that, don't you? Well, I hope there's no hard feelings about that one. I mean, I have no problem with a female pastor. I mean, it's 2021, for Christ's sake. Some of my partners, some people in the community, are a bit more conservative than me. Got it. I thought maybe you came here to tell me that I'd see you at the Sunday service. No, no, no. As much as I do love to hear the word of the Lord, I'm a very busy man, very busy. But I always have my Bible with me. So you don't have to worry about me. We have come here today to talk about a little project, and how it's moving along. This is a good thing. It's a great thing for the community. For you. That little man out there. You may benefit, but I'm not so sure about my son or me. You know how much I trusted your husband's judgment? His friendship? I took his counsel. He's a godly man, a good man, and you should trust him. I did trust him, but that doesn't mean I trust you. I don't know what it is you're going to do when that tunnel is dug. I don't care to know. I just want you to do it, do it and leave us alone. That's exactly what we intended to do, Catherine. So just turn a little blind eye for a while and we'll be gone, okay? We're just moving cargo. Nothing to worry about. Look, my son and I have done everything you asked. We've kept our head down and we've let those low lives into our home for you. We won't get in your way. I'm so happy to hear that, Catherine. Happy, happy, happy. 'Cause I would have hated to remind you of the debt your husband owes to Emilia. And what you and your family owe her. You'll never have to remind me of that. Good. Have yourself a good day. I appreciate the ride and everything. Maybe we'll bring you dinner tomorrow night. I'd like that. Great. See you later, Nick. Damn fine tunnel we made here. As a bonus. You think they'd throw in some those guns they're smuggling? Why? What, you hunting with AR-15s now? Keep your mouth shut about that, all right? You don't ever talk about the cargo. This Fitzgerald guy's paying us a shit load of money. So we don't wanna go fuck it up, okay? Hey kid, where's your mom? When a man asks you a question it's better you answer. Hey, pretty preacher. She's upstairs changing. Wish I could join her. What game are you playing? You see when I was your age, it was just me and my mom too. And I remember one day coming home crying. Bigger kids roughed me up, again. She went inside, she came storming back out with a switchblade. And she said, "If one of those bigger kids ever come at you again, you cut those mother fuckers. And I promise you, they'll never pick on you again." You see kid, look at me, look at me. You can choose to be fearful or you can choose to be fearless. Now you tell me what that game is gonna do for you right now. What's it gonna to do? What's going on here? Saved by mommy. Where were you earlier today? I was at my church. Well boss lady doesn't want you in town while we're working, you stay here. Well if I don't go to my people, they come to me. And that's not allowed right now, correct? You just keep everyone off your land until we're done, okay? Elijah, come help me with the firewood. Please leave my house. Prettiest preacher I ever seen. I'll be in the tunnel. You better lay off that shit, you look fucking messy. Fuck you. Up we go. What's wrong, boy? Do I scare you? I do? Little old me? Shit I ain't scary. I know scary, men. I'm pretty nice once you get to know me. Always on that video game thing. Book. Book, game, whatever. How much these things worth? Let me see the damn thing. Now! Stop! You better tell your little boy here to be careful. You don't touch him, ever, you hear me? Well, aren't you all high and mighty. You're drunk. Hell yeah, I'm drunk. I'm celebrating, woman. And I'm getting paid pretty handsomely. Completing the tunnel and all, and well, I thought you could join me. I know since your old man is dead, you in need of some good old fashioned adult company. You got something sweet for me? You go play in the woods, boy. I'm warning you to shut up. The fuck you gonna do about it preacher? No! Elijah run. Go! Where you going, preacher? Fucking bitch! You gonna be a good whore for me? Where you going jackrabbit? Sir, help! I've always wondered what it's like to be with a woman of God. I bet it's divine. You can't do this. I can do whatever the hell I want. Hey. Are you all right? Everything's good, it's going according to plan. Hey, hey! Stop! Drop it! Drop it. Now. Get your ass up, Pryce. Someone wanna tell me what happened here? He assaulted us. Assaulted? He hit you? Oh, you mean he tried to... You stupid mother fucker, Pryce. You wouldn't want this going to Mr. Fitzgerald. You know I wouldn't. If he so much as looks at me again I'll tell him. Where'd you come from white knight, huh? You the preaches boyfriend? He's our neighbor. Oh, yeah? Well, ain't that fucking neighborly? Coming over here to help. Good on you. Pryce, get in the damn truck. You'll be seeing me again, big boy. I promise you that. Who are they? What did they want? Nick, Nick, don't. Please, don't. What are they moving? I don't know. I don't wanna know. I gotta go. Elijah, come on. Nick! Please, don't go. I'm scared. Kid, if I stay, you and your mom will be in more danger than you already are. At least for tonight. Just to make sure Pryce doesn't come back. I made him angry. Please. Redd. Where the hell are you? I'm afraid I can't tell you that. You know what kind of you're getting into? Well, I wouldn't be good at my job if I didn't. When I grab this asset, we'll be able to bring that whole damn house down. Man, you're fucking crazy, Redd. Yeah, I take that as a compliment. Did I find you? Oh, I think I did. I think you're being a bit presumptuous. People around here don't have vision. Nobody wants change. I say okay to a condominium development and my office gets hundreds of complaints because you know why? People want green surrounding them in spring and summer. And they want white snowy mountains in winter, not concrete. That being said, I agree with you and your party. I say, develop the town, but do it right. Yeah, Maxine, I've been called a lot of things in my life. Presumptuous has never been one of them. You see we've been securing all this real estate for the miles, just for this reason. And me being the sole financier, should have you jump out your knickers to get involved with this. Think, no outside investments, no foreigners. Home grown talent, building up this city. Then that is a beautiful thing. That Mayor is the American dream. Emilia, care to join? I'm sorry, I forgot your name. It's Mateo. Mateo, cab. Make sure it has legs. Nothing sexier than a woman who runs a tight ship. Glad to see that your business is doing good. Yeah, since my boy passed, rest his soul, Emelia here has been running this business like a little empire. Hey, the usual, make it a double. Oh, Jesus. Well, got to cut it short Mayor, but as always, it's been an honor. Now, you make sure you push them permits through right quick, okay? It's good for town and I'll make sure it's good for you. You take it easy, Mayor. The check when your ready. Bud. So, how many times have I told you can't fucking come here? Sorry, this was an emergency. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. I'm assuming the tunnel is finished. Yeah, yeah, we're finishing up. What's the emergency? It's the preacher woman, she had someone fuck up Pryce. Really? I came out of the shed and Pryce was getting his ass beat by this guy. Almost took his face off, fuck him up good. I don't... What? Who is this guy? Tall. Had white hair. But he knew what he was doing. I guess Pryce was breaking balls with the kid and preacher lady didn't like it. So she came down, she punches him and this fucking guy comes out of nowhere with a shovel and fucked him up. Oh, preacher ain't no saint. Okay, well, you shouldn't fuck with her kid. When we have a mother scorned. That's gonna be rough. We should go talk to this guy. Have a chat. No, no, no, no, no. This first deal has to get through, no matter what, on time. We'll revisit this, go see this white hair feller, and we'll all get along. Great, mother fucking kumbaya. You see that, Bud? Can't have it. I can't have Emelia going off the rails. It never ends well for anyone. So you tell Pryce to keep those creepy little redneck hands off that mother and son. What about this guy? I mean, if Pryce sees him, he's not gonna stand down. He's gonna go after him. Pryce ain't go do nothing. When this is done, you can take care of him. You can take them all out. But that tunnel... that tunnel gets finished. Is that your son? He was. How did he die? Emilia put a knife through his throat. I didn't know. What? I didn't know. Of course you fucking did. Thank you for staying until he went to sleep. I'm sorry we kept you. You're gonna judge me for this, but so be it. I thought so. I used to hate the thought of it. Drinking to drown your sorrows always seemed so weak. No need to confess to me. That's another thing I've always liked about you, Catholics, confession. Hard thing to do, spilling your guts to a stranger. I can tell you have something eating at you. Something eats at me as well. Sinning. My husband spent his whole life avoiding it, preaching. He put his faith above it, and I was so proud to be his wife. But he soon fell into sin. All because of his wrath. Our daughter was taken from us by a young man, car wreck. He'd been drinking. Elizabeth just needed a ride home, but she was the only one to die. He lived, served his time, but Don couldn't get past it. He was consumed by it, our church floundered. And then he made a horrible decision. He found out what Emelia and Fitzgerald really did for a living. Kept it from me, but he knew the kind of people they were. He went to them for vengeance. They took that man and killed him. Don sold his soul to the devil. I have to let them use my land now. That's my confession. That's what eats at me. I killed people. Most deserved it. Some I'm not so sure. Would you do it again? If I had good reason. Well, look at us, two lost souls. You and your son need to get out of here. That's not an option. I have my church. For God's sake, my husband and daughter are buried here. Do you think these people are just gonna up and leave? There are two options here. You're gonna get arrested with them when the cops find the tunnel or they're going to kill you and your son. So if you won't leave, you're gonna have to deal with it. Deal with it? It seems like the only option. I am not going to kill anyone. I didn't say you. I am not going to have anyone kill on my behalf, ever. They need me and my son for whatever it is they're doing, and they'll be gone and I can move on with my life. They were my sister's. She used to collect them. What are you reading? "Gulliver's Travels." You're back. Yeah. You're heading into town this morning to meet your business partners, right? I'm going to my church and then I'm going to see if Fitzgerald can just forget the whole ordeal. I'm coming with you. And then what? I don't know. Tell him you hired me. Hired you for what? Odd jobs. Just let them know that I'm gonna be around for awhile. So this is not going as swimmingly as we had hoped, has it now, Catherine? Well, I came to tell you that we won't be a bother to you anymore. Not that we have been. To be fair, it's your men who aren't very- - Very what? Uneducated? Uncouth? Zero tact? I know this, it's why I hired them. To get the job done. Much like your friend. Nick, is it? Tell me something, Nick. What brings a fella such as yourself here to our little town? Shh, hey. Guys, excuse my daughter-in-law. She can be very passionate. I was just passing through, but now I think I'll stay awhile. He's just renting a cabin on the property next to us. Catherine hired me to fix the place up a bit. Did she now? I'm mighty good with my hands. Well, I bet you fucking are son. And no doubt you now know about our little enterprise. You've got one month until we shut the tunnel down. Now wait! After that, you'll get off her land. Okie dokie. Elizabeth. Thank you. One for the road. No? Fuck off. Catherine, see you after. He's gonna be trouble. Not for much longer. I'm... You're what? I'm fucking angry! How dare you speak for me! Catherine, calm down, I- - Get your own ride back. And you know what? Don't step foot on my property again. - Catherine- - No. Catherine. Yeah, I got eyes on him right now. You want us to do it now? Not in town. Understood. A little longer, buddy. I'm gonna smash his nose with a shovel. I brought it. That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard. White hair, gray fedora, bingo. Boon! Don't move, keep looking forward. The fuck? Who's that? It looks like is you after all, hiding in plain sight. Clever but not original. You probably think I'm one of those guys hired to come out here and kill you. Shit! I'm gonna have you take a little trip with me. Where to? One way ticket to DC. Oh, and I forgot to introduce myself, Agent Redd. Pleasure. I'm actually surprised how easy it was to find you. Once we got the drop on your location, all it took was some inbred informant to give you up. Okay, we've got to grab them both and take them out of town. Don't you fuck this up, Pryce. I know what to god damn do. Yeah. So why won't you go on and slide on these cuffs? Try not to make a scene and make this easy for yourself... The fuck are you? Shut up. Come one shot. I'm the big, bad wolf baby. Now both of you, get in the fucking truck. I'm afraid that's a negative. Why don't you go on and get out of here, pal... I got a rental any way. Don't make me ask twice. I will light you up mother fucker. Hey, it's Bud. I know who it is, is it done? No, there's a problem. We didn't get him, we ran into trouble. There's someone else trying to take him out. I don't know, maybe he got him, I don't know. We're on our way to the preacher's now then we'll head to his shit hole cabin and we'll do a clean sweep. Okay, no more fuck ups now. Oh, and one more thing, kill the preacher and the kid. It'll be okay. No, I told you, I don't want you here. They're gonna kill you and your son. You've got to trust me on this. Shit! Shit. I know that you're trying to help and I appreciate it. Shit. God damn fed is here, shit. I got to call the boss lady, you keep your damn cool, Pryce. Shut the fuck up, dad. That's it, here we go. Whoa! Hey, preacher bitch. Why don't you come on out here? Does that thing work? I don't know. I got something for you. You and your fucking kid. I'm gonna go talk to them. Shut the fuck up, Pryce! I'm gonna put them both in the fucking ground. Shit, mother fucker! That was pretty savage, cowboy. The way you killed Pryce, you did me a favor. I was going to kill that idiot anyway. You out of bullets aren't you? Where are you? Fuck you. Oh, shit! We're 30 minutes out. Is it done? Bud? It's done. Go! That's it, it's all over. You have more shells for this? Catherine, do you have any more shells? I know where they are. We have to get out of here. I have to save Elijah. We don't have time for that, they're already on their way. We have a better chance to hold our ground. Oh, Jesus. Boon. You gotta love phones these days, you can track 'em. Just in case some one tries to take and steal your car. We don't have time for this. Don't you even think about it. Now, you and me are gonna take a little walk back to my car. I'm not going anywhere. You sure about that? Any second now there's gonna be people coming up that hill ready to kill all of us. We're wasting time. I don't care. All I want is for you to get on a plane. Now move. And leave them here to die? Leave who to die? Elijah. Son, you don't wanna get yourself involved with this. You know what happens when you pull a gun on a federal agent? I do. Over by the fireplace. Welcome to the shit show. Give me that. What are we gonna do? Kill them all? Yeah. Five in total. Six. Lady, I don't know how you and your son are involved with this man, but you should know he's bad for your health. He's one of the most ruthless criminals in the country. Are we on schedule? Yes, of course. And Catherine? We're going with plan B. Emelia, that complicates things. If you gonna do this they have to disappear. They will. Listen, no pain, just dead. Mom? I'm so sorry, baby. I'm so sorry for all of this. Where are you going? I can stop them from harming us. Fitzgerald knew my husband, they were friends. They're not gonna kill me. Should be me the one going out there. I'm the fed, they'll listen to me. Shut up. I can't let you go out there. Mom? Mom? You really need all these men here, Emelia? Just being thorough. Enough of this. I've been bullied and scared for too long. I'm not gonna hurt you or your son, preacher. But that man inside there has to die. And then it would just be business as usual. This all can stop now. I've tried to live with what my husband has done for too long. I've tried to do right by my son. What are you trying to say? Help her. We have to do something. Do what you will, Emilia, but know that I won't be your prisoner any longer. I'll tell them what he did. The deal he made, what you did. May the Lord have mercy on my soul and yours. Did you think I had a conscience? That I don't just sleep easily at night knowing what I did? Because I do, and trust me when I say, after I kill you and your son, I plan on going home tonight and laying my head on my pillow, sleeping peacefully. That's more like it, preacher. No! Elijah, Elijah, Elijah! If you go out there, they'll kill you. Trust me, okay? Take this, go in your room and hide. You're okay? Go. I would've killed you sooner, if it weren't for my pathetic father-in-law. If it were up to me, I would have murdered all of you just taken over your land. Did you think someone was gonna come rescue you? Elijah. If we get out of here, you're coming with me, deal? This is F.B.I. Special Agent Lloyd Redd. I'm in the Breaker's pass territory under heavy fire. Need back up now! I'm out. Here. I got to get to her. On three we move. I guess you're not so much of an asshole after all. This is it? Let's have some fun. All right. Enough. Catherine. Hey, you're gonna be okay. Elijah! Elijah! Give me your jacket. Come on, give it to me. Hold it there. You're gonna be okay. She'll be fine. Come on, take your mom. Take her, hold her. Fuck off.
