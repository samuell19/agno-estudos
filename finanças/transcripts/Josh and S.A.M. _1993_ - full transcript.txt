YOUR FATHER WILL MISS YOU BOTH IF YOU DON'T VISIT HIM BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS. I'M NOT LEAVING YOU ALONE WITH A DRUG SMUGGLER. JEAN-PIERRE IS A VERY HONEST AND RESPECTABLE BANKER. YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE IT. THAT'S WHY YOU NEED ME HERE. DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT A $200 CHARGE TO HIS GOLD CARD FROM THE URBAN OUTLAW CATALOGUE? HOW WOULD I KNOW ABOUT THAT? I'M NOT ACCUSING, SWEETHEART. HE HAD TO CANCEL HIS ACCOUNT. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT KNOW. [DOORBELL RINGS] THE URBAN OUTLAW CATALOGUE. THE BABYSITTER. THANK GOD. IT'S OBVIOUS. IT'S HOW HE LAUNDERS HIS DRUG MONEY. MRS. WHITNEY, I'M AFRAID SAM STARTED ANOTHER FIGHT IN SCHOOL. HONEY... WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT? SEE, MOM? THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DRINK WHILE YOU'RE PREGNANT. SAM'S AN INTELLIGENT BOY. HE'S TESTED VERY HIGH BUT HASN'T PAID ATTENTION IN HIS SUMMER CLASSES. [TELEPHONE RINGS] I'M AFRAID THE SCHOOL HAS TO HAVE HIM REPEAT THE SECOND GRADE. HELLO? ANOTHER WHOLE YEAR IN SECOND GRADE? SO? WHY CAN'T YOU COME? I'M LEAVING IN 15 MINUTES. NO WONDER YOU GET ALONG WITH DAD'S STEPSONS. THEY'RE BRAIN-DEAD, TOO. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. GOODBYE. SAM WILL BE FINE WHEN HE GETS TO FLORIDA. HIS FATHER KNOWS HOW TO TALK TO HIM. THEN SEND HIM THERE ALONE. BOTH OF YOU, GO PACK YOUR SUITCASES. WE'RE NOT LEAVING TILL TOMORROW AFTERNOON. NOW. I DON'T WANT YOU MISSING YOUR PLANE AGAIN. YOU WOULDN'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND A BABYSITTER ON SHORT NOTICE? NO, I WOULDN'T. OH. YOU KNOW, SAM, I DIDN'T WANT TO MENTION THIS WITH MOM AROUND, BUT I KNOW WHERE THERE'S THIS SECRET PLACE THAT ALL THE KIDS WHO FAIL A GRADE GET TOGETHER. IT'S WAY OUT ON THE BLUFFS, HIGH ABOVE THE PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY. WHAT DO THEY DO THERE? JUMP OFF. MOM, WHY ARE WE IN SUCH A HURRY? OUR PLANE DOESN'T LEAVE FOR ANOTHER 2 1/2 HOURS. JEAN-PIERRE HAS LUNCH RESERVATIONS. ME AND SAM HAVE TO HANG OUT AT THE AIRPORT 'CAUSE HE'S HUNGRY? IT'S BETTER TO BE EARLY ANYWAY. OH, GOD. HE'S HERE. [ENGINE STARTS] AND, PLEASE, NO MORE JOKES ABOUT JEAN-PIERRE'S COLOGNE. IT'S NOT COLOGNE. IT'S A FIRE HAZARD. IT'S WHAT KILLED SAM'S CAT. BUTTONWILLOW GOT RUN OVER BY A CAR. CAN WE REALLY RULE OUT SUICIDE? MAYBE J.P.'s FUMES WERE TOO MUCH FOR HER, AND SHE FLUNG HERSELF UNDER THE WHEELS. HI. HOW ARE YOU? FINE. CAN WE DROP THEM IN FRONT THIS TIME? JEAN-PIERRE. COME ON. YOU'RE NOT MY BROTHER ANYMORE. WHAT? I JUST DECIDED IT. THE SAME WAY DAD ISN'T MOM'S HUSBAND ANYMORE. YOU ARE DUMBER THAN DAD'S STEPSONS. YOU CAN'T DIVORCE ME. DAD CAN TAKE YOU AWAY FOREVER, LIKE HE TOOK THE LAWNMOWER AND THE BARBECUE. THAT WOULDN'T MATTER. I'D STILL BE YOUR BROTHER WHEREVER I WAS, EVEN IF I WAS A THOUSAND MILLION MILES AWAY. I WISH YOU WERE. IS EVERYTHING O.K.? EXCUSE ME. WHO'S THAT KID OVER THERE? WELL, THAT'S YOUR BROTHER. SEE? NOT ANYMORE, I'M NOT. SAY IT ALL YOU WANT. YOU STILL CAN'T CHANGE WHO YOUR BROTHER IS. YOU'RE STUCK WITH WHATEVER YOU GET... FOREVER. WHEN I GET TO FLORIDA, I'M MAKING CURTIS AND LEON MY REAL BROTHERS 'CAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE YOU EITHER. [SHOUTING] TIME OUT! STOP THE GAME! EMERGENCY SUBSTITUTION! HO! HO! HO! THEY'RE HERE. THEY'RE HERE. EVERYTHING GO O.K., ELLEN? YEAH, FINE. AND WHAT DO WE GOT HERE? WHAT DO WE GOT IN HERE? WE GOT US A KILLER SAM! OH, A KILLER SAM. WHOA, BUDDY. OH, AND HIS GRUESOME TWIN JOSH. SO, SAM, YOU WANT TO GO OUT FOR A LONG ONE? HEY, CURTIS. ALL RIGHT. HERE. HIKE IT TO ME. READY? HIKE! OH, YES! YES! OH, THE CROWD GOES WILD! OH, GOSH, SAM. KILLER SAM, GIVE ME A BIG ONE. HEY. SO I HEAR YOU'RE HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE IN SCHOOL. IT'S O.K., EXCEPT WHEN PEOPLE MAKE FUN OF ME... LIKE JOSH. WHO'S HE TO MAKE FUN WITH THESE SKINNY LITTLE ARMS? I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO PUT ON SOME MUSCLE BEFORE YOU CAME BACK. BUT MOM MADE ME COME ANYWAY. HEY, THOM, THROW ME ONE. NO, NO, NO. JOSH'S TURN. CAN'T I JUST GO INSIDE, PLEASE? HEY, COME ON, JOSH, JUST CATCH THE BALL. LET'S SHOW THESE GUYS HOW IT'S DONE. COME ON. [WHISTLES] LET'S GO. RIGHT. YEAH. HEY, SAM, WHY DON'T YOU TELL JOSH WHAT WE HEARD YOUR DAD SAY HE'S AFRAID HE MIGHT BE. YOU TELL HIM. COME ON, SAM, DO IT. WHY? YOU GUYS ARE THE ONES WHO HEARD IT. YEAH, BUT YOU'RE HIS BROTHER. YOU SHOULD TELL HIM. A HOMOSEXUAL, O.K.? [LAUGHING] YEAH, HE WAS AFRAID YOU MIGHT BE A HOMO, BUT WE ALREADY KNOW YOU ARE. [CHUCKLING] ARE YOU GOING TO CRY NOW? CURTIS, LEON, YOU KNOCK IT OFF. DAD, CAN I BE EXCUSED NOW? AND FOR GOD'S SAKES, JOSH, JUST... CLEAN YOUR PLATE. YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK YOUR REAL DAD IS PROBABLY SOME HOMO IN CALIFORNIA. I BET YOUR MOM DID IT WITH A FAG, AND THEN YOU WERE BORN. THERE! THERE! IS THAT CLEAN ENOUGH FOR YOU, DAD? JOSH, GO TO YOUR ROOM. MY ROOM? YOU'RE IN MY DAMN ROOM. SAM... YOU'RE IN TROUBLE, JOSH, AFTER WHAT YOU DID LAST NIGHT, AND CURTIS HEARD YOU IN DAD'S OFFICE AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING. I DON'T CARE. IT DOESN'T MATTER EITHER. HOW COME? 'CAUSE I DISCOVERED SOMETHING REALLY BAD THAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU ABOUT. I ALREADY KNOW YOU'RE A HOMO. NO, SAM, THIS IS REAL. I FOUND SOMETHING SERIOUS ON DAD'S COMPUTER LAST NIGHT, SOMETHING HE'S BEEN KEEPING A SECRET ALL THIS TIME. SO? IT'S ABOUT YOU. IS NOT. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT. WHAT IS IT? WELL, THE REAL REASON WHY YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE AT SCHOOL, WHY YOU'RE ALWAYS FIGHTING WITH KIDS AT RECESS AND GETTING INTO TROUBLE, AND WHY YOU'RE GOOD AT FOOTBALL. WHY? I FOUND PROOF ON DAD'S COMPUTER THAT YOU WERE GENETICALLY ENGINEERED AND SECRETLY TRAINED TO BE A FIGHTER... A SOLDIER... A CHILD WARRIOR. YOU'RE MAKING THIS UP. NO. WHY DO YOU THINK THEY'RE ALWAYS CALLING YOU SAM? IT'S MY NAME. IT'S YOUR ACRONYM. IT'S STANDS FOR... I TOSSED SOME SECRET DOCUMENTS OUT THIS MORNING. I'LL WATCH OUT FOR DAD. GO LOOK UNDER THE WINDOW OF HIS OFFICE. GO ON. GET THEM. THIS IS ME! THIS HERE SHOWS HOW YOU WERE GENETICALLY ALTERED TO BE A FIGHTER. THIS IS THE ELECTRONIC AIMING DEVICE THEY PUT INSIDE YOUR RIGHT EYE. AND THIS DESCRIBES YOUR ENHANCED TACTICAL MENTAL POWERS FOR WAR STRATEGY. BUT I FAILED SECOND GRADE. ONLY 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T LEARN LIKE NORMAL KIDS. YOU ABSORB INFORMATION ONLY WITH SPECIAL NUMBERS AND CODED WORDS. JOSH... WHY DIDN'T THEY TELL ME? 'CAUSE THEY WERE ONLY THINKING OF THEMSELVES. WHEN THEY DELIVER YOU TO THE PENTAGON, MOM'S GOING TO USE THE MONEY TO GO TO EUROPE WITH J.P. DAD'S SENDING YOU TO FIGHT A WAR SO THE BUTTHOLES CAN GO TO FOOTBALL CAMP. I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT OR GO TO WAR. HEY, DON'T WORRY. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO. WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS QUIET, AND WE HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER. NO MORE TEAMING UP WITH CURTIS AND LEON 'CAUSE THEY'RE IN ON IT, TOO. COME ON, WE OUGHT TO GET BACK. OH! HEY, KILLER SAM! UH, JOSH, SAM... UH, THERE'S SOMETHING I GOT TO TELL YOU. I KNOW THIS IS VERY SUDDEN. TOMORROW AFTERNOON, YOU BOYS ARE FLYING BACK TO CALIFORNIA. YOU'LL PACK UP YOUR ROOMS AND SPEND THE LAST WEEK OF YOUR VACATION WITH YOUR MOTHER. SHOULDN'T YOU TALK TO THEM ALONE? NO, THIS IS A FAMILY MATTER. NOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE LIVING AS A FAMILY, WE'LL DISCUSS THIS TOGETHER. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, DAD? YOUR MOTHER CALLED LAST NIGHT. IT SEEMS THAT HER BOYFRIEND, UH, JEAN-PIERRE, ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD LIVE IN EUROPE WITH HIM FOR THE NEXT YEAR, AND SHE SAID YES. NOW? SHE'S GOING TO EUROPE NOW? THAT'S RIGHT, SAM. HOW CAN SHE PAY FOR THIS? HOW'S SHE GETTING THE MONEY? MAY I BE EXCUSED, PLEASE? IT'S NOT YOUR BUSINESS HOW SHE'S PAYING FOR THIS. JOSH, I'M NOT FINISHED! JOSH, THIS MUST MEAN THEY'RE SENDING ME TO WAR NOW. HOW CAN YOU SAY YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT? WHAT CAN YOU DO? IT SUCKS. I CAN TELL MOM I KNOW THE TRUTH. I CAN SHOW HER THE DOCUMENTS. NO! IF SHE SEES THEM, SHE'LL DESTROY THEM. THEN SHE'LL SAY I MADE IT ALL UP. COME ON, JOSH, PLEASE, YOU GOT TO HELP ME. YEAH. WELL, I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU THIS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO GET YOUR HOPES UP, BUT I READ ON THE COMPUTER ABOUT THE OTHERS ESCAPING ON THIS THING THEY CALLED THE UNDERGROUND ROADWAY. YOU MEAN LIKE A BIG LONG TUNNEL? NO, NOT--NOT EXACTLY. IT'S, UH... IT'S LIKE A SECRET ESCAPE NETWORK THAT USES BACK ROADS AND SPECIAL DRIVERS SO THAT THE ARMY WON'T CATCH THEM. TO WHERE? TO CANADA. I KNOW WHERE THAT IS. I CAN GO THERE, TOO. NO, NOT ALONE. NOT WITHOUT FINDING YOUR SUPREME COMMANDER FIRST. RIGHT DOWN THERE, RIGHT NOW, SHE'S PROBABLY LEADING A NEW GROUP TO SAFETY AND FREEDOM. THEIR COMMANDER, SHE'S A GIRL? A WOMAN... A GREAT WOMAN. I GOT TO FIND HER, JOSH. WHAT'S SHE LOOK LIKE? I DON'T KNOW. I'VE NEVER SEEN A PICTURE OF HER... BUT THE COMPUTER DESCRIBED HER AS HAVING LONG AND WAVY BLONDE HAIR AND REAL BEAUTIFUL-LOOKING... AND SHE WEARS A RED HAT WHEN SHE'S OUT ON A MISSION LEADING MUTANT CHILDREN NORTH TO CANADA. THEY DON'T KNOW HER NAME EXCEPT THAT SHE'S CALLED LIBERTY. THE LIBERTY MAID. YEAH, THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL HER. THE CAPTAIN HAS TURNED ON THE FASTEN SEAT BELT SIGN. WE ARE EXPERIENCING TURBULENCE DUE TO A STORM OVER DALLAS. WHY DIDN'T SHE COME AND GET ME, TOO? MAYBE IT'S NOT YOUR TIME YET. MAYBE YOU'RE STILL SAFE. HERE. I WANT YOU TO CHEW ON THIS FOIL, O.K.? IF YOUR BRAIN IS RUNNING AN EXCESS CHARGE, YOU SHOULD FEEL A SLIGHT ELECTRIC TINGLE IN YOUR BACK TEETH. [SIGHS] OW! OH, GOD, SAM. IT HURTS. YOU'RE ACTIVATED. IT'S A WIND SHEAR ALERT. THEY DON'T EXPECT THE AIRPORT TO OPEN TILL VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING. NO, YOU CAN'T DO THIS, MOM. SAM IS BEHAVING REAL STRANGE. I DON'T THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA. IT'S ONE NIGHT IN A HOTEL. SAM WILL BE FINE. NO, MOM, IT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOU TO LEAVE AT ALL. SAM IS ACTING EVEN WEIRDER THAN BEFORE. HE NEEDS YOU TO TAKE CARE OF HIM. YOUR FATHER WILL TAKE VERY GOOD CARE OF HIM, BUT I NEED TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF NOW. YOU UNDERSTAND, DON'T YOU? I JUST SAW JEAN-PIERRE ON 60 MINUTES CONFESSING EVERYTHING. HE WAS IN THE SHADOW, BUT I COULD TELL BY THOSE BIG LIPS OF HIS. STOP IT, JOSH. JEAN-PIERRE IS GOING TO BE PART OF OUR LIVES. NOTHING YOU SAY WILL CHANGE THAT. JOSH. JOSH! MRS. WHITNEY, YES, WE GOT YOUR NOTE. EVERYTHING'S TAKEN CARE OF. YES, THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT, JOSH, COME ON, LET'S GET YOUR BROTHER. WELL, GOOD NIGHT, BOYS. LET'S BEHAVE OURSELVES, O.K.? WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT AT THE AIRPORT? AFRICA. I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO TALK IN HERE, BECAUSE I THINK IT'S BUGGED. WHAT'S GOING ON IN AFRICA? A SECRET AND BRUTAL WAR THAT THEY WANT YOU TO FIGHT IN. THEY CAN'T DO THAT. I'M NOT GOING TO LET THEM. SO, UH, LISTEN. I'M GOING TO GO DOWNSTAIRS AND USE THE PAY PHONE AND SEE IF I CAN FIND US A DRIVER FROM THE UNDERGROUND ROADWAY. IT MAY TAKE A COUPLE OF HOURS, SO DON'T OPEN THE DOOR FOR ANYONE. DON'T TELL ANYONE WHERE I AM. WHY CAN'T I GO WITH YOU? UM, BECAUSE... THERE MAY BE A SCOUT DOWN THERE FROM THE PENTAGON. THEY KNOW WHAT A KILLER SAM LOOKS LIKE. DON'T GO ANYWHERE OR DO ANYTHING TILL I COME BACK, O.K.? [SIGHS] [BELL RINGS] SO LONG, SAM. [BELL RINGS] [MUSIC PLAYS] CAN I HELP YOU, BOY? OH. WHO ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? MY MOTHER. WHAT'S HER NAME? HERE SHE IS. MICHELLE GEARY. NO, IT CAN'T BE. THESE ARE THE ONES WHO AREN'T HERE BECAUSE OF THE AIRPORT CLOSING. SHE'S BEEN GONE FOR ALMOST TWO HOURS. SHE MUST'VE FORGOTTEN TO COME BY AND PICK UP HER BUTTON. SHE FORGOT TO GIVE ME AND MY BROTHER A ROOM KEY. THERE SHE IS. DAMN IT, MOM. MICHELLE GEARY... YOU'VE BECOME A LITTLE BOY. OH, WELL, UH, I'M NOT REALLY HER. YOU'RE RIGHT. SHE WAS BIGGER. UH, I KNOW. SHE'S MY MOM. MICHELLE IS. YES! YES, I CAN SEE IT. I SURELY CAN. [TELEPHONE RINGS] JOSH CAN'T COME TO THE PHONE 'CAUSE HE'S IN THE BATHROOM, AND HE'LL BE THERE A LONG TIME. [HOTEL MANAGER] THAT'S FINE. MAKE SURE YOU PACK YOUR BAGS TONIGHT. THEY'RE PICKING YOU UP AT 7 A.M. O.K. I REALLY OUGHT TO BE GOING. WAIT A SEC, JOSH. IS YOUR FATHER HERE? WHO DID MICHELLE FINALLY END UP WITH? I BET IT WAS SOME RICH GUY. I DON'T KNOW WHO MY FATHER IS. I DON'T EVEN KNOW HIS NAME. I REALLY BETTER BE GOING. WAIT! DID YOU MOTHER MENTION THE NAME DEREK BAXTER? UH, OH, YEAH, SURE. SHE TALKS ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME. SHE DID, REALLY? WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU LOOKING AT? MY GOD, IT COULDN'T BE HIM. IT HAS TO BE. WHO ELSE? DON'T PAY NO ATTENTION TO THEM. IT'S ALL LIES. YOUR MOTHER AND I, WE HAD SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL. I REALLY BETTER BE GOING. I'M STAYING WITH MY GRANDPARENTS. THEY'RE PICKING ME UP. HOLD ON, JOSH, JOSH, JOSH. WE GOT TO TALK SOMEWHERE. REALLY? HOW COME? BECAUSE YOUR MOTHER AND I-- JOSH, IT'S ME, SAM. UH, THIS IS MY BROTHER SAM. HE HAS PROBLEMS. YOU DON'T NEED THESE. IS THIS THE DRIVER? NO. YES! I'M DRIVING YOU BOTH TO GET A JUICY STEAK.

CALL ME DAD. THIS IS SO GREAT! WELL, HERE WE ARE. WHERE ARE WE? THIS ISN'T CANADA. DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE YOUR OWN GRANDPARENTS' HOUSE? OH, YEAH. LET'S GO IN AND TELL THEM THE NEWS. OH, WAIT. NO! NO! WE--WE REALLY CAN'T GO IN AND SURPRISE THEM BECAUSE MY GRANDFATHER HAS A BAD HEART AND IT MIGHT KILL HIM. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, JOSH? I'LL GO SEE IF THEY'RE AWAKE. YOU STAY HERE. ALL RIGHT. SUIT YOURSELF. O.K. SHIT. THAT MAN OUT THERE HAS MY BROTHER. HE'S DRUNK, AND HE THINKS HE'S MY FATHER. CAN YOU CALL THE POLICE? [DOORBELL RINGS] PLEASE CALL THE POLICE.

COME ON. COME ON. YES. IT'S O.K. JOSH, WE GOT TO GET A NEW DRIVER 'CAUSE HE'S NOT DOING THIS RIGHT. UH, IT'S O.K., DAD. YOU CAN GO NOW. NO, IT'S NOT O.K., JOSH. I HAD SOME GOOD TIMES IN THIS HOUSE. RIGHT HERE ON THIS COUCH, IN FACT. UH, LISTEN, DAD, MY GRANDPARENTS ARE COMING HOME SOON. IT'S GETTING LATE. OLD SAM WAS TELLING ME QUITE A BIT ABOUT HOW YOU DISCOVERED HE WAS REALLY A GENETICALLY ENGINEERED SOLDIER, AND I HAD TO TAKE YOU TO CANADA SO'S HE WOULDN'T BE SENT TO SOME WAR IN AFRICA. HA HA HA HA! KIDS. YEAH, KIDS. COME ON. WE GOT TO FIND SOMEONE ELSE. AHH. THIS IS MICHELLE. NOW, WHO'S THIS GUY? UH, I DON'T KNOW, BUT LISTEN, DAD, TEACH ME HOW TO PLAY POOL. DON'T YOU CALL ME THAT. THE OTHERS... THEY PUT YOU UP TO THIS, DIDN'T THEY? NO. I MADE IT UP MYSELF. I'M SORRY. I SHOULD'VE KNOWN YOU WEREN'T MINE, YOU SCRAWNY RUNT! YOU STOP THAT NOW! I OUGHT TO SNAP YOUR SCRAWNY LITTLE NECK! I WARNED YOU. AAH! IT WORKED, JOSH. MY AIMER'S ACTIVATED. YOU LITTLE SHIT! IS HE DEAD? DID YOU KILL HIM? YES. SHIT! YES, I KILLED HIM. WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE. NO, WAIT. SOMEONE WILL SEE US COMING OUT. NO, THEY'VE ALREADY SEEN US TONIGHT AT THE HOTEL. THEY'RE GOING TO KNOW I'M THE KILLER. OH, GOD! SHIT! FINGERPRINTS. THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE IN HERE. THEN WIPE THEM OFF, JOSH. OH, MY GOD, SAM, I'M A MURDERER IN TEXAS, AND THEY GIVE YOU THE LETHAL INJECTION HERE. IT'S LIKE A SHOT, BUT IT KILLS YOU. THEY EVEN GIVE IT TO MINORS. YOU GOT TO GET OUT OF TEXAS. COME WITH ME TO CANADA. CANADA? SAM, DON'T YOU SEE THAT THIS IS REAL? IT'S NOT LIKE THAT STUFF ABOUT YOU BEING A CHILD WARRIOR. I MADE ALL THAT UP. YOU LIAR. I'M SORRY, SAM. I REALLY AM. YOU ALWAYS WANT TO LEAVE ME OUT OF EVERYTHING. SAM, I REALLY MADE IT UP. THEN FORGET IT. I'LL GO BY MYSELF. WAIT. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? CANADA. GOODBYE. BUT... SAM. SAM! SAM, YOU CAN'T DRIVE A CAR. I CAN, TOO. I WATCHED MOM. I CAN GET TO CANADA ON MY OWN. SAM, YOU'RE JUST A NORMAL KID. I MADE EVERYTHING UP ON DAD'S COMPUTER. YOU DID NOT. SAM, IT'S NOT REAL. WHY ELSE WOULD MOM BE LEAVING RIGHT WHEN THE WAR IS STARTING? THERE IS NO WAR, SAM. MOM'S JUST LEAVING, THAT'S ALL. LIAR. YOU'RE TRYING TO GET RID OF ME. MOVE OVER. CANADA IS NORTH FROM HERE. I KNOW THAT. [STARTING ENGINE] PUT YOUR SEAT BELT ON. YOU GOT TO PUT THIS THING HERE ON "D." [TIRES SQUEAL] THERE! PRESS ON THAT! SHUT UP. WE'RE NEVER GOING TO GET THERE. WHERE ARE WE? JOSH, WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS AT SCHOOL? WHAT? WHAT ABOUT THEM? THEY KNEW. THEY KNEW WHAT I WAS. HOW COULD THEY KNOW? THEY HAD TO. I MADE IT UP BECAUSE I WAS MAD AT YOU. BUT EVERYONE IN SCHOOL CALLED ME ALIEN. MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE YOU WERE ALWAYS STARING OFF INTO SPACE AND--AND PLAYING BY YOURSELF AND NEVER PAYING ATTENTION IN CLASS. I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION 'CAUSE I WAS ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT BEING DEAD, LIKE GRANDMA AND BUTTONWILLOW AFTER SHE GOT HIT BY THE CAR. NOW I KNOW IT WAS ALL BECAUSE I WAS PROGRAMMED TO GIVE UP MY LIFE LIKE ALL THE OTHER KILLER SAMS. ISN'T THAT RIGHT? ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU SAID? THEN WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO LIE? WHY ARE SAYING I'M NOT WHAT YOU KNOW I AM? SAM, I'M SORRY. WELL, DON'T DO IT AGAIN. IF YOU DO, I'LL TAKE THIS CAR AND GO TO CANADA WITHOUT YOU. MMM. WHAT? SAM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? FORGET IT, JOSH. IT'S MY TURN TO DRIVE. SAM, YOU'RE GOING WAY TOO FAST. I AM NOT. LOOK, IT GOES UP TO 120. O.K., LOOK AT THE ROAD. I GOT TO FIND THE LIBERTY MAID AND THE UNDERGROUND ROADWAY TO CANADA, SO GO BACK TO SLEEP OR SOMETHING, O.K.? WE KNOW YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO DRIVE, BUT ANYONE WHO SEES YOU THINKS YOU'RE JUST A REGULAR 7-YEAR-OLD DRIVING A CAR WAY TOO FAST. IF THE POLICE SAW THAT, THEY'D SEND YOU TO THE PENTAGON. LET ME DRIVE, NOT BECAUSE I'M BETTER, WE BOTH KNOW THAT YOU'RE BETTER, BUT BECAUSE I DON'T LOOK AS STRANGE DRIVING A CAR. O.K. GREAT. FIRST, YOU HAVE TO PRESS DOWN ON THE BRAKE AND PUT THIS THING INTO "N." I GOT IT. HI. JUST CHANGING DRIVERS. OH, GOD, SAM, YOUR HEAD'S BLEEDING. I KNOW, BUT WE GOT TO KEEP GOING AND FIND THE LIBERTY MAID. WE GOT TO FIND A HOSPITAL. THEY'LL JUST FIX ME UP AND SEND ME OFF TO WAR. I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF. LOOK, I GOT MY HAND OVER IT. JOSH! THERE'S A LIGHT STREAK IN THE SKY. OH. SHOOTING STAR, PROBABLY. REALLY? WELL, IT'S NOT REALLY A STAR. IT'S, UH, IT'S LIKE A ROCK GOING THROUGH SPACE AND BURNING UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE. MOM SAID IF YOU MAKE A WISH AFTER YOU SEE ONE, IT'LL COME TRUE. SHE NEVER TOLD ME THAT. WELL, IT WAS WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE. I DON'T BELIEVE IT ANYWAY. NO. ME NEITHER. WE'RE IN COLORADO NOW. I'M HUNGRY NOW. EAT YOUR OTHER CANDY BAR. ECCHH! WHY CAN'T YOU USE THOSE CREDIT CARDS? BECAUSE THEY'RE ONLY COPIES, AND KIDS CAN'T USE CREDIT CARDS. BUT THEY'LL WORK AT A CASH MACHINE, 'CAUSE ALL IT DOES IS READ THE MAGNETIC STRIPE. I SAW J.P. USE A CREDIT CARD OVER THE TELEPHONE FOR CHINESE FOOD. SAM, YOU'RE A GENIUS. YEAH. WELL, IT'S NOT MY FAULT. THEY MADE ME THAT WAY. [ITALIAN OPERA PLAYS] IS THAT A LARGE HALF PEPPERONI, HALF PINEAPPLE, AND TWO LARGE ROOT BEERS? YES. GREAT. [ITALIAN ACCENT] UH, THIS, UH, PIZZA...

YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY O.K. I SIGN FOR HIM ALL THE TIME. ALL THE TIME. ALL THE TIME. YES... BUT MUST SIGN FOR THE DIARRHEA. YEAH? IS BETTER. YEAH, YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT. YES. YEAH, BECAUSE LAST TIME I SIGNED... YES? I LEFT A $50 TIP. WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN SIGN. O.K. WHY NOT? YOU KNOW, SAM, MOM MUST BE PRETTY WORRIED WITH US MISSING. I'M NOT EVEN A HUMAN BEING TO HER OR DAD. BUT THEY'RE STILL YOUR FAMILY. I DON'T HAVE A FAMILY ANYMORE, AND I NEVER DID. WELL, WHAT ABOUT ME? WHAT AM I TO YOU? YOU'RE MY DRIVER. YOUR BANDAGE IS FALLING OFF. YOU KNOW, SAM, AFTER I DISCOVERED THIS THING ABOUT YOU, UH, I DID A LOT OF THINKING, AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MOM AND DAD REALLY DID BEGIN TO LOVE YOU AS A NORMAL KID, AND THEY WERE GOING TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS ABOUT SELLING YOU TO THE PENTAGON. THEN WHY IS MOM-- YOUR MOM LEAVING WITH J.P.? WELL, MAYBE SHE ISN'T ANYMORE. MAYBE SHE'S WAITING TO HEAR ABOUT YOU AND KNOW THAT YOU'RE O.K. IT MAKES ME SAD TO THINK THAT YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYBODY ANYMORE. I MEAN, DOESN'T IT MAKE YOU FEEL SAD INSIDE? I'M GENETICALLY ALTERED INSIDE. I'M ALL METAL AND WIRES. IT'S COLD. I DON'T FEEL THINGS LIKE YOU DO. SAM, DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD GET IN THE CAR? I'LL SLEEP ON THE GROUND. BUT, SAM, THIS ISN'T HOME. SOMEONE COULD GET US OUT HERE, YOU KNOW, AND HURT US. DON'T WORRY. THEY WON'T TOUCH US. NOT WITH ME HERE. SAM, I WON'T TELL MOM WHERE WE ARE. I JUST WANT TO TELL HER WE'RE O.K. SHE'S ONLY WORRIED 'CAUSE SHE WON'T GET HER MONEY. TURN AROUND! THAT'LL JUST MAKE HIM MORE SUSPICIOUS. HE'LL SEE ME IF WE PASS HIM. SIT UP HIGH IN YOUR SEAT AND HOLD UP THAT MAP LIKE YOU'RE READING IT. HE DID SEE US. YOU GOT TO TURN AROUND. JOSH! KEEP THE MAP UP, SAM! THERE. WE PASSED HIM. STOP! STOP THE CAR! WHY? IT'S HER. IT'S THE LIBERTY MAID. SAM, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. IT IS NOT. I WISHED FOR HER ON 10 SHOOTING STARS LAST NIGHT. YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT. I DON'T, BUT IT WORKED. COME ON. HURRY UP! THANKS. THAT WAS CLOSE. WHERE ARE YOU ALL HEADED? SAME AS YOU. CANADA. OH? HUH. DID THAT POLICEMAN KNOW WHO YOU WERE? NO. I TOLD HIM I LIVED UP THE ROAD, AND HE BELIEVED ME. THEY'RE REAL DUMB AROUND HERE. YOU'RE THE LIBERTY MAID, AREN'T YOU? LIBERTY MAID? WELL, WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT? BECAUSE YOU LOOK EXACTLY THE WAY THE PENTAGON SAID. YOU HAVE THE RED HAT. YOU CUT YOUR HAIR. OH, JESUS. LET ME OUT OF HERE NOW. WAIT A MINUTE. I CAN EXPLAIN. WHY DO YOU WANT TO LEAVE? I'M LEAVING BEFORE DAD FINDS HIS CAR GONE. OUR DAD'S IN FLORIDA. WE'VE BEEN DRIVING FOR TWO DAYS. DON'T YOU GET IT? I'M SAM WHITNEY. "STRATEGICALLY ALTERED MUTANT." SAM, I TOLD YOU, SHE'S NOT THE LIBERTY MAID. THE PENTAGON WAS GOING TO SEND ME TO FIGHT IN AFRICA, SO MY BROTHER AND ME HAD TO ESCAPE TO CANADA. NOW YOU CAN BRING US TO THE OTHERS IN THE UNDERGROUND ROADWAY. IF YOU DRIVE THE CAR FOR US, WE'LL PAY FOR FOOD AND GAS. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. WE'LL TAKE YOU WHEREVER YOU'RE GOING. YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IT. YOU HAVE TO HELP ME. I MEAN I DON'T BELIEVE THEY HAVE THE NERVE. THEY'RE USUALLY, WHAT--18-- WHEN THEY MAKE THEM KILL PEOPLE. I'M NOT KILLING ANYONE. NO WAY. GOOD. IT'S WRONG TO KILL PEOPLE. W-WAIT A MINUTE. HOW COME YOU DIDN'T STOP THEM AND COME GET ME? BECAUSE SHE'S NOT THE LIBERTY MAID. SHE IS, TOO. MAYBE IT'S 'CAUSE WE MOVE BACK AND FORTH A LOT. MY PARENTS GOT DIVORCED AFTER THEY SOLD ME TO THE PENTAGON. I'M NOT SURPRISED. THEY USUALLY SPLIT UP AFTER THEY PULL SOMETHING LIKE THIS, AND YOU KNOW WHAT? IT REALLY PISSES ME OFF. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU, SAM. I'LL DRIVE YOU TO CANADA. JESUS, GIRL! THE NAME IS LIBERTY. LIBERTY MAID. SEE? I TOLD YOU IT WAS HER. KEEP AN EYE ON HIM, LIBERTY. MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING. DON'T WORRY. I GOT HIM COVERED. WHY DID YOU TELL HIM ALL THAT? IT'S NOT TRUE. WHO SAYS IT'S NOT TRUE? GIVE ME THE KEYS. GIVE ME A DOLLAR. I WANT A SODA. I ONLY GOT 18 CENTS. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING WITH 18 CENTS? I GOT CREDIT CARDS. I JUST NEED TO FIND A CASH MACHINE. I SHOULD'VE KNOWN. YOU LOOK LIKE THE TYPE TO CARRY PLASTIC. HEY, KOTEX HEAD, DON'T YOU KNOW THIS IS A PAY TOILET? YEAH. YOU FORGOT TO GIVE US OUR 5 BUCKS. YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE HERE. I'M NOT WHAT YOU THINK I AM. DON'T YOU GET IT? I KNOW IT'S NOT TRUE.

THAT'S MORE LIKE IT. EVER SINCE I STARTED LEADING CHILDREN OVER THE BORDER, PEOPLE CALL ME LIBERTY. IT'S O.K., JOSH. I'LL SAVE YOU, TOO. YOU'RE JUST MAKING WHAT I DID TO HIM WORSE. HE'S NEVER GOING TO STOP BELIEVING IT NOW. IF YOU DON'T THINK IT'S TRUE, TELL HIM. I TRIED, BUT HE WON'T BELIEVE ME. IT'S LIKE IT MAKES EVERYTHING MAKE SENSE FOR HIM. IT EXPLAINS ALL THE BAD THINGS. BUT... WHAT CAN I DO? I'M A WANTED MAN WITH A SCREWED-UP BROTHER. I'M A MURDERER. JOSH! WE'RE HERE-- CANADA. SAM, WAIT A SECOND. ALISON, WHERE ARE WE? I TOOK A SHORTCUT AROUND SALT LAKE, AND I GOT STUCK HERE. GOT STUCK? HOW? [ENGINE RUMBLING] I RAN OUT OF GAS. HERE YOU GO, SON. AND I'LL HOLD YOUR CHANGE TILL YOU BRING THE CAN BACK. O.K. THANKS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WE GOT TO GO. WE'VE BEEN WALKING ALL MORNING. IT'S TIME TO REST. HERE. EAT YOUR BREAKFAST. YOU EAT. I'LL TAKE THIS TO THE CAR AND DRIVE BACK AND GET YOU. YOU'RE NOT. I HAVE TO. HUH? WHY'S IT SO IMPORTANT? COME HERE. YOU'VE GOT US HERE. SAM, WHAT'S WRONG? OH, GOD. IT'S O.K., SAM. HE DOESN'T KNOW. YOU'RE JUST A NORMAL BOY. HE DOES KNOW. HE DOES NOW. SAM, YOU CAN'T LOOK AT PEOPLE LIKE THAT. MORNING, OFFICER. HI. I'M THEIR BABYSITTER. PARENTS HIRED ME TO TAKE THEM OUT FOR A LITTLE MORNING DRIVE, TOUR THE DESERT. MMM... YOU SEE, OUR CAR RAN OUT OF GAS, SO... YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE-- CAN I SEE IT, PLEASE? SURE. HANNIBAL, MISSOURI? THAT'S A LONG MORNING DRIVE. WELL, WE JUST MOVED HERE... TO UTAH...OGDEN. ME AND MY PARENTS DID. I WANT TO CALL THE BOYS' PARENTS. WELL, THEY DON'T HAVE A TELEPHONE. YEAH, OF COURSE THEY DO. THEY JUST GOT ONE. THEY CAN TELL YOU ALL ABOUT ALISON. GOOD. I'D LIKE TO HEAR ALL ABOUT ALISON. OH, WAIT. I'M GOING TO NEED THE TDD MACHINE FROM YOUR CAR. HUH? YOU KNOW, THE TDD MACHINE. BOTH MY PARENTS ARE DEAF. I DON'T HAVE ONE OF THOSE. HOW DO YOU TALK TO DEAF PEOPLE OVER THE PHONE? I DON'T TALK TO DEAF PEOPLE. MOM AND DAD TOLD ME THERE'D BE PLACES LIKE THIS. PEOPLE LIKE THEM WEREN'T WANTED, WHERE THEY COULDN'T EVEN USE THE PHONE IF A BURGLAR WAS AROUND. THEY'D JUST DIE, AND NO ONE WOULD EVEN CARE, ESPECIALLY NOT THE POLICE WHO DON'T CARRY TDD MACHINES SO THEY CAN HEAR THEIR CALLS FOR HELP. THIS IS SOME KIND OF JOKE, ISN'T IT? OH, YEAH. SURE. MAYBE IT'S A JOKE TO YOU, MISTER. MAYBE THAT'S ALL YOU DO AROUND HERE IS JOKE ABOUT DEAF PEOPLE BEHIND THEIR BACKS. BUT LET ME TELL YOU ONE THING. THEY CAN DO THE SAME THING TO YOU. COME ON. LET'S GO. I'M REALLY GOING TO MISS YOU GUYS. WHY? WHERE ARE YOU GOING? [SIREN] COME ON. LET'S RUN FOR IT. WE CAN'T RUN. IT'S TOO LATE. I CAN TALK TO THIS GUY. I KNOW I CAN TALK HIM OUT OF THIS. HEY, BACK AT THE STATION, WE GOT A TDD MACHINE. OH. GREAT. UM... UH, I'LL GO CALL THEM. YOU GUYS STAY HERE, O.K.? NO. ALL OF YOU. WHERE'S HE GOING? SAM, WAIT! NO, SAM! ALISON, THE FLAT CAR! COME ON! ALISON, COME ON! COME ON! GET OFF THAT NOW! I LOST THOSE KIDS! THEY'RE ON FOOT, AND THEY'RE HEADING FOR THE LAKE. SAM! UHH! STOP IT! DON'T MAKE ME HURT YOU! YOU COULD'VE GOTTEN KILLED BY THAT TRAIN! I WAITED TILL THE WHEELS WENT BY. YOU COULD'VE GOTTEN CHOPPED IN HALF! GET! GET IN THE CAR! NOW! COME ON. [SIREN] O.K. IT'S SAFE NOW. WHY ARE YOU SO MAD AT ME? YOU KNOW WHAT I AM. HERE. SIZE 8. SIZE 12. WHO WAS THAT GUY? HEY, ANYBODY HERE GO BY LIBERTY 005? YEAH. HONEY, THAT'S THE STRANGEST NAME I EVER HEARD OF. FIGHT OR FLIGHT TO THE 49th. YEAH, IT'S ME. O.K. BYE. WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT'S WRONG? WHO WAS THAT? THE SECRET WAR IN AFRICA... IT'S OVER. YOU CAN GO HOME NOW. [ALISON] IT'S JUST THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT THE PENTAGON NEVER EXPECTED. WHAT? WHAT HAPPENED? IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN, BUT YOU KNOW HOW YOU HAVE ENHANCED MENTAL POWERS LIKE YOU CAN REMEMBER THINGS? YEAH. AND YOU ALSO KNOW HOW YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF DANGER LIKE OTHERS ARE. YEAH. WELL, WHAT HAPPENED IN AFRICA WAS THAT WHEN THE FIGHTING BROKE OUT, THOSE TWO QUALITIES THAT ALL THE KILLER SAMS HAVE COMBINED TOGETHER TO MAKE THEM STOP FIGHTING. AND SO THEY PUT DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND ALL STOOD UP TOGETHER AND SAID THEY WERE MORE WILLING TO DIE THAN TO KILL ANOTHER PERSON. AND THAT'S IT? THAT'S HOW IT ENDED? UH-HUH. MY CONTACT TOLD ME THAT ALL THE KILLER SAMS WERE DEACTIVATED BY SATELLITE LAST NIGHT, AND IT WAS ALL OVER BY THE TIME YOU WOKE UP THIS MORNING. STOP THE CAR. POINT TO A LETTER. UH... THE "P" IN PASS. MMM. THERE. WHAT ABOUT THAT? WELL, MAYBE THEY HAVEN'T DONE IT YET. OR MAYBE THEY HAVEN'T 'CAUSE THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO. MAYBE IT'S ALL A LIE. HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT? SHE'S GONE BAD, JOSH. SHE MADE THAT UP SO SHE CAN GET RID OF ME. NO ONE'S GETTING RID OF YOU. WE'RE GOING TO CANADA TOGETHER. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO HOME UNTIL YOU'RE READY. HOW CAN I BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU'RE THE ONE TELLING ME? UM... I'LL SLEEP ON THE FLOOR, O.K.? NO. THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM. GOOD NIGHT, LITTLE BROTHERS. HE'S GOING TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT. HE'S GOING TO DRIVE THAT CAR OFF A CLIFF. HE'S BEEN GONE ALL MORNING. YOU CAN BET THE POLICE HAVE CAUGHT HIM BY NOW. GREAT. THEY'LL SEND HIM BACK TO FLORIDA. IT DOESN'T SOUND SO BAD THERE. IT WILL BE IF HE THINKS MY DAD SOLD HIM TO THE PENTAGON. I STARTED THIS. I SCREWED UP HIS THINKING. I HAVE TO FIND HIM AND MAKE HIM BETTER. HOW? YOU CAN'T DO EVERYTHING, JOSH. YOU'RE JUST A 12-YEAR-OLD KID. THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK OF ME? HEY... LISTEN, I REALLY LIKE YOU, JOSH. I DO. I MEAN, YOU'RE SMART, AND YOU'RE REAL FUNNY, AND YOU'RE BRAVE. I WANT YOU TO COME WITH ME. HUH? LISTEN... THIS IS ALL ABOUT SEATTLE, WASHINGTON. THIS MAGAZINE RATES IT AS THE MOST LIVABLE CITY IN THE COUNTRY. SEE? LOOK AT THESE HOUSES BY THE WATER DOWN THERE. I CAN'T GO THERE. YOU KNOW THAT I CAN'T. MAYBE YOU DIDN'T REALLY KILL THAT GUY. IF YOU JUST HIT HIM ON THE HEAD ONCE, YOU PROBABLY KNOCKED HIM OUT. I TOOK HIS PULSE-- NOTHING. WELL, MAYBE YOU TOOK IT WRONG. HUH? I GOT TO FIND SAM. STAY SAFE, LITTLE MAN. GOODBYE. [HORN HONKS] SAM? SAM! DAMN IT. [ENGINE RUMBLES] [ENGINE RUMBLES] YES, DADDY, I SAW THE TRUCK, BUT I DIDN'T SEE ANYONE ON TOP OF IT. I SAW HIM BEHIND THAT THING UP THERE LESS THAN A MINUTE AGO. MM-HMM. O.K., DEAR, WELL, I'M SURE HE'S FLOWN AWAY BY NOW. LOOK. THERE HE IS AGAIN. DADDY, PLEASE. OH, MY GOD. SAM? SAM! SAM! GET BACK TO YOUR SEAT. B-BUT MY BROTHER'S IN THAT TRUCK RIGHT THERE. GET BACK. YOU HAVE TO STOP THAT TRUCK. SAM! SAM! YOU CAN TELL IT ALL TO THE BORDER GUARD. HEY! SAM? SAM? SAM. SAM. SAM? GET DOWN NOW. COME ON. SAM. HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP THERE? HEY! COME ON. WE GOT TO GET TO CANADA. WE'RE IN CANADA, SAM. THERE'S THE BORDER. IT'S NOT ANY DIFFERENT. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT YOU'RE SAFE NOW. HERE. HOLD THIS. WHY DIDN'T YOU GO WITH LIBERTY? BECAUSE I HAD TO COME AND FIND YOU. OH. SHE WASN'T THE LIBERTY MAID, WAS SHE? NO. SHE WAS JUST A GIRL... RUNNING AWAY FROM SOMETHING, LIKE US. SOMETHING BAD, I THINK. I THINK I KNEW IT ALL ALONG, BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT. [URINATING] SOMETHING WRONG, SAM? WHAT IS IT? YOU CAN TELL ME. NO PLACE TO GO. I KNOW, BUT GUESS WHAT. WHAT? I DON'T HAVE ANY PLACE TO GO, EITHER. THANKS FOR THE RIDE. OPEN 24 HOURS. COME ON. COME ON. IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT HERE? IT WILL BE IF YOU LET US STAY. YOU STAY AS LONG AS YOU WANT. THANKS. I'M SORRY, JOSH. WHAT FOR? YOU'RE ONLY HERE 'CAUSE YOU SAVED ME FROM THAT DEREK GUY. WELL, YOU... YOU SAVED ME, TOO, BY THROWING THAT POOL BALL AT HIM. I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE LET THEM SELL ME. AND IF I HADN'T BEEN GENETICALLY ALTERED, I NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SUCH A PROBLEM TO YOU... AND YOU'D BE AT HOME NOW. I THINK WE WOULD HAVE BEEN FRIENDS ALL ALONG. YEAH. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO EVER HELPED ME. WHAT'S GOING ON? WHERE ARE WE GOING? WHAT WOULD YOU THINK ABOUT FLYING BACK TO ORLANDO AND LIVING AT DAD'S HOUSE LIKE A NORMAL BOY? I'M NOT A NORMAL BOY. IT'S NOT SAFE FOR ME IN THAT COUNTRY. YOU KNOW THAT. LOOK, SAM. I WAS READING YOUR PAPERS LAST NIGHT. I DISCOVERED I COULD MAKE IT SAFE FOR YOU BY BURNING OUT YOUR CIRCUITS-- EVEN IF YOU COULD BURN OUT MY CIRCUITS, THEY'D PUT NEW ONES IN. I ALREADY THOUGHT OF THAT. BUT THE PROBLEM IS THEY ALTERED ME EVERYWHERE, MY CELLS AND ALL THAT. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO ALTER CELLS BACK AND BURN OUT CIRCUITS AT THE SAME TIME. HOW IS THAT? RADIATION. IONIZING RADIATION. HUH? OH, DON'T WORRY. THIS IS JUST A FRONT. HEY! I SAID NOT THE FRONT DOOR. JESUS, I COULD GO TO JAIL FOR THIS, GIVING GAMMA RAYS TO AN AMERICAN, ESPECIALLY A MINOR. YOU EVER DONE THIS BEFORE? OH, YEAH. I GET AN ALTERED MUTANT HERE EVERY WEEK. MOST OF THEM ARE ON THE UNDERGROUND RIVER. YOU MEAN THE ROADWAY. RIGHT, BUT AFTER THE EXACT AMOUNT OF RADIATION, THEY'RE JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. YOU CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE. ARE YOU READY, SAM? YES, READY. LISTEN, HAVE YOU GOT A WORD PROCESSOR? I GOT A TYPEWRITER. HOW ABOUT A FAX MACHINE? YEAH, SURE, BUT YOU KNOW... THANK YOU. PLEASE, THIS WAY. SO HOW DOES IT FEEL, SAM? STILL COLD AND METALLIC INSIDE? NO, IT FEELS GOOD AND WARM LIKE HUMAN FLESH, BUT I DON'T HAVE A TICKET. DON'T WORRY. I ALREADY TOOK CARE OF THAT. YOU JUST LOOK SAD, REAL SAD. REALLY? HOW COME? BOTH HIS PARENTS WERE KILLED LAST NIGHT IN A CAMPING ACCIDENT. HIS UNCLE, THOMAS WHITNEY, FAXED THIS AND PREPAID A ONE-WAY FARE TO ORLANDO. A PROPANE STOVE EXPLOSION? IS THAT WHY HIS FACE LOOKS LIKE THAT? YEAH, HE'S PRETTY SHOOK UP ABOUT IT. IS ALL THE PAPERWORK HERE? YES, IT'S ALL HERE. YOU KNOW, JOSH, YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT MAKING UP STUFF. OH, WELL, YOU BETTER KEEP THAT TO YOURSELF. ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS WAIT RIGHT HERE. I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE AND GET YOU A REALLY GOOD SEAT, O.K.? YOU FORGOT ALL ABOUT MY SPECIAL MENTAL POWERS, MY ENHANCED MEMORY AND ALL THAT. THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ALTERED BACK 'CAUSE I HAD THAT THING ON MY FACE. KEEP THEM. YOU DESERVE SOMETHING FOR ALL THE STUFF THEY PUT YOU THROUGH. I WISH THERE WAS SOME WAY YOU COULD TAKE BACK THE MURDER, MAKE IT BETTER SO YOU CAN COME BACK WITH ME. YEAH, I WISH THAT, TOO. BUT EVEN IF I COULD, I DON'T THINK I'D GO BACK TO FLORIDA. WHY NOT? YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR ME THERE, HOW DAD THINKS OF ME. I'D DO BETTER BY MYSELF. YEAH, BUT I'LL BE THERE, AND NOW I LIKE YOU. WOULDN'T THAT BE ENOUGH? MAYBE. EITHER WAY, THERE'S NO POINT IN WONDERING. I STILL CAN'T GO. YEAH, WELL, EVEN THOUGH I'M GOING BACK TO LIVE WITH DAD, I ALREADY DECIDED I'M NOT GOING TO TALK TO HIM. YOU'VE GOT TO TALK TO HIM. AFTER WHAT HE DID TO ME? SOMETIMES PEOPLE DO STUFF BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER, AND THEN LATER THEY FIND OUT THAT IT WASN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA AFTER ALL. BUT DAD STILL DID IT, AND I CAN'T EVER FORGET BECAUSE I STILL HAVE ENHANCED MEMORY. O.K. BUT YOU ALSO HAVE SOMETHING THAT CAME ALONG WITH THAT THAT I BET YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT. IT'S A REAL STRONG MENTAL POWER THAT LETS YOU FORGIVE PEOPLE, EVEN IF YOU CAN'T FORGET WHAT THEY'VE DONE, AND IT'S ALSO THE POWER TO TRUST AND NEVER BE WORRIED OR EVEN SCARED. WHEREVER YOU ARE NOW AND HOWEVER BAD IT IS, YOU CAN ALWAYS MAKE IT BETTER JUST BY USING THIS POWER. SAM, WE HAVE TO BOARD NOW. WHEN AM I GOING TO SEE YOU AGAIN? I DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T TELL YOU WHERE I AM UNTIL I'M SURE THEY WON'T COME AFTER ME. THIS ISN'T WORKING. I WANT TO STAY WITH YOU. COME ON. JUST REMEMBER THAT I'LL ALWAYS BE YOUR BROTHER, AND I'M STILL GOING TO BE YOUR BEST FRIEND NO MATTER WHERE I AM. SO GO BACK AND DO WHAT I SAID, O.K.? BYE, SAM. REMEMBER YOUR POWER. OW! OH, NO. OF COURSE IT HURTS. THE FOIL REACTS WITH THE SILVER IN YOUR FILLINGS. YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS? EVERYONE DOES, EVERYONE WHO HAS FILLINGS. SAMMY. SAM? [RINGING] [RING] [RING] YEAH. UM, IS THIS DEREK BAXTER? THIS IS THE KID, ISN'T IT? THIS IS THAT DAMN KID, ISN'T IT? CALM DOWN. I CALLED TO SAY I'M SORRY, AND I'M GLAD YOU'RE ALIVE. DON'T YOU TELL ME THAT, YOU LITTLE SHIT! HE DIDN'T TELL ME 'CAUSE HE KNEW THE POLICE WOULD COME AFTER HIM, THEN HE'D HAVE TO DIE BY THE LETHAL INJECTION. SAM, JOSH DIDN'T KILL ANYONE. I TALKED TO THE POLICE IN DALLAS. HE ONLY KNOCKED THE MAN OUT. I HAVE TO GO BACK AND FIND JOSH AND TELL HIM THE TRUTH. IF YOU GOT ANY IDEA WHERE JOSH IS, YOU HAVE TO TELL ME. DID HE SAY ANYTHING AT ALL? WHY DO YOU CARE, DAD? YOU NEVER LIKED JOSH, ANYWAY. SAM, OF COURSE I LIKE JOSH. I LOVE JOSH. HE'S MY SON. BUT HE WASN'T THE WAY YOU WANTED HIM TO BE 'CAUSE YOU WERE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE HIM DIFFERENT. SAM, NOTHING IS EVER THE WAY WE WANT IT TO BE. I ALWAYS WANTED TO HAVE ONE FAMILY AND MY CHILDREN TO HAVE ONE HOME, BUT I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT. I ALWAYS WANTED JOSH TO BE TOUGHER AND STRONGER THAN I WAS BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT A CRUEL AND MEAN WORLD IT IS. I JUST WANTED JOSH TO BE READY FOR THAT. THEN YOU MUST HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB. WHY DO YOU SAY THAT? 'CAUSE I THINK JOSH LIKES THE CRUEL AND MEAN WORLD BETTER THAN HOME. THERE YOU GO, SWEETIE. YEAH, HE WAS WEARING A BLUE DENIM JACKET. JOSH REALLY DID KILL A GUY? MY DAD'S JUST TRYING TO COVER FOR HIM, BUT I SAW IT. HE BEAT HIM OVER THE HEAD WITH A POOL STICK, HE WAS SO MAD. WHAT FOR? WHY WAS HE SO MAD? The guy called him a homo. SEE THAT? I CAN STILL AIM A FOOTBALL AFTER YOU BURNED OUT ALL MY CIRCUITS, AND I USED MY SPECIAL MENTAL POWERS TO PASS ALL MY TESTS, SO I DON'T HAVE TO BE HELD BACK, SO I'M GOING TO START THE THIRD GRADE TOMORROW. OH, THAT'S GREAT. DON'T YOU THINK? YOU LIED TO ME, JOSH. IT WAS ALL A LIE. I COULD HAVE GOTTEN KILLED BY THAT DRUNK GUY AND CRASHED THE CAR AND GOTTEN RUN OVER BY THAT TRAIN AND FALLEN OFF THAT TRUCK AND GOTTEN BEATEN UP BY THOSE BIG KIDS 'CAUSE YOU MADE ME WEAR A KOTEX ON MY HEAD! I TRIED TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, SAM, BUT YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME. WHY'D YOU COME BACK? BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE. I CAME BACK TO BE WITH YOU. I'M SORRY, SAM. JOSH, THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO TELL YOU. WHAT'S THAT? WELL, WHEN I GOT HOME, DAD LEFT HIS SAFE OPEN, AND I FOUND THIS BIG FILE INSIDE. SO? IT WAS ABOUT YOU.
