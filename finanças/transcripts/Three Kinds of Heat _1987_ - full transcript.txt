[video] To Chief executive officer Black Lion corporation. From the Founder. Let's this be a warning to all personnel. I want this internal warfare to stop Prescott Chang dies because of your stupid dangerous dispute. Dangerous because, it calls attention to Black Lion. Any one of you who sends a message boy against a member of Black Lion will receive a message from me. There will be no more factions. I won't have it. So that's the founder. But who is this message for? I mean is it for lieutenants? Chinese triads wasting each other Just one big unhappy family. [dull sound] [gunshots] [Terry] Take them out. Are you crazy?

Jingmao You're long way from home ShanShan We're looking for Harry Pimm. Harry Pimm, he don'’t like people come looking for him. Well we didn't come to arrest him. What are you here for? [Cromwell] Information. We want the name of the Founder. [foreign language] Jingmao! One shot, take them both out. Is not worth the risk. The squad car is outside let's take them in the street. [Cromwell] It's not them. You know I know her from Hong Kong Angelica, she work for Black Lion. Angelica Bethencourt, she travels with Harry. How do you know her name? Passport violations. Pictures posted all over the pacific base. Do we take her? No way. She's gonna bring us right to hell Yeah but what about the message boys? Forget them. Angelica is more important, if she's here Harry is around. Come with me, come on. [car door closing] I just can't believe Harry'’s gonna let, Angelica leave on her own. Afraid she might go back to former employer. Employer? She never worked a day in her life? Yes indeed. Before Angelica found true love and hapiness with Harry Pimm, she used to work for Madame Pilou full time [Shan] Number one hooker in Hong Kong A hooker huh? Yes, and we're talking world class here I mean not that I'’d know anything about it personally Madame Pilou is what you might call vice-president in charge of prostitution, white slavery. Rent a boy. [Terry] How many divisions of this Black Lion have? Rent a boy?! Hundreds! They've gotta be the fastet growing conglomerate'’s of the big board. Rent a boy? No sign of Harry. Believe me, Angelica is still our best bet to find him But Harry is a clever little rat. Maybe he need Jingmao and Eddie Wing for decoy Come here to the airport early and take flight out of country. I'm telling you she's gonna meet him somewhere. Or she's gonna lead us away from him. No way, I told you their two hearts beat as one. Barnes, Kelly come here. We need to borrow your belt radios. Tell Kaufman to issue your replacements. Keep an eye on the squad car. Ok, let's go. We'll be with you in one moment. Got it, she's booked first class to London, the next flight out. [Intercom] Flight 201 to London, now boarding at gate 3 That's it, meet me at the gate. Please help this gentleman, thank you. [man at the gate] your boarding pass please. So? let's get going. Get going where? We're going to follow her This plane is going to London. And so are we. Now? London? I've never been out of the country. Today'’s your lucky day. This pass will get us all on board, courtesy of Interpol. I can't, I don't have anything packed, I left my cap in the station and I have a cat. Look, Sergeant, you're been assigned to me. So, consider this an order: you're going to London. Well, you're the CO. You got that right. Hello, operations, this is Sergeant O'shea. In case anyone asks, I just went to London. And tell Kaufmann to feed my cat. Hot sake Sherry Champagne I'll go up forward, keep an eye on Angelica. Well Sergeant, here we are, off to London. Slicker and slicker, you sure have everything under control. Things do do look rather promising don'’t they. So do you have a nice hotel picked out for us in London? I'm working on it. Yeah, I just bet you are. I'm sure we'll find a suitable accommodations. Suitable. Suitable for who? Why...for all three of us, of course. Yeah with you in the middle. Wow, here is to my... measuring up. In your dreams. Well, if you'’ll excuse me, Angelica knows what Shan looks like, I better make sure she keeps out of sight. Besides, I'm feeling a bit of a chill here. [Shan] Angelica is out of it. I'll bet you 50$ she went into restroom to... snort white powder. Nah, she eats reds. Up or down she still doesn't know what's going on. Don't worry about it, come on. Elliot Cromwell? That's right, what can I do for you? I'm Chuck Peterson the flight engineer. The captain signed a clearance on your request to go under the cargo hold. The tag names that you requested would be in part 9 Thanks. We can't go there and just open luggage. We don't have a search warrant. You gotta be kidding. It's against the law. Over the ocean, no longer under US jurisdiction. And besides, they told me Angelica is smuggling drugs. Does she? She pops a few red pieces open every now and then. Red pieces? Yeah Looks like cough drops made of opium Chinese get high, call it chasing the dragon. I don't wanna hear. Now, yes or no? It's a lot of trouble to access the hatch of a cargo tank. The answer is yes, we'll inspect the luggage. [Cromwell] Come on. What do you got? This is it, all the big ones here [Cromwell] Rather formal don't you think? [Shan] Haute couture. [Terry] Call the mayor, this must have cost a fortune. [Shan] You like pretty dress? [Terry] Of course I like pretty dresses. Don't you? [Cromwell] What'’s this here? Barbell? I don't get it She must pump iron. It'’s pure pig iron. No drugs anywhere. It's obvious Angelica is up to something. The question is what? Here, thanks a lot. Cromwell! Georges Norris I was afraid I was might miss you [Cromwell] Excuse me? We met at the Shangai sector about three years ago. We worked for the same company, George Norrison. Yeah sure, sure. [Georges] I would like to have a word with you in private. I'm a little pressed for time right now Georges. Instructions. Instructions, Yeah In the coffee shop. I gotta talk to this guy he'’s from interpol, alright. And whatever you do make sure you don't lose Angelica Well how I do contact you? [Cromwell] I'll meet you at 5 O'clock. Please call the Mercury Courier office in Covent Garden on Kingstreet. Ask anybody, they will tell you how to get there. Okay, go on. Interfering with the surveillance. Now, what the hell is so important? Interpol want to see you. I've been ordered to bring you in. Bring me in? I'm US council, department of state with diplomatic immunity What are you talking about? Screw that Cromwell. State issued the order. But why? I think it got something to do with. women Major Shan is a woman and sergeant O'shea is a woman O'shea and Shan are dedicated professionals, sir. You should see them in action. You can't replace them we are. On to something really important here. I have no intention in replacing them. I'm sorry Cromwell, you're no longer assigned to operation fireworks. What about Harry Pimm? What about the name of the Founder? Special agent Norris will now take over. Major Shan, sergeant O'shea will now be answerable to him. Well if tht's the case, sir, perhaps it is the time I hand in my resignation. I wouldn't try that if I were you Cromwell. We might just accept it. Alright Norris, you take over, we are counting on you. Kirkland just cross me off your list. Gentlemen I'm now in the private sector. I resign. Good. [Shan] Talk about a shopping spree. This is her fifth dress shop. Seventh. So is the same thing, this woman is an evening gown freak. At least we know where she stays, because we stakeout the hotel. [Terry] Speaking of hotels, what about Cromwell? [Shan] What about him? We gotta meet him at the airlines carry office. It's 5 o'clock. Kingstreet, Covent Garden Now, which way is Covent Garden? I don't know, maybe he knows. [unintelligible directions] Did you hear what I just heard? All sounds alike I think he said Covent Gardens is doon [down] that way. - Doon. - Okay. Here it is Mercury couriers. Look, man who met Cromwell at airport. [Terry] Yeah, but I don't see Cromwell. Major Shan, Sergeant O'shea, please come in. My name is Georges Norris. Do please sit down. Where is Cromwell? We're supposed to meet him here. I'm afraid that won't be possible. Cromwell's been transferred out, I'm his replacement. Just like that Nobody told us Kirkland orders. Hence I hear Finch. They're expecting you to call for confirming. Yeah, I'm gonna call NY Interpol. Be my guest. I have here a set of revised orders for each of you, naming me in Cromwell's place. Interpol Global pull strings we jump. Look, correct code file. So where do we go from here? Well, I've hoped you'd be keeping a tight watch on Angelica Bethencourt We leave her, to come here to meet Cromwell. All she does is shop for dresses. We have her hotel pinned down. Good. Reseem surveillance, report every half hour. I'll be covering Heathrow. If Pimm slips by he'’ll make straight for the bait, don't let Angelica out of your side, any questions? How do we contact you? Channel A9 on the UHF band. As I said, every half hour. Good luck. Ten-four [door closes] Georges Norris calling Interpol. Surveillance proceeding according to plan. I have everything in good order, Norris out. [Shan] What do you think of new boss? You've seen one agent, you've seen them all, right? Old saying. Never change Ox in middle of rice patty. Angelica! Back to the shopping spree. Sergeant O'shea to Norris. Time is 6PM, target has just entered a clothing establishment [Terry] The address is 121 Argo street. Sign outside says Adriana's. We're gonna check it out, over and out. What do you think? More evening gowns? Oh I know Black Lion is not in dress business [Shan] Now, what is Adriana's? [Shan] Excuse please, what is Adriana's? [man] Good question! Now if it'’s High fashion we're after, Then she'’s is the latest range. The runaway girls go on right after tea time. If you don't wanna miss the main event, you best hurry. Thanks, do you wanna see a fashion show? What about uniforms? Come on we go to the back door. Let's go I wanna see. - Okay. - This way. [woman] Rachel put your hair up. [women talking] [80s music] [women talking] Excuse me, please. This unfortunately, is one of the ones We cannot... use [Shan] We should go upfront. [Terry] We cannot go upfront or anywhere wearing these uniforms. I've always wanted to wear one of these. Look... Look at this one. Just my size. What about me? All wrong size. Look that's how many changing rack are over there. So go over there and find something to wear. Then meet me in the dressing room. [woman] Alice in how much longer will you be? Not one minute, you don't have one minute. How much longer will you be Allison? Not just a minute, you'’re on! Forgive me, I'm very sorry. [woman] Have you seen her? This didn't work. This here, that doesn'’t work either Split the difference, I'’ve got the stuff in the backroom [fashion talk] Cromwell. What are you doing here? Oh I was just keeping an eye on Angelica. And you. You've been replaced. I mean Norris told us you're off this case. Officially yes, I've been relieved of duty, but hum unofficially, wanted to keep in contact. With who? With you. They've gotten you orders, I mean, Norris is our new CEO. I didn't wanna just disappear and leave you with a lot of loose ends. I notice you're out of your uniform Yeah, hum, the uniforms were a little bit too advert around here, so I change into something less conspicuous Yeah By the way, where is, where would Major Shan be, right now? She is in the locker [Shan] Let her go! Cromwell? Where the hell did you come from? Don't worry, no problem. This is no problem, this is just a slight shoulder separation. Why don't you go on and change. I'm gonna look around and see if I can find anything. Unofficially, off the record. How do I know? I thought he was off the case. He is. Looks to me like he is on. Okay, where is your dress? Oh, all too big or too small. Really? Well I just happen to find the perfect thing. One size fits all. [people talking] [ringtone] Who is this? Your associate colleague calling from London. We are probably taped, use the scrambler. [man over the phone] We've deposited payment in your account in credit. Do we have a deal? In case i'm exposed, I want asylum in Bangkok. You have my personal guarantee of safe passage. I've managed to get Elliot Cromwell, relieved of duty. I'm now in command of operation fireworks. Good, what's your step? NY police can be tricky. And major Shan'’s a bullbuster Any word as to when Harry Pimm'’s arriving in London? There'’s no sign of him here in Manhattan. So he's probably in flight now. As soon as he contacts Angelica, let your police dogs fight it out with his bodyguards, while they are all busy chewing on each other, you get in close to Harry and kill his ass dead. Have you got that Norris? Dead. If Harry lives we'’ve had it. I promised delivery, I'm not gonna let Pimm divert it. If I don't deliver, we're dead. But the Founder ordered no more infighting. That's why I'm letting George do it. [80s music] Excuse me, the finale is starting, you better get out there. Did you find anything? I think so, but I'll tell you about it later, come on. Better get upfront. You'’re not dressed. This is it. Yeah, yeah. Let's go! [80s music] Harry, back row, center. Okay. [Shan] Did you see Eddie Wing? No, maybe they're guarding the door. [throbbing] [Terry] Seargeant O'shea calling Norris. Norris here. Where? Here at Adriana's in the audience. Receive your message [Terry] Harry Pimm is back row, center. Armed and dangerous. And look for two hoods, somewhere near him. I've got him in my sights. Ten-four Don't shoot. What the fuck? We're supposed to take him alive. Harry the police, Major Shan, hurry! [Shan] Come on Angelica Angelica! [people screaming] [gunshots] [Cromwell] You were just shooting at the wrong guy. Bollocks. This is Norris, calling from London. Pimm was dead and buried, but Cromwell buggered in and blocked my shot. Cromwell? I thought you replaced him. I did, but he's come back on his own. So take him out. [Norris] I can't get past those two man-eaters. Don't give me this shit, Norris. I'm paying you to blow up Harry Pimm. I wanna see his corpse or I'm gonna see yours. Hey, where is Norris? Oh he's over Adriana's Office, phoning in his report. I got a funny felling he'’s trying to get me deported. This is Norris, emergency. I'm at Adriana's and my car is in the parking area. Here'’s the silver diamond licence number: RUC 306Y. I want it wired. That is correct, plastique. Use a timer, set it for 7:30 to the second. Woah, George did you file your little report? Say goodbye Cromwell. Goodbye Cromwell. At least you got Angelica. And Adriana's under arrest. Adriana? What the hell for? For smuggling dresses. Cromwell go away. Officer! would you be so kind as to wheel those dress racks in here, please. If you see anything you like George, just pick it out. Very good, very good. George, If you seek, And you shall find. Gold! [Cromwell] 9-9-9 pure, straight from the London exchange. [Terry] Woah, boullion, this ingot weighs a ton. I don't understand, how can they smuggle lumps this size. That's a good question, don't you think George? If you allow me, excuse me. Now, what do you suppose we have here? What the hell is it for? This is an extrusion machine George. What did he say? He said - what? This little gadget here, makes gold wire. You place an ingot in here. Voilà! Gold thread spins out here. See, Adriana has a backroom industry full of garment workers who weave this gold into bolts of material Then her seamstresses cut the patterns and come up with a 24k creation. Talk about high fashion That's why Angelica collects all these evening gowns. She's got proof of purchase, labels, custom declorations. She simply switches the dresses. The cheap stufs stays here, the gold gowns go out. No wonder Angelica brings in a barbell. Overweight luggage comes in, Dump out dumb-bell, put in gold dresses, same overweight luggage goes out past customs. [Cromwell] You've got that quite right. What are we gonna do about this Angelica? Gee I don't know, George is your CO. The target is still Harry Pimm. She is his Achilles' heel, Sooner or later he'll come within range. Cut her loose. Let her go? You're free to go. So, you can tell me? You heard her Angie baby, take a hike. Continue surveillance and let's get moving. Come on I got a rented car across the street. We'll use mine: Silver diamond parked around the back. [Cromwell] Alright, come on let's go. Where is it? Cromwell! Did you just save my life? I think so. An old chinese proverb say: "If you save a man's life you're responsible for him, forever" - Huh? - Yeah. [Norris] Someone tried to kill me! [Cromwell] Let's get out of here, we'll take my car. Sorry sir, you can't come through this. It's ok, it's alright, come on come on. Check it first. They're not after me George, I'm retired, remember? Let me drive, I'm excellent at tailgating. No, you drive on the wrong side of road, come on. Oh yeah that's right, let's go! [Terry] Go! Well, I'm just a hired gun, but I still don't understand why Interpol thinks Harry knows Mr. Big. Why do they think he is lieutenant? Just looks like a glorified errand boy to me. [Radio] Interpol to Norris. Come in please, emergency. Norris here. Please could you report the unauthorized take-off of a private jet, passengers aboard 8PM, two bodyguards and three foreign nationals belived to be military [Terry] Military? Yeah, there were some brass hats back at Adriana's You have a destination? [radio] Course setting plus fuel capacity indicates JFK, NY. Bind the name of the charter, here give me that. [Cromwell] What was the name of the charter company? [radio] Aircraft privately owned by General Saboutu Cuison Cuison? Cuison is part of the Philippines fallout. Word has it that he is now only a terrorist. He wants to be a dictator. [radio] You read me? We read you loud and clear. [radio] Who is this? Georges Norris, over and out. Thanks George [Cromwell] So, tell me George, why are we still chasing after Angelica? When we now Harry is on its way to New York. [Terry] Yeah.

Alone at last That's right Come here What? How much do you trust me? On a scale of one to ten or might as well be 5. Our new CEO get -10 You got good instincts Major. A little earlier I had the opportunity to pick Norris' pocket [Terry] What is it? Its'a a scrambler device, marked with chip circuit. You place it on a telephone, it messes up the message. The person on the other side has a matching unit, unscrambler Well he is a government agent. I mean, how do you know it isn't part of his spy kit Slight problem with that theory.
