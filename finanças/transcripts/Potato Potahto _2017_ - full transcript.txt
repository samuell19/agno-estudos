After careful deliberation, this is my final ruling. As per your prenuptial agreement, you both get to keep whatever you owned before your union. As for the house which you contributed equal funds and time, I grant you your request. Share the space equally if you are unwilling to sell. Good luck.

I thought I made myself clear on that. Lu, this is insane. How can you live in the same house with your ex-husband? I own half of that house, and I won't give him the satisfaction of taking it. I won’t let him win. Nobody wins in a divorce. Well, it’s where I live now. You either come and see me, or I'll come when I can. OK. I’ll see you later. OK, bye. [chuckles] [exhales deeply] So? It's official. [chuckles] [sighs] I now have focus and direction. Meaning you are moving out? [scoffs] My friend, I said direction, not ejection. I’m thinking of redecorating, actually. Maybe some red walls, a ping pong table... How about a housewarming party? [chuckles] Tell me. Why were you trying to get divorced again? Tony, just sell her the house now. I made the first offer to buy that house, you know that? She came back with a counteroffer and had the nerve to quote a lower price. [scoffs] I love that house. I made that house. It’s my dream home. You mean yours and hers. Yeah, so we'll both have it. After all, what else did she give me apart from heartaches? So you are punishing her for... ending a relationship you didn’t exactly fight for. Look, I fought for that relationship right from the first time I kissed her, and she said I tasted like herrings. [laughs] -Herrings. -Yes. -You taste like herrings? -Are you crazy?

You know I don’t like doing that before brushing my teeth in the morning. Yeah, clearly, you don't do a lot of things, Miss Perfect. What’s that supposed to mean? What kind of female are you? Most women would love to be kissed, cuddled, made love to in the morning-- I am not most women. Well, clearly... You didn’t seem to have a problem with that. Yeah, well I do now... I have a problem with not being able to kiss my wife after we wake, not being able to cuddle her because her neck will hurt, not being able to make love to her right after her menses because she’s raw, not being able to get into the shower with her because she will itch... Hell, I have a problem with marrying the least of all women. I decided to prepare you something. Aw. You didn’t have to. [chuckles] Thank you. How are you? Managing.

And you are supposed to be my boy? Now, if I was dragged to court to testify against you being a very terrible ex-husband, would you want me to testify truthfully or falsely? Uh, truthfully. Good. So the less I see of you here, the better for you, my friend. I guess you have a point but wait... Are you saying that I am a terrible husband? Your Honor, I guess he meant ex-husband. Son of a bitch. Beer? Sure. [sighs] How are you? I’m great. Hm. Where is she? So this is officially your space? [chuckles softly] Yeah.

I get to keep the house, and you... get a life. How's that? Look, I have a life, OK? And it’s not out here. Open this door, damn it! Jesus... All right. OK, I'm sorry but... I wasn’t going to move her in without telling you first. Really? Just like you told me about your new job on the day of your appointment? Or when you decided to have dinner with your ex-girlfriend and only told me when I walked in on you? Oh, wait. Here's a very good one.

[scoffs] You saw us? -Yes, I did. -[scoffs] About two days before the diamond ring arrived, I saw you guys having dinner at Labadi Beach Hotel. Now that stupid ring was... was a way to compensate for whatever you did that night with her. I am not some stupid girl that gets appeased with diamonds. -[Tony] Oh, really? -[Lulu] Yes. [scoffs] I had dinner with Thelma that night because she had waited all day to pick up your ring from the manufacturers. She had to be with her family, but I kept her there so I could pick it up. And so when it came at 9:30, the least I could do was to buy dinner for her as a way of saying thank you for your ring. [Marian sighs] [Gabby giggles] [grunts] So, where is the diamond ring? God, Gabby. Gabby, did you not hear them? He said he's returned it! Yeah, so let’s go and pick it up. [patronizingly] Oh, of course we can go and pick it up, Gabby. You know what? I have an idea. Why don’t we call Thelma and ask her to come to the shop and open it for us, hm? Really? [sighs] OK, uh... so there’s no diamond. What about gold? Guys, I am not picky. Help me out here. Anything? Oh! Tony, darling, why don’t you give them your gold watch and put us out of this misery? Where is the watch your wife bought you? I am beginning to lose my patience. I gave it away. You gave the watch away? I gave it to Cecil. Oh! You gave it to your brother? Wow, now I feel so much better. Oh, don’t play that guilt card with me, Lulu. You always knew I didn’t like yellow gold. I said this much when we had dinner with Fred and Bertha on their wedding anniversary. Five weeks later, you buy me a yellow gold watch as a birthday gift? My God, it was a $5,000 TAG Heuer watch. It was yellow gold. You never listen... just this... little voices in your head. Wait-- Wait a minute... -[laughs] -OK, so what’s funny? [Lulu] I wasn’t even there. That night at dinner, I had a phone call, and I excused myself for a while. I was gone for a very long time. When I came back, I asked you guys what I had missed, and Fred said you were talking about some precious minerals. You made a joke, and we laughed. You punish me for trying? I wasn’t even there, and guess who doesn’t remember? Because all you think about is the fact that Lulu is insensitive, Lulu doesn’t care... You never really gave me a chance, Tony. Don’t cry. He doesn’t deserve you. What was that? I said he doesn’t deserve her. Shut up, Gabby. It’s not like she’s perfect. Yeah. What kind of man gives away a $5,000 watch just because he doesn’t like the color yellow? And what kind of woman gives back a... A 10,000... 10,000 diamond ring just because she thinks her husband is cheating on her? Who does that? If you had asked me, I think they deserve each other. OK, we are going to search ourselves. Hm? Yeah. So you take his room, Tony, and I’ll take Lulu’s. Why do I get Tony’s room? Because you are a man, and you know where men hide stuff. You know where to look. I don’t want any cuff links or any ties. I really want good valuable stuff, OK? -OK? -Yeah. Good. Go on. Lulu, my mobile phone is in my pocket. Just come closer so you can try and reach it in my back pocket. Uh. I don’t know, Tony... Are you saying we should stay here till they come back? I don’t think they will harm us. And when they come back with nothing? They’ll find something... My wedding ring. I didn’t know you still had that. Look, Lulu... I am sorry... for the wristwatch, for... for everything. [sighs] I know we are better people than this. And I-- And I think so because we agreed to get married. I just-- I just think that we-- [distant gunshot] [Marian] What was that? [Gabby screams] -[groaning] I think I shot my ass. -What! [lighthearted music playing] Oh my God! -Is it really bad? -This is not good. I can feel my legs giving way. I am going to be a cripple. -Oh, sorry, sorry... what happened? -[groans] I sat on the gun. [groans] -Where is the gun? -[Gabby grunts] [Marian] OK, I'm gonna go get it. What? And abandon me? Here? Really? OK, you know what? Just let me do this. -[groans in pain] -Just hold it there. -[whimpers] -You need to get to the hospital as soon as possible. Does anyone know how to take a bullet out of an ass? Look, I need to get to a hospital right now. No, Gabby. This gun is not registered. They're going to call the police. [whimpers] I am going to die. Stop crying! I am trying to think! I have a doctor friend who can take care of this. On one condition... You untie us, you leave this place and never come back. Done... Done. Deal. Untie them! No. No? No! What if they attack us or call the police? Marian... We want this ordeal to be over as much he does. As long as you stay away, we have a deal. I swear on every advice that my mother gave me on women, I will shoot you where you stand if you don’t untie them right now! [groans] God, Gabby. You are such an ass. You are such an ass! I don’t have an ass. I need a hospital! What did you tell my wife? What? My ex-wife... you said something to her on the day I found you in bed with him. You spoke to her on your way out. What did you tell her? Nothing. What do you mean nothing? Exactly that. Nothing. -[scoffs] -Why? What did she say I told her? I just didn’t say anything. -Oh, how conveniently, Lulu. -[melancholic music playing] And yet you acted like I committed the most hideous of crimes? -Well, I thought you-- -[shouts] You thought what? I will not talk to you like this. Oh, you will talk to me right now. You don’t get to pull an act like that, shed some fake tears in front of your mother, act hurt, and then just not want to talk about it. Well, I thought you instigated it. You thought I instiga... Oh... [chuckles] You thought I got Marian to sleep with your boyfriend? He’s not my boyfriend. No. What can I say? You two kissed. He kissed me! And I’m sure there was a lot of encouragement with that. No! You do not get to slap me. Look, those two would have found themselves as they should have. But for you to accuse me of instigating so... I can’t-- You brought her into our house, Tony. And it got your attention, didn’t it? So that's it? All you wanted was my attention? Yes, damn it. I wanted your attention. I wanted it. We have been married for two years, but you treat me like I am a stranger in my own house. Oh, please, don’t you dare accuse me of raising barriers. You wouldn't even look at me when I came down to say hi to Fred. Yeah, well, you were on your way out to go be eaten by some maniac-- I am not going to let you go.

Mum, it won’t change anything. -Lulu... -Mum. He said he loved me before we got married. He loved me whilst we were married, and he still loves me even after the divorce. What difference would that make? It doesn’t change who we are, what we want, and how we got here in the first place. You haven’t learned anything. I have. Oh, I have. I've learned that Tony is a selfish, egotistic, competitive man who would never change. I'm sure he has a tall list for me too. And yet he still says he loves you. Do you know how difficult that must be for him? Mum, why are you telling me all this now? Because nobody is perfect. That's the lesson I hoped you would have learned. [scoffs] I have been married to your father for 33 years and some. And the only thing that stops me ramming his teeth down his throat every time he snores loudly beside me... is-- is that lesson. None of us is perfect. And that's what makes the ride fun. [sighs] Do you still love him? That makes it easier then. Nobody is born wise. Figure something out... please. Where is he now? He's at the house. The agent said he hasn’t moved out yet. Maybe we should put the decorating on hold for a few more days whilst you get creative. -[laughs] -[chuckles] [sighs] Let me get you something to drink. Um... More reds than whites.

Oh... yeah... hm... the usual Tony type. Tall, slim, you know, pageant-looking almost. I see. I am still confused as to why he married you. Well, hopefully this divorce is gonna help the confusion.

Come on, man. You are not the worst couple in the world, trust me. Says the happily married man. I had an affair. Yeah. Surprise, surprise. Wait, what? When? Why? How? Last Christmas... we met at the mall. She had too much to carry, and I offered to help her to her car. And? We exchanged numbers and... started spending time together. She didn’t have a boyfriend? Married... -three kids. -[groans] She was the most exciting woman I had ever met. Son of a... So, what? She was bored? You were unhappy? I didn’t even know I was unhappy until she came along. Suddenly, I didn’t look forward to coming home anymore. And Bertha didn’t even know how gone I was. The thing is... we had gotten used to each other, so used to each other. We... We didn’t argue, we didn’t fight, we just... got along... Yeah, and it made me angry. Really angry. [scoffs] Wait... You were angry because you weren't fighting? I was angry because there was no reaction. I just wanted some form of reaction, some attention, her attention, any attention. And... I came home one day and blurted it out. I was having an affair. [sighs] She cried... too much. I knew I had hurt her. I ended it... six months after it started. The affair was done, but I got my reaction. But you know what? Till today, that's the only source of our argument, and I am grateful for it. Yeah. Listen, I am not proud of what I did, but it woke my marriage up. It was dying, man. One day, I would have just upped and left. [sighs] So why didn’t you tell me about the affair? I didn’t want to give you the wrong reason to leave. And now you think I have the right reasons? You guys argued to the very end though, and I think you gave it your best shot. I sure did, and up to the point that I told her that I still loved her. -You what? -[sentimental music playing] Yeah, I told you that-- No, wait. You told her you still loved her? And what did she say? Don’t answer. She still moved out. -[scoffs] -[laughs] [laughs] [clears throat] So... this is me. OK. So... you're sure I can’t come in? Well, I have an early morning tomorrow.

Lulu, right? -Yes, ma’am. [laughs] I was at your wedding. Yes, you were! -Yes. -[both laugh] How is your handsome husband? He is great. Everyone is fine. Any children yet? No, not yet. But sometime soon. -You know how these modern couples are. -Yes. Anyway, it’s been good seeing you again. -I should be leaving now. Thank you. -OK. Mum, say something. I’m sorry. I had no idea you were seeing anybody. I mean, you only moved out a couple of weeks ago. It’s Tony’s. Sorry? We... we slept together... -twice... after the divorce. -[melancholic music playing] [clears throat] I... I-- I don’t know what to say. Perhaps you should say I messed up this time. It’s your child too, Lulu. And it's not such a bad thing. Really? Tony has already moved on, and I'm going to become his baby mama? I don’t think so. I'm getting rid of it. Are you crazy? And at your age? I don’t care how you want to spin this. You are not getting rid of anything! Plus, he has a right to know. He is the father after all. Please! On which planet does Tony deserve to know anything? He’s already dating. If I remember rightly, you moved out. So what? I'm easily replaceable? We don’t always get what we want, and right now, I really don’t think you know what that is. Well, I know I don’t want a child right now. Why did you really come here, Lu?
