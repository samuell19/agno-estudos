In 1943, the most dramatic year of World War II, big battles are constantly unrolling on all the fronts. The Red Army is quickly advancing towards the west. General Rommel is swiftly retreating on the African front before the allied forces. The doors are opening wide open for the invasion into Hitler's European stronghold. On the Balkan battlefield, after the fiasco of the forth Fascist offensive, the initiative is passing over to Tito's partisans. The national liberation army of Yugoslavia headed by the supreme command and Tito is creating a new, liberated territory. Convinced that the allies would land right on the Balkans, Hitler orders his two generals von Löhr and Lüters a new offensive against the partisan forces. Because of the critical conditions on the fronts and to prepare the forces for future battles in the Balkan and in Europe, it is necessary at any cost to deal a lethal blow to the Yugoslav partisans and once and for all eliminate the dangerous Balkan battlefield. Therefor we must immediately surround and destroy the partisan combat units and their leader Tito. The Party is Hitler and Hitler is Germany. And based on the number of people and military equipment involved the biggest operation called >>SCHWARZ This movie is about it. SUTJESKA Starring Directed by How are you Rado? Good, good. On Neretva with two legs, here with one. Nurse Vera took care of the other one. She chose a nice place. She buried it on the top of a hill. But you can fight even with only one leg. Even without both of them. If a human soul exists it's not just in the heart and in the head. It's poured all over the body, isn't it? Part of my soul remained in that amputated leg. Yes, yes. I want to have a graveyard for the legs, a special one for the hands and another one for the fists. He lost a lot of blood. Part of my soul - in this blood. In this bandage... In all these bandages. Does it hurt? It will hurt much more when we set out on our way. Let's leave this place, comrade Tito. They are here, somewhere close. I can smell their stench. They smell like corpses even when they are alive. An operation without anaesthesia. When this bloody war ends, you will all be sent to school. Like your late mother always wanted. So she sees you all as engineers and scholars. There were four of you. Ah well, Nino fell in battle. When the battle starts don't boast. Save your lives! And don't be the last as well. Don't cause us problems. Any news? -Yes. -Tell! The information from Croatia and Bosnia tells us that large German units are coming upon us. But they say that such information is unreliable and unverified. We'll see. Maybe the Germans are preparing a minor offensive. Moscow demands that we decide about dissolving the Comintern. Message for Moscow. Notice for the Comintern. The central committee of the Yugoslav communist party is in total agreement with the proposal of the Comintern dissolvement. The Communist party of Yugoslavia still supports the ideas of internationalism. Signed by, secretary-general, Tito. I tried to get you on the phone. What was it? In the sector of division there are German movements. -How many? According to unverified information, another German division is headed towards us. Hello, Djuro. -Hi! Take some rest. I have totally gave up on sleeping in a bed. Alright, don't worry. I will wake you up. Comrade Tito. The rear is informing us, that the movements of the German and Italian forces are getting bigger and bigger. The Germans keep on coming. Our reconnaissances have detected large movements of Italians and Bulgarian units. There is no doubt that there are big troop movements prepared. Therefor we must abandon our plan to breakthrough into Serbia and Macedonia. Because of the wounded. We must return. Back to Bosnia. We must retreat with all of our forces and wounded. I think we should leave immediately. -We can't. We are expecting the arrival of a British military expedition. But the waiting is only worsening the situation -We have to wait. Because they are already on their way? Their arrival is politically very important. But the Germans are coming in big numbers. Ok. Let the British come here and see for themselves. Let them see the truth and the real conditions in Yugoslavia. Let them all see that blood has been shed in the last two years. Blood, spilt for the freedom of all of our nations. Comrade, doctor Vera has arrived. Let her in. Yes, comrade commander-in-chief. Vera, a very big offensive is in preparation. The wounded have to be prepared immediately for departure. Bathe the wounded, take off their bandages and wash them. When you will be changing their bandages, store one half for reserve. But there are also such wounds that we cant take off the bandages. It's easier for them to bare it if they don't see it. -Vera, don't worry. It two years they have seen a lot of blood. They won't be scared. Take off their bandages. I'm afraid that not all of them will allow that. Let's not argue. Execute an order and they will agree to it. What if they don't? -Vera, do it. Yes, comrade commander-in-chief. It's like it never was washed. There is blood here from 1941. Zoran! What is it? -Where are you going? What do you care? -Nothing, just asking! From what unit are you? -From second proletarian. Are the Germans below? -You can't see them, but you can hear them! Do you remember weeks ago, when we crossed Neretva? When the situation was the most tense, I thought of killing you. First you, then myself. The next time when something like that pops into your head, you kill yourself and I'll manage myself. And I won't hang out with you anymore. I'll demand to be transferred to another unit. Shut up you stupid yokel. -I've had enough of you now! If you scold me one more time, I'll report you to the commissar, and you'll get what you deserve, just so you know! -Shut up! Boro, my son! Boro, let me go! It is urgent that you return to your villages and inform the people, that they should hide with their cattle in the hills. And all you board members must stay with them all the time. Till when will it be this way, Nikola? We spend more time in caves then at home. Our cattle will die and our land will disintegrate. It doesn't cultivate. The children are like wolves, roaming in the woods. It will be this way Mile, until the war ends. Until we win. You can see what the enemy is like. They don't care if it's a partisan, villager or child. They kill anyone they find. -Nikola, the Germans! Is this your house? I don't understand. -Where is your family? What are you doing here alone? I don't understand! Search everywhere. General Lüters. -Yes. Is the circle formed? -Yes, completely. The partisans have no chance. -Good. 108th hunting division. 369th legionary division. Italian alpine division Taurinesse. The units of general Ludwiger. Below there is the Bulgarian regiment. Italian Venezia division. 1st Mountain division. Italian Ferrara division. Diversion regiment Brandenburg. And behind there the SS division Prince Eugen. How many soldiers do you have on the battlefield, general? Around 120.000. -And how many partisans are there? According to our estimates around 20.000 and a few thousand wounded. So it is. 6 to 1. Cveto, we'll give you some arms. -Nikola, I'll take some rest. Take this there! Where have you been, staff has been waiting for us. Do you remember Nikola, when we were in Vucevo last year how many wild berries there were. -It will be the same this year. It will be full of Germans this year. Take two battalions and hold back the peak at any cost. As long as Vucevo is in our hands, we have the advantage. Yes, comrade commander-in-chief! Go now and hurry. As long as we hold out, we'll be safe. Hi, Nikola. Move! 1st proletarian, move. Come on comrades, hurry up. Nikola, wait. Stop, will you. You don't care, do you? You wanted to leave me. Did you hear the story about the sharks? -I already heard it. You didn't hear this one. I told you the one about the Chinese woman. Comrade, don't leave. -I'm here, Dino. To touch the face. Your wife is a real beauty. It's good that we're together again. -I have to leave for Vucevo. Bring me berries, lots of berries. Doctor Vera. -Vera. I will bring you a bunch of flowers. Doctor Vera! Bring me berries, lots of berries. Listen! Wait, let's head slowly towards Vucevo. Step by step. So people light up a cigarette, ok. Gentlemen, the circle around the partisans is formed. We must destroy them without mercy. Disregard the population. Burn down the villages and destroy anything that breathes. -But general. What about the women and children? I've clearly said everything, colonel. Anything that breathes. This time the Fuehrer must get the kind of report, that he expects from me. Jure! Rado, Rado! -Don't fear, Dusko, don't fear! Is their a lot of airplanes, Rado? Is there a lot of them? Vucevo. It seems that this mountain could be of great importance. Colonel Wagner, immediately conquer Vucevo. Yes, Mr. general! Pity that you didn't think about this already before. Come on girl, pull. -Don't hurt my horse. She saved my life twice. -She just has to bring this cannon to the top, and I'll kiss her on her ass. You just do. Then she'll be able to carry this heap of iron of yours. Come on, damn it. Look at him. He's climbing like a goat not like a human. Danilo, Danilo! Where are we? Where are we? -In the dark. Captain Stewart. Do you think that the partisans are still waiting for us? We can be glad if we won't be greeted by the Germans. Mr Churchill will prepare for us a wonderful reception. Especially for you, a close friend. -Yes. How do you think Tito looks like? I bet he has a moustache. Just like Stalin. Huso, look. We are the British officers. Welcome gentlemen. Tito is expecting you. Comrade Tito, the British military expedition has arrived. Captain Stewart, do you understand? Do you speak our language? -Yes sir, but not so good. May I introduce to you captain Dicken, guides Throten and Roys. -Let's go inside. -Thank you. Sit down, gentlemen. -Thank you, sir. We bring you greetings from our government and president Winston Churchill. -Thank you. You are the first military expedition that has stepped on our ground. We are also expecting the Russians soon. We have waited for you for a long time. Well, we're here now. I hope it's easier for you now that the second front has been opened. -We have opened the second front already, captain We have opened it in 1941. -We have been informed about the numerous casualties, that you have in this war. Indeed, there was a lot of casualties. And there will be many more. The war will not end in a week or month or year. It will probably last for several years. We will fight to the last drop of blood, if you open the second front or not. I hope you will realise that yourself too. Where is the front? -It's where the Germans are. And where are the Germans? -Everywhere. Gentlemen, I think we'll have to leave. It has become too dangerous here. The Germans have completely surrounded us. Will you be able to break through? The Germans most surely hope that we wont be able to do that. But we have been surrounded in the past too. Actually the whole Europe is surrounded. We have already managed to break through once and we'll do it again. Our arrival is the confirmation of your battle. I hope we will preserve our friendship. I mean among the nations. Not just during the war, but also after it, when you will defeat Nazi Germany. -Of course, sir. This silence is tiring. Even the birds don't sing anymore, Sime. They even killed the song. Ivan, how's your hand? -It's ok. Get up. -Where are we going? -To the headquarters. You should come too. We must return you to your father. Come on, stand up. Come on. You see, Nikola. We accomplished our duty in a jiffy. Sime, break through to the headquarters. Nikola, you as well. For Moscow! Message for the Free Yugoslavia radio station. Notify the units of the national liberation army of Yugoslavia, that the Germans have started even a bigger offensive against the headquarters and the divisions around it as last year. I order... Radio Moscow for Free Yugoslavia. We are carrying the order of commander-in-chief Tito. Translate what they're saying! The Germans have started against the headquarters and the divisions around it even a bigger offensive then previous winters. I order: The accelerated demolishment of bridges, roads, railway tracks, military objects, warehouses and factories. Destroy the enemy's war fighting capability. Tito. Now you know in what kind position you are in. But you have noticed it a bit late. Where is Sime? What should i tell you? Was the kid in pain? -No. Did you at least find him a meter of soil? -We did. What happened to Sime? Go wash your face. Comrades! The Germans are closing their circle. We have to... Radoslav, sit down. You're wet. We have to break through. At the same time we have to save our wounded. The plan is as follows. We will divide into two groups. The first and second proletarian division, ten brigades from the northern group. The headquarters will go with them. We will cross Sutjeska at Bar and Kosurje. Then we cross Zelengor. It will be difficult, but we have no other option. The third shock division and the seventh Banij division, six brigades, form the southern group. You will break through across Tara into Sandzak. Radoslav, you will command the group. Sava Kovacevic will command the third division. The central hospital will also go with your group. We have to save the wounded. -I understand, comrade Tito. It's raining heavily. -Yes. Shall I order the departure? -No. Can I make a suggestion? -No. If we can't go out because of the weather neither can they. Why are you so loud with the smashing. Are you crazy? You'll wake up my army! There is no peace anywhere. Who is it? Courier from the headquarters. I'm looking for comrade Sava Kovacevic. Come in. What is it? -Here you go, it's all written here. Eat something and then leave. -I understand! -Help yourself. Where are the wounded? -They set off with Sava towards Tara. And where are we going? -Towards Sutjeska. Nikola, who are these people? -The British military expedition. I thought that we had help, cannons and food coming. These are only four people. I'll talk to them a bit. Well go on, if you understand English. English expedition? Yes, expedition. You not like rain, do you? Yes, you like Yugoslav people. Yes. -Do you have a cigarette? Thank you. -Take one for your friend as well. Thank you. Take one, colleague. Shame on you for begging. -I didn't beg, I asked him, like a person asks another person. He has, I don't, so we share. You're not in a sailor's tavern. Departure, comrades, departure. -Let's go. Come on, hurry up, we're leaving! -How am I happy to hear this word, leaving! Do we have any other order in this army of ours? Departure, comrades. Departure! Sava is here. Hi, Sava. -Hi. I've brought you 4.000 wounded. Are any of them in good health? They're all on stretchers, hardly moving. Come on, we're leaving! Departure! Departure, comrades. Where are we going? -We'll follow Sava, towards Tara. How long will we carry ourselves around? -Until the war ends. How will it end if the boys don't believe in God. They all believe. -They don't pray. If they prayed, this war would have already ended. Even the Germans pray. -We have to. I have prayed for my wounded husband day and night. Did he recover? -No, he died. He fooled me. While I was praying, he had Stalin's picture under his pillow. How could he recover. If they don't pray, what do they believe in? In their selves, in all of us. Mr. general. The reconnaissance in Sutjeska has spotted an opening in the circle, approximately 5 kms wide. But I have ordered you to completely form the circle. Instead of that you allowed us to lose Vucevo. I think it is clear gentlemen how important this mountain is. Colonel Wagner. Send your units immediately to Sutjeska, did you understand? Yes, Mr general. Gentlemen! Once and for all I order you to prevent the partisans from breaking through at any price. Poison the water kill the wounded, in short, kill anything that moves. Did you understand? Yes, Mr general. Are the Germans in front of us? Is the circle ahead of us? What are you doing Rado! I'm fixing the crutch. We will have to be fast when we will be breaking through. Where is Sava? He's here, on his position. Then everything is fine if he's here. They're attacking, take your positions! Over here! Quickly, quickly. Hill. We'll have to try somewhere else. Let's go! The southern group can't cross Tara. The wounded are with them. Thousands and thousands of them. They'll have to return. We'll have to wait until they reach Sutjeska. The commander of the first division is informing us that we have to follow them without delay towards Zelengora. Our units in Kosura and Baranje are cut in two. They can't hold out for much longer. I know, I know. There are thousands of wounded partisans with us. We'll wait. Colonel Wagner! I'm angry. What you have done is intolerable. First you lose Vucevo, then you let these bandits, divert towards Sutjeska. We're doing everything that is in our power. Mr general, we have conquered the peak of Maglica, but the partisans are fighting like wolves. Well done, colonel. It is wonderful how you admire the communists. I am warning you for the last time. If you don't immediately break their resistance, I will discharge you from your position. Mr general, they're constantly attacking. Ineffective! With all forces! We have to hold out, the wounded are behind us. Look how many of them there are. There's as many of them as the Chinese. Forward, attack! Comrade Nikola, they're calling you over to the second Dalmatian staff. Sign it, the second Dalmatian staff. Message for Tito. -You want me to take it? I trust you the assignment. And hurry up. The courier from Bar has just arrived comrade Tito. Comrade commander-in-chief. The Dalmatians are informing us. The Germans are penetrating further and each time with greater force. We have lost 2/3 of our men, but you can count on us, as though we are in full strength. What are these messages? Reports from various areas. All in the midst of fierce battles. What are you writing, professor? History. -I hope we'll survive it. Only history survives for sure. Nikola. I have handed over the message to Tito. Forward, forward! Damn dogs. Dusko, Dusko! Look out, look out! Lie down, Dusko! Damn devils! Ivo! Ivo! What happened? Ivo don't.. don't scare me, Ivo. Dad, dad! Dad! Dad, Ivo is dying. Jure. Wait here! My Ivo. Dad, are you crying? I'm not crying son. It's the rain. It's raining. You know, dad. I was always proud of you because you never cried. Not when Nino left. and neither when Sime fell. And look, now I'm sorry, because these aren't your tears. Listen, take ten fighters and bury the son. We will bury Ivo along with Jure. It's ok, Sava. Departure comrades, let's go! Bury the dead. Let's go, Dusko, I'll lead you. We lost contact with Sava's division. Keep calling them without interruption. The commander of the first division is informing us that we have to follow them immediately. The commander of the second division is informing us that he's hardly Kosur any more. Commander! You'll be happy to hear the news that I just got from general Alexander. -Happy, of course. It says: Greetings and best wishes in these critical moments of your fight against the invader of your country. The dreams of the invasion on Europe are not only dreams any more. On the east the Germans have been punished by our Russian allies. That's why your battle in the forthcoming month is more important then ever. Isn't it stimulating, sir. -Of course. Would you be so kind, captain and inform general Alexander that we appreciate his best wishes, but that in these moments we would need less encouragement and more combat airplanes. Yes, sir. I'm sure, that the general will do everything in his power. The fact is, sir that we didn't think you could hold out so many German divisions. It's really incredible. It's really encouraging that you finally realised it yourself too. You're doing well, sir. Your pulse is getting weaker, Mr colonel. Why such silence, Mr major? The bandits have dispersed on all sides, Mr colonel. I don't want to die in such silence. I'm afraid of this silence. What shall we do, Mr. colonel? Fire, fire with all cannons. Break this silence. Fire! Into shelter! There is no ceasefire, not even for a moment. Don't fear colleague, I have not forgotten about you. Poor man, I don't even know your name. The headquarters from Croatia and Slovenia are informing us, that your order of attacking transport objects is being executed to full extent. Good. Transmit this order: Bury the heavy weaponry and documents. Kill the horses for food and immediately. Come my friend, help me dismantle this cannon. -No! I don't want to be later killed because of your stupidity. Aren't we comrades, friends, communists? Come on, we are colleagues, aren't we? It's true we're a bit of everything, but that doesn't mean anything. Tito ordered to bury the cannons period. And what now? -We'll return. Where will we return? -Back. If I don't lose my head with you I don't know with whom I can. Don't worry. Now we're a special unit. Stuff your special unit somewhere! Let's go, Rado! You just hold on to me. This cannon might save our lives. Aim! Fire! Comrade commander! We have lost contact with the column. Fine, we'll break through alone, until we catch up with them. Set up the sentry. We'll wait here till the morning. May I ask you something, sir? Did we get lost? Could you get lost in your country captain? For the generals: Nigholdt, Lötz, Kübler, Stadtner and Ludwiger. The enemy is trying to break through our lines with all of its force through Sutjeska and Zelengora into Bosnia. I order: Enemy's breakthrough has to be stopped with all forces for any price. I repeat: with all forces for any price. And second. The circle has to be formed tighter, we have to find the enemy in Sutjeska, get him together and destroy him without mercy. Over! Comrade! Is this the forth Montenegro brigade? -Yes. Are you the commander? -Yes! Our column broke up last night. Conquer Ljubin grob and defend it for 24 hours. -Yes. This is very important. We have to removed the wounded across Ljubin grob in Kosuta. -I understand, comrade Tito. I managed to get contact with London, sir. Excellent. -Actually it's not. The RAF is pretty busy. To tell you the truth, there is too few of them, to come over here. I'm sorry. Maybe it's better this way. -Excuse me? When the war ends, we won't owe anyone anything. We will earn our freedom completely on our own behalf, that is, if we even gain the freedom. Comrades, attack! Stewart, Stewart! Notify London... Jure. Is anyone still alive? Commander, commander, what happened? Defend Ljubin grob for 24 hours... You're wounded. Does it hurt? I didn't know, that a person can have... ... so much blood after 14 days of starving. Give her an injection. -Nina, he's wounded. Bandage his hand. -Nina, give her the injection. I don't need it. Save it for someone, that will need it more. I told you, to give her the injection. Help the wounded. Inform the command about captain Stewart's death. Isn't any further battle meaningless, sir? If I ever wanted to order my army to surrender, I would have to be hold responsible before my people like any other and I would be found guilty of high treason. But you are the commander-in-chief, sir. I have no right to order people, that they shouldn't' fight for their freedom. Ok, I'll inform London. And not just about Stewart's death. -Ok. Courier. Take this message to Tito. The commander of the first division is informing us, that they've come across a new enemy circle and that they're going into breakthrough towards Malinovac. Immediately strengthen Ljubin grob in Kosuta. We don't have enough fighters. And all the wounded, that can move, all already on their positions. We have to hold back Ljubin grob and Kosuta, for any price. We'll work our way through in this part. Comrade commander-in-chief! Message from Ljubin grob. I destroyed the message, because I was afraid that the Germans would catch me. The message is as follows: As long as you hear shooting from Ljubin grob the Germans will not come through. When there is no shooting any more it will mean that there isn't a single communist left in Ljubin grob. Help him. While you were changing, our unit left. Come on, what's taking you so long? -I can't, my boots are pinching . Throw them away. -Have you ever seen a barefooted general? What are you? -A general! This isn't a general's uniform. It is, it is! Slow down, sit down. Let's light up a cigarette. Here Nikola, light it up. -Thank you. Thank you, Mr general. -Please, you unfortunate partisan! Can they all dress up as nice as I can? In these two years that I'm among the partisans I have changed more uniforms, then I would normally in ten lives. And you know what I like about it, Nikola? I can degrade myself or elevate myself all on my own. If I want to be a solider, I'm a soldier. If I want to be a general, there, a general. What is it Nikola, what's bothering you? Right now I would really like to jump in the ocean, swim under water, to wash all this blood from myself, the fear and the horror. It's easy for you, Nikola. You will clean yourself with your beauty. What should I do, should i go sail with a boat? Let's go. Let's pick a bunch of flowers for Vera. I promised her, she'll be happy. Ivan. What would... You're fine! The flowers have ruined me. I always said, that flowers aren't for a man. First bunch of flowers in my life, and look... Nikola, don't tell Vera, how afraid I was. You'll give her the flowers yourself. I'll carry you. That isn't possible, my friend. This hole can't be mended. Let's go. You will still see Chinese women. You will still hunt sharks. I will leave everything behind me, even the books. And like two vagabonds we will sail with the boat around. From port to port, from tavern to tavern, here and there. This isn't for your my friend. Libraries are for you. But first we will lock ourselves for a month in your tavern, and we will drink and sing. Tell Vera, that your Dalmatian man left you. Tell her that the Dalmatian is a villain, thief, liar. Yet still he was a good man... Wait! -What is it, Rado? What is this now, comrade Sava? Now here, now there again. Take this crutch. You'll need it. Now here, now there again... We have to break through, let's go. Listen, mom. Come back. You saw me. Give me a kiss. -No, I'll stay. Where could you go with me. Don't you see there's a war going on? That's why I'm staying. You can even die. That's exactly why I'm staying here. -Come on, if i tell you. And enough about that I would die. There go our archives and all of the documentation. -Doesn't matter. All of your suffering and hope is written there. Let it tell now those horrible stories. Have you seen my son by any chance? Have you seen my Boro? Boro. Leave it, comrade priest. With this, priest, pray for my soul, tomorrow, when you will be breaking through the circle. I will find more consolation in that. Comrade commander-in-chief. Ljubin grob and Kosuta are barely holding back. They are informing us, that the breakthrough shouldn't be delayed not even for a moment. The situation is very serious. The commander of the second division suggests, that we immediately head towards them. -Yes. Yes, I know. As the party secretary and as the commander-in-chief, as a human, I cannot accept such a decision. We have to wait. We have to wait. We have to wait for our wounded comrades. Comrade. The seventh Banije division with 600 lightly wounded has arrived. Do you maybe know where Sava is? -I don't know. We separated three days ago, and I went first across Piva. Sava stayed with the heavily wounded. Ok. Here, eat. I picked this for us. Dusko. Zoran, where is Rado? He'll come. I'm going, Ljubica. Where are you going? -To the forest. So I wont be a nuisance to anyone. Has it come that far? -Yes, that far. Nikola. Go to Vera, she's wounded. Stay with her. Nikola. Wash your face, so she won't see you like this, will you? Nikola. Everything will be fine, Nikola. It will be, just this circle... The Dalmatian is sending you this. He left. He went sailing. Nikola. Vera is weak. We have to cut off the hand immediately. It will be hard. We have no anaesthesia. Bring Vera. It's over, Nikola. You have a brave wife. She bared all of this heroically. But she can't come with us tonight. We'll leave you ten fighters. Go see her. Don't, Nikola. Don't. Tell me. Tell me something beautiful. Tell me about our Jelena. Take care of her. Take care... God! In the name of the children, in the name of the wives, in the name of the helpless, in the name of the people. Open the door for them, let them go. They have to live. If you exist, be on our side. If you don't exist, we'll manage. Listen, you three. Leave the caps and guns and break through to the village. Wait for me there, I will come for you. Ljubica, accompany them and give them some bread, if there's any left. Go, heroes. All this has to be set in motion, commissar. And what will happen tomorrow? -What will be tomorrow? It all depends on what we do today. Listen, Barba. Take my horse and go with your son. Go, go Barba. Stop! Run, son, take the horse and run. Stop! Don't move! Have mercy on me! You have already killed three of my sons. Kill me, just spare my little boy. My Jure. Sime. My Ivo. My Nino. My Jure... Don't! Life will be a good enough punishment for him. My son. My Jure. My Ivo. Sime. Nino. Comrade Tito, there is still no contact with the third division. Keep on calling. Pick up these arms. -Water, water... Why are you crying? We're alone. What will happen to us? Water! Here you go, comrade. I'll send you some help. -Nobody can help us. The commander fell in action last night. That was the commander-in-chief, comrade. Who? Him, Tito? Then he will see his Banija after all. Call the commander. What can i do for you, comrade commander-in-chief. Why did you leave these people? Aren't they mind? -These are our wounded. Admit them and report to me later. I understand, comrade commander-in-chief. Comrades! We will start with the breakthrough. Our courage will not let us down. The destiny of the wounded is the destiny of the third division and it is my destiny. I expect a report after the breakthrough. Let's go, comrades. Attack! Do you hear, Boro, my prayer? Sava! Come on commissar, we have to pass by. This is the battle for our fallen comrades. This battle is for our people's revolution. All communists come forward. You never divided us, comrade Tito. Why now? We are all communists now, comrade Tito. For Generals Nigholdt, Lötz, Kübler, Ludwiger and Stadtner. The last part of the operation has begun. I want a graveyard down there. May Sutjeska become a mass graveyard for the communists. No one shall stay alive. Over! -I understand. Let's go. Attack! Be careful, that's the last! What if the forth one comes? -We'll be in trouble! Attack, Hercegovinians! Pera Markovic is reporting. With great losses the third division managed to break through. Commander Sava fell in battle. Of the 800. fighter, 195 of us are ready for battle. Attack! What surprising people. Bring the horse so we load it. What will you do with a cannon, if we don't have any ammunition?
