Hi, Carl. Hi, Jeremy. Give me a minute, I'll get your Racing Form for you. Okay, thanks. How you been? Okay, thanks. Well, handicapper, who do you like today? I don't know. There's this horse in the third race. yeah, here. I don't know if he's been scratched. No. No, here he goes. This horse, Summer Melody, is stepping way down in class. He's gonna romp home. you want me to put something on it for you? No, thanks. you know I don't bet. Forget it. Take it. Thanks. I'll see you. Take care, Jeremy. Some crazy kid. Comes in every day, always buys a Racing Form, always picks a winner, never bets. Jeremy, let me ask you something. I'm a little puzzled. How far do you want to get with this? I mean, how good do you really wanna get? I wanna be able to play pretty good. you know, you'll never be concert quality. you do know that, don't you? Why not? your energies are too divided. Great musicians saved all their energies for their work. I work hard at my music. you know that. Look, I'm not finding fault with you. I just think you're at a point in your studies where you ought to know where I think you now stand. Look, there's nothing wrong with being a good musician. You don't have to be great. Not everybody can be great. I'd like to be. Well, look... Perhaps I was a little harsh with you just now, but music is harsh. Art is harsh. Standards are high. And my standards for you and all my students are high, so... ...if I have to sacrifice a little warmth in the way I talk to you, you mustn't think that that's a lack of affection. Sure. I understand. Do you? I think so. I hope so. Sometimes I think it's a lot easier to be a friend than a teacher. Heads up. Good play, J. Good play. Heads up. It's my ball. All right. Good game. Man, you know Sonny can't go to his left. you gotta play him way over to his right so he can't pull that fade away jump shot crap. Shit, he never scored that way off me before. He's just having a good day. We should have beat those guys. Now let me see you do that thing with the ball. For a soda? you're on. Jeremy? Hi, Dad. What are you doing, son? Homework. How can you possibly work with that thing blaring in your ears? It's easy. What do you mean, easy? you can't do two things at the same time and do them both well. Dad, the music helps me to concentrate. Ridiculous. What do you think would happen if everyone in this world tried to do two things at the same time? Probably get a lot more things done. That's not funny, Jeremy. Son, be serious. We've been through this so many times. Look, everybody works. Everybody has a job. Myjob is advertising. your job is school. Look at me when I'm talking to you. I got where I am in my job by working hard and by concentrating. And you have to do the same. you have to concentrate, too. But, Dad, I get straight A's. Except for one B. That's beside the point. What are you reading? History. Well, music and history don't mix. How about music and English? How about English and English? Okay, Ben, I'll explain it to you again. The orange blossom and the Caribbean orange both sell for 15 cents a tile, including installation. The others sell for ten cents a tile, but installation is extra. On the other hand, Marty said this room cries for avocado. Who's Marty? He's Ruth's friend, the decorator. I didn't know we were using a decorator. Since when are we paying for a decorator? Ben, I can't get these tiles without a decorator. Now pick the one you like best, and then I'll tell you the one I like. Why don't you pick the orange one? Don't be a smart-ass. But, Dad, they all look the same to me. Well, I prefer the Caribbean orange. It's happier. Happier? Excuse me. It's happier than what? There's a pie in the icebox. What kind? Open the icebox and you'll find out. And watch out for my plants. It's this one, Ben. The boy's right. Damn things all look alike. To you, I suppose they do. Shit. Hey, Jeremy, what's my number? Hi, Ralph! 30... 12... Thanks. I always get it mixed up with my gym locker number. yeah, sure. Why don't you write the thing down? It's 30-12-34. It's simple. It's okay. I got a good memory. Meet me after first period. yeah, okay. Good morning, class. Good morning. If I could have your attention now for a few minutes. A concert has definitely been scheduled to take place in two weeks. Two weeks--not much time, but we'll be all right. Now... Diane and Sherry are scheduled to begin the program, so if we could have something from them to begin the class with. Very good. you've been working. It was good the first half. The second half we're gonna have to work on. We've got plenty of time to take care of that. Very good. Thank you. All right, and now let's have Jeremy. All right, are we ready? Take it. That's very nice, Jeremy. Did you hear that, class? Now, that cello piece is usually played as part of a quartet, with the slow passages counter pointed by staccato sixteenth notes in the violas. Here, let me show you on the blackboard. There's no chalk. Jeremy, would you please get me some chalk? Thank you. What we'll do instead while we're waiting for the chalk is carry on with our ensemble work, okay? What page would that be on? Excuse me. I'm gonna look in yours. Let's all move to-- I think we're up to page seven. And on your page it's what? Thirteen. Back to the beginning now... you scared me. Gee, I'm sorry. you really scared me. I'm sorry. What are you doing here? I don't know. I was walking by this door and I saw you dancing. That thing you were doing... That was a pli?, right? What makes you think that was a pli?? I don't now. It's the only dance word I know. No, it wasn't. What do you want? Is there any chalk in here? yeah, there's some over there. Oh, yeah. you'll have to excuse me. I gotta get this thing together. I'm being tested in a few minutes. Oh, yeah. Sure, go ahead. It was nice meeting you. yeah, sure. She's beautiful. Ralphie, she's beautiful. What are you talking about? Who's beautiful? There's this new girl at school, a dancer--I can't believe it. I was going past this room to get a piece of chalk, and there was this girl just dancing there. Wow, man, she's unreal. So what's her name? Oh, shit. What do you mean? you didn't get her name? Man, I really blew it. you sure did. How could you forget to ask her name? God, I blew it. How do you ask a girl her name? How do you ask her name? Exactly. That's simple. you just walk up to her and start a conversation with her... Cut it out, will you? Listen to the poem. ''She was a Phantom of delight When...'' Go on, will you? ''She was a Phantom of delight ''When first she gleamed upon my sight; ''A lovely Apparition, sent to be a moment's ornament; ''Her eyes as stars of Twilight fair; ''Like Twilight's, too, her dusky hair; ''But all things else about her drawn ''From May-time and the cheerful dawn... An image gay, To haunt, to startle.'' That's it for today. Tomorrow I'm considering a haiku poem, Obedience, which may or may not pertain to some of you. Come on, let's go. That was a nice surprise, you picking me up from school today. Really, it was just a little selfish of me. I didn't have a very good day. No? your Uncle Bill is doing his best to help, but I'm not making any headway here. New York's a tough town. Are you sorry we left Detroit, Dad? No, I don't think so, especially after the raw deal I got there. Things are gonna get better. I hope so. They probably will. Just seeing you after a tough day makes me feel a lot better, that's for sure. How was your day? Okay. I got tested for dance. I got a good teacher. Are you making any friends? yeah. Anybody in particular that you like? No. It's hard making friends. It's something you just have to work at, like everything else in life. Ridiculous, man. you've been following her for days. Why don't you just go up there and ask her out? I can't do that. What do you mean, you can't do that? I don't know. I'm just not ready yet. Look, this is okay for now. I just like being near her. you like being near her? Then why are we sitting back here and she's sitting way up there? I don't get it. She'll never go out with me. How do you know if you don't ask her? Her friends would probably laugh at her if she went out with a sophomore. Tell her you got left back. No, I can't do that. Then she'll think I'm stupid. Look, next period is lunch. I'll talk to her then. I can't. I can't. If you don't go up there, I'm going up there. I mean it. Will you cut it out? If you don't go up there by the time I count to ten, I'm going up there. I'll speak to her. Please, Ralphie. Ten, nine, eight, seven... Cut it out, will you? ...six, five, four... Ralphie. ...three, two, one. Come on, man. Where you going? Come on! Hi. Remember me? Ralph Manzoni. That's my best friend over there. His name is Jeremy Jones. Oh, shit. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What did you point at me for? Come on, take it easy. She wants you to call her. Get out of here. I mean it. I don't know why, but she wants you to call her. Really? yeah. Wow. Does she know I'm a sophomore? No, she doesn't know you're a sophomore. Great. I told her you were a senior. you told her I was a senior? No, I'm only kidding. I said you were the best musician in school and I heard that she was the best dancer-- How do you know she's the best dancer? you don't know nothin'. I don't know nothin'? I was the one who went in there to rap to her, not you. you see, what you needed all along was me. There's only one thing. Well, she's wearing this shirt with this guy's name written on it. Really? It's got this guy's name written on it right over the pocket. you know, like those shirts you see in the gas station. Really? What does it say? Well, I don't know. I didn't want her to think I was staring at her tits or anything, but it was a guy's name. Susan, wait up. Hi. Hi, Danny. How was dance class? What do you think? That's very nice. I don't know why you're so nervous about playing it at your school recital. The problem is in the interpretation, not in the technique. That fingering you showed me before, that really helped me a lot. yes, I know. But my value as your teacher is not just to make you a good technician. The emotion is equally important. More important, in fact. I don't like some of the things you're doing in here. What do you think about when you play this piece? What do you mean? I mean, what kind of thoughts go through your mind when you're playing it? It's a sad piece. It's kind of lonely. Sadness is just part of it. He wrote this piece before he was 20. He wrote it for a beautiful peasant girl he had seen just once in passing-- just once. So the music expresses love and parting simultaneously. The music expresses life. Play it that way. I'm sorry. I don't know what it is. It's just that sometimes my hand gets sweaty. I can't keep my fingers on the strings. It's just nervousness. Look, the only way I know to keep from getting nervous is to stare the audience down. Before you start to play, before you even pick up your bow, look out at the audience. Don't play a note until there's not a sound in that room, not a sound. you'll be surprised how fast the nervousness will go away when you're in command. I'll try that. I don't know if it's gonna work, though. Bravo! Well done. Very well done, Jeremy. Thank you, sir. I'll see you next week. Same time. Thank you. Jeremy was wonderful. Thank you very much. you must be very proud. I am indeed. I'm sorry Mr. Jones couldn't make it. I am, too. He does work very hard, you know. I'll see you tomorrow. yes, we're very fortunate, we think. Anyway, as he says, there's much more work to be done. But it was encouraging. Encouraging--I would think so. Very much so. Hi. I loved your playing. Gee, thanks a lot. I'm Susan Rollins. yeah, I know. you were really good. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Bye. Bye. I wanna call her, but I don't know what to say. Well, how about ''hello'' for a start? yeah, I know I should say ''hello.'' The problem is what comes after ''hello.'' I mean, girls like Susan are probably used to talking to guys on the phone. She probably expects me to be interesting, you know what I mean? It's easy, man. Really easy. Well, give me something to say. you don't know what to say? No. Okay. Ask her what she did today. What'd you do today? yeah, I think that's pretty good. What else. I don't know. Ask her if she thinks you should paint your cello a different color. Come on, man, be serious. What do you say to girls when you talk to them on the phone? Well, I don't usually say much. I usually listen. For instance, you know that girl Laurie I used to go out with last summer? yeah, Laurie. Honest to God, we used to stay on the phone for hours, man. All I had to say was, ''Mm-hmm. Really? No kidding.'' Man, she used to babble on for hours. No way. I kind of think I should say something. What if I made a list? yeah, make a list. Write down everything you have to say. When you finish with the list, hang up. Hi, Susan. Hello, Susan? I bet you didn't think I would call so fast. God, that sounded terrible. Hello, Susan? This is Jeremy Jones. Hello? Hello, Susan? This is Jeremy Jones. Sorry I called so early, but I'm on my way out. Wait a minute. This isn't Susan. This is her sister. Just a minute. Susan, it's for you. What time is it anyway? Oh, God. Hello? Hello? Oh, hello? Susan? Yeah. This is Jeremy Jones. Hi, Jeremy. How are you? I'm okay. How are you? Okay. Okay. I guess I called a little too early. No, that's okay. How are you? Fine. What did you do today? I woke up. I'm having some orange juice. Jeremy, it's only 9:00. Listen, I know this is a little short notice. But would you like to go out tonight? Tonight... If you don't wanna go out tonight, that's all right. No. No, that's okay. Tonight is fine. Great. Well, the movie goes on at 6:00 and 8:00. I didn't know we were going to the movies. Isn't that all right? Sure. What movie? My Little Chickadee With W.C. Fields. Is that okay? yeah. yeah, sure. Well, good. If we go to the 6:00 show, we'll avoid the lines. Gee, I'm sorry. It's okay. I never expected this. We could be waiting here all night. I don't mind waiting. I heard the usher said there are only available seats in the first two rows. I got an idea. Do you like pizza? I love pizza. Why don't we go get some instead of waiting in line? Okay. Hi, how are you? Okay, thank you. What kind of pizza do you want? Plain. A large one, please. Sure. Would you like to have a seat? Sure. Susan, let me ask you something. What if I hadn't been sent out to get a piece of chalk that day? I probably would never have met you. you believe in things like that? Like what? I don't know. Like fate. I don't know if I do. I think I'm too practical. I believe in those kind of things. That looks good. Can I have a coke, please? When you get us a chance, could you bring us some cokes? Sure. Thanks. Good. Jeremy, what are you? Sophomore. No, I know that. I meant what nationality. you knew that I was a sophomore? yeah. Did you think I wouldn't go out with you if I knew? I don't know. Things like that don't bother me. yeah. They don't bother me, either. Thank you. So, what are you? I meant nationality. Jewish. Really? yeah. Is Jones your real name? yeah. Wanna hear how it happened? yeah. My grandfather's name was Jonas Rockman. And when he came to this country from Austria, they were asking for names. Anyway, he thought he was supposed to say his last name first and his first name last. So he said Rockman Jonas. See? Somewhere along the lines, Jonas became Jones. That's it. Are you making this up? No. Really. So I guess I'm really Jeremy Rockman. Rockman. I guess I'll call you Rock. Oh, no. Don't call me Rock. I always wanted to call someone Rock. No. I won't. I'm only kidding. What are you? I'm half French-Canadian, half Scottish, English, Welsh, and Irish. Wow. Wow, I like that. you know what I like? What? When I heard you playing the cello, I couldn't believe it. you were so good. yeah, well... I guess I really feel things when I play music. yeah, I know. Are you gonna be a dancer? I hope so. I'd like to go to Juilliard. Have you ever heard of that place? Sure. Well, what are you doing in New York? My dad had to come because of a job. Wow. It must have been real hard for you, leaving all your friends. No. I didn't have that many. I'm the same way. I don't have many friends, either. So, anyway... My mother died when I was five. And I lived with my father and different relatives who came over to help, you know? Wow. That must have been rough. No, not really. Later on it was really a problem. I'm not used to talking about myself this much. I'd like to hear about it. Unless you just don't want to talk about it. No, it's okay. That's just about it, though. I guess that's why I find it hard to make friends. I'm sort of unsure of myself, I think. I don't know who I am. It's like I'm half a person. you don't remember your mother at all? No, not really. Only from pictures. Someday I'll find out who I am. Do you know who you are? Sometimes. When? I don't know. I know who I'd like to be. I'd like to be a great musician. Music is the only time when I feel like I'm me, not like my parents' little boy or some kid going to school. I mean, I feel like a whole person. you understand? Sure. I mean, it like brings the me... you know, it's like the me inside of me coming out. Doesn't make too much sense. I don't know. you're funny. Why? When I first met you... Forget it. No, tell me. What? you were kind of goofy. And I usually like serious people. Why'd you go out with me? After your concert... I just know that anybody who can play like that must be someone special. I guess that's fate. I thought you didn't believe in fate. Did I say that? yeah. I couldn't have said that. Come on, it's getting cold. I hope you had fun. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Don't say thanks. Come on, okay? I mean, I didn't do anything. yes, you did. What did I do? you made me happy tonight. Tonight was beautiful. you know what's beautiful? you're beautiful. Ralphie, I couldn't believe I said it. I swear, it was like someone else was in my head saying those words. Wait. Tell me again. you said what? I told her she was beautiful. Oh, my God. Ralphie, it just popped out. What am I telling you for anyway? I just can't believe I said it. She probably thinks you're a lovesick idiot. you wanna know something? I'm out of my mind in love. I knew this was gonna happen. I knew it. Ralphie, I swear to God, it's like everything I've ever read. My head's like spinning around. I'm just in love. Answer me one thing. Did you get anything? Come on, forget it. I can't talk to you. you got no feelings. I've got no feelings? I was inside watching the Colts and Vikings play. you called me up and told me you told some girl she was beautiful. What am I supposed to say? Forget it. Hey, Jeremy, listen. I really think it's wonderful that you and Susan have found such blissful happiness together. God bless you both. Jeremy? Hi. Hi, Susan. What are you doing here? What am I doing here? This is where I live. What are you doing here? I was just on my way to pick up some music supplies. There's a very good music store around here. Really? Where? I didn't know that. Just up the block somewhere. I didn't know there were any music stores around here. Sure there are. Between the delicatessen and the drugstore. Wait a minute. There aren't any delicatessens around here either. Sure there are. Brian's. Brian's. Brian's? I'm not very good at this. But I didn't go to any music supply store. I just wanted to walk you to school, so I came by early and waited for you. How long have you been waiting? Since 7:00. Really? yeah. I guess that's kind of dumb. No, it isn't. That's a good-morning kiss. I never kissed anyone good morning before. Come on. you waited all this time. you were really waiting since 7:00? yeah. Do you know what I like best about her? It's the little things, like the way she says hello. What? Boy, when she says hello, it's so beautiful. I don't like what's happening to you at all, man. Ralphie, it's so beautiful. I've heard her say hello before, plenty of times. Never hit me as anything special. Well, it depends on how she says it. How does she say it? It's not important. It is important. I wanna know how she says it. All right, lookit. This isn't exactly it. It goes something like this. Wait a minute. Okay, wait. you ain't listening. yeah. Come on. Okay. Now, it's special. The way she says it, it's like her voice is all low, quiet. Ready? Hello. ''Hello''? That's it? yeah, that's it. I swear, they're gonna take you away. I know they're gonna take you away. you know what it's called? What? It's called love. you know what that's called? Dumb. I'll pick you up early Saturday morning. How early? 6 a.m. 6 a.m.? Yep, 6:00 in the morning. Yeah, I suppose so. What for? It's a surprise. Well, okay. Call me before you're ready to leave and make sure I'm up. Yeah, I'll call. But you gotta be ready at 6:00. 6:00 in the morning. I can't believe it. Won't you tell me where we're going? Nope. Come on, just a little hint. No. Just one. All right. One hint, that's it, all right? Okay, you ready? Look at him! Wow. Look at that stride. He's beautiful. yeah. Wow. Now you know why they call it breezing? yes, they run so smooth. They just sort of breeze by. yeah. It's kind of like music. Do they train like this every morning? yeah. They start out here at about dawn. Look at him go. When you said we were going some place special, I never thought I'd wind up here. Don't you like it? I love it. Great. It's just sort of weird seeing you at a racetrack. Is that okay? Oh, my God, it's fantastic. Great. you know, I used to spend every summer here about two, three years ago, for three years in a row. I used to be like a hot walker for my uncle. I used to feed the horses and walk 'em. I was a hot walker. That's what they'd call us. Boy. After we'd breeze 'em, we'd walk 'em off. Oh, God. It was so nice. Jeremy, you amaze me. you know, it's funny. My dad used to be the same as me when he was a kid. He loved horses. He did the same job I used to do. yeah. But now... Now he doesn't have time for that kind of stuff. He's too busy. That's too bad. Come on. I'll show you Bill Wyngate's farm. He used to be a really good friend of my dad's. There's a horse I really wanna show you here. He's a gray gelding. He's one of Mr. Odom's horses. He's really fantastic. No. No, that's not him. Here he is. This is Sinbad. yeah, his sire was Never Bend, out of Anambriack's mare. Know what that means? No. Well, a sire means the father, and the mare is the mother. Wanna feed it a piece of sugar? yeah. Here. Usually horses with lines full of blood are mean. He's good. Well, look it. Hold your hand out flat. yeah, flat. That's it. See, these horses are in bred and they're really jumpy, but he's okay. He dropped it. Here. There you go. Yeah, come on. I'll show you some other horses. Do you ever bet on the races? No. I handicap them for fun, but I don't bet. Why not? I guess I'd rather spend my money on records, music, stuff like that. Well, can you give me a good tip? yeah, sure. Billy Blue in the fourth. Are you sure he'll win? Absolutely. That's Triple Bend still in the lead. Tunic and Favor City in a close second and third, with Peace Corps falling far behind. As they come into the stretch, that's Triple Bend and Tunic. That's Triple Bend and Tunic. Triple Bend and Tunic. As the cross the wire, it's Triple Bend. Does anyone else know you do this? Nope. It's a secret. Good, 'cause I wouldn't tell 'em if I were you. Okay. you know what else I do? What? Promise you won't laugh? It's kind of stupid. I promise. Sometimes when I'm walking down the street, I see some guy ahead of me-- you know, just any guy. I wanna race him. you know, just me and him. And I create an imaginary finish line and I call the race in my head. I don't believe it. And they're off. The man in the blue suit has a two-length lead as they come out of the starting gate, and Jeremy Jones is a disappointing second. On the outside, Jeremy makes his move. At the sixteenth pole, and it's Jones and the man in the blue suit neck and neck. As they come down the home stretch, the man in the blue suit and Jeremy Jones. The man in the blue suit and Jeremy Jones. As they cross the wire... And it's Jeremy Jones. you sure you wanna do that? yeah, sure. Okay. Oh, brother. Susan, let me ask you something. We've been going out together for a while now. Well, have you been having fun? yeah. Haven't you? Oh, yeah. yeah, of course. That's not what I meant. What I mean is, well, I'm kind of serious, you know? I mean, basically I'm kind of a serious person. Well, I guess I'm kind of quiet. I was just wondering if you were having a good time. Jeremy, sometimes I don't understand you. Do you really feel you have to ask me that? I mean, I really like spending the afternoon here with you, talking, looking out at the rain... ...playing chess. I know it's not too exciting. Look, if you'd rather go someplace else, we could go. Jeremy, you don't have to take me places. I mean, that's not what a relationship is all about. Do you really feel that way? Yes, I feel that way. Of course I feel that way. Just spending a day together, talking, It's great. I'm glad. Let me ask you something else. Remember that guy you used to go out with? Danny? yeah. Well, I don't mean to start nothing, you know. I thought you said you weren't gonna see him anymore. I haven't been seeing him since I started going out with you. yeah, well... Ralphie said that he saw you with him yesterday... ...after school. Oh, that. I just had to speak to him. Did you tell him you weren't gonna see him anymore? I told him something much better than that. What? I told him that I loved you. Did you really tell him that? I really told him that. Do you really love me? Yeah. Is that okay? Is that okay? God, yeah. I mean, like I feel the same way about you. It's just that I can't say it yet. You don't have to say it. Just so long as I know that's how you feel. That's how I feel. What are you thinking about? Nothing, really. Is anything wrong? No. I'm just wispy. Wispy? What's that? I don't know. It's a happy kind of... ...quiet. Something like that. Are you happy? Yes. Are you? Yeah. Yeah, I'm kind of... Wispy. Don't make fun. I wonder if anyone will ever land on North Carolina Avenue. You own it. Yes. I'll probably land on it a lot. See, I told you, it's always been the other way. Eight. Baltic Avenue. And that gives you a run... Ned. Ned, I need some help. No outside help. Yes, I do. Ned, I need some help. I'm sorry, Eunice, I'm tied up. Hi, honey, come on in. Darling. Come here, darling. I want to introduce you to my friends. This is my niece Susan from Detroit. Isn't she lovely? And this is Roy and Tina. Hello. And this is Frank and... Hi, how are you? Forgive me, I don't seem to be able to remember your name. Sherry. Sherry Spencer. Sherry Spencer, Frank's date. Or is she yours, darling? I can't seem to remember. You're my date, darling. That's reassuring. It was nice to meet you. You, too. Come on, darling, can we play? Whose roll? Hi. How was your day? Good day. Special day. Well, honey, I guess it just takes some people a little longer than others ..to realize their mistakes. I don't understand. Wellington Bryant himself called me today and asked me to come back. To Detroit? Of course to Detroit. You're not going, are you? Not going home? Honey... Five-year contract, 20% increase, ..stock options, ..an apology ..the whole works. Oh, my God. When do we leave? Right away. Right away? I thought I'd try for the day after tomorrow. That's all the time I need to wrap up my affairs here. I'm only with Parkinson on a consulting basis anyway. What about my school? I forgot to tell you. Mr. Bryant is on the board, and he assured me ..that you could go back to Jefferson as a junior ..and not lose any time or any credits for the two months you've missed. We're leaving New York in two days. Sure. Anything wrong? Well, Dad, I have friends here. Honey, friends - you've got hundreds of friends in Detroit. I know, Dad. That's not what I mean. I know it's hard breaking off relationships, but, Susan, it's only been a couple of months. That's hardly enough time to have anything serious. Dad, there's a boy. I don't understand. I can't talk in here. Can we please... Sure. Let's go over here and sit down and talk, okay? Now, what about this boy? There's a boy I'm seeing, and it's become serious. you mean that young man from this summer? What's his name? Danny? No, not Danny. You met Jeremy. Susan, you've only seen him once or twice. Three weeks and four days, exactly. Honey, I know this can seem very serious to you at the time, but... ...there'll be a hundred other boys in your life before you marry. And the boys at Jefferson are probably lined up to wait for you right now. Yeah. Honey, I know I dropped this in your lap. It's a lot to swallow at once. I think you'll see that everything's going to be fine. In the meantime, I've got a lot of work to catch up on. Yeah, I know. Dad, I'm happy for you, really. It's just that it's so sudden. It's going to be okay. Susan, what's wrong? Where's the light? Damn it. What's the matter? It's so awful. What's so awful? Please, tell me. Last night was so beautiful. After you and me kissed, I stood there for a long time. I could still feel your lips on mine. I could still feel you all over my body. And I thought to myself, ''I'm a woman and he loves me.'' Then I went inside. I just wanted to be alone. I just wanted to think about you the whole rest of the night. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, I know. And inside, there were a bunch of people there. And my dad was there, and he told me we were moving back to Detroit. In two days we're leaving. Detroit? My dad got this new job. We have tickets, I gotta pack. When will you be back? Jeremy, I'm not coming back. Don't you understand? Oh, my God. Jeremy, what are we gonna do? I've always been so alone. I've always felt so outside of things. I never had any friends. I never had anybody I could be really close to. Look, you can stay in New York. you'll stay with your aunt, and maybe my dad will get your dad a job. you don't have to go. Jeremy, I'm not coming back. Don't you understand? I'm not coming back. I've never had anyone I could really be close to. I've always felt outside of things. Jeremy, what are we gonna do? what are we gonna do? Coffee? No, thanks, not me. Well, we're all ready for you. Why don't we run through our first take? Sure. Let's take it from the top. Okay, stand by. We reviewed your position. We're in good shape. Fine. Hi, Dad. Dad? Yeah? I didn't know where to look for you. It's all right, son. Stay there. I'll be right out. How'd you know I was here? I called your office. Anything wrong? No. Dad, I gotta talk to you. Well, not here, son. Not now, I can't. Look, I'll talk to you at home tonight, all right? Come on. Sorry... I'll never get over it. I tried, Ralphie. I went to see my father. It just wasn't any use. He can't help. She's really leaving. What am I gonna do? If you keep talking like that, they're gonna take you away. What's the gate number, please? Gate number 3, directly down this aisle and then to your right. Honey, it's gate number 3. Why don't you kids meet us down there? But hurry, okay? We don't have much time, sir. Do you have any luggage? I checked it in downstairs. We'll have to carry your sister on that plane. Don't worry, she'll get over it. He's a nice boy. Just say that you'll never forget me. How can you say that? Susan, I love you. NorthWest Airlines, flight number 147, service for Detroit, is in the final boarding process at Gate 3. All the other passengers have boarded, sir, so please hurry. Thank you very much.
