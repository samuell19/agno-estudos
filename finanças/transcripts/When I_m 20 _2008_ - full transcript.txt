When I Am 20 A film by Phan Đăng Di Why don’t you ever say anything? Come back on Friday, please! But you can’t wear torn socks. Why is your hair so greasy? I was washing my hair when the water was cut off. It’s disgusting! He’s as old as my father. But you’ve never met your father. That’s how I imagine him anyway. The old men want me to talk. I have nothing to say to them. They all have a bad breath. It stinks. Some don’t, you know! But I don’t want to talk with them… Why do they insist? Because you have a sweet voice. That’s not true. Grandmother says I have a harsh voice. Serves you right! You shout at her all the time! But she always spits betel juice all over the house. Oh, God! Where did I leave the mortar? Grandma will complain all night. Electricity, water supply and food this month. It’s all paid for. Please sign here! Otherwise you’ll claim I haven’t given you the money. What about the garbage fee? You pay it! Can’t you pay it? This month? Here… You’re not giving me money for betel? No. You spit it all over the place. How about the mortar? You said you would buy one. Where is it? No! On second thought there will be no mortar. You always spit betel juice everywhere. In that case, I’ll spit anywhere I want. You’re so silly! I’m tired of this! Go to sleep! I won’t go to bed til I have a piece of betel. It’s over there. Go ahead. I lost one more tooth today. I can’t chew without grinding it first. I need my mortar. What’s this? Looks like a rooster. It’s a phoenix. Not a cock. How can you call it a phoenix? You can’t do anything, all you do is criticize everything. Our neighbors used to beg me to make phoenix betel for their wedding. You make it so awfully. I’ll ask others for my wedding. Only a monkey would marry you. This is a phoenix-shaped piece of betel. I brought it to ask for your hand in marriage. Wanna marry me? Be serious. It’s an important matter. Think again: do you want to marry me? My grandmother said that only a monkey would want to marry me. Do you want to be a monkey? It’s cold outside. I don’t want to be walking the street right now. I am soaked in sweat after each trick. I have to take bath. But they say it’s not good… ...to take more than three baths a day. If only I could go for you. Dear! You couldn’t stand it. Why not? It takes a lot of work. If you can, I can do it too. Don’t be so sure. You’re not as patient as me. It will make you so mad. You’d try to strangle your customers and they will kill you. It can’t be that bad. I’m telling you. You ever want to strangle anyone? Always. Sometimes I want them dead… ...after we make love. Anyone ever pleases you? Of course! I was with one of them today. Where? Right here. What does he look like? He’s interesting and tall. He must be 1.8 m. So tall… Such a tall man must have a long one? It’s about this. Oh no, it must be like this. Is there any water? Yes. I’ll bring it to you. I don’t know your name yet. Some chicken legs? Umh! From September people on the island start to catch mountain crabs and cellanas. The sea water is very clear season. If you dive down, you can touch corals. Is there jelly-fish? What’s wrong with jelly-fish? Jelly-fish as awful. I hear that if you touch them, you’ll get all itchy. It’s painful on your skin too. It hurts. There’s no jelly-fish. You’re just saying that! How do you know? You’ve never been there. You’ll see when you get there tomorrow. Tomorrow? I bought the tickets. We leave at 11 tonight. Train E1. That’s crazy. We’re not even ready. Break our piggy bank and we’ll go. Stop joking! I have a date tonight. I don’t care. Our train leaves at 11 pm. Go by yourself if you like. See if you can without me. 11 pm.
