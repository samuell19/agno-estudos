The biggest one I ever had, and he got away. This is not gonna work. I got a better idea. I've got it. Every time you got it, I get it. Come here, mastermind. You go outta that door, and when I say "go," open it. That's all. Have no fear. Okay. [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! All right, come on over here, man-of-war. [WHIMPERS] This is the way we do things right. Okay. All right? Go. [GRUNTS, WHIMPERING] You almost broke my skull. You're supposed to pull my tooth. Take it easy, kid. I'm sorry. Just back up. Oh... All right? Right. Whoo-hoo! Look at that tooth. It's a whopper. And look at that root. Say, if I belonged to the Elks, I'd wear this on my watch-chain... if I had a watch-chain. You pumpkinhead. That's not your tooth. That's the doorknob. Oh. No wonder my tooth still hurts me. Oh! Oh! Oh! My poor, little, sweet, little, adorable, lovable, sweet, little, butchy-wutchy tooth. Listen, we gotta get that tooth out, or we'll never get to sleep. I got it. Again? This idea will revolutionize dentistry. I never knew this would start a revolution. Now, you got nothin' to worry about, kid, see? Tie this up here like that. Now, when I say "three," all you gotta do is jump off the ladder. And your tooth comes out... like that. Somethin' tells me I shouldn't do this. Oh, don't be nervous. All right, now, you watch for my countin'. Ready. One...two... Two and a half. Quiet. Three. [YELPING] I... [MUFFLED] It's out. You got it. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! You got another one. Ha-ha-ha-ha! You got 'em all. You got me baldheaded in the mouth. Why, you... [GRUNTS, WHIMPERS] My tooth. What's the matter? I'm through...definitely. All right, then you go to the dentist. Oh, no, please, no. Not that. Oh, my tooth. Hey, why don't we blast? [WHISPERS] With what? I still got a giant firecracker from the Fourth of July. At last, you got a hunk of brain. Yeah? Where'd I get it? Never mind. Go on. What is he gonna do now? Aw, take it easy. Relax. It'll be over in a flash. Close your eyes and open your mouth. But remember, this is the last time. You said it. Close. [WHIMPERS] Hey, Moe! Shut up. [WHIMPERS] Shut up! [EXPLOSION] Ow! Ow! [SCREAMING] This is it. CURLY: I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid. What a liar I am. Hello, Mrs. Smith? Dr. Tug wants to know when your husband is having those other teeth pulled. Oh, he died after the last extraction. [WHIMPERS FAINTLY] [WHINES] MAN: Owww! [WHIMPERING] [GROANING] Hey, wait a minute. I'm not through yet. Oh, yes, you are. Say, what did you do before you became a dentist? Why, uh, I-- I was a butcher. [WHIMPERS] [SPUTTERS] As far as I'm concerned, you're still one. TUG: Right this way, gentlemen. Look, doc, we're defense workers. If you wanna cut down on absenteeism, yank this guy's tooth. He won't let us sleep. He's sabotaging the war effort. What do you say? Why, it'd be a pleasure. Say, sugar, how'd you like to come over to my house and see my coffee? Fresh. Oh, yeah. Ground today. Just a moment, now. Please. [GOBBLES] I-- I just wanna test your tooth for sensitivity. Come on, now, open your mouth. Ungh! That's it, now let me see-- Ow! Oh! He cut me with that knife. He's a butcher, I tell you. I heard the other fella say so. Get outta my way. Come here, come here. Let me get outta here. You can't get outta here. Sit down. Sit down. There. You calm him down while I go and consult with my partner, Dr. Yank. Oh! No! Oh, me! Oh, my! Oh, woe is me! You're a coward. You got nothin' to be afraid of. Step aside. I'll show you. Sit in the chair and be calm. Relax. That screwy patient needs his first-right bicuspid extracted. So what? He's got me so worn out from fighting with him, I haven't got the strength to do it. You take him. All right. I'll fix it. Ahem. [MUTTERS] You relax in the chair and close your eyes, like this. Then you won't see what he's doin', and before you know it, it's all over. [LAUGHS] Mmph! Mmph! Hey, doc. There's somethin' I oughta tell you. Not now. But you don't understand-- Hand me that towel. Doc, listen. You see-- Quiet. Please do as I say. I've got to work fast. Here. [CREAKING] [MOANING] [WHIMPERS] Ah, there it is. A perfect extraction. Here, hold that just a second. [WHIMPERS] I'll be right back. Say, doc. He's not the patient. I am. Ohh. Heh-heh. Why, you numbskull. But, Moe-- You double-crossin' rat, you. Pullin' my tooth when my back is turned. Ooh! Ooh! I-- Ooh! Ooh! [HUFFING, WHINES] Where am I? What are you doing down there? What happened? Nothin' yet. Oh! Ohh. Ooh. Ooh. Hey, look. You knocked my tooth out. Good. Now maybe we can get some sleep. Good night. Good night. Good night. [SNORING LOUDLY] Whoo-whoo. [♪]
