Is she deaf? No. She can't talk? Stop asking me. Then, she won't bug me like you. Is she scary? No. How old is she? Don't ask. Damn it. Nice chicken! It's so big! Let's go. Hurry! I don't like it here. I'm not going, I don't wanna go. Come here! You pest! - Why'd you hit me? You pest! Let's go! THE WAY HOME This is Sang-Woo, your grandson. I'm sorry I never visited... I've been having a hard time. His father? We split up ages ago. I was only 17 when we ran off, so now what can I do? It's so hard to find a job these days. I'll find one as fast as I can. I had a shop, but I lost it. Only got debt now. It'll be two months at most. I'll come back after I find a job. He's used to being alone, so he won't cause trouble. Sang-woo, say hi to your grandma. No! Don't be rude! She's dirty. This is some underwear. And nourishment for the elderly. Those are Sang-woo's. He'll just eat them on his own. I better catch the last bus. No! No, I can't! I have to go today. Listen to your grandma, and be a good boy. Got it? Ouch! Retard! Dummy! Stupid mute! Deaf retard! What're you looking at? Where are you going? Hello! How are you?

Over there! Oh, gross! Come on, hurry up! Kill it! Hurry and kill it! Take it away! Kill it! What if it comes back? Kill it! Don't let it go! This is so annoying. What's wrong? Why isn't it working? I need batteries! Give me money! I need batteries! Give me money! Give me money, I'll tell mom to pay you back. I can't play my game without battery. Stupid. You're no help! No, don't! Dirty feet... Cubix... Rock, scissors, paper. Rock. Rock. Damm it... Hello! Hello! Can you hear me? What? Where can I buy batteries? I can't hear you. Come here. Batteries! Batteries! Batteries? - Yes! Come here! Go down this road, and there's a school. Keep going straight. Then you'll find a gate. Go past the gate, and there's a small shop. What are you looking for? Batteries. Go this way, that way, and then that way. I don't get it. Go this way, that way, and that way, then straight. Where are you going? What? What do I want to eat? You don't even have money...

I don't care! I'm not playing house with you. A dummy like you will never get married. There's gonna be more girls than boys when we get older. Too bad for you. Can you cook Kentucky chicken? No but I can eat it. Is Cheol-yee your boy friend? Why? Is the bus really coming? Off to sell pumpkins? They look great. You really grew them well. How did you do it? We can't do it that well. Please give me a hand! Your cabbages look really fresh. Yeah, they sure are. These shoes are great, huh? They fit you perfectly. They're the best Design and colors. Wow! The shoes make you look great. 2,300 Won. Why'd you get off? Is it the wrong bus? This one wrong, too? Granny, this is the right bus. Wait. That old woman across the street asked about you. Her knees hurt, so she can't go outside. Why don't you see her? No. I said no. Leave me alone! That was funny. Your joke is so funny. I can't stop laughing Where are you going now? Over there. Bye. - Bye. Hey, boy. Grandma's been asking what you want to eat. Choco Pie. Hi. Have a seat. Sit down. I'm all alone today. My knees? Same as always. Heard your grandson is here. You should've brought him. Choco pie? Two? I'll give you some more. It's on me. Keep it. Please keep it. I don't need any. Sell it for your grandson. Please, I don't need any. Thank you. Come by again. I can't visit you because of my knees. Come again. Before one of us die. Go. Go. Be careful! This doll is really pretty. Yeah? You think so, too? Yeah, but it'll get dirty easily, since it's white. I'll just be careful. Anyway, know what it's called? What? "Wacky Bunny." Weird, isn't it? What kind of name is that? I heard it's in fashion. I wanna sit with Cheol-yee. You go yourself. Don't worry, granny. I'll get off with Sang-woo. Cheol-yee, do you know that girl? Where? No. No. Sangwoo's grandma isn't getting on? She said she'll come later. She has work to do. How do you know what she says? You can hear her? I can't hear her, I just know. Rock, scissors, paper. Rock. Rock. I'll save it for tomorrow. What took you so long? The sky is clear. The wind is fresh. It's a happy day. My friend gave me a flower watch for my birthday. It doesn't tick, or show the time... Bye, Cheol-yee. Bye. Run fast! The crazy cow is coming! Faster! It's coming down the hill! I'm serious! It's the crazy cow. Really chasing him. Hurry up. I said hurry! Are you coming? Where are you? I said where are you? I can't see you. Where are you? A little closer. Yeah, stay there. Don't fall asleep. Are you sleeping? The crazy cow is coming! Run! Run faster! That chicken... Faster! Faster! It's right behind you! Faster! Faster! Sang-woo! Sang-woo! I looked everywhere to play with you. I asked Cheol-yee and even went to your house. Got any hair mousse? Finished? What's this? This is awful! I told you to cut a little. Not like this! I can't meet Hae-yeon like this. It ran out of batteries. Dummy. But Hae-yeon might come over. You didn't have to come. I saw him on the road before. I'm okay. I'm old enough to die. I'm just making people around me suffer. What's that? Nourishment for old people. I don't need that expensive stuff. You should take it. We have lots of stuff at home but this is our only cloth. Those are ugly. Why'd she put the game in? Watch out! The crazy cow is coming! Run! Look out! Don't let it catch you The cow is coming! It's dangerous! Run away! Run! Run away! The crazy cow is coming! Run away! Hurry! Be careful! Hurry! Hide! I'm sorry about before. Then you have to apologize twice. Look again carefully. This means, "I'm sick." This means, "I miss you." Write it again. Can't you do this? You can't speak or use the phone, so you have to write to me. Grandma, if you get sick, just send a blank letter. Then I'll know it's you, and I'll come fast. Okay? Mom, take the nutrients I gave you. Eat well, and take care of yourself. I'll come visit often, okay? Before the lunar new year. You should wear warmer clothes. Mom, I'll bring you some clothes next time. You got anything to say to grandma? Mom, I guess he's shy. Thanks for looking after him. The bus is coming. Mom, I'm leaving, so please do what I told you. Don't worry and eat well, okay? written and directed by LEE, Jeong-Hyang
