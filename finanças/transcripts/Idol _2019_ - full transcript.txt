I gave my son handjobs. His mental age was four, but he grew quickly. I first started doing it when he was 13. He didn't know how to relieve the urge and would scrape his skin and bleed. When I was doing it... his moans pierced my ears. It began as a therapy but there was a weird sense of guilt in that sound. Waking up in the morning I would wish we never existed. But thinking back it was the best thing I did for him. I should've done it until the day I died. I regret not doing that. Hey. What is he doing? What? Couldn't you be more prepared? Did the field trip change your mind? If there is a measure in place to manage the nuclear waste... I'll help the governor convince the residents there. You know this business was started by the heads of the party? I had no idea. Here he comes. Good afternoon. Johan's in trouble. Thanks to excellent PR you've elevated yourself from a herbal physician to a district councillor. You're excellent at maintaining your image. I can't seem to find any dirt on you. Chinese Herbal Clinic Koo Myung-hui So splintering from the party was the reason you got on TV. Being a Chinese university graduate didn't do you any favours though. Does he answer your calls? Yes, of course. C-Councillor Koo's... He's more popular than you are, Governor. But the thing is we're going in one direction but you're going in another. What's your plan? Considering our children's future I believe that inconvenience is better than apprehension. Come on, say what you mean for a change. Instead of this PR talk. What's the point of taking economy flights to Japan on your own dime? A single search will reveal the truth. It's as if you're putting on a show to become governor. The residents aren't as ignorant as you believe, Councillor. I don't know much about that. We're all connected tightly interwoven like a spider web. If you try to mess it up would the spider stay put? Councillor. - Good afternoon, Councillor. - Hello there. - Thank you. - It's an honour. - Seo-won? - Yes? Did something happen at home? I didn't get any calls. - Councillor. - Yes. - Good to meet you. - Thank you, sir. Be well. Seo-won, sit down. Yes, sir. My apologies. Are you back, dear? Johan's in trouble. Dialling: Wife Say NO To Nuclear Power Plants Say NO to Nuclear Power Plant Development It's OK, you can leave that, Councillor. Fancy putting ads on taxis. There are too many loonies around, right? What are these people thinking? Praise the Lord... Honey? Why didn't you answer the phone? What's going on? Turn it off! - Why... why? - No lights! - No. - What's wrong? No... No lights. Why? What is it? W-What's that behind you? What happened? Our son... Johan took the car last night. Who is he? How would I know? Did he have an ID or a wallet in his pockets? He didn't have a single cent. Where's Johan? Open the door! Why, honey? Give me the key. Johan, it's Mum. Johan, please answer me! Johan! Johan! Open the door! - Johan! - Hold on! Where did it happen? He drove on the coastal road. I want to hear it from you! He came out of nowhere when I was on my way home. And? I wanted to take him to the hospital... but I came home instead. Did he die on the way? Were you drunk? That's why you took the coastal road. Was there anyone else? - Any witnesses? - No. Look at me. You're sure no one saw? Yeah. Tell the cops that. We have to find out who he is... Find out? How? The punishment for a hit-and-run gets harsher the longer it drags out. It has already been a day. It's not a hit-and-run! What about the body? What do you propose then? If he turns himself in now he might get away with just a probation. We can't sweep this under the carpet. If we do, we'll be slaves to it all our lives. It's your car. You take the blame. Johan? Yeah, the main wing. I'm here! What are you saying? Speak properly! Yeah. I see you. I saw you! Joong-sik! Hey! What took you so long? Calm down! Detective! - My son is on his honeymoon. - I see. I think there's been a misunderstanding. His name came up when we ran the victim's fingerprints through our database. Oh no. Did you see him? Did you? I was too scared to. Hell! What are you crying for then? - Show him the body, please. - Certainly. See, it's not him. Not the floater, the hit-and-run. I'm sorry. John Doe No. No way... It's not him? My son isn't here. He shouldn't be. The number you are trying to call... Mr Yoo, please take another... It's not him! Bloody hell... My boy isn't supposed to be here. It's him. It's our Bu-nam. They've identified the body. He was the kindest boy in the world. What's going on? No, please... this can't be. It's not Bu-nam. He can't be here. Son of popular governorship candidate Koo Myung-hui turned himself in for a hit-and-run today. My son will cooperate fully with the investigation... Being the chairperson of the Nuclear Power Plant Committee this turn of events is a huge shock to his supporters. Was he drunk? Did he drink? Why did he wait two days to turn himself in? Did he turn himself in because dashboard camera footage surfaced? I am ashamed to face the victim's family... but I wanted my son... to fully accept his mistake and turn himself in on his own accord. I'm so sorry. Will you forfeit your governorship candidacy? That will be all, please excuse us! One more comment, please! His father runs a hardware store in Seoul and installs air conditioners. The victim was mentally challenged. I looked into it just in case. He has a long criminal record. Over ten counts for buying sexual services. Who? The father went with his son, I think. They have similar rap sheets. Why am I even here then? Was it you? Did you do this? Did you kill my boy? - Talk to me! - He turned himself in. Let him be. He just wants to talk. I don't get it. It's killing me! Joong-sik, the councillor's here. I'm... I'm so sorry, Mr Yoo. Let's go inside and talk. Wait a minute! What about Ryeon-hwa? Pardon me? My daughter-in-law was with him. Did you see her? She stays with him even when he poops. Even if there was an accident she should have been with him. I'm sorry. You're laughing? You scum! What's so funny about killing a person? Let's just talk! - We can talk this through! - Scum! - What did you do? - Stop it! Is she dead too? Tell me! Why my boy, of all people? I have to talk to them! - I'm sorry! - Stop! No photos, please! Wrap things up here. - Out of the way! - What did you do? Could we get a comment? One comment, please! Let's go. Stop! Stop! Stop! Come on, step on it! Stop the van! - Did we run him over? - Joong-sik! I met with our attorney. He might get away with just a probation. Where's the woman? What woman? The dead man's... woman. What are you getting at? He was still alive when he was brought here. Are you asking me what I did? You really didn't see anyone else? A witness could prove that Johan took the victim home and an autopsy will reveal the time of death. If there's a witness, it's all over. It's already over. Just not for you. What do you mean? Why did you put the body back? What? Didn't you say we should pay for our crimes? You're fine with being charged for a hit-and-run but not with tampering of the body? - The severity is different. - No! You made that call because you know a hit-and-run is less detrimental to your career than tampering with the body. And you have the cheek to ask me what I did with the girl? You call this a hotel? - Hello? - Dae-hee. Did you get anything? I'll call you back. No cash, no personal items. There was just one thing. Sir. So they were here on their honeymoon? Oh, you didn't know. This kind of case is quite common. Illegal immigrants running away after getting their marriage certificates. Who's the broker? Congratulations on your pregnancy! What are you doing? - My hair! - Where is she? - Where did she run to? - What do you mean? You took the girl! Ouch! Look at this. You're sure she didn't run off? Hell, you really are a moron. What did you say? It's because you didn't get her a marriage certificate! Let her go. We can talk this out! Please stop it! What did you just say? Are you deaf? No girl wants to be a surrogate womb and get deported! You set them up months ago but you never gave her a marriage certificate! Keeping looking at it. Maybe you'll find its name on it. If I were her, I would have kept mum too! Have some manners when you talk to him. The victim's family lodged complaints to the police today. The police stated that the road was rarely used. Come with me. Refund the clients who were interrupted and send them on their way. - The door's locked. - Sheesh. Bring him some water. Life sure is unpredictable. I'm a detective. How did this even happen? They left the dead dude there and kidnapped the chick. You knew, didn't you? If anyone were to know, it'd be you. You took her four months ago. What the bloody hell did you just say? Has she called you? No. She'd have called me if anything happened. She was abducted. You lowlife rats. Get lost. Take this! Go to hell, you dirtbag! Mena! My goodness! Stop! I talked to the prosecutor. Incoming call: Chief Prosecutor Kim He asked me how we'd like to proceed. Did he confess to driving under influence? He might have left it out. - Check and make sure he didn't. - Honey. Let's go by the book. The consequences will be dire if we get found out for hiding anything. Did you contact the Special Committee? Yes, the meeting is set for tomorrow. Councillor. Are you thinking about dropping out? A man is dead. But it was an accident. Is there anything else? I've looked into the missing woman. There's a security camera outside the hotel. She was caught on camera just after the time of the accident. The police believe that since she's an illegal immigrant she fled after his death. So? Pardon me? Did I ask you to look into that? Why did you act on your own accord? I... should've sent you to a nicer hotel. I'm sorry. I'll... find Ryeon-hwa. I'm sorry, son. The body was returned to the scene and the wife was kidnapped? Yes. Then why did the driver turn himself in? It's your job to figure that out. Who filled your head with this theory? I can't tell you. Mr Yoo, I don't know which undies I put on or what I ate for breakfast this morning but I'm certain your theory is wrong. Did we miss it? We discovered this while checking a dashboard camera for an unrelated accident. It's such a secluded road only garbage trucks and drunk drivers use it. The police don't set up any checkpoints here. You should get a lawyer first. There aren't any crosswalks or sidewalks so the accident could have been the victim's fault. Stay down. All businesses have favourable and adverse effects. We cannot put up with the negatives for the overwhelming positives. Even if there's a 1% chance of it being detrimental to our lives... then I believe we should have a plan in place to deal with the worst scenario before we proceed with the project. He's putting on quite a show. So even the almighty Koo Myung-hui is going down. Lastly, I'd like to apologise to my fellow members of this party. In view of Councillor Koo's resignation we'll select a new chair for the Power Plant Committee in our next meeting. Hello? Well... I need to find someone. Call me from your cell phone. Yongho Services Hel... Yes, sir? I see you're calling from public phone to keep your identity concealed. Privacy is paramount to us too. That's why our fees aren't cheap. Ease of mind comes at a price, after all. There are ways to do this without you ever getting involved. If you change your mind call me from your cell phone. A witness has come forward There's bad energy there. Us locals would never walk on that road. That night, I heard the brakes screech followed by a loud bam! Like a watermelon exploding. - So I knew something was hit. - I see. Then, I saw a girl running away. She was in a rush to get somewhere. Where? Well... how would I know? Did you see the car? Yeah, it drove off real quick. Did you go to the crime scene? I told you we steer clear of that road. Since he took off I thought he drunkenly hit something. You didn't see anything. Why did you come here? There was... another person there. What? The girl looked like she was trying to get away from someone. - From who? - Come on. The vegetation was pretty dense so I couldn't get a good look. It's OK, just tell me what you saw. This man was there. Who? Me? Are you insane? How did you injure your leg? Stop that! She was last seen near the bus terminal. She took a bus to Incheon. Check with Immigrations. They're experts at finding illegal immigrants. She saw something. She was being chased. I'll consent to my son's autopsy. My goodness. Councillor! Please sit down. OK. So you witnessed the accident? Yes, I was there. I've given my statement. Don't you worry. We can't have this incident interfering with your committee work. What colour was the car? Black, of course! Who put you up to this? Put me up to what? Why are you lying? Why would you say that, Councillor? You didn't see the accident, did you? I didn't see the accident but I did see the girl running away! The cops verified it too! The girl in yellow! A Chinese national. Yes, in her late twenties. Yes. Her online shopping list and family info? How do I give it to you? Stop eating that. You'll do what? He's so thoughtless. No... nothing like that. I just need you to find her. Yes. Send me the address. The dead has it better than the living. I prefer being a caregiver to being all alone so don't you worry. I'll hang on to his phone for a while. And your father? He has no need for a phone. Why did you change the door passcode? I changed it years ago, son. Johan is well. Out of sight, out of mind. Blood ties don't mean anything. Do you have $10,000? This is the deed for my house. Get the cash and drop it off at this address tomorrow. After the trial I'll transfer the house to you, Mum. Leave it at locker #28, Incheon 1028 Forever Education Centre If you can't find it, it's OK. No, I found it. It's right here. You're back. Why didn't you answer your phone? Your sister's restaurant is near my office. My apologies for dropping in unannounced. Yes. Even a killer should be given a chance to explain himself. Why are you giving him that? They wanted to see Bu-nam. My boy was alive for six hours. Lying there on the cold concrete. "Daddy..." Calling out for me. When I think about that... Bu-nam... If you were me, what would you do? - Tell me. - My poor Bu-nam. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. When a boat passes it leaves a trail in its wake. I'd be lying if I say I know how you feel. Mother. What? You brought me here to help. If I can exchange my life for your son's life I'd gladly do so. But the thing is what's the point of showing us this gruesome photo? Gruesome? It's not a fair trade. You've already lived a long life. Right, it's about money then. Mother! You had to pour fuel on the fire? Listen, lady. We've got plenty of money. Thanks to you we got plenty of insurance money! That's the only explanation I could come up with. What? My daughter-in-law is missing. I find you suspicious. If you had found her and did something to her... If I find out you did that... You friggin' dirtbags. It won't matter who you are I'll rip you to shreds. My goodness. There is just no talking to him. Get out. Get the hell out of my house! Joong-sik! I'm sorry. Hey! That was too much of you! Did you have to swear to the councillor, no less? Are you nuts? You must be. Do you really think they hurt Ryeon-hwa? This is tough on me too. No one is coming to my shop. My customers blame us for ruining the councillor's political career. Ryeon-hwa... is pregnant. What? Really? Is our family cursed or something? Should we go to a shaman? I was told to aim for the neck of the most powerful man in our country. I won't find anything until I do that. Find what? Have you been to a shaman? Is it really Bu-nam's baby? - But... - I terminated his insurance. Why? Why did you do that? I didn't want anyone to hurt him for the insurance money. My goodness... Leave. Tell them to leave too. I didn't come here for the insurance money. Contact the sister. Who? What do you mean who? Ryeon-hwa's sister, of course. I heard they came to Korea together. Why didn't you tell me that earlier? Did you even ask? Did you ever consult me for anything? You're too much, really... One moment, please. Allow me to apologise. Don't take what my mother-in-law said to heart. I don't have a lot of say in this. I heard that. You're saying my words don't mean crap? Get your husband. He took Father to the restroom. Yeah, my tummy feels weird too. She's a real pain in the behind. I'm sorry. Copying... Gonggu Online Shopping Baby Step Community for Development Disability Kkam! Come eat! Kkam, come eat! Kkam, come eat! Kkam, come eat! Kkam. Come eat! Kkam! It's between you and me. If it weren't for you... You have been so helpful. I would like to try this again. Please help us. Thank you. But Joong-sik's too stubborn to go back on his decision. What? You like what? I see. I understand. I'll ask him. OK. Crazy dude. - Prosecutor wants five years? - Yes. He's asking if we want to appeal. Councillors play golf and drink with the judges and the prosecutors. We may call ourselves a democracy but it's really about connections. Through blood, school and birthplace. We have Detective Kim on our side. They didn't post a settlement deposit. With Koo's power his son could've gotten away with a probation. Did he propose a settlement? I'm not going to settle. Get yourself a private investigator. If she's an illegal immigrant she won't answer calls from unknown numbers. Let me see that. Give me that. Your legal fee's due in a week. What? Yes, hello? Hello there. I'm Attorney Hwang Woo-sik. I got a call from Immigrations. I'm sure she has her papers. Is your wife's name Choi... Choi... Choi... Lee Su-ryun? Is that so? Do you happen to know Choi Ryeon-hwa? They are cousins? Hello... h-h-hello? He hung up on me. Stop biting your nails, it'll bleed. The number you're trying to reach is unavailable. He said Taebaek Chicken Farm. I got what you wanted. What's wrong? Your approval rating rises even after that hit-and-run. You can't drop out of the race. Did you come here just to tell me that? Don't flatter yourself. I'm just bored, that's why I've been paying you a bit of attention. If you're in the mood to be attending Mass that means the worst is over. Enter the election. Pardon me? You met Councillor Kim at the airport. He'll head the committee. Take some photos and introduce him. Come on now. Continue opposing the issue. Kim will support it. I need you to maintain the equilibrium. That business is for the VIP. It isn't mine. Why me? You have that quality about you. A sense of theatrics. What matters isn't what people believe in but rather, what you can make them believe. Do it. You are Jesus. Plenty of people will see wine when you pour water. It was just a hit-and-run. Tie up all the loose ends. I'll recommend you for the election. Busan Metropolitan City Lions Club 2nd floor. - Hey! - Looking for GPS signal. Starting turn-by-turn navigation. Drive safely. Continue down this street. Incoming call: Unknown number Hello? Who is it? Good day. Are you Ms Lee Su-ryun? I'm Ryeon-hwa's father-in-law. Did you come to Korea from Harbin together? It's Yanbian. What? Men here prefer Harbin girls to Yanbian girls. Same difference though. Go away. I don't know her anymore. Aren't you her cousin? (Mandarin) Second wife. What? You know, mistress. From the same womb but different seeds. Well... Ryeon-hwa is missing. Is any of your other family members here? Did you do something to her? If not, she won't come back. We're in-laws. Aren't you even worried that your sister is missing? Why should I worry about someone who did this to me? Honey, let's eat. Back in Yanbian, we have a saying. "Better to be a cow than a woman". She's the daughter of a mistress. She has already got it bad. A rejected child has to buy herself a name and status. To get here and to survive we did unspeakable things. My face... She did this out of jealousy because I found a husband first. If you try to hurt her even a little she'll pay you back for it, no matter what. Don't look for her. No good will come from having her around. She's rotten inside. That cursed wench. Crap. Text from unknown number Incoming call: Unknown number Have you found Choi Ryeon-hwa? Do you have her? Why put up a missing person flyer if you won't answer the phone? Who are you? Never mind that. Just send me $20,000. You're not the only one looking for her. What? You need to find her before someone takes her. What happened? - Same thing with your shop? - Yeah. I think the whole building blacked out. Where are you going? Let's have some fun together, handsome. We're closed. I called so long ago. Why haven't you left yet? Sir. Is she here? - Hey! - What? Some guy cut off power to the whole building. Yeah! Apple wasn't feeling well so she went home early. She's not home yet? (Mandarin) Are you Kim, the debt collector? Choi from the massage parlour? Don't kill me. I only held him down. Su-ryun was the one who slit his throat. That witch killed him. Is Su-ryun dead? Please. Don't kill me. I beg you. Father? Is that you? I'm sorry. After I lost Bu-nam I looked for him all night. I was so scared. Who are you? Who sent you? What did you do to my eyes? Please... Don't kill me. I beg you. Don't kill me. Don't kill me. Live a good life. OK. Will you let me go? So savage. You even brought tools. It's an honour to meet you, Councillor. I thought privacy is paramount to you. Of course. Or I would've have blabbed about you. So, the blackout wasn't a coincidence. Take it as a favour to you, sir. Want a cigarette? If I've offended you, I apologise. You have money and power. I wonder why you're doing this. It has to be one of the two. No one to trust or can't trust anyone. What do you want? What do I want? How did you find her? It's a trade secret. The flash drive you gave me. Habit is a scary thing. She bought and shipped something in Busan from one of her favourite shopping sites. What did you put over her eyes? Watch out, girl! Hey... Come on. What should I do? Want some help? Want me to finish her off? You just have to say the word, Councillor. Should I kill her? Yes. Thank you. Yong-gu. Yes? Looks like an accident. Stop... stop! What are you doing at this hour? This sports drink is good for replenishing your amniotic fluids. Drink one big bottle a day. Here. How did you find me? Here. I paid $20,000 for this photo. But if it weren't for this I wouldn't have found you. Drink it. You should've come to me. I couldn't find him even in the morning. I looked everywhere but he was gone. I thought something bad must have happened. I was scared. I'm sorry, Father. You couldn't have found him. His body was found in the drain. No, I looked even in the forest. There was no sign of him anywhere. Father, will I be taken away? I can't get deported. They'll review your case. I talked to the police, so don't worry. You searched the drains too? Bu-nam liked leaves. I searched the drains, all the way to the beach. What? What's this? The leg was visible on 8th October... but not on the 7th. The hit-and-run took place on the 6th. It would make sense if the leg could be seen on the 7th but not the 8th. But how could a dead man have stuck his leg out of the drain? A dead man? This is... murder. Koo's family are all in on it. How did I miss this? Did she see them take Bu-nam away? If she did, would she have run away? That's true. "That's true"? That's all you can say? Incompetent cop! - One second, sir! - Hey! Incompetent? - I've had it with you! - Hey! Enough. Please, calm down. He bled a lot. If we get a search warrant we should find traces of blood in Koo's car and at his house. There was no blood in his car. What about his house? It's under renovation. Lights, please. Forensics technology is so advanced these days yet they didn't find a single drop of blood? That's odd. Let's find out. Find out what? From who? Dang it! Father? What the heck... Darn. Father? Hello there. It's OK... Sit down. It's OK, please sit. I'm his lawyer, Hwang Woo-sik... Now I understand why your father put you here. We found a witness. My daughter-in-law, Ryeon-hwa was at the scene. She saw you put Bu-nam in the car. Yes... She did. She saw it. There's a truck that drives by that road every day. Bu-nam wasn't caught on the dashboard camera of that truck. Because you took him alive and he died so you put him back, right? If you took him to the ER, he could've lived. You killed him. That's... illegal... Disposal of a body. Illegal disposal of a body! Yeah, that. You killed Bu-nam in a hit-and run. You're going to be in here for good. You can get the death penalty for that. Yeah. That's right. The death penalty. Did you do it? Or did you do it with your parents? Hey! Tell me. - Could you get my father? - What? Get my father. Listen to this punk. Is this a hotel? - Are you on a trip? - Please. Just get my father, please. Wait! Please! How could you arrest a pregnant woman? Since when did Korea become so heartless? Come on. The situation is bad! Make way! Move... move! What are you doing here? Hey, give me her file! Choi Ryeon-hwa has two outstanding charges. Yeah. Did you press charges against me? Yeah. I did it to find you but don't worry. My lawyer said you can come back after your deportation. No! I have to go to jail. If I stay here, I'll be deported in two weeks. Did you drop the charges? So I won't be going to jail? Of course. You're pregnant. Get deported first then with proper paperwork... Bloody hell! Ryeon-hwa? Ryeon-hwa! What? - In order to come to Korea... - Yeah? I had to kill someone. He was trash. He deserved what he got. Father. - Dad. - Yes? You have to save Bu-nam's baby. OK? You promise? It's jail, not home. Why would she want to go there? With her charges dropped the cops aren't interested in her anymore. We have more important things to worry about. Johan... attempted suicide. He slashed himself here... with a pencil. It must have been something you said. They tampered with the body but the police couldn't find any traces of blood. That makes no sense to me. Either they have someone on the inside or they swapped cars. So I looked into his car. He had it totalled. But... he has two cars. Johan claimed the car he drove that night was the Grandeur which belongs to Koo's wife. Koo also has a BMW under his name. But he totalled the BMW before Johan turned himself in. Which means they swapped cars. As for Ryeon-hwa's kidnapping... But we have no proof. Says who? We do. Koo's BMW was in good shape so the mechanics sold it overseas. Where is this? Pakistan. Come on now. It's just a plane ride away. Wait a minute. We'll go there and bring the evidence back. The reporters... What's the address of the person who pressed charges against Ryeon-hwa? Right. Oh Seok-hee, city of Wegwan. I'll get Bu-nam's case reopened for concealment of evidence. It's time we make good use of the media. He's insane. A murderer running in the election? What a joke! Let's go. Wegwan. Oh Seok-hee... Honey. Go get some rest. Anyone home? Hello? Are you here to see the house? An old bachelor called Oh lived here. He had a limp but he must've been quite capable since he married a young girl. You idiot. What's so capable about that? He married an illegal immigrant. She left him because he didn't get their marriage registered. She got tired of waiting. He called the police and looked everywhere for her. He drank himself to oblivion and wailed about how he couldn't live without her. Then one day, he came to us all jubilant saying he found her but I guess he didn't see her. That's him, Oh Seok-hee. He walked with a limp. Where is he now? He's dead. What? Six feet under. That idiot got drunk and jumped off a cliff. No way, don't be silly. He wasn't the sort to kill himself. It's more likely that he was murdered. He was going around asking about where to get dental implants. Why get dental implants if he was going to off himself? She ran away? They're quite similar in age and size. Don't look for her. She's rotten inside. That cursed wench. Hello? Good evening. I'm Ryeon-hwa's father-in-law. I have something to ask you. Hello? Hello? Wegwan Station Why did you come to me now? I was told to aim for the neck of the most powerful man in our country. I won't know anything until then. I have one condition. Don't let my daughter-in-law get deported. Murderer! He's a murderer! Don't settle! You can't settle, sir! Mr Yoo! Hey! You bloody fool! What's with him? We just have to go to Pakistan! I have one condition too. Come on! Tuck in. This is a fifty-dollar lunch. What? We're working to stop your deportation. Don't worry. How? You don't need to know. Tell my father-in-law I'll get him his $20,000 back. - $20,000? - Yes. He will be thrilled, yeah? Right? Bu-nam... Bu-nam. My baby! I stand here today seeking everyone's forgiveness and understanding. I have a guest with me today who epitomises the spirit of forgiveness. Gyeongnam Province Governorship Election I forgot my notes. I forgot to bring my speech. Hello. I'm Yoo Joong-sik. The reason I'm here before you... I... actually... Yes. I used to give my son handjobs. I mean... I masturbated him myself. I first started doing it when he was about 13. He didn't know how to relieve the urge and he would hurt himself... trying to do it. Until he bled. When I did it for him... his moans pierced my ears. Back then... I found it inconceivably unbearable. But when I think about it now... You can use this. I wish... I had continued to do it until the day I die. Had I done that, my son... Yes. He wouldn't have met Councillor Koo under such unfortunate circumstances. I lost my son recently. The reason I'm here today is to support the man whose son killed my son. His honesty and sincerity in seeking forgiveness melted my rage. That's why I volunteered to assist Councillor Koo in his governorship campaign. And here I am today. I... I support him! I support his honesty and integrity! Koo Myung-hui... Koo Myung-hui! Ryeon-hwa. - Ryeon-hwa! - Yes? Bye, Ryeon-hwa. Take care. Take care of yourselves. Koo Myung-hui? Who is he? Are you hungry? Let's go eat. Heartbeat's normal. She's malnourished and her uterus is weak. She needs to take extra care. OK. OK. Are there any private rooms? The waiting list is about two to three weeks. Let's go home, Father. There's a chance of premature labour. Stay here until you give birth. The lawyer told me... I'm a better candidate than a total stranger for this. Marriage Certificate Husband: Yoo Joong-sik Wife: Choi Ryeon-hwa It's just a formality, so don't you worry. Father! Father! I'll do my best! Please trust me. - I'll do my best. - Get changed. Go on. Get changed. Don't cry. It's not good for you. OK. Why are you here? Leave. - Don't say that. - Come back another day. - She needs rest. - Just for a while. - Go away! - Just for a bit. Wow! My goodness! Boss? Ryeon-hwa! Ryeon-hwa! How are you? Yeah, I'm OK. - That's good. - I was so worried. Ryeon-hwa! Ryeon-hwa! - Ryeon-hwa! - Yes? - I'm late. - Mr Yoo. - Welcome. - Thank you. I brought my daughter-in-law with me. - Hello. - Hi. Good to meet you. Thank you, Councillor. My father-in-law told me so much about you. He's been helping me quite a bit. Nice to meet you. Here. Thank you. Please take a seat. Over there, please. - Welcome. - Hi. Sir, which cologne do you use? Pardon me? It's smells familiar. I think it's because I'm pregnant. I'm a lot more sensitive to scents. Is my aftershave too strong? So it's an aftershave. Hey. You said you're hungry. Dig in. - You're hungry, aren't you? - Yes. Are you about six months along? Yes. It's a difficult period, right? When I had my child, the morning sickness... Where in Yanbian? I'm from Harbin, not Yanbian. I recognise your accent. We lived in China for a while because of his business. (Mandarin) Eat... Mother, she's a Korean citizen now. I see. Councillor, they'd like a photo with you. Tell them to wait a bit. - Mr Yoo. - Yes? - Could I borrow you for a moment? - Sure. - We'll be right back. - Sure thing. Eat slowly. Harbin folks don't care for Yanbian folks. Is that so? Makes sense. They like to lie and say they're from Harbin. Who stuck their gum here? My goodness. There's a clock on the photo. Can you pass me the phone number of the client who made an appointment for that time slot? That blouse doesn't fit. I need to return it. - Yeah. - I don't believe this. It was about four days before I was kidnapped. Yeah. So what? They're just rotten swindlers and slanderers. Call me. Hey, lady. Granny. Where do you live? Why do you ask? You know what? Words cut deeper than knives do and those wounds never heal. Tell me. Why? - Are you going to come visit? - Are you deaf? Watch your mouth. Candidate number one, Koo Myung-hui! Vote for him, please! Candidate number one, Koo Myung-hui! Mr Yoo! Hello! Candidate number one, Koo Myung-hui! Candidate number one, Koo Myung-hui! 3348-4982. Weren't you kidnapped in a Korando SUV? Yeah? I think the man who caused the blackout is the same dude who took the picture of you. What do you mean? He drove a Korando SUV too. I thought it was fishy so I got a cop friend to look it up. That dude used to be a cop. He's a private investigator now. His name is... Kim Yong-gu. Got it. Thank you. Ryeon-hwa, will you stay a while? I need to run to the bank. OK, go ahead. That john who just went in wants you to serve him. Pervert. He knows I'm pregnant. Ryeon-hwa, it's just for an hour. He doesn't want any essential oils. I'll be right back. Kim Yong-gu... CEO Kim Yong-gu Seriously? - Come on! - Couldn't you blur it at least? I'm a busy man. Her head's gone. The killer staged it to look like a murder-suicide. We got tonnes of fingerprints. - Do something. - But no matches. Open the door. I just need you to verify something. No way! This is bad luck. I've only met them once. - I know nothing! - You talked to the killer! I did? The killer took Lee Su-ryun's phone and you're the last caller according to the call log. This is Wegwan City. 28th October, 11.00pm at the station. I think it's in that box. The head, Lee Su-ryun's head. Have you seen him or met him anywhere? Would you like some tea? I'll start the massage. Happy ending. What? Happy ending. It's $50 for a handjob. Do you want it? Am I nervous? What? (Mandarin) I'm not getting hard. You speak Korean like a native now. Do you know me? I know... who that empty box is meant for. Continue. I was going to wait for you to get deported. But your father-in-law is a resourceful man. I know everything. If I had a father like him maybe my life would've been different. Incoming call: Father Yes, hello? He hung up. Hey. - They're doing it in there. - What? I can hear them going at it. We don't offer that kind of service. Come on. You can hear them moaning. This is unfair. This is just wrong. Ryeon-hwa? Mr Yoo! Sir, you can't go in there! Stop! Wait, please. What are you doing? Go. Bu-nam couldn't have kids? You knew it wasn't his baby. Why didn't you say anything? Were you lonely? I'll keep my promise. It's the truth. I mean it. I had... his tubes cut... Gyeongnam Province Governorship Election Koo Myung-hui: 29.1% Kkam! Come eat! Kkam, come eat! Kkam, come eat! Kkam, come eat! Kkam! - Come eat! - Bu-nam. You're taller. Change the light bulb. Hey. Quiet. I'm recording. Kkam, come eat! Kkam, come eat! Done? I'm recording now. An explosion occurred here at 11.00pm tonight. Admiral Yi Sun-sin's head was greatly damaged in the explosion. No one was injured but the police have not ruled out the possibility of more bombings. Terror suspect Yoo was arrested on site by the police. The police will be looking into his motive for this act of terror. He laughed. Yi's head fell onto Gwanghwamun Square. He did. People are gathering at the square to mourn the destruction of Admiral Sun's statue. I heard that scum is Koo's campaign leader. Yoo worked as an air conditioner repairman for more than 24 years. He was familiar with electronic devices and made the bomb himself. The terror suspect had recently registered marriage to his late son's wife who was a Chinese national. Do you have a contingency plan? We poured so much into this election! Honey. Ryeon-hwa... is here in our house. She wants you to come. Can you get here quick? Hello? Where are you? Is that old man senile? So... it was cologne after all. He lied to my face. Ryeon-hwa... I have to get $20,000 from Yongho Services but he's missing. Did you know that? What? Live a good life. Mister. Did your father-in-law put you up to this? I guess he didn't tell you. What are you doing? Killing a person over a mere $20,000? Oh, that's right. He only paid $10,000 to have me killed. Don't do this, Ryeon-hwa. Not you too... Think about your father-in-law, please? You knew I was here but you sent your mother over anyway. You wanted her to die? No wonder I found you familiar. It's not just your cologne. You're rotten inside. All right. What? Maybe you'll save your woman. Don't do that! Don't! I'll give you money. All the money you want! I knew you'd wimp out. You friggin' dirtbag. They're calling it an act of terror. It's worse than... hundreds of people dead. Did you do it for revenge? Mr Yoo. Did you get Ryeon-hwa to kill them? I have people asking me why I don't go for reconstructive surgery when I can clearly afford to. I didn't know. I had a bad illness... but it didn't hurt.
