- [GIGGLING] - [ALARM RINGING] What happened? Why are you laughing? Then what should I do other than laughing? Everyday you keep an alarm to wake you up... ...but you get up before the alarm rings. It looks like that this doesn't wake you up... ...but you wake the alarm. My dear, better half! I value time very much. The one who doesn't value time, time doesn't value him. Has Ravi woken up? Are you feeling well? I am perfectly alright. But why!? I mean, you've never before asked about home affairs... ...today suddenly you're enquiring... ...whether Ravi has woken. I find it strange, right. It's not like that. What do you think? That I don't think about you. Yes I do, in my heart. But I have no time to speak out the feelings of my heart. What are you doing? Going out without having a bath? Today, I don't have time even to have a bath. It's like this that work is going on the bank of the river. I will get the work started and also have a dip in the river. It's said that it's healthy to swim early morning in the river. Hey! You've started taking care of your health as well!? Listen! Daily before leaving the house you tell me something. Won't you say it today? What do I say? Tell me quickly, What is it that I say? I have no time to waste. Hey! Were you a clock in your last birth!? You speak only about time whenever you speak. We get time only in the morning to talk. Today you forgot that too. You always tell me where to send the breakfast and... ...where to send your lunch. Okay, send my breakfast to the riverside... ...along with a set of clothes to change. Send the lunch to Panchayat's office. Okay. Dinner!? Dinner with wife. Hey! What are you doing here? I am making a cup of hot tea for my Sister-in-law. - Move I'll make it. - I drink the tea made by Sister-in-law everyday... ...one day you have tea made by your brother-in-law. Okay, tell me why are you so happy today? What can I say? Today I saw my brother and his wife... ...talking lovingly to each other. We were talking about you only. Hey! You were talking lovingly about me... ...am I a thing to spoken about? Stop talking nonsense. Tell me what is your idea to do further. Sister-in-law, let the results come first. Yes, after the results only. See Sister-in-law, I'll fulfill whatever you and brother desire. - What is this!? - Exactly. For me, orders from you both are like orders of God. My Sister-in-law's wishes are like Goddess Laxmi's blessings. My destiny is written By the two of you... ...then where is the question of my decision. But Sister-in-law, when I lose my temper I lose my head. Temper! Losing temper for what!? My brother, he is busy with social service. He is so busy in bringing happiness in others' life... ...that by the time he is back home he is tired... ...to give happiness to my Sister-in-law. And I'm not happy with this. No, no. Who said he is not caring to me? Will there be a luckier women than me in this world? I've a younger brother-in-law like Lakshman,... ...husband like Ram and a house like heaven To me, my world is more beautiful than heaven. Ravi. Ravi! Hey Ravi! Yes brother! What happened? After so many years you have fulfilled my wishes. You have fulfilled my dreams of my life. You have passed, my dear, you have passed. Like I have passed in the exam of my life... ...and the exam of keeping my promise to father. On this occasion I have a gift for you. Come on, come. [FOOTSTEPS] You are great brother! Hey! You! Hey! You! - Shut up! - [COW MOO] This is my shop not a mental hospital for dogs. You are shouting as if you all have consumed castor oil! Go and make a queue. Come, come. C'mon, make a queue like soldiers. Come on. What do you want? One kilo sugar. Mewalal, Who is this dumb, who wants sugar? In the whole nation there is no sugar. Now in these times, people talk sweet and drink hot water... ...and enjoy the taste of tea. - What are you eating? - Banana. - Is it your father's? - But Milawat Ram. The government has sent you... ...our share of sugar also. Is it? Call your government, I'll ask them, when did they sent? The stock of sugar they've sent has finished last Diwali itself. Milawat Ram, everybody knows that... ...our share of sugar stock is in your house. Yes it is there in my house. But that is mine and not for freeloaders. But my child is not drinking milk without sugar. I mean, give sugar from your house stock. If you want sugar from my house, then you'll have to show permit for Rs. 10/-. - It means... - It means Rs. 10/- per kilo. Okay. It's my helplessness! Not helplessness. It is essential. That too in this bitter age you are getting sweet sugar. - Mewalal! - Yes! Give one kilo of sugar that's white and sweet. In black price!? - Is it your father's property? - I was drinking the water. When'll my number come? My legs have started aching standing in the scorching sun. Shut up! Legs have started aching. Just think how much our legs ache! When I, the young man and my aged servant go to the town and... ...bring things from there carrying them... ...on our heads for you all. Stop your lecture. Give me 5 kilograms of wheat flour. Here is your permit and twenty rupees. You donkey and an ass! In these twenty rupees you need 5 kilos of wheat flour! You won't get the photo of wheat even. Come on move. Who is next? Okay, Okay. Here are five more rupees. But one day your atrocity is going to come to an end. Yes, yes it'll surely come to an end. - Shut up. What are you saying? - Nothing. You fools! You forgot the saying that... ...you should not make a hole from which you eat. You people have not only eaten my salt... ...but also wheat flour, rice, pulses, so on. Mewalal. Weigh 5 kilo wheat flour for him. Come on, who is next? Give me 1 kilo of gram pulse. Ah! This face and gram pulse. Big leaders haven't got their gram pulses yet... ...then where are you going to get from? Move from here. Boss, she is not the person to stand in the queue. - Why? - She is my relative. - Relative! you were born like an orphan in the drainage. - Is it. You are such an orphan that even the orphanage people refused you. Then how's she your relative? No. No. She is the relative of... ...my distant relative's close relative. When did you know about it? I knew it in the darkness of the night. - So, give her pulses. - Okay. Because my servant recommended, I'm giving you. - Okay, you go and get the pulses. - Okay. [BIKE ENGINE REVVING] Hey! My real beloved in that duplicate's arms! Hey blind! Can't you see? Those are eyes or nuts? Are you driving a vehicle or flying kites? You told me something!? Then what, I told something to your father!? What is this? Instead of filling petrol in the tank have you filled some frogs in it? Don't move, stay like this. I'll tell you later, what's filled in my tank... ...but first you dispose off what is in your lap What's there? You frighten the people and on top of that you argue. - Don't move. - And you stick a young poster on your old age. If your wife comes now, she will bash you and... ...turn you into a poster and paste it on the wall. This poor girl got frightened and fell on my lap. When some one falls on your lap then you can remove them also. Is your lap like a village pond!? Takes hours to remove an animal. Hey! Go from here. [BIKE ENGINE REVVING] Hey Kaleram! You got the fruits of your deeds. - What? - You tried to meddle with my flower... ...and God painted your face black. Hey! May big worms bite you! [BIKE ENGINE REVVING] Hey girl! When God has given you two legs... ...why are you jumping on one leg? Practicing to beg? Shut up! Can't you see! Have you left your eyes behind in the city? No. I have brought my eyes also from the city... ...and I have learnt a new game from there as well. Play with me and see. You'll bubble with joy throughout your life. What game? I can kiss anybody neither by touching them nor by using my hands. Okay, okay, get out of here. I promise on my mother. If I lie, then you face my turn black! Come on, let's take a bet. If I kiss you without touching you, then you give me Rs. 10/- And if I fail, then I will give you a fine of Rs. 100/-. Okay? Why are you hesitating? Have you come from a beggar's family? You don't have ten rupees to bet even? Okay! Okay! Rich man. I bet. That's sportive. Now see my talent. What is this insolence? Pardon me! I kissed you by touching you. I lost my Rs. 100 /- on bet. My day is going to be bad. Hey! I won! I won. What, you won? He has kissed you in the public place. You cheat, shameless fellow! I won't spare you. Hey! You big rotten egg of a duck! Close fast. I'm closing, closing. Why are you screaming? Hey! Tomorrow, it's the naming ceremony of Ramdas's son. I have to do lot of adulteration. Close the shop fast. Closing it. Hey wrestler, I mean wife, come fast. Why are you screaming? Coming. What are you walking like a sack of rice? There aren't so much grains in my shop which are in hers. - What's this? - Groundnut oil. - Groundnut oil. - Yes! - Where is the Til Oil? - There Then mix the groundnut oil in the Til oil. Mix. [SCREAMING] Hey! What are you mixing in this? Stupid, I thought the police came. - Police! - Hey! Speak softly otherwise... ...I'll stuff your throat with a bucket full of gum. But what are you mixing in it? I'm mixing groundnut oil with til oil. If you keep doing adulterations like this Milawat Ram... ...then your business will come to an end one day. Hey! Speak good, fool, speak good. Even when you open your mouth,... ...toilet cleaning powder comes out of it. Don't we mix groundnut oil in til oil! Sack of Rice! What's your name? Yes, Bandarlekha, where is the black sand? It's next to you. Which donkey calls you a black sand? You only call me black sand hundred times in a day. That I say to my fate and not to you. I do adulteration in groceries ... ...and God has done this adulteration in my life. - What did you say? - Oh! I'm asking for black sand to mix in the pulse... ...now should I mix you in the sack of pulses? Where's the black sand? Oh boss! Why are you dying for the black sand? The times have changed. Now instead of mixing the black sand in the sack of pulse,... ...we can mix the pulse in the sack of black sand. Then only there is profit in it. Yes, the last time you have said something intelligent. "Everything is a deceit." "Everything is a deceit." Hey you! I am slogging here and you are shaking your hips! And you! Put off the song. I am doing adulteration here quietly and ... ...you are playing this song so that... ...the whole village comes to know of my adulteration. Oh father! Stop this adulteration. I will give you in writing that this money which ... ...you are earning by adulteration and saving... ...will never come of use to you. God forbid, if you fall sick and the medicine we buy... ...from this money will also be adulterated. Shut up! Bribe and adulteration are the decoration of the world. Moreover has God created a pure human being? With the mixture of air, water, fire and soul only... ...human being was created. If God can do adulteration why shouldn't I? Then who are you to stop me from doing it. Then if that is the matter then why are doing it closing your shop. Keep your shop open and show everybody that you are not... ...doing anything wrong. - You are going on the path of God. - Hey, you... See Bandarlekha, this girl has made my life miserable. Look for a good groom, get her married and send her off. Then only my life will go on peacefully. Oh, Oh! Going on the look out for a groom!? Why have you made a long face? Are you getting married or getting hanged to death!? Why are you getting scared? Priest! Finish the rituals quickly or... ...else the two will faint before it. Both bride and groom stand up. Encircle the fire seven times. - Stop it! - Hey! Who is that? Good, my son. My dearest son! Without caring for father's feelings... ...you are getting married to a girl of your choice. Uncle! You stopped your son from getting married to the girl of his choice. That's why he had to take this step. I am asking you, who are you to come between us. This is my son and he is my property. From the day he came to his mother's womb till date... ...I've spent 1 lakh rupees on him. I want a bride who will bring Rs. 1 lakh as dowry along with her. But this donkey is bringing a girl for free! I beg your pardon uncle! You can't take away Prakash by force from here. This marriage will be performed. It means you are threatening me! I will show you... Kalu, Billu, Ranga, Jaggu, Moti! Sqeeze like you squeeze a wet cloth. Hey! Not me, him, that stupid. Go! - Hey! Come. And why are you coming with him? - Father. Come on. Hey! Where are you all running!? Come on. Come with me. Listen to me... My dear uncle! Before your nephew raises his hand on you... ...that is before I smash your face, better leave this place. Ravi! What misbehavior is this? Sorry Brother! I was behaving politely. But when he started misbehaving I had to do the same. First tell me, what happened? Brother, Pannalal's son, Prakash is in love with Dulari. They want to get married. But this fellow has a desire for dowry. Oh God! Even in this day there are people... ...who are willing to trade their children. - Dulari! - Yes. Have you taken your parents' permission and blessings? Yes. Then, Prakash from what is happening here it seems... ...you haven't cared to take your father's permission. Yes brother! It's true. Because I don't want to be auctioned... ...like cows, buffaloes in the market of dowry. I am in deep love with Dulari... ...and I want to make her as mine for the life time. Okay! It's alright. Me, being the chief of the village... ...give the permission to perform this wedding. Ravi! Arrange for their wedding rituals. Don't forget, that till last year I was the chief of this village. I have never given any one sided judgement. Do listen! This judgment will prove to be very costly for you. I will see to you! I won't spare you! [JEEP ENGINE REVVING] [CRICKET CHIRPING] Serve the food fast. [MILK POURING] [SIGHS] What? Mosquito! [GIGGLING] "Our house is more beautiful than paradise!" "Our house is more beautiful than paradise!" "From where have the mosquitoes entered our paradise?" "From where have the mosquitoes entered our paradise?" "Even the mosquitoes are crazy about you, what should I do!" "What should I do!? What should I do?" "Our house is more beautiful than paradise!" - "The bed is biting me. - Is it?" "The bed is biting me." "Even the bed is crazy about you, what to do?" "What to do!? What to do?" "Our house is more beautiful than paradise!" "The nights before the wedding!" "You seem to have forgotten everything!" "The nights before the wedding!" "You seem to have forgotten everything!" "New love and new youth. New love and new youth." "New love and new youth. New love and new youth." "Now everything has gone old." "Now everything has gone old." "I still remember those days, what to do?" "What to do!? What to do?" "What to do!?" "Our house is more beautiful than the paradise!" "No... No." "This anger in love is good. But why is this pillow in between?" "This anger in love is good. But why is this pillow in between?" "There is so much to talk and the night is short." "Who made such a pair?" "I am like a glass and you are such a stone! What to do?" "What to do!? What to do?" "What to do!?" "Our house is more beautiful than paradise!" "Whatever happens let it happen." "Whatever happens let it happen." "Let me sleep for sometime." "The sleep came as soon as you are home."

"Even the mosquitoes are crazy about you, what to do!" "What to do!?" "What to do!? What to do?" "Our house is more beautiful than paradise!" Mr. Milawat! Give me unadulterated milk powder. Unadulterated milk powder! You are abusing me. You mean to say that I adulterate? Even cow won't give such pure milk like the one I give. I give means I sell. Give me Rs. 10/- But yesterday my neighbor took it for Rs. 8/-. Come give me Rs. 20/-. People behind you may just die of waiting. Okay. I have Rs. 10 /- and take it. Hey! What are you doing? - Cleaning. - Where is the pure milk? - I will have to search for it. - Fine search for it quickly. - Okay. If your son drinks my milk, he will grow tall like a camel. If he drinks for 6 months continuously... ...he will stand to be 60 yrs old, like me. - Here. - Got it. Bring it quick. - This is the pure milk. - Wait. Milawat Ram! Like your name, there is adulteration in your products also. How did this milk come here? This is given free in the hospitals. How can you sell it? That too after adulterating it. See, this child has fallen sick after drinking milk from your shop. This milk is not from my shop. Must have bought it from somewhere else. Milawat Ram! There is no shop in neighboring villages... ...other than this village. Yes, there is no other shop. But I don't adulterate. These people have needlessly named me as Milawat Ram. I swear on God. I've never done any adulteration till date. Good! Come to the police station. Police station!? No, no, don't take me to the police station. Initially, my father-in-law was a police constable... ...then I used to go to the police station. After his demise I've never been to the police station. Don't take me to the police station. Mr. Milawat Ram. Owe up your guilt here itself. Otherwise they'll take you to your in-laws house. Yes! Sometimes adulteration takes place by mistake. Black marketing also! Mewalal! All the reports are correct. I've also heard that you weigh less by tilting the weigh balance. What to do, sir? I am an employee. I've to do what the boss says. Boss says to weigh 1 kg if someone asks for 2kgs of rice. I am the friend of the poor. I give them 1 and 1/2 kgs. The boss also doesn't come to know. You Idiot! Cheat! That's why I think why... ...the groceries are becoming less and also the cash collections. You Idiot! You cheat! Stop this drama, Milawat Ram! Despite giving warnings time and again... ...you still haven't stopped your acts. Okay, now it will not be like that... The village counsel will take a decision about you. Come, let's go! - Greetings. - Greetings. Very soon, we should open a cooperative shop in our village... ...which will put an end to adulteration and black market. But Mr. Vijay, how is Panchayat benefited by opening of a cooperative shop? But this village is benefited, Mr. Ramlakhan. The villagers will not get adulterated items. Further, shopkeepers sell the things at different prices suiting their pocket. Our cooperative shop will sell things at a fixed price. We will get good things... ...without any type of adulteration and the would be pure. But dear Vijay! Why explain? Whatever decision you take is for the welfare of the village only. Rahim uncle is correct. You just give orders. - To obey it is our duty. - It is our duty. Thank you very much. From today our objective is... ...to open a cooperative shop and put an end to black market. I'll put a lock in his life. I'll roast him with bullets like people roast papads. You are telling the truth, isn't it, brother-in-law? I am, but there is a problem. I am a follower of non -violence. I follow the path of Gandhiji. Otherwise I would've grinded the villagers like wheat flour. Dear Pal! Why don't you do something? - You are the worshipper of violence. A goon, A rowdy... - What!? No. I meant that you love fighting. It is your profession. Moreover, they insulted you more than me. Brother, the way they went round the fire 7 times... ...there has been a volcano bursting in me. Then do something fast before it cools down. I am ready to pour pure ghee in it, that too for free. Ghee won't do, brother. Take out some money. You hand over some money to me so that... ...I'll stop them from opening the shop. [TRACTOR ENGINE REVVING] [CLANKING CHAINS] [BIKE ENGINE REVVING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [GROANING] Hey get up you blots on India! Yes! You bravo! Get up! Good. Want to fight? Hold your ears, become a cock! Turn around. Go forward. By making the sound! Ready? 1... 2... [COUGHS] [SNEEZING] [DRUM PLAYING] Listen! Villagers, listen! Good news for you! Tomorrow, Saturday,... ...in front of the Durga temple, a cooperative shop... ...is being opened, where you will... ...get everything pure and reasonably priced. There's an invitation for all of you to come. Sure, sure. Who'll not come for such a good deed? What did you say, cheater? From tomorrow black marketers will go bankrupt! And those who adulterate will have black paint on their face! May your mother's husband have black paint on his face. Get lost. Don't go. Firstly by opening the cooperative shop you are... ...hampering his business and turning him to become a beggar. Secondly, by beating the drums, you are increasing... ...the fire in his heart by adding ghee to it. So what? I'll shout for the welfare of the village. Village will be benefited but his business will be washed away! Why are you shouting here and making him wet his bottoms!? - Shut up! - Hey! I am beating the drums for his sake only. Hey drumbeater! What harm will you do to me? Why not? When you die nobody will come for your funeral... ...but I'll surely come to beat the drums. Hey you two penny worth drumbeater! What you have thought boss to be such a small hearted fellow? Such a cheap, despicable, fellow,... ...an idiot, a mad and stray dog? Hey! With how many names are you abusing me? I'm not abusing you, boss, I am pleading for you. Hey drumbeater! Wait for my boss to die. Then why this drum? I'll call for the band party from the city. I'll make the whole village dance,... ...I'll take out such a procession that... ...the whole nation will keep looking and think that's... ...the death of a boss? How did you like it, boss? [GIGGLING] You're praying for my death. On top of that you're asking for my praise. You go inside. I'll come and take care of you. And you! You will beat drums for me, is it? Will you play the drums, you Idiot. - 'Madhavpur Supermarket' - [APPLAUSE] - Hey! Hey! - Get up. Shut up! Brothers and sisters, there are many reasons... ...for the opening of this cooperative shop in our village. The main reason is to put an end to ... ...adulterations and black market happening in some shops. Wait dear, you're accusing that some people are doing... ...adulterations and black market. Tell me, won't it happen in the cooperative shop? I'll give a reply to this. C'mon give. Adulteration is done by people who have an adulterated nature,... ...adulterated intentions and have... ...the word 'adulterated' attached with their name... ...like you Milawat Ram, who does the adulterations. He has directly splashed mud on your face and blackened it. Shut up. Who has seen me doing the adulterations? - I have seen it. - Shut up! Yes, who has seen doing the shop... ...I mean doing adulterations? What's the need to see? Even if you ask a blind man where the adulteration is done, he'll take you straight to Milawat Ram's shop. Oh God! The whole village, the whole country knows that... ...Milawat Ram's shop is the godown for adulteration. See! You are going beyond the limits. Going beyond the limits what!? If it is within my hand... ...I shall cut your plait and send you to the cellular jail. Cut my plait, why won't you? Your brother spoiled my business and you send me out of the village. - Is it your father's rule!? - Hey! Milawat Ram! Hey Ravi! What misbehavior is this? Do you treat elders like this? He is elder in what way, brother? He is elder in dishonesty. I don't want unnecessary arguments. Go away from here. I asked you to go from here. - Idiot! - Your father is a idiot! Mr. Milawat Ram, I ask your forgiveness on behalf of Ravi. - Forgiven! - What!? On your behalf. Now I'll request sister Laxmi to inaugurate... ...and start the business. You all stand in a queue. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Having spoiled our business, they are now rubbing salt on our wounds! See! How I'll tear you heart into pieces. What do you want, sister? - One kilo of sugar. - Okay. Hey! What is happening!? The shop which is inaugurated ... ...by this cursed woman will never run profitably. She is sterile! A sterile woman has opened the shop. It is a curse! Shame! Shame! Laxmi. Laxmi! What is this? You are feeling sad about what a foolish and illiterate woman said? Shedding tears for her words? You are a literate woman. If you start feeling sad on these small things... ...then your life will also shrink. These people say bad even about the God who creates this world. Why pay attention? Come on wipe tears and smile. Hey! Are you sleeping? If our business is down, what shall I do by being awake? You idiot! You have kept your leg crossed to top it you are shaking it. It's my leg. Whether I shake it or dance, what's your problem? And if I don't shake it, they'll think I've died... ...and dump me in the graveyard. The way people are waiting for us to die. There is a queue. The enemy's shop is so flourishing... ...and my shop is barren like a graveyard. Hey! Look at that shop. Wow! Such a huge crowd. Such a huge crowd doesn't accumulate in our shop in the whole month even. Wow, it seems there's fair being held there. Even people from other villages must have come. Why not? When the goods are cheap and genuine then... ...there's bound to be a huge crowd. What's the use in repenting now when the bird... ...of adulteration, pecked the whole farm. You ungrateful idiot! I'm your boss. Don't you feel ashamed to sing a song on your boss's downfall? What boss? The business has closed down... ...there aren't even flies to drive away and you're claiming to be the boss!? Have your customers left you because... ...of my shaking leg or your adulteration? Speak as you will, dear. When the time is bad... ...a man even fears a dead dog. You're at least a live dog. Look there! Look there! That man is hurriedly coming towards our shop. After so many days, someone has come. After so many days, we've roped in a customer. - Get up. - Welcome, sir. Welcome. Come in. Come in. Don't go to his shop, brother. Come what may, don't go there. Brother, please buy something. We haven't eaten for the past 2 days. Look, my stomach is empty. - Matches, matches. - Matches. Matches. You want to light a cigarette? Everything in our shop is cheaply priced. - Tamarind. - Rs.2 - Pulses. - Rs.3.50/- - Pulse. - 1.50/- - Wheat. - Cheap. - Jaggery. - It's for free. - Keep this. - You can pay the money later. Buy anything you want. You can pay later. Gram seeds? Hey, buy something! He came, asked, and went away. That freeloader! If this prevails, then we've to close our shop... ...and go to beg in another village. Because they wont even give us alms here. And listen, sir. This ornament that you're wearing... ...the time has come to pawn it. Ok, tell me, is this gold real or this is adulterated too? You shut up. Else I'll punch your face and change it into a doormat. Look here, sir. Mind your words. You don't pay the salary, yet you boss over me!? Today, you're the boss. But your condition says that... ...in a few days, you'll become a debtor, then a servant. What's for me? I was a servant, I'm a servant, I'll be a servant. For me, there are 50 doors still open. But for you, your own door has closed. If not you, then someone else. I don't need your job. Hey, cooperative shop owner. You needed a packer, isn't it? I'm coming. No! no! I was just kidding. Sit down, sir. You got angry? Take this. Welcome, Laxmi sister. We were waiting for you. Forgive me. I had some work in my house. That's why I got late. Ok. So, all these foolish women of... ...the village were waiting for this woman? Look, mother. This is what's called the lady of a rich family. She has brought a gold chain as a gift for the child. And you're the one who came empty handed. Who said I came without anything. Look. Such a scary toy. I feel scared looking at it. Don't know what will happen to the child! You keep quiet. Radha! The price of the gift isn't valued. Instead, the intentions of the giver are valued. This gift is lucky for the child. Because I'm giving it from my lucky hands. I've given birth to a child. I'm a mother. If a sterile woman gives gold, silver, diamond, pearls as a gift to the child. It's unlucky for the child. Mother! Why are you saying such things on a festive occasion? A woman who hasn't given birth a child after 5 years of marriage... ...what else is she other than infertile? Mother! For God's sake, keep quiet. Don't say such nasty things. I will not only say it once, but a thousand times. Infertile! Infertile! Infertile! [BIKE ENGINE REVVING] I'm dead! I'm dead! Along with the bones, even my spine's broken. I'm dying at such a young age. O God, open the gates of heaven. I'm coming. What has happened? I was just kidding. It has backfired. Ravi! Ravi, I'm feeling scared. Ravi, is your heart beating? Ravi, open your eyes. Ravi! [GIGGLING] - Were you trying to scare me? - Yes. You idiot, you cheat. Io won't spare you. "Remember that day!" "Remember that day!" "Remember that day!" "Remember that day!" "When by looking at me..." "When by looking at me..." "...your heart swayed!" "That... was a lie, I told." "That... was a lie, I told." "Remember that day!" "Remember that day!" "That you have fallen for me you yourself had opened this secret." "That... was a lie, I told." "That... was a lie, I told." "Will give my heart to anyone, but not to you!" "Will give my heart to anyone, but not to you!" "Forget the heart, I don't want to take your name even." "It got extinguished the fire of my love!" "That... was a lie, I told." "That... was a lie, I told." "I and love you?" "I and love you? Don't be under this false impression?" "What? What?" "I didn't hear it properly, just say it again." "Why did you weigh my love in the balance of your eyes?" "That... was a lie, I told." "That... was a lie, I told." "You considered a lie to be the truth, that's your own fault." "You considered a lie to be the truth, that's your own fault." "Forgot it, just like a story. It withered away, just like a dream!" "In the dreams, we remained awake one day..." "...and you had removed the veil!" "That... was a lie, I told." "That... was a lie, I told." "Remember that day!" "Remember that day!" "That you have fallen for me..." "...you yourself had opened this secret." "That... was a..." "That... was a truth... I had spoken." "Even I had spoken the truth." "That... was a truth, I had spoken." "Even I had spoken the truth." What!? Lalita!? O God! Lalita and that bastard!? Are you listening? Yes, I am. I'm not deaf. Brother, you're not only deaf but dumb too. - You're gutless, spineless, meaning you're totally useless... - Shut up! I can't listen to abuses from a man who has been beaten. Even your time has come to get the blows, brother. Those scoundrels forcefully got my son married. They closed down your business. Now that idiot Ravi is luring, your daughter, Lalita into an affair. It means, our leftover honor will also be... Will also be... will also be... Ceremonially ruined. How many "will also be"!? Yes, ceremonially ruined. You're laughing!? And we're burning like coal due to anger. You keep burning like coal. I'll cook my food over it. And I'll cook such a food that whoever eats it will be dazed. - Mewaram! - Coming, sir. You're my true servant. What a good news you've brought. For this reason, here's a prize of one and a quarter rupee. You and gift!? Either you've gone mad... ...else you're not the same person or this money is fake. They're real. And listen. If you show that beautiful sight to my beautiful bull -like eyes. - Then I'll kiss you till your cheeks go wet. - No. And also give you a prize of Rs.2.50. - Rs.2.50! - Go and enjoy yourself. - Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law! - What happened, Ravi? - Sister-in-law, it's just that... that... - C'mon. Tell me. It's just that... it's just that... I... Are you going to say something or just go on like a goat? - Is it something important? - Yes, it is. Sister-in-law, I do that to a girl. Love. - What's new about it? - What? Yes. This age is like that. At this age boys either fight with others or fall in love. Ok, tell me who's that girl? She's from our village only. Milawat Ram's daughter. Oh, his daughter? Why? What happened, Sister-in-law? Shall I tell it directly? We can never have any relation with them. Forget that girl and do your job. Sister-in-law, I've full faith in you. I had thought that if you told brother about it first... ...then brother wouldn't refuse. - You believe me, isn't it? - Yes, Sister-in-law. Similarly, when I feel that your brother won't refuse... ...only then do I ask him about it. And even if I do go and ask him... ...then he would scream at me first and then at you. - Sister-in-law! - Yes, Ravi. You go and tell this to that girl. And I know that the girl is very good. But you know better than me about his family. [GIGGLES] I'm telling you something sad and you're laughing!? What else should I do? Sir, only your sister-in-law has refused to the marriage now. - Then? - Then, you're worried over such a trivial thing!? Wait and watch what's going to happen next. Now, your brother will come to know. He'll say, Ravi! I'll break your bones. Then my dad will come to know, he'll burst like an atom bomb. He'll say, Banderlekha, which pot of sin have you given birth to!? Then the whole village will come to know. There will be gossiping all around. The village counsel will have a sitting. There'll be a lot of drama, only then will we be able to marry. Our marriage will take place after so much bursting and cracking? Forgive me, boss. - But there's a little mistake in the world of Gods. - What? - You should've been a girl instead of a boy. - Eh! It'll. It'll. It definitely will. Ram your... [LAUGHING] [CUCKOO COO] Call the boss. What's happened? Hey have you become a monkey suddenly? Kissing me!? I'll bash you up. - 2.50 Rs. - What are you doing? Lalita was kissing Ravi. [GIGGLES] [GRUNTS] - Did you see, how he's shredding my honor to pieces? - Don't shout! This bastard is sticking on to my girl as if it's his father's locker... ...and you're telling me not to shout? My blood is boiling like soda and you tell me not to shout!? I will shout. I will shout. You hooligan, they may not tell you anything. But I can definitely kill my daughter. I can cut her to pieces and feed her to the ants. - I don't want such a daughter. - No! no! Milawat Ram! What are you doing? Have you gone mad!? Yes, I've gone mad because I've been dishonored. My honor has been auctioned like an old house. Where is she? Ok, you managed to save her. But I won't spare myself. What's this, brother? It's ok for you. But what'll happen to my sister? She'll be widowed. Ok, you're forcefully stopping me, so I'm stopping. But the dung of disgrace which has been smeared on my face... ...the dung which my daughter has smeared. Who's going to clean it!? Milawat Ram, it's uncouth to scream around. If you want justice, you'll get it. Where will I get it? In your shop? In the village counsel. What a place you have mentioned for getting justice! What justice will you get there, when his brother is the judge? He'll just clean his own dirty linen. You people haven't recognized Vijay, yet. When he judges, he doesn't care for his family. Absolutely! - Whose is this? - Yours. You come with me, I'll get you justice. Did you see? How the opening of the cooperative shop has benefited the village? Every home has become happy, costs have... ...reduced, adulteration has stopped. - Wow! - And even Milawat Ram has been destroyed. His honor has been swept off. A cooperative shop was opened here... ...and along with it a shop for selling my honor was opened too. What happened? What's the matter? Ok, you're asking me? I'm not able to say. I'm feeling dizzy. Ask them. Tell him, what're you standing for? The matter is, Chief... ...his daughter and a boy of our village love each other. Wow, what a way to narrate! His daughter and a village boy love each other!? Why don't you tell him clearly what the boy did to her? Now, no one will let his girl pass by their houses. Forget letting their sons marry her. First tell me, who is the boy, who is related to this case? If you hear the name, then your heart will shatter like glass. It's an order. Tell me the name. Sir, he's your younger brother. My brother!? Did all of you see it with your own eyes? Yes, we saw it with our own eyes. - Rahim uncle! - Yes. Sit in this chair. - Me! Vijay! - Please come, come, and sit. Because the matter is related to my brother, I leave this chair. Very good! When it was my son's turn... ...you were holding on to the chair strongly. Now when it's your brother's turn, you are leaving it. So that people come to know how righteous you are! Whatever judgment I give, sitting in this chair, will not be accepted by Lalaji. - Hey! You sit and give the judgment first. - Just shut up. I'm trying to remove him from the post and you're asking to be there? Shut up! Yes, you may leave. Ravi! Ravi! Where is that insolent fellow? I will break his bones today. - You know what he has done? - What? He is in love with Milawat Ram's daughter. I know that. You Know!? Then why didn't you tell me before? Look, I have scolded him more than what you'll scold. Even then he didn't listen to you. He has become so ill-mannered and disobedient. He is neither disobedient nor ill mannered. But on my advice, he had gone to tell Lalita that... ...this marriage isn't possible. And by the time he told her, the whole village... ...had assembled and turned it into a controversy. Now this matter has reached the village counsel. I have given up the post... ...and appointed Uncle Rahim to take the decision. Frankly speaking you should have judged the matter. Had you been the father of that girl what would have you done? After such a dishonor who would marry the girl? That poor girl, her life has been spoiled. This is neither the fault of girl nor the boy. But of age. But falling in love isn't a crime or a sin. The best thing to do would be, to get both of them marry. I would like that you announce the marriage yourself... ...as the elder brother of the bridegroom. Before the village counsel announces its decision,... ...I would like you to announce the marriage. Vijay dear, the panchayat has reached a decision. I accept the proposal of marriage. I approve of this marriage. God is great! As long as there are people like you, son... ...justice and truth shall prevail on earth. Finally you've done justice, son. Only half justice has been done yet. The full justice would be done only when he comes to my brother's house. First, let some conclusions be reached on the exchange talks. If there are some conditions, some exchange talks... ...then why not we decide it over here? - Come inside. - No! No! My brother-in-law is saying the right thing. For the first time in these years, has he spoken something wisely. My honor, which had been sold as a black market... ...product will be restored only after the groom's family does... ...something worthwhile. They've to come to my home... ...and talk to me, only then will there be a... ...restoring effect to the harm done to my honor. For the sake of my brother, not only your house... ...I'm ready to talk at the middle of a street. As the whole village knows... ...that Vijay and Ravi aren't real brothers, but step brothers. That's why I want that the property... ...be distributed equally between them. Beware, Milawat Ram! Don't even by mistake, ever try to... ...use the word 'step' between us. We are brothers, just brothers. Our relationship is far greater than "step" and "real". You called us home and abused us. Our house is a temple, where people worship and not divide it. If it is so, then you can't marry my daughter. - It's okay then. - Wait Ravi! If for this marriage, partition is the condition, then I accept it. What are you saying? It's impossible. Our souls can be separated from our body. Our shadows can be separated, but not us. Look, Ravi. Souls and hearts are those legacies... ...which have been given to us by our father. The people of this world can't divide these. But you've liked the girl from this family. It's your duty to take care of their likes and dislikes. Keeping them happy is also your duty. Wow! Vijay dear, you are great. It sounds as if I am listening to hymns from the Geeta. The justice that you have done,... ...even the world's greatest of court can't do that. Yes Ravi! Brother is absolutely right. You should listen to the chief, I mean your brother. If this is the chief's decision, I don't accept it. I refuse it. Where are going after giving your decision? Go after listening to my decision too. What do you mean? We fell in love together. We decided to marry together. If we decide on these two issues... ...then we ourselves will decide on this too. Listen to our decision. If the partition takes place, then we refuse to marry. Who says that an angel doesn't take birth at devil's house? The example is in front of us. Yes brothers, if the boy and girl are ready to marry... ...without any partition, then on behalf of the village counsel... ...I give them permission to marry. Then let it happen so. But Rahim brother, this decision would be against us. - Isn't it, brother-in-law? - Who is your brother? I don't know you. The one who doesn't accept the panchayat's decision... ...I don't recognize him. I'm not going to fall for you. The decision of the village counsel is equal to God's own decision. And I won't refuse to abide by God's decision. This marriage will take place and definitely take place. Congratulations! Congratulations! [SANSKRIT CHANTS] - 53, 54, 55, 56... - 205, 206... 207. 208... - 60, 65... - Hey what are you doing? - Stealing. Due to stealing your father got into trouble... ...because of which he died there itself. And you... don't you feel ashamed. What are you trying to do? Now our shop is closed. So I'm taking these home all these are made of pure ghee... ...and I would taste them... ...and decide on their price. Think a little, you shameless pickle,... ...if someone sees, what will they say. - 135 - What!? 135. - This sweet is rupees 135. - You shameless, feel a little ashamed. My daughter has been newly married. Shouldn't I go and give her some advice. If you want to give some advice, then do it now. If someone else gives the advice before you... ...then you will be thrown overboard. Keep quiet. Lalita! Lalita! - Mother! - Move aside. Look, dear. Now we are going. We have got you married. Our responsibility ends there. Now onwards your husband is your God. [GIGGLING] You're laughing... Why are you laughing!? What did you say? Her husband is her God! Had she been the one who looked upon her husband... ...as God, she wouldn't have done so on your word. Look there, your God! What have you done to him. Oh shut up! Listen dear, come and sit over here. And listen carefully to whatever advice I'm giving. Don't compromise on anything. If that crooked, cunning sister-in-law asks, why. You ask, why eh? If she says, come over here. You reply, why should I? Are thorns pricking your feet? Keep fighting for everything. Reply back for everything. After getting fed up with your bickering... ...Vijay will decide to move to a separate place. Okay, now tell me. After separation... ...how will you manage your household chores? How do I manage, mother? That's what I am going to tell now. - Start preparing. - How? I have an idea. Listen carefully. I will send you a basket of wooden planks. You send it back to me filled with silver utensils. I will send you a bowl of pulses... ...you return it with a gold ring in it. Enough, mother! Enough. Whatever you told me now, Had every mother told this... ...to their daughters and had the daughters abided by it... ...then I suppose, this world would've transformed into hell. You are that disease that has no cure. If your shadow falls on damp wood, it would set fire to it too. Listen carefully now, father come over here. From today, this house is my house. The happiness and sorrow is mine. This family's enemy is my enemy. From today onwards try and forget me. Still If you want to see me, send a word. I would come to see you, myself. None of you would come here. Did you hear me? Now pick up the sweets and keep moving. The daughter has slapped you so hard that... ...your face has turned into a sandal. Has your heart been cooled or is something else left? Look here, my mood is off. You don't bother me. Boss, don't mistake me. Is this your daughter or...? What Banderalekha? Is she really my daughter or did you...? What!? Come on. Hurry up. Pick it up. [HUMMING] Hey stupid! Who are you dreaming about with your eyes closed? Hey Chandravati, Taravati, the light of my darkness... ...I was dreaming about you. Liar! The monsoon has come and gone... ...but my whole body burnt like a mango. But what could I do. I was compelled to be with my stingy boss. But my boss isn't at the shop today. - Really! - Show me your bag. Your bag is empty. Mewalal's lover's bag is empty. - Look. - I will just fill it up. You keep asking, I'll keep filling it - Give it to me. - Jump in. - Give it to me. - Jump in. Hurry up before someone sees. Jump in. Jump in. Take these stinky goods. Give them to your mother. - Give me some biscuits. - Yes, sure, take some biscuits too. Take some Marie also. Take whatever you want. Take whatever you want. Take this too. Hey my lover, what has happened to your hair suddenly? How've they become so small and spiky. Try to remember. Last time I stole from the shop of... ...stingy boss and gave you a scented oil. Didn't you apply it to your hair. And how come you are suddenly stinking so much? Did you hug my boss before your came here? Because, since birth, that idiot hasn't ever bathed. The stingy boss's body is smelling? I haven't taken bath since birth? You idiot, you considered the goods in my shop as your father's property and... ...you were thrusting into that Phoolmati's bag!? Today I am not going to rest until I feed you rat poison. - No, No, No. - Open your mouth. Sister-in-law, I want to ask you something. Ask. What's the matter? Since the time I have come into this house, have I hurt you even once? No at all. But why are you asking such a question? Because from 4 in the morning... ...till late in the night you do the chores. Don't I have half the share in it. No only half, you've the full share in this house. Then why are you not letting me do any work. Lalita, the reason I don't let you do any work is... ...I want you to have that which I haven't had in all these years. What you didn't get, Sister-in-law!? My husband's time, a few moments with him... ...to speak a few words of love with him. But he is more worried about the village than his house. Instead of keeping his wife happy... ...he tries to keep the villagers happy. He spends most of his time doing social service. He is so drowned in their service that... ...I can only stand on the banks and watch him. Don't think that I'm bad mouthing him. Which other woman has been so lucky... ...who has got a God like husband? Lalita, We are family people. Living lives like a saint is difficult for us. I want you to be a human. Be near to your husband always. Love him so much that even a moment's separation from you is difficult for him. That's why I don't let you do any work. No, you're unnecessarily driving me to your head. If brother, comes to know that this girl... ...follows her husband throughout the day like a fly. What'll he think about me? So that he doesn't mistake me, you've to give me half the work. Ok, dear. Why half? From today you can do all the chores. - Take the key. - What'll I do with the keys!? When you're taking the responsibility you've to take it fully. From now onwards, you know and your house knows. Now you've to manage. Sister-in-law! What are you doing? You scared me! And you melted my heart. - Someone will come. - Then let them come. Sweeten my mouth immediately, else I'll stick like glue. If I get angry, then I'll do something. You're threatening me? You do what you can, but before that see what I do. - What's this? - Coconut sauce. I asked you for a kiss and you smeared coconut sauce on my face? Don't care for the place or the occasion. - You do that whenever you feel like it. - Why can't I? I haven't eloped with you. I've married you. Everything of mine has been spoilt. I mean, my life. Where are you going? - It's burning. - Can't you see my heart burning? So much anger!? Be patient, sir. A storm can't wash away water from the well. Try to understand the gravity of the situation. I'm not going to go anywhere else. Wait for sometime. Listen, waiting, that too after marriage. [GIGGLING] Impossible! I want to ask you something, how's your sister in law related to me? She's like your sister. - Are we real sisters? - No. Meaning. Even after being born in different families we are... ...living together over here as own sisters... ...then only will this house be. And because I'm new to this house... ...I want to prove to brother and Sister-in-law... ...that even though I'm from a different household... ...my soul has always been here. And that I'm like their sister. And as long as I don't prove this to them, I won't be your wife. You've to be patient till then. Lalita, come here. You are definitely your didi's younger sister. But for yrs, we've been longing for a child... ...and to our eyes you're a child. The lack of a child was bothering us, you've fulfilled that desire. You're a goddess who has come to our house in different forms. You're a daughter, a wife and a sister... Be happy. Be happy. Why Lalita? You didn't listen to me? What didn't I listen to, Didi? He loves you so much. And he always follows you around. Yet, you stay away from him. Go. Go near him and spend some time with him. Caring for the husband is the wife's first duty. Go. - Sister-in-law! - What? Shall we go out for a few days? Yes, why not? I'll arrange for it now itself. Very good, I'll arrange for it immediately. - Is anybody there? - Hey listen. Ravi come here. Yes! Ravi! What's this? Brother, I was eating coconut and it slipped over my face. - The coconut slipped? - Yes. I know everything. Go and wash your face. - Okay. - Listen, why you don't do one thing. Why don't you take your wife to a hill station for a few days. Ooty, Mussorie, Kodaikanal, etc. Wherever you feel like? Yes! - You owl, how'll you go? - Yes, how will I go? Here take this Rs.10000 and enjoy yourselves. Lalita, get ready to go to Ooty. I've got Rs.10000. - Ooty!? - Yes! - Only both of us? - Yes, only the two of us. I won't go without Didi. Great, then the holiday's over. If you tell this to Sister-in-law. Then she would say that she won't come without brother. Great! That's what I want. I want them both to come with us. - They too!? - Yes, they too. After going there, we'll shut them up in a room. That's the reason I had told Sister-in-law about this. Both of them in a room in Ooty. Why!? Tell me, why!? O God! What's this problem. Did you pass M.A. or did anyone else do it on your behalf? - Why don't you understand? - I understood. - Then you go and tell them. - No. I'm feeling shy. Ok, you feel shy and I'm shameless!? You go and tell them. - No you go and tell them. - No you tell them. - You... - You... What're you trying to say? Now go. What happened, Ravi? I was washing my face and slipped. You slipped there and fell here. [COUGHS] Brother, Lalita was saying that if... ...Sister-in-law doesn't come, then she also won't. - Why, dear? - She feels scared. You shut up! When your husband is coming along with you why should you feel scared? If Sister-in-law doesn't come then I won't go too. Ok, then you take your Didi along with you. Brother, why don't you understand!? If Didi doesn't come, then I won't come. If you won't come then Didi won't come. So we'll all go together else none of us will go. Now a new problem. What problem? You only said that you didn't have any work for 10 days. I said I didn't have work, but that doesn't mean... ...I go to Ooty for a holiday. Now look at Ooty and at me. Why you've become so old? - No, I haven't become so old but... - What're you saying, brother. - In the city, the girls will whistle. - What did you say? I had banana for breakfast. That's why my tongue slipped. If a slap slips from my hand, do you know where you'll go? - Ooty. Listen to me. If you don't go then even I won't go. I was supposed to grant leave to the school... Okay I will take care of that later. - Make arrangements for our departure. - My job is done. My job is done. - "This year..." - "This year..." "This year... It should happen this year..." "This year... after many years.?" "This year... after many years." "The season to love has come." "The season to live and die has come." "The season to love has come."

But came to know that you had gone to Ooty. Yes, we came to know about it on our return. That's why we have come to attend the feeding ceremony of the child. It was very kind of you. Thank you. Come in. My daughter Lalita has lost so much weight. [CRYING] Mother, you have become so fat. Do you eat the whole village's food. Lalita, what sort of misbehavior is this? Do you treat your mother like this? Come on. Saw, how badly she scolded my daughter. Take sister, take the child in your arms... ...feed him the first morsel of food with your lucky hands... Being a child's mother, you are feeding its food... ...from this sterile woman's hand. If the child eats from her hands it will become poison for him. Your child will die. Mother, what nonsense are you talking? I am telling the right thing. She is infertile. So she doesn't want anyone else to have a child. - Mother, you go away from here. - Why should I go? - If need be, let her go away from here. - Mother... Lalita, when we've come here for a good cause, then why fight? Give this child to your mother, so that she feeds the first morsel. - No, sister. You feed him. - No, Lalita. No sister. You feed him. I'm feeling scared. No, sister, when I myself being the mother of the child... I'm not feeling scared, then why should you? I am confident that my child will be lucky and purified... ...after eating from your hands. - No. - Come on, feed him. Take this. Hey Lalita! You have brought water in such a small utensil... ...bring some more. Leave it. [WATER SLOSHING] Hey Lalita, Lalita. Give it to me. Who asked you to lift this? Sister. Laxmi, Laxmi, Laxmi! Did you tell her to lift this? But I just told her to bring some water. Look, what's happening to her. Lalita, Lalita, what happened to you? Hey Ravi! Ravi! - What happened brother? - Lalita is not keeping well. - Call the doctor. - Yes. Come, Lalita. [DIALER TONE] Breathe. - Laxmi, get some buttermilk for Lalita. - Fine. Mr. Chaudhury, there is good news for you. Lalita is going to be a mother. Congratulations, Ravi. A hearty congratulations to you. Laxmi, there is a good news. Lalita is going to be a mother. What!? Laxmi, what happened Laxmi? Doctor! Doctor! What happened? Please check her. Congratulations, Mr. Chaudhury. The disease which Lalita has, Laxmi also has. You are going to become a father. God, has given us so much happiness at the same time... ...that I'm unable to bear it. Brother! Come on Raja start. - Come, come. - Listen to this... listen to this. Listen, did you hear anything. - Listen, did you hear anything. - What happened Manderlekha? Why are you shouting? First breathe and then tell me the matter. I have a good news. You and good news. I don't believe it. If darkness says that it has brought light then... I can believe it. But if you say that you've brought... ...good news then I can't believe. I swear on you. It's a good news. First have some sweets. Now listen. You are to be a grandpa and me a grandma. Lalita is pregnant. I' happy that Lalita is pregnant. But tell me first that the sugar that you dumped into my mouth... ...is it pure or from our shop, the adulterated one. It's the pure one. Don't worry. But there's a bad news with it. What? Laxmi is also pregnant. Let her be. What is your father's problem? What are you saying? When our daughter is pregnant... ...how could that infertile woman be pregnant too? I'll find out and tell you in a moment. Oh God! Oh Vishnu! Oh Mahesh! Oh Ganesh! Why are you spoiling my daughter's life? Why are you adulterating even a mother's love? What was the necessity for her to be pregnant? That too at the same time? What's this new play? Now, we've to bring our daughter home. I don't want my daughter, Lalita to give birth to her... ...first child in the presence of that cursed woman. This is correct. Is someone there? Greetings! Please come in. No coming in. I heard that my daughter is expecting. Call her. Our daughter is going to be a mother for the first time. I want her to deliver the child at my place. I want to take her home before nightfall. Why not? Why not? You please sit. I'll bring her. - Get up! - You sit everywhere. Lalita, your parents have come to take you. They want that your first child be born at their home. You mean I have to go there? No, I don't mean that. I mean that, your happiness is our happiness. Your happiness is more important to us. Isn't it? Then you tell me, where does my happiness lie? I think, your happiness lies where your Didi is. Then send them away. What are you saying? They're your parents. In what respect? Look. - Sister, can you wait outside for a minute? - Why not? What's the matter, Lalita? Brother, have you ever thought that even sister is pregnant. I have parents so I can go to them, but who'll look after sister? If I go there, she'll feel so hurt, how much pain it'll cause her. I agree, that my first child should be born at my parents home. But this place is no less than home for me. I will stay here. I won't go anywhere. Ok, I'll make your parents see reason. I told Lalita about this, but she wants to stay here. Who wants to know of her will? She's an innocent kid. Look here, I'm telling you. I won't leave my child alone under such condition. You don't need to worry about her? We'll take care of her. What will you take care of? Does anyone in this house have an experience of bearing children? The tree on which there are no fruits, what'll it give to others? This is my daughters first child, if something happens to her... ...then who'll be responsible? Being a mother, why are you talking such bad things for your daughter? How else shall I talk? My heart is burning due to tension. What if something happens to my daughter? If something happens, then you'll be duly informed. You can come over and perform the last rites. Lalita, do you talk to your parents like this? How else do I talk, brother? They don't understand polite words. - Ok, you go inside now. - Why should I? They've come to take me, couldn't they ask sister too? They could've told her, come dear, what if you don't have parents. We'll take care of you. Then I would have agreed that my parents have humanity in them. - Lalita! - Brother, whatever greatness you show to them... ...it isn't going to make a difference to them. Light can never be separated from the lamp. - Come on. Come on. - Lalita. Wait! Wait! Stop them. Why should I stop them? The girl who's like her mother... ...I'm not her father. I'm going. Listen, a cursed woman stays here. She'll harm my daughter. I don't care whether she's cursed or stingy. - I'm going. - Listen! Listen! [SOBBING] Don't argue, otherwise I'll eat you raw. Now tell me madam, why were you two fighting? That Vijay's wife Laxmi is of bad omen. If her shadow falls on my daughter's would be baby... Wait a minute. You mean to say just because of her shadow her evil sight. - Your daughter's child will not survive. - Yes. And what ever things we have done will not have... ...any effects on the child? - What have we done? - What have we done! We have done a lot of sins. We have done adulteration in the milk powder... ...and spoilt the health of thousands of children. How many of them are handicapped? Won't we get the punishment for that sin? Won't we? We will get. He is right. I am scared, will our grandson be born or not? If born, will he survive? I am quite nervous. There is one way. Both of you go back in the same car... - ...in which you had come. - Where? On pilgrimage. Do not spare any temple, any lake or any river. Dip in that and go on washing your sins. Go quickly. - Okay. - I will look after the shop. I will take care. I will take care. I will take care. I will take care. Oh God, my shop! [TEMPLE BELL] - Wherever I forget you remind me. - Okay. Oh God... ...O Almighty! You know I got my daughter married... ...to Vijay Chaudhary for money. Now she is pregnant. She is to deliver a child. All my life I have done mixing but you don't do mixing in her womb. I say God, you take birth from her womb. And if you take birth, I will make a diamond necklace... ...of Rs. One Lakh and offer it to you. What are you doing? If you are promising God... ...you'll have to fulfil it. If you offer one lakh to God what will be left for us? Ask for 5 -10 paise. What? You fool, you bag of stones in rice... ...the promises given to God are not to be fulfilled. We have to say like that till it is done. After that we have to break them. This betrayal I had learnt from your daddy. Is it so? Then ask for Rs. Two Lakhs. - Two Lakhs? - Yes! Okay God, one lakh is cancelled... ...I'll give a necklace for two lakhs believe me. There is no question of mixing in it. No. 'Indian health fund' Chaudhary sir, your wife is absolutely okay. Delivery will be easy, but... But what doctor? Lalita's condition... What happened to Lalita? Tell me. I warned you that day, that she is very delicate of weak heart. She will have lots of problems during delivery. Now after seeing her condition I don't know what to do? To save the child or the mother. No, no doctor, don't say that. Save both of them. I love both of them. Save both of them I am requesting you doctor. We will try our best. But it will be God's wish. I am prescribing some medicines. They are difficult to get, but find them and get them. Okay, take it. - Brother I'll get it. - Come soon. Doctor, Laxmi-ji got a child. What! An unfortunate like me, has become a father? Laxmi. Yes I am Laxmi. Now you will call me with this name. Sometime back I got another name, childless. I was called a childless. Now no one will call me childless. Because I am a mother. Mother. Are you happy now? Yes Laxmi, I am very happy but Lalita... Doctor, Come soon. - What happened? - Lalita... Okay I'm coming. Chaudhary sir, you stay here. What is this going on? What are you hiding from me? Nothing Laxmi. You don't worry unnecessarily. No, there is definitely something... ...that is why you are so worried. Go quick and find out what has happened to Lalita. Alright, I'll be back soon. What has happened to Lalita doctor? How is she now? She is okay. But the child is lifeless. - What? - But Lalita is absolutely alright. She is now out of danger. But there is a problem. First she is very weak. The delivery was also painful. So her heart has become very weak. And at this time she is not in the position to bear slightest shock. She knows about the death of the child? Not yet. She is still unconscious. But when she is conscious she should not know it. Otherwise it can kill her. Before she is conscious we should keep a child born today, next to her. I got it doctor. Can I see Lalita? Doctor, what if she is conscious now? She is about to get it. Go quickly. Okay! What happened? How is she? She is okay. What do you mean? She is out of danger but... But what? She got the child or not? The child was born, but it died. Oh God, what have you done? After her coming to the house, I became pregnant after so many years. You have blessed an unfortunate woman like me with a child... ...and robbed her of her child. I want to see her. Take me there. Lalita is weak from the beginning. Now she is not in a position to bear even a small shock. The doctor has said the news of the death of the child... ...could be the cause of her death. I don't understand what to do. I have come to you with a hope. I don't know from where to start? What is there to think about? We will keep our child next to her before she is conscious. And we will tell her, this is your child. If she asks about our child... ...what reply we will give? We will say our child died. What are you saying? This is not the truth. It is only to please her. Yes we will say but how long? Till she is strong enough. It may take a month, 10 months or even 10 years. We will have to say. Laxmi it is getting late. This is not the time to think. You take him. I don't mind. We will say now our child died after birth. [CRYING] But afterwards when... ...we say our child was not dead... ...this is our child, who will believe us? Laxmi, our Lalita is fighting between death and life... ...instead of worrying about her you are worried of others? You don't know how these people have abused me... ...they are calling me a woman who can never give birth to a child. They even consider my shadow as a bad omen. Today, after years God has answered them... ...that Laxmi is not childless. She can also give birth to a child. She can be a mother. Today, when I got the opportunity to... ...take this child and show to the people with pride... ...you want me to tell the people that my child was born dead? Even after becoming a mother... ...you want me to be called childless? I am ready to give my child to Lalita forever. But I want to show the world at least once... ...that I am not childless. I have given birth to this child... ...and the child should get my name. No it can't be done. The name will not be given by you, but by Lalita. And along with Lalita the whole world... ...will think that this child is born to Lalita and not you. No I can't do that. I am requesting for the last time, Laxmi. Please agree. Because of your yes she will live... ...and because of your no she will die. How do you know how the world has tortured me? What they are talking about you. Laxmi is not the only one responsible for her infertility. Her husband is also responsible for it. I want to show my child to them and silence them. And I will do it. [FOOTSTEPS] Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother, I am a father Lalita got a child. How cute the child is. Come. Come with me. Come. See brother. Congratulations. Sister-in-law... ...shall I call it as God's wish... ...or injustice of fate. I don't know. Lalita should have missed... ...and God should have blessed you with a child. Then I would not have been unhappy. Because I value your tears more than my child. Don't cry. Don't cry. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [TEMPLE BELL] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Oh Lalita, you are also behaving like a modern girl. Like modern girls? What do you mean? Today's modern girls give bottled milk... ...to the child instead of their own milk. So that their figure is maintained. You are also doing the same. If you want to make the child healthy... ...you should feed your own milk. I know but what can I do if it is not written in my fate? I was weak. After Kishan's birth... ...blood was less so I was more weak... ...that is why milk is not produced. Sorry, I wasn't aware. But in this matter Laxmi is great. God has snatched her child... ...but she loves Kishan more than her own. And when she loves Kishan her motherhood starts flowing. And with that her breasts starts flowing with milk for Kishan. She has all the virtues of an Indian woman. There is no doubt in that. I wish her child were alive. But this child... What is the relation between fruits of a tree and salt of the sea. But when they meet... ...a new thing starts. Same way Sister, and I both delivered a child. But only sister was fortunate with the milk. Okay, look after the child. I'll go and see... ...whether sister has eaten food or not? I don't know why after meeting you... - Where are you taking the child? - To Sister. - But why? - The child will sleep immediately besides her. Lalita... ...why are you leaving your child besides me? Go and take him there. No, no, sister my hands are tired of lifting... ...him the whole day. I can't do it. Make him sleep with you. That's okay. But what happens if he wakes up in the middle of the night... ...and starts crying asking for the milk? No, no he won't get up. He sleeps nicely with you and troubles me only. I am already weak. There is not enough blood. If I die, who will look after Kishan? Lalita, don't use such bad words. Let your enemies die. Go and sleep. I will make him sleep. Go. Oh mother. Oh my waist is breaking. My head is tearing apart. The mind is rotating like a fan. What happened? Pain of the heart. Pain of the soul. Pain of the head. Pain of the waist. I'll go and get a doctor. What does this mean? It means you are also fooled by it like sister. I have given the child to sister by doing the same drama. It is okay if you gave the child, but why this drama? I am sorry. You have become father of a child. But you are not less than a child. Don't you understand... ...sister gave birth to a child after so many years but God snatched it. Now won't she be upset by this? Oh no. Go! [BANGELS JINGLING] "Listen my sister." "Listen my friend." "Listen my sister." "Listen my friend." "The child is like a rose." "We are like jasmine and mogra."

Come on. Come on. Sit here. Sit here. Sit here. Many people don't know how to live the life after marriage. Later on they repent. I don't want it. So first we will do a rehearsal for it. Okay tell me what is the first thing you will do after marriage? I will run the house. If you don't run the house, will you run an orphanage? I know that. How will you run the house? By taking things on credit. The whole country is doing the same thing what is new in that? No, no. What will you do in the morning when you get up? - Hold it. - Yes. I will stretch my body. You will stretch and do all the things, what have I to do about that... ...tell me the important thing. In the morning I'll pray to God. - That means you will leave me? - Why? You fool. After marriage, the husband is a God. First you will bow to me. Yes I understood. What will you do afterwards? After that I will not eat unless you come back. You won't eat. But when I come back you will give me food, isn't it? - Yes, yes definitely. - Well it is fine up to here. Now tell me the real thing. What will you do at night time? At night I will eat with your own hands and fill my stomach. Shut up! You are from a beggars family. You include food in all the matters. What will you do after eating? - I will sleep. - Back off! Is this a life? I will sleep? Okay then you tell me. I don't understand anything. I'll explain. We will do a drama. Let us suppose you are a man. And I am your wife. Who are you? I am a man. And who am I? My wife. In the evening the husband comes home tired and calls his wife. How will he call his wife? Hey you bloody idiot. Why are you sitting there? Come here. Don't you see I have come home tired? Oh God! How tired you look. The body also gives out sounds. What work you have done and come home? Why are you asking that? Have you cooked or not? [GIGGLING] Yesterday's stale porridge is there. Day before yesterday's dal is there. It is not spoiled much. - Neighbour's dog tasted it. - Shall I heat it for you? Shameless, lazy am I your wife? Or you are my wife? You scoundrel you are not doing any work. The husband has come home tired. You have not cooked. You have not given any food. Not prepared the bed. Come on get up. - Listen. - Close the windows. Come on press my legs. - See this. - You son of a donkey, out. Out. Hey what's happening here. Go away. - Why are you hitting me? - Hit them. - Donkeys. - My boss is wedded for so many years. But his wife has never pressed his legs this way. Bastard doesn't know how to make love. He only knows adulteration. A miser. A total miser. A scoundrel. A burnt bitter gourd. An over ripe banana. A watermelon with an aerial like tail. The sinner has gone on pilgrimage. Sinner. A spoilt pumpkin. - Bloody... Hey! - Who is it? - I'm a rotten cabbage? - Beat him. Beat him. I don't know how to press my wife's legs. I always adulterate things. Hit him. Why are you hitting me? Why did you allow him to run away? He should be beaten thoroughly. Why did you allow him to run? He should be beaten thoroughly. He is a 50 kg. man not empty bag whom I can beat like that. And you have not spared any breath for me. Even if I lift a handkerchief I get tired. Listen. I am very tired. Press my legs. What? I will do it? Aren't you ashamed? You didn't see what he was doing? Come on. Start it. Shame on us men. Brother-in-law. - Can I come in? - Yes. I was looking at the lines of her feet and telling her future. Congratulations. Lalita has given birth to a baby boy. Oh God! Our pilgrimage is successful. But brother. That unfortunate idiot was also pregnant what happened? His child died as soon as it was born. [CRYING] What is the matter? Why are you crying on such an auspicious occasion? All our pilgrimage has gone to a waste. We are very sorry to hear that your child died. After so many years it was born that is also lost. It is God's wish. I have to go for a meeting. You can see your grandson. Lalita. Lalita, Lalita. Save my grandson. He will not survive. - Save him, save him. - Shut up. Why are you shouting like hell? The building has burnt? Is there a fire? Not the building, my heart is burning. This unfortunate woman is feeding our child with her milk. Mother, you have come here again? And you have started your drama? You started taunting. Why are you shouting so much? Ask what has not happened? Okay what has not happened? See that unfortunate, that snake that childless... ...woman is feeding our child with her milk. Don't abuse, what is wrong if she is feeding him with milk. You are a big fool. This lady remained infertile for so many years. This year she gave birth to a child. And this cobra ate her own child. And today this cobra is feeding her poison to our child. Mother, I am warning you once again. Don't utter a single word against sister. She is a Goddess. Forget her milk, even if she offers poison to him... ...it will be nectar for my child. Understand. You two have come after a long time so I am requesting... ...you to get out of here quietly. Get out? Such a big insult? I am not insulting you. This house is like a temple, a goddess stays here... ...I am just preventing you from insulting her. - Go away. - Okay I am going. But I am telling you, if this unfortunate woman touches... ...the child or feeds him with her milk... ...means she victimized the child with her bad sight. She has killed her own child. She will not spare your child. See one day the child will vomit... ...vomit blood he will get high fever... ...and there will be no cure for it... ...because there is no cure for curse and bad sight... And one day the child will die. Then you will remember what I said. Mother, will you go out or I will have to throw you out? Leave me. Leave me. Sister, take the child. No. Now I will not touch the child. I will never touch him. I am scared. Sister, are you taking the child or not? No. I can't take the child. I should not take. I will not take. Sister, you are under my oath. Take the child. No, Lalita please agree to what I say. Don't be stubborn. Sister... - Feed him with your milk. - No. I said feed him with your milk. Feed him your milk. Feed him with your milk. No farmer will sell his land. The purchaser might be from this village or an outsider. For a farmer his land is his mother. And no human can trade his mother. As far as old dues are there. The govt. has so many ways. Don't come under any pressure or threat to sell your land. No body can even touch your crop. Brothers, there is one good news. The money you had put in the panchayat to buy seeds and fertilizers. The material has come and is kept safely in Vijaybabu's godown. [APPLAUSE] Enough, enough. We are only waiting for the time and weather. We all will sow the seeds together. Our land will be one. Our efforts will be one. Our hearts will be one. And if God wishes the dreams we have seen would be true. Brother-in-law, you go in... ...I am keeping a watch here to see that no one comes here. Come on. [CLATTER] Come on hurry up. Hurry. The thing is there are so many rats in the godown. ...so we have come here... ...to kill them by putting in the pesticides. Wait. [CRICKET CHIRPING] You have troubled this village a lot... ...because of you there is a big loss. But this would be your last deed... ...so far police has not come to this village. And we don't want because of you sinners police should come here. So we have decided that you should leave... ...this village right now forever. - Brother-in-law. Brother-in-law. - Who are you? Forgive me. - Who are you? - Your brother-in-law. I am your brother-in-law. Which brother-in-law. Why are you abusing your sister by calling me your brother-in-law? I don't know you. Go away, you have spoilt my legs by touching it. Pannalal it is enough. Panchayat, show him the road out of the village. - I will not spare anyone. - Come on. I will see all of you. I will not spare anyone. Great, Vijay. You are even greater than great. You are taller than the tallest. Water in the sea is insufficient. Your heart is bigger than the sea. I congratulate you for saving this village. I am with you to shout. Long live falseness... Er... I mean long live truth. Down with falseness. Long live, no one is there. Long live brother Vijay. - Doctor Lilavati. - Yes. I am Vijay Choudhary speaking... ...the child is very sick all of a sudden. He is unconscious, he is not even opening the eyes. You come soon. - Okay, I am coming. - Thanks. Laxmi. - What had you fed the child? - Nothing. I swear, I have not fed him anything. If you have not fed him anything how he is like this? Why are you staring at me? Nothing. I am cursing my fate in my mind. Why did an unfortunate woman like me have to take care of him? In the world's eye a childless woman... ...whose shadow is also a bad omen... ...they are right I am the cause of his illness. There is no other reason. Sister, what nonsense you are talking? [TYRE SCREECH] Doctor. Doctor. Come doctor, quickly. Child has pneumonia. The child is suffering from acute bronco pneumonia. Was he bathed? - Yes. - When? Morning after an oil massage. That is why he has pneumonia. He is finding it difficult to breathe If he were a little older then there was no problem. Pneumonia in such a small age? Can't say anything. Oh God. I am giving him an injection. If he improves in three hours otherwise... No doctor. Doctor, you are the only witness of our secret... ...if anything happens to my Kishan... ...you know I will not survive. Laxmi-ji if God has slightest value for your sacrifice... ...then nothing will happen to this child. This is not said by a doctor but by a woman. Laxmi, Laxmi have patience. You are elder. If you behave like this then what will happen to Lalita? Go and pacify her. Give me the child. Lalita you don't worry. By the grace of God nothing will happen to our Kishan. He will be alright. But the doctor said there is a danger to his life. No. Don't take him. Don't take my child. Don't separate me from my child. Don't take my child away from me... Don't take my child away from me... Don't take my child. 'This bad omen snake has fed the child with her poison.' 'See one day the child will vomit.' 'Vomit blood.' 'He will have fever.' 'There will be no cure for it.' 'And one day the child will die.' No. Brother, give me my child. - I am taking the child to my house. - Are you crazy? - You want to take him home in this condition? - Yes. Because now I believe... - ...if he stays in this house he will not live. - Lalita. Are you mad? Lalita is right. Lalita take him. Take your child. But doctor has given him an injection. It will take three hours in curing. It is dangerous to take him out in this condition. Let her take him. Because now she thinks the child is not safe here. So it is now better for her to take the child. Lalita take him. - Go quickly. - Sister-in-law. Ravi, you also go. It is not safe for her to go alone. I am telling you, go. Oh God what has happened? I was telling you from the beginning don't keep him there. It is nice that you have brought him here. - You keep quiet. - You go and call Dr. Shiraz. [TEMPLE BELL] "Mother, come out in the open."

Go and inform brother and sister that Kishan is alright now. - They must be anxious. - Yes. Sister-in-law, brother, Kishan is alright now. Our Kishan is absolutely alright. Oh God thanks a million times. Now you go, go to your child. No sister-in-law. We are not needed there. Kishan is okay now. We want to come back. But you will have to give one promise. What promise? That you will forgive Lalita for her stupidity. Okay I forgive. Ravi, go and take care of the child and Lalita. And till doctor permits, stay there. Go, go my brother. Go. Hey stop. Hey stop. Why are you breaking my field? What is this your field, my field? This is all over now. Now all these fields are going to be one. Is it your father's property? They are going to be one! Milavatram-ji, for co-operative farming... ...our Chaudhary sir has announced to unify all the fields. So we have all decided that we will give this field to him. Why the field? Give him your wife and children as well. Why should I worry? But why are you removing the boundaries of my field? [DIGGING] - Where is the shovel? - It is here. - Yes. - What were you doing? I was breaking no, no, I was mixing it. You were mixing? It is good for the entire village. You are a fool, a donkey. It will not benefit the village but Chaudhary. First he will mix all the fields. Then he will swallow them all and make you dance. Oh, Milawatram, mind your language. - Vijaybabu is not a human. - That is what I am saying. - He is an angel. - What angel? He is a cheat, a crook, a scoundrel. He is speaking against Chaudhary sir. - Cut him. - Yes cut him. Cut him to pieces. Tear him apart. Beat him. Beat him up. Save me. Save me. Cut... Don't. Cut... Don't. Cut, Don't. You are talking for both the sides? This is the position of the country. Today, we are leaving you. If you utter anything now we will not spare you. - Come. - Come. - Why have you spared them? - Why have you spared them! Spared them. I asked you to save. You said cut. Sir, like your intentions your ears are also bad. You are unnecessarily running. I was telling them... Don't cut. But you disheartened me. You didn't cut. Okay, forget it. My name is Milawat. But Vijay mixed the fields smartly. Now see my crooked idea will spoil the decoration of his house. I don't understand boss. - You will never understand. Come. - I am coming. Donate Rs.500 /- to the orphanage from my side. - Congratulations Milawatram-ji. - Welcome. Congratulations for what? I have heard that you are joining our co-op farming. And you are giving your field to the panchayat? Yes you have heard it right. After so many years, my eyes have opened up... ...so I decided to be with your angel like chief. Well done, you have taken a wise decision. These are the papers for my land and this is the map. Map? For what? Map is very important. A human's life is not for ever. Today he is there tomorrow he may not be there. Tomorrow if I die... This is very bad. Don't laugh. Tomorrow if I die the inheritor of my land will be... ...not you, but my son-in-law and my daughter. How will they know from where their field... ...starts and where it ends? By this map. It is a must. - Otherwise there will be quarrels. - Isn't it? Haven't you made it? Take this. One copy is for you, one for me. Milawatram-ji you are right. - I think we all should make a map of our fields. - Yes. So that after our death, our kids do not have to fight for the land. You are right. Thanks a lot. You have shown the right way. Yes I have myself seen the right way. - Long live. - Bye. - Long live. - Bye. You have changed? Come Ravi, come. Your brother has given the biggest gift to the village is this co-op farming. And you must be pleased to know... ...that I have given all my fields... I heard it father-in-law. By doing that you have given proof of your intelligence. I am not intelligent. I am a bloody fool. Your brother is intelligent he has given all his fields... ...and started a new thing. Ravi brother, your fields also must be in it. Isn't it? You fool, don't you understand the meaning of all the fields? All fields mean, brother Vijay's fields Ravi's fields, isn't it? Yes but did he take your permission before giving them all? Brother Vijay, is not only the chief of this village... ...but also the chief of our house. He is God. And we don't question God. But Ravi, since he started this co-op farming... ...the villagers are talking this rubbish... What are they talking? Why are you standing like a statue? I can't say anything against him. I consider him an angel. If I say something my tongue will be twisted. - You tell it. - No. People say that brother Vijay does not have any child. But Ravi has a child. Who knows about tomorrow? If something goes wrong it will be difficult for you to eat. And they also say that without thinking, Vijaybabu... ...has given all the fields of the family... Hey! Brother Vijay has never taken any decision in haste. And he has never done anything to get name and fame. You fool! Our Vijaybabu has never done anything... ...to get name and fame. But Ravi, my child I don't agree fully. You are 60% right, but 40% is problem. What problem? Suppose if tomorrow there is an election... ...of Panchayat and if a new chief comes... ...if he cancels this co -op farming then? So what, we will take our fields back. How can we take it back? It is not that easy. When all the borders are removed... ...when all the fields merge... ...how will you know, which is your field, which is mine... ...off course he doesn't have any. How will we recognize our fields? That's why the boss has made a map of his field before giving it. - Here it is. - Show him. This is my field. After me, Lalita and you will inherit them... ...but how will you recognize your fields? Do you have an answer? Father, you are unnecessarily arguing on one point. Why should I recognize it? Brother Vijay is there. He knows it very well which are our fields... ...he will recognize them. But if tomorrow he is not there then? No, no. Don't get angry. Think about it with a cool mind. Add coolness on your anger. A human has got life to die. A man comes to this world to go away. Isn't it? As the boss is alive today, tomorrow if he dies... - Your dad will die. - I was only giving an example. Ravi, think about your child. Tomorrow he will need land for farming. On which land he will do it? - From whom he will ask for his land? - What you are talking? He will straightaway go to brother Vijay... ...and ask which are my fields? You donkey, his son is like a grandson to Vijay. Won't he be embarrassed to go and ask his grandpa? Isn't it? Am I wrong? No, you are right. Son, you ask your brother very politely, gently... ...honestly ask him where are my child's fields. - That's all. - No, I won't be able to do it. Why? Because in my whole life I have never questioned him. There is no need to question. I'll write a few words. You only sign on that. Yes. Opening the mouth is bad manners. Writing is good manners. Yes. Go and write it. And brother Vijay will be very happy that... ...even for a small thing you didn't ask... ...you only applied for it. Very politely. He will be very happy. He will bless you. - Shall I read it? - No need. You sign here. I am there no. Sign here. Good. Come. Laxmi! Laxmi! Laxmi where are you? What happened? You left the house in a happy mood. Why are you shouting all of a sudden? - Are you well? - Yes my health is okay. Now what ever I say listen carefully. What ever jewellery and silver, brass utensils we have got... ...bring them and keep them here. Yes I will keep them but what is the matter? See this. Read this letter. Read this letter. Why are you so worried about this? Your younger brother has only asked... ...where are my fields located. Yes he asked it no. My brother whom we brought up like our child loved like our son. That son is asking his father, his mother... ...from where his fields start and where they end? He wants to speak his mind in his child's name. As if his child is not related to us. That thankless man doesn't know we have treated him like our son. And he doesn't know that the child whom... ...he thinks is his, is in fact ours. But he himself didn't ask it? Letter is written by some one else he has only signed it. Only signed it. My fields are from where to where. Or divide our wealth. Both are same. There is no difference. Laxmi, our enemies were not so far... ...successful in separating us or dividing our wealth. But today, my own brother succeeded in it. That means you will divide the wealth? There is no other alternative. Otherwise people will say when the younger brother had children... ...elder brother didn't give him anything and kept everything. I will not divide it alone. But I will call the seniors of the village and do it in front of them. I will divide all the things in two parts in front of all the villagers. And will ask him to select one part. Laxmi go and get all the stuff. Bring everything even the glass to drink water. [FOOTSTEPS] Uncle you. What are you doing? Nothing. I am playing with my niece's son. Beware. What is this? Let me take him, I'm in a hurry. Yes you can go. I'll look after him till then. But where you go, look after only my interest. What do you mean? It means you have sent Ravi to stop the division. Now you go there and get it divided. What nonsense you are talking? I'm not talking nonsense. But I am reminding you get it done... - ...or else I will divide this child in two parts. - What? You will kill my child? And you want me to destroy that house which is even better then heaven? I will give my life but I will not do it. How you will not do it? Your one refusal can spoil everything. My men have all the members of that heavenly house at gunpoint. If Ravi refuses for division, first of all your biggest angel will be shot dead. After that Laxmi Devi will be killed. Probably even your Ravi also might get killed. Your one refusal for division will result in loss of many lives. You will get the sin of that. So go and get all the wealth, jewels from there and come straight to me. Till then I will keep this child under my care. Go. I am saying go. Get away from here. What is this? Where are you taking the child? I will get Vijay's house divided because of this child. I will take revenge of my insult. I will take revenge for my son. I will take all the wealth and run away from here. Are you crazy? This is my grandson. This is your grandson. Great. I am also your brother-in-law. When time came you refused to recognize me... ...same way I also refuse to recognize your grandson. You bastard. Let's go. Laxmi... Laxmi... - Yes. - You have kept everything? Listen. Why are you wearing these ornaments? - Take them off. - Yes. Wait! Why are you wearing this Mangalsutra of gold? When I married you, you had only one yellow thread on you. - Take it off. - This... What are you thinking? Take it off. Vijay son, have you called us? Yes Rahim uncle. My younger brother Ravi wants a division of wealth. Ravi and division of wealth? Oh my God. You must be misunderstanding. Ravi can't even think of it. I am telling the truth, Rahim uncle. Ravi wants a division. Apart from him who else will want it? Come brother Ravi, come. Come. Come. I got your letter. I am very happy to read it. In the letter you have written you want to know... ...which are your fields where it starts and where it ends... ...that also for Kishan. But I realized your real intention. - I know it very well. - Brother. I know why you wrote that letter and on whose advise. But it's not your fault. It is my fault. I taught you to be like me. I never let you take a decision on your own. So it is my fault. See I have divided the total wealth in two parts. But brother, I never asked for it. I never meant it. Don't try to fool me. You have only studied college. I have studied life. Life. Come on. Have a look. I have divided everything in two parts. See it properly. Due to anger our chief sees one part as two parts today. Rahim, uncle please go and ask his wife. Laxmi daughter, we can't understand this riddle. Where are the two parts? Rahim uncle, if there were two parts, you would see it. Even I also can't understand it. I'll go and ask him. - Listen, you want the division properly. - Yes. Everyone is puzzled here. You have kept all the things on one side. Nobody knows where are the two parts? There are two parts. Those who have eyes will find two parts. And those who don't have will not find it. Ravi, why are you standing? You select whichever part you want. Rahim uncle, I never wanted division from my brother. But because of somebody's influence, I wrote the letter. This is my fault. Ravi son, Vijay is a very intelligent man. There is definitely some purpose behind all this. Rahim uncle, Rahim uncle. Brother has really done the correct division. An elder brother has for his younger brother... ...kept the property on one side, and himself on the other side. And he is asking me to select one side. This Ram has given... ...one more opportunity to this Laxman to repent. One more opportunity to repent. What is this brother? If the wealth of the entire world is kept on one side against you. I will refuse it and keep my head at your feet. Brother, I will select you. Only you. I don't want wealth, brother. I don't want wealth, brother. I don't want it. I don't want wealth, brother. Enough, Ravi. This wealth is not yours, but mine. I have the right on it. You take this property and stay with your in-laws... ...and your wife and child and live happily. But this wealth is only mine. I will not give any share from it to anyone. This is only my share. Sister-in-law. This is the wealth of my married life. I will take him and go away. - Come. - No sister-in-law. I don't want this house, this land, this property. I don't want anything. I don't want anything. But I want it. We don't want any brother, any sister-in-law any relatives. I want wealth, this house, this land, this property. We will get such brothers. But from where we will get the wealth? Accept this wealth. What nonsense are you talking? Are you in your senses? Yes I am in total senses. I don't want your brother and his wife. I want the wealth. If you have the wealth, then... ...you can get many brothers and sister-in-laws. You shameless! I thought you are like a lotus bloomed in the mud of sins. But you have proved that you are a dirty child of... ...dirty and scoundrel parents. Enough Ravi, enough. I have seen enough of your drama. Now Laxmi and me are not only leaving this house... ...but also this village. All this property and wealth is now yours. - But brother... - Come on Laxmi. Brother. Brother. Brother. Brother wait. You want money? You want money no? Take this. Take this. Take this. And tell the whole world that I have converted... ...this heavenly house into a hell by my crookedness. But remember, from today onwards we have no relations left. You are not my wife. And I am not your husband. Ravi, no. What do you think? Can Lalita burn this house for money? Can I drive angels like brother and sister-in-law out of this house? I am telling you the truth. I swear by you. I swear by our child. If I had not done it, brother and sister would have been killed. - What? - Yes. [JEEP ENGINE REVVING] Come son-in-law. You have brought all the wealth? Yes uncle. I have brought everything to save my child. Take it, and tell me where is my child? I will tell you right now. I will tell you right now. This is your child. [BABY CRYING] Wait, wait, wait. This wealth I have received for that insult... ...which was done by your brother and my crook brother-in-law. But the revenge for my insult you did in the temple... ...in front of all the people is still pending. What do you want? The life of your beloved. Uncle, I am requesting you please give me my child. Shall I give it? If you have the guts take him. Uncle. No son-in-law my heart is very weak. If you raise your hands, I may not be able to hold this. If I drop this, your son will go away from this world. So for my insult... take the beating. Take the beating. And if possible try to save your self. Go on saving them. [BABY CRYING] [GUNSHOT] - [BABY CRYING] - [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] You will earn sin. It is a sin. For raising your hands on your uncle. Son-in-law. Who is it? Save me. Ravi, are you okay? What is happening? Give me my stick. No. Brother-in-law. - Who is brother-in-law? - Snake! - I will break your head with this stick. - Snake! Snake! - Who snake? - Snake! Leave me. Leave me. Leave me. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Brother. Brother. You are leaving everything. But are forgetting the most precious thing with us. Take him with you. Sister, your valuable is with us. Yes brother, Kishan is your son. He is your blood. Why are you leaving him with us? Brother, Lalita has told me everything. Lalita, did you know that Kishan is our child? Yes brother, I knew everything. My child was born dead. I knew, sister came to my bed in the hospital... ...and put her child besides me. I was already conscious by that time. Then tell me when you knew Kishan is our child... ...and when he was sick why did you take him to your mother's house? Because of my mother. Whose mouth knows nothing except, abusing. The whole world thought Kishan was our child. If anything happened to Kishan in your house... ...people would curse my sister, who is like a goddess. They would call her by names like childless, bad omen etc. So, I took Kishan, with me. So, in case anything goes wrong it should happen in my lap. I would get all the blame. [SOBBING] Lalita. Banderlekha. The devil's writing. Where are you running? Where are you running? Hey what is happening here? - Here is your culprit inspector. - Help me. Ask her forgiveness. Beg pardon. Ask her forgiveness. To save your daughter's life this Goddess gave her child to your daughter. And you kept abusing her all your life. You called her bad omen. Childless. Childless is your father. Childless is your husband. That means me. Vijay son, a woman is responsible for making a man a human, a God, or a devil. Like this Goddess. You are great. For your greatness, this Goddess is responsible. If a woman wishes she can make a house a hell. If she wishes, she can make it better then heaven. She is responsible to a great extent. Inspector if my brother-in-law is the root of all is. Then my wife is the mud of it. And I have fallen in that mud. Take us all to the prison. But keep us in separate cells. Otherwise we will make the prisoners fight among them. And if possible forgive me. It is not possible. Come on. He wants pardon. Stupid. My dear... Please forgive me also. I will keep my mouth shut. Come on, on behalf of the boss I am forgiving you. - What? - Just saying. Okay, if you keep your promise. I will see. Shall I forgive her? - Yes. - Yes, yes. Yes. See, be ashamed. This is called angels. I have forgiven you. Go stand back. [GIGGLING] "This year... after many years." "This year... after many years." "The season to live and die has come."
