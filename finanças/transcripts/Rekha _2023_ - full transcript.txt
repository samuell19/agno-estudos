If you say you want to study, there's no need to work, right? Look at all this mess! How will you all survive if I die? Hey, you! Wake up! I have never seen a girl like her anywhere! My fate! Hey! Go away, stupid crow! Such a fearless crow! We had a dog for these things. What happened to it? Someone poisoned it. I know who that was. What is your mom muttering about? She started early morning! She couldn't sell the eggs, maybe. Don't bother me. Can you make hens lay eggs? Then I'll do one thing. I'll walk behind it, checking for eggs. Will you go to work and earn money? - What do you want... - Am I not working as well? My hardships have no value here! Did I ask you to work in this condition? If she wasn't here, I would've given you the apt reply! I'm going, Dad. You can say what you like. Shutting me up is your priority, right? I've firmly asked you to not buy hens from the neighbors. Who'll listen to me here? How could I know that it would lay eggs in their homes? - Be careful. Don't poke. - Okay. You continue. That Praseeda's hen sleeps in our cage every night. It's always seen with our hens, but lays eggs only in her home. Well, that's why we bought it, right? And then? Our hen also joined in, laying eggs at her place. Four hundred rupees down the drain! - Can't we ask for our money back? - Yes, as if she'll return it! She once asked for my coat for two days. It's been two years now! When I asked, she's like, "Oh! I thought I returned it…" Leave it. - At least they give us water to drink. - Then write off your land to them. Shouldn't we give them the money for eleven eggs? Why should we? It's our hen. The eggs are ours. They used our cock for that. And then selling it back to me? Out of that, four were rotten. Did you notice the other seven? You saw the ring around their necks? Just like our cock. God! I hope no one goes through this kind of a situation! It's true. There is a "misalliance". Hello. Why do I have a missed call from you? I tried to call you. I asked you not to call. Because you didn't call. Everyone else did. Oh… Hey, Praseeda! - You there? Hello? - Praseeda! - What? - Had tea? At noon? What's today? - Did your uncle die? - That was today? Dumbo, it's my birthday today! - Go call your girlfriend that! - That's what I did. Can't you at least wish me? I'm bad at remembering dates. Now you remember, right? Wish me. Nope. - You can give gifts, okay? - Come fast, I've packed it. - I'll come, okay? - Oh, yeah! - I'll see you. - Alright, hang up. Oh, God! What was that sound? Don't worry. The vessel fell inside. What's with you? How will we get it out? God! What do I do?! To wish you on your birthday... No, dear. Would you have married me if I were a rich guy from Dubai? I was serious. Come on! You said your father wanted to marry you off soon as he was ill, - and hence we should break up. - That was true. Your "ill" father came to our house yesterday to climb the coconut tree. My father was seriously ill back then. Don't lie, dear. To hell with your birthday wish! So I shouldn't call on your birthday? Only insurance company reps call me on my birthday of late. - That's enough. - Truly, I didn't dump you. What should I have done when my father's health was bad? Stop it. I don't like this marriage. Do you know one thing? - That you still love me a lot? I know it. - You… Get lost. Hello! Hello, Jayan? You there? Why are you here? Did your father Kunjikannan buy the shop? Then why are you here? Where's Arjun? Today is my birthday. Came to buy chocolates for the kids. Arjun took my bike and went. I'll bring your bike. Go home. - Don't hang around with him. - I just came to buy sweets. You heard what I said! Tell him that as well. Happy birthday! Get lost! What's wrong? Give me a chocolate worth 20 rupees. Come on, lower it. What are you doing? Give it to him. Okay. Hey, get down! - Don't hurt yourself! - Give it to me as well. Satheesh, have this. Only drinks? No snacks? - I was planning to ask you this. - Have it. What's your age? I'm young. Rekha and I were classmates. Maybe even a little younger than me. So, no snacks? Do you have biscuits at your aunt's? Give it. - Why are you in a hurry? - Move. - Well, my calculations are going wrong. - Please hold this. - Pull it properly, dude. - Where are you going? I'm going to get biscuits. Take the already opened packet. Are they dog biscuits? We also eat that. Did you pull the vessel out? After that will you take one from my well as well? What's your age, mate? - He doesn't know to go down in a well. - Please keep quiet. - Hello? - Hello. - Hello? - Hello. I've told you not to call unless I give you a missed call. What if I do otherwise? Dear, what did you tell you'd give me if I came here? Why did you come here now? Oh! Give me what you told me you would… You devil! Go away. Someone will see you. I came to see you. Your dog died? Aren't you parents outside? So what? So… I want a kiss. A kiss?! Get out of here! I'm serious. I want a kiss, or I won't leave. As if you'll get it from me! Give… You are getting on my nerves. You're a liar! Now go! I want one on the lips, not cheek. You'll surely get it! I'm going now, or else mom will come here. - Please. Stay with me. Just one kiss. - Mom will see us. - Dear… - Don't make a scene. - I'm trembling here. Go. - Please. - Just one kiss, dear. - I'll call you. I'm going. Satheesh! What's going on? A necklace belonging to Rekha has fallen in the well. - Necklace? - Unbelievable! Hey, we got the vessel! If you have some self-respect, get out by hit wicket. That's out! Who's up there? Your uncle? Pass the bat, mate. Jayan, come here. Where is your vehicle? - It's there. - Pass the ball! Are you going home, Uncle? Your vehicle has been near Rajan's home for quite some time now. Are you in love with Rajan's daughter? What rubbish! Who is telling you all these stories? Gopalan knows everything. You need to stop it. She's not fit for you. Stop what? There is nothing to stop. Then why is your vehicle always in front of her house? The bike has diarrhea! Dude! Hey, Jayan! Get lost! - Come back to the field, mate! - Jayan! - Go away! - Get lost, man! - Dad, I'm leaving. - Okay, dear. Where are you going at this late hour? - You asked me to buy tea powder. - At this time? The vessel fell earlier when I was about to leave. Plus, my vehicle has headlights. - There's no point in speaking to you! - Let dad come out. You could have gone and come back home instead of staying here to quarrel! Dad, I'll buy snacks with the balance money. Okay, dear. You both are unbelievable! Did you even ask her how the vessel fell? Didn't you take your tablet today? I'm leaving this place. - Ayyappan… - Yes? - Didn't you go to work today? - I did. - How's life? - Just going with the flow. - Any family issues? - Nope. - What was the scene there? - Nothing much. - Hello? Where are you? - At the shop. - I'm coming there. - Yeah, come. Is your dad there? Yes, but don't worry. I'll figure something. Is it difficult, talking over the phone? - I'm coming there. - Okay. - What happened, dear? - Nothing, just a call. Hello, where are you? At home. Don't lie to me, Jayan. I've been trying to call you for a while. Your phone was busy. Where are you now? Inside the stove. Get lost, dude! What happened? Your brother is retarded. Do you know who she is? - Lakshman's daughter. - Oh, that's her?! - What do you want? - Do you have tea powder? - Loose or packet? - How much for a packet? The rate varies. Isn't it for home? Give her Kannan Devan. Okay. What else? What will you do with it? I'll fry it at home. Of course, you will! What else? These. How many? Five. Eat slowly, kid. Don't gobble it down. How much? Never mind. - Take it. - Keep it. - Leave me. - Take the balance. You dog! She looks like a guy! She studies in some sports school, right? She finished the course. Now she's preparing for PSC exams. If girls go for sports activities, the family's pride will stoop. True that! Maybe it's because she's the only child. Have it. I've been hearing rumors about Savitha's affairs. Something's going on with her. - Is it true? - That's on her husband Lakshman it seems. I'm observing her theatrics, when she comes here. So what I heard is true? There is no smoke without fire, right? Where are you going? I'll be around. Is he still unemployed? Shouldn't he also show some interest? There's no use in talking about it. There should be some luck as well. Dear… Rajan! Rajan! Hey, Gopalan! It's been long since I saw you. I had been planning to come over, but I didn't get the time to. - Is Rajan home? - Yes. He's bathing. Oh, okay. I'll come later. That's alright. You can come inside and wait. - He'll be right out. - Who's there? It's me! Gopalan, the member! Hey, Gopalan! Long time no see. What's the news? Don't say that. I'm a member. Don't say that you haven't seen me in a long time! How's it going? Any luck in politics? Yes. Scraping through. How are you? Getting better. I'm working more often now. I've been panting a lot, but what can be done? Rajan, can anyone in this village match your skills at work? Oh, well... Does Sundaran's son Sanish dehusk more coconuts? But people who want you, will certainly call you. What about your trees? Yeah, soon. It's infested with mites. - Where's your daughter? - She has gone to the shop. Did she finish her studies? She went somewhere out of station, right? Yeah, that's done. She's preparing for PSC now. There she is! - Hi, dear. - Hey! She's a big girl now of marriageable age. She doesn't want that right now. You see, kids nowadays are reluctant to get married. And later, they won't get grooms! It is my decision to marry after I get a job. That's good. It's better that way. A job is always a support for girls. Don't you have any political activities to do? Yes. I'm a member, right? - Will you rise to power this time? - This time, for sure! Rajan, I came here to discuss a serious matter. What's that? Nothing much. Just wanted to ask you, how many cents is this house and the plot? This must be… - Twelve cents, maybe. - Oh, twelve! It's nothing. I just asked. Sure! I have headweight! That's what I said. You as well as your dad and uncle! Okay! What's with you? What? I want a kiss. Come here. I'll give you one. I'll really come, okay? Okay. I surely will! Come. Asu's mom is next door. What? Elephant's egg! I don't understand. It's super tasty. Which leaf is this? - You don't have to know. Just eat. - Kiddo! - Was that a joke? - What is it? - Hey! - Yes? You're always on your phone! I'll destroy it! That's what I've been saying, but you never listen to me. She's Dad's little princess after all! Why are you pestering me? You want to know which leaf this is? Stinging nettle. - Well, I thought so. - Come on! Don't lie! Oh, electricity has been restored! Even if we cook jackfruit and tell him it's Chinese potato, he'll believe us! Come on, girl. Did you eat? Yes. Did you? Yes. What was the curry? Chicken curry. What else do you want, bourgeoisie? Hey, I told you... - You glutton! You ate up everything! - Dad! Dad! What will you eat along with puttu tomorrow? I'll eat it with sugar. Sugar… There are no snacks left in this house! You eat up everything! Are you pregnant?! - Yeah. I'll call you when my water breaks. - Yeah, I'll come then. You don't have to come. I'll call you. You are always on the phone! I swear, I'm going to burn it one day! She left! Where do you keep going? I'm here! Are you on another chat? Elephant's egg! I wanna see you. We just met sometime back. We shouldn't meet often. Why? We'll have feelings. What feelings? Elephant's egg! Tell me. How do I put it in words? Shall I tell you then? Oh, come on. Shut up! I wanna see you. How will you? Shall I come over? No way. You're unbelievable. Let's do a video call. Everybody's here. They didn't sleep yet. Okay then. Bye. Angry? I'll call. Just keep quiet. Okay. Come on! Dad. - How big is our house in square feet? - What happened? I'm just asking. Tell me. It's 1110 square feet. Is it really that much? What's your problem? Nothing. Why are you out here? Get inside. Oh, it's too hot inside. You go to bed. Yes. That's why I said that the vastu is not correct. Raghavan, the carpenter, did the foundation works, you know? Oh… elephant's egg! You know, the member Gopalan who came over earlier? Yes? I think he came with a proposal for you. - Who is the groom? - I have no idea. I don't know whether he came to see our plot. I can't figure it out because his questions were similar. Maybe. I'm going. Get inside, Dad. You go to bed. This is comfortable for me. - Do you want paan? - No. I don't wanna spit all night. - Who's gonna give it to you anyway? - Get inside and sleep, Dad. Well… - Are you gone? - I won't go that easily, babe! Why did you tell lies?! Your eyes will break open, you monkey! - Fine. I'll just hang up. - I was joking. There's no need to makes jokes. What are you doing? - What? - What? - You know, there's an actress… - Who? I don't know her name. Forget it. Leave it. I'm gonna sleep now. What? Let's not sleep tonight. - I'll go when I'm sleepy. - That's when you feel sleepy, right? You lie down first. Lie down? Why? To wash clothes. Such a lame joke! Lie down. Okay. Now what? - What else? - What? I didn't turn the lights off. Mom will scold me. - How old are you? - I'm younger than you! I'm of marriageable age. Let me settle down first. Then I'll marry you. Find a job first. - I don't want a job, dear. - You need one. I'm trying. Let's see. Listen, I had a dream. - What was it? - Our wedding. - What comes after the wedding? - What comes after it? - What all can we see after the wedding? - What? The reception? - Your uncle's head! - I got what you meant. - Our first night... - You and your desires! - Can't we see a dream after marriage? - No. - What was the dream about? - I can't tell all that. It won't come true. Tell me. If we speak about it, it won't come true. That's okay. Tell me. - You have no problem? - Well, yes, I do. - Then I won't tell you. - Oh, God! Give me strength. - What's with you, idiot? - That's your father! - Don't say that about my father! - I was talking about my father-in-law. Dear… - Remove the blanket. - No, I'm cold. - Really?! - Yeah. Why? Remove it. Alright. What now? One minute. Where did you go? - What are you doing? - Nothing. Nothing? You have no plan to find a job? Let me land one first. Well, it won't come to you. - Tell me something else. - What else do I say? Lie straight. What do you mean? On your side. Why? Please. I'm getting angry. Why? Don't say such things. So, I don't have the right to speak to you like this? I thought we were open with each other. - Hey! Turn off the lights and sleep! - Oh, God! Let's talk tomorrow. - Bye. Go. - Bye. It's too hot here. Where are you going at this late hour? To urinate! Should I refrain from that as well? Are you angry? Come on, man! Sorry. I said sorry. What else should I do? Open your door. What? Open the door before someone wakes up. Open! Leave! - Go! - Don't worry. No one saw me. - My dad is outside. - He is snoring. - Why are you here? - Don't make a noise. Please go. There is no other way for us to talk. I'll leave in a while. Why do you want to talk? - I'm trembling with fear. - Hey, you're scaring me. Dear, I opened the shop and got this for you. Now get going. - What the hell? - Please keep quiet. Why are you sitting there? I'll go. You sit and eat it. Chew slowly. - How did you open the door? - It wasn't locked. Dad didn't lock the door as he was sleeping outside. That makes it easy for thieves. What's here to see anyway? You! What do I have? Do you have nothing? I have a necklace. What value does it hold compared to you? Nice one. I'm flattered. I was serious. Can you give me a bite? What bite? Of the snack! I don't mind even if it's some other bite! I do mind. Alright. Don't throw it and make a sound. Give it in my hand. I will. But don't touch me. As if you are God! I can't touch you?! What's with your attitude? I knew you would hold my hand. - Leave me. - Why did you come? I was just trying to give you the snack. - Please… - Come sit. - Leave me. - Sit. - Let go… - Sit. - Come on! - Just sit. - Did that hurt? - Get lost. - So, what everybody says is true. - What? That you are super strong. I'm only as strong as other girls. Strong girl! Why are you sitting away? Nothing. Should I leave? I didn't say so. Hey… - I thought you were angry. - No. See that trophy? - Yes. - I won that. - What happened to your dad's eye? - He had an accident when he was little. Any new proposal for your sister? Dear… - shall I give you a kiss? - No, I don't want one. Don't you like me? No. It's not that. Let's talk about something else. Then what is it? Please. Just one kiss. Come on. Please. I'm really scared. Please. Just one kiss. Please. Just one kiss. My heart is beating so fast that it might blast. Dear… See how fast it's beating. Really fast. Do you feel the same way? What? Then? Then what? What if we sit closer? On the cheek. You don't want it? I'm scared. Me too. Enough? Please. That's enough. No. Just one kiss. Please. Arjun… I can feel something. I should say that. You scratched my neck! Get lost! It's good that Chikku is no more. Or else, he would've barked so much! - Shall I ask you something? - Yeah. Did you do something to Chikku to kill him? Why? Tell me the truth. I drugged the sweet and fed it. He always barked at me. And I wanted to come over to see you. What harm did the dog do that you killed him? I'm sorry. I did it so that I could visit you. Sorry. - Shall I go? - Yeah. You normally wake up early. What happened today? Come on, wake up! It's late! Why won't you say anything? Narayanan! Please come here! He won't wake up! - Dear! - What happened? Dear! Come here! Dad is not waking up! Narayanan, please wake him up! - Why won't he respond?! - What's wrong? - What happened to him?! - What's wrong? - Oh, God! - Rajan! - Rajan! - Oh, God! What am I going to do?! - Rajan! Open your eyes! - Dear! Dad is not waking up! Oh, God! Oh, God! Why won't he wake up?! Oh, my! What happened? Get up, sister. Have some water. Dear… Change and come fast. Give me that. Do you have any thoughts after seeing the body? - What thoughts? - No, right? - No. - Maybe it was my doubt. Don't blabber around. Come on, hand me that. Give me that. There's dirt on the body. Move. Oh, God! - Dear God! - Calm down! - Please calm down. - Hey… Pull yourself together. Please come here. Dear… Please call your dad, dear! Dear! Wake him up! Dear! Sister… - They won't be carrying out a postmortem. - There's no need. Then should we wait with the body? Twelve o'clock, right? I'll be there. Okay. What happened? Heart attack. He was sleeping outside. He was found dead this morning. He had a heart attack a few months ago. He has had an operation too. - Is the postmortem done? - No. I don't think so. I came to call him for work. - For dehusking? - Yeah. - How much would you give? - Ninety paisa. Ninety paisa? Oh, God! My brother! Is that his sister? What is it? I don't know if this is the right time to tell you, but I know what you are going through. Uncle will be with you, come what may. Don't make me hurl abuses at you in front of a mourning family. - What happened? - Nothing. What's wrong? The number you have called is busy. Please call after some time. The number you have called is busy. Please call after some time. The number you are calling is currently switched off. Please call back later. The number you are calling is currently switched off. Please call back later. I told you so many times not to let him sleep alone outside… and that someone should always be with him. It's a very bad society. What would you do if thieves break in? There's nothing in this house for thieves to take. I would always tell him not to sleep outside. She'd always tell him too, but he'd never listen. He'd always blame the hot weather and sleep outside. What could we do? I couldn't even talk to him or give him a glass of water… before he breathed his last. Why didn't you call for a postmortem? His body already had stitches while he lived. I didn't want him to be cut opened. Not just that. Is there any man to run behind all these things? Right! When Sumesh came over with a proposal, Rekha was angry. Dear… Rice flakes. What else? Where's Arjun? Why? He is not here. Where did he go? Tell me what the matter is. Give me his number. No. What's the matter? The number you have called is busy. Please call after some time. The number you have called is busy. Please call after some time. He left today. He called me early in the morning when I was asleep! - He took a bus to Kottayam. - To Kottayam? This is such a bad time for me. The other day, my uncle blabbered something to me. And yesterday, his father Peetambaran got angry at me. - As if I'm the one who spoiled him! - Spoiled him? What is the matter with him? Where is he? Did he tell you something? No. He just asked me to lend him 500 rupees, which I did. That's about it. Give me his number. He didn't take his phone. His dad told me. You should leave from here before someone sees you. - I want to see him. - Well, go on. Are you both in love? Is there a problem? I just want to see him. He got in an Ernakulam bus. He doesn't have friends there. Arjun's uncle works as a security guard there. So, that's where he should be. What's his name? Kannan. Should we come with you? We can solve any problem. And visit Lulu Mall as well. Give me his uncle's number, and go there with your parents. I don't have his number. Aunty! Aunty! Is this Kannan's house? Yes. Who are you? Is Kannan here? He is in Ernakulam. Why? Where in Ernakulam? What's the matter? He promised me a job there. Aren't you the late Rajan's daughter? He himself doesn't have a proper job. He lied to you. Where is he now? In a theater complex. Sita… Sridhar or something. Arjun is there too, right? Please give his number. I don't have it. Please leave. I want his number. Please. I can't sleep. He's suffering from memory loss. Also he has been sleep-walking. The other day, he left home at 3:00 a.m. When I asked him where he had gone, he replied, "I went to school." We always need to keep an eye on him. Can't say when he leaves the house! I've been thinking about all this and having sleepless nights. People say that I've been yapping away because of lack of sleep. Aren't you Sudhakaran's daughter? Aren't you? It's been a long time since you came. Speak. I never… I never wanted a relationship. All my friends were in a relationship. So… I also desired to have one. Then I met Arjun. He always smiled at me. Soon he proposed to me. We became friends. We got into a relationship. He came over to my house. Go on. I can't sleep. My dad… My… My dad died recently. I think I'm the reason it happened. I still can't believe it. Keep going. You have doubts in your mind, right? Speak. Shouldn't we clear the doubts? Talk to me. Mom… I'm going to Ernakulam. Where?! Don't give people reasons to cook up stories. Get inside! - I'm going. - Hey! Where are you going?! Get inside! Where do you think you're going?! Get back here! Mom called many times. I told her that you are with me. What is the matter? I'll be here for a few days. Did someone ditch you? Yes. I have roommates. If they ask, tell them that you're here in search of a job. - Greeshma! - Yes? - Please take that key and helmet. - Okay. Hold this. You go inside. Finish the work soon. What? TEA Try to finish and leave early. Brother… Isn't that Kannan? Uncle Kannan? I don't know whether he's Uncle Kannan. But his name is Kannan. My daughter told me about your father's demise. We had our fights, but... What did you hear? What? What did you hear about my father? Aren't you the daughter of Rajan, who died of a heart attack? Where is Arjun? Why are you asking about him? I want to see him. Did he do something wrong to you? I want to talk to him. He has been like this since childhood. Do you know how Arjun's father Peetambaran lost his eye? You know Suma? The woman who lived near his shop? She was very beautiful. Arjun's father sneakily took a peek at Suma while she was bathing. Suma noticed and poked him with a stick. Peetambaran was like that since his childhood. Arjun is the same. Am I right? What did he do to you, dear? Did he rape you? Does he have any video of you? Tell me. I will solve your problem. I want to see him. Don't discuss these matters here. My shift ends at five o'clock. Do one thing. I live just around the corner. You come there around six o'clock. I'll freshen up and wait for you. I'll call Arjun too. He also lives nearby. We'll talk it out and come to an understanding. I'll help you resolve all your problems. Don't worry, dear. I'll make him delete the video. Trust me. Okay? Oh! You're here early. It's just 5:15 p.m. I had called him. I didn't tell him anything about you. He said he'd come after 6:00 p.m. - He has a job. - Where? He'll be coming here. What did he do to you? When will he come? He'll come soon. Tell me, what happened? Like you said earlier… Rape. Are you… pregnant? I see. He left his home after finding out that he impregnated you. It's a pity! Your dad might have known this, right? Maybe that's why he suffered a heart attack! Right? So, pregnancy is the main issue. We can solve that. You lie down on this bed. Allow me to check. I'll close the door. Even if it's just going to be Arjun, he'll be upset if he sees us. Come, lie down. Let me check how much it has grown. Don't worry, dear. Your father and I were friends. Let me see. Come, dear. You are very strong. I love girls who are strong. Come. Oh! You've got tricks! Leave my hand. Bitch! Bitch! No! You bitch! Leave me! Bitch! I'll kill you! I'll kill you… What did Arjun do to you? He is not my relative. What did he tell you? He told me that he wanted a job as he was caught having an affair in his village. What? He told me that he had an affair with a teacher named Savitha. Is your name Savitha? The pain is excruciating! Where is he working? At a nearby hotel. - Where is he staying? - There itself, along with the workers. What do you want? Close the window and leave. Did you call him? He'll come. Come inside. Have some tea. Come in, you son of a bitch! Get in and close the door. What happened to your phone? It fell in water. Did you hear about my father's death? - Yes. - How did you know? Did you find out or did someone tell you? What do you want now? I just want to know what happened that night. What do you mean, dear? Asshole! My father caught me red-handed that night. So, he threw me out. I didn't have my phone. So, you have no role in my father's death? Right? No. You didn't do anything to him? Hey! Dear, wait! Dear! I asked because they found blood stains on your clothes. Why didn't you tell me earlier? What should I tell? That I don't know how my father died? Maybe he suffered a heart attack after seeing me immersed in thoughts. Or… maybe it happened in his sleep. Or… I don't know whether he did something to my dad. What should I tell you? I don't know. What if he lied? Then shouldn't I kill him? He may have friends here. You'll be in trouble. I'll deal with whoever tries to stop me. Are you going to thrash them? Can't I? If he's responsible… I will make him pay. He came to my house and… If it's true that he killed my father, I swear on my dead father, I will make him pay. I won't spare him. I've been trying for long. Where were you? I was washing clothes. So, you're finally missing your family! It's been days since you last called. You're roaming around when you're supposed to be conducting rituals here! Uncle came over yesterday. He spoke a lot. He also had a proposal for you. So, the rituals won't affect that? Get lost! I don't want to answer your silly questions. Do you have that teacher Savitha's phone number? - She hung herself this morning. - What?! She hung herself this morning, but she didn't die on the spot. She died on the way to the hospital. She was nothing like I thought she was. She was having an affair with a guy. Her husband found out about her doings. It became a big issue. That's why she committed suicide. Who was the guy? Why? And why do you want her number? So… she didn't tell anybody who it was? What are you saying?! Would anyone disclose that? Why do you want her number? I wanted to know a thing. What thing? - Cut the call. - Of course, I should! - Hello? - Hello. Is this Jayakrishnan? It's me. Yes, tell me. Move aside. - You know that teacher named Savitha? - Yes. How did she die? She hung herself. Did she say something? She had an affair. I have no idea who the guy was. When her husband returned after work, he saw someone sneaking out of the house. He already had doubts. People were saying many things. Didn't her husband see who the guy was? He couldn't see the face clearly. Why? Jayakrishnan… do you doubt anyone? No, I don't. - Alright. Bye. - Bye. The number you are calling is currently switched off. Please call back later. The number you are calling is currently switched off. Please call back later. - Sure. - One cup of tea. Tea for that table. Give me the tea, brother. It's for us. Bro! Come on, man! - I'm not your goddamn pet! - It's okay! - How dare you! - Vinu! - I'm not your pet! - What? - Hey! Stop it! - Leave him! - Who the heck are you? I won't spare you! - Stop it! Why do you employ such people here? - Move! Go away! - Leave me. - Let go! - Stop it! - Get lost! - How dare you push me, asshole! Stupid employees! Move aside! Hey, you… Come on! Let's settle it outside! Don't hide in there! - Go away! - I'll wait for you. Vinu! What? What did she study at the sports school? There were a few problems at the office. But then I figured things out. Now it's all good. Hello? Can't you hear me, Arjun? Tell me. I'm going back home. I wanna see you before that. You saw me already. Isn't that enough? I want to speak to you in person. I'm going home too. We'll meet then. Shall I come to your room? Behind that temple at Thammanam. What do you want?! I just want to meet you. When? At the earliest. Then let's meet now? Sure. Where should I come? Why do you want to see me? Why are you frightened? I'm not. Why should I be frightened? I'll be there. Come to Penta. I'll be there. At this hour?! Why do you want to meet? Come to Penta. That's the only place I know. Eleven o'clock. Eleven o'clock. Okay. I'll come. Finish this up. Hey! Hello? Where are you? I'll reach soon. I'm here. I'm coming. You better stop this. I told you that I'm unaware of your dad's death. Did you hear about the teacher Savitha's death? The police are looking for you. This is also about my dad's case. Tell me the truth. I have nothing to say. What? I have nothing to say! You called me here for this?! I want to know. There is nothing to know. I don't know anything. Hey, Arjun! Hey! Hey! If you don't tell me the truth, I'll tell the police. I want to know. I want to sleep in peace. Arjun, I have understood everything. There's no need to lie. It wasn't me. It just happened. What happened? Savitha's case. What about my dad? It wasn't me! I don't know. I didn't do anything. I'm sleepy. I'm going. I know what you did to my dad. What did I do? If you are that sure, then prove it. You cremated him, right? Nothing remains! Go on and prove it's me. You… I know you killed my dad! Yes. What? Yes. What? Yes. Did you kill my dad? Yes! Showing your strength in front of a man? Your strength… You think you are stronger than your dad? Why are you here? Get out of my house. I'll be talking to your father. Go away! What can I do if people are like this? Dad… Do you want to die like your dad? Stop it. Just stop it. I don't want to make the same mistake that I made with your dad. Don't utter a word. I won't spare you. Have you ever held a knife like I've held one in the kitchen? Come on, kill me! What did you think? You thought I'd sit idle in kitchen, after you fuck me and kill my dad?! Get lost! Arjun… Arjun… I miss him a lot. My dad. Hey, Arjun. Savitha didn't even mention you till her last breath. Do girls really love you that much? What about you? Don't make a sound, or else the cops will come. Arjun, my dad once asked me if I was in a relationship. I said no. We weren't in a relationship, right? We probably got into this only because all my friends were in a relationship. For you it was sex, whereas for me it was something I could show off. Tell me one thing. Did you sleep with me right after killing my dad? Or… did you kill him after we… had sex? - Do you know Arjun? - Which Arjun? That shopkeeper's son. Yes, I do. I'm sure you know about the murder of a teacher named Savitha. Upon checking Savitha's phone, we found out that Arjun was the real reason. He's absconding. When we asked the villagers about him, they told us that you also inquired about him. That's not it. We found your name as well in his call list. Arjun and I were in a relationship. I never thought he'd turn out to be a cheat. - I looked for him when he went missing. - You went to Ernakulam to look for him? Yes, I did. We spoke and settled everything. So, you don't know where he is? Arjun is a big fraud. Don't keep anything from us just because he's your lover. What happened to your hand? I'm a girl. It happened while doing chores in the kitchen. What about your face? I hurt myself while cutting open a nut. - What's your name? - My name? Rekha. Rekha Rajendran.
