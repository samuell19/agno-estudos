Get lost now. You've played enough. Wait. Come here. Panayotis. Panayotis, stop. Andrei? You got my photos? Forget it. I'm with the kid. I got to go. Can I call someone too? Who do you want to call? My friend Fragiskos. -Do you know his number? -Yes. Here. Panayotis! Come back. Panayotis, stop! What a nice breeze. See? The countryside is not all bad. It's not funny. Come on, you know, it's temporary. Did we hit it? No. It's fine. No, Mom. So what? Tell Dad. I don't care. Yeah, OK. Bye now. -Hello. -Hello. Mom, look what I found. How is my baby? Good. -Have you eaten? -Yes. Look. -What is it? -A sword. Dad, look what Panayotis found. Nice. -I'll go get cigarettes. -Me too! -I thought you'd given up. -A last pack. -Let's go. -Take Panayotis with you. I'll make it quick and then we'll play together, OK? Do you need me tomorrow? Yes, all week, same time. Right. Bye. -Thanks. -Bye, Panayotis. Bye. Come on. Your horse is ready. Let's go. You took your time. Flat tire. You took the car? Yes. For cigarettes? Yes. I hope you didn't smoke in the car. No. Either tidy up those, or get rid of them. You'll see, it's better for the kid, to grow up in nature. Especially in a house like this, if you decide to buy it. Your husband? What? We could make another appointment, for him to see it too. That won't be necessary. He trusts me completely. Naturally. You seem to be a woman of taste. Do you prefer this house to the previous one? Yes. But the other one was nice too. If you told me your criteria, I could serve you better. What is it you don't like? I will know the right place when I see it. -A man of many talents. -How did you get in? It was open. Do you like me? Nice. It suits you. Aliki! -Get out. -Jump in, too. Aliki, get out. Why, aren't you talented in this too? No! Sorry. What are you doing? I forgot. I'll go take a shower. We said seven. -We had work, Lita. -And I had a date. You could have called at least. You live across the street anyway. Ms. Aliki explained, we had work to do. For the past week. Thanks. I'll go to Anna's. Better connection there. Yes, it's better. I'm sure this time it'll work out. We'll see. -No kiss? -Sit in the living room armchair. Good luck. -Yes. -You realize that? Of course. International experience is essential for us. No problem. I understand. If a new opening comes up, we'll call. Yes, of course. I hope there will be other opportunities. All right. I'll keep your CV on file. Thanks. Pleasure. -Me too. -Good luck. Have a good day. Where were you? I tried to call you. I didn't hear it. How was your Skype? Nothing yet. Where is this company? Athens. Maybe you should have gone there. I'm sorry. You know best. Come on. Sit down. I'll go change. No, let's go out. I'll go wake up Panayotis. Come on, Dad. Come on. Come on. Swim! Use your feet. Take me where my boat goes. Come on. Let's go to Dad. Corner! I'll get it. I'm gonna eat you... So... Here. And go! I'll get it. Panayotis? I'll find you and cook you for supper. Panayotis! -Are you OK? -Yes! Show me. Come on. Let's go home. Wait. Ten more minutes. We went to get breakfast. Come on, my babies. Jane, Oliver! Come! Come here. Oliver! Stay! Stay! I am the wife of Petros. I am sorry. I must have scared you. You have. I wasn't expecting... I was helping Petros today and... Oliver. You are... Marina, right? Aliki. Of course. Petros told me your name, but I forgot it. Sorry. A nurse, right? Anesthesiologist. -Really? -Yes. Could you please help me with these? Thank you. Where is Petros? He was here, but he had to leave. Actually, I have to go too. Petros told me you have a little boy. For the kid. Thanks. Do you have a car, or shall I call for a taxi? Or I can give you a lift? I prefer to walk, thank you. As you wish. Do you mind taking the garbage on your way out? Thank you. Oliver, come here. Here's a good boy. Mr. Stratos, we have to make sure you don't get any bedsores. Cigarette! Impossible, given your respiratory condition. I'm sorry, but I need your cooperation on this. Can I bum a cigarette off you? Thanks. Thank you. -Please wrap this up for us. -Sure. -Panayotis, will you finish this? -No. Maybe I should speak to my mother. Last time I let you wear it like this. You'll be strangled in your sleep. I won't be strangled. You will! No... You will. -No, you! -You. Go to sleep now. When are we going back? -Back where? -To Athens. We'll see. Now go to sleep. Can I call Fragiskos? It's late. Close your eyes now. Maybe we should clear the balcony and paint it. I want to paint too. You should play with your toys. You're too young for painting. He can help if he wants. I wanna play football again at the other house. That's enough my dears. Get back. Now. You should fix this, it jams. Yes, I plan to. Sorry. I'm being rude. -Come in. -Thanks. How come you dropped by? Just to check that everything is alright. Thank you. Very kind of you. Could you check the pool filter, now that you're here? The water is strange. Of course. A very charming couple used to live in this house. Unfortunately they got divorced. They say that she fell for another man. We are one big family here. People talk. The owner is a charming woman. The big plus is the furniture. Selected with taste. I like your taste for beauty. And... Where is this house? On the hill. You've been here before? No. But I'm not sure I like this place. It's a highly appreciated neighborhood. You really must see it. We're lucky, the owner is there today. No need to disturb her. I'm not interested. Are you sure? -Pity, we're almost there. -I'm sure. As you wish. I'm sorry. Did I scare you? Yes. I dozed off. Are you done? Yes. Good. Thanks, I won't be needing anything else. And you? What? Is there something you want? No. Have a good day. Make sure you close the gate, Oliver keeps escaping. Easy now. Easy now. Easy. Please, be patient. I'll get you a painkiller. Do you want to take a shot? Aliki. It's your turn. Come on. Look here. All the pretty little horses will come to you in your dream and will take you on a ride. Mommy will be there too. Will we go tomorrow to play football? OK. Go to sleep now. Come on. -Goal. -Go on. You don't know how to play. -Did you see that shopping list? -Yes, thanks. We're out of beer. She's not bad, Anna. Not bad. For her age. Get down right now and go to your room. What happened? He broke the bed. He was jumping on it. It's only a board that shifted. I'll fix it. Like you fixed the gate? Stop it, Aliki. I always liked that mole. Maybe we can stay here for good. Here? Yes. How? I don't know. We'll see. Yeah. We'll see. Aliki? Petros... Nadia! -Long time no see! -How are you, Nadia? Very well. Little Panayotis, he's grown so much! -How are you? -Good. Panayotis, do you remember Ms. Nadia, the mom of Miltos and Sofia? -Yes. -Kostas is here too. How are you, guys? -Fine. And you? -What's up? Panayotis. -What's up, little man? -Fine. How he's grown! It's been months, guys! How are you doing? Good. Everything is fine. What are you guys doing here? I'm building a villa here for a client and I came to supervise. Petros, how are you doing? Good. Here. It's nice here. Yes. It is. Shall we go out for dinner tonight? We're leaving tomorrow. Why don't you come over for dinner with us? Good idea. Kostas? With pleasure. -Great. I'll send you directions. -OK. I am so glad we'll catch up. -See you tonight, then. -Yes. Bye. Bye Panayotis. -Bye. -Bye. The second door on the left. How beautiful. The house is really lovely. Thanks. I am jealous of your bathroom. Everything is so neat! What were you saying? I was telling him about your job. You must be happy with it. I told him about your job at the health clinic. Yes, it's OK. And you, Petros, what are you up to? I have many good clients here. I could manage your account too. What kind of clients do you have? -How do you mean? -Locals, or from Athens? Both. I should introduce you to Antonis, my client here. With pleasure. -He's CEO of a bank. -Great, Petros could... Kostas knows what I could do, Aliki. Yes. Right. Here's to what we could, then. Kostas, I may need your help. I have some ideas for the house. For example? You know how it is. A house is never finished. Luckily for us. I'm thinking about a small guest house in the back. And I want to move the barbecue there. What do you think? You shouldn't have a problem with the guest house, for the permit, I mean. As for the barbecue, you don't really need me. -A local builder will do. -Yes, but if you know... Can you pour me some wine? Sure. -More wine? -No, thanks, Aliki. Everything was excellent. We should get going. We have an early start tomorrow. Next time we'll bring the kids along. Any time you like. How are things in Athens? Is it hot? What? Is it hot in Athens, these days? Yes, very hot. Here it's paradise. Pity we missed Panayotis. He was running around all day. Fell asleep like a log. I'll go. I saw Vicky the other day, your ex-colleague. We spoke about you. Surgeries have become too serious since you left. Surgeries are a serious thing. That's not what I meant. They are missing your humor. Aliki, everyone knows it was not your fault. I am happy to see you got over it. -Your new job... -We're doing fine here. Don't worry about me. Petros is taking care of me. Either fix that or seal it. Somebody might fall in. What was it? The metal cover on the well collapsed. I thought that the barbecue began re-building itself. Anyway, your house is amazing. It reminds me of your Athens house, in a way. By the way, did you sell it? Yes. Took us a long time to find this one. And it needs a lot of work. Next time you come down here, stay a while, we'll take care of you. Sure. We'll be back at the end of the month. We'll see. It depends on the local workers. Leave that. Come on. Stop. Come on. Stop it. What is this, Panayotis? Did you wet yourself? Hello there. What brings you here? Hello. I'm visiting someone who lives here. And you? I was showing a house nearby. What a happy coincidence, I was going to call you. I have something unique I wanted to show you. Thanks, but this is not a good time. It has a beautiful garden. You'll love it. The house was designed by German architects. They are not like us. They have taste. Like you. Another time. Thank you. What are you doing? I've figured you out. You're not buying anything. How about we fuck, then have some dinner? Fuck off, you prick! Ms. Anna knows that you're living at her house? I should go to the cops. But it's not my style. I suggest we start over, you and me. Your kind likes it rough, huh? Aliki? Sorry. Yes, I am. Hello. Yes. He's a good friend. Of course. With pleasure. No, that's not so far. OK. Great. Thank you very much. Pleasure. Bye. Aliki? Where were you? What happened? Nothing. I'm sorry about yesterday. I need the car. Sorry to keep you waiting, I was on the phone. No problem. You're leaving today? Yes. I came with Kostas for a couple of days. -You know him well? -We go back a long time. -Have a seat. -Thanks. The local workers are a serious headache for him. I'm sure you've had the experience. -Have a seat. -Thanks. I appreciate Kostas a lot. Smart, and fundamentally honest. -He told me you were with Eurocash? -Yes. Financial analysis, investments and portfolio management. Small, but dynamic. Small, big... When the bubble bursts, that's that. The idea is to keep away when it happens. Right after the hilltop. Yes. Thank you. Me, in 2001, I didn't leave my house for a month. Refused to see anyone. I lost 6 kilos. I wasn't eating anything. Only whiskey. My wife was terrified. The clients were pushing for more profit and I couldn't resist. I had clients with short positions for millions of dollars, totally uncovered. Then started the bankruptcies. -You've bounced back since. -Of course. The thing is not how low you fall, or how much you lose, but to understand what happened. Perfect. Thank you, Gloria. Put it there. Great. Plums with chocolate. You've never had something like it, try them. Very good. Are you currently looking for someone? You were saying? I was asking whether you're looking for an associate for fund management. Not right now. But meeting is a good start, no? Yes. Of course. These workers again! Do you like the sea? A lot. Do you go fishing? No. I know nothing about fish. Pity, you don't know what you're missing. We will find the opportunity to do things together. We're neighbors after all. Do you need help? The gate is jammed. Isn't Ms. Anna around? No. My husband works at the house. Can I help with the bag? No. Thanks. For your trouble. I'll wait for my husband. No need for that. Have a nice afternoon. You too. Superman would have broken the gate. Also Batman. Dad would have broken it too. When is Daddy coming? He's coming. Are we going to Athens? Yes. I'm hungry. There's a sandwich on the table. Good afternoon. Would you like another? No thanks. May I? You have a kid too, don't you? Yes. I've seen him. Is he here? At home. Where do you live? You work next door, don't you? I see. I have this well that needs fixing. Need extra work? Sure. Whenever you want. -Open the trunk please. -It's full, put it in the back. It will mess up the car. I can bring it. No. Put it in. We'll do it another time. As you wish. Shouldn't you do this in winter? What is it to you? I have a house here. The big one up there. Leave it. -Where are your parents? -I don't know. -You live here? -Yes, in the other house too. Panayotis, come. Let's go get you dressed and grab your toys. Here... Oliver! Petros! Petros? Petros? Panayotis, you stay here while I go look for Daddy. OK. Where is your mom? She went looking for Daddy. -Since when are you staying here? -I don't know. -Where do you sleep? -Me downstairs, mom and dad here. And what do you like doing here? Play ball and dive into the swimming pool. Ah, you swim in the pool... How nice. Yes. Put that down, it will calm the dog. Take Panayotis and leave. We're leaving together. You turn this and it plays music. I see. You can have it.
