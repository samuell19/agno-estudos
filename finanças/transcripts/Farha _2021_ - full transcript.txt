The Sheikh will be upset! Help me up. Farha! - Come on! - Hurry. Farha, come on FARHA IN PALESTINE, 1948 ''If you do not aid him, Allah has already aided him when the unbelievers had driven him out as one of two when they were in the cave.'' ''And he said to his companion: 'Do not grieve...''' ''And he said to his companion: 'Do not grieve. Indeed, Allah is with us.''' ''And Allah sent down his tranquility upon him... and supported him with angels you did not see and made the unbelievers...'' ''And made the word...'' ''And made the word of the unbelievers...'' ''The lowest.'' ''the lowest, while the word of Allah is the highest.'' ''And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.'' To God Almighty has spoken the truth. Today, I will dismiss you earlier, girls. As you know, tomorrow is Suad's Henna Night. I hope to officiate all your weddings soon. Or better to hope that we have a school in the village, just like the boys. You may all go now. - How are you, dear? - Good. Pass my greetings to the mayor. I will see him later. Go, my daughter. - Don't go too far from the house. - Yes, Mother. I can't believe you're finally here. Me neither. If only I could live here. Why would someone from the city want to live here? What's here in the village? A few sheep? There are trees, birds... And you. Listen... Don't you dare come live here. What if it works out and I go live in the city? I'd kill you. Really, I would! Imagine if I were to go to school in the city? I would have a school bag and notebooks and pencils. We would go to school together in the car. Speaking of school. Any updates from your father? I still don't know... I'm hoping to find out today. - Aren't those the English? - Looks like it. Go! Good riddance! - How do you say that in English? - I don't know... Maybe ''goodbye''? Goodbye. Goodbye! Look at the mess you’ve made! Even while leaving! - Get out of here! Go away! - Out! Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! I shot an Englishman! What weapons? And what armed men? You speak as if we have a real army. Fully equipped with machines guns, tanks, planes. All we have are a few rusted weapons and dud bullets. Some bullets are even filled with wax. Welcome Farha. My God, my God! - I wouldn't recognize you in the street. - How are you, uncle? Great, now that I see you! Yes, Farha is all grown up. Now, it's time to see her as a bride. Come on... She is still young. Father, school registration will close by the end of next week. My dear, we already discussed this. Now is not the time. Serve your uncle tea. Thank you very much. Thanks. Set it down on the table. I'll drink soon. Thank you for your hospitality, Abu Farha. - Sameeha! Where are you? - I'm coming. Hurry, so you can leave before it gets dark. Come on sister, faster. You're leaving before receiving proper hospitality. Certainly not. You've been more than generous. You know how much I like talking with you. But you know the situation. Our mother is sick and the roads are not safe nowadays. It's better to get there before sunset. I hope your mother feels better soon. And try to visit us more often, not once every two months! God willing. Listen. Take it easy on the girl. So what if she wants to get an education? What could happen? Educating the young is like engraving in stone. Well... We do not want to go against the flow. Let me find her a husband who can take care of her in these circumstances. Besides, you are the only one encouraging her. She is already very stubborn. Listen, the newspaper I got you has the registration paper for the city's school. - No... - Listen! Think about it, but don't take too long. There's not much time left. I will take care of her when she comes to the city. Farha can take care of herself. Wait no longer, say yes - Hello, sister. - I am ready to go. You are family and your word is of great value. You know how dear you are to us. - I will think about it. - Good. Where is Farha? We want to say goodbye! Where are you, Farha? Come over here, precious one. I won't be away long. Take care of your father. Hopefully, everything will turn out fine. Right... We must leave now. Remember what we discussed. Goodbye. Goodbye. I won't be long. - Next time we should play backgammon. - So you want to lose? - Take care. See you soon. - God be with you! - Thank you. - Take care on the road. - You're always welcome here. - Having you with us reassures us. Thank you. I need your advice on a matter. Farha is smart and she's into education. I'm thinking of sending her to the city. So she can study. I don't want to disappoint her. You've educated her. You know her as well as me. We discussed this, Mayor. She should remain by your side under these unsettling circumstance. - The situation is not safe. - I understand. And what education are you talking about? She already learned the Quran. What else is there to learn? Geography, history, math, English! Farha! Where did she get this stubbornness? - Who is it? - Open the door. It's me, Naser. - Yes? - How are you, Farha? Good. Here. It's food prepared by my mother until your stepmother is back. - Thanks. - Wait, wait... - So you don't know how to cook at all? - No, I don't! I can't see! I can't see...! - Did you have fun? - Yes. - Isn't that Naser? - Yes... Let's go. What were you talking about with my uncle and his son? Father. Father! - Abu Fahed! - Hello, mayor. - How are you? - Fine, thanks. What were you talking about with my uncle and his son? You mean your future husband? Go ahead. What's wrong with your cousin Naser? And why not get married? All the village girls are getting married. I don't want to get married. What? What are you saying? Stop where you are right now! Shame on you. This is how she speaks to her father! Her father, who raised her and brought her the registration paper... so she can study in the city. Really, Father? Is this for real? Hey...? Ah wee ha - Farha is going to the city school! -Ah wee ha - Farida will be over the moon -Don't make a scene! Get down here! Ah wee ha, and the mayor is the best father in the whole village This girl will be the end of me! - Here you go. - Thanks. Almost all Palestinians in the center and to the south are now displaced. And they are seeking refuge elsewhere. And ever since my family was entrusted with this village, all we care about is to keep the land safe as well as people's lives. - So this is your final decision, mayor? - I've said everything I have to say. We welcomed you in our home and we respect you as our esteemed guests. Come on, men. We have no more time to waste! Abu Nimer! Listen to me. I was promised that the Arab countries will send both troops and ammunition. It's better that we wait. When they arrive, I will head this army myself. - And I will be the first one to fight. - This isn’t a truce. They are buying time. Eventually, your land will turn into ashes. I never expected that you would let us down. Goodbye! I hope your troops don't take too long, Abu Farha! REGISTRATION PAPER: FARHA, SCHOOL YEAR 1948/1949 Father? Father? Farha, why are you up so early? What are you doing, Father? I'm filling the gaps between the stones. And mud holds the stones together. Don't you want to go back to sleep? I forgot to tell you, my father said yes. - Really? For sure? - Yes. I can't believe it! - Is something wrong? - No, it's nothing. You don't seem happy. Of course I'm happy. But I'm worried about my father. It will be difficult to leave him. That's all. But he won’t be alone. - I know why you're upset. - Why? - You lost the groom! - Hey! Enough! No, no. Stop! I'll be quiet. - Don't worry. He'll wait for you. - Farida! Fine, fine. Enough, I'll stop! You know what I have decided? When I finish studying in the city, I want to become a teacher. Then I open a school here in the village, and only for girls. When I grow up, I want to become... Have mercy on your women and children and save them from this bloodbath. Get out of this village while you still can. Oh God! Oh God! Go away! Get out of here! Run! Run! Get out by using the north road while it's still open. Are you hurt? Where have you been? Let's go! Farida! Farida, are you OK? We must hurry! Go! - Get in the car! - Where's my father? - Did you see my father? - We will look for him. Get in, Farha! Get in! Where are you going? Hey! What are you doing? Masoud! Masoud! Please take care of her. -Get in the car -You heard your father. No, Father. My daughter, get inside now! Are you OK, Farha? From where are they coming in? They surrounded the village from all sides. Only the north exit is still open. Go north, to Khallet Al Taweel. I'll be behind you. I'm not leaving you. I'll secure the family, go to the other village heads and come back for you. Kamel! - Look out. Look out! - Calm down. - Stop the car, uncle. - There is no time! - Let me out! - Stay here! - Farha, stop it! - I have to stay with my father! - Oh God! - Take the women! Farha! - Farha! Farha! - What are you doing? Get in! Farha! Why did you come back... - Father? - Farha! - What's this, father? - The village has fallen. Where should we go? What shall we do? What are you doing? Are we going to Farida's? Farida... I told you to go with Masoud, but you did not listen! Are we going to the city? Where should we go...? Why didn't you listen to me? - Come with me. - Where are we going? There is no time for food. We have to go! - We should follow them. - Go in and wait for me. - No. - I will come back to get you. - Do you understand? - I will stay with you. - I will be back. - I want to stay with you, father. It's not possible. I will not repeat myself. Do as I tell you. Come on. Get in! No, I won't! Don't be afraid. I'll come back for you. There's no time for this! - Listen... - Father...? - This is the safest place. - Then stay with me! I can't! I have to be with the people. The soldiers have invaded our village. Please, understand. - No, Father! - Calm down. Wait here for me. I'll come back to get you. Don't be afraid. I won't be long. Keep this with you. Do you hear me? - Father! - I will not leave you. Stay with me! Farha... I will be back. Stay inside. Do not be afraid. Father...? Father? TO MY DEAREST FRIEND, FARHA FROM FARIDA Father...? Get out now! Take the boy and move fast!
