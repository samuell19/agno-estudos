Who asked you? Now was you a hearer the other day when I asked you to clean your room, hmm? Mmm hmm. Now how about you go be a doer of that? Liv, you better not be eating cookies with that dress on. Now did you get the greenery? Let's see, I think I did. I did. That's what I'm talkin' about. See this is what I was waitin' for when we got out of church. Oh, I already know. Look, I was thinking about this in church. You know what? Let's just go on back here 'cause my child already preachin' to me, talking about I need to be a doer of the Word. Let's just go on back here. All right, y'all, I'm about to go hang out with my friends but, Pop, can you move the car first? God. Dude, you're messing with the star rotation.

I got you. Ooh, that's fire enough. Where'd you get this from? I got it from Tim tonight. Some white boy. Hey, you got this from buddy? He always got that fire on him. There is somethin' with the white boys. They always got that gas. Right? What was that? Oh, shoot, it's my mom. You gotta go. How am gonna do that when they're comin' in the door? Go out the window. God. Why y'all back so soon? What happened? Because Mom forgot her phone, again. Come on, Jacks. Girl, you and that dog. Girl, don't be hatin'. That's my baby. Well, you need to go put your baby up so we can hit the trail. All right. Come on, Jacks. Hey, girl, I thought you'd be busy right now. I was busy until my mom almost caught Jason in the house. Hold up, Jason? I thought you was supposed to be with Raymond. I am in a few minutes. Jason and I made plans too. So, you were gonna be with both guys? You know they got a name for that, right? How come they got a name for it when we do it, but when guys do it it's cool? Why would you even want to do that? Because it's fun, and I'm not tied down to anyone. Taneya, that's really not cool. You really gotta chill out. I will eventually. Look, I gotta go. I'm gonna call you later. Don't forget your essays are due next Friday. Jason? Can I see you for a second? What's up? Why are you not takin' this class seriously? What do you mean? I'm makin' a C in these class, enough to graduate. You're not making a C, which proves my point. If you were takin' this class seriously, then you would know you're grade. Not to mention you're always disrupting the class, disturbing the classmates who do take this class seriously. Look, my bad, all right, but what do I need to do to pass this class? First you need to make at least a B on your next essay and your next two tests. A B? I'm not really good with essays. You have the opportunity to be good if you would just take this class seriously. I don't even know to write about. Write about what's important to you. Write about your life, your plans, something.

What, I got that from Tracy. You know she loves to talk. I see she loves to lie too 'cause that ain't what happened. Then tell us what really happened. All right, we almost got caught. See her mom came home early, and then I had to sneak out the window. Ah, man, so nothin' happened? Nothin' happened. I mean maybe that's a good thing. From what I've heard, everybody can get it. Yeah, I heard that too. But, Tim, didn't you try and push up on her sophomore year? Yeah, so? Did you get it? Nah, nah. Then that must not be true. Boy, you crazy. Uh oh, check out Boy Genius. Man, can't believe that kid go to school with us. Tryin' to make us look bad. Watch this. You okay, man? Yeah, thanks. Can't stand them. I know, man. You just gotta learn to ignore 'em. No offense, Marcus, but it's kind of hard to know that making the ground. Did y'all see that? You're wild, bro. That was crazy. Man, there was books and glasses everywhere. I'm sorry man, but things will get better. Well, I hope so because the ground's not my ideal choice of a well-balanced meal. Man, that Marcus get on my nerves. He's always gotta be to the savior. He thinks he's better than everybody. He doesn't bother me though. All he does is read his Bible and pray. That's all. But what kid does that? I mean that's just too much. Like he probably doesn't even have a girl to be honest. I mean, yeah, he does. It's that Bible he is holding. But don't you go to church, Jason? Yeah, but you ain't gotta do all that. The Lord knows my heart. There goes Taneya. What's up? Hey, I'm sorry about yesterday. I don't know what happened. My mom is never home at that time. That's okay. We can hang out another time. What are your plans this afternoon? I have a doctor's appointment. Ah, okay, well, I'll text you tonight. Okay. Come on, y'all. Bye, big hair. She must like you. Man, shut up. Oh, there go Miss Hubbard and Miss Green. About to go take their afternoon smoke and drink break. I bet you they smoke weed. I don't know about smokin' weed, but I know Miss Hubbard be takin' them swigs. Wait, wait, wait, she be drinkin'? Dude, you don't be smellin' her breath in the classroom? No. Well, your nose must be on strike. She be makin' my eyes water. You feel me. Hey, Marcus. Man, that corny Marcus. He be gettin' on my nerves, man. Where is my lighter? You can never find that lighter. Must be a sign you need to quit. Please, I need to be smokin' two at the same time workin' here with these crazy kids. I feel you, girl, 'cause these kids can take you there. You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah, I see they're takin' you straight to la la land. It's like they have no kind of home training. Except for Marcus, he's such a good kid. Yes, he is. If we could just clone a whole school of him. Well, we'd better get back to prepare for our next class. Good, they're finally gone. Hey, y'all, look what I got. Ooh, where'd you get that from? Ah, man, my mom and dad keep a ton of these in the house. Don't you think they're gonna notice one missin'? Man, they smoke too much to even notice. Yeah, but anyone got a light? I got one. Well, since you got the lighter, you get to light it. Cool. Go ahead, man. I don't mess with that. All right. Man, that Caylin is fine. Too bad Taneya's got you on lock down. Who? Me and Taneya ain't a couple. Watch this. I'll be back. All right. Hey, what's up, Caylin? What's up, Caylin? Hey, Jason. Why you and I ain't a couple yet? Gee, I don't know. Maybe because you're a player. Who told you that? I ain't seein' anybody right now. I wasn't sayin' you were seeing anybody. I was thinking more like everybody. Oh, so you got jokes, huh? Nah, for real though, I ain't seein' nobody. Look, you probably got a man anyway, don't you? Actually, I don't. Good, that way I won't have to take you from him. You're a little confident, aren't you? Always. Jason. Yo, which one of y'all called me? Yo, no one called you. I could've sworn I heard someone call me. Anyway, so, you gonna give me your number or what? I don't know, should I? I think you should. Jason. Yo, man, y'all stop callin' me for nothin', bro. Dude, there's nobody callin' you. You need to stop smokin'. Forget y'all, man. I know I heard somebody call my name. Didn't you hear somebody call me? Nope. I heard it clear as day. I didn't hear anything. Maybe you do just need to cut back on the weed. Look, I gotta go. I will catch you at fifth period. All right, man, which one of y'all called me, for real? Ain't nobody call you, Jason. You're messin' with my high. I'm out. For real, we'll catch you later, bro. You're trippin'. Yeah, bro, deuces. Man, ain't nobody trippin'. What, man? Man, you're not trippin', man. Oh, so you heard it too? Nah, but I know whose voice you're hearin'. Whose? It was God. What? God ain't callin' me. Now you trippin'. Man, all right, man, I guess it's the weed. I'll see you, bro. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold up, hold up. So, you really think it was God, huh? What does God got to do with me? Why's He callin' me? Good question. I would love to know the answer to that myself. So, what if He calls me again? What do I do? Bro, just try listenin'. Mom? Dad? Nobody's home. Jason. Yes, God? Why do you insist on hurting me? Hurting, hurting you? Hurting you how? By choosing not to follow me. But I do follow you. I go to church every Sunday and go to Bible study every week. You think that's all it takes to follow me? You are doing so many things that are not pleasing to me. You are mean to me. You lie. You steal from your parents. You smoke. You fornicate. Should I keep goin'? No, God, I get it. Do you wanna go to hell, Jason? No, no, God, I don't. Well, that's where you're headed. Please, just tell me what I need to do. I would appreciate it if you will not put yourself in situations that will make you sin against me. It was I that send Taneya's mother home that day. Really? I needed to protect you. I have work for you to do, and I can't have you distracted. You'll thank me later, but for now I need you to do the opposite of what you are doing. I need you to get a Bible and read it daily so you can get to know me. And I need you to pray to me every day. You have a high level respect with your friends. Use it to your advantage so that I may get the glory. But how did you know I? Nevermind. If you follow me, anything that you ask of me shall be given. Are you cookin' tonight? - Taneya Phillips? - I don't think so. We should get those cauliflower wings. Oh, that sounds delicious. Then you won't have to cook. No dishes for me. - Hi. - How are you? How are you? Fine. Have a seat. The doctor will be with you in a few minutes. - Okay. - Thank you. Hello, ladies. - Hi, Dr. Ragland. - Hi. I'm glad you were able to come in today. We did receive Taneya's test results, and I am sorry to inform you, but she has tested positive for HIV. What? Yes, I'm so sorry. Now, HIV is not like it used to be. Today with proper medication, you can live. Now, I would like to go ahead and start treatment. Taneya, baby. It's gonna be okay. Come on, let's go home. If you guys would like to get a little counseling, here's the number to a great one. Thank you. You're welcome. You're mad at me, aren't you? No, I'm not mad, but hurt, very much so. Your life is about to take a turn that I never wanted you to take. Just go ahead and say it. I should have listened to you. I'm surprised you don't hate me. Taneya, I could never hate you. No matter how many mistakes you make, I'll always love you, and I will always be there for you. And that will never change. I'm sorry, Mom. Come here. You ruined my life. You're the one that was fine with me not usin' protection. So, don't just blame me. So, it's like that? You give me HIV, and you have absolutely no remorse? I am sorry. I didn't even know I had it, but it's done now, and we both have to deal with it. I'm sorry. Yeah, me too. Hey, you okay? It's gonna be okay. We'll get through this. It's not a death sentence. Hey, girl. Hey. Why you look like you lost your mate? I wish that was the case. What that supposed to mean? Not what you think. What's wrong, girl? I tested positive for HIV. You're not gonna say anything? What can I say? I told you on many occasions to stop messin' around with all those guys, and you wouldn't listen. Tracy, you know, I really don't need an I told you so right now from my best friend. Well, that's all I have. You ruined your life because you wanted to be a female player. I'm sorry, but not sorry. - You know what? - You put yourself in this predicament. If it's gonna be like that, you can leave. Gladly. Get off my porch.

Who you tellin'? Me too. Have you talked to Taneya? More like argued with her. Why was y'all arguin'? Because I told her the truth. If she wasn't sleepin' around, she would not have gotten HIV. She has HIV? Mmm hmm. Way to go, Tracy. Like that's the last thing she wants to hear from a friend when she receives the worst news of her life. Look, I was just keepin' it real. I was not tryin' to hurt her, but I wasn't gonna sugarcoat it either. I mean, she almost put Jason at risk. That's true. Man, I ain't gonna lie. It was funny when Jason thought somebody was callin' his name. His mom and dad be havin' that gas for real. You need to stop smokin' that mess, for real, actin' like y'all drunk. Oh, so, what, you're our debtor now? Don't knock it until you try it, bro. Nah, I value my brain. I wanna keep it all there. Whatever, man. What are they doin' here? I don't know. You know they're not here to play no basketball game. Right? Let's go talk to 'em. Yeah. Oh, there goes Steve. He is so cute. Girl, you have been crushin' on him all year. Why don't you just tell him? I mean, you have no problem tellin' everything else. Heh, heh, heh, very funny. Here they come. What's up, y'all? What's up? What's up? Hey, Steve. What's up, Tracy? Where's your other two partners? Ah, Tim's at soccer practice And Jason's probably at home thinkin' he's hearin' Tupac's voice. Oh, yeah, I heard about that. That's what y'all get for smokin'. Who? Me and Tim was good. Jason was the only one who was losin' his mind. What about you, Steve? Ah, no, I don't mess with that. Good, you're too fine to be messin' with that stuff. Thank you. So, where's y'all ringleader? Probably at home depressed. Depressed? Depressed for what? You know she went to the doctor, and she found out she has HIV. What? Are you serious? Yep. That's unfortunate. Yeah, that's messed up. Jason dodged a bullet on that one. You ain't never lie, bro. Why y'all ain't with her? Ask Tracy. I tried to tell her stop messin' with all those dudes, thinkin' it's cute. Now, she's payin' for it. And honestly, I don't want people to think I'm like her because we hung together. Hoo, that's cold, Tracy. Well, that's how I feel. What's up, y'all? WHat's up? Still hearin' voices? Whatever. Hey, did you hear about Taneya? What about her? She found out yesterday at the doctor that she has HIV. Are you serious? Wait, wait, wait, how do y'all know for sure? Man, you know Tracy stay gossipin', but you'd better thank God her mom came home that day, bro. Jason. It was I that sent Tanea's mom home that day. Jason? Yeah, what's up? You good? Yeah, yeah, I'm good, man. Hey, what's up with you, Jason? Thank you. You're not settin' me up, are you? No, man. Why don't you have a book bag anyway? You need money for that, something that my family lacks right now. You know what? Now you have one. Wait, there's not a trap in this bag that's gonna make all my books foul up, is it? No, here. What is he doin'? Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, Marcus. Hey, what's up, man? Hey, man, what's up? You heard from Him, huh? Yeah, how'd you know? Because you're over here talkin' to me. Look, He told me to do the opposite of everything that I've been doin', but I still don't get it. Why, why would He pick me? I mean, why wouldn't he pick you, Jason? Look around. You're the most popular guy at school, and everybody looks up to you. Now, imagine what it would be like if the most popular guy in school followed God. Hey, can you look up a scripture for me real quick? I don't have a Bible yet. Hey, no problem, man. I have an extra one for you right here. You just walk around with an extra Bible in your book bag? No, but I hear from God too. Oh, oh, thanks, man. No problem, man. What's this? You're hangin' out with this lame now? Hey, he's not a lame. What's up with you? Why are you trippin'? Look, I'm just goin' through a lot right now, all right? That's why. Is readin' one of these Bibles one of the things you got goin' on? Yeah, man, I think it's time I changed. You know, spend a little time with God. What? Are you kiddin' me? This is a joke, right? So, was that the voice you heard yesterday? Yeah. Cool. Let's get out of here. This fool's trippin', talkin' about some debt with God. All the sudden he's baby Jesus. Come on, Steve. You know, I think I'm gonna stay. What you lookin' for? It's this scripture God gave me. I need to know what it says. There go Taneya. Girl, I heard she got HIV. I heard that too. Hey, I called you last night. Why didn't you answer? I'm sure you heard about me, and I didn't wanna waste any more of your time. I'm sorry. Are you okay? I will be. Where are all your friends at? What friends? I don't have those anymore. You still have me. Here, you wanna come sit with us? Sure. Was there a bomb threat we didn't know about? I know, where'd all the kids go? What's goin' on over there? Is that Jason readin' a book durin' lunch? And sittin' with Marcus? Did hell freeze over or somethin'? You know you are wrong for that, but did it? Whatcha doin'? Reading. The Bible? Yeah. Wow, Jason, that's so cool. Do you pray too? I sure do. Would you pray with me? Yeah, what do you wanna pray about? I want to pray about Mom and Dad start doin' what you're doin'. Yeah, okay, let's pray. Father God, we thank you for another day, and we ask that you forgive us for our sins. Lord, I know you told me that if I change my ways and whatever I ask will be given to me. Well, Lord, we ask that you take away our parents' desire to smoke and open their hearts so that they can follow you. And, Lord, I pray the same for my friends too. And, Lord, can you take away Miss Hubbard and Miss Green's desire to smoke and drink too? In Jesus' name, amen. Amen. Hey, baby. Hey, Mom. Hey. How long did they sleep? Like 30 minutes. And I'm gonna be doin' the same thing 'cause I am tired. - Hey, Ma? - Hmm? Me and some of my friends, we have a Bible study at school during lunch, and why don't you come and have lunch with me one day? What'd I look like at a school havin' lunch let alone Bible study lunch? What's wrong with that? Parents come have lunch with their kids all the time. Yes, lunch. Now, I don't have a problem with lunch 'cause I probably them lunches anyway, but the Bible study? Oh, no. I gets my Bible study once a week at the church. Just, just think about it, okay? Yeah, okay. I'm gonna take my nap.

How long do think it's gonna take for you to finish my hair? Um, about 15 minutes. Yeah, it's gonna be about 30 minutes 'til I can get you. Can you wait? Yeah, yeah, I could do that. They ain't even put my car inside. All right. I'll see you in a few. All right, bye, Hey, babes. Hey, Ma. Oh, your hair look nice. Ah, thank you. Unfortunately, it had to rain on it. Yeah, it is nasty today. Mmm hmm. So, how long's it gonna be for your car be ready? About two hours. So we gotta pick up Liv and Ty from Aunt Tandy's house. Oh, okay. Well, oh, Ma, how long is Dad gonna be gone this time? Ah, four days. He said they gotta do a drop off in Pennsylvania and a pick up in New York. - New York? - Mmm hmm. Oh, I gotta call him, see if he can get me them new Jordans I want. Boy, ain't nobody thinkin' about no shoes. Don't be callin' him askin' about no shoes. Ma, you always fussin'. 'Cause you always givin' me a reason to. I guess. Ma, can I ask you somethin'? Yeah. Do you believe God speaks to us? Yes, I do. Now, unfortunately I don't stick around long enough to listen. Why you askin' me this? 'Cause He spoke to me. What, really? So is that why you've been readin' the Bible in that room and then tryin' to get me to come to your school? Yeah. What did He say? Well, He told me if I don't do the opposite of everything I've been doing, I face punishment. Jesus, Jason, what have you been doin'? Oh, no, don't act like you can't tell me. You're already in trouble with God, and I can't top that. Well, before I do, just can you promise me you won't get mad? I won't get mad, Jason. Ma can you, can you please 'cause you already look mad. Boy, I won't get mad. - See. - Now what did He say? This is what I was talking about. Okay, okay, okay. First, I, I stole a joint out of your drawer, and me and my friends smoked it at school. Mmm mmm, mmm mmm, mmm mmm mmm. Go ahead. And I've been bullyin' a couple kids at school. Jason, now you know I didn't raise you like that. I know, Ma, I know. I'm, I'm sorry. Anything else? I've been having sex. Great, now he gonna make me a 30-year-old grandma. Ma, I'm not gonna make you a 30. Wait, wait, wait, 30? Boy, let me have my moment. Now you done gave me all this news. I can be 30 if I wanna be. Okay, okay, okay, you 30. You can be 30. But, Ma, I gotta tell you something else. God saved me from contracting HIV. Oh, my God, Jason, how? So, you remember that Sunday after church I said I was gonna go hang out with my friends? Yeah. Well, I went over this girl Taneya's house, and we were about to, you know, but her mom came home. Oh, thank God for that mother. Yeah, that's what I said. But I mean I'm grateful that God saved me, but I just can't help feelin' bad for Taneya. I mean, I feel so helpless. I keep, there's nothing I can do for her. Imagine how she feels. Look, all you can do, Jason, is be a friend to her and be a great friend, okay? Okay. Now, come here. Now, thank you for not killing me, Ma. Oh, you ain't off the hook yet. Yeah, me and God are about to do a tag team on that tail. And let's go pick up the girls. Put your seatbelt on. What's up, Chris? What's up? I didn't think you were gonna show. I've been here. Really? I just, you know, needed to clear my head. Thinkin' about Jason? I don't get it, Steve. Why this fool trippin'? All right, bro. The only reason you think he's trippin' is 'cause you don't understand where he's coming from. People hear from God, Chris. And when God calls you out like that, you'd be a fool to resist. You and Jason been friends for years now and ever since you've been kids whenever you get into an argument, Jason always call you up later, and y'all squash it like that. But not this time. This time Jason didn't call you, and what does that tell you? It tells you Jason's serious about his journey this time, and all you can do really is let him find his own way. If you're a real friend, really, you'd accept him and support him through this journey instead of being selfish and tryin' to end the friendship because he's tryin' to better himself. In fact, you let his light shine on you. So while you're out here clearing your thoughts, think about this. Does Jason really need a friend like you? Later, bro. Who are you? I'm Jason, ma'am. What do you want? Mom, it's okay He's a great friend of mine. Oh, sorry, come on in. It's okay, ma'am. I'm gonna go pick up your meds. I'll be back in a little bit. Okay. Nice to meet you, Jason. Same here. - Hey. - Hey. Have a seat. Would you like somethin' to drink? Yeah, always so hospitable, huh? That's how I was taught. I'll take a water. Okay. Here you go. Hey, you're not drinkin' with me? No, I'm good. So, how've you been? Sittin' in my room, wishin' I could turn back the hands of time. It's my fault though. Playin' around with these guys, and now I'm payin' for it. You gotta stop beating yourself up about this. Just start tryin' to get through it. How can you be so nice about it all? I mean, if my mom hadn't forgotten her phone, we'd be in this together. We're still in this together. I'm not goin' anywhere. Look, Taneya, it's not the end of your world. I mean, if God can forgive you, and I can forgive you, why can't you forgive you? Because I can't take it all in. I mean, it's not just the HIV. It's you. I think it would be better for me if the Jason I've always known would show up. Heck, yell at me for almost puttin' his life at risk. I just can't take this new you. It's stressin' me. I made a promise with God to do the opposite of everything that I've been doing. To be honest, I love it. I love my relationship with God. I love giving to people. I love just giving in general. It makes me feel warm inside. So, you're stuck with me. You're just gonna have to deal with it. I'm your new BFF. Thank you. Yeah, that's that smile that I've been missing. Come here. I got you. All right, B.G. Later, man. Okay, the sum of all chemical processes that occur in an organism is called what? Hey, am I tutoring myself? Because the last time I checked I don't need it. I'm sorry. I'm a little distracted today. Why, is it Steve? What? No, why would you say that? Come on, Tracy. Everyone knows you have a crush on Steve, but me personally, feel you can do a lot better. What's wrong with Steve? Nothin', if you like tall skinny guys that resemble a mop, but I digress. If he's not the one distracting you then what is? What do you know about the medical field? Well, I was accepted into Duke University MD program, but I didn't go 'cause it was too much stress goin' to school with you guys. Is it true that HIV is no longer a death sentence? Yes, it is. With the medication they have out now, people can live with HIV and not even give it to anyone. - Really? - Yep. Do you? No. Not me. My friend. Ah, sorry to hear that. Thank you for the information. Yep, are you ready to get back to work? Yes. Okay, the sum of all chemical processes that occur in the organism is called what? Um, metabolism? Correct. That's a nice little, a nice little add-on. Yeah. You know, we ain't sat down and done this in a while. I know. You think I've grown all old so you think you're too good to hang out with your Mama. Ma, that's not true. Yes, it is. But I ain't mad at you. I was a teenager once. Yeah, but you only get one mom. I don't wanna miss spendin' time like this with you. Me neither. So, now that I'm getting my time, what are your plans for the rest of the weekend? Ah, probably hang out with Taneya, get her out of the house for a little bit. You know, you spend a lot of time with that girl, and I have yet to meet her or her mother. You know what, you're right. Come on, let's go. Where we goin'? To meet Taneya and her mom. What, okay. Here we go. Hey, Jason. Hey, Miss Paula. This is my mom, Jan. - Hi. - Hi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Please come in. And Ma, this is Taneya. Oh, she's a cute little old thing. Thank you. So, you're the one that's been stealin' my son from me, huh? Well, we definitely have that in common 'cause Jason's been stealin' her from me. Can I get you anything? I was just about to make myself some coffee. Oh, that'd be great. I don't know why she drinks coffee this time of the day. Hey, mind your business 'cause I do the same things. Yeah, she really does. So, come on let me make you a cup. Awesome. Have a seat. So, how you take your coffee? Ah, one cream, three sugars. They've hit it off well. Yeah, they did. You wanna go on the porch? Yeah, sure. Mom, we'll be on the porch. Okay. Here you are. Thank you. You're welcome. That's good. So, how you been holdin' up? Not well. I show my strong face for Taneya, but I can't act like it's not tearing me up inside. And then I don't even know what's goin' on in her head. She seems to be maintaining, thanks to Jason. I can't help but feel like I failed her, you know? Yeah, I know that feelin'. I did fail Jason in a lot of ways, and one of those ways was smokin' that marijuana. And then he started sneakin' off doin' the same thing and stealin' my marijuana when he did it. Taneya was gettin' her hands on it too. You know, his dad and I told him to his face that as soon as he was old enough to know not to be tryin' it because he knows he's not grown, but that's what I get. Instead of assumin', I should've been teachin' and leadin' by example. Well, I gave Taneya too much freedom. I was too trusting, like I was never a teenager. I didn't even know she was having sex, let alone with more than one guy. So, I guess I failed her too. And that hurt. At least now we can get it right. I mean, look at them now. I mean, they both have found God, and that's a good thing. They could be rebelling. That's true. Jason's been a great friend to her. Well, their friendship is not one-sided because Taneya's been a great friend to him too. Well, I guess we did somethin' right, huh? Hey, there's that light at the end of the tunnel. I'll sip to that. There you have. So, have you talked to Tracy? No, I don't need a friend like that. A friend like what? Someone who kicks you when you're down and then tells all your business. Yeah, she does talk a lot. That's a flaw that can be prayed away. Yeah, maybe. It's just, I can't believe she did that to me. That was the worst news of my life, and all she could say was I told you so. What kind of friend does that? A friend that's hurting. She's always been there for you. There isn't anything that she wouldn't do for you. See, when people hear HIV, they automatically think death when that's no longer the case. So, maybe Tracy's just scared that she's gonna lose a friend. She blames you for it. Some people can't take that kind of hurt so they lash out. You just need to show her that she's not gonna lose you. Jason, I'm sorry. I have way too much to worry about right now then to worry about her and her temper tantrum. I mean, for someone that's always been there for me, just to bail out during a time when I need you the most, nah. I get it, but you're gonna have to forgive her eventually. I know. Hey, y'all. Hey, what's up, Boy Genius. You know somethin'. We always called you Boy Genius 'cause, I mean, that's basically what you are. You're a little kid that goes to school with us older kids, but I don't know your name. Probably because you never asked. You're right. So, what is your name? Greg. It's nice to officially meet you, Greg. Care to join us? Sure. And you know what, Marcus? I never got a chance to apologize to you either. That's okay, man. Nah, it's not, it's not okay. Look, I gave you a hard time every day, and not once did you retaliate. Now, I understand why God tells us to love our enemies. If you would've never stepped to me that day I heard God's voice, I'd probably still be goin' down the wrong path 'cause I didn't even know it was possible to hear from God. Yeah, I mean, you probably would've eventually agreed it was the marijuana. Yeah. Everybody thought I was crazy, except you. Everybody else left, but you stayed, and you helped me. Because of that, God saved me. Man, thank you, bro. You're the dopest friend I ever had, man. I love you for that, bro. Love you too, man. Look at Jesus and the disciples. I can't believe Jason and Taneya are still friends after what she almost did to him. And I can't believe we're still not friends with her. You're the one that told her business and are supposed to be her BFF. You should feel worse than anybody. I do. I'm gonna apologize to her. Yeah, me too. If y'all go over there, then y'all are gonna get punched in the nose by the Holy Spirit. You see what happened to Jason. Why do y'all have a problem with Jason? What's wrong with finding God? Jason is very humble now. It's sweet. He's very respectful and generous, something he has never been before. So, instead of judgin' him because he became a better person, you should consider takin' a page from his book and bein' more like him. Hey, yo. What's up, y'all? What's up? Yeah, what's up? How y'all been? I ain't seen y'all in a minute. Good. Been all right. So, what you got goin' on over there, a little Bible study or somethin'? Yeah, yeah, and I would really like it if you two would join us. Whatcha wanna do, man? I'm cool with it. Come on. I guess we can sit here since no one else is sitting over here anymore. Yeah. No cigarette today? No, I've been losin' the urge to smoke. I didn't smoke at home yesterday or at all today. Wow, that's good. And weird. I tried to stop cold turkey before, and it didn't work. Why now, when I'm not even tryin'? Maybe a little angel somewhere is helping you. Maybe. You're not into your coffee today? Nah, it started to make me too sluggish. Figured I'd chill on the drinking for a while. Are those bibles that they're reading? It looks like it. Jason and a Bible? Is it a satanic bible? Girl, stop. You know Marcus isn't satanic. Maybe Jason just changed. You know y'all are more than welcome to come join us, right? Y'all don't need us old folks over there crampin' your style. You're never too old for Jesus. Please. Mom, I'm so glad you made it. Yeah, I wanted to be here for you. How y'all doin'? Have a seat. Have a seat. And we fellowshipped, and some people even gave their lives to God. I never really realized how much influence I had on the people around me and because of that God used me to win their souls. Thank you. That was a great essay, Jason. Thank you. One question, what was of scripture you were looking for? Ah, it was 1 Timothy 4:12. "Let no man despise thy youth, "but be an example of the believers "in word and conversation, "in charity, in faith, in spirit, and purity." Thank you. Jason, that was a really great essay. Thank you. I'm lovin' the new Jason. Thank you. I am too. Have a good day. You too. We figured we'd join you this time. We all can use a little more Jesus in our lives. Yeah. Just go ahead and say it. Sorry, y'all. Yeah, there's that smile that I've been missin'. Cut, y'all got stuck. You're not drinkin' any. Um, get a better. I started to say one cream and three sugars. Thank you. You need money for that. Hey, baby. How was work today? I've had better days. God, why won't that door shut? I'm not about to stick around and watch you make a fool of yourself claimin' to be some Christian man. Why'd you look over here? I looked over there? Man, you're not trippin', man. So you heard it too? Yeah. My fault. You're supposed to BF be her BFF. The sum of all chemical processes that occur in an orzanive. Perfect. Cut.
