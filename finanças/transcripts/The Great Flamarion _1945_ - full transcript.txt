What's going on? That's what I want to know. Did you hear the scream? Anyone hurt? - I heard a shot from the stage. Yeah. That's what I heard. Tony the clown is trying to calm them. Folks, don't worry. The show is going right on. The music, boys. Yes, I'll take care of it. Boys, the music. Let me out of here. I'm going home. - You can't go home. Where was the shot? Where is Eddie? Where's Scottie? Where did they go? Eddie. Eddie. Eddie, where are you? Pretty good, huh? Ladies and gentlemen. Please. Quiet. Quiet. I regret to announce we are forced to terminate tonight's performance. There has been an accident here tonight. But there's no need for alarm. Just walk out quietly and your money will be refunded at the box office. Don't leave the theater. You will all be questioned later. Come now. Step lively please. If you will tell the truth it will save us a lot of trouble. You quarrelled with your wife tonight, didn't you? Didn't you? Yeah. We had an argument. It all adds up to murder. No. I tell you I didn't do it. I had nothing to do with it. You expect me to believe that? I tell you again. We just had an argument. Ordinary people argue once in a while. It doesn't mean anything. But this was more than an argument. Look. Haven't you got any feelings? My wife has just been killed. Well? I just found this under the sofa. Four shots fired. I found two of them in the wall. I guess the other two are in the body. Poor Eddie. It's a dirty shame. Yep. I've been working here for seventeen years. And never saw a prettier smile. She was nice to everybody. You should know. She was dynamite. If me and Sam played the same bill with her, I never let him out of my sight. Only last night her light was out and she wanted me to fix it. And now .. Her light is out for ever. You see. Them that least deserves it gets it. Better phone the headquarters again. Get everyone on state for questioning. - Yes, sir. Everybody on stage. I guess this simplifies the whole matter. What does? Look at this. I suppose you never saw it before, did you? You're right. I didn't. We just found it in your dressing room. This is the gun you killed her with, is it? She was my wife. I loved her. You don't kill the woman you love. Get the rest of the performers up here. But without Rosita. She has fainted. But I'll get them, sir. Right away. You. Monsieur. - Name? Fran?ois Gaston, Monsieur. Profession? - I'm an artist, Monsieur. You see. I am .. how you say it? Comment dites-vous que ..? I jump in and out of the barrel. You see? - Hiding in a barrel. Over here. Name. - Sally Hampton. Ten minutes of snappy songs and sassy sayings. That's us. Right? - Right. What do you know about this killing? - Not a thing, Your Honor. I mean, Mr Officer. We were in our dressing room. We didn't see nothing, we didn't hear nothing and we don't know nothing. Right? - Right. Did you know the deceased? - I'll say. And if you want my opinion, she didn't get no more than what was coming to her. Right? - Wrong. Well, right. - Next. She was strangled. So she wasn't shot. She was strangled. Now what? - Strangled? I don't believe it. I don't believe it. You're the only one who doesn't. Take this man to headquarters for further questioning. I wish I hadn't been here tonight. It was awful. Yeah. Just like I say. You can live a whole life backstage. In just one night. Last week, a stalker almost caught up with Joe's wife. And tonight. I don't even want to think about it. Those screams. Now that I think of it I should have investigated them sooner. Pop. You've seen a lot of things in your time, haven't you. Every day. It makes me feel that fellow was right. Life is nothing but a stage. And everybody plays on it. Yep. Only some of them get better billing. I guess you never know when your exit is coming. It's better that way. Well. I'd better go and finish my work. Oh .. don't forget to turn out the lights when you're through. Okay, Pop. Who is there? Who is up there? Who are you? Say, I've seen you before. Sure I have. You are Flamarion. The Great Flamarion. The Great Flamarion. I am Tony. The clown. I played on the same bill as you in Pittsburgh. Remember me? Water. You are hurt, Flamarion. I'll get a doctor. - No, no. Please don't. But you are liable to die. Yes. Oh, you don't know what you're saying. Nobody wants to die. I do. Why? Because I killed Connie. You? She shot me and .. I strangled her. But they are holding her husband. Tell them .. He is innocent. You had better tell them yourself. They may not believe me. I'll have them here in no time. It's no use. I'll be dead before they get here. But. Before I die. I want to tell you, Tony. Why I killed her. Let me. Let me. Go ahead. Talk then. The story starts in Pittsburgh. You remember my act. And my .. Two assistants. Connie and .. Al Wallace. [ Door knocks ] Mr Flamarion. How about giving one more bow before they tear up the seats? Let them. You were on beat off in front of the mirror. You came directly into my line of fire. - I'm sorry, boss. And I know why. Just one little one. Not enough to .. - Enough to cause an accident. I'll take my chances with you anytime. But it won't happen again. My act runs according to my rules. Those who break them .. are out. Mr Flamarion. Mr Flamarion. I'm sorry about Al's performance. - So am I. I promise you it won't happen again. It's not up to you to make that promise. Don't worry. Al will do as I say. There is no room for mistakes no matter what. I must be absolutely sure of my assistants. But Mr Flamarion. You can always be sure of me. I guess you don't realize how important all this is to me. The continued success of my act is my only concern. And mine. It is the only thing that makes my life bearable. If I couldn't look forward to the theater and the lights .. Just to seeing you. I wouldn't care if I never woke up again. Your personal feelings do not interest me in the least. I repeat once and for all: one more mistake .. And I am through with both of you. "I had picked up Connie and her husband Al six months before." "When they were a third-rate dancing act." "I had always thought of them as a happily-married couple." Okay, lush. That will be enough of that. You heard Flamarion. Maybe you like sleeping on a park bench but I don't. You scared it might cramp your style? One more crack like that and you are going to be down for the count. Don't try playing rough with me. Brother, you're asking for it. Can't you stay sober long enough to stooge for a couple of guns? It seems even a moron would have backbone enough to .. So now I'm a moron, huh? You've changed your tune since the day you bought our wedding ring. Are you scared I might slip off the hook? Look, Al. Let's not go into that routine again. There's an easy way out of all this .. - Another routine we won't go into. If you think I'll let you go so some other guy can have you, you're nuts. I'll get away from you sometime. You haven't got a prayer. Let's see. There was that business with the diamond ring in Memphis. The insurance company are still interested in that. And that little trick you pulled on the guy in Salt Lake City. He would love to know where to find you. And that quick shuffle you gave the bank president in Des Moines. Whatever did become of those bonds, Connie? I didn't find out until after I married you. What a busy life you had led. No. I don't think you'll get away from me. Not until I'm good and ready to let you go. Quit it, honey. You're just wasting a lot of valuable time on yesterday's bad news. Doesn't it interest you? - No. Only tonight interests me. Going someplace? Sure I am. I am going home with my husband. Connie. No matter what you do, you're the only dame for me. You're a bad habit I can't cure. Even if I wanted to. Any guy that wouldn't fall for you is either a sucker or he's dead. "I lived a lonely life." "I have no friends." "I didn't like people and people didn't like me." "I didn't drink. I didn't smoke." "I retired every night immediately after the performance." "For hours I practised to strengthen my eyes." "This afternoon my schedule was broken." "I had an unexpected visitor." [ Door knocks ] Who is it? It's me. Connie. Mrs Wallace, I am busy. I'll see you at the theater. I've got to talk to you. This sign means exactly what it says. You must listen. It's important. Well? I've found out why Al is drinking. The reason for his conduct does not interest me. Except as it affects my act. This affects you because it's personal. He is jealous of you. - Ridiculous. Jealous of me because I'm a star and he's a nobody? Am I responsible for his being a drunkard without ambition or talent? Has he any idea of how hard I had to work to get where I am? Al knows all that. There's more to life than what happens in a theater. What is it then? I think he knows how I feel about you. How you feel about me? Well, your work has always been satisfactory. You work for hours to strengthen you eyes but can't see. You are blind. Well, it had to happen. I'm only sorry that he found out before you did. I don't understand. Imagine what I go through every night. The music starts and the act begins. I move about the stage like a puppet. And then you enter and everything begins to live. Come to the point please. The excitement of being on stage facing the man who holds my life in his hands. You don't have to be afraid. - No. It's a strange sensation. You look at me. Your eyes are so steady, so piercing. You aim and fire and the bullet cuts through the air. I close my eyes. Then I feel the bullet hit the target, my shoulder strap. I tell myself that it was your hand. Every bullet is a caress. Do you see now? Mrs Wallace. Of course, you realize that now I have to look for two new assistants. No, Flamarion. No, please. - You have left me no choice. Okay, so we close tonight. And you go to Frisco alone. See how the act goes without us. Wait. Considering the fact it's impossible for me to replace you at such short notice. I'll have to overlook what happened. You can go with me to San Francisco. Thank you, Flamarion. Thank you. "That was the way Connie began." "It was her first approach." "I didn't know what was coming." I've been waiting for you for half an hour. I thought you would never get here. - How did you get in here? Wouldn't you rather know why than how? - I'm not interested .. In me or anything about me. I know the line. Mrs Wallace, please go. Close the door. I don't see any reason why I should. - Please, Flamarion. I know all about Alma. How do you know? You went through my suitcase? You are human. Darling, I wasn't really spying. Maybe a lady wouldn't have done it. But I'm just a woman in love. I had to see what made you afraid of me. - I'm not afraid of anybody. Oh yes you are. You're afraid of your heart. I'll never allow a woman to enter my life again. Isn't that silly? Just because you were burned once. I must ask you again to leave. I had to come. Al is at it again. He beat me. I'm not interested in your domestic problems. You don't seem to want to believe anything. Do I have to prove everything to you? I will show you. - Never mind. Get out. What are you? Haven't you any feelings? Isn't there any place in your life for anything but your work? Don't you care about what happens to me at all? I thought I had made that perfectly clear. We work together but that's all. Understand? Flamarion, you can't toss me out like this. I haven't any place to go. Al is crazy drunk. If I go back now .. I'll arrange for the porter to get you another room. The train has sold out. That is no concern of mine. - Isn't it? Does it mean anything to you that when I am in trouble my only thought is of you? I forbid you to speak this way. I cannot help it and it is your affair. Al is on a bender because .. Because he knows I love you. That settles it. You both leave the act in San Francisco. Simple, isn't it. I am honest, and what are my thanks? You fire us. - Exactly. So it's curtains for the Wallaces, huh? Now I guess it's up to me to go back and break the glad news to Al. He'll probably start in right where he left off. The funny part of it is I don't give a hoot. And you don't either, do you Flamarion? I do feel a certain responsibility. - Then let me stay here. No. - Please. Life is funny. I guess it happens to everyone sooner or later. It's not much fun to show your heart and see it get kicked about until it breaks. Well. Thanks for the lesson. Alright. You may stay. You know, Flamarion. I just found out what is the matter with you. You are asleep. Maybe this will wake you up. "It struck me like lightning." "Not for fifteen years." "Not since the tragedy of Alma and my dismissal from the army." "Had I been so close to a woman." "One look into a mirror would have shown me that I was not for her." "But there must have been something else behind it." "It was three days from Pittsburgh to San Francisco." "And in all that time she never went back to her husband." "I suppose he was too drunk to care." "It seemed that a new life had just begun." "In reality, it was the beginning of the end." Shall I serve now? - No. I'm waiting for a lady. This is a very special occasion. Thank you. Hello darling. You remember what you said that night on the train? I thought you would never get here. Orchids and champagne. You think of everything. I am trembling. You were as steady as a rock during the act tonight. Yes. But I wasn't waiting for you then. I love your hands. I stopped in at a little shop on Grand Avenue. Oh. A present. I hope you like it. The first gift I have made to a woman in fifteen years. Flamarion, it is beautiful. I bought it because I .. I seem to see you in it. And you will, darling. But you must keep it for me. All would know I could never afford something so expensive. His drinking is getting worse. It worries me. Yes. During the last show in Pittsburgh I had to watch his every move. Yes. I know. One mistake .. One serious mistake on his part may be fatal. It frightens me to even think of it. He should be the one to think about it. Does he realize that .. My only reason for keeping him is you? If you want me you've got to keep him. I've always been his meal ticket. Perhaps if I .. spoke to him and .. Told him how we feel about each other. No, darling. That would only make things worse. But, now we have each other. Today and tomorrow. And all the other tomorrows. Just leave it to me. I'll figure it out. She made it sound so wonderful. So convincing. I believed her because I wanted to believe her. But what I didn't know then was .. That on the same bill was a bicycle act. He was young, handsome. You know something, honey? - No. What? You look better to me now than you ever did. Why didn't you write me? I'm the kind of guy that likes to deliver things in person. How long are you going to be in town? - Two weeks. Me too. Then separated for months afterwards. Eddie, our next job is in Los Angeles. Can't you get .. Look. If I don't make it, it won't be because I didn't try. Sixteen bars and I'm on. Meet me after the show. - I wish I could. Al is on the warpath. Let's make it tomorrow. That little bar around the corner. Hiya, babe. Hello Cleo. What's new? - Not a thing with me. Is collecting me still your hobby? Can you think of a better one? Yeah. I'll take my dogs every time. You don't sit up nights waiting for them. Good evening, boss. - Evening. Got a lot of class, ain't they? - Plenty. Don't you think so, Connie? Yeah. They are swell performers. - He certainly is. Hiya, Maestro. What gives? That guy's family must have been awfully fond of children. Flamarion is alright. - He's just a little strange. Keep right on calling it 'strange'. But in my book he's strictly a heel. Well, I guess it's time to get down to the office. I'll see you around, Cleo. Don't go leaning into no bullets. - Don't worry. Flamarion knows what he is doing. - Meaning that I don't? See? That's what I meant when I said I would take my dogs. Do you like it, darling? - Very much. And do you like me a little too? Connie. We've got to do something about Al. I thought if I were to make it worth his while. I mean financially. - He'd only spend what you gave him. And then no dough, no wife and no meal ticket. Oh no. He'd never stand for a deal like that. I want to make a new life for us. That would be wonderful. Even if there isn't any chance of making it come true. It must come true. You are proud of these, aren't you? They were my only friends until I found you. I hope you take as good care of me. Put that down. That is dangerous. Now you know how I feel. What if I had as little faith in you? I entrust my life to you every night. That is another reason why we belong together and always will. I won't even think about tomorrow without you. I know. I can't sleep at night. I just like away and dream about tomorrow. Our tomorrow. The other night I dreamed about the three of us. It was on stage. You and Al and I. As Al stood before the mirror you .. Fired and missed. I never miss. Of course not. Al was drunk. It was an accident. Well. I said it was just a dream, didn't I? I have asked you to come here because I want to talk to you. Okay. Start talking. Sit down. None of my warnings have meant anything to you. You still continue to drink. I know how to take care of myself. Don't you realize, Al .. That every time we step onto that stage that you are nothing but a live target? Which I must miss. I knew that when I took the job. Won't you let me help you? Help me? Let me lend you some money. Why? We're booked solid, aren't we? That means the old lettuce will be coming in every pay-day. Of course, I could always use a little extra money. Has it ever occurred to you Al that you are not cut out for this sort of work? Why not go back to dancing? That costs dough. You may leave that entirely to me. I don't get this. Why should you put up your dough so that Connie and I can go back to dancing? I did not say you and your wife, did I? That is out. But I know now what you're trying to do and why you're trying to do it. Connie has been giving you the business, hasn't she? Well, she's not going to get away with it. Sink or swim. Survivor .. perish. The Wallaces stick together. [ Door knocks ] 15 minutes. Alright. Thank you. I've got to get made up but what I said still goes. The Wallaces stick together. So stop trying to run our lives right now. "Al stood before the mirror." "You fired and missed." "Fired and missed." "Fired and missed." What's eating you? I've had just about all of Mr Flamarion I can use. And vice-versa I should say. What goes with you and him anyway? With me and Flamarion? Don't be a sap. That guy wouldn't be interested in Venus unless she had some guns in her girdle. He just had me in his dressing room for a pep talk. Which ended up with him trying to ease me out of the act and keep you. In exchange for a little dough. Are you kidding? - Do I look like it? What a nerve that guy has got. Trying to run out lives for us. He covered up by telling me it was for my own good. What a dirty chiseller. Imagine trying to come between a husband wife that way. And the crummy way he did it. Offering you money. As though I were .. I don't know what kept me from punching him right on the nose. Honey. You know what we are going to do? We are going to quit the act. But baby, we ain't got no dough. We can't afford to quit. Now I know what sort of a man he is I won't work with him any longer. And I am surprised at you, honey. Haven't you any pride left? Yeah, but that check coming in every Tuesday .. Is the difference between meat on the table and no bread in the house. Don't worry, sugar. We'll get another job. And we'll get it quick. You are a funny kind, Connie. I don't mind telling you I had you figured all wrong. Just what did you think the score was? I don't know. But it looked to me like you were getting ready to take a powder on me. "This evening I was waiting for her at the usual time." "She did not come." "I grew more and more restless." "Time dragged." "And all that was ringing in my ear was that terrible refrain." "Repeated over and over." "Al stood before the mirror." "You fired." "And missed." "You fired." "And missed." "It taunted me." "It took possession of me." What about Los Angeles, honey? Can you make it? It's off. They offered me a Central American tour. Eddie, you can't take that. I won't let you. They were a couple of heels. Al is a good guy. But here I am hiding in dark corners with his wife. We don't have to. It wouldn't make any difference if he knew all about us. I just can't figure that way. With you it's all or nothing, huh? Yeah. That's what makes me think I'll sign for that tour. Then we wouldn't see each other for a whole year. Well, I might be able to get you out of my blood that way. Is that what you want? To get me out of your blood? It's going to be tough but it's the only way out. It's a cinch it's no good this way. So .. It is Central America. - Eddie, don't sign yet. Please. I've got an idea. Let me try and see if I can make it work. I know you and your ideas, honey. Some of them are good but .. Hey, there is Al. No matter how blind he gets he doesn't need a seeing-eye to get him to a joint. Shall I .. - No. Stay where you are. I'll handle it. Al. Over here. What are you doing here? I was waiting for you. I thought maybe I could keep you sober for a change. Eddie asked me to have a drink with him. Is there anything wrong with that? Hiya, kid. Hello Al. I was looking for you. I need some dough. I don't have any. What did you do with it? - What did I do with it? What do you think is left in our grouch bag after the way you kicked it around? For the love of Mike cut out the preaching. Hey, George. Give me a bourbon. See what the boys in the back room will have. Same here, George. Better make mine a double bourbon, George. I'm in kind-of a hurry. Okay, chum. No matter how fast you can drink it, the distilleries always stay ahead of you. Yep. But by next week I'll have them working nights to do it. Someday you're going to do that and not pull back anything but a stump. I've got something better to do than to sit here watching you get plastered. Thanks for the drink, Eddie. I'll be seeing you. You're giving yourself quite a beating, aren't you. Are you going to start that too? It's your wagon, chum. Paint it any color you want to. Look, Eddie. Do you know why I am drinking? No. And what is more .. - Then I'll tell you. It's her. Connie. She has got me bats. I don't know which end is up. What do you mean, Al? I can't tell you, Eddie. It's a question of honor. But if she don't cut out some of the stuff she's pulling. I am going to .. - You're right, Al. You should not be talking to me about it. Neither me nor anybody else. It's strictly between you and Connie. I'll be seeing you. Eddie. How's the chance of a fin until Tuesday? Sure, Al. Thanks. Now, how about me buying you a drink? No thanks, Al. I'll be seeing you later. [ Door knocks ] You are late again. Where have you been? Al was suspicious. I thought I'd never get away. I was afraid something had happened to you. We've got to be careful. Al has changed since you talked to him. He is all burned up. In all fairness to him I had to do it. - Of course you did, darling. But you've only managed to make things tougher for us. In what way? Al is forcing me to quit. I'm sure I can talk him out of that. Nobody has ever been able to talk Al Wallace out of anything. Once he makes up his mind nothing can change it. And you know what that will mean. I'll never see you again. And I can't go on without you. You won't have to. You .. you mean you have thought of a way? I'll cancel all my contracts and we'll leave the country. He'd manage to find out where we were and he'd follow us somehow. I know you don't like to be reminded of it but .. This is the past repeated. You'll grow to hate me like you did Alma. You would blame me and you would be right. No. Once, a woman you loved double-crossed you. But I am on the level. Lucky for you. Unlucky for me. I just can't let you do it. Connie. I've been thinking. So have I. We haven't a chance. There is one chance. The way you said .. The way I said? Remember your dream? Well. I have the same dream. Al was drunk. - You mean ..? Al stood before the mirror. I fired. And missed. - Don't ever say that. It was just like your dream. When did it happen? Tomorrow at the matinee. No. The Saturday night performance. Everybody lets down. I am certain Al will be drunk. Absolutely certain. Now, it's all just a matter of timing. What's the matter? - Where is Connie? But If you don't know I'm sure I wouldn't. I've looked all over the hotel for her. I need some dough. You're drunk already, Al. Why not? What else is there to do? My offer still holds, Al. Let me get you another job. I won't leave Connie. This way you are driving her away. I'll get her back. Don't you worry about little Al. Maybe you could let me have ten bucks until pay-day. Huh, boss? Sure. That's a hundred dollars. I haven't got any change. That's alright. I trust you. Me too. You are my pal. That's what I say every night. How about a drink? A cigarette to celebrate? I never smoke. Goodnight. Goodnight. Change. Change. Hello darling. What did you get me up in the middle of the night for? What's it all about? - I had to see you right away. Eddie, everything will be alright. Yeah? How come? Don't ask so many questions. Just do as I tell you. Call your agent in the morning and say you'll take that Central American tour. I don't get it. I thought you didn't want me to go. I've changed my mind. Because now I am going with you. - With me? Well, what about Al? - Al is a dead pigeon. And I'm clearing out for good. And I do mean good. He'll never let you go. You've tried that. Oh yes he will. I just found something out tonight. Never mind what it was. But you take my word for it. I have enough on him now so that when my lawyer tells him I want to go bye-bye .. He can't say no. But that is blackmail. - So it's blackmail. Has he played straight with me? Kicking me around. Taking my dough. He forced me to .. Hey, wait a minute. Who are you worrying about? Al or me? You ought to know the answer to that one. Well then. Act like it, will you. I thought I did all the drinking for the Wallace family. I kinda got the willies tonight. I thought maybe a drink might help. Are you worried about leaving the act? I wonder if I should have made you quit. - Sure you should have. When we get away from here things will be a whole lot better. There is room for improvement. Honey. I guess. You know why I act like this. I'm jealous. But once Flamarion is out of our lives it will be .. Just like it used to be when we first started out. Yeah. I bet it will at that. I know the going has been pretty tough, baby. But at least we have been together. Hey, wait a minute. What are you doing? Going sentimental on me? Maybe I got a funny way of showing it. But I am .. I'm just as crazy about you as I ever was. You know. You are kind-of a sweet kid at that. Maybe you're right. Maybe from here on things are going to be a whole lot better. [ Door knocks ] Fifteen minutes. - Okay. Well. Here is how. [ Door knocks ] Five minutes. - I know the time. Hiya, boss. Everything all set? "I was like a man who walks through a nightmare with feet of lead." "I did not speak. I did not dare to." "I simply went on." "Because now there was no turning back. Ever." Keep your mind on the act. [ Door knocks ] "Mechanically, I moved about the stage." "Like a machine." "I looked at her." "She was everything I wanted." "Then Al stood before the mirror." Al. Speak to me. Please. Close the curtains. Close the curtains. What happened? What is it? - It's Al. He's been shot. Is there a doctor in the house? Was he drunk? Various employees of the Bay Theater. Who watched the act on the night of July 9th. Have testified that Mr Flamarion's performance went as usual. In every single detail. The autopsy disclosed the presence of alcohol in the blood of the deceased. In view of this fact, it is agreed that Al Wallace's intoxication. Caused him to make a mistake in timing which led to his death. Therefore, the Coroner's verdict is: 'accidental death'. The jury is discharged. I'm sorry. Aren't you ever on time? Did you miss me very much? These last two days are the most miserable I have ever spent. I missed you too. Tickets for Las Vegas? I went to the bank this morning and I drew enough money out for a honeymoon. You shouldn't do that, darling. You shouldn't have bought tickets on the same train. It's dangerous. Then I can leave the next day and meet you there. If anyone found out that you took all that money out of the bank. And they saw us together you'd just be begging for a call from the DA. Are you afraid? No. It isn't that. Just that I don't want anything to happen to you. Nothing will I hope. You know, it might be a good idea if I did go away. But just for a little while. But I told you that I don't want to be separated from you again. Let's be sensible, darling. We've got to let the grass grow. We've got the rest of our lives to be together. When you figure it that way. Three months isn't such a long time. Three months? Do you think I like the idea of leaving you? Where will you go? Henning Minnesota. I haven't seen my mother in eight years. There never was enough time or money before. I will write you every day. - No. No letters please. Never put anything in writing. - Then I'll telephone you. Don't you understand? We've got to be strangers. Even my family mustn't know we are friends. But we'll make up for it. Connie, you haven't even given me your address. So that I know at least where you are. I'd like to send you little presents. To let you know .. That I am thinking of you. 2907 Ferndale is the address if it's any easier for you. But no gifts. Widows should not have admirers. Please take this. It will remove .. One of my worries until I see you again. And that will be exactly three months from tonight. October 14th. Where shall we meet? As far away from here as possible. What about Chicago? I love Chicago. Chicago? The Empire hotel. I will register under the name of HJ Brandt. Can you remember that? Mrs Brandt joins you in Chicago at the Empire hotel. On October 14th. My name is HJ Brandt. I have reservations. - How do you do, Mr Brandt. Your reservation is for October 14th. Yes. My wife arrives tomorrow but I'd like to check in now and prepare things. Yes. Of course. Show Mr Brandt the bridal suite. Yes, sir. This way please, Mr Brandt. Do you like it, sir? - This needs flowers. Is there a florist in the house? - Yes, sir. Tomorrow morning I want six dozen roses. Various colors. Long stemmed. I want some flowers for this vase and another basket with mixed flowers. Six gardenias for her pillow. And a standing order of a corsage. Three orchids. The best. White. To be delivered every morning with our breakfast. Yes, sir. You got that straight? - Yes, sir. Is there anything else? Yes. You can bring me some ice water. And I want good service. Thank you, sir. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Good morning, Mr Brandt. - Good morning. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Good morning, Mr Brandt. - Morning. I would like to get the schedules of all incoming trains and planes please. Yes, sir. Thank you. Anything else, sir? - No thanks. Good morning. - Good morning, Mr Brandt. Have you any mail? - No, sir. There is nothing. Have you anything under the name of Flamarion? Flamarion? - F-L-A-M-A-R-I-O-N. He asked me to pick it up for him. I don't think there's anything under that name but I will see. Sorry, Mr Brandt. There is nothing. In case anything should come let me know immediately. Yes, sir. Operator, give me the desk please. That guy in 1406 is nuts. He's done nothing but call me all day. Hello. Desk? It's Mr Brandt in 1406. Haven't there been any calls, messages or letters? Has there been anything for my friend Flamarion? Alright. Thank you. Calling Mr Grant. - Here. Mr Grant? Brandt. - Sorry, sir. It's a Mr Grant. A Mr George Grant. Calling Mr Grant. Calling Mr Grant. Calling Mr Grant. [ Telephone ] Hello? Yes. This is Mr Brandt. A telegram? Well, send it up. Telegram for you, Mr Brandt. Is there any answer, sir? 'Address unknown'. 'Addressee unknown'. Thank you, Mr Brandt. Any forwarding address, Mr Brandt? I'll let you know. - You do appreciate that .. "I had lost all sense of time." "The only excuse she could have had .. was death." "Otherwise, she had double-crossed me." "I did not know which would have been worse." "I had to find her." "I remembered her ticket to Las Vegas." "It was a wild chance but my only clue." "After I had searched for days I ended up in a gambling club." "Like the rest of the suckers." What money I didn't lose gambling .. I lost tracing Connie. Every day some racketeer gave me some new clues. All false. Then I went to Los Angeles to see the agent. Who had placed Connie and Al in my act. I'm sorry. I've tried everything. I've checked with the NVA, central casting and every agent in the business. Maybe she went back to dancing. I've covered all those angles too. There's no trace of her. Look, Flamarion. Why don't you start rehearsing with a new team? All you need is a couple of stooges who know to stand still and keep sober. Okay. Then do a single. I can book you anywhere. Get back in your own racket. And forget all this. Do you .. Do you need money? Well, I guess .. I have got to keep on looking. Well. Good luck. "I covered the country." "Seattle." "Detroit. Minneapolis." "Philadelphia. Kansas City." "Everywhere." "I was obsessed by one thought only." "The thought of finding her." That's a mighty nice set of guns you got there. What do you want to do, pawn them or sell them? Sell them. I'll give you eighty dollars. I got to keep this one. If you're breaking the set up I'll have to give you less money. I'll give you sixty. I'll take it. I never figured a smart guy like you would let a dame make a sucker of him. I don't even know whether she is dead or alive. She is alive alright. Her kind never dies. Then why can't I find her? Because you don't know what you're looking for. That's why. I don't know why I should help you but .. Here it is. Remember a bicycle act that was on the bill when we played in San Francisco? The Wheel ..? - The Wheelers. I know they had trouble finding someone to replace Eddie when he left the act. The big, good-looking one. Connie was nuts about him then. It ain't more than a year ago so she probably still is. The last thing I heard about Eddie he was some place south of the border. So, if you really want to find her. You'd better start hunting for him. But what you want with that dame after the way she crossed you up .. Is something I'll never be able to figure out. "At last I had found something tangible to guide me." "I hitch-hiked my way to the border and then I walked." "Finally, I got a ride on a truck here to Mexico City." "I made the rounds of the whole town." [ Spanish language singing ] You were going great with that guy in the wings tonight, weren't you. Why honey, he's an old friend of mine. And you didn't come in until two o'clock this morning, did you? There's such a thing as carrying a friendship too far. Why, baby. I think you are jealous. Look. You are my wife. You're not going to get away with this stuff. It has got to stop. Keep away from that acrobat. I'll do whatever my daddy wants me to do. Listen. I don't know what happened to Al and I don't want to know. But I got a darned good idea that is not going to happen to me. You understand? You're talking awful big, little man. I'm going to pick up our check. I'll be back in ten minutes. And you be here. Yes, sir. Will there be anything else, sir? Flamarion. Yes. I have changed. We both have changed. How did you get in? We had a date. Remember? I always keep my dates. I tried to get there. Three months weren't long enough to see your mother in Minnesota? You were so busy at home at that phoney address. That's it. It was too long. I was wrong to marry. All wrong. I know that now. I waited for you and .. And then Eddie came along. But I never stopped thinking about you. Never. I know how it is. You haunted me too. Every minute you were away from me made me more unhappy. I am so glad you've come. That is why I am here. I have come to get you. Of course. It was different before. Fine hotels. Nothing but the best. We'll have it all again. Just the two of us. It will be just like it used to be. We'll have our future together. Just as you had planned. Yes. We'll go back to the States. Get a new act. You'll be a headliner. Your name will be in lights again. And you will be my assistant? Of course. Then I'll have everything. Yes. Everything you want. And so will I. We will go away. You don't belong here, Connie. We. We do understand each other. Don't we? Yes. I understand. But this is one time you will keep your date. You wouldn't. You couldn't. - I'm through and so are you. No. Think. I'll never squeal on you. Ever. That is right. - Look. Just let me go. I'll give you back your money. All of it. You won't need any now. You wouldn't dare. I'll tell them you killed my husband. I'll say that you're a murderer. Then what are you? I am the last man you will ever cheat. Why, you poor sucker. How could anyone love you? A fat bull neck. Those squinty eyes. You are old. You're ugly. Even the touch of you made me sick. I hated you and I've always hated you. That was your curtain speech, Connie. Keep away from me. Keep away from me. [ Connie screams! ] What? What was that? Who screamed? I held on as .. As long as I could. Until the lights went out. Everybody had gone. All the time I was growing weaker. Loss of blood. Then I let go. Tell them. It's the police, Flamarion. I said I was going to be dead .. When they got here. Didn't I? ..t-g..
