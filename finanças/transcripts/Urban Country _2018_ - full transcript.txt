Subtitles by explosiveskull Boo! You guys are so immature. Really, Savatore? - Hey, art not vandalism. - Okay look we're here. What do we do now? I say we head for the fields. Hey guys, I've been working on my lock picking skills. You know we could just climb this. Lighten up, cut it. Look at that empty canvas. Go to it, Picasso. Hey, gonna throw this over here for a second. Oh, yeah. Take me to adventure, and to love. We too, have shared great joy and great sorrow, and now I stand at the gate of the paddock watching you run. Hey! Come on. Bobby, what's your 20? Security guard's calling for backup. You ain't afraid of no security guard. I'm not sleeping in commune again, let's bounce. Split up, split up. Here B. here. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, get off me! Fly free my friends. Fly free. Where you been? Out. Don't worry about it. Yo, what's with the tone? I worked a double last night, okay? Whatever. Andrew's looking good out there, as always. You always sabotage that kid, it always makes me look bad. I wish more people would come. You know what, these people came. It matters to them. Might be time to let this go. I don't know why I bother anymore. I'll be right back. That clown was running so hard, he was panting and sweating after like, five feet. Yeah, Faith got by the old one. Yeah, it was a real party. Hey Faith. I haven't seen you around here in a while, you've been okay? I'm fine. So, do you have any plans for like, today or tonight? - She's busy. - No, I'm not. I don't have any plans, but I can't make any either. Do you minions answer everything for her? Listen dog, you're barking up the wrong tree today, okay? Just walk away, now. You guys stop, stop. It's nothing, he's nobody, let's just get to class. Take this out, with the rest of your trash. I'm sorry, it was an accident. It always is. Get to class. I'll be keeping this. Listen, your father is not gonna give in this time. You're gonna have to call your mother. Have her come pick you up right here. Faith, if you don't call your mother, and if she doesn't pick up, you're gonna spend a little time in jail tonight, you want that? Please don't leave it up to me, 'cause if you do, you'll see the inside of a cell. Yeah. All right, I'll send him out. Your parents are here, you're free to go. This is very simple, I need you to call a relative, a grandmother, an aunt, somebody that can handle this for you. Otherwise you're gonna take a ride. You always take the hard road. You have any weapons on you? You need to change your behavior. I don't know why you do this. You're headed down the wrong path. Thanks for the tip. This ain't your first rodeo, come on, let's go. Hey this is Dave, I can't come to the phone, just leave me a message at the tone. Dad. I'm sorry. I know I messed up, but you gotta hear what happened, it wasn't my fault this time. Please just come get me, Dad. I'm Sax, and you are? Faith. What'd you do? The short of it, I pushed someone through a sheet of glass. I'm really tired, I don't wanna talk right now, I just, I wanna sleep, and hopefully when I wake up, my dad'll pick me up. Jones, Faith Jones. Guess your dad's here. Oh, give me a second I'll grab my papers. Honey, you ain't getting out. You just got a visitor. I guess your dad isn't here. Mom? Why'd you come here, I didn't call you for a reason. Dad called me, told me what you did. Said he wasn't bailing you out again, so here I am. Wanna talk about what happened? I don't wanna talk to you ever, about anything. Are you gonna bail me out, or what? Yes. On one condition. What's that? You have to come back to Mississippi with me. No, I'm fine, I'll just stay here. You really rather stay in prison than come home with me? You know, as far as county jails go, I could do a lot worse. I don't know where you learned to be so mean. Well daddy wasn't really big on etiquette growing up. I thought you'd be thrilled to get outta there, have a fresh start. I may not get another chance to tell you, and I certainly didn't want to do it like this. Tell me what? Faith, I have cancer. The doctor says I only have a few months. You're so pathetic. Really, what'd you think, you just come back here, come bouncing back into my life! Faith! Faith! You lost? Nope. But it seems you are. I'm Jose Antonio, my friends call me Tono. I'm your warden. What are you doing? I haven't done anything wrong. Well, not since I've been here, obviously I did something wrong to get here. Where are you friends this time? My friends? I don't know, guess they weren't really involved in this one. Really? When I was your age, I ran with the wrong crowd too. But somehow, I always ended up being the only one with consequences, and I took that as a sign that I was on the wrong path. Now, I'm a warden. Looking after kids who are on the same path I was. My friends, well a few of them are locked up, the rest should be. Is this your big make a change speech? Because I'm not a bad seed, I'm just a victim of being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Worst thing you can do is think of yourself as a victim. So, your story is what, this time? This guy was yelling at me and my friends, and I shut him up. Put him through a trophy case, I'm told, with your cheering squad in tow, that about right? You think they're worried about you? I don't think they're worried about you. In fact, I know they aren't. But I'm here, don't have to be. You know, I don't even really know you at all, but I'm worried about you. Well, if you decide you wanna talk to somebody, like I said, I'm here. What if I didn't wanna talk? What if I just wanted to listen? I have plenty to say. He's not coming for me. He's your father, always comes around. But you might have to meet him halfway. He's done with me. He's not done with you. He's done with your poor judgment and immaturity. How about you just do your job, instead of worrying about my relationship with my dad? Come on. Walk with me. You know Faith, there's certain things you just can't take back. Mistakes you make that you wish hadn't happened. Unlike the incident with the young man, you know how fast that coulda gone south? Put through that glass, he hits his head wrong, sharp glass could've cut his neck wide open, that young man could be dead. We'd be having a very different conversation. But he's not. He is not by the grace of God. It's not about getting punished, it's not about what is right and wrong, it's what you have to live with. What happened to you? All of the above. That's my point. It's not about getting caught, it's not about your punishment, you said it yourself, you're not a bad seed. You know what is right and wrong. It's what you have to live with for the rest of your life. The regrets that you'll have, the knowledge that you could've done something different, that you could've changed the way things turn out. Faith Jones! You're wanted in the courtroom. Miss Jones. I would very much like to see you stuck in this place for quite a bit longer. I think being in here, might be the only chance you have of getting your life together. Sir I. Don't interrupt me. Sorry. But, much to my dismay, you are free to go. Excuse me? You're victim's parents are dropping the charges against you. Why? I don't know why. I strenuously objected. But they were set on letting you off the hook. Thank you. Oh, it wasn't my decision. Still, thank you. Miss Jones. Don't let me see your face in my courtroom again. Next time, I get veto power. Good luck. Shirt. Pants. Shoes. ID. Where's my phone? Mr. Craft still has it in his office. Thanks. Don't let me see you again. You won't. Dad? Dad? Dad, are you here? Hey, you're out already? That wasn't too bad of a stay. Look, I'm not really in a chatty mood, I just need to borrow your phone or charger. No, but I got your backpack. I'm already on my way to meet Justin, so no need. We gotta get downtown and celebrate. No, I wasn't gonna call Justin, I just need to borrow your phone so I can call my mom. You can just use his phone when we get there. Come on. You know what it's like to be in jail for a couple of hours? Yeah. Add on two more days and you go it, same old same old. Although I did meet the warden, he seemed tough but he was also really sweet at the same time. He asked me where you guy were, you know, since you were in the fight with me too. Said I should be careful of who I consider my friends. I mean, we are friends, right? Yeah, of course. Ride or die. You guys gotta hear how I got out. What do you mean? Michael didn't press charges, so they had to let me go. Nobody came to pick me up. My mom visited me and she said that she wants me to go back with her. Oh, no way you're fixing to leave. Not for the country. I'll be back, It'll only be a few weeks. My mom's pretty sick, so she wants me to be there for her. Like you're actually coming back. What do you mean, I just said I am. - So much for ride or die. - Yeah. You'll have us replaced in a quick minute. Hey, you better not leave, 'cause we won't be waiting here for ya. That's not funny. So you're saying, if I go to visit my sick mother, you guys won't be my friends anymore? Whatever, if that's what you want. Mr. Craft? Hey. I heard they let you out. Apparently, Michael's parents found it a bit annoying that he let a young girl hand it to him that way. So, part of his punishment is you getting away with it. Yay for me. Do you have my phone? Actually, I do. Wanted to talk to you about that. I took a look at a couple of videos on here, just wanted to say nice job on the baseball stadium the other night. I want you to make a change, right now. You stop running with that crowd you're hanging out with, and take advantage of this new beginning. I'll do my best. All right, Faith, you might need this. Thanks for the second chance. Mom? Hey, I'm sorry for what I did to Michael, and to the field, and I'm sorry for not talking to you or visiting you. I'm sorry that I don't listen to Dad. He's forgived me. Please, I want a second chance. I'll do anything, I really wanna come home with you. So, this is it. These are all our horses. How many, exactly? 17 right now, but two are pregnant. This is Allegro. Over here, we have Magic. Come here, baby. Do they all have names? Well, of course they do. Horses are people too. Okay, I've seen enough. Blake, come say hi to my girl. Hey girl. Blake is gonna be showing you the ropes, literally. I can't believe you're gonna make me work here. You know, if you keep an open mind, you might learn a few things. Whatever, where's my room? I know it's not much, but it's comfy, and has everything you need. I'm actually supposed to live here? Well, it's better than prison. Look normally I sleep in the trailer, but the room above the stables been better for me since I've been sick. I mean, is there even a legit bathroom in there? I don't know if legit is the exact word I would use. Look, why don't you go in, get settled a bit, meet me upstairs in an hour for dinner. You've got to be kidding me. I shoulda just stayed in county. Hey, can I help you with anything? You mean like, cook? Yeah, is it weird to offer to help you cook? No I just, I didn't realize you knew how to cook. Considering I've been pretty much taking care of myself since I was seven, not knowing how to cook wasn't really optional. Sounds like your dad wasn't around much. It wasn't that he wasn't around, he was just busy, you know? He would work, come home, go to bed, repeat. Why that's the first I'm hearing of it. You shoulda told me. I wanted you here, I figured you wouldn't survive the uproot. Will you say grace? What's the point? Well, I don't have a whole lot of time left, so I'd like to show my thankfulness while I still can, even if it is over my backyard chicken. Mom, this is from the yard? That's gross. Mom. Forget it. I will bless the food. Thank you Lord for this food, and for the opportunity to create this beautiful meal together. I pray for many more experiences like today. Amen. Faith, say amen. Why, you said it. I mean, isn't He always listening? He knows the prayer's ended. Faith. Let it go. Why do you have to make a simple thing so difficult? Sorry. You're right. I really am thankful for all the things that you thanked the Lord for. Mom? How long do you have? I don't really know. It was stage four when I was diagnosed three months ago. Three months ago? You didn't tell me for three months? You should've told me the second you found out! I tried calling you, but you didn't answer. I'm sorry. I just wish I would've been there for you. What type is it? Liver. It had metastasized by the time, by the time they found it. So, yeah. You should've texted me, or emailed me, or just something, you should've tried harder. Well, I wrote you letters. Letters Mom, really? You know what, let's not talk about this tonight, all right, let's focus on something happy, like your birthday. Which is next week. I'm excited, you excited? I'm excited. I'm excited for my birthday, I'm excited to spend it with you. But, Mom, that's not enough to take my mind off of all the letters I never received, it's not. I don't know. Are you okay? You know what, I think, I think I need to go, go rest. I'm gonna go to bed. Okay? But, I will see you bright and early in the morning. Okay, well you know where to find me. Yes. I love you. I love you too, mamma. Really. Hello? Hey, wow, I wasn't expecting you to pick up. I was completely prepared to just leave a message that you would never respond to. Get quiet, now to go to your kennel muts. But, why are you calling, Faith? It's just, Mom said she wrote several letters. Enough dog, settle down! Let me go take care of this crazy dog, okay? Get it quiet down before it wakes the whole building, sorry. Of course. Yeah, I'll call you later. Bye. Hey, horsie. How ya feeling? Look what I have. Yes, this is a bribe. You missed it. That a girl, I mean boy. You're such a good horsie, and I'm talking to a horse, that's pretty weird, yeah? Pretty weird. Morning, kiddo. How'd you sleep? Pretty good. Where's my mom? She is still in bed, actually. Wanted to get a little extra rest. She's got a treatment later today, and it really kinda make her nauseated, so the day after's not so good. That's rough. Who usually takes her? I do, or Corey. We're a family, right? Well, I kinda want to start taking her, if that's cool? Yeah, it's fine. In the meantime, you got a long list to tend to. Whatever you say, boss. Can we do this without being sarcastic? It came straight from your mom, I'm just the messenger. Sorry, old habits die hard, you know? Nope, I don't know. I don't really care. I just wanna make sure we get all this stuff done, so your mom doesn't have to come home, and be worried about it. That's what I want, too. Where should I start? Gross, oh my gosh! I got it all over my new sneakers, these are my best ones. Okay so, before we get started, obviously, we're gonna need to get you dressed for the part. Why are you being so mean? I mean, I've never had a reason to have any other type of shoes, why would I have farmer boots? Okay, you're right, I'm sorry. There is a Western store in town, I want you to head down there, we've got a account open for the ranch, you can just charge it to us. Get dressed, and we will start this day over again. Okay, but how will I get there? Right, Corey's in the truck. Why don't you take the tractor? You're kidding me, right? A tractor, you want me to take a tractor into town? You could walk the eight miles. Whatever works for you, works for me. Okay, I can do this. Don't let a tractor outsmart you. First I'm talking to a horse, now I'm negotiating with a tractor. Why am I even here? Okay. I did it! Hey, you must be Corey. Is there any way that we could switch cars? Sure yeah, no problem. I am Corey, by the way. Your mom talks so much about you, I feel like I kinda already know you. Well, really my mom doesn't even know me. Oh, sorry, I don't mean to be rude, or annoying, or anything. Just letting you know your mom's proud of ya, that's all. Is there any way you can take me into town? Sure. I'd like that. Just get your door. Thanks. Corey. I'm Faith, nice to meet you. Likewise, where you headed anyway? The Western Store. I assume you're going into town to get some new clothes, right? Is it that obvious? Yeah. Well, let's get going. Put your seatbelt on. This is the first red light I've seen since I've been here. Is it the only one? No, I think there's another one down 47. So, how's my mom, is she okay? Oh, she's great. She has the most wonderful doctor. Her and Dr. Keith have been friends for years, he takes real good care of her. She's in great hands. Has he been a doctor for a while? As long as I've known her. How long is that? Well, I've been working on the ranch since I was seven, and I'm almost 19, so a really long time. She's like a second mother. - Thank you, Corey. - For what? For being there for my momma when I wasn't. Oh, it's my pleasure. She's always been so good to Blake and I, treat us like sons. Does she really talk about me? Oh yeah, all the time. Here we are. Did you really think you were gonna take the tractor into town? Huh? You're funny, you know that? You guys don't actually take the tractors into town? No, not at all. Hope my driving didn't scare ya. No. Alright, this aisle. Okay. - Oh my gosh. - Just watch your head. People actually buy this stuff, like people actually dress like this? Clearly, I don't. But I don't know about everyone. This is where your mom shops for everything, actually. Really? It's good to know. Okay, so, what all do I need? I'd say a straight pair of jeans, and definitely boots, and maybe even a hat, to keep the sun out of your eyes. That's shades and a flat perm are for. Okay so, hat, boots, and sparkly denim. All right, there you go. - Oh, I got those. - Oh, there you go. Good to see you, Cor. Thank you for your help, I couldn't have gotten all of this without you. You're welcome, you just go ahead and get back to the big city, before you hurt yourself or anybody else, okay? Thanks for today. I actually really had fun. Me too. Maybe we can do it again, sometime. Yeah. You need anything, just give me a holler, I'll be in the ring working the horses. I'm gonna change and start working my way through your brother's to do list. Ooh, that should be fun. Doubtful, he has it out for me. I'm not his favorite person. I don't think anyone in this town actually likes me. I'm sure he likes you just fine. He's just a stickler for work, and in general, not a very friendly person. People in this town, they're just not used to your type around here. My type? - You know what I mean. - Yeah, I know. So, don't try to make small talk, and always have your work done on time, and perfectly. Sounds like my time here trying to please your brother, and this whole town's gonna be pleasant. I'm so used to him, that I don't even realize how serious he is anymore. Thank you, too. For what? For hanging out with me. I normally don't hang out with a lot of people, aside from my brother and your mom, and even though I love them, it's nice to branch out every once in a while. One, clean stalls. Thanks for going easy on me, Blake. Two, feed horses. Three, swim Magic. Four, catch chicken for dinner? Corey! Corey! What, what happened? Your brother is absolutely insane. Why? What'd he tell you to do? Oh, clean the stalls, swim a horse, catch a chicken for dinner. That all sounds pretty average to me. Average? This is all so disgusting. What were you expecting to do? I don't know, water plants, brush the horses' manes. I mean feed them I'm okay with, but catching a chicken for dinner? We do that every night actually, it's not that bad. You mean, the chicken we ate last night was just playing around minutes before we ate it? Faith, we live on a ranch. We own horses, we eat dinner, dinner that comes from a chicken coop, that's why they're there. If you ever have scrambled eggs, they'll also come from the same chicken coop, and well bacon, well, you get it. We raise animals with the intent to eat them. No, no I'm sorry. I can't do this, I don't have the stomach. Look Faith, Blake is gonna come back expecting all of this to be done. I'll help you out, show you how to do everything, and you'll be just fine. I don't wanna let down my mom, Blake, or you, but this is all so nasty. Stay in there, boy. Look. Here. Take this, go stall by stall, and scoop up all the hay, and put it in the wheelbarrow, and just take everything you can, out. I can't believe I have to do this, this is so unsanitary. My dad had a dog I had to clean up after, because he never did, and I had a hard time stomaching that. This is on a whole other level. Next up, you need to learn how to feed them. Okay great, so now we're gonna reload them, thanks Blake. Are you interested in brushing them? Actually, I am. I've always liked the idea of horses, they're beautiful and intriguing, but obviously a total mystery because I've been completely clueless. Here. Have at it. See? They love it. These horses are real spoiled rotten. Kinda actually always been your mom's babies. Sorry, I hope I didn't offend you. No, it's okay. I wasn't there, she had to love something. I gotta say, this is the funnest thing I've done all day, besides shopping with you. Me too. So, ready to go catch our dinner? You had to say that. Now or never, I guess. So sometimes, they come out and sometimes, they don't. Looks like you'll actually have to go in and catch yourself a chicken today. Must be my lucky day. So, are you gonna help me or not? Or not. Come on Faith, it'll serve you to get used to this, and to get good at it. You'll have more time for other things like spreading the stables. You know how to get to me. Okay. Awesome, you're a natural. I can't believe I caught a real, live chicken. Good job, now we just have to harvest it. Ew. Hand him over. - Okay. - Okay, ready? - Oh, sorry. - Oh, wait. Well, you're on your own now. I'm gonna go tend to the horses. Catch up with me once you track that thing down, okay? Oh my gosh. Hey chicken. Hi. Hi, no, no. Okay. Come in. Hey. Hey baby. How was your day? Good, I've been praying for you. How are you feeling? I'm sorry, mamma. I wish you would let me come with you, I want to take care of you like Blake and Corey. Oh baby, don't you worry about me, okay? I'm fine, I promise. I don't think so. You don't tell me everything, but Corey isn't so secretive. Mom, I know things are bad, and I know that you're not telling me everything. You know Faith, let's not talk about this tonight, okay? Tonight it is just me and you. Alright, we're just gonna, we're gonna keep praying, and we will make it through this, one way or another. I'll keep praying for you. I love you Mom, and I'm feeling really guilty that I haven't been here. Baby, come here. I'm really happy we got to spend all this time together. Yeah, me too. You know, there is something that I wanna talk to you about. Yeah, anything. Corey. Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah. You really like him, don't you? He invited me to his youth group dance thing. What? Are you gonna go? I don't really know how to dance in a way that's acceptable by anyone in a youth group. Well, I can teach you. Come on. Let's go. - Okay, all right. - Okay. Hand here. What do I do? You just follow my feet. Slow. I'm gonna miss you, Mom. Oh baby. I'm always with you. - I love you. - I love you too, mamma. Blake, your wake up calls are getting earlier and earlier. This is not a wake up call for work, Faith. I need to tell you something. I don't really know how to say it. Can you say it quickly please, because I'm assuming the worst. Your mom passed away last night, Faith. I'm so sorry. What? No, no we were just dancing last night, she had more time. I know, I'm sorry. No, I don't wanna talk right now, I need to think. Faith, Faith. I wasn't even there. There's no way you coulda known it was gonna happen when it did. Look, we all thought we had more time. I haven't been a good daughter, and now she died, and I didn't even get to say goodbye. I'm sorry. Corey and I were there. Well, at least her honorary children were there. Faith, come on. Faith, look. I just need to process this myself. Just go away Blake, I'm gonna call my dad. Okay. Let us commend Anna Jones to the mercy of God. Lord, our God, you are the source of life. Keep us in life and death in your love, and by your grace lead us to your kingdom, through your son, Jesus Christ, our Lord. We therefore commit her body to the ground. Earth to earth. Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust. The sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life. You're late. I've been here, in the background. I'm so sorry about your mamma, baby. I wasn't even there with her. I feel so horrible. Blake and Corey were the ones who were with her. Your momma knew that you loved her, baby. You didn't have to be there with her to feel it. I know, I just never talked about her dying. I wasn't ready. She was, I mean, she seemed so peaceful. You should want that for her. I did, but I just wish I would've gotten to say goodbye. A lot of people sure did show up today. Yeah. I know she was kinda like, she was kinda like the town mother. Everyone loved her and the ranch. I bet they did. Do you have my letters? Somehow I knew you'd be asking for these. Why'd you keep these from me? I don't know, I guess I was just trying to protect you. Trying to protect me from harmless mother. Maybe protect is the wrong word. I obviously had my reasons, at the time. I'm sorry. Thanks. At least I can read them now. Look, you know, you're gonna have to come back with me now, you can't stay here. What? Why? It's not like the ranch is going anywhere. I turn 18 tomorrow, so it's my decision. Mine. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sound rude, I just, I really don't wanna talk about this right now. I understand. We'll talk about it tonight, okay? Look, I know that I haven't been the most reliable father. I didn't really welcome you into our home. I'm sorry. But I promise, I'll work on it, okay? I'll be absent if you'll come back with me. That means a lot to me. It really does. I'll go pack my bags. I love you. Hi, Faith. My name's Earl Bick, and on behalf of our entire family, I'd just like to extend our condolences on the loss of your mom. She was loved by everybody. If love would keep people alive, she'd be here today. God bless you. - Hey. - Hey. Got a minute? Yeah, is everything okay? Yeah no, it's fine. Just someone I want you to meet. Who? It's your mom's lawyer. Faith. I can't even explain how sorry I am for your loss. Your mother was truly one of a kind. There's no one like her, not possible. Now I know this is all really fresh, and I'm not trying to make it harder or more uncomfortable. But we really need to go over the details of your mother's will. Of course, I'll read it right now. Well, it's actually a tape. She filmed it herself. Of course she did. She thought it'd be easier for everybody, if it were in her own voice. Gotta love her. Hi everyone. Faith, Blake, Joan, Corey. I am so sorry that you guys are having to endure this. I wanted nothing more than to stay with you all. But, here we are. Faith, sit down honey, 'cause what I'm about to tell you is gonna knock you off your feet. Are you sitting? Okay Mom, I'm sitting down. The ranch is yours. Every horse, truck, trailer, the house, heck even Blake and Corey belong to you now. My parents gave it to me, and now it's time for you to have it. Sorry boys. It's okay, Anna. I knew you'd understand, Blake. She really does know us. I love you all so much. Faith, honey, I'm sorry we didn't get more time together. You have always been my everything. Now, I know this is a lot, and you probably have a million thoughts running through your head about how you can take care of the ranch, how you get Corey and Blake to work you for you. But don't you worry, I have a plan. I didn't have the strength to get it done, but you can. Joan, please give her the letter. That letter explains everything. All right, don't be afraid. You're stronger than you know. Plus you have the boys to help. You three stick together. Oh. Money. You have a few years cushion, before you even need to think about money. I hope you understand Blake, I have to take care of my girl. Okay. Well, I love you all. Joan, as much as I loved hearing my mother's voice, and being reminded of how much she loves me and believes in me, I cannot run a ranch. I mean, I cannot do this. You can always say no. Just renounce the will. Say you don't wanna take ownership of the ranch. What will happen if I do that? To Blake, to Corey, the horses, the ranch? I think your father's the next of kin. My dad? No. My head's literally spinning like a top. I can't breathe, I'm sorry, I can't do this. When horses die, they breathe. When grasses die, they wither. When suns die, they go out. When people die, they sing. Faith, you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Just listen. Look, I already know about the will okay? We already have a plan. So you just renounce the will, and you go home with me, okay? Everything will be fine, you won't have to worry about this place again. Why, so you can own all this? No Dad, that's not what I want, that's not what I want at all. I wanna stay here, and I wanna do that for myself, for Mom, for Corey and Blake, the horses, and this whole town. Unpack the car. Be serious, Faith, I mean come on. You don't know anything about a farm, or horses, except for the fact that you like to draw them on the side of buildings. I wanna stay here, and I love you, and I miss you, and I'm so happy that you wanna change your lifestyle for me, but you need to do that for yourself, and I wanna do this for myself. Please understand. I understand, and I agree with you. I guess I just hoped you'd change your mind. Well you didn't, and you can't. I'd love for you to stay, I mean you wanted us to spend more time together. I mean, but this is my home. It feels more to me like a home than any place I've ever lived, with our without you and Mom. Okay. Okay. Gotta go make dinner. Here chickie, chickie. Hey. Come here. Come on, chicken. Hey chicken. I got ya, got ya chicken. What the? Justin, Oliver? What are you wearing, sis? What did they do to you? You hiding somewhere under all that denim? Is that a chicken? Well, nice to see you too. We heard about your mom. Just wanted to make sure you're doing okay. Yeah, I mean well, we figured we'd be staying like, I don't know, about a week or so, you know. See what you've been up to. Yeah, okay. You can just stay in the trailer, and I'll take my mom's room. Dude we get to sleep in a trailer, sweet. What are you doing? I swear, you two act like five year olds. Lighten up, Faith. We're just having some fun, no big deal sis. No, you can't treat the horses like that. Those things get away from you so fast, oh my god. Hey. Why'd I find this horse roaming around by itself? They didn't know what they were doing, and they accidentally let it out of its stall. But I stopped it before anything happened. Look, they need to go Faith, all right? They can't stay here. We've got enough to deal with, without some poorly reared teens running around. Blake, I can't do that, they're my friends. Yeah well, you're gonna have to decided. Them or me. Blake, you know I can't do that. I'm gonna go put this horse up and I'm gone. Come on, buddy. I don't wanna let you down Mom, but I'm not sure if I can do this. I'm not as strong or as smart as you. I love you, Mom. I promise that I'm trying to take care of this place for you. I'm trying. Hey Corey, I was thinking you might be Blake. No. He wasn't up for coming himself, but I needed to get a few of our things. I'm trying to call him, but he won't answer. Will you please just tell him that I've called? He knows. He just needs some time to figure things out. This ranch has always been everything to Blake, Anna too. I know, I know just please. Just tell him I've called and I'm trying. Maybe just give it a few days. I have to support Blake, I hope you understand that Faith. What do you mean? It means I can't be coming around and helping out, not right now anyway. Blake needs to know I'm on his side. His side? Corey, I don't even understand why there are sides! But you know what, you do what you have to do. I'm really sorry, Faith. Yeah whatever, just go away. See you around. Corey, Corey? Yeah? What's in there? Storage. Anna kept all of her stuff crammed in there, pictures, books, clothes, gifts, stuff like that, why? Just wondering. I miss you. I remember this. Faith? Faith? Dude I told you, she isn't here. You guys, hey I'm over here. It's like walking into a sandstorm up in here. I know, it's pretty gross, but look at this stuff I found. What is it? My baby stuff, it's pretty much all my mom's. She used to throw these huge rodeos, and everyone in town would come. It was like a huge party, basically. Why don't you try to do something like that? I'd love to, but I've got so much to do, and I'm all on my own. You're really not, though. I know y'all are here, and I know y'all wanna help, but y'all don't know anything about a rodeo, about a ranch. But I mean, we're willing to stay, to help you out. You can teach us. I don't really have any knowledge to pass on, I'm pretty clueless. I think you know more than you think you do. I do know that these outfits y'all are wearing, are not gonna get you very far. You want us to ditch our threads for farm clothes, don't you? It's not optional. I promise. They're really big, and definitely not your style, but it's gonna have to work. Blake. - Hey - Hey. What are you doing here? Well, I was thinking, and I wanna come talk to you. Thought you might need some help, but looks like you got it covered. No, no Blake, I'm really happy you're here, I've been trying to talk to you. Do you wanna talk now? Yeah, why don't I give you a hand on that truck. I'm really happy you're here, Blake. No one knows this ranch like you. Oh, that's no lie. I've been thinking, and as much as I'd like to honor my mother's gift, I can't. What are you saying? This has been your home, and Corey's too. You deserve to own this place, officially. I drew this up last night. I wasn't sure if I was gonna give it to you 'til I saw you today. Are you sure this is what you wanna do? It's the right thing to do. You and Corey deserve this place, and this place deserves you. I can't tell you how much this means, how much it's gonna mean to Corey. Wow, you're really in your element here, Faith. I didn't know your mom but, if she saw you with these horses, I'm sure she'd be so proud of you. We want this to work for you sis, so put me to work. I second that. I thought this would be easy, but now that you guys are in front of me, it's gonna be hard. Faith, what's wrong? I feel comfortable leaving the ranch in your hands. I mean, it's safer with y'all than it ever has been with me. I'm not really needed here. Of course you are. Not for the ranch to function. I need to borrow two things from you guys. What do you need? Well, for starters the truck, and I'd really rather you guys figure out what the other thing is, tomorrow, once I'm gone. You're leaving? I have to. I mean, being here isn't me, and being with my dad isn't me either. I just want to take some time to myself to figure out where my life is going. I wish you'd reconsider, we do need you here. - I promise to visit. - Yeah. He'll be okay. You need to do what's right for you. Thank you, Blake. We will miss you, kiddo. Right. Hey. Came to see if you needed any help packing. I'm done, I'm good. Still can't believe you're leaving tomorrow. What do you think your dad's gonna say? He'll probably act similar to you, he'll have his reservations, and he'll miss me, but he'll know it's for the better. I understand, I'm not happy about you leaving, but I understand why you need to go. I'm gonna miss you. Thank you for being so nice to me when I first got here, it really meant a lot to me. Of course. I'm gonna miss you too. Feel like making it up to me? What do you mean? The dance. You missed it. - Oh, not the dance. - Yeah. You rodeo people will dance anywhere. Humor me. Put your mom's dance lesson to good use, make her proud. Here we go. Blake, Corey, I'm sorry guys. I hope that you weren't too attached. I love you both, and I'll really miss you. Welcome back. Glad you're here by choice today, not because you have to be, that's a good sign. I was hoping you wouldn't be busy. Never too busy. Thank you, you may not think that you did much for me, but you did so much. I was too stubborn to be thankful but I am now. No need. Happy to make a difference. My mom died. She left me a huge ranch. It's beautiful, but I can't keep it, I don't even know what I would do to keep it going. I can't live in her house without her there. On the bright side, I'm gonna travel a lot. Where you planning to go? I kind of just wanna end up everywhere. It'll be good for you. Teach you a lot about yourself, hopefully all good. Thank you, warden. Keep up the good work. Back at ya, little lady. - Dad? - In here. - Hey. - Hey. Let's just go out and have some fun. All right. What are you thinking? That's the surprise. Hey. I know this isn't the best time or place to have a serious conversation, but I have to tell you something. Yeah, what is it? I wanna take some time to myself. I'm 18 and I wanna get to know me. I'm kind of craving a new adventure, as cliche as it sounds. I get it. I'm a little bummed that you're not coming back with me, but I support you. Thanks, Dad. It's not like I'm never coming home, I'll be back in a few months. Where are you gonna go? I kind of just wanna end up everywhere. I'm really excited to travel, and when I get back, I'm gonna finish school and see where life goes from there. Every journey begins with one step. Subtitles by explosiveskull
