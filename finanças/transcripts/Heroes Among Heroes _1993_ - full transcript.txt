[upbeat Chinese themed music] [narrator] Near the end of the Ching Dynasty, there was a large influx of opium into China, and a large amount of silver left China. The country was rapidly becoming poor, and people's standard of living was deteriorating. This, in turn, led to a breakdown in law and order. China saw the need to ban opium, so in the 18th year of the Emperor Tao Kwong's reign, special commissioner Lin Ze Xu was sent to Canton to enforce an Imperial opium ban. [suspenseful music] [drum beating] [drums beating continues] [beating fades] -Your Honor. -Master Wong. I would thank you for your warm welcome. I shall need your full cooperation if we're to succeed with the opium ban. You can count on me, sir. As head of the martial arts association, I shall do my utmost to wipe out the sickness that is destroying us. Good. We shall work together to get rid of opium. -Right? -[men shouting] Destroy opium! Strengthen China! Destroy opium! Strengthen China! Destroy opium! Strengthen China! Destroy opium! Strengthen China! [shouting continues] [men cheering] [boat horn blows] -[cheering continues] -[man] Hello! [men conversing] [man] Greetings! -This is the government permit. -Oh. -Very good! [laughing] -[men applauding] [men shouting] [clubs blow] -Let's go! -Come on! -Protect them! -Right! [loud bangs] [dramatic music] [crowd shouting] [music continues] Come on! Come on, you! [man] The commissioner has arrived! [music fades] -[chuckles] Master Wong. -Welcome, Your Honor. [tense music] -Out of the way! -Out of the way! Let me, teacher. [chuckles] Excuse me. Okay, brothers! Let's destroy the opium now! [shouting] [gates crashing] Come on! Come on! -Druggies! -Come on! Come on! Upstairs! [shouting continues] [laughing] Get outta here! [music intensifies] -Burn it. -Yes, sir! [cheering] [people chattering] Come on. Move it up. Move it up there. That damned Lin Ze Xu and Wong Fei Hong have cost us great losses today. If the ban isn't lifted soon, I'll order my fleet to sail into the harbor and show them how powerful our guns are. We mustn't cause an international incident. You need a Chinese to deal with the Chinese, and better still an officer. I think he means the 12th Prince. But he's miles away in Peking. What can he do? Anyway, by the time he arrives-- [man] His Highness, the prince! [door opens] [all] Your Highness! [groans] You shouldn't be frightened by a mere commissioner. And Wong Fei Hong is nobody. They are not strong enough to stop us. Besides, Lin Ze Xu is a Han Chinese. He can't fight against me. A man-- But Wong Fei Hong is a tough fighter. He's nothing to me. Let me tell you this. I also have a tough fighter on our side. He is known as Beggar So. With him we need not fear Wong Fei Hong. [together] Very clever! [man] I wonder what he wants. [people applauding] [chuckling] Thank you, everybody, thank you very much for coming today. [chuckles] First, to all you charitable people, let me say I'm honored to have you here. [chuckles] The reason I've asked you here today is to introduce to all of you a drug which I've been working on for a long time, the magnificent anti-opium pill! -[all murmuring] -Poor Kwan. Since he married into that family, he's suffered even more than when he was a beggar. That's why he made those pills, to earn himself a name and get out from under. [laughs] Quiet, please. Quiet, everybody. Be quiet. Now, I witness every day the harm that opium does to our people. It's sad. It really makes me want to cry. So I've spent countless sleepless nights, as well as money, trying to come up with a solution, and I tell you, this does work! So, we're saved at last! -[cheering] -And China will be saved! -But... -[cheering, applause subsides] ...too bad the drug is not cost-effective. It costs too much to make. Ordinary smokers may not be able to afford it. -[disappointed murmuring] -That's a shame. Therefore, I've asked you all to come here today to contribute to a charitable cause. -If you have money, give it! -[shouting affirmations] -Help in any way you can! -[shouting continues] Support the Sos! Support me, the son-in-law! That is me! Support me! Support this worthy cause! [yells] Ah! -Ohh! -You okay? [groans] -[indistinct chatter] -[groaning] Support me! Get away! Get away! Get off him! I see you've undertaken something. So he wants you to support him, to be a real man. What were you yelling so loudly for? You trying to defy me? You want to control me, huh? You want to help people? You just want their support. I think you're just doing it for yourself. Check if the young master's up and tell him to come and eat. So you want to defy me. Please, Jean, let me get up. All right? I don't want my son to see me like this. It's embarrassing. You're the embarrassment 'round here, selling phony drugs! -Get up! -[groans] All you know is money. -Ah, honey bun. -Son! -[Jean] You're up already? -Hi. Hey, what is it this time? What is it you've done? Your father will ruin the So family one day. Hmm? What are you doing? You only sit after me! Hey, Auntie, sit down. Relax. -Dad, sit down. -You don't know what he's done. He's broken our family rule. The very first, don't get involved in politics. No, no, no, look. I just made those pills because I believe they'll make a name for our family. Hey, you mean you've successfully made -the anti-opium pills? -Don't you believe in that. What anti-opium pills? They're just a laxative. Uh, you shouldn't do something like that. It's fraud. You'll get us all into trouble. It won't kill anybody. Just loosen up the bowel movement. -It cleans up the system. -Shut up! I was talking to your son! You shouldn't cut in like that! -But he's my son! -All right, calm down, both of you. Let's eat, huh? [both grunting] Stop fighting. There's plenty of food. I thought I was the beggar. But you're worse than me. You two look as if you haven't eaten for three days. -[grunting] -[coughing] -Have you two finished then? -I-- I have. -I'm off. -Hey! Hey, where are you going, son? You haven't eaten any! You crazy? Don't you remember? It's the 15th. -He has to go beg, you old fart! -Oh, yeah-- Yeah! -Enough! -You're living in a daze! All right! Don't use bad language! -So what if I do, huh? -[indistinct, groans] Hey, you ready? -Yeah, yeah, I'm coming. -Ain't got all day. -Mr. Chang! -Hi, Mr. Wong! -You're looking very prosperous. -[man 1] A Beggar's giving money out? [man 2] That's Beggar So. The So family are the richest people here. He's the only boy in the family, so the granddad, being superstitious, believed a fortune-teller and adopted a beggar to be the boy's Godfather. On every first and 15th of the month he has to go and beg. [people chattering, laughing] Hey, here we are. -Come on! Food time! -[cheering] Hey, a roast goose! Come on! [chattering, cheering continue] Hey, don't fight. There's plenty for everyone. Come on. Don't fight. I'll have a bite! Mmm! [both grunting] [water splashing] -Hey! Careful, Dad! -[grunting] No! [men cheering] Yeah! Great! [laughing] [moans] Dad, the two strikes you taught me last time were excellent! -Of course! -Thanks! But one goose is not really enough for all of us. Well, I've come prepared. Here, catch! How's that? Is that enough? Wow. Did you see how my Godfather catches them? His kung fu is really amazing. He's a real master, for sure. [laughing] Son, now so far I've taught you almost everything I know. I must say, I never thought I'd have an heir to carry on my skills. But, Dad, you're a true master. If you agree to come out of retirement, I'm sure the Beggars Clan would once again become famous. Mmm. [laughing] I'm an old man now. If I were ten years younger, maybe I would set up a branch. Right! We'd be famous again! Now, you must have a drink with me, and you can't say no. But, Dad, you know I don't drink! I'll get drunk easily! No, Dad, you're wasting it. Don't do that. All our clan members drink. I really can't drink. It has nothing to do with being a beggar. Hey, listen to me, boy. Wine takes you to another world. If you don't drink, -you'll never know the clan. -No, Dad. -Come on! Drink now! -No! That's it! [yells] You're gonna waste it. Stop it, get off me! -Get them off, huh? -Master, the Fire Lotus gang, -they're having another ritual. -They're having a parade too! -What's that? -For donations in return for their blessings! It's obvious they want to drive us out of business. [Godfather] Really? -Yeah. -Huh? Hey! Where you going? Hey! You keep away from those people! [sighs] The Fire Lotus are pretty strong. He should find out about those people. Can't just go in and confront them. [cheering, laughing] [drums beating] [jovial music] [music continues] [man 1] Hey! What's going on? Is there some kind of celebration? [man 2] Well, haven't you heard? It's the Fire Lotus parade! [man 3] Hey, let's find a good spot, teacher! Hey. [music continues] [fireworks crackling, exploding] [applause, cheering] Here they come! Wonderful! [applause, cheering] [man] Make way. Make way. Make way. [applause continue] -Is that the holy girl? -Yeah! It must be! [man murmurs] The holy girl. [woman] Excuse me! Clear the way, please! -Excuse me! Thank you! -[crowd murmuring] [fingers clicking] Hey, teacher! Foreign women! Look, sir! -Ready? -[photographer] Yeah. [groaning] [explosion] -[crowd gasping] -[woman gasps] The Holy Mother is here! [crowd murmuring] Oh, Holy Mother, give us your blessing. [chanting] Holy Mother, give us your blessing. -[chanting continues] -This is nonsense. These people are all phonies. You mustn't believe them. Kwan. [chanting continues, murmured] -You're evil, you're possessed by foreign generals! -Shut up! [grunting] You've broken the law by assaulting me! Huh? All these people can be witnesses. Now let's peel off their masks, expose their true face, and I shall write about their evil doings in my paper. [man shouting] -[crowd gasping] -Stop that! [yelling] [crowd laughing] [romantic music] Hmm. Hey! [crowd murmuring] Greetings. My dear friends, the Fire Lotus are performing this ritual to give blessings to the general public. It is all in the interests of the people. Now, to get the blessings, we need the Holy Mother, who is the divine messenger from heaven, to beat the drum 49 times consecutively. You can try, but ordinary people -can't do it. -Teacher, you try it. Oh, yeah, I don't believe it. -I'll try. -Please. [crowd continues murmuring] [yells] Hyah! Ow! -It's a trick. She used darts. -What? Really? [groaning] Let's not waste time. So now let's have the Holy Mother beat the blessing drum for us. -Let me try! -[loud bang] [drums beat] It's not so hard! Hey! [drums beating] [crowd gasping, cheering] Hyah! [shouting] [loud bangs] [banging continues] He really can fight. Right, teacher? [drums beating, loud bangs] -[men] Yeah! -Stop him! [shouting continues] [banging] [drums beat] That's enough. You've proved your point. [loud banging] [drum beating] [drum beating] [men shouting] -Hyah! -[loud bangs] [loud crash] [man shouts] Everybody, outta here! [crowd screaming] [explosion] [men yelling] [groans] [woman yells] Teacher, there's many casualties! -Take them to the clinic. -Right. [people groaning] -[man] Oh, no! -Okay, okay. Careful. Easy, easy. Come on. [groaning continues] The serious ones inside! Oh, my leg! Steady now. Teacher, this one's dying. It's okay. You gotta come, sir. I can't handle this one. [men groaning] He's over there. [man shouts] Oh, man! My leg! [sobbing] Oh, please, Master Wong, my son's bleeding to death! Can you deal with her? Please, you've gotta help me. You've gotta do something! Come on, madam. He'll be fine. He's gonna die! [men screaming] [screaming continues] -The powder! -Oh! Here. [woman continues sobbing] [screaming intensifies] [men chattering] [woman] Oh, my God! Master Wong, how is my son now? -Will he ever be able to walk? -Don't worry. He'll be fine. We've stopped the bleeding. But, uh, he won't walk for six months. Thank you, Master Wong. [melodic music] [man] In the corner. Over there. So Chai, you-- you're a reckless, bigheaded fool! -[slaps] -[gasps] [chuckles] Here, son. Your tea. -Tea, Master Wong? -Hey, come here, Dad. Why are you serving tea yourself? -Where are all the servants? -Look. We'll be having a major discussion. I don't want any outsiders here. -[chuckles] Master-- -Let me do the talking. I can handle this. Master Wong, you don't go for the villains, but instead, now you blame me. -That's not fair. -He's right. Of course, the Fire Lotus are at fault, but you caused a disaster. I told everybody to leave. It's not my fault they're so slow. Hey, no excuses. We were there. I think you should compensate the victims. Ah, finally the truth comes out. What he's after is money. So how much? Huh? -Tell us. -You're wrong. Of course, you should compensate the disaster victims. But still, in order to calm people down, you should publicly apologize to them. -Right. -Oh! So, is that all you want? Well, that's simple. You can count on me. Hey, come here, son. [chuckling] My son, this is a good deal. All he wants is an apology. So we don't have to pay anything, right? I always say "sorry" to Jean. It's no big deal. -It's like acting. -Look, Father, you're already an embarrassment to the family. If I submit to that too, people will say the So family men are no use. -Think so? -Yes, of course! -Then no apology. -No way! -No way! Of course, come on. -Of course. Master Wong, my son says he won't apologize, but he will pay compensation. But, Master, if your son doesn't come out and apologize to people, it may be difficult for him to stay in Fu Shen. What? That was an accident! You can't hold me responsible! Right! Don't you feel anything for the dead and the dying? Are you threatening me? This is no threat, pal! Calm down, young man! We can talk this over. You should learn to control your son! -[groans] -You asked for it. [loud banging] Master Wang, what kind of teacher are you? Can't your students fight? -You're too much! -[both grunting] [intense music] [both shouting] -No, no, stop! -It's okay, sir. Don't worry. My master's not gonna kill your son. No, my son might kill him! [grunting] Very good. Wong Fei Hong, the Tiger of Canton is really as good as they say. [chuckles] -[Wong] Who are you, sir? -[man] You fool! Kneel down! This is the 12th Prince here. It's all right. I came here especially to see So Chai. I'm sorry that we disturbed you. Ah! [chuckling] Your Highness, I'm so honored by your presence here. -They were just fooling around. -As you have business here, I won't delay you. I'll talk to you later. Well, let me see you out. Well, Brother So, since I last saw you in Peking, your kung fu has improved very considerably. Thank you, sir. You flatter me. Look, I'm sorry. My son is too cocky. But he's not a bad boy, you know. Just leave it to me. He'll apologize. Your son is a very good fighter, but he's overconfident. I agree. I know that. This way, sir. So that's what happened, Your Highness. So do you think I should be held responsible? Hmm... It seems that this Wong Fei Hong is a very righteous man. Hmm? Oh, why do you say that? Well, he's come here and asked you to apologize to the victims. Well, if he was, he should have intervened then. I think he's just using this incident to gain credit for himself. Well, not everybody is like you and me, Brother So, because we're real. But some want that fame and they will go to any lengths. Ah, that's why I admire you so much, Your Highness. And I feel the same for you. -Come, let's have a drink together. -Hey, you know I don't drink. Hey, Madam Bo, is the girl pretty or not? -Of course she is. -You know I'm very picky. So if I'm not satisfied with her, I won't pay you, and I do mean that. -Don't say I didn't warn you. -Oh, I'm sure you'll like her. -Sir, inside. -[chuckles] Thank you. [chuckles] Thank you. Uh, waiter! [laughing] So, where is she? Come on. Show me. There. The one reading the newspaper. You see her? Ah. [chuckling] She must've been brought up overseas. She's dressed like one of them, huh? Oh, yes. She says she wants to know what an arranged marriage is. That's why she's agreed to come. -Miss Yi? -Madam Bo. I'm so sorry we're late. We were held up in traffic. It's true. I'm sorry. Shouldn't keep a lady waiting. [chuckles] -How are you today? -[splashes water] Uh, I'm very sorry. Madam Bo, this girl doesn't seem very polite. She's asking me how I'm going to die! Oh, maybe we misheard her. You try saying something. Go on, see. Try it. Go on. All right. Huh, how do you do? How do you do? [chuckling] Miss Yi, Master So is the richest man here. He's so good looking. [chuckles] And very intelligent too! Girls flock to meet him -like bees to honey. -You mean this man? Yes, of course-- Oh, no! [chuckles] It was so when I was 20 years younger. It's my son, So Chai. My son needs a strong woman, and you're educated overseas, so I'm sure you'd qualify for-- [men shouting] [man] watch what you're doing there, huh? [shouting continues] Your father's fooling around with another woman! I saw him myself! -Hey! -Hey! Whoa! [crowd chattering] [banging] -Your trousers! -[all] Huh? -[all murmuring] -See? That's my son. Doesn't he look like me, huh? -That's your son? -That's him! [chuckles] -I'm a missionary! -You should go! -God bless you. -Never mind that. Go on! Go, go! Quickly! Go on! [all murmuring] Hey, let's take a picture. Come on. -Huh? -Okay. Put your trousers on! You have parents! Oh! Oh! -Oh! Oh! Oh! -Hey! Hey! I've got mine on! -[Jean] Where's your Dad? -Come on. Let's go. -Hey, hey, hey! Be careful! -Over there. -Ohh! -Are you all right? -Are you okay? [laughing] -I'm all right. -I'm sorry. -You ruined my teeth! [groans] [chuckling nervously] I tell you, he's with another woman. [chuckling] See what a nice boy he is. And he loves playing balls. Bye-bye! Bye-bye! [laughing] Hey, I used to play balls as well. Maybe someday we can play together, huh? We-- We play balls? [whimpering] Better than music! Oh, listen, my son's mother, I got lucky today, you know. I met this pretty thing. Oh, she's really beautiful! -Is she prettier than me? Huh? -Oh, no! -[yells] -No, I don't mean that! -[groaning] -You lied? No, you're the prettiest! No one's prettier than you! Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What have you been doing today? Nothing. I just went to see about the marriage. -What's that? -Oh, no, no, no! You're an unfaithful bastard! My sister would kill you if she saw you now! [yelling] Come on! She's been dead for 20 years! -Don't talk back! -Hey! Can you keep quiet, Father? Now, Auntie, do it for me. Forgive him. No more girls, huh? Are you chasing girls? Oh, come on, son! Look, really. I'm not doing anything! -You heard him. -Okay, you go. Okay. Hey, son, son! Hey, you'll like the girl I-- [yelling] Oh, no! No, no, no! No, please! Oh, no! Let me go! You old fool! Don't you contaminate your son! You old lecher! You dirty old man! Scumbag! Garbage! Rat face! Good for nothing! Are you slime? -You really piss me off! -[groaning] Don't you know I always loved you? Huh? What's that, Jean? What did you say just now? I mean the last thing you said. I didn't catch it. Son! Son, lock him in the barn and don't feed him today! Hey, come on! That's not what you said last time! Come on, what was it, huh? -Sorry, sir. I've gotta do it. -I'm not sure I can walk. [groans] [door opens] [sighs] Hey! Hi, Dad. This place is not bad. If you like it that much, we'll swap places, huh? -I'm no lecher. -Neither am I. I did it for you. Oh, yes, I see. You come visiting me, and you don't bring me a damn thing. I can get girls too now, Dad, thank you. -Here, a little something for you. -What's that? -Ohh! -[laughing] Enjoy it. Oh, you do care about me after all. [chuckles] Hey, I've got wine, but I've got no food to go with it. -It's gonna be a long night. -Mmm, stop pretending, Dad. Let's see it. Huh? -What? -Well, what is it? [groans] -Wow! Look at all that! -Shh! -What's this? -Lower your voice! Oh, it's better than what I get out there! Shh. Not so loud. Your aunt will kill me. -I know. -Then stop shouting. The whole goddamn house will hear you. Okay, come on. Let's attack this. [giggles] Right. For me? Ahh-- Hey, hey, hey! Of course, for you first. [laughing] You like to fool around, don't you? -Huh? You bad son. -Like father, like son. -You can have that. Aah, enjoy! -[laughing] Enjoy. -Mm-mmm. -Ohh! -This is great, Dad. -Yeah! [laughing] -Have a drink. -Yeah, you too, Dad. [laughing] I'm too late. [So Chai] Hey, the chicken is fresher than that girl today. [Kwan] Yeah, she studied abroad, -you know. -Oh, so that's why. [sighs] I'm not on heat or anything, but I'm attracted to his naivety. He's kind, I suppose. He's not a wife-batterer. He's square, but at the same time seductive. That mustache of his is driving me nuts. Well, after all, I'm your sister. Can you tell me how I can get him interested in me? How can I turn him on like a light? Huh? Huh? Hmm. You'd better not say anything. I'll figure it out. Huh! More tea over here. Okay, coming. [humming a melody] -You've got balls, boy! -Whoa! -You're really something, madam. -Ahh. So, you can see through me. My name is Kwan. If you're sick, you can come to me. You've got a smart mouth, boy. What's that? -Name a price. -Price? -How much do you charge? -Oh, you mean to buy my herbs? No, you! Hey, madam, are you trying to seduce me? -Are you a virgin? -[yells] [groans] -Oh, it'll cost you a lot. -Is this enough? I'm not for sale. -But as you're so keen... -[moans] Well, it shouldn't take long. Oh, it will, my dear. [Chinese themed music] Hurry up. Time is not on my side. Well, maybe next time. There won't be a next time. -This is my first time. -You silly boy. An hour is all you need. It won't take long. Come on. Sing for me. Sing for me! [music continues] [music continues] [sighs] -Hey! -[chuckles] Oh, you know something? You two look good together. Hey, my sister-in-law is the most attractive in the village, especially her teeth. [chuckles] You're a lucky man. Hey, Jean, I'm so happy for you that you finally found a man. Hey, when are you gonna get married? How about today? Wait! My one hour is up! Can I go now? You wanna find a husband, find someone else. Hey, you get engaged first! He doesn't know what he's missing. Hey, wait! [chuckles] You garbage! I'm with another man, and you don't even seem surprised! [wails] You can't blame me. What should I do, cry? Huh! -[crowd shouting] -The women's association! Where's my wife, huh? [shouting continues] We've come here to get our wives back. You can't go in there. They're having a class. What? A glass of what? Oh, dear! They're trying to drug our women! -Come on! Let's go in! -[shouting continues] -[speaks Chinese] -[class repeats in Chinese] -Man. -[class repeats] Man. [speaks Chinese] Woman. [crowd shouting] What are you doing here? Come home right now! [man] Come along! Come home! -[screaming] -[shouting continues] Stop! I'm just teaching them to read! -Stop it! -She's the one who started this! -Get her! -[gasps] [intense music] [groaning, wailing] Kiki! Twelfth Uncle. These people are barbaric. What are you doing in a place like this? You must remember you're a princess, Kiki. The reason for this club, and the printing press, is to educate women in China. -Do you think that's wrong too? -I don't. But people here don't appreciate it. You're just wasting your time I think. You'd better return to Peking. You watched me grow up. You know I don't give up that easily. I will persist with this. Now, listen, carefully. I want you to stop this women's club and printing pamphlets because I want you to stop the silly anti-opium campaign, alright? [Kiki sighs] Right now our country is very weak, as you know, and the foreigners are using this to force us to import opium. And we can't say no to them. If they wage war on us, we'll lose more. But, Uncle, you know the opium-- Look, you should do something more useful to help the country. Here. I want you to print this for me at once. "Official opium is better?" -But, Uncle-- -Hey. Now the treasury is short of money. We can levy a big duty on opium. This could make China strong again. Now, here's some money. This is just a deposit for your work. I will rely on you. [Jean] Who is Miss Yi? Come out! -[grunting] -Hey! What do you want? Back off! Come out, you home-wrecker! [sighs] Just what do you want with me? So you're that man-eater, heart-stealer! I thought you were a lady, but you're not pretty! -Who are you? What do you want? -Don't you know? -I'm the boss of the So family. -Oh, you're his wife. His wife died long ago, but I'm his beloved woman. What are you staring at? Are you jealous now? Can't you tell I'm not interested in him at all? My goodness! You filthy bitch! So you just toss a man away like that? You need a bonk on the head to wake you up! [grunting, gasping] -Oh, you stupid! -You bi-- [shrieks] What are you doing, Auntie? What? She's your auntie? Yeah. It's all a misunderstanding. How dare you take her side? I'm your aunt! No, Auntie. She's young and rich. She's not interested in my Father. Rubbish! I saw them hugging each other myself! Dad's not interested in young, inexperienced girls. He's not that blind, Auntie. I broke that camera. [chuckles] You should apologize. -Mm... -I'm sorry. Leave it. It's a misunderstanding. Our family's all nervous wrecks. Hey! Are you saying that's my weakness? No, being rash is not a weak point, it's a strong point. I was rather rash with your Father last night! You mean, you and he-- [whines] I've ruined his life! -[sighs] -Oh, I'm so sorry! [sobbing] I should have believed what he said! Why didn't he explain everything to me? [continues sobbing] I must go and talk to him. Wait a minute. You can't go like that. I'm sorry. I'll pay for the camera. [laughs] -[whimpering] -Hey, Auntie! What about me? [chuckles] She's just a bit nuts. -Oh, so, Brother So-- -Your Highness. -You and Kiki. -What a surprise to see you. -Very good. -I don't know him. Oh, my father has arranged everything. I'm very happy with her. I think she's just a bit shy. Well, we'll soon be family. You can come visit my place. Thank you. I'm ready. -Shall we go now? [chuckling] -Hey-- [gasps] Huh! Hmm! Hey, would you like a puff, hmm? I don't smoke. [chuckles] -You should try it. -No, thanks. [chuckles] Hey, if you think you're gonna get hooked, then just look at me. I smoke it three times a day, and I'm not hooked. Instead, I feel great. It's all in the mind, you know. I'm not worried about that. But no. A man must try everything. So, come on. No, I'm not interested. Hey, you're not scared, are you? Come on, Your Highness. You want to test me on a small thing like that? I don't blame you. Even Wong Fei Hong doesn't have the guts to try it. Well, Wong Fei Hong is scared, but it doesn't mean I am too. Okay, I'll try it, Your Highness. That's more like it. [mysterious music] [coughing] How do you feel? Fine. Just fine. [chuckles] People say... ...that opium must be banned. Wong Fei Hong has even opened up a stop-smoking class. He doesn't know anything. Come, have another pipe. Come on. All right. [chuckling] Come along, come along! This is your chance of a lifetime! Come along! Five days in the stop-smoking class, you'll get 15 coppers from us. Hurry up and enroll. 15 coppers from the clinic. So put your name down for the stop-smoking class. -Excuse me, madam. -What is it? -Would you like to earn some extra money? -I'm not into that. You're not an addict, but maybe your man is. You know, men are easily seduced. They fall deep, and they lose their body and soul to the opium. Would you give your body to seduction? [chuckles] Not to you. Huh! No, please! You must stop smoking! No, I, I, I won't do it! I'd rather take the anti-opium pills! -[man yells] -Hey, those pills are no use. All right, I'll give you 20 coppers. Huh? Okay? -Now go back to class. -No, I won't go back in there! -No more smoking! No! Come on! -[yelling] No! Hey, hold it! Let him go. It's you again. What do you want? Making more trouble? I know what you're doing. All this is to make a name for your clinic. -He doesn't want it. Let him go. -You can go to hell. -[grunting] -[groaning] [yells] [loud bang] [groaning] -No! Please, no! -[men groaning] -[man] Come on! -Please let me out! -[groaning continues] -You're trying to kill them! [water splashes] [yelling] You wanna fight? Come on then! [gasps] Teacher, it's So Chai. He's making trouble. Master Wong, what are you doing? -A Chinese sauna? -You're wrong. That steam bath will help them to clear out their poisoned systems of the toxins. Have you smoked it? Well, I have. You know, a man of strong will does not get hooked. These people will smoke again once they're out. -This is useless. -Who do you think you are? -Why don't you-- -Kwan! If they don't kick the habit, there's no future for them, Chai. It's a good thing to try and help, but then you must consider the consequences. Otherwise, you'll do more harm than good. But what you're doing to them is no use, and the consequences of your action is to lose your clinic. Chai, please don't push me too far. -We're busy. Have a good day. -Get out! Right. I'll go when they go. You won't go? Then I'll make you go. -[loud banging] -[grunting] [energetic music] [banging, grunting continues] [loud bangs] [man] The commissioner has arrived! [music fades] [indistinct chatter] Master Wong, is there some trouble here? Not at all, Your Honor. I was just practicing kung fu with So Chai. My respects, Your Honor. It was just an exercise. Well, thank you, Brother Kwan, for holding my boots. Who's holding whose boots? Your Honor, if you'll excuse me. -Forget it, Kwan. -He's a very good fighter. It's sad. He's still so naive. [people shouting, chattering] Support the campaign! Sign up for our campaign! Hey, what are you doing? I've done nothing wrong! What's wrong with you! -Fingerprints, okay? -Ah, you're crazy! -Thank you, sir. -Hey, hey, hey. What's this all about? For the anti-opium campaign. Just sign this. I have nothing to do with this. Good-bye. It'll only take a minute, sir. Oh, please, sir, come on back. Please. Hey, hey! What are you doing? -Come on, please. -Sign what? What are you talking about? I just want you to sign something. Come on, please. Hey! Oh, look what you've done to my thumb. It's all dirty now. Damn women troublemakers. Ai-yaah. [woman] Sign your name up here! What you're doing is no use. You're wasting your time. This is not a question of opium. It's a question of will. [sighs] You make it sound so simple. It's not a question of strong will. Otherwise, Master Wong wouldn't have to open -a stop-smoking class. -Look, if I weren't your fiancé, I wouldn't waste time with you now. If I didn't care about you, I wouldn't even bother to tell you what I think about this. Okay? Look, a decent girl with a proper upbringing wouldn't go shouting in the street. It's embarrassing for me. You're not my fiancé. I went to that meeting with your Father to collect information for my research. I'm a princess. You think I'd fancy you? I wouldn't accept any arranged marriage with a man like you. I'm not so ugly that I need a matchmaker -to help me out, you know? -Are you saying I'm ugly? I thought you liked me. Well, that's none of my business. So good-bye, thickhead! Ho-- How could you? You insulted me! Yeah, that's right! I'm a man. I can't argue. Try it, and you'll lose! Hmm! Sign your name! Join our campaign! [gentle music] Damned peasant. He's too much. -[cup rattles] -[Kiki gasps] What's that? She said you're thick? [whimpers] Now, that sounds to me as if she's trying to openly seduce you. So why don't you just follow it through and jump at this opportunity. Then you'll have her and her money. -Hey! -[groans] Now, after all, she is a member of the royal family. Hmm... So, if you can marry this girl, you could be made a minister or something. Then the So family will not only be rich, but famous too. Right. I tell you what. I now order you, as your aunt, to go to her and apologize profusely. Hey! What are you doing? Wake up! Huh? What's that? Huh? Hmm? -Take that camera and apologize. -[groans] [blows] You know, we need your help a great deal. You can earn a lot from this trade. While I'm here everything should be okay. I promise, there's no problem. -Just you make sure it is okay. -Sure. Thank you. -Good-bye. -Thank you. Good-bye. -[Prince] See the guests out. -[man] Sir. [suspenseful instrumental music] [whispering] Uncle. You can count on me, gentlemen. No one will ever guess that the opium is stored in my house. Open that box. -This is fine. -All right. Opium! [gasps] [music continues] [yells] [panting] [gates open, close] No one's following me. I should be safe now. -[creaking] -[gasps] [gasps] [creaking] [tables banging] [gasping, whimpering] [continues whimpering] [panting] [sighs] [yells] [loud banging] [firing] [dramatic music] [chair clatters] -[explosions] -[gasping] [panting] [yelling] It's not me! -It is me! -Huh? -I came to give you this camera. -Someone wants to kill me. [yells] [firing] Get down! Watch out! [shouts] [bang] -Help me! -Go now! [gasping] [loud banging] [banging continues] -Hyah! -[bangs] [dramatic music] [bangs] [grunting] Hyah! [gates banging] [sword clashing] [both] Hyah! Huh? [groans] [explosion] [loud bang] Hyah! This beggar is still useful. We won't kill him yet. [whimpers] Your Highness, what am I doing here? Uh, my men found you in an alleyway. You were wounded and unconscious. [groaning] What happened to me? I think the Fire Lotus attacked me. The Fire Lotus gang? Where's Kiki? She was with me. -I haven't seen her. -Oh. But don't worry. I'm sure she's okay. [groans] It hurts? Have a pipe. It'll take the pain away, you see. Go on. It's all right. [mysterious music] Now, how do you feel? Isn't that better? [clapping] He's now in a daze. You find Kiki. But don't hurt her. I don't want problems with my brother. When he's addicted, he can kill Lin. That's clever, my lord. Hmm. I see. You're looking for So Chai. My lord, do you know his whereabouts? Master Wong, I know So Chai, but I'm not his nanny. But, sir, Kiki said she saw you last night. You were both seen together. [chuckles] I was at Madam Chung's last night. I was there the whole time, but I never saw So Chai. Look, Uncle, I don't care what you do. I'm not interested. But I have to help So Chai. Kiki, you're too suspicious. Chai wouldn't go to a brothel. Besides, you're a Manchu princess. You can't marry a Han. And yet you've disregarded that law. You hang out with these peasants. -You're disgraceful! -That's not true! I'm sorry, sir. Maybe this is not a good time. Sorry to have disturbed you. We'll go now. Wait! You can't leave. Hmm. Wong Fei Hong, you can't just walk out. I'll lose face. I'm sure you understand. My lord, I'm just concerned about a friend's safety. Hmm? I'll tell you what. I heard that your kung fu is good. If you can beat me, then you're free to go. But if you lose, then you leave your head. [grunting, groaning] [grunting, groaning continue] [yelling] [grunting, groaning continues] -You're good. -Huh? Hee-yaah! My lord! Lin Ze Xu pays his respects. Save it! See him out! Your Honor. Local officials complain that you've totally disrupted life here. The foreign minister thinks you're ruthless with foreign traders. So what do you have to say, Master Lin? This could cost you dearly. My lord, all I can say is, everything I'm doing is for the good of the country. I've vowed to destroy opium, no matter what it costs. Master Lin, you don't seem to have a grasp of the situation at all. Under the circumstances, maybe you should leave, retire early... ...and leave the serious business to us. I will never quit as long as opium exists. I'm not somebody who will give up halfway. Right. The policy's changed. Just to let you know, I've filed papers with His Majesty to impose heavy taxes on opium. So when people run out of money, then they will quit. Your Highness, that's not the answer to the problem. We have to ban opium imports, or China will become a nation of drug addicts. Hmm! I smoke too. What do you plan on doing about that? What I'm after, sir... ...are merchants who have large quantities. You're treading on thin ice. [laughing] Here's a word of advice for you: keep out of it. [mysterious music] Brother So. I found Kiki, but she spends all her time with Wong Fei Hong these days. Kiki is still very young. She is very naive. I'm afraid she'll be taken in by sweet talk. I regret I didn't believe you. This Wong Fei Hong... ...is a real hypocrite, as you say. Now he's using Lin and the opium ban to blackmail me. He and the commissioner are demanding a lot of money from me. They've even ganged up with local bandits who give them support openly. Sooner or later, these gangsters will ruin the country. [So Chai] Wong Fei Hong. Lin Ze Xu. [music continues] [Wong] First we must cut off their head. [chuckles] You're a very good chess player as well. I admit my defeat. -[loud bang] -[yelling] -Call the guards! -[yells] [banging, grunting] Hyah! [glass breaks] [groaning] -Chai! -You okay, sir? I'm okay. -You can all leave now. -[men] Sir! He seems heavily addicted. [Wong] Chai was just being used. Master Lin won't blame him. Master Wong, how's my son? Listen. You mustn't blame your son. He's heavily addicted to opium. Then what shall I do? I think you better move all the furniture away. In the meantime, I'll go to Korea House and try to get a ginseng to make a tonic for him. -See you later. -Oh, thank you so much. Thank you, sir. [sighs] Hey! Don't just stand there like lumps! Didn't you hear what he said? Move the furniture! [hammer blows] [groaning] Father! Let me out! Let me out! I need opium! I need a smoke! Father, let me out! I need opium! Let me out! I need a smoke! Father! [groans] Let me out! Son, just hang in there. -I need opium! Let me out! -I can't. Don't worry. Master Wong will help you. Wow! This is a magnificent place. [together] Please take a seat. -Thank you. -[chuckles] Oh, it's a real pleasure to meet you, Master Wong. -Please sit down, won't you? -Please. -Oh, this looks good. -Mr. Kim. I've come here, good sir, to ask you to sell me your 1,000-year-old ginseng to help a friend. Huh! I've heard that opium is a health drug. It brings people longevity. My ginseng has no value in comparison. You must be joking, Mr. Kim. Opium is poisoning all China. Your ginseng can save thousands of lives, so please help us out. Have you eaten yet, Mr. Wong? If not, then please join us, would you? I thought maybe that you'd like a taste of this ginseng. Hmm! [grunting] Wow! [glass breaks] Oh. Uh, we can cut it up. Can we have a knife or something? Huh! If you can't even solve that little problem, you don't deserve it. You're obviously trying to test us, is that it? You-- Kwan! Just be quiet. Stand back! Mr. Kim, I apologize for him. Mr. Kim, let's drink to your health. [punches] [grunting, groaning] [glass breaks] [music continues] The ginseng is still raw and hard. It needs some cooking to soften it. [music continues] [banging, grunting] [banging, grunting continues] -Have you heard of Taekwondo? -Wait. [banging, grunting continues] [music continues] [glass breaks] -[loud bang] -[groans] [glass breaks] -Oh! -Careful! [bang] Mr. Kim, thank you. You're good. Your tiger and crane fist, sir, is really as good as people say. I'm very honored to have met an unselfish man like you. I'm sure my ginseng will be put to good use. Thank you very much, sir. Do you know, wife... ...since I married into your family... ...my only contribution is our son. I feel so useless. I've remained a widower for almost 20 years. Yes, everything I've done is for Chai. I used to think that I could depend on him in my old age, and now he's become a drug addict. It hurts me so much to see him suffer, trying to quit, and it's all my fault. I spoiled him rotten. It's nothing to do with the Sos. I'm responsible. If there is blame, then it's with me! -Uh, Master Wong-- -Get away! Leave me alone! Oh, please don't make it hard for him! Get out of my way now! [chattering] -Chai? Chai? -Missus? Uh, Missus? Young master's gone out. What's wrong with you people? I told you to watch him! -He beats us up. What can we do? -You're useless! -What's up? Huh? -Young master's gone out. Hey you! Don't stand there looking like an idiot! Go out and find him, and don't you come back until you have! Oh, I understand. You want your son to go away, hopefully die of drug addiction. And then you could get married again. You don't care about your son at all! [gasps] How dare you say that! For many years I've endured your nonsense, your abuse, your denigration, and I've said nothing so far because of Chai! I would've left here long ago if it wasn't for him! -You silly old fart! -Shut up! [slap] [moaning] Huh? My God! Are you okay? Hmm! Young man. [whimsical music] Huh? Hmm! Huh? Come on! Hit me again! I love it! Come on! Hit me! Oh, God, Jean! What's come over you, huh? What? Hey, where's your teeth? What's happened to your teeth? What's wrong? Don't you like my teeth? Oh, yeah, yeah. I'd better go and find our son though. Mr. So, where is your son? Well, that's exactly what I'd like to know too. No! Hey, maybe he's gone -to his Godfather's. -Yeah, of course. [giggles] Hey, wait, Kiki! Wait! Wait a minute! Oh, God. I was gonna ask her to help us. Hey, don't just stand there! Let's find Chai! -I'm coming! Oh, I love you so! -[groans] -Oh, my God. She's on something. -Let's go. [shuddering] -Let's go home. -No! Only two more days and you'll kick it. You mustn't give up now. Come on. Go away! Just leave me alone, Wong Fei Hong. I thank you for your help... ...but you're wasting your time. Just leave me to die. You're a talented man, but you're too full of yourself. -Come with me! Come on! -No! I won't! [groans] You said you had strong will, so show me now. Where's it all gone? You refuse to tell us who sent you to kill the commissioner. You think that's loyalty? Get up! [groaning] Come on. Fight back. Get up! You hate me, don't you? Come on! So you have no strength. I'll help you out. [coins jingling] That's for the opium. Find me afterwards. Your dad's a disgrace, and he married into the Sos for their money. Now his son is even worse than him, a coward! You're a total disgrace. You can insult me, but you can't insult my father! [gentle music] So Chai, you're finally holding your head up. Father, please tell me, what am I going to do? Have a drink. You're now heavily addicted. You need to get drunk. You're clever. Being cleverer is hard. It's hard to be stupid, but harder to become stupid when you start out clever! -So drink. -I don't understand what you're saying. -It's all too difficult for me. -You'll understand when you're drunk! You'll forget all about opium when you're drunk. Drink! Come on! [gulping] -More! -No! I can't! -I don't drink. -You can. Go on! Drink! [all chanting] Drink, drink, drink, drink! Drink, drink, drink, drink! -Drink, drink, drink, drink! -You must drink it. -Drink, drink, drink, drink! -Drink! Go on! [chanting continues] Drink it down! Go on! Drink more. Drink! Drink. I'll show you the drunken style! Drink, drink, drink, drink! Drink, drink, drink, drink! Drink, drink, drink, drink! [glass breaks] Drink, drink, drink, drink! Drink, drink, drink, drink! Drink, drink, drink, drink! Drink, drink, drink, drink! Drink, drink, drink, drink! Drink, drink, drink, drink! You're getting tipsy. That's when a drunken fist takes form. Your head may be fuzzy, but neither your mind nor your fists. Attack your opponent when his guard's down. Surprise is the essence of good martial arts. Drink, drink, drink, drink! Drink, drink, drink, drink! Hee-yaah! [loud banging] [men grunting, groaning] [banging] [groans] [banging continues] Go on! Let's go! You want trouble? [sword clashing] [dramatic music] [man] Protect the women and children! [sword clashing] Haah! [woman] Give up, So Chai. We'll spare your life. [shouting] [grunting, groaning continues] [banging continues] -Don't go! -Godfather! Come on! Let's go! Don't worry. -[slashing] -[groaning] [groaning continues] -No! -Father! No, Father! Let's get out of here! You go! [swords clashing] [grunting, shouting] -Father! -No! -[groans] -Let's go! [groaning] [slashing] [woman] Damn! That So Chai got away. [grunts] [panting] -I'll get you some water. -Don't go. [dramatic music] Don't leave me, please. Please, don't leave me. No. Please, don't go. [groans] [gasps] Chai! Chai! -I think it's better we both split up. -Oh, yeah. [soft music] [music continues] Why won't you go home and see your family? You kicked the habit. You can go back to a normal life now. The So Chai I know is a man who risked his own life to help me. So, listen, Chai, if you do care about me... ...stop hurting, all right? You should go to the prince and avenge your Godfather! You've drunk enough! Wake up! Where's your willpower? Where's your confidence? Master Wong needs your help. Help him. I know. You're selfish. You're scared. Coward! You've no guts. You're scared. I'm right, aren't I? Look at me! How can I fight? My hands are shaky and my legs are-- are scared to meet my father or Master Wong. I'm too ashamed to face anyone. [gasping] I'm not ashamed of you no matter what happens. All right. I'll see Master Wong. The prince's plot to kill me has failed, but he'll come up with something else very soon. We must move fast. Time is running out. -[sighs] -Your Honor, is something bothering you? Well, I obtained information long ago. The prince is in league with the opium merchants. I was going to file a report with the emperor, but the prince must've got wind of that. [man] Hear ye the edict. The son of heaven, His Majesty, decrees that the special commissioner, Lin Ze Xu, abused his authority and disrupted law and order. He is suspended. He will return to the capital for an inquiry. Hear and obey. [dramatic music] [chuckles] Lin Ze Xu, aren't you going to obey the edict and remove your official headgear? You won't do it? Huh? [chuckling] Nobody goes up against me and then wins. [laughing maniacally] Sir... -Master Wong... -Yes. ...I don't care what happens to me personally. We must go through with our plan. Yes, Your Honor. I shall do everything I can to stop this evil man. Hmm. -Master Wong! -You can't come in. -Master Wong! -You can't, I told you. Please, please! Teacher, he insists on seeing you. -What does he want? -I don't know! Master Wong, my teacher's the Beggar Clan chief. He's dead. -Please help us to avenge him! -Hey, get up. Now tell me what happened. My men have discovered where the prince is hiding his opium. Only you can help us, Master Wong. We want to destroy him to avenge our chief. Right. It'll be my pleasure. Kwan, inform the commissioner at once. Hmm. -Over here! -Easy! -Move it! Come on! -Move it, move it! [light dramatic music] Next! Come on. That's a lot of opium you got here, Your Highness. You're gonna make a fortune from this shipment. [chuckles] So will you. [chuckles] To the success of our joint venture. -Huh? [chuckles] Cheers. -[rapid footsteps] [all shouting] [banging, swords clashing] [swords clashing] Wong Fei Hong? Your Highness, I caught you red-handed. You can't deny this anymore. A dead man cannot talk. -You won't get me into a court. -[glass smashes] -Kill him! -[loud bangs] You go, sir. -[firing] -[man yelling] [gunfire] [banging, shouting continues] [banging, groaning continues] [gates crash] [banging, grunting continues] [loud banging] [men grunting] [loud bang] [banging, shouting continues] [loud banging] [banging, grunting] [loud bang] [men shouting] [banging, grunting] -Why did you use me? -You're stupid. -That's why, you fool. -I'm gonna kill you. Just try it! [shouts] [man groaning] [yells] [banging, shouting continues] [sword clashing, banging] [banging, shouting continues] [sword clashing] [sword clashing] [exploding] [sword clashing] [banging] [grunts] [shouting] [jug crushes] [shouting] [loud bangs] [stairs crushing] [shouting] [banging] [groans] [grunting] [jugs crashing] Huh! We were friends once. I'll let you drink before you die. Drink! [laughs] Go on! [groaning] Drink it! [laughs] Drink it! Drink! Your head may be fuzzy, but your mind is not. That's all the essence of martial arts. Get drunk! Then you'll understand. Huh? [grunting] [banging] [banging, grunting continues] [banging, grunting continues] [stairs crushing] [pained groaning] [both yelling] -Thanks a lot. -Not at all. [blow lands] [yells, groans] -[grunting] -I'll kill him! I mean it! So Chai, you won't get me so easy. [spits] I am the king's brother. There's no way you can get me. [laughing] Let's go! Back off! Go on! Don't come near me! You dogs. You wanna kill me? Never! The opium's mine! -Don't touch it! You hear me? -Never mind me. Burn it! Shut up! I'll kill ya! Don't touch my opium! Huh! Come on! Let's go! Move, move! [firing] [groaning] [yelling] -[groans] -Chai, are you all right? I'm fine. You saved my life again. Now I'll return it. Hmm. [all cheering] [uplifting music] I never thought that I could accomplish my mission before I returned. Our hard work has paid off. -All right! Burn the opium! -Burn it! [cheering continues] [all] Burn the opium! Burn the opium! Strengthen China! Burn the opium! Strengthen China! The strength of this triumph could burn through our future generations. [music continues] [music continues]
