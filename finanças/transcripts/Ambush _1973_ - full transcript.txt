You played dead to avoid being suspected l didn't realise this until that night Chian Niang thought that l was in sound sleep and got up to meet you not knowing that l was watching her This dagger of yours inspired me to use someone else to be the fall guy So l killed Old Wang and let him pose as me You were to take the blame but l didn't expect you'd still be alive today As regards the cousin seeing ghosts in the cave l already suspected that it was you behind this To tell you the truth Tu Ba and l have been close by you all the time When l knew that you wanted to open up the coffin l had no choice but to play dead Now you know the truth, and can rest in peace You are after all a coward l am not Only l must avenge my father What?
