Ganeshana Maduve[Ganesha's wedding] Anantnag Vinaya Prasad [Board reads- Journalists] I have a question for the producers. You have named the movie- Ganesha's Wedding. Is Ganesha[meaning Lord Ganesha] married? Can you please tell us what is the story? We are only the producers of this film. We know only how to finance and make a movie. We don't know how to tell a story. If you want to hear the story, hear from the story writer. Who's the story writer? Story: Raja Chendur [Translation] Origin: Malladi Krishnamurti Malladi Krishnamurti has written this story in Telugu. I have translated it to Kannada. I can tell you the story. It won't be interesting to hear it from me. Only if hear it with all the dramatic and musical effects will it be most effective. Who has written the dialogues for this? Dialogues: Ku. Nagabhushan Being a dialogue writer, I can tell you the story with all the dramatic effects. But supporting all that... musical effects, sound and songs... must be there to support it. Only then will you enjoy it. That is possible only by a director. Who is the director? They all say that only you can tell the story effectively. Please tell the story. It is a lie that only I can tell the story effectively. Only when these people join hands with me... ...can I tell the story effectively. Look inside. So many people have cooperated with you Phaniramachandra. Now tell us the story. Sure. In Bangalore city, Just a bit down from Bugle Rock, On Rangarao street, Is a housing complex. Ramanamurti is its owner, Kanakalakshmi, his life partner, Adilakshmi is their daughter, This is their family. Ganesha, the troublemaker, Shastri, his loyal sidekick, Shatabisha, Abhilasha are... the prominent tenants. Only one meter for all the houses, A single tap to fetch the water, This is the centre for all the quarrels, This is the big problem here. Our owner is purebred loafer, Dirty minded vulgar swine, A miser who's only after money, Is how everyone curses the owner. Ghosts who haunt my houses, Unwanted apparitions in our life, Devils who trouble us, And this is how the owner and tenants curse each other. A place where such varied people live, Where colourful stories happen, I'll tell one story of love that... ...happens here. This owner is one tasteless fellow. He spoils all my sweet dreams by playing this Nadaswara music. I must set him right by telling Ganesha. This owner be damned. One gets into proper sleep at 4 A.M. He spoils that too. Can't you go say something to him? Suppose I can. What if he gets angry just by that? Or throw us out of the house? And throw our things out of the house? Quit your babbling. Ganesha is the right man for these things. What has gotten into the owner? When the whole country is sleeping peacefully... ...he puts his radio on loudly. What to do? Ganesha is the right man. Oh, you too are here to stir Ganesha up? Yes. Hasn't Ganesha woken yet? He won't wake up even if the volume is ten times high. That's why Shastri is trying to wake him up. Ganesha! Ganesha wake up. Did Ganesha wake up? No. I couldn't. Shall I try? No. Shankar, you come. Hold that side. Earthquake! Earthquake! It's not earthquake. It's apocalypse outside. That owner has woken up early and put his radio on loudspeakers. All the tenants have come here complaining about it, you know? What shall I do? You have to bawl that tyrant out... ...and make that deafening noise stop. I won't do it. You do it. It's not that I can't do it. But there should be only one guy who takes the bad name. You are already known as quarrelsome, troublemaker, rude man. Only when one gets a good name and the other, bad can you win in this world. Even after all that, the only man who can stand up to Ramanamurti is... ...you, Ganesha. In this whole vatara[housing complex]... ...you are the only real man, Ganesha. Go our hero, go. Go quarrel with him. Crushing the arrogance of that tyrant Ramanamurti... ...go stop that noise. Go our hero, go. Ramanamurti! Ramanamurti! Mister, why are you yelling? There's no deaf here. If not deaf, why would you put the radio on loudspeaker? I didn't play it so loudly because we're deaf. I did that because you are all lazy. We are lazy? Are you not? You people sleep even if it's 8 O' clock. You see... Nobody should be lying down at sunrise. This is this vatara's condition. It's auspicious to play such music in the morning. If you can agree to that, stay... or else empty your houses and leave. We will. As soon as we find another house, we will. Who will stay in this sty tolerating your antics? Mister! I won't sit quietly while you call my house a sty. Don't keep quiet. Hold that in your hand and come dance Bharatanaatya here everyday. Yes! But I won't stand this loudspeaker nonsense every morning. What will you do if I put it on? I'll barge into your house and take those radio and loudspeakers and throw them into the well. Do you think it's your father-in-law's house to barge in? Father-in-law's house? What sin have I committed to deserve this man as my father-in-law? My father too hasn't done anything evil to deserve you as his son-in-law. No. He is lucky to have me as his son-in-law. Because I am like Lord Rama. That's why this fellow looks like Ravana. And she? She looks like Shoorpanakhi. Mrs. Kanaka! Oh dear lord! What happened? Bring a glass of cold buttermilk. I don't how many will die here today because of my rage. Ganesha! What is it? You started a fight this early in the morning? Iâ€™ve told you so many times. One shouldn't quarrel with the house owner... or go in front of a raging bull... or throw stones at a rabid dog. You just won't listen to me. Sorry, Ramanamurti. Sorry, Adilakshmi. On behalf of my roommate... I apologise to you. Why do you apologise to them? Just because we're paying rent to stay in this sty... ...can he blare those loudspeakers early in the morning? Oh, you mean you have problem with speakers blaring? Then? You're raising such a big fuss over this little matter? What do you think our Ramanamurti is? His heart... is bigger than Mount Everest. His heart... is bigger than Atlantic ocean. Totally, everything is big in him. You lovely rascal. You're the only person who knows me well. Did you hear that Ganesha? Now do you understand what sort of a person he is? One must peacefully go to him... ...and tell him, "What Mr. Ramanamurti?" "If you put radio on this loud early in the morning..." "...we can't sleep well." Is he a jackass to not understand this? Or a cow? Or a ghost? Or an apparition? Am I not right Mr. Ramanamurti? Yes, we both aren't all of those things. Everybody listen. From tomorrow onwards, there won't be any loudspeakers playing. This I guarantee on his behalf. Is it alright? Is it okay? Let's go then. Mr. Shastri. I have a doubt. What if he agrees now and puts the radio on tomorrow anyway? What if the fight starts again? Or throw us out of the house? You just move. I'm the only man in this vatara. I mean you. After quarreling with this Ramanamurti... I'm bored. Let's listen to the radio. Schedule of programmes to be aired today. 6:40 - Advice to farmers Bull crap. 7:00 - News Who understands that? 7:10 - Regional news All about some minister dying somewhere. 8:20 - Songs sung by Ms. Shruti Songs sung by Ms. Shruti at 8:20. Shastri. Today I'm blessed. I thought my mood would be spoiled whole by that Ramanamurti. But there'll be songs by Ms. Shruti at 8:20. I would be delighted to listen to her. We've to tape it. It's 6:20. There's still two hours. Hey, what are you doing? I'll make it 8:20. Hey crazy! Just by changing this clock, can you change the time of the world? Or will Shruti start singing there? If you keep turning it like that, you'll ruin my clock. If you can't pass time, go take bath 3-4 times. It'll be office time by then. No, no. I won't get the mood till I hear her voice. I can get ready in 3 minutes while I listen to her songs. Wake me up at 8:20. I'll be lying down like this till then. Some nutcase. Ganesha, it's 8:20, wake up. Now, Ms. Shruti's songs. Your madness is out of bounds. Until now you refused to get married. Now you're after some Shruti. You're acting crazy just by hearing her voice. What if she's ugly? Let her have warts on her face... or even a burnt face. Or have all her bones sticking out. She's my wife. What if she's married already? What can one do? Her memory will be my wife. But even in this age, to make me take interest in a woman, ...she must be one of a kind. You don't know her address or anything. That's why I've written 25 letters, one everyday, to the radio addressing her. Will she always be in the radio? She comes only when there is recording. How would she get your letters? I'll write one or two more and then go straight to the radio if I don't get an answer. Thank god. You won't sit at home waiting for her letter. I haven't given her this address. That Ramanamurti reads everyone's letters. I've given my office address instead. There are four people in the office called Ganesha. What if they read your letters? Impossible. Because I haven't written the letters in the name of Ganesha. Moreover, Ganesha is an old fashioned name. What if Shruti doesn't like it? That's why, I've shortened the name Y. Ganesha Rao to... a sweet... Y. G. Rao. Not bad. Even without buying me a beer for an idea, you've come up with an idea on your own. Your ideas are pretty costly. Only one idea for a beer. So, this time... Anyway, all the best. But you must buy me a beer once you get a reply from Shruti. Sure, I'll buy you two. I pray to god that your letters reach Shruti as soon as possible. Come Ms. Shruti. You've received 25 letters appreciating your singing from a single man. Who is it from? Y. G. Rao, United Insurance. He must be your ardent admirer. He's written to us asking for your address. We were waiting for your permission to give him that. Thank you, sir. Please don't give my address to anyone sir. Because... If my father comes to know about my singing in the radio, ...all hell will break loose in our house. That is why... ...I'm singing in the name of Shruti and not given out my real name even to your staff. You mean your real name is not Shruti? Then? Secret. Okay. Why does your father hate music so much? He doesn't hate music sir. He's angry with my elder sister. Because she used to sing very well, he encouraged her a lot. But she eloped with a orchestra singer. And so my father is worried that I might follow in her footsteps. Just because my mother continues to encourage me, I come and sing here secretly. I'll leave sir. You'll have to come for another recording soon. Okay sir. "To Shruti..." "I like your songs." "I like your voice even more." "I've listened to all your songs and taped them." "I keep listening to the often." "To the god who gave you this sweet voice," "and to your parents who named you Shruti, my humble gratitude." "Your admirer, Y. G. Rao, United Insurance." What Shruti? Does that letter make you forget the world around you? Yes. It's common for people who sing on TV and films to have fans. But to have a fan for someone like me who sings occasionally on radio, it's thrilling. Who wouldn't be your fan after hearing your voice? Sing on TV once and you'll have such letters flooding your house. I don't have that freedom for now. But if the man whom I wed has taste in music, it would be possible. Let's see. Tell me. Would you reply to your fan letters or not? Thankfully I don't have hundreds of them. But to this one who has taken the trouble to write so many letters... ...I won't write him back. Why? I'll go and meet him. Excuse me. Yes, please. -I wanted to meet Mr. Y. G. Rao. -It's the last room on that side. Thank you. Is Mr. Y. G. Rao Inside? He's inside. Please go in. Sir. Sir. Sir. Hello. What madam? He's not waking up at all. Poor fellow. He has trouble sleeping at his house. So, he comes to get some sleep here in the office. Wait, I'll come and wake him up. Sir. Sir. Sir. Some lady has come to meet you. Thoo! He looks so ugly. Why should it matter how a fan looks like? Namaskara, sir. Why are you standing there. Please come, sit down. Prakash! Don't stand there watching. Go and get two teas. I got your letters. Me? Letters? Very good. Your understood everything, right? Yes sir. How come... you like my voice so much? Voice? Yes, yes. Because you're a lady, right? Not just voice. I like everything in women. What a disgusting man. Is this man really my fan? By the by... When and where shall we meet? For what? Why else would we meet? If it's not possible outside, let's get it done here. What needs to be done? Don't worry. I'm United insurance. And my wife handles life insurance. Tell me your date of birth and I'll calculate the premium and let you know. This is insurance policy case. Alright sir. I'll leave. Kanaka. Are you done with all the house work? Yes, I'm done. OK then. His house be damned. Ramanamurti. Ramanamurti. Why are you yelling? What else must I do? I'm studying for departmental exams. If you remove the fuse before 10 PM, how can I study? I don't know all that. I can provide electricity only till 10 PM for the rent you pay me. If you want electricity all night, pay me 50 rupees extra each with your rent. Or pay me 1000 rupees upfront and I'll get a separate meter for you. Not everybody has money like you do. If you don't have money, buy candles. Or study under the street lamp. Have you heard of Sir Visvesraya? He studied under the street lamp. You too can become like him. If you keep asking money at every step, we'll write to rent control to teach you a lesson. Rent control! Kanaka. Mrs. Kanaka. What is it? What happened? What is it? Are you blackmailing my father? You'll write to rent control? Go write. Living in this house is as big an offence as to lease it without informing the authorities. Then they will throw you out as unauthorised occupation. I'm talking to Ramanamurti. You don't interfere. See, I'm his daughter. He's a heart patient. What if something happens to him? If you want to quarrel, quarrel with me. Oh Thataki![A demon] Who has the strength and will power to quarrel with you? You call me Thataki? Then? Can a woman with a big mouth be called Mother Sita? You're right. Don't know what ill fate awaits the man who marries her. That's my personal matter. I won't keep quiet if you you talk about that. Ganesha. What is all the yelling about? You create such a ruckus if I'm not at home for even two minutes. What's your problem now? If he removes the fuse before 10PM, how can I read? You're fighting for just that? Approaching him peacefully... Respectfully you must tell him... "See, Mr. Ramanamurti..." "It's a problem if you remove the fuse at night." Is he a monkey not to listen to you? Or a pig? Or a rabid dog? Am I right, Mr. Ramanamurti? -Tell him that. -Did you see? I'll guarantee on his behalf. Today onwards, he won't remove the fuse at night. He'll put the fuse back on right now. Go study whatever you like. We'll see. What Mr. Ramanamurti? Whatever you say. Except for the bad habit of drinking beer, you're a good man. If he doesn't remove the fuse from tomorrow, we can close the windows and door... ...and sleep with the fan on. My head hurts with all the fighting I did with Ramanamurti. Let's listen to Shruti's song. You're crazy for Shruti, aren't you? Aren't you crazy for free beer? It's like that. Yeah. Everybody's mad about something. Oh sixer! Oh four! Oh four! Oh sixer! Bhama, what is this? Kapil's sixer. Not that. What is this smell? Sixer. Walsh... ...bowled at short pitch. Kapil came out of the crease... ...and swung the bat like this. Like this! The ball went out of the field like this. Your damned sixer. There's something burning in the kitchen and she's on with the sixer His house be damned. He cut power off at this crucial moment. -Who are you cursing? -Who else? The power company who keeps cutting power off whenever they like. Stop your cursing. It's not the power company. I cut the power off. You? Why? Because I'm mad. Instead of feeding the husband who has come home tired... ...you're sitting here gawking at the TV. I don't know all that. Put the fuse back on first. There's only 5 overs left and still 45 runs to be made. I'm all tensed up. You put the fuse back on. If you don't serve me the lunch, I'll get all tensed up. Come serve me lunch. Then sit in front of the TV. Oh yeah? I haven't cooked anything today. Oh my god. Then what will I eat? Eat whatever you like. See... I've sacrificed so many test matches for you. I can't sacrifice this one day match too. You know how thrilling it is. I don't know how many runs my Kapil might have scored by now. You please put the fuse back on. No, I won't. Until you put something into my stomach, I won't put this back on. See, don't make it worse. I can't keep cooking for you all the time. There's your son in Bangalore. Get him married. And ask his wife to cook for you. She'll cook all you want. And I'll be rid of you. Marriage? That's impossible. The moment we named him Ganesha... ...he has decided to live a celibate like Lord Ganesha. So, you'll sit quiet? What use is your moustache then? Just wait. The girl we look for this time will the last. By hook or crook... ...I'll get him to marry her. Ganesha... No matter how much I try to suppress my love... ...I just can't. Not having enough courage to ask directly... ...or tell of my love... ...I'm suffering. If you show me the way... ...and make Ganesha fall in love with me, I'll offer 21 coconuts and... a garland of 21 sweets. -Is there a letter for Y. G. Rao? -Yes sir. Thank you. From Shruti. Shastri. I've got a letter from Shruti. Then you'll buy me a beer this evening? When I'm talking about letter, you are thinking only of beer. Some friend you are. "Mr. Y. G. Rao," "Do you have any common sense?" Read. "Have any shame?" "Just to make me buy some insurance," "you've written me letters posing as my fan." "I feel cheated for believing that you were a real admirer of music." "Don't write letters to anyone anymore just to improve your business." "Heartbroken,..." "Shruti." Something has gone wrong. It's gone completely wrong. Somebody who doesn't like you... ...must have written her and done mischief. Or knowing that you write her letters... ...they must've met her and asked to buy insurance. Ganesha. You write her a detailed letter explaining things. Praise her excessively. There's no woman in the world who doesn't fall for sweet words. I'll write right now. Hey, what have you written? Not here, come. What is this? I'm watching you for long. If you alone keep filling up water, what should the others do? They'll fill up when it's their turn. Why then is there a queue system. That applies to you too. One pot at a time is the system. What if the water stops while you fill 4 buckets at a time? There's my father's well. Go fetch the water there. Oh, you'll have corporation water. And we should get water from your father's filthy well? Yes. Would anyone stay alive after drinking that water? He'll die instantly. Then wait till I'm finished and then get your water. Don't trigger my anger in the morning. I'm getting late for office. Pour two buckets for me and do whatever the hell you like after that. What'll you do if I don't? Good you asked. You ask me what I'll do? I'll take this pot and fill my bucket. Then. Take this pot too and fill my bucket. After that. Take this bucket and pour into mine. Not filled? I'll fill mine with this pot. Now you see? Oh you'll do that? You know what I'll do? I'll take this one in one hand. And hold that one in the other. And leave. Where to? [Spits in the bucket] You! You! What is it dear? He's spit in all the buckets I had filled. What's all this Ganesha? I must slap myself with slippers for renting a house to a person like you. Only that I'm not wearing any. I'm wearing. Do you want mine? Ganesh. I'm also getting late for office. May I have a bucket of water? I've spit in these. That's alright. It's your spit, right? I like that. Then we'll do one thing. You fill up on water. I'll come later and spit in it. Sir. We need a week's leave. 1 week's leave? Why? We have to attend a wedding. Whose wedding? Our parents' wedding. Your parents' wedding? Yes sir. How were you born without your parents getting married? We don't know all that sir. We'll ask our parents and let you know. Mother, how were we born without you and father getting married? Shut your mouth. You naughty child. Our teacher asked us that. Who's that teacher of yours? Isn't he ashamed to ask children such questions? Why should he be ashamed? We should be ashamed. Your father Ramanamurti must be ashamed to arrange this wedding for us, parents of two. I'm embarrassed to show my face in the office. What can we do? We got married against our parents' wishes when we were young. Now. We want to get back to them. So, we have to listen to everything they say. So? Why should we go through this at this age? We want parents' property... ...and not want to follow their conditions. How can this be? I'm not you wife at all according to them. Then what are you? In their view... One can be called a wife only if she has gone through the ceremonies. Or else... ...she'll be called a mistress. There's a wedding in our house. We want our house painted. -I'll get you the materials.- -OK. What's the labour charges. You want the whole complex painted? No, paint the whole damn street. OK sir. Paint just our house. They don't deserve this for the rent they pay. I'll show you the exact places to be painted, come. OK sir. This is grave injustice. It's been 10-12 years since our houses were painted last time. Are we living here for free? Aren't we paying anything? Let him get our houses painted too. If we all go together... ...he might agree. If he doesn't agree? Or hit us in the face when we go to him? You just shut your mouth. If he doesn't agree, we'll go to war. Who'll fight with him? The only man who can stand up to Ramanamurti... ...in this vatara... ...is you, Ganesha. Your praises have become old, Abhilasha. Inspire him in some new way. I'll pray that JayaLakshmi[goddess of victory] favours you. Looking at the pure whiteness of the paint on walls, ...we can all forget ourselves in bliss. What do you say? This is what I call an inspiration. Go hero, go. Go quarrel with him. Crushing the arrogance of that tyrant Ramanamurti... ...get our walls painted. Go hero, go. From that corner... straight... ...down till here and stop the painting. -It may be some 3.5 metres. -OK sir. Oh you've come to fight now? Please agree to our demands nicely then. What are your demands? Get our vatara painted like you're getting your house painted. You want the whole vatara painted? You think I print currency? If I speak loudly, you call me a quarrelsome man. If I speak softly, you don't listen to me. If you want me to listen to you, each should pay 50 rupees extra with their rent. Then I'll get everything painted. Or else I won't, even if you did somersaults here. I'll see. What'll you do? See that tomorrow morning. [Morning suprabhatam chants] Hey Ramanamurti! You start barking early in the morning? I'll kick you. Hey Ramanamurti! You filthy dog. You'll piss where you stand if I hit you. You want bread? You want meat? Don't be shy. Why Ramanamurti? You think I won't give you meat because this is a vegetarian vatara? I'll give you mutton. I'll give you chicken and chicken 65 too. Mister. What's all this? Dog. I know that's a dog. What are you calling it? I'm calling names to my dog. Call your dog whatever you want. Why are you abusing my father's name? I'm not abusing your father's name. My dog's name happens to Ramanamurti. I know. Because you want to abuse my father, you brought this dog and named it after my father. My dog's name has been Ramanamurti from a long time. Somebody must've named your father after it since the name suited him. What is going on? Look father. He's named the dog after you and been abusing it. He's given the dog my name? You dog! Is it true? Look Ramanamurti! Not you! Look Mr. Ramanamurti. If it had been a female dog, I would've named it Adilakshmi or Kanakalakshmi. You're right. But it's a male dog. That's why it's name is... Shut your mouth... Hold that dog, man. What is it Ganesha? You've already got the fire going? Look here. This dog. That too a stray dog. He has given it my name and has been abusing it. What Ganesha? Do you have to stoop this low to insult him? Poor man. His relatives will start arriving here from next morning. If you tied this dog here... ...and abused it like you abuse Ramanamurti, what will his relatives think of him? What is this all about Mr. Ramanamurti? Why's he acting like this? You tell me. He came yesterday night. He demanded that the whole vatara be painted. I said I don't have money, so I won't. Because there's a wedding at my house, I'm getting mine painted. So what's his problem then? If I'm getting my house painted, he wants everything painted, or else I shouldn't get painted mine too. All this ruckus over so little? Why don't you agree, sir? I don't have money at all. He's a quarrelsome guy. He might insult you in front of your guests. I'll agree to it if he sends the dog away. I'll send the dog out. He thinks he can make us dance to his tune? I won't send the dog out. It'll keep the vatara safe. Why do you want a dog for that? Isn't Ramanamurti enough? Tell him that. He has to agree to my conditions if he wants me to send the dog out. Oh, you please yield sir. OK. I agree to his conditions. You agree? You'll get everybody's house painted? I've not agreed to that condition. Then to which one? I won't get my house painted. Sixer! Are you deaf? You can't hear me honking. Where do you people come from? Madam, please turn the radio off. I can't hear the horns. Kapil is hitting sixes over sixes and you ask me turn the radio off. Are you even a man? What did you say? Nothing. Give me that. It's sixer. No sixer or boundary. You go on. He's hitting sixers. Please stop here. I'll enquire about the address. Sir. A moment. This address. Do you know where it is? My home's address. Hey Govinda. Hey Ramana. It's been so many years since we last met, Govinda. I'm happy too to have met you after a long time. My wife's sitting in the auto. Let's surprise her. Where's my wife? Look there. Now it's difficult to bring her back. -Please wait here. I'll be back. -OK. I'll be back in a moment. Hey. Who's this indecent man to put hands on me? I'm your husband. I've found the address, come. Wait a second. There's only one run to win. Idiot! You turn it off at the crucial moment? Hey get that man. Beat him, kick him. Definitely I won't watch TV anymore. Please let me go. I'll turn it back on. Don't know what's happening with the match. Give me my cap. What happened? Your husband died. Your cricket craze has made me crazy. What if someone looks at me? Govinda. You've come back to hit me? It's me Govinda. Oh it's you. What's happened to you? This is all my wife's doing. Put your coat on. Or else somebody will throw stones at you. Come let's go to the house. Come. Come. Be careful, it's slippery. Careful, it's slippery. Come. This is my daughter. -Namaskara. -Happy to meet you. -I'm going to market. -Come back soon. Come. Kanaka. Kanaka. Look who has come. Mr. Govinda Rao. Satyabhama. It's been years since we met last time. What's happened with the match? What match? She means cricket. She's crazy about cricket. That's why I'm roaming around like a crazy person. Sit down. I'll get you coffee. Come change your clothes. Anyway I'm going to my son's house. I'll change there. -This coat will do for now. -Then sit. -Tell me... -You come sit first. Instead of taking me to address I asked for, you have brought me to your home. That address is mine. Who do you wanted to meet here? My son. Son? Who could that be in this vatara? Ganesha. Ganesha? What happened? You look worried when I mention the name, Ganesha. He's very quarrelsome. Ever since he came to this vatara, there is not a single day he goes without fighting with me. You mean father-in-law and son-in-law are already at loggerheads? In-laws? Yes. Haven't you told your wife? You see. We always talked about this. For our friendship to remain forever, we must have a relation. So... We wished that he may have a girl and I, a boy. By god's grace, it happened so. Mr.Ramanamurti! Coming. One minute. Rent. This wasn't urgent. There's someone here to see you, come. -I should come inside? -Come I say. Father, Mother. When did you come? We came just now. -Are you well? -I'm good mother. Are you taking lunch breaks and tea breaks properly? One can forget anything but not those. But what are you doing here instead of coming home? You mean this is a jungle? Ganesha. Who do you think this Ramanamurti is? He's my childhood friend. Couldn't you have written to me that you were staying in his house? How would I know that he is your friend? When would he write to you when he hasn't got the time to fight, ? What is this Ganesha? I'm told you fight with him. Mother, this is Bengaluru. One can survive only with big mouth. You won't understand all this. Come home when you're done talking. Govinda. Both of you have come. Stay here for three days... ...and attend my daughter's wedding. Daughter's wedding? Then our relation? It's my elder daughter's wedding. You mean there's another? Then it's fine. I'll leave now. Come later. We can chat. I'll leave. What's this? You've raised a parrot like daughter and are feeding it to that vulture, Ganesha? On the other hand my brother's son, Parameshi is dying to marry her. I too have sense. I won't give my daughter's hand to Ganesha. Nor to Parameshi. Why not Parameshi? What do you mean why? He's in cinema field. He will have enough vices. Let the wedding get over first. I'll talk to you after that. Take this Mangalya. Father, see how Shamu is hitting me. I'm busy. You go play now. I'll come to you later. Come teach him a lesson now. Don't create trouble, girl. Your father is getting married. Go my child. You can marry later. Come now. Won't you listen? Go now. What is this Ramana? Is it the second marriage for him? It's not like that. Then these children? It's theirs. What do you mean? They eloped and got married at the registration office. That's why I had cut off all contacts until now. They came back. I put a few conditions and they agreed and thus we're having this wedding. You are not one to budge. All those who want to gift the couple, can do now. The wedding is getting over there. What are you doing sitting here? I'm packing a present for Vasantalakshmi. These torn clothes. It's too much man. There is a limit to prank someone. Would you not be insulting them when you give it in the wedding? What insult? Old clothes for an old wedding. What are you giving? Stainless steel tiffin carrier. You have no sense. He takes 500 rupees as rent. We may need this for ourselves. Whatever you may gift... ...whether they like it or not... ...they must keep that, right? With these old clothes, they can exchange it for any new utensils. To bride or groom? Bride. From Ganesha. From Ganesha. Ganesha's gift with all his best wishes. Please have lunch before you leave. Hey Adilakshmi, get me a cup of coffee. You're not from groom's side. You're from bride's side. Go get it yourself. That red saree suits your anger. Where is soda glass? Are you scared that I may tease you in front of everyone? Shruti is here. This wedding will shine if she sang one song for everyone. Sir. Are you talking about that Radio singer Shruthi? Yes. Is she here? Yes. Hey Ganesha, you're in luck. What happened? Shruthi has come to this wedding. Has she? Where? See there. There's the man from the radio. We'll know from him. Come. It's getting late. Shall we leave? -Sir, Just a moment. -What? He wants to ask you something. Can you show me where Shruthi is? Who are you? I'm her fan. What do you mean? I've written 25 letters, sir. Oh, you're that Y. G. Rao who wrote those 25 letters. Yes sir. He has his heart set on her. Please show her sir. See there. That woman in red saree. She's her. Thank you, sir. Namaskara. Namaskara. She looks like a drum. I'm not interested in how she looks... ...but only in her sweet voice. Namaskara. I'm Y. G. Rao working in insurance. I've written you 25 letters. To All India Radio. Y. G. Rao. Y. G. Rao. I'm your fan. Fan? Why? Oh you sing so well. Me? Singing? When have you heard? I always listen to your songs on AIR radio. I get crazy listening to your songs. I've taped all your songs, you know? I, when a small girl, used to sing national anthem in school. Only that. That too in tune. Apart from that, I haven't sung anything else. She's joking. You're Shruti, aren't you? No, I'm Gajalakshmi. Your AIR director told us. That the woman wearing red saree is Shruti. Woman in red saree is inside. -Is it? -Yes. I'm sorry. -Are you too my fan? -No, he's my fan. Shastri. What's this? Everyone's wearing red saree? What can we do? We have to go to each and ask if they're Shruti. What are you doing in women's dressing room? Go out. I don't think I'll meet Shruti in this life. Why is it not possible? What's the problem in this relationship? There's no problem. Your son and my daughter are like snake and mongoose. They don't like each other. If we were to wed them, none will be able to reside in the 3 mile radius. Ramanamurti. You've got old but you haven't learnt how the world works. A man and a woman. One is positive and the other, negative. They seem incompatible only until they're far apart. Once you connect them... ...they pass current. That is called compatibility. All these fights are only until they get married. After that? Both will know everything about each other. Once they get to know the character and habits... ...they'll sort it out themselves. Govinda. Your idea is perfect. If I make the ring leader himself my son-in-law, there won't be any leader left to lead the tenants. They'll have to listen everything I say. We'll have the engagement tomorrow. It's impossible father. I should marry that loud mouth woman? Your marriage is not recently decided. It was decided 20 years ago. There's only wedding left to be done. Why can't you understand me father? All this is empty talk. I'm in love with another girl. I'll marry only her. You want me to marry that troublemaker? Yes. If these fights in the vatara are to stop, you've to agree to this wedding. There's no other way. Why are you forcing her to marry for your personal gains? If I let her go just like that... ...she might elope like her elder sister. What will I do then? Consider it your good fortune that you're marrying into Govinda's family. I've fixed the engagement for tomorrow. Be ready, that's all. Mother. I don't want to marry him. He keeps calling me soda glass and four eyes everyday. Will I get to sing if I marry that quarrelsome man? What can I do? Our Parameshi is anyway a director in cinema. I tried arranging your wedding with him thinking he would encourage your music. But... ...your father is adamant that he won't give your hand to cinema people. Mother. If you really love me, would you promise to help me? Ask whatever you want. Mother. In an insurance office... ...there's someone called Y. G. Rao. He says he loves my song very much. He says he has recorded all my radio songs and listen to them 3 times a day. Mother. If I marry him, he'll encourage my music... ...and wish will be fulfilled. Okay. I just want your music to be encouraged. Bring him home tomorrow. We'll decide something. Not possible mother. I haven't met him. Then what can I do dear? Somehow please stop the engagement tomorrow. I'll bring Y. G. Rao. You've an excuse for that yourself. -What is it? -Come here. Namaskara Ramanamurti. Namaskara Ramakrishna Shastri, please come. I've calculated the date and time 4 times. Today evening from 5:30 to 6:30 is the most auspicious time for the engagement. I've brought a list of required items for the ceremony. Take it. Shastriji, please be punctual for the ceremony. You might forget this and go for some funeral ceremony. Don't worry. Be it the wedding or your own funeral, I will be the priest for all the ceremonies in your home. You're right. I just said it in jest. The engagement will happen come what may. How can it happen? Come here. See there. Bad omen. -When did it happen? -This morning. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Friday will be the fifth day. What shall we do now? Cancel the engagement today and conduct it on Friday. Thank God. By god's grace this engagement got cancelled. Don't sit quietly now. It's back on Friday. First write a letter to your dear Shruti. Yes mother. I'll write to Y. G. Rao today. It's best that you meet him as soon as possible. Now that I've seen his ominous face, my work won't get done. No work gets done when I see her dreadful face. Why are you following me? I'm not following you. I'm going to the post office. Give me an inland letter. I have no change. Please give me. Please give change. When she says she doesn't have change, what are you standing here for? Don't start your fight here. Give me change if you have any. I don't carry loose change to give it to whomever asks. Give way. Give me two inland letters. I'm giving it to you with pity. Thanks. I'll throw your money back once I reach home. There's no dearth for this arrogance. You have to come write here? Go there. Don't know whose face I saw this morning. She comes wherever I go. Nuisance. To my dear Shruti, To my love Y. G. Rao, My father is trying to wed me to a girl. I can't marry him. I love you very much. I've decided to marry you. I have to meet you as soon as possible. I want to tell you all that is in my heart. So, you must come to the Ganesha temple on Thursday at 5:00 PM. I will be waiting for you praying to Ganesha. If you disappoint me on Thursday, I won't try to find you again. Yours,... Can you lend me your pen? I won't. -No, put it in showcase and worship it. -Yes, I will. Sir, would you please lend me your pen? Your admirer, Y. G. Rao. It's raining. Put wipers on your glasses. You've to come here too. Go there. I'll put it here. I pray that you get him with Lord Ganesha's blessings. Don't know if that Y. G. Rao is... ...an old man or young... or limp... He can't be a deaf. Because he has listened and liked my songs on Radio. And he can't be blind too. Because he has written letters to me. You're loving him without knowing who or how he is. Yours is really a unique love story. Anyway, while going to meet him, wear that green dress. You look good in it. He must like you as soon as he sees you. She definitely won't like you. If you wear this dress. Then what should I wear? Is it enough that you love her? You must also learn how to attract your lover. Wear your cream shirt with brown pant. She'll fall for you the instant she sees you. Leave your glasses at home. Why do you want to show your weaknesses in the first meet? Okay. Very good. See how you look now. I wish your love is successful. And may Ganesha get married soon. May that Rao like by Lord Ganesha's blessings. You're going without your glasses? Where are you going? Is it auspicious to ask someone where they're going? Now my work is ruined. I'll sit for a while and then leave. Sit, sit. You're going for something good? It seems like it would rain. Your work seems like ruined anyway. Oh god, it is raining. Take this. Where are you going? To my friend's wedding. You want to attend that wedding in this rain? Go back inside. I had a good opportunity today. To meet Y. G. Rao. Father foiled all my plans. I can't help you anymore. I hoped that you'd become a big singer by marrying him. And so I helped you as much as I could. What does it matter now? I missed my chance. Injustice. If I'd met Shruti today, all problems would have been solved. Looks like you and Shruti are not meant to be together. You just marry Adilakshmi like your father says. That's not possible mother. You can't say that. Your father is hell bent on having the engagement this Friday. What shall we do now? Now, you just sleep. Your father might get angry hearing you. If one stuffs oneself because it was free, this is what happens. I had bought the colour TV just days ago. And also the new tape recorder. And the radio. They stole everything, those thieves. It's all one's fate. Shastri, what did you say that day? You said dog wasn't needed and Ramanamurti was enough to guard the vatara. But did Ramanamurti bark yesterday when the thieves broke in? What if my dog was there? You're right, Ganesh. It was a tiger that you had brought, not a dog. It's eyes were extraordinary. Like yours. Mr. Ramanamurti. I've written the report. Please sign here. You don't worry. We'll catch the thief and get your things back. Bad things are happening ever since we decided to have this engagement. Why do you worry about that? I'm not worried even though I'm the father of the groom. Come what may, the engagement will happen tomorrow. Bring the bride and groom. Father, Please leave me. I don't want this marriage. I won't tolerate if you say anything more. I'll hang myself. Ganesha. Even though he didn't like going, didn't Kapil Dev go to New Zealand and won the series? Life is also like that. Please come and sit. Ah, the heavenly beauty. Look at her face. Four eyes. Oh god, please stop this engagement somehow. Come girl. Come boy. Enter the field my boy. Your son looks handsome. Do something and stop this. I can't think of anything. If god wills it, it will stop on its own. Both the fathers exchange the Tambula offering. Mr. Ramanamurti. A happy news. We found your stolen things. You can come to the station, identify them and bring them home. Fortune must favour like this. -This is all my son's luck. -Yes, yes. It's my great fortune that he's going to be my son-in-law. You've been a great help, Inspector. You've come here. It's my daughter's engagement. With my son. Please have lunch here. Inspector! Why are you slapping me? You're acting too much. You dare slap an inspector who's on duty? I'll...I'll... Ganesha. Are you out of your mind? It's this inspector who's out of his mind. Please forgive my son, inspector. Please let my son go. Let him go? I'll kick him and put him in jail. Ganesha. Shastri. What happened to Ganesha suddenly? That is what I'm thinking about. I haven't seen him act like that before. What made him act like that? You're all standing here thinking about. Go and get him released. Or else the police will beat him to death like Kapil hit 176 runs against Zimbabwe. Rascal. You have such arrogance as to hit a uniformed police officer? Please forgive me. I'll tell you why I hit you. If you want to hit me even after that... ...you can hit me with the belt or your boot. I'll take it. What is that big reason? Sir. I'm a lover, sir. I'm in love with a girl called Shruti. I'm determined to marry her. But my father was going to wed me to that loudmouth Adilakshmi. I tried many things to get out of this. Everything failed. My luck! You came at the most opportune time. Not finding any other way to get out of the engagement, I slapped on your cheek. I thought you'd arrest me immediately. You didn't. I hit you again. You didn't arrest me even then. So, I had to keep slapping you till you arrested me. Sir, now tell me. Did I do anything wrong? Sir? Sir? What are you thinking? I was thinking of my past. You won't beat me? Definitely not. I would go to hell if I beat a devoted lover like you. Sir? Tears in your eyes? Where else can the tears come from? It comes there when one is sad, isn't it? Why are you sad? I loved a girl. But I married someone else because my father forced me to. I'm sad thinking that I didn't have courage like you back then. Go now. Bring Shruti here. I'll tell your parents and get you two married in this police station itself. Go. Thank you sir. Thank you. I'll bring Shruti as soon as I find her. -Namaskara sir. -Namaskara. Govinda. Tomorrow is new moon's day. After that it's Aashaadha. We won't be able to do anything the whole month. So we'll beg or bribe the police and get him released. Yes. Sir, they're all coming. Please put me back in jail. Please don't release me today sir. Or else they'll take me and complete the engagement. Constable, lock the cell. May god bless you. Ganesha. Oh Ganesha. Do you think this is your home to barge in? Our boy has done an innocent mistake. He hit a wrong shot like a rookie batsman. The engagement will get cancelled. Please let him go for only sometime. We'll send him back once the rituals are over. Like a batsman who returns again to the field after getting hurt. Let him go? Today he hits me, tomorrow the commissioner or the minister. We won't let that happen sir. Let's settle it between us. What's this? You're bribing me? Don't think like that. Think of it like our gift. Beware! I may have to put you in jail for bribing as per section 162. It's not like that sir. Constables! These people are causing nuisance. Throw them in the cell. Thank you sir. Thank you sir. Sir. By keeping me in jail all night, you helped me a lot. I won't forget your help in my life. I didn't help you. I helped your pure love. May your love be successful. Goodbye. Thank you sir. -Good morning Ganesh. -Good morning. What's this? I haven't seen you jogging before. I was coming to the station. I kept having bad dreams all night. I was worried what the police do to you. So I came to see you early morning. Those policemen didn't hurt you, right? Who can touch me? But I touched you now? Yours is a special case. Thank you Ganesh. But why did you slap the inspector? I didn't want to marry Adilakshmi. To escape from that I had slap him. You mean, you're in love with someone? Yes. Can I ask you who she is? You're the important person. Won't I let you know? Is she loving you too? Ours is a distant love. We are not able to meet and confess our love to each other. You should make the first move. Let the time come, I will. I'll leave. My parents must be anxious. Ganesh must definitely be loving me. Bereft of TV relay, or a commentary of a match on Radio is how son's life has become. Don't know what's happening in that police station. Go and see what happened. Nobody has to go anywhere. I came myself. Ganesha, you've come back. What is this? You were healthy like Kapil Dev. But you've become skinny like Azaruddin in only one night. Is it? Why did you suddenly slap the inspector, Ganesha? What are you asking Mr. Ramanamurti? That inspector has murdered 4 people and raped 3 women in the cell. How did you know? How do I know? It was a front page news, father. One of the murdered victim was my close friend. So, when I saw that inspector, I got this intense anger in me. An I hit him. He said he'll file a case against you? A case on me? Father I told him. I told him that I'd prove his crime. Dragging him to court... and providing evidence against him, I told him I'll have him hanged. He was terrified and shivered where he stood. He fell at my feet. He started wailing. He begged me to spare him for he had a family to look after. So, I just let him go and came back here. But... To have policemen's enmity is like to face Marshall's bouncers head on, is it not? You don't worry mother. Like Gavaskar, I will bat left handed and right handed. And I'll hit the bouncers to the boundary. Mr. Ramanamurti. Please forgive me. You're sad that your to be son-in-law has been to the jail. You're hesitating to wed your daughter to me. Yes. You're thinking of ways to end this relationship. Yes. Mr. Ramanamurti. We don't mind that. You can find another groom for your daughter... No. That's not possible. You're my son-in-law even if I die. You know why? I will feel proud to call myself your father-in-law for you have hit a corrupt police officer. My prestige too will improve as the father of this son. Govinda. You go to your town now if you want to. And come back as soon as Aashaadha ends. We can have the engagement on the first day of Shravana. Shastri. I'll pay the rent to Ramanamurti and go to the office. On the way pay Chidambarashetty of the provision store. I'll pay him next month. Why are you knocking so loud? I came to pay the rent. Count them. What is it? I ask you, what is it? That... It's the tape recorder. I'm going to be married to this man. Oh god. I'll try to meet Y. G. Rao for the last time. Please help me find him. I'm going to Gulbarga on some investigation. It'll be one week before I come back. Listen to me. In the meanwhile if Shruti calls, ask her address. Will you buy me beer? I'll buy two. Hello, who is it? It's Shruti here. Is Y. G. Rao there? Is it Shruti? He went on tour just now. Ms. Shruti. My name is Shastri. His friend. His roommate. He has asked me take your address when you call. Please can you tell me your address? Hello. Hello. Ganesha. You won't meet Shruti in this life. Change your track. Shastri. Abhilasha. Please come. Isn't Ganesha home? Ganesha is not home. He has gone on some business trip. He's gone for one week. I wanted to talk with you personally. What is it? I heard that you'd give fantastic ideas for a bottle of beer. I wanted you to give me an idea on a problem. If my wish come true after your idea, I'll buy you a beer every day as long as I'm alive. And if you want, I'll write it in my will that you get your beer after my death. Not bad. You know where the main switch is. What is your problem? I have only one wish in my life. Ganesha must become mine. This is very difficult. He is like Shri Rama. If you will... ...he can be Krishna... and I can be the gopika. You've trapped me by tempting me with beer. I can't let this opportunity go. I'll think of something. And make Ganesha come to your door. I'll handle the rest. Thank you Shastri. I won't forget your help all my life. Well that won't happen now. Let some beer flow. And Ganesha will come. Come I have a good news for you. Did you find Shruti? Not find her. She had called. What did she say? Did you get her address? She disconnected the phone as soon as I told her that you were not there. See... You and Shruti are meant to be together. It's you and Adilakshmi. That's impossible. We'll know once Shravana month arrives. Before that, give me an idea to get rid of her. I don't have an idea. I know it's in the beer bottle. What is this? You've finished two bottles and are onto the third. Love is not free, man. That is a costly item. You have to spend. Bull crap. Did you get an idea? It'll come, wait. Once the beer goes inside and churns. And there's no space for the idea to stay there, it pops out. Wait. Ganesha, I've got an idea. If you want your marriage to Adilakshmi permanently cancelled, you have to work for it. You told me to spend first and now you say I must work? What's the idea? First point. In your parents' view, Adilakshmi's character must be tarnished. This is wrong. Her future will be spoiled by that. Why do you worry about all that? You want to get away from Adilakshmi and get Shruti, right? Okay. How do you spoil her image, then? Ask me that then. Adilakshmi has a lover named Eshwar Rao. Eshwar Rao. Who's that? I too don't know. Then? This is a character I created for your love story. Adilakshmi's lover. Then? You must spend time with Abhilasha. I'll break your teeth out. You may, but wait. You hasten in everything. I asked you to spend time with her not have relationship with her. You must go to Abhilasha's house and chat with her for no reason. When Ramanamurti sees you two together, laugh loudly even if you have no reason. Even if you don't like it, you must act in such a way that he thinks badly of you. If these things happen, that Ramanamurti won't wed his daughter to you even if he dies. This is a bit risky. But the solution is permanent. Thank you man. What shall I do now? Nothing. Bring two letters tomorrow. I'll write a letter in the name of Eshwar Rao. Post it to your father. Then watch the drama unveil. Sir post. Wait I'm coming. Close the gate going out. Whose letter is it? It's come just now. Let me see who is it from. "Eshwar Rao's greetings to dear Mr. Govinda Rao." "I got to know that you were marrying Ramanamurti's daughter to your son." "I beg you as a lover." "Adilakshmi and I are lovers." "I love her deeply." "She too loves me deeply." "But scared of her parents, she's not letting this out." "So, I'm requesting you personally." "Please don't take her as your daughter-in-law..." "...and destroy our love." "Everything has gone on between the two of us." "There's nothing left." "The fact that I've seen her birthmark on her chest is the proof of the extent of our love." "Hoping that you won't part the lovers, Eshwar Rao." Who is this extra payer, Eshwar Rao? He's not the extra player. He's now become the umpire of your son's life. So, you'll break the marriage reading his letter? That also needs thinking. That is why, one or the other thing keeps disturbing the engagement. Because of that, to end this relationship... ...your parents must have decided by now. Now it's your turn. You mean? To become bad in the eyes of Ramanamurti. I must go to Abhilasha's house? You have to, if you want Shruti. The way she looks is not right. All this is just an act. I've told her everything. You remember everything that I've told you in the bar, right? Ramanamurti might be coming, go now. Ganesh. It's you? Shastri sent me here, Abhilasha. Come in Ganesh. Come. Ganesh. I waited so long to hear you call my name, you know? Sit down. That's alright. You can sit on my bed. You didn't ask me why I'm limping. That idiot Shastri didn't tell me about this. That's alright. You can ask me now. Is it okay if I ask now? Shall I ask? Why are you limping? It's all because of you. Because of me? [When Ramanamurti is looking, laugh loudly even if you have no reason] Because of me. Kanaka, that Ganesha. Come here. Look over there. You know what happened, Ganesh? I was bathing this morning. I was thinking about you. I turned like this to get the soap. And slipped and fell. See. How big the bruise is. Poor girl. See. There's a lump developed there, see. [Act in such a way that Ramanamurti thinks badly of you] Let us not give our daughter to him. Yes. I've killed two birds with one stone. Another would've been at work by now. "To dear Parents," "I got a letter this Monday." "Some Eshwar Rao." "He says he loves Adilakshmi very much." "He has written about all the personal things between them without any shame." "If I marry her," "he says he'll break my limbs and sell it off to the butcher." "Or if it gets extreme, he'll kill me." "If you don't want your only son to live," "marry me to Adilakshmi." "Or else cancel this engagement." "Your only son," "Ganesha." One that brings danger to my son's life, I can't agree to such a relation. Then... You'll cancel the Shravana month trip? I won't cancel the trip, only the match. Don't want this relationship is all. But why should I lose friendship over this? That is also right. When he comes for the engagement, we'll tell him we shall keep only our friendship and not any relationship. Why should we tell him about his son and cause him worry at this age? I told you that day. To marry our daughter to my nephew Parameshi. Did you listen to me? You said he's a cinema director and would have all the vices. I thought only cinema people will have vices. How would I know that common people too will have such vices? You can see the cinema people's dirt but can't see common people's. Now do you understand? See. Anyway my brother has come for shooting to this city. He's making a film with Vishnuvardhan. His son Parameshi is the director. Shooting is going on at Kanteerava studio. Then we'll go to the shooting spot tomorrow. We'll finish the talk there. Sir. Swapna likes you very much. She'd trying to attract you. She'd be swimming, sir. You'd go there. She'd look at you while swimming. See there. Our Parameshi is talking with Vishnuvardhan. Excuse me. One minute. Come uncle and aunt. You've finally decided to come see me shoot. My aunt's daughter, my lovely. You too are here. Parameshi. Are you well? I'm good uncle. Where's your father? He's the producer. Why would he be here. He'll be settling dues at the floor. Damu. Why are you all jumping? That's common here. Take them to my father. You can go. Father, I'll watch the shooting here. Okay. Let's go. Boy! Put two chairs here. Sit down. Shot is ready, sir. I'll be back. What's the shot, sir? You'll be loving the hero very much. You want to trap him somehow. Right then the hero enters. You... would've come out of swimming pool. You'll fall and embrace him while he's looking at you. -OK? -OK sir. Remove your gown. Jayaram. She's come out of the pool. Pour some water on her. You want me to embrace him like this? Marriage with a man like this? Yes. Nadkarni. We've come decided that our daughter shall marry Parameshi. Hearing your words is like seeing a movie win big while everyone thought it a flop. I can't believe my own ears. Well you know his nature brother. I know. When I came to ask your daughter's hand... your husband scolded me like the audience of a cancelled show. Today. He has come running to me like a distributor who has realised the value of the movie. It couldn't happen then for whatever reason. When shall we have the engagement? Good things mustn't be delayed. This is Aashaadha, brother. Yes. Let's do one thing. Parameshi and I are going to Singapore tomorrow for shooting. It'd take some 20 days to return. As soon as you're back, we'll have the engagement and finish the marriage too soon. That's all. The hero falls like this when you push him. You must fall on him and roll. OK? Like this? What are you doing? My aunt's daughter is watching. I must marry this man? That quarrelsome Ganesha is far better than this man. Why do you say like that? Until now you hated Ganesha. After looking at Parameshi, Ganesha seems far better. That's why. Why? What's wrong with Parameshi? What's wrong? I saw it all yesterday. I didn't like his behaviour at all. But you liked Ganesha's now, did you? I didn't like his too. But what to do? I couldn't find Y. G. Rao. Ganesha is only quarrelsome. I can change him after marriage. Girls these days are like this. Can't make up their minds. Look. You can bring Y. G. Rao even at the last minute. I'll consent for he admires you so much. But not this Ganesha. You were the ones who fixed that. Their parents are arriving tomorrow. Let them come. Your father has said that he'll cancel by making some excuse. -How much? -4.50 rupees. Keep the change. Oh, please come, namaskara. Keep your namaskara. Is Ganesha home? He's not in the city. It's good. It's good? Why do you say that? Isn't the engagement tomorrow? Cricket matches get cancelled for inevitable reasons. Engagement got cancelled likewise. Why? If you ask me why... I'm not in a position to answer you, Govinda. Same here. Don't ask the reason. My heart is not agreeing to this marriage. Let our friendship continue. But let us not think of a relationship. Very good. I too wanted to say the same thing. You said it. Because we both are of same mind, let us not dig into the reason. Our friendship won't be harmed by that. So. Forgetting that we cancelled this engagement... let us have sweets and meal here today. Why are they avoiding asking the reasons? What could be the reasons? Shastri. You. I came to see you. Why? What's the matter? Why are you so anxious? Not anxious. My father and Ganesha's father are cancelling the engagement. Let them. Why? You want to marry Ganesha? No, no. I thought Ganesha was better than that Parameshi. But still, both of them are avoiding asking the reason for the cancellation. I'm curious to know what are they hiding. Shastri. They say that you give ideas for one bottle of beer. Give me an idea to know what do they have in mind, please. When you have come to my doorstep offering a beer, why would I refuse? Look madam, beer is not important to me. The trust you have on me is. By the way, do you believe in god? Yes. Then it's fine. I'll give you a magic potion. You must make both your father and Ganesha's father drink it. Then see. All the secrets inside the stomach pops out. Fine. All are having dinner at my home today. I'll use that opportunity. Give me a quarter Gin. Looks like sacred Ganga water. The man who invented this must be congratulated. It won't even smell. Give it quick, Shastri. They've already sat down for dinner. Don't hasten. I've been asked to show incense to it before I give to you. Oh sacred Ganga water... Make the secrets in Ramanamurti's and Govinda Rao's stomachs tumble out as soon as possible. Please offer the fees. This one is for my father. This one's for Ganesha's father. For my mother? Give her some water. Take this. Uncle, I brought that for you. I'll give her the other. Does water carry her name? I don't drink water until it's been half an hour after dinner. Kanaka... Your city's water is interesting. Is it? Have it yourself. Yes. It's nice, isn't it? You two are filling your stomachs with only water. Really this water is tasty. Drink it if you want. You fool. Don't you know I'm taking Ayurvedic medicines? I can't drink water in the middle of a meal. Drink. Drink it Kanaka. Drink your stomach full. When you have a daughter like Adilakshmi, even poison won't affect you. Bhama. Bhama. What is this? You keep quiet. This Kanakalakshmi... ...and her daughter are putting up a nice act, I know. Oh, shut up. Act she says. Don't brag about your spoiled son. What's wrong with my son? Thank god. His good luck that this marriage broke. Yes, it's good that this marriage broke off. It prevented my daughter's life from getting ruined. To hide your daughter's flaws, you accuse my son of wrongdoing, you witch. You're the witch. Don't I know about your son's affair with that Abhilasha? Your daughter. Do you think I don't know that your daughter slept with that Eshwar Rao before marriage? Adilakshmi! Adilakshmi! What are they saying? Lies! I don't know any Eshwar Rao. Why do you lie? Your lover. Has written a detailed letter to us. Read it if you like. Bhama, what are you doing? Can't you shut your mouth? Why should I keep quiet? She's accusing my son who is like Shriramachandra. Who's that Eshwar Rao? I swear on god I don't know. After doing everything, you swear on god? You shameless! Tell me who that is. I don't know. I used to feel proud to call you as my daughter. You followed in your sister's footsteps. Will you tell me or not? Great woman. You caused this between the father and daughter. Are you happy now to see that poor girl getting beaten? You mean I must listen to every nonsense you say about my son? She's not making that up. She's saying what she's seen. Why do you yell at her? She didn't lie. She told you with evidence of the letter. We know of your son's goodness. That's why. We don't want your friendship or relationship. You can leave now. It's enough that you caused this ruckus. Leave now. We'll go. But remember. I won't step into this house again. Hey go. I'll go. Then go. Not just yours but even if your son's shadow touches me, I'll burn myself to death. Adilakshmi. Wait. We'll go in the same auto. You're going back this early? Anyway you'll come to town. I'll explain then. Come. Ganesha. Our plan was successful. Your wedding with Adilakshmi got permanently cancelled. Thank god. My responsibilities are over. I have some urgent work. I'll go. Mister. Until now, I thought you were only quarrelsome. I didn't know you were a provocateur. What are you saying? I heard what Shastri said to you. Meaning. You're the cause of the fight that happened at my home yesterday. How would I know what happened in your house? You don't know, right? You'll know everything when you read this letter. You were celebrating that your plan succeeded. See how much I've suffered because of your plan. Look here. And look here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry Adilakshmi. I did not anticipate this would happen. You mean? This letter is also that Shastri's idea, right? Yes. To be frank, I did not want to marry you. No matter how much I tried, my parents didn't listen. They forced me into marriage. So... So? You tried to discredit my character? I told Shastri about this. But he didn't listen to me. Doesn't matter who's fault it is. I'm not some idle girl who wants to marry a quarrelsome like you. There's a person who's waiting for me day and night. You mean... You too are loving someone. Who is that great man? He's not a stone like you who doesn't know what love is. That's enough. Just because I'm quiet, you call me a stone? Listen. A girl with a cuckoo's voice is loving me, you know? A girl loves you? Who is that deranged girl? You call me anything. If you call my Shruti anything... Shruti? Who is that? A song bird. I have taped everything she has sung, you know? I did all this for her. But you suffered for it. That day when I came to your house to pay rent... ...you were this song on the recorder. "I'm a flower in the garden of love" That's Shruti. How's her voice? It's very nice. That's alright. You may love her. But does she love you? Why wouldn't she love me? Shall I show you her love letters? See. One shouldn't share the love letters. But since you doubted me, I'm giving it to you. Why do you lie? She has written this letter to someone called Y. G. Rao. I'm that Y. G. Rao. When she has a beautiful name Shruti, how can I tell her that my name is Ganesha? So, I shortened the name Y. Ganesh Rao to Y. G. Rao and wrote letters. I'm that Y. G. Rao. You mean... You are my dear Y. G. Rao? I'm Y. G. Rao. But not your dear Y. G. Rao. The Shruti that you so admire is none other. It's me. You're Shruti? Yes. Adilakshmi at home but Shruti only on radio. Look here. Your letters. Shruti. Y. G. Rao. Shruti. Come on. Sing me a song. Why? You want confirm it's really me? Oh, come my son-in-law. Kanaka. Son-in-law has come. Parameshi. When did you comeback from Singapore? I came on first flight today. Good. Come. Your father didn't come, Parameshi? He had to settle some dues, auntie. He said he'll come later. My auntie's daughter, a ball of pearl. She looks lovely even though she shies behind those four eyes. That is why I'm giving her hand to you. Parameshi, you take rest. We can talk after lunch. Kanaka. Give him some coffee. I'll go to Siddapura and be back. Okay uncle. Come here. Parameshi, I'll bring you some coffee. Okay. Mother, I'll give him the coffee. He's not married you yet. And you can't wait to talk to him. When coffee from your hands taste so good, the coffee from your lips would taste... Would be nice if I give you a slap on your cheek. Parameshi. I wanted to talk to you in private. Shall we go to the terrace? Would you help me? Would you listen to me? Now I won't listen to anything. But after marriage... ...I will dance to your tune. Tell your father that you don't want to marry me. Why? Both my father and I are eagerly waiting to marry you. Both you and your father will marry me? I'll marry you. My father will take you as daughter-in-law. But I don't want to marry you. I've given my heart to someone. Get it back. My life would be wasted if I don't marry the one I love. And you wouldn't be happy too. Is that all? Don't worry. After our first night, love will come. After a kid, it'll be permanent. I have vowed to not leave this house without marrying you. He's so stubborn? That idiot. What shall we do now? What to do? You tell your father. And I'll tell mine. Then they'll marry me off to Parameshi as soon as possible. So, we must break that marriage first. Then we'll lay groundwork for ours. Right? Then what shall we do now? What if we buy Shastri a beer? He gets only nasty ideas. Instead give me a sweet. I might get inspired and get an idea. Then come we'll go to the sweet shop. What? The sweets. In the shop? You too are a novice in love like me. Sweet means... Got it. Got an idea. My tummy hurts. What happened? I'm dying in pain. Uncle, I'll take her to the doctor. Come. I won't come with you anywhere before the wedding. What shall we do now? I'll take her. Take her. Father. There's a doctor at the end of our street. He's foreign returned. His name is Bilahari. They say he's very good. He has read all kinds of things. Is it? We shall go there, father. Give me my umbrella. You understand everything, right? Okay. You're not an office clerk now. Don't worry. My name is Dr. Bilahari. Here they come. They've come? Oh, come, come. Come, I was waiting for you. Were you? How did you know my daughter had stomach pain? Not like that. I meant I was waiting for patients. Please see her doctor. She complains of severe stomach pain. Don't worry. Dr. Bilahari will take care. You sit here. You come in, lady. But I... No, you sit there. Come. Doctor. It's very urgent, doctor. Is it so? He says it's very urgent. I'll give you a tablet. You keep chewing on it outside. I'll finish with him by then. Come inside. So what's the matter? Did you test my blood? I did. Before I tell you the result, I'll ask you some questions. You must answer them correctly. What is it doctor? Had you been to a foreign country recently? I had been to Singapore for shooting. It's been 3 days since I came back. Which cinema? Who's the director? "Secrets of nature" is the name. Parameshi's the director. What is this? It's common for people to smuggle goods from Singapore. But you have come back with a deadly disease called AIDS. AIDS? Yes. Did you have unprotected sex with any women there? Since we had been away from home long... ...we had been to a place. That's why you have contracted this disease. But did you go there alone? No, no. The director and I are close friends. We share everything. So, Parameshi and I had been there together. Ah, you see... Because you both shared the same woman... ...Parameshi too will have contracted this disease. Shall I bring him too for the test, doctor? No. Don't tell him this. He can at least spend his time peacefully. He'll die soon if he comes to know that he has AIDS. How do we know that we have this disease, doctor? Ah, you asked the right question. See... If one starts vomiting, he continues to do so for another 20 times. If the diarrhea starts, it continues to go on for some 20 times. One always feels sleepy. They doze off where they are. You are correct, doctor. I'm having the same symptoms. Isn't there a cure for this disease? Cure for this? There's no medicine for this. And no one survives this disease. For the sins I've committed, I'll bear the punishment. I'll leave, doctor. You acted well. Take this. Now you go. Go. Be careful. Don't tell Parameshi that he has AIDS. Come inside. Parameshi has... Who knows? He's from cinema. How's your father? He's believed this 90%. And if Parameshi starts vomiting, he'll believe it 100%. Well it's in your hands now. Parameshi. In Singapore, there are many beautiful spots. My father was a big nuisance. He restricted us from roaming around freely. He's a fool. Take this juice. Thank you. What is this? You got well so soon? Doctor is very good, father. Good man. Wait. He's telling his stories from Singapore. Sit. After that. If we wanted to go to a place of liking, we had to go without telling my father. What happened? I feel like vomiting. I had been to the casino. You feel like vomiting again? [If one starts vomiting, he continues to do so for another 20 times.] He's vomiting unceasingly. Let's take him to the doctor. Not required. He'll be alright after he drinks a cup of buttermilk. Poor man. It shouldn't have happened to Parameshi. I'll bring buttermilk. He's very tired. Put him on bed. Uncle. I'm not that tired. Must be because of the food. Drink this buttermilk. It'll stop the vomiting. When you give it with your hand, everything will stop. Uncle, come sit here. I'll tell you our shooting jokes. You'll enjoy them. What happened that day was... What happened was... What happened was... What happened? You feel like going to bathroom? Yes, yes. You're correct. What's happening?It was vomiting until now. Now diarrhea. Go bring a doctor. You keep quiet. The reason for it is something else. I'll tell you later. Uncle. Where did I stop? You had stopped at going to the bathroom. You're joking. What happened in Singapore was... Did diarrhea happen there too? Looks like that, uncle. [If the diarrhea starts, it continues to go on for some 20 times.] You're very tired. I'll bring you Electral. You'll gain some strength. And if you have lunch and sleep, you'll be totally alright. He feels sleepy all the time. He dozes off wherever he is. Parameshi. Drink this Electral, everything will be alright. Father, I have laid out the banana leaf for lunch. Bring him. Hold him. Shall we go? Come. The sambar is very tasty Parameshi. Have some more. Parameshi? [One always feels sleepy.] [They doze off wherever they are.] Parameshi. Don't touch him. Why? I'll tell you later. Success. So, my first plan is successful. Now the second plan is dependent on your acting skills. Tell me what to do. I'm ready. Then let's begin. Mother. Our neighbour, Satyavati. That two braids lady. She died. Is it? What happened? Don't know what happened between the husband and wife. She immolated herself with kerosene. And also wrote a death note blaming her husband for her death. The police have arrested him. They will hang in a few days. Poor thing. I feel the same pity when I look at Parameshi. Why? They'll hang him after 3 months of marriage. It's Friday today. What nonsense are you talking. Then what? You're forcing me to marry him. I too told him not to marry me. He didn't listen. So, I thought why must I disappoint you. I'll marry him. And one day. I'll ask him to bring kerosene. He'll bring. Writing a note that he killed me for dowry, I'll immolate myself with that kerosene. And then the police will come. They'll kick Parameshi. And drag him. And hang him. You devil! She wishes bad to the husband. I won't have anything to do with her. I must first run from here. Finally we sent Parameshi and his father running. Now, we must run away. Don't say that. My father is hurt because my sister eloped. I don't want to hurt my father. Your father has challenged my father that he'll burn himself if he ever saw even my shadow. We shall convince him somehow. I'll give an idea for that. You? I'm bored of giving all nasty ideas. Give me a chance to give you a good idea this time. But... I won't buy you a beer. No need. If my idea succeeds and you get married, that'll be enough. What's the idea? Ramanamurti. What is it? I want to marry your daughter. How dare you say that? Why should I fear to tell the truth? I love your daughter. I can't let an immoral man marry my daughter. Why do you say that? You want me to list your deeds? You were flirting with Abhilasha that day... What's all that? Please forgive me, Ramanamurti. It was an act that I put up to make you think that I was a bad man. What was the need? See, As you know... I didn't know that Shruti and Adilakshmi were the same person. Going crazy after her voice, I wanted to marry Shruti. So I did all this to avoid marrying Adilakshmi. That turned into this big. You mean the person who wrote letters to Shruti... I'm that Y. G. Rao. This is the proof that your daughter wrote letters to me. Whenever we wanted to meet, destiny didn't let that happen. What is he saying? I'll you later. First give your consent to this wedding. That's not possible. I won't give consent even if I die. You have to. What if I don't? Down, down Ramanamurti! Adilakshmi and Ganesha must marry! Down with Ramanamurti! Victory to Ganesha's wedding! You were all protesting for water and electricity until now. This is your new demand? Yes. Until you wed your daughter Adilakshmi to our leader Ganesha, we'll keep protesting like this. What if I don't? What if we don't pay our rent? I'll throw you out of the house. Will we go silently? We would write to rent control before we go. We have already notified the taxmen at the municipal corporation. They may be on their way. What is the actual rent you are getting? We'll prove that you are forging the numbers. And we'll send you to jail for falsifying data to the government. Oh the taxmen are here. Tax officer! Who is Ramanamurti here? He is! Would you come down? Or should I come up? Tax officer Chandru! What are you doing here? The house owners are not giving proper accounts to the government these days. They take high rent. And report a different number. So, I came to survey. Please do. Shastri, my dear boy. Come up here. I'll. One minute. Shastri. You know how to calm my heartbeat. I'll buy you a beer. That's not required. You want me to send that tax officer back, right? Please save me from him. Come with me. You must agree to everything we say. If you say no, I'll leave you then and there. I'll do as you say. OK come. Mr. Chandru. He is... -Namaskara. -Namaskara. What Mr. Ramanamurti? Sir? Is this your vatara? Yes sir. Are these your tenants? No, no. How much rent do you pay? Why must I pay rent? I'm his son-in-law. Son-in-law. Is it true? Shastri, What is this? Say yes. Yes. His elder daughter eloped with someone. Not wanting his younger daughter to follow her, he married us together. He has let us stay here with him. Is it not father? Who will ask rent from daughter and son-in-law? Correct. Who is she? She's Ramanamurti's sister. I am... You keep quiet. My sister's husband. I'm Ramanamurti's uncle. Vamanamurti. Go back. Come here. Who's he? I'm his younger brother. Brother? There's no similarity between you two. My mother gave birth to him on new moon's day. And me on full moon's day. That's why the dissimilarity. So, that's why you look fair and he, dark. All that is fine. I have doubts on this person. Mister. Go bring your wife. You will believe him only when you see a mangal sutra in his wife's neck? Of course. Ganesha. Shall I bring her father? Go bring her. Ganesha. Tie the mangalsutra and bring her. You don't tie. Ask her to tie it herself. Okay father. It's perfect, come. Please excuse us. Father, I brought her. Officer, look. She's my wife. Did you see officer? My daughter and her husband are happy. The couple are made for each other. Oh, come, come. Who's she? She's Ramanamurti's second wife. What is this? It's all lies. Now I believe you. Mr. Ramanamurti, I've noted this place as self-occupied. I'll leave. Thank you, Chandru. I'll meet you in the bar. The officer's gone. Take your hands off. What's it to you if he puts hands on his wife? You take your hands off. Shastri. You promised me that you'd make Ganesha mine. Don't worry Abhilasha. What if you don't get Ganesha? I'll set you up with his father. What's all this? You're talking about Ganesha's father. What did you write in the letter and what's going here? That. Ramanamurti, you tell him. They got everything settled themselves. You mean the marriage is over? Not yet. About to happen. They say there're 108 obstacles to lord Ganesha's wedding. Don't know what will come up now. Stop it a moment. Bring the garlands. This is for you. Take this. There's still two more left. Shastri... Who? Ravi Shastri? Not him. It's our vatara's Shastri. Girl will be wasted. Hold this. Take this. Everybody put them together. You start playing. So, finally Ganesha'a wedding is over. What did you think? You'll read that in paper tomorrow. They'll write in the paper what they thought of the movie. You tell the people what you thought of the movie. [If you enjoyed watching Ganesha's wedding, it would be worth our efforts] - Kalaapriya
