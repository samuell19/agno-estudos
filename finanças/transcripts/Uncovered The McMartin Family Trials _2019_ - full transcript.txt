I was two going on three when I started going to McMartin. McMartin Preschool was a premiere preschool in Manhattan Beach. The preschool was a trusted neighborhood business. I couldn't imagine what was going on over there. The child said that Raymond Buckey had molested him. They take your most prized possession and try to dement it. I was this three‐year‐old little girl being made to stand in front of people and have pictures taken of her when she was naked. Small animals were actually slaughtered in the children's presence in order to frighten them into submission. Several defendants are accused of molesting children, including 76‐year‐old Virginia McMartin, her daughter, and two grandchildren. Searches were made in every location. They found nothing. I'm Pac‐Man and my job is to get to hear yucky secrets. These children are not telling the same story. They had a plan to use this case to get elected into office. We may be going back to the grand jury with additional counts. When you turn on the TV for news, all of the channels, the lead story was McMartin. The number of possible victims have multiplied to say the least. It was blasted daily. It became totally unwieldy. We thought there was no end in sight. This is much too important a case to allow it to hang out there with such a great question mark. Raymond Buckey, how do you plead? I'm not guilty, Your Honor. All of them lost everything they had. Things happened there that were so terrible. My daughter is still in therapy and she's 37. I know I was molested at McMartin Preschool. Manhattan Beach in the '80s was kind of a comfortable beach town. It was a family‐oriented community, small town feel despite being in Los Angeles County. So it was kind of a bubble or a cocoon. Back then, we didn't lock our doors. The parents that I knew were highly educated professional people. Their children got the very, very best. I had some friends in the area that told us "Oh, this is the school to go to." It sounded like a good place to go. It was a cute little building and set‐up. Had a very good reputation in the community. I was two going on three when I started going to McMartin. I always remember that there was a Valentine's Day party and I remember the heart‐shaped cookies. They had a great reputation. They had been in town ever since I can remember. There was actually a waiting list. They had colorful toys in the yard, so the kids were all drawn to that. And I thought Virginia was cute, a cute old lady. Virginia McMartin, I think she started the school in 1956. She had gotten a Rose and Scroll Award in 1977, which is the city's highest honor. It's like the Woman of the Year Award. The McMartin Preschool was led by Virginia McMartin, her daughter, Peggy McMartin Buckey, along with her grandchildren, Peggy and Raymond Buckey. It was a prestigious school with teachers that had been there dozens of years. Most of the teachers were older. These teachers were highly regarded and respected members of their community. It's a trusted neighborhood business. At that point, I couldn't imagine what was going on over there. Manhattan Beach Police Department. Uh, my name is Judy Johnson and I want to report a crime. Yes, ma'am. My two‐year‐old son has been molested at the McMartin Preschool. The Manhattan Beach Police Department is a small department and they had a female officer named Jane Hoag who was kind of a tough old‐school cop, and so she interviewed the child. And the child was two and a half years old, had said that Raymond Buckey had molested him. The child was examined by a doctor at UCLA. And the doctor found something consistent with molestation. And based on that examination, Raymond Buckey was arrested. So now you have this investigation of a child‐abuse suspect. Word of it had gotten out. They had to explain it somehow. Judy Johnson mentioned that her child had said two other kids were abused. So the Manhattan Beach Police Department wrote up a very succinct simple letter which went out to the McMartin parents. It said, "We don't wish to cause alarm but if you could talk to your children, we'd appreciate it and if you have any concerns, please call us." At the basis of it was this long warning advisory for all the parents to go out and talk to their kids, and their families, and their friends about molestation that was going on. It happened to some kids, it may have happened to your kids too. The letter that went out to the parents, it was gunpowder set off in the community. They were saying that your kid, up until that day the letter arrived, was to you and your wife, husband, whatever, normal, just going to school and living a good life. And all of a sudden, he or she had been molested for years and you didn't know about it? It just scared everybody. It seemed like at that point there was a lot of kind of paranoia. We didn't know if it was just a couple of people and I was pretty worried about my child. The letter talked about Ray Buckey and I didn't know Ray Buckey. So I asked my daughter, do you know him? And she said, "Yeah, Mr. Ray." Yeah, I was just in shock. I sat my son down in his bedroom and had a discussion with him. At that point, he was in kindergarten and he said to me, "Dad, have they been arrested?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Are they going to get out?" And I fibbed to him and said, "No." And my son was deathly afraid that they were gonna come and hurt me. But child abuse is a‐‐ is a hard pill to swallow. I didn't really think it would happen. So I remained very calm and assured him that no one would hurt him. There was some, uh, pushback from people who were supportive of the school, and thought "Geez, you know, we've known Virginia, we've known the teachers for 20 years. We've had three, four kids go through their school and this would not have happened." When we got the letter, we thought, well, this‐‐ Elizabeth was not involved. There was just no way. I had no clue that that was something that a human being would even do. It was beyond my imagination. It didn't make sense. And my job is to get to hear yucky secrets. Kee McFarlane asked questions with the puppets. It got the children to talk. Kee McFarlane reported to the parents that, in her opinion, the children had been abused. The mass hysteria of the moment. It created the appearance of utter depravity. Children from the McMartin School have reportedly alleged that Ray Buckey brandished guns in front of them. I know my son. And he has not harmed one child. For a three‐, four‐, five‐year‐old to talk about detailed sexual activity... Unless they experienced it, how would they be able to describe it? So you think you're just being framed, huh? I don't think it. I know it. The Manhattan Beach Police Department sent out a letter to all the parents warning them about molestation that was going on at the McMartin Preschool. The response to the police letter was, uh, disbelief really. People just didn't think something like that would've happened at the McMartin Preschool. They thought it was a great preschool. And this goes also true for Ray. Before the so‐called exposure, there was nothing to suggest aberrant, perverse character on his part. Parents are upset that Buckey's gotten out. But the police are saying, "You know, when we get evidence, we'll arrest him. When we find the pictures, we find the corroborating witnesses, you know, we find medical evidence, we'll arrest him. We don't have any evidence. We're not arresting him." Policeman at the door saying the school was under investigation. Did you decide to leave your kid? We took her home. The parents weren't happy with the way the Manhattan Beach Police talked to their children. And the DA suggested a more appropriate interviewer might be Kee McFarlane at Children's Institute International. ...get to hear yucky secrets. And I don't mind hearing them. Kee MacFarlane had a charisma and asked questions with the puppets. It got the children to talk. I remember being interviewed at CII. And I remember talking about experiences that had happened. It's not like I just remembered the bad stuff. There were good things I remember. You know, I remember playing... and then I remember some of the classrooms, and then I have flashes of some of the not‐so‐nice memories... when it was just me and Ray Buckey. Elizabeth was interviewed at CII. They came back and told us that she had been abused. The shock and the emotions are just overwhelming. I mean, you‐‐ as a man, you feel a sense of guilt. You haven't protected your family. You're in shock, you don't wanna believe it, but you're faced with evidence that it happened. And now what do you do, you know? Kee MacFarlane started reporting to the parents that in her opinion, the children had been abused. So, parents withdraw their kids from the McMartin Preschool. I am the director at that school. I do know what is going on. I know my son, and he has not harmed one child. Not one. You know, within a, I don't know, a month, two months, uh, Virginia had closed the school. Manhattan Police continued to investigate and the children were referred to CII's doctor, Astrid Heger, who was a reported expert in child abuse examinations. My role in this case was to be the medical doctor that examined the children for evidence of abuse. I got involved in the McMartin case because I had began to question the issue of why child sex abuse cases never went to court, or rarely went to court. And I'm going, "How are you documenting?" You're just documenting on a piece of paper. You're writing down what you see. And that's not scientific. Nobody had ever taken pictures before. I realized we needed to do photo documentation and then that became evidence. At Children Institute, my son was physically examined and they said that he was very likely sexually abused, that was their words. I was so angry, and so hurt, and so sad. I sat in my car, wanting to drive it through the McMartin building. And I wanted to just kick their ass, frankly. We had Elizabeth examined by Astrid. She said there was enough physical evidence to claim that there was‐‐ something happened. It's‐‐ it's just like somebody just hit me right in the stomach. Dr. Astrid Heger concluded that most of the children she photographed showed evidence of blunt force trauma, consistent with sexual abuse. Manhattan Beach Police Department. It started out here in Manhattan Beach looking like an isolated incident. One mother noticed that her young son was having nightmares and difficulty sitting down, and a redness on his bottom. Authorities would later conclude that her two‐year‐old son had been sodomized. That was last summer. In the months since then, the number of possible victims have multiplied to say the least. Wayne Satz was a highly respected, Peabody Award‐winning reporter. I'm sure he kind of thought the way any reporter would've thought, this is like a great story. And he happened to have access to Kee MacFarlane because he was dating Kee MacFarlane. That reporter had the inside information from the beginning of what these children were saying to the interviews. And it was blasted daily on Channel 7, in the most horrendous fashion. What's more, children from the McMartin School have reportedly alleged that Ray Buckey, one of the indicted suspects in this case, brandished guns in front of them, threatening to use them on family members if secrets were revealed. A child sexual abuse investigator should not talk to the media in advance of the court proceedings. The form of his story and the‐‐ the manner, it was propaganda. And it made it appear to be like this was the truth. This is happening. These are horrible people. Where there's smoke, there's fire. It was yellow journalism at its worst. Authorities now believe that at least 60 young children were victimized and that the ultimate number could well be much greater. He, like the rest of the community, and I have to say myself, presumed guilt. That's when the case started to blow up. One mother would conclude that her two‐year‐old son had been sodomized. Wayne Satz broke a secret investigation. The form of his story and the‐‐ the manner, it was propaganda. And it made it appear to be like this was the truth. Authorities now believe that at least 60 young children were victimized, and that the ultimate number could well be much greater. I was so angry, I was so hurt, so sad. And I wanted to just kick their ass. I have flashes of some of the not‐so‐nice memories when it was just me and Ray Buckey. I'm not the only puppet lady in this case there, my co‐therapist, Sandy Krebs, and our pediatrician, Astrid Heger, have gotten certainly as much as I have from these children by using puppets, even in the medical exam. Mass‐media attention. It created a situation where not only was there a presumption of guilt but the appearance of utter depravity on the part of those who were accused. There was some pushback from people who were supportive of the school. But that sentiment quickly evaporated when the number of children who allegedly were abused started going into the hundreds. I mean, there just weren't many people left to defend the McMartins. There's no doubt in my mind, on the basis of the children that I interviewed, that approximately 350 children that we saw described being sexually abused. One of the things that caused the case to explode was Kee MacFarlane, what she called her "Oh my God" moments. She'd be interviewing a kid who described being abused, but the description would describe a scene in which there had to be other people witnessing it, it'd be in the playground or in one of the classrooms, not hidden away in a bathroom, for example. So, she's thinking it couldn't have just been this one suspect, Raymond Buckey, the other teachers are implicated. May I say that, as we see it now, seven people have been named. Have the children that you've talked to named all of those seven names? Numerous times. I think they were questioned by the older people until they finally said yes ‐and agreed to it. ‐REPORTER: So, you think you're just being framed, huh? You're darn tootin' I think we're being framed. I don't think it, I know it. The DA was under pressure from the parents to have charges filed. We had medical evidence and you have children saying they were abused. So, what's left to question? And I think about this point, the politicization of that case took place. From appearances, they wanted the TV cameras. Manhattan Beach Police Department. You know, DA Van de Kamp had been appointed to Attorney General and left a vacancy, Governor Deukmejian did something to bring Philibosian in to fill the slot. He kind of liked the feeling he thought he'd run for office. Philibosian was running against the LA City Attorney Ira Reiner. His pollsters showed that most people thought Ira Reiner was already the LA County District Attorney, and they didn't know who Philibosian was. His advisors told him he needed a high‐profile case. We're talking about such acts as rape, sodomy, oral copulation, and fondling. All the cameras were on him and he's identified. That's where the ideas of child pornography were pronounced, child prostitution, satanic cult rituals. To obtain their silence, uh, these people have told the children that their parents would be harmed. And in order to back up that, uh, threat, small animals were actually slaughtered, uh, in the children's presence in order to frighten them into submission. I'm sitting in my home in, uh, West LA when I get the call, the Buckey case. I met the family, Virginia, the parents, Peggy, Chuck, and the children. I had no idea whether they were guilty or not. The word was out that people are running their campaigns on molestation cases. So the first thing I did was I got together with Ray and I said, "What we're gonna do is we're gonna go surrender you." Uh, a symbolic surrender. The DA just rejected the offer to have the client surrendered and‐‐ and brought TV cameras with him to the Buckeys' home. We have arrest warrant for Ray Buckey, we'll enter the house. The DA wanted to do a major perp walk, surprise the family. Oh, dear. That's my dog just out. Okay. We'll take care of the dog, ma'am. 1549. This is a show by an interim DA, Philibosian, on the heels of a campaign for district attorney to use this case. Bail was set at fifty thousand to a million dollars for seven preschool teachers accused of molesting children including seventy‐six‐year‐old Virginia McMartin, and her daughter, and two grandchildren. My client, Betty Raidor, taught at the school for some 20, 30 years. She was arrested and I saw her in the jail, and then she says, "Why am I here?" And I said, "Well, basically they're telling you and the world that you're a pedophile." We could be interviewing up to 100 more children in that process. As a result of those interviews, we may be going back to the grand jury with additional counts. My son started telling me stories of animals being butchered. They threatened that they would kill my family and then they would take me away and I would be with them for the rest of my life. If there's any case where there is to be no bail in a non‐capital case, this is that case. We are alleging that approximately 100 children were sexually molested at the school. The community and I'd have to say myself presumed guilt. Small animals were actually slaughtered. They had a plan to use this case and get elected into office. Tonight, Virginia McMartin is in jail along with some of her relatives and former teachers. Generally, you want your client to be out of jail, pending a trial so that when you walk down the hall with that client, the jurors are walking down the hall, and you're kind of like he's a‐‐ normalizes that person. If you're unable to do that for whatever legal reason, the jurors will realize, "Well, this person's in custody." And if he or she is in custody, there must be something there to the case. So, it's‐‐ it's not positive at all that's why we'd prefer to have them on bail. Several defendants are expected to make bail and privately many parents are upset about the possibility of them being back on the streets. The psychological trauma that will result from having these people back out on the street, people who threatened the children's lives, is immense, as I'm sure you can imagine. I think it is abundantly clear that the horrors of what we have learned today of what has occurred at that nursery school has affected an entire generation of children. The prosecutor, Lael Rubin, and Glenn Stevens, underneath the interim DA, Robert Philibosian, along with Ron George who had political ambitions of his own, did what the public wanted. If there's any case where there is to be no bail in a non‐capital case, this is that case, and each of those defendants are therefore remanded without bail. State constitutional amendments have made it possible to impose lockup, remand to custody without bail where there was a fear that the accused would be dangerous to society. They were physical, aggressive, harmful acts, and I did see a reference to a large knife being drawn across the chest of one child, burying one child in a sandy area up to the chest, uh, who had to get himself out by digging himself out with his arms. And this is stories the kids were telling, about the satanic rituals reportedly taking place with animals, and with children being killed. The kids were saying this and they believed it. The administration of drugs, threats to kill, generally the placement of sharp foreign objects into vaginal areas, and we believe turtles and rabbits are being observed bleeding and then dying thereafter. When I first met Peggy Ann, she was alone in the men's lockup. She was bright, young, late 20s, articulate. She knew what was happening but she couldn't understand it. She was bewildered, dazed in a way. She's a sensitive, community‐serving individual, she's got a master's in rehabilitative education, she teaches the handicapped, more recently the deaf in Orange County. She's locked up without bail. How could she be remanded to custody without bail as were her mother and brother under fanciful accusations that were being made in the case? My son was quite, uh, articulate about what went on. He started telling me stories of animals being butchered and cutting ears off rabbits. I get how people look at this and think it's fantastical because how do hundreds of children get molested at one school and nobody find out about it? I mean, it‐‐ it sounds crazy. Children, uh, they do make up stories, but it's from something within their realm that they've experienced, and for a three‐, four‐, five‐year‐old to talk about, uh, detailed sexual activity... Unless they experienced it, how would they be able to describe it? And to have a number of kids all saying the same thing? I never said anything to my parents that gave them any indication of anything happening before anything came out because they threatened that they would kill my family and then they would take me away, and I would be with them for the rest of my life. Authorities believe children were abused not only at the McMartin Preschool, but also at other locations. They charge, school children were allegedly taken off campus at times to be sexually assaulted. My son told me that they did take the children away from the school to other locations, and they would tell him that, "Our car broke down, we need to go into this house, and, uh, make a phone call," and then they would parade the kids into a house to be sexually abused. I remember being at what felt like an older, kind of almost Victorian type house. I remember there being more than one teacher or adults and I remember there being multiple kids. And I have memories that‐‐ that this three‐year‐old little girl was being made to stand in front of people and have pictures taken of her when she was naked. I know my daughter was taken around in the community. I mean, she showed me places that she was taken to, that I never took her to. She didn't have a driver's license. She was two and a half. So, it had to be the teachers. I asked my daughter, "How did they take you in and out of the school?" And she said, "Through the tunnels." Like I'm supposed to know. The district attorney went to the school looking for tunnels and they picked up some tile, and they, uh, dug a few inches into the dirt in the side yard, but I don't think they came up with barely anything. I took Elizabeth to the school and she walked right into a bathroom where there was just a little sink and a little toilet, and she said, "This is where the tunnel was." There was no tunnel there. I didn't see a break in the wall, I didn't see anything, but she said, "This is where we went through the tunnel." If you say so, okay. I remember being at what felt like a tunnel, and having pictures of what, to me, I thought was the devil, and there being, like, candles off the side like a light, you know, off the wall, and it was dark, and I remember going downstairs to get into it. So I went a couple of days later with my friend and her daughter, and the daughter said, "Oh, I wanna show you. This is where we went into the tunnel." How could two different kids from separate years go and show me the exact same place? Oh, I still get goosebumps. How could these teachers be remanded to custody without bail on the fanciful accusations that were being made in the case? Authorities believe children were taken off campus at times to be sexually assaulted. My son started telling me stories about animals being butchered. Police took action today in the ever‐growing McMartin child molestation case. Manhattan Beach Police, together with investigators from the DA's Office, conducted searches at nine different locations early this morning. Manhattan Beach Police Department tried to find out where these offenses may or may not have occurred. Churches where animals were slaughtered, they checked the altar for blood, there was no blood of course. Based on the continuing investigation, it would now appear that there are aspects of child pornography. Uh, many of the children are now telling us that, uh, during, uh, the course of molestations that there were lights and cameras, which would of course then lead to, uh, um, distributing pornography for profit. One aspect of the expanding investigation involves this woman, Catherine Wilson, the so‐called Queen of Kiddie Porn. Authorities want to find out whether any of the suspects in the McMartin Preschool case are linked to her operation. There was an attempt to describe how it was that these teachers at a very prestigious preschool could ever get involved in this kind of activity. These were substantially decent people. Well, this was part of a big child pornography ring. Moneymaking, well, follow the money trail. Photos used as evidence in the Wilson Kiddie Porn Case are being compared to photos of children who complained about sexual abuse at the McMartin Preschool. The sheriff's departments assigned 20 investigators, you got the Manhattan Beach investigators, you got half a dozen DA investigators, and you got the FBI, and the assumption was we've got a hundred kids that are molested, we got seven suspects, we're gonna find photographs, we're gonna find the mailman who walked in on them, we're gonna find some sort of corroborating evidence. Have you actually found any pornography printed or film material? That is something I can't get into at this particular point, at this particular point of the investigation. Okay. No corroborating evidence ever surfaced. So there was absolutely no corroboration for anything the children said. It didn't matter. The case took on a life of its own. The message was pervasive and unending, that was never gonna stop. That was a snowball. That was a witch hunt. I mean I can understand when they say a witch hunt if you have a teenager who might have a gripe against somebody or is afraid of the truth coming out making up a story. We believe the children and to this day I do not at all discount anything that they said. Danny Davis, in an effort to get the trial moved out of LA, did a poll, it was a countywide poll because he was polling potential jurors, and 90 % of the people thought these people are guilty. I feel like I've been already convicted, and how I go about proving to you or to anybody else that I'm innocent, I don't know. And it frightens me. The press was so bad that I personally had confrontations from parents when they learned that I was one of the lawyers defending the McMartin Preschool case. Some people screamed at me in a supermarket, chased me once when I was riding my bicycle. We had to do something from the defense side. So, we formed the Friends of the McMartin Preschool Defendants. We put ads in the local newspaper. And we compared the McMartin case to the Salem witch hunts. We were trying to alert people, you remember Salem witch hunt. You remember what they did then. And then of course later they said, "Oh, we were all wrong." Well, that's what we got going here, too. In the 1600s, they burned witches at the stake. Of course it was wrong because there's no such thing as witches. Well, perhaps in the minds of some there are. We have heard it a hundred and‐‐ hundred times or more from children, the same things, the same games, the same descriptions. We're lucky that Kee McFarlane, the prosecution's expert in child abuse matters, thought her technique and method was so wonderful it should be videotaped. We wanted to see these videotapes. We had to fight to get access to the tapes. The court knows that the case is now held uniformly, that the defense shall have complete access, equal access, to the evidence that is being used against the defendants. Children's Institute never thought ahead that, hey, one day, the tapes are gonna be revealed and everything that took place in this room with a child is gonna be part of the criminal record. I don't think they anticipated that. And once they learned that it was gonna happen, all hell broke loose, they did not want the defense to see what was going on at‐‐ during those interviews, that was real clear. A marvelous arrangement was reached that Ray would be transported to Beverly Hills Courthouse and given an office room in which we set up video equipment and that's how we saw the tapes... one after another. Not a one helping the prosecution at all. We were stunned by what we saw. That's it? That's what they did? The tapes for me were a large collection of evidence that proved literally this didn't happen. These videotapes show it. You have to see the videotapes to understand what they led to. It was poppycock. The first time I went to look at the tapes, I was blown away. The kids had taken pieces of stories and stringing them together. I doubt that anything ever happened at the school, based on the evidence that I've seen. I believe what our children told us, that they were molested at the school, and I can't believe this was made up. Those children had no protection once they were witnesses in the case. Some children fear Buckey will kill them if they show up in court. And those Defense Attorneys, they were bastards. They ate the kids up and spit them out. They stood there and pointed at Ray Buckey and said, "He's the guy that did this to me." I'm ready. I've been ready for five years. I'm ready for it to end. This case was clearly imbued with political campaigns. We are firmly convinced that the children were indeed molested. My son is three. I was younger than him when this stuff was happening, so we didn't have a chance to fight back. They were a lot bigger than us. We, the jury, in the above entitled action, find the defendant... Judy Johnson and the child, who was two and a half years old, had said that Raymond Buckey had molested him. The Manhattan Beach Police Department sent out a letter to all the parents at the McMartin Preschool. The letter talked about Ray Buckey. You know, I was just in shock. My job is to get to hear yucky secrets. Kee McFarlane got the children to talk. We are alleging that approximately 100 children were sexually molested at the school over the past 10 years. Bail was set at fifty thousand to a million dollars for seven preschool teachers accused of molesting children. Three hundred and fifty children that we saw described being sexually abused. Manhattan Beach Police Department. Kee McFarlane who's an expert in child abuse matters thought her technique should be videotaped. And what we discovered, these children were not telling the same story during each interview. When the child said, "No" referring to Ray, "he wasn't even there when I went there," they'd say, "Well, how about your sister, your brother?" And they'd have their names and they'd work on maybe it happened to your brother and your sister, maybe you don't know. Confronting these children with sexually explicit dolls. They were three and four when they were in preschool. Their memories weren't accurate. If you watch the videos, you'll see they didn't know who their fellow classmates were. But then when they were asked about supposed games played at the school, well, they remembered, goose‐goose, ducky‐duck. But that's not what Kee wanted to hear about, she wanted to hear about yucky games. Games where the kids were supposedly nude. "No, we didn't play any yucky games." The interviewer, typically Kee, would say, "Well, you remember Suzie and Jimmy, your friends? They told us you all played these naked games. Aren't you as smart as they are?" What do you expect the child to say? "No, I'm dumber than them"? When I saw some of the tapes, I said, "That's it? That's what they did? Are you kidding me?" Experts began to look at them. And the experts said, "These leading questions in this context is not wrong, it's almost criminal." The first time I went to look at the tapes, I was blown away. When you evaluate, uh, little children, your goal is to get a spontaneous report from the child. These were not spontaneous interviews. They were scripted. Each child had a series of questions to be asked, and they would answer that. And then we looked at the scripts, they're all the same. The kids would say no, we didn't do that. And then they'd keep plodding on with the rest of the questions. The interviewers of the children clearly had an agenda so that it really wasn't a search for truth. When I evaluated those tapes, I never saw any spontaneous comment from a child that something untoward happened. In fact, some of them could even identify the major suspect, Ray Buckey. If you wanna convict somebody, don't videotape it, keep secret how many times it took you to get them to say the right words that you can write down and report. ...no, because he had pointy thing. You're talking to a three‐year‐old, you have to lead them. They‐‐ they're not gonna just say, "Oh, I was molested. And we had to do this and we had to do that." My daughter doesn't just tell me what happened at school when I ask her what happened at school today. I have to kind of prod her and encourage her. It's not easy to interview a three‐year‐old and expect them to be able to just spit out what happened. So, you have to lead them when you ask them questions. You know, I‐‐ from my perspective, it happened. It's a no‐brainer. I know I was molested. The first prosecutor on the case called Kee MacFarlane essentially the savior of the children. This highly regarded, respected therapist. Anything she said was taken as gospel. It turns out Kee MacFarlane wasn't an expert at all. She had a bachelor's degree in sociology. She had no certifications or licenses. She was clearly not a therapist. I interviewed Kee MacFarlane and she talked about the fact that she's not a police investigator. And she wasn't the expert on whether this was evidence of a crime. That is the responsibility of the DA's office. And she's correct in that. It was really the responsibility of the DA's office to look at those tapes and say, "Is there evidence of a crime here?" The referral to them to do the investigation was dead wrong. I don't know why the police or why the DA agreed to that. It never made any sense. In a typical sex case, you get interviews conducted by professional investigators. If you're gonna bring 60 felony charges against somebody, you better have a good, solid case, you better spend the time. They didn't do that. It was hard for us as lawyers to sit there and watch the prosecution stand up and argue these points about this evidence. It was ridiculous. But they're following orders. We've asked the DAs against us in court, "Have you seen these tapes?" You would think that if they would've looked at those, they'd stand up and say, "No. We‐‐ we didn't realize we had these issues, these problems. It's called no case." They had accepted Kee's explanation and version but they never reviewed the videotapes. When these games were going on, how many children were present when the naked games were going on? Uh, you're asking me about something that, um, has not yet been testified to. And so, according to the court's order, it's not appropriate for me to say that. Thank you. I don't know if Lael Rubin ever went, "Oh, my gosh. I should've at least looked at the tapes before Philibosian threw his hat in the ring prematurely on this case." Something very unusual occurred during the course of the hearing. There at counsel table was the incumbent district attorney sitting closest to the jury box. And in the jury box were the cameras. And as they'd sweep down the counsel table, the first person you would see was the incumbent district attorney. That was free publicity that would be worth millions in a campaign. I plainly asked, "Why is he here?" Mr. Philibosian acted as district attorney while running for a campaign using this case to gain greater name identity. It's absolutely not true at all. Mr. Philibosian has not in any way put any pressure on us. After the court sessions, went into the hallway where he was surrounded by television cameras, and held forth. This was a great opportunity for Robert Philibosian to take advantage of the media and hook his name on that star. Mr. Philibosian has not in any way put any pressure on us. This was a great opportunity for Robert Philibosian to hook his name on that star. That was free publicity that would be worth millions. It turns out, it didn't help his campaign sufficiently. Preliminary hearing is designed, in a serious felony case, to show enough evidence that there was a crime. How do you feel about it? Would any reasonable man think he did it? A very light standard. There are attorneys that are called obstructionists. They try to obstruct the process, slow it down, make it difficult, um, and I think Danny enjoyed doing that. The preliminary hearing and the length that it took is almost entirely my responsibility and fault. My study back to 16th‐century Europe of social contagion taught me that once you have a scandal, let's call it molestation, and it conflicts dramatically with people in that community, they will inevitably, in that contagion, grab, enslave, and kill a scapegoat. My plan was to take the scandal and the scapegoat and spread the time. A long time passes and then we all look back with shameful retrospect what we did to those poor people. That's why we had a very, very long preliminary hearing. The longest in the history of American jurisprudence. Ray Buckey is charged with 97 counts of child molestation in the McMartin Preschool case. Prosecutors need the children to testify against him but there's a problem. CII's Kee MacFarlane claims that some children fear Buckey will kill them if they show up in court. As an overall best statement, I would say they're terrified. It was a sense urged by the district attorney and favored by the preliminary‐hearing judge to create what was known as a kiddie comfort setting. The children were so afraid of the teachers, it was alleged, they wouldn't be able to testify in the courtroom. It's always difficult for children to testify in court. That's a very frightening process. We actually build the courtroom to intimidate people so they follow the rules that the judge lays down. It's very difficult to be a witness anyway. And if you're the alleged victim in the case, it's even harder. It's putting your child through an abusive situation all over again. And as far as I'm concerned, you know, once was more than enough. There was talk about having the kids, I think, have their testimony videotaped and then they're gonna have the kids in a different room from the defense attorneys. Closed‐circuit television should not be used in any criminal trial. The Constitution requires, in a criminal case, the right to cross‐examine, in person, the accuser. When you have someone in the room like we are right now, you look at me, you look at my body movements, my body language, so to speak, that's what you see in a witness. When you have someone on a television screen, you‐‐ you miss all that. Eventually, when we were allowed to have live witnesses, I think children were freely able to testify. You're sitting in a big chair with a bunch of adults talking about sex and your feet don't even touch the ground, and, uh, half the time, they probably didn't understand what was going on. It was horrendous. Today, we have grown women who were abused as adult women who never told anyone because they didn't wanna have to tell their story. And to have a child have to do it over, and over, and over, I mean, just kind of puts things in perspective. What are we expecting from these kids? Those children had no protection once they were witnesses in the case and they testified in front of him, they stood there and pointed at Ray Buckey and said, "He's the guy that did this to me." Which I give them a lot of credit for. One little boy was having to tell about oral sex with Ray Buckey and defense attorney said, "Well, what color was his belt buckle?" From the beginning, the allegations heard in court have been horrific. The first child to testify, a seven‐year‐old boy told of being sodomized and forced to play naked games. At the preliminary hearing, I believe, uh, there were 10 children were asked by the prosecutor about the supposed naked movie star game. My memory of the naked movie star game now is just us the kids being naked on a stage and them taking pictures of us. I remember there being more than one teacher or adults and I remember there being multiple kids. One of them let out that, "I don't remember that at all. Never heard of it, never played it, never saw it." The other nine knew about it. But not one of the nine played it the same way the other eight did. Well, if this game was played, why wouldn't they all describe it the same? To try to remember specific events that were happening when we were so little, it's not really realistic. A lawyer led the seven‐year‐old boy to admit the therapist had suggested his allegations to him. "You're telling the story everybody who talks to you about this case wants you to tell, right?" The lawyer asks. "Yes," said the boy. It's easy to discredit stories from a five‐year‐old. And those defense attorneys, they were bastards. They just‐‐they ate the kids up and spit them out. About this point, one of the prosecutors, Glenn Stevens, viewed the CII videotapes from start to finish. And he's thinking, "They're in a world of hurt," because the kids, and to use his word, are confabulating. Taking pieces of stories and stringing them together. I believe that, uh, the evidence is very flawed, whether or not they're factually innocent is something that is always going to be open to speculation. I doubt that anything ever happened at the school, based on the evidence that I've seen. What we're left with at this point is that for five of the seven defendants in the McMartin case, the evidence is so slim that it does not go beyond, uh, the mere accusation. Come on, Babie. Excuse us folks, please. How does it feel to be out? Oh, I haven't had a chance to tell. I think Ira Reiner's chicken. Right. The message that's being sent to child molesters is that if there are‐‐ if there are children that are two, three, four, or five years old, that there's absolutely no reprisals that will be brought against those pedophiles or child molesters. Those kids are fair game. These were upstanding women in the community. All of them lost everything they had for no reason. It's all so horrible, and so frightening, and so degrading, and‐‐ and insulting. Two years out of my life has been taken from me, time I should be spending with my husband, with my children and my grandchildren. I can't get the years lost that I lost with my kids. There were two years that were completely taken away and I can never get them back. They did nothing wrong, the system decided to toy with them for a while and then spit them out once they're done. Here I sit with a cloud over my head. They haven't said I'm innocent. Their lives were ruined. They weren't acquitted. They just had charges dismissed. I can't explain why the charges weren't dropped against all seven because it was the same evidence that was considered insufficient to take five to trial was being relied on to take the other two to trial. For five of the seven defendants in the McMartin case, the evidence is so slim that it does not go beyond the mere accusation. There were two years that were completely taken away and I can never get them back. I was actually next door to the case during the preliminary hearing. And with all the publicity that followed this case, I realized that, uh, it would be a very difficult trial for a judge. So when I got the case, it was like going to war and saying, "I'm not gonna live through this, so I'm gonna do my very best all the way through it." The charges in this case contains 100 felony counts, 99 counts of lewd and lascivious acts against children under the age of 14. Manhattan Beach Police Department. My name is Judy Johnson and I wanna report a crime. Judy Johnson was the first person who had reported any kind of problem at the McMartin Preschool. Judy Johnson was suspected of being an alcoholic. I had my investigator spend time with her and he came back, and told me what she talks about from moment to moment makes no sense. She never became a real part of my defense because I didn't know she had, you know, perhaps schizophrenia and, uh, drinking problems because they hid it. So the idea came about and I generated as much as I can, I think we need to see this witness. She called me the day before she was to testify saying she did not want to come into court. Uh, I had tried to assure her we would protect her, we would make sure she was comfortable. Uh, I tried to do everything I could because we needed to have her come in. And that night, she drank herself to death. I never understood why Manhattan Beach Police Department didn't deeply investigate her. Okay. It was‐‐ it was not done. Had it been done then, I wouldn't be talking about the case. It would never have been filed. At its bare bones, the case rested on the medical evidence, the children's interviews, and Raymond Buckey's confession to a jailhouse informant. George Freeman was a informant brought by Lael Rubin to say to the jury, "Ray Buckey told me he did it all in spades and more." It's been going on for a long time. Did he say how long? Since he was about 14. They've been doing kids since he was 14? They've been doing movies. Kiddie porn? "And I'm not doing this because I want a break of any kind, I'm doing this because molestation bothers me and this guy should be punished for what he told me he did." The jury have to look at the fact that, uh, he has very strong and damaging information and testimony against Raymond Buckey. Actually, there ended up being a grand jury investigation as a consequence of this case of the DA and the sheriff's cooperating to put snitches in cells with suspects who they're having trouble getting evidence from. They would show that informant police reports, details of which were unique to that case, so with that signature information, sheriff's deputies would put them in a cell with a high‐publicity defendant, like my client, and make up a confession, and then Lael would call them and get her conviction. He confessed. He showed up in court for one day and on the second day, he just disappeared. They found him at a house. They had to break down the door, bring him in. The prosecutor said, "You know, we would like to recess to give Mr. Freeman a chance to clean up." This guy had his hair back, he had a rack of menacing tattoos on his arms, shackled with sheriff's deputies standing next to him. He, um, did not look the greatest, but I was not gonna take time out of the trial for him to be cleaned up and brought in. The fact that he was, uh, difficult, obstreperous, and had to be granted immunity was enough for the jurors to understand what kind of a person he was. Davis' cross‐examination was uncharacteristically short but it was pretty much, you know, "Mr. Freeman, you have no credibility whatsoever." And‐‐ and Freeman said, "No, I have no credibility." I think what happened was, uh, Lael Rubin has just used her last informant, only he ran out of informant gas. So that‐‐ that's leg number one of the prosecution's case. It was so much easier to never take a picture and just say, "I saw all this damage," right? That's why I started doing photo documentation. Because I wanted to be held accountable. I wanted it to be science. I wanted it to be right. Dr. Heger, she was a very compelling witness. She introduced this practice, referred to as colposcopic slides, which is basically photographing the genitalia of the children who were allegedly abused. And these slides were shown in court and she identified on the slides scars, which, you know, if you look at the palm on your hand, it'd be sort of like a little scar down the palm of your hand. And she said, "That's blunt force trauma." Prosecution put on two more medical doctors who concurred with Dr. Heger's assessment. But the defense attorneys, Danny Davis and Dean Gits, asked Dr. Heger to identify the area of trauma. She points with the little pointer and they put a little circle around the area on the slide that's blunt force trauma. And then when the other two doctors testified, none of them lined up. The three doctors could not agree what on the slides indicated blunt force trauma. The science of child abuse and child sex abuse, particularly, was in a very embryonic stage at that point. But I do think that not only was there evidence that in following these kids later when they went through puberty, uh, and had some problems, that the medical diagnosis was‐‐ was valid. Manhattan Beach Police Department. We, the jury, in the above entitled action find the very defendants not guilty It was devastating. You're speechless. How‐‐ how could that happen? I was just‐‐ I just couldn't believe it when they said "not guilty." It just was such a shock to hear that‐‐ that they were gonna go free and... terrified. I couldn't understand, as a kid, how they could not believe us. How they could think he was innocent. And as a kid, not guilty felt like innocent. To be honest with you, I don't see the legal system as determining whether something happened or not. And we all know some very famous cases in this country where we're all pretty convinced that the, uh, accused was guilty, and they were found not guilty. It's possible that these children were molested, and it may not have been proven that‐‐ that the defendants were the cause or if someone else was. Whether I believe he did it and whether it was proven are‐‐ are very different. The parents have to live with this. And there's nothing that I can say or anyone else can say to make them feel better. We did the best job we could do with the information that was given to us. One child sat on the stand for 15 days being wracked and abused by a defense attorney. And what did he get? Not guilty. So why should you tell? We the jury in the above entitled action, find the very defendants not guilty I couldn't understand, as a kid, how they could not believe us. After the trial, people are split and there's people marching, and they're protesting based on what? There were no evidence. We will not take no for an answer. And, uh, even though we may not be getting answers tonight from the district attorney's office, we will be looking for them in the future. To tell you how crazy it could get, a group of parents hired a tunnel expert. Because the kids had talked about there being tunnels under the vacant lot that was next to the preschool. I wanted to get someone who knew what to look for. So the first thing I did was I went and got a archaeologist. I consider myself an objective scientist and I use scientific method. The children said that they were taken into a tunnel underneath the school, and into a room, and there is where they were molested as part of what came out to be satanic rituals. And so, my job was to see if I could find any objective evidence of any of that. When you're searching for a tunnel or an opening, where the tunnel is, the soil would be looser and usually a different color because of things mixed into the soil that would happen when they backfill, so to speak. There was, uh, bottles, there was cans, there was, I believe, cardboard, there was wood fragments, there's plastic. So there's a lot of trash and debris that was part of the fill. One of the things we found right away was a plastic bag sticking out of the disturbed area. It had a date on it, 1982‐83. The school had been built decades before, so the fact that there was something in there with that date on it was a good indicator that someone had been under the floor during that time. What was particularly notable to me and, uh, relevant to the cult aspect of this thing was when my crew dug down less than a foot. They found this plate. And when I saw the plate, you know, my blood ran cold because on it was this perfect pentagram. I could see that each arm of the pentagram was very precisely engraved. So obviously, it was done by an adult. And then we hatoto cut through the floors to excavate underneath the school structure. We did find the tunnel that went underneath the foundation between two of the rooms. And underneath about a two‐foot concrete foundation underneath the floor, they had carved out the bottom of the foundation, so it's actually slightly curved, which perfectly matched the width of the tunnel to facilitate walking through there. You know, as a scientist, I talk in probabilistic terms. You never talk in absolutes if you're a good scientist, you know? But probabilistically, yes, I found a tunnel and that backs up the children's, um, statements. It confirmed what we were looking for. A tunnel expert digs up the lot. Digs tunnels into the lot. Then there's press out there. And he's talking as if these tunnels were there. Uh, actually, I remember picking up the LA Times and the headline says something like, "Tunnel expert examines McMartin Preschool site." I mean, anyone looking at that story thinks, "Oh, my God. There's tunnels at the McMartin preschool." I mean, what else would you think? But he just dug the tunnels. There wasn't anything there. Manhattan Beach Police Department. This is much too important a case, far too much has gone into it, for far too long, and the charges are much too serious to allow it to hang out there with such a great question mark. Reiner is a political machine and he wasn't gonna back down. And he sends them to trial a second time. With no new evidence. He was gonna try with the same evidence that failed, and failed miserably. Go a second time, so he can be attorney general? That decision debases anything we've learned what happened to these children. That's when I started saying, "I will end Ira Reiner's career." Ira Reiner decided to retry the case. I agreed to do it because I figured, "What have we got to lose?" I mean, the case is already a mess. All we can do is make it better. Plus, I went to McMartin. So it was my old‐‐ my old preschool. We've looked at the evidence very carefully. And we are firmly convinced that the children were indeed molested. I went to my client and I said, "I'm gonna get them engaged in a plea bargain discussion. But we're not gonna take anything. Not even disturbing the peace or speeding. Nothing." Before the trial started, Danny Davis walked up to me in the courtroom and said, "Uh, let's try to settle this case." I thought, "Yippee." Ray Buckey, you know, he'd already done four or five years in jail. I figure we could plead him for a couple of counts of child molest and give him time served, at least we'd have a conviction. But we found out later Danny Davis had secretly tape‐recorded us. A well‐known political journalist confronted Reiner. "Well, isn't it true that your office offered a plea bargain to Ray Buckey?" "We'd never offer him anything. That guy is guilty. We're gonna put him away. The children will be vindicated." "Well, we understand that the entire thing was tape‐recorded." The press came and said, "Hey, we heard you had a plea bargain talk." And I couldn't say "no comment" 'cause that's the same as saying yes. Danny Davis, being the idiot that he was, he didn't understand. We weren't lying about it for any other reason than to protect his client's presumption of innocence. But no good deed goes unpunished. Reiner panicked. And his response later on to the media was, "Well, we never formally made an offer." And my answer was, "Well, it wasn't a formal offer, but I was in a coat and tie. Can we call it a semiformal offer?" And I never heard from Reiner after that. I don't think anybody else did. My feelings about Mr. Davis are on the verge of homicidal. My main focus going in was to finish the case with some shred of dignity left. We took it down to the bare minimum and put on basically three victims, three mothers, and a couple experts. So many years had passed since the incident by then. And so much had come to bear on these children. There was so much publicity. There was so much parental and society pressure that the kids had been all turned around. It was an impossible task. I felt very much, like, um, I was on a suicide mission. I'm ready. I've been ready for five years. I'm ready for it to end. Danny Davis wanted me to shake Ray Buckey's hand the first day. And I thought, "I know where that hand has been. I'm not shaking it." ‐Mainly reserved‐‐ ‐PAMELA: I cross‐examined Ray Buckey for three days. The first question I asked was, "Why do you like children?" And he said, "Because they're so honest." In retrospect, I probably should have just sat down and said, "I'm done." That to me was him telling everybody, "I did it." That was Ray Buckey's admission that the kids who testified against it were telling the truth. It turns out that some of the stuff that had happened before could have helped us win the case because it's a high‐profile case. I knew that if the jurors were watching TV and heard that Ray Buckey had had a conversation about a plea deal, they're gonna assume he's guilty. And we could end up being able to convict him. My main focus going to the second trial was to finish the case with some shred of dignity left. We took it down to the bare minimum and put on basically three victims, three mothers, and a couple experts. But it was an impossible task. I felt very much, like, um, I was on a suicide mission. This is a case where the kids are either believed or not. And we hung the jury again, of which I consider to be a small victory because we knew we couldn't win. It wasn't realistic. It was clear to me that the, uh, jury will not reach a verdict in this case on any of the, uh, counts. Therefore, there is a legal necessity to declare a mistrial. I understood why they wanted it retried. But it should not have been retried. It was just a mess. The case was a mess. I've learned to endure a lot of things in my life for seven years. I'll just go on just like everybody else does when they have a hardship, they get through it. I'm sure there'll be some adjustment, but basically, I have to get a real job now. We, the jury, in the above entitled action, find the very defendants not guilty I think it had to be devastating to the children‐‐ I mean, here, they went through all of this and they told the truth and nobody believed them. And these people got off. We were so sure of ourselves. It's really hard, you know, just to accept the fact that we weren't able to prove in a court of law our point. There was so much publicity. There was so much parental and society pressure. The public's perception, the commentary, the cameras, it was impossible for them not to be known in their communities. And so much had come to bear on these children. It was relentless. They became McMartin victims. I mean, that was their whole identity. It's‐‐ it's so awful. The thing that bothered me the most is that it felt to me that the kids were expendable. As long as we got their testimony, that was enough. We as adults, in this case, should have done a lot more to protect them. They're the heroes. They bore the weight of it. And they went, took the stand, those little kids, and made it easier for every other child who ever has to come forward forever. I know something horrible happened there. I know things happened there that were so terrible, it kept my daughter awake at night. It was horrific. I know some kids who had a really terrible time because of what happened. My daughter's still in therapy. She's 37. I'm sure my son wasn't the only one that turned to alcohol. I'm sure there were other children. My son is three. And I was younger than him when this stuff was happening. So... we didn't have a chance to fight back. They were a lot bigger than us. I'm sorry I sent him to that school. ‐WOMAN: Hi, Ray. ‐RAY: Hi. Ray Buckey took away my childhood. He took away my trust in other people. I never doubted anything either my children said about what happened to them at the preschool. I have absolutely no doubt that Ray Buckey molested those kids. I will go to my grave thinking it and... I hope there's a special place in hell for him. There are so many people hurt. I mean, families that are involved. Their lives are just destroyed. They take your trust and they suck you in. And then they take your most prized possession and try to dement it. If you're a McMartin parent now, you have to accept not being able to know certain things. A lot of people may feel, "Well, they couldn't prove the case. You know, maybe next time we'll get them." We hear that a lot in criminal law. In this case, there was no case. Factually innocent is different than being dismissed or acquitted. Factually innocent means just that, they didn't do anything wrong with those children. This is a system out of control, who damaged this family for no reason. Just‐‐ it's a shame. It's a real shame. Well, the only thing I can say to all of you is if it could happen to seven innocent people, it can happen to any of you. And if it had not been for my faith in God, I would not be here today. It was a disaster for everyone. The parents of the children suffered. I can imagine the children suffered. The defendants suffered. These are substantially decent people and there they are in jail. They lost the school. They lost their homes. They lost their reputations. It was a witch hunt and there are no witches. Really, there are no witches. McMartin is like learning a life's lesson you never want your child to learn. I‐‐ I think it's akin to having a puppy that gets run over on the street in front of your house and then having your children go look at it so they know what life's about.
