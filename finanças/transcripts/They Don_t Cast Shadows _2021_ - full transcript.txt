(droning string music) (frogs croaking) (insects chirping) (Haures and Jael laughing) - [Haures] You ready to take your last breath, girl? (Jael laughing) - [Jael] Two days and your dead! (Haures cackling) - Leave me alone! (Jael cackling) - Oh. why don't you pray? (Haures and Jael cackling) - [Jael] Nothing can save you now! - Stop! (soft orchestral music) (knife chopping) (horse snorts) - [Victoria] I wish we could just get rid of her. - [Travis] The time will come. - [Victoria] I'm counting down the days. (slams knife) Just looking at her makes me sick! (horse snorts) (Lisa chuckles) (gentle orchestral music) - Mom, this is delicious. Thank you. - You're lucky we even invited you to dinner. (soft string music) - We have five new mares booked to Cats on Fire. - I told you it'd be a profitable stallion. - I'll say. At five grand a pop, we'll make our money back and then someone on his first crop alone. - May I please be excused? - Yes. No! - The table isn't going to clean itself. (somber string music) (chatter on TV) - May I please be excused to my room? - Go. You need all the beauty rest you can get. (chatter on TV) (soft string music) - Only four more days till summer vacation. We'll have the whole summer to ride. (Lisa chuckles) What would I do without you? Ooh, I gotta go. Have a good day, Lucky. (bus rumbling) (Lisa sighs) Great. (engine revs) (Lisa falls) (children laughing) - You all right? He literally does that every time he stops. I don't know why he doesn't wait until everyone's safely seated. (bright string music) I think that's everything. There you are. (chuckles) - Thank you. - Yeah. - Lisa! I totally have some exciting news. - Me too! - Okay. You go first. - I dropped my books on the bus this morning. - That doesn't really sound too exciting. (laughs) - Let me finish! This really cute guy helped me pick them up. - Okay, tell me more. What's his name? - I don't know. He was wearing a varsity jacket. - Okay, so he probably plays sports, he's a senior? Did you catch his name on his jacket? - No. - School's out Friday. He'll probably graduate, and I'll never see him again. - Okay, let's just hope he's a junior that's really awesome at sports. (chuckles) (students chattering) - Who are they making fun of now? Anyway, what is your news? - Oh, yeah. Um... Last night, something changed. I feel like I finally know Jesus. - Jesus? - Jesus Christ, the savior of the world? (chuckles) Really, Lisa? - Oh, sorry. Um... Congratulations? I mean, what does that really mean? - That I received Jesus into my heart. - Into your heart? - Yeah, my Sunday school teacher and I had this really long talk, and I was telling her how I didn't really get the whole Jesus thing, and she said that's because I didn't get my gift. - Gift? Well, if it's that cute boy from the bus, I'll take it. - Lisa. I'm serious. I want you to come with me to youth group tomorrow night. - I don't know. (soft string music) I'd rather ride Lucky. - It'll be fun. I promise. - I don't know. - Okay. Just promise me you'll think about it. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. - I'll think about it. - Okay. (both giggling) (riding boot zips) - Here's your list of chores. (uneasy string music) - I'll never have time to ride lucky. - [Mom] That's your problem. (shoulder bumps) (window cleaning) (brush scrubbing) (shovel digging) - I'm sorry that I couldn't go on a ride today. (horse snorts) (saddle slams) (emotional string music) (crickets chirping) (horse snorts) (Lisa chuckles) (ominous string music) (fountain gurgling) (distorted speech) (window creaks) (distorted speech) - That sounds really scary. You know, you have to be careful. Satan is real, and he can make people do horrible things. And you're sure it wasn't a dream? - I don't know. Maybe I did dream it. I mean, I was half asleep when I walked into the house. I don't really know what I saw. - So I guess that means you didn't think about it. - What? - Youth group? Please come with me tonight. It'll be a lot of fun. - Tina... I don't know. Can we talk about it later? I have a lot on my mind. - Yeah. Call me before 6:00, and my parents and I will come pick you up, okay? - My parents have been listening in on my calls. It's really weird. I don't know how they'd feel about me going to church. I mean, we're not really religious. - You can just say that you wanna come and hang out at my house. They don't really have to know where we're going. (chuckles) And we drive right by your house on the way to church anyway, so. (somber orchestral music) - Where is Lucky? Where is lucky? - [Mom] Gone. - What do you mean gone? - [Mom] He's no longer here. We sold him. - Sold him... To who? Why would you do that? Where is dad? Where is Lucky? - Calm down. - Calm down? You really expect me to be calm? Where is my horse? - We had to sell him to make room for the new stallions. - [Lisa] Sell him to who? - [Dad] I don't know exactly who! Ask your mother. - How could you do this to me? (door slams) (phone dialing) - Lisa? - Tina? - [Tina] Are you okay? What's wrong? - My parents sold Lucky. - [Tina] How could they? They know how much you love your horse. - Something isn't right. Can you... Can you please come get me? - [Tina] Yeah, sure. We'll be right over. - I'll meet you by the gate. - [Tina] Okay. See you in a few. (anxious string music) - Thank you for picking me up. - I'm just glad you called. - You're always welcome, sweetie. - We love having you around. ♪ This little light of mine ♪ ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ ♪ This little light of mine ♪ ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ ♪ This little light of mine ♪ ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ ♪ Let it shine let it shine let it shine ♪ (somber orchestral music) - Tina! - Hi! This is my best friend, Lisa. - Hi, Lisa. My name's Sunshine. - I'm Eddie. - Hey, I know you. I'm Jason. - Lisa. (chuckles awkwardly) - Yeah. Are your knees all right from the bus? - Oh, yeah. It's more my wrist actually. - Honestly, you totally pulled it off. It looked pretty cool. (chuckles) - Really? - Yeah. (both laughing) - I didn't see you on the bus this morning. - Yeah, yeah. Normally I don't take the bus. My dad usually drops me off on his way to work. Anyways, welcome to youth group. Yeah. - Are you okay? (chuckling) - That's the boy from the bus. - Jason? - Yeah! - Please take a seat so we can get this thing started. All right, let's pray. (Jason exhales) Lord, give me the right words to say. Open hearts, ears, and minds. And in Jesus name, amen. Okay, so, last week we left off on Satan. Satan comes in many different forms and can cause people to do things that they normally wouldn't do. His main goal is to take as many humans as possible with him to eternal punishment in hell. But he can only do that by preventing us from knowing and believing in God's plan of redemption. When we see later on in Peter 1, we can actually notice that... Yeah, uh, yeah, Lisa. - What do you mean "redemption"? - Oh, okay. Yeah. God, right, in his infinite love and wisdom, sent his son, Jesus Christ, to earth to live a perfect and sinless life. And Jesus then died on the cross for our sins. And three days later, he rose from the dead. If you believe that in your heart and confess that with your lips, then you'll be redeemed. - How do I do that? - You just have to pray. - Ask the Lord to come into your heart. (soft string music) - And believe that He died for your sins and rose again. - Do you believe that, Lisa? - Let's do it. (chuckles) Thank you so much, Lord, for bringing Lisa in today. Lisa trusts and believes that you are her savior. Holy Spirit, we feel your presence in this room right now. Love her and protect her. Guide her with whatever gifts you bestow upon her, Lord. Fill her up, Jesus. And in Jesus' mighty name, amen! - [All] Amen. (group clapping) - Congratulations. (Lisa laughs) - Thank you. - All right. This is for you. (gentle orchestral music) - Thank you. - Yeah, no problem. We have an afterschool Bible study, and you should come. (group chattering and laughing) - What's the matter, Lisa? - You don't... You don't see them? They're right there in the middle of the parking lot! - See whom? - She can see us. - Perhaps that's her special gift. Let us depart quickly so we can report this. - They're... They're gone now. - Who's gone? - I didn't see anyone. - How could you miss them? - What did they look like? - They were both really tall. They had glowing white eyes. - Okay. Um... Well, anything else unusual happens, just let us know. I'll be on the bus tomorrow, so I'll see you then. See you guys later. (brooding string music) - Oh, Mom, you will never guess what happened. - Did Lisa accept the Lord? - How did you know? - Just had a feeling. Congratulations, sweetie! And welcome to the family! - It was more than just that. Something weird happened. - Thank you, Mrs. Lynch. Did any of you see anything weird when you were saved? (soft string music) - Your life's been changed, Lisa. You've been made anew. Things may seem different, but you can never go wrong trusting Jesus. - God is good. - All the time. - [Lynch Family] All the time, God is good. (chatter on TV) (unsettling string music) (books clatter) - Hey, Belial look at this. I think that girl can see us. - You're crazy, Zahvia. Humans can't see demons. - This one can. See how she follows my movements with her eyes? (Zahvia sniffing) - Hey, I think you're right. - [Zahvia] Possess her! - Now it's your turn. (disturbing noises) (steam hissing) - [Zahvia] Belial? Oh! (water pouring) - What's this? (tense string music) - It's a Bible. - A Bible? You disgust me! I never want to see this book again! - [Lisa] I'll be a little late coming home. - And don't forget to muck the stalls! - Lazy girl. - I was thinking about you last night. - You were? - About your gift. - Oh. - Did anything else happen after we saw you last night? - Yeah, my parents are demon-possessed. (Jason chuckles) - You're serious. Okay. Cool, cool. - I think one of them tried to possess me, too. When it touched me, it screamed as if I burnt it. - Okay, well, the good news is, once you're saved, you can't be possessed, so. I'll see you after school in the Room 305. - Yeah, I wouldn't miss- (unsettling instrumental music) - What's up? - The bus driver. - What about the bus driver? - His eyes. - Maybe writing things down would be helpful. (eerie whooshing) - So, the mystery is solved, huh? - What do you mean? - About Jason being the mysterious boy from the bus, silly. (laughs) - Three more. - Three more what? - Three more demon-possessed kids. - How do you know? - They have yellow eyes and they're... throwing these things at people's heads. - [Tina] Throwing things? - They look like marbles. - Are you feeling okay? - That's weird. - You're weird! Mr. Jenkins, Mr. Howard, Mr. Rotagari, and... six students. Also, I saw demons in the hallway throwing flaming marbles at people's heads. - Lisa, I've been given this a lot of thought and I just... (tense instrumental music) Lisa. Lisa. - They're here. - Who? - Have no fear, Lisa. - I think they're friendly. - Fear not. We mean you no harm. We are angels of the Lord of Hosts. My name is Vaniah and this is Tirsah. - What is happening to me? Why am I the only one who can see and hear you? People are starting to think I'm crazy. - You have been given a special gift, for you are the key to reclaiming Cloverville. - Reclaiming Cloverville? From what? - I think you already know from what. - Jason has been called to full-time service by the Lord of Hosts. If you two put your heads together, I'm sure you can figure out what to do. - Now go back to your friends and let us observe. (brooding string music) - Lisa, what just happened? Who are you talking to? - Angels. They want to be left alone. - What did they say to you? - That I've been given a special gift of seeing angels and demons... to reclaim Cloverville. - Reclaim it from what? - They said that you've been called to full-time service by the Lord of Hosts, and we could figure it out ourselves. - Called? No one knows about that. Only Pastor Emery knows about that. - I don't even know what "called" means. - It means I feel like God has asked me to become a pastor. - A pastor? - Yeah. - He's gonna be celibate. - Uh, pastors can't get married, can they? - Oh, she's on a roll now. - Hey! I thought you were supposed to just observe. - Sorry, sorry. Couldn't help myself. - I'm outta here. This is way too weird for me. Dude, this is like a freak show or something. - [Female Student] Me too. I'm going with you guys. (emotional string music) - Are you guys gonna leave? - I'm staying with you. - Look, Jason... are you sure about this? - Yeah. Lisa, there's actually a precedent in the Bible for your gift, it's in 2 Kings. - You don't think I'm crazy? - Well, to be honest, yeah, I did a little, but once you mentioned I was called, no. Here. It talks about an army of thousands surrounding the city of Dothan and ready to slay the Prophet Elijah. Elijah's servant was scared, but they told him not to worry, because there was this invisible warrior army that was way stronger than the enemy. My point is that the servant, even though he had human eyes, could see this invisible angel army. My opinion, if I'm allowed to have one, is that whatever you're seeing in this room are angels, and the ones with the yellow eyes are demons, and the marbles are just like the fiery darts that are in the Book of Ephesians. (anxious string music) - Looks like we're on the right track. - There has been a lot of those new age stores opening up in town recently. I wonder if that means something. - You mean the ones with magic and the psychic bookstores? One of my friends was talking about some crystals that she got from there. - Actually, I've noticed some kids in my English class, they've been playing with tarot cards, and it's been kind of creeping me out. - Yeah, people have been acting differently since those stores popped up. - Maybe we should check it out. What's the most popular one? - The kids kept talking about the Life Force store and how it's the newest place in town to hang out. - We should start there. Maybe that will explain what's happening to me. - Okay. Lisa and I will visit the Light Force store on Saturday. And then, on Sunday, we'll let you guys know what's up. Keep us in your prayers. - Are you feeling okay? - I don't know. I'm kind of worried about going home. - You know, you can always ask God for protection. - How do I ask Him? (gentle string music) - Through prayer. (chuckles) Prayer is like a conversation with God. Basically, you talk to Him, and you wait and listen for His response. - Is that the same as when the angels speak to me? (giggles) - I mean, most of us don't really have angels talking to us, but yeah. God speaks to us when we're silent in prayer or when we read the Bible. Come on. Dear Lord Jesus, I just pray for Lisa's protection, that you'll always be with her, and that you'll be with her when she gets home. - Where have you been, Lisa? - I'm sorry. I told Mom I'd be late. - This is Mr. And Mrs. Newman. Mr. Newman is the Chairman of the Cloverville City Council. - It's nice to meet you, Lisa. - Nice to meet you both as well. (air whooshes) (ominous orchestral music) - Lisa, my hands are almost healed from last night. Want a rematch? - I thought you said she could hear us and see us! - She can! (Belial sniffing) - Mom, can I please have a piece of pie? - No! (slaps hand) You don't get dessert. You didn't eat dinner. - This is a waste of time. Look, boss, you gotta believe me. - No more false reports, Belial! Or you know what awaits you. - Tell him, Zahvia. You saw it first. - Perhaps you are mistaken. (Belial snarls) (air whooshes) (pounds table) (dishes clatter) - Bah! You are wasting my time. - Please excuse us. Mrs. Newman. And I must miss your delicious dessert. I have a meeting to attend to, and we must be going. - Businessman after my own heart. I'm sorry you have to go. I'll walk you out. - You'll never guess who came for dinner last night. - Satan? Probably not the best joke to make. Sorry. - Actually, it was four demon-possessed humans, and one of them was Mr. Newman. - The Chairman of the City Council? - You know him? - Yeah, my father's on the City Council. Hey. - Congratulations, sweetheart! - Thanks, Mama. Thanks. - We have a surprise for you! - What? Is this me? (Jason laughs excitedly) Wow! She... Wow. Thank you guys. This is... - Well, it was either this truck or the University of Oregon. But you gave that scholarship up. (keys jangling) - Thanks, Dad. - We are proud of you, honey. - Thanks so much. - Mwah! - All right. All right. You two wanna share my first ride with me? - I already rode over in it. You guys go ahead. - All right, come on. (chuckles) My lady. (Lisa laughs) (gentle string music) (engine starts) (air puffs) (Jason and Lisa laughing) Sunshine! She promised me! She promised me she would get me back after what we did at summer camp. Hey, you're the worst! You're the worst! (Lisa laughing) - That sounds like a story I need to hear. - Yeah, maybe after we clean all this up. This is perfect. (Lisa and Jason laughing) - There's a big dumpster in the back. We can toss out all this confetti. - That's exactly what I was thinking. (ominous instrumental music) (tires squeak) That looks like a body, right? - I think that's Mr. Newman's car. - Don't see Mr. Newman. - That's- - Put your head down! (tires screeching) - That was definitely his car. - Let's go see what they dumped in there. - Do you think we should be doing this? - What if there is someone in that rug? They need our help. - Let's hope there isn't. Wait! Jason... I'm scared. (siren blaring) (Lisa gasps) - God. That's disgusting. (siren blaring) - That's Principal Hodges! (somber string music) - Put your hands up. - Whoa, whoa, hey. - Get over there. Keep your hands up. - Can you put your gun down please? - What'd you put in that dumpster? - [Jason] I didn't put anything in the dumpster? Put your guns down, man. - We were just dumping out the confetti that was in the truck. (tense string music) - Cuff 'em. - Turn around. (handcuffs rattling) You've got a lot of explaining to do. - But we didn't do anything wrong. Ask Mr. Newman. It was his car we saw driving away! - [Cop] What did you say? Mr. Newman? He's one of the most respected men in this town. (tense string music) Read 'em their rights. - Let's go. - [Jason] Yo, I wanna make my phone call! All right, my father's on the City Council! - Later. - [Jason] We have a right to a phone call! - I said later! (Jason sighs) - This is ridiculous. All right. All right. Lisa, everything's gonna be all right. Once I make this phone call, my father's gonna bail us out. - This is all my fault! (somber string music) - How could you possibly think that? - I'm the one who suggested that we put the confetti into the dumpster! Now we're never going to get out of here! - Lisa, come on. All right, everything's gonna be fine. - I'm just glad that your girlfriend isn't- - Girlfriend? Did you say girlfriend? - Yeah, Sunshine. (Jason sighs) - People think that? No, okay, no, Sunshine is my sister. - Oh. - Yeah. - Thank God. I mean, she sounds like a very nice sister. - Yeah, yeah, she's nice. To be honest. I've never had like a real girlfriend. - I find that really hard to believe. - Why? - I mean you're... You're just... You're so... - [Jason] What? - Nothing. - Yeah, I guess like... trying to keep my grades up... and football... and church, of course... just kinda got too busy. Anyway, don't worry, seriously. My dad's gonna get us outta here. (air whooshes) - I'm not sure about that. (suspenseful instrumental music) - Lisa? - [Lisa] There's a demon in my room! - Shh. Hyrum. I figured that little worm, Belial, was telling the truth. He's too stupid to come up with a story like that. But I had to see for myself. - What do you want? - I wanted to get you alone so I could explain how things really are. You chancing upon that dumpster was, shall we say, a convenient opportunity for me to isolate you. - What do you want, Hyrum? - You have been given a special gift from the Nazarene. For what purpose I don't know. His ways are mysterious, even to us. I am, however, demanding that you do not use this gift in Cloverville ever again. - I didn't ask for this sight, and I have no control over what I see! - True. But you can stop telling people what you see. Lisa, what are the demons saying? - It wants me to stop telling people when I see them! - Silence! Haven't you understood a single word I've said? This is not a request. I am ordering you! Do not tell anyone what you see ever again! Or else. - Or else what? Belial already tried to possess me. Maybe you should ask him how that turned out. (Hyrum scoffs) - You do not know your Bible very well, human. Read the Book of Job. It is true we cannot possess you; however, we can make you wish you were dead. (tense string music) I'm about to give you a short lesson in the power you are up against. (Hyrum grunts) (Lisa shouts) - Jason, help! (Hyrum grunts) - Lisa, what's going on? (head slams wall) (Jason shouts) (Jason groans) (kicks thudding) (Lisa shouting) Come on! Show yourself! (thud) (Lisa groaning) - Lord Jesus, help us! - [Hyrum] Silence! (hand smacks) (Lisa shouts) - Oh, Jesus... (groans) (staggered speech) (body slams into wall) (Jason groaning) - This has been our stronghold for a century. And you will not take it away from us! (Hyrum shouts) (punch slams) (dramatic string music) - Lisa. Lisa. Awaken. (Lisa breathing heavily) - [Lisa] Vaniah? What took you so long? - The powers of evil blocked our entrance. - [Lisa] What about Jason? - He will recover. Nothing is broken. Lisa, I have to go. Remember, if you need me, pray. May the Spirit light your path. - You're released. Mr. Newman has vouched for you. It seems we don't have enough evidence to hold you. We'll bring your truck around front. - We need to get to the bottom of this or I won't be able to sleep. I think we should go to that Life Force store tonight. - Are you sure you're feeling up to it? - They're going to keep attacking us if we don't, and I don't know if I can handle that again. - We should talk with Pastor Emery first. I bet he's still at the church. He usually meets up with my dad on Friday nights. My shoulder's been killing me lately. (soft orchestral music) I'm gonna wash up. - Who is he? - Lisa, this is Nissan. - Hello, Nissan. (chuckles) - What is so funny? - Nissan's a car company. - Nissan is a very good name. - It is even one of the months on the Hebrew calendar. - I'm so sorry. - I'm the angel of this church. - What do you mean, angel of this church? - Well, every Christian church, town, city, and country for that matter, has an angel watching over it. - Well, the angel of Cloverville should be fired. (Tirsah sighs) Oh, I'm so sorry Tirsah! I had no idea. - We are limited by the empowerment that your prayers give the Lord of Hosts to act upon. - I shouldn't have said that. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. - Although I do care deeply about what is happening in my Cloverville, feelings were not hurt, little one. - And what are you responsible for, Vaniah? - You. - Oh. (chuckles) - Now go get cleaned up. You wouldn't wanna frighten the pastor and his guests. - We have known for a while now that something is very wrong here in Cloverville. - [Lisa] Wrong? - Well, (chuckles anxiously) evil, if I'm being candid. - The Chairman of the City Council probably has something to do with that. The head demon took over his body. - And that brings us to your special gift. Now, for some reason, God has seen fit to give you this new sight to help us reclaim Cloverville. - But how? Do you know what I'm supposed to do? - Unfortunately, I don't. We are, however, on your side, We'll do everything we can to help. - Before we were arrested, our plan was to go to the Life Force bookstore and see if we can figure anything out. - Good. Jason, you've been called to full-time ministry. This is, however I'm afraid, you're baptism by fire. Now, demons are territorial, and they will not give up Cloverville without a battle. - Pastor, if you wouldn't mind, I would like to be the point of contact for this... investigation. I would like Jason to report to me, and then I'll compile all the facts and give a report to you and William. - Oh, I think that's a reasonable request. Let's pray before you go. Lord, we ask that You cover Jason and Lisa with your protection. Guide them to where they need to be to do your work and your will, Father. Thank you for your faithfulness, your protection, and your provision. In Jesus' name, amen. (shoppers chattering) - People actually believe this stuff works? - Well, when people don't have Jesus in their lives, they'll try to fill that void with anything that sounds good to them. Satan is always ready to do whatever it takes to keep their eyes from the truth. (tense orchestral music) - I don't know why, but I have a feeling that whatever we're looking for is behind those doors. We need to find a way to get back there somehow. - Maybe a distraction? - Do you think you could knock over that book rack? That'll buy me time to get to the back room. - I could, yeah. But wouldn't that be wrong? You know, like, we're the good guys, right? - Well, then what would you suggest? - Pray. Dear Lord, please help us figure out a distraction in order for us to get to that back room. (muttered speech) (book rack topples) (shoppers chattering) - Hey, I think I found something. - What's that? - Meeting room A, lower. (indistinct) - [Jason] The library. - [Lisa] What? - It's it's only place in town that uses uppers and lowers for the room numbers. - Let's see how good your sleuth skills are. - Hello. I was wondering if I could show my girlfriend room A. She wants to host an equestrian night and wants to check the space out. - Upper or lower level? - [Jason] Probably lower. - Room A is over to the right. Unfortunately, it's still a mess from last night's meeting. Our janitor quit two days. - Ah, that's a stinker. Well, honestly, I don't think we'll care too much about the mess, ma'am. Thank you. - Girlfriend? (soft string music) - Did I say that? Oh, man, I'm sorry. (chuckles) Must have slipped. - Nothing to be sorry about. - She wasn't lying. - Why would they leave it a mess like this? - That's a good point. - This stuff looks confidential. - We should take everything, just in case. (ominous atmospheric music) (papers shuffling) - You didn't have to clean up the room! - [Jason] It's our civic duty. - [Librarian] It's nice to see young people taking responsibility. - Yep. Uh-huh. (phone dialing) - I need to speak to Mr. Newman. (engine shuts off) - [Lisa] Wow, your house is beautiful. (Jason sighs) - Yeah, it's just a house. My dad's a realtor. - I recognize some of these names from last night's council meeting. - What do these weird diagrams and words mean? - Mindless doodling. - Why were you meeting up at the library in the middle of the night and not the City Council chambers? - That's city business. And all of these papers were supposed to have been cleaned up. Anyways, I don't see anything remotely sinister here. - Maybe we need to show Pastor Emery these papers. I mean, those words gotta mean something. - It's gibberish. You're grasping at straws, son. Now, I have to get back to work. (anxious atmospheric music) (phone dialing) Hi. It's me. We need to talk. (crickets chirping) (vehicle approaching) - You can stop here. - You want me to drive you up to your house? - Could we just sit here for a minute? - Yeah. Yeah, totally. (Lisa sighs) Can I tell you a secret? - Sure. - The other day on the bus. I'm... I'm really happy you dropped your books. I just... felt this like... this total attraction to you. - I thought it was really sweet that you helped me. And to be honest, I felt this attraction to you too. (gentle orchestral music) (both chuckling) - Someone broke into my office. - [Jason] Who would do that? - They didn't even take the laptop. - Should I call the cops? - No. Everything seems to be here. Except for that bag of papers from the library. - I bet Mr. Newman sent his men. (anxious atmospheric music) - So. How was your date? - I mean, if you wanna call it that. - I think you two make a cute couple. - Yeah. Thanks. - [Mom] Jason! Jason! Can you take out the trash? - Okay, Mom! Oh, man, I guess you'll just never know. That sucks. - Give me some details! - It was... more than okay. (crickets chirping) (Jason whistling) (papers rustling) (mysterious instrumental music) - Jason? - Sorry for bothering you this late, Pastor, at your home, but I think this is important. And for some reason my dad said that the papers were stolen, but they were just in the trash. Pretty weird, right? And when I asked him earlier if I could come here, he said no. You see anything of meaning over there? - Well, the papers that you found have mostly to do with a new construction project in Cloverville, but these two seem out of place. - [Jason] What do you mean? - Well, one is a diagram, and the other one is a list, both with Hebrew and Latin words on it. (mysterious instrumental music) - Why do you think my father's trying to hide these papers? - I don't know. I'll ask him tomorrow. Anyway, it's getting late. Why don't you go home? I'll tackle this later. - Okay. Thank you. Goodnight. (anxious instrumental music) - Why did you throw away the papers that Jason and Lisa found? - Jason gave those to you? - What are you hiding? - Nothing sinister. I assure you. - Go on. (Jonas sighs) - Those documents contain details of a new city project. Ol' Newby said it'd be better if the project didn't come to light just yet, so he advised me to tell Jason they were stolen so he would forget about them. - Why would he say that? - What I'm about to tell you must not leave this office until it is made public. Agreed? (Jonas sighs) As you know, the library has been in disrepair for years. Hardly anyone ever checks out books and almost all the research is done online these days. So we wanna turn the library into a hotel. - This plan will have opposition. - That's the reason for the secrecy. We don't want word of this getting out until all the options can be worked through. - Well, I think we know now what happened. Your secret is safe with us. Let the kids in. - All right, all these papers will be destroyed... except for these two. Now, these two have some interest. They have a lot of phrases in Latin and Hebrew inscribed on them. - What are those symbols? - Well, they seem to be a diagram of some sort with a lot of scribbled words in different languages. It'll take me some time to study these. However... this one has some special interest. Now, "obitus", that's a word that means death. "Signum" means marked. - Marked for death? (mysterious string music) My name is on there! - [Pastor Emery] Don't worry, Lisa. - You're fifth on the list, two below Mr. Hodges. - Mr. Hodges was murdered yesterday. (somber string music) Who is Mrs. O'Malley? (Pastor Emery sighs) - She fell down a flight of stairs at the library five months ago. She was a rich, elderly woman. Rumor had it that she was going back east to live with her sister. - I guess her death was no accident. - It was an accident. I saw the police report. - The police are in on this. (Jonas scoffs) - Or so she says. - In any case, who cares if she moved out of town? Why would that be a reason for her accident? (brooding orchestral music) - She was planning on cashing in all of her city bonds. It's that money that we use to fund the projects, like the new storefronts and the city improvements, and the city has no cash to pay her back. - So with her out of the way, the bonds can't be cashed in, and the city's free to use the money. - Normally in this case, her family could still claim the bonds, but we found out her sister passed away before she did. Her sister was her last known family member. - It was an unfortunate accident. - But a lucky break for the city. - Next on the list is Mr. Green. How did Mr. Green die? - Car accident. Our whole football team saw it. Missed his turn and straight to a fence and hit the goalpost. It was a terrible accident. - At least we thought it was an accident. - So what's his connection to Cloverville? (Jonas scoffs) - This is ridiculous. You're all jumping to conclusions. They were all accidents. - Mr. Green owned the land adjacent to the Cloverville library. - Area needed for a parking lot. - Coincidence. - Mrs. O'Malley, Mr. Green, Mr. Hodges... Mr. Gordon is next on the list. And then me. - We better notify the authorities. - The authorities? They're all in on this with Mr. Newman. - The we gotta get outta Cloverville. - No one will believe us. - Three people on this list are already dead. Now, surely that outta mean something. - We should warn Mr. Gordon before he winds up dead too. - It's not too late. I'll go. - No, no, no. Let's let Lisa go check in on Mr. Gordon. I want you to go to the County Sheriff up in Yreka. Could be that, with this list, he can be convinced that something's going on. - Assuming of course that he, too, hasn't been possessed with a demon. - [Jason] Let's hope not. - What about me? I wanna help. - I'm going to take you home. - I always miss out on all the fun. - Fun? Sunshine, this isn't a game, all right? Three people have already been murdered! - Met with accidents. - Sunshine can come with me if that's okay. We're just going to check on Mr. Gordon. (tense string music) - Please, daddy? Since they were only accidents anyway. - Fine. (engine shuts off) - Thanks for the ride. - Yeah. - We can walk from here. I know you have to get to Yreka. - Be careful. - You too. (anxious string music) - Come on. You guys can make googly eyes at each other later. - What should I say to Mr. Gordon? Like, "Hi, Mr. Gordon, you're on a death list, and I was just checking to see if you're still alive"? - If he comes to the door, then we know he's okay. - Should we go in? - Isn't that against the law? - I'll stay out here. Call me if you need me. (emotional string music) - [Lisa] Mr. Gordon? - I'm not staying out here by myself! I'm coming with you. - Mr. Gordon? (anxious string music) I need to check for a pulse! (Sunshine screams) - What? - Blood! - Sunshine, don't scream like that! - It's a dead body! - You scared me! (Lisa breathing heavily) (suspenseful string music) He doesn't have a pulse. - Can we get outta here now? (grim string music) - There's blood on that knife. - The murder weapon. - No, Sunshine, don't touch it! (siren blaring) We need to go! (dramatic orchestral music) (both breathing heavily) We need to split up. Head straight in that direction until you come to that first barn on the left, okay? That's where I'll meet you. Go! (siren blaring) (intense orchestral music) (tires squeal) - Stop! Don't move! (chatter on police radio) (Sunshine whimpering) (handcuffs ratchet) Sarge, you're gonna wanna see this. (Lisa breathing heavily) - Sunshine? Sunshine, are you there? (somber orchestral music) Sunshine? (demons cackling) What's so funny? - Your boyfriend's sister has been caught and is in jail. (demons cackling) - Belial! Tell Hyrum I will give myself up to him if he lets Sunshine go. - She'll be okay. - [Jason] Sunshine's where? - She's in jail. She's charged with murder! - Who are they saying she killed? - Mr. Gordon! They caught her at the crime scene with blood on her hands! - Come on, Dad! All right, Mr. Gordon was next on the list, and you know that! I had nothing to do with this. - Wait, what? - That means Lisa's next. - Just more of the McGrath girl's fantasies. - Jonas, what is going on? - Are you kidding me right now? They're obviously not fantasies, Dad! All right, Lisa is telling the truth, unlike you. - Watch it, son. - No. No, you lied when you said the office was broken into. - I did that for Cloverville! And you went behind my back and gave those papers to Pastor Emery! - Yeah, and I did that for Cloverville! - Hey, hey, cut it out, you two! - I just can't believe you right now. Hey, and why haven't you bailed Sunshine out yet? - No bail has been set. It's the weekend! We can't even see here until Monday. - Monday. Great. Mom, where's Lisa? - Lisa's the one who called us. She's safe. - This is all that McGrath girl's fault. That coward is sitting safely at home while your sister is in a cell! - Her name is Lisa! Okay, she's not a coward! You don't know anything about her. (somber orchestral music) - [Lisa] I'm so sorry. - [Jason] I know. - I told Belial I'll give myself up to Hyrum if he lets Sunshine out of jail. - No! No, you can't! All right, you're on his death list. He'll murder you. - There's no other way. Sunshine is innocent. I can only imagine how scared she must be in there right now. It should have been me. - Lisa, there has to be another way. All right, let's talk with pastor Emery first. Lisa, I just found you. I don't wanna lose you. (emotional orchestral music) - I'm not sure about that Yreka Sheriff. He took notes and he said he'd get back to me, but nothing. - The only way for us gets Sunshine out of jail is for me to surrender myself to Hyrum. - Absolutely not! You will never surrender to a demon! (gloomy string music) - [Lisa] I'm not going to give myself up to Hyrum. - What did you say? We already told Hyrum about your deal. - I changed my mind. - How dare you go back on your word! - You are not authorized to do that! Hyrum wants to take her blood at the Litha Sabbat. - But she got us in trouble with Hyrum again! - Go away now! Do your chores, your backstabbing liar! - It will be a pleasure to watch you bleed! - Amen? Let's pray. Father, thank you for this beautiful day. Bless each one that was in church today and protect them as they go about doing your will this day and this week. You are so faithful, Father. Thank you for your love and your presence here today. In Jesus' name, amen! - [Congregation] Amen. - That would be great. I would really appreciate that. - Oh, Lisa, I want you to meet Mr. Foma. He's agreed to help us. - It's nice to meet... Um... Pastor, may I speak to you alone? - Oh, sure. Please excuse us for a moment, gentlemen. - I think he might be an angel. His eyes were glowing white. - Ah. Mr. Foma, Lisa has noticed something odd. And before we proceed, we need to get her observation clarified. - [Mr. Foma] Continue. - Lisa informs me that you are not what you would appear to be, something of the supernatural order? - It's true. I'm an angel sent to free the girl. - And free our town from the demons? - No, I'm afraid that is your task. My assignment is to free the girl. - Why did the Lord send an angel to free Sunshine? - Hyrum has overstepped his limits. The Lord has allowed Satan to give humans a choice, but Hyrum has become a campaign to enslave humans. - Well, Mr. Foma, how can we help? - Hyrum has no legal right to take the girl without first gaining permission. Hyrum has been, shall we say, bending the rules by breaking angelic law. - So what happens now? - I must first meet with Hyrum. If he chooses to cease and desist, then he will not be taken to heavenly court. - What do you want us to do? - Do what you've been doing. Pray and follow the path that's set before you. Have faith, Jonas. - Thank you for helping my daughter. (Jonas sighs) (soft instrumental music) - I think we should pray. William, would you lead us in prayer? - Lord, use this gentleman to free Sunshine. Guide Lisa and Jason as they follow your path in saving our town. Please protect them and watch over them. We ask this in Jesus' name. Amen. - [All] Amen. - Mr. Newman's, Hyrum, has been in prison in the Abyss. - How do you know? - While you were praying, Vaniah came in and told me of a heavenly trial. (Jonas scoffs) - Oh, he just came in here and told you, did he? - Gentlemen... and lady. Hyrum has been found guilty and sent to the Abyss. (Jonas laughs) - Does that mean my daughter's free? - Yes. Sunshine is being processed for release as we speak. - Is that right? Well, I don't believe you! I'm gonna go down there right now and see for myself. - May the Spirit light your path. (door opens and closes) - Nothing is impossible with God. I think we've had more than enough excitement for one morning. We shall go. - Wait, I have one question first. What does Litha mean? - Where did you hear that word? - I overheard Belial saying I was not to be killed until the Litha Sabbat. - That's the witches summer solstice celebration. - Summer solstice is on Tuesday. - That's only two days away. - When we're finished here, I'm gonna go back and study the chart that you found at the library. Now, it may hold the key. In the meantime, you should ask Vaniah to stay close by you. (fountain gurgling) (foreboding instrumental music) - Are they dead? - Just unconscious, I guess. - There are six demons on the deck arguing about something. - This turned into a pretty interesting Sunday. - I am next in line! - I am! You are nothing more than a mere foot soldier, Zahvia, and that is all that you will ever be! - My circle is prospering the best. I should replace Hyrum. Adar... my circle has grown from three to 12 witches and warlocks in three weeks. I am the greatest. - You sure are quiet, Belial. Don't you wanna be boss? - I think we should vote on it. (demons cackling) - Vote? Are you crazy? - You've been amongst the humans far too long, Belial. We shall settle this as we always have. A fight! No weapons. No armor. The last one standing shall be the new boss. - That... is our way. (suspenseful orchestral music) That is the way Hyrum received his rank. And that is the way I, the mighty Dagon, shall receive mine! (Dragon growls) (demons grunting) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Tina] Hello? It's for you. - Hello? - [Tina] Lisa, Pastor Emery said he found something that you need to see. He's at the library. My dad and I will pick you up, okay? - No, you can't come right now! It's too dangerous. There's... There's a horde of demons fighting in my backyard. - [Tina] Are you okay? - Yeah. Jason's here. We need to get to the library. Pastor Emery found something. (demons grunting) - Well, Adar... must we continue? Will you submit to my authority? - You've best me, Dagon. (intense orchestral music) - [Dagon] Do you submit? - Yes. I swear to your allegiance. (Dagon howls) - And the rest of you? Zahvia? Belial? Moloch? Shim'on? There are no other challengers. (Adar slumps) Submit to me. - [All] I swear allegiance to your authority. (Dagon howls) - In two nights, the midsummer celebration takes place. We have gathered many animals for sacrifice. But... we are missing one important thing. That McGrath girl. Capture her. Alive! I want to kill her myself! - [All] Yes, Dagon! (Dagon growls) Adar will be my second... since he alone had the courage to fight me! - Thank you, boss. - Recruit a new demon to possess the police subject. I will not return to that body. I will possess the human called Newman. (cracks neck) He has the most power in this town. - Yes, boss. - Also, that human that helped Hyrum. I have no use for him. See to it that he's taken out of the way. - Yes, boss. - We need to go. The demons are almost finished. (somber orchestral music) - [Victoria] There she is! Get her! - No! - Lisa! (Lisa choking) (Jason grunts) (Victoria shouts) (Lisa choking) Lord forgive me. (lamp shatters) (Travis shouts) (intens orchestral music) (tires skidding) I'm sorry about your parents back there. My adrenaline kicked in. Are you okay? - Those weren't my parents. - Look after Lisa. She's been through a lot. - Hey. - Lisa, are you okay? - [William] Did you get up to Yreka? - [Jason] Yep. - [William] Anything? - [Jason] Yep. - [Tina] Thank you for meeting me here. (somber orchestral music) - Oh, good. You found 'em. I've deciphered the words on the paper you found. Now, Lisa, see if this makes any sense to you. Now, I've translated the words again, with the English meaning next to 'em. (tense string music) What is it, Lisa? - These are the names of demons. Dagon, Zahvia, Belial, Moloch, Shim'on... and all the rest. These are all names of demons I've heard. - Well, they don't seem to be in any order on that list you gave me. - Wait. This is a map. - Map? Just looks like a bunch of lines. - No, this... This long road. This is the long road that goes my house. And this... this is the church, and... here's the high school. - Yeah, I see it too. That's our house. - I don't understand these words. - Those are the words that you read in the original language. Look at the translations that I wrote on. - Where does Mr. Newman live? - [Pastor Emery] That's a good question. - Here. This circle. - That makes perfect sense, because Hyrum's name is written right next to it. Where does Mr. Jenkins live? - The vice principal? - He's a temporary principal now, after Mr. Hodge's accident. - I know where he lives. Here. - So he's possessed by Shim'on. - It's like they're each in charge of a different area in town. - I heard the demons talking about circles. - That's interesting. Circles is another name for covens. - The demons were bragging to each other about how many witches and warlocks they'd grown their circles by. - Demons? Witches, covens, for real? Like here in Cloverville? - What does all this mean? - Maybe I can get some guidance. If we pray with the names of specific demons in specific places, could you do anything about it? - Once the demon is out of the body, we can fight them, but if the demon is still inside the body, we are helpless. - I have a plan. The angels can't fight the demons when they're possessing a body. But when the demon is out of the body, then they can fight them. We need to make a group of people to go exorcize the demons and a group to stay at the church and pray. Tina, call the youth group and see who can come to church and pray. And Mr. Lynch, call the congregation to see who come as well. - Jason and I will go to the homes with you to perform the exorcisms. (Jonas sighs) - Great. We can take my car. - Let's do it. (knocks on door) (ominous string music) - Jason, hey. Is everything all right? - Yeah. I was just rethinking that scholarship. I just wanna talk to you about it. - Oh, yeah. Come on in. - Cool. - So University of Oregon. - Go Ducks. - How rude of me. My wife would normally get you all drinks, but she's not here right now. Can I get anyone anything to drink? - Uh... no. - Shim'on. I know you're in there. We're here to get you out. (Shim'on panting) - You're the McGrath girl! (Shim'on growling) There's a bounty on your head! (Shim'on gibbering) - He's not possessed! He's having a seizure! - [Pastor Emery] Jenkins is possessed! Jonas, hold him down! (Shim'on growling) - You'll pay for this! (intense percussive music) Dagon is not as soft as Hyrum! (Shim'on shrieking) - In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I command Shim'on to come out of this man! (Shim'on yelling) (high-pitched ringing) (Shim'on snarls) (blade slices) - Lisa! (Lisa gasping) Lisa, are you okay? (Lisa gasping) Just breathe. Just breathe. - I'm okay. Vaniah killed the demon. (gasping for air) - Just breathe. You all right? Easy - Told you you could go pro. (chuckles) - I had no control. That thing had full control over me. Things I said. Things I did. Things I said to my wife. My kids. All that I put them through. - Give it time. (Mr. Jenkins sniffles) I'll check in with you tomorrow. - Listen... Until now, I thought all this was a fantasy. I'm sorry. Son, I should have never doubted you. He's faster than I remember. (chuckles) (dogs barking) (bangs on door) - Excuse me. Can I help you? - Mrs. Newman. Is Mr. Newman home? - Is he expecting you? - Yeah. - Dagon! Avner, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be out making your rounds? - Sorry for the interruption, boss, but I have something you'll definitely want to hear. - Well spit it out! - Shim'on... is in the Abyss. (tense string music) - How? - I was making my rounds, collecting wandering dogs and cats, when I heard Shim'on's death scream. Then I saw that McGrath girl leaving his home. - By herself? - No. The one remaining pastor was with her, and a couple other humans. - Who were they? - I don't know. I wanted to get out of there fast, didn't want to be seen. - I want you to get the word out. Everyone is to be extra cautious. And I want everyone paired up. - Anything else, boss? - I want the McGrath captured tonight! - Attention, everyone. Thank you for coming out to pray. Well, we have a victory to report! One demon has been sent to the pit! (congregation cheering and applauding) Now, please continue to pray. We'll be leaving shortly for the next exorcism. - Sunshine! I'm so glad you're out of jail. - Me too. - I'm so sorry. I still feel like all of this is my fault. It should have been me instead of you. - No, no. If you would've been caught, they would've killed you. - All right. Where to next? - Pastor Emery, I think Lisa should stay here while we go ahead. - What? No. - Pastor. - [Pastor Emery] It's Lisa's decision to make. - Mr. Jenkins' demon already attacked you. You were its target. - And I was the only one who could see him. - Oh my God. - Without me you're blind, which means you're both safer with me there. - It's not my safety I care about. - Me neither. (soft string music) There are a lot of names on this map. Two of them are my parents. - We going? - Here. (tires screech) (intense string music) (all shouting) (Jason grunts) - Let her go! (blase scrapes) - [Warlock] See you in a thousand years! (knife stabs) (Nissan shouts) (intense orchestral music) (tires squealing) - Go. Yes. I'd like to report a kidnapping. (panting) I have a partial plate. They're in an animal control van. (Jason grunts) - Why? Why, God? (dramatic orchestral music) (Lisa screaming) - [Lisa] Let me go! (all grunting) (hand smacks) (chain link fence rattling) (Lisa panting) - I know how scared he must be. - Hey. We got through this once, didn't we? (door opens) - Did you find her? - I wasn't fast enough. (emotional string music) - There's something else. - Hey! Tell Sergeant Finney I wanna talk to him now! - The Sergeant isn't in right now! - I called you! The police! And you arrested me? What kind of backwards public service is that? - You had a warrant out for your arrest. When you have a warrant, we bring you in. Doesn't matter if you're the one who called. - A warrant! For what? - Misappropriation of government funds. The affidavit was signed by the Chairman and a fellow City Council member. - I did no such thing! And they're lying! - The D.A. is gonna send in a team to go through all of the city records. - Perfect. Hey, you know that will only prove my innocence! Hey! What about bail? - Your hearing's in 12 hours. (somber string music) - Lisa was right. Newby's not himself. - Tomorrow's the day. (silverware clatters) I can't stop thinking about her. (sniffles) It's gonna be impossible to find her. She could be anywhere. - We need one of those police dogs that can pick up scents. - Dogs? Why did you have to say that? I miss Buster. - He's still missing? - Yeah. It's been two weeks now, and I don't think he's gonna come back. - I'm sorry, Eddie. My cat's been missing for a little over two weeks now. We thought maybe a coyote got to her. - It seems like there are a lot of missing animals right now. - Yeah. You're right. I saw like two dozen missing pet flyers on Lisa's fence the other day. - Wait, do you think that Lisa and the missing animals have something in common? - Like what? - I don't know like maybe they're going to sacrifice them too? - Hold up. Do you think Lisa and the missing animals are together? - Yeah. Yeah. Why else would the animals be missing? - My dog has a chip in its neck. Isn't that supposed to be used to find your pets? Better yet, aren't most dogs tagged with chips? - RFID chips. Radio Frequency Identification microchips. I watch a lot of animal shows. Yeah. Scruffers has one too. - What's the range of the chips? - I don't know. - Me neither. - Maybe the vet knows. - We were wondering, how far can the RFID chips be detected? - That's not their purpose. They're used to identify your pet when they're found. Why are you concerned about range? - Okay. I'm just gonna be straight up with you. There's been a string of missing pets, and we're trying to find them, and we're hoping we can use the RFID chips to track 'em down. - Gabriella, can you pass me one of those GPS trackers, please. - This is our most popular one. - The collar goes around the pet. For dog owners mostly. - What's the range on 'em? - Two miles. Although, this expensive collar can go up to nine miles. And this little GPS receiver, it shows you the direction and the distance. The problem is the battery only lasts up to about two weeks. (somber string music) - Okay. By any chance, do you know anyone who bought the expensive collar and also has, like, lost a dog recently? - I see what you're trying to do. - Yeah. - Sadly, I really can't give out that information. You know, I wish I could help you, but I can't. - [Jason] I understand. (soft string music) - Oops! (papers fluttering) Jason, can you pick that up for me please? - Sure. - Please be in touch. - Thank you. Thank you, doctor. Let's go. - So what now? - Old Guns Dog Training Center on Mountaintop Road. That was the folder the doc had me pick up. Hey, let's drop off the girls. (somber string music) - Hi. - Hey. We're wondering if you lost any dogs recently. - What's it to you? - There has been a bunch of missing animals lately, and we really need help finding them. - You guys think I had something to do with that? - No, no, absolutely not. - Not at all. It's our understanding that, if you had any dogs missing, that they might have a tracking collar on them. We can use that to hopefully find the other dogs. - Been there, done that, sonny. Them dogs are outta range. - I figured that. However, I think I might be able to get closer to their general location if I had your tracking device, and it could really narrow down the search. - Well, if you were able to find Gunner and Scout, there might be a big reward in it for you, because those are some valuable hunting dogs. - Cool. Can I get your tracking device? - Well, not without some collateral. (Jason sighs) - Okay. How about this? Right, if we can find... - Gunner and Scout. - Gunner and Scout, then we'll return him to you with no reward necessary. - Might be worth the risk. (papers rustling) It's down here somewhere. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Now, this doohickey ain't worth nothing without those hunting dogs. - All right, cool. Thank you. - Hey, hey! Keep in mind, they've been gone for two weeks now. Those batteries are probably shot by now. - It's worth a shot, right? - All right. - Thank you. - Good luck. (crickets chirping) (somber string music) (tracker beeping) - They've gotta be going to the sacrifices. - [Warlock] Let's go! (Jael cackling) - You can't fool us! - We know who you are, Loverboy! - This is perfect. (Jael cackling) We can kill her boyfriend to let her watch! (dramatic string music) (all grunting) - No, please, leave him alone! It's me you want, not him! (all grunting) Lord, please help us! Vaniah, where are you? Please, Lord, we need you, please! (kick slams) (Haures grunts) (Haures cackling) (Jael shrieks) (kick slams) (blades slicing) (dramatic orchestral music) - Lisa. We gotta go. Come on. Easy. All right. I got you. All right. Here we go. - It's over, Dagon. - Look who's coming to meets his doom. - Shall we do this with honor? No weapons. A fight to oblivion. - It's you who will meet your end. - So be it. (blades clang) Give up and stand before the Heavenly Court! - We know how that will end, and I prefer an even chance! (sword clatters) (Adar shouts) (both grunting) (Adar shouts) (sword slices) - Remember, he's fast! - Thanks you the warning! Aren't there some demons needing your attention? (both grunting) (blades clanging) Give up and stand trial! (Adar growls) (Tirsah straining) (neck snaps) - When I am finished with you. Even if it's the last thing I ever do, I will capture Lisa. I will torture her... (blades scrape) for the rest of her natural life... (blade clatters) until she begs me to kill her. (Vaniah shouts) (sword plunges) (intense orchestral music) - Where's Vaniah? - I saw him run after Dagon, who was escaping through the forest. - Find Vaniah. Dagon is too powerful for one angel to handle. - Oh, ye of little faith. - Though I'm happy for your victory, I was sure you needed help. - I must admit, for a moment I had my doubts. - Tell us what happened. - The thought of my ward being tortured by that malevolent demon filled me with righteous indignation, and the power that I unleashed upon him was like the fury of 10 warriors. - Vaniah, I'm taken aback by your dedication and love for your ward. - I did what I had to do, Ebronah. (gentle orchestral music) - I need a doctor! Where are the doctors? - What happened to her? - She was lost in the forest for like two days, and she had no water, no food, no nothing! She was just... - Is she gonna be all right? - Don't worry. We'll take care of her. (tense string music) Hey. I'm not sure if you guys remember me. - Jason, right? - [Jason] Yeah. - We are so sorry. - We want to thank you. Not only did you rescue our daughter, but you saved us. - No, it was... It was Lisa. - I'm. Dr. Smith. You must be the McGraths. - Yes, I'm Travis, and this is my wife, Victoria. - And you must be Jason, the brave young man who brought her in here. She's been asking for you. - Is she okay? - Yes, but we do need to keep her a few days to be monitored. It's a good thing you brought her in when you did. - When can we see her? - Yeah, when can we see her? - We're moving her to room 127. She'll be ready for visitors in about an hour. - Thank you. - Sure. - Thank you. Sorry about- - We weren't exactly ourselves, but you already know that. - I still feel bad about it. I think I'm in love with your daughter. - I guess we were more out of it than we realized. - I hope Lisa will forgive us. I was so mean to her. My poor Lisa. - No, no. She totally understands. All she did was pray that you guys would come back to normal. - Pray? - Yeah. I'll let her tell you all about that. However, there is one thing that you guys can do that would really help. - What's that? (delicate string music) Honey? We are so sorry. We didn't know what we were doing. - I know. It's okay. I'm just glad I have you back. - Thanks for not giving up on us. - She awake? - [Travis] Yeah. - These are for you. - You're okay. - We all are, thanks to you. - Communication is the most important thing you can do to move forward and heal your relationship. - I... I know in my mind that it wasn't Ted's fault, but he said such harsh things to me and the children. - I'm sorry. I had no control. - You two aren't the only ones suffering through this. I've had many couples coming to me with similar issues. It's going to take time and talking things out to heal your relationship. - I'm willing to try. - Me too. - [Vaniah] Glad to see you're feeling better. - Vaniah. Are all the demons gone? - Yes and no. - Must you always be so cryptic? - We did have a resounding victory for the Lord. But I'm afraid the demons have not completely left this valley. - So I guess that means my job isn't finished yet. - Your job for now is to heal. May the Spirit light your path. - Mom, something isn't right. We need to turn around. - Sweetie, relax. Everything's okay. (uneasy instrumental music) Okay. (guests shouting) - I can take that. - We wanted it to be a surprise. - Woo! I told your parents not to surprise a demon hunter, but... you gotta love 'em. (both chuckling) (gentle string music) - [Lisa] Lucky! I'm so happy to see you! - Hey. - Lucky, this is Jason. - Hey. What's up, dude? Heard a lot about you. (Lisa laughs) - I think he likes you. - I think I love you. (Lisa chuckles) - I think I love you too.
