Dasy? Viola? Get up. It's late. Mom! That smoke is frying my brain! - Morning, Ma. - Morning, baby. Get up. Your coffee... Good morning! Oh my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee, and I detest my sins because of Your just punishment, but most of all because I have offended Thee, who deserve all my love. I firmly resolve to do penance, and sin no more. My God, have mercy. It's 7 A.M. We just got up. What are you praying about? Just when did you commit all these sins? I don't know how to explain it... I had this weird dream... It felt like I sinned... I prayed so I'd feel better. We'll do the finishing touches in the car. - You like it, Papa? - You're beautiful. INDIVISIBLE How many pastries are you eating? This is the third. Want some? That hooker is wearing your mother's dress! Always the poet... I'm telling you... If she keeps eating that crap, I'll puke on stage in front of everyone. - I'm hungry! - You're sick! Don't even joke like that! She has a good appetite, so what? - Yeah, she eats and I get a bellyache. - Oh, come on... - What an asshole... - Watch your mouth! These people are important and we can't look like shit. Only four songs and we leave, we're busy today. - For the encore? - "Indivisible". I want to do some Joplin! - Forget Joplin! - Why? - It's not your thing! - I do it great! No, now stop. - Nando, is all the equipment ready? - Ready. Girls, if there are any old people, mongoloids or losers, touch their heads. Titti, kiss up to Father Salvatore. The church concert is Sunday, tell him how the twins heal people, bring them luck... All that church bullshit he talks about. Sell those tickets! We have to kill it! How can I do that? Flash your tits at him! Finish their hair. I'll get you to Medjugorje this year! Wait here. Give her a round of applause! You're my pride, my emotion. Don't go anywhere either! Because very soon, we have a big surprise for you! My compliments, you two are great. I'm Marco Ferreri. I know who you are. Have you heard nasty gossip about me? - We never talk to anybody. - Good, Viola. People talk too much anyway. Right, Dasy? - How can you tell us apart? - I've been watching you for a while. You seem identical, but it's not like that... You're really different... They remind me of Anna Tatangelo, right Adele? That same grit, same verve... Really? - I discovered Anna. - We know. Now... If I could do something for one Anna, what could I do for two Anna Tatangelos? Let me manage you. I'll make you earn a ton of money. My father would hang you. Don't worry about your papa. Tell you what, here's my card. That's my cell number. We don't have cellphones. Work with me and you'll have lots of them. Call me, Dasy... even just to talk. I'd like that. Let's go. I'd cut my head off for a woman like you. - Like me? - Don't forget that. I'm crazy about you! They're really attached! Me, you, us... we're indivisible Fickle too, but that's permissible And more than a bit undividable Pretty much... indivisible! Congratulations on your First Communion! Yours... Yours... My love... Mine... I'll put this in the bank tomorrow. 18 years old... those snot noses are rich already. 339... ...6615561. ...563. ...567. Come on, tell me. Watch out! - One, two... - Wait! A fish! Who lost it? Who lost it? - Someone threw it here. - Let's throw it in the sea. Marco Ferreri, 339... ...66... ...15562. Why do you need his number? Why do you need it? It could come in handy... 3396615562. All children are equal All children are equal Listen to this. "All children are equal" "No one is no one's child" "All are born of love" "We know how we're born, but don't know how we die". That's so dark and sad. All great songs are sad! Before you saw the girls you felt constipated... And when they arrived you smelled perfume and felt lighter. Watch the coffee. Antonio, this can only be classified as a miracle. You're obsessing first thing in the morning! You're ridiculous! People laugh at you! We'll see you Sunday. "Never disappoint them," "never lose their trust" - "Never leave them alone"... - Dasy! Viola! You, me, us... always close as can be If life is asking forgiveness of you it's just an excuse Ever more futile moments In the night wind I feel you... You are the moon and I am the stars Father, the Renewal Association wants approval from the zoning board. We'll build what we need and how we need it. We don't need the zoning permits. - The girls are a miracle, aren't they? - Of the highest rank, Titti. We're all from this town and need to pray to our own local saints. You're the foundation of the new church. Sunday will be very important, so do your best. Is the Cardinal coming? What cardinal? You'll be the important people there! We don't need the cardinal. You're the future, that's all we need. We have a new song dedicated to the children of the world. - Peppe, don't ruin the surprise! - Good idea, though! Let me read the lyrics. My compliments! Thanks. I'm curious... are they really conjoined? Of course, they were born that way. That'll be enough. - Thanks, but that's enough! - Are you their parents? Not to brag... I'm their father, she's their mother. Aren't you ashamed? What? They don't seem to share any organs. - Why weren't they separated at birth? - Just who are you, exactly? I'm a doctor. I work in Switzerland. So you want to teach us poor, ignorant people that work here... Why are you making two pretty young women live as handicapped people? Mind your own business! Bring them to the clinic tomorrow. I'll examine them, no charge. Let's see if I can help. Here's my card with my cell number. Let's get to work. Stop eating! Come on, it's late. - Did you hear him? - Who? - The doctor! - Let's take a photo! Thanks! The doctor. - He wants to examine us! - Why? Don't you feel good? He said maybe he can separate us. - Who? - You and me. - Can we touch them? - Sure, it's good luck! You're beautiful! I touched them! Don't you understand? Jesus, why? - Papa, can I see that card? - What card? The doctor... He was an idiot! Did you see how drunk he was? What's the problem? Just give it to me. - I threw it out. - It's in your pocket. Are you deaf too? I threw it out! Don't piss me off, I want to see it. Stop talking to your father like a gangster! Give it to me! - Do you want to get us all killed?! - Calm down... I want to see the doctor tomorrow. I want all the examinations! - Do you hear me? - Stop with the attitude! Your head is the only thing you need examined! - Give me the card or I swear to God... - Don't take God's name in vain! - Mother of God! - Leave Mary out of it! - Stop, Dasy! - Shut up! They always said we couldn't be separated. Who said it? Them? They said it! Did you ever hear it from a real doctor?! Not that quack who said it was impossible to separate us! You never heard it said! - We're fine, why should we change? - Who's saying change? Can we at least know what's possible? About what? About what? About being normal like everyone else. Do you ever look around? Normal people go hungry and die like dogs! You have everything you need! Do me a fucking favor and stop spitting in your plates! Get out of the car. Here's the 300, Peppe. Everything okay, girls? - Can I touch you? It brings luck! - Hands off! - You sure you want to get married? - I'm crazy about her! 1... 2... 3... Testing. 1... 2... 3... Testing. Go ahead, Peppe. - What song? - "Ring, Ring". Sing! What's happening? - That's your cue. - He'll learn... Stubborn as a mule... - They're your kids. - Sons of a bitch... Give me that card. Give me that card! My thoughts run at night when all I see looks back and reminds me of you I hug my phone, but the screen is a blank And you, you... This bitter lie is sweeter than candy But you leave me breathless, and filled with hope just thinking of us It's called love Ring, ring, my cellphone ringing Ring, ring, my heart is bursting Ring, ring, you're my love Ring, ring, I forgive you Ring, ring, I still want you Ring, ring, time's running out Ring, ring, hurry to me Ring, ring, come home to me Come down! Congratulations! - You're beautiful. - I love you. Why are we doing all this? I don't know. We were one way yesterday, and everything's changed for me today. I can feel it. Ever since you met Marco Ferreri I've been feeling strange. Everything's changed since you took his card at the communion. Am I right? I don't even know that guy. Then why do I have butterflies in my stomach? This bullshit is a waste of time. I knew the time would come when they'd ask questions. - Shut up... what questions? - You know. De Gennaro, come in. It's absurd they weren't separated at birth. The reports are very clear. We've studied the images and I have no doubts. They share a vast network of capillaries that joins their bodies as one. That explains their shared sensations. For example, one eats and the other feels sick. Am I wrong? Fortunately the Vena Cava and the aortic artery are not involved. There are two bones at the hip which are distinct and separate. We can separate them. Since they've always lived in symbiosis, it could have psychological consequences. But there is a very good possibility their quality of life would be far better. - How much would it cost? - I want nothing. The important thing is that they have surgery in Geneva. Are you saying you can separate us? Yes. Papa... do you get it? 20,000 euros could change our lives... Do you get it? - Do you get it? - I get it. Here it comes again. - It's a rip off, that's what I get. - What rip off? Dr. Fasano's doing it for free. It's the trip to Switzerland, the anesthetic, the operating room... You won't pay for that, right papa? - Do you think we can steal 20,000 euros? - I'm not stupid. We earned 80,000 last year. - What are you saying? - You heard what I said. - We declared 5,000. - It was all off the books. What's this dirty talk about money! Saints take vows of poverty. - What do saints have to do with this? - Uncle... I'm not a saint, I'm a bitch! I didn't take vows of poverty, obedience or chastity! Saint Clare didn't know she was a saint either... Saint Clare didn't live attached to Saint Lucy! - You've done miracles, I have witnesses! - You know what miracle we've done so far? We survived living in this house until now! We're eighteen now and we can decide! While you live here, you'll do as I say. - Viola, you're not talking... - I'm scared of needles, uncle. Can't we talk about this after we do the first stone thing at the church? I'm almost done writing the new song. Another dark, sad song like you are. - I'm dark and sad? - You're not a lot of fun, Papa. This is the thanks I get. I made you what you are! And what are we? Monkeys? Side show freaks? That's what we are! That's what you made us! Side show freaks! See this apple? Eat it! That's all you do all day! I earned that money and now I want it! - The family needs that money. - I earned it and I want my share now! I won't give you any. There's nothing left. What are you saying? It's all gone... expenses... - Where's my money? - Gone. Gone... You gambled it? You gambled it? - Go to your room! - Mama, he gambled our money! Go to bed! - Shut up now! - You piece of shit! You lied about there being no money, right Peppe? You lied... because it's dangerous. You don't want them separated because... they could die on the operating table. You love them and worry about them. That's good, they're your kids. Of course I love them. Even if it's your fault they were born that way. We're going to bed. Goodnight. What did you mean? - Forget it. - Speak up. I mean... when you were pregnant, you were always drunk. What are you doing? Stop! Dasy was right, you gambled the money. You have it wrong... Didn't I give you everything you wanted? Are you talking about money now? Am I a poet or not? Am I a poet or not? Don't I write songs? We make money with those songs! Got it? And I do what I want with that money. I know why you want to separate... You're in love with that guy. What's wrong with that? How do you think it would work? If we went for ice cream you'd be there too? We'd go for a walk and you'd be there too? You'd be there too whatever we did. Right, Viola? Why would I bother you? I could wear earphones... Right? Isn't it annoying being stuck to me? Why would it annoy me when I love you so much? I love you too, but I feel like I'm locked in a cage. But we are the cage, we were born this way. Exactly. I want to travel. I want to go dancing. I want to drink wine without worrying you'll get drunk. I want to make love. Because I'm a woman. You whore... You fucking whore... I am a poet. I do what I want with my money. Time to get up. - Slow down, Dasy! - Don't move or we'll fall. They live underground in Bucharest They sniff glue from paper bags In Baghdad they stand on a wall touching and gazing... Kids in the Favelas like patched up rags Like tangled stars, like crumpled moons The black peaches, the African mothers Dirty and starved, they won't see tomorrow All children are born equal No one is no one's child All are born in love We know how we're born, but not how we die All children are born equal No one is no one's child First thing I'll do when we're separated is go to Los Angeles... I'll go see the ocean where they threw Janis Joplin's ashes. That's serious... Can I come? We'll see... Will they just chop us in half? They have to. Won't we have an ugly scar? So what? I'll just put a tattoo over it. Cool. I want a tattoo, too. You tattoo me and I'll tattoo you! Sure. It ends here. Maybe you were right. The Sybil will give us a sign. There's nothing here. They say she leaves signs on leaves. On leaves? It full of leaves here! The Sacred Heart! I don't understand. The Sybil has to give us a sign, so this has to be it! All children are born equal No one is no one's child All born in love We know how we're born, but not how we die We made it, Viola! Now we only need the money. They're not answering. They stole the phone and don't even know how to use it. They can't be far, how far can they walk alone? - They stole the scooter. - My scooter? They're going to Switzerland! - On a scooter? - With no money? Should we call the police? No, they're just showing off, blowing off steam... They'll be home when they get hungry for lunch. They won't be back, they're gone. That's it. Are you happy now? Don't pick a fight, you're the one with the guilty conscience. Let's deal with the more important problem for now. 30,000 euros gone... He threw all the girl's money away! Jesus! I told you that money was mine! The girls ate my food like everyone else. Especially you! - Calm down, Peppe. - You could choose your words better! Aren't you ashamed? We did our part! None of us wasted money like you! You never threw money away? - You never wasted money? Is that right? - That's right. Your Smart convertible? The mink? Our matching Rolexes? The house in Roccaraso we don't use because mountains make her dizzy! Your fancy diet! All the weed you smoke! Those aren't expenses?! Shit! Not to mention all the useless shit in this damn house! The vacuum, the blender, the dishwasher, the Nutella warmer, the juicer... the chestnut toaster! The dryer, 'cause the washer wasn't enough for her fucking highness! The steamer, satellite TV in the bathroom! The banana shaped telephone! - For fuck's sake! - Peppe, calm down! The Neapolitan Janis Joplin... Fuck her! And you have a lover too! You have a lover, I heard it all over town! - I'll rip your face off! Just watch me! - Let me see that! - A whore and two fags... - Fuck yourself! You're slobs! Go get a job! The scooter's broken. Broken? The motor died. What now? We walk. It's not far now. We're leaving the scooter like that? It's right here. It's only a few steps away. It's beautiful here, isn't it? You wanted Los Angeles? Let's do the Michael Jackson walk! The Michael Jackson walk? How many Jesus's does he have? Look who's here! They're two special sisters... The foundation of our new church! Hold hands and pray with us. That's not the problem! That's not the problem! That's not the problem! That's not the problem! You're poor inside! Sick inside! Exhausted inside! You need to change! Father Salvatore, we have big news. Do you want to make a confession now? Father, we need 20,000 euros. We could confess after we talk, okay? Remember Doctor Fasano? He did all the tests and he can separate us. Small fry like to feel grown up too... We need the money for the operation, not anything else... The operation... To separate you, of course. Did you hit your heads? Even if I had 20,000, do you think I'd just hand it over to you? - It would be an act of kindness! - Give me a break! Tell me, what would you do afterwards? People love you as you are... together! Listen... You don't want to wind up destitute like these poor souls here. Stay like you are. - Please, Father... - I'm busy now. Don't forget next Sunday. Sunday is important to us, so get rid of these crazy ideas. Those poor things out there are waiting to see you and only you! We don't want to disappoint them. - Will we disappoint them? - Who'll help us if you don't? Will you take on the burden of disappointing them? Will we disappoint them? - Please, Father! - I'm busy now! - Please! - I said goodbye. Let's go, Alma! Father Salvatore, please! Come on, move it! Peppe, we're not coming. What? We're not coming. You're not coming? That's fine! I'll drive. - Why? - You're not good at it. Kiss my ass! Get in! You knew, right? Where the fuck are they?! Where the fuck will I find them? Let's stand under there. Papa was right, you're not thinking straight. What are you doing with that? Texting Marco Ferreri, what else? Him again, come on! I'm not going home. If I'm going to fuck myself, I'll do it right! Me... me... I'm a part of this couple! You're not the only one, I'm here too! - And I want to go home! - Are you an idiot? My head aches, my feet hurt, I'm starving and I want to go home! What about all our plans together? What plans? - This is all your crazy obsession! - This is for both of us. This is for both of us. How can you be so sure? I just know. Think about it and you will too. Know what? - Fuck off! Give me that phone! - What are you doing? Give back the phone! Stop fucking around and give me the phone! - Give me back that phone! - I want to go home! I said give me the phone! Let's get separated and then you can do what you want! Viola, don't you understand? - Why separate?! - Say it with me... Separate! - Say it, you'll feel better! - No! - Say it! - I won't. Then, you can do what you want, eat what you want! - Say it! Separate! - I won't say it! You'll feel better! You can do and eat what you want! Say it! Separate! - You'll feel better! - I won't feel better! Look how we are now! Why won't you say it? - What's happening to you? - Then fuck you! I'll do it myself! Stop this shit! Say it! Say it or I'll do something crazy! - Throw that away! - Say it! Put that down... I won't say it! If we separate, you'll go away with that guy... You'll leave me alone... and I'll die without you. You're all I have. And you're all I have... No one else. I won't leave you. Come on, let's get some ice cream. I'm cold. Let's get ice cream! Calm down... Let's say an Act of Contrition. Oh my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee... Are you calm now? We're fine now. It's you and me. And there's Mary and Jesus too! It's Marco Ferreri. He says he's waiting for us on his boat. Someone will pick us up in a skiff at Volturno. Where's Volturno? I don't know, let's ask. Look at me. Again. Okay, now move. Great, move a bit. Good, now smile. Excuse me... Can you tell me where Volturno is? Just keep walking, it's not far. - Thanks. - No problem. Flex your muscles! A different pose! Do you see anything? Let's go that way. Dasy and Chiara? Are you Dasy and Chiara? Viola... Yes. Do we have to get on the boat? What if it turns over? - I'm with you. - Don't worry, it won't turn over. Can you take me over to a boat called "Tortuga"? I'm done today, I'm tired. I'll pay 100 euros! With all due respect... I don't like your face. Titti, move it! We'll find someone to take us. I'm not coming, Peppe. What? It's over. What are you saying? I'm saying those snot noses are adults and can do what they please. What can they do? - They're handicapped! - No, they're more normal than you and me. Just go home. It's over. Where will you go? Titti, where will you go? Well done! Okay, clap... You're such a dick. Go on! Leave! Leave everything! Leave your handicapped daughters! You sack of shit mother! Come on, leave! Leave your husband, he's dark and sad! Unlucky too! Go! Go to that guy! You piece of shit! You're nothing but shit! Leave! I'll take care of my kids. I'm the only one who loves them. We don't need anybody. In the water we are one, but we chose the desert Traveling in hunger, the flowers above asking the sky "What song are you singing?" Each desire is a tribe, each chord a prayer Drunk without wine full without food A hundred moons and a hundred skies Digging under rags In water we are one But when the sea is too short We widen it with our souls, ears, warm wind A wagon filled with leaves, two African eyes Growing in a direction with a rampaging horizon in our hands Drunk without wine full without food A hundred moons and a hundred skies Welcome. Let's take off your shoes. Viola, I feel like I'm dreaming. What beautiful feet you have! - They're disgusting, I walked all day. - Even better! He's weird... Let's toast! - No, thanks. - What can happen? - I don't want any. - Come on, Viola... Don't you like it? I'm crazy about you! The money! - The money! - Give me a minute! - Everything okay? - Yes! You sure? What's all the mystery? Marco... We'll sign with you. We will... but we need an advance. 20,000 euros. Shame on you... Sorry, Marco, she never talks except at the wrong moment! 20,000 euros? What do you need it for? We had some tests lately and found out we can separate. - But the surgery costs... - 20,000 euros. Why don't you shut up? Do you want to say it again? So you want an advance on a future contract. Obviously. Marco, please don't be offended. We don't know where else to find the money. At the communion, you said you'd cut off your head... for a woman like me. - Maybe I didn't understand... - No, that's what he said. "I'd cut off my head for a woman like you". For a woman like you, I'd cut off my head. I don't give a damn about money. Really? I'll give you the money. I knew it! - We'll make tons of money for you! - Just think about being well! Sing with me, sisters! Who doesn't know dark can't understand light. No one knows another, everyone's alone. Here we are! Viola, come on! Why that face? Come on! - What is it? - Drink up! Throw it! How was it? Did it burn? Yeah? That's because it was the first one! Ring, ring, my cellphone ringing Ring, ring, my heart is bursting Ring, ring, you are my love Ring, ring, I forgive you Ring, ring, come to me Ring, ring, my cellphone ringing Ring, ring, my heart is bursting Ring, ring, you are my love Ring, ring, I forgive you Ring, ring, come to me Do you have any peach tea? What do you want? Some peach tea. I'll get it for you later. I'd like some peach tea. Wait for me. I'll get your sister's tea. You always make me look like shit. Wake up! This is no dream, you know? You're not dreaming. Who are you? Answer me. Don't stare at me. Who are you? Who? Is this you? Is this your life? Answer me. Stop crying. Answer me... Do you want to be a whore? Do you want to be his whore? Hurry up! Take the money! - What are we doing? - Shut up and move! What do you want to do? Give it to me! - What if he comes? - Shut up! Hurry! - We're fucked! - Stop worrying! - What can we do?! - Stop being a baby! Look at me! The ship is moving! See those lights? We're going there! We'll die in the sea! It's better than dying with that prick! At least we'll die with some balls! Are you serious? Dasy! Look at me! - We're floating! - I'm afraid! Don't be a baby! We have to backstroke! Keep going! Swim! I can't do it anymore. We have to reach the shore! - You know what's over there? - What? It's Los Angeles! What does Los Angeles have to do with us now? - I want a nice guy, not a prick! - A serious nice guy! - Who would you like? - A normal guy! So swim, Dasy! Keep going! Swim, Dasy, swim! Thank God. I was scared to death. See? - It's all right now. - I'll take them home to rest. I'm sorry we can't come for the laying of the first stone. - Dasy and Viola are sinners now. - They're just two angry girls... They've certainly suffered violence. We'd have to exhibit the signs of that. There must be signs. - They can't even stand up. - They were lost and are found. They were dead and they live. We need to know if they're penitent and back in God's grace... ...more than they were before. There we go, Papa's here... Just a touch of kohl. Just as you like it. We don't need anything or anybody. Papa's going to buy you a cellphone. A computer? No problem! Your papa will get you anything you want. F minor. Don't forget... Sometimes you have to spill blood, but when it's done... you're better off than before. You girls are special. You can do good. You're the future. And no one must ever forget that. No one. You're stronger than me. Glory to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit As it was in the beginning and ever shall be, world without end, Amen My soul doth magnify the Lord And my spirit rejoices in God my savior For He hath regarded the lowliness of his handmaiden For Behold from henceforth all generations shall be called blessed For he that is mighty hath done to me great things and holy is his name. And His mercy is on them that fear Him throughout all generations He hath showed strength with His arm and scattered the proud in their hearts imagination He hath put down the mighty from their seats and hath exalted the humble and meek He hath filled the hungry with good things and the rich He hath sent empty away Glory be to the Father and the Son and to the Holy Spirit As it was in the beginning and ever shall be. World without end. Sing. All children are created equal... All children are created equal... All children are created equal... Stand back! Let her breathe! Let her breathe! Take off the veil! Don't leave me! Dasy, speak to me! Dasy, Los Angeles. Los Angeles, Dasy! Dasy, speak to me!
