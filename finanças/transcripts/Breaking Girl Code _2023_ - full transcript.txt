Thanks for inviting me out last night, but do you know how I got home? I'm kind of freaking out cause I woke up with bruises. What happened? Hi, you must be Miranda. Okay, this way. Have a seat. - Sure. - Mh-hmm. Mmm. I see you interned with Harper Collins and Random House. Yeah, I wanted to get some professional experience. So I spent two summers in New York. And how did you enjoy it? Oh, I loved it. I learned so much, and of course, the city is amazing. That's very proactive. Normally when we get an applicant with a degree like yours, it's because they're not ready for real work. Oh, you know it took a lot of work to get those degrees, but I completely understand your concern and can assure you that I am ready to do some real work in the real world. Love that, and if I call you your references in New York, what do you think they'll tell me? Well, they wanted to hire me, so I think they would have great things to say. They offered you a job. Yes, they did. It would've been in New York though, so it wasn't the best fit for me. But you just said you loved it t Yes I-I did. Yeah, I wanted to be close to my boyfriend though. Let me give you some advice Andi. You see that Gloria Steinem quote on the wall? Boyfriends come and go. You are a very bright young woman, and the best thing you can do at this stage of your career is to surround yourself with other bright young women. Good luck. You know, Gloria Steinem didn't say that. They just used these little quotes to sell T-shirts and posters. Hey. How did it go? Uh, not great. They asked about the job in New York, and when I told them I couldn't take it, they kind of wrote me off. I'm sorry to hear that Andi, how are you feeling? Uh, you know, nothing a little Netflix and dinner won't help fix, care to join me? I wish I could, but I have to work tonight. Again? Rookies get the worst shifts. You know, that just kind of makes me wish that we would've gotten a place together, at least we could see each other before you go to work. Yeah, but then you miss out on having your own place in the city. The appeal of that kind of went away whenever I got into the job search. Maybe it's good we held off. I mean, I'd have to start putting the toilet seat down. You'd have to stop singing Adele in the shower. Oh, why would we want that? I'm a great singer. Oh, of course you are honey. I guess just have a good day and be safe. Why don't you reach out to Zoe and Jane? They're out here too, aren't they? Yeah, I'll reach out to them. I mean, you shouldn't have to be alone just because my hours are crazy. No, I mean, I have other friends. Yeah, your books don't count. You know what? You are so funny, bye. This doesn't feel sad at all. What's this? Just like a dating app, find friends, make connections, and build valuable relationships. About yourself. Um, okay, recent grad, new to the city. I'm looking for, I guess, friends who like volleyball, Lizzo and Edith Wharton. I need something else. Oh! Let's grab a rose. Uh, no, this is kinda corny. Let's see. Okay, is it Halloween? No. Uh, no. New to the city looking for new friends. Unbelievable. Wow. Yeah. Cute names, right? Gotta love a good pun, I'm Farrah. Andi, hi. You seem anxious, are you okay? I guess I'm just a little nervous. I've never met anyone from an app before. There's no need to be nervous. I meet women on here all the time. Really? Yeah, it's actually really fun once you get past the boring stuff, you know? How long have you been in Boston? What do you do? Got it. So the boring stuff, right? Um, okay, okay, I moved to Boston like three months ago, and I guess I'm just still looking for that first job out of college. I've been there. Oh, you're a transplant? No, I actually have lived in Boston my whole life. Thank you. Um, but I totally remember how hard it was to get started. Do you have friends or family here that you can stay with? Um, I mean, I have my boyfriend. We barely see each other though, because he works so much. And I guess if I had any friends I wouldn't be on the app. I get it, my boyfriend also has a super demanding job. It makes me appreciate the time we do have together, so. Yeah, and it allows time for friends. Which I would think since you're from here, you probably have a lot of friends from high school. Yeah, yeah, I know a few, um. I was kind of a nerd in high school. Well, you know me too. Really? Okay, what's your favorite classic? Oh, "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings". Solid. Thank you, how about you? Frankenstein. Okay, your favorite mystery writer? Daphne du Maurier. Favorite Bronte. You're gonna make me pick just one? Okay, you can have two. But only if we agree that Jane Eyre is way overrated. Oh, no worries because it totally is. Good. So dumb, so basic. Yeah basic. Speaking of basic, there's something I really have to show you after this. All, right. Fun and basic. So according to the Boston Historical Society, Sylvia Plath used to write here. What, really? How crazy. Okay, so this is the basic thing So cute, right? Kinda love it. Do you think you can get a picture of me? Oh yeah, let me use my phone. I'll send it to you. Okay. Yeah. Smile, oh my gosh, so cute. Did you wanna get in? Oh, I'm sorry, is is that dorky? No, no, no, I definitely do. Smile. Wait, that is so cute. It is, this was so much fun. We should do it again sometime. Yes, wait, okay. So I'm meeting some friends for drinks on Friday. Do you have plans? I don't, so I can totally make it. Okay, great. I'll text you the details. Okay, well see you Friday. - See you Friday. - Sure. Bye, I'll text you. You know, you just gotta be in the know, like Farrah told me about the store on the west side that has a conveyor belt bookshelf. How does that work? I don't know, but, it sounds cool. Sounds like you met your perfect match. Oh, well I wouldn't say that. Oh. - Gotcha, okay. - Thank you.. So where are you going tonight? Some bar, I don't remember the name. It's like on the river above, I don't know, Pool Hall or something. Oh. Oh, you mean The Break? Yeah. Have you been there? Oh, no, no, I just heard that to get up into the club you need a password, now are you sure Farrah can get you in? Are you doubting my BFF. No, no, I'm just saying that as a local guy, I'm a little skeptical. Well, maybe that local girl has better connections than you. Oh, you want a bet on it? You know, I do. And if I win, I would like, you know a real drink at a real restaurant on a real date with you. Deal. Everything okay? Hey, I promise you, a few months from now, you'll be happier than what you are now, okay. Also, you're going out tonight and you're going to have a great time. Okay? I have friends. You do. Andi, you made it. - Hey. - Nice to meet you. - Welcome. - You know what? Why don't I get the first round of drinks? - Oh no. - Oh, that's sweet. I'll get it for you. This is the secret password bar. Hi. What can I get for you? Evening Breeze for five. No problem, it'll be right down. What's an evening breeze? It's not a drink. We're here. Kayla, do you still wanna dip out early? This is the bar I was telling you about. Yeah, how'd you hear about this place? Well, my boyfriend and his coworkers go to the coolest places and he tells me about them. Uh, will Ethan be joining us tonight? Yes, and he's bringing by some friends. He'll be here in a few minutes, probably. Actually, this is him. Get comfortable. Oh, I love your earrings. Oh, thank you. I got them at the flea market in New Orleans. Are you from NOLA? No, but I did live there for a year, after college I decided to move to a new place every year. And so far I've done Portland, New Orleans, and I just got here from Santa Fe. Oh Santa's awesome. I was there for a tour and I absolutely loved it. Ooh, what kind of tour? Oh, I'm my dancer. I was on tour with Ariana Grande Wait, seriously, what was she like? I mean, she was my boss's boss, so I didn't really get to talk t but the tour was great. - Good. - Still kind of fancy. Yeah. Kayla, right, how do you know Farrah? I just met her tonight. Really? She messaged me and invited me out for a drink. Yeah, that's how I met her as well. Yeah, me too. I mean, I guess she wasn't joking when she said it's a great way to meet people. Oh, yeah, I've been enjoying it. I've been out with Farrah a couple times and she's sweet. Oh, and her boyfriend's posse is great for the Tinder diet. Tinder diet? Yeah, where you go out with a guy for a free meal. - What? - Yeah. You don't think that's like taking advantage? Yes, okay, which is why I only do it with gross guys. You know the type, the one that's, they say they're looking for a confident, sexy girl who takes care of her body. Yes, exactly. - So F Boy. - Exactly. All right, all right. Listen, okay. They only message me because they like my body. I only respond to them because I'm broke and I like to eat. I'm with it. So, so, do you think that Farrah's boyfriend is? Mm-hmm. Him and each of his friends, okay. They're all big shots at different firms around the city, and they think that that makes them hot sh... They just walked in. Mm-hmm. I told you. Is this like a hookup or we like blind date? No, oh, no, no, no. Okay. I just wanna make sure, I have a boyfriend, so. Oh my God. Miranda, you remember Ethan? - Yes. Hello. - And this is Kayla. This is Holly and this is Andi. It's great to meet you all. I'll introduce my friends in a second, but let me get everyone around her drinks first. Oh no, you don't have to buy everybody... Don't worry about it. I'm friends with the owner, so whatever you want. Order it to my tab. Oh, well that's pretty sweet. And I'll go talk to the DJ and get him to turn on my favorite song. Can you do that? Tonight, we can do whatever we want. Okay. Four shots, please. - Oh. - Make it five. Make it six. I like her. ♪ We like to party every day ♪ ♪ Party party every day ♪ ♪ We like to party every day ♪ ♪ Party party every day ♪ ♪ Party every day ♪ ♪ Party party every day ♪ ♪ We like to party every day ♪ ♪ Party party every day ♪ Have you seen Farrah? Man, she's been stuck to his side since we got here. Oh, well maybe it's love. Farrah, Farrah come dance. I need water. ♪ Party every day ♪ ♪ Party party every day ♪ Who's that? To your right. Yeah, I think he's checking you out. Boyfriend. Hey, it's Andi, right? Yeah, Jason? Good memory. Yeah. Are you enjoying the club? Ethan said you just moved to the big city from a small town. That's cute. Yeah, but I've lived in other big cities before. - I've lived in New York. - Wow. Globe trotter. I guess. Are you a model? No, I'm trying to get a job in publishing, actually. Oh, you're kidding. I would've thought you were a model. I've gone out with a few. Okay. You just had that look, you know gorgeous and exotic. Yeah, you wanna get out of here? Thanks. Oh, can you get off of me? I have a boyfriend. But he doesn't have to know. Okay, seriously, stop. - Oh. Wow. - You okay? Yeah, that was, I should probably go. You sure? Yeah. Hey, I'm gonna head out. Wait, really why? Yeah, we can't convince you to stay for one more drink. No, I have a early morning, and honestly, Jason kind of touched me and it just ruined the mood. Jason touched you. Yeah. I'm so sorry, he can be a moron when he drinks. Well, if you can just make sure he doesn't do it again and keep an eye on him. Yeah, we'll take care of it. See ya. - Get home safe. - Wonderful meeting you. - You too. - Goodnight. What's her name again? Andi. I like her, she's feisty. Where were we? Hey, Andi, I know you can hear me. What, you don't wanna talk to me? Free drink? It's top shelf. Trust me, you're gonna wanna try this. One drink. That's all I need. Evening officer. Yeah, it's morning. Yeah, but you haven't been to sleep yet. So I figured I would bring you dessert. Come on, they were in the air for like 20 minutes. Oh, that's really not fair, come on. Missed you. Were you sleeping? Yeah, yeah. How was the other night? In the club? Yeah. It was great. You know, they had these lights that would blink on and off, like to the sound of the music. It was kind of extra, but I liked it. I enjoyed it. And Farrah's friends were cool. They were, um, they were really nice. But the club, I think you would really like it. We should go together sometime. I mean, not anytime soon. I know you're really busy. Just, you know whenever you have a chance. Yeah, well, um. Hey, listen. I think we should spend time apart. Er, um, what? It's just, my schedule's going to be awful over the next few months. I'm trying to squeeze in time together with my crazy hours. It's just, it's really hard. I mean, it's hard, but we knew that that would happen. We knew that before I moved here, Sean. Okay but your schedule is temporary. And then I'm gonna have a job too. Because it's gonna get easier when you start working too, right? How long have you been thinking this? Maybe a month. Oh, since I moved here. Look, I thought it would be great to have you here and we could work towards something, but it just seems like it's just more distance between us and we're both stressed and overwhelmed, right. And, and even... No, if you just wanna break up, you can say it. That's not, that's what I want. No, you do, you wanna break up, but you're just, you're too afraid to do it. Hey. Hi, just checking in to see if you're okay after last night, what Jason did really wasn't cool. Andi, what's wrong? Do you just, you think we could meet up? I could really use a friend right now. No like, I know I shoudn't, I shouldn't feel this way. Like, just overwhelmed. I just, I feel like such an idiot. Like I'm in a city I don't know, with no job, no family, no friends, and now no Sean. And this is nobody's fault but my own. No, okay. Give Sean some credit, okay. You're in this mess because he made plans and then backed out of them. No, but I should have known better. I decided to stop everything for a relationship. You made a big gesture for Sean because you care about him, that's so generous. That's not something you should beat yourself up over. That's something he should be ashamed for not recognizing. Do you need to get that? Oh. No. You know, thank you Farrah for being there for me. And I know we haven't known each other very long, but I appreciate you stepping up and showing up for me. Really, anytime. Shannon, Shannon Waters. I'm sorry, I don't. Farrah, Farrah Priestly. We went to high school together. Oh, right, hi. Um, this is my friend Andi. Obviously not from high school. So how have you been? Good, yeah. Same, me too. Just been working and enjoying the city, you know, it's nice. I gotta go. Okay, um, it was so good seeing you. Yeah, you haven't changed a bit. And so you two were tight in high school. Please don't laugh. Farrah, I would never laugh at you, besides, she seems like a real jerk. Um, yeah, you're right, um. Sorry, seeing her just kind of like takes me back to a dark time. I didn't really have a lot of friends and I didn't really know how to talk to people. I would just hide behind my books. Try not to be so invisible. Oh, I-I get that. But you're not in that place anymore. Okay, look at you. You know you're not alone now, right? Yeah, it all changed when I met Ethan. When I'm with him, I just, I really feel like I matter to someone. You know, this might be newly single Andi talking, but does Ethan always act the way he did the other night? What do you mean? You know, he just seemed like he was hovering over you the whole time. Yeah, I think that's just how he shows affection. Oh yeah, I'm probably just overthinking things. I should actually get myself cleaned up and then maybe we'll go for a walk. Yeah, yeah, I'd really like that. Woo! Hey love. Hey babe, we're going to Pinnacle tonight. I need you to bring Miranda and the feisty girl. Um, okay, I'll try to get them. But I haven't heard from Andi today. You didn't text her? Come on Farrah, you promised to help me with this, I'm counting on you. I know, I'm sorry, Ethan I just thought since, you know what happened with Jason last time, that maybe we forget Andi. Mmm, nah, the boys liked her. They want another shot. Ethan, I don't... Farrah, don't go against me. Okay. Don't let me down. I am so happy that I came out tonight. - Really? Good, good. - Yes. Yay, and Miranda's gonna be here soon. - Oh that'll be fun. Yay. - Yes, yes. And Ethan said he is gonna stop by with some friends, if that's cool? And by friends. No, not Jason, I promise. - He promised me. - Uh-oh. What did I promise? Nothing. Hi, baby. Andi. Hi, I'm Marco. Hey, I'm Andi. I was gonna get a drink, can I get you one too? Sure, why not? I'll take a scotch, neat. And for the lady? I'll just do a seltzer there with lemon and lime. I can order you a real drink. No, no, I'm okay with just the seltzer. I uh, I thought you were here to have fun tonight. Didn't you just break up with someone? How do you know that? Ethan had mentioned it. He wanted to make sure the guys treated you right tonight. So, do you normally run a little wild after a breakup? What? No, I will probably be by myself for a while. Where's the fun in that? You like to play hard to get, hu No, I'm not playing. Excuse me. You okay? Um, yeah, thanks. You came with Farrah, right? Sorry, I'll leave you alone. You work with Ethan, right? Yeah, I'm Charlie. Andi. You're welcome to hang out, but I don't know if I'll be a good company tonight. Neither can I, I was dumped recently. Same. But I guess you already know that. Well, Ethan, he has a way of knowing everyone's business. I mean, convinced me to come out tonight with everyone, get back on the horse, that kind of thing. But I don't know if this is really my kind of scene. So why did you come out? I mean, I was just promoted, so I still have something to prove to these guys. And it'd be stupid to turn down an invite from Ethan. I mean, he's a legend at our firm. He started this club, right? It's exclusive to people at the top of their field. I mean financiers, lawyers, entrepreneurs. Everyone with him is on track to be a millionaire by like 35, I mean, if they're not already there, right? Invite from Ethan is an admission to the most powerful networking club in the state. Let me guess, the club is boys only, right? Refreshing. You know, I would give an excuse or explanation for that, but I'm guessing you'd shoot it down, right? Accurate, yes. All right, fair enough. Fair enough, uh. You know, for what it's worth, I think it's messed up. And yet you joined. Yeah, the club opens doors. I don't come for money, right? So I'm just doing what I have to for my career. No, I get it, you know. You had no choice, poor you. All right, all right, well, tell me this, if a club like this could get you your next job, would you join? Shut up. That's not a no. Not a yes. You know I'm right. - I mean, millionaire by 30, 35. - Right? Maybe. I don't know, I texted her. She said she was coming. You texted Kayla. We were done with her. You could go to another bar. Too late. Fix this, don't make a scene. Okay? Hey Kayla, how are you? You deleted me. What? I told you what he did, and you ghosted me. You wanna talk outside, it's quieter. I'm not going anywhere with you. Why haven't you answered me? I just thought it'd be better if I stayed out of it. How is that better? Jason assaulted me. Are you sure? I saw you two leave together, you seemed happy. You think I was happy when he did this? Did you know what a creep he was? What is wrong with you? How could you do that? Hey, hey, hey. It's time for you to go. Not until I get your friend's full name and phone number. You can give it to me or you can give it to the police. Or I could send these to your boss. There's plenty to pick from, but I think this one's your best angle and it doesn't look like you're being forced does it? Leave now, you'll never hear from us again and these photos won't go anywhere. You've done this before, haven't you? I'll see you around. I may have to leave early. You have photos of her? It's just insurance, don't worry about it. How long have you done... I said, don't worry about it. It's just photos, right? You don't do anything else to scare them. If I do, it's because you couldn't keep them away. This was your screw up and now I'm the one who has to fix it. I don't know how I can count on you Farrah. Hey, so what do you think we ditched this place? You know, I'm feeling like I'd have more fun at my apartment with some pizza, we call Holly, Miranda and maybe watch Love Island. Maybe Selling Sunset. Yes, yes. Um, but I'll need to borrow your Netflix password 'cause I just don't feel right using Sean's. - Yeah. - I can't see logging back in. Hey, come on. So, I made him split the bean salad with me. You are an evil genius. Right? Weaponizing IBS to get out of a date is poetic. Thank you. I guess we're lucky you didn't have any Tinder diet plans tonight. Oh, I did, but I canceled. Wait, wait, you canceled your for us? Yes, I guess I'd rather hang out with you. Don't make a big deal out of it. - Shut up. Shut up. - But it is a big deal. You know what else is a big deal? Have you been out on her fire escape? Kind of fabulous, you must see it. Really? Oh! Oh my gosh, they're gonna be out there forever - just taking selfies, so classic - Yeah. I ate so much. It's so good though. I know. Okay, now he was mean to you, you don't have to rush to text him back. I know, but he just doesn't like being embarrassed in front of his friends. You know, I get that you guys have been together for a long time and that he's nice to you some of the time. But that doesn't mean that you owe him anything. Some of the time it's better than nothing. You can't really think that. No one's ever kept me around. Not friends, not boyfriends. And when I met Ethan, our relationship was like a dream. He made me feel like I meant something while everyone else wrote me off. Okay, but just because everyone else didn't see it doesn't mean that it's not there You're an amazing person and a good person. You deserve the best. Not him tonight. Pizza. It's stunning. - So lucky. - No, there's only one bite. No, no, no. I was gonna eat the last one. Oh you were were you? It's my house. Congratulations again. What? Sorry, I'm sorry. Sorry, I got a job. - You got a job? - I got a job. We're at the scene of an evening hit and run that has left a local grad student in critical condition. 22-year-old Kayla Grayson was struck by a vehicle on her way home. Any witnesses to the accident are encouraged to call the Boston Police tip line. Andi, hey. - Hey. - What brings you here? I just got a job with Athena Publishing upstairs. Do you work in this building? Yeah, our firm is on the top floor. Should come up and visit sometime if you wanna see the view from the top. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Can you hold that? Jason, good morning. Shannon, did you read my report? I did, your assistant did good work. Should give her a raise. Congratulations on the new gig. You should come out with us this weekend to celebrate. I already have plans, but thank you. Hey, you know that guy? No, not really. He's in some club with Farrah's boyfriend, so I see him from time to time. Oh, you were in the cafe, Andi, right? Yeah, right. So Farrah, Farrah Priestley is Ethan's girlfriend. Yeah. Wow, that sad, stupid girl. Don't you have to be on the top floor? Here, take this. If anything weird happens when you're out with Ethan, give me a call. After hearing what you have to say about my friend, I doubt I'll have anything to say to you. Andi, tell us about your first week. Oh my God, guys, this publisher is amazing. Like they represent all of these just cool, diverse voices. And they have me working on a campaign for romance series. - Okay. - Amazing. That's amazing. Oh, that's so great. It sounds like you got exactly what you were looking for. I think I did. Oh, speaking of living my dream. I got a call back for another tour tomorrow. - Cheers. - Yes, cheers to that. To you too. Yes, oh my gosh, that's amazing. Uh, not to be a downer, but did you guys hear that Kayla was in a car accident? Yeah. What, when? Apparently sometime this weekend. I heard about it on Monday. Yeah. Is she okay? No, apparently she's in a coma. Farrah, you invited, Ethan? No, I just told him we were going out. I heard we were celebrating, congrats Andi. - Thanks. - Hi baby. Hi. I thought you're going out with boys. It's not really a night out without you and the girls. What do you guys say to another round? Let's liven this party up. Now it's a party. Thank you. Right, everybody grab a drink. Cheers to Miranda and Andi. Cheers. - Congrats guys. - Have a good night. All right guys, this isn't how we enjoy Friday night. Come on ladies, let's dance. Okay. Okay, oh my gosh. I think I'm gonna come back. Oh, loosen up Andi, tonight's for you. You want to enjoy it, right? How is tonight for me? I'm sorry I'm a little off tonight. I kind of saw Shannon downstairs, messed with me. Shannon? Yeah, I kind of think she's trying to get up here. I just like, don't want any trouble. Okay, well maybe I'll go downstairs and just - check it out. - Are you sure? I can do it. No, I don't think you should have to deal with two bullies tonight. I'll take care of it. Get her to loosen up will you? Okay. There's club regulars, Ethan and Farrah, if you hear or see anything fishy, can you let me know? Hey, hey. What are you up to? The other day you couldn't be bothered with Farrah and now you're asking everyone about her and Ethan. What do you know about Ethan's club? It's something of a myth at our firm, Ethan invites these high power guys from different industries out every week with promises of VIP clubs, free booze, and a string of hotties to drool over. I thought they were just rumors until a few weeks ago. My friend Jessica, she went out with a group of guys and woke up the next day covered in bruises without any idea how she got them. And she thinks someone from the club did it? Can't prove it, but yeah, this email was sent the day after Jessica was hurt, Jason's assistant was leaving the firm and forwarded it to me. Look at what Ethan wrote. Flowers on ribs and back. Okay, I don't, what does that mean? Jessica has a lily tattooed on her rib and a daisy on her lower back. Did she go to the police? I couldn't get Jessica to report it. She'd been assaulted before and the first one was, it was a lot of trauma without much of a result. She didn't wanna go through that again. But I know Ethan is behind this. I wouldn't put it past these guys, but you have to have something else besides this email, right? Jessica was invited out that night by a friend she made on the Be Friends app. Her name was Farrah. Never would've thought it was the Farrah I knew from high school but small world, I guess. Yeah, I need to talk to Farrah. Are you serious? After everything I just told you. Yeah, I Farrah, can we talk to you for a sec? Yeah, what's up? Do you see what's going on? Yeah, everyone's just having fun. They're just dancing. Fun, do you know somebody named Jessica? I just wanna go dance, come on, come with me. No, I don't wanna dance. Who are these guys, why are they always around? They're just Ethan's friends, okay. They just come because they're friends, it's okay. They're just here, trust me. Just give them a chance, okay? Just come dance, it's okay. No, it's not fine. Holly, Holly, you okay? No, I feel really sick. Okay then come on, let's get out of here. Okay, come on, get your stuff. Elevator's here, right? I can actually, I can help get Miranda home. It's okay. I live really close and offered to let her crash on my couch. Oh, well you know what? I don't think any of us should be driving alone or anything. Maybe we could all ride with you and go back to your place for a fun time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe one more drink, would you mind getting me one more drink. Do you mind just taking over for me for a second? Hang on with Andi for a second, okay? I'm gonna be right back. Okay, we'll be here. Come on, somewhere quiet. No, wait! Oh god, please let there be a lyft right now. Did one of you give Marco my number? He just texted me saying this isn't over. All right, come on. Come on, let's go. Okay, take my shoulder. I'm gonna throw up. Okay, let's just make it outta here. How you feeling? Morning. God, how late were we out last night? Um, we got in about 12:30. Thanks for letting us stay. We must have had a lot to drink. Do you remember anything from last night? Either of you? We didn't drink that much. We had the one drink at the cocktail place and then another at the club. Then why did we black out? Look, there's an urgent care about three blocks away. Okay, we can find out if somebody spiked your drinks. I have to get home. Holly, do you wanna split an Uber? No, we should get you to the hospital and get you checked out. I can't Andi, my callback is this afternoon. I need to shower and change and get downtown. Okay, listen, I know it's a really big opportunity for you, but we should find out if something happened. All I know is I got away safely and thank you for that. But I'm not like you, I don't work in marketing. I'm a dancer. I can't afford a hospital bill just to find out if I was drugged. So I'd rather just land this job, leave town. Never see those guys again. Okay, but those guys could do this again to somebody else. Kayla, does anybody know why she just stopped coming around? My ride is almost here. Miranda. You're free to come if you want. Thanks Andi, you take care of yourself, okay? Hey, can we meet? Yeah, I just, I need you. - Hey. - Hey. Good to see you. Of course, yeah. Should we? Oh yeah. Sorry, here, I got you. Have any of them contacted you? Not since Marco threatened me. You know, is there anything you could do? I can give my CO a heads up, but at this point I don't think anything will come of it. What do you mean, they drugged women, that's a whole crime. Yeah, and to press charges, we would need Miranda and Holly to report it. Get blood work and prove that they were drugged. But even if they do guys like Ethan lawyer up fast and I don't have to tell you like it's gonna be hard to make these charges stick. Okay, and then putting Kayla in the hospital. She'd have to identify the driver who hit her. But if she is in the ICU, there's a good chance that she won't remember the accident when she wakes up. I mean like for crying out loud, Sean, you could, you could follow them. You know, it's just a matter of time before they do this to someone else and you could be right there. Cops can't watch everyone, we know it'll be dangerous. We can only respond to a crime after it's committed. Okay? So they get to just keep assaulting women unchecked. Until one of the women come forward, yeah. You know, you make it seem like it's the women's fault that this continues to happen. That's not, that's not what I meant. I'm just saying it's not your job to stop these guys, okay. Maybe it's better if you step away from them. Like Miranda said. How do you suggest I do that? They work in my building. Well maybe that could be good for you. You can notify building security and they can keep a watch out for anything untoward. Did you just say untoward? It's in my textbook. Look at you. Ha. You know, actually, I do think there's someone at the office who can help me with this. I'm gonna ask her. In the meantime, hopefully nothing too untoward happens. Shannon, I need to talk to you about Ethan and Farrah. Okay, let's go this way. Wait, isn't your office this way? I'd rather Ethan not overhear that we're talking about him, wouldn't you? Right, right, right. Okay, what's going on? We've gotta get Ethan. So we've gotta get to the police with some concrete evidence. We need someone who's been drugged to come forward. I was thinking, if you'd be willing to go out with him again. What and risk getting date raped, are you crazy? I have a friend in the club who could watch your back. Who? Charlie. He used to work for me before his promotion and when Ethan gave him the invite, he agreed to tell me what he saw. Yeah, like no offense to Charlie but he was at the club the other night when I almost got date raped myself. Okay, then our other option is to watch them and see if we can catch them in the act. Provided they don't catch a spying on them first. What if we can report them for carrying an illegal substance? Rohypnol is illegal and Ethan probably keeps it at work. It always seems like he's going to the club straight from work. So if they find it here, that could work. It could, I guess I can check his office. Yeah, and then I can have Farrah check his apartment. She's already working with them. Why would she change teams? Because they treat her like trash. If you tell Farrah what we're trying to do, she'll just turn around and warn him. Not if we convince her to take our side. Farrah has never had friends, you know? Have you considered that maybe if there was someone in her life ever who just gave her a chance and maybe saw her as a person, that maybe we wouldn't be in this position. You know, if we turn Farrah in, she'll be the one to blame for the stuff that they did. She'll have to take their consequences. Okay, no, I get that she's lonely but she's not stupid. She found you and all the others and she knew what would happen to you. Look, ultimately, we need Farrah. Okay, fine. Give Charlie and me a few days to look around and if we don't find anything then we'll go with your plan. Thank you. I still don't think it'll work. Yeah but Farrah will appreciate you for giving her a chance. Don't be gross. Are you coming? I'll wait a few minutes, I don't want anyone seeing us together. Hello? Hello? Gave me no details whatsoever. I don't even understand what's going on. They have to make a bigger. I don't know what we're supposed to do. Am I supposed to send everybody home? I hope so. I just. What? Security just called, somebody's been assaulted in the stairwell. In this building? Yeah. Andi, Andi. What? You know her? Sean, We were just right here, we were just talking about these guys and how to catch them. Sean. Keep your voice down, you don't want anybody to hear that. Want anybody to hear? I don't want them to hear the motive for her murder? If Ethan or any of the other guys did it we'll get security footage to place them here, but we have to let the evidence do that. We don't wanna place you at the scene of the crime, okay? If they know I was here, then... They would create reasonable doubt and get them off. Hey, Maya a little help over here. Yeah, yeah, be right there, hey, hey. Go in there and talk to your boss. Tell him you need to leave, okay? I'll give you a ride home. You can look, but don't stare. At least tell me you have something planned for Andi. Obviously, she's practically begging for it. Really, Farrah? Andi, what are you doing here? I was supposed to meet Shannon. Oh, um. Yeah, I know. Okay, so what are you doing here? I think Ethan killed her. Charlie, Shannon told me that she said that she would spy on them at the club. They must have told you what they do, would killing her so she would keep it a secret, would that be so farfetched? Maybe not, which is why I don't wanna get in the middle of it. And neither should you. I can't just keep my head down, I can't look the other way. Andi, if people are dying, this isn't the time to be a hero Oh, forget about being a hero. It's my life. Okay, you can maybe get away and just walk away, but I can't. Please Charlie. Oh, I think he's heading back. Okay, let me get you outta here. No, no, no. I have a couple more things I have to get. He can come back any second. Yeah, so I need you to go stall him. Just go out there and talk to make sure he doesn't come in here. Hey Ethan. Do you have a second? Sure, let's talk in my office. Actually, can we talk in mine? It'll only just take a second. It's about that self firm - that I'm visiting right now, - Right. They're just worried about the distribution. - They wanted to... - They are? Well, they just wanted to set up a meeting. They're free Thursday to discuss it. We work with accounts five times their size. Right, but if you look at these numbers that we were looking at, they're pretty close to what we normally pull in. Sure, let's make sure they're comfortable. They're thinking of investing more. Really? Yeah, like a six figure range. And maybe bringing in those other accounts could help seal the deal. Thanks for the tip. The security camera on the roof was broken. Apparently we don't have footage of Shannon going up there, so. Sean, she was really careful when we went up there. Like she didn't want the two of us to be seen together. Does this mean that they're gonna rule it an accident? Possibly, unless we find evidence of motive and opportunity. Okay, so hypothetically, if we were to maybe have some evidence, like recordings of those guys assaulting women, will we be able to do anything with it? Even if the women don't say anything? Yeah, we would have to locate the women and confirm that it wasn't consensual. But if there are recordings of some kind, yeah, we can investigate them. And we could get all of them. I mean, Ethan, Jason, Marco. And Farrah. Honestly, she and Ethan would probably get the worst punishments. Would, would there be any way for Farrah to avoid that? You know, she might be able to get a lesser sentence if she turns in the guys to cut a deal. Okay. And if Farrah was assaulted, would that make a different? Would it make a difference if she was? Look, I mean, would it justify what she did? She's my only friend right now Sean, I really don't know how all this got so messed up. Hey, for what it's worth, I'm sorry for the role I've played in, putting in you in this position, but Farrah is not your only friend. Thank you for your help. Yeah. My gosh. All these women. Farrah, we have to stop it, you and me together. We can do it. - Hey. - Hey. Thanks for coming. Yeah. Listen I'm sorry that things got crazy the other night. I don't remember much, but I guess Ethan kind of hijacked you night. You know, Holly and Miranda, they don't remember much either. I guess we were really throwing them back. No, we really weren't. And I know that because I stopped drinking the second Ethan walked in. You know, you want me to tell you what happened or what was supposed to happen? But my guess is that you already know. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have come here. No, how many women have you met on this app? I don't know. Whose idea was it? Was it yours or was it Ethan's? I have to say it's very crafty. It's a great way to disarm women. It's not like that, okay. He just has to impress these guys and asked has for my help. - That's it. - No, he runs a date rape club. No, it's not, they're just hooking up. So all these women that he has all these indisposed pictures of, this is just hookups? I don't know what you're talking about. He has pictures of you too Farrah. He has pictures of you and all the women that you brought to him to be used. I'm sorry, okay. No, Ethan is a predator. And he used you too. Okay, he saw how unloved and how scared you were and he used that. Now you can stop him from doing that to anyone else. I can't turn him in. Yes you can. No, I can't. If I turn Ethan in, I'll go down with him. No you won't because you're a victim too. The police will see that. I don't know, sorry. Okay look, Farrah, when we first connected over books, we didn't read those stories because the people were perfect. We connected because they were real people who sometimes made mistakes, but along the way they made it better. You can do better. You can help us put him away. So he can't do this to anyone else. Okay. Okay? Okay. Okay. Do you have anything that we can use to incriminate him? Ethan gave me an envelope. He didn't tell me what was in it and I didn't ask. But I think it's drugs he uses on women. Is it Rohypnol? I think so. You know that's a banned substance. The fact that he has you hold it means he'd rather you get caught than him. Let's go get it. My girl. I put the envelope in my closet. Okay. So I put it in here. I'm gonna look upstairs, would you mind checking in here? Thanks. Hey, Farrah. Would it be in like some type of zip... Farrah. Ethan. You wanna help her because she's your friend. Don't hurt her. How many times, baby? How many times do I have to tell you not to make this more difficult? We got a good thing going. You helped me, I take care of you. Who else is going to do that, her? Or any of the other sluts you find online? Baby. If any of them really got to know you, they wouldn't stick around. But I will honey, I will always be there for you. If you just do what I tell you. So get up and help me get Andi to The Break, she has an admirer waiting for her and I'm not in the mood to be late. Uh-uh! It's the phone you sent my album to, right? Hey, this it? Give me a hand. Help me get Andi to the break. She's got an admirer waiting for her and I'm not in the mood to be late. Sorry man. Stay with her. Andi, Andi, are you okay? Andi, come on. Please be okay. Okay, I'm gonna get us out here, okay? Hey, I'm looking for my girlfriend. Have you seen her? Sorry man, I don't know. Sorry man, you don't. Sorry man, okay. Okay. Hey bartender, Evening Breeze. All right. Evening Breeze. Leaving so soon? You're such a spitfire, Farrah. - Thanks for your help. - Same. We'll leave you to it, she shouldn't be too much trouble. How about some privacy? No, you told him. And I told you I'd do what I have to. Shannon trusted you. She made a bad call. You're a monster, you're a monster! Get away from me! I guess you do have a spine. Hey! Get off of me. You're not gonna win this Andi. Stop trying. Please help me man, this crazy chick just attacked me. - Good. - What? - Good for her. - What? Good for her. Are you serious? Are you serious? Hey Andi, nice work on the proposal. Thanks man. Hey. Hey. What are you doing here? I wanted to tell you in person that you know, Ethan and the rest of those guys, they're being arraigned on assault and murder. I was reading the article. Look, if you want to talk, you know, my training basically is over. I have a few free days now, so I'm here now if you want. Only, only if you need. Yeah, that sounds nice. I like that. Cool. Cool. Hey, do you wanna grab lunch now or? Well now I actually have plans with my friends. Oh yeah, yeah, sure, sure. But next time. Well, you have my number. You think so? Life is far too short, take the chance. Fly to Greece, why not? I know. What's the hell's going on? I just trust me, please. - Why is she here? - Oh my God. Hey, Farrah. I don't think I can do this. Oh, you can do it. They'll hate me and they'll be right too. Okay, that is Ethan talking. So come, talk about it and everybody can heal, okay? Come on, wait right there. Um. I know that this is way too little too late, but um... I'm really sorry for what I did. I've dated bad guys too. They treated me badly and I did mental back flips to try to convince myself that it was my fault, not theirs. It messes with you. And no one deserves that, no one. - Yeah? - Yeah. Ethan told me he was a feminist. What? Yeah, I knew then he couldn't be trusted. To making them pay for it. And to Shannon. There's no tasteful way to transition out of that. Nope, there's not. How are your rehearsals going? Oh yeah, exhausting. This is my last day off for a few months. But, the numbers are dope though. Oh, I know you have some videos. What, you trying to get me sued? What we really want is tickets. Well, dare to dream lady.
