What can I say? Happy New Year! Babes, I love you so much! Even if you love your dogs more than I. I love you, Babe! Happy new year! Hey, no cheating! Go on! It's just my husband! It's no big deal. Are you sure? Shit. These pores are so big marbles could fit! Do we have astringent at home? What are you-- Stop it! I'm driving! You're too serious. What if we get into an accident? You know what I get after a few drinks? You understand me, right? Why won't you let me? You know when I drink beer, I get drunk. And I get so horny. You're worse than a sex maniac. No. Just stop the car. We used to do this all the time, right?! Please. Can't you see I'm driving? You really know how to turn a guy on. You're one of a kind. - Why are you sick? - Ma'am, she hasn't been eating-- - What happened? - She's having diarrhea. I don't know what to do. - She's been like that all day. - Has she been throwing up? No, ma'am, only severe diarrhea... I'm going up to the room. Tonet, bring me a glass of juice. Tonet! Sir? Juice, in my room! Yes, sir. What took you so long? I'm leaving. What? Tiffany is sick. I need to examine her blood. It could be serious. This won't take long. Trust me. Shit! It stinks! The dog has diarrhea. Problem with you is you know nothing about dogs. Parvo is serious and it could kill her in hours. Bullshit! I'm hard as a rock here. and all you can think of is that damned dog! What about me? - What about you? - Yes. Just jack off! Marie! What? You're pissing me off! Listen to me. It's New Year. Let's not fight, okay? Please? I said stop! Let go of me! Is your madam here yet? She's inside sir with Sir Darwin. Sir Darwin? The dog trainer. And you call him 'Sir'? Is he your boss? No, sir. Then why do you call him that? Out of respect, Sir. Just like I call you, Sir. Hey. Let's get one thing straight. I'm your boss. Understand? He's just a visitor. I'm your madam's husband. He just train dogs. That's the big difference. - Is that clear? - Yes, Sir. - Understood? - Yes, Sir. So there's no need to respect him. - Get it? - Yes, Sir. That's our girl. Chin up, Hannah. Chin up. I need to pee. When will that Darwin stop coming here? Why? Why? He's been training your shih tzus for a year and they haven't learned anything. What are you talking about? Poch knows how to play dead Powder has learned to fetch. You just don't like them so you don't notice a thing. Babes, will you be free tonight? If you want, we can have dinner? My presentation is at 6:00. I'll be done by 7:00. I could pick you up at 7:30. Then after dinner, we could go to a spa, come on. I can't. Tiffany is sick. I need to monitor her. Maybe next time. This is okay. #903 is okay. Okay. Really? Highlights for your hair? Yes. Dude, you're too much. Maybe this way, Marie will notice me, right? It's not working out. Maybe she's just upset about something? No. This is different. It's like... It's like she's lost interest in me. What do you mean not interested? She's keeps turning me down. You mean, she doesn't want to have sex with you? Oh, my goodness. Maybe it's just your timing. Screw timing, Dude. When we used to get horny, we'd do it anywhere it hit us. Now, I've been wondering what went wrong. I wonder what changed? Because, I still kiss the same way. The size of my dick is still the same. It's those bullshit dogs of hers. One day, I'm going to kill them all. And cook them into azucena. That's crazy. I'm serious, Dude. Don't. But, seriously. It's not just the sex. I want to have a kid. Did you tell that to Marie? She knows. What did she say? She said she's not ready. She's not ready? And you are? Shouldn't you have the last say? Marie. Look. I got highlights. Do you like it? Okay. Is that my dinner? It's for Tiffany. For your dogs again. Tiffany is sick. She can't digest well so she needs special food. What about my food? It's in the fridge. - Just microwave it. - No. Aren't you my dinner? You are. - You're my food. - Stop it! Leo! Let me go! You're not in the mood again? We're starting a family here, understand?! Before you give those dogs what they need-- take care of me first! - Got it!? - Leo! This one's really cute. Hey, Sir! What's wrong with it? It's got fleas, Sir. Your dog needs to be shampooed more often, Madam. Where's my wife? She's busy, Sir. She said she didn't want to be disturbed. If you like, I can take a message for you? You know what? I've left a bunch of messages on her answering machine but she hasn't returned a single message! None. She has not returned any. - Number 25 please! - Hey! - Sir! - Is she in there? Sir, she's going to be mad at us. Get out of the way! She's my wife, you hear? Sir! Please, Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir. My god! What are you doing here? I just want to talk to you, Marie. I bet you made a scene outside? Marie. Of all places, you had to confront me here? Because, you haven't been talking to me. We have nothing to talk about. Marie, we have a problem. Well the problem is about to be solved. We're splitting up! Splitting up--why? I quit. You quit? So, when you decide that you want to quit it, that's it? Just like that?! Why is it always your decision? In the house! In our bed! You are a selfish person! Are you done? Screw this, Marie! What have I done to deserve this? Why are you doing this to me? Babes! Babes. Babes. Babes. Come on, babes, please talk to me! Get out of here, Leo! Tell me what's wrong with me! Talk to me, please! - Please just talk to me! - I said I quit! You can't just say that! Says who? I don't want this anymore! I'm tired of this! But I love you. - What do you mean you love me? - Please, please I love you. You love your stupid nose more than-- more than me! And you? You love your stupid dogs more than you love me, right? Whether it's your nose or my dogs, whatever! We care about other things now. There's no love left for the both of us. So before we lose our respect for each other-- That's not true! That's not true at all! Babes. Babes, please. Babes. Babes. - Babes. - Don't you get it? I already have a lawyer. You should also get one. Then we'll talk. - Baby. - Stop! Don't you dare follow me! We're done. Sir? Please turn over. Marie. I just came to get my things. I missed you. How's Poch? And Powder, how are they? What about Tiffany? And you? How have you been? Have you had breakfast? Why don't we have breakfast? Antonet! I'll tell her to make breakfast, okay? Antonet! Please. Babes, don't leave me. Honey. - Put these in the car. - Baby. You asshole! That's my wife! Leo! Leo, what are you doing? Stop it! You want more? Babes. Babes, sorry. Did I hurt you? I didn't mean to. Sorry. Get away from me! Let's go, Darwin. Take me away from here. Him? That's why you're leaving me? There's nothing between us. He's just helping me move. Don't you accuse me of the crap you do! Screw you! What are you talking about? Babes! Babes! We really need to ta--! Shit! What's wrong with you?! That's how much I hate you! Dude, you're something else. Most guys I know when they have a problem--- they go to a bar to drink. But you're different. You go to the dermatologist. I'm different. Dude, this thing... It feels weird on my face. I don't want any of that face whitening stuff. My wife might not recognize me. Just relax. That stuff will dry up in 15 minutes. Miss, give the guy a magazine, will you? No, no, no. I'm okay. Fifteen minutes more? Dude, my face feels burning. Do you do this every week? I used to. Sometimes Marie and I would do this together. So how are you and Marie? That's the thing. I'm kind of worried. I'm afraid she'll never come back. Don't worry. She'll come back. Maybe she's just sorting out some issues. She'll be back. I don't know. It's been a week and she still doesn't want to talk. Maybe you're not giving her enough sex. Stupid ass! I told you, she keeps turning me down! See what I got for forcing the issue? She hit me with a blender! Blender... That's got to hurt. Look what it did to your face. Damn, man. It's not funny. Lighten up, will you! Stop worrying. She'll be back. Unless, there's something going on between her and Marvin. It's Darwin, stupid! But she keeps denying it right? You know, I know Marie. She wouldn't lie to me. How can she lie if she isn't talking to you? Dude, my face is so itchy right now. Antonet! - Antonet! - Sir! Didn't I tell you to wake me up at 6:00? Sir, I'm so sorry, I forgot. I'm going to be late for my convention. Did you make me coffee? Yes, sir. I'll just drink it in the car. Use my silver mug, okay? I will, sir. Good. Wait a minute. What are you doing? Sir, ma'am called earlier. She said to have these things delivered to the clinic because Poch and the other dogs need them. And sir, Veronica is about to give birth. - Veronica? - The shit shoo. Shit shoo? Did your ma'am look for me? No, sir. Has your ma'am arrived? Sir! Sir, how did you get in here? I found the brush! The gate wasn't locked. You forgot to lock the gate again. I'm not going to cause any trouble. I came to bring these. - Okay, Sir. - Is that Veronica? Yes, Sir! So she's about to give birth? That's why we're taking good care of her Alright, I'll be going. Please tell your ma'am that I came by. - We will, Sir. - Quick, lock the gate! And please tell her to give me a call. Yes, Sir. Because I keep texting her but she hasn't replied. - Okay? - Yes, Sir. - Get out of my way! - Sir. Sir, what are you going to do with the dog? Tell this to your ma'am. If she wants to see the dog, she'd better call me, okay? Hello! So you finally decided to call me. Leo, are you out of your mind? Bring Veronica back now! I should've known. This dog is all I needed to get your attention. Leo, that dog will give birth at any moment! What the heck? Why won't you talk to me? What have I done to you? You seriously have no clue? That's how dense you are? What are you talking about? You don't have any idea why I'm like this to you? As far as I'm concerned we're okay. Okay? Okay? You've been cheating on me all along! What are you saying? I don't understand you. Are you going to the house? Just wait for me there. Marie? Marie! Damn. So now what? What should I do? Why aren't you here yet? I'm already there! Hurry, please! Please! Move aside! Veronica? Oh, Veronica. Come on. Good dog. Veronica? There's one coming out. Leo. Quick hold this! What? - Good girl. - What will I do with this? Just keep it there. Make some space. Okay. Hold on there's one more. What? Another one is coming out. Here, take it, Leo. Carefully. Hold it. Okay. Just put it down beside you. Carefully. Good girl, Veronica. Good girl. Wait, there seems to be another one? - A third one? - Yes. There is a third one! Quick, get it! Okay... There it is, Leo. Babes. Marie. Don't leave me, please. I'm begging you. I love you so much. Happy birthday, Amber. Here, eat some. Who else? Here you go. Is she eating it? She doesn't want it. Now look at them. They've grown so big. - They love Papi. - They love me. Yes. I love you too. Wait, baby. You smell so good! My dress. - You look fine. - I'll be a mess! - I still have to go to the office. - Have you been a good girl lately? Have you been a good boy lately? I'm going to punish you! Dude, how can you say things are alright if you're not having sex? Just not often that's all. Really? So when was the last time? Seriously? That's none of your business, Dude. It's simple. As long as we are peaceful, I'm happy. Everything is okay. You should be happy for us. I don't know. What's your problem? Darwin, right? The guy you got jealous with Marie? So where is he now? Who cares? I don't see him anymore. Why'd you ask? Is he stocky? Has fair complexion? Something like that. So what? Dude. I saw Marie, two days ago. Where? In a restaurant. She was talking to some guy. He looked just like that description. I was going to say hello to her. But... But what? Dude, you know we've been friends for a long time. Believe me when I say that all I want is for you to be happy. Quit the crap. Just give it to me straight. What did you see? Well... It's nothing. See. You're such an ass! But, Dude. You know how it is when two friends talk, right? You'll feel something if, you know... You know what I mean, Dude? That guy I saw with Marie... Well, I don't know. Maybe I was just reading too much into it. But, their body language was different. You know. What do you mean... What do you mean, different? It just felt different to me, that's all. The thing is I don't want to ruin your marriage. But you're my friend. And I'd hate for you to be the last to know if your wife was making a fool out of you. You whore! I'm going to kill you! Happy New Year, guys! Kiss! Leo! It's okay. Just make it quick! Are you sure? Go on! It's just my husband! T'heart. Marie has really bad breath. What? - I said your best friend. - You're mean. Has bad breath. Such a beautiful woman but with bad breath. I wonder how Leo can stand it. That bad breath. Did I tell you how short Leo's dick is? Like this! Gabs, will you stop that? He got circumcised past his teens. At first, he didn't want to because was worried nothing would be left of his dick. Gabs, stop it! Now I'm shocking my wife. Come closer. What are you doing? Come give me a hug. I want a kiss. - Give me another one. - That's enough. - I want a French kiss. - You're driving. Kiss me. Just drive okay. - I don't want to get into an accident. - I just want one kiss, that's all. Are you okay? I'm okay. I'll just get a glass of water. Get me one too. Okay. This is the day that the Lord has made This is the day This is the day This is the day that the Lord has made I wonder why Leo refuses to give our shih tzus away. He used to hate those dogs. Well it's good he has finally taken a liking to them. Don't worry. I'll recommend you to a breeder. He doesn't charge much. Okay. Rita, are you okay? Why? I can't tell if it's just your makeup Or if you're just paler today. Look yourself in the mirror. Hurry, look. Do you go to the gym? What for? I don't need to. I haven't gained any weight, have I? You know, instead of moping around in your house, why don't you go back to writing? You've got a degree after all. You know, Marie. I'm a little rusty. Rusty? So what? You had a career as a journalist. I don't even know why you gave it up. You should give it another try even just part time. It's alright. I don't miss working anyway. What's wrong with you? Aren't you getting enough sex? What are you doing?! God. You're embarrassing me. Maybe I just mellowed down. You know, Cause I'm married already. If that what happens to all women after they get married. Then our pussies should close up as well. Calm down! My god, Marie. What has that Gabby done to you anyway? You've totally lost your drive. Are you still depressed? The doctor said you could still have another baby, right? I don't think about it anymore. I don't know. Maybe I'm just bored. Because you're not doing anything. You need a little excitement in your life. Why don't you try ballroom dancing? You might meet a handsome dance instructor? No thanks. I already have a hobby. Really? And what hobby is that? I collect different kinds of bandaids. Do you want me to pour this at you? You're mean. I had nothing else to do. You know, Son. Your mother, she was an amazingly beautiful woman in her time. She was always the queen of-- Gabs. - I should have carried that. - It's okay, Nanny. I'll go now, Son. I still have work to do inside. Thank you, Nanny. Okay. What happened to your finger? No. I used it because it was old. You going anywhere? I don't know. Maybe to the mall. What time will you be home? Would you like to see a movie? Let's just watch a DVD. Gabs, there's nothing like watching it on the big screen. I've still got so much to do. This will be a dick-boring day. Gabs! Watch your language. Oops. I'm sorry. How about this. Why don't you and Nanny watch a movie instead? Forget it. She'll just fall asleep in the cinema. Wake her up then. Come on. Gabs. When will you start the construction on our house? Why? Don't you like living in Mommy's house? - This house belongs to us now. - It's not that. It's just that it's kind of old, that's all. I'll have to take out a loan to start the construction. Gabs, you can do this. You're an architect. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Oh, yes. Benedict? - Shit! - Gabs! That should've been done last week! Problem is you don't check! Fine, I'm on my way. - I have to go. - Alright. How do I look? I told you, this place is muddy and stinky. I'm fine, Nanny. I'm really enjoying myself. Besides, I haven't gone to a wet market in a long time. I'd like to buy some fish, Nanny. Over there. Nanny, go check if these are fresh. We'll buy a kilo, okay? How much for a kilo of this? She wants to know how much for a kilo. One hundred sixty. One hundred sixty. One kilo. Ouch! What happened? I held it wrong. It's okay now. Thank you. It's nothing. How much? It's free. No, I meant the beef. One hundred sixty. One hundred sixty? What's that? Is that part of your collection? This one? Yes. So how was your day? It was okay. Yours? It was okay too. Hello? Hello, can I please talk to Gabby? - Nanny, this is Leo. - Sir Leo? Sir. It's Sir Leo. Please tell him I'm having dinner and I'll call him back later. Sir Leo, he is still eating. He said he will call you later. Please tell him it's an emergency. I'm at the precinct. Emergency? You're at the precinct? He says it's an emergency. Leo, what happened? Marie is dead. What?! Why? Okay. I'm on my way. What happened? Marie is dead. What?! Leo killed her. When? Marie. My daughter has left me. Here's the check. Please tell them I'm sorry. I won't make it to the medical mission. And here's the money for the carolers. For the carolers later. Give it to them. And these gifts are also for them. - Yes, Ma'am. - Okay. Did your sir leave yet? He left much earlier, Ma'am. And don't forget to give Poch and Powder their vitamins. And if there's ever an emergency, call me at the clinic, okay? Don't forget. Okay, Ma'am. Ma'am I found a piece of paper in the pocket of Sir's pants. It might be important. I found some money too. How much is that? Around two hundred, Ma'am. - Alright, just leave it there. - Yes, ma'am. Hold on, Antonet! Include this in the petty cash for the house. - Take care of everything, okay? - Yes I will, Ma'am. Isn't this a receipt for an ultrasound? Leo won't get himself an ultrasound! Why not? People with stomach problems get ultrasound tests too. Just like pregnant women get ultrasounds, right? I have a bad feeling about this. Marie, why don't you just ask Leo? I'm just waiting for the right time. Besides, I doubt he'll admit to it. So what are we going to do here? You'll talk to the doctors? I'm going to gather information. Marie, patient's files are confidential. They'll never give you information. Who says I'll ask for it? I'm going to buy them! Miss, where is your ultrasound section? Just go straight over there. Okay, thank you. Thank you, brother! Thank you. We'll see you next week. Marie! Marie! What do you have to say, Marie? What are you laughing so hard about? Why are you laughing? Why? Your fly is open! And your brief is pink! It's just my husband! Go on! My husband's kiss seems to have a terrible effect on you. Does your husband brush his teeth? His breath stinks! How would I know. We don't kiss. You mean you don't have sex? We have sex, but we don't kiss. It's very rare that we kiss, promise. At least you still have sex. Hold on, have you confronted him? Honestly, Rita, I don't want to talk about it right now. It's New Year and all that. Is Gabby's dick long? Is your husband's dick long? Marie! What kind of question is that? Did you know? Leo's is just like this. But he's a performer. What about Gabby, does he make the grade? He's alright. What's 'just alright'? Your husband's balls are huge, hanging from his pants. Marie! Though, looks like he can't last long in sex. What the-- Well as they say God is just. He doesn't give everything to someone. You know what? The problem with Gabby is after he... He comes fast! No! After he comes, he gets sleepy right away. Give him coffee then. Doesn't help. You've tried it, didn't you?! No effect! - Seriously? - Yes! I promise! I've tried that already. Oh, my gosh. What's with your husband? These pores just keeps getting bigger! So is my best friend a good kisser? What were you thinking? Warn me next time, will you? That stinks! You like dogs, right? You should be used to the smell. Chin up, Hannah. Chin up. Chin up. Chin up. Pretend that you're laughing. Please, just laugh. Come in, come in. Sister, how are you? Is that her? She looks so ordinary. She's not even pretty at all. She's pretty. Wait! Where do you think you're going? I want to talk to her. Marie. I won't make a scene. - Fine, I'll go with you. - No, you stay here! What if those born again people gang up on you? I just want to talk to her. Please, just stay in the car. Are you sure? Rita, I need to do this. Okay. Just holler if you need help. Come in please. We just started. - Are you with sister Grace? - No! I am Leo's wife. - Leo? - Ramirez. You know each other don't you? I was his account executive at the agency. Are you going to pick a fight with me? No. I just want to know what really happened. And how long your affair took. Six months altogether. From the time I entered the agency. Until I resigned. Ma'am, your husband was not at fault. I was the one who pursued him. He was good looking. Neat. Sweet. Did he got you pregnant? I had an abortion. I guess the Lord really meant for us to talk. I haven't been able to forgive myself. No matter how hard I pray, it's still not enough. I guess what I need is your forgiveness. So please forgive me. Mars, are you sure? We could go drinking if you want. You don't drink. For you I will, okay? No, thanks. I need to get home. Tiffany is sick. I have to monitor her. Mars, you need to release that. I don't feel like crying. Are you sure? Come here. Give me a hug. Just text me for anything, okay? - Take care. - You take care. - Call me okay? - Bye, take care now. We're starting a family here, understand?! Before you give those dogs what they need, take care of me first! - Got it!? - Leo! My face! My face! Sir, what happened to you? My face! Call an ambulance. Hurry! Sit. Up! Up! Up! Go, Hanna. Up. Up. Have a drink. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bother you. It's not like we're close or anything. I know I should be running to my best friend. But her husband is Leo's friend. And I don't want to involve them in our problems. Then I saw your calling card on the dashboard. So that's why I'm here. Marie, it's alright. It's okay. I'm wasting your time. Marie. Stop thinking that, okay? It's okay. It's not really a problem. I'm wasting your time. No, you're not. I'm wasting your time. No, Marie. You're not. - I'm wasting your time... - Hush, Marie. - You're not, okay. - I'm wasting your time... Marie. Are you angry? Marie, I'm sorry. I've been wanting to do this for such a long time. ...especially when Marie started to go cold on him. All of a sudden she just wanted to leave him. - Was he abusive to Marie? - No, not at all! He wouldn't hurt Marie, no matter how much she wronged him. In fact, there was one time when she hit him with a blender. That will be all, your Honor. So you rest your case, Counsel. Fiscal, do you have any cross? - No cross, your Honor - Alright. In that case, Mr. Witness Thank you very much. You're now excused. You may leave the witness stand. - Thank you very much, Mr. Witness. - Thank you. The defense is given five days during which to submit This formal offer of evidence and prosecution Is given the same amount of period during which to comment After which, if you so wish, you can submit your respective memoranda. And within fifteen days, and this case is submitted for resolution. Next case! Are you mad with me? Leo is my friend, so I have to be on his side. What about Marie's side? She cheated on Leo! Leo cheated on her first. Marie just got back at him. That's not true. I know everything that happened. Everything? How could you possibly know everything? Did you see what Marie had to go through with Leo? - Did you? - Look Gabby! He killed Marie. However you want to look at it he must pay for what he did. That's why there is Destierro. The lawyer said Destierro, right? What does Destierro mean? Destierro... He won't be imprisoned. But his movements will be limited. And he wont be allowed to go anywhere near Marie's relatives. Marie's relatives are from Cebu, right? So he just won't be able to go to Cebu. You're kidding, right? That's the law. So that's it? After he murders Marie that's all he gets? So what? If I also caught my wife fooling with another man I'd probably end up killing the guy. That's what Leo did. He killed Marie out of blind rage! Then you're both stupid! If you caught your wife having sex with another man that means that there's something wrong with you too! Maybe you don't know how to give good sex. Or maybe you treat your wives like they're just things! Wait a minute. Why are you being mad at me? Go ahead and side with your friend! As far as I'm concerned you're both crazy! What are you doing here? It's my favorite customer! What do you need? For Sinigang? Porkchop? Leg of pork? We have fresh meat today, Ma'am. Make a space. Make a space. Hi, my favorite customer. How good of you to come by. Can I have a kilo of that, please? Make sure you give me extra. Give me a good discount. Alright, how much... Screw traffic! You know, it took me two hours on the road. Damn MMDA. They keep changing the routes! Are they on drugs? And what's with turning EDSA all pink? It doesn't even look good. And these U- turns... I don't know what to think anymore. Son of a... You know what, I've been dick-bored all day! Damn. I'm pissed. Wait a minute, I stink from the heat. I'm sweating all over! I still stink! Here, will you take this outside! Ma'am. Ma'am? Ma'am! Nanny? What time is it? It's almost 4:00. Wait, why did you sleep here? I unintentionally fell asleep. Are you leaving now? Yes, our prayer group is attending the prayer healing of Fr. Joey. You know how it is, I'm an old woman and I have diabetes. Who knows, I might get healed there. I didn't know you were very active with that, Nanny. I have great fun there. You see, there's singing, dancing and sometimes even free food! Could I go with you sometime, Nanny? Of course. You know, I really enjoy it there. I feel like I am so close to God. Promise to bring me next time? You're always welcome there. - Hold on, let me just get dressed. - Okay, sure. Let us all say that we have heard the voice of our father... Our celebrant is Reverend Fr. Joey Faller... Hey! Hey, how are you? Do you need a ride? Come ride with me. It's difficult to get a ride from here. We rented a cab earlier. It should be on its way back. I doubt it will still come back for you. Look, so many people are waiting for a ride. - We don't want to bother you. - It's alright, come on. By the way this is my wife. Luisa. - Hello! - Hi - You sure it's okay? - Yes, please. We don't want to be a hassle. - Not at all! - Let's go Did you attend the healing earlier? Yes, I fainted, actually. You were slain then. Is that what it's called? Gaston. Rita. I love you! I love you. I love you, Rita. I love you, T'heart. T'heart. Look at Marie in this one. She's all drunk and funny. - Have you seen this? - No I haven't. Let's watch it together. - This is fun. - Gabs later, please. T'heart, you really don't want to watch? Gabs, I have to fix the sound system. We're going to use this tomorrow. What is that thing you're getting into now? - Isn't that some Satanist cult? - Of course not! I'll be outside okay. I just need to fix this. Think about what you're getting yourself into. Brother, sorry I'm late. There are more chairs over there. Have you met my brother-in-law? That's Eddie, he's a reformed addict... Ever since he joined us here he's been a changed man. Sister, let's have some snacks. I'll join you in a bit. Gaston, were you able to get the soda? I'm just on my way to buy all that. - Are you okay? - Of course, Sister. You probably aren't used to the cramped space. It's alright. We really take turns here. Right, Brother? Yes, we could have the next meeting in your house if you want. Sure. Come, Sister. Come get some food. Look, there's lasagna. - You'll be okay? - Yes, Brother. Thank you. You're sure? - Of course. - Alright then, take care. Thank you and take care too. - Hold on, Sister. - Yes? Luisa wrapped some lasagna for you to take home. No brother, please don't, Brother. Please, take it. Thank you so much! - Bye! - Take care now. - Hey. - Hi. Did your group succeed in making a cripple walk? That's all for tonight, Nanny. - Thank you, you can leave us now. - Alright then. I have some lasagna, you want some? - Fix it for me. - Alright. - Can I eat this cake? - Yes. - Wait! - What? It's gone bad. Maybe you can just pray over it. Then it'll be good as new. Damn. Damn. Oh, Lord. We believe in you. With your power, nothing is impossible. Yes, Lord. We beg you. We praise you Lord, we glorify you, oh Lord. Please heal our Sister Luisa. Yes, Lord. Please lighten the burden of our problems. Lord, yes, Lord. Lord, we beseech you... Please continue singing the song and you may take your seats. - Let's not move. - Alright. Let's go get some candles. You're right, let's go look for some candles. Come on, Ma'am. Maybe it's just a fuse... I know how to replace a fuse. Nanny, how can this be a black out? The lights are on in the other houses. You're right! Maybe it's the main switch that blew a fuse. What if... I go check it out. Yes, please, Nanny. Thank you. Maybe its time to send your visitors home? Are they going to be here often? You're not turning our house into your headquarters, are you? Gabs, just go to our room, please. Gabs, what are you doing? Do you need some help? Sister Rita's house is so huge. Why don't you take a rest first. I'm going to take a shower. It's really hot. I'm sorry. - What do you think you're doing? - Maybe I'm just jealous. Lately, you seems to have more time for that El Shaddai than you do for me. Please let me go. I'm tired. In this case, the accused contends that he killed his wife under exceptional circumstances as provided under article 247 of the revised penal code which reads-- 'Article 247: Death or physical injuries inflicted under exceptional circumstances any legally married person, who having surprised his spouse in the act of committing sexual intercourse with another person shall kill any of them or both of them in the act or immediately thereafter or shall inflict upon them any serious physical injury shall suffer the penalty of Destierro.' Under Article 247 of the revised penal code. The killing of the wife by the husband or vise versa Is justified if the husband kills her while engaged in a sexual intercourse with another man or immediately thereafter. As the restrict application, Article 247, People versus Wagas teaches that-- The vindication of a man's honor is justified because of the scandal an unfaithful wife creates. The law is strict on this. Authorizing as it is the man to chastise her even with death. Wherefore, accused Leo Ramirez y Cordero is convicted and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of Destierro. You, Leo Ramirez y Cordero shall be precluded from entering the place or places designated in this judgment or within the radius therein designated which shall include a distance of 25 kilometers at least and 250 kilometers at most from the place designated. So ordered. I love her so much, Dude. I know, Dude. What are your plans now? Well... Rest, maybe. Go somewhere far. And visit the dermatologist, Dude. You ass! Dude, how's Rita by the way? She's okay. Is she still angry? Dude... Marie was her best friend. Of course she has no sympathy for you. I hope someday she'll forgive me. I'm sure of it. Especially now. She's active in prayer meetings. She'll find it in her heart to forgive you eventually. Prayer meetings? I know even I'm having a hard time adjusting to it. Rita has always been religious. But now, it's like she's some sort of fanatic. Too much for me. No you go first, please. What are you doing. Woah. Our blessing is here! I thought you guys weren't going to make it. Yes we're starving. Enough already with the complaints... Hi. Let's eat. Now let's see what blessing you brought. - Please eat, everyone. - Wow! Go ahead and eat. You go first. - Good afternoon, Sir. - Yes, what is it? We are from the prayer group. Sorry, Rita isn't here right now. Do you have a message for her? No sir, you're the one that sister wants to talk to. May I sir? Even for just a short while? Your wife is cheating on you! Gaston has been doing the same thing to me for quite some time. But I just let him... because of my condition... I can't give him what he wants. What is it, Gabs? What? Nothing. But Gabs, you've been staring at me. Just ignore me. To be fair, women like Rita are of help to my situation. To prolong my relationship with Gaston. But it's not fair for someone. And that someone is you. Hey, Gabs. This coming Saturday, our prayer meeting with my group mates will be held here again, alright? Gabs, are you okay? I'm okay. I just have a headache. It should go away soon enough. They do it in every house we go to... in every corner where they can They do it. Yes. I know this. Because Gaston has done this with other women before. So tell your wife. She isn't the first and neither will she be the last. Tell her, she gambled... on the wrong man. I'm just meeting with someone. I'm actually looking for... Found him. He's over there. Thank you. - Do you have it? - Here. With complete papers. Are you sure about this? I'm not going to prison for this, right? All I need to do is catch them in the act, before I kill them both. Destierro! Dude, what happened with Marie was different. I didn't plan that. But you, you actually want to set them up? Dude, my wife fooled me. Over and over! Even in my own house! If there's anyone who should understand, that should be you. But if you don't want to help me, then don't. Hold on. Fine. Does that have papers? Yes. This is clean. We'll just make it appear like I asked you to keep it for me. Yes, that's what we'll say. That you asked me to keep it for you. Unfortunately, when I caught those two in the act. I used your gun out of blind rage. Oh no, another black out? There must be someone here who brings bad luck. Most probably so. Let's go on with the sharing. The second gift that I received from the Lord-- is my husband was promoted as manager! Praise the Lord. That's why we're so thankful. And the third gift is my older sister who resides in the US... just came back home. Hallelujah! Brother? Where is your switch box? Are you okay? Sister?! Brother-in-law!? Son of a bitch! Our next prayer meeting will be next Friday in the house of Sister Lala in Tandang Sora, Quezon City. We hope to see you all there. God bless all. What happened? Brother, what's wrong? Sis! Sis! How could you! How could you! How could you! Why!? Water! Water! Water! You animal! - You have no respect for me! - Brother! Enough! Enough, Brother Eddie! You animal, you have no shame! Brother. Luisa... There's your wife. So, I'll be waiting for you outside. You'll be fine. Everything will be okay. Alright. Thank you for coming to visit me. We haven't had a chance to talk since the last hearing. What is there to talk about? By the way, our savings came up to three million. I'm giving half to your mother. Your other stuff, I gave to the rest of your family. Give me the contact number of your lawyer so that he can talk to my lawyer... about our annulment. Gabs, have you forgiven me? Does it matter? We're talking about our annulment. What's the point of asking me if I've forgiven you? Gabs, I can learn to handle the life in here. But what I can't handle is having to think night after night-- just how much I have wronged you. How much shame I brought to your family and mine. Gabs, this is important to me. I won't be able to forgive myself until you've forgiven me. Please, forgive me. Gabs... Forgive me. Alright then. If that's what will give you peace. I forgive you. But it doesn't mean that I'll forget what you've done to me, Rita. I will never forget that, Rita. Thank you, Sir. You'll be fine. - Hey, love's a bitch, right? - You said it. You'll be fine. Let's go.
