Shane! Son of a bitch. Where is he? Relax. Bet that's him. Late on his first day. The balls on this fuckin' guy. Hi, there. Special Agent Justin Rosa. Here for wire room duty. Got an ID, Special Agent? Yes, I do. Let's take a look at that. Well, you're definitely not new. How can you tell? Your photo. I'm guessing that's what, 20 years ago? Good eye, 18. But thanks for noticing. Well, I can tell there's a good story here, but, uh, considering you're about ten minutes late for your shift, guess you'll have to fill me in some other time. - Yeah. Will do, will do. - Know where you're goin'? - Fourth floor, right? - Got it. Friday night's slow around here. Let us know if you need something. - I will. Thank you. - All right. Hey, sorry I'm late. I couldn't find any... I didn't ask. Shut the door. That's rule number one. Okay. Okay. Hi, there. I'm Agent Justin Rosa. How you doin'? Don't talk to her. She's busy. You must be Special Agent Mueller. I'm your new transfer. It's Senior Special Agent. I know who you are, and I know what you are. Eh, look, I'm sorry I'm late. I don't have access to the garage yet. I had to park like six blocks away. Who knew downtown could get so busy on a Friday? Yeah, no shit. No excuses. You're not allowed. Understood. Understood. Yeah, you look a little old... for a rookie. Yeah. I started out in Secret Service. But to be honest with you, it was a little boring. I wanted a little more action, so I figured I'd try this. Action? Yeah, there is no action. Well, I've never been in a wire room before, but if this is what one looks like, then, uh, you guys must have a pretty good case. Huh? It's a shit case. - You know what a wire room is? - Yeah, yeah. You want the textbook definition? - Sure. - Yeah, a wire is a lawful interception of telephonic and internet based conversations of subjects under criminal investigation. You memorized this whole thing? Yeah, I did, yeah. From that little pamphlet. Your knowledge doesn't matter. You want to know why? Uh, let me guess, one of your rules? Nope. Why doesn't matter? Tell him. Because you are nothing more than a warm body here to make sure the place doesn't burn down. Exactly. Don't fuck anything up. What, so that's it? You're not gonna brief me on the case? It's a gun-smuggling case with the cartel. - Which one? - Does that matter? Well, yeah, 'cause if we're talking about the Baja cartel, they control all the smuggling routes in and out of California. So if that's the one you're talking about, then we're good. Yeah, well, maybe you're not a complete idiot. The Baja cartel. This is our guy. That's Eddie Flynn. That's Eddie Flynn, huh? That's him. - Huh, this guy right here? - Yep. So this is what a shit case looks like, huh? If you ask me, it looks like someone put a lot of hard work and money into this. And that is just unbelievable. That's your entertainment. She's the expert. I'm the expert on all of it. So, these screens are tied into two sets of CCTVs... One for the federal building and these are from Eddie's compound. We have most of the inside and all of the outside monitored. So he can't take a shit without us knowing the color. It's brown. Each camera is recorded to a hard drive, that way you can rewind, pause. You ever see anything good on there? Nope. Just like the wire. Nada. Who knows? Yeah, maybe you'll get lucky. Yeah, get some actual activity. However, we never turn the channels off of Eddie's CCTVs. They are triggered by facial recognition tech. Impressive. Don't get too excited. It's worthless. And that's about it for the TVs. Now, if you don't mind, I'd really like to get back to my actual job. Can I go, or do you have more questions for me? Um, what if I want to leave? If I gotta, you know, go pee or something? You don't. That's rule number two. Well, what are the other rules? You're a real special agent now, huh? Yeah, you'll figure it out. Uh, the rest are in the blue binder. - Okay. All right. - Read 'em. Nour Holborow, the analyst assigned to the case. Hi, Nour. Well, that went well, huh? Don't let him get to you. He's three months from retirement. He's not always that friendly? Shane? He used to be one of the coolest agents around. - Oh, yeah? - Fun-loving, laid back, charming. One of the best. Fucking rock star. What happened? Well, it started as a swan song, you know. One last case to hang his hat on, but didn't quite turn out that way. And now he's just trying to make it these last few months, so he can collect his pension, call it a career. So is this case that bad? I mean, it had legs early on. Shane had a CI in the organization who was feeding us great intel, but he went dark several months ago. Is that normal? Mm, there's nothing normal about CIs. Anyhoo, Eddie Flynn is an infamous Irish arms dealer. Smuggled Russian-made weapons into shipments bound for the South American rebels. Ended up on the run after a bloody gang war. Made his way to the US. And now is biding his time as a middleman for the Baja cartel. - Ah. - Still using his arms and dope connections to survive. And that is his number two, who we've yet to identify other than a nickname of Junior. Junior. We tracked a few of their shipments, but once the CI disappeared so did the guns, and it's been quiet here ever since. Nothing but a bunch of coded talk and calls to numbers that drop the moment they hang up. Eleven wasted months. All right, let me show you how everything works so I can get out of here. So, program is always on. And you'll know someone is either making or receiving a call - when you hear three beeps... - Yeah. Three beeps. ...and a dial tone. Once the call connects, it will play in real time. And here is the audio waveform visualizer, or AWV. It's basically a computer-generated image of the audio recording. Okay. But for today, you won't need to worry about any of that. Eddie doesn't make calls before midnight. A criminal with a schedule. I like it. Ah. And if a call does come in, the program automatically records and stores it for review and evidentiary purposes. So nothing to do but count the minutes until shift change. Completely agent-proof. All right. Speaking of shift change... - Think you got it? - Yeah, it's completely agent-proof. What could go wrong? Good luck, Special Agent Rosa. Thank you, Nour. - Good night. - Have a good night. Senior Special Agent Shane Mueller. Smoke 'em if you got 'em. All right. Let's look at those fucking rules, huh? "Rule one: Keep the door closed. Two: Don't leave the room unattended. Three: No one other than HSI personnel are allowed in. Four: Don't destroy wire room. Five: Never contact the target. Six: Keep the target alive. Seven: Don't fuck anything up. Eight: If you have any issues, questions or emergency, the only number you should call is Shane." All right. Let's get into it. Oh! Hey, it's me. Yeah. Can you get me the same again? The chicken dumpling. And the special sauce. Don't be late. Eh, call before midnight. All right. Here. Can't be good if you're calling this late, boss. We had to terminate one of the babysitters. How quickly can you find me another one? - The White girl? - - Nah, the Chinese girl. - How quickly do you need one? - Quickly. Talk to Marsh, he'll fill you in on it. Why are you dressed like that? What's that, boss? Not you, hold on. What, we don't look sexy enough? - Where do you think you're even going dressed like that? - Out. And you're taking us. Oh, no. No chance, darling. Please? Just today. I won't ask again. Right. Until the next time. You need to take better care of my girl. You already know me answer. - Such a prick. - Paranoid prick. I'm getting really tired of having to explain myself every fucking time you talk back. Nor do I appreciate being called prick in me own home. Well, then don't act like one. You always do this. All because you think someone wants to kill you. You're not that important. Seriously. You know what I do. And who I am. This is the only place I'm safe. So take your sweet little asses back upstairs, put your pajamas on, we're staying in. I'm not. - You want me to call back? - Did I say I wanted you to? 'Cause if I did, I'd say so. Hold the line. Upstairs. - Upstairs! - Fuck that! Cindy... do I need to raise my voice again? Go change. Go upstairs. You know, you're right. Someone does want to kill you. It's me! I'll add you to the damn list, you fucking floozy! Call Ma. Find me a babysitter. What's the story? This guy's life's a fucking soap opera. All right. Uh-huh. Right. Okay. Okay, yeah. What do I pay you for? Fucking useless. Hey. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Shit. Didn't mean to scare the piss outta you. Just doing my rounds. - Officer... - Axum. Call me Mike. - Hey, Mike. How you doin'? - Good. Pleasure. Yeah, pleasure's mine. You know, how is it you've been around here for 18 years, but I've never seen you before? Well, there's not much to tell, really. You know, I started out with Secret Service and... yeah, I just thought I'd mix it up a little bit. Yeah, no, I get that. I was a deputy with the sheriff's department for 20 years. - No shit. - Yeah. Yeah, just retired a few months ago. - Hey, congrats. - Thank you. Took this gig here purely out of boredom. What, this isn't boring? Well, to be perfectly honest, keeps me out of the house a little bit between the wife and the boys. Yeah. How about you? You married, kids? No. Divorced. No kids. Eh, you know this line of work. It ain't easy. No, no, it's not. What kind of case you guys working on in here? It's nothing too exciting. Guns, drugs, as far as I know. I'm the new guy. - Same old shit, huh? - Yeah. Well, looks like you're busy. Let me let you get back to work. - All right, Mike. - I'm gonna take care of my rounds. - All right. - Okay. - Hey, Mike, uh... - Yeah. Hang on one second. What is it? Where's the bathrooms around here? Can you show me where they are? Yeah, let me show you. Gets a little confusing. Prostate's gigantic nowadays. - Holy shit. - I should a wore my Depends. I didn't know I was gonna be stuck in an office all day. Come on, man, I'll take you there. Thanks, man. I don't know why you put up with him. I can do better, I know. Let me guess... he loves you. Does he say that when he's drunk or sober? That's what I thought. No! No! Junior, come on. One time I need you. You useless Yank. Where are you? At the tone, please record your message. Come down here, Junior. Someone's come for me, where are you? Fuck! Come down here, Junior. Someone's come for me. Where are you? Fuck! Oh, Jesus Christ. - Cin, is that you? - I don't wanna die. Tell me where you are. They have me downstairs on the couch. Okay, okay, okay. Listen... They're here for me, not you. You do whatever they say, and I'm gonna come find you. I promise, it's gonna be all right. They're gonna kill me, I know it. Please... Cindy! Cindy! Fuck! Fuck. You fuckers. What the fuck? - Hello. - Shane, it's Justin. - Who? - Justin. Justin Rosa. - From the wire room. - Oh, shit. - What do you want? - Hey, look, Eddie already made some phone calls. - And there's... - Who did he call? Well, the first one I don't know. Some guy about firing the babysitter and hiring some Chinese girl. Those are code words for drugs. Fentanyl, stash house. The other two calls went to Junior, but they went right to voice mail. Did he leave messages? Yeah, he said get some guys and come to the house. Did you read the folder? The ones the binder? Yeah, yeah, I read the rules. - Did you get it? - Yeah, they're pretty much self-explanatory. Obviously not. You damn broke the last one. Fucked up my day. Hey, there's a bunch of guys over there right now. There's some kind of a seat... Hello? Fucking prick. - Looks like one of those days, huh, Shane? - Yeah. You need to train hose recruits better. Tell me about it. - Well, next round of drinks is on me. - If you can afford it. Hefeweizen, not any of the American slop. Deal. All right. Okay. All right, think, Justin, think. - Hello? - Special Agent Rosa, this is Nour. Oh, Nour, thank God. Hey, look, there's... I think I forgot my PIF there in the room. Could you check around for it? Okay, uh... what's a PIF? It's our access card for the building, parking, the wire room. And if we lose them... Okay. Yeah, yeah, I got your PIF. Hey, look, Eddie already made a bunch of calls. - Who did he call? - Look, that's not important right now. There's a bunch of guys in there, and they got his wife, or his girlfriend or wherever she is, and they're looking for him right now. I mean, these guys are like military or they're SWAT or something. It's hard to tell. Shit, Rosa, why didn't you lead with that? Give me a sec, I can log in remotely from my laptop. If they are SWAT, I'm gonna be pissed. I cleared that address. If any other law enforcement agency runs it, I should have been notified immediately. Unless they didn't clear it, and in that case, I bet it's the DEA, because those assholes never clear shit. Okay, I'm logged in. Let me zoom in. They don't look like law enforcement. Have you notified Shane? Well, I tried to. I called him, but he hung up on me before I could explain. Dick. All right, I'm on my way back to the wire room. Call Shane back, let him know what's going on. Hey, Nour. Just real quick, uh... Shane's rules, that one about keeping the target alive? What's that about? It's driving me crazy. Remember that CI I mentioned earlier? He told Shane that Eddie has a list of dirty cops who work for the cartel. They export loads, run checks on databases, stuff like that. Eddie keeps it as his get out of jail free card. And Shane hopes if he can arrest him, he can be used to go out on top. You know, take down the shit bag and the dirty cops. The problem is, the list is in Eddie's head. Okay, so Shane needs him alive. Exactly. Well, how the hell do we keep him alive from in here? We can't. Call Shane. Shit. All right. It's Shane, you know what to do. Hey, it's Justin. I just wanted to let you know that there is a group of armed men at Eddie's house. I just spoke to Nour, and she's on her way back in, and she thought you might want to do the same. Uh... That's it. Okay. Bye. Fuck you! Tell your fucking friends. He just killed him. Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. 999-555-2183 is not available. At the tone, please record your message. When you're finished recording, you may hang up or press one for more options. Goddamn it, Junior, someone's come for me. Where are you? Shit! It's my fucking men. It's my men coming after me. If I find out he sent them, I'll chop him up into dog treats. Come on, Eddie. Come on. Turn around, you dumb fuck. Fuck... Fuck it. Answer it, goddamn it. Answer it. About time you called back. Hello, you there? There's one right outside your door. He's coming your way. Quit playing, I don't time for this. Hey, listen to me, asshole! He's coming from your left! - There's no one there, you lyin' piece... - Your other left! Okay. Let's talk. Who the fuck are you? You still there? Fuck. Oh, my God. Oh, my... Sheriff's office. Is this an emergency? Yes, it is, uh... I need to speak to the on-duty supervisor. May I ask who's calling? Special Agent Justin Rosa of Homeland Security. Hold, please. This is Sergeant Roberts. Yes, look, uh... This is gonna sound little strange, but we're on a T-3 right now, and the target of our investigation is under attack. Under attack? What do you mean? Well, some men broke into his house, and it's-it's a complete war zone out there. Okay, and what would you like for me to do about that? - Well, if you could send the cavalry. - Right. And may I ask, how come you guys aren't doing that right now? Well, that's my next call, but if you could please just send a unit out there. - What's the address? - It's, uh... 903 Lake Point. That's I as in Lima, A as in alpha... Nine-0-3 Lake Point. Got it. All right, I'll send some guys up. Thanks. Hey, um, any chance you can give me a follow up call? Well, if you're on a wire, - wouldn't you find that out? - Maybe, maybe. You're new, aren't you? - Yeah, is it that obvious? - Yes. But I know a few of the HSI guys and your name didn't ring a bell, so... Yeah, it's my first day. Wow. Wire room duty on your first day? Lucky me. Well, I look forward to seeing you face-to-face at some point. Same here, Sergeant. Thank you. Shit. You've reached Homeland Security Investigation Special Agent Justin Rosa. Please leave a message. Special Agent. Aren't I lucky? Well, Mr. Rosa, I don't know why you called me, but your number is now in my cell. And I can hide from these goons easy. But if I die tonight, someone is gonna wonder why a Special Agent from Homeland Security be callin' me. And that's not gonna look good on your resume, is it? So we need to chat, sooner the better. Call me. You are one annoying fuck, you know that? I know. Uh, look, did you get my message about the people at Eddie's? People? - What people? - I don't know who they are, but, uh, I-I called Nour, and she's on her way back in. - She is? - Yeah. Uh, look... Eddie got into a fight with a guy and he killed him. - Eddie's dead? - No, no, Eddie... Eddie killed the guy. He blew his brains out. - What the fuck? - But don't worry. - Don't worry. I got it under control. - How? - I talked to the sheriff's department... - Why would you do that? Christ. Dirty cops are everywhere. Don't worry, I talked to the supervisor - and he sent a unit out there. - Don't you call anyone else. - You hear me? No one. - Yeah, um... About that, - I, uh... - You called him, didn't you? - You called Eddie. - Hey, your fucking rule said to keep him alive. What was I supposed to do? I was wrong. You are an idiot. A complete idiot. I did what I thought was right for the case. - I couldn't just let him die, right? - You listen to me. You plant your ass on the couch. Don't you dare move. Not till I get there. You got that? - Yeah, yeah. - Oh, yeah. - This can't get any worse. - Uh... Jesus fucking Christ. You're gonna tell me how, aren't you? Well, when I called Eddie, I used my cell phone, so now he's got my number, and he has since called me back. Of course he has. - Did you answer? - No, no, I didn't answer. Call the sheriff's office. You tell him you're wrong. - Okay. - Make something up. Hey, Special Agent Rosa. It's Mike. Oh, hey, Mike. - This fuckin'... - Just checking in on you, man. - Doin' okay up here? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just trying to keep the place from burning down. You know? - Not much else you can do on wire room duty, huh? - Yeah. Especially considering you're not the, uh, case agent. These guys, they get pretty territorial about that kind of... Mike, I hate to be rude, but, uh, I got a really important phone call... Yeah. No, my-my apologies. I've been known to drone on and on. Wife and kids always get on me about it, you know. Hey, look, maybe could shoot the shit later, okay? - I gotta... - Hey, deal. - All right, bye. All right. - Listen, man, if you need any help or anything like that, I'm here. - I'm good. Thank you, Mike, I appreciate it. - Good? All right. - Sure? - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, good. - Hello? - Special Agent Rosa. Yeah, hey, Sergeant Roberts, I was just about to call you. Uh, apparently, I made a mistake. There is no attack on our target. Well, actually, that's why I was giving you a call. Your target... that's Eddie Flynn, right? Yeah. How'd you know that? Well, the address seemed familiar. So we ran it through our database here and come to find out a few of our detectives are investigating him also. Well, if you could have your men stand down for now, I'd-I'd appreciate that. Well, knowing my guys, they'll probably do a welfare check regardless. Actually, seems like they're on the scene right now. Hey, uh, hold on for a second. Let me put you on hold. Yeah, no problem. We got this covered. Hey, it's good to see you, man. How you doing? Special Agent Rosa? You there? Yeah, yeah, I'm still here. All right, well, I'm glad my guys cleared the scene. Everything's code four. They did a standard routine check around the house. No one's home. So, looks like you were right. Nothing's going on. All right, well, I appreciate it, Sergeant. Hey, anytime. And if you need anything else, you just give me a call. Will do. You've reached Homeland Security Investigation Special Agent Justin Rosa. Please leave a message. Special Agent Rosa? We both know these gobshites aren't leaving 'til I'm dead. Which may not be much longer. It's gonna be very bad for you when someone finds your number in my call log. Basically, your career's fucked. So pick up. How many of you fuckers are cops? Mr. Rosa. You gotta stop calling me. Why would I do that? You saved my life. Plus, I really wanna know why a Fed called to warn me. And more importantly, how you knew. Are you watching me? Are you one of these gobshites out here trying to kill me? - No. Those were sheriffs. - Sheriffs? Was it Roberts? How the fuck do you know Roberts?! I don't, I sent a unit out there because I thought I saw... Saw? Are there fuckin' cameras here? Huh? Have you got a spy satellite over my base? Can you see this, can ya? Huh? Fuckin' have some! Or maybe you're watching me through my phone. Is that it? You listenin' to me? If you are, you're wasting your fucking time. I don't use my phone for anything business-related. Nobody's listening to you. Nobody's watching you. You're not that fucking important. Clearly I am. Otherwise, why'd you call and warn me? I told you, it was a mistake. Doesn't change the fact that you did. And I have no idea how you knew, but I will figure it out. You're fucking crazy. You know that? Yeah? Let's see how fuckin' crazy I really am! Sheriff's office. Is this an emergency? Peter Roberts, please. May I ask who's calling? - No. - Is this an emergency, sir? It isn't yet, but the clock's ticking, darling. - Put me through. - Hold, please. - Roberts. - You piece of shit. Eddie? Surprised I'm still alive, are we? What? No. You're not calling me from your cell, are you? - No. - Good. That's good. Okay, so why are you calling me at work? I've called you around a dozen times tonight, but you never answered. I don't answer that cell at work. You know that. No, you don't answer when someone else calls, but if it's me, you fucking answer. Look, I can't talk right now, okay? I'm not alone. Funny, neither am I. Get alone. I'll wait. So, what's so urgent that you couldn't wait until after I got off work? Let's start with the army of men you sent to kill me. Army of men? I have no idea what you're talking about, man. Don't, Junior. Junior. I know it was you who orchestrated all of this. What I want to know is why. Why? Why, why, why? Because you put our organization at risk. That's why. Allowed a snitch to infiltrate your little enclave. Do you know how much intel he probably got? None of it important. You don't know that. I had to deal with it, not you. Now I have to clean up the other messes. One of which is you. And you'll be dead by morning. Is this little plan of yours approved down south? Didn't think so. And if you think I'm a problem... just wait. You're out of your league. Or do I have to remind you the last time you got kicked out of town, like a little rat? You lost your empire, tucked tail and ran like a little bitch. Now you're just a paranoid lackey. A middleman. A reject. I'm the king. I'll own this town. You don't got shit on me. Without me, this entire ship goes down like the Titanic. You hear me? I'll cook you like the chickenshit you are, you fuckin' weasel! I could see it in your eyes all along you were gonna fuck me! You think your bitch boys can succeed in their mission? - Huh? - Oh, absolutely. Without a doubt. Is that a promise, sweetheart? Then please tell me why two of them are dead, and I'm still breathing! Oh, and Sergeant Roberts... I am using my cell, which is being monitored by the Feds! But I think you already knew that, didn't you? Shit. Peggy! Let's fucking go. How's that for crazy, Special Agent Rosa? You have my number. We have a lot to discuss. Thanks for confirming you're listening to my calls. And that probably means there are cameras in here. Which would explain how you saw something. There's nothing there. You're just being paranoid. Is that right? We'll see about that, won't we? Come on. Come to Eddie. Yeah. You crafty little bastard. Fuckin'... How many more of these are there? Eh? You really want to know? I hope you've enjoyed everything you've seen so far, because mostly like your wire room, these are nothing but a waste of your time. I'm hanging up. Erase my number, forget we ever spoke. And what's that gonna fix? If it's your job you're worried about, don't. I gave you Junior. He's a high-ranking, well-respected member of law enforcement. Probably be awarded some sort of medal. But we'll have to survive the night first. So, are you ready to go to war, Mr. Rosa? What does that mean? If I know Junior, which I do, he'll be coming after you and your evidence. Yeah, he's really gonna attack a federal building? It's too risky, and for all he knows, we have nothing on him. No, for all he knows, you have everything. Which threatens that perfect little life of his. So he'll be coming after you. He'll be coming fuckin' hard. Yeah, well, he can't get up here. Too well protected. Who're you trying to convince? We got guards here, armed guards. Six, right? They're Junior's guys. The only difference between you and me, is they don't know where I am. No. These are our guys. After everything today, are you still that naive? What the fu... Mikey, what the hell? Fuck, man, I told you to get out of here. What's going on? Well... looks like there's been a, uh, small... change in plans. What the fuck?! Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, guys, easy. Weapon discharged, it's okay. It's okay, it's all under control. Relax. Relax, relax, guys. Got it all under control. I'll let you know if I hear anything else. All right? You guys have a good night. I'll see you in a little bit. It's Shane. You know what to do. Shit. - Yeah? - One of the SUVs just left. Guessing they're coming for you. Looks like we're both up shit's creek. Yeah, that's really helpful. Thanks. Now don't lose hope, Agent Rosa. You know the playbook. Right now they're gonna try and use my girl as insurance. Let's see how far they get. It's time for me to bring out my fucking toys. Aye. We're gonna have some fun. I like playing. Do you? Are you ready? It's fucking time. Focus on what's coming your way. I can handle the rest of them here. Oh, yeah? Like you handled that guy that snuck up on you earlier? Why do you care if I live or die? I took an oath to protect and serve. I know that might sound corny to you. But that's something I believe in. Touching. Truly. All right, we're gonna focus on you first. I'll deal with my shit as it comes. And just how do you plan on keeping me alive from wherever you are? All right, I'm gonna be your eyes. You just need to trust me and listen to me. You think you could do that? You're not a good listener. Any other option? Not if you want to get out of here in one piece. Such a fuckin' cliché fact, you know that? Okay, let's begin. All right. What have we here? Okay. You got three of them by the garage. But you can't just go in there with your AK, it's too loud. I think I got something for that. Wow, Eddie! You do know that's an illegal firearm, don't you? Well, I don't always play by the rules. I'm ready. Okay, he's heading your way. Hide, hide, get down, go! All right, just stay there. He's coming around. Just stay there. He's coming around the front of the truck. On my mark... Now. What was that? That's one down. Nice shot, Eddie. Okay, you got a couple headed your way. Okay. All right, all right. Stay there. Stay right there. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Stay there. Good, they're moving around the front of the truck. All right, on my mark. Now. Very nice. Very nice, Eddie. That makes three. All clear. Hello... Junior. How about we handle this diplomatically? Shall we? And how do you propose we do this? You simply delete any evidence you have on me. - Mm. And what's in it for me? - I'll let you live. Well, that's very nice of you, Junior. What more could you want? Nothing... from a piece of shit, dirty cop like you. You know, you're very brave for a man who's all alone. Oh, I'm not alone. - There are other agents in here. - Ah, come on. Now, you and I both know that's not true. - Yeah. - But my guys are. So what, are you gonna send your rent-a-cops in here to attack a secure wire room? You mean a wire room that my rent-a-cops have the keys to? No, no, no. Cindy, is that you? She can't come to the phone right now. Fuck you, cunt. Let her go. You're here for me. Please, help me! Baby, baby... This is taking too much time as it is. So you know how this goes. Come out, she lives. You don't, she dies. You won't do nothing. You have five seconds. I've taken proper shits that bother me more than you. Five... Four... - Three... - Okay, fuck! I'm in the garage. Eddie, I'm sorry for earlier. It's okay. I'm gonna come find you. Okay? I'm gonna come fuckin' find you. I've got ya. - Don't you worry. - No, no, no... Holy fuck. Cindy! Cindy! Cindy! Fuck it! You motherfucking fucking cunt! You're fucking dead when I get my hands on you, you hear me? You're fucking dead! You fucking hear me?! Fucking dead! I'll fuckin' get ya! They killed her! They fucking killed her! Yeah, I know. I know, Eddie. You gotta stay focused, all right? There's some guys come... Oh, shit. All right, all right, change of plans. I need you to hide, All right? Can you do that? I'm gonna gut these fuckers like fish. Hey, the pool house. There's a basement. - Get to the pool house basement. - That's your plan? Hide in a fucking basement, like a rat? For now. Go! Go! Justin, there's been a breach. I gotta get you to a safe location now. Let's go. Yeah, I can't do that, Mike. I saw what you did downstairs. Ah, Justin, goddamn it. See, now that's... that's really unfortunate, because, you know, I wasn't gonna kill you. I really liked you, man. But now? Come on, Justin, put the gun down. I promise to make it quick and painless. Scout's honor. Hey, Boy Scout. Goddamn it, Mike! Why'd you make me do that? You have no idea what's coming. Junior... he ain't gonna stop until you're dead. Burn the whole world down to get what you got in here. Where are the others? You know the answer to that. And that... That ain't gonna hold 'em off. It held you off. You got lucky. But you ain't gonna get lucky four more times. Yeah, maybe not. But help is coming. Sorry I won't be around... to see who gets here first. - Fuck! - Where are you? We got him. Man down. I repeat, man down. - Do not fire. - No! No. Fuck! Okay. What the...? - Hey. - You still there, Fed? Yeah, I'm still here. I thought you were dead. Ah, you care about me, do ya? Let's not get crazy. How are things your end? I'm good... for now. Good. We're making progress. We're a team. Look at that. Hold on. What's the status? Well, his status ain't so good. Ah, Special Agent Rosa. Impressive. Yeah, just a little warm up while I wait for you. I looked you up, Agent. From Secret Service duty to just a lower wire room grunt. Ironic, going from protecting senators to trying to keep that scum Eddie alive. Yeah, well, a job's a job. Well, Agent, looks like you failed at your duties again. You know, it seems to be a pattern for you. Disappointment follows you around. Oh... My apologies. I hate to be the bearer of bad news. Your target's dead. Seems like the coward was hiding in the basement. Why do they always hide in the basement? Seems like your case is closed. Oh, no, our case is just ramping up. We got a new target. You. I'm not too concerned. You should be. Okay. You there? You at the house yet? You're one ballsy son of a bitch, you know that? Yeah, I know, I've been told. He's gonna destroy you. Yeah, he's definitely gonna try. You need to know when to stop, when to give up. Now is that time. Your sacrificing your job and your life. For what? A worthless investigation? You don't know what we have. I know that if you had something, I'd be in cuffs by now. There's more to it. Like you're trying to be a hero, trying to prove something. Was Daddy a cop? Was that it? Are you trying to make him proud? Oh, fuck off. Or maybe you're just trying to right a wrong, seeking a little redemption. We've all been there. You don't know me, asshole. Oh, but I think I do, Special Agent Rosa. How is it a smart guy like you ends up in a shitty wire room? What did you fuck up so badly that you'd need to fix by rescuing me? Hey, you'd be dead if it wasn't for me. Don't try and get in my head. There's no room for you in here. Apologies. But there must be some reason why you risked everything. What is it the Feds want so badly, they're willing to risk an entire investigation to get it, huh? What is it that I have that everyone is... The list! The fucking list. It doesn't exist. Sorry. You risked everything for a rumor. Oh, no, it's much bigger than that now. List or no list... I'm gonna see this thing through to the end. And how does this end, Special Agent Rosa? - I haven't thought it through yet. - But I have. You're gonna help me get out of here alive. And then I'm gonna pull a Keyser Soze, ride into the sunset. Poof! I'm fucking gone. If you do, I'll be coming for you. Yeah? Will ya? You promise? Oh, yeah. I promise. Goddamn it. I'm beginning to love that hoo-rah attitude. Right, let's get our fucking skates on. All right, let's do it. All right. There are three downstairs in the main structure. One heading to the basement now. Get out of sight. Okay, hold right there. Wait. Wait. Okay, now. Fuck you. There's another one coming. Move. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Steady. Don't move. Don't fucking move. Now. Go. All right, Eddie. Nice. Very nice. You got some skills. The rest are all upstairs. At the top of the stairs go left, get the one in the bathroom. Be quiet, right there. All right, all right. All right, there's two more in the front entrance. It's, uh... it's also where they killed Cindy. So prepare yourself. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You fuckin' stay right there. Keep your fuckin' hands down, missy. Did you really think I was gonna let her live? Do you really think I'm gonna let you? Fuck. I'm fuckin' sorry, baby. I'm fuckin' sorry. Feel better? Spiritually fuckin' enlightened, yeah. That's it for downstairs, right? All right, the rest are upstairs. Okay. Why're you stopping? What are you waiting for? How many, and where? Two in the hallway, one in the master bedroom. I truly appreciate your help, Fed. This is where I bid you farewell. No, you mother... fucker... What the fuck? What are you doing? Listen to me. What the hell? It's time for me to saddle up my horse. See you on the other side, Rosa. God... Do not engage. Hold in the stairwell. Reinforcements en route. Hold on. I'm almost there. Hey, hey, you got any guns here? Why the fuck do you need guns? Do you have any guns? Yes or no? There's a safe in the office. Fuck. What the hell have you done? Don't point that at me. Open the safe. Jesus Christ. Come on. I'm not playing games. - Open it. - I'm not playing either. - Come on. - All right. Just calm down, all right? I am calm, open it. Mm-hmm... 72... Jesus Christ. - Mm-hmm. - Are you fuckin' with me, Shane? Open it! Back up. Bingo. You wanna tell me what's going on? Fuck if I know. You called me. - Are you one of them? - Why do you think that? Well, after you ran out of here earlier, then I see you down there having a smoke with Mike, the security guard who tried to fucking kill me. You think I'm corrupt? After the day I had today. The day that you brought on yourself. - I ought a... - I'm not with him. I was meeting my buddy. Yet you decided to go have a smoke. Huh? Waiting for a cab. - You didn't drive your car to work? - I was going drinking. Okay. Okay. You're still dumb as a rock. All right, I'm sorry, all right? I fucked up, all right? It's been a little crazy around here. If you're done, explain this. Why are the guards trying to kill you? - They're with Junior. - Junior? How the fuck do you know that? Yeah, I'll explain it to you. But there's more comin', all right? More? What have you gotten into? - A fuckin' mess. - Yeah, you're a mess. Hey, I called Eddie to save him for you, - for your fucking list. - Mm-hmm. You've been on this case for a year and have done nothing. I've been on it for three hours and I busted it wide open. - You should be thanking me. - "Busted wide open." That's an interesting take. Oh, fuck. Here they come. They're coming, let's go. Come on. Shit. Those our guards? One, two, three, four, five, six... We got eight slugs. - You got your Glock? - Not when I'm drinking. Shit. Here, take this. What about Nour? Does she carry? She'll walk right into this fuckin' mess. Fuck, we gotta call her. My phone is toast, these landlines are shot to shit. What about your phone? Battery died. How many drinks did you have? Just enough. At least we're-we're safe in here. We're not, the security guys have keys. We need to barricade that door. Hey, give me a hand with this shit. Come on, come on, let's go. What's it feel like? What does what feel like? Knowing everyone wants to kill you. Ready? Son of a bitch. Shane! Shane! The glass is bulletproof, asshole. Yeah, no shit. Well... this really isn't the face-to-face you expected, is it? Open the door. I can't do that. Justin! Hey, let her go, asshole. You know what it would cost. Whatever he wants, don't do it. Open the door, drop your gun, or I'll splatter her brains all over this goddamn window. Slowly. Now! All right. Get your ass over here. - Ah, slowly. - Okay. Don't you try nothing, either. Typical hero shit. Always wanna be the savior of others. So predictable. Is that the evidence over there? In one of those? Then take your ass over there, you know what to do. Take her ass with you, too. Slowly. Uh, uh, uh, uh. Let's go, let's go. Let's go. Pull up my files. Now! Hurry up! Even if I delete this, there's still gonna be evidence on you. Look, you two will be dead shortly. You let me worry about that. Motherfucker. You know... If you just would a listened to my instructions, we could a ended this a long time ago. And what, you would a let us live? 'Course not. That's 'cause you're a traitorous piece of shit. Sticks and stones, Special Agent Rosa. Sticks and stones. Who the fuck did I just shoot? And what the fuck happened in here? The kid broke my rule. He destroyed the wire room. From the looks of things, I'd say he broke more than just one. Hey, I'm sorry about your wire room. But it's not just about the room, right? It's about the investigation. I'm not sure the brass are gonna feel the same way. Oh, they will... once they find out we got everything it takes to close this case. And how do you figure we can close the case? He found Junior. Yeah. Also known as Deputy Sheriff Roberts. Uh, that's something I didn't expect to hear. Yeah, there's a lot of explaining to do. Obviously, but we can't close the case because he's dead and he wasn't the target of the investigation. Well, the original target is also dead. Jesus fucking Christ. Uh, wait, I'm sorry, Eddie's dead? Yeah. He blew himself up along with all the others. Jesus... The list. Hey, we'll find it. It'll be in one of his devices, forensics can pull it. Hey, I hate to break it to you guys. There is no list. It doesn't exist. And how do you know that? Eddie. I really wish you would start explaining what the fuck went on tonight. Hey, it's all on tape, assuming we could get any of this shit to work. What the... For your sake, let's hope it does. He saved the case, not the world. Good point. Plus, let's not forget you are directly responsible for the death of the target of the investigation, ss well as a multi-million dollar wire room. Yeah, I guess I'm just not cut out for wire room duty. Too much action for me. What took you so long? Yeah, what did take you so long? I, uh, couldn't find parking. See? I told you, parking around here is a bitch. No, you're right, it's pretty bad. - They probably towed my car. - I mean, yeah, probably. - Yeah, the meter expired hours ago. - Expensive. No, don't tell me that. We don't make a lot. You've reached Homeland Security Investigation Special Agent Justin Rosa. Please leave a message. I'm not sure if you're still listening, or still alive for that matter, but if you are, I'm looking forward to you making good on your promise. Now, I'm texting you something that'll ensure you keep your job after tonight. Because let's face it, every villain needs a hero. It's been fun. See you soon, Special Agent Rosa.
