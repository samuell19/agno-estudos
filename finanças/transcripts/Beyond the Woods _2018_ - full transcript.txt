SHANE: Most definitely, it's just a real long road. It's a really fucking long road. It's really far out, isn't it? Yeah. It's nice though. I couldn't live down here. No way. I want to stay in the city. Yeah. Ger's been sleeping the whole time, has he? Is he still asleep? Yeah. Leave him at it. EMMA: Hopefully the weekend will do him good. EMMA: Is this it? Yeah. EMMA: Oh, my God, is that a... SHANE: It is. [CAR HONKS] EMMA: It's gorgeous. Oh, look. SHANE: This is nice! Will you promise to behave yourself? Yeah, I'll do my best. The country is the place for mischief. I'm a mischievous guy! [BOTH LAUGHING] I don't want to go against my nature. There they are. Looking well. Jesus Christ, lads! What the hell is that smell, huh? It's getting worse. Hi! Hi. How are you? Lovely to see you. JASON: You missed the news so. Oh, come here, guys, the place looks amazing! It's in the middle of nowhere, it's so isolated. You could get up to anything. As usual the two of you look impeccable. MARISSA: Thank you. But the stink is really bad. Seriously, what is that stench? Is there a pig farm near by? It's a sinkhole. It was all over the news. EMMA: What, you're not serious? JASON: Yeah. MARISSA: Hi, how are you? So this is the famous holiday home. Yeah. It's nice. Listen, I'm sorry to hear about Barbara. How are you holding up? Yeah, well... Fine I suppose. It ran it's course. Or so she said. Well, I'm glad you could make it. Me too. Even if it does stink down here. Oh, God. The one weekend I manage to get everybody here. You're not serious, though. It's beyond the woods. It's over by the old mines on the mountain. We should go take a look. How far away? and people aren't allowed near it. It's burning hot, and that smell that you're getting They say coal spontaneously combusted or something. We'll make the most of it. SHANE: We'll stay indoors. GER: Have you been up there? If it stinks that bad two miles away, it must be pungent near it. Peter the sergeant told us his crowd have the whole place sealed off. For safety. Apparently it's actually over 800 degrees there. Jesus. Yeah, I know. They're calling it the gates of hell! SHANE: Now I really have to go take a look now. We should head inside. That stink is nauseating. EMMA: Yeah, yeah. SHANE: I'll just grab some bags. I'll give you a hand. Okay you guys are in here. Oh, wow, it's gorgeous, thank you so much. Oh, well, then I'll follow you down. Ger, you're in the box room. I know it's small. I hope you don't mind. No. I can sleep anywhere. Come down when you're ready, okay? Thanks. Hey man, want one? Sure, beer me. I tell you, with that stink and the road closures we could be in the house a lot As long as there's plenty of this, I don't really give a shit. Finally. Friday night, eh? Friday night. Friday night. Mm. It's nice. Yeah, it's good. Strong. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] It's nice though. It's nice. I suppose it's better than being outside anyway. I know. I was just thinking when was the last time we were properly proper drinking together? [SIGHS] At Barry's... Barry had a party about a year ago, was it? It's not that long, it can't be that long ago. It was a year and a half ago or something. Down on that island? Yeah, down the island. It was his fucking stag it was! We were on those banana boats and it was during the day... It was crazy. ...and we were drinking because we hired a boat. All those little inflatable things were cool as well. and the fact it was daytime and there were kids there as well and we were running knocking kids left, right and center! Ah, he's terrible. He's so innocent though. That was a good boat trip. [WIND BLOWING] Is someone living up there? Not anymore! [ALL LAUGHING] There are a couple of houses around, aren't there? Yeah, but, well, I think, we are kinda, the closest really. Because it's up near the old mines. Yeah, it's fairly, that, like... The only people that go up there are kids messing about. So does it open at night or in the morning? What do you mean? It's not an amusement park! It doesn't have opening hours! Can we go overnight? Can we go in the morning? Did you see the peak times? [DOOR BELL RINGS] That'll be the lads. Hi! Welcome! Good to see you. You look great! So do you. Hi, Marissa, nice to see you. Hi, how are you? I'm so sorry we're late. No, not at all, you're grand. SHANE: Will you come in and shut the door! That stink is getting everywhere! Hey. Hey. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] So what's with the smell? The devil farted and blew open the gates of hell. No, it's a sinkhole up in the mountain. It's all sulfur. A sinkhole? Those things really freak me out. That's one thing I hate about the countryside. All this talk about remote working, it's bullshit. Reception here is brutal. Stop being so rude, we're only just in the door. I just need to check my voicemail, I missed a call. The reception here is really bad. It's part of the charm of the place. It's one of the reasons we come up here. But if you really want it, if go down to the end of the garden, you'll get some there. Jeez, can't you not stay off the thing for five minutes? We're only in the door. I'll be quick honey. I promise, okay? Just this last thing and then we can start drinking. He's actually never off that thing. He's like a teenager. Do you want coffee? Wine? Beer? Coffee. Thanks. Sorry we're late. I'm lucky I got Ray out the door at all. [BIRDS FLUTTERING] [SIGHS] I could stay here all day. [DOOR BELL RINGS] It's a lovely getaway. And it smells nice in here. Yeah. That's all. I'm a trip adviser. [ALL LAUGHING] That smell is rank. That's better. The church missed a trick focusing on fire and brimstone. Use the toilet after a man loaded up on Guinness and gherkins that'll be sure to make you change your ways. There's no need to bring that up again. There's never a bad time to bring that up. RAY: So I guess there's no outdoor activities this weekend. Is your modem on by the way? I couldn't get a connection. There's no modem. There's no internet. That's the whole point of this place. Oh fuck, you're not serious? You said they have internet! I asked you to check! You know I have to be connected! Can you not just stay off that thing for one weekend? I'm sure they can get by in work without you for a couple of days! Some of us have important work to do, you know? We don't just sit around all day writing articles. Stop being such a cock. You are such a cock! [ALL LAUGHING] [GROWL] He's looking for matches! [LAUGHING] How far away is that thing? What thing? The... Oh, the hole! Um, it's about two miles, I think. It's on the side of the mountain. Is it dangerous? No, I don't think so. Otherwise, Pete would have told us to get out. The chief superintendent is down with him for the next few days helping him deal with the press and the road blocks. Don't look so worried. It's okay. It's not that big at all. They're just looking for something to fill up the news. Yeah, but what about the fumes... The fumes... No worse than the fumes in the city. I suppose. Anyone fancy a smoke? Nice one. But we'll have to smoke it outside. For fuck's sake! House rules. It's your fucking house! It's Marissa's father's place, and come on, he doesn't want smoking in here. Let's go. I might make a quick call. For fuck's sake. They're splashing him with water constantly, and then he goes, "Mr Fungi?" And he's there dead on the ground. Did they not have the animal rights people coming down about that? About fungi? Yeah. He was like, "Can I get a smoke there please?" I mean, those guys, they watch him like a hawk. This is a cartoon fungi, it's not real fungi! Yeah, it's not, like, real. Oh. What? Real fungi was gonna... Yeah, yeah. Sorry, yeah. I knew that. I knew that. I didn't know you smoked. I don't. Oh. No, I don't. You don't. [ALL CHUCKLING] Are you okay? Yeah, fine. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm fine. Did you have enough to eat? I did, yeah. It was lovely, thank you. You're very welcome. Did you like my lasagna? I loved it. [CHUCKLING] Working hard in the kitchen. Go all day flat. It was lovely. I haven't ever had one before. You're really quiet today. I'm fine. I'm just tired. Over the last few weeks, you know? I haven't been getting great sleep and stuff. Are you sure that's all? Yeah. That's it. What else would it be? Well, come on, I mean, you've been through a lot. Yeah. You know? It's just a bit, you know, first time being around you all again without her. Yeah. Yeah. Right, that's it. I can't handle that smell anymore. It's giving me a headache. I'm going in. Where are you going? I'm just checking if Ray is still out here. Do you want a knife? I have one. Ray? Ray? [CREAKING] [GASPS] You're so jumpy! Ray's in the house. Okay. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] If you're really good and you go to heaven, does that mean the gambling... Where's the gambling and booze? Is it in heaven for being good? Or is it in hell for just kind of... Well, that's where we all are. Maybe hell is everyone's worst nightmare. Individually. Whatever your worst nightmare is. If your worst, worst nightmare was spiders then your hell would be in a room full of spiders forever. I'm so scared of strippers and booze. [ALL LAUGHING] SHANE: Your last dying thought is like, "My worst fear is I just absolutely hate sun holidays!" That is in some short story, that that is what hell is your worst nightmare. That it is a personal thing. If we led a really bad life but at the very last moment... SHANE: You become an organ donor or something. Yeah, can you redeem yourself that way? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] SHANE: That's Pascal's wager. You can just be crap for your whole life which I plan on kinda doing. Would it work the other way then? If you were really good, like, were really, um, didn't do anything bad and then at the last moment you did something awful... Shot a baby! Yeah. Oh. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Would all your good stuff then be, like, forgotten? MARISSA: No, I don't think so. They'd weigh it up! What's the symbol for the judicial system? You know, the scales. Yeah, it's that with, uh, St. Peter with... [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I don't know if it's the food or the smoke or what but I am really tired. I'm going to have to go to bed. You shouldn't be smoking. You know how you get. Why, how do I get? Like that. [GROWLING] [PLEASANT MUSIC PLAYING] Do you know what would really liven this place up? Strip poker. No way I'm getting my kit off in front of you. It's not you I want to see with your kit off. Oh, yeah? In your dreams. RAY: Eye's off my wife, you pervert. Don't worry. I only have eyes for this beauty here. RAY: Oh. Get a room. Jesus. [MUMBLES] I'm going to hit the hay. EMMA: But, Ger, it's only one! I'm wrecked. I'm not used to social drinking. SHANE: You mean, you normally drink on your own? I'm only messing! Well, I'm going to go as well. I'm wrecked. Night. Night. Ooh! Leaving together! Lucy and Gerny! We're going to get all hot and steamy together, aren't we, Ger? [ALL LAUGHING] Goodnight. RAY: And enjoy. See you later. [LAUGHTER] Oh, hey. Marissa told me about Barbara. I'm really sorry, I thought you guys were great together. I don't know. It just wasn't meant to be. Do you think we end up with the person we're meant to end up with? I like to think so. Yeah. Me too. Goodnight. Goodnight. For fuck's sake. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS] [WATER RUNNING] [SIREN WAILING] [GASPS] And here I thought you guys came out here to get away from it all. Should we give Pete a shout? What good would that do? They're not local squad cars. I hate that sound. Me too. Well, it wouldn't be much use if you liked it. In all the years we've been coming here, I don't think I've ever heard sirens. But in all those years there's never been a sinkhole. SHANE: What is a sinkhole anyway? It just opens up... Yeah, I think. I don't know. The landfill or something? Does it... There's nothing under it and no one noticed until someone stepped on it? EMMA: How deep is it? That's what I was wondering, because if it is some sort of chemical reaction... Seeing as I'm not gonna be able to get any work done, I might as well do some damage. Who's joining me? That's my cue. Mine too. Jesus. Your wife goes so you have to go as well? Don't forget, we've to do this again tomorrow. I thought this was a party! Marissa, will you please, please just... give your husband permission to stay up for a few more? He can do what he likes. He speaks for himself. I'm wrecked, man. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You haven't been drinking as long as I have. You got to live for today. Tomorrow might never come. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good night, Mr. Brooks. At least you two are still up for it. Thank you very much, Mr. Brooks. Cheers! That's much better. Ooh. Our little friend here. Nice. [FOOTSTEPS] [DOOR SHUTS] I think you're in the doghouse. Nah. She's always like that. Yeah, blame her. Mmm-mmm. She likes to sit around doing nothing. I can't do that. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [SCREECHING, GROWLING] [GASPING] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] I think we should go up to the stinkhole tomorrow, eh? I'm not going up there. Why not? I mean, when's the next time you're gonna see something like this? I don't I ever need to see something like that. Hurry up with that joint, will you? The stink is starting to get to me. I'm kinda getting used to it. [ALL LAUGHING] Fuck off. No, he's right. Kill that thing. Anyway, I want to go to bed. All right, lads. This is getting awkward. It doesn't have to be. [DOOR CREAKING] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] Baby? Baby, wake up! [GROANS] Yeah. Listen, I think Ray is sleeping with Emma and Shane. [LAUGHS SOFTLY] Good one. No, no, no. I'm not joking. I saw him going into their room. Yeah. I'm tired. Listen, I listened at the door. They were having sex. They probably... They probably saw you and wanted to wind you up. No, they didn't see me. [SIGHS] Of course, they saw you. It's just like something Shane and Emma would do. No, I'm sure they didn't see me. They saw you. They saw you. I'm going down again. Oh... Don't be crazy. Come on. No, no, no. It's not crazy. Okay? Emma... She's always been wild. In college, she was always getting up to things. [SIGHS] We all did crazy things in college. Yeah, but that's normal crazy. I'm talking about, like, getting drunk crazy, jumping into a fountain crazy. Emma pushes things. I know her. I know her. Whoa! Come back to bed. Come on. No. No. I'm going to make sure, okay? Look, this is ridiculous. They're just messing with you. But then I'll ask her. Now? No! Not now! In the morning. I can see tomorrow's going to be fun. Do you think she'll tell you? No. But I'll know. [ALL MOANING] [MOANING CONTINUES] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] [DOOR CREAKS] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] Is anyone out there? Jason! Are you all right? Jason, are you okay, man? Jason, you need to come inside. It's freezing out here. And it stinks. You must be pretty fucking drunk, man... What did we do? You don't remember? I remember we said never with friends. I need a coffee. Do you want one? No, I don't want a coffee. Shit! How are we going to face them now? The same way we always face them. They don't know anything. What about Ray? He's not going to say anything. Oh, fuck! Don't worry. Okay? Just forget about it. We'll pretend it didn't happen. Oh. I'm so sorry. Did I wake you? No. I'm... Did you see Ray? Um... No. Is he not with you? No. I don't think he came to bed last night. Really? Hmm. Well, actually I can't be too sure. That bed is so comfy, I slept like a corpse. I thought he might have fallen asleep out there. Wouldn't be the first time. I mean, once he gets drunk. Jesus! That stink's gotten way worse today. Yeah, I know. Just shut the door. Oh! Morning. Where's Ray? How would I know? No. Was he still up when you went to bed last night? Yeah, he was. And you were the last to go to bed? Uh, yep. Where the fuck is he then? I don't know. Maybe he's outside on his phone? [SCOFFS] Believe me that's the first place that I looked. Was he still drinking when you went to bed? Yeah, I suppose. I mean, he wanted to stay up, you know? You know how he is. Is your car outside? You fucking prick. What is it? Work. He can't leave it alone just for a couple of days. Oh, I'm so sorry, hon. Come here. He's just a fucking prick! Well, I knew what he was like when I married him. I hope that's full of tea. Excellent. Are you okay? Ray left. For work. Sorry. He left for work I'm really glad that I'm here with all of you. Ray can go do what he likes. I'm going to enjoy myself. Breakfast is here. All right! Perfect timing. I'm fucking starving. What did you get, man? Which is the one where Roger Moore is skiing and then he jumps off with the Union Jack parachute? Will I give you a hand? No, I'm fine. GER: Anyone up for a walk? I don't want to ruin breakfast with lungs full of stinky air. Come on. It's not that bad. You'll get used to it. It's lovely outside. LUCY: Maybe if you're wearing a gas mask. I think the smell has gotten much worse today. Anyone? No way. Not me. I've too much to do. Well, I don't know how you can stay inside all day, even with the smell. We should go for a drive! We could go down to the sea or something! Sorry to report that the stink is everywhere. It's even worse down in the village. And we can't go to the sea. The roads are closed. Well, we'll just have to make the most of being here. Won't we? Well, I'm going to walk off that breakfast. I'll see you lot later. Bye. Enjoy. SHANE: Good luck. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] EMMA: It's so toasty here. It is. Look at me, I'm all sleepy even though I slept so well last night. Did you see him when you got up this morning? Who? Ray? Mm. No. Was his car there? [WHISPERING] Um, I think so, yeah, but I was tired, so I'm not sure. Do you think he spent the whole night with them? Oh, come on. I don't want to think about that. When are you going to ask Shane? What? I'm not asking Shane anything. You said you'd ask Emma! And anyway, I still think they were messing with you. No, I know what they did. Well, you spent long enough out there listening to them. And how did listening at their door for an hour help? It wasn't an hour. It was only a few minutes. Anyway, I think Ray is feeling guilty because he can't even face us this morning. You saw the note. He had work. Anyway, look, it's none of our business. [LOUDLY] None of our business! Carry on. Nothing to see here. Look, you finish up there. I'm tired. I'm going to lie down. All right. [RUSTLING] [FAINT GROWL] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] Isn't it a bit early for that? It's never too early for wine and cheese. There you go. Thanks. Do I cut? This weekend was a big mistake. No, it wasn't. We've been planning this for ages. Yeah. I didn't expect it to turn out like this. Look, we're all here now so let's just make the most of it. Yeah. Take your clothes off. [FAINT GROWLING] [FAINT GROWLING] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [FAINT GROWLING] You're starting early. There's not much else to do in here. I'm sure you could think of something. What's that supposed to mean? Um... You don't even have a fucking TV. I know, I know. Relaxing getaway and all that. Are you going to join me? Yeah. He does work really hard. EMMA: Mm-hmm. Like, he's got... He just really has a work ethic. I just wish that he could switch it off from time to time. Yeah, but if he's ambitious, you know... Yeah. And it is one of the things that I love about him. It's one of the things I hate about him, too. [BOTH CHUCKLE] He's just always focused on work, even if, you know, we have things planned for the evening, or just a night in front of the telly, he'll always take the laptop out and just finds it hard to switch off. Have you said it to him? I think he knows. Oh. Thank you. Thank you. But, um, I don't want to seem... I know work is really important to him... Thanks. You don't want to seem like you're nagging. Yeah, exactly. I think you should just say it to him. You should say it to him because... That's... Thanks. Jesus. That's grand, thanks. Come on, Emma. You can handle it. Maybe organize a holiday or something. It's really hard for him to get time off work. It always used to bother me more than him that he's working. Mmm-hmm. Who, Ray? Yeah. Just constantly... [CHUCKLES] I mean, he really does work hard. He takes it very seriously. But he's just... Be back in two seconds. Sorry. [GASPS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GROWLING] I'd love to just ask him just to get away for a proper holiday. Ladies. Shh, we can't talk about them anymore! Yeah, yeah. Say no more now. Don't worry, I'm used to that. Really? Yeah, he's used to everyone talking about him. I'm just gonna go out and make a quick call. I'll just try Ray again. You okay? Yeah, yeah. I'll just give him another try. [FAINT GROWL] [FAINT GROWL] There'd be no silence if there was a TV. There'd be no talking either. So much different to now, so. Look, I'll let you in on a little secret. [SOFTLY] There is a TV. What? The reception is bad, and it only has the Irish channels. We could watch a movie! I have to just plug my usb key in. I'll say it to Marissa later. Yeah. What's up with Marissa anyway? She's been acting weird all morning. Well... Babes, I need you in the bedroom, yeah? Right. Always in demand. Hey! You've reached Ray. and I'll call you back as soon as possible. Thank you. [BEEP] Will you answer your phone? You'd answer the fucking thing if it was work! SHANE: You're serious? Yes. Fuck sake. We fucked up. Who fucking leaves messages on mirrors? We really fucked up. What were we thinking? No, no, no, you can't, because you don't know for sure who wrote it. Yes, I do. Yes, she's been acting weird all morning. It could have been Jason. Well, yeah, because if she knows he knows. Fuck! What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? We can't leave, all right? They're our friends. We can't just run away. Come on, just get your stuff together. I'm going out for a think, all right? [FAINT GROWL] Jesus Christ! Dude, relax, will you? [SIGHS] Was that you? The growling? Have you been following me all along? I've better things to do with my time than follow you around. What are you doing all the way out here, then? All the way out here? Are you all right? Just show me the way back to the house, will you? I can't find it. Have you been smoking grass? The house is right over there. Is this where you've been for the last few hours? Hours? Have you been eating mushrooms or something? I mean, you know, because if you have... Have you been feeling weird at all since you got here? Look, nothing's been normal since we got here. I mean like, your head? Headaches? No. What are you talking about? I think there's something in the air. You got that right. We should go back inside. Yeah, go ahead. I'll follow you back. You should come with me. There's something wrong out here. It's not just the smell. There's something in the air. That's bullshit, all right? I got lost and I'm right beside the house. If you stay out here on your own, something's gonna happen to you. Fuck off. Look, the house is right fucking there! Not always. [FAINT GROWL] Do you hear that? [WHISPERS] What? Listen. Oh, come on... [SHUSHING] [LOUD RUMBLING] Shit. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] Lads, what was that? Did you see anything out there? They said the sinkhole would likely get bigger. You need to ring Pete. Sounds like the gates of hell just got blown wide open. Don't say that. I think we should leave. We should definitely stay inside. There's no need to panic. I'll ring Pete and see what the story is, okay? MARISSA: Yeah. So much for rest and the joys of nature. I've always said it. Nature is a beast that can't be tamed. EMMA: You have never said that. I often say that. How was your walk? I got lost. He was outside the back door. I think there's something in the air, not just the smell. Chemicals or something. Chemicals? [SOFTLY] It's all the tea. That might explain it. Explain what? I have a headache. You're hung over. JASON: Okay. Pete said to stay put. There was a gas explosion up by the old mine. No one hurt, no damage done. That didn't sound like no damage. Well, the reception was bad but he did say everything is fine. and he said the environment people have already been up there and gave it the all-clear. Look, maybe we've just been drinking and smoking too much, huh? Let's just pull out the TV and watch a movie for a while, yeah? Hang on. You have a TV? Yeah. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING ON TV] [WHISPERS] Stop. [ALL SCREAM] [ALL LAUGHING] LUCY: Oh, shit! SHANE: Just when it was getting good! JASON: I think, I think... It's just the trip-switch. It goes from time to time. But God what a time to go! [ALL LAUGHING] You want a hand? I'd love it! Nah, I'm only messing. I've got it. I've got it. Okay. [WOMEN CONTINUE LAUGHING] LUCY: That was the scariest part. SHANE: They taking proper jumpers. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] Jesus Christ! You scared the shit out of me! Are you all right? [LOUD GROWL] [THUD] Do we need more beers? Should we get more beers before it's too late? No, we should have plenty. We can't do anything about it now anyway, all the drivers have been drinking. I could call Ray. Good luck with that. I'm sure the cops around here won't mind a little drunk driving. Don't even say that. What are we gonna do? We don't have any beer. [SCOFFS] I'm sure you'll think of something. Oh, I see. But really you didn't have to go all crazy lady shit with the fucking lipstick. I'm talking about the message you decided to leave on the mirror. Very mature. Huh. Look who's talking. Maybe it was the smokes, or whatever is coming out of that sinkhole. I mean, even Ger is saying that things are going... Jesus, will you take some responsibility for yourself for once? For once? I always take responsibility for myself! You're always out partying, or drinking, with men. What? Oh, my God! It's not like you never partied. What's that supposed to mean? You know exactly what that means. You're gonna have to tell Lucy. And what good could that possibly do? It's the right thing to do. Really? Because I don't remember you saying that the last time you saw him with another woman. I didn't know her. And what difference does that make? She's your friend really! I mean, I barely know her. but when was the last time we ever met up for a cup of coffee? Look, this happened in my house, okay? You're going to have to tell her, or I will. [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] That's weird. I didn't think there was any reception in here. Anyway, it's Jason. He says he's outside with a smoke. Anyone want to... I'll pass. I'm out. Well, suit yourselves. Is it just me or are things getting a bit weird around here? Mmm-hmm. God, you don't do things by halves, anyway. Well, everyone keeps telling me that. Sometimes I wish I was a bit more like you. You know, more spontaneous. Well, it's easy. Just do something spontaneous. [BOTH LAUGHING] Jason. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] What the fuck are they doing out there? Building a fort? I'll go out, take a look. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Shane. Shane! Well, I don't know where they are. I don't know what they're doing. I thought I heard them outside earlier. Okay. [SCREAMS] Oh, my God! Oh, my God. [LAUGHS] Go away! Go away. Oh, my God, he gave me a heart attack! I'm gonna kill him. Oh, my God. Jesus. Will you join me now? Jesus! What was the screaming about? Just Shane acting the maggot again. Fuck sake. Are those two still outside? Mmm-hmm. They must have a lot to talk about. [LAUGHING] Need a beer. Lucy, I need to tell you something. No. I'll tell her. We're planning a big night out for your birthday next month. Really? Are you serious? Yeah. Well, look I wasn't going to tell you, but Emma said that we should just in case you had plans. [EXCLAIMS] That's so nice! I thought you were going to tell me something serious. This isn't a weekend for serious things. Excuse me a second. Oh, listen, will you call the lads back in on your way? EMMA: Yeah. Yeah, I really do hope it will be. [LAUGHING] [SNIFFS] [GASPS] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] You are snappy. [EMMA SCREAMING] [SCOFFS] Emma's such a drama queen. She is on her own in the dark. That sound freaked me out, and I was here with you guys. We should go and get her. [SIGHS] Come on. Jesus! We have to get out of here! Everything's wrong! I can't stay... I'm not staying here. What? Fuck. It has to be the sinkhole. The fumes. But Pete said... I lost it out in the woods. Now Emma... You think there's something in the air? I know there is. This whole weekend hasn't been right. MARISSA: Don't be stupid! We've all been drinking. [ENGINE STARTS] Fuck! Emma! Wait! This is fucked up. Was there anyone in the car with her? No, I didn't see anyone. So where the hell are the other two? The fuse box. We should call the police. Emma was drinking vodka straight... No, no, no, no, no, no. We're not calling the police. She could lose her license! She could go to prison... No. We're not calling the police. I'm calling the police. Jason! Jason! They must be down by the well. I'm gonna get Jason then we'll go after her. But we've been drinking. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] Jason! [BIRDS FLUTTERING] [CELL PHONE RINGING] [DISTORTED VOICE] ...coming to the house... Ray... Shane and Jason are with me... Wait. I can't hear you. Be long... What? [STUTTERING] Wait. What? [DISTORTED VOICE] Coming to get you... What? Are Shane and Jason with you? Ray? Ray, can you hear me? Ray! Shit. What was that about? I don't know. Reception was awful. I think Ray's on his way and that Shane and Jason are with him. How could Shane and Jason be with him? I don't know. We need to find Marissa. But she's down by the well. Do you know where it is? She'll be back in a minute. We should just wait here. Just show me where it is. [SIGHS] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] MARISSA: Jason. Jason! Jason! LUCY: Marissa! Marissa! There are signs everywhere, pointing all over the place. None of them lead anywhere but round and round in circles. We shouldn't go there. [SHUSHES] What's that? GER: That's Jason's ringtone. LUCY: Come on! [BREATHING HEAVILY] Jason! Jason! Jason! Jason! [GROWLING] [SCREAMING] [WHIMPERING] [GROWLING] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] [SCREAMS] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] [SCREAMS] [KNOCKING CONTINUES] [SCREAMS] Oh, fuck. You fucking stabbed me. Oh, fuck! I'm so sorry! It hurts. I'll get help! Where the fuck are you going to get help? Oh, God. SHANE: Help me. MARISSA: I'm so sorry. I can't. [LOUD GROWLING] LUCY: Jason! Shane! GER: Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean, these woods... LUCY: Something might have happened to them. GER: But didn't you say they were with Ray? LUCY: I don't know. I couldn't hear him properly. LUCY: I think it's coming from over there. [CELL PHONE RINGING] Jason. Pete? No, this is Lucy. I'm a friend of Jason's. What? Why? He said we've gotta get out of here right now. Why? I don't know. He sounded scared. Let's go. We can't! What about Jason? I'm not getting lost out in the woods again. Come on, Lucy! No no no... No. Please, no. MARISSA: Emma! Emma! Wait! Emma! Emma! [BIRD FLUTTERING] [GROWLING] [GROWLING] [GASPS] LUCY: We were never this far from the house. I told you. There's something in the air. LUCY: Do you drive? GER: No. You? No. But Marissa does. [SOBBING] [LOUD THUD] [SCREAMS] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [GASPS] [CROW CAWING] Ray! He's back! [OWL HOOTING] [GROWLING] [FOOTSTEPS] [GROWLING] LUCY: Ray! Ray! [SOFTLY] Ray? Ray? [GROWLING] Ray? Are you okay? [WOMAN IN DISTORTED VOICE] Ray? Ray's more than okay. He's fucking great! [SCREAMING] [MUFFLED SCREAM] [SHUSHES] GER: It's me! It's me! It's me. It's me. Be cool. I saw something. I did too. We have to get out of here. That's what I've been saying all along. It's Ray. It's Ray. Ray! Ray! Ray! Ray! GER: That's not Ray! Ray! Ray! I saw him! It's a fucking creature! Ray! Ray! Ray! Wait for me! We have to get out of here! RAY: No one is getting out of here. [OWL HOOTING] Ray! Where are you? RAY: I'm not here. You're scaring me! RAY: It's not a sinkhole. It's just fun for them. Ray! RAY: Stay where you are! [DISTORTED VOICE] We're all gone. All except you and Ger. If you want to live tonight, you'll have to sacrifice your soul. It needs seven souls, it can't go back with less. I can't save anyone else. Neither can you. This is the only way. Sacrifice your soul tonight, and you'll have the rest of your life to earn it back. LUCY: But we can leave now. It's too late for me. Let me save you. [LUCY SCREAMING] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] GER: Lucy. Thank God. I thought you were gone. We have to get out of here. Come on. We have to get out of here. We have to go back to the house. We can't go back there. Why? Because Ray is there. Even though he's not Ray anymore. What do you mean? He's dead. Everyone is dead. Oh. Jesus Christ. Ray said that he's going to help us. But I thought you just said that he was dead? No, I spoke to him. He said he's going to buy us time. But we have to leave now, okay? [GROWLING] [SCREECHING] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] Wait a minute! Aren't we running towards the sinkhole? The sinkhole is where all these fucking things are coming from! We can't turn back. You have to trust me. I want to go back. [GROWLING] [GROANS] I'm sorry! What have you done? What have you done! Help! Help me! [LOUD GROWL] [LOUD CRASH] [LUCY SCREAMS] [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING]
