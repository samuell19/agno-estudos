Carlyle, who's this guy you've been seeing? God, what will your father say? - Carlyle. - Shh. Here he comes. Carlyle. The philosophy professors are coming over for drinks. Don't be late. Sorry, sister. What a drag to live at home. Move into the dorms with us. I wish I could. -I got you. -No! No, not the sleeper, not the sleeper. Not the sleeper. You through? I won! I'm the winner.

Oh, geez, excuse me. Um, I wouldn't ask if it wasn't an emergency, could I use your bathroom? Well, it ain't my house, but, ah, it's upstairs. -Mmm-hmm. -Need a hand? No, it's okay. - You sure? - Yeah, sure. Watch out for Otis' old lady. So how're you doin'? Huh? What can I do for you? Huh, what's that? Where you goin'? Oh. A little pink in here. Yeah. Can't you wait? No, look at this. You think his mom made this? That's right. She did. How about some ice cream? No. No, thank you. You sure? Yeah. What's the matter, you afraid you might catch something? No. Let me show you two girls the rest of the house. Get a towel. Here you go. Come on, boner! Carlyle! Damn, girl. You crazy. Hell, I thought she was goin' to move. Some kind of badass? Give me the keys. -Give me the keys. -Oh, you forgot to say please. -Give me the keys and we'll go. -You'll go when I say. You know, you'd better let us go now or-- Or what, what? What? You know who her father is? Hey, boys, we got us some high society of pussy here. Oh, yeah. Well, it must be nice to get whatever you want. I think I'm a little lunch hungry. Oh, yeah. T-Bone, you hungry? I think I can use a little food. -What is this? -Have a slab. Hell, I ain't waxed a car in a long time. Guys, come on! You'll wreck the car. Her dad's gonna kill her. Yo, Otis. It's Fritz. We're the motherfuckers... Oh... You can go. But first... you gotta kiss ass. Theirs... then mine. Hey, Otis. Let the girls go. And, I bet you wouldn't kiss that ass. Well! How about you, Mrs. Fucking Queen? No problem. You first. He's gonna do it. Shit, I ain't kissing that. Ass kisser, you look like your mother. Hey, up yours! You shouldn't have done it, man. -Otis-- -You side with those rich bitches over me. But, you working at that fucking college don't make you any better than us. White's not my color. I'm not like you, man. Not anymore. He'll be back. I don't know. He'll be back. Oh, man. My dad's going to kill me. No sweat, your dad'll never know. My heart's racing now, I... Don't you know when to quit? Dawg! Dawg. Dawg! Yeah! Well... Dumb dog. Stupid dog. Dog... Dog. Dumb dog! ...sky is so damn bright. - Stop! - Stop! Shit! No! Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus. I didn't even see him, there he was all of a sudden. Dawg! Dawg, are you okay? -Dawg. -I think he'll be okay. What's his name? Dawg. He's Dawg. Dawg. He's going to be okay? He'll be fine. He'll be just fine. You know him? Look, it'll be alright. We'll take Dawg to the vet. Yeah, kid, don't worry about it. It'll be okay. Hey, do you like ice cream? -Hmm? -Yeah. Okay. We'll go get some. I got it! I got the ball! I got it! I got it! I got it! Look, I got the ball! Don't look at me that way. -Bio Lab. -Fritz. This is the sheriff. There's something I need to talk to you about. Please, come down to the station right away. Alright. I've been reading the coroner's report, it says here Ebin was covered with ice cream and had a near lethal dose of alcohol in his bloodstream. Retards shouldn't play with trains. Hey! Cut it out! This isn't gonna help you, kid. Hey. My brother never drank. Somebody had to give it to him. Hey, hey. Calm down, huh? I wish there was some way around this, but you got to identify the body. You wait out here. "You wait out here". That poor boy. Yes, sir. Okay, boy, get out, go on. Bob! I know you're upset, but you can't be driving around all crazy now. Go on home. She had my brother's dog. It wouldn't surprise me, but you know her father. Let it go. Fuck! Yeah, Otis said you'd be back. Says you are your past. Ebin's dead. Got hit by a train. Somebody got him drunk. Somebody killed him. Shit. Fuck off! Wake up, man. What the fuck you want? Fritz is here. Yeah? Says somebody killed Ebin. Life is fucked. Who do you think did it? The girls in the Mercedes. Come on, man. Why would they want to kill Ebin? Why would anybody want to kill Ebin? Because he was perfect. Hell, we'll do whatever the hell you want to do. Someone's going to pay. Fucker! Let's get it on. Man, this plan is fucking genius. I'm telling you, they ain't never going to recognize us. You're killing me, man. What if they recognize my mother's car? Not with the top down. There they are. Where's Bone? Which bone? Hey, man, what're you doing in there? T, come on, man, get out here, we're going to lose 'em. You know, I was thinking, man, what if these chicks don't want to go with us? Ignore 'em. It works every time. Richer, deeper, thicker than any other animal tone heard in the air before or since is the mating call of the great dinosaur. Might take a little persuasion. Not yet. The call is close to the harmonic sounds of volcano, tornado, earthquake. A young female walking in grazing moves into the range of the young male. She is a speck in the distance to his eye, to his exquisitely sensitive nose. She moves, she is provocative, an intoxicating presence to him. They move together. The young male calls to her. His thorax swells. There is a pause. He crushes the air out in one great deep tone. It ends. When his chest... I remember. ...swells, hers does also. The pulse of their dark dissonance throbs in the air like a heartbeat. The bond is formed. Moving off together they rub the length of their necks together. She licks algae from the inside of the young male's mouth. They are one in dinosaur. She honks... ...to signal her readiness. Of all the planets of the universe, planet Earth is most likely to self-destruct. Without society's... Why are you chasing me? ...firm grasp... Why were you running? To see if you'd catch me. ...original and primeval... I have. ...that of the beast. Carlyle, isn't your dad -expecting us for dinner? -Mmm-mmm. Wouldn't want to disappoint the dean. How do you know he's my father? I know everything about you. What do you say we go for ice cream? You girls like ice cream? I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream. Aren't we going to stop? Where are we going? This gives me the creeps. What, you never saw a factory before? What a weird place. Yeah, tell me about it. I work here. - Yeah, right. - Got a problem with that? Why do you know me so well? I don't know you. Well, there's no reason for you to know who I am. But everybody knows who you are. It's a small town. What does everyone know? Well, they know who you are, who your dad is and that you get whatever you want. You've got no idea what I want. Oh, I've got a couple of ideas. Let's go. We got 'em, now what? I don't know. I only know I'm going to make them tell the truth if I have to. You have to what? What did I tell you? I told you not to leave them alone, right? You girls wondering why I brought you here? Well, I got a surprise. Come on inside. Oh, I know. - What's he gonna do to 'em? - Trust me. What the fuck do I look like, a mind reader? Pretty quiet in here. Does anyone live near here? Yeah, stiffs. There's a cemetery out back. Graveyards do something to me. Ow! Ow. So, is this where you guys usually go for ice cream? Yeah. -C'mon, why are we here? -Why are we here? What? Well, excuse me. It's a little fucking hot in here if you know what I mean. Shit. Hey. You're that biker. Fucking A student. You know, you better leave us alone. We don't take orders from you. I want you to order me around the graveyard. Why'd you bring us here? Does the name Ebin Collins ring a bell? No. What's the matter, don't you read the paper? It made the headlines, "kid killed by train." You think we had anything to do with that? Answer the question. It said in the paper it was an accident. Yeah, the kid was slow. As in can't outrun a train? Talk to me, Fritz. Give me the bottle. Why are you so concerned? It was his brother. I don't believe it. Believe it. Now, you did something to my brother and you're gonna tell me what. No, we didn't. Don't you fucking lie to me! Shit, we're happening now. Now, my little brother never had a drink in his life. Never. And we know you girls like to drink. Thirsty girls. Thirsty girls. Now, hold on. It's a simple story. We accidentally hit his dog. You guys know what you've done? You've kidnapped us. You're going to jail. All of you. I don't give a fuck! Fritz, isn't this getting a little heavy? Thanks for coming, girls. Well, the party's over. Get them! Why'd you give him the booze? I don't know anything, I swear. You decided to have a party with him, didn't you? No, I wasn't there. I swear. I took the dog to the vet, they took the kid. You've got to believe me. I swear. Why should I? Call the vet, ask him. I used my credit card. Ah! What's the matter, you scared? Feel trapped? Look, let us go and we won't say a word. I promise. I don't think Fritz would like that. You can do what you want to me, just let her go. Well, isn't that good of you? You should've thought about protecting Ebin. Alright. Who? Who's gonna tell me what happened? I wasn't there. We didn't do anything to him. Tell him! - Tell me what? - We're sorry about your brother. No. Sorry is not good enough. Someone has got to pay. It was an accident. Accident? Accident? It was an accident? An accident? What kind of a fucking accident-- Okay, wait a minute now. Take them to the car. I need a minute. Let go. I got to talk to you. This is fucking wasting my time. T! So what now? He'll let us go? Yeah, the show is over. Really had me going there for a second. Give me a cigarette. I don't take orders from you. Oh, a big man like you shouldn't take orders from anyone. Can't you even give me a cigarette without Fritz telling you to? Better shut your mouth or I'll do it. Promises, promises. That the best you can do? Where are you going? What, are you fucking crazy? I can't believe her. Don't know what's so damn funny. Otis can get pretty mean with a belt. Oh, it's not funny. It's just... Genevieve's always talking about getting tied up. Yeah, they're a match made in heaven. Um, I want to thank you for back there. What makes you think I did it for you? I know. I can tell you're a nice guy deep down. That's why you let me go. Ah, I can't do that, not even if I wanted to. Promise me that you won't let your friend hurt me. You're safe with me, Red. Why do you act so crazy? Ah, hell, I don't know. You know what they say? No, what's that? The fun's all in the chase. Beat ya! Damn. You're a pretty fast runner, Red. I bet you can squeeze them legs pretty good too, huh? Wait a minute. C'mon, Red. You didn't run me all the way out here for nothing. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, I think you do. Get away from me. Why are you acting like an animal? Oh... Because I am an animal. You really are something. I am, huh? Don't get to meet many girls like you. - Well, now you have. - Yes, I have. Do something about it. You gotta stop telling me what to do. What are you laughing at? Guys love to fuck me. It's my power. You smart ass rich bitch. You get whatever you want... well, not from me. I wouldn't fuck you if you begged me. You can't talk to me like that. No one ever say no to you before? How's it feel not to be good enough? I'm good enough. I'm good enough! Where are you going? Look at me. Look at me! You said I was beautiful. Everybody says I'm beautiful. I see right through you. You look like you've got everything, but you've got nothing. You're pathetic. I get it. You're scared. What's the matter, big man, are you scared that you're not good enough for me? What's the matter, big man, haven't you got it in you? Huh? What's the matter, big man... can't you do anything without Fritz telling you to? Fuck Fritz. I don't need Fritz to tell me what to do with you. Then do it. Come on. Do it. What's that do for you? Ooh, not enough. How about this, ah? You like that? Come on, why don't you try it? I don't wanna do that. Come on. Pretty please. That's not so bad, huh? It's your turn. Don't touch me! Well, honey, either you do it or I'll do it. Let me help you. You know, Red, you act like you ain't never done this before. Well, it ain't no big deal. I mean, ah, you know, ain't you afraid you're going to get hit by a bus or something before you get a chance to do it? Huh? Got a raincoat in my wallet. You filthy pig. I'm a hog for you, baby. I know I should have told someone. I didn't. I'm sorry about what happened to your brother. I'd give anything for that not to have happened. There's nothing you can do about it now. You're not going to get away with it. The sheriff will believe me. We've been through all that. They'll arrest you, not them. It's not fair. I know. That's just the way it is. How is that? How is it? Otis. Otis! ♪ Slippin' into darkness Hey, Otis. Hey, listen, guy, I changed my mind. I decided we're going to take it to the sheriff. But you said... I said they had to pay. Well, I cashed one in for you. Genevieve? ♪ ...into darkness What does that mean? She's dead. Oh, man. ♪ When I heard my mother say It's what she wanted. It's what you wanted. ♪ You've been Slippin' into darkness ♪ ♪ Wo ho ho ho ♪ Pretty soon you gonna pay Genevieve. Genevieve, come on. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Genevieve. Why do you push so far? Why? Hey she's dead, honey. Come on, she's gone. Hey, she ain't coming back. Shit! Come on, come on. Come on down. Come on. Goddamn it, I hate you! Goddamn you. Come on, now, this isn't going to solve a thing. Now, come on. Come on. I hope you're satisfied. Your brother's still dead. Now you know how it feels. -Oh, you sick fuck. -Sit down. Takes one to know one. I was wrong, man. Don't worry, I'll fix it. You fixed enough, man! This is bullshit! Bullshit. I don't believe this. Alright, Fritz. Now it's your call. Now, what're we gonna do? What are we gonna do about her? Put her in here. Busy night, huh? Working the graveyard shift, T. "Eugene S. Peters, 1845 to 1861." Well, not bad. She ought to be real cozy with him in here. What do you think? It's great, just great. Why don't you open it up? I'll get her in here. What the hell is happening to you? I think they look good together. - No! - Get her out of here! - Come on, come on. - Get her out of here! Get off, man! Don't, don't look at it, honey. Did you have to do it that way? Ashes to ashes. Hey, enough! Stop it! - It's all right. - Come on. Come on. Hey, hey. Now what? This isn't what I wanted. I wished I believed that. Look, I've been running around like a real asshole saying somebody's gotta pay. But, I never really meant for anybody to get hurt. Otis, we're gonna get you some cash and get you out of here. We're out of gas. Ah, no shit! It's like driving a popcorn fart. My fuckin' mother. So this is the end of the road. Relax. Relax. I see a house up there, we'll bum some gas. I'll send the girls, no sweat. They'll sell me out. I've seen the way they look at me. I'll go with 'em. Leave one here. So what's happening? Come on, we'll bum some gas. No problem. No problem. No problem. He won't hurt her, will he? No, don't worry. So, what do I say? Just Say we're going to the, ah-- The Bible Gardens, they're out this way. The what? It's statues and stuff from scenes in the Bible. We'll say we're a Bible study class. You do the talking. What is it? Nothing. I think they're out back. Something's going down. They go inside or what? They're gonna sell us out, man. Oh, Otis! Come on. Yeah, oh, yeah, that's good. That's good. Run! Run! Run! He's really starting to get fucked now. - Will you stop? - No! - Don't be afraid! - Let go! I said I'd give him a chance. Need a chance to get out of here. A chance? What about me? Alex? What about Genevieve, did she have a chance? No! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey! Hey! I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. Listen, but, we got to go back. -We got to. -No. He thinks we're gone, let's just go. Let's just go. I know, but your friend is still with him. T-Bone can't stop him. Do we just leave her? No, no. I promise you, I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. Nothing is gonna happen to you. You understand me? Okay? Okay? Yeah. Okay? Okay. Come on in. Welcome home. Hey, man, check this out. There's food in this refrigerator. You know, I got an egg here. This damn bread's still fresh too. Anybody hungry? How about you? Me? Are you hungry? Hey, hey. Have you ever had egg in the hole? Fun. "I was born in this bed in this house. No man can take that away." Yes, sir. It's a shit world. See? What's that do for you, huh? Oh, what is it? I told you, it's called an egg in the hole. You probably know it as a toad in the hole. I don't know. Some people say that. It just depends on where you're from. I think you got the heat on too. No, no, now, why don't you go on and sit down? Let me do something. I said to get out of my kitchen. Okay. Hi. Ah, you guys come back for breakfast? Are you cooking? No, I'm a can of smashed assholes. I should have kept running. Yeah, you shoulda. It's hard to be prepared for these times. What times? When you just sit. You know... when you just sit... and think. Well, you don't have to just sit there. Is that right? Yeah, it's right. We can go on, man. We can get you some money, get you out of it. Oh, I think I'm out of it already. Where'd you get the gun? A friend. A friend. Otis. You know I'm with you. We're all with you. Why you looking at her? You don't mean shit to her. I gave you my word. Your word don't mean shit anymore. Otis, you got-- You ran out on me. You ran out on us. Well, I ain't doing this for you. This one's for Ebin. It's for Ebin. T-Bone! Yeah, Otis? Finish cooking. Are you alright? - Oh, man. - Yep. I need something for his face. Just use this. All right. Yeah. T-Bone! Let's go. I just saw him go in the barn, let's go. - What? - Let's go! -I can't just leave him here. -Why not? He's psychotic. He is not. It's just that everybody's teamed up against him. He feels like he's trapped. We're the ones that are trapped. He'll kill all of us. Now, listen to me. I'm telling you, he'd never turn on a brother. I am not a brother. He would kill me in a second. You don't owe him anything. Go, go! Come on, run! Stay down, stay down low. Stay down. Alright, it looks like it's hard to turn. You three split up. I'll circle back behind him. - Okay. - Move! Help! T-Bone! Shit! Otis, man. You got to stop this, man. This is crazy. It's me, man. Stop this. What the fuck's wrong with you? It's a shit world, T-Bone. T-Bone! Carlyle, help me. I'm gone. Hey, Red, you want to go with me? Alex, you can't just leave like this. Hey, Boner, take care. Alright, man. Let's go. I'm gonna turn myself in. We have to tell somebody about all this. Do you think this just happened to you? What about how I feel? You know, when I look at you, I can almost forget. Until this thing dies down, we can be together. If you want to. Yeah, I want to. Then, if you go to the sheriff, you'll ruin it for us. But, I have no choice. Yes, you do. T-Bone, tell the sheriff he did it. No way, no fucking way. He just left you holding the whole bag. And, he left with the girl who killed your brother. Don't you see if you don't do it, we'll never be together? Don't you understand? I can't do that. It's the only way. Give me the sheriff, please. I want to be with you. I love you. Carlyle! Come in the den, please, -There someone here to see you. -Shit! -Carlyle. -I've just been telling the sheriff you've been visiting my brother this weekend. Isn't that right, Carlyle? Who wants lemonade? It's fresh. Excuse me. What about it, Miss Manigault? I was at my uncle's house for the weekend. You're such a liar. You can't get away with this. I'm sorry about this thing, Manigault. Oh, don't mention it. Always glad to help. What did I tell you, though? Sister here never disobeys her daddy. Thank you. Well, thank you. -Bye. -Bye. Fritz! Fritz, are you in there? It's me, Alex. Fritz. Fritz. Fritz. They arrested me and T-Bone for killing Genevieve and Otis. They got me out on bail, but, you know, he's just sitting in there. Yeah, but by looking at you, uh... seems like I'm not telling you something you didn't know. Would you? He would never do that to you. That's why he's sitting back there because he would never do that to you. She and everything she has isn't worth this shit. Who are you to come in here and accuse me of anything? After what... After what you did to my brother. What I did to your brother? What the hell are you talking about? You mean what Carlyle did to your brother. Get out. Don't you wanna know what really happened that night? If only we hadn't been drinking and hit your brother's dog, none of this would've happened. Carlyle's gonna die when she sees the vet bill. - Where is she anyway? - I don't know. I always preferred ice cream to books myself. Don't tell me you left my poor daughter at the library by herself. -No. -No. She's meeting us here in... -Five minutes. -She should be here any... She's a big girl. I trust her. -What's he doing here? -Eating ice cream. No, it's too weird. He's looking for Carlyle. She's down at the railroad tracks, go look for her. Okay. So, I went to find Carlyle. But, if I knew then what I would find, I never would have gone. Cher... cherries. Carlyle told me she'd been keeping some guy secret from her father but I couldn't believe it was your brother. Stay here. Alex, wait! -Your father's looking for you. -Just wait. Please don't say anything. If my father-- Is that all you ever think about is yourself? What about that poor kid? It's not what you think. We really like each other. Oh, really? Yes, really. I like him. He doesn't try to control me or change me. Alex, he's the guy I've been seeing and he's the only one I could keep secret from my father. Well, you're screwed now because there he is. Lylie. Alex. I'm so tired of covering up for you, so why don't you just deal with your own shit? Love Ebin? I wanted to tell someone, but Carlyle said if I did she'd tell everyone I did it. I tried to get Ebin off the tracks, but I was too late. Ebin! Sorry. Get out. There's just something I wanna know. How'd she get you to sell T-Bone out? Did she tell you she loved you? Believe me, you're not the first. What are you doing here? Is something wrong? You tell me. No, nothing's wrong. It's just that I... I thought we agreed not to see each other for a while. So, it won't be for long. Come on, you'd better go. If my father catches you... Come on. It's safe. This look familiar? No. Well, it should. You gave it to my brother. No, I didn't. I checked. Alright, I gave it to him. What's wrong with that? What did he have to do for it? Nothing. It was a present. You mean a bribe, don't you? No! -You killed him. -No, I didn't. Please, my father did. He caught me with Ebin and he killed him. He loves me. He loves me more than he loves my mother. What are you doing? Calling the sheriff. No, he won't believe you. No, but he'll believe you. I can't tell him. Don't make me, you love me. Yeah, maybe I do. You know you do. And, I love you. Yeah. And... just how many times have you said that? I never felt this way before. You have to believe me. That's the sad thing, I do. Don't try to fight my father. You can't win. A brother never turns on a brother. He'll throw you in jail, too. Well, I won't mind 'cause I know you'll be waiting. Hang it up. What are you doing here? She told me everything. What did you tell him? I didn't tell him anything, Daddy. You tell him or I will. What did you tell him, sister? Shoot him, Daddy. He knows about you. He knows about us. Shoot him! Don't worry, Daddy. Sister will make it all better. No one will ever know. No, Carlyle. No!
