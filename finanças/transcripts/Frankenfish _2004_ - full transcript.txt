[boat engine stops] [boat engine starting] [engine stopping] WHAT THE... [gasping] [yelling] [gasping] (Abrams) SOME HUNTERS FOUND THE BODY ABOUT AN HOUR AGO. NO I.D. PROBABLY BEEN DEAD A COUPLE OF DAYS. THESE WOUNDS ARE POST-MORTEM. BUT SOMETHING WAS DEFINITELY... DEFINITELY CHEWING ON HER AFTER SHE WAS DUMPED HERE. HEY, SAM, WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE? I'D SAY WE GOT OURSELVES A HOMICIDE. SEE THAT BLOOD? IT WAS SMEARED ON. PROBABLY CHICKEN BLOOD. GREAT. YOU DON'T THINK IT WAS ONE OF THOSE VOODOO THINGS, DO YOU? NO, THE CHICKEN BLOOD'S THERE TO ATTRACT PIGS. A FEW FERAL RAZORBACKS COULD GET RID OF A CORPSE IN LESS THAN A WEEK. YOU KNOW WHAT KILLED HER? PROBABLY BLUNT-FORCE TRAUMA, JUDGING BY THE CRANIAL BRUISIN'. BUT I'LL KNOW MORE AFTER I GET SOME RESULTS, RUN SOME TESTS. LET ME GRAB MY KIT. ABRAMS IS GOING TO HAVE TO HANDLE THIS ONE ON HIS OWN. I NEED YOU TO RUN DOWN TO OTLEY. OTLEY? WHAT FOR? THEY PULLED WHAT WAS LEFT OF A BODY OUT OF THE SWAMP DOWN THERE. IT'S CHEWED UP REAL BAD, BUT SOMETHIN' AIN'T RIGHT. THE LOCAL SHERIFF PUT IN A REQUEST FOR A MEDICAL EXAMINER. LISTEN, CHIEF, HOW ABOUT I STAY HERE? LET'S SEND ABRAMS DOWN, GRAB A FEW PHOTOS... FIRST OF ALL, YOU KNOW THOSE SWAMP RATS WON'T EVEN TALK TO OUTSIDERS. AND HELL, ABRAMS AIN'T EVEN FROM THE SOUTH. YEAH, BUT, CHIEF, I... I REALLY DON'T... SECOND OF ALL, YOU'RE THE EXPERT AT THIS KIND OF THING. ABRAMS AIN'T. [police radio chattering] ALL RIGHT. [birds chirping] TELL 'EM I'LL BE THERE BY 8:00. I ALREADY DID. [whispering] THANK YOU. ABRAMS. CALL THE STATE LAB. SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY PORCINE CASTS OR X-RAYS ON FILE. YEAH, SURE. UH, PORC... PORCINE. MEANS PIG, EINSTEIN. (Sam) CALL ME IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. OTLEY. SHIT. [door closing] NOT A PRETTY SIGHT, IS IT? LOOKS LIKE HE'S BEEN IN THE WATER FOR 48 HOURS, GIVE OR TAKE. THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT. HE WAS MISSIN' FOR A DAY AND A NIGHT. YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS GUY? NOT A LOT. NAME'S JOHN CRANKTON. AGE 57, 165 POUNDS. DID YOU, UH, PUT A VERDICT DOWN ON THE CAUSE OF DEATH YET? MMM-HMM. ALLIGATOR ATTACK. THEN WHY CALL IN AN M.E.? BECAUSE THESE DON'T LOOK LIKE ANY 'GATOR BITES I'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE. THEY'RE NOT. ALLIGATOR TEETH ARE TOO SHORT AND BLUNT TO CAUSE THIS KIND OF DAMAGE. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO VISIT THE SCENE. WHERE'D THEY FIND THE BODY? WAY OUT IN THE DEEP SWAMP. YOU GOT A PHONE AROUND HERE? SURE. RIGHT OUTSIDE. [trunk lid closing] (Mary) HELLO, YOU SAM RIVERS? THAT WOULD BE ME. YOU THE BIOLOGIST? MARY CALLAHAN. DEPARTMENT OF WILDLIFE AND FISHERIES. NICE TO MEET YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO. THANK YOU FOR COMIN' OUT HERE ON, UH, SUCH SHORT NOTICE. NO PROBLEM. [Sam sighing] SO, YOU READY? YEAH, LET'S DO IT. [engine starts] JUDGING BY THE MAP, WE'VE GOT ABOUT A 4 OR 5-HOUR RIDE AHEAD OF US. I'D SAY ABOUT THAT. WATER? NO, I'VE GOT SOME COLD ONES IN THE COOLER, IF YOU WANT. HELP YOURSELF. OK. THANKS. I DIDN'T KNOW MEDICAL EXAMINERS CARRIED GUNS. OH, I DON'T USUALLY CARRY ONE, BUT I DON'T LIKE GOIN' OUT TO A POTENTIAL CRIME SCENE WHERE I CAN'T CALL FOR HELP. WE'VE GOT A RADIO. WHERE WE'RE GOIN', NOTHIN' WORKS OUT THERE. (Mary) YOU SEEM TO KNOW YOUR WAY AROUND THESE PARTS PRETTY WELL. YOU GET A LOT OF SWAMP MURDERS? (Sam) NO. NO, NOT REALLY. WHEN IT COMES TO KILLIN' PEOPLE, THE SWAMP DOESN'T NEED ANY HELP. YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT SOME PHOTOS OF THE BODY AND TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK? YEAH, SURE. OH, MY GOD. [Sam chuckling] (Sam) IS THAT YOUR PROFESSIONAL OPINION? IT'S EXTREMELY UNLIKELY THAT AN ALLIGATOR COULD HAVE DONE THIS. SHARK, MAYBE. YEAH, THAT WAS MY FIRST THOUGHT. BUT WE'RE A LITTLE TOO FAR UPRIVER FOR A GREAT WHITE, AREN'T WE? YEAH, BUT NOT FOR A BULL SHARK. THEY'RE EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE MAN-EATERS. THAT COULD BE THE GUY WE'RE LOOKIN' FOR. HEY, STOP THE BOAT. THAT'S STRANGE. THE NOISE FROM THE BOAT SHOULD HAVE SCARED IT OFF. THAT 'GATOR DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT. [engine stops] [fly buzzing] [frogs croaking] (Mary) JESUS. LOOK HOW RAGGED THE STUMP IS. IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS TORN OFF. YOU THINK A BOAT PROPELLER COULD HAVE DONE THAT? NO BOAT THIS BIG COULD HAVE TRAVELED THAT FAR UP THE BAYOU. WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED, THEN? PROBABLY SOME REDNECK POACHER'S IDEA OF A JOKE. COME ON. WE'RE ALMOST THERE. [engine running] [engine stops] (Mary) WHAT'S HAPPENING? IS HE OK? YEAH. SHH, WATCH. [birds chirping] [laughing] OH, SHE'S A BEAUTY. YOU GOT THAT RIGHT. IS IT BITING YOU? HELL, YEAH. SOME STRANGE FELLA STICK HIS HAND IN YOUR HOLE, WOULDN'T YOU BITE HIM? [laughing] THIS IS LIKE THE DARK SIDE OF HEE HAW. WE'RE LOOKIN' FOR WHERE JOHN CRANKTON LIVED. WHAT Y'ALL WANT WITH OLD JOHN? JOHN'S DEAD. YEAH, WE KNOW HE'S DEAD. WE'RE HERE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED. Y'ALL COPS? MY NAME'S SAM RIVERS. I'M A MEDICAL EXAMINER. THIS IS MARY CALLAHAN, DEPARTMENT OF WILDLIFE AND FISHERIES. I GOT ME A LICENSE. I REALLY DOUBT THEY ISSUE A LICENSE TO DO THAT. FISTING A CATFISH? WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO JOHN. I WASN'T THERE. RICARDO BROUGHT HIM BACK. HE WAS WRAPPED UP IN A TARP OR SOMETHING. WELL, WE'D LIKE TO TALK TO RICARDO, AND ANYONE ELSE WHO MAY HAVE KNOWN JOHN. YOU TOW ME UPSTREAM A MILE OR 2. I'LL INTRODUCE YOU TO SOME FOLKS. OK. GOD, WHO WOULD WANT TO LIVE SO FAR AWAY FROM EVERYTHING? HEY, PARDNER, PULL UP OVER THERE. WHOSE HOUSEBOAT IS THAT? THAT'S MY NIECE AND HER NAKED HUSBAND. IT'S ONE THING TO BE MARRIED TO IT, BUT TO HAVE TO LOOK AT IT WHILE YOU'RE EATIN'... (Sam) AND WHO LIVES IN THOSE? (Elmer) THAT HOUSE OVER THERE ON THE LEFT, THAT'S RICARDO'S. AND THE GREEN ONE, THAT'S GLORIA'S, JOHN'S WIFE. OH, ROLAND! BOBBI! COME ON DOWN HERE. THERE'S SOME PEOPLE WHO WANT TO MEET YOU. (Roland) HI, THERE. THIS MAN'S SORT OF A COP. HE WANTS TO TALK TO Y'ALL ABOUT OLD JOHN. OH, LORD, IT'S AWFUL. I'VE GOT TO SEE A MAN ABOUT A BAG OF SQUIRRELS AND A MESS OF FISH. EITHER OF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO MR. CRANKTON? YOU KNOW, WE FEEL REAL SAD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO JOHN. BUT, I... I... (Elmer) HEY, RICARDO! I FEEL REAL BAD ABOUT WHAT'S GOIN' TO HAPPEN TO THAT GATOR BECAUSE RICARDO OVER THERE, HE'S GOING TO GET IT AND IT AIN'T GOIN' TO BE PRETTY. NOW, RICARDO, HE'S THE ONE WHO FOUND THE BODY, RIGHT? UH-HUH. HE DOESN'T TALK MUCH. AND SINCE JOHN DIED... YEAH, THEY WERE IN VIETNAM TOGETHER. (Sam) WE'D LIKE TO TALK TO MRS. CRANKTON, TOO. GO AHEAD. (Bobbi) UH, ELMER SHOULD INTRODUCE YOU, BEING THAT HE'S HER BROTHER-IN-LAW AND ALL. ELMER, WE'D LIKE TO TALK TO RICARDO. RICARDO AIN'T TALKIN' TO NOBODY. HOW ABOUT GLORIA? WELL, COME ON, WE'LL SEE. [knocking on door] (Eliza) HI, ELMER. COMMENT CA VA, CHERE? I'M FINE, AND YOU? I HATE TO BOTHER YOU, BUT IS YOUR MAMA IN THE HOUSE? YEAH, SHE'S IN THERE. YOU WANT TO COME IN? [door closing] ELIZA, YOUR MOTHER WILL NOT LET ME PACK UP THE SHRINE. IT MUSTN'T BE MOVED FROM THIS SPOT. THEY NEED ITS POWER HERE. DAN, IF SHE DOESN'T WANT TO MOVE THE ALTAR, CAN WE JUST LEAVE IT THERE? THAT'S FINE, I JUST... YOU KNOW, I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF COMING ALL THE WAY OUT HERE TO HELP YOUR MOTHER MOVE IF SHE DOESN'T ACTUALLY WANT TO TAKE ANYTHING WITH HER. THERE'S SOME PEOPLE WHO WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT JOHN. EXCUSE ME, MA'AM. SORRY TO BOTHER YOU. I KNOW THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. BUT WE'RE HERE TO INVESTIGATE THE DEATH OF YOUR HUSBAND, JOHN CRANKTON. WE'RE HOPING TO GET A LOOK AT WHERE JOHN'S BODY WAS FOUND. YOU'RE ALL THEY SENT? JUST THE TWO OF YOU? [snickering] DAMN FOOL. MA. SIT. THERE'S BEEN A CURSE PUT ON THIS PLACE LIKE NONE I'VE EVER SEEN. IT COME WITH THE STORM AND THE BOAT, AND IT'S BEEN WITH US EVER SINCE. I'VE TRIED TO KEEP IT AWAY, BUT... MY CIRCLE OF PROTECTION IS SMALL, AND I TOLD JOHN NOT TO STEP OUTSIDE OF IT. BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT KILLED JOHN. BUT I DO KNOW IT'S NOT FROM THIS SWAMP. APPARENTLY, AFTER HURRICANE GARRICK, THEY FOUND A STRANGE BOAT A FEW MILES UPSTREAM. MAMA SAID THAT'S WHEN ALL THE CRAZY STUFF STARTED TO HAPPEN. LIKE THE FISH GETTING SCARCE. I'VE NEVER SEEN IT MYSELF. THIS BOAT, CAN YOU SHOW IT TO US? NO, I... I CAN'T GO THERE. MY CIRCLE IS WHAT'S KEEPING THAT THING AWAY. ELMER CAN TAKE YOU. OH, CHERE, I'M FISHIN'... ELMER, I... I WARNED YOU. [sighing] I KNOW WHAT YOU THINK: "THIS CRAZY OLD WITCH." I NEVER SAID... I'M GETTIN' OUT OF HERE. AND ONCE I'M GONE, THERE WON'T BE NOTHIN' TO KEEP THAT EVIL THING AWAY. WELL, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. YOU STOP IT. YOU STOP IT NOW, BEFORE ANYONE ELSE DIES. TAKE THESE WITH YOU. THANKS. BYE, CHERE. HEY, WHAT IS THIS THING? OH, IT'S JUST SOME CRAZY OLD VOODOO STUFF. JUST PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET. HI. HI. HEY, Y'ALL WANT SOME FRUIT? NO, THANKS. GUESS NOT, HUH? GOT NO SHAME, THEM TWO. THIS PLACE USED TO HAVE SOME DECENCY. COME ON, HAVE A BANANA. HMM. HERE, BABY. OH! NO, I DON'T WANT A BANANA. [frogs croaking] WHAT'S A BOAT THAT SIZE DOING WAY UP IN THE SWAMP? I HAVE NO IDEA. (Elmer) NOW, I JUST OFFERED TO SHOW Y'ALL THE BOAT. I NEVER SAID NOTHIN' ABOUT GETTIN' ON. YOU'VE BEEN ON IT BEFORE? NO. HOW LONG HAS THIS THING BEEN HERE? ABOUT 3 MONTHS. AND YOU'VE NEVER BEEN ABOARD ONCE? NOT EVEN TO LOOK FOR SOMETHIN' WORTH TAKIN'? NO. DID JOHN CRANKTON GO ABOARD? NEVER SAID HE DID. NEVER SAID HE DIDN'T. HEY, PARDNER. DON'T STAY TOO LONG. I DON'T PLAN TO BE OUT HERE ALL DAY. YEAH, WE'LL TRY NOT TO KEEP YOU AWAY FROM YOUR BUSY ROUTINE. (Sam) I WONDER WHY NO ONE HAS COME LOOKIN' FOR THIS THING. THIS BOAT HAD A CHINESE CREW. NOTHIN'S WORKIN' HERE. [beeping] (Sam) LET'S CHECK OUT THE HOLD. WHAT IS THAT SMELL? OH, SOMETHING'S ROTTEN. OOH. OH, GOD. [Mary sighing] [Sam exhaling] [beeping continues] FUCK. [water splashing] YOU BE CAREFUL. [flies buzzing] [camera flash whining] [camera clicking] (Sam) OH, MAN. YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH. [coughs] YEAH. I'M OK. [beeping] [camera clicking] JESUS. (Sam) DAMN. (Mary) WHAT? NOTHING. [sobbing] (Sam) YOU OK? YEAH. [coughs] I'M JUST... I'M NOT USUALLY THIS SQUEAMISH, BUT THAT SMELL WAS JUST... WHAT IS THIS? MY GOD, LOOK AT THIS. WHAT IS THIS? IT'S A FISH SCALE. ONLY I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE THAT BIG BEFORE. NOT EVEN CLOSE. NEITHER HAVE I. I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE. (Elmer) LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. WE'RE COMIN'. SLOW DOWN. TAKE YOUR TIME. WATCH YOUR HEAD. STEADY, MISS. STEADY, STEADY. [yelling] [chuckling] (Sam) ELMER, YOU OK? YEAH. YEAH. I'M SORRY, ELMER. IT'S ALL RIGHT, MISSY. EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE FINE. COME ON, ELMER. [yelling] [screaming] [screaming] [Mary screaming] [Elmer groaning] [panting] WHAT THE FUCK? WHAT WAS THAT? I DON'T KNOW. BUT WE'RE GETTING THE HELL OUT OF HERE. UNTIE THE BOAT. [engine starts] [engine revving] [knocking on door] OH, COME ON IN. YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN LOOKIN' IN THE WRONG FUCKIN' PLACE. [beeping] FUCKING IDIOTS. [tires squealing] [phone ringing] THIS BETTER BE GOOD. (Anton) IT'S ANTON. OH. I'M SORRY, BUTTERCUP. I'VE GOT TO TAKE THIS. ANTON. YOUR MERCHANDISE HAS BEEN LOCATED. FANTASTIC. WHERE IS IT? IT'S ABOUT 50 MILES DOWNRIVER. SO, WHAT HAPPENED? WE HAVE NO IDEA. WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE CARGO? DON'T KNOW. YOU'RE STARTIN' TO PISS ME OFF AGAIN, ANTON. [snarling] ALL RIGHT, I'LL HAVE MY BOYS GET THE BOAT READY. JEFF, COME ON. NONE... NONE OF YOUR GREAT WHITE HUNTER BULLSHIT, OK? LET ME JUST GET SOMEONE IN THERE TO CHECK IT OUT AND TAKE CARE OF THINGS. AFTER 3 MONTHS, THE CHANCES OF THAT CARGO... YEAH, YOU'RE GODDAMN STRAIGHT, "AFTER 3 MONTHS." (Jeff) YOU AND YOUR BOYS FUCKED IT UP LAST TIME. SO, I'M GOIN' TO GO DOWN THERE THIS TIME AND MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. EVEN IF THE CARGO SURVIVED WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT BOAT, THERE'S GATORS AND OTHER SHIT DOWN THERE... THERE'S NOT A GODDAMN THING IN THAT SWAMP THAT CAN TOUCH THEM. YOU GOT THAT? YEAH. SO, STOP BITCHING AND GET YOUR SKINNY ASS DOWN TO MY DOCK. [phone beeps] FUCK. I'M COMIN' FOR YOU, YOU BEAUTIFUL MOTHERFUCKERS. SO, YOU'RE SAYIN' THERE'S A, UH, SWAMP MONSTER OUT HERE KILLING PEOPLE? LOOK, THE ONLY THING THAT'S OUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT BELONG THERE. LOOK, ARE WE SAFE HERE? THAT BOAT IS ABOUT 3 MILES AWAY FROM HERE. (Mary) SINCE THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ANY ATTACKS DOWN HERE, IT WAS PROBABLY JUST TERRITORIAL. (Roland) YEAH, IF... IF WE DON'T BOTHER IT, I-I-IT WON'T BOTHER US. BOTHER US? IT KILLED MY DAD. IT JUST KILLED HER UNCLE. (Sam) LISTEN. IT'S TOO LATE TO MAKE IT BACK BEFORE DARK, AND IT'S TOO DANGEROUS TO GO AT NIGHT. BUT AT FIRST LIGHT, MARY AND I WILL HEAD BACK AND GET SOME HELP TO TAKE CARE OF THIS. WELL, WHAT'S DONE IS DONE. MAMA. (Dan) YOU KNOW, THIS IS RIDICULOUS. ANTON. GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT. MY PILOT WANTS TO KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOIN'. I'VE GOT IT MAPPED OUT. WHO'S OUR FRIEND HERE, JEFF? AND WHAT'S WITH ALL THE EQUIPMENT? ANTON, MEET BEN. HOW ARE YOU? WE'VE ALREADY BEEN ON A COUPLE OF HUNTS TOGETHER. HELL YES, I'VE KILLED AND TRACKED JUST ABOUT ANY GODDAMN THING YOU CAN THINK OF. [thudding] THIS AIN'T A FUCKING GAME, JEFF. YOU'RE GODDAMN STRAIGHT ABOUT THAT. IT'S A HUNT. NOW, COME ON, MAN. [engine starting] (Sam) WHAT ARE WE DEALIN' WITH? WELL, IT'S CLEARLY CARNIVOROUS WHICH RIGHT THERE NARROWS IT DOWN TO ABOUT 4 OR 5 FISH ON THE PLANET. YEAH, BUT LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THIS SCALE. HOW THE HELL DID IT GET SO BIG? IT'S THE BAYOU. SWAMP'S A WILD PLACE. UNLESS YOU ACCEPT THAT, YOU AIN'T GETTIN' OUT OF HERE ALIVE. THE... THAT THING THAT KILLED JOHN THINKS IT'S KING OUT HERE. BUT IT AIN'T. I'LL KILL IT. I SWEAR TO GOD, I WILL. DINNER'S READY. AND Y'ALL GOT TO EAT. I MADE GUMBO. THAT INCLUDES YOU, RICARDO. ISN'T HE AFRAID OF WHATEVER IS OUT THERE? [snickering] RICARDO AIN'T SCARED OF ANYTHING. THERE'S WORSE THINGS THAN DYIN'. (Gloria) WE ASK YOU TO PROTECT US FROM THE EVIL THAT LURKS HERE. AND WE ASK ALSO THAT YOU TAKE ELMER UPON YOUR WINGS AND YOU CARRY HIM HOME. AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. (Sam) AMEN. HERE YOU GO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SAM? NO. NO, THANKS. THIS IS EXCELLENT, GLORIA. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME, YOUNG MAN. IT'S... IT'S NICE TO MAKE A BIG MEAL EVERY NOW AND THEN. SNAPPIN' TURTLE? WHY, YES. (Mary) EXCUSE ME. [coughs] IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME. WH-WHERE DID YOU SAY YOU WERE FROM AGAIN? OH, WELL, UM, ACTUALLY I GREW UP AROUND HERE, IN OTLEY. YOU DIDN'T HAPPEN TO GO TO BIENVENU HIGH, DID YOU? (Sam) YEAH, I DID. I MOVED TO NEW ORLEANS MIDDLE OF MY SENIOR YEAR, BUT I WAS CLASS OF '91. THIS IS CRAZY. I'M ELIZA DESIRE. I USED TO POUR GATORADE AT ALL THE FOOTBALL GAMES. RIGHT. WELL, OF COURSE, I REMEMBER. WELL, YOU SURE MUST HAVE LOVED FOOTBALL. YOU NEVER MISSED A PRACTICE. IS THIS THE BOY YOU TOLD ME ABOUT? UH-UH, NO, MOTHER. BECAUSE I REMEMBER, HIS NAME WAS SAM SOMETHING AND HE LEFT TOWN. SHE HAD A CRUSH ON THIS ONE BOY IN HIGH SCHOOL. SHE ASKED ME TO PUT MAGIC ON HIM ONCE. REALLY? (Gloria) OH, YEAH. OF COURSE, YOU CAN'T DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR A GIRL THAT AGE. NOT THAT IT WOULD HAVE TURNED OUT ANY WORSE, MIND YOU. OK, YOU KNOW, THAT'S REALLY NICE. THAT COMMENT'S ABOUT ME, ISN'T IT? THAT'S JUST LOVELY. [clears throat] (Eliza) WOULD YOU GUYS EXCUSE US FOR A MINUTE, PLEASE? EXCUSE ME. [door closing] DAN, YOU'RE BEING RUDE. YOU'RE A GUEST IN MY MAMA'S HOUSE... LOOK, I'M SORRY, OK? I DIDN'T EXPECT TO SPEND MY DAY OFF BOBBING AROUND ON A RAFT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SWAMP. (Eliza) I TOLD YOU WHERE I WAS FROM. ELIZA, I THOUGHT YOUR MOTHER LIVED IN A CABIN OFF SOME RIVER. THIS GUMBO IS REALLY GOOD, GLORIA. OH, THANK YOU. (Eliza) IT WAS NOT! UM, WOULD YOU LIKE SOME TEA? DAN, I DIDN'T ASK FOR YOUR HELP. YOU OFFERED IT TO ME. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. I OFFERED BECAUSE YOU IMPLIED THAT MY ASSISTANCE WAS ESSENTIAL IN ORDER FOR OUR DATING RELATIONSHIP TO PROGRESS. AND YOU KNEW I HAD A MOTORBOAT, SWEETHEART. THE REQUEST WAS THEREFORE IMPLICIT. IT WAS NOT. [dishes rattling] I SHOULD HAVE NEVER HOOKED UP WITH A LAWYER. [door opening] [door closing] SHOULD HAVE NEVER DATED SWAMP-GIRL. [sighs] MORE TURTLE SOUP. [bottles clinking] OH, YOU KNOW, I COULD USE ANOTHER BEER. THANK YOU. THAT'S JUST GREAT. HEY. THANKS. [sighs] I'M A PARALEGAL IN HIS OFFICE. WHY DO YOU PUT UP WITH HIM? BECAUSE I'M A PARALEGAL IN HIS OFFICE. WELL, YOU DESERVE SOMEONE WHO'S NEVER LIKE THAT. SOMEONE WHO WILL MASSAGE YOUR FEET AFTER A LONG DAY, COOK YOU A NICE DINNER, READ YOU POETRY. SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY VALUES YOU, INSTEAD OF SOME JERK WHO COMES HOME EXPECTING A BLOWJOB. YEAH, WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO FIND A GUY LIKE THAT? WHO SAYS I'M TALKING ABOUT A GUY? BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY. MAN OR WOMAN, YOU STILL END UP SPENDING THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME WITH YOUR HEAD STUCK BETWEEN SOMEONE'S LEGS. SAM, WHAT YOU DRINKING? OH, JUST SOME TEA YOUR MOTHER MADE ME.

IT MUST HAVE FOLLOWED US BACK FROM THE WRECK. (Mary) IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT. IT'S AN ANIMAL. IT'S DOING WHAT ANIMALS DO. IT'S NO MORE EVIL THAN ANY OTHER PREDATOR. SHE'S RIGHT. WE'VE GOT TO GET OFF THE WATER. DAN, START YOUR BOAT. IT'S THE BIGGEST AND THE FASTEST, WE MAY OUTRUN IT. FUCK YOU, BUDDY. I'M NOT GETTIN' IN THAT THING. DID YOU SEE WHAT IT JUST DID TO BOBBI?

Y'ALL BEEN EATING GENETICALLY ENGINEERED SALMON FOR YEARS AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW IT. SOME OF MY FRIENDS JUST TOOK IT ONE STEP FURTHER. THIS IS THE RESULT. EXPLAIN TO ME, WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? WELL, SON... I'M NOT YOUR SON. THERE'S NO THRILL TO COMPARE WITH HUNTIN' SOMETHIN' THAT CAN HUNT YOU BACK. WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF CREATIN' SOMETHIN' THAT'S NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE, AND SOMETHIN' THAT'S NEVER BEEN HUNTED BEFORE, THAT'S A ONCE-IN- A-LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY, AND I TOOK IT. THAT'S FUCKING CRAZY. YO! YO! THERE SHE BLOWS! YOU HIT IT? YOU HIT IT? (Jeff) YEAH, I GOT IT. IT'S GONNA BE OK NOW. [sighs] [thudding] (Anton) LOOK, WE'VE WAITED LONG ENOUGH.
