Kimi no Na wa (Always in My Heart) Part 1 and 2 Summary On the night of the air raid Machiko met Haruki. They promised to meet each other six months hence and said good-bye on Sukiya Bridge. Six months passed. But Machiko did not come. And a year... 18 months passed and on a foggy fall night they finally met at Sukiya Bridge. However... Machiko was engaged to Katsunori Hamaguchi. Machiko's marriage was not a happy one. On a rainy night, Machiko left Katsunori and returned to Sado. But Machiko was pregnant with Katsunori's child. Senkaku Bay I was going to divorce Hamaguchi. I vowed never to go back to that house again. That was my intention when I left. Machiko. If you want to leave him that much I'll never let anyone have you. I came here to get you. Haruki. What am I to do? I'm with child. And then... Haruki... went to Hokkaido, and Machiko to Tokyo. But what awaited Machiko was the animosity of her mother-in-law. Machiko, I heard you had a miscarriage. You must feel better... in more ways than one. Mother, that's so cruel. Machiko, more determined to divorce, left Katsunori again. She headed for Hokkaido But... You want me to leave because that woman came from Tokyo. I won't leave. If I do, she'll take Haruki from me. If I can't have Haruki, I'll die. Yumi dies Katsunori sues for restoration of conjugal rights Hokkaido in the snow. Machiko and Haruki parted in sadness once again at Bihoro. Haruki. We'll meet again? I have a feeling I'll never see you again. Machiko. Let's be strong. Yes. Take care. You, too. And now... KIMI NO NA WA Part 3 (Always in My Heart Part 3) Cast KEIJI SADA KEIKO KISHI CHIKAGE AWASHIMA YUMEJI TSUKIOKA YUJI KAWAKITA TOSHIKO KOBAYASHI Director: HIDEO OBA Tokyo Family Court I have been asking for a divorce for some time. Since he wouldn't agree, I went to Hokkaido. My husband sued me. And that's why I asked the court for arbitration. I see. Judge, what do you think? The husband wants reconciliation, the wife wants a divorce. These two matters should be arbitrated at the same time. I agree. I think that's best for them both. Mr. Hamaguchi? I think you should just rule on my claim. There's no merit in her divorce application. She left her husband's house and went to see another man. An adulterous wife should have no say. I never did anything improper. - Oh, really? - No. You traveled to far away Hokkaido. Where's the proof you didn't commit adultery? It's a natural assumption. Calm down. Don't get so emotional. He's right. When you get emotional, nothing can be settled amicably. The person that was mentioned, is he the Mr. Atomiya that's in your petition? Yes. - And is he still in Hokkaido? - Yes. He should be in Tokyo next month. I initiated a defamation suit in civil court against him. If I can I'm considering additional charges of kidnapping, a criminal act. No! Dear? What are you doing? I think he's responsible. It seems you're very adamant about this. Yes, I am the victim. I see. I have some more questions for your wife, so will you wait outside? In any case, isn't it true that if you divorce your husband, you'll want to marry Mr. Atomiya? Yes. But that's not a legitimate reason. You have no intention of returning to your husband? No. But it seems your husband still loves you. But he won't trust me. Didn't you do things to lose his trust? No. I tried really hard to have him trust me. You have no idea how hard I tried. But neither my husband or mother-in-law was convinced. But speaking generally, there is no such thing as an ideal family. It may be hard for a while... So you want me to endure? If you can. But if you insist on divorcing, we'll speak to your husband. but it'll be difficult. I agree. You must be prepared. It will be difficult. It's going to take a long time... Yes. I don't care how long it takes. But for him to sue Haruki... He'll be worried and humiliated. Aunt? Why did I go to Hokkaido? I wish I hadn't gone. What's done is done. You can cry, Machiko. If you're sad, cry all you want. You're just like the tree over there. But when spring comes, that tree will grow new leaves, flowers will bloom. Understand? So be strong. Some people like having Sado in the middle of Tokyo and that's why they come. But it was my dream to have my own restaurant. It's small but it's mine, so you can stay as long as you need to win the trial. Thank you so much. Ma'am? A customer wants to talk to you. Isn't that funny? Ma'am without a husband? You both must be tired. Don't wait for me. Go to bed. Just the thought of a trial gives me a headache. According to the plaintiff, Katsunori Hamaguchi, the defendant, Haruki Atomiya, compelled the plaintiff's wife, Machiko Hamaguchi, to go to Hokkaido, had an adulterous relationship, and defamed the plaintiff. How do you plead, Defendant? I declare that what is in the complaint is groundless. I will now ask the plaintiff. While your wife was still living with you how far did the relationship with the defendant go? I don't know the details. But even after we were married, the defendant was secretly sending letters. That's a lie. There's no truth to... Defendant, keep quiet. The plaintiff is making his statement. When I became his superior in the PR department, the defendant and Machiko met at the kabuki theater. Mr. Hamaguchi, you got it all wrong. You keep quiet. The conversation between them, according to Machiko, was that they would never meet again. That means they were indeed meeting. Further proof is that the defendant summoned Machiko to his lodgings and met with her alone in his room. Mr. Hamaguchi, that's because you forced me to resign. The defendant should keep quiet. But I have to say this. Machiko came to apologize to me because I lost my job because of her. The plaintiff is making a statement. - Keep quiet - No, I won't. I can't remain silent. Do you know why you're being sued? Have you no shame? You're the one who should be ashamed. What? I could prove my innocence if this was about me. But when it concerns Machiko... How dare you refer to his wife in such a manner! Shameless! Judge. As you can see, he is unrepentant. He is brazen. He is vile. Stop this! Please don't torture Mr. Atomiya. Please stop... Please... Stop. Stop! Please stop. Machiko. Machiko. What's the matter? A bad dream? Aunt. - May I help you? - I'm Hamaguchi. I'm here to see Mr. Nagahashi. This way. It's been a while. Thank you for trying to help before. I'm sorry I couldn't be of any help. I've been transferred to the Kumamoto office. So I haven't done anything, but I hear things have escalated. Please sit down. I saw Hamaguchi at the office yesterday. I suppose his jealousy is driving him to revenge. But this eye for an eye attitude will only hurt the both of you. It won't do Hamaguchi any good either. So, I took it upon myself to mediate and spoke to Hamaguchi. Will you put yourself in my hands? I want you to come to Kyushu with me. You can stay at my house. Or you can work. Will you put yourself under my supervision and not see Mr. Atomiya for a while? Hamaguchi says he will withdraw his suit then. And he'll more rationally consider the future. Perhaps this is not a satisfactory arrangement. But Hamaguchi is being obstinate. I urge you to do so and wait for the right time. Perhaps Hamaguchi will change. Fighting it out in court not lead to a solution very easily. Well, Machiko? How about it? Or do you want to keep fighting in court? I hear you're with your aunt. Why don't you discuss it with her? Mr. Atomiya. Machiko went to Kyushu, without waiting for you to come back. She promised not to see you for some time in exchange for Hamaguchi withdrawing the suit. Machiko couldn't bear the thought of yon being dragged into court because of her. In any case, come back to Tokyo soon. Everyone's waiting. I asked you to come here to console you. But Hokkaido just caused you more heartache. I'm really sorry. No, it was me that caused you all the trouble. No problem. Be well. And come back to Hokkaido with Machiko someday. I'll be praying for that day. Hokkaido just caused you more heartache. Kyushu Unzen Mr. Nagahashi is waiting in the lobby. Thank you. Hello. Mr. Nagahashi wants to talk to you. Please make yourself at home. - How's it going? - I'm fine, thank you. We need to talk. Shall we take a walk? I'll speak to the manager. I received a letter from Hamaguchi yesterday. He said he will give you a divorce. However, there's a huge condition. He'll agree to it only if you marry any other man but Haruki Atomiya. Surprised? It looks like Hamaguchi is not rational concerning you. He wasn't like that before. He was earnest... perhaps too earnest. So when he went off the deep end, he couldn't come up again. This is a conundrum. What will you do? There's nothing I can do. Mrs. Hamaguchi. You're the guest in room 201. Don't refer to me like that. - My name is Soejima. - I'm sorry. I'm kidding. Isn't that man you were talking to the lieutenant governor Mr. Nagahashi? You know him? I've met him on business a couple of times. What were you two talking about? It looked serious. Am I right? I sense you are very unhappy. Oh, sorry. I've been thinking that for some time. And I've felt for you. I'll go say hello to Mr. Nagahashi. Oh, Mrs. Hamaguchi? I'd like to get to know you. - Hiya! - Are you leaving, Editor? - What brings you here? - I was passing by. Is Mr. Atomiya here? He has a guest. How's business? Good, thanks. Please keep us in mind. Thanks. Atomiya will be jealous. Don't joke. Mr. Atomiya and I... - You're not involved? - No. Then I'll be by to seduce you. - You don't mind? - Not at all. I'll be waiting. And when I do, you'll give me the cold shoulder. Oops, I almost forgot. A present for my wife. - May I sit down? - Please. Katsunori Hamaguchi It may be unacceptable to you, but it's the best I can do. So think about it and give me an answer. Good-bye. Thanks for waiting. I thought divorce was simple these days. But there are extenuating circumstances. I see. I hear your former wife was beautiful. I'm apprehensive. What's happened? A mixed-race child was run over. What a bother. I see. He said the same thing to Machiko. He's no gentleman. Maybe you should just marry me. But that's not on. Want to talk at my place? Yes? I'm Atomiya. Oh, Asa. What? Toshiki? What? The driver just left. He didn't care because the boy is mixed-race. He said he'll send money later, like Toshiki wasn't human. I see. I feel so sorry for Kozue. Mr. Kaseda. How is he? They just finished operating. Kozue. This is awful. Be strong. Doctor? Will he live? If he gets through tonight. We'll do all we can. Thank you. Doctor? Please. I don't care if he becomes disabled. Please safe his life. Doctor, please. Please be quiet. Why are we so unfortunate? We're all good people. Mr. Atomiya? You can see Sukiya Bridge from here. I wonder how Machiko's doing. Aya. I may be going to Europe soon. What? The magazine wants to send me as a reporter. You're going to leave Machiko like this? When the wind blows... When the wind blows memories may change... Colored by the neon... Some may cry but Sukiya Bridge never changes. Isn't this awesome? This is Mt Unzen's silver frost. The fog on the bare trees freezes during the night. Look, an ice forest, and ice woods. Ice branches... It's like a dream. Why is nature so beautiful? But, Mrs. Hamaguchi, the reason humans see nature as beautiful is because they are unhappy. Aren't you in the throes of unhappiness? Mrs. Hamaguchi, the reason I came to Unzen is to ask you to marry me. Mr. Nagahashi has told me all about you. That you're having a difficult time, with your divorce and about this man Atomiya. Machiko. Your husband Hamaguchi says that if you marry anyone but Atomiya he will agree to divorce you. That set me thinking. I have to make you happy. That's what I thought. That's because from the first time I saw you, I knew you were the woman I was looking for. Machiko. Will you marry me? Of course, it can be on paper in the beginning, to make Hamaguchi agree to a divorce. You can do whatever you like after that. You can go marry Atomiya or enter into a real marriage with me. Well? Does that interest you? The ice branches... Then that's your final answer? Yes. I see. That's a problem. What am I supposed to do? I often think about this. It all began because I was sympathetic to you and Machiko's plight. I took Machiko to look for you from Sado to Tokyo and even to Toba. But we couldn't find you. And because of that, Machiko married me. But I didn't force her. It was Machiko who suggested it, on the beach at Wagu. I was elated, so happy. I couldn't believe it. But you have to believe your good fortune. I told myself many times that Machiko was mine. And after a year, I was confident of my happiness. Then... YOU appeared. That was when I was transferred to Tokyo. What should I have done? You and Machiko may think I'm a despicable man. But you two don't know how I've suffered. You don't know how I suffer from my love for Machiko. I was so miserable caught between you and Machiko and Machiko and Mother. Mr. Atomiya. If you and Machiko get together, it would be a slap in my face and my suffering. Don't you think so? Sometimes humiliation is worse than death for a man. Mr. Hamaguchi. It's not that I don't understand how you feel. It was fate. But wasn't it you, your doing that drove us to where we are today? I tried to forget Machiko numerous times. I have never forgotten that Machiko was your wife. I've always honored that relationship. You have to believe that. But it's different now. I believe that marrying Machiko is an obligation to myself and Machiko. I don't care what you think. But Machiko is still my wife. Legally and also emotionally for me. Atomiya. If I never divorce Machiko, what will you do? It can't be helped. I'll wait forever until you relent. Read this. It's from a man named Soejima from Kyushu. He says he wants to marry Machiko. What do you think of the letter? I'm not saying I believe the letter. Do you know this man Soejima? No. Are you telling the truth? Why would I lie? I see. I thought you and Machiko were in on that letter. But now that I've spoken to you, I know that's not true. Atomiya. We both love Machiko too much. Katsunori. Yoshiko is here. Come in. You have a guest. No, it's all right. I have to go back to the office. There's not much time until I depart. So I'll say good-bye. Sorry to have bothered you. - It's a great house. - Not at all. It must seem like a closet compared to yours. Katsunori and I discussed this. If by any chance you marry Katsunori, we'll have to build an addition to the house. That's all right. This will suit us just fine. Since there'll only be two of us. It'll be more convenient. If I do marry, we'll have to build a house for you, somewhere quiet. No, I'm fine here. You're staying? I've lived here a long time. I will stay here. That's not right. Then we should build somewhere else. Where should that be? It can be small but very modem. I'd like a western style house. What about you? Don't you like modem? No, I... Yoshiko... if you marry, you'd prefer to live just with your husband? Of course. Oh, is that wrong? I thought if we got married, we wouldn't be living with you. Because if we have to be mindful of each other then we can't really enjoy life. Is that what the young people think these days? I don't know. But that's my first condition for marriage. You really speak your mind. Am I really in the way? I've considered Katsunori my reason for living. To live apart from Katsunori... Don't you agree, Katsunori? If that happens, I... Mother. It's no use saying that now. Yoshiko, why don't we go out. Ginza? Excuse me. Are all young people like that? I didn't know she was like that. Even though she's the undersecretary's daughter, she's not suitable. If you marry her, what will happen to me? In this light, Machiko would have been better. Machiko never talked to me like that. Mother You say that now? If you feel that way, why didn't you say so when Machiko was here? It's too late now. Mother. I'm not going to sacrifice myself for you again. Are you going now? - Thank you. - Come again. When you've cleaned up, you may go to bed. It's too late now. Mother, in the past I have done my best to make this family a happy one. I've worried and made great efforts to find ways to please you both. But you take everything I do the wrong way. You followed me today in secret. You don't trust me. If you want me to trust you, why don't you become a wife I can trust? Dear? What do you want me to do? How can I satisfy you? Please, tell me. Don't be impertinent. Why don't you ask yourself that? When I say apologize, do as I say. Mother has done everything for me. Unlike you, I'm her only concern. If he had died then, I was going to die, too. That means you saved two lives, Doctor. But I was afraid of you. You ordered me to keep quiet. Oh, that! But your prayers got through to him. Right, Kid. When you're all better, I'll take you to the zoo. - Really? - How nice. I wish I'd been run over by a car, too. - I'll be going then. - Thank you for coming. - Take care. - Thank you. He is a great doctor. Oh, Sister Aya. Good morning. Was that Doctor Nojima? I'm so glad you're better. Where are you going so early? Atomiya left for Kyushu so I saw him off. Kyushu? Arriving tomorrow morning. Need to see you. Atomiya. Mrs. Hamaguchi. The guest in 110 wants to see you. Oh? Who is it? She just arrived. She got ill and we called a doctor. Room 110? Come in. She was asking for you. The trip was too much and she developed pneumonia. Her fever's high. Machiko. Is that you, Machiko? Mother. Machiko. Where's Katsunori? Please call him. Please call his office. Mother. You're in Kyushu. You're in Unzen. Oh, yes. I remember. Machiko. I... I came to see you. Katsunori is... Did you sleep? Her breathing is easier. - Her fever's down, too. - That's good. Why don't you get some rest? Thank you. Yes? Mrs. Hamaguchi. Mr. Atomiya is outside. I'll be right back. Machiko. It's been a long time. I have to go back immediately. Can you come out for a few minutes? Yes. I'll tell them. Mother Hamaguchi is here. Why? I don't know. I'll ask someone to cover for me. Before I left, I had to see you again. I wanted to see you, too. Since we're so far apart, I think of you all the time. And it makes me so sad sometimes and I get a fever. These days, I feel so forlorn. When Aya told me you were leaving I wanted to go with you to escape from the pain I was feeling. I really considered it. But that's only wishful thinking. Machiko. If it was possible, I want that, too. But like you, it's just a wish. I met Hamaguchi the other day. We had a long talk for the first time and I promised him that I will wait until he had a change of heart. He's not entirely a bad person. He can't escape from the pain of loving you. We're not the only ones suffering. Look, Machiko. For us to be together properly, there's no other way for me but to wait years with you in my heart. Even if I die before that happens, I'm all right with that. Haruki, because of me, you've made such a sad decision. I am so blessed as long as you have me in your heart. But that you should suffer for a long time because of me... Machiko. If we hadn't met perhaps we could have been happy. But love is not about whether you're happy now. It transcends that. No matter how unhappy I am, I will never stop loving you. Haruki! Machiko. I don't know when we'll see each other again. So can you come to Shimabara to see me off? Yes. I have to be back in Tokyo by tomorrow. I leave the day after tomorrow. Haruki. Be safe and come home as soon as you can. You take care, too. That must be Amakusa. "My beloved." "Is so far away..." "I call her name" "and call..." "But she does not answer..." "The sadness of echoes..." "We met and we parted" "the sadness of love" "the sadness, the happiness" "and the pain..." "I shout them out..." "But she does not answer..." "The misery of echoes..." Thank you. How is she? She's sleeping. Oh, Machiko. When did you get back? I hear you had a visitor. Yes. I'm sorry I left you alone. Mr. Atomiya came from Tokyo. Atomiya? He's been transferred to work abroad. Is he here now? No, he left. He didn't stay? No. I see. Machiko. I hear you took care of me during the night. Why are you so kind to me? I did awful things to you. - Why? - Mother. That's in the past. Please rest and get better. Thank you. Machiko. I... I came to Unzen to see you and apologize. I really should kneel and beg forgiveness. But since I'm ill in bed... Mother. That's not... I'm sorry for everything. I felt... I was losing Katsunori to you. I was so sad and did those things to you. I really feel sorry. Forgive me. Mother, it's not necessary. No. You tried so hard to make everyone happy. I forced you to leave. I wanted to split you and Katsunori up. I told Katsunori and he was angry at me. I really am sorry. Machiko. If at all possible, I want you to come back to us. I came here to get you. Please come back. Please come back to the Hamaguchi family with me. And this time, let's make it a happy family. You must think I'm thinking only of myself. I'm willing to change my ways. Please. Come back. Or else, Katsunori will marry someone else. I'll tell you everything. She's an undersecretary's daughter. But I don't like her. If she comes, what will happen to me? She'll force me out. Please. You'll be helping me. Take pity on me and come back. Please, Machiko. If only you'd come back... Katsunori doesn't care about her. Even now, he has no intention of divorcing you. For Katsunori's sake, no, for mine, please come back. Please, Machiko. It embarrasses me to say this now, but I can't help it. Please, Machiko, forgive me and come back. - Please. - Mother. Mother, I don't know what to say. But forgive me. I... I can't go back. Machiko. Why not? Are you in love with Mr. Atomiya? Yes. I can't help how I feel. But you were married to Katsunori feeling the way you feel. But I don't ever want to make that mistake again. Because of that, everyone became unhappy. I'm really sorry for what I've done. I see. I see. I was a fool. I did something irreparable. Mother... Mother... Please don't cry. If you do, I don't know what to do. Machiko. It's all right. I won't ask you anymore. I was being selfish. I made you suffer just by asking. I'm happy just for your kindness. I'm glad I came. Because I got to talk to you. Mother. Why I couldn't come around to how I feel now... That's my only regret. Mother. Please rest quietly. Or you'll get sick again. Please, Mother? I'm sorry. You must be tired, too. Go and rest tonight. Manager! I hear your mother went to Kyushu? She went to see your ex-wife? I wonder why she went? It looks like she really hated what I said to her. Then your ex-wife should come back. You want that, too, don't you? No. I... You can tell me. You were going to marry me out of despair and to get back at your wife. And because I'm the undersecretary's daughter. Marrying me will help your career. Despite your ulterior motive, I feel attracted to you. It might be fun to battle your memories of your wife. At least I won't be bored. I don't feel love is necessary for marriage. Let's dance. I love this kind of life. Let's dance. Come on. Yoshiko. I don't mean to be rude, but I don't think it'll work. Welcome home. - Mother's back? - Yes, a while ago. Mother. Katsunori, I'm sorry for leaving without telling you. I went to see Machiko. I hoped she would come back to us, but I couldn't persuade her. I'm sorry. She is a kind good woman. When I got sick there, she took care of me. How was Machiko? She looked worn out. I pity her. Mother. I'll live with you for the foreseeable future. I told Yoshiko we won't get married. Oh, Katsunori. But why? Was it because of me? You don't have to think about me. I'll move out, or do whatever you want and be a good mother. No, it's not because of you. It's for my own personal reasons. I just want to lead a peaceful life. Until Machiko's memory fades from this house. It was raining just like tonight, when Machiko left the first time. Machiko. Machiko. Machiko. Machiko. Machiko. She was never robust, but taking care of a sick person must have taken its toll. And she's now at Mr. Nagahashi's? She's recuperating at Aso Kogen Hotel through Mr. Nagahashi's introduction. I see. She's in Aso. Machiko. I heard you were ill. Why didn't you contact me? I thought you were running away from me. I'm sorry. I saw Mr. Hamaguchi in Tokyo. I want to talk to you about it. Let's find a coffee shop. Poor Hamaguchi. He got caught in his own trap. I thought he would be more formidable, so he was unexpectedly easy. Come to Tokyo with me, and we'll see Hamaguchi together. He said he'll grant you a divorce. Machiko. You'll finally be free. What's the matter? I thought you'd be overjoyed. Won't you thank me? I appreciate your kindness. But I don't want a divorce on false pretenses. Why not? Everything is negotiable. Why aren't you more proactive for your happiness? I'm doing all I can in my own way. But I don't want to go so far as to trick Katsunori. However, isn't he ignoring your civil rights by saying he won't divorce you unless you marry anyone but Atomiya? So my strategy is the correct one. There's nothing to be ashamed of. And I'm not lying or tricking him in the least. That's because I've asked you to marry me. If you marry me, then we're not tricking Hamaguchi. Well? That's what I think. Is that wrong, Machiko? Mr. Soejima. Please let's not discuss this anymore. I know you're being kind, but please don't bother about me anymore. I vowed I'd never do anything I regret again. Perhaps, I'm going to die... I have a feeling... Don't say that, Machiko. I feel so forlorn. So no matter what Katsunori does, since he was once my husband, I can't bring myself to deceive him. I think Mr. Atomiya would say the same. If I'm to die, I want to die with a pure heart. Even if I live... So, Mr. Soejima, I ask you to leave me alone. You may think I'm foolish, but this is how I've conducted myself. And I will go on doing so. I see. You are a beautiful person. You're beyond my reach. I'm sorry I butted in. I'll give you up here and now. I won't show my face again. Machiko? This Atomiya. He's probably thinking about you in Europe. Machiko, take care of yourself. No matter how distant this sky is, it is connected to the sky in Europe. Bye. ...enduring her sadness, the Aso Volcano hides red hot flames within. Sitting beneath the eternal blue skies, Mt. Aso, with a limitless reservoir of fire, surrounded by an outer crater rim of 82 miles, this large plain exists in a large depression created by an eruption a long time ago. The Aso Mountain, filled with sadness, conceals red hot flames within... Kozue looks like she's having fun. Sister Aya, Kozue's had a hard life because of Toshi, but now she may find happiness because of Toshi. The other day I heard Dr. Nojima talking to Uncle Kaseda. Just like I mended Toshi's wounds, he said, if I could, I want to heal Kozue's emotional wounds. Did he? Dr. Nojima is very manly. I'd be glad if that happened. - Sister Yukie - Yukie! I'm sorry we're late. Isn't Mr. Nishina with you? He said he's had enough of babysitting. So he stayed home. Is he starling to be a demanding husband? Now that Kayoko has a mother, Mr. Nishina isn't worried anymore. Kayoko, want to get on that ride? Thank you. Sit down. How is Machiko? It sound pretty bad. And she can't stay in Kyushu forever. She wants to go back to Sado. But that Uncle is so unreasonable. So I'm thinking of getting her into a Tokyo hospital and asked Dr. Nojima for advice. I see. I'd like to take care of her... in Haruki's place. Auntie? I have to look in on my restaurant. Asa, you'll help? Thank you, Aya, for being here every day. Since Yukie's here, too. You get some rest. Thank you. What do you think, Aya... Will Machiko be all right? She wasn't strong physically and emotionally even when she was little. And these several years have taken their toll. Poor girl. How do you feel? Please get better soon. Whenever I hear about you, I feel so remorseful. I've wanted to apologize to you. I'm the real reason you're so unhappy. That's not so. The dark shadow I cast has fallen on you. At that time, I had been betrayed by the one I trusted and I couldn't trust even my brother, Haruki. Machiko. Please get well soon and wait for Haruki to return. I need you two to be happy. I wonder how Haruki is? He's probably worried about you. I let him know. Thank you. Excuse me. Machiko. Katsunori called. He said he wants to come see you tonight. He says he must see you. Shall I refuse? - No... - You'll see him? I was shocked to hear from Mr. Nagahashi that you were very ill. I know I don't have the right to visit you. Machiko. I brought this today. This is the divorce papers you were waiting for. I've signed it. I'm sorry I made you suffer for a long time. I learned two days ago from Soejima's letter that you refused to trick me into getting a divorce. I was really happy. Machiko. Please forgive me for what I've done. That's not necessary. I was the one who did inexcusable things. But it couldn't be helped. It was no one's fault. No one could help it. I couldn't control my feelings when it came to you. I didn't want to let you go, no matter what. I'm really amazed that recently I've become so rational about you. Perhaps it was the time. Or it was the purity of you and Atomiya's love. In any case, I'm sorry. I've been able to go back to the same feeling I had when I took you to look for Atomiya. If I love you, I should wish for your happiness. We've gone back to square one. We took a very hard and torturous detour, but please blame human folly. Dear? When you say that, I don't know what to do. But I'm really glad. That the day has come and you truly forgive me. I can die anytime now without regrets. Don't say that, Machiko. Be strong. Your life has just begun. Get well soon and wait for Atomiya to return. Yes. I will. I hear you took good care of Mother. She was very happy. How is she? She's fine and asked me to send her regards. Mother. She's become so kind. We're all good people. Why did that have to happen? Why? I wonder why. I'll give this to your aunt. Machiko what's the matter? Aunt. I'm sorry this is so late, but it's the divorce papers. Divorce papers! - Machiko. - Aunt. Katsunori. Why didn't you come sooner? You made her ill with all the suffering. Please don't blame Katsunori. Dear? Please find a good wife. And please find happiness. Please? Perhaps we may never meet again, Machiko. Please get well soon. I'll be going then. Aunt. It's time. Machiko. Machiko. Machiko. It took such a long time. But once you get well, all that's left is to wait for Atomiya to return. You'll be happy very soon. So be strong, Machiko. But, Aunt, do you really think I'll find happiness? What are you saying? Isn't that why you've suffered for so long? But maybe that day will never come. - I may just... - Machiko. You're so pessimistic. That's why unhappiness follows you. So, be strong. Be strong of will. If you're discouraged you can't get better. You hear, Machiko? I want to see Haruki one more time. It's only been three months since he went away. I wonder when he'll return. Aunt? Open the curtain. I want to see the city. I've been in bed ever since I came back to Tokyo. Please, Aunt. Open the curtain. The lights are beautiful. Can you see Sukiya Bridge? Yes, I can. What? You called me for that? I'm sorry. Editor, can't you do something? I want them to see each other one more time. But Atomiya's not just there for us, he's a special reporter for the newspaper. It won't be simple. And he'll have to use his own money to get here. I know that. Even if I have to sell this shop, I'll... Hey. That's magnanimous. Please, get him home. If something happens to Machiko, it would be too sad. But why are you so concerned about Atomiya and this girl? It's curious. I bet it's you who wants to see Atomiya. Editor. Yes, I love Atomiya, too. But the love they have for each other is special. I can never be like that. Perhaps I'm asking them to do what I can't. It's sad when I think about it, but I'm fine with it. I see. Atomiya is a lucky man to have a woman like you that much in love with him. When you called, I thought you were going to say yes to me so I even shaved. You're joking. The folks in Sado sent this, so please take it home to your wife. Oh, thank you. You're a good woman. If I wasn't married, I'd be in love with you. Thank you. I'll do what I can about Atomiya. - Please. - Oh, well. I'll walk you out. I want to give her the good news. Machiko! Aya. What's wrong, Auntie? Machiko's missing. Machiko? Machiko. Haruki. Machiko. Machiko, what are you doing? You shouldn't be out here. Aya, I'm sorry! I wanted to come here once again before I died. Machiko, Machiko. Machiko. Well? Dr. Nojima, is she dying? It's hard to say. But it's all about her will to live. How much she wants to get well... I'll ask the hospital director to take special care. Thank you. Why did Atomiya have to go so far away? Aunt. Haruki is waiting at Sukiya Bridge. I have to go. Machiko, try to be strong. Haruki. I'm getting married tomorrow. After we parted, I couldn't see you on either the six-month or one-year anniversary. And now that I'm finally able to see you, it's good-bye. Haruki, I didn't intend to see you again. But before I got married, I wanted to see this bridge full of memories one more time. And if... if you were here, I wanted to get a glimpse of you. Thank you. I'm glad you came. I hope you'll be very happy. Haruki, perhaps you're already married? Good-bye then. Haruki. Machiko. A phone call for you. Hello? Oh, Editor? Is that true? So he left yesterday. I see. Yes. Yes. Thank you. - Atomiya's coming home. - He is? Machiko? Machiko. Atomiya's coming home. Machiko. Atomiya's coming. Machiko. Haruki. Machiko. Be strong. Atomiya will be here tonight. Machiko. Machiko. Machiko. - Atomiya. - Aya. - Welcome home. - How's Machiko? She's okay. Go see her. Please go to her. Atomiya. Please praise her. Machiko won her fight. Machiko. Let's leave them alone. Haruki. Machiko. Welcome home. Machiko. Forgive me. I didn't know you were so ill. I'm sorry I'm like this when you came such a long way. But I'm glad you're alive. If you had died, what was I supposed to do? Haruki, I won't die. I'll be with you always. Machiko. This time I'll never let you go. What was all that suffering about? Machiko, rest in my arms. And get healthy again so we can built a happy life together. I can't believe we're here together. It seems like a dream. I'm so happy. Look the dawn is breaking. Don't worry and go to sleep. Haruki. Oblivion is to completely forget...
