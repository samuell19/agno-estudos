Back then, I found a number that helped this woman win a big lottery jackpot. She bet down 50 USD and she won 2,500 USD. She even gave me a 25 USD tip. That was the biggest amount I have ever had. That was when everybody trusted me and they let me stay up here From then on, I keep seeing lucky numbers. They haunt me everywhere, even in my dreams. It's been a while now, that I haven't found my numbers Now no one believes me anymore. But I still believe in myself. When I was little, I heard that whoever plays the number makes a lot of money. But it is a form of gambling. Anyone that plays them, the police arrests them Anyone that plays them, the police arrests them But laborers, they are not afraid. They even play the numbers everyday. They want to change their lives. In my experience, the day someone plays numbers, they encounter strange things in life. Believing in spirituality to find their lucky numbers. When they find the numbers, they bet big amounts. Either by borrowing money or putting down their house to play too. They write down the numbers they want and give them to the bookie. But these people are just one of many other bookies. That are working for a big boss to make their juice money. All bookies, gamblers, and big bosses do not know each other. And this secret and complicated system is all hidden but they are linked by runners like us. And this is how we make money. And the lottery recorder gives directly to the debt collectors the loan papers, but I heard rumors that these creditors are also the lottery dealers themselves, but they will not admit it.
