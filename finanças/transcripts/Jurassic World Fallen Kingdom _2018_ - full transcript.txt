(ROARING) (RUMBLING) NEWS ANCHOR: Three years after the fall of Jurassic World, the debate over Isla Nublar rages on. The island's long-dormant volcano, reclassified as active, has shown considerable unrest in recent months. Geologists now predict an extinction-level event will kill off the last living dinosaurs on the planet. Since the disaster that shocked the world in 2015, the Masrani Corporation has paid out more than 800 million in damages to settle class-action lawsuits brought by survivors. Activist groups have mobilized around the globe in what has become the flashpoint animal rights issue of our time. With an eruption expected at any moment, the US Senate has convened a special committee to answer a grave, moral question. Do dinosaurs deserve the same protections given to other endangered species or should they be left to die? MALCOLM: I think that we should allow our magnificent and glorious dinosaurs to be taken out by the volcano. (ALL MURMURING) MAN: Murderer. SHERWOOD: Silence, please. As deeply sad as that would be, we altered the course of natural history. This is a correction. Are you suggesting the Almighty is taking matters in his own hands? Senator, with all due respect, God's not part of the equation, no. What I mean is that, in the last century, we amassed landmark technological power and we've consistently proven ourselves incapable of handling that power. Eighty years ago, who could've predicted nuclear proliferation? But then there it was. And now we've got genetic power, so how long is it gonna take for that to spread around the globe and what's gonna be done with it? It ain't gonna stop with the de-extinction of the dinosaurs. I'm not sure I know what you're talking about. (SIGHS) I'm talking about man-made, cataclysmic change. What kind of change? Change is like death. You don't know what it looks like until you're standing at the gates. (ELEVATOR CLANGING) (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) WOMAN: Yes, absolutely! MAN: We would love to have a photo op with the senator. As a matter of fact, I do have the dinosaurs' best interests in mind. I'm a paleo-veterinarian. DELGADO: (ON PHONE) Is that a real thing? That's a real thing. No, I haven't seen one with my own eyes. You know, not everyone can afford to spend their life savings... (WHISPERS) Claire! Oh, uh... Hello. Hello, um... (WHISPERS) Congresswoman Delgado. Congresswoman Delgado. I'm Claire. I'm the lead organizer here. Of course, but if I could just get a moment of your time? Great. Thank you. Um... So, our mission here at the Dinosaur Protection Group is to secure federal funding for a safe, natural... That was, like, 40 seconds. You're getting better. You gotta stop letting your mom shop for you. You don't need to insult rne every time someone pisses you off. Dude, I'm a doctor, not a telemarketer. What is your job again? You plug in cords, right? It's actually more important than it sounds. Can I ask you a question? DELGADO: Go on. Do you have kids? Two girls. Okay. So, your kids, an entire generation, has grown up in a world where dinosaurs are living and breathing. Butsoon, they're gonna have to watch them go extinct. Or not. If people like you make a difference. Set up a meeting with my office after the hearing. (SIGHS) Great. ZIAI Yes! NEWS ANCHOR: We now go live to the Capitol... Claire, it's on. MAN: Turn it up. NEWS ANCHOR: ...the US government will take preventative action to protect the dinosaurs on Isla Nublar. After thorough deliberations, the committee has resolved not to recommend any legislative action regarding the de-extinct creatures on Isla Nublar. This is an act of God. And while, of course, we feel great sympathy for these animals, we cannot condone government involvement on what amounts to a privately-owned venture. (TV TURNS OFF) They're all gonna die and no one cares. FRANKLIN: We do. (CELL PHONE RINGING) (SIGHS) Give me one second. Let's get back to work. Okay, everyone, come on. Hello? (SIGHS) WOMAN: (ON PHONE) May I speak with Ms. Dearing? Yes, this is Claire Dearing. Good morning, I'm calling from Mr. Benjamin Lockwood's estate. Would you mind holding for a second? Yes, of course I'll hold. (DOORBELL RINGS) Ms. Dearing, you're early. Would you like to step in? Thank you. I will inform Mr. Mills that you've arrived. MILLS: John Alfred Hammond, the father of Jurassic Park. But of course you knew that. Hello, Claire. I'm Eli Mills. I work for Ben Lockwood. We actually met once, seven, eight years ago, and you don't remember. Of course I remember. Haven't you run his foundation since... Since college, yeah. You remember? Yes. Wow. Cool. (CHUCKLES) He wanted someone young andideahsfic to spend his fortune and I used to be both. (BOTHLAUGH) Follow me. Let me give you a bit of history. This is where it all began. Before the island, Sorna, Jurassic Park, all of it. Hammond and Lockwood built a custom lab in the sub-basement, extracted the first DNA from amber right beneath our feet. Oh, my goodness. What they did here was a miracle. I still believe that. So do I, Claire. So do I. And I still believe it matters what happens to those animals. There is something Mr. Lockwood would very much like you to do, Claire. You can call it a favor for an old friend. We have a piece of land. A sanctuary protected by natural barriers, fully self-sustaining. A new home where the dinosaurs will be secure and free. CLAIRE: You're gonna get them out? You're gonna save them? BENJAMIN: No, Ms. Dearing. I'm going to save us. We could both use a touch of redemption, couldn't we? Lovely to see you again. And you, Mr. Lockwood. BENJAMIN: This was all John Hammond's dream. To let these creatures live in peace. So, we have created sanctuary. No fences. No cages. No tourists. Justas Mother Nature intended. John said it best. "These creatures don't need our protection. "They need our absence." When we were young, we both shared this passion, John and I. What fools we were, trying to run before we'd learned to walk. As all young men do, I suppose. But we learned. Unfortunately, in the end, it drove us apart. Life teaches us some very hard lessons, doesn't it, Claire? Yes. Hmm? Sir Benjamin. Ah. My bloody medicines. Will you excuse me, Claire? Of course. BENJAMIN: Eli here will help you with the details. We will save them. What a gift for our children. Thank you. Iris? (COUGHING) Does he have children? I thought I saw... Was there a little girl? He has a grandchild. His daughter died in a car accident. That's awful. Yeah, I know, but they're very close. Really close. So, what do you need from me? MILLS: There was a tracking system in place at your park. Radio-frequency ID chips in each dinosaur. I remember. Right. MILLS: So, if we could access that system, our ability to locate and capture those animals safely would increase tenfold. We need your handprint to access the system, but what I really need, Claire, is you. Moving endangered species isn't exactly legal, but it's the right thing to do. No one knows this park as well as you do and we need that expertise. How many can you save? Eleven species. For sure. I mean, more if we can, but time is against us. I'm afraid there is one animal in particular that poses a real challenge for us. Blue. I didn't know she had a name, but Blue is potentially the second-most intelligent piece of life on this planet and she's the last of her kind. She must be preserved. She can pick up your scent a mile off. You'll never capture her. Well, we thought you might know someone who could help. Maybe you could convince him. (EXHALES) (HAMMERING) OWEN: (SINGING) Oh, Time, she is a freight train chugging Oh, stalling Time is, too When the light at the end of the tunnel Is growing small behind you Hey, Owen. I still love you in the morning Owen! Oh, boy. Hi. Back for more, huh? Can I buy you a beer? Did you bring them, or do we gotta, like, go somewhere? (MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS) (CLAIRE LAUGHING) I'm sorry. Seriously? I can't believe you think that you left me! Replay the conversation in your head, all right? You said, "You wanna go live in your van, like a burn? "Go ahead, Owen." And I said, "Okay." So, how is that you leaving me? Because I left. I left you. You left because I told you to. And then, I left. Because you didn't wanna live in a van on the side of the road. No. No, no, no. Remember? Because you wouldn't let me drive the damn van for five minutes. I'm chivalrous. What can I do? You are so stubborn. Well, look at you now. You're saving the world. I'm trying, at least. You can't just run away from everything, Owen. So, you're what... Dating an accountant now? An insurance actuary? Your skin looks nice. Dermatologist? Owen... Does he check you for moles? Stop. A ventriloquist? This is not why we're here, okay? Yeah, I know why we're here. Lockwood's little flunky called me. Rescue op. Save the dinosaurs from an island that's about to explode. What could go wrong? I'm going. Don't. I don't have a choice. What? Of course you have a choice. So, what, I should just build my own cabin, play pool, and drink beer all day while these dinosaurs go extinct? Yeah. I like pool. Blue is alive. Jesus, Claire! You raised her, Owen. You spent years of your life working with her. You're just gonna let her die? Well, yeah. Come on, you're a better man than you think you are. You should write fortune cookies. Forget it... There's a charter flight leaving tomorrow morning. You're on the manifest. I just wanted to let you know. (DOOR OPENS) (DINOSAURS SCREECHING) OWEN: (ON VIDEO) All right, chow time, chow time. Whoa, whoa. Back up. Back off. Hey, hey, hey. Jeez. Take it easy. Echo. Jeez, there's plenty of food.

You're more likely to die riding on a horse than in a plane. No, I'm not, because I won't get on a horse. My chances are zero. ZIA: Planes are the safest way to travel. FRANKLIN: You call this a plane? My cousin has a drone bigger than this. (FRANKLIN AND ZIA ARGUING INDISTINCTLY) (CLEARS THROAT) Owen! ZIA: Franklin, you Wiener, get on the plane. Didn't think you were gonna ever show up. Oh, um... This is Zia Rodriguez. Zia. Hey, how you doing? Yeah, real good. How are you? Good. Franklin Webb. Systems analyst. Nervous flyer? Would you ride a thousand-pound horse that's been abused all its life? I rode my motorcycle through the jungle with a paok of raptors. We're not compatible. (WHIRRING) IRIS: Maisie?

You know, one day, my heart might really stop. Then what would you do? Go and live in the forest with the lions? There are no lions in the forest. Your grandfather's been asking for you. Really? Mmm. So, you go see your grandfather, and then you go straight to your bath. I don't want a bath. What? Queen's English, girl. (IN BRITISH ACCENT) Bath. Bath. Bath. Bath.

I was on safari all the way through the Cretaceous to the Jurassic in one day. Oh, my. What'd you see? Mostly herbivores. There was one T. rex, though. Casualties, of course. Iris included. She jumped out of her skin. (CHUCKLING) You have your mother's wicked sense of humor. Do I look like her? Oh, yes. You could be her mirror image. Did my mother ever visit the park?

There's a large concentration on the east dock. That's our boat. We've already captured a bunch of them. Without the tracking system? The big herbivores are easy to find. Can you isolate that raptor? I need a species code. D-9. There she is. I'm gonna need to borrow your truck. I'm coming with you. We don't know what kind of condition she might be in. Miss, things could get hairy out there. These are powerful sedatives. One too many, and she could have respiratory failure. Also, I'm not as soft and witless as your comment implies. Let's go, beefcake. Oh, Owen? Be careful, okay? If I don't make it back, remember, you're the one who made me come. I'll be all right. (VEHICLES APPROACHING) (CHITTERING) (BEEPING) OWEN: We're not going to get any closer to her in this thing.

I don't really work with amateurs, so I'm gonna contact my buyers and call this off. They will be here tomorrow, and your buyers won't be disappointed. (CELL PHONE DIALING) Trust me, whatever their interest, agricultural, industrial, sport hunting, we will have something to suit them. Eleven species, each with unique biopharmaceutical properties.

I wanna talk to you about the future. I'll give you 10 minutes. The whole point of selling the lsla Nublar dinosaurs is to finance our future operations here. It's, uh, seed money. Call it an overture to something much more ambitious. EVERSOLL: Yeah, and more lucrative, I guess. MILLS: Right, we've reactivated the old facilities, updated the technology, and imported the best geneticists from around the world. This operation has been many years in the planning. Genetic power is an uncharted frontier. The potential for growth is more than you can fathom. This way, please. If the entire run of our sorry history hastaughtus one irrevocable lesson, it's that man is inevitably drawn to war and is willing to use any means necessary to win it. You're gonna weaponize them? We've been using animals in combat for centuries. Horses, elephants. The Soviets used disease-bearing rats against the Germans at Stalingrad. Yes, yes. Our geneticists have created a direct descendant of Henry Wu's masterpiece, the animal that took down Jurassic World. Indominus rex. Her DNA, retrieved from the island way before its destruction, forms the architecture of a completely new creature. Every bone and muscle designed for hunting and killing.

Gently. No,no,no. (GROWLING SOFTLY) (CHUCKUNG) Good job. You're making this look totally normal. (CHUCKLES) You're gonna have to jam it in there, it's really thick skin. Ready? Yeah. Okay. One, two... One, two... Stab! (SNARLS) Owen! (GROANS) It's working. (MEN LAUGHING) MAN 1: The pee is silent. MAN 2: That door is open. MAN 3: I got it. (GROWLING SOFTLY) (ROARING) CLAIRE: The bars!

(PANTING) (ROARING CONTINUES) (BOTH PANTING) Did you see that? Uh-huh. Please tell me you got the blood. (DOOR OPENS) (BEEPING) (WHIRRING) (HEART BEATING) (MACHINES BEEPING) (CHITTERING) OWEN: This is Delta. She's one of the holdover theropods, one of the survivors from the second group. Now, watch this. I show any sign of weakness whatsoever... (WHIMPERING) (SCREECHING) (GASPS) See that? Day 176. Blue is showing unprecedented levels of compliance. Here I am with Blue. She's a theropod from the new group. I show signs of weakness... (WHIMPERING) (PURRING) H9)'- I'm okay. (CHUCKLES) She's pretty extraordinary. (BLUE BREATHING RAPIDLY) (MACHINES BEEPING) OWEN: Blue, displaying levels of interest, concern, hyper-intelligence, cognitive bonding. See that? She's tilting her head, she's craning forward. Increased eye movement. She's curious. She's showing empathy. ZIA: Okay, I'm gonna make an incision in her leg to remove the bullet. (SCREECHING) It's a lot of muscle tissue. (BLUE GROANING) (SHUSHING) (CHITTERING) (LAUGHING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) She's gonna be okay. (sesame) (CHUCKUNG) OWEN: Blue is the key. (CHITTERING) That's it. You have Blue, you get these raptors to do anything. (DOOR OPENS) DR. WU: You're sure she'll live? If it dies, we have blood samples. DR. WU: No, no, no. That's not good enough. The raptor is a behavioral specimen. We need her in good health. I didn't shoot the damn thing. What do you want me to do, huh? You don't have the faintest comprehension of what I'm doing here. Do you understand the complexity of creating an entirely new life form? No, but I understand the complexity of paying for it, okay? All your money will have been wasted if I don't get Blue here in good health. To get the next iteration under control, it needs to form a familial bond with a closely related genefichnk. English, Henry. It needs a mother! Blue's DNA will be part of the next lndoraptor's makeup. So, it will be genetically coded to recognize her authority and assume her traits. Empathy. Obedience. Everything the prototype you have now is missing. Okay, so how long is this gonna take'? (SCOFFS) It's not a sprint, Mr. Mills. It's a marathon. A marathon sounds expensive. Besides, time is running out, and so is my patience, Henry. DR. WU: You have to understand, this is all uncharted territory. A wolf, genetically, is barely distinguishable from a bulldog, but within that gray area is art. MILLS: (GROANS) Spare me the poetry, Henry. Can you do it? Can you do it? DR. WU: Yes, I can do it. MILLS: Well, then do it. DR. WU: Thank you. MILLS: God, you're a pain in the ass. (ROARING) (SCREAMING) Hey. Hey! Maisie! (GROWLING) What is that? What is it? (GRUNTS) Keep her in there and keep the door locked. You want to keep her lockedin? That's exactly what I want. Sir Benjamin needs to see you now. I believe it's important.

You got a heartbeat? Yeah. Do you? I need blood samples. I'm not here to help you reset the food chain, so take your own damn samples. (EXHALES) What a nasty woman. Go, go, now, now. Go. MAN: (ON PA) Attention, all crew. Attention, all crew. Drivers, get to your vehicles. Hey! What the hell is going on? I was... I needed an extra pair of hands. He volunteered. Are you deck crew? Aye, aye. We're loading out. Follow me. Uh, does that mean we're leaving the ship right now? That is what "loading out" means. Now get moving. Come on, follow me. Come on, kid. There's lots to do. Shit! CLAIRE: Oh, no. He's not gonna make it. Get a move on. Come on. Move it! Come on. Move! CLAIRE: We have to help him. Stay here, I'll get him. (TRUCK ENGINE STARTS) There's no time. Let's go.

(RADIO BEEPS) MAN 1: Let's go! We want this offloaded in 1O mikes! MAN 2: Big door's open. (ROARING) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) (BLEATING) BENJAMIN: Did you really think you could get away with it? In my own house. You entrusted me to guide your fortune into the future. I have done that. Damn you! Pick up that phone. I want you to call the police. It'll be easier if the story comes from you. As you say, sir. You know, I've been thinking, John Hammond was right. (BEEP S) it was an unholy thing that you did. I'm not the only guilty one here, am I, sir? Hey. We hit that town, we call the cavalry, shut this down. Whoo. Hello. You should have stayed on the island. Better odds. (GUNS COCKING) (GASPS) MILLS: Hi, Claire. I just wanted to come and apologize. I didn't wanna bring you into any of this, but it was the only way that we could get the raptor. We needed it. Come on. (CLAIRE EXHALES HEAVILY) So, what? This is it? I mean, you're a smart guy, you could have started a foundation, cured cancer, but instead you, what? Sell endangered species? I saved these animals. You betrayed a dying man for money. Claire, I admire your idealism, but we both exploited these animals. At least I have the integrity to admit it. I never, ever did anything remotely illegal. You authorized the creation of the lndominus rex. You exploited a living thing in a cage for money. How is that different? Huh? And you, the man who proved raptors can follow orders. You never thought about the applications of your researoh, Owen? How many millions a trained predator might be worth? You two, you're the parents of the new world. (GROANS) Hey! Let him 9Q Owen. I think I'll break it. Let him go. (GROANING) Claire, I just want... (G ROANS) (CHUCKUNG) Say, how we gonna end this? Well, as far as everybody else is concerned, they burned up on the island. MAN 1: (ON RADIO) Buyers on approach. Looks like a full house. MAN 2: Roger that. EVERSOLL: Good evening. MILLS: Good evening. Welcome, gentlemen. EVERSOLL: Good evening. MILLS: Welcome. And these guys are development rep for Aldaris Pharmaceuticals. Great. The guy in the beard is a proxy for Gregor Adlrich, a Slovenian arms dealer. Equine buyers. Rand Magnus, an oil magnate from Houston. MILLS: What's their interest? EVERSOLL: Strictly personal. His kid wants a baby Triceratops. Glenn, how's Janet? GLENN: She's doing fine, thanks. EVERSOLL: (CHUCKLES) Straight ahead, Glenn. (CONVERSING IN RUSSIAN) (IN ENGLISH) Well, he only wants carnivores. Two of them. Looks like Lookwood's gonna have a very good night. Will he be joining us? MILLS: Um... That's very unlikely. (WHISPERS) Grandpa? Grandpa? Grandpa, wake up. Grandpa! (SOBBING) Grandpa, wake up. Wake up. (MONITOR FLATLINING) MILLS: Iris! Iris! (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) It's over. What a tragedy. I suppose now he's gone, you'll be looking for another situation. No. Maisie needs me. MILLS: I'm her guardian now. What she needs is no longer your concern. IRIS: You don't understand her the way I do. MILLS: I understand her value. But I raised her. I raised both of them. Please, Mr. Mills. MILLS: Goodbye, Iris. (CREAKING) (DINOSAUR ROARING IN DISTANCE) (GRUNTING) (GROWLING SOFTLY) Do you remember the first time you saw a dinosaur? First time you see them, it's like a miracle. You read about them in books, you see the bones in museums, but you don't really believe it. They're like myths. And then you see that first one alive. This is not your fault. But it is. No. This one's on me. I showed them the way. Listen. You and I are gonna have plenty of time to talk about this later. If there is a later. Yes, there is. I got a cabin to finish. (THUD) (DINOSAUR GRUNTING) CLAIRE: What is that? Well, look who just woke up. (WHISTLES) Go. (ROARING) (THUD) We're getting out of here. Welcome, ladies, gentlemen, to this extraordinary evening.

So do I. Tell you what, you come on down from there, I'll tell you everything you need to know about Blue. That sound all right? All right, yeah. Come on down. CLAIRE: Sweetie, we need some help finding your grandfather. Can you take us to him? (SNIFFLES) No. You made it down here all by yourself, huh? Brave kid. Looks like you could use a friend. He's gone. Listen, I'll tell you what, we were just about to go and find our friends and then get the heck out of here. You wanna come with us? CLAIRE: We could use a friend, too. BUYER: (IN DISTANCE) 19.5! EVERSOLLI (IN DISTANCE) 19.5. Do I hear 20? Do I hear 20? 20? Thank you. Thank you. 20. Do I hear... $21 million! 21 million... (GAVEL BANGS) Sold! And now, ladies and gentlemen, that we are halfway through the evening... (GROWLING) ...we'd like to offer a special treat to our discriminating buyers. This evening we will preview a new asset that we've been developing. A creature of the future made from pieces of the past. Ladies and gentlemen, please be warned, this is the perfect blend of the two most dangerous creatures that have ever walked the earth. We call it the lndoraptor. (GROWLING) (ROARING) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) (ALL GASPING) The perfect weapon for the modern age. Built for combat. With tactical responses more acute than any human soldier. What is that thing? (ROARING) (ALL EXCLAIMING) MAISIE: They made it. Mr. Mills and the other man. What man? MAISIEI Him. EVERSOLL: Designed by Mr. Henry Wu with an intelligence quotient comparable to the Velociraptor. Biospecs include a heightened sense of smell and trained to respond to a pulse-coded laser targeting system, enabling it to isolate and track prey in complex environments. Voilà. Now, first, the laser sets the target. (G ROWLS) (ALL GASP) EVERSOLL: Once locked on, the acoustic signal triggers the attack. (HIGH-PITCHED TRILLING) (ROARING) (ALL GASP) (CHUCKLES) This animal is relentless. Now, modifications are still being made... 20 million! EVERSOLL: No, this is a prototype. Uh, not for sale. 21! It is still a prototype, but... BUYER 1 I 22! BUYER 2123! BUYER 3324! $24 million. 25 million! Do I hear 26? OWEN: That thing can't leave this building. BUYER 4126! Any advance on 26? 27! $27 million from the back. What are you doing? This animal is not for sale. If you wanna create an addict, you have to give them a taste. He's a prototype. This prototype is worth $28 million right now. Relax, we'll make some more. So will they. (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) (GROWLING) (CLATTERING) Hey, buddy. You thinking what I'm thinking? EVERSOLLI Once.

What, are you gonna go back in time before Hammond decided to play God? You can't put it back in the box! We have to try. It's too late. Maisie, come. Oh! So, you're gonna take care of her now? Huh? You have no idea what she is. What do you think drove Hammond and Lockwood apafl,huh? Lockwood never had a grandchild. He just wanted his daughter back. And he had the technology. He created another. He made her again. (MEN GROAN) (ROARS) (MAISIE SCREAMS) (MEN SCREAMING) Go. (ROARING) (MEN CONTINUE SCREAMING) Come on! (BREATHING SHAKILY) Come on. MAN: Eggs need to go in a sterile environment.

Get me 50 cos carfentanil and a phlebotomy kit! It's right there! Now! Come on. Come on. I need this raptor's blood. (ROARS) (YELPS) Sure, go ahead. Where is that kit? Okay, now listen to me. It is better for you to cooperate. I'm gonna get this blood with or without your help. This blood's contaminated. I designed this animal myself. It's pure. Every cell of her body was created in the most controlled environment under the most demanding of conditions. Yeah, but I did an intravenous blood transfusion with a T. rex, so, it's a sock drawer in there. You what? (GRUNTS) ZIA: Franklin! What are you doing? Saving your life! Yes! MAN: Stop! Don't move.

Too many red lines have been crossed. And our home has, in fundamental ways, been polluted by avarice and political megalomania. Genetic power has now been unleashed and of course, that's gonna be catastrophic. This change was inevitable from the moment we brought the first dinosaur back from extinction. (ROAR5) We convince ourselves that sudden change is something that happens outside the normal order of things, like a car crash, or that it's beyond our control, like a fatal illness. We don't conceive of sudden, radical, irrational change as woven into the very fabric of existence. Yet, I can assure you, it most assuredly is. And it's happening now. Humans and dinosaurs are now gonna be forced to coexist. (GROWLING) These creatures were here before us. And if we're not careful, they're gonna be here after.
