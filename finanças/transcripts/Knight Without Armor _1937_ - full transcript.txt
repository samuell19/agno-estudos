The terrible Vladinoffs, they may have a tip. You know, he used to run horses in Russia before he became minister of interior. Hello Alexandra. - Hello. - What do you backing? I suppose one really ought to put something on the king's horse. - How loyal. - In Russia you always back the tsar's horse? No, in Russia I genuinely back my father's horse, I do at least know they are trying. Oh, then you know more about them than I do my dear. - That's not very difficult Father. - There's the king's horse. - There's the king's horse. - There he goes. - Hello Fothergill, how did you find your... - Hello. Yes, my final visit to England. I'll I've left on the king's horse. - How much? - Five up. - Good luck. - Good luck. I see you've been press correspondent in Russia five years. - Yes. - Going back to the same job? No, this time I'm translating English novels for a publisher. - Have no difficulty with the language, eh? - No, very little in speaking and... - not much in writing. - When you leave? Tomorrow night, chain cross. Thank you. Goodbye Alexandra. And thank you for the lovely flowers, goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Alright Alex, I'm sorry you can't stay for shooting. Oh thanks, but there's plenty of shooting where I'm going. - Bear, wolves? - No, everything, even ministers. Take a seat, please. Excuse me sir. Dinner is served. Dinner is served. Why is the dining car always at the other end of the train? Hold your head up, Countess. Countess Olga Vesselro. Princess Nina Volchonsky. - Is my back all right? - For the tenth time, yes. Oh, I know I'm going to faint. Countess Vera Brastov. Countess Alexandra Vladinoff. Daughter of the minister, betrothed to Colonel Adraxine. Countess. We congratulate you, Colonel Adraxine is a very lucky man. What a lovely child. Anna Sprohoff. - What did His Majesty say? - He congratulate you. - Colonel Adraxine is a very lucky man. - And so I am. And Alexandra is a very lucky girl, aren't you darling? - Why, of course she is. - Of course I am. - I hope it will be a success. - Of course it will be. He is the greatest fool in the guard and she is the cleverest girl at court. Mr. Fothergill. Some more please, - Hello Fothergill. - Hello Stanfield. - You are in a hurry. - Yes, I've to go to the police. The police? Well, are you lunching at the London Tavern? - I hope so. Sorry, I'm late. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Tyevsky's Route, 40. - Anyway, you admit you write this article? - Of course. It's an attack on the imperial government. Not an attack, merely an account of the system of government. In your opinion, if you were Russian it would mean Siberia. Your permit to remain in Russia is canceled. But my whole future is bound up in Russia. You have 48 hours to get out. Look here see, you don't realize, I, I've worked here for years, I love Russia. I've tried to make the English understand that the Russian outlook... I'm sorry but I have 23 appointments before lunch. If everything else fired but it cleared out in 48 hours. 48 hours, two days. There it is, six years hard work completely chucked away. - There are other jobs, of course. - Not in Russia. - Certainly. - The police have chucked me out. - Not if you do the right job. - Well, what, for instance? The British Secret Service. - Be a spy? - Why not? You're not afraid of the word, you'd be serving your country. Wouldn't have to give anyone away, all we want is information. - Information of what? - The revolutionary movement. Now, my job is to recruit young Englishman like yourself... who can speak Russian well enough to pass as Russians. Go on, what's the catch? Well, if you're caught, your number is up. But I, I could claim British nationality, wouldn't I? No, you couldn't do that. If you did tell the truth, British authorities would... politely disclaim all knowledge of you. It is a case of, heads they win, tails I lose. - Bit one-sided, isn't it? - Well, it's the chance we all take. The pay is rather good. Would it interest you? No, I don't think so. - Oh, cream please. - Yes sir. Well, think it over. - How do you do Fothergill? - Good morning. Pleased to see you, come along. I'll introduce you to our general manager. Oh, thanks. Well, aren't you a bit surprised to see me this morning? Well, takes a good deal to surprise me, you know. This way. But surely the police will be there to see me off the premises, won't they? Naturally, at the evening, a man carrying your passport will leave Russia. You collect his luggage at the station and board the night express for Germany. That's the fellow you got to look like. - Peter Ouronov, who's Peter Ouronov? - You are. That's your name for the future, you'd better memorize it. And what's Peter Ouronov's first job? To join the revolutionary movement. There's a man named Axelstein, he runs a bookshop.. I've got the pamphlets from Zorin but think the distribution will be difficult. - You think you can manage? - I'll do my best. Ah, it's lovely, beautiful. Yes, that's the 1840 edition. Do you seen Maronin today? No, he ought to have been here half an hour ago. Hope nothing is happened to him, such a hot head.. - What about this one? - Yes, that's very good. - Maronin? - You know what happened? For the third time this month, 20 students arrested. - 20? - Yes, 20. Five of them gassed. You know what that means? Exiles in the north and their work stopped. - Sounds dreadful. - Yes, you said dreadful. - What do we do? Nothing. - No, no, no... Does anyone ever do anything? We just talk and talk and talk. Quiet, you young fool, if you want to talk... I, I have taken the liberty of telling your Excellency's coachman... - to go by the Nietshoc Bridge. - But that's a long way around. I have to meet my daughter and it's already... - Fit Your Excellency. - Pard me Excellency. - Prudence your Excellency, is essential... - Prudence? That your show of police around with him, insights the terrorists. But I am personally responsible to His Majesty for your Excellency's life. - Oh, let's go, let's go. - If I could... Do you like it Father? - Are you happy dear? Really happy? - Of course dear. God bless you my darling. I'll be ready in a few minutes, can I come home with you? No, not in my carriage, I couldn't risk it. Not as things are just now. Hello darling. It's all too vague, it's no proper plan. Anyway, we haven't got the package through Norway yet. - I have enough jelly left for two oranges. - We need four. - Maronin is quite sure of himself. - Oh, his impatience will ruin everything. Maronin is an impulsive nut, what's more, he's always late, half past nine. - Here he comes. - At last. - You're late. - I'm sorry, I had a client. - May I? - Yes, go ahead. A client, a police officer I couldn't get rid of him. We all agreed that the business must be postponed. - No, I agree with Maronin. - There's no time to work out a proper plan. Oh, all I need to know is the route and the time. The wedding procession is across the bridge at 5:15, the second carriage is Vladinoff's. What the devil you doing here? Look at this place, close the bridge. - Call the ambulance. - Right sir. Warn the horsemen. - You, phone the minister. - Yes sir. Are you all right? - Is my father hurt? - His Excellency is safe. - He's not wounded? - Not a scratch Countess. Thank God. - Father, father... - It's all right my dear, it's all right. You get in the next carriage. Come in. Come in. Alexis? What's, what's the matter? What is it? What's, what's happened? - Nothing, it's all right. - Come over here. Whatever happened? They got me, he fired as I ran. Just out right, through the buff. - You mind if I stay here a little while? - No, no, of course not. - There may be danger to you. - Danger? Don't be a fool. I'm sorry to be such a bother to you. Go on, forward. - You political prisoner? - Yes, but I'm no better off than you. - Tell me, how far is to Siberia? - Take us at least six weeks. Something ought be done about these dining cars. Lunch wasn't good but their dinner was simply uneatable. As a soldier I'm accustomed to privations... but the caviar was filthy and the champagne is certainly not 1906. Now what the devil is happened? - The train stopped sir. - I know that, you fool. What for? I'll go and see sir. - Colonel Adraxine? - Yes. Urgent dispatch Colonel. Bad news? Splendid news, general mobilization. You know what that means? - War. - War, at last. Prisoners for Vatterus get ready to leave. - Hoflosev. - Yes. - Bernstein. - Yeap. - Nevski. - Yeah. - Osipenko, Osipenko. - He's there. - He's a fever. - Never mind, come and help him up. Come on, get up there, come on. - There's a doctor where you're going. - All right. - Rinkoff. - Yeah. - Payden. - Yeah. - Chiskim. - Yeah. Go. - Give me four packages of that... - You can only have two. - How's that? - The most we're allowed to sell prisoners. - It'll have to do then. - Give me two. - Sugar? - Over there. - Excuse me Captain, are we to remain here? - What's your name? Ouronov, Axelstein. Axelstein? - No, you're to go to Roskovensky. - Roskovensky, I never heard of that. I have. - Here? - No, east of that. - About here? - Somewhere there. It's over 1,000 berths north of here. - The world's end. - Yes, the world's end. - We're leaving in a few minutes, get ready. - This has just come. Spreads like fire, doesn't it? Yes, looks as though all the European countries will soon be involved. Ready sir? - The sled is here. - Ready? The sled is here, we can start out. Would you mind telling us the latest news, we've heard nothing for several weeks. - You knew Russia was at war, didn't you? - No, we didn't, with what country? Germany, France, England, Austria, they're all it. - Not England? - Yes, England. - Looks as if the whole world is coming in. - England? Well, war is one thing you won't to have to worry about Roskovensky. - War. - That's what we'd been waiting for. Come on, come on. Last in, come on, get at. - Ouronov, what's the time? - What is that matter? Night for six months... and a blasted cold hell for two years. It's 11:33 in the morning, if you're really interested. Nights, nights, nights. Night, always nights. Never ending night. Nothing but night over all year. The sun must be dead. Everything must be dead. We're the last things alive. Sorry Axelstein. I've to be melodramatic once in a while. Calendar finished yet? I can't be quite sure whether it's March the 15th or the 16th. - I suppose it makes little difference. - Well, at least we do know that it is 1916. Two years in this frozen hell... while the rest of the world turn upside down and inside out and no tobacco. I've been working out a theory Ouronov. The Imperial Army is sure to be defeated. Perhaps, even now the war is over. Russia's fate is in the hands of her own people. There's bound to be a revolution. Ah, and listen to this. Comrades, the work fellas and people, the last hour of the struggle is here. With a fist of arms, we must wipe out the bourgeois... and aristocrats from the face of the earth. Death or victory, now or never. Comrades, on behalf of the Soviets of Klintsy I ask you to honor us Comrade Axelstein... by accepting the position of chairman of the Soviets of our town. All you have skilled work will have to join the Red Army, fall in. Next. - Have you any papers? - Come with me. - Just a minute. - It's Comrade Axelstein. - I'll take it. - Oh, thank you. This is my dear comrade and friend... Peter Ouronov, the man who was sentenced with me to exile. You can't go home now... they've made me Commissar of Klintsy and you're my assistant. Olga... Paola, Elizabeth... Elizabeth... Elizabeth... Ivan, Ivan... Martha, Martha Bedoyna... - What do you waiting for? - Come on. What's the matter with you? She's only a woman. I wasn't trying to get away, I was, I was born here. Born here were you, well, now you can die here. See to it. The next one. Give me shirt, give me shirt. - Is she in there? - Yes. - Can we have a look at her? - No. My orders are to wait until Comrade Axelstein arrives. - Take away. - See that you carry them out. And what is more, all this senseless destruction is got to stop. Don't you understand? You're destroying... - the property of the people. - All right, all right. The point is what we going to do with the woman, I say shoot her and be done with it. - No. - Why not? Here is an order requiring us to send her to Petrograd for... Waste of time, Wee got the rifles, we got the wall and we've got the woman. - And we got the order. - Here, whose side are you on? - On the side of revolutionary discipline. - Revolutionary fiddlesticks. How much is she promised you to let her go? Be careful Tomsky or I shall report you to the Central Committee. Report me? You'll hear some reports before the night is out, I promise you. There's going to be trouble here unless we get her away. - Yes, and not much time to lose. - Well, it's up to you. You start at once, you can reach Saratuse before dawn and take the train to Petrograd. Get up please, get up. - Who are you? - I'm the assistant Commissar. I'm ready. Wait. - Am I not to be shot? - No. But I want to be shot, I hate you all, I despise you. You're red vermin, long live Russia, long live the tsar. - What must I say to make you kill me? - I have to take you to Petrograd. - Why? - By order of the government. - Then in Petrograd? - That I don't know. But they'll kill me in Petrograd, why not here? I have my orders. And I must obey them, I'm sorry. And it's better that you should obey them too. - Why? - Well, it's better. - Let's go then. - You can't go like that. Unless you want them to tear you to pieces? I'll try and find you something that will make you less conspicuous. Parator Station as quick as you can and don't step for anything. Come along, better hurry. Halt, stop the horses. Stop those horses. - Your orders? - Axelstein. It's cold, don't you let me put this around you? Already dawn. Wait. Station master? Station master? Good morning, comrade. - You are the station master I suppose? - I am the station master. When you expect the next train to Petrograd? - Train number 617 to Petrograd at 2:20 PM. - Will it be on time? The 2:20 is always on time. Go back to Klintsy and report to... Comrade Axelstein that I'm at the first train from Saratuse. I was to go with you comrade. You go back to Klintsy and report as ordered. I go back to Klintsy comrade, and report as ordered. You know you've nothing to fear from me, don't you? I know Commissar. - Where the guards? - I sent them back to Klintsy. - Were those your orders? - No. - Thank you. - Why did you send them back? - Didn't like the look of them. - Were you afraid of them? Afraid for me? Now that you're alone, aren't you afraid that I'd try to escape? Where could you go? Yes, you're right. Where could I go? Go back to Klintsy, Comrade Commissar. He wants the woman to himself. There's plenty of money, did you not see it? I did, go back to Klintsy, eh? - Yes. - Afterward. And report that he joined the train at Saratuse, eh? You've got it. Thank you. - What's your name Commissar? - My name is Peter Ouronov. Peter Ouronov? - Where are you from? - Oh, you wouldn't know the place. - Oh, sorry. - It's far away? Very far away. - You know my name? - Yes I know, is Alexandra. - Were you living in Petrograd? - Well, I was but I'm not to leave my orders. Oh yes, your orders. Take your seats, please, Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd... Take your seats, please, Kazan, Moscow... What did he say the train? I didn't hear any, did you? Hey, just a minute. I, wait here, I'll go and see. Take your seats please, Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd. Take your seats please, Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd. Take your seats, please, Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd. Take your seats please, Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd. Where is train? Take your seats, please, Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd. But I don't see the train. The train is that are seen are being blown up. - Is the train coming? - No, it's mistake. I'm afraid we're in for rather a long way. Think you better try and get some sleep. It's not very comfortable but don't know when you'll get another opportunity. You're very tired, you know. - Please try and sleep. - Thank you. Why don't you try and get some sleep? No I, I think I'd better stay awake. - Where are you Commissar? - I'm here. Why is it all so quiet? At stations one always hears whistles, signals, bells. Well, the bells are out of order, try to sleep. I can't sleep. Been trying to pray. - You don't pray, of course Commissar. - Sometimes. When I was having long sleepless nights I used to try to repeat verses to myself. - You had sleepless nights? - Siberia. - What verses? - Oh, Shakespeare, Browning, Shelley. But they are English poets. - Have you been a student in Petrograd? - No, at Oxford. But it was very seldom that Russian students went to Oxford. My father wanted me to go to Oxford. I see. Say some of your verses. - Browning. - Browning? You must not fear death... fear death to feel the fog in my throat, the mist in my face. - Oh, I'm afraid I'd be boring you. - Go on. Well, just the end, I admire it. For sudden the worst turns the best to the brave. The black minutes at end. And the elements rage, the fiend voices that rave... shall dwindle, shall blend, shall change, shall become... first a piece out of pain, then a light, then thy breast. Oh, thou soul of my soul, I shall clasp thee again. And with God be the rest. - You like it? - It's optimistic, like the English. Listen to a Russian poem. It is hopeless and pessimistic, like we Russians. I have grown weary of my little dreams. I have outlived the hour of my desire. Alone with tortured empty heart I will be... beside the ashes of their dead gray fire. The lasting wind of destiny has blown the roses of my glory with its breath. Go on, don't stop. - And listen for the shambling feet of death. - Louder, louder. Since solitude has made winter in my heart, now like the last frayed lonely leaf am I. Know how to use it? Go on. Get back. It weighs upon the storm, right forest bound... - Why did I do that? - Was in self-defense. You saved my life and probably your own as well. Train number 617, train number 617. Train number 617. - I'm going to... - Do you strong enough? - I'm alright to wait outside for the train. - I'm afraid there are no trains. No train? What are all these people hurrying for? Take your seats please, Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd. Take your seats please, Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd. Take your seats please, Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd. Take, wake up, wake up, take your seat, take your seat please. Take your seats, take your seats please. Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd, take your seats please. Take your seats. Kazan, Moscow, Petrograd. - Just a moment, just a moment. - No, leave me lone. I'm not going to hurt you. All I want to know is where you're going. - The forest. - The forest, why? To hide? Come on, you can tell me. Fresh soldiers, they was headed to us, the other army. Which? The whites? Come on, you can tell me. I'm not going to hurt you, all I want to know is which, the reds or the whites? - The whites. - Are you sure? Yes, Cossacks, Cossacks. All right, go. Did you hear that? - Seems the Whites have retaken Saratuse. - I heard it. Well, it's about a mile from here, can you manage it? - Yes. - Come on then. - Cossacks, it is the White Army. - Yes, it's the White Army. Go to the outpost, you better shout out as you get near in case they try to shoot you. Ask at once for an officer. Tell him who you are and tell him to take you to the Commandant. Say that you've escaped from a Red Commissar who was taking you to Petrograd. Ask for his help and try to get at once to the south. Goodbye. - And you? - Oh no, I'll be all right. Safe journey to you. - Would you allow me to thank you? - No, no, no. - Goodbye. - Comrade Ouronov? Yes? - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Outpost number four. All right, pass. - Next? - Anton Pakrovsky. Red town Commissar. - Anything to say? - I am a peaceful citizen. I was made Commissar against my will. Take him out. But Captain, I am innocent, I swear it, I am innocent Captain. - You don't understand Captain. - Next. Vivan Lupien. Corporal Tamaneff of outpost four reporting a prisoner. What's she been doing? Came to the outpost and wanted to see the commanding officer. - Your name? - I'm the Countess Adraxine. I want to see the commanding officer. - And what business had you at the outpost? - I want to see the commanding officer. - Answer my question. - Are you the commanding officer? Answer my question or you'll be sorry for it. General... - Alexandra Nicolei. - Andreyevitch. My dear Alexandra. But what in heaven's name is all this? I very stubbornly insisted on seeing the commanding officer. And the captain, very rightly, wanted to know what I was doing here. Come with me Sasha, we'll look after you. Why, in a week we shall retake Klintsy. Yes, you will be back in your own home. - Could I possibly have a bath? - Yes, certainly. - Karevsky? - Coming Excellency. Here, Excellency. The best room you have for the countess and a bath. Well, I can manage the bath your Excellency but... - There's no but. - Well Excellency, there's no soap. Lieutenant Gregorin? - Yes sir? - A cake of soap for the countess. - Yes sir. - Thank you, General. - I'm sorry to give you so much trouble. - Oh, it's no trouble at all. - And I hope you'll preside at our dinner. - I would love to. But I can't appear like this. Certainly do something about it. - What about this one? - It's getting better. - And aren't they wanting you in the house? - Yes, them want. I think is somebody at the door. - Dresses for the countess. - Good gracious. I hope you brought enough. Well, she can't dine with us without a frock. No, more is a pity. You don't know what you're missing. Your dresses have come. I think there are about 50 of them. Will you please go and lay them out on the bed? Gentlemen... Go on, please don't stop. Will you have a glass of champagne Countess? - You all right Sasha? - Yes. But I can't believe that I'm really here. In safety with friends... - and to hear music again. - Yes, it's all over Sasha. Cheer up. - Now Countess, what are your plans? - To leave Russia. Leave Russia? Why, in another month, we shall be in Petrograd. - Of course. - You are coming home with us. Shall we dine? - What was that? - No cause for anxiety, Sasha. - What was it? - Just a matter of routine. They weren't killing the Red prisoners? They were executing some commissars and a few other Red bandits. Where are you going? Well, I lost the company, I've been on patrol duty. Fall in with us, we storm Saratuse in an hour. Get up, the Reds are here. Get up, you fool, the Reds are here.. Get in the cellar, down there. - Lukovsky. - Here at your service comrade. This vodka is filthy stuff. You can do better than this. Well, I have some special bottles in the cellar but there's not enough for everybody., Everybody? But I'm not everybody. - Bring them up. - At once comrade. Nikolai Rakof. The former of the White murderers. - Responsible for the death of 43 comrades. - I tried to save all I could. - I can bring witnesses. - Take him away. - Don't, don't, comrade... - Next. Fellow comrade, without me they can decide nothing. - Who? - The commissars. What's more, they're all cowards. - To your health. - Good health to the delegates. - Good health to the delegates. - This is my round. - Welcome comrade, come on. - They get treating us all. - Oh, no, no thanks. - Come on, drink, come on. - Come on, have a drink. - Have a drink. - Why worry? - Forget it. Drink. - That's better. - Shall I tell you a great secret? Soldiers are soldiers. White or Red, there's no difference. They can order you about but what can they do? Shoot, kill, destroy but, but I organize. - Can you organize comrade? - Yeah. The reorganization of the economic life... on the basis of the ex-appropriation of the means of production. Bravo. Did you understand that? - Yeah. - You did? Do you want to reorganize the boot factory? I'll make you commissar for reorganizing the boot factory. No? Theater? No? Electricity, that's very important. We're going to electrify the whole country. Prisons? No? - Hotels? - Oh, what did you say about prisons comrade? We'll reorganize everything. There it is. With my signature on that commission, you'd be in charge of the prisons. Good health to the comrades. Bravo, bravo. - Reorganize everything. - Every real thing. You organize everything, eh? - What's become of this Countess Adraxine? - She's in the prison. Take two men and bring her here. Hello comrade, what about a little vodka before we go home? No, brother, we better not, drink it yourself. Very sorry comrade, the woman prisoner is already been released. - What? What on earth? - The commissar went to the prison. - What? Stop that brawl there. Commissar? - Yes, with a special order. Devil he did, what fools we've been. We must get them both, man and woman. Call a search party. Send a hundred men. - A hundred men? - A hundred men. - Don't sit down there waiting, get on. - Come on. - Can we rest here? - Yes. - We safe here? - I hope so. - There must be brook somewhere. - The Gulburch Brook. - You know this forest? - Belongs to me. It belonged to me. We mustn't rest here any longer. I'm on the run now as well as you. - Shall we go? - Not just yet. Why? I'm afraid the searchers are coming in the forest. What do you want me to do? There someone in the woods, not far from here. Think we'll be safe here. - You keep your nerve now, won't you? - Yes. Swear you'll kill me before you let them get me. Swear. Alright, I swear. Get in there, they're coming through. It's our only chance. Keep still, don't move, don't say a word. - Found anything yet? - Who are you? - You're not our company. - No. - What company are you? - What? Third. What the digging you doing here? This is our beat. Oh, it's the devil's own job comrade, I... I'm no forester and I lost my way because I lost my whistle. - You're not going to drink alone? - No, only an ox drinks alone, have it. How can I answer? I've lost my whistle. You let me drink and I'll whistle, will you? - Let's sit here and finish this. - No, no, we can finish that as we go along. - Come on, they'll be looking for us comrade. - Oh, it's a dog's life comrade. Where are you going? - They're over there. - No, they're not, they're there. - We heard them. - Is he with that outfit? No, no, I'm with the others. Oh, he's all right, we can go along together. - Is the flask empty? - Not quite. Hello? Hello? - Don't be afraid, tell me where you are. - Here I am. Were you thinking that I wouldn't come back for you? When did you fall in love with me? First time I saw you, get up I said, get up. You turned and I was lost. Listen. Good news. - What is it? - Heavy guns. Mean they're fighting again. They'll give up the search. And in a few days, we'll be able to leave the forest. Don't you like my forest? I adore it. Hello, comrade. - Any luck? - The skies opened and mana fell from heaven. You ready? Catch. Did you call this outfit mana? Well, I thought we'd better look like refugees than soldiers. Keep still just a minute, there. - Come here. - I wanted to see myself. Careful. Where did you pick them up? Pick them up? If you'd heard me bargaining for them and for the other things. - Did you bring some food too? - Did I bring some food? I don't believe it. - Lobster. - Yes. - Jam. - And... Brandy. There's enough there to last us for days and days. I think that old boy must be the champion looter of the revolution. - And all he wanted was your wristwatch? - Well, what's the use of a wristwatch... in a country where trains are apt to be a week late? Oh, yes, train. - We have to find the train. - And we can. The old boy tell me, we're not very far from the line to Kazan. We must go down into the plain. - How far is it to the nearest station? - The nearest station? There 10,000 people waiting for the train at every station, just wait here. You'll see, we'll stop them. Get out of the way, get off the track. Get out. Stop. The train is full. Get out. There's no room in here. Get out of me. - Please, my sister can't walk anymore. - Let go of me and get off. Come on, where there's so many there's room for two more, come on. Very nice, would you like them comrade? Do you like me comrade? Nobody can leave the station without a pass from the commissar. Right. - Show your hands. - Pass. Inside. Pass. - Pass. - Show your hands. Inside. - Inside. - They allowed you to go. - Go, please. - Pass. - The name? - Fredo Moramo. - From? - Moscow. - Where you going? - Astrakand. - What for? - To be with my family. - What was your job in Moscow? - I was a clerk in an insurance office. Every word a lie, you're Conola, managing director of the Pudalafki works in Petrograd. You financed the White bandits. You conspired against the Republic of Workers and Peasants. You're a fugitive from the justice of the people. And you're on your way to the White Army. Condemned to be shot. Next. Show me your hands. - Why did you send him in? - I didn't Comrade Pushkov. - He came with the woman. - Who is the woman? My sister. Step up, show me your hands. These are the hands of a woman who... never worked in her life. - Your occupation? - I was a lady's maid. Worst sort of counter revolutionaries. Like relics, lady's maids. - Your name? - Anton Andrea. - From? - Tchekerovsky. - To? - Subhorsk. - What for? - I have a brother there. My sister needs nursing. - Why? - She was ill. - What illness? - Typhoid comrade. - Why aren't you in the army? - I was ill. You too? Sensitive family. 3/4 of the population of Tchekerovsky were sick with typhoid. - What's your occupation? - Electrician. The army needs electricians. I'll leave my sister with my brother and report for service in the army. Pass. Countess. Good afternoon, well rehearsed. Countess Alexandra Adraxine, nee Vladinoff. Daughter of the bloodhound Vladinoff, fugitive from the People's Justice. - What is your name? - Maria Andreas. Don't be ridiculous Pushkov, look. Yes, there's a slight resemblance. - Slight? - Slight. - Well, what else I need to prove her guilty? - Proofs, witnesses. - What? Expect a grand duke to turn up? - No, but there's Lieschen. What about Lieschen? Lieschen was a gardener on the Adraxine estate. - I'll fetch him. - Stand back. Next. - Your name? - Ivan Smirnoff. Just my size. Load. Present, fire. Did you find anything on him? Yes comrade, sewn in the lining of his coat. A White spy, condemned to be shot. Come here, stand here. Turn your face to him. Lieschen, look at that woman. - Who is she? - I don't know comrade. - Have you never seen her before? - Never comrade. Lieschen, you were a gardener on the Adraxine estate. - I was. - You ever see the countess? Very often comrade. Are you ready to swear that this woman is not the countess? In front of the altar comrade. That's all, take her to the guard room. And now what? Honored guests of the revolution? No, I have to report to the checker in Samara, I'll take them with me. Waste of time. We've no right to shoot this woman unless we can prove her guilty. - Rubbish. - If found guilty, they'll both be shot. - The train leaves in an hour. - Next. Next, next. Pass. Blankets? Blankets. I'm afraid it was an ordeal for your sister, I'm sorry, but we can't be too careful. Yes, yes, of course. I think it best that we make ready for the night straight away. - Oh, let me help. - Thank you. - You must be tired out and ready for sleep. - Yes, I'm tired. Oh, let me go up there. - It's Quite all right, you go below. - No, but, surely... - I really insist. - Oh, it's very good of you. - When do we get to Samara? - Tomorrow evening. - Tomorrow evening? - Yes. - Are you all right? - Yes, thank you very much. I'm afraid you won't find it very comfortable here. Feels quite luxurious to us, we've been traveling for three days in a cattle truck. - Shall I shade the light? - Yes, thank you. - Good night. - Good night. Good night. - Where could that other boot have got to? - Oh, here it is. Thank you. Hello? - No more commissar? - No, I didn't hear him go. - Don't worry, he won't be far away. - What you think of the fella? - Was very polite. - Well, that's something, anyway. What's more, he strikes me as an honest man. You're right. That's not going to make things any easier for us. Come in. - Oh, tea. - Yes, I got it from the engine driver. Thank you. - No thank you, I've had some. - Are you sure? Yes, really. Well commissar, are we going to face another trial in Samara? Yes, I'm afraid so. And when that happens, perhaps it might be wiser... to tell a more convincing story about yourselves. Don't you think we were speaking the truth then? Would ever be truth without trust. You, for instance, don't trust me, obviously not. - At any rate, we owe you our lives. - Even that was a matter of hard lying. You should thank Lieschen, he's a marvelous liar. Shouldn't we also thank you commissar, for telling him what lie to tell? Oh no, no, you mustn't think it like that. My own lie was a very poor one compared with Lieschen's. What was your lie? When I said that photograph bore only a slight resemblance to you. Actually, I thought it a pretty good one. - You don't think I'm going to admit it. - No, of course not. Don't let's admit anything. I don't really care who you are. - Yet you made every effort to save my life. - That was because I like you. Did you? Well... since you don't care who I am, there's no reason why we all... shouldn't be the greatest of friends. Oh I hope that perhaps you share some food that I've got. I'm afraid the bread is very stale but there's a little cheese to go with it. Don't you think, if the commissar is so kind we might share our food? - We brought some with us too. - Oh? Oh but, oh but this is amazing. To think that I offered you my stale bread. We are very grateful for it. - I haven't had a picnic like this for years. - There's even enough for supper tonight. And this to wash it down. - You don't know Samara? - No. Our army is just take it from the very important people... all kinds of people, who are all kinds of things before the revolution. There are bound to be many who knew the Countess Adraxine in person. And no Lieschens, eh? The perfect Lieschen is the rarest of all creatures. I see. So you're warning us. Hardly as much as that, but I'm wondering what's going to happen to you. - I mean, none of us know that. - No way. No, but I thought you might possibly have something in mind. I'm afraid we just do what we can as a rule. - Don't we? - Me and you. - Just take a chance if it comes along. - What else can we do? - You had luck so far? - A wonderful luck. And the most wonderful of all was to meet you. Do you think so? Yes, I do think so, even if tomorrow means the end of us. As it may do. Tomorrow may mean the end of me too, if it does... will you remember me? Forgive me for saying that your sister. I understand Pushkov, we both understand. Before we reach Samara tomorrow, I'd like... Oh I, I most humbly beg your pardon. I don't know what you must think of me behaving like this. I think this brandy, I'm not used to it, I... No it's, it's quite understandable. We've all been through a great strain. Isn't it good to stretch your legs again? How peaceful. This is just a small place on the Volga. If you go down there, you come to the river in about 10 minutes. See some barges tied up for the bank for the night. Believe they sometimes take a passenger if there money to pay. Some of the barge men are Tartars grand old fellas. This is really the most interesting part of Russia. Only so few people see it. Excuse me, I must go and get our order stamped by the commissar. You know, I, I pity him in a way, he's such a boy.. Do you realize we've got to escape now? It's almost dark and there's mist. - We should've a chance, surely. - Yes, I believe you're right, we should. - How with the boy? - What about him? He might, he might suffer for it. Yes, that's true. What's happened? - The commissar shot himself. - Deliberately, through the head. Oh dearest, quickly. There's no time. What is it? What is it? I just realized that, that if this is what he wanted us to do. Of course. Come. Forgive me dearest, we're going too fast for you. A train, the train... What is it darling? What is it? Do you hear the whistle? Do you hear the whistle? Don't leave me. We're approaching Astrakand. As soon as we arrive I'll fetch a doctor. Papers? None? Go on. Everyone on deck, medical inspection. Nobody else on the barge? Nobody ill? - Come on, speak up. - A woman, a man is gone for a doctor. Well, I'm a doctor. Now dear children, don't be frightened, we won't eat you. Here, take this, it's chocolate. - Stretcher. - Coming sir. - Attention. - Attention, attention. Anisimov. Sparisov. Lewkin. Arbukov, Nebralenko. Ivanovski. Lomov. Muspin. No, no, no, no. No, no, no. Calinin, Ouronov. - Ouronov. - Ouronov. Where is Ouronov? Pevich. Trustav. - Are you ready? - All ready to fire sir. - Stop, stop. - When the next batch can go, launch them on. Right, left, keep march. Get up, what are you doing? Get on. In a few minutes, it won't hurt you anymore. Shoot you fool, get after him. Hey, young fella, what you doing here? Doctor. - Well? - I just saw him go somewhere in there sir. Hear, you can't go in there, this is Red Cross Hospital. - There's an operation going on. - Well, I'll wait till it's over. I know this is unbelievable doctor... I've no proof, I've no papers, nothing but you must believe me. - I'm no cause to be here but for her. - Of course I believe you, will you be quiet? How can I tie up your wound if you don't stay still? - It's all right, I'll keep still. - Nurse... - Yes, doctor? - Let me go that list. Yes sir. Read out the names of the women leaving for Bucharest. Elisabeth Von Samnov Pachova. Anna Grigorovich, Maria Ocash. Sofia Lyevich, Baronet Maria Nithrop Narozen, Countess Alexandra Nicolaiva Adraxi... - Adraxine, you mean she's on that train? - It's too late. Get out of my way, I have to take that train. Alexandra, Alexandra... - Alexandra. - Here, here.
