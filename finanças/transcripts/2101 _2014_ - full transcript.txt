- [Craig] Engine. (imitating engine roaring) Come on, Patrick. - [Patrick] I'm coming. (high, steady tone) (growling and creaking) (tense, eerie music) - What's that? (exhaling) For the one, Dustin. Patrick, come here. (scary music) - Whoa. - Patrick, go check if someone's here. Wow. (scrambled, chaotic music) (buzzing) (static buzzing) (popping) (deep, scary music) Patrick. (deep, suspenseful music) (birds chirping) - I gotta get it done before you it's always the same. - I understand. - [Guy In White Shirt] Hey you gonna be in class next week? - I don't know, we'll see what my test says. - I thought you did well on that test. - Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, no, I did. I was just makin' a joke. - Right. - Come on, you know me. I always find a way to a pass. - Ah, the generic mayonnaise shit, can't we get some real mayonnaise? - Hey sweetie, hey Jessica. - [Jessica] Hi, Mrs. Collins. - How was your test? - [Shia] Don't know yet, just finished. - It better be good. - How was your test, Jessica? - Better. - Where are you going with all of that? - If I'm gonna study I need energy. - Energy or diabetes? - [Shia] We'll be upstairs. - You need to train him up, Jessica. - I've tried. His head's way too thick. - That's why we need a vacation. - Aren't you gonna study? - I'm sick of school work, Jessie. I just wanna work on my car. - (sighing) Your grades need more work than that shit box. - Why you gotta call it a shit box? It just needs some work. - What needs work are your grades. - I hate school, hate it. - Where you goin'? - [Shia] Gonna go work on my car, you wanna come? - No, we're studying. - Well I'm leaving so, let me know what Hogan and Millen have to say. - Shia. Hate it when he does that. Is there any specific reason why we cannot just drive there? - I like the adventure, let's go. - Come on Shia, wait up. (eerie, suspenseful music) (rapid beeping) - Five, call Donnie for me, would you? Don dog, I'm at the spot. Wanna come on and help me out with this thing? - I don't wanna help any more with that junk wagon. - It's not a junk wagon, it just needs some work. - Wow, nice ride. - I just saw that. - It's comin' along real nice. - I'm not comin' down there. Let's just stick with our plan for tomorrow. - Temple, come on, what's tomorrow again? Donnie! - Looks like you're on your own, Shia. (deep suspenseful music) - Jessica, come here. (tense, suspenseful music) - What? - Who the hell is that? - Probably the people who own this place. - No, no the state owns this, this is state property. I've never even adventured over there, you wanna go check it out? - There's a no trespassing sign. - Good leading, let's go check it out. - I'm staying here, Shia. - All right, well then you stay here and I'll go. - [Jessica] You're actually gonna leave me here by myself? - I'll be back in 15. (deep, scary music) (tense, suspenseful music) (scary music) (deep, reverberating music) (wood cracking) (scary music) (steady tone) (steady tone becoming louder) (buzzing) (object clunking) Shit. What the hell? (scary, suspenseful music) - See anything over there, detective? Also, stop leaving me. Respect the fact that I go through all of these little adventures for you. - Actually, I did. Well you can barely function without me. - [Jessica] What is that? - Just some futuristic device that tried to kill me. Shoulda came with. (tense, eerie music) - What, what is it? (tense, scary music) Shia! - What is that thing? What did you do over there? Is that thing tracking us? - Shh! - What's goin' on with this? - Let me look it up. It's a restricted area. All right, let's get the guns, we'll go in. - Shit. Shit. - [Jessica] What is it now, Shia? - Grab your books and shit and get over here. - Shia, you've got this, just go outside and tell them you're sorry for trespassing and give it back. We need to get out of here. - Just shut up. You owe me now, come on. - [Jessica] Shia, just give it back. - [Shia] No. - [Jessica] Can't we just get outta here? - [Shia] It's a little too late for that, come on. - [Jessica] You had to go into a no trespassing area, didn't you? You had to go back and find that stupid thing, and it's really not yours, and I don't understand-- - Shh. - why you're obsessed over this thing. (tense music) - It's locked. - Don't look at me, I don't have the damned keys. (high-pitched tone) - [Shia] Shit. You jackass. - Get up there and check it out. - How am I suppose to do that? - Scurry up that pipe. - I'm no damn rat. (clunking) - We'll deal with this later, let's go. (tense music) - (sighing) See, I told you that thing does something. (rocks clanking) - Seriously. - Hey, get the hell outta here, it's private property for god's sake. (bold, adventurous music) (snoring) (thudding against window) - We have a doorbell, psycho. - I rang it, now come on, let me in. Why didn't you answer the door the first time I rang it? - I didn't hear it, I was asleep. - It's 12:30! - I'm tired, I was out late last night. - Doing what? - [Shia] Shut the door. - Thanks for ditchin' me again. - Dude, I'm sorry. I had something more important actually than being a third wheel on your stupid morning dates. - Seriously? I finally found someone and all I ask is for you to help me out during the vital stages of my relati-- - Check this thing out. - [Donny] (laughing) You get that at Toys"R"Us? How is that more important than-- - No dude, check it out. The thing's legit. - It's heavy what, that makes it legit? - Yeah, it does something cool, it's like alive or something. - What, what's it do? - What? I don't know. - Well I thought you said this thing's legit. - It is. The first time I touched it, it tried to bite me. Then it started flashing lights and making all these sounds. But I haven't gotten it to do anything ever since. - Hm. Where'd you find this at? - At one of the facility buildings by our hideout. - You found this by the fort? - The fort? Really Donny, what are we, 12? - Dude, show me where you got this. - See, now you wanna check it out. - Do you wanna go or not? - Yeah, grab some flashlights. - Okay, and where are your parents? - I don't know, I think just shopping. - [Donny] Wow, this place is sweet. How come we never explored around here before? - [Shia] Because Magellan, you were always too scared. - Is this that place you found that thing in? - Yeah, somewhere in here. Watch your step. I fell through and landed underneath this whole thing. This is where I found the pyramid, you dumbass. - I don't see a hole anywhere, let's see if your buddy where we're at. - What? - That thing you showed me. That pyramid thing. - Oh, yeah, good idea, Don. - Wow, I wasn't serious. Well look at that, it's not doin' anything. - No shit, Donnie. Maybe if I move it around, it'll start beeping when I get near it. - Like Marco Polo, you get closer, you're warmer, you get further, your colder (laughing). You're losin' it man. - Yeah, wow. This is just like Marco Polo, asshole. (Shia crying out) Shit. Are we gonna go down there and get it? - [Don] No, damn place is like a sinkhole, let's leave. - [Shia] We gotta get ahold of it. - [Don] Eh, fuck. - Okay, on a count of three, you run. - [Don] Okay. - One, Two, hang on. I think I see someone. Okay, I think we're good. Let's go. - What the hell? (tense, adventurous music) Dammit. Craig! Entrance! Come on! Down and around, down and around. (tires squealing) - Shit, who the hell was that? - Oh my godfather Donnie, how the hell am I suppose to know. - Shit, he had a gun, he's probably coming after us. - Donnie relax, it's not like he has our address or anything. He doesn't know where we live or who we are. - Okay, you're right, good, that's a good thing. - But we have to go back in there and get that pyramid. - Shia, what are you talkin' about? We are not going back there. - Donnie, shut up. I felt something when it pecked my finger, I swear something happened. - Well then you're goin' alone 'cause I'm out, I quit. - Yeah well we both know you're coming with me so, I'll just go to my house. Hey mom, hey dad. - [Donnie] Mr. Collins, Mrs. Collins. - What are those two up to? - Who knows. - All right dude, here's our plan. First we're gonna go in, and then we're-- - Oh. - Does anyone know how to use a damn doorbell? - [Jessica] Hey. - Why didn't you use the doorbell? - [Jessica] Just come around and let me in. - Jess, we are really busy, what is it? - [Jess] I wanna talk. - [Donnie] She's pregnant, bro. - Dammit. - Where is it? - I lost 'em. - I swear that kid had somethin' in his hands earlier, but when he ran into me, he had nothin'. - If he had it, he'll be back. - Well if he lost it, why don't we go lookin' for it now. - 30 years we've been lookin' for this thing, we can wait a few more hours. - Do you think he has it? - I don't know. Let's get out of here. - As long as we stick to the plan, we'll be fine. - They have a gun Shia, they have a gun. - We'll be fine. When we get close, we'll park the bikes further than normal. Donnie, you'll get on top of the hideout and keep watch. Jessie, you'll come with me to get the pyramid. And Donnie, stop talking about their guns. We're not gonna get caught. This plan is ace. Everybody got it? - Got it, I'm ready to get my ass kicked. So much for finally getting a girlfriend. - Shia, why are you so into this thing? I told you I wanted nothing to do with it. - Donnie, shut up about your girlfriend. Grab the binoculars and put on a darker shit. Jessie, let's go, I wanna do this quick. - [Jessie] Shia, come on. (tense music) - [Donnie] I'm in place, you're good Ghostrider. - So are we clear? - Uh, yeah, yep, I don't think I see anybody. - You don't think, Donnie? Yeah, keep an eye out. All right, I'm turning on my light, tell me if you see any movement. (suspenseful music) All right, we got the gear, we're goin' in. (pop music playing) - [Donnie] Oh. - [Jessie] It's tied. - I didn't know your dad was the same size as me. - [Jessie] Yeah well, I guess we lucked out there. - Yeah. All right. If anyone comes, run, don't worry about me. - Please be careful, okay. - Keep watch. (suspenseful music) There you are. (groaning) - I got it. - Good, call Donnie. - Shit. - What? - He's not answering. - Well maybe it died. - No, it didn't go straight to voicemail. Stay with me. I'm gonna go get him, and get the hell outta here. (tense, suspenseful music) - Don, dude. - Set the device on the ground slowly. Let's go, come on, I don't have any damn time for this. Right there, that's right, right in front of your feet. Don't do anything stupid. - Quiet! - Let him go, we gave you the pyramid. - That's your plan, are you serious? - I know you gave me the pyramid. Why do you think I have this for? This is my time, not yours. I'm tired of you damn kids coming in and destroying my life's work. - [Female Voice] Get down. (exploding) (buzzing) (Jessie and Shia groaning) (funky buzzing and popping) (startling) (breathing heavily) (scary riff) - Jessica! Jessica! (scary riff) Jessica. Jess, come on. Jess, wake up. (Jessie inhaling) - Shia. - Jessie. Jessie. - Shia. Where are we? - I don't know, but it's beautiful, isn't it? - Wait. - What is it? - That thing, the pyramid. It took us somewhere. (mysterious music) - You're right, you're right. Where the hell are we? - The moons. Shia, this is a dream, it has to be. (watch zinging) (muffled voice from watch) - What is today's date? (dramatic music) - You're not gettin' anything out of me. - Will you shut your mouth, god! - No, you. - Shut up! Craig! - Will you shut him up for god's sake. - You'll shut up, right? - [Donnie] Who are you? (Donnie's voice muffled by tape) - What? - Get over here, I gotta show you something. - I will set you on fire. Uh. - I think our friend is gonna want this. - [Tallias] You are on the border head to the United Alliance. Caution, the protection of the Alliance is denied in these areas, head back now. - Well that just ruined our fun. - Caution what? Head back where? - What's the United Alliance? - [Tallias] This territory is not available. This is border command officer Tallias, you are in a hostile environment. If you and your accomplice do not surrender your GDR, we will take lethal action. You have 10 seconds to comply with this demand or you will be fired upon. (beeping and buzzing) - Hey, hey! What do you want? Hey, Tallias! - Shia, what should we do? (rumbling) - Did you hear that? (crying out) (muted, rippling tones) - No, it doesn't end like this. - Shia come on, we have to run. (exploding) (tense, suspenseful music) - Stop, don't go near it! - Can we trust it? - We really don't have a choice, do we? - Certain stop. (tense music) (weapon blasting) (aircraft engines roaring) - [Man On Left] That's not good enough. (deep tone) (exploding) (tense, eerie music) - [Shia] Hey Jessie, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine, it's just wearing off. - What's wearing off? - I'll tell you later. - You'll be back. You can't do anything without this. It's nice to finally stand eye-to-eye and talk about this like civilized people, isn't it? Even though I can't control this thing, I have learned one thing. This key I hold in my hand is the only way you're getting your answers. - You really like to play this game, don't you? - You listen here, this has been my dream, my memoir. You can't stake up in my house and steal my shit! - It isn't yours, you're the one who stole it. - Maybe next time we can resolve the situation more peacefully. Bring it back here, I will be waiting. Man to man, can I count on you? Can you help me? - I want this just as much as you do, you have my word. - I'll be seeing you. - Has the swelling gone down? - Yeah, the swelling's gone down. - Hey, you guys all right? - No, where the hell were you man? I was kidnapped for god's sakes, and you just decide to drop in whenever's convenient. Thanks for callin' back to get me, after two hours. - Well Shia, what even is that thing, where'd it come from, why do we have it? - I don't even know. It talks though, and it protects us every time we need it. - What do you mean, it talks? Make that thing say something. - I don't know how. I can't get it to do anything unless we're begin shot at or about to die. I can't tap into it and figure it out. - Well then just let it go Shia, it's not even worth it. I don't even wanna think about it anymore. - But you don't even know what it does. Jessie, it took us somewhere important. - I know it's a huge problem. Look, just let it go. If it doesn't say anything tomorrow, then fine. I do not wanna go through a crisis every single time you want it to do something. - But it was so awesome. - I'm with Jessie, I don't like havin' guns pointed at my head. - Fine, fine, fine, we'll just ignore it. We'll just ignore it for now. I'm starving though, can we go grab something to eat? - Yeah, I'm dyin' man, who's open at this time? - Gustavson's? - Yeah, god yeah. - Shouldn't we call the cops? - No, what the? - Absolutely not. I've had enough run-ins with the cops for a year. She's crazy bro. - [Shia] What the hell's wrong? - [Jessie] Place of champions. - Man, I don't know what it is about being kidnapped, shot at, and having your lives threatened by two guys who say they're gonna kill your family but, I've having the time of my life. - Well you weren't they one who was hell-born into a futuristic coma. - Whatever. At least your experience was sweet. I was all duct taped up until you guys decided to roll and have you blast the shit out of everybody and knock me on my face still taped up. (laughing) Hey, this is the girl I was tellin' you guys about, Malisha. Malisha, Shia. - Heard great things. - Jessica, Malisha. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Hey. All right enough, we got a date tonight. - We do? - That's right. I mean I got my ass kicked, but I still miss you. - God, I had a rough day, but not like yours. - [Jessie] Okay you two, have some fun then. - You don't want anymore pizza? - Naw, I'm good here, man. Ready to go a date with a pretty girl. You got the check, right? - Wow, seriously. - That's what I'm talkin' about, my man. - You two get outta here. Hey, we're doin' this again. - [Donnie] All right, peace out guys. - Jessica? - Yeah. - You ready to go? - [Jessie] Yeah, sure, why? - Can I show you something? - What do you wanna show me? - Well, we have to leave to go there. - [Jessie] What is this some kind of a date now? - Easy, I wouldn't call it that. Sorry I screwed up so bad back there. I didn't really mean to put you in any danger or anything, I wanted to see, I wanted to know what the perimeter's all about. I just thought-- - Don't worry about it, we're safe now. Those guys don't even know who we are or where we live, so as long as we don't go back there, we'll be all right. - That's the thing though, I wanna go back. - Why would you wanna go back to that? - To see what the pyramid's real purpose is, I, I can't get it to react alone. The only time it's done anything is when I've been there and in danger. - Well, going back there just to see it blink and make noise, isn't worth it. - A guy said when we were leaving, that guy said we'd be back. He knows I can't go on forever without figuring this thing out. He had somethin'. I think it's a key to make this thing work. - Shi, you shouldn't buy into that crap. - I know he probably just wants to kill me but, as long as I have their pyramid, I'll be all right. It's protected me every time, and you. - Well, even if you go in there, and he sprays bullets at you, and the pyramid protects you, what're you gonna learn from that? - I don't know. I just know that I need to get in there, peacefully, and somehow get that thing from them. Something tells me this is what gets this pyramid to work. What about when it took us to that place, couldn't you feel something, something special? I mean, even if it was just a dream, it made me feel something. - Shia, I trust you. I just don't want you to do anything that could get you killed. And, I still don't know how to take what happened. I just-- - Jessica, please. For me. I mean you're here alone, I'm here alone for weeks and we have nothing to do. I've always wanted an adventure. I feel like I can do this. - Shia, I still don't know what to make of it but, I wanna go back to reality but you know, just talk it over with Donnie, all right? - I will. I think he's gonna like it. - Absolutely not. I am not going back there again to get my face blown off. - Donnie, stop it. Relax, you're not gonna get your face blown off. I'll be right there with you. - Huh, yeah, until you decide to roll ahead with Jessie and ditch me and get slaughtered by your friends. They like you, I remember. - Donnie, that's not gonna happen. Even if it did, which it won't, it'll be so worth it if I could get what that guy had. - What the fuzz, no, forget it. What would be worth a blinking triangle, I'll make that for you. - Donnie, the thing is powerful, it's literally the future. It's not just some random toy. I don't know, I don't know what it is, and I don't know how to explain it to you but you saw what it did. We can't leave something like this undiscovered. - But you have it, just figure it out. - I've tried, I can't. I need what that guy has, now come on. Are you in on this? - Where are we meeting, when? And I don't even wanna understand why, so I'm not even going to ask. - Yes, all right, meet at my house tomorrow. We'll have a quick meeting and, I wanna do this during the day just in case there's a chance of something going wrong, someone can possibly hear us. - Fine, whatever, I'm sick of this, I want you to know that. I'm definitely not happy, hope you know that too. (door handle clanking) - Hey, thanks for letting me clean up here. Can I stay here tonight? - Your house doesn't work well? - It's my parents. I honestly don't feel safe unless I'm... - What? - [Jessie] Can I just stay here? - (sighing) Yeah, go ahead. - Okay um, this is hard to ask but, is it all right if I sleep in here? - You what? - I'm not gonna bug you, I just really wanna stay in here. - Okay well, I'll just curl up on the floor I guess, or go on the couch. - No, Shia, I just want some comfort. - Wow. Wow, all right. (slow, solemn piano music) (rocks clanking on window) - [Jessica] Shh! - [Donnie] Jessica, what the F? - Donnie what the hell, I told you to use the door. - [Donnie] I did, and what is this? - What's what? - [Donnie] Jessica, what is she doing in there? Come down and let me in. - Shi-. Haven't you heard of calling, or ringing the doorbell? - Ha, ha, ha, don't you get me started, don't you dare. First, I'm tired of you sleeping in on me all the time. And this time with (laughing). - Wanna look for some breakfast? - First I'm gonna see if I saw what I thought I saw. - See, what did I say? Stop being so paranoid. - I know she's hiding. (knocking at door) Get the hell outta here. No way. - Hey Jess. - Hey, hi Shia, hi Donnie. - Okay, I just seen your sorry ass upstairs, so what the hell's goin' on? - Dude, let it go. Now let's go find this thing out. I took this from my dad. - Whoa! - Shia, are you crazy? - No, we need it for protection. Here's the plan, Donnie and I are gonna go in. We can tell them you didn't come because you were too scared and all that, and they'll believe it. You're gonna be positioned right outside the building. If you hear anything, yelling or anything, you come in and you use that thing. I don't care, don't say anything, you're gonna save our lives if something happens. - Shia-- - Seriously, I don't wanna hear it. There is no plan because I don't know what's gonna happened so we're just winging it. - Winging it? Why'd I even come on this damn trip. - Donnie, nothing's gonna happen. Jesse, you shoot them if you need to. Just aim, pull the trigger, nothing ahared than that. - Actually, it's a lot harder than that. - [Shia] Let's go. (tense, scary music) - Oh! - Jessie, go. (tense, suspenseful music) - This key turns on that device. It only seems to work for you. You're going to help me. - I'm not helping you with anything! You lied to me, I knew it! I can't believe I actually thought we could make this happen. - You do not understand how much this thing has ruined us. Everyday, everyday! Like a huge weight on our shoulders. Nothing in life made any sense. And this is all we wanted to figure out. - You see, I've come to realize, I'm never gonna truly have that pyramid, and if I can't have it, nobody can. It isn't fair. I spent my whole life searching for it, and it's finally here, and I can't have it. - So, so, what are you gonna do? Your gonna lock it up in your basement forever? Or are you gonna let the person it was meant for use it for what it's worth, make the right choice! - Don't give me any psychological bullshit. - Seriously, you don't have to do it, you don't have to do it like this. There something in this, something for me to find-- (yelling) (gun firing) (exploding) (buzzing and screeching) - Wonder what else this thing does. (dramatic music) (gun firing) - Come on. Hello baby, how you doin'? (groaning) - 'Bout damn time. Jessie, Jessie you took a nursing class, right? Get over here. - Shia, that man tried to kill you. - Just please come over here. - It's not too bad, we can do something about it. - [Shia] Get him something. - What are you do-, what are you doing? (man groaning in pain) - Dude, this might sound crazy but, I know how you feel, what you said. I don't know you but, I need to trust you. She can help you. - Bring this device close to the pyramid. I wanna see what the thing'll do (groaning). - Jessie, get him patched up. (man groaning) - We leave them here, please. They were gonna kill me, what did they do to you? - Those are my guys. Just like us. - [Injured Man] Here. - Legacy initiation protocol 2-A-3-7. (swishing) (chaotic swiping and electronic beeping) - What the hell was that? - [Woman's Voice] Welcome Shia, to Project Legacy. - What the hell? - [Woman's Voice] I am your guide. Where would you like to start? - Who are you? - [Woman's Voice] I am you, your memories, your thoughts, your legacy. I am your past, present and future. The information you need to move forward is programmed within me. - What is my mission then? If you're real, what is my purpose? - [Woman's Voice] To restore order, calm for all, and peace throughout the nations. - And how do you expect me to do that? - [Woman's Voice] By using the history of your future, from your future subconscious, and altering the events to come to create an alternative, peaceful reality. - Shia, I've had enough for today. - Everyone stop. Seriously think about this for one second just, what if, what if this is real? What if what just happened is real? Or for that matter, is going to happen? - Shia. - Put that in place with this for me, I don't know if it's real, let's do it together. Jessie, come on. Am I the only one that believes that just really happened? I mean, there's a device here projecting an image and nobody knows how. Somebody put things together. Like that guy said, haven't we all wanted something to say for ourselves? - We can have that here, not with that. - I don't know what just happened, or how important my life is, but if this is real, then you're gonna need help. I'm gonna be alongside you, man. - I wouldn't wanna do this with anyone else. - Then we're all doing this together, right? We can't let this down. We have to save and help our futures. I don't know what's next. - [Woman's Voice] Shia, put your hand over me. (rapid swishing) (deep tones) - Morning babe, today's the day. - What's going on, Jessica? - Are you okay, Shia? Is there something wrong? - Why are you in bed with me? - Where else am I gonna stay? - What's today? - Oh, oh, you don't have to worry, we have until 6:00 p.m. - What is today's date, Jessica? - [Jessica] Shia, how could you not know this? It's July 4th. - What am I missing? Is there something I need to know? - [Jessica] Shia, you're really scaring me. (water rushing) - [Man] You had a hard fall bud. I don't think I've ever seen someone miss a straight landing. - [Jessica] Shia, are you all right? - Where's Donnie? - You fell, you must still be very dizzy. - No, where's Donnie, Jessica? - Shia, I don't know how to tell you, Donnie's dead. Come on, we have to hurry up. (slow, solemn music) - Facility's downriver, let's go. (quick, adventurous music) - [Man] CCO. (dramatic music) We gotta go now. Facility's this way. We'll meet him here. - Coming soon, just look presentable. (beeping) - [Male Voice] Anything else erupt? - Damn DMCs flew overhead. - [Man] Coming. - Shit, gotta go. - Everything's set up, your marker's in the middle. - You remember what we talked about, right? What is the one thing I told you to remember? - No matter what, - [Both] Anything, and everything. (swishing) - [Jessica] Shia, Shia, come on. - [Donnie] You all right man? Wake up. - Please wake up. Oh thank god, are you all right? - Something happened. - [Jessica] Yeah, you passed out. - [Shia] How long has it been? - [Jessica] About a minute, why, are you all right? - [Donnie] You won't believe this thing. You guys, come along. - [Donnie] For what? - Shia, what are you doing? - I trust it. - To do what? - To use me to rewrite our future.
