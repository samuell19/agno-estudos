GALANTE Cinema Productions & Services presents: A film by CARLOS REICHENBACH I am running late. - Do you need to leave in a hurry? My attorney is waiting for me at the coast. Your husband had a lot of property, Sandra. He had to die for you to find that out. So you get your hands on his money. I need to buy you some things, my little rent boy. Your mother’s a rent boy. If you don’t like it we’ll stop coming here. How about we do it in your mansion? In your mother-in-law’s bedroom? Very funny. This motel is all I can afford. I’m friends with the owner. You’re the capitalist. I’m not so lucky to inherit beach houses. That beach house is no palace. I hear it’s quite shabby even. - Don’t know. I’m going to see it today. Did you really not know he had this house? -I swear I didn’t. Quite a prick that husband of yours was. Without Dr. Carvalho, I would have lost this house. How come? - Invaders. The old man never knew he had an executive for a wife. What do you mean? You managed to get his assets so quickly. This house is the last one to go. Then I’ll sell half of everything and head to the East with you. Don’t count on me. I’m not going to go without that wonder between your legs. Quit that, Sandra. I’m never leaving you, my little man whore. You get so demanding, just because you’re paying for my degree. I do. Am I not the capitalist? Since I’m paying, I want the best. Get out of here. Go get your land back. Go make money for your man. I need a lot of new stuff. EMPIRE OF DESIRE guest actress MARTHA ANDERSON especially featuring ALDINE MULLER Madam, can you give us a ride to town? You’re underage. Me? Yes, ma’am. Everybody asks the same thing. You’re probably wondering if I’m a relative. Yes, I am... -No. We’ve been together for six months. And that’s all. - It’s cool. Are you married? No, ma’am. We’re together and that’s it. You’re probably wondering about my age. I think I’m 33 or 34, I’m not sure. I wasn’t the first to sleep with her. - But you have been the best. What do you do? If I work, whatever is easiest. What we really enjoy is doing nothing. You just want to have fun, right? - Whatever comes our way. Let’s go. Let’s go. Is this good enough for you? It’s paradise. - This is cool. Ma'am, we're kind of broke, can you lend us 300? Lend? - If you can. You’re really shameless. I have to be. - Does it work? Only with nice people like you. - I have no change, take 500. God bless you. Oh, stop that. She turned out to be generous. She can afford to. I thought you were in the mood for her. I wouldn’t want to sleep apart from you. Your client is not very punctual. - Relax, she can do this. She’s loaded. This case is really going to help me out. Don’t whine, Carvalho. You got money. I am using my brains. I got three houses on that beach alone. You can’t complain. You made a lot of money with me. Yeah. Think of how many people I’ve helped in retrieving their assets. Rich people forget they own things here. When these land-grabbers show up, I find the real owners and work for them. Wait here. I’ll go inside for a pee. All right... Good morning, your Honor. Sandra! Nice to see you. I’m late, aren’t I? -Not at all... you’re precisely on time. Please, I’m almost one hour late. It doesn’t matter, the court official has just arrived. And where is he? He went inside to... He went to see the judge. Great, so I can grab a sandwich somewhere. Of course, we have great sandwiches in town. I’m also going to get some smokes. - Brilliant, we have great smokes here. “OWNERSHIP IS STEALING” Barreto, this won’t be cheap. Their relatives live far away from here. That’s okay. The rich woman is paying. What happened to her? She must be depressed. We’re always the ones to do the dirty work. They put their masks on and sleep nicely. No way! Sandra is an exception, she’s nice. Valente is a scumbag. He hires them with small children... just to make our work more difficult. Some people give up, after seeing the children. Be prepared, Valente is setting you up. He’s impossible. Let’s go. Is it over? Almost... What if we gave up now? What? This is worth a fortune! I don’t need it. - This location is highly valued. Don’t get too sentimental. Valente is a crook, and these people are his dummies. I didn’t even know this house existed. - I know. My husband bought it for his orgies. - Yeah, I know. Did you know? - No. I mean, I’ve heard things. You joined in too. Never! I’m a father and happily married. Married does not mean castrated. - Sandra! I’m sorry, Carvalho. I’m very upset. - I know, but cheer up! We need to get a housekeeper urgently. I mean, you need a housekeeper. I think I’ll stay for another day. - Wonderful, we have great hotels! No, I’m staying here. - But there’s nothing here. They’re taking it all away! - We’ll go to town and get supplies. My modest house is open for you! -No. Let’s get going, there’s a lot to do. My wife will be pleased to host you! - Never mind, Carvalho. I’m staying here. That’s insane! None of this was required. You could have stayed at my house. - I only need the sheets now. What is that over there? I hope you didn’t smash it! - Hold on. Hi, ma’am. Do you know where you’re sleeping tonight? -We have sleeping bags. Plebs! Are you going to the beach? - Yes. I was thinking we’d sleep over there. It’s not going to rain. There’s nothing in the house, but if you have sleeping bags... Have you gone mad, Sandra? Inviting a couple of pot heads to stay over? Quit the drama, Carvalho! We need housekeepers. What? How long are you staying around? - About a week or so... By next weekend, I’ll bring a housekeeper from the city. But that’s crazy! - Here’s the deal: I offer a place to stay by the sea, you watch the house until I’m back. Ma'am, we just want to hang around. No fixed place, you see? Told you! These youngsters have no sense! And he’s also ungrateful! Would you still let us stay over tonight... Don’t do this, it’s absurd! These hippies are ruining the country! They should be arrested! You people have to work! Go sleep in the woods! Let’s get in the car. - No way! I’ll give you money to go to a hotel. Here’s the money, you guys. Be reasonable, Sandra, please... - Stop by tomorrow, Carvalho. Let’s go. The house is a bit run down, but it’s a nice place. My husband built a school in the back. Perhaps to seek redemption, from all of those sins behind my back. But it never really worked out. They didn’t take this old stuff. One of the few things Ricardo left here. The deceased? - Yes. So, are you going to help me or not? Finish that for me, dear. I’ll get into something lighter. What is it? You are very pretty. Why don’t we go to the beach? I couldn’t wait until tomorrow. I knew you had forgotten about food. That’s good. What happened? Are those two up to something? - No, of course not. But you're shaking! What's going on? - Have you seen a strange man in white? Oh, the man in white scared you! He’s your neighbor, he lives nearby. He’s a little off, but harmless. He likes to show his junk, excuse my language, that’s all. What a relief! - You’ll get used to him. Let me take this inside. - I’ll do it, don’t worry. No, this is heavy. It’s a man’s job! Let me do it, please. - No, no way! Please, Carvalho, don’t go in there! What in God’s name is this? Do you think this is a whorehouse? This is absurd, I can’t believe my eyes! Even dogs are more discreet! I wish I had a big bucket of boiling water! That’s enough, Carvalho! I knew these indecent people would stain this promontory! What’s a promontory? Who are you to violate this modest shack with such impious acts? What’s a shack, Nick? Get out of here, muddy worms! - That’s enough, Carvalho! I’m closing the door. Go away, please. - Pigs! Go away! They can’t stay here for another minute! How absurd! Will you kick them out? Yes, I will, but not right now. - You must, in the name of morality! Kicking people out more than once in one day is too much. This is unacceptable, they were copulating! That’s ok, that’s ok. - But that’s immoral! It’s immoral that you knew about my husband with many women in there! But that is different! He was a man, he was entitled. Entitled, huh? You know what I meant. I’m talking about the property. No one is kicking anybody out. They are staying. Then I will have to spend the night here! No, no way. You have your family. I’m independent, I take care of myself. What if they decide to violate you? - Don’t be silly, Carvalho! Don’t you want me to stay? - Please, leave. Please go away! We were thinking we should go. - No, you can stay. You know, it’s an awkward situation. All this commotion... - Never mind, it’s ok. Are you alright, ma’am? - Yes, I am. That man was so angry... Said all those weird things... just because we were doing it. It felt so nice... You understood and didn’t say anything. Sir... Sir! That’s for you guys. This is a nice place, isn’t it? - Yeah. Was your husband a musician? A frustrated one. - He was much older than you, wasn’t he? Yes, why? Because of the kind of music he liked. Did you marry him for love? Of course! He probably had a lot of money. You want to know if he was rich when we got married? Yes, but he got much richer afterwards. He had a factory and manufactured giveaways. Giveaways? - What kind? Pencils, key-rings, pens... that kind of crap. Here’s a gift for you. Thank you, but it’s useless to us. I’m going to bed. Would you like anything else to eat? Sandra, do you mind if we do it? Wow, you’ve got some stamina! Just don’t make noise, I’m a light sleeper. What is that tent? I don’t know. As I woke up this morning, I saw this tent in the desert. You woke up inspired, huh? What a night! What a night. I’m going shopping, want to come along? - No, thank you. We’ve decided to accept your offer. We can stay here for a while. That’s great. “UNDERSKIRTS ON BOARD” That’s enough for me, you carry on. Film us, just press the button, do it. My name is Pantha. Princess Pantha. Granddaughter of immigrants, born in Minas Gerais. Former student, foreign relations... And I can also do your horoscope. Read everything by Castañeda. I like modern cinema, can’t stand pop music. The Reich report is my Bible. I’m a free thinker... don’t talk to me about feminism. - Cut! We have an intellectual among us. Are you engaged? Don’t be stupid! Don’t mind my friend, she’s from a small town. I’m not stupid! I’m going to school. She’s the semi-virgin prototype. She was engaged for almost six years. He just led her on and used the back door. She’s jealous because I’m a virgin. I’m never going to have sex out of interest. Maybe gratitude... - You’re a fool. Oh my, it’s so cold. Get your coat. Are there people in the house? I’m really into you. I was a Miss. Miss Inland-State. Won a trip to Foz, have you been there? It’s so beautiful, no one believes it. You look at me and think I’m too skinny. But I’m fake skinny, you know? I was in the Sex & Cinema magazine. But at the time we didn’t show any pubes. Imagine if my father found out! This is it. Take me in your arms. That’s it. It has to be warm and soft, erotic... Slowly rub against me. But don’t get too turned on yet. Kiss my ear. Use your tongue... Your tongue! No need to press that hard, damn it! I want to get all wet... That’s it. I bet you’re dying to take my thong off. Dying to throw me on the floor and forcefully get inside me. Are you psychic? Men really suck! You’re nuts. Touch my breast. May I? - Do it! Grab the other one. Now get them out. Now kiss... slowly. I said kiss, not bite. Roll your tongue around the nipple. Now get my thong off. Slowly... That’s it. Now get your hand on my pussy. Slow. Don’t squeeze too hard. Manipulate it. I can even feel your fingerprints. Wonderful! I’m very sensitive. Look, girl. Your radiation has been reverberating. I’m done. Asshole, cocksucker! Do you think only men should come? I’m so stupid! Gave my ego to a premature ejaculator! Where do I stand, in the spectrum of female weaknesses? I have a surprise for you. I have improved our little house. I’ve tried to make it more humane, livable. I bought paintings, furniture... The truck is old but can take Nick to town. Just in case there’s an emergency. I’m going to the city, but I should be back in a few days. I want to bring my boyfriend here. You will like him. He’s young and cool. If you need anything ask Dr. Carvalho. He’s supposed to come by tomorrow. Goodbye! Is it ok to leave the tent unattended? Those two are in the warm house, while we are out in the cold. We shared our coffee, time to pay back. That’s not it, Pantha. - Of course it is. What happened in here? What’s all this stuff? It looks alright, Pantha. - Crap, all crap! And you... what were you doing? The business, right? So what? You don’t give it a rest. It’s all you think about. Aren’t you too young, to be the submissive woman? You’re there to do whatever he wants. - Of course not! Turn it down! You’re too young to see through their game. Turn that down! I want to listen to music this loud. You have to demand your intimate needs. We can’t talk in here, come with me. How can you put up with her? Pantha? She’s cool, she knows stuff. Because she memorized a couple of books? In the worst kind of way? I wish I had half her courage and wisdom. Wisdom? - Yes, she has an open mind. If she’s into a guy she just goes for it. She has no problem behaving that way. No annoying family like mine. Family, huh? I don’t know... myself. Pantha wanted you and she got you. It didn’t work out, that’s something else. If I wanted that, I wouldn’t have the guts to do it. And do you want that? That’s not the point. Do you want that? - You didn’t understand. Do you? - I do. That’s all I want. But it has to be that way. That way. Pleasing yourself means independence from men. I like the most the vibrator. It sets you free from your partner’s wants. It does require the development of a special technique. That takes some time. There’s guilt afterwards, but it fades away quickly. I loathe the male porno thing, that is the artificial penis. Maybe being a lesbian is a good idea. I have many lesbian friends. Apparently I have no strong inclination... I still hold certain conditioned patterns. Or I am scared I won’t be able to handle it? Do you feel anything, when you see a naked woman? Honestly, I don’t know. What if they touch you? - I don’t know, maybe... You idiot, stupid, imbecile, ignorant! You understood nothing of what I said! I’m not a lesbian! My considerations were not mere proselytism. It’s about the head, the brains. You and your boyfriend are a good couple. You’re both savage primates with no reason! This is the only way for me to handle the desire and remain pure. This sexual revolution thing is made by men. If we don’t give it all, we’re idiotic or prudish. And if we sleep with everybody, we’re sluts. The principles of female liberation are concentrated in the values of men. Why get married if we can sleep with sluts? I don’t fall for it. I only do it like this so I’ll be able to deal with it later. Only I know the torture I endure to remain a virgin. There you go. There’s your Achilles’ heel. The vengeful angel. The freed Jerusalem. The corrupted pole. The tear of the panther. The miss and the dinosaur. Barbaric perverted animal! Impotent idiot! You can only think of one thing. Sex, sex, sex! - Marry me? Marry me please. Sex, sex, sex! - Marry me, please! Savage! Here’s the temple of the murderers! Leave me, I’m a good driver! - You’re an idiot, that’s more like it! Let me drive. - Get your hands off the wheel! Let me drive. Look ahead. Drive carefully, I’m ordering you to! You don’t order, you have to ask. - Look ahead, you’re a terrible driver! I’ll do whatever I want. Get off, I am the driver. As I told you, land is the only thing... My God! Help! They’re Valente’s guys, help! You get in my way! - You can’t drive! Careful! - Mommy! But weren’t we supposed to...? - Behave, this man is a doctor! Am I? -If he’s a doctor, where are his documents? You’re not even working, you fool. This gentleman is the famous Dr. Carvalho, isn't it? I don’t know. I am. Let’s get him. - Shut up, you ignorant man. Here’s the deal, respectable attorney -Now I speak. Dr. Valente wishes to call your atten- tion to the fact that he’s not happy... About your professional interference in his investments. Oh, my children! - In other words, he’s pissed off. He wants you to get rid of the new housekeepers in the widow’s house. Otherwise he’ll file a complaint, as he’s entitled to squatter rights. That means someone is going to have to deal with Mr. Onion. Mr. Onion? Put that away! It’s alright. What’s up, Nick? Is there a problem? I had decided to never do certain things. I suddenly find myself forced to do them. Staying at the same place... getting isolated... And even wanting to drive! Never mind that! Let’s see if the girls need anything. There’s nothing in here. They took everything, leaving only the tent behind. Yeah. Watch out! Things are about to turn bad! Bad guys are coming to kick you out! This is for you to protect the house. If you have to shoot, don’t be scared! I can handle the problem, I’m an attorney! What’s up? Have you been working alright? Is the house clean, the bathroom ok? What about personal hygiene? Have you been washing? Brushing your teeth? Cleaning your nails? What about these dark circles? Have you been eating well? That’s not because of weed, is it? The beast of the apocalypse... Skeleton. Can you believe this crazy man was once really rich? A senior executive. All of a sudden, he started using his money to get poor. Isn’t that absurd? All because of reading. Culture? That’s for queers! He became a poet and lost it all. He has been suicidal, a thief, a priest, a pederast, a hippie, a gypsy a con-artist, a ventriloquist, a black, an Indian... even a labourer! I know him! - Of course you do. He was famous, before going to jail and going crazy. Enrico di Becco? Enrico di Becco? To be you being me. To be you being me. Want to see something funny? Show your poetry to him. Show it. Enrico! Enrico! Stupid coward! Lowlife queer. Just because I made him show his cock to your girl? You’ll see. I hope those guys show up and kick your ass. You both can go to hell. Get stuffed. Pick worms on the pavement. You should be locked up for rest of your lives. I’m calling the police, I’m having you two arrested! I’ll give this back to that crook! “IMPLACABLE PERSECUTION” “SOUVENIRS” This is why I’m proud of being born here. I was a pimp in the Caribbean, didn’t see anything like this. I was a collector, cleaned pits in Hawaii... A garbage man in Cortina d’Ampezzo, a gravedigger in Capri... a sandwich man in Marrakesh and a crook in Acapulco. And I didn’t see anything like this. - But you’re rich now, right baby? Filthy rich! Filthy rich! An expression of real people, love... The plebs! The plebs! All the truth, worthy of a prize! Let’s get straight to it. Anyone home? Wonderful, these trivial dishes! These tropical flavors! Try some. It’s armadillo. I know armadillo meat. They eat better than we do. It’s good stuff. I’m getting beach horny. Did you bring some oil? Let me rub it. Whatever happens... - Why rub oil? It’s not sunny! But it’s sultry weather. You can still get a little tanned. Call me cutie, please? Cutie... Cutie pie... I’ll go crazy this time! Mamma Mia! Kill me now! Mind your cholesterol levels... You'll turn into a pervert. Suppository? Touching her back, it’s all here. This will end up as a 69. It’s all sticky. With your ass up, just waiting for me. My ass is on fire. Women want power! 500 bucks, huh? Don’t try to fool me. Let’s lie down. Lay down here, porn star. It wasn’t my fault, I swear. He is crazy. I like young people. They’re kind of neurotic nowadays. My daughter is about your age. He is doing well. The nurse said his face will heal soon. You’ve been very cool. You even got all dirty with his blood. It doesn’t matter. I’ll have my shirt washed, it’s cheap. You guys probably have it right. Laid back, free love... it’s kind of nice. I enjoyed it. You want to sleep with me, don't you? That's clear. I’ll be back, baby. I’ll even find a woman for your friend. And we’ll have group sex. - Alright, go away. Wake up, it’s four o’clock. You told me I wouldn’t get burnt. - Don’t be annoying. We forgot about our lunch. What do you want? Thigh or chest? - Does that help with the pain? Pirates! Pirates! Gypsies stole my luck! Stop it! Stop it! Crazy bastard! You’re dumb and stupid! Idiot! Prick! What are you planting? I am ready. Put that away! The soil is very important when planting. Some plants like acid soil, rich in humus. You can do that yourself, by mixing common compost with fiber turf. Other plants prefer chalky soil, more porous. Mix the compost with thick sand, ceramic shards, clay powder, loam... Savage! That’s not how you treat plant lovers! I was a farmer before I became a cop! Let me go! We have to do this job. Let’s talk to the crook again. This time, less tactfully. Great! I’ll kick his ass! - Idiot! My ass is burning! It's burning. Baldy needs to man up! Men don’t cry! Sissy! Sissy! Baldy! - You know what? I’ll kick your ass! Watch out! Lie, Pinocchio, lie. Alliteration. The fairy fables! - The fairy fumes? The fairy fucks! - The fairy flies? The fairy farts! - The fairy fakes? The fairy fixes! - The feeble fairy? The famished fairy! - The furious fairy? The fairy freezes! - The fairy fries? The fairy faces! - The fairy farts? The fairy filches! - The fairy fires? The fairy flowers! - The fairy fixes? The fairy fetches! - The fairy falls? “ASHES THAT BURN” Surprise! Where is our big boy? He’s making dinner. Yay! What’s up? This isn’t a man’s job. Tonight we’ll be swapping, big boy. I brought two foxes for you. You are going to love it! The very best from Irene’s house. Wonderful! I bet you’re a great cook. Do you want to try some? - Yes! He’s such a crook, went straight to it. - I went for it right away. Very good! The perfect dish for an orgy. You know, I’ve never been in one. But tonight is the night. I’ll have your girl and you’ll have mine. Did you bring your family? What? Did you bring your wife and daughter? Come on! You’re not legally married to that girl! Look! When are we getting drinks? There you go, girls! Here’s your nectar. Put some music on for us, Lucinha. You must have the dead man’s favorite music. I like it too. Get lost with him. Now, for you, baby. Will this make him happier? Yes, I think so. You don’t mind? The weather is great. What’s up? Are you rejecting me? Do I disgust you? Are you afraid of getting a disease? I see a doctor every week. This is no second grade. It’s classy stuff. Very well handled. I’m not a city whore. I look after myself. That’s not it, lady, it’s in my head. I don’t know the limits between liberty and promiscuity. I’m not as confident as I thought. You have this hippie vibe, but you seem like a cool guy. I like you. Are you related to Carvalho? No... but he looked after me when I crashed my car. So you let him sleep with your girlfriend? I don’t own her. Carvalho is a crook. He paid us to distract you while he... Ok, let it be. Come on, do me. I want it. Come on. I’m sure I’ll come with you. Join them, Mimi. No way. She looked like she wanted him for herself. Go take a walk outside, then. - I don’t feel like it. What is it? Are you trying to get in the way? I’m afraid of the dark. Get out, bitch. I’m paying you. Does it feel good? I’m good at it, right? Say it, say it. Are you happy? Very happy. Apart from the bad sex with my wife... I’ve only ever done this with whores, paying for it. What is it, crazy woman? Oh, it’s you! What a bummer! What do you want? Did you have to scare her just now? That’s unfair! There you go. Yes, shove it up your ass. Get off me! What a great orgy this was! That retard had to show up and ruin it! That song was annoying me! Calm down, he’s here. So, who’s taking care of me? Fuck off! Come on! Come on, baby! Get off me! Idiot! - Bitch! I’m paying! Let’s do it! - Leave me be! Give me some space. - Get off, idiot. Imbecile! Get your hands off! Square idiot! Get off! Stop annoying us! “THE BITTER KISS” I’m sorry. I had the best of intentions. I just wanted to do what you do. OK. Let it go. How can I let it go? I like you guys, I swear. I like young people. They make me feel good. I might be a little square but... - You took care of Nick like a father. Hold on, I’m not that much older than he is. I did it as a friend... because I like you as friends. This man is crazy! I’m not gay, you queer! What are you thinking? I’m a family man. No one can do that to me! My daughter is her age! Damn it! You must respect me! And I was considering being friends with you! All cool! Isn’t this paradise? If you like this kind of place. I could spend the rest of my life here. You’re getting old quickly, Sandra. Little baby... What a pain! If we got married, would you want to live here? My ass is achy from sitting in the car for too long. Let’s see this house! You seem impressed with your housekeepers. There they are. You will like them. - Those two? Hi. - Hi. What happened to your face? - An accident, nothing serious. This is Odilon. - Hi. I’ll show you the house. He is gorgeous. Isn’t it nice? It’s terrible! It had to be your husband’s, the prick. You’re getting really annoying. Hi. There’s a lot of tasty stuff in there. That’s true. She really did bring everything. Leave it on the sink. I’ll make us a delicious lunch. I’ll be the one cooking. - You? He’s really good at it. I like to come up with new dishes. - Mmm... You know what? Nick will be making us lunch. Yes, he seems quite feminine. You should learn some things from him. - Like embroidery, washing, ironing? Don’t you think University is enough? I’m only back to school because of you. Of course! I want a real administrator for my factory. Hey, girl. How old are you? - Seventeen. Damn it, the girl is underage. - What’s the problem? Are your parents alive? Do they know where you are and who you’re living with? That’s enough, Odilon. You take risks, don’t you? Are you married to the girl? - No. You must be over 35. I don’t know. I can’t remember anymore. Good one. These hippies... What kind of housekeepers are these? At the beach instead of working? No, Nick. I’m so happy with you here. I’ve never seen you give so much freedom to the help. They will be bossing you soon. - Don’t be silly. Didn’t I tell you? Who asked you to put music on? Leave the girl alone! Come here, girl. Come over here. I won’t bite. What do you want? - Nothing. You’ve been watching me all day! You’re very good looking. Is that all you have to say? Lucinha is enchanted with your boyfriend. -I could tell. It’s best if they do it already. That’s an easy way to solve things, right? Not easy... rational. Quit that, Nick. Join us. - He doesn’t want to, don’t insist. What is this? That’s not necessary. I feel like being on my own. Don’t be rude, she’s trying to be nice! So, are you picking up the dishes or what? That’s it! I’m the boss here! What are we going to do? Nothing. We’ll just enjoy it. Enjoy what? - Jealously. Enjoy jealously? Yes, isn’t it an emotion? Let’s take it until the end. - I think you’ve gone mad. Things have been on a loop for about a week. I’m having enough of it. I thought I was the square one. Everything is so confused... You know, jealously turns me on. It does the opposite for me. Why don’t we pay back in the same currency? Can’t do it, Sandra... I feel terrible. Self-pitying is low. Calm down. Give it some time. - Why? I don’t feel like it. - How come? Damn it! I just don’t! - Stop that silliness! Nick! Turn around, bitch. Just turn around. Nick! Satisfied, aren’t you? Bunch of repressed people! Barbaric, submissive people! Subservient people! “WIND FROM THE EAST” He never left his board abandoned. - Carvalho? Hi, Sandra! Nice to see you. Have you seen the crazy man, the one in white? No. Strange, we’re also looking for someone. My fiancée. Already? What a coincidence. Let me introduce you to a reporter from... What newspaper again? Prosélitos... The only cultural anchor of anti- revisionism at the bottom of the ocean. Colonial exploitation! Who? - Bezerra! That’s no Bezerra, that’s a fag. The renegade, the fugitive, the Kamikaze! Are you talking about Nick? - Of course not! She wants to interview the man in white. Get in. Let’s search his beach. I’ll come by later to talk to you. I’d like to talk to Nicolau. - You’re wrong. He’s a piece of shit. It’d be another scoop for my publication. Is this man really important? - He was. His shed is over there. I’m not going with you. He’s kind of creepy, doesn’t like visitors. Don’t forget my name in your newspaper. “That’s what he says, but note what he doesn’t say” In my revolutionary experience, I’m best informed when I speak to the people. Workers, students and peasants... I want to drink to our alliance. Shall it never lose its intimacy or even its free exchange of ideas. Human society is an organism, not a mere aggregate of individuals. As an organism, it must function as a unity. Freedom becomes increasingly harder. Explorers will not spontaneously retreat from history. I don’t like dirty anecdotes! Thank you. My only addiction is politics. PARADISE HAS BEEN PLUNDERED DESTRUCTION WILL BE TERRIBLE I WILL COME AND I WILL GO AS A PROPHECY The bourgeois ideology is a fake reflection of a fake reality. MEN ARE WRONG WHENEVER THEY WANT SOMETHING It’s a mistake, to mix up infrastructures with super structures. The state’s power must be the most powerful leverage... to a new order. Movement must always come from the bottom... from the bottom upwards. A spark setting the whole weeding on fire... Essence is phenomenon at rest. The cultural value of a work relies on its abandonment of any content.. And shape from the bourgeois feeling in life. Have you found him? He must have found a girl. It wouldn’t be the first time either. But his clothes are inside. - Clothes I bought for him! I CAME AND I WILL GO AS A PROPHECY Thank you. - No problem. Stay around here, please. The house is yours. Maybe one day I’ll feel ready for it. Living in three is too difficult. I can’t handle it. What is it? - Get off, please. What’s going on? - Dr. Valente wants to speak to you. Lucinha! Nicolau! I’m back! I’m back for good! This is where I belong! I’ve found out I love both of you! I’m in love with both of you! I have found myself. I’m not leaving you ever again. I left my wife, my dog and my children to be with you. We were going swimming, Dr. Carvalho. - Dr. Carvalho, my ass! I belong to you now! Don’t you want to enjoy nature? I do too! Come on. I’m taking you to my spiritual retreat. My little ranch... A place I never took anyone to. Not even my family knows about it. It’s a beautiful place, too beautiful.. I belong to you now. I have found myself in you. I am all in one single moment. I am the man. I am the queer. The big queer! I am everything and nothing. Let’s go. “A PLACE IN THE SUN” It’s beautiful! - What do you think? I told you it was a pleasant place. - Isn’t it dangerous to swim here? I never did, but I’m sure it’s fine. Do you mind if we...? - Of course not, we are one, remember? This is beautiful. Take this. This house belongs to me. Don’t forget. I’m paying you to protect my property. The house is empty, it’s been checked. If that couple shows up, you shoot them! Look how green my valley is! Love wins over everything! Only love builds things! L’amour! Toujours l'amour. Sweet words in the wind! Go ahead, get on with it! It’s beautiful! Beautiful! Can’t do it, we want to be alone. Go ahead! The water is cold! Help! Help! I forgot I can’t swim! Help me, I’m drowning! Come with me, come on. Help! Help me! So much happiness... a film by CARLOS REICHENBACH
