She get you in okay, she'll get you out okay. It's them crackers, shooting at us on the way in... That has got me worried. Shit, we'll shoot back! What am I gonna do? I ain't got no gun! Well, preacher. You just cuss and scream at 'em. What kind of sermon you want me to preach 'em? The blues. Now, we should be starting our running towards that wall, about 2 in the morning. I have no choice, I have to do it. You know, it's... My friends and... and no one else that can do it. About 300 miles to that prison wall. We got to get Randy out before sun up. Slow down, before some cops kick us up. I told ya. I've been in this damn slammer so long. Sometime I forgets. But there's one thing Pappy knows... Is every hole at this prison got to get in and out of. What cracker up there is gonna be sleeping when it's being done. Look, man, I can make it on my own. I don't need no help. I knows that. I very wells know that. But, hell, boy. This nigga ain't been on this side of the wall for 100 years. And what the fuck makes you think I'm not enjoying myself being here?! Well, enjoy yourself, Pops. You never even tell me how Sampson... and the preacher man suspect to get you outta here. You know that cow pasture over there. Sampson and the preacher man are gonna come in here driving at 100 miles an hour. And I'm gonna be somewhere out there, waitin' to meet 'em. While those guards are shootin' into the night, we're gonna be leavin'. You got that, pops? Well, it's... real simple... Direct approach, so to speak. It's a roadblock. They done kicked us out. Get ready to fire some shit. Let me see your license. - What's the rush? - We weren't rushing! What's ya stopping us for? - We's men, you Cracker Barrel cracker! - Paul! We is men! - Listen, Randy. - Yeah. I just remember... I used to know three guys, just like you and your friends. - Come on! - No shit! There weren't any difference. And there was Brother Rabbit. As smart as you are, he was. And he as mean as you is, he is. And Brother Bear... As big as he was, that's how strong he was. Preacher Fox. As wild as he was, that's how wild he was. Oh... Stick it, fuck it, do it, swing it. Oh... Shit that thing, yeah! Oh, yeah... Oh, baby. How you been, daddy? I bet you wondering why I'm here, after such a long spell. Just here to tell you that me, and Bear, and old Fox are leaving. 'Cause they sold our old house. Fox raised us like he promised you and mom he would. But he's still a little shaky now. I ain't shaky! And me and Bear have to take care of him. Or maybe, I is shaky. I did all I could to save the house... but the bank sold it to some fat, city slicker... and he turned it into a pleasure house. Me and the boys are gonna be going back now... To pick up our money from the city slicker and leave. Bear here, feels kinda funny... talking to you, but he sends his love. Fox, too. You take care of mama. We're gonna be going now. Ben, now don't you go believin' that I'm shaky. I still got it, Ben. I don't lie to you, or God. I still take care of Rabbit and Bear, you hear? And I don't want you or mama to worry none... 'Cause old Fox here, he's done gone... - Drop it, Fox! Drop it! - I'm gonna be putting you back now, Ben. Don't you worry about a thing! Oh, I feel our boys are heading for trouble, Ben. I know, mama. I know. It's gonna be up to Rabbit now. Yeah, trouble. Rabbit and the boys went back to the house to pick up their money. They just took too long, fine and blue. Ah, Sheriff. Good idea you heard... finishing our Saturday night with a little black whoring. Yeah... Only thing this nigger's town got to offer is cheap booze and some women. I guess it's about time for me to split this here business. Hey, hey, Fox. You seen Blue? I'ma get our money and leave. No! The last time I seen Blue... He was showing the sheriff's daughter, Marrigold, her room. What?! Sheriff's daughter?! Howdy, boys! Who do I pay around here for my pleasure? Uh, well it's uh... It's on the house. Much obliged, boy. Which one of you fine southern gentlemen is next? - Marrigold?! - Daddy?! Goddamn, Rabbit. I should have known better... Mess you did got us all into. Yeah, Rabbit! Gambling, drinking, fighting. You're not drowning on Sunday! Well, that comes on the Lord's day. Killing crackers, well... I guess that's cool any day. But uh... How the hell did Fox forget to tell me... that Blue had the Sheriff's daughter stashed in one of those rooms? Damn, boy. What'd you expect me to do? Stand there and get killed? With that 'cause Blue owed us some money on the house. Where we gonna spend it anyhow? Yeah! 'Cause there ain't no booze in heaven. Aah! Yeah. Well, boys. We been hustlin' these here Cracker Barrel countries for a long time. And seeing how we worn out our welcome... There's just one place left for us to go. I mean, three guys like us. We got to go with style. Harlem? Harlem! We gonna have open derby twist, pee-hole pluck. Ice hold murder... Yeah! Home to every black man. What?! That's Iceberg Slimin'! Rabbit? Goddamn me. I take back everything I said about you, baby. You're still the head here, we got ya. Praise the Lord! Harlem... Yeah... The pot of smack at the rainbow's end. Brothers and sisters, living on the top of the heap. No more soft shoein', happy actin', back bustin'... Harlem... Harlem... I know I ain't pretty, but that's not why my man left. At leaving, left me alone and lonely. ...Hard to sleep. That's how I meets Malcolm the Cockroach. First time we meets, I chased him all over the place... and try to squash his long legged black ass. But Malcolm, he was cool. Night after night, Malcolm remains cool. After a while... It gets like I miss Malcolm, if he don't show. And when he does, I don't try too hard to hurt him. And he don't try too hard to run. Wasn't long before we stopped fighting. and started talking, and drinking, and partying. Malcolm, he digged Fuente. Malcolm became my friend. Well, how'd you think I felt the night he come by all packed... Leaving... To go downtown. "Ain't it been good together?", says I. "Yeah, woman," says Malcolm. "But hell, I can't do nothing for ya." "It's always cold here, and the few scraps seat at your table... ain't as good as what I find in the garbage downtown." "And there ain't the fear, the whole goddamn building falling down on our heads. Or junkies crushing me on the front." "If I can't do nothing for myself here, what can I do for you?" "Goodbye." Funny thing about Malcolm... He kinda sounded just like my old man, Leroy, sounded the time he left Harlem. And all day, I was drinking and shivering on again. And this here black rat comes hustling across the floor. And looks right to me and says that he heard Malcolm was gone. And winked and kinda grinned, big yellow. Shot him right between the eyes. I don't want to be hurt no more. You know what I mean. Ain't this a bitch? Guys, I guess this is Harlem, man. Yeah. We were really anxious to get here too, weren't we? Hey, what's that old timer doing here? Fuck the white meat. Old Man Bone, that's me. That's okay, I got whitened teeth. I make sure, I don't see them no more. When I walks pass 'em, I keep my eyes to the ground. I ain't seen a white for 100 years. And they ain't see me. I got a beat. Look at all this stuff, White throw out. They don't know, I'm taking it. Hey, lookie here. What'd I tell ya. A natural cotton sweater! A natural cotton sweater! I bet nobody ever think... Blacksmith, shoe shine, Cotton picker, cleanin' floors. Nobody ever think, But never owned a natural cotton sweater. Got whitened teeth, just like I said. Only trouble lately... This load is getting too heavy to tote. I got a while... till I find a place... to lay my burden down. He got excited over a goddamn old sweater. Don't blame him, man. His pappy was a slave. Some brothers got beat up so bad when they were young, But they never come around. Ask Miss America. Hey, honey. It has been good for us. I mean, meaning us. See our relationship has increased a ton-fold these here few years. And I'm so happy and lucky to feel that we has finally getting it together. You know where I'm coming from? So how 'bout Miss America comin' over to my place and let me squeeze your tits? Oh, I should have fucked her when I had the chance. That nigger could be right. What 'chu gonna do, Rabbit? I still want to see what else is happenin' here. Whoa, it's happenin' all in time. I suspect something big is happenin' on the inside. There's gotta be. It's gotta be. Mainly because we're black, it pertains to us. Yeah. What the hell what it is. Let's go in and see, baby. - Evening, brother. - Brother to you too. Say, brother. Uh, like uh... What am I supposed to expect to happen here? Yeah. What's going on in here? Here's where Simple Savior runs his black revolution, brother. That's proof Black Jesus was the revenant's cousin to. He gives people the strength to kill whites. Kill whites, you hear that shit? Any whites? - Yeah, any whites. - Ain't this a bitch. Anyone we want? Ain't this a bitch. - We can kill anyone we want? - Any whites. - I have one special... - Stop it, Fox! Stop it! You mean, we can kill any whites we want to kill? Any whites. Don't mind the cough. Looks like a good crowd out there tonight, huh? It's good, very good crowd, man. It's good, they're ready. Oh, they're ready for their religion, huh? They're ready for... heh heh. Well, you know one thing about my people, they always show up some time. and I'm ready to get out there now. And, how do I look? You look great, you look great. The purple is perfect, perfect! It matches your eyes, Savior. You know, I dance without my robe, you know? I know that, I know that. Well, that's why they came, you know. - You got your act together? - I got everything... - The chains? - Yeah, I got the chains. - Everything is ready? - I got the whips. I got everything. What's going on out there? Well, there's a lot of people roamin' around. We got some strangers coming into town that are there. I don't think there'll be any... That home boys too, that's good.

You know, the gleam. When we hit you with the blue spot. Hey, boy. You got something against the teeth? - There's something wrong with my teeth? - No, I said, they're beautiful! - You look good. - I'm... I'm nervous. - Don't mind me, I'm nervous. - Don't be nervous. Don't be nervous. Told you, no reason to be nervous. - I'm not nervous because... - They're ready for you out there. I know, man. It's the money they got. - That's why I'm nervous. - They have lots of money. - I ain't nervous about the act. - People been lining up since poor people. - But I ain't nervous about the act. - No. Oh, no, the act is great. The act is good. - You got the photographs? - We got the photos. They're ready. They're on the skyline already. I've been preachin' down south... For now, to 30 years. And I ain't never seen no black Jesus! - Me either. - Or even his cousin either. Hey, man. Why you shovin' that picture so tight against? Case, you black, down, old Southerns ever die... You know what to look for. To carry you on home. You all black niggers! Black is tough! Black is together! Black is sweet! Black is sharp! Black is a Cadillac! Black is pigtails! All's black!

And change make that chain over your head. Deliver yourself from the oppressors. For I'm the one they sent here, by gods who deliver you. Deliver you! From the white oppressors!

I ask you all to fill up the baskets that's being passed around. Mighty quick. - Goddamn! - Yeah. I... I has never seen nothing like this before... In my whole life. Not as likely as I can recollectively recall. Nah, that's damn powerful religion. I was wondering where you boys revolutionary donation is at. You boys sure that money is for to kill Whitey. It sure is, brother. Guns, tanks, planes. Even an atom bomb or two. Man, I ain't got no money. Rabbit. Fox. I ain't got no money. Well, I know you ain't lying. We joining your revolution, boys. And with the money that the bear has took, we gonna go buy our own gun. We don't need more guns, now. Look, I sees how them guns are mighty nice. But I hate to let the congregation think that... the boys was being frugal by not buying more. Now, ain't that the truth, brothers and sisters? - Ain't that truth?! - Hell yeah! What's happenin'? I want to know. We need an airplane. Hallelujah! What is it? What's wrong? It's a long, long story, brothers and sisters. The thieves here are kind boys, would love to explain to you... Exactly when the Black Revolution is gonna start. And how they gonna use your money to work for ya. Right on! What about our money? And the same old rip-off. Same thing. - I wanna know... - You supposed to be here for me. You're here for no one, but yourself. That's what you're doing. It's tougher than fighting Miss America without bullshit from my own brothers. - Who is taking advantage of us all. - I'm a living witness. Okay... Okay, you red, white and blue... Now, you no good Miss America! How you like this shit here, huh? - Okay. Okay, you win! - Huh? I winned? I won? Okay, yeah, boy. Hey, put down your gun. You won. And you can take me. Come on, fella. Oh, she got the clap. Savior's revolutionary money bought 'em the biggest nightclub on 125th St. Rabbit thought he should have a few drinks there... On the house. We got the coffee duck. You got the ocean liner with a pee-hole binder. - Hey, Preacher! - Yeah? Why don't you shut up? Because I have an electric mouth. Rabbit, sometimes I misunderstands ya. You know, I mean... What is we doing in Rev. Simple Savior's club? After what's happened at the church tonight. You understand the meaning? Yeah. Well, I'm not sure, Fox. But something's sure gonna happen. Damn, Rabbit. I wish all this talking and screaming about revolution would stop. I'm tired of trying to segregate, integrate and masturbate anymore. - It's hate, too. Take it down a peg. - You don't... Listen, listen! The longer we wait, the longer we gonna end up... Like, like Malcolm and King did. - Uh-huh. Uh-huh. - Hell yeah, I'll drink to that. - Yeah, - Mhm, right on. I'll drink to that too, if one of you boys will buy me one. Look, baby. As slim and trim as you is. The Devlin's on me. You got a lot of nerve, woman. Hanging around with down-home trash here. Your face should be downtown banging in some players. I had no intentions on going downtown anymore. Listen here, woman. You got 10 seconds to make your mind up. Look, I done heard enough, man. And I think I'll say so. That ain't nice. - He's got a cap! - Oh, shit! Let me out of here! - Watch out! - Let me out of here! Oh, let me out of here! It's my duty to escort you home, child. And leave all the un-religious, and disrespectful, unrespectful and up-respectful, down-respectful uh... roughhousing to the boys. You and your friends has cost me and my revolution too much fucking trouble. The trouble with you blacks is, You're too dumb to know when you're in big trouble. I don't want you to talking to him, Savior. Kill him! Don't kill me, Preacher Man. Don't kill me like you've killed my friends. Come on, spare me. 'Cause I'm just a... I'm just a poor country boy. Don't throw my bones over that window ledge. Don't let me hit that cold, hard street below. Please don't throw me out that window. No! Hey, look. I'll be your friend. Please... Please, man. Hey, man, you... You my friend, please. Shoot me, strangle me. Kick me down, ice pick me, do anything you want... But don't let my poor body fling through that open window. And slap down hard on the concrete below. I'm beggin' ya, I beggin' ya. Don't throw me out that window! 'Cause I's born and raised in the garbage can. Follow me, I'll catch his black ass outside. Hey, man. Big... I got big news! Savior got wasted tonight, by a black rabbit. Uh-huh. Funeral's tomorrow. You know where. And that rabbit that done it, is gonna be there. What 'chu doing spreading the news, looking like that? I don't wanna be conspicuous. Brother Rabbit took Simple Savior's funeral... As an opportunity to tell Savior's boys, he was taking over all the rackets. In this groovy graveyard... Beside... the graveyard. Beside the grave... the grave. Uh, uh... What y'all call it? Uh, besides the beer. The beer. Oh, yes. He served good beer. Ah, and uh... Pest is uh... mother. I mean, uh.. Well, I've come right down to the point. We's all black, right? - Let's just leave it here. - [BURP] Yeah, but only some of us don't know it yet. Black racket money stays in Harlem. No more Mafia, police, mayors, senators, judges or presidents. It's our money up here. Let's keep it. Okay, Rabbit. We like it. We like your plan. You killed the Savior. We won't lay a finger on ya, but you still got two big problems. One of them is the cop named Mannigan. The other is a Mafia. They're the same. Kill 'em, we'll join ya. And if you miss, we'll kill you. Okay, Rabbit? Lord, we is getting a day. Yeah... Rabbit's burden was clear. Prove himself. Get the cop, Mannigan. Bag man for the Mafia. Kill him. Then, get the Godfather. Hey, what the fuck... Harder, harder. Faster, faster. Well, if it isn't the head roller of my favorite chick, Manny. My, my. Don't we look seedy tonight. And when Manny get a look seedy and don't wash... That means just one thing. Yeah? Well, what's that, Queen? Means every trouble for those poor unfortunate black studs Uptown. Yeah, I don't wash when I go Uptown. That's for sure. Niggers ain't worth washin' for. Yeah, baby. But I bet you'd wash real clean for me. Kiss this! Don't try that queer crap with me. Eat this! Hey, Mannigan. Hi, boys. Wanna drink before we go? Let's just go and get it over with. - What's the rush? - Plenty! Let's go. So long! Kick some asses. I'm just gonna bring you one, baby. And that one's a rabbit. I'm so happy, I could cry. After 45 years of hustlin' in this here ghetto... Washing dishes, shining shoes, sweeping floors, soaping white asses. Hustlin' never were, then nowhere... I finally made the correct connection. And any pack, repacked, with smack is worth $45. Told you that I don't want no more H pushed around here. Sell it Downtown. 32, all units proceed west on the West Side Highway and tentative... Hey, you should've seen this house I bought in Levy Town. Isn't a nigger around for 40 miles. - Can't bring a new one. - You gotta bet them hole cards. I bet 10 yards. - Get mad... - Hiya, boys. - Goddamn. - Spin it. - Spin it. - Spin it again. - Let it go. - Let it roll. Hiya, boys. How's the fun? Where is it? I ain't got your stash, this month, man. I ain't got it. You're crazy, boy. Think I'm gonna let you run your goddamn Crap games without my cut?! - Your cut's been picked up, man. - Picked up? Brother Rabbit and his friends been here two days ago... with a gun, at least as big as yours, and collected your share. He's holding it, Mannigan. So don't grill up on me, man! He's the cat you want. Come on, Ruby. Keep playing. Always a pleasure to see happy, black folks just enjoying themselves. Kiss my ass, cop. You know what I mean. Sorry, honey. I'm just a good time, honey. And if your muscle ain't around... I just can't see myself arguing with no rabbit and his boys. They done picked up your share, baby. Took some free rides on my girls and lickety-split. Black bullshit! It's all just black bullshit! Come on, Ruby. Let's find that rabbit. He's dead, man. - Hey, it's empty. - Might be some trick. Keep Bobby in the car, watching the front. Tell him to blow anyone coming in or out. - Ruby, you check the roof. - The roof? Alone? Hey, it's so black up there. Who the hell could see anyone? The roof, Ruby! If they're up there, you better see 'em. And if you don't... I'll hear them blowing you apart. Then at least I know where they're at. Fantastic idea. Just fantastic. Good evening, Mr. Mannigan. What brings you to the "Cotton Tail"? Where's the rabbit, bitch? Rabbit? Well, I'm sure he'll be long by and by. And knowing how gracious Rabbit be... You sit anywhere you want. No cover charge, baby. And have a few drinks on the rabbit. Now, you just loosen up, cop. Have your drinks and relax. Your boys got everything covered. Up and out. So as long as you have to wait, might as well be warm. Well, hi there! Jesus! Jesus Christ! Jesus! Damn! Jesus Christ! How... God Damn! Fucking black. The niggers! Alright, we got ya surrounded. Put down your gun and come on out. It's the police here. Damn! They ain't showed yet. Something's got to happen. Sit down here, boy. Don't you leave this wall. They'll pick your ass up, sure as shit. And I ain't never seen no nigger that they picked up... Come back walking, talking, yapping, or breathing. You hear what I say?! Look, I don't care, Pops. If that car don't show soon... Randy's gonna try the only way he knows how and that's by walking. And if that ain't good enough, fuck it! I just have to pay the price. But listen, I haven't finished my story. Yeah... As I was telling ya... Mannigan's own racism finally caught up with him. Rabbit used it to wipe Mannigan out. Now, getting the Godfather was gonna be tougher. But Harlem was still digging Mannigan's death... and started to step out. Ya'll remember when we used to run and fight... for that empty white apartment. Shit! This nigger be sitting at home... hearding some white folks has movin' out... ten blocks away. And I'd run like a hurricane to get there first. By the time, this sucker would get there... There would be 3 million brothers jumping all over the fire escapes. And 3 million more Jews, packing and running the other way. Shit! We all got apartments. We got the whole neighborhood, man. Shit! I'm the minstrel man, the cleaning man, the poor man, the shoe shine man. I'm a nigger man. Watch me dance. Shit! Yeah, I got the devil in me! Been waiting on welfare line, unemployment line, gas line since 9... Now, I'm waiting on the pawn shop line. Hey, I got the devil in me! Been shot on, pushed on, gassed on, passed on. Red, white and blued on. Now, I'm waiting to turn on. Yeah, I got the devil in me! It's the man you see! I'm a natural blackface and up my sleeve, I'm holding an ace... That I won't die in disgrace. If I stop dancing, and don't let you blow me anymore in the wind. 'Cause I refuse to come. Help! Rape! Rape! The Godfather and his family lived in the subway. Why not? Everyone, sooner or later, came to him for something. Shit, the subway made it more convenient. Father, I don't wanna interrupt-a you. But I expects trouble from-a the other families. Father, you gotta excuse me. But they think, you're-a too old to run New York. And they say, that because of the Godfather... Ain't been able to stoppa the black rabbit Uptown. They think you're-a sleeping. Touche. No one's gonna try to bust up-a my famiglia... 'Cause a few black guys. It's only a matter of time, until I... I... zero in on-a Rabbit. Stupid! He got-a no heads! And black people, they don't know what-a they doing. They're all-a stupido. Stupid! Nothing. Nobody. It's-a no wonder they treat 'em like animals. Mario... Stupido. The black people ain't loyal to their own kind. It walk around, all around. Like big, big dummies. No respect. No one-a pays no attention. No one-a cares. No one-a pays any attention. No attention. - Godfather, where are you sons? - [inaudible] Mario! - I can't find 'em anywhere. - What-e Mario? They supposed to be guarding you. My sons are guarding me. I promise you, Mario. Come on, let's you and I have a drink... to the death of the rabbit. Excuse-a me, Father. But I gotta find-a you sons. Crazy! Oh, for days. - Oh, God. - That's it. Don't stop that. Don't... Oh, Jesus! - Don't know if I can take it. - Those-a queer sons of-a bitches. I can't, I can't do anything when you do that. Ohh! Oh, I think I'm... No, I'm not. No, no, no. Not now, not now. No, I'm not ready. I don't think it... Ah. Oh-ah! Not that! - Let me do this again. - Those queer Godfather sons. Oh, God! This time, I'm really gonna do it to ya. I'm not kidding. No giggles, this time. There's nothing wrong with sex, if you don't get excessive with it. Oh, so you brought help. Now, don't you worry. You go right ahead and whip that black slave's ass. And if they wanna get macho... We can show them you can handle it. If it's image they want, well, they've got it. Punch him, go ahead. Go ahead and punch him. Go right ahead and kick him. My brother would give you a kiss of death... on both cheeks, if you had a head. Hey. Now, wait a minute. Let go, let go of me. Come on. Now, wait. Oh, hey pal. Listen. Fellas. Hey, listen fellas. It's gonna be... I promise... I... I'm sorry, I ever did it. I... I know that dad's gonna be mad at me. But I... Look, uh... Come on, fellas. Ah, come on. Have a heart. Shut your stupid mouth! Don't you dare, strike me again or I'll tell papa. If I tell papa what you were doing, he'd break both your arms and legs. So what's wrong with me taking a little kickback, once in a while, on my own? - Hmm? - But not just fucking... - Hmm... - Money, stupid. We take money, not blowjobs. - You do. - The Mafia takes money! Remember us, we're the Mafia! What's papa want with me home tonight? Huh, Sonny? And papa asked all the boys home tonight. I think he's gonna ask one of us to kill the rabbit. A contract?! Oh, I love contracts! Oh, how beauti... Oh, they're so messy and excit... Oh, I wanna do it. Oh, let me do it, Sonny. Please let me do... Let me shoot the rabbit right between the... Shut up, you dolt! One of the tough things though, about being a kid of the God-daddy... Is that it's a tough rep to hafta to measure up to. It's a pain in the ass to me. I mean, all this responsibility... People, let go of me, for Christ's sake and let's talk about this hit. You know, I was just thinking. If you shoot a rabbit's head clean off... The feet just keep on going, down the street. That's the warchild's thing. There's Sonny with Anna Banana. It's always good to see Anna in drag. Ah, Sonny. Boychik. The Godfathers decided. They want you to shoot the rabbit. Me? All these other brothers, why me? - ♫ Sonny's gonna shoot a nigger ♫ - Who knows. ♫ Sonny's gonna shoot a nigger ♫ - Sonny... - He'll yank his eyes and pop off. ♫ Yeah, I wish I were in a land of cotton ♫ ♫ Look away, look away, look away ♫ ♫ Pixie land ♫ Hey, Rabbit! Hey, Rabbit! Greetings from the Mafia! Mama! Take it easy, Bear. I get you a doctor. Lookie here. After you get fixed up... Maybe, you better take a rest. Cut out that revolutionary game. We'll find our old friend, Fox and talk it over with him. Maybe, he can help you make up your mind. Sonny blew the hit and got himself killed. The Godfather still allowed Sonny to be brought home in a box, in style. But he didn't send any flowers. Oh, Sonny's home. Mama! Okay if we take a look? Oh, Sonny's turned into some very hip ashes. Oh, he's a mess, isn't he? Sonny, Sonny. Oh... Sonny, Sonny. Oh... Hey, I thought I told you guys to guard-a the tunnel. Okay. Okay. Just don't get uptight, sweetie. If anyone tries to shoot Papa... Bang bang. I'll blow his eyes out. Yeah, and probably screw him later. You know me. Let's move out! Bear was really hurt. Not so much from the slugs he took... But because he loved Rabbit. But couldn't decide whether to stay and fight with Rabbit or... Try to lead a normal life. He also loved Fox. He decided to try and find Fox, to help him make up his mind. I'm telling ya, times were heavy. Fox, on the other hand, always liked the easy buck. He opened up the biggest house in Harlem. - This yours? - Here, here. Bear! Do you... take uh... this here woman... to be your lawful, wedded wife? - Tomorrow, I'll divorce you both. - "Legal like" - I do. - I do too. I now... pronunceth you... mens and wives. Damn! I should've known better, man. Howdy, husband. Any second. We, we are gonna have-a here. Our first and leak with the rabbit. A toast at the Bauge. Lift at the bear. Niggers, niggers. Fighting in the gutter. Oh, my paisan. Hey, hey. Hey, sit down-a here, Fox. Hey you, stupido. Bring a glass of wine. And there it shall be there, Father. And right on schedule. Your uh... monthly-a share from... haha... My establishmento. You, a keep-a this month's kickback. We, we don't take-a money. What for? Why are we giving that skinny sucker back money? Why?! I'm sick and tired of giving up everything we got in Harlem. How come the Father be so generous? - I need a favor. - What'd I have to do? - I... wanna meet-a the rabbit. - What for? Eh, it's-a business. Sorry, Father. But there is no way I can get within two feet of Rabbit. Cops, I ain't trusted no more. But... I have an idea. Oh, haha. Oh, Fox. I knew you would. I could deliver Bear and Bear could deliver Rabbit. If you'll handle Bear, correctly. Salute! Hey, that's all, Fox. I just sold Bear out to the Mafia. The Godfather's gonna make him the heavyweight champion. Oh, Pop. So much, you worry. Still, you are such a handsome man. Come-a dance with Mama. I carry your problems. Come-a dance with-a Mama! You're still such a handsome man. Dance with Mama, like the good old days. - I wanna Papa to be happy again. - Happy, happy. I wanna Papa to smile. So much, Mama and Papa used to love each other, huh. You are the father of my children. They respect you because you so brave. They love you because you is so powerful. We both love Sonny. Sonny's death has got to be the last son of ours who dies. I love you, Papa. As I always have. But you gonna kill all my sons, you no should live. All of my sons are gonna die, so you can get fat. Oh my God, I found you. With Mannigan and Sonny killed, The Godfather knew there was no way he was gonna get... Brother Rabbit as long as he stayed in Harlem. So he had to pick out some way to get Brother Rabbit out. Fox was the answer. And Bear was gonna be the setup. With Bear set up... The Godfather knew that Brother Rabbit wouldn't be too far behind. - ...Far-fetched. - Sure, we get a waterbed. Is there any place with a waterbed in town? Damn, Fox. What are we doing down here, you crazy... Cool it, Bear. Cool it. Just cool it, cool it. Please. This here is my... business friends. So... so they got to be friends of yours, too. Uh, Mario! I'd like for you, uh... to uh, meet Pearl and uh, Bear. Pleasure is all-a mine. Good evening, Miss-a Pearl. Pleasure-a meeting you, Bear. Heard lot of good things about you. What's come over you, Fox?! Let's party elsewhere, goddamn it! Fox's your friend, right? Yeah, so what? Well, sugar. Fox has been taking care of us, a long time. And it's only right that iffen he wants to party here. We can't be jive-assin' him elsewhere. Relax, sugar! The music... Well, it's not bad. The food looks good. Come on, baby. Just... just... just with me, tonight. Okay, let's dance. You know, it was really nice to meet you. You really look terrific, doesn't she? You know, not only do you look terrific, but you dance terrifically. I mean, Herbert thinks you dance terrifically but... Yes, you dance terrifically. He's too embarassed. Well... You know, the funny thing is that... We've always talked about having black people. - And the club... - Yes, it's finally.... It's very nice to have... But I mean, now that you're really... - Here and everything it's just... - Black people in clubs. incredible, isn't it? - I mean, tell her! - Yes, it's incredible. It's so great... and the things you wearing and everything, and all the colors. I mean, we always have to wear the same old things. - From our parents and... - Yeah, time after time... - everything like that. - It's the same old thing. And we always complain about how we like to be different, but... You... I mean, you guys really do it, you know? - I mean, don't they? - Yeah. No, they've done it. That you've done it. Yes, it's different. - I mean... - Look here. Did you look at that Pearl?! Huh?! Look at that Pearl! I ain't nevus... never!... seen her so happy. That's right. Now listen, Bear. Why don't you marry Pearl, for real? Settle down. Get out of the rackets. Live an honest, God-fearing life. Eh, Fox. It sounds right, but... What else can I do? Be... a professional fighter. Excuse-a me... I couldn't-a help overhearing, but Fox is right. Stay out of my black life or this truce'll end, right here. Who are you kidding-a, Bear. Any man in the world would jump at-a chance to make the kind of money you could. What-a makes you so special? Thinks you're gonna save your race, all by yourself?
