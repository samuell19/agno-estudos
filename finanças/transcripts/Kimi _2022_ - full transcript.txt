Tell our viewers what the main difference is, in your mind between Kimi and products like Siri or Alexa. Well, Sharon, I will tell you the difference between Kimi and those other products you mention by name. People. It's our people and their level of excellence that sets us apart. The voice interpolation on Kimi is a perfect example. We don't have an algorithm trying to figure out what you said or what you meant. We have actual people analyzing Kimi requests so we can continually update our understanding of how you communicate, who you are, what you want. So you're listening to everything? No. Not at all. We are flagging miscommunication so Kimi can better understand you. And we do this every day. Think of it this way. Kimi understands you better today than it did yesterday because of our people. Is that efficient? It's actually the fastest way to get better fast, if that makes any sense. The bottom line is, it's working. You pushed for the Amygdala Corporation to go public, the idea, the timing, mostly yours. How are you feeling? I feel great. I've been saying since I was brought in two years ago, Kimi is the future of this company. It just seemed obvious to me, and the board agrees. But talk to me in a week, after the IPO, if you'll give me the time. I absolutely will. Bradley Hasling, CEO of the Amygdala Corporation, thank you for joining us. We know it's early there in Seattle. Oh, Jess. I was up. I forgot you had Sharon. - Is he awake? - No. I'll do it. Did she ask you how much you would pocket? Oh, she knows I wouldn't answer that. Where'd they set the share price? Twenty-eight? Thirty-one. Which would put us north of... I can't count that high. Yes? You can transfer the second payment now. Jesus. Okay. And no chance of discovery? Of her? No. You there? You'll have it within the hour. - Kimi. - I'm here! What time is it? It's 7:26 a.m., Pacific Daylight Time. You're gonna be late. Well, today will be the sixth consecutive day of protests over the city's so-called Homeless Safe Zones. The demonstrations and counter-demonstrations were centered in the downtown area near official buildings... - Kimi. - I'm here! Mute TV, play "Oxytocin." - Kimi? - I'm here! Open yesterday's stream on desktop. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hello? Marcos, it's Angela. I thought we had an agreement. I know, but I got the carpet guy coming, and the tackless strip went down all wrong. I just need a couple of hours. I get it, I have deadlines too, which is why we agreed 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, 10:00 to 5:00 on Saturdays, and never on Sundays. - Please don't do that. - Do what? Say the same thing over and over again until I can't take it anymore and I give up. All I'm doing is reminding you that you said 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, - 10:00 to 5:00 on Saturdays, and never on... - Okay! Okay, okay. Hold the work, guys. Try a wide putty knife to get the strips up, and don't use a nail gun next time. Whoa, what are you, in the business? My dad was. He did my place. Maybe I should talk to him. You can't. Just let me know whenever you're gonna go out, will you? Yep. Thanks. Bye. - Kimi. - I'm here! Put more kitchen paper in the cart for next time. One possibility is Green Kitchen, on Decatur Street. No! I need more kitchen paper. - Kimi. - I'm here! Play "Me," Taylor Swift. Creating personalized station of Taylor Swift songs. No! I just want to hear "Me!" I'm listening. - Play... - Tell me what's on your mind. - Hey, Kimi. - I'm here! You're a peckerwood. I don't know what you mean by "You're a peckerwood." It means you're a big wooden dick. - Hi, sweetie. - Hi. Do you have time to talk? Um, a little. What's wrong? What? Nothing. I don't know, nothing. I... Is there something specific? No. I'm sorry I bothered you. God. Okay. Can we start over? Good morning, my darling. So, you know the guy from across the street? Yes. I'm not sure I approve of you waving in the window like a hooker in Amsterdam, but, uh, I know who you mean. Mom, it was lockdown. Everyone was in the window. What about the guy? I asked him to meet me for breakfast. Out? - Good! - No. I didn't... I didn't go, but I tried. I don't know what you want me to say, other than the things I always say. I don't want you to say anything. I don't... Did you try that Turn2Me group? Okay. - The Zoom one? - Yes. - Roman read about. - I know the one. Please stop. Oh, God. I would love to. Okay. Bye, Mom. Angela? Angela? Hello? Do you hear me, Angela? Yeah. - Did you find it? - Yeah! The black sigma repeater with the six inputs! Yeah? No, yeah, I know, but I think I had a bad cable too. Ah, okay. - All right, rebooting now. - Okay. Thanks, Darius. Anything for you, Hotness. You can't say that shit anymore, Darius. Ah, this is Romania. MeToo is like 50 years away. Stay on, let's have a drink. Isn't it like 6:00 in the morning for you? Oh, is it? I didn't notice. Thanks for the help. Please don't leave me. No! Don't... I'm here to install the cable. You didn't buzz downstairs. - Somebody was coming out. - You're still supposed to buzz. But if somebody's coming out and you know I'm on my way, then why... - You have to buzz. - Okay. Okay. Sorry. Now what? Yeah. - Yes. - Oof. I lied. I actually don't work for the cable company. - Oh, great. - Sorry. As long as you don't work in the D.A.'s office. Um... Or for the... Oh, go on with that shit. When were you at the waterfront? What are you looking at? Your Instagram. You ate at The Pink Door? No. You wrote here you did. I just liked the picture. Why would you write, "Oh, my God, so delicious," if you've never been there before? You know that spot used to be Arturo's? - No. - With the red awning. It's just right across the street from the old guitar store. Vaguely. Yeah. - It's a Thai place now. - Is it good? I don't know, they don't do takeout. Sickos. The guy in the lobby said it's the best Thai food he ever had. Why can't things just be good? Why do things always have to be "the best." I thought I'd try it. "This is the best Mobil QuickMart on the entire West Coast of the United States." I'm just throwing it out there. Look, we could go right at 6:00, as soon as they open, before anybody's there. It would just be me and you. The server ain't even came in yet. We could yell our order straight to the cook. Never mind. I'm sorry. You promised you wouldn't do that. I know, but you were trying this morning with the food truck. I brought that up, that was my suggestion, on my terms. Okay, okay. Look, I don't know how much longer I can... I didn't get through my streams. I have work tonight. Exhausting. - Kimi. - I'm here! Open next stream on desktop. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. - Stop it. - Shut your mouth, bitch. Oh... Ah! Fuck. Can you turn a little left, please? Toward the light? Mmm-hmm. Okay, using your pinky finger, can you feel along the outer ridge of the gum line? Yeah. Okay, now feel that same ridge, but on the other side, for the right molar. Okay. Do you notice any difference? Yeah, the left one's swollen. Soft or hard tissue? Hard. You need to come in. Angela, your gum is swollen and inflamed with red streaks. You may have an abscess. Can't you just call in an antibiotic? I could, but it'll come back. We need to do a root canal. I take perfect care of my teeth. You grind. You cracked it. It happens. I take perfect care of my teeth so that I don't need to come in. I understand. I thought things had improved for you in this... in this area. Yeah. Well, COVID was a little bit of a setback. So... I... I understand that. And I know this is difficult for you. You don't know. No, I guess I don't know. What I do know is that an abscessed tooth is a magic carpet for bacteria to enter the bloodstream and go to your brain. Please just call in the prescription to the regular place. And maybe some painkillers, okay? I'm not prescribing opiates for a toothache you're perfectly capable of treating. I am not capable of treating it and you know it. I can't come to you. I would need too much equipment. Please just call it in. The antibiotic only. But you're making a mistake. Yeah, okay. Thanks. Why would you send me that stream? I have told everybody not to send me things like that. And especially a week before the IPO. I thought it might have been a crime. Delete it. Did you hear me? I thought it might have been a crime. Yeah, the devices pick up things. Lots of things. And our policy is it's not our business. Aren't we legally obligated? Because of the Amazon Arkansas thing? Do you know how long that court case was? That was two years. And that was a murder. Trust me, Angela, we do not want our own Arkansas. I think this might have been sexual assault. Don't... No. Don't say that. You don't know that. It was an argument. I have a very strong feeling. Based on what? Based on my very strong feeling. Okay. Just skip this one. I can't do that. I clear my list. I always clear my list. Yes, I know that, and it's one of the things that I like best about you. So here's what you do. You just mark this degraded audio and delete it, and then you'll be clear. Will you please, please shut up? I am trying to work! What if this woman needs help? We have no idea who she is. I have the stream number. Yeah, but those are randomly assigned. She's totally anonymous, that's the whole point. Why did I only get a partial? There was no wake word. How did the Kimi unit turn on? I'm here! Kimi, turn off. Okay, what about the device number? Can we access the user account from that? No. I don't have access to those accounts. Who does? - Mrs. Chowdhury might. - Who? Natalie Chowdhury, she's the head of Organic Interpolation. She's in Seattle, in a, uh, tech hub someplace. Okay. What's her email? Don't email, you infant. Call her. Okay, what's her number? Listen, don't email anybody about this. I'm telling you, you do not want the aggravation. They hate this kind of thing. What is her number? I don't know. Look it up in the company directory. And, hey, don't send me anything like this ever again. Please. Hey, you guys, I swear to God! You are driving me insane! I am going to take everything you love and put it in a garbage bag! - Organics. - Hi, may I sp... Is this the number for Ms. Chowdhury? Ms. Chowdhury's not in just now. May I take a message? Yes, my name is Angela Childs. I'm a voice stream interpreter. And I believe I may have heard a crime on one of the streams. I see. Amygdala takes evidence of wrongdoing very seriously, Ms. Childs. If you could please write a detailed summary and email it to Ms. Chowdhury, she will return your call by the end of day. Uh, I'd rather just tell her about it. Amygdala takes this very seriously, Ms. Childs, and we do ask that you start with a written report. - Organics. - Hello, this is Angela Childs. I was just wondering if Ms. Chowdhury was in yet? Ms. Chowdhury's not in just now. Did you send the report? No, not yet, but I will. Do you have any sense of when she'll be back? Hello again, this is Angela Childs calling. I was wondering... Yes, Ms. Childs, I recognized the number. I'm afraid she's still not free. It might be easier if you just came in. You're in Seattle, I see? Yes. Fine, just come down to the office in about an hour. Bring the recording, and if she isn't available, I'll... I can't come there. May I ask why not? Yes, because it's not convenient. But you can tell her that I will be available all day. Okay? Okay, Ms. Childs, I will do. Thank you. Hey. Hey, Prosecutor, what you doing? I can't really talk right now. Make it fast. What's up? Okay, sorry. Um, I just had a quick question. Um, if I heard a crime on one of the streams, who do I tell? FBI. The Internet is interstate. What'd you hear? I'll, um, I'll tell you later... When you come over? Maybe around 8:00-ish? I don't know. I'll text you. Okay. Hey, Hotness! Seriously, Darius, they will fire you for that. I invite them to fuck off! - Are you drunk? - Yes. What do you want? What's a freq tab D 26, 26 request? Why? It was on a stream yesterday. Ah! A freq tab means a Kimi unit's been tabbed... - I'm here! - Kimi, turn off! for frequent interpolation and interpretation. D 26, 26 means it's not the algorithm picking it, it's the code of the person requesting it. Why? - How do I find out who requested it? - You can't. - Can you? - Maybe. I don't know. I've never tried. I'd need the device number. Just sent it to you. But you can't access the user data with the device number. Of course you can. Who says you can't? - Someone at corporate. - Well, they lied. If you have the device number and the admin code, you can hear every recording that Kimi's ever made... - I'm here! - ...if you want. Kimi, turn the fuck off! Do you have an admin code? Yes, but I'm not gonna give you mine. You'd need a dummy code. - Will you make me one? - Why the fuck would I do that? You know, you only ever call me when you need a favor. And your Instagram is bullshit, by the way. I data scraped. It's full of reposts and lies. I don't even know who you are, really. Ah! Who makes fake life online, huh? Literally everyone. Can you make me a dummy admin code, please? Why should I? - Because I heard something bad. - You hear lots bad. No, not like this. And, trust me, I know bad. I used to moderate for Facebook. Shit. I gotta go. Send me the code? This is last favor, fake Hotness. You're too weird, even for me. Thanks. Bye. Hi. Where are you? We had a session starting 20 minutes ago. I am... Something came up at work that I, uh... Angela? Yeah. That I, uh, just got a little wrapped up in. "Wrapped up?" What do you mean, wrapped up? I just, um, couldn't stop thinking about it. Angela? What are you doing? This is rude. Yeah, sorry. I'm sorry. Uh, I was just looking at the... the thing. Some new data has come to light. Okay. This is the sort of thing we've wanted to leave behind, isn't it? Thinking about something to the exclusion of all else, even when you've been asked to stop? Like the virus, like Evergreen... Wow! Wow, just leaping in with both feet today, huh? What is this work thing? Why pursue this? I heard something and I... I think a woman might need help. Maybe she does. Or maybe you've just replaced your real stresses with this. Do you think it's time to talk about it? - About what? - What happened to you at Evergreen. How long you're going to let it color the rest of your life. Yeah. Yeah. I think you're right. And at what point are you going to say "Enough. My life starts now?" Yep. Yep. You are... You're 100% right, Dr. Burns. Thank you. Thank you. And I'm realizing the thing that I really want to be able to do is, like... - Kimi. - I'm here! Call Brad mobile. - Kimi. - I'm here! Play "Oxytocin" by Billie Eilish. - Kimi. - I'm here! Call Brad mobile. - Kimi. - I'm here! Open recording. You have to fucking stop this. You know what you did. You don't know what you're talking about. I don't know what I'm talking about? - It wasn't like that. - Admit what you did. I thought it was a fucking game. Bullshit! You raped me. You're insane. I... I don't know what you want. I want people to know who you really are. I want them to know you're a rapist! Stop it! And stop calling my house. No, Brad. No. I won't be discarded. This is over. Oh, no, it isn't. I know things, Brad. You should stop talking right now. People need to know about your shitty product. They should know anybody can hack into it any time they want. Say goodbye to your $100 million. You're sick. Get some help. - Admit what you did! - Don't you fucking touch me! You... You ever come to my house again, I'll... What? What are you gonna do? I'm not fucking around anymore! Stop it! Stop it now. No, Brad! No, Brad! No, Brad! No, Brad! No! - Kimi. - I'm here! Turn off. - Kimi. - I'm here! Open recording. What... Oh, my... No! Over there. Over there. Lay her down. That's it. Over there. On the ground. - Watch the spray. - Yep. That's it. Hello? May I speak to Ms. Childs, please? This is she. It's Natalie Chowdhury, returning your call. Are you there? Yes. Yes, I'm here. As I said, it's Natalie Chowdhury, from Amygdala. You called me earlier about, uh, a data stream? - Several times, I see. - Yes. Yes, I've heard something. I've heard something disturbing. I see. Well, um... I am sorry to say that this does come up from time to time. And it is not something I take lightly. You've called exactly the right person. I... I'll tell you what let's do. Let's definitely call the FBI as soon as possible. I'm clearing my schedule for the rest of the day. Close your files, come to my office, and we'll listen to the recordings together. We can be joined by a third party and you can select from anyone on my staff. Then we'll notify the authorities officially. Together. When they come, we'll play everything for them here. Does that sound good? I'm leaving now. Hey. Hey! 4F? Angela? Yeah, that's lateral thinking. No, that's Caracas. Mmm-hmm. Blocked. Mmm-hmm. September. Everybody keep going. I'll jump back on in five. This was not our agreement. No choice. Why not? Your friend... Did you give her a Kimi? Holy shit. Unbelievable. She got unpredictable. Threatening. I was just keeping an eye on things. Well, so was she. I don't understand how... Tech worker got an algo prompt. She's on her way to see Chowdhury. What now? How much more cash can you get? Remove eyeglasses and lean into scanner. Oh, I never, um... Remove eye glasses and lean into scanner. Hello? Hello? Please use this card to access floor three. Excuse me. Ms. Chowdhury's office? - Um, at the end of the hall to the left. - Thanks. Hi. I'm here to see Ms. Chowdhury. Ms. Childs. Yes, she's expecting you. Can I get you anything? Are you all right? - Everything's good. Ms. Childs. - Hi. - Hey, come on in. - I'm fine. - Have a seat. - Thank you. Wow, that is one hell of a story. I just... - Oh! - Yeah, I thought so too. Oh! I'm with you, you know. - Okay. - Okay. Can I hear the streams, then? Oh... Right now? Well, yes. Oh. I... I, um... Sorry, I thought... I thought that you said we would do it in the... In the presence of the FBI? That's not exactly what I said, but I have to know what we're dealing with. We're dealing with what sounds like a premeditated murder. How do I know that? Because I just told you. Twice now. - Okay, Angela. - Yeah? How about you give me the device and number, and I can pull the data myself? Can we please just call the FBI first? - Angela. - Yeah? I understand that you have taken some mental health leave in the past. W... why is that in my file? Well, it's just to say that I understand that... You understand what? Well, not the specifics of your case. - I mean, I would never... - I was assaulted. I... I was assaulted... And... and the police put me on trial instead of him. Wow. That's awful. And under those circumstances, I certainly understand your reluctance. Are your parents with us, Angela? My mother is. My father died not long before the incident. I cannot imagine how that... I never gave you guys a retinal scan. Sorry? Downstairs. There was a retinal scanner at the door and it let me in, but I never sat for a scan. Well, we take them off the video conferences. It's faster. - But I didn't give permission. - Sure you did. It's in the terms and conditions of the conference software. Nobody reads those. Angela... What are we doing here? We're waiting for you to call the FBI? You're right. You're right. It'll take me two minutes. I... Okay, I have to get Mr. Cole on the line. Um... Make yourself comfortable. And, Angela... You're a very strong, brave woman. No one's ever accused me of that before. Well, it's true. You hang tight. Hey, I am gonna get Cole on the line... If he calls me before I find him, just... Excuse me. Do you have a bathroom I can use? It's in the hallway. Past the elevators. Phew. Shit. That way. Hey, you've reached Terry Hughes. Sorry, I can't come to the phone right now. This is Dr. Sarah Burns. I'm away from the phone or in a session right now. That envelope looks thin. It's a Coinbase login. Better be enough. It's everything I have left. We are contained and clean at a corporate level. But the tech worker's in the open. You said you had her. They did. But now they don't. What the fuck, Rivas? I can handle it. I'll use Yuri. But Yuri's expensive. So... This is... This is happening too fast. I know, right? Crazy times. The world these days. I mean, it bums me out, to be honest. Relax. In a week you'll be rich. Don't ever contact me again. Forget how to use a rerouter? I need a moving packet location in real-time. - Just use Spyic. - Didn't work. - This an amateur? - She works in tech. So she has TrakBlok. Why do you think I called you? I like her. $50,000 if I'm always live. That's usurious. No, it is not. I'm not charging interest. It's excessive, is what you mean. Fine. Fifty. Number? U.S. 206-134-0970. Don't go anywhere. You still there? Where the fuck else would I be, Yuri? She's moving south on Fifth, towards Union. You better hurry. She's walking fast. What the hell? Oh, fuck me. No, no, no, fuck you. Stop the sweep! Stop the sweep! - Charlie! Charlie! - Go! Go! Go! - No perimeter! - Go! Help! Help! Homes, not jails! Homes, not jails! God damn it, she's gone. Fucking gone. Relax. Yuri? You still there? Where the fuck is she, Yuri? Question is not where she is. It's where she's going. I don't know. I couldn't see. Maybe she went north. It's a fucking mob of people. Fucking assholes, man. They've got nothing better to do. What the fuck is wrong with people? Everybody in everybody else's business. Que molestia. Are we going to go for at least martinis? Who's buying this time? - No, you. - Oh, why? You got the bonus. You got the bonus. From, uh... from work. There you are! Ow! I told you to wait for us. - Oh! Don't fall. - Don't worry, I got you! - What... - Shut up. She's still out. Where else can we do it? What? Like, in public? Sure. She never goes out, now they're gonna find her on the street? Mugging. Bleeds out. Happens all the time. He said at home. What? A break-in? - Why not? - I just don't like it. You don't have to. What did she do? - Don't start. - What, you never wonder? - Please. - Yeah... This is it. Pull over. Got her keys? Set? Wait for these two. Come on. Get her arm. You got her? Fuck. - You got her? - I got her. Hurry up. Jesus, it's like a fucking janitor's keys. Come on. It'll be great. - Angela! - Incoming. Angela! Hey! How's it going? Oh! You don't look so good, girl. What's she been doing, you guys? She had a little relapse. But we got her. - Oh, yeah? That's it, huh? - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah, is that right? Good. - Yeah, yeah. He's got her. - Dude, what's going on? - Help. Run! Run! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Not a sound. The couch. Here. Hold that there tight, okay? Thank you. I've seen you. Yeah. Yeah, I... I... I live over there. How did you know my name? It's, um... You know. It's... it's on your... it's on your buzzer. Not my first name. I searched your address records. It wasn't hard. You're like me. You never go out. That's how I knew that you were in trouble. Serves me right. Is this the only copy? - Well, I... - No. Okay. The files on there were dumped from somewhere. Where did you get them from? Doesn't matter. I emailed it to everyone I know this morning. You sent it to exactly no one. I went through your email. Where did you get them from? Who is it on the recording? Does it matter? Where did you copy that from? Toothache? Ooh. Where did you get it from? No. No. No. No. No, no, no, stop. Why would you? Don't. Get your fucking hands away from there. Laptop. Do you hear her? What? What? Say what now? Laptop. Huh. Watch them. You'll need the password. Oh, thank you. We have all that. Thank you. - That's it? - Yeah. Check her downloads. - Got it. - Okay. Leave it. Leave it. Leave it. - Kimi! - I'm here! Answer FaceTime on laptop. Angela? What the... Kimi! Bedtime lights! Kimi! Play "Sabotage"! Kimi! Max volume! Forget about her. I got the drive. Let's just go. What the... Ah. What the fuck's going on? I just got stabbed, asshole! Ah... - Kimi. - I'm here! Turn the lights on, please. Hmm. Ooh. - Can you hold that there tight? - Mmm. Coming! Hey, what's your name? I'm Kevin. Thanks, Kevin. Any... Any time. - Kimi. - I'm here! Call 9-1-1. I know. Sorry, but somebody was coming up... 9-1-1, what's your emergency? My name is Angela Childs. I'd like to report a break-in at 1-8-5-5 Stacy Street, apartment 4F. There's a person here who's been stabbed and needs medical attention, and there's also, um... Three dead bodies. Hi.
