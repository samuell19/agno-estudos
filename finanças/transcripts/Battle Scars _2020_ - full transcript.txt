War... is Hell. They teach you about war train you to fight how to use a weapon how to kill. What you don't know how to do, is how to come home. How do you train for peace? Peace is Hell for a soldier. When I was young, I grew up on a good street, in a good neighborhood, with good friends, living the good life. Everything was good, and clean, and clear. Boy, I was lucky. So how was your day, Mikey? I was down by the old factory. What were you doing down by the factory? Tommy and Vinny. Yeah, you know I don't like ya hanging around those two. - You always come back a mess. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, well I'm serious, Mikey. I don't want you playing around the factory. It's dangerous. It's okay, it's okay, come here. I want you to have something Mikey, okay? Something that's very dear to my heart. My mother gave this to me when I was just a little girl. You've seen me with it, right? - Yeah. - Yeah? She said that if I was ever lost or scared that this would lead me back home. And now, I want you to have it. Okay? So I want you to promise me that if you ever feel alone that you're just going to take out this compass and know that I'm always with you, okay? - Yeah. - Okay. All right. I love you. Come here. I love you, too. School was out, and freedom was upon us. I never thought in a million years that this would ever happen to me. Talk about luck. Hey you. Hey, beautiful. Miss me? Ummmm... 'Course I did. So what are we doing tonight? I don't know. I gotta talk to the guys. The guys? I swear. It's like you're all married. We are all married. We're gonna get a big house, we're gonna have a bunch of wives, a bunch of kids. Ha ha. Okay. Just be ready for tonight, okay? I gotta go right now though, I'm sorry, baby. Why?

Hello, Mickey. - Good, how you doing? - I'm all right. He was in the car giving her a little one, two. Where were you? I was, uh, I was busy... doing something important. He was taking care of some business. Taking care of some business. What's... What's the lucky guy? Better stop going out with guys on dates. You guys want the usual? - Yeah, that'd be great. - Yeah, yeah, that's good. What about you, Vinny? You're looking a little glum today, sweetie. Yeah, what's wrong with him? I'll have the same. Thank you. I'll be right back with your order. Thank you. Look at this guy. Behave yourself. Forget about it. I think, uh... I think I'm gonna pop the question tonight. Whoa! Whoa. This guy. You're gonna pop the quest-really? Yeah. Congratulations, Mickey. Thank you. Yes, congratulations. - God bless you. - on your death. God bless you and her, yeah. Thank you. What the hell's the matter with you? Yeah, you gonna see Susan tonight? Hey, Vinny, snap out of it! See that look? You gotta watch out for that. Oh, what, is he gonna kiss me? Maybe. But Susan, Susan? Yeah, I'm seeing her tonight. And? I don't know. We just haven't, um... What? Speak up, speak up. This guy- - Guys, guys. - You know, you know... spit it out, Vinny. We haven't, yeah, we haven't... Come on, give it to me. Come on, give it up. Do me a favor, keep it down. I'm learning so much about you, Vincent. I've never seen it before. Didn't I tell you that? Have you ever touched it? - I've touched it, yes. - Have you ever seen the thing? You're lying to me. You have never even touched a pussy. No, I-I've seen... I've seen glimpses of it. I knew it, I knew it. Remember I told you, Hey! Hey! - No, don't. Don't. - What?! - don't, don't, don't... - We gotta tell you something. Honey, can't you see I'm working here? This guy here, can you believe it? He's been with this girl for God knows how long and he's a virgin. He hasn't sealed the deal. I want to tell you, sweetheart, you look really nice today. Thanks, honey. Aw, virgins are kinda cute to me. Oh, really? Well then you are in luck 'cause we have one right here. If, uh, things don't work out with yous... you can always date me, doll. Just let me know, capiche? I think our friend Vincent over here just went in his pants. What's the hell's the matter with you? It's got nothing to do with her, man. You'll take care of business tonight, Vinny. Eventually some girl is gonna wanna sleep with you. - Yeah, don't worry. - It's not that, guys. It's not that, what is it? Your mother didn't make you pancakes this morning. Why you always gotta be picking on me? Can I tell you something serious for once? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Buck up! - I'm getting drafted! All right, you want to hear that? I got drafted this morning. - What? - What? I got drafted today. For like the Army? What the fuck do you think? Of course the Army. Are you serious? I'm being serious with this. I got this in the mail this morning. What am I gonna tell my mom, man? - You haven't told anyone yet? - I don't know how to. All right, just, we'll think of something here, all right? Mikey, this is not a fuckin' suggestion! This is a- This is a draft card, you understand me?! They're not asking me, they're telling me! We're gonna think of something, all right? We're gonna think of something. What are you gonna think about? Listen guys, I just wanted to tell you, you know, like thank you, you know and I'll miss you guys. Listen, stop talking like that, all right? Listen, we grew up together. All right? We're like family. Yeah, don't talk like that any more. Listen, think, think, think. We're gonna figure something out here, all right? What am I gonna do, Mickey? Huh, what am I gonna do? This is not me, man, this is not me. We could put you in a car and we'll sneak you across the borde. I will drive you to Canada. - You could hide out. - Who wants to go to Canada? I'm going with you. Mickey. Mickey. I love you... you're like a brother to me but you got a life here. You know I ain't got nuthin', man, and you got a life here. Vinny, no, listen, we grew up together, we're like family, all right? You're like my brother and you're not going there on your own. Are you-you'd do that for me? Who's gonna watch your back, huh? Are you serious right now? You kidding? We're going together? We're going together, huh? What are you lookin' at me for? All right, forget about it, I'll come too. What? You need somebody to take care of your ass. You come too? No, you're not- You're gonna have your head so far up his ass, you'll need someone to watch out for you and I'll shoot them little gooks when you guys are doing nothing. You know he wouldn't do it. I'd end up shooting you in the ass And I'd shoot you just because. Just make sure I'm not with Becky when you do it, huh? Hey, God bless you, Mickey. What's up? - I love you. - I love you too. So much. I do too. You know I want to be with you, right? Yeah, I want to be with you too. I want to be with you, be with you. I-I've never felt like this before. - Me neither. - Not with anyone. I love you. I have to tell you something. What? Vinny got a draft card today. - He did? - Yeah, he did. He's going into the war. - That's awful. - Yeah. Yeah. He must be really upset about it. Yeah, I mean can you imagine Vinny in the war? I think I'm the one that taught him to tie his shoelaces. His shoelaces are always untied. The kid's a mess. I know, he is. I told him I was going with him. Why? Because he's my brother. He's my family, and I... I... I can't risk losing him. Can you imagine him out there in the middle of the war? I mean, like, he- - Why would you go? I'm... I'll be there to... I'm like his brother. I'll- I'm gonna take care of him out there. - Tommy's coming too. - No. We're gonna look after each other. And we're gonna... We're gonna take care of each other out there, so... What about me? You can't just leave like that. I know, I know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't-I wasn't planning on this, this just happened. You promised we would spend the whole summer together. Baby, I promise- We have some time. We're gonna spend a lot of time together but- - I want to spend time after the summer together. I do too, I really do. I don't want to go. - Baby, I don't want to go. - I don't want to be here. I want you to take me home. Mary, listen to me. No, no, I want to go home. - I want to go home. - Listen to me. - I'm sorry, Mary, I have to go. - No. - No, you don't. - I have to. - No, you don't. You can stay here with me. - Yes, I do. - I have to go, Mary! - No, you don't. Yes, I do! I can't leave him there! I can't leave him by himself there! Tommy's coming! We're gonna look after each other. What about me? What am I to you?! I love you so much. You are everything to me. I love you too, and that's why you should stay. I don't want to go, Mary. I don't want to go but I have to. You understand? Do you understand that? He's my family. He's my brother, and I have to go. I don't want you to go. I promise you that it's all gonna work out somehow, okay? Everything's gonna work out, okay? I believe you. Everything's gonna be fine. I want to be with you forever. I do too. You do? Yeah. I do. Back before you know it. Blink of an eye. Pick up right where we left off. To a ticker tape parade, and a hero's welcome. - Yes. - Yeah? Yes. Yes? Yes. Yes?! Five hundred and forty nine thousand soldiers served in Vietnam in the year 1969. Five hundred and forty nine thousand goodbyes. - Mickey. - Hey, let's go! Hey, Mikey, let's go! That's my cue. Five hundred and forty nine thousand promises to come home. Hey, come on, asshole. We gotta get goin'. You all rig? Mary, we'll see you later, huh? Hey, what do you want, a fuckin' parade? Get in the car. We'll have him back to you in no time, all right? Hey! Bye. Look at this guy. Don't worry, we'll make sure we tuck him in at night. - Mary, we'll see you soon. - Yeah. See you in a bit. We'll have him back before no time. They'll probably kick us out for being ugly. The thing about luck is... you don't know you had it, until after it's gone. All right, here we go, boys. Here we go, boys. Thanks so much for coming with me, guys. I told you before, if I get shot while I'm over there, - I'm gonna fucking kill you. - Thank you so much, Mickey. And so it went on. We made our plans. Vinny got laid. Tommy was still an asshole. And just like a bunch of ready-made tin toy soldiers... we were processed and shipped out. And the war would be just an adventurous interlude a brief chapter in our long fortunate lives. Hey, how come you ain't eating? 'Cause I ain't hungry. Here, have some of mine. You're like my mother sometimes, you know that? Yeah? Who else is gonna let you know which end of that rifle's the dangerous one? That one, right? Yeah. Hey, how's Mary doing? You heard from her? - Yeah. - Yeah? - She's good. - Yeah? She's pregnant. - No. - Yeah, yeah. - No. - Yeah. You're gonna be a daddy? You're gonna be a daddy? You're gonna be a daddy? Look at you. All grown up. - Can you believe that? - Congratulations, Mickey. I'm gonna be a father. I'm gonna be a father! I'm so sorry, Mickey. Damn, I'm so sorry. What are you talking about? I got you in this shithole, man. You and Tommy, you shouldn't be here, this was my fight. I just want you to know that you should be at home with your wife, meet your kid, you know? Nah man, we're in this together. I just hope we make it out all right, man. In the middle of the bloodiest time of the war, we saw too many of us fall. We were looking for the big fight the highest kills but the VC knew it. Their platoons stayed small, moved constantly, used our own signals against us, ambushed us, then disappeared. But if we did catch up to them, we had a score to settle. And we were fucking pissed. Holy shit... Vin! Look what we got here, fellas. Go ahead. Pull it. Pull the fucking thing. Pull it! Pull it, motherfucker. Pull it. Looks like we got ourselves here a quitter, guys. - Hold this. - Baptize his ass, Squiggs? You know what we do to quitters, huh? Yeah! Baptize that motherfucker! Go ahead! Oh yeah, how you like that, huh? When people ask me about the war, I don't know what to say. Go ahead! Earn your stripes, baby! Yeah! Get it in his mouth! Get it in his fuckin' mouth! Yeah, you motherfucka. I could tell them about the VC. I could say how you lose your humanity. How you like that? How I witnessed it firsthand. How it still haunts me today. It burns, right? It burns! How we did our duty. Served our country. Honored our last brothers. - Squiggs, Squiggs, come on, man- - Shut the fuck up! But did we really? I don't know. Fuckin' earn your stripes! What the fuck is goin' on here? But I do know that anybody that wasn't there would never understand it. - Get the fuck out. - Yes, sir. Tommy! Tommy! Cover me while I move! Moving! Don't go, Mickey! Mickey! Don't do it! Tommy! Medic! Tommy! Medic! Medic! Medic! Let me see it. - Please... - Medic! Medic! Medic! Tommy! Tommy! - Echo Three, this is- - Blackbird! Blackbird, do you read me?! We need air support now! We need help! Where the fuck are you?! 76 Bravo, this is 24... I need a medi-vac here! We need air support now! We got men down! Do you copy?! You're gonna be all right, all right? Don't fuckin' lie to me. You're lookin' good, all right? It's nothing. It's like the time you fell off the porch. Remember that? Stay with me, okay? Stay with me! Stay with me! Looking good, all right, buddy? - I don't wanna die. - You're not gonna die! Stay with me, stay with me, okay? Fuckin' Joe DiMaggio, right? Here, here, here, all right? I fuckin' hate Joe DiMaggio. Come on, we gotta go! Sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Hang in there, okay buddy? You're lookin' good. Lookin' good. Stay with me. Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Stay with me, okay? Stay with me! Stay with me! I fuckin' hate Joe DiMaggio too, man. Let's go, move out, move out! We gotta move out! We gotta get him outta here! Come on, let's go, let's go! Let's move! Get him up! That was the last time I ever saw Tommy. I knew every expression he ever made. But after that day, I could never get that look on his face out of my head. I told the guys in my platoon, "I don't know if he made it to Heaven," "but if Tommy ever saw the Devil," "he'd look him right in the face" "and he'd tell him, 'Go fuck yourself.'" They nodded, and laughed and toasted to my friend. Of course, that false bravado came from fear. A fear that grew inside each and every one of us. Something we'd never be able to say out loud. Never be able to name or put a face to. But there it was. And it never went away. There was no hero's welcome for us. There were protests in the street. We served our country. And they hated us for it. The Vietnam War was over for me now. But another battle had just begun. Who needs a damn parade anyway. You remember the men who fell before you in W W Two. A real war, I might add. - You wanted to see me, sir? - You like your job, De-puke-o? It's DeLucca, sir, Michael DeLucca. I could give a rat's ass. The answer is no, you do not like your job. It's people like me who made this country strong. The men who stand up, who make a difference. And I certainly don't wanna lose it all to no lazy fuckin' alcoholic pathetic goomba piece of shit! Excuse my French. Like yourself. Excuse me, sir, but I fought for this country. I'm cuttin' your hours! - No, sir, wait- - Get the hell outta my sight! I need those hours! - Yo Rocky, what's up, buddy? - Hey, where you been?! Tony, what did I tell you, man? You don't even gotta say it but you're welcome, brother! Fuck you, you prick! Yo, what's up? How was work? What's the matter with you? Marty cut my hours. Piece of shit. - You're telling me. - You know what you need to do, right? The next time Marty calls you into his office, you wait until that motherfucker starts giving you one of them, how do you call those? - I built America. - I built America. That's it. That's the one. Well right when he's done, you get up and say "Thank you very much," pull your pants down and tell him to kiss your ass and walk the fuck out. - Yeah? - Do it. Yeah, thanks for the tip, Danny. Hey, if it were me, I'd take a shit on his fuckin' desk, but hey... I just work here, right? - I'm getting fucking evicted. - I don't know how much longer I can take this low paying shit, Danny. I can't do it anymore. You take it easy. My man, stay tight! Yo Mikey! What are you doing later, eh? I don't know, why? Jesus, Danny, I have a question for you. You heard of an AC? 'Cause this shit ain't working. It is fuckin' hotter in here than it is outside. Sorry bro, been meaning to get that fixed. Shit. All right, so this is for real, this is the place? So what kinda work you do in there? Simple shit, you know, plumbing, electrical. Whatever that prick needs, he calls me. Nothing more. Pays me shit. If you want out, now's the time. You know that, right? Yeah, I know that. Good. 'Cause you're about to be a fuckin' rich motherfucker! - Rich motherfucker. - That's right! Rich motherfucker. So how are we planning on doing that? There's a safe. Greedy motherfucker barely pays me but he's sitting on a shitload of cash. - Yeah, how do you know that? - I hear things. So where is it? Hand me that Allen wrench over there, will you? Tell you the truth, I ain't quite sure. What?! What do you mean you ain't quite fucking sure?! - Hey, lower your goddamn voice. - Danny, I swear to God... if you're gettin' yourself in one of these fucking cockamamie- It's here. It's here, all right? Where?! Behind one of them paintings or some shit. Saw them hide it once. What?! Not sure where really. Why? Why would they do that? They live upstairs. What's so fucking funny, Danny? Jesus, you're really aiming for the fence with this one. Tell me about it. Guess they figured it'd be a safe place to hide it. Beats the fuck outta me. Old fuckin' bastard didn't trust me either, I guess. Yeah, I wonder why. Smart ass. There you are, you bastard. Freeze your fuckin' balls off now, motherfucker! We just have to find it, Mikey. It's as easy as that. Hey, don't think so much. You'll give yourself a fuckin' aneurism, come on. Hey, neighbor. Hey. What's with you always showing up out of nowhere? Sometimes it's good to be invisible to assholes, right? I wouldn't know, Houdini. Where ya headed? Drown my sorrows. Wanna come? I got a better idea. Not likely. - Meet me at Pauley's at 8. - Pauley's, isn't that, uh... I hate delis! Tough shit! I like to come out here. Think about things. Every time I close my eyes, I remember. Every time I wake up at night, I walk the streets, I take the bus, I talk to people, I shake hands. I remember. I need a change, Jane. I need to get out of this fucking town. If I left, would you come with me? Michael, we don't have to run away. You can make a change here. You're right. I can. And tomorrow night, everything is gonna change. Yeah, how's that? I got a break. What kind of break? A new job. Oh really, where? - At a... art gallery. - Art? I didn't know you were into art. Yeah, me neither. The one on Washington and Cherry? - Yeah, that's the one. - That's pretty fancy. How'd you get a job there? Michael... Yeah? What's inside that head of yours? We've heard too many companies, too many battalions wanna walk the road. This is CBS News Special Report. The world of Charlie Company with CBS News Correspondent- ...their attitude since 1970. A sense of independence. Sometimes there was open rebellion. I'm here. It was an internal conflict within the Armed Forces Why can't you stay? He's my brother. He's my family. I- - I'll be there to-I'm like, I'm like, I'm like his brother. I'm gonna take care of him out there. - Tommy's going too. - No! We're gonna look after each other and we're gonna- - So you're just gonna leave? Why can't you stay? We're gonna take care of each other out there... We're determined to survive. Yes! Yes! Yes! They insisted on having something that- Pass, Dad. Hi, Dad. Hey. Amazing. My life before the war now feels like a distant dream. When your every day is kill or be killed, there's almost a comfort to the simplicity of it. And then you come back. And it's almost as if war made more sense than it does over here. I knew guys that kept going back to Nam. I thought they were crazy. But once I got back, I finally understood why. You come back to a world you can no longer remember. Dear Michael, I hope this letter finds you in good health. I can't pretend to imagine what you've been through these last few months. Enclosed is a picture of your newborn son, Jacob. We couldn't bring ourselves to give you this news earlier and it saddens me to tell you this, Michael. Mary died giving birth to your son. Complications in childbirth. He needs you now more than ever with her gone and we need you as well. He's here with us. We're waiting for you. Hardship discharge. I guess they didn't need me anymore. But that didn't matter. I had a son to look after now. Mary's parents were taking care of him for me. So I was going home. Michael. Come. Would you like to hold your son? My son. Don't worry, your father's here. Everything's gonna be all right. Vinny... Vinny! I can't find it. I can't find it. My compass. Vinny, I can't find my compass, man! I'm so-I'm sorry. Leave it at the door. Hungry? Sorry for waking you. Don't worry about it. I needed to get a headstart on cleaning anyway. I can see that. Oh, you like that? I brought groceries, you know? I owe you one, missy. This is a historic moment. The arrival of the North Vietnamese Army in Saigon. Right in the middle of Saigon, just after 12 o'clock, Just after noon. Here they are pouring down the main avenue. This war's gonna be over soon. This war is never gonna be over. Seriously Michael, it's just a matter of time. You know, thanks for breakfast but I gotta get going. You barely ate. I'll finish it later. Michael, listen, uh... A few of us are getting together later and, well, I completely understand if you don't want to come but I guess what I'm trying to say is- Spit it out, Jane. There's a protest. Jane. Look. Just come by and hear it out, see how you feel. - Just think about- - Don't! You should let your hair down more, you know. Four days, you hear me. Four days! Hey, Mr. Mortetti! Nice to hear you this morning! Fuck off! What was all that about? - I think I made a friend. - Oh really? - Jane. - Let's see. Hey! Jane, please. Nice, looks like you got it all figured out, don't you? - What, like you? - Like me? - Gimme a break. - No, what about me? Go back out there and fight for shit that doesn't exist. At least I stand for something. Stop! Stop! You stand for nothing... but yourself. That's not true. Go. They talk about the horrors of war. But that's just what it is. Just talk. If you've ever seen it, you don't talk about it. Because there is no talk. There aren't any words to describe it right. Because it's not words. It's images of your friends getting shot up. It's sounds of screams and the deathly silence afterwards. It's smells of their stench and rotting flesh. It's bloodstains you can't ever wash away. Any minute now. It's a little chilly out there tonight. Where the fuck have you been? Who the fuck is this? Joe, nice to meet you. Danny! I meant to tell you about this. - You meant to tell me? - Yeah. - Is there a problem here? - No, there's no problem. Yeah, there's a fucking problem! Who the fuck is this?!

You're out of your fucking mind. You told me this would be easy. We're in, we're out! Nothing's changed, okay? He's just gonna be a lookout. - A lookout?! - That's right. Believe me, we might need him. Fucking Christ. Look, I'm not gonna get in y'all's way. - I know you're not gonna get- - All right, all right! We fuckin' heard you, you fuck! Shut the fuck up.

Then how do you know we need a goddamn key?! Shut the fuck up and help me, will you? Danny, I swear to Christ, it better be here. Lower your voice. - Guys, guys! - What? Sh.

Fuck it, we gotta move, you hear me, you hear me?! I said fuck it! Let's go! Come on, man. Danny? Shh. I'm not gonna say it again, you fuckin' cheapskate. No more playing around. She dies if we don't find nothing, you understand? - Do you understand?! - Yes! - Danny. - Shut up! - Danny, don't do this. - Shut up! - What are you fucking doing? - Shut the fuck up! What the fuck are you doing? Joe! Do it! No! Lemme do it! Lemme do it! Hold up! Hold up! No? Okay. No? You gonna tell me? Where the fuck is it? Come on! Tell me! - Okay. - Okay? - Okay. - That's it.

Grab whatever you can! You fuckin' hear me?! Let's get outta here, man! Go, please! It's gonna be okay. No. Did you fuckin' hear me?! Let's go! It's okay! Let's leave and forget any of this happened! So you're gonna listen to this bitch now, eh?! Day after day I hear you, yap-yap-yap, blah-blah-blah... You can't pay shit! That you ain't worth shit! I go ahead and offer you shit and you puss out on me like a little bitch?! - Don't listen to this psycho! - Shut the fuck! Up! Fuck you, Danny! - Fuck me?! - Yeah, fuck you! Noooo... Fuck you, bitch! If a person has a soul I think it's like a sponge. A recorder of events documenting imprinting everything you see and do. Soaking it all up. And then carrying it with you wherever you go. Forever. You don't talk much, do you, son? Well, that's all right. I'll wake you when the ride's over. I didn't have a reason anymore. No direction. No schedule. No agenda. No tasks. No leader telling me what to do. It's all gone now. And I'm all alone. Searching for something a foothold to keep me from sliding off the face of the earth for answers for an escape for hope a way forward a way through it all to take me anywhere anywhere but here. And then eventually, sometimes, you find that some things start searching for you. You're making me come. Yes! Oh, God. - Do something for me? - Oh, anything, baby. Close your eyes. That's it. Shh, shh, shh, don't breathe now. Saddle up! - Oh God, oh God... - You like that? - Yeah. - Louder! Hey, where you going? Where you going? Where you going? Come on! You better be washing that shit, motherfucker. Are my windows clean? That's him, that's him. That's him, Billy Boy. So, man. You are havin' some sort of problem there, fella? Look, why don't you guys do yourselves a favor, huh? Walk on. We got an out-of-town baby killer on our hands, don't we? Woo, baby boy. We surely do, Billy, we surely do. I'm gonna need you to back the fuck up from that car. Do it, faggot! You got a problem here? Listen to him, boy. Turn around! What the fuck? I said turn your ass around, boy. - Seems like he likes it. - What the fuck? This some sorta fuckin' comedy show, huh? What the fuck is so funny with you, bitch? What the fuck's the matter with you? Motherfucker, I'll give you something to laugh at. I'll give you something to giggle. He's a fuckin' loon, Lloyd. - You wanna know? - Tell me, boy! You fuckin' tell me. There ain't nothing, nothing that you can do to me that hell hasn't already done. - Fuck. - He's talkin' purty! Motherfucker. Let's get him now, boys. Sure. I needed help. A little support. In the end, I just needed the war to stop. Mickey, I love you. You're like a brother to me but you got a life here. You're kidding, we're going together? We're going together, huh? Would you like to hold your son? Just hope we make it out all right. Hey, Mikey! Let's go! Your son needs his father. Come back to us. Move out, move out. Mikey, this is not a fuckin' suggestion, man. This is a draft card, you understand me? I'm so sorry! Medic! Vinny, I can't find my compass, man. Enclosed is a picture of your newborn son. He's here with us, we're waiting for you. Hello? Hello? Hello, is anybody there? Who is it, baby? I don't know, no one's answering. Hello? Hello? Michael? Is that you? Vinny. Vinny! I can't find it. I can't find it. My compass. Vinny, I can't find my compass, man! Hey Mickey. I got it, man. No, Vinny, no! When I was a little boy, my mother gave this to me. And she told me that if I was ever lost or scared that this would lead me back home. And now, I want you to have it. And if you ever feel alone, you just take out this compass and know that I'm always with you. Because I love you very much, my son. This is Jacob. You're not gonna believe this. We found your father. Here's the address. My mother used to say you either bend or you break. And when you break, sometimes you grow stronger in the broken places. And sometimes, you don't. But if you can last if you can stick it out time has a funny way of curing even the incurable. And then sometimes when we're standing on the precipice staring into the abyss of it all life can offer us even just glimmer of hope Take it. It's worth it. And then maybe just maybe you can have some peace my friend.
