It's not easy to have this talk. NETFLIX PRESENTS I'm extremely anxious. How do I get started? How do I tell you? How do I say it? I mean, I'm constantly talking to you in my mind. How do I say it? How do I tell you? No, actually, I want to say it straightaway. I need some time alone, Burcu. I want some personal space. You know, my sister won't leave. I get overwhelmed at work too. Besides, we're together… Please, don't cry. You're very precious to me. You know that. Are you ready to order? I'm waiting for someone. But you've been talking. - Well… - What's up? Hello. Didn't you go to work today? I'll go later. Erbil can handle it. Did you order? I waited for you. So? Tell me. What are you going to talk to me about? Well… Let's… Let's order something first. It's… We will. You can talk till then. Oh, right. - Where is your necklace? - What? - The one I... - Yes, are you ready to order? Yeah. I'd like a cup of low-sugar Turkish coffee. Okay. You? - Do you have alcohol? - Whoa! Is it that obvious? So where is your necklace? What's up? "What's up?" Did something happen? The euro. What happened to the euro? It's rising. It's incredible. And about Syria… - Oh no. Something happened. - It's nothing. It's been a long time since we talked alone like this, Burcu. "Burcu?" Don't be like this. Please don't scare me. I haven't been able to spend time alone for a long time. I need some time alone. And this causes stress. I mean, some time alone… I have no time for myself. And my sister won't leave the house. It's been six months. They won't leave. You know Caner. He's a psychopath. I mean… He also reflected his madness on you. I mean… - He said, "Uncle, let's..." - Aziz. "Let's play Lego." Where is the necklace? I thought you said you'd never take it off. - You're obsessed with the necklace. - Of course I am. Why don't you answer me? I'm asking you something. Stop beating around the bush. Answer me. It's a very simple question. Where is the necklace? You can say "in the bag" or "in the drawer." But you aren't answering my question. You're talking nonsense. I don't understand. You make me feel weird. You said you'd never take it off. So where is the necklace? You said you'd never take it off. So where is the necklace? You said you'd never take it off. So where is the necklace? You said you'd never take it off. Where is it? Have you seen Erbil? - No. - Did he go out for lunch? - Did anyone ask for me? - No. I couldn't break up with her. I mean, I could, but she couldn't. You need a lawyer. No, we're not married or anything. There's no ring. There was a necklace, and I lost it. I removed the horse that bit the baby's face. - What? - Otherwise we'll struggle. There are a lot of animal lovers on Twitter. They'll ruin our campaign. No problem. All right. Aziz. - You're back? - Yes, I am. I've been looking for you. Have you finished your work? Mr. Alp asked about you. About what? He asked the girls if Aziz came. They told me too. I knocked on his door in case there was anything I could help with. I'll ask Alp, sir. Well… Let me ask you something. I stayed over at your place the other day, remember? Right! It was a beautiful day, Aziz. We should do it more often, shouldn't we? Did I forget a necklace at your place? - A necklace? - Yes, a necklace. - Something like a chain. - Whoa! - "Like a chain." - Yes. No. Anyway, I'll look in on Mr. Alp. A necklace, huh? Was it valuable? It isn't lost. It'll show up when I clean the house. It's bad if you lost it outside. I mean, on the street or something. He left. Sit down if you want. He lost his necklace. "Something like a chain," he said. It's very valuable. - He didn't say that. - Were you listening to us? - Did you step on it? - How many times have I told you? - What do you mean? - Don't yell! The neighbors will hear! - What a drag! - I used it and put it on the table! - Come in! - How could you step on it? Oh! Aziz, come in please. Mr. Necati, Ms. Füsun, please meet Aziz, the friend I just mentioned. He's number one when it comes to editing, CGI. - Hello. - Welcome. Aziz made all of the fake virals I just had you watch. He's really a genius. You made the man who fell while wiping the glass, huh? It's very realistic. I love it. Good job. You called for me? Yeah, Aziz. Sit down, please. I want you to listen too. Mr. Necati wants to hire us. Cansu got a good vibe. What can we do together? How do we take it to the next level? Could you explain to Aziz? How many views we have? - More than 400,000. - 420,000. He asked me. Dear God, we're just talking. Don't be a child. - It might be better if one of us talked. - Okay, Necati. Anyway, go on. What do you mean? - What are you doing right now? - What kind of language is that? What language? Go on, tell them. - Dear God! - What happened? - Füsun! - "Füsun" what? Dear God. - He asks... - So I gave him an answer. You gave him false information. - Like what? - You said, "400,000." - You need to say 420,000. - Excuse me, but he asked me. - So what? - I said, "More than 400,000." You need to say 420,000. - That's not the case. - You must give clear info. Don't miss this chance, Cansu. Take out your phone. Girl! Hey! Bravo! Okay then, tell them! What are you doing? Cansu! She ran away again. If her future didn't depend on it, we wouldn't do such things. She has been badly affected. And I feel bad as a mother. - But you can't understand that. - She puts so much effort into it. - Okay? We, as parents, make this effort... - We want to protect it. We want to support it because we respect it. That's all. As you can see, she has a talent for cinema. That's undeniable. And we want to support her. But now, we're stuck. The views have dropped. And the ads stopped coming. I mean, there was a flow. But there isn't anymore. For the last month, nothing. We need to fix this, Mr. Alp. You have to show us a way. We have to find something more creative to get ahead. I can beat the shit out of her. I can throw her out of the window. Or she can throw me out. And Cansu could record this. Could this be done? Would the effects be realistic? Beating, window, and so on. If it isn't realistic, we'd be disgraced. - It's possible. - This one time we were fighting. She filmed it secretly and put it on the Internet. - It all started like this. - He got angry. - I freaked out. I didn't like it. - He's right. After all, it's our private life. Then she showed me. "Look, Dad. Views, comments, and so on." - And her talent is obvious. - And money and so on. - It was amazing. - And her talent is obvious. I mean, we have one child. - God bless her. - Donation. When… When she is affected by it… I get upset. Motherly love. Occupied! Aziz. Where have you been? Let's go downstairs. The girls are really hot. Alp, I would like to leave now, huh? You were going to break up with your girl. Don't ask! Oh, Alp! Aziz! Don't drink too much! You're not used to it! I'll find you! Go ask for my cocktail! Find Zagor, and ask for my cocktail, bro! Excuse me? I'd like to have a glass of vodka and orange juice, but it's vodka. - It's vodka what? - I mean, without vodka. Are you Zagor? Go away, bro! Go away! I would dance, but the dance floor is so crowded. Alp is so nice! He's also funny! And handsome too! So how do you know each other? Alp is full of fun! Yeah. Aziz, where are you going, bro? - I gotta fly. - No way! - Why? - The belly dancer is coming! It's a new year, bro. It's only October. Life won't pass by if you think like that. Let's do nothing then. Is that so? I can't enter the new year with you. - No way! Aziz! - I'm outta here! Aziz, bro! Please! I love your new house. The bathroom is fantastic. Happy New Year! I'll see you at the office. How much do I owe you? We agreed on 60 girls but I brought 80 for you. - You know this. - So nice. - I won't take money for the boys. - So nice. Five hundred liras for the costumes. That's a total of 50,000. And the taxi fees. Spasibo. The rest is yours. - Bring me the taxi vouchers. - What about you? - As we agreed before, 4,500 liras. - We're leaving! Let's get together quickly! - What about you? - Seven hundred and fifty liras. - Good, it's cheap. - These are the prices. - I said, "It's cheap." - I'm sorry. - Why? - I can't give you a discount. You forgot about me. - How much do I owe you? - Two thousand. Plus travel expenses. - Stay here, deduct the expenses, huh? - No thanks. Do you have the hard disk? Huh? I have the hard disk, Aziz. It's in my hand. In my right hand. I could also hold it in my left hand. But since I said it's in my right hand, I'll keep it in my right hand. - What? - I said the hard disk is in my hand! It's in my right hand. Don't worry! Okay then, Erbil. Put your hand down. I couldn't understand, Aziz! Come again! Isn't the music too loud? I wish you and your loved ones a long and healthy life, Aziz. Why, Erbil? Hey! Isn't this too loud? What's up? Uncle! Hey, Uncle! Why didn't you come last night? This anchorwoman on NTV is so sexy! You really missed it! The news was also very bad. "He died, she died." She got into a huff. The way she swings her hair… Oh! She really kills me! What are you staring at? Get up and let's play. The Legos are ready. Come on. Let's play. Huh, Uncle? Hey! Get up or I'll burn this bed! I swear! What are you talking about? Put your hand down! - Put your hand down! - Fuck off! Look at me! - Caner. - Yes? Anyway, I'll get up now. - Don't raise your hand to me! - Shouldn't I get up? Don't raise your hand to me! I'd better get up. - Do you hear me? - Yes, I do! What is the thing I hate most in life? - Vegetables. - The second most? How do I know? Healthy foods, fruits. No, not like that. The second most? - How do I fucking know? - I just said it. I don't give a fuck! Uncle! Don't drive me crazy! Did you just shut the door in my face? Hey! Did you just shut the door in my face? Open the fucking door! Open it! I'll swear, I'll break the door down! Open it! You left early last night. You were uncomfortable in the crowd. Let's hang out in peace tonight. We'll call two girls. Or we'll hang out alone, if you want. Whatever you want. If you want to hang out at my house, it's yours. No problem. If you want to hide something from your girl… Right? - Girl? - I'm just saying! Girl or boy. You can hang out with whoever you want. But you should come over tonight. We'll call two girls. Alp, you're obsessed with girls. - Right? - They never leave me alone, Aziz. - Really? - Really. They fall in love with me. No matter what I do. Whether I call them or not, they fall in love. When I fall, they call immediately. Then, I say to myself, "Alp!" "Yes?" "What kind of a man are you?" - "How can you..." - I have some work to do. So we can do it tonight. You really should come over to my place. We'll hang out in the forest, and go to the sauna, huh? - Would you like something to eat? - Now? No, tonight. How about two girls, huh? - I have a girlfriend. - But you were going to break up with her. No, I couldn't. You can break up with her at my place. Huh, Aziz? You said you'd never take it off. So where is the necklace? You said you'd never take it off. So where is the necklace? You said you'd never take it off. So where is the necklace? You said you'd never take it off. So where is the necklace? We're closing soon. We need to find a solution to this problem. You said you'd never take it off. So where is the necklace? You said you'd never take it off. So where is the necklace? You said you'd never take it off. So where is the necklace? You said you'd never take it off. - Burcu. - Where is the necklace? You said you'd never take it off. - Burcu. - So where is the necklace? - Burcu. - You said you'd never take it off. So where is the necklace? You said you'd never take it off. So where is the necklace? You said you'd never take it off. - No. - The necklace? Look for the necklace. I've already looked for the necklace. Maybe the cat played with it. - Do you have a cat? - No. But I want to have a cat. Loneliness is so hard, Aziz. I mean, you come over and stay with me once in a while. Thanks. You make me so happy, but I need somebody in the house. Either a cat or a Ukrainian. They say you can order one online for 500 dollars per month. She would do some housework and... Anyway, I'd better go. - Your choice. - My sister will worry about me. The good ones are 750 dollars. Okay. We'll talk at the office tomorrow. I'm sorry if I've disturbed you. They say the best ones are 1000 dollars. - Who says that? - Mr. Alp. He feels bad for me. Don't listen to Alp. Don't talk about this kind of stuff with him. Health comes first, Aziz. - You think so? - Of course. Okay, I'll keep that in mind. Do you drink lots of water? It's getting late. You need to drink water, Aziz. You need to drink lots of water. Keep that in mind. Life passes by so fast. Here today, gone tomorrow. Nobody tells each other this kind of important stuff. They keep it to themselves. - For example, health comes… - First. Bravo. This is my advice to you. You need to drink… - Lots of water. - …lots of water. Yeah. Anyway. It's getting late. I have to go to dinner. I ate, thanks. I'll keep it for another time. Please say hi to them. Yes, I will. Actually, I wanted to tell you something else, but I couldn't. I was beating around the bush. But it's nothing to worry about. I'm not okay. I just found out. Before Bairam, I went to visit my mother's grave. She always said that she wanted to be buried next to her father. And they buried her father at the top of the graveyard. I was out of breath trying to get there. And I got to the grave. I felt dizzy and passed out on my father-in-law's grave. And the water boy found me, threw water on my face, and I woke up. I couldn't move my arm when I woke up. And he said, "If you're going to sleep like that, go into the grave." I said, "No, I just dozed off." Anyway, I could barely stand up. Let's keep it short. After Bairam, I went to see a doctor. And it's not good. I've never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I'm not good with alcohol. But my lungs… Yes? Dear customer, your phone line has been cut off due to unpaid bills. Please pay your bills as soon as possible. What I'm saying is that, Aziz, that's the case. You can pay your bill online… I think you should know about it. …using a debit or credit card. The doctor said I had six months to live. For the details… I said, "Doctor, are you serious?" He said, "Yes." …please press zero. "If you have no relatives, you can start making the necessary arrangements." …press two. Okay, then. Don't! What the hell is this, sis? Do you think this is normal? The boy misses you, Aziz. Just play with him. He's been talking about you all day. Uncle! - Is dinner ready? I'm starving. - Yes. He's barbecuing. Fuck! Fuck! Shit! Rüya! Water! - Rüya! - What happened? Be quick! Fuck! - Shit! Be quick! - Hold on. Fuck me! Pour that water! Heavens, no! Luckily we have some okra left from yesterday. If you don't eat it, I will. Come on, Uncle! What are you staring at? Are you eating or not? What are you staring at? Listen, in the name of this bread… If they weren't here, I would know what to do to you! - Just eat your food, boy! - Don't call me "boy!" Just eat your food! What is this, sis? Say something, brother-in-law! What are you looking at? Caner, my baby. Your uncle just came from work. He's tired. Let him eat his food, and then you can play together, huh? - There is no play or anything! - Mom! I don't like this kind of behavior. - Right? - Right. No, I don't. How many times have I told him! I say it all the time. Listen, I say it all the time without using any bad language, right? Right, son. - Right, dude? - Right, son. - Where are you going? Finish your meal. - The hell with it! If he behaves like this, he should starve! Give me the leftovers. Give it to him. He doesn't understand shit. He doesn't play with me. I've had enough of him! Hey! Give me the ones that he didn't touch with his fork. You've filled my plate with garbage. It's for your son, not your dog! Dear God. You said to give it to you, and I did. Why does he keep talking back to me, huh? You said you'd never take it off. So where is the necklace? You said you'd never take it off. So where is the necklace? You said you'd never take it off. So where is the necklace? You said you'd never take it off. So where is the necklace? You said you'd never take it off. So where is the necklace? You said you'd never take it off. So where is the necklace? You said you'd never take it off. Where is the necklace? - Burcu. - You said you'd never take it off. So where is the necklace? You said you'd never take it off. - Burcu! - Where is the necklace? You said you'd never take it off. So where is the necklace? You said you'd never take it off. So where is the necklace? You said you'd never take it off. So where is the necklace? You said you'd never take it off. So where is the necklace? Aziz. - Whoa! Bro! - How are you, Alp? Same, dude. Girls and stuff. - What? - I said, "Girls!" They won't leave me alone, bro! I'm at a party right now. Are you okay? I called you for that reason. - What reason? - We're in the same situation. I mean, girls and stuff. You said, "If you want to hang out at my place…." If you're not at your place… And you called immediately. Yes, I did. You wanted me to say that. Yes, I did. What do you say, bro? Yes, bro! Sure thing! My place is your place! You can get the key from the security guard. When are you coming? I mean, I'm going to meet this girl and… In half an hour. Is that okay? What a playboy you are! Of course. I'll hang up, then. The girls are waiting, bro! All right, Alp. See you. Thanks. Mr. Erbil, please come in. Are you comfortable? We'll start the process. You'll be able to communicate with me. You'll see some bright lights and hear some loud noises. But don't worry. It won't take long. By the way, you can keep your eyes closed if you want. I need you to hold this button, just in case. You can press it, all right? Mommy. - Did something happen? - Did you find the necklace? No, I didn't. Come over to my place. - We can look for it together. - We did. Don't you remember? - It's not at your place. - Probably not. - Hey! What's going on? Erbil! - Erbil! EMERGENCY HEALTH SERVICES Shit! Hello? I'd like to order some food. The address is correct. Do you have doner kebab? I'll have Turkish pizza with meat and cheese. You turned off the oven? Do you have any stew? Interesting. I'll have some soup then. Lentil... Then why are you open? I don't care. Then why did you pick up the phone? You asked for the address. I don't care about your birthday party. You asked for the address... If the kitchen is closed, then why did you ask for my address? Why did you pick up the phone? To say you're closed? For the love of God! So? Yeah. So? What cake? Then send me a slice of cake. No, I don't want candles. No, I don't want it. Why do you care about my age? I... For the love of God! Hang up! Shall we go to Erbil's? I was passing by. He was discharged from the hospital. We need to visit him. He's all alone. He'll be so happy to see us. You're eating a lot. You're making me hungry. But I don't want to eat at this hour. I'll have some tea at Erbil's place. We need to buy something for him. It'd be inappropriate not to. Anyway, you smoke. Then we'll stop by a bakery. Why did we go back home, Cevdet? Huh? Why did we go back? Huh, Cevdet? Did you forget your phone? Anyway, I'm waiting for you here... Cevdet. Cevdet, open the fucking door! Why have you been wandering around? Cevdet, open the fucking door! Cevdet, can I use your toilet? I need to pee. Dude? Toilet, man. Don't get me wrong, but I've fallen in love, Kamuran. They say it's never too late to fall in love, but they're wrong. Because I'm dying. Next year I'll be dead. I can't fall in love. İbn-i Haldun says, "Life is a long walk." If you don't want to be out of breath, "you need to find a new childhood." So I… Who is she? Who did you fall in love with? Tell me. Give it to me straight. Someone from the office. Her name is Vildan. She's a very nice woman. - Everybody loves and respects her. - What does she have that I don't have? - She's alive. - Bitch! - Don't say that. I'm dying. - I'm sorry for my loss. - She's very sensible. Believe me. - Is she young? No, she's our age. - Is she beautiful? - Yes, she is. I mean… She's all right. Well, like… Hang on. Who was it? Her name is on the tip of my tongue. - Has she ever been married? - Probably. Like I said, she's very sensible. So? Kamuran, I'm starving. I'll get something to eat. I passed out, Kamuran. My nose was bleeding at the office. I passed out. They called an ambulance, thanks to Mr. Alp. And then I ended up in the hospital. This hospital in Şişli. The one where we took your mother. The hospital has changed a lot. They renovated it. They built some new wings. You can't find a radiology floor like this, even in Europe. They have everything at the canteen. You name it. But let me tell you something. A tea costs ten liras. I said, "Whoa! This is robbery!" Erbil, never mind the hospital. What about the woman? Right. What I'm saying is, I'm dying, Kamuran. I'll come to you by the middle of June, before the heat is overwhelming. But I want to know something before I get there. I mean, before I get there, if something happens between me and Ms. Vildan, will you make death miserable for me? Will you talk about it all the time? Will you sulk all the time? I want to know. Don't say anything now. Think about it. But please think carefully. I want to know what will happen to me. - I beg you, for the sake of 30 years. - Does she know that you're dying? No, she doesn't. I couldn't tell her. But she saw the accident. I mean… She saw me when I passed out at the office. Tell her and see what happens. Who wants a man who will die in three days? Even if the man is Kadir İnanır. Why would she hang out with you at this age? - You think so? - Of course. Come to your senses, Erbil. Be patient. Don't act like a child. There's not much time left until June. You'll be laid low in a month or two. They'll give you a bunch of painkillers, and you'll be exhausted. You'll just lie in your bed all day. You'll beg to die. You know. I'm experienced with this stuff. I mean, would it be bad to have someone to talk to or to hold my hand? Fuck you, Erbil. Do whatever the hell you want! Oh, Kamuran! "Fuck you?" What's happened to you? You didn't swear for 30 years. You couldn't even say "donkey." What's happened to you? "Fuck you," huh? Something has happened to you. Huh, Kamuran? Is there someone with you? Have you met someone? Huh? Where did you learn those words? There was a guy in the building who swore. He was a contractor. He died of natural causes, they said. Did he commit suicide to meet you? What are you up to over there? Kamuran, please say something. Say… What… Whoa! How are you? I heard you were discharged, and I wanted to visit you. Do you need anything? - I need to die immediately, Aziz. - What? My wife is up to something on the other side. - I need to die immediately. - What? I need to... I wish he wanted something else. It was meant to be. I don't want him to die. You said he wants to die. He opened the door and said, "I need to die." He said something about his wife. I was about to ask him, but the chandelier fell on his head. He's up to something. He came back no sooner than he had left. He has insurance, right? Erbil. - Aziz. - It's me. Cevdet is also here. Get well soon, Erbil. What happened to me? The chandelier fell on your head. Really? Is it broken? Thank goodness you had a narrow escape. It was a wedding gift from my sister. It came from Tehran. My brother-in-law worked for Arçelik then. It came from all that way. Don't say it's broken. Erbil, are you in pain? - Where are we? - We're in the hospital. I brought you here when you passed out. Kamuran. It's me, Cevdet. From the office. Kamuran. Who saved me? I didn't save you. - Then who did? - I'm so anxious. Turn your head. Did you save me, Aziz? I took you to the hospital. The doctors saved you. Fuck those doctors. - Why did you say something like that? - Oh, Kamuran. You have insurance, right? They asked us, but we couldn't answer. What's going on in there, Kamuran? They'll take him to the cleaners. You have insurance, right? Is Kadir İnanır alive, Cevdet? He doesn't have insurance. He doesn't. Kamuş. Mom. Hey, Mom! Get up already! Hey! Mom! Dude! Come on! Hey, Dad! Get up already! Get up! I'm so bored. I swear, I'm so bored! Hey! Dad! Dude! Hello? How much money do I owe you? One thousand liras? Whoa! Good evening. Chicken doner or lamb doner? What are you saying, dude? What kind of a dream is that? - Did you grab it, son? - All right, dude. God bless you. Don't fall down, son. What do you think I am? Don't worry. Don't stand there. Go away. What are you looking at? Beat it! I'll call you when my practice is over. Okay, son. Listen, sis. You get angry when I say it, but he's not normal. Maybe you should take him to the doctor. Why are you saying that, Aziz? If he kills one of us, he won't go to jail because he's a child. We would be the victims. What are you talking about so early in the morning, Aziz? You're making me sad. He really likes you. He talks about you all day. Don't say that. He'll go to school next year, right? Yes, he will. I really don't know how I can send him to school. - You can send him to a boarding school. - He's just a kid. - Maybe to Southeastern, huh? - No way! People say Kars is a great city. There are so many amazing places. Ani Ruins, et cetera. Or maybe he can work in the auto industry as a child worker. - He'd adapt quickly. - Aziz, are you nuts? I couldn't even send him to kindergarten. - No way! - No? Never! Why are you being silent, Kamuş? We were having a nice talk. Even death couldn't separate us. What's happened to us? What's going on in there? Huh? Are you seeing someone? We've been life partners for so many years. You can tell me everything. I mean… Is this out of spite? Is it because of Ms. Vildan? I didn't want to do anything without you knowing. What was I supposed to do? I didn't hide anything from you. Not when you were alive, nor after your death. Did I do something wrong? Dear Kamuş. "YOU HAVE TO BE DETERMINED TO DO SOMETHING." Then call your girl. Huh? I mean, to the ski hill. You're hanging out at my place. She can come skiing with us. No, dude. She won't come. Did you have a good time last night? It was really amazing. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask you something. You're going skiing with Aybike tomorrow. Can we hang out at your place? Your place will be empty anyway, right? Huh? Of course. Sure thing. What a strange man you are, dude. Why? I mean, I don't know. What? You're hanging out with a girl, but there isn't any mess. Oh! Well… I'm smooth, huh? So smooth. What are you doing? Caner. What's up? - I'm fine, Uncle. What are you doing? - Nothing. Work and stuff. I mean, what were you doing in there? - Nothing. - "Nothing"? Yeah. I mean, I'm just wandering around. You're just wandering around in my parents' bedroom? - I just had a look. - You just had a look? Yeah. You just had a look at my parents' private space, huh? What do you think you're doing? Huh? Who do you think you are? Come here. Come on. - Where to? - Come with me. - Where to? - Come on. - Mom! - Caner. Take that bar out of there. - Why? - Take it out. Come on, Uncle! I can't reach it. Come on. All right, give it to me. Who the fuck do you think you are? - This is so disrespectful! - Huh? Caner! Sis! Sis! Come here! Sis! Kamuran. How is my Kamuş doing? Did you buy it? I saw this guy. The guy on the first floor. What was the name of that guy who swears? He said "Your wife... ". - Erbil. - Huh? - Did you buy it? - I didn't. The pharmacist wasn't there. I didn't want to be too familiar with his assistant. - And then... - Where's the bag? Well… What bag? Didn't you come home with a bag? I heard the noise. I bought yogurt at the grocery store. There's no yogurt left. Mr. Erbil, may I leave? Sure, dear. Thank you. Ms. Kamuran, see you tomorrow. - Good night to you both. - Good night. See you in the morning. - Erbil. - Honey. Do you want your soup? Hang on. Wait a minute. - Erbil. - Yes, dear? Kill me, sweetheart. Kamuran, please don't say that. Don't speak like that. Just do it. Don't do this, Kamuran. What would I do without you? I've had enough. The drugs have made you confused. I'll talk to the doctor tomorrow. Come on. I'll get your soup. Are you sweating, dear? I'll change your clothes. Hang on. Wait a minute. Oh my dear Kamuş. Let's eat some soup. Come on, darling. - Open your mouth. - Grapes… - Grapes… - Who? - Grapes. - Who is it? - I want grapes. - What grapes? Black grapes. Kamuran, where can I find grapes at this time of year? - You can find them. - I can't, honey. Where? Black grapes? At this time of year? What's going on? - I'm craving them. - Huh? All right. I'll look for some tomorrow when the nurse comes. Now. Please, Kamuran. How can I find black grapes at this time of the night? I'm really craving them. The store next to my parents' old house must have some grapes. Your parents? At Kuruçeşme? The grocery store next to the mosque? Kamuran, are you nuts? At this time of… How can I leave you alone at this time of the night? Come on, I'll look for them tomorrow when the nurse comes. - Open your mouth. - Now. All right. All right. Go back to where you picked me up! Fast! Oh! Kamuran! ADİL SOYLU AL-FATIHA FOR HIS SOUL Not like that, Erbil. You should clean it with a wet cloth. Erbil! Don't stand there. Go to the bathroom, take the cloth on the washing machine and wet it. Clean it well. Let's go. Kamuran? Oh boy! Yes, we talked a little bit, right Caner? I'm very pleased to meet you. Would you like to come and chat with me sometime? We'll see, Doctor. I can't promise. I don't want to be that guy. We'll see. Yeah. I'm going to talk to your parents now. There are some books you might be interested in. Don't you have a tablet or anything? What book, dude? Yeah. Mr. Rıza, Ms. Rüya. I'd like to give you some good news, but unfortunately it looks pretty severe. What's wrong with him, Doctor? Caner is… Unfortunately… A jerk. It's okay, darling. We don't see that very often at such an early age. Normally this wouldn't happen until puberty. It starts at school age. It settles in their character through exposure to popular culture. So. How advanced is it, Doctor? Is there anything we can do? I'd like to encourage you, but unfortunately the symptoms are scary. He speaks badly. He's arrogant. I'm sorry. Unfortunately, he's a bloody jerk despite his young age. Kamuran. Ms. Vildan is here. I don't know what she wants. How could she… Interesting. This is the lady I told you about. What should we do? Kamuş? Ms. Vildan? I made you some soup. Bone broth soup. They were talking about you at the office. You're a goner, aren't you? - Are you a goner? - Going where? To the afterlife. Have I gotten it wrong? Oh, right. Yes, you're right. I'm going to die. - Rest in peace already. - Thank you so much. We'll see. The doctors say I'll die around June. I can't offer you anything. - It's too early. - What can we do? This is an act of God. No, for the offer. May I come in first? Oh! Sorry. Of course. I'm so sorry. Come in. Please come in. Let me brew some tea quickly. I can't drink quickly brewed tea, Mr. Erbil. It makes me sick. It also tastes bad. When it boils, you need to lower the heat. Everybody says something. - But you need to boil it for 18 minutes. - Right? But if the teapot is cold… - You need to boil it for 25 minutes. - Right. I won't stay too long. - I won't take your time. - Yeah. Are you going to bed? No, not yet. I was going to the kitchen to get some water. You went to so much trouble for me. Well… Thank you very much again. Erbil. Kamuran. A glass of water isn't enough. She brought you some soup. Go and grab something from the bakery around the corner. Go and buy some lemonade. Kamuran, tell me if you feel anxious. I'll explain to her. I didn't know she was coming. Don't do it! It would be very inappropriate. Come on, darling. Listen to me. Go and buy some biscuits and some crackers. And take out the tea set that we brought from America. Don't put it with the bakery box. Oh, Kamuran. You were quiet, and now you're talking. Here you go. Would you excuse me for five minutes, Ms. Vildan? I'll be back soon. What's going on, Mr. Erbil? Just five minutes. Make yourself at home. I said five minutes, but it might take a little longer. It may take seven or eight minutes. Ten at the most. I'll expect ten. Let's say 12. The elevator is broken. There are four flights of stairs. - We need to... - Eleven? I wouldn't be able to face you if I didn't keep my promise, Ms. Vildan. - Vildan. - What did I just say? You said Ms. Vildan. You don't need to say "Ms." Yeah. I'll shout in Taksim Square. And he said, "You should deduct 5000 liras." Then I said, "If you don't want it, don't buy it." Right? It's clean. It has no scratches. It has no TRAMER record. And he said, "You should deduct 5000 liras." He said, "The door handles aren't original." If you can find its original door handles... Does the time start when you walk out the door? - What time? - Twelve minutes. Oh, right. Yes, sorry. Don't spare the rod, miss. Do you want something else? No. You put the lemonade in, right? It's in a plastic bottle so it won't spill. No problem. Cake, lemonade… Oh, do you want some candles? - What? - Do you want some candles? No. The building has a generator. Have a good one. I hope I wasn't gone for more than 12 minutes. Ms. Vildan? Shame on you! You're dead, but you still act like a little kid. Even a kid wouldn't do that. I don't hide anything from you. I mean, I told you, right? I told you I like Ms. Vildan. Didn't I tell you? Please don't do this. I'm tired. I'm exhausted. I mean, if you act like this… Okay, you're not talking, but why are you closing your eyes? Dear God. Kamuş. Our song is playing. Oh, Kamuş. I can't make head or tails of it anymore. You aren't talking, but show me the way, give me a sign, do something. For the love of God! How can I make it up to you? How can I reach you? Please give me a sign, Kamuş. There is one more possibility. Is it death, do you think? Tell me darling, what do you say? There is one more possibility. Is it death, do you think? Tell me darling, what do you say? Uniting with you in a different universe. You are worth a life. You are worth a life. Uniting with you in a different universe. You are worth a life. You are worth a life. Are you busy? I'm a bit busy but… Oh. Fine. Okay, then. I'll stop by later. Let me hug you. I mean… Take care of your work. I'll stop by later. I'll do it later. No problem. If there's anything I can do, I'm happy to help. You're too young. You're just a kid. Is it inappropriate? In monotheistic religions, yes. Religions? I wish you and your loved ones a long and healthy life, Aziz. What? - In my dream… - In your dream? You said something like this in my dream. Did you see me in your dream? - No, there were others but… - That's okay. Okay, I won't keep you then. Take care of your work. I just wanted to stop by. You did well, Aziz. You did very well. Yeah. Fine. We'll keep in touch. Well… - Anyway, see you later. - Aziz. Yes? - Health comes… - First. Yes, you've said that before. - In your dream? - No. In front of the door like this. I did well. Yeah. Fine. See you later. Goodbye. Well done to me. KAMURAN ÇINAR AL-FATIHA FOR HER SOUL He's gone. He wanted this. I wish he had wanted something else. Dear Aziz, since you're reading this letter, I must be gone. My house is yours. You've always wanted a place where you could be alone. This is a place where you can be alone. I lived alone in that house for ten years. Now it's yours. And see your mother's... Why did you put it in there, Erbil? I might not have opened this drawer for a few months. Bro. Bro. Whoa. He's gone, huh? - Yes, he is. - For real? Here, bro. It's yours. What is this? The keys to my house. What are you doing tonight? If you want to hang out, I'll be out. You can hang out there. Or with me. Thank you so much. But it's no longer necessary. - What? - I mean, I won't go to your place again. I'm really thankful by the way. Why? - You opened your house to me. - No. I mean, why? What happened? Well, I broke up with her. You won't come again? No. - Never. - Never. It's over. Oh, what a beautiful life!
