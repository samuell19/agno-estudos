You wait with me. Damn... What have they done to them... I've never seen something like this... So much blood... A real massacre, Inspector. - Did you find the weapon? - Yes, a knife. And a second body. A knife is not enough to reduce someone to this. Who could have done this? I asked the neighbors some questions... But they couldn't tell me much. They were from Italy, but they've been living here in Paris for years. C'mon, baby. C'mon. Come here. It's all over. Don't be afraid, it's all over now. You don't have to be scared anymore. I'm here with you now. ROME, 12 YEARS LATER. "INAUGURATION OF THE NEW HALL OF HORRORS AT THE WAX MUSEUM." - Wonderful, wasn't it? - Yes. As always. You're just... Beautiful. Really? Yes, you really are. Haven't you ever questioned ending up with this life? No... Why? You know... This is a vocation for me. - Avocation? - Absolutely. Madame always tells us: working in a whorehouse is like living in a convent. It takes faith, and my faith is my bed. Well... Madame must be very charismatic if she can make you believe such stories... Even if sometimes she's a little bit severe, she really loves and protects us. Yeah, she really knows how to protect her profits... Pardon? Nothing. It doesn't matter. Let's get the others. You see my friend... Fear is irrational. And there's no way to explain it. It's always born from the unconscious and often, there are no real causes. However it is known that for many people it is a real obsession. An illness that dates back to childhood. Back to bed? I believe that only weak people are impressionable. A man... when he's healthy in mind doesn't know fear at all... and body. It's easy to talk. But then, if you find yourself in certain situations it's a whole different story. Take the new wax museum. It must be terrifying to find yourself inside it at night. You're right! Someone told me those statues are really scary. Anyway, I really think you wouldn't be as unimpressionable as you say. I'm really convinced I wouldn't be scared at all. I'll bet you don't have the courage to stay the night there. I'll bet I do. But why spend a whole night there, instead of one in here... in bed. What do you say, Giorgina? I'll bet you 20 lire. - 20 lire? - That's many nights together. 20 lire? If you insist. Here. Are you really sure? To spend the whole night in there? I would do anything... just to make Giovanni lose. And after all I know how to spend that money. I have to go now or Madame!'ll be angry with me for sneaking out. No, wait, to make sure I go in. You'll be my witness. Tomorrow, you tell them you saw it with your own eyes. Tomorrow we'll collect the winnings and we'll drink champagne all night long. - Yes. Till tomorrow. - Bye. GALLERY OF WAX FIGURES He must have been locked in... Those wax figures in the dark must have frightened him to death. It is very rare, but sometimes it can happen. So your preliminary diagnosis is that he suffered a heart attack. He was young and may not even have known he had a heart condition. And what about that mark... - on his neck? - I don't have an explanation yet. Thank you, Doctor. You were really helpful. - Give me a hand. - You take his feet. Signor... Volkoff. Boris Volkoff This young man... did you know him? Not that I'm aware of. I assume you have no idea what he was doing in the museum? Last night, I locked the museum entrance doors as usual... after checking no one was here. I can't think how he got in. It's not that easy to break in. Apparently he did it somehow. Tell me, where does that door lead? To my laboratory. I'm surprised. I didn't expect the studio of an artist, such as you, to look like this. It's more like a scientist's laboratory. - I think of myself as a researcher. - And what exactly - are you researching? - Perfection... which is what all artists strive to achieve. I'm using techniques new to the artistic world. - Successfully? - You must judge that. Look at the exhibits in the gallery. I can't deny I'm very impressed. I would call them something more, Inspector. I would call them masterpieces. Thanks for your cooperation. I know where to find you if I need your help again. Delighted to be at your service. Didn't I tell you they'd employ me? You're always lucky. There's another candidate out here. Do you have any experience as a costume designer? No, but... I've worked for my aunt for many years. She owns a dress shop here in the city. Did you create these fashions? Yes. I'm sorry, but the position we advertised has now been filled. If you wish to leave your address for the future, just in case... What's your name? Sonia, Signore. Sonia. You can start work tomorrow. Nine o'clock. I'm sorry. Did it blind you? You'll be all right in a second. Forgive me. I should just say, I work for the "Messagero." You know somebody apparently died of fright in the museum. I'm writing an article about it, but I can't get an interview. They won't let anyone enter. - Do you work here? - Yes. From tomorrow. Then will you help me and persuade him to let me take some photos? But I hardly know him yet. And I don't even know you. Of course, I understand. I shouldn't have asked, sorry. My car's outside, may I drive you home? Thank you, but I think I can find my own way there. But I can't. Unless you give me your address. And why should I give it to you? Because I took your photo. You might like a copy of it. Do you have any change to spare, Signore? Go away. Wait. Come back. Like to tell me what - your name is? - Anna. You're very pretty. Pulcinella hasn't given me any money, and so I'm going to give him a good beating. If you play with a sword, in the end you'll get hurt. Thank you, children. Something for the showman. Thank you, my dear. You're very kind. Thank you, Madam. Aren't you a generous little girl. Thank you. As Pulcinella said... If you play with a sword, in the end you'll get hurt. Thank you. All right? Does it taste good? Let's go. Here we are. Have a sit. Come on. Will you undress or shall I do it for you? That's not why I'm here. Don't tell me this is your first time in a brothel? - No, that's not the point. - Then what do you want? Actually, I'd like to have a chat. Okay! I'm used to hearing confidences. And when I've listened to all your worst troubles, you'll let me make them go away. Yes, that's better. Right, let's talk. - And then leave the rest to me. - I'm a journalist. I only wanted to ask some questions. Well, you'd better go and talk to Madame. No, the questions aren't about the business she's running. You knew the young man who died of heart failure in the wax museum? - Luca? - Luca. He was very generous. What do you know about him? That depends... on how interested you are. Well... I think this should be enough to make things interesting. He was here that night, wasn't he? Don't be afraid. It's me. For a second... I imagined for a second a waxwork had touched me. Do they affect you so strongly? They're very life-like. Are you Italian? No, Signore... though I've been in Italy for many years. But actually I'm from Paris. Paris? I'm a native of Prague. A magical city. Have you ever been to Prague? Perhaps when I was a kid. We traveled a lot when I was little. No doubt even then your hair was as soft as it is now. I'm sure you were a pretty child. Can't you be more careful? You've damaged it, you idiot! Don't be angry. Don't be angry, I beg you. I'm sorry, Signore. You can always repair it, surely? It's only a statue Perhaps to others! They may be wax models to others, but not to me! Ciao! Oh, God. I almost had a heart attack! I'm sorry. - What is that poster? - It's to advertise a film. "The Man with the Face of Wax." I wondered if you'd see it with me. I'm sure you'd enjoy it. I might have, but after this trick you played on me I've lost interest. Let me walk you home then. Wait. Soon... very soon now we'll open our doors to the public. And my art will finally be revealed to the world. The death of that young man has given us so much publicity. It must be exploited. We must create new scenes... Stronger scenes... Alex... There are candidates other than Sonia. - You pig! Get out of the house. - I'll go when I want to. I won't let you use our daughter to beg so you can pay for your disgusting habits! I'm leaving you, I'm taking Anna with me. I can't take it anymore! You won't see her again. Ll mean it! I mean it! You're drunk again. Get out! Anna! How old was she? Her mother says she's 12, her father says 13, but they're too distressed to agree. Let me have a scalpel. How did she die? That's what I'm about to find out. She's still alive! Our pathologist found a puncture mark on her neck. Her attacker injected her with a drug our chemists can't identify. In effect it slows the heart almost to zero. We have an incident containing the elements for a great news story. Have you any idea who might have done it? No, none whatever. And my superiors aren't letting me have all the resources I need. You hope that good press coverage will increase general awareness? Quite so. I count on you to make that point. And there aren't any problems in getting to the girl? No. Money to her parents will open their door. But I'd just as soon not know you'd talked to them. I haven't done anything! I don't see why you've arrested me! This huge hand round my throat was hard. He was hurting me. And... was there anything else? Yes. The hand was made of iron. And then? Come, Anna, tell us. He's a reporter. Your story will be in the paper. Do you have anything else to tell me? He gave me a puncture. There was a long needle and I felt it go in. I was scared... Thank you. I'd like to take your photograph now. Do you mind? Keep very still. Are you all right, Sonia? I had... that nightmare again, Auntie. I'm not sure it was a good idea to work in the museum. You protected me against my own terror for too long. I have to face the world again one day or I'll go insane. I must have courage. My darling. Please send all information to Sonia Lafont. Paris, right? I didn't think you would succeed. - Succeed in what? - In keeping this job. For months Boris refused to employ anyone as costume assistant. No doubt you've noticed he's very nervous when there are strangers around. How long have you known him? He took me up when I was alone. I owe him my own life. My father... used to beat me until I bled. My skin carries the scars and my heart carries the hate which I shall always bear him. Boris has been good to me, never beaten me. Without him, I would scarcely exist. My life has purpose since I became his student. And I'm his only true assistant. Don't forget that. THE IRON HAND I was so terrified I couldn't breathe. Blood drenching everything... God, it was horrible. And that metallic hand... Those long terrible talons on it... I still have nightmares in which I see them. And so... when l... when I read your article... It made you feel you could tell me. Though I have to admit I hope you'd have told me anyway. I don't know why... why I'm telling you all this. Nobody else has heard it. Maybe it's just my honest face. Maybe. But... I know nothing about you. Well, we could... We could fix that. Would you like me to send you a girl, Signore? Not yet. I really must say these models are very convincing. I wouldn't think it possible to produce such realistic wax figures. I'm very flattered. I'm glad you like them so much. He's a reporter on the "Messagero." He's come to interview you. Many thanks, Sonia. Your effigies are very beautiful. - I'd like to take some pictures. - No, I don't think so. I'm not at all confident photographs would do justice to my work. Didn't you see the notices? It is forbidden to touch the statues. Look. Many years ago, this was worn by the most beautiful of women. No one has worn it since. - It's very lovely. - That's why it's for you. For me? A tribute deserved. It's finished, Boris. Jack the Ripper's statue is ready. He's very good. Marvelous, Alex. You've done well. And now, all we need is a victim worthy of Jack the Ripper. I have an idea... who that might be. Perfect, I think. "Come to this address, I want you now." - Thank you. - Generous as always. - See you in a month, I hope. - You will. - Elene? - Yes. I need your help. I want to meet a lover, just for an hour. - Who is he? - Read this note. Your admirer is anonymous, Giorgina. I'm sure I know who sent it, though. Would you take my regular Wednesday client? Madame makes it a rule never to disappoint a personal client. - Just this once. - Once too often. You can pretend I've gone to... the doctor, I feel ill. Then go. - But don't be too long, all right? - "Be clever and quick." Our motto. Thanks. Ciao! I've come. It's Giorgina. Where are you? Naughty boy. Are you hiding? Your wax statues and inventions, who cares about them? Who's interested? No one! You couldn't even see your wife has a real man now! Stop! - Did you hear? - What, Sonia? - I heard a noise. - It'd be your aunt. She wouldn't come here on a Sunday. Anyone there? The photo you took of me is gone. Who'd want it? Please. Go on, Elene. It's been four days since anybody saw her. I'm certain that something awful has happened. It's possible she decided she wanted a rest. No, she'd have told me. Surely she wouldn't have just gone. Besides, she left all her clothes in her wardrobe. I'm not the person to speak to. There's somebody on the next floor. He'll need a photo. I have one. It's not appropriate, but it's the only one I have. The photo is artistic. It was taken by a client. A Count. Count or not, I don't think we'll feature this. Perhaps if it's cropped... It's the face we'd need. As for the rest... Listen, speak to Rudolfo. - Tell him I sent you. - Thank you. Then I want you to come back. There's something bizarre about this, don't you think? Well, you aren't going to take photos of them all? - Why? Are we in a hurry? - Yes, I'm scared. Of what? Go stand by Count Ugolino. He won't eat you. Go on. We haven't got time to play around. Come on. - Spoil-sport. - Hurry up, Andrea. I was stupid to be talked into this. I'll lose my job if they find out. I'll be thrown out, thanks to you. Look on the bright side, it's known that no girl can resist me. If you do lose your job, I'll take you on... - As a wife and mother. - I'm being serious, Andrea. Please take your photos and get them out of here. And you promise not to publish anything? I know. Don't worry, I told you these are only for my scrapbook. No one else will see them. Hurry! - What? - I'm sure I recognize her. Different hair coloring, but... It's her. Who is she? She was a prosti... Well, the same as this statue, I suppose. You said "was", as if the girl was dead. Seems that she disappeared. I talked to her friend who was seriously concerned. She thought that something dreadful had happened to her. What a strange coincidence. There is an explanation. Boris's models... are based on people he's observed. And Alex draws their portrait. He may have known her, So he used her. Open it. Excuse me. - Marie Antoinette's dress. - Let me see. - Do you like it? - A bit too pale. I thought that it'd go well with the other... Sonia! It's all right. Don't be afraid. What happened? What on earth upset you? Open your eyes. Feeling better? Talk to me. You feel better? Let me help you. Up you get. You fainted. It's fine. It's all right... How stupid, I'm sorry. It's all over now. How did you copy the details so exactly? What do you mean? I still can't quite catch my breath. If it's all right, I'd prefer to go home. Do. Something odd's going on there. But what? Could you give a man a coin or two? Hey you! Stop! Courage, little one. It's all over now. You don't have to be frightened. Don't try to use it too much. In a month you'll be fine. Did you recognize the lunatic who did it? Inspector, think of a way to protect my niece. Madame... I've been protecting her for 13 years. And since then, Sonia's lived with me. I think better with a little more light. I beg your pardon, Inspector. I'm used to living in darkness, I forget it's not the same for others. A fall from an over-frisky stallion blinded me. The despair I suffered at first has receded with the years. Now the only pain is the feeling I haven't carried out my promise. What promise? I swore on the grave of my sister, I'd look after Sonia and protect her with my life. I was all she had. May we discuss your sister? Marta had got married when she was 17. A man called Volk, a mangy type. Dabbled in... in alchemy. Did experiments into Heaven knows what. In a few months she saw all too clearly the marriage was a mistake. She was saved when Volk died in an accident. She'd already met Victor. When did she start living in Paris? She went after the death of Volk. And is Sonia... Volk's daughter... or Victor's? Do you approve, Inspector Lanvin? - How do you know me? - You worked on the murders in Paris. I know your name from there. All the papers printed your photo. You haven't changed. You have a good memory. We seem to share that - characteristic, at least. - And there many be other interests we have in common. This slaughter in Paris, for example? Is my representation accurate? Yes. Perhaps too accurate. All artists try to aim for perfection. Yes, but it's so detailed. I don't think any paper gave some particular facts, such as the iron hand which is featured here, and about which only the killer could know. I'm sorry to disappoint you, Inspector. My motive to include the iron hand came out of a different case. A girl was attacked, and talked about an "iron hand." That girl could deny that. Why? Is the girl still alive? This time I believe you... otherwise the girl would be dead. No paper ever talked about her. To defend his safety. I'm glad to see you're looking better. Do you know Inspector Lanvin? No. Lanvin has never stopped looking for him since that night... Now he thinks he's found the lunatic who killed my family 12 years ago. But can't you identify him? I never saw his face. All I saw of him was that terrifying hand. Well, suppose he's right, suppose his suspicion that the killer was your mother's first husband is correct. Judging by all I've heard, he must be much older than your employer at the museum is now. Even so, the Inspector is absolutely convinced he has the right man. It's only suspicion. Suspicion's not enough. What you need is proof. Of course we do. He knows that. Which is why he wants us to work together. I can do certain things to unsettle Boris. Can you? What, precisely? What have you done? I told you not to touch her! I had to. She came between us. You're a maniac! You're a maniac! A bastard lunatic! There's lots of work to be done here. After what's happened... you must not walk alone at night. It's dangerous. The house is very big. I suggest you sleep here when it's necessary. I didn't mean to frighten you... I propose a toast. To your health. Forgive me. I'm sorry. I'm so clumsy. I'll wash them and bring them back tomorrow. Don't worry. Lanvin will make sure that I'm not put in danger. Inspector, I don't have your key here, you must have left it up in your room. Here. THE MAN WITH THE FACE OF WAX Who are you? What are you doing in my room? Let me through. I'm here to speak to one of the guests. - You noticed nothing strange? - No, nothing. He left his key in his room when he went out, which can happen. And I gave him a duplicate. I suppose no one called on him later? I'm grateful. Thanks. I'm here to see Inspector Lanvin. Did you know Inspector Lanvin? Tonight I'll take you to the new museum. Thank you. I feel terrified about Lanvin's death. That officer questioned me for an hour, but he didn't believe what I said. Why should he believe it? They didn't find anything which connects Boris with Lanvin's murder. Nevertheless, I know Lanvin was killed by Boris. Don't ask how, but I know it. It's irrational, Sonia. But I'm worried even so. Say there's truth in what you suspect. You're in terrible danger if there is. In any case, you mustn't go back to the museum. Go away just for a while. Andrea, what difference would that make? He must surely have guessed who I am, so I'm not safe anywhere. Just promise me that at least you won't set foot in the museum again. Those are veins! How can they be real veins? My God, they're corpses! Palazzi has to see them urgently. Hand them to him as soon as he gets here. - He can reach me at my office. - All right. Something's happened to her. You must find her. What time does she usually get home? She leaves the museum at eight, So she gets home at the latest by 8:30. Signora, we've met, I'm Andrea. Why are you here? What's happened? Sonia didn't come home last night. What do you want here at this hour? I want Sonia. Sonia's disappeared. Why come here to me? - I haven't seen her for days. - Hurt her and I swear I'll kill you! I'm not listening to this! Get out, or otherwise... Or what? You'll bring the police here? And maybe you'll explain why your wax models are actually human - corpses, and this is a morgue? - What nonsense. - What laughable nonsense. - That's a voice I'll never forget. I'd recognize it among a thousand. You are Volk! Volk Borisoff! You aren't mistaken? You're quite certain? I remember that voice and the pain it caused. Boris Volk. Don't touch me. Are you all right? - Sonia. Rescue Sonia. - I'll come back. How beautiful you are. You're as beautiful as your mother. Perhaps even lovelier. Once it was different. Even then my art was touched by genius. But now it has anew dimension. The world refused to recognize me then, now it will be forced to. My gentle sensitivity was mocked, despised as ineffectual weakness. People wanted only violence and terror. All right, I could give them that. No one has expressed pain and sorrow as I have done, because I carried a vast store inside me. That sorrow I bestow on the wax figures. And so in their moment of death I grant immortality. I honor those who, like me, were cast out by society, reviled by it. Go to her. See what she has been brought to. And now you are mine. Only mine, Marta. - Forever. - No. Look. I'll never let you hurt me again, like my father. You thought of me as your creature, but I am not. Burn! In hell. You'll have to try to get out through the exit at the far end. Let's go! Don't stop for anything. - Have to go that way. - If there's no choice, let's go now. Wait till they get the door open. Don't stop. Come on, quickly! Now or never. Come on, Sonia. Now, let's go. For God's sake, hurry! Hurry up! Come on! Come on! Shield your eyes and keep going. - Just keep going. - It's all right. Don't be frightened.
