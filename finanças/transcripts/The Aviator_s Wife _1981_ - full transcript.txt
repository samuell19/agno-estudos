He'll be busy; Saturday's his only free day, anyway She'll be out Take it or leave it Let me know by two o'clock It won't be easy, letting her know She's not on the phone and I shouldn't call her at the office I'll leave a note at her place saying I'll be in touch later Have you any paper? I've nothing to write on I'll see you at a quarter to two at the station buffet near the rue de Verdun exit... Don't be later than two Call me at the Hotel Rodin, 3616595. Christian Hold on, I'll let you in Come in. What's the matter? I didn't mean to wake you I won't be in Paris again for at least a month I meant to write to you, but it's difficult I'd betterjust tell you I'll be back, but I won't be seeing you Even if I could, neither of us would want it My wife's moving to Paris and... She's expecting a baby, so I'm going back to her We love each other Congratulations I'm sorry to tell you so... It's all right I'll get dressed. Close the window if you're cold Just sit down It's cold It'll warm up Did you do these? No, my little niece I thought maybe you did them as a child Mine disappeared long ago Sit down I must go. Can we meet at lunchtime? I have a hairdresser's appointment Just stay Walk with me to the office, if you have time Is it cold out? It's going to be a nice day, apart from some rain later Are you sure? I won't swear to the rain Have you had breakfast? No. I'll make coffee No, I'll do it This tap! You need a plumber The pipe needs renewing I know. You're in the way, standing there Anne, can I talk to you? I'd better go No, stay I'd like one last kiss What's the point? I can't leave you like this You've already left me Are you angry with me? Yes No. You're entitled to love whom you like No obligation to come and tell me You'd rather I'd written? Walked out without a word? Maybe I walked out on you. I really enjoyed my holiday Who were you with? No one you know; very good-looking and he loves me I'm glad for you, truly It's very sweet of you to pay a friendly call at seven a.m. I'd left you a note I'm always glad to see friends You're trembling Are you cold? Yes, you left the window open Yes, it's my fault Oh, come off it; stop that I still love you, you know Love me from afar, then I intend to I can love like that, too, you know; I needn't always be with someone Here, if you want to help... I like your place, but it's a pity there's no kitchen Who needs one? I have lunch near the office. Evenings I go out, or settle for a snack Don't fuss, Anne. It'll turn up If I don't find it now, I never will Try again, be systematic I already have What was it? 717? Sonnomateg? It's for you Who is it? Who's calling? Francois Hang up, say I'm at a meeting I'm afraid she's at a meeting How long? Hang up on him I marked it "pink file" and this is the only pink file there is Every time I come back from holiday I find the same mess She didn't even put it in my tray It's Francois again Hang up, I don't want to talk to him He'll only call back It's crowded I must go in half an hour I give up; you try It's a waste of time Time has flown today You seem on edge Do I look tired? Rather refreshed, I'd say Strange how that happens when you sleep badly But that's not it Guess who came to see me When? A Gruyere cheese sandwich, please Welsh rarebit and a salad for me The platter is good No, Welsh rarebit Can you bring the sandwich now? Don't wait for the Welsh rarebit Don't say that She'll take no notice Still, you needn't have said it Never mind, at least it calms me down Come on, guess who came to see me at seven this morning Who? A ghost from the past Christian? Were you expecting him? No, he was trying to leave a note and he woke me, that's all Is he here for long? He's leaving this afternoon He comes back in a month He's moving to Paris for good You must be pleased See how wrong you were to worry? His wife's coming, too She'll keep an eye on him I'm afraid so He wants her here She's having a baby, so I have to accept... fidelity and conjugal love Well, I no longer love him, if I ever did So that's all right You're not upset? Oh, no. I admit I was very close to tears this morning... seeing him so stern, almost pleased with himself Well, I was pleased, too - Good riddance - You felt he'd divorce? No, he never thought of marrying me If you love, you marry You always generalize Most people feel as I do I don't understand you You complain, yet you won't live with anyone Want this? I'm not hungry Loving doesn't mean living together Do you really believe the things you say? You're living in a dream world How can you keep a man if he isn't with you? I don't understand... or, rather, I understand all too well These guys claim to be madly in love... but go on living with their wives, getting them pregnant I'm marrying because I don't want that kind of disillusionment I found "being available" fun, too, going from man to man But you get older Speak for yourself. I'm not on the shelf yet Marriage is a beginning, not an end Some beginning, looking at your Jean-Pierre! - And what about Francois? - I'm not marrying Francois Well, to each his own But how can you love such different men... at the same time? Do you really think I'm looking for some particular type? What interests me isn't whether someone's tall, short, dark or fair It's on another level entirely So what has Francois got? The poor creep isn't everyone's idea of the ideal pick-up Talk of the devil! Am I intruding? No, I was just going - Me too, so the table's yours - I'm not hungry You can have my sandwich No, thanks Who told you I was here? No one, I tried all the cafes around here I must go, I'll be late at the hairdresser's I've something to tell you Some other time, and don't try to call me at the office I've found a plumber for you and I've got to let him know Another day won't matter But he's free tomorrow I must go to my mother's What can we do? Leave your keys with the concierge Fine. Goodbye Wait. I'd better be there myself No need to bother You know it's no bother I'll walk with you It's on my way Where are you going? The Metro, to meet my friend It's that way The Etoile station will do just as well I met my friend this morning, he told me about the plumber Hurry and say it's O.K. There's plenty of time I came because I know you don't like me calling you at the office For something like this, it's O.K. No, but I wanted to tell you... I came round at eight this morning; I saw you both leave I'll tell you about it, but not here, not right now It was a shock I'll tell you all about it I thought he'd gone He came back Believe me, there's nothing to worry about When can we talk about it? I don't know Tonight? I'm busy tonight Tomorrow? I'll be at my mother's Monday evening, then I'll be working Before that; it won't take hours I can't wait till Monday You shouldn't have spied, then! I was only doing you a favour Just trust me. Go away Are you seeing him tonight? Has he been in Paris long? Go away, or I'll make a scene Are you seeing him tonight? Stop getting at me! I think I've some rights in the matter If you don't trust me, go to hell! You said you wouldn't see him again! I did not. I said he'd gone It wasn't likely he'd come back, but he did When? You wouldn't ask if you felt anything for me Do you love him? Leave me alone; I'll stop seeing you if you go on like this Put yourself in my shoes Try putting yourself in mine; if you felt for me, you wouldn't ask If you want to know, he's leaving again this afternoon Are you happy now? Wait a second No. See you on Monday Have I kept you waiting long? It's settled: She's leaving the keys with the concierge You've got the address? That's it, then. I must go now Where's the Place des Fetes? It's the other way I don't want to go there, I just want to get my bearings It's easy enough Where are you headed? Well, I don't know the address You don't know, then Yes, someone drove me there; it's near a big avenue Plenty of those around here, all alike I'll find it. I have a good sense of direction I'd never have guessed I think it's this way Near the town hall? No need to walk, then; you could have stayed on the bus Follow me It's nicer in the park, it's such a lovely day Do you spend your time in parks? No, today's an exception For me, too. I'd be at school, but my teacher's on strike I didn't feel like staying indoors, so here I am with my books Can you work out of doors? I work best like that In buses, trains, parks... where it's noisy Some people study in cafes, but not me You're a student? Yes, I'm preparing for an exam, but I have to work for my living You're not working now? I work nights and sleep days You're not sleeping now I should be, but I was a bit on edge, so I couldn't And right now? I have this errand to do Where are you off to? It's this way you want to go Oh, do as you like Shall we sit down? What about your errand? There's no hurry. It's only three... no, half past three I'm going to sit, anyway All right, but not another word; I'm working So am I Common law Does that interest you? No, I'm not taking up law What about you? German It's my second language, after English I also do Latin. Did you do German? No; I hear it's difficult Not if you know some Latin We weren't to talk - Not reading? - How about you? - I can look up, can't I? - So can I - What are you looking at? - And you? I'm looking at you looking. - What are you looking at? - Nothing. It's my lookout, anyway No, it affects my outlook It's not polite when you're talking to someone I wasn't talking, you said not to So let's both shut up I think you've been watching those two since the bus Which two? You know very well Don't point at them Just let them be You're following them I know you're following them! Quiet, they'll hear you So far away? So what, if you're not following them? I just don't want them to think I am Why on earth should they? Please don't Let's move on No, let's stay Frightened? I don't like feeling ridiculous But if you don't know them... Now listen I am following them, if you want to know Are you a detective? No... well, yes, in a way In the police? No, private... private eye stuff With an agency? Yes, I do enquiries for husbands who suspect their wives What an exciting job But you told me that you worked at night We have no set hours - So she's with her boyfriend? - That's a professional secret They're not being very amorous I have an idea they suspect you're following them You think so? Yes, I think you need further training You shouldn't confide in a stranger What if I told them who you are? You wouldn't. Why would you do that? To make trouble for you I don't like cops I'm no cop What harm has that woman done, anyway? It's her life I'm going to tell them Let me go! I'll scream! Stop it, they'll hear you To hell with it, I'm off! If you could see your face! I wasn't really going to tell them I don't think they've spotted us Would be sacked if they had? Would the agency sack you? All right, I lied to you I'm no detective I knew it was just a dodge for picking up girls That's why I teased you Picking up girls isn't my style, especially not today You want to know? I'm following them, but I'm no detective What are you, then? Nothing The man is someone I know; a friend of my girl A friend or a lover? Ex-lover; I thought they'd broken off And now you don't? I have no idea What a super story! Tell me more, it's most interesting That's all Does he know you? Of course not... I hope But you know him? Just by sight; if it is him You're not sure? Yes, it's him, it must be I don't understand. Did you follow him from his place, or what? No, the extraordinary thing is that I spotted him in a cafe So? I see lots of people I know in cafes Yes, but I'd already seen him elsewhere this morning And you'll see him again; misfortunes come in threes - Don't talk of misfortune - Why, would you kill him? Beware! What are you going to do, though? Nothing What's the point of following them, then? None, really I just needed to find something to do this afternoon So when I saw them leave the cafe, I left too, following automatically and got on the same bus And automatically picked me up That was a purely accidental encounter All right, but what are you going to do? Nothing, I tell you; there's no point Will you tell your girl? No, the situation is bad enough as it is She wouldn't believe me, because he was supposed... to leave Paris this afternoon At what time? I don't know The afternoon isn't over yet The ideal thing would be a photograph Brilliant! I'll borrow their camera and be right back Press this and the picture comes out there The light is lovely today I'd like that tree in the photo; it's my tree fetish Failed She probably felt them out, except for a wisp of hair She probably felt they spoiled the picture Well, what do I care? I've got a nice photograph You want it? Well, you're not getting it I don't give my picture to just any old wolf - I'm not a wolf - Oh, that yarn about your girl! Don't kid me that any girl could love you and that guy He's not bad; I had a good look He's as much like you as that duck is like an orang-outang That's what amazes me You mean you wouldn't be amazed if he looked like you? It would sadden me This saddens me, but it amazes me as well They don't go together at all... and she told me she didn't love him What a woman says... Maybe my problems bore you? Not at all, you amuse me You think I'm ridiculous? Yes, people wrapped up in their own problems always seem so You mustn't mind that Is she pretty? Who? My girl? Yes, very Prettier than her? They're different You won't find ten like her in Paris Well, a hundred Even a thousand would be something Like to see her picture? Yes, she's lovely Her eyes are lovely, but so sad Is she sad? Not really It just looks that way in photographs Actually, she's quite cheerful. She laughs a lot As much as me? Well, it's different She's twenty-five - You're younger, aren't you? - Quite a bit; I'm twenty I'm fifteen So I'm half-way between you Have you a boyfriend? Who is he? The Prince of Corregidor, waiting to carry me his castles in Spain No, he's a road-sweeper I don't want to talk about it. I haven't one, anyway I'm only fifteen, sir Have you a picture? Of my boyfriend? No picture and no boyfriend I bet you have one in your satchel I told you, he's a road-sweeper, black and the Moslem religion... forbids the taking of pictures I told you about mine You telling me your life story... doesn't mean I must tell you mine If my boy cheated on me, I'd keep my sorrow to myself And I wouldn't follow him about Or the girl with whom he... Anyway, you're spinning yarns No, that's how it is; I can hardly believe it myself You're beginning to make me wonder whether I'm awake or dreaming - You're dreaming - Could be No, I mean you're dreaming up a movie about a total stranger I tell you it's him, but it doesn't really matter if it isn't I felt like walking It gave me a purpose; then when I met you... That gave you another purpose Well, it did me good to talk. Also... It's strange. I hardly know you, yet I can talk to you I've never talked about my troubles before I don't know what's got into me Lack of sleep, probably Do you believe me? What difference does it make? I'm sure there's truth in what you say, but you tell a good story, too So do I, but only to people who don't Some talk and others listen They've gone Here they are, they're coming Pretend to be talking. What can we talk about? Spin me another yarn What I told you was 100% true 50%. Didn't you invent anything? Yes, you did Not so loud; talk naturally It's you who's not acting natural It's your conspiratorial air that makes us conspicuous - German is easy, you were saying - For me, anyway Listen. My teacher says I have a very good accent He looked at us - I'm off - Let them get ahead But we've been spotted... - He looked at you - I was bawling in German! What did it mean? No idea. He likely doesn't know German He's from Alsace Well, it was a private conversation Verheiratet... I really don't know They can't have gone beyond the second floor. What's his name? Schlosser He's a pilot... doesn't live in Paris Who are you looking for? Schlosser Not here A tall, thin man; an airline pilot No pilots here He knows a lady who lives here... blonde hair, cut short What's her name? I don't know, but theyjust went up together She had a blue mac and a flowery scarf I didn't see them What do you want with her? She lost something? Yes, well, no. Not her exactly I'm looking for a girl of my age; we swopped macs by mistake at the swimming-pool. I don't know her, but she was seen with this lady I can't think of anyone That's her mac you're wearing? That's right I don't recognize it For sailing, is it? That's right. Do you go sailing? No. A blonde? Not a redhead, by any chance? Well, darkish... I think we must have made a mistake Why tell her all that stuff? To gain her confidence We might have got somewhere, but it was no use... with you looking so shifty He could have come down any minute Well, what now? I'm off Don't spoil it now that it's getting really thrilling What's thrilling about it? I'm for the bus I'm thirsty, let's go to that cafe We might see them come out You can do your detecting and follow them I have to go at five We can watch from here Well, now... What is your theory? I have no theory I have What would Sherlock Holmes have done? That's fiction; this is real life Personally, I like life when it's most like a novel What would Sherlock do? Stupid stuff with his lens, looking for fingerprints Not in this case. He'd have deduced So have I, and I have a theory What is it? Guess. Deduce We've no facts We've plenty First fact: They don't live there, either of them True, and in fact I've an idea about where they went The lawyer's office Clever Mr. Detective I'm not a complete fool I'm surprised they didn't have to check with the concierge There was a name-plate I feel they've been there before I don't know, but... Yes, they knew the building What do you deduce from that? Why a lawyer? There could be hundreds of reasons Not that many, and as far as you are concerned... one seems very likely; certain, in fact As far as I'm concerned? Well, your girl, really What do lawyers handle a lot of? Divorce They were simply going to get a divorce You mean he's going to marry the blonde? Good luck to him You've got it wrong The blonde is his wife Hence the glum looks Hold on A man and his wife couldn't go to the same lawyer Why not, if it's amicable? My parents did, it's fashionable What are you thinking? If he were married, Anne would have told me Are you sure? Anyway, he may never have told her That's possible; travelling around you can get away with anything Would she lie to you? Anne? Why should she? She's been very frank about him Don't make me laugh Some things the sincerest woman won't tell She didn't tell you he was back; you found out, didn't you? I don't know What do you mean: You don't know? You know she lied, don't you? How do you like my theory? You're romancing Not entirely If I were, you wouldn't care, but you've gone all pensive I think it's fun Rather stimulating, in fact I was a bit down in the dumps You were? Why? Just because; no particular reason But also for very specific reasons Can't I have problems, too? Amorous problems? You're very inquisitive, sir What's your name, by the way? Francois. What's yours? Lucie. Let's call a truce You've been asleep for ten minutes You're lucky I've been keeping watch I'll drink my coffee; that'll wake me up How come you know him, but... he doesn't know you? You still don't believe me I do. I was just asking I happened to see him in the street with Anne But didn't get a good look? Good enough. He was so engrossed in her that I'd plenty of time You like spying No, I wondered who he was... her ex, as she hadn't been seeing him So she says Are you sure you saw them together this morning? Where? I might as well tell you everything: I work some nights at a post office - Which post office? - At the Gare de I'Est You know it? Sure. In fact... We might have met on my way to school I'm at home asleep by that time Oh, yes. What are you saying? I was saying I was too kind-hearted. Anne needed a plumber I found someone, brother of a friend who works at the post office I went to Anne's at seven, to put a note under her door And walked in on them? No, but I did see them leave the house at eight - They didn't see you? - Of course not Poor thing, what a shock for you I wouldn't like that What did you do? Nothing; they were some way away What now? Not going to kill him, are you? People do... but I bet she's the one you want to pop off Neither She's the one... how cowardly I'd be honourable and kill my rival I don't want to kill anyone I'd understand, but she didn't love him Some girls are like that: Love one, love'em all For me, though, it's all or nothing Same here Yet you put up with that guy I don't; I thought it was all over, or I'd never have tried to see her Suppose she won't choose between you? Well, we'll see what happens Poor old Francois is in a stew His honey's moved to pastures new Reaching higher with a flyer Stop it Why? I have a gift for poetry If I were you, I'd pack in that bird. She doesn't sound much You've had it, anyway, if she's had enough; women do the deciding I chose her. I had my eye on her before she saw me A man gets the girl he has his eye on only ifshe chooses him She picked a replacement because her guy was away - Am I being rough? - I chose her! I don't like being chosen Too bad; girls know what they want I don't think Anne does She does, though she may not find it And she knows it's not you What do you know about it? I told you only what I wanted to We agree on some things, but it's superficial I think Anne and I have a deeper relationship It's him she loves She doesn't love him She doesn't love you Stop talking nonsense You told me so Well, I'm telling you different Don't get excited; I was only joking She loves you. There! Sure she loves you Even well-matched couples don't seem so to me, so maybe you are I must go Where? To the Metro I'll go with you Don't be silly, they might come out any minute You can follow them They spotted me, anyway And what if they separate? Then you could use help But my grandmother is expecting me Still, I'd like to know if my theory is correct Something will happen to prove it one way or the other I'll give you my address; you can send me a report - Nothing's going to happen - Then report that Have you any paper? Yes, hold on No phone number; mother would object Lucie Lavalette 15 Avenue de Verdun Avenue de Verdun? That's close to where I work Just put it through the letter-box; it'll save you a stamp Promise not to forget? You owe me that for my services And don't go to sleep again Serge, I've had a terrible job getting hold of you I've been trying to get you all afternoon About tonight, I'm rather tired Not ill, just tired The girl who filled in while I was on holiday messed up the filing. I've spent the afternoon hunting for things I've always said you take yourjob too seriously One has to Going out will cheer you up Why not come? All right, maybe it will relax me a bit But I'm tired... I'd like to rest a little first Could we meet at eight-thirty? We won't have time to talk before the show, and you'll leave after Sorry, but I don't feel much like talking tonight All right, I'll see you then Do I look as if I'd been to the hairdresser's? Not a bit I can't understand it Other girls look splendid after the hairdresser; I look just the same Well, you don't look as if you're going to the hairdresser That's true It's not still raining, is it? See you on Monday I hear you're getting married To a super airline pilot, so I'm told I approve the pilot, because then... I'll be able to come and see you Who is it? Me This isn't nice of you I said I wouldn't be in - But you are - I'm resting Come in, since you're here I'm not going to kill you, you know I just didn't want you to think that I'm jealous I can respect your feelings for him Poor Francois You see, Christian... No, it's the way you spoke to me But that's not what I came to say Not on my bed, say it from over there What is it? Why so angry? I just can't stand your lamentations now, that's all I'm not lamenting O.K., I'll go Yes, be nice for once. I need to rest before I go out You want to sleep? Just to rest. Sorry, but we're both on edge See you on Monday I'll come tomorrow morning No, you need sleep How do you know? It's obvious Don't go tomorrow I have to see mother Please, this once Would you go if you were married? - With or without husband? - I'm not married or planning to be See you on Monday This can't go on. I'll transfer to the day shift Starting next week What about your classes? At least I'd see you If you're doing this to provoke me, I'll stop seeing you I can't go on like this - It's no life - For you it is I feel responsible for you If you give up your studies I'll stop seeing you - That's blackmail! - You're the blackmailer For your sake I hope you'll change your mind For goodness sake go or stay; I hate you hanging over me One kiss No, if I give an inch... I'm in horrible mood, you know And I deserve an explanation, you know Of what? I don't owe you any explanations Even if I were your wife, I'd refuse I've a perfect right to see who I like whenever I like You come here at ungodly hours You pester me on the phone You turn up at lunch and nearly make me late Now I'm trying to rest and you walk in Think of others sometimes; you're not the only one with problems You always want to decide things; give me a little time How can you do this to me? If you'd let me talk... You've done nothing but talk, but you don't say anything I'm saying I love you Your attitude grieves me All that's wrong with my attitude is that I shouldn't have let you in Think of me a little, instead of being sarcastic Think of me Making scenes won't get you anywhere You would turn anyone against you You make me laugh Listen, Anne... What? It's quite natural... What? Fussing about nothing Nothing? Really? Maybe not, from the way you go on about it - Listen, Anne - Is that all you can say? Just listen, for God's sake You really hurt me I can do it myself Think less about me and more about your position All right We can't go on like this; it's no good for either of us Try to live your own life instead of getting wrong ideas about us It's just that I like being with you So either I work nights and you spend yours as you like... or I can go on days and we could live like a normal couple Perfectly normal, even down to arguments - Normal couples live together - That's out of the question If you want to live with a girl, find someone else, not me I tried it for three years Not again, not just now When, then? I don't know Probably never Won't you ever marry? I'm not planning to Even then, you don't have to live together You do. The law stipulates a marital home Well, they won't jail me for not living with my husband He could divorce you I'll find someone who won't - He'll have to be rich - Why? Two small apartments cost no more than a big one I like this place of mine I won't give it up to share a luxury apartment Even if you love the guy? That's immaterial For me, love isn't cohabitation; I hate anything clinging It's absurd, because here I am with the most clinging guy in the world Today, maybe; but some days we hardly see each other That's how it should be; absence makes the heart grow fonder So why see each other? Understand one thing, Francois If you were free every night, we'd have parted already Because I know you: You'd have wanted to move in Since it's occasional, I tolerate you Rejoice, though No one else has been in this bed No one? I used to go to Christian's hotel You'll say I'm spying, but last night... If you spy, do the job properly You didn't see him arrive, did you? He came to see me at seven a.m. He must be crazy You came then, too To leave a note Him, too But I heard him as he was leaving and I invited him in We had a quick breakfast; he hates me to be late If he's coming every day, he ought to get a car Are you seeing him tonight? No, he went back to Frankfurt When? This afternoon When are you seeing him? So don't tell me Poor Francois You can't imagine, wrapped up in your own little problems... that I could possibly have any You're so sad, so angry, so upset, yet what's happened to you? Nothing serious Your girl has remained true to you, sleeping soundly in her own bed She's the one to despair Yet instead of comforting her in her misery, you insult her And you say you love me What did he do to you? What did he do? He said a last goodbye He ditched you? In favour of his wife You didn't say he was married It didn't matter, or so I thought He said they were separated, but she's expecting a baby Since when? What difference does it make? He won't see you again? Neither should you I don't like him doing that to me... after vanishing for three months I don't like you making a fuss into the bargain Or that cretin Marcillac babbling to me on the bus home And tonight... why didn't I refuse to go out with Carrere? I'm much too nice I spend my life doing things I don't have to It's so pitiful that it's laughable Aren't you laughing? I'd like to be alone for a bit Francois... don't go Stay It's all right, Anne, I'm here I'm sick of it all Lie down I must look a fright You look lovely You'll be late for your date I don't care Actually, I set the alarm for seven-thirty I'll stay with you anyway I can say that I'm sick No, I can't get out of my date Carrere isn't much fun, but at least he isn't after me Why he takes me out... He likes to be seen with a pretty girl But we never see anyone Why do you go? Not just because he invites me It's nice to go out sometimes with someone who isn't really after me It seems there aren't many women after him, so it's something You know, he gets nothing out of me at all To someone not very attractive... your presence is something... enough to make me jealous You'd be jealous of my dentist, if I'd one A real man-eater, aren't I? Not in the least You're so sweet Why did I play you up like that? I think it calmed me down And that's the end of Christian Do you love him? No Did you love him? - Not really - You had every right to Everything is my right and it's not up to you to judge me I was in love with him, full of crazy ideas I imagined he'd come back... and carry me off like Prince Charming I cherished the idea, even if I didn't really believe or want it I can understand your being sad, because I am, too Then this morning... the fairy-tale of my dreams came true The note under my door. Then him The dream in flesh and blood Simply to say: "I love my wife" What I don't understand is why he disappeared... why he waited three months to come and tell you I don't know Reconciliations take their time, I suppose He was switched to another route, too, away from Paris Next month he'll be with his old flight and with his wife Two girls in the same city simply isn't on - She's quite pretty, you know... - His wife? Do I know her? No, but I've a picture Show me He wasn't keen on me having this photo; I couldn't understand why This morning he told me it was her in it, there on the right She's very different from you You think so? Yes, even if you bleached your hair She's on the extreme right, not on his right In green? Who's the blonde, then? I don't know You're sure that's her? Yes, why all the questions? You'd make a good cop Or maybe not: You always miss the point He could tell you anything and you'd have no way of proving it So what, since he's ditching me I'd be more inclined to blame him for being hurtful He always puts things so bluntly He could have let me down lightly But he spun a yarn about a lawsuit with his sister He's suing his sister? No, they're suing somebody. Why? No reason What are you thinking about? Nothing You're brooding over something - What is it? - Nothing important What is it? Don't you ever think of nothing? I'm always thinking something That something being nothing What is it? Stop needling me If you talk about something you give it importance it doesn't have You see, this afternoon... I couldn't sleep, so I went for a walk and... And what? Nothing. I was just thinking... About you, him, making up stories Imagining him carrying me off to the South Seas Something like that What else? I forget Really? Thinking the kind of thoughts... you have when you're unhappy... and jealous, too You started to tell me something, then stopped. What? I've told you Come on, tell me what it was Do you really want to know? I picked up a girl in the park You waste no time, do you? Incredible! They say women act up Yet here you come weeping in my arms, claiming I've deserted you No, it was she who picked me up, thinking I was following her Weren't you? Of course not That's the last thing I'd been thinking of Why? There's plenty of fish... No, what I was thinking was that I wasn't interested... in anyone but you Which didn't stop you from talking to her Was she pretty? Don't tell me you didn't notice It's not the same thing; she was just a kid of fifteen She was skipping classes She was rather fun, actually Ah, rather fun, whereas I'm no fun at all I'm too old for you Get yourself another girl; go and find your little bird She doesn't interest me She ought to - Did you make a date? - No Have you her phone number? Just her address Will you write to her? Are you crazy? Are you jealous? Me, jealous? If that's what you wanted, you're going the wrong way about it I was just trying to be honest I didn't have to tell you about her. She means nothing to me I was upset and it was someone to talk to What did you talk about? Nothing much, this and that The weather? No fear! Love? No, well, just in general May I hear what she thought? Just kid stuff, really Oh yes? Such as? I don't know... well... that girls do the deciding Do you believe that? I don't believe it, either I'd like to You decide too much Me? No, I don't I can't even decide to put you out Well, I'm off Have you eaten? No, I'll get a sandwich Take some grapes Well, I'm ready Like that? Why not? I do hate leaving you, knowing you're going out with someone else He's harmless Yes, but he'll be with you, I won't See you on Monday Right, six o'clock And Francois, don't forget to write to your little friend A long letter, she'll love that They did go to the lawyer's, but the woman was his sister. We never thought of that See you sometime. Francois Paris has charmed me Paris has conquered me Paris took me in her arms sensuously She swallowed me up in her feverish hustle and bustle In her restless frenzy And I felt caught up, wrapped up Sucked up and stifled A small spot lost in the immensity I count about as much as a cobblestone A plane tree leaf flying on the avenue That will tumble down the stairs of the metro Instead of soaring up to the sun Way up there Paris has charmed me Paris disarmed me Turning all my hopes to alarms I live alone under my garret roof From friends and strangers I remain aloof Yet still I feel proud of my solitude As on the hardships of life I brood Life in the city so vast and wide Constantly buffeted by wind and tide It's a struggle for survival renewed each day With cruel destiny refusing to point the way Now the dark and malevolent night Drives all ease from anguished sight And muffled roars still prowl the street For the heart of Paris never ceases to beat Subtitles processed by: C.M.C. - Paris
