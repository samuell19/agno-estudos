Sir.. those thieves burgled his house.. how can these Police protect us? they were careless when there was burglary in the town.. but when it came to them, they feel the pinch.. this is fate of the police of our town.. Sir.. hmm.. Mr. Mani, this is fifth theft, including our house's. not even a single clue.. This.. do you know any other details, except those in FIR? Sir.. it seems, those thieves are not from this town. hmm. because, they are stealing after neat planning, to the extent that, after the theft, only next morning, one will know about the theft in that house. hmm. very much planned.. That means, about the house, about the household, they know much details means, they are from this town only. since they have collected so much details, they are close to the people of this town. For example, salesmen, Salesmen roam around the town. They go door to door, talk to the household, nobody will doubt them. But.. salesmen in this town, I don't think so. They are wearing different masks. What you mean, Sir? may be, a vegetable vendor, flower, fruit, sweetmeat, candy, could be fish seller.. If you think of the service oriented, the postman, or the one who lays cable, linemen.. I think, these people are amidst us, wearing such masks. Sir, one who goes around and sells, in this town is, fish seller our Naga only Sir. But he is very good man, Sir. Daily on his way, he comes here and goes Sir. He need be the one.. I have given an example, that is all. Okay.. bring that land grabbing case file. Okay Sir, I'll bring.. You.. Naga, SI's house, little heavy.. and he is new SI too.. we don't know his background.. I think it is better to keep away for few days.. What if he is new or old? Didn't Srikrishna himself said it? You do your work.. don't covet the rewards.. Look.. if we do our work properly, nobody can do anything. The poor SI, must be knowing us properly by this time. Five seven seven four three two Five seven seven four Our next target is inside this.. Mani.. Sir.. Next theft will take place in three km. surrounding, from our house.. I want details of all the houses in three km. radius. Okay Sir.. Why are you so angry, Sahib? Is it because, there was theft on first day itself? Not that theft was on first day, first day, at Police's house.. that too, my house is burgled.. dear, don't bother too much.. You will definitely catch those thieves.. Don't stress yourself.. Your chain also has gone, isn't it? My dignity has gone.. Come for dinner.. Shekhar, bring the file.. Yes Sir.. hmm.. Hello, Manianna, Hello, Take.. Why Naga, last 2 -3 days you have not come.. Not getting fish at all Maniyanna.. By the way.. It seems new Sahib has come? yes.. Introduce him.. Now he is in tension.. You leave now.. I'll introduce him on some other day.. Do you say so? Yes Shall I leave then? Okay.. Sir.. There should be close monitoring on all these areas from tomorrow.. If you see any suspicious people, keep an eye on them.. Okay Sir.. Hmm. Hello Shekharanna.. How come you are here? Shampoo.. Okay, move on.. Hmm.. Hello Maniyanna, not be seen.. Hello, How come you are here? Just to have tea.. Are you okay? A tree fell down yesterday, isn't it? Ya, it fell down just nearby.. Oh, you came to cut that tree, is it? Yes, same tree.. Malli, please stay outside for five minutes.. Next theft will be at one among these nine houses.. If you observe the characteristics of these nine houses, there are dogs in first three houses. They will not go there.. Fourth and fifth are in same compound.. joint family.. They will not go to crowded place.. Bachelors stay in sixth house, no use going there.. Seventh house has electric fencing.. Eighth house has CC TV camera.. Will not show courage to go.. Remaining is ninth house.. At the outskirts of the town, areca nut trader's Here.. our next game.. Only two live here.. Not only that, they are aged.. Old fashioned house.. there will be less security getting inside and coming out, is as easy as the flick of a finger.. But, won't the Policemen be roaming there? Isn't it their duty? How can you say, this is the house? To catch the thieves, you should walk in their path.. To avoid Police watching on the way we walk, we should not leave even a single clue Daily let there be two men on beat, Let Kishor watch the other houses. And.. I should talk to that household. Right away, let me come to the point.. hmm We doubt that, there is every possibility of theft in your house. so I am giving Police protection to your house from today. Even then, keep in safe custody of the jewels, cash and any other valuables.. and, if something happens around your house, or.. suspect anything that happens here, you call me immediately to this number.

Who, that Naga.. Don't know Sir.. Can we leave Sir? Go.. I'll call you later.. Okay Sir.. Grandpa can't see.. but he can hear properly.. When you talk, talk in different voice.. But to Malli.. She can see, can listen.. none of us should be seen to her.. Aye.. hmma? Sir.. Have you changed your voice while speaking? No Sir.. No Sir.. No Thank you for coming Officers.. Hello Sir.. It is a very informal meeting.. That is why I informed this in a short notice.. You Came.. thanks again.. Straight away let me come to the point.. Case number 18.. Only Police Officers' wives are murdered. To tell that, we are those Police Officers, I feel traumatic and angry, both.. Sir, My wife is also murdered.. Why did I call you here because, don't know how many more murders will take place.. before that we should stop the killer.. before stopping, we have to catch him, isn't it Sir? How to search him? Before searching him, we should know his state of mind. As per my analysis, in psycho killers there are two categories First.. During murder when the victim groans the sadistic pleasure the killer gets, that is, murder for adrenaline rush.. Second category popularity.. killing one after other, posing it as the achievement signature, making people to scare.. enjoying the popularity of that scare. But this killer, belongs to neither of the categories. He is not a psychopath. No Sir, He murders only ladies. He is a psychopath. They were all helpless.. those who died are all women.. but I seriously doubt if he is a psychopath.. He hasn't tortured anybody.. Look here.. there is no bloodshed in any murder.. there is no bloodshed.. they were all dead before they realise.. quick deaths.. no sir.. killer has left his signature at all places.. he wants to be popular.. You should frighten people, to become popular, to frighten, you should murder one after other.. look at the dates of the murder.. in 2015, one murder takes place and in 2018 it is two.. and now another.. there is no uniformity or patterns in this. with sufficient time and meticulous planning each murder is.. a perfect crime, without any clue.. he is not a psycho killer.. he is a murderer, who, in the guise of psycho killer, misleads us.. this is some revenge against us.. Did you come to that point by seeing this Karma symbol Sir? that is neither symbol, nor signature.. he is telling us something.. What is he telling in that Sir..? Karma means.. our acts, whether good or bad, will follow us. exactly.. only bad incidents follow us here.. we did something wrong.. Police wants to enquire us again means.. they doubt us.. What shall we do? shall we leave the town? Naga,? hmm.. let's do one thing.. Let us search Naga.. hma.. You search inside the town.. I'll search outside the town.. Okay.. after the dusk come out of the town.. hma.. I'll come and meet you there.. Hma.. stop.. Okay, you go.. what is our wrong doing Sir? If we do something wrong, the bad will follow us.. But we haven't done anything wrong.. Why he is targeting us? Let me explain.. He murdered everybody by fracturing cervical area. that means.. he murdered everybody by breaking neck bone.. why only that..? why should he murder in same pattern? There is a message.. may be a very emotional one.. if at all, he had problem in cervical area, either he would be bedridden, or dead.. So it is very clear that, he is not the victim.. victim may be somebody who is very close to him.. son, daughter, father, mother.. anybody can be.. that brings me back to us again.. All those dead are Police Officers' wives.. He has lost his wife.. must have died like this.. to be precise.. died by us.. But what I don't understand is, none of us are.. known to each other.. even then his targets are not our wives.. We.. I am sure there are some details hidden within us.. to every question, we are searching for. we are the answers.. Sir, we are not batch mates.. nor worked for a case together.. when we all met, for me, impossible to remember.. Because, we get thousands of duties from the Governament.. The Ganapati festival, the curfew.. the school duty, election duty..this that and all.. remembering all those, it is quite impossible.. He is telling us something.. this is a revenge on us.. before searching him,, we should know his state of mind.. all those who died are women.. he hasn't tortured anybody to kill.. no bloodshed at all.. Seena.. Seena.. Seena.. Seena.. Seena.. Maniyanna.. oh, you came..! hmm hmm Shekhar, hmm? see that 602 file.. Okay.. Maniyanna, Will you give me 3000? Why Shekhar? hmm.. You know our staff Kamala, hmma.. It seems she has some problem in pregnancy.. Her husband had come.. is it? 3000? okay..will give.. there is no problem in giving,.. But her husband is a drunkard.. in the name of wife's pragnancy.. if he spends whatever he has? He was not drunk when he came.. I too haven't seen,, just heard that he is drinking.. I'll give money, no problem.. Kamala is working with us.. Sir.. my wife is pregnant Sir.. she has no siblings.. Let us help in this difficult times of her pragnancy and mernity days.. Maniayanna, I will do this.. You give me 3000, I will add 2000, and go to her with my wife and hand over it.. The school duty.. the election duty.. this and that.. it is impossible to remember all those Sir.. Okay.. Don't go empty handed. Buy some fruits and go.. Take the money.. it is 3500.. Okay Brother.. how will she complete her meternity, without anybody's help.. nobody knows her pragnancy desires.. whatever.. let good prevail.. Seena.. Seena.. Seena.. Naga.. hmma.. aye.. What are you doing in inspector's house? I will tell you all that later.. drill the wall first.. Aye.. The wall looks cracked. kick, kick in force.. will fall.. Is it? Yes.. Then wait.. hmm.. Hello.. SI Seetaram, from Anegadde Police station here, Can I get an information? hmm.. During the 2014 March general election, in your jurisdiction.. is there any record of a death by cervical fracture? hmm.. Give me some time Sir.. I have to check the files and tell you Sir. Sure, thank you.. Hello.. Hello Sir.. There was death Sir.. Is it? Hmm..Is it a lady? Hmm.. Yes Sir.. that too a pregnant lady Oh God.. Name? Reeta George.. wife of Benoy George.. Benoy George.. any suspects..? No sir.. it is death by slipping.. no suspect Sir.. Okay, thank you.. you.. Can you mail me the copies of FIR and Benoy George photo..? Okay Sir.. thank you.. Kick..kick.. Kick..kick.. it is leaning towards this side.. kick.. falling.. wallop.. above.. falling.. wallop by force.. It is falling.. only Police Officer's wives are killed.. that is neither symbol nor signature.. he is telling us something.. Benoy.. Why did he kill Deva? what is the connection? Hello, SI Seetaram again.. In 2014.. were thefts registered of same pattern? hmm.. 2014 -15.. I have to see the file again Sir.. But.. 4 -5 years back, there were 5 - 6 robberies Sir.. Suddenly stopped Sir.. robbery was in such a way that.. after the robbery, only next morning you will know that in that house.. there was a theft. except that, no other details Sir.. Sorry..
