It's hard to be 11 years there is so much that you do not understand Why go all the adults around and looks as if everything hurts when I bli'r great and I'll get 'it sjovt and I know who I should ask permission this is a guy who never says no he called Crumb and it's me when you have school and family and friends and a little love it is not so highly when you first get it learned to do what you want and then count to ten and then you get everything you ka 'li' it is not so highly when you first get it learned to do what you want and then count to ten and then you get everything you ka 'li' many men who have been really big ' have been as small brother Robin Hood, he was a little dreng but it means nothing for you grow like trees and flowers and suddenly you are 100 years it is not so highly when you first get it learned to do what you want and then count to ten ... It's not that hard on a lovely morning when the bell is only 7.43. Mornings are okay, even if they are early in the day. Our family has agreed to get up early and enjoy ourselves. It's dad's idea. Morning, Krumme. Stine, I'm going to the toilet now. Yes, yes, father. May I just finish? Dad says you have to start the day well. Opens not you blow me the door. It takes longer, if you shout. My sister spend a long time to lubricate things in the head - - and howls she unrequited love. She is in a difficult age. I move, if you do not respect my personal integrity. - I shaved now. - You should have thought about before. Father's woodwork teacher. He's constantly ideas for new projects. He made everything, we lived in a copy of Stine's dollhouse. You've changed since you went to the toilet two hours ago. - Who invited you here? - Stine ... This small table ... - You stand it apart. - No no. I do not understand it with Stine and love. She chased Per for months. She has eaten nothing of sorrow, and now she's got him - - but do not eat, because he does not like fat girls. She mixes things up. Little brother called Grunk. He's having fun in its own way. Unfortunately pollute the part. - Morning, Krumme. - Good morning, Mom. Come, brush. Mother also think you have to enjoy themselves in the morning. She works in a kindergarten and studying for exams. We must all be quiet when she read about difficult children. Grunk would be difficult, but it discovers mother. You should write a book about Grunk and put it in her bag. ... the time has been 7:45. Father and mother love each other, but dad says - - that love moves into the abdomen with age. - Left or right? - Two pieces of sugar, please. What a lot of love. - I am going the way around you. - Yes Yes. - What is it? - Whipped cream from my Irish Coffee. Irish ... With so much love he had to run in the morning. Below us live Mrs. Olsen. She thinks we make noise - - and banks always to the ceiling with her broom. - What happens? - It was just your man who toppled. Jens? Remember, it's your turn to cook. And and. So we shell have cholesterol bomb. - And what is that? - Meatballs. It was a good idea, Stine. Meatballs with gravy. In the morning, we get up early and enjoy ourselves. It is important to have a good start to the day. No, you know now what ... you must take care of my notebooks. I gotta hand it to the kids. I can not deliver something. - Crumb, you with, I run now. - I go. It's just because you want to go with Yrsa, not too little crooked? It's weird with sisters. Because you are in the family - - they think you have generated around the clock. Girls! Yes, but we are not to live without. Others would now run after her, but not me. Pretend nothing and hope - - she gets run over by a steamroller or eaten by a shark. Now I think soon, the beautiful is coming. - Shut up, you big idiot! - Yrsa and Crumb! Yrsa and Crumb! - Stop it! Are you insane? - Come on, damn it! - Mrs. Olsen turns sour. - Keep looking up, Crooked! Stop it! ... then we say that the time is 7:47. - Who has destroyed my table? - Has anyone broken your toys? Stine, it was probably me. I came to put me on it. - But I make a new one. - It was my only happy memory. - What a pity for small Stine. - I'm not coming home more! Then I read the newspaper on the toilet every morning. Stine is a difficult age. A 14-year-old girl is in identity crisis. - She has been in 14 years. - I must leave! - Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five ... - Where are my keys? Nobody leaves the room before I found my keys. Thank you, Crooked. Remember Grunk. Here. How ... And your lunch! Do not buy half a kilo of minced for meatballs? Crooked, you can not download the book I ordered from the bookstore? "Young children's well-being and upbringing." And remember to download Grunk in the nursery. Grunk! Good morning, Mrs. Olsen. Grunk! Come on, honey. Dav, Svendsen. Krumborg, you could not help but to park right here? You know, it is not allowed. I would like to sweep. But I'm running well now, Svendsen. Are you ready, Grunk? Should he be given special treatment? You know what ... - Is there trouble with the electric? - No no. I'm home at five o'clock. Remember to download Grunk. Good morning, Mrs. Olsen. What have you done to your hair? Grunk! Have a good day. Half a kilo notch to meatballs. "Young children's well-being and growth" to the mother. Downloading Grunk. - By my fod! - Hey, Yrsa. - Hi. - Did you lose your bag? - I wanted to see if I had everything with. - You as a banana. Yes, I was expecting to meet a monkey on the way to school. - What are you doing? - Crumb has just broken head. - Do not you think he so stupid? - Girls! - Hello, girls. - Hello Hans. - Should I take your bag, Yrsa? - We have gymnastics today. I hate Hansel and boiled cod. I can only tell the difference because Hans has a bicycle. There are Overkrummen. He's out and vent his Russian-Mercedes. - Where do you think you're going? - Your dad's beard to make joke with. Shut your mouth. I must be a good example, because the father is a teacher at the school. He could be a good example for the teachers. For Mr. Jansen. Good morning, my ladies and gentlemen. Step closer. Groundhog Day. Krumborg! Krumborg! I wish he would buy a belt. - Krumborg have harness. - He comes straight from the racetrack. Come on. The hour has begun. There have been problems with my development in the class. Jansen mean, I'm lazy and naughty - - but we're looking just teaching differently. He says there is not much to boast about. It would also sounds stupid if we always sat and cheered. Sir. Jansen often talk about getting another job. Does anyone know where you can buy a hot dog stand? - There is a snack bar for sale. - Thank you, sir. Krumborg. - And your father is a teacher! - He can not afford a hot dog stand. But he speaks often to read on to the sausage man. Yrsa, few shared styles ud. - You are not afraid of you, Krumme. - Who says I have to be? On nær én eneste - - it is the most miserable essays I have ever in my life read. Sir. Krumborg, you will be so kind as to read your loud for us? Well, do not. Then I must. Yes, I can memorize it. "It's dark morning when I wake up. I go for a walk in the cold and sleet, - - and before I know it, it's dark again. "Is that right? Something is missing. "Kind regards Mads Krumborg." How can you allow you to write such a short style? I chose the topic of "A Year". And what has your style with the seasons do, I ask stupidly. - Yes ... - Be careful what you say. But I wrote about the shortest day. Thanks, that's good. There is absolutely nothing to laugh at. Only Hans wrote a good style. Want to read it? And. "Democracy is a democracy - - where decisions are taken by majority to ensure ... " I wonder what Yrsa see in the show-off? "... in recent years, the word democracy often ..." Sir. Krumborg what is modern society's foundation? Uh ... Road bikes. Democracy. And what is that? When some say that others should help to determine. But when they are, they become acidic. - Where are you from? - The school. Teachers say we must help to determine, but always makes a fuss. Democracy is to talk about things - - and I'd better talk to your father at recess. Overkrummen is better to shout and scream. I promised father to behave nicely, and I will try for his sake. It helps if I do not hear it, the other breaks off. So ... I ask for as soon as I can, that I draw it yourself. Then we ... up there ... And there ... Try to see! Crumb has a cheese. How disgusting! Are you aware that I have been head teacher - - for 12 years, 4 months, 3 days and 44 minutes. But I have never met a boy who was so diligent to visit me. - What? - Krumborg, you have become hard of hearing? - What's wrong with your ears? - Nothing. Why do so with cotton wool in your ears? - It's sort of trouble filter. - Again? A ballad filter? There are things I do not want to hear because they make me mad. Vat helps. Do not you know it? Yes, by God, I do. For staff meetings, you ... Spiller you Billard? Well, lad os see. In fact it is about mathematics and precision. Can you see the line here between the two balls? It forms the angle of the edge here. It is called the angle of incidence. When you come to the ball, hit the gang - - and comes out in what is called the angle. Do you understand? Now you get a little math teaching. - Hey, Krumme. - Was he angry? We played billiards and discussing mathematics. Approaches and outcomes angles. There are well over a billiard table. But do you know nothing about. Billiards is mostly for boys. We must write an assignment about when we were little. It's hard to remember anything about. I could see Yrsa thought I was pretty smart. It's weird with girls. They say you are naughty, - - but they still like that one has little check on it. What are you doing here? Helps police to find people who have illegal weapons. - Do you live here? - No not really. But I have a secret cave. Would you like to see it? I do not really know. Do you need to run around and shoot with that? We live in a dangerous world. There are thieves everywhere. What about you? You have a cave in a strange garden. Stop! One more step and you're dead. Can you see the board in front of you? And web? You step on it, you will be caught. Smoking a few meters into the air. - What's your name? - Mads, but call me Krumme. Okay. I'm Tom. A trap and a secret hollow. Just what I always dreamed of. Tom was certainly no ordinary boy. I collect them. This I got from my father in Africa. - It is a abekranie. - Where you saw the other from? Some I found the skulls. The rest I have cooked. - Cooked? - Yes. - What is it? - It's the dead bricklayer. - What? - Came. A dead bricklayer and cooked skulls. Ham Tom I liked. The man who built the house, was swindler. He did not pay the bricklayer, so bricklayer went bust. He came to shoot the homeowner, but he was chained down here. The man cut him to pieces and burned him fired. See, his cap hangs there yet. He wants out. I do not believe that. It is true. That's why the house is empty. It is a worse haunted. Came. Where are you going? - We sell the bottles and buy sweets. - We must not. Original and romantic. Elegant villa. - It must be an austere mistress. - There is a veranda and a refrigerator. - And a magnificent stucco ... the ceiling. - Is there much noise and fuss? Sound and fury! Only when trees and shrubs slider. What are you doing here? Will you then come here! I shall teach you to steal bottles! It is shown is not exactly what we intended. Came. Herskabsvilla! Then comes so some bottled speculators and idiots ... I draw you to the police, so I get 14 years in prison for children! Vandals! It is nok, Ivan. We must frame them. - How, Boris? You do not ... - That's exactly what I want. Boris, I do not like it. Do we need all the fuss and all the money? Are we doing it? What is it now? All the talk about money makes me nervous, Boris. - Can you not tolerate money? - Yes, just not too many. Quiet, Ivan. We do not share just above, if it is better for you. - Stop it! - It was not me. - Der s a, where constant sneezing. - Yes, Boris. - And it's not me, is it? - No, Boris. So it must be you, right? So here we are, Ivan. - We'll get at them. - How? - I'll explain to you. - How? Yes, it might be difficult. - I'm sorry to say it ... - Say what? - It's brilliant! - Yes, it's smart. What is it? It's a giraffe. - On wheels? - There is a crane. Bravo, Ivan. You may well, when you want. Listen, now we two go to the bank. You take time how long it takes to walk across the street. Into the no. 75 and up to the third floor. Meanwhile I look me around a little in the bank. - Is it now, you will get at them? - Ivan, we are planning. - As in Varde Savings Bank? - Shut up! Then across the street, into the no. 75, up the elevator. Off you go. One, to, three, fire, five, seks, seven ... Hello, Krumme. Are you out of your billiard friends? No ... It's two bank robbers. First pictures you me that you play billiards with the inspector - - and now you're on the trail of a band of robbers. Are not you a bit childish? Yrsa was enormously sweet. Think that the same girl can be so different. I would be cool, but my stomach rumbled. What should I say? Grunk! Minced well-being and småbørnsgrunk to meatballs. - What? - I'm picking up my little brother. Grunkin ... Grunkin. Grunkin ... Grunkin. Grunkin ... Grunkin. I'm good at drawing cats. - Crumb, covers you board? - Yes, father. Hello. Add where here sucks. Following the instructions with? Sometime you will say: "Meatballs, as father made them." - Eat them I survive I do not. - Should you not have food? - You see well enough ... interesting. - It's Dad's meatballs. Oh yes. - What rhymes with growing pains? - Do you write poetry? No, I have to write about when I was little. How was I? - Hugely small. You cried at night. - What do you know about it? - You slept the. Safe and good. - Sov I? You snored so loud that you woke Krumme. It's Svendsen. She plays loud. He just need a beer. Come in and have a beer, Svendsen. Now, many roofs. - Dav, Per. - Good day. - Is Stine home? - Just follow the sound. Come honey. Yes, come here. - Cross, where are you stupid! - Do you think so? Are you washing today? So I do the rest of the week. - Please, sweet crumb. - So you also need to remember it. Yes, yes, Mrs. Olsen. We must all be here. It's probably also what Mrs Olsen believes. - You are a treasure, Krumme. - I have gymnastics in the morning. Well, you said it. I almost forgot your pants. - Can you say goodnight to Crumb? - Good night. Charlie, alfa, foxtrot. Do you read me? Do you speak English? Charlie alfa foxtrot. Can you hear me? Do you speak French? - Do you cry more? - It is a Chinese. I'm too good to me. Because Stine has girlfriend visits - - I stand and wash up. I should get me a boyfriend to get rid of the dishes. But I do not know how they are lovers. I go into the closet and see what Stine and Per doing. Charlie, alfa, foxtrot, do you read me in English or French? France, yes. Come on, Per. Come now. Come now. Per, now let be. You can. You are so nice. You can easily, Per. Come on. Let be, it tickles. - Meditate I do now? - Stand so still. - How long to stand like this? - Several hours. - Have you duck? - No. Krumborg. I have a very nice family. Close looked up, you little brat! Where are you tacky! So I am not really duck. It just so in my spare time. Close looked up! Do not dampen you? I think I have a Chinaman. - I'm here! - Just wait till I get hold of you. Why do you play and in my closet, your worm? I am both a worm and a duck? - Could not you help me a little? - Quiet now. The brat ruining my life. I'm moving out. Come, we are progressing. We are renting the room out to a disc jockey! Thanks for tonight. Get so the dish over. I give up studying for the exam. Just because you got married young and had three children. I skip the exam. Drags life as a humble instrument for my family. I did not get that. Does this mean I do not have to wash the dishes? This means you should wash up with no more fuss. - It's Mrs. Olsen, sir. Caretaker. - Wrong number. - I have had quiet tenants upstairs. - Hello, Mrs. Olsen. And then comes Krumborg. The sewing machine. The banks in the floor ... - That is clear. - I have holes in the ceiling. I find myself not in! Here you can listen to this! No, Mrs. Olsen. I've called for the janitor! - There is no home. - Nonsense! Have you now together. And. - Well DAV, Svendsen. - The gal you again, Krum Borg. There are complaints. It can not keep going on this way. - Come in and get the beer. - Yes. Have Krumborg even made it to electric? Yes, he's very proud of it. Larmer it too much, Svendsen? - Yes. - I am done now. Here. Now you see. I think I got hold of a Chinaman. - Here's your pants. - Thanks. - Stine wash up the rest of the week. - So we hope it. - There he is. - It is Wong down from the takeaway. Do not order two spring rolls for me? Yes, do you read me? Do you read me? Hear Wong. Can not come up with two spring rolls for Krumborg? - It's good enough. - I do not understand. It stands on Shanghai. - Shit. - What are you doing? I can not open. It is locked. Nonsense, it binds only. Just beware. - So, so. Tear now not the whole house down. - The binder course. - Do not. It is noisy. - It will be OK. - It was locked. - It kunne you have said. - That's what I tried. - Come to bed. Was it possible to be quiet so Grunk can fall asleep? - I could be quiet. - If you start now? No, I just think ... - If Mrs. Olsen ... - It was not on purpose. ... springrolls ... It had been a long day, and it was hard to fall asleep. I would have told the father and mother of the robbers and Tom and cave - - but they would not like to hear it. Just mother soon had finished the exam. Overkrummen is a shit! Why is he a teacher at my school? He is often angry at the big boys and yell and scold. Yrsa and Hans think it's fun. I put never foot in that class. I hate them. Tom? Tom? I was alone in the world. Father and mother were too stupid and Stine hate me. Maybe they should disappear. Go to Australia and open a kiosk. Or to Greenland as sælfanger. Revenge of the dead bricklayer! Hello. Does anyone in your home? - No, I think not. Why? - We need to cook a cat. Cooking a cat! It did not sound nice. And certainly not at home with us. Is not it beautiful? Add the missing! It should have little soy. It takes the smell. - Boy, it stinks. - It's not perfume, we do. Nothing comes out. - Do you know who lives there? - Nah ... Mrs. Olsen. Take the fun. Tom er her. - Do you have a snot? - A snot? You hoist me down, so I wash the glass. - It ends up wrong, Tom. - This is your life, Krumme. Revenge of the dead bricklayer. Good morning, Mrs. Olsen. Lovely weather. What are you doing there? Are you crazy? I polish the windows. Is on sale this week. All windows for 50 kr. I take the mirrors for a tenner extra. Similar to cheek! Come out! Okay, so I fly. Call if they repent. Tom's Window Cleaning. So it's up! The kids ... - Did you get the soybeans of? - Not quite. - Was it she who screamed? - Yes, it sounded not funny? The cat! Of course it ended wrong. Skruphamrende wrong. It smelled of boiled cat in the whole area. There were at least two million liters of soy to take the smell. Well, that's enough father who has made food. Then it out! They cooked a cat! Home with you! Move! Krumme, you raving lunatic? - We want to know ... - Yes! So it's good! I am a patient man. I mind my own business and my family. My son has cooked a cat. So what? Boil many strange things here. Occasionally, someone who burns Hungarian goulash, right? Or you look "Then there are cartoons" and afterwards "Wheel of Fortune", - - while boiling rice pudding. But what is the crime, I ask? We live in a poor construction, not maintained. My floor is the ceiling of a lady who has the best hearing. You know how much respect I take to you? I Pills come out of the cheese not to crunch. The other day I lost a little come on the carpet. A dog with normal hearing had not heard it. But they, Mrs. Olsen, The Hörte it. Yes, you can go! - So ... - Be quiet! Get in! But do not go on the floor. Crooked, you make many stupid things at the moment. Møgunger. I'll have to take you along. Mrs. Olsen was on the phone 20 times last week. And then I get up and complain, right? And my stamps is one tangle. And I must also sweep the yard. It's nothing personal, right? You know what I mean about the lady. It is not easy to be the caretaker. It would nodig go to the 1962nd - There we had a family ... - We do! We do! Come on, everybody. We're going to run. - I have no time for this nonsense. - When I say come, I mean it. - Come on. - Come on. Came. There are new times coming. We looked at many houses that day, but they were all too expensive. Eventually found the father finally one. Haunted House. "Elegant villa with old, well-kept garden. 850,000." It is an offer for a DIY man. The need is a screwdriver. "Beautiful nature a stone's throw from here." Who will throw the stone? It looks terrible. But see the prices. - Do you have the cat with? - Are you crazy? My parents are here. - My father will buy the house. - Should you then stay here? Never in my life. My mother will not suffer. - Determines your mother everything? - Yes. Father discovers it just does not. But maybe there are new times coming. Stine, listen now. There is no Mrs. Olsen and there is plenty of space. We can stay here for months without bothering each other. My children must be confirmed before you finish. So we keep the party here. It becomes or Mrs Olsen for life. Maybe we can print money. 850000 ... It is a lot of money, Mr. Krumborg. Bank miss a great business. That sounds fine. But we now need a mansion? They should not be moved. Oh no. But I must of course consider whether they can afford it. - Do you not live by lending money? - Jo. But we must have some of them back. - Hello? - It is Ivan here. - It's nothing fancy clothes. - Do you, Boris? Do you have a siren, you can put on your head when you go into the bank? - I might try ... - Look, so to get going. So we'll see. I have been a customer for 20 years. Should I move my debt to another bank? No, such was the ikke segments. - I have some minuses here. - Yes, there are a few. So should perhaps have made those ... Let's look at it, Krumborg. One can postpone the cash requirements. And then there is a significant tax advantage. We can make a mortgage secured by the house. With a change of priorities and a debtor clause. Come now. - On! - Yes. - I get dizzy, Boris. - Enjoy the view of wealth and happiness. There must be cleared up. Away with all blob debt. Everything is gathered here. And so nothing to buy on account. I will not in all, just because I purely temporary lack of money. Interest temporarily? At 16 years, Mr. Krumborg, - This is a bank robbery. - Sir. Krumborg though! - It was not me. That's it there. - A robbery. This is me talking. Currently we aim Those who sit and talk with tyksakken. Tyksak ... Must I be free? So we tuck our feet in the air ... Idiot! Conditions you quietly. I have a bomb, I can trigger, if not all do what I say. Close all inside the toilet. And keep hands off the alarm. It was good to say, Boris. - They can not lock us inside. - Jo. We can not be here all along. We empty the drawers of cash. Let it go a little strong. Moment, sir. Backpack ... Look, it's 50-krone and 100-krone notes. And here we have 500 kroner and 1,000 kroner. It was that. Look at the top. Well, there are several? I apologize. I'll be there. And so go the the street, into the no. 75 and elevator up to the third floor. Here he comes. Run us up, Ivan. Stop. - Good day. - Good day. - Here you go. - Down in the bag with them, Ivan. And you relate them quiet until we are gone. That is clear. Complete. It is not closed. Goodbye. Down into the bag. Then we go down, Ivan. - Yes Yes. - Come on. Stop! - Damn. - What now, Boris? Swing over to the track. Hold on, Ivan. - I do not have my voucher with. - Shut up, Ivan! - Who beckons you to, Boris? - I said shut up! Boris, should not we rather take a taxi when we've got all the money? - Can you continue? - Yes, if you think that Boris. Boris, there is a lot of money. More than I can tolerate. I can not stand you. - And if someone comes? - It will be worse for them. - You do not ... - Ivan, the house is for sale. - And if someone wants to look at it? - Who the hell would buy such a house? - If it was a blob of paint ... - Shut up, Ivan. - What now, Boris? - I go up there. - Surely you do not ... - Yes, if necessary. Hello, we are the family Krumborg. We had an appointment at. 13th Had we not been out here the other day, we were too late. But now we are all here. We look forward to seeing the house. - If you have time to show us that. - Of course. Come on in. - Dad ... - Come on. We must get in and see. In short, it is a møghus. Here is the bathroom. There are so cold that they have put a stove in there. Were I you, I looked around for a stupid bungalow in Vanløse. Mom, it's one of the bank robbers. I've even seen them. Fired. A converted boiler from a ferry. May explode anytime. Excuse the delay. Police have blocked the area. - Up with paws! - The bank robbers. - Bank robber? - You're not going down there. It is dangerous. - Ivan, we are recognized. - Me too? Godfather preserved! Come on. Let's go. Out! - Come on, Ivan. - Yes Yes. - What are you messing us into? - I do not know. - I'd better call the police. - Loans my phone Krumborg. - Thank you, Boris. - What the hell are you doing, Ivan? - I smoke in a trap. - I can almost figure out. - You asked himself. - Gu did not! Come now. Gyvelvænget second Signalement? Moment. Krumme, tell the police how they look. One is long and thin and sneezes all the time. The other has gold in the ear. Hello Darling. I am at home in three weeks. - Goodbye, Chitika. Take care of mom. - Goodbye, Dad. They do not come back. It is a case that they have been hiding here. - They went out through the cellar. - Now I owe you a tour. - No, it's certainly not just anything. - Nonsense. - Now we drive, Boris. - You do not say, Ivan. - Do you think we are far away? - We get off when the car is. 850,000 minus 75,000.

It stands in the upper house with the uhyggelige lighthouse, Boris. - Is there anyone who is sick? - We are in Turkey, Ivan. - Should not we be here? - No, Ivan. We have to go home. I thought mother would be separated and Stine move if we bought the house. But you can not always rely on women. Now we live in ghost house with hollow, Tom and the dead bricklayer. Maybe it's fine with ghosts when I release of Mrs Olsen. But the idea of ​​Svendsen no more should have klageøl - - it was so weird. Life can be strange. - Hey, Krumme. Move In Now? - No, we count our furniture. And then there's a stair. Good morning. - We would help you out quickly. - So in a pleasant way. Yrsa's mother and Mrs Olsen has been sweet since they heard we moved. - Hey, Svendsen. - Hello. - Just go up. We are done. - You would not like to be bothered. - Hey, Stine. - Hey, Yrsa.

Come on, dad. - They forget wicker suitcase. - No, it's not ours. It has sold to new tenants. It is sad to say goodbye to good neighbors for so many years. - It's life time, Mrs Jensen. - Do you know who's moving in? - Are there children? - Shown only three at home. The fourth sitting inside ... For violence against older women. Good morning. (An alarm clock ringing) Here it is. Grunkin, Grunkin. Grunk? Well, Grunk. Should I report them to child protection? - And. - And. - No! - Can we get a home out of this? A blob of paint and a screwdriver, the job's done. The blob of paint is shown in 500 liters. Before we bought the house, spoke father to sit in the garden and read a newspaper. The newspaper was spared away, and he took extra lessons - - to afford the rent. Mother had also busy.

It is not good to wash up in. Why are we the only passengers who should wash up? Just do your job, so the captain is not sour. I do not like to sail. It goes so much up and down. It's like life, Ivan. - What rhymes with heart? - Distributor ... "My heart is like a distributor." It does not rhyme. - What? - It is the red wire. It is not the yellow.

There were some thieves who would sell our house. But they ran. I am afraid that they will come again. One was about to shoot my father. They are dangerous. - I was out driving in their car. - It sounds exciting. So it is true. - What's your name? - Crumb. - Who is Karlo Albertsen? - A dog. It has been for dinner.
