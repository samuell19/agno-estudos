Cai-ning! Surprise! I just don't understand. Why are you upset? ACQUAINTANCES, DAY 1 I told you. I went out with a male colleague yesterday, so I adjusted the passenger seat. And you're upset because of that? So this is his? Do I look like an idiot? Listen to me, Cai-ning! Cai-ning! Cai-ning... Song Cai-ning! Don't be upset. We've been together, and we've been happy, right? But you're cheating on me. Don't be ridiculous. We're not married yet. Right? Look at other girls. They don't mind when something like this happens. Come on. Get in the car. No! I'm breaking up with you! What's your problem? Watch out! What are you doing? None of your business! Shut up! Song Cai-ning! You'll regret what you're doing. I don't think you can live without me. One more second. - What the hell! - What are you doing? What's the matter? But I am outside. I'm sorry. Thanks. ACQUAINTANCES, DAY 2 I think you went too far. A girl doesn't kiss any boy in the street. I smell gossip. It's not what you're thinking. Where are you going? - Lunch. - Come on. Lunch break. - Okay. - Let's go. Lunchtime. Yeah. Come on, Cai-ning! Okay. We're almost there. - Up ahead. - Come on, Cai-ning! Are we there yet? - Be quick. - What? Here we are. Song Cai-ning! Wait! It's your staff badge. I'm Luke. Don't thank me this time. Run! Who's that? You don't know him? He's good-looking. - Don't be silly! - And he's tall. Easy. That one is okay. - Is that okay? - Sip slowly. ACQUAINTANCES, DAY 14 Let's watch a movie later. - Okay. It's been a long time. - Yeah. How is your ski trainer job going? Yeah, it's fine. Lots of kids lately. So noisy. How could you do this to me? It's not the baby's fault. I'll kill you for that. Then we're even. Hello. Nice to meet you. I'm his mom. What's going on between the two of you? Mom! I'll take the responsibility. One, two, three. Again. One, two, three. ACQUAINTANCES, DAY 90 Excuse me. Hello? Yeah. I'll be right there. Okay. Bye. Cai-ning? Something's wrong with my boat. They need me. But we just got here. They don't know how to deal with it. I'll be right back. - Go. - I'm sorry. - Be careful. - Yeah. WHAT TIME WILL YOU BE BACK? HAVE YOU FINISHED YET? THIS IS TAKING FOREVER. YOU'RE NOT HAPPY, RIGHT? YES. IF THE ANSWER IS YES, LOOK TO YOUR LEFT. To my left? GOOD THINGS ARE COMING FOR YOU Yeah, right. IF THE ANSWER IS YES, LOOK TO YOUR RIGHT. MIRACLE COMING IN 30 SECONDS. Where exactly are you? I'M RIGHT WHERE YOU EXPECT ME TO BE. I want you to be with me. I'm right here with... Hey. You don't need to use these tricks. Just tell me sincerely. Then I'll tell you sincerely... that I love you. What about you? ACQUAINTANCES, DAY 2,224 Oh no! Oh no! - What's wrong? - It's hard being your best friend. I make the preparations. I'm the photographer. On your wedding day, I'll be the usher, right? Yeah. But what will you do? I'll be the groom, idiot! I quit. I mean, I'm a professional Youtuber. The things you ask me to do are a waste of my talent. You've only got 30,000 followers. You're not that professional. I'll have a million followers soon. How long have you been a Youtuber? Three years. See? Not professional. Why do you want to get married? Cai-ning is a nice girl. She's gentle and sweet. We have a lot we can talk about. I'll be the happiest husband. And? And... my mom will be happy to have a daughter. It's you who wants her, not your mom. I'm trying to win here. Give it back! I don't think Cai-ning will say yes. We'll see tomorrow. Yeah. Okay. Let's wait and see. LOOP HAIR SALOON What? Where are you? On my way. On your way where? To hell or a hotel? What are you talking about? I'm on my way. Do you think I'm a fool? Come on. We're all waiting for you. All right.

Have you ever felt like you're repeating a day you've already had? What are you talking about? Yeah, I know this. It's called “déjà vu." It's French. Do you mean the film starring Denzel Washington? No. The same things are happening again, like it's the same day. Final Destination? Lots of people died in that film. Yeah. Be serious, will you? You're the one who needs to be serious. What are you talking about? - Do you want to marry Cai-ning? - Yeah. - Do you? - Yes! That's it! Pull yourself together. Don't lose your mind. Go on. Our target is here, approaching the café from the gate. She's here early. Buy me some time. How much more time do we need? How much more time? Half an hour. Half an hour, more or less.

Forget that. Meet me at the breakfast joint. Bye. - Good morning. - Morning. What the hell are you doing? They're really mad at you, you know? And you're eating here. Listen to me. I... I think... I'm repeating this day. I'm repeating this day. Do you think that if you bullshit hard enough, it'll sound logical? But I'm serious. What if it were you? If it were me, I'd buy some lottery tickets and make a fortune. You idiot! - Can you be serious? - It's bullshit. - Nothing to be serious about. - Why don't you believe me? Because I'm not an idiot. If you don't want to propose, just tell me. I won't mind. I want to propose, but it's destined to fail. You haven't done it yet. How do you know it'll fail? I have done it! Twice! And it was exactly the same! When? Don't you understand what I'm saying? No. Fine. I'll rephrase it. Cai-ning said no to my proposal. What should I do? But you haven't proposed yet. How do you know that she'll say no? I mean if... if she refuses to marry me, what should I do? Be quiet. People are eating here. I'm sorry. What should I do? You should... ask her directly. Yeah. Let's go. Come on. I'll pay the bill tomorrow, ma'am. But you haven't paid for months. It's Saturday. What are you doing at her work? She's working overtime. Nobody works on Saturdays. - Is she cheating on you? - Stop the nonsense. Oh no! What should we do? They're leaving. What should we do? Stop filming! It's broken, Luke! Hey, Luke! Wait for me! I'm not in the car! Come on. Thank you. Thank you. HANPIN HOTEL I like it this way. No, that way. No. I want it like this. But if you do it like this, what if it gets messy? Just take it easy. Fine. Let's get messy. Yeah. See you tomorrow afternoon. Bye. Why are you doing this to me? - Song Cai-ning! - Surprise! Lu Yi-jin? What are you doing here? Are you... celebrating my birthday? - Hi, boss. - Hello, sir. What are you doing here? Don't you remember what day it is today? What are you talking about? Will you marry me? - What are you doing? - Will you marry me? No! It's so fast this time. Thanks for your crap idea. You almost ruined me. What? What did I do? Cancel the meeting. I'm not proposing today. What? But you... - Mom? - What? Cai-ning doesn't love me anymore. It was just a bad dream. Mom? If you were repeating the same day again and again, what would you do? My life has been like that for over twenty years. Since you were born, my days have been almost the same. I love you. You're being silly. I'm going to pee. Isn't it your proposal day? Why are you still here? I'm wondering why she doesn't want to marry me. You haven't proposed yet. How would you know? I've failed three times. When did you propose to her? Three times? I don't know. If you're afraid that you might fail, why don't you ask her best friend? No. I don't get on with her. I don't understand your mom. She knows that you hate coriander. Why does she have to add it? Because I know that you like it. So you asked her to prepare it for me, baby. Wait... It's all in your head. It's definitely the reason. It's impossible. Why are you so sure? Look, if she loves Cai-ning, she would've told her. But they're just friends. You don't get it. It is a man's hunch. What have I done to you to give you that inferiority complex? What inferiority complex? Fine. I'll confront her. Hey. That table. Thanks. What do you want? Have a seat. Ma'am? Give her your best combo. - My treat. - Okay. Would you do me a favor? Why should I help you? Don't you want Cai-ning to be happy? And you can make her happy? Why can't I? Fine. Tell me. What has been troubling her lately? I forgot her birthday? I forgot to pick her up after work? I bought a boat with our savings? Bullshit! You're fooling me. You men always think that what's troubling a girl has something to do with you. Fine. I promise you that I'll spend the rest of my life making her happy. Hey, Miss. Don't worry. He's faithful. He has been eating here for years. The same food every time. - Our best combo. - Thank you. Fine. Tell me. What do you need me to do? Why doesn't Cai-ning want to marry me? What do you think she could know that would make her hesitant to marry you? Think hard. Why did your ex-girlfriend tag you on her dog's birthday? It's nothing. It's just because we took care of the dog together. - I'll take care of it now. - What? Lu Yi-jin! Lu Yi-jin! Hey! Here's the bill. - Didn't he pay you? - No. He hasn't paid us for three months. Three months? Damn! Lu Yi-jin! - Hey! - Lu Yi-jin! Hey! My bag! - I'm sorry. Pay me first. - Give me a break. - Pay me first. - I don't have money on me. - I'll pay tomorrow. - Pay me first. You really don't want her anymore? Of course, I want her. But I'm getting married. So she's yours now. We broke up long ago. Does your girlfriend mind? Fine. Let's take one last photo. Here. Look at the camera. One, two, three. Lu Yi-jin? - What are you doing? - Who's that? Nobody. - Just a friend. - Jean. What are you doing here? Your boyfriend is cheating on you. Cai-ning! It's not what it looks like. What is it then? What do you have to say? Jean. Tell me. Who are you? Why are you so mean to him? - Don't you know that he has a girlfriend? - Yeah, I know. And you're trying to steal him from her? - Who do you think you are? - It's none of your business. - None of my business? - Be quiet! Cai-ning... will you marry me? You cheating bastard! - Take a look. - No. Did you see the new episode yesterday? Yeah. I love the leading actor. I love the supporting actor. But I don't like the plots at all. Me neither. It's cancer every time. The leading lady had a car accident and then cancer. Yeah. She got cancer after the accident. Double whammy. The ending of that episode made me sad. I hope that it'll be a happy ending. I don't want my boyfriend to be sad. Here you go again. All of the leading actors are your boyfriends. Excuse me. Can I ask you something? We're not buying anything. I'm not selling anything. - We don't do direct selling. - I don't either. - Ask away then. - Thank you. Can you tell me under what circumstances would you say no to your boyfriend's proposal? Not handsome enough. Then why are you dating him? You're right. Sexually incompatible? No. We're fine in bed. You think everything's fine, but maybe it's not. - You can't satisfy her. - Hey. - Is this conversation legal? - Come on. You don't know what we normally talk about. It's no big deal. All right. What about other than sex? Maybe she's... Sick? That's impossible. That only happens in soap operas. This is not a soap opera. Smells good. What's wrong? Nothing. - Maybe he's cheating on her? - Yeah, I think so. Thank you. JINGMEI HOSPITAL 3 PM TO 4 PM DINNER 6 PM TO 9 PM JINGMEI HOSPITAL Miss Song Cai-ning? Come in. I'm sorry. - Let me help you. - Thank you. Are you alright? Sit down. Let's see. I'm sorry. JINGMEI HOSPITAL PATIENT PROFILE Cancer? Hello? What are you doing? You missed the meeting and all of my calls. Are you going to propose or not? I'm sorry. Go ahead according to the plan. I'll be there on time. Are you crying? No. I'll be there soon. Bye. Are you crying? No. Yeah, right. Our target is here, approaching the café from the gate. Buy me some time. How much... - How much more time do we need? - Half an hour. Half an hour. What should we do? What are you crying for? Don't cry. Save your tears for our celebration. Here. Change your pants. I'll help you. A quick rehearsal. Cai-ning will be here. Enter the leading lady. Five, four, three, two... Don't cry. Tears are like pearls. - Shut up! - What? She's beautiful. Luke? Luke! So... Cai-ning? I've made up my mind. I know we don't have much time left, but I still want to marry you. Let's fight together against the cancer. Lu Yi-jin? That's not my medical record. Besides... Do you think I'd get testicular cancer? Testicular cancer? What? Nothing. Don't make that noise then. Lu Yi-jin! You asked me to prepare for your proposal. And now you're cancelling it. Why? You said you wouldn't mind if I canceled. When did I say that? Last time. When? Tell me. Why don't you tell me? - Tell me! - Stop it! - You think you can beat me? - I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Forget it. You're too stupid to know anything. - You're stupid! - Stop! Come back here! What? I'm running away because I can't beat you. Idiot! What? Yeah. I can run away. I won't fail if I don't do it. We're not doing anything today but playing video games? When is the proposal scheduled? Six o'clock. What is it? It's safe now. I'm playing too. You're in the mood for games? LET'S BREAK UP. LET'S BREAK UP. What? Did you dream about dog shit? No. I stepped on dog shit. Nonsense! Breakfast is on the table. Go eat. LIU I left my phone at home. You can't break up with me. Mr. Lu! Mr. Lu! Registered mail for you, Mr. Lu. Registered mail? Here. Sign here, please. Thank you. Shit! TO LU YI-JIN Shit! Here. - Have a steamed bun. - Thank you. You're welcome. What are you talking about? What? An owl? What are you doing? I knew you wouldn't believe me. You never believe what your best friend says. Go! Find someone and see if they believe you. Fine. Forget it. But do me a favor. I can't take it anymore. Can you give me some useful suggestions? Just a little bit. I'm the one who can't take it anymore. What the hell are you talking about? All right. Let's look at it following the logic of films. Usually, the protagonist's first love wouldn't be the right one. It's supposed to be the one who takes care of him and stays by his side. Is there anyone like that around you? You mean yourself, right? I knew it was me. Why didn't you say so? - You're an idiot! - You're the idiot! Don't you have a better idea? Yeah, I've got it. I'll tell you tomorrow when I have one. I told you, there's no tomorrow for me. That's the idea. Today is more important than tomorrow. Just seize the day. Listen to your mom... Eat your steamed bun. Good morning. How can I help you? Hey, young man! You haven't paid! You've done well today. Those flips of yours looked steadier. Because I've practiced a lot. By the way, you were wanting to buy one more boat. Did you decide? Buy it. Just buy it. Don't you have to discuss it with Cai-ning? No, I don't think so. What exactly are you hiding from me? They have some lovely tents here. And the little lights. I need to talk to Cai-ning. Cai-ning? Why did you say no to me? I said no to you? What do you mean? If I've done something wrong, just tell me. I can make it right. You haven't done anything wrong. Maybe I'm not good enough for you? Lu Yi-jin, what are you talking about? Cai-ning, will you marry me? But I... Thank you. Eat it while it's warm. What do you want? Is Cai-ning... hiding something from me? How did you find out? Never mind that. But I want to know what she's hiding from me. What's the use of telling you? You never normally care about others. Can you please tell me? Please. Please tell me. Let go! Cai-ning is pregnant. Look at that, Miss Song. That's the baby's heart. It looks normal. Everything's fine. You need to be eating a healthy diet now. It's so tiny. See that? The tiny heart is beating. Aren't you wondering why Cai-ning didn't tell you that she's pregnant? Lu Yi-jin? You have a guitar class today, don't you? Stop playing these games. It's almost over. If you were my son, I'd smash your head. You won't have a son. Why not? Because I don't want one. LOOP HAIR SALOON How's that? I like it. Thank you. Have a nice day. Yeah. Hi, there. How did the proposal go? Did Cai-ning say yes? Mom? Why did you... decide to give birth to me? Because I loved kids. I was happy when I got pregnant. So I gave birth to you. I mean... You've been tied down because of me. You can't do whatever you want when you want. And I just went wherever I wanted. I never cared about how you felt. Come here. Sit down. I'm going to wash your hair. Sit down. Last time I washed your hair, you were still a preschooler. Then you entered elementary school. You didn't want me to do it anymore. You wanted to do it by yourself because you were a big boy. Mom? Don't you think that since you had me, you've been tired every day? I'm tired, but I'm happy. - Happy? - Of course. With a son like you, I'm very happy. Although you've been lazy and forgetful, I know that you love me. And you have a kind heart. And you're nice to your friends. I'm about to attend your wedding. You're the greatest achievement of my life. Mom... I'm sorry. I can't get married. Cai-ning is breaking up with me. There must be some misunderstanding. Cai-ning is pregnant. She doesn't think I'm good enough to be her child's dad. How could she say that? But when I heard the news, I was really scared. Because if I have a child, I have to say goodbye to the lifestyle I have now. WILL YOU MARRY ME? Son... You're a grown-up now. You have to take on responsibilities. You can't run away just because you're scared. Liu? Cancel the whole thing. Bye.

Sometimes I upset you without knowing it I'm not at all romantic But with this song I promise I promise To protect you always Come rain or shine I promise To protect our love For the rest of my life Baby, will you marry me? When did you learn to play the guitar? What is this? I sold the boat. Why? I thought it over. Work is one thing, but a dream is another. I'll work hard to be a water ski trainer. But why? Because I want us to make a family. I grew up without a father. My mom had to work hard... to bring me up. I want my kid to have it easier. Now you're pregnant. We're a complete home. How did you know that I'm pregnant? MOM MANUAL Cai-ning... will you marry me? Get back! Inside! You pervert! Listen! I can't take it anymore! - I just can't take it anymore! - I'm sorry. Cai-ning? Why don't we go shopping for a crib tomorrow? Hello? Yeah. I'm going out. Yeah. See you at the hospital. Bye. So... You've decided to let him go? Yeah. WILL YOU MARRY ME? Lu Yi-jin... I... Luke! Watch out! His concussion is so bad... because of how frequently he practices extreme sports. Luke! What's wrong? No! Don't! Luke! What's wrong? Luke! The blood clot in his brain has been removed, but we can't promise that he'll wake up. Hey, Son. You know... I went with Cai-ning to her prenatal checkup... and they told us that it's a girl. Get well soon, okay? You'll buy lots of pretty dresses for your little princess. The doctor said that if it goes on like this, he may develop respiratory failure... and many other complications as well. Don't you regret it? His mom has made a decision. What are you doing here? - Hi. - Aren't you coming in? Son... They said that you've got multiple organ failure. This time... I'll have to let you go. I grew up with him. He's always been full of shit. But he's silent now. I'm not used to it. Don't worry. I'll take care of his mom, and you as well. Go in. Tell him that... if he wants me... to arrange his wedding... I'll always be here. Hi, Auntie. How could you do this to me? You promised to take the responsibility. Mom! I'll take the responsibility. I was afraid that... you wouldn't know what to do... if you knew I was pregnant. You won't have a son. Why not? Because I don't want one. That's why I said no to your proposal. Lu Yi-jin... Thank you for letting me kiss you. Thank you for... holding my hand and keeping your promises. Thank you for the sweet proposal. Thank you for loving me. That kiss... you can pay me back for it in the next life. Lu Yi-jin... Yes, I will. Do you hear me? I will marry you. Translated By: Bill Zhu
