Vertigo for a killer. The boss was right: he finally came out. Drive. He mustn't reach the subway. What's with you? You never missed a 1 franc coin at twenty yards. There are the boss and his brother. He missed. I fail to understand. I took the side lane, driving him almost home. You did it on purpose. He's your mate. My brother just learned the fact. Do it! Stop it! I'll avenge you. I'll avenge you... What you're asking me is a delicate matter. You need a suit but everybody's butt naked here, pal. How bothersome is this whole story! I'm asking it as a favour. Alright. I'll try to arrange it for you. You're lucky that he's the same size as you are. And that nobody came to claim him. Well, your clothes suit him alright, come to think of it. - Thanks. - Good luck. - Are you lost too? - No. Do you know if we're far from Montargis then? No, I don't. Oh? If I'm late, they're going to roast me. Maybe your mate knows? Let's ask him. My mate is not feeling well. - Nothing serious, I hope? - No, it's nothing. Good. Because if he needs a tonic, I've got some in the lorry. The strong kind. It would wake up the dead. Do you want a shot? No, thanks, we just stuffed ourselves. And you let him drive? That is careless. - I'm going to take the wheel. - Oh, good. Have a nice drive. - Mr. Barcus? - Yes. - Is this your car? - Yes, it was stolen. - Did you report it stolen? - No. I was about to. When they're roasted that way, they all look alike. Do you recognize this signet ring? - No. - He wore it on his finger. - Commissioner, please. - Please excuse me. The tow truck is coming. Where should we take the wreck? He didn't get very far. Among all the things they found in the car, did you see a revolver? We'll put the entrance of the fainway just in the middle of the port. Yes, that will please the prefect. - Yes, we leave the old cape untouched. - Obviously. I showed him our plans. - I'm supposed to call him on the phone. - Congratulations. - Ah, Sylvie. Do you like it? - Tell us what you think, darling. Not bad. To our association! To you. To you. - Are you going to Juan's, honey? - Yes. Juan. That's where I'm going too. Pick-up your bag. Yes. Here. Dakar, the 28th. Old sport, I hope you're still in top form and that you didn't hurt my messenger, because he was quite expensive and can be used again. I do not regret my last stay in the USA, which at least had the merit to introduce me to your Texan postman. I guess you're comfy at Juan's. He's an honest bloke who can be relied on. Everything has been readied for you here: the essentials as well as the superfluous which are so necessary. Your friend who does not forget what he owes you and who waits for you. Private property. No bathing. We wish to thank madam again. We'll come back on sunday, as agreed. My best wishes to your cousin. There we are. Five days without servants. Closed Lock it! Curtain! So? Is the business good these days? Nothing's good. Don't you read the papers? Don't you have tenants by the month? Who pay well? You know perfectly well that I only do tricks. But if you hide someone, the price is not the same. Hey, guys! That's enough now. Cut the bullshit. Come on, Francis! Are you finished clowning around? We're going up for a small check? No! No, no, don't show yourself. Leave it to me. I'm used to them. - Juan... - Stay out of it. Here's your small check. I even doubled the price. - Oh, good idea. I'm so thirsty! - He's so thirsty. It's entertaining to see you fight. And you're not pulling your punches. So? You're putting me in a difficult situation. I warned you. Wouldn't you like that? No. That would please you too much. Bravo. - Mr. Renard is asking for you. - Let him come in. - We found his trail, boss. - Oh? He's on the French Riviera. - Thank you. - You're welcome. What's with you? How clumsy can you be? I'd swear he did it on purpose. I can't offer those flowers now. Don't worry. I'm going to replace them with fresh ones and I'll have the gentleman pay for them. That will teach him. Would you still like carnations, madam? Of course, miss. Red ones. Here. With my apologies and my thanks. - Your change. - No, don't bother. Mr. Robiak, Mr Robiak, passenger on the UTA Flight number 1335, must now come to Gate 7 for immediate boarding. - Good morning, Mr. Guissard. - Good morning. - Here: my ticket. - Thank you. With your leave? - Aren't you going, Mrs. Guissard? - No, my husband travels alone. Oh, shall we fly together? Pals? - No. Bordeaux this time. - Oh? Bordeaux. - Another time. - Yes. Well? Here. For the horrible Mrs. Van Welden, with all my love. Thank you very much. What are you doing here? What are you looking for? Was it really he who died in that car? You and you, this way. The others, come with me! Hiding is useless. You saw my husband go, you were waiting for me. Don't act innocent. I understand it all. You're right. It's true. A woman can always tell these things. Thank you, madam. - What's eating you? - Nothing. Some people I didn't want to see. What are you making up now? Admit it: you're in love with me. You've been following me all morning. So it's no use inventing stories. What are you going to do? Kill you! You're mad, Philippe! I think you're very entertaining. I'm going to offer you a drink. I've got a very old whisky that you're sure to like. Oh... Of course, after, you'll have to leave, or it wouldn't be fun anymore. I guess a woman like you always want to change things. Furs, jewelry, cars. You're a fine psychologist. - No, I don't think so. - What's your point? - I'd like to buy it. - What? Your car. All this because I told you I'd send you off after the whisky? So that's what you found in order to stay longer? A commercial transaction. - How much? - Very expensive. I can pay in Swiss francs. Or In dollars. Your price will be mine. How in love with me you must be. I bet you don't even need the car. Oh, this shutter is annoying. What with the wind... Please excuse me. Everything was going fine. I don't get it: you didn't have to call me. I was going to come up and explain it all. He's a hit-man. On the run. What a piece of luck! We couldn't be better off. And all of this thanks to my charm. Now the question is: how do we keep him here? So? What were we saying? Here! I found this on the floor. We were talking about your car. Did you reach a decision? What about discussing it over dinner? Would you take me to Cannes? - No. Not to Cannes. - Oh? To Nice then? Or Monte-Carlo? No. I'd rather not. I understand. You don't want to show yourself. But then it might be true! Somebody's chasing you? I keep telling you so. I'm disappointed. But what on Earth did you do to be tracked this way? - I shot someone. - Why? Because he was about to shoot me. SEW-defiance. A setting of scores... But then... But then you're a... a... I can't find the word. Don't bother: there is no word anymore. So? Will you sell me your car? Now can you understand why I need it? Yes. Very well. But... You'll admit this is quite amazing. I've got a hit-man in my home. He asks if he can buy my car. Oh, I can understand now why you don't want to show yourself. Let's have dinner here then. You'd better wait for nightfall before you hit the road anyway. Well... I'm telling you this but I don't know anything about it. Well... alright. Give me your hand. You can give me your hand since you're not In love with me. As you can see, I've got all that's necessary. I haven't got a maid these days: you'll have to help me. Well? What are you waiting for? Come on, make yourself comfortable. And try to be useful. Oh, I forgot that you were a dangerous man. An armed man. You're not going to dine with this on, are you? As you wish. Alright, I'll help you. May I take this? Oh, wine! What do bad boys like you drink? Whatever you want. Maybe some of them drink Vittel water. I'll fetch you a good bottle all the same. He'll stay. The difficulty is the revolver. Here. Perfect. We can now sit. Thank you. You're going to tell me the story of your life. You'll like it: I'm a very good listener. - Are you waiting for someone? - No, nobody. Don't move. There are three of them. - Good evening, gentlemen. - Good evening, madam. What do you want? We're looking for a dangerous person. - Did you see anybody? - No one. - The man is wanted for murder. - Wanted for murder? Can we check around your house? - In the estate? Out of the question! - On the road? Did you hear? Look, I'm not going to lie to you: I don't like this very much. I can't throw you out just now, but... tomorrow morning... Maybe they saw you climbing in my car. Don't be afraid: nobody will come inside. - Good evening. - Well... good night. He's so focused on his pursuers that he suspects nothing. But we must be very careful: he can get out whenever he wants. And about the revolver: I've got the solution. Don't ever do that! I could have killed you. Didn't you hear the car that stopped for a while? - No. - And then it went away. Excuse me. I'm so excited. - Could I have some coffee? - Yes, of course. Here you are. Is there anybody else in the house? Yes. There are three of us. You, me... and the cat. See? Some more coffee? What are you doing here? I... I heard some noise around the house. I was making sure that all the doors were locked. I must have dreamed it... About earlier... I... Enough... Enough... Enough... - So, Vince? - Let me think. The bloke we're looking for. He's all alone. Not many hiding places around here, are there? Yeah, that's true, yes. But I've got to remember. - First, there is Bergonte's place. - We went there already. No, not this, no! No, wait! - There also number 5, Rue de Manfredi. - Are you kidding me? No, no, stop! I swear on my daughter's head. Oh, your daughter. Yes, I'm glad you mention her. Stay with him. Does she still attend the Sisters of Sainte Marguerite's school? And does she still cross the road at the same spot on her way? Should the wind continue to blow from there... well, we'll have fair weather. And a beautiful sea. Great. - Good morning, Mrs. Guissard. - Good morning. We'll have fair weather today. Yes, that's what Mr. Emile was saying. Should the wind blow from there. When it blows from there, you know, it's not a good sign. The weather could change. They're on the access roads, and there is no other way to leave here. You can't stay any longer. Look, I've got an idea. Come! Shut up! Shhh. Nice doggy, here, nice doggy. Please, untie the moorings! Don't move! Look! He's dead. And you killed him! With your gun! Like this. On your gun, there are only your fingerprints. Don't move! Now here's his gun. He just had the time to kill you before he died. I understand. No, listen, - I did what we planned to do. - Yes. He went overboard. I may have wounded him but I'm not sure. I don't know, no, I don't know. Of course you know. If you'd not failed you wouldn't be in such a state. I shouldn't have left you. But I couldn't show myself. I couldn't take such a risk. Listen: I agreed to it. We'd reached the point where Stéphane had to be killed. He wanted to ruin us and stay the sole owner of the business. It was either he or us. I approved your ideas. Good evening, gentlemen. Madam. We're looking for a dangerous person. I didn't see anybody. He's wanted for murder. Wanted for murder? I'm glad you warned me. The best solution was yours. To make it look like this gangster was the murderer. But should he talk now, we're lost. They'll believe him because Stéphane's death only benefits us. We can't afford to let him live! Here he comes! Get the car ready! Don't move! The keys! The keys, now! Look out! He's behind the car! Yo What's up I'll explain. I need a private hospital. I know just the one: Bel-Air Hospital. Yes... OK... OK, National Road 542. Take the Street of the Four Lanes. I'll try. And rest assured that there will be no question asked. I'm sure of that... yes... - Yes, I'm listening. - I took a wrong turn. It wasn't that difficult! Ask him where he's calling from. Where exactly are you? I'm in... in Grouan, near the lake. Take the first road on your left. Yeah... OK... His car. What make? What kind of car are you driving? A Bentley. Why? Just to know... how long it will take you. Oh, no, no, no reason, no reason, no. Just to know. You're welcome. It's done. It's this way. He can't have more than a five minutes start. Step on it. Turn the car around. There he is! - The police. - They're going to arrest him. We're screwed. Don't commit that kind of of fence again, Or you might get a license suspension, get it? Thank you. Brigadier! Look! Blood. We must find him. It's over. Get in the car, quick!
