At 12 in the afternoon, he walked out on the street... and went to the side of the station. Nobody knew, where he was going. Not even himself. [Kino - A star named the sun] White snow, grey ice on the cracked earth She wears the patched blanket The city inside a circular road And above the city float clouds, blocking the heavenly light. And above the city - golden smoke The city has for 2000 years been living under the light of the star named the sun And two thousand years - war war without special reasons war - business of the young, medication against wrinkles Red-red blood: After an hour - is no more than plain earth, after two - covered in flowers and grass, after three - it came back to life Warmed by the rays of light named the sun And we know, how it always was, what fate is strongest, who lives by other rules, and who dies young He doesn't remember the word "yes" and the word "no", He doesnt remember rank, or name, And can reach to the stars, Don't assume, that it is a dream that fell burning from the star named the sun Hello? Hello? Dina? I cant hear a thing. From Moscow. Yes. Father is in Moscow Let's meet up. Ah. Listen, My money will run out. Hello? Hello? Allright, bye. Bye-bye, kiss. Bye. Bye. And now we will tell you a sad story But don't forget to pay attention while it lasts. Who is it? What do you want? Is Spartak home?

Come on, go, get lost! Go look for him, damn it! Go away, go for a walk, you are stinking up this place! It's time you were introduced to other young people that are very unpleasant As they are always somewhere else Where is Spartak? I don't know. Somewhere wandering around. And who are you? Can I pass him a message? Hey, quickly - go to the elevator! We must check the pressure. Do you hear? Well, what, are you death? - Spartak? - Uh? I've been meaning to tell you for a long time, There is two kinds of people in this world: There's the ones - sitting on pipes, and the others, that need the money. You are sitting on the pipe. Nah. I dont have money. Where did you disappear to? I was looking for you. Everywhere, I looked everywhere and for such a long time. And now i dont have the money.

What other classmates do you have? There is no need for secrecy. Oh well, ok. Just some guy. What are you doing?! Never heat the fireplace! Understood? I don't understand. Does it look like it's about love? And that it is for love that you give away your your happiness Good night. We don't perceive love as a delight But like something much more normal than delight The next morning [in German] On the air with radio Alma-Ata. Morphinehydrochloride. 22-34-00... Hello? Hello.

That is indeed terrible, when someone elses soul enters into your own body. This game, the fight with greedy people. Well, shall we begin? I came from America on a green broom. The broom broke, It stayed on the wagon. Does this mean you see a ball? When you take the ball - To the restaurant you will go. Little Alik, you take - And you will go nowhere. Do you want it, take it, You want it, take it. You want it, take it. Where is the ball? Guess. - Both. - Haha. Guys, come to reason! I am not a waiter. Why? Remember, Archimedes.

[Kino - Bashetunmay] Everyone says, that we are together Everyone says, but not many know, what it means But from our pipes comes a strange smoke Stop: Danger zone - cerebral effort Bashetunmay Bashetunmay... Hey! You don't have cheap smokes? Then I will switch to "Camel"! No! Did you not understand me? Come on, give me! So tell me, without sunglasses it wasn't so hard was it? Stupid girl. Besides that you are stupid - you can not even cook. [Man talks in Uzbekistani] She's sleeping. That same evening Where are the ampoules? Incinerated. Scientists proclaim, that scorpions - are the oldest species on earth. 3 years ago I didn't see them here. Had you seen any, Din? Asshole! Two weeks later What date is it today? Two weeks have passed. So, how are we feeling today? Well, today a little better, a little bit better. - How are you feeling? - I'm warm and stuffy. I'm going to the sea, to swim. And where is the team? Are you sleeping? This evening we will leave from here. I'm going out for a short while. You will be alone, OK? Don't open. Is Dina home? Who? This one. Don't go! He will come back. I'll be back soon. [The poet Edward Hill] What are you standing there, timid? What were you thinking of again? A happy tune jingles - It calls us to dance Hurry up, this song brands, She burned everything around us And, if the heart is singing, We don't need words there I call you, you listen to your song So smile, a little easier! Why dream about the spring? Why wish upon, that she may sleep? It changes completely Your lonesome smile Hurry up, this song brands She burned everything around When the heart sings, Nobody needs words here I call you, listen to your song So smile, a little easier! Archimed, pass me the yoghurt. Wait here. Hey. Come here. Come. Come. Come, come, come. Hi. Hold this. ? -? -?!? - ? -?! ... Spartak. I've come. Do you know... These two, there, in the bar - Epstein and that one, who disturbed me... They used to be my men. Do you understand? I only wanted to play you. Just. So I was nuts, or what? Hah! For me! Forward! Now I will carry out the order here! Come see me here! Whenever you want to hang out! We're all here for you now, Fuck, we'll build! We'll enforce! We'll make it happen! People! Forward, and forwards only! And then - up, and then - back down! From here we will command! Every man here - is "a loner", But all men together - makes "us"! We can trust each other here! Everyone - is selfmade: Freedom! Independance - It's my prerogative! I - the community, that is free... To make it possible to exist! There will be no leader! There will be only one thought. In all of our body! The idea of existence... of the real! Of the self! Life is not about the conscious, life is in the subconscious! We shall free ourselves! Forwards! And after - back! "The conservation of time" - That is our motto! But we closed it! Because... You have not been worthy of my good faith. And you, neither have you! I no longer trust you! I don't trust myself. To fall and to rise? No! To lay down, once fallen! Dear friend! Farewell! I was on your side! Now our companionship will end! Brothers! Thats the way it goes. This is not the purpose of life The purpose is that brain hurts, I don't know what else, I'm tired [Fragment from a cartoon] Look at him. Hey, brother! Slow down. - We need to talk. - Lets go to the side. Let's go. Apart from that my ship has not returned but that our buisiness is great! The animals will perish! Nobody will be rescued! And, so where is the glass? Which glass? Why are you acting the fool? People are waiting. Children, I don't know you. What is it you need? We need the glass. - For the windows? - Don't joke with us! In ten minutes the glass will be here. And if not, then we will continue our conversation differently. And what means "different"? Allright! Good is he who chases the empty truck. Uh-huh. Hey, hey! Both! Thirteen damnations! Doctor... Oh, doctor Ajbolit... Thank you, my friends! You saved me from the nasty bandit... He wanted to throw me into the abyss... The horrid abyss. Doktor Ajbolit! Doktor Ajbolit, I wasnt late! [Fragment from Italian fairy tale] Bravo, Pantalone! Bravissimo! Bravo! [Tune playing] Bravo! Bravissimo, Pantalone! Viva los portes! Pantalone! Bravo, bravo. Indoture! Indoture. Bon diorno, senor Pantalone. Bon diorno, senor Pantalone. Papa? Bon diorno, senori. Como esta, senor Pantalone? Como esta-a, senor Pantalone? Stomali! Stomalissimo! O maldi testa... [Tune playing] I even dont know how to talk with you. As you think, that I started all of this. Nothing depends on me. They demand it every day. Every day! It's necessary to struggle. We are two now - It will be easier for us. You are a good man. Honest. Of that I am certain. Think about it, and Dina we made it out, just you and me. You have to understand these things. Arivederci! El arriva los portes! You are going? This time for long... I will inform with the elders. Uh-huh. Hello? Hellooo? Dina? I will come now. Hello? Do you mind me smoking? [Kino - Bloodtype] Warm place, the street is waiting for our footprints Stardust On the boots A soft arm chair, checkered plaid, Not pressed in a hurry. Sunny day In dazzling dreams Blood group on my sleeve My serial number on my sleeve Wish me luck in the battle Wish me... Not to stay in this place Not to stay in this place Wish me luck Wish me... Luck So what more can you want children? Yeahhh! So OK! There is a way to pay, But I don't want Victory at all cost I don't want to step with my foot on anyones chest I would like to stay with you Just to stay with you But the star high in the sky calls me to the road Blood type on my sleeve My serial number on my sleeve Wish me luck in the battle Wish me... Not to stay in this place Not to stay in this place Wish me luck Wish me... Luck Take account of this sportive optimistic notification. We ended the movie.
