You ready? Oh Barb, give it a fucking rest, please. I swear to God if I didn't have these kids, I would jump out of this car right now. Go ahead, don't let me stop you, woman. Stop the fucking car. Just once, just once. How does it do it, Nathan? What do you mean? How does the moon stay in the same place while we're moving? It's so big, sis. It's just that big. Oh, there it was. - I'm in, I lost. - He's doing it again. God, you're such a selfish you know what. Starts with a C. You guys, that's not where that goes. And up and over and side to side. Can I get some more helping hands, please? Abby, this is a very important achievement. - Of course. - What are we gonna do? You know what else is doable? We're gonna feed the chicken. - Feed the chicken. - Okay, final hugs for dad. Hugs, hugs. Great. All right, outside to play. I don't want to. Excuse me? There's nothing to do. Are you kidding me? When I was your age, I didn't have any of those jungle gym, fancy things. I mean- - You want us to have the same crappy childhood you had? Really?. - Don't encourage it. - Abigail, it's fine. Relax. "Abigail, it's fine, relax." All right guys outside, I will call you later. You know, can you grab that bookcase at the top of the stairs that you've been meaning to grab? Because Davis really wants it at your house and it's heavy and taking up space, and also uniforms, softball uniforms. If you got a pair, then I wouldn't have to be washing them all the time. I will do the bookcase next time. Oh, can't talk to Mom. Ab, I will do the bookcase next time. I'm kind of in a rush. You just did 25 minutes of handshakes with the boys, you can't take, Abigail. Okay, fine. Oh, look at that, it's your mom. Nope. I take it you still haven't spoken to her about not calling me as if we aren't divorced. I forgot. I'll get to it. - Please do. - Mm hm. God, relentless. Hey, bye, good luck with that. Mom. I have to tell you about the pillow. No, no, Ma. I can't talk about pillows right now. I just got the boys back and we're getting settled in. Okay, okay, okay. But we should talk because, interesting, Dad fell again. Again? Is he okay? Yes, he's okay. Why do you sound so annoyed, Abigail? Oh, also interesting, he almost drowned during his pool therapy session, so that might've made him out of sorts. Mom, what do you mean almost drowned? Yeah. - Yeah? - What? I said almost. He's on the floor and can't get up. Interesting. - What? - Well, he's comfortable. Do you think I would leave him there if he wasn't? Ma, how long has he been on the floor for? A few hours, maybe more. What do you think, I'm a monster? Ma. Boys, get inside the house. - Hi, JD. - Hi, JD. Hey, boys, I've got ice cream. Mom, they don't need ice cream. Abigail, I raised two children. Do you think I don't know how to feed children? It'd just be nice if you asked me before you pumped my kids with sugar. - Hi, Dad. - Hi. What's going on here? Well, I was trying to sit down and I missed it. I see that. Let me help you. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Careful, Abigail, you'll get another hernia. I'm fine, Mom. I'm okay. Here, you could- - Okay. - Okay, okay. Okay. - Yup. - Yeah. How's that? Feel balanced? Will you sit on the couch with me? - Of course. - Thanks. Sometimes I, I can't, I can't get my balance. I don't know what's going on. That's what we're trying to figure out with the doctors, okay? Get everything moving the way you want it to. Okay. How was pool therapy? Oh, well I... Abby, I couldn't feel my feet. Never happened to me before. I felt like I was falling backwards and then I tried to right myself and I just kind of tumbled in the pool. Okay. Ma really shouldn't be leaving you. Oh no, no, no. Don't, don't, don't be hard on her. She's doing a terrific job, Abby. Abby, she is the best wife anyone could have. Okay. Have you told your brother about me? Euge, he doesn't give a shit. Ma. - You can tell me. - I know. I just, I haven't really said much to him in the last couple of years. He's a son of a bitch. Ma. I'll be right back, hold on. You are not helping. Well, when you've had your son cut you out of their life for 20 years, then you can tell me how to do this. - Hey, Hey. - Yeah, - what, honey? - No, no, I want Abby. Ah. Okay then. Knock yourself out. - This isn't me. - I know. I love you. Thank you. - Ow. - I'm sorry. Eugene, I'm home. Yoohoo, where are you? Be right there, Barb. - Who do I love? - Us. Who tastes like sugar? We are. All right. Perfect. Good night. I love you. - Love you. - Good night. Good night, Mama. Good night, Grape. Say good night to Matthew. Good night Matthew. All right. - Night. - Night, mama. See you in the morning. Sweet dreams. Boys, breakfast. - Ew. - Here you go. What's that smell? Is something burning, Mom? Oh, shit. It's the sausage. Fuck, fuck, fuck. God dammit. Language, Mama. I mean, you don't need that. You don't need that. You have beautiful pancakes and strawberries with lots of anti-oxidants, great for you. - Eat. - Mama, what's that beep, beep, beeping? Shit, shit, shit, shit. Banana bread. - Banana bread. - Remember last week when you burnt it? Burned it, not burnt it. Daddy never burns breakfast. Well, can Dada make banana bread that's beautiful like this? Yes. - Hi. - Morning. Come on in. Banana bread? Fresh out of the oven. - Oh no, I'm good. - Hey, that's for us. Shut it. No, I'm good, thank you. I need the garage clicker. Oh yeah, of course. Of course, where is it? One of those things that, you know, you should really put in a safe place every time, 'cause that is where you find it. But um, - ow. - Careful. That's sharp. I'm fine, really. Right here. Here you go. Thanks. - Great. - I'll be working on the fountain if you need me. Of course. What? Hey, Daddy's here. Oh. You're early. Dada. - Traffic was light. - Mmm. Did you boys do your homework? - Course it was. - Did you practice - your violin, Dave? - No, and no. And I tried. I really tried, so that's on you now. It's all good, buddy. Grab your hoodies, boys, it's zoo day. They really ate none of their breakfast. What's up with your mom? She's been texting me a ton. It's been kind of weird. Didn't they make her start some meds? Yeah, well she feels that she doesn't need them. It's everybody else that's crazy. Well, you told her to stop calling me. - Thank you. - Uh huh. But now she needs to stop texting me. We've been divorced for a year. All right, yeah. I get it. Hey, boychiks, kisses for Mama. I'm gonna miss you. - Bye, Mama. - Bye. Have so much fun at the zoo. - See ya. - Snacks for them? Yes. Okay. - Bye, mama. - Of course you have snacks. Jesus Christ. Ma, what? Call the caregiver agency. I gotta fire another one. No, no, no, no, no, Mom, not Shawn. What's going on? Oh, wait till you hear this one. Shawn, you were brought into this house to protect him, not to bring him poison. Mrs. Frey, it's not poison. - Medicinal marijuana. - Oh please. Has been proven to help- - Who do you think you're talking to? I went through the '60s. Barely. I was taking mescaline before you were even in diapers. So give me a break. He asked me for it. It is a drug and I don't want it in my house. Mrs. Frey, I care about your family. Very deeply. Spare me the pain. Just get out, Shawn. In fact, get out and take your bears with you. Whoa, whoa, Mom, stop. - I want you out. - Shawn, what's happening? Mom, stop with the bears. I can't do this. - We can talk. - I'm sorry. Remember the last time? Hey, stop it. I'll call you. This turnover is killing me. What did he do? Well, he was giving your father marijuana in the form of cute little bears. Oh my God, mom. He was one of the good ones. Call the service, get another one. I'm very happy we have this appointment today because he's getting worse. Ma, this is how this works. It gets worse. And this morning he fell again, and I could barely pick him up. He was like a dead weight. Shawn? I need Shawn. Hey, honey. Hi, Dad. Hi. Hi. I need to pee. - Okay. - Okay. Abby. Your dad needs your help. But I'm in a hurry. I'll be in the car. Whoopsy daisy, too late. Huh. Cut it out. Dad said not to make noise. Shut up. I'm serious, Nathan. Cut it out. Cut it out. - He's gonna be mad. - "He's gonna be mad." Hey! Abby, what did I tell ya? So, I can't seem to get my balance. Everything seems to be- - Follow my finger, please. - Everything is failing on me. I feel a little weak. Just with the eyes. - Huh? - How's work? It's fine. When are they going to tell you about that cover story? I just don't think they think I'm quite ready yet. Well, that's ridiculous. I mean, you didn't get an MFA to be writing staff pieces this long. Veronica's daughter-in-law has an MSA and she says you absolutely should have a cover now. Great, well I am not Veronica's daughter-in-law. You have to say what you want, Abigail. It's not quite like that, Ma. This point, there's really nothing else to do, I'm afraid. Nothing else to do? Abigail, help me out here. I don't think Dr. Ashkenazi understands. It's Ashkenazi, Mom. It's fine. We need another set of tests. We need, we need a specialist. - He is a specialist. - I am a specialist. Dr. Ashkenazi. Your next patient's ready. Excuse me? - Ma. - She serious? I'll be right there. Doctor, I've been trying to tell my parents that it's not safe for them to be living on their own without full-time care. We don't need it. You call me every time he falls. Not true. I called 911 twice this week. Mrs. Frey, you need to consider hiring a full-time caregiver. You're going to end up hurting yourself. We need a fourth opinion. The thing about life is that there are no second chances to be the you that you're meant to be. What's holding you back? Now is the time for you to break through those limits. Whoa. Shit. You're good. You're good. You have to be willing to take a risk and take that step. 'Cause no one else is going to do it for you. You have to work. Now is the time. It's all about you taking that next step. Visualize yourself and who you wanna become. You have to take control. You've reached the voicemail of Hannah White, Editor-in-Chief of Modern Jew. Leave a message, I'll return your call. Hey, boss lady. Hannah Banana. I'm sorry, but you know, just little busy. This is Abigail Frey, by the way. So listen, so many things to say, my dad's dying. I mean, everybody is dying, but some quicker than others. And my mom is not, I mean, can I petition for a new mom? There's some fun stuff to talk about. There's this guy, a man, gardening my garden and he is delightful. So we can talk about that. About haircuts. I need one. Bangs, no bangs? I mean... So, give me a call whenever. I'm here. Dance clubs just giving it their all today. Whoa, look at those kicks. These girls worked so hard all year just to get a chance to walk. Ma. Ma. Ma? What? - What, I'm fine. - We're almost ready. I needed to take a little nap. Where's your father? He's not up yet. Eugene, what are you doing? Your brother said he would call with Karen. I told him, you know, come have a meal with us, but she's sure has her claws in him, doesn't she? Mom, can we just go one day without you tearing into Karen? Excuse me. Look, who's a saint. What do you think? Why are you wearing those shoes? I'm in a good mood. Can't I be in a good mood? It's a new year. - Oh man. - What? All right, here's why I'm in a good mood. It's New Year's, it's vacation, I don't have to work tomorrow, and I just got stoned. Happy New Year, Barbara. What? - What? - No. What? I've been denying this for 20 years. I am so sick and tired. I ain't going to deny it anymore. I smoke weed. Come on, let's eat. Abby, sit down. Abigail, do not touch that chair. Abby, sit down, let's eat. - Right. - Ooh. Ooh. Ooh, look what you've made for me. It's my favorite. It's pasta primavera. Oh, oh. - Thank you. - I know that. What? - Aw, shit. - Now you can make your own dinner for the rest of your fucking life. Oh, Barbie, give it a fucking break. You drink, you drink, you drink, I smoke a joint. What? Peter, this stupid fucking bookcase. - Hi, Dad. - Hi. - How are you? - Okay. What are you doing out here? Where's Darrin? Darrin? Meeting, I think, us at the doctor. Okay. Your mother said that I should stay here 'cause I was too much in the way. I hate being such a burden. Abigail, you're here already. - Here I am. - Do you know I have just made the most incredible flatbread? I used those dry chickpeas from the Armenian market. The one the seamstress at the dry cleaner told us about, the dry cleaner who's having an affair with her hairdresser, but who still reads your column. That is so kind. All right, let's get Dad to this appointment. We're gonna do it in the walker. Why? Well, he's got to try it. - I can try it. - Yeah. Let me take this. Dad, I think you should use the wheelchair. - He can try the walker. - I could try it. Ma, he's very weak. Honey, it's okay. I'm okay. I know what I'm doing. Okay, let's try the walker. - Okay. - All right. Not too fast. Yeah, that's it. Uh oh. - Uh oh. - How you feel? Not too good. Come on, we'll go back down. Okay. - There. - Okay, Abigail. Whoa, hey. I will take care of this. This stupid thing. All right. Want me to do this? No, I can do it. Yeah, but I don't have my feet ready. Oh. Oh, shoot. Sorry. Sorry. Oh God. I don't like you to bend. I know, I'm sorry. Okay, great. Don't let her bend. Okay, Dad. You sure you don't want- - No, I'm good. - Okay. You know, Darrin's girlfriend is 20 and she's pregnant. How are we going to stop this endless cycle? - Watch out. - Whoopsy daisy. I'm fine, Abigail. I'm fine. Everybody's fine. Did you get a chance to look at that dating app? 'Cause it's time. Peter's already seeing people. How on earth do you know that, Ma? Well, you told me I couldn't call him and I couldn't text him, but you didn't say I couldn't follow him on Facebook. Can we just pay attention to what the doctor is saying? Sorry. Okay. Mr. Frey, let's see how you can walk on your own. Walking is hard for me. Dad, it's okay, we're all here for you. Let me get you started Mr. F. - Whoa. - Whoa. He's like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Ma. Okay, Mr. Frey, let's try that again. You're all right. I got you, Mr. F. Now. How are you, Mrs. Frey? How should I be, Dr. Pastel? It's Dr. Patel, Mom. It's fine. Abigail. I would like you to tell Dr. Patel about your father. She has training in medicine. I took a couple of courses in college, just basic stuff. Now she's writing. She's writing a column for the Modern Jew. It's very popular, but because she doesn't ask for what she wants, she hasn't been given a cover story yet. - Ma. - Right. He's not been eating. He wets the bed most nights. He's really not very lucid. And he is getting worse day by day. His chiropractor thinks maybe meditation would help. Mm-hmm. Mrs. Frey, I'm going to be blunt. I know you're continuing to make appointments weekly, but your husband is not going to get better. So, do you mean we brought him to a doctor, to a hospital, where they can't fix him? Mom. He's gonna continue to decline at a more rapid rate now. And we need to talk about hospice. Hospice. What is that? Hospice means we don't think he can live longer than six months. He's gotta eat more. Maybe if you gave him an enema, it would make room for more food. No, Mrs. Frey. You have to stop trying to force him to eat. If he doesn't eat, he's gonna die. Yes, Ma, he's going to die. Oh my God. We just figured out his Lipitor. Ma, what? We finally figured out the dosage and now he's going to die. Ma, now is not the time to be thinking about his Lipitor, okay? Nathan used to work in that building. Remember? We visited him once, and I think we took a very nice walk in the garden there. - Remember? - Yeah. I remember. Get back here. Cut it out. Do you wanna tap out? No, I do not wanna tap out. Guys, take this in another room. If you really love him, then you'll save him. She does love me. And she will save me. Guys, other room, please. - Get back here, you troll. - Don't call me a troll, - you troll. - I'm not done with you. Hey, Abbs. Sorry I haven't answered your calls. Here's the thing. I don't know if I want Mom and Dad at my birthday party next week. No matter what I do, I can't get space from them. - Get what? - What, space? What does that mean? You know what it means. Remember when we sent the thing. Oh, yes, yes, yes. Such disrespect when he did that. If I would have told my father- - Oh, Eugene, stop with the father. It's not always about your father. Okay, hey, do you want me to finish or not? Yeah, go. Okay. Karen's parents so generously offered to throw me this party. Oh, I know what's comin'. - You do? - Oh yeah. Just listen, go ahead. I think you all coming to my party without mom apologizing to Karen - for what happened. - What? Is not gonna work. There it is, I knew it. Are you kidding? - That's it. - Ma, what happened with Karen? Oh please. Her grandmother turned 100. I didn't go to the celebration because I can't be all things to all people, Abigail. You're absolutely right. Thank you. Okay, Ma, can you just apologize to Karen? Apologize? Wh, why? We're not apologizing. It was a busy week. Sue me. Over my dead fuckin' body. Over my dead fuckin' body is anyone in this family fucking apologizing to go to that fucking party? I think we should say hello. - Now? - Yeah. I talked to them. - I told them. - And? They had to be polite. Okay. - Hello, family. - Happy birthday. - Okay, thank you. - Hi, Karen. Mom, Dad. Nathan, happy birthday. Thanks. Dad? Have you put on a little weight? You're still a troll. I swear if you ask me one more time, I am going to throw you into a wall. Just cut it out. You're so annoying. Can you bring us a snack please, Mom? Yes, I'll be right there. I'll be right there. Okay. God, I- Hello? Hey, what's up? I just, uh, I wanted to talk to you about Dad. He has a degenerative condition and we've had to put him on hospice. Oh, okay. Yeah. I don't really know what else to say. Well, I'm glad you told me. If you wanted to start thinking about, you know um, if you, I don't know. It might be the last. Yeah, no, I get it. I get it. I am sorry. I know you're probably at work and so you probably need time to think about this. No, no, it's fine. I mean, I kind of have a good amount of distance from all of this. It's been so long, so I'll be down there in a couple of weeks. - What? - Yeah. I'm the distinguished lecturer at the College of Art and Design, the horticulture of the Meiji era. Being a specialist matters, I guess. Yeah, I'm sure. So, I mean, I don't want to commit to anything, but- - But there's a chance you might come see him? Well, I don't know, Abigail. I'm just saying I'll be down there. It's a long drive. So it depends on timing and- - Yeah, okay. - Bunch of stuff I have to do. Should I come? What? You know, to your lecture? Should I come? What? No, nevermind. No, yeah. Come. That's cool. Yeah? Yeah, I'll send you the information. Okay. Okay, bye. Bye. Mom? Yes, I'm coming. Yeah, we have had conversation. This is what, my job is an hour away from here. It makes no sense for me to live at home anymore. Come on. Oh, don't come on with me, kid. I worked my ass off so you can live here rent-free. - Dad. - What? Calm down. Don't tell me to calm down. I'm fuckin' calm, Abby. - This is calm. - You want things to be like they were when you were my age. And it's just not like that anymore. Well, when I was your age, if I would've told my father I want to live on my own, but he should keep paying my rent, he would have smacked me so hard I'd have lost all the teeth in my head and I woulda deserved it, kid. Karen and I are getting serious. - Karen! - Karen, who? Who is? - My girlfriend. - Is she behind the whole moving thing? - What? - You think that we don't get what's going on, Nate? We do. We know you want to live in some bachelor pleasure den. Oh, Ma, stop. Shut up, Abby. You think I want to move out so I can have sex - with Karen? - Yeah. Well, news flash, we already have. - What? - Oh Jesus. Oh God. Everyone has sex. You're the only people who refuse to acknowledge that because you're so out of touch with reality. It's like you're living in the Dark Ages. Do not yell at your mother. I'm so Sick of your authoritarian bullshit, Dad! I'm warning you. Nathan, your father is - busting his ass- - Stop, stop, stop defending him. You gave up your life to be his servant. And I am tired of shutting up about the fact that you love him more than you love us. Stop, stop, Dad, please. Where are you goin'? Where are you goin'? Get out of here! Talking to your mother like that. Get out. Get out of here, get out of here. - You're not so smart, Nathan. - Get outta here. - Fuckin' dicks, man. - You don't know anything. - You're flinchin', huh? - Get out of, get the hell out. Where you goin'? - I just- - No, you're not goin' anywhere, we're gonna have dinner. Okay. So, what should we talk about? Abby? Have a nice day today? Ah. Hello. Hi. You're early. Hello, Miss Abigail. You could call me Abby at this point. Abby. - Short for Abigail. - Yeah, no, I got it. Of course you do. I mean, I'm pretty sure I said it'd be around noon. And look at that. It is noon. - It is. - Thought it was not, but it is. Can I take this out for you? Trade you my empty water bottle for the trash? Sure, but I can fill this with water for you. That is the thing that could happen. - Mm-hm. - Mm-hm. - Yup. - Yup. Well, I will be right back. Okay. All right. Here you go. - Thank you. - No problem. So, cupcakes. Uh huh. Yup, that is what I am doing. Uh, Mom, I can't really talk right now - because I have people over. - Oh my God, did you know if you sleep with your mouth open and don't swallow enough, you get sores in your mouth? Mom. Your father has so many sores. Mom, Mom. - Mom. - Because his swallow reflex is so messed up. Ma I can't talk right now. I have somebody over here. - Okay? - Oh. Since, when do you have people there? - Ma, I was just. - Hey. Hello there, muscles. Hello yourself. I'm Jay, the landscaper. You really don't have to do this. Oh, I don't mind. I see where Abigail gets her good looks. - Oh wow. - Jay, flattery will get you everywhere. I've got some landscaping I could use some help with. Oh my God, I want to die. - Just a sec. - Okay, okay. Abigail, your father needs that stuff that makes water easier to swallow. He's gagging and drooling. Ma, I'm gonna call you back later. Okay? Mm. Moms, right? Yeah, that's one way to put it. Ma, are our cupcakes done yet? Yeah. I'm working on it. - Sorry. - Don't be. I'll get outta here. - Get to work. - Okay. Jay? - Yeah? - I, huh, you might not want to do this, but I have some extra tickets to this lecture on magical Japanese gardens. You know, you are a landscaper. Meiji era is what this is about. And you know, maybe you might- - Wow, that is a very specific topic. I know. Yeah, sure, sounds good. When is it? Tomorrow? Tomorrow? What, you think I had no other plans? Yeah, I'm sure you do. No, I don't have any other plans. Okay. Okay. I should also tell you that the lecturer is my brother. He's a professor and this is his specialty. So it is going to be him there. I haven't seen him in a long time, so it's kind of a big deal. Wow, so first I flirt with your mom, now you want me to meet your brother? Yeah, I'd like you to forget about that. But this might be a terrible idea as well. So just don't worry about it. You know what? Let's add in sushi before and it's a deal. Okay. Okay. - Great. - Cool. - Okay. - Okay. The forest was caps. You're talking silly talk. I worked so goddamn hard, for every day of my fuckin' life, and this is the thanks I get? Abby. Abby, Abby, honey. Sweetie, sweetie pie, wake up. Wake up, wake up. Come on, we gotta get up. - What's goin' on? - We gotta go. We gotta go, put your shoes on. Why? Come on. 'Cause we have to. Hurry up. I'm gonna get Nathan. Come on, sweetie, come on. - Okay. - Okay. Barbara, you are such a selfish cunt. I don't need any of this shit. Oh, you're taking them away. Go ahead. Go ahead, see if I fuckin' care. Daddy just needs to cool off. You know how he gets. He's under a lot of stress at work. Okay, you guys, I'll see you in the morning, sweetie. - No. - I love you. No. Don't go. Love you. - Nate? - What? - Where's the moon? - What? Where is it? It's not in the sky. Oh. It's called a new moon. Go to sleep. Are Mom and Dad gonna be okay? I don't know, sis. I don't know. Go to sleep. Hey, there you are. Hi. I am so sorry that I am late. I'd like to tell you that I'm not typically late, but I am always late and it is not because I value my time more than yours. It's just, I put things places, and then I can't find them, things that are important like the keys. I'm sorry. It's okay. - Hi. - Hi. I'm gonna get started here. Please take your seats. Well, feel like I'm back in college. Thought you didn't go to college. Wow, not used to dates who listen. Here today. You can you can hear me, right? - This is on- - God. I'm Nathaniel Frey. I mean, he looks exactly like my dad. The College of Art and Design is very close to my heart. So let's just jump in. If we can get the lights. The Meiji Period is one which has. Okay, so what do we do? This is who they are. Nathan, you should have heard what she was saying in there. Abby, you have to get yourself out of there. - Nate. - One sec. Abbs, I gotta go. Get out of there. What am I suppose to do? How am I supposed to? - Nathan. - Do what you need to, do what you need to. - I gotta go. - Nathan. Is best left to the gods and not the gardeners. I'll meet you at the car? Okay. Good luck. - Okay. - So thank you guys. Hey. Do we hug? Okay. That was so cool to see you in action. You're so passionate. Thank you, thank you. You're just really well versed and all. Yeah, they asked me to do this lecture and I was like, I just did this at the University of Tokyo. So I wasn't even sure I wanted to come. But there's not many of us with this level of expertise. Of course. So, is now a good time to talk about Dad? Sure. - Yeah. - Okay. So just so we're clear here, I'm not generally curious about our parents. If I was, I wouldn't have chosen to stay out of their lives for the past 20 years. But, um, do you want to tell me how he is? Like for you? So much has happened since you left. Dad was hospitalized a few years ago, mental breakdown, diagnosis bipolar. And Mom, I mean, she's never been formally diagnosed, but you know it's very borderline personality disorder. Okay, so now these things have names. He's like bad, Nathan. I mean, he can't stand up on his own. He's refusing to eat. This really is it. So if there's any part of you that wants to see him, now would be the time. I don't think I can go see him. Yeah. - I'm sorry. - Okay. No. Thanks for coming. Yeah. It's because of her. - What? - I don't want to see her. I don't, I really don't want to see her. Okay. Can I ask you why? Yeah. His wreckage was tangible. Hers was so insidious and disturbing. I just can't go there. Okay. What if she wasn't there? What? What if she wasn't there? - Wow. - Yeah. That's a good start for you. So your life is just always kind of like this emotion, this intensity? You havin' to fix everything? Yeah. Yeah, it's all I know. But this, I mean, how am I supposed to tell my mother that she can't be there when her son, who she hasn't seen for 20 years, visits her husband who is dying. I just, I don't know how to tackle that one yet. But I've got to fix it. I said I'd fix it. Well, I kind of fix for a living. And I can tell you this, things will keep breaking. So what are you gonna do? I'm so sorry. - It's okay. - I really wanna do this. It's okay. Just in case something. Oh, say hi for me. - Who's that? - Nobody. It's me, the landscaper. Oh, Jed. Jay. What are you crazy kids up to? I'm not, Ma, let me call you tomorrow. - Okay? - Okay. And Jeff, make sure to come to Eugene's birthday party next week. It's likely the last one he'll ever have. - Mom. - I would love to, but my parents are going to be in town from Oakland. So he has plans. - Plans. - Great. Bring them too. - The more, the merrier. - Oh, God in heaven. No, Ma. It's a party, Abigail. Don't you want to celebrate your father's last birthday and let him see you finally got a date? Okay, Ma, I'm calling you tomorrow. - Bye, love you. - Goodbye. Bye. What are you doing? Securing the weirdest second date ever. - Truly. - Truly. Like being around you. This isn't too much? It's so messy. That's not how I see it. My mom gets weird at parties. Her behavior is not a reflection on me. Today is about my dad. I can do for an hour, what I couldn't do for a lifetime. I am not her. She is not me. Okay, party people. Let's do this. Where is the... birthday boy? Hi. Hello. - How are you? - Good. Darrin, Dad, this is Jay. Hello, Mr. Frey. Hi. - Hi. - Sup. All high fives and handshakes and. This is Billy and Marge, sorry, Marge and Billy. These are Jay's parents and they're celebrating with us because they are in town. - How are you, Mr. Frey? - Happy birthday. Where's the dad? - Hi, Ma. - Hi. Hello. Hello, welcome. Can I get you a drink? We have mimosas. Come on, Jed. Jay, Mom. I'm sorry. It's okay. Okay. - The father didn't come? - Dad. So how is your day? Oh. It's been up and down. We took a nice walk in the park, right Mr. F? Okay. Just okay? Come on, we saw a three legged dog. We checked out the ladies. We saw the little kid who fell on his face when he tripped on that sprinkler. We laughed a little bit. What? - It was funny. - Oh my God. Laughing at little kids falling down. - Speaking of little kids. - Hi, Mom. Hello. Oh, are you having a good day? Missed you. - Hi. - Hi. Hiding in the back room? Your mom was having a moment or three. Uh-huh, yeah. Along with her mimosa or three. I'm sorry. You're supposed to talk to her about drinking - in front of the boys. - I know. I just. It needs to happen. I will do it. Hi, Jay. Hey, Peter. Good to see ya. Hey fellas. When is cake time? ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Eugene ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - Happy birthday, dad. - Blow 'em out, Mr. F. I'd say it went pretty well. I wish Nathan was here. All right. Let's get this cake served. Nice piece for you, Eugene. - I don't want it. - Yes, you do. - You love this cake. - No, I don't want it. - You do. - I don't. I don't want it. - Yes you do, Eugene. - No, I don't. Yes, you do. Come on, Eugene. God dammit. I don't, please. - Ma. - Mommy, maybe he's not hungry. No, that is not an option. It's his birthday. He has to eat his cake. Okay, you know what, Mrs. F? Maybe you should back off. Let's just take a walk. It's his favorite cake. He loves it. We're all going to enjoy it together, God dammit. You know what, Mrs. F? I'm just asking you to stop. Darrin, I don't recall asking your opinion. Just know your place. - Okay, know your place. - Oh, hell no. Darrin, I'll handle this. - Abigail? - Yes? I think we're just gonna grab a ride, but I'll call you. All right, I'll call you. That's just, okay. - Thank you. - Honey, hush. Let's just get out of here. We can talk about this later. Why are you sending them away? Because, Ma. You know what, Dad? Let's get you down to take a nap. You've had a big day. Let's get you down okay. You just broke up the party. Hey Darrin, can I borrow you for a second? Yeah, of course. - Can you help? - Yeah. Thanks, I got the chair. - I got ya, Mr. F. - Hey, hey, hey. No one naps until they eat their cake, Darrin. We're gonna go. Come on, Dad. If it were my last birthday on Earth, I would eat this cake. Daddy. Sit down, sit down. I need to talk to you. Dad, I really don't- - You know your mom and I had a big fight, right? She doesn't like me smoking pot. You know, it's not like I'm hurting anybody. It's not like something I don't have complete control over. I'm thinking of moving back to the city. What? No, but I came out here because your mom wanted to, I wanted to stay there because that's where the energy is. I'm an artist, Abby. I'm a writer, I want to write the great American novel. - Dad. - But there's no energy here. Dad, just- - My psychiatrist says that if he were me, he would blow his fuckin' brains out if he had a wife who was this frigid and a son who wouldn't talk to him. There's no love for me here, Abby. How could you say that to me? I'm here. I love you. Have you spoken to your brother? No. My Abby, my Abby, my Abby. You know me better than anybody. You always have. You know me better than your mother. That's for sure. Thank you. I gotta go to the bathroom. Hey. Hey. He's asleep. He's asleep? He is, yeah. Okay. I didn't know my cake would become such a big part of the evening. The cake was delicious, Ma. I know it was. I spoke to Nathan. You called him? I did. He wants to see Dad. Wow. Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. Yeah. When, wh, when does he want to come? He can come tomorrow. Oh God. Oh, well, huh, soon. But, uh, here's the thing. He is not ready to see you yet. Huh. Hah. And, and why would that be? I don't know. 'Cause he just wants to keep things really simple. Yeah, sure. I know this is hard for you. Hah. Yeah. This is something that you would do for Dad. Yeah. Are you good? Oh, good, I'm feeling good. Fine, fine. And you're gonna let him see- - Oh yeah. I wouldn't stand in his way. Sure. Hey Abby, Hannah White. Listen, I got your message. You don't really sound like you're stable right now. Hey Abby, it's Jay. So, I know you're in a really rough place. Time off. I think you should take that sabbatical we talked about. After the whole party cake thing, you just gotta- - Let me know when you're ready to talk from a more centered perspective. Hit pause for a minute. The garden's at a good stopping place, so let's touch base in a bit, okay? - Take care of yourself. - Take care. Abbs, I gotta go. Get out of there! You have to get yourself out of there! - Nathan. - Do what you need to, do what you need to. - I have to go. - Nathan. You ready? Mm-hm. All right, Mr. F? It's the moment you've been waiting for. Thanks for the shower. I got you. Your little man's all grown up and he comin' to see you. Nathan. Yeah, we got you looking pretty fly if I do say so myself. Give me some. There you go. That was good enough. Don't you look handsome? You're welcome. - Hi. - Hey, Dad. How are you feeling? Nervous. Good though. - Nerve is good. - You ready? Oh. Hello, Nathan. Hello. I never thought I'd live to see the two of you together again. I'll leave you two to catch up. No. - Stay. - Stay. - Stay. - Okay. So Nate, how is, how are you? And how is, it's, I know, don't tell me. - Karen. - Karen. How's Karen? Good. Everything is really good. Good. I came down to give a lecture on the Meiji Restoration at the College of Art and Design. - Oh. - He was wonderful. We actually just got back from a road trip to all the national parks of Utah. Utah? Yeah. Bryce, Zion, Arches. I had great memories from those trips you took us on, like Yosemite. You got me the T-shirt with the space, it looked like yo-semite. - Dad? - Yeah? Everything good about me is because of you. You encouraged me to love art and to make a living surrounded by art. Thank you. Nate. You got to live a life I never could. I, I tried to give you the best life I could. I tried. You tried. Yes. - Dad. - What? What else do you want to say to Nathan? When do I get to see him again? I don't know, Dad. What? I'd love a photo of the three of us. Darrin, can you help us for a second? Wouldn't that be great? How long do you think he's going to sleep for? That was a lot for him. I know. He'll be out for a while. He's sleeping more and more. Hey. You know, I'm gonna go ahead and sit with Mr. F. Hey. How'd it go? It went well. Took a picture. Do you want to see? Sure. There you go. Wow, ooh. Whew. That is totally weird. What's weird? Your brother, he's all bloated. Why did he get so bloated? What? Oh God, and his eyes are puffy. That's not what I see in it, Ma. Well, no, but I see him here, he looks like somebody who's on that medication for the inflamed kishkas, what is that thing called? - The kishkas. - Colitis. Yeah, colitis is what, exactly, he looks like someone with colitis. He probably has colitis. Okay, well that is our photo and, yeah it went well. Good. Glad to hear it. What have you been up to? Oh, well, I have been on a toilet seat at a coffee shop. Fun. Okay. Okay. Did he mention me? It didn't really come up. Ah. Let me see that picture again. Let me see it. Okay. Hmm. Well, you look beautiful, but he does not look like your brother. I mean, really. It's like a interloper. Okay. Okay. Abbs? Yeah, Dad? Sometimes when I close my eyes, I see things. What do you see? I see your boys. I see Davis running the bases in softball. I never got to see him play one game. That's okay. I see him running the bases and Finn is running right behind him. Sometimes I see your mother. Yeah? She looks the way she did when we first met. How's that? When she was 16. She looks beautiful, she's so beautiful. I worry about her. Why is that? That she won't be okay, that she'll miss me. I never meant that I could do anything without her. And now I'm gonna die without her. All I want is to be with her forever. Do you ever tell her that? Oh, I couldn't tell her that. You just did. Is that you? You're my world. You know? Do you know? Hey. How's he doing today? Has he eaten? Ice chips. He's startin' his transition to a place where you won't need any food, he won't feel any pain. It's a place of the spirit. Come here. You've been so good to him. No, it's okay. Thank you. You're such a good daughter. He's so loved. It's okay. To begin with, no. Let me call attention to the fact that the ones hunting us are young male adults. - I'm thirsty. - Thirsty? Of his culture. You caught me. Do you get it? No. How's that? Little more. - Okay. - Little more. Okay. Okay. Abbs. Abbs. Athan. Nathan? No. - No? - No. Hi, this is Nathan, leave a message after the beep. Wait for the beep. Wait for the beep. Hold on, here it comes. Beep, that wasn't it. I can go get it. I'll get it. No, honey, you shouldn't be getting his morphine. - I'll be right back, Ma. - That's his job. Ma, I'd like Darrin to be here in case anything happens, okay? Okay. Can I have a minute? Hey, Dad. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna be right back. I know how much pain you're in. If you wanna go while I'm gone, that's okay. That's okay. I promise it's okay. I love you the most. I know you know that. Hey. It's good you called. I'm happy to help. Hey, what's going on? Abigail, he isn't breathing. Abigail, he was breathing a minute ago. Should we call 911? No. No, that's not how this works. We don't call 911. That's not how this works. We do nothing. Ma, can you hear me? Okay. Have you recited the Shema? No. Repeat three times, Sh'ma Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad. Sh'ma Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad. Sh'ma Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad. Sh'ma Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad. Baruch shem kevod malchuto le'olam va'ed. Baruch shem kevod malchuto le'olam va'ed. Baruch dayan ha-emet. Baruch dayan ha-emet. All right, I'll see you soon. Turn around. What do you mean they have to take him away? Can't he sleep here? Ma, they have to take him. Our wedding color was green. Abby, what was that? The power, Ma. For the hairdryer. I don't think so. It's never happened before. I think it was him. Ma, it's not him. That's not how this works, okay? What else could it have been? Is Nathan coming today? Ma, I'm gonna the fix fucking power for your fucking hairdryer, okay? No Nathan. Abigail, I was just asking. And watch your mouth. I'm sorry. I just, I haven't heard from him and I'm dealing with a lot of things and I just don't, sorry. It's okay, Eugene. Oh my God. Is that what you're going to wear? What? Do you want to borrow something? Or are you good like this? Yes. Do you want me to help you blow dry your hair? - No. - Okay, just asking. Thank you. You want me to look nice. It's time for Keriah. We are going to tear a cloth ribbon. Did you want to tear your ribbon instead? No. Okay. Okay. I would like to tear a ribbon. Of course. It goes over here. Not over the heart? Only for the child. Spouses tear over the right side. Well, I'm in as much grief as she is. Eugene said when he saw this dress, "That is so depressing. It looks like something you're gonna wear to my service." And here I am. Hyman, thank you for coming. - Oh dear. - Does Nathan know? Oh, I think so. But he did not come. That's horrible. You're really committing to those chin pubes, huh? I am all testosterone. Disgusting. Talking 'bout you? I agree. - Hi, guys. - Hi, Mom. Oh. You look so pretty. - Thank you. - You think so? Nate. You want more eye shadow? You think I need it? No. I think you look perfect. - Thanks, Ma. - Oh, there you are. Barb, I was looking for you. Hi, guys. - Good morning. - What's going on? This isn't a party. - Ah! - Oh, Eug! Don't say anything, I'll take the blame. Oh, come on. That was so violent. Get out of here. - Dad! - On the double. And how about Suzy Lifla? Could you believe the weight she put on? She's become a beluga, and she doesn't even dress to help herself. And Albert Gold with the goiter on his neck. - Oh. - Ma. - What? - Could you stop? We just buried Dad. And you're gossiping about all the people who came here to support you. How dare you speak to a mourner like that, Abigail. I'm mourning too. Yes, but you are not his wife. There's a difference. You hardly acted like one. What? I hardly acted like a wife? You don't know the half of what went on. Stay out of other people's business, Abigail. You are constantly dragging me into your business. And I am happy to fix everything that you break. I have no time for myself ever to do anything. Oh, but you had time to ruin your marriage. Look at you, Abigail. You are a wreck. Yeah, Ma. How else do you expect me to be? Hmm? How do you expect me to take care of myself when you never give me any room to do it? Oh, room? You want room? Oh, well go learn from your brother. Nathan. What? She's mad at me. Abby, go away. Nathan. Please. I made her mad and she won't feed me. Please. I'm hungry and my hair's a mess. I need your help. Why can't Dad help you? I don't know where he is. Come here. Nathan. Abby. What are you doing here? I had to bury our father today. I know. I shouldn't have had to do that alone. Abby, I couldn't do it. I shouldn't have had to deal with all of the things that I've had to deal with alone. Yeah, but the question is not why. I didn't stick around to deal with that shit. - Why did you? - Because I had to. Somebody had to, Nathan. You know that somebody had to stay. - Shhh. - And I, I have slept with all the responsibility. I had to make all the big decisions, I had to fix, solve, mend every fucking thing that they did. - I needed you. - Going to some ancient ritual with a bunch of bullshit in Aramaic - does not matter. - That's not it. - That's not it. - Dad wasn't even religious. You lost the plot. You're a martyr. You're a fucking punching bag. That's what you fucking are. You're a fucking doormat. And you want me to be that too, huh? I freed myself. Oh. Oh, you know what? I know what you carry. What I carry? You're as sick as I am. You're as sick as they made us. I see it all over you. I just- - Hey. I need those days, Abigail. Yeah, but that was gonna be my weekend. I know, but we pride ourselves on being flexible with our schedule, and I'm asking this year. I'll think about it. What's to think about? It's no big deal. I'm asking for your help here. Peter, I have plans. I'm not gonna change my plans. Hey guys, come on. - Mom. - Show her the flowers. We got flowers. Oh, you did such a good job. Thank you. My little garden gnomes. - Hi, Dad. - Hi, Dad. Hey guys, let's wash your hands, because I see the food's ready. And if you guys would like any help in washing up, I'm here. - Ma. - Yeah. I can't with you. - Shut it. - Listen. I know. I can't with her. She's just... - Oh wow. - What? Is your mom texting you from the bathroom? It's Nathan. He sent me an invitation. Some very creative combing. Whoa. Finn, ew! You are disgusting. God. Oh my God. Did I ever tell you what Zaide likes to say? Don't say anything, I'll take the blame. He used to think it was the most hilarious thing. He never told you that? - No. - I don't think so. You're missing out. It was a good one. Come on, let's go. Don't want to be late. Who are those people? That's my brother, Nathan. Remember I showed you his photo? His wife, Karen, son Dylan, and his daughter, Amelia, whose party it is, and they are coming over. - Hi. - Hi. This is Dylan. Dylan, this is my sister. Hi Dylan, it's nice to meet you. These are my sons, Finn and Davis. Say hi, boys. - Handshakes. - Hi. It's okay. Hi. I'm Nathan. - Hi. - Hello. - Hi, Abigail. - Hi, Karen. Karen, Amelia. Amelia, congratulations. Come on, boys. Let me show you around. - Come on in. - Go ahead. It's okay. Nice party. Yeah. What, is this awkward? Nathan. No, it's awkward. You'll get there.
