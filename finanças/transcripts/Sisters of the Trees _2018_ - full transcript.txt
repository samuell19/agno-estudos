. What are you doing? No use telling him. Kanha, look at this. See, this house... This was your grandfather's home. Grandfather. -Mine Was it your house? - Yes. And where was the kitchen? - Here. Show me. There. This is the kitchen? Heera, come here. See. Hey, Heera. Open it. Should I? - Yes, open it. Watch out for insects. It's full of chaff. - Move in. Do you see... anything? - No light...

Brother, move to the other side. Be careful. Shift a little and clean it. You give a hand. Me? - Yes. I will hold it. Oh! Oh! Our father's tools are here - Here it is. Want to enter in? Go in there and see. All right. What's this? - It's nothing. Come back. Bananas, cucumbers, vegetables... Gradually we'll have to leave too. Yes, you are right. Now it's only dust storms. - Nothing else. You won't find such place again. No area like this. - Right. We'll have to leave ultimately. What grandpa did here? My family suffered a lot. He could never wear clothes. There was no shirt to wear. There was no clothes. - Yes, quite less. Mr. Sankru used to give it. he said, I'm his stepbrother. What? - He said... What did he say? - I am his step brother. They have mined this far here. -Yes. See how deep they've mined. Earlier mountains were so tall. Now they are reduced so low. Isn't it? - Yes, they are. Now we will have to sell this house too. Yes, we will have to sell. We have to. We will have to sell it. Apple. - Yes, apple. We had apple trees too. Have to sell everything here. Hello. Yes, Sosar. The meeting we had at 8 o'clock tomorrow it will be held at 5. Because I have to... Yes, I have to go somewhere. Yes. Meeting is to be held at 5. My name is Kala Devi Paliwal. I live in Piplantri My mother passed away... when I was very young. Mostly I stayed with my grandma. She had a fracture which didn't heal. So I looked after her and worked there. Earlier we had a school only till 5th standard. So I could studied only until then. In those days, schools here were only till the 5th. They didn't send girls alone to the city. That's why I studied only up to 5th grade in my village. My name is Bhanwari Devi. My village is Piplantri. My husband's name is Modiram. I have two daughters and a son. My husband works on the marble mines. Turn around. My job... I have a cow and buffalo I look after them and my children. If you have cough don't go to school. Why? Look in the mirror, dear. Why are you coughing? You ate something in school? I was not here... Is that why? Wash your face when you get up. See, how dark you look. Compose yourself. Don't cry. If he had not fallen, he would be fine. He was bedridden after it. It happened about 7-8 months ago. 7-8 months back? - Yes. It must be 8 months now. It's 8th month running now. Yes, he fell down in June. Aunt, why didn't... Lalji's wife, sister Meera come? -She's to deliver. Delivery? - Yes. So she didn't come. - No. Why? Her in-laws are troubling her. Troubling her? - Yes. Why so? She already has 2 daughters. - Oh. What if she delivers a girl again. Oh, they don't want a girl. - Yes. They want a boy. - Yes. Her in-laws have fed her with this wrong idea. Sosar and I will go to her place and make her understand, she should not discriminate against girls. Sons and daughters are equally adorable. - Yes. And explain to her mother-in-law that she shouldn't act like this. The tea is good. - Go and give it to Meethalal. Is he there? Should we go there now? Yes, let's go. Hold on, tea will be ready soon. I am making it. Sister Meera, you are expecting a baby, and we came to know that you are facing problem at home due to your pregnancy. That you already have 2 girls and your in-laws are upset. They are fighting. Why are they troubling you? Everyone from my family is saying there shouldn't be a baby girl, it should be a boy. I have two daughters. So they don't want any girl now? - Yes. What's the reason? If you have daughters you need money to get them married. And as I already have daughters. Oh, so your family thinks a girl is a burden as girl needs to be married, and they've to pay dowry. And a boy would bring in dowry. - Yes. A girl isn't burden. One should love both equally. A girl is never burden. A daughter takes care of two families. Son takes care of just one. Don't consider her a problem. Isn't that right, Sosar? What Kala sister is saying is true. Actually there is no difference between a boy and a girl. So make your in-laws understand it too. That's why when we came to know about it we came here to make them understand about this issue. Why are they saying they don't want a girl? It's because I already have two daughters so a boy is better. So what, what's the problem having a baby girl again? This is what the problem is, but I have no problem. You should not be troubled by this. A girl is as good as a boy. Don't worry at all. - They are equals. If a girl is born to you, I will help you the best I can. Ok? Let's finish it here, man. It's a long stretch. That water flowing down there. Now it is flowing here. Now it will irrigate this tract too. Look. It's here. Place the flat stone here. Fine. It's all right. Just place it properly. Yes, pull it. Bring some more stones. Place it here. My name is Shyam Sundar Paliwal. I am 51 years old. And from the year 2005 to 2010 I was chief of Piplantri village. As the Chief I initiated work on daughters, water, trees and wildlife, today it has grown into a huge Banyan tree. And I look after the Piplantri Project. Is water coming here? - No. Often poor families are under more pressure. They'll have to spend money to get a daughter married. Also, a son and a daughter would be a small family. If they only have daughters it will be a big problem... Families think that a son is a must. You read about it in newspapers that someone has left a girl in an orphanage, abandoned the girl in a hospital or bushes There are such kind of woman too. It's not that they are not there. Hearing such news, I feel our village has improved but not all the villages of India. Hey, Lakhiram-ji! - Yes, sir. Why are you cutting trees? - I am not cutting it. Yes, you have cut it. I did not cut it. - What? Then who did? I said, I didn't chop it. Don't talk nonsense, Lakhiram. Don't lie, you have cut the tree. Sir, someone else might have cut it. - Hey... You cut the tree. The entire village saw it. Tell me the truth, haven't you chopped it? Sir, I didn't... - Did you or not? Answer me! If I don't, I will die hungry. - Don't do that. The amount you earn by chopping it, you'll get more by planting trees. I will still chop them - What? - I will cut. If you cut another tree, you'll be in trouble. If you cut trees then everyone will. - Sir, if I don't, I'll die hungry. Listen to me. Listen! I am listening. If we don't cut, we'll starve. - I am giving you a way out. You won't starve. What you get by cutting trees, you'll get more than that in planting. You can run your family well. With trees around you will have birds, animals.... you'll have fodder for the cattle and farming job. - Yes. We will get water, fruits, vegetables and wood. If all these things are lost, land will be barren. Come to me I will get you a job. - Yes. And you'll be paid good labor. All right, sir. - Don't do such thing again. Yesterday he called, I told you. They are coming the day after tomorrow. -Hmm. How many are coming? -He didn't say. Your phone was switched off then. - Yes. He said he was unable to contact you. People who come for exposure visits here... do they learn anything here or do they just visit? Not hundred percent, but 10 to 20 percent do learn. Even if ten percent people learn from here and implement this model in their villages, then it would be great, Bhanwar Singh-ji. What's the use if they just visit? Out of 50, 5 must be learning something sincerely. A team of teachers with their Head Master had come from Mulund. More children will join in, if we involve more teachers. And if new children join in... our work will progress much more. Flip the chapati. Anything else? - If this job is done then... Oh, no. Don't force it. You had asked me to flip it. - Yes. Okay, let it be. If you can't do it... - Yes, it is okay. It's not grilled properly. - Hand it over to me. See... You said it isn't roasted properly. See how well I did it. Earlier it wasn't done properly. - Hmm. We have to learn it, otherwise there is no escape. Earlier I didn't live here. My entire family lived in Gujarat and we earned our living there. There was no water here. No trees or plants either. Then mining started here in 1980. Then we came back to Rajsamand, and started working in mines here. Water level of our village further depleted. After that, we continued our work and then, in 2005, Mr. Shyam Sunder became the village chief. First of all, he worked on the water issue as our village faced a water problem. He made paved and unpaved trails, ditches and check dams, 4500 such sources that conserve water. At that time, water level of our village was about 500 to 600 feet deep, today it has come up to about 20-25 feet. Farmers faced lots of problems with their work. So when we got the water again, we started working for progress of the girls. If in any house a daughter is born, we will plant 111 trees in her name. Some people thought, if a girl is born in the house, she's a problem. They didn't educate her well. They were worried about her dowry. A son will earn, but a daughter will go to other's family. This thought prevailed in people's mind. And to remove this misconception he initiated the idea that sons and daughters are equal. Hey, monkey is coming down. It's coming down. Arre, it's gone now. Monkeys... All of them are taking eats from you. Not only in Piplantri, but all across Rajasthan women are badly persecuted. And it has been going on for centuries. Due to this, it became a belief that a girl should not be born, and if she does, she should not be left alive. I asked those women, how did you kill the girls? They said, the oldest woman in the house put a small millet grain in the newborn's mouth. Which caused sore throat and she would develop infection and the baby would die in a day or two. Niku is 8 years younger than her brother And there's one and half year's gap between my other sons. I mean, after my first two kids, when I was pregnant again, my mother-in-law wanted another boy. My mother-in-law insisted that I shouldn't get a baby girl. So, we went to some lab outside to get myself checked. The report said it was a baby girl. Only me and my husband were there. But back home we told my mother-in-law it was a boy. Though it was a girl we said it was a boy. We didn't want to commit the sin of foeticide. When Niku was born, we gave away sweets in the hospital. For us, either a girl or boy was fine. After Nikita's birth, we planted 111 saplings. My husband liked to see the plants growing. So he said, let's go and plant the trees. So we went to the nursery and planted there. All were different kinds of saplings. Like this naseberry now... Today it is bearing big fruit. I go there to water the plants. And I enjoy a lot. Everybody has planted different kinds of plants... all of us together. One... Two... Chant "Om". One... Two... At ease. Who is the Collector of Rajsamand? Khushi. Mr. P. C. Berwal. His name is Mr. P. C. Berwal. Mister P. C. Berwal. My name is Leela. I am a Rajput by cast. I got married here in Piplantri. I stay here with my in-laws. My village used to be Puthol. I was studying in 8th grade. But when my father died, I had to give up studies. Then I got married. I will have lunch too. -If needed I'll cook more. I used to go to nursery. After marriage I told my sis-in-law that I wanted to go to nursery and I planted saplings, placed pebbles and stones there. After that I came back home and did all the household work. Initially my husband didn't want me to go to nursery but then my family members convinced him to let me go. They told him that I loved going, so he allowed me. Feed the child. My daughter Sushila was born healthy and I had no problem during delivery. Delivery was normal. I feel very happy when I see my daughter. She is 3 months old now. My family members take good care of my daughter. They don't mistreat her. In some other village they might have mistreated her. She is better off in Piplantri. Piplantri's identity is its daughters, water, and trees. So Piplantri is known for it today and large number of visitors come here. Every girl born in this village, her family and we together plant 111 saplings in her name. So, people from here worked and showed that whatever rainfall this village gets it'll be fed to mother earth. And when mother earth's thirst is quenched, then we shall have the water, ground water will irrupt. Our wells were recharged. Farmers had water in the wells, they started farming again. The wildlife here, like partridges peacocks, hare, panther, monkeys They started returning. Birds started chirping again. This what Piplantri's identity is. Have you seen Vermilion? You know what vermilion is like, A small piece of it can be applied on 200 people. We have such kind of plants too. Here, hold it. Rub it with your thumb. And mark a small dot on her forehead. Come on, do it. On the day of Rakhi festival, The girls who had just come? Krishna. - Yes, Krishna. What happens that day, dear? - Girls tie a bracelet around trees. Many girls come, from this village and from outside, and they tie Rakhi bracelet to trees. They say, as these trees are planted by my parents, Same parents who have nurtured me, so trees are my brothers too. By seeding such feeling in children we are working towards saving the nature. You must have seen it... Let them come forward. Hey, send all the girls in front. Come on, we have to click pictures. Come on, climb over. Come soon, I won't wait for long. Easy. You might trip. My name is Daku Bai. And my village is Piplantri. I go to nursery. I plant trees and water them. I sweep fallen dead leaves. I do all such work. If I find some work outside I also take up that job. I water the plants. Put water pipes there. I do everything. Earlier, there was nothing in Piplantri, like water and so, nothing grew. We faced all the problems. So, If we planted trees, we couldn't water them. There was no water. Pour little water. - Slowly. Don't pour too much water. Come here and empty it. Everything is fine. Is work going on well? - Yes. Any problem? - We're watering, giving fertilizer... But some insects have infected the roots. So we have to get insecticide and spray it on them. This aloe vera here, this one. - Yes. Place it in the pit... - Yes. This aloevera leaf. Now break it like this. And put it in the pit. - Yes. Dig here. Give me the shovel. Yes, remove the soil. Kattu aunt, clear it. See. Move. Sister Leela. We have come here today as you're blessed with a daughter. She is a few months old now. So 111 saplings are to be planted in her name. Do you want to plant them? - Yes. Say it loudly. - Yes, I want to. So we'll plant them during monsoon and not before it. So come with the child during the monsoon. All right? Then you plant 111 saplings in her name. So... Will you come during the rains? - Yes. Saplings will be planted in such a way that by the time she grows up, gets married and goes to her in-law's, the saplings would be fully grown. There is another scheme, called Kiran Bedi Scheme. Where you have to make a fixed deposit in her name. Fixed Deposit? - Yes. A 21,000 rupees deposit. We will arrange a part of it from our group. But you have to deposit 11,000. Will you manage? But I don't have it. Ask your mother-in-law. - Yes, I will ask her. Ask everyone in your family. I mean, if not 11,000 you may have... - A few thousand rupees. So talk to your husband and mother-in-law. This money is for your daughter's future. Will you do it? - Yes. Should we fill the form? - Yes. So you agree to make the deposit. But there are few conditions for it. I'll explain. First you have to get a Stamp Paper. Complete details of you and Sushila will be on the paper. You will sign it and then you have to commit to some points One is, you won't get her married until she's 18 years old. Do you agree? - Yes. Another is, you will let her study as long as she wants Will you? You will not deprive her of education. I won't deprive her. - Ok. Should we go ahead with it? - Yes. These fixed deposits will also help improve our society. This money will go to her when she turns 18 And last, in your family, you will not let infanticide happen. So, Leela, do you agree to all of these? -Yes. So discuss it with everyone. Ask your in-laws, your husband. Then get back to me when you are ready, whenever you meet me or we speak on the phone. So you get ready quickly. Ok? - Yes. One of you come here help with the head load. Bring it here. I had a daughter named Kiran. She died of dehydration. I didn't know how it happened. And... after her death... Habitually, after 12th day of mourning people take us out of the house to the village. So, they brought me and made me plant a sapling in my daughter's name. There were so many people, they had their feelings... So I felt this is a great work. Planting trees in the memory of a daughter. And if it is people's sentiments, then why shouldn't we plant trees on the birth of a daughter? That very day this idea came to my mind and I thought it is really a job to be done saving a girl child is a must. Only a parent knows what a daughter means. And when she is lost for good he realizes... how painful it can be. It can only be understood by someone who has gone through this grief. Mom! Where are the washed socks? - Socks? Yes. They must be somewhere there. I put them to dry on the tank. Enough. Do you have any more? No. This is the last one. We used to fetch water from the well. Fill the pots and carry them home. We carried them in our heads. We also took small mugs along, used them to scoop the water and fill the bigger pot. This is how the pot was filled. And then we carried the water on our heads. This is how it was. No water was available then. Did you do it? Did you carry water too? Yes, I too did it. There were stairs in the well then, and wells had ample water. so they filled water from there. But I had to fill water from small ditches. We carried small pots and glasses. Then used it to fill the earthen pots and bring home. And we drank that water. The way you filled water from small ditches I never did that. So, after the watershed work started and the water conservation... We were taught to gradually stop the water. In my age we didn't face so much of water problem. We first built earthen water check dams. Earlier when I went to nursery I carried water bottle. I never gave it to anyone and hid it. Because other would drink it? If others knew it they would drink it. Gradually we built 600 to 700 check dams at the nursery. That conserved some water. It also lessened soil erosion. And then we built a concrete check damn downstream. It is completely filled, you must have seen. After the year 2010 we have no problems with the water. Sister Kala. Sister Kala! Is the factory closed? I need a job. Yes, the factory is closed. So now? It is being shifted to other place. I don't know when it will start again. When it opens, let me know. - Yes, I will let you know. You too want to work here? - Yes. Until my daughter is grown up I will come to work. Who will take care of her? -My mother-in-law - Will she? When the work starts... I don't have any idea when. Machines are just lying. Whenever the work starts I will give you a call or send a message, then you can come to work. All right. But make sure someone takes care of your daughter. Yes, my sister-in-law at home will take care of her. She and my mother-in-law will take care. All right then. When factory starts, I will call you. Okay, you can also call Kelash and I will come. When I joined this project, in the beginning, we planted bamboo, naseberry, pomegranate, and we started having termites problem. For this problem someone advised us, we should break small pieces of aloevera and put in there, it will repel termites. But we didn't put it in small pieces, but directly planted the saplings. Once a man came here to visit. He asked us, you grow so much aloevera what do you do with it? - We don't do anything with it. We only use its tender part to cook it as a vegetable. And nothing else. Then he said he had deployed machinery. He said you can make many things like juice, shampoo, pickles, why don't you make those things here? Then we won a Rivoli Fund of 25,000 rupees. And we bought some equipments. Now we have a machine costing 8,000 rupees. When we started producing, the demand went so high that we were unable to produce enough. But now our aloevera factory was shut down for one year. At that moment we had no place to relocate the plant. Now we have it and we'll start it again. What's the burning smell? Is it from my clothes? Be careful, it might melt and get stuck. It actually happened once. My clothes are dirty. - No, mine are dirtier. Take stuff from there. - I will. Our next aloevera group meeting is on... - On 10th. What date? - No, it's on 2nd of next month. Unless we meet after the work, it won't be done. So all of us should meet It will get work done. If we hold meetings and make decisions only then we will know what work we should do. About installing machines, and other things. Okay? We will hold meeting on 2nd. Don't be late. You were late last time. So I had to request other ladies to come. I wasn't late. It was because... You should have informed. I did try to call... - You should have informed. ...but aunt insisted that I take Asha along. So I had to return and bring her. Attending meeting is a must for everyone. - Yes it is. Of course barring some exigency. No, I will come with everyone now. I know machine is shut. Now you tell me. What can we do if it is shut? -Any suggestions? Bhuri, you tell them. The plant is closed and it's lying at the Health Center. We are bringing it to the training center which is ready now. So, erecting a shed there, will cost lot of money. So should we do it with the money we ladies have collected or get it done with public support. But we've to build a shed first. Like we have machines and filters... We do have all the machines but for lack of space they are lying dismantled. We have to fit aloevera machines and start extracting juice. Now as we have a large center ready, we should fit the machines and run it properly. It would provide jobs to many women. So, we wish to work in proper manner. That's the aim of this meeting, and if you agree let's move there, start working and arrange for the funds. As people come to know of it, the demand will come. But we aren't functional. So many customers are asking for our product. And money, we can always get a loan. Whatever money we have with us, we can use it. And if more money is needed, we can get a loan We can repay it once the factory starts - Yes. Winter is almost over, we can make pickles now. Pickles are made in summer. - They are in demand. Yes, demand is high. - Aloevera juice is good for diabetes. Actually it is a must for diabetes. We are paying Mr. Mehta 2,000 rupees to keep accounts. If we could save that amount it will be useful. - Yes. If we can do the job, money will remain with us. Someone must learn it. If we do our own work, we won't have any problem. We have to go only when supplies are over. We can always account for everything. Right now none of us knows what's our income and outgoing. As we are not self-sufficient. - No one has learned it. Indeed we don't know still. We do have a diary. If we come forward and do the job it can be done. If we keep passing the buck nothing can be done. We can start it today... We should not depend on others. If we come together, we can do it. Parasramji! - Yes? Brother! - Coming. Come here. Grandpa, come. What's it? - Just come with me. At that time, I remember, I was a small kid As from today... when this mining started here. People came on bikes. And they dig stones from the mine and took samples away. So, they showed us a dream. This will be done here, that will be done... At that time, the dreams which were shown to us, due to those promises, we did not oppose to this. Thus the mining started here. People started getting jobs. People started earning money. Roads started being laid. Everything happened. But it caused a great damage. A great loss, which can never be compensated. One could have earned money somewhere else. But such a village, such grand mountains, such nature, can never be brought back again. This loss can never be compensated ever. What is root verb here? It is 'Khadti'. Yes it is 'Khadti'. Why? Because this denotes singular person. Yes, because the word 'Sah' is first person singular. 'Maa Khadti' in Sanskrit would mean, I am eating. Read each sentence and answer. Who will say it in Hindi language? What's the meaning of 'Kutrah'? ? - It is 'next'. It means 'Where'. - What does it mean? -'Where'. Where does the scared mouse go? If I have to say... 'Where are you going?' Who'll tell me in Sanskrit. Niki wants to become a nurse when she grows up. Assisting patients. She likes this work. She does all the household work well too. Education is must for girls. Because nowadays... it's not that education is just to get a job. But studies are important because she will be able to understand things and have the ability to do anything. She should be confident to do anything. Why are you laughing? I could not study, but my girls will. Like I don't understand when you talk about some things. But the kids are taught many things in English. Like vegetables But I can't understand. So the kids should understand and learn. And they shouldn't face problems in further. Here is Rekha Bai's saving. It is 40 rupees. Rekha, pass it on. Pass it to your right. This Rekha's saving. Here is Rekha's saving. Rekha's saving. - Deposited with Kala. Her saving is deposited. You've anyone's money to deposit? Here's Kala's saving. I pass it on to Hagami Bai. - Kala's money is deposited. Here is Kala's deposit. Kala's money deposited. - Her money deposited. Here is Hagami Bai saving. Here is her saving. Hagami's saving deposited. Heera Bai's saving deposited. - Her money is deposited. When women had no work, they faced many problems. When we remained at home, if a child needed to go to the hospital or anything, we had to ask money from our husband for whatever we needed or to go out. So he would get upset, saying he has no money and he can't give it. Though drinking is not allowed men drank and beat up their wives. Now ladies have become smarter. If a man says something, women can reply. Mantaining their say in matters. Women have their own money now. They can come and go as they wish. Should I lift the pan? - No. Hey, come here. Sit in the water. - We will bathe leisurely. Naru sister. Hey, sister Naru. - What? Oh, welcome. What are you doing? - Milking the cow. Hello, how are you? - I'm fine. I'm here to tell you that this monday we are restarting the factory. - Oh, good. So all of you have to come from Monday on, ok? It is restarting, so everyone should get back to work. Whom should I inform? - Sister Nanu, Devu and Bhuri. What time? - At nine o'clock sharp. All right. - Okay? - Yes. Fine then. We are glad factory has started. Keep working. Wash it thoroughly. - Yes. Wash and peel it properly. See that no dirt remains. Let's finish it fast. It is nearing lunch time. Hold the pipe like this. I was late today. Due to household work? - Yes. My daughter finished most of the work at home. Whatever chores remains I will go back home and do it. But I had to finish the chores so I was late. My daughters do it for me. Only wash the cut pieces. Bhuri, you must come every day. - Yes, I will. The machines were shut for long. - Yes. We'll bring the materials now. Yes, supplies are must. Ask Mr. Raja to get the supplies. Or the work will stop. Use clean water and wash it thoroughly. We have to make powder from it. - Yes. Of course we make powder too. Take some powder with warm water. It helps reduce weight. Really? - Yes, it does. Then I should start taking it. - Yes. We should. - Yes. When weight is reduced you stop. - Right. When was machine shifted here? - Some time ago. Hey, pour some water here. My aunt keeps calling from Udaipur asking for the aloevera juice. Tell her, now she will get it soon. Do we spare knife? - No. They will finish the job here. Only a few pieces are left. What's wrong? I didn't know this is also to be put in the machine. Okay, bring some more. Hold on. Do it easy. Do I remove it? - Yes... Why do women act and think like this? In our times we faced problems but somehow we endured. But nowadays girls won't bear it. Is it done? Bring another batch. Man's life is simple but women's life is more difficult. Shut that machine now, its job is over. We have to keep everyone happy, We have to do our job as well as other people's. Have to raise children... ...have to work for everyone, and have to keep everyone happy. B, H, U. - No, first... What it is? - B, H, U. B... H? U. - Yes, U. M, I... - M, I. K, A. - K, A. P. - P. Double 'O'. - Double 'O'. J, A. - JA. H, E. - H E. M, A. - M A. N, T. - N T. Are you writing it again? I write first? Shall I start from here? - Yes. B, H. - BH. A. - A. W, A. - WA. R, I. - RI. All of you move a little to this side. Just a little, not much. Better sit in pairs. She was reluctant to come for the exam.
