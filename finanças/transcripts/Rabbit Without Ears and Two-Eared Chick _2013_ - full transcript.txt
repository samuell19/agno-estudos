Beautiful, cuddly, soft fur? Cuddly fur. Exactly! There are no ears. That's why I don't hunt you. Well, maybe I don't have big ears… but I can do everything, that a real rabbit can do. And what is that? I can run quickly from here to there… - And from there to here. - Anyone can. I can also dig quite deep holes. - Cuckoo! - Hey, watch out! And… what else can you do?

I want to play hide and seek! How does it work? I look away and count. And you just go behind some bushes or some tree. Great, I'll tell you right away - where am I hiding. - No, I must not know, otherwise it would be "Find" and not "Hide". - That's right again. - Ok, let's go! - 1, 2… - Hm, what hiding place do I use? 3! 4! 5! 6! 7, 8. 9, 10! I'm coming! There you are! Found you! Oh no, did my leg stick out? Or my tail? - Did I do something wrong? - No, nonsense. It is the tree. Would you like to play something else? No, no! I'll do it right this time. Yes, you'll see… I mean, don't see. Well, good. - 1, 2… - Cool, yes! Yippee! 3, 4, 5… 6, 7, 8… Are you ready? 9… I'm turning around! 9 and 1/2… Uh, 9 and 3/4 Damn, you should stay at home. Watch out, I'm coming! You are driving my customers away!

Traveling alone? No, but I'm looking for a hiding place. A hiding place? Sure, I'll show you the best hiding place in the world. Your friend will never ﬁnd you there! Oh, that's nice of you. Don't you want to take your cell phone with you? - Where are you? - Oh, I'll ﬁnd it. It's the, uh, self-running frog cell, you know. Hello! Chick! You're really well hidden! Super! Great! Chick! Oh! You live here? Cool! Why do you have such a big pot? So I can, uh, hide you better. You're safe in there from your weird friend. My friend is not weird. Yeah, yeah, sure. Don't get excited. Here I have something for your, uh, camouﬂage. Very pretty. You look beautiful. - What? - Leave the camouflage on! And off into the pot! This will make a delicious broth. - What? - Uh, it's nothing at all! Oh, I almost forgot the garlic. I need it so that you taste really good, I mean, so you're hidden. What? Chick! Chick! Where can she be? Oh, what if something happened to her? Oh, no. I can't do this right now. - Are you playing too? - Shh, not so loud. Yes, this is also part of the game. Yes, please? Hello, Fox. Can it be that you have a yellow chick? Such a fluffy one with ears? With ears? Since when do chicks have ears? It doesn't matter! I'm looking for one with ears. Tell me where it is, and I will never ask you to chase me again. - Huh! For real? - Yeah, really. You're just saying that so I'll let the chick go. Ha, so you got it! There, it's running! Tricked you! Hey, Foxy! What's going on? Nothing, I just… we waited like crazy for you and you never found us! I guess you'd rather hang out with the loser here. Hey, I'm not a loser. You! Shut your mouth! This is a matter between the fox and the cool rabbits. Capiche, no-ears, or don't you understand French? - I was just asking the fox something. - People! Take a hike, or draw straws, but work it out between yourselves. Sorry, sorry, but I was just cooking a small modest soup, - and it is waiting for me. - Hello, Hello! Man, hiding is so boring. There you are! You smell so funny, like thyme and a touch of rosemary. Isn't that from the Great Forest Roast Cookbook? Yes? Well, come on, I think, We'd better go. The camouflage tastes very good, by the way. Did someone in particular want to cook chicken soup? Oh, what, no, that was just a… very simple vegetable soup for detoxifying. Anyone want some? Clearly you are trying again, to shove poor, innocent rabbits into the pot. We may have only marble sized brains, but we're not stupid! So long! Oh, I was so close. No, Papa, not you again… - I'll help you clean up. - Uh, don't. Just sit down here, okay? Watch a bit of television. There are always some interesting shows on at this time. They hatch out of an egg. Weak and clumsy. Wings, feathers still undeveloped. So at first they are completely dependent. But with every day they grow stronger, to leave the protective nest. And at the same time also develops… their innate talent… - to ﬂy! - Oh, it's that time again! Joke For Wit! Today: Who tells… - the funniest vegetable joke? - Come here! This is my favorite show. It's really funny. Hi! There's two snowmen, one says to the other… "Can you smell carrots well?" Snowmen! They have a carrot for a nose! - Funny! - Joke For Wit! I can't believe it. The only thing missing was the garlic, then suddenly it was gone. If you can't do it like that, then build a decent trap. That works for everyone, even for hunter failures! Hm, trap? Sounds like a super good plan, but how do I lure it there? Now I know how to do it. So… perfect! And now the honey pops. So… one more here and here and… Oh! Mmm! Honey pops! Mmm! No! Stop! No! The one with the crispy coat! Oh, I love them! What is this now? Ow! That such a few small honey pops could knock you out, old man. Good idea, a little nap can't hurt. Cozy! Here is the mailbox. Speak after the… Better. Hey good morning. Did you sleep well? So, the breakfast is ready. Look, I have a beautiful breakfast carrot for you. No, you can't do that, chick. That's a breakfast carrot, you munch on it like a regular carrot. I'm not stupid, I know that's a dumb carrot. But I'm not a rabbit. You always want to do rabbit things with me. That's why you can do everything better. Running, digging, hiding… Well, rabbits can just do those things. It's probably innate. And what is innate to me? I don't like doing rabbit things anymore. - Chick… - Besides, I do not like carrots. She doesn't like carrots? That can't be true. She doesn't like carrots? Perhaps the little caterpillar, knows what chicks eat. Caterpillar? Caterpillar! Now Caterpillar is gone too. Hello? Are you there? Chick? I brought you something new to eat that hopefully you will like. Thanks, but I'm not hungry. Do you think I'm good at something too? Or, at least, somewhat good? Yes! But what would you do? Yeah, I don't know. A chick thing maybe. Um, well. A chick thing… I know! - We'll simply ask the experts. - Yes, we'll ask the experts! What is that? Well, if you don't know something yourself you have to ask someone. And the one who knows, that is the expert, and we are lucky because the experts live just around the corner. Cool! Oh yeah! We'll ask! Come on! Hello. - We have a question. - What do they want? And what would that be? So, my friend and I, we wanted to ask… what chicks are actually good at. Uh… We peck and scratch. Yes! We peck and scratch for worms. - We can do that well. - Yes, hm-hm. Do you see? Pecking and scratching, that's what chicks do. Well then! Thank you! And what about flying? - Fly? - Yes. Why do we have wings? I do not know. Looks good... - But I would like so much to… - …fly? She wants to ﬂy! Yes, then stick a jet up your tail. Or a propeller on your head. Chicks can not fly! Hey, let's go, we won't let them bring us down. Do I have to do rabbit things again now? No! You're a chick! But chicks can't ﬂy. And I wanted to fly so much. Hey, they do not have a clue! None of them have an opinion of their own! I'll help you ﬁgure out how to fly, - and then it will happen. - Really? - Sure. - Yes! You're the greatest friend in the world. Oh, not at all. Come on, let's get started. It is always scares me, when people think so differently. - Just what are they going to do? - Do you think we should do something? I would say we must! Let's see what we have. Here, take it. - Ok. - Careful! Oh! I Have you! Oops! - No problem! - Where is it? My Friend, The Rabbit; My Friend, The Fox. My Friend, The Tree. Well, at least the tree is true. Ah, here: My Friend, The Bird. Here it is explained in detail. - So, ﬁrst you need wings. - Which I have. There are large and small ones. Visiting at this time? I'm coming! Yes, yes, I'm already here. Hello? Ouch! Right on the rump. Do you see? Chicks can not fly. We just wanted to say it again. Well my chick can! I hope… Hm? Who was that? Oh, just the neighbors. They wanted to know something from the stupid internet. Oh, right. So, let's have a look… Can chicks fly? But now I'm curious. Chickens can not fly. Can chicks fly that have ears? Enter! Chicks with ears do not exist. What? What! Of course they do. Stupid cow! And they can fly! They can not. And besides, I'm not a stupid cow. - Yes, they can! - Rude! - No! - But! - No! No! No! - But! But! But! But! No! - Enable collective print. - Huh? Why print? What are you doing? Nothing at all! Can't I participate in anything? Read the beautiful book. No, don't come in, stop! Can we start flying? - Not now! - That's all right! Then when? Oops! Oh, there's a chick on it. But a part is missing. Yes, I just figured out, um, that… - What? - There. Better see for yourself. Oh, a sun! Yippee! The chick in the picture can fly. Then I can certainly do that too. Yay! I"ll hang that right away over my bed! Hey, why are you staying? Come on, hurry! Yes, of course. Oh, I'm so happy! What do I do now? Look, here, you see! I can fly! Yippee! I can ﬂy! I can ﬂy! Um, yes, hm, very nice. - 8 o'clock, ok? - Ok. - Good night, favorite bunny. - Good night. I made breakfast for you. And I now I know how to fly. I have you the best training program the world. We need to train your legs… because you will need strong legs to take off. And your wings will have to flap properly. Hm, there was something else… Oh! After breakfast we have to get the right equipment. Oh yes, oh yes! Finished! Let's fly, please! Come on, let's go. Yes! Oh yes! Oh yes! First you need this cap. This is an aviation cap. Here! This is totally important. It's crazy, everything you know about. A bit tight on the ears though. That's super, then it won't come down while flying. So, next, you need, of course, a coach. Where do we get that from? - He's standing in front of you. - You? - Exactly. - Oh. - Are you ready? - Ready! 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2 Ist point: perseverance training. And off! Watch out! You jump down and land on the pillow! Jump! Um, jump! Check! Ready, go! Bravo. Check! Yoohoo, that's fun! Chicks can not fly! And that's that! Checked! Stupid people. As the cord moves the bells rings. Hey, how is it up there? - Are you afraid of heights? - No, everything is super! Hello! is it right that you are getting smaller and smaller? I'm almost not sick at all. I must admit that I might need a break. Wow, the trap, the trap! I caught something! I caught something! Everything checked out. Now it should work. Ok. From the top of the hill it's a breeze. Nothing can go wrong here! Our fan club is already here. Well? What are we going to see no-ears? My friend here is going to fly today. Chicks can not fly. This is scientiﬁcally proven. - From a chick scientist. - You curious about it, Foxy? Fly to me, you juicy yellow lunch. Come on, let's show them now. Perfect ﬂying weather. Just think about everything I have shown you. Footwork, Wing Technology, Lifting Off… and do not forget to breathe. In out, in, out… Ready? And now… you will experience… you will experience… something! Attention… Ready… Departure! That's good! Super swing! Great beak attitude! And now take off! Jump! Jump! Jump! You can do it! You're about to take off! Out of the way! Out of the way! Oh no! Hey, don't be sad. Your footwork was great. I want to go home. Come on. We have always said that it is not possible. - Chicks can not fly. - Yes, but it would have been nice. - After least they tried. - It almost worked. - Such a pity. - The helmet was much too heavy. - We do not have flying ears. - Otherwise we would be flying rabbits. Wait. Here. What have we done wrong? We walked, jumped and whirled. We have done everything it takes to learn how to fly. - I just don't understand. - Oh no! She didn't fly a bit. Not a tiny little bit. Not one bit. Hello, is that you? Is that you, Chick? Oh no! Damn! Chick? Chick! Chick! - No. - No. - No. - No. No, she was not here. - No. - No. - No. - No. No, I'm sorry, mate. You didn't tell me the truth. Chicks can not fly at all. But you're different than the other chicks. Maybe the others are right. I can not fly and you're not a real rabbit. But I am a real rabbit, even though I don't have ears. And since you're my friend, I don't give a damn what the others say. And you know what? I don't give a damn what others say either. If you really want something, it can come true. I really wished I could find a friend once. And then one day there was a knock… and you were standing outside the door. So, you in your egg. Simply like that. You mean that one day there will be a knock and then I can fly, just like that? Oh, no, Chick, I did not mean it like that. One can not know beforehand how a wish will come true. You know, in my garden lived a small caterpillar. Her name was Raupi. She was very sweet and always ate my carrots. She loved it as much as I did. She even crawled onto my paw once. But then one day she was suddenly gone. And then, when I went into the garden the other day, I saw something. A little cocoon. And there she was, the sweet caterpillar. And when she slipped out of there, suddenly she had wings and she could… she could fly! - Fly? - Yes, I tell you! But now we need to dry you at home, otherwise you'll get a cold. You're all wet. Funny, it didn't work on me. Is that because you have something I don't have? What do you mean? Looks at this. - What is happening to me? - Nothing. And now with you? I'm hovering. Indeed! Do you know what I believe? If you can hover, you can ﬂy. Oh, come on! We'll try that out! Very dark. Well, we'd better wait until tomorrow. Otherwise you'll get lost. Wow! I am very excited! Yoohoo! Yippee! Ah, not on the chair! I was very close, I swear! There were only a few technical problems. Blablablablabla. It's always the same with you. What does that mean? She was really good at it, knocked me over. I'm lucky I'm still alive! Hey buddy. I saw that your light was still on, I thought that we both might together... Hello! What's the matter? I caught the bear! I caught the bear! What have you caught? A bear? I can not believe it! Papa! Papa? Stay here! I give up. Now he's ﬁnally crazy. I can send you a photo! Wind from north to northeast, the scent of fresh spring air, and… a lift from below… super flying weather! Do you think it will really work? Yeah, of course. Are you ready? Should I let go? Yes! Yoohoo, it works! - I love you. - I love you too. Look, I told you! I'm flying! Are we the experts now? Exactly, experts on aviation, friendship and ears! I'm coming!
