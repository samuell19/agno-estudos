Rick Todd! Yes, sir, Mr. Kelly. Mr. trim is here for a demonstration. You ready? Right away, sir, soon as Eugene turns on the smoke machine. Hey, eugie! Get up. The boss and trim are here. Get up! Wait. I'm on the third murder. The bat lady's going to blow one of the rat man's heads off. If I end up reading want ads, one of your heads will blow off. Get going! Ok, ok. Oh, bat lady! My bat lady! Rick! Aah! Rick! Rick! What's holding you up, Todd? Starting right away, Mr. Kelly. Get going. Kelly wants to see it work. Tell him to come in here! Eugie! Rick! Rick! Ooh! Rick! Eugie boy, you all right? You need air. [Coughs] What's the matter, Kelly? She having trouble with her lungs? I'll handle the smoke, and you attach the tube. Come on. Ok... Let her go. Ok! My bat lady! She's not smoking, she's spitting. Hey, what's going on here? Not a thing, officer. We're just demonstrating a new sign. Mr. Kelly, watch it! Uh, ohh... Hey, Rick, I'm all set... Rick? Rick! Ricky-Ricky! Ricky-Ricky. Yo, Rick! What? Oh. I'm all set to make your dinner. How would you like your beans? Preferably out of the can. No. I mean, how would you like your beans done? Why don't you stuff them? No. Broil them, medium rare, a little mushroom sauce over them. Beans! Know why all we got to eat is beans? Huh? Every time I find a job, you lose it. Bat lady! You and your crummy comic books, that's all you ever think about! Sometimes I think about girls, too. I think about girls. That's about all... Just think about them. Can I afford to take them out? No. Because of you, I'm going to be an old maid. Remember why we left steubendale for New York? You promised to marry Ophelia Jackson, and her father found out... That wasn't the only reason. Oh, it was that other girl... mabeline Smithers. Her brother thought... We came to New York so I could study art, so I could become a famous painter, so I could be hung in art galleries, museums. You almost got hung in steubendale. Forget steubendale. Try and remember why you came to New York. Uh... I, uh... Why did I come to New York? Hmm-hmm-hmm... No... wait a minute. Oh, yeah. That's right. You were going to be a writer and write children's books about Freddie the field mouse, goosey the goose, right? What have you done? Nothing, except read comic books. You also lose our jobs on account of comic books. You keep me awake with your bad dreams on account of comic books. Know what I've decided to do, pal? Be pals with me? Yeah, we'll be pallies. I'll write you at least once every month. And I'll answer you. Good. Now go get supper. [Clatter] Write to me? Look, junior, a divorce is the only way out. We've been together too long. Ever since we were tenderfeet in the kangaroo patrol. You can have the whole apartment. Full custody of the beans and the bat lady. Ok?

[Pop] [Makes pouring sounds] I hope the bubbles didn't tickle your nosy. No, just my nosetril. Your nosetril? Yes, just a little tickle. Think you have enough if I want a little slug? Sure, Rick. I have everything when I'm pretending. See, I'm just making believe that we're both very rich, wealthy millionaires... With money... And you're a very, very famous artist, and I'm a very famous writer, see, and I'm just making believe that we're not even eating beans, just a big juicy steak. Would you like a piece? No, no. I'm up to here. I think I had too much vichyssoise. That's the idea. You have to pretend, 'cause when you pretend, your dreams come true. It's just like wishing. Watch. Damp. Oh, ho ho, damp.

Out of the wild blue yellow yonder, with tail full of jet propulsion, comes Vincent, Vincent the vulture. Vincent the vulture... Defender of truth and liberty and member of the audubon society. He is half boy, half man, half bird, with feathers growing out of every pore. He is flying to his interplanetary space station, trying to escape zuba, zuba the magnificent. But Vincent is very aware that behind those inviting red lips, behind those purple boudoir eyes, and behind that cleaving cleavage lies a diabolical soul. Zuba is trying to get away from Vincent. His secret power formula... X34 minus 5r1 plus 6-x36. Waah! Vincent is hit. He is hit. Zuba fires her death-dealing, atomic atomizing pivot gun. [Makes shooting noises] Boom! Shaboom! The Gore is oozing out of his tail. Will Vincent the vulture ever live to fly back to his homogenized space station high above the milky way? Whoom! Shoom! Voovah! Waah! And out in space, Vincent pulls her close, but zuba fights against the embrace of Vincent the vulture. She's allergic to his feathers. Her teeth snarl, gleaming white. He tears her clothes and exposes her two big round shoulders. Vincent closes in on her. Waah! Waah! Eugene. [Knock knock] Eugene! Get me a lawyer. [Knock knock] Oh. Coming! You'd better. [Knock knock] Oh! Oh, it's you, Mrs. milldoon. It ain't Gina lollobrigida. Listen, Eugene, you've been flapping your gums in your sleep again, and my new tenant in 4a is complaining. I'm awfully sorry, Mrs. milldoon. I'll apologize to him. He is a her. She's a successful artist, and you stay away from 4a. I don't want her thinking she's moved into skid row. Hmm. You mean, she's an artist who makes money? Paid her rent in advance. Remember... any more noise, and you'll be using the curb for a pillow. Oh, all right, Mrs. milldoon, I'll watch it. From now on, I'll sleep with band-aids over my mouth. Band-aids... On my mouth. Successful artist. Hmm. Maybe if she saw some of Rick's paintings... [Knock on door] There's someone at the door, Abby. Huh? There's someone at the door. What goes on at this place? First the banshee downstairs, and now something else. How'd you talk me into moving here? Because it's greenwich village, and it's romantic. Besides, my horoscope said this is where I'd meet my true love. Hold it. Finish this pose. Grrr! What'll I say now? Uh, good evening. My name is Eugene fullstack, and I hear you're a very successful artist. I thought you could meet my friend Rick Todd, who I believe is one of the better painters, and if you would talk to him, you might cheer him up. He's getting very discouraged just hanging around. So am I. Good evening. My name is Eugene fullstack, and I thought... whoa! Whoa! Rick! Rick! Whoa! Rick! Rick! Rick! Rick, I just saw the bat lady upstairs! Honest, I saw her on the fourth floor. Rick, I'm trying to tell you something. Aah! Help! Help! No, lady, don't yell. It's a mistake. Don't yell. No, lady, please. No yelling, lady. I'm sorry, lady. Help! Oh! Help, police! The bat lady... the fat lady! Rick! Rick! Rick! Rick! Rick, I saw the bat lady upstairs. What? I saw the bat lady. Sure. She made a three-point landing on the roof. Really, she's upstairs on the fourth floor. Will you go back to sleep? The bat lady scared me, and I ran into the fat lady. Bat lady... fat lady... Are you crazy? No. This really happened. Upstairs is the bat lady. She scared me, so I ran downstairs to the fat lady. She scared me worse. Eugie. The bat lady scared me. The fat lady was downstairs. I ran downstairs to tell you about the bat lady. You're having one of your bad dreams. She's got things sticking out of her head. She's a crazy-looking person. You got things sticking in your head. Come on. No, no! They're out there! There's someone out there. Open the door. There's no one out there. I'm scared, Ricky. I thought you loved the bat lady. But I'm scared of the fat lady. There's no fat lady or bat lady. Open the door so we can go to bed. Oh! I told you she was out there. The bat lady? No, the fat lady. There's no one out there. [Splat] She's out there. The bat lady? The fat lady. Abby. Abby, look. According to my chart, it's happened. Tonight my moon is full and square to Jupiter, uranus is square to sagittarius, Mars is square to Venus... I saw him for the first time tonight. He's the one, my true love. Oh, bessie, no! That square's your true love? You tear up that horoscope. The stars don't lie. But isn't it awful about our children? Your children? Shouldn't you be introduced first? Well, suppose they look like him? Rent them out for Halloween. He's not very handsome. But he is kind of cute. You know, the safe kind. The safe kind? What's safe in pants? The not-so-handsome kind make the best husbands. Other women don't want them. The man another woman doesn't want doesn't exist. Now, lights out, girl. I've got an early appointment with my publisher in the morning. Suffering catfish! You're supposed to be an artist and a writer of children's stories. Well, you're not an artist, and you're not a writer, not by my wife's standards. I knew I'd make the grade. 62 pages of drawings and no blood? Not even an itsy-bitsy nosebleed? What, suffering catfish, do you call this, a murdock book for kiddies with no stranglings, with no decapitations? Where are they? I must have lost my head because this is where I get off. Wait, Abigail, please sit down. Let me explain something to you. I'm a little bit on the edgy-wedgy. My wife's been giving me the knife. If sales don't pick up, she'll give me the ax. You wouldn't want old murdie boy out of a job, would you? Hmm? I'm not cupid, Mr. murdock. If you can't wear the pants in your family... The pants? Eeee! The pants! Since Edith and I are separated, it's a wonder I've got my striped shorts. Look at the competition we're getting in television. Abigail, night before last, I counted 13 murders, 4 stabbings, 9 suffocations, and 6 poisonings on two channels in one hour! And another thing... Just you think of this, girl. When they're able to show that red blood gushing out of open wounds in spectacular color... Ohh! And they'll get it free, right into their living rooms, free, right into the living rooms, sponsored by those... Friendly used car dealers. Sorry, Mr. murdock. Get yourself another artist, someone who can bleed to suit your wife. Let's talk this over. Come on, please, Abigail, don't leave me. Miss, I'm Rick Todd, and this is Eugene fullstack. The landlady said we'd find Abigail Parker here. She's busy now in surgery. Good. We'll wait. Sit down. If she doesn't back up your statement, we're back on the asphalt, unless you can prove you weren't trying to make time with the fat lady. Who's got that kind of time? I'm still excited about seeing the bat lady. You like the bat lady? Oh, yeah, and I just found out she's for real. Oh, sure, she is. She's a living doll. Do you... Do you know her? Intimately. In fact, she's even more darling in person. No fooling. Boy, those lovely lips, those red, inviting, luscious lips, like two strips of liver gleaming in the moonlight. What's wrong with your mouth? Is it sore? No. I thought I felt a pucker coming on. Oh. And her eyes, those magnificent eyes. What's wrong with yours? You got astigmatism? No. I was just uncrossing them. They really pay money for this kind of drawing? What's the matter with Abigail's drawings? Oh, bad, very bad. Look, the legs, they look like arms. You should see the bat lady's legs. Oh, miss? Yes? Your seam's crooked. [Intercom buzzes] Thanks, heaps. Yes, Mr. murdock? Bessie, I need an artist. Get me the names of the best artists that we have on file. Yes, sir. I'll bring you the folder. Did you hear what he said? He needs an artist. When bessie comes out, kiss her. Who wants to kiss her? You do. I got to get into that folder. I got a blister on my lip. If you can pretend beans are steaks, you can pretend she's the bat lady. She might fight you, but you're doing this for your kangaroo patrol pal. Pouches forever. Ok, kiss, kiss. Remember, kiss, kiss. Will you watch my switchboard, please? I won't only watch your switchboard, I'll buzz your lights and tangle your plugs. Come here, baby. Not with your friend watching. Oh, he's gone. Ah, what are we waiting for? My sagittarius is rising. Hang on, boy. No, you're supposed to fight me. Uh... Easy, gal, he just got some new bearings. Here, you dropped this. The stars were right. My Jupiter is jumping. I think we're getting somewhere now. I think my blister is getting a blister. It's smart business to get in good with the boss' secretary. Go into business for yourself. Put more men on the job. Here she comes... kiss her again! What do you think you're doing? I'm awfully sorry, ma'am. I thought you were someone else. He told me to kiss you. You told him! I wouldn't have sent a boy to do a man's job. That's for the man. The job's filled. Look what you've done. Oh, the bat lady. Are you miss Abigail Parker, miss Parker? Are you miss Parker, miss Parker? I'm Eugene fullstack. You should lay off protein. No, that's my name. I'm sorry he kissed you, and he's sorry he kissed you, aren't you? No, I liked that. Stay here and see if you can sell murdock one of your stories. Maybe one of us might get a job. Hold it, miss Parker. My partner said he went to your door and saw a real bat lady. My model was posing. Now, may I go? What's the rush? I never met a lady cartoonist before. All lady cartoonists are extremely grateful. I'm an artist myself. Why don't we get together and compare mad scientists, hmm? Sure love the way you draw the bat lady... Lovely lines. I like the way your bone structure is, um... Structured. Dandy tibialis gastrocnemiuses, also. Going up? Yes, down. Try sideways, then once around the park. Parker will do better, dear. She's going to do substantially better. That's what I said. So don't fret your ever-loving fretter. I said yes! The sales of the next issue will show a substantial increase. Yes... Throw in a couple of uh-huhs once in a while, will you? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. [Giggles] Great scot! Wh-wh-what are you supposed to be? I'm supposed to be Eugene fullstack. No, I am Eugene fullstack. Are you Mr. murdock? Come on, speak up! Speak, speak, speak! What's on your mind? Spit it out, boy! Spit it out! Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. I write little stories for children... Children's stories, see? Oh, you're a write... a writer. Oh! You have that thin, emaciated, anemic look... Bloodless look... Probably very much in need of a publisher for a great new comic book. Why didn't you say so? Wipe that helpless look off your face. Come up to me and say, "Mr. murdock, I've got a great new idea "for a new comic book. Are you interested?" Come on. Mr. murdock... I've got a new... Great idea... For a new... Comic book! Are you... Interested? Um... No. No. Oh. Wait, wait. Maybe an idea growing out of the brain that probably lies behind that face may be what my wife's separate maintenance needs. Ahem. Lad, what's the idea? Give me the gist of it. Give me the idea. I write about all my little friends... Little goosey goose and little Freddie field mouse who live in a little corn field. Now, these little friends of mine... Little goosey goose and little Freddie field mouse? Uh-huh. See that little window back there, boy? Yes, sir. Open it a little... Then jump. All right. No, no! I'd like to see Mr. murdock. Madam, at your service. Then you are responsible for my son Richard. Oh, how do you do, Mrs. murdock? Nice to know you. I'm not Mrs. murdock. I'm Mrs. John stilton. Oh. Ooh! As publisher of the bat lady, you are responsible for my son's condition. And as I'm chairman of the second elementary school district, I'm going to file a petition against your comic book. Before I do, however, I think you ought to have the pleasure of my son Richard's company while I go shopping to observe for yourself the effects your horror literature has on undeveloped minds! But, madam, as a mother, aren't you a little worried about leaving your undeveloped mind here? Your mother is the one to be worried. Well, uh, Richard, uh... Pleased to make your acquaintance. Pleased to offer you my hand. Aah! Ow! Ow, ow, ow! What happened? What's the matter? Bessie, what floor is the nurse on? The second, below Dr. Stevens' office. Thank you. [Mumbles] Who's that? This is Richard stilton. His mother left him here for developing. Don't get too close. He may be poisonous. Why, he's cute. Well, Richard, what can I do to entertain you? Not a thing. You're too old for me, mophead. Is this a dagger? No, it's a letter opener. It's too sharp to play with. Who wants to play with it? W-w-w-w-wait! Richard! That's no way to behave. The bat lady wouldn't like that. Who cares about the bat lady? She's too tame. She stinks. No blood. I like blood. [Door slams] You touch me, and I'll throw this jug of acid in your eyes. I'll mobilize you! Eugene! No! I got it! Look, niagara falls. Why don't you two go on a honeymoon? I'll bring the barrel! Ha ha ha! Hurry outside! Yeah. Thank you for the escort. It's been dandy having somebody breathe down my neck for two hours. It's a dandy neck. I wouldn't mind going on overtime. Same old line, Ricky? Shh. Man at work. Look, you're an unemployed artist, and I'm an unemployed artist. How about we get together and rattle our palettes around? Watch out, girl, he really rattles. Aren't you late for something? Looks like it. A friend of yours? She is now. Look, I'm sorry you're unemployed, but it happens that I'm not. I'm doing an advertising layout. So if you'll excuse me, I'll get my models and get to work. Models? Yes, models. You understand... They're people who pose. I need one male and one female. You can't beat that combination. How about me for the male? I posed once. Remember that poster, "send this boy to camp?" It was me. Maybe you would do. Have you ever posed with a girl? Not while anyone was watching. No, no, no. Hold her tighter. Be passionate. You love her. Take it easy. My back's killing me. You heard the boss. She said tighter. Ugh! I said tighter, but I didn't say fracture her rib case. Come on, I'll show him. Now, put your arms around me. That's it. Now, bend me back a little. That's fine. Now look into my eyes. Come closer. Now pretend you love my cleave-to lipstick. Pretend? You sound like my roommate, but you don't look like him. That was uncalled for. I could have sworn I heard you call. I believe you should be sent back to camp. That will be all today, Janet. We'll... Continue tomorrow when I can get you a professional model to work with. Ok, miss Parker. Bye, now. Bye. Let's see, you worked two hours. That should do it. No. That one was on the house. It's only a sample to show what you don't have to be missing. Your humility intrigues me. Miss Parker, aren't you breathing a little heavy for just a kiss? You're not in condition, are you? What's the matter, all work and no playing around? Mr. Todd, I'm breathing heavily because I happen to be a perfectly normal young woman. My heart beats, my pulse pounds, my blood count is high. I have all the biological impulses that anybody else has. I'm no different than you. I wouldn't say that. I liked being kissed. I love it... Under the mistletoe, in the dark, early in the morning, lunchtime, teatime, cocktail time, anytime, but I don't want to be kissed by you. Hold it. Give me a chance... At least with the cocktails and mistletoe bit. I might grow on you.

You're to blame, all that bat lady stuff. That's all over now. You know, I think I could help Eugene. Is he free to go to a meeting tonight about comic books? Go up and ask him. He's taking a bath, but walk right in. He's got his clothes on. You know, you still look familiar. And you still act familiar. Ooh, I'll see you later. Ah, there, Todd? Yes, sir. Sit down. I've already ordered for you. Thank you, Mr. furdock... Murdock. This is, uh, this is my daughter. Now let's get right down to business, lad. What... what are your ideas? Ideas? Yes. You mean stories? You want someone to write them? I need crime, I need passion, and even romance, providing it's between your repulsive characters. You want something gory... Like, uh, like the vulture. Vulture, vulture. Sounds fresh. I don't think there's any character like that in comic books. You mean, you've never heard of the vulture? Well, how could I? You just told me. When did you dream this up? I didn't dream this up. I didn't know he dreamed original dreams. Stop babbling, boy. Who dreams? What dreams? Tell me about the vulture, and give me that Gore pouring out. Oozing out, Mr. murdock! Oozing out of his tail! Eeee! Don't pay any attention to them. Oozing out of whose tail? Vincent... Vincent the vulture. Oh, Vincent the vulture. I see. What happens next? Tell me. I can't tell you now. Well, why not? I got to go home and have him sleep on it... I got to go home and sleep on it. Eugene, you dream boy, you. [Applause] The better America forum is on the air! You nervous, Eugene? No. No, just my knees are nervous. They've never been on television before. Tonight, the better America forum brings to your attention the monumental problem confronting your children today... The ever-growing threat and menace of the cheap pulps found on all newsstands masquerading under the titles of comic books. Now, to aid us in our discussion, we have enlisted the aid of Professor Samuel d. Roberts, child psychologist Mrs. Newton geudel, miss Abigail Parker. Miss Parker, artist and writer, was until recently herself a contributor to comic books. She knows the pressures brought by unscrupulous publishers. We're fortunate also in having miss Parker's guest... Mr. Eugene fullstack. [Applause] Mr. fullstack, I understand, has been reading comic books for 15 years. He's come at miss Parker's request to give his firsthand knowledge of what can happen to the human brain on a steady diet of comic books. ♪ Boo-dle-oo ♪ ♪ boo-dle-oo ♪ ♪ boy, have I got news for you ♪ ♪ I got a feeling, hap-happy feeling ♪ ♪ this is my lucky day ♪ ♪ don't want to sing the blues no more ♪ ♪ not when I feel this way ♪ ♪ I'm gonna rock it 'cause in my pocket ♪ ♪ I got a load of green ♪ ♪ I want to spread the word around ♪ ♪ so you'll know what I mean ♪ ♪ boo-dle-oo ♪ ♪ boo-dle-oo ♪ ♪ boy, have I got news for you ♪ ♪ I'm going to march, march, march along ♪ ♪ the Avenue ♪ ♪ I'm gonna sing, sing, sing my lucky song ♪ ♪ I'm goin' to fly, fly, fly ♪ ♪ like little birdies do ♪ ♪ spread your wings ♪ ♪ and come along ♪ ♪ I'm going to live, live, live it up along the way ♪ ♪ so tell me ♪ ♪ how can things go wrong ♪ ♪ hey, brother, what a heyday ♪ ♪ this has been my lucky payday ♪ ♪ and my lucky song ♪ ♪ boo-dle-oo ♪ ♪ boo-dle-oo ♪ ♪ boy, have I got news for you ♪ ♪ boo boo ba da wa ♪ ♪ boo boo ba da wa ♪ ♪ doo doo doo doo da wa ♪ ♪ ba zu ba zu ba zu ♪ ♪ scat a song ♪ ♪ oo le oo le oo hoo ♪ ♪ woo woo ♪ ♪ ooh hip ba da wa ♪ ♪ ooh hip ba da wa ♪ ♪ choo choo ba de do ♪ ♪ dow be be da ba ♪ ♪ sing along, da be da ooh le ooh ♪ ♪ I'm going to march, march, march ♪ ♪ I'm going to march, march, march ♪ ♪ along the Avenue ♪ ♪ I'm gonna sing, sing, sing ♪ ♪ my lucky song ♪ ♪ I'm going to fly, fly, fly ♪ ♪ like little birdies do ♪ ♪ spread your wings ♪ ♪ spread your wings ♪ ♪ and come along ♪ ♪ I'm goin' to live, live, live it up ♪ ♪ along the way ♪ ♪ so tell me ♪ ♪ how can things go wrong ♪ ♪ hey, brother, what a heyday ♪ ♪ this has been my lucky payday ♪ ♪ and my lucky song ♪ ♪ wanna give ♪ ♪ wanna give ♪ ♪ wanna spread this happy stuff around ♪ ♪ wanna sing ♪ ♪ wanna dance ♪ ♪ wanna raise my feet right off the ground ♪ ♪ I'm goin' to march, march, march ♪ ♪ along the ♪ ♪ Avenue ♪ ♪ so tell me ♪ ♪ how can things go wrong ♪ ♪ hey, brother ♪ ♪ what a heyday ♪ ♪ this has been my lucky payday ♪ ♪ and my lucky song ♪ ♪ my luck-luck lucky song ♪ [horn honks] ♪ My luck-luck lucky song ♪ ♪ my luck-luck lucky song ♪ thank you. Good evening. Hi, eugie. I'm here to talk to the children and parents of the children, because if there weren't parents, there wouldn't be children, and vice versa. What I mean is, parents are necessary if you want children, and children are necessary if parents want them, if you know what I mean. Eugene! What are you doing in there? I'm here to tell you how bad comic books are for you. I never thought they were bad myself until my friend Rick Todd told me how bad they were. Well, I was wrong. Boy, was I wrong. And how right he was. I was wrong, you dope! And I almost became a dope, reading comic books. I realized that is why I am now a little retarded. You see, I was very slow in school. Matter of fact, I was so slow, I went to summer school in the wintertime. Uh, like the story you told me about, Mr. Baker... The 5-year-old kid that was caught stuffing his grandmother in the trunk compartment of the car. An extreme example of comic book influence. And any 5-year-old kid should know he's not old enough to drive a car. Have comic books influenced you to that extent? Oh, I didn't learn to drive until I was 8. Now, would you say you've learned anything from comic books? Oh, yes, yeah! Mm-hmm. Oh, boy, yes. I learned, particularly I learned how to grow poison plants in a window sill flowerpot, uh, how to keep the tarnish off brass knuckles, also, how to start a fire by rubbing two gasoline cans together. Whew! What a fire that makes. Also, how to make a hangman's knot. And last but not least, how to prepare rat poison so that it spreads like peanut butter. I see. And now you realize this knowledge is dangerous. Oh, yes, it is very dangerous. Oh, it's pretty danger... Real dangerous, all right. It gave me very bad dreams. Bad? They're worth a pile! What exactly did you dream? Well, that's the trouble. That's it right there. I never retained anything I dreamt. I never remembered anything, except my friend Rick said they were very bad dreams. Oh, yes. They were awful. I screamed and carried on. My subconscious was battling against my conscious, and the basic intelligence of my mind wouldn't allow myself to comprehend the problems that were forethought prior to sleeping, and at the same time not having any rest because of no sedation whatsoever to make my rest and dreams any righter or smarter than they were when I was much younger. Rick, we're home! Mrs. milldoon, you're much stronger than I am. We'll pay the rent, honest! I'm illustrating one of Eugene's stories. I know it'll sell. Sell, schmell. Eugene, your rent's paid. You give this to Mr. Todd for me. What are you... Ooh! What do you mean our rent's paid? Mr. Todd gave it to me in advance. Hee hee hee! Hee hee hee. I think Rick took that job with murdock. And if he did, we're not pals no more. Rick! Rick! Rick? Rick? Well, where you two been? Where'd you get the money to pay the rent? I've arrived, boy. I've arrived. It's me and Rembrandt now. We're neck-and-neck. Look. Oh, you sold a painting! Oh, Rick, that's wonderful. It was nothing. Matter of fact, I feel another masterpiece coming on right now. Aw... What is it, curly top? I thought you got the money for doing a comic book for Mr. murdock. That's from Mrs. milldoon, and that's from me. Thanks. Jury still out on you? Not guilty. Hey! Cute characters. Your boyfriend has a story idea for children's books. I'm going to illustrate them. My boyfriend. He's up to his ears with the bat lady. You should have told him it was you. I wanted him to go for me, not some costume you dreamed up. You weren't wearing a costume when he kissed you. You weren't wearing a costume when he kissed you. But I told you, he thought it was you coming back. You just be patient. He'll stop those crazy dreams and see you for your own charming self. Waah! Waah! Waah! Our song. Waah! All right, you said that. Ok, you said that. [Mumbling] Dream louder, louder. Waah! Vincent flaps his feeble wings as he tries to fly back to his space station before zuba gets to him. She looks across the water with her lavender eye and then moves in for the kill. Lavender eyes? You said purple eyes. One lavender, one purple, and one magenta. Three eyes? One in the back like a rear-view mirror. And she uses her beautiful body like a pair of pontoons. She sails across the jungle swamp, ready to sink her fangs into Vincent's jungular veins so she can get away with his secret power formula... X34 minus 5r1 plus 6-x36. [Muttering] Oh, boy. [Radio playing soft music] Bessie? Hmm? What do you suppose the stars would say about Rick? I've taken up numerology. I'm off the stars. They made me flip my little dipper and fall for a guy who's in love with a lady in black. I'll tell him you're the bat lady. No. I don't want to wear a mask the rest of my life. Some honeymoon with a pair of wings on my back. How's the numerology working out? You know, numerology's a science. I take the numbers... The day, month, and year I was born, I add to the day, month, and year Eugene was born. I divide that with my street address, then add that to my social security number. With that answer, I divide Eugene's social security number, then multiply that by the number of dancing lessons I take. The calories I eat in one day I subtract from that, then multiply by how tall I am, and that's the answer. It works out zero... Eugene again. That still doesn't help me with Rick. Could be you're in love with Rick, maybe. You don't fall in love with someone you've only seen a few times. I think I'd better put some oil on you. You're going to burn. Mmm. You have strong hands. Bessie? Hmm? I wonder... If he really likes me. I bet if he had the chance, he couldn't keep his hands off you. [Turning up the volume] I love this song.

Now, how's that for Freddie? Oh, he looks just like I dreamed he would. He's cute. He looks like you, Eugene. No, I'm not cute. They wanted to have me drowned when I was born, but the s.P.C.A stopped them. I know somebody else that thinks you're cute. Oh, you mean your bat lady model? I can't wait to meet her. She'll be dancing at the artists and models ball. You'll meet her then. Oh, you mean she dances too, like bessie? Almost exactly like bessie. Now, how about trying that goosey goose pose again? Oh, ok. Ok, Anita. Take five. How's it going? Oh, pretty good. You've changed. Now when I pose for you, all you do is draw. [Pounding on door] Rick! Rick! Rick! Y-yes? Come quick. Hurry! Is that why you've changed? Shh! You better change. Get dressed. Come back tomorrow at the same time. Eugene was posing for me. I think it's his sacroiliac. He can't straighten up. Come on, quick! He can't straighten up. [Telephone rings] Good afternoon. Eureka massage parlor. Our rub and steam will make you dream. Just a minute, I'll check. Bring him right in here. Yes, we can take you this afternoon at 5:30. We don't need your assistance, son. Run and have some alfalfa tea. We'll have him fixed up in no time. Oh... Think nothing of it. Oh, easy. Oh... Hurt? No. [Cracking] You're tougher than I thought. What have you been eating? [Cracking] Oh... Oh! Oh! [Cracking] Aah! All fixed up. [Cracking] Oh, easy. Easy, please. Oh... Aah. Oh... Oh! Aah! Oh, oh, oh. Ah, ah, ah. Oh, oh, pain. Oh, plenty of pain. Aah! Oh, I got to get new soles. Oh, easy, easy. Anyone for Taffy? Oh, wait, no. [Cracking] Wait a second. Oh, lady. Get this foot up... Oh, my leg's falling off. Oh, I'm sorry. Wait, just hold everything one second, please. Lady, one second. Rick, Rick! Wait one second. My friend will... Rick! We're in trouble a little here. You're in trouble? I'll help. Put your foot under hers. Brace her foot up. That's it, that's it. Under her? Lean back. That way? No, wait a second. Come around this way. Now brace your foot up over. That's it. That'll fix everything, huh? That's not working very good there. Lady... Lady, would you help here? Just grab... see my foot down there? Hold it and pull it up. That's it. Get up on the table. Come over... Bring this foot around here. That's good, hold it there. Hold my foot. Maybe I'll slip this one out... No, hold it. Hold everything. Rick, it's going to be all right. Wait, we'll get another lady. Sure, we need another lady. Give me this hand. Hold on there. Let go of that foot. Is there another lady? That's fine. You hold on to her. Good, like that. Lady! One lady. Could you get on the edge of the... It's going to be all right. I know. I'm fine. Miss, just bend down over here. Give me your hand. Good. Now hold on to him. That's fine. Now bring this leg over. Bring that leg over... No, bring this leg down here. That's fine. That's it. Now, look. Just get that leg over in this side. That's fine. Now bring it around there. Can you help her with this leg there? Maybe if she, uh... Wait, I tell you what, I'll see you at the apartment later. I don't think so. I may have lunch here. All right. See you later. Oh, what a mess. Wait a minute! Easy. It's a dime. That, gentlemen, is the final test of our new power formula. We can safely predict our nation will be the first to break through the earth's gravitational pull and establish a space station. Colonel drury here has been in charge of developing our secret power formula. It's not a secret any longer, general traynor. "X34 minus 5r1"? Well, that's half of our formula! My son bought that at the corner newsstand last night. You can't buy a top-secret at a corner newsstand. The murdock publishing company in New York disagrees with you, general. Get me the secret service on the phone immediately. Yes, general, I have the comic book before me. I'll put my best men on the assignment. This may be a clever way of conveying our secrets to the enemy. Find out if they have the remainder of our space station formula. [Whirring] Of course, the United States wouldn't publish top secrets in a comic book, but the formula works to a point. It's a trap. We cannot take a chance. If this cartoonist has the mathematic equations to take a space station beyond the earth's atmosphere, we must take the chance. All right. I leave it to an expert in these matters. My dear Sonia, where a man is concerned, you have never failed. This time, you have to work fast. Get to him quickly, directly. Become his friend, his, uh, closest companion. Yes, gentlemen. I am always their closest companion. Hello. Hello. I'm looking for a man. They never let me dress with the girls. His name is Todd. Oh, he isn't here. He's my roommate. I'm Eugene stackfull... I mean fullstack. Oh... Oh, here you are. Thank you. Will he be long? I don't know. Is there anything I can do? I doubt it. I'll wait. I'd like to stay and check my thermometer, but I have to go see a man about a costume. We're a smash, Todd! The presses are working overtime! We're selling on the black market in Boston! I told you that zuba was all girl! Look at her! By the way, you've met my, uh, cousin, haven't you? When you meet her, you meet your whole family. Look! The vulture brass knuckles! Guaranteed no rust! And look at this, Rick. Right according to your specifications, just the way you drew it. The death-dealing disintegrator atom gun. Watch this. Mmm! Real nice, very nice. A couple more issues, we'll make them forget Hitler. Now, wait, don't get squeamish, Todd. Why don't you, your daughter, and your niece tell your wife off? I'm through, Mr. murdock. I got to go, go, go. Say goodbye to your... Uncle. But you... What's going on down there? [Jimmy stewart] Well, it seems like Todd told murdock off, and he's leaving. Of course, I can't see so well from this rear window. Todd. Yeah? Secret service? I've been telling you. Eugene dreams the space formula. He doesn't know what he's saying in his sleep. We've got to know if the formula's tucked away in his subconscious. Check on fullstack's dreams. Take the tape recorder. If they go, then I got to tell Eugene I'm doing the vulture. We'll be through as pals. Can't they come after when he's asleep? All right, but I'm holding you responsible. Don't let fullstack out of your sight. We don't want him dreaming for our enemies. I'll stick with him, sir. I appreciate your cooperation, Todd. The president might invite you to the white house. I doubt that. Why? I shoot in the low 70s. Nothing. He must keep the rest of the formula in his head. Get him to the laboratory tonight. Don't worry. Hello. Hello. Mr. Todd? If I'm in the right apartment, I'm Mr. Todd. I am Mrs. Thomas Curtis. Your roommate let me in. He left. That's the smartest thing he's ever done. I've heard what a fine artist you are, and I came to see your paintings. It's beautiful. Lovely. I like them very much. That makes two of us. You see, I would like to have my portrait painted, and after seeing your work, I am sure you could do me very well. Thank you. I'll do my best. What size portrait would you want... full-length or bust? I had full-length in mind. I'll show you what I mean. I would like to give it to my third husband as a surprise present. My congratulations to all three of them. What do you think of this pose, Mr. Todd? You could do a big calendar business. If you don't approve, what do you suggest? I'm not knocking it. I think if you had this arm up a little there. That's it. And, um... Head down. Yes, yes. I like this much better. You see, I want something intimate. Something I can hang over the bar. With you hanging there, they won't need any liquor. Could you start working on me right now? Don't you think it's a little late for that? We could go to my house. My husband is away, and we wouldn't be disturbed. We would be quite alone. Just the two of us. Hey, Rick! Who'll put the ice on my neck? [Knock knock] Hey, Rick! If I have a neck left. Just a minute, honey. Slight intermission, Mrs. Curtis. Well. Oh, hello, darling. Hi. Where's Eugene? Eugene? I thought I heard you talking. Eugene. Oh, well, he's taking off his clothes, and he's taking a shower. Oh, well, ask him what he's wearing tonight. Tell him the bat lady wants to know so she'll recognize him. Ok. I'll ask him. [Shower starts] Hello, Abigail. Eugene! You're taking a bath. Yeah, 'cause I'm going to wear my new costume. It's the first time I had my own head. No, you're taking a bath now. All right, Abigail, but don't rush me. Eugene, Abby wants to know what you're wearing tonight. I'm going to wear my... Who's he talking to? Yes, who was he talking to? All right. I'll tell her. What did he say? He's wearing his Freddie field mouse costume. Why don't I talk to Eugene? He's taking a shower. You'll get... You'll get all wet. He's taking a shower. You'll get all wet. Got dry in a hurry, didn't you? There's no one there. Just my mother. It's a surprise. She's from steubendale. Oh, mother. Mother? I can explain this, Abby. Not to me, you can't. Watch out for the bit with the suntan oil, mother. Mother? Entertain Mrs. Curtis while I talk with Abigail. Entertain her? Wow! Here we are. Sit right there. Not that... not that way. Do your boy scout bird calls. What bird call are you particularly interested in, Mrs. Curtis? Do you know the Hungarian kiwi? The Hungarian kiwi? You mean the Hungarian peewee. In Hungary we don't have peewees. We only have kiwis. In Hungary you don't have peewees. You only have kiwis. You don't know the Hungarian kiwi? No, I don't know the Hungarian kiwi. The Hungarian peewee, I know. Good. Good. To tell you the truth, I mostly know the steubendale bird... Like, uh, the pizza bird that goes... [Whistles] Goomba. She's got to be a phony, Mr. Samuels. Right away she turns on her heater and goes overboard trying to get me to her place. I played along until I could call you. Very smart, Todd. If she didn't show any interest in Eugene, she doesn't know he has the formula. Now, keep playing along. There may be others with her. Here's what you do. Tonight after the artists and models ball... What if Mrs. Curtis doesn't want to go to the ball? What? I can't do that, Mr. Samuels. I'm in love with another girl. It's my duty to the United States of America? Are you sure? If I'd known that, I'd have joined the FBI instead of the kangaroo patrol. Ok. Oh, boy. Aah! You bucking for a nosebleed or something? I can't keep this dickey down, Ricky. Anybody tell you dickeys went out with horse cars? If you're going to rent, rent a modern dress shirt, something like about 1922. There. That does it. Thank you very... Thank you very much. I got to look nice, 'cause I'm meeting the bat lady tonight. If she's wearing a bustle, you'll make a dandy-looking pair. Yeah. There. Oh, what am I going to do, Rick? Every time the bat lady comes near me, she'll get an uppercut. I got an idea. Button the dickey on the top of the shorts. Let me do it. Wait a minute. Here? This button, huh? Yeah, that will hold everything down. Oh, yeah. Thanks, Rick. Good. Now, hurry up. We're going to be late. I'll be there as soon as I put my shoes on. Wonder if I can walk at all. Something's crooked. I think something's been... Wait, this way. Over there. That's it. Something's pulling me. Yeah. I'll be right... Right there, Rick. Wait, bessie. You were great. It's just the numerology. Hurry up, girls. Step on it. Artists and models number. Todd, fullstack, you're on. We'll be pals forever? Pals forever. Scout's honor? Scout's honor. Kangaroo patrol. Kangaroo patrol. Pouches forever. Hippity-hop, hippity-hop-kangaroo. Hippity-hop, hippity-hop-kangaroo. Hippity-hop, hippity-hop-kangaroo. K-a-n-g-a-r-o-o... ooh! You ready?

Why don't we go upstairs where you can take a nap? Your voice sounds very familiar. I think we met before. Call the secret service. Tell them where we are. This sure is a cozy place you have. This is our little nest. You could breed locomotives in this little nest. Ha ha ha. Are you all right? Just get me a new liver. We got to get over here. Come, darling. Let's go upstairs. Come, come.

If I want mystery, I watch dragnet. First we'll have a drink, darling. Sit down. I'll be right back. I'll have celery tonic on the rocks. [Whistles] This will do it. To us... Darling. Uh, to our troubles. May they never be little ones. Are you wearing that mask because there's something wrong with your nose? There's nothing wrong with my lips. There is something wrong. What? When bessie kisses me, the tops of my shoes pop open. Would you mind if I tried again? Thank you. I'm sorry. Bessie's the one. Sorry. Well, then I wish you all the luck. Here's to bessie. I'll drink to that. You're a good loser, I don't mind saying. To bessie sparrowbush. Well, thanks for the drink. It was wonderful. You're welcome. Good night. Night. Waah! Waah! Waah! He's dreaming. Waah! Goosey goosey 221. Freddie Freddie 711. Goosey goosey, Freddie Freddie. [Whistles] What's this goosey goosey, Freddie Freddie?

Eugene, wake up! Eugene, wake up! Huh? You're sleepy. So sleepy. Oh, sleepy. They're in the garden. Waah! He's up there. Waah! Zuba comes after Vincent. She sinks her teeth into his goose feathers. "What's the formula?" She asks. Waah! She's hurting Vincent's mousetrap. He has to tell. The secret formula is... Kangaroo patrol! Kangaroo patrol! Kangaroo patrol! K-a-n... G-a-r... O-ooh-o. Ivan!
