(Rydal) Take a look at that view. Spectacular, isn't it? It was here, on the Acropolis hill, that some believe Theseus's father, King Aegeus, looked out to sea, waiting for his son to return. See, Theseus had promised his father that if he defeated the Minotaur, he'd hoist a white sail on his ship as a tribute but he was so excited to get back home he forgot and he flew the same black sail that he set outwith. Well, thinking his son was dead, the heartbroken king flung himself onto the rocks below, another victim of the cruel tricks gods play on men. Well, I hope you ladies brought your handkerchiefs, 'cause the next thing you're about to see has been known to make some weep at first sight. Follow me. Completed in 438 BC, the Parthenon. From the Greek word "parthenes", meaning "virgins". "The ancient Greeks were masters of deception. "Even though the base of the Parthenon appears straight to the naked eye, "it is, in fact, completely crooked. "Indeed, if one were to leave one's hat on one side of the temple steps, "it would vanish altogether when viewed from the other." - You're making this up. -Well, only one way to find out. - Oh. All right. (chuckles) -Wanna try it? Come on. All right, you go on down there, I'll put the hat right here. - Mmm-hmm. -Off you go. (Chester) Mmm, mmm, mmm! -(Colette) I hear that. -(chuckling) - Is this far enough? -That's perfect. Oh, my God, you're right. Really? -(chuckles) No. -Aw, jeez. Sucker born every minute. (Chester) Good one, baby. (Colette) I got you. Ah, Well. Let's go and get in the shade. Gosh, it's so hot. Yeah. Getting bored of the Parthenon? (Lauren laughing) - No, no, no. -Come on, we have to finish the bottle. I was supposed to meet my friends an hour ago. Oh, you just tell them you got lost. I'm a terrible tour guide. -(both laughing) -(waiter speaks Greek) -(responds in Greek) -Let me get this. No, no, no, I got it. I got it. - Thank you. -it's my pleasure. Actually, do you have any small bills, change? - I think so. -Shall I take a look? - Yeah. Honestly, I'm not sure. -(chuckles) Okay. All right, so it's four drachmas. So if I take five and $10, I'll give you back 200 drachmas. - Good? -Okay. Thank you. (chuckles) True story. She's very pretty, isn't she? Oh, no, I was... I was looking at the guy that she's with. He reminds me of my father a little bit. (Colette) it says we should go to the flea market on Sunday. Apparently it's less crowded. Don't look now but there's a young guy in a grey shirt sitting with a girl in a blue-and-white-striped dress. He was at the Parthenon earlier, staring at me. He's staring at me now. - Hang on a minute. -Yeah. (sighs) Now I'm curious. (in Greek) It's occupied. Oh, I'm sorry. I don't speak Greek. Somebody's in there. - You're American? -Yeah. - Where are you from? -I'm from Trenton. - New Jersey? -Yeah. - I thought you were Greek. -I thought you were Greek. (snickers) -(chuckles) -What are you doing in Athens? Uh, I'm a tour guide. Do you need one? He's an American tour guide, he's been here a year and before that he went to Yale. - Do you believe him? -You can ask him yourself. He's going to show us round the flea market Sunday. (Chester) Rydal. Fancy. (Chester) So Colette tells me you went to Yale. (Rydal) Yes, sir. - What did you major in? -Economics. Hmm. Good training for a tour guide. Yeah, well, that wasn't the plan initially. My father had a job lined up at a friend's law firm and... (Chester) And you ran away as fast as you could. (Rydal) Something like that. What do you do for a living, sir? Call me Chester. I look after people's savings. Mostly low-risk investments. How much? (both speaking Greek) 20 drachmas. (Chester) There you go. (speaks Greek) A steal. You must be doing pretty well, though, if you're staying at the Grand. Honey, look at this. It's beautiful, isn't it? (Chester) Sure is. Actually, you know what? This is a Cretan design. You see how the snakes come together and never end? That represents immortality. People wear it as a protection charm. Oh. - You like it, hon? -I love it. Well, let's get it, then. How much is it? (in Greek) One thousand drachmas. Two thousand drachmas. (in Greek) Come on, seven hundred. (in Greek) Okay. All right, so 1,500, which is about $50. - Fifty bucks? -Good deal. Uh, will he take dollars? Well, you can give me dollars and I'll give him, uh, drachmas. Oh. Okay, friend. (in Greek) Well done. - Yeah. -it's gorgeous. Say, why don't you join us for dinner? - Would you do that? -Sure, yes. I'd love to. - But I'm meeting a friend later. -She can come, too. No, it got so bad that we started counting how many times a day the Parisians would insult us. We got up to 15 one night, nine in the same restaurant. -(laughing) -Was it your first time there? Mmm. Chester helped liberate Paris. -(Lauren) Oh, really? -All by myself. You fought in the war? Just the last part. Whereabouts? Normandy. The Ardennes. A few other places. Wow. Heck of a joint you picked out. It's modelled after the old Ottoman cafés. - Huh. Great guide, isn't he? -Mmm, wonderful. - Knows everything. -Mmm-hmm. He's an even better writer. - Is that so? -(Lauren) Mmm-hmm. (Chester) What do you write? (Lauren) The most beautiful poems. -(scoffs) -He is going to be famous one day. Happy or depressing poems? Unpublished poems, mostly. Well, I'm sure you'll find plenty of inspiration in Greece. (Colette) And your first date was yesterday? Um, the day before. - Oh, the day before. Okay. -(Lauren chuckles) (music playing on speakers) That's the sound and light show. I can get you tickets if you're interested, tomorrow night. Best seats in the house. Thanks but, uh, unfortunately, we're... We're leaving tomorrow. - Oh, really? -Yeah. I wanted to show Colette Rome and Venice before we go back to the States. So... How about you? Any plans to go home soon? Uh... Yeah, at some point, when I run out of money. Doesn't sound like you're in a big hurry. Oh, thanks. Well, Chester, I got to figure out what I want to do first. Sure. You know, that's the best thing about being your age. There's a surprise around every corner. Yeah, I guess so. Did you know that she was a Van Buren? - Who's that? -Your friend Lauren. - I only just met her. -Mmm-hmm. Was he the seventh or the eighth President? - He was the eighth. -(both chuckling) - No, I'm... I'm... Come on. -I know, I know. Hey, listen, I've been married twice. Both times to beautiful women with no money. And I can say this because I love Colette and I'm a little tanked -but it can be a burden. -(laughing) Yeah, well, I don't think she's all that interested. - Oh, no? Hey, ladies. -No, don't... What are you two gossiping about? - None of your business. -See? All right, all right. - It was so nice to meet you. -it was so nice to meet you. (Lauren) Thank you for dinner. Thanks for taking such good care of us. My pleasure. Well, I hope we meet again sometime. Me, too. - Enjoy Rome. -Oh, well, we'll try. -(laughing) -Thank you very much. - Goodnight, son. -(Lauren) Good night. (Rydal) Goodbye. Well, what did you think? She's very sweet. Wouldn't trust him to mow my lawn. (chuckling) I thought he was very interesting. Oh, yeah? Well, that's 'cause he couldn't keep his eyes off you all night. No. Does he still remind you of your father? He's a lot easier to talk to. Where are you taking us on our last day? Sounion. I wish we were staying longer. (Rydal) on. She forgot her bracelet. (speaks Greek) - Everything all right in there? -(Colette) Uh-huh. Now we're talking. (both chuckling) Oh, yeah. -(giggling) -Come on. Get out of here. (knocking on door) No, thank you. -(knocking continues) -(chuckling) (speaks broken Greek) - Fuck off. -(laughing) (Colette exclaims) (Colette) Just put the "Do Not Disturb" on. No, thank you. Mr Donlevy? No. - Your name's not Donlevy? -No. No, no. I think you got the wrong room. How about Mr MacFarland? - Yes. -May I come in? (Chester) Uh, can I ask what it's about? (man) Stock market. Canadian oil shares. (Chester) Oh, I see. Hang on right here, I'll just get my coat and we'll go downstairs. We can talk about it right in here. - No, let's just go to the bar. -Right in there'd be great. I'm sorry to barge in on you like this, ma'am. - Are you sure you don't want me to wait? -it's fine. You get back to the hotel. All right? - I'll call you in the morning. Bye. -Okay. You ran a brokerage firm called Donlevy & Walters back in New York. That's right. You with the Embassy? (scoffs) No. I represent some very unhappy clients who invested their money with you. You ought to be more careful who you do business with. Listen, I'm sorry your clients are upset but I can't help it if the market crashes. (chuckles) This is a nice hotel. Just like all the other nice hotels you've been staying at. I've been following your trail all across Europe, Mr MacFarland. And you've been throwing a lot of cash around. - How long is the trip to Mycenae? -A whole day, madam. Semper fi, h u h ? (scoffs) - You a Marine? -No. Infantry. - Army. -Yeah. It's funny, you know? All that time over here during the war, I could give a shit about Europe. Yet here I am again. (chuckles) Here's the deal. I could care less about your other investors. You reimburse my clients, I'll go back home to my family and leave you and your lovely wife alone. My wife has nothing to do with this. Look, why don't you and I go downstairs, have a drink, see if we can come to an arrangement? Unfortunately, I'm not authorised to negotiate with you. I'm just here for the money. Yeah. Okay, well, let me go and get it. (clattering) Chester? (yells) -(Colette) Chester? -Don't come in! - Hello. Hello. -Hi. Uh, I need to return something to some friends of mine, the MacFarlands. - They're in room 505. -505, okay. ls there a phone I can use? - The house phone is right over there. -Ah. Thank you. (panting) (telephone ringing) - Don't answer it! Don't answer it. -What's happening? He's fine. He fell. He hit his head pretty bad. I gotta take him downstairs, get him some help. I thought you said no one would follow us. Open the door! (breathing heavily) Get dressed, start packing. We gotta get out of here right away. (panting) Oh, my God. No. (lift bell dings) (breathing heavily) (grunts) Can you, uh... Can you help me get this guy's door open? - What happened? -He's hammered, that's what happened. Found him in the lobby. (exhales) Good evening. - Evening. -Hi. (Chester mumbling) (grunts) Oh, Christ! - Is he okay? -He'll be fine. He's going to have an almighty hangover tomorrow, though. (scoffs) Who is he? (sighs) I haven't the foggiest idea. Some drunk. He tried to paw Colette in the elevator, then followed us to our room. I smacked him. (Chester panting) Let's let him sleep it off. Oh. Your wife left it in the cab. I was bringing it back. Truth is... I owe some people money. They sent him. He threatened us with a gun. Look. You know, I don't know what to do. I mean, I don't know if he's alone or there's somebody else in the lobby. All I know is we gotta get out of this hotel before that man wakes up. Can you help us? Thank you. (sighs) (Rydal) Sorry, it's not the Grand. (Colette) No, it's perfect. Feels like New York. Oh, is that you? -(Rydal) Yeah, with my dad. -Is he back home? Uh, he passed away a month ago. I'm sorry. So, uh, have you figured out who he is yet? Private detective. I got in trouble with a gambling syndicate back home. Made some investments for them that didn't work out. Sent this guy after us. (sighs) God knows who else. Well, the airport opens up in a few hours and you'll be gone before the guy wakes up. (exhales) Hotel took our passports when we checked in. - You don't have your passports? -No. Well, I... I mean, I can try to go get them for you but I don't think they're going to give them to me. No, it wouldn't be safe, anyway. Might be more of them waiting for us. I don't know, I gotta get Colette out of here. We need new passports, new identities. I have a friend that I get American cigarettes from. He might know somebody that could help you out. (door opening) (footsteps approaching) You Okay? No. He's going to help us. We'll fly out of here soon. Where? We'll see. I'm sorry. (Rydal) Chester? We should go. (in Greek) He's old enough to be her father. (scoffs) Okay, my friend can arrange the new passports for $1,000 each. Okay. So... - Half now, half on delivery or... -(in Greek) What has he done? (in Greek) He just has to get out of the country. (in Greek) Yes, but why? Excuse me. Look... When will the passports be ready? Mmm. Five days. - No, no... -(Niko) Maybe four. We can't hang around Athens that long. (sighs) (in Greek) Can you bring the passports to one of the islands? (in Greek) I don't know. How much trouble is he in? (in Greek) Niko, he'll pay us. We can make a lot of money. For another $1,000, he can deliver the passports to Crete. Crete? (Rydal) Yeah, no one's going to look for you there. That's... I mean, I don't know Crete from a hole in the ground. Where am I... (in Greek) Are you joking? This guy hasn't got a clue. - I'm kidding. I'm kidding... -(in Greek) This is bullshit. -(in Greek) I'm not getting involved. -What's the matter? No, no, no. I should come with you. -(Chester) What? -I should come with you. (Chester) No, no, no, no. You're not going to know your way around. I can go with you. You would do that? Yes. - I'd certainly make it worth your while. -it's okay. It's not about the money. No, I know, but you deserve... (Rydal) You're going to have to pay him another $500. (Chester) Oh. So, 1,500 more? Yeah. Did you give him any money for the drinks? I offered. Well, you should have insisted. He's probably too proud to accept. (scoffs) Trust me, he's doing fine. What's that supposed to mean? Means he already skimmed his commission. - Why else do you think he's helping us? -I'm sure it's not just the money. (scoffs) No. I think he's also got a thing for you. Either way, we need him. At least for a few more days. - Hey, buddy. -Coffee's cold and the beer's warm. - Thank you. -You're welcome. - Thanks. -Anything interesting in the newspaper? The Greeks and Turks are at each other's throats again. (sighs) (man talking indistinctly on radio) Hey, honey, do you mind going in and seeing what's taking him so long? Please? (both speaking Greek) (Chester) What gives? Well, we can't check in without all three passports. Why not? It's a legal requirement. Apparently it's the same everywhere in lraklion, but if we go to a smaller town, they might be more relaxed about the rules. - Where do you have in mind? -Chania. It's up the coast and there's a bus that leaves first thing in the morning. - In the morning? -Yeah. We could stay up. It's warm enough. And you can leave your suitcases here. Uh, no. I think I'll hang on to 'em. (Colette) My father almost had a heart attack when I left home. He said, "New York has turned its back on God "and you should be very careful, youngladyP - Oh, Lord. -(Greek traditional music playing) (chuckles) Taverna Asterion? What is Asterion? Asterios is a minotaur. So Asterion would have been... -grandfather. -(Rydal chuckles) Actually, it's the same name. Asterios, Asterion. It's just, uh, different pronunciation, but it's the same thing. But it is confusing. Who knew? - Where did you live? -On Hudson and 11th. I shared an apartment with three Barnard... I'm fading. I don't know if I can stay up much longer. Well, order some coffee. I think I might have another Scotch. So how did the two of you meet? (Colette) Well, I crashed one of his parties with a girlfriend. It was like nothing I'd ever seen. There was champagne and caviar and millionaires everywhere. Gargon! May I have a cigarette, please? (speaking Greek) (Chester) Thank you. -(Rydal) Sorry. -Thank you. You must be awfully good at languages to pick up Greek so quickly. I had a head start. My, uh... father made me and my sisters learn different languages since we could practically speak, so every month there'd be a different language. French and then Italian and Russian. - Russian? -Can I keep the bottle? (Rydal speaking Russian) And the thing is, when he'd overhear us speaking English, we'd get demerits. There was this chart on the hall and even my poor mother would get on it now and then. (Colette) And what did your father do? He was Professor of Archaeology at Harvard. - Wow. -Yeah, he certainly thought so. And you don't? See, my old man drove a truck for a living. He didn't teach us very good English, never mind French or Russian. Impressive. - Yeah. -Yeah. It is. I'd like to dance. Okay. Yeah. Can I finish my scotch first? Rydal? Knock yourself out. (man singing in Greek) (laughing) (people cheering) (Chester groans) - You all right? -(Chester) Yeah. (Colette grunts) - Let me help you. -I got it! Honey. Honey... I just want to sit here and finish my cigarette. - Are you sure you're all right? -Stop asking me that! Bus leaves in a few hours. We just have to hang in there. Go ahead. I'll... I'll catch up. - Hey, I hope that, uh... -You know what? Just run along, Rydal. Run along. (sighs) I bet you wish you'd never met us. No. No, I'm glad I did. (Colette) He's mad at himself. Not you. (coughs) (sighs) Shit. (repetitive wet thudding) (groans) (both greeting in Greek) (ordering in broken Greek) And, uh, one of them. - Doughnut? -Doughnut, yeah. (Chester) Morning. I brought you a Greek doughnut. Thanks. It's good. (Chester) Heard the sea when I woke up and thought we were back at the beach house on Long Island. (breathes deeply) Hey. When we get our new passports, I'll straighten things out with those guys in New York. We'll be home soon. (Rydal) Morning. Morning. (sighs) We should get going if we're going to catch the bus. (people chatting in Greek) Hey, Rydal. How long are we stopping here? I don't know. It depends how long the bus driver takes to eat. (woman speaking Greek) Can I get you something? Uh... Yeah. Beer would be nice. Okay, I got it. Hey, Rydal. Uh... I want to apologise for last night. I was out of line. Colette told me your dad passed away recently. I didn't know. I'm sorry. (man on radio, in Greek) Police are investigating the death of an American national at the Grand Hotel in Athens. The man, in his 50s, was discovered by hotel staff yesterday morning. (bus door closes) (engine starts) He died. It's all over the news. You have to turn yourself in. it was self-defence. - He pulled a gun... -They mention any suspects? No, but they have... They have your passports. It's just a matter of time. - If you turn yourself in... -They'll arrest you as an accomplice. Witnesses saw both of us with the body in the hotel hallway. You arranged fake passports for us. - No, no, no, no... -You accompanied us to Crete. And now you're carrying, what, an extra $1,000 of my money in your pocket? I'm trying to help you. I know. I know you are. Did you know he was dead? Colette doesn't. I'd prefer it if she didn't find out. (sighs) (woman speaking Greek) (man speaking Greek) (women laughing and chatting) I'm finally in a good mood and now you two are sulking. What's the matter? - Just a little tired. -I bet I can make you laugh. (chuckles) (both laughing) - Finish your ozo and I'll try again. -it's ouzo. O-U-Z-O. - Four letters. -Well, it tastes like gasoline to me. Hey, you want to share some oysters, hon? The guidebook says it's a bad idea to eat shellfish here. Well, the Greeks have been doing it for thousands of years. But I'm sure your parochial guidebook's probably right. Better to eat shellfish from some dirty New York kitchen than right here by the sea where it's caught in front of your eyes. - I wish I was in New York right now. -Oh, skip it. Of course, we can't go back to New York. We can't go anywhere in the States, because Chester's business ventures have been such a huge success. There's three of us here at the table. I'm sure Rydal doesn't want to hear you whine about how homesick you are. All right, why don't you lay off her? Who? My Wife? -(Colette) Don't rise to it. -No, let him. Let's hear what's on his mind. (sighs) Don't you ever speak to me like that again. Or what? Are we going to talk about this? (Colette) We had an argument. There's nothing to talk about. Are you sure? Or is there going to be another black mark against me? (sighs) Look, I got upset. I don't like you discussing my business in front of him. He could use it against us. - That's ridiculous. -Is it? He's done nothing but lie to us. I mean, do you believe any of that Harvard-Yale crap? I don't really care. It's not like we've been straight with him. Why are you defending him? Because I like him. And I appreciate what he's doing for us. Yeah. You like him? I didn't mean it like that. (Colette sighs) (man on radio, in Greek) Police are yet to name any suspects, but it is believed they are focussing their search in Athens and the border crossings with Yugoslavia and Albania. -(knocking) -($Deaking Greek) (Colette) It's me. One second. (turns radio off) - Hi. -Hi. I thought I'd take a walk but I don't know what there is to see in this town. Uh, ruins? (chuckles softly) Your room's smaller than ours. Well, there's only one of me. Anything interesting happening in the outside world? Well... Soccer. - Where's Chester? -Oh, he was up all night. He's taken a sleeping pill. Oh. You keep a diary? Yeah, it's just notes for my work. Anything about me and Chester? Maybe there's a line or two. Are you coming with me? For a walk. Sure, yeah, I'll come with you. Good. (gasps) Sweetie? (bells tolling) Uh, excuse me. I have no idea where I am. I, uh... How do I get downtown? (speaking broken Greek) You know, where the people gather? - Whisky? -Whisky. Tell the driver that I just want to drive around. - I'm looking for my wife. -Okay. Ah, wife. Sure, yes. - Go inside. (chuckles) -(Chester) Okay. Oh, my friend, you pay first. - Pay first? -Yes. - How much is it? -(man) I show you. I show you. Where are you going? Where are you going? Yeah, I don't know where I'm going. Just tell him... - Fifty. -Fifty, yeah. - Okay, thanks. -(chuckles) Go inside. You understand? I just want to drive around. Good luck with your wife. Hang on, stop. Stop, stop, stop! Stop a second. Colette? (man speaking Greek) Colette? - Oh, I'm sorry. -(man grunts) Hey! (grunts) (in Greek) Stop! Stop it! Can't you see he's drunk? Stop! Stop, stop. The cops are coming. Go. Get out of here. (crowd clamouring) (in Greek) What's going on here? (in Greek) Nothing. - Oh, he just sucker-punched me. -Shush. Come on. Where the hell were you, anyway? Where have you guys been? Please, please, calm down. - Did you sleep with him? -No. You see what he's doing? He's trying to tear us apart. - This whole trip... -What are you talking about? Calm down. He told you, didn't he? Did he tell you? - What are you talking about? -He was... - Told me what? -The guy hit his head. All right? He had a gun. What am I supposed to do? I was trying to protect you. I was trying to protect you. Forget it. Forget it! (door opens) - Why didn't you tell me? -He asked me not to say anything. - He thought that you would panic. -He killed someone. Why would you lie for him? I didn't do it for him. You shouldn't have done it for either of us. Those people that are after him, what did he do? He swindled them. He sold them shares in an oil field that didn't exist. Them and hundreds of other people. How much did you know? He's my husband. I'll call my friend in the morning, see if your passports are ready. Then what? Hide someplace else? Change our names? I can't live like that any more. (Rydal) What do you want me to do? (Colette) I just want to go home. (sighs) (in Greek) How soon can you get the passports to lréklion? (in Greek) Tomorrow morning. I'll see you at Cafe' Astir at eight. (in Greek) I'll be there. (in Greek) You didn't tell me he's wanted for murder. I didn't know. (in Greek) He's got plenty of money. I think it's better if you and Colette don't sit next to each other. Then why don't you and I sit together? Do you mind, sweetie? (speaking Greek) (speaking Greek) Shit. What? Hey! Oh, for Pete's sake. Hey! Hey! - What the hell's going on? -She thinks they recognised her. - Nobody recognised you. -She says they recognised her. - Get back on the bus! Let's go! -No! Get your hands off of me! This is all your fault! Don't blame me. Listen to me. (driver, in Greek) I can't wait for you. (in Greek) Sorry! (in Greek) The girl doesn't feel well. (in Greek) How far is it to lréklion? (in Greek) Five kilometres. Past the ruins at Knossos. - I'm sorry. -Don't touch me. (birds screeching) - You should get some rest. -You get some rest. I'm fine. I'm going to have a look around. (sighs) (thunder rumbling) -(thunder cracking) -Hey, wake up! Let's go. Come on, wake up, sweetie. Let's go. Let's get you out of the rain. We gotta go. Thanks. I'm going to go see if there's somewhere we can rest. I'll be right back. - Colette. .. -(clattering) Chester? Chester! I'm going to go look for him. Okay? Stay here. Chester? Chester? (grunts) Rydal? Did you find him? - Where's Rydal? -Forget about Rydal. What have you done to him? Nothing. Come on, let's go. - Tell me! -He's fine! - Where is he? -We don't need him! I'm sorry, I know I screwed up. I'll make it up to you. We can start over. It's too late. - Don't say that! 498595) (screams) Colette! Oh! Oh, no. No. No! No! No. No, no, God, no! No! No, no, no! No! (screaming) (sobbing) Oh, no, no, no. (wailing) (Chester wailing) Where's Rydal? He ran away with my wife. You got my passport? Another 2,500 like we agreed. (sighs) - You see the newspapers? -Mmm-hmm. - Could be a problem for me. -Yeah. But a much bigger problem if I get caught. (groaning) (groaning) Oh, God. (woman speaking Greek) (greeting in Greek) (ship's horn blowing) Son of a bitch. Truth is we're joined at the hip. I get caught, I take you down. You get caught, you turn me in. I guess you must have thought of that or you would have gone to the cops. You have no idea what I'm thinking. I know you wouldn't be here if you didn't have a little larceny in your veins. How much do you want? I don't know, you were married to her. How much do you think she was worth? I'll give you $5,000. Oh, I bet you have a lot more than that in your suitcase. 10,000. That's it. I don't want your money. I wanted your wife. (gasps) Don't you ever mention my wife again! (door clattering) (groaning) aaughs) (in Greek) Are you all right? (in Greek) I had too much to drink. Whoo! (in Greek) You should be careful in this weather. (in Greek) You could slip and fall overboard. (in Greek) Okay, I'll be careful. (groaning) (in Greek) Where are you from? (in Greek) Crete, sir. (in Greek) Documents? (in Greek) Did you visit Knossos? (in Greek) No, why? (in Greek) We're looking for someone seen at the ruins. (in Greek) Go and speak to my colleague, please. (in Greek) Could you go and speak to my colleague, please? (in Greek) Just over there, please. Over there? Okay, okay. Shit. (in Greek) Were you travelling alone in Crete? (in Greek) No, I was visiting my mother. (in Greek) Did you visit Knossos? (in Greek) Why would I go there? I was born in Crete. (in Greek) Where do you live now? (in Greek) Athens. (in Greek) What's your occupation? (in Greek) Musician. Come on, come on. - You live in Crete? -No, I'm American. Travelling alone? Uh... No. No, no, I'm... (officer) Hey! (speaking Greek) Yes? Is this your son? Uh... Well... Dad, he wants to know if I'm travelling alone. Yes, sir, I, uh... We were just in separate lines. Is there a problem? No, you can go. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Don't do anything stupid. Get your hands off me. - Now what? -I'm going to the airport. Me, too. (man on radio, in Greek) Reports indicate the victim was robbed... (Chester) Are they talking about her? ...as no valuables or identification were found on her. - What are they saying? -Shh! They think she was robbed. They didn't find anything on her. What else? (in Greek) A man in his 20s, believed to be a Greek national, was seen leaving the site by a group of students. Who are they describing, you or me? (woman speaking Greek over PA) (woman greeting in Greek) - Do you speak English? -Yes, sir. - What's your name? -Kynthia. Kynthia? - Very nice. -(scoffs) Bobby. Bobby Weidican. We, uh... We'd like two seats on the Frankfurt flight. Let me check, sir. (Kynthia speaking Greek) Go sit down and I'll take care of the tickets. Give me your passport. Just a second, sir. Frankfurt, huh? Yeah. Didn't your old man teach you German? You know, I saw a picture of you with your father in your little poem book. Looked like he cared a lot about you. Looks can be deceiving. Yeah. (chuckles) Why didn't you go to his funeral? Because he wouldn't have wanted me there. The problem is we expect too much from them. When I was a kid, I looked up to my father like he was a god. Then you grow up and they disappoint you a little more every day. - Well, uh... -Where are you going? I'm going to get a drink. - You want something? Coffee? -No. (man on PA, in Greek) Attention, please! Passengers for Flight 180 to Istanbul should proceed to the boarding gate. (speaking Greek) (indistinct chatter on radio) (woman on PA) Welcome aboard flight 0A 180 to Istanbul. Our captain has informed me that our flight time will be approximately one hour and 30 minutes. (breathes deeply) (telephone ringing) (continues ringing) (Rydal) Guess you should have killed me when you had the chance, huh? - Where are you calling from? -Oh, right across the bridge. How did you find me? I asked the girl at the ticket counter. Kynthia, wasn't it? (chuckles) Then I called every hotel in town, Mr Weidican. I want the money, all of it, or I'm going to give your new identity to the Feds. Listen, why don't you come over and we can have a drink and talk about it? I don't think so. Cafe' Sultan, jewellery quarter, Grand Bazaar. Twenty minutes. You shouldn't have tried to frame me for her murder. (hangs UP) (sighs) We're going to need a confession -or the deal's off. -Yeah, I know. You want something to drink? I'm afraid they don't serve alcohol. I'll have whatever you're having. (speaking Turkish) I see your old man taught you Turkish, too. You might find this hard to believe but I missed your company. You're the only person left in the world I can have an honest conversation with. Do you have it on you? Mmm-hmm. -10,000. It's all I have. -No, 10,000 won't do. (chuckling) You should be paying me. When we first met, you were short-changing college girls. Now look at you. A real criminal. There's something else I want. I want a picture of Colette. Take your pick. Was that even her real name? Colette? - Why did you try and frame me? -Do you really have to ask? Because she liked me? You know I slept with her? She wanted me to. She wanted a way out. That's all you meant to her. Some callow kid she would have forgotten in a minute. - Then why did you kill her? -She was the one thing I cared about. Now, why would I kill her? I don't expect you to understand now but one day you're going to wake up and you're going to look in the mirror and you're going to see someone who's not all that different from me. And you're going to realise that every hope and dream you ever had has slipped through your fingers and all you've got, if you're lucky, is someone like her. That's what you took from me! That's what I took from you? You tried to kill me. And you killed her. Admit it. Admit it. Let's go for a walk. I don't want to give you the money here. Welcome, sir. Hello. (men shouting) (shouting in Turkish) (men yelling) (shouting in Turkish) (speaking Turkish) (men speaking Turkish) (panting) (panting) (speaking Turkish) (indistinct shouting in distance) (in Turkish) We lost him on Aynicilar Street. (in Turkish) He must be heading for Rustam Square. (men shouting) (gunshot) (groans) Oh, shit. No, wait, wait. Let me talk to him. Let me talk to him! You wearing a wire? My name is Chester MacFarland. I'm guilty of fraud, ruining the lives of many men. I'm responsible for the death of a private detective. And the death of my wife. Rydal Keener had nothing to do with it. I framed him. Sorry I disappointed you. (Chester's laboured breathing plays on tape) Our embassy will arrange for your repatriation. You're free to go home. Where will he be buried? Well, we haven't been able to trace any next of kin, so he'll be buried here. Why? I thought I'd go to his funeral.
