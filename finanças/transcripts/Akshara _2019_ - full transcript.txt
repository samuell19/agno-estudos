AKSHARA SUICIDE DUE TO SCORING LOW MARKS PARAMESHWAR FROM VISAKHA We are happy to announce that... the best educational institute of this year award goes to Sanjay Bhargav. [applause] The power of modern education. I request the state education minister Mr Gangaram to present this award. Congratulations, sir. I request Mr Sanjay Bhargav to speak a few words. I thank the honourable education minister for giving me this award. Education is the foundation of this nation, is what I believe. During my education, my father came up with a list of five colleges as options and asked me to choose from them for admission. But now, I am giving only one option for the parents that is, my college, Vidya Vidhan. It is my students who have achieved this award, not me. I just ask two things to my students and their parents. What is the name of the student and what rank do they seek? Because, only those two things would come in the news on the day of announcement of results Whatever might be the newspaper or news channel, there won't be any second thought about which college. Because the only college which comes first all the time is my college. Parents dream a lot about their yet to be born children. And in those dreams, my college too exist. Dear... You need not become a doctor. Open your eyes once. Dear... My motive is to make students of my college as engineers and doctors. That is my ambition! [overlap of voices] Sir, is it murder or did she commit suicide? -Murder. -Who might have done it, sir? I pushed her down, went home took bath and came back. Sir, you received the award but your college student committed suicide. What's your response? I took came to know about it just now. We were told that she died due to study-pressure. What's your response? Will you kill the students by making them undergo severe pressure? If your question is right, would I have received this award? Two years ago, a Malaysian airlines went missing. It's report came recently. Since the pilot quarreled with his wife, he took that flight to remote location and crashed it. Who is the reason behind so many deaths, flight owner or pilot? Why go that far? The student who came to her house died in my college. What if I blame her parents? I'll enquire the truth. My college is the future of the nation, not a city graveyard. In a prominent college named Vidya Vidhan a female student jumped from the college building and died. Her parents and the student unions are protesting against it. Some student unions are accusing that she died due to pressure. -That's not the case. -Shut up! When she was climbing so many floors of the building, didn't a single person notice? Well, sir... She died out of pressure. Do you know who she is? She is a merit student who scored above 90%. It's been not even one hour that I took the award. All the media channels are trolling the college regarding this issue. If the word about her suicide due to pressure is out, do you know how students would depress before the exams? Dear students... I am Sri Teja, our college board director. Let me tell you a story. A group of birds went in search of a water bodies in summer. One bird, as they couldn't find any water body, became frustrated, lost confidence, and fell down from the sky at once. After that, the bird is dead. Suddenly, there's been a worry in those group of birds. Should they go back out of fear of the dead bird? Or should they muster the lost confidence of that dead bird and progress? That group took a good decision. When there is a quest to quench thirst, there shouldn't be any scope for despair. That's why, they have mustered confidence and flew up at once. Finally, they find a big pond. Since a bird was dead, the rest of the birds won't lose confidence. Similarly, you don't feel sad as your friend has died. She will be with you all the time in the form of your achievements. [music mutes voice] [students chatter] [weeping] Look there, sir. Jhansi... We made you wait for a long time for the interview. Didn't it enrage you? No, sir. I am in need of this job. My wedding is in the next month. It's okay. You can leave now. You will get a call. Akshara -Yes, sir. -You are being called. -Ms Akshara, -Sir. We called you for an interview and made you wait for 5 hours. Didn't it enrage you? If we don't have such patience, how can we teach to the students in the classroom? Mr Ramaswamy. Sir. I've already informed in the office. Type her appointment letter and give it to her. Okay, sir. What? You didn't even go through my resume. You didn't question anything about the subject. And you are offering the job? Your resume will tell your educational qualification. Asking a question would make us aware of your subject-grip. But those words that you wrote on the board would give a lot of confidence to several failed students to pass. Your patience in getting a job would reflect on our students' ranks. Just like you have mentioned about physics, action and reaction. The action took place. We are waiting for the reaction. Thank you, sir. WELCOME NANDANAVANAM COLONY-MEETING It's already late. Why didn't he come yet? -Greetings, Mr Dil Raju. -Greetings. -Greetings, Mr Adari Srinu. -Greetings. -Greetings, Mr Chinna. -Greetings. [Telugu song playing in background] Greetings, Kasturi. Greetings. Tell us why have you arranged this meeting. Firstly, I pray that the soul of Mr Bhaskar Rao's daughter finds peace. As the president of the colony, as a highly respected individual of the society I decided to celebrate the golden jubilee celebrations of our colony very grandly. We shall have colourful rangoli in front of every house, pandals with lighting and celebrate with full of fun. So, we need funds for that. Tell me the amount and the contributors. What the hell? Put aside collecting funds for a while. During the Hudhud cyclone, you have sold all the trees that fell. What happened to that amount? Hey President, last year, you said you'd install the tallest Lord Ganesh statue and collected 1000 rupees per household. But finally, you have installed the statue as small a mouse. What happened to the rest of the amount? Everyone, ask him. You too, madam. Question the president regarding the injustice of this colony. How dare you install hoardings on your birthday with our money? Who gave you this authority? You should resign immediately. [people shouting] You should resign . Stop! Why should I resign? Who sold the trees of this colony? Who is the reason behind missing money, poultry, and moreover, our colony's reputation as well? Am I the reason? We know! Those dirty Waltair Kings are the reason behind this colony losing its reputation. I should make the most out of this opportunity. I'll take them to task. I, Pindi Thathaji, who is conscientious without any fear and favour, am permanently banishing the nuisance gang Waltair Kings from this decent colony. "In the roads of the city, the air is getting jammed" "In the roads of the city, the air is getting jammed" "She had water," "But why is that she doesn't have feelings for me?" "She had water," "But why is that she doesn't have feelings for me?" "There is neither water nor palm wine" "There is neither water nor palm wine" "At the coal market, there's a new girl every day" "At the coal market, there's a new girl every day" "Whoa! Come on" "Rock on" "Hey, thick moustache guy who planted mustard crop" "Hey, thick moustache guy who planted mustard crop" "On a bullock cart... On a bullock cart... On a bullock cart..." "How would you arrive on a bullock cart?" "How would you arrive on a bullock cart?" "Whoa! Come on" "When the hot girl cooks dry shrimp and raw mango gravy" "The old guys from the corner would instantly get up and arrive" I was told that we were banished from the colony. -Drive directly to Thathaji's house. -Slowly. I wonder if he is at his home or Kasturi's. -Hey Thathaji... -Come out. I dare you to come out of your house if you are inside your house. -Come out. -Come out, rascal. Just come out, Thathaji. All those fools who participated in the general body meeting, just comes out. Who is this? We are the husbands of your granny! Why the hell did you banish us from this colony? We have decided that in the general body meeting. -I'll throw a stone on you, you bas... -Hey stop! Hey Janakiramayya! You went overboard in the general body meeting. Why don't you talk now? As if I was the only one. Hey Balaram, didn't you talk? Well, I dare such a daring guy to come forward. Ask him to talk. Who the hell is making nuisance arriving at midnight? I'll book a case. Ah Kaladhar! Are you booking cases too nowadays? I'll file a police case against you. I'll file a complaint against you to the collector. Why? Why? You've been torturing the children of this colony by making them like slaves in the name of Bharatanatyam dance. I'll file a case against you as per section 3001 A IPC, drag you to court and get you on the roads. Oh man! I won't mess with you. See you. Oh God! Why is this test for me? This is how one becomes if they aren't educated. What? Education? You have pressurized Mr Bhaskar Rao's daughter in the name of education. She jumped down from the building and died. Yes, she died. Damn! We'll be like this. If we lose our minds, we'll reveal the dirty secrets of each flat member. Be careful! Oh no! Will they divulge my secret? [engine starts] This is fully furnished flat. The owner lives in Dubai and I take care of responsibilities. Here are the keys. Advance amount please. How much amount? 14000 rupees. Add 2000 extra to that and give. Why? The rent amount is 14,000 rupees, right? PST. I have heard of GST. What's with PST? Pindi Thathaji Service Tax. I levy it for the development of the colony. Oh! Okay. Why have you come alone? You are there, right uncle? [singing] "Hey cutie girl with beautiful eyes" Bhanu, are you going to play cards? -Bugger off! -Did you grind the pulses? The woman is right outside. Why are you idle? Isn't he there? Bugger off, idiot! -Go... Go... -The woman got enraged. Wow! TV serial discussion meeting. They eagerly wait for husbands to go work. To hell with them! Oil massage! Bangkok oil massage! Massage! Nice shot! Madhu, go and get two cigarettes. Drive. Didn't you go to duty? -Sick leave. -Bugger off! Got a cigarette pack? NOTICE: NO CREDIT What? No credit? Do you have PayTM payment? Says no credit! Waltair kings present, free offer! Screenshot? Same shot, dude! [Telugu song playing] Go. The plate became empty. Fry masala liver in hot oil. -Go. -Prepare omelets as well. -It is 2 am. -We'll be here till 2 pm. -Go. -Will hit you! What's with your stare? Go! -Pindi Thathaji, my foot! -Go now! You are going overboard. He is staring! To hell with my life! Is the work going on? Yes, I am on it. [phone ringing] Kasturi, tell me. Isn't Chong there? Wait then... Hey, I'm bored of boozing at Thathaji's house. Next month, we shall go to Bangkok. We shall make him buy our air tickets as well. We should get multi-star massage without fail. Along with that, we shall go for a Russian massage as well. I'll land on your lap in ten minutes. It's hokum. Hokum! He is here. I just got a call from my village. My father-in-law got heart attack. He was admitted in KGH. I'll go immediately, console them and help them financially. -Bye. -Stop! What's his name? Sundaram Anjaneyulu. He once had a good life but now, he is in ruins. He had a good life and ruined but you are ruined and having a good life. Stop your Kasturi facade and get two omelets without omelets Go. Put your phone in the pocket. If I call Ching-Chong, you'll be in a soup if he arrives. Come on! He's got excitement but no show. -Hey! -Go now. Hey, what the hell are you talking? what the hell are you talking? How come you are disparaging me, the lion like colony president? Is it? Then, we shall reveal the true colours of the lion. What? Are you threatening me? Are you threatening me? Damn! Damn! Hey... Since I've been roaming around in a wig without letting anyone know about it, you've been blackmailing me for three years, using me as an office boy and made me as a pink guy. What the hell will you tell? Tell them whatever you want! Hey, I'll go to each house distributing Prasada and tell them that I have been to Simhachalam and tonsured my head for the welfare of the colony. What will you do? What the hell will you do? President, come out. Yes, coming. I'll crush you! Who the hell will recognize him without a wig? -What? -Who are you? Where is the president? I'll call the president. Be here. One moment. Where is my wig? Here. Where is my moustache? What happened to my volunteer post? I'll talk to the MLA in the morning. Who was that baldie? That baldie is my brother. -Didn't you say tonsure? -Didn't you say lion? Didn't you say distribution of Prasada to each house? There is a full bottle of booze in the refrigerator. Liver fry is on the pan. I'll get it. Enjoy. [crow caws] [singing Hindi song] Thank God! Sir is alone. Sir, good morning. Come, Manikyam. Be seated. I can't sit in front of you, sir. I have finished the investigation of the case. This was a murder... Well... before everyone thought that she was pressurized for marks... Suddenly, she slipped and fell from the building. Here is the file. Good. Sir, the pressure in her mind not showing up in the autopsy report is a huge benefit. But the girl's father insisted on filing a police case. But I have closed the file in my style by writing that she slipped and fell. It's costed a little higher to manage everyone. Don't stare like that, sir. As the education cost in your college has increased, our expenses too increased. Giri... Sir. Send him by giving him amount. See you, sir. Farewell. Are you new here? Nice saree, madam. I too sell sarees. I sell them in the form of installments. -The new stock has arrived. -Okay. This is my house. -Okay. -Come at your leisure. -Greetings, dear. -Yes, uncle. See, how the women in our colony got developed. This is B-block. Ms Sarala in the upstairs gives loans by taking Martingales. Come, dear. Come, dear. This is very important street. She is Kasturi. Home delivery of home made foods is her speciality. Her husband Ching Chong sells Jalebis at Jagadamba centre. They are ideal couple. Okay, madam. -Look there. -Give a cigarette. Give me a smoke. Varalakshmi, you are doing great. You'd tell that you'd come here to stay for two days during the festival. But you stay here from Pongal festival till Mahasivaratri festival. Get up once. Us? -Get up, guys. -What if we get up? Turn around and look. What's there? How come it got eroded? You've been sitting there since I attained my puberty. That cement got eroded but there's been no change in you guys. She didn't change even after her marriage. Give me a smoke. Hey, there is a new chick in this colony. This colony is small scale industrial area. My aim is to bring progress among women. That's why people call me feminist. Thought I am the president of this colony, people respect me as if I am the president of India. Why go that far? Mr Karunakar, it's been a long time that we had coffee together. -Come, let's have coffee. -Bugger off! -Greetings, Mr President. -Greetings, Mr President. -Welcome, sir. -Coming, sir. -Welcome, sir. -Have coffee with us. -Please sit. -Sit with your legs crossed. No problem. Hey, give your resumes to me. I've been looking to recruit volunteers from our colony. I'll ensure that you get those posts. Progress in life. -Go to each house and get their works done -Psst. I'll ensure that your salary gets credited to your bank account every month. Pour more oil and massage his hair. I'll get you a job where you need to go to every house and sell snacks. Progress in life. Get these jobs. Hey... Hey... Get the massage, sir. -Your brain got heated. What's this? Keep pouring oil. Keep pouring. Hey! How come you pour oil on my head on Monday? Monday is apt for this hair style, sir. That's because, you have been thinking a lot about us. -I have removed the colony volunteer posts -Mr President... Wait... Don't go. [in unison] Take care, Mr Thathaji. This way, madam. Come. [music mutes voice] Come, madam. This is your classroom. -Go, madam. -Okay. [children chattering] -[in unison] Good morning, teacher. -Good morning. Sit down. Thank you, teacher. -How are you all? -[in unison] Fine, teacher. I am Akshara, your physics teacher. Who is the topper of this class? It's me, teacher. I am Rahul. Good. Sit down. What about 'last'? -What's your name? -Gopi. Come here. Sit beside Rahul. Take Rahul as inspiration and study well. -Okay? -Okay, teacher. Why are you dull? Nothing, teacher. Tell me. Are you having fever? No, I am scared. Scared? Why? The previous teacher pressurized me to study as I was scoring low marks. Will you do the same now? Tell me your favourite lesson. -Tell me. -Coalition theory. Now, you please take the class. Hmm. Start the class. In coalition theory, we have different types of coalitions. One is elastic. And other one is inelastic. And the third one is one dimensional collision. [music mutes voice] How are you feeling now? You shouldn't fear a teacher. A teacher is your courage. Shall we start the class? Sir... Hello sir... Excuse me. Hey... Hi. -Hi sir. -How are you Akshara? -I am good, sir. -How is your first day? The first day of the first class with students is always special. Nice! Thank you so much. Why thanks? For offering me job. Hey, come on! Shall I tell you something? It is very difficult to express the first happy feeling of the heart. Is it? For your experience and qualification, you deserve big, Ms Akshara. People who have done MSc Physics are doing good jobs. But how come you became a lecturer? I am very fond of teaching, sir. Doing any job secures only my future. If I become a good teacher, the lives of all my students will be secure. That's my happiness. I am really happy. You will become one of the top lecturers of this college. Thank you, sir. Shall we go for coffee? Sorry, sir. It's my library time. It's getting late. Anyway, I don't like having coffee in the cafeteria. Try sitting in a library. The book will give the thrill which coffee doesn't. I'll wait. -Okay. Bye, sir. -Bye. -Prepare an omelette without onions. -Hey Thathaji... Isn't cable connection working? Cable wires got severed. Then, go for the dish. Stop staring and prepare the mutton chops. Get to the work. When will I get rid of these sufferings, God? Not God, but I found the Goddess. The time has come to end my sufferings. I'll take these rascals to task. I'll give you a return gift. Dear Madhu. What? Come here, dear. Why? To check whether the meat is cooked or not. As if there would a taste for your cooking. You have added mango in the mutton, haven't you? I have to tell you something. Didn't you add mango? -Not that. -What then? What happened in the morning was... -Greetings -Uncle. Tell me, dear. There is the slim guy in a black T-shirt over there. What's his name? He is Madhu. He is a social worker who awakens awareness in every human. Is it? She's got 60 crores worth property. She came here to spend six months ordinarily. I swear on fire, the way she asked about means that she is in love with you. -His name is Suri. -Oh! He is made in Andhra student. Due to bad time, he got stuck in this colony. He's got the intellect equivalent to collector. He is a voracious reader. She's got 60 crores worth property. I am telling the truth. How do I seem to you? A fool? If I am lying, I will climb that tank and jump from there. Is it? Wait... Wait... He is Saarangi. He is like a cousin of Michael Jackson. He is a great dancer. When she is being around so ordinarily despite having so much property, is she a lady beggar? What does it mean? I meant, just like the hero in the movie Bicchagadu begged on roads. She's been in love with you because of this spark thinking. Listen to me carefully. Ensure the other two don't know about this. I want to go to a job from tomorrow. Yes. I too want to go to a job from tomorrow. I too will find a good job. I'll be having good time from now. "Hey parrot... beautiful damsel" "You stole the hearts of the guys" "Oh God! We lost our sleep" "She's sprayed a new intoxication better than booze" "Love has stung us" "There's the magic of the girl in the heart" "All the friendships turned upside down" "and friends have been tricking each other" "Oh Lord Ram! Oh Lord Ram! Oh Lord Ram!" "She's brought many hurdles" "Oh Lord Ram! Oh Lord Ram! Oh Lord Ram!" "This day and night hustle is inevitable" "No matter how many hairstyles we sport or raise our collars" "Will the glare of beautiful damsel touch me?" "No matter how much perfume we spray and follow her" "will her fragrance spread to us?" Hey Pindi, are you a human or an animal? You said she asked about me. I've been following her putting so many efforts, but she's not even looking at me. First, get to know her likes and dislikes. And call me later. She likes dance. She teaches at the college. I think she is very fond of education. GO TO YOUR CHILDHOOD SCHOOL IF POSSIBLE. She does good social service, Thathaji. Do as I say. Mwah! "In these lives as dark as a night" "is she going to lit full moonlight?" "Will that star come down by chance" "and touch these soiled people?" "Oh Lord Ram! Oh Lord Ram! Oh Lord Ram!" "She's brought many hurdles" "Oh Lord Ram! Oh Lord Ram! Oh Lord Ram!" "This day and night hustle is inevitable" -Today education has become... -Greetings, sir. Greetings. Greetings, sir. Please reduce my son's fees, sir. You live in a rented house? Yes, sir. What's the rent? Do something. Move to a house which has rent of 5000 rupees. 5000 rupees will be saved. -Get that and pay your son's fees. -Sir... What's that rush? What happened? Any problem? I need to go out quickly. If you don't mind, shall I drop you? Oh no! I have booked a cab. Ms Akshara, consider my car as cab. In the cab, you don't know who the driver is, but here you know him. Thanks. It's okay. All the best, Madhu. -HAVE BOOZE, ENJOY LIFE. -GO TO YOUR CHILDHOOD SCHOOL. HAVE BOOZE, ENJOY LIFE. Hey, have you got any sense? Seems like an educated guy? What's with that placard? What's wrong with my placard? What's wrong? Look at theirs. They are spreading good social awareness message. But you encourage to smoke and booze? Do you smoke and drink? If I hold a placard which to stop boozing and smoking, will you stop? I won't. Where do you stay? Seethammadhara Oh! There is a Balu wines shop in front of Four centre road. Of course, I buy booze in that shop every day. Wonderful! Uncle, there is a school beside that shop. Do you know that? Yes. My son studies there. Then, did you ever question about wine shop being 60 meters far from school instead of 100 meters? Look at me. Do you know how many schools and temples are around wine shops, in this city? Tell me. Don't you have the responsibility of questioning that as a citizen? When there is a disclaimer on the wine bottle that drinking damages liver, it will be ignored. When there is a disclaimer on the cigarette packet citing smoking kills, you will smoke it till the last puff. So I held this placard to teach a lesson to people like you. Decide yourself whether you are doing right or wrong. Go. Okay. Should I go to a wine shop or school? He spoiled my brain. The society is very bad, madam. -Damn! -Very good, sir. You explained him very well. No... No... It's my duty as a responsible citizen. There is a wine shop that ruins health, in every lane. But there is only one government school per village. This is proving that we give more importance to booze rather than education. People listen to nothing when they were told straight forwardly. Egoistic fellows! That's why I chose this method. Come on! As if she doesn't know me. Why don't you say you like me? [humming] Who is it? Greetings, Guru. Who is your Guru? -You. -Get lost! Forgive me, Guru. I behaved so badly on the other day as I didn't who you were. Not badly, you have atrociously. That's why Lord Nataraj came into dreams and chided me severely. The lord came into your dream? -Move aside. -Master... Master... Master... One minute. Please listen to me. Master. -Oh lord! Oh lord! -Master... Oh no! -Master... -What is this, Lord? I consider you as my world. But instead of coming into my dreams, how come you appeared in this worthless, useless and torturer's dream? -Stop it, master. -Yuck! I will light camphor on your tongue. What do you think I am? Listen to me first, master. The lord appeared in my dream last night and said, "Saarangi, I can't stay everywhere." "That's why I am embodied in the form of Kaladhar, "the resident of E-75 of your colony." -Is it? -Yes, my lord. The lord asked me to seek forgiveness from you, learn dance from you and make my life blessed. Would I deny after God himself said that? Shall we start the practice? Oh lord, he blessed me as you said. Saarangi, do the salutations to the Guru. I asked you to make salutations to Guru but you are mixing soda in whisky. Master, do you have the habit of drinking whisky? Damn! You dimwit! You shouldn't ask such questions. See, I will show how to do salutations to Guru. [dance notes] [dance notes] Okay, sir. Shall we see for which you will do Bharatanatyam? From Kamal Hassan's movie Sagara Sangamam... Stop it! Damn! Everyone dances for this very song only. Don't you any other song? Master, there is an energetic song. Shall I give classical touch and dance to that? [Telugu DJ folk song playing] Stop it, rascal! Stop it... Stop it... Sagara Sangamam's movie song is better than this. Go for that. [Telugu song playing] Oh, master! You changed into this seeing my dance? Hey disciple, you went outside the dance arena. Come quickly. I went into dance-trance and came out of the dance arena. -It's okay. -By the way, I am Sampangi Saarangi. -Oh! -Your name? Akshara. It is as traditional as classical dance notes. Is this your house? Yes. I came recently. -Okay. -Okay, madam. Well, your dance is superb! Hey Saarangi... Come quickly. We have to practice. Coming, master! Hmph! Ma'am... small doubt ma'am. Good morning, master. -The thing is... -I will clear it in the class. Okay? Come with me. You are acting like you don't know me. Who doesn't know? Oh! You are here, my pigeon. I have landed. Look at the book and read. How can I start here? What are you doing here? Are you looking into your mobiles? Have you got any sense? What's with them? Students and society are getting spoiled because of these mobiles. True, madam. I am Suri. I am a lecturer of this college just like you. Oh! Lecturers like us are very essential for students, parents and this college. I'll go to classroom. She is laughing as if she doesn't know me. I'll tell you later. I have to get up early in the morning and come to college. Check the expenditure of the entire material of the library. Be on that work. -Good morning, sir. -Good morning, -Ms Akshara -Tell me. Very interesting! What is it? I was worried when you said yesterday that you want to go out urgently. But you were holding a placard that states to donate to our childhood schools. We, who studied there, are doing good. But they remained stagnant. Helping those schools would benefit the students. And that's my small effort. It's time for my class. I'll leave. Greetings, minister. We'll leave, sir. Bhargav, come. I've seen your educational hub. Your college is in the top position among, the South Indian intermediate colleges. After the intermediate course, there's an educational hub at one place for every branch. The new educational empire. Well done! Every student in this educational hub scores a top rank. This hub determines what a student should read, how to read and for how many years. Every student who pays the fee will be given a seat. And they should certainly score a rank. If Lord Brahma writes everyone's fate in letters, I write my students fate with ranks. You should do me a favour. Yes, tell me. You should appoint four of my men in the next educational panel. Hey! Give me some water. So far, the exam paper leak, And making it a nuisance. We shouldn't face such difficulties. The only solution to it is, I will set the question paper from now. My men will final it. All you have to do is to sign on it. So, it's like you want the print out of the question paper, even before it is prepared. Give me water, man! You are saying that you'd graduates weak students. I just heard that your student committed suicide by jumping off the building. Buildings will collapse if students graduate from your college. Graduated doctors would kill the patients. Which means, many of them would die because of you. Sir, what is your qualification? Does your qualification even match the ministerial position you are enjoying? Minister sir, you want the position. And that position needs my money. My men should be in your panel. [musical notes] What didn't she turn up yet? Oh, is this why you are learning dance? Wait, I'll teach you a lesson, idiot! I'll break your bones! Hold on! You are finished with today's class. You may leave now. Dear Akshara. Come, dear. I know that you are coming for me. Hello, Master. Hello, Akshara. Are you fine, dear? -I'm good. -Did you go to college? Yes. Master, you might be tired. Would you have some juice? -Okay. -It's okay. Do you know him? He is Saarangi, my student. -You know me, right? -Yeah. -You've appreciated my dance last day. -Shall I tell you something? Dance competitions for the gold medals are held every year, at the Konark dance festival. I've decided to send Saarangi to that competition this year. Is it, Master? -Master? -Congrats. Bloody idiot! -Master. -Yeah. I'll achieve that gold medal and hang it on the wall of your house. Trust me. It's not an easy task. Many of them would compete each other to win there. You should practise to win over them. What do you want me to do, Master? I'll be in your custody all the time. -Is it? -I'll achieve that gold medal. Okay, move aside. -Dear. -Dear. -Dear. -Dear. Master, what is this plate? He might wash my feet. Get on it. Why is this, Master? Akshara should see your performance, right? Come on, Master. -I'll bring the gold medal, right? -Hey! I'm on it. What is this? Should I wash your feet and sprinkle that water on my head? Keep it on the edge. Keep it properly. Dear, Saarangi will dance now. You should watch it, right? -Go and sit there. -Okay, Master. Master gave me an opportunity, -to dance in front of you. -Dear, bring those. What's that? You can see it. She is watching you. Come on, dance. [music] [musical notations] What's this? It's musical notations, man! -Master, how did I dance? -You danced really well. I'm so happy and you'd definitely receive the gold medal. My dear boy! Idiot! Oh! Is it paining? No. Not many students get a chance to fulfil their Master's wish. I got that opportunity. Well said. You'd definitely achieve it. All the best. [inaudible] Under the leadership of Ashok Tripathi, the higher education officers raided the prominent educational institution Vidya Vidhan this noon. The college is being run against the government regulations. As they are conducting additional classes and evading the taxes... The college buildings are illegal. They don't even have the fire safety facilities. They are maintaining the classrooms with students beyond the limits. The investigation revealed that the college was home to several irregularities Higher Education Officer Ashok Tripathi said that, a report on the full details would be prepared and submitted, to the government and appropriate action would be taken. This is something you should take care of. This is not something you have done. I'm being set up! You have to understand this. Thank you. Who did this? Sister, please give me another plant. This is for you. -Okay? -Thank you. -Hi. -Hi. How come you are here? You seem to be with a new concept every day. I came to see today's concept. Oh! Today is environmental day, right? If we teach children to plant from now, they will be become accountable and responsible in the future. Hey! "I've set my eyes as guard" "Is your name a country of love?" "I've opened the doors to my heart" "How beautiful is your love?" "My lips called your name like a song when moved" "When my step ceases, it become the abode of your love" "Like a bee in the flower of your hair" "You've turned me like you" Hi, Ms Akshara. Hi, how come you are here. I'm counting the waves. 874. But why? Many of them are dying by getting stuck in the waves. I'm preparing a thesis on how to control it. -Hi. -I brought a small gift for you. -The environment of research. -Thank you. Yeah! Yahoo! Ms Akshara. This laughing Budda is for you. "As our stained feet touch the ground" "The path turned into flowers" "Even if you talk a few words" "The sweet arrows hit my heart" "Your waist is like the crescent of the moon" "Your walk is like a swan on an island" Where are you? Ola cab is waiting for you. I'm coming. "Your moves..." "By scattering them in the heart" "To my dreams" "Please be reachable to me" "Please be reachable to me" -Thank you. -It's okay. Where are you parents? What do your parents do? You know that they are dead. But I don't even know where they are. Come. In today's horrific road accident on the national highway, the higher educational official Ashok Tripathi died. Police collected the evidence and are investigating the case. -Hi. -Hello, tell me. I have to talk about two things tomorrow. Tomorrow? Tomorrow is a very important day for me. Okay. -Thank you. -Bye. Hey! It's been a long time since we all are boozing together. I'm very happy. It's been a long time after we turned responsible. Hey! I remembered something. How's your job? Everyday is a variation and a betterment. -That is... It's good. -Hey! There is a great change in him. Hey! How's your job going on? It's like dancing on the flowers. -[musical notations] -Oh! Hey! Ask me about my job. How's it? It's a marketing role, right? I should be behind them. It's great with new feelings and with new pleasures. Hey! Tomorrow is a very important day for me. Hey! Tomorrow is a very important day for me as well. It's same for me as well. Wow! -It's an important day. -It's an important day. It's an important day. Which is why, we are the best friends. In unison: Cheers! -Hi. -Hi. Sorry. Am I late? How come she ignored and went away despite hand waiving? -By the way, who is he? -Damn! By the way, who are you? [screams] Hey, how come you are here? Come here. -How come you are here? -You too? You said today is an important day. Is it this? -Sir, ice-cream. -Stop! We can buy it later. What is written there? -I love you, Akshara. -Akshara! Yes, I am in love with Akshara. You said it is an important day. But you are roaming at the beach holding a rose. -What's with you? -I am in deep love with Akshara. Oh no! Damn! Is Akshara really necessary for you? Akshara is mine. Leave her. -Akshara is mine. -Akshara is mine. Hey, I am begging both of you. -Leave her to me. -Hey boys. What is this nuisance? Ask the girl who she likes among you. That's all. Ice-cream... The ice-cream seller was right. Yes, he is right. Let's go to the girl and decide. [music mutes voice] Where are we going now? I will tell you. You said that you want to tell me two things. What are they? Tell me. Let's go. Come in. This is my childhood school. No problem, come inside. Come... I'll show my classroom. Hey, slowly. This was my classroom. I saw you on the road when you were telling to aid the schools which we have studied. I felt that you reminded my responsibility towards my school. That's why I wanted to develop this school. Oh, really! What about second point? When I asked you about your first class, you said it was tough to say about the first day feel. But I didn't understand about it then. But now, I understand it. Though tough, I am telling it now by mustering courage. I hope that you won't reject the word of my heart. Who the hell is he? She should love no one except us three. She should either love you or you or you. She should only me. If she loves him, she won't love anyone of us. So, let's kill him. Let's kill him. We shall kill him. He will die today in my hands. [gunshots] [gunshot] [gunshot] "Sending shivers to demons, shattering evil plans" "Let the fire of education make it's heat felt" Vidya Vidhan's board director Sri Teja was killed brutally. This murder taking place at a school in Bheemili is notable. This case is given to a special officer Ajmal who solved many cases effortlessly and it was informed in an announcement by the Police Commissioner. [siren wailing] Sir, you came here in the name of special investigation. What are the measures that you are going to take? Sir... Sir... tell us. Tell us, sir. Sir... We are already investigating, right? What's with his hustle? I think he is a cinephile. Sir... These are the details of the dead person. Name: Sri Teja. Any girl would either hit or scold for proposing to her. But how come she shot him like that? Yes, what's with her killing? Well, who told you to go behind her? Is this our friendship? As if you have informed us and fell in love with her. Who have you informed and went behind her? Well... I eyed on 60 crores worth properties. I wanted to love her, marry her and then take good care of both of you. 60 crores? -Yes, 60 crores. -60 crores? Did Pindi told you guys just in the way, he told me? Does it mean, that he has shown us Baahubali movie? -Hey, call him. -Come on, do it. Call him. Hey Thathaji. Get him here. We'll take him to task. I'll take you task. -Hello Thathaji.-What is it? I want to propose to her tomorrow. I am little scared. I want to tell my two friends to gather courage. Is it necessary now to tell that girl and your two friends? Well... She's been liking me a lot. First, I wanted to tell my friends and then propose to her. Where are you? I am coming there. Come. [humming] [humming] Hey... Hey... Saarangi. Have you got any sense? What are you talking, huh? You have come, Thathaji? My foot! If I hit you with an oar, your head will smash. Why do you want to tell your idiot friends about the girl? -Idiot friends? -No! Why so hurry? Enjoy and experience love. Else, you'll miss 60 crores worth properties. You said 60 crores belong to me, didn't you? Bloody fool! Tell me, bloody rascal. If you give 60 crores to them, will you give your hair to me? Let's sit over coffee and talk. Generally, people would be buried in a pit after death. What's this? Hey tinker, you have trapped three of us with the same girl for torturing you? Bloody fool! -Let's kill him. -Hey! He'll be washed away in the waves. Let's leave. Hey Waltair Kings, wait. What? What is it? Is it my mistake to make you aimless guys into family men? What went wrong now? Three of you come to an agreement and decide who wants to be a millionaire. -Oh my Godzilla! -Oh God! Madhu, tell this baldie the actual matter. [gunshot] Oh man! Tell us, Thathaji... Who among us is a millionaire? Hey, I have helped you thinking that love means three conversations and four texts. I didn't expect that it would turn like this. -Hey! -You! Where did you go with the girl last Sunday? To the restaurant. The restaurant CCTV footage has you with that girl. You got trapped. Suri Babu. You said you gave a book to that girl. Oh that? A book named 'The environment of trees'-- Stop! You didn't even pass the matriculation. Why did you choose such a big book? Will we get trapped just for giving a book? You won't get trapped for giving a book. You have signed that book saying 'With love - Suri Babu'. Thank God! I am not trapped in any way. Because I gave her a laughing Buddha bust. I didn't sign on it as well. But I have the bill for that gift. And that bill has her name on it. Dear friends. As the colony president, I could change your getup but not your fates. Because you got involved in this crime involuntarily. Three of us got trapped. I just realized that you too got trapped. -Me? -Yes. How? You were the one who gave the house for rent to her online. Nicely trapped! Oh my Gawd! [siren wailing] [tyres screech] Sir. Come, sir. They claim that it was the work of the professional. Sir... Give your gun. Sir. -Give your gun. -Oh! Despite aiming point-blank, the bullet hit on the right side. It means he is definitely not a professional. -Right? -Yes, sir. But, since he couldn't hold the gun properly... May be he physically weak. Another point is that, he shot so confidently that too at close range, it means, there should be some close relationship between shooter and him. Or the shooter is mentally very very strong. -Doctor. -Sir. Start the post-mortem. I inquired at the crime scene place. We found no evidence. I have even inquired in his college. Everyone claims that he is good-natured, sir. He's got no disputes with anyone. Okay. All his details should be on my table within one hour. -Oh! Okay, sir. -Okay. Phew! Thank you, sir. It's not the life that is lost, but my crores of income, Sri Teja. Sorry, sir. We have pressurized a bit since exams are nearing. This percentage might be helpful in getting a college rank but not a state rank. You have to prove our faith in you in your next exams for sure. Otherwise, the 5 lakh rupees which we have sponsored to you would be paid back to us by your father. Decide about it. If we set an easy question paper for the next week's exams, all the students would forget about this out of joy due to easy question paper. You don't feel sad as your friend has died. Akshara. What are you thinking being alone? The legs that sprint for the future would stop if they think about the past. If you get the thought of doing a mistake, wipe it off immediately. Anyhow, this fight is not something which you have started newly. This fight was born 10 years ago, in you. No one ever should face the injustice that happened to us on that day. Look at the ocean. Every rising wave wants to cross the shore. One day, it will become a huge tide and cross the shore. If you think it as a mistake, the waves of the revolution will remain as dreams. Fight against the welfare of our people is not selfishness, it is a war. Waging war for the welfare of everyone is not a crime, it is a sacrifice. In the war to destroy evil, ours is the first step. Before the enemy realizes, we should behead him, Akshara. Sir... I and the special officer have done the investigation. We have announced high-alert across the city. We have asked to detain any suspects from any suspicious places. We asked to close all the check-posts. That's a point blank shot. But still, the bullet went off the target. He might be some professional. He has intentionally targeted our guy. It wasn't Sri Teja he targeted, but me. Sir... Don't you understand the seriousness in this case? In my 15 years old education empire, Sri Teja is the only person who knows everything about this institution. Do you suspect anyone? If I do, you would have brought another post-mortem report ACP. Yes, sir. Anyhow, I am not thinking about the lost life. I am thinking about the file he has which was prepared by the officer. If it comes out, me and my education hub would be smashed. Sir... Catch him. I'll give you money that you have never seen. The details of the murderer should be known to me first, even before it reaches the department. Okay, sir. We found traces of unknown people at the murder site. Come and tell us exactly about what you have seen. I'll ensure that you get into no trouble. We'll keep your details anonymous. You know about me, right? I can even make mute people to speak. Come and tell us exactly about what you have seen. I'll ensure that you get a reward from the government. Damn! How long we will be undergoing this nervousness? Let's do something. Let's go to him and tell the truth. What are you talking? If you tell the truth, he will kill three of us. -Moreover, he is mental. -Hey... That's not the case. Listen to me. Let's plead him and tell the truth. Moreover, he says reward. We can go to Bangkok and enjoy. I'll call him right now. -No, Saarangi. Don't. -Wait! -Let him make the call. -Okay. Your wish. [dialing] Hello. -Is it ACP on the line?-Yes. Greetings, sir. I am highly respectable person of the society, -Pindi Thatha---Shut up! What's the time now? 2 am. I know. What's with phone call at this time? Well, I have to talk about an important matter -about recent incident-- -Shut up! Whatever you want to talk, come in the morning while I go for walking. Where sir? Thank you, sir. Thank you. You said reward, right? That's why I have called. I too will come to Bangkok. Hi Baby. Hey wait. Instead of lying, we shall tell him what exactly happened there. Don't you talk anything. If you mess this up, I'll break your head. -Highly respected person of the society. -Coffee, tea... Don't come up with such crap. Hey, but the reward money shall be equally distributed among four of us. You shouldn't break this word. -You too. -You too shouldn't break this word. Hey... Hey... Hey... Look, the commissioner is going. Hey, come... [overlap of voices] "Sending shivers to demons, shattering evil plans" "Let the fire of education make it's heat felt" "This is the time for the battle" "Even a pen wielded the sword and enter the war" No... No... No... Don't kill me. "Becoming the aggressive form of Goddess Kali that beheads demons" "She has got intense ferocity" They are speeding up but what's with your driving. Come on, speed up. Come on, accelerate. Come on, accelerate. Aren't your hands working? Speed up. Come... Come... How old is this vehicle? How old? Blood oldie! Run... Run... Run... Hey, I too am coming. [pants] Hey Madhu... Hey Madhu... Hey Madhu! [exclaims] What is it? All these days we thought she killed for proposing to her. But she is here to kill someone. Will she kill us too by any chance? [bawling] Stop your bawling. What happened? I am very scared. We have to plan something and severe our ties with that girl. -Yes. -I have an idea. -You! -Bloody Pindi! Things went this far because of you! Get off! ACP Manikyam was murdered at 6 am today at the light house area. Not just common people, but even the police department is startled with this. This place which is developing as a tourist spot has become a hub for murders. "When police who is supposed to protect people are getting murdered," "who will protect the public?" questions human organizations. Send it to post-mortem. [music mutes voice] Sri Teja. Vidya Vidhan college. [gunshot] ACP Manikyam's murder. First murder: Government school. Second murder: Crime tool. When you go to the profession you like, your education will give great confidence in achieving success. Is there any link between that school and the tool? Two people died. But is it just one person who killed them? How come the file that is supposed to be with the vigilance officer, showed up at the murder site? Sir, I got the file prepared by the officer. But officer was... [collision] Who gave the file? Who brought this here? Who will answer these questions? -Good afternoon, ma'am. -Good afternoon. -Go to your class. -Okay, ma'am. [music mutes voice] Sir, we heard that you found a file at the murder spot. Is there any link between this case and that file? -Tell me, sir. -Tell me, sir. What's that file? Excuse me, sir. Ajmal, special branch. I have to talk to you. Your college employee Sri Teja got murdered. What do you say about that? In my group of institutions, thousands of students are studying and hundreds of employees are working. If something happens to any of them, I'll be pained. But don't you want to know the person responsible for that pain? You are already investigating. True! Even in our department, a police officer named Manikyam got murdered. When I checked his call list, there were few calls that were made to you. What do you say about that? He came here and went regarding Sri Teja's case. So, you need not answer to the questions that I have asked you till now. But you must answer my next question. The report prepared by the education officer after raiding your college was found at the murder spot of the ACP. He died in an accident before submitting that to the government. How come the report that's supposed to be on a government's table, was found at the murder spot? Maybe, as the information in the file could be proved, it was you... What are you saying officer? Cool! I am not blaming you. Pchh! It might be the act of your unknown rivals. [scoffs] I don't have any rivals. Oh! Come on. You are into the educational sector. All other numbers will always be striving to attain the first place. I mean, like your ranks. By the way... the pattern of the murders suggests they were not paid killings. But looks like they were done by someone troubled. So be careful! The pattern of the murders suggests they were not paid killings. But looks like they were done by someone troubled. So be careful. Akshara! Listen to me carefully. Breaking News The mystery of twin murders committed on the sea shore is solved! [siren wailing] -How did you nab her, sir? -Is she the murderer, sir? Please answer me, sir! [foot steps approaching] Every one is assuming that I arrested you. [scoffs] But they don't know that it was you who surrendered. Why? You are sitting in an interrogation room instead of a classroom. Pchh! Ain't it so sad? Akshara. Nice name! Working as Physics lecturer in Vidya Vidhan College! [scoffs] Your name, your profession and the murders you did... ...pchh! They don't match at all. Sri Teja and ACP Manikyam. Your next target is chairman Sanjay Bhargav right? What is the plan behind your surrender? What are you planning? By observing the pattern of your murders... ...I could analyze. You have a strong pain in your heart. What is it? How are you connected to the persons killed? Do you know them earlier? Who else is in your team? [gasps] I could help you only if you speak out. You can trust me. My words must not be confined to this jail. The public must hear them. Can you help me? Akshara wants to reveal the truth in press meet. She wants to convey something. Let her speak. She too deserves a chance! Who is she? To know the reason for all the murders, let her speak. What's wrong with that? Our colony faces an insult! She admitted that she was the murderer! The girl wants to convey something. Let her do it! I am curious to find out why a teacher committed a murder. Nowadays it's common that persons who commit mistakes talk morals. Let Akshara speak! What's wrong with it? We must know the truth! Allow her to speak what she wants to. She wants to say something right? She said that she will reveal the facts. Let her reveal! If a teacher who teaches good things has committed a crime, she might have faced some injustice! She would reveal the same facts that she would reveal in the court of law. On receiving appeals from various sections of the state... seeking permission to Akshara to speak... ...state DGP allowed Akshara to raise her points. Akshara... the accused behind the twin murders... that took place in the city, works as physics lecturer in Vidya Vidhan College. Being in a responsible profession, tidn't you feel it's wrong to commit murders? Have you really committed these murders? If so, can you explain why? [camera clicks] What should a student learn from you as a teacher? Apart from parents, one who we remember throught our life... is the teacher who taught us education. Sir! Which teacher do you remember the most? It's my Maths teacher. Ramana Rao Sir! You sir? It's my Science teacher. Rama Devi Madam! What about you sir? It's my head master. Guntur Someswara Rao sir. Like each one of you, I too have a teacher in my life. Raghava Master! KONIDELA VILLAGE KURNOOL DISTRICT He teaches education in the right manner. Both of your daughters passed out with good grades. -Yes, sir. -Join them in Kurnool government college. Don't forget to. You too should join your children in government college. It will be helpful to their career. I hope you remember it. I will take leave. What's going on sir? Before attending exams, ... if children spend their time joyfully with their parents... ...they will perform well in their exams without any stress. Mom! Give it. -Take it! -Bye! -Take care! -Ok mom. Why does she need education, Lakshmi? Ask her to help you at work. Sister, she is a fatherless child. Tomorrow if anything happens to me, her education will help her earn. Hmm... There is only one month left for your examinations. Sir. You must follow some rules during this one month. Eat well. Sleep well. Keep playing now and then. You are a bright student! I needn't tell you. -Thank you sir. -Good luck. Let's go. Vidya Vidhan intermediate colleges are in the top in all districts of the state. For the first time we are opening a college in Rayalaseema region. Compared to other colleges, if my college has to earn more reputation in less time, first batch students must secure good grades. In this district, students are pursuing 10th standard across government and private schools. This is their merit list. Gather the students who pass out with best marks in coming examinations and make them join our college. Because, if one good ranker joins our college, All the other parents will comptete to join their children in same college. [applause] Congratulations! My dear state first rank holder. Thank you sir! On your great success, on behalf of our school, our staff and me, here is a small gift! "A pen is mightier than sword" sir! [laughs] You might have finished your exams, but your actual journey begins now. Sir! As you always do, continue studying with passion, instead of feeling it as burden. We wish you hearfully, to achieve all your goals in life. Thank you sir! -All the best! -Thank you sir. I should do this to ward the evil eyes off you. Do you know something? Everyone is talking that Lakshmi's daughter bagged the rank right? Yes. That's the reason I am doing this to you. Just split. [splits] My darling! [car doors open and close] -Greetings Madam! -Greetings! We are coming from Vidya Vidhan college. If you join your daughter in our college, chairman offered free education for her further studies. Raghava master is taking care of her education and college selection. -Well... our chairman sir... -Sir! You better have a word with Raghava Sir. Hmm... Let's move. Look Sir! Convey this to your chairman. Vimala will only join the governament college! -But Sir-- -Please don't come here to discuss this. Please leave! These people are pressurising the passed out students to join their college, sir. Sir! Previously we used to go to colleges in town for higher studies. Now it's good to see those colleges in our village. That too, our children getting higher studies will help them grow. Higher studies are good. But making debts and wasting our assets for that is not good. We are taking loans for crops, and mortgaging houses. Now these people are making us to take loans for our children's education. But they are discounting the fee. They are hiking a ten rupee product to 100 rupees... and are tricking us by selling it back for 50 rupees. For each and every penny they earn, they pledge you and your children. That is corporate system. Education is the primary right of every citizen in this country. Buying it with money is wrong! Mark my words! With in less time, these corporate colleges will grow in number rapidly. 'You can be an engineer or a doctor, only if you study in our college' And finally... They make you feel 'You can live only if you study in our college' With out our knowledge, they would drag us into competitive world. "You should study for 16 hours daily and must bag a rank" "Or else, you dont have a career." This is how they make up our minds. In this situation, parents will believe these colleges more than their children. And pay the fees pledging their heads. Finally, falling prey to stress... unable to bear the burden of education... your children will come to a situation where they want to end their lives. Is it necessary to see our children in such hard situations? We feel what you say is right, sir. But, our children too need better education. Is it so? Srinivas! Do you know this Srinivas? He is the son of tailor Venkat Rao in our Narsipally. He pursued his entire education in government school and college. He is a doctor now! Vimala, come here. She is the daughter of our Lakshmi. What do you want to achieve in future? I want to became a teacher and teach people sir. Look how good is her English? She says she wants to become a teacher in the future and teach kids. Even she studied in a government school. Even topped in the State in 10th standard. What can you say about it? Remember something. One who depends on land is a farmer, one who depends on education is a king. Listen to me. Join your children in government colleges. [scoffs] Parents get their children educated by taking loans. The kids study well working hard day and night. Parents think children will settle down soon, and kids think they ge good jobs... and they rejoice. But... the tiny gap there is between them. My business sits in there. In that case, would we take it easy if they refuse us? We did insist, sir. The girl's mother blindly follows what Raghava Master says. We met the master. Not just that, he is conducting meetings against our college with all the parents. Even the rest of the students have dropped. What's his name? -Raghava. -Raghava... -Namasthe. -Namasthe. My name is Sanjay Bhargav. I'm the Chairman of Vidya Vidhan college. I already told your people that Vimala would study only in a government college. What's in these government schools and colleges? If she studies in a high standard corporate college like ours... she would become an engineer or doctor in the future. [Raghava laughs] If engineers are made only in corporate colleges... don't forget that the first engineer of this nation... Mr. Mokshagundam Visweswaraiah was a government school student. [scoffs] Well. But what today's education needs is not history, but it's facilities! Do you know how hard we work for our students? AC bus, AC class, dining hall, Hi-fi lab... We won't let sunlight trouble them and not let the outer world disturb them. We cover the course you teach in an year in two months... and feed them the entire syllabus so that it runs in their mind and veins. [snaps fingers] We make sure they get a rank under all circumstances. When you are earning crores on the name of those ranks... the children whom you transform into machines are committing suicides... unable to cope up with the world. Education is the primary right of a human being. You aren't the only ones who commit the mistake of turning that right into money. Instead of controlling people like you... the leaders whom we elected but team up with you being corrupt are the culprits. Being government officers, they are ignoring government schools... ...and are turning them into ruins Are you giving all the sophisticated facilities you just specified for free? Aren't you extracting multiples of your investment as fee from the parents? Parents are confused seeing our schools ignored by the government... and are cheated by the colourful picture you give on the name of ranks... and are leading their children to you ruining their lives. Do you think parents are fools to do that? Falling walls, broken furniture and blackboards without a chalk to write on! Do you know why many girls don't join your government schools? [scoffs] Because of the unavailability of toilets. So that's your final achievement. We have been defamed without proper toilets. But you have just showcased those toilets... ...and built huge schools and colleges behind their picture... ...and are earning a fortune! Ah! How costly your toilets are! If rich people like you had responsibility over children and their future Some funds from everyone would make the schools of the entire nation better. Letting children enjoy their childhood instead of stressing them out with studies their lives would develop and so would the nation's future! The coming times need thousands of industries and lakhs of employees. It's not possible in such worthless rooms. When you keep roaming around on the name of Polio drops and voter awareness... how can you develop children? Just like we need an intelligent student, we also need a responsible teacher. You wait three months for a month's salary, but I have a great offer for you. I'll pay you a lakh per month. Join me. Forget about me, but I wouldn't even let Vimala join your college. Not just Vimala. I'll make sure no intelligent student around gets near to your college. [groans in pain] [groaning] Intelligent persons like you are only good to be mentioned in history and books... but not good to have a good future. I'll kill you and your ambition as well. [Raghava groans] -Pay SI Manikyam to manage this. -OK, sir. [siren wailing] -Make it fast. -Master! Why did you do this, lady? Would you kill him just because you both had a tiff? Ain't it wrong? He got your daughter educated well! -Why did you do this? -Not me, sir! Why did you kill him? I didn't! They say that he was paying you for your needs! -What man? -He did, sir! They are lying. I didn't take any. Just because he couldn't pay you a month, you kill him? -Oh no! -Lakshmi, get her. Get her into the vehicle. -Believe me, sir. -Come on... -Vimala... Vimala! -Move it. -Believe me, sir. I didn't do it. -Come now. [Vimala sobbing] Vimala! -Vimala! -Come. -Vimala! -Come now. -Mother! -Looking for Mother? I too liked my mother a lot! If you join the college I specify and get a good rank... I'll talk to the Honourable Judge and see that your mother is released. I too liked my mother a lot! OK then, I'll leave. -Believe me, I didn't kill him. -Get in now. What are you waiting for? Get her in. Sir, believe me. I didn't kill him. Vimala! Leave me, lady! [siren wailing] Mother! -Vimala! -[Vimala] Stop! Mother! Mother! [no voice] Mother! [music mutes voice] Raghava... Raghava... Get up... "Tears roll down" "All your hopes have shattered" "Tears roll down" "All your hopes have shattered" "All the smiles disappeared" "The sky has crashed and the land has split" "And the world has become empty" "All the venomous snakes surrounded you" "and have inflicted deadly bites" "You are the diamond born in the earth" "You have achieved great heights in academics like a queen" "Your education has become your curse this moment" "The world has gone mute after the sin committed" Your mother has sent you new clothes for the festival. Thank you, sir. Sir, when will my mother be back? Oh! I had a word with the chairman. He says you scored very low this time. If you study well and become the topper of the college, I'll talk to the judge for sure and get your mother out. Study well and become the topper of the college. Okay, sir. "Considering the school as a temple and like a mother's lap" "you have studied very hard" "Where did your mother go now?" "No one can quench your longing" "All the golden dreams are shattered" -EXTRA-MARITAL AFFAIR LED TO MURDER -"And ruined all the moral values" "You are the diamond born in the earth" "You have achieved great heights in academics like a queen" "Your education has become your curse this moment" Accept that you had extra-marital affair. Else, your daughter's life will be ruined. 'Get a first rank and your mother will be out.' VIDYA VIDHAN COLLEGE ACHIEVES TOP RANKS IN STATE LEVEL Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. We've achieved the first rank in state and our college became top institute as well. In every Mandal of this district, the branches of Vidya Vidhan college would open. Yes! Thank you. Sir, you said that you'd release my mother if I achieve rank. I want to see my mother. Please, sir. Vimala, you got me a rank. But I can't get your mother back. It's been many days since your mother died. Sir, please. Please show my mother to me. Don't say that. Please, sir. All that matters to me is your rank, not your emotions. Get out! -Please, sir. -Get out! Please, sir. I want to see my mother. I said get out. "Oh, education... are you a bug?" "You turned into a commodity in the market" "It is the bustle for ranks everywhere" "You have doused the lives of the innocent kids" "How long will this filth last?" "What can be done to demolish this evil-stance?" [weeps] Here, take them. No, sir. My mother and master died because of these. [scoffs] Not because of these. They died for these. You have to study well. Your education is not for you but to bring change in this system. Remember this. Take these books. "Becoming the play of the Goddess Kaali with gory-fire" "Unleash your anger at this demonic reign" "Oh pain, leave for now. Enough of your yearning" "Your ambition would support you and help you in your fight" The thing which can't be robbed from you is education alone. That is greater than the weapon of your enemy. That's the one which guides you forward and make you victorious. That's why your name is Akshara from today. [camera clicks] We admit that whatever happened to you is unfair. But how fair is killing someone? You are thinking to bring a change by taking someone's life. How much do you support this idea? Injustice has not happened to me, sir, but it happened to this society. And I am one among the society. That's it. All parents tell everyone that they have joined their kids... in prestigious schools and colleges. But did you ever think about how your kids are being suffocated in those colleges? TV: Because, your trust is on the fees which you have paid and on the colleges, but not on your children. That is why, every hour a student in this country... is committing suicide for not being able to withstand the pressure, but no use. If they don't even withstand this pressure, how can they become great in future? No great person has taken pressure in their life, sir. They took freedom. Bharat Ratna Mr. Abdul Kalam, who has made our country proud, has studied in a government school, sir. He isn't a top ranker, but he studied. Modern education is filled with pressure. That is why there is only one Mr. Abdul Kalam for this country. Because every other student is dying in their school phase. Rank... Rank... Rank... Why does a third standard student need an IIT foundation? Does a student who hasn't even studied his 10th standard... ...need EMCET, NEET courses? Corporate colleges are encashing the enthusiasm of the parents... and are transforming our children into corpses. Every student who is dead, feels that his life is worth less, than the rank he scored. Recently there was a news in your newspaper, do you know what was written by a girl in the suicide note? 'Dad, I am in a jail, not in a classroom.' While dying she said a good thing, sir. Huh! It's true... 'The classroom is a sacred place which takes the country forward...' 'It's not a jail.' The education which can't give a person freedom, or which can't teach values... or the education which isn't useful for the society, What's the use of it, sir? Do you mean that the government isn't giving enough value to government schools? Where there is value to government schools these days? Except to the lands on which they exist. Do you mean private schools and colleges should be shut down? I am not asking you to shut them down, sir. I am just saying to give them stress-free education. A ranker's photo just comes for a day on front page of the newspaper in a year. But photos of students dying because of stress that they couldn't get the rank, we can see them on the papers inside every day, sir. You are speaking for the rights of the students, don't you know that killing people is a lawful act? I know it sir. My path might be wrong, but the destination I reach is the future of lakhs of students. I am not going against coorporate colleges, nor against to the coorporate people, but to the coorporate system. I have a responsibility to correct a mistake if its happening. Because... I am a teacher. Whatever injustice anyone has faced, but what Akshra has done is illegal, so the court will impose an appropriate punishment. Special officer Ajmal said that he's going to take Akshara to court immediately. What have I done? I have made a big mistake. Did I give shelter to my enemies! I said get out! Knowingly I left the girl and unknowingly I left the old man without killing. I did a mistake. How can I escape from the repercussions? -We did a mistake, guys. -Yes, dude. We who always commit mistakes are feeling that we did a mistake... that means, we have made a big mistake guys. We thought a teacher who teaches lessons has killed, but we couldn't think why the literate hands grabbed a weapon man. In the same college when our colony girl died, we just went to offer condolences. We had food on the ceremony. But we couldn't heal her father's pain. We witnessed people who kill for wealth and the ones who kill for reputation, but I am seeing someone sacrificing her life for education for the first time. Guys, we lived cheating ourselves until now. At least let us live well from no on... The student unions of the both Telugu states have expressed anger Intellectuals demanded government to take action on the management immediately. As a symbol of injustice when a girl is reacting committing murders, we should understand where is this society going and what message it is giving. Once we had to stand in a line for admissions in schools and colleges. And now we have to stand in the line for paying fees. Whatever Akshara has told is right. The chairman who has done injustice to Akshara should be arrested. Crowd: Sanjay Bhargav should be arrested! Sanjay Bhargav should be arrested! Sanjay Bhargav should be arrested! Education is the greatest wealth ever. Action must be taken immediately on people who are turning education into business. We are paying all our hard-earned money as fees. Crowd: Sanjay Bhargav should be arrested! Sanjay Bhargav should be arrested! Nowadays, education has become way too expensive. Do you know how hard it has become to pay fees to our children? Don't force children in their education. Officials should arrest the people to get justice to Akshara. Crowd: Sanjay Bhargav should be arrested! Sanjay Bhargav should be arrested! Crowd: Sanjay should be arrested! A place of education is as sacred as a mother's lap. Don't turn them into business. Crowd: Sanjay Bhargav should be arrested! Sanjay Bhargav should be arrested! You boast about the ranks your colleges have bagged. But did your children join your colleges? Did they even bag a rank? Crowd: Sanjay Bhargav should be arrested! Sanjay Bhargav should be arrested! Minister sir, Chief Minister isn't responding to my calls at all. Please... Please you have to help me. Do whatever you can and get me out of this. Bhargav, you are already watching... how the situations are outside. [glass shatters] [indistinctive voices] As elections are ahead... My fans and supporter are also present in your students. -I am ready to pay whatever the price is. -I can't do anything. Crowd: Sanjay Bhargav should be arrested! Sanjay Bhargav should be arrested! Student unions are protesting to arrest people like Sanjay Bhargav, who are turning education into business. I have learnt things these days. But... But please, Minister sir, please. Only one time, please help me this one time. Bye! Minister sir? [angry crowd sloganeering] Students from the two Telugu states have started protests, against the policy of private educational institutions. The state government has passed orders to close... all the Vidya Vidhan colleges in the state immediately. No! [screams] Government has carefully examined the reports made by... the education vigilance officer Ashok Tripathi. The government passed orders to arrest Sanjay Bhargav immediately... based on the proofs that he killed Ashok Tripathi. [angry crowd sloganeering] Netizens showed immense support to Akshara People are trolling on social media to arrest Sanjay Bhargav immediately. -To the management of private colleges... -Sanjay Bhargav should be... -To the management of private colleges... -Sanjay Bhargav should be... -To the management of private colleges... -Sanjay Bhargav should be arrested. [pistol fires] [bullet shell clinks] Sanjay Bhargav who stressed students to commit suicide for the ranks, has committed suicide under the same pressure of public protests. Akshara, and Appaji who encouraged for committing murders, the court orders them to immediately send them to remand. The court directs the government to consider the suggestions... given by Akshara in the pressmeet I know how glorious a house would be if there is an educated person in that house. That is why I made my son to educate some people for free. But they haven't only killed my son, but they have killed the ambition who educates some people. There is one such person in every town sir. That is why I have prepared a weapon called Akshara. You became an IPS officer studying on a scholarship despite losing your parents... I thought I can find a solution to this problem only if I surrender to you.
