25.000 English from DVD-PAL RETAiL Self/less (2015) He's here. - Carl. - Martin. Mr. Hale, it's an honor. When I was a kid, I saved that Time magazine cover. 'The man who built New York'. - You're the reason I got into this business.- Sit please. And uh, congratulations on the downtown contract. Thank you, I didn't know the word was out yet. Hard to keep the word in on a 200 million dollar deal like that. I hear you lobbied Councilman Clark pretty hard. - Just a few steak dinners, that's all. - I'm not talking about the Kobe. - Look Martin... - You called the Hale Group a 'relic'. - I'm not sure if those were my exact words. - No, your exact words were... 'The old man won't be around for long'. At least that's how the Councilman remembers it. - You're getting the contract aren't you? - I don't want a contract. You think 200 million dollars means you arrived? What I want is to offer you a lesson. From an 'old man', - free of charge. - We've spoken with Simon and Cowen. - Between them, they control seven seats on your board.- And they support me. You've come to see the need for someone with the wisdom of experience. And someone who might remember that Councilman Clark's first campaign 30 years ago was bankrolled by Mr. Hale here. Try and appreciate the irony Mr. Baldwin. You say I'm the reason you get into this business? Now I'm the reason you're out. You son of a bitch. You're gonna be dead in a year. And then who gives a shit? He's wrong. I wont last six months, its metastasized, liver and lungs. This morning the oncologists was talking about hospice care. - I'm sorry. - Don't be. What you and Judith went through losing a child. That's a tragedy. An old man dying, I'm supposed to say, that's life. Still feels like a kick in the nuts. - You told Claire? - I haven't had a chance. Well, she won't return my calls. - Jesus Damian, if only she knew... - She has every reason to be angry. - Oh, peanuts. - I'll send... I'll send it back. Cancer's eating me alive, and I'm worried about allergies. Maybe I order a PB & J ? No. You know I wanted to tear all this down? - In the 70s replace it with condos. - And now? I couldn't if I tried. Mayor declared it a Landmark. Martin, you ever hear about something called 'shedding'? Shedding? You mean like a snake? Ah, it's nothing, forget about it. It's something I was reading about. Hi you've reached Claire, please leave a message. How many? Before me? Less than a dozen. Shedding is an exclusive endeavor. You mean expensive, Dr.Albright. Well, all of our clients are wealthy but that's not how they're chosen. We keep it to the great. The visionaries whose loss would be a blow to all of us. Simply put. We offer humanity's greatest minds. More time to fulfill their potential. If you think about it, your homes, your yacht, your jet. All custom-built by the worlds finest craftsmen, and so will your new body be as well. Genetically engineered for perfection, harvested to maturity so looks, athleticism, every detail of your new anatomy were designed to offer you the very best of the human experience. A reflex. It's alive? Only in the most basic sense, a bundle of organic tissue. But right now an empty vessel. If you can really do what you say then why the makeshift lab? I mean why all the secrecy? You're asking the wrong question. Oh, what's the right question? You built an empire from the ground up. Worked every day to... create something from nothing. Now, as you slip away, people will call your work your legacy. They'll insist that your buildings somehow make you immortal. What's your point? Do you feel immortal? Remember, we want everyone at the rally to be respectful. We're trying to win people over. Dad. Aren't you gonna introduce me? I'm sorry to show up like this. It's the only place I knew I could find you. Well, I'm kinda in the middle of something. Let's take a ride uptown to that place by Macy's. - You used to love their sundae's. - Yeah, when I was eight. Is something wrong? - You don't look well. - I'm fine. Now, please take a ride with me. Look, it's just a bad time, okay? - Maybe we can meet up later? - Not later. The revolution can wait, Claire. I don't get you. Months go by, years even. I'm at work, Dad. This isn't work. It's a bunch of children throwing a tantrum. Look, I didn't come here to do this again. - I came because I want to make things right. - What does that mean? - I know you're short on funds. - How... - Just take it. - You know, you can really be a manipulative asshole. Don't be a fool, Claire, I'm trying here... No, you're not. You're doing what you always do. Showing up on your terms, expecting your checkbook to solve everything. I'm talking about a future, where the age infirm can shed their prisons. A future where the faith of a healthy mind is not determined by the faith of a failing body. Okay. Oh my goodness. Albright. I don't... ...feel immortal. If we do this, there's no turning back. Your old life is over. You see someone from your past, you walk away. Is that clear, Mr. Hale? You have your conditions, I have mine. You get paid after the procedure. I maybe dying, but I'm not a fool. Settle your affairs and fly to New Orleans on Tuesday. Your death needs to be public Mr. Hale. Have lunch at Commanders. I recommend the chicory coffee. You've reached the residence of Martin and Judy. Please leave a message. Sorry to bother you at the ranch, Martin. You mind meeting me for lunch in New Orleans? Yeah, it's a three-point favorite and that just means a home field advantage for New Orleans. Well, you know we've seen these before when these... Are you going to stay? George wants you to. The Hale Group,without Hale. No. Thank you. Judith's been spending most of her time at the coast at the ranch. I think it's time for me to cash out, and join her full-time. I wish you could drive out. Come to the new place. If the maids would ever stop quitting, we might finally be ready for visitors. Damian, are you okay? You... What's the matter? - I... - What? Call 911! Damian! Damian! Do you have your epipen?! Do you have it with you? He can't breathe! - ETA five minutes. - Mr. Hale? Mr. Hale? The good news is you're not going into anaphylactic shock. You just feel like you are. The bad news is, your body needs to arrive DOA at Tulane Hospital in about 20 minutes. Open your mouth, please. Have all your fillings been removed? - Have all your metal fillings been removed, sir? - Yeah! The machine is a giant magnet. Any metal will disrupt the process. So you're sure you're not missing anything? Good. What's that? It's something to stop your heart. What?! I said, it's something to stop your heart. It didn't work. - It didn't work. - What's your name? It didn't work. What's your name? It's Damian. It's Damian. It will take a few days, but it gets easier. Has that new body smell. - Damian? - Yeah? - Are you all right? - Yes. Death has some side effects. Here. The paper of record. You can arrange a visit to the plot in a few months if it holds any significance. But by now... Get some rest if you can. Tomorrow's your first day of school. So, how are you feeling? Terrific. I have the physical dexterity of a toddler. 250 million well spent. A sense of humor. Good. It's important, actually, to... - fend off despair. - Is that why I'm only allowed plastic knives? Well, suicidal thoughts are not uncommon. Inhabiting a body the mind regards as alien can be pretty overwhelming. And what is that? Prozac? No, not exactly, no. The 'glitches' that you described to me. That's your mind adjusting to its new neural structure. You can expect occasional, mild hallucinations for the first year. - Jesus. - There's nothing to worry about. Think of it as the anti-rejection drug that you take after any transplant. - And what does rejection look like? - Well, migraine, nausea, disorientation. And then... - Well, death. - Oh. - Is that all? An irrelevant hypothetical. - One a day for the time being. - Hell yes. I was born on September 20th, 1980. Phoenix, Arizona. My parents, and my older sister were killed in a car crash. My parents, and my older sister were killed in a car crash when I was ten years old. I was home with a stomach ache because I'd snuck in the kitchen. I was born in September 20th 1980. I was born in September 20th, 1980. Phoenix, Arizona. My parents and my older sister were killed in a car crash. I was home with a stomach ache, because I snuck in the kitchen a whole tub of chocolate ice cream. I haven't eaten chocolate since. My uncle Frank raised me in Chicago. I went to Northwestern, where I majored in Computer Science. I never married. I have no children. I have never married. I have no children. My name is Edward Kidner. Edward Kidner. My name is... My name is Edward Kidner. What's this? This is a graduation present. I would like for the time being just until you catch your bearings. We've arranged a house and car for you. And placed the money that you put aside in a new bank account. - Not many in there, are there? - Seven. You'll get refills at our weekly meetings. No. A leash wasn't part of the deal. I'm sorry, I admit it's an inconvenience, but with so few undergoing the procedure every one of our patients is a learning process. It's just for now. All right? And how do I get in touch with you? You don't. I come to you. My privacy is very important to me for obvious reasons. Fair enough. I'll tell you what, in a couple of months, we can talk about wherever it is that you want to be relocated, all right? But in the meantime, why don't you just relax and have some fun? After all, at your age, I'd say you've earned it. What's up man? Where're you going? Great. Hey, NBA. You see any scouts watching? - Huh? I like to win. - Hoo. Come back, you'll be disappointed. - You're not from around here, are you? - How do you guess? The locals prefer sucking? I like that.That's funny. You'll get a local ass whooping. - I'm Anton. - Edward. How's the wrist? My kids could dish out more than that. - You got kids? - Yeah, buddy. Let me show you my beauties. Look at that, the oldest. She just turned seven. Well, they're cute at that age. Before they grow claws and sharp pointed teeth. - So what's your story, Eddy? - What do you mean? You know, you're new in town, catch some jazz, chase the ladies? No no no. I'm actually running a car pool about two blocks up there. - No shit? I'm just around the corner. - Yeah? No shit. Yeah, I'm right here. - Anton. It was nice meeting you. - Sure. Hey, I'm gonna take you out. Sort of like a little welcome to the neighborhood? I appreciate that, but you got kids at home. Yeah, but they live with their mother. I get to see them like once a month. You know how it is? You'd rather drink alone? No, I wouldn't. You're on. Thank you. - Are you in line? Thanks. - After you. Eddie. - What's going on? - How are you. I'm Edward. - Please meet Leah. - Leah, nice to meet you. - This is Andrea. - Andrea, pleasure. - Very nice taste in friends Anton. - Thank you very much. Now, what were we talking about? They were asking me what you do besides trying to play ball. Nothing. I'm retired. - How old are you? - I was born in September 20th, 1980. - in Phoenix, Arizona. - That's specific. Very specific. Actually, I started a company and then I sold it later. Are they giving some away in there? What's with the line? - I love this song. - I love this song. She's... She's incredible. - She's a guy, isn't she? - Yeah. - Are you ok? - I am... fine. I just haven't seen anything like that in my 52 years. You're weird. Where are you going? - Hello? - Hello, Claire? Yes, this is Claire. Hello? Who is this? Daddy. I see this little girl. She can't be more than five or six. And... Somehow I know that she's the daughter of this woman. Something's wrong. She's sick, and she's expecting me to help her. Well, you mentioned that you missed taking your medication. - Once. - Just one? Yes. Well, that would account for the intensity of your hallucination. Oh, no, this wasn't a hallucination. I knew her. Oh, yes, I understand that it might seem that way given your unresolved feelings for your own daughter, but... What you're experiencing is simply a confused composite of old memories fueled by your own, very real emotions. For example, this town with the water tower with the pumpkin painted on it. It's likely some place you've visited as a child. And this Latina woman. Well, a one-night stand long since forgotten. - How do you know she's Latina? - Hmm? I never said she was Latina. Here. What is this? Hawaii. A change of scenery. Yes, I'm afraid I've uh... kept you cooped up in here far too long and I'm sorry about that. But for the week that you're gone I'm doubling your dose of medication. Now you remember to take it and I assure you, these unpleasant episodes will soon be behind you. Alright? Alright. Heavenly Father, we thank you for the glorious hope and for the great consolation. In the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost. Morning, Mr. Kidner. May I? - Hey. - Hi, how can I help you? Change of plans. When is the next flight to St. Louis? St. Louis... Destination, 200 yards on the left. Destination, 100 yards on the left. Hello? Put it down and get out now. If you're looking for insurance money, you're not gonna find any. I don't want your money. What? I'm gonna turn around now. - Please don't move. - Please just take a deep breath. I'm gonna turn around, okay? Please try to relax, - take your finger off the trigger, okay? - Who are you? Please take your finger off the trigger. It's okay. It's okay. Hey. Oh my God. How is this possible? - Take a deep breath. - How is this possible? I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about. - Mark.Oh my God! - It's okay, just try to take a breath. - What... It's you. - It's all right. It's all right. - How is it possible? - I don't know. Hey, wait, are you expecting somebody? - Did you bring somebody back to the house with you? - No! - Did you bring anybody back? - No. - Mr. Kidner? - Wait... - Okay, ssh, quiet. - Hold on, Mark.What do you.. - Mr. Kidner? Mr. Kidner? Open the door please! Mr. Kidner. Can you open the door? Mr. Kidner, put your gun down. We're just here to help you. No... - Get your hands off me! Hands off me! - Calm down! - Hands off me! - Calm down! Eddie. Hey, it's okay man. Let him go. You work for Albright? I'm still your friend. Albright, me, we just want what's best for you. This woman thinks her husband's dead. - They told me the body was grown in the lab. - Why don't you sit down? Please. That was his choice. It was the only way to save his kid's life. - You gave them money? - Come on, man. The insurance wouldn't step up, so we took care of things. It was the only way to get the little girl back on her feet again. You shouldn't come here, Eddie. This doesn't concern you. Like hell it doesn't, this... You took a man's life. Hey! Nobody took anything. You're a businessman, right? You understand that. The kid, Anna, she's alive thanks to you. That's bullshit. I could've cut that guy a check. Really? But would you have? Eddie, I get that you're disappointed. You thought you were buying a new car, and it turns out, that it had a few miles on it. How could you be so glib like nothing happened? A few miles on it, huh? You know, that... The doc says, each patient is critical to the program. - Yeah, fuck him. - You don't exist without us. You took a leap without a net. Do you really believe that, Anton? - I warned you. - You know who I used to be? You like to win. You're gonna be very disappointed. There's a car outside, I suggest you get in it. The woman? She's not your problem. It will look like an accident. - You okay? - I need to take the medicine. Just relax, I'm gonna use the bathroom. That's enough. Hey, Gary? No! Put the gun down! - Put that down! Put that down. - He shot me! The Doc wants him alive, ok? Go to the front. Go on the front. Hey, Eddie. Eddie, I'm not gonna hurt you. Eddie? Don't shoot, man. Eddie, I'll put my gun down. I'm not trying to hurt you. I'm gonna come in. I'm coming in, it's just me. I'm gonna show you my hands, alright? Touching the knob. Look, look. Do not shoot. Eddie. Look. You didn't have to do that. We were on the same team. Shoot him! Give me that! Give me that gun! Light him up! Hey! Wake up, wake up! Damian! We gonna burn you! Burn them up! Come on. What? Mark, can you just stop. Wait. Where are you? Stop! - Madeline, not now. - Madeline? What happened to Maddie? I don't feel well, we gotta keep moving. But you were just dead. They told me you drowned. What happened? Mark, we need to call the police! No! No, no, police. I.. I made a deal for Anna. - Disappearing was part of it. - Why? In exchange for the money, I... I agreed to do things. Things only a dead man can get away with. - Okay? We gotta keep moving. - What? No, you bastard! - How can you do that? No, I thought you were dead! - Stop. Hey, Maddie! Hey! I didn't want you to have to make that choice. At least I don't think I did between your husband and or your daughter. Okay? You bastard. I thought you were dead. - Oh my God.Anna. - What? Anna's in school, Mark. Mark! I hope she's strong enough to blow them out. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Anna. Happy birthday to you. You can do it pumpkin. Do you make a wish, pumpkin? I wished for Daddy to teach me how to swim. You're not supposed to say. Now it won't come true! Hey, that's not nice. - Is that true? - No, pumpkin.Of course not. I will teach you as soon as you get better. Shit! Daddy! I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it. Mom was crying every night, and I told her not to worry. I told her you'd come back. I love you, Daddy. I love you too, pumpkin. Okay, hey. Time to go, c'mon. - Daddy... - Hey, get in here and spit it out. You don't talk to him with your mouth full. - Daddy? - What? Yes, sweety? - Do you like my hair? - What? Do you like my hair? They grew longer. - It's beautiful. - Fine. Go, get ready for bed. What's with all these nice clothes? They made me remove it. Listen, tomorrow morning, you and I and Anna. Is there a place that I can take you, a friend's house, or... If you think I'm letting my eyes off you? Mark! - What are you looking for? - Shit! - Mark! - Sorry. - Just tell me what's the matter. I just need a gulp of fresh air! Come on. This guy. I'm talking about a future, where the age infirm can shed their prisons. A future where the fate of a healthy mind... Son-of-a-bitch! This guy... ...failing body. Professor Jensen, do you really think that old people... This guy... Mark! Mark! - I'm fine. - You're on the ground. - I know. I'm fine... - Do you need a doctor? No. No. It's over. It's over. - What's over? - Nothing. Mark! Please, talk to me. What's going on? I'm sorry. So sorry. I know you don't have any reason to, but you have to trust me right now. Okay? Just... Where are we running to? We'll need to get medicine. But I've gotta make a stop in New Orleans. Daddy. Daddy? You... You need to go to the bathroom? No? Are you feeling sick? No. - Of course not. No why? - Then why are we going to the doctor? Is it for me again? No sweetie, it's not for you. We're going to see the doctor's wife. Daddy needs to talk to her. Are you okay? - Go back to sleep, alright? - Okay. - Mrs.Jensen will see you now. - Thank you. Upstairs. - Hi, Mrs.Jensen. I'm sorry to bother you... - Come in. - No. You're not. Please. - I am a student of your husband. Please. - You're a student. - I was, yeah. - A student. - Uh, Mrs Jensen, I'm um... I was wondering if I could get access to your husband's research. - I'm trying to follow up on that work. - That's wonderful. That's wonderful. You would follow up. - Because that's what I told them. I said follow up. - Of course. Follow up! But the university act like he never even existed. They... Put his research into boxes... Box? Boxed his research? Is that stored somewhere? Is it... Is there any... any way that I could maybe get to it? Did Francis ever tell you how we met? - No. - He was such a romantic. Now, you and the other one, you're both so handsome. He was another student. Well, I think he's a doctor now. He comes every Wednesday and brings my favorite butter scotch candy. His name is Albright. - Maybe I have some... - Mrs.Jensen. Hey. Mrs Jensen. Hey. Look at me. Do you know where I can find Albright? - No. - Please. Think. No. Of course not. But his number is right by the telephone. Phyllis. Boxed up all of his papers in such a hurry. Alright, Phyllis. I'll be right over. - Now Phyllis dear, what was all this... - Close the door. Did you hurt her? The wife? No. She's fine. Now close the door. I need pills. Enough to last. - You shouldn't have come here. - You shouldn't have lied to me. I gave you what you wanted. I never wanted others to suffer. I'm trying to ease suffering. Just think of all the great minds of this world has lost. Simply because their bodies were failing. Edison, Einstein, Steve Jobs... They asked what he could've accomplished with another 50 years on this planet. My wife... My wife was an incredibly kind and decent woman. And she could still be on my side, but thanks to the Alzheimer's, there's no mind left to salvage. And that's it? That's your bullshit paper-thin excuse? That's why you justify murder? How do you do justify taking the pills? What do you think they do? No? Stop taking the medication, and your mind fades into oblivion. Madeline can have her husband back. But keep going. Push on. And each dose that you take erases a little more of Mark. His army training, his instincts. After a year or so, they'll be gone forever. You never asked the right questions, Damian. What do you want to do now to have all the answers. Let's go to the lab. Hey, pop! - Easy. - Sshhh. Not here. Take him to the car. I need a word with Mrs.Jensen. Easy, friend. Come on. What's he doing here? - Pop the trunk. - Mark, is everything okay? Stop it. I said, stop it! Let him go! Damn it, Eddie! Anton? First time I take it for a spin, you get a scratch on it. - That takes weeks. - First one's the hardest. After a few sheddings, back on your feet in no time. - The pills, give me your pills. - You didn't even tell her. Shut up! - Why don't you ask your husband... - Shut up! when your daughter's birthday is? And when you two lovebirds... What is he talking about? - Mark, what's going on? - Come on. - Up here and pull over. - No. No. I said pull over! Get out. Stay here, pumpkin, okay? Daddy and mommy need a minute. Okay. So when's Anna's birthday? Can you answer that? The hotel where we got married? Anything?! What I'm about to tell you is, uh... is not gonna sound very reasonable. I was sick. I was a very sick man. I was dying. And I took part in a procedure that saved my life. I was told something else. I was told that it wasn't... - It took Mark. - Oh my God, no. I can't do this again. I don't know! Your husband's dead and I'm sorry. What do you mean you don't know? I didn't know. - How do you not know? - I had no idea. Mom? - Mom, are you okay? - I'm okay honey, alright? Daddy just forgot my birthday. Just wait in the car for me? - Can daddy come with me? - No! Alright. Look. Daddy's not feeling well, if you need anything you ask mommy, okay? Alright? You know what, why don't you go play in the horsie? So what? I mean what do I... I call you? - Who are you? - My name is Damian. I'm so sorry. - I want to help you. - You help me? Oh, really? - You want to help me? Huh? - Yes. Why don't you start off by bringing back my husband? Okay, because the only help that I need is to tell a 6 year old and explain to her that the man who looks and sounds like her father isn't! - How am I supposed to go through it all over again? - I don't know. I do know that if push me away you won't survive, they'll kill you both. You manipulative asshole. I know. I've heard that before. Look, if there's one thing that I understand in life, it's the bottom line. And these people, I know how they think. They built something. They won't let it go. They will spend whatever they need to or eliminate. Whomever they have to. They'll just keep coming. I'm not asking you to understand all this. But I am asking you to grab your daughter and get in the car. I could take you someplace. Safe, where you can start over. My friend has a plane and he can get us out of the country. There's an account in Geneva. It's untraceable, with more than enough money. And Anna? She can't know the truth. When it's over, I'm gonna disappear. You tell her whatever you want to. - Hello? - Mr.O'Neil? Yes? I have a message from Damian Hale. I think you'll wanna hear it. I saw him die with my own eyes. You saw what they wanted you to. And this woman, you're gonna tell me she's uh... My great-grandmother? She's just a friend, Martin. Somebody I need to help now. What you're claiming is simply impossible. You remember in New York when I asked you about shedding? What? I have never met you! Me, Damian. I don't know what kind of con you're running, but I'm not biting. That's it, I'm calling the police. Anna. - We need to go, pumpkin. - Judith, please put the telephone down. I starting to understand why your maids keep quitting. Where? Where did you get this? What is it? It was a deed to The first building we ever bought together. Do you remember that night we signed the papers? We went to Charlie's kitchen. There's a brunette sitting in the corner. I want to talk to her. She's been staring at me all night. But you stop me. You already closed one deal tonight. - Don't get greedy. - Don't get greedy. Turns out she's the dean's 17 year old daughter. How'd you know to put this aside? It's me, Martin. We never do anything without insurance. Damian. It's done. But it could take some time to gas up the plane, file a flight plan. Thank you, Martin. It's March 22nd. Mom's birthday. - Try to remember next time. - Yeah. You know, all this will be over soon this running around. And you can have a new house and... New school, newfriends... A new school uniform. Would you like that? Yeah? How's the water feel? About room temperature. Really? Room temperature. I never got around to teaching you, did I? - You left before I got better. - But you're feeling better now, aren't you? Want to come this way? You know how hard it is to swim with those on your feet? - There you go. - They make me look like a chicken. We're gonna kick hard. Kick hard. Kick hard. Look out Olympics And she's on her own. When did you start professionally whistling? When did you go on tour? Yes, you can. Kick, kick, kick, kick. I didn't go on tour. I was just walking to my room. I really wanted to know how to whistle. There you go, there you go! So then I started off like this. As fast as you can. That's good. Kicking me in the face. That'll do. How fast can you go? Watch out Michael Phelps. Go, go, go, go, go! You're not old yet.When you get old, that's when you get scared. And then it started like this. Go all the way. You can do it. Then I started like this. And you're whistling. I love you, Daddy. Slow down, okay. - Do you need help, baby? - I'm not a baby. - Are you okay? - Just... just let me listen to it. You... you okay? Well, you're not a bad kisser. Another way of saying mediocre. - That's not what I meant. - I know. I know. Come on, I just want to know who you were. I just need something. Anything. To remind me that you're not my husband. For starters, you should be thankful that I'm not your husband. - I wasn't much of a father either. - You had children? I do, I have one. I have a girl, Claire. And? When she was little, I wasn't around much. When she was big, I was never around. She turned out okay though. - She runs a non profit now. - That's something to be proud of. Depends who you ask. - Is she good at what she does? - She's great. She's really great. Did you ever tell her that? Do you know where you'll go? With Anna? I've never really been anywhere before. I mean, yeah, Mark and I used to fantasize about. - Hiding away in some Carribean island somewhere. - Sure. Turquoise water. Hello? - White sand beaches. - This money. You'll be able to do that. And then some. Yeah, I guess. I guess I just never imagined going without him. No. Imagine that. What is that? It's nothing. I'll be right back. Hello? Hello? - Where's Anna? - What's the matter? Is everything okay? Anna? Anna? Anna? Anna? Oh, man. I just pulled on inside the road. I'm winning. Yes! Who's this pumpkin? This is Tony. He lives here. Anna, it's time to go. Say goodbye to your friend. Come on. Let's go. - What's the matter? - It's Martin and Judith's son. - So? - He died two years ago. - Who died? - Nobody. Anna. Mommy? Mommy! Put the gun down, you'll hurt someone. Take Tony out to our room. - How much time do we have? - What? - How much time do we have? - You have to understand, - I owe them everything! - How much time do we have, Martin?! The minute you step off the property. They called an hour before you got here. - How can you do that to a child? - What? We saved his life. - You wouldn't have done the same for your daughter? - No. Not like that. One day, he won't even remember what he used to look like. - That he was ever sick to begin with. - What about the other family? - What other family? - Yeah, I didn't know. - How do you not know where a body comes from? - A lab! Genetically engineered. Grown in a test tube. That's somebody else's son up there, Martin. A son they thought they buried. No. Oh, God damn it. The garage. I can get to it from the inside? Okay. You're gonna take Anna. You're gonna head through the fields until you get to the highway. - And what are you going to do? - Are you listening to me? I'm gonna buy you some time. You got a car that I can use? Take the SUV, the windows are tinted. I'll take them through the woods, there's a path. I'll show you. What? Mark? Why do we trust him now? - We don't have a choice. Go! - What? Mark? There's a truck stop off 180. If you make it, we'll be there til midnight. Thank you. - Thank you. - Okay. They're heading your way. Got a visual. He's alone. There's no one in the car. I'll check the back of the house. - There's a car! - What? No! No Wait! Wait! Stop! - Mommy! Mommy! - No! No! No! Anna! Where are they, Martin? - I fell behind. - Where are they? She and the girl rushed ahead to flag down a ride and they ran right into them. - He'll kill them both. - It was over before I could do anything. - Why the hell did you let them go? - I'm so sorry. Are you okay? Albright's card. It could help you.That was you. - Wasn't it? - Yes. - Why? - I rode your coattails for forty years. I thought I was repaying you for the life you've given me. I should never have said it. Why did you ever say yes? So much for the wisdom of experience. Goddamn it. How hard are the seizures? Tony used to get those too. This should be enough to hold you over. Until when? I had the pills reverse engineered. - Jesus! - Judith was scared we'd run out. And I couldn't... I couldn't stand the idea of Albright having so much control over us. Aday and a half to Mexico. Afew grand for a pharma plant to make you 6 months supply. And you're home free. Damian. A new beginning. There's a little girl. She's the same age as Claire was when I moved out. We have no idea where Albright operates. Even if you wanted to. You'll never find them. 12 hours. No pills. No matter how bad it looks. I need to stay under. When Albright brought Mark to his facility, he brought him there to die. No reason to hide it. I do this. Maybe I get a glimpse of something, anything important. We're looking for an abandoned warehouse. - Really? - Yeah. You have any idea how many warehouses there are in New Orleans? Yeah. Well, but how many of them store Mardi Gras floats? You still have the boat? Leonard, where are you at? We need you inside man. Copy that. I'm heading inside right now. You should've seen him, when I first met him. He was torn to pieces in a Russian prison riot. I could've let him die, but I saved him, and I resurrected him three times since then, and each time he's more loyal. - More grateful. - Where are they? Well, we have a client that Madeline is a perfect match for, and the girl's organs will not be wasted. It was built to withstand 500,000 milligray of radiation. Quite bulletproof. You know, Damian, every medical advance has a cost. The choices that you're making and what you're doing, they don't make you a savior, you know that, right? It makes you a psychopath. I understand that you feel that way. You know, initially, I tried for years to grow the vessels, of course I did. But my failure held everything up. Eventually, I'll succeed and all this unpleasantness will be seen as nothing more than birth pangs. Now as you can see, we have prepped the body of a 40-year-old accountant for Anton, but it seems that Mark's comes hardwired with some very useful instincts. I'm sorry, Damian. I really am. But its about time that someone worthy made use of it. Please, don't struggle, as you can hear, Anton doesn't have much time. Clear! Hello. Can you hear me? Can you tell me your name? What's your name? Anton. How many children do you have? None. Just a couple of pictures I downloaded from the internet. Carry on. The woman, where is she? She's down the hall in storage. Good. - Give me your gun. - I don't think that's a good idea. I've had my legs torn off and I've been burned alive. Give me a gun. Come on, let's go. Daddy? Damian? - No! Please. - Hey, it's okay, it's okay. - It's okay, it's time to go. - Damian? - Yeah, come on. Who's Damian? Hey. I'm just a technician. Go. A little metal. You see, sometimes I do listen to doctor's orders. Well played. But... If you kill me, you commit suicide. Because without the full course of those pills, well you relapse, you relapse. And we both know who takes over. Don't we? You see I'm the only one with the answers, Damian. You need me. I'm the only one standing between you and oblivion. 25% Promazine. 30% Olanzapine, 15% of Trileptal. 15% of Valporic Acid, and 5% Phenobarbatol. Hey. Okay, guess what? You like boats? About half a mile down there, there's a boat waiting for you. White sandy beaches, and turquoise water await. Aren't you coming with us, Daddy? I don't think so, pumpkin. - Why? - Come here, baby. Why, Mommy? It's okay. Why isn't Dad coming? Are you still mad at him? He knows your birthday, Mommy. Ask him, ask him! If you're looking to volunteer, there's a signup sheet by the door. Thanks. Hello. I'm Ed Kidner, I was a friend of your father's. May I sit? Sure. I spent a lot of time with him. At the end, in particular. I know that you two, you weren't always close. If you can hear him talk about you, he was... Proud. I have something for you. It's just uh... I think he regretted not being around when you were growing up. He knows that he could never... make that right. Sometimes I think he made a mistake, thinking his checkbook could solve everything. This is a letter. Just some things that he should've said to you while he was alive. So read, um... Well, whenever. Whenever you like. Thank you. I should get back to work. Of course. You have important work to do. I should be going too. Claire, good luck. Hi, Mark. Welcome to the Caribbean. My name is Damian Hale, and I'm the guy who bought your body. Lots happened since you've been gone. And you're gonna find that out in time. I just want to thank you for these months that you've given me. I... haven't taken one of those in days. You've been going through with drawals on that bed. Behind you. Waiting. Waiting for you to take over. And I can already feel myself fading. And soon I'll be gone. Welcome back Mark. You take good care of Maddie and Anna. Damian? Mark? Yeah. Yeah. It's you? Yes? Anna! Daddy! runtime 01:52:17 DVD Subrip ? 14.04.2018
