-Good evening, everybody, and welcome to "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" On tonight's show Air Force One Wayne Brady, USS Missouri Greg Proops, Apollo 11 Colin Mochrie and Hot Air Balloon it's Ryan Stiles. And I'm Aisha Tyler! Let's make some stuff up! [ Cheering and applause ] Hello. Hello, everyone. Welcome to "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" the show where everything is made up, and the points don't matter. We've got a sensational show for you tonight, and we're going to get started right now with a game entitled "Questions." This is for all four of our performers in two pairs. Greg and Ryan are there. Colin and Wayne are here. They're going to come down and collect the box of stuff. Now the way that this game works is that Wayne and Greg are going to be in a scene, but they can only speak in questions, and I'll buzz when one of them makes a mistake. The person behind them is going to step in and take their place, but each time they come in they have to assume a different character according to whatever they're wearing on their round and shining heads. And the scene you'll be acting out, gentlemen, is entitled "Passions Erupt at a Reunion." Mm-hmm. Enjoy. -Can you guess where I've been the last 10 years? -Oh, do you remember me? -Oh, aren't you a troll? -Why would you say that? Don't you know words are hurtful? -Don't you know that labels disable? [ Laughter ] -That's deep. [ Buzzer, laughter ] -So where are all the chicks? [ Laughter ] -Are you the horny one? -Isn't it obvious? -Yes. [ Buzzer ] [ Laughter ] -Remember me? -From what? -Does the word Joanne Stromson ring a bell? [ Laughter ] [ Buzzer ] -Where are all the chicks? -Are you wondering whether the curtains match the drapes? Or the carpet or something? -You want to play duck, duck, goose? -You don't remember me, do you? -Stacy? -Does this ring a bell? [ Laughter ] -Weren't you in National Geographic? [ Laughter, buzzer ] -Do you still dream of me? -Will you call me master? -Would you like to make a wish? -You want to rub the bottle? -Is the bottle still as small as it was? [ Laughter ] Would you like me to make it bigger? -Only if... Would... [BLEEP] you! -[BLEEP] you! [ Buzzer ] [ Cheering and applause ] -Would you like to check my briefs? [ Buzzer ] Are you the life of the party? -Want to have a three-way? -With you and who? -Would you touch my bulb and see if it's hot? [ Laughter ] Really? [ Buzzer ] [ Cheering and applause ] -What? -Wow. -What? -And more dignified than ever, my friend. Points to all of you for doing some pretty impossible work there with incredible grace. -Have you been drinking? -Not yet. -Oh. -And now, my friends, we come to a game entitled "Moving People." This game is for Colin and Wayne who are going to improvise a scene with the help of some people from our studio audience, and let's get those people now! Shall we? I'm gonna get those people now. Who are they going to be? Oh, hi! Tell me your name. -Kayla. -Kayla, head down to the stage, Kayla. Who else? Who else wants to be the... Oh, my God. You've been nominated by these crazy people around you. What's your name? -Joyce. -Joyce. Come with me, Joyce. Kayla and Joyce. Kayla and Joyce. All right. Now, here is how this game works. Kayla, you're going to move Colin. Joyce, you're going to move Wayne. Now, when you want them to move forward you just tap on the back of their leg and they'll go forward. When you want to move them back tap on the front, they'll go backward, backward, backward. Now, remember they can only move when you move them, and you can only move one body part at a time. All right? So here we go. What I need from the audience now is something that there could be a global shortage of. [ Chatter ] Okay, I heard "water," and so that's what we're going to have in this scene. The planet is being affected by a shortage of water. Whenever you're ready take it away. -Doctor! Doctor! -Yes! -I'm coming. Doctor! Doctor! Over here but no -- Hello. -Hello! -Hi. Me! -Yes? -I'm coming to you. -All right. -I'm coming to you immediately. -I'm just cleaning my wall for no reason. -I'm going to run over to you so quick -- -What is it then? -Stop cleaning your wall! Stop cleaning your wall. Stop. Thank you for coming to me because I obviously wasn't coming to you fast enough. -What seems to be the problem? This seems to be an emergency. -You have to stop cleaning with water because we've run out of water! -Oh! The lack of water caused me to miss me covering my mouth in surprise. -You have to preserve. Even me, I'm pretending to be a teapot just so I can hold my own water. -Let's go out into the backyard. Follow me. -I'm going to follow you. -Run! -I'm going to use my legs. I'm going to move much faster. -I could move much faster if it wasn't for my giant testicles! [ Cheering and applause ] -At a time like this, it's a good thing you have giant testicles, more moisture. -All right. I thought if we dug down... -I'm a... I can find water. I'm a human-dowsing rod. -Where? -Look, it's right there. See? -Let me help you dig it up. -Ow, my face. You're putting dirt in my face. [ Muffled shouts ] -I just realized if I'm going to dig the ground, I should actually get closer to it. Hey! Look how I can bend. -Let me help you bend. -All right. Whatever you do, don't be distracted of the snapping of my tendons. All right. There's some water there! -Let me run over to my left and grab a bucket. -All right. -Let me grab a bucket. -I'm just going to test for wind. There's some coming from over there -- where I'm pointing. -Where? Where? Where? I should look to where? Where? Nope, the other wa-- Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope, I'll look the other way. I'll look where you're pointing. -There you go! [ Buzzer ] -Give it up for Kayla and Joyce, everybody. Kayla and Joyce! -Thank you. -Hey, everybody, there is more "Whose Line" coming at you right after this short break so don't move from where you're sitting. Stick around. -Welcome back to "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" and we're gonna keep things moving now with a game entitled "Song Style." This game is for Wayne accompanied by Laura Hall and Linda Taylor, and here to join them is our star guest so please welcome comedian, podcaster and host of "Talking Dead" and many other things the fantastic Mr. Chris Hardwick. -Yeah! [ Cheering and applause ] -Love you. -I love you too so much! -Chris! -Nice to see you! -Thank you, thank you. -You're a star! You're a star! -Look at me! -Your sweater says it all. You're a star. -So, Wayne, you're going to sing a song all about Chris, and you'll be singing in the style of fantasy metal. -So I'll... -It's like D&D style. Like Dungeons & Dragons style. -Yeah like Dungeons & Dragons. Those old rock songs where they... Yes. -There's only one nerd in the audience, "Hell yes!" Like, there's very... You're keeping it alive. You're keeping it alive for everyone, sir. -You actually look like the dude that you listen to fantasy rock. -Woo! -All right. So we're going to use you, Chris, and I want you to join in on the song as well. -Sure. -What's a job that has no fantasy to it, and it's your own job? You really feel that your job has no fantasy to it, but we're two nerds, and we're going to make it cool. The guy with the beard right th... -TV game host. -Substitute teacher. -Substitute teacher, okay. So we'll make it a magical, mystical substitute teacher. -And it's fantasy metal? -Yes. -All right. -So I can't wait to see what this sounds like.

Thank you for that, though. -Hi, Aisha. -All right, my friends. We're going to play a game now entitled "Scenes" -- ooh! "...from a Hat"! This is all four of our performers. Ryan, Colin there. Wayne and Greg are here. Before our show we asked our audience to write down scenes they'd like to see acted out by our performers. I've got those suggestions in this hat. I'm going to read them out, and we're going to see how many awesome things our gentlemen players can come up with. Here we go: "Unlikely Lines From Romance Novels." -My dear, it's impossible to... roll a 12. [ Laughter ] -Concealment! [ Buzzer ] -"The World's Worst Mating Calls." -Ooh, ooh, it's soft! [ Buzzer ] -Rash gone! [ Laughter ] [ Applause ] [ Buzzer ] -Ooh, I got eight kids. I need one more to get that money, ooh! [ Buzzer ] I got eight kids.

[ Buzzer ] -"Things You Shouldn't Do To Try And Impress Your Date." -I can get you seats right behind the cameras for "Whose Line." [ Laughter ] Right behind it, first row. -You can't see anything! -So, I was just released from jail. Was stabbed five times. -Wow. -I'm still here. -At the clinic, they said I had the most sperm they'd ever seen in one person. [ Laughter ] [ Buzzer ] -"Things Guaranteed To Kill The Mood In The Bedroom." -Clinic said I had the most sperm they'd ever seen in one person. [ Cheering and applause ] [ Buzzer ] [ Chuckling ] -Heard you, uh... had the most sperm they ever saw at that clinic. [ Laughter and applause ] -Where were you? I started without you. -Just saying. I got them eight babies. I need nine to make that money. [ Buzzer ] [ Cheering and applause ] -"Bad People To Be Marooned On A Desert Island With." -Hey, guys. So there's no water, no food but how about we play some improv games? Huh? Yeah! [ Humming, buzzer ] [ Cheering and applause ] -Hey, don't go anywhere. We'll be back with more "Whose Line" right after this. Stick around. -Hey, everybody. Welcome back to "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" and now we play a game entitled "Helping Hands." This game is for Ryan and Colin. It will also be for our star guest, so please give it up for podcaster, comedian and television star Mr. Chris Hardwick! [ Cheering and applause ] Yay! All right. Now, in this game Ryan and Chris are going to act out a situation, but Ryan cannot use his own arms. Colin is going to provide those for him, and here is the scene they'll be acting out: "Female College Student, Ryan, Has Prepared A Meal For The First Time to Try And Impress Her Date, The Captain Of The Football Team, Chris." -Woo! -Yeah, I see it! -Thank you for coming over, Jeremy. -Yeah, it's pretty great to be here. -I'm a little nervous... -You seem okay. -...because every girl in school wants to date you, and I'm surprised your here at my house to have dinner with me. -I'm a little surprised too. -Should we start with a little liqueur? -Sure, yeah.
