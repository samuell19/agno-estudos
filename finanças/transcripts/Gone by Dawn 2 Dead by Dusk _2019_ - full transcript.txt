You're supposed to come with me. She's waiting at the diner. She said you'd know the one. She's in town? She dropped me off. Said she couldn't come in on account of what happened here. She told you about that? Some. Enough. You said we were in trouble. What kind of trouble? She got a note this morning. Said they'd knew what she'd done and they wanted their money back. 900,000. 900. You sure? I saw the note. It was attached to this. Is that a cat. The office mascot. One of Allana's first patients when she opened the practice. A stray that was half starved to death. Now look at it. Starving would have been a lot better. Fuck. She figured anyone sick enough to do this was serious. So we got in the car and came as fast as we could. How did she know I'd be here? Your booking agency lists all their dancers and what clubs they're dancing at. I mean she tried calling, but... Sorry, I'm in an on again, off again relationship with my cellphone provider.

This doesn't feel like right. It went to shit. Big time. But I thought we were okay. From the note, I gather you stole some money. 900,000. Allana didn't wanna talk about it either. You know, she tried really hard to put that night behind her. Me too. I guess you wouldn't know it looking at me huh? Allana couldn't believe you'd come back here. Why did you? I needed the money. What happened to your share? I made some bad investments. Stocks? Men. That's all behind me now. Maggie. She must've run out. I'll get her to meet us at the diner. I'm just gonna grab a few things. Quickly. Please. Is this Maggie? We were connected after she helped us out. Just friends the first couple years and then I got into a jam with the latest Mr. Wrong and she helped me out again. One thing led to another. We've taken a page out of Allana's playbook. I'm just dancing while Maggie finishes school and then we're selling this place and moving somewhere warm. Maggie has family in Texas. Sounds nice. I'm just gonna grab my overnight bag. Okay. Roxy? Maggie! Roxy? Oh my god. Fuck. Roxy. Roxy, we have to go. They could be back any second. We need to go! We can't just... Roxy, no wait! It's a crime scene! You can't touch anything! Okay, we'll call the police, they'll know what to do next, but we need to go. Okay, now! Come on! I killed her. No. Who killed her? How the fuck would I know? That's it. I'm telling Allana I wanna go home. This is her problem. I don't wanna be involved. How did you get involved? Hm? Who are you! I work for Allana. As a vet assistant. I open mail every morning and this morning... Yeah, they killed your cat. And now they killed Maggie! That escalated quickly huh! But it doesn't explain what you're doing here! Allana thought that I might be in danger too. If they were watching the office, it's a small practice. Just me and her and... She thought that they might hurt me to get to her. But that's crazy. Right? Right! I don't know what's crazy anymore. Until we figure out who's behind this, we don't know who they might target. Wait here, I'll grab Allana and then we split. ♪ Tweedle-lee-deedle-lee-Dee ♪ ♪ Tweedle-lee-deedle-lee-Dee ♪ ♪ Tweedle-lee-deedle-lee-Dee ♪ ♪ Tweedle-lee-deedle-lee-Dee ♪ ♪ Tweedle-lee-deedle-lee-Dee ♪ ♪ Tweet tweet ♪ ♪ Tweet tweet ♪ ♪ He rocks in the tree-top all the day long ♪ ♪ Hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singin' his song ♪ ♪ All the little birds on Jay Bird Street ♪ Sit wherever you like, and I'll be right with you. ♪ Rockin' robin ♪ ♪ Tweet tweet tweet ♪ ♪ Rock, rock ♪ ♪ Rockin' robin ♪ ♪ Tweet, tweedle-lee-dee ♪ ♪ Blow, rockin' robin ♪ ♪ 'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight ♪ Hey, need a place to sit?

Call her! Okay! Tell her to meet us at the police station and it's too dangerous to meet here. It went straight to voicemail! Oh fuck! You don't think that they have her too do you? That settles it, we are going to the cops. You sure you wanna do this? Allana said she doesn't trust them. What choice do we have? What are you gonna tell them? They're gonna wanna know everything. Not a thing about that night. But it's all linked. You know it is. Just let me think. What's wrong? I changed my mind. You wanna tell me what that was all about? I changed my mind. That cop, I know him. So? He used to hang out at the club. He's a real piece of shit. Okay, and? The Sheriff used to work for these people. What if he wasn't the only one? Shit, you don't think. I don't know what to think, but maybe you had the right idea. Maybe we need to lay low until we figure this out. Okay, so where do we go now? I know a place. Can I help you? A room please. Just yourself? And a friend. I'll give you our best room. How many nights? Just tonight. Is it possible to get something in the back? As far from the road noise as possible. You want privacy. Gotcha. Just fill this out. The rate is 89 bucks a night. How will you be paying? I need to see some ID. Drivers license is fine. I'm gonna take a quick shower. Are you gonna be okay? Oh shit, of course you're not okay. Here. Come over here. I can't believe she's really gone. It's all my fault. No. It is. I got her involved. The way that Allana tells it, you didn't have a choice. No, there's always a choice. Shit, why didn't I warn her? When you warned me why didn't I call her! Roxy, she was probably already gone. Do you think she suffered? No. Where she was shot, she would have died instantly. Where she was shot, that's exactly where she shot Crystal. She shot? It's a message. It has to be. Someone knows. Someone knows. You got to be careful rockstar. I'm always careful, you know me. Won't even let 'em touch. That's not what I mean. Mags? In the tub Rox. It's Allana. Allana, thank God, where are you? Allana can't come to the phone right now. And if you ever wanna see her again, you'll listen carefully. What did you do to her? Which part of listen didn't you understand curly? I can send her back in a cardboard box if you'd rather. No! No, no, please! Please don't hurt her okay. We're listening. "We're?" Is Roxy Myers there with you? Yeah it's me you son of a bitch! You are not gonna get away with killing Maggie! I've gotten away with worse. Fuck you! I can see we've gotten off on the wrong foot. Maggie's accident in the tub was unfortunate. But now it's time to think about Allana. Poor, pretty, Allana. What do you want? Nothing unreasonable. We just want our money back. All 900,000. You think I have that kind of money? You must be crazy. I think you're a very resourceful girl. You'll think of something. Yeah, 50,000 lap dances. Pity you don't have time for that. I can only give you three days. I'll be in touch. Wait! I wasn't involved in any of this. I just want to go home. Think of yourself as collateral damage Ms. Stahl. What does that mean? It means Allana is estranged from her family, so, you're the closest thing to a loved one she has. We killed Maggie to ensure we had Roxy's attention. We'll kill you if Allana needs similar prodding. Or, we'll kill her and cut out the middle man. Not married to any one plan at this point. This is funny to you? Not at all. But if you don't enjoy your job, what do you have? I'll be in touch. He's gonna kill us. All of us! Sucks to be us. Are you serious? About as serious as he was. What was that call about? What do you mean? We have to presume he's been planning this for a while, right? Watching us. I guess. Then he's got to know that asking us for 900 grand is like asking a dog to drive a car. Unless you're secretly the heir to some fortune and work as a vets assistant for shits and giggles. I'm no heir. I can't, I have about 20,000 in the bank. The pads worth a couple hundred but it's in her name not mine and it'll go to her kids. She has kids? Three, all grown. Two in college in Texas. So if they were gonna kill one of us it should have been me! Then we have no choice but to go to the police Roxy. That is the one thing I'm sure we shouldn't do. Why not? Because he didn't warn us not to go to the cops. That's kidnapping 101. No cops, no marked bills. Okay, I'm not following. He didn't warn us not to call the cops because he doesn't care if we do. They someone on the inside. She hasn't been dead long. Who found her? Neighbor. Said the door was wide open. They hear the gunshot? No. Got a couple uniforms canvasing, but so far no one's heard anything. You figure the shooter used a silencer? Do you mean like a professional hit? Looks like it. Who is she? The apartment's owned by a Maggie Tucker. Part-time dancer, full-time student. That fucking club. Do ya think? Did she live alone? One roommate, female. We need to find her. Anyone call the coroner yet? Yeah, he's coming from Milwaukee. He'll be here in an hour. Let's go. Any luck? As usual, no one heard a thing. You get to every door? Pretty much. Hey, crime scene asshole! I know her. The victim? No, the other one. Roxy Myers. You asleep Roxy? Not so much. What are we gonna do? Every instinct is telling me to split town. But... But Allana's as good as dead if we do. She's good as dead either way. We can't get the money. You said so yourself. So let's forget about the money. This isn't about ransom, it's about revenge. Yeah. They definitely seem to have it out for you. I wasn't talking about them. They killed Maggie and they need to pay. You have an idea? Maybe. I need to go out, you want to come? I suppose. It's not like I was gonna be able to sleep anyways. You wanna tell me what we're doing here? For my plan to work, we're gonna need lawyers, guns, and money. Just like that Warren's Evans song. Who? Nevermind. You can always find one of them here.

Can you make sure we're not disturbed? Ain't nobody getting past me. You're gonna be your bad self. Well alright. Must be my lucky day! Even better, on the house. I just wanna ask a few questions. Ooh, I'm intrigued. Ever represent any drug dealers? Yeah, it's like half my practice. The other half is, you girls. Who controls the drugs here in Stracony? Depends on the drug. Coke. Coke. Yeah, coke comes in from Chicago. Through Milwaukee. Mafia? I did say Chicago didn't I? They must have someone local. Yeah. What's with this one, she's not even dancing. She's shy. Who runs things here in Stracony? Well, she's creeping me out. Ignore her. Hey, I'm not answering anymore questions until this one starts dancing. One dance won't kill you. Fucking kidding me. Yeah, and you know what, lose the jacket. What, are you expecting a blizzard to roll through here? You're the most covered up dancer I've ever seen. I'm not... Not even clocked in yet. We just got here for our shifts. Ah, and you couldn't wait to see your Uncle Stanley huh? That's right. You were saying? I was saying, she's still creeping me out. Have her turn around or something. Better? Much better. Okay, old man Mazzato, he's the top dog here in Stracony. Nothing comes in unless he knows about it. Mazzato? Vinnie Mazzato. But you don't wanna mess with him. It was his nephew that was whacked here about three years ago. Some say he orchestrated the whole thing. No proof of course. Why? - You looking to score? - I told you, There's no one here! Gotta go. You look as good going as coming. You better not be lying to me bitch. There's nothing back here. What's in this room? Roxy run! Son of a bitch! Out of the way bitch! Go! Roxy. Roxy stop. Roxy! What's wrong! She was shot Roxy. Shit, how bad? I don't know, but we need to get her to a hospital. No hospitals! She's right, hospitals ask questions. And that bastard might be waiting. Do you think you can patch her up? Me? You're a vet aren't you? Assistant Roxy! That trumps Alura and me! Oh fuck. You got anything for pain up there? There's some aspirin in the glove box. No aspirin. It's a blood thinner, you'll bleed faster. See, you do know what you're doing. Was hoping for something a little stronger anyway. Then we'll stop and get something. Jessie, what do you need to help her? An ambulance. This one's spunky. I can see why you like her. Jessie, you know what I mean. Okay, I suppose if we went to the office, I could extract the bullet and stitch her up. We had a Great Dane come in shot up a few weeks ago. So we go to Chicago. Hells no. If those guys knew to look for you at the club, how do you know they're not sitting on the office? I don't feel like getting shot again. You got a better idea? One vet's office is pretty much the same as all the others, right? Yeah. Except I only have keys to one office. Ours. Roxy. We're going to the vet and the liquor store and not in that order. What do you drink? I don't know. When I wanna get my dance on it's coolers, but when I've been shot and I wanna number the pain, I don't know, whiskey? Whiskey, got it. Hey cash. We have to assume they can track credit cards. Normally I don't like to pry but what the hell have you gotten yourself into? Those guys at the club weren't fucking around. How many were there? There were three. They kinda looked like brothers to me. Big bald bikers. Kinda reminded me of bears. The three bears. Yeah. The one we tussled with wasn't the biggest. So let's call that one mama bear. There's a papa bear and there was a baby bear too. Baby bear, he's been in the club before, but the other two, I've never seen 'em before. You said they were in Will's office. Do you think he called them? Nah, he doesn't want their kind in the club. I think he was scared of them. Will, he doesn't scare easily. Their kind? Mobsters. He's worked hard to clean that shit up since what happened to Stag. I'm sorry you got dragged into this. It's not your fault, his temper. He slammed me into the wall, called me bitch, and it was on. I wanted to knock that fucker out. I know that feeling. Shit, what is she doing? I told her no plastic! I think he's checking her ID. She looks about 12, you should of done it yourself. Hey, I still get asked for ID sometimes. She is old enough to buy booze right? 'Cause I can really use some right about now. Oh thank god. How did you know there wouldn't be an alarm? There's no security plaque. Roxy. Whoa! We're going for comfortably numb, not unconscious, okay. We still need you. So what's next? Assuming your little friend can put me back together. I don't know about you but I need some sleep. It's been a long day. Come on. Over here. Well this sucks. The sooner she starts the sooner she finishes. Are you sure you know what you're doing? Just let her take a look. If it's real bad we'll find a doctor. Okay, I'm just gonna pull your panties down and get a closer look. Just do what you got to do. How bad is it? Hold still. My ass is one of my best features you know. I hope you can save it. It's not that bad. Really? Really, it's just a flesh wound. The bullet? Back at the club. Went right through here and then out on the other side. I'm just gonna clean it up so it doesn't infect and then I can bandage it. Hear that? You're gonna be fine. You go on ahead, I'm gonna grab a quick smoke. Hey. Huh. I thought you were quitting? It's not as easy as it sounds. I'll just be a minute. Alright. It's too risky Rox. I left my bag in the room. It has my cash. You said they might be able to track your credit cards? Well Jessie put the room on her card. I'm sorry. I didn't know not to. It's okay, I'm not blaming you. I'm just pointing out the facts. I'll just be a minute. Shit! What is it? It's the three bears. The three bears? Now what? I can't drive around all night. I know a place where no one will find us. We can crash there, figure things out in the morning. What do you say Roxy? We could really use some sleep. Show us the way. Well, make yourselves at home. Whose place is this? A friends. He asked me to keep an eye on things when he's away. Oh, vacation? Prison. You're sure no one knows you're here? Does it look like I check up real regular? Okay, so I'm gonna take the master, and you two can fight it out over the other bedroom. But just keep it down. Flip a coin for it? I'm just gonna take the couch. You can have it. Oh, hey Rox, wake up! Ah, you just missed it. The welcome to Texas sign. We're here? Another nine hours. Texas is a big state. You want me to drive home? Nah nah, I'm good. You look like you needed the sleep. I had a dream about Allana. She decided to come to Texas with us. That's nice. I've barely spoken to her since you. I know. She's been so busy. First school and opening her practice. It's not just that. We reminded her of things that she didn't wanna be reminded of. She's put it all behind her. I'm really proud of her for that. I'm proud of you. Me? I didn't become a doctor. Oh. Allana's not a doctor Rox, she's a vet. Still, she did what she said. You know how many girls I've met who said they were saving money for college? Just a story we tell ourselves so we can feel better. Not Allana. She took the money and she used it for something good. Well, look around you Rox. We're doing it too. Hold your fucking horses! Randy! Relax, it's just one of Randy's idiot customers. You're sure? Yeah, put the gun down. Is that my fucking piece? Randy, open up man! What's the matter with you? People are trying to sleep here. Well where's Randy? And who are you? Nevermind who I am. Who are you and what the fuck do you want? Randy! Randy's not here. Well where is he? He told me to meet him here. He owes me money. I doubt that. Randy's been gone a couple of months. I've been gone a couple months. Jail? Rehab. Didn't take huh? What's it to you? Why all the questions? There's nothing here! Randy isn't that stupid. He sold his stash before he reported. Reported? What, did he join the fucking army? Prison. Where you're going if you don't get the hell out of here. You better put that down bitch! Or what? I was only playing. Don't go crazy. My friend asked you to leave, get out. Lots of places to score Max. Just not here, not for a while. Is he gonna go to the cops? Nah, I think we're good. But since we're up, what do ya say we make some breakfast and decide what we're gonna do next? Car trouble you suppose, in the middle of a field. Sitting right on the seat. Huh. Maybe they're hoping someone would steal it. Like an insurance scam or something. Maybe. Whoa. Jesus, is she, is she dead? Stone cold. Damn. I'll call it in. You don't like them? It's, it's a little dry. Hard to make buttermilk pancakes without butter and milk. I did my best. You said you had a plan Roxy? I do. But you won't like it. I don't like anything about this. I mean running, hiding, getting shot at. That was me remember? So if you have a plan to get Allana back and get the hell out of here, I'm listening. I'm kinda curious what I got myself into. This is a revenge plot. Plain and simple. Maggie, Allana, and I stole some money, along with another girl who double-crossed us, and somehow some very bad people have figured it out. So, how much we talking about? 900,000. Oh shit! Keep your panties on, the money's long gone. And they know it. So why are they still holding Allana for ransom then? Maybe to flush us out. I haven't figured that part yet. Or, maybe they've already killed her and we move on to part two of the plan. Get the fuck out of town. You can cut and run. Wouldn't blame you a bit, but I can't. I'll listen to your plan first. And then I'll cut and run. If we wanna get Allana back, we need leverage. They took one of ours, so we take one of theirs. You wanna kidnap one of the three bears? Are you crazy? No, the bears scare me. I want to kidnap their boss. You are crazy. Those guys are mob, and that means that their boss... Stanley told me there's some old man running things locally. You don't believe anything that ass clown says do you? Stanley represents half the scumbags in town. He must do a lot drug cases. Sure, we're sitting in one of his esteemed clients places right now. So who does he say runs things? Vinnie Mazzato. Old man Mazzato? Yeah, you know him? Yeah, you do too. You probably gave him like 100 lap dances. What? Biker looking dude, always sits in the front row, tips really well, never touches. Unlike some of the others. The Hell's Angel looking guy, that's Vinnie Mazzato? Do you suppose Stanley's right about him? How the hell would I know? I don't ask him about his business. Shit. What if we're wrong? What if we're right? This is a bad idea Rox. I need to be sure Vinnie's the one before we go through with it. Last time it didn't end so well. The longer we're out in the open, the better chance the bears have of finding us. This won't take long. Besides, she's a friend. Can I help you? Hey Shelby, it's been a long time. Roxy? Is that you? It is you! You look different. But beautiful as always.

Maybe some of these other girls might know where they'd go. No way, the other girls are off limits. The old man said so. Relax, we're not gonna damage the merchandise.

You'll get her back. But she may have to dance with a bag over her head for the first couple of weeks. That wasn't part of the deal. Look, we don't wanna do anything to hurt the club. That would be like cutting off our own nose. Why don't you give us some idea where to start looking, huh? We can be on our way. Who likes Roxy enough to shelter her from the shit storm that she has brought on herself? Roxy didn't have many friends. Except Allana and Crystal. There was one girl. Shelby Kyle. But she hasn't worked here in three years. She found the bodies with me. It scared her straight. But she's tight with Roxy? I wouldn't say tight, but they were friendly enough. Well that's a start. Now, this Shelby Kyle, where is she now? Last I heard, she bought a place in Appleton and got married. You got married? Two years ago next month. Belly button Rob. Robert. Just Robert. Of course. Congratulations. Thanks. Can I get you guys anything? Coffee? Tea? Me. Sorry to drop in on you but we really need your help. Of course, anything you guys need. You don't suppose we could borrow some clothes do you? You're in luck. I have two bags of clothes I'd been meaning to give to Goodwill. You're welcome to any of it. It's just inside the door in the guest room. Jessie, let's go try on some clothes and let the grownups talk. Roxy, are you in some sort of trouble? You could say that? What can I do? I just need some information. You were there that night three years ago. Yeah, I was there. The Wisconsin strip club massacre. Christ. You told the cops you saw Crystal. Well, technically it was Will who told them. I just backed him up. But I never said anything about you. Me? Come on Rox, I knew you were there with Crystal. I... How? I recognized your panties on Stag's doorknob. You recognized my panties? The purple ones. They stuck out because I remember thinking they looked good on you. I was gonna get a pair myself. You knew. But I didn't say anything. Not a word. After that night, I never went back. Do you think anyone else knew? Will maybe? If Will would have known, he would've told the police. But they were only interested in Crystal. What happened that night? Stag raped Allana. So we went to get even. No one was supposed to die. Crystal was crazy. She killed Cop and Vince. Stag raped Allana? Then he got what he deserved. We didn't mean to kill him. You didn't kill him Rox. He's doing a 10-year-sentence at Kettle. No, that's impossible. He bled like a stuck pig, but the paramedics found a pulse. Then they found like 10 pounds of coke hidden in the ceiling so he got sent up. Hey honey! Roxy. Is that you? You look different. Great I mean. Can you go put on some coffee? Five cups of coffee. It's really good seeing you again Roxy. So tell me, where'd you disappear to? Did a bit of travel. I needed the change. I hear that. Shelby and I are going to Vegas for our anniversary. Robert, do you mind giving us some privacy? Girl talk, you know. Right. Of course. I have a bunch of work I have to get back to anyways. It was great seeing you again and very nice meeting you ladies. If you need anything, just give me a holler. So, how'd you kids meet? How did you not know Stag was alive? It was all over the news. Allana and I didn't stick around. We drove for two days straight and caught a flight to Mexico. Wait, Stag is alive and Maggie didn't tell you? Maggie split town faster than we did. Hopped a flight to Europe. Allana moved to Chicago a few months later and I ended up in Philly. Okay, but you must have heard at least something in the club. I've barely been back a month. I clock in, I dance, I clock out. Dancers aren't nearly as social as you might think. You're back at the club Rox? Yup. The latest in a lifetime of bad decisions. It's obvious then. Stag is the one that's behind all of this. He has every reason to wanna hurt you and Allana. Why are guys so damned attached to their balls? I know right? But why wait three years? He's in max. Can't be easy to do anything in there. How could he snatch Allana if he's in max? That's what we have to find out. What can I do to help? You've done enough. Thank you for the clothes and the coffee. I wish I could do more. No, this is my mess. I'll clean it up. Can I ask you something? Robert says he never goes to the club. You haven't seen him have you? Not once. I'm sure he's never seen Alura before either and she's been there a year. Why would he go out for hamburger when he's got steak at home? Be careful Rox. Okay, what's next? I need to get inside and see Stag. That's crazy. Crazier I mean. Probably. Now I just need to find a way to get a message to him. Where's he doing his time? Kettle. Easy. Randy's doing his time there too. Want me to get him to pass on a little message? You're both crazy. Occupational hazard. Chris, nice to meet you. Jessie's right you know. Huh? Visiting the prison is crazy. At least we'll know. That's a high price to pay. Wait, you don't think Stag's behind it do you? No, but I think he'll know who is. Now what? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. Jesus, hold on. Who the fuck are you! What are you doing in Randy's place? Dog sitting. Randy doesn't have a dog bitch. Okay good, 'cause I thought I lost the little fucker. Ha, ha, I'm calling the cops. Oh, are you Randy's friend or something? I'm his girlfriend, who are you? I'm just his friend. He asked me to watch his place while he was away. Well why would he ask you? You fucking him? Not even a hand job, I swear to god. Is she fucking him? Excuse me? Rox, meet Randy's old lady. Brandy. Brandy and Randy, that's adorable. Don't worry, Randy's not her type. Oh yeah? What's her type? You. Well that doesn't explain what you're doing in his place. He asked me to keep an eye on things while he's doing time. He gave me a key and everything. He gave you a key? Yeah. Real exclusive club huh? So what do you want? Not that it's any of your business, but he asked me to keep an eye on the place too. If you're looking to score, you're gonna be disappointed. You don't know Randy the way I do. You'll clean this up? You looking after the place and all. And water the fucking plants! You need to see the news. Now! Police made a grizzly discovery this morning finding a body in the trunk of a car abandoned at a local shopping mall. The car reportedly belongs to a Chicago Veterinarian who is now missing. Police haven't confirmed if the body is the missing vet and have not released any names, pending notification of loved ones. In other news, the governor... Fuck! Fuck fuck! I knew it I knew it! That's it. It's cut and run time. These guys are fucking around. No. No? Did you not see what they did? They killed Allana and now they're gonna kill us Roxy. If we run, they'll catch us.

Well, later bitches. ♪ This is what you get ♪ ♪ This is what you ♪ ♪ This is what you get ♪ ♪ This is what you get ♪ ♪ When you mess with it ♪ ♪ This is what you get ♪ ♪ This is what you get ♪ ♪ This is what you ♪ Let's see if I've got this straight. You knew the victim in the tub. You knew the victim in the trunk. And you know the first victims partner, Roxy Myers, who is missing. Have I got it right so far? Yes ma'am. Sounds like you're quite the expert in the little strip club. I've attended a few functions there. I'll bet. Okay, let's hear this theory of yours. Well the murders three years ago were drug related. Everyone knows that. Sure, and everyone thought it was Crystal and Vince. And that Crystal killed Vince so she wouldn't have to share the money, and the mob killed Crystal when they found out. But I think we got it all wrong. How so? What if Crystal wasn't the only dancer involved? What if Allana and Maggie helped her? Maybe Roxy too. Why would they do that? I don't know, but I think the mob has come to the same conclusion. What proof do you have? This morning I saw one of their hitman in town. You sure? We questioned him three years ago and Crystal looked like his work but there was nothing linking him. A mob hitman's in town. Three mob hitmen are in town. This guy I was talking about is the middle of three brothers. They always work together. Shit. We got to find Roxy Myers before they do or we're gonna have another body on our hands. Do you know what to do next? Yeah, head straight to the Sheriff's station and leave the truck where it can't be missed. You're getting the hang of this. I could drop you off at the prison first. Leave you at the bus station there. Nah, they'll be looking for the truck by now. Safer to arrive by bus. Slip in with the other women visiting their bad choices. Be safe Roxy. You too. See you back at the apartment. Randy my man! You! If you wanna make some easy money, get in. You wanna score or what? You look different. Less like a cunt that I remember. It's nice to see you too. What do you want Roxy? When I heard that you wanted to see me I didn't think you'd be stupid enough to show your face around here. After what you did to me. You shouldn't have raped Allana. I should've killed Allana and Crystal too. Then I wouldn't be in here and I'd still have my balls. But you did kill Allana. What are you talking about? They found her body yesterday in the trunk of her car. Oh that's some shit luck. For me. What do you mean? You honestly didn't know? We don't exactly get the latest news in here. They're showing Joss Night in the common room. You didn't have her killed? Her and Maggie. Who the fuck is Maggie? And how do you figure I can have anybody killed from in here? Your drug connections. Oh, you mean the guys who blame me for the 900 grand you took? Dream on. I'm surprised at you. You're missing the most important thing. Why do you suppose I didn't roll over on you and Allana when the cops questioned me in my hospital bed? Until yesterday I thought you were dead so I haven't given it much thought. Then let me tell you. I didn't roll over because. I got this idea, this obsession of what I'm gonna do to you when I get out of here. And I've been counting the days. 918. In case you're wondering. So, when I tell you that no one is more saddened to hear about Allana's untimely demise than me, you can be assured I'm 100% sincere. Because whatever they did to her, it was a mercy compared to what I had planned. You should tell the guards your rehabilitation isn't taking. I've raped Allana, oh, 1,000 times. You a few too. Even though you're not my type. When I got out of here. I was gonna find Allana and I was gonna rape her in ways they don't even have words for. Hey! I even still get erections you know. Maybe not like I used to, but enough to start the job. Finishing is the problem. No nut to bust thanks to you. I was gonna give it to her the way that she deserves. Some guys, they're to proud to use sex toys to finish. But not me. Oh no. I was gonna bring a bag of them. Baseball bats, broken bottles, maybe even a chainsaw. You are a sick asshole and I hope you're getting raped in here every night. Oh I'm nobody's bitch. But you on the other hand... I got to go. Thanks for the info. Take real good care of yourself Roxy. I wouldn't want anything to happen to you before I got out of here. If you wanna kill me, you'll have to get in line. Oh. I'm not gonna kill ya. That'd be too good for you. I'm gonna rip your clit off with my teeth and spit it in your face! Come on Roxy! Come on! Come on Roxy! I'm gonna fuck you up! You fucking me you cunt! You slut! Hi. Yes, I have some information about the dead women. My name? I don't really feel safe giving out my name. If they find out. Look, I'm just trying to help okay. I work at the diner, we had three men come in and I overheard them speaking about stuffing the girl in the trunk of her car and killing another one in the tub. I mean they could've just been talking big. You know? But they were really really scary looking. No, no, I've never seen them before. But they kinda stand out. Bald, big biker types. One of them even said they shot the girl between the eyes in the bathtub. No, no, I told you that I don't wanna give my name. Okay, maybe I shouldn't have called. I have to get back to work. Find all the answers you're looking for? No way Stag is involved. He wants us dead no doubt, but he wants the satisfaction of doing it himself. As slowly as possible. Guys and their balls huh. You're okay? I'm fine, you make the call? Just like you said. And left the truck where they can't miss it. And you found Mazzato? Max led me straight to him. It's a church on Maple. I'm certain now Vinnie killed them. And tomorrow he pays. Better pay a lot. Is this just about the money for you? I'm a realist. If you think those guys are mad the first time Roxy robbed them, just wait until she does it again. She's right. We need to get as far as we can as quickly as we can and never come back. And that costs. I don't know about you guys, but I don't feel like eating boiled noodles for the rest of my life. Do you have a bolo out on those Beaufort brothers? Yeah, why do you ask? Because there's two of them in the parking lot trying to break into a truck. Show me. This was so much easier with Stag. He does it to himself. Max says the old man never touches that shit. Give me a syringe Jess. I can't believe I let you talk me into this. Drugging the old man? No. Using a full dose of epinephrine. If I get a bee sting now, I'm done for. What? It's in the middle of winter dummy. There are no bees. Do you know how much one of these kits cost? I'll buy you a new one. You got the wrong idea detective. My brother and I... It takes some balls to try to steal a truck from a police station. That's what I'm trying to explain. We weren't trying to steal it, just get a look inside. I swear, a friend of mine had one just like it get stolen last week. I thought maybe you'd impounded it. Lucky for us. So you didn't know it belongs to Roxy Myers? Roxy who? And you didn't pay a visit to her apartment two nights ago and shoot Maggie Tucker? Shoot a woman? What do you take me for? How about Allana Styles, that name ring a bell? You hear that? No? Me neither. Let me see if you're still laughing when ballistics matches one of those guns we pulled off of you to Tucker or Styles. How long do you figure on holding me? You got somewhere you need to be? Thought I might get a drink at the joint across the street if it's still open. You might even join me once you realize what a mistake you've made. Dream on. It's about time. I thought you forgot about me. Where is Carl? According to my sources, you and your little brother don't do anything unless big brother tells you to. Is that so? It is. So when I catch you trying to jack a truck in my parking lot, I know Carl can't be far. Shows what you know. First of all, we weren't trying to "jack" a truck. It turns out it's a dead ringer for a friends truck that was stolen last week and we were just trying to... Get a look inside. Yes, I already heard that story. Just one problem. The truck belongs to a missing dancer whose girlfriend was just killed a couple nights ago. That sounds like a you problem. Could be. Except you and your brothers seem to roll into town at exactly the same time two women end up with bullets in their head. Oh oh. I thought you said the other one was only missing? Found a Chicago vet in the trunk of her car. You're from Chicago aren't you? Yeah. Along with about five million other people. What's your point? Turns out, before she was a vet, she was a dancer right here in Stracony. Figures. Every second girl in Stracony is a stripper. I wouldn't be surprised if you climbed the pole on your nights off. Hm? I'm flattered. But there is only one club in town and I'm told that you and your brothers used to be regulars back when Stag ran things. Ah. Before some crazy bitch neutered him you mean. A lot of coincidences don't you think? I think that even a first year law student could poke so many holes in your story that you stand a better chance of being convicted than us. And our lawyer is not a first year law student. Look at that. That's probably him now with my bail. It has been a pleasure detective. And, don't take offense, but only in a shitty little town like this could you be the lead detective in a double homicide. Run along. Hey Rox. Rox. He did that to you? Jesus Rox. You're stronger than this. You need to leave that piece of shit. I've got no place to go. Bullshit, you can stay with me as long as you like. Come on, let's get your stuff. Let's get out of here. Bad idea. He's drunk and looking for a fight. When have you ever known me to back down from a fight? I'll come to your place but, I'm too tired to get my stuff. It'll still be there tomorrow. Tomorrow, you have to make them pay. Them? This maybe wasn't the best car if you want to blend in. Your truck is probably impounded by now. The car she arrived in has a body in the trunk. Randy's car would stick out even more. Whatever possessed you to buy a pink Cadillac? It's my cover. I can't tell my mom what I do for a living. So I told her I sell cosmetics. Mary... Yup, and I'm bitching good at it too. If anyone asks. They don't give these babies out to just anyone. I think I'm gonna be sick. Ooh, not on the leather. You'll be fine. Just do the way we talked. What if he's not here? That's his truck. Okay, but what if he's not alone? Max says he's always alone this time of day. This place is just a front. They sell Jesus like I sell mascara. Okay, but what if he's just... No more what if's. Time to roll. Should've taken you up on your offer to run to Cabo. Damn it. You really think she can do this? What choice do we have? The old man knows us. We wouldn't even make it through the door. What if he recognizes her? Bad dye job aside. He wasn't at the club by the time she was there. If she doesn't pull off her part, I'm running Rox. You can come or you can stay, but I'm gone. She'll do it. We're closed. I'm sorry. My car broke down, could I please use your phone? Really? Please? It's freezing out here. Alright, come on in. Thank you. I'd offer you a ride but I got to be here all day. That's okay. I have Triple AAA. Come, I got a phone in my office. Right, here's the phone. Do you think you could dial it for me? My fingers are kind of frozen. Sure. What's the number? I don't care whose turn it is, haul your ass on stage! What now? What can I do for you detective? You missing some girls Will? Something's wrong. What is it Jess? He's not breathing. Okay, I gave him the injection and he just dropped. He's supposed to be... He's not breathing! I think I killed him. Shit! You said that it would just knock him out Roxy, not kill him! It didn't kill Stag! Maybe he had a heart attack. Okay, okay. What do we do now? We get out of here right now. No! Not without the money. We stick to the plan. What? The plan? The plan just died! All the money that they ran through the club comes here now! You said so! It's got to be here! If there's any money, it's in the safe. He's not gonna give us the combination now! Well you did it before with Stag. Stag was an idiot! He had the numbers written right on the wall for everyone to see! So let's assume this one isn't a road scholar either! Jesus! This would go a lot faster if you two helped! You know what, I'm gonna go check the other room. You guys check here. Oh fuck. What kind of fucked up town gives a drug dealer the key to the city? Welcome to Stracony. I found it. Fuck. This is different than Stag's. Can you crack it? Do I look like I can crack it? Just do whatever you did last time. I told you, the combination was written on the wall. Okay. Well. It's hopeless. Just think Rox. Some of the numbers on Stag's safe were worn more than the others. That's what clued me. Maybe it's not a code. What do you mean? Jess, go get me the key to the city. You don't think... I got it. - You did it! - Oh my god. See if you can find some bags. Okay. How much do you think is here? Maybe 300,000. Not my biggest score, but it'll get us out of here. Guys. I will be damned. You have missed your calling Ms. Myers. You can keep the money, just let us go. No one will ever know. They'll know. Of course they'll know. Just like they knew you were the one that popped Stag's safe. Well, thanks for letting us know where she'd be doll. We owe ya one. Oh, you owe me a lot more than just one. How could you do this? They're gonna kill us. You killed my aunt. Call it even. Crystal was your aunt. Only family I had left. And you killed her. She tried to kill me and Allana. Does it look like I care Roxy? You fucking bitch. I knew there was fucking something off about you. You never came here with Allana. That was all bullshit. You didn't even know her! By the time I made her acquaintance, she was cold and dead, and being stuffed into her trunk. She seemed nice though. A little quiet. You're crazy! Better crazy than dead Roxy. Well, I have a plane to catch. Oh, you better shoot that one again. She's bulletproof. Bye Roxy. Let's get it over with. Not here, come on. Let's go downstairs. We made it Rox. Hair of the dog. To us. I thought that we could visit the Alamo. Oh and the Riverwalk. The guidebook says it's the jewel of San Antonio. Lightweight. Oh, now look what I've done. That was very careless of me. I guess maybe my hands aren't as steady as they used to be. Well now. What a waste. Please. Please, please. I just want you to know that I take no pleasure in this. Please, please. Making an example of you is one thing, sure. But this, this is... Please god. Stag was very particular about how this goes. No, no, no! He was very specific. My god. But I take no pleasure in it. Stay with me Rox. Stay here. You need to leave now. Take that money and go. Not without you. I called 9-1-1, the cops will be here soon. I need a doctor okay. A real one this time. I can tell them what happened. They'll seize the money! And then this'll all have been for nothing. You take that car and you get gone. I'll join you as soon as I can. Rox.
