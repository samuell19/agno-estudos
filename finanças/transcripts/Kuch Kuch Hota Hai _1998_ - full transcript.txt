"Something happens" "Something happens" Hey Rahul, do you want to be my friend? She's just like her father. Isn't she? Tina is very critical Rahul. She doesn't have much time. We tried our best, Rahul. But her internal bleeding was too much that, We couldn't do anything. She knew... I had told her that there would be complications in her delivery. But... she also knew how much you wanted this child. She also loved this baby more than her own life. I want my daughter to know me. Who her mother was, How she was like. She should know the answers to these questions. Mother... I am leaving these 8 letters with you... ...one letter for each of her birthdays. These letters have everything that I want to tell my daughter. They are going to be my daughter's memories of me. You are very bad. You are very bad . Rahul? Hey Rahul... Do you want to be my friend?

I'm your daughter, not your wife! Why? If I can be both your father and mother at once... ...then why can't you be... Okay. Nah. Nu-uh. What is it? - Did it feel bad? A bit. Sorry. - Okay. Okay. That is why one says... One God. Multiple forms! But no matter what form he takes... Our prayers and worship are definitely reaching him! Therefore, it is very important to keep a steady bond with God. She speaks so well doesn't she? That's all for today. Now, to finish, we'll have... Did you know that I got this as a gift on Valentine's Day! Roopa! Yes? - Roopa will now... recite for us the "Divine Hymn". What me? Go on Roopa. The Divine Hymn! I... forgot it. What? What are you saying Rupa? Did you hear that sisters?? Our Roopa has forgotten the Divine Hymn! My dear if you won't pay attention to your prayers... ...then what example will you set for your children? What we think and what we say... ...have a deep and profound impact on our children. Right ladies? Then how will her children... - Granny! Oh! Speaking of children, My grandaughter! Anjali. Namaste. Hi sexy! She can't teach her own grandaughter... Who taught you that? Papa did! Go get ready for your school function. Go! Granny... Give me the letter. When is your birthday? - Tomorrow. So? Oh. Go. Come on, hurry up, hurry! These are our seats. - Come sit. Come Mr Khanna come! Sit please! Hello how are you! - Doing well! Hello. Enough. Good evening ladies and gentlemen. And, welcome to the "Just One Minute Competition". This is such a strange competition. The children have to talk on the stage... ...and the topic is also given right here... ...in some strange bowl! - Yes. Yes. On the spot, sir! On the spot! Stop it Balbir! Control yourself. It's okay ma'am, let him hit me. Remember. each student will only be given one minute. Just one minute! Just minute? Just One minute? Does this mean they'll get only one minute? Exactly! Big problem. But our Jassu still wins every year. She's so talented you know. Best of luck Jaswinder. - Same to you . Our Jaswinder is the best sir, the best! Actually Anjali is also participating. She'll come second! Not to worry. Thank you very much sir. - Welcome sir! Welcome! Our first contestant is Jaswinder Singh! Oh my sweetheart! Oh Jassi let loose! Jassu! Jassu! Jassu! Jassu! - Let loose! Pull out all the stops! My topic is Pooja (worship). We worship the Lord every morning. Papa says that worship makes the Lord happy with us... ...and protect us from evil.

Pooja Bhatt is my favorite actress. ...and my best friend's name is also Pooja. Okay thank you. Wow! My sweetheart! Next we have Anjali Khanna! Pick your topic. Second! - Okay. And your timer starts now! Say it! Mother! Mother! Mother! I'm sorry. Mother... A mother is someone... who loves us so much... ...that even we sometimes can't understand it. A mother is someone who makes us realize how amazing we are. ...that there is no one better than us. A mother is someone, whose happiness is in our laughter. ...whose sorrow is in our sorrow. A mother is someone we can't truly live without... Mother... A mother is everything. Only we just don't have her. But we have Papa... And he's pretty nice too. Then you give me a hug . Oye that's number one! Number one! Rahul do you remember Mr. Sharma? He phoned. Mr. Sharma who? Our neighbor in Delhi. He has sent a marriage proposal. For whom? Me. Why don't you accept it. Shut up! Anyways, he was saying that the girl is very beautiful and well-mannered. ...but I refused comprehensively. Did I do the right thing? - Yes. I did the right thing? - Yes. I did the right thing? Yes mom. Yeah, well, I must have done the right thing. It's not like I do anything wrong. Everything I do is right. So what if the girl is well-mannered and beautiful. All girls are beautiful and well-mannered these days. Who even wants to get married here? Mr. Sharma is stupid. Keeps sending me proposals. Why doesn't he get married himself? And just leave me alone. What's wrong mom? I don't know Rahul. I just find this family incomplete. Why? You're here, I'm here. Anjali is here. I don't find it incomplete. You know, When I go out with my friends... ...they all complain about their daughters-in-law. Really? - I can't even do that. This is a very big problem. So, you need a daughter-in-law because you want to complain about her to others. No, son. I just want to see you happy. I am happy. Very happy. So you won't ever marry again? Mom we only live once, we only die once. We only marry once. And we fall in love only once. Not again and again. You can manage just fine, my son... But what of Anjali? Why? What's happened to her? Don't you feel... ...that she needs a mother? She's fine mom. She's just fine. Because she has something... ...which I don't even have. Her mother's letters. Happy Birthday, Anjali. My dear Anjali, Happy birthday! You're 8 years old today! And I'm sure that you're just like your dad. Same smile, same eyes. Right, Anjali? No! I'm just like you. Tell me Anjali, does your father still go to bed wearing his shoes? Old habits die hard. You're a big girl today Anjali, which is why you can understand... ...the things I'm about to tell you today. Today I'm going to tell you a story. This story features Me, your Papa and... Anjali. Anjali? Late again. I can't wake up early. Can't wake up or were you scared? Hey! Rahul Khanna isn't scared of anybody. Rahul Khanna is never scared of anybody. Yeah. But still loses to Anjali Sharma every single day in basketball. You wanna play or not? What's the point? You lose every day. I won't lose today. You say that everyday. We'll see. We'll see. Hey! If you can't play atleast don't cheat. Hey! Don't call me a cheater. That's what you are, cheater, cheater, cheater! Anjali, don't call me a cheater. Rahul is a cheater! - Not a cheater. He is a cheater! He is a cheat... - Not a cheater! Cheater! Stop screaming like a girl! Hey! Don't call me a girl. Actually, you're right. You're not a girl. Atleast I'm better than the stupid girls you run after. Escuze moi! l don't run after girls, girls run after me. Wow! Rahul is so cute! - Wow is right, Yes. He's so sweet. He's so handsome right?? Not as handsome as you though, your moustache is bigger.

Where has the ladder gone? Ladder! Ladder! Malhotra! Why are you sneaking like a thief into your own home? Heeheeheeehee - What "Heeheeheeehee"? Rahul what are you doing? Anjali I was actually coming to see you. - Me? Why? Because... Hey Anjali, look a shooting star! Where? - Not down here! Up there! Oh. - You know, they say that... if you make a wish on a shooting star, it's granted. You really believe that? No harm in trying right? "You came close to me." "Smiled ever so sweetly."

The butler did it! Ow! Hey! Look at that. Oh God! What is she wearing? Hi guys! - Hi! How do l look? Just like Tina, see? Oh God she looks... - Tell me! like she's on crack. I'm sorry. Stop it Rahul. Shut up. Here? Okay. I'm so stupid aren't I. I just wanted to look pretty like you... ...but I don't know anything. You're beautiful Anjali. Very beautiful. You're lying. Didn't you hear everyone laughing? Those... - people are idiots like me. Actually, you're the most beautiful... ...because you're not like anyone else. Atleast you're not like the stupid girls I keep running after. You know, you can literally have any boy that you want. Anyone? - Anyone. Anyone? - Anyone. But he has to be cockeyed. Stop it. Ok now tell me, where did you get the lipstick from? You know that girl in our class, 'Babli'? She gave it to me. I'll beat her up nicely if I find her. And these amazing clothes? - Shut up. "Love is a strange thing. Love is inexplicable." "It is unaware of all happiness and all pain." Papa! Rahul. Papa? - What papa? You can't keep secrets from me. But Rahul? You really couldn't find anyone else? Come on papa. Actually, I would have felt just as bad... ...even if it were not Rahul and someone else. Why? Cuz I'll have to share your love with him. I love you papa. That is the problem. I love you too. Have you confessed your feelings to him yet? I don't know why but I feel that Anjali also loves... Tina! I know for a fact that Rahul loves only you. And Anjali is just his best friend. That's the long and short of it. No papa. Hidden in this deep friendship somewhere, is pure love... And I don't want to come between this friendship that can blossom into pure love. The entire college knows... ...that Rahul and Anjali are best friends, nothing else. Go! Go and tell him that you love him more than anything. But I don't even know if he loves me back. Don't keep matters of the heart a secret. Go and tell him. Hmm? I love you. I... love you. Shit. I never thought I'd ever say this to someone. But I... I really love you. Shit. I hope I have the courage to tell her this. I've thought so many times about just telling her... ...but everytime I approach her and try to tell her... ...I try so hard but when I'm with her I don't know... Tell whom? Tina, who else? Let's do this again. I'll be Rahul and you can be Tina, okay? Hey, look up, please. I... Here. I love you. I love you too. She'll say it too right? Ya? - Yeah. Come here. Shall I tell her? Shall I go right now? "O! my Lord..." "Don't let love torture someone like this." "What is in the heart forever stays in the heart." "And never escapes from one's lips." I couldn't get my first love, Rifat bi. I couldn't get my first love. I love you . "You did not remember me, there is nothing more left to say." "You did not remember me, there is nothing more left to say." "The heart cried and the eyes welled up" "The heart cried and the eyes welled up" "There is nothing more left to say." "You did not remember me, there is nothing more left to say." "You did not remember me, there is nothing more left to say." "The heart cried and the eyes welled up" "The heart cried and the eyes welled up" "There is nothing more left to say." "You did not remember me, there is nothing more left to say." "You did not remember me, there is nothing more left to say." Mama! "I gave you all of my joys." "Gave you all of my smiles." "Your locks enticed me, bidding me promises of faithfulness." "You didn't care for my love." "You didn't care for my love." "There's nothing more left to say." "You did not remember me, there is nothing more left to say." "You did not remember me, there is nothing more left to say." Excuse me. Sorry. Anjali! Anjali! Sorry ma'am. Rahul you look ahead, I'll look there. - Sounds good. Anjali!... Anjal- One minute. Where are you off to? Back home. - What? I got a letter from mama, Baba isn't feeling well... ...and there's lots of work in the new house. Have you gone mad? You got a letter and you're leaving? You're not going anywhere. - Rahul, I have to, Rahul. How can you leave in the middle of the semester? C'mon. Rahul please try to understand... - Go after final exams. Rahul... - Go after the final exams. Rahul please! - After final exams. Rahul I might not come back for final term either. I'm not coming back Rahul. Oh! So you're leaving the college. Leaving me. And you didn't even bother to tell me. Okay. Rahul... - I don't wanna know. Rahul I'm leaving. - Leave! Rahul I'm going! - Go! Rahul, I'm not coming back. - I don't care, okay? Shit. Anjali! Anjali! Anjali. Anjali... Please don't leave. Who will I play basketball with? You lost everyday anyways. Then why are you going? Mama needs me Rahul... - And I don't need you? Now you irritate Tina! You've irritated me enough. I'll fail class! - Then fail! Hey Anjali... Stop chasing those stupid girls now yeah? Hey! - Hey! Hey... I'll miss you, my friend. I'll miss you too. That day l realised that perhaps... ... I had come between Rahul and Anjali. Perhaps I had come between two friends... Anjali's silence told me all that I needed to know. And that day I was convinced that she loved your father more than anything else. Perhaps even I couldn't love him as much. Anjali never called or wrote to us since. She had gone away from our lives. Forever. Your father used to say, "Love is friendship". Yes, I did become his friend, but I could never become his best friend. My child, I know your father very well. He's very lonely, but will never say anything. His life lacks a best friend, it lacks pure love. That friend is Anjali, my child. That pure love is Anjali. Please bring Anjali back into your father's life my child. Return Anjali her first love. Anjali and Rahul are made for each other. This is the truth, and this is my final wish. Will you fulfill your mother's last wish? Please bring Anjali back into Rahul's life Bring Anjali back into your Papa's life. Fulfill my final wish my child, please fulfill my final wish. Happy Birthday! Give me five. Sorry. Hello! Yes, this is Malhotra speaking. ...using STD on my personal phone. Yes, so are you all coming tomorrow? Yes, yes! As soon as we reach Delhi we'll take the Faridabad train. The one at 4 o'clock? - Yes, that one. Ugh! What are you doing? Me? I was just... hair... nothing! No! Sorry not you. Butlers in Mumbai are something else... Okay, okay.... So I'm coming to pick all of you up tomorrow. Are you sure? You forgot to last time. Well last time... Don't worry, I'll come this time! Also, the materials for the death anniversary... Yes, yes! I'm bringing all of it with me. Not to worry. Okay then, Goodbye. - Bye. Hi guys! This is Neelam and you're... ...watching your favourite show. The Neelam Show! In today's show, we are going to do something new. We're going to play a game! Would all of you like to play this game? They say that this game brings out whatever is in your heart to your lips. I'll say a word... ...and you have to then say the first word that comes to your mind after hearing it.

C'mon Papa, it's my birthday! Okay. It's your birthday! Anjali Sharma went to college with me. In your college? She was my friend. Friend! She was my best friend. She has a very nice name, Papa. What was she like? Anjali! She wasn't like other girls. She was like... one of the boys. You know, all the girls wore makeup. But not Anjali, Anjali... played basketball. And clothes... she wore clothes exactly like mine, Yeah, really! She was crazy, my Anjali. Dressing up, wearing makeup, acting elegantly and feminine... ...was just not for her. Is that enough or do you wanna know more still? Papa where is she now? I don't know. I just can't believe that you're getting engaged, Anjali! By the way, the Priest has just arrived downstairs to fix the date for your wedding. Show me that one. How much will you decorate yourself? Hurry! Aman is getting impatient. Tell him to wait a bit longer. This bride will take her time. "Your groom has been waiting for so long." "Don't delay anymore, come quickly!" "Your groom has been waiting for so long."

"You're not aware but hearts in love break too." "You're not aware but hearts in love break too." "Listen to the voice of one who is crazy about you, listen, listen, listen..." "The Bridegroom has come home." "The Bridegroom has come home." "Why is the bride shy?" "The Bridegroom has come home."

What Grandpa you can't even do this much for me? I can anything for you but... - Really! Too bad! The college principal can't even do this much. Bruh where did "principal" come from? One minute... She would definitely know where Anjali Sharma is. "Allah is the greatest!" "Allah is the greatest!" I'm sorry, Principal sir. But I had promised Anjali that... ...I would not give her address to anyone. We had come with a lot of expectations... I understand Principal sir, but I made a promise to Anjali. Rifat bi, I'm Anjali too. Won't you tell me either? Principle sir she's getting engaged today... ...and her wedding is this week. Her mother follows a priest, he's also arriving today to fix a date for the wedding. Everything is ready. You have come very late. Principal sir, I was also planning to leave for the event on tomorrow's train. This marriage cannot happen, mummy said so. It just can't happen. Your honor, we have to fix the date of the wedding. Yes, my child. This is Aman's horoscope. - Yes. Aman wants to return this month to London, your honor. If you could fix a date for this month, it would really be convenient. This month? - Yes, your honor. Principal sir, if you had came earlier then maybe something could be... Yes but we didn't know... "Allah is the greatest!" "Allah is the greatest!" "Allah is the greatest!" "Allah is the greatest!" "I bear witness that there is no God but Allah." My child, Anjali's stars have a negative influence right now. Until it changes, she cannot get married. "I bear witness that there is no God but Allah." What about next month, your honor? - Not even next month. "I bear witness that that Muhammad is a Prophet of God." Anjali can't get married before December. Hello! I had heard of God's mercy before, but I've witnessed it today. The child's prayer has been answered. Anjali's wedding has been postponed till December. Anjali. Can I ask you something? Yes. Are you happy, my child? What sort of a question is that, mother? Of course I'm happy. I've just gotten engaged. Aman's a really nice man... He loves me a lot. And then he's... - But do you love him? Anjali. I've already loved once mother. I've already loved. I'm not sure I can do it again. Just think of this as a compromise. Compromise? I never thought that my daughter would marry out of compromise and not out of love. I'm your mother afterall, don't I want you to be happy too? That you go to a loving home with lots of love? But a home based on compromise instead of love is... ...not a home my child, it's a house. The rest is upto you. Oh no! I can't handle all these hymns... Yes I can. The Priest is going to recite both hymns and the holy book today. Wow! Amazing, just amazing. If I just get my hands on this Priest... Why? He has delayed my wedding, dear! I cannot handle this anymore. Look, listening to all of these hymns will irritate God too. Why? Don't you have anything to ask God for? Why, I have you. What more could I want? And now a few kids would be nice. And I'm afraid God has no role in this, I will do what needs to be done. Behave yourself. - Hey Aman! Aman. Aman! Good morning! Good morning! Aman I saw you exercising this morning. Topless. You were looking delicious. - What are you saying! Wow Kammo, fires of youth even in your old age? What are you saying. You're the old one. Hey, get aside! Don't trouble him! Look what a nice and beautiful boy he is. Do you have a brother or something? What are you saying? My Gurpreet is also very pretty. What are you saying? Forget Gurpreet! My Jaspreet is Ms. Chandigarh. What are you saying? Is she Ms. Chandigarh or Ms. Sector 11? Listen, listen, listen! Come on now, the Priest has started. Goodbye. - Okay bye Aman. - Bye! - Bye! Anjali. Anjali, there is a call for you. Excuse me. Thank you so much, mother-in-law. Welcome, son-in law. Hello? Hello? Hello! Hello! - Hello! Hello! - I love you. Huh... Aman. I have a little problem... What? - Please stop leaving me like this. Aman I don't know who is on the line. Hello? And anyway you're going to Simla for your summer camp for a whole month. You're going to Bombay too. For 24 hours only and you're going for a month. Aman you know that I go every year, to teach those kids singing and dancing.s Those kids are part of my life now. Great, even they are a part of your life now. Now I'm the only one left. Hello! Why do I get the feeling that you don't love me? Because I don't. And that you don't want to marry me. Right, I don't. Hey! Any problem happens this time... ...and l'll drag you to the marraige pandol. You'll force me? - If need be. Do you have the guts? Just try me. Hey Aman! - I'll stay here with your aunts. You can go to Simla for your summer camp. Summer camp! Simla! What? Summer camp in Simla? No-no-no-no. You're not going to any summer camp. My child, it snows a lot there. Papa it's a summer camp! Whatever! You're not going! Is this okay? Yes! Papa I heard that they teach singing and dancing there as well! And you know how fond I am of that! Since when have you been fond of them? I said no once didn't I. No means no. That's it! Papa not fair! Let her go. All kids go... - Mom don't you start now... Please, please. Dont spoil the child. Mom! I'll handle this okay! But Rahul be supportive. Why can't she go? I'll go with her as well! Papa I wanna go. I wanna go. I wanna go! No Anjali! - ...but I love singing and dancing! No! - Yes! Silence! When I've refused once that means no one will go! There is no need to argue! Neither of you will go to the summer camp! Alright? Okay! You understand that? Good! Did it feel bad? I'm sorry. It's okay. Okay. But this does not mean you're going to the summer camp. Okay? And no one mention summer camp again. I'm going to my conference! We'll talk when l get back. Papa. - Now what? You haven't worn your pants. I don't wanna wear them. You guys can wear them if you want. What is it? Driver take out the pant! ... take out the car! Anjali... this is good and all... We'll go to the summer camp but... How will we get your papa to come there? Oh c'mon Granny! Remember when I was 4 and Papa had went to London... ...and I had a really bad flu and fever. Yes my baby, Yes! Granny. Papa left everything and came back immediately. So? Look, according to me, this export policy is not going to hold much water. Oops sorry! - Hey, don't worry about it man it's okay. Look, every exporter is going to ask himself... Indian Exporter's Conference, Good evening! Hello, May I speak with Aman Mehra please?

Where to? - Summer camp! Again with the summer camp! When I said you're not going it means you're not going! Listen... I'm feeling very.... Give me a kiss. This is your mother speaking! Look, I don't like jokes like this. My mother passed away 10 years ago. Oh God, why is everyone trying to pronounce me dead. No summer camp! No summer camp! No summer camp! Do you understand that? Aman, why are you screaming? I'm screaming because I said no about the summer camp didn't I? Now listen, if you mention summer camp one more time, I'll come home and... Slap you! Aman you've gone mad! Anjali? Your papa has gone mad. Anjali? Anjali? Anjali? Yeah Anjali. Confusion, confusion. Hi! Rahul Khanna. - Aman Mehra, how're you doing? I guess she got confused because of the same name. I'll bet you something though, that my Anjali is much more beautiful than your Anjali. No! My Anjali is very beautiful. I'm sure, but she can't be more beautiful than my Anjali. My Anjali is my 8 year old daughter. Oh shit! Then your Anjali is definitely prettier than mine. Anyways, best of luck with your Anjali. Best of luck to you too man, take care. Dear Papa. Sorry Granny and I left without informing you... ...but you know how much I love singing and dancing. But I'm really sorry Papa. Try not to miss me too much. Love you, Anjali. That's not possible for me to do. Anjali! Good Morning kids! Welcome to Camp Sunshine! I'm the manager of this camp, Col.

Yes, what is it? Do you have no shame? You have hoisted the British flag. I love England. My father was a tailor during English times. He stitched this flag himself, you know. The British went and left Almeida behind. - That's good. You fool! You should teach your kids that "My (Bharat)India is the greatest". Who's Bharat? Here you go. - Thank you . Hey! What's your name? Hey! Oops. Sorry. What's your name? Anjali. Hey that's my name! Hi! Why is your name Anjali? Maybe because my mummy daddy liked the name, that's why. Why is your name Anjali?

I want to see how you cook food. What? And where is the (Pooja)prayer room? Pooja is not on duty today. Pooja as in prayer, remembering the Lord by singing hymns. Madam! We don't do that here! What?

Men are very weak, my child. Very weak. They do establish principles, but forget that no principle can stand against the heart. And us? We remind this weak and stubborn males that... ...bonds of the heart are established by heartbeats, not principles. But these bonds of the heart... ...can only be formed by saying what your heart desires. Tell him how you feel Anjali. Sometimes, saying what's in your heart can... break a heart as well. If you don't say anything, then it won't be happy either. Won't be happy either! Congratulations, and celebrations! Congratulations, and celebrations! We wish Ms. Anjali a happy wedded life! C'mon kids! Lunch is ready... Congratulations and celebrations. What Anjali! You didn't even tell me. Aman told me that you are due to get married. Hey! Congratulations. You're happy right? You are happy aren't you? Are you happy after hearing this news? I'm very happy. Then how can I be happy? I don't understand. Something happens, Rahul. You won't understand. Something happens, Anjali. You won't understand. Uncle? - Yeah? Can I ask you something? - Yes sweetie. Why... Why are you marrying Ms. Anjali? What? Why? ls something wrong? Yes there is! See, it's very simple. Explain. You're so handsome. What happened? - So good looking! Oh! Thank you so much! But Ms. Anjali isn't good looking at all, Very bad! - Lemme see. You know, you're right. She's dark, she's fat and she's short. Yes! You know you can get anyone you want, right? I can get anyone? - Yes! Then will you marry me? Me?! No, no, no, no! Why am I that bad? Then you'll have to find a nice girl for me. Found her! - Who? Her! The one from MTV? Hi this is the Neelam show... Yo! Yo! Then what will become of this Anjali?

I want to go back tonight. Goodbye, Mr. Almeida. You're leaving? Please don't go. Please don't go. Anjali. You gave this to Tina... when she was going to start a new life. Today, you are also going to begin a new life. And I know... ...that you and Rahul will be very happy together. Aman. Aman. Aman. "O! My love." "O! My love." "You did not remember me, there is nothing more left to say." "You did not remember me, there is nothing more left to say." "The heart cried and the eyes welled up" "The heart cried and the eyes welled up" "There is nothing more left to say." "You did not remember me, there is nothing more left to say." Start the wedding preparations. I don't want to wait any longer. Bu Anjali, the priest said that there is no auspicious date before December. Mother... Hapiness doesn't come from dates, but rather fates. Which nothing can change. Look! Aman's here! - And he's on a mule! Bindya! The Priest is here, go see to his needs! Greetings. You're Rahul, right? Yes.... A-a-anjali and I... I know. Anjali is getting married today? Yeah... Anjali decided to get married so suddenly that I... I didn't have any time to prepare. Sister-in-law! Come here! Coming! Please sit down, I'll be right back in a second. Anjali? They say that if you make a wish on a shotting star, it's granted. Anjali! Anjali! Anjali! "I had faith in you, my love. Still I was restless." "I had faith in you, my love. Still I was restless." "I waited years for you." "But you never said then..." "...what you said just now." "The heart cries silently in the curtain of helplessness." "What should I even do?" "Something happens." "What should I even do?" "Something happens." The auspicious time is ending, Please call the bride! Anjali. The auspicious time is almost over. Please call the bride! Anjali, let's go. Didn't I tell you I'd drag you to the marriage pandol if need be? Aman? You know... I've always wanted to see the same love in your eyes... ...that I have in mine. I've seen it today for the first time. But it's not for me. You're an idiot Anjali. You've always loved only him. Ever since you've known what love is, understood it. You've loved only him. Rahul is your first love. And I know all about what first love is. And you... you were about to give it all up for me? Idiot. How can I come between this love... which wasn't mine in the first place. And in any case, someone told me that... ...that I'm so handsome, I can get any girl I like. Aman I... - What are you saying ...? Go... Go... "Adorned with a necklace of roses, has the Bridegroom came." "The bride's hands are already, painted, so what are you waiting for?" "The Bridegroom has come home." "The Bridgeroom has come home." "Why is the bride shy?" "The Bridgeroom has come home." "The Bridgeroom has come home." "The Bridgeroom has come home." "Why is the bride shy?" "The Bridgeroom has come home."
