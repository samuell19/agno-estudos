"The phantom lover" Has it come then? Peeping into my mail again? Landie, don't be like that. Let me see. Tonight. Come on. I want to see it now. All right. French lingerie! It's so pretty! Let me see. How are things going with wei qing? He says he's too poor. He says he'll marry me when he's famous. You'll have a wait then. Let me see it! What's this theatre supposed to be like? Magnificient. It'd be too fancy for a troupe like ours... Except ten years ago it was destroyed in a fire. Lots of people died... Including a famous actor. You mean song danping? Yes. That's right. Song danping was a star. He acted in path-breaking western dramas. Xian ruan. Xiao ruan, get over here. You're spending my money... On this ghastly place? Where's the caretaker? They said he lived here. What a shame to see such a place in ruins. I think we should wait outside. You! Go fetch the caretaker. - Let's go. - Landie, hurry... I want to look around. Don't worry. You go ahead. I'll be there soon. I want to see! I want to see! Don't forget about tonight. Goodbye. Help! Help! Give me your hand. I'm the caretaker. Call me uncle ma. You can stay here. But don't go running around. What's up? Nothing. I live over there. Wei qing. Where's the chocolate I put in your pocket? Chocolate? Wait a sec. Have a seat. I heard someone singing in the theatre just then. And a beautiful woman ran towards me. What kind of candy were you talking about? Chocolate. Want some? Wei qing. We're getting together... And sneaking out for a drink. Coming? No, thanks. You never go out with us. He's got landie. What's he need us for? Forget him. Let's go. I want to see! I want to see! Don't forget about tonight. Goodbye. You know everything that's happened here. I won't leave till you tell me. Any more chocolate left? Ten years ago, I just got out of prison. I'd nowhere to go. Song danping took me in. I became his Butler. Mr. song designed this theatre himself. There was nothing like it. People even doubted it could be built. People even doubted it could be built. The elite of Tianjin, Shanghai and nanjing... All flocked here to see first-class theatre... All flocked here to see first-class theatre... And bathe in mr song's glory. Every performance was a sell-out. His Romeo was as perfect as the theatre itself. His acting was brilliant and bold. Girls snuck away from home to come here. This made the elderly very angry. At that time... All the young people adored him. But Mr. song had eyes only for one... Daughter of one of the richest men in town, du yuyan. Come on. Let's go. Come on. They're expecting us. We have to hurry. Don't worry. Wait outside for me. There'll be trouble if we're late. It's cold outside. Take this and wait for me. - Miss. - Hurry, go. Miss... I've waited so long, the moon has risen. The stars are beautiful. Let me take you somewhere. Let's go! It's beautiful. Why haven't you taken me here before? Do you know what today is? The first anniversary of our meeting. Have you brought other girls here? Certainly not. Danping, I'm worried. My father's bound to find out about us. So? I'll speak to him. You don't know him. He's so stubborn. I'm afraid he'll... Is it because I'm just an actor? Danping, will you always love me? My whole life. Hurry, miss, hurry. Hurry. Don't worry. We'll make it. Let's go. Hurry. The old man will be furious if we're late. Hurry! Put on your clothes! Xiao hua, is this the right one? No, miss. It's the traditional date for wearing embroidered Phoenix jacket. Hurry. Buy a new jacket for yourself. But... Quick, the tea. Looking for a scolding? No, miss. I've heard your daughter is wild and wilful. I've heard your daughter is wild and wilful. But my son insists he loves her. So I've come to propose a union. Since your son is so keen for her hand... I see no problem. So, Mr. zhao... Consider the issue of your factory settled as well. There will be many advantages to this union. We are honored for her to enter your family. Master, your daughter is here. Come in. She's here! She's here! My respects to my father. Where were you? At the theatre again? Why haven't you greeted our guests? Hello Mr. zhao. Hello master zhao. Hello. Father, you should get some rest. Tomorrow we'll hold a banquet. You're not to go out. Yes, father. You should show filial piety to your parents. Young people mustn't take things into their own hands. They should listen to their elders. Mr. zhao has certainly spoken the truth. Yunyan... Good to see you, Mr. lu. And you, Mr. du. Mr. lu is here. - Mr. lu... - Mr. zhao... You honour us with your presence, mr lu. You're very kind. I wouldn't presume. I've heard there'll be a big announcement. I wouldn't miss it for the world. Yunyan. Yunyan, be a good host. Talk to master zhao. Yunyan. As for that son of a bitch... You're head of the arts bureau. Can you take care of him? Relax. I've made arrangements. His superiors are fed up with... His decadent ways. We'll soon see the end of him. Excellent. This unworthy son of mine... Is also interested in the arts. Mr. lu, perhaps you'll find him a job in your bureau. You cold? He clearly has tremendous promise. Ladies and gentlemen, the houses of zhao and du... Wish to take advantage of this occasion... Let my son says a few words. Stand up. Actually, it's no big deal... But I wish to, uh, announce... What's wrong? - My stomach hurts. - What? Shall I take you to your room? Sorry. How is it? Do you need a doctor? No, I just need to rest. Then... Then I can't continue now. Stop the play! Stop! Mr. zhao... Mr. zhao, what's the problem? Who are you? Head of the troupe. None of your business. Out of my way. Out of my way. Yunyan, yunyan. Why'd you fake that stomachache. Liar! Off the stage, song danping. Unless I say so, the play will not go on. Gentlemen... I don't understand your intentions. But don't you have eyes to see? These people have tickets to see a play. How can I just stop here? I'll refund your tickets. You can all go home. Look like they're not buying it. Let's try this... Ladies and gentlemen, shall I carry on or not? Carry on! Carry on! Carry on! Carry on! Get the hell out of here. Outta here! Qutta here! Carry on. I thought the best part... Was when I forced out that idiot. What's this? You can't look. I want to. You can't. - I won't let you see. - Let me see. Danping! Wait a sec. - Come on, catch me. - Don't run. Danping, if you don't stop, I'll marry that moron. My yunyan isn't that stupid. What a beautiful melody. Why'd you stop? I haven't finished writing it. When I have, I'll sing it all for you. I'll sing it only for you. Danping. Promise me... You'll sing it on every full moon for me. Xiao hua? Let me go. Yunyan, stop carrying on. It's not going to get you anywhere. Your father has already agreed to the marriage. You'll be married in three days. Forget about that song danping. Mother! Can't you think of my happiness? Mother! Miss, here's dinner. Here are the brush and ink. Miss, you have to eat. You'll starve. "Danping." "I'm being forced to marry. At 10 tonight..." "Meet me outside the theatre to elope." Yunyan. Xiao hua, promise me... You'll hand it to danping yourself. I'm leaving tonight. Tonight? You must help me. Open up! Refused her food again? You take it. I wouldn't dare. Don't worry. No one will know. You sure? Yes. Wait, I'll get you some wine. Wonderful. I want this dish myself. I'm looking for Mr. song. Where is he? I've an important letter for him. Must give it to him by hand. Do you know when he'll be back? Okay, okay. Just leave it with me, little fan. Thank you. Please hand it to him yourself. The carriage is ready, let's go. Go. She's run away! Miss, run! I won't make it! Run! - Xiao hua. - Never mind me! What're you screaming about? Break her leg! Yunyan, yunyan, don't leave. Mother, forgive me. Yunyan, don't leave. Yunyan's escaped. Quick, after her. Horse? Heaven help me! Uncle ma, where's the poison vial? I'll check outside. Dearest Mr. song... Come in. Who's there? Mr. song... The theatre's burning! Song danping's dead! Fire! Mother! Open the door! Please! The officials called mr song's death an accident. No one investigated. Du yunyan's fate was even more cruel. Mr. song is dead. Put it all behind you, miss. Remember the dunyang festival? How we snuck out to play? And... Miss, you know the money you gave me? I bought new clothes with it. See? Miss. After you're married, I won't be able to look after you. Yunyan, soon you'll say you love me. Slut! I'll kill you. Slut! No virgin blood? You sure? Crap! Your daughter has been sullied. She's not fit for our family. I wouldn't jump to conclusions. Let's call them both in and investigate. Bastard! I'm telling you, my son is not a liar! The du family is one of the wealthiest in Peking. You can bear the shame. But we zhaos are another matter. We're pulling out of this union. As for your factory, well, forget it! Don't look back. It's as though we never had such a daughter. The du's moved to the south. The zhaos went to Shanghai and Rose in the government. Du yunyan, abandoned, went mad. The loyal xiao hua found work... And supported yunyan in her old home. Every full moon, yunyan comes to the theatre... To wait for song danping to elope with her. For ten years, people have heard singing here at night. They say it's haunted. Young man, my story's finished. You can go away now. You have a karmic connection with the theatre... If you've see those apparitions. I want to be famous like song danping. Thank you... You'll have to get your hands dirty. Take that away! We're nearly finished. Hot blood is surging in my veins like the currents of the river, the tides of the sea pounding in my heart go back have rest. We're leaving. Who can help me do the dishes? Hot blood is surging in my veins like the currents of the river, the tides of the sea pounding in my heart troupe-leader, no one likes our play. Song danping had it rough at first too. Wei qing, you... You never stop talking about song danping. Just have a goddamn look at yourself. How can you compare yourself to song danping? What are you saying? Looking for a fight? Wei qing, wei qing... Come see "hot blood" by sprouts theatre. Come, all. Here, one for you. Pity, he's no song danping. What kind of play is this anyway? What a joke! Who'd go see them again? Say I'm not here. I'm not here. Gentlemen... Your rent is four weeks overdue. Yes... We're looking for the accountant, xiao ruan. We... are in difficult straits. We also need to eat, you know. Yes. No one wants to come see your plays. No one wants to come see your plays. But the rent here is very cheap. We'll think of something. Please, give us ten days. Just then. One week. Just one week. One. Take care. - Come on out. - They've left? - What'll we do? - Any ideas? Let's just try two more performances. No good. We could sneak away. How could you even think such a thing? Though seeing as we've got no other plan. I suppose it's one possibility. You all have to try to come up with something... Think up new ideas... To attract audiences and get over this hurdle. Yes... That's it. I'm writing to my mother... To pick me up at the station. Forget it. I say tomorrow morning... We go find odd jobs to support ourselves. I can't bear to leave Peking, this beautiful maiden. Don't go yet. I believe there's hope. Forget it. Go and get some sleep. Hot blood is surging in my veins like currents of the river, the tides of the sea pounding in my heart our national humiliation is the source of our fury who's there? You're... Song danping. Weren't you killed in the fire? What's it to you? I've been listening to your singing. You're not bad. Do you want to be famous? I... I just want to save our troupe. Don't beat around the bush. I'm asking, do you want to be famous? Yes, I do. Then perform this. But this is strictly between us. Don't tell a soul. Go now. "Romeo and Juliet" is a good play all right. But who will take the role of Romeo? Mel you? Give me five days. You've no other choice. Can we afford it? Just. Mr. song, I can't seem to make the high notes. Fine. Go away. No more rehearsing? Your troupe is packing up. Come on, wei qing. I've packed for you. Stop. Stop it. Mr. guan. What are you doing? Didn't you say I could try? No time for that now. Mr guan, you agreed. Forget it, I said no. I beg you. Give me one chance. Let me sing. What do you think? Great! Like song danping in the old days. Let's do it then! Everyone do your best! "Song danping has come back." Can anyone really match up to song danping? If he doesn't, we'll demand our money back. Come on, Romeo, it's about to begin. Don't worry. It's sure to be a success. Let's get into costume. All right. The more I listen, the more he sounds like song danping. It's true. Mr. song, Mr. song. You saved my life just then. Thank you so much. Such enthusiastic applause! Of course. Remember, wait tomorrow on the stage at ten. I'll practice those high notes. Goodbye Mr. song! Bureau chief zhao, our troupe has great potential. Although it's small, they're young and talented. Mr. zhao, since you are on a cultural inspection tour... We hope you'll consider giving us financial support. Thank you. I've had enough, thank you. Sit over there, you. Stand up. Waiter! Give her sixty steamed buns. Yes sir. Right away, sir. Here they are, sir. She's got to finish the lot. Every last one. Hello, bureau chief zhao. Thanks. Eat up. You imitate song danping well. Yes. It's not imitation. It's my interpretation of the role. Wei qing, you really sound like song danping. Bureau chief zhao is right. Yes, yes. Wei qing, why don't sing something right now? And let bureau chief zhao give his opinion. I'm not a singsong girl. Forget it. Wei qing. Wei qing, don't be like that. I've an appointment. I'm going. Why don't you sing then? Mr. song, Mr. song. Mr. song, I'm here. Mr. song... Bravo! Bravo! You don't think I'm just copying song danping? Danping, what a silly thing to say. Du... du yunyan. Just now, people stood in the rain to hear you. They love you. Miss let's go home. Is it time to greet the elders then? I'll come see you another day. So, it was all a trade-off. You taught me Romeo's part so I could play you. Very good. You did extremely good just now. She clearly took you for me. You just need a bit more feeling. She hasn't been this happy in ten years. I've found you at last. You're not dead. Why not go to her yourself? I'm not doing this. If you renege, I'll kill you. You're as crazy as she is. You don't need me. You need a doctor. No doctor could help me. I once thought I was... The luckiest man in the world. I had my music, my theatre, my love. Then came that night. Mr. song? Uncle ma risked his life to save me. What? Uncle ma. Don't cry. Tell me. Speak to me. I considered suicide. But there's yunyan. I just couldn't. Every full moon night... She comes to hear me sing. My singing is her only comfort. What else can I do? What can I do? Mr. song, you're in a bad way. I'll leave you now. We'll take another day. Hold it there. Look. Look at me. Can I face her? I beg you. Stand in for me once more. But I don't know what to do. Give this letter to her. Yunyan. Danping! I'm nearly packed. I... have a letter for you. Come, sit down. Hurry. Sit down. Your letter. Open it. Read it to me. Open it? Okay. I'm sure it's very poetic. Read it. I'm dying to hear. I will. In a haze these ten years have passed, thinking of you, of all that is past, after such long separation, I see you at last. That's beautiful. I'll put it away. Let's go. I forgot to buy lipstick. Come with me. Hurry... Danping. She's still calling his name. Mad. Still crying for song danping. She can't forget song danping. Isn't that wei qing, the big star? Who's the woman with him? The madwoman. It's French perfume. Any lipstick, boss? - Miss... - Any lipstick, boss? Danping will pay. Danping! Danping! Miss du, just take it. I don't want your money. Danping will pay. Danping, come pay for me! Danping, pay for me. It's a gift. Just take it. Take it. Like it? Danping! Danping! Stop! Danping, come and pay for me. Danping... Who are you? What are you doing? Cheap slut. Bastard. Slut. I had you ten years ago. Look at you, you're a wreck of a woman. Stinking whore, feigning insanity. She slept with that lowlife song danping. Leave the cheap slut where she lies. Danping... Make way. Danping. Tonight I'll come see you perform. Fine. But don't you only come when the moon is full? Remember, wait at the usual place. All right. Miss... Were you running around again? What's wrong with you? She's fallen asleep. What are you doing? Gold-digger! Go with that bastard bureau chief then! Stop there. The troupe head begged me to dine with him. Who was the woman you were carrying anyway? I don't know. I saw an injustice, and jumped in to help. Everything I've done is above board and honourable. Wei qing! Leave me, I've an appointment. Don't stand there. Come over here. Hurry. Danping, kiss me. Miss du, I'm really not... You're not danping! You're not danping! Miss du... Miss du... Sir, I beg of you. Please don't hurt my mistress any more. Miss! I wanted you to play me. But not to take the role that seriously! Wake up to yourself. You think this proves your love for her? You're fooling yourself and deceiving her. Get out! Song danping, you're so selfish. You love no one but yourself. Since you hate yourself so much, why not end it all? Wei qing, hold it right there. What's with you? You mad? Forget it. I'm not playing "Romeo and Juliet". But tomorrow's performance is crucial. So many big shots are coming tomorrow. You'll have plenty of opportunities to sleep around then. Danping. You've come back at last. Danping. Danping. Don't go. Danping, danping! Wait up! Danping. It's me, yunyan! Don't go! Danping, you're really going to leave me? Danping... Yunyan. Get out! Romeo, go die for love of your Juliet. Miss du. Diel You'll pay - a life for a life. What'll we do, boss? Wei qing's still not back... Troupe head... It's my fault. Yesterday we had a row. I don't think he'll be back. Tonight's performance is crucial. The place is packed with vips. What'll we do? Wei qing's back. Wei qing's back. Wei qing, your face... A lot happened yesterday... It's hard to explain. I'm sorry. Arrest the suspect wei qing. Stop it. If anyone interferes, they'll be shot. I haven't done anything! You killed my son, and you'll pay. I didn't! No? Then who did? I did. Don't be afraid. I'm song danping. Everyone recalls the fire ten years ago. Everyone recalls the fire ten years ago. It was no accident. It was set by mr zhao and his son. They did it to stop me from loving du yunyan. For that, they'd killed me. I haven't dared to face her... These ten years. Yunyan went mad over me. Then, it's a life worse than death. I never imagined that today... You'd now come between wei qing and landie... To create a new tragedy. I can be silent no longer. Ladies and gentlemen... The real murderers are mr zhao and his son. Dad... Oh, my son! Quick, let him down. Forget it. It's all your doing anyway. Admit your quilt. Bastard! Stop speaking rubbish. Just shut up. Admit your crimes. Commander lu, would you protect murderers? Right. Execute him. Quiet, everyone. Please don't worry. I'm on the side of the law. Take him away. Ungrateful bastard! I helped make you a commander! Take him away. Is that you, danping? Yes. You've finally come back to me. I knew you weren't dead. I've done you wrong... Don't say that. But I fear I've lost my sight. You'll get better. I'll never leave you again. Not for the rest of our lives. - Our whole lives. - Yes? What are you looking for? Have you finished that song? Yes. Sing it for me. Yunyan died a year later. Danping was all alone after the death of yunyan and passed away in 1940.
