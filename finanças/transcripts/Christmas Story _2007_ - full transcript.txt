SNAPPER FILMS Presents A Film By JUHA WUOLIJOKI You all know who I am. We meet once a year, on Christmas Eve. But children and adults, young and old: I, too, have been a child. You don't believe it? Let me tell you a story. CHRISTMAS STORY Nikolas... Dear Nikolas. Aada has a high fever. We'll have to take her to the village. The firewood should last until we return. We'll be back when the little hand and the big hand are like that. We'll save time by taking a shortcut through the ice. Nikolas, you can finish Aada's present while waiting. Right? Where did you get the idea of giving presents at Christmas? Although it's a nice idea. Nikolas, we found your parents' tracks on the ice. The tracks lead straight into open water. I'm so sorry. Nobody wants to see an orphaned boy starve or freeze to death. Of course not. -We already have three children. It's the same thing with everybody. Fishermen's wives know how hard it is to make a living. And Nikolas... Why don't you cast him into the lake with his family? I can do that, if none of you is man enough. He scurried off. The little runt has no sense of humour. I have an idea. Kristiina and I can take care of him for a while. I've had fisherman's luck lately. We have some savings. I believe that we can feed an extra mouth. At least through the winter. I think that the whole village should take care of the boy. How many households do we have here? Four, five, six. Each household shall take care of the boy for a year - and then send him to the next house. I think that we can manage that. I'm not going to take part in that nonsense. You don't live here, Iisakki. It's not of your concern. Quit your yapping. We'll all take care of Nikolas. Beginning with the Hannuses. The boy will move to the next family on Christmas. Is this agreed? -Yes. Good. Merry Christmas, sister Aada. I could not forget my mother and my father - and my sister Aada. I knew they would not be coming back - but I missed them dearly. Thank you. But time heals the wounds - and by autumn the sadness began to fade away. My boat's broken. Fix it. -Ask your father. My father has gone fishing. -Ask your mother, then. Mother can't do it. -Give it to me. Turn, boat! -It won't turn! Why doesn't it come here? Turn right! There it goes! I didn't know it back then - but Eemeli would become a good friend. My best friend. Good throw. It bounced off the water. I found a great stone. -Stretch your arm back and throw. You can do it. One, two, three! Let's get another one. Then came the moment I had been dreading. I had to move to another family for the very first time. Are you sure you'll find your way to the Heinos? Bye bye. -Bye bye. Years, families and Christmases came and went. Every Christmas I carved presents - for the children of my former families. As the years passed, there were so many of them - that I had to deliver the presents to their front doors at night. It suited me fine - because I didn't want to make a great fuss about it. Instead, I acted ignorant - if someone came to thank me after Christmas. On my sixth year, not everything went as planned. That year was hard for the whole village. Early frost wiped out almost the entire crop. It was like the lake was empty of fish that year. No fish today either? -That's right, Hilla. That's a pity. If things didn't turn for the better - no family would be able to house me for the winter. Eemeli? What is it? It's Mad Iisakki. Run away! Get your homes in shipshape for Christmas! Scoops, ladles, cups! Spatulas, tubs and potato mashers! I have everything you need here! And if I don't have it, it can be made to order! Boy, come here. You haven't bought this from me. Are you buying things from other carpenters instead of Iisakki? A bad year. We have no money. We can barely feed ourselves. Where did you buy this? Answer me! I made it myself. -Don't lie, whippersnapper. And whose boy are you? -Nobody's. Oh yeah, you're the poor devil who is going around from house to house. Where are the others? -At the village meeting. What is so important that they must have a meeting? They're deciding what to do with me. They can't afford me. No wonder. You must be such a glutton - that you have ruined the village. And now I can't sell anything. You should've been cast into the lake. Get lost! But why? You don't like children. -He can help me at work. We know you, Iisakki. I was planning to shape that brat into a man within a year - but if my offer isn't good enough for you, there's nothing I can do. Wait, Iisakki. Maybe... Maybe we should consider it. There's nothing to consider. He'll be better off with me - than starving to death here in this poor village. Right? This might be the last time I can visit you. Iisakki lives so far away. Merry Christmas, little Aada. Nikolas, come and see! Nikolas. It's been six years since you were orphaned and came to us. At first I was sorry that we couldn't find you a family - to take you in. You had to go around from household to household, one year at a time. But now I believe that none of us have regretted it. We all have gotten to know you. And so, in a way, you are our child. And our brother. On behalf of all the villagers, especially the children - we want to give you a little memento. I can't... -Of course you can. The sledge belongs to you. Are you still loafing about? Get in the sleigh. Or you can walk the whole way. You're not going to cry, are you? Hilma, trot along home before night falls. What are you gawking at? Take Hilma into the stall. I'll go inside and light the stove. And leave this sledge in the stall. No mucking about here. You came here to work. Get up! And you sleep there. -But... No buts! Did you forget whose house this is? And you will call me master. -Yes. What? -Yes, master. Good. Your name is Brat. It suits you better than Nikolas. Take your bags in there. Move it! Wake up, Brat. Get to work. Let's get to the workshop. You go on ahead. Where's the workshop? -You're standing on it. What do you think? Take a look at this dresser. The secret is in the wooden inlays. It's made of maple. This is how I make money. Scoops and ladles are child's play compared to this. These will go to parsons, gentleman farmers and other wealthy people. This will go to a judge. -Is this chair going there too? It's made of pine, this is made of maple. Don't you recognise timber species? Maybe I made a mistake. You're no good as a carpenter. You haven't made a mistake, master. I'm a quick learner. A quick learner, eh? Let's see how quickly you learn to tidy up. Get on with it. Where are you going? -Upstairs. You don't need to go upstairs to tidy up the workshop. There's no need to clean up here... The workbench is covered with dust. If it gets mixed with varnish or stain, the whole work is ruined. Lesson number one: The workshop will be kept tidy at all times, no matter what. Lesson number two: Hand me your sheath-knife. You don't use this on my timber. Don't! -What? It was my father's. Take a decent sheath-knife from there. Go to bed. Remember to snuff out the candles. Why? -It has no branches. How can I find my things now? Master... A year has passed and I have to go soon - so I thought that I would thank all the villagers. Maybe I could take a day off? -No. When time is pressing - you don't waste time thinking, you work harder. A day off eh? What are you doing here? Why aren't you in bed? Have you stolen timber from me? -You threw it away, master. So this is what you do behind my back. I'm sorry, master. It isn't badly broken. Bring me the wood drill and a headless nail. Why are you working in the dark? It only results in duds and rejects. There. Now you can't tell it's broken. You have more toys somewhere, right? You must really like those little brats. Did you plan to slip out to deliver presents - because I didn't give you a day off? That's what I thought. Go on then - but remember to return before sunrise. We don't idle away, even though it's Christmas. Master... -Not a word. I may change my mind. You can build your toys in the evenings. I might even help you. At least now I can get some sleep. Building toys in the middle of the night... Humbug! Finally you showed up. I thought you had gone into hibernation. I already put your junk in the sleigh. What are you gawking at? You wouldn't have made it back before sunrise. The last workday would have gone to waste. Hop in. Let's go. That was the last house. -This is foolishness. I can understand why you do this, but an old man like me... Let's go home. -There's one more place. Hold on. Show me that. I made a horse like this when the boys were young. What boys? I had two boys, Hermanni and Henrik. And a wife, Marget. She died when the boys were about your age. Then they went to sea and left me all alone - because I had become like this. I see Henrik and Hermanni in all children. That's why I'm mean to children. I still miss my boys. What I mean to say is... You could stay with me. Merry Christmas, Nikolas. My father's sheath-knife. Thank you, master. From now on you can call me Iisakki. Merry Christmas, Aada. -Merry Christmas, Aada. Merry Christmas, Iisakki. -Merry Christmas, Nikolas. That's enough. Let's go. That Christmas changed everything. The village overcame the bad years. My vagabond life was over. Iisakki provided me a home that I didn't have to give up. Thank you very much. Good day to you. Hurry up! Good day to you. Come and buy a dresser! The years with Iisakki passed quickly. Before I knew it, I was all grown up, with a beard and all. The village had grown. There were so many new children - that me and Iisakki could not keep count. But we had a secret helper. Nikolas. -Eemeli. Long time no see. You should come more often. I've been busy. Iisakki is no longer young. Do you have the list? Well, I'll be... So many new children. As a matter of fact, one name is missing from that list. Elsa? Is that... -A girl, three months. Let's add her to the list. What is the name of this little princess? Aada. Aada? Hello, Aada. Nikolas, meet Henrik and Hermanni. My sons. I sought them out and asked them here. Yes... We were wrong when we... We want to make it up to our father. We came to take him to live with us. -To live with you? Where? Away from here. Father is too old to be living in arctic conditions. What about me? You'll get the house and the workshop. You've earned them. Wait, Nikolas. Nikolas... Nikolas, try to understand. Even though I love you like my own son... This key opens the chest under my bed. I've always been skimpy, maybe too much so. I think you can do better. Try to understand. Nikolas. Eemeli. -Nikolas. Hello. -Hello. Where have you been? -Here. Here! But everything is unfinished. These should last for ten years. This is barely enough for next Christmas. What is that? -A map. There, there... To this remote village, to these houses. There, there, there, there, there... Christmas presents. Christmas presents? -Yes. So many villages and children. How do you know who'll get what? There's a simple way. -What is it? I shall write names on the wrapping. Wrapping? -Ingenious, isn't it? How is all this possible? Iisakki's life savings. Now I can bring Christmas cheer to the children. Nobody can live just for Christmas. I've been selfish. I've only brought presents to those - who have helped me. -Selfish? From now on, I'm going to appear only on Christmas Eve. -Nikolas! I'll visit your shop once a year - to replenish my supplies and to get a list of new children. There's more to life than just Christmas. Like what? -It's an impossible task. You don't have room for all those presents. And Hilma won't be able to pull the load. It can't be done. -Yes, it can. Christmas is around the corner. -Animals are quick to learn. Reindeer are not horses. -Hilla, this is child's play. I can handle reindeer, dear. "Reindeer, dear." You can try. Reindeer obey me better when I'm wearing this colourful cap. Even the squirrels are afraid of such a garish colour. Reindeer would obey me even if I had a potholder on my head. I don't need any red caps. Okay, fall in line. Put your antlers down. Come to Nikolas, chop-chop. Dasher, Dancer, Prancer and Blitzen, your training begins. The first lesson... Lassoing. Dancer, behave yourself. Sit there! Sit! Sit! Stay! Dasher, if you don't behave, Nikolas will catch you! Prancer! Let's try again. Hold it! Dancer! Prancer! A red cap, a red coat... And frieze trousers to boot. What was the colour? -Red. Could you repeat that? Red! All right. I'll show you. Let's see, Aada. What do you have there? A spinning top. -That's nice. In a few years the mysterious present-bearer - became the staple of children's stories. Some swore to have seen elves bringing presents at Christmas. Others claimed that the presents were from a child-friendly gnome. Luckily, they didn't suspect me. Nikolas is coming! -Run away! Good day. Hello, Aada. Where are the others? -They are afraid of you. Me? Why? Mikko said that it's not you who brings us presents at Christmas. That you hate children. Is it true? -Mikko is half right. I don't bring presents. But I don't hate children, either. Who brings the presents? Who knows? Nikolas told me when I asked him. Aada claims that you don't bring us presents. Aada is right. Aada! Why did you say so? Tell her the truth. No way. Children must not associate me with the presents. It would ruin everything. -Why is that? One day you'll understand. Nikolas! -Eemeli? Is Aada here? -No. Aada has gone missing. -When? "Dear mother and father. Don't worry. I went to find out - who brings all the presents." We have to wake everybody up and arrange a search party. You must lend me some clothes. Otherwise I'll be exposed. Okay, boys. Hurry on home. Let's form groups of two. A torch and a lantern for each group. Aada couldn't have gone far. Let's hurry. I know where she is. -What did you say, Mikko? Aada wants to deliver you a present. Me? Why? -Aada doesn't believe that you don't bring us presents. Why didn't you tell us earlier? -I promised not to tell. Will Aada return? Aada! Aada doesn't know where you live. And even if she knew - she won't be able to walk that far. Aada! Aada! Nikolas? -Aada! Nobody thought that you'd manage to get this far. Twelve miles in a blizzard. How is it possible? It was nothing on a reindeer sleigh. -A reindeer sleigh? What reindeer sleigh? -Suddenly, a sleigh appeared. I thought it was you but the sleigh was empty... Well, not quite. I was cold so I put on your clothes. Then the reindeer brought me here. I told Aada everything. How I'd become the way I am - and why it was so important to deliver presents at Christmas. I even revealed my dream of continuing this tradition - when I would be gone. What kind of girl would Aada be now if she hadn't become a water nymph? Hopefully she'd be like you. Merry Christmas, Aada. -Merry Christmas, Aada. Merry Christmas, Aada. -Merry Christmas, Nikolas. Aada kept her promise. She didn't reveal my secret. Quite the opposite. He didn't look like Nikolas. He was a wrinkly old man - who called himself Christmas Codger. The years passed, and before I knew it - my friendship with Aada had lasted almost twenty years. Nikolas! Well? -I'm getting married. To Mikko? Nikolas, will you pick me up on Christmas morning? Of course I will. Hello. -Hello. Thank you. -For what? For everything. Everything. My father is dead. Fear of losing love is part of love. It's part of life. Your father... Eemeli taught me that. You have taught me how wonderful it is to give. Me? Nikolas, maybe you should think of yourself for a change. Nothing lasts forever. It was time for me to give in to my years. Next Christmas would be the last. My last Christmas. It's beautiful. Who is it for? Can I gift wrap it? -No. I want to do it myself. See you on Christmas morning. Are you sure you don't want any help at Christmas? Yes. I want to do my rounds alone. Nikolas, remember your promise. This is the last Christmas. This is the last Christmas. Nikolas? "Merry Christmas to little Aada. Your brother, Nikolas." What is the meaning of this? -We won't be seeing Nikolas again. What do you mean? -I can't explain. I just know it. What are you doing? There's no sense in doing that. Nikolas wanted this to continue. -No. A present for our Nikolas will disappoint other children. Other fathers have done this too... -It's not the same thing. Mikko, that's cheating. Mikko? Merry Christmas, little Aada. Merry Christmas, Nikolas. Dasher, Dancer, Prancer and Blitzen, ahoy! Merry Christmas!
