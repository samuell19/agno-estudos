Hi. Come in. Please don't. Hello? Mom? I'm working. Don't call me anymore. "Mr. chan, overall: Useless" What's up? I'm bored. No one asked you out on Sunday? Too many. They're either short on looks or brains or both. Don't be too picky. Different levels, hard to communicate. Don't expect too much... As long as they're physically normal. No commitment, no pressure. Thanks, I really don't need to go on paid dates. I'll send you some new guys. You like? They're so-so. Why don't we meet for a drink? Let's just be friends, you don't need to sway me. Any girls out there? I really need one tonight. Is silver available tomorrow? Silver quit long ago, how about lin? She's too wild, I want someone gentle but fun. Idiot. Got a client, you want him? No. Why are you so lazy lately? Miss, we are the police. Does miss wong ka-hei live here? Wait. I am she. You are? Do you know a girl named cheung shin-see? Her web name is silver. I don't know her very well. Her family reported her missing a month ago. According to her phone records, you called her even today. You don't know her very well? I can't find her either. You called but couldn't reach her. I see... We just want some information about her. Don't be nervous. No more TV if we don't install a digital receiver. We can watch anything on the net. Deeper... Don't stop... Harder... Deeper... Don't stop. Lift your skirt up for him. The new bag is available now, let's check it out. I don't want the same bag as the mainlanders. Didn't you know Ms. Gucci only buys limited editions? Sorry... Let's work in my room. What the hell? What are you doing in my room? We bought the computer together and I can use it anytime. You never paid for your half. Give me your share. I'm your brother. Give me some time. Get the hell out! What's your name? Caro. Don't talk to him. I used this hand. Pervert! He's not that bad. Your brother is a normal guy. Masturbating is better than seeing hookers. He's looking for paid dates. Paid dates are not as bad as call girls! How can you have such low standards? Let's work. Okay. This one is funny. Her voice is raspy, very sexy in bed. It drove me crazy. I filled the whole condom with cum. Stop reading that, let's work. Gucci, take a look. We don't have enough time to finish this. No, Gucci. What? Gucaci. It's the limited edition that you want! That's the one I want. Only 3 minutes left for the auction. Put in your bid. So many bidders today. Okay. Bingo. The bag is mine. Don't look at me, you know I'm broke. Miss kwan. I'm the one who won the bid for the bag. That bag, I... I want it for sure! No matter what... But I'm out of Hong Kong for 2 weeks. I'll close the deal once I come back. Thank you, bye. Faster. Come on. Hold it for 10 minutes... and you'll win. Okay. In a meeting, talk later, bye. Come on... Ten minutes, what did I win? What are you doing...? What are you afraid of? So expensive. The money you make from this is not enough. I'm really hungry. You have to call me more often. Your girlfriend is like a dead fish. Is it like making love to a corpse? Wait... Get out of the way... What is it? Let me see... You said get out of the way... What? I don't know. Let me check it. What? The soda spilled on the computer. Oh! No! Try this. It's useless! Don't you hear that? No... Sorry... Do you assemble computers? Yes, what is it for? Video games. Take a look. Getting a new computer? Do you have cheaper parts? No, that's the cheapest one. So expensive. You are an agent. Others make tens of thousands a month. You're always broke. Why? I know. Think it over. Thanks. I know I need more business. Have you seen my girl, silver? She seems to be missing. Silver? Why? Does she owe you money? Yes. I've been calling her but no answer. I told you to be careful. Not everyone treats you as a friend. What about you then? You just have a big appetite. Yeah... I'm gonna eat you too. You're sick. Your saliva, bitch. You're so tasty. Hello. Ronnie? Icy? Have a seat... Help yourself. She's lin? Bitch, talking behind my back? So? I should go. No, just stay for a while. We are not gonna eat you. Leave if you're scared. Go. I'm going. Call me. She's a character. Taiwanese hot chick. But she's nice though. Loyal to her friends. You guys come here often? Sometimes. Our flats are small so we hang out here. What about you? Where do you hang out? I just stay at home. Lucky for you, your parents are never home. You're so free. It's boring if you have too much freedom. Call me if you are bored. We hang out a lot. Because we all live in the housing projects. We smoke, drink and hang out... What kind of guys do you like? Last night, we called the police and reported a fire. All these handsome firemen came. All have great abs. Are you guys so wild all the time? Sometimes, it's fun. Come here more often, let's go out together. Okay? Okay. Eat. No, thanks. Want to be a paid date. How do I start? Put up your personal details. Put up your measurements, someone will contact you on msn. State your boundaries beforehand. Like no anal or sperm swallowing... Wear condoms... And get paid first. Some clients cheat. Okay, thanks. Gucci, 16 years old... No, gigi, 16 years old, 32-25-34. No looks, no figure, I'd rather jerk off. Don't think you can't be seen in the dark. Get a makeover. You guys are so critical, you must all be very handsome. Show us your pictures. Thanks, Ronnie. Can we be friends? Hi, gigi, I'm Ronnie. Hi, my real name is Gucci. Hi, Gucci. I'm curious... why are you doing this? I bid for a Gucci bag, and I need the money to pay for that. Do you get paid after sex or before? Do you get paid just for a date? No one ever called me, how should I know? I don't know anything. Are you still a virgin then? Don't be shy, you'll make a fortune if you are. "Virgin" "iv sells virginity" you're really a virgin? Try for yourself. How big are your breasts? Very small, 32a. Don't worry, they're enough to use. Virgin for sale, anyone want to try? How much? No thanks, if she's a pig. Av expert, you seem to be interested in that iv virgin. Anyone would be interested in a virgin. I'd like to try a virgin more than a threesome. She's the hottest thing on the net. Av expert, will you put in a bid? As an av expert, I'll leave that to young guys like you. Av expert... Let's meet tomorrow, I'll introduce you to a pro. "Great!" Icy, lin. Remember, if you can choose, you're the boss. She's calling for you. She's coming... Does it really hurt? Feels good more than pain. It's wide enough, don't be afraid. What? She said your ear hole is wide enough, it won't hurt. Is it really painful? Like a toothache or headache? Like a stomachache. Yours is as wide as a tunnel. Hello, j salon. Looking for jacky? No problem. Ronnie. Icy, yes? I found you a hot fireman lookalike. What? Hot fireman lookalike. Come on out. I don't want to be a paid date. It is compensated dating, but we're not sex workers. Don't be a prude. What's the difference? We only go shopping, watch a movie, eat... sex is not a must. You choose, not him. Come on... Ronnie. Hello. Sorry, I'm late. It's okay. Mam, Ronnie. Hi... Have a seat... where were you? I got the shoes for you. Really? Sure. As a gift? A gift. I wasn't going to take your money. I thought they didn't have my size? I asked them to send the right size over. So I got them. That's really vip treatment. Aren't you studying design? Yes. She's studying fine arts, that's a perfect match. Really? Woo her. Woo her? Talk to her. I mean talk to her. Communicate. Communicate, okay. Are you still studying? I'm almost done. "Any cheap paid dates? Mr. moss" you're back. You want the computer? Don't go on porn sites in my room. It's disgusting. I'll turn it off if you don't like them. Done, it's all yours. What have you been doing lately? You look so much hotter. Save it for your chicks, it doesn't work on me. This is a great look. If you weren't my sister, I'd be turned on. Don't be sick. Don't touch me. You should tie your hair up. You are as pretty as those young models. Don't smile with your mouth open. Right, that's more camera friendly. Gorgeous. Get out, I have to change. Try to dress up for tomorrow's shoot. What shoot? My friends are looking for a young model to shoot. I highly recommended you. You're not human. Selling your sister to take dirty photos. It's a way to get more experience. All the beauty pageant girls say that. Go to hell... get out. Why did you break up with your boyfriend? Do you go on paid dates often? Just shopping, movies, dinners, like this. I see. "How about $2,000?" "$4,000 to pop your cherry" "$5,300, please reply" "$6,300 for real virgin" "no negotiation, $10,000. Yin" le ja a a I 0 a le bi a. . En a oo / - ll.

Turn off the computer and prepare dinner. Okay. Dismembered body parts were found on a bus yesterday. It is believed that they belong to a young female. There are different theories as to why one of the victim's ears was placed in a ziploc bag. The police are looking for the victim's identity. Should anyone know... What's with you? Why were you like a dead fish just now? It's like making love to a corpse. I wanted to know what your girlfriend feels like. Was I like her? Why? I like you. Oh, no. Bro. What are you doing here? You have a date? Yes. Waiting for a girl? Yes... just go away. That means you've got money, pay me back. I don't have any. Going out with a girl doesn't mean I have money. Just go away... Then ask her to pay your debt. Take twenty dollars for the subway. Go home. Here's a few hundred, take a taxi home... Go... how dare you. That's not enough. It's so rude to snatch other people's money. You haven't paid me back. [You have my money, now go. I want more. I'm not hiding any money... just go. I'm not leaving, I'll wait with you. Please go away... Don't read it out loud, it's disgusting. You broke your appointments again? I don't know what she's thinking. She said they were okay but she didn't do it. What's the problem? I only have one chance in my life. I want to find a suitable guy. You're not looking for a husband. I'm not you, you said you would go out with that guy first. But you slept with him. Shush, I thought he was cute. I was excited by him, you won't understand. You liked him because he didn't French kiss you. You fell for him right there. I don't have any feelings for them. Lin said you're the boss if you can choose... you are not me. You need money, not feelings. Calm down, I'll help you to teach her. You're a big girl now. You have to know what you really want. Got it? Yeah, just speak directly. Don't be afraid. If you don't have time to find clients, I can help you. 25% for commission, but we're friends, there's a discount. You want a commission for her first time? We are friends, I won't charge you for your first time. But if you did it... You have to tell me. Hold this. $500. Thanks. Let's go eat. Come on, let's eat. What do you want to eat? You get paid to sleep with her, don't miss this, bros. The girl is hot. But don't expect good service. She's good in bed. Hot babe on the scene. Never thought I'd get paid for sex. She's one of a kind on the market. I want to try her too. News, money-sex goddess. She's my all time high. She won't see just anyone. Stop boasting about yourself. Sour grapes. You're jealous, I understand. She's beautiful and cool, try her soon. There will be a demonstration to defend the rights of prostitutes. I hope all of you will come and join us to defend your future. What are you talking about? Talking about sex to their face is to make them admit who they are. Hi, trade? Where? Special request, tsim sha tsui, a girl with period. Worth her while, $5,000. Hello? Lin. What is it? Are you menstruating? What m? The client wants a girl with m. I want m too... money... I'm busy tonight. Do you have your period? Don't you have your period? Yes and it hurts like hell. That's good. You want to buy the computer, right? You take it. Fine, bye. Bye. Prostitution is just a job. If you think sex workers are vain and pathetic... I have to go out. Okay. As soon as I became a prostitute, I was alive and kicking. All my clients enjoyed my company. After sex, I took my fellow workers out to eat and play. I made money and had fun. Which job is better than being a prostitute? Then my asshole boyfriend forced me to quit so I became madam coco. I really want to be a prostitute again. I'll shower first. No. I'll give you $200 more. You have to pay extra for kissing. How much for using handcuffs? $2,000. Let go of me. What are you doing? What did you do? You filmed it? Go away... give it to me. I paid you. I'll give it all back. Don't want it, bitch. Don't pretend to be pure. Be smarter next time. What are you going to do? Give me my glasses. What? It hurts? Have a rest. I can't let chun know about this. It's better if he knows. You should've left him long ago. What's wrong? Why is she crying? It's your fault. You screwed up everything. What's going on? You're the cause of it all. You've messed it all up. What did I do? You gave money to clients. What's wrong with that? It's fine for you because you're rich. But for us, we don't have money. Icy had to take a client. I didn't force her. You think you're different? You're a whore too. I always give you a commission. If you're too good for us leave! Get out! I didn't ask you to give them money. You're rich, we're not. Go! Let's go. What happened? Tell me. Someone filmed icy. Hey! Let go. Speak up. You assault a police officer but you can't talk? I'm a cop. Ptu. If you let me go, I'll forget about this. I'll keep my word. Let me go. I'm a cop. No. I recognize you. What? Gucci, film this. It's more fun with the police. It's not too late. Let me go... if this gets out, he'll be in bigger trouble. Let go of me. Police? Big deal. Speak up. Pervert cop. If you don't kill me now, I'll come for revenge. Revenge. I filmed it to protect myself. Use a condom to protect yourself, not a camcorder? You might blackmail me or set me up. I'm setting you up now. What's you pin? You'll be filmed at the atm machine. This guy is a pervert, he might be the psycho-killer. No one would know if we killed you, pt... Then kill me. You love blood so much... Icy! Let me... Bastard! Pin. What's the pin number? 172210. Give us your address. Come over here. Wow. Learn something. Stop playing, get to it. Here... Found it... icy. Delete it. What now? Open the window. We're fine again. Thank you. What is it? Au bun. I'm not sure I want him, but I want the apartment for sure. Shut up! Bitch! Go. Help yourself... Bro. Paid dates are like prostitution on the Internet. I wish teenagers in Hong Kong would arm themselves with positive values and not sell their bodies for money and material goods. Silver? Where have you been? The police are looking for you. Have you got money? Help me. What's going on? Silver. What happened? Still up? Had a nightmare? What's wrong? Sorry. It's not what it seems... What is it like then? I don't mind you being an agent, why are you doing this again? I listen to you and stay at home every day. What do you want? Let me explain... sorry. Chun, sorry... Listen to me. I wanted to buy you a computer. I know. I feel more useless. No. I'm so sorry. Chun, please don't go. I... we... Let's play a video game. No. Chun. Miss wong ka-hei, we've found cheung shin-see. She was murdered. We could only find her body parts. We suspect that it's related to compensated dating. We need your computer for our investigation. "Au bun has unfriended you" Hello, miss kwan. It's me, I'm the buyer of your bag. I'm sorry, I'm still in the mainland. No, of course not. Give me one more week, I'll be back soon. Lin. Icy. Have you got any clients? Forget it, I'll find one myself. We have money these days. You should stop for a while. I'm not doing it for money. Lin. Forget it. Bros, what would you charge to pop iv's cherry? $5,000? At least $100,000. I'm asking for one million. I'm fair, $1 per sperm. Then you're asking for 100 million? You're all vicious. I want to die. You're young and beautiful, why do you want to die? Mom, I'm busy I'll call you later, bye. I'm upset. Even if you're upset, don't be ai lijima. If I were her, I wouldn't want to die. You should read her autobiography before you die. Before you die, don't waste your virginity and give it to me. Are you an animal? Just don't be foolish. Thank you for comforting me. You're welcome. You'll still be here, even if you're not a virgin anymore. Y Open the door. I'll show you what real fun is. No. Please, don't... Double the pleasure. Please, don't... Mr. aids? Phone numbers for my paid dates... Here are the numbers for the girls I slept with. See if you slept with them too. Mind your health, brothers. Do you have the aids list? What?! I got it too! Me too. Get tested now. Hello? Hello, Ronnie? You on there too? Must be an old client. What about lin? I can't find her. Hello, lin. Icy. What is it? I need to ask you... Can I go to your place? Wait for me at the stairs of hillwood road. Lin. Icy. What? I don't know how to say it. I'm scared. Today... I... I understand. In fact, Ronnie and I... Don't worry, I'll find that Mr. aids. Mr. aids? Well? No. How about you? Hey? Mr. moss? He was useless. What about that one? Au bun! He used to see icy. He might be Mr. aids. Not him. Wait. How do you know? Sorry. I didn't know it would turn out like this. You didn't know? Or you don't want us to know? Stop that, lin. You pass him to us after you're finished. You passed him to Ronnie too, didn't you? You want us to enjoy together or die together? Stop that! Calm down. It's none of your business. My brother is Mr. moss, he slept with you too. Lin. Sorry. Shut your mouth. You're good for nothing. Go to hell. "If I could choose again..." "I would be more careful picking clients." Guarantee no aids, no pervert. Goodbye. Icy. Hello, this is icy. I can't take your call right now, please leave a message. What is it? Lin. I can't find icy. Do you know where she lives? Icy? No one knows where she lives. She's missing. Gucci. Av expert, can you do me a favor? Absolutely. Find icy for me, please. Looking for icy. Have you got her picture? Yeah, I'm sending it to you. My primary school classmate. Primary school classmate? I probably have her address in the yearbook. So long ago? She's moved. I know her boyfriend. We used to play an online game together. Her boyfriend and I are in the same association. Just check the ip. I found her. Her name is wong ka-hei, 19 years old. She lives on 4/f, 52 granville road in tsim sha tsui. This one? Is it this one? This one. This way. Ley... Ley... icy, open the door... Ley... Is she in? Ley... Icy, open the door... Try crashing in... Icy. Icy. Hey. Stop that, okay? I'm getting weapons for chun. Let go of me! Why did you hit me? Let go! What is it? Here are your ID cards. I'll get tested with you guys. I'm going for a smoke. Hey, mom. Are you busy? Nothing special, just calling because I have some time. How's grandma? Let's tell each other what we really want to do but haven't done yet so we can complete each other's wishes if someone gets it. I must have that Gucci bag. If we don't die, we'll buy it for you. If anything happens to me... Could someone take care of chun for me? And buy him a computer too? I want to find someone to love me. If I die... I want all of you by my side. I don't want to die alone. If I die, I want to die here. Even if you have aids, you won't die tomorrow. Death is easy. Maybe someone would throw acid at us from up there and fry us all. Why should we be scared of this report? Yeah, what are we scared of? Let's throw it away. Let's do it. One, two, three! You said throw it away. You really did it. It's on top of that bus. Let's go and get it. The bus is leaving. Forget it, you are probably fine. I've known silver for over a year. We were casual friends. We'd hang out sometimes. But we didn't talk much about ourselves. I just know that she used to be broke. I didn't charge her commission a few times. But she even borrowed more money from me. I didn't lend her money and she disappeared. You know what? My previous name was Agnes b. I changed it to Gucci last year. I think we should upgrade ourselves. At least I didn't call myself hermes. I know my place. Anyway, the most important thing is not to be outdated and keep up with the trends. "See you Saturday, tsim sha tsui?" I just want someone to love me. My only criteria is that person be a man. Someone to eat and hang out with. That's what I want. Just the two of us. An ordinary couple. I want to go back to Taiwan to see my mom. I miss her. When I got aids... I wanted to cry. I wanted to tell her that I missed her, but I couldn't. I'll go back to see her when I have time... And we can have a meal together. If I can choose one more time, I'll choose my boyfriend. I love him, because... He loves me much more than I love myself. Gucci? You are...? Av expert. How old are you? Thirteen. Where should we go then? Let's go eat, okay? Yeah. How have you been? Their world is... So real, so close to life, with immediate emotions and more laughter. Something I don't have. We did a test. It made us look at ourselves clearly but the price was very high.
