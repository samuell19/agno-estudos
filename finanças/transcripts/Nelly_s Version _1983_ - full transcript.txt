[music playing] NARRATOR: She admired her own coolness as she gave a false name and address. She had read it in so manythrillers and was now doing it herself. Thank you. I hope you have a pleasant stay. Number three. NARRATOR: On the spur of the moment, she signed Mrs. Nelly Dean. Really, it was quite easy. Thank you, ma'am. When Mr. Dean arrives,I'll show him up, shall I? Mr. Dean? Thank you, but I'm not expectingMr. Dean for a day or two. I'm expecting a telephone call. NARRATOR: Her whole manner and the way the lines came out pat wasthe performance of her dreams. She actually had no idea whoshe was, why she was there, or what the future held. Was the money in the suitcase hers? If not, how had she obtained it? Would her past catch up with her? Was the choice of hotel significant? She decided it was betternot to think about it and enjoy her new freedom. It was like meeting a character in a novel and waiting for the authorto reveal their destiny. Can I help you? I doubt it. Did you ever sell ices? Oh. That sign, has it been here long? I only work here. Oh, it's you again. What do you want? I'd like a notebook. - What kind? - Oh, I don't mind. Anything. This is the cheapest. No, that won't do. I wanted something larger. - Larger? - Yes. I don't know what I'm going to write yet, but it must have a lot of blank pages. A lot of blank pages. That's the best. The advantage is you can tear out pages if you make a mistake. In a school exercise book, if you tear out a page in the front, you lose one at the back and vice versa. It's amazing how the teacher always noticed the missing pages. They were delighted if you'd made a mistake. I see what you mean. I think that will do very nicely. Anything else? I suppose I'd better have a pen. Well, you'd better try it. Fine. Do you sell newspapers? Yes, but they've all gone by this time. You could place an order. I'll bear it in mind if I decide to stay. You haven't been here for some time. No. Your memory is going. We've always sold newspapers. Yes, you're right. It is bad. You should have left years ago. I suppose when your fatherwanted you to help in the shop, it never occurred to you to object, did it? You never thought you had a choice, did you? How dare you speak to me like that? Who do you think you are? You gave in all along the line, didn't you? Afraid of blotting your copybook, of irritating teacher? Always resigned and obedient,you mistook that for duty. Do I know you? I know you, don't I? I do know you, don't I? Do you recognize yourself? No. This one was taken on thelast day of summer term. Most of us wouldn't be comingback for the following term. What's all this got to do with me? Why do you keep all this trash? Oh, I know they don't mean much to you, but it's different for me. If you don't hold on to these things, how do you know who you are? I don't know. "The sky weeps for the death of a bird. The trees drip melancholy. God's tears run down the window pane"-- How utterly appalling,I've never had such tripe. How can anyone be so naive and foolish? You wrote it. I did not. You've got me confused with someone else. You always were a liar. NARRATOR: She was badly shaken by the encounter with the shop assistant. Were they in fact at school together? And why, without thinking, did she find herself saying things that seemed to confirm the assistant'simpression that she knew her? She decided that it was clearlya case of mistaken identity. She resolved, in the future, not to say whatever came into her headwithout considering it first. Are you the angel of death? No, I'm a brush salesman. Do I look so bad today? Stomach's playing me up. Oh, I'm sorry. I must have mistaken you for somebody else. Maybe you should have stayed in bed. Can't afford to. Got to keep on the move. Could you direct me to Maiden Lane? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a stranger here myself. Oh, well, I expect I'll get there in the end. We all do, don't we? There won't be another train for 20 minutes. What train is that? The up-train. The down-train's a quarter to. Where does it go, the up-train? Wherever you want. It's all a matter of connections. Mrs. Dean, there's agentleman waiting to see you. Are you sure? There must be some mistake. I'm quite sure, madam. Did he give his name? No, madam. But he's waiting in the bar. The bar? I told him you were out,but he wanted to wait. The gentleman seems quite happy in the bar. In that case, I'll freshen up first. Thank you. Mrs. Dean? Could I have a word with you? Perhaps we could go somewheremore private, bit quieter? Why? Detective Inspector Leach. NELLY: Do you have a warrant? LEACH: Of course not. So you haven't come to arrest me? LEACH: I don't think that'll be necessary. I don't suppose you would cause any trouble. I wouldn't be sure, if I were you. I understand you arrived today. NELLY: Why do you ask? LEACH: You know Ms. Wyckham? No, I don't. LEACH: She runs the newsagents in the High Street. Oh, is that her name? LEACH: So you do know her? I had met her this afternoon. When you left her, how was she? NELLY: Well, how do you mean? Did she seem nervous? No, of course not. Why do you ask? What is all this? LEACH: She was violently assaulted this afternoon and is in the hospitalwith severe head injuries. Oh, how awful. Is she badly hurt? LEACH: I'm afraid so. She's at Saint Quentin's. Ward 5, when you go to visit her. Oh, no, you misunderstandme, Inspector. I hardly know her. She seemed to take it into herhead that we were old friends. Well, Ms. Wyckham wasable to give us a statement. She remembers your visit, an old friend she hasn't seen for years. But that's all. I went into the shop by pure chance. To the best of my recollection, I've never seen her before in my life. Quite frankly, I don't see how I can help you. The attack happenedshortly after your visit. Did you see anything suspicious? NELLY: Nothing at all. Did you talk to anyone? A man. He asked me the way to Maiden Lane. LEACH: Could you describe him? We had an odd conversation. He told me he was a brush salesman. Odd. NELLY: What? Being a brush salesman? Could be. It's an outdated profession. And then Ms. Wyckham lives in Maiden Lane. Are you staying long? I don't know. LEACH: Perhaps you'd begood enough to get in touch if anything else comes back to you. Of course. NELLY [VOICEOVER]: I must write. Write, but what? I know nothing. Nothing. But I must write. No memories, no past, no understanding, only the imagination. Imagination, too risky, can't control it. Keep to the facts. The facts, write everything down. Keep a record. Give it coherence. My dear, I bought you some flowers. Aren't they lovely? Who are you? Why have you come here to persecute me? NELLY: I was concerned about you. I shall call the nurse. My dear, you must put it all behind you. Treat it like a bad dream. Past is best forgotten. That's what I think. No. Why should I? We used to be so happy. And you will be again. You can say that, but youdon't know what it's like. There's nothing, nothing at all. Nothing. NELLY: You'll feel better about it-- How dare you patronize me? You're evil, pure evil. Get out. Get out. Nurse? Nurse. NURSE: Now, now, nothing's the matter-- MS. WYCKHAM: Call the policeand have this woman arrested. I think you had better go now. Everything's going to be all right. It's OK. [whimpering] Shh, shh, shh. This will make you go to sleep for a little bit. Shh, shh, shh. Hello, there. NELLY: Hello. Can I help you? I don't think so. We were very sorry tohear of the old man's death. Nobody came to see him, hardly had any visitors. No doubt you all have your own life to lead. You going to live here now? Why? MAN: It's been standing empty for far too long. It makes me nervous living down here alone. I've begun to imagine I can hear things, noises, like someone creeping about. NELLY: Well, what do youexpect me to do about it? MAN: That's for you to do so. But it's our time it was occupied, otherwise it's going to rack and ruin. Lowers the tone of the neighborhood, brings down property values. What sort of noises? What kind of game are you playing? You can't get rid of me. You're trying to prove I'm mad, aren't you? But you can't catch me that way. I'm not saying anything. Oh, no, you misunderstand me. I'm not talking. I'll call the police. NELLY [VOICEOVER]: It's a conspiracy. I can see no other explanation. Victim of a massive conspiracy. Deploys vast resources, extensive planning, fiendish ingenuity, infinite cunning. Be more vigilant. [phone ringing] Take every precaution. Take every precaution. Yes? WOMAN [ON PHONE]: Mrs. Dean,Mr. Leach is here to see you. Leach? WOMAN [ON PHONE]: I thinkhe's, um, with the police. Oh, yes. Tell him I'll be right down. How are you enjoying your stay here? Very much indeed. It's very pleasant here. Do you find you have enough to do? Oh, yes. Reading, taking it easy, goingfor walks, you know how it is. You were out today? Yes. As a matter of fact, I went to look at a house that's for sale. LEACH: To pass the time? No. I'm thinking of buying a house in the area. And will you by the one you saw? It has possibilities. But I'd like to look at afew more before deciding. I don't think you'll be interested in that particular one. It was gutted by fire shortly after you left. I see. What started the fire? It's too early to say exactly. It's odd. The house has just beenstanding empty for a long time. So the possibility ofarson can't be ruled out. Who would want to do that? Kids causing mischief, trampdrunk on meths, even squatters. Did you go over the whole house? No, no, not the whole house. As a matter of fact-- Thought of something? Well, yes. There was a man I spoke towho seemed distinctly odd. In what way odd? NELLY: I don't know, not quite right in the head. He seemed resentful somehowabout the place being empty. Is the house badly damaged? It looks as if it'll be a total write off. Really? That's bad for the owners. On the contrary, it's beenon the market a long time now. They dropped the price, butstill aren't attracting buyers. Since it's insured at the full asking price, well, I don't think they'llbe shedding many tears. Do you? If you decide to leave, youwill leave a forwarding address where you can be contacted. Is everything satisfactory, Mrs. Dean? - Absolutely. - But the suitcase? Madam isn't checking out, is she? Of course not. I'd have informed you. Would you like me to telephone for a taxi? Well, I was going to-- yes, please. Where would you like the taxi to go to? In to town. My suitcase? Oh, yes. [knocking] Come in. Hello, Mrs. Dean. Take a seat. You asked to see me? You are the manager? Forcett, the assistant manager. The manager's away at the moment. What can I do for you? I'd like to put some money in the bank. FORCETT: You mean you'd liketo open an account with us? Yes, that's right. Normally, the bank requires references. Purely as a safeguard, you understand. Well, that's rather awkward. You see, I'm anxious to deposit some money straight away, for safekeeping. I won't be requiring an overdraft. How much money, may I ask? I think we can dispense with the references. [knocking] Come in. Thank you. We make that 119,740 pounds. That's correct. The account to account checkbook should be ready shortly. Do you like living here? Depends on what you want. It's very peaceful, quiet, and clean, but nothing ever happens here. Really? I had there was a fire only the other day. FORCETT: I mean it's not aplace to get on in the world. People commute to where theaction is, but women like it. And I suppose you can't blame them. Good for bringing upchildren, quiet and peaceful. NELLY: Are you sure? I heard a woman nearly gotmurdered only the other day, just up the road from here. It's all too slow. Mortgage, girls down from private schools. I'm committed up to thehilt for the next 20 years. NELLY: Oh, it's not so bad. You probably need a break. Most of us do from time to time. I need something. NARRATOR: She slept badlyand had recurring dreams. She could not decide what, if anything, these dreams were supposed to mean. You heard about the robberyin the town, Mrs. Dean? NELLY: No, I haven't. Thousands of pounds are missing. NELLY: Thousands? Can you believe it? The bank in the town. Was anybody hurt in the process? No, inside job. They've caught him? Well, not yet. It's the assistant manager,just disappeared over night. Do they know why he did it? It's his wife I feel sorry for. Had no idea what was going on, hasn't heard or seen from him since. Fancy disappearing with all that money and not leaving her a penny. Maybe she's really in the know, who's going to join him whenall the fuss has died down. MAID: Not that sort of person. No, he's gone for good. Unless they catch him. NARRATOR: A growing feeling of nemesis, bringing trouble andretribution was now confirmed. [thunder] She decided it would be safer to confine herself to the hotel for a while. After the first few days, shebecame used to eating alone and would study the other guestsand eavesdrop on conversations. MRS. KNATCHBULL: I hoped therewould be a letter from my son today. That's why I stayed in my room all morning. I see. MRS. KNATCHBULL: Hepromised he would visit me. I hoped he could manage this weekend. Well, that would be nice. Would madam like to order? It's too bad of him not to let me know. What? Oh, I'll have the usual. Hello, Mother. Good afternoon. Who are you? I don't think we've been introduced. Surely you know your own son? I know no such thing. You don't remind me of anyone at all. Nobody at all? I was about to take a walk. Now you're here, you'd better come with me. Weather's quite good, don't youthink, for the time of year? We've all been worried about you, Mother. Really? It's very nice of you, but I can't think why. There's absolutely no reason. And even there was, why should it worry you? Don't play games with me, Mother. This is serious, what you've done. Oh, but I'm not playing games. I'd genuinely like to knowwho you are and what you do. I'm David and I work as anexecutive, as you well know. Really? Is that Interesting? What, or should I say whom, do you execute? I didn't come to talk about my career. What's the big idea, Mother? Do you know, I find you rude,if not downright offensive, young man. I don't know what possibleclaim you can have on me, or what makes you think youhave any right to speak to me at all, let alone in that tone. Why on earth should I claimto be your son if I'm not? It doesn't make any sense. Course it does. You're an imposter. Don't be ridiculous. I could bring photographsof us together. Mm, sure you could. And you still wouldn't believe me? Of course not. Do you think I'm naive? It's perfectly obvious thatyou're a confidence trickster. I suppose I should have understood. You've been under a strain recently. I didn't think. Too preoccupied with myown problems-- the house, things have been a bit difficult with Susan. Susan? Susan is my wife and your daughter-in-law. Mm. I'm sure she's very nice. DAVID: Looks very comfortable here. It is. I suppose it must be quite expensive. How are you managing for money, Mother? There you are. At last, you've come out with it. It is my money you're after. How can you say that? You know it isn't true. I wasn't born yesterday. I know all about your sort, vultures, picking on well-to-do women living alone, claiming to be long lost relatives, taking them into their so-called families and bleeding them of all their money. Well, you may be very clever,but in choosing this victim, you've made a big mistake. I'm no lonely or gullible old lady, so you can just go away and leave me alone. Don't you think you should see a doctor? Oh, go away. Well, goodbye. I'll come and see you again soon. Enjoy your walk. MS. WYCKHAM [ON TV]: You haven't been here for some time, have you? NELLY [ON TV]: No. MS. WYCKHAM [ON TV]: Your memory is going. NELLY [ON TV]: Yes, you're right. It is bad. MS. WYCKHAM [ON TV]: Do I know you? I know you, don't I? You know, I get tired ofwaiting for this to stop. Nothing to do in this dampthat's bad for my rheumatism. NELLY [ON TV]: And this blue gown, laughing amongstourselves, pretending we're waiting to be asked to dance. Of course, we were all keen on someone then. You, I think, had ahopeless crush on somebody called Charles Wilson. MS. WYCKHAM [ON TV]: How did you know that? NELLY [ON TV]: It wasn't hard to guess. Your eyes following him all around the room. MS. WYCKHAM [ON TV]: Yes. You know, I haven't seen you for so long, I didn't recognize you. NELLY [ON TV]: Oh, you're mistaken. MS. WYCKHAM [ON TV]: Of course,I realize how it must be coming back after all these years. NELLY [ON TV]: No, you're mistaken. I've never been here before.You don't know me. MS. WYCKHAM [ON TV]: Come, come now. MRS. KNATCHBULL: When we wereyoung, we didn't expect much and got less. If we were sometimes unhappy, it's nothing to what will come now. People demand and expect too much. Now, I only see ruined fireand brimstone, death and decay. MS. WYCKHAM [ON TV]: "God's tears run down the windowpane"-- NELLY [ON TV]: How utterly appalling. I've never heard such tripe. How can anyone be so naive and foolish? MS. WYCKHAM [ON TV]: You wrote it. Your memory is going. NARRATOR: She watched theold lady, Mrs. Knatchbull, waiting every day for news from her son. She wondered if David, whohad claimed to be her son, had somehow mistaken Mrs. Knatchbull for her. Mind if I join you? Oh, no. Do. Something was amusing you? Oh, not really, just an idle thought. Wilkinson. I beg your pardon? My name, George Wilkinson. The name mean nothing to you? No, I'm afraid it doesn't. Should it? Forgive me, my memory'sterrible when it comes to names. Well, what about my face? Well, what about it? Do I know it? I mean, are you famousor have we met somewhere? I'm sorry, I'm just as bad when it comes to faces. Excuse me, your-- your coffee, madam. Oh, thank you. Sir? A large cognac, please. Will you join me? - Oh, thank you. I'd like that. Please. Are you staying here long? We'll see. It depends on how things go. I understand. Have you? Been staying here long? Yes. Yes, quite a while. It's very comfortable here. Yes, it seems to be. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Cheers. Your very good health. And yours. How is it? Oh, the brandy, it's very good. GEORGE: No, no, I mean, how's your health? NELLY: Splendid. Why? Do I look unwell? GEORGE: No, not at all. You look in splendid health. I simply assumed that youwere staying in this place for health reasons, thatperhaps you had been ill. No. No, I have never felt better in my life. Are you sure the nameWilkinson means nothing to you? I'm sorry, but I reallyknow very little about what's happening in public life. I'm sure we will find it mucheasier to be friends if I didn't know how famous you are. That's not what I meant at all. I caught one. I caught one. Pull it in. GEORGE: You know, you're a very attractive woman. Really? Beautiful. Your face isn't ordinary. You It's lived, has character, experience. - I don't know about that.- Oh, it has. You take it from me. I think you're a very remarkable woman. Now, I'm not just flattering you. I know what I'm talking about. Let's assume what you're saying is true. It is. Would you say then that you're a remarkable man? Well, I-- I'd say I have my points. And they are? Reliable. I'd say I was reliable. And I'm considerate, understanding. Understanding about what? Understanding about you. I doubt it. But if you are, then you are quite remarkable. Perhaps. Mm, perhaps. [music playing on radio] Recognize the music? Bach. Yes. Bach. Ever seen it performed? I think so, yes. I have a vague recollectionof a concert once. Have you? Yes. Our wedding anniversary. Well, that must be nice. It was. Marvelous evening. We have walked down the aisle together. [laughter] Well, maybe the future is unpredictable, but we ought to know what happened yesterday. I don't see why. Yesterday's gone for good. It's over, finished with. Who knows what tomorrow will bring? That's very knew of you. It doesn't matter? Doesn't add up to anything? That's right. Well, I can understand youmay not be interested in what's happening in the world outside, but what about your personal life? I mean, everybody holds onto their own pasts. Do they? Well, where would any of us be without pasts? Who knows? Here, perhaps. Nelly, darling, you are incorrigible. [laughter] [moaning] NARRATOR: George never spoke to her again, suddenly getting dressedand leaving without a word. Later, she discovered he checkedout first thing in the morning. Why did he behave like that? She assumed that it was notthe first time it had happened. And they had drunk a lot. She supposed that she wouldnever understand his behavior. What did you want to bewhen you were a little boy? Fighter pilot. Very annoyed that I was born too late. I think I never forgave you. You don't how lucky you are. People get killed during wars. I suppose I wanted to prove myself. Don't all little boys? It's, uh, a what-not complex,you know, trying show you're as good as your father. You said something about your father. Yes. I'm sorry. Didn't mean to bring it up, slip of the tongue. Let's forget it, shall we? NARRATOR: Once she became used to David, he seemed a pleasant enough young man. She agreed to meet his wife and children. There we are. Hello. Hello. Look who's come to see you. What's your name? Darcy. And what's your name? Come on, Lewis. Lewis. That's right, Lewis. Do you know what my name is? No. Yes, you do. You know what your granny's name is. I'll tell you. It's Nelly. That's a nice name, isn't it? NELLY: How old are you? CHILDREN: Four. NELLY: You're both three. CHILDREN: Yes. And when will you be four? CHILDREN: Nearly. Nearly. And what's going to happen? And we're going to have a new baby, aren't we? SUSAN: That's right. Then you can play with her. DAVID: And what are you goingto do with the new baby? What I would do is bath her and-- and smack her baby's bottom and-- Oh, will you? And never put-- get her babyout and put it down the plug. Put the baby down the plug? Yeah. SUSAN: Is that what you're going to do? DAVID: You little rascal. SUSAN: Well. The garden-- Oh, the garden. The garden's looking so lovely. But I find the hotel perfectlyacceptable and pleasant. But the house is waiting, ready for use. Then move into yourselves. Or sell it if you can. SUSAN: Well, it's your house, Mother. And everybody would be so much happier if you stayed there yourself. An empty house becomes a liability. It gets run down, as wellas being an open invitation for burglars and squatters. You'd be your own master there, not responsible to anyone. I'm my own master here. DAVID: Why don't you try it for us? Just a few days, to begin with. If you don't like it, you can always move back into the hotel. I don't think it's necessary. SUSAN: Please, Mother, as a favor to us. We do have your best interests at heart. All right then, for your sakes. I'll try it for a few days, see how I like it. Wonderful, Mother. Thank you. DAVID: I'm sure you won't regret it. And you can begin to startto live a normal life again. Here we are, Mother. Home. [footsteps] Hello, Mrs. Wilkinson. I heard you were back. What are you doing? MAID: I'm washing up. What on earth for? What do you mean? NELLY: Well, I'm perfectlycapable of doing that. For five years, I've been working for you. If you don't want me anymore, just say so. Oh, no, no, no. I didn't mean that. I'm sorry, Mrs. Wilkinson. You've been sick. I've been perfectly well, thank you. Would you like a cup of coffee? NELLY: Please. After coffee, what wouldyou like me to do for you? NELLY: What do you normally do? Today, I change the beds, clean upstairs. It all seems clean to me. MAID: I don't understand? Well, it doesn't matter. Do you do this as well? MAID: Yes. Part of the job. Don't you want me to? We'll see. It's quite soothing. No problems, Mrs. Wilkinson. [footsteps] Hello, there. Hello. I've, uh, been abroad. Business trip. Successful? Very. Much better than we ever expected. How'd it feel to be home? I'm glad you're back again. You? I didn't know what to expect. But I wasn't expecting you. Well, now that you know, what do you think? What do you want of me? I want you to be my wife again. You do realize that Idon't know what that means? GEORGE: Well, of course, I understand what's happened to you,how you are, your memory. But I think we ought totry to get together again. What do you think? Yes. I suppose we must work something out. GEORGE: No, no, no. It will only work if you want it to. Welcome home. Would you like a drink? Oh, that would be very nice. No. No, I don't think so. What? Oh, I see. [laughter] Well, yes. I understand now. Fine. Fine. Well, thanks for clearing it up. I'll see you in the morning. Yes. Good night. Sorry about that. I just had to sort somethingout for the morning. Well, I keep saying it,but I'm glad you're back. I hope it's what you want. As I'm here, I suppose it is. Suppose? Under the circumstances,it's an act of faith. [laughter] Oh, yes. Under the circumstances, I suppose it is. Here's to it. Excuse me. I want you to meet Douglasand Patricia McKenzie. Douglas is with the church commissioners and Patricia has madeone of the most beautiful gardens in the country. Are you very religious then? Oh, not very religious, no. I'm a surveyor. I deal with their properties. - Churches? - Rarely. We have a lot of residentialand business properties. Is it profitable? Well, we don't like to look at it like that, but we need the income for administering the church, stipends, upkeepof property, education-- I see, a sort of the Lordtaketh, and the Lord giveth. [laughter] You must excuse me. I want a word with David. Nice to have met you. We must talk. To want to hear all about your garden. GEORGE: Well, what do you think? PATRICIA: She seems very well indeed. GEORGE: Yes, apart from not recognizing you, possibly her oldest friend. PATRICIA: George, darling, don't worry. You warned us all. The main thing is she's back and seems happy. [knocking] Come in. [door closing] [door closing] [door closing] [moaning] Hey, there, Nelly. Oh, it's been a right bloody day. MAN [ON TV]: Doctor told me not to smoke in the-- GEORGE: I need a drink. What about you? NELLY: Yes, I'll join you. WOMAN [ON TV]: You're right. I'm not an analyst, not even a doctor here. I'm not talking to you as one. But believe me, not what I say, but what I feel. The mind isn't everything. The heart can see deeper sometimes. You, yourself, taught me what Freud says. A man can do anything inamnesia that his real character wouldn't have done. MAN [ON TV]: And how do youknow what his real character is? WOMAN [ON TV]: I know. I know. MAN [ON TV]: She knows. This is the way science goes backward. Who told you what he is? Freud? What was the film? I don't know. I switched it on in the middle. It wasn't very interesting. Cheers. What's for supper? I've only had a sandwich all day. What? GEORGE: I'm starving. Well, what have you cooked for supper? Nothing. I didn't think of it. Are you feeling all right, Eleanor? I'm feeling fine, thank you. You said Eleanor. GEORGE: Oh, a slip of the tongue. Yes, but who's Eleanor? GEORGE: You are. It's your name, Eleanor. No wonder I called myself Nelly. GEORGE: Look, you're stillnot quite yourself yet. I think you'd feel better if Imoved back into the spare room. What do you think? If you want to. What do you mean, back into the spare room? Well, the way we were before you went away. We had an understanding. NELLY: I suppose you know what you're doing. Well, yes, I think I do. NARRATOR: On first returning to the house, George had been an entertaining companion, the passionate lover. And he grew cool and distant, frequently saying nothing at all. He was away a lot on business,coming and going at odd hours. She felt lonely and distraught in a way she had never felt at the hotel. NELLY [VOICEOVER]: My life is passing. I cannot get a grasp on it. No meaning in it. Life slipping through myfingers like sand or water. Writing has now become a necessity. I find it difficult to know whatI think until I write it down, then it becomes clear and lucid. But, often, I'm not sure to what extent in writing I'm falsifying. [footsteps] George, I want a job. A job? What on earth for? Because I'm bored. I'm bored with not usingmy mind on anything useful. But you haven't worked since we were married, and then it wasn't anythingyou really wanted to do. Well, I want to now. What do you suggest? Should I see your personnel manager? What? Of our company? Yes. And they might be able to suggest something. I wouldn't want anything grand, but I'm sure I could contribute something. Well, I suppose you couldhave a word with personnel. You don't sound very enthusiastic. No, it's not that. It's that I don't think you'll find it is easy to find a really satisfying job as you may imagine it. Perhaps you're right, but I want to try. Well, we'll see then. WOMAN [VOICEOVER]: Name? NELLY [VOICEOVER]: Nelly Wilkinson. WOMAN [VOICEOVER]: Age? NELLY [VOICEOVER]: Not known. Put around 50. What academicqualifications do you have? A school certificate, university? NELLY: Not known, put none. Shorthand and typing? NELLY: No, none. Any languages? NELLY: I don't think so. A little French, maybe, but nothing fluent. Any previous experience? NELLY: Not known. WOMAN: And what would you sayyour qualities or talents were? I'm perceptive, intelligent,a good listener, very good judge of people, and I learn quickly. Are those qualities you can use? Very important, impressive. But no substitute forqualifications and experience? I'm afraid not. What would you suggest then? Mrs. Wilkinson, as you know, I'm familiar with your circumstances. But I'm afraid, with this curriculum vitae, we have no possible openings for you. I have to be honest. It's funny. You know, I have everything a woman could possibly want, except a job. Yes. NELLY: You know, when youconsider all those people who are out of work, who havenone of the advantages I have to fall back on, makesyou think, doesn't it? It certainly does. I wonder what they'll do about it. Time will tell. [bird cawing] WOMAN [ON RADIO]: While boxing special is-- [music playing on radio] GEORGE: And she said,well, that's no use at all. And he said, why not. And she said, well, in the first place, this is a respectable house. And in the second place, your feet are too big. [laughter] And in any case, it was a Thursday. Morning. Morning. Fresh coffee for you, as well? Tea, please. I saw your suitcase in the hall. Mm. NELLY: Are you going away again? Yes. Business. I don't know how long it'll be fore. As you like. What's that mean? Nothing. I don't think it'll make any difference, will it? GEORGE: Well, you'll remember Ms. Monroe, the personnel officer you met? NELLY: Yes? She had an accident at work. Fell down a lift shaft. Was she badly hurt? Shaken and bruises. She'll need a few days off. George, are you serious? Well, of course. Who'd joke about a thing like that? Not you, George. Oh, the pictures are now OK. Are you all right, Mrs. Wilkinson? Are you OK? I'll be going out. MS. WYCKHAM [VOICEOVER]: Youknow, I haven't seen you for so long, I didn't recognize you. NELLY [VOICEOVER]: Oh, you're mistaken. MS. WYCKHAM [VOICEOVER]: Of course, I realize how it must be, comingback after all these years. NELLY [VOICEOVER]: Oh, no, youmisunderstand me, Inspector. I hardly know her. She seemed to take it into herhead that we were old friends. DAVID [VOICEOVER]: Why on earth should I claim to be your son if I'm not? MAN [VOICEOVER]: I'm very sorryto hear of the old man's death. He often talked about you. FORCETT [VOICEOVER]: Women like it. Well, I suppose you can't blame them. Good for bringing up children. Quiet and peaceful. NELLY [VOICEOVER]: Are you sure? I heard a woman nearly gotmurdered only the other day, just up the road from her. You must put it all behindyou, treat it like a bad dream. The past is best forgotten. MS. WYCKHAM [VOICEOVER]: How dare you patronize me with your evil?Pure evil. MAN [VOICEOVER]: No, I'm a brush salesman. Could you direct with to Maiden Lane? NELLY [VOICEOVER]: I'm sorry. I'm a stranger here myself. MAN [VOICEOVER]: Oh, well, expect I'll get there in the end. [doorbell] Good afternoon, madam. I wonder if you'll be interested in seeing our superior range ofdomestic and personal brushes. I'd be delighted. Please, come in. Thank you, madam. This is Duke of Wellington range, for the gentleman of the house. And for the lady, we havethe latest innovation in brush technology, developedfrom research and development for the American space program. We call it our Mrs. Mop, strong,sturdy, eats up the dirt. You may remember the namefrom the ITMA radio program. Tommy Handley. Can I do you now, sir? That's right. Before my time, of course,but I do remember the records. Here, we have a range of brushesyou may not have seen before. For the dressing table, we'vetried to combine all the best elements of the old traditionalmethods and the new technology. Here, for example, is a brushwith a traditional wooden mahogany handle, with the latest space age technology nylon bristles. It will pass through the hairlike a knife through butter. LEACH [VOICEOVER]: Did you talk to anyone? NELLY [VOICEOVER]: A man. He told me he was a brush salesman. LEACH [VOICEOVER]: Odd. NELLY [VOICEOVER]: What? Being a brush salesman? LEACH [VOICEOVER]: Could be. It's an outdated profession. NELLY: Do you cook? Oh, no, it's one of your poetry books. "At the round earth's imaginedcorners, blow your trumpets, angels, and arise. Arise from death, you numberless infinities." NELLY [VOICEOVER]: Are you the angel of death? Wonderful, isn't it? They don't write like that anymore, do they? No, they don't. Do have a biscuit. Thank you. [glass shattering] [dog barking] [dog whining] You've got a lot of valuables here. Yes. And you heard nothing? Nothing at all. Very curious. Definitely a break in, yet nothing was taken. [knocking] Come in. Another ma'am from the CAE. DETECTIVE: CID. MAID: Same thing. [laughter] Are you or are you not Mrs. George Wilkinson? I believe so. You're not sure? No. Then are you Mrs. Dean? I may be. Or are you both? I couldn't possibly be both, could I? Then who are you? I really don't know. Does it matter? For the purpose of our inquiries, yes. It could be an inside job. But nothing was stolen? Nothing was stolen that you wish to admit to. Such as? Money. Money that people don't wantto declare to the tax man. I can assure you, Inspector,I have absolutely no money that I'm not entitled to. NARRATOR: After the break inand Inspector Leach's visit, she became moody and dispirited. An unhealthy feeling of broodinglassitude came over her. She became convinced that shewas the victim of a conspiracy, and somehow David had succeeded in kidnapping her, or at least trappingher on false pretenses. [vacuuming] She saw that David was not her son at all and had simply chosen a gullible and respectable woman as a cover for some schemecentered around the house. DAVID [VOICEOVER]: An emptyhouse becomes a liability, gets run down and-- as wellas being an open invitation for burglars or squatters. SUSAN [VOICEOVER]: It's your house, Mother, and everybody would be so muchhappier if you stayed there. NELLY [VOICEOVER]: But I find the hotel perfectly acceptable and pleasant. DAVID [VOICEOVER]: Well, the house is waiting, ready for use. SUSAN [VOICEOVER]: Please,Mother, as a favor to us. You'd be your own master there,not responsible to anyone. DAVID [VOICEOVER]: We do haveyour best interests at heart. GEORGE [VOICEOVER]: Well, of course, I understand what's happened toyou, how you are, your memory. I think we ought to try again. NARRATOR: Was George themastermind of this conspiracy? More directly than anyone, he had used and manipulated her, initially friendly, then abruptly withdrawing. Coming and going in secretwith his terrifying noises, so that she felt she was going out of her mind. GEORGE [VOICEOVER]: Look, you'renot quite yourself again yet. I think you'd feel better if Imoved back into the spare room. What do you think? NELLY [VOICEOVER]: Are you going way again? GEORGE [VOICEOVER]: Yes, business. I don't know how long it'll be for. NELLY [VOICEOVER]: As you like. GEORGE [VOICEOVER]: Well, what's that mean? NELLY [VOICEOVER]: Nothing. I don't think it'll make any difference, will it? NARRATOR: But what was this conspiracy? It seemed only to requireher seclusion from the world. Was this their plan, to isolateher, and then, in some way, force her to part with the money she held? It seemed quiteplausible, and she became determined to resist them. [train approaching] [child crying] Oh, why is she crying? Because-- because I-- I don't-- You don't know? Is he your brother? Yes. Well, he's going to sleep now, I think. Yeah. Bye-bye. Bye. Are you all right? Do you need any help? Can you understand me? Do you speak English? Francais? Can you stand up? Come on. GEORGE: Hello? What the hell's going on? Shh, George. You're disturbing. I don't believe it. I just don't believe it. George, please, leave us. I'll come and explain. - Leave you? You'll explain? Explain-- you're crazy. What are you talking about, explain? George-- - How are you going to expect--- Please-- How do you explain this? What is this? God damn it. Explain? Can you explain anything,anything at all, that happens in that God damnedhead of yours, that vacuum that passes for a brain? You want me to leave? All right, I'm leaving. And, this time, it's for good. [door closing] [laughter] NARRATOR: Nelly is now convalescing in a very nice place whichstands in its own grounds. She's quiet, the service is excellent, and she's well looked after. Before completing this account, she reread what she had previously written and was struck by the way shesaw herself, like a character in a novel, the victim of conspiracy. NELLY [VOICEOVER]: I realize now that mine was, in fact, a quite ordinarylife amongst ordinary people. Because of the strain I was under, I quite mistakenly saw myself as a victim. NARRATOR: But perhaps it islike a novel relating everything as it happened, only changing the names to protect the innocent. NELLY [VOICEOVER]: Here, everybody is very kind, and I recognize a few old faces from the past. Mrs. Knatchbull is staying hereand still talks about her son. NARRATOR: She does not read much now and never watches television. Instead, she sits outdoorsa lot, watching nature. People come and chat to her from time to time. NELLY [VOICEOVER]: A bank clerk tells me he was the victim of a plothatched by jealous colleagues and that he was wronglydismissed for taking some cash. A retired police officer is convinced the world is full of murderers. Ms. Wyckham seems depressed,sitting alone for hours, talking to nobody. George Wilkinson has visited me several times and mentioned that his businessis in a temporary, but quite serious, financial crisis. He's asked me to consider lending him the money I have on deposit. The warm and sunny autumn is now over. The days are drawing in and it gets dark early. Winter evening lie aheadon the long, cold nights. I have been contemplating takinga journey where there will be opportunities to visit different places and meet some interesting people. [music playing]
