Wow, she's dead! Gentlemen, please! May I say a few words? All of us regret this murder as much as you do. And we are doing everything in our power to catch the perpetrator of this crime! If you haven't done, but you can't have much power. Very well put. But Scotland Yard has shorter personnel. Where are the police inspectors that arrested the Ringer? - They were put on the mail robbery case. - That's a lifetime job, really. - We've got 3 million already! - Is 3 out of 30 million a good return? - No, but it's still... - Who's responsible for this failure? - Certainly not I. - Who is looking for the strangler? - One of my best men: Inspector Hopkins. - He has discovered nothing so far. Sir John, you're in charge of this department, don't you feel responsible? - At least are you planning to resign? - Gentlemen, I conclude the meeting! You're free to get your information wherever you like. From the garbage pail, or from each other, but not from me. Good morning! - That'll make a first class headline! - With a few grim details. - Strangled again, just like the others. - And she was also wearing gloves. - There is nothing unusual on that. - Even in the middle of summer? - Well, it's a very rainy one. - Doctor, hasn't it occurred to you, how remarkably soft and white the hands of all the murder victims are? Inspector, the poor girl is dead. That makes anyone's hands pale. - Nowadays nearly all women have soft hands. - Yes, nearly all. Good morning, Doctor! Tell me, Hopki... Hopkins, you are kidding! I have to cope with the reporters... and you seem to be holding the wake, here! Do you have the offender! No? Then hurry up! The "Morning Star" is already talking about a new Macky Messer! - You surely mean: Jack the Ripper. - I don't mind, how this guy is called! If you're dissatisfied with me, someone else can take over the case. But Hopkins, don't talk nonsense! Don't be so fussy. - Have you visited the scene of crime? - The place where the body was found, Sir. - That's not necessarily the scene of crime. - Of course not. Just as a lady... - doesn't drive a car in that get-up. - I've got the impression, it's not a lady who is involved here. Just like the other victims of The Strangler. A criminologist is not supposed to have feelings, my dear, but here: brains! His grey matter. Use them and report to me... - when you have got the... the... - Jack, the Ripper. - Thank you. When you have got the Ripper. - Good morning. Oh my god, what a sensitive fellow! Yes. Go on, Emily. Take this down, please. First of all the date. "Made out by the undersigned attorney Harold Stone, address, and so forth. Report regarding Miss Wanda Merville, New York, New York. Particulars regarding her passport, Y45, 4689, issue..." You find all that here! "Miss Merville declares herself ready... to take over her father's, Lord Donald Perkins', estate." Well, that's about all. I'll call for you if I need you. - Your secretary is very pretty. - What? Yes, yes. And extremely conscientious. Well, shall we open the will? "I, Lord Donald Perkins, hereby dedicate my daughter Wanda Merville... as sole heir to my entire fortune of approximately 50'000 pounds." What? 500.000 pounds? How many dollars is that? About one and a half million. Miss Emily, please come in here! Yes, and in all those years you never heard of your father, correct? Yes, I went with my mother to America. She started using her maiden name again. Two years later she was killed in a car accident. - But he thought about you very often. - My father? Oh, no. Yes. He send me on a trip to the United States to find out how you were living, what you did. And furthermore... - To find out if I deserved his inheritance? - Yes. He knew nothing about you. - So, you were in America? - Yes, 2 weeks. - Why didn't you contact me then? - I preferred just to observe you. - Didn't my father have any other relatives - Yes, a brother. General Perkins. Yes. Ah! There you are! Take this down: "The will has been read out to Miss Wanda Merville. She is willing to take over the entire inheritance." - Yes. - That's about all for the time being. Tomorrow we both go to a notary, have your signature registered legally. - I'll pick you up at the hotel. Your hotel! - Thank you, Mr. Stone. - Your passport, Miss Merville. - By the way, you must be exhausted... - I already have, Mr. Stone. - You see? Conscientious! Hey! Where have you taken me, driver? I said to the Hotel Savoy! Hey, you! Driver! Help! Come on, girls! You were singing this lovely music without any expression. A chorale must be joyful. It must have a jubilant tone. I'll show. l'll sing it alone, this time. Try to give it that quality of joyful exaltation. For instance: "Freude schone Gotterfunke!" - Have I made myself quite clear? - No, Jane, be careful! I would like to know why aren't permitted to write letters home? Why all contact... - with the outside world is forbidden? - But I have permission to write home. And I received mail from home as well. - Maybe you do, but we don't! - Is that true, Mrs. Oberin? We're treated here even worse than in a prisoner camp. What have we done? I know you already nearly by heart, Jane. Robbery! Fraud! - Not to mention the other charge. - I thought that my prison time was up! - But I see it isn't! - This home was founded by Lady Perkins. It's to help you to find a way out of prison into a normal life once more. That's a dirty lie. This so called home is more horrible than any jail I've seen! - You be quiet! - Those are extremely serious accusations, you're making! What do think of the child, Mrs. Oberin? That girl is nothing but a pathological liar. There. You heard it yourself. You stand entirely alone with your denunciations. So then, you should reconsider. Apologize for your harsh words. Then you might perceive permission to write to your loved one's at home. Alright. Let's sing it once more! Let me go! - What do you want from me? - You really don't know? - I can imagine. My father's will? - Exactly. - I've only have a few dollars in my pocket. - I can wait. Look here. What do you want? - What are you offering? - If you take me back to my hotel at once, I won't tell anyone. You don't realize your true value, Miss Wanda Merville. Please sit down. No! What are you doing to me? No! Please! No! No! No, let me go! Listen to me! No! Please, don't! No! I do whatever you want! No! I'll do... whatever you want. - Our new student has passed out. - Hurry up! Get on with your work! You heard what I said. Then take it on with your work! If it gives you satisfaction to beat up, I'll make it easy for you. Go on! Get on with your work. At that moment it was exactly 8:32. The tank brigade was assembled under the orders of General Perkins... on the field of battle. The situation was unusually confused. - Confused! Why was it confused? - It says so here, Sir. When I stepped on the battle field, the situation was crystal-clear. We were all retreating. The battle was lost. Or so it looked! But then I came! I sent all our heavy tanks to the front! Tanks hold! Fire at will! Bang, bang! Right, Marjorie. Don't move! The enemy is ahead of you. Right behind you is Tobruk, and I'm coming from here. - Sand clouds. Wind from the west. - From the east, Edward. - Why do you say "the east"? - Because it always came from the east, - when you were telling the story before. - From the east? Yes! And furthermore behind me isn't Tobruk, it's Emily with the tea. - The battle is over now, Anthony. - Very well, My Lady. - I always said the wind came from the east? - What's important is that we won the war. Be satisfied with that. - Who's coming now? - We're expecting Archie for tea. Naturally, the inevitable Sir John. That playboy of antiquity. I'll be very angry in a minute! After all you're not exactly this pretty chicken. Thank you. You're looking well, Marjorie! How are you, General? Oh, she's very attractive, and I mean very attractive. Is she new? - Yes. - I only have her half-days. - She has a sick father to look after. - Oh, was that her? Yes. Please don't play with the flowers. They're supposed to be for me! - Naturally. Please forgive me. - Now, sit down. - Thank you. Isn't any body else here? - You are wondering where Wanda is. - She hadn't gotten in touch with me yet. - Really? She must have arrived in London. She must not report. She is the one who is getting my brothers money. - When I hear you talk, you'll forgive me... - Thank you. - ...but I think you begrudge her the money. - What do you want? It's the truth. - A half million pounds is a lot of money! - Oh, Edward. You are insufferable, today! - Well, I'm right or not, Archie? - You know, a young and pretty girl... - whom luck falls into her lap... - Who tells you she is pretty? My instinct... In every case, I will look after her. After all, she is your niece. Oh, David. How nice you were able to come today. - You do know Sir John. - Of course. Sir John. Uncle Edward! - At ease! - You have been in the forces, as well? - I was also in Tobruk, Sir John. - As chaplain. On the battlefield of God one can win victories too, uncle. Apropos: How are your parishioners? His little flock gives him such a pleasure. Even if a few of them... are black sheep, and who's thoughts are of too worldly and unholy nature! Gossip, that's all! - I think it's very interesting. - And odd at the same time. I'm pleased the black sheep in this case are so attractive and full of sex appeal. Oh, bless for me, Sir. If I can be of any help to you, - I have a great deal of worldly experience! - Can you imagine David, Wanda still hasn't put in an appearance. - I'd like to see Miss Wanda Merville. - You're Mr. Stone? - Yes. - She is in room 312. She waits for you. Thank you. - Come in! - Good morning, Miss Merville. - Good morning. - Did you have a good night sleep? - Very good, thank you. - Wonderful. Oh, I'm very sorry. I must have knocked at the wrong door. - Why, Mr. Stone? What's the matter? - I wanted Miss Merville. - You're looking at her. - That's a good joke. I'm afraid not. You wanna see my passport? Here. Well? This is Miss Merville's passport, however you're not Wanda Merville. How do you know that the girl you met yesterday was really Miss Merville, - and not someone who was impersonating her? - I know Miss Merville personally. Mr. Stone, from today, I'm Miss Wanda Merville. Is that perfectly clear? No! But what I can do is inform the police of this situation, and I do it from here. While you're at it, don't forget to tell the police about the little embezzlement you were doing when you were administrating Lord Perkins' estate. - What did you say? I? - Yes. You! Here are the records. - And just who are you? - I will introduce myself later. It may displease certain customers. I did only ease their tax to the police. But I didn't skirt the law on occasion... I will kill you if you don't do what I tell you. - Do you understand? - Yes, I do, but... - You refuse them? - Yes, Sir. I mean no, Sir. You'll go with this lady to the notary's office to let her signature be registered. I wouldn't think of it! Do you understand me now? Yes, Sir. - You're talking too loud. - Nora, do you know who she is? - I don't wanna know. - What was the name of that lawyer? - Stone. - His telephone number? Jane, don't get involved of this! - I got it, Mayfair 6725 - Think of Cynthia and Alice. They tried - to do something and never came back! - I think we have to be more careful, too. Then we'll never escape. I can't go on and live like this anymore. - I got to take the chance. - Jane! - Stone is speaking. Who's calling, please? - Listen, Mr. Stone. I'm calling on behalf of Wanda Merville. She is... Hello! Hello! Stone, I'm warning you. You haven't heard anything and no one called. And don't forget we're waiting for those papers to come. You have only 24 hours. Not a minute longer. It's open! - Who is it? Oh, excuse me, Sir John! - Hopkins, why don't you report to me? We've been trying to telephone you since yesterday! - Just a minute. - What's wrong? It's time to grow up, Hopkins! One doesn't do that. Today is my washday. And besides that my cleaning woman is in vacation. In Capri. - Hopkins, have I your undivided attention? - Yes. - Aren't you wondering why I am here? - I can almost imagine. - Could you hold this please. - This can't go on any longer, Hopkins. - The Strangler has... - Anything wrong? - No, no. - I am bachelor, Sir John. Come off from behind your silly washing. It'll dry without your help. I have something to tell you. Listen, the Strangler has struck again. - Another girl. And strangled again. - And once again without the slightest... - bit of a clue. - Yes. Just like all the others. - That's what so incredible. - Are you coming to the morgue with me? No, no Hopkins. I... I don't enjoy looking at girls when they're dead. Pathological report May 18th, 1966. File number 84709. Microscopic examinations reveals... that the victims hands have been in contact for about a year... with powerful and corrosive washing products. Cleaning agent of this kind... are usually sold commercially. The medical report is followed by a chemical analysis - of these particular products. - Doctor, tell me, - what would you assume from that? - All the victims must have worked... in a laundry, that uses very cheap washing powders that both irritates... and soften the skin. The enemy, where is he? He's standing ready to engage in the defense. You're disobeying my orders, Anthony. I going to have you court-martialed! - But that's how we always did. - Yes, with these imbecile diagrams here! That's the point. I'll write Montgomery that the diagrams are completely wrong! - All tanks in retreat formation! - All tanks in retreat formation, Sir! - Where is the wind? - Yes, Sir. - An the fog! Anthony, where is the fog? - I'm sorry Sir. I forgot it. I'm going to have you shot at sunrise! You're totally absent minded. - I'm afraid, I didn't sleep well, Sir. - You're lying, Anthony. - Last night your bedroom was unoccupied. - I had a terrible headache, Sir. - I went for a walk in the park. - Recently, you have a lot of headaches. If the battle of Tobruk could be interrupted for a couple of minutes, I have wonderful news for you: Archie has brought Wanda back! Wanda? Wanda Merville? Did the old fox manage it after all. Let's go. The manoeuvre is over! I must tell you how wonderful you look. You look positively beautiful. - Thank you, Sir John. - Oh no. Please not "Sir John". All my friends call me Archie. Even your father. We were good friends. - We played poker in the same club... - Good afternoon, everyone! Good afternoon. Oh, I'm confused. Where was I just now? - Playing poker. - Yes, that's right. - That isn't Donald's daughter. - Why? How can you say such awful things? - She doesn't have any resemblance. - I resemble mother a lot. She always said: "Thank God, that you don't take out to your father." - Hope I didn't offend you. - That's quite alright. And I say "thank God" for that, too. I'm not disclosing any secret. I didn't like my brother. A salesman with an adding machine in his brain. That's what enabled him to leave over 500.000 pounds. - What are you going to leave? - Nothing. Exactly. Well, shall we sit down. - And who are you Sir? - Inspector Hopkins. He brought me, here. Not a nice profession you picked out for yourself. Why are you behaving like an ill man? You must not take him too seriously. - Won't you take your coat off? - Oh, yes. - A little port, Sir John. - Thank you. - Anything else? - The gloves. Thank you, it's all right. Wanda, sit over here next to my husband. I have the impression... - that he has fallen in love with you. - Let's say the first contact was... - executed successfully. How is the will? - Inspector! Would you come sit here? - I love having young men close to me. - The closer the better, huh? Sorry! Where is our exciting little Emily today? Doing a few errands for me in town. Royal proclamation, year 1712. I've found it! And so forth and so forth. Should however prove the same as in paragraph 7/13, article 2/19/7, in other words a registration can be dispensed with! I found it! Harold Stone called embezzling. That is almost the same... as if the Queen has been accused of strip teasing! - Please put me through to Scotland Yard! - The telegram is just coming for you. - Read it to me. - "Awaiting documents for will of... Mr. Perkins. Otherwise funeral Mr. Stone tomorrow one o'clock Central Cemetery." It's signed, "a friend". Should I put you through Scotland Yard? No! That's enough for the day! - What is it? - Lady Perkins has just telephoned. - The inspection already takes place today. - When? In one hour. Turn off the showers! Come out! - What this all about? - Nothing special. - They have an inspection every other month. - When I get close to Lady Perkins, - I'll ask her if she knows about Jane. - Watch out! Sandra! Stop your gossiping! Be off with you! Not you. Marjorie is one of the greatest benefactors of mankind. No, we are merely attempting to help out young girls... - who had gotten into trouble. - Sir John told me about your work. And my husband, the dear angel, allowed me to convert Castlewood to the school. The old barrack isn't good for anything else, to be honest. Won't you come on the inspection tour? We have more than 20 girls in my home. No, that sort of things depresses me. Besides I must go back to the hotel. - And you, Inspector? - Another time, I have something to do. - They are all previously convicted. - Fallen angels. - Wanda is in the cellar. - Dead? - No. - What if they discover? It's a risk we must take once in a while, if we want to remain in business. And then the real Wanda Merville can be our trump card. How do you do, Lady Perkins? - Well, Archie, what do you say? - Extraordinary, really extraordinary! They deserve a new start in life. And it is up to us to show them the way. Yes. We must. It's our duty as human beings. Are the shower facilities used every day? Of course, My Lady. The girls just left the shower 20 minutes ago. - What a pity. - Do all of you have anything you need? - Yes, everything, Lady Perkins. - I'm glad to hear it! - I suppose that's all for today. - What a pity. Lady Perkins, may I ask you something? Yes. Naturally. What is it, my child? One of the girls, Jane Cowler, suddenly disappeared yesterday. Yes. We dismissed Jane before the term is over because of her good behaviour. - But the... - Well, now my dear children, before we leave, Lady Perkins would love to hear one of the chorals we rehearsed. On whom God disperses favours. One, two and three! What on earth was that? I heard somebody screamed just now! - A new arrivals, My Lady. A tragic case. - What's the name of the girl? Vanderbilt. - Yes. Patsy Vanderbilt, My Lady. - I'd like to have a word with her. - Yes, I would like to, too. - I'm going to get her. - What about discipline, David? Are there any complaints? No, Aunt Marjorie. - The girls are good and obedient, but... - What "but", David... Sometimes I wish they were more open-minded and less inhibited towards me. - But probably, you can't expect that. - Oh, yes you can! - Here she is, My Lady. - Why did you scream like that, my child? I'm afraid, under these circumstances the girl refuses to communicate. A typical symptom of an addict. It's not true, they're lying! Why were you send to prison? - Go on tel! Lady Perkins. - For perjury. Then, I'd be more careful with my accusation if I were you. - Why this poor girl was send to us here? - She belonged to a drugs ring, - and then she became addicted herself. - Am I to understand that... - drug addiction in England is tolerated? - Of course not! As a matter of fact, it's severely punished. But when you stop one leak you get two others. What is becoming of this world. Come on, David. - Archie, let's go home. - Yes, yes, I'm coming. - Laura! - Alright, everyone change now! It's time to get back to your work! - What did you do to the girl? - Injection. - You're seem to me like a monster, Allan. - All the better. - What? What do you want from me? - You know very well. I'm sure you know what happened to Jane! - And what happened to the others. - I swear, I don't know. I tell the truth! You're lying! - Here! Here's how you kept them informed. - No, it isn't true! No. Don't do it! Get away from her! Leave her alone! You'll be sorry you did this. Come, Viola, don't be afraid. Murderer! I want all of you downstairs in 5 minutes! Hurry! Get out! Hurry! Come on, hurry. I think you should have taken a taxi. Somebody has something against me. - Or against you. - Who has anything against me? You put your life in the hands of the police and look where it gets to! Here. The only thing that is intact. Your gloves are all dirty. Take them off. - I hold the purse for you. - Do you want me... - to get my hands dirty as well? - I wouldn't think of it! Mrs. Tyndal? Viola is on the way over. I was forced to let her go. - I hope you have work for her. - Certainly. Send over the pretty girls. - Business is wonderful these days! - I'm always glad to be of help. - Where did this Hopkins vanish? - I don't know. He phoned to say that... - he was taking Miss Merville to her hotel. - When it comes to rescue pretty maiden, suddenly my loyal inspectors finely have time to kill! - He won't get away with it! - Your tea, Sir John. Thank you, my dear. Hello? CH 97538... CH 97538... - Sir John... - Stop interrupting me! - CH 97538, report immediately! - This is CH 975. It's about time! Splendid! A good thing you are here. But I must say you have me quite scared for a while. Have you any consideration for my health? Tell me, what's new? - I'm wondering myself, Sir. - You're wondering. Thank you my child. - And I may ask what you are wondering? - I'm wondering just why Miss Merville... is so reluctant to take her gloves off. And how she could have been... at the opera the 12th, when she arrived from New York on the 16th. Ah, very curious. What have you been doing? I believe it's time for another washday, don't you think so, Sir? - There is a possibility of getting out. - Do you really think so? - I'm sure. One girl has already done it. - They might be here, watch out! Maybe I'll be lucky. If not, think of me in case you're out first. Laura! - Laura just passed out. - Get up! Water! You can count on me completely, Lady Perkins. I'm sure she'll do it. - Leave us alone. - Very well. Come here. - What's the matter? - I don't know, Sir. - I feel better. I apologize for fainting. - How long have you been with us? - Nearly 2 years. - I've studied your record. Your comments are excellent. The matron describes you as particularly reliable. I always tried to be cooperative, Sir. - You want to get out of here? - Yes, Sir. There is a possibility. Only for a few, though. Only for girls who are as pretty as you. Who have learned... to obey... - the rules. - Yes, Sir. The photographs from New York just came in. - Does it mean anything. - Yes, it means that someone in London... right now, the real Wanda Merville, is in the greatest danger. That is, if she is still alive. Hello, Parker, listen. On the 16th at the Savoy a Miss Wanda Merville... from New York registered there. Send 2 men over and question every one. I want to know what she was doing every second of the day. What? Yes, nights too. This is the new girl, her name is Laura. Help her she hasn't had any experience. - Hello. - Hello. I tell you once more: Any contact to the outside is forbidden and will be punished! - That's for all of you. You understand? - Yes, Mrs. Tyndal. Alright, go on up. In half an hour, you can begin work. Come on! Here she is. We know each other. - What's wrong? Lost you power of speech? - No, Reverend. - You're surprised to see me here? - Yes, Reverend. In my work, we must know the heights and depths of life, in order to understand... - everything and to be able to forgive. - I've made her familiar with your views. Good, then get to work. Think of the rewards you will receive, when it's your turn to go to heaven. Now, get going! - Hello, Inspector. - Hello, Sergeant. - She just went inside the house, alone. - Thank you, Sergeant. I have something over here. I'm sure you like. Come and see. Hey, wait a minute. What shall we have to drink? Since when do you disobey my orders. In case you have forgotten, Gladys, - I forbade you to come to this house. - You should be grateful I did come here. - What does that mean? Out for it! - Your Emily, whom you regard so highly, just made me a very tempting proposal. Shall I continue? - Stop playing games, go on! - She discovered a certain secret. She wouldn't give me the details but she is willing to spend half and half with me. - Why with you? - Use your brain. It's because she needs the fake Wanda Merville. What shall I do? Shall I accept her offer? If you no longer value your life, go right ahead. - What's Laura doing here? - It doesn't concern you! - Are you crazy? She isn't trustworthy! - Shut your mouth! - No one asks you for your opinion. - But I tell you, she is a... That's enough! That was a mistake. Why was she brought here? How could I know? I thought she... You are paid to act not to think! Pity Allan. I'm very sorry. You shouldn't have done that. Now get out. The two of you. - What's the matter? - Hopkins! Go, quickly! Stop behaving so inept. You can see that we have guests. And they only come here to do one of two things. Drink or gamble... in pleasant company. Get to work! - Hello, Mrs. Tyndal. How are you? - Judge Howard, I'm pleased to see you. - Is there something I can do for you? - No, thank you. - A drink then? - Oh yes. I could use it. - May I invite you to join me? - Of course, you can. Thank you. - Shall we sit down? - Of course. - What does one drink here? - One drinks champagne, usually. How special, is that it? Excuse me. - Do you know who Laura is sitting with? - Am I supposed to? With Inspector Hopkins of Scotland Yard! Oh, I'm sorry. - You haven't been at this very long? - Yes, I have. But... You're also not good at lying. You are far to unsure of yourself. You're a beginner. - You're looking for someone? - Yes. A young woman about your build. Dark blond, long hair and pretty. In fact beautiful. - She came in here alone. Cheers. - Cheers. - Are you from the police? - Yes. They are holding me in this house as a prisoner. - I have something important to tell you. - Pst! Tell me later. Now, I'm sorry, Sweetheart. We'll make it another time. Here. Have a nice evening on me. - You have a complaint, Sir? - No, not at all! Just the opposite fact. Glad are you. The guests are usually very satisfied. May I have your name? - Inspector Hopkins of Scotland Yard. - I believe our license is in order. Don't let my profession frighten you. Even an Inspector needs a night off. Good evening. Come on. - What were you saying to him? - Nothing. I swear it. What were you talking about? - The usual things. - Oh, leave her alone. - Don't tell me it was just a coincidence. - How did he introduce himself? - As Inspector Hopkins of Scotland Yard. You know he didn't walk in here just for pleasure. He's out for something! So, close up the place! Excuse me, Ladies and Gentlemen. We have just received the information... there will be a police raid. this evening. We must ask you to leave the club... immediately. It's in your own interest. The emergency exits are in the back. Sir John, there is a connection between the murders and the disappearance... of Wanda Merville. And once more the club, the Mekka, is mixed up in it. I can prove it. If you will only issue me a warrant to search the place. You ask me for something very delicate. But I'm not afraid of a bit of trouble. I'll risk it. Open up. Police! Open up! So your Laura didn't say anything? And that Inspector wasn't suspicious? Well done! So, you didn't say a word? Do you hear what's going on outside? Yes, I hear and I'm glad the police are here! Scotland Yard! Now it's your turn! Now you get what you deserve! They'll make you pay for everything. Murderers! Keep her here with you! - Upstairs, hurry! - Empty, not a soul in the place. I knew it. I always said you were a fool! - Where are you going, Sir John? - Submit my resignation, naturally! Open up! Police! - She is the one you spoke to? - Yes. You better look on the other side. Yes, Sir! What are you looking for? Hopkins, what are you looking for? Will you answer me? For God's sake! Oh, what it stinks down here! It's worth than the zoo! - You stay here, Sir John. That is safer. - No! And now come on! After me! - Hopkins! Speak up! Are you there? - Sir John! Hopkins! Sir John! Sir John! What happened? You know, Hopkins, - I believe I just looked death in the eye. - You mean the Strangler? - Where am I? - Brandon Street, Eastend London, England. - I need a taxi. - Why? You better go back downstairs... - and go by underground. That'll be faster. - I don't want to be spoken to like that! - Don't you know who I am? - No. Then, I won't tell you. Emily! Put me through to Scotland Yard. I wouldn't advise you to call them, Mr. Stone. - And why not? - You're in a very precarious situation. Or is your life really worth so little? - How do you know that? - From that telegram you got. - The telegram. - Yes, I have a suggestion to make. You give me 10% of the inheritance and I take care of the man who threatens you! And just how would you do that? What do you want? Interesting Emily. I never knew you were so versatile. The police must have seen it. There is nothing we can do about it. I'm afraid it has become to risky to keep him around. You know what to do, Allan. - You heard I! Is he downstairs? - Yes. - And the girls? - They are all asleep. - I shall... - Yes, you. Harry! Harry! I'm sorry. I see no one is indispensable around here. True words were never spoken. - What's wrong? - A small mishap. The matron has left us. Harry was faster. Strangled! Now, there is a different situation. For you, too. If you want to stay with us, you can take over the matrons job. - What is it worth? - A half a thousand pounds. - For that money, I resell my soul. - You can begin now. In the dormitory... is a girl named Wanda Merville. Bring her down her without being seen. - You think she'd come? - Say the matron is sick... - and you're replacing her for tonight. - Right. All settled. - Have you had a talk with Allan? - Yes. - Is everything alright? - I hope so. - What is it, Anthony? You can go now. - Very well, My Lady. Give me some whisky. Straight. Just think if Sir John would have a sudden brainstorm... - and take the case over himself! - That would do harm to our reputation. - But I have taken care of that. - I were sure I could rely on you. Miss Merville, you're alive, - and it's thank to me. - To us. Do you really expect me to thank you? I'll tell you one thing: If I stay here any longer, I probably go crazy or kill myself. Neither of us want that. Therefore, we have a little proposal to make. You are a clever girl, listen carefully. Mrs. Tyndal will take you to a safe place where nobody can find you. When your money is in our hands, you'll go free. But Allan, the club has been blown. Good, that will not harm us. But how did the inspector find that out? Has he seen me? - You don't need to be afraid, Gladys. - Really not, Allan? Are you honest? Of course, darling. I won't to you. Believe me, until the police finds it out, we will be miles away. You stay here and see no one gets out. - Are you expecting someone? - No. - Ask who it is. - Who is it? Please, open up! This is no time to loose your nerve. Get going! Just a second! I'll be right there. Oh, it's you, Inspector, hello. This is certainly a surprise. I'm sure. There is no use to deny, Miss Gardner. That is your name. We received the telephoto of the real Wanda Merville. Won't you sit down? There are a few questions that I'd like to ask you. First of all: Who are you working for? - And who is the man on this picture? - Just a friend. - I haven't seen him for month. - Listen, Miss Gardner. If you're smart and tell us everything you know, you can be considered... a witness for the prosecution, and the judge would be very easy on you. - Is that a promise? - Hm. His name is Allan Davis and... See what you can do for her! I'll get him even if it's the last thing I do. This is Sergeant Morgan, connect me with homicide, please. Yes, I'll wait. Sergeant Morgan reporting. I have another juicy little murder for you. What is this, Davis? Are you on the verge of running away from us? Yes. And you should do the same. Hopkins could be here any second. And not alone. - Had something gone wrong? - Gladys is dead. She was about to talk, - so I shot. - How convenient. - I planned on something like this. - You planned on it? What's this? - Have you gone crazy? - I suggest you sit down, Allan. I want to give you a lesson in deduction. Who arranged the deal with Gladys? You! Who got the false papers for her? You! Who'll be accused by the girls here? You! And what's for me, Allan? What have I done? Simply conducted choral music. I have no idea what went on! - And Lady Perkins? - I have nothing to fear from her. Very neatly thought out But there is one person who will incriminate you. Miss Wanda Merville. The real one. You told me she was dead. Where is she? Put that thing away, you might hurt someone with it. - Alright. Where is she? - In the boathouse. Tyndal watches her. It's a shame. You commit suicide when you have so much of your life before you. - That will be the day. - They'll discover you behind that desk. You'll have shot yourself because you couldn't see no other way out. Amen. Will you please sit down? You're driving me crazy with all that pitting around. Now, I know what you are up to. First, you'll take the money and after that, you'll kill me. You are not only blackmailers, you're also murderers. Cold blooded murderers! You stay right here. No! No! Stop! - Reverend! - Yes, my child. But how did you get here? - The hunchback. He's following me! - I'm glad that I came along. Don't be afraid, child. I'll protect you. Quiet! Please, Ladies, be quiet. For the time being, we must keep you here. - We haven't eaten since last night! - We're locked up here since this morning! I will do all I can to see that you are taken care of! And furthermore, I personally will study the records and handle every case individually. You're marvellous! Thank you! Thank you! That's a pleasure! Wait a minute! Ladies, wait your turn! One at a time! Girls, girls! Please! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! - Allan Davis is dead? - Yes, and the matron is dead. Yes? - The police are here, My Lady. - Really, the police? Tell me Marjorie, what was it that Montgomery said to me in Tobruk... - Can't you leave me in peace with Tobruk? - You needn't shout! I was only wondering! Please. Archie, I've got some absolutely horrible news! But don't get excited. - What's happened, Lady Marjorie? - Come on Marjorie, tell us what happened. David has just reported to me that Mr. Allan Davis killed himself. And what's even worse, that is the reason, why! It's a frightful scandal. - I pray to God that it is not true. - Reverend, I believe it will be better... - if you tell us the story yourself. - Yes, Sir. About half an hour ago, Mr. Davis called me and told me he was... I guess first you should know... that his way of operating the girls home didn't entirely meet with my satisfaction. - What was wrong? - Mr. Davies was a strict disciplinarian. But in ways that I couldn't approve as a man of God. - You said he called about a half hour ago! - Yes, he was desperate and hysterical. He said he was near the end of the road. I was to help arrange his getaway. - But where was he getting away? - Out of the country. - We must see if the airports have locked. - But, Sir John... Oh yes, of course! That's no longer necessary. Go on. Naturally, I wouldn't comply with this. So then he proceeded to tell me... - an utterly incredible story. - I tell you it's hair raising, Archie! - Go on, David. - He had hidden Wanda Merville. - The real Wanda Merville! - Go on Reverend. - We left Mr. Davis on the telephone. - Yes. And now comes the worst part. I told him I would inform the police of all this right away! And believe me, I'll always reproach myself for telling it. He heard that, and he committed suicide. - No! - Yes. I heard the shot over the telephone. It was dreadful! Lady Marjorie. We've just been at the home in Castlewood. - We saw everything the Reverend described. - You saw for yourselves? Edward! - I heard it Marjorie, I am not yet deaf. - Your story is very touching, - only it has one slight flaw, Reverend. - And how come I didn't see it? Mr. Davis shot himself through the heart while sitting at the desk. The Reverend... - heard the shot on the telephone. Correct? - Yes, so I did. How could a man that shot himself through the heart hang up the receiver? - But it wasn't hang up! - How do you know that? Get your hands up! Stay where you are, Hopkins! Hands in the air. - Will you put that away. - Stand behind me, Marjorie. No noise, Marjorie! Did you call me, Sir? - A girl screamed just now! - You don't say! Hurry, come on with me! Get going! Don't move! No! Come on! - It doesn't look so good. - A maniac! He is trying to use that girl as a shield. Let's go! Are you tired of living? Get the girl out of here! The game is all over, Reverend! And you lose. - Inspector! What's going on? - Why don't you ask the Reverend? - Shut the hole! Shut that hole! - Where do I turn it off? In the other room is a switchboard! - Go on. Get away from there! Turn it off, turn it off! Turn it off! Come on down! Your name is Harry Winters. Rip his shirt off! If you promise not to take offence, I have something to confess to you. - Come on Archie, this isn't the time to... - For a second, I really suspected... you were involved in these goings-on. In here, Sir. Hopkins, there you are! What happened? Shall we sound the victory call? - I must speak to you, Sir John. - Go on, shot! Alone, Sir John. Yes. Do your duty. Lady Perkins? Where is he? In the cellar. Tanks hold! Fire at will! Not at me, you imbecile! What is going on? - You can go, Anthony. - Yes, Sir. - Would you tell me the meaning of this? - Inspector Hopkins. I've done a little checking up your past, General. And now, I know the whole story. It seems that during the battle of Tobruk, you made some errors in strategy. And you were suspended from your post as field commander... and put in charge in a camp for prisoners of war. The humiliation was to much for you. The public soon forgot you. But one person never let you forget your shame and disgrace and reminded you... what a failure you were. Your brother Donald Perkins, the successful banker, who never bothered to hide his contempt for the army. You wanted to compete with him, be equally successful, but you only knew the methods - you would use with the prisoners of war. - You're imagining things. When your brother died, you wanted to gain control of his fortune... Then turn around, General! - That is Wanda Merville. - I don't know this girl. - I don't know what you're giving at. - I believe you do, General. You tried to get rid of the heiress. But your accomplices double crossed you. They kept Wanda Merville alive to serve their own ambitions. - That is a lie. - But that isn't all. When a particularly pretty girl came to the home, she had to work as your hostess! - You're completely insane! - As you please. Now we come to another mysterious figure. That man who is slavishly devoted to you. In Cairo he was charged of murdering a girl. He had strangled her. You are the one who saved him. The name of the man is Harry Winters! Sergeant! Alright. You know what this is? He thought the Reverend was trying to murder him. He didn't know... you wanted him out of the way because he had become troublesome to you. Don't do it, General! It's foolish. There has been enough blood shed. Face it like a man and go on to gallows like a soldier. Yes, I realize it's badly expressed. But you know what I mean. Will you stay in England, Miss Merville, or are you going back to the States? I don't know yet. First, I'll get out of here! And I have to see Mr. Stone... about some formalities. He must have wondered where I have been all the time. Come in! Good morning, Miss, or whatever you call yourself. I wanna tell you that the game is over. The police should be here every second. Furthermore, regarding that you accused me, I can assure you... that after paragraph 7 article 2/19, it's clear that I am entirely innocent! Moreover, I'd like to find out that I intend to destroy... your false certification. Herewith. You didn't thought so! Confetti! Furthermore, I would now try myself.. to find the authentic Wanda Merville. It's my duty to see that she enjoys... - her late uncle's money. But... - Please go on, Mr. Stone. - I'm the authentic Wanda Merville. - Yes, so you are. - And who are you? - Inspector Hopkins of Scotland Yard. You're here already? That's what I call speed! Now, there are no more obstacles... - to sign over the estate. - In that case, right away, Mr. Stone. I shall! It's fantastic! I've seen such strange things here in this room and met... such strange characters. Mystifying, utterly mystifying! - Better put your glasses back on. - Yes, you're right. Maybe that was the reason. Now...
