We in trouble. (easygoing guitar music) - Your shot. (soft chiming music) (horn beeping) - Hi. So I'm sorry to bother you, but um, could you just tell us where we are? Thank you. (engine humming) This place is weird, man. - Spooky. - Well, it ain't Hoboken. - You know that dude with the crooked eyes? - Yeah. - Probably out there right now under some tree sharpening up his ax. - Yeah or uh... Gasin' up his chainsaw. (roaring) - Shit, Bobby! (laughing) Man, why are we talkin' about this kinda stuff? (maniacal laughing) But you know there's nobody out there. Look, let's just get some sleep. Find our way outta here in the morning. - Ryan, if Captain Chainsaw does come at us tonight, just give 'em some of your moves, ya know? Woo ya! Haaa! - Goodnight. (eerie music) (birds chirping) (watch beeping) - Ryan. Hey. Ryan? Ryan! - Yo! - Geez! - Hey, sleep all right? - Oh, like a baby. I uh, I dreamt I was freezin' to death, and I woke up, and I was. - Yeah, well it was your idea, be your idea. - Well, we need to find a place for food, man. We need to find a place now. - Yeah, no doubt. - And people that don't chew tobacco. (laughing) - Big long spit droolin' down your chin. - [Bobby] Oh, Christ, man, nasty. - Now wait a minute. Way to California? - That way. (suspenseful music) Luddigger's Hardware, Luddigger's Gun Shop. - Yeah, this guy Luddigger's doin' all right for himself. - Let's try his diner. - Yeah, good idea. ♪ At the end of the day, when I'm driving home ♪ Them little boys can really sing a tune ♪ They help me find the laughter in the late afternoon ♪ But just when I'm winding down ♪ And too tired to pretend ♪ Here comes the sad songs ♪ The radio's got me cryin' again ♪ The radio's got me cryin' - Whaddya wanna go sneakin' up on people like that for?

Any of the above served with bacon, ham, sausage, home fries, or grits. We got a special that's a stack of wheats, two eggs, two sausages, or two strips of bacon, and for toast you got your choice of white, rye, or whole wheat. - Hey. - Beverages include coffee, tea, milk, Pepsi, and three kinds of beer, if you're old enough, which I doubt. Four desserts... - Excuse me. - Hear somethin' you like? - I was serious when I said I thought you had a good voice. - And how do you know? - Are you kiddin' me? We're musicians. - Really? You are not. You just got that earring and those hairdo's for effect. - You don't recognize us? Ryan Cassidy and the Bobby Kael? She doesn't recognize us. - It's a small town. - [Ryan] We had the hottest band in Hoboken. - Ho whatten? - Hoboken. - Hoboken. (laughs) What's your name? - Lacey. - Lacey. That's a beautiful name. Anyway, we're on our way to California and we will be famous. - You're not famous? - Uh, not yet. - Soon. - What's your order? You really goin' to California? - [Bobby] Yep. - I bet it's nice there. - Well here, have a seat. I'll tell ya all about it. Come on. (tapping) California is nothing but palm trees and beaches. Beaches are all white sand and the water's so blue, it hurts your eyes just to look at it. - Uh, they also have record companies there, remember? Record companies? - Ah yeah, record companies. - Lord, I wish I was goin'. - Oh, come on, I bet there's a million things to do in Luddigger on a Friday night, huh? - Yeah, there's a dance tonight over at the community center. It's the big event of winter. - Wow. I guess it's time to hit the road. - [Ryan] Wait a minute. - What? - Where did ya say this dance was? - Uh, Ryan, she's probably already got a date. - No I haven't. - Oh man. - Bobby, it'll be fun. - Ryan, this girl does not sound like fun. Probably this girl doesn't even date. - Look, we'll leave right after the dance, scout's honor. - Ahh. - Pssh. (laughing) - I'll take you out, man. - Doubtful. - Look, is this like one of these love at first sight kinda deals? - Well, I don't know. I think she's, she's... - What? - What? - No, I knew it, I knew it. Oh man. What's the deal? Hey! Hey man. Whaddya doin'? You lose somethin' in there? - Is this your truck? - No, this is my truck, what's wrong? - What's your business here in Luddigger? - We's just havin' breakfast, officer. You um, you got some special reason to be messin' around with our stuff? - Yeah, out of state tags. Car could be stolen for all I know. Let me see some ID. - Sure. - Boys enjoy your breakfast? - I've had better. - Tell you what. Why don't you and your earring and your little buddy here, hop in this truck and just take yourselves on back to New Jersey. (train bell dinging) - I'll tell you what. I don't think we're breakin' any laws or nothin' here, so uh, why don't ya just go hide behind a billboard or somethin', huh? (laughing) - What's the problem, Walt? - Mornin' Alger, none of your business. Two punks were just leavin' town. Or they'd better be. (door slamming) (ominous music) - Shouldn't a riled that feller. That's Walt Luddigger. - Yeah, well what's the story with these Luddiggers, anyway? - Mom and Pop Luddigger own everything in this town that's worth on it. In other words, they run the whole place. If I was you boys, I'd make tracks. I'd put as much distance between me and Trapper County as I could, fast as I could. In fact, I wouldn't let any grass grow under me. - Thanks a lot, big fella. - So old Norville busted right into Tom's house with that double barrel shotgun lookin' for his missin' chickens. Tom was standin' on the sofa in the middle of the room, feathers all over tryin' to get them chickens down off the curtain rods. (laughing) I'm tellin' ya, I was laughin' so hard I lost my breath. (bell dinging) Come on in, Alger. - Mornin' George. Sheriff you'll be glad to know that the old deputy walks on the job. Wrestled him a couple of kids from outta state this morning, and sent 'em back. - Mighty fine, Alger. That means we can all sleep a little easier tonight. - You got that right. Now let's see, where was I? So as I was sayin', that old Tom caught red-handed with them chickens, and what do you think he said? - [Sam] I don't know George, what did he say? - Well, he looked at old Norville and said, "Damn you Norville, if you can't keep these chickens "in your own yard, you're gonna be facin' a lawsuit." (laughing) I'm tellin' you, I never saw anything like it. (snorting) - That's a stitch all right, George. Truly a stitch. You know, it'd a been a whole lot funnier though if Norville hadn't a blown Tom in half with that 12 gage. - Lord, you got that right. I was standin' right next to old Tom when he cut loose with that shotgun. (whistling) You talk about a mess. There was pieces of Tom all over the place, I mean all over the curtains, on the furniture, everywhere. Why, there was even a chunk of somethin' floatin' in the fishtank. (bell dinging) You know, that Sheriff's a strange dude. Nice feller and all but uh, he ain't got no sense of humor at all. - Been livin' alone too long, for what I think.

Thought maybe I might... - I don't think so, Sam. - [Sam] Why not? - Damn it, I don't wanna... - Shh. - I don't wanna still be gettin' picked up to go to the picture show when I'm 80 years old. - [Sam] I don't think this is the time. - I've waited for you a long time. - I don't know what brought all this on but, I thought we had a pretty good thing goin'. - Pretty good just ain't good enough anymore. - Here we go again. - What about you? Don't you wanna go someplace? Be someplace where you can do your job without havin' to answer to those damn Luddiggers every time you turn around? - I'll tell you somethin', darling.

(slow, gentle guitar music) Is Walt really your brother? - (laughs) God, no. Luddiggers took us in when my folks got killed, that's all. Me and my brother, Elmore. - That must've been awful, losin' your parents. - It was. - Why did the Luddiggers take you? - My folks used to work for 'em. We didn't have any other kin. - Yeah, I guess it was lucky you had someone, right? - I thought so too at the time. Turns out, we're nothin' but free labor. - Nah, come on, they can't be all bad. - No? Mom's crazy and Pop's drunk all the time. And Walt. - [Ryan] Yeah, yeah I know about Walt. - No you don't, either. You don't know the half. He... - He what? What? - Skip it. - No, come on, tell me Lacey. He what? - He snuck in my room one time, and he tried to make me... - [Ryan] Jesus. You tell his parents? - Ryan, you don't know what these people are like. Walt's their golden boy. - But that... - I'm tellin' you, they don't care. I think Mom's some kinda pervert herself. You should see the way she looks at me sometimes. - Lacey, you've gotta get out of here. - I've thought about it lots of times. I've thought about just runnin' away. But I can't leave Elmore. - [Ryan] How old is he? - He's 19. - Then he can take care of himself. Come to California with us. I'm serious. - Oh god. I can't. - Lacey, I'm not just gonna leave you here. Just do it, take a chance. - You really mean it? - Yeah, I really mean it. We'll get outta here now, tonight. - I'd have to pack some things. - Okay, come on. - Ryan I'm scared. - Hey. It's gonna be all right. - Well, look what the cat drug in. Come here, you. Ya see, see what your friends did to my boy. - He asked for it. He started it! - Don't you never take a stranger's part against your own people! - You're not my people. - Bah ahh! - Mom, don't. - You shut up, you little weasel. You and her are two of a kind, damn ingrates. Neither one of ya's worth a bit. Go on, get outta my sight! (groaning) Ain't ya gonna eat nothin', son? - Nah, I can't, mama. Gotta get to town before traffic from that dance hits. Save me some, okay? - Okay, honey. Be careful. - [Walt] I will. (suspenseful music) (car door banging) (engine igniting) - Oof, that was close.

(speech drowned out by window scraping) - [Mom] I ain't gonna put up with that stuff. (suspenseful music) (thudding) - Come on. How do we get outta here? - Back the way we came. - Through Luddigger. - It's the only way out. - This just gets better and better. (engine humming) - [Man] Can't you get this car outta the way up there. (horns honking) I gotta get home. Move it, cars. - You, on. - What is going on? - It's Walt! - Aww man. - Okay, hang on. (tires squealing) - Hey, stop! Hold it, now! Lacey! (laughing) - Lay off the jacket, it was a gift. - I'm sorry, Ryan, I really am. - From who? - It was sentimental, you know. - It was from me, it used to be green. (laughing) Hey, you guys hear that? - What was it? (siren blaring) Come on Ryan, stand on it, man. (suspenseful music) (tires squealing) - Damn it Walt, you want me to drive? - You wanna catch 'em before they get across the county line, don't you? - We ain't gonna catch nobody if you end up in a ditch. - Come on, man. Ryan, look out! (screaming) (radio chattering) - Out of the car, now! - [Ryan] All right, all right, man. - Hold it right there. Get outta the car, put your hands right there. Spread 'em. - [Walt] Lacey, stay in the car. - Look, I don't know what's goin' on, but we didn't do anything, man. - Spread 'em. - I'm chargin' you boys with reckless drivin' and resistin' arrest. - Sam, no! The charge is kidnappin'. Lacey there doesn't turn 18 for another month. - Come on, man. You gotta be kiddin', she wanted to go. - Yeah? Well that ain't the way she's gonna say it in court. - Walt? I want you to drive Lacey back in this car. I'll meet ya at the station. Now. (door slamming) - What are you gonna do to them? - Shut up. What's this? Runnin' off, huh? Mom oughta get a real big kick outta that. Mm mm mm, Jesus. (laughing) Damn, Lacey. You know what? Looks like I finally got you right where I want you. - Don't you dare. - Don't you give me none of that. - Stop! - You don't want nothin' to happen to that little boyfriend of yours, now do ya? (crying) - Oh god, please! - [Sam] What's goin' on here, Walt? - Just a family dispute, that's all. (door slamming) We'll finish this later. You just count on it. (banging) (glass shattering) (laughing) - Let me see you get outta here now. (humming) - Clean this mess up, now! (door banging shut) You will have a part of it. This is family business. It was your damn sister who started all of this, with her flirtin' and carryin' on like a common whore. - My sister is not a whore. - Of course she's not, Elmore. It's the Luddiggers that keep this town a fit place to bring up a young girl. Then along come these outsiders. It's them that made Lacey act like that. Now, we mean to discourage them. You stand with us, or I can't be responsible for what happens to that precious sister of yours. - Man, I don't believe this. I really don't believe this. We don't get a phone call. We got nothin' to eat. We got nothin', man. This is what we got, we got a tin cup. My old man, once he says to me, "Jails is like country clubs." Yeah, right. (tin can clattering) Hey. Hey, is anybody out there? Hey! - Drop it, Bobby, I know we got problems. - Well no kiddin', Ryan. Ryan, nobody even knows where we are. We don't know where we are. (buzzing) - It's you boys lucky day. We're gonna turn you loose. - [Bobby] Man, he tweaked my harmonica. - You all right? (harmonica music) - Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah. - What, man? We came in this way. - Your car's out here. - Huh, door to door service. - Right. - Thanks a lot. - Okay, where's the truck? - [Bobby] I don't know. (tires squealing) - [Ryan] Man, that's him. - [Bobby] Oh shit. - Stop, or I'll blow your head off! Turn around, turn around. (ominous music) Okay, go in the truck. Move it. Go on. You're gonna get in the back of the truck and lay face down. Get in. Okay, go! (tapping) (tires squealing) (suspenseful string music) Okay, come on, get outta the truck. - [Mom] Bring 'em up front. - [Walt] Move outta the truck now. Come on, this ain't no party. - [Mom] Move, now. - [Walt] Move it. - Get your butt up here. Get outta the way. Get over here. - Don't move. (laughing) - He don't look like much, does he? - No he dudn't, not now. (suspenseful string music) - You think we just a buncha dumb hicks, don't you boy? Hm? We ain't dumb. We got ourselves a nice town here, built it ourselves. And we don't want no city boys comin' in here abusin' our young girls. - Okay, you made your point. - Shut up! I'm talkin' to you. Got yourself a mom somewhere? Bet she's real proud of you, and this earring. (yelling) (grunting) (whacking) - [Bobby] Ryan! - Move and I'll have to shoot you, I swear I will. (groaning) - Bring me that sledge hammer out of the truck. Walt tells me you're some kinda Jiu Jitsu expert. When I get through with you, you won't even be able to feed yourself. Prop him up. Hold him steady. (grunting) (thudding) - Ryan! (gun firing) - [Ryan] Bobby! (suspenseful string music) - I thought he came this way. - Shh. - Why don't we look over this way? - Wait a minute, what are we roamin' around in the dark for? We'll just wait 'til it gets light and come back. - What if we don't find him then? - He's smack in the middle of the county. Even if he knew where he was goin', it'd take him a week to walk out. We'll find him, don't ya worry. I'll get him, I'll get him. - I'm just gonna sit here for a minute. (mumbling) Bobby, man. (crying) Bobby! (somber music) (engine humming) - Why didn't you just call me? You moved the bodies, you trample all over the evidence. - Sam, we was shook up. We wasn't thinkin' straight. - And you think these kids did it? - The kid's body was right there next to Elmore's. - How'd you find out all this? - When Elmore didn't come home last night, we went lookin' for him. We found his car with a flat tire. Then we seen the boys' truck stuck in the mud. Elmore musta been walkin' along, and they picked him up. - And they just decided to kill him? Why would they do a thing like that? - Probably all doped up, that's what I think. - Not that simple. For one thing, where did these kids get a gun? Another thing, when you brought the truck in last night, didn't you check it out? - Coulda been hid behind the seat. I didn't look there. - You listen to me. I'm tired of all these damn questions. Elmore was like a son to me. Now I mean to find his killer, with or without your help. - Take it easy. Now let me tell you somethin'. I'll organize a search party, and we'll find this kid, 'cause I'd like some answers too. (water trickling) (suspenseful string music) (grunting) (branches snapping) - Come on. Yeah. All right. Stop! (horn blaring) (birds chirping) Is there a phone here? - If it had teeth, it'd bite ya. (coin clanking) - Operator? I'd like to make a collect call, to New Jersey. Area code is 201-555-5247. Ryan Cassidy. I'm calling from 555, 6122. Hurry. (banging) Hello? (clacking) Hello? No way. I just tried to make a long distance call, and the phone went dead. - Long distance, huh? You probably talked to Annie, she's the operator. She'll get your party on the line and call ya back. Just come on in and set a spell. - Thanks. - Nasty things, ain't they? All slimy. That's why I hate 'em, won't even touch 'em. Customers gotta get 'em themselves. Heard a couple a kids killed a local boy last night. - Really? - Yep. Terrible thing. Took him up along Sullivan's Creek, stove his head in with a rock. - What, how long's it usually take to make a long distance connection? - Don't know, never made one myself. Reckon young Elmore put up quite a fight. Heard he killed one of 'em with a rifle. Else they killed Elmore, and then one of them killed the other. No tellin', really. Bunch of us was supposed to go huntin' for this kid. I gotta mind the store. - Where do you suppose they'll look? - Ever get around to introducin' myself? (clicking) Luddigger, Billy Luddigger. Now why don't you sit down and relax. (crashing) (groaning) You slimy things, get 'em off, you. Gah, ahh! (sirens blaring) (engine humming) He got my damn jeep! Go get him! (dramatic music) (gun firing) (crashing) (grunting) - Damn it! (pounding) Damn. - That dumb son of a bitch. He's headed right up Wolf Mountain. - That's Jefferson territory. - Yeah, yeah. Might not even have to fool with him at all. (jeep squeaking) (hissing) (gun clicking) (scraping) (eerie music) (whacking) (grunting) - What are you doin' on my mountain? (groaning) (thudding) All right, let's take it from the top. What are you doin' on my mountain? - Runnin'. - [Jefferson] From what? - The Luddiggers. - What quarrel you got with the Luddiggers? - They say I kidnapped their daughter. I didn't. They killed my friend. Hey, where you goin'? - I'm goin' that way. You, you goin' that way. - What's that way? - Away from me. You got troubles with the Luddiggers. They gonna find you, and when they do, I don't want you nowhere near me. - Did you hear what I just told you? They killed my friend. - You fight your own wars, kid. (somber wind instrument music) - [Mom] And Sheriff Frost just seems to be draggin' his feet, so that's the way things stand. You boys is here 'cause we know we can count on you to do things our way. - What about the Sheriff? - You know, the problem with Sam Frost is, he just takes hisself too deadburn serious. - Yeah, we should have no problem gettin' around Frost, what with you being Deputy and all. - Frost ain't stupid, Uncle Billy. - Yeah but, what if he gets to the kid 'fore we do? - Well the way I see it, we just make sure that don't happen. Sheriff ain't gonna get no story outta no dead man. (laughing) - I want ya to spread the word among the folks that we can trust, that the Luddiggers is gonna make it worthwhile to help. This kid is a dangerous killer. (laughs) Be a lotta folks wanna join us. Be an adventure for 'em. And remember, as far as Sheriff Frost is concerned, we ain't goin' up against him. We just go around him. (laughing) Honey, did you wanna piece of this? (somber string music) Lacey, honey. Brought ya a dessert. - [Lacey] Leave me alone. - It's your favorite. Oh come on honey, I know you're mad at me, and I don't blame ya. I admit, I was wrong. Ohh, you got the most beautiful hair. You're a beautiful girl. I can understand why that Cassidy boy fell for you. You know, it really wasn't mine to blame for Elmore, it was that other one, and he already paid for it. - Then you'll let Ryan go? - I believe we could do that. - If what? - Just be willing to testify that you was there the night Elmore got killed. Just say that... - Ryan and Bobby didn't kill him, did they? - What are you talking about? - You killed Elmore. I don't know how, but you did. I hope they hang you all. - You know what you just done? You just signed your boyfriend's death warrant. (dogs barking) (men chattering simultaneously) - All right, all right, listen up. We're goin' into two groups. Walt'll take his group up along the creek, and I'll take my men up along the falls and we'll try to hem him in. Now we got some clothes from the Cassidy kid's car for the Baker's hounds to get the scent of. That's another thing, Baker and his dogs will be out front, so I don't want anybody to get trigger happy. - Yeah boys, you can shoot that Baker but for god's sakes, don't shoot his dogs. (laughing) - All right. We got reason to believe this kid is armed. I don't want any heroics. But I also don't want him shot on sight, either. All right, let's move. (suspenseful music) (dogs barking) - Ahh. (grumbling) Somethin's got 'em confused, Pop. - Well, hold still a minute. - What do you think, Pa? - Looks like the kid was tryin' to build a fire. There's been a raucous around here. - Yeah, what do you figure happened? - Maybe the kid run into Jefferson. - Yeah, could be. - Yeah, come on, let's get 'em outta here. About a hundred yards. Go north, maybe we can pick him up there. Come on, let's go. (suspenseful music) - Dogs' got somethin'. Let's go. - [Man] Up there, there! (all speaking simultaneously) (heavy breathing) (dogs barking) (grunting) (gun firing) (banging) (thudding) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. (mumbling) That's it, boy. (dogs barking) (all shouting simultaneously) (gun firing) (dog whining) (guns firing) - God damn it. (bullets ricocheting) - Bet there ain't even a cockroach alive in there. (suspenseful music) God damn it! Gone! (rocks clattering) (guns firing) (thudding) (all shouting simultaneously) (screaming) (grunting) - [Man] (mumbling) Ya see him? - Hell fire, the time we go all the way around, that light'll be gone. - Let's head back, herd up again tomorrow, first light. - Okay boys, let's pick it up again tomorrow. - I don't mind tellin' you I don't like this. I don't like this at all. (crowd grumbling) (water splashing) - I don't like folk creepin' around my hooch. Come on down. Now. - How'd you know I was up there? You never even turned around. - Shoot. I could hear your teeth chattering a mile away. What do you want? - I'm hungry. - You know, you're gettin' to be a pain in the butt, kid. Well, gonna eat with me, you get yourself cleaned up. - Ryan Cassidy. - I'm Jefferson. - What made ya change your mind? - Let's get somethin' straight, kid. I ain't changed nothin'. I'm just feedin' you, that's all. - You know, it's funny. You don't seem like the type of guy that'd be scared of anybody. Maybe you like livin' up here all by yourself in the woods, or, maybe the Luddiggers got somethin' on you. None of my business. They sure do get their way though, don't they? Down there, I mean. I guess they don't bother you much up here. - You wanna know about me and Luddiggers, I'll tell you. (fork clattering) My mom and daddy worked Luddigger land their whole life. They owned everything, we had nothin'. My folks was older than them, but my daddy was boy to them same as me. I remember I was your age, outta high school. I was tired of it, so I got the hell out, joined the Marines, went to Vietnam. I haven't even tried, tell ya what it was like over there. I seen and done shit you wouldn't even believe. Come back home, a god damn war hero. Silver star, a bronze, two purple hearts. First day back, I run into Luddiggers on Main Street. You know what they said? Welcome home, we real proud of you, boy. I don't need that shit, Cassidy. I don't need it from them, I don't need it from nobody. - Maybe you shoulda told 'em that. - You think I was scared to tell 'em? Hell, I just spent 20 months killin' people. I wasn't scared of nobody. Nobody. It's just... I'd seen the world. And then I come home, and nothin's changed. I mean, the Luddiggers are still runnin' their little county like they always did. I'm sick of it. - What, so you came up here? - [Jefferson] Yeah, and I like it, I like it just fine. - Yeah, sure you do. - Hey, don't get in no stuff with me. - The Luddiggers are still running the county, Jefferson. They're gonna keep doing any damn thing they want until somebody stands up to them. - Yeah well, it's not my problem. - I think it is your problem. - [Jefferson] Shut up. - And that's why your so angry, isn't it? - I said shut up. - 'Cause you know you shoulda spit in their face when you had the chance, and you never did. You never did. (somber guitar music) - Still ain't eatin' huh? Pining away for your city boy? This time tomorrow, he'll be dead. (laughing) (door banging) (lock clicking) (suspenseful music) - Let's do it. Evenin', Jefferson. - What do you want? - A neighborly visit. - Three men carryin' rifles don't look neighborly to me. - Sorry. Well, this is a real nice place you got here, Jefferson... - I ain't sure what you want. - We uh, got this kid runnin' around up here on Wolf Mountain. He killed Elmore. We figured maybe you'd help us find him. - What do you need my help for? - You know the country. Look, all's you gotta do is just uh, catch hold of 'em and we'll take care of the rest of it. - Rest of what? - Why don't ya just leave that up to us, Jefferson, seein's how it is none of your god damn business. I'm talkin' to you, boy. Ain't ya hearin' me? - I hear just fine. - Ooh, that's good Jefferson, that's real good. Now I told you want we wanted, and you are gonna help us, or hell, we're just gonna have to run your ass right off this mountain, huh? (laughing) Hell, we're just gonna run ya right outta the county. - Ya hear that, Cassidy? This redneck fool wants me to help him find you. (gun clicking) - Oh I heard. - What the hell's goin' on, Jefferson? - I tell you what it is, you come into my home with rifles, tellin' me what I gotta do or you gonna run me off. That's what you said, ain't it? Well ain't it? - It was just a manner of speakin', yeah. - Well let me tell you how it is. I don't like threats, and god help anybody that come up here tryin' to run me off this mountain. That's gonna mean war. I'm talkin' widespread death and destruction, you hear me redneck, hear me? - I hear you, I hear you. - Good, good. Now you and your girlfriends run your butts on back down off my mountain, now. Now! - [Ryan] What's next? - [Jefferson] (laughing) Hey. Don't worry about it. - What you got down there? - You know, when I moved up here, I promised myself I wouldn't never gonna let nobody move me out. - Where'd you get all this stuff? - I wrote to some buddies in Nam, had 'em send me this stuff piece by piece. - [Ryan] What are these? - Claymore mines. I promised 'em a war, Cassidy, and I always keep my promises. (fire crackling) (men chattering) - George? - Huh? - I want you and Alger to cover the road between here and Sutter's Fork. The Swaringer brothers are coverin' the road up the other way. - I reckon we just uh, supposed to what, shoot 'em on sight? - Well damn right. Jefferson and that kid's armed and dangerous. Now get goin'. (engine humming) (laughing) We got 'em sealed in tight as a drum, honey poo. - Evenin', Sam. - What the hell is goin' on here? - Ain't you heard, Sheriff? That Jefferson's throwed in with the Cassidy kid. - No, I ain't heard. In fact, there's been a lotta things goin' on around here lately I ain't heard. - Now what's that supposed to... - The situation's pretty damn simple. That kid up there killed Elmore in cold blood. - You don't know that for a fact. - Elmore's dead and the kid's on the run. Them's all the facts I need. First thing in the mornin', we're goin' up there and get him. Now, are you with us, or not? - Seems to me like you got the kid convicted already. You don't need no help from me. - All right, then. You go on back home, and start writin' your letter of resignation. We'll take care of this thing our own way. - Yeah, go on, get. (soft string music) (laughing) (splashing) (suspenseful music) - Maybe we should save the rifles? - Ah, those little pop guns aren't worth carryin'. Let's get to hoppin'. (exploding) (flames crackling) No point in lookin' back now. (crashing) (scraping) Hand me that one. Ahh, yeah. (grunting) All right. Here. Give me a hand covering this up. - Huh. Now why'd Jefferson do that? He's up to somethin', honey poo. - All right. Let's keep movin'. (somber string music) (radio chattering in the background) - [Jefferson] This is Jefferson Carter. I'm on Wolf Mountain in Trapper County, located 13 kilometers south of Luddigger. If you read this, you're in the neighborhood, come in please. (radio clicking) - Dolly? - I heard about what happened between you and the Luddiggers. There's nothin' holdin' you here now, Sam. I'm leavin', and I'm askin' you straight out, are you comin' with me? - Come in please. Battery's about gone. I uh, I found this down by Sullivan's Creek. I thought you might want it. (suspenseful music) Measure the distance, aim, and let it go right here, right there. (engines humming) (gun clicking) This is for close work. Hey, both hands, get 'em up. Yeah, set the target on the sites. - Human target, Jefferson. - They killed your friend, Cassidy, they're gonna try and kill you. - That's not gonna happen. (men chattering in the distance) (dogs barking) - Damn. - I think we got 'em. Dogs are actin' like they're up there. - We oughta storm up the damn hill and get 'em. - We could do that. But it looks like that's just what they want, and I ain't up here to give murderers what they want, not by a long shot. We play by my rules. - What are they waiting for? Damn it, if they're gonna come, why don't they come? - They know we're here, they just don't know where exactly. - Cassidy, I know you can hear me. We got somebody here who wants to see you. - Come on. (smacking) (grunting) - Oh man. Jefferson, they got Lacey. - We don't want no more troubles, son, and you don't want nothin' to happen to little Lacey. Jefferson. - Whatta we do? - Got that boy? We got no quarrel with you. Come on down, nobody'll get hurt. - See you around little sister. (gun firing) (screaming) - What's wrong with you, man? - Don't you trust my marksmanship, Cassidy? - If that's the way you want it, that's the way it's gonna be. Pop. - What is it, honey poo? - Do it like I said. (grunting) - No! (gun firing) (screaming) - I gotta go down there, Jefferson. - Hey, come on! He'll cut ya to pieces before he gets five steps down that hill. - How about it, Cassidy? Do you wanna see Lacey's brains? - I gotta do somethin'. (grunting) - Gotta keep your head. - Noo! Pop, no! (gun firing) (crying) - Hold it right there, Pop. Put the gun down. Rest of ya, party's over. Go on home, now. - This ain't none of your affair, Sheriff. Damn it, Pop, shoot. - Help me! - Put it down, Pop, or I'll blow your ass to kingdom come. - [Mom] Damn it, Pop, shoot. (gun firing) (groaning) (thudding) - Pa! (crying) (guns firing) - Bastard. Let's kill that son of a bitch! (exploding) - The hell with this. (gun clicking) (dramatic music) (booming) (bullet ricocheting) (engine humming) - Now! (exploding) (groaning) (gun firing) (shouting simultaneously) They're Claymores. Welcome to the party. (crashing) Let's go. - You all right? - Whatcha gonna do, boy? - Son! - They say you killed Elmore. - What? That crazy lady, she killed 'em both. Come on. (gun clicking) - [Lacey] Look out! (gun firing) - My baby! Walt! - All right boys, it's over. Drop 'em, come on. - You done the Luddiggers dirt, Sam Frost. You and this little shit! (ominous string music) (screaming) (gun firing) (gun clicking) (thudding) (crying) (ominous music) (somber string music) - [Ryan] So Sheriff, what happens now? - [Sam] Well, first of all, I'm gonna clean up this mess. Then I've got someone special waiting for me in Capital City. - [Ryan] Jefferson, how's your arm? - [Jefferson] Oh, I'm okay. It's fine. - [Ryan] What are you gonna do now? - [Jefferson] Well, can't go home, that's for sure. - [Lacey] Ever been to California?
