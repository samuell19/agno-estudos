- Also St. Theophilus, Mother. -Yes, I didn't think of that. - Can we start, Father? - I can never remember your name. - Antonio, like St. Anthony. - How nice. To make the loudspeaker work, press the button. See? - Are you OK? - Excuse me, Father. - Would you allow me to say a few words? - Yes, Mother Superior. My dear older gentlemen.. Please remove your hats, though a bit cold. Now you will see the projection of the film of the missionary father, then you will offer yourselves foil and postage stamps that we have collected for the salvation of the poor black children. My beloveds.. My beloveds.. these documents that you will see, they are evidence of an apostolate, painful, glorious, but necessary. God weeps as long as there is one pagan on the earth. - Quiet! Silence! - God weeps as long as there are pagans! What? Silence, like this it is a scientific projection. Silence. Be still! - Change it, change it! - Immediately, father. Look, our missionary with a beautiful black woman! Look at that! Look at the scary people! - Beautiful life for a missionary, eh! - Silence! Good car. German. I had one that I bought in Monte Carlo a long time ago. But this is more perfect, however. - Rossi. - What? - Can you make this work? - Sure. I've worked with some very complicated apparatus. Well, then, I'm going to see what's to eat. - Continue it. These are already going. - Go ahead. - Then do these. - I have it, don't worry. The missionary father follows. Bloody! Reflect on what I tell you! Bloody! Excuse me. May I? Good morning. Anna. - Good morning. - Who are you? - The projectionist. - And who sent you? - The Mother Superior for the lunch. - And what lunch is that? - To eat. - Everyone is cooking. - Self service. I'll do it alone. - Peppers, potatoes, fish... - I don't like fish. Any beets? - Have a seat. - There's meat for the pizzaola. - If you'll allow, I'll taste it. - Too hot. - Meat for the pizzaiola. A favorite. If they told you for the Mother, take what you want. Yes, thanks. You go right ahead with the work, and I'll figure it out. Continue to cut, who is looking? Antonia, finish cleaning, hurry. - A few bread, please. - Here. I see that there is also cheese. A taste only. Here. -Here's the bread Very good. -I'll try a little of it. -Here's a lot of it. -I would gladly drink some wine. -Without wine, I can't eat. - I didn't think of that. Turn off the burner! -Shoo! Hasn't he eaten? -It's just a little one. He only takes a little milk. -Here's the wine. -Thanks a million. - Make room to eat. -Sunday I'll take you to dance. I am married, 10 children. If my husband heard you, he'd kill you. My compliments. But with 10 children, you can be gone to dance just the same. We'll go dancing. -Also my friend. -I'll bring you all to dance. -Dance the polka. -The polka? -But now you don't... -Eh well, this... -Teach you the Hully Gully. - I know it, but she... You know how to dance? Bravo! Also the girl we bring. OK, Miss? Miss, I'm talking to you. Don't you want to come dancing with us on Sunday? What are you, deaf? Miss, I'm talking to you. Who do you think you are, Sophia Loren? Come here. She has hair all over her body and her face. -Her mother is crazy. -Her mother is crazy? Quiet. Quiet. The hair? -But it can't be so bad. -She thinks so, and that's enough. Hairy woman, virtuous woman. Have you seen what you've done? Now look, she cries. Have you seen? -But what have I done? -She's crying. I didn't know it would offend her. Miss, I apologize. -Miss. -She's crying, so stop it. Miss. Miss, I'm sorry. I didn't know it would offend you. I apologize. -Will you forgive me? -Yes. Now that I have apologized, can I see you? Come on, don't be a baby. I'll stay here all night. -Then I'll go eat. -Let him see your face. Leave me alone. She's under my protection. -What is your name? -Maria. Maria, don't you want to show me a little? Just for a second. You must be kidding. I didn't see anything. It'll be good to see you. What's all this? It's not like we've eaten soup together. Shall we take a breath? Let's see. What did you believe I would see? What have I seen? Some beard and that's it. I have been to the Cottolengo. I have seen things like that there. It even was not worth it to stop eating. Did you see you did not kill this man? He's being affectionate. He likes you. Get married to him, eh? Yes, but she also has hairy hands. And also the body. It seems like a monkey. Like this. Why do you have to cry? Now you see, it's me who's upset... Excuse me. But wait? Who has the beard, you or me? So then I'm afraid it's me who has it. -Why are you running away? He's OK! -Mind your own business! Stay there! Be quiet, come on. Don't let it get to you. Now, turn around. Let me see. What are you doing? Starting to cry? -Here, blow. -You're bad. Blow your nose. Blow. -Do you know you're unique in the world? - I am an orphan. I have in mind certain things for you to think about... Hey, you are very beautiful, stupendous. Come to the light so I can see you better.. -How old are you? -I don't know. -You don't know how old you are? -No. -You've been here a long time? -I don't know. Wouldn't you like to go away? Tell the truth, wouldn't you? -No. But I have never gone away. - But why not? I know, because you're ashamed and... Can you leave us alone? I am speaking of serious things. Here I have my bed, I eat every day... Nonsense! You are here because you don't know where to go. But I can put you under conditions to not be ashamed anymore. Look at me. Wouldn't you like to live like the others, to come out with me? Tell the truth. Well, you'll find out that I am a genius. A genius, understand? -I'll help you get out of here. -But I... -Do you know that I am an artist? -But I'm fine here! -To shave potatoes? -I can't go out! But why not? I'll make you into an artist. They will ask you for autographs and admire you, understand? I am an entrepreneur. Do you know the Equine brothers? I was their business manager. Antonio! Antonio! I'm coming! Hold your horses! I brought the tree but these bastards won't let me get past. -There are bunches of stuff! -Signora, please. -What is this? -That's my business. You do your job and I do mine. -Where does it have to go? -Bring it to my garage. You have an interest? Can we speak one at a time, please? -Talk to me. -Then say something. -Where do you want to bring this tree? Why don't you live and let live? That means you live and let us live, you see? I'll immediately explain to you if you allow me to speak. Do we want to talk about food stamps? Of taxes on appliances? -Here we are all in common! -Ah, but always a commission to go past! Sergeant, come on. You let the tree pass. Come on, come on. -You tell us or not? What the fuck! -Forward, forward. Make way! You understand in this area there are millions, the money! Don't worry. Go on. -Do you like this, Antonio? -Next, come on. Listen! Listen! Antonio, 20,000 lira! Look at those beautiful branches! -20,000 lira! -Yes, I understand. Lower the trunk! Stop! -Here, put the plant in the hole. -20,000 lira, and I give you the tree. -Listen, where's my 20,000 lire? -Don't you trust me? -Not to trust is better with you. -Put the plant there. Alright, put it there. Don't break the branches. It's important. Maria, Maria. Get up, the tree has arrived. What are you doing there? Don't shave potatotes so early in the morning. And don't cover yourself. By now, everyone is used to it. Reveal. -But I am ashamed. -There's nothing to be ashamed of. The tree has arrived. We can start work. Give me 20,000 liras. Otherwise, it doesn't go. -I have nothing. -Don't make stupid jokes. Don't say you have nothing. The money is under the bed. -I have nothing, I swear. -Do you know you're very headstrong? For every 1,000 liras that you put in the bargain, you'll earn 10,000. Or don't you trust me? Give me. But how do you know I have money under the bed? I know everything, my dear. Give me the money because they're waiting. It's not that I don't want to give it to you, but then you'll chase me away, I can't return to the hospice and without money... What makes you say that? What are you saying? We have to work non-stop. Now, another 10,000. We have to raise the number. You shaved the potatoes. What good thing are you making for me? -Minestrone. -Good. -How are you? -Very well. -Is it planted well? -Beautiful job. Do you like it? It's original. And now you give me also a beautiful gift. -Here, here, 10.000 liras. We made the pact for 20. -You scraped the plant. -So what? I took a risk. -Be calm. -You pay the boys? -What, just pay them 2,000 lire. -What, 2000? Come on, go. For a plant like this? -What does it matter if it's scraped? -Don't be pretentious. -Don't ask me for anymore! -Let's go! Let's go! Disgraceful! "In distant Africa..." -Just a moment. -Come here. -But I am making the potatoes. - Leave the potatoes alone. Come here. This is more important. Oh, don't attack me... Good.. Come on, climb on the tree! Up! Up! You don't get it. You are the ape woman. I captured you in Africa. You are wild. Wild! You have to try to attack me when I say "Up!" with the whip. Then jump in circles and climb the tree. -But I am making the minestrone. -But what do I care? We have the tree and we have to try. We have to try to make an act.. The sooner you learn, the sooner I can return your money. Come on, don't make me angry. Try and learn. It's a show. We have to devise an act. The public pays and wants to see some things. They cannot be satisfied to look you in the face and that's enough. You have to try to learn, try to climb, to make it seem that you are a kind of Tarzan. Come on, try to climb. I tried myself, it's fine. Attack the branch, and dangle a bit. Come on. -Up! -Oh, I don't know. I don't know. Please no! -Antonio! -You only know how to do minestrone. It hurts! Go on. Get on. Antonio! Antonio, help! No, the shoulders! Let down only the arms. -Like this? -No, that's a ghost! Like a rag doll! Come on, look at him! -You need to see how he eats... -That does nothing. What do you mean it doesn't do anything? Look at him. Hey you. Move, do something. Get busy! Come on, try to imitate him. Hey, what do you say you turn over some boxes? How about getting up? How about some...? Excuse me! Disgraceful.... Did you see how he moved? You want us to stone you. What are you laughing at? The chimpanzee is dangerous. He has the strength of 50 men. You have to do like him. When the moment comes, be like a rubber band and then react like a chimpanzee. You understand? -Come on, pull down the veil. -Here? Yes, don't be afraid. Nobody can see us. Yes, a beautiful difference there. But you have too straight a nose. Do it a little bit this way. No, more! Put your tongue between you're teeth. -But I can't. I'm embarrassed. -Look what he's doing now? -Hey, do what you did before. -But it doesn't do anything. Do what you did...! Ah.. he's ruining our work. -Young man, what are you doing? -I'm joking around. -Throwing the stones at the animals? -Yeah.. That's not a chimpanzee, it's a cat. It doesn't do any stunts. -But it has rheumatism. -What? -Rheumatism. -What's that? -It jumps like a cricket. -Because you throw stones at him. -Come with me a minute. -Where? -Come to the director. -Why? Come to the director. -Come on. I paid 200 liras, I brought with me a tourist... You're right, but I'm not wrong. You come a moment with me. The beasts have a duty to perform. Even when you hit them in the head? Do me a favor and come with me. I don't feel like arguing. Put down your hands. Please go where? -To the director. -What director? -Don't lie to me. -Come on! (French) Please excuse me, madame. Yes, I'll go to the manager. -And you'll be fired! -Well, good. Go! Go do your job! Never speak.. I told you a thousand times. I dress you like an Arab so you won't be recognized, and you start speaking. Now we'll have to learn the act without the monkey. I wanted to learn, but the monkey didn't do anything... Don't cry, please. Monkeys don't cry. -I'm not crying. -Eh, you're not being smart. You have hair in the brain! When entering the dense forest, I had to take off my shoes and walk barefoot. To say it more directly, I will now take you to the place in which I found the ape woman. Here. Here, to the center of Africa. Three months of long searches. Three months in the virgin forest to track down the ape woman. Stop it, you! Three months, I said, and always going nowhere. Hey! Be quiet, I said! Stop! Sorry, she's like a wild animal. Stop it. As you know, the ape woman is an animal a little bit sexual. Come. And I will now show you, in these six tapestries, illustrations of one of the more famous painters of the city which tell of my odyssey. Six tapestries that he has reproduced impressionistically and faithfully, and which represent the six most important moments of the capture of the ape woman. My hair once again stands up at these indescribable moments. Look at this: "Struggle with the Lion", three hours. "Struggle with the Wild Crocodile", four days in the water. "Escape from the Cannibal." Observe. This is a cannibal that ate the foot of my loyal and faithful servant, but I alone escaped. What? Stop! Slave, protect the public. Excuse me, but today this phenomenon is nervous. Back! Get down! Down, for God's sake! Back, the phenomenon is tired. It needs rest. It will be prudent to send her into the pit. Get down there. Good, good. Attention, ladies and gentlemen. Carefully. It enters the cage. Please, ladies and gentlemen. Don't approach too closely. She's nervous. I'll make her enter the cage. Stay there. Don't give cigarettes. No cigarettes! Do you want her to be nervous! Do you want it to be the end of Bubu? Stay calm. Slave, keep the people back. Hold them, hold them. What did I say, ma'am? What did I tell you! Now calm, eh? Return her purse. Return it! Do you want me to kill you, filthy beast? Pick it up, ma'am. Don't be afraid to pick it up. I warned you.. prudence. Do you want to make the end of Bubu? The end for Bubu if we make the ape woman rebel. Watch! Now go inside the cage. Now make like a good monkey and hop into your cage. Inside, do you understand? Go... Dirty beast. Close it. Good, good. You come here. Come here. I now give you the candy. You may all now draw nearer to the cage. The ape woman is almost completely tame. You can also ask questions and she will answer in our language. -What is your name? -Maria. How old are you? -65. Liar, as all women. What do you eat? -Bananas. -Bananas. And no tobacco, understand? Bananas. Ladies and gentlemen, if one of you wants to touch her hair, to ascertain it's real, and to authenticate it, you can do it. Come forward. -Slave! Bring alcohol! -Yes, master. And cotton wool, because you need to be disinfected first: the hair of the monkey is very delicate and she could suffer by the contact of some microbe. So disinfect well, please. Here you go. You? Anyone? Come. -Someone wants to try... -Be brave. Come, someone. -Bravo, sir. Very good. -Here, your hands. Disinfect well. Good, this way. Touch. Touch within the limits of decency. Do you feel the softness of the hair? Like beaver! Like chinchilla! An Indian emir wanted to buy her to make a coat of it for the winter. Softy, softly. Careful with your watch. Watch out she doesn't pinch it! Enough. I am sorry but, by police regulation, I am prohibited from showing the phenomenon when she gets angry. Good-bye, ladies and gentlemen. Good-bye. Good-bye, ladies and gentlemen. Good-bye. Take the cigarettes to dry. -Good morning, explorer. -Salut, peasant. That's it for today. Not so bad. Antonio, the cigarettes. To you the part of the lion, to me the part of the mouse. Never mind. Come on. Open the cage. Antonio, top of the day. Bye. Maria, not at all badly today. A rough guess would be 8000 lire. I am very happy. Also not a bad haul on cigarettes. Who put this here? Antonio. Will you get angry if I tell you something? -What? -Swear. I swear. -Why don't we change? -Change what? The touching. It's dirty when they take advantage of it. Why is that important? But they touch me and I don't like it. I am a woman after all. It's a fixation of yours. Don't you understand that for the public you're not a woman but a phenomenon? You are the ape woman. Hey, make me some coffee. -It's already made. -Don't touch the money. Leave it alone. I have accounts to do. Doesn't it mean anything to you when they touch me? Don't I always make them disinfect with alcohol? You're fine. -I know, but the alcohol smell is bad. -If that's the worst in life.. Don't you know you are the greatest find of the century? In one month, I return to you all the money I borrowed. From the first to the last. Then I have in mind big things. I want to buy two new spotlights to make a fantastic illumination. Then music. I want also music. Hand me the sheets. -Maria. Maria. -Here. An idea has come me. Do you know what we should do? Make some photos. -Of you, you know. -Yes. Then we charge the public a fee. In costume, I think. Tomorrow I'll call the photographer, and we'll have him do it immediately. It is always necessary to have new ideas. Maybe you don't throw the banana peel in my face. -But you told me otherwise. -Yes, but here, here... Yes, I said throw the banana peel, but not in the face. That sucks. -Never mind, I can't sleep. -Don't you want a cover? You'll be cold. Don't worry about it. Why hit ever? You don't have to always snap at the public. If someone gives you a poke, what then? You can do some other thing. Lick someone's arm, for example. -That's disgusting. -Women... There is no need that you do it with everybody. Pretend. Here, try it on me. What do you want? I don't understand you, you know. You have all of this desire. You have become a free woman. I have removed you from the hospice, I have freed you from all the complexes. You can look everyone in the face... What do you want? Me, nothing. We only speak of work. And what do you want to talk about? Nothing. Go.. go to sleep. I have to think. Good night. Sit, please. Sit here. The professor will see you right away. I'll go tell him. Sir, please remove your hat. I know you'll excuse me. You see? I don't like this place. Quiet, please. Like I told you, not in the house of others. -But I am afraid. -Of what? He is a researcher who is interested in phenomenons. See, he'll make our case. And then, it serves for publicity. Instead, look at this palace I have brought you to. You never would have dreamt... From the stall to the stars. Yes... Hey, he's coming. Get up and greet him. Dear boy, it's a pleasure for me that you have accepted my invitation. You are Mr. Antonio. A great pleasure. Please sit, Mrs. or Miss... -Miss. -Charmed. I didn't know at all that there were other people here who were occupied with phenomenons. But excuse me, she is already seated. I had become distracted. The people don't understand the interest in me aroused by the study of these phenomenons. -From a biological point of view. -Certainly. My servant tells me that you discovered her in Africa. Yes, in the forest. All of my life I have devoted myself to the study of these beings, you know? -Maybe you prefer to see better... -Oh yes. No problem. Maria. I have given her the name Maria. Show yourself, he wants to see your face. Maria, reveal, please. I apologize, eh. The girl is still in the wild state. You know I've done a lot of work educating her... Hop! Hop! Maria, reveal, let's go! -Here, look well. - I have permission? Excuse me, eh. -Extraordinary. -Feel the softness. -Extraordinary. Excuse me, may I? -Go ahead, go ahead. Do you know you have a rare fortune? Rare. Extraordinary, extraordinary... Perhaps the girl would be more at home in the garden. There are bushes. Some fresh air... The professor would like to see you in the garden, or on the terrace. Is it all right? Maria? Yes, yes, certainly. She doesn't answer, but she's happy. - I do it for the lady. - It's very kind. -OK, Maria? -Well, I'll show you. Let's go. Come. Please, please. The most ancient sin of the world! And why not. A beautiful, beautiful palace. My compliments. -You like it? -The terrace is really fantastic. Yes, it is a 700 old fa?ade. Do you like it also, Miss? Yes, of course she likes it. Excuse me now, I'll draw the curtain. I don't take excessive confidence with seamstresses. Don't you feel it? This man is crazy. Quiet! He's a true gentleman. You just can't tell. Do you remember what to say? Where were you born? -In the forest. -But where? In the virgin forest, in Africa. And who discovered you? Me. -Would you like to get more comfortable? -Yes, thanks. -This is my small garden. -One small jungle in the house. Very kind. I am sure we can come to an agreement between us, yes? Of course, professor. Come, Miss. Don't be afraid. You must think of me as a friend. Look how green, marvelous! And to think that we are in the heart of the city! -Can you? -May I? -Please. -Thank you. This is my preferred angle. This garden so green... And then there is water. Can you feel the flow of the water? I like it so much. Do you think I can remove this cowl? I would like to see... - May I? - Please, look more. But I see that the hair continues... Certainly, this is the characteristic. Otherwise, it would be a simple bearded woman. Here we have instead almost a chimpanzee. The whole body is a kind of forest of hair that... You think that I could see? Some more? Absolutely. Maria, the professor has a need to see some more to better analyze, shall we say, the phenomenon, here. There. See? You can see the continuous hair on the whole body, on the arms... Show me. Let me see, let me see.. I have also given her an undergarment. Like a woman. Can you turn over here? Turn, turn. Good, good. Wait. I would say a cross between a quadrumane and a black. I don't believe so, teacher. I don't think so. Why does she have blond hair then? Perhaps an explorer with a monkey... -Well, maybe. -An ape, perhaps. Can I see some more of the muscular makeup? Yes, certainly. The professor would like to analyze more. Take it off. -No. -What no? Take it off. -No. -Don't make me crazy. -Excuse me, but it is... -Perhaps you should insist. She's an animal, but also she has some modesty. -Try. -Don't make me upset! -I said no. -Why? What's wrong? -There's nothing special to see. -Listen, let him. Come with me. All the phenomenons, at times, they have some timidities, almost as if they were human beings. It's natural. So, I get the impression this phenomenon has not begun yet her sexual life. -Come again? Excuse me? -I'm saying she's an innocent, no? -She's not had sexual relations? -No, I guarantee it. -For sure? -I promise you. Well, if you could be persuaded to leave the phenomenon here with me for a few days, so that I can study it in its true love life, and developmental ability. -You understand what I mean? -Yes, I understand very well. Look... What I mean is.. I am prepared to surrender my phenomenon for scientific studies. But you have to understand that I have put on her what is called a working act. We work every day... You ask an indemnification contract? OK, I am ready to make one. But it's not so much a question of character study as of material loss. In short, to stop the show is a damage of about 20,000 lires a day. 20,000 lira? All right. But in case the observations were to prolong, in that case... Certainly it is a disadvantage for me. Stop my show for a few days.. And, in this case, it is unfortunately most of the show... I am always prepared to surrender the phenomenon to science, but in this case, I would not know... It is not a show anymore, do you understand? I can surrender the girl for study of personal character, but even though scientific... It would be the first time. Can you guarantee me anything? -100,000? -For three days? -For two. -Not three? I have already explained that I would do anything for her, but.. All right. Let's do it and not say any more about it. It might be a good idea to see how the girl feels.. -Certainly. -I'll tell you up front... she's guaranteed for two days.. but if I was to prolong the matter.. -150. -All right. -I'll get you a check. -I'll tell her. -It's necessary to get her feeling. -All right. All right. -Maria. -What is it? You know, I had a discussion with the professor. He desires you to remain here for a few days with him. -I don't want to. -It's not a discussion. He would like you to remain in his house. He wants to study you a bit. He'll pay us. And you know that we need a lot of money. -Yes, but I'm not staying. -Stop contradicting me. -Why do I have to stay? -Why? Enough. -But why? -Because this is our job. And you have to do it also. The professor is kind. -Why don't you want to remain here? -Because I don't. -Why? You've been alone with me. -Yes, but... -Then why not with him? -It's not the same thing. -Why not the same thing? -Have you seen how he touches me? What do you mean? He's touching you because he's a professor, a researcher.. -Don't you know you're a phenomenon? -I'm not a phenomenon but a woman. Don't speak so loudly. I tell you that you have to remain here. -I'm not going to. -I'm responsible for you. I say you have to remain. Look at me. -I'm not staying here. -You have to remain here. -Not staying here! -We'll get money! -You have to stay for this, understand? -I'm leaving! Leaving! -Quiet. -I'm leaving! -Not so loud! -I'm leaving because you're a pig! -Smile for the professor. -He is also a pig! -Be quiet! -Two pigs! I'm leaving! -Where are you going? -Two swine! Two pigs! -Excuse me, professor. -I'm leaving! Come here! Hop! Hop! Come back! Hop! -Lower your voice. -I'll be right back. -Your are in my house. -The phenomenon is a little bit nervous. No scandals. Please, I cannot have any scandals. Go now. Who knows of this? Go. Don't worry. I'll immediately bring her back. That damned monkey! I'll kill you! I'll destroy you! -Cretin! A cretin! -Antonio! -Who is it? -Maria sends you this. She wants her suitcase and her savings book. She sends me this and wants money! Here's what I do to her stuff! And the contract? She believes she can break a contract this way? On a whim? How fresh! I have not built all this for nothing. Tell her that I give her 24 hours to return here. -Unhand the messenger! -Otherwise I will denouce her! For breaking the contract, and other bad things. Maria told me to return with the suitcase and the book. Ah, yes? The girl has told you? Then tell the girl she has 24 hours to return here, if she values her suitcase. -No book either! -The arm, please! What do you want? This is my business! I'll tell on you! Mother Rosaria! The savings book, eh? Beautiful poetry, yes. But she'll have to return here. -Mother, I have insisted... -Have a seat, Mother. The suitcase and the savings book, now! One moment, I'll explain everything to you calmly. No! Do it now! The suitcase and the savings book! -He wanted to beat me! -But what a beating! -Nudity! What a horror! -No, no nudity. I guarantee it. -No nudity, no way! -What a scoundrel! Listen, I won't tell the police because it repulses me to say these ugly things. -But if you persist... -I'll give you the book and the suitcase. But on the bargain that the professor must make me creditable. - Creditable! - I didn't know him! It was the professor. Suddenly... -What have you to laugh about, evil one? -You are a monster of wickedness. What you have done to that poor creature is inexcusable. -Inexcusable. -It was the professor.. It was a misunderstanding of my good faith... Where are you going? Leave those suitcases! -Come, don't listen to him! -You leave them! I bend, but I don't break! Come in. -Jesus christ be praised. -As always. What is it? I am Antonio Setola. Do you remember? -I already know your history. -First, I have to apologize.. -There is nothing that can be done. -You don't have to forgive me, but I have to absolutely speak to you. Don't killers get a trial too? I bring you this small offering for the memory of that holy woman, my poor mother. You can give it to the old folks, or for mass. Nobody could interpret better my mother's desire. There are 10,000 lira, a small thing, according to my possibilities. Please. Thanks a million. Mother, I have to talk to Maria. I absolutely owe it to speak to her. -Maria is calm. Leave it alone. -Yes, but I am not calm, however. I feel guilty for a thing that I have not done... I feel guilty for something I haven't really done. I can't eat, sleep, or live with myself anymore. -Mother Superior.. lunch. -Coming. We are ready for the taste. You were very rude a few days ago. -Yes, yes, go now. -Very good, thank you. -Thanks. -Realize the situation. -But I realize it. -There are moral obligations. -Yes, I know. -You are not Maria's family. And therefore she cannot live with you as you are a single man. I am prepared to do everything. I can adopt her. Adopt her? Do you know how many old men come here to adopt young girls of 14 and 15 years old? Well, first of all, I'm not old. And Maria's not a child. -Excuse me, Mother. -But what assurances can you give? -You are a bachelor. -Granted. Granted, but I take my responsibilities seriously. I offer all guarantees, Mother. No believe me, trust me on this. Maria is a good and brave girl. Renunciate forever. It's impossible. Really impossible for her. -Is the microphone ready? -All prepared. Take care. We agree. Along the road up to the door of the house, you'll sing. You'll sing the song that I taught you, "La Novia." - From the church to the house. - I don't want to sing. Why? I think everyone will laugh at me as your wife. Just do what I do. Come on, let's go outside. You won't do all those things you did before. Sing and smile. Come. -Hooray for the bridegroom! -Hurray! Turn on the microphone. Turn it on. "La Novia." One, two... White and bright... I'm embarrassed. White and bright.. La Novia goes... White and bright.. La Novia goes... Thank you, people. ...hidden among the crowd.. ...behind the tears... ...undecided... I see my dreams die... Touch me, creature, and make me holy. How beautiful she is. Now that I see you, how holy. There, on the altar, she is crying... Hey, hey! Be civilized, for God's sake! ... everybody will say that is of joy... .. while her heart is shouting. Ave Maria! Where are you going? We have to go this way, please. Go on, sing, sing. Ave Maria! Steady. Hold steady. Let's go back! Dessert for everyone! Let's go! -For everybody! -Antonio, let's go home! Whoa! What are you doing? What are you doing. It's like.. -Have you gone crazy? -I am your wife. But what a wife! We are a company. -I want to be your wife! - You've drunk too much. -I'm a woman! -Now let's stop this. And also I am the cook. I do the minestrone, make like a monkey... I climb on the tree and all... -I don't like that! -Stop it! I do all that you command me. I sing, I climb, I show my ass. But I'm speaking with respect. I'm your wife! But you know why we got married. Everything like before. Continue exactly... Stand still! As before! You're very smart but you don't get certain things. Now she cries because I have to sleep. Tomorrow will be like every other. But really, you just want a good time, right? Come on, Antonio. -But I am sleepy! -Come! Maria, let's act seriously, please. Antonio, come. -Come -Let it be. -Come. -Forget what I said. Don't you understand why you're not like any other woman? I am not a woman, I am a phenomenon. Come to bed, Antonio. For a man it's different, do you understand? You are still like a child and certain things you cannot understand. But you see, you have to adapt. We're married.. you forget I have to sleep now. -Come. -Don't you see what we're not? The bed is small. Look, we can't. Tomorrow, I'll buy a beautiful great Latvian, and tomorrow we'll do everything. But now... Let me go. I'm going. And tomorrow I ask for the annulment of the marriage. -What? -I ask for the annulment. Is that what they taught you in that awful place? You want to put it in your head about a love I have for you... I love you, but like a brother to a sister. It's not the same thing. I understand. But when this morning you told me to sing, you said: "You are my wife, sing." And I have sung. Now you are my husband and you have to sleep here. All right, wait. I don't understand these things that come into your mind. Annulment of marriage... Have you gone crazy? Yes, of course, we are married, but certain things must be taken slowly. Look, I'll be comfortable here, I'll be close. -But it is uncomfortable. -No, I'm good with the hardness. -But you will be cold. -Oh no. Antonio. I love you. You don't understand anything. -Antonio, you asleep? -Yes, I'm sleeping. Antonio. -What is it? I was sleeping... -Beautiful. -What is it you want? -You.. come.. -That's crazy talk. -But why? I already told you. You and I are like brother and sister. But it's not true. We are husband and wife. -Oh no... -Oh yes... -Come on, let me sleep. -Come here. Come here. -Not there. -Yes. -Tomorrow we'll have a great Latvian. -Come. -I am not prepared. -Come. But it's sheer madness. It's sheer madness, I know. -You know I'm a nice guy? -I do, little baby. -Not here. -Yes. You have a pretty big head, you know. You're tickling me. Mr. Antonio! Mr. Antonio. -Marcellos Pompa. -A pleasure. My wife. A pleasure, ma'am. Please, sit. Very important we have great variety. Look here at the Saloon Margherita. The great glories of the Neapolitan variety show passed through here. From Donnarumma to Pasquariello. Do you feel the music? The commander has come just to engage us. By now we have won. The money is ours. Don't be afraid. -But I don't know how to sing. -Oh no? You know how to sing very well. But you always underestimate, darling. Wrong! Absolutely wrong. In Paris this doesn't go. Come on, leave him alone. Need anything? -No, thanks. -Have you seen the phenomenon I brought? -Maestro, "La Novia." -Excellent! The barefaced way is beautiful. Really beautiful. Excuse me, Maria knows a lot of songs, but unfortunately the maestro has only "La Novia." -You feel like hearing "La Novia"? -Just a bit. Please forgive if she seems so excited. -No, it's fine.. -Thanks. Good. Ready? -Yes, yes. -Thanks. Maestro, "La Novia." Silence. Bright and white.. La Novia goes.. while hidden... An angel with hair! Beautiful! Beautiful! -Beautiful voice, eh? -Paris is bored by now. With sex they are nauseated. Sex, sex, always sex. They want something "lively." Stronger. Here it is. We'll prepare for them a great act: The angel with hair. And I am ready to immediately sign a contract for the exclusiveness of this lady. But excuse me, commander, this act we must do together. Yes, we work as a couple. I'm the one who has built the act. Alone my wife doesn't work. Listen, we now.. All I want for her is to get naked a little. -Hey, not completely naked. -No, look. I'm sorry but my wife doesn't strip. -My wife naked in Paris, no. -Be quiet. -We can come to an agreement. -It's all wrong. Mine is a scientific act. I apologize so much. Good morning. -We're going. -Look, you'll regret it. No, you look, we have been wrong here. It's a matter of moral principle. We are a regular church-married couple. -France is another mentality. -Let me ask you, dear. This is important!. I am also Italian, as you. Italian, in fact. Be patient. -Come. Listen to me. -No, we won't speak of a contract. -My wife is not to be introduced naked. -Allow me to persuade. Kind lady, see here. Let's start by sitting here. -Get some chairs, now. -Immediately, commander! Sit here. Sit, kind lady, please. Have a seat, commander. Is it all right? Ma'am, I immediately tell you that the striptease is not a thing... -I'll leave you alone, commander. -Not a serious thing. See, in Paris, there are women. The striptease is what they do. Mothers of family, honest wives... yet they do the striptease. -But I think that it is a dirty thing. However, I am a woman. Who decides it is my husband. -No, we are two. You are my wife. -Looking for me? Yes, dear. We'll take you both. According to you, I should send my wife this way? -Why not? -No, it's a mistake. We're going. Look, come on. Have patience one minute. Look. I'll show you, ok? Here, do me a favor and tell me what is so bad to be seen this way. Nothing, nothing at all. She's a figurine. A figurine of flesh. -Listen, what should I do? -What do you know? -I do some Afro-Cuban dances. -Good. Later you do an Afro-Cuban dance for me. -Pasqu?, don't get too excited. -You see. And my wife is to waddle this way for Paris? No, I laugh at that. But I didn't say she had to get totally nude. No, but think of the money. All the money that you would earn. But the only complaint is Paris. A similar creature... It could be the world. The world. An act that the whole world will want to see. While here in Naples, you are lost. The money! The money! You beard and hair do us well here. Does the lady also want a massage? Let's do it. Where you like it: here to the cerebellum. You know it feels like that of children. -Will I get used to life in Paris? -For sure. -That city frightens me. -All the world is a country. We'll go like beggars, live like lords and ladies.. have a regular contract, beautiful writing... There you are. Does the lady have other orders? We remove the bib... Careful of the beard artist here. If the nuns knew that I go to Paris to do the striptease! What do you care what the nuns think now? You're married to me. But you know I don't believe my good luck. You better believe. How many times I have told you what a genius I am? How many? -Yes, but I am sad. -Why? To leave the house so, now that it's just right... Certainly this house has cost me a little bit of sacrifice. And the theater... Come. Ladies and gentlemen, the show will now begin! Here is the forest. How much effort, how much sacrifice. You remember the ape woman? All over now. A new life! This is the life of the artist: one day here, the other in Paris... Then, even another day to New York, who knows. Let's go to our Latvian, come on! But how shall I do in Paris? I've never been out of Naples. You will become accustomed to it. Our beautiful Latvian! I'm sorry, won't I be there too? And the life of hotel always... -Will we also go to America? -Sure. To America... everywhere. Meanwhile, we have our beautiful photo in the newspaper. They are always satistying. France Soir - a million copies circulate. -A million photos, think of it. -A million! -What's written there? -"Look, the brave man who married a monkey!" Father! Father! Father! Papa! You must die! No. No... No! No! Go away! Devil! Look at it... The cochonnette... Look at it... Go away. Come here. Yes... Yes... Yes. Oui... Shit! And there you go! Bravo! Bravo! And here is the ape woman! Hello everyone! Must have been the oysters. -How's it going? -Not bad, thanks. The legion of honor! And you, Franceschina, how are you? -Forget Franceschina, go! -Yes, I'm going, I'm going. Neapolitan... Hello! Hello! What's good today? -To me, the usual. -Of course. -Maria, how's it going? -Fine. You remember me? I am Antoine. -You remember? -Yeah. -Work, it's good? -Yes, thanks. Good sandwich, eh? Good, good. The chicken croquettes, as yesterday. With a little watercress. -I like that a lot. -OK. The duck tonight is really disgusting. Goodnight, miss. Do a good job. Ah, your bouquet! The bouquet, mademoiselle! Just need five minutes of rest. -Mademoiselle, your bouquet. -Thanks. Like Santa Lucia, I'll remember this view. -Bye, Antonio. -Bye, bye! Bye, bye! -Finally. But where were you? -Nowhere, just over there. -Yes, messing with the black girl. -No, come on, she is a colleague. Yes, a colleague... All are colleagues for you. -I want to know what she said to you. -Nothing. "Bring me the bouquet." So I brought it. -You kissed her. -But what a kiss! A colleague I was kissing... Hurry, we're late. The women have another mentality. They think here a different way. Understand? You are different from the others... Yes, but I don't kiss. I don't kiss anybody. You're right. You don't kiss anyone and you don't get kissed. -What is this? -Antonio! -Come on already! -I'm coming! The misery! Oh there there, little piggy... I don't feel well this evening. This double program kills me. - I have a bellyache... -Be patient a little longer. Tomorrow we'll call a doctor. You always exaggerate. It's probably the oysters. Oh no, it really is my belly... Certainly the time is disgusting. Always grey. It puts a sadness on me... And down there the cemetery, That must be the doctor. Give me this. Here, get ready. Can't you take out those curlers? It's bad to be seen by the doctor in curlers... Be ready, eh? -This is the doctor. -Bonjour. -Come on in. -(translating) Go in. Come in both of you. -Good morning, ma'am. How are you? -Bonjour. This way, this way. Thank you, Elvira. -What's he saying? -He says "It's a monster." -Sorry, ma'am, about the monster. -We know all about it. Do I need to repeat that too? Madame doesn't understand French. Excuse me, ma'am. The doctor wants to know if it runs in the family. Basically, if your mother was this way. Tell the doctor it's not the head but the stomach we're interested in. -The vomiting, the nausea. -You understand, doctor? They're not interested in the head, but the illness of the stomach. Madame, don't be concerned. A nice purge and tomorrow like new. -What's he saying? -He expects her to undress. It's all right. -Sir, please... -Yes, yes. Miss, come. What is it? -You tell me what happens. -Nothing. It's something doctors do. All right. Don't look. Don't look. To look is bad. It makes a bad impression. But are we being punished? I am her husband after all, no? Mademoiselle! "Have you had sexual relations with the lady?" Certainly.. it is my wife. Why shouldn't I? -Are you sure? -Am I sure? Why wouldn't I know? Yes, I know, but I didn't want to say anything. I am a discreet woman... -Yes or no? Yes, doctor. They have had relations. Good, thank you. -It hurts, doctor. -I'm sorry. Ugh, that beard! "Tell me, miss, have you had sexual relations?" What, me? I am single. Wouldn't that be nonsense? Sir, Madame is pregnant. Oh, the lady is pregnant! Beautiful! Congratulations! You hear that, Antonio? I expect a child. Are you happy? -Very happy. -My compliments! A little kiss. You feel lots better now, eh? -Please, let's talk. -A towel. I am really happy for you, dear beautiful lady. Quickly, miss. -Sir, please? -What? He says he needs to talk to you because the situation is serious. Obviously, the case is not the usual. -Ask how much. -Three. But that's not the issue. You are.. thank you. You are a man, so you must know the situation -He says you are a man... -Excuse me, but.. -Not so.. -Not so.. easy. And the issues are quite difficult to foresee. He says that it is better that we go talk in the corridor. Let's go out there. Be back soon, ok? -So? -Mademoiselle, tell him... -Translate for me. -It's coming. The circumstances are a bit peculiar. By weighing the laws of heredity, the child may be born too heavy. -Poor lady! -A monster, for sure. What did he say?! That it will be necessary to bring her to the clinic because a monster will be born. A child comes as its mother, with all the hair on its face. A monster! A monster! Poor lady, such a good person and so nice! It's just like life... Will you tell Monsieur that he needs to decide. I could give the address for an abortion. I am a lady and won't say these things. No, no! I am a good woman. There are the shoes. Do you really want them shined now? -Bullshit! You irritate me! -Great guy, there he goes. Will you translate what the doctor said, please? - I am a good woman. -I know that. But if you'll just do me a favor until we're done. You should abort it! OK? Abort it, and that's all. I can never tell her these things. And now I wished I never even heard about it. -To have to tell her about abortion.. -Is it true? For me, yes sir. You do what you want, but I don't see any other solution. -But it's impossible. In Italy.. -In Italy perhaps. But, for me, here we must do it. See you later.. if you choose. -Maria. -Yes, Antonio. You know, perhaps that thing there can't go on. What did you say? -The doctor says you have to abort. -Abort? But that's crazy! Why should I abort? Because... Because you know why. Because it seems that... it would be an unfortunate. Because it will be an unfortunate, that's a reason? What do I know? Unfortunately, you know it's the way things go. The doctor said it, and if he said it, he should know. Doctors are also wrong. And if it is an unfortunate child, isn't it ours? Yes, I know. You think I don't know that? Don't you understand? It's not me who wants it. -It was the doctor's idea. -The doctor is a monster. The doctor is a monster... Try to think. Come on, Maria. I'm happy we're having a child also, but what if it's born and is a poor wretch. Then what? -But it won't be a poor wretch. -We're not only thinking about us, to be selfish, we also think about the child. -It will be a wretch. -Then I am also a wretch. But also I am happy. Haven't I found you? Haven't I gotten married you? I am happy. -You're not happy with life? -Yes, I'm content. So? However it's not so easy to find one like me, believe me. -Why? -Why? Forget it, go on. -Here. -Always this pasta with butter. The French butter I don't digest well. It stays in my stomach. But there's nothing else. Here. Oil, do it with oil. I'll eat it unseasoned. Go on, eat. -Eat, eat! -I'm not hungry. I'm not hungry... What's not to eat? She serves anything, but won't eat anything. Eat! -You like the butter. -No, I don't like it. I want nothing. What do you think? That I thought this up? For me it would be a straight bargain. Don't you believe me? You, the child, both hairy. We'd make a lot of money. You're so small! You only think about business. Only the money! You are the monster! Stop it, now! Stop it! Wretch! You're hysterical. I forgive you because you're hysterical. Go away, monster. I'm enough for my child. I'll bring it to the doctor. I'll take care of it. What you won't do. You throw all the pasta on me. You're hysterical. No, I am not hysterical! I'm a poor wretch! I'll go away with my child.. We're going to the Hotel Sayonara. Beautiful and comfortable. -Yes, as you want, Antonio. -Good. We now turn right. Antonio, turn right. -Why to the right? -I want to petition a saint. I told you already, that's just a superstition of yours. Yes, superstition... For Carla, carrying milk to the hospice.. She had a paralyzed hand and went there.. -But is it really necessary to go there? -Yes, I beg you, please. Good morning. What do you want? -Good morning. I want to order some prayers. -First and last name? -Maria Setola. What's he writing? -Address. -Hotel Sayonara. -Don't be funny. -You want the police here? What do you want? Don't you know we pay taxes here? We have to keep records. If you have a protest, take it to City Hall. What sad eyes that you have. Are you Moslem? -Moslem? -What have you brought here? A Moslem person? I pray only to the saints that are in heaven. And what are these practices? First name, last name, address... -..or is there some confusion up there? -No, it is not there above, it is here. I pray only to the Catholic saints. Go sign up, with faith. Amount of offering? -How much do we do? -One hundred. We are returned from France. We have only francs. 100 francs. Let's see the exchange.. You see how they are organized? What are you doing? Calculating the exchange rate? Sailors come here from all the parts of the world. And if every time we have to go to the bank to exchange, we'd suffer. Don't worry. You must prove everything, otherwise they come to protest. What you have written remains, to prove motive. -Specify motive. -For the salvation of a child. Oh, I'm sorry. A child, is it? Is it alive, dead, or not yet born? -It still waits to be born. -To whom do you want prayers addressed? To Saint Anthony or to the Madonna? How beautiful.. What do you think? I would say both. It's better. Well, are you decided? To St. Anthony or to the Madonna? To both equally. Recommend me. -It's an urgent thing. -Please, father has to pray. Done, ma'am. Thank you. Maria. -Look at that beautiful child. -You are really a crazy person. Do you like it? I cut out a lot, you know? I was the news agent. These are by me. Here's one with a baby bottle that is very beautiful. You like it? -You must always look at this picture. -Do I need to? Certainly, it's a matter of suggestion. If you want your child to be born very beautiful as this, you always have to look at the photo, and don't get tired of it. I am practical on these things. But I'm here looking and I'm not calm. But you have to be calm. Darling, think about nothing else. You don't owe us to think. You have enough to do looking at the photo. Don't worry. Who knows what your mother thought when she was pregnant with you? -Hey, is it kicking yet? -It does. Strongly! He's bad. This hotel is expensive. We'll end up penniless. You want to leave? Where then will our child be born? In the middle of the road? At least here there is some elegance, sun... Don't break my head for these things. Look. Look at the plaza, the panorama, be distracted, have a good time, understand? -Yes, yes. -I'll think about the rest. -But I am worried... -I'll find a way to make money. We're paid up to the end of the month here. The car I have practically already sold. But the car serves you, Antonio. It goes. I didn't have it before, I don't have it now. Who cares? Maieroni arrives soon... After it's born, we start working again. -Of course. -What a story! -How goes it? -Good. -I'm losing hair. -A few hairs. It's not anything. It's like the doctor said: it's the pregnancy. Later there'll be more, don't worry. Do you know what he told me? He once had in care a bald woman. During pregnancy, her hair grew like a beatnik's. Stay here. I'll attach the picture and be right back. I don't believe the poor lady has any hope of being saved. Certainly scientifically, it is a very interesting case. Very interesting. I will do a publication for the university. It will do very well, also in the interest of science. It will do a lot of good. He's coming. Here comes Mr. Antonio. My sincere condolences. Your daughter, as you know, died. Better so, however. For her and for the lady. I have no interest in the child. Tell me of the mother. Listen, there are few hopes. Her condition is serious. You can get near to her, speak, comfort her.. Sit, Mr. Antonio. Sit. Be brave and sit. Be brave. Maria. Maria. She can't really speak. Don't tire her. -Is it true, I'm very sick? -No... The doctor says that perhaps tomorrow I can bring you home. - I am very sick. -Don't say it, at least. -I'm all broken. -No, come on. And our child? Our child... -It's fine, it's all well. -And beautiful. How is our child? Don't worry. Our child is well. It's normal. It's beautiful, you know. It doesn't even have a hair, nothing. The whole head, all bald. You know how those photos... That photo with the baby bottle that you liked... It's there now, in the incubator. It's beautiful? Very beautiful, like I said. It has a large head... Smooth.. It seems like a billiard ball. Come, be brave, Maria. Perhaps you can also see it tomorrow when they remove it from the incubator. Maieroni has sent to me a telegram. I have it here in my pocket. Now I'll read it to you. Now, it says.. No... Be brave, Mr. Antonio. Be brave. Be brave. Come on. Come, come on. Be strong. Why? -Why? -Because it's over. -Get that buffoon and bring him to me. -Don't worry. The newspapers give too much credit to these wretches. -With this poster you cannot enter. -I'll keep it as long as I like. Too bad for her. You, go away! Hey, I'm participating in the protest! -Sit down! -It's a matter of conscience! -I'm sitting. -Stay calm. I am calm, but she's not at peace, because there's no clean conscience. That's why I'm not calm. This is a museum. -Not a market. -I know. Here we collaborate with science. Don't you understand what a museum is? Haven't you mixed it up with a sideshow? Here, scientists come, students, couples on honeymoon... You have not understood science. Why? Before, you made a gesture of collaboration, now you recant it. Because I want to bury my wife in a Christian manner. I have baptized her, I have married her regularly in the church. I don't want her to remain here in a museum. I want back her. -I have the right, see? -The right? He speaks of the law! Everything stays. You signed! What did I know? In that moment, I was incapable... -Don't play victim. Watch it. -I never saw the papers. De Rosa, give me form 415, come on. Sign this. You'll have to return the expenses for her maintenance. -I'll get it to you, don't worry. -Sign here. When I give my word, I keep it. I am not a clown, remember that. Does it seem a proper place to you for a mother and her child? This is a worthy place. But now, go. De Rosa, accompany the gentleman. Second floor, Mammalian department. At the top of this staircase, second door to the left. Will you stop that damned noise! Villain! Excuse me. -Good morning. -Have you come for the lady? -Yes, I am the husband. -Very good, this way. -Do you have a document? -I have the identification papers. And now the respectable public can see the certified documents proving the truthfulness of the facts. International Declaration of Customs! Big Game Farm. "Pruvuruti"... which means "Animal Transport." Certified Residency in our city, and other documents. On the inside, you can admire the ape woman's body and of her son lovingly embalmed, I say embalmed and preserved at the expense of the State. Listen! Look here! Fucking clown! Do you have permission? I'm allowed to work here as much as you are! But go somewhere else to be funny! This is a scientific show! Professor, come here. Why not allow this? I'm amazed at his suffering, his pain. Let him work. Go on. Now, the illustrious explorer, overcoming his pain, will show you inside his memoirs. This spectacular, ladies and gentlemen, will now begin! Tickets at the box office! Come on, put the record on. Ladies and gentleman, respectable public, I am at your disposal.
