(This is a "BUCIUM") CIPRIAN PORUMBESCU 400 years have passed since the ruler of Moldova, Stefan Voievod, the righteous erected this holy shrine (Putna Monastery) and hordes and invaders from all over the world came upon us. But this flame, unquenchable in her eternity, will burn forever. It rises, burning, in the heart of our nation. "The morning star" of the romanians, torch in eternity, Father Iraclie. Because, badie Mihai (EMINESCU) "All of them became water and earth (died) as soon as they came here" (from a poem by MIHAI EMINESCU - the greatest romanian poet) (MIHAIL KOGALNICEANU) You, the ones who will be the great romanian personalities and those who will come after you, rulers of our country you are obliged to keep always awake with faith the flame of the great Stefan! "Oh, mountains and deep valleys, oh, give me your sublime voice My soul is sad But the poet doesn't sing He cries and then says: "Oh, Stefan, you're great even at your grave!" (Comunist Propaganda) It's in the mountains, plain from distant angles from fairs, municipalities, hamlets a people of the same pure blood comes at the celebration and to pray together. (HORA-romanian traditional folk dance) Vinirau! Hold it, Mr. Ciprian, the officer wants me to "scratch" his back with the bow. That's enough, Vinirau, stop it! The emperor approved to celebrate the saint patron of the monastery, to pray, but don't exaggerate! "Herr" officer, today is our celebration! We laugh and cry, we do what we want at least every 400 years! We arrived in Putna? Yes, Dad. Resting place in the heart of Father Iraclie. Hans! Hans, stop! Stop, don't you hear? Who is the young man who plays the violin? It's young mister Ciprian. Son of Father Iraclie of Stupca. Father! Father! Now I can die! I played to the whole of Dacia! Boy! Thank you, Mr. Ciprian! In your hands the violin is a queen! The Lord has placed in you boundless thoughts! These are the songs and feelings of our people, Mr. Eminescu! The Habsburg Empire did not succeed to enslave them... As for thanks, what more can we say. WE owe you, Mr. Eminescu. And you, Mr. Slavici. And the entire committee of "Young Romania - ROMANIA JUNA" for organizing today's festivity. And I am deeply thankful, Mr. Kogalniceanu because you have come near us, those who carry the heavy yoke of humiliation for a century. Ciprian! Ciprian, Bertha has come, run, come with me! Forgive me! Come on, run! "Come to the forest at the spring that trembles on the rock"... (Poem "Desire" by Eminescu) Bertha! My respects. Welcome, Pastor Gorgan! I'm so glad to see you too, here at our celebration! We are passing to Suceava. and we found it our duty to honor for a moment the patron saint of the holy place of Putna. Tomorrow we return to Ilisesti and we are waiting for you with us. Thank you, Pastor. Unfortunately, until tonight we have to be in Suceava. Tell Father Iraclie to forgive us for not being able to stay longer. and send him all my love and friendship. Come on, Ciprian, because Father Iraclie... Come on, sit down, guys, sit down! Hello. Hello, old Chifore. Come on, sit down at the table. Thanks, but I came for a different matter. Receive this violin, Mr. Ciprian. Take it, because its time has passed for me, just as my time has passed. It's a special violin, take it. Today you stirred my soul in me. It was given to me by a wandering gentleman during the difficult times of 1848 as a price for disturbing his soul with my songs. Its sweet voice delighted hearts and ears and many tears were shed. But, now, as an old man, life is silent, and poor one, doesn't play anymore. And sir Ciprian, who plays like noone else the "hora" and our "doina" will carry them worthy in the world. Ciprian! Marioara, Ciprian's colleagues from Suceava came! Slow down, boys! Call them inside, Marioara! Slow down, boys, you're going to overthrow the whole village! And they will put you in the prison, in Suceava! Come here! Ciprian is not at home, he is with Pastor Gorgon from Ilisesti, but I'll call him immediately! I'm gone! No, please, Bertha. Don't try to make your father angry. You know very well that he does not allow anyone to sit next to them while he plays. It was wonderful, Mr. Ciprian! I held you back too much, but we haven't seen each other in a long time. Please don't say that, Pastor. The evenings in your house make me happy. I have the impression that my violin fills with the spell and sings alone. Please, Mr. Ciprian... It's the pastor's favorite jam. Berta picked the raspberries. And you weren't afraid of bears, Berta? Raspberries grow for them. I die of fear, but when I go up the mountain I take sugar with me. Please, please take a seat! Thanks. Please, Dad. Thanks. We arrived! Ciprian! Marioara! Excuse me.. Berta! Marioara! Ciprian, your colleagues have come from Suceava! How are you, brother? Did you switch to Anglicans? One moment! Sir..organist... Doesn't it seem to you that that very sharp tower could stab God in the feet? Hello gentlemen.. Hello. Pastor, let me introduce you to my colleagues. Voronca, Maliceschi, Buriga Postelnicu, Morariu, My respects, Pastor. Miss. Bertha. Please come inside. Thank you, but... We must... we must... we must lay the foundations of a cultural society And to be able to agree on the project we have to shout one to the other all night long. So we can't... duty first of all. Please. No, no, no... I'll tell you. In fact, the boys want to arrive to the Hora from Stupca. Exactly, Pastor, that's why I would ask you to leave Bertha with us. Yes, yes, and we'll bring her back. We have the cab, we take her with us and we bring her back. It's simple, it's very simple. Pastor. Unfortunately, we are waiting for guests from Cernauti. Today? Yes. And Bertha can't leave her mother alone. I am sorry. My sheep are dear to me, little shepherd. but dearer little girls, shepherd.. Big and strong boy! Guys, I'm going home to get you something ready, and I'll wait for you. Welcome, Mr. Ciprian! Stop the "hora"! Make rows! They catch the lads with the arcane (lasso). They'll take them to the army. In the emperor's army. My soul aches... We guard the foreign gates but it will come a moment when we'll set them on fire!... If I'll live that day, on my honor, I will stop many! Come on, let's go, too! Enough! Go home! Make rows! We must arrive at Suceava until tomorrow morning! That's how they caught me with the arcane. Damned army, it brought me so much bitterness so much bitterness, so much pain, only tears on the floor. The songs of the people... My soldier has been gone for a long time the house remains poor the oxen don't work the land and the parents are sad Yes, yes... all these treasures, the songs, the poems, and the dances of the people, need to be defended. Our student society that we are initiating will have success only if it will preserve all these jewels of our nation. They have held for centuries our struggle for freedom and national independence. The holy faith of Balcescu, of Prince Cuza Another '48 will come, Professor Miculi, you'll see. I feel it. We have lived it once before and we feel it when it comes again. You'll see. Good evening! I love you, I love you, guys! And I wish you would never get tired! With you our youth is reborn! Let's swear that during the hour of liberation we will drink wine with the bucket on this porch! On that day, wherever I am, I will harness 100 gendarmes in a carriage and I will come at once to Stupca! You, Father Iraclie, will take care of the drink! Look, Marioara brought a jug of wine! Taste it and tell us if then you will want this kind or another one! This kind, Ciprian, this one! We have enough! Come on, sit down, boys. Ilinca... The most famous singer. And I wash your clothes in mourning I soak them in heavy tears and dry them with pain..and with my longings.. Our Stupca, professor, became a veritable music academy. You know that all the fiddlers of Bucovina (Now Ukraine) come here as apprentices. Let's wish well to our society! Good luck! Good luck to us!

Long live the Flondor family. Very nice Flondor family. Walnut tart is very good... with walnuts. There are cheese ones too, but walnut ones are the best! Indeed I am a great rich man! Why?

Before we get started, I need to tell you something. What? Berta is here in town. Berta? Where? She came with her mother to some relatives. And why didn't you tell me anything from the first moment, you bastard? You can't see her today, but she will coming to our party and prom tomorrow. I barely convinced her mother, and especially her aunt! God, at least she didn't come with the pastor! At least he's not with his dad! I don't know why, but every time I see him, I become mute! I can't say anything, so tomorrow, boy, tomorrow! Why tomorrow? I beg you, Mr. Voronca! I have to see her tonight! Understand? Tonight! Help me please! Tonight! Now! Do it for me, Voronca! Then I go.. How? Where to go? Stay and write! Write down, bastard! "100 YEARS OF FOREIGN RULE ON OUR COUNTRY" Write! Sleep lightly.. Sleep lightly.. Come on, go to bed, damn it! I dreamed of you all night with my eyes open... my dear.. I dreamed of you, I sang to you and I rocked you, my beautiful Bertha. Please, ladies, have a glass of champagne. Please, ma'am. Thank you. Mrs. Gorgon, it's cold, it's... Ma'am, I'd be happy if you'd give me this dance. Alas, I am a great unlucky man! Please. Thank you. Berta, your uncle is waiting for us downstairs in the carriage. It's early, though. Yes, and we must choose a prom queen. And all the boys thought of Bertha. Young man, you are charming, but our principles of education are strict. Bertha is a good child who knows what is allowed and what is not. Isn't that right, Bertha? Yes, aunt. My respects. Let's go. My respects, Bertha. Kiss.. Voronca! My respects, Colonel. What's going on here? Colonel, they started two hours earlier! They also held a conference! You idiot! Why didn't you control? Ciprian! The colonel is furious, I think he found out about our conference. Ladies and gentlemen, students! The high dignitaries of the municipality invite you to take part in the jubilee of the twinning of Bukovina with the great empire of Austria. At the same time, I have the honor to inform you that we will be honored with the presence of His Imperial Majesty, Franz Joseph himself! Quiet! I know three colors in the world, and I preserve them as a holy treasure. What is this? Get out! They are colors of an old fame, that remind of a brave people. As long as there will be these three colors in the sky and in the world, We will have a glorious name, and a glorious future. And when I'll die, my brothers Then put our beautiful three coloured flag on my grave. I know three colors in the world, and I preserve them as a holy treasure. They are colors of an old fame, that remind of a brave people. Congratulations from the bottom of my heart for your wonderful songs! Thank you for being with us all the time! We, the Russian students have decided not to attend this shameful jubilee. We, the Polish students, have the same belief as the Romanian students. And they can't defeat all of us! The same as the Turks will not be able to defeat the Romanian and Russian armies, neither at Grivita nor at Plevna! Friends, let me tell you that you are some reliable boys! On the day of the jubilee, the city will be deserted. My respects, Colonel! Manifests in Romanian, Russian, Polish and even German appeared in the city. Manifests against the emperor, written by students! How many did you arrest? I went to university but the halls were empty. The students left town. You're a jerk. Yes, sir. Here you go. Arboroasa Society. Look at the telegrams they send to Iasi. "Iasi City Hall, Arboroasa, Romanian Youth Society We join with our whole being to the procession for the glorification of the ruler of Moldova, Grigore Ghica Voda, symbol of our independence committee Ciprian Porumbescu, Voronca, Morariu. " You bring them to me, watched by guards! I'll bring them to you, watched by guards! Safe and sound, you idiot! All of them, especially the President Ciprian Porumbescu! I'll go! Go! You idiot! Berta, little girl... are you crying? No, Mom... I was listening. Exceptional! You've made great progress, dear Ciprian. Very great! And your Cremona violin makes me shudder! At one point I was not able to accompany you! I think you felt it, didn't you? On the contrary, I felt very close to you. Mom, I'm going to Corina's "sezatoare". (Work and fun reunion in the countryside) Dad, I'm going to Corina's. See you! Don't be offended, Ciprian, We are too small to oppose the will of God and the king. I am afraid that your departure from the city these days will arouse anger and persecution. Pastor.. if I had stayed there, today I would have been dead. Ciprian! For a moment I really thought you were going to the reunion. And were you scared? Very scared. "On the hill,in the evening, the bucium sounds mournful The herds are climbing it, the stars are sparkling in their way " Berta... you know I hate this hill. Because it separates us! Nothing will ever separate us! Never anything! Neither the mountains! Nor the sea! Neither the sun, Nor the water! Listen... the "bucium" (long horn) I like it a lot! The new moon has appeared! ("Crai nou") New king! The messenger of love. "Crai nou", welcome! Stay still! I stay, don't you see? In the name of Emperor Franz Joseph, you are under arrest! Thief? Pickpocket... Stagecoach? In the forest? ..women! So, murderer! With the ax or the knife? Spotted honor..Crime of honor. The woman must not be killed! She must be beaten! With a piece of wood! Thick! When needed with a wet rope! You understood? Wait a minute. It's all right even this! Take a seat. Welcome! I didn't kill. I steal a lot! There are some who steal. Hello. Look at this. Can you speak? Tell me, was she an officer's wife? Tell me, why did they arrest you? Because I sang. In the church? No. On the streets. Oh, my..this is very serious! You smoke too. Ciprian Porumbescu! Only two people! Let the girls in first. Nothing will ever separate the two of us! Never anything! Neither the wind nor the sea Neither the sun nor the mountains "On the hill,in the evening, the bucium sounds mournful The herds are climbing it, the stars are sparkling in their way " The last minute! Ciprian, the jubilee wasn't celebrated! The emperor was afraid! The boys kiss you too! The trial date has not yet been set! Ciprian, don't worry, we'll all be in the hall! No classes have been held in the last week! Good thoughts.. All the teachers are with you. We will all be in the hall. Ready! The speaker is finished! Ready! Dear child. Come faster, faster! Ready, gentlemen! The gates are closing! Ready gentlemen, come on, come on! Faster! Father, you have lost your psalm book! I kiss your hands. It's a song written by Mr. Ciprian. Please give it to the students. That's it, gentlemen! The gates are closing! Ready! On our flag... It's written "Union" In all my songs I sang the mourning and joy of our people its love for the land and for the freedom. I sang this holy earth that blooms only for our heart and soul and if we knew it was lost forever we would push him with our hands into the sea, we would sink it! But no one will succeed in destroying our national being! No one! Never! Quiet! We're evacuating the room! On our flag is written Union, Union in thought and in feelings And under its great shadow we will face any stroke He who is afraid in a hard fight, is himself a wanderer And we, united always, have been, we will be victorious! Gentlemen, there is no time to debate. Stop it, gentlemen, we're evacuating the hall! We armed our hand to guard a precious land Justice is its master, and lord is the holy truth And in the book of eternity it is written that countries and nations will perish, But our beautiful and eternal Romania, will flourish. (Original lyrics) Colonel, what shall we do, Colonel? We don't have enough time. There's no time for debate. Liquidate this whole story as soon as possible, and without fuss! Destroy Arboroasa and send him to prison! Can't you see what's going on? Enough! Enough! Scatter them! (Romanian traditional song for the new year) E badita Vindireu! Welcome, welcome and Marry Christmas! I like you to sing on my doorstep... Young mister Ciprian... dear child... We have come to wish you for the beginning of the year. "Lerui ler" On the sky of your life, have no trouble White flowers would fill your house and selected dishes would fill your table "BALADA" Blood? Help! Help! Help! Killers! Killers! Berta! Ciprian! Berta! Ciprian! Every night I dreamed that the guards beat you and I waked up scared. Did they beat you? They beat you, I see. I hate them. You lost weight. You have lost a lot of weight, my dear! It smells like apple and it's nice. It's as if the earth has risen in the air. They are the flowers of the field. Bertha.. Do you know who you are? Who? You are the queen of the flowers! Kneel down to crown you! For the the queen of the flowers, a crown of wildflowers with "forget-me-not" gems. The high priest asks you to swear. I swear. "I swear I will love my most worthy subject forever." I swear from the bottom of my heart! "I swear I'm getting engaged to her here, before God" I swear! "I swear I will always stand by him in faith" "I swear I will never leave him." I swear. I pledge to rise against him if he dares from now on to leave me for a moment! Never! Not even for a moment! Bertha, I won't go anywhere! I decided. I remain a teacher in your village, in Ilisesti. Bertha! My mother! Bertha! All the best, Mister Ciprian! Ciprian! Come on, run! Come on, run! You'll leave to Vienna! That's why Mr. Miculi, Mancevski, Voronca came to us! What are you doing, are you wondering on the hills? At school, bro. The boys sent me here with money to send you to Vienna. Come on. Thank you, but... What? Hey! Look at him... at school, bro! Glad you came. Reliable friends. After so much mourning God has opened His eyes to us again. Come on, come on, come on, Daddy's boy! Hello, Professor. Dear Ciprian, we're here to convince you to go to Vienna. You have to go to Vienna to complete your studies. At our university, as you know, unfortunately you can't go back. but you must fulfill your knowledge and talent. People with your endowment are born once a century and it's a shame to let themselves crushed. You owe it to our entire nation. It will be difficult, money is scarce. But my duty as a parent is to do everything. My brother Eusebius wrote to me that he is waiting for you in Vienna. You can see him. You can even stay with him. Thank you, Mr. Mancevski. Vienna is the cradle of musical culture throughout Europe. The most enlightened minds of our country were formed in Vienna. There also you will meet, maybe, the best of the Romanian youth. And the best composition teachers. You must go, Ciprian. You must! Here you managed to be known only by your people, there you could be known even by the king! Do you understand, boy? Great idea! I have many friends and colleagues in Vienna! Let me give you a few lines of recommendation to my colleagues Their addresses must be somewhere around here. Bertha! Bertha! Come and get this braid out of here. It's dry. He brought it here and she still behaves like a child. No... I climbed, too, a rock today, to get a flower. Berta, Mr. Ciprian is living a great moment today. Congratulations. He'll go to Vienna to continue his studies. Yes, yes, excellent. Your future is there, in the city of music! Pastor! The big hive has come and escaped, please help me, Pastor! That's a good sign. I think it escaped! Okay, Hans, why weren't you careful? Such a fruitful hive? I got it from my father! The queen of the flowers... her crown withered... its gems fell! No, I didn't hide anything from you. I didn't know anything on the hill. I have to go. I will learn and return here. I swear on my knees, Berta. After Vienna, your father will look at me differently. No! No! No! Forgive me... I know you have to go. Please study calmly. I will wait for you. I will wait for you even if I should wait for you all my life. Mother! Where are my gloves and... mask? But what, are you going to Vienna too? I no longer understand anything. Does anyone help me? Do I have to do everything by myself in this house? Ciprian Porumbescu and the poet Andrei Barseanu. The morning stars of "Romania juna" ("Young Romania) from Vienna. Ciprian Porumbescu is the martyr of the "Arboroasa" society. "Apostle" of the nation.. Mrs. Teresa Kanitz, prom princess. A role for which she would do everything. You're mean, Andrei! Mrs. Kanitz is the protector of "Romania juna" It's true, but first of all her mission on the earth is to smile to shine and to collect compliments. And who is the gentleman? Mr. Honoriu Simulescu. A bastard. He considers himself the soul ("the hand") of "Romania Juna" a hand with six fingers. With five, he grabs and with the sixth he lets something falling down... seldom. And that, very little (only from "under his nails"). Officially is the representative of the Ministry of Public Instruction from Bucharest Be careful with him because he shares the scholarships granted by the Royal house from Bucharest. What do you think, Andrei, will they support me for publishing my collection of social songs for students? All that matters is not loosing Mrs. Kanitz's favors. Andrei, this man looks at me sideways every time he meets me. Imperial Commissioner. He is always looking for victims and plots. And now, ladies and gentlemen, we will sing "The camellia waltz" written by Ciprian Porumbescu in honor of the ball princess, Mrs. Teresa Kanitz. I'm flattered, Mr. Porumbescu! Ma'am, please grant me this dance. With pleasure! Camellia? As you can see, "Camellia" Mr. Porumbescu, let me introduce you to one of the waltz kings, Master Eduard Strauss! We've already known each other for a few weeks! Oh, master! I believed that only in my salons the celebrities can meet! Come on! Dear Honoriu, let me introduce you to the virtuous young man about whom I spoke to you with such passion! Honoriu Simulescu. I have the honor, sir. Here you go. Come on! You will find that Mr. Simulescu is the most distinguished person in "Romania Juna". And what are you studying, Mr. Porumbescu? The Conservatory, of course. No, only philosophy for now. At the conservatory I listen extraordinarily to the classes of master Anton Bruckner Yes, yes. Let Andrei Barsean not hear! Champagne for everyone! I consider you the greatest Romanian talent, after Mihail Eminescu who has come to study in Vienna so far. Dear Honoriu, I am sure that he will give back to Romania Juna the old shine. Ciprian, Camelia, in whose heart I thought I had a place, is ready to swear that you thought of her when you wrote the waltz that was sung now. Please forgive me, ma'am! Andrei is kidding! Mr. Porumbescu, I watched the "Arboroasa" process with great interest. I admired your courage. You are a symbol for all of us! Ciprian, I told you, you are the man Romania Juna needed. It would be sad, very sad, miss, to take Romania Juna on the sad road of Arboroasa. And this right now, when the diplomatic agency in the capital of the empire it was raised to the rank of legation. The first Romanian legation in the world! Mr. Porumbescu must prove a lot of wisdom. Tact and wisdom. This is the only way to get the scholarship you applied for from our ministry. I will do my best not to disappoint you. Ciprian, let me introduce you to the minister's nephew! Monicescu. I am deeply convinced that the mister is first and foremost a value in itself. We will be happy to have him among us at music or literary evenings. Isn't that right, Andrei? Of course, but mister should declare his vocation! And now, ladies and gentlemen "Wine, woman and song" "Wine, woman and song" says Johann Strauss It's a vocation, isn't it, gentlemen? Miss.. It's not possible, it's after a century of suffering! "Because the hour (clock) is new and big", fortissimo! What hour? May I know exactly? It's the cathedral clock, it's the firemen's clock? It's Grandma's watch? Yes, Commissioner, these are the lyrics of our poet, Vasile Alecsandri. You can discuss music with Mr Ciprian Porumbescu, if you wish, Commissioner. Here it is clearly written: "After a century of suffering", music and lyrics by Ciprian Porumbescu" "The Martyr of Arboroasa" is a multilateral talent. The stinging pages of "Piparusa" magazine were signed by "Mephistopheles". You too, Mr. Ciprian Porumbescu, right? I never hid that. Mr. Simulescu, I have the impression that things are very serious. We need to talk. When you want, Commissioner. We can't afford to mess around here in the capital of the empire! Guys, I'm done for tonight. See you tomorrow. "I want to know what hour?" The decisive hour, you asshole! The one I was wearing at the jacket, I took it to the pawn shop a week ago! Ciprian, I'm going to meet a friend from Brasov Professor Nastase, I really want you to meet him. Mrs.. I have the honor. Goodbye, mr.Monicescu. Mr. Simulescu.. Excuse me.. Do you have any answers about my scholarship? It's getting harder and harder for me. Otherwise I would not dare. Teresa, didn't you let him know? Mr. Porumbescu, unfortunately, you arrived in Vienna too late. That scholarship had long been awarded to Mr. Pompiliu Monicescu, who is an eminent student. In fact, you come from the truncated part of Romania and you should struggle to get a scholarship from the Austrian Empire! Ciprian! Good evening. Guys, we're saved. We have a party. Take your violin and come with us, please! Come on, musician, come with us and have some fun, okay? Thanks, I can't. I'll pay. I'm bringing in 30 beautiful women. You'll mention me. Come on. Thanks, but I'm not feeling well. Your business. Mon cher, there are plenty fiddlers in our Vienna! Mr. Ciprian is a great composer! Forgive me, Ciprian, Monicescu gathers them from everywhere! "In Paris, in the brothels of cynicism and laziness With "lost" women in obscene orgies, and playing cards There you consumed your fortune, and your youth... What did the West bring out of you, when there is nothing remained? " Ciprian, my friend professor Nastase from Brasov And Miss Camelia, a student of natural sciences The most beautiful Romanian plant in Vienna! Andrei, I'll return home. It is not possible anymore. I have no choice. I return to my village as a teacher. I learned something from Master Bruckner. I will continue to study on my own. You will be a teacher in Brasov. Nowhere else. Brasov is the center of Romanian spirituality throughout Transylvania. From Vienna, you can go only in Brasov. Accept it, Ciprian. That's the best thing you can do. In a few months I will finish college and we will be together again. Do you hear, Ciprian? Vienna sings you, Ciprian! In our country everyone cries when they sing your songs! Bertha! Bertha! Ciprian! You came! I came to take you with me forever! I didn't dare tell you until now. I waited to have a job. Now I am a teacher and conductor in Brasov and I have concerts... And I can...I hope I can provide Berta with a happy home. Dear Ciprian.. Your proposal finds me completely unprepared. I have nothing against you... Let's wait a while... then... you know too well Our faith is not the same... You Orthodox, we Anglicans Please. Be patient. Let's think about it some more. Marioara, what else do you know about Voronca? He hasn't written to me in a long time. Voronca, he's finishing this year, too and I think he'll come to Stupca. My good sister! Do you know that I received the booklet for "Crai nou" from Mircesti, from Vasile Alecsandri? Yes? The great Vasile Alecsandri and the young Ciprian Porumbescu in the first Romanian operetta! That's it, I'm done. You have to go to bed, it's late. I will get up early tomorrow morning, I must not be late for school. Yes. Good. There are peoples who, safe from the onslaught and devastating oppression lasted their fortresses and palaces, immortalizing their genius in marble and stone. Our people, my dear ones, have kept their genius for centuries in their songs and dances This living treasure, you must to carry on. Our songs carry with them... listen! They carry with them the grief and joy of our people. Its love of land and freedom. We Romanians we have songs like no other in this world. Forgive me, but it rang a long time ago! Ciprian.. Guys, you're free, thank you. I have a surprise for you. "Crai nou" was approved. No, Andrei Barseanu has come! Ciprian! Andrei! Andrei, I'm not at all sorry that I came to Brasov. I worked here like I've never worked before. Now we are all struggling to present the operetta. I found out everything, that's why I came. Didn't you find out even if Mr. Moisoiu from "Gazeta Transilvaniei" who promised us that today at 9.30 will bring us the answer, will come with the approval? I'm here, on time, as always, Professor! I have the honor, gentlemen! Mr. Porumbescu, I'm coming from the town hall right now. And? Everyone agrees. There are only two small details. First of all, the operetta cannot be presented in Romanian. What language do you prefer? Ancient Greek, Latin or Turkish? Romanian. All the actors of the band speak perfect Romanian! Second, the actors can't enter the stage with the peasant shoes (opinci). You know, that alters not only the style of the theater, but especially the taste of the audience. Remove the peasant shoes! Take them out of the streets first, because they're pretty ugly there, too. Only with these conditions, gentlemen, the mayor's office will sign the approval! And that's in three or four months because the hall was ceded to a band from Vienna which will present the latest news from the capital of the Empire. We remain deeply grateful, Mr. Moisoiu, but we don't have any reason for it! Give up your peasants if you really want to be... Mr. Moisoiu, see if that door closes on the outside. Try it, sir! I propose to present the operetta by own means! Leheriu and Nastase and I will play a role And we and our wives will interpret a role! The Romanian school orchestra is at your disposal. We will come with the orchestra of the Saxon chapel from the city! We will present the operetta here, in our home! Marioara! Marioara! Put all the best we have on the table! In two weeks will be the premiere of the operetta "Crai nou" Hooray! The first Romanian operetta in the most beautiful hall of Brasov! No, in the festivities hall of the Romanian schools! The Honorable City Hall has created all the conditions so that we cannot play it! Instead, the whole city is with us. The Saxon chapel in the city gives us all the help. Marioara, I have to work day and night. You run to Stupca and call Berta and Pastor Gorgon, and my father, everyone! and I will write to Voronca. On the evening of the premiere, I will get engaged to Berta. Finally! Dad, Dad, please talk to him nicely. It's relentless. Father Iraclie, please, please! Okay, Daddy's girl. Good. Father! Dad, tell him that Ciprian waits for us all at the premiere! Ask him gently! I'll do it, I'll do it, don't worry. Speak nicely, he doesn't want it at all! Only God deserves to be loved with such faith! Thank you. For what are we without God? A leaf on the water! Ciprian can make her happy! No. Ascend to God with all your heart if you want to be happy! For He is the law and the truth, and he cannot accept the wandering(another religion)! No, pastor! The only thing in the world that God does not dare to judge is love! God judges everything! He is omnipotent! And in front of him... I know, I know, pastor! In front of Him we have to stay on our knees and bow our heads. "Command, O Lord, and I will go by myself to the mountain of the cross." Yes, Father Iraclie. Faith means obedience. No, Pastor. Faith means understanding. My respects, ma'am. We came to talk rationally, pastor. I cannot be equal to God. You hide behind words, Pastor Gorgon. You take the sword against two loving hearts and you think you are under the shield of God God Himself is against this love! No, pastor. God cannot be the enemy of love. When you say that, you feel bigger than God. No! I am God's servant! The humblest! Pastor Gorgon... Our children love each other. It's the cleanest thing in the world. Allow this mystery of mysteries. Open your heart for them! Be wise, don't make them sigh! It's the flower of love, Pastor. It would be a shame to crush it! Father Iraclie.. I thought about it for a long time. I can't let Berta marry Ciprian. Thinking about Ciprian's health, I realize it will be a severe blow to him. but I cannot, I have no right to break the laws of my faith. God forgive you, executioner wrapped in a holy cloak! God, if you exist, cover your face, so you don't be ashamed! Dad, help me! God, protect me! I love him! My love for him is as holy as the faith in you! God help me, God! Help me, God, I love him! You will have to forget him. No! You will go to England, to our relatives. And you will forget him. No! On the way we will make a stop in Brasov to see him again. Crai nou (New king) You are welcome to us! Crai nou.. The herald of love. Crai nou, welcome! Bravo, Ciprian! Dad... Now I can go. I saw him. Please. Well done, Ciprian! Ciprian, this is the first great victory of the Romanian song! Bravo, bravo, I was the first to say that it will be very successful! I claimed that the author of the operetta studied with great diligence the works of the great composers Offenbach... Thank you, Mr. Moisoiu, but this is not about any composer I have studied and I study it with great diligence. This is our people. Absolutely beautiful! And that's just because of you guys! Ciprian, our Arboasa is not dead. I knew you were going have success. Ciprian, you promised that after the premiere you would go to rest, to take care of your health. I will rest preparing a great Romanian concert to conquer the world. Aha! Guys, the light is on. Bertha has come! Did you come, my dears...? Have you been to the hall, have you seen what a success? Bertha, where's Bertha? Bertha? Bertha? My respects, pastor. Thank you for coming. But where is Bertha? Dear Ciprian, Bertha has gone to England forever. Everything was written to happen like this. We must obey God's will. We would have gladly received you as a son, but we are separated by a cliff over which no bridges can be thrown. Think of us without hatred. You have to forget it. Throw yourself into the arms of your second girlfriend. Look for your comfort in music. Ciprian, there are the singers from the Hungarian chapel of the town. Call them here, Marioara... Andrei! Nastase! What does your God say, Pastor? The winter is rough in our zone, Professor. You really must go to Italy. I talked to the principal and I got your three-month salary. Don't worry, we will replace you, both at school and in the choirs. I have here...Here is a request to be excused for two months with the promise that on my return I would fill all the gaps caused by my absence. No. Absolute rest. You are not allowed to make the effort to play the violin either. Please leave the violin here. "Yesterday I visited the great Verdi at his villa near Genoa. On the way back it started to rain heavily. The sea was very rough. Cold and humid wind. The doctor visited me twice today. I feel very weak. I cough harder and harder. I miss my homeland. Please send me, please, my dear violin. I remain indebted to you. Ciprian Porumbescu. Nervi. February 1883. " Hello, Grand Signor, what did you play? A "Nocturne". .. Bertha? Here you are. They are lemon flowers. How old are you, Cici? Five. What about you? Twenty-nine. We'll break up soon, little Cici. Why? I'm going home. Why? The doctors told me I couldn't hope for anything here. Why? I came too late. Why? I can't wait to see our lands. To hear the "doina". Have you ever listened to a doina? Not. I'll sing it to you one day Mr. Porumbescu, your violin has arrived. My violin, where is it? Where is it? Who plays, General? A romanian. And what does he play? Doina! You, the Mediterranean, the cradle of so many treasures of Rome and ancient Greece, carry on your waves my dear doina and let your waters carry it to the ocean and the ocean tell the whole world which song is the most precious to the Romanian. June 6, 1883 Goodbye, Bertha ("BALLAD") Sleep gently, sleep gently...
