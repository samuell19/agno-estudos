(thrilling music) (water splashes) (suspenseful music) - [Molly] I was born Jack. Jack is who I am. For a time there, I wasn't thinking clearly. I was confused, in limbo. I mean, this is 1888, isn't it? I knew it was Jack. Plain Jack. Quiet Jack. Jack's my name. Jack who's soul never sleeps. Not the good shepherd. Not the prince of peace. I am him and he is me. I'm red Jack, spring-heeled Jack, saucy Jack. Jack from Hell. Trade name, Jack the Ripper. ♪ Hallelujah ♪ (crow cawing) ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ (suspenseful music) (thudding) - Molly, things are kinda piling up this morning. - [Molly] It's this place. It's happening again. - So what is it today, Molly? - I can't stay here anymore. - I know it's frustrating, but we're doing everything we can. So how's that new drug working out? - [Molly] Drugs won't help me. (banging) - What the heck is going on out there? - Fine if it was real. (sighs) - This is a perfect example of behavior non-conducive to-- (dramatic music) (growls) (crunching) - No more lies. (lips smacking) See you in Hell, mother fucker! - We tried everything, Molly. Shock therapy has had no positive effect. Nor has medication. And I gotta be honest, I'm out of options. - [Molly] So what am I doing here? - Another avenue has come to my attention. It's a pilot experiment developed to increase synaptic integration. It's a medical term used to describe a state of mind where reality is suspended and it becomes just a fantasy. But, you see, the mind believes it's real. The person feels it's real, but it's not real. It'd be all in your head, Molly. All in your head. The doctor who's pioneering it has expressed an interest in your case history. He wants you for a clinical trial in Europe. Now, they've sent a representative to meet you. Say hello to Dr. Marya Hauser. - Hello, Molly. Here on behalf of the Weisser Institute outside of Prague. There's something I want you to understand. There's a reason these guys are setup overseas. Their methods may be radical, procedures that would never be approved in this country. But if you want to go, I'll sign you out. - I'll meet you to read those papers carefully before you decide. - Give me pen. (suspenseful music) - That's that, then. (woman screaming) - [Woman] Please, stop! Who are you? (suspenseful music) (storm raging) (woman screaming) (banging) (woman whispering) (woman screaming) (birds chirping) - Welcome, Molly Keller. (gate creaking) I want the program started immediately post-op. (monitors beeping) Scalpel. I want this one to go perfectly. Cranial saw. (saw buzzing) (rattling) (dripping softly) Probe. Perfect. Look at that response. (monitors beeping) Incredible. (whooshing) (whooshing) (whooshing) (whooshing) (whooshing) (crackling) (whooshing) I've never seen such activity. (whooshing) (crackling) (eerie music) - Her string is denser than the others. (beeping) - Yes, strange. (chains rattling) (ax clatters) (beeping) (chains rattling) (crackling) (sparks crackling) (thrilling music) (groaning softly) (screaming) (rattling) (coughing) (chains rattling) - [Molly Voiceover] What is this place? Where the hell am I? (horse hooves pattering) 1888? No, not again. Hello. - Welcome to your subconscious, Molly. - What is this place? - I allow new patients' minds to wander as they please on their first session. It can reveal much about their core psychosis. And judging by yours, we have much work ahead. - Who the hell are you? - My name is Dr. Samuel Weisser. And you are in an inherited memory. - This can't be real. - It's not. Look behind you. (electricity crackling) (monitor beeping) This is how you and I look in the real world. (chains rattling) You've heard of people speaking in tongues, of children suddenly talking in foreign languages? People who think they're communicating with the dead? The truth is, we retain life experience in our genetic material and can pass it down. To most, this retention is very fragmentary, but to some, like you, it is remarkably intact. (screaming) (jar breaking) You can calm down. It's just a simulation. (ax cracking) - This is sick! (groans) - Molly! (thrilling music) - [Molly] It's him! Run, he's coming! (groans) (suspenseful music) (blade clatters) - Where do you think you're going? (screaming) (gasps) (screaming) - Marya! All right, Molly. You're unharmed. Let's get her to the ward. (suspenseful music) - Can we talk? - She's our best subject yet. So responsive. - Maybe too responsive. Her readings are off the chart compared to the others. Perhaps we should taper her dosage. - Nonsense. She's simply more willing than the others. That's no reason to alter the program. We continue as planned. - Welcome back, Molly. You've been out for a while, but now the emotion process is complete. - How long have I been here? - About a day and a half. - It feels like weeks. - Time is elastic in the dream state. - You're telling me that all of that was a dream? - Only a dream! I know this must be difficult for you, Molly. - Is it all gonna be as difficult? - Preferably. In trauma, powerful neurochemical processes occur, which can effectively rewire the brain. By introducing a simulated trauma within a virtual environment, we can control it's effects and help the brain to heal itself. The good news is that the results of your first simulation are outstanding! Come, it's time you saw the facility. This castle was built in the 13th century to repel the invading German and Mongol hordes. I built the clinic here with the same idea, only today the hordes are media and government agencies. (mysterious music) There are those who would ridicule what we do here, but we can't expect the blind to possess foresight, can we? I believe one day history will look on you and I as pioneers, Molly. The test case that led us out of a dark age of fear, paranoia, and war. We can use this virtual technology to cure any phobia or predilection. The key is neuromodification through virtual learning. - Isn't it possible for a mind to lose touch with reality? To get lost in the dreamworld? - Possibly. - But then we always have our fail safe. - What's that? - We wake you up. Ah, come and meet one of your fellow pioneers! (electric guitar music) This is Erich. - What's his problem? - It depends on the day. I will tell you, his parole officer wasn't grief-stricken to see him go. I'll show you the rest of the clinic, and then we should just make dinner. Hello, everybody. I'd like you to meet Molly. Molly, these are your fellow pioneers. The other trial subjects. - Hi, Molly. I'm Juliette. - And this is Sally. And Roberto. - What's up? - And, lastly, Grant. And Lara. - [Grant] Fresh meat. - Ignore him, Molly. He's the only one here who's beyond help. - Be nice! She's just come off rather a bumpy ride. - You're Molly Keller, aren't you? - Every time I look in the mirror. - Is is true then what they say? - Shut up, Grant. - What? - What is it they say? - That you and dead people have a nasty habit of showing up at the same time. Good news is, you won't be alone. I bet Mr. South Central over here has popped a few brothers, right, Roberto? (lips popping) (dishes crashing) (grunting) (dramatic music) - You point those fingers at me again, I keep 'em. (chuckling) - I told you so. - Is he really worth an Eastern Bloc jail cell? - [Roberto] You're a lucky man, this time. - In case you're wondering, Grant's a sexual deviant. Not much of one at that. - Sal, tell me what I have to do to put a smile on your face. I'll do anything. - You can't spare that many fingers. - Give it a rest! We're all outcasts here. Lara's a pyromaniac. Juliette has masochistic tendencies. And Sally, as far as I can tell, anger management issues. You've heard about mental already. We've been recruited from jails, institutions, the streets, why? - Ah, cue conspiracy theory. - Because no one on the outside gives a damn about us in here. Think about it. - What are you saying? - I'm saying that I'll be watching my back and you lot should be watching yours. (beeping) - Yes. Looks good. As I expected. Adjust the alpha wave. All vital signs are good. Give me a cross section view. Better. Okay. Let's do this. (beeping) - No, I think Erich's right. I'm gonna watch my back. I think there's a lot more to Molly than she or they are letting on. - Well, considering what she's been through in her life, she seems pretty together. Maybe the treatment's working. Shame it's not working for you though. - Hey. Sal, I am not feeling the love here. I am not feeling the love. - And you're not going to either so forget it. Maybe Molly's available. We all know what happens to her mates. - Hey, hey, don't even joke about that. You know, I'm a nice fella. Are you sure you don't want a bit of company? - Unless you want to see a serious lack of anger management, I'd suggest you piss off! - I get the message. Plenty more fish in the sea. (suspenseful music) Ah, don't leave, don't leave! What are you doing? Oh yeah, take it off. Take it off. (chuckles) Oh, that's my girl, that's my girl. Oh, yes. Ooh! (gasps) I was just passing by! - [Sally] You wanker! Get a good look, did you? - Yeah, I did actually, yeah. (shouts) - You'll be on therapy! Just get out of my room and go and perv somewhere else! - I'm going. (thunder cracking) - [Erich] Look, all I'm saying is that this treatment is pretty out there. He's screwing with our minds. - [Molly] Yeah, so? - [Roberto] Nobody messes with me. - Warned you. - Grant, you're such a cock! (dramatic music) (screams) (thunder cracking) (eerie growling) (whimpering) (light crackles) (whimpering) (shouts) (body thuds) (shouts) (screams) (whimpering) (door thudding) (light crackling) (groans nervously) (banging) (eerie growling) (sword slamming) (screaming) (screaming) (thunder cracking) (thunder cracking) (thrilling music) (whimpering) Mama, help me! (thrilling music) (screaming) - Come on! (screaming) Hold on, I'm coming! Grab my hands! (groaning) (whimpering) Hang on, Sally, don't let go! Erich, help! Hold on, Sally, come on! (Sally screams) No, Sally, no! (screaming) (pipe creaking) (groaning) (gate cracks) Sally! (screaming) (monitor droning) (grunting softly) - Close that curtain! (air whooshing) (gasps) You're back, good. - Oh my God, Sally. - You see? Grief, remorse, guilt. Welcome to the human race, Molly. - She died because of me. I tried. I tried to stop it! - It's all right. What you and Sally experienced was all part of the treatment. - What? - That's right. Unfortunately, Sally isn't feeling that well. An adverse reaction to the medication. (dramatic music) - What the hell are you saying? I saw her die! - I tell you, she's fine. - Where is she? - On her way back to England. She won't be able to complete the program. - Lies! - You cut yourself before you fell, didn't you? You see. This is not yet an exact science. We've had a glitch, but we've sorted the problem out. Now, all you need is some food and a well-deserved rest. (monitor beeping) - Molly seems to have accepted your explanation. Now try me. - I am trying to determine what went wrong! - Erich was supposed to help Molly, Sally was to live. What the hell happened? - It must be some variable that we didn't account for. - We have to stop the program right now! - Impossible. That's months of preparation wasted! It would mean starting from zero! - I can't be a party to this. - Marya, you knew there was an element of risk involved. Don't forget, we developed and initiated this system together. Let's get to work, shall we? (suspenseful music) (thunder cracking) - Grab my hand! Hang on, Sally, don't let go! (screaming) No, no! (screaming) (groaning) (groaning) No, Sally! (eerie growling) (suspenseful music) - [Marya] Look at this! - [Weisser] Some kind of interference. Where is it coming from? As you know, we've been having some minor problems with our software. (fingers snapping) So. While my staff perform a systems check, I thought I would take the opportunity to show you the historic city of Prague. - You all right? A bit out of it, are we? Come on. We'll show you around. - Didn't you see that? - Who is it? - I must be losing it. - Come on, it's all right. - The city was founded in the ninth century. It became the seat of the kings of Bohemia and later a center for the Holy Roman Empire. Through the years, these streets have seen rivers of blood. From a window, just over there in 1419, seven members of the reigning town council were thrown to their deaths. Onto waiting enemy pikes below. This way. - Hey. Where the hell did Dr. Evil come from? - I know, but I kinda like it. (upbeat rock music) - You'll find this interesting. This is one of the finest collections of medieval torture devices in Eastern Europe. (people whispering) As you can see, the designers of yesteryear were both inventive and not without a fine sense of the macabre. - I'm outta here. There's much better sights to see in this town. (tongue clicking) (thrilling music) (heels clacking) (dramatic music) Hey ladies, do you speak my language? (sword clatters) Where's the party? (dramatic music) Come on, I won't bite. (girls chuckle) (sword clatters) - Come on, let's go. What is it? - None of this seems real to me. - It's just your imagination. (light crackles) - I told you something strange was going on. - Relax, it's nothing. - Molly. (Molly gasps) I have dismissed the others. We will regroup back here at 10 o'clock. Enjoy your evening. (light crackles) - Right. (loud dance music) Yeah! (laughs) (chuckles) Hey, babes, I gotta go check out the potties downstairs. - Something's wrong. - About this morning? - No, no, nothing like that. Remember how you warned us about what they might be doing to us in this treatment? - Mm-hmm. - You don't seem worried anymore. Why? I'm not sure what is real and what isn't. - You're real to me and that's all that counts. Let's go see the town. Come on.

There's no Prague. - What? - We're not here. - What the fuck are you saying? (whooshing) - What's happening? How did we get here? - We never left. - Never left the castle? - Never left the virtual world. We're in it right now. - So all of this is some kind of fantasy? - I wish it was. - Man, you are making no sense. - Where's Grant then? If this isn't real then he isn't dead. - Weisser lied to us all. I woke from immersion for a brief moment and I saw Sally's body after she fell. I'm sure she was dead. I think Grant must be too. - If this isn't real, our bodies must be alive somewhere. - I think that anyone who dies here is dying in reality. Our real bodies are sedated in his lab, but somehow our minds are killing us when we die here. (electricity crackling) (door creaking) - Doctor, it's not true what she's saying, is it? - That they are dead? Oh yes, they most certainly are. - There's something wrong with the program isn't there because I keep seeing faults, flaws like drain pipes that vanish and people that shouldn't be here. - Wrong. No. Different, yes. Evolving. Yes. - Just wake us up! Let us out of this until you have it fixed. - I don't think so. - What do you mean? - You brought us here. You still control this program. - Very much so. - Doctor, please! - Stay back. - What? (thunder cracking) - I know you. - Yes. - Man, I don't give a fuck who knows who. You're gonna let us the fuck outta here right now! - Hey! (gasps) - Erich! - Erich! - What the fuck? (sword whooshing) - [Lara] What's happening? (smoke whooshing) (people shouting) (women screaming) - Nothing. The control interface is dead. What happened? - It's as if the shutdown was performed from within the program. Look at this! This is showing a new sentient in the simulation. Someone or something is in their with them. - Impossible. (beeping) - We have to power down, get them out. - We can't rephase without access. They would come out brain dead. - What the hell is that? - He seemed real familiar with you, Molly. - Where could he have come from? - Me. I think it's coming from me. - Run that again. - Look, I can't explain it, but whatever he or it is, it's coming from me. - I heard stories about you, the killings. They're all true, aren't they? - What really happened to Sally last night? - You're telling me that thing that just whooped our asses without even trying is coming from you? Well, then there's a real easy solution to this thing. We waste you, he's gone. - Wait, I saw what happened last night. She can't be projecting this thing. (groans) - It ain't nothing personal, Molly, but it's you or us. - Go ahead. - You can't do it, Roberto. See, the treatment's working. - Fuck you, man! I ain't helpless. - Where are you going? - I'm getting out of here and away from here. - Look, I think that we should stay together! - Roberto, if this world isn't real there's no where to run to. - Yeah? Yeah, well, it's real enough to die in. And if this bad shit is coming from her head, the more distance I put between her and me the better I'm gonna feel! - Anyone got a better idea? I didn't think so. - So, what now? - Either of you any good with computers? - I was good in school, why? - Well, if this is a replica of the real clinic then Weisser's computer should be here. I reckon we try and figure a way out. (dramatic music) (eerie growling) (panting) - Yeah! Bingo! (engine sputtering) What now? - What's going on? What's that? (grunts) - What are we looking for? - There must be some way that we can change the simulated environments from here. The way that Weisser did after I fell. - Because you didn't die, of course. Weisser must have seen Sally fall and reacted to save you by changing the environments. - [Roberto] Shit! - I can't find any wire by. - Man, this car's been messed with. Hand me that Phillips again, huh? - Which one's the Phillips? - Forget it, damn! - I mean, can't you hurry up, I'm freezing? - Well, what the hell do you think I'm doing, huh? Spanking my monkey wrench? Will you please take your ass back inside and find me a flashlight or this will take all night! (groans) Damn. (suspenseful music) (beeping) - Why are you fighting this, Molly? I'm beginning to fear these companions of yours are gaining too much of your favor. There should be no one standing between us. - No! - No, what? (sighs) (beeping) - We're through into the program interface. (thunder cracking) - Find me a flashlight? (eerie growling) Look forget it, just give me that slot again, huh? Come on, man, you wanna be stuck her all night! (dramatic music) (screaming) Lara! Lara! (thrilling music) (car creaking) What the fuck you doing? No. No! Who are you? (car creaking) Fuck! Lara! No! No, no, no! (panting) Oh God. Jesus. My sweet Lord Jesus. No! (groans) (thrilling music) Go, go! - No escape! - Where is he? - This way! (groaning) - Help! (shouting) (shouting) (feet pattering) - It worked. I do hate that sort of environment. Why did you go, love? We could have done-- - This is my problem. He's after me. - Look, man, you, uh. You saved my ass back there, I owe you. - You just did the same for me. - Yeah, right, I did. (lights crackling) (electricity crackling) (sparks blasting) Fuck, what now? - It likes the dark. It's always liked the dark. - The computers. We won't be able to use them without any power. - This place has got virtual fucking toilets. It's gotta have a virtual fucking generator! - Right, let's find it. - What about you? - I'm gonna go find the others, okay? I've got to find the others. - [Lara] That ass Roberto left me alone in that place! - [Juliette] We're not gonna get out of here without a light. - Let's just stay in the lab. - Here. Wait here. - Hurry! (suspenseful music) - Come on. Damn, it's not working! - It has to work, why won't it work? - I saw another one upstairs. - Oh no, what's that? - What? What? You stay here. - No, no, don't go, don't leave me. - We need a light that works, I'll be back. (whimpering) (thunder cracking) (electricity crackling) Come on. Come on. (sword clattering) (gasps) (screams) (slashing) No! (whimpering) (screaming) (thrilling music) (rats squeaking) - Oh, no. Come on. No. Light. Oh, God. (thrilling music) Juliette? Molly? Where is everybody? Oh, come on. Come on. No, no. Please. Oh. Come on. (dramatic music) (screaming) (splashing) (sword slashing) (screaming) (splashing) (rattling) (eerie growling) (crying) - No! (sword whooshing) (laughing eerily) - Oh God! Lara! (dramatic music) Oh God, Lara! (screaming) No, no! No, no! - Molly, wake up! Wake up! - No! - You're here with us in the ward! It's over, Molly. You're safe, it's over. It was just a simulation. The entire thing, everything you've experienced. - Lara! - We will talk about it all, Molly. I promise you. Now, we just need to remove your umbilical. - Stay away, no! (objects crash) Erich! - Powers up. - Hey, guys. Look what I found. Now let's see how that mother fucker feels with a cap in his ass. What? (mirror shatters) (people shouting) - Move, move! (gun blasting) No! - Erich? - They took him. - Come on. - What? (groans) (thunder cracking) - If Erich is still alive we can pinpoint his location on our computer system. Come on. There! - Yeah, yeah, it looks like someplace under the dorm building. - Yeah, let's go. (thrilling music) (thunder cracking) - We can cut across the roads! No, come back, come here! - [Phantom] Molly! - I am sick of running from this piece of shit. You go get your boy, Molly. No, go, go! Come on, fucker! (grunting) (gun blasting) (shouting) (groaning) Go, Molly! (screaming) (thumping) - [Phantom] Molly! (screaming) We must live on. (dramatic thudding) - What do you want from me? What do you want? You've already taken everything that I've ever had! There is nothing left! For the first time, I know what it's like to have you out of me! And I came to tell you that you can't come back! You are not welcome! Do you hear me? Never, you coward! (dramatic music) - [Phantom] Molly. You must live on. You shall miss me, Molly. Nothing much separate us. (thrilling music) Molly. (wind howling) You must come back to me. We must leave this place together. We will be one again. You asked me what I want from you. - Let him go, please. - Perhaps. But you must come to me first. You know what it is I want. - Yes. - You feel it. We must be one. I want you to leave me here to die. - Nothing would make me happier. - But you value this one? - Yes. - No one shall come between us. You were born of my flesh and my blood. Join me. And I will spare his life. - I know you as well as you know me. I can't deny who I am anymore. You are a part of me. Always have been, always will be. - Molly, don't. - I'm so sorry you had to care for me. This has to stop now. - No! (gun blasts) (sword slams) (distant laughing) (screaming) - [Man] Hold her, hold it. (monitor droning) - What happened to her? - Go! Pulse in her! - [Man] Move it, move it! - No! (monitor droning) Shut it down. Shut it all down. It's over. It's over. (dramatic music) (screaming) (object crashing) - [Man] Doctor! - Get away from me! - Molly. You had a relapse. (shouts) (man groans) You fell back into the simulation. We tried to get you out. - Where are the others? No, no! - There was nothing we could do, Molly. - No! No! No. (crying) No! No. No. (scalpel clangs) - (gasps) No! (muttering groans) Let me out! (crazed muttering) - No, no. (distant shouting) (whimpering) (choking) (knocking) - Let me die. Help me. I wanna die! (choking) (Grant shouts) - What the heck is going on out there? (electricity crackling) (paper ripping) Molly, things are kinda piling up this morning. - None of it was real. None it was real.
