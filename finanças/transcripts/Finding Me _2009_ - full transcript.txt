Faybien. Faybien. Faybien. What? What time is the interview? What? What time is the interview today? 10:15, what time is it? 9:58. Are you serious? Oh my god, dad, I got to go. Had you not gone out last night, you wouldn't be late for your interview today. Dad, please. Faybien, Faybien, you're not going to get that job. You don't go to school and you're late. Why would they hire you? Dad. Hi. My name is Faybien Allen and I had an interview with... Paula Smith? Yes, Paula Smith. Allen. Yeah, you're appointment was for 10:15 and it's now 11:30. Yeah, I know, there was a lot of traffic. Well, a phone call would've helped. Yeah, I know, I wasn't thinking. I'm sure. Have a seat. Oh, sorry. Hi Paula, sorry to interrupt. So this guy's here and he's about 45 minutes late for his interview, yeah. Mhm, OK, I'll tell him. Mr. Allen, Paula can't see you today because you missed your scheduled appointment and she's going to be wrapped up in a lot of meetings. Uhm, can I please reschedule? I'm afraid not, have a nice day Mr. Allen. OK. Damn. So what happened? Dad, I was too late. What did I tell you? Dad, I'm sorry, but please... I don't you know about you, man. I don't know about me either. You drop out of school so you can go and work at a department store in the mall. Is this your future? Is this your future? Is this what me and your mother sacrificed to come to this country for so that our son can drop out of school to be an in a mall? Is it? No dad. What, Faybien, what do you want to do with your life? I don't know dad, I don't know. Exactly, exactly. You don't have any money saved. You don't have a car. You have a stupid dead ass job, but you're always finding time to be with these friends of yours. Dad, I have to get ready for work. You don't even have a girlfriend or anything. Look at you Faybien, just look at you. You look like a... I don't even know what you look like Faybien. But I know that if your mother were here, she would be ashamed of you. Oh, I don't even care how many calories this bad boy has, and I know I shouldn't be eating this before lunch, but it looked to good to pass up. What's wrong? It'll be three years this coming Friday and I'm still letting her down. So you missed your interview. There will be others. Come on. If you only could have heard how mad my dad was. In a lot of ways, I don't blame him. But your dad is from the islands, and they have a different way of seeing things all together. He's right about one thing, though. I have no kind of savings. I mean, what have I been doing with my money? If I had some, I'd move out and not have to deal with his crap anymore. You know he almost called me a faggot? Yeah. I have to get out of there. What you need is a sugar daddy that'll take care of you. Hey, what's up man? I really wish I didn't miss that interview. I hate working at the mall. Well at least you got a job, man. Try looking at it that way. A job I hate. You know, I'm not wanting to sell shoes for the rest of my life. Look, enroll back in college, man. Once you get back into the swing of things, it won't be so hard. Easy for you to say. I'll essentially be starting from scratch. OK, well at least I didn't have to spell that one out for you. Greg, the guy I was talking to you about, the one that's at the bus stop every Thursday. Man, you better go up and say something to him. - Where are my panties? - No. You know, I'm still trying to figure out why he's always at the bus stop. He's always, no Greg. - Where are my panties? - Listen, I don't know. Listen, go up behind him, you say he's always listening to his music so he's probably not paying attention to you anyway. Shut up Greg. Where are my panties? I gots to go. Please do something so I don't have to hear this tired story again, bye. I just wanted to say I think you're handsome. Sexy. There, I did it. That wasn't too bad. Thanks, you're handsome yourself. I, I wasn't, I mean, I didn't mean to, I wasn't talking to you. Well, we're the only two people here, who else you going to be talking to? I was practicing my lines. I'm an actor. An actor, right? Yeah, and again, I'm really sorry for disturbing you. It's cool man, my name is Lonnie. Nice to meet you. What's your name man? Again, I'm really sorry for disturbing you. What's your name? Faybien. Nice to meet you, Faybien. And for the last time, you wasn't disturbing me. I'm kind of glad you interrupted my little trance. It finally gives me a chance to talk to you. Well, you usually get here in just enough time to catch the bus and that doesn't leave much room for me to holla at you. Why would you want to holla at me? What do you think? Am I making you nervous? No. I'm just trying to strike conversation. Why don't we just exchange numbers? What for? For the same reason two people that's attracted to each other exchange numbers? Wait, who said anything about anybody being attracted to anybody? Are you saying that you're not attracted to me? You know what, because if that's the case, I'll leave you alone. I just found out that you're a bit cocky. I'm not cocky, confident. There's a difference. I don't know about that. Well, why don't you just take my number and find out. You got a phone? Yeah. Can I have it? Here you go. It's Lonnie. Two N's and a big L. So, I'll look forward to it, tonight. I'm going to go this way. Talk to you later. You know, I didn't know you started interviewing yet, let alone found someone already. When is this guy moving in? Tomorrow. You serious? Yeah. What's his name? Uh, Jaylin. He likes to be called Jay, though. I think he's cool. Not that cool if he's taking my get away room. You know, where am I going to go now when I want to escape my dad? Say hello to your get away couch. You knew this day was coming. My dad my own this place, but he is not letting me live here rent free. It was nice while it lasted, though. Yes it was. So tell me about this man. What else is there to know? Is he cute? Yeah, but, he was arrogant. Oh, I like a cocky man. As long as he can back it up. No, I think it's a turnoff. Well, tell me this, was he licking his lips. You know how L.L. does that shit. - Ew. - That is so annoying. I like it. No, but he was staring at me hard. It was almost like he was penetrating me. Penetrating you? Yous a nasty, you just met him and you already having thoughts of him getting up in that? No, I mean he was up, never mind. You make that boy blush. Let me ask you a question. Let's say you met him at a coffee shop or a book store, would you want to talk to him then? Yeah, I probably would. OK, well I think you should call him. If he's cute, why not. Yeah. Tell me this, could you see his print? Print? Come on now, his print. His little man. Greg, you know I was not looking for that. Did you see it? Yeah, yeah, I guess my eyes accidentally looked into that direction. Yeah, that's what I thought. How'd it look? It was there. That's nasty. Well at least we know he's working with something. So is that your only requirement for a man? Sometimes, but I usually like what's going on in the booty area. And for a woman? He's strictly an ass man when it comes to the women. Don't worry baby. I'll give you a call. Oh, I know you would. I just don't think I'm ready for a man in my life. Damn, what you talking about? Just a little bumping and grind, you talking about a man? No, no, no, no. Faybien sees fairy tales and love stories. It's not a date, it's a relationship. That's not true. I've been in my share of relationships. It's just not what I'm thinking about right now. What is wrong with him? Get on my fucking nerves. Didn't you come here to help? And break a nail? I don't think so. Faybien, why don't you get get that bag in there? Thanks. Already got it. Why did you come here if you wasn't going to help? Moral support. And you cooking. Hello. Hey, what's up Jay, I thought you weren't moving in til tomorrow? Oh, I couldn't take anymore of my place, and I was kind of anxious to move in. But, I guess I should have called first. Well that's alright. Let me introduce you to my friends. This is Amera. This is Faybien. Nice to meet you guys. Nice to meet you, too. Where are you from? Oh, West Kenny Section and North. Oh, I get my hair done over there. Oh I know that's right, your hair is looking fabulous. Thank you. But you're still not staying here tonight, right? We're going to chill out for the night. Oh, OK, I guess I could stay at my place one more day, but I can keep my stuff in here, right? Oh yeah, sure, that's cool. Let me talk to you for a minute. The reason why you can't move in tonight is because my boy is depressed, we're going to chill out, do the thing, cook a little bit, you're alright with that, right? OK, but yeah, I have a lot more stuff, so. Yeah, go ahead. Watch yourself. It was nice meeting you guys. Likewise. He seems nice. Yeah, as long as he pays the rent on time, I'm alright. I'm really going to miss my home away from home. Oh, so sorry, here you go. Thank you so much. Oh my god, you scared me. So either you're not interested, or you're playing hard to get, which one is it? What are you doing around here? What did you say to her? I told her it's the best coffee in the city. This is where I get my coffee from. I'm a creature of habit. Now back to the question. You really are persistent, aren't you? Now you're dodging. But at least I got you smiling. And something tells me it doesn't take too much to, you know, get that handsome face of yours to smile. You think you can read me like a book, huh? You know, I have good hunches. Now back to the question. Oh god, I just lost it. Oh, you lost my number. Well lucky for you, you bumped into me again. You are so cocky. What did I tell you? Yeah, yeah. Alright, you know what? Hold this. Give me this. What are you doing? So you won't lost my number. Alright, because we know how unreliable cell phones can be, so, unless you wash your hands, I'll be hearing from you tonight, right? Right. Good chef at a hot new restaurant. I'm not a chef, I'm a cook. Well, you're well on your way to becoming one. I'm on my way to becoming an executive chef. But, um, stop gassing my head up. I'm not gassing your head up, but you know what I'm saying is true. You ain't never told a lie. Right, right. You set your goals and go for it, no matter what. I wish is was like that. Alright, I know you ain't come all the way down here to gas my head up man, what's going on? And shouldn't you be at work right about now? I'm selling shoes. There's nothing exciting about selling shoes. I mean, nothing to make me want to rush to anyway. Alright, what did we talk about last week, man? You got a J O B. That's what's worth rushing too, man. And you should be on cloud nine right about now after meeting ole boy, right? No, I mean, this is exactly why I'm feeling this way. I don't know what he does for a living, but whatever it is, it's interesting, it's got to be interesting, more interesting than whatever the heck I'm doing. So what? So, I mean truthfully, tell me, would you date a guy who is dropped out of college, who's working at the mall selling shoes making just above minimum wage, I mean, I know I wouldn't. Man, I wouldn't even know all that information if I just met you, and actually, if I just met you, all I'd be trying to worry about is, um, how I'm going to get up in them drawers. Greg, come on, yo, I'm serious. Alright, alright, I was joking man. Your dad has really done a number on you. So since when have you started caring about what people think about you? What kind of job you have or whether or not you have a degree, that shit doesn't make you who you are. And if ole dude does not like you for who you are, fuck him. And that goes for anybody else for that matter, including your pops. The rules of life according to Greg. Get up on it man, that shit works. I have no room for haters in my life. Nobody telling me what I can and can't do. But see, that's so much easier for you to say, Greg. I mean you don't have a father constantly reminding you of how much a failure you are. You don't think me and my dad come to blows? You don't understand, Greg. I'm trying to. Yo, your dad has really fucked you up, man, that dude is like poison. He's still my father, Greg. Alright, I'll back off, I won't say anything about him, but what do you want me to do? I'm sitting here, I'm listening to you beat yourself up. Yo, you are not the loser you make yourself out to be. If you were, you wouldn't be able to hang out with me. I got an image to maintain. But since your so sensitive about your daddy, I won't talk about him. But when it comes to ole dude, I think you should go out with him. I don't know Greg, I just don't know. I mean, what do I have to offer him? And, you know, I just feel so messed up. So messed up I can't have anybody in my life right now. Hello, I'm still talking here. Sorry man, but look at that mans jeans, yo. They are tight as hell. Got a little slit in the back, like showing that ass. No he's showing his business. I thought you wasn't into flamboyant men? Who the fuck told you that? Excuse me, but seriously. Aren't you afraid of what people may think? That your gay, especially walking around with someone like him? I don't care what people think when I'm walking around the streets with you. Really Greg? Look man, this is your father talking, see what I'm saying? He can act and look any way he wants too, especially on this end of Jersey City. Well lucky for you, you live down here. Alright, so there's nothing I can say that can cheer you up, man. Look, you've got to snap out of this mole jam, man. You're starting to worry me. I've never seen you this depressed this long. You got to start learning how to appreciate life. Things could be a whole lot worse, man. You're right, you are, sorry. It's just kind of hard to see the light at the end of your own tunnel sometime, you know? And that's why I say you should go out with ole boy. If for nothing else, just a distraction. And what better distraction than a long hard dark stiff date. Hello. Hey, this is Faybien. Well it's about time. I didn't know I was on a time limit. I thought it was an open invitation. It was, but it wasn't like I wasn't biting my nails waiting for you to call. You got jokes. Yeah, I got jokes, but I'm glad you called, though. This will finally give us a chance to talk to each other without being rushed. If you noticed me all this time, why didn't you ever say anything? Because, I was too shy to step to a P.Y.T. One, I doubt that you're the shy type, and two, I ain't some pretty young thing. You are to me. Are you always this forward? Look, life is too short not to be. But check it, I'm really not into these long phone conversations, how about we meet today for lunch? What's the rush? There's no rush, I just feel that, you know, when you talk to somebody over the phone, you get a totally different vibe than talking to them in person, so let's meet today for lunch, 3:30. Are you asking or telling me? I'm asking you. OK. Good, so, um, I'll see you at 3:30 then. Sorry I'm late. It's OK. I'm glad you didn't stand me up. I wouldn't do that. OK, so. So? Who is Faybien Allen? Well, for starters, I feel like I'm on an interview. Then I'm doing something wrong. Clearly those are not my intentions. I want you to be relaxed and be yourself. Menus. Thank you. Can I get you guys something to drink? Yeah, can I have a ginger ale? And do you guys carry Prestige? Yes. Prestige? Beer? - Beer for lunch? - Yeah. Having a rough day? Not having a rough day. I just, you know, I like Prestige. Do you drink? No. I'm still curious, just how bold are you? Faybien, let me tell you something. When you see something that you want, you should go for it and throw caution to the wind. It's not everyday a good looking brother tells me I'm handsome, sexy. About that? Oh, you didn't? No. Not in the head space today, right now. Besides, I'm trying to get a better job and better my life. So, you're not interested in dating? No, it's not that, it's just I'm not looking, but if the right man comes along, I wouldn't turn him away. So describe this right person. OK, um, someone with a great personality, good sense of humor, and a kind heart. That's sweet. Someone I can trust who trusts me. Someone who's focused and head strong. Knows how to love and be loved in return. You know, I know that sounds like a lot, but those are the kind of qualities I want in a person. Doesn't seem like much to me. What about you? Are you in the market for love? Well I don't know anything about no market, but I'm looking for someone with a good heart. And I can tell you have that. You don't even know me. But that doesn't mean I can see that you have a good heart. Is this cocky attitude of yours an everyday thing? It's just my exterior. When you get to know, if you get to know me, you'll see that I'm not like this. You feel it don't you? Feel what? The spark, the connection. That could be you just trying to get into my pants. Can I take you guy's order? No, we didn't get a chance to look over the menu. Just a few minutes. This is a G-rated lunch. I'm forward, but I'm not that forward. Yeah, right. You know what, Faybien, it's about the chase. If there's no chase, then there's no point. There's no fun in it. Oh, so this is a game to you. No, no, no, no, no, this is not a game. This is not a game to me, I feel a spark. So what exactly about the spark are you feeling? I don't know, where's, where's that waiter? Hey. Hey, it's me. What's up Faybien? I just wanted to say thanks for lunch today. I had a really good time. I had a good time, too. So, will I be getting to see you again? Maybe. Listen, remember when we was talking about our favorite black movies, on the count of three, let's say, you know, tell each other our favorite black movies, and if it's the same one, you get to come over and watch it, together. One, two, three, - Love Jones. - Love Jones. Wow, that's what's up. That's that spark I'm talking about. He just knew things about me. Things that I didn't even know about me. Take my advice, and heed my warning. What? Don't sleep with that man. Oh my god, who said anything about sleeping with him? More importantly, why not? Because this is a crucial moment for him to build a lasting relationship. Say it with me now, class. Lasting relationship. There's no better way to get to know someone than when sex is not involved, and I mean really getting to know them. No, sex is the best way to get to know someone. Look, there ain't nothing like meeting a fine motherfucker and finding out he can't fuck. I say drop it on him. You guys, I'm going to let you know now. I'm not having sex with him. Yeah, OK. Oh ye of little faith. Isn't it difficult enough to get to know someone these days, why complicate it by having sex? Says the woman who hasn't had sex in how long? Choke. Listen, if it's meant to be me having sex with him, it won't really matter, right? Exactly. But Amera has a point too, sex does complicate things. Well, sex doesn't complicate anything for me. Says the man that's been single for how long? By choice, baby, by choice. Lying to yourself. Well, I'm not having sex with him, and you know, I don't even know if I want to see him again. Why not? Because I have a goal, finding me. Finding out who I am and what I want in this world. There's nothing like a little interaction to make everything else clear. I say go out with the boy, jump in that bed with him. Do it until the backboard comes crashing down. Oh my god. You really do have a one track mind, don't you? Well, we did agree to watch a movie at his place. Well do it, but don't do it. Do it. I'm not having sex with him, but, I think I will see him again. That's my boy. Hey. I would've picked you up if you weren't so damn stubborn. I don't mind catching the bus, it's not all that bad. Come on in. Upstairs. Woah, this is a nice place. Yeah, thanks. It's pretty big for one person. How long have you lived here alone? About a year now. OK, woah. So you had a roommate? No, I used to live here with my ex. This him? Yeah, that's Eric. Are you still close? Yeah, we're very close. Well, how long were yall together? Five long years. Were all of them happy? Yeah, it was good. No drama, he knew what he wanted and so did I. OK, well, he looks a little older than you. So, do you like older men? He's a couple of years older than me, and no, I don't just like older men. So what kind of men do you like? Are you talking in age? Yeah. I don't have a type. Well, he's very handsome. Yeah, he's a great guy. But enough about my ex. I'm going to go in the kitchen and make some popcorn, and you know, just make yourself at home. So, um, what do you do for a living if you don't mind me asking? I don't mind. I'm a union organizer. Really, I mean, do you like what you do? Yeah, it's alright. So, um, you're an activist. I wouldn't say all that. I like to help people out any way that I can. Some people are really against unions. I mean some may even call you a radical. Well thank god I don't live for some. I do what I do to help people. Everyone needs help, right? Don't flatter yourself. Yeah, that's my glasses. So listen, Fabe, I'm trying to decide which painting to put in my bedroom over my bed. That one over there, or this one right there. What you think, that one or this one? I got to say I like that one. Really, why? Because it gives you that nice warm good morning feel. I mean I wouldn't mind waking up to that. Would you, trying to spend that night? No, silly. OK, I can see that. Hey. I can smell the popcorn. Do I make you nervous? No, I'm just taking it all in. So, who chose the painting? You or your ex? You're so inquisitive. Sorry. Don't be. It's alright, I enjoyed it. I'm going to get the popcorn. Alright, so here's the popcorn and let's watch Love Jones, hold this. Yeah, let's get ready for that. Ready? Mhm. OK. Why you sitting all the way over there? I'm comfortable. Look, I have a strict rule. Have a good movie and a P.Y.T, he has to sit next to me. Oh really? Yeah. Either you come over here or I come over there. Come on. Come on, Fabe. Alright. But you won't try anything funny? Not at all. Good morning. Good morning. How are you? Good. Look at you in my shorts. How did you sleep? Good. Although, when I woke up and I didn't see you, I was quick to look over the nightstand for dollar bills. Now why would there be dollar bills on the nightstand? Sorry, bad joke. Very bad joke. So you hungry? Yeah, what do you have? My famous pancakes with bananas, because I know you like bananas. Oh, really? Yeah. You'll like them, they're great. So what are your plans for today? Go home, do some laundry. And then tonight? Not much, why? Good, so that means you can come see me. Arrogant to the end. Are you asking or telling me? What do you think? I'm asking. How about I get back to you on that? OK, promise? Mhm. So I'm going to give you some pancakes, the bananas, it's going to be good. But does the whole cab have to smell like curry, too? Amera, he can hear you. Well I hope he hears this, faster, please. I'm sitting in oil and I don't even want to think about what is crawling around on these floor boards. You know wearing open toed shoes in a cab is a gamble sometimes. You really are nervous, aren't you? You think? Amera. I'm sorry, yes, I hear there's going to be a music exec in the audience tonight. This could be my big break. You'll be great. Oh, I hope so, because if my voice cracks or I'm off key, I'm seri1ously going to crawl on the floor and curl up like a baby and cry. That's not going to happen. Are you sure my hair still looks fabulous? Yes. OK, so tell me about your date with Lonnie. It was cool. We watched Love Jones at his place. Is that all you did? Yeah. Whore, slut, you slept with that man. What? Bitch, don't lie to me. I see it written all over your pretty little face, you slept with that man. I can't believe you. How was it? Oh my god, Amera, was it so good. His body felt so strong and hard. It was incredible. I mean but even more than just the sex. The conversations with him are just so different than with other guys. Well of course. He's not like these little chicken heads running around here. That's why I only date older more sophisticated men. Oh, I hope I meet one tonight. You will. If we ever get there. Sorry. He has a passion for life. Like you, I admire your focus and drive. I mean, you guys know what you want to do with your lives, but don't you ever have doubts? Nope, I'm going to be a singer, hell, I am a singer, and that's all there is to it. I just don't want my tombstone to read. Faybien was kind hearted, a good dresser and gay. Aw, it'll say he was cute, too. Oh my god, are we there yet? Yes. Just drop us off up front. Yes, it is here, bitch. Faybien, I need to make an entrance, will you please go outside and open the door for me? Thank you. And I heard what you said, you little son of a bitch. I smell like curry. No Amera, you smell like roses. I really like this guy, I just don't know. What can I possibly offer him? No one's here. You're a man of quality, don't ever forget that, come on. You know what, it's just weird going to a club while the sun is still out. It's not a club, it's a tea party, I mean haven't you guys ever been to a tea party? I been t-bagged. No, not t-bagged, tea party. Alright so, we're sticking together tonight, right? You better ask Buffy the Booty Slayer. Look, I'm grown, we can split up. Alright guys, we need to stop this bickering and bantering. Please, let's just have a good time today. For me, please? Alright, truce. For a day, for Fay? Alright, let's go. What's up? What's up? What's your name? I'm Keith. Where did that negro go? He's probably down a dark alley. Just like him. So, where did you go? Oh, I was getting acquainted with my new friend, Keith. I can't believe you already met somebody. Oh, you know how I do, man, I gots to get busy. Oh my god, that's him. Who? The guy over there with the white shirt and grey scarf. Oh man, not bad, not bad at all. Stand up for me, please. I was supposed to give him a call a few days ago. And you didn't, man? I thought he put that thing on you. I wasn't supposed to have sex with him. I guess I understand, being celibate and all. How long has it been, like a year? Greg, OK, OK, can you just cover me while I hit the door, please? Man, you are not running out of here. Well what am I supposed to do, then? Go talk to him. Well, I just... Look who I found. What are you guys looking at? Fay's being a punk, as usual. Oh, who's that? That's the dude that fucked... Lonnie, that's Lonnie. That's Lonnie, Hun, he is a catch. Is that your boyfriend? He could be, if Fay wouldn't walk around torching himself. Can you believe he's hiding? Hun, you should go over there and talk to him. Because if you won't, I will. If you won't somebody else will. Well fine then. You know what, I'm done. What is your problem? I just don't feel like being tag teamed right now. And besides, he's just another guy. No, he's the guy you had a deep connection with. And was that a threat from Jay? You know what? Let's dance. Come on, let's dance. Hey. Hey. What you drinking? Whiskey. Mhm, that's a hard drink. Naw, not when you get used to it. I know that's right. Did you come here alone? Yeah. I guess I came at the right place at the right time. Excuse me. Wait a minute now. You need a drink, huh. Yeah, ugh. So you just going to stare at him all night, or are you actually going to make a move? I'm not as bold as you and Greg. I don't make it a habit of sleeping with someone so quickly and then seeing them out. I just don't know the proper protocol for this awkward situation. Look, there is no protocol. Obviously he's feeling you, you're feeling him. You have been dodging this man's phone calls, you can't dodge this. Boy, you better get those nasty lips away from me and help me talk your friend into talking to Lonnie. We are not still on this. - No. - Yes. Look, here's what you're going to do. You're going to go out there and you're going to ask him to dance. That's your brilliant plan? Ask him to dance? They're not even playing anything fast. Exactly, Einstein. There's now way he's going to dance with you on this empty dance floor to slow music. He's going to think it's a little jokey joke. You're attempt on breaking the ice. That sounds crazy. I don't know. Look, what do you got lose? You already gave up the ass. And speaking about ass, I'll be back. He's so nasty, but he has a point. You already slept with him, don't you think you should be over all this shyness? Go and talk to him. You owe me a drink. Work it. Hey. Hey. Want to dance? Sure. Wait, wait, wait, you don't have to. I was just playing. So, you don't want to dance with me? Well not in the middle of the dance floor while everybody's watching. Don't you feel uncomfortable? No, should I? Lonnie, but... Listen, don't you think I deserve a dance after you've been ignoring me all night? Especially with you not returning any of my phone calls? Wait a minute, not like this. I'm not comfortable. Listen, relax. Drown all the noise and everything else out. Just listen to the music, feel the music, feel me. Oh, I am so sorry, that is... That's OK, I'll be back. Yeah. Are you OK? I can't believe him. Maybe it was just an accident. But the two of you dancing, that was so beautiful. It was embarrassing, and everyone is staring. I'm out of here. Greg, We're ready to go. Greg. We'll be at the car. Lonnie is fine. You said, and I quote, it was more than just sex. He has a soul. Isn't that everything you're looking for? Yeah, you guys are right, you're right. I'm just making this much more complicated than it really is. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph he's got it. Greg, I'm not dense. I know, but it does take a minute for it to get around the corners. We should go out tonight. No, I don't think so. But I do think I want some of this rum cake, thank yall. No, we had so much fun the other night. Mhm, at my expense. I don't want to go back to Chi Chi's. I don't want to go there and everybody expect me to break into a slow dance. And what if Lonnie's there? So you're hiding from him now? Didn't you just say we were right? Come on, I want to go out. So we don't have to go to Chi Chi's, but I want to dance all night. Are you down Greg? Oh I am, you know what, Jay will be home in a few minutes, we should invite him out. How about we don't? So you can see that he's not as bad as you think he is. Oh my god. What is wrong with you? Greg, why do you have a dildo in the dishwasher? Hello, I was following the instructions on how to... It is so nasty and big. Can a rectum really take all this? Oh, you'd be surprised. I'm going to pass you the rum cake. Oh, hey yall. Hey, what's up Jay? You want to go out tonight? Oh, for sure. And there's this new spot that just opened up. What? Yes. Three against one, Hun, you're coming. Oh, you wasn't going to go out? Aw, come on, Faybien, you know I wanted to see you dance. What, so you can spill another drink on me? That was an accident. - Y'all see that? - Sure. Is something on your mind? Nope. Well, sweety, you know you can always come and talk to me, right? My door is always open. But speaking of which, I'm going to call my boy, the one working the door, get us in for free. What's the name of the place? Old Pretty Club Sugar Daddies. Oh, I got to go there. You had your chance, now Let's go out, and have a good time. I just don't think I'm going to have any fun. Woah, the kids were out in full front tonight, and so were my girls. Don't you think that was messed up? What, what Jay did? He is Greg's roommate, it's not like he's your friend. But I think that says a lot about his character. It also shows how pitiful you've been acting, lately. What is going on? I guess being labeled a pretty boy all this time, it's finally wearing off. Look, I hear you, I really do. But let's not jump the gun here. So you've already slept with him. That doesn't mean it's meaningless. You have to find meaning for yourself by yourself. He should have nothing to do with that. How... All I'm saying is Lonnie could be different. And spring's eternal. When did you become so cynical? Where is Greg? What is going on? I'm sorry. Are you OK? Yeah, yeah yeah. You know that boy I met at the club? The one I was kissing on? Right. He had a boyfriend. I'm sorry, I didn't know he had a boyfriend. You didn't know? I didn't know. So you're trying to tell me they are fighting in there, and you're out here? Dummies. You know what, that lounge was wack anyway. I got some tension I need to relieve. Let's go to the club. OK, I got a few more shakes in my booty. Damn. Cool. What are you doing here? I like live music. I'm beginning to think that you're stalking me. You would like that, wouldn't you? What's your excuse? My best friend just got done performing. Aw man, she was great. She was. So, Fabe, what's up with these disappearing acts? You're one of those, aren't you? One of what? One of those dudes that just sleep with men and leave them out to dry. No, I'm not. - Yes you are. - I swear I didn't. Yes, you are. I'm just kidding. I was, too. Oh, so you're a smart ass. Don't sleep. No, but really, when am I going to see you again? Why is everything so urgent with you? Why are you always dodging my questions? Why are you always answering a question with a question? You know what, this whole bantering thing is cute and all, but I'm starting to think that this is a game to you, and I'm seriously not into games, so, I'm going to leave. No, Lonnie wait, don't go. I want to see you again, but that's all I know. Anything beyond that, I can't say. Faybien, what you think I'm looking for? Now and forever? What are you afraid of? Hey, Hun. Hey, Amera, you did excellent. I know. Amera, this is Lonnie, Lonnie, Amera. Nice to meet you, you have a beautiful voice. I know, thank you. When you're ready to leave, just let me know. It was a pleasure meeting you, you look beautiful. Thank you. I'm glad that we ran into each other again. Yeah. This finally gives us a chance and to really get to know each other. Yeah, mhm. OK, so let's stop kissing and talk. OK, we can talk. OK, let's talk. What's wrong, Fabe? Let's just calm down, and talk. OK, we can slow down. What's wrong, Faybien? I just feel like we may be moving too fast. What's wrong Fabe? OK, I want us to sleep together. Oh, trust me, we are. No, I want us to sleep, and nothing else. Why? I just, I just want us, you to hold me. Let's lay together. OK. I thought that'd be nice? Yeah, that'll be nice. You won't mind, would you? Why would I mind? OK. Great. Good morning. I had a good night's rest. How did you sleep? I slept great. Really? I didn't even feel you get out of the bed. That's because I was sleeping on the couch. You kicked me out of the bed. Baby, why you didn't wake me up? I tried to, but you were dead to the world. I was cold and uncomfortable. Wait, why are you finding this funny? Wait, why are you laughing? Wait, I'm going to kill you. Wait a minute. What? Wait a minute, maybe because, maybe I realized that little stunt you pulled last night wasn't cute. What? I just want to, just hold me, I don't want to have sex. No, no, no, no, no. Oh, oh, yeah you see? Saved by the bell. Hello? Hey, where you at? I'm with Lonnie. Oh, that's what's up. No, it's not, he kicked me out of the bed. Um, I need a little more information. I'll tell you later, but, so, what's going on? Nothing, I just wanted to remind you to bring dessert. Oh, I totally forgot about your get together for Jay. Can I skip it? Naw, Fay, you better get over yourself, man, I want him to feel comfortable. I have a feeling he's quite comfortable. What's going on, somebody's having a party? Yeah, my friend Greg, he's having a get together for Jay, his new roommate. Cool, I want to come. Hey, invite your boy. I don't think he'd want to come. Yeah, I do. See you at seven, don't forget dessert. I mean, you really want to go? Yeah, only if you want me to come. No, no I would love it if you came, only after I kick your ass. Oh damn, everything looks good as hell up in here. Oh, thanks. Would you take this out for me? Oh. Oh, OK. So, you two got back together after all? Yeah, I took everyone's advice. Smart move, he's a keeper, someone else would have snatched him up. Why do you keep on saying that? I'm just saying. Should I be worried? I would. Let me ask you a question? Is it what are my intentions for Faybien? No. Because Amera was already all over me. No, no, no, I don't care about that, yo, I'm trying to look out for myself. Oh, OK. You got any eligible brothers you know? Jay's a snake. Oh, why you say that? Because he practically threatened to make a move on Lonnie. Are you serious? I'm going to have to let him know that this not a game. This is cute. You are ready to fight for your man. So, what do you enjoy at parties? Oh, it's alright, I mean, like, it's one of those things where... - Hey, Hun. - Hey. My glass is dry, could you? Definitely. Thank you. You know, I am loving this party, this nothing like what I'm used to. So, what is your crowd like? Oh, you know, typical loud ass faggy motherfuckers. I had to get out that scene. Mhm, I like my boys, and the company we keep. It would be ashamed if someone tried to mess with that. OK, but I heard that you were blowing the other night. Like ah, it was amazing. I'm going to have to see that live, you tore the roof of that, baby. I have been known to make people catch a holy ghost. I'm sure you have, mama. OK. Thank you. For what? Inviting me. No problem. Can I have everybody's attention? Just for a second, alright thank you. Everybody's alright? Alright. So, everybody raise their glasses. Take a look around. We may not all know each other and we may not even like each other at the same time, but at least we can get together and pretend. Everybody, cheers. Cheers. Come one, you're supposed to be looking forward. Yeah, I'm looking forward. No, you're looking down. You know I'm an old man. So, how often do you come up here? Every now and then. It's cool, I like it. I do, too. I can see you that. So what's your passion? I don't think I have a passion. Come on, Faybien. Everybody has a passion, of course you do. I guess I would vicariously through Greg and Amera's passion. Come on, you have your own. What's that one thing that wakes you up in the morning, that one thing that, you know, makes you feel alive? You are so dramatic. But I guess I would say music. I love the way it makes me feel. I mean, that's what made me attracted to you. Why do you like coming up here? I don't know, it allows me to clear my mind. I like being higher up. I almost feel closer to my mom. I just don't know. So what are you complaining about now? I'm not complaining, I'm just saying he's a workaholic. Well, at least he has a job, it's better than having none at all. True, because I've dated the dead beats, uh uh. Faybien, I once dated this one man that actually put his work before me, didn't work out. When did you allegedly date this alleged man? In yo dreams? No, it was your real daddy. That's right, you never met him. Guys, Lonnie is a very intelligent man. The most intelligent guy that I've ever been out with. That's right, because wasn't your last boyfriend his best friend? Hun, you have dated some dummies. Come on guys, shut up. I really like this guy. I think I like him too much, because he listens to me. He likes me, not this, but me. Aw, that's beautiful. But see that on the flip side is he's so busy with work the conversations are slim. But I'm so emotionally drawn to him, you know I don't even think I could get out even if I tried. So why would you try to get out of it. You see, this is the part of you that bothers the hell out of me, man. You better learn to accept the good things in life while they're knocking on your door. You're luckier than most. How many of us can say that we have a good man or woman in our lives? You better stop blocking them blessings. Alright, what're we eating? Have you ever asked yourself is love real? Who would? Who could even understand when I'm near him I am a skinny dumb knock kneed lanky drooling off the words of my ha rajah, or whatever words they use in those dry textbooks. But me, I'm a bitch, hot, panting for a pat from his hand so I can wag my love in front of his face. A princess, black, dopey with lust, waiting for the kiss of action from my prince. Now I know this whole seed is not cool and all, but it's real, it's alive, dig it. Sometimes we be so close, I think I can comp his pulse, hear my heart in his ears. Now ain't that love? That was beautiful, who's it by? Carolyn M. Rodgers. She entitled it Now Ain't That Love. It means love doesn't disappear nor die. Love doesn't make any sense. That's why it's so easy for us to lose ourselves to love. So the mistakes that you made in the relationships that you were in is all part of experiencing love. And love should not be an interruption of your life Faybien. It needs to be a part of it. But that's my problem. I can't separate the two. Stop criticizing yourself so much. Faybien, what's your biggest fear? Not finding out who I am or where I belong. Not getting the approval of my father or my community. Other people's opinions matter that much to you? My father isn't just other people. No, I ain't talking about your father. I'm talking about your community, the black community, that's who you're talking about, right? I am them, they are me, I mean shouldn't they matter? You know what, come on, let's get dressed. What are we doing? I want to try something with you, come on. What, what are we doing out here? I wanted to try something with you. What is that you want to tell the community? I don't know, I never thought about it. Think about it now, what is it that you want to tell them? We're definitely in a safe place, and I know there's things you can't tell you dad, but I know there's things you want to tell the community, so tell them. I guess I want them to accept me. But not just me. Every black male and female out there who feels like this. Who can't change who they are. Just because we're different doesn't mean we're not part of their community. OK. I want them to know that we are dying out there, each and every day, because of our ignorance. And this is time to wake up. So tell them. What do you mean? Tell the community how you feel. This is silly. It's not silly. Just do it, just tell them. Accept me, accept me. Lonnie, Lonnie. What? We got gangs around here, we can get jumped. I don't care about that. I think it's important that they hear it come from your soul, your voice. You have something to tell them, tell them. Yeah, I feel like I'm in a Spike Lee movie. Well, weren't going anywhere until you, you know, do it. You know what, I live right up the street, I could walk home from back... I'm walking home. Uh uh, fine, but you know what, you're going to lose. Do it for yourself. What, accept me. No, from your soul. Bigger, more. From your heart. Accept me. Yes. How do you feel? How you feel? Silly, but lighter at the same time. What is it about you that makes me feel so good? Well, maybe it's your heart you hear in your eyes. Come on, let's go. What were you doing out there? What are you talking about? I saw you making a fool outside with some guy. He's a friend of mine and I wasn't making a fool of myself. Oh, so what would you call it? Shouting out in broad daylight? I call it a release. Look, just shut up with this damn nonsense. You know what dad, I'm not going to stop. Faybien, if you think that you're going to disrespect my house, I'm going to hit you. You'll what, hit me? Beat me up? I'm not that scared little boy anymore. I'm not going to let you just hit me. So you're saying you're going to fight me? No dad, I'm going to leave. I'll be at a friend's place. Dad. Stop. Dad, dad. Dad. Stop, dad. I'm leaving, I'm leaving before we kill each other. Yeah, my door is always open to you, man. I even tried to call Jay and let him know you was coming past, but wouldn't you feel more comfortable at Lonnie's place? No, I don't want to lay all this mess on him. He doesn't deserve it. But if he's willing to be there for you. No, Greg. Alright, listen up. I've been listening to you whine for a long time now. You got your friends, you have your health, you got a man that's willing to be there for you. You're luckier than most. You got to learn how to put things in perspective. Now, I know I'm being harsh, but... No, if I didn't have you and Amera in my life, I'd probably be roaming the streets right now. It's just that, I've never fought my dad before. I saw this day coming but, I didn't ever think it would have been like this. Now I don't think I could ever go back home. Yeah, well you know, me and my dad have come to blows before, be we've always come back. Was it over your bisexuality? Sometimes, but I gave him no choice. Accept me or lose me. Either or huh? Well, that may not work for you, but you've got to stand your ground at some point. How could I stand my ground, especially when it's so shaky. You would think that after dating all these men for so many years, I would come to grips with it. Truth be told, I'm not. I'm still struggling with it. But you got to learn how to accept yourself and love yourself first. Want another drink? No. Track my pod, they don't ever meet up. When's the next time we can do this? Oh, I'll let you know. Give me the number to this place so I can call you, your cell phone is always disconnected. Man, go home. Next time, if you let me fist you, I'll give you more money. Man, go home, I'll call you later. It's that way. What's going on? Oh, shit. Oh, you scared the hell out of me. I didn't realize you was here. What? Are you pulling tricks here? Oh, sweety, that was just my friend. I heard someone wanted to pay you more if you let him fist you? Yes, you're turning tricks in Greg's apartment. You mean our apartment. Mine and Greg's not yours. And babe, before we even start this, let's not even try to get in my business. You know what, I'm not trying to get into your business, but you're brining your business here. Greg's family owns this place, you are just his roommate. Oh, so this is your job, right? To judge me? Who the fuck do you think you are? I'm Greg's friend, who do you think you are? You know you're funny right? Let me break something down to you. You actually remind me of myself, but when I was a little bit younger. I am nothing like you. And don't even think about changing the subject. I'm sorry, again, this is you showing concern for me, right? Sorry I fucking woke you, good night. So what's going on with you and your dad? I haven't made any attempt to reach out to him and neither has he. He's a stubborn old man. I didn't fall too far from the tree. I'm just sorry I wasn't there to help. It's OK, there was nothing you could do. You know if my place were bigger, you could stay with me. Thank you, but um, you know, Greg's couch is actually really comfortable. Um, it should be, because I dropped a G on that mug. I just can't believe you and your dad fought. Yeah, you know, I don't want to talk about it. Can we change the subject? OK. We can talk about my birthday. So I was thinking we could get DJ Cool from Newark, yall know he can lay it down. Can you afford him? Oh please, my dad's got that covered. It's not everyday his little girl turns 21. Oh shut up, whatever, 25. Greg, what's going on with my invitations? Everything's all taken care off, just a heads up, they might be getting there just a little bit late. Why? Because I got things to do. Greg, I asked you to give up one week to celebrate my birthday, was I really asking for too much? Yeah. Ugh, fuck. Oh hey guys. Had I known that yall would be here, I might look a little bit better than this. Are you just waking up? I mean it's only five o'clock in the afternoon. Long night, what you cooking? Gumbo. Oh, could I have some? Yeah, just give it a minute, it'll be ready. Oh, thanks. Girl, you made a rum cake last week for your nerves, I swear, that's going to make me fat. Jay, let me ask you a question. Shoot mama. Do you think there's anything wrong with me wanting to celebrate my birthday for a week? Shit, I celebrate mine for a whole motherfucking month. OK. So, Greg, what's the problem with me wanting to celebrate my birthday for a week? Amera, there's nothing wrong with you doing your birthday up, but you cannot expect everybody to drop everything they've got going for your birthday. Faybien is. And that's on him. I'm giving you a day, one full day, boop. I don't know why I'm so surprised, because you're just being true to form. Selfish to the end. Selfish? The gumbo smells really good, is it done yet? Yes, selfish. If it ain't about you, you can care less. Says the woman who wants the whole week to be about her. It's my birthday. Yeah, we all know that, but here's the gotcha Hun. I have shit to do before that week. I have shit to do during that week and I'm going to have shit to do after that week. Greg. No, no, no, no, let him say what he has to say. I don't have anything else to say. Good because I have plenty, so listen up floppy lops, what is the word I'm looking for, it's surprises me how full of yourself you are. You seem to think no one has things going on in their lives except for you, but contrary to popular belief, we all have full lives, but we make time for our friends because that's what friends do, but not you, though. Not the incomparable Greg Marsh. If it ain't about you, you could care less. You don't make time for anyone else's life but your own. Amera. You know what, I'll be there for your birthday breakfast brunch, and I'll even be there for your afternoon shopping spree, but you are getting on my shit because I'm showing up to your party a little bit late and you have the temerity to call me selfish? Woah. Biotch, you must have been sipping to much of the... No, you know what, no, I didn't realize mailing out and emailing e-vites was asking so much of you. I didn't mean for you to have to do anything strenuous, after all, we're only friends. Exactly, I'm your friend, and not your boyfriend. And might I add for your future boyfriend, god bless him. Are you serious? Everybody, take a corner, sit here, breathe. No, you know what, Greg? I'm going to make this real easy. You don't have to worry about anymore obligations. You don't have to come to my party. Amera, you didn't mean that. Hallelujah, praise the lord, thank you Jesus, there is a god. Gumbo's ready, anybody want some? I got my bowl. Boy, you are a piece of work. You better sing that shit to someone else. How about I sing a different tune? How about, uh, hmmm, bitches and shit but hoes and tricks? You better watch your motherfucking mouth. Fucking bisexuals. Oh, she went there. What? Excuse me, I got to hear this. Fucking bisexuals. You know what, shame on me to even consider you committing to a party when you can't even commit to a gender. So I think it's time for you to man the fuck up and choose a side. So what's it going to be? Dick or pussy? No she didn't. Well, sweetheart, why would I have to choose when bitches like you keep throwing pussy in my face? Did you just call me a bitch? Get up out of my house. Stop, woah, let's handle this like adults. Fay, it's cool, it's cool. Suck a dick. Oh, I'll suck a dick, get out. Call me girl. Did you have to go there? Come on man, did she? Damn, you put your ass in this gumbo. Look at this, paprika, cayanne pepper. That must have been some argument. Not the first of which. What does that mean? So, where are we going after I get the groceries out my father's house? Well, we'll go to dinner, sit outside, enjoy this nice beautiful weather, you know, because now since this whole craziness of the campaign is over, I want to celebrate with my man. Isn't it beautiful? What's wrong with up here? Isn't it obvious? No. Lonnie, I can't, I'm sorry. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just not into public affection. OK. I just don't think that there's anything wrong with not being into public affection, please, don't make a big deal about it. Just one of the many things I hate about being up here. OK. I should have known better. Should have known that you're not comfortable with who you are yet. I know we've been dating and all, but don't you think it's a little presumptuous of you to assume what I am or am not comfortable with? But that's what you're giving out. This is not my first time sensing this from you, either. What, are you keeping notes on me? In a way, aren't we both? I'm not keeping tabs on you. It's not keeping tabs, it's what you do when you're getting to know someone. How am I supposed to get to know you when you're always on your phone? What? I'm surprised it hasn't rung yet. I spend more time listening to your campaign conversations than actually talking to you. And I'm sorry I'm not as intellectually evolved in my sexuality as you are. I mean I know being gay isn't easy for everyone, but god you make it seem like it's nothing. Why are you trying to pick a fight? I'm not picking a fight. Yes, you are. I never said that is wasn't going to be easy. You think I became comfortable with who I am over night? Faybien, it took years. Even a little of some counseling. But you know what, everyone's journey is different. You have to admit this is who you are first. You don't think I have? I'm reminded of it everyday. Every time I'm at the bus stop, I see a straight couple kissing, and I'm reminded of the fact that I won't be able to do that without someone looking at me with either a straight... I wake up in the morning and I look in the mirror and you want to know what I see? A faggot. Faybien, Faybien, let me try to help you. What, how are you going to help me? Fabe, whose been doing this to you? Whose been feeding you this shit? Him. Your pops? The whole world. I know I can't keep on using them as an excuse, but it's hard to get out of this kind of thinking. Let me help you. What, how are you going to help me? By putting your work ahead of me? What? I just knew it. I knew it. The moment I let myself open up, I was going to get hurt. I just knew it. Baby, baby, what have I done to hurt you? What did I do wrong? So messed up. Lonnie, just walk away. Just leave me, I'm sorry. I don't have a mask of masculinity to hide behind. A mask? You think I'm wearing a mask? This is who I am. I know you're not wearing a mask, but I would be if I tried to pretend to be something that I'm obviously not. He kicked me out. Who? I been staying with Greg. Why you didn't tell me? Because my fucked up home life shouldn't be your problem. If you're my man, your problem, is my problem. You could have stayed with me. You're not my man. It's not fair to you. Lonnie, I'm going to go home now. Leave me alone. Just don't follow me, don't call me, just let me go. Faybien, Faybien, please, I don't want to let you go. Lonnie, just let me go. Hello? Hey Hun. Hey, Amera, can I call you back? I'm really trying to do laundry before my dad... Well what do you think about the other night? Don't you think Greg was being an asshole? Amera, can I seriously get back you later? I mean my request wasn't all that unreasonable. Have you noticed how selfish he can be? Well I noticed the both of you can be... Don't you dare, don't you dare take his side. I'm not taking anyone's side. Well maybe you should. You're always straddling the damn fence. Woah, woah, why are you coming at me? Because you're always taking his side or no side and it's damn annoying. You know what, Amera, I don't know what you want from me right now. I want you to be my friend, not you. I am a friend, to both of you. Then stop trying to be so PC and tell me how you feel. OK, the both of you can be selfish sometimes. Oh, so I'm selfish, taking his side again. I'm not taking anyone's side. Yes you are. You know what, I'm not in, I don't have, Amera, I don't have time for this right now. And I just broke things off with Lonnie. I got to say, I'm just not in the mood for this right now. I don't understand you, why would you break things off with that man? Because I feel like my life is just messed up and I don't need to be taking him down with me. Oh, stop being a victim. All of our lives fall apart at one time or another, but you don't see us trying to stop the good things from coming through. Little boy, I am so tired of your woe is me routine. This situation with your dad is the way it is because you will not stand up to him. I mean, if you have to move out and live on your own, then that's what you're going to have to do. But stop complaining about your problems and actually try to fix them. Just grow the fuck up. Hey Greg. Hey, what's up, man? Chilling. Did you run into your dad? No, but hey, thanks for letting me use your truck. No doubt. Hey, is Jay here? Naw, what's up? I have to tell you something and I'm not sure how it's going to sound, but there's something really shady about him. Yo, is this about what happened at the club the other night? I thought you would've been over that by now. It's not about that. So what's up? He, I don't want to jump to conclusions, but, he just gives me a bad vibe and I just think you should watch your back. And I think you should have a talk with him. Alright, man, but it seems like you're leaving something out, why don't you just tell me what you saw? It seemed like he was tricking. Trickin'? Yeah. Yo, in my... Yeah. Greg, I'm only trying to look out for you. Yeah, I know that man, but um, it seems like you got something against Jay, maybe it's because the two of you have some similarities. Greg, I can't believe you even said that. I'm nothing like that dude. Man, I'm just saying, he could be like an older version of you. Greg, stop it. Why are you getting so bent out of shape? You're doubting what I'm telling you. When have I ever lied to you before? Never, but you've never been under this kind of stress, either. I'm not stressed. Yes, you are. You've been going through a lot of things lately. You're fighting with your dad, you've been kicked out of your place, you're stressed and confused because you can't find a better paying job to get you out of that financial hole you're in. Man, all that leads up to stress. I know you man, I know when you've reached your limit. And when will you reach yours? Yo, what is that supposed to mean? When are you going to stop pointing out everybody else's short comings and look at your own flaws and mistakes? Well, we're not talking about me right now, are we? Well maybe it's time we did. You want to know why you and Amera keep bumping heads? Why? Because you both can be selfish and self centered. You know what, lately I've seen you turn into a different person. A whining whimpering low self esteem bore. Always crying and whining about your problems instead of dealing with them, and then you punish yourself and ultimately, the rest of us. Wow. You know, I didn't know you felt that way. I guess I'll leave. See, you're doing it now. What, what am I doing? Just know, I'm not kicking you out, this is your choice. Yeah, I know Greg, you're not kicking me out. You're above that, right? You're perfect. Crazy ass. Hey. Oh, hey Lonnie. How's it going? Oh, OK, it's fine, I believe. That's good, um, I thought you was going to perform tonight, are you singing? Oh, no, I'm just hear with some friends. Is Faybien here with you? No. Is he OK? I guess so. Well, you know, the last time I spoke with him, he seemed upset. He hasn't returned any of my calls. Well what can I say, classic Faybien in full effect. But is he alright? I'm worried. You know what, truth be told, I haven't even talked to him in about a week. We had a falling out. Really? Damn. You mean the world to him. You and Greg is all he talked about. What can I say, it's like that sometimes. But I'm worried. Well, I hate that he is pushing you away, I mean you seem like a good guy, but Faybien has this way of just balling up and closing out the world, even when it's crystal clear to him that he needs help, he would much rather fix it himself instead of inconveniencing anyone else. Well, you know, sometimes people need to figure themselves out. Look out for our little boy, he's a such special guy. Thanks, it was good seeing you. You too. Yo, Jay, hold up for a minute. I want to ask you a question. Hey, what's up? Yo, um, did you have company here a few nights back? Um, yes I did, is that problem? Naw, well, that depends. Oh, was that you're little friend Faybien on the phone? Don't worry about that, yo, I just want to let you know I don't want any shady dudes up in my apartment. Oh my god, Greg, you have nothing to worry about. I don't now shit where I sleep. Well that's good to know. See, now I feel like there's some tension between us all because your little friend Faybien has something to say, I didn't do anything wrong. I just want to let you know, Faybien is my boy, he's got my back, so just don't think you can come up here talking about him any way you want. I'm not about to sit here and walk around on egg shells, again, I pay rent too, and this is my place just as much as yours, and I don't appreciate her spying on me. He wasn't spying on you. Yes he was. He was sleeping on the couch. And I'm supposed to know that because? You might want to try picking up your phone. I called you and it wasn't even going to voice mail. I mean, Greg, but I mean a note, I mean something. I mean damn, I mean if I had done that to you, would you have appreciated it? Well, you seem to be forgetting a few things. What am I forgetting? This is my apartment. And that makes you better than me? That makes it whatever you comfortable with. Oh, you know what, you trippin', Greg, and it's not about Greg and his rules, I do have my right. Well just know, it is about my rights, so just don't go around here abusing shit. Greg, again, I pay rent. Like I said, I don't want any off the wall shit happening in my apartment. Ugh, yes sir. How you doing, my name's Corey. I'm here to, I'm here for the interview. Here you go, Corey. You can take a seat right on the couch over there. Alright, thanks. Excuse me, you got a pen I could borrow? Oh, yeah, sure, here. Thanks. That should definitely work. Yo, you here for that position that was in the paper? Yeah. I've been here for a while, so, hey, take your time with the application. You're children will take time, too. Don't you hate the way how they make you hurry up to come out here and you waste your time, and it's like they don't even take the time to call you back? Right, so you can make that uncomfortable yet all knowing follow up call just so they can tell you that they job has been filled. Yeah, I've been through it. It's almost like a profession, now. Yo, my name is Corey. Faybien. Yo, I really need a job man. Yo, that's what is about you man, you remind me of my little brother. Yo, you alright man? I'm sorry, yeah, I'm alright, I just been having a rough couple of weeks, lately. Naw man, I understand, bro. So, you're brother, does he have a girlfriend? Naw, he's got a boy, he's got a partner. He's gay? Naw, he's same gender loving. You know, he never never never goes by that term, gay. He's SGL, same gender loving. Why, you got a problem with homosexuality? No, not at all. Oh, OK, because I was just about to hop on my soap box bro. So you're OK with your brother being gay? I mean, SGL. It's not a matter of being OK, you know what I'm saying? I love my little brother. So, I guess you've met his partner before? Met, I mean every time they're in town bro, every time they're in town, we go to dinner. You're whole family? You know, I'm sorry, I have a bad habit of asking a lot of questions, so, don't mind me. It's cool man, I understand where it's coming from, you know. Yeah, the whole family, my girl too. At first, I mean my parents was totally totally totally not with it, but after a while, you know, they came around. It's not like Bradley gave them much of a choice, anyway. He forced your family to accept him. Not really forced, man. My brother's really really strong that way. You know what, families, families heal each other. I truly believe that. Mr. Allen, we're ready for you. That's you bro, go get them. Alright, well, good luck with everything. Good luck man. Good luck man. Alright. So you're back. Yeah, I am. So what are you doing? Trying to put some positive images around me. I see that you painted the hallways. It looks really nice. Look dad, I've been coming back for a little while now. I know. Think I don't hear you sneaking in when you think I'm asleep? So what happened, things didn't work out at your friends house? No, they didn't, but you know what dad, they're still my friends. And I mean, no matter what we go through, they will always be my friends. Because they know who I am and I know them and we wouldn't do anything to intentionally hurt each other. And you don't think I know you? Your mother and I had you when we were even younger than you are now. And? And maybe we know what it's like to be young and confused. I raised you for 21 years. You're young, you don't know what you want. You think this is it? You think this is confusion? I assure you, dad, I am not confused. You know, sometimes it's, sometimes I wish I was but I'm not. It's taken me a long time to be able to admit to myself... I don't want to hear this nonsense. That I'm just like you dad. I walk away from every situation instead of dealing with it. Leaving here was my running away, but I'm done running, dad. I'm your son. And I'm gay. And I'm sorry you hate that so much, and I'm sorry I can't change it. But here I am dad. Dad please, mom isn't here anymore to keep us together. You think your mother would approve of this? She knew about me. And you think she approved? She approved? Yeah. Your mother was disgusted by this. Stop, just stop. No, you stop with this business. You stop this, you hear me? Mom, loved me for who I am. She accepted me for who I am. How dare you try and take that away from me. Now I know you've just lost your damn mind. Who the hell you think you're talking to like that? I'm not one of these friends you hang out with. I'm may look to be as young as you are, but I'm still your father and you're not too old for me to whoop your ass and you're not too young to have some kind of respect in my damn house. What, and you think you knew my wife better than I did? I knew her better than anybody else. And I say she didn't approve. Stop, just stop. I can't believe you're saying this. Men act like men. Not like faggots. You think I chose this sexuality? I didn't choose my sexuality any more than you chose to be who you are, dad. Just accept me. No I can't. I won't, I won't, I won't. Look, don't ever do that shit again. What? Don't ever go this long without calling me, man. Yes sir, Greg, sir. Look man, you know I'm sorry, right? I do, but, you know I'm still going to have my reservations about Jay. I don't think that's ever going to change. Hey, look, that's alright. Look, I have my eye on him, I know he's shady. You were right, I, I was stressed, but that's all going to change. OK, so um, how's everything with your pops? I honestly don't know. I mean, it's not going to be easy for him to accept everything about me, but that's just going to have to do for now, just as long as he knows where I stand. So what about Lonnie? You sure are asking a lot of questions. Hey, that's what happens when you go this long without calling me. I turn into Mr. Questions. So, how was the shopping spree with our little princess. Whatever about that, yo. Have you met her cousin Tammie? Leave that girl alone. Hello, boys. Hey, Ms. Amera. Thank you. And look it, you got all dressed up for my party. Give me love. Oh, wait, wait, wait, don't mess me up. You'll mess up my hair, come on let's go. Oh, my people, my people, hey, hi. Thanks for coming. Happy birthday sweetness. Thanks for coming. Oh, you know I wouldn't miss this. And I see the gang is back in full effect. Yeah, and better than ever. Well come on. Oh, and it's good seeing you too, Faybien. But I just want to let you know, your plan didn't work. I didn't have a plan, Jay. I was looking out for my friend. Faybien, wait, come here. You know, you got a good thing going and you actually got some decent people around you. I'm not as bad as you think I am. Whatever Jay. Oh, you think it's easy? You think life is easy? You wake up one day and you realize did I just do what I did? And you know what, too late, because there's no going back. I know life isn't easy, you don't have to do what you do, Jay. I'm not so sure about that. Just a word to the wise, better watch yourself, because they ain't always going to be here. OK. Hey, come on, waiting on you. Now let's party. Hey Lonnie, I called you a few times and even came by your place, but you weren't home. I wanted to say thank you. Thank you for showing me how closed off I was. I didn't want to meet anyone new, let alone fall for someone, but you wouldn't let me stay in my little closet, and even though I kicked and fought along the way, I'm glad you did. You showed me a certain freedom I was denying myself. I wish I could see your face and tell you this in person, but that's my fault because I pushed you away. And if there's anything that I regret, it's that. I'm so sorry for how I acted the last time I saw you. I was horrible to you, I should have never taken my frustrations out on you. I can't put into words what my father's negativity has done to me over the years, but unfortunately, you saw a piece of it. I realize I need to get my life together, but I had to do it on my own, and even through that time alone, I found pieces of myself through Greg and Amera, my father, Jay, believe it or not, and through you. So wherever you are, I hope you find this letter and have happy thoughts of our short time together, because I do. Take care Lonnie. Yours truly, Faybien.
