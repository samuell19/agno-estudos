Hussy. Monster! Hawley Harvey Crippen. You are charged with the wilful murder of Cora Belle Crippen .. On the 1st of February last. Are you guilty or not guilty? Not guilty. Ethel Le Neve. You are charged with being an accessory after the fact .. In the murder of Cora Belle Crippen on the 1st February last. Are you guilty or not guilty? Not guilty. You may be seated. No, I am very sorry, Miss. Come along please. It's not a peepshow. Keep back, please. - Not fair. I wanted all night for a seat. Come along please, Keep moving. You'll read all about it in the newspapers. As an American citizen. Dr Crippen's wife. Known professionally as Belle Elmore. Was not able to obtain much employment in this country. In her capacity as singer and music hall entertainer. Although the couple presented a surface appearance of affection and normality. In fact, the prisoner had ceased to cohabit with his wife for some 3 years. During the exact period. That he had been carrying on an intrigue with a young woman .. Ethel Le Neve. Who had been in his employ for a number of years. As a typist. Thus. An innocent woman. Whose only crime was to stand between this man Crippen. And his illicit ambitions. Became an obstacle which he resolved .. To remove .. To satisfy his own evil ends. A deadly purpose which he carried out as the crown will prove .. By murdering his unfortunate wife. And then. Mutilating and dismembering her body. So as to mask its identity. You will see, gentlemen. That we are dealing with a crime that is so frightful in nature .. As to almost defeat description. An educated medical man. Using his knowledge and skill gained for the succour of the sick. To rid himself of the encumbrance of his legally wedded wife. Which he effected by means so awful .. That nowhere in the history of British jurisprudence .. Is there a case to equal it for horror .. And callous indifference to suffering. The murderous work .. Of a veritable monster in human form. "I'm not a one-man woman and I'll tell you why." "One man ain't enough for me." "I've got a great big heart." "And you can have a part." "But don't think it's yours exclusively." "There's a lot of love in me that I am willing to share." "I'd rather have a lot of arms than just one pair." "So come along and get me if you can." "I'm not a one-man woman." "But I've got to have a one-woman man." Oh, I am exhausted. Don't I get any reward for all this key-bashing? Well, you can talk to me if you like. Well, I am a bit more fundamental than that, love. What are you doing, spying on me? I dropped a shoe. You can't give that to a lodger. There's dust on it. Look. I said do this shoe again. Yes, alright. I'll just get rid of the clean ones first. Doesn't he ever go on strike? - Against what? Even a skivvy gets one day a week off. Oh, it is good for him. It keeps him out of trouble. Does he ever get into any? - You'd be surprised. Come on, now. Let's try it again. Alright. Arthur. Get on with you. I can wait. But not for long. - Hmm. "I'm not a one-man woman." "And I'll tell you why." "One man ain't enough for me." "I've got a great big heart." "And you can have a part." "But don't think it's yours exclusively." "So come along and get me if you can." "I'm not a one-man woman." "But I've got to have a one-woman man." What oh, Doc. - Hello. Don't slam the .. I wish you could prevail on your young man not to slam the front door. He'll break the glass. I wish I could prevail on you to get a move on. The soup is boiling over. I was just going to bank up the fire. - Well, you can do that later. Be careful! Sorry, puss. The cat has got feelings too, you know. Tramping around like a great horse. I assure you I didn't do it on purpose. Well, now where are you going? To wash. Oh, use the sink like everybody else. Ready when you are, Harry. Right. That fellow Marconi has gone and done it I see. Done what? Sent a wireless signal across the Atlantic. Pass that to the doctor will you please. Aren't the others coming down? No, they have both gone out for the day. It says here he thinks we'll all have wireless receivers .. In our houses during the next fifty years. For what purpose? Well, I suppose they'll put out concerts and lectures and things like that. I wonder if they would use me. Why not? It seems a poor sort of entertainment though when you can't who is singing. Where is the bread? Peter. Where is your manners? Pass the bread. A funny looking machine, I must say. Take the kettle off, will you. Oh, yes. Weird. You still at it then, Doc? As you see. Any grub going, do you think? You had better ask Mrs Crippen. Oh, better not ask her now then Doc, eh? Yeah, well. Night, night, doc. I will .. I'll see you in the morning. I think I left a book in here. Pardon me. I am just taking the bottles sup. Thank you. We have just been rehearsing my new number. So I heard. You wouldn't like a cup of tea or anything? No thank you. Goodnight, Doc. Goodnight, Mr Faucet. Do you think he saw? Luckily I heard the latch turning just in time. Your face when he came in. I told you not to mess me about. Oh yes, you were very insistent weren't you. Oh, what the hell. Will he .. will he say anything? He had better not. If he was half a man I wouldn't be messing round with boys like you anyhow. Well, since you are .. Who is it? Oh, It's you. Belle. - There is a draught. Belle, I am going to have to ask you to get rid of those young men. Oh, you are, are you? We have to take in lodgers. I'm not using my money to run this house for you. I am not criticising them .. or you. It is just that this isn't a home anymore. I didn't know it ever was a home. You were happy here when we first moved in. The house is alright. I realize I am not everything you could wish for in a husband. But our life together isn't all that bad. Maybe not for you. You have everything you need. I doubt if any of your .. Friends have more jewellery or clothes. That's not all a woman needs. We've talked about that so many times. That's right. And all we ever do is talk about it. I've tried to explain. - How do you think it feels for me? Sometimes when I walk down the street I can see men .. Watching me and wanting me, but .. I have to beg you to even touch me. Please don't cry. Am I so repulsive? No, of course it isn't that. Well, what is it then? When was the last time you came to me as a husband of your own free will? When was the last time you kissed me? Let alone made love to me. You say yourself you don't lack for male admirers. But you are my husband. I want my husband to admire me. Look, if you are ill why not say so? At least I would understand that. No. I am not ill. It isn't that. I don't care about the boys. I wouldn't want any other man if you would .. Only treat me like a woman occasionally. You would always want other men. - I wouldn't. I wouldn't! No. Stay with me tonight. Stay with me and I will get rid of them tomorrow. Don't you find me attractive at all? Yes. Of course I do. Oh, Peter. Peter. Shop. A cab is waiting. Well, this is it. The first time I've had the old heave-ho, I must say. I know, but you do understand? Frankly, I'm astonished he put up with it for so long. Poor little devil. You will let us know where you are? - Oh, sure. Where you happy here Harry? The best billet I ever had. And you will write? Of course. Look. The cab is waiting. Alright. You won't think too badly of me, will you? What a question. Look, I must go. Really. Good luck. - Bye-bye, Belle. Was that Mr Faucet? Yes. I would have said goodbye to him. - Well, he said to give you his regards. Well, we'll have to find you some other interests. It's just that I get so lonely here all day by myself. You don't want to go on doing music halls again, do you? But it's so tough in England. Besides, all the agents are crooked. Isn't there some way you could take up with show business again? You like the people and it is your natural environment after all. I suppose I could join the guild or something. Clara is always asking me to. What guild is that? - The Ladies Music Hall Guild. Looking after members who've had a hard time. It is charitable work really. They are all very fine women and .. Come from theatrical circles. It sounds much more your style. Of course, if I .. Wanted to go on the stage again they could help me get some decent dates. Exactly. I will go and see Clara this afternoon. You. Could have them meet here if you like. Oh, what a wonderful idea. Of course I'd need a new dress and a hat. I saw a beautiful one in Brightman's the other day. It was orange taffeta and had puff sleeves and a neck right down to there. Why don't you buy it then? I could get Mrs Thurman to run me up something. Yes. Blue perhaps? I saw a length of blue material in the market that was going for a song. You get whatever you want. Oh Peter, you are kind. I know. I will go up west and see what they have got in the shops. Clara will know. What time is it? Almost ten o'clock. I'll have lunch with Clara first and we can arrange about the meeting too. The kettle is just boiling. I don't think they want any more. Are you sure? The meeting went on so long. They have to be getting home. Do you think it went well? - They certainly liked you. Mrs Sutton is charming, isn't she. She is the most important one really. She thinks you're lovely. If they don't want any more I'd better get back. You don't have to go early? I can't be too late. Paul will be wanting his supper. I have something to tell you. I am writing to Victor tomorrow to see if he can let us have the material. I am sure he will. He is very interested in the guild. Must you really go so early? Afraid so, my dear. It's nearly six already. It was lovely of you to come and thank you again for electing me. Not at all. It is our gain. It is so nice of you to let us meet in your charming house. Goodbye, Belle. - Goodbye. Goodbye, Mrs Clifford. - Goodbye. Goodbye. I shall look forward to seeing much more of you in the future. Oh .. it was wonderful. I told you. But they are so nice. All of them. - Oh, they are alright. Of course we have something in common being in the theatre, and that's a help. What was it you wanted to tell me? What do you think of it? Lovely. I was admiring it all through the meeting. Your husband is really very generous. - Peter? The only things I get from him I have to wring out of him. This was a present. From guess who? - I have no idea. Not Bruce Martin? Yes. And he wrote me the most wonderful letter. It begins: "To my beautiful brown eyes". Here, read that bit. What a thing to say in a letter. He was always like that. He just doesn't care. What if Peter found it? It would do him good to know what normal men think of me. Oh, come on. Peter is a devoted husband. Everyone says so. Yes. But everyone doesn't have to live with him. I'm a woman who needs something a bit more practical than attention. If you get my meaning. But he must be mad to write like this. Well, it's a special letter. The anniversary of the day we met. Now you take my tip and burn it. It is far too dangerous to leave lying about. Well, perhaps you are right. Bruce is what I call a man. If he walked through that door right now you wouldn't see me for dust. I thought it was all finished years ago. Only because he went back to Chicago. But it's possible he may come back here. Or we might go to the States. Then what a celebration there would be. I tell you Clara, no man ever made me feel what old Brucie did. He is marvellous. Mr Martin. Did your relations with Belle Elmore at any time .. Become closer than mere friendship? Absolutely not. When did you last see her? About six years ago, Around .. April 1904. But you have communicated with her since then? Yes, we have exchanged letters. Frequently? She used to write to me 3 or 4 times a year. What kind of letters? Good wishes. You know, that sort of thing. Where do you live now? I beg your pardon? I said where do you live now? I live in Chicago with my wife and child. Was there ever a proposition that Belle Elmore should come out to you? Absolutely not. No such thing. Mr Martin. As you've given up the music hall stage I take it you failed in that profession. Absolutely not. I saw an opportunity to make more money. That's why I'm a real estate agent. I wanted to support my family and .. During Dr Crippen's absence in America in 1899 .. How many times did you see Mrs Crippen? I went to her house occasionally. How often in occasionally? 2 or 3 times a week. At what hour of the day? Sometimes in the afternoons and sometimes in the evening. But always while Dr Crippen was absent? Yes. Did you write often to Mrs Crippen? Not often. On what topics? Friendship. Were you in love with Mrs Crippen? Absolutely not. But you did tell her that you loved her? Well, I .. I wouldn't put it exactly that way. Did you indicate that you loved her? I suppose she might have thought I did. You mean you deliberately misled her? No, I wouldn't put it exactly that way. She meant a great deal to me as far as friendship was concerned, but .. She was a married lady so it had to be an entirely .. Platonic friendship. This is not a theatre. Members of the public will control themselves or the court will be cleared. Mr Martin. Kindly answer this question directly. Were there any improper relations between you and Mrs Crippen at any time? No, no. Absolute not, Milord. Platonic or not, did you ever show your esteem for Mrs Crippen .. In any practical ways? Once in a while I gave her a little present. Nothing extravagant. When was the last such gift? About a year ago. That would be two or three months before her disappearance? Yes. I guess so. What was this gift? - A little brooch thing. An expensive one? Not very. How much would it cost then? About ten pound in your money I guess. And you are telling us .. That five years after having had an entirely platonic friendship .. With a married woman whose husband you had somehow never met. You sent here a gift costing about ten pounds. Yes. I like to be generous with my friends. Do you have many friends Mr Martin? - Oh yes. Lots. No wonder you needed a more remunerative job .. Than your talents could provide from the theatre. You may stand down. I would mind a bit of platonic friendship with him myself. Call Dr David Pepper. Call Dr Pepper. Take the book in your right hand and read the words on the card. I swear by Almighty God. The evidence I give shall be the truth. The whole truth and nothing but the truth. Doctor. I believe you were requested by the police. To inspect some supposedly human remains on a certain date, were you not? On July 14th this year. I went to 39 Hilldrop Crescent with Chief Inspector Dew. In the cellar there I found that part of the floor had been taken up. And I saw what appeared to be a mass of human remains. This is the part I don't like. - Do you want to leave then? Are you mad? Just tell me when he has finished with the gory details. From the lower front portion of the abdomen. There was a mark on it which attracted my attention. And I afterwards examined it with particularity. In your opinion, what was that mark? A scar. A little over four inches in length. Having examined the remains. Is it possible to say that he dissection was done by a skilled person .. or not? Definitely by a skilled person. Would the position of the scar suggest to you a particular type of operation? Yes. It would correspond to an operation in a female person. For the removal of certain organs. Did you form an opinion as to the cause of death? Yes. By treating the organs with the usual processes. I found a mydriatic alkaloid presence. In further tests I found that it corresponded .. To hyoscine hydrobromide. What are the properties of hyoscine, doctor? It is a powerful narcotic, Milord. Have you any knowledge of its medical use? I have heard that it sometimes used .. For pacifying extreme nervous disorders. In certain American hospitals. What is the fatal dose of hyoscine, doctor? Between a quarter and half a grain. And what amount of hyoscine did you find in the remains? From the amount in the organs. There would certainly have been more than half a grain in the entire body. Doctor. Just tell us what affect a fatal dose would have on a human being. It would perhaps produce delirium and excitement at first. And then the patient would become drowsy. And probably die after a few hours. Does hyoscine have a distinguishing taste? It is rather salty and bitter. But it can be administered in something with a pronounced flavour. Like .. Stout beer. Sweetened tea or coffee. No more questions. Taking the remains as a whole it was impossible to determine the sex. That is correct. As to the mark you claim was a scar from the abdomen. What operation in a male person would cause it in that position. The removal of stones from the bladder for one thing. Before you formed the opinion that the mark was a scar .. You had already learned that Mrs Crippen had had an operation. Certainly. On July 15th. Did not you and Dr Marshall at the mortuary .. Examine the remains together for some hours? We did. On that occasion however you did not come to the opinion that it was a scar. I did not see that mark at all on that occasion. Was it not three days later about July the 18th .. That you learned first from the newspapers .. That Mrs Crippen had a scar on her abdomen? I cannot remember when I first heard it. But it was certainly after your first examination on July the 15th. Oh yes. That will be all. Call Emily Jackson. Call Emily Jackson. Hold the book in your right hand and read the words on the card. I swear by Almighty God .. How friendly is she? She is devoted to the girl but she's so confused he may get her to say anything. Now, Mrs Jackson. Miss Le Neve lived in your house for some time, did she not? I was her landlady for nearly two years. What were the relations between you? We were on quite different terms to the ordinary landlady and lodger. From your experience of her did you notice any change in her manner .. At the end of January or the beginning of February. Nineteen hundred and ten. Yes. One day she came home looking very tired and strange. Did she display other symptoms of disquiet? She was greatly agitated. How did this manifest itself? Her whole body was trembling. She looked as though she had some kind of a shock. Did she give any explanation for her appearance? She went straight up to bed. Later on I sat up with her until 2 o'clock in the morning. Did she subsequently explain to you the cause of the shock? She was too ill to go to work the next day. I told her. If she didn't tell me what was troubling her .. she would go out of her mind. What was her reply? She said it was too dreadful to talk about. Too dreadful to talk about. Did she later embroider on that explanation? No. Up until this time she had been living at home with you continually. Yes. Did she remain so? - No. Then she started staying away nights. And when she came back to see you. What was her manner? She was reading. Was she alone? No. Dr Crippen was with her. Did she bring you anything? - Yes. She brought a number of articles of women's clothing. Did she explain where this clothing had come from? Yes. She said it had belonged to Mrs Crippen. Who had gone away. Mrs Jackson. How did Miss Le Neve address you? She called me "mother". Would you say you had a good memory, Mrs Jackson? Not bad. I'm forgetful about some things. Such as dates? Well. I don't pay much attention to time normally. So, when you mention a time or a date. It is largely guesswork. I am afraid so. But when the police interviewed you in July. Six months later than the event you have just described to my learned friend. You naturally tried to fix the date for him. Yes. They were most insistent about that particular date. You already knew from the newspapers that Belle Elmore, Mrs Crippen .. Had not been seen since February the 1st. Yes, I had read that. Will you tell us. Was the strangeness and shock you mentioned .. Confined to the end of January only? No. She started behaving oddly at the beginning of the month. Just after the new year. So we may take it that for the whole of January .. She was miserable and depressed? Yes. Subsequent to the conversation you have described to my learned friend. Did you discover what was really troubling her? Well, she was upset because someone in the office didn't like her. And she was afraid they would turn Dr Crippen against her. Thank you. That will be all. Well, I can't make head nor tail of the doctor's writing again. Now what is that? It's for feet nerve tonic number 4. It could have been Chinese as far as I am concerned. Morning, Miss Curnow. - Morning, doctor. Dr Crippen not in yet? He is calling at the chemist on the way in. I would be obliged if you would type these up for me. Of course. When could they be ready? By lunchtime. Unless you are in a rush. No. That will be alright. Well, you have certainly got what it takes. What do you mean? The way Dr Rogers looks at you I thought he would jump down inside that blouse. It's nice, isn't it. A present? - Hmm. Dr Crippen is very generous. You must give him that. Come on. You don't think it is a secret, do you? I honestly don't know what you are talking about. Oh no? Good morning. Good morning. Anything in the mail? Mostly glowing testimonials .. From old ladies who've recovered from sciatica after using your remedies. Good. Any orders? - Three. Only three? Have you come into money? No. Why? You have an air of secret satisfaction. It is just that a girl likes to be admired. Uhuh. You mean, I have a rival? Who is it? Just a man. Someone you know. Not ..? Rogers? Yes. He came into the office to give me some mail and couldn't take his eyes off me. Miss Curnow thinks he is getting sweet on me. Well. Perhaps I had better leave the field free for a younger man. He is not younger. - He is 46. I am 48. Well I don't care. He looks at least ten years older than you. Aren't you .. jealous though? Raging with it. Hawley. Hmm? When can we see each other? Tomorrow. If you like. Tomorrow? Oh yes. Alright? Wonderful. Are you sure you don't want me to stay? You'd better not. It is after six already. I don't see why I can't stay if I want to. Well, we don't want people talking. People. I hate people. Goodnight then, doctor. Goodnight. Goodnight, Dr Rogers. Goodnight. I am not disturbing you? No, of course not. It is rather a delicate matter really. I would be grateful if you would have a word with your typist about her .. Costume. In what way? She has a tendency to look a bit flash for an office. Low-cut fronts. Too much jewellery. You know. I am afraid I hadn't noticed. It has become markedly worse lately. I have heard several comments. - I am sorry. Just have a word with her, will you doctor. We don't want any scandal. You know what people are. Yes, of course. I will talk to her about it in the morning. Splendid. Splendid. I hate this sordid hotel. I love it. It is the only place that we are ever really alone. Here. Let me help you. Come into the light. I haven't got my glasses. There. I love you. Ethel Le Neve. I love you too, Hawley. Hawley. Now I must go. I don't want to but I must. Can't you tell her you were working late? I hate involving you in lies. And deceit. - I don't care. I don't care about where we meet or how often. Just as long as I can go on seeing you. Every day at the office. And having these times together. Occasionally. If only I could take you out in public just once. Just to show you off. Maybe you will .. one day. I am so proud of you. We don't care about silly old Dr Rogers, do we? A stupid old fool. I could have hit him. You don't think he is right, do you? That I am .. You know. Too flashy? I think you are perfect. You are always so brave. And I know what it must mean to you. Never having any time to ourselves. Always hiding. I am going to make it up to you one day. I don't know how yet. But I am. Don't talk about it. You never do this to her, do you? I don't care about anything. I have told you. We have had separate rooms for three years now. I can take anything. The thought of you .. I'd kill myself if you ever made love to her again. It's you I love. Ethel. The only way I can stand it at night. Is by thinking go of you alone in your room. Being with you there in my mind. You swear you never have anything with her? Not .. even kissing? I told you. I couldn't. That would revolt me. Doesn't she complain? She is not interested in me. She has enough men hanging around. Aiming for her. I hate her. I hate the way she's tormented and humiliated you. Sometimes, I could strangle her. You know what I do at home? When things are difficult. I think about these times. So do I. That way. Nothing she can do touches me. To me .. love making is something .. Very sacred and special. Something you give to the one you love with reverence. Love. She made me feel unclean. She is insatiable. She filled me with such revulsion I could hardly bear to look at her. Let alone .. You are a doctor. Why didn't you dose her with something? It's a sickness when it is like that. Why are you looking at me like that? Because I like to. Good evening, doctor. Good evening. I wasn't sure you would still be open. - You've just caught me. I'm afraid your order won't be ready until tomorrow. No, it wasn't that. I was just wondering whether you happened to have any .. Hyoscine hydrobromide. Hyoscine? That is new to me. We wouldn't have an in stock I am afraid. How soon could you get it for me? In three or four days I would say. - That will be alright. What quantity would you like? I had better have five grains. In tablet form? No, Crystals I should think. - Very good, doctor. Thank you. Goodnight to you. Goodnight. Paul. Thank you. What about me? Pardon me. Aren't you having any, Peter? No thank you. Come on. I hate drinking alone. It's no good, Paul. He hates to drink. In case he does something rash or abandoned like making love to his wife. No-one would believe it, would they. Now here am I, Belle Elmore. A beautiful woman in the prime of life. The toast of London and everywhere else. To my lawfully wedded husband I am as unattractive as a piece of cold mutton. Now, Belle .. Don't you "Now Belle" me. They are our friends and if I want to tell them I will. I'll tell the whole damn world if I want to. Would you like a cigarette, Belle? Why are you so scared, all of you? It is no secret. He just found himself a little whore in the office. Belle. Well, it is true isn't it? Well. Bed time, I think. - No. Sit down, Paul. Don't be so damned British. Clara knows all about it. Don't you, Clara? She knows what I've been through. Why does everyone clam up in this country if you start talking the truth? You embarrass our guests, Belle. I am doing no such thing. They love me and they have got pity for the way you treat me. Clara isn't embarrassed. I know. Nor is Paul. Now, are you? Well, it is just .. Every couple have their differences, Belle. Not the same one we've got, brother. I'll bet. No other woman would put up with it. But no-one! I am sorry about this. I didn't realize she'd had quite so much to drink. Who has had too much to drink? I can drink you under the table any time of the day. Pill peddler. I am sure you can. I am sorry. We really have to be going now. Going? Look, I am just getting in the mood. Anyway, if you don't mind I think I will just pop upstairs. You know where it is? - I should do by this time. We really ought to leave when I come back. I am not feeling too grand. - Yes, dear. Whatever you say. You don't have to run off and spoil the evening .. Just because my little bantam-cock here has his nose out of joint. It's not that, Belle. Paul really hasn't been feeling very well all day. I have something I want to talk about and it is important. Where did Paul go? Upstairs. You mean to tell me you let him go up to that icebox by himself? It's not the first time he's done it. - You heard what Clara said. He's ill. Just a slight chill on the stomach. Well, you take the paraffin heater up to him. It's freezing in there. - No, he'll be alright. Now don't you take his part, Clara. How disgusting. Letting an old man like that go up there on a freezing winter's night. I'm sure Paul would much prefer to look after himself. Where is the brandy? I am sorry. I put it away. Well .. you sneaky little rat. What are you trying to say, that I'm a drunk or something? How do you like that? This monkey keeps a paid trollop in furs and finery at my expense .. And begrudges me a little bit of drink. - Now Belle. You take your hands off me! Don't you touch me. Belle. Weren't you going to tell me something important? Oh. This is something very interesting indeed. Paul. What is it? Nothing. Just feel a bit peculiar. I think I'd better get him home immediately. Would you like me to have a look at it? - No, thanks. It's just my tummy. The usual thing. - I'll get you a cab. Come along, dear. Goodnight, Belle. Peter! Peter! Peter! Didn't you hear me calling you? I could hardly have missed you. Now don't give me any of those smart answers. I suppose you are very proud lousing up my evening. Any lousing up was done quite adequately by yourself. Where are you going? - To bed. No, you're not. Not so fast. I've got a couple of things I want to talk about. We'll talk about them in the morning. - Oh, no we won't. Tomorrow I may not be here. Belle, not again. What do you mean, not again? Who the hell do you think you are talking to? Listen, when I want to talk, you talk. See? Now don't do me any favours. If you've got something to say please say it quickly. I am tired. You are always tired. That is the trouble with you. Belle. Please. Look. I don't like you making a fool of me in front of my friends. I wasn't aware that I had done so. Hiding a bottle like I was a drunk or something. You got it quite wrong as usual. When I entertain my friends I don't like things like that. Those Ardittis are fine people. What do you think they are going to think? You pretending that I am a drunk or something. Are you alright? No thanks to you. Going to go to bed now? Oh yes. Where are you going? It's late. Don't go. That feels nice. How is the head? Leave it there. What is the matter? I couldn't get my breath. Does my breath smell bad or something? No. No, it's not that. What right have you to behave like I disgust you? I am your wife. I have got a right to have you love me. Belle, please. I bet you don't shrivel up when that little tramp kisses you. What do you both do together? Just read poetry? Now listen, I am telling you. Plenty of men find me attractive. I don't doubt it. Any number of men would be happy to have me here like this right now. You stay right here. You have had too much to drink. I'm sober enough to see through you and your little fancy girl. I think I will go down and lock up. No. I want to talk about her. It will be better if I leave right now. - Better for who? Look, I want to talk about her. I am an interested party. We'll talk about it in the morning. - We'll talk about it now! I must have been mad letting you get away with it all these years. Squandering my money on that cheap slut. And making me a laughing stock in front of my friends. Nobody knows about it. Oh, not much they don't. It's been the hot talking spot of the guild for months. I didn't care before but suddenly I care very much. What do you want me to say, Belle? You've got a plain choice. Her or me. Do you always have to dramatize everything? We've got a pretty good life here. Except for .. this side of it. Except? Maybe it's nice for you playing footsie all day at the office but what about me? You haven't done so badly. Let me tell you this though. You choose her, and I'll hound you out of every place you go. You are a lousy doctor at the best of times. So how do you think you'll make out when people see you live with a prostitute? She is not a prostitute. She is worse! She does it for fun. You shut your filthy mouth. You shut your filthy mouth! Well, what do you know? So the little man is really stuck on the girl. You can say what you like about me, Belle. But Ethel is good and pure. And such talk about her is an abomination. She is a cheap, two-timing slut. How dare you talk about cheapness. You lousy overblown .. Why, you disgust her as much as you disgust me. Oh. So I disgust her, do I? No doubt being the little prude that she is .. The thought of you making love to me would shatter her pure little soul then. I am going to leave you, Belle. Now we are getting at it. That fragile little dream of yours would shatter pretty quickly if I told her .. That you'd been coming to my room once a week for the past 3 years, wouldn't it. I am going to leave you. Pretending she is the only one your lilywhite body has touched. Boy, am I going to enjoy this. Belle, if you tell her I will .. You will what? You can't pretend it is flattering but at least it's funny. You are not going to leave me. Or I'll go down to that office so damn quick you won't see me for smoke. And what I tell her will put the kibosh on your buttercups and daisies romance. Tout de suite. Now, I can promise you that. I happen to love Ethel. Very deeply and sincerely, Belle. And she loves me. I never realized it would ever happen to me but it has. And that I am not going to let anything endanger it. No? That's up to you, sport. You keep me happy and I'll forget about our skinny little friend. Wouldn't you divorce me? - No, I would not. You've threatened to often enough. - Yeah. That was then. Now is now. What do you want me to do, Belle? For a start, you can move back in here and for always. No more separate rooms. You are not very attractive but you are my husband and you will lie beside me. I am not going to be made a fool of. Very well. I'd better go downstairs and lock up. Yeah. You do that. And don't be too long, lover boy. And get me some tea. Alright. What are you doing? Just coming. Well, hurry up! You took your time. The kettle wouldn't boil. Three, isn't it? Yes. Was there a quarrel of any sort that you saw or heard during that evening? Not that I saw. No. Did Mrs Crippen seem in good health? - Oh yes. She was quite her usual self. Full of good humour, you mean? Quite remarkably so. Did she seem fond of Dr Crippen? Devoted. She was a very good and loyal wife. What time did you leave that evening? About half past one. Did you see Mrs Crippen again? No. But later, Dr Crippen told you something about her? He said that Belle had suddenly been called to America. To visits a sick relative. And this surprised you? Very much so. Now, do you recall anything he told you on .. March the 23rd? That was the Wednesday before Easter. Yes. He said that he'd had a cable from Belle. She had been taken dangerously ill. He expected to hear any moment that she had gone. Did you hear from him subsequent to that? Yes. I had a telegram the next morning. Saying. "Belle died yesterday at 6 o'clock." "Peter." "Peter"? That was the name by which you knew him? Yes. Now I want to ask you about an occasion .. In 1908. When you were in Mrs Crippen's bedroom when she was undressing. Did you see anything remarkable .. In her appearance? - Yes. She. She was naked under her housecoat. And when it fell open I saw that she had a scar. Here. Did you speak about it? Yes. I said: Belle, does that hurt? But she just smiled and said it didn't. Now, Mrs Arditti. I ask you to cast your mind back to the evening of February 20th this year. Did anything of interest occur on that date? Oh yes. We had our annual ball. For the Guild Benevolent Fund. Was Dr Crippen there? Yes. With Miss Le Neve. Was any comment made about them? A lady came up and .. After she had spoken to me I looked at Miss Le Neve. And saw that she was wearing a brooch. Did it remind you of one that you had seen .. someone else wear? Well, it was very like one worn by Mrs Crippen. Did Mrs Crippen also wear furs? She had two sets of furs. After Mrs Crippen's disappearance. Did you see anyone else wearing a set .. Like hers? Yes. Miss Le Neve. No more questions, Milord. How long did you know Doctor and Mrs Crippen? About 18 months. Would you say that Dr Crippen was a kind-hearted man .. So far as you could see? So far as I could see, yes. Taking the dinner party on Monday, January the 31st. It was a happy party as you said. A pleasant party? - Perfectly. You did not notice anything unusual in Dr Crippen's manner on that evening? Not really. Did you or didn't you? No. He was happy, talking and all that kind of thing? Well. He had a slight difference with Mrs Crippen about something. But apart from that he was his usual self. What caused this difference? Belle thought he should have escorted my husband upstairs. What was Dr Crippen's reaction to that? He didn't say very much at all. It didn't provoke him to anger? No. He was always very calm and controlled. Now, taking the ball on February the 20th. You pressed him to attend, did you not? I asked him if he wanted to go. But I told him the tickets were half a guinea each. That was a place where he knew if he took Miss Le Neve .. He would meet a great many of Mrs Crippen's friends. I suppose so. The piece of jewellery you mentioned was worn openly on the bodice of her dress? Yes. He did not seem in any way uneasy in the presence of his wife's friends? Quite the reverse. He seemed very proud of Miss Le Neve. Showing her off. Just a moment, Chief Inspector. You say Mrs Arditti came to see you at Scotland Yard on the 30th June? Yes, Milord. This was the first time you had heard of the Crippens? Yes, Milord. Did Mrs Arditti explain why she had come to see you? She made a statement in consequence of which I made enquiries .. Between that date and the 8th July. With reference to the disappearance of Mrs Crippen. And on July 8th did you visit a certain address? I went with Sergeant Mitchell. To number 39 Hilldrop crescent. Where I saw Miss Le Neve. I had a conversation with her and then went with her to Albion House .. Where I saw the prisoner Crippen. Later that day, toward evening. I went with Crippen and Miss Le Neve back to number 39 Hilldrop Crescent. Did you have an opportunity of examining the house? Yes. He showed me into every room. And also round the garden. I said to him. "Of course, we shall have to find Mrs Crippen to clear this matter up." And he said: "Yes". "I will do everything I can". "Would an advertisement be any good?" Together we composed an advertisement in Crippen's handwriting. Asking for information about his wife, Belle Elmore. What was done with that advertisement? It remained with Crippen that night. When Sergeant Mitchell and I left the house. I will send it to the American papers tomorrow, Mr Dew. I wouldn't waste any time, doctor. This could be a very serious matter for you. Surely there is no implication that .. I mean, my wife made her intentions very plain to me. Maybe so. But a complaint has been made to the police. So we have obviously got to trace the lady to complete our enquiries. But you must admit that I am not responsible for my wife's movements. In the normal way, of course not. But look at the facts here as we know them. You admit yourself that you are not on normal terms with her. She has many friends but she disappears without contacting any of them. Instead of telling the truth about her departure .. You invent a cock-and-bull story about a mysterious death abroad. At the same time you move another lady into the house. And deck her in your wife's jewels and clothes. As I bought them I rather fancied they belonged to me. Possibly. I am just pointing out how the matter might appear. Then you suspect me of something. I didn't say that. I am just pointing out that with these elements in the case .. We can't be satisfied until we discover where your wife is. I understand, Inspector. I'll see that the advertisement goes in tomorrow. I think that would be the wise thing, sir. Goodnight. You didn't really suspect anything did you? No. Why put the frighteners on him then? What do you expect me to do, give him a medal? Especially as he's behaved like a damned fool involving us in extra routine work. Which won't lead anywhere. That Le Neve is not a bad little filly, that. I wonder. I can't see a rabbit like that polishing off his wife or anyone, for that matter. Sarge, you've seen him all day. I doubt he'd have given you that card if he really had anything to hide. Here. We didn't get his signature on the carbon copy. I'll nip round and get it on Monday. I've had enough of those codfish eyes for one day. We are definitely going to drop it then? When you've tidied up the paperwork .. We are going to file Dr Crippen and forget him. Where do you reckon the wife is then? You saw the picture, didn't you? A healthy-looking cow if ever I saw one. Ah, she's off with some young buck from the theatre if you ask me. Frankly, I don't blame her. Crippen doesn't look as if he ever had an emotion in his life. [ Shovelling noises ] [ Shovelling noises ] [ Shovelling noises. Loud ] Hawley, you frightened me. - What are you doing down here? I'm just getting some coal for the parlour. I don't want you to do that. Well, I just thought .. - I don't like you doing heavy work. Besides, the dust ruins your hands. The way you treat me you would think I was too precious to do any kind of work. You are to me. Here. You go on upstairs. I will bring the bucket in. Alright, darling. But there is no need to treat me like a China doll. I like to. Who is it? Darling. What's the matter? I just couldn't sleep. No. It's more than that. It's something to do with the police, isn't it? Yes. They think I have done some harm to Belle. But that's ridiculous. She is with that man Martin. I know. But how can I prove it? She will see your advertisement. - You don't know Belle. She hates me. She'll realise what it means. And deliberately not answer it just to get me into trouble. We'll find her. We'll get someone in America to go and see her. That would convince the police. No. It is no use. By that time they will have arrested me. They can't arrest you for nothing. They can hold me while they look for Belle. Even if they do it can only be for a short time. Until they discover the truth. I am a doctor. The scandal would ruin me. Are you sure there is nothing else worrying you? You don't know what lengths she will go to, to hurt me and get her own back. She'd even disappear in American if she feels it will get me into worse trouble. I want to leave here. I want to take you with me. I would go anywhere with you. We will go tomorrow. Where to? The continent first, and then the States. That is marvellous. First thing in the morning I'll go and say goodbye to Mrs Jackson. No. If we are going to go, let's just walk out and sever all ties. Alright. If you think so. I know you think I am overdoing it but I don't trust these police. The sooner we are on our way and with the least fuss the better. What a lucky thing I bought that grey dress last week. I can travel in that and I think I will wear that flame hat. If we're going to go like this we don't want to leave any trails behind us. A middle-aged man and .. A young girl. Will be signposted wherever they go. You want us to travel separately? No. But I think we should disguise ourselves. Until we are clear away from England. That way, even if the police .. Or Belle. Do try to find us they won't be able to. What a wonderful father Mr Robinson is. He never leaves his son's side. The boy seems to look a bit effeminate to me. Let's sit over there, Tom. What can I get you sir? Thank you. My son will have a glass of milk. I will take a sherry. - Very good, sir. Why can't I have something more interesting than milk? Because you are only a little boy. I always forget to put a handkerchief in these wretched pockets. Here. Have mine. - No thank you, darling. I want to go back to the cabin anyway. - Don't be long. Good day, Mr Robinson. Mr Robinson. Sorry Captain. I didn't hear you. I hope you are enjoying your trip. Yes. Thank you very much. I must congratulate you on the ship. She is most comfortable. Do you mind if I join you? No. Please. Please. May I offer you some refreshment? - No. Thank you very much. I wondered if you and your son would join my table again for dinner tonight. That is most cordial of you. A good-looking boy, your son. We're all quite taken with him. Yes, he is always very popular. Enjoying himself at sea, do you think? Oh yes, indeed. Now that it is calm. He wasn't too happy the first few days out from Antwerp. But then neither was I. He seems to have got his sea legs now alright. We ought to recruit him for the line. Lady passengers always like having a handsome young cadet about the place. Yes .. I expect they do. As a matter of fact I've got a son just about his age .. That I've been trying to pressgang aboard but he won't have it. He is absolutely crazy about motor cars and won't hear of anything else. Has your boy made up his mind about what he wants to be yet? No. Not exactly, but .. There is still plenty of time. I expect you will want to take him into the family business like most fathers. Engineering, isn't it? Yes, it's in that line. Oh, Tom. The Captain here has been telling me about his son. Are you fond of games, young Tom? I quite enjoy them. Some of the young gentlemen aboard play a game of deck-hockey before breakfast. Just shorts and a singlet. Why don't you join them? Actually, Tom hasn't been feeling too well lately. That is really why I brought him on this trip. I am sorry to hear that. I thought he looked a bit pale. Well. See you this evening then. Yes. Thank you. We are most obliged to you. Do we really have to eat with him? Yes. I am afraid so. It's quite an honour. I wish we needn't. I know. But we .. We have got to keep up some appearances. Andrews, make this to the London office. Yes, sir. "Further to my message." "Convinced beyond doubt." "Crippen and Le Neve aboard travelling disguised as father and son. Stop." "I believe them quite unaware of my suspicions, Stop." "Will keep them under constant surveillance. Stop." "Please advise." Are you sure it's them, sir? - Convinced. How did you get on to them? The English papers I saw in Antwerp. They had their photographs spread all over the front pages. Poor devils. And he may have got away with it. I don't know how they hoped to get away with it disguised as father and son. She has got a very feminine figure for a boy of sixteen. And he can't keep his hands off her even in public. Hawley, we must be more careful. We will be seen. I feel so happy. I don't really care. Are you pleased to be going home, darling? Yes, of course. But .. I have been away from America for so long that .. I am beginning to feel like an English gentleman. You could never be that. Not the way you behave. Hawley. You don't think Belle could ever find us? I mean, if she ever tired of that Martin man. America is a very big place, my darling. We'll find somewhere and .. Start a new life together. Sir. Thank you. A Scotland Yard Inspector will be coming aboard with the pilot. You will meet him and take him to Robinson's cabin. And for heaven's sake be discreet. - Aye-aye, sir. Hawley, I love you. Yes. I love you. I love you. The engines have stopped. Hmm. Oh. There is a cutter coming alongside. It must be the Canadian pilot. Only a few more hours now. Where are we going to go after we land? I thought, maybe out west somewhere. Los Angeles or San Francisco. Six months ago I had made up mind there was no future for us at all. I thought the best I could hope for was .. Seeing you once a week in that dreadful hotel. I thought you liked it. Uh. It made me vomit. All those people looking at us and knowing and sneering. My poor darling. It won't be long now anyway. I wonder how long it will take for my hair to grow. A few weeks I expect. Thank you. For what? For being Ethel. For giving me the only .. Real happiness I've ever had. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Excuse me, sir. Someone would like to have a word with you. I think you know who I am, doctor. You come along with me now, sir. Whatever happens now, darling. Always remember that I loved you with all my soul. Alright, sir. Come along. You'd better come along with me. Prisoners up. Gentlemen. Have you agreed upon your verdict? We have. Do you find the prisoner Crippen .. Guilty or not guilty of wilful murder? We find the prisoner guilty. You find the prisoner guilty. And that is the verdict of you all? - It is. Do you find the prisoner Le Neve guilty or not guilty .. Of being an accessory after the fact in murder? Not guilty. You find the prisoner not guilty. And that is the verdict of you all? - It is. Ethel Le Neve, you are discharged. No! They are all lying! She's alive I tell you. She is alive. He didn't do it. He didn't do it! She's alive I tell you. She is alive! They are lying! Prisoner at the bar. You stand convicted of murder. Have you anything to say why the court should not give judgement of death? According to law. Only, that I am innocent. Of murder. Hawley Harvey Crippen. You have been convicted on evidence of a ghastly and wicked crime. I have now to pass upon you the sentence of the court. Which is that you shall be taken to a lawful prison. And from thence to a place of execution. And there be hanged by the neck until you are dead. It's twenty-five past seven, doctor. Yes. Thank you. Mr Harding. Is there anything I can get you, sir? I would like to wash I think. Mrs Crippen always used to say that .. If cleanliness was next to godliness .. I would die an Archbishop. She was wrong, wasn't she. Is there anything else you would like, sir? No. I don't think so. Thank you, Mr Harding. Except. In case I don't get a chance to say this later. I am very grateful to you and your colleagues. For your kindness and courtesy during these past weeks. It can't have been a very pleasant assignment. I am. I am really terribly sorry, doctor. What none of us here can understand .. Alright, Harding. You may wait outside. No, it's alright. Very good, sir. Miss Le Neve sent you this telegram. I am sorry the regulations forced me to open it. Thank you. I am very much obliged to you for letting me read it, Governor. Is there anything I can do for you? Yes. I would like her .. Letters and photographs buried with me. If that is possible. - I will see to that myself. If only I could be sure that they'll give her a chance. I could arrange to visit her myself from time to time if that would be a help. Yes, please. If you can persuade her that she must make an entirely new life for herself. Take a different name. And never, never let anybody know who she really is. Of course. You will like her, Governor. She is .. She is simple and real and direct and honest. The papers try to make her out to be some sort of scarlet woman, but .. The jury weren't fooled. They could tell what she was just by looking at her. You know Crippen, I have never met anyone .. Who has struck me as less likely to commit murder than yourself. Whatever the pressures. But I didn't murder her. Then you still protest your innocence? I killed her alright but it was an accident. Why in heaven's name didn't you say so at the trial or at the appeal? Is what I say to you treated as confidential? Absolutely. I give you my word. Well, I'd like somebody to know the truth. You see. Belle and I had been growing apart. Long before I met Ethel. She wasn't a bad woman really, but coarse and dirty. Love, to her, was a matter of appetite whereas .. To me. Well, I found what I wanted in Ethel. So I planned to give Belle regular sedatives. To calm her down. I remember thinking the night she died. We'd had a particularly dreadful quarrel. She was drunk. I remember thinking then. That I .. I would have liked to kill her. So. I am not entirely innocent. The thought was there. They said they found half a grain of Hyoscine in the body. I am still puzzling over that. I could have sworn I didn't give her more than the regular sedative dose. Anyway, she died. And then I panicked. I realised there would be an inquest. And I didn't think they would believe me because of my relationship with Ethel. So I made up that story about Belle going off with another man. But, when they arrested you why didn't you tell the truth then? Well, by that time there was such a hullabaloo. I was a monster. Worse than Jack the Ripper if you could belie the newspapers. I didn't they would acquit me anyway. Not after what I had done to .. To hide the remains. So, as my life was lost. The most important thing. Was to keep alive the thing I treasured more than anything else in the world. Ethel's love. Her belief in me. She. Still doesn't think I had anything to do with that body. She thinks Belle is alive somewhere. Laughing. She is a very simple .. Lovely girl. l couldn't have borne it if she had turned against me too. I'll do everything I can to see she gets the chance of a new life. You won't mention any of this to her? Nothing that you wouldn't want her to hear. [ Cell door opens ] It's ten minutes to eight, sir. Goodbye then. Goodbye, sir. Sir. It's time. I was just thinking. Mr Harding. In a few minutes it will all be over for me. But for her .. It will go on for the rest of her life. -(- -tg)--
