Stack just collapsed, stack just collapsed. So, we gonna have a lot of casualties. University police, what's your emergency? The bonfire stack just collapsed, there are people trapped in it. Okay, we've got units on the way. From Miss Sharon. Oh, okay. This is Sharon from the university of A&M. Mm hmm. A stack site just fell, bonfire just fell over Stay where you are, an ambulance is - on the way. - Okay. I think there's an estimate thrown out about 30 but you know how accurate those are. Yeah, if you can. Okay, where are you? I am at the bonfire right now and stack just fell. Okay, can you see how many people are injured or anything? I have no idea. Okay, hold on. Oh, please. University Police Department, how may I help you? Many people on fire, everything is stuck. Okay, they're all, everyone over there, okay? Oh my God. It's just them, okay? Okay bye. It's okay. We're sending them right now, okay? No, They are all en route over there right now. Yes sir, what you've got right now is you've got the non-redfox bringing the torches in and they're gonna circle bonfire, one time, circle it again and then throw their torches on bonfire. Coming up behind, is the Aggie band. Yes sir. The heartbeat of A&M right there. Gig 'em Aggies! Texas has always, kinda been the business school and the refined, T sippers that are, they're kind of the upper echelon and we were always treated as just the old farm boys, the Higgs from the sticks and while that's no longer true, they were the giant, we were the slayer and we needed to knock them off the pedestal. Beat the hell out of t.u! Where it started probably it's an all male semi-military school out in the middle of nowhere at the turn of the century and not a lot to do. So, somehow guys threw rubbish in a pile and lit it on fire and thought that was funny. And then that grew, got bigger and bigger, and it's in the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest bonfire ever built. And a lot of people will tell you that that's what drove them to come to A&M as a kid, coming to bonfire, watching that thing burn. We can get close to 100,000 people, at a bonfire. Yeah, everybody's there with dates, parents, grandparents, great grandparents. It's a huge tradition from all over the world, not just Texas. So, it's one of those things that kind of ties us all together as Aggies that we've experienced that. It just burns and burns and burns. And the next day, it's still burning. Now it has fallen, but it's still burning and it will burn for about a week. And you can go over there during the day in between classes and sit there, and sing songs or talk about your friendships and whatnot and watch the bonfire burn for about a week. Tells us what you think about the born fire process. Someone would donate a part of their forest land that they wanted cleared and that would become our cutting area. And it changes from year to year. But we would literally go cut large trees down and then we would cut the branches off you would stack these literally tree trunks on the back of flat beds. So, they would build that first stack with logs around the center pole in the ground and wire them together. Then they would level the top, so you could then get up on top of that and begin the second stack, flatten that out and you get up there and start the third and sometimes the fourth stack. And so the higher you went, the more dangerous it obviously became. I was the first Aggie in my family, my original career choice was biomedical science to go be pre-vet. And so A&M was one of the best schools in the country to do that. So, it just seemed like a natural fit. (camera shuttering When did you first hear about the bonfire? When I moved into the dorm. So you never even knew about it before. So, I never even knew about it, I'd never seen it even on TV. Let's talk a little bit about the history of this event. This is actually celebrating 80 years. 1909, was the first year there was a bonfire. 1963, there was none in honor of the, I guess in remembrance, actually of a President Kennedy who had been assassinated just not too long before. But its been a tradition that started trash fire basically, and now is quite an engineering feat. That's correct. It did start with a trash fire. When I got to 1936, it was the first time that they actually use logs and they have used logs for it ever since. They put a center pole there, which is like a telephone pole spliced together to give you that 55 feet height. It's quite a feat to get all of this done. The students got to go to class, and got to do all this the same, right? You make sure everybody gets the right amount of time in class, the right amount of time on the bonfire, right. Class has a very high priority and so, it's important for the students to balance their time and they do a good job of that. The Texas Aggie bonfire is limited in heights now to 55 feet. It grew to 109 feet at one time, several years ago and someone got the idea that maybe we were going to burn the city down. And so they limited to 55 feet, which still makes it the largest college bonfire in the country. And of course, the hundred nine feet, laid the beginners Book of World Records, has been the largest bonfire ever. People on the bonfire, they're throwing the torches on the fire. And its rising, you can see at the top of the bonfire, there's is a little house. That is outhouses, correct? It's referred to as the TU, T And it's the band's, so far, responsibility to put the house up there. For many years, we had to go out and acquire outhouses, but in modern times, they're not any outhouses to acquire if you can translate that. That's true. So, we've had to build our own house. I think its going up in a hurry. Yes, and look at all those flash bulbs going off. It's a great burn. They all said that this will feel. And when you get to set up to go up like that. Remember when you were in school about bonfire bonfire? Oh yes, everybody else remembers how the bonfire was. Well, I just love the camaraderie of being out of the cut site and working together and you really get to know your fellow classmates too that come out there and work on it as well. We got some video to show you about this bonfire being built. This is completely voluntary now, with the majority of our students stopped being in the Corps of Cadets, they don't have to come out and do this. They come out because they want to. It's the camaraderie that's involved. It's everybody working together to accomplish something that nobody else could do. What I was saying around here, if it was easy, anybody could do that. And this of course, is the raising of the Center for, it's a rather big event of its. Ooh yes, we have a candidate at the, our confidence says that matches, incidentally we're all upset the University of Texas is not gonna let us bring it over to Memorial Stadium. One of the things I loved about bonfire was not only does it pull together, so many different people in so many different walks of life, but you're working towards a common cause and you're learning things about yourself, about group dynamics. You come out of it a thinking man. I've learned so much from building a born fire. About how many hours per day you spend on it? So we would typically work on it, Saturday, Sunday, we were doing a double cut weekend. But normally just one day of the weekend, we would go out there and cut down the trees needed for it. But the last week of construction, we're out there 24/7. They trade dorms off, so we had that, that I guess was the time slot that our dorm polled, was that night from 12 to six. I had gone out with my dorm we were in the last week of construction. So, it's pretty much 24 hour construction at that point, putting the structure together. And my crew chiefs from my dorm came downstairs and knocked on my door to come out. I had not missed, stack or cut. So, something they really wanted me to come out for. I was actually hesitant to go because I had a couple tests the next day, but they really insisted that I come out and then I could leave early if I needed to. So, I said alright, I'll go out for a few hours and work on it. And then I'll come back and study, pulling in all night, it wasn't a completely new concept to a college student. So, that's what I did. They said when the bell tolls and they say we can get up there, go ahead and climb up as high as you can. And start working on the construction. I got up really higher than anybody else. It's not an easy structure to climb. So, I was at the fourth tier, standing on the structure. The crane brings the logs in and lowers them down to our position and then me and the swing man wire them in. So, we had done that for a couple hours. And my buddy was actually about to got off and said, "Hey, are you coming with me?" And I said, "No, am gonna do a couple more logs and then I'll head down." So I was up on the second level of stack and if you think about stack at the time, like a wedding cake, I was up on the second layer, roughly 4045 feet near. Right at 2:42am, at that time, I found myself looking down to the ground, looking for some friends on the ground, looking down stack and all of a sudden I didn't hear any noise. I saw the ground moving in my brain. Somehow in a split second, put it together that the thing is falling. It's swayed a little bit and then once it started to kind of tip and go, it was going down at that point. The center pole cracked when it snapped, you could just hear this giant boom The bonfire stand just collapsed, and there are people trapped in it. Okay, we've got units on the way. From Miss Sharon. Oh, okay. This is Sharon from the university of A&M. Mm hmm. A stack site just fell over, bonfire just fell over. Stay where you are, an ambulance is - on the way. - Okay. I think there is an estimate thrown out about 30 but you know how accurate those are. Yeah, if you can. Okay, where are you? I am at the bonfire right now, and the stack just fell. Okay, can you see how many people are injured or anything? I have no idea. Okay, hold on. Oh, please. University Police Department, how can I help you? Many people on fire, everything is dark. Okay, they're all, everyone over there, okay? Oh my God. It's just them, okay? Okay bye. It's okay, we are sending them right now, okay? No, They are all en route over there right now. 2:42 a.m, I was at station one in college station asleep. And we got a tone out from the dispatch that we had a medical emergency on campus. About 2:42 a.m, I was actually in my dorm, my radio had gone off saying that stack had collapsed. So, I jumped out of my bed and I ran to my car and got to the scene. Texas A&M University MS unit, had already arrived. We already had medics that were actually on scene during the whole time of a bonfire being built, so, they had already started triage. So, I jumped in with them and began triage. The original call actually came in, as an injured person because dispatch didn't have all the details at the time and they just wanted to get units in route. By the time I got to my vehicle, we had additional information about the severity of it to go ahead and dispatch all the available resources the City Police station had. When it collapsed, it knocked a lot over the a lot of the lighting that was around the scene. That was one of the first things I noticed. So, there's very minimal light. Where we were using flashlights, we're using headlights. I remember a lot of the unit's turn their headlights to where they were shining on bonfire. When we first got there, it was deafening quiet. Even though there was people running around, it was still an eerie presence. I don't know, I've been on a lot of scenes and that was a different one. The Texas A&M University, emergency medical service had already done and performed and excellent triage system. Their initial triage, I would say, set the incident in the right direction. When I arrived, I was met by their triage person, and he explained to me how many they were injured, the severity of it, how many were trapped. Another thing that will stand out is that very early on on the scene, a group of students, I don't know how they did it, but they brought us a list of the possible names of the victims that were that were trapped and deceased. And I think it had 11 people on that list, and it was that accurate. And I think the only one that wasn't on the list was the student that had came back, was not actually a student at the time, he'd came back to work on the bonfire, he'd already graduated. And they were able to get this information very early. I was knocked out, I think for a few seconds. When I opened my eyes and basically got a fistful of dirt, and it was pitch black at that point and I realized that I was underneath everything. I was pretty much completely pinned, a log had turned sideways and was pinning me like literally right at my waist. And then there was a log on top of that, which was running right across my face, and then the logs that I had thrown my arm in between, were also pinned as well. Every part of me was completely pinned except my left hand was free, and my left hand was actually visible to people standing outside of the bonfire. It was like a little small gutter size hole that you could kind of see my hand sticking out from. Did you hear any yelling and screaming? I heard a little bit of yelling. I think that was Just the initial shock of people who were running to the structure trying to find people. There's actually three people around me that didn't survive at all. And I heard nothing from them from the the moment it hit the ground. I found myself facedown in the dirt. The cavity I was in was tight enough to keep me down and not being able to lift and slide my arm and elbow out. Were you in pain during all those four hours? Yeah, so when I was trapped against the ground, I had shattered my femur and there was a log across my elbow. So between my leg injuries, I'd broken both my cheekbones, I'd punctured glass all a long, between all of that my leg probably hurt the most. My elbow hurt, but I think with the logging on it probably the compression helped me not feel some of that pain. But between my face and my leg, I was in pain. How much pain, were you in? Pretty excruciating pain. I couldn't feel anything from the waist down. So my initial thought I was paralyzed there. My right arm was completely smashed between two logs really well, I mean to the point where you can't even pull it loose or try to even imagine getting it loose at that point. And that actually got worse as the night went on 'cause basically you just can't get enough circulation to your arm at that point. It becomes cold and then it just starts, I mean, it goes way past numb almost until like a really painful throbbing, like it's dying. This is the best way I can describe it to people. We got out the walking wounded that we could and then came back to John and that's where I spent the rest of my night, was with John. Starting IV, getting him oxygen tubing. We couldn't get an oxygen mask into him, so we had to cut off the tubing and literally feed the tubing into him. You know, we'd just, every few minutes to check on him, keeping keeping him awake. One of the things I did I reached in and told John is prepare yourself, you're going to be here a long time. We're having to get some of your other friends out first, because the way it's fallen, and he understood that, he accepted that. And again, that was a lot of courage from his point. They got a, 18-wheeler airbag that they used on the log that was on my head because that was the most critical, and they aired the airbag up and got that log off of my face and it was still suspended about right here, in front of my face, but at that point, I can at least turn my head to the side and look, and see the people that were outside of the structure, but only if they literally had their ear at the ground, like I said, it was just a small little gutter hole that you can kind of see me through. There's dead bodies around John, and we knew they were dead bodies around John. He could feel someone to one side of him, and we would tell him try not to reach around there try not to feel that. He wanted us to call his mom, and I actually called his mom on with my cell phone. Dialed her number, woke her up, of course, probably 3:30 or 4 o'clock in the morning and told her, he's alive, get here soon as you can. You have time to pretty much contemplate your whole life at that point when you're trapped in a situation like that. So, I couldn't feel from the waist down. So, I kind of thought I was paralyzed at that point. So, I mean, there's that on your mind where you're thinking, like, how is my life gonna change if I'm completely paralyzed? Then of course, the thoughts of if you don't make it, I was only 19 at the time. So I thought like, well, what have I really accomplished with my life? At this point, I haven't even started college and now you know, this could be the end. Did you think you were going to die that day? I really never had the feeling that, oh my gosh, I'm gonna die. I mean, I think God's hand was on me and I never had that panic. But I certainly didn't know what was above me, didn't know the state of stack above me and didn't know how much it would take to get me out of there. Tim, was probably one of the first people that we saw whenever we got on scene. He had logs all around him. And he was he was kind of twisted in there. He kept telling us to help other people. "Help other people, I'm alright, I'm not hurt." But we knew he was, everybody that talked to him, saw the same thing. We could see where he was injured, knew it was really extensive, but knew we weren't gonna get him out anytime soon neither. And he was pointing down below him in the stack in the logs and saying, "You need to help my buddies below me, they are trapped. "Don't help me, go get them first." He did an amazing job that night on directing people where other people were injured. He knew where people were, he wanted us to help them. There was every kinda noise you can imagine, from screams to wood breaking, to the metal bands popping. I think one side had a little bit more weight than the other. That side leaned forward just for a second or two, and that's what, then it couldn't held itself up and more and it just gave way. We were actually camping out for the game, and since people found out about bonfire, a lot people packed up their tents and went home. They didn't really care too much about the game anymore. Thinking of the friends of mine who passed away and what their families must be going through on this Thanksgiving. It's like pick up sticks, these logs are all intertwined. We could work on one side in that area. But once these logs become interlaced, we have to work with different angle in order to get deeper on certain spot. And one of my neighbors called me at six this morning and asked me if I had talked with my daughter, Carrie. And I said, "No." She wasn't home, paged her, called her cell phone. I got nothing. So, I was pretty hysterical. They weren't having any trouble. It didn't look like it was leaning, it looked completely steady. There were so many elements of bonfire when it collapsed, that they were afraid to move the structure, they're afraid to really do much to it. So I think they worked through and triage as many people as they could, and then they got to me and it was, they felt like it was my turn. So, what they ended up doing was using the airbag. It's a one by one grid or two by two grid that helps inflate and lift and it can lift the back end of a firetruck and they inflated one and it wasn't enough, they piggyback two of them on top of each other, and as soon as that second one started inflate, I knew my elbow was free. And that firefighter army crawled to my feet and literally yelled, he said, "Lift your head, I'm gonna pull you out." and struck me out of there. And he drugged me out. They immediately put me on a blackboard, got me on a stretcher and wheeled me to the ambulance. And I remember being wheeled in the ambulance. I remember the feeling of coming out from under there and it being significantly colder than where I was. And I don't know if it was the wind or just the day, but when I remember getting out of stack and just feeling cold. I think one of the most memorable moments for me, was probably at the six and a half hour mark. Where I was completely exhausted. And I really had nothing left at that point. I figured if I fell asleep, that would be, those would be my last moments. But I didn't want to upset the EMTs or firemen that I was on the verge of like dying. He knew that he was stuck. He knew he was in a bad position, he knew he wasn't going to get out anytime soon. And we would just have to keep on going, keep him alive, keeping talking to us keep him awake. So I waited for him to ask me to give him a thumbs up. And I gave him the thumbs up and then I tried to go to sleep. And for whatever reason, I couldn't fall asleep. And I kinda just say that that was kind of my, my God moment or whatever it was. Something, I felt kinda otherworldly presence and it was there and it stayed with me and prevented me from falling asleep, for I want to say about 15-20 minutes, until I gave up on the notion of trying to die. They were kids that had to grow up that night. They had to grow up in, in a hurry. And then, there was a second I said, all right for some reason I can't fall asleep. I guess I'll just stop trying. It went away. And then within the next minute, he said, "John, give me a thumbs up if you're okay." And I did. Was there one moment, one visual you saw that morning that you will never forget? I think it's when I looked up and I saw the sea of Aggies that were out there just standing in silence around the stack. And that they were there to do whatever they could to support the rescue effort and just be there in support of the injured. It was unbelievable the amount of people that were out there. This was a time, even before you know social media, limited cell phones, even before daybreak, the news had gotten hit spread everywhere. And we needed a lot of tools and they were volunteering tools, wood for shoring, anything you could request, it was brought to the scene no questions asked. It made me realize what a close knit community Bryan-College Station is. After it happened, I felt like I needed to be with the family which would be the whole community of people. And people did a lot of things that they didn't have to do like came out, it was a cold night so a lot of people volunteered and brought gloves, brought blankets, brought water. The students were just lined up, wanting to help so much out of all the memories of the incident. It was that, the Aggie's wanting to get in there and help. I was the funeral director that was called the scene of the bonfire collapse. At 4:35 o'clock in the morning, they dispatched all the funeral homes in the community. They didn't know how many was in there. The phone call was, you bring every body bag you have. My funeral home, stayed from the beginning till the end. That was my job. Each and every time, they called a funeral home personnel after they identified the Aggie, then you took him over to the temporary morgue at the hospital. And twice, I remember two of the students come to me and said, "Why are you here? "You don't need to be here. "You're so disrespectful. "You wish that people were passed away." And it struck me so bad, I almost really didn't know what to say. And I just kind of turned to them. And I said, "I'm sorry, I was called to do a service." And I just walked away. The other thing I will always remember is when the responders made all the helicopters and all the media leave and they were trying to hear if they could hear if any of those Aggies were possibly still alive. And they made everybody go silent, and it was the most silent eeriest sound you've ever heard, because they told in the stack if you can hear us scratch, knock, yell out, do something. And they made, you had to stand in place and not move because even if you move, shoveling your feet, they would have heard that. And did anyone say anything? No, you didn't hear a word. How do you think you survived that? To be honest, I don't know, there was a log on my head and I'm thinking as much momentum as everything had when it came down, I should have been in an immediate death and immediate head injury. My head should have been, I mean, smashed like a grape and I don't know how that didn't happen. I mean, so it's a miracle in that regard. I was constantly asking throughout the night, how much longer and they just kept saying a little bit longer. And he would ask how much longer and we didn't know at that point, but we were trying to tell him, hey, just hold on for another hour. This might have been about seven or eight o'clock in the morning, and they said, well, just a little bit longer. And I wasn't really happy with that response at that point. So I said, "Well, you tell me how much longer "it's gonna be and that's how much longer I'll give you." And they basically kind of hesitated a little bit, and they said, "Well, to be honest, "we've got to get one more guy out before you "so it's probably going to be at least an hour." And I said, "Okay, you've got an hour." It took them about seven and a half hours to get me out. But they got me out and basically got me on a gurney told me to give them a big thumbs up to let everyone know I was okay. And there was this huge outpouring from the crowd of like clapping and cheering, and, which I didn't even realize. I didn't realize there were that many people out there, When he stuck his thumb up, that crowd came alive. They knew he was alive. I was kind of in and out during the ambulance ride. And then they got me on the gurney into the ER and I also remember is watching the lights kind of roll by and roll me straight into the ER, where a surgeon was suited and ready to go, had literally had the mask in his hand right there and said, am sorry, but I have to put you under now to perform emergency surgery. And the only thing I could think to say was if I don't make it tell my family, I love them. And then he hit me with the gas and I was out, and I don't remember anything until right around New Year's when I woke up again. Recapping the tragedy here at College Station authorities do confirm that nine students are dead, two other students remain in the stack, their conditions are unknown, but officials say that their conditions do not look good. Additional equipment has been brought in and more rescuers from San Antonio, Houston and Austin are here to help in this recovery and rescue effort throughout the night. So where were you when the bonfire collapsed? I was going to school at Sam Houston state. I came home and checked my answering machine. My aunt from Florida had left a message saying that John was in an accident. I immediately called my husband who was an Aggie, and we got on the road and came over to Huntsville, the entire time my husband was like, "Why was John on a Stack? "He was a freshman, you just didn't do this." That was the history of bonfire for my husband, is that it was all based on experience. We got to the hospital. And then we were just waiting for him to be brought in. And so, I went in as they were wheeling him in. If you had told me that that was John, I would not have believed you. He was swollen beyond normal limits. He recognized us. But we didn't see him for very long. It was they brought him in and we just sort of walked by the gurney and then we were put into another room to wait until they could give us some more definite decisions and it was an automatic he's going into surgery. He had made the comment that if he didn't make it through the surgery to tell his family that he loved them. They figured it was better to keep him somewhat in a comatose state, because each time they were taking him in and each time they took him in, it was a risk. To try and help the body, they ended up making incisions on his torso and his legs, so that, the swelling didn't split the skin. The muscles were dying, so they had to go in and scrape out all the dead tissue. We were called in three different times that all of the vitals were saying that he wasn't going to make it. A 19 year old kid, this wasn't supposed to happen. All I could say was, you know truly is in God's hands. I asked John, if you have seen the light, go on. Go. I saw, after the third one, and I saw that he was coming, coming back very slowly. I have witnessed, a miracle. Special logging equipment was brought in tonight to speed up the process of removing the logs. Emergency crews watch the effort from a fireproof basket, looking for any more victims. As the crews work to remove the log, thousands of students came to bonfire field to watch in disbelief that something so horrible that happened here. How did you find out about the tragedy? It was that right at the seven o'clock hour. And the today's show was on the first thing that they talked about, student bonfire at Texas A&M collapsed. We didn't have cell phones at that time either. And went to the office of the Petroleum Club and asked the lady if I could use their phones for a long distance call to my house. And my wife was, she was there. By eight o'clock in the morning, she already had a house full of company. Neighbors and friends that were already swarming the house and she said we don't know where Michael is. About every hour I would go back and make another phone call and ask if she knew anything else. "Do you know anything else?" And went on like that, about two o'clock or so, I got a call back from her, she'd called the office there and I went over and answered the phone answered the call and she said, "Best anybody knows, Michael is dead." I said, "Okay, I will be home as soon as I can." At home, it was almost six pm and the house was still full of people. And I said, "Come on. "Have you you packed yet?" "No, I haven't." I said, "We got to go do that right now." One of our closer friends there grabbed her by the arm and said, "Come on, we're going into your room, "we're gonna pack you right now." So, we did that. So we went out to the side. We picked a spot there and just stood and watched and waited, to see if they had found him or what they could tell us about it, which wasn't a whole lot. I just were almost positive he is in there somewhere, nobody has seen him anywhere else today. At that point, they had removed 10 bodies from the stack. I told one of the people there, the officials there at the tamp, when you find him, you come directly to me. I want to know about it right away. I don't care what kind of shape he's in. I said, I want to see him as soon as possible. And so they finally got him out of there. 12:30 or 12:45, the next morning. They sent one of the people from the town over to tell us. "Mr. Jerry Ebanks, we have your son, come see him." And we went in there, and he was lying on the ground, the head upon cushioning and stuff like that. No injuries or anything on his face, which is only thing that was exposed. I was imagining what it might look like and so how is he in this kind of shape, and he's dead. What happened? They said that he suffered a broken neck and a broken back. And it was his death was instantaneous. And so, I got down on my hands and knees, gave him a kiss on the cheek and got up to leave. And the corner was at the entry to the tent. Abd he grabbed my daughter and I by the arm, he said, "You two the bravest people I've ever seen in my life." I said, "Thank you." and went on our way. He was the guy, that could and would do anything. Unbelievably confident, maybe supremely confident in his own ability to do anything. Earning his pilot's license was one of the biggest things he ever really wanted to do and he acquired it, as early as he possibly could. You had to be 17 years old to get a pilots license. And got his on the day after his 17th birthday. This kid could handle anything taught himself how to play the piano, he refereed soccer, he refereed roller hockey, he picked up, he'd do all one of these little cards at the driving range where everybody's trying to knock golf balls out there to hit you. And he worked at restaurants. He was majoring in aerospace engineering. He wanted to go to work at NASA. If you had one last moment with Michael, what would you tell him? Son, you're doing a hell of a job. Just keep it up. I can't imagine what I could tell you to do differently. Or to change what you're doing. A friend of Jamie's called us and said that there had been an accident at bonfire site and that Jamie had been hurt. He didn't give us any details. My husband, who teaches driver's ED, had a very early class that morning. And so he needed to get to school early. I was going to go down, thinking, well, we've got a broken arm, but it it didn't occur to me, that it might be anything more serious than that. On the way to school, my husband was listening to the radio And on the radio, he heard about the collapse. And he knew immediately that it was a lot more serious than what we had heard on the phone. So, we took off for College Station. We said, well, if Jamie was on that stack, that she didn't have her ID with her. She was in her what was called groads, which was the the clothing that they wore to work bonfire. She was in her groad, so if she was unconscious, they would have taken her to the hospital. That doesn't mean that they knew who she was. So we started on a trip, we went to St. Joe's hospital, and I was convinced I tried to tell the nurse if you got someone here, it could be Jamie. It could be our daughter. I was thinking, "She's okay." She may be unconscious. But she's in a pocket somewhere. She's in a pocket with a locked in protected her. I wasn't ready to give it up. When they pulled Jamie's body out, then they came to us and said that she had passed. In the beginning, you cry a lot, all day long. You go to sleep thinking that, "Okay, I've cried every tear that I possibly can cry, "and you wake up the next morning and loW and behold, "you start crying again." She was a person who wanted to serve others. When she stood on the sidelines as a cheerleader in high school, she was always disappointed that people didn't want to cheer with them and cheer for the team. It really disappointed her for the fans to be quiet. And one of the things that she loved about A&M is how involved everyone is. Jamie was always positive about everything. If she was trying out for something or hoping to be picked for something, she will be disappointed but it would last just a short time. She'd be over it and ready to start the next mission, whatever it was. It was as if her life was going to be short and she had a lot to get done. I know where Jamie is. We're Christians. She was Christian. So, I know where she is. And I feel like when we talk when we have anything going on, I think she's a part of it. What would I say to her? We miss you. We sure would like to have you here with us. So many people are so inspired, moved and motivated by your son saying, "Don't worry about me." "Help my buddies first." Yeah. That was town. That's the way he lived his life. He died the way he lived, always putting others before himself. He was always trying to help someone or make them laugh. And in fact, that quote was from one of his friends after he passed away, and it was very true of him. He was always looking out for the underdog. So that was not out of character for him at all. And one of his friends said that he would run you down to give you a hug. He wanted to be an engineer, but he wanted to act on the side in community theater and things like that. He was very interested in things like Greenpeace. He just had it all. I think his friend had it right when he called him a renaissance man. And when he walked on to the Texas A&M campus, he immediately felt that this was the place For him to be. How did you find out about the news? We got a phone call, three, 3:30 something like that in the morning. And that's the kind of phone call that wakes you up in the middle of asleep and you're going, "Something's wrong." One of his fellow co-members and they call each other buddies. One of his buddies in the called us. They told us that he had a broken arm, possibly some other injuries, but he was conscious as he was being transported to the hospital. I immediately got up, got in the shower, and when I came out of the shower, my husband was sitting by the side of the bed just sobbing. And I went, "Honey, it's okay. It's just a broken arm." And he shook his head no, and he barely could get the words out, "In shock, in critical condition, broken hip." And then we just held each other and cried. Had the first responders, not listen to Tim and try to treat him right away, do you think Jim would be alive today? No, it was obvious by what they found in the hospital that that he, he really never had a chance. His internal organs were pretty much crushed and bones were so close that they had done so much damage that when they operated on him, they just closed him back up. They knew they couldn't do much to their best to keep him alive long enough for us to get a chance to tell him goodbye. I was a blood bank supervisor at St. Joseph hospital. When they brought him in, he was crushed from about here down and they knew that that he wouldn't live. But we were told, this guy has requested to be able to see his parents if possible. And that always struck me as a very touching moment. That will stay with you forever. Yes, yes. When you first entered the hospital and you walk into his room, tell me what you saw. He was pretty well out of it. He was under medication and he was wrapped up and he couldn't say anything. He could acknowledge what we said because he had had a tube down his throat. When he was little, I used to do something with him that my mother did with me. And that was kind of a secret way of saying I love you. And she would squeeze my hand three times for I love you. And he started he's kept squeezing my hand three times. He had had received over 80, I think, units of blood. I can't even remember the exact amount now. And we could not see continuing his life just for a few more hours and blood is something that's precious, that the other people needed that had a chance to continue on with their life. So we just said, let's go ahead and let him die and stop the blood transfusions. How have you been able to somehow accept the unacceptable? The good Lord, gives us the capacity to rebound and we just have to take advantage of it, you never forget but life goes on and you either accept it and deal with it and live your life or you wrap yourself up in a ball and die, I guess. And I do think from talking to the EMS folks afterwards, that his actions actually did save other lives. For the fact that he told the first responders, "Help them first" Right. You think that saved their lives? They told us, that they thought it saved some of their lives. I mean, and like I said, from what the doctor has told us, taking him down first would not have saved him. Wouldn't have made a difference. No. The Longhorn Band would like to dedicate this performance today to the 12 Texas A&M students who died in last week's Bonfire tragedy. We will remember them, as long as there is a Texas A&M and the Aggie spirit is alive. And that my friends is for ever. We could get angry and become bitter people, blame God, a lot of people blame God. I do not believe that is the will of God. But I believe that there is a circumstantial will of God, that what can you do under these circumstances and that's why my husband and I left Tennessee, moved to College Station to try to help the students heal from the bonfire accident. Because the whole mood of the entire campus was terrible, it was in the pits. So we came to try to help them to heal from this and had we not tried to follow God's will and all of this and blame God if it wouldn't have been consistent with our son's life, our faith, his faith. It was to try to glean some good at this horrible experience that we had. It's funny I heard some of the students say they knew that John was going to make it because the 12th man had already died. 12 is Texas A&M number, the 13th person was not going to die. A&M is known as Homer the 12th man. Where does that come from? Well, you can go, it comes from basically, there the fans are so passionate that, they were ready to literally put on the pads and come out and support the team. And I think that as I understand the story, he was sitting in the stands and I think he had done maybe some activity with the team prior, but was in civilian clothes and as injuries began to prevail, they brought him in from the stands and he jumped out on the field and the next thing you know he's he's playing for the fighting Texas Aggies and I think that is representative of just the Aggie Pride and you see that today in our culture and DNA is it's a feel like as a person, you have a duty to help others and to always be ready to serve. When he finally was out of the coma, he remembered being in ICU. He knew what had happened. He did not realize how much time had passed. From November 19th until January second or third? Somewhere in there, yeah. You didn't open your eyes? You didn't wake up once? Well, I know the nurses said I would open my eyes and look around and there was a couple times where they could tell I was in pain from like the look on my face. But, I don't remember any of that. There was a couple, harrowing times where they would just basically tell people, "We don't know what to tell you, "just keep the prayers coming "because he may not make it." We were all thinking about John every single day. Every day that he was in the hospital, and he was fighting for his life and trying to recover. If you think about it, John spent more time in the hospital his freshman year than he did in class. There was just this feeling across campus that he was the Aggie spirit and if he could survive this, that we all would survive this tragedy. He was everybody's son, everybody's brother and everybody's friend. What he has done since that day, that moment, is truly profound. It's truly inspirational that he has taken what happened to him and use it to inspire other people. You truly are the ultimate example of guts in humanity and the will to live. Texas A&M, wrote this press release saying that you will pass away. Right. And thank goodness for them that they didn't actually distribute it but they certainly came close. And part of it was there was a there's a really critical night where I was taking on over three bags of blood at the same time. And I was still bleeding out kind of and at that point, I had no clotting factor left. And so they were concerned that really there was no way to stop the bleeding and that I was pretty much going to die. And they told my mom that they said he's more than likely not going to survive the night. So, you know, just go home and rest and pretty much await the phone call and she said that's what she did. She went back to the hotel and kicked off her shoes and just laid in bed and waited for the phone call. And it never came, so, I kept it, as kind of a reminder of how short life could be, really there was nothing on there other than saying that I was born in Richardson and then I was the 13th fatality. So, what exactly at the end, medically, were your injuries? They were pretty extensive. My pelvis was not shattered, but it was definitely flattened out from the log across my waist. I lost movement in my right arm because of lack of blood supply there. My right wrist was crushed and broken, but there was not much they could do at that point. They just kind of put a splint on it and kind of let it heal as is because I had so many other traumas that they were trying to take care of. My skull was fractured, but they couldn't do anything about that. The log of my face kind of went through my lower lip, so they had to do some surgery on the lower lip to kind of fix that up. I know that they said my liver had split from the impact of the fall. And again, they had to let that heal on its own because they were worried that if they went in to do surgery on my liver, I would bleed to death. So and then had to do extensive surgeries on my lower back to remove necrotic tissues. So, I'm kind of missing one of the muscles in my back. I know my kidney stopped at some point. We know my heart stopped at another point, I think I had over 10 doctors. My mom had, used to have a notebook with a list and it was just the whole first page which was lists of doctors' names. The decision to amputate your leg was that no-brainer? See, well, once they got me free, they realized that the left ankle had been crushed, in between some log. They thought that they were gonna be able to save the left leg, but the issue was was that because the ankle was crushed and exposed to really just dirt all the stuff out there all night that it got infected from the bone, they had, basically had just antibiotics running through me constantly. And there was no way to stop that infection. And then as that infection in my left leg set in, and I slowly started to tank, and they basically said, like, we're gonna have to take off his leg for him to survive. When I woke up, I was just really happy to be alive, but I actually didn't realize my leg had been amputated at first. They kept a pillow down on my left leg and I didn't even, it still feels like it's there when you get an amputation. So, you didn't really realize that it been gone. I saw some bandages at my thigh, but I thought those were just regular injuries. So, it was really kind of odd. They even did a bandage change right in front of me. Even when they changed that bandage, I thought I was just looking at the top of my knee. And once I you know, kind of pulled the sheets back, I realized that my leg was gone. And there's nobody in the room at the time. So I mean, I waited for my mom to come back into the room when I asked her just point blank. I said, "Mom, what happened to my leg? How come nobody told me?" She'd said that, well the doctors told me not to tell you anything because it was like crying over spilled milk and not to bring it up. What are you gonna do at that point? It is what it is. You are alive, I am John Comstock class of '03. Just wanted to thank everybody, for all the good letters and medical staff here at the hospital. All the good prayers and support I've been getting from everybody. I really appreciate it. I'm doing pretty good. Ready to get out ICU pretty soon. I'm getting into rehab and get back by the false. DTA spirit live. So you were in the hospital for almost five months? Yes, I had gone from 165 pounds down to 98 pounds. There's just nothing left to me. Your muscles atrophy at that point. So, you have to build your body back up. To come out of the coma and see on the news, this warmest support that he had had around him was just mind boggling. You know, we're just average folks. And he made the comment that I can't even go to the bathroom without everybody knowing it. Everybody seems to know my life and I was thrown into like a celebrity's role, and that's not what we were brought up with. We didn't know that world and so he was an inspiration. You had a moment in the hospital that really motivated you. Yeah, when I was in Dallas there was I just got the electric wheelchair. So it was the first time I was able to really move around on my own. And they got me an electric wheelchair and I came out into the hallway, and there was this guy there. I've later learned his name, but he had third degree burns over 90% of his body. And he had like, no ears, no eyelids, kind of partial lips. They had to keep a little fluid thing to keep fluids in his mouth and he knew who I was. He was my next door neighbor in the rehab hospital. And he looked at me and he said, "Hang in there, John." And that totally changed me because I went back into my room later with my mom and I said, "If I looked like that guy, just shoot me." In fact, he was so injured that he had no hands. His hands were so injured that they amputated both his hands. And he was doing rehab on forearm crutches. And I said, "If I look like that, just go ahead and shoot me." And my mom said, "No, John, you're not serious." And I said, "No, I'm dead serious." And it took me years to really kind of digest what he'd said to me. I never could understand how somebody in such an unfortunate position could offer me words of encouragement. And I think years later, when I finally realized that, I made the decision that when I was in the right spot, I was gonna do the same thing. We just came to put some flowers down, to just let them know and let the families know that we're thinking about them. How did A&M change from all this? I think for those of us who were old enough at the time to remember, I think I built a tighter bond to the community in the school. It impacted me just to see the whole city county hurting. A lot of people came out and just people that probably didn't even know each other, but felt connected, because of the bonfire in Texas A&M and the students. We currently here in the library, I spend as much time as we can. So, maybe that gives us a special feeling as to what some of these families are going through. People would walk up to us that didn't even know us and say, do you need a car while you're here? We can loan you a car. We were offered places to stay. And that's what makes Texas A&M a great university. It is this what they call the Aggie Spirit. What Would you like to tell the entire Aggie community? Well first of all, thanks for all the love and prayers because I don't think I'd be alive today without them. I really believe in the power of prayer and then just all the love and support I've had over the years has been amazing. I was the first Aggie in my family, so me and my mom didn't really know what to expect. We got mail from all over the world. We got some from Egypt and some from Australia and then probably every state in the US there's just Aggies all over this world. I do think it's important for us to be connected to what happened on November 18th, 1999. As a photographer covering the different remembrance ceremonies, it's given me an opportunity to really get to see the Aggie Spirit out close, being so close to the people who gather every year to remember the 12. It's an incredible opportunity to remember those who we lost, and also to learn more about them. The memorial itself is in the shape of the bonfire, there's a marker in the center of it, marking the square the center pole was and so anytime you go to the memorial, you know that you're there where those people were, you're walking around, and you know this is exactly where it happened. By us continuing to talk about it, it keeps our memory alive and I feel like that's our responsibility going forward. I hope that they know that these were 12 bright young kids that had a big future in front of them. And in an instant it was over they were gone and... They were Aggies just that. And they were Aggies like them and it could happen to anybody on any situation life, you got to live your life to the fullest, I knew every day is a blessing. I think that's what Tim Kerlee Jr, would have told you if he was alive today. A-G-G-I-E-S A-G-G-I-E-S How many traditions exactly has A&M have? - A lot. - Yeah. As a matter of fact, there's an old saying that goes if something happens twice a day in A&M, it is tradition. Before every home game we have a midnight Yell Practice, where current students, former students, grandparents, come in at midnight to Texas A&M in the stadium. It's a way to practice the yells, so that during the game, the yell leaders give a signal and the entire student body and a times the entire stadium does the yell, it's loud. Silver taps is big, every month we gather silently on campus to honor the Aggies that died that month, that leads into Aggie muster. So, once a year all over the world, Aggies gather wherever they are to have a roll call. And someone that knows someone that died will say here for them when their name is called as the last roll call for the Aggies that have died during the year. So Aggie muster is huge because it's worldwide the Corps of Cadets in and of itself is a tradition Texas A&M was an all male military school for a long time and right around '69 they begin allowing women in and then eventually they were allowed into the Corps of Cadets. So what do you think all this I'm gonna go as far as saying love. Where did all this passion, this bonding, this unity come from? I think it stems from the military. I think it stems from the wars. We had more people served in World War Two than Academy's. People going off to war and not coming back. During the Vietnam era, a lot of people left early, some came back, some didn't. Some were able to graduate somewhere. So, I think its stems are originally from that camaraderie that my life depends on you and yours depends on me. Revelry, the mascot is a tradition at Texas A&M. So, cadets were coming back from vacation and found a wounded dog on the side of the road, so nursed it back to health and the next morning when the bugle or played revelry, the dog started barking, so they named him the Revelry. Revelry is now the highest ranking cadet on campus. When we see that dog, we stop and we say hi to Mr. Revelry man and it's kept by a trainer who takes that dog to class and wears five diamonds on its, that's the highest ranking cadet on campus. So the bonfire sort of encompasses and symbolizes a lot of that. When you're tying logs together tree trucks and hauling them around Texas, it's a dangerous deal. There have been people die building the bonfire. There's a tradition within the core that freshmen are not allowed to ever think a sophomore for anything. Because of a day when they were loading a log on the back of a flatbed truck and the log rolled off and the sophomore push the freshmen out of the way, and the sophomore was killed. And the freshmen did not have time to thank him. So for that very reason, it's to this day freshmen are not allowed to say thank you to us to a sophomore they can get around it by saying, I appreciate you sir, I appreciate that, they cannot say thank you. Workers began putting up this fence around the bonfire site, securing evidence that may lead to the cause of Thursday's disaster. Investigators with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and police descended on the site searching for clues, pondering just what happened. No one knows what caused the 45 foot tall stack to tumble but one theory lies that the number of students on top of the pile, as many as 70 were on it when disaster struck. Every time I've been there, there's that has been dancing, joking around up there but I think has nothing to do with that, 'cause joking and dancing around is not going to cause a center pole to snap. And despite students who say there was a lot of yelling and screaming going on just before disaster struck, the school denies there was any horseplay. While the investigation is just beginning authorities will examine the bonfire center post to see if it holds any clues why the massive stack collapse killing so many. Who do you blame for this tragedy, John? Who do I blame? It's a student's fault but also A&M's fault. I don't think there's any one soul, particular entity whose fault, we were 18-year old kids who had no sort of engineering background, building something off the word of mouth. But then of course, A&M could have done a lot better job with any sort of oversight. I was told that a freshman shouldn't be that high up there. I do know that a lot of people would say only upperclassmen were supposed to be up on the structure. But our year, my crew chief said to me that night, they said when they say everything's ago to get on it, climb up as high as you can. So, that's what we did. I found out later that I was doing it correctly. And then I was taught correctly but found out that other students weren't. They were stacking logs in the crevices, instead of stacking the logs on top of other logs like they were supposed to. So they put a lot of stress on the wires. And then there was definitely a cable that was supposed to be put on to the bottom of the first tier when construction was done. And that never happened as well. I think if you had to lay blame, it would have to go to the school. Simply because, this was an activity that had been going on for nearly 100 years with no real supervision from the school. That was one of the things what had happened that we had a hard time believing in that, the school, with one of the best engineering programs in the country had no engineering oversight of the bonfire. When you do something for 100 years and there's no major catastrophe, you're not looking for one to happen. As you can see on camera now that is quite a lot of heat coming from that bonfire. And it will scorch your face if you're to close. That's why I could say, we are at a considerable distance I would say we are standing a block away from the bonfire right now and you can feel the heat right now Back we're on the stage and of course you recognize the gentleman in the middle, well all Aggies do that. So, Dr. Bowen, the president of Texas A&M, Don. Well, Dr. Bowen, welcome to Texas Aggie bonfire show. We're gonna have a great night here, I'd like to talk to you about the university support for bonfire. Well, it's really the university and the community. Everybody in as part of Texas seem to come together and make this possible. We get cooperation, as we go out to the sites to collect the logs, we get cooperation for equipment. And of course, the entire student body is involved with it. So, the red pots right on down, it's a big event. Well, you're the class of 58, here at Texas A&M, and the Deputy Corps Commander, tell us about bonfire when you were here. Well, we work very hard, of course, much harder than these young people did. And I am just joking you know that. It was a lot of fun, but I believe that tradition is, has been preserved very well. Two out of the 12 deceased were found with alcohol in their system. That would be one of the issues that nobody gets on that bonfire having had alcohol in their system. I think what leads to some of the accidents is not paying attention to detail like that. Basically what I did on this project was I was called to come out and try to dismantle the bonfire itself piece by piece, log by log. Secondly that they asked me to write the initial report to the university tell them exactly what was my opinion on what happened and what caused the bonfire declined. First off the site there, in my opinion was not a really good site to build a bonfire. There was a cross slope of about 2% on the site. And the bonfire actually collapsed in the direction of the slope. A change quite a bit from when I was there, and I was a freshman in 1970. It was at that time a rule that the university had a lot of people that had grown up on farms, ranches, had done a lot of different jobs and been involved with driving equipment, things such as that. And what I was finding is many of the students were getting in the A&M, there was actually more urban type students, that hadn't had opportunities to get involved with things that were there was possible heavy construction. So, they were actually putting themselves in a position that were dangerous, that I don't think they realized it. And there really wasn't a whole lot of adult supervision over the bonfire. So, it made it a situation worse. Who do you he blamed for this tragedy? Well, personally, I blamed myself. I was, not that I was totally in control of it by any means, but I had been involved in bonfire, tangled bonfire many times, but I had noticed that things have changed. I also feel like the organization that they had it was student run. I blame that in some regards, because they had a case where we had people involved with things that really shouldn't have been involved with what they were doing. There was an incident that occurred in 1994 with the bonfire. Should that have been a red flag? I definitely think it was a red flag. I definitely think it was a red flag, and I don't know why at that point, they didn't really step up the engineering side of it. I mean, I guess I can kind of understand because they wanted it to stay as a student project. And the students really took a lot of pride in it being a solely student project. But at the same time, that definitely should have been an indicator that something could go horribly wrong with this. This looks like it's off to a real good part. Oh, it is off to a good start. You know, we had the bonfire collapse a couple of years ago, and they had to rebuild it very quickly. And then we had a year where it didn't really burn very well because of the dampness and it hadn't been properly fueled. So, this one looks like it's off to a good start, and we're really happy about that. They wanted to have it bigger to burn longer. It was pride that caused the bonfire to fall, wanting it to be the best bonfire ever. She was my sole caretaker for years, she had retired from delta to take care of me throughout all this. And, I spoke to her every single day after the accident even after I went back to A&M. So I got a call. It was a friend of the family, a guy named James, a friend of my mom's and I picked up the phone and asked him what was up somebody who never called me and he said, "Hey, I'm I don't know how to say this. "So I'll just go ahead and say it. "Your mom has had a heart attack. "And she died." I had a moment. And this was maybe a year and a half down the road where I had, couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't take care of myself. I didn't even want to get out of bed in the morning. And I just kind of prayed to God and said, "That's it, I'm done. I quit, I can't do anymore." And, I pretty much went to bed thinking that God, the world had forsaken me. And, that was it for me. And went to bed and woke up the next morning. And when I looked in the mirror, I kind of said to myself for everything you've been through has focusing on all that trauma and pain and suffering and the misery that you've been through, has any of it done any good? And my answer was no, obviously no. And that that was really the moment where my life changed. He was ready to give up. He wasn't doing things at the same rate as everybody else, and I think it's human nature. We compare ourselves to others. He's like, I'm still in college. I said, yeah. I said most people would have given up. I said, just keep taking one class. I think we take it for granted the simplicities that we have been given. And we just get up in the morning and moan and groan about getting dressed to go on the class. And it's a major effort for him. I kept trying to say, John, just, you will get through, you will get through. I made the decision that I was gonna just live a happy life and do the best that I could and figure out how to become independent and do the things that I do now. Every time I've gotten a little bit of an ability back, whether it just be able to transfer from my chair to my bed or every time I would get like a little bit of movement back on my leg or something, those were like something that wouldn't seem like a big deal right, once I finally saw like my fingers start to move a little bit for the first time. Those were always like major, exciting things for me and gave me a lot of hope to kind of continue on. There's always somebody better off and somebody worse off than you. And I realized that complaining about it really doesn't do you any good as life has gotten better and it's not really difficult for me to have to handle stuff because I know I've handled worse. A lot of people said, God has a plan for you. And I really hate hearing that beginning of my accident because I was like, well, what if I just live a normal life? Yeah! Yeah! - Yeah! - Yeah! You got it. And I got it. I think probably know that the Ebanks Jerry used to actually refereeing my soccer games when I was a kid. For me, I guess the other thing is going out and doing my public speaking and telling my story and trying to inspire and help other people. Working full time 40 hour weeks, like everybody and just got married and have a son and a beautiful wife and I'm completely satisfied with that. I'm completely independent, I was living a bachelor life. So, of course that was a big change when I met Michelle and had our son and had a kind of a quick, had to grow up quickly, right, and put on the father hat. It was a good change and made me a better person. Did you know about what happened to him before you met him? No. I mean I had known because my dad's an Aggie. So, I remember what happened that day and everything, but I didn't know of John, who John was until he was like, "Hey, you can actually look up my story and just look me up on the internet." I was like, "What are you talking about." And then I looked up, I said, "Oh, so, are we still on that dinner 'cause I'm hungry." So. He's funny. He's always making me laugh, he's totally crazy. We go well together. Hey. Thank you. - I appreciate it. - You're welcomed. Have a good one. I don't see him as somebody who's suffering or trying to get through something, I guess it's like he's with me, because I don't see that, I don't pay attention to that. It's just, he's John, he's just John. What I am trying to tell you, the one amazing thing about you is that you don't see good or angry, at least today. I mean, here you are. You graduated from A&M. A lot of people would have just said, "I'm out of here." You got your degree in 2010 regulations and banking Thank you. - Congratulations. - I appreciate it. And when you graduated in 2010, I heard you got a standing ovation. I did. I wasn't expecting it because they kind of walked me through about how I was going to go up the ramp and accept my diploma and then just kinda of roll, go back and roll off stage, but it was just amazing to be recognized for it. So, the standing ovation you got when you were taken out of the rubble, to the standing ovation you got when you graduated, it's almost like, like a bridge. Yeah, for sure. Seven and a half hours of being trapped. And but the standing ovation for my diploma that took another 10 years to accomplish that. If you had all the victims families in one room, what would you tell them? Just as parent, I can't imagine losing a child and just deeply apologetic for their loss and just my heart goes out to them. It's fricking, I just can't imagine the loss and the way you feel and just that they're loved and this is a great place and know that they're, I think if the experienced that I had in A&M, was shared by their son or daughter and child then it was an amazing, while their life was cut short, I guarantee they got to live a full life because of their time here. I think this is a great, it's one of the most ferocious cultures, honored culture and I think it's surrounds and focuses on all the foundational things that we really don't celebrate enough today. Tradition, doing the right thing being honorable. And I think to me to be affiliated with that and to be a pole small part of it is something I'll cherish and I think the fact that their children got to, to be a part of that is special. If you had all the victims families in one room, what would you tell them? I don't know. That's about as real as answer as I can get, I really don't know. It hasn't returned in 20 years, it's probably not coming back. But that's a decision that the current administration and current students need to make. And ultimately, anything that happens, we should make sure that disaster and that happened in 1999 never happens again. There's no greater tragedy than a parent losing a child. I was 22 years old. And parents were coming up to me saying you can't let this happen again. I kind of understand that maybe they're not doing out of respect. I like that the students have taken upon themselves to build a bonfire away from campus and kind of just get together and do that rather than it being a school sponsored event. Do you think the bonfire tradition should return to campus? I really do. Because I really feel like it knit the whole student body together and people would come from all over, not even people that had gone to A&M and come in and be a part of it. On the behalf of the football team I will just say a couple words. I would like to thank the Texas fine Aggie Ben. Texas fine Aggie 12th man. Texas my cadet. And also Texas A&M former students. It's sad to think that my granddaughter who's two now will never know bonfire and in fact, most of the students at Texas A&M right now, are too young to remember bonfire. We become the person that our experiences make us. And that's an experience that I think I'm very grateful that I got to have. And I wish my kids could have. Do you think they should bring it back to campus? Yes, sir. I do know, I told everyone who failed that the university would be bringing the bonfire back. You know like when we go to different stadiums, and people get behind their crowd leaves, our crowd never does that, our crowd never booze. It just tells how the spirit of the tough man is so strong and how they're always behind us and I love it. The bonfire had such benefit and value to the university. We had a leadership and a training opportunity that was lost. And now in front with the role of guard viewing party stood St. Peter and his angel staff were choosing bad from good. First to survey the entire team and in terms of an angel swore by job, I do believe I've seen this galla group before. I've seen them fly since way back when and I've always had the grit. I've seen him lose, and I've seen a win, but I've never seen him quit. You think they should bring the bonfire back to campus? I think they should. I think as long as the parents of the 12 are okay with it, and they can find a way to do it safe. Those lessons are invaluable. I'd love to see it come back. We got a little unfinished business. We're going all the way to Austin Thursday night. And this crew right here is going to beat the hell out of TU What is always associated with this players is class. Yeah, that will get you an important point because RC Slocum he shows it and it's not just a show, he really is a class person. He really is. And I think that his coaching staff, the players really follow in his footsteps, so to speak. And that's the type of players that he recruits. There's so many emotions that are positive when I think a bonfire and then there's this one failure point where it ended in tragedy and ended up costing people's lives and that part disturbs you, so it really pulls you in two very different directions and I don't think it should be forgotten. I think it should be remembered. I think it should be talked about. Should they bring it back to campus? I'd love to see it back on campus. I think it can be done safely. And it can be done with supervision. And here's the thing about Texas A&M. It's a great institution. So, why not ask some great institutions to do great things? We can learn from the lessons. And my guess, is most people would love to have bonfire back on campus, but we need to make sure it's done correctly and safely. Would I like to see it continue? Absolutely, it was one of my favorite traditions and really still is to this day, Even after what happened? Even after what happened, yeah. That goes as far as to say I wanna light it. I put so much work into actually building one of that to see it never happened. Even in my lifetime, even on like TV, I never watched one. To actually like, be the guy who like sets that thing on fire. That would be an amazing accomplishment for me. It would be a triumphant moment for me. Like I kind of conquered something, took a lot of work to get back to where I was, you know.
