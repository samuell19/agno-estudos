MORITZ, DEAR MORITZ This is going to cost me half of my inheritance. We have prepared a dignified burial - but you never mentioned the cost. I couldn't expect you not to know the expenses involved for me You mean for me! And you're tactless to take advantage of my unfortunate situation. - Moritz! - We don't have agreed on a price. Let's talk this over reasonably. Listen, a classy body costs you money, lady, so there's not much to talk Then I shall turn the matter over to my attorney. Fine. You turn the matter over to your attorney and I turn the body over to you. - Moritz! - What have you been doing up there? Did you go to see Grandma? Have you done the shopping? I'm going now. It's about time. We're seizing this. You know you can't take it. Bike riding's healthier anyway. I am your aunt, you know. I know. Boy, you really scared me! Are you all right? You really ought to be more careful. Sorry, I just couldn't stop any sooner. You asshole. Say that again. Hi, mom. How nice of you to come home. What did you buy? It was too late. The stores were closed. You had plenty of time. I had an accident. I got hit by a car. You don't have to believe me. Oh, Moritz. Do you have to run into me like that? What are you doing to the boy? What are you doing to him? Making the young master run errands like a servant. Hi, Dad. I have to work all day, don't I? How, Chief. On the warpath again? And he has his homework to do. I know somebody around here who doesn't lift a finger. Maybe you should ask him to give you a hand. You can use your legs if you want to, Mrs. Schuttbohm. Come on. And don't try to steer for Mrs. Jensens's wheelchair, either. One step after another ... Over the other bed there. Fine! See, you can do it. Even a lady has to use her legs sometimes. That's right. - Grandma! - Did you hurt yourself, Grandma? Get me out of here, boy. No school today? I never go to the Bible class. What do your parents say? Mom's at work and dad doesn't care. Your father doesn't care about anything any more. Sometimes I think he wanted the business to go bankrupt. Running a business into the ground in the time he did ... He married into the family, but that's no reason. That business supported our family for 200 years, boy. What a brilliant flop that was. You don't have to talk so loud, Grandma. He might have waited to declare bankruptcy. I can hear you all right. I'm glad, boy. Please don't talk so loud about dad. At least he could have waited until I was dead to go bankrupt. Now I'm sitting here. I can't imagine why your mother picked such a mollycoddle. Probably out of sheer spite. Mom's coming to see you this weekend. I don't think she will, Moritz. Since she's been working she has her migraines on weekends. Have they sold the house yet? - I don't know. And how does your father occupy his time? He writes. What about? Something about ethnology. Ethnology? Why, we lost our colonies sixty years ago ... Aquavit. The elixir of life. Have a taste? What are you doing here, Mr. Reusse? And Mrs. Schottbohm - spirits for children? You know our rules. And to think a lady like you ... Please take your grandmother back to the house immediately. Good-bye, Grandma. Would you bring me a bottle of sleeping pills next time. Please? Good morning. Hey, man ... You can bring your own lunch. Let me recapitulate. Given that line AC is parallel to line B ... D ... We discussed this last time, but we're going to prove it differently. I have to go to the bathroom. All right, go ahead. So here we need an auxiliary line. It's called an auxiliary straight. I need two jawbreakers. Got any money? - Later. Okay, I'll pay now. Area SBD and four times area SA ... Oh, I forgot to draw in the height. It's from point A to point Q. That gives us the area of the triangle at F 3, which equals SC time AQ times one half, or F 4 SD times AQ ... Now for ABC and CD we need the height of these triangles. We've already got DC and AQ. Now we draw in RD. RD plus SB ... No, we've already got that. I mean TB, of course. So, now we can say that since both triangles have the same base ... I'm lost. All I see is lines. Did you say something, Moritz? Please come to the board. Please sum up what I've said. Well, maybe you can compute the areas for me. I can see you haven't been paying enough attention even to figure out these simple areas. His dad can't add, either. What's that supposed to mean? Who, me? I didn't say anything. Maybe your talents lie in other areas, Moritz. Manual labor, for instance. Right, you jerk! This go too? That stays here. Sorry, son. That's my equipment. Your father gave it to you, didn't he? Have you got a deed of gift? No, why? Then it's part of your father's property. It has to go. The bailiff's taking my stereo! Sorry, but I'm afraid I can't do anything about it. Why not? What does it have to do with your going bankrupt? It's too complex to explain. Why didn't you give me a deed of gift? Father's don't usually give their sons deeds of gift. Well, can't you write one for me now? That would be swindling, Moritz. I don't care I just want you to help me! Do you understand this? The Home called. Grandma wants to see you. Later. Does this make any sense to you? - No. - Were you bad in math, too? Well, mathematics wasn't exactly my favorite subject. Why not? No talent for it. That's what I thought, too. It's all that jerk-off teacher's fault. I don't like to hear you use words like that, Moritz. Jerking off is like masturbation - getting your own kicks, right? What does that have to do with math? A lot! All our math teacher does is get his own kicks up there ... Hey, you're supposed to go see your grandmother! Got any money, kid? Or are you too nice for a little fuck? Got some groovy girls in here, boy. Or maybe you rather jack off? Your daddy was here just yesterday ... Will you bring me a bottle of sleeping pills next time? Looking for something? Can I help? Young man ... Are you going to eat this now, Mrs. Schottbohm? I'm asking for the last time. Are you or aren't you? Dammit! I've had about enough of your tricks. Oh, the dirty dog! I'll call the police! Peeping on old woman like that ... That was my grandson. She's so stubborn, but I'm sure she'll listen to you. Here's your grandson. A little late, but we can make an exception. I'm sorry. I'm glad you came at all. I had to do something. Did you get something for me? What I asked you for? No? I was in St. Michael's Church. Are you turning religious? Not exactly ... Why did you go to church, then? Maybe I'll play there. In church? You want to play in church? The people who go to church are only afraid of dying ... Though they say that life after death's nice for Christians. That's why they make dying so hard. If they didn't, everybody would be standing in line at the gate, and there wouldn't be anybody left to pay taxes or work. And when you don't want to eat any more, they force you to. Christians! The Indians had it better. At least they could die when they wanted to. You're home so late again. Where were you this afternoon? Did you see Grandma? And why did the Home call here? Grandma wasn't hungry. Is that why they called? They tried to force it down her throat. Now, wait a minute. Is she feeling bad? I don't know. Don't you even see me? Why do you always run away? Can Indians die when they want? Die when they want? Indians? Wait a second. Driver? No, that's no good. How about Cheyenne? No, it's too specialized. Here - death, infanticide, suicide, patricide - killing your parents. "Sometimes a senile person requests a son to take his life..." You got me wrong. I wanted to know if the Indians were against death. No, of course not. What gives you that idea? Did you do your homework, at least? I asked you if you did your homework. - Yes. - Good night, Moritz. In or out? Why are you disturbing us? I want to join up. Okay, go stand over there. But I can't sing. Is this some kind of a joke? I want to play horn. With the brass instruments? I don't have one free. I brought mine along. Never a dull moment. Hey, you can play that in a night club, but not a church. Listen first. I don't know who sent you, but get out of here. Stop this instant! This is impossible. I think it's nice. You really think so? Just what we need. Hey, are you nuts? What was that again? Nothing over here. Come on. Let's look over there. Man, that was a fantastic idea! A fort out of tires. Yeah, I worked on it the whole day. Man, that idea's so good you could sell it. Let's go get the next bank. Watch where you're going, stupid! Come on out, guys. What's happening, shitface? Get a load of that horn! Come on in. Come on, get the lead out. Look what we dug up. Where'd you get that creep? Picked him up off the street. Hi there, cutie. Can you play that thing? Yes or no? A little. Play something for us. Stop, please. Hey! Play him a couple of bars. That's E-flat. I like A-flat better. Oh, that was E-flat and he likes A-flat better, Mr. Smartass does. Okay, play it. Okay, cut it. Can't you groove it a little? What's groove? Funny. I don't know what E-flat is and you never heard of groove. Let's give him a sample. What happened? She's paralyzed. We're moving her. What are you doing here? This lady's my grandmother. Hey Grandma, you can still move. Whether I can't or don't want to move is one and the same thing. The doctor said my heart was still good for 20 years. So I asked him why a useless object should need a heart. that was still good for 20 years ... Help me, Moritz. I'm dying of hunger. Please don't. Can't even eat in peace. Wait till we get upstairs. We're a respectable family. We don't have much time. Oh... I feel like flying! Where are you? We have to talk about school. Excuse me, please. I'm not hungry. You just don't want to talk about it. No, I've got something else to do. And you'll just say I have to work harder again. Why not? What's wrong with that? He has to work harder and doesn't want to, that's all. That's right up your alley. Aren't you going to sit down? Even if I worked harder I couldn't get this geometry stuff. This airplane flew by the window the other day at school. I thought to myself, "That plane is chock full of mathematics, but that goof up there at the board can't even explain why." I don't know what an airplane has got to do with geometry. Me neither. At least the comparison has nothing to do with sex life. What's that supposed to mean? Tell me, Walter. I can't learn anything without knowing what it's good for. Like you can build airplanes with mathematics. Can I go now? - Yes. - Would you bring me the salt? Isn't it here? Nothing's here any more. Oh, you're tickling me! Take your glasses off! What's keeping you? Where were you? Can't you see? Is that salt? It's sugar. We're not getting anywhere. Can you change what they teach us? Can I go now? You just don't want to understand. That's exactly what my teacher says. Don't you even know me any more? - Christian! - I'm coming. Oh, sorry. Why did you run away? Watch out for my glasses. How are you feeling? Hey, look at this. I'm going to beat that little bastard black and blue! Wait, calm down. I'll take care of this. You went too far that time. You were asking for that, you little rascal. Good morning. Please get out your homework. What about you, Moritz? I didn't do it. And why not? I didn't understand it. Because you didn't want to understand it, right? If you really want to and give it a little effort, you don't have to be talented. Maybe you're not talented. What? Maybe you're no good at explaining things. Now listen, I don't have to take that from you. You little dunce. Nobody understands anything here! Cut it out, man. You all need tutors. Shut up, you phony! He doesn't care what the class is doing when he's up there mumbling! He must think he's God or something. Okay, that's enough, man. You're the biggest chicken, fatso! Finish your discussion and call me when you're finished. He's going to the principal. I'm not risking my grades because a spastic like you freaks out! Don't drag us into this. You're already in the shit, or haven't you noticed? Shut your trap! - Informer! - You're all just too chickens to admit you all need help in math! And you're not getting any help because your dad can't pay for it. Leave my dad out of it, you ... They're looking up my skirt! Get him! Please go back to your seats now. Where are you going, Struckmann? Do you have to make such horrible noise? There's a sleazy character waiting for you downstairs. What kind of people are you going around with, anyway? - You always dress like that? - Just today. You live here by yourself? Yeah, but not much longer. You got servants here? Aren't you going to ask the young man to your room? Sorry. My mom's under stress. Forget it. My dad says, "Even classy dames like fucking games." Hey, that dame is my mother! - Get a load of this. You bastard. Come on. How come you're here? Because of E-flat and A-flat. Give me your hookup. Right on. You got the whole works here? Hey, watch out. It's like Dracula here. I mean, why stow such great equipment in a hole like this? I have to. They seized it. Seized it? This is getting worse and worse. - Ugh, a rat! - Why? It's tame. Give me an A. Say, why don't you play in our group? With this thing? It would give us total sound. Hey, I think I see her. - Where? - Down there. - What are you doing? - You'll see. Come on. This is one of her paths. And the next time ... ... it's going to be fatal. You like rats so much? It was a tame rat. And I hate that cat's guts. Come on, let's play. Come on, we wanted to be at the museum already. What brings you here? Do you have to look at art on Sunday, too? Why are you here then? Can we meet someplace? Tomorrow at six at the ferry. What's the matter? - Nothing. - If it ain't the music man. What's he doing here? What's been keeping you? Church? Or did your grandma kick the bucket? Bug off, you bother me. Get it off. We need his sax for the concert. Hell, we don't need no pissass pretty boy from downtown. Hey stays here. His horn's gonna give us the total sound. His horn maybe, but him? See that poster? Well, he's on it. And he's a buddy. So you started kissing rich people's ass, huh? He goes, man. Come on, let's move. Get your thing out of the case, man. Come on. He's failing school so he decides to go slumming a little. Moritz Struckmann, tenor sax, in concert. This'll be a concert they won't forget. Tenor sax, tenor sax, tenor sax ... Did you see your Grandma? Today's Sunday. You were going to ... Don't run off again. Oh, my God, Moritz! Leave me alone. Go away! How, Indian Chief. Who is it? Moritz? What should we do now? Oh, I don't know. Away from here. Where do you live? Want to go to my place? Hey, I just wanted to know where. Do you really want to know? I wouldn't ask if I didn't. Up there. Up there? You really live up there? Yeah. Maybe my dad's looking out the window right now. It's all right. You got a boyfriend? Why do you ask? I mean that guy at the art museum? He's my father. What about him? Oh, nothing. Know something? I think your scarf's putrid. - How old are you? - Fifteen. - Only? - Why only? - You're really too young. - What for? - For me. - How old are you? - 15, going on 16. - So am I. You coming or not? Coming to our concert Sunday? I don't know. But you're my girlfriend. Maybe, maybe not. But you kissed me. So what? Wait outside a minute, please. You can come in now. Did you bring me something today, Moritz? Do you always have to ... I saw something and I thought it was another dream first. What happened? I think death is only bad for the living. What did you say? Death is only bad for the living. How do you mean that. Where are you going? Are you going to stay with me a little while, Moritz? Tell me, Moritz, are those the only threads you got? His threads make it. Come on. Give me a C. Shut up, everybody. Here goes. Hey, you know those guys. They're from my class. - Boxer! - Well, don't you want to continue?
