Thanks. So, there's this guy in my building... No. Can I at least tell you about him? Mm, is this peppermint? - Yes. - Great! He's a fireman... Uh, "yes" to the peppermint, "no, thank you" to the date. He's really cute and he has a dog. Well, then you should date him. But you're my best friend, and it's the season of giving! Come on, Melanie. What have you got to lose? Okay. Great! Because I already gave him your number. What? Morning! Good morning. Did you have a good weekend? I did. Oh, they lit up the Christmas tree in Cummings Park last night. Did you see it? I did not. You really should. It is so special. They use, like 40,000 lights. I'll keep that in mind. Oh, hey, uh, Donovan? Good luck today. Thank you. Should've been yours. Hmm? The Evergreen Mobile Christmas pitch. Well, Mr. Farnsworth gave it to Donovan. What was I supposed to do? Fight him for it? Yes! Earnest and heartwarming... That's your wheelhouse. I don't own Christmas. You didn't want a crack at it? Well, maybe a little. You know what your problem is? No. You're too nice. Okay, there is no such thing as "too nice". Sure there is. You stayed quiet while someone else bid on an account you were perfect for, and you agreed to a blind date you never wanted to go on. That you set me up on! And you caved, like always. Too nice. Okay, you know what? You're way off-base. - Okay. - Hey, Melanie The photographer from the ketchup campaign's on the phone. He needs to bump Friday's shoot again. - Scheduling conflict. - What? He told me he was available this time. Well, he seems pretty firm, but I could try to push back? Uh, well, no, don't do that. Um... do you know what? Don't worry about it. I'm sure I can move some stuff around. You got it. What? Okay. I'll work on it. Good! But I'm holding you to that blind date. He really is a great guy. All right, everybody! It's that time of year again! Gather around, please, gather around. Now, as you know the Secret Santa gift exchange is a ritual as old as Farnsworth advertising. It was started by my grandfather and has become a time-honored tradition. You folks work hard all year, so it's important to remember what this season is really about. Tracey has a hat! It's got everybody's name in it. She's gonna make her way around, and when she gets to you, grab a slip. I'm gonna pass. Uh, participation is mandatory, Donovan. Absolutely no exceptions. Now, you have three weeks until the Christmas party to really get to know the person that you pick and figure out a thoughtful gift under $50. After all... we are an ad agency, so it's not an exaggeration to say it's your job to figure out what makes a person tick. This is also an intra-office activity, so, for some of you, it'll be a good opportunity to get to know your co-workers in other departments. Fingers crossed you don't draw the mailroom on the first floor! Yeah, right. I hope you embrace this little tradition. It really does make our holiday party extra-special. We're greeted with a big, beautiful vista. The man grabs his Evergreen phone, sweeps the panorama with the phone's camera. Then... the screen goes black. In stark white letters... "Evergreen Mobile... distance... erased." Well, you certainly know our product. That presentation says "sleek, modern." What it doesn't say is "Christmas." Well, I-it might not have come across on the storyboards, but there will be a heavy emphasis on the winter setting... Trees, snow... That still doesn't give me "holiday." Mr. O'Ryan, I mean, all fairness, we're selling cellphones. All year, we have dozens of ads that push our functionality and design. Our annual holiday commercial's an appeal to the heart. Heart? Last year's featured a little girl building a snowman for her baby sister. It was very touching and it really struck a chord. Shared over five million times from our social media accounts. I appreciate your time and effort, but this isn't what we're looking for. Well, this is all excellent feedback. I'm sure, uh, Donovan here's gonna take that direction and really run with it. Of course. I'll be frank. We have multiple agencies tackling this campaign, and I've promised them all a decision by the end of next week. Mr. O'Ryan, I can give you exactly what you want. I just need the chance. Okay. I'll circle back around and check in with you next Thursday, before I make my final choice. What do you think this says? Uh... fire... "firetruck". - Cool! - Yeah. Yeah, I can see that. Next year, I'm getting Zach to write his letter to Santa in colored pencil. The markers always smudge. Hey... Do you think I'm a pushover? No. Are you just saying that to spare my feelings? Really? You're just... nice. Why does everybody keep saying that, like it's a bad thing? It's not. It's just you have this tendency to put everyone else's feelings before your own. And since when is it a crime to be considerate? Melly, you know I love you, and the world could really use a lot more people with your outlook, but there are times when it's okay to just put yourself first. Hmm. Hey, do you have any clue what I could get Zach? Yep. Here. You don't need it? Oh, we have backup. Thanks. Oh! What do you think of this? He's six. Oh, no, not for Zach. For my office Secret Santa. Well, does he like cologne? I don't know. Well, what does he like? I don't know. Wow. You're usually so good at finding the perfect gift. I know, I know, this guy's really tricky, though. He's been at our office for, like, almost a year, and I don't know the first thing about him. I mean, honestly, I have no idea where to start. Well, so, why don't you ask? Because it's "Secret" Santa. So ask... secretly. Hi, Mittens. Okay. Hey, Jude? Um... Do you have my advent calendar? Oh, you mean the cute Santa one? Yes. That one! Nope. Haven't seen it. 'Kay. Let's... Oh! Wait! Never mind. Found it! You're only just decorating now? That is so unlike you. I know, I know. I normally have this place decorated way before Thanksgiving. I'm a little late this time. Anyway, I'm gonna call you later, okay? Bye! Well, that doesn't help us, does it, Mittens? Meow. So Donovan wants a tie for Christmas. You're exchanging gifts now? Oh, no, no, I'm his Secret Santa. Then get him a tie. Well, that's not very thoughtful, is it? So add a card that says "I thought you might like this." I don't think that it works quite like that... Oh, Melanie, I'm sorry to interrupt, but, uh, Farnsworth needs to see you. Oh. Did he say what it was about? No clue. He said just head over right now. Okay. If you need to speak to Mr. Farnsworth, it's gonna have to wait. He asked to see me. Oh, uh, actually, he asked to see me, too. Hi. Come on in, you two. Have a seat. Melanie... you're familiar with the Evergreen Mobile account? Yes. Yes. This is a unique opportunity. Securing this Christmas commercial would mean big things for our agency. Absolutely! Yeah. So I've decided to team you up. I'm sorry... Team us up? That's not really necessary. I have it completely under control. This isn't a punishment, Donovan. Look, I love what you bring to the project. I just think that you and Melanie would complement each other. I'm sure she's busy with all of her projects. She probably doesn't even want to do it. I-I do have a lot on my plate. See? I should go at this alone. Well, I've already made up my mind. So, Melanie, any current assignments I want you to slide on over to Jacqueline. This takes priority. Okay. You start immediately. I got a good feeling about this partnership. It's clever. It's high-energy. It's... ...A little cold. It's winter. Oh, that's not what I meant. Um, Christmas commercials are supposed to evoke a feeling of fun and family and warmth. Have you ever used an Evergreen phone? Because you can't sell what you don't know. Yes. I have. It's not about "fun". It's about the 64-bit quad-core chipset, 40% faster performance, 256 gigabytes of storage, and oleophobic coating. So, what, do you suggest that we put Santa in a business suit and have him order the gifts for the kids online? Yes! I like that! I'm joking. Donovan. Okay... Christmas isn't sleek. It's messy. It's families singing Christmas carols off-key. It's giving your family presents that they didn't even know they wanted. It's... it's magic. The only thing magical about Christmas are the sales numbers. Okay, um... Do you know... I have an idea. Why don't you tell me about your favorite Christmas memory? Last year, I went skiing in Aspen. With your family...? Look, I'd like to focus on the campaign. We only have two weeks left. Yeah, no, no. I-I was just trying to find a starting point. All right, look. We're obviously at an impasse. So... let's split up, mock up some ideas. Independently. Uh, Farnsworth specifically said we should work on it together. And we will! Later. Okay. All right, if you think that it's the best way to do it. Let's reconvene tomorrow. Sure. Yep. Good morning! Morning. Are you ready to reconvene? Yeah, pull up a chair. Yeah. Sure. Ready for your thoughts. I've used the Evergreen phone for over a month now... Yeah. And the video chat is the best aspect. Smooth video, crisp audio. You know what? This past Christmas, my parents couldn't make it out here for Christmas, and my sister and I weren't able to make it back, so we actually video-chatted the entire Christmas dinner, right from cooking the turkey to eating the meal, to unwrapping the presents. - The whole day? - Yeah! Why? Well, because we wanted to be together... Sounds like a hassle to me. Oh, no, no, no. It was totally worth it. That's what Christmas is all about, right? Being with the people you love. No, Christmas is about people spending money they don't have on gifts that people don't want. Okay, you know what I think we need? I think we need some Christmas reconnaissance. So what do you propose we do? Go stake out a mall Santa? Funny, but no. You can't sell what you don't know, right? That's right. So, there's this craft holiday fair, it's just outside of town. I think we could get some really good inspiration from there. And if we don't, we can always get a good cup of hot cocoa. Let's do it! Okay. So... take a look around. What am I looking at? Love. Happiness. Wonder. I think you've been peddling Christmas too long. You're buying into this way too much. I don't peddle Christmas. I celebrate it. If you say so. Isn't that a little cynical? It's realistic. Do you know how many people see the annual Evergreen Christmas commercial? It is off the charts, and we get to reach all of those people with a message of family and generosity and hope. And cellphones. Yes, but just because we're selling phones doesn't mean we can't say something meaningful. Okay? Oh. Okay. Wait. Look at that little girl right there. Do you see how her whole face is lit up with excitement? That's because, right now, she's talking to the Santa Claus, something she's been waiting for all year. That, right there, is what we want to tap into. When people see our campaign, we want them to remember those cherished holiday memories. The thing is, I don't have memories like that. What? Any? Growing up, December was just another month in our house. Well... I'm about to give you a crash course. Come on! Keep up! Right here. Hi! Oh, it's so good to see you, dear! You too, Bea. This is Donovan, my co-worker. Bea makes the best cookies in all of Connecticut. Oh, thank you, dear. You're so sweet. We're actually gonna need a half-dozen of your gingerbread cookies with buttercream icing. Oh, I-I don't eat sugar. At all? Not if I can help it, no. Thank you. Just... indulge me? Please? Christmas spirit is sensory. It's all about seeing the lights, you smell the smells... and you taste the tastes... So? It's okay. These cookies, they have a memory attached to them for me. It reminds me of making gingerbread cookies with my mom and my sister, Jude. We'd always sneak little tastes out of the bowl and my mom would pretend not to notice. You know, that can actually make you sick, right? So when I taste these cookies, I'm reminded of those afternoons, covered in flour... and it makes me happy. Sounds like a nice memory. It is. Can I have another cookie? Hi there. Merry Christmas. You too. What do you think of this? Um, well, who's it for? My Secret Santa. Well... does she wear bracelets? I don't know. Doesn't every woman? Oh, no. No. Women who draw, or type a lot, like myself, we tend to stay clear of bracelets, 'cause they knock on the keyboard, and then some women love to wear necklaces, but others never wear them, that's not even touching on the question of gold versus silver, so. Wow. Okay. This is gonna be a little more complicated than I thought. Or you could tell me who she is and I'll tell you what she likes. Nice try. Are those stars? No, they're snowflakes. My grandmother had a pair just like them. She wore them every Christmas. They're beautiful. Thank you. ♪ ...What fun it is to ride and sing ♪ - ♪ A sleighing song tonight ♪ - No. No. - Oh, yes. - No. - Yes. - No. Come on! ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride ♪ ♪ In one-horse open sleigh Hey! ♪ ♪ Jingle bells Jingle bells ♪ ♪ Jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride ♪ ♪ In one-horse open sleigh ♪ Hey! Hey. It's a start. So? So? So did it help? It was educational. Good! That's good. Uh, this is me. Oh. I've got something for you. Oh, but you didn't have to get me any... It's my market strategy analysis. See if you can have it read by tomorrow. I think it'll really help us focus our direction. Goodnight! But the cook... Yeah. I just don't get it. He's so cynical. I mean, who dislikes Christmas? You do realize you don't have to fix him, you just need to get him a present? Well, it's not about the present. Although Farnsworth takes the gift-giving very seriously. Oh! Bud! Are you done? Are you ready for your big reveal there? - Yeah! - Let's do it! One... Two... Three! That's a good one. High-five! Good job! Okay, so if it's not about the gift, what is it about? It's about creating a heartwarming ad with a person who thinks Christmas is nothing but a marketing scheme. Well, if anyone can sell a person on the magic of Christmas, it's you, little sis. We are... fresh out of ties here at the North Pole. Are you a sports fan? Do you like to read? Why is it important that you give me the right gift? It's my job. I'm your Secret Santa. You know, I'm starting to think that what you really need is some good, old-fashioned holiday cheer. Thank you. We'll see about that, won't we? Good morning. Good morning. You still want to work at the cafe today? Yes. I don't think I can drink another cup of that breakroom coffee. I know what you mean. That stuff should have an octane rating. I'm just gonna grab some files on my desk. I had Steve research the last five years of holiday campaigns with the highest social media impact. Seems important to them. Good thinking. Thanks. So how did you sneak over to my desk without me seeing? I wasn't at your desk today. I know you put that Christmas tree on my desk. What Christmas tree? Melanie... you don't have to pretend. I put it together after the first email. Okay, I'm sorry, you've totally lost me now. Okay, so you're saying that you're not my Secret Santa? Oh, hold on. Is everything okay? Yeah. Yeah. Guess I was wrong. Looks like we're going to be here for a while. Yeah, looks like it. What if we did something with snowmen? You know, one of them ventures out of the front yard and into the big city? They did that two years ago. All right. Add it to the reject pile. It's 7:00 already? Uh, I'm sorry, I've got to go. I have dinner at my sister's. You know, we're listening to our grandmother's Christmas records, and trimming the tree, and... I've lost you, haven't I? At "sister's," yeah. Anyway, I have to go, because, if not, I'll be late, and then I'll never hear the end of it. Okay, well, I'll, um, I'll hold down the fort. You should come. To your family dinner? Sure. Yeah, I mean, we've been at this for hours, and a break might help, and you can't live on coffee forever. I don't think so. A change of scenery might be good for the inspiration. What's for dinner? Yes! Let's pack up. All right. You know you didn't have to bring anything, right? I'm already intruding on a dinner I wasn't invited to, I'm not gonna show up empty-handed. You made it! And you brought a person I've never met! Yes, oh, and he brought wine. Uh, this is Donovan. He's my co-worker. I asked him to tag along. I hope it's not an inconvenience. No! No, of course not. The more, the merrier. Please. Come inside. The guy who dislikes Christmas? Oh, yeah. It's a long story. Can't wait to hear it. So, Zach, are you excited for Santa? Yeah. I've been a really good boy this year. He sure has. Last week, I caught him cleaning out the garage. Wow! You know what, buddy? I don't think you have much to worry about. You're a pretty good kid all year round. Yes, but Santa certainly appreciates the effort. Right. Donovan, how do you and your family celebrate Christmas? Any fun traditions? Uh, no. Not really. Nothing at all? Mm, we're not really close. Oh. Mom? Could I have some mashed potatoes? Sure, sweetie. Do you like it? I do. I made it last year! Well, you did a fantastic job. You can have it. Oh, no, no, no. I can't take this! It's a gift. Thank you. Angel time! Yeah. Oh! You're getting so heavy. Nice work. Okay. So what am I bringing for Christmas? Pecan pie? Mom called dibs on the pie, but we have an opening for cookies. Okay. I can do that. It was nice meeting you, Donovan. Likewise. Thank you again for the lovely dinner. - See you soon. - You're welcome. - Nice to meet you. - Bye, Melly. - Okay. - Okay, take care. - Bye. - Good night. Melly? Yeah, it's a childhood nickname. I like it. It suits you. You've reach voicemail of Andrew Goodwin. He is unable to take your call at this time. Please leave your name and number, and he will return it as soon as possible. Hey, Dad. It's me. Um, I was wondering if you were free next week. I thought maybe we could grab some dinner or something. Let me know. Didn't hurt. He has no idea it's you? No, I set my Secret Santa email to "delayed sending" so that he would get it when we were out together. Oh, smart! I know. One of the new features of the Evergreen cellphone. Oh! When it snows lightly outside and you can imagine that you're in a snow globe. I have a whole collection. I never took Ebenezer Scrooge for the pen-pal type. I know, right? I'm discovering so many things about him that I didn't know. He has a sense of humor! I'm gonna need video evidence for that. It's true. I swear. How can he not guess it's you? I mean, who else would care enough to get an email account just to figure out what her Secret Santa wanted for Christmas? It's a big building. Hey. What're we looking at? Oh! Uh... Nothing. Just the Evergreen phone. Melanie's on the pitch now. Oh. Right! - We'll talk later. - Sure. Bye, hon'. You know Tracey fairly well, don't you? Yeah. Any idea what she might like for Christmas? Sounds like somebody is fishing for a Secret Santa gift. Well, if someone were fishing... In this totally hypothetical situation, I would tell them that she's highly addicted to the peppermint lattes from the cafe across the street. You're the best. What about a story about our military overseas on Christmas? O'Ryan wouldn't want anything too heartbreaking. A Christmas dog. He delivers the paper, then he delivers the slippers, and then he delivers the Evergreen phone. You're not serious, are you? Apparently not. Everything okay? Uh, yeah. No, it's fine. It's just this photographer. He's been giving me the runaround for a few days. We hired him for the ketchup campaign, and he's just been really unreliable. I thought Jacqueline took that account over. Uh, no, she did, she did. She, um... he's just been so difficult, I said that I would handle him. You know, I don't want to saddle her with a headache. I see. What? Oh. Nothing. You obviously want to say something. I just noticed that you have a tendency to... be overly accommodating. So? So I think it'd be good for you to learn how to say no. You won't offend people. They might appreciate your... honesty. Well, that's coming from the expert, so... What expert? You, um, have a tendency to be... Well, not so friendly. That's not true. You've been working with us for almost a year. Why don't you ever go out with us after work? I'm here to do a job, not make friends. Okay, but you can actually do both. So, what? Spend my Friday nights shooting pool? Chit-chatting with Joe from accounting? Joe is actually really nice, and he's got great stories. And anyway, what's so bad about chit-chatting with Joe? He might actually be your Secret Santa. He's not my Secret Santa. Oh, and how do you know that? I just do. All right. Uh, I'm gonna go get a refill. Do you want anything? No. I'm fine. Thanks. Honestly? I think you can be. Don't tell me you're not dying to find out who yours is. I'm not. Why not? Because I have lousy luck with Secret Santa. Last year, it was Bill in accounting. He quit two days before the party. And the year before that, it was Kenny from the mailroom. He just re-gifted his Secret Santa. It was a t-shirt that was three sizes too large and it said "I love mail." And then, the year before, it was, um... Betty the receptionist. She made me two pounds of homemade peanut butter fudge. That doesn't sound so bad. I'm allergic to nuts. Oh. That's a bummer. Anyway, you know what? It's fine. I have always been a bigger fan of giving than receiving anyway. Well, no, look. If anybody deserves a really great gift, it's you. I mean, the holidays obviously mean a lot. To you. From your lips to my Secret Santa's ears, I guess. Melanie? Yeah? Any progress with the photographer? I'm on it. You know what, I've called him five or six times. He's not getting back to me. But I'm gonna try him right now... Uh, um... Um... Do you know what, actually? We're really busy with the Evergreen Mobile pitch. I don't think I have time to keep chasing him down. Oh. I'm sorry. It's okay. Do you know what? Never mind. I can probably... Melanie, listen. If you're busy, you're busy. I'll just get Steve to do it. All right. All right. Hi. Hey! It was supposed to be a surprise. I guess you caught me. I picked up some gingerbread cookies cookies from The North Pole Tree Farm. Have you ever heard of it? I have. Well, they always go fast when I leave them in the breakroom, and you were out of the office, so I saved you one! Thank you. You're welcome. By the way, nice tree. How's the Evergreen pitch coming along? Good. Good, yeah. I think we've got some really strong leads, I'm sure we'll gonna have something very solid to present to you soon. Excellent. I have the utmost faith in you both. Thank you. Before you leave, there's something else I'd like to discuss with you. Okay. James Porter is retiring at the end of the year, which means there's gonna be an opening for Creative Director, and I'd like to promote internally. Is that something you'd be interested in? Yes. Uh, yes, sir. Yes. I would very much like to be intere... I, um... I'm very interested in that! Great. Great. I'm glad to hear it. I think you'd be a great fit for the position. You know, I've been so impressed with your work over the past few years. Thank you. Thank you. I'll be announcing my decision at the Christmas party, so that gives you and Donovan time to make your cases. Donovan? Yeah, he's one of the other candidates we're looking at. Okay. Yeah, we've been writing back and forth for a week. What do you mean? Oh, I took your advice. I set up a fake email account, so I could figure out what he wants for Christmas. Okay, that was not my advice. Well, it was in the spirit of your advice. Anyway, it just sort of snowballed from there. Well, that's... unexpected. So, he doesn't know it's you? Oh, it's complicated. Why's that? Well... in writing, he's sweet and funny, and... then, working on our project together, we disagree on everything, and... Now we're up for the same promotion. Creative Director? You've wanted that forever! Yeah. Well, so how come you're not more excited? No, no. I'm... I am excited. But...? You know, I think it just caught me off-guard. I mean, we were working together, you know? And now, suddenly, he's the competition. Is that all? What else would it be? Are you really gonna make me say it? What? Melly... you like him. Of course, I like him. He's a nice guy. I don't think this has to do with a Secret Santa anymore. You're falling for this guy. That's... not... true. Are you sure? Mr. Farnsworth? Can I speak to you, please? Sure, Donovan. Come on in. Perhaps I misunderstood, but I thought I was a lock on the Creative Director position. You mentioned that to me when I first started at the agency. But I've been hearing that there are multiple candidates. Donovan, I really value your work here at the firm. It's great. Very well-researched. And I continue to bring high-profile clients. Yes, you do. So? So, I'm taking all of that into consideration. Well, what can I do to show you that I'm the one for the job? Donovan, you're very talented, but this isn't a solo sport. We win and lose here as a team. Take Melanie, for example. She makes the effort to get to know the people she's working with, and make herself a part of that team. As a result, people come to her. Is Melanie one of the other candidates? Yes, she is. Look, Donovan, you've got lots of time to show me you can be a team player. Thank you. Don't forget! Meet up tonight at Harbor Point rink. Who's coming? I'm in! Me too. - Carpool? - Yeah, sure. I'd like to come. You mean you're actually gonna come hang out after work? Voluntarily? Sure. Sounds like fun. Since when does he like fun? Wonderful! Okay, everyone. Meet at the rink in an hour. I guess I'll see you there. See you there. You know, I think the last time I went skating was in high school. Really? Yeah, but it's like riding a bike, right? It all comes back to you once you're out there? Totally. You just got to shake off the dust. Okay. So do you think he's really gonna show? Well, he said he'd be here. Why the sudden urge to mingle, I wonder? I may have suggested it. What did you say? I just said that if he took the time to get to know his coworkers, he might discover that he actually likes them. Wait. Did you suggest it, or Secret Santa? Both, I guess. Well... it looks like you two are pretty persuasive. All right. Any final advice before we hit the rink? Um, just go out and have fun. Oh, and don't forget the, uh, toe-pick. Ah. Oh, here he comes. - Act natural. - Hi, ladies. Hi. Mr. Farnsworth. Donovan! Glad you could make it tonight. It's good to see you. Thought I'd give this a whirl. You know, I appreciate the feedback, and the chance to show you that I can change. Oh, no problem, Donovan. I want to make sure that you get every advantage. I appreciate that. You much of a skater? Not even a little. I'll see you out there. Can't wait. Hi, Donovan. Hi, Melanie. Uh, are you just gonna watch, or are you gonna skate? Oh, I'm just taking it all in. Ah. Well, it's been awhile? A long while. As in, never. What? Oh, nothing. Nothing. I just, um... I don't think I've ever seen you this laid-back. Oh, I thought that a suit and a tie might be a little bit formal for the rink. Well, it's really nice to have you here. Yeah, well, trying to open myself up to new opportunities. A friend thought it would be a good idea. Smart friend. Yeah. She is. Hey, Melanie. Was skating as the office activity, was that your idea? Uh, no. No, it wasn't. So do you want to... do you wanna give it a shot? Yeah. Do you need a lesson? Yes. Okay. Hey, Alicia. Hey! That is a lot of work. No kidding! You got some moves. Yeah, I think I found my new sport. Was ice skating your idea? It was. It's one of my favorite things to do at Christmas. Me and my family go every year. Kinda puts us into the holiday spirit. That's great. Anyway... See you back at the office. - Yeah. See ya. - Bye. Is that right? Well, you saw me out there. What are your scores? I am. Well, I've wanted to ask this for a while... ...And my dad... he was never much for holidays. He's a lawyer, very successful. I can't remember a single Christmas he didn't spend in the office. He was disappointed when I turned down law school. I'm sorry. Merry Christmas. Thanks again for offering to take him to the North Pole Tree Farm today. He has been talking about it non-stop. My pleasure. You know what? I think I'm just as excited about it as he is. So how goes the hunt for the perfect Secret Santa gift? Oh, uh, not good. Still haven't figured out what to get him? No, I have no clue. But you spent the last week with the guy. You must have gotten to know him pretty well. He's an early-riser. He does not like sugar in his coffee. He's stubborn, but fair. And he's a horrible skater, but refuses to admit it. Hey, hey! Not so fast with that scarf! - Come here. - But the snowman needs a scarf! No, he's not getting yours. Come here. Aw, but he'll be cold. No, you'll be cold! You know what, Zach? I think green's his color. Thanks, Auntie Mel. Welcome. Melly, it's gonna be in the teens today. Aw... Worth it. Nice! I'm looking for some snowflake-shaped earrings. You had them here the other day. I'm sorry. I sold those this morning. But I can show you something else. We have a lot of very festive jewelry. I had my heart set on those, but, thank you. Oh! Hi. Hi! I didn't expect to see you here, of all places... I had a craving for those gingerbread cookies. I told you so! Auntie Mel! Can I get my picture taken with Santa? Yes, of course, you can. Mr. Donovan, do you want to see him, too? - Oh, no, that's fine, no... - You can tag along. If you want. You can tell him what you want for Christmas! Okay. Okay... I've been really good this year, Santa! Did you get my list? Why not make this a family photo? Everyone squeeze in. - Oh, no... - No, we're not the... Come on, Auntie Mel! Come on, Mr. Donovan! Do you mind? - Sure. - Okay. All right, everybody! Let's say "candy canes!" Candy canes! Can I have some quarters? Oh, sure you can. Uh, do you know what? I think I'm all out of quarters. Oh, wait. I should have some. Oh. Yeah, here. Here you go, Zach. Thanks. You're welcome. Thank you. Okay, wait. Oh, wait. One second. Gotta show you. You gotta hold your hand out flat, like that. 'Cause they're gonna nibble right out of there. Have fun! You're so good with him. Oh, he makes it easy. You cold? Uh, a little. I gave my scarf to a snowman. Do I even need to ask? Nah, probably not. Here. What? Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm totally fine. Don't worry about it. You're shivering. Well... There. Thank you. Yeah. Auntie Mel! Auntie Mel! Yes! Zach. Yeah? Can I make an ornament? Of course you can. Go on! Thank you. Hey, did you know that reindeer are the only mammals that can see ultraviolet light? No. Is that how they lead the sleigh? You know what. I bet it is. Is that true? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I saw it on a nature show. Wow. Yeah. Nice! Go for it. Oh! Hi. What's this? Our pitch. Our pitch? Yeah. When I went home yesterday, it hit me. What does Santa's sleigh need that an Evergreen phone has? I don't know. GPS! I've got the whole script right there, and some mock-ups. Okay. Great. I'm gonna take a look at it right now, and I'll get back to you with notes. No need. Worked on it all night. It is perfect. You don't think I should at least give you some input? There's no time for that. Look, I tell you what. Let me take point, and you can chime in if you feel the need to, but I highly doubt it... I mean, this here? Real winner. I already let Farnsworth know we're coming by. Oh... um... Okay, yeah, I mean, If you really think it's ready. Trust me. He's gonna love it. I don't think this is the one. Sir, we have only three days before we pitch to O'Ryan. I think we should run with it. Sorry. It's not a bad idea, it's just missing something. We only get one shot at this. So, we need... more. More what? More heart. We'll get there. Okay. What are you working on? Secret Santa. Got a few likes, a few dislikes, from him, which is a start, but he's tough. You know, I thought... You know that cafe that he goes to, where he works all the time? Would it be too impersonal to get him a gift card for coffee? Uh, yeah. Okay. Um, what about cookies? He doesn't eat sugar. You know that! I know. What about a membership to the astronomy club? Oh, he's coming! Dad. Donovan! What are you doing in my neck of the woods? I saw I missed your call, so I thought I'd just come by. Are you busy? I'm on my way to the courthouse. How've you been? Good. You know, busy as usual. You, uh, do you have any plans for Christmas? Ah, same as every year. Work. Avoid the crowds by Grand Central. Good time to get caught up and get things done when the office is quiet. Yeah. Yeah... There's something I wanted to ask you... Excuse me. Hello? What do you mean, he's not there? Well, please do your best to track him down. We have his deposition today. I'm sorry. It's been like this all day. It's okay. It's been a pretty busy few weeks at work for me, too. I'm working on a big account. Evergreen Mobile. The CEO has one heck of a poker face, but... when we bring him back in, I think I can sell him on our vision. You always were very persuasive. Your mother used to say that you could sell a red popsicle to a woman with white gloves... ...On the fourth of July. You would have made a fine attorney. I don't think so. Of course, you would have. It's in your blood. Three generations of litigators. Four, now, with your sister. Did she tell you that she's arguing two cases before the California Supreme Court this year? Very influential. No. She didn't mention that. All I'm saying is I think you missed your calling. No. No, Dad. I didn't. I'm sorry I don't have more time. What was it you wanted to ask me? It's not important. I'll see you later, Dad. I knew the pitch was off. I should've insisted on looking it over before we went in there. So why didn't you? Because he got so excited. You know, I didn't want to take the wind out of his sails. Melly... his sails are your sails. You're supposed to be a team, right? Yeah. So why are you sitting on the bench for this one? Was that a sports reference? My husband's influence. Speaking of... Hot chocolate's getting cold. Thank you. Sorry. Bedtime stories ran a little long. Got you to read it twice, did he? Sure did. What did I miss? Oh, just work trouble. That Christmas account still throwing you for a loop? Yeah. You got any advice? I don't know if I can give you any advice, but maybe an early Christmas gift? What? Here you go. Guys! Oh, my goodness. This is amazing. A must-have for a new creative executive. Guys, it's beautiful. But I don't have the promotion. "Yet." Knock 'em dead, Melly. Why don't we save it? I've worked so hard to get where I am. Tsk. Maybe instead of focusing on your differences, you need to find some common ground. What's something you both like to do? I begged her to sign me up for all the dance classes. It had been her dream, and then, suddenly, it was mine. About halfway through my first year at Juilliard... I realized that I just didn't love it. Do you know what she said? She told me that the only thing that she's ever wanted me to be was happy. Thank you. Anytime. On a lighter note... I was wondering if there is any Christmas activity you haven't done? Really? I have a hard time believing that. Meow! Oh! Okay. Okay. I'm feeding you. Okay. So, Donovan wants to meet. You've already met. He wants to meet his Secret Santa. That seems like cheating. The party's still two weeks away. Yeah, but you know what, maybe it's time I tell him. We've gotten really close, and it feels wrong to keep it from him. Okay, so tell him. Yes, I would, it's just... Just what? This is gonna sound really silly, but... What we have behind the screen is really special, and I'm worried that he'll be disappointed. Why would he be disappointed? He obviously likes you. He likes his Secret Santa. And you are his Secret Santa. Yes, but he doesn't know that. I think I've just let it go on for too long. This started out as just a way to get to know him better, and now he's told me all these personal things about himself and his family, and, I mean, how's he gonna react Hi. Hi. Um... Uh, there's something I need to tell you. Uh, I know. You do? Well, it's pretty obvious to me. It is? You're nervous about the pitch. What? But you don't have to be. Oh? I've got a handle on it. Three new ideas they'd be crazy to pass up. I'm about to take them to Farnsworth. No. No? Donovan, this whole time... I've let you take the lead. But, um... I want a say now, I want a real say. You're standing your ground? Yes. I am. This is only going to work if we do it together. Okay. Together. Together. Okay! Um, I brought some magazines for inspiration, they're in that bag over there. Do you mind grabbing them? Sure. What's this? Oh, it's Zach's Christmas present. He's gonna love it. I know. It was at the top of his list. Wait a minute... Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute! That's it! That's it! What's "it"? Our concept. It's perfect. We start on a blizzard. A six-year-old boy looks through the window, watching his father braves the elements as he clears the walkway. He watches, and thinks of ways to help his dad. Suddenly... an idea. He races to his room, he picks up paper and a crayon, and begins to write. But then... He notices the calendar on the wall. All the red "X" s show there's only two days left until Christmas. He looks back down at his letter, realizing it's not gonna get there in time. How's he gonna reach Santa? The A5 Evergreen cellphone. Out of earshot of his parents, he calls the operator, asks for the number to Santa's Workshop. Cut to... Christmas morning. Little boy races towards the biggest gift under the tree He plucks the card from it. It reads... "To Billy's dad, from Santa." Beaming with excitement, he hands the card to his dad. He tears off the paper, revealing a brand-new snowblower. His father laughs, touched, gives his son a hug. And then we cut to your logo, with stylish script above that reads... "From our family to yours..." "...Merry Christmas." I love it. It's exactly right. Great work. I couldn't agree more. Do you think you can have this in production and ready to go for Christmas week? Absolutely. Let's go to my office. We'll discuss the details. Perfect. Nice work. Thank you. What? Come here! Sorry. Sorry. - That's okay. That's okay. - You were incredible! I mean, I can't believe we just did that! Good work, partner. You too, partner. Hey! Hey. Heard about the Evergreen pitch. Congratulations. Thanks. Can I walk you out? Sure. This calls for celebration! Ooh! Hot chocolate on me. Sure, yeah. Oh... you know what? I forgot my phone back at the office. I am just gonna go run get it, but I'll meet you back here. - Sure. - Okay. Hey. Um... I think I must've walked two miles last night, going tree lot to tree lot, but I finally found the perfect one. It's just the right height, it has nice, full branches, and I am babbling. Sorry. I just really love Christmas. I'll admit. It's winning me over. You have plans tonight? No. I am free. Would you maybe want to grab dinner? I'd love to. Great. Thank you. Andrew Goodwin's office. Yeah, hi. I'd like to speak to Andrew, please. This is his son. Donovan. Donovan! It's so nice to finally match a voice to the name. Excuse me? Sorry. It's just I've heard so much about you from Mr. Goodwin. He talks about me? Oh, non-stop. I feel like I know you. Mr. Goodwin is in a meeting across town. Would you like me to tell him you called? Yeah. Yeah, please. Thank you. Hi. Hi. Are those for me? Oh. Right. Right. Yes. Thank you. They're beautiful. You're welcome. Well, if we want to make the reservation, we should probably get going. Lead the way. Okay. Maybe I just misread the situation. I mean, they're just emails. Maybe he was just being friendly. Well, that doesn't sound like him at all, Maybe if he knew you were the one that sent them, he'd feel differently. You know, you should've seen them together, though. He looked so happy. I mean, you remember what he was like when he first came to the agency. "Frosty the Snowman." And he's opened up so much. Because of you. But, you know what, if-if he's happy with her, then I don't want to spoil that. It's his loss, Mel. That's what I keep saying, and you can do better. The fireman still has your number. Well... There's a fireman? He is so handsome! I think... I have a picture. Oh... He is! Okay, guys... Come on. I think this could be good for you. When was the last time you had a really great date? I'm not looking for a really great date. I'm looking for a really great, genuine connection. Like the kind you had with Donovan? Well, I... I just really like him... you know? And I thought, for a minute, that maybe he felt the same way about me. I'm sorry, Melly. It's okay. You know what, guys? It's fine. It just... It isn't meant to be. I had a really nice time tonight. Me too. I've actually been meaning to do this for a while. Really? Yeah. I just never had the nerve to ask you. Well, it's a good thing you drew me as your Secret Santa. Secret Santa? Yeah. Yeah, I kind of pieced it all together. I'm not your Secret Santa. Well, you two really knocked it out of the park with this one. We make a great team. Yes. We do. To many more campaigns. To more campaigns. Good work, Melanie. You too. Oh, my gosh, that was awesome! Congrats! Thank you. Sorry, Mel. It's okay. That was something really special. So full of heart. Yeah... that's all Melanie. I was beginning to wonder why we never had that second date. Guess I got my answer. Oh, no. It's not like that, really. Are you sure? So, something just occurred to me. What if the reason Donovan is suddenly so cozy with Alicia is because he thinks she's the one he's been talking to online. What makes you think that? I don't know. You threw him off the trail early and sent him on a wild-goose chase. So, he found the wrong goose. Maybe... or maybe he just likes her. Maybe. Maybe, instead of playing Secret Santa, I just played Cupid. Hey! - Hey. - There you are. I was wondering if you maybe wanted to grab dinner tonight, before the party, to celebrate? You know what? I can't. I'm meeting Jude. Raincheck? Sure. You are going to the party, though, tonight, right? Yeah. Yeah. I guess I'll see you there. Yep. Do you have the print mock-up? I told Farnsworth I'd give it to him before we left tonight Yes. It's-It's on my desk. Okay. Thanks. Sure. This was just delivered. Oh, thank you. It's from my son. Okay, the cavalry has arrived, so let's get you ready. Yeah. You don't sound excited. This is one of your favorite nights of the year. Yeah, but it's also the Secret Santa reveal. So, in a few hours, Donovan's gonna know that he's been talking to me, and that I've been pretending to be somebody else. I am sure he'll understand. I hope so. It had to come out eventually, Melly. You can't hide behind a screen forever. You're right. Yes. You're right. Mm-hmm. It'll be fine. I promise. 'Kay. Now, let's get you looking fabulous, okay? Okay. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Dad. Hey. I got you a coffee. Cream, two sugars, right? Yeah, you've got it. Um... thank you for meeting me here. There's... ...something I've been wanting to talk to you about. What is it? Um... It bothers me when you say I've missed my calling. I know you're disappointed that I didn't become a lawyer, but I love what I do, and I'm very good at it. When I say you would have been a brilliant lawyer, I mean it as a compliment. I guess, selfishly, I had hoped that it would be something we could share. I'm... I'm sorry if I made you believe I didn't respect your decision. Do you? Of course I do. I'm very proud of the man you've become. I'm very proud of you. Really? Yes, son. I am. I've also been thinking a lot about Christmas. I'd like to spend it together as a family. Well, after all these years, I-I just didn't think it was that important to you. These last few weeks have really showed me what I've been missing. Dad, I want us to be closer. You, me, Caitlin. I would love that. You have your own life and Caitlin has hers. I guess I just assumed that you were okay with the way things were. No. No, not anymore. You know, um, when your mother died, it was... it was easier to just lock myself in the office, focus on providing. But as I've... I've grown older, I've come to regret the time I lost with you both. Let's not waste anymore time. Come over for Christmas. Okay. I called Caitlin. She's gonna fly in. And just how did you manage to pull her away from work? I'm an ad man, Dad. I can sell anything. Who's this? Oh... This is Melanie. And just who is Melanie to you? She's my Secret Santa. It's a nice venue. Yeah. Hi. Moment of truth. You ready? Yes. Yes. It's time to face the music. Okay. Worst-case scenario, he's a little miffed, and you two just go back to being the way you were before all this started. Like, back to when we didn't talk at all, or... when we were just coworkers who made idle chit-chat in the elevator? I don't want to go back to that, and you know, I don't even think that I could. Well, lucky for you, I'm betting on the best-case scenario. Which is? You get everything you want. Everything? You deserve it. Hi. Hi. Did you just get here? No. I've been around. Oh. Did you come with Alicia? Alicia? Yeah, um, I heard you two went out. Oh... Word travels fast. Well, it was a one-time thing. We both decided we would be better as friends. Oh. You look beautiful. Thank you. Welcome, everyone. Welcome! Welcome. So nice to see you all here tonight. I trust you're all having a good time? Yeah. Folks, it has been an absolutely wonderful year for the agency, one full of many, many successes, and we owe all of that to you good folks and all your hard work, so thank you very much. Thank you! Before we go any further, I have a little bit of business to take care of. As many of you already know, James Porter will be retiring this year. Yes, I know... and he leaves some very large shoes to fill. But after some careful deliberation, I feel that I have found the perfect candidate to fill those large shoes. Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together please. A round of applause for Miss Melanie Welsh. Thanks, guys. All right, now, DJ, let's get this party started! Would you like to dance? Oh. Yes. Yeah. Congratulations. Thank you. I know you wanted the job, too. I did. But you deserved it. I learned a lot from you. Well, thank you. Oh, my goodness! Okay, the next one is for... Jacqueline! Look. It's a little reindeer. It's wonderful. It really brings out your eyes. Who's my Secret Santa? It was me! Oh, Betty! Thank you. Okay. Next, we have... Donovan! What is it? A tie. What's underneath? Basketball tickets. Wow, what a thoughtful gift. Who does Donovan have to thank? Thank you. You're welcome. Next one is for... - ...Alicia. - Thank you! He's leaving. I blew it. Maybe he's just getting some air. No. No, I should've told him sooner. Earrings! Oh, they're so cute! Thank you, Secret Santa. Okay, everybody, that's the last present. Thank you very much, folks! Wait! Melanie didn't get a gift. You didn't? Oh! Uh, no. I didn't. But you know what, it's okay, it's fine. That can't be right. - It's gotta be here somewhere. - It's totally fine. I don't need a present. Hey, guys! You've got to come check this out! Everyone, let's go! Everyone, come on. What is this? Melanie... I'm your Secret Santa. What a lovely gift. - Are you in? - Yeah. Definitely over $50. You get warm. Thank you for the tickets. Oh... And the tie. That was a really nice touch. Well, it was what you wanted. That's true. You don't seem surprised that it was me. Yeah. I'm not. I figured it out. You did? Yeah, I'll admit, it was hard at first, and then I saw the photograph of your mother on your desk, and everything kind of fell into place. Right. But what I don't understand is why you never told me, because you knew that I wanted to meet. I guess I was... nervous about your reaction. Were you worried I'd be upset? Well, we weren't exactly the best of friends in the beginning, Melanie... I wanted it to be you. You did? Yep. Now that you know how I feel, the question is, how do... Merry Christmas. What happened to "Bah, humbug"? Ah, what can I say? You won me over.
