(static crackling) (reverberating thudding) - [Phil] All right, let's get underway with the hyperdrive checklist. - [Mission Control] I have the checklist ready. - [Phil] Okay. - [Mission Control] Uh, lights? - [Phil] Are okay. - [Mission Control] Breaker check. - [Phil] Breaker one is okay, breaker two okay, and breaker number three okay. - [Mission Control] Ion drive engine check. - [Phil] All righty, uh, engines one and two okay. (thrusters whooshing) - [Mission Control] Clearance from mothership. - [Phil] Mothership, mothership, please confirm permission to depart. - [Mission Control] Roger, permission from mothership for clearance okayed at this time. Proceed to standby. (screen crackling) - [Phil] The signal flare check is completed. - [Mission Control] Roger. - [Sevarest] Let's go, Phil. - Okay. - [Mission Control] This is an order from John's mothership. Something is approaching rapidly from the north. Please check out. - [Phil] Roger. Sevarest, is some kind of test taking place near location 7402? Object 942 miles away at 10 o'clock. - Roger. - [Phil] It seems to be changing moment by moment. - Where is it now? Oh, wait, I see it. Uh, something's wrong. (alarm blaring) It's, uh, it's coming right toward us. - [Phil] Let's get outta here! (object whooshing) (explosion booming) - [Mission Control] 637, what's wrong? (Sevarest gagging) Having trouble calling, uh, come in, 637, what's wrong up there? (explosion booming) 637, what's wrong up there? (energetic electronic music) - [Mission Director] This is Space Station L-3, Constellation Control. Search Ship Constellation will lift off in 20 minutes and counting. All final systems checks completed. All final systems checks completed. 19:45 and counting. All personnel, please leave the launcher. All personnel, leave the launcher immediately. (bay doors rumbling) Ship moving to ignition status. Five minutes and counting. 10 seconds and counting. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Zero. Ignition. (engines whooshing) (waves crashing) (birds squawking) - [Radio Host] Today on this 16th anniversary, we remember the extraterrestrial object which landed on Graviton City, killing its population of six million and reducing it to rubble in an instant. The impact burned out all vegetation over a radius of 60 kilometers and the pillar of smoke could be seen 200 kilometers away. A new Graviton City has grown in the crater left by the impact and remaining wreckage of the meteor itself is incorporated into what has become our Military Command Center, which dominates the downtown skyline of our great city. It is also appropriate that the rebuilt Graviton City, a showcase of modern technological achievement, has been chosen as the center to celebrate the launch of the Constellation probe (A-ko groaning) from Space Station L-3, a space project specifically designed to identify any threats similar to the one that struck 16 years ago and to defuse it before it can cause a repetition of the devastation that engulfed Graviton City then. And now to more everyday things. It's a beautiful day here in Graviton City, so all you kids on your first day back at school will have to give up the idea of going for that swim in the lake and get down to some serious work instead. And the kids transferring to new schools today, let's hope you're happy, make lots of new friends, and get on well with your new teachers. Okay, the time's just coming up to 8:15! (alarm ringing) - Ah, I'm late for school! First day and late! Oh! (A-ko grunting) (A-ko grunting) (A-ko slurping) (objects thudding) (doorbell ringing) - A-ko, hey, hurry up, you're late! (window rattling) Hey, hurry up, A-ko! You know what time it is? - Hi, yeah, I know! I'm coming now, I'll be right with ya! Sorry I'm late! - I swear you'd sleep right through it if another meteor landed in town! (both laughing) (upbeat electronic music) A-ko, will they put us together in the same class, do you think? - I expect they will because they know we're friends. - Yeah, well, they'd better or I'll yell the place down! - What? - I only came to Graviton High because you did! (school bell chiming) - Oh, God, the time, hang on tight! (C-ko yelping) I still don't think we'll make it in time and that won't make a very good impression! There it is! We'll take a shortcut, C-ko! - If you say so! (C-ko yelping) (table crashing) - Huh? (air whooshing) (C-ko shuddering) - Ah! - Enjoy your meal! (air whooshing) (pensive music) (stranger breathing out) - What a terrible dump. (air whooshing) (air whistling) Huh? - [A-Ko] Excuse me! Excuse me! (wall crashing) (stranger groaning) (air whooshing) (school bell chiming) - [Miss Ayumi] Okay, girls, a nice big welcome for two new students joining us this semester. Like to introduce yourselves? - Well, my name is A-ko and I'm really happy to be here! - Hi, everyone, it'll be great, and when I say great I mean great, making new friends here! - That's very nice, only what's your name? - I'm called C-ko, don't you think that's cute? Do you think it suits me? I do, it kinda expresses my personality. And I must say, you're pretty as well! The prettiest schoolteacher - Oh jeez! - [C-ko] I've met! (giggling) - [A-Ko] C-ko, shut up! - [Miss Ayumi] Thank you. (C-ko giggling) - [A-Ko] C-ko, shut up, you're embarrassing me! - [C-Ko] I don't care, let it all hang out, I say! I'm gonna love this school, I know it! It's so much fun! (giggling) - [Miss Ayumi] There there, dear, I think that's quite enough. - Oh, what a mouth I've got! - C-ko! - Now, where will you sit? - [B-Ko] Excuse me, Miss. - I'm getting a bit impatient, what do you want? - If they sit near me, I might show them the ropes the first couple of days. - That's a good idea. So, C-ko, you sit on B-ko's right side while A-ko takes the place next to the window. - Uh-uh, uh-uh, I wanna sit by the window! - Stop complaining, will ya? Miss, let her sit where she wants. - Well, if you think that'll settle her down. I don't care as long as you don't. - Hurray, I get to sit near the window! And as long as everybody's happy, then that's all that counts! (students whispering) (students giggling) Great! - Thanks for offering to help. So ignore me. - [Miss Ayumi] Quiet, everyone, and let's begin. - [Students] Shh! - C-ko, face the front and pay attention, would you? - [C-Ko] I'm bored! - Well, if I can persuade you to listen, you might be less bored. - Ah! I'm sorry, teacher, I promise I'll concentrate. This place looks great. (students laughing) - [Girl] Over here, over here! - Bring it forth towards me! A bit further, line it up with this one. (machine clanking) (rockets whooshing) - Wow! - Hey, can I fly as well? I'd like to try a rocket too! Ooh! (blow thudding) (C-ko groaning) You hit me! - And I'll probably do it again if you don't pay a bit of attention! (C-ko whimpering) (C-ko wailing) Stop, stop it! Stop crying, C-ko, please! Oh, there's a good girl, I didn't hurt you, did I? Oh God, what have I done? You won't report this to the head teacher, will you? (school bell chiming) - [C-Ko] Surprise! - That for me? - Mm, just something I ran up out of my Cordon Bleu lunch book, try it! - Mm, well, uh, remember the last lunch you made? - Oh, that was a long time ago. Come on, mouthwatering, hm? - Uh, gee, thanks. - Doesn't it look delicious? (playful music) (A-ko groaning) (A-ko gagging) That's pretty terrific, ain't it? What about that? (A-ko groaning) Oh! Hey, you've gone all blue in the face, A-ko! What's the matter with her, don't she appreciate home cooking? All anyone'll eat these days is junk food. (C-ko yelping) Help, help, fire, fire! (C-ko groaning) (C-ko screaming) I'm gonna blow up! (C-ko screaming) What did I put in it? I don't wanna die! I've poisoned us both! (C-ko screaming) I didn't mean it, I swear it was an accident! (Mari chuckling) Oh, everything's going black! (B-ko chuckling) My life's flashing before my eyes! Tell them I died with my cook's hat and apron on! (C-ko yelping) (B-ko chuckling) (school bell chiming) - Oh, there's the bell! Time for afternoon class! - When the poet says, "O, to substantialize "this suppositious ontological quiddity," he is expressing something which I think you'll agree is central to most people's lives. At the same time, what does it tell us about his absurdist views of human existence? A good question! Then his obsession with ecumenical transcendentalism is revealing. From here, it is but short-- - Great! - Imaginative leap-- - Laid back after that Cordon Bleu lunch of yours! No surprise we're out there with placards around our necks described as a pair of hostile, disruptive students with no regard for the school. That's some reputation! Next time, you keep your lunchbox to yourself. (C-ko wailing) - I thought we were good friends so I wanted to give you something! (wailing) - For Pete's sake, stop blubbing, we'll get sent home if you don't! - Shut up, will you? I've had just about enough for one day, in fact, I've had enough to last me a lifetime! I won't put up with this kind of thing in my class! (C-ko wailing) C-ko, stop crying! How old are you anyway? A-ko, do something, make her stop! - Is the substance really a phallic illusion? - Oh, what an interesting question! We might get the answer if you read a few lines. - Right. "O, to substantialize this--" - So, let's put all this behind us and do some work now. - But if A-ko had been a bit more-- - So it was all your fault! Why are you making C-ko cry? No more crying now, wipe those tears away. - You'll stay behind when school's over and clean the classroom up. (A-ko groaning) Oh? B-ko, why have you stopped reading? - It's a short poem. You don't keep us busy, do you, Miss? - What? But you won't go complaining to the headmaster, eh? Oh, come on, girls, let's see how hard we can work for the rest of today's lesson! (school bell chiming) Ah, what a shame, time to go home. - Having really-- - So the lock gets stuck on my bicycle. - A-ko, look, I'm terribly sorry you're being punished, I know it's my fault, I'll never let it happen anymore. - Forget it, I've had school detentions before. You go home, this could take a while. - No way do I go alone, I'll wait for you! - There's lots to do, it could take me quite a time. - Still, I'll wait for you outside, A-ko! - Okay, if you like. I'll get this done as quick as I can, then I'll pick you up at the school gate. - [C-Ko] Right, see you there! - Yeah. - I think we're going out. - Shh! - Wait 'til tomorrow! - Oh, that. - Oh, I'd love to, yeah! - Come on! - You think so? (A-ko grunting) (desk thudding) - Let's go. - Bye, see you tomorrow! - See you tomorrow! - Don't forget take this! - Okay! - [Student] Do you wanna walk this way with me? - Okay, cool, great! - Are you gonna pick me up in the morning? - Yeah, do you want my number? - No, my mom doesn't-- - Oh, that's too bad! - See you tomorrow! - C-ko! - [C-ko] Hm? - A-ko's still working and she says would you go see her behind the gym block? - Huh, really? - And pink! - What's she doing there? - You're right! I thought she had to clean the classroom? - [Asa] I don't know, maybe she's emptying the trash there. - Yeah, right, I'll go and help her out! That's the least I can do! - Sound off! - Three, four! - Change count! (Asa chuckling) - [Runners] One, two, three, four! One two! - Three four! * La la la la * La la la la la la (knuckles cracking) - [A-Ko] Whee! (water splashing) Whee! * La la la la la la - Asa, I don't see A-ko anywhere! - Just go a little further along. (C-ko yelping) (ominous dramatic music) (knuckles cracking) - Hm? (Mari chuckling) Hi, hi, big boy! - What? I ain't no boy just because I shave every day! You gotta be initiated, which you might find painful. - Scissors, yeah! Scissors, scissors cut paper! - Huh? (C-ko giggling) - [C-Ko] Go again! One, two, three! (Mari growling) Paper! Paper wraps rock! - Huh, what? (C-ko giggling) Huh? - I won again! (giggling) You aren't very good! Let's do it again, one, two, three! (Mari yelling) Aww, don't be a sore loser! (birds chirping) - [B-ko Voiceover] I got to have that girl for myself and I know how to get her. First, I get A-ko out of the way, then I tell Mari to frighten her. (blows tapping) I come to her rescue. She'll fall in my lap and A-ko's history! - Ha! (B-ko chuckling) (Mari growling) - Come on, what'll we play now? (Asa gasping) - Mari, calm down, wait for B-ko to get here! (gasping) Remember? - Hi-yah! Ee-yah! (C-ko screaming) - Mari, can't you do anything right? (C-ko screaming) - C-ko! (energetic electronic music) (Asa screaming) Hey! (A-ko grunting) (Mari growling) (B-ko panting) - It isn't too late as long as A-ko isn't there yet. (tires screeching) (A-ko grunting) (air whooshing) - And now say your prayers! (C-ko shuddering) - What? (Mari shrieking) Oh? (Mari grunting) Oh, A-ko! - C-ko, are you okay? - [C-Ko] Okay, A-ko! (Mari grunting) - What a bully! - Crossed Fist of the late Akuki School. (Mari growling) (Mari yelling) (shirt crashing) (magical chiming) (wall crashing) (Mari screaming) - Hey, you're terrific! (A-ko laughing) We showed 'em, didn't we? - A minute more and you'd have been hurt. - [C-Ko] Mm-mm! - [A-Ko] Had enough excitement for one day? - [C-Ko] Yeah, let's go home. - Where are they? Perhaps they took her away. I'll find her. (B-ko gasping) (air whistling) (stranger laughing) (calm rhythmic music) (water splashing) * Looking in your eyes * How I hope that you will - [B-Ko Voiceover] C-ko. God, she's beautiful! My heart's been racing ever since I laid eyes on her. She's got such a great laugh, and even when she cries she's cute! Her eyes, the way she moves! C-ko, you've gotta be my friend! (air whooshing) So I've got to get A-ko out of the way, that's for sure. But how? Even Mari was no match for her. Then I'll take her on myself! I'll beat her, even if I have to reveal my true powers. * To be next to you * Shine your light on me * Nothing else will do * Deep inside my heart * I believe that you and I could be * * Friends forever more * Through eternity - I could swear I've met A-ko, I remember her. I'll have what I want, no matter what it costs! (scope whirring) (stranger sighing) - Why assign me to this beat? Hm. (scope whirring) (stranger chomping) (air whooshing) (air whistling) (stranger yelping) (stranger crashing) - [A-Ko] Sorry! - [C-Ko] Wouldn't it make things simpler if you got 10 minutes earlier? (energetic music) (tires screeching) (B-ko moaning) - Huh? C-ko! (air whooshing) Huh? - I thought I told you to clean the room, not destroy it! Look at it! Desks smashed to pieces, chairs in bits! It looks as though a typhoon has hit it! Or some creature with the strength of a superhuman! (B-ko yelping) You're going to repair each and every piece of furniture in the place, no get on with it! (hammer clanking) (A-ko yelping) - (yawning) Hungry! - [C-ko] A-ko, A-ko! - C-ko? Is that you, C-ko? - [C-Ko] Lunch time! (A-ko yelping) Hee! (A-ko yelping) (A-ko crashing) Oh, you're sick? - [A-ko] No, not yet at least. - Well then, if you feel ill, I suppose you shouldn't eat. (sniffling) Not if you're sick. Even so, it's a shame, my food going to waste (sniffling). Hey, I'll tell you what, I got a terrific idea! School's out for the day so let's go downtown and find a little adventure! - Yeah. - Okay? - Yeah, anything! - Great, that's great! - Anything at all! - That will soon set you on your feet again! - Only no lunch! - [C-ko] Great, terrific! We could take a look at the Command Center and even end up going to a movie! - [B-ko] Follow them. (playful upbeat music) * Your imagination is all you really need * * When you start believing * Love is just a kiss away * Life is what you make it * There's no guarantee * It's you who has the power - Be sure to have a nice day now! * And love is just a dance away * * When you start believing * You can do anything * Let the magic fill you * Take you above the highest star * * Dance away * Your sorrow * Dance away - Wow! Oh, gee! (footsteps tapping) - Shit! (can clanking) I ain't doin' his dirty work no more! Uh... (metallic whooshing) No! (footsteps clanking) No! It's, it's the Colonel! (man yelping) (A-ko yelping) Keep away! (man screaming) (A-ko screaming) (C-ko screaming) * When the world around you - Ah, great film, wasn't it? - Mm! I'm glad that you're better, I got real worried at lunch time. - Do you mean to say you were really worried? That's a surprise! You normally only get time to worry about yourself, C-ko. - That wasn't a nice thing to say to a friend like me. - Even though it's true? - [Announcer] We interrupt our scheduled program for a newsflash. Constellation Control has just issued a statement-- - Okay, I forgive you, - That all signal to the-- - Let's go! - Science Academy's unmanned deep space probe ceased abruptly a few minutes ago. Constellation, which departed from Space Station L-3 last week, was in the neighborhood of Iapetus and was due to pass by Jupiter before leaving the solar system. A spokesman for Constellation Control attributes the communication loss to a transmission failure. (A-ko and C-ko laughing) - A-ko, next time we've got time off I wanna go up the Seaside Building and take a look at the planets and stars in their planetarium. - Yes, all right, if you like. * You might make all your dreams * - A-ko, do you mind if I tell you how much I love you? - I love you too, even if you drive me insane. Oh, my toe! (A-ko groaning) (cable creaking) * Dancing into the light (A-ko groaning) (C-ko laughing) (cable snapping) (air whooshing) (A-ko gasping) - C-ko! (beam crashing) (C-ko yelping) - Wow, that's amazing! - Will you get a look at that? - God, she must be strong! - Are you hurt? - Hey, that cable wasn't supposed to break, I wonder what happened! Gee, what's keeping it up? Can't be what I think I'm seeing. (crowd applauding) - Wow! - It's Superman! - [Man] That's ain't a man, she's a girl! - Maybe, but this is some girl! - Some kinda stunt girl! - Hey, I'm not! - [Woman] Well, it sure is a mean stunt! - [Boy] Can I have your autograph? - [Woman] What time's the next performance? I missed it this time around! - [Girl] She's terrific! - She's amazing! - Did you see that? - My arm, it's killing me! (air rumbling) - [Captain] Do you have a status report on the collision? - [First Officer] An unidentified metal object obstructed our passage through hyperspace. - [Captain] Damage report? - [First Officer] A small crack is visible in the outer skin of section 21. - [Captain] Initiate repairs. (console beeping) - [First Officer] Captain, a signal from planet Earth. - [Captain] One of our operatives, put it through. - [D] This is Operative DC138621-S113, code name D. - [Captain] Go ahead. - Captain, I, ah, Captain, I believe our long search through the universe is over and I have found the person we're looking for at last. - Oh, really? You found her? - [D] I believe so. - [Captain] You're not certain? - I cannot confirm with complete 100% certainty, but I estimate a probability of 80% at this moment in Earth time. - Hm, report again when it's 100% - Right! (console beeping) (footsteps tapping) - [Captain Voiceover] So we've found her at last. (dog barking) (curtain rustling) (film reel clicking) (gentle music) (door creaking) - Huh? - [Computer] The background information disk you requested is beside you. - Thank you. (machine whirring) Huh? Of course, that was it! (B-ko laughing) That was where our paths first crossed each other. (alarm ringing) (A-ko grunting) (muffled alarm ringing) (A-ko grunting) (doorbell ringing) (A-ko yelping) (objects clattering) - [C-ko] Huh? (footsteps thundering) - [A-ko] Hi, C-ko! (A-ko yelling) (A-ko panting) (air whooshing) (D groaning) - Let's see here. The certainty factor's gone up, 85% (air whooshing) (D screaming) - Did we smash into someone? - No, straight through him! (energetic music) (air whooshing) (air whistling) (A-ko gasping) - I've been waiting for you, A-ko. - Well, that was friendly of you, B-ko. - You and me have got some outstanding business from a long time ago. - What business are you talking about, B-ko? We two only just met! - We didn't just meet, you and I began at the same kindergarten, and C-ko was there too. - [C-Ko] Huh? - We all started at the same kindergarten? - I can't believe I didn't recognize you at once. You haven't changed at all, you're still the same self-righteous little bitch you were then. (air whooshing) I remember the day everything changed, the day the wolf escaped from the zoo and almost killed C-ko. (gentle chiming music) You saved her, and from that moment C-ko was never the same again. She'd been my friend, but not anymore! After that, you two were always together and you seemed to have so much fun, it made me really mad. Even when you had fights it didn't stop you being friends, and you still are! A-ko, you haven't forgotten the girl who swore she'd get even with you for taking C-ko away from her? - What? Afraid so! And I've got a pretty good memory. - [B-ko] Who challenged you? - Sorry, but I don't remember. Anymore clues? - [B-ko] A fight to the finish? (A-ko groaning) - [A-ko] Yeah! (A-ko groaning) - A-ko? - Yeah, now it's all come back! - [C-ko] Oh, who was it, A-ko? - Her piggy eyes, basin haircut, and dumpy legs, and she had that nasty superior expression I used to detest! - [C-ko] Oh! - [A-ko] She thought she could do anything because her daddy was rich, and she used to pick on you all the time! She used to put spiders and frogs down your back. - [C-ko] Yes, I remember! But you saved me from her every day! - And then at last she said she was going to fight me, a fight to the finish she said, but that was the very day we moved house, and so it never happened. Her name was, wasn't it something like, I think it was, Blinko, Burko, or-- - I made such a big impression on you you don't even remember my name. Hmph! - You! - I was that girl and my name's B-ko! - B-ko, is it you? It is you! Yuck! - I challenged you to a fight, A-ko, and you ran away like the little coward you were! I challenge you again, winner take all and C-ko is all! (dramatic clanging) - (giggling) Oh, come on, you're crazy! She can't really mean she wants to fight me again now! - And anyway, I'm not up for grabs! - Well, I guess it's time for class, so I'll pass your offer up, thanks. - Wait a minute, you don't rush me off! I get what I want and what I want is a fight! - [A-ko] Cut it out, B-ko, that was 10 years ago! And you can't fight for C-ko as though she's some sort of a prize. - Yes I can, yes I can, yes I can! We'll call it our own Super Bowl. (B-ko grunting) (tense electronic music) One last thing, just to make the fight fair I want you to meet someone. (power suit whirring) (giggling) My ally. This is a power suit I invented and built as I know how strong you were as a kid and I'm sure you've added a whole new battery of fighting skills in the meantime. - [Ena] B-ko, are you really sure this is a good idea? - Shut up, Ena! - [Ena] Sorry. - Is this what you call a fair fight? - I don't! - [Ena] It may not be fair, but that's the way it is. So why don't you give in now so that I don't have you on my conscience for the rest of my life! Please? - Ena, kill. (footsteps booming) (B-ko chuckling) (blow crashing) (Ena screaming) - Gosh, A-ko, the power suit seems to have lost some of its power! (school bell chiming) - Oh, gee, there's the bell, hurry! - [C-ko] We're going to be late again! - [A-ko] What'll we tell Miss Ayumi? - She beat me again! I can't take it, I can't! (welder crackling) - [B-ko Voiceover] I must have C-ko as my friend. Tomorrow, tomorrow'll be the day. (B-ko chuckling) And as for you, A-ko, tomorrow's your last day! (B-ko laughing) (A-ko breathing heavily) (A-ko sneezing) (A-ko screaming) (air whooshing) - Gotta get that identification percentage factor up. I'll get it to 100% for sure today. (bodies crashing) (D screaming) (energetic music) (D crashing) - [A-Ko] Sorry! - Hey, wasn't he the same man we almost killed yesterday? - Well, he seems to have survived! Ah! B-ko! - Well well, so A-ko, you didn't have the sense to stay home. - [A-Ko] I don't give in to bullies! I came to school to study! - Oh, aren't we a goody two-shoes! Anyway, as you did come, you deserve a nice welcome. All right, let's have her surprise now! (grim dramatic music) (machine whirring) - Oh, a customized convertible! Boy, isn't it great? - [A-ko] Oh! - (chuckling) Wait 'til I demonstrate what it can do. (machine whirring) (electricity crackling) (machine whirring) (console whirring) (robot stomping) - [C-ko] Wow, it's cool! - Thank you, C-ko, it did take me most of last night to build it. The MAX-5000. Standard features include: the MAX Arm Crush, these drills made of nigninium alloy go through five-meter thick steel plates in 2.4 seconds; the MAX Bomber Saw, razor-sharp extending shredders designed to reduce evidence to absolute deniability; the MAX Beam, this reaches 1,000 degrees centigrade and vaporizes any physical body instantly; the Multiple MAX Facility, a helix of holograms which throws the enemy into total confusion as to what is real and what is illusion. All these MAX factors add up to an irresistible weapon, the Blue God of Death! Let's forget the optional extras, even without them I think the MAX-5000 will cope with you! - A-ko, it's pretty late, perhaps I'd better go ahead. I'll see you in class! (birds chirping) - And now, Uma, all systems go! What's the matter, Uma? Give her the benefit of the whole works! - [Uma] Yeah, but I seem to have a problem. - (groaning) What's the matter with you? Just do as you're told! - There seems to be a basic design flaw, the start lever's slightly out of reach. I'm doing my best! (Uma screaming) (electricity crackling) (kick crashing) (air whooshing) (MAX-5000 crashing) (B-ko yelping) - [A-ko] Hold on, C-ko, I'll come with you! - Oh, well I guess it's back to the drawing board. (school bell chiming) (air whistling) (curtains rustling) You've humiliated me once too often, A-ko! Revenge is sweet, sweet, sweet and you, A-ko, are going to die, die, die! (pencil snapping) (B-ko laughing) (birds chirping) - Hey, whee, whee! (C-ko yelping) - You're in a pretty good mood this morning, A-ko! What's made you so happy? - I feel good because I got up earlier today! We'll be in plenty of time, and with luck we won't have to fight with B-ko because she won't expect us so early! - Whee! (A-ko giggling) - Woo! Come on, go, run! Whoa! Whee! (road crashing) (birds chirping) (pensive music) (D chuckling) - I made myself very vulnerable in the middle of the roadway, but here I've got some protection. Besides which, there's my warning device. (device beeping) Uh-oh, here they come. Huh? (door crashing) (D screaming) - [A-ko] Sorry! - Morning! - Good morning! - Good morning! - Morning! - I'm glad to see you're on time this morning, A-ko. - Excuse me, I'm in a hurry, Miss Ayumi. - She might do well in the school 100 meters! - Slow down, A-ko, we've got plenty of time, haven't we? - I don't want another argument with B-ko if I can help it. - Wow! - It's really amazing! - [Student] What's she gonna do when she sees that? - [Student] I don't know! - This is scary! - I know! - [Student] Stay here, don't go, don't go away. - Look! Here come A-ko now! - [Student] Oh, the poor girl! - Oh boy! - Oh, I hope A-ko gets the better of B-ko at last! - [A-Ko] Huh? (students cheering) - [Student] Oh, it's the most incredible thing I've ever seen! - What're they waiting here for? - [B-ko] A-ko, look around you. (grim dramatic music) - You've been busy, huh? - Oh my! Even you couldn't beat them! - I want you to meet my Abashiyama Five, though you may not appreciate their friendship. - Hey, I'm getting real fed up with all this, especially as I got outta bed 10 minutes earlier than usual so I wouldn't be late for school! I don't wanna be late again because of these wind-up toys! Anyway, I'm too old to play with them. - A-ko, I'm gonna pay you back for all the things you've ever done to me! Ruining my friendship with C-ko, humiliating me again by disposing of my robot inventions! (grunting) The time for revenge has come! You won't dispose of these beauties, they'll dispose of you! - C-ko, what's she flipped her lid about? - Hey, ask B-ko, I've no idea! (scooter engine rumbling) - As you've got to school early for once, why not go straight in so we can start work, okay? (scooter engine revving) You can always finish your girl talk at lunchtime, B-ko. - Right, yes, Miss. - Do you hear? So, come on, stop gossiping now, girls! - Okay. - Are we done? - I wanna stay and watch! - What do you think we'd see if we had to sit in class? - It's not fair! - I know! - I guess if we don't go she'll keep us in. - Yeah, I guess, better go in now. - I'd like to see B-ko get hers, though. - Oh, C-ko's not so great. - Oh yeah, that's rich! - Have you seen her blonde curly hair? (school bell chiming) - [Blue-Haired Girl] Hey, wait for me, you guys! - Now we can get down to business without interference or interruptions from any of them. (dramatic whooshing) - I managed to get up in time today and left home with plenty to make it here with a bit to spare, which will probably never happen again, but now I'm late anyway because of you, and I feel real mad! (B-ko yelping) (A-ko screaming) (blows crashing) (robot crashing) (energetic music) (air whooshing) (explosion booming) Real mad! (electricity zapping) (blow crashing) (robot whirring) (robot crashing) (A-ko grunting) (air whooshing) Strike one! (explosion booming) (B-ko shuddering) - Wow! She's got it! - B-ko! It's thanks to you I'm late again, don't you think you've done enough? - No, I haven't started! I'm gonna get you, you selfish creep! - When will you learn you can build all the robots you like and it won't make you feel any better, all it does is make us late for school! - Is that the only thing you care about? Being a good girl, charming the teachers? Well, naturally it's never occurred to you that there are some children who just aren't born with the same charm! But you don't care, you've always been the heroine while I always had to be the girl that everybody said was spoiled! Okay, if they say I'm the bad girl, then that's what I'm gonna be! - Look, can't we talk about this? - It's too late! (jacket whooshing) (B-ko yelling) (grim dramatic music) Now, now I'm dressed for action. This suit gives me the power to match you in unarmed combat! (students laughing) - What does she look like? - Oh! - And number one-- - I quite like her boots! - Oh, come on! - So stupid! - Ain't it cold enough? - Oh, gee! (both laughing) - [B-ko] Laugh all you like! En garde! - I'd better go on into class, A-ko. - Sure, and do something for me, would ya? Answer for me at roll call. - Sure, bye now! - I'm ready! (energetic electronic music) Okay, B-ko, this is gonna be our last meeting! - [B-ko] You took the words outta my mouth! (air whistling sharply) (B-ko yelling) (A-ko yelling) (console beeping) (technicians chattering) - Second two. - Five. - What do you see, Bill? - Sorry, sir, it's disappeared. - [Technician] Roger, I have you. Release. Continuing. - Are you saying that Constellation's destruction was the result of certain hostile actions? - Yes, the Central Astro Agency think that's the likeliest scenario, though they can't be sure yet. - Any idea who did it? - There's no way that a bomb could've gotten planted on the craft as it stood ready on the launchpad of the satellite station, that's absolutely ruled out. - Which means it was them! - Possibly, Colonel, however, I suggest you don't jump to conclusions right now. But we could consider this: in 16 short years we have progressed at a phenomenal rate in stellar defense and it could just be an unknown galactic power doesn't like it! (jets whooshing) (D chomping) (pensive rhythmic music) - That feels a lot better. (phone beeping) - [First Officer] Earth calling! - [Captain] Put it through. - [First Officer] Right! - Operative CD138621 et cetera, code name D. - [Captain] Yeah, yeah, yeah, get on with it. You're in worse physical shape each time you call. - It's a pretty rough assignment, these earthlings play serious hardball. - Hmm. Do you have a definite ID report or is this call a social one? - [D] It's a breakthrough! There's been danger, but I've solved the case! - [First Officer] Data coming in! - [Captain] Put it on the monitor. - [First Officer] Right, Captain. - [D] The technical quality of these pictures may not be up to my usual standard, but they were obtained in extremely difficult conditions. The speed of the subjects approach on each individual sighting finally burned out the auto-control and necessitated a switch to manual recording. - [Captain] Hey, that's a second-generation Nagota class ship. Brilliant results, D! - Thanks, I set the shutter at A for long distance and aperture was 14 millimeters in strong light. - No doubt about it, that's the princess! I'll get the Pilot Star for this! I'm heading for Earth sector now, proceed to phase two! - Right, Captain, count of me to get things organized! (console beeping) - [Captain] This calls for a little celebration. For 16 long years we've searched the universe and at last we can return home! Damn, you can never find a drink when you want one! I don't ask for a lot, just a little drink now and then! (air rumbling) (alarm wailing) (technicians chattering) - [Shireikan] What do we got? - An object which we can't identify has penetrated our absolute defense sphere and the course it's now on will bring it into collision with this station in 40 seconds. - What? - [Tactical Officer] Unidentified object carrying intelligent life for an estimated fighting power above level 300. - Sound action stations, condition red! - [Tactical Officer] Roger! Action stations, action stations, all strike units scramble immediately, all strike units scramble immediately. (dramatic electronic music) (machines whirring) (machines rumbling) - [Strike One] Strike units ready for take off! - Roger, Strike One. Sir? - Strike units take off. - Aye aye, sir! Command Center to Strike One, launch all units. (engines whooshing) (ships whooshing) - [Strike One] Strike One to all units, take up attack formation E. All units, take up attack formation E. - [Tactical Officer] Target maintaining speed and has now penetrated Sector Yellow Two. No change in target's course, which is calculated to take it into Earth orbit. All strike units intercept and disable. - [Strike One] Roger. (missiles whooshing) (explosions booming) - What's happening? - [First Officer] Unprovoked surprise attack, Captain! - [Weapons Officer] Engage synclonic deflectors! - [First Officer] The enemy is from the third planet, Captain! - That's where our lost princess is being held. How appalling to have to endure their unrefined appetites, but chin up, princess, we'll rescue you, but first I could use a couple of drinks. If we take any more Earth missiles, strike back at them. Let the puny Earthlings oppose our power and I'll show no mercy! (explosions booming) (missiles whooshing) (explosions booming) (lasers whooshing) (explosion booming) (missiles whooshing) (explosions booming) (lasers whooshing) (explosion booming) (explosion booming) (lasers whooshing) - [Strike One] Jeez, look at it, look at the size of it! (lasers whooshing) (missiles whooshing) (explosions booming) (explosion booming) (lasers whooshing) (explosion booming) (console beeping) - [First Officer] Captain, we've targeted the enemy's space station. - We don't have time to negotiate in a civilized way, destroy it! (energy warbling) (blast whooshing) (explosion booming) (alarm blaring) (technicians screaming) (both yelping) (energy warbling) (blast whooshing) (technicians screaming) (explosion booming) (A-ko grunting) (B-ko grunting) (A-ko grunting) (B-ko exclaiming) - [B-Ko] While I'm wearing this suit, my reflexes are twice as fast as yours! Get ready, A-ko, it's curtains for you! (B-ko yelling) (A-ko grunting) (blow thudding) (A-ko groaning) (blows thudding) (A-ko grunting) (glass shattering) (energetic music) (A-ko yelling) (B-ko screaming) (glass shattering) (students screaming) - [Teacher] Don't you take the time to knock? - What the? - Go! (B-ko yelling) (both grunting) (B-ko yelling) (A-ko grunting) (B-ko screaming) (B-ko crashing) (A-ko yelling) - Huh? (blow crashing) (B-ko laughing) (A-ko grunting) (B-ko chuckling) One Forichi, ha! (A-ko crashing) (A-ko grunting) Traditionally followed by the Karoke Whirl! (A-ko screaming) (air whooshing) (students screaming) (A-ko crashing) - [A-ko] Ah! (missiles whooshing) (explosion booming) - Hm, Akagiyama missiles! (air whooshing) (air whistling) (A-ko yelling) (B-ko grunting) Hey, that's tickling, cut it out! Overhead Throw! (A-ko yelping) (A-ko crashing) (A-ko grunting) So, had enough yet or would you enjoy a little bit more of the same? Okay, have it your way, this'll hurt you more than it hurts me! (B-ko yelling) (A-ko yelling) (both grunting) (blows thudding) (A-ko screaming) And now my Black Jacovini Lash! (A-ko grunting) (lash whooshing) (A-ko yelping) Down, girl! (A-ko grunting) Down, I said! (A-ko screaming) And again! (A-ko screaming) (A-ko grunting) (blows thudding) (B-ko grunting) (air whooshing) (A-ko grunting) (A-ko yelling) (B-ko yelping) (A-ko crashing) Fire! (missiles whooshing) (explosions booming) (missiles whooshing) (explosions booming) (explosions booming) - [A-ko Voiceover] I've gotta get her away from the school before it gets smashed up! - [B-Ko] (laughing) Surely you're not running away, A-ko? - [Miss Ayumi] And so the story concludes with the purple-backed black piping shrike talking to the little red idol in the temple at-- - [C-Ko Voiceover] Oh, where's A-ko got to? I covered for her at roll call, but if she doesn't get here soon-- - C-ko! - What? I don't know where she is! - You weren't paying attention again, which I'm beginning to realize is quite normal, and as for A-ko and B-ko, they're gossiping outside I imagine! (C-ko moaning) (A-ko screaming) (loud crashing) - [C-ko] A-ko! - C-ko, stop, you silly girl! C-ko, come back! (C-ko panting) What's happened to old-fashioned discipline? If you ask me, it's parents who are to blame! (students groaning) (Miss Ayumi yelping) Girls, what's happened to you? Why are you wearing bandages? Come back here at once (girls screaming) and tell me what's going-- (Mari crashing) (Mari yelling) (Miss Ayumi yelping) - A-ko, A-ko! Hey! Are you still fighting? What's happened to you? (helicopter whirring) - Hi, C-ko! - [C-ko] Huh? - If you're looking for A-ko, climb up here and you can get yourself a bird's-eye view! - [C-ko] Well, I... (Mari grunting) - [Mari] Well? - [Asa] Are you coming or aren't you? - [C-ko] Mm! (helicopter whirring) (explosions booming) - Hey, smoke! I'll bet that's the two of them still fighting it out with each other! (explosion booming) - [B-ko] Hey! (A-ko yelping) (A-ko crashing) (B-ko yelling) (B-ko grunting) (B-ko yelping) Akagiyama missiles! - [A-ko] Oh no, not again! (explosions booming) (A-ko grunting) (explosion booming) (A-ko yelping) (B-ko growling) - [Technician] Position of delta two, tango six. - The alien craft still on the same course towards Earth, sir. - Six minutes 'til our interceptor units are in firing range. - They've come at last. (jets rumbling) - Alpha One to Command HQ, still no visual contact, but I've got 'em on radar. Alpha One to all units: 10 degrees port 80,000 and let's get a look at 'em, go! (jets whooshing) There! (mothership rumbling) (grim electronic music) - Look at the sky! - Wow! - Look at that! - It's huge! - How big you think it is, eh? - I'd estimate it's gotta be four miles long from bow through to stern. (jets whooshing) - [Alpha One] Alpha One to HQ, visual sighted! Going into attack formation. (jets whooshing) (energy whooshing) (spidership whooshing) - [Bill] Defense force engaging now, sir. (jets and spiderships whooshing) (explosion booming) (missiles whooshing) (explosion booming) (missiles whooshing) (energy whooshing) (explosion booming) (jets and spiderships whooshing) (explosion booming) (missiles whooshing) (explosions booming) (jets whooshing) (civilians screaming) (missiles whooshing) (explosion booming) (spidership crashing) (spidership stomping) (tank guns blasting) (explosions booming) (tank guns blasting) (spidership stomping) (energy whooshing) (explosion booming) (A-ko grunting) - Damn it, B-ko, you're pretty persistent, aren't you? (spidership whooshing) (A-ko grunting) (explosions booming) Now, have you had enough? (ground rumbling) (A-ko yelping) (tank crashing) - Why haven't you been evacuated? We told everyone to get out of town. That's the way to safety, now get out! - A-ko, you can run but you can't hide! (solider screaming) (A-ko yelping) Muscle Attack! (tank crashing) More Akagiyamas! (missiles whooshing) (explosions booming) (helicopter whirring) - No sign of her anywhere! - Those two oughta be down in the city somewhere, judging by the chaos. - [Ena] There sure is something strange going on down on the streets. - [Asa] Yeah, I can see tanks and stuff everywhere, but there ain't a whole lotta people around. - Hey, I think I see them over there, a couple of blocks down! - [C-ko] Where, where are they? - [Asa] Mari, pedal a bit harder, can you? (Mari panting) (tank guns blasting) - [B-ko] Stiletto Leap! (tanks crashing) (explosion booming) - [A-ko] A-ko Tank Gun, fire! (explosion booming) - [B-ko] Spider Nit! - [A-ko] Spider Nit Crash! (explosion booming) (B-ko panting) (A-ko panting) - [C-ko] A-ko! - [A-ko] Huh? - [C-ko] A-ko! - B-ko! - A-ko! Hey, A-ko-- - Can you hear me? - Have you two settled your argument yet or not? - Hey, C-ko, what are you up to? Come down! - I just thought you must be exhausted after your fighting so I brought you something! Lunch! I made it myself, naturally, especially for you! (A-ko groaning) - Anything but that! (ominous music) (ship whooshing) Hey, look out! (Asa yelping) - Oh? (ship thudding) Ah, your lunch, A-ko, it'll be ruined! (ship whooshing) - C-ko! (A-ko grunting) (grand dramatic music) (ship whooshing) - [B-ko] A-ko, we haven't finished yet! - What's wrong with you? You saw what happened up there! We can finish your stupid fight later, right now we have more important things to do. - [B-ko] Well, if you put it like that. - We gotta rescue C-ko first and then I'll deal with you. (fire crackling) - Well, just once, I'll be the hero. Wait for me! (ship whooshing) - [C-ko] Take me back, let me outta here you lousy kidnapper! - Don't be upset, you won't come to harm! (C-ko wailing) Stop crying, Your Highness, we'll get you home in two light-years. (C-ko wailing) (D yelping) - I don't like this, you're kidnappers! Take this old crate back down to the ground right now! I'm gonna get shot, strangled-- - Really, I'm not that sort of person! All right, then, here's the ship. - I'm too young to die! (C-ko wailing) (air rumbling) (ship whooshing) (explosion booming) (explosions thundering) (B-ko whooshing) (energetic music) - [B-ko] I want to make it clear this truce only lasts 'til we get C-ko back, is that understood? (jets and ships whooshing) (explosion booming) (A-ko and B-ko yelping) (A-ko screaming) - A-ko! I wanted the pleasure of finishing you off myself. Oh well, can't have everything! (A-ko screaming) (jets whooshing) (pilot screaming) (jets whooshing) - A little to the side, I can't see! (A-ko yelping) (missiles whooshing) (explosion booming) (pilot yelping) (explosion booming) (A-ko grunting) - Hold tight, I'll get you down! (explosion booming) (pilot yelping) (A-ko grunting) - Jeez! (A-ko grunting) (missiles whooshing) (missiles whooshing) (B-ko whooshing) (B-ko yelling) (explosions booming) (B-ko gasping) - Boy, that is big! Well, someone appreciates that size does matter. (mothership whirring) (lasers zapping) (B-ko yelping) (B-ko yelping) (peaceful music) - Your Highness? Why aren't you pleased that we searched 16 years to find you, Your Highness? Talk to us. - [First Officer] Captain? - Why do you interrupt me? - [First Officer] Sorry, Captain, but you're wanted on the bridge immediately! - [Captain] On my way. (air rumbling) (A-ko grunting) (A-ko panting) (footsteps thundering) (A-ko sighing) (lasers zapping) (A-ko screaming) (A-ko grunting) - Drop Kick! (soldiers yelping) (A-ko panting) Death ray machine! (A-ko yelping) (lasers zapping) (A-ko screaming) (explosion booming) (A-ko panting) (lasers zapping) (A-ko yelping) (lasers thundering) (A-ko grunting) - [Captain] What is it, Spy-D? I was with the princess! - Forgive me, Captain, we have rats on board the ship. - [Captain] Rats? Not rats! - [D] Yes, Captain, these rats are Earthling friends of Her Highness who found their way aboard. - [Captain] Exterminate them! - Count on me, Captain. With all the experience I had on Earth, this'll be easy. (B-ko whooshing) (lasers whooshing) (explosion booming) (lasers whooshing) (B-ko yelping) (explosion booming) - What's that down there? (peaceful music) Why are her beautiful eyes staring into space like that? (glass thudding) (glass thudding) (shots thundering) (glass shattering) C-ko? My God, she's dead! No, hypnotized! No, drugged! That's all right, then, she'll come out of it. (C-ko moaning) Huh? - Oh dear, B-ko, I think I've been in shock! - [B-ko] Oh, C-ko, did they use some terrible alien drug on you? - No, I tired myself out whining and crying. - Ah. (C-ko giggling) You poor thing, but now let's get out of here. - Mm, is A-ko here? - She's somewhere around, I guess, but she couldn't rescue you, it took me to do it. (C-ko wailing) - I want A-ko! - Don't cry, C-ko, come on! - [B-ko Voiceover] How are we gonna escape? I'd never make it the way I came, poor C-ko'd be terrified. Maybe I can steal a plane? (door crashing) (A-ko grunting) - Mm? (A-ko grunting) (blows thudding) (A-ko grunting) (A-ko grunting) (door thudding) (A-ko yelping) (door crashing) (A-ko groaning) Mm? Yuck, I'm gonna be sick! This must be the ship's laundry! Wait a minute, they all seem to be women things. (door chiming) (air whooshing) (A-ko groaning) (A-ko panting) (A-ko yelping) (elevator whirring) Some elevator! (electronic warbling) Huh? (A-ko gasping) (sword whooshing) (A-ko screaming) - [D] Ah, you avoided that with some skill! - Ha, that was dirty, coming from behind! (pensive electronic music) - This is as far as you go, and the only way you go a step further is across D's dead body. (D yelling) (D grunting) (A-ko grunting) You really are a rat scurrying around like that! Well, this is how I deal with rats! (D grunting) - Some rats are hard to deal with! My cheek! (D laughing) It's cut! (A-ko growling) How dare you! (A-ko yelling) (D grunting) (D groaning) I'm not as easy to beat as you seem to think. (D groaning) (D yelling) - I haven't got enough breath left, B-ko! Unless we rest, I might start whining, I've got enough breath left for that! - Look, it's her! (B-ko grunting) (C-ko yelping) (B-ko grunting) (blows thudding) - [B-ko] Okay, we've gotta find a way out! These tunnels are endless. (A-ko yelling) (swords clanging) (D growling) (both grunting) (swords clashing) (both groaning) (swords clashing) (A-ko yelling) (A-ko yelping) (D grunting) (A-ko yelling) (D growling) (swords clanging) (sword shattering) (shield shattering) (A-ko panting) (shield clattering) - [D] Oh. (D growling) (D grunting) (A-ko yelling) (door crashing) (D yelping) - Holy mother! - You've got my friend! Tell your men to bring her up here quick smart! - [Captain] What men? And did you say your friend? That child is the fourth princess of the fifth queen of the Lepton Kingdom of Alpha Cygni! - I do believe that you're drunk! Listen, I've had enough bull from you guys. - Obviously there's no point in trying to negotiate with you in a civilized way. (Captain screaming) - What's wrong? - [Captain] On the console, quickly, gotta have a drink! - Huh? (growling) Look, I'm starting to feel real mad! (Captain groaning) - If I don't get a drink soon, I'll go mad! - [B-ko] Oh hell, this doesn't look like the way out! - No, hey, A-ko! - C-ko, are you all right? - (yelping) Your Highness! - He's drunk, how repulsive! - A-ko! (C-ko yelping) - As for you, A-ko, now I've rescued C-ko, I consider our truce at an end and it's business as usual. (missiles whooshing) (Captain yelping) (explosions booming) - That's dangerous! (intense music) - [A-ko] Let her go, B-ko! - Ah, A-ko, I'm so pleased to see you! (D growling) - I'll kill her! (gun firing) - Stop firing, you fool, or you'll hit Her Highness! (console booming) (all screaming) - Cut it out, stop I say, you'll hurt somebody! And you, stay away from those controls! (Captain screaming) D, calm down and control yourself! Look, I'm sure we can talk this through! D, anger's no use! (Captain sobbing) (D growling) - [B-Ko] Okay, buster! (missiles whooshing) (explosions booming) (Captain and D screaming) - All right! (minigun blasts thundering) - [Soldier] Not us! (explosion booming) - Oh! Oh boy, my head! Ah, take that, you dirty rat! (Captain laughing) (minigun blasts thundering) (energy whooshing) Ah, ah, gotta get a drink! (explosion booming) (explosions booming) (alarm blaring) - Wowee, we're out of control! (energetic dramatic music) (explosions booming) (explosion booming) - Nobody leaves here unless the booze has been taken safely off the ship first! (mothership rumbling) (technicians screaming) - Let us out! - Everybody run! - Let me out! - Let us outta here! (mothership rumbling) (soldiers screaming) (explosions booming) (mothership crashing) (explosion booming) (explosions booming) - "Not only weeps the crow, but also weeps the popinjay." (loud crashing) (students screaming) (Miss Ayumi panting) (Miss Ayumi yelping) (A-ko laughing) - Sorry we're late again! - Hi, Miss! We've got back! What happened was that these women from outer space, who look like men, said I was their princess and they kidnapped me and they were going to take me back to their planet! But before they could get away, A-ko got onto the ship to rescue me! And the Captain was drunk, which wasn't very nice, and that's probably why the ship crashed! And I cried a bit, which drove everyone nuts! But luckily, they weren't... (gentle electronic music) (alarm ringing) (A-ko groaning) - Just another five minutes! (A-ko thudding) (A-ko yelping) (A-ko yawning) (A-ko groaning) (A-ko chomping) I'm ready for a change! (doorbell ringing) - [C-ko] A-ko, time to go! (footsteps thundering) - Bye! Hiya, C-ko! - Ready to go? - [A-ko] Naturally! (C-ko giggling) - Whee! Mm! (upbeat electronic music) (debris clattering) - [Captain] Habit to support. - [D] Help, homeless alien. - [Captain] Expensive habit to support. - [D] Help, homeless alien. - [Captain] Expensive habit to support. * There's a vision in your heart * * Only you can achieve * You can climb the highest mountains * * If you only believe * If you try to do your best * Nothing stands in your way * So don't put off until tomorrow * * What you should do today * I remember I saw you shine like a diamond in the sky * * I knew that you had a dream * A dream that would never die * Follow your dream * You've got to follow it * Follow your dream * No, don't you ever forget your dream * * And you will never regret it * The world's waiting in front of you * * Follow your dream * You've got to follow it * Follow your dream * No, don't you ever forget your dream * * And you will never regret it * You'll find all of your dreams come true * * There's a light that's shining bright * * It's the light in your eyes * You can swim the deepest ocean * * Or fly high in the sky * Now's the time to shoot the moon * * Or to reach for the stars * You can be anything you want to * * If you know who you are * I remember I saw you shine like a diamond in the sky * * I knew that you had a dream * A dream that would never die * Follow your dream * You've got to follow it * Follow your dream * No, don't you ever forget your dream * * And you will never regret it * The world's waiting in front of you * * Follow your dream * You've got to follow it * Follow your dream * No, don't you ever forget your dream * * And you will never regret it * You'll find all of your dreams come true * * When you look into a mirror * Tell me what you see * Is the light that's always shining * * Shining in your heart * When you wake up in the morning * * Tell me how you feel * Is it just a dream * Or is it really real * Really real * Tell me is it really real * Follow your dream * Follow your dream * Follow your dream * Follow your dream * You've got to follow it * Follow your dream * No, don't you ever forget your dream * * And you will never regret it * You'll find all of your dreams come true * * Follow your dream * You've got to follow it * Follow your dream * No, don't you ever forget your dream * * And you will never regret it * The world's waiting in front of you * * Follow your dream * You've got to follow it * Follow your dream * No, don't you ever forget your dream * * And you will never regret it * You'll find all of your dreams come true * * When you look into a mirror * Tell me what you see * Is the light that's always shining * * Shining in your heart * When you wake up in the morning * * Tell me how you feel
