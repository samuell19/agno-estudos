- Anything to report? - Nothing unusual. They’re all staying put for now,... ...but we may see them move in tomorrow. And Agent Gray? He’s waiting nearby. Just give me the key. I’ll drive you, sir. I’m going alone. Keys. But Chief… I understand. The company is expecting me... ...tomorrow at the earliest. You've never seen me, alright? I understand, sir. "Jang Donggun" "Kim Myungmin" "Park Heesoon" "Lee Jongsuk" How was your flight? Yeah, I know. Economy sucks. You know what? I tried very hard to get you a business class,... ...but there's been cutbacks in our budget. Sorry. You're not gonna order something? I know this is a shitty neighborhood, but this restaurant... ...they make pretty decent steak, I gotta tell you. So,... ...where did you come from? Erbil. Erbil? Are we talking Iraq? You know what? You always struck me like a field guy. I knew you would come. You seem so free. Got nothing to do? You see, our friends in Beijing… They agreed to... ...step back and look the other way,... ...and the target won't be able to move until tomorrow. Yeah, we don't need to rush. If Beijing is stepping back... Why not just do it yourself? You see,... ...the condition of the agreement was that we would play this quietly. But, this whole thing might end up messy... ...and bloody. Thus,... ...the call for help,... ...again? - Jerk… - Come on. You're my friend. Just do me this favor, and I pay you back. I promise! I always paid you back! It's very simple. All you got to do is to escort... ...the subject out of that building,... ...and gently put him in the car, which is parked over there. That's all. This one's for you. A little gift. It's a Tokarev. No serial. And here is the key... ...to that building. There are 9 guards on the premise,... ...and we’re gonna close down the surveillance cameras for 15 minutes. So... ...that's gotta be enough time for you. You try some. It’s very good. Now what the hell did you do that for? I wasn't finished! Enjoy your fucking meal. Well, I gotta… I gotta order another one. "1. Prologue" Shit… He’s the girl’s father. We think he was beaten to death... ...as soon as he opened the door. Her brother. A regional judo athlete. Is that all? Well,... ...Unit Chief... Gun… Isn’t this a gunshot wound? The thing is… Unit Chief! You worthless piece of shit. Report properly. I’m sorry. Bastard… What did you just say? You want to let that bastard go? Director Comrade… Are you serious? If not,... ...what else can we do? That's what you come up with, after seeing the photos? Oh, shut up. Look here, Comrade Lee. Why are you stirring things up in my division? What? You should've stayed in Bureau 35, or either make this a quiet visit. Why come here to cause a stink? What are you implying? How is my background relevant to this case? And I’m causing a stink? Forget it, here. Your order. You and your underlings are now reassigned... ...to a fertilizer plant in Daeryong. What? Consider yourself lucky. Had you not served our country or the Bureau 35 abandoned you,... ...it would've been the concentration camp. I want no more business with you,... ...so hand over your ID and gun, then get out! "Hurray for the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea!" Hey, smile for us. Don't be so nervous, now. - Wake the hell up. - Wow, good! Very good! Gonna talk about that brother of yours again? - The judo athlete? - He’s gonna mess us up, eh? Give me that. Your brother didn’t put up much of a fight. Oh yeah, you got a 5-year-old brother, right? We tied him up to the window. Any other family members you're curious about? Hold still, that’s it. Very good. How is it? Feels nice? Tell us. Hold her, hold her down. "VIP" It's him, isn't it? Yes. From the way victim was tortured and murdered,... ...looks like it. Let’s go, we’ll be late. What? You're leaving? Is there more to see? Rain’s coming, let’s hurry. Damn it, come with me. We’re just going to leave? - Hey, it’s raining! - Go get some plastic cover! Come on! Hurry the hell up! Watch your feet! Another female victim of a serial killing in Seoul. A 30-year-old woman was found dead with evidence of sexual violence. On the victim's chest and stomach were stabbing wounds… The victim was strangled to death, which led the police to conclude that... ...this case has relevance to the Southern Seoul serial murders. Meanwhile, Detective Jo Sung-oh, Chief of the Task Force,... ...unable to bear the pressure of this serial murder case… Seoul Metro Police stated, Detective Jo’s body was found in his car... ...stationed under a hill just behind his home. Burned charcoal was discovered inside the vehicle, but there was no will. Jo’s body was moved to a hospital after 3 hours of on-site analysis. The bereaved family will hold his funeral this afternoon,... ...and Jo will be rested at a charnel house near Seoul… "2. The Suspect" Shit, the case can’t be any more twisted than this. Jo, that bastard… How could he drop everything and kill himself now? Damned coward… You know what this means for us, don't you? We're close to being goners. I think we already are. You bastard… Anyway,... ...I got no one else to replace him. Even if there was a candidate,... ...it’ll take time to fill him in. Honestly,... ...you were the go-to man on the field before Jo. Why don’t you get your boys and wrap this up quickly? Yes. I know how you feel about this. I really do… It wasn't long ago that we played dirty to kick you off the force. Right? What about my suspension, then? Revoked? Must you make me say it? Of course. - Not gonna make excuses later? - Trust me for once! You want it in writing? Just solve the case. I'll make sure to have your records restored crystal-clear... ...like how it was before the suspension. Solve it by any means necessary? Yes, but please go easy. I know you go off the books. If you go out of bounds, it’ll have consequences. So take it easy, okay? Then find the bastard that way. You bastard… Decide now,... ...or I’ll be late for the funeral. Yeah, do whatever you please. Just solve the case. Understood. No bruises though, this time. He’s gotta be presentable to the media! Don’t make him a cripple again like the other guys! Hey! "Jo Sung-oh" "Fight another day!" "To: Detective Jo Sung-oh" What’s that? Sir? - Oh, these are the tip-offs we received. - Put them here. We usually check each one, but… After Detective Jo’s suicide, we didn’t get a chance yet. "Detective Jo Sung-oh" We got a call from the lab. The lab? They got something? Did we send them a sample? I did. A month ago before I got the boot. Why? Got a problem? - And? - They think they found something. - Come. - Yes, sir. Suit up! This was inside the eggplant found in the victim ♪7’s vagina. It was so small that we overlooked it the first time. But we found something, just like you said we would. Want to take a look? They’re the epithelial cells under the fingernail,... ...and they don’t match the victim’s DNA. Okay, so this must be... We had a match with the other tissues samples we found on her,... ...so he's our suspect. Our key suspect. “Suspect”? Are you new to this? It’s the perpetrator, this bastard is the killer. But not 100 %. - Take care. - See you. - Bye. - Okay. Match it with all our list of suspects,... ...and the ex-cons who used the same killing methods. Obtain DNA from all suspects, anything we can compare to. - Find them, got it? - Yes, sir! You obtain DNA samples from these guys. Oh, this? Chief, we received a few of them already. When something happens, we get bogus tips like these. Our hands will be tied, if we have to check all of them. What I mean is… The bastards at the hospital won’t cooperate since it’s illegal… And you must not know about these pricks, but you see… Detective Jo also had to… So damn yappy. Shut your hole and stand up straight. - At attention. - Hurts… You grew a tongue while I was away. - Did you forget how I work? - No, sir. Should I care who these pricks are? - I’m sorry, sir. - I don’t care who they are,... ...unless they’re the killers. Got a problem with that? Of course not, sir. Right, the hospital? Of course they won't cooperate. It’s illegal. But,... ...so what? Will you halt the case because of that? No, sir. Why don’t you use that excuse? Say you can’t catch the killer for lack of cooperation. I’m sorry, sir. Stop being... ...sorry. Yes, sir. Understood. You got that? Yes, boss! I know how you worked till now,... ...so take your badges off if that’s all you got. The only thing that should be in your head is the killer. The process means shit. Focus on catching that bastard and putting cuffs on him. Everything else... ...is totally irrelevant to you. Got that? Yes, sir. Got that? - Yes, boss! - Then move! Bastards… With no further developments on the case, many citizens are still fearful. Unable to leave the house freely, the citizens want the police… That means shit for us. So? Is the info solid? You saw the report yourself. The police got it right, it’s those jerks. How old is the Intel? That damned Agent Gray gave it to us an hour ago. An hour ago? That’s bullshit. Only top-ranking officers can see this report. Come on now, this is Seoul. It’s like their home ground. Good for them. So what? Get with it. Do you even need to ask? What a moron. Hey. Hey. This can’t happen. These people... ...especially that bastard. He can't be the killer. When they were brought here 2 years ago,... ...I planned it, ...and you... ...carried it out. And we both got cushy jobs because of it. It’s been a month since we got a new boss. Promotion announcements will be made soon. We backed the wrong horse and ended up in this shit. So if we don’t stop this, both of us are out for good. I told you to go easy with playing politics. - I knew that old man wouldn’t last long. - Shut up, bastard. This is a jungle. Everything is politics. The weak is torn apart, if you won't lick ass. And tell me, who watched your back until now? So what, then? - Bury the whole thing? - Hey, hey... Why are you acting this way? The Yankees won't stay put. They did everything to get those bastards out of the North. The company will find out, and there’ll be backlash. We’ll settle that later. Let's locate them first. If they’re desperate, they’ll give us something. That’s our only play right now. What about their handlers? Wasn't someone looking after them? What have they been doing? I know... We received orders to go easy on the bastard, and… From whom? - That bastard Gray? - But that’s not all. He messed up... - ...with my agents. - So it's all gone to hell. Your temper can wait. Let’s get a move on, though. I sent some agents over there, we gotta find a way out first. If we’re not careful,... ...it’s a one-way ticket to hell. Just like that. - Yeah? - The police are on the move. How? I’m sure they haven’t got a warrant yet. Emergency arrest, probably. Where are you? We’re almost there. What have you been doing? What’s taking so long? Taking a trip somewhere? I’m sorry, sir. There’s a bit of traffic… Hurry, secure the target first. Got it? You owe me one, okay? Debt is there to be paid off. Call me if you need anything, I’ll pay back big time. Very good. But this is no easy foe,... ...will you be okay? A VIP from North Korea, with a VIP this size,... ...the agency won’t be too pleased. We’re not in a position to take their feelings into account. But my colleague burning charcoals to death is my business. If this doesn’t work out, my team will be next. But isn’t that what got you reinstated? Life is full of ironies, no? He got you the disciplinary action,... ...but also gave you a lifeline. Am I wrong? Everything’s a blessing in disguise. Yes? Okay, got it. - It’s ready. - Hold up. I’ll go see to him and hand him over to you. You know we're just around for the show and cake. Detective Chae. Good luck! We arrived here first, but the police barged in. So what? Did you secure the target? Well, we haven’t exactly secured the target, but… Make way! Don’t shove! Let's talk it out. Out of the way! Make way! Kim Gwangil. You’re under arrest for violating the National Security Law. What National Security Law? Here are your rights. You've the right to remain silent, and to consult an attorney. - Anything you say may be… - That’ll do. We'll finish the rest. How about an intro? Intelligence? Nice. He broke the National Security Law. He’ll need to come with us. National Security Law? Right, that. We’re in a bind, this complicates things. He’s a murder suspect, serial killing, no less. You heard of those recent Southern Seoul killings? They're his work. You got evidence? That should be discussed with the lawyers. No need to worry,... ...we got irrefutable evidence. Anyway, we arrested him first,... ...we have the jurisdiction. We’ll aid your investigation later. Come on now. That’s not how this works. See this? It's a warrant, an arrest warrant. A warrant issued by the honorable district judge himself. You got one too? No, right? Then who has the jurisdiction? Why? Want to bypass the court too? Come on, boys! Take him away. - Sure! - Yes, sir! Out of the way, make way. Thank you and take care. What's this? You said the warrant was being taken care of! My contacts at the court bailed on me. That’s your excuse? Fine, hold on, I’m going to get the court to… That ship has sailed. The police aren’t idiots. They can reach out to the media and have a feast. Come on, this isn’t a normal case. It’s a serial killing case. If this blows up, it’s all game over. Once Chae Yido goes on TV, we’re finished. Do everything in your power to stop that, at all cost. Send a lawyer to Kim and tell him to stall the investigation. And get the security camera feeds around his home and office before the cops do. Got it. And... ...what about Kim’s minions? Have you secured them? About them... They must've gone dark... ...because we can’t find them anywhere. - Both of them? - Yes, sir. Seems like it's been this way... ...for some time. Damned idiots, seriously. Is this how they managed them? Find them at all cost. The lawyer can’t stall too long, find them before then. Get their corpses if you have to. Yes, sir. Let’s move! "3. Attack and Defense" Please… Don’t kill me… I didn’t do anything wrong, please let me go… I pointed this out in the fax I sent earlier. When my client supposedly left his epithelial cells on the crime scene... ...during the estimated time of murder,... ...my client was on a road trip... ...with his friends in the south. And this is a list of his alibis. Oh, we'll look into that later for sure. But how will you refute the DNA evidence? Why was your client’s DNA found on the victim? Oh that… Shit,... ...so he can talk. I thought you were a goddamn mute. Hey,... ...you don’t stare down... ...at cops here in the South. That stupid smirk… Alright, let me hear you. How did your DNA come out of the victim’s vagina? We started a weekend farm as a hobby. We got a small land near our home. It’s got some cucumber and eggplants, too. Here. Quite a bit of eggplants. They give away the harvest to their friends and neighbors. One eggplant is hardly irrefutable evidence. We’ll look into this as well. So you arrest first and come up with evidence? Get with the times, detective. If you find more solid evidence, call us. But send him home for today. The warrant was issued today. We can still… ...hold him for another 42 hours. Anyway, nice meeting you,... ...and see you again. Oh yeah, Mr. Kim. Guess you don’t know me well yet. Okay. Keep that smirk on while you can. Buddy. I only said we got your DNA,... ...but nothing about an eggplant. How did you know it was off an eggplant? And you even prepped a photo of the farm too. Open up. They take me for a goddamn fool? Dig into his alibis’ whereabouts. Find everything and anything you can about these pricks. - Got that? - Yes, sir. - Anything from Kim's house? - We ransacked it, but nothing useful. What about his minions? I sent out APB for their arrest. Find them fast, bastard, they’re accomplices. Of course, sir. - Find them, bastards! - Sure. Go to the info division and dig into the lawyer. Especially his bank account. Should focus there. Check his bank records and see who paid his retainer. How can we do that? Stop asking me to do shit… I mean,... - ...how will you handle the backlash? - You jerk again… You’ll make me say it again? Sorry, sir. I’ll take care of the shit, so you just bring me results, alright? - Or you still don’t get it? - Yes, sir, I get it. Get a move on, why are your feet on the ground? You two, track the alibis. - Get a move on! - Yes, sir! Run, bastards! Thought those bastards could fool me? "Cafeteria" - Over here! - Sorry about that. - Took you long enough. - Sorry. - Are you new? - Yes. - It took so long. - Lunch is here! Sorry for being late. It’s gone all cold. Easy on the wheels. Hey, I asked for rice and noodles! - Come get lunch. - Good work, everyone. Security cams near Kim’s home and work were already taken by the intelligence. It’s okay. There are enough cams out there. We got tons of dash cams. Taking some of them won’t hurt us. Go through what we got. Scour every minute and every second. - We’ll get a hit. - Yes, sir! Let’s split it up evenly. Firewall is off. Frequency tracking is complete. Can we mirror what they’re watching? - Yes, if they are online. - Bringing it up on Channel 1. - That one as well. - Yes, sir. Those dumb bastards… They’re seriously going to comb through everything? What's the progress on tracking Kim’s men? Not yet, sir. Cops will be all over them,... ...put more agents on it. Yes, sir. "Seoul Gaebong Police Station" "Cafeteria" Alright everyone, focus! - Food is here. - Why are you always late? Let's eat, guys. Chief, I think I got a hit! Let’s see. Here! I got him too! - Where? - Seoul tollgate. - Chief! Here too! - Me too. Over here. Hey. Guess what this is. Go on a road trip? Is that your alibis? You got a teleportation machine? Look. Why don't you check the date and time? We found you in Seoul, here,... ...here... ...and here, too. Your alibis were elsewhere during that time. Got anything else to say? Anything at all? You’re finished, bastard. Where’s that smirk now? Yes. I understand. We’ll move in right away. Yes, sir. We found him,... ...Kim’s minion. Drink while it's warm. It’s Solomon’s seal tea. Without company approval,... ...what have you two been doing with American spies? I’m sorry, sir. Paul Gray… Of all the Yankees, you had to side with the worst one. Didn’t something feel fishy from the beginning? Kim Gwangil... He's the only son of Kim Mosul, the holder of Jang Sungtaek's China account. The CIA has never handed over anyone like him before. Those bastards… ...already knew who Kim Gwangil was. And you two took the bait without knowing anything. Dumb bastards… So? Pardon? So what will you do now? The police debunked the alibis, they’re under pressure, too. From the start, the alibis were... ...to buy us time. Can you finish the job without him? Taking his head is enough. I don’t need yours too. Get the police off your back,... ...and wrap this up by handing Kim over to the CIA. If this ends well,... ...you’ll see another day. If the company reputation is tainted... ...you two will be our scapegoats for all to see. Got that? Yes, sir. I’ll sort it out quietly. Drink up, it’s getting cold. I couldn’t reach you,... ...so I had to drop in like this. If I’m not reachable, that means I don't want to be reached. Are you thick? Did you do okay in school? I have something to tell you. I know what you came to say, and I already told your boss off. You’re in no position to tell us to halt the case. We’re not doing this over a parking ticket. This a serial killing case,... ...with 7 confirmed victims! If this doesn’t get solved soon, the media will have my neck. So my apologies to you. I can’t help you on this. My hands are full already. Let's deal with our own business, alright? And don’t come looking for me at a place like this. It’s embarrassing! It's rather awkward for the both of us. I'm not asking you to halt. Continue the case. However... ...I'd like to give you something. What? Why do you guys keep giving us things? Let’s help each other. Get him ready. What’s going on? Come with us. Will he be okay? He was raised by Kim’s family like their own pet. He will die for Kim, if he has to. Shit, what’s this? What did you just say? Release Kim? We got the offender, so let him go. No, he's not the one. Kim's the real killer. That bastard is just a pawn. Take a look. What is it? It’s from the lab. The pawn’s DNA was recovered from victim ♪3, 5 and 7’s personal items. Is that so? How do evidence we couldn’t find suddenly surface? And this. You must have this, too. This guy was captured on the security cameras... ...near where the bodies were found. And we got a full confession. So who else is the killer? Where did you get all these? Who gave them to you? Detective,... ...this is enough. Let’s wrap it up here. We got the killer, so that’s that. They went this far to make us look good,... ...why not return the favor? “They”? Hand Kim over. - Eyes forward when driving. - Yes? Sorry. Finish Kim’s report tomorrow and hand him to the prosecution. What? - But that’s… - You bastard, seriously. Yes, sir. Press conference in the morning, so get the media ready. Wait, drop me off at my place. I need to change. Okay. I’ll be right over once I get changed, so go finish up the report on Kim. What? But Chief! - Shut up and go. - Yes, boss. - Aren't you leaving? - Bye. Who is it this time? Thought you wouldn’t be home tonight again. Who are you? I don't think we're acquainted. Maybe you got the wrong house? I don’t remember cuffing you. That’s you, isn’t it? So? How's Gwangil doing? Who are you? Your eyes say you're a hunting dog. We must be in the same line of work. Where? Gangwon province? Your accent is familiar. Up north. North? Northern Gangwon? You got a case on Kim? 12 confirmed victims. 4 cases in which he wiped out the victims’ families. You’re being dramatic. How does it look? The killing methods are similar, aren't they? He toys with the victim... ...and kills her in the end. I'm from the North. To catch that bloodthirsty bastard. Lee Daebeom, Security Division from the North. "Detective Kim" Damn bastards. - You’re under arrest... - Out of my way! ...for violating the National Security Law. - You have the right to remain silent... - What the hell's going on? - Wait, chief... - Beat it, bastards. That bastard's mine, don’t you dare step in! Chief, you can’t do this. Enough of this bullshit and get the hell out. You got shit in your ears? Can't hear? What do you think you’re doing? This matter has been settled. This bastard... Chief, calm down, it’s an order from the top! Let go. Let go of me. - Let go. - Chief, please… You bastards. Are you all nuts? Let go of me now. Chief, just this once. You dare smirk? - Is that a smirk? Why, you bastard… - Stop that! - Don’t touch him! - I said, let go! Did you just laugh? Is this funny? But it’s funny,... ...should I cry instead? What? You bastard… Have you ever heard that sound? It’s my favorite. You... Do you know what sound people make as they die? Especially when the young girls die. The moan of pain. Man, it’s something. Demented bastard… Oh right... By the way, how’d the funeral go for the idiot who killed himself? Shut your mouth. You know what sound they make when they suffocate? Don’t feel so embarrassed, your predecessor wasn’t the first. You little bastard! - Hold him back! - This bastard… - Chief! - I’ll kill him! Got any more wisdom to spill? Because I'll kill you! Chief! Chief! Please don't! Kill me? Pitiful bastards. If you can, why don’t you? Why you… - Chief! Chief! - Let go of me! Why you… I said let go, bastards! Stop the reporters! Stop them! Let me go. I said, let go! "Police officer Chae Yido who is in charge for serial murder case assaults suspect." You’re photogenic. You didn’t know? You could be an actor. An action star. But at least only this site ran with your story. Other sites... ...focused on closing the case, what a relief. Hey,... ...I was up all night calling in for favors to pull that off. You’re... ...suspended for a while. From arresting and assaulting wrong suspects,... ...your record is already filled with assaults. You should've been fired for this,... ...but at least the case is closed. So for now,... ...we decided to wrap this up with a short suspension. Stay low and... ...quiet for now. That frightened me! Why that jerk… South Korea can’t touch him. It’s a sore eye to your intelligence division. Even if you wanted something done,... ...you got Yankees for a puppet master. So what, then? You’re saying you can? So why didn’t you? Why let him go wild and wait till the 12th victim? At the time, his father Kim Mosul was Jang’s right-hand man. In other words, he was "royal family." Untouchable. So we got hit instead. It was a night ambush. Two of my men were beheaded. I took a bullet and fell into the Yalu River. All the top brass knew about it but it was covered up. So... ...what’s changed? What will you do? Just before Kim defected to the South 2 years ago... ...Kim Mosul and his men were charged for counter-revolution. Which means we can now get him, too. Hand him over. I guarantee you, the South won't prosecute him. "4. VIP from the North" - Tired? - Nope. I doubt that. Is everything settled? Yes, just the tidying up now. All documents are shredded. Then check Kim Jiwon’s border crossing route for me. What’s this? It’s you? Yes, sir. About 5 years ago... ...in Peshawar, sir. Oh, Peshawar. So the Pakistani job was yours? I see. You field agents belong out there, why bother with a desk job? So... ...stick with what you’re good at. That bastard... When is the exchange? We’re in talks. Gray won't just take him, Kim’s a handful. But he won’t give up on what Kim knows. We notified we won’t babysit Kim,... ...so they'll be an answer soon. Good. Let's wrap it up nicely, alright? I don’t want any more trouble. Gather up the remaining loose-ends as well. And move into this office. By the way... That blind doesn’t fit, change the color. What is it? Where the hell is he? I’m sorry, I went out for a smoke… - Are you insane? - I’m sorry, sir. Kim Gwangil. You think we’re easy? Don’t you fret. I didn’t do much with this girl. I was simply… Hold up. What? “This girl”? Hey. Tell me again,... ...what did you say? “This girl”? What do you mean? You know, the girl you gave me before. What about their handlers? I’m sure they had some, what have they been doing? Well, uh… We received orders to go easy on him. But that’s not all. He messed up with my agents. You didn’t… I just had some fun with them, too. I didn't kill them. You bastard! Buddy. You psycho bastard. You got a death wish? Should I just end you here? Oh, man... Is this really part of your job? Shouldn’t you be protecting me till the end? The Yankees won’t be too happy about this. - I’ve had it with you! - Boss, please calm down! You'll kill him at this rate! Please, sir... Please calm down. Cuff his feet too. - Toss him in the corner so he can’t move. - Yes, sir. Get on the ground! Hold him tight! What the hell... Who are you? Know when to quit. Did it cross your mind,... ...that maybe I don’t want to answer? Have you considered my words? What? Oh, you're the Northern spy. I was right, wasn't I? Damn you. Will you hand... ...Kim over now? Are you kidding me? I’ve been stripped. I can help you. Help with what? The bastard's gone. Give it up. The game is over, pal. No. It's not over. At least I know... ...how to extend this game. Prior to arriving in Seoul two years ago, Kim and his minions stayed in Hong Kong... ...and left 2 open cases. They tortured, killed the girls and recorded the whole thing. That video... They sold it to to fund their escape. Kim's face is on that video. "Hong Kong Causeway Bay Case: Murder of Cho Yuna" If it’s Hong Kong… One of the victims was a Korean residing in Hong Kong. Damn those bastards... Did you verify? Yes, we did. His face is visible. Make enough copies and gather everyone. Even the off-duty! District Attorney,... ...let me ask you another favor while at it. It's been a long, long time, Mr. Kim. Two years, right? You look good, it’s gotta be the water in Seoul. Now after what I heard,... ...things are not going too well for you. I'm sorry to hear that. And you picked up some sick hobby. Couldn’t you have picked up something a bit more refined? Isn't that why you released me in the first place? So it will come to this. You got a point. So what now? Sounds like you are in desperate need of help. Please don't get me wrong. I don't care what the hell you were doing in Seoul. Now... ...what I am trying to figure out is,... ...what value you hold... ...and if it's worth protecting. Do I really need you? Honestly, when I look back on these last two years... I’m not so sure. What do you think? Why did you guys relocate me from Hong Kong in the first place? I asked you a question. You piece of shit. You haven't changed at all. Now, the only reason you were relocated... ...was because of the Chinese bank account your father manages. And we assumed that he had given you all the information to that account... ...when you left North Korea. So? So what? I think you know the answer... ...to my question. We couldn't find any money, Mr. Kim. Only some petty cash of yours. Which leads me to wonder if you knew anything at all. You really think so? What I think is not important. It's up to you to prove I'm wrong. Oh I forgot to tell you, some Russians are looking for you. Oh yeah, you didn't know. Now, but you see, Mr. Kim spent some years in Russia. Yeah! Studying, right? Don't you think he pulled up some sick shit over there, do you? You sick fuck. Is that why you gave us this piece of shit? Can you imagine? If this bastard started killing girls in New York City instead of Seoul? How do you think we could handle it? We can't just pull him out. And you guys. You didn't suspect one single thing. You got yourself a serious problem there. You had this guy for 2 years... ...and you came up with nothing. You couldn't even keep him on a short leash. What the hell are you guys good at? Jerking off? Come on. Hey, stop it! Easy. We’re trying to make a deal here, okay? Thank you. Why is that Pyongyang can't kill my father... ...even after they cleaned him out? Everyone called my father a genius when he was a child. He is very smart up here. But you see,... ...I am smarter than my father. You guys want his banking information? It's all in here. I will give them to you. Okay. Good. Now we’re talking. And let's talk details later... ...on our side, not here. How about we take these off... ...before we talk further? The police are here. What? The police? How did... ...they find out? Isn’t it obvious? We got wiretaps, too. Where are you off to now? A different warrant, this time. You see this? You’re quite photogenic, you know. Could be an actor. Perfect for a psycho role. Yes, sir. Out of the way! Where should I cut you? So... You still want to continue covering for him, as a fellow human? Gwangil. I’m so happy to see you again. I was depressed because I thought I’d never see you. You bastard. Hey. Where’s that smirk now, huh? Laugh and smirk like you did before. You bastard, seriously… You’re a tenacious one. Have some respect for your elders, you prick. Oh yeah, Gwangil. By the way,... ...I figured it out. The reason why you shove weird things into vagina. Gwangil, you... You can’t, right? What? This. Am I right? Jerk… You wanna die? This bastard... So I was right. I was spot on! He can’t, erectile dysfunction! You bastard! - You jerk! - How dare you attack a cop? You piece of shit. Shit. Hey. I told you, this is not North Korea. Did I tell you that or not? Didn't I, you bastard. Give it up, all of you. If you try to intercept again,... ...I’ll toss you in for harboring a killer. Got that? - Take him. - Yes, sir. Get the hell up. Don’t be a pussy. Wow,... ...that's Chae Yido? He get the job done, right? What’s the matter with you? You're not gonna go after him? But do you know where Chae Yido keeps getting all this information from? Here. And you guys,... ...you knew about it. Because the piece of shit that you picked up... ...He ratted,... ...right? Oh yeah… Well, Lee Daebeom,... ...he used to work for... ...was it called Foreign Operations Bureau 35? Before he got transferred to the Police Department up in Northern Pyeongan. Now, 3 years ago while Lee was cracking down on Kim and his gang. Lee got fired, he and his team got kicked out from the police force,... ...and sent to a fertilizer plant. Now, Kim's gang followed, they killed all of Lee's men. You see, to Kim Gwangil,... ...Lee Daebeom... ...is the North Korean Chae Yido. Come on, this isn’t right. Out of the way! What are you doing? Shutting down the task force? Without consulting me? By whose orders? The case is closed, what’s wrong with that? It’s far from over! Shit! Alright, fine. If this is how you want to play,... - ...I’ll take him to the HQ. - Get it together, you idiot. You can’t will yourself through this. Hand him over before shit hits the fan. What shit? We got new evidence! How could you say that after watching it? - Have you all gone mad? - You jerk… Why are you going nuts over a closed case? Wasn’t this a done deal? The matter’s been settled with them, too! If we continue, we’d be backstabbing the Intelligence! Yido, listen… The serial killing case is over. Cased closed! We got the killer. I mean, you did with your team. There won’t be any more victims. And this case,... ...even the Hong Kong cops swept it under the rug. So why bring it out and cause a stink? What about Detective Jo? For what did that idiot kill himself then? You’re the one who put an incompetent idiot on spotlight. You wanted the killer! You told me to bring in the killer, by any means necessary! Kim is the killer! You know that, bastard! You bastard… Hand the key and phone in, and head back with the boys. What? Chief, what will you do? We’ll come with you. Shut the hell up,... ...you’re all useless idiots. Give me the key and phone, and beat it. - Come on, Chief. - Now. Chief… Good job today,... ...so be on your way! Things aren’t working out as you had hoped? Shut up, you jerk. You have to know your limits, otherwise life gets tiring. You bastard. District Attorney, it’s Chae Yido. Are you filled in? I’ll head over now, then. What? You see, I was given an order not to get tangled up. You know my situation, we’re just a third-party. I mean,... ...it’ll look like we interfered... ...a done deal, right? So... ...drop us from this case. I heard you’re suspended. You should take it easy. This is no small business. You can’t do this alone. It could be the end for you. So what? Arrest me for violating the National Security Law? Go on, then. No. I don’t really feel like it. Besides, Lee’s status is... ...defector anyway. He defected after... ...the incident 3 years ago. He's been hunting down that psycho all along. I guess he wanted to return to post with Kim. The agency had a hand... ...in Kim’s defection. He couldn’t move in while Kim was under our protection. So instead, Lee tipped various agencies,... ...just enough to corner Kim. He’s a former spy,... ...that’s his specialty. And? So? What will you do with him? I know for a fact, he won't stop until he drops dead. He'll keep killing. I think... ...if I let the bastard go, I’m going to regret it. That’s enough. It's out of our hands now. The Americans will take him away, somewhere. What, people don't live there? Well, it's their... ...problem now. Damn it... So that North Korean spy was right. I need to take that out, too. Hey, Chae Yido! You bastard! Stop the bleeding and call an ambulance! What is wrong with you? What are you laughing at? Bastard. Jerk! You bastard! It’s been a while, Kim Gwangil. Lee Daebeom! You didn’t close down the piers. Well, I guess... ...it'll do no favor to us to have him back. Good job, let them take him. Yes, sir. In any case, it’s over. We clearly handed him over to the CIA,... ...and they blew it while he was under their custody. They can’t say anything to us. So… He’s Lee Daebeom, from Bureau 35,... ...is he? Too bad for him. Finally on his way home, after a ghost life to catch Kim, but… ...the supreme leader is dead. Now, Kim Gwangil’s cohorts are in control of the country. They wiped out Bureau 35... ...and Jang Sungtaek is in charge. Kim Mosul has been reinstated, of course. "5. Epilogue" Very good. Agent Park. It's been a while. So... ...is South Korea handling my case again? Tell the Yankees,... ...I’m different this time. Sure. I'm sure you are. Your father Kim Mosul was executed with Jang Sungtaek. You’ll be too, if you’re sent back. You're in no position to play with us both again. I know that. So what? Isn’t it obvious? I’ll spill the beans. I’ll tell them everything I know. The Pyongyang account in China. Does it hurt? Listen, Agent Park! What are you doing? It’s your duty to serve me! I asked you a question,... ...does it hurt? Park, you bastard… Why are you doing this? You can’t do this to me. Why not? Agent Park,... ...have you gone mad? You… You… Do you know what you just did? I told you, I’ll give you everything I know! I don’t need your shit. You cockroach, how dare you… Paul Gray. Bring me Agent Gray. I’m only wasting my time with you! Get me Gray! You bastard. Darn it... Then what? What?! What?! What do you want? Tell me what you want! Die. What? Die. You jerk. Die, bastard. The thing you wanted. Yeah? What have you done? Oh jeez… You must know that China is pissed off at Kim Jongun for killing Jang Sungtaek. Do you really think... ...they will let the North Koreans access the money from Jang's Chinese account? An empty can, you idiot. The Chinese cleaned it all out. Seriously. You guys didn't know? How can you not suspect a thing? Isn't that something you should be concerned about? From now on,... ...you deal with your own stuff. Don't call for help. You guys don't sign my checks. The next time I see you... I promise... I will snap your neck. Yeah… Get this out of here, now! Shit. "VIP" "Kim Myungmin" "Jang Donggun" "Park Heesoon" "Lee Jongsuk"
