How long will it take to fix? Oh! Who knows? Building codes, inspections. Now the city wants to do a full assessment. See if the building's even worth reopening. - Ma, you can't let them shut you down. - Honey. You telling me what I can and cannot do is not gonna improve my mood right now. I don't know what to do about this. If there's a danger to the kids... He's one of those kids, you know, trying to act all bad. But 10 seconds into a routine, I catch a glimpse of him, and it's like I can just see this light shining out of him. - He's a kid again. - Yeah. It's the best feeling I know seeing that. It's scary though. 'Cause when I think of him hanging out with B.B., it's like I can watch that light get dimmer and dimmer. Well, you know, when a thug joint's the hottest spot in the hood, it's hard for a kid not to want to be down. I know. I'm over here. Nah, nah, nah, nah. I wanna show you something. - All right. - All right, sexy? Stop with that. Closer to my dream You know, most of the kids I came up with were just like that. Trying to be thugged out, and wanting to fit in. 'Cause that's what everybody else was doing. Where are they now, jail? Most of them, or headed that way like B.B., or dead. Listen, this is bad date talk. We should change the subject. What's your favorite color? How come you turned out so good? She thinks I turned out good. - I'm serious. - I don't know. I got lucky. What happened? Well, the guy that used to own this shop lived right next door to me and my mom. And when he saw me get into some bad things, he gave me a job here sweeping up the floors. It's crazy 'cause he couldn't even afford it. He paid me right out of his own pocket. I worked for him for 10 years. And when he passed, he left this place to me. See, B.B. likes to talk shit like I'm the one that's losing, like I'm missing something out there on the streets, but he and I both know who's winning. I've found something that I truly love, that truly makes me happy. And that's a million times better than finding something that makes you rich. So, it's just someone believing in you. Well, that and having a place to go where I could stay out of trouble, yeah. What? Nothing. Just thinking. About what? About what makes me happy. Well, you know, I would really love to be a part of that. - What? - Making you happy. Close your eyes and see what you believe 477 Castle Hill Avenue will go for about $170,000. - So, 17 down? - $17,000 down, yes. In cash. How about I give you half the down payment now, and you give me 30 days to come up with the rest? If I don't, you put it back on the market. Why do you even want this property? It's just an empty storefront on a bad block. It's perfect for a dance studio. Maybe even a dance school for the whole neighborhood. - So am I writing a check or not? - By all means. Five, six, seven, eight. The things you do when your friend's around Has got me hooked on you You're not afraid of wilding out and trying to be too cute And when we're out up in the club, babe You never get tired You love to tease, but aim to please Your heart likes fire Girl, you ain't no joke Cut.

That's the biggest party of the year. - Got any juice? - I thought we were going to a meeting. Business and pleasure are the same thing. You know that, Honey. If I knew it was a party, I wouldn't have canceled on my best friend's birthday. You would rather go to Atlantic City, which will always be there, with friends you always see, instead of going to the hottest party in town with me? Look. Everybody is gonna be there. All right? Artists, producers, other choreographers. It would be career suicide if you didn't go. All right. Change into that and I'll meet you downstairs. Okay? Okay.

That's the cognac speaking. Here. Thanks. You know, the first time I ever saw you, I said to myself, "That girl is so fine." - Quit playin'. - Who's playing? I'm not playing. - No, seriously. Come on. - No, seriously. Yes, you are. Come on. Stop. Stop! Stop! Get off of me. Bitch, how you gonna play me like that? Oh. I see. I see. You're one of those. I'm not one of anything. I'm just not up for this. What about, "I owe you so much, Michael"? "You're the best thing that ever happened to me, Michael." Professionally, yeah. All right. That was all talk. That was all talk, right? Just so you could get ahead in life? No, no, stay. Don't leave. Don't leave. You made it. You're here. Stay. Look, it's a fancy party. You came in a fancy car. You're drunk. I'm gonna do you a favor. I'm gonna pretend like none of this happened. See you on Monday. One and two, three and four. Five, six, nice. Okay, Ginuwine, come through. Okay, Raymond. Shaker boys, in front. Come on, shake it up. Go, shake it. Come on. Come on. Shake it good, boys. Oh, oh, oh, oh! That was great. You guys were terrific. - I'm lovin' it. - Hey, hey, yo! Good job! That was hot. - Where is he? - I don't know. Ginuwine! We're ready for our rehearsal, sir. - It's all set for you. Hey, Mike. - Hi, how you doin'? Hold that for a while. All right, let's see this. - Playback! - All right, guys. Just like we rehearsed. Five, six, seven, eight. Cut. Cut! Cut. Go get the car or something. - It's not, it's not working. - Which part? The whole part. The whole kid thing. It's horrible. No, Michael. Don't do this. I was thinking I wanted to make it a little more sexy, you know. A little more real. What's more real than these kids? Oh, no. Michael, don't do this. If you want to get back at me, do that, but don't take it out on these kids. Katrina, baby. Hey. All right, now I'm gonna give you some music. Okay. And I want you to listen and then move. Got you. Go do your thing. Do not take away the one thing they have to be excited about. Look. I have a lot to do today, all right? So if you want to get paid, pack up your shit and take your little friends out of here. I want you to fire 'em. I want you to tell them why you're not using 'em. - What's going on? - Don't worry about it. What makes you think I care what you want? Yeah, the label called. They're not into the kid thing at all. For real? Man, all right. - I'm so sorry. - So it's not gonna happen? No. He changed his mind about what he wants. - Why? - Just because. - You made him mad, didn't you? - Not intentionally. Look, you guys. There will be other opportunities. - No, there won't. Let's go, y'all. - This is wack. Ugh! - What? - You're funny, right? Okay. So what happened to your big dance career? - It's weak, man. - Thug life, baby. - Yo. - That's what it is. I like those. Yo. Go cop those for me, man. Let's move. Come on, go. Come on, ladies. Let me see it. Five, six, seven, eight. Turn. Front. Back. If that's the girl we heard about, then no way. I can't get a job anywhere. Michael's blackballing me. You sure about that? Yeah. And all he has to do is mention he doesn't want me working. What kind of clown would do that, stop somebody from earning a living? I guess he figures since he gave me my career, he can take it away. Hey. He didn't give you anything. You get hired because you've got drive, talent and love for what you do. That's a gift from God, not some video director. The thing is, I was counting on that money. Not for me, for the kids. That studio could be unbelievable. It could change their life. Yes I'm gonna do me I'm gonna do me You gonna do you You gonna do you I'm gonna do me I'm gonna do me You gonna do you You gonna do you I'm gonna do me I'm gonna do me Put your hands up and come off them grams I ain't trippin' That's the way I am And if you see me wielding heat in my hand, you better duck - That's the way I am - The way I am Paying off that balance? Actually, I came for an extension. I need more time. How much? I don't know. I sort of hit a financial snag. Miss Daniels, if I could help you, I would. But I've already agreed to keep this property off the market for two full weeks for you. That's the best I can do. I know it's a lot of money. I'm sorry, Honey. We just don't have it. - And even if we did... - Evelyn, don't. Even if you did what, Ma? Honey, a commitment like that... You take that on, you are gonna be stuck here forever. You'll never leave. Oh, I forgot. I'm supposed to see all the beautiful things in this world. Well, there's nothing wrong with my wanting that for you. No, but what about what I want? You're 22 years old. You don't know what you want. You know what I see living in this neighborhood? I see kids go from bad homes to bad schools and back again. And I've seen you unlock a door to a place where those kids can feel safe. Maybe I'm dumb because I haven't been to Paris or Milan or wherever. But, to me, it doesn't get much better than that. It's a war to know your way And stay on track regardless of what other people say Seems so far to navigate It was everything I always wanted. But when I had got it, it felt like nothing, less than nothing. And now losing it feels even worse. I'm not looking for sympathy. I just need someone to talk to. Someone I know and trust. I'm so sorry, Gina. I totally let you down. Do you think you could ever trust me again? I don't know. Maybe. You're my girl. You know the first thing I thought when I saw that picture in the paper? - That hood rat lied to me. - No, that was the second. That hood rat skipped out on my birthday. No, that was the third. What was the first? That hood rat went to the black-and-white party and she did not bring me. I know you're in a jam right now, but, Honey, you got skills. And that's gonna take you places. I just thought that, you know, being your girl and all, I'd get to go, too. - You can. - No, I can't. I'm just your friend. You're the one with the goods. You're the one that people want. You don't need me. You just need to trust and believe in yourself. Like I do. Come here. Just make a U-turn Turn it round Don't worry, baby, you'll find work real soon. You're too good not to get hired. All right? I just don't have the time to wait for people to wake up for that. I'm gonna lose the building at the end of the month. If I can't earn it, and I can't borrow it, and I can't steal it... - I could raise it. - What do you mean? Well, I'm trying to get a space for kids, right? If people knew about it, they'd want to help, wouldn't they? Yeah, probably. Yeah, I could put on a benefit performance. Charge a cover. Get some donated food. Put on a great show. I could do that. Why couldn't I do that? 'Cause I don't have a space, that's why. Damn it! Come here, mami. I got an idea. That's love. Nah, baby, I got you on my Christmas list. All right? One, one. It's just off the BQE It used to be a church. The cat I was just on the phone with, he used to own it. But in three weeks they're converting it to office space, so it's empty now. - If you want it, you better jump on it. - What's it like? It's dirty. It's old. - But it has a floor, right? - Yeah. I'll take it. Thank you. - Hey, guys. - Hi, Honey. What's up? I know what you're thinking, "What the hell we doing here?" Don't worry, it's temporary. This is what we call a means to an end. Nobody's gonna give us a space, that much is clear. So we're gonna raise the money and buy it, straight up and legal. Y'all ever heard of a benefit performance? - What do you mean? Like Jerry Lewis? - Sort of. I'm Jerry. You're the kids. Let's get to work. Yo, yo Life, they wonder Can they take me under Nah, enough of that Nah, yo Yo, I come from the housing tenement buildings Unlimited killings Menaces marked for death Better known as the projects where junkies and rock-heads dwell Though I owe to it my success With survival of the fittest every day is a chal' I would think I'm a part of USA and be proud Confronted with racism started to feel foreign Like the darker you are the realer your problems I reached for the stars but I just kept slipping On this life mission never know what's next Ancient kings from Egypt up to Julius Caesar Had a piece of the globe every continent Yo, there's Asia, Africa Europe, France, Japan Pakistan, America, Afghanistan Yo, there's Protestants Jews, Blacks, Arabics Call a truce, world peace Stop acting like savages No war We should take time and think The bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct Why then must it go on We must stop the killing Tell me why we die We're all God's children All this hate can't last forever It's time that we stand together - For the world - Everybody wants to rule the world Peace Orange, good color for you. I spoke to your moms. She said you're getting out tomorrow. That's right. When you do, I want you to come hang with me. Nah. You could have a good life, Benny. It doesn't have to be like this. What do you know? You ain't got no job. You ain't got no money. - Matter of fact, you ain't got nothing. - What I got is a clear conscience. Yeah? What you gonna buy with that? It breaks my heart seeing you selling yourself short like this. So leave. Get. Let me ask you something. You know your homies, those guys that got your back? Yeah? How many times did they come to visit you? You think about that. Yeah, I don't know if this is gonna work, Missy. But... Nah, but Katrina's gonna make this so sexy, - it's not gonna matter. - Katrina. Who the hell is Katrina? - That's Katrina. - Hey. Katrina is the shit. She just did Ginuwine's new video. I don't care if she just showed Michael Jackson how to Harlem shake. I said I want Honey, Honey Daniels. Duh! Let's just try it once, and if you like it, we keep it. If not, then we fix it. So there's no problem. Let me see what you got. What you gonna do? I was thinking something a little more sexy, maybe in the hips. - No. - Lenny. No. No, no, no. What is this, this? Look, let me tell you something. I don't backup dance for Heather Hunter. I don't know what kind of pornography y'all got going on here. This has gotta be a joke. Anyway, when you get in touch with Honey Daniels, you call me. You, you need to call MC Hammer, let him know you're steallng his stuff. Y'all two crazy people in here. Give me my phone. Don't make no sense. That's ridiculous. Missy, hold up. I got an idea. Honey, what you been up to? - Bye, Michael. - Wait, come on. Come on. - Hold on. I came to apologize. - I'm not interested. Give me a break. What I did, the way I handled things was uncool, and I am so sorry. - Hey, and I want to make it up to you. - Is that so? I've got you three new jobs. And you want me to do the choreography? I am begging you. Oh, I get it. The artists asked for me and if you don't deliver, they're walking. am I right? They want you, sure. But so do I. Michael, you got yourself in such a bind. Good luck getting out of it. I'll pay. You know I got the money. I don't want your money. Are you sure? You sure about that? Because I could buy you a little dance studio. What about that? What about you come back to work for me, and I'll get you this. You know what's funny? When I first met you, you were 10 feet tall. And now I look at you, you're this big. I don't need your help. I'm gonna get that dance studio on my own. Five, six, seven, eight. Hey. - So you came. - I had to. I can't let these bustas get in front of an audience doing no... - That's wack. - Is that so? I'm gonna give you something better, 'cause it breaks my heart to see you selling yourself short. Ooh! - Let's see you bust. - Let's do this. Five, six, seven, eight. So you pick that up in juvie? That's right. I believe in making every experience educational. All right, guys, let's clump it up. We only got a few rehearsal days left. Let's make it count. - Music. - Okay. Count them in. Five, six. Five, six, seven, eight. Good. Nice. One more time. Keep it tight, okay? Can you see the stage all right? Yeah? Okay. Hey, chica. Gina. You know my homegirl Mrs. Strom, right? Your friend came by the bank and told me what you're trying to do here. I do banking for some nonprofit arts foundations. - I know some people. - Some rich people. Some people who would find the opportunity of funding a project like yours very interesting. - Are you serious? - I've invited them tonight. Oh, my goodness. Thank you so much. Don't thank me yet. Just go out there and put on a good show. Now, how am I supposed to know if I'm dressed right if you won't tell me where we're going? What you're wearing is fine. - Are you sure? - I'm sure we're late. - Where are we going? - I'm not telling. - You better tell me something. - I'm not telling. Here you go. - Does the set look okay? - Yeah, it's cool. I don't know. I feel like I should've had brighter lights or a different backdrop or colors. I don't know. Here. Yo, Honey. It's good. Just chill out. We got your back. Now get out of here. We got a show to do. Wow. You have no idea how beautiful y'all look. Thank you for coming. This means a lot to me. This means a lot to all of us. These kids are good kids, and, man, do they love to dance. Dancing isn't what they do, it's who they are. And you coming here tonight says you wanna get to know them.
