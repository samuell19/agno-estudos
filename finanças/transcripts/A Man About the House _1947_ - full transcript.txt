Try to keep pace, Josephine... ...and a little more spirit, Harriet. - My hands are so cold. - I'm freezing. Er, yes - it is rather cold for the time of the year. Still, that will be all for today girls. I think I can hear your conveyances arriving. 1-2-3-4. Hold your back straighter, Charlotte. 1-2... Yes? It must be about four o'clock, Agnes. Return the books, girls. Please, Miss, my mother said to give you this when I went. Now Josephine, where is your grammar? You do not say... Yes. Josephine's mother will be taking her away immediately. Oh dear. "Wouldn't have sent her to such a low neighbourhood except that she took pity on us... ...seeing as how you was left so badly off by that father of yours." What a beastly thing to say. Well, we cannot afford to lose any more pupils. We can't. When facing our problems, we must always ask ourselves, "what would Papa have done?". Yes, Agnes. Papa always faced the truth squarely. That vulgar woman is right about one thing. This place is as, as she says, "as cold as Christmas". We must get in more coal. But the coal merchant said... I think we can dispense with the sofa. Yes, and the easy chairs too. But Agnes, just selling things - where will it all end? When the new school in Westford Terrace has lost its novelty. You'd better slip round and get Mr Higson from the secondhand shop, again. Yes, Agnes. Mind the paint, George! Never touched it. Ask him to be as quiet as possible. That's alright, lady. Now, here we are... Two pounds, twelve shillings and sixpence. Thank you. Oh, while I remember... yes... ...would you say your name was very common? Common? I mean, would you be likely to have relations asking after you? I don't think so - we only have one relative... Ellen! Perhaps you'd better explain? Well, it's this bit I come across in the newspaper... ...in the Times it was. There you are: "Isit". I often get very nice bargains in the For Sale column. Isit... Major Arthur Isit. Last heard of in Madras. Will any person knowing his whereabouts... ...please communicate with Messrs Marx & Timms, solicitors. Lombard Street, London, E.C. Oh, Agnes, it really does sound as if they meant Papa. No. Papa was a colonel. And we haven't any relatives. Oh, what a pity. Oh dear. I thought it might be one of these "you'll hear something to your advantage" things. Come on, George. I'll give you a hand with this. Come on, young feller, there we are. Really, Ellen! Discussing family matters in front of a stranger. But I only... You were going to mention Uncle Ludovic. And you know very well Papa forbade us to ever speak of him. I don't see why. Just because he became an artist. If Papa disliked him so much there must have been something very unpleasant about him. Well, I'm going now. Let me know when you're ready to sell that piano. Oh, by the way... ...I should do something about that advertisement. You never know - there might be something in it for you. 400,000 lire... ...an income in English money of roughly ?800 a year. Together with a villa and considerable lands containing vineyards and olive groves. You mean it's all ours? As the sole surviving relatives of the late Mr. Ludovic Vaughan... ...you two ladies inherit the whole estate. Oh, my! And is the property in good repair? Excellent, madam. Then it should sell fairly easily. Quite easily, I should imagine. I've never seen a vineyard, or an olive grove. They're much over-rated trees, Ellen. But surely we ought to at least see it first. I'll think it over. Good day, Mr. Timms. Good day, madam. Where exactly is our villa? At Torquorolla - just South of Naples. I stayed there once as a young man. It's very beautiful. A deep blue sea and the sun always shining. ANNOUNCERI Napoli! Napoli! Napoli! Why can't they call it Naples like we do? And this dreadful weather. It is warmer, Agnes. If we wanted rain we could have stayed in North Bromwich. Two porters will be enough. Signorine, welcome to Napoli. You stay at The Splendide of course? We're going on to Torquorolla. You not get there tonight. You stay at The Forum. They stay at The Splendide! The Splendide?! You wish no hot water and dirty sheets? Very good. Very nice. Good evening, Signorine, and welcome. Tu prendi questa valigia tu quest 'altre. Voi prendete queste. Te le Cappelliere. Wait! Might I ask who you are? But I am Salvatore. The butler of the Castello Inglese. The Major Domo of the Don Ludovico, your uncle. I see to everything. Come. Siguertemi. Welcome to the Castello Inglese, Signorine. A somewhat damp welcome. Ah, but you have come at the time of the Libeccio. It is the wind from the west which brings much rain. But always it stay for two - three days only. Tonight, it is finished... you'll see. I hope so. Sure. Now I introduce you to your servants. This is Carolina - she very good cook. Ben' Venute, Signorine. How do you do? Antonino, he do the garden. Bianca, she help in the kitchen. And Assunta - she help with everything. Assunta, she speak English very well. She learn from the Don Ludovico. He like her very much. And now I show you all the villa. No - not tonight... ...we are both very tired after the journey. We wish to retire. Oh, but you must take some of our famous wine. Via al lavora. It is the wine of the Castello Inglese. It is very good for the stomach. You mean... you mean it's actually made here? Si, si, Signorina. We make it with the feet. With the... feet? Si, si, Signorina. First, we pick the grapes... ...then we put them in the vat... ...and then we trample with our naked feet, so. I hope you wash them first. No, no, Signorina, then it taste from the soap and kill the flavour. I suppose we should accustom ourselves to this, Ellen. It is considered unsafe to drink water abroad. Yes, Agnes. Now, we can retire. Sure, Signorina, I take you to bed, eh? The wine-making we call the Vendemmia. It's in September. You'll see - corking good fun! We shall not be here in September. We're merely looking over the property with a view to selling it. Sell it? You sell the Castello Inglese? As soon as I can arrange it. I see. You think my English OK? I learn it in New York. Oh? This is your room, Signorina Agnes. It was the room of the Don Ludovico himself. He was the most nicest man, your uncle. Fifteen years I'm with him. From a little boy. Never a quarrel. Never an angry word. Which is my sister's room? Oh, it is across. I show. And this is your toiletta. Personal for you both. And very nice bath - also personal. And here, Signorina Ellen, is your bedroom. Well, what do you think of your new home, eh? It's not to be our home. Ah, yes, of course. I forget. Agnes... ...I think we ought to give Waifie a breath of fresh air. Stewart too. I attend to the little animals... ...and when they perform their little duty, I bring them right back. Come on. Come on, little fellow. Come on. This way. One would hardly call him the soul of modesty. No. Still, it may be an advantage to have a man about the house. Goodnight, Ellen. Goodnight. Morning, Waifie. Oh, Waifie. Did you ever see anything so lovely? Buon giorno, Signorina. Buon giorno. Buon giorno. Signorina. Buon giorno, little puss. You have a good sleep, eh? Oh, um, yes. Thank you. You like milk with your coffee? Please. It is of the goat. And the honey is of the flower of the acacia. Sugar, you like? Please. You see? The Libeccio - it is finished, just like I tell you. You no eat? Er, yes. Now I give you the hot bath. Ah, buon giorno, Signorina. You are up already? I prepare the bath for the Signorina Ellen. That is a task for Assunta or Bianca. Yes, Signorina. I bring breakfast in your room now. No. Serve it in the lodge. Oh, but Signorina, you make a big mistake. What is the use of being rich if you don't enjoy the good things. See, you wake up in the morning... ...you see the beautiful sun streaming through your window. Then I bring you your breakfast... ...coffee, crisp hot rolls... ...and the beautiful fruit of Torquorolla. We shall eat downstairs each morning. ...bacon and eggs. For breakfast? But consider the stomach, Signorina. At half past eight. Have you a gong? A gong, Signorina? Surely, you must have used one when my uncle was alive. No, Signorina. The Don Ludovico, he always shout. We shall rely on the gong. You'd better go out through that door... ...Miss Ellen is in bed. Si, Signorina. Good morning, Ellen. Breakfast in bed? I'm surprised at you, Ellen. Papa would never have countenanced anything so slovenly. It is our duty as English women... ...to set an example and not to succumb to these lax foreign ways. To think we lived all those years... ...in the rain and drabness of North Bromwich when all the time... ...this was here. Remember how you nearly came to Italy, on your honeymoon? Years ago when Ben Dench proposed to you in India? I've often wondered why Papa wouldn't let him marry you. He didn't consider Ben socially suitable. I think it was his name that annoyed Papa. I remember him saying... "Dench... ...feller's mad if he thinks a gal of mine's going to go round with a name like that." Think of it... ...you'd have been married all these years and had a family. Papa's judgement was never at fault. In any case it's not a matter I wish to discuss... ...I put all such thoughts away from me when I bowed to Papa's decision. Salvatore! Salvatore... ...will you please serve luncheon promptly at half past one... ...tea at half past four and supper at eight. I shall call each morning at nine to give the cook her orders for the day. Does she speak any English? No, Signorina. She will have to learn. Garlic! Si, si, Signorina. Molto buono. Kindly inform her that garlic is never to be used in future. But, Signorina... Yes, Signorina. I wear them on Sundays. In future you must wear them every day. Let me see your hands. Filthy! Salvatore... ...please see that the kitchen staff keep a high standard of cleanliness. Si, Signorina. Now I would like to see the household accounts. Accounts, Signorina? Ah, yes, accounts. You'd better put them in some kind of order and bring them to me... ...this won't do at all. Won't do, Signorina? But Don Ludovico, he never ask no questions. He leave everything to me. That is not my intention. In future I shall personally superintend the household buying myself. As you say, Signorina. It's not that I doubt your honesty, Salvatore. But I would prefer to look into everything myself. Oh, dear. Ah, there you are, Ellen. Where on earth did you get that dress? I wore it at the garden party at Karachi, do you remember? We are still supposed to be in mourning for Papa. It has got black spots on the band. What, may I ask, have you done to your hair? It seemed such a pity to brush it straight this morning. You have merely made yourself look ridiculous. If you don't take care we shall have you going native. Ah, Signorina. You like the picture? Oh, oh, I was just arranging the curtain and, well, I think you had better put it back again. You see, Signorina? It is I, Salvatore. Don Ludovico say it is his best picture. I think so too, eh'? Are those the accounts? Si, Signorina. We shall have to make many changes in this room... ...have that picture removed at once... ...and be ready to leave with me for the household buying in half an hour. Interesting, very interesting. Miriam! Dear lady... ...I've just had all the latest about the new tenants of Castello Inglese. Oh, tell me everything, Ronnie. Don't miss out a word. Well, it seems they arrived in Naples last night... ...and were driven over by Salvatore in the storm. His nose will be out of joint now, the scamp. So would yours be, dear lady, in the circumstances. Well, never mind about Salvatore. I want to hear about the girls. Well, it seems they are not exactly girls. The eldest is at least thirty-five... ...and the other is about ten years younger. They're both somewhat virginal... ...and they dress in black... ...of a rather indifferent material. You always manage to pick up all the details... ...don't you, Ronnie? It's a gift, dear lady... ...developed through years of practice. Bravo! Bravo! Miriam! There you are, he just said they had bacon for breakfast. And the eggs? I must find out about that. A Cinzano for the Signora Armitage. Ecola Signorina Inglese. A bit on the severe side, isn't she? Ha du dubi su conte di Salvatore. Did you get that? She doesn't like Salvatore's accounts... ...so in future she's going to do all the buying herself. No! Good morning. Buon giorno. I want half a pound of tea one pound of coffee... ...and two pounds of sugar. Si, Signorina. How much is that? Otto lire, eight lire. I will give you six. Va bene, Signorina. Prendi la roba. You see? One must never pay them what they ask. He demanded eight lire and I got the articles for six. Si, Signorina... ...I would have given him four. Buon giorno. Good morning. How do you do, Miss Isit? I intended leaving cards... ...but this meeting has been an unexpected pleasure. Allow me to introduce Ronald Sanctuary... ...and I am Mrs Armitage. How do you do? Hello, Salvatore. Buon giorno. The Barone was the most greatest friend of Don Ludovico, Signorina. Barone? No, dear lady. These smiling people call me that... ...because I happen to be the heir presumptive of the ninth Earl of Chadminster. Are you settling down here for good? Indeed, no. We are only here for a few weeks. For a few weeks? In Torquorolla? Dear lady... ...I came to lunch and I've stayed for life. If you will excuse me, I must continue with my shopping. A determined woman. I'm afraid Salvatore's wings are permanently clipped. Considering how old Ludovic always talked about leaving the villa to him... ...I must say he's taking it very well. The Barone, he what you call a "remittance man"... ...he uses family name to live in credit... ...and he never pay. I see. And Mrs. Armitage? Oh, she very rich with many servants. The Signora will never consider expense and look at the bill. Many times she tempt me to go to her with high wages. And why didn't you? Signorina... ...am I not attached to the Castello Inglese? There is loyalty. Thank you, Salvatore. But it's nothing. Am I not here to protect my Signorina? You ought to be ashamed of yourself. An English tabby like you... ...being out as late as this. You don't suppose he's picked up something from those other village cats, do you? Come in. Scusi. The mail has come. A cartalina postale. What a strange time for a delivery. In the afternoon, the postman, he sleep. He like better to do his work at night. The Piazza, North Bromwich. It hasn't changed a bit. It's not as beautiful as Torquoralla, eh'? Whoever is it from? It's a Mr. Higgins, he want to buy your piano. Thank you, Salvatore. He think you not go back, eh? Agnes. Our return tickets expire at the end of the month... ...we shall have to go then. I don't see why you should jump to that conclusion. Agnes! I made inquiries and I found it's possible to get a refund. Oh, Agnes... how wonderful. Come on Waifie, we're going to stay. Buon giorno, Signorina. Isn't it a lovely day? Magnifica! Buon giorno. Why you let her go? I can't bear to see the way you trap them. But the quail? You like to eat, Signorina. Yes, but to use other quails as decoys - it seems so heartless. It's the fastened bird which make the mating call. All night she cry... ...and those that fly in from the sea, they say... ...this is good luck. Here are the females and now we have corking good time. That only makes it seem even more cruel. I don't understand this "cruel". This is not Christians - they are just the birds. Only twice a year the quail come here and... ...we got to be quick and catch them how we can. I'd much rather you let the poor things go. The Signorina is soft-hearted. Just like Americans. All foreign ladies the same. Like little children all their lives. Now the girl of Torquorolla, she different. At fifteen she become woman... ...at seventeen maybe she marry, have many children... ...one every year. Then she grow fat as the pig or lean as the anchovy, ...and at thirty: finito. Only fit to work in the campania or cook the macaroni. I see. But the English Miss, she very different. Their bodies, their legs, they stay young. What we call appetizers. I see. And it is so with you, Signorina. Every day you grow more young. When I see you walk I say "There goes a young..." how we say... ..."unmarried maiden." Oh, you must not walk so quick, Signorina. Now both the Signorinas have had to rely on the strong arms of Salvatore. That is good, eh? We'll be late for breakfast. No, no, plenty of time... ...you not hurt these little legs, I think? I'm quite alright... thank you. Did Signorina see us? She not like... I think. Good morning, Agnes. Morning. Buon giorno, Signorina. Aren't you well, Agnes? Why do you ask that? I was afraid the heat might be starting one of your headaches. I've never felt better in my life. I'm glad to say the heat has no effect on me. Agnes... please. I know you're annoyed about seeing me and Salvatore... ...I mean - when he was with me in the garden. You must believe me - it was quite accidental. I was hurrying away from him. Why? I released one of those poor birds he uses as decoys. And he pursued you? No. Of course not. I suppose it was silly of me to behave as I did, but... ...it was the things he said. He meant to be quite respectful, of course. I don't like him, Agnes. He seems so cruel and terribly... masculine about everything. I see. Salvatore. Signorina? Please go into the studio. I have something to say to you. Va bene, Signorina. Signorina... If you please? There is something I wish to explain. There is something I wish you to explain. Si, Signorina. Why the household accounts since I took them over... ...are half as high again as... ...when you did the household buying. Sure, that is easy, Signorina - you are a foreigner. Is that any reason why I should be fleeced? In the piazza they are poor... ...they says "here is a rich foreigner who eats bacon for breakfast and meat every day... ...what difference one soldi, two soldi - a lire, maybe?" But when they see me they say... ..."this is no simple foreigner... ...here is a wiseguy who has been to America and understands everything, so cannot be stung." "Very well", they say. "We make for him the fair prices". - The Signorina laughs? - It's remarkably dishonest, but it is funny. Oto lire - anche troppo. - Grazi, Signor. - Prego. Veni, Bianca. - Scusi, Signorina. - Non fa niente. Hello, Salvatore. Out alone? Your mistress isn't ill, I trust? Miss Isit is quite hunky dory, thank you, Barone. Good. Sit down. - Have a drink. Cameriere! - Si senor? It's okay, Barone. You have the drinks on me. Due Vermouth. - Very well. - Far la spesa, Bianca. I see you hold the purse-strings again? You know, Salvatore? I do think you take this like a sportsman. After old Ludo's promises... ...the appearance of these undisclosed heirs must have been a... disappointment... ...to say the least. But is only fair. This is the family. The estate is theirs. It used to belong to your family, and I know how you Italians feel about land. Through them I serve my land, so I am happy. Tell me? Is it true they're going to sell the place? At first they say so... ...but now I... ...I think they not so sure. Ah. The black magic of Torquorolla begins to work, I see. No wonder there are so many feast days in Italy. They love to sing at the slightest provocation. Apparently it's customary to invite the grape-pickers to the house the night before the trampling. So I told Salvatore he might. It's strange what gusto he has for this Vendemmia... ...or anything to do with the land. It seems unusual in a servant. I think that remark most uncalled for. It was only by chance that he let slip the fact the other day... ...that his ancestors, the Ferraros, ...were once the biggest land-owners in Torquorolla. They even owned the land this house is built on. They were Counts, it seems. The title lapsed over a hundred years ago. You've only to go out with him shopping to see how the people respect him. And I think we should do the same. People who've come down in the world... ...through no fault of their own should not be despised. I didn't mean to despise him. It's only... ...well, you told me yourself: we ought to be more cautious of foreigners. Let me remind you, Ellen, that we are the foreigners here. Italy isn't a British possession like India. That reminds me - talking of India... ...we may be having a visitor soon. It's from Ben Dench. He's attending some medical conference in Naples and has heard of our inheritance. It's funny he should write after all these years. I don't think it's funny. I think it's thrilling. Why? Well, don't you see - he must still be in love with you. Don't be ridiculous, Ellen. He must have put such thoughts away from him years ago. I certainly have. You may have to bring them out again. Wouldn't it be wonderful if you both fell in love again and everything... For a woman of my years to fall in love - it's... it's indecent. Goodnight, Ellen. Assunta! Will you kindly explain? Yes - I tell! It is him - it is Salvatore! He make love to me and promise not to look at any other girl. He say he marry me! He make me believe him. - And now, when I am in the big trouble, he... - Stop! Is this true, Salvatore? But of course not, Signorina. Is it to be believed that I, Salvatore, will soil myself with such trash? She mad - she try to blackmail me. She try to spoil the good name of Salvatore. It isn't true! He promised to marry me! But now you in love with another woman. Assunta, you will go to your room. After what has happened, you cannot stay here. You will leave in the morning. But Signorina! It is him - he is wicked! Go to your room. Are you in love with another woman? Yes, Signorina. Who? You really want I should tell you? No! After what has happened, you cannot stay here. Brava! Here is a true daughter of Torquorolla. You're not tired, Signorina? I've never been so happy in all my life. Sure. This is the most happiest time of the year. Ah, Signorina. You also come to help? No. And I see no need for my sister helping. But... Signorina - you will not miss tonight? - Tonight? - The treading of the grape into the new wine. I think I shall retire to my room. I feel one of my headaches coming on. Thank you, Salvatore. With the old vintage, we drink to the new. Now we start the treading. Signorina - you help tread the grapes, yes? No... I don't think so, thank you. Hear what they say? It is bad luck not to tread a grape. Oh... n-no. Well, perhaps. Brava. You have good luck for the year now. I take off your shoes. Thank you, Salvatore. I can manage. Now, Signorina - lift your dress up not to stain it. When I get into the vat. Salvatore! Ah, Signorina. You come down to honour our little festival? Music, Giuseppe - avanti! Salvatore. Morning! Buon giorno, Signor. I'm, er, looking for the Miss Isits. Vendrai studio. Thank you. You... you're not Ellen? I am, and you're Ben. Agnes showed me your letter. Heavens! The last time I saw you, you were just a little girl in pigtails! It's wonderful. And now you're a famous doctor. How well you've done. May I congratulate you on your knighthood? Oh, that... they had to give it to someone. Well, um... ...where's this sister of yours? - She's not here, Ben. - Oh? When I came down this morning... ...I heard that she'd gone into Naples. There's nothing very tragic about that. I know, but it's so unlike Agnes to go away without saying a word to anyone. Of course, if she'd remembered you were coming... I'm the kind of man that women invariably forget. I suppose I shall just have to put up with you. Now that you are here, I do hope you'll be staying some time? I'm going back to London on Thursday. So I expect you to devote the next two days entirely to me. Agnes will be back by tomorrow. Well, then, let's concentrate on today. I hear they're running a horse-brake trip to Almafino. Five lire - including English tea. What do you say? Oh, well, I don't think that Agnes would... Commander Potter says they're turning this place into a sort of Tripper's Paradise. And a good thing too. I'll give you ten minutes to put your hat on. Hmm. Now run along. Isn't this lovely? I'm sure even Agnes would have enjoyed this. "Even Agnes"?! Uh... er, oh no, even though she disapproves... of course she'd have liked it with you, Ben. From what I remember, she was never quite the open-air girl. I don't know about you but I'm ready for my English tea. I've never seen so many sardines in my life. I'll bet till now you thought they grew in tins. Oh, Ben - this is fun. You wait - I've got something even more sumptuous fixed for tomorrow. Ben...? You couldn't stay until tomorrow? No, I'm afraid not. I've stayed an extra day already. Agnes will be terribly disappointed. Tell me, Ellen - have you enjoyed the last three days? Oh, yes. I've never been so happy. Nor I. We could go on enjoying things together, you know? Ben! There's nothing to be frightened of- I love you, Ellen. But you mustn't say that to me. Agnes is my sister - it's her your fond of. That was a long time ago, Ellen. I admit, when I heard you were both out here I wanted to see her again. Just for old times' sake - then I met you. And found you'd grown into the woman I'd been longing for all my life. Oh, Ben. I think... ...I'm sure that you feel something very real for me, too. No... I like being with you because... ...well I... thought perhaps you might... ...fall in love with Agnes again... ...and I wanted to help you. You have helped me. You've made me hate the thought of life without you. No. We must think of Agnes. Why must we? Because... Ben... ...I can remember even now how upset Agnes was when you weren't allowed to marry. She hasn't married since. I couldn't take you from her. Oh, don't be such a little fool, Ellen. I haven't seen Agnes for years. I wouldn't even recognise her if I did see her. As for marrying her, well I wouldn't... ...if she were the last woman on earth. That's horrid of you. I don't know how I ever thought I liked you. I wish I'd never seen you again! Ellen! Ava nti! Si, Signore. Salvatore! - Buona Serra, Signorina. - Buona Serra. Is my sister back yet from Naples? Si, Signorina, we come this afternoon. I was so worried about her. I'd almost told Mrs Armitage we wouldn't be at her party tonight. Ah, the Signorina Agnes... ...she go to many shops... ...also she buy you a new dress for this party. How very kind of her. Buona Serra, Ellen. Agnes! - Magnifica! - You look beautiful. Just like a bride. Thank you, dear. Thank you, Salvatore. They're exquisite. When the Armitage see this dress I think she destroy herself from jealousy. Now I go and see for the carriage. I decided to come out of mourning. Salvatore helped me choose it. He has such good taste. - If only Ben could have seen you. - Ben? Yes - he's been here... ...he stayed as long as he could. He... he was sorry to have missed you. Was he? You'd better hurry and change. I hope you like your new gown. I've laid it out on the bed. I saw the two of them out driving... ...they looked terrible frumps... That's not the end of it, my dear Marchesa... ...the other day, it seems our Salvatore took the two girls down to the Municipio... ...and succeeded in passing off the arms over the gateway as those of his own family - the Ferraros. Innocent spinsters aren't safe with such a man. I expect the armour of their respectability will protect them. Oh, don't you believe it! We Northerners are very like icebergs... ...the greater part of our nature is submerged and invisible... ...and once we float into warmer waters we begin to melt... ...and that's when we become a danger to navigation. My dear Ronnie - you're incorrigible. I shan't be able to keep a straight face. If they come in their black silk taffetas, you certainly won't. The Misses Isits. How are you, my dears? How do you do? The icebergs have begun to melt already, I see. You know Ronnie, don't you dear? I expect he's saying disgusting things about us - behind our backs, as usual. But of course, dear lady. Why else was I invited? Presently you must tell me all about that scamp Salvatore. Has he been up to anything outrageous yet? Of course not. He will. Dinner is sewed. Now, you must come into dinner, all of you. Agnes, dear, whatever made you walk out like that? In the middle of dinner! Sssh! not now, please. Nothing was too beastly for that woman to say. At first, she hardly spoke to me. But later on when she'd whipped herself up with champagne... ...she let herself go and showed what was at the bottom of her filthy mind. Agnes, I don't understand. Of course you don't - but I do. Salvatore had already told me how she'd tried to bribe him to go to her... ...by offering him some fantastic wage. That, no doubt, was at the root of her behaviour - jealousy. Since she couldn't have him to herself... ...she was determined to blacken his reputation in my eyes. But how? She said that Salvatore was a man of base character... ...that he'd lived on the earnings of loose women in Naples... ...that he had a police record... ...and had been involved in every kind of disgusting vice. She even dragged Uncle Ludovic into it. - But that's terrible. - Oh, you haven't heard the rest of it. Salvatore was supposed to have blackmailed the American woman who befriended him... ...and to have caused her suicide. Finally, she leered at me and suggested I'd better be careful... ...not to fall in love with Salvatore myself. But that's monstrous! There's nothing monstrous about it... ...it was the first time she spoke the truth. I do love Salvatore. And he loves me. We're going to be married. ...And having passed through the arch of Caligula... ...we come to one of the crowning glories of Pompeii. The Forum itself. It is amazing to think that for almost two thousand years... ...these glorious ruins have remained buried under a sea of lava. Is something the matter, dearest? My new shoe - she pinch like hell. We see enough old stones. We go home now, eh? Whatever you wish, Salvatore. Buon giorno, Carolina. You have come to the Thesalini. Castello Ferarro. - Castello Ferraro. - Si. Buon giorno, Bianca. Oh, and this is Maria, ...we need a new one to wait at the table... ...she not speak English, but she quick to learn. Of course, darling. Agnes. How well you're looking. Salvatore. Buon giorno, Ellena. Oh, it's good to see you again, Ellen, dear. Isn't it a nice thought of Antonino's? He like better to pick the flowers than do the work. I think he go! Oh, but he's such a nice old man. He too old. We have much work to do now. For a long time he let the land go to waste. Oh, I don't think so - the garden looks beautiful. My little Cognata, you are so easily satisfied. I'm sure Salvatore knows best, Ellen. Sure, I know when it is for the land. I bring my cousin, Francesco - he strong like two bullocks. I can see you're going to be very masterful. I think you like it. Agnes! Agnes? Agnes. Agnes. Libeccio - it's started. Isn't it wonderful? Agnes, you've come to bed very early. I'm not feeling at all well. Don't you think you ought to see a doctor? Never had a doctor in my life and I'm certainly not going to call one in now. Ah, the little Ellena is here also. I notice my little one did not eat her supper... ...so I make her beautiful egg flip. My darling. I was just saying, Salvatore... Please don't fuss, Ellen. Goodnight, dear. Goodnight. - Salvatore don't you think... - Buone Serra, Ellena. Goodnight. Then you see we have the beautiful rain which make the vine so sweet - ...and the olive to swell. - Yes. And it was at this time of the Libeccio, a year ago... ...that I first see my beautiful wife. And now... I make soft music while you drink your egg flip, ...and then you will have beautiful sleep. Ah, my little pigeon. You see, Cara, how the Castello Ferraro live up to its name? You're working wonders, darling. No. No - it's this land we have. This land of the Ferraros that will work the wonders. Soon, we have cleared all the terrace. Oh, but you mustn't destroy all the flowers. Mustn't? Who say I mustn't? You think we grow fat looking at the flowers? You silly little soft heart Cognata, don't talk so foolish. Now, you have a nice drive - do you good... ...and Salvatore go back to work for you. Is the piano annoying you, dear? No, no, no. Go on, little sister. There, you must be very tired. My little wife, she always think of Salvatore. I'm - I think I'll go to bed now. At nine o'clock? No, you stay and keep Agnes good company. You're not going out? I fear, yes. It is about this land I try to buy for you. Salvatore? Yes. Try not to be too late. No, I return on wings. Don't worry, darling. Please go to bed, Ellen. Don't wait on my account. Do you think you should wait up for him? - He didn't get back till two o'clock... - I shall do as I think fit, Ellen. Goodnight. Goodnight. Animale! Hello, Salvatore. Ah, Barone. You have a game? Oh, no thanks. Billiards isn't much in my line, I'm afraid. Come and have a drink. No, the drinks are on me. Well, if you insist. Una Strega. I hope your wife's better. Who say she not well? Oh, I heard in the village. Oh, it is nothing. A touch of the sun, perhaps. I'll give myself the pleasure of calling on her one day, if I may? No, Ronnie. You are getting old man, I... I think the hill is getting too steep. It's quite obvious that I don't need to climb the hill to be insulted. Ronnie, you are a clever fellow. When I first marry Agnes, you English people ignore us... ...now we ignore you. We not want callers. I understand perfectly. Goodnight. Drinks for everybody. What was she saying, dearest? Oh, I tell her to be more cheerful. She too sulky. But she always seemed such a willing girl. She has been rather depressed lately. Perhaps she's not well? There is no time for servants that not feel well. If she not careful, she go. But... Salvatore knows best, Ellen. The old Carolina, I think she go too. Darling, you've always said how well she cooks. Also, I see the food which go out the back door to feed her family. Better we have honest woman. I bring my mother - she beautiful cook! Won't it be rather awkward having your mother as a cook'? No worry. She my mother, but she ignorant old woman - she no mind. Now I see to the land. Salvatore! Don't worry... it's only for a moment. You see! She does need a doctor. My poor little one, you have exhausted yourself. Better you go lie down and rest, huh? No worry. I'm sorry to be such a nuisance, Salvatore. I'm so sorry. There, there... soon you will be well and strong again. Oh, don't cry, mia cara, I can't bear to see you in tears. You must laugh instead - for this way you will get well again. You know, I... I don't like to say this... ...but I think perhaps it is the little Ellen... ...she fuss you. It's better she go. Go? I like the little Cognata, I'm very fond of her but... ...well, it's not only that she fuss... ...when a man has a wife, it's only natural that he wish for the solitaire. To be alone with her. I... I don't wish to be unkind to the little Ellen. I think perhaps we give her the house in the North of Bromwich, eh? That's the last thing in the world Ellen would consent to. Consent'? I not talk of consent. I say she go from here. It is better so. But I can't turn her out of her own house. Her own house? It's as much hers as mine. What do you mean? We inherited Uncle Ludovic's estate equally. You've always known that, surely? But... but it's you who give all the orders. You are the oldest one. - In England it is the law that the oldest one... - Only in the case of sons. I see. I... I did not understand. - Of course, if you'd like me to talk to Ellen I'm sure... - No! No, no of course not. If she have half, it is correct she stay. It was... how I did not know. Just I did not want to share my little pigeon with anyone else. Ellena. Now Agnes is sleeping peaceful. In two, three days she better. I hope so. Ah, you tend your flowers. I like. There's much I like about you, little Cognata. But sometime I... I think you no like Salvatore. It make you unhappy perhaps because I tear up the garden. You know what I do? I give you back one terrace for you personal and all the flowers you wish. What you say? Well, I had missed the flowers. Then you shall have them once more. Also perhaps you like the old Anotonino back, eh? Oh, yes, I would. You leave to Salvatore. I fix. Thank you. Ah, no, do not thank. All I wish is that little Cognata be happy here... ...and not want to go away. Oh, Agnes - it's wonderful to see you up again. How do you feel? Much better, darling. Sure, she better. I tell you, my little one... ...she just eat something which disagree. It is well known that all foreigners are weak in the stomach. My legs still feel a little weak. ...Salvatore shall be your legs. You come to see what we do with the land, eh? Come... I show. You see how we cut off the good-for-nothing? We make less leave, more olive. And so more money to buy more land. You and your land. Sure... me and my land. I love it best in the world. After my wife. One day... I buy the next villa, also the little farm... and then I have all the land of the Ferraro again. Then, you know what? No. Then we ask back our title. How you like to be Countess Ferraro, eh? I don't think I'd mind. Right... now we go eat. I'm afraid I don't feel much like food. But Salvatore make you beautiful egg flip. Yes... from the egg of the seagull, which you like so much. Good morning, Miss Isit. You doing the shopping now? I suppose Salvatore's too grand now he's master of the Castello Ferraro. Oh... no, it isn't that... only, my sister isn't at all well and he's looking after her. Oh... still seedy is she? I'm so sorry. Nothing serious, I hope. She finds it difficult to walk. Salvatore has been so kind to her. Her legs, eh? Curious. That's exactly the way it took old Uncle Ludo. Oh, well... I don't suppose it's anything. Only somehow I can't quite see Salvatore in the role of ministering angel. Ah... my little one, I bring you the egg flip to make you strong again. I don't think I really want... Oh, you'll not disappoint your Salvatore? - But... - After the big risks he take to get the eggs from the cliff top. Oh... Salvatore, if it's dangerous please don't. Nothing's too dangerous, if it be for my Agnes. Now you drink it. Afterwards, I have big surprise for you. No, no... you finish. Come on. That's it. Now we go downstairs. - But my legs feel so weak. - Then I take you. Come on. What is your surprise, Salvatore? No, you must wait. I not tell. - Oh, please. - No! Now we show the little sister how you are better. Agnes! How lovely. Brava, little pigeon. See how well and strong you grow. Now, my surprise please. There. From this bed you can watch your Salvatore work in the gardens. And then when the sun shines, I wheel you out in this chair. Come, you try? For many days I worry... ...with poor little Agnes up in the big bedroom all alone. And then I remember the chair of the Uncle Ludo. That was Uncle Ludo's chair? Of course... and for the last summer he have his bed here too. It was sweet of you to think of it, darling. I did find the stairs rather a trial. You know... ...I begin to see things clear now. This sickness is the rheumatism, exact the same as Uncle Ludo... ...it is a thing of the family, non dubitare! But... Uncle Ludo didn't get better. Oh, Uncle Ludo an old man. You not die, my beloved one. Salvatore not let you. There, you comfortable? Beautifully. You know, Papa suffered from rheumatism. Perhaps Salvatore is right'? I seem to have inherited it on both sides of the family. But now we know, there is no worry. Today I go get you the good medicine the pharmacist make for Uncle Ludo. Then we see big improvement. I still think she ought to see a doctor. No, Ellen. I won't hear of it. Salvatore, get me the medicine. Agnes, clear. I do wish you'd stop taking this horrible stuff. I believe it's doing me good. Salvatore... was saying how well I was looking. The man who prescribed it for you hasn't even seen you. Supposing I get an English doctor? There must be one in Naples. Signor Salvatore send you these flowers. That's very sweet of him. Thank you, Gita... Grazie tanto. I'm afraid Salvatore has had to dismiss Maria. Some brute of a man has got her into trouble. Oh! This new girl Gita seems quite nice. Salvatore chose her for me... ...because she speaks a little English. It's very thoughtful of him. Agnes. Doesn't it seem to you rather strange that... There, there darling. It'll be over soon. Ah, the little Cognata. Salvatore, Agnes has got to see a doctor. Again you say? You know well Agnes will not have doctor. I know perfectly well she'd do anything you tell her to. The doctor here is no good - I tell you, he drink. Then why not get her an English doctor from Naples? Why do you say all of this nonsense? What do you think I am? A god, perhaps, to force Agnes to do something she do not want? She tell me herself it is you with your worrying that make her not well. You come between husband and wife. That's a fine thing, I tell you! Now you shut your damn mouth. You understand? Ah. What do I say? It's this worry I have. You think I not broken-hearted for my little wife? Always a thump in my head. My poor Agnes. My poor Agnes. There, there Salvatore. I'm sure it'll be alright. Only, you see Agnes is very ill. The little Cognata is always most simpatica... ...if anything happen to my Agnes... ...you'll not fly away from Salvatore, eh? Anything happen? Well, Uncle Ludo... he ill the same way. And we must admit he die. It's of the blood, you see? Salvatore, let me go. You stay with me? - Let me go! - Do not leave me broken heart, eh'? Signorina! Signore! What is it Gita? Tell me in English. Stewart the little dog. He fall every time he try to walk. - Oh dear, where is he? - By the loggia. Stewart... what's the matter? We are too late. I often see dogs die this way. It is the sun, he take a fit. But he's never had a fit in all his life. He seemed so well this morning. I wonder if he could have picked up something that was poisonous? Poison? Why you always think such things? Again you worry my poor Agnes with your bad suspicions... ...you say nothing, you hear? It is, it is better I tell Agnes. It is my duty. You stay here. Oh, Signorina, per favore. Medico. What is it the matter? You look upset. You talk English. Oh, thank heavens for that. Look, you can help me. I must have the address of the English doctor in Naples. Letta me think... I notta know... the English doctor in Napoli. Why Naples? There's one in Torquorolla! Ben! Oh, Ben! Agnes... Agnes... Agnes! Hello... darling. Hello... I've brought somebody to see you. - Ben! - Hello, Agnes. It's good to see you again after all these years. Ellen told me about your last visit. I'm sorry I missed you. Why are you taking my pulse, Ben? Force of habit! It's alright, though... ...a little slow, perhaps - but nothing to worry about. Ben has just asked me to marry him. Darling, I'm so glad. But what a surprise! You're a lucky man, Ben. I hope you make her as... ...happy as my husband has made me. I hope I will make her even happier. Does this do you any good? She thought so at first, but the last few doses seem to burn her throat. Everything seems to burn my throat. Hmm. Get me a glass of water and a dessert spoon will you, Ellen? Salvatore Ferraro? Yes. Who are you? I'm an old friend of your wife's. I've just come from seeing her. You see Agnes? Who say you can see my wife? Now, I happen to be a doctor. Everything seems to burn my throat. Very serious indeed! Though it can be cured. Ah, that is good. That make me very happy. Yes, I thought it would. But first we must ascertain the cause. Oh, yes. It is just a thing of the family. My old master, the Uncle Ludovico - he just the same. So I understand. And, urn... he died. Well... he an old man. We must all die. I've just come from examining your wife. Her condition is associated with specific poisons in the blood stream. Such as the toxins of diptheria or enteric fever. Ah, that can explain. I'm afraid not. There are absolutely no confirming symptoms. There could be other causes. Erm... excessive alcohol's the most common. The Castello Inglese wine, it is well known fact it is very strong. Hmm. But she'd have to drink ten gallons a day to produce that condition. So we're left with the... metallic poisons. Lead, and, um... arsenic. You'll be pleased to hear there are absolutely no signs of lead poisoning. So there's just, uh... arsenic. Of course, if that's present, laboratory tests... ...samples of the system will soon prove it. However, if you do what I tell you, I can guarantee her complete recovery. Anything. You just need to ask. Good! Now, you and Agnes have been seeing too much of each other. What she needs is complete isolation. You must go on... what shall we call it...? A holiday? I suggest America. But... but the Signor is joking. Here is my home. This is my land and my life. It is a thing not heard of to separate a man from wife. Mr. Ferraro. I know what you have been doing. You've been coldly and deliberately poisoning your wife. But I'm a doctor, and my duty is to save life - my patient's life. If I were to hand you over to justice, the result on her might be fatal. Therefore I suggest that you... disappear. And, er... what if I refuse to go? You'll have a lot to tell the police. They'll have a sample of Agnes's food... ...and this... by tomorrow. Signor doctore is very clever. He think he know everything, huh? Come on! I've beaten bigger men than you. Not that way, my friend. You'll be out of Torquorolla by tonight. And don't try and see your wife. No, please, Doctor - I only do what is right. ...this is my land! Ferraro land. And these women steal it from me. All I do is try to get back what is mine. I'll give you four hours. No, please, Doctor - listen to me... ...we make a bargain. I have money I'll pay you. But don't take my land from me. For me it is the life - without it I have nothing. It is better I am dead! Doctor! Doctor! Please come back. I make things good for you. Doctor! Oh, la mia terra... La terra dei Ferraro... Perche? Perche? Non e giusto! Non e giusto! Non e giusto! Well, that's a bit better. I mended your coat. Thank you, my dear. Signorina, Signorina. Salvatore, Signor Ferraro... he is dead! Oh, poor Agnes. How did it happen'? He fall from the cliff. When he get the egg of the sea bird. For the Signora. Look, they bring him now. SALVATORE! Arrivederci, Francesco. Arrivederci, Signora. Agnes. I do hope you'll soon come and stay with us in Delhi? Thank you, Ellen. But I shall never leave here. I have Salvatore's work to carry on... there's nothing more I want. Soon I shall be able to buy the next villa. Next year the little farm, perhaps. Then I'll have it all. All our land again. That'll be marvellous, Agnes. Goodbye, darling. Goodbye, Ellen. I know you'll be very happy. You never knew my husband, did you, Ben? Um... No. There was nobody in the world like him. So loving. So gentle, and yet so strong. He was a wonderful man. And a perfect husband. I'm sure he was. Goodbye, my dear. Goodbye.
