You want some more? No... Thank you... Thank you for sparing time to fight with me. What are you fighting for? Who joined the fight? They did, I arrested them for you.

Why didn't he see me the Central Primary School? how dare he offend me? Go tell the Governor. Say he's been robbing. And cut his head off. Yes, Master! Master, I've heard many gossip about us. So what? Should I be scared? Of course not, master. But, there is an old Chinese saying that, you should follow the rules of the village which you have entered. If we want to establish our power in Canton. We should mix with the people. How? I have an idea. If we want to make a name, and establish power here, let's arrange for a kung-fu competition to select a son-in-law for you. It's not fair to Ting Ting. Master, you should be decisive. The daughter would marry anyway. She will leave your family and change her surname. She won't remember her parents. Please consider. Did your father and mother-in-law... gain any benefits from you? Damn it, what you said is just what I have in mind. I was about to propose it. It's very wise of you, master. It's a deal! Get Ting a husband with a Kung-fu competition. Sai Yuk, we should never tell others that, we've been caught. Right, if you dad knows that, that'd be troublesome! Don't worry, I wrote us false names. You are called Yuen Kwei. You are called Lau Chun Wai. How about you? I am Wong... Jing1 Well, I have to go home now. Or my mom would teach me a lesson. Come around if you have time. Bye-bye! Yuk! Her curly hair is cute! his dark glasses are funny too! Isn't it black now? Shit! Nothing can be seen, but it's smart! She is blind! Miss! You scared me! You look good! Your voice is sexy! Are you selling cloth? Bull shit! What kind of cloth... would you like? The one outside! That one? I won't give it a damn. Right, this one. This one? Yes! How many yards do you want? I want... That much! No, less... - So much? - No, here... - Here? - No, just that much, - Here? - Yes. That little! For wrapping a dumpling? How dare you steal? You bastard... Shut up! No! Mom, that... Be polite! It hurts! Mom, you are pretty. Shut up, give me the weight-measure, Yes, mom. What for! Our cloth is not measured by yards. It's measured by weight. Otherwise you won't take so much! Aren't you blind? You are blind. You thought I hit you by chance? That shows I'm not in your good grace. I am leaving. You wanna escape? This is for you. Mom, we're in trouble! Don't worry, 2 cm to the mark. Really? No blood, no blood please! Mom, you're wrong! It's 6 mm to the mark, look! They have deep throat! He deserves it! I'm in a good mod, let's take the afternoon off. You took a day off yesterday because you were in a bad mood. You want to rest today because of good mood? Sure, your dad is coming back today. I can't concentrate. Make it a day-off. Mom! Mom, I met a very pretty girl today. She has character. Then, let's take an extra holiday the day after tomorrow. Another day off? Young master. Young master, bad news! What's the matter? The Governor has come. He is talking with Master. What is it? If fought with someone today. Don't panic, there's always your mom. Your Excellency, death friends, You can be sure I will do the right thing. Yes, Master Fong is such a righteous man. I feel shame! I assure you I will punish... So many friends! Hello everybody. No matter what had happened, l, Miu Tsui Fa will be responsible. Of course you should be responsible. You, you beat that foreigner up. And the cloth you sold me... last time was stinky. She insulted my wife, saying that she was fat. And refused to sell her cloth. She teased me! Saying that I'm as stupid as a pig. She is too much! What's your explanation? I would not have come back if I knew I had to face this. Macu, get the cane. What? Not again! Master, for my sake... For you sake? Never mind. Dad, please forgive mom! Please hit me instead. Look at our son! He is nice. Is it the Fong family? Oh, you are Fong Sai Yuk, not Wong Jing! Why do you call yourself Wong Jing? He was caught fighting this morning and, in the police station he claimed to be Wong Jing. you little scoundrel! Are you hurt? Yes! I shielded you from most of your blows, so don't cry for pain. Mom, since you are so good at Kung-fu! But you just let dad beat you up. I should give him some face in front of other people. The status of a man in a family is very precious and important. Yes, it's precious and important indeed. Get some sleep now! Yes, dad. I don't know how you teach your son! He's a grown-up, but just loiters around involving in fights. Kids should be independent. All you care about is your business. if our son don't keep me company, who would? You listen to these gossiping fools. And best me up in front of everybody. You don't treat me as your wife at all. Listen to me. I won't. Listen to me. No, I won't... "The beauty put up the curtain." Oh God! He is reciting poetry again. "And sits moody with furrowed brows." "We only see stains of her tears." "No one knows who she is hating." I can't stand it! He is too smart! Too Romantic! So great! Every time he recites poetry I'm so excited. I feel dizzy! Am I wrong to scold you like this? No! Now why don't you come to bed? Yes! "Our Fist conquers the whole of Canton." "Our Kick subdues Soochow and Hangchau." What kind of bluffing is it? Master, how is my writing? Once it is hung out, See, so many people are gathered around it. Ting Ting... I don't want to select my husband through the kung-fu competition. Stop bothering me. If you force me, I will run away. Shut up, or I will beat you to death. - Damn it! - Maybe you should... ...deal with Ting Ting in gentler way. When I am talking, you shut up. I do this to impress the local people. If I don't get better status here. Do you understand? Why are you laughing? I am not play acting! Damn it! Can you stand it? Sure! I can still stand it. Really? - Alright. I'll try again. - Sure. Son, does it work? What's wrong? Isn't it alright? It's like barbecue! Sure, I saw foreigners do this. Do this to my eyebrow later, alright? Sure, anywhere can do. It's awful! Would your dad like and recite poem to me? He will love it! May be he will recite an English poem. English poem? May be, I would be more excited. How is English poem? I know, say, "Wonderful..." How do you know it? I am taught by Josephine Siao. Sai Yuk... Hurry up, your dad is back. Quick! Shit! My hubby! What are you doing? Honey, don't come in. I want to show you something nice.

Brother Lui. What's up? The people outside are all furious. I heard... that the Governor of Kau Mun will come soon. Your Honour, you should help me. Get your son-in-law... to get married in front of the people, saying that he is willing to do so. Then, we won't have any problem if the Governor comes. Okay, I'll force him to say he's willing.

What did you come for? In fact, our situations are the same. I was taken as Tiger's maid at 12. I have been his concubine since I was 16. I am the same as you. I have had no romance before marriage. How come? You are happy at least, you are willing to marry him. I am forced to do so. These 20 years, I think I am happy. I married a rich husband, and have a good daughter. After seeing your brother on stage. I realize that I am cheating myself. Actually, I need... What do you need? Love! What! You are fond of my brother? I know he is alive. If you see you brother again. Please give this letter to him. Aren't you afraid of Tiger Lui? For love, I fear nothing. Mom, you are great! You've won a girl's heart. Actually, my brother is... I know you are better than your brother. Oh, it's you! What do you want? Nothing, I just want you to know that, l, Tiger Lui is a man of virtuous persuasion. I don't want to make you to be my son-in-law by force. We should explore each other's merits. Maybe, we shall find we have many common interests. Common interests? - Right! - Really? I won't be angry. Virtuous persuasion. Virtuous persuasion. Virtuous persuasion. Why is it so noisy? I want to be a man of virtuous persuasion. "I pracise singing early in the morning" "Beat the drum" "Singing can help me to win a wife" "It's great" "Where's your mother?"

Ask your fellow to leave me alone. So they can't hear our talk. Fine. 1, 2, 3, 4, go back. Hurry up! - Tai Yuk! - Don't come over. I am afraid I can't accept you love. Since I received your letter, I have been suffering thinking of you. I can't stand it any longer. So I come to see you now. "The beauty put up the curtain." "She sits with furrowed brows." "One sees only the stain of tears." "Who is it that she hates?" Madam, this poem is specially written for you. He knows how to write a poem! There is noise. Madam, I have to go now. See you later. Tai Yuk! Madam, what's the matter? Nothing, why are you here? Who asked you to come here? It's wise to leave now. It's you? It's me! You?! It's you! Miss Chan, have you also been kidnapped by Tiger Lui? Yes, how about you? Me too! I tried to find you in the Playfield afterwards. Me too! I waited for a long time. You didn't come, so I left. You mean you were waiting for me? She waited for me! Do you want this gold medal? You always take this along with you? I heard noise over there. - Did you find anyone? - Nothing! I am afraid, I have to go. Watch out, there are dogs. If I leave like this, I can never seen Miss Chan again. Fong Sai Yuk is here, come and get him. Fong Sai Yuk is here, come! The purpose of my visit, is to destroy the rebels of the Red Flower Society. I have got a clue that, they'll appear in this town. I hope, once you get any information about the rebels, come and inform me right away. Yes, Sir! Don't worry, I will try me best. My heart is devoted to the Court. Please take note of my efforts. Help me! What? My husband returned from town yesterday. He did not see his son and got angry with me. He punished me. Look, he beat me up. He burnt my hand. Alas! Poor me! None of my business! I just want you... to let Sai Yuk meet his dad, just one day will do, one day only. If Mr. Fong really misses his son, he may come and visit him. Or, come and live here... for as long as you like. You are too cruel. Well, I will kill myself in front of you. Where is the wall? Where is the wall? Don't do that! Master, just let Sai Yuk come back for one day. I don't believe she will bump her head against the wall. Let her try. I'm sure she won't. Okay, I will die in front of you. Tai Yuk... Tai Yuk...? - Tai Yuk, mom is going to die. - Don't... - Tai Yuk, mom is going to die. - Master, you are man of virtuous persuasion, aren't you? Don't! A man of virtuous persuasion, right! Take him home now, bring him back tomorrow. Thank you. Master is here. Mom, is dad back? It is a lie. Pack up, we are going to look for your dad. Okay! He is back! He has a dark face! Freeze! Why don't tell me about the wedding? How can you be his mom? I left for a few days, and you lostom son. How can I face our ancestors? I... Shut up! It's none of his business. I should be blamed. Any way, I am no good as a wife. I don't know how to teach my son. I can't face you ancestors. Let me die. - Let me die... - Mom. Don't stop me, just where's the wall. Don't! Mom, it's your second time today. Well, I have to do something first. I will go see Tiger Lui tomorrow. I am going to die. Do you want to leave like this? Why don't you save me? You're heartless. This is for you. A razor! It's for me! It's for me to shave my legs. Mom, it's raining. Let's get an umbrella for your dad. Yes! Why is it raining so heavily? Be careful! Get an umbrella. Mom, the rain has stopped. Someone inside. What? Fine, don't cry! Bastard! Mom, don't get angry. I don't want to live anymore. Don't be silly. You are pregnant. They even have a child! Don't worry. I am responsible I will take care of him. We are responsible too. Bitch! So many men too. All are involved. Why should dad take the responsibility alone? If Fourth Brother wasn't trying to save me. Lok Ping wouldn't have lost her husband. And I couldn't bring this list out. Oh, dad is not having a mistress! I am almost scared to death. Mom, don't cry! Who is it? Come out! Don't go! What kind of noise is it? Firecracker! - Firecracker? - Yes! See, you hands are trembling. You don't seem to practise kung-fu. Why did you join the rebels? We work for different bosses. To you, Chien Lung is good emperor, to us, he isn't. If only you hand me the list, you will enjoy a prosperous life forever. For my wealth, I'd be giving up thousands of lives. Even I am willing to do so, my brothers won't let me do it. Even if they are willing, my family won't forgive me. Of course we will forgive you. Where is he? Attack! Dad! To my mind, my dad is kind-hearted man. So, I want to beat you. Let's go! How dare you bully my husband? Go to hell! Mom! Watch mine. Dad, where is the list? Here it is! No-Shadow Hands. What are you doing? Sai Yuk, save Lok Ping. You mom can handle it. Be careful! Miss Lok, how are you? Little hero, help your dad to protect the list. Don't worry, I won't let you down. Good-bye! Take care of yourself. Son, we are leaving, take care of here. Don't worry! How dare you join a secret society! It hurts! Come on! It doesn't hurt! No?! No, not painful indeed? My dad used to hit me like this. I tell you, I used to hit my dog like this. Bastard, an inch longer, an inch stronger. So, mine is short but powerful! Where can you do? See you! Dad! Sai Yuk, are you tailed? Don't worry, I haven't been practising kung-fu in vain. Where is mom? Must have quarreled. Mom, are you alright? He has never treated me that nicely before. He recited 10 poems for me. 10 poems, great! Leave me alone, stop bothering me. Too smart! How romantic! Sai Yuk! Dad has chosen his path, so you and mom would have a hard life from now on. If I am having a good life alone. How about the others? Even I wish to do so, others would object! Even others are willing to do so, how is my feeling then? But if others... and I agree, so what? No matter what, your choice is correct. I will go with you all the way. I don't know what you are talking about, But l, too, will go along. Since you have made up your mind. Let's go to find Lui tomorrow. It's dangerous! The most dangerous place is safest place. I understand! What? You want to move to my home? Right, actually I don't want to do so, but my wife said, you are a man of virtue. Even my naughty son admires you so much. I want to see for myself. So I agreed to come... and live here for a while. To see how righteous are you. I am a man of righteousness. So help yourself. I will let you stay until you admit I am righteous. Miss. Meet your Father and Mother-in-law. Go! Honey, I miss you. But I am not...She is your wife. - It's you! - It's you! You are thin. You are thin too. Your son is really romantic. It may be inherited. Come on. What's the matter? This Mirror is our family treasure. It's a present to you. Thank you mom. Thank you mom. Since all of us are here. Why not take this opportunity, to celebrate their wedding tomorrow. I am sorry... It doesn't matter. I am a man of righteousness. Go ahead, until you think its enough. I don't have any friends in Canton. Why not ask your relatives... to join the wedding party? Can you ask Tai Yuk to come along too? it doesn't matter, I am a man of righteousness. I don't mind that! Great! It doesn't matter. Let's rest now. There will be many guests coming to our party. Let's take a good rest to meet our guests tomorrow. To be a righteous man. Why don't your relatives or friends come? Well, we do have a big family. But they are all over the country doing business. I can't inform them about the party in such a short time. But you do have friends here? Say, friends in the market! Well, my dear father-in-law. We grow the vegetables ourselves, we needn't go to the market. How about rice? We grow our rice too. How about your clients? Aren't they your friends? No, they aren't our friends. If not, I won't sell them bad cloth. Or I charge them with unreasonable prices. Selling cloth is more or less similar to running a brothel. If a client wants to buy, we are willing to sell. It won't do to become affectionate. So, we don't have friends. Am I right? Perfect! Master, the Governor. Finally, a guest! Show him in. Don't panic, just the Governor. The Governor! - Brother Lui. - Your Excellency! His Honour, the Governor of Kau Mun. Your Honour. - This way please. - Welcome... Let's meet our guest together. Come! Your Honour, this way please. Welcome... Your Honour, my son-in-law, and his family. Take a seat, please. This way please. Good-bye! Take a seat! Your Honour! Why are you sitting there? Come and sit with us. No, I think it's too crowded. We'd better sit here. Bull shit, join us. Come on... I dropped my money. Where is it, let me help you. Mister Fong, don't sit alone. Come over... Where is the money? I can't find it. When did you come? I have just come over. What is your son-in-law doing? What are you doing? Get up! The meat you love is coming. Get up! Mom, towards you right. Is he your son-in-law? Mr. Lui, didn't you tell His Honour you are related? Fong Sai Yuk is my son-in-law. So, you are the one in-charged here? Sure, I am the one in-charged here. Give me the list! Husband! Be careful! Siu Wan! Mom! Ting Ting! Where is the name list? I am going to kill you. Mom! Let's fight! Go! Siu Wan... Master, be careful! - Go! - Yes! Take it back! Burn the house. Damn it. You son of a bitch! I marry my daughter to you, but you get my whole family into trouble. Mr. Lui, it's not the fault of young master. Cut the crap, or I will kill you. Let him go, or else... You want to fight? What do you want? Young master, forget it. Dad, mom's hurt bad. Damn! Siu Wan! - Ting Ting! - Mom! Where is your dad? Siu Wan, are you alright? Hurry up... Do you need a doctor? I know what to do. Leave me alone. Don't touch her! No! She is seriously hurt! Siu Wan. Let's go! Be careful! Do you want me... to take you to the doctor? Save the crocodile tears. Let's go our separate way from now on. Dad, don't do that. You are a stranger around here. Are you leaving? If not, you're no longer my daughter. Ting Ting! Go! Go! Go now! Sai Yuk, I feel so lost. Mom, don't worry! While the list is with us. They won't do anything to dad. I am going to town. Be careful! Sing! Who is it? Sai Yuk. open the door now. Come in! I have seen the notice... that my dad would be executed tomorrow. Many people were caught because of us. I come to see whether you are okay. I am fine... What's wrong? Sai Yuk, I am sorry. Sing, what'd happened? Some officer took Bo and me for questioning. I said... I didn't know you. Where is Tai Bo? He said I was a crowed. He refused saying that he didn't know you. So he was beaten up. The officers are tired, they wanted Bo to kau-tow before releasing him. Bo refused. Where is he now? He was beaten to death. And his corpse is hanging at the East Gate. Sai Yuk, forgive me. I am scared. I won't blame you. I lost a friend, I don't want to lose you. Who is it? What are you doing? I came to collect his corpse. Who are you? How dare you? Fong Sai Yuk. Fong Sai Yuk? How dare you come here? My friend is not afraid of death. How can I be a coward? I have come for his corpse. - Attack. - Yes! Bo, let's fight together. Kau-tau 3 times to my friend. Please forgive us. Bo, let's go. Let us go! Bo, you are my best friend. Hope we'd be buddies in our next lives. Young master, don't be so sad. Macu, dad will be executed tomorrow. What? I must to save dad alone. You take mom and leave early tomorrow morning. How can you go alone? It's too dangerous. Enough! I have made up my mind. Never let mom know this. Macu... Don't cry. Let's go back, mom is waiting for us. Do you have any information about your dad? He'll be fine, don't worry. Dad was rescued by Chan, the Head of the Read Flower Society. Really? I won't cheat you. Why didn't he come back? Mr. Chan said, it's not wise to stay together. He'll meet you and Macu at Puishi Beach tomorrow morning. Isn't there a branch of the Red Flower Society at Puishi Beach? You dumb-bell, answer mom now. Right, I went with Old Master a year ago. What about you? Mr. Chan asked me to take this name list to Long Fu Hill. And hand it to a Mister Chiu. Are there any Mister Chiu in Long Fu Hill? Speak up... Right, a year ago, I met him once with Old Master. We dined together. He is a nice guy. Am I right? You are right! Well, I don't have to worry anymore. Go to hell! Damn you Cantonese Bastards! They say they'll fetch me the doctor. But they told officers to come and arrest me. You Cantonese, all are bastards. How are you? Ting Ting... I'm fine. It's pouring get on board first. I won't get on your boat! I warn you, don't come to my side. Dad! Shut up! Ting Ting. She is seriously hurt, why don't you help her to the boat? Ting, go with them! I'll stay here to keep your dad company. Don't be proud at a time like this. Damn it, you've said enough! I said I would not go with you. But I didn't say my family wouldn't. Help her up. Be careful! Take care! Take good care! Take care of here! Take care. My God, what the hell did I do wrong? Why do you treat me like this? The Gods are punishing you for your sins. I ask you once more, are you getting into the boat? No... Hold it! Mom... Sai Yuk, take Ting Ting out for a while. I want to talk with your mother. Go now! Madam, I have one thing to ask you. What's the matter? Where is Tai Yuk? He is back! "The Beauty pulls the curtain up." "She sits with furrowed brows." "One sees the stains of tears." "Who is she crying for?" Madam, it's me. Tai Yuk! Are you Tai Yuk? Yes! Tai Yuk, we can't live together in this life. But we'll be husband and wife in the next life, yes? Fine! Madam! Mom! Siu Wan! Although you scold me all day. I am not angry with you. you'd be my father-in-law now, you'd be my father-in-law for life. When you reach Puishi Beach tomorrow. The officers can never get you. Siu Wan! Siu Wan! After finish your mission, come and join us. Young Master. Take care. Macu, why are you crying? He's just going to deliver the name list. He is not going to die. I have caught a cold. Cut the crap! Hurry up, dad is waiting. Yes! - Sai Yuk! - What's the matter? Can you swear? What? Swear you'd never marry me. Why? Remember our bridal night? What? You swore that if marry me, your family'd... Would all die, I remembered. No matter what happens, I will marry you. My husband used to kiss me like this. Did your wife kiss you like this before? Forget I said anything. Jabber. Wear this! How about you? I have this. - You take this along! - It's time to leave. Take care. Sai Yuk, take care! Take a horse. It's better than walking on foot. Beware of catching cold. Take some food! You take care too. I just want the traitors of the Red Flower Society. Give me the name list, and you will be spared. We Hans won't betray our friends. If only you Manchus go back to Machuria, we won't go against you. The Ching government has ruled over China for generations. But you still refuse to face facts. Look, our country is stable and prosperous! Listen? Shut up! Death to whoever make a noise. I ask you, where are the men of the Red Flower Society? When there is air, there are members of Red Flower Society. How many can you kill? Okay, I will kill as many as I can. Kill him! How poor! Kill! Here is the list! Great! I've become the member of the Red Flower Society! I'll live and die with the list. Sai Yuk! Don't come over. Or I'll kill him! Retreat! You have guts! Aren't you scared? I am prepared to be killed. Give me the name list, and you will be spared. then you and your dad will be released. Sai Yuk, don't give it to him. You should know how the wind blows. Just give me the name list. I can guarantee you a prosperous future. Are you bluffing? My dad won't forgive me, my mom will kill me. The citizens will scold me. History will give me a bad name. I won't betray my people! Great! You have guts, I like your kind. If we are not serving different bosses, we can be friends. I'll give you a chance. If you can defeat me before the rope breaks, I will let you father go. If you lose, give me the name list. I used 30% of my power last time. I think you are so gifted in kung-fu, that I want to introduce you to serve our government. But, I don't think there is a chance now. I know every kinds of boxing. I want to make you my student. Since you bullied my dad... I don't think there is any chance now. Luckily I am protected by the mirror. Go to hell! Take it! Go now! I won't go! Sai Yuk! I am happy to see you so grown up. Just leave me. Our country is waiting for you. I feel at ease even if I have to die. Go now! What I can do, many people can to too. But I have one dad. Sai Yuk, go! Dad, I want to die with you. Fong Sai Yuk, I am coming to help you! I come to help too! Use some force! "Fuck you!" Kill them! Husband! Sai Yuk! Mom is here to save you! You foolish kid. How dare you leave mom alone? I want to help too! Macu, why did you bring mom here? I didn't. There is a branch of the Red Flower Society at the Puishi Beach! What a coincidence. Your big mouth is an oracle. Take care of dad. Go to hell! Go to hell! Why don't you die? Why don't you die? Mister Chan! Husband, are you alright? I am fine, Save dad! Dad! Save dad. Go now! Mister Chan, you are really great. I admire you so much. But, my master said, I have to bring you corpse back. Super shoes! Watch mine! Mom! Brother Fong, I will take Sai Yuk as my God-son. I will train him in Kung-fu too. Thank you, Master Chan. I leave my son to you. Mister Damn! Sorry! Master Chan! Take care of him please! You have never left me since you were a child. Master, we've to say good-bye! God father, may I take Ting Ting with me? Sure you can. Are you willing... to let your son join the triads? What do you think? Fine, just as you say. Ting Ting, let's go. Dad! Sai Yuk, don't bully my daughter. Or, I will beat you. Don't worry, I won't bully her. You should take me as an example. To be a man of virtuous persuasion. Yes Sir! Dad! May I beg you for one thing? What? I've never seen you smile! Can you smile for me once? Make it next year. Sai Yuk, follow me. Dad, you'd take care. Let's go! Sai Yuk, take care! You'll be good to me, won't you? "The beauty put up the curtain." "She sits with furrowed brows." "Only stains of her tears are seen." "Who is she hating?" Son, you dad laughs! How romantic. I am so happy!
