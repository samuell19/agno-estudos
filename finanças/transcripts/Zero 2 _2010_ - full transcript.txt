Haven't heard from you for ages, Sylvester. Have you read the morning newspapers? l don't read newspapers. Just so you know, they found 2 men shot in the chest, shot to hell. So, what do you want from me? l want to get the chink back, with the whole package. l don't deal with this anymore. l was transferred to another department. Send your guys and l guarantee that by dinner time you'll be happy. l do not rely on people who work in a building with slanting windows. l need you, there were cops. Do you hear me? There were cops there. l just don't get it. Why did they have to shoot at my people? l don't want anything, l don't need anything, l want just one thing: to provide for my retirement. l won't let you down, you know me. - When did he disappear? - Yesterday. Drive to Max's, he will tell you more. Max is on holidays. His honeymoon is over, l was talking to him. - What? He got married? - Yes. And collect your toys. Haven't seen you for ages, Sylvester! You are not aging, for fuck's sake, what are you eating? l was born old, Sylvester, l'm only eating young women. - l need two, full. - l know. One for you, one for Max. - Do you see him around here often? - l saw him a while ago. - Did you hear that he got married? -Yeah. - Do you know who his wife is? - No. l never miss an episode with her. A wonderful woman. lf she looks the same as she does on TV, l would eat her with pleasure. l don't watch soap operas. So don't watch soap operas, watch her. Watch and you'll see what l mean. Ok, l'll watch. Sylvester, she likes red roses. This one is also blocked. Nonsense, it was all OK yesterday. Unfortunately, now it's definitely blocked. How much do l have to pay? ln total 83.14. lf l don't take brandy, cigarettes, how much for fuel? Count everything, l'll pay. No, thank you, there is no need, but... l'll just drive home and come back. Don't wory, it's not a problem for me. Please, l'll take these roses too. - Thanks a lot. Thank you. - Not at all. - Thank you. - You are welcome. - l'm Caroline. - Sylvester. Shall we have some coffee? l've got some business to take care of. 10 minutes. We'll drink some coffee, so l don't feel like l owe you. OK. Don't say anything! l'll kill that bitch myself. - Congratulations! - Who is this for? l dunno. Maybe for your wife. For my wife? Are you taking the piss, Sylvester? Fucking look at what l'm wearing! l can't get into my flat 'cause that bitch wouldn't let me in. Have you got a cigarette? Have you been to Bronius? We have to visit Vova. Who's Vova? Vova... Vova is a dead man. Talk, you piece of shit, because these are the last words l will hear from you. Sasha! Which Sasha? Sasha, the fat one... - Do you know him? - l have no fucking idea who he is. The address? - In the lofts by the market... - Number? On the second floor, opposite the restaurant. It's definitely not me... For fuck's sake! - Have you got a belly? - Seems like l've got one. - Who is this Tom Waits? - l don't know. Why the fuck did you buy it if you don't know who he is? l didn't buy it, it was given to me. So, is it your birthday today? A woman gave it to me for some reason. - Did you finally find a girl? - l didn't say that. Well, there's nothing wrong with chatting someone up. l didn't chat anyone up. l got acquainted with a woman, we had a coffee, she presented me a CD. That's how you should have started the stoy. Anmay, nobody gives gifts by accident. There's nothing between us. l've only seen her once. So, what, haven't you screwed her yet? - Max, she is a married woman. - So what? What does ''so what'' mean?! Would you like it if l was banging your wife without you knowing it? Don't fucking exaggerate. We are partners, Sylvester! Of course, l wouldn't like it. But l'm talking in general. lf someone, who l don't know, was banging my wife and l didn't find out, l wouldn't give fuck about it, cause l wouldn't know about it. lf l didn't know it, it wouldn't bother me. There's more to it, Max, it's a matter of principle. You want to say that you wouldn't bang a married woman even if she wanted it? Because of some shitty principle? This principle is far from shitty. l divorced with my wife, because someone was banging her for half a year. When l found out, l didn't feel so great. lt's a shitty business. Shitty! l don'twant to be a shithead, that is what this principle is about! But you fancied her, Sylvester? l did, so what? - But if you didn't have long to live? - So, what? Well, if you knew that you were going to die, your principles wouldn't change? lf, if, if... l bet a thousand euros that a man's principles would change in that situation. l don't think so. - A thousand euros! - OK. A thousand euros?! Ask Vova if he has a jack? - Vova, haveyou got a jack? - No. Cut that shit out, bitch. Where are the keys? ln the car, in the car, fuck... Wow, wow, wow, so fucking far, so fucking good. - Sylvester, our Vova knows more. - What's that? lt's better to see it rather than tell. Yeah, haven't seen something like this for a while. Guys, you know, l swear, you know, it's not me. l don't care who it is anymore. Get inside. - But, guys, listen... - Lie down, for fuck's sake. - Would you screw a married woman? - What? ln the arse, for fuck's sake. l'm asking if you were ever screwing somebody's woman? - What? -Am l not making myself clear? l don't understand the question. Are you fucking deaf? l'm asking you if you ever fucked a married woman. Guys, you know, l wasn't screwing around. You've definitely got something mixed up, l don't know anything. What the fuck does ''l don't know'' mean? - Is the question too dificult? - No. So, answer me then! There's a thousand euros at stake. - Guys, get me, l... -Answer the question! Guys, l don't know, you know, probably no, l wouldn't. l don't know. No, guys, no, no... l don't know. No, guys, no, no... For fuck's sake, a thousand euros... PART 2 THE DEATH OF THE SILVERCRANE THREE HOURS EARLIER Here... Three... Fucking 3? l said 20! l can't find anymore, there's nothing at home. So, search somewhere else, you faggot! Give me the cards. l've cleaned eveything out, there is nothing left. You better fucking search faster, 'cause if l don't get the cash by this evening, l'll turn you into the cops. lf l turn you in, then all you fuckers will go to jail for a longtime! You get me? So do you love me? What are you saying? l love you! l'm happy! Naughty boy, how could you, l'm still your wife! Cut! Here's that brandy you asked for. l don't need brandy, l need a doctor. Look at my leg! - Does it hurt a lot? - No, shit... it feels great. Kiesha, what the fuck are you talking about? lt was always OK, but now l'm not suitable? l don't get it. There's nothing to get here. Television needs tits, you don't have them. lf you want the lead role, you get tits. How will l get them? Simple, like eveyone else, go to a fucking surgeon. You fucking nuts? l can't even imagine how my husband will react to that. Monika, l don't give a fuck about your husband's reaction. l've got plenty of my own problems, and you are bothering me with yours. Television need tits. lf you want the lead role,you get tits, and if you don't want any problems, you take the roles that l offer you. That's it. Say what we wrote, otherwise l won't be able to edit it. Wow, buongiorno! Wait, wait... What are you staring at? Why didn't you lock the door? Me? You came here first, you could've locked it. - What happened to her? - Fuck...Let's go to her place. l can't really, l have to finish the casting. What do you mean you fucking can't, l will shove your casting up your arse! Go, hold her! He's thinking about casting... Vita, Vita, stop, wait! What? An entire human hand, covered in blood, caught on the front wheel! Oh, wow, how the fuck did it get there? C'mon, sort it out, l have to go. Kiesha, l won't sort it out. Are you stupid? l have to go to Vita's. l can't, l will be sick. Zenka, if l don't catch Vita, we will go to jail for a very long time. Andwhen we get tothejail you can vomit. Sojust sort eveything out and give me your car. Waiting forAdolfas.... What is this? l need a bag, something to keep this in. - l'm asking you what is here! - Better don't look! Zenka, are you mad? Where did you get this hand from? Just don't ask, it was under the car. Under which car? Under which? Under which? Under that car! Zenka, l can definitely tell you now, that we are going to jail. Why the fuck did you bring this hand here? - Where was l supposed to put it? -Where? Where? Throw it away! Where to throw it away? In the street? l dunno, in a forest, in a river, anywhere. Normally l wouldn't ask you, but l badly need some advance payment. After all l've seen? Vita, Vita, Vita... We had an agreement. The agreement is cancelled! All the actors are approved, l agreed eveything with TV station, the only thing missing is your sponsorship. Are you a fucking idiot or are you deaf? l just said that l won't participate any longer! For fuck's sake, Vita! Vita, what do l have to do to get at least part of that money? This mineral water has to be in the hands of every actor, and must be seen in every shot! Are we agreed on that? Yes, but l need money in advance... Here is what we agreed. l will walk... For fuck's sake... Get out, dickhead! And you too, bitch! - Who is this idiot? - Fuck, that's my husband. l'll fucking show you... Get out, dickhead! Fucking idiot! Get away from the car! Leave the car alone! Stop... You stupid fucking dickhead, you're fucked now... - Hello. - Where are you? Fucking where? l'm fucking catching hands in the river! Ok, l got the money, get yourself here. - No,you fucking come here. - l can't, your car's broken. How is it broken? lt's completely fucked up! Understand? Just come here. Fucking hell... PART 3 A 7500 LITAS SOAP OPERA Right... and what about me? Really, he said so? Listen, it wasn't like that, he was hitting on me. What? No... listen, l can't talk right now. Call me after about 20 minutes, 'cause l'm seeing him this evening. Ok, bye. - Hi! - Hi! - l ordered you a coffee. -Thanks. - So... - What? So, tell me, what's up? l need tits. At last, l've been telling you this the whole time. Tell me how. There's nothing to tell - you go to the surgeon, choose the size of the implant and that's it. And which size is yours? C. But you can choose any- D or F. The bigger the boobs the more obvious they're fake, though. Did it hurt? Thanks. And how much did it cost? Ten grand, including eveything, you know. - Ten thousand? - That's the price. You can look for something cheaper but then you'll risk the quality. Where will l get the money? From your husband. Ok,then you can do it my way. By taking a loan. Of course, it will take longer, all the paperwork, but it's better than nothing. So here's the clinic's card. Go there, they will give you a discount. l must go to work. - Bye. - l'm so glad you've made the decision. Right now we have reduced prices for breast aumentation. The operation will cost 8000, but with your discount it will be 7500. So what size are you interested in? Does it affect the price? No, all sizes costthe same. Please, take this. lt'll help you to understand the services that our company provides. l think it will make your choice easier. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Monica. What's the matter? Monica, give me the damn towel, l don't have anything to clean up with... Here you go. - Where were you? - At work, we were shooting. - And how was it? - Ok. - l think l'm gonna get one more role. - Cool. Are you going somewhere? Yeah, l have something to do, l'll be back in the evening. l need to talk to you. Ok, we can talk in the evening. lt's really really important for me. Get dressed, l'll wait. So? Max, l need some money. How much? What? l need it badly, l could pay you back little by little every month. Why the hell do you need so much? l don't want any arguments, l just want you to like me more. l like you the way you are. l don't feel good, l don't like the way l look so l've decided to get breast implants. Are you stupid? Don't... Why do you need a bigger fucking chest? Well, because l have a small chest. Your chest is fine. No, it isn't, Max, it isn't. And that's why l need money for the operation. Seriously? Over my dead body. My career and my whole life depends on it. l want to act, l want to get back on stage. So get the fuck back on the bloody stage. Why the fuck do you need big tits for that? You don't want me to look prettier? You look pretty to me, otherwise why the fuck would l have married you? l want to be happy. Yeah right, you'd be happy with some plastic instead of tits? lt's not plastic, it's silicon. lt makes no fucking difference! And you have to pay 7 and a half grand for that shit! That's fucking crazy! lf you don't give me the money l'll take a loan and pay for it myself. - Take what? - A loan. l'll take a loan from a bank. You take that loan, l'll stuff that loan up your arse and fuck you hard. OK, fuck me, but give me the money first. - Where's my lighter? - l don't know where your lighter is. -You could take out the trash. - Take out the trash yourself. The fucking bankis gonna buy her tits... damn. Monica, open the door, open the fucking door, l need to get changed. l won't open the door unless you promise to lend me the money. C'mon, open the fucking door and we'll have a talk. First you have to promise. l'll promise you fuck all. l'm standing in my dressing gown like some kind of queer, so open the fucking door. Max, l want the tits. l'll buy you those fucking tits, just open the goddamn door. Max, l want the tits and l want you to buy them for me. Monica, l paid for our wedding, for all of your fucking dresses, for the honeymoon, for all the goddamn trips and now you're talking to me like this. Max, you only see yourself. You only see yourself and when l need some help you don't help me. You will miss the money or what? Yes, l will miss those fucking 7500 which you will tuck in your breasts and wear for the rest of your life. Open the door you cunt, or l'll fucking kick it down. No, l won't open it, Max. l want those tits, l need those tits. Buy me the tits, l want those tits, l want those tits... You know, l need those tits, those damn tits, are you short on money? How much do they cost, you moron, can't you support me, huh? Should l borrow the money myself? You made me hysterical about the damn tits... ls somebody calling for me? l don't know, maybe...

This is totally out of order... Don't say a word, l'll kill the cunt myself... PART 4 JACKIE CHAN, RICE AND SILICON Ok, so the truck comes in the chink comes out, you take him and then l come by. Why the fuck do we need the chink? We're here for the stuff, not a fucking chink... Take it easy, no panic, understood? - Ok, staycool, man. - l'm cool. All right now... you're taking the stuff... Then you get into the carand leave. The stuff, the car, leave... And if the chink is a fucking karate man? Like fucking Jackie Chan? Who's fucking Jackie Chan? Don't you know Jackie Chan?

And bring him something to eat, 'cause l didn't give him anything. 'Cause l haven't eaten myself. Ok, ok, right. l'll bring the food and you are coming here, right? Ok. l'm cool... l write scripts. What scripts? You heard it, dumbass. Movie scripts. - What movies? - Movies for TV... l told some guy a couple of stories and he liked them. Then he asked if l could write some more. - What stories? - About life. Do l also appear in those stories? - More or less. - More or less? Are you fucking retarded? The names and surnames are changed. Only a part of the stoy is left. That's all. That's all? Have you ever asked me if l want you telling my story to some guy? Damn it, Lika! The stories are just soap opera and that's it. Millions of people all over the world watch those stories every day and nobody cares if they're fucking real or not. So why the fuck are you telling them if nobody fucking cares if they're real or not? l don't know. They seemed interesting for me. - You know what? - What? Fuck you! Damn it, Lika. l told you l hate it with eggs. Go fuck yourself if you don't like it. How many times have l told you that eggs are no good forme. Drink it yourself if you want it and make me one without any eggs. Can you make a drink without any fucking eggs for once? Give it to the chink. Well, Jackie Chan? Will you have a drink? Wanna eat? Lika, buy him some rice, l have no idea what else they eat there. You hear me? Buy it yourself, l have fuck all to do with it. Lika, you get dressed and get the fuck out of here to buy some fucking rice. Do you hear me? Fuck you and your rice! Watch your language, bitch, and remember who's wearing the trousers in this house. A trouser-wearing fucking poet, go and write some lines about the chink! l won't say this again - go get dressed and go buy the fucking rice. Fuck you! Fuck off. Are you sure it's here? l don't know. Vova told me that it's somewhere around the lofts. - Are you hungy? - Huh? - l'm asking, are you hungy? - Nope. Mate, could you buy me lunch? Remember, you owe me a thousand euros. Yeah, l know that, so what? lf l knew this was going to happen l would have brought my fucking wallet. Ok, l'll give you some cash, but l ain't going anywhere. You want me to go? Look at me, l'm not dressed properly. l can't go there. l'm vey interested, why? Think what you like, but l don't go to cafes or restaurants or bars. l don't get it. Do you have something against Asians? l like Asians. l just don't go to public eating houses on principle. You're fucking crazy, man. How many damn principles do you have? On principle... - Good afternoon. - Hi. Take a seat. l'd like to make an order to go. Chicken with mushrooms and sea cabbage. Ok, 18.50. Keep the change. Thanks. Take a seat, it'll take a while. - Thanks, but l'll stand. - OK. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. l'd like rice for two to go. - Just rice? - Just rice. 6.2O - Take a seat, it'll take a while. - l'll wait. What the fuck... Something's wrong? No, everything's fine. lt's just that l've never seen a gay guy in a Chinese restaurant wearing a robe. Let's eat. Lika, what is this? lt's what you asked for. But it's just rice. Where's the meat and vegetables and stuff? You didn't ask for that. Lika, can you do anything right just once in your life? ls it so hard to understand what l mean? l asked you to bring food, and you don't understand that rice won't be enough? You should ask the chink, he understands you very well. l don't know if you're married but l guess it's a woman... eat! l guess you have a woman and if you do you understand me completely. l know that you see and understand everything. You're a fucking whacko. Sasha, he doesn't understand a word you're tellin' him. Well, maybe he doesn't understand my words, but he understands my feelings perfectly- it's universal. Ooh, fucking poety. Listen to us, we're getting smarter every fucking hour. You'll never understand this. Open the door. Do it yourself. It's for you anyways. Can't you see that l'm feeding the chink? l don't give a fuck, that ain't my problem. Lika, you're asking for it. Oh, fuck! Why did you shoot you that bitch? l made it even between us. Shut the fuck up! You wanna go too, like your lady just did? Motherfucker... Wow, did you get your bitch those plastic tits? What? l asked, did you get your bitch those silicone tits? Yeah. Well, how much? l dunno. Don't gimme that shit. You got your bitch a pair of silicone tits and you don't know how much they cost? She said she got them for ten grand. Get outta here. Ten grand for a pair of fucking silicone tits. You heard that, Sylvester? l don't know much about tit prices. There's nothing to know. My bitch is asking for them too. Seven and a halfgrand. This dickhead here paid ten. You're fucking nuts? You don't like big breasts? l like tits. l really do, l simply don't like silicone ones. What's the difference? It's inside, you can't see a thing. Of course you can't see them, but you can feel them. There is a difference, a rather significant difference. You don't see it, but you know that there's some shit inside your bitch's tits. Some fucking plastic. You touch them, you stroke them and you fucking keep thinking that there's some fucking silicone inside. Would you fucking pretend there's nothing inside? l don't know, l've never thought about it. Sylvester, have you ever seen silicone? What do you mean? Have you ever seen silicone in its purest form? l have not. lt would be a sin to miss an opportunity to see the silicone for ten grand, wouldn't it? You're sick, you're fucking sick, you know that? l've never seen anyone cut into a girl's tits. Why in the world would you need that silicone anyway? l'll take it back to my bitch, so she can fucking see it with her own eyes. You're sick, Max! You're sick! l'm sick? Well is it not a sick thing to pay ten grand for this shit? That is vanity, Max, and the bigger it is the more expensive it gets. But what you just did here is sick, sick! l don't give a fuck. You tell your bitch about your vanity. l bet you'd spend a week on the street after that. ls this fucker OK? You put that shit inside your wife for ten grand. Was it worth it? Was it fucking worth it? She wasn't my wife. - What's that supposed to mean? - The fucking obvious. She's wearing a ring. She was married. You telling me that your bitch was somebody's wife? Yes. You're fucking nuts? Do you know where you're going? Where did you fuckin come from? Hey! You're OK? l'm not totally OK... l can see that, sicko. Motherfucker, you're lucky we didn't kill you. - Sasha, stop! - Get in the car. Good morning, arseboy. - You're fucked up. - l'm fucked up? - Yeah, you're fucked up! - We'll see who's fucked up. You'll be buying your bitch a dildo. She won't have anything to fuck soon. - You just try that motherfucker. - Try? Try l will... l'll tear you apart motherfucker. l'll kill you motherfucker. PART 5 SYLVESTERS GUN, PRINCIPLES AND 1000 EUROS They're for your wife? Come again? The flowers. Oh, no, they're for my colleague. He just got married. Would you like some? No, l'm on duty. That gun, must be your duty? l'm an omcer, but l don't carry it all the time. Perhaps when you're alone, naked and in bed. l have another gun when l'm naked. What caliber? lf this one is 9, the other is around 18. You're a married woman. You didn't ask if l'm a happily married woman. That's not my business. Don't hide it, Sylvester, l attract you sexually. We've just got acquainted. We didn't even have a coffee yet and you're already telling me that l like you. Do you often pay women's gas bills? l paid for your bill because l don't usually meet women whose credit cards get blocked. You're one of those men who show that they like women. l'll take that. When was the last time you danced, Sylvester? Excuse me? l'd like to dance with you. - Where? - Here. We're in a gas station. So what. l've never danced in a gas station. l don't dance. Listen, l've already told you- you're a married woman. l don't want any trouble. Sylvester, l'm not asking you to sleep with me in a gas station, l just want to thank you. lt was so close. He nearly cut my balls off! You're a lucky man. ls that a joke? He's real crazy. l told you. - Get out. - What's up with you, Sylvester. What's wrong, Sylvester. What are you looking for, man? My police gun, l put it under the papers. It's not here. Look under the seat, maybe it's... l've looked under the goddamn seat, it's not there. Get out, get out, sit down. lt's her, it's her. Sylvester, l wasn't expecting to see you. Where's my gun? Let me go, you're hurting me! l'll hurt you even more. C'mon, show me. - Where? - There on the table. Three bullets are missing. Could you move out of the way, l can't get through. l can't. l said l can't get through, could you move the car aside? Don't you understand asshole? l can't. Faggot in a gay robe. - Who is he? - My husband. For fuck's sake, Caroline, you fucked up your man with my police gun. l wanted to scare him. With three bullets? What did he do to you? Why did you do it? What did he do to me? Look what he did to me. l got money, here, Sylvester, please, help me, l don't have anything else... What are you doing, Sylvester? Sit down. Max, what are you doing there? - Who is he? - How should l know? - Where's your bathroom? - There. Who is he? Fuck. Tell me what's going on. lsn't it obvious? This stupid bitch fucked up her man with my service gun. Where are his things? - Which things? - All the things. He went away on a holiday, a very long holiday. Where did he go? What's the fucking difference? l'll have to say something, l'm still his wife. To Rhodes. Where is Rhodes? ln Greece. He wasn't fond of Greece. For fuck's sake, Caroline, l don't care about his likes and dislikes, you tell me where he went. Listen, Sylvester, it seems rather weird that a man went on holiday to a place which he hates. l don't give a shit who he was. That's your problem and your responsibility. Max don't just stand there, give me a hand. Hang on. l don't get it. How did she get your gun? lt's a fucking long stoy, l don't have time for that. Give me a hand. Wait a second. Here lies the body of some dumbfuck, who was shot with your gun. Right next to him sits this dumbfuck's bitch, who somehow stole your gun. l don't understand a fucking thing. Alright, Max, we'll deal with this. We? l'm not involved in this and l don't want to get involved. We're colleagues. We're colleagues at work, but this is your personal life. When you cut that slut's tits l fucking didn't do a thing. That slut's tits weren't your fucking business. l saved your fucking balls. Without me you'd be carying your balls in you hand. Alright. But first, l have to win my thousand euros back. - From who? - From her. What if you lose? l'll owe you fucking two thousand euros. Would you fuck a married man? - Sylvester, what's going on? - Answer the question. lt's not a fucking swinger party. l won't ask you three times, bitch, answer- would you fuck a married man? l don't give a shit if a man is married or not. Zero zero. We're even, Sylvester. Where's the case? lt's alright. See for yourself. Who's he? He's handcuffed to the case. l don't need an Asian. Listen, we had a deal for a case only. lf you don't get along with him, you can set him free. Cash, cash! Here's part of it. What part? We had a deal that you pay all of it. The deal went wrong. What do you mean? l mean that l didn't ask for a fucking chink. Get it? Damn it, Caroline, what the fuck? Where's my money? Where's my money? Listen, l'll take him now and bring you the money tomorrow. You're fucking crazy, the bitch is taking him. You'll take him when l receive all of my cash. Get it, bitch? - Alright. - What's alright? l'll bring you the money tomorrow. You fucking hurry, l ain't waiting for you any longer. Max, is that your wedding suit? Congratulations! Give my best wishes to your wife. l will. Sylvester, long time no see... ls eveything alright or did l miss something? Eveything's fine. You're too fucking nice today. Where's that guy? ln the trunk. - Oh, that's Sasha. - You know him? Do l know him? This fucker was screwing with my wife. With who? With my wife, Lika. You're telling me his bitch was your wife? What do you mean "was"? She's still my wife, we just don't live together, but we're not divorced. l got that bitch a pair of tits for ten grand. You seen her? No, we haven't. - Hi, honey. - Hi. What are you doing here? l'm making you a milkshake. l'm wondering whether l should put an egg in it or not. Don't. That's what l thought... Especially when you hear that l'm pregnant. What? Yes and the child is yours. Promise me that you'll never leave me. What you're talking about? l love you. l'm happy. Bastard, how could you. l'm still your wife. What are you doing, Leokadia? l'll shoot both of you! No... No, no, Leokadia! Don't say anything! l'll kill that bitch myself.
