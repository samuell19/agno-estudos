This film is a work of fiction based on historical facts, all characters and groups are fictitious. Spring 1945, Karafuto Prefecture, Esotoru subprefecture (South Sakhalin) Welcome! Thank you for taking the time. Thank you. Please come in. Tadaima. (greeting) Tadaima. Okaeri. (greeting) Okaeri. The sakura are blooming. It's so beautiful! The sakura are blooming. It's a miracle in this northern land. Are these cherry blossoms? Yes. You succeeded. You took good care of this cherry tree. Of course, it's my offspring. Thanks to you who brought the seeds from the mainland, I was able to plant the tree. Seeds? This came from a seed sowed when you were born. The flowers are such a sight. This shows that nothing is impossible for us here. Even seeing cherry blossoms at Karafuto. I thought I would never see it again. I really missed it. Saa. Everyone gather together. Let's take a commemorative photo. Come and take a souvenir photo. A little more to the center. (Sakhalin Island Timber Institute) Ready! Tetsu Tokujiro Flower buds inherit the tenderness of spring about there Stand up in the branches Blooming in all colors Proud fragrance When the flowers bloom No matter who is looking at you Here we go We are for you Sing a song of praise For some forestry work I will go to the northern woodes to investigate. Itterashai. (greeting) Itterashai. Itterashai. On Sakhalin Island unlike Hiroshima or Nagasaki life continued almost normally in spite of the war. However, the Soviet Union broke the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact, signed in 1941, and declared war on Japan. The Soviet Army attacked on 9th August. Sakhalin Island suffered a devastating air raid. Any news about my husband? There is no news, it is very worrying. (Ezure family, Shujiro, Seitaro) (Tetsu, Tokujiro) Otosan? (Dad) Hej, you! Are you all safe? Wonderful! This road leads to the train station, 76 km away. It will take at least three or four days. Take as little baggage as possible. Tetsu, what about food? I think it should last for four or five days. After arriving on Hokkaido Island go to Abashiri. Abashiri. Please wait for me at this address. Yes. And this plaque, please keep it for us. Seitaro, you are the eldest son, Mother and Shujiro will rely on you. Yes. I will protect them both. Otosan, why do we have to go back to Hokkaido? I will join you soon, please wait for me. It can't be helped! Let's make a promise! On the day of the full moon our family of four will reunite in Hokkaido and enjoy the beautiful cherry blossoms together. Sakura all bloom at full moon. I absolutely want to see them. We will see it, right? You should get going. Otosan! Since you don't go I will go first. Otosan! My dear, don't die. Enemy airplanes! Run! This way! Run! Otosan! No way out! There are Soviet soldiers ahead. We are finished. We have no way of escape! We can't give up! Even if you think you can't, keep going. Find another way. There must be another way! To protect you from destruction, to return without incident, this is my mission. However, now that ... Head nurse, we stay together. Yes Yes Stop, don't do that kind of stupid thing. Don't give up! Of the 23 people who attempted suicide together, including the head nurse, a total of six died. Seitaro? I want to go back. I want to fight with my father! Wait, Seitaro! What did father tell you? Mother and Shujiro rely on me. Otosan? Otosan? Otosan? What happened? - Otosan! What happened? He is dead! Seitaro! Okasan! (Mother) I'm very hungry, I'm starving. Eat this, take. Tonight is almost new moon. It's still a long time until the full moon. That's Cygnus. That's Aquila. Brother really likes the night sky. I want to be an astronomer when I grow up. Shujiro, how about you? Me? I used to be the tail of a crane at school. So stupid. Totally useless. What could I ever become? You are not stupid. You're better than me. Just a little. A little? So I could become someone. Look, there are meteors. Okasan, a shooting star! I hope we will see the sakura in bloom. What can I hope for? I hope to meet Otosan again. (20 August 1945, Sakhalin Island Port) On 20 August, the submarine cable laying ship "Ogaswara Maru" docked at Sakhalin Island Port. Refugees scrambled to get on board in a disorderly way. Seitaro! Seitaro! Seitaro! Seitaro! Brother! Seitaro! The Soviet Army has landed in Manaoka. They will soon be here. Hurry up, get on board! No more! The boat is full! Let me go! Brother! Seitaro! Hey, don't block the road! Go away! Go! Okasan! Okasan! Seitaro! I got the boat ticket. We can take a boat. I thought we had lost you. Stop crying, fool. We will always be together. Unexpectedly, a terrible thing happened: The ship Ogasawara Maru ... (Spring, 1971, Sapporo) Tanukikoji Shopping Street Broadcast Come on 3 February next year to the first sale at the opening of the Sapporo Olympics. It will open on Friday, 16 April. This hot dog doesn't look tasty. What should I do? Shujiro, this pink feels wrong. In Los Angeles the colors are more vivid. Our food may be different in Abashiri, but the design must be the same as abroad. You're right. I ask the president to say something to us. The era of large department stores is over. Take the United States as an example. The time of small shops is about to start. Tell me about your work rules. Yes! Put guests first. Raise your head and respect your guests. The uniform should be changed every two days. Before work every day, you have to bow to the photos of the Los Angeles head office. Keep a 24-hour business attitude. Work more than others. Yes. Everybody must be loud. Shout these codes. Yes! President, if I may. If you push your employees to do this, the Labor Bureau might start to object. What are you saying? Don't you understand the situation? This is the first branch in Japan! Who can only play tricks, will not last long! Yes! Give me relentless work. We have nothing to spare. Hello. It's me. Ah, Shujiro-san. There are already long queues before opening the store! Please come, too. Yes! Thank you. It's unprecedented! It's really amazing! Irrashaimase! (Greeting) Irrashaimase! Amazing! Awesome! The situation is very good! Please go to the office. And report to your father in Los Angeles. Yes. Good Morning! Gokuro sama desu! (Greeting) Hello, thank you for calling. This is the Minnesota 24 store. President! There is someone from Abashiri City Government who wants to tell you something. Yes, it's me, Ezure. I understand. What did they say? It concerns my mother. What? I must go. (Abashiri) Shujiro, leave this frozen snow country! Don't worry about me. Work hard and take care of yourself. Work harder than the others. Build your own life. Live freely. Everything about me, forget it all from now on! Everything about me, forget it all from now on! (Ezure Onigiri Restaurant) Douzo. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Please. Yoshi! Have a drink, too. I can't drink. This way. Douzo! Sumimasen. (Excuse me) Sumimasen. Irrashaimase. Shujiro? Should I say "tadaima" (I'm back)? Don't scare me. Isn't this a dream? You have changed a lot. I hardly recognized you. Okasan, too, is a little older. Isn't it? After all, 15 years have passed. Sit down, sit down. The rice balls (onigiri) are ready. They are still hot. You used to be so hungry, shouting "I'm starving". Are you still cooking in the kettle? It tastes better that way. Come, eat. Quickly! Tasty. Very tasty. Good. Okaeri. (Welcome back) Are you happy to see me? What nonsense? Isn't this natural? You didn't even write a letter to me. Haven't I sent one? I didn't want you to worry about me. There is still nothing here. Very simple. But haven't I always sent you money? That's the money saved by your hard work. I am reluctant to spend it. I saved it. It's for you, mother, the money I sent. At least repair the entrance sliding door. This is enough. Repairs are not necessary. Did you come because you worried? If so, don't worry, I am in good health. Are the rice balls ready? I am sorry. Not ready yet. No problem, give me as much as you can. Sumimasen. My brother on the fish market said this was left over. He gave me some fish. Let's take half of it. Today we are lucky, we have halibut. Are you a police officer? That was a long time ago. Hey! Aren't you Shujiro? That's right, Shujiro. He finally came back. You have become such a successful person. I read it in the newspaper. What is the company called? I'm the president of Minnesota 24 in Japan. President? That's really amazing. So good, so good. Tetsu-chan will no longer be lonely. After all, since the neighbours moved, she has been living alone. I don't feel lonely at all. When I need anything, someone will help. Whenever, I smile, others will smile back to me. It's almost time to go. Hora! (look) Thank you for caring. How are you doing? Yes. Today is an important big day. Yamaoka-san, come with me, too. I'll buy beer and come back. I will buy it. I can get it on credit, no problem. Well. I still wonder what to do. Did the city authorities contact you? This combined house and shop will be removed soon. For too long there has been no business registration in this shop. There will be problems. But it will be fine, if you are willing to come back. When did she become like this? Already for two or three years. But only occasionally. Normally she is as before, nothing has changed. What is this? This is an abacus. Ab abacus? Something like a computer. Otsukaresama. (Greeting) Otsukaresama. You are still here? You are late. What about turnover? The customers queued until noon. But it stopped after that. Only about 60% of the target. Japanese! They won't eat hot dogs at night. Americans neither. For night-time visitors buy as many products as possible. Put discounts on some items should be more than 50%. Start tomorrow. But, President. the store only opened today. Shouldn't we first see the customers' reaction? The sooner you make a decision, the better. It's not good enough to be like the Los Angeles head office. Irrashaimase. Irrashaimase. Irrashaimase. I brought her here. Thank you for your help. Everything is like in the past. Mari-san, this is my mother. Eh? Hajimemashite! (Greeting) I am Mari. I am Ezure Tetsu. Yoroshiku onegai shimasu. (Greeting) What a beauty! Not at all. What does it mean to "stay temporarily"? My mother is also very polite. I know. I didn't plan to do this. But I was shocked after I went there. My mother said not to worry. But it became difficult to continue in Abashiri. You don't need to bring her here. Your mother is not busy running a Japanese restaurant. She didn't even attend the wedding. What did I say after coming to Japan? Did I not ask to see her right away? What did you answer at the time? You said your relationship is already very weak. You didn't want to go and meet her. And now ... Please, I have only you. I was fooled like this before. Really, I have only you. You are selfish. The color is beautiful and the size is just right. Look, Okasan, it's very beautiful! Perfect for you! Okasan! This one is more suitable for you. Choose this one. I'm not used to this. It's too expensive, it's wasted on me. Don't wear any old, patched clothes. I will help you buy some new clothes. Casual clothes, too. Later, you will be able to buy such clothes cheaply in my shop. Help her find two or three sets. I'm already going back to our store. Good. Okasan, let's try some more dresses. I have never bought so many clothes before. No need to be so polite. Next time we buy some shirts. It feels like being in heaven. Your husband died in Siberia? I'am very sorry! It's okay, it's still alive. Mari-san, please help me. What is it? Do you have some ink or paste? What should I do with those? I want to protect the sakura, and prevent the water from entering. Really? We can't do that without preparation. Oh! Okasan! Your shoes. Didn't you wear black, low heeled shoes? Is something wrong? Very wrong! You must have left them in the shop. Let's go back to the department store. Quickly. They might have removed the shoes already. When we returned to the department store, they thought we had stolen the shoes. I had to make a big show: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I can't understand it. We all make mistakes. But the color is not the same. How is it possible to take the wrong shoes? I'm sorry for the trouble you had. Isn't something wrong with your mother? She talks to sakura trees. You should take her to the hospital. Don't say that. She is not normal. Anything about your mother is fine in your opinion. Keep taking her side. Otsukaresama. President, a Mr. Sugimoto Hisashi came to see you. Sugimoto Hisashi? He said that he is the son of a doctor, and you were classmates in elementary school. I don't know him, but I will meet him. Ezure! Long time no see, Ezure-Beat-it. Look what a fine guy you have become. I am sorry. Who are you? I have no recollection of you. You don't remember this face? We used to play together, when I was in Abashiri. I recently moved to Sapporo, because my dad wants to open a clinic here. Abashiri? What are you talking about? I am Sugimoto. Higashi. (Sugimoto Hospital) Ow, that hurt. Don't touch my newspaper with those dirty hands. You shit. Give me another one. Quickly! Black guy, black guy! Black guy! Black guy! Ezure! Beat it! Fuck off! Beat it! Beat it! Beat it! Ow! The rice in the black market is really black. Take a look at this. It's so dirty! Get lost! Ezure! Beat it! Fuck off! Ezure! Beat it! Fuck off! So, what can I do for you? Hi! How are you doing? What can I do for you? What ...? He is asking what you want? Ah! I want to open a cafe. A hipster cafe. Can you please lend me some money? How much? Two million. (20,000 $) Any guarantee? No. Banks won't give you any credit. Trust me. Give me a year and I will pay you back. Are we not friends? I just remembered something. What did you call me before? What? Ezure what? Ezure! Beat it! Fuck off! Louder! Ezure! Beat it! Fuck off! Ezure! Beat it! Fuck off! I remember more and more clearly! Ezure! Beat it! Fuck off! Remember these words. (200 $) This money is enough for you. You are not worth more. Pick it up! Don't want any money? Pick it up for me! Shujiro-san! Irrashaimase! Irrashaimase! Would you like a hot dog? Have a hot dog while it's hot. Irrashaimase! Irrashaimase! Manager, good bye. Otsukaresama. Otsukaresama. Otsukaresama. Mari-san, you can never understand the relationship between a mother and a son. No matter how hard it is ... No, worse than that. No matter how hungry. In the icy snow, no food, not even warm clothes. There was no way to keep warm, but she was there! Even in that situation wholeheartedly protecting me. Come in! May I disturb you? Can we talk about it later? It's urgent, there is a lady who looks like your mother. She bought two cans of paste. She is in this heavy snow without a coat. So I am a bit worried. Mari-san, Mari, I'm going to look for my mother. Please bring her home. I'll go home and wait there. She went west. Okasan? So that's where she went. It's okay, it's okay. Although it's very cold. It's getting warmer, right? It's alright. Okasan! Okasan! The brain activity has slowed down, but that's normal in elderly people. Don't worry too much. It's not Alzheimer's. Fortunately it's nothing worse. In earlier times have there been incidents that hit her hard, something she strongly wants to forget? The doctor said there is no abnormality in the brain. Probably it's due to a change of environment that makes you suddenly tired. No. It's my fault. I'm becoming more and more abnormal. The doctor said, there was no problem. Don't tell Mari-san about the health check today. This is a film. Do you remember? You can still do it. Incredible, isn't it. As expected by the president the sales of hot dogs are slow. The taste is not different from the place of origin. We must find special measures for Japan. Any ideas? Would you like to try a Hot Dog Promotion Week? With discounts, so that all goods will become cheaper. Yes! Instead of such short-term promotions are there any longer-term ideas? If we don't find any strong idea, everything will collapse. What are you doing? What happened? This might start a fire. Hurry up! Really disturbing neighbours! Sorry, sorry. I will put out the fire now. It's very hot. Everyone, I apologize for the disturbance. How dare you! Really, Okasan, what's wrong with you? Sorry. Sorry. Ah, hot! Are you okay? I'm okay. I hope that sometime you can also eat the delicious rice balls. No-one has ever complained about cooking in a stove before, so I didn't realize. What if there is a fire? Don't say anything. I check. Almost ready. The rice core has not been cooked yet. It's fine. Try to make rice balls. Indeed, a little bit hard. But delicious. Mari-san! That's it! Everybody try it! Itadakimasu. Really tasty. Can you do it? It tastes different. The tongue also needs training. You are still far away. Okasan, is there anything else you need to pay attention to? Add a bit of mirin to the cooking water. It adds sweetness and makes it tastier. We will offer this from tomorrow. Starting tomorrow, I will have a tasting every day. This is my first time, and it turned out so well. After ten days, we will start promoting. Please order an advertising stand now. Yes. Here we sell rice balls! Would you like one? Irrashaimase! We sell rice balls! It's delicious! Would you like one? Irrashaimase! Otsukaresama! How much did we sell? Only two. One plum flavor, one salt flavor. What a shame, only two people bought it. No, one customer bought two. It is difficult to change the crowd. Without perseverance nothing is possible. Yes! I also buy a salted rice ball. Tasty! It's fine. It's past eight. This is the last one. Throw the remaining away. Too much waste. Think about another way. No, we cannot damage our own standards. No need to talk about selling cheaply. You can't eat it either. All right, dispose of it. Throw it away. Do you want to reduce the quantity tomorrow? Stick to the plan, 30 again. Yes! A moment, please! President, phone call. 40 Yen for you, thank you for your patronage. Okasan! What did you do? She wanted to leave with my onions. I told you I was taking it on credit. Who is the credit accounted for? Please take care of my mother from today. What are you doing? I'm really sorry. Things happened in an instant. I was also shocked. Okasan, this is the behaviour of thief. A thief? I just didn't bring my wallet with me. Forgive me. It's just green onions. I want to add green onions to the rice balls. Didn't I do it often before? Soak this in soy sauce. Add some sesame oil. Please! How much trouble do you have to give me? I want to know nothing. Okasan! I managed to go to Los Angeles, where everybody ignored me. Nobody even looked at me. Under these circumstances I still hoped to achieve something. Trying as hard as I could. It was difficult to climb to this position! I had to seize my chance. I can't let it slip away! Just for this stupid thing! Sorry! Anyway, a bunch of green onions is not more than 20 yen. I don't think I need to call the police. I'm really sorry. And for your phone expense. Please calm down. That's a lot. She is a bit demented. I'm very sorry. Demented? And besides that, you'd better stop selling vegetables in your shop. That will cause problems in your shop. That's a completely different matter. Take her home, please. I still have to work to do. Yes. Let's go. Fortunately, I was not present. What a loss of face, otherwise. Darling, what do you think of me? Why? My sister often said: "He just wants to succeed in Abashiri." "Don't trust him." Maybe she was right. If you want to think that, there's nothing I can do about it. My dad will ask some questions about you, too. Because you went against the head office. You'll have to admit your mistakes. He will interrogate you the day after tomorrow. What? Please come to Sapporo Airport with me to pick him up. I can't make excuses for you. It's a matter of course to do what the shareholders want. Today I sleep here. I'll get a blanket. Oh no! Excuse me, is this the train to Abashiri? Take this train and change in Asahikawa. Thank you. Attention, please. Regular train to Asahikawa. Departing soon. Passengers who want to board, please get on as soon as possible. Regular train to Asahikawa. Departing soon. Doors closing, please be careful. Okasan! What...? Where are you going? I was wrong. Yesterday, I had to say that. Okasan, you are certainly not demented. Thank you. It doesn't matter. Sorry! Let's go home. I don't want to always trouble people. Neither you, nor Mari-san. What are you saying? I will always, always be with you. I want you to live in a big house, to eat well and wear good clothes. You have done enough this month. But we are people from different worlds. Live a good life together with Mari-san. What will you do, Okasan? I don't know. First I will go to pray at the shrine. What? What happened? It's hard, but it works. Until five years ago, I used to come here every year. But nowadays I can't do it anymore. However, with you it's different. With you I can climb up again. Okami-sama, (spirit, god) thank you very much. This is much more than what I prayed for. Ezure Shujiro has returned to me. I can only offer you my prayers and my gratitude. I had lost my trust in you. I thought that you had changed, that you had gone. How stupid. How could this happen? You are the same as in the old days. Isn't this just normal? You don't have a baseball glove? Lift your ass! The strike zone is here! Strike! Ow! Good shot! My butt hurts. This guy is crying! Shujiro! It's not time to cry! Fight back! Stop! Run, run! Okasan! I was beaten today, but I also kicked them. I know, I know. Look. How's that? Great! This is your baseball glove. Thank you! I don't remember this at all. So you don't remember that baseball glove and what happened to it? As soon as I used it all the seams came apart. But I couldn't tell you. For 15 years I saw you working hard, working hard every day. But the most important, okasan, was how you took care of us. Without a husband, it was not easy. But I still had a good time with Shinji-san, Mitsue-san, and the Akiyama family next door. By and by everybody left. So lately I became lonely. I only remember Shinji-san. He seems to run a big company in Asahikawa now. Apparently, he is very successful. If only you would marry him, that's what I always thought. Let's take some pictures before we forget. Okasan. Let's go and see Shinji-san. Eh? What do you mean, you're not coming home tonight? My father is arriving tomorrow. Do you realize the situation? Please tell your father that I'm really sorry. Something important has happened, and I can't meet him in Sapporo. What is so important? I need to be with my mother now. You can't be serious. Papa said "no". You might be fired as president. I'm aware of that. Anyway, I can't leave my mother alone. Ja! (so long) The company said, no problem. Next stop, Asahikawa! The next stop will be at Asahikawa Station. Shinji-san, I'm looking forward to seeing him again. What' up, kid? What are you doing here? I am looking for food. I'm so hungry, I'm so hungry. This kid is so miserable. I see, you were drawn by this rice ball? You are a wild dog. Okay, I get it. This rice ball, just for you. Don't do such a shameful thing! Wait a moment! The little ghost is so hungry that he can't walk. What kind of world is it? You need a good meal to be strong. Women are willing to offer their chastity, aren't they? Brother, this is a great idea. The woman is pretty. Where are you going? Are you refugees? Only the two of you? Stop! That woman has really given up. Find a place now. What's your name? Ezure, Tetsu. That's right, Tetsu-san? Listen, Tetsu-san. Do you want to work for me? I do it for the benefit of others. But the government regards me as a bad guy. I am responsible for transporting white rice. Selling rice on the black market. (Hikari Shipping Co.) What a big company! Let's check it out! I haven't seen him for a long time. Shinji-san worked hard, too. Oh, look, that man! Isn't that Iwaki-san? He still looks very healthy. He had been shot with a pistol, right? Shujiro. I have seen the situation, it's enough for me. I want to leave. What happened? Shinji-san took care of me more than anyone. The money for our restaurant ... Actually, Mr. Shinji paid it. And I never paid him back. I am an old woman, and although I would like to see him, I don't feel like it. Ezure-kun didn't come to the airport. This guy really doesn't have any manners. I think he is getting more and more arrogant. Listen, papa. He really is too much! Like this business about his mother. They both lied to us. And the company lost money. He only bosses people around. Thank you for your patronage. Hand-made rice balls, delicious! Minnesota 24 special rice balls. Would you like one? Would you like a rice ball? Minnesota 24 special rice balls. Delicious food you can't eat at home! Hygienic rice balls Formed with sterile gloves! Would you like one? Chief Okabe is here. Irrashaimase! Irrashaimase! What do you think about the launch of the rice balls? Please tell me honestly. Because it's a plan of the president, we are willing to carry it out. In return for the president's kindness, we are willing to work hard. Besides that, we would like to adapt hot dogs to a Japanese style. We tried to add something that caters to Japanese tastes, with fresh vegetables inside. We don't think the American approach works here. Owner, please try it. Otsukaresama deshita! Otsukaresama deshita! Ja, yoroshiku! Please give me a rice ball. Thank you! - Thank you! A total of 115 yen. Here you go. It seems a little different from what you reported. He is always dressing people down. When he was working in Los Angeles, he seemed very smart. It seems that this is still the case. Even if your private life is not going well, I will still leave him in charge of the Japanese shop for now, and give him the responsibility. Someday, he will be somebody. Sweetheart, do you want to divorce him? It's nothing. He didn't steal from you. Dad, did I misunderstand anything? Your dad might also be demented, but he wants Mari to stay by his side. (Shirataki station) Do you remember this station? Yes, I remember it well. Service stop. Train arriving now. Shirataki Station, Shirataki Station. Let's go! Hey! What's going on? Throw everything away, and escape in different directions! Quick! Stop! Don't move! Quickly! Stop! Tetsu-san, hurry up! Hurry! Stop! Tetsu-san, that way! Stop! Stop or I will shoot! Don't move! Got you! Don't move! Yamaoka-san? It's you! You are Yamaoka-san! Madam? You are still alive! That's great! That's wonderful! Run now! Quickly! Run that way! Hurry up! Run! What a surprise! An amazing coincidence! He was so nice, helping us instead of shooting us. After that, he secretly let me get away three more times. Nobody was like him. Always treating people kindly. I am so thankful for that chance encounter. But Yamaoka-san, he betrayed everybody. He sold everybody out. That's what was said in our shop-house. You must have heard it, too. I don't know what really happened. But people tried anything to survive. How did we get away that time? Hard to say. At that time, we lost the rice. All of it was confiscated. Probably the rice got split between the policemen. Did Yamaoka-san also eat some of it? Next time I will ask him. Over there, we ran into the forest. Hiding, fleeing desperately. I don't know. But how much happier we are now. Do you remember this place? Such a beautiful place. I don't think I have been here before. Okasan, I can't move. I'm so hungry, so hungry. We are not stealing. We found this on the ground. Hey! What are you doing? Was that here? I never did something like that. Did you forget everything that puts you in a bad light? How convenient, isn't it? Let's go back. Not yet. Don't know where this road leads? Far away! Far away! Into the past. This pickled fish is delicious. It's perfect with potatoes. It's really delicious. Dozo. (Here you go.) Actually, you two are my first guests this month. The neighbours didn't come. And there is no one left here. So I don't have many opportunities to chat. It's nice that mother and son travel together. Have some more sake. Shujiro-san. Do you know Mitsue-san? Did you mention her last time? I don't know her. Was she the one who appeared after I left? She said her lover would be in jail for five years. So she wanted to wait nearby. After closing the shop, she would always come over, and we would toast every day. How is she now? I don't know. A few years ago, she suddenly stopped coming. I don't know what happened. We were friends. You must have been fooled by a tanuki (a raccoon in disguise). That's why she suddenly stopped coming. It's very strange. Try this bottle. You'll like it. Sumimasen. "Mitsue-san, you are lucky." "The person you are waiting for lives nearby." "I would also wait like this." Whenever I said this, Mitsue-san always replied: "What does it matter, you still have your son." I want to ask you for the first time. Do you remember Otosan? Of course, I do! I can't remember his face. Why didn't I take his picture with me? Okasan. The two of us having a drink together, isn't that amazing. Ezure Tokujiro-san, in February of Showa 22 (1947) passed away in Siberia. I am sorry for your loss. He regretted not to be able to see you. Instead, you receive this. It is a stone from Siberia. I want to ask you something. Did anybody confirm the death of my husband? We couldn't investigate it. We survivors experienced such a lot of hardship. How can you come here with this stone? Is this a lie you made up? Not at all. So who did? It's been a long time since we had white rice. Let's eat together with Otosan. Itadakimasu. Itadakimasu. How delicious! Yes, it's delicious. Let's take a deep breath and throw it as far as possible. Your dad must be alive. Shujiro, be strong. Didn't you say, you don't cry? He will certainly come back. For sure. Okasan, can I sleep next to you? Do you remember? I remember very clearly. Shu-chan! Get up! Give me a moment. Just a little moment. You can't sleep, you will die! It's so warm. I can't anymore. Otosan is calling me. No! Get up! Get up! Otosan! Shu-chan, get up! Get up! Shujiro! Get up! You mustn't fall asleep! No need to wait for the train. It's almost time to go back to Sapporo. No! I haven't told you yet, but your home in Abashiri has been demolished. You can't go back. I know. So, where are you going to live now? I will go back to Karafuto. What? I'm going to get your dad's photo. Photo? But it's impossible to go to Karafuto now. What are you going to do? To Karafuto? (Wakkanai Port) You want to go to Karafuto without preparation? Is there a system like visa on arrival? No. Okasan, you see? Seitaro? Seitaro? (In the early morning of August 22, 1945) Get up! There are torpedoes! It's a torpedo! Seitaro! Shujiro! Seitaro! Shujiro! Seitaro! Shujiro! Shujiro! Shujiro! It's okay, it's okay! Okasan! Shujiro! Shujiro, calm down! Don't let go! Seitaro, what are you doing? I will be fine. No, stay here with us. I can't! Stay with us! Seitaro! Okasan! Stop! Seitaro! Seitaro! Come back! Seitaro! Come back! Here! Over here! Seitaro! Over here! Here! Seitaro! Faster! Seitaro! Here! Here! Come back! Calm down! Don't think of the past! Forget what happened! I was responsible for Seitaro's death. No! My brother sacrificed himself to save us both. I wanted to sacrifice myself for him. Seitaro! Such a good brother! Seitaro! Quickly! Officers of the Central Health Authority are investigating. We consider this rice ball as raw food. This shop didn't apply for a permit to sell raw food. Every day after 8pm we dispose of all unsold goods. It's completely hygienic. Suspend the production for now. But this will cause us a serious loss of reputation! Director, what should we do? What shall we do? Shujiro-san. Sorry for keeping you waiting. Ezure-san fell asleep with a sedative. We will wait for the situation to stabilize. In two or three days she should be fine again. Good bye. She never told me about Seitaro. And I didn't take the initiative to ask her. She must have felt deeply guilty and oppressed by her feelings. I didn't know either. After you left, your mother kept repeating like a mantra: "I have no right to happiness." No TV, no refrigerator, no washing machine. And she worked so hard. As to myself, even if it takes me a lifetime ... Yamaoka-san! Thank you for coming all the way from Wakkanai. I have no one else to rely on. My mother has always been very grateful to you, Yamaoka-san. What is this place? Why am I here? Since last year, in my head I keep bumping into doors. In my head, there is the memory of a house with many different rooms. The doors of the rooms open and close. I don't know which door is the right one, and I feel anxiety. There is a room with a wonderful memory and I want to find it. But I can't tell which door is the right one. Where is the room belonging to Tokujiro? I don't even remember what his face looked like. Where is it? Where? I want to remember. Who is that? Who is there? Tetsu-san. Please look at this picture. It shows 15 people kept as prisoners in Siberia. This is you, right? That's him! That's him! Do you remember his face? I have sinned against you. Even in a whole lifetime, you cannot make up for it. The prison in Siberia was so cold. It was unbearable. I became a spy. I secretly informed them about Tokujiro-san. I told them many lies. Please stop talking! Of the 15 people sent to Siberia only I returned! What did I do? In the past 25 years, I have thought of it every day. What could I tell you? Look! In the photo he is smiling. If that's the case If that's the case maybe you don't have to worry any longer about what happened with Seitaro. Tadaima. Okaeri. I talked to the health inspectors. We will put the rice balls in the refrigerator, a very large refrigerator. Back on track. How is mother? She is still in Wakkanai. It's my fault. Shujiro, you didn't say anything, but I finally understand. This is certainly not something I can impose. Please come closer. Look at me. Do you ever think about my situation? I came here from Los Angeles, knowing nobody, feeling lonely. I didn't know what to do all day or night. I felt lonely. Shujiro Please look at me. Please! Look after me. I behaved badly, Mari! I also want to take good care of your mother. Ah, Shujiro-kun? Something bad happened. Tetsu-san was still here at breakfast, But now she has disappeared. You entrusted her to me, but this happened. Yamaoka-san, ohisashiburi! (Long time no see.) Ohisashiburi! Shujiro, you look very smart. I saw your name in the magazine. This is my wife. I am Mari. Did my mother come to see you? My mother said she still owed you money. Nonsense! She paid me back ten years ago. After that, she kept sending me money, although I had sent her a letter telling her the money had been paid off. And I couldn't reach her by phone. I always hoped you would marry my mother. So did I. Once the shipping company was on track, I made up my mind and wrote to propose to her. The day I went to hear her reply, she received me in a white mourning dress. White mourning dress? I means, she doesn't ever want to remarry. I understand, Tetsu-san. Please accept a small request, and let me remain here a moment. Let the woman wear a white mourning dress for Tokujiro-san. But I wanted to know what kind of person she was. In this moment, Tetsu-san was very beautiful. But after all, I was refused. Not at all. Mother always kept loving Shinji-san. Finally I found her. A prison parole officer told me to come here. We're almost there. Here. (Miss Kitami) Yes? Yamaoka-san. This is Mitsue-san. I am the son of Ezure Tetsu. My name is Shujiro. May I ask if my mother has been bothering you? How could she come here? I heard that you had a good relationship with her. If it's for money, I have nothing. Yamaoka-san. You should have noticed it, too? Tetsu, that was all about her money. She seemed more and more out of place. She said it was money that you sent. I took her check book and borrowed about three million. (30,000 $) How about using this to pay off my debt? We didn't find out anything. Mother may not have mental problems, after at all. But I will continue to look for her. Please help! Please help! Please help! (Looking for mother: Ezure Tetsu) (64 years old, 157 cm tall) (Bus stop) Oh! It's been a long time. Where have you been? Me? I went here and there. I went to too many places to remember. With whom? With whom did I go? Anyway it was really enjoyable, the happiest time in my life. The bus is not coming. Better just walk. Before setting out let's take a picture of you. If I don't take pictures I forget everything quickly. Thank you. (Two years later) To the success of the Minnesota 24 business! And to your health and prosperity! Cheers! Cheers! Thank you! President, a phone call from Shinji-san. Shinji-san? According to my employees in the Kitami branch, someone like Tetsu-san has been seen there. It's hard to imagine that she has survived two winters. Do you want to try your luck? Hello you! Someone has been looking for you everywhere. Excuse me. They really opened on the night of the full moon. Okaeri nasai, Otosan. Tadaima. It has been a long time. Here it is! Here it is! (Ezure) Finally. Thank you. Seitaro? Seitaro! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Seitaro, look! This is sakura. I always wanted to show it to you. This is what mother worked hard to plant. Look! Do you see? Flower buds reflect the tenderness of spring. Stand up in the branches. Blooming in all colors. Proud fragrance. Softness. When the flowers bloom, no matter who is looking after you, we are here for you. Sing a song of praise. Do you know who gave birth to you? Do you know the loving and caring person? Now you dye the sky a fine red colour when the flowers bloom. No matter who is looking at you, we are here for you. Sing a song of praise. Carrying an irresistible destiny the cherry petals fly with the wind. Soaring without fading, awesome yet beautiful. A fleeting moment. When the flowers bloom no matter who is relying on you everyone is there for you. I'm deeply moved in my heart sheding warm tears!
