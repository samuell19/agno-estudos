Come on in, and I'll make you some bacon. (PIG SQUEALING) The DMV issued 162 new driver's licenses to males in Freddy's age range. Out of that stack, 93 of them poor bastards is married. So of the single dudes, 47 of 'em is Caucasian, and a whole of 28 around 6 feet tall. Well, any of 'em got blue eyes? - Grand total of two. Well, what about them? Why don't we start with them? - Already did. Well, at least the first one. - And? - That sorry son of a bitch still lives with his parents. But the other one- this one right here- one Frank C. Miller, blond, blue-eyed, 6 feet and change, the same Mr. Miller who just ordered cable and a phone line at his new house outside of Houston. And previous address unknown. That's not bad for a pig farmer. Well, when I crack this case, I might just let you frame the headlines, framer. Best way to find out for sure- call him. No, I want to take a look at him first. Come on, you cranky old bastard. Just call him up. - I ain't calling him. (ENGINE DRONING) - That's the house right there. That's not the color I pictured. Well, we're not even sure it's him yet, are we? No better time than the present. You make it sound like it's some kind of showdown. - Well, in a way, it is. I have to make- - Watch out! (CARS CRASHING) - Ah! Shit! - Damn! - What the fuck? (DOG BARKING) Jesus! What in the dog shit is wrong with you? Don't you have any mirrors on this damn Pinto? Do you know how to use them? Who's gonna pay for- we could split it. - Ah! Oh! - You-ah! - Hey! (DOG BARKING) You want some of this? Huh? (KNUCKLES CRACK) - (GRUNTS AND GROANS) - That's for my car. And that's for my hat. Ben, check him. God damn. Tore my fucking head off. (POUNDING) (BARKING CONTINUES) (DOORBELL RINGS) It ain't Frankie Miller, is it'? - No, smart-ass. - Huh Good thing he wasn't in an OK Corral mood.

There are a lot more tapes where that one came from. Doesn't that matter to you? - Well, yeah, it matters to me. But we can't tell Ben about any of it, not yet. - About what? It ain't nothing we need to jump into right now. - What's on the tape? (SIGHS) - What's on the tape? - Do yourself a favor, hoss. - What's on the tape? Huh? How do you work this fucking thing?

They know what their boy is doing. He is protected. - But he's killing women. Prostitutes who cross the border illegally, and nobody cares. - How long you known him? - We were in Korea together. He saved my life. He never said he was in the service. - (CHUCKLES) I don't know whether you've noticed it or not, but old Ben ain't much on the small talk, is he? - (CHUCKLES) - Stubborn as a mule, though.

(BIRDS CHIRPING) (GUN CLICKING) (GUNSHOTS, GLASS BREAKING) I got cows in that pasture. What are you gonna do when a dog goes bad on you, bites somebody or hurts somebody? There's only two things you can do, right? You either chain him up or put him down. But which do you think is more cruel? Huh? You talking about killing your own son? That's crazy. - Well... I can't very well chain him up, can I? (GUNSHOTS) - I need a drink. (LIVELY MARIACHI MUSIC) Haven't even had my goddamn coffee yet. Son of a bitch.

I was worried that you were just gonna wing it. - You got a better idea? - Not yet. But I'm working on it. Just remember, he's my son, and I'm pulling the trigger.
