## These top five floors house the Los Angeles County Jail, where 40,000 prisoners are booked yearly. This building contains the world's largest sheriff's office. The man in command joined the department in 1907 and has been sheriff since 1932. His name, Eugene Biscailuz. No one is more qualified to discuss the confidence game swindlers and their menace to the country than Sheriff Biscailuz. Would you believe it? People are still buying the Brooklyn Bridge. Yes, even as recently as this year. It's hard to believe but true. However, the usual victims are successful citizens who have been bilked through the subtle craft of a person they trusted. Were they stupid? Not at all. We all accept people at face value. Civilization couldn't tick if we didn't. And that is exactly what the confidence operator takes advantage of. He exploits this trust and confidence between people. The bunco games shown in this picture have all been pulled in one form or another. They can happen to you, so beware of newfound friends who offer you something for nothing... get-rich-quick gimmicks, questionable schemes or confidential tips. Here is a mug book filled with pictures of con game swindlers and bunco artists. Look at 'em. Sooner or later, they all end up in a book like this, imprisoned and penniless... the inevitable pattern of all their careers. It all began very inconspicuously back on April 10, 1950. Just around the corner from Times Square, a man entered the offices of an insurance company. I have an appointment with Mr. Sheridan. Mr. Sheridan? Mr. Roger Kingsley, The Kingsley Detective Agency, is here by appointment. You may go right in. Thank you. Mr. Kingsley? Yes. You mentioned Mary Webb's name on the phone. Just what's this all about? As you probably know, she's one of the slickest confidence women who ever operated. Yes, since we talked, I've looked into the matter and I found we've paid out some pretty heavy theft claims on her account. And since you are one of the biggest indemnity companies, I imagine a large share of her take came out of your pocket. Probably so. I've tried to reconstruct her career. Now, here's a partial list of some of the stores she's taken. Hmm... this girl has covered quite a lot of territory. Come into my office. Thank you. Sit down. Thank you. That's why the local police haven't been able to cope with her. She breezes into a city, pulls a job, grabs a plane, and a few hours later she's in another city hundreds of miles away. Just why have you taken such a special interest in Mary Webb? Because I figured the indemnity companies would have a special interest in seeing her caught. But indemnity companies very rarely employ special investigators... you know that. On the other hand, every time she takes one of the stores that you insure, it costs you ten grand and up. Even so, we're only one of dozens of indemnity companies that have paid off claims because of Mary Webb. I realize that, but I've got a pretty direct lead that she intends to take the Royal Department Store in Los Angeles... tomorrow. Hello, Ted? Yes, sir? Do we hold a floater on the Royal Department Store in L.A.? Yes, we do. I thought so... thanks. You're pretty thorough, Mr. Kingsley. I made it my business. What's your proposition? If I gamble the time and money to catch this girl, is it worth 10 grand to you? I don't know. What can you lose? If I don't nab her red-handed, I'll have to retrieve the merchandise before you pay me. I'll have to think it over. I can make the 4:00 plane. If you accept my proposal, I'm taking it. Here are my police credentials. I've had a detective agency here for many years. You can check that. By 9:00 the following morning, Roger Kingsley was in the office of the Los Angeles Chief of Police. He had a letter of introduction. "To whom it may concern: "This is to confirm the employment of Roger Kingsley "by this concern for the purpose of apprehending "a confidence woman named Mary Webb. Any cooperation will be appreciated." So you're a special investigator, eh? That's right, I work for the Arlington Indemnity Company. Flew in this morning and came directly here. You must be onto something pretty hot to bring you this far. I am. Have you ever heard of a confidence girl named Mary Webb? I can't recall her name right off, but we probably have a bulletin on her. We believe she's in Los Angeles. That's why I'm here. Oh, this is very interesting. You don't know how interesting. We've been tipped off that she's gonna take the Royal Department Store today. Is this dope reliable? I think so. At least it's the first break we've had. Anything we can do to help? Not yet, thanks. I'll work along with the store detective until we make the arrest. By the way, maybe one of your boys would give him a ring for me. Oh, sure, we'd be glad to. Thanks... I'll report to you on my progress. Oh, and Kingsley, when you make the arrest, phone us. We'll send a team out from the Wilshire station to bring her in. Don't worry, I will. Within 18 hours from the time Roger Kingsley had his meeting with Andrew Sheridan, he was in the Royal Department Store, starting his first move toward the capture of the elusive Mary Webb. From what you've been telling me about this Mary Webb, the gal must have style. You've got to hand it to her. And she has. I guess she's pulled about every con game in the book. This department store routine's only one of her tricks. Well, I've been a detective for a good many years but I've never heard of anything like her. You sent for me, Mr. Walsh? Oh, yes. This is Miss Seabury. She's the head of our fur department. This is Mr. Kingsley. He's come out here from the East. He's looking for a girl named Mary Webb. Show her the picture. She specializes in furs, expensive ones. $15,000 and up. Kingsley's been tipped off she intends to visit you today. How jolly. We want you to circulate this photograph among your saleswomen so that they'll be familiar with the girl's face. Don't worry, we'll spot her the minute she shows up. She won't get away with anything here. Oh, hey, now, just a minute. That's not the idea. We wanther to steal the coat. What? Exactly. That's our reason for alerting your salesgirls, so that they will leave the way open for her. To steal a coat? Of course. We don't want to run the risk of scaring her off. But what about the coat? Well, naturally we'll nab her as she leaves the store. You must understand that technically no crime has been committed until the thief is actually outside the store... With the stolen merchandise. I'll go right to work on it. Be sure to return that card to me, please. I will. What's her gimmick? It's always the same pattern. Sweet, gray-haired old lady comes into the store... An accomplice of course. Of course. The old lady asks to be shown furs, then... I like this coat, I like it very much, but I want to see everything you have before I make my final choice. Certainly, Madame. Of course we don't carry many coats in stock of this value. Just a minute, my dear. Would you mind leaving that coat here? Very well. It will help me make up my mind if I can see them all together. Certainly. I'm afraid that would be too short for my wife. Do you think you can find something a little longer? Certainly. ## May I be of service to you? No, thank you, I'm just browsing. This is one of our very best... Oh, well, I'll bring you a mink... ## Just a minute. You're under arrest. Call the police, ask them to pick us up. Right. ## Now I shall have to wire my new boss, Mr. Sheridan, with doleful regrets that Mary Webb has slipped through my fingers. By the narrowest margin. Shall I send your regards? My profoundest gratitude. She pulled a gun on me, got away. Got away? Don't worry, I'll get her. Have the police put out an alarm. Change that to emergency... she got away. Taxi! Johnny Gregg's Chiffon Club. You've got a nice place here, Johnny. Thanks. How's it coming? Okay. Everything'll be ready by Saturday. Oh, what'll you have? Scotch and soda, thanks. You're sure nothing's been overlooked. Well, you can check everything against your letters. They're in my desk. I've got a copy of them here. You see, Johnny, there mustn't be any slip-ups in this deal. This is where we hit the jackpot. I hope so. It's taken more money than we've estimated. We've got to start rehearsals tomorrow. How many operators did you get? Four. Only four? Well, that's all I could trust. But I wrote you we needed ten. Oh, well, anyway, I've got three reliable guys coming from the East. One's already here. That's really beautiful. Looks expensive too. I can prove it... the price tag. Here are the ads. Johnny's been giving me the lowdown on this little scheme of yours. Yeah? We must start running these tomorrow. We've got to make this the biggest premiere that ever hit town. What do you think of the layout, darling? Oh, sensational... simply sensational. "Introducing Lazuli, the girl with the extrasensory perception. "She will astound you, she will baffle you. She will frighten you, she will shock you." And she's going to begin right now. What do you mean by that? I assume you're planning on my being Lazuli. Naturally. You're the only person in the world who could pull it off... you know that. I'm afraid it's not my cup of tea. Here's the shock, Roger... I can't help you on this one. What's that? Oh, she talked the same way before we pulled our first job. She came through then, she'll come through now. I wouldn't be too sure about that. But it's the sweetest racket he ever hit on. It's worth a million bucks. This is what we've been waiting for. This is it, Mary. Then why did I have to get the lowdown from Johnny? I'm sorry, baby. Oh, by the way, I have to report to the police. The police? Aren't you getting a little old for practical jokes? Next you'll be down to a dribble glass and a boutonniere that squirts water. Hello? Get me Chief of Detectives Brownell, please. Just what is this all about? Hello, Chief Brownell? This is Kingsley talking. I want to check on the Mary Webb situation. Yes, that's right, it happened just as Walsh told you. She had it concealed in her bodice. You know what happens if you frisk a dame and she doesn't have a gun on her. Anyhow, I'm following up a hunch. Okay, bye. Now, what gives? Don't you know? Roger was the mastermind. He covers all the angles. He sounds as though he's getting a little too cute. Look at it this way, Johnny. Being anchored like this in one city is dangerous. Yeah, but... But I've got a way of playing it safe. I must admit it's brilliant, really brilliant. Thank you, darling. As long as I know what the police know about the ubiquitous Mary Webb, there's not a thing in the world to worry about. It's too risky... I don't like it. This time, Kingsley, you've gone too far. As a matter of fact, not far enough. Oh, yeah? Remember I'm supposed to be following up a hunch? So? So I'm going to prove that I've picked up her trail. Come on, Mary. Where are you going now? To Markwell and Company. See you later, Johnny. This new swindle was planned as usual with efficiency. Kingsley had even made a flying trip out to Los Angeles so that all details could be checked personally. Pardon me, may I please speak to the owner? Why, certainly, madam. Just a moment. Thank you. This was just one more step toward the big scheme. That's what was important about it, not the quick buck they'd make. This way, madam. Thank you. How do you do, Mr. Markwell? I'm Eleanora Havermayer. How do you do? Won't you sit down? Thank you. As you probably know, I'm a concert violinist. Oh, yes, yes, of course. Um... cigarette? Yes, please. What can I do for you? I would like to look at some of your violins. You mean to say you want to buy a violin here in a pawn shop? I guess it does sound odd. But you see, every time I'm in a new city, I make it a practice to visit all the leading loan companies in the hope that I may run across a really fine old instrument. I'm afraid you won't find anything like that here, Miss Havermayer, but come along, let's take a look. Good. Who knows? Perhaps someday I might find an undiscovered Amati or a Guarneri or even a Strad. You never can tell. A friend of mine once found a genuine Rubens in an East Side junk shop. Well, here are two, and I have two more here. Only four violins? Well, as a matter of fact, I have quite a few, but as long as the owners keep up the payments, we can't sell them. Oh, I can tell at a glance that these two aren't what I'm looking for. I'm sorry you don't have a larger selection. Well, it's good merchandise, it moves quickly. Just another fiddle. Sorry, that's all I can offer you. Look, I'm leaving town tomorrow. While I'm here, why can't I just look at the other violins? Say, that's a thought. Probably most of 'em will never been redeemed anyway. Jean, get out the violins. Charlie, give her a hand, will you? If I'm lucky enough to find what I'm looking for, you can always send it to me later. Yes... well, here they are. We have quite a selection. I should say so. You must know a lot about violins, Mr. Markwell. Oh... Which one did you lend the most money on? Well, I wouldn't take that as any criterion, Miss Havermayer. We're hardly experts, you know. Wait a minute, I think I found something. Look at that scroll. Oh, it's really old. I can tell by the varnish. No one's made a violin like this in over 200 years. Listen to that. Oh, it's what I've been looking for. I've searched a long time for a fiddle like this. And unfortunately I can't sell it to you. But I've got to have it. Well, there's not much I can do about it. Well, can't you see the owner? Can't you try and buy it from him? He may not want to sell it. How much would you give for it? $10,000. $10,000? That's exactly what it's worth to me. Well, of course, that's different. I'm sure it can be arranged. I'll write you a deposit right now. What'll I make it, a thousand, 1500? Whatever you say. A thousand would be fine. Very well. You can contact me at the Beverly Wilshire, but you have to attend to it right away because I'm leaving town in the morning. I see. If you're unable to complete the deal, which I hope won't happen, you can return my deposit to me at my New York address. "Miss Eleanora Havermayer, Park Avenue." Please phone me just as soon as you have some news. I will indeed. Thank you... goodbye. Goodbye. Say, that's a top address. And I'll bet that coat set her back at least 15 grand. Yes, I noticed. Anyhow, this check's on a local bank. I don't want to take any chances, so get down there as quick as you can and see if it's good, and stop off at the Beverly Wilshire, see what you can find out about her. Right. Well, the check's okay, Mr. Markwell. The bank certified it. Good. And the girl is not only registered at the Beverly Wilshire, but she has a deluxe suite. That's all I wanted to know. Kingsley's contact with the police was important, but to keep it alive, he would have to supply a fresh interest, like proof that he really was on Mary Webb's trail. Mr. Markwell would unwittingly supply this proof... also some ready cash. It was a neat trick if he could do it, and Kingsley thought he could. Pardon me, are you Mrs. Mallory? Why, yes, indeed. Did you wish to see me? Yes, I'm Paul Markwell of the Markwell Loan Company. May I come in? Of course you can! Thank you. Oh, William, this is Mr. Markwell of the Markwell Loan Company. How do you do? How do you do? It was so nice of you to come out and see us. Won't you sit down, Mr. Markwell? Thank you. Would you like some tea, Mr. Markwell? Oh, I don't want to put you to any trouble. Oh, it's no trouble at all. I always keep a kettle on the stove. It'll only take a minute. Very well then, thank you. You must pardon all these papers, but I dabble a little in poetry. Oh... uh, Mr. Mallory, I'll come right to the point. We have a customer who might be interested in buying your violin. Well, that's a coincidence, Mr. Markwell. I was gonna come in today and pay back the $200 we borrowed on it. I have the money here. Now, wait a minute, Mr. Mallory. I think I might be able to get you nearly $500 for that fiddle. But we weren't thinking of selling it. Well, it's more than twice what we loaned you. You must understand, Mr. Markwell. My father was a musician. It was his violin. Naturally you have a sentimental attachment to the instrument... I'm afraid, Mr. Markwell, we couldn't possibly consider parting with it. Oh, but... Now, Mr. Markwell, I'd like to ask your opinion about a piece of poetry. It's called "List' to the Lark." This is how it goes. "List' to the lark, on the wing again, "Or in the meadow, down in the glen, "Winging his way to his feathery love, While fluffy pink clouds go gliding above." Or do you think I should use "fleecy pink clouds"? What do you think I should do with it? I hesitate to say. Use your own judgment. As a matter of fact, Mr. Mallory, our customer was quite taken with that fiddle. I think under the circumstances, I might get her to go to... ...a thousand dollars, cash on the line. Oh, Mrs. Mallory... I just offered your son a thousand dollars for that violin. What do you think of that? Land sakes, that old fiddle's not worth half that much. I think our buyer is crazy too, but, oh, that's her business... here. Would you mind? Oh, very well. Thank you. I don't know, Mother, what do you think? We can't take that kind of money for it. I wouldn't feel honest. Oh, now, don't you worry about that, Mrs. Mallory. All we have to do is to get you and your son to sign this bill of sale and the thousand dollars is yours. One lump or two, Mr. Markwell? Oh, two, thank you. By the way, Mr. Markwell, going back to that piece of poetry I read to you. I wish you would help me make up my mind whether to use "fluffy pink clouds" or... All right, all right, I'll double the offer. But that's my limit. And believe me, that is a lot of money. But here it is. Now, Mrs. Mallory. You know, Mr. Markwell, this is all very confusing. When I obtained the loan on the violin, your man distinctly told me it wasn't worth a penny more than $400. Oh, he was quite right. I don't know why the customer wants it. Just a whim. She's a rich woman. Now, Mrs. Mallory... It just occurred to me. As she is so rich and there's no market value to a whim, perhaps she'd willing to... To pay more? Exactly. Are you trying to hold me up? Now, now, Mr. Markwell, how could he be? When we made it quite definite we do not want to sell? Raymond was merely philosophizing. Of course, Mother. Let me give you a fresh cup of tea. Think what you could do with $2,000. Oh, but, Mr. Markwell, my dear husband's memory cannot be evaluated in terms of money. Indeed it can't, Mother, indeed it can't. ## Well, I had to pay $8,000 for that violin. Oh, we still make a $2,000 profit. That's not bad for one day's work. Hello? Uh, hello... Miss Eleanora Havermayer, please. Uh, hello, Miss Havermayer? Just a moment... Mr. Markwell wants to talk to you. Miss Havermayer? Well, I've got that violin for you. It was a big struggle, but I got it. Seems the owner knew all along it was a rare old violin worth at least $15,000. What?! You don't want the violin?! She's changed her mind. But, but you've got to take it. I paid $8,000 for that violin. You can't get away with this. You can't get away with this, you... She hung up. I traced her as far as Seventh and Hill and then lost the trail. Yeah? Several witnesses saw her enter a large office building on the southwest corner. So Mary Webb's at it again, huh? She didn't waste much time. Here's one for the books, Kingsley. She pulled another job right under our nose. A pawnbroker named Markwell came barging in here and claimed that some woman had taken him for eight grand. That certainly makes everything check. I certainly gotta hand it to you. You were at least one jump ahead of us. But still one jump behind Mary Webb. You better detail some men to watch the depot and the airports. They can recognize her from these photographs. How long will it take you to have them reproduced? Oh, just a few minutes. We have a well-equipped laboratory. The photographs were of a blonde, all right, but the blonde was not Mary Webb. Even the fingerprints were of another girl, taken in the morgue, name unknown. You can see from the photographs Mary Webb is just another blonde. Markwell should identify these photographs. There's a call in for him now. We needed more facts. Let's drop in on Lieutenant Fenton. He's chief of the bunco squad. Then he should be in on this. Lieutenant Fenton's office. I have Mr. Markwell on the phone for Lieutenant Cobb. Just a moment, he's coming now. It's my guess she's going to lay low for a while. Here in Los Angeles? That's just a hunch. I hope so... it'll give us a break. Lieutenant Cobb, Mr. Markwell is on the phone. Oh, I'll take it. Hello, Markwell? This is Brownell, Chief of Detectives. I have a special investigator here named Kingsley. I'd like you to talk to him. Here you are. Hello? A young woman has just bilked me out of $7,000. What did the girl look like? Well, she was tall, dignified, intelligent. You say she was a short, dizzy blonde. Markwell just described Mary Webb perfectly. She's our girl all right. No, you misunderstand me. I said she was tall and dignified. I've got all that. Yeah, but you said... Don't confuse the issue. Exactly what did she do? But she wasn't short. I have no time to argue. Well, the girl came into my office and wanted to buy a violin and gave me as a deposit $1,000. Oh, and the check bounced. Well, no... as a matter of fact, it was perfectly good. Well, then what did she do? Go on, Paul, tell him. Well, I paid $8,000 for that fiddle and she refused to buy it. Now we're getting somewhere. Her accomplices sold you the fiddle and claimed it was worth $8,000. Uh, no. What did they say it was worth? Well, they admitted it was only worth about $400, but... You're a pawnbroker... you should know what it's worth. Yes, matter of fact we had a loan on it. How much was the loan? Uh... $200. Exactly what was that fiddle worth? What's the matter with you? Well, of course it was only worth about $400, but... In spite of that, you paid $8,000 for it? Why, yes, but... Brother, you don't need a detective, you need a psychiatrist. What did the detective say? Oh, maybe it's best to skip the whole thing. How about a drink? But you said the girl had robbed you. That you wanted to put her behind bars. Oh, yes, but you know the old adage. Live and let live. I don't understand. Well, it looks as though this time Mary Webb operated just within the law. The public should be alerted to these kind of things. If they were, these contemptible crumbs like Mary Webb couldn't get away with it. Let's go. Give the story to the reporters and tell 'em to run it... and all the details. Lieutenant Fenton? This is Mr. Roger Kingsley. Mr. Kingsley.Lieutenant. Quinn? Yes, sir? You should be in on this. This is Mr. Roger Kingsley. Sergeant Quinn. How do you do? Glad to know you, Sergeant. The sergeant's Lieutenant Fenton's assistant. He's just been on a case in your city. Yeah, the boys been telling me about you. You work for the Arlington Indemnity Company? That's right. It's a little puzzling. I've never known any of the indemnity companies to employ a special investigator. That's because the indemnity companies have never known anyone quite like our friend Mary Webb. Sit down, Kingsley. Still, they've always been perfectly willing to rely on our local police force. This is hardly a local matter. You see, Mary Webb rarely stays in one city any length of time. Or in any one country, for that matter. What's on your mind, Quinn? Oh, nothing, it's just strange that I've never heard of her, especially since she's pulled so many jobs. I've been with New York bunco for the past few months working on a case. Oh, she uses many aliases. For instance, were you there on February the sixth of this year? February sixth... yes, I was. On that day, she took a Madison Avenue jewelry store for $12,000. Well, I've got a file on all the bunco cases while I was there. You mind if I look it up? No, of course not. You wanna come in the other office? We're wasting a lot of time horsing around. Here's a record of just about every job she's pulled in the last six months. Three days ago, she was operating in Cleveland. Houston last week. Rio before that. It's all here... you can see for yourself. Well, you don't mind if I take a look at this file anyway, do ya? Hey, Chief, Kingsley's right. A blonde woman tried to sell an emerald necklace. The jeweler appraised it at $12,000. Then she went across the street for a competitor's appraisal. It's the old switch routine. Yeah, then she returned a few minutes later to take up the first jeweler's offer but she'd substituted a paste necklace for the real one. And, as it was an exact replica, the clerk didn't bother with a reappraisal. First thing I want you to do, Fenton, is pick up Mary Webb. Now, you two fellas get down to business and see what you can do about it. Yes, sir. Okay, Chief. Lieutenant, can I see you a minute? You know, that Fenton's a smart cop. He doesn't take to Kingsley. Wonder what's on his mind. Get Walsh on the phone for me, will you, please? Well, for a private eye, this bird Kingsley is certainly thorough. Very. Imagine the fantastic amount of work it took to backtrack on the career of this globetrotting girl. Oh, thanks. Hello, Walsh? Say, this is Brownell speaking. How long was it between the time Mary Webb made her getaway and Kingsley took off after her? Are you sure it was that long? Okay, that's all I wanna know. Nothing, forget it. Say, there's a curious thing. Even at 30 miles an hour, a car would go three-quarters of a mile in a minute and a half. Yeah... how could Kingsley have picked up her trail? Yeah... that's not all. How could he stop to telephone me while he was trailing the girl? What about it? And yet he tracked her down to the very building where she robbed Markwell. Just to play it safe, wire the New York Police Department and tell them to thoroughly check this fella. Okay. To make a day like this possible took weeks of meticulous planning, and part of those plans included a fashionable house in a fashionable neighborhood. Well, darling, for the next two months, this is your home. Roger, why did you lease such an expensive house? I had my reasons. Won't the police think it's rather sumptuous for a private investigator? I have a room in a cheap hotel. I call in for my messages. So help me, Maggie, you look like the real thing. Well, that's a dubious compliment. I must say, you showed excellent taste. And tenacity. I got the guy down nearly a hundred bucks a month. Good for you. Have a look. Well, how do you like it? Quite a layout. These paintings are lovely. They're by an artist named Bouguereau. I fell in love with them myself. What a sweet child. Let's see the rest of the joint. Oh, the library's in here. Come on, Mary. The master bedroom's in here. What's in this room? That's the nursery. They have a little kid. Look at this room, Roger. Isn't it adorable? There's a large pool and tennis court out in back. You can see it from this window. Well, I've got to get dinner started. Fine. Come on, I'll fix a cocktail. It's nice living in a house at night. I haven't spent a night in a house in a long time. A very long time. Pullmans and planes and hotels. All one-night stands. Silver, gold dishes and an atmosphere of charm. That's for you... you were born for it. "She played the part as though she were born for it." I read that once in a corny review. Prosaic, I admit, but nevertheless true. You and gracious living blend together like candlelight and crystal. You should set that to music. And you did. And all this, darling, is just setting the stage for your future. To Lazuli. To Lazuli... the girl with the extrasensory perception. And her psychic powers tell her that when you set the stage, it all adds up to just so much scenery. Roger... what's the gimmick? Gimmick? Could be that you want to give me a taste of what money can buy. For instance? To lull me into this Lazuli deal. Would I have to be that devious? Roger, I don't know. Just how do you intend cashing in on this scheme? Johnny didn't tell me that. Lazuli is bound to be a sensation. The club'll be packed. You make a million dollars in 60 days? No, darling, let's have it straight. Later. Now. Okay, Johnny and I got a hold of a lot of bum copper stock and we want to unload it. At a handsome profit. Correction... a fabulous profit. No, thank you, I'm not hungry. Nor am I. So you pulled one out of the files. The old clairvoyant stuff, no less. The jokers ask for private readings. They trust Lazuli, they believe in Lazuli. And Lazuli recommends the copper stock. Of all the rackets, my streamlined version required the most brains. And the least conscience! And that should be scored with "Hearts and Flowers." Perhaps you'd prefer to go back to your fiddle playing. Perhaps I would! Even on a street corner with tambourine accompaniment. Can't you see, Roger? It's bad enough taking these indemnity companies, but when it comes to bilking people out of their life savings, that's where I draw the line. Oh, look, we live only once. Life's pretty drab at the best. For me, I'm gonna squeeze all I can out of it. Regardless of how you do it. Yes, regardless. Which is better, this life or playing a fiddle for the drunks in some East Side dump? Living in a stinking two-bit room. Garbage pails in the hall. Cockroaches, blaring radios, squalling brats. Squalling brats? Well, listen to this, Roger. I'd rather have a kid in that crib upstairs than all this pomp put together... if I could call it mine and give it a name. But I told you, we'll get married as soon as we hit the jackpot. And this Lazuli scheme can do it. One more scheme. One more scheme, one more scheme. Yet every penny we take in goes into keeping one jump ahead of the police. A one-way ticket on an endless chase. But this time we'll make a pile. We'll get married... you have my word. Your word. You haven't any intention of ever getting married. No matter how much I love you, there has to be an end to what I can take. And this is it? Yes... I'm tired of stringing along. I won't go for the Lazuli deal. You can count me out. Is that your final word? It's an ultimatum. Darling, I can understand why you think I'm a louse. I can't blame you. Leave me alone. Look, I'd like to have a kid too, a smart boy I could be proud of. But let's face it, what right do we have to bring a kid into the world as long as we're in this racket? Then we can get out of it. And struggle along on the precarious pay of a private dick? Other people get by, and besides, I can get my job back. Do you think I'd live off you? You're doing it, aren't you? We're partners, we're working together. Look, you've strung along with me so far. All I'm asking for is 60 days more. 60 days and that's it. No. Did anyone ever tell you you're a pretty wench? I bet I look awful. Baby, you look good to me. Even with streaky makeup and a red nose. Oh, Roger. "Tonight at Johnny Gregg's Chiffon Club, "the world premiere of Lazuli. "She will shock you, she will amaze you, she will frighten you." What hogwash. Anyway, you fellas are planning on going over there tonight, aren't you? Yes, we're gonna leave right away. Anything Johnny Gregg is in bears watching. Especially if he gives a buildup like this to a mindreading act. Say, by the way, we got a report from the New York Police Department. Yeah? They investigated and Kingsley is a private dick and he does work for the Arlington Insurance Company. Well, that's that. No, not quite. The report is probably on the lieutenant's desk. There appears to be nothing significant in his background, but the report states that he had a girlfriend who worked in a nightclub on the East Side. So? So, she played the fiddle. Oh! The girl who took Markwell played the fiddle. Well, there could be a connection, but it's plenty remote. Anyway, I asked them to try and dig up a photograph of the girl. Good. Now let's go see what our friend Gregg is up to, huh? Hmm... Well, Sergeant Quinn. How are you? Fine. I suppose you're looking for your sidekick, Lieutenant Fenton? That's right. He's right over here in the corner. Hi, Lieutenant. Sorry I'm late. I wrapped up that Briggs thing all right. Well, boys, Lazuli goes on in a few minutes. You're just in time. How fortunate. Maybe not so fortunate for you, Gregg. You know how downtown feels about these phony mindreading acts. You better watch your step. And perhaps, Sergeant, you better watch yours. Bye now. He's a fresh punk. Wonder how he got all these celebrities to show up. Gregg's no dope, Lieutenant. He advertises dinner for $25 a plate. So naturally when he hands out free invitations, the suckers tumble for it. Ladies and gentlemen. Unfortunately, most so-called mediums are merely tricksters who possess no psychic powers whatsoever. They usually rely on a photographic memory, having first made inquiries about their subjects in advance. They have stooges in the audience or an assistant who speaks to them through a prearranged code. Or invisible writings or whatnot. This is a new wrinkle. That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I take such pleasure in presenting a young lady whose extrasensory powers are not only real, but transcend anything within the memory of man. Tonight will go down in history. Ladies and gentlemen, I present Lazuli. Ladies and gentlemen, this is my first public appearance and... quite frankly, I'm nervous. I, I hope you will be patient with me. What's she doing, trying for audience sympathy or what? Sure, it's showmanship... makes her act more believable. Mm-hmm. I'm having difficulty concentrating. There are so many hostile minds out there, I, I can't seem to get through. She's scared to death. Oh, I feel sorry for her. I'm sorry, this, this is embarrassing. Is she kidding? Well, I must say, she impresses me as the real thing. Oh, I do hope she comes through. Wait a minute. I just received a flash. There are four people at a table way over there. One of them is a brunette lady in a dark red dress. She is very antagonistic toward me. Madam, would be kind enough to write your name on a slip of paper? I need your concentration. Of course, madam, what you have written is "I think you are a complete humbug." Is that not right? It's a neat trick. That it is. Your name is Gertrude... Gertrude Palmer... and you're with your husband Frank and your friends Joey and Alan Ridgeway. Frank had lunch today at the Biltmore Grill. He meet an old pal, Captain Payson. You went on a shopping tour. You bought a new hat and it cost... $35.40. Alan is carrying a silver cigarette case that you gave him for Christmas in 19... 40... 1945. It's inscribed, "To my darling." Is all this correct? Yes, it is. Girl's clever. There's no denying that. I could rattle on like this for hours but I'm afraid I have a serious message for you, Alan. You and Frank were college chums together at Hanover and you consider Frank your very closest friend. Is that not so? Why, yes. In fact, you're both employed by the same concern, the Lipton Advertising Agency, and you, Alan, have worked out an ingenious advertising campaign with which you hope to land an important Cleveland account. Why, yes, I'm planning to leave for Cleveland next week. You have discussed your ideas with Frank. He knows all about them. Frank has also told you that he's leaving tomorrow morning for a vacation at Tahoe. Is that correct? Yes. This is embarrassing. Tell her to skip us. Alan, I'm sorry to tell you, but the Palmers have no intention of going to Tahoe. That's not so. Now lay off of us. I'm going to give it to you straight, Alan. You'll find out soon enough anyhow. Frank is not your friend. How dare you! You're going too far! This afternoon Gertrude purchased two United Airline tickets to Cleveland. She paid $465.25 for them and they're for flight 210 leaving at 8 a.m. tomorrow morning. I regret to tell you this, Alan, but Frank and Gertrude intend beating you to Cleveland to steal the account right out from under your nose. That's a lie! If that's so, Gertrude, how do you explain the tickets? They're right there in your pocketbook. So help me, Lieutenant, she seems almost on the level. Oh, all these clairvoyants are phonies, you know that. I know but... A young girl over there seated with her parents has a message for me. Is that not right, Hilda? Why, yes, Lazuli, that's true. You recently lost your husband. It happened while you were on your honeymoon and you have created a vision of him in your mind. Yes. The night before, you were both on the beach, gay and happy. He was strumming a ukulele. You made up a song. Is that correct? Yes, Lazuli, yes. You have written the song down... the music is in your bag. You called it "The Song of the Shell." I seem to be getting an impression of the melody. It is sad, plaintive, but very sweet. Lyrics start this way. "Listen again to the song of the shell." Am I right, Hilda? "Tells of a wave in love with a dune." That's right! This beats me. Yeah. No one, absolutely no one but Carl and I have ever heard that song. Oh, you must be getting the melody from him. Please understand, Hilda, that I'm not in communion with your husband. Only sadistic charlatans make such cruel pretenses. What I have received, I have received from your mind. It is reality, it is scientific. Just how scientific, the patrons had little idea. Now to go back to the very beginning, to the time that the Palmers and Ridgeways first arrived at the Chiffon Club, and show you how it was done. The first step was for the parking attendant to pick up fragmentary remarks. The attendant then searched each car thoroughly for any bits of information he could find. The hat check girl caught additional scraps of conversation and even rifled coat pockets for further data. The headwaiter made a mental note of any useable information he overheard. Reports from all these sources were continually being conveyed by phone to the central clearing office, which occupied the whole floor above the restaurant. Here the customer information was segregated and catalogued according to table numbers. The data gathered from the employees supplemented their main pipeline: small microphones concealed in the table lamps. Each table mike had its own plug. The operators were trained to linger only on conversations of value. In this way, an astounding amount of personal information was unwittingly revealed. For instance, the dope regarding the Palmers and Ridgeways, with the exception of the cigarette case inscription and plane tickets. They were spotted through dummy flush ceiling lights, each contained a pane of glass transparent from the operators' side but opaque from the patrons'. It was in this manner that the operator also read Gertrude's note, the information being relayed to the clearing desk. Even the ladies' lounge was vulnerable to the prying eyes of an operator. It was while Gertrude Palmer was freshening her makeup that the Cleveland tickets were revealed. And in the same manner, Hilda's "Song of the Shell" was discovered by an operator who knew enough music to copy down the melodic line. The mastermind, Roger Kingsley, was the coordinator. It was by combining the various bits of dialogue and information picked up that he was able to piece together the facts. She's onstage, let's go. Start with Table 14, the girl in the red dress is named Gertrude Palmer. She's very antagonistic. Kingsley's message was picked up by a compact, battery-operated walkie-talkie set hidden by Mary Webb's dress. A wire running inside her clothes connected with a button-sized receiver in one ear. Madame, would you be kind enough to write your name on a slip of paper? I need your concentration. Wrote, "I think you are a complete humbug." She wrote, "I think you're a complete humbug." Of course, madam, what you have written is "I think you are a complete humbug." I just phoned your hotel for messages. There's an urgent call from the police. You're to go there immediately. Johnny. Yeah, be right there. The girl is Gertrude Palmer. Her husband is Frank. He's with his closest friend, Alan Ridgeway, and his wife, Joey. Take over. Start here. I'll be back as soon as I can. Okay. Frank had lunch today at the Biltmore. He met an old pal, Captain Payson. Oh, there you are, Kingsley. Brownell wanted to see you. Where is he? He's working on a murder suspect. They just brought the guy in. Will he be long? I don't know. You can go down if you want. Thanks. All right, son, tell us just what happened. I got off work at Douglas at about 10:00 and thought on the way home I'd drop in and see Betty... Miss Blake, that is. How long have you known her? Just a few weeks. Well, go on. When I got to the apartment, I poured her a drink. She took a sip and I poured a drink out for myself. Then she collapsed, writhing on the floor. And then you called the manager of the apartment house, is that right? Yes... Betty was in pretty bad shape by the time he got there. He sent for a doctor but it was too late. Cyanide killed her. How did it get in the whiskey? I don't know, maybe she put it in when I turned my back. The girl didn't commit suicide. The cyanide was in the bottle. Besides, we found a receipt for a new dress, bought today. Here's a letter we found in her desk. It's to her sister. "I got that new job I wrote you about and everything's working out swell." Those aren't indications of suicide. Where'd that bottle of whiskey come from? I brought it. You brought it? Hello? Let me talk to Johnny. Okay, I'll wait. Where'd you buy the liquor? I didn't buy it. I was walking past Rooney's Bar when a guy came out and handed it to me. Who was he? I don't know, I never saw him before. You mean to tell me that a complete stranger made you a present of a $5 bottle of whiskey? Yes, yes, that's the truth, that's how it happened! All right, all right, take it easy. Johnny, quick, don't ask any questions. Has Mary started on Lieutenant Fenton yet? No. Good, I've got a message for him that'll put Lazuli in the headlines. Now get to your mike. Hello, Mary. Roger's on the phone. He's got a dynamite idea for you. It's for Lieutenant Fenton, he's as Table 42. He's head of the bunco squad, he's out to get you. Now listen, here's the dope. Those two grim-looking gentlemen in the far corner of the room are Lieutenant Fenton and Sergeant Quinn of the bunco squad. I have the impression, Lieutenant, that you are still skeptical of what you have seen tonight. Is that correct? Correct. Maybe I can change your opinion, Lieutenant. Supposing I tell you what is happening at this very minute in your chief's office down at headquarters. That I'd like to see. Me too. They just brought in a young boy for questioning. His name is Speel. He is suspected of having given a lethal dose of cyanide to his girlfriend, Betty Blake. As a matter of fact, Chief of Detectives Brownell is questioning young Speel at this very moment. The young man claims that the bottle of liquor was given to him by a stranger in front of Rooney's Bar. Your friend Brownell thinks that Speel is lying. He can't understand why a perfect stranger should make this young man a present of a bottle containing cyanide. I'm afraid Mr. Speel is in a rather serious predicament. May I suggest, Lieutenant, that you phone and verify these impressions with Chief Brownell. We certainly will. Go ahead. Roger, Fenton's gone out to phone Brownell... hang up. 524, please. Hello, Chief, this is Quinn. Look, don't think I'm nuts, but are you questioning a murder suspect named Speel? Oh, I see. How did I know? I wouldn't dare tell you. Well? You're right. Now I've seen everything. Ladies and gentlemen, that's all for this evening. I'll get it. Chief Brownell speaking. Oh? I see. You say that this man who so generously gave you this bottle of whiskey was short, wiry and had a bushy head of hair, is that right? Yes... I didn't get too good a look at him but he gave me the bottle and I went on. Mm-hmm. Rooney's Bar is still open. Two detectives questioned everybody in the joint. No one there remembers seeing a man of that description. But there are a lot of people in and out of the bar. Just because nobody remembers him, that doesn't mean anything. Except that it leaves you holding the bag. The cyanide in the bottle killed the girl, and unless you can prove where you got that bottle, you're in a pretty tough spot, young fella. I tell ya, I know nothing about the cyanide. Sit down. Was Betty Blake two-timing you? No, she didn't mean anything to me. Were you jealous of her? No, I told ya, no! Why don't you come clean? I didn't do it, I tell ya, I didn't do it! Lock him up. Look... if I had intended to murder the girl, would I have called the doctor, would I have stayed there and waited for the police to come? And would I have come up with such a lame alibi as to where I got the bottle? He has a point. He's got a good point. Makes a lot of sense. You're impressed with it. A lot of people would be impressed with it. You know, I think you're a pretty smart kid. Maybe even smart enough to have figured that all out in advance. But I hardly knew the girl, and I can prove that. You'll get a chance to prove a lot more than that. Think it over. Let's go. What do you make of this? Oh, I don't know. It's a puzzler, all right. The drugstores'll have a record of every person who bought cyanide. Chief Brownell speaking. I want every available man to call all the drugstores and bring in anyone who made a purchase of cyanide in the last year, and I want them here by 12:00 noon tomorrow... right. I'm sorry, Kingsley, I've been so long getting to that Mary Webb matter. We're both tired... why don't you let it go till tomorrow? That's a good idea. If you don't mind, I'll come in shortly before noon. I'd like to tag along on this Speel case... it interests me. Okay. Oh, Chief, can I see you a minute? Sure. Excuse me. This Lazuli over at the Chiffon Club called the turn on this Blake murder right while you were questioning Speel. She did? That's right, chief. Any reporters in on it? No, nobody but our own boys... and Kingsley. Kingsley? Yeah, I sent for him. Oh. Well, we'll talk about this tomorrow. Good night, fellas. Good night, Chief. You know, if the Chief himself hadn't sent for Kingsley, I'd, I'd swear he had some connection with all this. Oh, now, wait a minute. All right, then you tell me. How did Lazuli get this dope? Kingsley was the only outsider here. If she got anything from Kingsley, she'd have to be a psychic to end all psychics. He might have phoned it in. How? She was right there on the stage in front of us all the time. I don't know. Well, I don't know, either. But Kingsley is the only man that was in New York... All right, all right. Well, I know one thing. She played the fiddle, the girl who took Markwell played the fiddle, Kingsley's girl played the fiddle... everybody plays the fiddle. All right, so it's a coincidence. Sure, and it was a coincidence that Kingsley could call almost the exact hour she'd take the Royal. And it's another coincidence that though she had a three-quarter-mile lead, he was able to track her down to Seventh and Hill. I don't know. You saw the police reports, mug shots of Mary Webb. She definitely is not Lazuli. Oh, it's enough to drive you screwy. But the whole thing may be solved like that. Yeah, how? When New York sends us a photograph of Kingsley's girlfriend. The house is swarming with reporters. Yeah, we're having a devil of a time keeping them away from you. They want a statement. To find out whether young Speel is guilty or innocent, I suppose. Naturally, and we got a break. Speel's sister called and asked for a private reading. Oh, no. What do you mean, "Oh, no?" It's terrific. Don't you see? We told her that if she'd come down to the club tonight, you more than likely would get some impression that would be helpful. Boy, wait till the reporters get a load of that. Oh, but it's cruel. Be sensible, Mary. This might even put us on the front pages! It's a cinch it would if Lazuli could give Speel's sister some inside track that even the police don't know. Boy, that would really set the town on its ear. Oh, no, wait a minute, wait a minute. It isn't enough he pretends to be a cop. Now he wants to outsmart them to boot! I did all right for you last night, didn't I? As a matter of fact, I have an appointment with Brownell in a few minutes. Look, how far do you think you can stretch your luck with these cops? Now lay off, will ya? You talk to him, Mary. I don't think anybody can tell Roger anything. We're doing plenty all right as it is. Do you know I had to put on two extra operators at the club last night to answer the calls, and do you know why? Because the suckers are clamoring for private readings. So they really fell for it. And in droves. I tell you, after last night, this town is a pushover for our copper stock. We'll hit our mark in 60 days. This thing's really snowballing. Just hold tight, Mary. How about it? I agreed. Now I must go back to playing cops and robbers. So long. The guy's got a nerve. That he has. While the audacious Roger Kingsley was endeavoring to establish the murderer of Betty Blake, the New York Police were endeavoring to establish the identity of Mary Webb. Your boss around? No, he comes in after 7:00. How long's he had the place? Oh, about a year. Were you here before that? Yeah, why? About a year and a half ago? Maybe... something wrong? Remember a blonde girl, a violinist, she used to work here. The one that called herself Yvette? Perhaps. Well, she wasn't here very long. I don't know anything about her. Just a minute. I want a photograph of the girl. I'm sorry, I can't help you. Well, there should be a display photo of her. Maybe there's one still around. I doubt it. You got any suggestions? Well, there's a lot of junk back there in the closet. Thanks, I'll take a look. Sullivan talking. We've covered every drugstore. Four men have bought cyanide in the last year. They're here now. Good... send for Speel. Let me know as soon as he comes down. Would you mind if I go along on this meeting with Speel? Not at all. Kingsley, I'm sorry I crossed you up last night, but I was trying to arrange a meeting with Markwell. The pawnbroker? Yes, but when this Speel matter came up, I had to call it off and I couldn't reach you in time. You see, Lieutenant Fenton was supposed to cover this case. What's the purpose? Well, we have no proof that the girl who took Markwell was Mary Webb. But it was certainly her type of operation and I traced her to the same building. Well, it's a hundred-to-one shot that it was Mary Webb, but we've got to have positive proof. Of course. That's probably Markwell now. Speel is here. We're waiting for you, Chief. I'll be there in a few minutes. Why don't you go ahead and let me handle Markwell? And when you get through, come on in. Mr. Markwell's here, sir. Send him in. This way, Mr. Markwell. Mr. Markwell got tied up at the last moment and sent me. I hope that's all right. Quite all right. We wanted Mr. Markwell to identify our photographs of Mary Webb. Oh, I can do that, sir. I remember her very well. Bring in the photographs of Mary Webb. Never mind, Chief, I have a set here. Oh, that's the girl, all right. I'm sorry, Chief, but one of these birds says he's just got to get back to his business. I'm coming. She's very pretty. Thanks, fella, you did us a good service. Come along. Looks like the Series'll go the limit this year. Don't kid yourself. The Yanks'll take the next three games and sew the thing up. Oh, yeah? The Giants have got a new team this year. We're gonna show you three men, Speel. I want to see if you recognize anyone as the bird you claim gave you the bottle of whiskey. All right, fellas, let's go. Come on. Face front. Face right. Face right. Face right. That's him... the guy in the middle. He's the one that gave me the bottle. All right, step down. Upstairs, you two. What's your name? Pope, William Pope. He's the guy, I tell ya. I'm the guy that did what? You gave me that bottle of whiskey last night in front of Rooney's Bar. The boy's nuts, I never saw him before in my life. What is this, some kind of a screwy frame-up? All right, Pope, let's have it. Why'd you put the potassium cyanide in the bottle? Potassium cyanide? What are you talking about? Dr. Braddock admitted buying it for you. For me? I never even heard of Dr. Braddock. Now, wait a minute, Pope. You're not gonna get anywhere this way. Dr. Braddock is one of the most respected dentists in the town. I don't care who he is. If he says he bought any cyanide for me, he's lying in his teeth, and I'll tell him that to his face too. You'll get plenty of chance to do that. Lock him up. What for?! Suspicion of homicide. Well, looks like we got our man. On the contrary, I think we're deeper in the dark. I'm pretty sure Pope gave the bottle to the boy. His protests sounded kinda phony to me. He is a lousy actor. You're right. That's why I think he was on the level about not knowing the doctor. His rage seemed genuine. Let's bring Dr. Braddock in for questioning. No, no, not yet. I want to get a little more evidence first. Get out a warrant to search Pope's house. Question his wife, intimate friends. Find out anything you can, but remember, I don't want any of this to get to the newspapers. We've checked Pope's record, Chief. He's been arrested half a dozen times on burglary. Always been let go on insufficient evidence. How come? A mouthpiece named Richard Downs had a particular interest in the guy. I'll see you later, Chief. Right. Oh, Lieutenant. What's the gag regarding this fellow Downs? He was a crooked lawyer with a thousand tricks up his sleeve. We always thought he planned the robberies for Pope but never could prove it. Hmm, I see. I'd like to have my teeth cleaned. I wonder if the doctor could fit me in? Well, did you have an appointment? No, I'm afraid not. Well, what's your name, please? Roger Smith. Oh, I'm afraid the doctor's pretty well filled up today. Well, I'm just killing time between trains. I may as well wait here as at the station. It might be quite some time. Who recommended Dr. Braddock to you? Uh, one of his patients the last time I was in town. For the moment, I don't recall his name. Well, you just have a seat. Thank you. You may go in now, Mr. Pringle. Say, I believe I remember that name now. Does that doctor have a patient by the name of Pope? Pope? No... no, I'm sure he doesn't. Now I know. I had Pope confused with someone else. The name I was trying to remember is Downs, Richard Downs. Oh, yes, of course. Mr. Downs has been a patient for quite some time. In fact, Dr. Braddock and Mr. Downs are old friends. I see. Well, I have a couple of errands I can do. Why don't I take potluck after lunch? That's a good idea. I think your best time will be about 3:30. Thank you. See if you can find the phone number of Richard Downs. What are you up to? Brother, something plenty hot. I got a tip down at headquarters today and jumped the gun on Brownell. I get it. What did you find out? Nothing definite, it's a hunch, just a hunch. But if I'm right, Lazuli may have something sizzling to say tonight. Like? Like naming the guy who put the cyanide in the bottle. What? Say, that would be out of this world. Everything depends on whether I can get this bird Downs to come to the club tonight. Here's that number you wanted. Arizona 9-7248. Dial it for me, will you? Right. If this Downs is our baby, we might pick up some dope on the mikes tonight that'll cinch the case. Uh, hello? Just a moment, please. This Richard Downs? Hello, Dick. A friend of yours asked me to call you. He doesn't want his name used but you're in trouble. I suppose you read in the papers this morning about that clairvoyant who's been calling the shots on the Betty Blake murder? What's that got to do with you? Plenty, pal. Your friend got a tipoff that tonight Lazuli intends to connect you with the murder. If you're smart, you'll be at Gregg's Chiffon Club tonight to protect yourself in the clinches. So long, Dick. You think it'll work? I think it will. I want all the spot announcements on the radio we can get. Television too, if possible. But I don't get it... the club's booked solid. The more Downs hears, the more worried he'll get. The more worried he gets, the more likely he'll come. That's a good one there. We'll say that Lazuli promises to follow up her startling revelations of last night with even more sensational disclosures on the Betty Blake murder. Well, it's 10 after 12. We can't hold up the show any longer. There's no sign of Downs yet. No? Well, I guess we'll just have to get along without him. Don't worry, dear, we've still got a lot of dynamite. Anyway, Speel's sister's been here for several hours. She's at table 14 with her lawyer. We've picked up quite a lot of dope already. Well, that'll help. Come on, Mary. Downs is here. The parking lot attendant found his name on the registration slip of his car and the attendant also found a pistol concealed in the glove compartment. Hey, Downs and that guy with him are being seated at Table 43. Come on. They're ugly-looking customers. They frighten me. Okay, let's get going. We'll feed you the dope as it comes through. All right. Ladies and gentlemen, I present... Lazuli. I'm trying to clear my mind of the impressions that keep crowding in. It is the answer to young Hal Speel's guilt or innocence that I am trying to concentrate on. Speel's sister phoned me at the hotel today and promised to be here tonight. Yes, she is here... definitely here. I see the picture of a very attractive brunette in a gray suit. There she is, sitting with a gray-haired gentleman. He is an attorney. She has engaged him to defend her brother. I know my brother didn't murder that girl... I know he didn't. Please, please, Lazuli, will you help us? Of course... I'll do all I can, Peggy. I have some very good news for you, Peggy. I feel a positive vibration that your brother's innocence will be proven. When, Lazuli? When? Yeah, that's what I'd like to know. Very soon... tomorrow. Tomorrow? I seem to feel the vague impression of a wiry little man. He has steel-gray hair. He had a mustache but it is shaved off. His name is... It's beginning to come to me. Pope. Yes, that's it, Pope. William... yes, he's the one who gave your brother the bottle of liquor. Then... then Pope wanted to murder my brother. He put the poison in the liquor. No... no, he didn't. I, I don't understand. It's confusing, very confusing. The poison was intended for Pope. That's the impression I'm getting. The bottle was given to Pope. He gave it to your brother to get rid of it. Go on, Lazuli. Please go on. Now, wait a minute. You could have gotten this information through some pipeline on our police force. If you can really pull these things out of the air, tell us why Pope gave the bottle to Speel. I'm not on the witness stand to be cross-examined, Sergeant Quinn. I can only give you the impressions as I receive them. I do not know why Pope gave the bottle to Speel. I only know that he did. It could have been because Pope didn't like whiskey, or perhaps he wanted no gifts from the man who gave the liquor to him. Then there was another man, and he gave the liquor to Pope. Is that it, Lazuli? Of that I am sure. Who is this man? What's his name? Let me see you answer that one. I'm afraid that's all I can give you for the moment. I'll pass on to someone else. There's a gentleman at the table to my left. Now, that's one way to get out of it. But my brother's life is at stake. If you know who this man is, please, please tell us, Lazuli. I must admit, I don't have much confidence in this sort of thing, madam. But if you can help this girl's brother, it's your duty to do so. I'll try. That's it, darling, you're doing great. The more you can make Downs sizzle, the better chance we have to get something out of him. My impressions are out of focus. They're, they're vague, they're indistinct, they... they come and go like flashes of light. Then can you tell us why this man wanted to murder Pope? That might help. Yes, it's beginning to come to me. It's because Pope was involved in some robberies. And this man, the murderer, I mean, had inside information which enabled him to plan the robberies for Pope to execute. He felt that Pope knew too much. He wanted to get him out of the way. And that's why he gave him the bottle of liquor. It's not very clear, but that's the way it comes to me. How did she get all this? I don't know. You're on the right track... Downs is cracking. You've got Downs going. Now's the time to strike. Here's the dope on the dentist. You know who the murderer is, Lazuli. You do, don't you? For my brother's sake, you must tell us... you must. But I can't... it would only be an impression. It wouldn't prove anything. I can't stand here and accuse a man of murder, not without any evidence. Then you do know, you do. I told you, Peggy, you don't have to worry. Your brother will be cleared tomorrow. Of that I am sure. But if you won't tell us why, how can I be sure? Because the police will question a certain dentist tomorrow. His name is Braddock. That's it... Dr. Braddock. Dr. Braddock will admit that he bought the cyanide for the man who put it in the bottle of whiskey. Well, then, why did Braddock tell the police that he bought it for Pope? Because the murderer did not tell Dr. Braddock that he was buying the cyanide for himself. He said he was buying it for his friend Pope, who wanted it for an insecticide. But Lazuli, I don't understand. It formed an alibi for the murderer. If Pope died from cyanide, it would seem accidental. Oh, but how? How can we ever prove all this? Dr. Braddock will confess. That will break the case. You know what to do. His address is 435 North Flower Street. Get going. Downs just told his friend to go to 435 North Flower Street. Said, "You know what to do." What did he mean by that? I don't know. Mary was talking about Dr. Braddock. Could it be that...? I was thinking the same thing. Give me that phone book. The parking attendant just reported that guy tore out of the lot in Downs' car. And remember, there's a loaded gun in the glove compartment. Yeah, here it is. You were right... that's the address of Dr. Braddock's house. I better phone the doctor and warn him. No, that's no good. Downs and Braddock are friends. That's right, Braddock wouldn't believe it. He'd think it was a gag. Well, it's a cinch if we don't do something, Braddock'll be bumped off. We're in trouble. That fellow with Downs has gone to get Braddock. We must get Fenton to stop him. Wait a minute, something serious has happened! A man has just left this restaurant. I don't know why I got this flash, but he's on his way to kill Dr. Braddock! We must act quickly to save a man's life! Listen to me, Sergeant Quinn. You must phone to send a squad car to intercept this man. He's in a green Cadillac and he's headed for Dr. Braddock's house at 435 North Flower Street. You expect me to arrest a man just on the say-so of a phony mindreader? You must believe me. If you don't act now, a man will be killed! You trying to make a fool out of me? This mindreading stuff is just a racket. Believe me, what I'm saying is on the level. Fenton's trying to trap you... don't fall for it. I called the turns last night, didn't I? Look, it was a trick then and it's a trick now. If this man's life is really in danger, then give me some tangible evidence. Tell me how you got your information. Don't say another word. You've gone too far already. What did she say? Tell you on the way... hurry. If you're withholding any concrete evidence, you're endangering a man's life. Ladies and gentlemen, Lazuli is exhausted. She cannot go on. You must excuse her for tonight. That is all. ## Roger, what'll we do? Get out of here. If we go now, Braddock'll be killed. So what? If you don't want to spend the next couple of years in jail, come on! But don't you see, Roger? If I can save a man's life and I don't do it, it'd be like killing him myself! Well, what are we, his wet nurse? He got himself into this mess. It's his worry, not ours. It's a man's life! I can't let him be killed, Roger, I can't! You're coming with us. It's bad enough what you asked me to do to those people out there, but murder, that's something else. We're not the ones that are killing the guy. It depends entirely on how you look at it. I'm going back. You'll do nothing of the kind. Let me go. ## A car can get from here to 435 North Flower Street in less than 15 minutes. If you're on the level, you better make it snappy. All right, Sergeant, you win. I'm Mary Webb and this is all a fake. We had microphones hidden in the table lamps. That's how we picked up the information. And I can tell you something else, Sergeant. The man who killed Betty Blake is Richard Downs and he was sitting at that table right over there. Don't worry, we'll get him. ## Al, this is Quinn. Yeah, put out an all-points bulletin and pick up Richard Downs. Right... thank you. ## I want you to know I'm gonna go to bat for you. There's even an outside chance you might get off with probation. Thanks. It doesn't matter anymore. You ready? Mm-hmm. ## Tell you what, Sergeant. Why don't you phone for the squad car and, um... let me hold the prisoner? I got news for you, Kingsley. There's an "s" on the end of the word "prisoner". And here's something you can add to your souvenirs. Nice likeness of Mary Webb, don't you think? Remarkable. Came in on the wire service from New York. Got it this morning. We've known about everything you've been up to. Oh, darling, darling. All right, let's go. It might interest you to know that Lieutenant Fenton has Dr. Braddock in protective custody. We've got two men staked out at his house. See, it's difficult to prove a poison murder. We thought with your hocus pocus here at the club, it'd be a good way to get the goods on Downs. I guess I had you pegged from the start, Kingsley. Let that be a lesson to you, Sergeant. Always play your hunches. And so, on April 20, 1950, just ten days from the point at which the story began, the careers of our two "master swindlers" drew to their inevitable close. ##
