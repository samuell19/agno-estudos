"He who believes in me will live even in death "and every living person who puts his faith in me "will never suffer eternal death."

You who raise the death to life give our brother eternal life. We ask this in faith. Lord, hear our prayer. Let us pray. Lord Jesus Christ, of the three days you lay in the tomb you made holy the graves of all who believe in you and even though their bodies lie in the earth they trust that they, like you, will rise again.

(ALL GASPS) Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. (WOMAN SOBBING) Expensive embalming, Frank. Cuff 'em. Father, it looks like you're going to have to continue alone. He's state's evidence now. Let's go. Come on, Frank (INDISTINCT TALKING FROM DISTANCE) FRANK: Hey, I just buried him, Mitchum. You got a law against that too? Hey, these cuffs are cutting me, man. MITCHUM: You'll live, Frank. Hey, hardo, did you hear what I said? I said... Hey! Keep walking! Come on, you little pussy! (LAUGHING) Hey, hey, Vic'll have us out in 24 hours, man. Yeah, don't bet on it. Vic's kind of tied up with the grand jury these days, in case you haven't heard. Get in and shut up. This is Connie Wayne of Action News here on the steps of the federal courthouse, awaiting the appearance of reputed mob overlord Vic Luca. This is the final week of his federal racketeering hearing. Controversy centers around the disappearance of three key government witnesses, all former associates of Mr. Luca. The latest to disappear, Vincent Carelli, was discovered yesterday, his mutilated body stuffed inside a garbage truck. He's coming now. MAN: Right this way. Out of the way. REPORTERS: Mr. Luca. Mr. Luca. Mr. Luca. REPORTER: What do you think, what do you think... VIC: Hey, one at a time, all right? Let's take some shots for the album, okay? Everybody, cheese. There we go. Thank you. Mr. Luca, would you care to comment on your hearing? Honey, you call that a hearing? You know, I call that a three ring circus in there. They got animals, jugglers, even got a couple of clowns. REPORTER 2: Mr. Luca, you made the cover of Time last week. What do you think of the article? (CHUCKLING) Well, that was, that was kind of amusing, wasn't it? I mean, where do they dream up some of this stuff? You know, they wrote that I wear thousand-dollar suits. Well, I'm gonna tell you, this is gonna cost 1,800 bucks anywhere. You don't seem to be taking this hearing very seriously, Mr. Luca. You do face life in prison. All I'm facing is harassment, Connie. The prosecution has not brought forth one witness. They had three witnesses, Mr. Luca. They disappeared. Well, maybe they got stage fright. Connie, I'm just an honest businessman. I'm being persecuted because some of these feds have got this half-baked, crazed idea that there's a thing called the Mafia. Well, I wanna say something about that. I'm gonna quote Mr. J. Edgar Hoover. There is no Mafia. End of quote. (SCOFFS) You hear that, you guys in the FBI? Mitchum, I'm throwing you forward. I'm giving you a challenge. (INDISTINCT TALKING) I want the fucking judge. Vic, you know how hard it is to touch a federal judge these days? Gravenstein, I don't care how hard or how much. I just want you to buy her. Hey, why else would I hire one of you's to get me off, huh? 'Cause you don't know any smart Italians. Eh? I'll see what I can do, Vic. That's better. (PHONE RINGS) Yeah. I'm on my way back. Why? What? Gosh! Goddamn Mitchum. He picked up Frank and Abe. God dammit! Hey, Dad, shoot some hoops? (CHUCKLING) Son, I'm whipped. Why don't you come up here and help me patch this roof? Nah. Hey, someone's moving in. Yeah, I noticed that. Maybe they got some kids your age. Sure got a lot of cars. Dad, we need to talk. What's the matter, Son? You got a problem? Come on. What is it? Ever since I won the karate tournament the Sensei's been matching me with bigger guys. It just make you stretch, pushes you a little. Makes me hurt. Yeah, can I see that. If I'm gonna fight bigger guys, I need bigger offense. Yeah, I agree with you. Don't say anything to your mother, huh? Come on. KENNY: Maybe I should just kick 'em in the nuts. COLLINS: Maybe. CHRIS: Oh, these are definitely you. They really are. (GIGGLING) You're tickling me. Why don't you walk around in them? Okay. Twinkle toes. Oh, you. How do they feel? Oh... They feel wonderful. Just wonderful. (PHONE RINGING) And the bunions? It feels like I'm walking on air. (LAUGHING) WOMAN: Chris, it's Dr. Johnson. I'll take it in back. Excuse me for a minute. Oh, you. Why don't you write up a sale for her? Okay. Yeah? What's up? JOHNSON: I want to place another order. Two pairs, this time. Yeah. (LOUD WHIRRING) These two guys are lost in the desert sea, right? Both of them starving to death. They spot this dead vulture. I mean, all dead and covered with maggots. This first guy eats the vulture. The other guy, he can't believe this. After about two hours the guy upchucks the vulture and the other guy smiles and he says I knew if I waited long enough I'd get a hot meal. (LAUGHING) Oh, Jesus! (LAUGHING) Oh, God! (COUGHING) Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh. (CHOKING) That guy in cell block "D," still trying to fake that sickness of his. It's your turn to check it out. What do you call a midget fortuneteller who escapes the joint? (MOUTHING) A small medium at large. A small medium at large. (LAUGHS) Oh, God. Hey. (GRUNTS) Hey, wait, wait. I got another one. Save your voice, Fasio. Yeah, you got to do a lot of singing tomorrow. (CHUCKLING) Now, that's funny. That's a real fucking joke, you know. I wouldn't laugh. Either you or Vic are gonna spend a long, long time in here, old man. I suppose you still believe in the fucking tooth fairy, too, huh? I'm gonna get some coffee. (GRUNTING) (SCOFFS) Caleek! I knew Vic wouldn't leave me here. Listen, what do you call an 89-pound Ethiopian? I heard that one. (GROANING) Oh! Oh, God! REPORTER: (FROM TV) Connie Wayne is standing by... Tom, can I talk to you outside, please? Shut up. From a high-ranking source that Frank DeSalvo, Vic Luca's right-hand man, has been placed under federal protective custody. What the hell is this? DeSalvo will testify against the reputed mob lord. A second witness, Abe Fasio, was assassinated last night despite all efforts. What's this shit doing on TV, huh? Who the fuck is this high-ranking source? I don't know anything about this. Somebody does! They know you assholes are hiding me! What if they know where you're hiding me? I got a kid in there! That's it. You ain't keeping me here 'cause I know the law! You've broken every law that there is. Oh, blow it out your ass, you fed. Fuck you. Son of a bitch. Stay out of this, Jared. You hear me better now? Fuck you, man, you cock sucking... You hear me better, Frank? It's taken me three years to get Vic Luca in front of a grand jury. So, help me, you gonna testify. Good luck, Mitchum. Good luck? Yeah, I feel like I got a horseshoe up my ass, Frank. You're gonna help me nail this guy, or you're gonna do time, and we're taking about hard time and just maybe, maybe I'll help you and your son out from under all this. You leave my son out of this. Hey, Mitchum, what do you want me to do? You want me to end up like Abe or one of the other guys on Vic's hit list? Your work means dog shit to me. I ain't testifying. Okay, smart ass, you're calling the shots. I can't make you testify. Now you got it right. See, Frank DeSalvo don't snitch on nobody. I don't give a damn about you. But I do care about that little boy in there and I want you to think about something. You're going to be doing 10 to life, Frank, San Quentin. He's not gonna have any mother, nobody. Now you fucking think about that, okay? Dad, all they got is microwave pancakes. Come here. They ain't got no microwave. It's 'cause these guys ain't got no brains like I told ya. When can we go home, Dad? It won't be long, son. Your dad's got a few things to take care of first. Right, Frank? Then can we go home? You're gonna have a new home. You're gonna have new friends, new school. Your dad is even gonna have a new job. Hey, let's go see if we could find some sugar and we'll eat the thing soggy. Uncle Brian. Hey, tiger. Look at the trophy I won. That is out of sight, man. I always knew you had it in you. You know, your dad tells me that some big guy's been picking on you at school. Don't worry about it. One of these days I'm gonna have to teach you some moves. That kid won't even know what hit him. Yeah. Totally cool. (BRIAN LAUGHING) Brian! Hello, Sandy. How are you, sweetheart? I'm good. Good to see you. Listen, can you stay over? I thought you'd never ask. Okay. (CHUCKLING) Come on, kid. Let's go inside and talk some business. KENNY: All right. Well, honey, did you bag anything? What else you got? See the, uh, color TV has just come in, 200 of 'em. Hmm. Remote control? I don't think so. You don't think so, huh? You don't think so? What are you, stupid? Everybody wants one with remote control. How am I going to move this stuff without remote control, huh? Shit! You stupid! Okay. I'll tell you what, you take 'em over to East LA and you sell 'em to wet backs. They're too scared to bitch about being fucked. What else you got? We got 350 VCRs and food. We got lots of food. Steaks, champagne, caviar, shrimp... I want all that stuff out of here by tomorrow, all right? No problem. (COUGHING) Well, it's a sad story. They belonged to a guy who owed me money and he couldn't pay it. So, he had an accident. You know I, I need a hotel about like a bull needs tits, but, uh, I've enjoyed using his credit. We ordered all this stuff, hardware, liquor, cars. Hey, you want a caddy, huh? Clean. It ain't hot. I got the pink slip. We got any fucking thing you want around here. Stuff comes in the front door and it goes out the back. Keep that going until his credit snaps. Then maybe this place is gonna have an accident, you know? It looks pretty good now, but, uh, the wiring's kind of shoddy, you know? We collect the insurance. It's beautiful. Look at this guy. You know why he's smiling? He loves to steal. Huh? If you gave this guy a million dollars and say, "You can't steal," he'd be very unhappy. He'd come along, whack you in the head. He'd steal the million dollars and make him very, uh, very happy. Yeah. Very happy. When my people are happy, I'm happy. My people are unhappy, I'm unhappy. If somebody makes me unhappy, I send for you. BRIAN: So, how's the insurance business? Well, I got a promotion. I'm the new western division supervisor. Christ! If you don't watch out, they're gonna have you in the rotary club. (BOTH LAUGHING) Hey, you know, pal, maybe you better start putting away some money. For what? Well, you might be a Godfather. That's a mighty expensive proposition. Congratulations. (INDISTINCT TALKING FROM TV) My old friend Abe ends up as a doorstop. (LAUGHING) VIC: Power is a... It's a double-edged sword. When you get it, you think that the struggle's over but only that's when the real war begins because then you got to keep it. Everybody wants it. They want to take it away from you. You ever heard of, uh, Machiavelli? No. Is he from around here? Sixteenth century Italian statesman, philosopher, advisor to emperors. Machiavelli knew something about power, how to hold on to it. He told it like it is. Nail 'em before they nail you. You don't care about stuff like that, do you? What do you think of this guy? He don't want a Cadillac, huh? He never heard of Machiavelli, huh? Shoe salesman. He gets off on a different kind of power. Here's another old friend of mine. Frank DeSalvo. Yeah, I've known him since he was a kid. Real good friend. Here's where they got him hiding out. Nail him. Hey, my name's Kenny. What's yours? Frank. Do you wanna shoot some hoops? Sure. Come on, kid. Back up. Hey, tiger! Give me some five. Hey, do you always sleep this late? It's nearly noon. Hey, man, I'm an old man, I need my sleep. (SHRIEKING) Hey, who's this, Bruce Lee? You're a regular little ninja, ain't ya? Yeah. All right. Tell you what. Let's go around back and work on it some more. (KENNY GRUNTS) All right. On the left. Block. No, no, no. Come on. Come on. Keep that elbow in. Protect your face. All right. Here we go. Here we go. Block. Good block. All right. Block. (GRUNTS) Good. Good. Good. All right. What you looking at? What are you watching? Shoulder to waist. Shoulder to waist. Keep your eye... Oh! Keep your eye on me. Oh! Woah! What is that? Is that a kick? All right. Let the old man take a break. Come on, Uncle Brian. Teach me some offensive moves. Defense first then offense. That's the way your father wants it. What does he know? I'm the one getting creamed. He just sells us the insurance. Now, you know he knows a lot more than you do, sonny. Come on. Don't sell your father short. He's a tough guy and you know it. COLLINS: Hey. You guys want to ride with me down to the lumber company? I got to get some more shingles. No, I'm not through with this little monster yet. You guys have fun. (CHUCKLES) Come on. Let's go. (ELECTRIC KNIFE WHIRRING) (MUSIC PLAYING) (SCREAMING) (GRUNTS) Hey, don't look at me. Your father, where is he? Where is he? Where is he? (BLOWS) Where is he? Out! I told you not to look at me. COLLINS: Kenny! Kenny! You hear that, Bill? Jesus Christ! Freeze! (SIRENS WAILING) You mind letting me in on what's going on here? Somebody got wrong house, took the wrong kid, killed the wrong guy. What'd you say? Huh? What the hell did you just say? Uh, Collins, we'd like you to go with us. Uh, I'll explain soon as we get someplace we can talk. Who the fuck are you? We're FBI. Well, if you're the FBI why don't you go find my kid? I'm staying with my wife. Mr. Collins, your wife is going to be fine. What we need to do right now is come with us. We've got a few questions... Get your fucking hands off of me. Hold it. Hey, hey. Hey. Let him go, let him go. Now, listen. Calm down. Now, listen to me. Why don't you go inside, get your coat. We'll take you to the hospital to see your wife, all right? Okay? It's all right. It's okay. This guy's gonna be trouble. We got to move DeSalvo. What's that little, uh, hotel on Flowerstreet? What's it called? Starlight? That's it. We'll take him there, okay? Collins, you ready? Don't worry about a thing. Just concentrate on your wife. Officer Burke here will go along with you, make sure everything's okay. Right, Burke? Right. Come on, Collins. I'll give you a ride. BURKE: Watch your head. Soon as he talks to his wife, book him. (SIREN WAILING) Somebody blew it. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Listen to me. Luca sent somebody to whack DeSalvo, right? Right. Okay. Whoever it was, he got the wrong house, couldn't find DeSalvo but they took this kid. Now, think about this. Luca thinks he's got DeSalvo's kid. Well... (COUGHING) Come on. Couldn't you lay off of that? Hey, look, Jared, there's only two things I wanna do before they plant my ass. I wanna nail Vic Luca and I wanna be able to enjoy my cigarettes, okay? Will you lay off? Oh, shit! Listen to me. Hey, listen. Come here. Listen. Now, as long as Luca thinks that he's got DeSalvo's kid, he figures that Frankie won't show up to testify against him tomorrow, right? Yeah. Well, I want him to keep on thinking that. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you saying? That we keep Collins on ice until after the trial so he can't shoot off his mouth to the press and everybody else? Then we find his kid, let him go and everybody's gonna be happy? You got it. Jesus, Tom. It's all Luca to you, isn't it? Look, Jared, you and I both know I got maybe a year left. It's my last case and I got to make it count and there's not a damn thing I can do about it? I know, Tom, but all I am trying to do here is... I know what you're trying to do. Now, let's move the fucking creep, all right? DOCTOR: I think she'll be all right, Mr. Collins. No fractures, her vital signs are stable. She's just sleeping off one hell of a whack on the head. COLLINS: You know, doctor, she was pregnant. She lost the baby. The trauma was just too great. Sorry. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) BURKE: The man's in there with his wife now. She's hurt, his friend's dead and his son is kidnapped. You know what they want me to do, huh? They want me to lock him up while they move that piece of crap across town. GUARD: I can't believe it. They're taking him over to the Starlight Motel. Everything will be okay, baby. It'll be all right. Hey, hold on there, Collins. Collins, I said hold on! (INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT) Well, he wasn't there. But I got his kid. What? You got Frank Junior? Yeah. Okay. Oh, God. That's beautiful. Listen, you take good care of that kid 'cause he's my life insurance. Uh-huh. (LAUGHING) Yeah, suddenly I can't wait to hear Frank's testimony tomorrow. Hey, thanks, man, yeah. (SIGHS) (COUGHS) How's he doing? FRANK: Okay. He's a good kid. He's tough. You want a hit of this? Yeah. Eh... Want some ice? No. You got any kids, Mitchum? No. You married? To the job, Frank, to the job. Yeah, me, too. But I still had a wife. And a mistress and a couple of girlfriends. You're a real pillar of the community, huh, Frank? Now, that's something the kid can really be proud of. Boy, you and me, we're from different planets. See, you don't understand the system. Guys like me and Vic, we could never rat out each other. If you do that, it's worse than dying. It's like you're not a man no more. You got no honor. Honor! That guy tries to kill you. No, he wouldn't kill me. Plus I've known him since I was a kid. He was like an uncle to me. Sure I've seen him smile at guys like, uh, they were his best friend in the whole world. Meanwhile he was digging their graves out back. But not me. Well, he's not gonna be digging anymore graves 'cause he's gonna rot in the joint and you're gonna walk if you're smart. If you cooperate with me, Frank, I'll set you up for life. Sure. And then you, you retire with a lousy pension and you spend the next 20 years walking around playing golf wearing stupid plaid pants. The big hero, the guy who put away Vic Luca. What about me and my kid, Mitchum. We become targets for every hood in town looking to make his bones. Well, yeah, that's a chance you'll have to take, isn't it, Frank? You go upstairs and check. I'm gonna go around back. All right. What the hell took you so long? Oh, leave him alone. It takes time to prepare this gourmet shit. What, greasy burgers, right? My mouth is watering. Well, I stopped by the office. And, uh, Tom? What? The boys got that out of your phone. Vic knows every move we make. God damn those slimy son of a bitches! How long has this been going on? What the fuck is wrong with our people? I don't know. Nobody knows. You mean nobody cares. You got that right, chief. FRANK: I hate to leave your elegant dinner party, but I'm gonna go take a shower and go to sleep. Not a word. Move it out the window. Hey, Vic's got it all wrong, man. I wasn't gonna say nothin'. Move it. Jump. Oh, this is beautiful. QUIGLEY: Tom, come in! Yeah? Tom, this is Quigley. Frank just got away! My name is Collins. You're gonna help me get my son back. Your son? Shit! You're the guy from across the street! You just shut up and drive. I almost wish you were one of Vic's guys. You wanna tell me where we're going? Yeah, we're going to see Vic Luca. You don't just go to see Vic Luca! (FIRES GUN) FRANK: Oh, Christ! All right, I understand. You made it perfectly clear you're upset. But look, Collins, you don't want to bring me to Vic Luca. That's the last thing you want to do. Now, put all five of your brain cells together and just listen to me. Then talk. Nobody tells Vic what to do. You walk us in there, he's going to have me for an appetizer, you for the main course, and your kid for dessert. I'm probably the only guy that could help you find your kid. Stop the car. Pull over right now! Listen to me. If you're not on the level, I'll blow your fucking brains out. Look, I don't know where your kid is... But I know where we can start. Hey, ciao, Joey. Oh. Bellissima. Where's Frank? Hey, you guys are driving me crazy. You're back here every 30 minutes. I've already told you, I don't know where they're hiding Frank. Oh, yeah? How come I don't believe you? Vic wants your motherfucking son and what Vic wants, Vic gets. Understand? (CURSING IN ITALIAN) Fuck you! (SPEAKING IN ITALIAN) You know something, Joey? You don't... Let go of me! (FIGHTING AND SCREAMING) (JOEY SCREAMING) Now, be cool, man, and keep that piece buried. Where the hell are you taking me? Pizza. Pizza? Pizza. You gotta be kidding. You think you're some kind of comedian? This is my father's joint, all right? He hears a lot of things. What the hell? Pop? Pop! Pop! Pop! (SOBBING) Listen, there's nothing you can do to help your father now. I'm sorry. I really am sorry. But they still got my kid! I'll help you get your son... If you help me get Luca. Deal. Where are you, Franky? Where are you? Whoa, whoa, wait. Is that them? That's them. Come on. Hit it, baby. (TIRES SCREECHING) Run the fucks down. Damn, watch out. Come on, baby. Come on! WOMAN ON P.A.: Welcome... Hey, out of the way. Come on. Move! Move! Move! (LASER TAG GUNS FIRING) (GUN FIRES) Over here. (GROANS) (GROANING) Hey! Paulie! (GROANS) What the hell are you doing? That's the guy who knows where my kid is. He ain't dead yet, huh? Oh, Frank. Where's my kid? Your kid? Yeah, Paulie. You dumb fucks grabbed the wrong kid! Now, answer the man! Okay. Okay. Frank, look what you done to me. Caleek's got him. Who the hell is that? (GROANING) The shoe salesman. Vic's hitter. Where's my kid? I swear I don't know! I know the place. He'll be there tomorrow morning. Now just stay cool. We're getting out of here. All right? Come on. Paulie, this is out of respect for my father. WOMAN ON P.A.: Disperse to exit. Disperse to exit. Disperse to exit. (MUMBLING IN ITALIAN) That miserable scumbag bastard, DeSalvo has killed more of my people than I have! Fuck! Vic, take it easy. If he's on the streets, we'll find him. What the fuck are you waiting for? Eh! Find him! I don't give a damn about Collins, but I want DeSalvo's ass in that courthouse, and I want him there by noon tomorrow. Um... By tomorrow DeSalvo could be anywhere. Jared. (COUGHS) Please just do it, all right? Are you sure you're going to make it till tomorrow? Yeah, I'll be there. Go on. Get out of here! And stakeout Luca's hotel. (SIRENS WAILING) FRANK: When I was a kid... I used to work in that pizza joint. And I hated it. But every time I slacked off... My Papi would jump on my case. But I knew he loved me. No matter what I did, he loved me. And I loved him. And we knew it, man. Yeah. Yeah, I understand. Hey. Vic's hitter, he's a sick bastard. A real kinko. Why can't we go after him tonight? I don't even think Vic can get to him at home. But everybody knows where he works. Look, don't worry. As long as your kid's valuable to them... Ain't nothing going to happen. Trust me. You and your kid, you got a lot more to say to one another. Me and my old man, we said it all. We were good. You and your kid can be good. We'll get past Caleek. Caleek. Fucking Mafia. That's just a word. Everybody thinks it's this big, secret cult. Guys run around with mustaches, speaking Sicilian, making you offers that you can't refuse. Well, it's bullshit. There's guys like you, the suckers. With your real jobs, and your pensions, and your two and a half kids. Guys like me. Not just Italians, everybody. The scam artists, the con men, the wise guys. And then there's guys like Vic. Vic's my FBI. He gives me protection. From what, the cops? Cops? Cops are easy. Vic says taking care of cops is like raising chickens. All you need is the chicken feed. Shit. I fed more cops' kids than the fucking police pension fund. The real protection is from other guys like me. We got a certain set of rules we gotta respect. You jump outside the rules, you're in deep shit. Yeah, like taking my kid? Is that outside your rules? Yeah. That's deep shit in my rulebook. You're okay, Collins. For a sucker? Sure, for a sucker. There he is. FRANK: Look at her. I bet you she ain't wearing no panties. If that was me, I'd bang her right there. In front of everybody. I wouldn't give a shit. That's the guy that killed Brian? That's the guy that got my son? Hey, Collins, that guy is so twisted, when he dies, they'll have to screw him in the ground. He's killed so many people, he owns his own cemetery. Let's take him. Whoa, whoa. Do you think he saw us? No, I don't think so. He probably just went in the back for some more shoes. More shoes, my ass. Jesus, Jack, take it easy. I don't give a damn. That son of a bitch has got my kid. I'll tell you one thing. That guy's got brass balls. Look at the plates. You think he's going to lead us to Kenny? Maybe. Maybe not. FRANK: Hey, Collins, your kid ain't here. This is Vic's place. He comes here every morning for his sitdowns. But you know something? This could be good. 'Cause it's the only place where people can walk in off the street and go right up to Vic. We got Caleek and Vic in the same place. Uh-huh. Let's go get 'em. Hey, whoa. Buster bad ass, you are playing in the major leagues here. You do things my way, or you do it alone. This may be your world, but it's my kid. Got it? You are a real dunsky. Yeah, well, fuck you. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Look at this. (GUN COCKS) Christ, he's gonna shoot! All right. Raise up real easy and put your gun on the dash. Come on! Come on, move your ass. Go. Go. Hey, look out. Let's get out of here! (TIRES SCREECHING) Hey, I'd never thought I'd be so happy to see the feds. Sorry about your dad, but we gotta be in court in two hours, Frank. Hey, save us both some time. I'm still not testifying. Let's go. Let's go, Collins, you too. Let him go. He didn't do nothing. What does he mean to you, Frank? I'll tell you what he means to me, wise guy, huh? He don't walk, I don't talk. You got that? Hey, wait a minute. You're saying if... You'll testify if we let this guy walk? Yeah, sure. Walk, Collins. Hey, good luck with that shoe store. Let's go to court, Frank. (CAR ENGINE STARTS) Hey, Mitchum, let's go to court. You miserable, cock sucking bastard. You ain't gonna put me away. (VIC YELLING) Frank ain't going to talk. I'll see you in court, sweetie! FRANK: Where'd you guys get this suit for me, Goodwill? It's embarrassing. MITCHUM: Keep wearing it, Frank, it'll come back in style. I want Caleek. Give me his address. PROSECUTOR : Mr. DeSalvo. .. Would you please tell the court what you do for a living? FRANK: Lately? I've been trying to hide. Before that, what was your job? FRANK: Officially, I was the manager of the Celestial Funeral Home. And as manager, what were your duties? As few as I could make them. (LAUGHTER) He ain't gonna say nothing. PROSECUTOR: Uh, Mr. DeSalvo... What has been your main source of income? I've been real lucky at the track lately. (LAUGHTER) I'm referring to your activities for Mr. Vic Luca. I did a lot of things for Vic. Would you please point Mr. Luca out for the court? Right there. Would you describe, in detail, just what it was you did for Mr. Luca. Whatever he wanted. (GENERAL MUMBLING) Hey, ugly. Eat. Idiot. Eat. Hey, here! Kenny! Dad! Dad? I came for the boy. Who the hell are you? I'm his father, you asshole. His father? You're not Frank DeSalvo's kid? You piece of shit! (GROANS) No, he's my son. Well, go ahead and shoot. I'll break his fucking neck anyway. Go ahead, shoot. Come on, shoot. Dad! Go ahead, shoot. Dad! Come on. He's your kid. Maybe you'll get lucky. Dad! (KENNY SCREAMS FOR HELP) (GROANS) (STRUGGLES) PROSECUTOR: What did you have to do to remain in Mr. Luca's organization? What do you mean? (PROSECUTOR CLEARS THROAT) Let me be more specific, Mr. DeSalvo. Did Vic Luca ever order you to perform any activities which were illegal or immoral? Illegal or immoral? Objection, Your Honor, he's leading the witness. Overruled. I'll repeat the question, Mr. DeSalvo. Did Vic Luca ever ask you to perform any activities which were illegal or immoral? Yeah, he did. Please, continue. About a year, year and a half ago, Vic asked me to go to this certain address downtown where I was to meet a certain person and bring this person to Vic's hotel... For an illegal meeting. Was this person involved, um, in any sector of organized crime? Oh, yeah, prostitution. I see. And was this person, one of Mr. Luca's men... Running this prostitution operation? No, this person was a hooker. Vic screwed her. (LAUGHTER) But the hooker had a social disease and she gave it to Vic, and Vic gave it to his wife. He said he got it from a public toilet. (LAUGHTER) You're insulting my wife. You're dead, you rat. Order! Order! Hey! (FOOTSTEPS) (GROANING) (SCREAMS) PROSECUTOR: Mr. DeSalvo... Vic Luca is reputedly... One of the largest heroin importers in this country. Do you have any knowledge of his involvement with narcotics? I'm with Nancy Reagan. I just say no. (LAUGHTER) Mr. Prosecutor, you don't seem to be communicating with your witness very well. Now, we're going to take a short recess, and you'll try and talk some sense into him. This hearing will recess for five minutes. (GROANING) (LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) Hey, Frank, I knew you wouldn't say nothing. I ain't even started yet, Vic. Jerk. You know what's going to happen to that kid of yours if you say one fucking word, you know. Vic, cool it, huh. Your salesman, he fucked up the house call. He grabbed the kid from across the street. You expect me to believe that? (SWEARS IN ITALIAN) I want that guy dead. I want his family dead. I want his mother dead, because she gave birth to this creep. (COUGHING) (TIRES SCREECHING) Get down! So it was your understanding that Mr. Luca was involved in the importation of... Objection, your Honor. Are we now reduced to talking about third hand knowledge? Mr. Gravenstein, your constant objections are really beginning to annoy me. Now, let's get on with it. Your objection is overruled. Your Honor, don't you think this farce has gone on long enough? It's obvious that Mr. DeSalvo has no knowledge of my client's alleged criminal activities... And... Counsel... Your client is scum, and he already should have been in jail for 20 years. (GENERAL CHATTER) Perhaps this might be the time to move for an end to these proceedings. The Court will take counsel's motion under advisement. (CHEERING) (TIRES SCREECHING) Hey, I'm sorry, Mitchum. You know I was going to testify. Yeah, yeah, I know. Look, if you don't need me anymore, can I go? Take off. I need cab fare. Christ, Frank, you got a lot of balls. Jared, give him the car keys. What? Give him the car keys. Better watch your ass. Kind of looking under the passenger seat. (CAR ENGINE STARTS) MAN ON RADIO: Dangerous driver, late model blazer. License number 1KILLR. Over. Unit 32, out. Dad! If you want him, come and get him. Get him! Get him! Get him, dad! Hey! Argh! (GROANS) Catch! Dad, dad, where's Mom? Mom okay? Is she... Let's go. You did it. (SCREAMING) He's still alive! (GROANING) (SCREAMS) (GROANING) (EXCLAIMS) Don't you do it! I'm still here! In reverse! In reverse! Come on! (SCREAMING) Fuck you! Run the son of a bitch over! Kill him! Where the hell is he? Cut the corner! (SCREAMING) (PRESS CHATTER) Uh, excuse me, sir... Great. A few years of hard work, the bastard's gonna walk. Take it easy, Jerry. Take it easy. You know what... Hey, suckers! Look who's here. Hey, nice try, suckers. Easy, Tom. I know you could never put me away. Hey, I know about you, Mitchum. You're a dead man. How much time you got? Six months? Maybe seven? How the hell are you gonna put me away? Let me tell you something, Mitchum. I'm gonna dance on your fucking grave. I'm gonna piss on it, you bush-legged, coughing fuck. (SCREAMING) I would like to have known your friend Brian. Yeah, he was a good guy. Thanks for coming to the funeral. A trip down memory lane. Maybe I'll even go back into the undertaking business. Legit. You're a character, you know that? (LAUGHS) Sorry about your Uncle Brian. You know, I wish we would have met differently. You stay in touch, huh? I doubt it. Take care of yourself, Mrs. Collins. Are you going to be relocated? I'm doing it myself, this time. You worried at all about Mitchum? No. He's got problems of his own. You know? The guy did what he had to do, and I respect that. Kenny, come on. Frank, get in the front seat. (CAR ENGINE STARTS) Maybe I will settle down. Maybe. Hey.
