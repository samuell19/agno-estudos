Some people... Some people just let it happen. And they do just fine like that. They let it happen and everything works out fine. But others... most, maybe. For them, just letting it happen means they won't be fine. So, if they can, they try to make a move. Make things happen. It has to do with who they are. With how they are. There's a lot more to it, of course. But, well, I guess I gotta go now. Yo, man! Hey, you okay? Come on, Jack, let's go home. I was just playing with them, man. I don't even have it anymore. What are you doing back there? We're just looking for somebody. Hey! They got him! Grab him, man! He's running! Welcome home, Jack. This ain't my home. Sorry, Jack, can't help you there. Calm down, man. Ooh! Calm down, man. Hey, yo! Yo, yo, yo! You got him where you want him, Jack! Come on, get him! Hey, listen, man. You got him where you want him, Jack! Do him like Tyson back in the day, Jack. Bite that ear like a Holyfield sandwich. Bite that god damn ear! Bite that god damn ear, bite that... Hamilton, I need you up, I need you up. Guys? Jack! Wake up! Smitty, what are you doing? Stay back there! I'ma beat 'em and choke 'em... You're choking him. He's trying to say something. Smitty, Smitty. Just let him breathe. Just breathe. You got something to say, say it. You're making me late for work. You need to check that "wrong side of the bed stuff," Jack. It's getting real old around here. That's the second time in a month I've tried to wake you out of some nonsense, and you grab me. Out! And bite me this time? His meds are on the desk. Thank you. Whoo! Nurse Crawford, they had us outnumbered. Just a little screaming in his sleep. And they pile on like Mariano here just closed down game seven. Can you give us a minute, Hamilton? Sure, sure, no problem, I'm hungry anyway. Why don't you take 60? 59, 58... 12.2. All right, I'm out. Mm-mm. Peace. It was just a dream. It's not just a dream when you wake up fighting three staff members. I could increase your Risperdal. I just lost that weight. A larger dosage at night, half a.m., half p.m. There are also a couple of other medications we haven't tried. I'll discuss it with Parker later. I'm leaving on the first. Yeah, we're trying to make that happen, we really are. I have to go. Please? I have to... I told you I had to go. Sorry, Mike. Hey, hey... Hey. You good, Jack, you good? Would you like an apple? No, I don't want an apple. I'm just kind of nervous today... Oh, well, you know what, with your medication... Yeah, I know with my medication... It's really not good for you to have a donut. 'Cause last week we talked about the... Yo, Jack. Sometimes you just don't give us no choice. Hey, guys. I saw you make $300 in one day. You did 20 runs in one day. These are not fake. They're not stolen. My man works in the editing room, the quality is crisp, crisp, crisp, like a apple, crunch. Burns 'em right there, on the low. Come on, $5 for a DVD. This one right here, the action is bananas. Miguel. That's your name, Miguel, right? You haven't seen this one yet. This one didn't even come out. And in Blu-ray? Damn! Get that stuff out of here, Dundee. Yo, this flick, right here? Good flick, B. But put the kids to sleep first 'cause it's got some language and whatnot, you know? Reviews, too. Yo, PG-13 don't mean nothing, Fat. How about just stick to the job I pay you for? The one day you decide to show up. Jack. All right, hold on one second, please. Madison and 39th to 45th and Fifth. 57th between Broadway and Seventh to 53rd between Maddie and Park. 60th and Fifth to 63rd and Lexington. Is that all? We'll see what else comes in. Mm-hmm. He's on his way. Let's go hit these mean streets, kid. Third Street's gotten a lot better out here. You gonna be good there. $5, $5. What, that's not good news? I'm not going. No, don't say that, man. No, no, I'm not going to Third Street. I got an apartment. Really? Yeah, I looked it all up. I'm gonna be joining the club like you. Yeah, yeah. Damn. That's what I'm talking about. What they say about it? I guess you drop it on 'em when you drop it on 'em. That's great news, though, Jack. Come on, that's how we do out here, kid. Keep it up, Jack attack. Attack! Do your thing, baby. Change? Want a bag? That dog was howling! What the hell, man, no "sorry"? Sorry. What, that's it, just "sorry"? That's all I get? Man, how about a hello? What's up? How you been? Man, damn, man. All this time I've been away, have you lost your damn manners, Jack? Bad enough you never came upstate to visit. Man, you know I'm just playing. What you been up to? Nothing. Man, nothing ain't that bad. Looking clean, too. Rocking your little jacket and whatnot, little tie. From work. Yeah? Doing what? Messenger. Hey, that's funny. You know, thinking of getting back in the business again my own self. Might even have something coming up soon. Like old times. That's okay. What's okay? Nothing. But it's okay? I mean, I have to go. Go where? I just... I just have to go. But you sure it's okay? I don't know, Travis. I do. Get the hell out of here, Jack! And the next time you bump into me or anyone else out here, you better show some god damn respect! Thomas. Yep? You were saying? Saying... Oh, yeah, I took the practice test for my driver's license. How'd it go? I-I think I did really good. But really, there were... You know, there were a couple really hard questions, made me really confused, kind of really scared. Really? Well, we talked about this. Fear, nervousness, triggered by new places, new experiences, things like appointments and interviews and tests. Walking, talking. Breathing. How's that for a new situation one can't ever seem to avoid? New breaths, every minute, every day. I once had this job... It was a serious job. Responsibility, lots of stress. And I'd have this thing where... I'm sorry, but what kind of job? I sold things, like, that kind of job. Sold what, to who? "Whom." Like, uh, books or shoes. Anyway, sometimes this thing would happen to my eyes, where my eyes would become sensitive to light, so I wore sunglasses, which worked, but then they stopped working, so I needed to wear two pairs of sunglasses at the same time, which work. The boss said that customers... They thought I was kind of strange. But three pairs worked best. But even I knew that that looked kind of silly. Anyway, I don't have that problem now because I'm not scared of the light. The light's all right, don't fight the light, right? Right. Don't fight the light, the light's all right. Don't fight the light, right... Hamilton, come on. Anyway... this was about my eyes. What is more important than the ability to see? Certainly not your ability to speak. Samuel! Samuel. Well, that nonsense doesn't even make a little bit of sense. He can't say that. No, he doesn't... he cannot say that to you, no. Ginnie. He knows that. Sorry I'm late, everyone. You all know Dr. Parker. Hello. From where? From last week, remember? I introduced you. Then what happened to Dr. Malechy? Hamilton, Dr. Malechy died a year-and-a-half ago. Damn! And Dr. Santos? Santos left last month. He got a new job. Damn! Damn! We were just finishing up. Well, we've still got a few minutes. Ginnie. I think you were speaking. No, I'm done. Anyone else? Melissa? Jack? I'm... I'm-I'm okay. Pretty good, actually. I've got something else to say, speaking of pretty good. Because Jack's gonna be leaving soon, I know how hard you've been trying to focus, to get things right. And it looks like you finally really have. I'm proud of you, that's all. Good luck, Jack. Yeah. Congratulations. Well, I'm leaving soon too, you know. It's what we're all working towards. Thank you, everyone. And remember to do your lists for our trip. Jack. Jack... Jack... You ready? You didn't have much to say tonight. Many think that group therapy and actively participating in it is an important part of recovery. Do you? Let's talk about your folder. I'm still working on it. It's just to get to know you, Jack. Dr. Santos knew me well. But Dr. Santos isn't here anymore. So now I have to approve your release in what... Three weeks? Two weeks. Two weeks, four days. Not much time. Okay. The address change forms just got... I figured it out, it was pretty simple. There's some clinics near my new place, cell phone applications for plans. I'm gonna need... I'm just having a hard time figuring it out, 'cause there's a lot of them, and actually... Plus, they're kind of expensive. There's a big list of everything I need to do with furniture and buying stuff, I'm still deciding on some things, so... We're also just taking our time with things. But, we can't take too much time. Why not? Because I'm running out of time. Why? Because I'm ready to go. Why is that, Jack? I don't understand your question. Well, I admit I haven't read your entire file, but... I used to be pretty messed up, but I'm not now. So honestly, honestly, all I need you to do is to sign, sign the form that says I'm pretty... I'm good to go. Because I am, I'm ready to go. I'm ready to live on my own. I'm... I'm ready. Yeah. That's great to hear, Jack. So why don't you and Nurse Crawford do a psychosocial summary this week? And as for us, I'll schedule our interview for next Friday, 1:00 p.m. That's ten days away. So between now and then, I'll study your reports and you'll stick to the transition plan you're working on. And if all goes well, and there's no surprises, then I suppose I'll be signing you out of here, as you say, all good to go. It was nice speaking to you, Jack. Yeah. Oh, hello. He's got to sign me out. He doesn't have to do anything. I'll just leave. That's a terrific idea. There's not enough city's homeless shelters with ex-patients who just left without the proper paperwork. Getting out of here the right way, with his signature, is no joke, so when Dr. Parker says you stick to the plan... I was gonna tell you. When... When were you gonna tell me? I called Third Street this afternoon, checking up on another consumer. Delores told me you took yourself off the list, and you did it weeks ago. I found an apartment, Denise. A real apartment. Third Street was the plan. But I did better, right? And... now this is the plan, new plan. And I'm not gonna change it. I set it all up on my own, you know. I talked to the super. It's gonna be great. Great. We had this conversation. I know, I know. I'm early. But I was waiting. How you doing, Jack? What's up, Myron? Hey. I'll be right back. Hey, Dad. Hi, John. You excited about the team? Probably not. My friends aren't playing this year. It's pretty much just Dominican kids. What's wrong with that? I won't get to play short. I told Mom you were moving. You know, the apartment, the new apartment, it's pretty nice. You told me. You can come by whenever you want. You told me. I'll make you a key and you come over like it's your own spot. Bring a girl, some drinks, whatever you want. Well, maybe not the drinks. A little while ago, I asked her about what happened before you went away those other times. What she say? That I should ask you. Okay. Even though she told me about one time. What time was that? The time you almost burned our house down while we were all sleeping inside. When you put a stack of newspapers under the sofa at 2:00 in the morning and struck a match. I don't... I don't know what to say. It was a long time ago. Yeah, but there were other times, too. I was, I was sick. I went away to get help... and I'm better now. So that's good. It is. Can we play some games now? That's good! Ohh... Ohh... It's good? Yeah, it's pretty good. Whoo! Happy birthday! Why don't you open it? It's a card, right? Yeah. But what's in it? There's only two. The game's on your actual birthday. Mom's gonna say something. Don't worry about that. Don't worry about it, it's okay, I'll take care of it. It'll be fine. Normally, with a runner on third, you pitch from the stretch. I mean, that split second will kill you if you wind up. But he wound up. And he was off. Left third like a shot. I think I could do it. Sure you could. You're quick. But with none of your friends playing, you might wanna leave that kind of thing up to the Dominican kids, if you know what I'm talking about. Dad? Yeah? Do me a favor. What's that? Don't ever do that again. Okay. Oh, hey. Hey, John. What do you say? Oh. Uh, thanks. Um... I don't want to lose 'em. You... you won't. Okay. I'll see you next month, Jack. Hey, Myron? About those tickets, I got 'em for his birthday. I could only get two. You need to call her. Yeah, yeah, I was going to. You know how she is. I know how she is. Just give her a call, okay? Hey. You're really leaving. Maybe I'll leave here soon, too. We can hang out. We can hang out even if you don't leave soon. Okay. What do you like to do? Well, today, all day... I feel like I'm telling you a secret. I can keep one. All day... I was really close to killing myself. Really close. Do you want to... Do you want to tell somebody else that secret? No. Will you tell me if it happens again? What's going on? Nothing. You can go, Jack. Oh, we-we-we were talking. I'll see you tomorrow, Jack? What happened? Look, what... what happened? Nothing. Listen, Melissa. You have to... Just go, Jack, please. Oh! Jack, there you are, man. I've been looking all over the place for you. You got a call. Where's Smitty? Left. No, no. No, no, no! Hey, I can't... I didn't say to come over here, Jack. Mira, calientame el mangú, eh? I got your message. I-I-I can still move in, like, before, Hector, right? Like we've been talking about? Because you said this was all cool. I told them I was coming here. Because you said... You told me how much it cost and then you said everything was fine. Yeah, and now the company doesn't want to let it go for less than 750 a month, and they want the first and last month rent with the deposit. I'm sorry, Jack. But it was so much less. They put in a new kitchen. What can I do? And I explained it to them, you know, about you, about your mother used to live here. About trying to help you out. But that's much more. I mean, it's like, it's... Yeah, it's $2,250 up front. That's not the plan. I-I gotta stick to the plan. I told them that I was coming, and then that was the plan. And... and, um... Can you still do it? Can you still do it, Jack? Jack! Do you still want the apartment? Yeah. Yeah, it's... See, I have to stick to the plan. It's just the money part that I gotta figure out. The money part's a big part, Jack. It's the whole part. They're gonna make me rent it, so you have to let me know. Soon. It's 22... It's $2,250 up front, then 750 a month. 200... thousand? Yeah, yeah, I'll write it down for you. I'll write it down for you, okay? And seven... Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna write it down for you. Okay, okay, and, and... Firing me for unexplained absences. Just ain't right, man. I had plenty of explanations, damn good ones, too... please. Been over there three years, on and off. You'd think for that kind of loyalty, you would be rewarded or be worth something. All I'm saying is, screw Fat Hop. I asked for more runs. How many you got today? Five. You need to line up some other things. You need to diversify your employment scenario, Jack. It's never worked out well for me working more than one job at a time, no. I thought that's what this was all about, Jack. A new day. Changing it up. Bigger and better. Moving forward, you know? Taking steps. Left, right. Right, left. Give me a minute. Turkey or ham? What? Yo, hold this. Wow, what took you so long? Traffic, ma'am. What's that? Speak up. Traffic. Well, I just hope my ice cream isn't melted. It was last time. Yes, ma'am. Thank you very much, ma'am. Have a nice day. I will if my ice cream isn't melted. You see this shit? The whole world got problems, man. So what you need me to do? Oh. I just need help. Figuring it out. What's to figure? You need to make $900. 899.50 in the next five days, and a whole lot extra every month from now on, or get a cheaper spot, or stay where you are. I'm not staying. Cheaper spot. Well, what about the place you stay? It's nice? What? It's like a castle, bro. But all the apartments are full up. Maybe not the penthouse, but I don't think you could really afford that, bro. You know what? Maybe what you need to do is go to a reality. Or, like, a "really-ator," you know, a rental office. They got mad listings, that's all they do. Hi. How can I help you? I need an apartment. Oh, okay, what exactly are you looking for? Something private for 500 a month, maybe 550. $550? Pretty much anywhere in Brooklyn or Manhattan will be okay. I'm sorry, but there's just not much out there in that price range, so... I gotta take this. Rentals, please hold. Sir, I'm sorry, but there's nothing here for you. Well, you can call me whenever you want. Just after 2:30. Okay, thank you. She works in the coffee shop at my office, and we started talking one morning a couple of weeks ago. But you always get to that point where you don't know how much to tell them. Less is more. I told her a lot anyway. But I wanted to be honest. Plus, you always say that what we have is nothing to be ashamed of. That's right. She seemed okay with it. So the next week, I asked her to a movie, and she said yes. That's great. What did you see? I don't remember the title or the actors' names or anything, but it was a comedy. And it was pretty funny. I mean, I think that I... I think that I laughed at all the right parts and everything. I was feeling pretty together that night. Plus, what you said last week helped a lot, Dr. Parker, so thank you, thank you for that. You're welcome, Charles. So what happened then? We took the subway home. I wanted to bring her back to her house, you know? Be a gentleman. I guess I was kind of quiet on the way back. You know, I was thinking about the movie and how much fun that I had with her. I also... I wanted to ask her out again, you know, so I guess I... What happened? Well, we were on the platform, you know, just waiting for the train. The Q... it was the Q train. Sometimes it takes so long for them to come. And... All of a sudden, she turned to me, with a smile, and she said, "Well, I hope you're not thinking of pushing me onto the tracks." Like I'm... You know, like that's... Charles. Charles? Hmm? I'm sorry. How did you respond? I sm... smiled. Like I thought that the joke was funny. And I know that I should have said something. I should have told her that what she said was wrong, you know, and mean. But I didn't say anything. So, when she got on the train, I got on with her and then... I got right back off right before the doors closed. And I walked home. There's other fish in the sea anyway, right? Plus, it's... I have a question, you could call it. Viveca, let's let Charles finish, okay? I'm done. I knew that. But he wasn't done. But I want to ask it, about the Internet we have going on around here? It's wireless, right? All around us, it's doing what it does, the way that it does with sounds and information and pictures, you get what I'm saying? I want to know what exactly is protecting us from all this stuff. I'm asking. Viveca, it's safe. And I really don't think it's helpful to get into all this again, so... But listen... Let's just move on, okay? Anyone? Jack. That's great. Um, you have something to say? I-I do. Maybe you could just check the Internet again? Excuse me? For her, for Viveca. It seems to be a concern of hers. Maybe you could double-check and let her know that there are absolutely no-no problems. Thank you. There is no problem. Well, I don't know about that, 'cause I keep asking and asking and I'm really not getting the right answer here. Look, I think... I'm sorry, but I'm not. Look, I think this is probably a good time to stop for today. Thank you, everyone. Wait, why are you gonna stop when I have a question? Look, we'll talk privately in my office, you and I. But this concerns everyone! The group's time is up, Viveca. We can talk privately. No, you need to slow down here. Look, we'll talk... And you need to listen to me, Dr. Parker! Stop acting like I'm crazy like the rest of everyone in here, with their meds and no meds and craziness under control, over control, around control, below, within control, complete, uncontrol. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not. Let's go to my office, okay? No! Everyone hears voices. What do yours tell you, hmm? That I'm crazy? Don't listen to yours, okay? Okay. Listen to me. Viveca, just calm down, okay? Listen to me! Okay, we're gonna listen to you. We're gonna listen to you. But we need to listen to you when you're calm, right? Right? Okay. Okay, are you ready? Okay, you're gonna listen to me? Definitely. Are you gonna be calm? Mm-hmm.Okay. That's a deal, that's a deal. Okay. Okay. Here we go. I'm sorry. It's okay, that's all right. It was a serious problem that they hoped to overcome by taking their time and trying to get close to them. But this 70-year-old male, who was so playful just a few days before, is no longer in the mood for fun. He was on a hunt for food, and divers just aren't on the menu. Unlike most sea turtles, adult green turtles are herbivorous, feeding on sea grasses and algae. Juvenile green... You okay today? Can I tell you something? I shouldn't have said that to you. But you did. So you tell me something, maybe we'll be even. You know that apartment I'm supposed to go to? They raised the rent. I can't afford it. Ask Denise what to do? If I don't have any place, I'm not going anyplace, and that can't happen. I know I haven't been here that long, but... I mean, this place... Get away from me! Calm down. It's in the air! It's in the air! No! I told you, I told you! Calm down, calm down! Viveca! Viveca! Why don't you listen to me? I told you, it's what I've been saying! It's what I've been saying! Talk to me, you gotta calm down. It's what I've been saying... Look it up! You have to watch the wireless. You have to watch the wireless, please, please. I shut the wireless off. I told you! The wireless isn't gonna hurt you, just relax. Okay, okay, because you know it's not me. I know, I know. You know that, you know me. Let me get the chair, I know, I know. It's not gonna hurt you, the wireless is not gonna hurt you. It's okay, it's okay. It's not gonna hurt you. Just calm down. No! Viveca! Get away from me! Get away from me! Viveca! Don't let her get outside. Watch your back, coming through. Come on, Leo, this way. This isn't right. It happens. But it didn't have to happen, not this time. Why not? He could have just told her what she wanted to hear, and with her medication... Oh, don't stop because of me. No, no, seriously. Seriously, I want to know. It sounded like you have an opinion as to why Viveca had this break. I don't. Sure you do. You feel she's in that ambulance now because I didn't stroke her head softly and indulge her hallucinations and delusions. I just don't know why you couldn't tell her what she wanted to hear. And that's my point. You don't know. And the next time you want to participate in my group, maybe you could limit your comments to something about yourself, instead of publicly second-guessing my approach to one of the other consumers, because you really don't know, Jack. That part you got absolutely right. What the hell you looking at me for? You need to show some respect, Jack. Dealing with a new doc like that, upsetting him and everything, with you being so close and all? You might want to be a little less all in his face, if you still need him to write that order for you. For what it's worth, most of us are here to help you people, and personally, I don't expect any thanks from anyone, but I also don't expect anyone to wrong me neither. Why was she crying, Smitty? What? Melissa... you were with her the other night. Why was she crying? Good night, Jack. I can tell. Denise. Maybe the police? Because I've seen you. You're always with her, always in her room. I don't know what you're doing with her. Part of me thinks it's cute how you think you're protecting her, and part of me wants to take that delusional, psychotic head of yours... There's medication for that. Funny. You shouldn't be taking advantage of her, and I'm gonna make sure you never do it again. Why was Melissa crying? Because the kitchen ran out of sauce for the spaghetti I brought her. Can you imagine that, Jack? Screaming, hitting the wall, banging her head, throwing things. Crazy, out of control, for spaghetti sauce. You were alone with her. You're always alone. 'Cause I'm her cousin, dumb-ass! The reason she got into this place in the first place is 'cause of me. And it may not be the best, but it sure ain't the worst, despite what you might think. Me, Jack. I got this for her. And with me here, she's gonna be good. What the hell, Jack? You really think I'd be all like that with a god damned mental patient? Some advice, Jack. You may want to worry about yourself. How's the apartment hunt going, anyway? What, Jack? You know everyone hears things around here. Ready? So we do this now and on interview day, Dr. Parker will ask you couple of questions. You will impress him with your lucid state of thinking and your overwhelming sanity, and that should be that. Until today? Family history, educational background, past and present psychiatric diagnosis, present medications, employment history. Favorite TV show for bonus points. "Jeopardy". No, "Sports Center". And I need to look at your lease and visit your residence. Okay. How is that going? Fine. You can give it to me now, if you want, the lease. You can get it out of the way. It's in my locker at work. Don't forget. The other day, my son asked me about what happened to me before. How old is he now? 12, 12. There are a lot of things I don't remember, big parts of what I did. You've never really been interested in this before. Well, he's never asked me before. And if-if remembering things could help explain and being honest could help explain, then maybe, I... Jack, I know we have to dig up a lot of stuff here, but really, you need to concentrate on where you are now and more importantly, where you're going. You need to be back there working for Fat. Four runs today... four! Yeah, well... These guys here might be hiring for the night shift. It still won't get me what I need. Yeah, you're probably right. I mean, even if you added up this job with your regular job, a couple temp jobs, let's say DVD money, recycled can money, squeegee money, bent Metrocard money, fake cripple in a wheelchair in a subway money, although... Nah, you still ain't getting it all in a week. I ran into Travis the other day. Right, right. Now it's all making sense. I-I just need to do it once. Until next month. Just once. And you're sure there's no other way? Son. I think you've always been fine with that. Asking for things. What I don't understand is this... sudden need to leave. You've never been there. Well, I know that they take care of you. I mean, you live there with others like you, and there's a staff that cooks you food and helps you with your laundry and brushes your teeth. I mean, whatever you need, right? I brush my own teeth. I know. You come here after all this time. Because you told me never to come back. Yet... Four years ago. Here you are. What do you want, Jack? A loan. A-ha, hmm... So from what you've said, you need about what? A thousand? I only need 900, I have the rest. So if I were to write a check for 2500, that would give you at least enough for two months, plus a little extra in case of an emergency? That's right. So that'd be good, right? Are you kidding? That would be great. Well, I'm not gonna do that. Because you need to learn that there are some things that you are responsible for, that if you have an apartment that you can't afford, then you have to get another apartment. I'm sticking to my plan. Fuck a plan, Jack. You need to be realistic. I'll go now. Just like your mother. There were just some things she had a hard time looking at realistically. Are you talking about me? Realistically? Forget it. How she cared for me? Didn't give up on me? Is that what you're talking about? I said forget it. Making those bad doctors treat me. The government paid for me, and when that didn't work, take two jobs to put me in a clinic? Calm down, Jack. I am calm! Maybe you're talking about how she didn't give up on herself when she got sick 'til when she died, without so much as a "get well" card from you or a bunch flowers during that whole time. Is that what you're talking about? Dad? We had our problems. You did. We did, we did. She chose her path just like you're doing. I don't know about paths. Or how much choice we get. All I know is that I came here to ask you something I thought would be easy for you. Hey, yo, Hamilton. What's up, Jack? You ever think about when you might leave? Yeah, you know, they tried to get me out of here a while back, but nah. I think I need to stay here a while longer, you know. Soak up some more of this wonderfully therapeutic environment... unh! You know, sometimes when it's just me and you, it doesn't seem like you're so bad. It actually almost seems like you're trying to be... What the hell you know about me, Jack? I'm one crazy bastard, man. Boogity, boogity. You know what? You're just as crazy as I am, Jack. I mean, come on. You the one giving up three squares and a nice, warm bed. Friends, company, a roof over your head. And that's all it should be? That's what I'm supposed to want? What else is there? Oh, right. Your own place. That's so great, that's terrific. Congratulations. Well, now you gotta deal with the shopping and the chores and the rent and the bills and the government people trying to give you less now, trying to make you work now 'cause you all able. You're not so crazy now. Then of course, there's the people living next door to you. They don't know you. That don't stop them from staring at you, talking about you. Telling their kids to watch out for you when you... when you're just out for a little walk. It's not... it's not gonna be like that. And that's good, Jack. I'm glad it's all gonna go your way. So then to answer your question, nah. I don't spend time thinking about when I might wanna leave. Could be nicer around here, sure. Food could be better. Women could be hotter. But even with all that... Nah. 'Cause when I look around, all I see is a happy home. A crazy, happy home. You are still leaving, right? Yeah, I'm still leaving. Good. 'Cause I'm talking your side of the room. There's more Feng Shui over there. I'll see you guys later. Hey, where are you going? Huh? You forgot. No, I didn't. Forgot what? Our trip. Ready for the world, baby, ready for the world. Where you at, Jack, where you at? Hamilton. Let's go, let's go. Don't go too far ahead, come on. Okay, let me... Let me say this again, one more time for you, okay? You have your lists, yes? Everything's written down on the lists. The aisles are marked so you do not need to get sidetracked. Everybody ready? Yeah... Have fun. ♪ Me ♪ Running around ♪ Catching my train ♪ Finding my way ♪ You ♪ Taking the bus ♪ Carrying your bag ♪ ♪ Finding your way ♪ You ♪ In my dreams and in my heart ♪ ♪ Me ♪ Driving home ♪ Finding my way ♪ Finding my way, hey ♪ My credit is spotless. Max? Yeah? It's not the busboy's fault if the food doesn't come out cooked right, okay? But that's... No, no, no, you need to ask nicely, all right? Thank you. Excuse me. I'd like some more cream, please. Sondra, you see what happens, right? We talked about that, right? Don't touch that. What kind is it? It's pink. I said don't touch it. Buddy, I've already had a hard day. You don't have to have that tone in here, especially not with her. I need people to stop acting so wild in here. All she said was she likes your cake. Where's Pauly? He's not here today. All right, once a month we never had a problem. Is today gonna be different? I don't know. Look, if you want to be sure, just come back when he's here. Okay, all right. I think we're gonna go somewhere else. What? We're gonna... Yeah, yeah. Where we gonna... We're gonna go somewhere new. Hey, man. What? Apologize to her. I heard you, you can't go around... Samuel. Talking about people like that. You can't just go around calling people names like that. Hey, I didn't call anybody a name. Samuel, calm... No, I heard him. He called Ginnie a name. Okay, Samuel. You know what? No, okay, no. Listen, listen, listen, no. All of you get out. Hey, you have got some nerve. I have nerve? You bring this group in here, ordering ridiculous things, this one with the cake, that one hasn't bathed in a week and smells up the whole restaurant, and this one over here waved a knife at one of my waiters. What... I have nerve? You have nerve. Take it easy, man. Apologize to her, too. It's cool. Just leave, just leave. I'm not gonna leave just 'cause you tell me to. Out, out! Samuel! This is why we can't go anywhere. This is why we can't go anywhere. No! No! Out, out, out! The people united! We'll never be defeated! Hamilton! Hamilton... Samuel. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Did they call the police? No. Samuel, Samuel. I am sorry. Samuel, what I was going to say was it was good of you to stick up for Ginnie like that. Hey, Ginnie, um... I was gonna wait 'til later, but I got you something. I don't want nothing, Jack, I just want to go home. I don't even know how this got in here. I don't... Oh, Jack. You know, that stunt could have gotten you in a lot of trouble. More than trashing a diner? Pauly's gonna kill me. It was pretty good. Jack! I'm not even gonna ask why I never heard anything about this. I was gonna call you. For him and Myron, right? Well, it's a straight shot on the 4 right to my new place. Your new place? You should have gotten three. They... they were expensive. I didn't tell you to buy 'em. I gotta go to work. He doesn't like 'em? That's not the point, Jack. They are really okay with this? I mean, everyone is really okay with you finding your own place, spending on apartments and ballgames and whatever else? But we've been here before, right? The feeling better, the wanting to be a good dad. Telling people what you think they want to hear instead of the truth. That's not right. We've known each other forever. I know you... maybe better than anyone, and I know you mean well. But you're sick with something that will never go completely away. We gotta be realistic about that. We are realistic. Yeah. I can live a normal life. I've recovered, I'm better. Are you really? 'Cause you need to know if all this should suddenly fall apart the way it has in the past, if the job should disappear, if the apartment goes away, if you go away... I'm not going anywhere. He needs me, as his father. As his father, you need to do what's right for him. You're not dragging us down with you again, you're not doing that to our son. No, no, I won't. I know you won't, 'cause I won't let you. No way in hell. What about these? You should have gotten three. Jack! Jack, just calm down. No, no! How long has he been doing this? 10 minutes. And it's bigger than yours! And he's not gonna help me use it! We need you to calm down. What? No, no, no, stop, stop, stop! They're gonna shoot you! Let's get you to the hospital. Sir, sir? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Do you know that you're in the hospital? Do you know you're in the hospital? Do you know where you are right now? You're in the hospital. Do you remember anything from yesterday? I was here yesterday, I was here... Today, today, today, today, today! Today, today, today, today! Today, today, today, today, today! Today, today, today, today, today! You can't just show up like this. I just wanted to talk for a minute. I can't talk now, I gotta get him to camp. But not you. No, we gotta go. But he asked me... About what? About what happened before. No. No. When someone is sick, as sick as I was, sometimes you do things you don't know you're doing, or you forget. And I forgot a lot of things. And when you were five, it was kind of when everything changed for us. See, we went to the zoo... What made you think this was a good idea? I thought that... You thought? So all the sudden, you just decide to show up here and we're supposed to stand here and listen to you? Just... forget I asked. It's not right, Jack. This is exactly what I'm talking about. It's not helpful. Now, let's go. Two minutes. Maybe your mom's right. At the zoo, when I was five. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Well, we had a great day. They closed and we left and we got on the bus to go home, and everything was good. Really good. And then, I got up and I left you. Where? On the bus, John, I left you on the bus. You forgot me? No. I... I did it on purpose. I don't understand. I had a reason. You were so much fun and so happy. And I loved you so much. And I thought in my head, I thought, that I wanted everybody to know that feeling. I was five. But the bus driver took you, and your mom, she picked you up. So everything ended up, you know, okay. But something like that won't happen again, right? Because you're better. I am, I am, I am better. Much, much better. But... What? I think... I think you're telling me this now to give yourself a way out. To make it seem like you're really bad, like you're not ready, because maybe all of this about getting your own apartment isn't really gonna happen. No, no, it's gonna happen, John. Man, I'm being straight with you. I have to go. John, it's going to happen, and you can come over, I'll give you a key and you can come over whenever you want. I know! You told me. I took the test yesterday. How did it go? I wrote all the answers down. I drove the guy around the block a few times. I felt pretty good, you know? Normal. What did your brother say? Uh, he wasn't there. Who did you go with? I went by myself. Oh, man. You should have told me you were going on your own. Sorry. So I was thinking about something today. What's that, Samuel? Don't take this the wrong way, Jack, but you ain't ever gonna really get out of here. Nobody cares about what you have to say. But you should care. 'Cause you got a long way to go, and you know that. Well, we are here, we're all here because we've already come a long way. And the next step... Is down the hall to bingo night. Or to a workshop to learn how to wash your clothes. Or a supermarket field trip to shop for a few cans of soup might be on sale. Hand them to Oscar in the kitchen to warm 'em up for you, like you really did something. Congratulations! Soup's on. Please. Someone else. I'm not done. You are done. I'm not. There's an illness running around in here. It's like cancer. It's like diabetes. It might be in remission for a bit, but don't unpack too much, 'cause it'll be back. And you will be back. And we'll all still be here, waiting, with soup for dinner. We need to move on. Well, then, move on then. Take that next step, and another and another. And then what? Huh? You tell me. Then what? I don't know. No, I said, tell me. And I said, I don't know. But you still gotta take 'em, Samuel. The steps, I mean... You still gotta try, don't you? All I'm trying to say, Jack, is... Good luck. 'Cause you're gonna need it. That was not very nice, Samuel. You got it or not, Fat? My father always tries to do right by you people. You know that, Jack. As much as I tell him, it always ends up... From a couple years back. That's all I got. Thanks. Oh, he's a friend of mine. He said that he would hook me up with a place to stay. We're filled up. No, no, not... not here. Not here. He has an apartment. I'm just looking for an address, maybe he left one? Dundee... Calvin. Okay. You have an address? You're there. I don't... I don't understand. He's been living here now about four months. He's been in and out for a few years. This is his address? This is his home? Bed number 173 in the back. I need a job. Get out of here, Jack. I need a job. You're repeating yourself. I've always done good for you. That's true. Never late, like a Swatch. I need money. Man, please. Please! All right, I'll give you a shot. 6:00, Lefferts Avenue. Move, man! ♪ ...and now I'm overdosed, in a permanent over-sleep ♪ The unnamed man, also known as the Hawthorne patient, said his doctors had told him he was cured of the virus.

Of course, they only wanted to talk to me. That's a cop for you. Always there when you don't need him. Listen to me, man, listen to me... Listen to me! Think about it. He was crazy, and he had a place to live. You're not that crazy, and you don't. How fair is that? Where's your medication? Somebody took it. 'Cause it's yummy. But I don't need it.

I'm trying to move up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and at 'em. You know how it is, Jack. Yeah, you know that. Okay, okay. I know you know that. Hey... You gonna be okay? Yo... yo, I thought you had to go in. I got stuff to do, I gotta go to work. Okay, yo, I'm gonna check back here for you, all right? All right? Yo, Jack. Oh, Parker needs to push your meeting to 3:00. I guess golf's running late today. Golf? Really? No, man, sorry. Just a joke, but your meeting is at 3:00. What? It's just... When... Did they give my bed away yet? What do you mean? On the first, when I leave, how soon do they fill the beds? Why are you asking me that, Jack? Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm good, I'm good. You know, I got a place, it's... It's hard. Yes, it's hard. Yeah. Life, man. But it's what you want, right? Yeah... yeah. Good, 'cause you know, I was here when you first got here. Like, way back, you remember? Yea... No. Well, let's just say you can't give up, okay? Not you. Come in. Thought you'd be all packed up by now. Anyway, a guy named Hector on the phone. You wanna take it? Listen, my wife's cousin, she runs this building. She might have something for you. Yeah. 362 Wenley. You gotta go there fast. Yeah. Ask for Esmin. Esmin! And listen... Good luck. 625, electric, phone and cable separate. But I know a guy can get you 700 channels for 50 bucks and two bottles of Puerto Rican rum. But only the good stuff, don't be cheap. I'd like to rent it. Well, I have to ask. Are you gonna be a problem? Hector mentioned some things. I've had some problems in the past, but I haven't been a problem in a long time, so I definitely don't plan on being a problem. That's right, we just cleared everybody, the station's closed. What do you mean it's closed? I mean it's closed. How am I supposed to get to Manhattan? Excuse me! Excuse me, can I just go in real quick, just to get the train. The station is closed. So I got the letter today. I got the results back from my driver's test. And? And, maybe I should have gone with someone... There's something I had to take care of, something which I did, I did. And then the trains weren't running. I wasn't supposed to hit the curb and he was judging me, he was writing things down. Just give him some time, okay? No. And then we can talk. No, I don't have time, no. Jack... But I got it. Yeah, boy! You got us, man. Good acting, yo. Congratulations, Thomas. Thanks, Jack. All right, everybody. Thank you. Let's move on. Who'd like to speak next? Even though I know Thomas is a tough act to follow. Doctor, Doctor Parker? You can have a seat, Jack. I know I'm late, I'm sorry. Something came up and I had to take care of it. Okay, we can talk about that later. After group? Uh, I have to leave right after group. I'm here again Friday after next. Dr. Parker. The irony of this is, is that Nurse Crawford did a terrific job putting everything together. The meeting wouldn't have taken long at all. I really only had a couple of questions, but you missed your time. But if it's not gonna take a long time, maybe we could start after group. Well, I said I'm leaving right after. And yes, I do think group is an important part of recovery. You asked me that once. Which is why I'm not gonna take another moment away from it just because you're ready to talk now, after getting here almost an hour late, Jack. You missed your time. Now it's their time. And that's that. All right. Who wants to go next? Anyone? Melissa? Ginnie? I know you wanted to speak earlier. Sherman? No, it's Samuel. Samuel? Charles? Max? Max? Doctor, look. Oh, Leo. Jack's hand's up. So it is. I know I don't usually talk much in group. Of course, I don't know what you're gonna ask during our meeting. So I guess... Jack, you don't have to do this now. You can do this properly later. No. I have to do it now. You know, the other day, Samuel was talking about getting out of here. And working hard has a lot to do with it... yeah. You know, making good choices. But luck does, too. You know, not to be so sick to begin with. To have people around you who wanna help. And lately, when I dream that dream that I always dream about, about having a key to my own front door, and my son coming over to stay. Friends visiting, a girlfriend, maybe. It doesn't seem so impossible anymore. My son is 12, Dr. Parker. You never met him, but he's great. And the other day he asked me about what happened before... The bad stuff... and if that could happen again. I couldn't promise him that it wouldn't. Because if there's one thing we've all learned here, it's that there are gonna be rough days. But what I should have said, what I can promise is that even on those rough days, I am going to live my life the best way I know how. Staying clean, working hard to be the best friend, the best father that I can be to him or to anyone, no matter what they ask of me. Because I mean, now, I don't know how not to be. So... so if you don't sign me out, I'll just keep trying. No, no... I'm going to try harder. More. I'm going to try more. Is that it? So, who would like to speak next? So, he just left. I didn't know what to say. I didn't do good. It was a tough position to be in. I should have said something else. What's that? Thank you... to you. No one ever does. Thank you. I'm not... I'm not gonna give up. I'll just try harder, and I'll try more and I'll make sure I... There is no reason to, Jack. He's letting you go, he signed you out. Wow. Okay? See you around. Not here you won't. Don't even think about coming back. Next time I won't be so nice. Yo! I can give that bed away now? I got dibs, man, I told you that. What is it? Check your rear view mirror? Yeah, check that. We ain't got all day, man. I'm sorry. Just take your time. You don't have to listen to Hamilton. I just need to make sure I got everything. I got enough time, okay? All right. Ready? Good. Ready? Come on, start it up, kid! Watch out for traffic, okay? Go, Thomas! Bye, Jack. Go! Go, go, go! Everybody stop... That's my buddy! Bye, Jack! Drive safe! Hey, watch that light.
