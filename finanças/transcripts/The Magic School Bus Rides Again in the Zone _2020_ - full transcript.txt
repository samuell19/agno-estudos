Thanks for inviting us on to Maven's New Year's Eve tour. This is awesome! Well, I couldn't resist when I found out you were all such big fans. How's your end of year thank you video going, Jyoti? Fantastic! I'm getting a lot of great footage! Look! This is my video, to thank the bus for all the amazing things we've done. Who's ready to see Maven in concert? I am excited, but I'm just too tired to raise my arms. Why did we have to leave so early? It's six in the morning, but the concert isn't until 11 at night. How long does it take to get to New Zealand? Ralphie, the concert starts at 11:00 p.m. New Zealand time which is in about an hour. We're going to have to teleport there instantly if we want to make it on time. Here we go! And... we're here! 10:59 p.m. Perfect! Just in time. I don't get it. Did we time travel? No, we time zone traveled. So... we time traveled. -No. -But it's night. How can two places be different times at the same time? Ralphie, you know how it's six in the morning back home, but it's already noon in Italy? That's because of time zones. Walkerville, Italy, and New Zealand are all in different time zones. So that's why Nonna Tennelli always calls so early. I just thought she hated sleep! We're going to hit a midnight concert in every time zone and when we get back to Walkerville, we can ring in the new year with my film! I can't wait to thank the bus for taking us on the best field trips ever! All right, we're in Auckland, New Zealand now and it's almost midnight. Next we need to be in Sydney, Australia for their 11:00 p.m. concert, then Tokyo, Japan at 11:00 p.m., then Beijing, China at 11:00 p.m. I still don't get it. How can we be at all these concerts at the same time? Let me explain it to you. But we need to keep on schedule. Well, then I can explain it to you... on the bus! All aboard, class! What? Of course there's a disco ball on the bus.

It's Ms. Frizzle's class! I know all of you! Keesha, Arnold, Ralphie, Carlos, DA, Wanda, Tim, and Jyoti. Oh, my gosh! She knows our names! Hey, Liz! Oh, bus. I love you too. So, everybody-- -Whoa, did I hit a button? -No, I don't think so. Bus? Well, that was kind of weird, even for the bus. -I'm sure it's fine. -Ms. Frizzle? We have to leave now if we want to make it to the next concert. Well, then... seat belts everybody! Bus, do your stuff! Whoa! Look at that! How's our time, Jyoti? 10:59. We're on Sydney time now. Oh, my heart. -What was that? -Turbulence? -Shouldn't be. -Not to worry. That just means we're going to shake it up in Sydney. Thank you Sydney, Australia!

Ah, so good to be here in Beijing, China! And I'm just in time for my sound check. You guys must be tired of waiting in the wings. Hey, why don't you come right on stage where the action is? - Yes! Please! - We'd love to! I figured you'd want to be close to the band, so I've got your stage passes right here! In my hand. But, where are they? Oh, they're invisible. This show's going to be out of sight. And so will you. Ooh, I like the way you think, cuz! See you on stage! Or not! The bus and I have been wanting a good excuse to try our new NoCanSee-alyzer. Who wants to be invisible? Huh, did I hit the wrong button? Let's try that again. That's better. All right, I'm gonna to need you to stand closer together so I can get you all at once. Erm... I'm having second thoughts. OK, ready, everyone? Line up! Wait! I want to get this on the video! Oh... er... just a sec! I gotta get my phone! Erm, Ms. Frizzle? Er, guys? Whoa! Weird! I'm not entirely sure I like this. Whoa! They really are invisible! Hey, Arnold. If you can hear me say-- That'll do. Come on! I'll race you! Hey, guys! Wait for me! Can you turn me invisible too? OK, give me a sec. Ha-ha. Bus, is this your idea of a yolk? Cos no-one's laughing. Er, Ms. Frizzle, what just happened? I don't know. Bus? Yeah, but that won't happen till we get home. We get home at 11:00 p.m. But it's only 10:00 a.m. back home. It's 11:00 p.m... Oh. And it's been 11:00 p.m. everywhere we've been for the last four hours. Oh, bus! You must feel awful! What's going on, Ms. Frizzle? You see, every year at precisely midnight on New Year's Eve, the bus updates its Magicware. -Its what? -No, it's "ware". Magicware. You know, the programs that make the bus do its magic stuff. Cos it's a magic bus. OK, but, it's not midnight yet. I know. Here's the exciting part. The bus starts downloading the new Magicware at 11. It's a really big file. Thirteen giga-buses. I thought we would be home by 11 our time to do the download and update, but the bus has been downloading the file at 11 o'clock in every time zone we've been in. And since we keep leaving before midnight, it can't install the update. Aww, but, what do eggs have to do with it? Well, with all those files downloading, the bus is glitching. Could it turn us into eggs again? Eggs, footstools, iron filings. Who knows? I don't know, you don't know, the bus certainly doesn't know. But, if it's just an update, Ms. Frizzle, what's the problem? Though, it is worth noting that once the bus installs the new Magicware at midnight, any old magic that's still active could never be undone. Wait a minute, does that mean if they're invisible at midnight, they'll be invisible forever? Yes! So good thing they're not! Oh, wait, we totally made them invisible, didn't we? Huh. But ta-da! We can turn them back with this! Not what that was supposed to do, but hang on! Emergency! No time! I'll go get the class back! And I'll figure out how to get us back to Walkerville! Let's see what the Reconstituter does now, huh? Ready? Uh-oh. Woo-hoo! Gotta find the class. Gotta get us home! Otherwise we'll spend the rest of our lives as moth children!

But watch out for Liz, she's not herself. Will someone please tell us what's going on? The bus is downloading its new Magicware and that means it's not responding in the usual way. It needs to undo any old magic before updating. So... if it doesn't turn you back to normal by midnight, - you'll be moths forever. - Forever?! It's almost midnight! We're running out of time! -Oh no! -Never fear! I have a solution! I just need to figure out which one of these doohickies is the back-up un-mothilizer. So, yeah, let's try this. - Still moths? - Yes! How about this? Er, still feeling a craving for rotten fruit? -Yes! -Oh... this one. -Thank goodness. -Glad that's over. -Woo-hoo! -Whooo! That didn't take long! Now, who's all set to hit another show? We can't! We have to get back to Walkerville. -So soon? -Magicware glitches. -Magic what? -No, magicware! Oh. Sorry to interrupt, but Carlos will be stuck as a snake! -What are we going to do? -Teleport back to Walkerville. Now! Here we go! Oh, OK. The bus doesn't want to teleport because it's not certain where we would end up. With all these glitches it's best to play it safe. -Finally! -Idea! Time zones! - Time zones?! - Yes! Ms. Frizzle, didn't you say the bus won't actually install the Magicware update until exactly midnight? -And I did. -If we go to a different zone, where it's not midnight yet, it won't update, right? Oh, good thinking, Jyoti! All we need to do is keep flying west. That's right! Time zones get earlier the further you fly in that direction. Wait, wait. So if you keep going west and it keeps getting earlier, do you end up in yesterday? Don't be silly, Ralphie. You end up in tomorrow. I can't tell if she's kidding or not. Poor bus. It sounds so uncomfortable. And so does Keesha. When can we turn me and Keesha back into ourselves? - I can't lie, I'm rattled. - Carlos! Do I have something on my face? Don't worry, I'll just wipe it off with my tail. -Oh. -Setback! Ten minutes and 14 seconds till midnight, Ms. Frizzle! Go west to the next time zone! Please! Bus, do your stuff! Maybe, different stuff? There you go! Here we-- Seatbelts everybody! Bus, give me all you got! It's three minutes to midnight! How are we not in a different time zone yet? -But we've traveled so far! -Yeah. Aren't time zones only 1000 miles apart? 1609km, to be precise. But not in China! According to my research, all of China is one time zone, no matter where you go. And Beijing is on the east side! You mean we won't hit another time zone until we reach another country? China is the fourth largest country in the world! The government wanted the whole country on the same time. But eight at night could be dark in one place and still sunny in another? So people can just decide what the time zones will be? Could I make my zone permanent lunch time? No time for jokes. It's almost midnight! In two minutes and 37 seconds, Carlos will be a snake, Keesha will be a baby, and Maven will be a monkey, forever! A rhesus macaque, to be exact. We'll head south to the country of Bhutan. They don't use the same time zone as China, so it's two hours earlier there. Hurry! Ten o'clock! We crossed into Bhutan's time zone! Midnight averted! Erm, let's never speak of this again. Now that we're all back to normal, can we please start the update before anything else happens? OK, let me just find a place to set down. Well, now, this is exciting! I can't land the bus. I knew I should've stayed home today! Hey, it's not all bad. At last I look as old as I feel. Wooh-- We're almost to India! That's the next time zone. That'll buy us another hour to try to turn Arnold back, right? No, I wish. India is only 30 minutes behind Bhutan. Well, what's the next time zone? That's Nepal, but that won't do us much good. -Nepal is 15 minutes ahead. -What?! -You mean we LOSE 15 minutes?! -Yes, but don't worry. After that the next time zone we're in is India, so we gain those 15 minutes back. None of this makes any sense! Oh, you're not wrong, Ralphie. As DA so wisely stated, time zones are arbitrary. Countries and governments just make 'em up. -Oh, no. -And if anyone's got any ideas about how to get out of this, Wanda's all ears. - Carlos! - Sorry. That joke was corny. - CARLOS! - It'll be OK.

I think I can hotwire the bus for a last rocket-powered jump. Hit it, Liz! Bus, do your stuff! Any time now! Bus! OK, class, nav computer set to Walkerville. We're on our way home. At last! Huh. That's new. Ms. Frizzle, what's going on? Well, instead of going to Walkerville, the bus has decided to go its own way and I can't help but feel a little proud. -Where's it going? -Er... it's going south. I thought this whole trip went south a long time ago. -But Walkerville is west! -How south are we going? Oh, about as south as you can get. -South Pole, here we come! -Oooh! Antarctica is one continent I've never played on! -Seriously?! -What? A crisis is the best time to cross things off a bucket list. Is everyone strapped in? - Yes! - Tightly! You bet! Is everyone-- ...O... K? This is not good. -Oh, no! -Er, guys? Please be something cool. Please be something cool... -Aww! -Oh no, no, no! Weird. -Oh. -Why did the bus go south? Not that I'm complaining. It could be our new home! Well, I don't know. Bus? - What did it say? - It said... Three minutes and 58 seconds to midnight! No way we can get to the next time zone. -They're 1000 miles apart! -That's at the equator. We're nowhere near there. Time zones roughly follow the longitude lines on Earth which go from pole to pole. And the Earth is wider in the middle, so at the equator, around the middle part of the globe... Those lines are far apart. But... here... Keesha's right! Here at the pole, the lines all come together. Those of us who can could literally push the bus. -From time zone to time zone! -Follow me! We need to see where the time zones are! It's so close! Just... a little bit further! Come on, come on, come on, come on! We can't give up! Keep pushing! Arnold? Is that...? No! It's... it's... Captain Rock Man! -Captain Rock Man! -Captain Rock Man for the win! Marvel at the might of the man-mountain-made hero who stands before you! -Rock Man rocks! -You're the Rock Man! -All right, Captain Rock Man! -Strong, wise, and ancient as the very earth beneath your feet.

Time to rock and roll this bus into the next time zone! We're gonna make it! Yes! Almost there! Go, Captain Igneous Rock Man! You did it! Why stop at 11? I'll take us all the way to 7:00 p.m.! -Aww. -We can't keep pushing the bus! -It's too cold! -And too heavy. Particularly for a butterfly. Is it just me or is the bus trying to move? Looks like it's heading directly for the South Pole. Why? Hypothesis! If it gets to the South Pole, where all the time zones meet, won't it be in all the time zones at once? Midnight and NOT midnight at the same time! Maybe that's a good thing! Or not. Bus, I hope you know what you're doing. The bus saved us! Wait! Who's going to save the bus? Look! I've certainly never seen this before. Ms. Frizzle? Bus? Bus? Can you hear me? Is the bus... is it... It's gonna be alright, right? I'm not so sure. Are we... stranded?

No, Keesha, it didn't. We got here after midnight. So it froze. What does that mean? No Magicware update means no more magic. Isn't there anything we can do? From now on, the Magic School Bus will just be a school bus. Devastating. -What's that, Jyoti? -It's my film.

The bus updates at midnight, right? But it's already past midnight in this time zone. Yes, but remember how we said time zones are arbitrary? They're based on the needs of the place that set them up? You mean like the sun is directly opposite the place where it's midnight, but it can't be opposite ALL of the places in the time zone at the same time, so "midnight" is really an average? I get it now! Walkerville is at the western end of our time zone. Which means we aren't directly opposite the sun yet. So, if I can reset the bus's clock to base it on the actual position of the sun instead of the time zone time, it won't be midnight in this exact spot for a few minutes. I have a clock on my phone that tells me the true solar time based on my exact location from moment to moment. -Of course you do. -This says true solar midnight for us right here where we are won't happen for another... ...one minute and 42 seconds! I need to sync the bus's clock to the true sun time clock. No, no, no, no, no! Look out! Watch out! Whoa, phone ruined. It doesn't matter, as long as it worked. Time reset! Will the bus be able to upgrade now? There's only one way to find out. To the street! What are you doing, Tim? Just syncing my watch to sun time for the countdown. Everyone ready? Ten! Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! - Come on! - Yeah! Here we come! So Ms. Frizzle, if time zones are all arbitrary and made up, then that's not really science. Well, Ralphie, it's the holidays, so this wasn't really a field trip. Happy new year! Let's try that one more time. And a one, and a two, and a-- Magic School Bus! Maven at your service. Ask me a question and don't be nervous! Wow! I can't believe I'm talking to the Maven! There's a question I've always wanted to ask. How did everyone decide to use time zones? Good one! And I think the best way to answer it is with a song! Liz? Bus? ♪ When people tried to travel way back in the day ♪ ♪ No one knew what time it was in places far away ♪ ♪ Some were late to catch their trains ♪ ♪ And others came too soon ♪ ♪ Cos every town and country had their very own high noon ♪ ♪ They needed time zones ♪ ♪ Made to fit the places where you're bound ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah Cos the time zones ♪ ♪ Standardize what the time is all around ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh♪ ♪ Some people came together in 1886 ♪ ♪ Our time-keepin' system needed a big fix ♪ ♪ They used the lines of longitude ♪ ♪ To slice the world like cake ♪ ♪ Each slice became a different zone ♪ ♪ With uniform daybreak ♪ ♪ They needed time zones ♪ ♪ Made to fit the places where you're bound ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah Cos the time zones ♪ ♪ Standardize what the time is all around ♪ Wow! That was great! I think that question deserves an encore! OK, then here it comes! Is it true that Antarctica has every time zone and that you can walk between them like Ms. Frizzle's class? Well, sort of, but not really. All those time zones would get confusing for the scientists who work in Antarctica, so they usually just pick one time and stick with it. Which reminds me of another song. Hit it, Liz! ♪ Antarctica has research stations ♪ ♪ Made to study science ♪ ♪ From many different countries ♪ ♪ It's a scientist alliance ♪ ♪ Some stations choose the time zone ♪ ♪ That matches their home nation ♪ ♪ Others simply choose ♪ ♪ The one that's closest to their station ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah ♪ ♪ The Amundsen-Scott research station's ♪ ♪ As south as you can walk Ooh, ooh, eh ♪ ♪ New Zealand's is the time zone ♪ ♪ Where they've synchronized their... clock ♪ So, once again, people use the time zone that works best for them. - Right! - Thanks, Maven and Liz!
