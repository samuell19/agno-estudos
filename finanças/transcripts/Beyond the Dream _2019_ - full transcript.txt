So it was with you Thank you Don't just say 'hey' next time Call me Yan-yan I'm Lee Chi-lok C for Chi and L for Lok Bye Go away! I don't want to see you! I told you to go away! My dad always gets crazy after drinking Do you drink? I can't drink Please don't drink Do you live with your mom? Yes She passed away last month Did she love you? She said no one will love me like she did Do your students like you? I'm sure some girls have a crush on you They are just primary students Do you have a girlfriend? No I never had one You're a nice guy, how come you don't? Of course you must tell her If you choose to be with her Why would you lie to her? That's not fair to her One night, I told her that "I once had schizophrenia, but I've recovered" She laughed and called me silly She said I should've told her earlier But then... She began to distant herself And never picked up my calls People like us... Don't deserve to date We're talking about getting married You finally told him? I won't tell him If I have a relapse one day And he doesn't want me Then so be it "Yan-yan" Ling? My husband wants to divorce me Take it easy, sit down first He said everyone saw his wife naked He's embarrassed It was the ghost It said it'd kill my morn It's not your fault It's him who doesn't understand us Why are you so scared? Hiding something from me? No I'll call you tonight I have something to tell you I'll head home first Mr. Lee What is it? I'll break your arm I won't let you see him again He's crazy! Who knows when he'll stab someone? I told you not to be with him He's crazy Why do you have to choose a crazy guy? Do you want more beating? I told you not to be with him Don't go down! Open the door! Y an-yam! Open the door! Open the door, Yan-yan! Call the cops! Call... call the cops! Let Yan-yan go, it has nothing to do with her What time is it?

No... with Joe Lok, let's have a word Give it some thoughts Let me know if you have any questions Have I met you before? Were you the one who helped Ling that day? You told those people off with me Are you all right? Shall we go back to the centre? No, thanks Erotomania ls one of the symptoms derived from schizophrenia The patients fall in love with an imaginary person Or think they have a secret admirer The object of obsession could be an idol, a celebrity or their boss There was once a case where... Two female patients in the same hospital claimed to be... Andy Lau's wives at the same time Both Mrs. Laus argued in their ward everyday Most researches focus on pharmacological treatments But I'd like to restate Carl Jung's perspective That delusions, just as dreams, can be triggered by psychological factors Through psychotherapy I want to understand how patients develop delusions, hallucinations Love lives or even sexual experience Whether the lack of love is the cause of the disorder We still need one more dissertation for this conference This topic should work for you I'm not her dissertation tutor Let's see what the empress says Have you found a case study? I helped a female patient with schizophrenia before The counseling centre she went to... Promised to refer ex-mentally ill persons to me You still don't know what I'm asking You aren't usually this slow I think Dr. Fung means... Have you found any cases that support... Your dissertation on erotomania? Not yet... But I'm starting already I've been a clinical psychologist for over 30 years I've seen over 1,000 patients Yet I don't even meet one erotomaniac a year You have to submit your dissertation next year When can you find an actual case? I won't approve this topic Let's talk when you find an actual case Sorry, I'm late I'll ask my friends who are clinical psychologists See if there are any suitable cases for you Thank you I couldn't sleep again last night Didn't you say we'll open a centre together in the future? Give me back my key, okay? It's only been 2 months Is that it? The feelings are gone Give it back How many men have you given this key to? Should I change my dissertation topic? You can decide later, there's no rush I've asked some of my clinical psychologist friends They will let me know soon My research assistant just quit All my data is now a mess Can I help? You don't do much quantitative research, are you sure? I took a course before, I should be able to do it Let me think about it Let's talk tomorrow Simon Are you all right? Sorry I feel dizzy Go home first, I'll catch a taxi home Perhaps I should give you a lift? Thank you See you next week then Thank you, Miss Yip - I'm leaving, thanks - You're welcome Goodbye, Lok Bye If I want to participate in your study Is it too late? I saw myself turning into a goat I was chased by someone I was scared Who's chasing you? A little girl But... I feel like she's someone else Someone close to you? Such as... your girlfriend? Sort of Being chased in a dream... Generally means that we are afraid of something That we repress in reality Let's talk about your relationship with her Counseling is like playing football No matter how good the coach is The players still need to play the match In fact, the girl doesn't exist I saw her when I had a relapse I fell in love with her And thought we dated for 2 months Do you think I'm crazy? No, not at all I was imagining how much that must've bothered you We are all the same We have fantasy about love It's just that some people have feelings that are... More intense and dramatic than others But since this has been bothering you Shall we start with this? I know time's up You're my last patient today You can talk as much as you want Never mind, we can continue next week There's some homework I want you to do Write down how you felt when you dated your delusion As detailed as possible I'll try His mother passed away last year Did you talk about his relationship with his mother? He mentioned that his mother loved him And that no one loves him as much as she did That's an important question Why didn't you put it in your report? This could be the reason why... He thinks that no one loves him other than his morn This explains why... He doesn't dare to love in reality And ends up falling in love with his delusion I'm sorry, I never thought of it that way I think you and Lee Chi-lok have similar problems Do you remember you mentioned that... Your mom used to beat you up What did she say to you? "Even your mother doesn't want you No one wants you in this world" I did a psychological analysis for you These words made a deep impact on you It made you think that you don't deserve to be loved Remember Don't let your relationship with your mother influence your research Dr. Fung Dr. Chan Long time no see Why didn't you come to the anniversary gala last time? My counseling centre is opening soon I've been so busy Yip Nam, this is Dr. Chan This is my student, Yip Nam Hello I thought she's your daughter I treat her as one You are both welcome to the opening of my centre Sure I'm meeting someone, let's talk later Okay, see you Bye Dr. Chan will be hiring many people for her counseling centre She told me to recommend some good students Finish this dissertation first, let's see after you graduate Yes Lok Why didn't you reply my message? I don't know how to reply You either like me or you don't You're great, it's just that I'm not ready I'm sorry "Jungian Dream Interpretation" Lok Lok Lok Lok Lok... LOk! Why didn't you try to write more? I couldn't Does thinking about it upset you? I've been taking medications I'm no longer delusional Can we just forget about it? Medication can treat delusional disorder But just by taking medication... Doesn't solve the underlying problems It's just like dreaming Although dreams are not real They reflect the fears and desires that are real You don't want to face it Perhaps because it's still affecting you I always tell people How counseling has helped me My mom used to beat me up all the time If I didn't behave, she'd punish me by taking off my clothes And making me stand outside So my neighbours would look at me like I was an animal I didn't want to talk about it I even forgot about it Until I started studying psychology My professor counseled me, only then did I find out... I've always hated my morn My mom gave me this bracelet I hid it somewhere before But after my counseling session I forgave my morn And finally plucked up the courage to wear it When your scars no longer hurt That means you're truly healed Let's take a break Yan-yan Her name is Yan-yan, she lives on the floor above me What was Yan-yan like? She's very innocent Fair-skinned, beautiful She had long hair She liked to tie a pony tail Besides seeing her Did you interact with her too? I never doubted she was unreal Just like... She is no different from you... Or anyone else, we talked and spent time together You could even touch her? She's no different from a real person How about something more intimate? Did you kiss? Do you feel embarrassed? If you're uncomfortable We can talk about something else We... Kissed That's it Have you thought about getting closer with her? Yes, but... We... Never did it I just“. Masturbate? Is it necessary to talk about this? Sex is a normal thing You have it, and so do I But if you're uncomfortable Let's stop here I can write it down for you Sure Goodbye Goodbye Please Dr. Fung couldn't stop talking about your dissertation last night I told you she'd like it When you become a clinical psychologist after graduation I'm sure she'll give you lots of opportunities I'm almost done with your research data Let me know when you can give me my first payment That was quick I already told them to expedite payment Maybe I'll pay you in advance Hello Daddy is still with his student in school Mommy is not back yet? That's ridiculous Daddy will come home soon Hello, Lok? It's me, Joe You have an appointment with Miss Yip, are you here yet? Hold on I'll let Miss Yip talk to you, wait Lok Hello? He hung UP Sorry about that, Nam I never thought he'd be so irresponsible Maybe I'll call him again later, I'll try to help Lok I missed you What are you doing? You're not Yan-yan? You're Yip Nam Sorry... Lok You finally came back for counseling? No, I came back to talk with Joe If you aren't comfortable with me That's all right Sorry, I hope I didn't affect your research Maybe a little After all, your case works well for my thesis Never mind I can just change the topic and defer my graduation I wonder if we'll see each other again Bye If I go back to counseling, are you fine with it? You fell in love with Yip Nam, right? I just want to help her finish her dissertation There's nothing more to it You aren't honest with me Who understands you more than I do? I did my homework When was the first time you saw Yan-yan? It was the day after we first met Our encounter seems to be a pivotal moment Why don't you describe me as a person? What attracted you to me that day? Perhaps close your eyes Think about that day That stranger on the street How did you feel? Ling was so helpless that night She was the only one who came out to help her At that moment I felt like she's an angel When the world is mocking... Fearing and humiliating Ling... She's the only one who's willing to protect Ling As if she's protecting me I'm ill I never dare to think about love Until I met her Very good Being honest to your feelings ls not easy Don't misinterpret it I'm talking about Yan-yan Of course I know I'm not as good as you said anyway I only helped Ling out of instinct I'm sorry about what happened earlier Now you know why I don't want to talk about Yan-yan I've decided to write about my experience with Yan-yan in details I hope that'd be useful to your dissertation The days I spent with Yan-yan is the happiest time of my life The loneliness I once had Was all gone I always have to wear a mask when I'm with strangers But when I'm with Yan-yan I can truly be myself We had endless things to talk about Because we always understood each other Are you also going this way? Yes Sorry, my wife made a last minute trip back to Hong Kong I can't spend time with you tonight That's fine Maybe another time Okay It's actually my birthday today Do you live here? I realized last time when I went to see you That I can see your place from mine If you don't believe it, you can see for yourself I haven't tidied my place, it might be messy I hope you don't mind I'm Yip Nam, I'm real I should go "I'm sorry I scared you" "I'm your counselor, I shouldn't do that" "Don't worry, I won't tell the staff" "I just worry I'd drag you down, I'm a patient" "Can you really see my place from yours?" "The one with flashing lights" "Happy birthday" "Thank you for tonight, I had a great time" "Thank you" What do you like most about Yan-yan? She's genuine She never lied to me I'm free for two hours after class the day after See if that works for you Don't come up to my place anymore Where else if not your place? Your place is the safest I mean... Let's not continue like this Are you seeing someone? No I just don't want to continue this relationship Sure, that's fine I'll find another student to finish this research project then I'm sure you don't want to feel awkward "My Experience of Dating My Delusion" What do you think about me? You aren't as handsome and muscular as Eddie Peng But that's acceptable Are there things you can't accept? Are you married? No, of course not Even if you're crazy or stupid, I still love you "Yan-yan" Good morning Good morning Today's simulated counseling will be... Slightly different from our normal session On the other side of the room, my tutor... And other students will be observing So we can evaluate And improve the quality of the counseling How's your week? Not bad Still suffering from insomnia? Not as much That's great Have you thought about why? What happened? You don't want to say it? I understand You might not be used to today's setting If you prefer, we can stop anytime No I can do it I fell in love with a girl Love can bring positivity, how do you feel? But I don't think we can be together Why? I'm out of her league How about the dream you mentioned earlier? Did you have the same dream this week? Yes ls the dream any different? Lok... Have you thought that besides the goat... The boy also represents you? You mean... The goat represents me in reality And the boy symbolizes me in fantasy? Yan-yan didn't only bring you fear She also brought happiness But you are aware that... You can only live with Yan-yan in your fantasy That's why the boy tries to bury the goat Does that mean me in fantasy... ls trying to bury me in reality So I can never walk out of it? What do you think? Cemetery symbolizes your mother You think that no one loves you more than she did You couldn't let go of her But cemetery can also symbolize eternity A wedding that happens in a cemetery Represents your yearning for eternal love A dream that's too good to be true So you don't want to wake up You still don't want to forget about Yan-yan, right? No I know she's my fantasy, I want to forget her Consciously yes, but not subconsciously What does your heart tell you? This is the homework you did for me You really put your heart to it When I read it I thought it's something that happened in real life But today... You must admit that... These are all illusions It's not real Let's do a ceremony Tear it, discard it And find your true love in reality You were too aggressive just now As if you're trying to push your client To forget about his illusion and experience Our main responsibility is to Help clients realize their own thoughts Instead of telling them what to do He hasn't found true love in reality If you make him give up his dependency on his imagination It's dangerous Sorry, I was too hot-headed You should know that he has a tendency for transference He projects his emotions on me? I wasn't sure Transference is very common If handled properly It can be part of your case studies But you have to be very careful Not to have counter-transference Don't redirect your feelings toward him Generally speaking, you did a great job Counseling requires a lot of experience Keep working on it Thank you, Dr. Fung Is this where you kissed Yan-yan for the first time? What is it? You're the real one Go have some fun Here we go, it's spinning You've helped me a lot, I really appreciate it We can still be friends I'm sorry if I make you think otherwise You declined Joe's date Is he bothering you? I declined his date? Isn't that so? It's fine, I can handle it myself I want to make up an excuse to Dr. Fung So we can end our counseling earlier And try to find other cases I can't keep counseling you With our relationship right now No There are two more sessions, stick with it After you're done with counseling and your thesis No one will care about us anymore Nam It's really you, Nam Don't you remember Uncle Wong? Uncle Wong Is this your boyfriend? How's your morn? I understand This is my name card Call me if you need anything Uncle would love to catch up with you No need to clean up, I'll do it myself I'll help you get changed I can do it You're sick, let me help I said I can do it! Sorry, I just wanted to help you change your dirty clothes Do you regret being with me? Never mind, I understand You're a nice girl Why would you... It's not you You're wonderful I'm the one to be blamed What is it? If you know what I'm really like You won't want to be with me You don't mind that I'm sick What is it that I can't accept? What is it? I've been with a lot of men! I know you've had many relationships before I know that Those were in the past, I don't mind How will you not mind? That was my mom's ex boyfriend I used to have sex with him I can have sex with any men for benefits Do you understand? I wasn't forced I asked for it I asked for it! I'm a whore! No No, you didn't ask for it Did that douche bag hurt you? You're not me, how would you know better than me? I'm a cheap whore I thought I could be different from my morn But I couldn't I couldn't! I really couldn't! Don't touch me! Leave It's my fault I shouldn't have dragged you into this I told you to leave, why didn't you? I thought about it all night long I really don't mind Go ahead and cry, I'm here I don't want to cry anymore My eyes hurt I've never done it before Close your eyes and lie down I've watched those Japanese ones I know how to do it Stop making me laugh No, I'm serious Are you nervous? I don't know if it's a side effect of the medicines Sorry Kiss me What are you laughing at? Nothing Say it Why are you helping me get dressed? I worry you might catch a cold I'll hurry back to the centre first See you later Dr. Fung, let me explain How are you going to explain this? I separate my professional and private life It won't affect our counseling Or even my dissertation Shut up! I'm sorry, Joe All counseling sessions regarding this research will be put on hold Give me a day I'll explain it to the Association I hope you can keep this a secret for now I agree that our priority is... To protect our members immediately Lok Let's talk Lok Come and have a word with me Lok We found that Miss Yip has been behaving inappropriately... During your counseling sessions We have decided to terminate the counseling What's inappropriate about it? Don't worry We know it has nothing to do with you We'll protect you, no one can hurt you You think you're protecting me? Yip Nam declined your date, so you did it as a revenge What kind of man are you? Someone sent this video to me How can I not do anything about it? You've known me for so long Do you think I'm that kind of person? Lok I made the move, it has nothing to do with Yip Nam Lok Remember me? I'm Yip Nam's professor I know you want to protect her, right? She's my best student I care about her more than you do Perhaps you don't understand yet Counselors cannot have relationships with their clients Therefore this must be dealt with properly Joe I'll leave with Yip Nam first See if you need help from someone else Most importantly, try to stabilize Lok's emotions Professor Believe me She didn't hurt me Don't worry I'll try my best to help Yip Nam But you have to promise me that At this stage You can't have contact with each other I'm sure you want the best for her too, right? Give Grace Charity Association wants us to expel you What should we do now? I'm sorry We need you to promise that You won't contact any Give Grace Charity Association members Including Lee Chi-lok We'll see if it can make any mends You can punish me But I'm not longer his counselor Why can't we have contact? Are regulations more important than the client's well being? I can really help him, you can tell too I didn't say you couldn't help him But what's the use of regulations? To protect the clients As well as the clinical psychologists This is why The society trusts us Why did you want to study psychology? Didn't you say you want to be a clinical psychologist? I really like him I won't leave him Having a relationship with a mentally ill patient ls not an easy thing Yip Nam Relationships are always your weakness Before your love gets too deep Leave him That's the responsible thing to do "Yip Nam" Lok I can't find the diary What diary? You just said you want to read it Why are you leaving? Don't leave me Do you know who I am? You are not Yan-yan You're Yip Nam Are you only using me for your dissertation? So it was true I was at first, but not anymore I've changed, and you know it Then promise me You'll never leave me again Lok Yip Nam is the one you like Not me Right?

You already know it I want to hear you say it This incident Has greatly affected public's confidence to Our school and even Hong Kong's clinical psychology This caution must serve As an act of warning and deterrence Therefore, we have decided to terminate your studies But considering that you showed remorse...
