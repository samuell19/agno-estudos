Four down, six to go. Come on! - It's a good sound. - S?. Very good. Soon big boats will land in our harbor. Then much happiness. - Un buen ano. - S?. A man can't even have a decent siesta around here anymore. Hacker, wait. Please, Hacker, no more trouble. Let go, Chica. I warned him. I'll teach that Bart Thompson who's boss around here. Is that it? No, the two at the end haven't gone yet. They must've gotten wet. Give 'em a couple minutes more, and we'll plant 'em again. Right. Everybody stay away from the water. We may have a couple of live ones down there. Lou, get another charge ready. How are you coming on the road, Dumpy? Pretty slow, boss. The native workers haven't shown up yet. Oh, no. What do you suppose the reason is today? Mike Hacker. Of course Mike Hacker. I wonder what his sick excuse is gonna be. What the world are you doing? - Me? Nothing, boss. - No, no. Not again, Dumpy. Haven't I got enough on my hands today? Come on, Julio, let's go. I didn't do no harm, Senor Bart. Honest he didn't, boss. Yeah, well, if I had enough time, I'd give you both a spanking. Your father asked us to keep you away from here. - And you know that too, Dumpy. - Yeah, I know. Hacker's not my father, Senor Bart. All right, but he is your guardian, right? And he's the island manager, which means we have to get along with him. I just want to learn. I know you do, son. Ban! There's a little outboard coming into harbor! That fool's liable to get blown to kingdom come! Keep that flag waving! For Pete sakes, whoever it is is waving back. - It's Betty! - Go back, Betty! - Go back, Betty! - Go back! Turn around! You're in restricted water! Turn back! - Are you all right? - I guess so. - I'm sorry, Betty. We tried to warn you. - Oh, by taking a shot at me? That was no shot. That was a delayed-action charge. Oh. Well, I guess that makes all the difference. What in the world are you doing now? I'm going down to Davy Jones's locker for my mother's portable icebox, in which I had stashed all sorts of goodies for you guys to eat, and which I intend to eat whether you're hungry or not. Betty, wait! The water's not safe! - Ain't love wonderful? - What's happening? They just dove in for a swim. That's dangerous. There's still debris churning around down there. Yeah. Ain't love strange? Okay. Just take it easy, Betty. All right. Everybody back to work. Chuck, take another diver and check out that channel bottom. There's something strange down there. The water was ice-cold. We might have blown the lid off a subterranean river. - Check it out, will you? - Roger. Come on. When I get out at the end here, Julio, you head on for home. Don't want you to get into any trouble, now, do we? No. Julio! Come here! And you, get that foolish machine out of here. All right, all right. Next time maybe you'll stay in the cantina and do your chores like I tell you, huh? Now, you wait here. Come on, now. Come on, you've got to drink this. Bart, it's out there. I saw it. I swear! A green monster with a head the size of this room. What do I have to do to make you believe me? Excuse me for intruding on this tender little scene. Now we got a monster in here too. You'd better start learning how to knock real quick, Hacker. All the doors on this island are open to me, boss man. I come here to complain about the noise you're making. The citizenry doesn't like it. And now I find your carelessness has almost cost us the lovely Miss Piper. - It was my fault, Mr. Hacker. - Nonsense. You were supposed to put up warning signs before you started blasting. They were up! And this might not have happened - if we'd had the extra men you promised. - Men? What men? The islanders, Hacker. Remember? No, I don't remember. Okay. For two weeks, I've given you the benefit of the doubt while I've fallen behind schedule. - From now on, we bypass you. - That wouldn't be too wise. The governor of the island gave us his cooperation and, as his representative, you're supposed to do the same. Yours is cooperation, all right, but at a price, isn't it? I look out for my people. You bet you do. Ban! - Bart! - What's wrong? If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe it. - What? - The monster? - Two of them, Betty. - Two what? What are you babbling about? Two huge, ugly dinosaurs perfectly preserved at the bottom of the channel. Are they dead? Frozen solid. - Million-year-old dinosaurs? - The same, Bart. I don't know what else they could be. But I'll tell you one thing. - One look and you'll never forget 'em. - You see? This ought to be worth a fortune. We must've blasted through the rock that entombed them. Some compressed gas caused the freezing, I guess. As island manager, I demand you bring those things up! Tread lightly. You don't demand anything around here today. - Is the governor still in Washington? - So far as I know, he is. And that leaves me in complete charge of this island. We'll send him a wire and have him contact the Smithsonian. He'll send paleontologists down here right away, and we'll bring the critters up and put them on the beach. - You think the big crane will handle 'em? - I think so. Get her set up, and I'll be with you in a minute. Can I trust you to send this? You have my word. And a witness. All right, here. - What are you grinning about? - Was I grinning, boss man? Maybe it's just that this time, after all your whining, you've caused your own delay. We can't build a harbor around two dinosaurs, Hacker. So we take a couple hours and move 'em, and we get right back to work with no more delays. Bravo. You were awfully hard on him, weren't you, Bart? I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw a- a dinosaur. Let's go monster fishing. Okay, Lou, we're all hooked up. Bring her in nice and easy. Are they really dinosaurs, Senorita Betty? - Yes, Julio, they are. - Boy, this is terrific! Keep her coming, Lou. Well? What do you think, Bart? Thank goodness he's not alive. You can say that again. - Let's get our hooks in the next one. - Roger. Is that what you saw? You scared me. With him around? Thanks a lot. I just can't get over it. - Is he alive, Senor Bart? - No, he's not alive. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. Then why are his eyes open? Well, he just- He just slept with them open, that's all. Boy, he's magnifico. That's for certain. Wait till you see the next one. They tell me he's even bigger. He must weigh about 50 tons. He doesn't look as mean as the other one. He's not mean. He's herbivorous. Where did you learn a word like that? Oh, I'm well educated in those things. I sent away a cereal box tops and got models just like them, only smaller. Can I go up and see them closer? - Okay, Professor. - Oh, thanks, Senor Bart. Senor Bart, he's very cold. Yeah, he's what you might call kind of quick-frozen. How long has he been that way? Million years or so, I guess. Boy, oh, boy! I'd better investigate further! Hey, look. Why don't you go change while I get things wrapped up here, and then we'll whisk away to a romantic spot for dinner. The only restaurant on the island. But you've got to admit it's the best cuisine in a thousand-mile radius. - Okay, I'll be ready in a few minutes. - Okay. Hey, Bart. You think we ought to leave a guard for our little playmates tonight? Yeah, I guess so. I don't see how anyone's gonna walk off with them though. Give him half a chance, and Hacker would try. - I'll see you later. - Okay. - Senor Bart! - What's the matter? He's alive! Look! Oh, no. No, no. He's just thawing out. - Then will he be alive? - Nope. Hey, don't you think you'd better head on home? No. Senor Hacker told me to wait in the car. I guess I'd better. Okay. O'Leary? Off and on, me bucko! T.J. O'Leary at your service, boss. O'Leary, I got a job for you tonight- babysitting. With whose children? Those dinosaurs over there. Oh, saints preserve us. Them are really there? Oh, thank the good Lord. I've been seeing them all afternoon and was afraid to tell anyone for fear it was the DTs! Sure, if they be needin' diapering, you can find some tarpaulins behind the shed. Oh, sure, boss! Sure! And they ain't the first dinosaur I've ever seen, you know. Why, your timing's perfect. Are you wrinkle-free and ready to go? Yeah. If we hurry, we'll make it there before the rain does. It sure gets dark fast down here. Everything happens fast in the tropics. Who is it? It's me, Jasper. Come in. It's about time you got here. It was stormy and wet out tonight, Mr. Hacker. Fine, fine. I don't need your weather report. Sit down and shut up. I'll do the talking. We're going to be rich, boys. You hear that, Chica? I heard, Hacker. You don't sound too happy about it. Should I be? Why, sure. You're my little tamale, aren't you? - Leave me alone, Hacker. - "Leave me alone, Hacker." I don't hear you telling the turistas ?Leave me alone." - Let me go. You are hurting me. - I am going to be rich, Chica. Dress you in pretty things, soft to the touch. - I don't want your money. - But I want you. And I know certain things about you that certain authorities would like to find out. - Lies! - They'll lock you up in jail until your pretty face is old and wrinkled. All you know is lies! Maybe so. But who will be believed, huh? You or the island manager? So you see, Chica... you are mine. Why not enjoy it? And now leave us alone, my little tamale. We have some business to discuss. I have found a caveman. Perfectly intact. Probably a million years old. We are going to take him to the mainland and sell him for a fortune. You mean he's dead? Of course he's dead. He's prehistoric. That's what makes him so valuable. What's my cut? Yeah, and mine? A thousand dollars apiece for helping me get him to the boat as soon as the storm lets up. - It's a deal. - Yeah, right. It's a deal. Telegram. Help yourself to some food, boys. Hey, how are you farin', my fine, strapping babes? A- teethin', are ya? Well. You're a very sweet and quiet babe not to be shriekin' about it. And you too. Mustn't play favorites. Well, I'm going in where it's warm, boys. You be good now and sleep tight. Hey, Julio. What you got there? Oh, these are my monsters I got from my cereal box tops. I thought I'd bring them over to show you. Say, those are really something. Hey, Chuck, look. This one's the brontosaurus. He's a vegetarian. He wouldn't hurt you unless you got in his way and he stepped on you. But this one's the mean one, the tyrannosaurus. He's got a bigger brain and a bigger appetite. He eats meat, and he likes to eat brontosaurus, even better than people. Well, I'll be darned. You really know a lot about these things, don't you? Oh, yes, Senor Bart. I play with them all the time. They are my friends. Julio! What the devil are you doing out here? You're going to learn when I tell you to stay in the back room and finish your chores quietly, that is exactly what I mean! - Take it easy, Hacker! - You keep your nose out of this. I'm sorry, Sefior Hacker! I won't do it again! You're going to learn a lesson, boy. Oh, no, senor, please! That's my friend! Hacker, that's enough. Now come here, boy. I hate you! I'm gonna run away and never come back! All right, go ahead! See if I care! Julio, wait! If anything happens to that boy, I swear I'll take it out of your hide. Julio? - You couldn't find him. - No, I couldn't. Don't come another step closer, boss man, or I'll... You'll what? I'll slash you to ribbons. Somebody bandage him up. A little fortification and then we'll go out and see what that last bit 0' lightnin' has done to our babes. Earthquakes too! Ha! This place is ridiculous. Did you ever see such a sight in your life? I- I swear, I'll never take another drink as long as I live! Good girl. I wonder how long it'll be before the lights come on again. The last time something happened to our generator, it was two days before they fixed it. They didn't have any power on this whole island for two days? Yes, except for some of the houses on the hills. They have their own generator. Storm's about over. Round up some of the boys. We'll go have a look. Right. No! No! Go away! No! Let me go! Oh, no! Let me out! Help! Help! Oh, let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Help! They've 9011- Let me down! Oh, you wild beast! Let me down! Help! - What was that? - It wasn't thunder, that's for sure. - It sounded like dynamite. Come on. Chuck! - Roger. Let's go! Hurry up! They'll be too close to our prize package. No dinosaurs, no shack. And worst of all, no O'Leary. Hey, boss! O'Leary's hat. You think he's dead? Nobody could live through that kind of an explosion, Dumpy. Poor guy. What happened to the dinosaurs? Bart! Come here! It looks like the big one just up and walked away. Walked away? How could he walk away if he's dead? - It isn't possible. - What are we going to do? Uh-oh. Look. What are you doing, Hacker? I was looking to see- to see if Julio was around here. Under the leaves? You can do better than that. A fat lot you care what happens to that boy. Will you get your hands off me? I've had a change of heart. Okay, I was wrong this time. You had nothing to do with this. You don't know what that sound was, do you? A bird? That's a dinosaur, Hacker. A big, hungry, flesh-eating dinosaur. You mean... We gotta get back to town and start making phone calls for help. - The phones are out, Bart. - The overseas phone. - Everything's out. - How do we get word out, Hacker? Mail boat will be in tomorrow morning. By tomorrow, we could all be dead. Doesn't anyone here have a shortwave radio? Some of the fishing boats have some, but they won't be back till the end of the week. When can we get an answer to that wire? I... I didn't get around to sending it. Well, that's just great. Bart, I wish my dad wasn't away. He's got some sort of radio rig. - A shortwave radio? - Yes, he's a ham operator. But he's always taking it apart. I don't know if it's working. At least it's something to go on. I think I can get it to work. Meantime, we've got to figure out some way of defending ourselves. How many weapons are there on the island? Some small-game guns, a couple of pistols. But what good would they be against those monsters? And there's a relic cannon up at the old fortress. - That might not be a bad idea, Bart. - A relic cannon? No, the fortress. I was up there last Sunday. It's just some old ruins, but the walls are thick and fairly high. And there's what's left of a moat around the place. We could widen it and burn oil as a barrier. That sounds like our best idea. Get the bulldozers and whatever else you need to get set up at the fortress. - Right. - Tell everybody on the way up there. Hey, boss, maybe if I rang the fire gong, we could get them all out in a hurry. No, no. All we need is a couple hundred frightened people running through town. That monster will know where his next meal's coming from. How about us with the heavy equipment? I don't think he'll bother you if you travel in a tight convoy. - Drive with your lights out. - Roger. Let's go, guys. Come on. We've got work to do. You girls go on with Chuck. Dumpy and I will spread the word in town, and we'll get to your house and see if that radio's working. - Bart, my mother's home all alone. - Don't worry. We'll bring her back. How about you, Hacker? Are we gonna get any help from you? I've got to go find my boy. I feel terrible. He means so much to me. I will risk the danger. I'll take my men, and we'll go search the island. I understand. We'll keep a lookout too. You see, Bart? Nobody's all bad. Senor Bart, when I was a little girl in another country, there was a revolution. My father taught me how to make bombs out of bottles and gasoline. - We'll use some, no? - We'll use some, yes. - Run and tell Chuck that. - Okay. Hey, boss. There's a couple of walkie-talkies in the tool shed. Should I get 'em? We'll keep in touch with Chuck. - That's a good idea, Dumpy. - Okay. Bart, I'm going with you. No, you're not. It's a lot safer for you at the fortress. We may never get there. If something happens, I want to be with you. Is that you, Betty? How was the boy dressed, Mr. Hacker? I didn't notice. Don't be so style-conscious, Jasper. We're looking for the caveman, not that brat. I knew you hadn't changed. Remember, you're the friendly vegetarian, like it says on the cereal box. Hey, you are friendly. We are going to be friends, you and me. That's the bad tyrannosaurus! You'd better run and find a swamp to hide in, where he won't follow you. 'Cause if he catches us, he'll eat both of us up. And he'll like you better than me 'cause you're bigger. And I don't want him to eat you, so please run! I know you don't know which way to run, and I wish I could tell you. But you see, I'm just a boy and I'm lost 'cause I don't go out at night by myself, and I don't know where the swamps are. You see? You've got to go! Please run! I can't push you! That a boy! Run, run! And keep running! Good-bye, my friend. I hope I will see you again soon. Take care of yourself. Tom, tell everyone to go quickly and quietly. Once they get to the fortress, they should just relax. - Dumpy, let's go! - Okay, boss! Hey, boss, it's a dud, ain't it? No, you have to light that cloth tail, Dumpy. But a spark could do it. - Put them in here. - Yeah, boss. Put them on something soft so they don't get jostled. - And no smoking. - You ain't kiddin'. XLN2W calling LNR6J. XLN2W calling LNR6J. Do you read me? Over. XLN2W calling LNR6J. XLN2W calling LNR6J. Come in, please. XLNZW calling- I wish we could go faster. These roads don't help any. We are almost there, Chuck. Mousey! - Did you find him? - Nope. The whole back part is filled with water, Mr. Hacker. That's why they closed this place. They haven't used it in years. Let's get out of here. This place gives me the creeps. Jasper seems to be enjoying it. Huh, Jasper? Sure, boss. It's very interesting. I mean, where else are you going to find a caveman except in a cave? ?In a cave." ?In a cave.? Jasper, your intelligence never ceases to amaze me. I didn't know you were an anthropologist. Not a very good one, boss. I mean, I ain't been to church in years. Ah, well, if he's not in a cave, maybe he's in a house. Come on. We'll start looking in houses. Is there anyone else living out this way we could warn? No. Ours is the next place, and it's the last one. Betty? Senorita Betty? Holy smoke! A real caveman! You want this? Boy, you sure are hungry. I guess maybe you are a houseguest of Betty's scientist father, the doctor, huh? More? Funny they didn't show you where the food was. Come on, I'll show you. See? We're in luck! We've got some pie. See? You take those things over to the table while I make us something warm to drink. I don't think Betty would mind. You really don't know much about these things, do you? I'll be your friend. I'll show you. Come on, caveman, come on. Come on. Right here. No. Eat with your fork. Like this. Eat right. Eat like this. With your fork. That must be Betty. Come on. Surprise her. Show her how I taught you how to eat with a fork. Surprise! There he is. Get the kid out of the way, and get him with as few blows as is possible. Run, caveman! Run! They're bad men! No! No, caveman! It's not right to kill! You two are worthless. Stand back. Let a man at him. You got the rope? Yeah, boss. Right here. All right. I'll pin him down, you bind his hands and feet. What are you standing there for? Get out and get him, or I pity both of you! Go on! Come on. They can't be far ahead. Come on. If we have to run all night, we're going to catch them. Come on. Top speed. Mother? There's nobody here, that's for sure. Boy, this place is a mess. Mother! Yeah, and whoever busted this up sure did a thorough job. Boy, they sure did. Mother! - Better calm her down. - You think... I don't know. She's not here, Bart. Something's happened. I know it. Come on, calm down. Keep your chin up. Look, her car's gone. She could be in town, or she might be at the fortress already with Chuck. - Do you think she might be? - There's a good chance. Besides, going to pieces isn't going to help a bit. Somebody had a sloppy feast in here, Bart. And the teakettle's still boiling. Whoever was here didn't leave long ago. Dumpy, go out to the jeep and see if you can contact Chuck on the walkie-talkie. He should be at the fortress by now. Gotcha, boss. - What do we do now? - We'll head for the fortress. See if you've got kerosene lanterns. We could use them. Okay, I'll get them. Hey, boss! Yeah? Yeah, Chuck, sure. Just a minute. Here he comes now. Betty's mother is safe. Oh, good. Tell Betty and give her a hand, will you, Dumpy? - I sure will. - Yeah, Chuck? Yeah, Bart. So far, so good. Not a sign of the monsters. And we're making pretty good progress with the moat. If we could be sure of a couple more hours, I'd say we'd have it secured. - How about the islanders? - We got most of them in from the village. There are more coming from the hills all the time. They're frightened. I can't say that I blame them. When I stop to think of it, I get pretty scared myself. I know what you mean. - How about Julio? - Not a sign of him. We'll keep our eyes peeled for him on the way back. I'd comb the jungle if I thought there was a chance of finding him alive. Don't be a fool, Bart. You'll have a hard enough time just getting back here. I know. - She said she saw an ape man? - That's what she said, Betty. She probably was so frightened she really didn't know what she saw. At least she's all right. You want to take these out and put them in the jeep? I'll get a first-aid kit in case we need it. And don't be too long, because the sooner we get back to those fortress walls, the better I'll feel. Okay. Hey, boss? Boss? Boss, where are you? Over here, Dumpy. Look what I found. Hacker's car. Uh-oh. I wonder what he's got to do with that mess inside? And the broken radio. Check under the seats. I don't know what to look for, but I wouldn't put anything past that man. Bart, it's Julio! Dumpy, we've got to get that boy! Hurry, Bart, hurry! Julio, we're coming! We may need those. Come on! Boy, you sure are one terrific caveman, you know that? I never had so much fun in my life! I didn't know you could ride a dinosaur. Julio! Julio! - What are we gonna do? - Julio, it's me, Betty! Senorita Betty, run! Go away! Look out behind you! He saved her life, but there's no telling what he might do next. Come on! This way. I'm lost, boss. Any idea where we are? The house is back that way. We just got to keep going. Through here. Whoa! Please stop! We'll be right back where we started, and the tyrannosaurus will eat us up! You saved my life. I really don't know how to thank you. I'm very grateful. You want me to cook it? Your dinner. I think you ought to know something before I start. I'm not a very good cook. You don't care, huh? Okay. One rabbit, medium-rare. Hope that's how you like it. I hope you don't have anything else on your mind. Wristwatch. Now, now. Nice caveman. Just sit there, and I'll go fix things in the kitchen. Now, let's see. What does a nice caveman do after a hard day's work in the jungle? No, no, don't tell me. Let me think of something tame on my own. Like sitting down. And we'll keep all other thoughts out of our romantic little Neanderthal minds. Okay? Let's see. Maybe if I sing you a song, you'll fall asleep, and then I can run away from you, hmm? Lullaby and good night Go to sleep, little caveman Leave my friend alone, you bad old tyrannosaurus! Talk about ringside seats. Hit him again with your tail! Come on! Hit him! Oh, no! Boss, look over there. Boss, I don't see the kid anymore. He's on the other side. The way they're spinning around, he could get crushed. Come on, we got to get him. Not that way. That's quicksand! No! No! Julio! The caveman again. Follow him, we'll get to Betty too. - There he is, men. - Yeah. Yeah, but look at that monster. We're going in to get that caveman. I don't want the money, boss. - It's too late for that now, Jasper. - I'm sorry, boss. I quit. Jasper, come back here! We've got to get him away from that cave. Now! Come on, Mr. Hacker, have a heart. I'm telling you, Mousey, it'll be perfectly safe. Get in through that opening, climb down on the rope, take him prisoner, and bring him out when the coast is clear. I'm scared of the monster and the bomb too, Mr. Hacker. One. I'm tired of being disobeyed, Mousey. I'm ashamed of myself. I really am. Two. I mean business this time. You know I'd do anything for you. You know that, Mr. Hacker. But this... this will be suicide. - Three. - Okay, okay. I'll go. Mousey, you yellow coward! I'll kill you! I'll do it myself. That mine shaft's nothing but a bunch of rotted timbers. It can't hold much longer the way he's going at it. And these things don't bother him a bit. Maybe if I could pop one right in his mouth, he'd decide to beat it out of here. Boss, that's a good trick if you can do it. When I tell you, you throw one of those bombs as close to his eyes as you can. That'll attract his attention. It'll let me get within a couple of feet, where I can't miss. Okay. Mr. Hacker, thank goodness you're here. Don't anybody move. Blasted rope. Now we have to wait for the monster to leave before we can get out. Unless we give him some distraction while the others leave. - You must be crazy! - Is that what you think? Do you know how much money people all over the world will pay to look at that monkey man? Oh, what is this? Bravery, huh? Little man, I could puncture holes in you with this play toy of mine. He doesn't know what a gun is. He's just a nice, kind- Leave him alone! Don't worry, boy. I won't hurt him. He's going to be my fortune. And you- you are going to be my way out of here. No, Hacker, no! I'm getting out of here! We got rid of him for a while. - Yeah. Boy, is he mad! - Let's get in there. Betty, Julio, are you all right? - Oh, Bart. - Come on, let's get out of here. Let's go! Caveman! Caveman! Go on, go on! - Get him out of here. - Caveman! Caveman! - Come on, caveman! - Come on! Come on! Couple more minutes, and that dinosaur is gonna remember he's hungry again. Did Hacker get out? Yeah. Caveman! Where is the caveman! Come on! Look! Look, he's heading for the quicksand! Now's our chance. Head back to the jeep. I'm gonna take another look around here just in case. Be careful. I will. Now hurry. Caveman! Caveman! Caveman! We got a ditch all around the fortress except on the side overlooking the ocean. We just open those drums, put a torch to the oil, and we got a moat of flames. Good. Is everyone in the fortress? Yeah, everybody except for the guys in the equipment. And there's a little path over there they can go up in case they get caught outside when the fire starts. You've done a good job, Chuck. We got enough oil? That's the problem. The moat had to be bigger than I anticipated. How many minutes of flame can you give me? Five, maybe, if we're lucky. - No sign of the boat yet? - No. Pedro? Quieres comer? I'm not hungry. You should eat something, Julio. A growing boy needs- I don't want to grow anymore. The mail boat will soon be here. You're probably going to get that airplane from the cereal box. I don't care about any airplane. Well, remember, there's a good bowl of soup if you want it. What are you seeing out there, Dumpy? Nothing. And right now, that looks mighty good to me. Are you taking care of the alarm? Hey! Huh? Monster! Take it easy. Relax. The monster's not here yet. But you keep your eyes open, and you'll be a fine alarm man. S?', senor. Sorry. Sorry, senor. I hope the rest of our setup is better than that. Don't worry about him. If that monster comes within a mile of this place, that bell will be ringing. He's here! Sound the alarm! Dinosaurus! Monster! We got to hold it off as long as possible. - It's holding him. - Yeah, but for how long? - You're in charge. I got an idea. - Hey, wait a minute! Bart! Bart! - Bart, let me come with you. - I can't. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna knock that monster off the cliff. I love you. I can't hear you. Be careful. I love you. Chica. Hey, Chuck, do you think we can drive the bulldozer through the fire? Not a chance, Dumpy. Why? To help Bart. Look what he's doing. Come on, Senor Bart! Get him! Watch out, Senor Bart! Dumpy, if you've ever prayed, do it now. - Oh, Senor Bart. - Bart, are you all right? - Bart, that was terrific. - Oh, thank heavens. - Wasn't he great? - Senor Bart, why did the caveman have to die? Well, Julio... there's a time for everything. The caveman slept all those years, and then one day he awoke like Rip Van Winkle... and found the world so changed that he didn't belong in it anymore. How would you like it if you woke in the 21st century? No, house, no friends, even the town gone. Just a strange world. I would like it. You know, I bet you would at that. I'll bet one day you will wake in the 21st century. You really mean it? Yeah. Oh, boy! There you are, my dear. There's your tropical island. Look at all those people up there waving at us. Do you suppose they greet all the ships like this? I shouldn't be at all surprised. On a peaceful, quiet island like this, I don't suppose they have anything better to do.
