- Ever since I met Tom when I was a kid, I wanted to be a race car driver. Tom, may I have your autograph, please? On that, my very first day on the race track, I knew I wanted to go as fast as possible. Speed. That was all I wanted. - We're enjoying a beautiful day at the stock racing here at the Monterrey Speedway. - Yes, we are, Lupio. Right now, let's take a look at the contenders. - Rogelio Ramirez from Team Seman Baker's in the pole position. Roger's a driver only needs a little extra push to get him over the top and it looks like he may do it. In the second spot is Ricardo Fernandez from Telmex/Red Bull. He's been having a great season while chasing the coveted title of Rookie of the Year. Third spot belongs to Freddy Balbanera of Xtreme/Seman Baker. Rogelio's teammate and a constant force on the track. Taking fourth is Canel's own Andres Asunsulo Jr. The current champion is also the biggest nemesis for Rogelio Ramirez. - Zooming for first place are the cars from Semen Baker and Telmex. But watch out, the Xtreme car is coming up the left. - This one's mine. - Yes, it's Freddy. He comes up the left side and speeds up to the top position. - Feeling fresh today, huh, Freddy? - Shocking to see Canel's car lagging so far behind. - What's up, Freddy? Ready to eat some dust? Here I go. - This is a power fight, a man's fight. Man against man, strength verus power, Telmex and Xtreme. Meanwhile, The FedEx car dukes it out with Asunsulo. What a race! FedEx tries to get ahead on the outside as we enter the final lap and the audience is cheering on its feet. - I said, it won't be so easy. - It's a fight to the finish to the checkered flag and a photo finish. It's Semen Baker's Rogelio in first place. He doesn't let up for Xtreme coming up on the left. Here comes the checkered flag! Rogelio Ramirez of Semen Baker wins the race. Second goes to Xtreme and third to Telmex. - Well done, Freddy! - This one puts Rogelio 15 points ahead of Canel's Andres. It's interesting to note that Canel in the sixth place at this point in the season, when points begin to weigh heavily. - See ya later. - The keys. - Very good. You know this track like nobody else. But the fact is, Andres drove terribly. And that's why you won. Make sure that the next time he loses, is because you win, hm? - He's taking too long. - Mm. Mm, mm. - Hello. Alvarito! How are you, brother, what's up? You would have to congratulate Roger. He's the one who races, not me. No, no, I don't gamble. If I bet one cent, my daughter would have my head. Sure, I'll stop by for a little while and say hello, but I won't play, okay? All right, see you later. Ciao. I won't gamble, I'm just goin' for a while. - Good evening, sir, your ticket. - Thanks, take good care of it. - Don't worry. - Look who's here. - Who won? Who won? - It's the winner! Come here. We got the future champ right here, future champ. Are you having dinner? They serve a mean duck here. - I'm not hungry, Jimmy. - Waiter, waiter, come here! He'll have the duck, with plenty of prune sauce, got it? The phone's been ringing off the hook with congratulations. Even Viagas called. That guy doesn't even call to borrow money. He, he said you drove magnificently. - Or Andres drove terribly. - Ah, we hadn't won in white a while. We won and that's what matters. Compared to Andres, you race better. - Yes, but compared to myself, I could've done better. - Excellent, that's the way to talk. See, darling, that's why I let you marry this kid. Now for the next thing. - What's that? We're finally going to race in the US? - Come on, you know I don't have the money for that. But Julieta's already working on new sponsors. Isn't that right, dear? - Yes, but tonight's different. Why? Because we won, Jimmy. Huh? - Again? - I'm going out with Freddy and I'll be back soon. Huh? - I'll drive you home, okay? - Thank you. Easy on my car, pal. - That's what it's for, man. Can I get your car, sir? - No, we would rather take a taxi. - Hey, Freddy. - Oof. And how was dinner? - You know. Total drag. - Total drag. He's part of the package. - Yeah, but what a drag. - Yeah. Look out, he's coming! When will you stop collecting that junk? - Never, I think. - You know what I love? That smooth space between your car and the other cars at 175 miles an hour. Those fractions of a second that you get to make a decision. That's where you're gambling with life and death. Case in point. - Ah. - Ah. - Don't be so dense, man. - I went too far. Tell me. What do you think? - What springs did you have on, the 400 or the 450? - 450. - And I beat you with a 400. - Hey, hey, hey. Easy, tiger. I let you win, just for today. When are you going to finish that classic? - I only have to put that motor together. What have we here? Ah. Ludwiga is fine. - Sometimes I get bored. - Where did these come from? - Ah. They were my father's. - Were? - Yeah. I stole them. He said I couldn't use them until I became a champ. - One of these days. - Wise guy! - That's not a chess match, man. - Tell me, what are you doing later? - Oh, are you gonna join me? - Do you remember Pedos? - Hi. - You are not playing very well, Andres. - I've never had a good aim. - I'm not talking about pool. - You mean the race? I had a bad day. - Bad? Terrible. - You think it was that bad? - No, there were a few people who like what you did. - Like me, for instance. - Like Roger, for instance. - That Rogelio is an easy take down. - You don't have that many races left. - The same number as him. - No, thanks. - You don't like it? - As a matter of fact, I'm a great pool player. - So, then? - Let's just say I wouldn't want to see you lose twice in the same day. - Sol, Andres. - Hi. How are you? - You're still having problems with your team, aren't you? - If I had a good car, Rogelio wouldn't be celebrating. Look, you know I have a good sponsor in Canel's. I practically own the joint, so I will never be lacking in sponsorship. What I really need is a good team. - How bizarre. Because maybe we could be that good team. Right? How about some drinks? - Sure, we have to celebrate, right? This way. - Look, man, what you have to do is ask your engineer to change these things, the spring nozzles. These are the regular ones, but I put larger ones on his car so there could be more fuel injection, which gives it more power. - So, that's why it doesn't perform? - That's why it feels like it's not accelerating when you floor it. - Which is what was happening to my car before, right? - Of course, did you see how this guy passed you coming out of the curves? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Well, it's because of that. - Hello. - Good day, ma'am. - Hi. - I need to talk to you. I'm Andrea Segovia from Jack and Harry Racing. - What can I do for you? - Could we speak privately? - Excuse me, fellas. - I guess she knew him back when he had hair. - I have a proposition for you. My team is looking for drivers. - I don't think it's such a good idea to switch teams at this point in the season. - Well, it's not just about switching teams, Roger. It's about winning the championship with the backing of a strong team. Besides, it could lead you to driving in the US or in Europe. - Couldn't we wait until the end of the season? - Look, we'll be testing prospects tomorrow at the track. I'll see you at 10? See you soon. - Goodbye. - What? Are you trying to steal my toys? - These things don't happen often. I could have said no 1,000 times. I wanted more. I always wanted more. Who doesn't want more? - I feel we have to rethink things between us. I don't know, maybe slow down and figure out what's going on? Things may be seemingly well between us, but, I don't think we are where we imagined ourselves to be. We have to make a decision. What do you think? What are you thinking about? - I'm thinking about leaving your father's team. What is it? Are you all right? - I'm fine. Were you listening-- - Yes, you said we have to make a decision. No? - And? - Well, I'm making a decision. Julieta, are you feeling hormonal? - No, I am not. - So, you have reached a decision? - Yes. Yes, I have. - Place your bets. - Have you all met Sofia? - Hello. - Hello, Sofia. - Hello, Sofie. - Hello, Sofie. I trust you'll bring me good luck, Sofie? - Of course. - Down, doggies, down. - Look at that. - Glad to see you, sir. - It looks like you're the only one around here who's glad to see me. - Why would I be glad to see you, if every time you come here, you take all my money? - Because you have fun with me, you admire me. I'm a good role model for you. - I don't even know why I invite you. - The turn, bets. - Quit gambling. - I'll call. - I pass. - I thought you quit gambling? - Would you leave a lover who treats you so well? Check. - Fifth card, the river. Any bets? - All right. All right, let's see 100. - Call. - Two pairs, sevens and fours. - Very good hand, but not good enough. Seven and king. I'm back, gentlemen! - That's what I get for inviting you. - Let it ride. - Cheers. - And so, the hare hopped in his Shelby Cobra, his Mustang, and drove off! And the turtle was driving along slowly. Dah-dun, dah-dun, dah-dun. In his little car. - And the fastest car belongs to Richie Fernandez! - Hey, kids, how are you? - Fine. - Pay no attention to Top Driver here. Now, there's a real car. - Old, bald and fat. Roger Ramirez! - Oh, sure, Mr. Skinny. - Who wants to be this guy? This is Freddy Balbanera. - Just remember to be careful on those curves, eh? Okay? - This one goes in the back, too bad for. And this one is the new bullet of the speedways. The one from team Jack and Harry. - Okay, gentlemen. - Okay, gentlemen. Start your engines! Get ready, set, go! It's Richie Fernandez in the top spot, followed closely by Freddy Balbanera! Huge accident! - Hey, an accident. - The pace car comes in to assist. - Of course I'm interested. Do they know that my background is mostly motor vehicles? I can certainly work in other fields. Yes, I have it here. I'll check it now and yeah, I'll send it to you today. Thanks, thanks a million. Bye. - It breaks my heart seeing what cancer does to these kids. - Yeah, it's a good thing we came. Hey, man, so what's up with Andrea? - Nothing. They've made me an offer. - Yes, I know. Brother, you've got all the cards on the table. Daytona, Europe, you could reach the big-time, daddy-o. - Would you do it? - Let me think about it. Sure. Obviously. - See you later. - You got it. Hey, what's up, champs? What happened, why is my car in the pits? Am I out of the game or what? - They called you, too? Looks like they'll let anyone on this team. - This part, this was much better than the last one. - Okay, that's perfect, yeah. - Good morning. - I thought you weren't coming? - It's a very tempting offer. Hi. - Hi. - Hello, I'm Marco. - Hi, I'm Regelio Ramirez. - Nice to meet you. - So, what springs are on it? - The 550. - Can we try it with the 600, so it drives a bit stiffer? - Sure, we can try. The 600, please. - Let me get to it. - Go on. - There's only one winner in the season. We need one experienced driver, not two. - Yeah, but both of them are in the running for the championship. Besides, Andres made us an offer we couldn't refuse. - What? - He'll pay for the rest of the season. I'll tell you about it later. - Harry. Control yourself. - What do you think of this guy? - I think so, he'd be a good option. - How did he do, Marco? - He did great. He was half a second under Andres. - Excellent. - Yes, very good. - Congratulations, Roger. - Thanks, how was it? - Very good, half a second faster than Andres. - Very good time, how was the car? - Traction's okay, but it gets a little loose coming out of turn two. - Look, I'm pushing for you, but you know how these things are. We're very interested in you racing for us. I think we can reach an understanding. - I think so, too. - I gave Jack and Harry their start. And they betrayed me. They took Herdez and now they're trying to take you, too. Hiding under these cards is a great hand. How do I know? Because it doesn't matter. It could be a pair of aces, or a pair of fours. The only thing that matters is who the player is. You were that pair of fours, my weakest hand. I made you. I've taken you where you are and now you say, "I'm gone?" - You've always said that the best moment to take risks is when you have nothing to lose. - You have nothin' to lose with me. But against me, you have much to lose. - Against you, Jimmy? Not being with you is being against you? - Being against me is not having me, and that is a great loss for you. We'll see how it goes with those two, those two who don't love you, who aren't your family. Just make sure you don't lose. I don't wanna have to throw your ass out when you come walking back through that door. - Hey, let's go get some cold ones. What a temper. - Good evening, welcome. Would you care to have some wine with your dinner? - Yes, bring me one from the Colchagua Valley. - Let's see, Colchagua Valley, Chilean wine. - There is this beautiful valley in Chile, the Colchagua, and the road there is completely surrounded by vineyards. Truly an extraordinary thing. - To tell you the truth, I really don't know much about wine, but I've been trying to learn all my life. After maybe two weeks, you really start to see a substantial change and a different perspective as a race car driver. - One of my worst champagne stories. I ended up making love in a Formula 1 car. You can fit anything in a Formula 1 car, if you know how to. - Do you like the donkey, Andy? - Very good. - Speaking of curves, many years ago, Madame Pompadour made the original champagne glasses. The classic ones, out of which molds? Her own breasts, that's why they are like this! Now, the king gets jealous, and guess what he use as a mold for champagne flutes? - No. Are you always this quiet? - Actually, I don't understand a thing. Hi. Are you gonna be long? - In reality, the best thing would be to change the engine, but we don't have the budget. - How much am I losing, eh? - Not much, 10, 12, 15, chump change, no big deal. - Are we screwed or not? - Not at all. But there is one switch we have to fix. - Huh? - The one from your balls to the gas pedal. - Freddy! - Are we happy today? - I'm lookin' at the next champion! - Well, I don't see how, with this motor. I mean, it can take it a few more races, but not the whole season. - I told you to adjust the motor, nothing more. And what do you know about drivin' a car? Freddy is the one who drives the car. He's the important one. - Your ticket. You're in the first flight out, and don't worry, you're gonna be fine. - Thank you, I'm so nervous. I should've done this a long time ago, right? - Well, we all knew it, but you had to decide for yourself. - I haven't told him. - Really, you haven't told him? - I'm not going to tell him at all, what for? He won't notice anyway. - You can leave your things here. - Boys, these are your cars. - If he behaves, you can show him the room with the Mustangs. - It goes without saying that aggressiveness is this team's calling card, that is why Herdez/Quaker presents Rogelio Ramirez, the most aggressive driver of the past two seasons, who is presently in the running for the championship. - It is also an honor to present our newest driver, Andres Asunsulo Jr., also a contender for the cup who joins us with his sponsor and now our new partner, Canel's. Rebecca, please do the honors. - Ladies and gentlemen, presenting race car drivers, Andres and Roger. - Oh, I almost forgot, whoever comes out on top at the end of the season will get to race in the US! - And now, questions and answers. - Over here, over here! - Hey, Roger, over here. How do you feel with this team change? - Well, it is certainly a better platform for winning. - Andres, Andres, over here. - And you, Andres. - Over here, look, Andres. - I asked my dad about switching teams and he said, "Andy. "Go." In all seriousness, I know we have a great team. It is an honor to be racing with someone like Rogelio. A rival is someone who races against me. Rogelio will no longer be one, unless he doesn't have what it takes. - And who's the number one driver here? - Well I-- - Me, of course. - Are there plans to race abroad? - Um, it's... - Let's hope this team will be a good springboard for racing in the US next year. - What's your opinion of Telmex? - They are-- - Well they are a very good team, always have been. - And you, Roger? - They are a great team and we'll see them on the track. - Well, the truth is that I hate rich people. And God punished me for it. What can we do? - Roger, let me introduce you to the team. Maria, my yoga instructor. - Hello. - Tony, my psychiatrist. - Nice to meet you. - Rabdo, our lawyer, and Xavier, our financial advisor. - Nice to meet you. - Good meeting you. - This is the season's most promising racer. My apologies for Harry, but he asked if he could escort Rebecca home, for which I thanked him immensely. - I understand. - Well, cheers. - Cheers. Excuse me. - This boy really knows how to drive. Knows how to drive. - Thank you. - Yeah, I'm glad you came. - Oh, thank you. - Your call is being redirected to voicemail. - Hi, you reached Rogelio. Andrea, I think I must be going. - What do you mean you're leaving? And, uh, what are you doing later? - I don't know. - Word around the campfire is that you get yourself a new squeeze. - You little bitches, let me guess, you and Richie. The ladies at the hairdresser. - Okay, so, how's it going with the new team? - What do you mean how is it going? It's going great, grand, to the top. - Mm-hm. Hm? - The truth? The truth is, I'm having trouble settling in. We can't come to an agreement on the car settings. I'm not getting along with the head engineer. And one of the head owners doesn't like me, but hey, it's the price we gotta pay, right? - Always looking for that adrenaline rush. It's in your nature, but with every decision we make comes a gain and loss. - What could I lose? - You know damn well what you could lose. - To the airport, please. - Well, Lupio, everything is ready for yet another race. The most heated item on the press this week was definitely the announcement of Rogelio Ramirez leaving Seman Baker for competitor Herdez/Quaker. Extra extra, indeed. I don't know what your opinion may be, but in my book, this is called treason. - I think he did the right thing. He's at that age where what you want is to get ahead. Herdez/Quaker is a notable international franchise. Probably Rogelio wants to be an international driver, and he's taken the natural steps towards that! - I disagree completely with you, Lupio. You just can't change horses in midstream, and that's what Roger has done here. Another thing worth mentioning is that his main rival on the track, Andres from Canel's, is now his teammate. - Yes, but remember, opportunity doesn't always knock when you want it to. It knocks and you have to take advantage. - Well, I don't agree with what he's doing. If he wanted to switch, he could've waited until the season ended. Let's hope things go well for him. Making his qualifying round is Freddy. Let's see how he does today. - I am pushing it to the limit, but I don't think it will hold. - Don't worry, we'll check it. Now bring it in, we're up in 10 minutes. Good qualifying round, 8.0, position 10, much better. - How did you feel out there? - Good, good. - You improved a lot from the first round to this one. We were at 16, now we're at 10. - Not so bad. - It's very good. But you still have to work on that little switch. Gotta step on it a little more, man. - All right, all right. - Have fun out there. - You got it. - Yeah. - Same to you. - Good luck. What's up? - Hey, man. Where did you get those, huh? They don't go with you. - Didn't your father say they were for the next champ? Freddy. - Okay, good luck. - Good luck, Freddy boy. - We're set, Roger. When the first yellow flag goes up, we pit. - Everything is ready and all the drivers are taking their place on the starting line. - That's right, we're all set and it looks like the crowd is aware of the rivalry between Roger and Asunsulo. This situation just keeps getting hotter. - Gentlemen, start your engines! - The Amozoc Speedway is at full capacity. It takes a lot of courage to drive on these cars. Let's not forget that these vehicles go to speeds up to 150 miles an hour, which makes it a high-risk sport. - The pace car has switched its turret off. - Lights off, we're going green! - The yellow flag is up. - Now it's green flag up. - Concentrate, green is almost up. - The crowd is getting riled up. The crowd is getting up on its feet! - Green, green, green, green, green, green! - Freddy Balbanera is in the pole position. - You got Roger on your six. Watch your back on the right side, right side. - Here we go. - Here I come, feelin' hot today, Freddy, huh? - Balbanera minds his lead but he's fightin' for it. - Tell him to move, I've got better pace than him. - Andres has the better pace, let him go. - Take it if you want to pass me. - We can see a duel forming with the cars from Canel's and Herdez/Quaker. - Where do you think you're goin', Andy? - It's no secret that these two have been at it for years and now here they are in the same team and fighting for the same position. - Tell him to move, damn it! - Roger's hanging in there. Steadily. - Inside, inside, don't slow down. Go, go, you're free to go. Go, go, go, you're free to go. Inside, inside, engage. Go, go, don't slow down. - Inside the car, go steady. - Laps are beginning to pile up, as this race grows closer and closer to its finish. A lot of hot steel and hot emotion out there, Lupio. - Okay, yellow flags. As soon as pits are open, come in. - A yellow flag and surely a lot of drivers will take advantage of this for a tire change. - How's the car, Roger? - Good, good. But it has a bit of a push. Come on, let's go. - Go, go, Rogelio's about to come out! - What's his problem? Tell him to get out of the way! - Back up, back up, back up! - He's blocking me. Have him move! - He's gone, let's go, let's go, let's go! - He's an imbecile, he blocked me. - Just go, forget it and go. - The Herdez/Quaker car was about to come out, but was blocked in by his own teammate, the Canel's car! This is unheard of! - I'm going after him. - Freddy is in first position. Andres will try to get him on the left. - Canel's on inside-left! - Copy that. - Behind him, we see Roger, fighting to regain his stolen position. He's coming in on the left, Andres is holding steady. - Our paths meet again. What the hell is wrong with you? - Let's see what happens between Roger, Freddy and Andres! - Get out of the way, you're blocking me! - It's under control, I'm going for the lead. - Roger's practically breathing down his neck! - It's not gonna be so easy. - Here I come. - Tremendous fight between Herdez and Quaker. - Alfonso, tell him he has to run for me! - It's all good now. We got everything under control. - It is the Herdez car that comes out on top! Roger's on the second spot and gets tapped by Andres! - What happened, I'm losing traction! - So much for teammates. - Andres Asunsulo is now in second place. - That's not fair! - Told you to get out of my way. - I've lost traction, he's ruined my race! - Meanwhile, Freddy is still in the top spot, followed by Andres, they're running out of road and the checkered flag is almost up. - Who'll get it, who'll get it? The checkered flag goes up for Freddy Balbanera! - I can't work like this! - Taking the top prize of the day! - First name Freddy, last name Balbanera. The driver from Xtreme takes the top spot. - That's my Freddy! - This unsportsman-like attitude is hurtful for our sport, and especially for our serial. Both of you know the rules. I'm afraid that on top of the fine for your teams, I will also be taking away 50 points from each of you. And next time, you're gone. You two have made a very bad mistake, because it could cost you the championship. - Are you happy? - I came in second, I could be happier. - You screwed my race. - Are you gonna be blaming everyone else for your losses? That's not in my contract. - Neither was racing with a sore loser. - Mm, you're right. I'm gonna talk to Harry. - You should offer him your apologies. - Look, you drive your races and I'll drive mine. We're here to win. No? - Decisions are just that. Decisions. They're not good, or bad. The thing is, learning to live with the consequences. It's like when you're gonna take a curve. You know you have to hit the brake, but you decide to speed up just a little bit more. Testing your limit. It's right there where championships are won or lost. - Hi, it's Julieta, I can't come to the phone right now but leave a message and I'll get back to you. - Hello, it's Andrea, please leave a message. - It was handling great in high gear, but was giving too much in low gear. I think next time I'll change your nozzles. Well, not yours, the car's. - You'll take care of it. Hi. - Hey, Andy! This is Vicky, from Virginia. - Hello. - How do you feel? - It could have gone better. - I'm telling you, the guy came in and blocked me. Isn't that right, Marco, otherwise I would've won! - Look, Roger, everything checks out. All I can do is take the motor out and see what happens. - With the points we lost, getting to the championship could get complicated. - No, don't worry, you did all right. Let me just suggest that next time, you come in first place. Hm? What happened? Races are not won with just motors. - That was a dirty trick, Harry, dirty trick. - Yes, it was, but you lost, so you buy lunch. - Yes, yes, but these aren't go-karts, you know? - I'll take the motor out, check it and let you know. - What, had a bad day? - No. I don't think so. - Well, that's the way it is, right? There are good days and there are bad days. - Did you lose your phone? - No, why? - It's just that, since you haven't returned my phone calls... - Should I? - I don't know, I just thought-- - What, that we had a good time? I think so, too. - No, that... That we would see each other again. - We are seeing each other, right? Look, Roger, just keep your head on winning, which is why I brought you. - Yes, we won, but I told you that this motor was finished. The rings are shot to shit. - Damn it. Can, can I race it? - Yes, of course. To deliver some pizzas, but you might get beaten. - Hey, fellas. How's it goin'? - We're okay, but I told Freddy that this motor's taking us nowhere. - We just won, didn't we? I give Freddy a chance, and he immediately wins the first race. So, less complaining and more working, okay? Okay? - Who is it? - What do you mean, who is it? It's your main man, daddy-o. - Didn't it open? - Good evening, I'm selling wigs of all sizes. Long ones, short ones, are you bald? - No, thank you. - Look at you sitting around, goofing off, my brother. While I'm working my butt off at the shop. By the way, you stood me up, jerk. Obviously, there's no woman in this house. You want something? Fine, then. I sat down and ran the numbers. All I need is the last race to be Rookie of the Year, Papa. I'd have to crash or fall asleep. - First you have to actually win a race, don't you? - Yeah. You're right. So, the Columbian model's here. She's in town to get it on. Let me use a room. - Look, man. I have had a very bad day. - Fine. I'll leave you alone. - Place your bets. - 400. - 400. Calls. Calls. - No, you're playing too rough. - Fifth card, the river. Bets? - Here go 500! - 500. - Too rich for my blood. - You pass. - You know, it's nice that you invited us this time, but you're taking it too far, Jimmy. - Sissy! - You play like you have no family. - Another sissy, and you, too! Place your bets. - I'll open with 400. - 500. - Let's see. - Calls. - Bunch of sissies. Sissy sissies. Oh, yeah? - Your bet, sir. - Let's start with 400 this time. - 500. - 500. - There's 500. - 500. - There's your 500. - 500. - How about another 800 more? - 800. - 500. - Bring it on, bring it on! - 38.08. - It's the car. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. There are two things here, the car, the driver. And the car is just fine. One-eighth of 100 is almost a second. The ambulance can go faster. What, did you want her to drive? Very good, Andres. Well done, Andy. I knew this was going to work out. Have you met Fernanda? And Mariana? Excellent! Now, that's a real driver. Not that piece of trash I chewed out. - What's up? And the gloves? - They don't fit me. - Where the hell is Jimmy, anybody seen him? What do we have? - Two pairs. - Three of a kind! - Having fun, no? Just remember this doesn't end, until one of us has nothing left to bet with, huh? - Put your money where your mouth is. Like the gringos say, "put your money where your mouth is." Deal. - We got Roger and Freddy fighting for third place while the Citizen car and the GMI car duke it out for the pole. Let's see if the kid from Xtreme can handle the pressure. - Place your bets. - $1,000. - True, this race is becoming really hot. - Calls. - Another 1,000. - 1,000. - He now tries to break right. - Raise. - He now tries to break left. He's practically breathing down Freddy's neck. - Fourth card. - Another 1,000. - The river. - Another grand. - This, this is a man's fight. Power versus strength, as we grow closer to the finish line, everybody ups the ante. - Pair of aces. - Three of a kind. I told you. This is not over yet. - Contact was made between cars seven and 15, sends the 87 car flying through the air! It's Freddy Balbanera! We sincerely hope that he's all right. - Freddy, Freddy, are you all right? - Well, the pace car intervenes, lighting its turret signaling that nobody can accelerate as the medical assistant unit makes their way out there. - Freddy. - The ambulance gets there in under five seconds, and this is the risk that comes with the sport. - We shall keep our viewers informed. - Remember, Jimmy, this doesn't end until one of us has nothing left to bet with. You even owe me the brake pads for these cars. - "And whoever lived and believed in me shall never die." It is with these words that we remember our friend, Alfredo, who has this left this plane of existence, and who is now at the side of the Lord. Let us remember our brother, Alfredo. - Are you all right? - Yes, I am. How about you? - I'm hanging in there. You really look great. Thank you for comin'. - How could I not? - In the name of the father, the son and the holy ghost. Let us go in peace. - It's not your fault, he knew it was dangerous. - You know what I love? That smooth space between your car and the other guy's at 175 miles an hour. That's where you're gambling-- - I don't think we are where we imagined ourselves to be. - I have a proposition for you. My team is looking for drivers. - We have to make a decision. - Let's see how it goes with those two who don't love you, who aren't your family. - I'm making a decision. - You've got all the cards on the table. - We are here to win. - The thing is learning to live with the consequences. - And the gloves? - They don't fit me. - They don't go with you. - Look, Roger, just keep your head on winning, which is why I brought you. - You were right, Jimmy. - You don't have to say anything. You're my son, aren't you? - Yeah. - He died doin' what we love. - It's a personal thing. All I want is to race in the Seman jumpsuit, and you come here to laugh at me because Jack and Harry don't want to let me out of my contract? - No, I'm not here to laugh at you, Roger. I'm here to tell you that I have spoken with the sponsors, and if you become champion they'll go wherever you wanna go. - If I become champion? Which means I have to beat Andres. - Exactly. - Anywhere? Europe? - It will be the first time that someone raced in one car while wearing the uniform of another, but if that's what you want, no problem. - Thank you. - Good luck. - We have waited a long year for this moment. This is it, the decisive moment, the stage is set. The speedway is jam-packed. We can look forward to an exciting championship race. - Roger is wearing the Seman Baker jumpsuit in honor of the late Freddy Balbanera. The championship sits between Rogelio Ramirez of Herdez/Quaker and Andres Asunsulo of Canel's. Whoever comes out on top for this race will be throned as champion. - Indeed and right now we have all the cars heating up tires on the track. Any minute now, we shall see the green flag. - Green, green, green. - Green flag, green flag! And the championship is underway! - Okay, Roger, remember that all we have to do is beat Andres, copy? - Copy that. - Just watch out for Richie out there. He's always after that Rookie title. - Climbing to the top spot is Ricardo Fernandez of Telmex, but he gets attacked on the left side by Germaine from FedEx. Running open, nose to nose, inch to inch. - Oh, please. - I'm going outside. - Let's see what Rogelio does. He's looking for an opening on the right. - Is it open? - It's yours, it's yours. - Got him. - Roger rockets to first place. - Very good, you got the lead. - This is the championship right here, ladies and gentlemen! - You have him in your sight, Andres. - He banks right, now he banks left. - Watch your RPMs. - He's crawling all over Roger! - What's your problem, damn it? - What are you doing? Wait till you're out of the curve! - I'm not gonna let this prick beat me! - What's up, Andy? We're here to win, no? - Will it be Andres or Roger? Will it be Herdez or Canel's? - I got you, I got you! - I'm keeping control here. - Roger's doing a great job of keeping his position. - Andres, no more than 6,000 RPMs. Don't ruin this championship! - Looks like something is happening to the Canel's car! - You blew the motor, damn it! - The Herdez car maintains its lead, but Canel keeps it tight. Looks like something happening to the Canel's car. - What's up, daddy-o, woo-hoo! Rookie of the Year, right here! - You still have to win the race. - What a race, what drama. Quite the spectacle on the speedway. It's Ricardo and now Roger, the rookie and the champ. - See you. - It's almost over and the crowd is on its feet. We're gonna see who the winner is! Checkered flag, checkered flag, checkered flag! Ricardo Fernandez wins the race and with his gathered points he earns the title of Rookie of the Year. Rogelio Ramirez will be crowned season champion. - What drama, ladies and gentlemen. What a race. Ricardo Fernandez has just asserted himself as Rookie of the Year while Roger Ramirez of Herdez/Quaker is crowned champion. Congratulation, Rogelio Ramirez, season champ! - Congrats to him. What an amazing race. - Let's go, this race is over. - Hey, what was that? - Just thinking of my best friend. Decisions have consequences. And yes, there are bigger moments, but those are the ones that show you what you have, what you want, and what you are.
