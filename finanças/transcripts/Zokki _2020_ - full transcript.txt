Every time I sniff soap, it takes me back... ...to my childhood. All who knew of that kidnapping have left this world. Therefore, it has become a secret known only to me now. "My Drum and I by Ryoko Maejima,Year 6" Grandpa, you're here? Yeah. "The Light of Despair by Ryoko Maejima,Year 5" "The Light of Despair by Ryoko Maejima,Year 5" Where are Dad and others? Are they still angry? Hey Ryoko. Anything you're keeping secret? They asked you to ask me, didn't they? It's not like I'm keeping it a secret... Milk. Marriage can't be explained easily. Well, we're... ...not married anymore. Lately, I've been thinking... If a living creature loses what it keeps secret, maybe it can't go on living. Huh? Once we... ...finish confessing... ...all our secrets... or rather... if we confessed all our secrets... ...would we die, I wonder? So Ryoko, take care of your secrets. Keep as many as you can. Alright. Breakfast time. So, Grandpa. Your secrets. How many have you got? 230. ZOKKI "Till you turn 30, life's a rehearsal" Excuse me... Could you close that more quietly? I've asked you before. Well, that was the last time. I'm going on a trip. So... I probably won't come back. A trip? With that? Yes. Whereabouts will you go? I've got nowhere to go, so I'll head south. Joy and despair. An endless cycle. You laugh,then cry. You look up, then down. The longer you live, that cycle gradually becomes shorter, until it all bleeds together. When that happens, what on earth will become of me? "Video Boys" You dropped this. Thanks. Impressive acceleration. Want a drink? What a way to travel, dude. Only taking a sleeping bag and a porn mag? So, I guess you... ...travel a lot like this? Well, pretty much. Where to this time? Kyoto. Where to for you? Just... ...west. South? Just west for now. Let's travel together for now. Well, okay. Mind if I look at that? Oh, sure. What are you traveling for? Just... Um... Not for self-discovery. I hate that. Adults looking for themselves. Well, sorry. I'm on a journey of self-discovery. This girl quit porn. So I hear. I was a fan of hers... So was I. Hey, sorry. I'll leave you here. Sorry. Bye! Quit saying that already. No! It's flat lined. Dead. Give up. No way, no way. Destiny my ass'. But, I guess it could work. So? How does he look? Oh, I guess I could go for that. That'll be 800 yen. It could work. Quit saying that. It's not gonna happen. It's flat lined. Dead. If it's done casually... It could work... It could work... After all, I'm on the road. The road of lust... It could work... Do it... I can't! Are you alright? Er... - Are you alright? - I'm fine. A fracture? N o... Fractures don't... ...hurt like this. There's nobody I like. Kyoko, you never tell us. But there really isn't. Does he go to our school? Tell me! Nobody, okay? There must be! Tell me! There isn't. Fujimura. What are you doing? Painting. How could everybody just go home like that? You really saved me.Thanks. I was bored, so... I'll get changed. You're a nice guy, Fujimura. I used to think you were scary. Kyoko's in hospital. Is she sick? She can't stop farting. Get outta here. Not long farts, just lots of short ones. Mixed with long ones, like Morse code? Do her farts stink? Who gives a crap? Maybe cute girls stink. Possible. It's possible. Totally possible. That turns me on. I'll jack off to that. You cum, you're a whack job. What if I get addicted to farts? Then smell your own. Jack off to my own farts? No freaking way. You stink... Kyoko, you stink! What's this? You're the smelliest! Kyoko! Kyoko, you stink! Here she comes! Don't! That's mean! Who said Kyoko's farts stink? It's not funny. She's holed up in the school infirmary. - Fujimura said it. - I did not'. You did.You said she shit herself and died instantly. I did not. You said it a lot. Seriously killer words. You got discharged? Congratulations. Thanks. "Lethal karate (kung fu)" They're good.Take some. Traveling solo? That's right. When I was young, I went to Hokkaido by motorbike. Oh, wow. Hit it off with a foreign girl at a youth hostel. We traveled and screwed a lot. - I'm envious. - I bet. So, where you from? Well... Do you know Sakamoto Town? Of course. It's the next town over. I only set off yesterday. Buddy, follow me. I'll feed you real good. - Really? - Yeah! Thank you. - Get up, asshole! - I'm sorry! Please forgive me! Hey! What the hell's going on? Hey! What's all this? Yasu! Who's he? A gigolo. A gigolo? Adachi's wife... You're sure,Adachi? You piece of puke! Adachi, that's enough! Tell me all about it. Come on, buddy. Get lost. What the... - Oh yeah! - Oh no! Hey! Adachi! Adachi! This is for Yasu. That too, that too! Here,Yasu. Ready, go! Yasu! Happy Birthday! You jackasses... What's this fancy shit? What'll you drink? Shochu. Congratulations. Have a seat. It's too early for cake. Yasu, how's your health lately? Got a checkup next week. Wednesday. Hiramatsu said his second son ain't coming back. I've been cutting back on booze. If it don't help, screw it. Screw what? Screw it. He'll graduate school and get a job there. Who will? Hiramatsu's... Shit... Forget that. At least for now... Damn right. Truth be told, I didn't say anything to you before, but I gotta hand it to that gigolo. He got it on with that dirty whore... - What did you say?! - You heard me. Come on, sit down. Buddy, you're quiet. Say something. Well, er... I've been wanting to say something, but I've got nothing to say, unlike all of you... So I thought of this. As you can see, I'm traveling aimlessly right now. Then again, I don't really need to, because I've lived aimlessly till now. Hear that? He's got nothing to say, but he blathered on. Oh, Sadao! Who's that? One of us.A fisherman. He was in prison though. He got out, huh... Yasu! I came to get my stuff, dammit. Your stuff's long gone. - You dumped it? - We suffered because of you! Let him go,Adachi. It's my birthday. Sadao.You made it back. Celebrate with me. Come on. "Happy Birthday." Come sit here. Hurry up. Okay, thanks. Got a place to sleep? Your wife and kids? Sadao. We broke up already. She visited me in prison. We had an argument. Ain't seen her since. But you regret that, don't you? It's too late now. Does she know you got out? - Where are... - Forget that jerk. Where are your wife and kids now? Sakamoto Town. Hey.That's your hometown, buddy. Oh, right. I guess it is. I can't just go see them now. Hey buddy. You mind passing on a message? Tell his wife that her husband deeply regrets what he did. What the hell? Well, you see, I don't know if I'll go back... Anytime's fine. Whenever you do go back. Okay... Sure.Whenever. Joy and despair. An endless cycle. It gradually becomes shorter, and bleeds together. Hey buddy. Take this. What is it? The address. Oh, the address. Give me a moment. I'm nearly done. Well, it probably won't be easy, but safe travels. Thank you. Sorry. It won't stop. Yasu, the step.The step. Leave the key under a rock. Got it. I will. Get some rest. So much for Yasu's checkup, huh? See ya. Thank you so much. "Mayumi Usuda" "Good morning" This is the third one this year. You were the last one to leave the classroom yesterday, Makita. I was... ...shoved into a locker. I couldn't... I told you I broke the glass, dammit. So I could rip a hole in my throat and die! Ban! If you're going to confess, do it honestly. Mr. Ono, Mr. Ono. Please come to the staffroom immediately. Wait here, you two. It wasn't broken when I got out of the locker. So maybe, somebody snuck in and did it... "I wanna die I wanna die" Makita. I hear your big sister's pretty. Compare her to a celebrity. Who's she like? Like Aya Matsuura, only a little uglier. Aya Matsuura, huh... She's even cuter these days, right? She's a pro. Compared to her, idols who get by acting amateurish are just goddamn lazy, if you ask me. I know. It's so immature, ain't it? Japanese society! Yeah! Giant Baba's crazy strong! - I know! - That karate chop of his... But his opponent won't stop. It's crazy dangerous! But Baba really knows how to sell a move too. This is me. - See you at school. - See ya. I'm gonna do it. I'm strong. I am, you know? - See ya. - Bye. At the end of my sophomore year, I finally made a friend. I'm pretty sure it was the same for Ban too. A Mongolian chop. - Baba's? - Baba's.The elbow angle... It's like this. About 150 degrees. 150 degrees?! "I wanna die" If you ask me, I'm against idols becoming women pro wrestlers. It's cowardly? Nah. I mean, they should make idols out of wrestlers. They're finally a couple. Finally. They sure are. Yeah. Let's go. Does your sister watch pro wrestling? Nah, not really. Damn, she doesn't? I wanna die! Ban was hated by both students and teachers. "Greetings (I wanna die)" And yet, having a friend to talk to at school made me immensely happy. Like what if, girls' tits weren't here, but on their shoulders.Then what? Then what? Well, there'd be more chance of bumping into them. Oh. But, if so, maybe... ...girls would just get better at dodging us. Good point.Tits would be even less touchable. "I wanna die" "I wanna die" Try asking your sister. Ask her what? What if her tits were on her shoulders? Nah, don't. Forget it. Damn right! I couldn't ask that. I'll ask her. For real, when I meet her. You'll ask her? "I wanna die" Don't watch women's wrestling? I do. Even Aja Kong's still a woman to me. She's shy of showing her armpits. Some women don't look like women. They all do. From a man's perspective. "I wanna die" "I wanna die" Not all men. You mean your sister? I couldn't write "Katsushika Hokusai." Katsushika Hokusai? I wrote the wrong character for "sai." - Basic mistake. - I messed up. Hey. Your sister's favorite celebrity? What's your sister's hairstyle? - Short. - For real?! Favorite food? Peaches. - Peaches. - Peaches, huh? I bet her sneezes are surprisingly loud. Yeah? Ban?! Ban! Why are you out here? Go inside! Makita... I can't go on. Why not? I can't get your big sister out of my head. But, hey, you've... ...never met her. That's right! So please! Let me meet your sister! Knock it off! Are you nuts?! Please! I told you many times! She goes to a college in Okayama! Yeah, so I'll go... You can't! Then at least... ...sell me her panties. Set whatever price you want! Sell me a pair! You're serious? Alright. Makita... Is 2,000 yen okay? You gotta... You gotta be kidding me. Huh? 50,000 yen. Make me pay it. I never... ...had a big sister. Somebody at school must've been bullshitting, and Ban happened to overhear it. However, inside Ban's head, my big sister came to life. Every day's fun since I met you,Makita. I can't tell him now. At some point, Ban stopped saying he wanted to die. Now my big sister has become his reason to live. Even so... It's no justification, but... I... ...didn't want to lose my only friend. Hell yeah! Thanks. I'm touched. My "big sister's" panties further inflamed Ban's passion... Ban! Follow me all you like. My sister isn't home'. At this rate, Ban will... or rather, I'll go to pieces. Ban! That idiot... Ban! Wait up, Ban! Ban! Let me... Huh? Let me see her! Your sister! Right now! That hurts! Let go! Bring her here now! Sister! Sister! Sister! Sister! Let go, dammit! What's come over you, Ban?! Ban! What?! Are you eating properly? Are you sleeping? If you keep this up, you're gonna die! Yeah... Yeah, I'll die alright! If I can't meet your sister... I'll die right here! You... ...piece of puke! Screw you... Why are you crying?! Shut up! My sister... My sister... ...died a week ago in a road accident! She was so beautiful. It was a photo of Honda, my biggest crush in junior high. Ban was... ...crying over my nonexistent sister. He shed the most pointless tears in the world. Or... maybe... ...the most beautiful tears in the world. Thanks for being honest with me. I'm... ...glad I fell in love with your sister. After graduation, I went on to a local college, and Ban got a job in a nearby prefecture. Then, just as we began to lose touch with each other... "Makita! I'm gonna date your sister!" He still wasn't over it... "Sent items: Ban" Honda! I'm hurting, Makita... She's got no mercy... Your sister! Not my sister. Honda, got it? Ban kept visiting Honda's workplace, to ask her out, and failed each time. Yeah, I got it, okay?Yeah. I gave her time and asked again on Sunday, but she said "Sorry." That's not fair! I told him I'd visit him, and he was thrilled. "I went on a date with your sister!" You're the best, Makita. There ain't nobody like you at my work. Enough already. Never mind me. My workmates are all old ladies! Excuse me, one cassis sour. So, what happened after? Huh? After what? Did she... turn you down again? Oh, Honda? Ms. Honda to you. Geez dude. You shoulda asked me before! Well, you know... She... as it two days ago? I asked her out like I always do, and she had the nerve to say okay. So, this time, I turned her down. I mean, she caught me by surprise. Hey, it doesn't matter. After all, I still like your sister. Are you brain dead?! Huh? My sister died ages ago. Honda's Honda! Well, but... No buts, dumbass! She "caught you by surprise"? Don't lie about your own feelings like that. Once you do that, you'll end up telling even bigger lies. Get up. Get up, dammit! Go see Honda now, and tell her you're grateful! Go! Go! One cassis sour... Just leave it. Less than a year later, Ban got married to Honda. Huh?You're that Makita he talked about?! Long time no see. Geez, you've met already? Yeah! In junior high. Right? I just remembered now too. Hey nephew! Let's take a photo! What a surprise! Yeah, it sure is. He told me about a "Makita" hundreds of times. He did? And you know, he always says, "I met you thanks to Makita." What does he mean? Well... What the hell? Er... He's... ...always tended to tell weird lies. Makita. I hear your big sister's pretty. That was quick. "Video I " Oh, good morning. "Good morning" Got it. Hey. A crab. A wee crab? Where'd you find a wee crab? Walking around. Well I'll be. Chilly, isn't it? Wow.The wee crab's angry. Tsunehiko? He's fast! Sorry... Hey! Come back here! Hey, stop right there! Come back, dammit! I couldn't help it! Couldn't help what?! Ow! I couldn't help it! Quit saying that! I said I couldn't help it because I really couldn't... You piece of puke! Kohta honey? "The Hiratas Kohta, Misako, and Masaru" Thinking back, I guess my dad wasn't working then. "Crab and Daddy" Oh come on... Where is it? Hey Daddy. Take me to that amusement park. Yeah. Take me! Okay, next next Sunday. You said that last time, and the time before! I'm the only one in my class who hasn't gone. Listen, Masaru. One day, you'll be able to brag about when you were poor. That makes no sense. Take me! Why do you want to go to that amusement park? Because it's fun! You haven't gone. How would you know? Because the kids who have gone said so. Come on.What's fun about going somewhere you know is fun? Huh? If you have fun somewhere you think is boring, that's much more fun. - Take me to the amusement park! - Ow ow ow! Cut it out! Cut it out! Oh! I found it. I found it. What key is that? Masaru, we leave tonight. Shouldn't we tell Mommy? Not if we get back before she does. Alright, get in. Okay? What? That's dangerous. Quit that, it's dangerous. Out you get. Let's go. This was your school? Yeah yeah yeah... We'll get caught! We'll be fine. Come on. Come on, hurry. Son, you got heavy. Daddy, what's that sound? - Hey! That'll do great! - Daddy! This is perfect! Alright! Daddy! Huh? Daddy, I'm scared... There it is. Shine your light here. Here, here. This one? Yes! It opened! Hey, what'll we do if someone comes? Good question... Okay, you go keep a look out over there. "Winning!" This smell takes me back. This chair's still here, huh... It stinks! "Mayumi Usuda" Daddy... I just saw a ghost... And I peed myself a little... Is it okay to steal this? I'm just borrowing it. Daddy, my underpants feel yucky. I'll return it after I'm done training. When you return it, I won't go with you. Oh yeah? That's cold. Blood! Blood? You're right! What happened? The ghost did it?! It's not my blood, it's yours! You're right! It hurts like hell! Ow! Damn, this hurts! Ow! Oh man... Wash my underpants too? Of course I will! It's embarrassing. There's a plastic bag in the car. Take them home in that. Huh? It's coming! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy? Daddy? Daddy... It's gone. Summer's hot, so it's muggy at night and hard to sleep. Then autumn comes before you know it. I'm glad the weather's nicer lately, but after all, it's sad when summer ends, don't you think? Thanks. You piece of puke! Trousers! Trousers! Underpants! Underpants! Masaru! Get in! Get in! Slowly... Hurry slowly! Hurry! Slowly... Hurry slowly! Daddy, your pants won't go in. They will if you push real hard! What's this naked lady DVD? Don't put that in! Brrr. What you want? Cocoa? I want coffee too. You're a big boy now. Geez, I'm freezing... Here. Let's get back in the car, Daddy. It smells too much of piss. Hey Daddy. Was that lady bad? Or good? Yeah, good question... It was good. Okay then. But... ...when I came to rescue you, how did you feel? What do you mean? Well... I felt glad. Hey Daddy. I should've chosen cocoa. Well, that's just the start of an endless cycle. Huh? What do you mean? Forget it. Great.This is perfect, ain't it? The bell has rung! Jab! Jab! It's one of the basics. So is this! Body! Elbow! Elbows are illegal. A week later, my dad left home with a woman who wasn't my mother. "Pussy" Hello, this is Ito... Now? Heading home from work. No, I haven't seen it. Huh? Say what? Huh? Why? It moved... "Pussy" "Mayumi Usuda" A funny thing happened I 0 years to the day my dad left. The bell has rung! Jab! Jab! Jab! It's one of the basics. A strong left! That's done some damage! Your hair's grown. How's it going? What? Married life. Ups and downs, you know? Ups and downs, but apart from petty stuff, it all evens out. Going well then? Going well. How's Honda? Good? She's good. Suddenly gets angry sometimes though. And you? Still ain't got nobody? Girls like Honda aren't easy to find. I've said this before, but I owe it all to you. You really think so? Damn right I do. If so, you better sell me her panties this time. Watch your mouth. A close friend shouldn't say such things. Well... It's an endless cycle. Huh? Masaru? Is that you? You're back. I'm back. Hey... I'm... ...sorry. I changed the photo to one of Maejima, my second favorite in junior high. That reminds me. Big sis, I'll be a dad again next month. You're pretty thoughtless too. How so? Come see me when it's not my sister's death day. Oh. Fair enough. Maejima? Maejima? It's me, Makita. I went to buy what Grandpa said he wanted to eat, then he said, "I'm going to karaoke, so forget it." He sounds healthy. Hey, you recognized me, but it's been so long. Since junior high graduation? Oh... But I knew right away... I wonder why. Maejima, will you stay here long? I heard you live in Tokyo. I'll be here for a while. Well, a lot happened... Oh. What about you? Married? I got asked that today already. Wow, it's really cold! - Back to my truck? - So Makita... Got any secrets? Secrets. Got any? I do. How many? One that I'll definitely take to my grave. That's kinda heavy. Even so, thanks to secrets carefully kept by people, the world still keeps turning... ...I guess. You think so? Sometimes. Wipe them with this. Wipe them. What's wrong? Nothing. Thanks. Shall we go?
