(Choir singing in Latin ) (Organ music playing) (Cars honking) ( Whistle tweets ) (Cars honking) (Cars honking, whistles tweeting ) (Cab horn honking) (Gunshot crackles) There! (Gunshots, screaming) (Child sobbing ) (Gunshots echo) ( Clamoring ) Oh, my god. (Gunshot) Woman: Oh, my god! Someone's shooting! (Gunfire continues) (All yelling) ( Gunfire crackles ) Man: At approximately 12:14 pm. Today, a sniper, utilizing a telescopic rifle opened fire on pedestrians. His first victim, Alfred p. Majors, was killed instantly when a .22-caliber bullet passed through his temple. 14 other citizens were mortally wounded. Due to the tie-up, police found it impossible to reach the scene of the homicides, and emergency vehicles were unable to get through. At 12:24 pm, the police helicopter patrol pinpointed the sniper as being perched on top of the water tower at the haskell publications building. (Sirens wailing) But, before appropriate action could be taken, one of our officers took the initiative of climbing the water tower in an effort to talk the sniper down. (Siren continues) - He say anything? - Um-mm. Hey, Pete, he's gonna come down. Listen, I'm not coming up to arrest you. I just wanna talk... Find out who you are, why you've done this. (Sirens wailing) ( Rifles cocking ) Pete! Get down here! Pete, the helicopter's on its way. They'll take care of it. Get outta there! We have plenty of time, none of us are going anywhere. I'm Peter Nicholas. Is there anybody you want us to call, notify you're up here? My name is Harold gorman. Do you want us to get in touch with your family? I don't care. I-I don't believe my son had anything to do with this. He was a very good student. I-I mean, he couldn't possibly have killed all those people at that distance. People have told me that it is physically impossible. Now, there might... There must have been a lot of people firing from those roofs, and the... and the police are... are covering that up. Th-they're... They're blaming my son. Nicholas: I grew up in a catholic boys' school in the Bronx, graduated DeWitt Clinton high school, a year at Fordham university before I joined the force. Where did you go to school, Harold? Why should you tell me all these things? I want you to know me. We don't kill people we know, do we, Harold? Only strangers. That's why I'm coming up, Harold, so you can see my face. (Helicopter blades whirring ) Hi... Hi. I'm... I'm 34 years old. How old are you, Harold? I'll be 22 the seventh of July. I'll never be 22, will I? Well... We can't bring anybody back to life, Harold. Nobody can. But there are a lot of people down there would like to know why you did this. You mad at somebody? It was a nice day. Nicholas: Yeah. You into drugs, Harold? I don't do that. I don't hang around with those kind of people. Can you tell me why you did this? Yes. You promise you won't tell anybody else? I can't... I can't promise that, Harold, you know. It's my job to find out. Well, I'll tell you anyway. God told me to. Don't! ( Screaming ) Peter, hey. ( Panting ) It's okay. What happened on that roof? - Nothing. - It's okay. It's somebody else's turn to play hero. I'm sorry. I'm not gonna pick on you today. I'm giving you a day off. (Laughs) Ahem, this is miss forster. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I took that class before. They let me live. All right. Okay, bye-bye. (Sighs) Forster: Again, Spanish Harlem. Forster: I really should have a police escort. I suppose the teacher I'm subbing for got mugged in the boys' lavatory. How'd you like to be mugged by a detective? Maybe they're holding her for ransom. Anything I could get for you? I have to get dressed. - Um-mm. - Mm-hmm. I don't understand how his aim could be so accurate. It was one of those old mail order rifles. The sights weren't even properly calibrated. Insane people seem to be graced with unexplainable powers. I read that. I'll bet you did. I wonder what guided his hand. ( Spits ) Are you gonna tell me all those people were meant to die? - Oh, come on, Peter. - (Water splashing ) You're acting like some kind of rookie who's never been through his kind of crap. You've heard every story in the book. I'm driving out to hempstead to see Martha. People don't change. It's really our decision, not hers. The laws of New York state have grown up. Anybody can get a divorce. I think she's ready to be reasonable. Martha: Why don't you try being honest with her? You really have her believing that I'm the one standing in your way. Doesn't she know that you sneak off to mass every morning... Like a thief? Does she know that you confess everything to the priest? (Chuckling) Hey... ( Softly ) Peter. I'm not out to hurt you, Peter. I feel sorry for you. You really believe. But where is all the joy it's supposed to put in your heart? I'll come again. We'll talk soon. Did you come here to ask me for something? You want everything to stay just as it is. That's fine with me. But... What will your girl do when she finds out? Aren't you afraid that she'll leave you? It happened before. Talk to me, Peter. Is there anything you need? No. No. I'm fine. No. (Choir singing in Latin ) Woman over pa: Dr. Morello, 361. Dr. Morello, 361. Hey, this isn't really in your jurisdiction. Guard: His wife said that he was sitting at home reading a magazine. He suddenly got up, went down to the supermarket, took a knife, and started stabbing people. John? Why did you do it? Take your time, John. I know you can hear me. Why did you attack all those people? Why did you pick up the knife? God told me to. ( Gasping ) John? John! - (Telephone ringing ) - Hello. Don't ask who I am or how I know. There's going to be another of those killings today. - Hey, who is this? - ( Distant phone ringing) Hold on a minute. Pete, get on the line. This is your specialty. Uh, excuse me, would you repeat that again, please? Look, he has willed it to be. Five more will die today along the route of the parade. The St. paddy's day parade? There'll be 5,000 dead-drunk, you mean. Let me take this. Uh, what do you mean, "he"? Uh, how does he will people to kill? You'll see. There'll be one of your own... a policeman. - Which one? - I don't know. Maybe he hasn't even been chosen yet, but it's going to happen. At what time? At what point in the parade? (Cars honking) Sam! Sam! Get down to the parade. I'm not supposed to march in the parade. Come on, there's gonna be a shooting. I'll be there in a minute. (Cars honking) Listen, get me sergeant duff, will ya? He's on the parade route, 44th street and 5th Avenue. Oh, he's there. He marches every year. Find him, will ya? Switch the call through to one of the cars. (Marching band playing ) Duff on phone: This is duff. Sarge, is there any way of delaying the parade? Duff: Stop the parade, sure. Somebody's about to go berserk and shoot some people in the march. It's gonna be a cop, probably a patrolman. Duff: Yeah, I hear you, but I don't believe it. Well, follow the march, will ya? Keep your eyes open. - It's gonna happen. - Duff: Yeah, yeah, okay. Probably up where the mayor's watching, in front of the TV cameras. Somebody's trying to terrorize the people in this city and they're gonna do it in a big way. (Marching band continues) We got a tip there's gonna be a shooting. Somebody in uniform, one of our guys. Follow the march. ( Indistinct police radio chatter) (Honks) Stop the parade? Rain or shine, that parade has gone on every year for 75 years. Something new is gonna be added this year. Look, it's too late, anyway. The march starts in three minutes. Pete, it's obviously a crank call. All that bullshit about being "chosen." Nicholas, stay here. The Irish have waited all year for this day. You are not gonna ruin it for them. You got that? (Door slams) (Marching band continues) (Bagpipes droning ) (Cars honking) (Choir singing) ( Whistle tweets ) (Bagpipe music continues) (Marching music playing) (Bagpipe music continues) (Gunshot) (People screaming ) (Music stops) (Car horns blaring) (Gunshot) - ( Overlapping shouting ) - ( Gunshot) (All shouting) (Gunshot) - How many dead? - I don't know... (Siren wailing) (Faintly) God told me to. God... told me to. We gotta get the parade moving. You rode in on the subway with patrolman Jennings, right? - Yeah, I did. - Did you see him, uh, talking to any strangers on the train? No, it was crowded. Everybody headed for the parade. But I did see him lean over. He was talking to a kid on the train there. How... how... what'd he look like? Well, he was in his 20s, blonde hair, thin build. Yeah, I rode gorman up to the roof. How did I know he had a rifle stashed in that package? Well, was there anyone else in the elevator with him? Yeah, I guess so. I take hundreds of people up and down every day. No, no, no, no, I mean, uh, a young man with... Shoulder-length hair... blond? People like that got no business in here. Look, they try to come in and use the toilets, they shoot up. We keep the toilets, all of them, locked. Did... did you happen to see a young man like that on the day gorman went up to the roof? Like I say, you don't see many of those. Yeah_j it was that day. But I can't, for the life of me, picture him. Did you see him the day of the murders? Was he in here talking to anybody, a stranger or someone? Yeah, hair down to his shoulders, like a girl, one of those hippie-types. You have always to watch them or they rip you off... Stealing from markets. I must have seen his face, but it's like he didn't have any. Did your son have many friends with long hair? Well, my boy, he didn't hang around those types. That's why I remember this one particular boy. Uh, how old was he? Was he about Harold's age? I only saw him through the window. My eyes are no good. His face was a blur. I couldn't focus my eyes on him. That's odd, isn't it? Did your son ever mention his name? Uh, yeah, I think it was... Phillips. Yeah, from uptown, Washington heights. You know, I knew he'd get my Harold into trouble. I mean, anybody who would walk barefooted around the streets of New York City had to have something wrong with him. Yeah, Bernard... Bernard Phillips. That's the name my son gave me. - Bernard Phillips. - Okay, okay. - Bernard Phillips. - Thank you very much. Nobody seems to be very specific when it comes to this boy. He was never drafted, never worked, never on welfare. Lived a charmed life. When you find him, ask him how he pulled it off, will ya? Maybe he was blessed. Never went to church, either. Yeah, no... No religious preference, I guess. Hey. You got all the blessings, who needs religion? Yeah. Check the school records? They don't exist. There are people like that. Ahem. Yeah? Who? Have you tried juvenile offenders? How 'bout where he was born? Start at the beginning. Nicholas: 22 broome street, little Italy, right? Maybe somebody's still left who knew him. (Voices overlapping ) (Calliope music playing) (Doorbell buzzes) Uh, Mrs. Phillips? Can I ask you some questions? (Door buzzes) (Woman screaming ) ( Screaming ) (Coughing) Nicholas: Say it! Come on, say it! (Sputtering ) Gah... guh... Say it! ( Groaning ) God... god... God... - Come on, say it! - Goh-hh! ( Gasping ) You look pretty bad yourself, lieutenant. Ah, I'm just numb. You won't believe this, this is the first time I've been hurt. You better stop by and get some stitches in that hand. Didn't even get hurt when I was a kid when I fell off my bike. Gonna have a nasty scar. Did you find out anything else? Uh, just there was a mistake in her identification card. What's that? Listed her as a Mrs. Phillips. So? She wasn't a missus anybody. She was a virgin. I've delivered 9,000 babies in my career. I truly could not tell whether that child was a male or female. It was as if... as if the sexual gender had not yet been determined. It was as if it were... As if it were being... Developed. ( Chuckles ) And you chose to call it a male? Well... I suppose I thought it was the best thing to do. The... the woman was not at all upset, you know, when I... when I broke the bad news to her. She didn't even seem surprised. And so, when she referred to the infant as a male, I just... I just went along with it. ( Sighs ) I wonder how that... How the child turned out. Yeah, male, female, or something else entirely. You felt no animosity towards your family? No, why should I? I wasn't even thinking about them. I was reading the sports page wondering what the jets were gonna do. When you had decided to get up, go to the closet, take the gun off the shelf, right? Well, it, uh, just occurred to me, yeah. - It just occurred to you? - Mm-hmm. It just occurred to you to shoot your wife? No, I shot Jerry first. Jerry was your son? Yes, he was seven. What did your wife do when she saw you shoot your son? Uh, she wanted to stop me, and then she ran. And then you shot her in the back. - Twice, I think. - And then your daughter. What's her name? My daughter? Lindsay. She... screamed and she ran into the bathroom. The bathroom is the only room in the house with a lock on it. I said to her, "Lindsay, open the door for daddy." I said it was "only a game." I told her that Jerry and mommy were all right. The gun was a toy. It was all in fun and if she came out, I'd let her play with it. I'd show her how to do the trick. Well, in a little while, I heard a laugh. Then I heard a click. She came out. She was laughing. I was laughing when I shot her. You don't feel any pity, do you? Any remorse? - I don't think I ever felt so good. - How come? Well... I... I thought I'd do something for him after all he's done for us. He's given us everything, and asks for so little. How could I refuse? Huh? How could I? I mean, he wouldn't ask me to do anything that wasn't right. They're with him now, and they must be very happy. You say he... He spoke to you? Inside me. He guided my hand. Do you know something? I didn't even have to aim. No, I... I know what you're thinking. You're thinking that he asked too much of me. But... you don't love god the way I do. - You're a religious man, then? - Not until today. It... it happened all at once. I've been searching for this all my life. What was it in the Bible? God asked Abraham to kill his son, Isaac. Sacrifices to your god are nothing new. Why are you looking at me as though I were the first? Life doesn't matter, not on this earth. Pete! Son of a bitch! You see this? This was your kid's. You blew the back of his head off, you stupid bastard! Easy. Take it easy, Pete. Take him out. Nicholas: Get him out, will ya? Get him out. He's a nut. They'll put that bastard in a home. He'll never serve a day behind bars. In five years, he'll be back out on the street. We've seen his type before, Pete, you and I both know that. But you, I've never seen you fly into a rage like that. You've gotta be careful. You might hurt somebody. - I heard you got hurt. - Yeah, yeah. - A lady invited me up. - Huh. Uh, you ever... You ever have a case where a crime was committed, and people say that god made them do it? ( Chuckles ) There's always some psycho around that says he's acting "in the name of the lord." You know, I had women claim that they were laid by the almighty? But, when you looked into it, you found it was her stepfather or their high school teacher or someone else in authority that slipped it to them. Huh. Girls have wonderful imaginations, Pete. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, my friend, Callahan, on the Jersey state police... God rest his soul... He had... he had a case like that back in '50, in the winter of '50 or '51. Uh, the dame said, "god did it." '51? 24 years ago? Yeah, I'm sure it was '51 because that was the year my eldest was confirmed. ( Chuckles ) There were a lot of elements in that case that couldn't be explained. So, they did the next best thing. They forgot about it. (Music, applause on TV) Sit down, I can't see through you. I don't mind having company, but I don't wanna miss my show. TV game host: Back with more "time is money!" All right, it's a commercial. Now, will you tell me about Mrs. Phillips? Huh? The night that you found her? Hell, if I'd been her husband, I would've beat the tar out of her. She was hysterical! I almost didn't take her into the car. Oh, not that I didn't play around from time to time, but... She didn't look seductive, you know what I mean? Shelooked like she'd been through hell. (Thunder rumbling) ( Rain pattering ) Let me in! Please, let me in! Here. Put this coat on. Well, what'd they do to you? Men like that ought to be hung up by the what's-its. It wasn't men. You don't know what you're talking about now. I'm gonna you to state police headquarters. You know, put this on you, please. Not that way! They're out there! There's nothing out there but the city dump and an old dirt road that ain't been used since before the war. Okay, okay! We won't go that way. I'll tell ya, lady, first police car I see, you're getting out. And don't get any ideas about accusing me or nothing. - It was as large as a house... - What? But it didn't set on the ground, it hovered. Huh? And they raised me up and I floated up into it. - What... - Then, they took all my clothing away, but they were very gentle, but I couldn't see them. Nothing, except a single light that blinded me. Sure, okay. What are you talking about? Where are we? Those are the lights of Jersey city over there, and then... well, where do you think we are? - They took me from nantucket island. - Huh? I was walking on the beach alone. I-I like to be alone sometimes. - ( Scoffs ) - It was a sound... a hum, overhead. And then I couldn't move. I couldn't do anything. I-I looked up, and it was over me like a heavy cloud, only it was very low. And then, it started coming down over me. I want to talk about it. Please, say something! I-I know I'm making you afraid, but talk to me! Uh, well, what else did they do, these people? They... they put me in the middle of this light... - This warm, glowing light. - ( Driver chuckles) - What time is it? - Oh, it's 10:34. It seemed so long. It was only a little after 10:00 when I went out for my walk. Wha... in nantucket? And half an hour later, you're in Jersey sound with your clothes off? Hey, come on, that's crap. Well, it mustn't have taken very long. Hey, did they look like us? I mean, they have no clothes on, too, huh? ( Chuckling ) They have, uh... I mean, did they, uh... Did they fool around some, huh? (Tires screeching ) Man: And that's the last I saw of her. Well, I figured I was lucky. She didn't cry rape. Right? Yeah. She was raped, all right. A child was born of that union. I checked the birth record. What're you talking about? Hey, listen, why don't you take the missus, go down to Miami, get yourself some rest? Look, I can prove it. I'm gonna find him. Stop talking, Nicholas. You're gonna screw yourself up good. Yeah, I know. (Rumbling) You've come to the wrong man, lieutenant. I'm not a police reporter. I'm a science editor. But you're interested in the outbreak of unpremeditated homicides, aren't you? Well, who isn't? So? So, in every one of these cases, the murderer has insisted that he committed the crime because god told them to do it. That's been kept quiet by the department. They don't want complications. Lieutenant, the religious editor is on the second floor. Religion, by its nature, indicates belief, faith of some kind. I'm talking about facts. Cold, hard facts. The kind you like. You've tried the others, haven't you? Nobody would print it? That's right. What makes you think I'd stick my neck out? Every priest and rabbi from staten island to yonkers would wanna hang me by my moustache for making them read sacrilege over their corn flakes. 'Cause you had the guts to print that stuff about god being an ancient astronaut. Now millions of books are being sold on this stuff... this subject. You got people to listen. Eh. What do you think would really happen if somebody actually believed that god was exercising his will directly over the city streets? I mean, good deeds, much less mass murders. Yeah, they'd be frightened, they'd be shocked. Maybe the killing will stop if it's been acknowledged. You're probably too young. When I was around when Orson welles told the people over CBS that the martians were in New Jersey, and believe me, the show was not that convincing, not that good. And you want me to tell them that god is at 57th street and Madison Avenue coaching snipers? (Presses humming loudly) You know, I'd like to see it. - All the atheists would love it. - What's that? God to show up. It'll finish the churches, all the churches. All my enemies would be out on their pious asses. Total chaos, that's what I like. Out of chaos comes reason. Out of reason, science. Crazy lieutenant, I'll write, they'll print. Don't expect headlines! Second section, the bottom of the page. And if anybody objects, we'll print more and bigger! That's journalism! His father was a motorman on the bmt. He, um... Developed Parkinson's disease or something. So, Peter became the sole supporter of his two brothers and two sisters. Um, stepbrothers and sisters, actually. He put both of the boys through college. They went instead of Peter. You know he was a foster child from the catholic children's home. Uh... The Nicholas family took him in when he was only a baby, so Peter felt he owed it to them. Where are they now? His adopted brothers? One's in California, and the other died in Korea. Any history of nervous disorders? Does he sleep well at night? Why don't you ask his wife? He hasn't spent a night with her in the past four years. He admits that. He goes to church a lot, doesn't he? I mean, not just on sundays. This is beginning to sound like an inquisition. I'm going home now, gentlemen. Now, listen, we just hoped you could make some sense out of all of this. I mean, uh... You know, people who are too goddamn religious make a lot of trouble for everybody. He truly believes, and that sets him apart. Religion can ruin a man. You'll see to that. (All shouting) Reporter: Police continue to follow the outbreak of religious violence that has spread across the city in the past week. Crowds, proclaiming the birth of a new god have attacked wantonly in mobs and without apparent motive. Psychiatric experts label the phenomenon a classic example of mass hysteria, but can offer no other explanation. (Sirens wailing, shouting continues) (Elevator bell rings) - Phew. - Man: Lieutenant. What the hell are you doing here? You know better than to come down here. Oh, come on, man, it's after 10:00. What you afraid of, the cleaning woman? ( Sighs ) Come on. Jesus Christ. Hey, man, look, I am very pissed, man. I mean, my bag man said that he made the delivery. But my people are still getting busted. It's the best I could do. The captain said he wanted some arrests, so I gave him a few. I've been trying to figure out a way to deal with you without anybody coming after me. Now with all this bullshit about god, I think I found myself a sucker. - ( Grunting ) - ( Screams ) ( Screams ) ( Gasps ) (Footsteps approaching ) (Faint gasping ) (Knife scraping ) ( Sighs ) This isn't like the others. Commissioner: Now you're gonna come up with new crackpot theories. It's not enough that you caused this, that you leaked it to the press, you made a panic from one end of the city to the other. The murderers always stayed with their victims. They never made an effort to escape. There was some other reason for Jordan's death. Somebody had it in for him. He was in business for himself. Now, what kind of an accusation is that to make about a dead officer? Jordan was working both sides of the street and you know it. Maybe the boys up in Harlem held him responsible for their recent problems. First it's god, then it isn't, huh? I'm just saying it should be looked into. Get off my back. (Faint music playing ) Nicholas: You're a pretty classy chick. What happened? Doesn't your man look out for you anymore? My man gave me this. He, um, used to be in business with the late lieutenant Jordan, wasn't he? How would a cop like you know that? Thought you was one of those honest ones. Uh... When I knew him, his, uh... His name was brown, Joe brown. He's been out of town for a while. How come? I don't know. Joe brown... Must be a million of 'em. What's his name this month? ( Chuckles ) Zero. 'Cause that's exactly what he gives us gals that work for him. Zero. (Faint honking) I'm convinced that the man who is in touch with us is everything that he claims to be. Yes, he's proven his control over any number of human beings. And he's always careful to inform us of his intentions before each of these atrocities. Unfortunately, one of us has betrayed his confidence to the police. I'm sure he knows who that person is. Why must he precipitate such a bloodbath? I mean, can't he communicate by any other media except violence? Man: Exactly. Why can't he perform miracles? Cure a few thousand people? Wouldn't that be more impressive? The only way the lord has ever successfully disciplined us has been through fear. Cure a man and you impress a few people who already believe anyway. Kill a multitude, and you can convince a nation. You ought to know that, Hirsch. It worked with the Egyptians. He killed off all their firstborn and then they let your people go, didn't they? I wonder if the cost of salvation isn't a bit high. Man #2: He's only made one request. There's a policeman... a detective, who seems to threaten him. He wishes us to convince this man to join us without doing him harm. Why would he be interested in a detective? (Car honking) My boss, Mr. Richards, wants to see you. Get in, please. (Engine starts) Richards: Thank you, John. Will you wait downstairs? Come in, won't you? - Why don't you leave him alone? - Who you talking about? - You know very well. - What does he do? Give you tips on the market? I'm surprised that you can be so light about this. You've seen him recently, then, huh? I've just come from him. Can't you feel his power still in me? He trusts you? Why? We were chosen. All of us. Without so much as a letter, not even a telephone call, we knew to gather in New York on the first of the month. He reached inside of our minds... Honored us by his choice. Oh... "Disciples," huh? He could've disposed of you just by willing it. Must've had a reason to keep me around. Perhaps he feels if he could convince a person like you... Don't tell me that he needs to build up his confidence. The last time the living god came forward on this earth, he's the one who got murdered. Did he ever mention his mother to you? Well, she's deceased, isn't she? Did he ever talk about a time back in 1951, she was walking on a beach at night in Cape Cod, and... found herself in a Meadow in New Jersey? I don't wanna hear any more of this. - What's the matter with you? - I don't feel very well. - What's wrong? - I... I don't feel very well. - Sit down - get my chauffeur. ( Groaning ) Get me a glass of water, please! (Groaning) - Here. - ( Gasping ) - Drink it slowly. - I can't. Can't swallow... Hold on. Take it easy. (Gagging, choking ) Come on, it's not your heart. It's not your heart! It's him! Come on, fight him! Fight him! He's trying to show me what he can do. Fight him! Fight him! Fight him! Fight him! Fight him! Damn you. Kill me. Kill me! (Token clinks) (Token clinks) (Train wheels screeching ) All right, police! Everybody, stand back. I was waiting for one of you to find me. I tried. I'm sorry... I tried. I'm really not very good at it. Wish I could pray. Logan, huh? That's your name? I-I warned you about the killings at the parade. He forgave me. He gave me one more chance. - He's waiting. - Let's go there, Mr. Logan. - I can't. Not now. - Why not? I can't tell him I failed. You won't have to. I'll tell him for you. Come on, let's go. Uh... He never comes upstairs. I always go down to the furnace room. He likes it there. It's warm, and, uh, no one sees him. He stays in hiding? Isolation. It isn't necessary for him to actually... Contact us directly anymore. He can make us know what he wishes... 'Cause he learned how. He's growing. He's changing every day, becoming more powerful. That's okay. You're strong. You've shown him... You could exercise your will. ( Screaming ) (Faint crackling ) You brought me to you and now you're afraid to let me see you? Why is it so important ibeheve? What makes me different from the others you killed? (Man whispering ) Accept me. No questions. Why are you afraid of me? You're afraid I'll find out something? You can't kill me, can you? Because I'm different, too. I'm starting to feel it. To find out. (Man whispering ) I told you that you could be hurt. Your stitches haven't yet healed. (Chanting echoes ) (Chanting continues) ( Crackling ) (Chanting continues) (Chanting continues) ( Nicholas screams) Sister, we're investigating a series of crimes and we need your help. Um, we need the adoption records for the year of 1941. We don't usually release that information. Oh, I know you don't, but it's very important for us to locate the natural parent of this child. Well... the child would be a grown man by now. Nicholas: Oh, yes. I don't see how it could do any harm, could it? Not at all. Now, those records are probably been moved to the new building. Uh, there's no record of the father's identity. The child was born out of wedlock. No, that's all right, we're more interested in the mother's name. Mullin... Elizabeth mullin. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hello. I phoned earlier. - About miss mullin. - Yes. You didn't tell her I was coming? There's no need to. She's not going anywhere. None of them are. Would you tell me something about her, please? Nurse: She's an old maid. You know the type? - I'll bring her down for you. - I'd rather see her upstairs, - if that's all right. - Sure, come on. Oh, listen, you know, we can't be responsible for the condition of the rooms. You know these people, they like things their own way. There's this lady who lived next door to her who died a couple of days ago. I mean, she just died sitting there looking out of the window. Nobody even missed her till dinnertime. Well, you know what they say... "There's only one cure for old age." It's second door to the right. I'll just knock on the door, if you don't mind. I'm sure you have something else to do. ( Knocks ) Miss mullin? ( Knocks ) Miss mullin? You have a visitor. May I come in? Mullin: Yes. (Door creaks) Come in. Shut the door before there's a draft. It's a hot day. You should open the window. If you don't mind, I'm satisfied with the temperature in here. What do you want? Do I know you? I'm a policeman. I hope you'll be able to help me with some information. Well, you've come to the wrong party. Well, this is about something that happened a long time ago... 35 years. My memory's all I have left. None of the other parts work very good anymore. Uh... You remember the New York world's fair? The original one in flushing meadows? Oh, yes. It was grand. My father helped build it. He was a construction worker. Helped build the perisphere. But you wouldn't remember that. You weren't even born then. Do you ever remember talking to a policeman before? About some problem... Officially, I mean. No. About the same time as the world's fair? You don't remember making a statement to some officers in queens county about a terrible experience you had? Why would you want to know about that? Well, let's just say I think it might be important. ( Scoffs ) They wouldn't believe me then. Why should you believe me now? They made me tell the story over and over again. All they did was laugh. Pretty soon, I began to believe it never happened. Few weeks later, I realized I was right. That was the first time my father ever hit me. They sent me to an aunt for a few months. Finally, I came back and... The baby was born in queens hospital. So, you... You were coming home after the fair. It was past 11:00 pm? I can tell more what I felt than what I saw. Mullin: There was motion and the soft sound of engines, and... I seemed to be floafing. ( Silent) It was a ball of light all around me. I... I felt it pass through me. And the purring sounds stopped. And I... I found myself wandering down the street near my home. It was the next day. Nobody believed me. And I realized I was going to have a baby and nothing could stop it. I swore to my father, in Jesus' name, that I never had slept with a man. Ineverhad. Ineverhave. Oh, you... You know miss Simmons down the hall? She never has either and she's almost 80. I guess we're the only two virgins left. I carried that baby inside me for nine months. I hated it. I couldn't understand. I even thought of committing suicide, but... We were... we were catholics, you know? Didn't the church help you? Yeah, they... They took the baby, and... They did put him up for adoption with a good catholic family. Yes. They did just that. Somebody at the hospital told me it was a boy. I never felt it was mine. It seemed to have a life of its own. I'm glad I didn't see it. Why have you waited all this time to come? Who are you really? You're him, aren't you? I don't know. I might be. What are you? I don't know any more than you do why they put me here. For what reason? What are you going to do to me now? Oh, please. Haven't you hurt me enough? I was never the same after what you did to me. Never. Please, don't... don't... Don't... don't... don't touch me. - Haven't you done enough? - I didn't do anything to you. Some other force wanted me born, wanted me to be carried by you, wanted me to... Wanted me to live half my life before knowing what I was. Why pick on me? Why me? I never hurt anyone in my whole life. - Why do you have to hurt me now? - Don't you see? What happened to you was over after I was born. What's happening to me is just beginning. You get out of here! Don't touch me! ( Sobbing ) Don't ever come back! What are you doing to her? - What did he do to you, ma'am? - ( Mullin stammering) Don't touch me. Don't touch... You're no cop! - Attendant: Calm down, ma'am... - I don't want anybody to touch me. I don't want anyone to touch me. I don't want you ever to touch me again! ( Sobbing ) Do you know who I am? I suppose you're Casey. Please, come in. He hasn't been home for three nights. I'm afraid. Peter isn't an ordinary man. He never has been. Why weren't there any children? I mean, he seems to have some sort of hang-up whenever I mention kids. I had three pregnancies. Each one ended in a miscarriage in the fifth or sixth month. Doctors could find nothing wrong with me. There was no reason for the miscarriages. No reason. None. ( Lighter clicks ) I didn't know about that. He never mentioned it. He wasn't sorry. Oh, he said all the right things. But I felt he was relieved when the babies weren't born. He was always frightened of having children. An irrational fear. It's crazy, but somehow I felt he knew they wouldn't be born. How would he know? The doctor convinced me... To have an operation so there wouldn't be any more pregnancies for my own well-being. Father dowling sancfionedit in the name of the church for health reasons. So... I'm alone. Sometimes I sit here and wonder, "who did I live with all those years?" I'm sorry, I have to go back to the city. What kind of a man would hope and believe that his children would be stillborn? Can you tell me, what kind of fear is that? ( Door opens ) (Door closes ) I was worried. I thought you might've come here. "Come home," you mean. No, that's all right, that's all right. No, I'm glad you're here. I've never seen the two of you together before. Odd, isn't it? The two people you love the most. Makes saying goodbye easier. See, he's going away. That's so, isn't it, Peter? Well, you don't have to keep these for me anymore. All my life, I felt so close to god. And it wasn't him after all. I wish I had saved some of that love for you. I wish I could do it now. Do you think you can set me free so easily? Martha... Help her if you can. Like you've always helped me. Casey: You came to her. Would you have come to me afterward? Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. You don't have to do this. You're going to get hurt. Casey, the choices aren't mine, they never were. Oh. Honey, you don't even know who I am. You won't let me get close. There's nothing left. Can't you see? Look at me. Look at me! Can't you see? Yes, I see. We're all just gonna let go of each other. Okay? Okay? Okay. (Car engine starts) (Jukebox music playing ) Corner two. Man: Hey, zero! Man, you got one of your customers waiting. Hey, man! I've been waiting for you for three hours! What you got there, huh? ( Chuckles ) What is this shit? - Turkey, you holding out on me? - No, man! - Huh? - Come on. Come on, empty your pockets. Inside out! How do I know you haven't got a tape some place, huh? Huh? Come on, man. What you pushing me for? - Come on, man. - Child, move! (Men shouting ) I dealt for you before, 20 times, man. I just gave you a hundred dollars! What's the matter with you, man? Look at this guy, man! Get in there! ( Shouting ) Dude pushing on me... What's the matter with you, zero? Come on, man. All right, drop your pants. Drop 'em! I ain't hidin' nothing, man. (Pool balls clattering ) (Music continues) (Raps) Zero: I'm gonna be good to you. Ahem. I'm gonna give you three bags. Man, I just gave you a hundred dollars. Inflation, brotha! Man, I can't go out there with this. They'll kill me. It's either them or me. Come on. Nicholas: Who killed lieutenant Jordan? Flush the shit down the toilet. Move! Don't be afraid. You crazy mother. Alone you gonna bust my ass? ( Clicks ) They ain't gonna let you do that to a brotha. Hah! ( Shouting ) Hey, wait a minute, man! ( Shouts ) ( Screams ) (Groaning) Phillips: We're not the same, you and me. (Door creaks) I found you by myself this time. You've tested yourself since we last met, and now you've experienced it. I'm not gonna do it again. In all living things, one set of genes is dominant. In me, all that is human became recessive. And you, my brother, if I may call you that, are the reverse. That is why it took you so much longer to come to realize what you are. That is why it's so difficult for you to break with the human portion of your character. Why did they put the both of us here? You were not like them, so they tried again. If there are others, they'll be like me. Your children would have been like me... If you hadn't willed them to die. I didn't! The history books are full of virgin births. Who were Moses and Jesus, really? Our ancestors. They were put here to create! I can bear your child. Together we could start a new species. No! No! It was meant to be. It's meant to be. ( Shrieking ) You've never felt pain. (Whimpering ) (Moaning) ( Gasping ) (Rumbling) ( Screaming ) (Rumbling) ( Crashing ) (Wood crackling ) (Car horns honking) Reporter: Mr. Nicholas... Can we ask you a couple of questions, please? Yes? Could you tell us, sir, when you went to the building that night, were you aware that you were gonna commit an act of homicide on a person named Bernard Phillips? Yes, yes, I was. Reporter: You were. Sir, sir? Can I just ask you... Your reasons for performing this atrocious murder against a 24-year-old boy? "God told me to." Reporter: Pardon? God told me to.
