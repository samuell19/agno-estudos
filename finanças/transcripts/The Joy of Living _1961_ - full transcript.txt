I speak to you in the name of the Motherland, in the name of our martyrs, of our glorious nation! Our home! Rome, the city of Saint Peter! And thousands more! Come on, hurry up, disembark! We don't want anyone left on the train! Be sure you take everything! Come, on, move it! Silence! No pushing! You two, always the last! Can you imagine, on the train, with flowers, a beautiful woman, tinted windows and a bunk? -Wouldn't you make that trip? -A trip? I'd go from Turin to Rome, 16 hours! From Palermo to Turín, 44 hours! Imagine... -Me? Trieste to Constantinople! -What's going on? Everyone to the walkway, one, two, one, two... One, two, one, two, One, two, quickly, come on! Let's move it! Don't be afraid, Come on, let's go! Without fear, one, two! Come on, straight on! One, two, one, two... No fear! I have a group pass. For 12. Come on! Two... Four... Six... Thank you, good morning! One, two,... Who are those people? Strikers! -Here are the recruits. -What? -The recruits! -Inside. See the leader of the guards. -I've brought you the recruits. -Good. -Come on. -Sir! Lieutenant, the others! They're my boys, they're orphans. Orphans? Good! -Come on, boys! -One moment. Boys, the moment has arrived. -I... -Come on, come on, come on! You're free! You're free! THE JOY OF LIVING Careful, the Lieutenant! To the left! -Good bye. -The train leaves in an hour. We'll see you at the station. -Have you seen the captain? -Who? The captain! At ease, you two, enough with the saluting! Captain, have you considered us? How so? You're the two who don't want to go back home. -Yes! -Yes! And are going to Rome to look for work. Yes, we thought that with your connections... If I had connections, I wouldn't be in the army! You're men now, you can figure it out for yourselves! You're free! Good luck. -I'm going to the station. -Thank you. Sleep, tomorrow I'll find you work. You've said the same thing for three nights! -Sleep! -How, with this hunger and those cats? -How about we eat one of those cats? -Don't talk nonsense! -How would we cook it? -I dunno! What have we come to? Eating cats! When you hit bottom, you eat cats so as not to do harm to the others. The others? What are you talking about? Nothing. Good night! Good night! We don't know who they are, what they do, what they're about! All that matters is that they pay 150 lire base pay plus wages and expenses! This could be a career! A career? -What do we do? -You see what's coming? Look! -Good morning. -Good morning. Two sandwiches! -How do you want yours? -Big! -Yeah, but with what? -Whatever they have! You're a free man, you should choose, decide, want! -Salami. -How original! One with salami, and the other, which is mine, with ham, mozzarella, anchovies and peppers! That's the sandwich of a free man! And two beers! Two beers to the table. -That guy spoke well -The big-headed one? Yes, stern look, clear eyes. That was a glass eye. -No way! -Yes! The left one. What are we supposed to do with that long list of printers? -You didn't learn anything! -I saw the 150 lire and I haven't noticed anything else. This is the list of all the printers in Rome, we're supposed to figure out who printed this. ''Our strength lies in our martyrs'', say the Black Shirts. ''Romans, let's help them! We'll hang them with their own guts!" Damn, we're the martyrs! And the Romans? 42? What's the plan? We'll go to each one and ask: ''Excuse me, did you print this? No, all we have to do is find the one with the defective "R". Look, all of them! See? A broken leg. See? It's not easy. You have a pencil? -Half of them each. -OK. -Do you have a map of Rome? -Yes. Fossati Printers? -Fossati? -Yes. -Fossati. -Fossati. Young man, what do you want? -Mr. Olinto Fossati? -Yes, what do you want? Some pamphlets for the agricultural cooperative Paludi Pontine. ''Agriculturalists, ploughing the earth with oxen will only reap ruin! Buy large tractors with modern agricultural motors". R, r, r. ''Buy the tractors through our organization." The President: Ferruccio Carrara''. Carrara. 50 thousand copies and a sample now. 50 thousand? Yes, we throw them out from a plane on all the biggest cities. Well I'll be a son of a bitch! One minute! R, r, r... Carrara! Sicko! It's working! But what...? -How did you do it? -I think I hit something... Now I can surely accept your order! -Let's get on it, boys! -Damn! -We don't have time, papa! -He's right, papa. True, dammit! With this problem we've fallen three days behind. We'll need 10 arms instead of 8. -At least the sample? -No. No... All right. -Your paper. -Thank you. -Your screws. -Thank you. Heh, how odd! Do you think that...? -No, it's not that. -No? -You'll need some tools. -Yes, of course! -Oh, no! -You're still there? -You should be ashamed! -Yes! Room and board? -Room and board? -Yes, and 12 lire per month. You shouldn't, papa, he's got a job! Just think, for Paludi Pontine. Don't worry about them, they're a bunch of thieves! Fine, if you say so. -Do you know the trade? -No. Then I'll show you. Come. Here are the accommodations. The bed. OK? Perfect! Only, you're not superstitious? -No. -Not afraid of the number 13? -13? -Lire. The only thing that brings me bad luck is the number 13. Fine, next time I'll ask you for 14. -Rosa! -Yes? Put another plate at the table! All right! Now that I've stolen his employee, it's best not to think of that order. Don't worry, they weren't going to pay you anyway. Come, come. -Good morning. -This is Ulysses, the apprentice. Yes, There is no dirtier trade! -There. -Hello. Hello. This is Franca, the youngest. I only had the molds for boys, but there was a fault in the press. This is Ulysses, the new apprentice. Have a seat! -What's wrong with you? -With me, nothing! Did something happen at school? What would you want to happen at school ? She's preparing a test of your good humor! -Imbecile! -Airplane, leave her. -Airplane? -Yes, Airplane. Because you served in the air force? No. No, I just can't stand impositions and I've rebelled regarding names. Since I'm in favor of progress I named him Airplane; I'm for the union of man: Universe. I fight for liberty: Massacre, alluding to the martyrs who died for our liberty. Put more. And I've already explained, your name is Ulysses, that's for something. At least it's not the name of a saint! That's enough for me. It's not enough, a man has a right to everything! Eat, eat! Thank you. And your daughter? Is it just Franca or did you add Locomotive? Her name isn't Franca, it's Francacontee Franchecontée, French province, the first to be conquered by the Independents. In what year? Shush you! - You don't know, eh? -No. -Eat, eat. -Thank you. -Have some. -No, I don't want any cheese. How are you going to eat spaghetti without cheese? You're hungry, aren't you? -No ma'am. -You're not hungry? Yes... but it's not just that. It's just that I'm happy here, very happy. Did you show the letter to your father? What letter? Scoundrels! It had to happen. A girl, they're afraid of a girl! I'm not a girl! Here. This is the proof! You know what I say? I'm happy about it! Better than leaving her alone at home all day. Yes. Do you mind? Will you let me read it? Now I'll need a suitcase. -Of course, no doubt! -The sales started yesterday! -OK, understood! -Lower it! And who is that? My new apprentice. Clearly you need a helper, lazy! That's my father. He lives... up there? Yes, for the last 14 years. And he never comes down, not even to eat? No, he prefers being alone. Besides, there's no stairs. -Is there any fish? -Don't worry, yes! -Fish? -Yes, it's his new thing It wasn't enough to have beef on Fridays now he wants fish on Thursdays! Yes, to drive the doctors crazy! -But you can't stand fish! -Ah, worse for me then! My, how he laughs, the cretin! Pay him no mind, he's a little... -I saw that! -Who gave him nuts? You little numbskull! Remember if there's a fool in this house, it's not me! I am the liberated one that you look up to, habitants of the sewer, repugnant worms!! And the wine? Where's the wine? The doctor said you can't have it! But it's obedience that makes me sick, not the wine! Bon apetit! Later I'll come up to wish you a good night. No, I don't want you to! -What should we do, should we check him? -Quiet, or he'll hear! He's nervous tonight, I don't know what's gotten into him. I don't think we should wait any longer. Hey, can you give us a hand? -Sure. -Yeah? Careful you don't fall. Quiet! -Who is it? I'm not home! HERE SINCE 9. JUNE 1907 LIVES A MAN COMPLETELY VOLUNTARILY FREE -I'm not here for anybody! -But it's me Franca, grandfather! Not for you either! But it was you who said that I should come up! -Me? -You don't remember? I asked you "Should I come up?" and you told me yes! I said you should? Well now I say... no! Tell him you brought wine. -No. -Yes! -No, no, I don't want to. -Yes, go on! Leave it to me! Listen! Grandfather, are you asleep? Me? I never sleep! Pardon me, I know that for you time doesn't matter, but... it's been more than six weeks! Help! Cannibals! Out! Get out you cowards! -Take it easy. -What do you have against filth? -It's part of nature! -So is water! Don't get near me! Don't you dare! Excuse me, this is so narrow! -Move that arm! -I was going to fall. Then fall, what do I care?! -Hey, can you come? -Yes. -Leave me, I'm a free man! -Free from what? -From being filthy? -And if I want to be filthy, so what? -Give me that, -Out, or I'll throw it! Stop! Throw that outside... -What is that? -His bomb. -A bomb? -It won't explode, it's missing the fuse. Yes, but if it falls on your foot... Come out of there! -You have it? -You want to wash my feet? No! Not the feet! -The pants... -There, over there... -It's boiling! -Take this. Leave me! Leave me! Not the socks! -What are you doing? -Easy, or I'll cut you. We need an electric shaver -Help! -Easy! Give me a piece of paper, one of those. But be still for a moment! All right, dammit! "LONG LIVE LIBERTY!" Don't you feel better clean? Slowly, I've got delicate skin! Friends, starting today we're one more. I'll let you hear from Olinto Fossati. Yes, my friends, my daughter, our little Franca, has turned 18 years of age, and is therefore considered by political policies to be an adult, and as such catalogued as a subversive element, socially dangerous, of the third grade. -Wonderful! -What a proud father! From now on, if need be, she'll go to jail with the rest of us! Long live Franca! Cheers! To celebrate this event, our young friend Franca has given us this flag, that she made herself! It's precious! A delicate job. How did she do it? It's Franca's secret. Look at the edging, -Black over black. -Beautiful! -But how will it be seen? -It's Franca's idea, -it won't be seen, only be. -Of course! -How did she do it? -I can show you the point. -We should fly it at the station! -Even higher! On the Dome over Rome! To celebrate our arrival! We shall do it and the flag of peace will fly high! Ours, the real peace, that will never be an armed peace! Bravo, bravo! And which of us will go put it up? Some news which has not been officially confirmed... It looks like they're coming to Rome in a few days... ...some partners charged with an important mission. I don't know their names, nor from which country they'll come. I only know that these friends count on us to lodge them, hide them, and help them in all ways with their difficult job. I've told them that we're prepared. Open up! We're closed! You can't come in! -We need a kilo of salami! -We need some pork sausage! Open up! Get out of here! Get out! Long live the king! Long live the Saboya Dynasty! Cowards! Urchins! Oh my God! What are you doing here? Well... -Don't bother trying to explain! -No, Franca, it's not what you think! Leave me alone! Help! -I promise you! -Let me be! Help! -There she is! -What did they do to you, my daughter? -Who was it? -These two. Yeah? And him? Well? -Why did you scream? -Let's go! We're wasting time! You didn't bring down mother? Always the same! Margarita! Margarita! She still doesn't come. She's disappeared! -Where were you? -One moment, Peppino,... An hour waiting on you! Don't get angry, please! The coast is clear, the spies have left, dressed for Sunday. For the barbarians, it's Monday! Come on boys, to work! Oh, professor! Franca, we need it now. Did you know that they've read our newsletter even in Bucharest? I've always said we need to be in touch with the foreigners. Has your daughter finished the drawing? She's almost done, she's finishing the coloring. And what are you doing here? I told you Mondays we're off. Yes, but for me it's no good having Mondays off. Well you'll have to get used to it. Now leave us in peace, ok? May I do something at the house? I'll shine the floors, if you'll let me. Whatever you want, but go. You know where the key is. Yes. Excuse me. -He always wants to work. -Who is that boy? He's my new apprentice. Is he reliable? Oh, yes. Yes, sure. What shall we put on page one? The visit of the generals? Yes. What do you think, professor? Am I bothering you? What do you want? -Nothing, I'm going to clean the floor. It's already clean! Are you sure? No, you see? There's a button here! What are you doing on all fours? Because since day one you've treated me like a dog! You can't deny that on the first day I had my reasons! Because of the grate, but you treat me like a dog only because I'm the apprentice and you're the boss's daughter. I thought the anarchists didn't recognize social differences. Not like the monarchists, like you! Me? Weren't you with those who attacked us the other night? No, I was with you all. Well, it's just that, I want to say... ''Well, it's just that, I want to say...'' Because if you were with us, who told you to come? And if not, what were you doing there? I can explain. I was taking a walk and all of a sudden I heard a noise... -You think I'm going to believe that? -No, I don't think so. Then confess! What do you mean confess? Don't start like that! How am I supposed to defend myself if I've done nothing wrong? You want to know the truth? I came to defend you, the dangerous subversive element! You believe that? -Not that either? -No! OK, if you think I'm a spy, a traitor, why don't you expose me to your family? First I wanted to see for myself. I don't think I believe that. You haven't denounced me because you're afraid they'll get rid of me. Enough, you want to tell me for whom you work? What do you mean for whom? For me! Or for the cooperative of Paludi Pontine? It doesn't even exist, I know! Franca! She knows... Franca! What do you want? I'm looking for Mr. Fossati for a job. -We're closed today. -Too bad, it was 50 thousand copies. -50 thousand? -Yes. Who's ordering it? The agricultural cooperative of Paludi Pontine. Leave it to me, I'll tell your father! No! -What are you doing here? -And you? I don't have time to explain, beat it! Wait a minute, we both signed on together, and I'm tired of telling lies and doing your job! What job? The pamphlets! Have you forgotten? They don't print them here. Come on, go! Hang on, and the 150 lire that you got? Fine, I'm overdrawn 150 lire, but scram! One minute, son, what's this all about? You know, you were right, Monday is the ideal day to take off! Excuse me! What did I tell you? Don't worry. He won't be back. Who is it? -No! -It's me, the apprentice. Get out! Did they send you to clean me up again? I've brought you something. is it useful or comfortable? Show me... because you know, I have no use for useful things! It's very comfortable! In what sense? An umbrella is useful, a parasol is comfortable; A handkerchief is useful but the finger is comfortable. -No! -What's the matter? No, I see! They've sent you to give me an enema! No, I told you it was comfortable! -But it's a rubber tube. -Exactly! Pay attention, watch closely. Here, drink, suck, suck. Take it up. Nothing? Suck a bit harder. Good? Okay, enough. Come on, that's good. No, not too much. Enough. Comfortable? It occurred to me the other day, when they wouldn't let you have any wine. Hey, what is your name? -Ulysses. -Ulysses, you're a friend! So I said to myself: every day I'll put the wine -under the trapdoor. -Good idea! Unfortunately I couldn't. Let me have another go! Why couldn't you? Mr. Fossati wants to kick me out. How dare he! And Miss Franca has grown to dislike me. I'll take care of Franca. It's no use, there's nothing that can be done. When I arrived, I told lies so they'd hire me. No... They'll fire me. You just have to come up with something! I do have a plan... but I'll need your help. I overheard that the central committee of the anarchist movement wants to send decided, tough, authentic activists -to Rome. -I've also heard that. Let's imagine for a moment that one of those very important people was introduced here pretending to be a simple apprentice. What a good idea, son! Everything will be fine, you'll see! You, a secret envoy. You told me to keep quiet, but you know how the elderly like to gossip, so don't worry, tomorrow they'll know everything. and you'll stay here. But you'll need to stop and see me -with the tube! -Of course! But in order to pass as an anarchist, you'll need to know some things, what do you know? Well... What is liberty? Liberty is, is... Not going to jail. You haven't a clue! Let's see! Birth of Bakunin? -Sportok, 1814. -Death? 1872, in Berna. -When did he come to Italy? -In 1861. And when did I meet him? That's not in the book. So you know, it was at the station in Naples, on the 9th of June, yes. He asked me: "Excuse me, when does the train to Salerno leave?" and I said: ''I don't know, ask the train conductor''. Later I found out it was Bakunin. You're a good student. I was always at the top at the orphanage. Do you believe... in the existence of God? Eh... Yes. Ah, that's rich! Why, should I not? It'd be better not to. Do you have a reason to believe? Yes, well, the world, nature... Why? You think creation is well designed? It's not so bad. And the orange, it's a refreshing fruit? but it only grows in the winter when nobody is hot! You think that's well designed? And the calves? We always get hit on this part, on the front, but the calves are in the back! What good do they do back there? You think that's good? Not the calves either, but... They're things that everyone should see for themselves... It's almost daylight. You know how to sing? Do you know how to sing? Death! To the bombs and the daggers! Death to them! We'll mince them! And we want liberty, and we want liberty! We'll tell them you come from Spain so review everything that happened there. Here you go: Barcelona, Madrid, San Sebastian... What an explosion! I've got it! What? Your battle name! You'll be called ''The Cemetery''. Cemetery... Cemetery? I'll be Cemetery! He's called "Ce-me-te-ry" -Yes! -No! It's unbelievable! But did he have a letter of credentials? With the seal of Barcelona. Barcelona? Do you have it there with you? He ate it in front of me, those were his orders. Well, if he ate it, then... I saw it! Pay attention, he's coming. -Good morning. -Good morning. Good morning. Excuse me for being late, I didn't sleep much last night. -Sit, sit! -You have insomnia? -No, I thought... -Give him a plate. Thank you. Two, please. Sit down, man, eat in peace! I can't, I have to go put away the types. -I'll go, don't worry. -No, no need. Delicious! Thanks! -I'll be out for a few hours. -Wait, at least a little something. -Very nice of you. -You're welcome. Oh! Excuse me, ma'am! -Don't worry about it, it's okay! -No. He seems to be a bit too young! Vaserio was in it at 20 years! Come on, hide over there! -Olinto Fossati? -Yes, -that's me. -Father! -Will you excuse me a moment? -Yes, yes. -Hey! Why didn't you come earlier? -I didn't have the uniform yet, and this is the last time I do you a favor like this! Come through. How can I help you? Well, we're making an investigation. Cemetery? -You know? -Yes. He appears harmless, but in reality he's trouble. His most-used pseudonym: ''The Cemetery''. So? No? No! Good for you, because anyone caught hiding or protecting him will have to answer to us! You've been advised! Listen... It's Cemetery! We know. So, weren't you scared? And you? Do you suffer from vertigo? Vertigo? Too bad grandpa isn't here to see this! He sees it, he asked me for the telescope. Like the good old times! Look! No doubt, he's important! I don't know. Let's change the discussion. Then, go! Get going! You signed up at the same time, yes or no? Yes, but I... There are two types of people that we can't stand: Traitors, and those that protect them. I understand, but I don't see how I'm to blame. Blame or not, I'm warning you, my dear, that this whole story could cost you dearly, my little puppy. I order you to tell me everything you know! I know a place where they're hiding dangerous anarchists. You? Yes, me. My friend told me. Why didn't you tell me this before? I was waiting... Waiting for what? For them to threaten you? Perhaps. I like threats. -Here, have some. -Thank you. -To your health! -Don't overdo it, take it easy. Cemetery... -Cemetery! -Yes? What do you have planned for tomorrow? Tomorrow? Yes, you were sent to get the generals, no? What generals? You didn't come here from Spain just to fly a flag, did you? Here they are: The French, the British, the Italian and the American. That's what you thought? No, it's not that, not that at all! Yes, the generals! You came to do away with all four! -Are you crazy? -What do you mean crazy? You told me, that's what you said! It's not true! It's not true! and even if it was, in this condition... -You'll be better tomorrow. -Yes, Rosa has a miraculous ointment. -Yes, you'll see. -No, don't insist. -You don't have to trust us.. -It's not a question of trust. Then, what? Very well, if I tell you more, -that means you'll assist me. -Yes. And given that the bombs are stored underground, it should be easier than flying a flag. -Do you have a map of Rome? -Yes. -And a pencil. -There, in the box. Here. You'll arrive at the station. From there, the rest will go on the National highway... Spanish Plaza , Corso Umberto, Popolo Plaza... Let's see... The first bomb here... another here and another... here. -To start. -Isn't that the Ravasholl method? Young lady, Ravasholl was an amateur! On March 11th in 1882, Ravasholl made a huge mistake! Bravo! Whereas the bombs we launch... -We? -We? What do you mean, "we"? You wanted to know... -Yes... -And you wanted to help me? -Of course! -Always with your curiosity! What good did it do you? Happy now? -Take it easy, Rosa. -Okay, Finally, a car bomb there and that's four plus two, six. It's not enough. Um, Cemetery... sorry to say so, but tomorrow we won't be there. -Why not? -No, no. We'll be in jail. Yes, in jail, unfortunately. After the attack it's possible. -No, not after. Before! -No, no, before. Every time something happens in Rome, like, for example, the visit of those generals, the police come to detain us. That's it! Yes, we're dangerous. They keep us in jail for a few days, then when it's over, they release us. -Yes, they release us. -You? The Fossatis? Yes, us and everyone else in the group. Four or five times a year. Sometimes more. Yes, this year we had Christian of Denmark, Constantine from Greece, the king of Bulgaria, and Prince Hirohito, from Japan. Japan. See? Our bags are at the door, always ready, because at any moment... You're expecting the police and you didn't tell me? -I... -And where shall I hide? I don't think there's any problem... Sure, for you lot it's fine! What time will the police be here? I don't know. The sergeant should be here. It's almost four. When he comes, we'll escape through the roof. -Through where? -Through the roof. -The roof? -Holy Virgin! Then we'll disappear in the night. Franca and I will spend the night at the station. Franca? Yes, a couple in the station go unnoticed. You'll sleep in the Forum with your wife. -In the Forum? -Yes. -On the floor? -The nights are warm now. And you three, boys... The bombs weren't enough, he wants us to sleep with the cats! And he's putting our daughter in the middle of it! They'll jail us for life, or shoot us! What's holding up the sergeant? If they were coming, they'd be here already. You see? They're not afraid of us any longer! -No... -As if I was so old! No, Olinto, no, no... Look at me! You think I can still be dangerous? Yes, my love, of course. If they're going to play it like that, they'll see what it means to leave Olinto Fossati free! -You'll see! -No, Olinto, don't do anything crazy! They won't be picking us up. Let's not waste time! To the roof! Let's go, Cemetery! Yes, we'll go. One moment! In these situations, there's only one rule: Don't lose your cool. Right. So, the first bomb here! -Don't lose your cool! -I understand, yes. Estefano! Always in the street like a beggar! If you don't talk to him, you being his father, I won't know what else to do! Estefano! Gabriela! Come here! Oh! These people are impossible! Go over there and tell them something! They haven't put you in jail yet? No,why? Does it bother you? Yes! Get your bags ready! You'd like to see us inside! - I'll make sure of it! -Well, what are you waiting for? Go call the police! You don't scare me! Go on, spy, run! Or better yet, call them on the phone, they'll get here quicker! Something else? I won't be a minute! Thanks, don't bother, it's not necessary! The sergeant! -Good day, ma'am. -Please, if you don't mind. I see you're all ready, eh? yes, always, sergeant and this time there is... -one more: the girl. -I know, I know. Congratulations. She's grown, sergeant, she's very beautiful. -Good day. -Good day. This time, they were at the point of just leaving you in peace. They were undecided, and at the last minute... What are we going to do? Franca, a glass for the sergeant. Thanks, please join me. Of course. -Cheers! -Cheers! No! If you're hiding someone, that changes everything! -Good morning, men! -Good morning. Welcome. I assure you that I was beginning to miss you, my beloved flock! -Miss us? -Yes. You aren't happy with the savages locked up in here? Speaking of savages, they've told me a new acquisition has arrived, a real cannibal! No! -Where is he? -But he's just a beginner, No exaggeration, Father, he's just become a supporter. Supporter? You call this a supporter? ''An unknown suspect planted the flag of anarchists above Rome''. Ah, there he is! Come, boy, let me see you. What's your name? Ulysses Cecconato, Reverend. But, an anarchist, and you almost ate my hand off! There's been a misunderstanding, Father. I'm not an anarchist. Let me out. What a comedian! I assure you, and believe me I know, that hand-kissing was like that of a seminary student! Very well, boy! We'll have a swell time while you're here. Do you like the magic lantern? He's been trying for 16 years and we've always passed on the magic lantern. But this time I have new plates, very interesting: the work of the missionaries all over the world. Leave it to us to think about the world, Reverend. My dear pretentious friends, remember that the only authentic bomb that has been launched is the Gospel. There's 15 minutes of water for those who wish to wash themselves. Hurry up! How she's grown! Hey buddy, you want to send a note to a girl outside? I don't know anyone. Maybe someone inside the prison? -Inside the prison? -Yes! -Among the women? -Yes! -Okay! -But it'll cost you! This is my hydropneumatic telegraph! I'll give you paper and a pencil. Who's it for? Fossati. Which Fossati? Franca. The little one! This is ready. Give it to me. We'll put it in here and into the pipes. Then pressure to move the water! Is this the one you started with the visit of Christian of Denmark? Yes, in February, yes! There's so little time at home. Soup! Your daughter must be quite bored here. It's her first time. Soup! We hope it's better than last time! -For me? -Open it up. ''Tomorrow the generals arrive at the station. I won't be there. -Who's to blame?'' -Can I respond? Come on, hurry up! It's already late, he'll have it tomorrow when they shower. Just bread for me. Is it fresh? It's hard! Fine, tomorrow I'll bring you Viennese bread. Though perhaps not. We'll see about it. Soup! Soup! ''I'm going to the mass for women, you go to the mass for the men. I'll be hiding in the confessional. It's very important! I will be waiting for you''. -Anyone going to mass? -Yes, me! He's up to something. Listen, I've been thinking all night. Don't you think we should tell him about the Wild Hole? -19. -19. -Franca? -Yes! You! ...in mulieribus y benedictus fructus ventris tui lesus. Santa María Mater Deus ora pronobis pecatoribus... This very important thing, what is it? But they didn't tell you anything? My father... Your father? No. What should he have told me? Come on, Franca. But they didn't tell you about the Wild Hole? -About what? -The Wild Hole! There's someone inside there! No! Opening a confessional is sacrilege! No! Ulysses Cecconato! To the visiting room! Your cousin. Your cousin. Go on. Franca! What are you doing here? -They got me out! -How? In the confessional there's a secret passway: the Wild Hole! Under the seat there's a hook. -A hook? -A hidden hook. Hidden. I've been so scared! There are rats this big! In the street, among the people, it made me nauseous! In the street? In which street? The street! That's... that's what I wanted to tell you. And you did all that for me? For Cemetery. So that he can go to get them. Get whom? The generals, at the station! Oh, yeah. Is there a problem, Cemetery? I was just thinking that they'll soon notice the escape and... They won't know anything until roll call at night. You have all day. It's a dumb idea, without preparation, just me, -it'd be crazy. -Why? Well, because... there needs to be at least two. Two. You have a mission to do, don't forget it. No, I'm sorry, but no. Do we tell him that there's a secret passage made by a comrade and that we've never used it? Absolutely absurd! Thumb up: we tell him; Thumb down: we tell him nothing. Agreed? Okay? -Yes, that's it. -Ready, go! So, two for yes and ten for no. So then it's no. Would someone have a clean shirt to lend me? And a jacket, a vest, some pants... To disguise myself a little in case they look for me. And a tie, please, and a tie clip. A tie? Sure, how about mine? -It's a bit sad. -And this one? -Yes, that's better. -You're going? And a little money. It's always necessary. -Yes, I'm going. -To where? To the Wild Hole. -Huh! -How? Luckily, I have my informers. I promise you, Ulysses, I was just asking our friends here... -But, what informers? -Your shoes, quickly! -Of course! -What did I tell you? -Is he going to...? -Sure, didn't you hear? And the money? Thank you, thank you... I'm poor, I'm an artist... Very good. Thank you. Is that all you have, professor? -Yes, yes... -Excuse me, professor. Hey, professor! He forgot about this! -Thanks. -That's it. Here. 100 lire? Father! I don't have change. And now you'll have to help me get back into the chapel. How do we do that? Tell us how we're going to do that. You've gotten this sudden urge to enjoy watching the magic lantern. The magic lantern? They'll count us at the door. Yes, they'll notice someone missing when we return. Come here. 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 15. Father Ignacio? Are you there, Father? Go ahead. -Father, I need to confess! -It's ok, come back later. You have to help me, Father! It's a huge sin! -Try to give it to me quickly. -It's just that I don't dare! Do this: Shut your eyes, open your mouth, and do it! Do you promise you'll absolve me? No, that's not how it's done! First you tell, then we'll see! Father...! Hurry up, the Lord is busy... Don't cry, please, don't cry! If you cry, the sins get worse, and yours is already pretty bad! Are you going to tell me or not? I can't! I can't! Yes or no? Yes, I did it, but... I don't have the courage to tell you about it! -Mother! -What happened? I've seen... I've seen the flames of Hell! Enough! Don't go crazy on me too! You startled me! -Startled? You? -It's an expression. Light it... very good. Wait, I'll go ahead. -Come on. -Give me your hand. Franca! Let's be frank... My name is Ulysses Cecconato. Nothing more. -I'm sorry for deceiving you. -You don't want me to go with you! You don't trust me! Or are you afraid for me? -I'll go back to the prison. -But if you go back... what will I do out here alone? Cemetery, you're marvelous! Fine! Let's go! I'll be marvelous, but you asked for it! Yes, yes Cemetery! I asked for it! Yes! Our canoe is crossing a river infested with alligators. It's not that the missionary wants to baptize the alligators, but if one of those vermin eats one of the black brothers that has been baptized, he'll go straight to heaven and the alligator gets nothing. Yeah... Go, go! He's back! From the coconut, our missionaries have shown the natives how to extract the butter, increasing their standard of living. See how he puts the butter on his head? This mass helps this black: what a radiant expression! -Some people call that a "smile''. -Change. This is an adult giraffe. At it's feet you see the baby giraffes. Observe its long neck. This is a cathedral. It has been constructed, but the slide of it hasn't yet arrived. -Franca has disappeared! -How is that possible? -She went to mass this morning. -To mass? -Her too? -They escaped together! So it was her that told him about the Wild Hole! Is something happening back there? -No, nothing, they're interested is all. -Next! We have to do something! I suppose we have to go look for her. -And soon! -What's going on? His daughter escaped with Cemetery! She escaped with a man, let's be clear! -Come on, let's go! -But we can't just go like that! I'll pull her back by the ears, even if I have to drag her! -And if they catch us? -We'll do it quickly. Keep him occupied for as long as you can. Let's go. This is some irrigation work, very important, which you can't really see because it's all flat, but the work is really impressive, according to the Father Superior. Did you hear the salute of honor? They've arrived. What now? Now Cemetery will think. Sorry, I'm bothering you. Would the right-hand aide of Cemetery -care for a refreshment? -No, thank you, Cemetery. This place is so full of people! The best hide-out is always within the masses. Who would suspect two swimmers are planning an attack? -That's true. -You know how to swim? -Yes. -Good, let's go! "PUT THE MILK ON THE TABLE" Milk? Nitroglycerine! I hope they're not trying to tell us our job! We'll put things where we see fit Add half a cup of milk! The Principles of Gastronomy. [Speaking in Russian] Nobody's here! [Speaking in Russian] They are real bombs! The Arch of Constantine. -How can I help you? -Something small and round. -Like what? -I don't know, something... -This? -Too small. -How about this? -Too big. Don't you have anything medium-sized? Here this cauliflower is perfect! Here. Get rid of the leaves. No, make it into a nice little package... with twine. Thank you. -There it is! -Yes? It's better you carry it, a woman is more natural. Take it. -Isn't it a bit light? -Just a kilo and a half of Tritol. Cemetery... Call me Ulysses. It's more prudent. I didn't know -that the grocer was one of us. -No, he knows nothing! They left him a package and he just gave it to me. Ah, I see! And do you know who left me the package? No. He was once at your house, you remember the dark boy? -The one with the pamphlets! -He's my secret agent. No, it's not this, it's still noon. Come, don't be afraid, I'm here, don't be afraid. Take it easy. -Where are we going now? -Where to now? -Yes. -To work! -Yes? -Come on. -We'll find her. -Yes, but in what condition? How dirty! Look how they left everything! They don't respect anything! Poor mother, if she saw this floor! Franca! Franca! Franca! Don't you dare touch it! -They're not here! -Nobody's here! -It looks serious. -How many are missing? No doubt, they're doing it! Oh, my god! Franca is just a child! She has no right to bomb things without my authorization! Don't touch it I said! Still! Keep still! Grandfather! What do you want? What do you want? Go! A bomb is going to go off! Not here! A daughter and a grandfather all in one go! What do we do now? Oh god! We've wasted too much time, we have to get back before they finish the slides. What about Franca? And what does this show? It shows more or less the same thing, more or less. We've already seen this one. I'm going to talk to the barber. No, dad, wait a moment! No, dad! Let me go! I've made up my mind! Enough! Don't move! Mr. Gorgolano, Mr. Gorgolano! Put a hot vinegar mixture on his head. I'm speaking to you! -Careful! -Hold on! Ma'am, we're speaking. Don't touch me again! Mr. Gorgolano, have you seen my daughter? Your daughter? Isn't she in the jail? No, I'm looking for her. -If you see her... -Why would I see her? Because she'll pass by here, I'm sure of it. Be still! And our grandfather? You haven't seen him either? Him too? This is not the lost-and-found. Excuse me, ma'am. Be still, he's almost finished. I'm under the impression that you've gotten the gist of what the missions are all about. Lights. Lights! Right, what was I saying? I was right. I've never had a more attentive audience! Count them, there should be fifteen! -Director! -Mr. Capellan, something very serious is happening here! There should be four missing... the four Fossatis. -My four friends the Fossatis? -It's impossible that they are here, they were seen in the city today. Director, I can't allow you to say something like that, look! -Who called? -Giuseppe Gorgolano, surely a false name. No, no no! Giuseppe Gorgolano, Lovatelli Square! Gorgolano. Find him! Insults to the magistrate will be severely punished! Director, I found this ball coming out of the fountain! It's so wonderful to be with you! It's so peaceful, as if nothing is going to happen. Who knows? Nothing might happen after all. My dear Franca... one has to learn to appreciate these times of peace. We're here between two parentheses, let's close them... so that nobody can come inside. If I was rich, I'd buy lots of parentheses, all made of gold, to live inside, with you. -You speak like a poet. -I am a poet, I've been one since I understood that what matters is action. Action, of course. -What's wrong? -A worm, in the bomb! -Waiter! -Don't touch it. -Take away this filth! -Excuse me, sir? If I wanted to eat worms, I'd go to China! You don't know how sorry we are, a thousand pardons, sir. -It's fine. -Shall I take this away? Leave it! Don't touch it! I'd like fruit and coffee, and the bill. Sometimes a little foolishness about nothing makes me furious, like my father. -Your father? -Yes, he was a marvelous man, two meters in height, stronger than a bull, eyes of a lynx, his name was Volcano. And his nickname, who gave it to him? Excuse me. A Mexican, named Soledad. Italian Daily! After the infernal attack on Santa Barbara in the Caribbean, she lured the police to herself to save me. And they killed her. Oh, Soledad! -Italian Daily? -No, thank you. What a beautiful gesture! Yes, of course, very beautiful. -She was a heroine. -How I envy her. -Franca, you're marvelous. -Me? No... Yes, I think so. What a shame... Why? Too bad that I'm not Cemetery. -Again with that. -I mean, that I'm not the Cemetery that you imagined. You know I've never gotten used to bombing places? It's still difficult? Yes, almost always. Perhaps it's the memory of her, of Soledad. Soledad? Yes, of course... I had forgotten her. You're a bad liar, but no matter, better to believe you. -Wait for me here. -I want to go too. -No, you've done enough! -No, I still haven't done anything! Franca! Come here! Excuse me! Excuse me! Franca! Oh my god! The Arch of Constantine! No, but nobody was underneath! But it's the Arch of Constantine! What will they say!?! Is it important? -They'll register the whole city! -We need to save ourselves! -But where? -In the jail! Don't come back in, things are getting messy. That's why we want back in! No, wait! You can't! You can't! They've found everything! The director found a ball with a note from your mother saying she escaped with you! And then the Arch of Constantine! What were you thinking? Are you crazy? The professor almost fainted! He always says never to touch the Arch of Constantine! -I'll explain everything! -What's there to explain? You're public knowledge! Didn't you see? If you come back, you lose! -We're safe now. -Hurry! -Let's go! -To where? -To England! -Why? It's a paradise for fugitives. -You should know better than I! -Yes, of course! Go home. In the first drawer of my chest there's a little box. There's some jewelry from my grandmother, we'll sell them. Meanwhile I'll go to the cleaners and pick up my dress. -To go to England? -Yes! In one hour at the Trevi Fountain. -Who is it? -It's me. -Who, Ulysses? -Yes, grandfather. -Come up, I have something to tell you! -No... It's very important, come up! Grandfather, would you have any money? -No. What for? -And a fake beard? -A false beard? -No, but wait, -speaking of beards... -Fine, good day! -And what is this? -They're bombs! The real agents have come! I'm trying to tell you but you won't let me speak! The Arch of Constantine! It was them... One moment! -Did you see them close-up? -In the flesh! If they are the ones who really placed the bombs, we're saved! You were right! -What are they? -They're bombs! You've done a good job, comrade. They're back! Two men are coming up the stairs. Come on, hide! Quickly! Nobody make a move until I give the order! It's them! -Now they'll bomb the Coliseum. -Why the Coliseum? They've already blown up the Arch of Constantine. No! No! What a shame! You, too? To think I had my first kiss under that arch. They're going to the Peace Fair! No, they're not going anywhere! The others will get them! -Very good! -Why didn't we get them? Let them launch their bombs, let them burn everything! At 5:30, at the Peace Fair! Seven bombs! Aren't we the party of order? To re-establish order, what do we need? Disorder! -Magnificent! -We have to do it right because they're working for us. -What genius! -To the Peace Fair! What's happening? -I have to go, too. -No! What can you do? I forbid you! Don't you understand that if someone dies it will be my fault? I'll stop it for sure! -Who? You, Ulysses? -Yes, I'll do it! But then they'll know that you're not Cemetery! -Good! -It'll fall on me too! Oh, my dignity! -Keep the change. -Thank you. It's full of police. They'll have photos of us. Don't worry, let me handle it. Give me one of those bombs to start and make sure you don't move from here. It's not a prison, it's a come-and-go! says the head of the guard. You're only making it worse! Whatever happens, remember that I love you. Me too. -Whatever happens. -Whatever happens. Very good. Give it to him. YESTERDAY, BOMBS TOMORROW, MAIL We will no longer pave the new consular streets with stones, but with helmets. -We're squashing the enemy! -And the tar that covers them we boil in the old camp kitchens. If you'd like to follow me. And this observation balloon... Quiet, children! science has found that the Whooping Cough can be cured with high-altitude flights. Miss, please bring forward the smallest. Come, precious, give the man a kiss. -I've already had it. -You can have it twice. Give them the flowers. -I know everything! -Ulysses, try to understand me! Let me explain! Too late. See those two with the beards? -Yes. -I work with them. Okay, let's split up. You go after that one and protect him and I'll protect the other, and every time he places a bomb, you tell me where he has put it. -Yes, yes, perfect. -Go! Good morning, sir, how may I help you? -This stroller. -Don't touch it, please. -You like this stroller? -Yes. There are other kinds. This is for twins. -No, I want this one! -Look how roomy it is! No! Yeah, I see it, I see it! From war to peace, ladies and gentlemen! Our pasta-cutting wheel is nothing more than a spur from the Glorious Saboya Cavalry, a useful object for every family and a must-have memento for every patriot! You can cook any meal or food in 5 minutes, thanks to our hermetically-sealed casserole dish! As you see, it's very simple! Just turn the dial and the casserole is ready! -Perfect! -There's no danger of it exploding? Impossible, sir, thanks to our automatic mechanism. It's very simple, just put it over heat and in five minutes the soup is ready! Good bye, sir, thank you. ... from the Saboya Cavalry, an object useful for any family, -a memento for our patriots! -...in five minutes, Voila! -Excuse me. I want that casserole. -They're all the same! No, no. That one has a bigger safety mechanism. Yes, they're all the same! -I want that one! -You want that one? -Very well, there you are. -How much do I owe you? Ten lire, sir. Thank you very much. Thank you. And two. Move it! -This coin is worthless now. -Since when? Since a long time. Don't you see it has Humberto The First? -So what? -He's dead. I know that, Bresso killed him! -Where'd you get it? -Doesn't matter, I want in! It doesn't matter if you understand. -I want a ticket! -Give it to him, I'll pay for it. It's gold! Grandfather! Grandfather! Ma'am! Ma'am! -Who, me? -Yes, you! -What do you have in the bag? -In the bag? Open it, if you would. -Melons. -Melons! You should have said so. Take it, excuse us. -Melons... -Go on, please... Ulysses!! Take those bombs back right now! I won't take back anything! I'm stopping a massacre! You don't see those two? Leave me, grandfather! Ulysses, if you do it I'll tell Franca everything. I've spent all day trying to convince her that Cemetery doesn't exist, but it's no use. She's crazy about him! Tell me. Yours should have three. Yes, he's placed them. He put one here in the cuckoo... He's not a traitor, he's a monster! -That's it, a monster! -No, a traitor! Yeah, a traitor! And me like an idiot behind him loaded with melons -What do you mean, melons? -Yes, melons! All the bombs have been paced! When they explode, out with your jackets! We'll help the wounded with our black jackets on! -Give it to me, I'll push it. -No! Why didn't you obey me? I told you to wait outside! But are you sure? Definitely. That's the couple we're looking for. Okay, agreed, let's get them. One moment, excuse us. Please, just a few questions, perhaps a bit indiscreet. Are you two married? -No, married, no. -Engaged? -Yes, obviously. -Very good. The generals are coming this way. Come. -Paris, Amsterdam... -Paris... Excuse me, do you think you finished your job? You have to do it again! Move it! Ladies and gentlemen, we've come to what one can call the heart of our exposition: the first prefabricated house, the House of Peace! A symbol and promise of a future finally peaceful and happy! We are giving it to this couple who are eligible to represent... See what you've done? ... honored to offer to this symbolic couple... -You're mad! -And you're despicable! ...a future happiness! I hate you, I detest you! I'll kill you! And now they're giving you a house! Satisfied? I don't care, I won't die. ...the key to this house, that will be for you... -Let me finish... -Yes. ... that will be for you, the House of Peace, in this changing world and... Shit! ... shit! Excuse me. The house is yours! I don't know. Tell the governor... -Where is he? -In the house of peace. -What are you doing, son? -Nothing. I assure you... It's the first time I've ever owned a house and I want to see all of it. -It's quite clean. -Excuse me? -It's quite clean. -Let me, it will good for all of you. Excuse me. Excuse me. It would be a scandal! Keep your eyes open! Excuse me! It's 5:25! -We're agreed. -Pardon me! Excuse me, let me look down here. Excuse me, Your Excellence. -Yes, my son? -Can you tell me the exact time? -I think so. -Thank you. -Yes, it's 5:30. -No, it must be running ahead. -Now you should say something. -Yes, I'll be brief. In this house are seven bombs that will explode in three minutes! Out! Out! Move it! Out! Run everyone, everyone out! This is going to explode! Cut it! Cut it! No!!! Poor thing! Don't be frightened of what he says, after all he saved your life! He saved your life, too! -His straw hat! -I saw him fall into the basket. That's good! He can't have gone up with the balloon! -Yes, he did! -No! You picked a good day to see us. You sign up... and then you disappear. Why? We don't like when that happens. -We don't like traitors! -I haven't betrayed anyone. No matter, we won't have traitors. When we're in power, we won't need prisons. -What a revelation! -Don't be funny. Though a little insolence doesn't bother us. See who he's with? But those are the Fascists! Prisons are made to escape from. Not ours! We have prisons without holes. What's so funny? -Without holes? -Yes, so what? -Well yes, there is a hole. -Go on, draw us a plan. Don't talk, God please don't talk! What are you waiting for? -Tell them or I'll have to hit you! -Then hit me! -You wouldn't understand it. -How did you get out? You may be strong, but in your dictionary, there's a word missing from the "L"s He didn't talk! Liberty! You're a fool! What do you know about liberty? Liberty is a little hole in a prison, like the marrow in a bone. Enough! We'll see! Let's go! When we're in power, we'll be there forever and you'll be persecuted the rest of your life. And you, all your life, a persecutor. Cemetery! Cemetery! Ulysses... Yes, Ulysses. What have they done to you? Ulysses! Let's get out of here. Excuse me! From the very start, I knew that I was dancing on the edge. No! Look out! Look out! It's a bomb! It's a bomb! It's a bomb! It exploded, it finally exploded!
