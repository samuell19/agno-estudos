ENGINE On July 12th 2006, war broke out on the northern border of Israel. I am unexpectedly called up to replace an officer who abandoned the battlefield, overcome by sudden anxieties. Instinctively, I grab my video camera and place it in my backpack. On this hot July day we travel north on deserted roads, which during a regular summer are packed with vehicles of families and vacationers. Now they have tank marks and armored tracks. The northern towns look abandoned and the higher up we advance, the more the silence becomes mixed with alarming sounds of explosions and sirens. I reach the artillery regiment deployed in the area of farmlands, close to the city of Kiryat Shmona. Mobile cannon barrels and stacks of shells and ammunition are positioned opposite the pastoral landscapes of northern Galilee. Here, during summer vacations, children and families row their boats along the Jordan River. I film the plums and apples, some of which are still on the trees, while others are on the ground, next to piles of discarded boxes and parked military vehicles. We do have fear. We do. The war lies, it feels like a lie. We are stationed in a rather pastoral place, What are your expectations? Fire alert! Fire alert! We're on fire alert, Dudu. SIREN BOMB Fire alert! Let's put our helmets on, then continue? Wait a moment, I'll get mine. BOMBING SIRENS The missile attacks begin towards noon. During the first days I still don't realize their meaning and the fact that our lives are in danger. The only order we are given is to wear our helmets. Beyond that, everyone acts as they see fit. In a split second decision, when the explosions sound too close, I get into the armored vehicle and wait for them to end. In the war room next to me, commands are shouted out to retaliate by opening fire. RADIO STATIC RADIO CHATTER Come on, Ori, another target! RADIO CHATTER Seven, three, seven, seven, six, eight... I walk over to the cannons in the battlefield. I take a shoelace and make a loop for my video camera so I can hang it around my neck, beside my rifle belt. TANK SHELLING I feel that only through the camera can I absorb what I see. The camera mediates between me and the violence around me. SHELLS BEING LOADED Watch out! Fire! SHOUTING TANK SHELLING An artillery regiment is deployed in the area next to ours. This is where I come across Ilan, a 34 year old regiment commander. His voice is soft and captivating as he commands his soldiers. About 500 missiles were fired at Israel today - Carmiel, Safed, Mt. Miron... As I told you that first day, it's clear we are at war, and as this war progresses, there are no rules. We don't know where it can take us. All our batteries are firing non-stop. There's a chance one of our batteries will be inside Lebanon. And when I decide which battery it will be, I will pick my best, most professional one and send it in first. That's it. Look after your lives. My camera is drawn to the look in his blue eyes, a mix of beauty and toughness that makes me think of American actor Sean Penn. Ilan has deployed his troops in the field. He shows me a paper he handed out to his soldiers, only one day after the war broke out. On it he had written: "The regiment must prepare for a long war - weeks". This was contrary to the Chief of Staff's statement that the war would end within days. This is the third week of war and Ilan is still deploying his troops and being told which targets to shoot at in Lebanon. Ilan's soldiers film a missile battle that breaks out in the area. MISSLE SHOT EXPLOSION We're on fire alert. Rockets... rockets are falling endlessly. In the background I hear Ilan giving orders. Rockets are falling in the valley. Positive, positive. Rockets have started falling. I'm on my way to "post 2". Roger. I see them. Tell everyone to take cover... A rocket fell there too. Can you see the smoke? FIRE CRACKLING SHELL FIRE I've read about battles in history books. I like watching war movies. I never thought a day would come when I would be part of such a scene. ALARM RADIO STATIC There, another rocket fall. Don't film me! Don't film me! Listen up, guys. We were on the brink of death here. - Tzur is really scared. - I'm not scared, I don't want him to film me. It's bad luck! It's bad luck! What do you mean "bad luck"? God's with you... Do you hear the fire? Let's go put it out. PLANE ENGINE This war looks like a video game. These are not face to face battles. What does the enemy look like? Who are we fighting? Who are the victims? Commander, "screwdriver" here. Over. We're evacuating him. We obtained a target... Seven, three, two, four, zero, zero. Report when ready to fire. Come on, come on! This is new, fire at it! Work calmly and maintain order, over. Roger. We are calm. TANK SHELLING TANK SHELLING During a break in the fighting, I return to my regiment. I walk among the soldiers. It is their faces that will remain my real memories of the battlefield. Religious missionaries make use of the quiet. Why is a non-believer putting on a tefillin in the middle of a battlefield? OPERATIC MUSIC FROM RADIO Murmurs of Prayer merge with an opera song from a near by radio. OPERA ON RADIO RADIO STATIC OPERATIC MUSIC ARMY VEHICLE ENGINE I go to Kiryat Shmona in the evening. I'm an Armament officer responsible for the cannons maintenance. This obliges me to move from one place to another. The rocket attacks cease at night and the soldiers and few civilians who remain in the town can walk out for a breath of fresh air. Kiryat Shmona, the most northern city in Israel, has endured rocket launches and terrorist attacks for many years. After a period of quiet, hundreds of rockets a day are once again launched on the city, a record amount unlike any other the city has known. The soldiers tell me that Ilan arranged to have his brother in law, Israeli famous pop star Eyal Golan, sing for the regiment, to raise the troops' morale. I am going to look for the military post. First of all, thanks for coming, I really appreciate it. Eyal, come here. APPLAUSE I asked you to come here to sing. The fact that you agreed shows how much you love me. MUSIC You think I am strange and irritable And you say that I am not quite myself. It could be because of love What it does to the soul. You are the light in my eyes, a big beautiful smile You are so pretty you make my heart cry Like the sun, you light up yesterday's dream You turn me on. CLAPPING What am I doing here without you? I have nothing but love. All night long I call you But you don't answer the phone. I closed myself up in the room Pacing back and forth like a madman Life has lost order and direction I have lost interest God, oh, my God... After the war, Ilan tells me this was the first and last time he arranged for a performer to come entertain his soldiers. The length of the war and the many casualties made Ilan decide these evenings were inappropriate. 32 "arrow". 401... Inform quickly when ready to fire. We are all reserves. Most of the soldiers around me are married. They left behind wives, children, families. City people, from the suburbs of Tel Aviv. High tech engineers, students, and lawyers. Sleepless nights and lack of knowledge. How much longer will this war last? Where is all this leading? Aviram... Aviram? Good morning. May I project the spotlight on you? I'm filming. - What's up? - Everything is okay. GROANING - Anything interesting? -What? - Anything interesting going on? - No. That's good. Nothing of interest is best. DISTANT AND FAINT EXPLOSIONS I look around me as I wake up in the morning. It is now obvious that we are all exposed targets. We lie in an open orchard, uncovered. Like sitting ducks. The rockets can hit any one of us, any time, anywhere. RINGING Hello? - Alon. - Yeah? Just make sure you set up the batteries properly. I head about a crew commander who was injured. A rocket fell beside the cannon he was in charge of. Dudu asks me to accompany him to the hospital. We leave quickly, before the noon rocket attacks start. FOOTSTEPS AND SOUNDS OF HOSPITAL - Good morning. - Hi. - I'm not wearing a shirt. - Good morning! Hi. Good morning! How are you doing? You'll have your second surgery soon. He looks OK, he's not... Pretty much... Can you remember what happened? We were standing around, talking, looking through the field-glasses... Then we put the field-glasses back in, kept talking for a while, and suddenly there was an explosion. We were ready with the tray, we had a shell on the tray, and... I was somehow hurled inwards, I was deafened by the noise, and then I stuck my head out, looked at the tank barrel, and realized the explosion came from the left. The next thing I heard was "fire alert" on the radio, and then I heard: "One, is everything all right?" I grabbed the radio and shouted "Negative, negative", I'm not sure if I also shouted "Doctor", and then I fell inside. That's basically what happened there. - How old are you? - I'm twenty-seven. Are you married? I am. And expecting, I don't know yet if it's a boy or a girl. VOICES ON RADIO Thank you. Kobi, just an update on the hospitalized soldiers and civilians in the north of Israel. There are 60 soldiers in the Rambam hospital in Haifa. 21 are severely wounded, 21 moderately wounded and 15 lightly wounded, - Where are you going? - To Lebanon. My camera captures the white piece of paper. It is the combat placement form with the names and military ID numbers of each and every soldier in the tank. This is the last act before going in to Lebanon. If any of the soldiers is injured, that white piece of paper will be used to locate his personal details. During the drills we took this ritual lightly. Here, it symbolizes more than anything the threat to our lives. - Have you seen any Hezbollah? - Only through the eyepiece. Can you describe them? How old are they? They're young, most of them are aged 18-25. That's it. The fighting's tough. Why is it tough? Because you're fighting against... Against ghosts. You fear for your life, for the lives of people around you. We were right on the border, so we saw a lot of guys carried in and out on stretchers. Katyusha rockets... These guys aren't stupid, they're shooting non-stop. They know all our exact positions. Every time we shift positions... They are really accurate. If it wasn't for the tanks, I don't know what we would do, there were some close calls. And... you feel like mice, sirens go off all the time, you run into your vehicle and by the time you... build up aggression and go up to the border waiting to let it out, you begin an operation, but then the operation turns out as non-offensive. It's merely evacuating the wounded. It takes seconds, one crew can finish off two tanks. One casualty in each is enough to keep the entire regiment busy evacuating and shielding. It's frustrating. Over-frustrating. Guy, 34 years old, a tank commander, returns to his crew. Soon they will be re-entering Lebanon. I leave him and pray for his safety. Now your update from Kiryat Shmona which is under heavy missile fire. Heavy missile fire, and the missiles are still falling on Kiryat Shmona, lots of them. The wounded are brought in one after another and are tended to. There are at least two who are fighting for their lives. In addition to the rumors and reports about the increasing number of casualties, the continuing Katyusha barrages cause huge fires. The beautiful northern region has turned into hell. FIRE CRACKLING Katyushas are still falling everywhere. There are fires, flames everywhere. Think about the ambulances, that must make their way to the wounded... AMBULANCE SIREN Come on, I'll show you where the rockets fell. - Look, film this. - Here. Can you see the hole? There's a hole that's been repaired. Take a look. - The destruction... OK. - Look at the pole. Yariv, the pole. Look how badly damaged this car is. SOUND OF RUBBLE UNDERFOOT AND ENGINES RUNNING The panic here is great, ambulances come and go... - Whoa... -What? - Where did it fall? - There! I'm not going anywhere! We are dealing with a serious attack on Kefar Giladi. There are casualties. I can't say any more than that. Right now we are taking care of twenty, and there have... SIRENS There are two ambulances entering Kefar Giladi... Yael, Katyushas are still falling on this city. BEEPING SIRENS SIRENS AMBULANCE SIRENS Back to you, Hadas Steif. This is a very harsh sight, I have no words... Having covered countless terrorist attacks with casualties, this is the most harsh sight I have ever seen in my career. Nine have been killed. Their bodies are right here, in front of me, wrapped in blankets. The local cemetery is right next to them. There are burnt cars and cars on fire right next to me. Many people are standing around, looking, finding it hard to believe their own eyes. Rocket fire on Kiryat Shmona! Guys, vacate the place! A lot of blood here, in this area. It's terrible, a cemetery... Imagine a cemetery with bodies lying around... How many wounded have been evacuated? There are no wounded. There are only the dead bodies on the ground here, in front of us. There is nothing we can do but cry. We are standing at the gates of a cemetery, with the trees burnt down... FIRE CRACKLING TANK SHELLING The rocket launches lead us to react with massive cannon fire. The number of shells we fire increases and it is unclear to what extent they are effective, if at all. I find Eyal, our deputy commander in the war room listening to the orders coming in from the division commander. Have we had success so far? There is frustration about the fact that we cannot stop the rocket fire and suppress it. It is much more complicated than we thought, than we expected. We are not fighting an army, we're fighting guerrillas. Are there times when you're afraid? You, yourself? Back in the day, when I was younger, I never thought about it. Now I've got three kids. When there are Katyushas it's natural to be scared. I can't lie about it. When rockets fall right next to you, when people get hurt... I've just come back from Kefar Giladi, I've seen dead bodies, burnt corpses... Of course it's scary. I'm always a bit afraid that I will need an evacuation and I won't get it. It's all improvisations. We haven't trained the men. This is a lesson for the next war, which, I hope, never takes place. I think the real test is now. We can't be complacent. I ask myself a very important question: Are we really effective? If they're firing onto Salouki Valley or the Litani River, how effective am I? If I fire into a nature reserve that I built a certain way, with a certain system, is our amount of fire really effective? I can never be sure, so I don't fire at random targets. The weeping of radio reporter Hadas Steif, during a broadcast, still sounds in my ears. I decide to return to Kiryat Shmona to locate her. Returning to camp, I come upon the broadcast vehicle of the Israeli army radio station. Who is that woman behind the voice that has become synonymous with this war? I've been chasing the events. We've been to places that were under heavy fire. Kefar Giladi... What were you thinking about in Kefar Giladi? My son is in the army now. I didn't... I didn't think about the effect it has on me, but that's when you become a mother, not a journalist, and the mother inside you is crying. Even if it isn't her son. The emotions come later, at night, at the end of the day, but especially on my way home, on weekends, when I'm alone in my car, listening to music. That's when all the emotions erupt. And... The image that struck me most was during the first week of war, after the first casualties, the armored units left Avivim. I remember I kept seeing their faces all the way home, those soldiers, who for the first time... joined a war for the first time and lost their friends. So I called my good friend and said, crying: "We're sending children to die." Just like that. And now, three weeks later I know... We've been sending children to die. But that's war. That's what everyone says. ENGINE RUNNING It is the third week of war. Friday night. 86 soldiers have been killed till now and the government still sends large troops into Lebanon. The more I film this war, the more the chaos around me increases, and the clearer the aim of my shooting becomes: to show a useless war, whose victims we have become. From a distance I hear the Sabbath eve ceremony. Suddenly, in the midst of war and fear, soldiers seem to respond to this ritual with a particular severity. "...And sanctified it because in it He had rested from all His work that God had created to do. Savri Maranan". LeChaim! "Blessed are You, Lord, our God, King of the universe, who creates the fruit of the vine". -Amen! who sanctifies us with His commandments, and has commanded the holy Shabbat... "You have willingly and lovingly given us Your holy Shabbat for an inheritance. Blessed are You, who sanctifies Shabbat". -Amen! - Shabbat Shalom. - Shabbat Shalom. - What about a challah bread? - Two rolls will do. - There is some salt. - Is there? CHATTER RADIO CHATTER SHELLING INSECTS SHELLING What do you think? If we enter Lebanon, and I mean it, in two hours we all come back in coffins. Two hours. One anti-tank missile and it's over. This is serious, everybody knows it, but nobody wants to say it. I'm saying it... No two ways about it. ENGINES RUNNING I know I represent the military, and as a commander I'm not supposed to talk about it. When people hear the truth, they wake up. And the right people better wake up. SOUNDS OF ARMY CAMP - Ahara'le... -What? What did you do today? You'll like this... Yesterday I came back from my cousin's funeral. - He was killed in Lebanon. - Really? His name is Aharon Yechezkel, like mine. A great guy, 32 years old, who was unlucky enough to get a bullet in his armpit rather than the bullet proof jacket, and that's how he died. He was a sergeant major. And... He was a sergeant major, and he was replacing one of the soldiers who needed a day off, or I don't know exactly what happened. He was just replacing him. During one of the attacks he was shot and killed. My favorite cousin. I have many cousins, we are a big family, but he was the only one that I was close to. We were friends besides that. Just a second. First of all, I'm sorry, I didn't know. It's the least I can do to... Remember him. He meant a lot to me. That's it. VEHICLE REVERSING Let's go over there. How can you come back here? How can I come back here? Well... I don't really want to be back here, to be honest. I'd rather stay home, because... Aharon was part of our family. As a kid I used to spend summers at his place, six weeks. I'd leave home, go to their village... I would walk around barefoot, play basketball with his friends. We were part... He was part of my life. So I don't want to forget him, but on the other hand the best thing is to get back on the horse. What you want to do and what you have to do are two different things. I wanted to stay home, but I had to come up here. So you switch to autopilot and you do it. Thanks, Ahara'le, and take care. I am. I'm feeling lousy, but I'm functioning just fine. There's a difference between the way I feel and the way I function. Ahrale quickly returns to his soldiers. He doesn't tell them he is in painful mourning. He insists on keeping it a secret. He asks me to use my camera and places upon me the responsibility of preserving the memory of his beloved cousin Aharon Yechezkel from the small town of Kefar Yedidia. This is very traumatic for us. There is... You don't want me to say all this? Say whatever. There's a feeling of uncertainty, of disorder. We feel like we've been forgotten here. Help us. Some gear for the soldiers, some information, would be very helpful. Shells, provisions, we're not getting any. What would you like to say? In one sentence. There's no trust. No more trust! The commands are crazy... That's it. Next time no one will come. CAR HORN He's mad because they keep jerking the men around. Yesterday they were told to go to Rakefet, CAR HORN then they were told not to go to Rakefet, but to Lebanon. Then they were told: actually, you're not going to Lebanon. And in the morning they were told to go to Rakefet. In short, they don't know what they want. Do you want to stop here, say "hello"? Yeah. Tell me what's going on inside. It's tough. What kind of fighters are they? ENGINE RUNNING Coerced. Fighters who are forced to be there, and... ENGINE RUNNING And their discipline was... much better than ours. That's what makes them soldiers, not guerrilla troops. It's been a while since you slept, hasn't it? Yes. And how do you feel about this war? What are you thinking? That somebody tricked us. Somebody sent soldiers to die. That's as plain as I can be. Somebody's been using soldiers to achieve something. You don't stop a war in the middle of action, when there are so many casualties, Katyushas and nothing is clear, and of course, the kidnapped soldiers won't return. Well, what can you do? This is our country. Thank you very much. This is the fourth week I am filming the war. Around me the same vagueness, lack of clarity, conflicting orders and an increasing number of casualties. There is word of a ceasefire yet there are plans to conduct a widespread operation in Lebanon. I go to Tel Aviv on a short leave. I am exhausted after long nights without sleep and I have an undeniable feeling of defeat. I recall my first day on the battlefield when my regiment commander told me "Go ahead and film, one day this will become part of history". I pick up a soldier from the tank regiment on his way home to Haifa. I can not see his eyes deeply hidden under his hat. I can only see the digital camera in his hands. I filmed the inside and outside of the tank, where the anti-tank missile entered and exited. I didn't take pictures of the blood. I went in, I saw it, there were guts... Bits of skin, blood, bits of flesh. I didn't want to film it, it was a rough sight. It smelled. - What did you do in the tank? - I was the paramedic. I was sitting in back with the doctor and we were supposed to listen closely to what's going on. To guess what's going on. And what was going on? What's going on is knowing you know nothing at all. So many things happen in those moments. You just keep hearing about crews getting injured, "Trach, trach, trach..." We sit in the back and we... What can we do? Just look at each other and pray. But there's nothing like being outside a tank, because you see what's going on. You have no illusion that what's going on outside is merely a war movie. When we entered Lebanon... Have you seen the film "Saving Private Ryan"? By Steven Spielberg? First the boats land ashore, unload the soldiers, and the Nazis are shooting at them from the shore, killing them like ants. That's exactly how it was. A bus comes, the soldiers get off, start running in every direction because it's scary. Rockets and shells are falling. They run and hide among the tanks. So I got there, and it was very scary. One of our guys got shell-shock. He just started sweating, crying, screaming. And he came to me, asking me to take care of him. I myself was shocked. I didn't know how to respond. What can you do, you know? What could I do, if he sees me sad, how's he going to feel? CAR INDICATOR BUS ENGINE RUNNING Reaching home in Tel Aviv I experience a sense of relief mixed with apprehension. How do I explain to people that a mere 2 hours distance away all hell has broken loose? My city lives and breathes. Its residents carry on as usual. The contrast is sharp and paralyzing. MUSIC The detachment from the battlefield has me glued to the TV screen with a sense of despair. I suddenly hear a familiar voice. We will now turn to Lt. Colonel Ilan Levi, commander of an artillery regiment on the Northern border. Good evening. My regiment is positioned all along the border, from east to west. We have 3 batteries which are constantly firing. We have fired several thousand shells. Aren't you frustrated by the fact that despite the enormous amounts of ammunition you have fired on Lebanon, the Hezbollah still manages to fire several dozens of Katyushas every day? The men here are prepared for a long operation. We didn't think it would end in an instant. In 24 hours, the Israeli government has reached two crucial decisions: one is to accept the cease-fire, the other to expand the fighting in Lebanon. The reporter announces a ceasefire and an expansion of operations in Lebanon in one breath. How do these two coincide? It seems that only one who has just come from that place can fully realize what it means. The air forces has performed the biggest helicopter-borne operations in its history. I return to the war. Yes, the government has indeed instructed the IDF to enter Lebanon, with extensive troops and reach the Litani River. With no logic, no assumption of responsibility, the widespread ground operation in Lebanon takes place as the ceasefire is pending. I look at the landscape of the northern region of my country and think of 33 soldiers that lost their lives in the final, unnecessary 48 hours of this war. Welcome to our section. There is probably going to be a cease-fire. Therefore, Hezbollah might fire all it's got. Has any regiment entered Lebanon yet? We were supposed to go in. After two hours we started... more, after four hours, we started running around like mice... And we didn't go in. They cancelled it. There is no "cease" order, so keep shooting. There have been no reports of a final cease-fire, but it's coming. It's all way too fragile. I don't trust them at all. RADIO STATIC Cease! Cease! Did you hear? RADIO CHATTER Everyone come over here. Guys! Come here. CHATTER The army was very arrogant when the fighting began. I can't evaluate battles and tell if we've lost or won, but the soldiers' feeling is that we definitely haven't won. I want to repeat what Eyal said at the previous briefing, we all got chills when we heard how the soldiers had abandoned their tanks. This is more or less the same. We projected insecurity all along, and we as commanders couldn't... Who was being insecure? Just a second. Think back. Go back to the common soldier - in some of the regiments... - I don't accept it. So let's not cover up. I know enough. Ilan, he sees the bigger picture. Guys, what he's saying is the problem, the main problem. Let him finish. That's the main issue, not standing orders, that is the problem. I'm talking about the common soldiers, how they felt and how much confidence they had to follow their commanders. And what I'm saying is drastic, I'm talking about going into Lebanon. And we as commanders, we've been doing this for years just to get to this moment. When we get a difficult task, not an easy one - to be able to look our soldiers in the eye and say: "Yes, we're going into Lebanon" and one of our vehicles, may catch fire and burn, just so that... If brigade 84 goes in and risks their lives, we're going to risk ours as well. Our job as commanders is to check with our superiors, make sure it all works properly and makes sense, etc. But if in the end, our soldiers don't believe in us, or if we didn't give them that security then we've failed. I'm saying harsh things, but I'm saying this after I've spoken to soldiers. - Don't be offended. - Just a second. If you want to talk about fear, not in this forum. Excuse me, kid! This is Israel's problem. Excuse me, adult, we're the commanders... It's not your problem, or mine, or his, it's the problem of Israel. We should be talking about the provisions we got, about the cannons that endured fire, this is what we should be talking about. Noam, Noam... Just a second. First of all, Udi knows what he's talking about, okay? He's giving us facts. That's one thing. You two started an impolite conversation - child, adult. But there is still a problem which is not only ours as artillery, it's the problem of all the forces who fought this war. But I'm telling you that the first time I heard we're going into Lebanon, I, as deputy commander of the brigade, was told several times that "if this doesn't happen and that doesn't happen, "we're not going in". No two ways about it. And I got a feeling and an understanding as a commander of the brigade, during the war, that there are some people who don't want to go on this mission. No two ways about it. I want to talk about feelings. There were fears, I called them "risks". When I was about to send my regiment into Lebanon, and the day before the division commander came to me, and I said: "Commander, the regiment is ready to go into Lebanon", I understood the meaning of this sentence. I knew I was about to go in and probably not all of us would return. As commander, I must explain the implication, and the implication was, if we were going in through an unsecured route, if we were getting no proper protection, I must report it to my superiors and let them know the risk. By the way, I was at the gate in an armored carrier that had 11 soldiers and 3 officers in it, and all of that after the pre-entry briefing to Lebanon. At the gate, after the briefing, they told me I have to go. At that point, I decided, as commanding officer, that based on the needs of that time and the risks, I didn't receive this from anyone. I am not letting them enter. I said to the commander that I would not let them enter, because given the preparation of the vehicles and the constellation of the men there, the risk was greater than the benefit. By the way, the battery that entered after that was burnt down. And I made the decision, no one else. The north is being vacated of the armored vehicles. A sense of relief is in the air. CHATTER METAL CLATTERING I return home with heavy memories. The shock, the confusion, the indisputable feeling of defeat. Like the aftermath of an earthquake. The surrounding nature seems to regain its original appearance. Soon people, families, children, the many vacationers, will revisit this place during the holidays replacing the gloom and horror of war. Months after the war, I keep filming the people who served in my regiment, those I followed during the war and those I randomly met while wandering about. Their faces are etched into my memory. Later they become the heroes of this film. I have lots of images in my mind. Images like... Snapshots from moments that occurred. Most of them are actually about people. People at specific moments. Then I have so many images. But you know, I haven't written it all down yet. I've written some down, but not all of it. To write as in criticize or for memoirs? To write for myself. Yes. As soon as I write, I start remembering all sort of things that today I would've perhaps done a bit differently. There is nothing like self-criticism. I think that only you know best how to criticize yourself, where you were wrong, based on what you knew. I film Ilan, a standing army officer, as he descends from the northern border into the occupied territories. The landscape of the Galilee orchards is replaced within two hours with roadblocks, the red roofs of settlements beyond the Green Line, and the sound of the muezzin from the distant Palestinian villages. What else do you take with you from this war? The image of my men, at the moment I was... Making the decision whether or not to let them in, it does go through my mind. - Since then, it stays with you. - Yes. I look at them and I think to myself: what would've happened had I decided differently? Did the army criticize you for that decision? Did they raise objections? No, and even if they do, I can explain. WIND The good thing about being able to see Kibia village. From the mosque, right under the "Aviv" buildings. As for the position of the camp, soldiers mixed with civilians. There are no clear definitions. And this is the most serious problem we have around here. MUSLIM CALL TO PRAYER After Ilan is briefed on the new military zone, his schedule is tight. He is going to a ceremony in honor of the soldiers who excelled during the fighting. Less than a month after the war ends, the army celebrates the new year. It's hard to witness the smugness and serenity of officers and soldiers who just now lost a war. Tables laden with fine food, smiles in all directions, when the gloom of the war still hovers in the air. At the "Attention" order, everyone stand up. Attention! Good morning, everybody. We are at the very final stages of this war. There is no doubt that alongside the many achievements we will have to investigate and study. And based on the many lessons and conclusions we reach, we will have to improve and repair. Outstanding soldiers of the year 2006: Outstanding medical assistant: Sergeant Yoni Redner. No tough questions, no signs of remorse. The focus always falls on the brave. It seems that generals hide their own incompetence at the expense of heroic soldiers. To present the certificate of excellence to the soldier... MOTORBIKE ENGINE I last saw Idan the military medic getting out of my car and walking away at an intersection on his way to Haifa. I didn't know if I would see him again. One month after the war, I see him after a class at the Technion in Haifa. What are you showing me now? Some pictures I took during the war. Did you have a chance to show these photos? No. I don't show them to anyone. What is this place? This is the field area a moment before we went in. All around here is where the mortar shells fell. The border is right here. This is... we board the tanks and start to move. The bus came from here. The mortars hit and we just ran to hide among the tanks. And this is the tank you were in? Yes. Here, this is the tank. - Is that you in the picture? - Yes. This is the first tank, the one that led the convoy. It might be the tank that got hit. I don't recognize the guy here. What's this? This is one of the first tanks ahead of us. It got hit by a very advanced anti-tank missile. Such a small hole, kills so many people. I entered one more time. It was all filled with blood. Afterwards an army unit arrived. They cleaned everything up. And I took the pictures. It burned everything around here. I mean, if there was a person here, and there was... He just vanished. The anti-tank missile entered this part of his body, and the guy disappeared. There was this guy with me from the medics course. He also volunteered. For the same position as me. To get into the tank. And be with the guys, with the crew. He hit a mine. I opened a newspaper when I returned. There was this big photo of him. - It's crazy. - What was his name? Nir Cohen. Nir Cohen, may he rest in peace. Here, this is his picture. "The paramedic asked to drive the tank again." God... The fact that it happened to a guy with the same job, what can you do about such a thing? You know that a guy who had the same job as you, got killed. And now you're entering. I told myself I would erase all the photos. I also have lots of photos of people who served with me who got killed. But I just can't throw it away. I'm keeping it always. You just can't. You have to keep them somewhere. This is the renowned hat. Smells like war. Do you remember? A walking distance from Idan's home, I find Reuven, father of five, owner of a clothing store in Kiryat Ata. He remains etched in my memory with his helmet as he sits in a Hummer having left the battle in Lebanon a few minutes before. With a tired look, he uttered the sentence I haven't forgotten since: "We sent soldiers to be killed". It is now one month after the war. He apologizes for the little time he has to spend with me. It's the holidays and he must go back to work at his store. Friday afternoon. In single file. They entered single file. You see those tanks entering there like that. And you ask yourself, what is this? Don't they have a regiment commander, a company leader? Don't they have anyone in charge? What is this single file? And they entered Lebanon, and got fired on from all sides. There were... About 14 or 15 tanks got in single file, 8 got hit. 8 got hit by "sagger" missiles. You are amazed, and you see them after about... an hour and a half, two hours they got hit, returning. They returned. There was no command. You receive an order... At noon they come and tell you: you have to go through this material, start working, see where you should go in, what you are supposed to do. And you get going, you start getting organized. And then you understand you're going nowhere. That it's just not a place you should be entering. You have no business being there. So you find a cartridge in some house. What good did it do? People entered a house and they were recognized, and "sagger" missiles were fired everywhere. Our soldiers are no longer valued. Why did you enter? Why did you enter? CAR ENGINE During the war, I met people completely by chance and seeing them again is surprising. Suddenly I see the worlds from which they came to the inferno of that war. The testimonies in my camera keep growing. Reuven insists on showing me the business he set up 10 years ago, a store for men's clothing. This is my store! I return to Idan in the late afternoon. He takes me to a Thai boxing class not far from his home. He's the only Sabra, surrounded by new immigrants from Georgia, young men training for a regional championship. PUNCHING Hold them in the air. On ten at my count. When I say "One", you do "two". One! Two! I ask myself why, since the war, Idan chooses to spend four evenings a week in a public shelter, learning the basics of this cruel martial art? KICKING MEN SPARRING RADIO CHATTER At ten pm I insist on meeting Ilan again and find him returning from the field. In our talk that morning I was surprised to hear that he had been keeping a diary during the war. I want to convince him to read some of it for the camera. They opened the fence a bit for us. Not much though. We're going to get them at night. I'm in my office. Is it common, these late hours? You call this late? It's 10:30 p.m., it's not late. It's not late. Ask me in a few hours, - then I'll be able to answer. - I see. When I finish today at 3-4 a.m., then you should ask me. Maybe earlier than four. You told me about the things you wrote after the war, that you write in general. - Yes. - Why do you write? I think writing is liberating. Sometimes things come together when you write them down. I'm not a writer or anything. I write about what I'm going through and sometimes I write down my thoughts. Did you write after the war? Some, not much. I read some literature about the war, as if I wasn't there. I found something. It is a bit hard for me, but I decided anyway to... read you something I wrote. I rewrote it, by the way. It wasn't written as nicely as it is now for me to read it. But I will read it. "Thoughts of war. "Now that all the eulogies for the dead have ended, "All the conclusions are made and life is seemingly back on track, "I find myself reflecting. "These are not the thoughts of a commander who fought with his men. "Nor about how well his unit operated. "Nor about the achievements of the war. "You will not find here the heroic descriptions of a warrior, "nor will you find the stories of battles. "These are the thoughts of a man. "Without uniform, without ranks, without barriers. "The thoughts of a simple man who was there and did his best. "It is hard for me to put in writing this kind of thoughts. "These are personal flashes of thought that I had, "probably for the first time in my life with such intensity, "but were never written. "The thoughts of a commander about his own death "have nothing noble about them. "Yes, during the war I looked death in the eye and wondered. "I couldn't explain to myself "how I am walking around there with no fear of death. "And at one moment, when the cannons stopped, "I suddenly wanted to live so much... "An odd feeling of retroactive fear. "A feeling I never had before. For a moment, I felt weak, "I wanted to hug my family. "And to simply be 'Ilan'. "And then, a shout: 'Commander, they want you!' "And once again you are in the world of the strong "that you are accustomed to, looking at your soldiers, "becoming filled with pride and contentment. "Then forget again, "until night and the silence of being alone." You said there is a song you would like to hear. Not a specific song, though the first song is one that sort of reminds me of the war. And I like listening to my brother in law at night before I go to sleep. He's sort of calming. His voice makes me feel good. - Eyal? - Yes, Eyal. Listen for yourself and you will see. MUSIC There are moments When I am out of words Only my head is full of images Noises and imagination BIRDSONG Hi. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. I've got no sound. When am I on the line up? When am I up? Hadas Steif, the radiophonic voice most identified with the war in Lebanon is in her kitchen broadcasting her report on the military radio morning news. Ten more minutes? Give me a call before that. Okay, thanks. We have sound. Now there's this device and it actually enables me not to go to the studio. I'll do my work. I cannot find a connection between the individual I filmed during the war and the person I see here. Does the memory of the war still echo in her mind? The only indication of her military service is a photograph on the fridge of her son the soldier, who fought in the war. After the war I found out that Hadas was the only journalist authorized to enter Lebanon for 48 hours. She witnessed the rescue of wounded and dead soldiers. She risked her own life more than once. Good morning, Golan. In recent days, a high ranking officer in the prison authority was summoned for questioning at the warden investigation unit. A female officer serving beneath him, filed a complaint, claiming that he sexually harassed her. Meanwhile, the female officer was reassigned and distanced from the suspect at her own request. DOG BARKING - "Iron numbers!" - Iron numbers, one. "Three. -Four. -Five. -Six. "Hadas, you're 18. -18. -18. "We arrived at the village walking quietly, going into house number 6, "the house that was set for us. "Entering Lebanon was foreboding. "They still couldn't believe that I was going in with them, and on foot." Did you realize that you're entering Lebanon? I'm experiencing it now. I mean, when I hear it retrospectively, but there... It's part of the job. I was working. The voices, and taping and lugging this heavy thing. And don't forget I had a helmet on my head and a heavy vest and the equipment on me. Have you listened to these tapes since the war? No. I listened to them right after the war and that's it. I haven't listened to them since. "I saw you commanding the evacuation. - "How do you feel right now? - Nothing. - "I did what was asked of me. - That's all." - Who is in this photo with you? - Yariv, my son. Do you see the date? July 17. He was in the artillery corps. He was on the border. He got to one of the posts there, and this is our first meeting during the war. This is the North hotel. We were broadcasting live under Katyusha fire. Now... I was outside, I wasn't inside. So I took cover under this bench. Here is where I laid down and continued my transmission in order to be outside. This is a hole made by a Katyusha rocket. These are the funny shoes I wore in south Lebanon. This is that meeting with my son, we're chatting. It was only about 5-10 minutes, no more, because he had no time and had to run. I'm with the earphone as usual. I don't even feel it and I'm interested to know what happened. Mother and son. "Ilan, how many men are going out for rescue right now? "There are many wounded, we need stretchers, "each stretcher requires four men." RADIO CRACKLE I leave Hadas Steif as the sounds of the war still resonate in the background. I return to Tel Aviv and see people flocking to the square. Initial findings about the failure of the war have been published by the inquiry committee headed by Judge Winograd. Public shock brings people to the square to protest. Just like a theatre play, the leaders and TV stations separate themselves from the people, standing on platforms and cranes, made up like actors on a stage. In the name of national responsibility we came here, to the city square, and in its name we ask you: Can you lead Israel in crucial decisions? You can't! No more spins! Olmert, resign! Olmert, resign! The people want the Prime Minister's head and the heads of the other two they find responsible: the Minister of Defense and the Chief of Staff. Go home, Olmert! CHEERING Go home, Olmert! Go home, Olmert! While wandering around the protest, I suddenly see Ahrale. The last time I saw him was during the war when he told me about the death of his cousin Aharon Yechezkel. Now this protest reunites us. The Minister of Defense, guilty or not guilty? Guilty! Should the Minister of Defense go home, yes or no? Yes! I can't hear you! LOUDSPEAKER IN DISTANCE BICYCLE BEING WALKED THROUGH A STREET So the last time we met was during the war. That's correct. And what've you been up to since then? Well, since then, interesting stuff happened. It began with a trip abroad. For about two weeks, to get some rest. There I met my current girlfriend. Then I quit my job. I took three months off, to relax on the beach. And in all this... Do you somehow connect this to the war? Does it resonate? Yes, the connection is very clear. Some time ago I was called up for reserve duty. And just before... I developed some symptoms of PTSD, which is simply speaking, some kind of combat fatigue. It made me dysfunctional for some time. I'm still dealing with it. And when I talked about it with the... You don't have to talk to anyone to understand it. I mean, quitting my job, sitting on the beach, not working full-time. This was all meant to release the stress I felt, because I wanted some time off. And that's it. Now I'm trying to forget about it, to rehabilitate. Find a full-time job and start working, but basically... Of course it resonates, the echo is very clear. Everything I did - my job, what I did in my personal life, was very much affected by the war. So it appears to be over, at least I thought so, and suddenly it rises to the surface again, something like two weeks before I was scheduled to go to reserve duty. What does it mean that it surfaces? Truth is, there is no point in going into detail. I don't want to describe exactly what happens because it is a bit personal. But what exactly does it mean, in terms of daily function? It means that at first I had trouble in answering calls from people I didn't know. I couldn't always concentrate on my work. I mean, I didn't work at all for almost two months. I stopped studying in the university. I started a degree in the university, in Tel-Aviv, History and Philosophy, and in fact I stopped studying, I didn't attend the semester at all, because I just couldn't understand what they were saying. It was that bad. And this is the rundown of what I was going through. Besides that, there are the emotions, but it's a bit... I don't want to get into it. It's too personal. Okay. TRAFFIC TRAFFIC The sea is very near. Ahrale leads me towards the sea. It seems that watching the sea has really become his source of relief. TRAFFIC WAVES CRASHING When we talked about the post-traumatic symptoms, what do you mean, you don't answer calls? It means you look at the phone and you tell yourself: "Okay, I will answer this person in a minute". Or: "I don't want to answer him right now". I just didn't pick up for people I didn't know, or people that I knew, but who weren't close enough to me. I didn't care whether they left me a message or not. Because if I would start answering them, then I would start either crying on the phone or just... I don't know, feeling a lot of stress. And I decided that in order not to suffer more than I am suffering at the moment, that I just don't care. I disconnected my cell phone, put it on "silent" mode, and it didn't matter how many calls I received, I didn't answer any of them. I just didn't care. WAVES CRASHING DISTANT MUSIC At the same time not far from Tel Aviv, I am invited to Guy's wedding at the Fort of "Antipatris". I recall how he described with a blank expression the battles that quickly turned into rescue missions facing an enemy he called ghosts. Hello. Good evening. Pleased to meet you. Congratulations. A few weeks after the war he decided to leave the country and moved to Nigeria. This morning he landed in Israel for his wedding. MUSIC Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the wedding of Guy and Moran. This is a great day for you, in which you are entering into a pact of love in order to start a Jewish family. Behold you are betrothed. To me with this ring. According to the law of Moses and Israel. Mazal... Tov! MUSIC I look at the guests dancing in the ancient "Affek" fort, the sight of Historic bloody battles. MUSIC Guy and his friends are dancing ecstatically. The war seems further and further away. Who can even remember it. MUSIC I'll give you a small brief, Last year, before I came to Nigeria... there was a war with Lebanon, and I was there. Did you know Guy came from the war to Nigeria? I didn't know he took part in the war, but of course if you're from Israel you've been fighting war all your life. What are you dealing with in your business? We're trading, you know, we do a lot of things. We do a lot of things, so... we are trading. All kind of commodities mainly. OK. And one part is more concerning security and law. That's the main two things that we are handling. Do you remember where Guy was a year ago? Yes. When the war started, they took him to reserve duty. And we thought he was going and will be back in no time. As if, "I'm just going for a second". And every time we asked Moran, who is now his wife, "What's with Guy?" She would answer, "no, "he's not in Lebanon, he's just organizing... "all sorts of things they should get for the army, "for the guys inside and all." It appears that all along, this was not the case. He was in Lebanon a couple of times, and I had this feeling that something was going on. MUSIC Did you know what he's going through? MUSIC Give me a minute... I just worried a lot. MUSIC I cried every day because I didn't... We didn't hear from him, and I was very scared. MUSIC MUSIC Yariv. Life is more powerful than any of us. That's the main thing. Things happen every moment all around the world. We're just actors who change roles in this movie about everything that happens here. And it's important to reach the end with memories such as these rather than the memories of last year. As you've seen, I have a Nigerian partner, and I have Syrian and Lebanese friends, and we're all human beings. And all have the same desires, same angers, same loves. And may it be that one day, though not in our time, everything will be different. MUSIC And I hope this won't be a war movie, but a movie about life, not about death. As you see, people are living here. And they live well. And the other side lives well too. And we must go on. MUSIC I shall give you roses A bundle of cherries And a song with a tune An invitation to a wedding. I shall give you roses A bundle of cherries And a song with a tune, An invitation to a wedding. An invitation to a wedding. An invitation to a wedding. An invitation to a wedding. SINGING HELICOPTER EXPLOSION RADIO STATIC MUSIC
