I love you. Love you, too. So, "city councilman Paul James"? What do you think? I love it. So Jane gave me her keys. She said thanks. She'll watch our place when we go to the mountains. Three weeks in a cruise ship. I'd be bored out of my mind. Well, I think that's what she's hoping for. Open the door. Alrighty. Nice quilt. Thank you. Oh, national geographic loved the piece that I did on camping in the adirondacks. They want me to edit a piece on deep-sea fishing in islamorada. That's wonderful. You're wonderful. We have the house to ourselves. Oh... I... have to go to the office. What? There's a meeting on Monday. It was supposed to be next month. No. There's a file I need. Come on. Do you have to go? It's the McGregor deposition. I'm their lawyer. Yes, I have to. Beth... What? I have to go. Yes, but you have a stain on your jacket. No one's going to notice. I noticed. Future city councilmen don't walk around town with stains on their jackets. Let me see. Oh, so handsome. Not ones that are married to me. All right. I'll see you later. Hurry back. No! Yes, my husband's been shot in his car in our driveway. 24 sheffield road. Please, hurry up. Beth James. Please hurry! Send the ambulance! Send police! Send the ambulance... No! No! No! No!

I'm detective Vanessa rhodes. I'm in charge of the investigation. We found your husband's dog tags on him. I'll make sure that we get them back to you after they're processed. I met your husband a few times. I'm very sorry. You saw it happen? I was... In the window. I'd like you to walk me through it, if you feel that you can. He had... He had a hat on. I couldn't see his face... And he went that way, and he ran. You have to go find him. Mrs. James, look, you know what? We're all over the neighborhood. We'll do everything we can, okay? I promise you that. Come on. It's okay. Come on. Beth! ♪ ♪ I don't remember my mother. I was only two when she died. All I remember is daddy, laughing at my stupid jokes, reading me books before bed, teaching me how to throw like a boy. You know, when I met your dad, he told me that he was a lot of things to a lot of people, but what he was most proud of was being your dad. He loved you so much. He was all I had until you came. Then I had both of you. Now... I love you, Beth. Oh, baby. I love you, too. So much. Oh, I've known Paul for years. You might find this interesting. This goes back... Two... Oh, hi. Hi, Beth. Hi, Bob. How are you doing, you and Robin? One day at a time. Come on in. Beth, this is Jerry Calhoun. Jerry's a private investigator. My condolences, Mrs. James. Thank you. I've been retained by beneficial secura life to conduct a fraudulent claim investigation. Fraudulent claim? Yeah. Standard procedure, Mrs. James. Oh. After all, you did take out a $750,000 life insurance policy on your husband just three weeks before he was murdered. Yes, I did. Paul told me to buy that, because he didn't think that he had enough insurance and he wanted to make sure that Robin and I were taken care of. I see. Nevertheless, beneficial secura's withholding payment until the matter of your husband's murder has been resolved. Beth, why don't you have a seat here. Would you like a coffee? Uh, no... No, thank you. Beth, until this insurance business is taken care of, I need to know how you're planning to make the mortgage payments. Um, sorry, Bob. What... What are you talking about? Well, the house payments, the credit cards... Where do you plan on getting the money? From our savings accounts, mine and Paul's, and Paul took out several retirement plans. Bob, what's going on here? You're the president of the bank. You don't know this? Paul said everything was fine. Why didn't you talk to him about this before? I did, Beth. Several times during the last six months. I'm sorry, Bob, I can't even spare 10 minutes. It's an arbitration. You know how that goes. You're three months behind on the rent. Bob... You're taking advantage of me, and I don't like it. Bob... Bob, relax, okay? Let's... let's meet for lunch next week. This can't wait until next week. I've had my office in your bank building for 12 years. Paul, listen to me. This is not my building. This is not my bank. Now, I have a board of directors that I have to answer to. I have always paid the rent. It's not just about the rent, Paul! You're three months behind on the mortgage. What about my... Your lines of credit are fully extended. There's nothing in your savings account, and your retirement accounts are empty. Now, this is serious business, Paul. I need more time. I can't give you any more time. The board has directed me to start proceedings, and I can't put them off. This whole mess is going to get very public unless you deal with it right now. Okay, detective, I want this to stop. I don't care that you have a warrant. This is my home. My daughter and I, we live here. Detective, the man you're looking for is still out on the street, and you're ripping up my home. Mrs. James, we have looked and looked again. We're still looking for this man. We can't seem to find him anywhere. No one saw him. I saw him. Okay, well, we'll keep looking, but right now, we've got some issues that we need to resolve. What kind of issues? Master bedroom is clean, and there's nothing in the living room. Car keys? Mrs. James? Car keys. Detective, what issues? It was a gas fire. We dug up the dirt around your husband's car, sent it off to the lab. That's how we know. They analyze the gas, chemical composition, the additives... It's like a fingerprint. They can even tell me what station it came from. Anyway, that's why it burned so hot and so fast. Bullets ball up in a fire that hot. You can't do the ballistics. That's what happened to the bullets in my husband? Two out of three, but the one in the head was protected from the heat by the skull. Ballistics was able to read that one. .45 caliber acp. Came from a Colt 1911, a semi-automatic sidearm used by the army for 40 years. You know, your husband owned one. You think that the man that shot my husband used his own gun? Well, we need to look into that possibility. Detective, my husband's gun is not in my car. Mrs. James, it's our responsibility to make sure no stone is left unturned. Detective rhodes, over here. Hey. Let's get a picture of this. 25 grand.

Doug zwick. You know who he is? No. No, but that was found in my husband's jacket the night he was killed. Friday, 10:15. That's when he was murdered. You say you found it in his jacket? I don't say I found it. I did find it. Look, it could be anybody. It could be nobody. Yeah... Or that could be the man that murdered my husband, or he might know something about it. Okay. We'll look into it. All right? Yeah. I didn't do it, detective. You're making a big mistake. I'm trying not to, Mrs. James. ♪ ♪ Nice office. What are you doing here? That's a misplaced question. I'm not the one who broke in. I have a key, Mr. Calhoun. This is my husband's office. I have every right to be here. Well, as a point of law, Mrs. James, this office became the property of the fenton police department the moment your husband was murdered. Well, you don't have to stay. Why don't you tell me a little bit about him. No? All right. I'll tell you what I know. Born and raised right here in fenton. Joined the army right out of high school. Finished his tour of duty, and then he put himself through college and law school. Came home a hero. Marries a local girl, has a kid, hangs out a shingle, and joins a church. Life is good... Till two years later. His first wife dies in a horrible car accident. So he raises his daughter on his own, becomes a member of the vestry, little league coach, pta co-chair, finds the time to rise to the rank of major in the fenton detachment of the army reserve, while at the same time, expanding his law practice, all-around pillar of the community, then he meets you. I don't like you, Mr. Calhoun. Yeah, I get that a lot. Four months into a whirlwind relationship, he decides to ask you to marry him. You say yes. You honeymoon in Martinique, return to fenton, and legally adopt his daughter Robin as your own. You're arrogant, and you're annoying. A year after that, you take out a $750,000 life insurance policy on him. And you're unbearably smug. Three weeks after that, he's dead. Well, you know everything, don't you, Mr. Calhoun? Not by a long shot, Mrs. James, not yet... But I will. Everyone here is very sorry about the major's death, ma'am. Listen... Jack, I wanted to ask you about another soldier here. He might have been a friend of my husband's. Doug zwick. Yes, ma'am. They were friends. They met in the army. Oh, well, is he here? May I talk with him? No, ma'am. He's on extended leave. He'll be gone six months. Well, is there somewhere that I could reach him? Jack, I wouldn't be asking you this if it wasn't important. I don't know where he is, ma'am. This isn't the first time he's taken extended leave, and when he's gone, he's gone. Listen, Beth, as far as I know, sergeant zwick manages a used car dealership in Warren county. It's about an hour, 1:10 from here. It's called hare auto. Maybe they can help you out. Thank you. Operator. Yes, I need a number for hare auto in Warren county, please. 2324? Thank you. I wish he would've told us. I guess he just thought he was letting us down. He never let me down. I know, sweetheart. I know. I'll get it. Yes, hi. Is this hare auto? I'm looking for Doug zwick, please. Do you expect him back later? Will he be coming in tomorrow? Can you please leave him a message... Elizabeth James... What are you doing? We have a warrant charging you with the murder of Paul James. You're under arrest. Are you kidding? The gas in the can started the fire. The ballistics of your husband's gun... This is wrong! The one we found in the sewer across the street, match the bullet in your husband's head. Your prints are all over the gun. I didn't kill my husband! We found the gas can in the garbage, we put the murder weapon in your hands... It's no mistake. Robin, listen to me. I didn't do this, okay? I did not do this! Let's go. Hey, Jerry. How's it going? Hey, Steve. How are you? Nice tie. This one? Really? I was going to throw it out. My ex-wife gave it to me. I hear you. Thanks. Mrs. James. Isn't this over for you? Wife murders husband for insurance money. Held without bail. Case closed. The way I understand the system, you're innocent until proven guilty. Unless, of course, you're just telling me that you are guilty. That would make my job a lot easier, you know. I didn't do it, Mr. Calhoun. I didn't do it. Then who did? I don't know... But he was supposed to meet a friend from the reserve that night. Doug zwick. Yes, and somebody needs to be talking to him. Find out what he knows. Baylor and rhodes ran that one down. It was a dead end. No. Yes. I was talking to the d.A. He's getting ready to file an additional charge against you. Embezzlement. Says he has reason to believe that you stole and hid $800,000. You were with me at the bank, Mr. Calhoun. He told me my accounts were empty. I don't have $800,000. You really don't know, do you? No, I don't... Mr. Calhoun... But you do, don't you? Your husband had a client. A real estate developer with a problem. My client had every intention of repairing the property. But he didn't do the work. He was taking bids. Show me the list of contractors. He was preparing to take bids. And my client is preparing to sue him. My clients have suffered significant financial damages, Paul. We don't argue that your client is owed money. You want to discuss a settlement... I'm listening. In return for your client dropping the lawsuit, my client will deposit $750,000 into my trust account while we negotiate in good faith. Not enough, Paul. One million, or we go forward with the lawsuit. 900,000, and we meet next week with the accountants. I want written notification when the money is deposited into your trust account. Hey, Ellen. It's Beth. Not so good. Listen, thanks for taking care of Robin. Yeah. Can I please talk to her? She's with Andrea where? Can you just tell her that I'm on the phone? I don't have a lot of time. Yeah, I know she's upset, but just... Just get her on the phone. I just have... I know. Mm-hmm. Okay, well... Um, I'll call her in a few days. Ma'am, it's time to wrap it up. Can you tell her that I love her? Okay. Right this way, please. I think we should accept a plea. If you plead guilty, the d.A. Will take the death penalty off the table. Look, Mrs. James, your husband grew up here. Everybody loved him. They don't know you. I didn't kill my husband. They have a murder weapon with your fingerprints on it. We went target shooting five, six times. His fingerprints are on it too. They have a very strong case. I don't care! We can't win. I didn't kill him, and I'm not telling Robin that I did. All right. Okay. I'm never going to tell Robin that. Hey, guys, how many electricians does it take to change a lightbulb? Very funny. Guess you heard that one, huh? Uh-oh. Look who's back. You catch anything? Just a bad cold. Well, that'll teach you to go camping when it's raining. Next time, I'll call you first, and you can put in a good word for me. Oh, yeah, me and mother nature... Call an ambulance!

State patrol's got cars on all highways coming in and out. I want this town sealed, okay? Buses, trains... I want the roads shut down. This is Paul James we're talking about. Prospective city council member, local hero... I don't want any excuses. I want to know where Beth's at, I want her in custody, and I want her sitting in this office... Now. Yeah, this is Calhoun. Someone there paged me. Hello? Hello? Mr. Calhoun. It's Beth James. I need to talk with you. You're the only person it seems might believe me. Well, this isn't exactly the best time, but sure, go right ahead. No, not on the phone. Yeah. I have a place in mind. I had to make sure you were alone. It's my responsibility to tell you to go back and give yourself up. Anyone who had their doubts before, Mrs. James, well, you can pretty much bet they know you're guilty now. Well, then you have to help me. "Aiding and abetting." That's what they call helping a fugitive. You put me at risk just coming here, you know. You put yourself at risk. I'm criminally liable from this point on. Yeah, and I'm under arrest for a murder. If you really didn't do it, let the cops and the courts handle it. You're just making it worse for yourself. This is what I cannot wrap my head around. Why? Mr. Calhoun... Do you have any children? I was married once before... And we wanted to have a child, but it... I worked too much, he worked too much, it didn't happen, then the marriage ended, and then I met Paul... And Robin. She's my daughter. That's why I'm doing this. Yeah. I have a daughter. Her mother will tell you that I was married to the job long before I was married to her. L.a.p.d. Vice. 10 years. Well, then you have to believe me. That's just it, Mrs. James.

No, I'm fine. Thanks. ♪ ♪ Hurry back. That's how they do things, Mrs. James. I hate you. Yeah. Calhoun. Mr. Calhoun, this is Robin James. Robin. Are you okay? What's wrong? The cops are here. They follow me everywhere. They're watching me. Listen, sweetheart, it's not you that they're after. It's... It's Beth. Where is she? I don't know, Robin. She called me last night. She sounded so scared. Listen, they didn't get her, Robin, okay? I know she's still out there. Did she kill my father? I don't think so. The police say she did. Listen to me, Robin. Sometimes the police can be wrong, and sometimes... Sometimes it's just easier that way. She was telling them about this guy, Doug zwick. Did he kill my father? Yeah, he might have. Listen, Robin, your father got himself in way over his head. He borrowed a lot of money from this zwick guy and some of his friends. They're a dangerous crowd to run with. I just... I don't know who to believe. Listen, where are you right now? I'm at my school. Okay, in about five minutes, I'm going to be coming around the back. All right? Okay, stay put. Yes? Yeah, it's me. ♪ ♪ She loves you, kid... A lot. She said you were like the daughter she never had. The daughter she always wanted. Why don't you go talk to her. Thanks. For what? All I did was give you a ride to the park. Get out of my car. Are you okay? Yeah. Are you? Been better. I used to come here when I was little. Daddy took me. My dad used to take me to the park, too. There was a duck pond. You know... We used to leave the bread out so it got really stale, and... I must have been five or six. I told them that you were staying at the Clarks', that you were driving Jane's car. I saw you leaving the school. That's how I knew. Yeah, but you called Mr. Calhoun. Yeah. He said the police didn't want to hear about daddy borrowing money from Doug zwick. He said they called him, couldn't find him, and that was it. They don't care. Yeah. But... If Doug zwick really did murder my father, someone has to find him. Yeah. I like your hair. Oh. Huh. Yeah? Thanks. I was so worried about you. I just wanted to make sure you were okay. I'm sure you're doing all your homework. Don't forget to lock up, boss. I'm out of here. Yeah. Yeah, it's taggert. Ah, what did you forget this time? Sit your ass down. Sit your ass down. Sit! You guys are making a big mistake. Stay. What the hell is going on here? Who do you two idiots think you are? Hey, I know you. You're that insurance lady. Uh, Calhoun. Actually, it's Beth James, Mr. Bronski. Yeah, Paul James' wife. Oh, for god's... Well, who the hell are you? You don't ask the questions, fat man. My husband owed you money. He wrote you 17 checks from our trust account to pay you back. That wasn't enough. You had to murder him for the rest of it? I didn't kill anybody. Maybe... Maybe not. This right here... Looks like it's good for a nickel stretch at chico, fat man. I guess... We're just going to have to take this to the police. For Christ's sake, lady, are you out of your mind? You really want to mess with me? You murdered my husband, you son of a bitch! Yes. I am completely out of my mind. Talk to the lady. All right! All right. It wasn't me. It wasn't me. I'm not taking the heat for this stupid idea. It was Dougie, for Christ's sake. It was Dougie. He's got a screw loose. You never know when he's going to go off. There was no way to talk him out of it. Look at that poor, stupid son of a bitch. There's 800 grand in that trust account. I saw the statement. As long as it's there, no one's going to miss the hundred large we skimmed off his ass already. Hmm. I'm going to do him. You do the lawyer... Someone's going to come looking for you. Go to hell. I'll put it on his wife. It's her signature on the checks, Pete. Yeah, so she'll take the hit for the cash, but not so you can kill him. It's motive. That's what it's all about. The rest I will take care of. By the time I'm done, everybody's fingers are going to be pointing at Mrs. Paulie James. Doug zwick is the coldest, most calculated con man I've ever worked with. I wouldn't put anything past him. He went by an alias when I met him loansharking six years ago. Christopher curts. C-u-r-t-s. He used it whenever he had to lay low from the cops. I'm guessing that's what he's doing now. Look, it wasn't me. You know it wasn't me. I don't know where he's hiding out this time, but if you find curts, you find Doug zwick. Curts... curts... There's got to be something here. Christopher curts. 15 woodridge road. Zwick, you should have listened to bronski. Yeah? Yeah. Calhoun. It's me. Hi. I think we're going to have to stop seeing each other. The cops found out I took Robin to the park. They're all over me. They've got a guy outside my motel right now. I know. What did you tell rhodes? You know, that she asked me for a ride to the park, I said yes, we hung out for a while, and I took her home. It's basically the truth of it, if you look at it that way. And what about Robin? She's okay. She didn't say anything. I found him. Really. Yeah. He's in the mountains, about three and a half hours. Indian lake. I'm going. I have to confront him myself if anyone's going to know the truth. Uh-huh. The cops aren't going to believe me. Uh-huh. That's great. Well, you know, I don't know if you knew this, but right behind the hotel, there's a little alley. In about five minutes, I'm going to be the guy climbing out the bathroom window. Uh-huh. You bet. All right, that should do it. Try it again. Yeah. Doug zwick, I'm Beth James. You murdered my husband. All right. You're not going to say that. He killed Paul and he framed me. All right, maybe, but you're not going to say that. Listen, I have to get him to admit something that he most likely won't admit, and I think the truth is going to shake him up. The truth? Doug zwick, I'm Beth James. You murdered my husband. Yeah. No. Mrs. James... Mm? Just in case. Look... No one would blame you if something happened, you know. All right. I'm right around the corner. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Mr. Calhoun, he's here. All right, Mrs. James. Stay cool. Come on, talk to me. What... What are you... Hi. Paul... I was worried about you. What? Yeah.

Let me make it up to you... But you killed zwick! Fine... But let's make it earlier. I have a church function at 7:30. 6:00 it is. I'll see you then. There was no other way. You burned him in the car. He was going to kill me. Then you put a gas can in the garage where you knew they were going to find it. Everyone wanted something. Then you dropped the gun in the sewer with my fingerprints on it. They wouldn't leave me alone. You planted the money in my desk. I had to get out. You signed my name on those checks.
