'Head Down, Feet Up' Excuse me! - I'm not stealing it! - Sorry, go ahead. No, I don't feel like it anymore. Now, we'll try the Shirsasana, from the Sanskrit Shirasana. An upside-down position on your head. This is considered the queen of the Asana, which means positions. For its physical and psychological effects. Watch me, and most of all pay attention to the breathing. You have to concentrate on all the muscles in order to avoid any strain. Now, on your knees and lean forward. Rest your head and your arms on the mat. Slowly move your legs and body in an upward position. Breathe in and breathe out Breathe in and breathe out. On reaching the final position you can focus on pure meditation... and reach a complete state of zen, thanks to the perfect balance. That is the physical balance of mind and body. It's me, Marina, I'm landing at nine. You can come and get me if you like. Thanks for coming to get me. I'll make some coffee. I had a nightmare. I was doing my maturity exams. Key word, maturity. What are you doing? Why don't you go to work? I hurt my hand, I can't draw. I'm going to the protest today. A political commitment. How about working on your thesis? For what I need for my degree, it's just a detail. You need it for a pay rise, architect. It's a jacket I got you in London. Well, have they found out who's strangling all those teachers? The poor things are having a terrible time. You're kidding? The usual arrests, the usual stop and search. It's bullshit. How imaginative. I'm the killer! Are you crazy? Idiot! I was joking, don't be like that. Come on, laugh. It's Marco, we'll continue this later. Come in, it's open. The traffic was terrible. I was stuck for over an hour. There's a protest in the centre and... - Something wrong? - No. It's just getting a little crowded around here. Then it's serious! I've got just the cure. A meeting of married couples with problems. Of a sexual nature, of course. An exchange of experience to reinforce the union... They do it in all civilised countries now. Yes, that's fine, only we're not married. Does it matter? No, we're throwing a party to celebrate Charles' return from America. We haven't seen you in the studio for a while. You knew, why didn't you tell me? You don't like Charles, do you? - No, I didn't know. - Right, you were at the protest. - What did Charles say? - Nothing, to be honest. You know he never wants to compromise himself. That's not true. He told me his photography book has been a huge success. They even asked him to collaborate on a film. Can you imagine it? You never know, he made you a photo model. Maybe he can make you an actress. It's hard enough standing still all the time, imagine being an actress. I want to be a lady, nothing else. Did you hear how well your old school friend's doing? Cruel! - Some wine? - No. - You want to eat or drink? - Drink! Nobody wants any wine. - Who'll get me some whisky? - Me! I'll take care of Marina. The guest of honour's rather rude, he hasn't left again already? Don't eat too many or you'll have nightmares. - I have to teach him everything. - He's so romantic! Guys, Charles has arrived! Divine! - Beautiful! - Welcome back, Charles. Are we going to get the guy a drink or not? Ignorant fools! - I'm dying of thirst, what is it? - Drink it, then you'll find out! Idiot, it's some of the finest wine! - I prefer red. - Then let's go next door. You don't know what you're missing! We want to hear everything! ...she stood there screaming like a lunatic! No, don't tell him! - Listen, where's Andrew? - Next door, didn't you see him? - No, I'll say hello. - I told you not to tell him. - It's fun. - That's the second time... Hi, Andrew. - You never liked parties. - Quite the opposite. - My compliments, you made it. - Thanks. - How is it going? - Great! Can't you tell? - You want it? - No, thanks. What were you two talking about? You look so serious. It's frightening! You're a lucky man. She must really love you. - Because she puts up with me? - Come on, you idiot! I'm just saying I envy you. I have done since high school. You were the prodigal designer. I remember that futuristic design project of yours, it was amazing! It made me so angry. What happened to it? Nothing, I won the competition. Right, the competition. I remember now. I stole from everywhere. It still didn't do me any good. Charles, are you kidding? Come on, what do they do at parties in America? Everything! Just like in the movies! I know a game I saw in London. It's a bit spooky but it's fun. One of you has to play a maniac, a sex maniac. Charles! Daniela's the victim. Then I'll explain. Me? Do I have to undress? Wait, wait... I'll need some candles! I'll get them straight away. Are air purifiers okay? Use whatever you like. It's a bit like truth or dare, but reversed. The victim has to guess and if she gets it wrong... - She loses a piece. - Without exaggerating, of course. Hey, kid. Our honour's at stake here, don't let me down. This goes here, and this one here. Charles, you can ask whatever you like, nothing's off limits. Great! - Can I ask a question as well? - No, no, that would be too easy. - Just turn off the lights. - I'll light the candles. How frightening! I'm so scared! - Come on, Charles. - Tell me Daniela, is Marina faithful? I'm afraid so, she's too stuck up! - Is Patrizia a virgin? - What did you say? How are you? Look who's through there. I have my own theory about that. A question for Daniela, how do you explain Charles' success in America? - Now that's a question! - I'll answer that! Because Charles has got the skill and the talent! Wrong! I'm glad you're enjoying yourself. I'm going, I'll see you at home. - It's rude, what's wrong? - I need some fresh air. Think of an excuse for Marco and Daniela, but I doubt they'll notice. As you wish. Daniela, you're still dressed! - Who was it? - An old flame. - A pleasant one, by the looks of it. - For the little time it lasted. - I was so young. - Can you believe it? - Either way, he's grown up. - Hardly! That's why he doesn't count. - A grappa. - Right away. Here you go, sir. Do you think that's good quality? It makes me sick every time I try it. I only drink the good stuff. Otherwise I'd rather go without. I have an English friend, an antiques dealer, who supplies me. I've got some fine whiskies at home. I'm an expert at mixing cocktails. I learnt on my trips abroad. I'm a language teacher. Well, what do you say? Want to come over for a drink? Why not? I live nearby. Do you mind walking a little? Believe me, there's no city like London, it's splendid. Despite the fog. Sure, the weather's great here but you can't have everything. - You're not from Rome? - No, no... What do you do? Something artistic? - Yes, in a sense. - I thought so. What would you have done? Sorry, I got distracted. We've arrived. I live here. It's okay if you've changed your mind. It's late, I understand. It was very kind of you to walk with me. I confess that's why I was a little bit pushy back there. There was a guy at the bar. There was something about him. I don't know what, but I got scared. You know what I mean, we have to be careful these days. Come and see me when you like. The invitation's always there. - Bye, Charles, and thank you. - Goodnight, I'll call you tomorrow. How did it go? Well. It was a wonderful party. - Marco was a bit upset. - What do you care? Did you leave the car at his place? What did you do? I was an asshole. As usual. I'm not in a bad mood anymore and you're beautiful. Parties suit you. - Where are you going on holiday? - I still haven't decided, why? I could come and visit you. Feeling lonely? You don't need to wait for the holidays. Who do you think is killing these teachers? I've no idea, it's probably a lunatic who thinks he's helping the schools. - Why a lunatic? - Guys, my feet are killing me. You left during the best part. It was a splendid game, fantastic. Pity. Listen to me when I'm talking to you. You're always so serious. Fuck you! Got it? And he leaves at the best part. "That's not very good, I don't like that, you don't like that, that's rubbish..." "That's rubbish, that's rubbish..." So? Continue. There must be something we both like. I don't feel like going to the cinema tonight. Well, I'm ready, which means I choose this time. No, I've already decided. We're staying in bed tonight. - I told you it was rubbish. - We're here. Listen, I want to tell you about something that happened to me. - Is it about us? - Of course. It's about me but it's about you as much as it concerns me. Anything that happens to us separately concerns us both. Seriously, the other night... - Sleep if you're bored. - Come on, let's go. We can guess the ending. I'll talk as much as I like. What was I saying? Yes, the film... - How dare you? - Cut it out. - I want to watch the film. - Don't you touch me! You behaved like a total idiot! Sorry, but he touched me. Wait. Look, it's better for both of us. Okay, we'll discuss it tomorrow when you've calmed down. It was just a bit of nonsense. I'm going to get some cigarettes. Good, my compliments. I see you're making good progress. The client's coming tomorrow and he's expecting a miracle, right? Who cares? Yes, he'll get his miracle but it's not like he understands it. - Have you finished? - Yes, but I'm not an artist like you. Have a look at this. Another teacher murdered. 'Language teacher murdered in his apartment' What happened? 'I'm staying with my sister for a while' Now some meditation, which we'll achieve through these various figures. Of Buddha, of luck... Yes, like that makes any sense. I'll go there and I'll say, "Yes, officer, he looked like a killer" They'll all burst out laughing. No, I need proof. Sorry. - Come on, move it! - Don't push! Watch them. They're the guys who beat up that teacher at the last rally. - It doesn't matter, I've got the keys. - Then why did we ring the bell? - Manners, politeness. - Politeness? It's your home, you've lived here for five years. Come on, go in. What a mess! - "Another teacher murdered" - Leave it, don't touch. "Teacher strangled in her apartment" "New theory about the teacher's murder" Look at how many he's killed. Your Andrew's a jolly one! What the hell are you up to? - Well? What is it? - I don't know, we don't see each other. - What do you think it could be? - Daniela, you're such a pain! 'I've taken some of my things. I tried calling but you never picked up' You wrote it for him but you won't tell me? No. Come on, let's go. The teacher killer's motives still remain a mystery. Among the many hypothesis, the police believe that... given the recent events in Italy, the killer might be a crazed student... and the victim of a certain political ideology. It must be noted that there's no apparent connection among the victims. And once again they eliminate robbery as a motive. Look who it is! The artist. What brings you here? - Nothing. - You never call. - Are you hiding from me? - You've got your rich husband. So what? We're still friends. You can always call. Where are you going? I can give you a ride if you like? No, thanks. By the time you get the car... - Good morning, teacher. - Good morning, kids. - I'll take him up. - Good. But first he has to do his business. Andrew, it's Marco. Come on, open up. I'm alone. Andrew. I saw the light on so I came up. It's pointless calling. Are you not answering on purpose or are you always out? What the hell are you up to? We're a bit offended and a bit worried. - I'm doing my things. - No, seriously, the boss is pissed. - You're not coming to work. - I'll come to the studio tomorrow, okay? What is it? Have you got problems? Or is it Marina? You've figured it all out. Okay, I miss her. I shouldn't be telling you but she must be pregnant. Well that's what Daniela said. How can it happen these days with the pill? Are you sure? - If Daniela said so. - She's coming over tomorrow. I just thought I'd mention it. I haven't said anything. I haven't said anything! Stop it! You see? He's hurt his paws! It doesn't seem real! I convinced him! Let's go! - How did it go? - Very well, didn't you see? A jerk. A real jerk! If you need a nurse for your hands, just ask. Tell me if there's enough salt. Why so much soup if there's only three of us? Because Marco said... Surprise! Guess who's here. Good evening. - You never liked sugar. - Another coffee? No, not for me. I've got something marvelous for you to hear. - Charles wrote it. - Yes, it's fabulous. What do you think? - What is this? Who is it? - Just listen to it. - Isn't it a bit too hot in here? - Yes, let's have a cool drink. Guys, I'm leaving, I've got a shoot tomorrow. - I'll take you. - No, come on, stay a little longer. - Do you want a cigarette? - No, thanks. I do, but I don't have any. I've got some, I'll light it. I saw all those newspaper clippings. About all those murders. What is it? Does it interest you? Curiosity. Do you think it's some crazy student as well? - No. - Don't you want to talk about it? I tried at the cinema but you didn't feel like it. Now I don't feel like it. I thought you had something else to tell me. You think too much. Stop at the corner, I want to walk. I can't believe I'm doing this shit at thirty. Idiot. I met a gay guy who was murdered. If I'm convinced I know who the killer is. I have to go to him and tell him... Look, there's someone who wants to kill you. Yes. Hello, is Marina there? I understand. It's Andrew. Good day. Stay still. All done. I'm finished here. Come on, Margaret, let's change the ladies' fur coats. No, no, and no. It's no use explaining. For crying out loud! Go to hell! Stop bothering me! What did you say? I can't hear! What are you saying? - Four, what? - They're all dead. - What? - The teachers. What did you say? All I understood is that you killed four teachers with a friend. Let's dance. - I'd really like to meet that friend. - Why? You still don't know him? - What are you talking about? - Someone's been killing teachers. I saw the man who killed them. But I don't know his name or where he lives. But I did a portrait. A fine portrait! - And you're certain? - Sure, I know it was him. But how can I prove it? - I like him, I'd like to meet him. - Don't talk nonsense! Let's get out of here. What is it? Maybe because you drank? How do I know? It's never happened before. Yes, once when I was eighteen, with a prostitute. - But she was so ugly. - Thanks! You're such a fool. What's that got to do with it? That's why this is more serious. Do you want to stay here tonight? Maybe later... Rest a bit. No, I'm embarrassed and I'm going. Sorry. Bye. If you don't call me! Hoc est enim corpus. For this is my body. And this is my blood. What do you think about me? Are you crazy? No, really, we always say what we think about others but never about us. It should be normal between friends. Right? We've known each other forever. But no, we never know what we think of each other. That's a good one. What's the point if we're friends? Besides, it's embarrassing. - Do you want to tell me something? - That's exactly it. Do you think I'm normal? You want to know if you're normal? Sure, like everyone, yes... You can be strange, a bit childish, but you're perfectly normal. If you ask me, you should try to be a bit more down to earth. And you should get yourself together like all normal people do. Like adults do, I mean. You refuse to grow up. Like you're waiting for something. Waiting to tear it all down. Do you expect the world to change? You've got to adapt, try to fit in. That's being mature. Sorry, but what Marina says is right. Look at how you behave with her. You know what I think? Maybe a baby would help me grow up. Am I right? Yes, hello? Hello? It should have my creativity, my personality, Marina's looks. Whether it's a boy or a girl. Blonde hair, blue eyes. - What is it? - I thought you'd be feeling lonely. - Shall we call a truce? - I'm not upset. I can see you're upset. Would you like a drink? Whiskey? Come on, first smile then I'll tell you everything. Have you got something important to tell me? - Go ahead, I've got nothing to say. - Come on, I know. - What? - That we've conceived. Not anymore. What? I haven't got it anymore. But... What happened? - Or was it you? - I decided, given that... - That we're not married? - No. Because I haven't got any money? No. I asked you why you did it? Because you've got to want it. That's why. It's an important decision and we've got to be responsible. What are you going to do? This is for not telling me. You know that I own you, that's why you're after me. But I'm not a teacher I'm just like you. - I'm sorry but I have to do it. - Who are you? Yes, okay, there's a message as well. Go. How can you be so sure? Probably another lunatic. We couldn't trace the call. He might be using a pay phone. What do you know? It's the first thing he said. - Well, what do I have to do? - Change body, imbecile! It's a good portrait, artistic. Yes, this is all we need. Well we can't leave any stone unturned. - Get some copies sent out. - This is the message. "Stop this man, he's the killer but act quickly" "I'm not crazy, you've got to trust me" That's it. It's Pia, seeing as you don't do it, I'm calling you. Call me. Bye. What if I can't get it up again? I can't risk it. "It's Rita, sorry to disturb. "But here at the studio they'd like to know what your plans are?" "Marco's in Milan. Call me at home if you prefer." Hi, it's Andrew. What are you doing? Nothing. Did you get my message? - Is your friend with you? - She's watching TV next door. Why don't you come here? Then we talk about the studio. - Really? - I'm sick. - It's serious. - That's different then. - It's my duty. - You're still on the phone? Hurry up! Come in. It's nice here. You've really made it your own since Marina left. Come on, cut it out. What do you care? - Now where does it hurt? - Everywhere. - Here? - No, lower. - Here? - Lower. - Here? - Lower! - You're in better shape than me. - Yes? Then I'll check you! Does it hurt here? Here? - Weren't we supposed to talk about work? - Later, later... The Inspector's very busy. Be patient. I am, but it's important, we can't waste precious time. - Any news? - He doesn't exist? No, he exists, it just looks like he doesn't live anywhere. He doesn't have a fixed abode. Our only lead is that he's been spotted in the Monte Sacro area. Then we need to intensify the search in this area. Send extra men if necessary. - No trace of the man in the portrait? - We pulled some prints. It takes time, we're checking. - You finally called me. - Can we meet? Why this tone? - What mood are you in? - A shitty one! ...and also with Marina. No, I don't know. She said we should separate for a while. But after what happened I don't know what to do anymore. I think I'm going crazy. How do you explain that while I was going to see her... the idea of having a kid made me furious? Then, when she told me she had an abortion... - The first thing I felt was relief. - But you still attacked her. Of course, she had no right to make that decision alone. There's nothing good left in you, and what little there is... You destroy it with pride and sarcasm. Is this why you wanted to see me? No, I have to redeem myself with you. I'll come to your place tonight. Forget it, it's not a good time. - Are you offended? - Yes, and I'm disappointed. Just give me until tonight. I reported the guy who's killing the teachers and now he's following me. - I told you about it. - But you were friends. - There's no need to be afraid. - Don't joke, this is serious. Sure, sure. Why don't you call a friend? No, I can't tonight. What are they doing? How long does it take? And now an update on the teacher murders. Following a tip-off, the police are looking for a man in Monte Sacro. Despite the delicate nature of the case, news has leaked... that they intend to intensify roadblocks in that area. Nothing is known about the suspect. Inspector, she's the porter from via D'Ovido, 76 She wants to talk to you. She's been here all morning. Have a seat. - Olga Giannelli. - A pleasure. Inspector, I've seen the killer. Yes, it's him. Look. Right in front of my apartment. What was he doing? He was looking around. I don't know. Yes, okay. Then come back. How would you describe him? You know, a regular guy. False alarm, the man identified in that hotel has only been in Rome four days. He also barely matches the description. - What brings you here? - I didn't feel like going home. Actually, I was about to go to bed. I just got back from Milan... I just want to say hello to Daniela. Hi, Andrew. Join us. Come on, have a drink. Don't trouble yourself, thanks. He's gone. He's turning this into a soap opera. He's not that bothered, it's his character. He always has to be right. No, that's enough or I'll go crazy here. His face is identical to the drawing. - Another teacher. - So, we're back where we started. There's an address here in Monte Sacro. We'll have to carry out a search immediately. You do it, immediately. Search everywhere, question everyone. I want all our attention on this. Andrew, are you there? I need to speak to you, it's important. Sorry, have you been there long? I fell asleep. I'm just going to wash my face. I'm sorry about last night. We behaved like real idiots. Like we had something to hide. You should have stayed, you know? I'm sorry but you just turned up like that. It's not very polite. You're not saying anything? Okay, it doesn't matter, we'll discuss it later. I've got some good news for you. His highness has chosen your project... for the interior design of all six hotels. Good job! - The boss will be happy. - Why? Aren't you? Sure, it seems natural to me. Listen, I'm tired of seeing you like this. It will all sort itself out now. With Marina as well. There's nothing going on between her and Carlo. You know that. It will be just like before. But that also depends on you. You've got to make an effort as well. Me and Daniela were thinking of organising a dinner. The boss will be there as well. Nothing more suitable and generous for my complete rehabilitation. Good, you've given it a lot of thought. You're always so sarcastic. It's actually very serious, in my opinion. And this is a great chance to start over. It's time you settled down. Sorry, but artists get old too, you know? Sarcasm is also serious but it's not important, sorry. I really appreciate what you said and I agree. - When is this party? - We thought tomorrow night. It's Saturday, we're all free and we can finish later. But you've got to get Marina. - If she's okay with it. - Finally! What a relief! And on Monday back to work! And a new life! Yes, but don't shout. I need to go, I have to get Daniela from hairdresser. See you tomorrow. Don't be late. And no tricks! My god! You know you can't have tenants unless they're registered. But I assure you he was a good man, poor guy. No trouble at all. It's like he wasn't even here. Our friend was very meticulous. He wrote everything down. Make yourself available. Take this as well. You're the only one who knows everything, what should I do? I don't know. I really don't. I didn't mean to kill him. It was horrible. I don't think they can do anything, it was self-defence. Precisely. No, it's not that, Pia, I'm not afraid of the police or anything. It's what's happening inside of me. I don't understand myself. Help me. It will pass. Don't torture yourself. That man was a lunatic. You've done nothing wrong. Now just relax. Forget about everything you told me. You've got to help me get through this. They're throwing a party for me tomorrow, everything's fine now. You're so damned confusing. I can't keep up with you. But why me? Listen, I can't keep playing mother to you, I'm not into that. It's bad for you as well. So, we'd better... - I don't know... - End it? It all seems quite clear to me. The modus operandi, the fresh prints after every murder. The details. Except for the last possible victim. This mysterious gentleman who probably killed him. This is a pyschiatric report from the clinic where he was being treated. Right, the motive. A philosophy teacher. Removed from his post due to paranoid episodes. Driven by revenge with a chronic persecution complex. - The judge can deal with him. - Then there's the forensics report. The fingerprints found on the victim match the ones on the drawing. Right, Mr X. The only question mark. No matter, the case is still closed. Imagine if they found me strangled like this. What a mess. A psychopath. Totally paranoid. A lunatic. What a betrayal. Are you sure he told you he was coming at nine? At nine. He's not at home. No, he was going to pick up Marina at nine, she told me. - There must be traffic. - At this hour? No? - What do we tell them? - Start eating, everything's ready. They'll understand. You need the degree for a pay rise, architect. Go figure. In this splendid final position you achieve perfect balance. The deconcentration of every muscular effort brings complete relaxation. The physical and mental advantages of this Asana... are known to Yogi's all around the world. Subtitled by Vedic Santosh & Rani Lakshmibai - 2020 - 2021
