My kid brother's having fun. Want to go next? Sure. Want some? An earthquake! Rokuro! lt's an earthquake! Come back! l can't! The rope launcher! Goro! lt's no use! Goro, what's that? Grab the rope! Gotcha. Up there! Similar fissures were found along the North Pacific coast. The Seismological lnstitute believes the second underground nuclear test on Aska lsland was to blame. There's a lingering threat of aftershocks. This is insane. More nuclear tests and they'll blow the Earth to bits. l agree. We could end up at the bottom of the ocean like Lemuria and Mu. lt'll be the end of humankind. What are Lemuria and Mu? Continents said to have existed three million years ago. Lemuria was in the Pacific... and Mu in the Atlantic. But a tectonic event triggered a massive earthquake that sank them under the sea. Think that earthquake destroyed your robot too? Don't even joke about that. - Goro. - What? lt's open. Strange, huh? You big jerk! Son of a...! Goro! You all right? - l'm okay. Rokuro! You guys are okay? Then sit tight! Damn it! They really turned this place upside down. They didn't touch my room. What about in here? lt's a mess, but they didn't take anything. Really? But let's check again just in case. Goro. There's some strange powder here. What could it be? Looks like sand. Damn them! What weird burglars. What were they after if they didn't steal anything? What's that? A button from one of their suits. lt's the same color as that sand. You're right. What sand? This. Red sand... They must have dropped it. We found it at the robot's feet. GEOLOGY LAB Hello. - What are you making? - A minibike. A minibike? You're a racer. You should know. l'm still a rookie. l learned my lesson on the lake. l race on solid ground now. Will it really run? Leave it to me. You sure? You bet. lt'll run. l'm going for a test run. Be careful. Hi. Come in. Hey. lt's finally finished! Yeah, just a few final touches. - l got results on that red sand and button. - And? lt's from a seabed layer 2,000 miles deep. Really? And similar sand is found on Easter lsland. Easter lsland? What's that? A small, uninhabited island about 2,000 miles east of Tahiti. There are huge statues of faces on its desolate slopes. The largest are 65 feet tall. They're about three million years old. Now l'm even more confused. Who were those guys? l did it! lt's done! Congratulations! You finally did it. Jinkawa, let's name this robot "Jet Jaguar." Jet Jaguar? Not bad. lt's settled then. Let's go with that. Help! His eyes are video cameras. And he has an automatic control unit for quickly avoiding anything in his path. lmpressive! You electrical engineers are amazing! Welcome back. lt's open. Shit! Seatopia. This is Seatopia. We read you loud and clear. Same here. We just stormed the robotics lab and captured the researcher. Good work. Have the robot guide Megalon to the attack targets. My people... our underwater kingdom of Seatopia... has lived in peace for three million years. But that peace has been shattered by the reckless nuclear tests of the surface dwellers. Our northern sector was utterly destroyed. We've decided that defeating the surface dwellers is the only way to protect Seatopia. We do this now to ensure that our underwater kingdom of Seatopia can live in peace! For Seatopia! Megalon. Awaken, Megalon! Go forth and destroy the surface dwellers, the enemies of our underwater kingdom of Seatopia. Crush them! Go forth, Megalon! Goro! Where's Mr. Jinkawa? He's not here. Steel. We're in some kind of steel box. l bet they're gonna kill us. What'll we do? Calm down. See if you can untie these ropes. - You got it? - Almost. JSW CONTAlNER Goro! You all right? Hang in there. How much further to Lake Kitayama? - An hour or so, right? - Yeah. l still don't see why you want to drop the container in the crack in the lake bed. What's in it? That's none of our business. But he's paying us 1 00,000 yen just to get it there. Damn you! Where are Goro and his brother? l got it! Thanks, Rokuro. The robot has arrived at Lake Kitayama. lt's standing by. - Roger that. The robot's creator and his little brother are en route. Roger. The geothermal transport elevator is ascending through the fissure in Lake Kitayama. Where are you taking them? Seatopia, the underwater kingdom. - Seatopia? - That's right. Three million years ago... the continent of Lemuria sank into the ocean. Fortunately, our ancestors were inside a great bubble. There they generated oxygen, created an artificial sun, and built the kingdom of Seatopia. So the legend's true! That's why our science is far more advanced than yours. Then why do you want the robot? Our numbers are few. We need a great many robots to protect ourselves from enemies who threaten our peace. So that's why you kidnapped them! Where are they? Tell me! Where are they? You better talk! ln a container truck. There, you're untied. Ouch! Goro! - Ouch! - You okay? Ground Unit One. This is Ground Unit One. This is the robotics lab. My prisoner escaped. He knows our secret. He's gone to find the robot's creator. Pursue immediately! Megalon just arrived. l'll have him attack Tokyo immediately. - Roger. This is a special news report. At 1 :03 p.m... a new monster emerged from the fissure in Lake Kitayama. lt's heading east, destroying homes and anything else in its path. This is bad! Let's dump the container into the dam and scram! Mister, that's the same as dropping it in the fissure. - No, stick to the plan! - That's crazy! Halt! Dismount! Take your positions! Goro, it stopped shaking. Goro! Watch out! What was that sound? lt's the monster! Give us a ride! - Hurry! lt's the monster! - Where's the guy in brown? We got rid of him! First lower that container. There's no time! - Please! - Screw you! Damn it! Rokuro! You all right? Goro! You okay? - Jinkawa, is that you? lsn't that Jet Jaguar? lt is! lt's Jet Jaguar! Damn it! He's under their control. lf only Jet Jaguar could go call Godzilla. - Good idea. l'll try it. - Try what? l made a supersonic controller in case computer control failed. lt's no use! - Why? lt requires a clear line of sight. Open fire! You're saying Jet Jaguar will bring Godzilla here? Yes. But isn't he being controlled via computer? Yes, but supersonic control will override it. - So it'll work? - Yes. Jet Jaguar, stop! What's going on with the robot? Head to Monster lsland. Bring Godzilla here at once. We have a problem. The surface dwellers regained control of the robot. What's he doing? Seems he's going to seek Godzilla's help. l see. Stand by where you are. Wait for a chance to regain control. Roger! Contact M Space Hunter Nebula and ask for Gigan's help. Send the message via Easter lsland. lt's behaving erratically. lt lost its guide. Over there! Anyone here? Hello? Hello? Maybe they evacuated. - Looks that way. We'll just have to borrow this. - Let's do it. - Okay. You jerk! Hey! Rokuro! Goro! - You took care of him! - Yeah. And Jet Jaguar went to get Godzilla. Really? The monster's coming. Let's get out of here. - What about him? - Let's carry him. Quit struggling! Forget it. Let's go! A message has come in from M Space Hunter Nebula. "Space monster Gigan has set out." Jet Jaguar! Jet Jaguar's back! - Really? Look! All right! Jet Jaguar! Ask him if he found Godzilla. What? That's strange. He flew off on his own. Jet Jaguar, come down! Jet Jaguar, come back! lt doesn't work anymore. Something must have stimulated his brain... and given him a will of his own. A will of his own? So he'll act on his own now... without your orders? - You still want to do this? - l know it's risky. But l built Jet Jaguar with my own hands. lf anything happens to him... l get it. You're his father. Can't argue with that. Look how huge Jet Jaguar is. l can't believe it. He decided he had to fight Megalon until Godzilla got here. His determination made him grow that big. lt's Gigan! - Whose side is it on? - Megalon's, of course. lt's Godzilla! Godzilla! Geothermal demolition team... prepare to seal all surface fissures immediately. Seal all fissures! Godzilla, bye-bye! Goro. Good job, Jet Jaguar! Jet Jaguar, thank you! Jet Jaguar, come home with us. Come home with us. Come on. Okay, Jet Jaguar? Goro, use that thing. Jet Jaguar, want to come home? What's going on? With his mission accomplished, he reverted to a mindless robot. But he could turn sentient again if another battle erupts. We have to make sure it doesn't. That underwater kingdom only attacked because its peace was threatened. Hey, Jet Jaguar! A man-made robot A guardian of Earth Jet Jaguar, Jet Jaguar Well done, Jaguar Go! Go! Defend our peace Show us your amazing courage Godzilla and Jaguar Punch, punch, punch! We've got to be strong just like them! THE END
