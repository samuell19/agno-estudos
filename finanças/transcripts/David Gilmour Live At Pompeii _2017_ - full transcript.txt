Whatever it takes to break Gotta do it From the burning lake or the eastern gate You'll get through it Rattle that lock, lose those chains Rattle that lock, lose those chains Rattle that lock, lose those chains Rattle that lock Let's go do it Have it all our way Go back to where we blew it And lose our heads along the way So long sin, au revoir chaos If there's a heaven, it can wait So long sin, au revoir chaos If there's a heaven Rattle that lock Rattle that lock, lose those chains Rattle that lock Rattle that lock, lose those chains And all the other travellers Become phantoms to our eyes Furies and the revellers The Fallen angels in disguise No discord, chance or rumour Is going to interrupt this place No discord, chance or rumour To interrupt this So let's get to it It's calling like a flame Through the darkness and the night The world suspended on a golden chain No discord, chance or rumour Is going to interrupt this place No discord, chance or rumour To interrupt this Rattle that lock Rattle that lock, lose those chains Rattle that lock Rattle that lock Rattle that lock, lose those chains Faces of stone that watched from the dark As the wind swirled around and you took my arm in the park Images framed, hung high in the trees And you talked of your youth but the years had turned dry as the leaves Your lover was gone, his replacement to hand And just what the difference was, you could not understand In darkening grey we walked back through the streets Then you talked all night long of your childhood home by the sea And I, my disguise a mask chosen by you Believed every word I heard At least I think that's what I tried to do We sat on the roof, the night overflowed No more was said but I learned all I needed to know Your Hollywood smile shone a light on the past But it was the future that you held so tight to your heart As you look around this room tonight Settle in your seat and dim the lights Do you want my blood, do you want my tears What do you want What do you want from me Should I sing until I can't sing any more Play these strings until my fingers are raw You're so hard to please What do you want from me Do you think that I know something you don't know If I don't promise you the answers would you go Should I stand out in the rain Do you want me to make a daisy chain for you I'm not the one you need What do you want from me You can have anything you want You can drift, you can dream, even walk on water Anything you want You can own everything you see Sell your soul for complete control Is that really what you need You can lose yourself this night See inside there is nothing to hide Turn and face the light What do you want from me Shameless sea Aimlessly so blue Midnight-moon shines for you Still, marooned Silence drifting through Nowhere to choose Just blue... Ceaselessly Star-crossed you and me Save our souls We'll be forever blue Waves roll Lift us in blue Drift us Seep right through And colour us blue Wait for me Shameless you, the sea Soon, the Blue So soon... Soon, the Blue So soon... Something I never knew In silence I'd hear you And a boat lies waiting Still your clouds all flaming That old time easy feeling What I lost was an ocean Now I'm drifting through without you In this sad barcarolle What I lost was an ocean And I'm rolling right behind you In this sad barcarolle It rocks you like a cradle It rocks you to the core You'll sleep like a baby As it knocks at Death's door So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain. Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell? Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts? Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage? How I wish, how I wish you were here. We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year, Running over the same old ground. What have we found? The same old fears. Wish you were here. Money, get away Get a good job with more pay and you're O.K. Money, it's a gas Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash New car, caviar, four star daydream, Think I'll buy me a football team Money, get back I'm all right, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack. Money, it's a hit Don't give me that do goody good bullshit I'm in the high-fidelity first-class traveling set And I think I need a Learjet Money, it's a crime Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie Money, so they say Is the root of all evil today But if you ask for a rise it's no surprise that they're giving none away Home and done it's just begun His heart weighs more, more than it ever did before What has he done? God help my son Hey, stay a while, I'll stay up No sugar is enough to bring sweetness to his cup I know sorrow tastes the same on any tongue How was I to feel it When a gun was in my hands And I'd waited for so long How was I to see straight In the dust and blinding sun Just a pair of boots on the ground On the screen the young men die The children cry in the rubble of their lives What has he done? God help my son Hey, stay a while, I'll stay up The volume pumped right up but not enough to drown it out I hear "Mama" sounds the same in any tongue How am I to see you When my faith stands in the way And the wailing is long done How am I to know you With a joystick in my hand When the call to arms has come Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young In a world of magnets and miracles Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary The ringing of the division bell had begun Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway Do they still meet there by the Cut There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps Running before time took our dreams away Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground To a life consumed by slow decay The grass was greener The light was brighter With friends surrounded The nights of wonder Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again Dragged by the force of some inner tide At a higher altitude with flag unfurled We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world Encumbered forever by desire and ambition There's a hunger still unsatisfied Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon Though down this road we've been so many times The grass was greener The light was brighter The taste was sweeter The nights of wonder With friends surrounded The dawn mist glowing The water flowing The endless river Forever and ever
