Have good good good good day day day day have a good day May you have a good day. Have a good day May you have a good day. Hurt hurt heart heart you hurt my heart you hurt my heart should shit "Not"shit". That's a dirty word." Should should you should be sorry to me you should "What-what"to me"?" You you should should be be sorry sorry to me "Oh, that"to me"." It means: You should apologize to me. I need to learn that one. I keep getting screwed lately. But only sorry is not enough. But only... enough Take your pills. Not now. "If you don't take them now, you'll forget." I guarantee you... he won't last three days. What's your name again? Wang Li. Teacher Wang. You didn't even read the company reports. Lan-lan! Look after Uncle for me... Only three cigarettes a day. Call me if he misbehaves. You really are something! Do whatever you feel like. "All that work at the office," but you waste time studying this stuff. I need it for business. Lots of foreign clients. Have a good day Lan-lan... come. I hear your cousin is in town? Uh. Why not pay him a visit? Take the afternoon off. Here's a hundred. Take a taxi there and back. Don't tell Auntie I gave it to you. Go. "Enough?" "No, no. It's English:" "Come is"come". Go is"Go"." "Now"go"." "Thanks, Uncle!" You said you wouldn't touch me. You're bad. I'm your tutor. "I know, but I like you so much!" Do you say that to every woman? Hurry up! Stop it! C'mon. Not so rough! Don't blame me. It's your fault for being so pretty! Let go. Your fault after all. Are you crazy? You're ripping my clothes! You're ripping my clothes! "Look, my button came off. I'll have to sew it." It's in our best interests if you don't sue me. Don't be too rough. What if your wife finds us? She's not home. Too heavy. Don't worry. Take it easy. Shall we chat? Don't be afraid. He doesn't have a weapon. Just a camera. Is it clear? Let me see. "Yes, extremely clear!" General Manager Liu... treating my girlfriend like this has injured me deeply. You hurt my heart. I just taught you that one. I had no idea you were a couple. I apologize to both of you. You... should... sorry to me. What? I should apologize to you? You got it wrong. You should say: I am so sorry. I am so sorry. But... only... sorry... is... not... enough. Do you understand? Yes. An apology alone won't do. Right. Then what do you want from me? From an artistic point of view... you're right: It really has no value. But as a documentary... in terms of clarity and content it's more than enough to shock your wife's fragile nerves. You should purchase it. This is extortion! Take it easy! Extortion... You're correct. It is extortion! What the hell do you want? I have no cash here! C'mon... C'mon! All he wants is that car. The undersigned owes Mr. Wang and Ms. Wang... one million RMB. "After mutually amicable negotiations," I irrevocably agree to repay said debt... "with one BMW." Here, here..." Give us a fingerprint signature. - Press down here. - C'mon. What are you doing? "Oh, my..." Come back here! You hit him! So disgraceful! "Oh, no..." Wow. Look how red it is. Does it hurt? What is your job here? A movie star? We don't need salutes. We need security! Responsibility! Got it? You don't check nice cars? Nice cars come and go as they please? You think criminals don't drive nice cars?! You're laughing? Stop it! Totally useless. What's wrong? Nothing. I can't go on... This is the last time. "After we sell the car, let's call it quits." I want a normal life. Must be altitude sickness. You're babbling. I want to go in and pray. "After we fence this, we'll have all the fun you want." This isn't about fun! I just want to earnestly pray for once. "Not bad, eh?" Even in a place like this? Don't you fear retribution? You'd be better off praying to me. I am a buddha. Watch your mouth. You really think you're pious? You're just a female wolf. And I'm a male wolf. Too late to change now. Shut up! You can't turn over a new leaf. Not even in your next life! I told you to shut up! Hear me?! Stop it! I told you to shut up! Stop the car! Stop! Buddha can't help you! Can you please stop talking! I want to get out. Stop! "I said, don't touch me!" There's a truck up ahead! Trying to get us killed? You've been so weird lately! What's gotten into you! From now on I want nothing to do with you. We're finished. Alright. Get out of here. Get out? We haven't divided the money yet. I want my share. What share? I risked my life for that money! You risked your life? If I hadn't distracted... "the cops in Changsha, where would you be now?" "And the job in Yunnan," If I hadn't traded myself... Give me a break! I would have fought them! By yourself? - Shut up. With your hands tied to the table? For what son of a bitch did I have this done to me?! Did the dogs eat your conscience? I knew it would come to this. "It's all about the money, right?" You're right. There's only the money. What's there between us besides money? I just want my share. Don't do this. I apologize! Fuck off! Fine. "Uncle, how old am I?" Why do you want to know? I just do. 16 when you came here... been here 5 years... that makes you about 21. Why? Nothing. Uncle. How much savings do I have? Why? I want to know. Accountant! What? How much savings does Root have? Fifty or sixty thousand. Is it fifty or sixty? Sixty. Withdraw it for me. What for? "I want to go home, build a house, find a wife." "Okay, okay..." I'll take you home to find a wife at New Year's. What's your name? I don't have a proper name. "Back home, they just call me Root." You're not a local. I'm from Hebei. Came here to repair monasteries. You must have accumulated many spiritual merits. I'm an orphan. Ever since I can remember I earned my keep with the monastery carpenters. It's an ancient craft in our village. Thank you. Go on. Take it. Go. I didn't give you a lift for money. What's this? A talisman. A lama gave it to me. It wards off evil. Eating already? I withdrew it. Root. Root! Root! I withdrew your money for you. Have a look. Sixty thousand. - Wire it for him "If you wire it, then..." "60,000 becomes 59,400." They charge a fee. 600 yuan? "60,000 means 600 in postal fees?" Those are government regulations. I could buy a donkey for that! "But save 600 and you might lose 60,000. Better to wire it." There are thieves everywhere. - It'll get stolen. "Not just stolen, but robbed!" Can't be that many thieves! Listen to your uncle. Better to wire it home. 60k is lighter than a brick! I can't just carry it home? So stubborn! Fugui! Yulan! "Everyone, come here!" You might never see me again! I'm going home to get married! These past five years... when everyone went home for New Year's... you always kept me company. I'm going home. I won't be able to see you anymore! Meeting adjourned! You're not wearing your cap. It looks better on you. A few words before we leave. After we board... No one is to disturb Uncle Lee without my permission. We have to guarantee his rest. And you... Leave Uncle Lee in peace. Don't visit his compartment all the time. He's big enough to forgive you. But you need to shape up. Are you listening to me? "Stop picking on me, okay?" Four Eyes always does it! Why not criticize him? Did I step on your tail? I've said it a hundred times: We need teamwork. Always seek the best in others. The purpose of this trip... is to train our team in a real situation... and to test our new members. Those deserving special praise are... Little Leaf... and Four Eyes. Although new to the trade... "They try hard. They've not only surpassed themselves," but even the old guard here. Uncle Lee... "No matter what happens, I'll do my very best!" In our work together I hope you will all strive to keep reaching new heights. A gold watch! Still sick from the altitude? Sorry. We said we would split up after we sold the car. So why are you following me? "Believe me, from now on..." I won't ever leave your side again. Come on. Be carefull. Would you guys shut up! It's annoying! I didn't steal this 60k! I worked hard for it! Fair and square! Who'd steal it? Which of you is a thief? Stand up and let us have a look! Who's a thief! See? No thieves. Stop yelling. They think its funny! "Big Sister, what are you doing here? What about you" I'm going home. Have you ever seen a thief? I've seen one. What's a thief look like? Don't mind him. He's joking. Just stick close to me. You know that girl? "She's a devout Buddhist He's in your hands, miss." Alright. Do me a favor and watch his luggage for him. - Alright. "Uncle, you guys go home." When did you meet dumbo? - You stay clear of him I should teach him a lesson. The kid has no eyes for thieves. That pisses me off. "Big Brother, Big Sister!" There's a seat here! He's practically adopted us. You sit next to him and I'll sit across from him. "C'mon, have a seat!" The table is too dirty! "Here, make a space." Hey... What are you looking at? There's an empty seat over there. Professor Han... There's a seat here. Take the window seat. - Okay I'm very old... My legs aren't so good. Make a space for me... Sorry. "This seat is taken. Sorry, sorry..." "-Grandpa, sit here! Mind your own business." "Here, I'll help you find a spot." There are none. Sure there are. My legs aren't so good anymore... Where's the seat? You're a good actor. Listen up... You and I are the same. Wolves. That lamb belongs to me. What? I don't understand... Cut the crap! Your performance isn't bad. Playing lame... Like this... And this... Drag the leg a bit more. Announcing you had money to all those people... Probably did invite some thieves. That old man is a thief? Won't admit your own stupidity. You think thieves carry signs? You're just like the villagers. You think people are all bad! You can't judge a book by its cover. "Harbor no malice, but don't be a fool." Just be more careful. Look at me. Do I look like a thief? You're no thief. You just look down on me. Look at her... Look! She seem like a thief? What are you staring at? You look kinder all the time. A real saint. She is a good person! "Big Sis, if you were a thief I'd gouge my eyes out!" I mean it! No one's a thief to you. "To you, everyone is a bodhisattva." Those two eyes in your head are useless. Sooner you cut them out the better! My home is in the mountains. In our village... if you found cow dung in the road. But forgot your manure basket. You'd get a rock and draw a line around it. "A few days later, it would still be there." "Seeing that line, others would know the dung had an owner." In the highlands I stayed behind... every holiday to guard the worksite. No one to talk to. Just the wolves. They don't scare me. They never hurt me. I've left the highlands with so many people to talk to... If wolves wouldn't hurt me I can't believe people would. People can't be worse than wolves. Big Brother... Am I right? Uncle Lee That worker's asking for it. I say we pinch him quickly so the brothers don't get distracted by the scent of fresh meat and lose their cool. You've lost your cool. What smells sweet to the nose can be poison to the mouth. Pass this order along... Five words: No hunting on this train. We've got a brainless lamb... snuggled between two thieving wolves. Uncle Lee... "If we don't fleece him, they'll be getting too sweet a deal." You're obsessed with small change! You'll never do big things! This is between me and Uncle! Go mind your own business! You have no sense of respect! When I joined the brotherhood you were just a schoolgirl. Stop pulling seniority on me! Let's see how tough you are. Think I couldn't kick your ass? You're a dead woman! You two are making me jealous. What's the point of showing off to your brother? No respect for your elders. Number Two... I keep telling you... Pettiness doesn't win loyalty. "To be the boss, you must be tolerant." I know. Leaf. Come massage my shoulders. I'm going out. "I am, however, curious to see what" those love birds are made of. This century's most expensive commodity is... talent! Excuse me. Oops! Did you scald yourself? What happened? See if the kid was scalded. Don't move! It's okay. Don't move. Root! Watch where you're going! It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Just a minute. Go sit with Sister. Wang Li. See if he scalded himself. I'm okay. But you're all red! I bumped into his hot water. Cop. - Look. Coming through. Take care of your brother It's a long trip. Same goes for you. I think his eyesight is bad. Keeps running into walls. I know. Thanks. "Big Brother, Big Sister Are you hungry?" I've got boiled eggs in my bag. Did that 60k get wet? Nope. It's wrapped in oilpaper. It's waterproof. Stop showing off. Put it away. Does it hurt? - Let's put some cream on it. - It's fine. But it's all red. I'll do it myself. Don't be so feudalistic. Lift your head. Feel better? A silver lining in every cloud. Feel good? I feel good just watching. Sister has a bodhisattva's heart. Really? How come I never knew that? No one cares that I cut my hand. Where? And here. Look. Get out of here! Bxlunches! Boxlunches here! 10 yuan and 5 yuan. My wallet? I lost my wallet. Really? You had it before we boarded when you bought water. Must have been stolen. Keep looking. Maybe you dropped it? Where could I drop it? A thief must have nabbed it. He's probably right here in this car. Just your bad luck. A lost purse averts calamity Better pray I don't catch him. He won't get off easy. There's no shortage of thieves here. "Do your best, Sherlock." To tell you the truth. You should be alarmed all the time. "Big Brother, Big Sister..." "Don't be upset, I've got eggs here!" This way please. Have a seat. - Thanks Waitress! What's the deal? Two of our dishes haven't come yet. Just a moment. I'll check on it right away. Hurry it up! Allow me to introduce myself. "Surname Hu, given name Lee. Hu Lee." "As a small courtesy," the brotherhood calls me Uncle Lee. From whence does this immortal hail? I'm not immortal. Just a friendless ghost passing through. Forgive me. "You see that, punk?" Uncle Lee just peeled a raw egg. I'd like us to be friends. Join me for a chat in my compartment? Different strokes for different folks. Ghosts with different destinations should take separate paths. "The dumb kid's cash is surnamed "Wang"." I'll call you Uncle Lee... if you grant me some face. "Don't worry, brother..." Uncle Lee doesn't work trains. I've already given the order: No hunting on this train. That lamb is all yours. I presume... those two gentlemen are your brothers? Just here dining with me. "They eat your food, but don't obey your orders." What do you mean? "While you staked out your pasture, they were penning the lambs." Is that so? "Evidently, the lamb escaped, and my men..." got bit by a shepherd dog. Shepherd dog? Not at all. Just a hungry wolf. Any paws in my rice bowl... and they get cut off. I cast my gaze toward the moon... yet the moon shines on the gutter. An organization without discipline! Face me. Turn around! You disobey me? Yes. What did you say? I didn't hear you. Yes. Louder. I couldn't hear. Yes! Number Two... tell him the consequences for disobeying me. Chop a finger off... Still feel like being fresh? Or snap your neck... I don't care what you do to me. I have nothing to apologize for. Oh? Should I apologize to you? Uncle Lee... "He's new, doesn't know the rules." Give him a break. Admit your mistake and beg forgiveness. I was just acting on Uncle's orders. What did I do wrong? Who gave you my orders? Number Two said you ordered me to do it! That's bullshit! Say it again and I'll beat you myself! Impudence! Kneel down! Continue. Number Two said you wanted to test the love birds. So I inspected the goods. Otherwise I wouldn't... Big Brother. It's your turn! The bathroom's free! Big Brother? What's wrong? What are you so sad? Say something? What is it? Tell me what's wrong! What is it? "Your Big Sis, she..." "She's a real saint, isn't she?" So cheerful all the time? But she doesn't know... she doesn't have long to live. What disease does she have? Can it be cured? It's terminal. "What's a"terminal"?" She's dying and there'snothing we can do. It's hopeless! Really? You're just giving up? I was taking her to Beijing for treatment. But... But I don't have the money. How much does it cost? A lot. A lot... I'll never earn so much in my entire life. Your big brother is useless. I wish I could sell myself. Listen to me: You can't let her know. Promise me. We have to keep her happy for however long she has left. Understand? A real man shouldn't cry! Uncle Lee. There are no outsiders here. I've been with you five years. Served you tirelessly on the front lines loyal and devoted. "I'm not perfect, but I gave it my all." Ever since you met this girl Leaf... you've been playing favorites. Am I wrong? On such a long trip you don't allow us to hunt. But the girl is free to prowl. Your motives are clear. To make her look good and establish her authority. So she can take over some day. We're all unhappy about it. Uncle Lee... Leaf didn't build your kingdom. "It was built by our blood, sweat and tears." "If you keep treating her like this, I won't stand for it!" "Anyhow, I've shown you my cards." I know the rules. Do it! Where'd you go? Not that. Just hearing some village stories. Root... What did he say to you? Look at me! Nothing. Big Sister... Want to hear a joke from our village? Okay. I forgot it. How about I sing a village song for you? Runaway children wander the world. No good clothes to wear no good cigarettes to smoke. "Work always hard to find, never easy to do." Tears in my heart... Sweat on my face. The moon is round again... Another year passes away. "The wandering children sleep not," longing for mother and father so far... Why'd you stop? I don't sing well. Your voice is much better. Oh... Such sweet words! Not as dumb as I thought. Big Brother. Come over here. Big Brother. "Take this 5,000 yuan for Big Sister's treatment." What are you doing? What about your wife? I did the math: "30k for the house," two farm animals with a cart is 10k. Another ten for gifts... That leaves 10k. "The wedding party, a TV..." and bedding. But you'll have nothing left! "I thought it over, I'll buy the TV later." I appreciate your intentions... but I can't take your money. Don't say anymore. Big Sister and I were fated to meet. No. I won't take it. "You must take this 5,000." I know it's not much. What the hell did you do? He was fine just now. I didn't steal it! Your idiot brother insisted I take it! He forced me to! Why would he give you money? I didn't say anything Just that you were terminally ill. You're evil! I didn't steal it from him! "Truth be told," I wanted to see if he is a real moron or just pretending. Apparently he's a real moron. I'll tell you the truth too: I liked Root from the moment I first saw him. He's no ordinary person. And another thing: I'm adopting him as my brother! It's fate! Anyone who touches him does it over my dead body! You only prayed to Buddha once. Don't get fanatical. Newspapers and Magazines... I'm adopting you as my brother. Okay? He said I couldn't tell you... "-that you had "terminal". - He was joking!" He loves to play pranks. I'm perfectly healthy. But... I appreciate your kindness. Put it away. But Big Brother was crying. Why would he lie to me? You're too honest. You can't believe everything people say. He knows I like you. He just wanted to see if you really cared. I do. "Then, I'm adopting you as my little brother." "When you get married," I'll be in the groom's party. Do it! I've lost the will of the people. The team will be hard to lead. That's because your too soft. This isn't like you. Cutting his finger off would be easy. But once you lose the will of the people you're a lonely king in an empty castle. That kid is the cause of all the trouble. No wonder the boys are so anxious. Truly would be unprofessional not to poach him. I think... you should do the job. And give Mr. Wang a lesson while you're at it. A good general is worth a thousand troops. "Who knows me, understand my needs." "I am a mystery to he who knows me not." Fire! It's on fire! Get a fire extinguisher! "Root, stay put!" "Never mind, just stay there." "Don't go, Root!" Root! "Root, where are you?" Come here! I told you to stay put! - But there was a fire! - What if you got burned! What about everyone else?! Out of the way! Coming through! It's out already! It never caught fire. Just burned a small hole. It didn't ignite. Just made a lot of smoke. It's alright now. Stay here and watch your bag. I'm going to find your brother. Were you smoking? No. I quit smoking ten years ago! What are you doing? - Sorry. - That hurt! Watch it! I'm talking to you! Sorry isn't good enough! Why'd you pull me? "Hey, I'm talking to you!" What's with you! You sure got pregnant fast. - What are you? - None of your damn business! Want a caesarean? See if you're a human or a ghost. "Either way, you're finished!" Such a slim waist. Such soft legs. Why rob dogs and chickens when you can steal people? This isn't your home. Show some decorum. Addicted? I'll return the money... but the man... belongs to me. Just because of this? Don't be ungrateful. You really think I like you? The one who finds you interesting is Uncle Lee. What are you doing here? - And you? There was trouble. - What trouble Tell you later. Did you see a pregnant woman? Yes. She took Root's money. You must help me. And you call yourself a thief? "After all this time, that money's gone by now." And you're still chasing?! I can't bear to wake him and have him find out. What can we do? We're outnumbered. You did your best. "I have a bad feeling. We should get off," get far away from this troubled journey. Smell something? The scent of a cop. You think I'm police? Wrongly accusing an innocent person! You're certainly no angel. With skills like his why use your chicken to lay eggs? You think Wang is a cop? Smells like a wolf with a hint of human. Don't go back. Let's get off at the next stop. It was the first time I've wanted to do a good deed. "C'mon, it's the intention that counts." Having his money stolen was a good deed. He'll learn that in this world good people are a minority. "Anyhow, we didn't steal it." Not as smart as we used to be. Uncle Lee. The birds took flight. The meat? They ate it. The lamb? Still in the pen. Follow them. Go We're just going to leave him? Maybe we should bring him with us. No need. We just need his money. You have it? "No, you do." You stole his money! No I didn't. She stole his money and I stole hers. "Then, I should thank you for him!" "If you dare return it," don't blame me for getting hostile. Taking that money is like killing him. On the contrary! I'm giving him a new life. In all our years together... Root is the only person we've met who trusts people and has no defenses. Then he needs a lesson. Why should he trust them? Why should he not suffer? Why? Because he's pure? He's stupid! You want him to be stupid forever? Life demands that he wise up! "As a human being" to hide the truth about life from him... that's deceiving him. You know what's evil? Deception is evil. You're full of shit! No I'm not. Listen up: "Even if you return the money, he'll never get it home!" Let's do this: You return it to him. I'll give you 60k from the bank card. "That's a fair trade, isn't it?" Who the hell are you? You're bargaining with me? Are you crazy? I can't take this anymore. You really think you're a bodhisattva? You're a thief. "10,000 good deeds won't change that." You can't reverse the verdict of your life. Are you done? "No, I'm not!" The verdict is already in and in the next life too! Take it all! Our accounts are clear! Why! Why! Why are you doing this? Why? Tell me. Because I have your child in my belly. I want to improve its karma. Is that alright? "Hey, there are you are!" Get lost! You've had a fight. Your little brother got off too. He's waiting for you over there. You kept this from me. You don't think I'm fit to be a father. You're not. Neither am I. But I am still having this child. He won't be a thief. You can't leave. Why aren't you sleeping? That painter Uncle woke me up. He said you were down here Said I should get some air too. Give me an egg. Watching you eat got me hungry. Sister. Why'd you throw it away? I'll show you a magic trick. The egg is now in your pocket. "No, it's not." You're lying. Then it's in my pocket. But I saw you throw it really far. How did it get there? That's nothing. I'll show you another one. What? I'll move the things from your bag into mine. No way! No? See if anything's missing. My money's gone! It's gone! Is there something new in your bag? Those are my tissues. And your money is in my bag. Look for yourself. Is it there? Nope. No? Yes. I tricked you. How did you do it? Just a little magic trick. The train ride's too boring. All aboard! All aboard! Let's go. Get aboard. "Uncle, you missed it!" My sister did a magic trick. Lots of people do magic tricks. Sometimes things made to disappear come back to you. And sometimes they don't. All aboard! All aboard! It's time. All aboard! All aboard! It's time. What does this talisman do? Are you troubled? Yes. The lama in the monastery said... troubled people have demons in their heart. The talisman subdues the demons. "Gets rid of your troubles, and puts your heart at ease." You believe in demons? Yes. Then wear it. Are you troubled? Nope! I don't believe in demons! Such a cruel heart. Were going to leave without saying goodbye? I have no heart. No one wants your heart. They want your life. You forget... I'm just a ghost passing by. I lost my life long ago. A dead ghost. You wanted my life too. "I'm in a bad mood so don't piss me off." Spooking the police won't help either of us. Don't hide behind the cops. How about a test of skills? Unless you're scared. What's the winner get? And the loser? "If I win," tonight you belong to me. You do whatever I tell you. If you lose? I'll vanish from your sight. One more condition. Leave my half-wit brother alone. Deal. I'll toss this ice cube up in the air. As soon as it lands... "whoever grabs the glass first, wins." You cheated. You said it yourself... "whoever got the glass first, wins." She lost. Take her to my compartment. Don't want her embarrassing herself. Yes. Tonight you belong to me. I lost. I should be vanishing from your sight. "You lost," so you're mine tonight. "If I lose," then I disappear. You drugged me. I didn't make you drink it. You did it yourself. But you drank it too. You can't drink everything I can. Anti-pickpocket division. "If you don't mind, access the fugitive database." Take a look and see if they are on any wanted lists. It will take time. I've got hundreds of files in here. I'll have to check one at a time. We've got two groups of pickpockets. I need to find out exactly who they are. Just tell us when to make our move. - No rush. We'll wait until they all reveal themselves. I need to sleep awhile Give me your bag as a pillow. I'm here. Don't worry. Am I stupid? Dumber than Root. What the hell! You again? Haven't had enough? Just one competition left. What? Guts. You got any? Do you? There's a tunnel up ahead. "Let's see who has guts. If so, come stand next to me." The loser ducks first! I'm giving this opportunity to you. You go. Leaf lost to him. "If you win, just see what Uncle Lee says." Go on! "We have a saying" Don't tread on wind if you don't have wings. Stop flailing. You're fine. "Either drop me or save me," but cut the bullshit! Let go or not. A smartass even in the face of death. Your men don't keep their word! They're bad losers! I'm no Jackie Chan! I don't have a hundred lives! "But if I die, I'll do it without shame!" Uncle Lee... Kill him! He's too reckless! He doesn't even respect you! Uncle Lee... He dares to insult you! We'll lose face if word of this gets out. Finish him off! I'll take care of the girl myself! No! Don't! Shut up! Murder is for robbers. Killing a man for winning? "Now, that would be a real loss of face." Thanks. Wait. I saved you because you have talent. But my patience has limits. Let's decide this with a final t?te-?-t?te. Go on... "As we say in the trade," a thief loses in the blink of an eye. "You guard the kid, I'll try to withdraw his money." "If I fail, I'll leave the train." "If I succeed," the money's still yours but you belong to me. Fair enough? It's a deal. See you inside. Uncle Lee. You taught me another lesson today. Enough. We'll discuss it in our next meeting. "Four Eyes, come here." Come here. I have nothing against you... just very high expectations. You must understand the difficulty of my job. There are prizes and penalties. Let me give you a little keepsake. Got yourself into another match? Yeah. I wagered myself. "One round, winner takes all." It's the only way to get these dogs off our heels. It's my fault for getting us into this. Being a nice person is no picnic. No good deed goes unpunished. I'll finish what I started. "If things get out of hand, I'll alert the cops." You stay out of this. This is no longer your business. I won't take this lying down. I have to win this round. Attention Please! Attention Please! A passenger is seriously ill and requires a blood transfusion. We'd like to ask all passengers to carry forward the revolutionary humanitarian spirit by donating blood in the steward's car. Attention Please! Attention Please! How much blood will they take? A cup. How much blood in my body? A basin's worth. I can donate a cup then! "Big Brother, You've changed!" I'm a new person. Others have already volunteered. It will make you dizzy. I'm not afraid. The monks said: Better to save a life than build a seven-story pagoda. "You understand, it's just a donation." They don't pay you. I know that! That's why they call it a donation. "Big Brother, will you donate?" "Big Brother, give a cup too!" Okay. I guess you'll be the end of me. C'mon. Go with Big Brother. "Afterwards, we'll have a big meal in the dining car." After you. You lose. Root. I'm not going. Why not? Blood scares me. Then stop following me. Go keep Sister company. The old guy with the luggage was a plant. They switched the bag. It's all fake money. Not bad. Switched a prince for a pauper. I challenged you only because I respect you. But you didn't play fair. "Stop acting it must have been you." I can reliably inform you that... Uncle Lee is very angry. The consequences will be severe. It was switched. You think his guys did it? Could have been switched long ago. There must be another master. We've been played. You're just in time. Tieyong... Do me a favor. Position your men to Car 6 to help control the scene. But don't alert our two suspects. Do we have a match? I think it's them. The arrest warrant doesn't have a photo. Just a police sketch based on a witness' description. "The man is Wang Bo. The woman, Wang Li." - This is a robbery. - It's a robbery! Rr... rr... rr... Ro... robb... ...ery! Right! It's a robbery! Can't stand you armed robber types. No technical skills whatsoever. Everyone sit down. Sit down. It's a robbery. Are you afraid? I'm fine. Just tell me if you feel uncomfortable. All your cards. Hurry it up! Why not gave me? What's this for? Brother... Just a moment. I want to steal some beauty. IC cards... IP cards... and IQ cards. I want the passwords to all of them. "Excuse me, Mr. Robber." There are no IQ cards. Hand it over by yourself! Why not? I have an IQ. But you don't. "Well, if you gave me yours, then I'd have one!" You c-c-can't use it! "If you gave me the password, I c-c-could use it!" There is no password. "IQ is"intelligence quotient"." What's that? Hand it over. It means brains. You're thick! He's saying you have no brains. You're the one without brains. I didn't say you had no brains. He did! You said I have no brains! "I didn't say you had no brains," I said you lacked a mind. What if I take your head off! What's that in your hand? What's that in your hand?! Money. Hand it over! It's a gift for my daddy. I'm your daddy now! Take it out! Hand it over! Big Brother... He's playing with me. I told you... You think I'm stupid? This is the money they give dead people. You're not taking this seriously! No laughing! This is a robbery! You think this is funny? You know what this is? An axe. Waist... Your w-w-waist... what are you hiding there? Nothing. Feel for yourself. You'll let me feel you? Feel something? What is it? What? Tell me if you feel anything. G-g... Gun! Freeze! Police! Don't move! Stay there! Put your weapons down! Surprised? Never expected it was me! Get down! Get up! Stand up! I'm a good guy. On your feet! You! I'm no robber. I've got other business with you. And you. Get up! Cuff me. I've been arrested. "Oh, man..." You think our charade will actually fool the police? Best I could do under present circumstances. We can't wait until the next station. Number Two and Four Eyes will rat us out. Number Two knows I'm wanted for murder. "If he sells me out, he can plea bargain." You're not afraid I'll rat you out? What do we do now? Wait. We'll be at the next station soon. "Once it stops," the waiting cops will board the train. "Police, railway police and undercover agents..." They won't necessarily know each other. You take me off during the confusion. We're all clear about the particulars of the robbery. We'll need your signature. Why are you carrying so much funeral money? Bought it on the road. For what? Bribes. To bribe whom? Little ghosts along the way. Aren't you a bit young to believe in that stuff? Two ways of looking at it: "If death really is the final curtain, then this is just waste paper." But if we go to another world... ghosts there will like money too. How does that saying go? Even ghosts will work for money. Right? It's not healthy to walk around with ghosts on your mind. You're right. I plan on throwing this away. Was the kid who donated blood seated together with you? Yes. He fainted. But he's fine now. The doctor gave him sedatives. Where is he? Soft sleeper. "I wish he could sleep like this forever," and never wake up. That's easy. Have the doctor increase the dosage. He'll never wake up again. "That way, he'd never lose his faith in this world." He could live forever in his dream of a world without thieves. Stop thinking crazy thoughts. We have to get off this train. Let me properly introduce myself. I'm a cop. No need to introduce yourselves... we're all clear about who's who. He switched it. I should return this lost property. Take a seat. Let's cut to the chase: I need your help in clarifying a few matters I don't understand. You're thieves. Why protect the kid? Was it just his honesty and kindness that softened you up? "In that case, you could have just left him alone." Why incur the wrath of those gangsters? There's nothing to be ashamed of. Tell me. What were you thinking? What can we say? We lost our heads. "I'm pregnant," so I feared retribution. I did a good deed as penance. That's the truth. Sounds reasonable. I'll provide a full and fair account of that in my report. It's my duty to arrest you and bring you to justice. And that's absolutely what I'm going to do. "But to tell you the truth," what you've done... has won my respect. Really. I could have arrested you long ago. Your extortion of the BMW was... a very serious offense. But I wanted to see how your drama would play out. Protecting Root was an act of kindness I wanted to help you with. I just want to know when did you switch the money? During the fire. "All that work for a measly 60,000 yuan." Almost lost my life for it. We're as stupid as they get. Do us a favor. The money's been returned. Promise you won't let him know he was surrounded by thieves. Alright. I promise you. I retrieved my wallet myself. I won't mention in my report that you stole it. You went through our bags? Searched for evidence. I'll need to borrow this photo. Keep it. As a memento. We won't have many chances to meet again. And neither will you two. We'll be at the next station soon. Say what you've got to say to each other. I'll give you some time. We're interrogating the others now. We've notified the next station. We'll transfer them off the train once we get in. You showed your cards to those love birds? "If they didn't have records, I'd really like to let them go." "If Number Two and the guys sold you out," will you hate them? God helps those who help themselves. No loyalty at all! Loyalty? That's just a word they use in plays. Never forget... to survive in the underworld... "remember just three words: "Greatness is ruthless." Uncle Lee... I know you're a sensible person. And you won't blame me. "So, I'm really going to turn you in." Police! I'm turning myself in! Stay where you are! Against the wall! The main culprit is inside! I've already handcuffed him! I'm just an accessory! Take the hat off. Sit up. Just what drama are you two acting? I was reckless. Never thought that girl would play me. What's that old idiom? Caught in your... Whatchamacallit... Caught in your own cocoon? Right. That's it. You're a perfect example. Change his handcuffs. The key? We've reached the end of the line. We should have it... aborted as soon as possible. You'd do that? I don't want it entering the world carrying the weight of our sins. Listen to me. "If the child is safe, so will you be." "If anything happens to it," you'll pay with your life. Mr. Wang... You know me better than that. Think I fear death? He's got Root's bag! Let go of me! Let go! Don't go. I'll take care of it for you! Listen to me! I don't want our child born in a prison. Go. Don't abandon me and our child. Get out of my way. Put the bag down and I'll let you go. Out of the question. Think you can get past me? I'd like to try. No passage here? I see... "Good work, little ghost." "Can you feel it, Old ghost?" Put them on yourself. Did I ruin your appetite? No point in waiting. He's gone. Let me finish eating first. That day the god arranged our meeting I knew I saw the spring That day I missed you with expectation Not sure what was the destination That day my heart burst with fire I saw my fate turning as a tire That day you were like a smoke Holding me tight si tight That day I lost you Like a child that lost his toy That day that day stayed with me A carved memory that will ever be Root's matter is resolved. Wait for me. I'll be a father soon too. My wife eats just like you do. Worried about the baby's nutrition. "When he grows up, don't hide the truth from him." Tell him exactly who his father was. Nothing to be ashamed of. Do you know it or not The cloud must know it With it's gentle move Not to disturb Our valuable time Wind Blows the clouds away But where are you When I miss you I look up with a smile Do you know it or not
