Six pack would be nice... Yeah, that's right I want some fucking booze! I'm shaking! I'm feeling weak. I can't think. Just get me something good to drink. Fine. I'll do it. I'll fucking do it. Be reasonable I'm dyslexic. How do you expect me to pass these ones? I ain't fucking doing it! What the hell? That said 430? You got it wrong! It did didn't it? Shit! OK, I'll try as hard as I can, but if I can't do it, I can't do it! Now I know you're taking the mickey! I just want to take the time to say thank you. I know you've given me the tools to a new life. A better life. I won't...I won't disappoint- Dad it's me. If you're there pick up the phone, it's your son. Clearly not there I guess. It's probably easy to leave a message anyway. I'm sorry I haven't been in touch for quite a while. I can't actually remember the last time. Something's happened to me. I'm not the person I was. Could you try and get in touch with my old girlfriend Andrea? Mum always had the number. Be really good to talk to you. I'll try and get hold of Andrea myself but umm... I really hope you're well. And happy. You don't hug the same there's nothing to you. Like a bag of bones now. Got to admit, you do look good though. Thanks, I think. Didn't recognize your voice on the phone you sound different. Is that part of what this guy did to you? Don't know if it was a guy for sure, just assuming... And yeah, my vocabulary has been extended. You think a woman would do that? It was like a prison. That's not how a woman would do it. What do you think a woman would do exactly? Cut off your balls and sleep with your brother? I don't know! I think you threatened me with that before. I don't know who did it, I never saw anyone. Thought you were in prison or dead. Thought maybe Alan had killed you and hidden the body. Or maybe your dad had come and taken you away. Well umm... I'm here. That's a really good cup of tea by the way. I don't think Alan would have the brains. I'll wait to see if my dad manages to make contact. Are you sure your mum doesn't know anything? I called her just after you phoned, just to make sure. She's heard nothing from your dad since your mum passed. No one has. Listen, I know you've moved on. Understandably so. And I know I used to ask you for a lot of favours. I need to ask you of another one. Can I stay here? For a few days. On the couch. Just until I get myself sorted? And the police, they don't have anywhere you can stay for the night? Or the council? Unless it's a cell, I doubt it. And I've had too much enclosed space to be honest. Like I said on the phone, the police I've been talking to don't really instil much faith in me. I don't think they believe me. Maybe it was to do with how I used to be. The old me. When we were talking, they had a folder on the desk of my past transgressions. One of them was chatting to me, the other one just kept flicking through it and nodding at his mate you know? Still, at least I got out of them that at the time I went missing there was loads of other local missing people. Like they were surprised I guessed that, you know? Instil? Transgressions? Instil means to- You do talk funny, look, of course you can stay. Barry's off shore until Tuesday he's a week on week off, but he won't like you staying though. Especially the way you look. You do look handsome. So you better get your shit together quickly alright? I'll be gone by then hopefully. I just need to remember how the hostels work again. That'll be an interesting experience. I saw Eric the other day, you know your old flat? Well after you left, he had 2, 3 guys go through it and redecorate. He had to take out 7 skipfuls of your shit you dirty old bugger! And he had to get the exterminators in to clear out the mice. You could ask him about it, once you get back on your feet. It might take a bit convincing though, But I'm sure once he sees you an speaks to you he'll be alright, and I could have a word with him for you if you like? I will ask him. That's a good idea, thank you. Ooh! Taking my advice for once, and you said thank you! Just can't believe it's you. So um, what else have I missed with you Andrea? You know me, same as always. ~So just to recap the strong west southwesterly wind has returned and with it comes storms throughout the week luckily that will dampen the high pollen count right down and all those pesky insects we've been seeing so much of in the air will soon disappear~ And Hiro with the forecast there, thanks for that more weather updates in an hour. Right now we are back with 14, or that's what his captors called him with this incredible story of incarceration and what would you call it, forced dieting? I think of it as a umm.. an involuntary rehabilitation yes. Forced rehab guys, I know a few celebs who could do with a sentence or two, but seriously though, a rehab though a tough thing to go through is considered a good thing, Is that how you see your time spent in "The Cell?" Well that's quite a contemplative question. Oh I do try. I've been released for about three months now, I've gotten myself a job, first one in over a decade. I've kept the weight down and I haven't fallen off the wagon as yet. No alcohol for him. Yes... I've used the skills I learned on the inside to... help me improve my life going forwards. It was a roller coaster of emotions though... I was scared, I hated being trapped, I couldn't believe that someone could do this to me, to anyone, but then my mind changed. For the longest time I felt that it was a fine thing to be in there. I started to enjoy the results of the exercise and the dieting, learning the general knowledge was quite an exciting thing Perhaps I had succumbed to a bit of what they call Stockholm Syndrome, even though I'd never met my captors in person. He never saw them once. But the important thing for your listeners to take away is that what they did to me was wrong. Illegal in fact, it was wrong against every level of my basic human rights if this was the war it would be against the Geneva Convention this would be a war crime. Now don't forget that whoever did this is still out there, could still be doing this to someone to anyone. Kidnapping is illegal, just ask my ex-wife, I'm glad you brought up the Geneva Convention, as I'd like to think of my entire first marriage as a war crime. What are our basic human rights? What are the basic human rights? Hang on, it's meant to be me asking the questions. They took away my free choice, they made me statistically healthy, and with all the parameters they used to measure health, it was average or good even. Well then surely it proves this whole process was a helpful one? You wouldn't want to go back to the way it was would you? Not entirely no, but just because I wouldn't be as big as I was then or lay around drinking wine in my flat all day then it doesn't mean that that I want to be how they want me to be I feel like I've lost my identity, maybe I chose to be fat back then, maybe I would choose to be so now but it has to be my choice. As I said, I can't relate to my old girlfriend as much, or any of my old friends, anyone I grew up with. I sure as hell can't relate to anyone I've met since I was released. There's not exactly a support group for this you know? 15 years in regional radio, I can tell you there's a support group for just about everything, believe me. There really isn't. The police are no closer to finding out who did this, they have no idea if someone else is out there suffering the same fate. They can guess through psychological profiling that this was conceived by a man, but they have no idea whether it was somebody working alone or not, they gauged through the extensive testing that I went through that this person thought that I needed a higher level of education to get a job and from that that he can gauge that this person is of a certain age because they have no understanding about that the drones or autonomous driving and the advances in technology we have means that people could no longer work the hours that they used to work and it's with this- But I digress- You say about finding the suspect or suspects even, but you haven't got much to go on have you? After all you were unconscious when you were abducted, is that right? Yes. From alcohol, is that right? Yes, but it wasn't because of the- Then you spend two years disappeared and miraculously reappear in the middle of town out of nowhere having been unconscious again..? There were vents in the cell, I was gassed regularly for periodical haircuts and clipping of nails and so on. Well that's terrible and gross, I can't imagine being inspected that way, their hands must have been... All over you. Yeah, I try not to think of that. When you reappeared you said you had some printouts with you? Yes it was the results of tests that I went through while I was in there. I think whoever did this wanted me to repeat it again and again and again like some kind of mantra. I was so disorientated that I threw it in the waste bin. When I realized my mistake, it was too late. So the best most vital evidence you had and you threw it away. There could have been fingerprints or DNA on that paper who knows? We'll never know now. I'm pretty sure there was no trace of anything I mean there was nothing on my clothes or on me- Well I guess we'll never know the mystery of the mysterious "Rehab Room." 14 thank you very much, I wish you the best of luck buddy, I really do. Thank you? Three times a day on a treadmill, that is torture... If you've been affected by this story then get in touch with us by the usual social media platforms tweet us at Southeast local talk or use the hashtag hashtag "RehabRoom." And look on the bright side at least 14 here missed England crashing out of the football again. Yes sir I've just received that. No sir I'll do it now. I'm doing that too. I won't forget. I'm writing it down now. Yes I'm very grateful for this opportunity sir. I know you took a chance on me. I will get it done sir, by the end of the week. Fuck you dolphins! 18 months, cirrhosis? I see. Look I'm sorry I wasn't there something happened to me- Auntie Christine I couldn't- Uh-huh. Yep. Yeah fine. Okay thanks bye. Hey. You got anywhere to stay? Hey. Have you got anywhere to stay? ~Gibberish~ No family around here? So no one knows you're here? You want this? I'm sorry okay? I'm just sorry. There was nothing that I could do. I had no choice. Someone will come for you. Someone will. Shit! I hope that was 14. You worthless piece of shit you can't even count right! You! You did this to me?! You've done it now, you idiot! Like you? I am nothing like you! I wouldn't want to be you either! You're in trouble now. You should have done as you were told. Good luck idiot. Wait I just want some information. You'll get nothing from me, except here's what you did wrong: Number one: You're here when you're not supposed to be. Number two: She's conscious when she's not supposed to be meaning she's seen my face when she's not meant to have seen my face! Number three: You attacked me? Are you crazy?! Like I said, good luck idiot! Zero zero watches everything we do. No! Do it you worthless piece of shit! Fucking do it! Do it! Come on! Never mind then. Give me a hit man? I need that dope! Kill me. Just fucking kill me. Stupid game! Oh... Maybe I should have tried this earlier. I'm clean! You can let me out. No? It can't be? This is not a clean place to raise a baby. You clearly want me to survive for whatever reason. You clearly want me to finish my days. Well the numbers have started going backwards, and they'll continue to go up until I see my child or I die. That's not good enough. Show me my baby. Or I'll jump! I swear I will! I'll do it! Show me my baby! Now let me out. Who's there, who are you? Are you going to do as you are told? Yes or no? You're fucking insane! Give me my ba- Are you going to do as you are told, yes or no? Is there anything I can do or say that make you stop- Are you going to do as you are told? Yes or no? Yes. 5..4..3..2..1.. Hello? Stay there, I'm coming. Bet I'm a sight for sore eyes. Hi I'm Sally. It's OK sweetheart, I don't want to hurt you. You're gonna need to hold on to that tight. You've just been dropped here haven't you? I am right aren't I? Yes... How do you know? Call it an educated guess sweetheart. You're the second one this year that's been dropped here, some of us have been keeping an eye out. Second one? There are more? People like you, you mean? Plenty. Come on, come into the house, I'll show you everything. The guards seem to like it here. Secluded and whatnot. Guess it's easy to come and go unnoticed really. I'm sorry I rather scared the last one away. Didn't get to chat to him like you. Andrea Geoffries GEOFFRIES Geoffries I'm really worried about her. None of her family have seen her for six months. She used to work for you for seven years?! Now she's just gone. Gone. Geoffries! Not all people are helpful people. Well sweetie, there is a lot of fear and excitement happening right now. I mean if anyone goes disappearing for any reason they think it's gonna happen to them, now I found one of the more helpful news reports, would you like to see it? Yes, thank you. ~Now this segment marks the 5 year anniversary of the first case of a release of a person who is said to have been kidnapped and isolated in a makeshift prison somewhere in the local area, he's said to have been kept there for more than 2 years and forced under a strict regime of diet, exercise and education in order to secure his release. Since then over a hundred people have come forward but with only 20 people confirmed by police to actually have merits to support these claims, we ask what are the facts? Here we have the confirmed cases in blue a wide net of the local area whoever is responsible clearly has a wide knowledge of the east of England. Now we add in the red dots these are the unconfirmed cases these are people who have claimed to have been abducted and abused, importantly the police have as of yet to verify these accounts. You can see they spread out much further than the region with some even as high in the UK as Scotland. We could even expand this map out further to the rest of the world where copycats have been reported across all other continents, but let's stay with the facts the tattoo is the most important link in this case all victims have been inked with a consecutive number correlating to their time spent in the cell which leads us to believe that as many as 50 people have yet to come forward or are indeed still inside this prison of unknown location. However we have to talk about the wave of support for these crimes sweeping the nation a lack of perspective by young people or a warranted talking point in Parliament, whichever it is people of all ages classes, races, religions and genders have fervently argued for and against the actions of these perpetrators many of which tattooing themselves with a number in order to show their solidarity, thus making the most important appearance of these criminals untenable as a way to catch them. I can't watch. Wow um... You mean people actually tattoo themselves like that psycho? I'm sorry, but they do, people just seem to be a bit swept up with their ideals but.. I'm more fascinated with people like you though. I mean people who have been through a long hard journey. Amazing. Just when I need my faith restoring in humanity eh? Look, that report is skewed in one direction, the vast majority of people know you've been through a terrible ordeal. There are swarms of people on the internet dedicated to their own investigations, here I'll show you. They are trying to locate the prison. They will find it eventually. They have to. Hi, are you Jessica? Hello, I'm Jessica, it's nice to meet you Pleased to meet you too. So you know about printers then? Yes I know about printers, do you know a lot about printers? no I don't that's why I've come to see you, this manuscript was attached to me when I was released- Oh! Attached to your person not like an e-mail attachment? Yeah... Exactly. Would you like to see it? Yes please! The guys in the group said it was really important there were duplicate copies? So you like collecting things? Certain porcelains, antique dolls, flotsam and jetsam. Printers and stationary, yes, I like collecting things. My mother used to limit my collection to only my own bedroom but since she moved in with Garth I've been able to spread over the entire apartment which I find ideal for my purposes. This is very interesting. Which parts interesting? It's the paper that's interesting to me not the words printed on it. What have you got to tell me? Well it has 9 duplicates, that's very unusual not many offices require 9 copies of the same paper. I suppose a large prison would maybe need it. So you think maybe the prison was bigger than we realized? Perhaps or maybe they share the copies out for some reason? Keep a watch on me probably, it's always felt like a binding contract. Only 3 printers use this type of paper 2 sorts of SONEP and 1 KIO in my 12 years and 6 months working at printer galaxy I can recall selling only a dozen of the SONEP's and 0 of the KIOs. My friend Simon still works there, I don't know what my mother has told you but he's not my boyfriend. He is sympathetic to your situation. I could ask him to email me a list of any customers whose addresses are linked to their purchases, either for additional warranty purposes trade in for old hardware or because they ordered online for in-store pickup. If you could that would be fantastically helpful Jessica. I mean he's not supposed to give out that information, that would be against the customer confidentiality agreement, but he's always breaking the rules. I remember one time he went to lunch for 2 whole hours and he had the warehouse key and no one could get in he was reprimanded for that but it is a good example of his rebellious attitude He sounds like a really helpful chap. Based on my past experiences, yes he is. He's not my boyfriend. 66,600 minutes running staring at a grey wall. 168 hours to go. That confuses the hell out of me, is that double negative? What's the correct answer? ~Explosion distant~ ~Explosion distant~ ~Explosion Close~ ~Alarm Starts~ ~Explosion~ ~Alarm Ends~ ~(Reporter) Another victim of the cell has come forward today, after more requests for information from the police. Since the discovery of the structure in Doggerland by previous abductees, total verified survivors is now up to 35, but authenticated wrist tattoos estimate that they could have been as many as 90 people abused over the last half decade. With an unknown amount of assailants still at large the mystery lives on as fear of reprisals against the numbered continue.~ ~(DJ) And that was the news, it's now 30 minutes past 4, gripping stuff still with more and more sick people out there have had themselves tattooed on the wrists on purpose declaring themselves as victims, and in favor of the guards ideals, we want to know your thoughts.
