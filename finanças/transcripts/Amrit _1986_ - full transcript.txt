'Happiness and sorrows are results of your deeds.' 'Your shadows will always follow you.' Sunita. Today, I want to give you the most valuable gift of your life. I've found grandpa and grandma. Rahul, is it true?! Have you found out where they are? Where are they? - At Pune. Can we meet them? - Why not? Will grandma recognise me after so many years? Come on, my child, have your milk. Or else how will you grow up? Why do you still feed me milk even though I've grown up? I'll give you milk until I send you off as a bride. I don't want to be a bride and leave you. My dear child, do you love me very much? Yes. More than papa and mummy. Then please drink the milk. Drink it. Virendra? Virendra? Son, have your tea. Mom? I'm sorry, darling. - Virendra, it's not just about today. Everyday, I have to drink stale tea made by your mother. Can't she work a bit harder? Mom, what is this? How often have I told you Rekha doesn't like stale tea? Can't you serve us hot tea everyday? Pick up the broken cup, or will I have to do it? Sister Rekha, how many times did I tell you? I can't drink milk without the cream? But I had put the cream in the milk. Then have I eaten the cream? Where does the cream disappear? - Ask her? Brother-in-law, good morning. Sister, good morning. Brother-in-law, would you care for a hot glass of milk? 'As I chew the betel leaf, my mind feels satisfied.' 'My family..' Mom, take more milk today. 'As I chew the betel leaf, my mind feels satisfied.' 'My family members are going out of town.' Aunt, give me your blessings. Ramcharan, how are you? - By your blessings, I'm very fine. Son, I want more milk. Can I get it? Why not? I can do anything for you. You have done a lot of favours to my family. It's such a coincidence. Sharafat Ali, the lawyer, should get this extra milk. His wife has stopped taking the milk from today. What else can she do? The lawyer doesn't get any clients these days. So.. What's the matter? Today, you look very sad. It's nothing. It's just my face. Aunt, you're.. - Mom? Are you gossiping with the milkman? This woman has a lot of patience. 'As I chew the betel leaf, my mind feels satisfied.' 'My family members are going out of town.' Grandma, let's go. I'm ready. Let's go, my child. Come on. Bye, mummy. - Bye, my child. Listen! Bring extra fruits and vegetables from the market. My friends are coming home for dinner. Grandma, look, the old man and the boy are racing. Enough! You win. - And Grandpa, you lose. Yes, son. I've become a quite old. Otherwise I would beat your dad in the race. Bye, Grandpa! Just bye will not do. Have you forgotten? - Sorry! Which candy will you have today? Buy me a mango candy today. Lallu, give me a mango candy. Grandpa, take this. I'm indebted to you, my son. But I'll repay your debt. Grandpa, please come in time to take me back. Bye, Grandma. - Bye, my child. Lallu, you make good ice-cream. I don't make it. It's made in the factory. Whatever. But it's good. If it was up to me, I'd eat all the ice-cream in the factory. If it was up to me.. - I'm leaving. I have to spend my time until the school gets dismissed. So, I'm off to Sharafat Ali's house. The old man talks too much. Why do I care about Sharafat Ali? Who is this Sharafat Ali? 'My darling, why do you lie? ' My dear wife, where is my coat? It is near the gas stove. Why didn't you burn it instead? I had tried that too. But the fire too is afraid of your black coat. This coat belongs to Sharafat Ali. Not some ordinary person. I'm getting late. Please, give me breakfast. What breakfast should I give you? We don't have any flour, lentils, rice, butter or milk. Now, the neighbours have also stopped lending us. This ancestral house is also under mortgage. Do one thing, put me up for mortgage. Then you can make arrangements for your food. I don't want any breakfast. I'll have it at Chajjuram's inn. All right? But why are you going to the court so early today? Haseena, you don't know.. ..how much I'm respected in the courts of Mumbai. Oh, great lawyer, the whole city knows that. Magistrate Badruddin has kept my case first in court today. Case? - Yes. A law suit! - Yes. Your case! And that too in the court? Sharafat Ali, may I come in? Greetings, Brother Amrit. You're already in. Now, please take a seat. Greetings, Brother. - Greetings to you, Banu. Sharafat, were you going somewhere? - Yes, I was.. If you were going about some work then don't wait. I'll sit here comfortably and gossip a lot with Banu. Brother Amrit, since you've come, to hell with the work. The work can be done later. Listen. - What? Your case is first in Badruddin's court, isn't it? Sharafat! - Yes. Have you got a case? Congratulations! Go on quickly! Forget the case. I'll get another one. But friends like you are hard to find. Haseena, make arrangements for snacks anyhow. I'm in the mood to defeat Amrit in the game of chess. Banu, I don't need any snacks. Just bring me a cup of tea. Tea? Brother, will you take tea without milk? Without milk? My dear wife, it's an insult to pour milk in tea. Right, Amrit? Absolutely! Brother Sharafat! - Ramcharan, welcome. Uncle, give me your blessings. Have a long life. Ramcharan, how are you? With your blessings, everything is fine. Have you distributed your water? Brother Sharafat, why are you making fun of me? I saw uncle coming here and I thought he'll have some tea. He's very fond of tea, isn't he? And sister-in-law has not taken milk today. So, I thought I should give the leftover milk to her. Sister-in-law, take this. - But.. I don't need any money. Take it. Thank you. My dear wife, make tea only of milk. Without milk, it feels quite dry. Doesn't it, Brother Amrit? Absolutely. You play first. - Here I go. Here is my reply. Where were you grandpa? I've been waiting since long. What can I tell you? I was engaged in a game of chess with Sharafat Ali. Let's go. Why has Rahul not come yet? Your dad must've gone somewhere to chat. He is the master of chatting. Son, don't tell your dad I had come late to pick you up. All right, Grandpa. Dad! My son has come. Good boy! Rahul, why are you late? Mummy, the school was dismissed late. Poonam, I'm hungry. Please serve food quickly. Okay. Let's have lunch. Grandpa, why don't you too have lunch with us? You have it, son. Your mom must've kept my food in my room. Son, have some vegetables. - Will you have some chicken? Delicious! It was wonderful. You too have some! - Daughter-in-law? Dad, what is it? I need a glass of water. There is no water in the tap. Anything else? Sorry, darling. Have this? - Yes, sure. Madan, my son? Dad, what is it now? I wanted to ask you since long. I'm getting a job at Rahul's school. Can I do it? What kind of a job will you do at Rahul's school? As a peon. So, you want to work as a peon in your grandson's school? How will it affect Rahul? Do you want to disgrace me in this neighbourhood? Everybody will disgrace me for making you a peon. No, my son. It's not like that. I thought I'd get some money for my expenses. Aren't we providing you enough? What do you lack over here? You get everything. If you want to work, then there's lot of work in the house. There's no need to work. Savitri, I've become lonely among family members. Very lonely. You, get down. I want to play. - No, I won't! Why will you not get down? Grandma! - Grandpa! Grandma! Grandpa! - Grandma! Rahul! - Let me go. What are you doing? - Let her go. - What are you doing? Sunita! Come on. - She's younger than you. And she's a girl. Let her play. Sunita, you've played enough. Get down. No. I'll not get down. - Sunita! Let the girl play. My grandson is very understanding. Aren't you, Rahul? No, I want to swing! What are you doing? If you swing such a small kid for so long, he'll faint. He'll faint? - Yes. Let's go. Come on. Now, you can swing. Swing as much as you want. Don't quarrel again. - Let's go. Let them play. I'm Amrit. Greetings. - And you are? I'm Kamala. Ms. Kamala, do you live around here? I live in Kamala Nivas(house) on 10th road. So, you're the house owner. But looking at you, nobody can say that. You live in simplicity. Yes, that's the sign of being a rich person. The more rich you are, the more simple you look. Just like you. Come on, let's sit down. Who all are there in your family? I have a son, my daughter-in-law and my granddaughter. I also have a son, a daughter-in-law and my grandson. All right. Do you live nearby? - Yes, on the 14th road. The number 23 bungalow belongs to my son. Are you doing some kind of business? Business? I used to do it. I had a very big business. Railway trains would stop and start on my signals. How? - I was the points-man. Points-man? Signal changer. - Yes. The railway signals were in my hands. Unless I would give the go signal, the trains couldn't move. What else can I say? After retiring, my life has changed drastically. Your sorrow is real and my sorrow is just a tale? Your blood is real and my blood is plain water? Wonderful, Uncle Kamru! Amazing! Which film's dialogue is this? 'Khoon-e-Naahak', meaning, 'The daughter of a Jew.' When I had said that dialogue.. ..the heroine of our film, Hirabai, had fainted. Really? - And our director, Dhirubhai, fell off his chair. The camera stopped working and the film was discontinued. Uncle, the vegetable has already been weighed. Forgive me. But sometimes, my acting makes me do pointless things. Uncle, sometimes is not bad. Goodbye. - Goodbye Yes, I'll come tomorrow. Ms. Kamala! Greetings. - Do you also buy vegetables from here? Yes. Let me carry your bags. - No, let them be. Give them to me. It's a man's job to carry the load. Ms. Kamala? - Yes. Do you buy the whole month's groceries in one day? No. Guests are to come home today. - Okay. Give it to me. Let's go. To save Rs.21, you didn't eat.. ..the veneration offering of the holy man. He had asked for only Rs.21, not your life. If you had eaten the ashes in the offering.. ..I would have had a child. How can he give us a child? I mean, how can he give us a child? Go ask the priest on the hill. His medicine is useless. Oh, no! Don't you have any respect for these devotees of God? Devotees of God? I have respect for the devotees of God. Greetings, Brother Amrit! Greetings to you, Brother Sharafat. Greetings, Brother. - Greetings! Banu, have a long life. Banu, this is Ms. Kamala. Her granddaughter studies in Rahul's school. Greetings. - Greetings to you. Please come to our house someday. I'll come. - Sister, please do come. Brother Sharafat, tell me something. Where had you been to so early in the morning? I had taken her to meet the priest on the hill. I'm now taking her to the shrine of Badshah, the recluse. These days, this has become my profession. Brother, make him understand. He is always making fun of my devotion. You atheist, you should also go and worship the Lord. Some good may come of it. Brother Amrit. 'I got a chance to commit a sin, but it was short-lived.' 'Such is the kindness of the Lord.' Thank you. - Shall we go? Let's go. Brother, goodbye. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Dad? Daughter-in-law, what is it? Here. Roast these breads in the oven. 'As I chew the betel leaf, my mind feels satisfied.' 'My family members are.. ' Greetings, Brother Chajju. - Greetings to you. You baldy! - Yes, boss. Give this glass of yogurt to him. Boss, is this yogurt sweet or salty? Are you going to drink it? It's insipid. Go give it! - All right. I'll leave now. Ramcharan? - Yes. Including today's milk, it makes 415 litres. You keep the account. Have I ever kept account of this? All right, goodbye. - Goodbye. Uncle, give me your blessings. Ramcharan, how are you? - I'm fine. I'm leaving. Greetings, Uncle Amrit. You have come after many days. Many days? I'd come the other day. Have you forgotten? Uncle, can I say something from my heart? If I don't meet you for a day it seems many days have passed. Chajju, it's not you, but your love speaking. Uncle, how many have you brought today? Ten. How many should I reduce? Two. - Two? Ghasita, make ten breads from these eight dough balls. And then roast them in the oven. Uncle, go have some sweets. Girdhari? - Yes. Give some sweets to uncle. Uncle, welcome. What do you want to eat? Sesame sweet balls? Girdhari, your sweet balls are not good enough. I could crush them with my teeth very easily. Then? - Today.. Sugar candy. - Sugar candy? Yes. - Right away, Uncle. Here you go. Uncle has received bitterness from his family members. He is so desperate for some sweetness. What else can he do? His son is such an idiot. He doesn't give any pocket money to him. He has to steal to have some sweets. Balwant, do you call this stealing? Even Lord Krishna would steal butter. Brother, you're right. All right, goodbye. - Goodbye. Greetings! Greetings to you. Lawyer, how come you're here? Chajjuram. I've come here to fulfil my duty towards our friendship. The municipality has sent one more notice against your inn. - What? The municipality is thinking of demolishing your inn. Lawyer, do something about this. I've already worked out a strategy. Chajjuram, I have figured it out. As soon as I received the notice.. ..I went to meet the municipal commissioner, Mr. Khare. As soon as Khare saw me, he stood up. And he said, "Why did you take the trouble to come here?" You should've called me. I told him, Khare, it is unfair to harass Chajjuram and his inn. And Khare said he was helpless. Chajjuram's inn is illegal and it should be demolished. Lawyer, I'll be doomed. Please save me! I told him, Khare, Chajjuram's inn is like Sharafat's inn. And there is still some decency left in this world. If you try to do anything to Chajjuram and his inn.. ..then I'll sue the municipality. Khare got afraid and he took back the notice to demolish your inn. You have made me happy! Thank you very much. I'm safe just because of you. You're safe and you'll flourish. Shall I order some yogurt for you? - I've already had it. Do you want cigarettes? - I just threw away one. Then how else can I serve you, sir? Yes, that reminds me. Do me a favour. - Order me, sir. Come to my house with good, tasty food for 15-20 people. We'll celebrate Eid (festival) together. Eid? - Yes. Has Eid come again? Just last week, there were Eid celebrations at your house. Do you celebrate Eid every week? Chajjuram, those were not Eid celebrations. That was your sister-in-law's birthday celebrations. Which I think of and celebrate as Eid. Right, Amrit? - What? Absolutely. Chajjuram, on Banu's birthday.. ..we had to search for the goat's meat in your rice plate. This time serve us chicken rice. After all, it's Eid. Right, Sharafat? Yes. It is Eid! Brother Amrit, let's go. - Come on. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. They always succeed to make a fool out of me. They celebrate Eid. And I have to do the fasting. "Very few people may know this."

Virendra, are you only going to offer us liquor or food as well? I'm feeling very hungry. Right away, my friend. Mom, serve the food. Rekha, don't you have a housemaid? No, we can't afford a housemaid. What are you saying? Veena, my husband gets Rs.5000 as salary. We spend Rs.500 on his mom. So, either we keep his mother or a housemaid. Friends, dinner is served. Please come. Come on, friends. Let's start. Everybody join the table. Please, have this. You, too, please. Here. Please, help yourself. Khanna, why are you being formal? - Have something. I'm having it. - Take this. Have the bread! Wonderful, Aunt! You have prepared such wonderful dinner. Have you prepared anything for dessert? But the dessert is served after the meal, isn't it? Are you teaching me table manners? Have you ever been to a party? You illiterate! Mom, you should mind your language in front of guests. Tell her to go away. Otherwise, I won't have dinner. Eat it. You won't put on weight. Brother, have you eaten? - Yes. Have some more please. - Sure. Want some more? Thank you! It's delicious! - Aren't you having anything? I have already eaten. - Have you had it? Brother, you're not having anything! You should definitely have some dessert after the meal. Sister-in-law, I have taken this sweet for the third time. Really? - And I have never had such delicious food before. Srikant, it was wonderful! The proverb is true. Only the lucky ones get such wonderful wives. You're really lucky! - Thank you, sir. Sir, Kamala has brought a lot of happiness in my life. You know I would live in a small room before. And I was working as an ordinary clerk in your office. After getting married to Kamala, my business has flourished. And I was able to build this Kamala Nivas. Uncle, have this. Kamala! - Yes. You're really the Goddess of Wealth. You'll rule wherever you live. Grandma! 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.. ..18, 19 and 20. Enough! That's enough! No, Dad. Play some more. Enough, son. Your dad is tired. Do your homework. Good boy. Okay, Dad. Your list is growing. How many people are you going to invite? Not many. Around 45. Forty five? My goodness! Arora, Malhotra, Shivadasani.. Who are they? I don't even know them. I'm inviting them so that you get to know them better. Their wives are friends from my kitty party. I'm spending Rs.3000 on your birthday. Rs.3000?! Okay, darling. Spend Rs.3000 and make me bankrupt. But be happy. Grandpa, my dad gives me nice presents on my birthday. It's dad's birthday tomorrow. What will you give him? I'll give him the world's most expensive gift. Expensive gift? What is it? It is my blessing. Rahul! Madan, congratulations on your birthday. Lord Shiva will give you a long life. May you serve your parents and make them proud in life! Here is the veneration offering. Savitri, what've you prepared today? Sweets, sweet bread and rice pudding. Wonderful, my darling! - What are you doing? Do one thing. Take Madan home. I'll reach home before you do. Savitri! Savitri, what happened to you? - Mother! What happened to you? Son.. Look after my Madan. Don't go away from him. I bind you with my oath. Mother! Dad, hurry up! I'm getting late for school. - Yes, my son. Burnt your hand, haven't you? Amrit, why are you wasting your life? You can't live such a tough life all alone. Take my advice. Get married. Madan will also get his mother back. Aunt, there can only be one mother. Savitri has gone away and so I have taken her place. I have to fulfil the promise given to her all my life. Now, I have only one ambition in life. To give Madan good education and make him a rich man. Vegetable rice, roasted chicken.. ..two vegetable dishes and salad. What's there for snacks? Thanks. For snacks, we have cheese fries! Yes. - And chicken. Wonderful! - Madan! What is it, Dad? It's your birthday tomorrow. And you know very well I present veneration offerings.. ..to Lord Shiva every year. So that he blesses you with a long life. And on the same day.. ..I offer food to the Brahmins to commemorate your mother's death. Do it this year as well. But I.. I don't have any money. If you give me Rs.50.. - Dad! Money does not grow on trees. Don't worry about my birthday and my long life. And as far as commemoration is concerned I don't have any money to spend on dead people. 'Money does not grow on trees.' 'Don't worry about my birthday and my long life.' 'And as far as commemoration is concerned..' 'I don't have any money to spend on dead people.' 'I don't have any money to spend on dead people.' Lord Shiva will be kind to your son. He'll give your son a long life, happiness and peace. My blessings are with you! Amritlal, Lord will bring peace to your dead wife's soul. Where is the bottle of Johnnie Walker?! Darling, did you also drink the scotch last night? Are you conferring upon me the title of a drunkard on my birthday? Then where is the bottle of scotch? Did you keep it in here? - Of course. I had bought it for some special guests. But what could happen to it? I hope your dad hasn't taken it. Dad? No. But I suspect him. Daughter-in-law, you are right. Dad, you? Yes, my son. I have taken the bottle of liquor. Didn't I tell you? Your father has stolen the bottle! There is a limit to disloyalty. Today, he has stolen a bottle of whisky. Tomorrow, he'll steal your wallet. And then your watch. Thieves have no respect in them. I had to do this for religion and respect. My son, congratulations on your birthday. Look, I've brought you lord Shiva's veneration offering. You're giving me veneration offering worth two penny.. ..after stealing my whisky worth Rs.200? - Madan? What have you done? You're refusing Lord's nectar for poison! You've refused lord Shiva's offerings for whisky? You're very unlucky! Please pay your respect, otherwise you'll be doomed. You have done a wrong thing by stealing in my house. Theft? Yes. I've stolen so that you may have a long life. I stole for you happiness. I stole so that your mother's soul may rest in peace. If you consider this as theft.. ..then I'll steal again and again in my life. You can steal or conduct a robbery. But you can't do such a thing in my house. Your house? You have become a rich man, haven't you? You're too arrogant about your house! All right, I'll leave you right now. I'll leave your house and never return. I'll never come back! Hear it! I'll never come back! He has insulted God! Such arrogance! Even the king of the demon was not so arrogant. Savitri, let's go. We'll not live here anymore. 'Take care of Madan.' 'Don't ever separate from him.' You're under my oath.' Madan, my son. I can't leave you. No matter how much I try, I can't stay away from you. I'm helpless. I'm helpless. A school master asked his students a question. Students, if a train is 100 yards long and.. ..it has a speed of 30 miles per hour. Then what will be my age? The students were in deep thought. But one student quickly said. Teacher, you're 40 years old. The teacher was surprised. He said to the student.. "I had deliberately asked a wrong question." "But how did you know I'm exactly 40 years old?" So, the student said to the teacher.. "My elder brother is 20 years old and he is only half-mad." Ms. Kamala, is it husband's day today? Yes. On husband's day, I would be the king for a day. At dawn, Savitri would touch my feet. And I would know it was husband's day. That's it. I was king for that day. She could not quarrel with me because it was husband's day. And I would start my rule. I would order her to make buns and potato curry.. ..and she would make it. I would order her to make rice soup and sweets. And she would make it. I knew quite well she'd return the favour the next day. She would be the queen and I would be her slave. That's it. I would make my dreams come true on husband's day. "I don't have anything more to say to you." "I don't have anything more to say to you." "My life partner, oh, my life partner."

First, go to the kitchen and serve some food for us. And then you can leave. Buck up! Thank you. Baba, can I leave now? Roasted appetiser! Bring some of it and then leave. I'm getting late. Sunita may be waiting for me. How disgusting? What kind of a woman is she? Brother, please drive faster. She has been hurt. Carefully now. Please come. Let's go. My child, why are you crying? - Grandma hasn't come. Why cry if she hasn't come? Come on, I'll take you home. Come on. Aren't you ashamed.. ..of coming home with the support of four people for such a minor injury? Just to have some rest? I'm going to pick up Sunita. If anything happens to her then I'll not let you live. Grandma! - Sunita, my dear! Grandma, what happened? Nothing, my dear. While coming to pick you up from school.. ..I met with an accident. - Your grandma is making excuses. She thinks this house is an inn. She has got used to eating everything for free. Listen carefully, if you want to eat then you'll have to work. This not an abode for widows. If Sunita had not come home safely then.. ..I'd have broken your other leg.. ..and made you to beg. 'As I chew the betel leaf, my mind feels satisfied.' Uncle, give me your blessings. Were you here to meet aunt Kamala? Ramcharan, is Ms. Kamala the owner of this house? Uncle, she used to be. Times have changed. There was a time when aunt Kamala was respected here. I have seen it with my own eyes. I was a small boy.. ..when I would come to Kamala Nivas with my dad to deliver milk. Aunt would smile a lot then. At times my dad would say to her madam.. "Don't smile so much.. ..someone's evil eyes will be cast upon your happiness." You know what she would say? She would say, "Shivprasad, why should I not laugh?" "Laughter is God's gift to us." And now, I long to see a smile on her face. Really some evil eyes have influenced her happiness. Uncle, prosperity has gone, only memories have remained. "There is so much sorrow in this world." "If compared, my sorrow is very minimal." "There is so much sorrow in this world." "If compared, my sorrow is very minimal." "After seeing peoples' sorrows." "I have forgotten my sorrow." "There is so much sorrow in this world." "If compared, my sorrow is very minimal." "After seeing peoples' sorrows." "I have forgotten my sorrow." "There is so much sorrow in this world." "If compared, my sorrow is very minimal." "Only one in a million may be happy." "Someone cries in someone's grief." "Someone cries in someone's grief." "Someone cries in someone's grief." "Someone cries in someone's grief." "Such condition is in every home." "If compared, my sorrow is very minimal." "There is so much sorrow in this world." "If compared, my sorrow is very minimal." Listen, where are you? My dear wife, I'm in the bathroom. You're always in the bathroom, aren't you? Get out quickly! Why? Has a client come to meet me? Is the client crazy.. ..to ignore all the other lawyers in the city.. ..and come to you to commit suicide? God! - Haseena.. I'll always rue the fact that.. ..you never appreciated my legal expertise. I swear by the Lord, I'll worship you. Just give me a child. What? Today, again are you going to insist for a child? Haseena, I have explained to you so many times that.. ..it is our fate not to have a child. I have the means to change our fate. Look at this. This amulet. After a lot of requesting.. ..the priest at Saki Naka has given it to me. Tie it on your right arm.. ..and by the grace of God, we'll have a child within a year. That's what the priest said. This house will be in darkness. I'm saying so. Listen, don't disrespect the priest. We'll be doomed! Whatever he says, happens. Let me tie it to you. - Haseena.. ..I don't believe such priests and holy men. I even have my doubts on the existence of God. - Oh, God! No. Because He has not yet helped a talented lawyer like me. So, you'll not tie this amulet? - Absolutely not! It's disgusting! All right. I'll not cook any food until you tie this amulet. My dear wife, we don't eat food that often. Banu, why you're behaving so decently with Sharafat Ali? Greetings. - My salutations to you, brother Amrit. Brother Amrit, the problem is that she wants me to.. ..tie an amulet which will give us a child around my arm. And I'm trying to explain to her that.. ..amulets don't give us children. Brother, he has become an atheist. Become? He does not believe in Lord's kindness. Banu, the day Sharafat Ali.. ..wins a case in the court of law or of life.. ..he'll automatically start to believe in the kindness of Lord. Amen! Brother Amrit, on that note let's play a game of chess. No, Sharafat, I'm not in the mood today. What's the matter? Did something happen in your house? I'm used to the taunts of my family members. But today, after seeing another helpless.. ..and destitute being harassed.. ..I feel like revolting. Sister, did you call me? Brother Baba, please pay the electricity and telephone bills. And buy all the materials you need at home yourself. I don't trust mom. - You do trust me, don't you? Sister, you're leaving me here alone.. ..and going on a holiday for a month. Let this money be with me. I can use some. Right, Brother-in-law? 'We are made for each other, do you understand? ' Thank you. Come on, darling. We're getting so late. I'm ready. My child, take care of yourself over there. Okay? Grandma, you too take care of yourself. All right? Yes. - Sunita! Why are you always in grandma's arms? Come on, get down. Mom, we'll take your leave. Please take care of the house. All right. - Let's go. Hurry up! I was dreaming of the Taj Mahal all night long. After 24 hours, you'll be standing in front of the Taj Mahal. Why have Viren and Ramu not got the taxi yet? Mummy! Viren, what happened? - Mummy! Such a big wound! - Madam, in spite of warning him.. ..he opened the taxi door and was hanging on to it. His leg has been wounded. Ramu, do one thing. Go get a doctor quickly. Run! - Okay, madam. Stop crying. Kamala, it's just a minor wound. Ramu will take care of him. Stop crying. - The taxi is waiting outside. Don't you want to catch the train? My son is wounded and you want to catch a train. - Mummy! Do one thing. You can go alone. You have office work over there. I can't leave Viru in such a condition. Kamala, after a lot of days, we've a chance to.. ..go on a business-cum-pleasure trip. Please don't cancel it. Mummy! - What is the use of spending such holidays.. ..when I'd be worrying about my son.. .and wandering in all the places? Please. Okay. Mothers and their unconditional love. This is too much. The doctor will come soon. Don't cry. Keep quiet. - Mummy! Greetings. - Ms. Kamala. Why did you open the door in such a condition? Aren't your family members at home? They have gone out. The vacations have started. They go out every year. Please, come inside. Come in. You have very high fever. Please, sit down. I'll call the doctor. No, Mr. Amrit, I'm fine. Doctor, why this blood? We have to take her x-ray right away. My suspicion was right. There is a patch of tuberculosis on Ms. Kamala's right lung. Don't be afraid. You'll be completely cured. It is God's grace.. ..that we found out about her illness at the right time. We'll start your treatment right away. Doctor. One minute. - Yes. Please come. Doctor, you know my condition. And I know Ms. Kamala's condition. I'll pay your fees. I'll pay it anyhow. But I need some time. You're giving a new life to a destitute and helpless woman. It's a very good thing. I've received my fees. Thank you, doctor. Thank you very much. Come I'll prescribe some medicine. Let's go. Ms. Kamala? Where has Ms. Kamala gone? Ms. Kamala! Ms. Kamala! Ms. Kamala! Ms. Kamala! Why did you come away from there? What is the matter? Mr. Amrit, don't try to help me. Nobody has supported this unfortunate woman. My husband left me to face all the difficulties. My son has killed me with disrespect. And now this soul wants to leave this body. It's good. I'm tired of dragging this dead body around. Let me die. Mr. Amrit, let me be. My blind fate will not recognise your kindness and sympathy. It is in our hands to change our fate. I have full confidence that you'll be completely cured. I have full confidence. Come on. "Happiness is short lived." "The fun fair also lasts for a few days." "What can I say about myself?" "Everyone is alone here." "What can I say about myself?" "Everyone is alone here." "Who is your companion?" "If compared, my sorrow is very minimal." "There is so much sorrow in this world." "If compared, my sorrow is very minimal." "After seeing peoples' sorrows."

"If compared, my sorrow is very minimal." "After seeing peoples' sorrows." "I have forgotten my sorrow." Mr. Amrit? Wonderful! This is called magic! Magic! What else? Until yesterday you were sick. And today you have prepared this juice for me. Isn't this magic? Mr. Amrit, I had lost desire to live. All this is because of your good deeds. Don't walk around too much until your new x-ray reports are out. Because the doctor has not yet confirmed that.. ..you're perfectly cured. Brother Ramcharan? I'm a bit afraid. Give me a glass of hot milk. Milk?! Boss! What is it? - Ramcharan! Ramcharan! What happened? Why haven't you delivered milk since five days? Brother Chajju, I haven't delivered any milk.. ..since the last seven days. What are you saying? What happened? The law has been troubling me. - How? I had been mixing a little water in the milk from Pandurang's tap. Now,byremoving thetap ..Pandurang has put me into trouble. Pandurang? The constable who lives down the lane. It was just a simple matter. You should've called on brother Sharafat. I didn't have to call him. He himself came up to me. And then? Then what, the case went to the court. Your Honour, the charge under which my client Mr. Ramcharan Yadav.. ..is standing in the palisade is baseless. Because it is not a crime to mix water in milk. Moreover, by using the water from constable Pandurang's tap.. ..he has not polluted the milk but has diluted it. Order. Order. Your Honour, decent people dilute alcohol with soda. And mothers dilute the milk so that infants can digest it. And when these kids grow up.. ..mix water in milk and drink cold yogurt. Why? Why is it necessary to mix water in the milk? Your Honour, it is because.. ..Indians unfortunately have never got the pure thing to eat.. ..and habitually we cannot digest anything which is pure. I challenge that if we get to drink pure milk or clarified butter.. ..we will fall sick. Our kids will be born weak. And if our children are weak.. ..then our country's existence will be in danger. Order! That's why, Mr. Ramcharan.. ..by mixing water in milk is serving the people.. ..and the country and not committing a crime. Order! Your Honour, I request you to acquit him.. ..in this case. That's all, My lord. There are loopholes in the arguments.. ..made by the defence lawyer, Mr. Sharafat Ali. The court can see clearly the crime committed by the accused. The accused has tried to feed tap-water.. ..to the next generation through milk. He has done a great crime by putting their lives in danger. And that is intolerable to the court. There is no shortage of capable doctors in our nation. The responsibility of the people's health rests with.. ..the doctors and not with the milkmen. The accused, Ramcharan, has done the crime of interfering.. ..with the job of the doctors. That's why this court, by taking into account his innocent face.. ..and also because he has been caught for the first time.. ..for his crime, declares only Rs.500 fine.. ..and bars him for six months from extracting milk from.. ..a cow, buffalo or goat and selling it. Ramcharan! Ramcharan! Ramcharan! Come to your senses. Uncle, brother Ramcharan has been wronged. Uncle! I'm doomed. Ramcharan, I know everything. Have patience. Everything will be fine. Everything will be fine. - Milk! Uncle! No! Have the milk. Drink some of it. - No! Ramcharan, keep quiet. Come on, drink the milk. Uncle! Grandma! My darling! Have you returned? Grandma, I've brought honey for you.. ..and peanut sweets for Rahul. Really? - Shall we go to the park today? Yes, my darling. - Don't just stand there. Bring the luggage. Viren, how are you? - Mom, I'm fine. Excuse me! It's so hot in Mumbai. - Well! Sister, how was the trip? Why is the fan not working? Fan! Sister, the electricity has been cut off. Electricity has been cut! Why? Didn't you pay the bill? I couldn't pay the bills because I was in trouble. Why? What happened? - After you left the old woman to fall sick. I was looking after her all day and night. All the money was spent on the medicine. Moreover, I had to take Rs.200 loan from Dhiru brothers. I knew as soon as I go out of this house.. ..she would do something like this. Rahul, I have brought peanut sweets for you. Thank you. Sunita, when did you return? Today. - Come on, sit here. Rahul, where is your grandpa? He'll come later. He had some important work to do. Mr. Amritlal, congratulations! You have won. Your selfless service has defeated Ms. Kamala's illness. She is completely cured. Thank you, doctor! Listen, Mr. Amritlal. Ms. Kamala now requires a medicine which cannot be found anywhere. And that is happiness. It is necessary to keep Ms. Kamala happy. You have cured her illness. Now, only you can give this gift of happiness. Ms. Kamala! Give me some sweets! What happened? - Your times have changed. Times? - Yes! You're completely cured! The doctor has confirmed it. Now all you have to do is always be happy. 'God has so many forms.' "Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday." "Friday, Saturday and Sunday." "In these seven days you should.." "..at least laugh 700 times." "Really, Grandpa?" "Yes! So children." "Life is a funny story." "Life is a funny story." "This is the way you should lead your life." "Life is a funny story." "This is the way you should lead your life." "Now listen." "Now listen to a funny story." "A deaf, a blind, a cripple and a beggar.." "..were travelling through a jungle." "As they were walking, the deaf said.." "Friends, wait. I can hear some thieves coming this way." "And the blind man said you can only hear them.." "..but I can even see the thieves." "The cripple said, let's run away from here." "And the beggar said.." "..hurry up or else they'll steal everything I have." "Life is a funny story." "This is the way you should lead your life." "The tom-tom sounds dum-dum." "Dance, oh, monkey, dance." "Life is a funny story." "Life is a funny story." "This is the way you should lead your life." "Now, listen." "Now, listen to a funny story." "A husband and wife would live on the eighth floor." "The husband left the house to go to the office." "As soon as he came down on the road.." "..he remembered he had forgotten his wallet." "He called out for his wife and said.." "My dear wife, thrown down my wallet." "The wife said, please say it loudly, I can't hear anything." "The husband had binoculars around his neck." "He thought of a plan." "He brought the binoculars to his eyes." "He zoomed in on his wife's face and whispered." "My dear wife, thrown down my wallet." "Life is a funny story."

"A man went to a sweet makers shop." "He threw a Re.1 coin to the shopkeeper and said.." "Friend, make me fresh and sweet yogurt." "The shopkeeper said, right away sir." "As soon as he drank the yogurt, the man got furious." "He said to the shop keeper." "You're looting the customers by serving them stale yogurt." "Give my money back." "The shop keeper said.." "Sir, it is my job to take money and not give it." "I'm just an employee here." "The man asked where the shop owner was." "The employee said, sir.." "He has gone to have yogurt from the other shop." "Life is a funny story." "Life is a funny story." "This is the way you should lead your life." Have this. You won't drink it? I'll eat it. You're very fond of sweet items. When I didn't know you.. ..I would see you eating ice-cream outside the school. Ms. Kamala, I'm helpless. Before marriage, I would hate anything sweet. After marrying Savitri, my life was filled with sweetness. She made me eat so many sweet dishes that.. ..the sweetness entered my blood. I became diabetic. Are you diabetic? - Yes. Grandpa! Grandma! Grandpa! There is a good cartoon film on TV. Let's go home and watch it together. Come on, Grandpa! Schools will reopen tomorrow. Dad and mom will not allow us to watch TV. Will they allow us today? Yes. Daddy and mummy are not at home. They've gone out and will return at night. Grandma, let's go. Come on. - Come on. Come on. Come on, Grandma. Stop it! What fuss is this? Daughter-in-law, this is Ms. Kamala. You don't even have to tell me. Her face tells me she's a maidservant. Daughter-in-law! When you're not allowed to come here.. ..then how dare you bring this lowly woman in my drawing room? I say, who are you? What is your status in this house? We have tolerated that you're unemployed.. ..and are living on your son's expenses. But now, you have stooped so low that.. ..in our absence you have secretly.. ..brought a maidservant into the house? And you're watching TV with her. Dad, I'll deal with you later. You, get out of here! If you ever come back, I'll hand you over to the police. I say, get out! Sister, what can I say? Brother Amrit's son, Madan.. ..is harassing him on being instigated by his wife. Brother Amrit has raised Madan by going through a lot of hardships. He has loved his son so much that people would compare.. ..brother Amrit's love to a mother's. Now, look at the son. He insults his father like a beggar. Sister, sometimes brother Amrit is desperate even for a penny. How did he pay for my treatment and my medicine? He earned money by putting his life and body in danger. Brother Amrit has transported 40 kilograms of stuff.. ..for 20 hours and that too on empty stomach. He has laboured until he was breathless. Why? Why did he do all this? Sister, he is like that. He can't see anybody unhappy. It seems the lord has only written sacrifice in his fate. Sister! Mr. Amrit, why are you hiding your face? A person like you should be worshipped. I'm sorry for your insult. "There's a fire in everybody's hearts." "There are tears in everybody's eyes." "Everybody you meet has a sorrowful story to tell." "Everybody you meet has a sorrowful story to tell." "The whole world is unhappy." "If compared, my sorrow is very minimal." "There is so much sorrow in this world." "If compared, my sorrow is very minimal." "After seeing peoples' sorrows." "I have forgotten my sorrow." There is a deep wound to his skull. His condition is very serious. I can't say anything until he regains consciousness. What happened? Mom, pick up the phone. Hello? Grandma? - Rahul? Grandma, grandpa has met with an accident. He is very serious. Mom, where are you going? Rahul's grandpa has met with an accident. Serve us food. Why should we care if someone is dying? You? How is Mr. Amrit's health? Please let me see him just once. You can't meet him. The doctor has warned us not to. Son, just once. Just once let me see him. You're a shameless woman! Get out of here! I had heard, your justice may be late. But now, I have found out.. ..there is no justice in your court. No justice. I have accepted every sorrow you brought to me. I have spent my whole life.. ..facing hardships and sorrow. But have I ever complained to you about it? Have I ever asked anything from you? But today, my penance, my devotion.. ..and my faith have been broken. Today, I cannot keep quiet. I cannot watch the good man who saved my life.. ..wither away so easily. I cannot tolerate the atrocities meted out to him. And neither will I. You're called a God because you give life. You receive these flowers and devotion in return. But when a person whom you have created.. ..gives life to others.. ..all he receives are stones and bad language. You have become immortal by drinking poison. He too has drunk poison. And he is getting death? Why? Listen, if you can. If anything happens to him.. ..then you'll just be a lifeless idol for me. And nothing more. Oh, Lord, I have become a Muslim from being an atheist. My Lord, please spare my friend's life. My Lord, please spare my friend's life. Mr. Amrit? Mr. Amrit? Grandpa? Grandpa? Mummy! Daddy! Rahul, what happened? Grandpa is not his room. Not in his room? Where did he go? Thank God, he's out of danger. He'll get better soon. Give these tablets, three times a day. Mr. Amrit, I'll take your leave. Okay. - Thank you, doctor. Sharafat Ali, that's enough. My friend, why are you bringing me to shame? Brother Amrit, I'm trying to earn some good merit. I did not get it in the courts.. ..but maybe I'll get some happiness in the court of life. Uncle, have this. Hot milk with turmeric! Here. Drink it quickly. Who says I'm alone in this world? Mom! Where were you all night? Daughter-in-law, Mr. Amrit had met with an accident. But by the grace of God, he is out of danger. I'll bring a cup of tea for you. Give us poison instead of tea. If the old man was sick then.. ..was there only you to look after him? Where was his family? By making an excuse of his illness.. ..you had gone to disgrace the respect of our family. Decent people live in this house. Do you think this is a brothel? Daughter-in-law? Don't address me as your daughter-in-law? I'd rather die than be called the daughter-in-law.. ..of a disrespectful woman like you. We know about all the fun you had in our absence. You've spoilt the respect of this family while fulfilling your desire. Hold your dirty and false tongue! You've addressed a widow as a woman of the streets. I'll kill you! Let her go! You shameless! I've given birth to you and raised you. I'm your mother. My purity is being questioned in front of you. My character is being assassinated and you're doing nothing! Why don't you kill yourself? - Go away from here! I'll not let your bad character influence this house. Get out of here! I say get out of here! No! Get out! - What are you doing? Don't throw me out of here. This is my husband's house. A wife goes out of her husband's house on a pyre. Don't commit this sin. I beg of you. Don't throw me out! Grandma! - Please.. Daddy, don't throw grandma out of this house. She's no more your grandma! Come. - Grandma! Get out of here! I'll not listen to your pleas! It's too much! Get away from here! Drink this. Sister, what happened? Sister, what happened? Brother, I have become homeless. My son questioned my sanctity and threw me out of my house. Until your brother is still alive, you cannot be homeless. You cannot be homeless. Grandpa! - Grandma! Rahul! - My darling! Grandpa, why did you go away from me? I can't live without you. No, I can't. Rahul? Come home! I'll not go home! I'll live here with my grandpa. So that you too may become a loafer and rowdy like him! Daughter-in-law? - She's right. Dad, you should be ashamed. At this age, you're living here with your concubine. Well done, my son! Well done! You have given me very big reward. You have branded your father as a loafer and a rowdy. You have spoilt my name. You have questioned a mother's love. If I had wanted I would have kept a woman.. ..right after your mother's death and then.. ..you'd have begged sitting outside an orphanage. - Dad! You have stooped too low. You're giving a bad name to the two unhappy people who.. ..want to share their unhappiness. Even we don't know what our relationship is. We are two lonely people.. ..waiting for our death. You have disgraced us. How are we going to face the society? You have spoilt the future of these kids. People will point their fingers at us. We'll have to leave this city. - No, my son. Until now I have not disgraced you. I won't do it in the future. We will leave this city. We will not live in this dirty society. Ms. Kamala, let's go. - Brother, don't go. Haseena, you have always yearned for a child, haven't you? If children are like these then I bless you.. Lord shouldn't give you any children. Grandma, I'll not let you go. Sunita, let them go. Grandpa, go on. Don't return to this bad place again. We will live without you. We'll live without you. Sunita, tomorrow we'll be in Pune with them. We are very lucky. We'll begin our married life with.. ..the blessings of our grandpa and grandma. But I wonder what condition they will be in? Congratulations on your wedding, my son. On this happy occasion.. ..don't seize the rights of your parents to bless you. The ones who could not take the blessings of their parents.. ..have no right to bless their children! Don't punish us further. Forgive us. Your crimes are so gruesome even God will not forgive you. We have seen our grandparents die.. ..little by little with your taunts. You have murdered the self-respect and the souls of your parents. My daughter, have pity on your crippled father. You had thrown grandma out of your house.. ..with these hands, hadn't you? Have you forgotten? Enough! My daughter, enough! Dad, you reap as you sow. You have treated your parents worse than animals. Now, you'll also yearn for your children. Your crippled old age will be very severe on you. People will learn from your incomplete and despicable life. And they'll never disrespect their elders. We're going to meet our grandparents.. ..to apologise for your sins. We have no relation with you. Sunita, let's go. "Life is a funny story." "Life is a funny story." "This is the way you should lead your life." "Life is a funny story." "Life is a funny story." "This is the way you should lead your life." Now, add salt and turmeric in it. Aarti! You should not add spicing at a high flame. There could be a fire. Sorry, ma'am. Very good. I'll take your spoon, okay. Thank you. Ms. Kamala, let's have a cup of hot tea. Wash yourself. I'll bring it right away. You'll never change. All these years you have always given me insipid tea. We are slaves of our habits. Uncle Amrit, someone has come to meet you. You haven't recognised me! I'm your grandson, Rahul! Rahul?! - Yes. My friend! My darling! Why are you here? Grandpa, I've got married. Really?! - Yes. Have a long life. Haven't you recognised me, Grandma? I'm Sunita, your granddaughter! My darling! Darling! - Grandma! You've grown up and how. You've also got married! My child, take this. - Grandpa, what's this? Let it be. This is not a gift. This is the interest. I'm under your debt. I have eaten a lot of your ice-creams. Chocolate! You haven't forgotten your grandpa's weakness, have you? Ms. Kamala, these kids have given a name to our relationship. Congratulations, madam!
