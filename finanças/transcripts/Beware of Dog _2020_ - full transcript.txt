That's the first beating I remember and you know stuff went on like that for awhile. I don't remember much else from those years. That was my first big of heartbreak in life, I was really confused and hurt. After like two or three fights like that, I had stashed a knife, a kitchen knife in my room somewhere, I stashed it really good. And I was like, thinking in my head, I have thoughts of actually killing him in his sleep because I was so tired of getting beat up on. I just lost it one day, he came in my room, he comes in with his fists clenched, face turning red, vein popping out in his head and I know from that, that he's about to beat me up. But I said, this time I'm gonna fight back. I said, I don't care if I win or lose, just check it out. If I win, then that's great, I would love to beat the shit out of you. I said, but you know you're bigger, you're stronger than me. If you win, which you probably will, I don't care. I'll take an ass beating, but I guarantee old man when it's all said and done, I don't know where, I don't know when, but I will fucking kill you, 'cause I'm sick of the shit, I'll kill you. I told him that and he backed away he never touched me again. And I was dead serious, I wasn't fucking around. And that's that?

So you know, it's like, it's quite a... It's like, I don't really know what exactly it's going to be about but... The other day, I was reading about a work of Shepard Howard and I was thinking of- - Like, you're gonna do this thing of this houseboat, it's like a shared community. Like my idea was kind of like this but bigger and has a high sense of architecture. I think it's super, it's like, it's not a houseboat but it's like a shared community where generations can like (SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) English, its like you're speaking all the fucking time and you don't let me speak. Now what's wrong with you? - No, nothing. - What did you take? - Paula what did you take? - I'm just excited. I didn't take any drugs, I'm just excited, okay? Like I want to make this project and if you want to join, it would be amazing, we can think it together, better. And I know that there's this kind of this houseboat... Stop touching me.

She doesn't talk to me on the phone, I haven't seen her in almost a month. We text each other a little bit, that's about it. Yeah, you're gonna text. I haven't even texted her in a few days. I don't know I'm done, I'm done trying, if she doesn't wanna be with me, she doesn't wanna be with me, that's it. I wish she would just have the guts to come out and say so instead of beating around the bush. Look man, I don't wanna sound like I know everything but I told you she's not right for you. You gotta find somebody sober. It is what it is. What am I gonna do? I can't force someone to be in love with me, if she doesn't love me no more, she doesn't want me no more. I'm not gonna fucking cry about it either. You sure about that? I don't know. I'm like stuck in limbo, I don't know what the fuck's going on. I mean, I have to guess that though, I mean, I'm pretty cynical, so I always guess the worst, but pretty much have to assume that she doesn't love me anymore. Why would someone not want to see me for a month? If I love someone, I want to see them. I understand like she needs space, if she needs space, she needs space. But Jesus Christ like a whole month goes by and she doesn't even wanna see me once? Not even for a few hours? That sucks, man. It really does. Maybe you should concentrate on the people that give a shit about you instead of the ones who would rather see you die. I'm like, look at you man, you look like shit. You just sit here and talk about yourself. Can you blame her not wanting to be with you? I mean, you don't think she was right a little bit. She is. But at the same time though, I wouldn't leave her if she was doing that. I don't know, maybe, I don't know man, her standards are high. I can tell you right now that, whatever you wanna do with this girl it's not gonna go nowhere. I'ma leave you to make that decision on your own. I guess my standards aren't as high. If I love someone, I love them through thick and thin, whether they're drinking, whatever. That's that unconditional fixation. You like something, so you perceive whatever you like on to somebody else and then you mistake it for unconditional love but it's not, man. You gotta love yourself first, I can tell that you don't. MIKE: I know. Look at you, you had so much potential when we was growing up, now you're just rotting away. You need to get back into boxing. You act like you're the only one that's ever felt bad, I mean, I went through my struggles with my writing, but I'm back on my feet. And to watch you just destroy yourself sucks dude, I can't sit here and watch you kill yourself, I can't. I'll talk to you later. (CAR ENGINES ROARING) (CAR HOOTING) (SUBWAY CARS CLUNKING) Twice, I got fucking jumped with baseball bats and I'm the one who gets arrested and my attackers don't get arrested, how the fuck is that? Now, let me tell you about the NYPD, right? So they're supposed to protect and serve us, they don't fucking do that. In the park, motherfuckers, there's the girl who said I stole her tablet. And then the cops get there, I get arrested. And I'm telling the cops all the time, I don't have a tablet on me, what are you arresting me for? No, she said you stole her tablet last night. Last night? Then why didn't she call you guys last night? What are you worrying about me for anyway when this fucking kid stabbed my friend. There's someone laying right across the street, is what it feels like right now. I'm like, but why don't you go look at my friend? Oh, we'll look into it, they never looked into it. And then, like a few months ago I get jumped again by people with bats and I get arrested again because the window got broken. Like come on y'all, twice. And the motherfucker was hitting me with baseball bat. In this city, you can jump someone with baseball bats and if you call the cops first and say, oh, they fucked with me first. They aren't gonna get arrested. And see, that's the NYPD for you, man.

In New York City right now, this girl is the only thing that makes me happy. Just spending time with her and she's never coming back. - You taste like alcohol. - You finally smelled me, I knew you would do that You taste like fucking alcohol, so you're lying. I'm losing weight, you know why? Not because I'm on drugs because I actually just don't have enough food to eat in the house. Oh my God, why do I have to? What are you so mad at me for? Because it's like I only have to deal with your needs. Are you fucking serious? When we're at my house, do you know how many things you asked me for? I asked you for one thing, what else have I asked you for. Oh, shut up. And then besides this, I'm stuck in this lifestyle now just doing things I don't wanna be doing. (HAND SLAPPING) Aww, what the fuck? You fucked up my makeup asshole. (SUBWAY CARS CLUNKING) I know deep down I have a good heart but you know I do fucked up things. And you told me 90 days well 90 days are like what, three months? Then you'll know like I've really changed for almost three months. But you've drank, of course. I've drank a few times. I feel like you can't go 90 days without drinking if you tried. MIKE: I could. So then why don't you just do it? MIKE: Because I can and I will. I'm not drinking today, I didn't drink yesterday. You said it's all about today, right? I don't know. If you don't have faith in me, you don't have faith in me. I do have faith in you Mike. Well, then you know you're still bringing it up and I feel like once you go to this rehab that you're going to think about that even more. And then you're gonna start thinking, oh, I'm gone for a month, he's probably drinking all the time now. I am going to hell, you don't even get to suffer with any company, there's no solidarity in hell. You don't even get to see the devil, probably.
