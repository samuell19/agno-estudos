Daddy, why do not you? call mom I'll call her dear Cristina? We will need a photo of the child. Yes of course. She must have followed someone, or a dog, or a child's toy. She has not gone nowhere. I asked the other parents. who were there. I called, searched the ditches, in the bushes. I went to the lake to know if she had fallen. I knew it was not, but I checked, anyway. Our team of divers is looking at the lake now. She is not there! Was the first place where I looked. "She could not have gone there in front of me. "But it crossed your mind." We have to consider everything, not I'm telling you what happened. But these are the procedures. I remember one thing. The little girl who led To Maria to the bathroom said that Mary mentioned whistles, or a whistle. The face of the bal is sells that kind of crap. I looked for him, but he was gone. She may have gone ... Maybe it's nothing, alane, as they say. Maybe she wanted a whistle and had followed him? She does not follow anyone. She is not going anywhere without my permission. I understand. Do you have conflicts with anyone? At work, at home? - No. - Are your children in another relationship? - It's ours. Is your wife having an affair? Lover revenge? Do not. - Is that you? - No. Your wife does not need know by the hour. Do not. - Are there any cases that have not been resolved? - It happens. Tell me, you suspect someone? Can you think of someone in particular? Any conflict, even if small? Someone who wanted damage you A bad joke or something like that? No, it's impossible. At least no one I know. "A family member?" - No. But some guy's been calling for my wife recently. Well, I realized there will be a few days. She said he was a customer, She is an accountant and I believe in her. But I called him this. I insulted him. If you believed her, Why did you call him? I do not know. Instinct, I think. - When did you call him? - This morning, from the bathroom. From your phone? No, from Cristina, to have sure that he would attend. I did not tell Cristina. We'll have to tell her, this could be a clue. But cases like this are rare. And the events are very close. - The connection and the disappearance? - Yes. Do you know who he is? My wife's client. She's an accountant. But I do not know him. She has many clients. Tell me how it happened. I do not know. I can tell you what I think it happened. "That's not what I meant. "What did you mean?" You were in the park. What What were you doing when you noticed? Tell me. What time did you get to the park? Just after 11am. I told you. We do not live in ten minutes. of the park. We left home at 11am. - Have you had breakfast? - Yes.

And put with cheese. - What time? - About 9:30. Did you notice anyone? following you? Do not. I live in a quiet neighborhood I do not stare at you when I leave. You see the world you live in. Watch. I need to do these questions. An apparent detail can be crucial. Trust me. The faster you to retrace your steps, the better. Details disappear over time, our memory will erase them. Inevitably we forget. What is your address? Rua Crinul de Munte, 5, building G5, staircase A, 8, floor, apt. 41. Show me your identity please - Mine? - Yes, yours. Are not you wearing a wedding ring?

Do not have cameras in the park? I'm afraid not. I checked. There are cameras everywhere, except in the parks. - What's the logic? "Yes, but not all parks. And not in that? Any particular brand? Speech problem? She is five and a half years old. - What can I say? "Does she have tongue?" No, she's pretty smart. Any scar? Bruised She has a bruise on the left knee. He fell off the bike. "What was she wearing?" - A pair of jeans. A flowery blouse and sandals. - What color? - I did not notice. Yellow suede mustard with bright pebbles yellow. A T-shirt white with blue flowers, green and pink. A pink bracelet with pink turquoise stones and transparent and a heart. She was braided and ... a pink hair clip in the form of honey. Your husband talked about someone. who keeps calling you. It is irrelevant. He's just a customer. - What I meant is ... - I understood, but not. There are no connections. As far as I know, he's in the outside this weekend. And even if they were not ... There is no connection. But I can give you his number. But it has nothing to do with it. It is pure coincidence. My husband is ... with as much fear as I am. - What's his name? - Nimerea Cipriam. Here is his number. Just a second. Were you playing football? Did you see your sister joking? You'd have to tell us. If you saw, tell us, dear. We did not discuss this. If he had, he would have. He is very protective of Maria. He takes care of her, he would have told us immediately. Did you see anyone selling whistles? Saw Maria comment about whistles? - A little girl ... - Ada. Ada. Do you know her? All right, Ada said ... who heard Maria say that wanted a whistle. Do not be afraid, dear, the Sir, you're asking. It's not your fault, my love. He's only asking, so we can understand what happened. It's all right, dear. He does not know, he would have said. Come on, finish it. - What about the escalope? - I do not want it. How are you, my dear? - Do not you like it? - What can I say? - Was the traffic slow? - Neither do I. - Give me the slippers. - Stop, Dad, do not be silly. - Give it to me. Where are your slippers? Do you want it too? - Hello. - Hello. How is my treasure? My little treasure? All right? Eat a little while I put Ilie in bed. How did this happen? Were not you looking at it? M م e! Do you want Ilie to stay with us? for a few days? Do not. Because? I thought I could help. He has a school, it's impossible. Right. The better. Hello. One child disappeared in the Saturday, did you see her? Alone or with someone? No, I do not recognize it. - Excuse me. - Thank you. Hello. A child disappeared in the park in the Saturday. You, by some chance, Did you see that little girl? Alone, or giving someone a hand? I do not know. - I do not want to be a burden. "You are not." If you need help, I can come. Maybe buy some treats. - There's food for a few days. - Right. - Hello. - Hello, Tudor. Have you come back yet? - I'm hungry. - Yes Dear. Change clothes and wash hands. - Let's eat then. "But I'm hungry." Wash the hands, then Let's set the table. Come on. Let's wash our hands. Do not leave your backpack here. Ilie, did you hear me? I'm talking with you. Ilie? Come and change your clothes. Did they call? Do not. What's for dinner? Gabi made chicken and soup. You did not go to work? I could not I took a few days off. Why did not you cancel it with her? It helps in the tasks. I know I decided this morning. - You want her to leave? - No. Whatever. I talked to a friend, a journalist. Who is it? Cristi Nitescu. We play pole together. Our daughters are in the same room. He suggested that we put a photo in the newspaper. In the United States, they put photos in boxes of milk. Seriously, Lulu ... How serious, Lulu? What? "When did you see him?" - Today. I told you. That's a good idea. I'm talking about the milk cartons. Evil will not do it. It's because she's in a box of milk, does not mean you are looking. That's not the idea. Do you remember her. I understand, but I do not think so. that would work. If you see a child from five years alone and disoriented, you take her to the police. You do not need it see it in a box of milk. That's if she's alone. And if she's with someone and you do not know what it looks like? You do not know, do you? If she's alone and crying This is silly. The mechanisms of self-control of children are not developed at this age. When you are with fear, they say: "I want my hand! I wanna go home!" If you threaten them, they do not cry. Stop, Lulu! I think it's a good idea. I'm not sure about the newspaper. I hate Facebook, It's a waste of time, but ... in this case, it could be useful. We need to make a post immediately. We can post a link, people share, information spreads. Everyone is on the internet nowadays. The form is dead. "Where is your sister?" - With Ilie. "Are you okay?" - Yes. - Do you want a beer? - They're looking at the drawing. - Do you want one? - No. I'll ask you tomorrow to the police what he thinks. About what? Over the newspaper, the milk cartons. - I want to print her picture. "Ah, the police ... how can I say?" They find their son if he You're at your bleeding, lifeless door. - Jesus Christ! - Shut the fuck up! What is your problem? Why say that? "Do you know what I mean?" "You know how to be an idiot." I'm just trying to help. What do you want us to do? Let's just sit here? That was really stupid! - Give me a sip. "If it were your daughter, would you be eating peel of the tree in the park, you idiot! Fucking idiot! "That's not what I meant." "Please, shut up!" - You should... - Enough! Holy shit ... There is a national alert. Her photo was distributed all over the country. It can not have crossed the border. We'll find it for sure. I know this is difficult, you have to be patient. We are doing our best, under the circumstances. What circumstances? Since we do not have no real clue. "What about the lake?" - It was dredged, our divers are not they found nothing. I would have told you. And as for the guy who called for my wife? We continue to question, but it seems that there is no connection. He is abroad, as she said. And the park's parents? "Did you ask them for photos?" - Yes. - Anything? "Nothing significant at the moment. Five of us are investigating the disappearance of his daughter. Why five? Considering the number of cases and the population, that is enough. We also have field agents. We're doing everything we can. Hello. Hello. I saw the pictures. No news? Do not. They're still looking for you. Can I ask you a favor? On Sunday you took photos. with your phone? "Or did I? "No, that's true. That did not occur to me. One second. On here. Swipe right. Thank you. What time do they were taken? How can I know? I think about 11am. Do you mind sending them? to my phone? - No way. - I can not see well. The sun is strong. I want to put them in chronological order I'll create a folder with all the photos of the parents. It's all right. I do not know how to do, but if you know ... Yes, by bluetooth. Cris! Come here one second, my dear! She's going to see Simona at the kiosk. and ask her to come here. - At where? - At the kiosk. The girl in the green blouse and yellow hat. Ask her to come here please. She's always pulling. - Photos? - Yes. "Maybe hers are more useful." - Thank you. "What do you want to dream about?" - That I'm an astronaut flying on the back of a drag. Where the drag is flying In space, between the stars and spaceships. - Mother? - Yes Dear. Where is Maria? I took the photos. of the parks. Taken on Sunday. Maybe there's a clue. Do you want to go for a ride? I do not want to go nowhere. I can hardly move. We're not going to leave and leave. the Ilie sleeping. Maybe we should send him to My parents on the coast for a few weeks. It is not an idea as such. So? I'm thinking. I do not know what to say. I'm going to bed maybe I can Sleep a little. - There you go. - I do not have a fork. - Juice or milk? - Juice. Do not forget to take the yogurt. I do not have a spoon. - For what? - For the yogurt. P م o. I do not like tomatoes. I will not do another one. Put it on the side. Hello. I'm not going today. Yes. Yes. OK Bye. I do not know. Right. Hello. Do you sell whistle? No, s bal is. "So what is it?" - It's to make noise. For children to know that I'm here. - I've seen you by now. - I come here a lot. My daughter disappeared. there are three days. I'm sorry. A child who was with her He heard her say she wanted a whistle. I thought maybe you could have seen it. The police interrogated me. I assumed it was about that. I come a lot, but I do not remember her. I told the same thing to the cops. It is impossible to remember. Seeing bal is for many children ... and for parents too. And in other parks too. I can not remember. It is impossible. Imagine. She's a blonde girl. Maybe you've seen her leaving. with someone? Even if I had seen her, how would I know? Excuse me. I wish I could help, but I did not notice anything. I'm not being stupid, but really ... Hello. Mr. Pricop? This is Tudor Ionescu. Do not. I mean, yes. Any news? The little girl who disappeared on Sunday. We did not go to the movies. Did you go to the movies? Yes. Come here. See, Daddy. Come here. Look! You ate? No, I was waiting for you. Did you see? Are you hungry? Eat some cookies. I've told you a million times. Dishes with plates, and cups with cups! - Go to your room, please. - It's fine. I'll stay a little with mom. I called that asshole. and told him not to call. Excuse me. Excuse me. Was... pathetic. It was not pathetic. I understand. Fuck him. I do not give a damn. He is not involved in it. I would have told you right away. She wanted to be a dancer. and puppeteer. I mean, make clothes for puppets And astronomer and princess. Ilie wanted to be a sweeper, remember? Why that? Do not know where did that come from. He reduced the list to the carateca, pilot and soccer player. We will have an interesting life. You've been mean to her. "You hit her." - When? Last week, when she I was playing with a doll. You were in a bad mood. I said in ballet that she did not I went more and paid. What do you mean, you paid? Because? What do you mean, why? We did not have what to pay. I paid. It's not their fault. Should not we have paid? Do you think they would feel bad and they would not charge the money? They wanted the money. of them, then I paid. Why would we pay if she is not going anymore She goes. What's the matter with you? We do not have to pay, we owe money to them. "That's not what I meant. "So what?" We are arguing for Ballet money? What the fuck! I want to go to my parents house. I can not handle it any more, Tudor. I do not know what to do. Forgive me, my dear. Forgive me. What happened, dear? - I'm playing with Hector. - Hector? Is that his name? Anto also has a dog named Hector. Well. Hector's a pretty name. - It's just that he's white. - He is white? Are we staying with Grandpa? - When? - Tomorrow or later. Soon. Is Dad going too? Daddy has to work, he can not go now. Can we take the dog? Yes Dear. "Are you still mad at me?" - No. A kiss? Let's put on your pajamas. Stay here. Put your arms up. Yes? Hi. No, I will not. I need more time. One week ... I do not know. How is life? Seriously? No kidding? I'm sure. You ate? Yes, a little left. Yes, it is normal. In your parents? How nice. You need anything? Do not know, clothes, maybe? Say something. Anything. Do not cry, please. Please. Please honey. I do not ... why say that? I did not hit her! Because keep saying that You said on the phone. who had a suspicion. Have you seen him in the park before? It is unusual to suspect someone? No, it happens. Have coffee. I'm trying to follow his reasoning. There is one thing bizarre in relation to him. Very bizarre. It's a guess, I'm not. asking to arrest him ... just to talk to him. He can say something. You are the expert. "You can get some detail. - Let me understand ... He is suspect because he was alone in the park at that time? Why was he alone? Why was he in the park? Or did he do something what made you believe that he is connected to the disappearance of his daughter? Did he act strange? What prompted this suspicion? Sorry, but the fact that he be in some photos and in the park, it's not enough We need evidence to support your intuition. We can not question him s because he was in the park. Many people go to the parks nowadays. What brings you to this conclusion? I feel. It's not a whim. I know a lot of people will see to the park, I'm not stupid. Something tells me this guy is linked to her disappearance. It's not like there's a tone of suspicion and I accused some old woman. Why are not you at the park? playing with the kids now? Not with your children, but with those of other people. - Did he play with them? - Yes. As the child's father, I say that I have a hunch. Is not that enough? Does he have to be caught up with her? I did not say that. Maybe it's Sorry for not having children ... - Sad? - Yes. You can not prevent people to go to the park. Do other parents know you? There are many possibilities. Did you talk to other parents? Does anyone know him? No, no one knows him. One woman said she could have seen it. What should I do? Do you get it in the act? See, I did not say that. Please try to understand. "Just listen to me. - I'm listening. Sometimes the parents have suspicions, and presume things about people. In most cases, believe me, these accusations are unfounded. We are just idiots blinded by suffering, right? I did not say that. Calm down. - I'm calm. "Let's try to talk." I want to hear your arguments, but try to understand. - I can not go randomly ... - That's not random. - Let me finish. - It's not random. Please. Please wait. Do not interrupt. I can not say to someone: Let's talk because they think You have a relationship with a missing girl. - Because? - Because? Because he saw you in the park. Apparently, you were there. in the day, although the photos are blurred. This is a recent one, I say, were taken on the day. Blurred? I recognize him. He and many others! Let's be logical. It may be pure coincidence. If I found him on the street, I would not recognize him. You are emotionally involved. This is different ... Do you think I'm blind? Look at him! You are suffering. Usually who suffers, suspects everyone ... family, friends, neighbors, known. This is a fact. We have to filter everything. Can not you just talk to him? That's what I'm asking. It is possible. We can do this. Let's not talk. See, I took into account the your considerations as the child's father. But I can not make accusations. There is no solid ground for this. I understand this, do not talk to me like I'm crazy. Just talk to him. Right. Leave the photo, let's go call him to a conversation. But he has no obligation to come. Tell me... How often does this type of suspicion is solved? - I do not have precise numbers. - About. It has already happened. In percentage, how many children are found? Believe me, each case is different. I'm asking for a percentage, not a comparison. It is difficult to say. Hello. It's Mr. Ionescu. I was there earlier. May I speak to Inspector Pricop? I thought he came back. He does not answer the phone. Got it. The person you called is not available ... Furious, the queen ordered that to kill her in the forest. Hey, little man. Did she make donuts? It's so yummy! I do not think so. A donut He will not do evil to him. You can give him one. All right, little man. I love you. Goodbye. Hi. I do not know what to say. I ate something. A little fish. I thought I'd see you. Why not? Do you think it's easy for me? What the fuck, Cristina ... You've lost my daughter! Do you realize? You left her with two children ... Where is Maria? - Where is Maria? - Perd. - What else can I say? - Nothing. Do not say anything. Until you bring my daughter Back, do not say anything. A photo of him in the park. It's not a test. There were a lot of people in the park. Rationally, it can not be suspect. They are not all suspects ... until, with a ل libi, be discarded? - No. - Or whatever ... No, we always operate presuming innocence. Same for the suspects. They're called suspects. because they are in a list. "But that does not make them guilty. - I did not say that. - I understood wrong. - Yes. - Are not guilty until they are discarded? - No, they're all innocent. We have to prove that they are guilty of some crime. If he were home alone, I would have to find the connection between the time and place of the crime. Does not that sound normal? It is not normal to ask the Why was he there? Not really. You too was there, with many others. - We had no reason. Maybe he had a reason. Maybe I like going to the park. Parks are not for children. Do not talk to me like if I were mentally weak. But to answer your question, I questioned him like everyone else. - So he's a suspect? - Clear. Like all others who we identify Yeah, we just checked. But I would not say he's suspect, we're just talking Whatever. Does he have a libya? It is not a ل libii until we know with what we are dealing with. But what he said made sense. What you mean? He was in the park. and then he went home. I was with the neighbor's son. who have no father. He did not behave suspiciously. He cooperated well. What can I say? There was nothing suspicious. Where is the proof that he I was at home? Is this a libya? He went to the park. - That will not lead to anything. I told you he never denied it. What evidence are you talking about? Mr Ionescu, the procedure does not it works like this. I mean... There is some proven evidence. He is in the camera of a shop, in a supermarket. - What market? - One near the park. "That confirms his statement." - What time? 2:00 p.m. Maria disappeared at 12:30 p.m. I know, but it is unlikely that he has hijacked and gone shopping. Statistically speaking. It is not impossible, but highly improbable. I think it is quite probable. Especially if he lives near the park. Between what we found and the facts, there is evidence. And now seriously, like you. Do you know where he lives? I asked. It's strange to take the son. from another person to the park. Is he babys? What he does? You're retired for medical reasons. He was at customs. Then why the child is not with him in any of the photos? How can you tell? Maybe you have not recognized him. "Your daughter is not in any photo, either." - It is. I told you that she it was in the photos This is not proof. Not everyone in the park is in the pictures. This is normal. That happens. What are we accusing them of? Are not they photogenic? To hide? Let's go! What did this neighbor say? You asked? Please calm down. - I'm calm. You asked? - Yes, we did not ask. "Did she confirm?" - Yes. You can not test it with a Lies detector? Mr. Ionescu, we can ask him, but he has no obligation to accept. Even if he accepts, by law, he is not obligated. The polish is not evidence in court. So he can lie and not be accused. Do not lie. Even if tests are inconclusive, yes. Stress can lead to that people fail the test ... It's not necessarily a lie. It is for the experts to say. And I'm not obligated. to disclose information. I'm doing this because I know What are you going through? Do not think that we do not know do our job. I have lives. My daughter disappeared. there are 47 days. Yes? Hello. They told me to come. Mr. Ionescu. - First name? - Tudor. Hello. She was on her way here. when I called. The description hits, but she is in shock. They are not the same clothes, but who knows? We are not in the sub category, on a road near the Police Academy. A friend called me right away. and sent her away. Did she say the name? Something like that? No, nothing. She is not talking. She is dirty and scared, we know nothing about it. No other child looks like it was reported, so we are not sure. This way. Wait. Just a minute. I'm so sorry. I did not know without you. Do not give up. I know how hard it is. Did you talk to that guy? Yes, Mr. Ionescu. He's scared. Do you know who you are, said you're following him. - Through the streets, through the parks. - Lie. I want him to go through Lies detector. Let's discuss this with him, are you okay? - I really do ... - Please... Stop saying you understand. You do not understand. Please let us do our work. I know it's hard. Believe me. I also have children. I totally understand. But we can not accuse people without evidence. He was about to give complaint against you. Please, forget this idea. Stop investigating like that. Let us take care of that. It's our job. IDIOT Who is it? He broke a pipe in Boldeanu's house. We need to turn off the water. Maria... Maria! Where are you, my daughter? Maria! Where are you, sweetheart? Where are you my Love? Where are you? Skirt. Maria... Sweetheart, where are you? Where are you? Where are you? Maria! Where are you playing? Mr.?
