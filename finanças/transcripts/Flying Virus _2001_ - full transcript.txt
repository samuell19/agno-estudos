Tensions are high as a result of the US not signing the Kyoto agreement, the global treaty aimed at reducing the world's pollution and emittance levels. The State Department is declaring the Brazilian rainforest to be of national interest to the US since May 1998. Unidentified tribesmen of Brazil's Amazon River region, protesting what they call death pollution, have taken over and shut down two dozen American oil installations. To date, these sieges have cost the petroleum industry almost $14 billion. In response, the US and Brazilian governments broke ground on a new program they hope will end this turmoil and bring these two sides together. Scott Turner from the US State Department is here to oversee the program. It's a win-win, Ann. Under SBP, the area businesses will receive this paved superhighway and a unilateral peace keeping force to prevent further hostilities. Now, the tribesmen will receive our word that this highway will extend no further than 100 miles into the country, a moratorium on any new drilling, and restrictions on pollution and emissions that will be stricter than ever before. Hopes hang high here that separate, but protected, may finally bring an end to this unrest. From the town of Brazil, I'm Ann Bauer, ICN News. And clear. Good. Man it's hot. Quadrant 10 all clear. Follow up check at 1300 hours. Hopes hang high here. That's a large lump of alliteration, wouldn't you say? Bite me, Raka. I am tired. Tired, I wouldn't guess. Horny for a certain State Department suit, maybe, but not tired. What? Yes, Mr. Turner, please tell us what you are doing to save the indigenous peoples. He's not that bad. Well, the perfect hair does hide the pointy little horns. Boy toy at six o'clock. Scotty. Hello again. Hi. Listen, I was... I was wondering if you had any plans for dinner. You mean, something other than black beans and rice for the fifth consecutive day? Exactly. How would you like to come to Brasilia with me for a real dinner? Steak, french fries... You serious? I never joke about dinner. That sounds like a plan. Great, excellent. Just give me 15 minutes, OK? All right. OK. My god. Scotty, look. Hit it. Attack! Attack, attack! Fire. Get your guns. Come on, guys. Get some coverage. Get down! Get down! Where is it coming from? Get your gun. Come on, guys. Get behind here, now. There they are. Shit. Jesus Christ. What? What? I don't like this, Ann. We were told not to leave camp. We're breaking curfew. They took my tapes. They took my camera. Do you mind telling me what we are looking for? No idea. Well, how are we going to know when we find it? No clue. This has been fun. I'm going back now. - No. Raka, no. Wait. They are hiding something. I can feel it. Ann, what are they hiding? I don't know yet. We haven't found it. Tell me exactly what the tribesman said. He said he was a shadow people. Shadow people? The hell is shadow people? Supposedly, the ultimate warriors of the Amazon. And until today, I just thought, just a legend, but. Well, why would they be here? Well, that's what freaked me out. When I asked him that, he said.. My Portuguese is a little rusty. What? Ann, that's demons from the sky. Demons from the sky? Shadow people? I wonder if they're looking for an anchor in Wichita Falls. Run. What the... This is a restricted area. Do not move. Passaporte. Ann Bauer. I'm a journalist. Come on, guy. I'm just doing my job. No. Shit. Vamos. Let's go. Get out of here. Blood pressure stable, no infection, rapid tissue regeneration due to unknown toxin. Unknown toxin? What the... Looks like some kind of insect. My god. Get well soon, sexy. Got to go. Doctor? Well, yes and no. Let me be specific. Are you my wife's doctor? Wife? Martin Bauer. I'm Ann's husband. North. Dr. Stephen North. How did you... Ann's emergency contact card. Are you my wife's doctor? No. Actually we're more like associates. Associates? Yes, associates. Well, Mr. Associate, you want to tell me why you're playing tonsil hockey with my comatose wife? I think you've got the wrong idea. Yeah? Well, maybe. But I think you better get your ass out of here before I introduce my foot to your ass. Lovely. Excuse me. I can't imagine why she'd be divorcing someone as charming as you. These babies really are the perfect killers. Our bioengineered beauties cleared six towns. No wonder they call them demons from the sky. Sir, census shows 37 villagers. We have 37 confirmed kills. 37 out of 37, that's not bad. We're moving to the next town. Yes, sir. I'm trying to make up my mind if I should let you live. You should've killed that reporter last night. Yes, sir. I'm very disappointed. Can I trust you? Yes, sir. You don't like me? No, sir, I don't. Good, let's keep it that way. I'm going to give you one more chance. Sir? What are you... Better be quick. Goodbye. Shit. Merda. Show me exactly where you were on the base. Why are you so interested? Raka, this could save Ann's life. You want to help or not? All right. All right. Somewhere around here. Dr. North, what is it today? An outbreak of trench foot or jock itch? Just some research, thank you. Come on, guys. Come on, let's get moving. OK, clear this out. Yeah, right here. Right in here. That's good. Go back. Contusions of the face and chest, insect toxins appear to have sped up tissue regrowth. Rule out ants. OK, where are you guys? Come on. I know you're here somewhere. What the... My god. What are you doing here? Let's see. In case of emergency, call Martin Bauer, husband. That's me. So you want to tell me what happened? I'm pretty sure that I got shot. After that, I don't know. Those welts are nasty looking. That's attractive. It didn't seem to bother your boyfriend. Boyfriend? Dr. North. Gross. He's a medical researcher. Well, he had you in a lip lock when I came in the room. It just makes me wonder what kind of research he's doing. What the hell are you saying? Look, why don't you just come back to New York with me? Here it comes. Ann, I need you. Yeah, Martin's needs first, right? Come on. Don't start with that again. Yes, this again. Do you even remember why I left? See if this rings a bell. Let's have a baby, Martin, start a family. Look, I want those things too, but I just... When? Some day, I don't know. You know, these last few months, I have realized that you will never be ready to be a dad. Because you will never be ready to put anyone else's needs before your own, not a child, not mine. Ann? Scotty. Hi. Martin, this is Scotty Turner. He works for the State Department. Scotty, this is my... Martin Bauer. Martin, it's a pleasure to meet you. I came as soon as I heard. Ann, I am so sorry you got caught in the crossfire again. Maybe we should just get you out of here. Scotty? Would you mind giving us a second to finish our business? Yeah, sure. I'm sorry. I understand. Here, I got these for you, Ann. Thank you. I'll just be down the hall. Is there any guy in this country who's not trying to sleep with you? Get out. Look, I'm sorry, just... Get out. OK. When did you become such an asshole? At the exact moment you packed your last bag and you left. Take care of yourself. The bites have faded. It's amazing. No, that's a miracle. Happy bar mitzvah? Well, they were all out of sorry you got shot while I was running my ass off, so. Well, it works. Thanks for coming. Least I could do for the one who got shot. And how do I look? Not bad. Have you seen North? I have a backhand with his name on it. No, he's gone. He flies to New York today. What? Why? Yesterday, he goes out to where we got jacked and he comes back with a sealed crate. Today, he fly. Did you see what was in the crate? No, he wouldn't let anyone near it. Why? Let's take a ride, Raka. Sure appreciate this, sir. A lot. Perfect. You know we're putting ourselves in danger by going back there. Raka, I'm a reporter. I've got to do my job. Just drive. Ann? Yeah? You don't remember much about the night you got shot, do you? No, not much. Why? You do remember getting chased though, right? Yeah. They're back. Get us the hell out of here. Come on. Just whose cornflakes did you piss in? Why do you think it's me? Because everybody love Raka. I got an idea. When I yell \ "now, \" brace yourself. Anytime you're ready. Don't rush. In 3, 2, 1, now. And your story is going to get us killed. They are not going to let you carry it on. Don't worry. It will fit under my seat. Yeah, and about seven others. I'm not hearing you. She's right, you know. Excuse me? This airline allows for a maximum carry-on girth of 62 inches, which is the total length, width, and height of the bag. Your surfboard's too long. Told ya. This is a Dewey Weber. It does not travel with baggage. Your fly is down. United Flight 777 to Los Angeles is now boarding at gate 53. This is the final boarding call for Interamerica's flight 71 to New York City. But it's a Dewey Weber. I don't care if it's a Denzel Washington. It rides downstairs. Hello. Thank you. All I can tell you is we gave our best. OK, you gave it your best. That's all a man can do. Stay put. I'll pick you up. - Yes, sir. Roger that. Thank you. No problem. 10-4. Yeah, Buzzard? This is E. - Yes, sir. Go for Buzzard. Over. I think we've located our problem tribe. There's no time to get our project to site. I need fire power in the air. Right away, sir. Requesting coordinates. Over. OK, Ann. Before I go back to the Jeep, what are we looking for? We're looking for what North found. And that is? You're a leper. Come on, Raka. Be serious. I'm seriously not following. Look, if I know North, he thinks that whatever gave me these delightful hickies also caused my rapid recovery. And that could be worth a pretty penny in New York. And I think it might be what our friends in the dune buggy were trying to protect. Ezekial, you son of a bitch. Run! Welcome on board to Interamerica's flight 71 to New York City. We'll try to make the next 10 hours of flight as pleasant as possible. I've been informed we have some turbulence for about the first 100 miles, but we should be able to get through that pretty quick. Please, if you would, keep your seatbelts fastened. Refrain from using any personal electronics here until we get out of the rough stuff. Thanks for flying Interamerica. Sir? Sir? Yes? Your laptop? Yes, it is. Thanks for asking. The hell was that? Shit. Is that what I think it is? Ideas? No. This has not been my week. Demons from the sky. Let's get the hell out of here. You know, three years traveling to this backward-ass continent, I've yet to finish a complete drink. Jesus Christ. You guys try to hit every bump or what? Shit. Shit. Shit. Have... have Bonnie and Michelle check on the passengers. Yes, sir. Interamerica passengers flight 71, this is your captain speaking. Sorry for the bumpy ride. We'll try to avoid any more turbulence in the future. In the meantime, please keep your seatbelts fastened and refrain from moving around the cabin. Thank you. Have you ever seen anything like that? Yeah. I just forgot to tell you. Wonder if there's any openings for cameramen in the Middle East. Pick up the phone, lunatic. You don't mind if I answer this, do you? I think we're out of the rough stuff. Be my guest. Thanks. Hello? Maniac. You didn't do what I think you did? Ann? Hi, how are you? You didn't do it, did you? You haven't read about the honey shortage in New York, have you? It's a terrible thing. Are you out of your mind? Do you have any idea what those bees can do? Do I know what they can do? Sweetheart, you were covered with stings from them and your tissue healed at a remarkable rate. You know, by all rights, you should be dead now. More times than you'll know. Do you have any idea what this little find will be worth to the pharmaceutical community? And I'm sure you understand this couldn't possibly be trusted to some third-world facility. No. Only the best for my little bee-auties. You sick monkey. You've got to... Ann, we're breaking up. I think we're going into a tunnel. Look, when I get to New York, I'll give you a buzz. Asshole. Women. Scott Turner. Scotty, big problem. Ann, what's wrong? Something very dangerous is on a plane to New York right now. Hold on. Slow down now. What plane and what's dangerous? Bees, Scotty, killer bees. No, he's coming this way. We weren't properly introduced. I'm Adam. What did you say your name was? I didn't. She's Sandy. Quit it. So Sandy, maybe when we get back to New York, we could get together, you know, for dinner maybe. Dinner? Breakfast too, depending on how it goes. Alex? Adam. Adam. Can I be blunt with you? I prefer it. Good. Because I'd rather run my towel over a midget wrestler's hair butt than spend one more second this close to a geek like you. OK, Alex? You just lost your chance at dinner. Deep regret. Sir. I'll be out in a snap, OK? Hey. Hey. Well, that's the third one we've passed. What's that? A deserted town. Where are all the people? You know, it's a reasonable question. This whole thing gets weirder and weirder. Turn on your phone, you bloody idiot. Mister? Yeah? Can I ask you a question? Well, you can't jump in front. No. It's more like advice. Advice? Not exactly the father knows best type, if you know what I mean. That's all right. Do you understand women? I mean, like, how to treat them so that they'll like you? I'll tell you what. You give me your number. And when I figure women out, I'll call you. Great. Yeah. So expect a call in, like, never. Thanks. No problem. Maybe I'll just stick to my computers. What is that guy doing in there? What's that? Probably hemorrhoids. You ready for this, Casper? What did he say? Well, you did get your hickies from the demons from the sky, which makes you highly unpopular with the townspeople because you should be six feet under. Right. Rumor has it that after you were stung, you were taken away by shadow people. Wonderful. Are you OK? Shit. Get the captain. You want to look for the shadow people? Absolutely. Why? Well, it's obvious. They must have a serum. They saved my life with something. That's great. They can open a drugstore, call it Spook and Save. Raka. - Ann, they could be cannibals. Raka, if those bees get out on that plane, hundreds could die. And if they breed in New York, it could be millions. That's not fair. All right, but I'm driving. Well, just, you know, heard this really loud bang and then he came out like that. Did you hear anything else? Just the electric shaver, that's it. Have you seen my headphones? Yes. There they are, my dear, down there. Now what the hell's going on? You have to warn the pilot. Ann, my people have been trying. Interamerica hasn't heard of any problems with that flight. They're inclined to let them complete the trip and handle the situation in New York. Scotty, if they don't bring that plane back soon, it's going to be out over the water. And if anything does happen, they're screwed. I know. I know. And we are working on it, OK? Now, shouldn't you be resting? Yeah, well I have to meet some people first. What people? Shadow people. What? What, are you kidding me? No, I wish I were. You know where they are? Well, I think so. The shaman told Raka. Why? I don't know. I just heard they were hard to find, that's all. Why are you looking for them? Well, I think they must have an antidote. If anything does happen, we have to be ready. Got to let us know what's going on. In a minute, sir. Are you sure? This is the third time I've been over the passenger list. If there's a doctor on this flight, he doesn't want to be known. Captain, we got to land this thing. You're in my chopper. I'll have a beer or two. Buzzard? Si? Yes, sir. Go for Buzzard. Over. - Yeah. We've got a problem. A little bit of our project has flown the coop. Sao Paolo, this is Interamerica 71. We have a medical emergency on board, two passengers down. Need medical assistance, authorization return. Over. Flight 71, maintain current course. The hell is going on down there? Well, sir, let me give you three reasons why you hired me. I know how to improvise. I'm quick on my feet. And I'm a natural born asshole. Why don't you guys go back to your seats? I can look after him for a while. What now? Somebody help me. He's choking. Come on. Get it out. Come on. Get it out. There you go. Get him a glass of water, would you? All right. Just breathe, OK? Deep breaths, you're going to be OK. Breathe. Mr. Bauer? Yeah, kid? I think you need to see this. What is it, chicken wing? No. It's a bee. Bee? A bee? My god. You. Yes, me. Molested anybody else's wife lately? Stay back. How about if I just wipe that smirk off your face right here in first class? You don't know what you're dealing with. No. You don't know what you're dealing... This isn't helping, morons. Fellas? What? Look. Got a bee on your neck, pal. Get it off! You OK? Here, take this. You're going to get a call. What? This is Interamerica's flight 71. Come in, Sao Paolo tower. Any ideas? Well, all the attacks have occurred in coach. So maybe if we move everybody up to first class and try to find some way to seal it off, maybe that will work. Might buy us some time. All right. You're in charge out there. OK. OK, executive decision. Let's turn this around and head back. I'm not going over water like this. Something that shaman told me back in town kind of freaked me out. What's that? Legend has it that the shadow people are led by a white demon named Savior. Yeah? And the shaman told me that Savior carried you in his arms. Now, you're possessed by him. So I've got that going for me. My god, it's ringing. This will never work. Yeah, got any better ideas? Duct tape. Look, maybe if you just stop bitching. Mr. Bauer? Yeah? Continue this later. Yeah, hello? You stupid asshole. Call me an asshole, bitch. Martin? Ann? You know that person? It's my wife. Great, his wife. Maybe my mommy will call next. She'll let us land. You want to shut up so I can hear? Marty? Ann, calling to talk to your boyfriend? That pompous ass is not my boyfriend. What are you doing? Here? Well I just figured our reconciliation went so well that I should probably go back home and clean the pizza boxes off your side of the bed. You are such a jerk. Look, Ann. I'm kind of busy here right now, so. Martin, it's really important that I speak to Dr. North. Well, I don't think you're going to have a very enlightening conversation. You see, Dr. North is doing his best not to swallow his own tongue. My god, the bees got out? How in the hell do you know about that? It's too long to explain. Is anybody else hurt? Yeah. We got four down so far. And from the looks of them, I don't even think they're going to make the meal. Listen, I don't think we can keep the bees out of the cabin much longer. We got to land this thing. Well, I'm working on that. And I think I found a serum. We'll meet you wherever you land. Deal. It will be good to see you again. Yeah? You too. Bye. Bye. Scott Turner. Scotty, how come that plane is not on the ground yet? I told you. We are trying. We are trying very hard. For Christ's sake, what was that? I'm going to have to get back to you. Ann? Ann? - So now what? Walk, I guess. I was afraid you were going to say that. Raka? - Ann? We're more than 100 miles from the eastern border, aren't we? Probably two. And the new superhighway is only supposed to run 100 miles, right? That's what I heard in the news. So why is there all this road construction equipment way out here? - That's a good question. Let's go. All right. How's it going? Done? Well, as done as I could do with duct tape and blankets. Let's take a look. Your controls. OK. Thanks for the info. Out. I know why they won't let us land. I just talked to a friend of mine over at Ecuadorian Internationals. Rumor is we're carrying a type of virus, like the Ebola or something. - What? Somebody got a call from the US. State Department confirming. US State Department? No one's ever going to let us land if they think we have a virus on board. Looks like we're on our own up here. Can help you, sir? I'm sure you can. I'm positive there's a passenger that needs a barf bag or a pillow. Why don't you go find... I think everyone is OK, sir. Why don't you return to your seat? No can do, sky waitress. I'm here to see the captain. Well, he's very busy now, sir. Look, Kristi, love. You either move out of my way or I'm going to be forced to put you on the low rent section of this bus. Do you know what I mean? Of course I do, sir. Now, let me tell you what I need. First, the name is Michelle, not Kristi, love. Second, this is Interamerica's flight number 71, not some rickety, old southern bus. Third, when I tell you to take your seat, it is for your safety, as well as the safety of others around you. Sir, we're going to be landing soon. Let me put your tray in it's... locked position. Thank you for flying Interamericas. Have a nice day. Now what? Let's go check the blankets. Tell him we're not going to hurt him. I understand he's a shaman. He must be a proud man. Is he wise too? Do you know who I am? I'm the asshole. Ask him about the shadow people. Where are they? Por favor. Por favor. Por favor my ass. I know you know where they are. Point it out on the map. Do you know what this is? It shoots people. Sir, you're wasting our time here. He doesn't know. Now, this kid, he's got a three-year-old daughter. I know him and I don't even know you. Once upon a time. Eenie, meenie, miney, mo. Shadow people. Hey, Mr. Ezekial, take a look at this place. These aren't the coordinates the shaman gave me. Looks like someone screwed up. Buzzard? It's E. - Yes, sir. I'm in the air. Go ahead. I have another assignment for you. Burn them down. - Yes, sir. Requesting coordinates. Over. I thought you could use a pick me up. Great. Thanks, Bonnie. No problem. So far we've got, you know, everything sealed off from here on down, but I don't know how we're going to get behind this... Get him off the control. Shit. Holy shit. Rick? My god. How the... Look. Get... get it. Mr. Bauer? What is that? I don't think our friends liked that last bump in the road. God. Shit. Going to need some help here. My god. Naomi. Eat this and that. Come on. You want a piece of this? And that, you want some of this? You don't want none of this. Come and get some of this. Take that and that. Buzzard, it's E. Go for Buzzard. The ocean is out. Our vitamin bee project has made an unscheduled U-turn. Can you drop them somewhere else? Recommendation, sir? Somewhere nice and quiet. How about Negro? Over. - Sounds good to me. Right, sir. - 10-4. This is Buzzard out. I love this job. That could be them. Do you ever get the feeling that we're... Ann? I do not like this. I'm with you. Come on. Ideas? Just got to think. I have an idea. Yeah? Run. Go, go, go. Think we lost him. I think we lost him. What? Game over. This is not good. Any other bright ideas? None right now. I'll let you know. Hi, fellas. Is there an Ann Bauer with us? What the hell was that? Is there an Ann Bauer with us? So you're breaking hearts way out here too? I'm Ann Bauer. Ann Bauer, nice to see you when you're not bleeding to death. I'm Savior. Meet the shadow people. How's everybody doing? Well, the bathroom guy's just about gone. What about you? I can't even get anybody to answer me anymore. It's like we're the pariah of the sky. The natives are getting restless back there. What do you want me to tell them? Tell them to screw it. I can't set her down now because there's mountains all over. An hour south of here is farm land. It should be bumpy, but safe. I'm setting her down. OK. Careful. You think those are there to freak me out? Because if they are, it's working. Those are Okupis, poison dart frogs. Poison dart frogs, great. Their bile is dipped on the tips of darts, strongest poison in the jungle. Ann, if that's the strongest poison in the jungle, why is she putting it in drinking jugs? 7165 west, 0079 north. Got that? Is it clear? You'll see us half a click away from the village. 10-4. But you're a doctor. A small and exclusive practice. This is ridiculous. I wish you had not come, Ann Bauer. Well, I didn't have a choice. You have the serum. If you don't help us, everyone on that plane will be dead. I have greater concerns than that. Greater concerns? Much. I'm trying to save a region that is being systematically destroyed by your kind. Pollution from your factories is killing our people, poisoning our river, driving us from our land. You're killing us for your precious oil. This is one small example of your government's policy of sacrificing the environment for corporate greed. Savior, I'm on your side. These are ordinary people. This isn't about politics. Blank people, they're not my concern. Blank people? Blank people... blank in color, blank in honor, blank in soul, blank. Savior, please. My... someone very close to me is on that plane. Blank. No. He's OK, right? He's OK, right? Come here. We're going to get out of here. I promise. It's OK. One potato, two potato, three potato. All right, boys, make some noise. Now I must ask you to go and never return. Savior, give us the serum. We'll leave and I swear we'll never return. You idiot, you were followed. Yeah, boss? We're getting no resistance here. I think five minutes should do it. Nothing like a few well-placed rounds. Ann Bauer. Ann, read about you in the paper. You hurt? Ann? Son of a... Sorry, you were saying? You're the guy who does the videos? Who do you think you are? Are you like a genius or a fool? This is my business. Nobody gets to shoot anything or anybody without my permission. Kiss my ass. You know what this is? It's a gun that can kill you very quickly. Raka! Nice shooting, Pedro. The hell is going on here, Ezekial? Thank god. This man is crazy. Sorry, we're just cleaning up the mess. Scotty. Just give me a second, Ann. So this is Savior. God, I have been looking forward to meeting you, sir. All right. All of them, outside, now. Why, Scotty? Reasonable request. I'll indulge. Buddy Savior's been a huge pain in the poo-poo with these raids on our oil interests. Now, with the cross-country highway going in, we couldn't have any more of his shenanigans. What? Cross country? - Ann? What happened to 100 miles, separate but protected? Well, we really couldn't call it Operation Manifest Destiny now, could we? Think of the PR. No, no, no. That road's going cross country, sweetheart, all along the Amazon. Ann, what's going on? But why? Ann, do you have any idea the amount of oil in that region? More than Texas and Alaska. We need a protected shipping lane. We can't have these savages taking over any time they want. No, no. That costs money. So all this is about a little bit of money? No, Ann. This is about a great deal of money. $14 billion these low lifes have cost American businesses. I think that quite frankly, enough's enough. How do the bees come in? Well, we needed a clean way to clear the people from our jungle. So you went au natural? Right. We genetically engineered these babies, breeding only the meanest, the toughest. And we engineered in a very short lifespan, only about a week and a half. They're better than chemical weapons because they leave no fingerprints. In fact, they're the perfect soldiers. They... they kill fast, then they die. You sound like a proud father. I am. And I am also very proud of you too. Really? Yes, really. We've been looking for old pale face and his posse here for some time. Who'd have thought the chick I was trying to bang would lead me right to him? I'd get that foot out of my head if I were you. Pity. Anyway, the only thing we didn't count on was your Doctor Daffy taking home bit of our project as a souvenir. Which reminds me, what is the status of that plane? They're waiting for your word, sir. Good. Shoot it down. Martin, you have to land the plane. Bitch. Ann? Damn it. Captain, we got a major problem. Buzzard? Go for Buzzard. Shoot that puppy down. You got to put it down. And where do you suggest I do that? How should I know? I'm not the pilot. You are. - We're over mountains. There's nowhere. Yeah, well, I don't know about you, but I'd rather take my chances with mountains than missile. Well, maybe you should fly the goddamn plane. All right, well, maybe I should. Hey, guys? I've been listening. I got an idea. Hey. Am I going to die? Yes, you are, just not today. I'm sorry, just tell me again. Well, it's actually quite simple. Every plane has an onboard computer, right? So? So the onboard computer generates a signal so that air traffic knows where we are. And this is probably locked on to that right now. So you're going to turn off that signal? No, I don't think I want to do that. I'm going to duplicate it, you know, screw with the missile's mind. This thing won't let me in. I got the missile, 100 miles in closing. Check your gloves, check your boots, make sure that absolutely no skin is showing. Ezekial? Sir, bees are allergic to me. Whatever. Let's do this. Looking over my shoulder is definitely not helping. Goodbye, Ann. Goodbye, Savior. Scotty? There's a little problem with your plan. You do know I found an antidote? Did you now? Yeah, I did. It's all around you. Give me a little hint. Poison from the Okapi frog, dart poison. Bees hate it, won't come near it. 70 miles. OK, and then... Now what? Now we screw with its mind. Come on, duplicate. Duplicate. See, Okapi poison not only acts as a repellent, it breaks down the bees' venom before it can shut down major organs. Amazing thing is, I found out later, it also speeds up tissue regrowth. Gave some to Ann the night these bastards shot her. Really helped with her healing. 55 miles. Keep doing it. Going as fast as I can. Now, I want you... Get the hell off my land. Look. It's working. How far? 40 miles. 30 miles. Seven miles. It's going to be close. Boy, you're ugly. One mile. Hang on. No, no, no, no, no. Pull it back. I'm trying. Pull it back. You got it. I got it. - You got it. Yeah! Yeah. Yeah! Yeah! It's Ann. Hey. Martin? I don't think I've ever been this thrilled to hear your voice. Yeah, well, same here. We literally dodged a bullet on that one, thanks to you. No charge. Actually, you can pay me back later. I'll be the one with the serum. I can't wait. I love y... Ann? Yeah. How are we supposed to get this stuff to the plane? We will walk if we have to. We're going to try. Ann. This is going to save lives, doctor, human lives, flesh and blood. You know, a real doctor still gives a shit about human lives, blank or not. You know, flew medivacs in 'Nam, '68 through '71. Got over 500 kids out. If there's a helicopter I can't fly, I ain't found it yet. Let's go. I'm afraid I got some bad news on my end. What's happened? Explosion cracked a line. We're losing fuel. Great. I'm open to ideas, but I think we have to land, take our chances. These can't get everybody. I have an idea. There you go, just like riding a bike. I hope not. Why? I always crash my bikes. You're talking about opening a door of a plane in flight. We'll start to drop, possibly even crash. Well, not before the bees are sucked out. OK. Who's the idiot who's going to open the back door? If he doesn't get stung to death, he's probably going to get sucked out with the bees. Mr. Idiot, at your service. Shit. Flight 71. This is Savior on route with serum and med supplies. Say heading and altitude, please. Over. - Hello, Savior. This is flight 71 heading 300 and flight level 125, approximately three miles southwest of Lago Dos Pedros. Over. Roger that, flight 71. Should be in position to rendezvous in approximately seven minutes. Copy that, Savior. See you soon. Why did you and your husband break up? Martin always cared more about himself than anyone else. And that doesn't make for a good father. I never looked at him and thought, you're my hero. I need that. There they are. Yeah? Guess what I'm looking at right now. I got no clue. The rear end of a plane. Yeah? Listen, Ann, I've been thinking. Now listen to me, OK? I'm serious. I think I'm ready. Ready for what? You know, you, me, baby makes three, you know, Sundays at the park, you know, the whole thing. Martin. You know... You know, weekends at Coney Island. Martin? Or you know, sports. I mean, you don't have any problems with pee wee football, do you? - Martin? What? How about dinner? No commitments further than that, OK? OK. See you on the ground. Yeah. Yeah. Bye. We got to do this now. Make sure you tie yourself down with anything that you have. We will be opening the rear door and it will become very windy. OK, Rick, I'm all set and ready to go. Are you ready? OK, let's do this thing. All right. On three. One, two, three. Shit. Look. Martin? Shit. Mr. Bauer! Mr. Bauer, grab my hand. Climb, Martin. Come on. Climb, climb. You're almost there. Grab my hand. All right. Mr. Bauer? Yeah. Adam, you are beautiful. All passengers, take your seats now. Interlace your fingers behind your neck and put your head between your knees. This is going to be a very bumpy landing. You did it, you son of a bitch. Rick? Please take your seat. My god. OK, if you're going to sit up here, you got to work. No problem. Just got to tell me what to do. What's our altitude? Where? Dial in the center. Just under 2,000 feet. Now, lower the landing gear. Where? Lever by your left knee. Yeah. That's it. Done. They're landing, Savior. They're landing. Rick? Rick! Pull back on the throttle, lever in the center. Easy, easy. OK, sorry. It's my first time. OK. - How's that? That's great. When we hit the ground, you push that lever by your left foot down with all your might. You got it. Hold on. Hold on. Get ready. It's going to be a rough one. My god, we're alive. We made it. My god, we made it. Yeah! Yeah! There we go, little one. Yeah. Feels pretty good, doc? Yeah, blank or not. Hey. Raka, this is Martin Bauer. This is my husband. The hero. The hero. All right, bee stings. Sure, yeah. What do you say we get out of here? Fabulous idea. Was that it? Is what it? Is that how you treat a woman? That's it. So that's how you treat a woman. Thanks, Mr. B.
