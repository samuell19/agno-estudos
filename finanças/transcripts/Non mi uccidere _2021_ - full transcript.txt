No, straight. A little more, too much! Okay, straight. No, right. Open your eyes, please. Shut up and guide me. You're crazy! There's a tractor, Robin. It's huge! Open your damn eyes! Go right! Right! It's coming! What a blast! Don't throw a tantrum. Don't you realize you went too far? Joking around is different from almost killing us. You sound like your dad. I guess he's right. Then go live with your parents again. You know that deep down I like that life. I could meet a guy they'd approve of. Why don't you quit? Because you told me to? That's not how it works. If I told you to get high, you wouldn't do it. And what if I did? I don't want you to. Well, I want to. Why? To spite me? No, to feel what you feel. This stuff is hardcore. Together, but just this once. Only if you promise this will be your last time too. Maybe. Please. Don't kill me. No matter what happens, we'll be together forever. Not even death will separate us, I promise. If we die, we'll come back. We'll come back. -Nobody's come for him. -I'm not surprised. He took our daughter. She would've wanted to be buried with him. What? We owe her this, as her last wish. She never would've done this if it weren't for him. I don't want her all alone in that coffin. Stop it! I will not allow it! Enough. We'll never get her back again. MIRTA FOSSATI 19.02.2002 - 24.03.2020 Where are you going all alone in the woods, pretty girls? -To drink a Coke. -Let's go together. Your truck's already full. Come on, at least tell me where you're going? We don't hang with junkies. Don't be so bitchy, I'm not trying to kidnap you. Is she like you? That's none of your business. Is she mute? She bit off her tongue when she saw you, now scram. We'll meet up again soon. Come on! Yeah! The guy in the back? Robin. All the girls like him, but we don't. Fuck! I'm leaving, bye. Miranda! What are you doing? Let me go. Put me down, please. Stop, stop. -I want to go in. -You can't, my dad will kill us. -Then let's go to my place. -I can't. -I'll walk with you up to there. -Lower your voice. And watch you go in. And I want to watch you leave. Go. -I want to keep watching you. -No, it'll take forever. Mirta. Mirta. It's me, Mom. It's Mom. I know you're there. Open up. Mirta. Open up. You're freezing. Amalia? Stay here. Mirta, it's all right. Amalia? Mirta! Mirta! Amalia. -Mirta. -Amalia. Amalia. Mirta! Mirta? Where are you, Mirta? I don't want to hurt you. Where are you hiding? Mirta. Come on, come out. I want to protect you. Be a good girl and come out. We want to protect you, Mirta. Mirta. THE BENANDANTI WISH YOU A GOOD WALK You're not from here, are you? I'd remember you. A babe like you is hard to forget. I bet you're a student majoring in literature. I'm an engineer, I remodel expensive mansions. Hot, right? You're hot, too. Why don't we get out of here? You think you can find someone better than me? Sorry, she gets first dibs. Mirta. Amalia. -Amalia. -Mirta. Mr. Fossati, someone's here asking for you. All right, Susy, be right there. Sorry for coming by so late, Mr. Fossati, but it's about your daughter. My daughter is gone. You're wrong. Have you heard of the "Benandanti"? No, who are they? We're a group of people who secretly pass down a task. To protect the living. Protect them… from whom? Do you really believe someone stole Mirta's body? The police said so. You think the police believe that the dead come back to life? If that were so, there would be no reason for us to exist. Your daughter is still among us, Mr. Fossati. Sorry. My daughter is dead. My wife is losing her mind, and you come here saying she's come back to life? How dare you? Who are you? You sicken me. Get out before I call the cops. Leave, get out! Call me when you see her. Because you will see her, Mr. Fossati. And don't trust her. She's not the Mirta you knew. What the fuck is this place? Where'd you think we'd go? Well, you must live somewhere. I live nowhere. Listen, let's start over, okay? I'm Mario, what's your name? Luna. Luna… sure, whatever. Will you take off those glasses? For fuck's sake! I've been chasing you all night. So, what'll it be? No… Hold on. Hold on, it's okay. We were just warming up. Look at this little surprise Mario has for you. You weren't expecting this, were you? Here, Luna, take a hit. You think I haven't realized that you're a junkie? Now don't be a bitch. You stink like shit. I said take off those fucking glasses. Want money? How much? Two, three, ten? All of it? Here, take it. You gave me a hard-on, come here. Don't be a pain in the ass. Come here. Want to play? Want to play? Want to wrestle? I've fucked lots of girls like you. But you win the prize for most doped up. Mirta, look at me. Quit playing victim. Bare your fangs or people will walk all over you, understand? Where do you think I come from? Think mommy and daddy helped me? I'm alone. I learned how to defend myself early on. Because they'll take it all away, Mirta. Even friends, real ones. They'll take them away, too. That's what happened to me. Now I have you. It's the two of us. Good morning, and now for our special edition with some breaking news. The body of a man was found in his car at the so-called "Luna" quarry. His name is Mario Cerruti, age 40, married with two children. Let's go to our correspondent for more. A year after Paolo De Liguori's murder, we're back at the place local youngsters call the "Luna" quarry where another violent crime has occurred. First the 25-year-old, now Mario Cerruti who was killed last night… Hello? Hello, who is this? Hello? If you trust me, we'll be together forever. Don't say things like that. Why? Because I'll believe you. Not like that. Slow down. I want to look at you. Slow down. Nice. I didn't picture it like this. How much did this setup cost you in rent? Hey. Piero. Hey. No. No, wait. I knew she came here to take drugs with him. And what did I do? I paid her rent. I know. -Stop. -No. Stop it. Listen. I won't say she had it coming, but I'm not surprised. -Meaning? -It's not your fault. She made that choice, Mirta did. Whatever, let's hurry up. I want to get out of here. Fine. You know I'm right anyway. Susy? Susy? Mirta. Get on, quick. If I don't take them out, they might start hurting. -Painful? -A little. Not like when you were alive. Relax, I'm a surgeon. -What do you want? -To save you. From yourself. You did a good job defending yourself from all those assholes. I'm already dead, what can they do to me? There are worse things than death. They're called "Benandanti." It's a sect that's been hunting us since the 1600s. At first, they hunted down witches or presumed witches, but now they mainly hunt us. They're organized. They have means, money, manpower. They know what to do and how to not leave a trace. They tell witnesses they're a government organization, but if someone sees too much, they get rid of them. Nobody has ever seen their HQ, but they have secret branches worldwide. Their main mission is to wipe out the Overdead. The Overdead? Kids who come back to life after a violent death. Like you. And me. You, too? Are there others? You're not the only one. Thanks. Next time we'll find a better place, all right? Hey. What's on your mind? My dad. Why? Why were they so vicious? Maybe you haven't realized it, but we're the vicious ones now. Let go! But then again, it wasn't our choice. One night I was going home after work and came across a group of kids who were drunk. They cornered me, threw me to the ground, and I defended myself… fiercely. Let go! So fiercely that to keep me still… Shut up! …they had to kill me. That's why I'm ridding humanity of these shitty pests now. It's important to learn how to not kill them right away. I'll teach you this hold later. When they're unconscious, they're easier to handle and you reduce the risk of them dying of a heart attack. I assume you know this is one of the best parts. This is where we instinctively bite at first. But beware, if the victim's spinal cord is injured, they'll die instantly. And above all, you'll risk severing the artery. In that case, you have three to five minutes before they die. And then… -We can't eat them anymore. -Exactly. Only when they're alive. It's best to start at the abdomen. Liver, intestine, stomach. But avoid the abdominal aorta and diaphragm. They won't die quickly and you'll have time to eat your fill. With this method, several Overdead can feed on one body. Really? Dig in. They know we have a car, so don't get comfy, we'll have to find another. Can't we stop and hide here? Mirta, don't you get it? They're on our asses, if you want to be safe quit yapping and just trust me. Let's go back to the cemetery. I need to be there when Robin wakes up, I promised. Robin, Robin, who the fuck is Robin? Your first? Your only? That's why you're obsessed. Listen, if you died together and he didn't wake up, then your Robin's not coming back. Not everyone comes back. Not everyone comes back. I'm not leaving without him. Mirta, you're not a normal Overdead, you're even stronger. They know it, that's why so many of them showed up. We'll go back if and when things cool off. My decision is final. No. Ago. Mirta? I'm here. It's me. Am I fucking tripping? I'm real. This coke is insane. So you're like a zombie? Yes, but less fucked-up. You kill to eat? My body changes if I don't eat. And I feel sick. You kill then eat them? No, they have to be alive. The dead don't eat the dead. Do I scare you? No. I'm surrounded by the dead. You, Robin… Pac-Man. Everyone knows him as "Paolo De Liguori, the quarry victim." Robin said he was eaten by a sort of vampire or werewolf. He never talked about it. They were best friends. I always came second to him, I was number two. No, he loved you. Sure. but when he met you, he stopped talking to me and started hanging with weirdos. Who? Weirdos. I don't care what you are. I'm just glad you're back. I can't. I might hurt you. I don't care, I've been waiting for years. Please, take me back to the cemetery. No. Please, stay with me. Please. Please. Sit down, and we'll have a drink. Okay? Time out. You're not eating me. I might come back. Maybe I'll come back too. And so, we'll be together again. No! She wasn't at the cemetery, let me see if she's here. It's just a precaution. Sorry, sweetie. Don't call me that. I haven't introduced myself. Luca Bertozzi, Benandante. Kill me. It's not that easy to kill you a second time. But we can stop you from eating so you decompose. You creatures are very powerful. But now we can defeat you. An Overdead has become our ally. Robin. Did you hurt her? Me? Nope. -Where are we? -In our hideout. Everything's fine, we're safe. I was afraid I'd never see you again. I did horrible things. I know. I'm an Overdead too. What do these people have to do with us? What about your friend? Tell me. An Overdead slaughtered him. I was there. But I couldn't save him. We were junkies and nobody cared that he died. I couldn't sleep or eat. I was lost. The Benandanti gave me a new purpose. To get revenge on the monsters who ruined my life. But as luck would have it, I met you. And I couldn't live without you. You were the best thing that ever happened to me. You killed me. You knew we would die in that car. And I knew we would come back. Stronger… forever. You didn't even ask me. What does it matter? Soon you'll be free of this curse. You'll see. I can still taste your leg. Mirta… Oh God! Let's go eat. Fuck. Stay down! Down! Down! I really hope it was worth it. Get in. How dare you decide for me, shithead! You wanted it, too. You promised me, remember? I've become a monster. I gave you a great gift. Dying is a gift? Mirta. Mirta. Mirta is gone. You killed her. Still thinking about him? How can I not? Anger will give you the strength to survive. You'll start understanding what you are and you'll be surprised. You'll have to keep hiding and pick your victims carefully. It won't be hard.
