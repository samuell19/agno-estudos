He ain't got no money. Looking lovey as usual, Mrs. Johnson. Well, thank you, Joey. You know that mouth of yours gets sweeter and sweeter with every card. How about me, Joey? Nice sweater, Mrs. Perkins. I keep telling you to call me Yollette. Yollette. So any plan for the holidays, ladies? Cooking for my family as usual. Yeah, I'll do something with my daughter and my granddaughter, but if I'm being honest, I haven't really been feeling the holiday spirit since my husband passed. Well, I'll tell you what, you gonna get into the holiday spirit and see the holy ghost if you win that hand. Well, hallelujah. And what about you, Joey, what are you doing for the holidays? - Me? - Mmhmm. Now, you know we might have a little age on you, but we ain't blind. - Just a little bit. - Just a little bit. We know you ain't single, with all of that thunder under that jacket. Wow, that's a lot. I'll be right here working. We have customers 24/7, and for some folks, we're all the family they have. Blackjack, darling. Pay up, pay up. What can I say? I am on a roll. You too. Come on, give it to mama. Come on. Yes, boy. That's it, that's it. That's fine, that's fine. I got some more. Okay, come on. Let's keep going. What we got? Here, take some of mine. All right, yes! Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme. I'm a winner. Anybody want a toast, want a toast? - That's right, hey. - No, you ain't feeling it? Okay, that's fine. All right, you know what? I'm gonna go all in. Let's go ahead on it. Let's do this. Come on. Have I give you some of mine? I'm feeling myself. I'm feeling myself. Yes, come on. Come on, Joey. - Come on. - Come on, Joey - Come on. - Come on, Joey. No, no, no, I'm good. Oh. Oh. Can't win them all, Mrs. Johnson. Dolores, you ready to go? Why? The night's still young. We've only been at the table... For three hours. Okay, well, who is counting? Listen, okay, because I came here to win and have some fun. Well, I'm going to leave with more than what I came with, and you should too. Don't get it twisted. It looks like I'm down on my luck now. Does not mean I can't make a comeback. Ain't that right, Joe. Absolutely. Mrs. Johnson. And don't forget, you still owe me the 200 from the last time we were here. Really, Yollette? Really, right now? Okay, there, girlfriend. Are you coming? For the last time, no, I am not. Let's play. Suit yourself. Merry Christmas. Mmhmm, Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Yollette. Mmhmm. Okay, now that Debbie Downer is gone. Deal me two hands, Joe, and make it snow. All right, so, guess tonight wasn't my night after all. Do you know what? I will be back to get it back.

That'll be really nice. Yeah, I don't think so, honey. Ma, are you sure? Sure, I'm sure. Listen, I just can't imagine traveling any great distance without your father. Grandma, it'd be a blast. That's what Disneyland's for, honey. Mom, there's so many memories of daddy in the house. Leaving for a bit might do you some good? Oh, thank you. Not yet, okay? Grandma, memories never go away. They stay right here in your heart. And you're right, honey. Like remember how Grandpa used to read me twice a night before Christmas or the story about the corn husk angel that your mom made you when you were a little girl in Jamaica. And you know what? I still have that. Ooh, I love you to pieces, princess, but I need you to understand that my soul is still a little blue. But Pastor said, when you're under the weather, you have to make your own sunshine. Marsha's right, mom, you usually have all your Christmas cards mailed out and your decorations up the day after Thanksgiving. We can help, Grandma. Besides, it'll be fun, and I miss spending time with you. Yeah, you know I miss spending time with you too, sweetpea. Do you understand that I was married to Grandpa for 37 years? It's a long time to be married to one person, you know? He was my best friend. So weren't you lonely all by yourself? Ooh, I know. You should move in with us, right, Mommy? Your grandma knows she is always welcome. Okay, enough about me. How's work, Gloria. Oh, it's been good. It's busy. My secretary can barely keep up with the appointments. Between botox, derma fillers, laser lips. It's good, mom. Okay. I love it, and I am happy for your bank account, but I just, I don't understand why people do all that stuff that to their faces. You know, I wanna look the age I've earned. People just wanna look their best, especially around the holidays. All right, so you dating anyone yet? Mother. Oh, what? You are too beautiful and too young to be single. Just please, don't do one of those dating sites, though. I think they're dangerous. Ma, can we not talk about this in front of Marsha? What? I'm just saying. Grandpa gave that scarf to you. What? We went shopping for it two Christmases ago. You remember. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, honey. It's okay, Grandma. Once you put up your tree, everything will be fine. Oh goodness gracious, Marsha. I'm sure you know that Christmas is not just about trees and decorations, right? As a matter of fact, you know what? I'm keeping it real simple this year. I'm not even gonna do a tree, just the nativity scene. Pass me the scones, please. Mom, you can't be serious. Oh, why can't I be? And I don't wanna talk about it any further. Marsha and I signed up to volunteer for the church toy drive. That's nice. I'm sitting it out this year. I've cheered long enough. It's time for somebody else to take the lead. Marsha, honey, how are piano lessons going? I'm learning "Jingle Bells". Aw, that's sweet. You know, grandma is so proud of you, but I'm gonna need you to pick that bottom lip up off the floor, lift it, bottom lip up, lift it, lift it up off the floor, lift it. Marsha's piano teacher says she's a quick study. Well, that doesn't surprise me. She takes after her grandpa. You know your grandpa, God rest his soul, he was the pianist in the family. Now don't ask me why your mama had played to play the drums. Mommy, what are you doing? Let's, at least, split it. No, thank you. I've got it. It's on me. Okay, well, I guess you're doing all right then. What's that supposed to mean? What, what? Stop spying on me. Spying, what are you talking about? You don't need to check on me every time I go to the casino, okay? I can do what I wanna do when I want to do it. Mom, I know you're independent, but I get worried when you run off to those casinos, and you've been going a lot more lately. Okay, is that a problem? I don't know. Is it? I'm sorry, Ma'am. Your credit card was declined. And what, that can't be possible. Just run it again. You know how sometimes the strip... I ran it three time, Ma'am. Oh, well, that was stupid. Mommy. No, what, come on. Now, all those bank fraud whatchamacallits are gonna block all my cards. Give it, give it. Mommy, don't worry about it. I have it. Here you go, thank you, Ma'am. They don't teach them at waitress school? Oh God, I'm so embarrassed. It's okay, Grandma. Mommy's credit card was declined when we were at supermarket and she was divorcing daddy, and we had to leave the groceries right there, I mean, the ice cream and the hot wings and the butter and the eggs and the milk. Everybody was staring at us. Now that was embarrassing. Oh. Are we done, Marsha? You good? Tell me about that, honey. How about we all celebrate our time being together as a family and enjoy this Christmas tea like we used to do? - How about it? - Can we do that, please? Yes, toast, cheers? For family. Merry Christmas. Mrs. Johnson, there have been substantial withdrawals from your account over the last year. So. So two of your credit cards are maxed out, and the other flagged for suspicious activity. Hold on, so I treat my family to our annual Christmas tea and you call that suspicious? Last week, there were two cash withdrawals for $5,000 each. And why is that any of your business? My responsibility as your private banker is to advise you and to make sure your assets are protected. On a personal note, I understand everyone grieves differently. Why don't you get to the point, Ms. Patel? It says here you've applied for a $250,000 home equity loan. Are you remodeling? Okay, we're done here. Your husband's pension, social security, stocks, and the life insurance should be more than enough for you to live comfortably. Hold on, so are you trying to tell me how to spend my own money, Ms. Patel? I'm only advising against unnecessary debt at this stage in your life, and if you're not careful, there'll be nothing left. Noted. I can help create a budget if you like? No, I would not like. First, you humiliate me in front of my family, and now you think you are gonna put me on some type of an allowance? Over my dead body. I'm only trying to protect you. Girl, please, who do you think you are kidding? You are trying to make sure you keep my account and protect yourself. Okay, all right. Your card will be operational immediately. Oh, I know it will be. It shoulda' never been unoperational. What kind of bank business is this? Tell me how to spend my money. Happy holidays, Gloria, and I hate to bother you at work, but you told me to call if there was ever another emergency. Your mother just left here, and she's threatening to close all of her accounts. Your father named you co-trustee for a reason. Damn it. Where's the mail? She got but one thing to do but drop off my mail. Whoa, what the hell? Why is the mail always late? Ma'am, we are doing the best we can. It is the holiday. It is practically next year, and I'm still waiting on my pension check. A person can starve to death. Ma'am, to be honest, even when the check's on time, you still say it's late, so. Oh, did you... Ah, I found it. Thank you, Ma'am. Merry Christmas. I'm Graham, your new neighbor. Uh-huh, no time to chat. You move in safely here. Yes, Frank's pension check, finally. Uh-huh, oh, huh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Everybody wants their money, right, everybody. That was, what is this? Oh, what is this? Bring your poker face, because you have been dealt an exclusive invitation to Holiday Casino Night, Kingston, Jamaica? Saturday, December 11th at six o'clock. Yes, yes, yes, dress code, festival elegant, yes. I'm totally going. Yes, okay, okay. I can't miss this. All right, so, see, how am I gonna find $8,000 without that nosy banker in my business, ah? We can do this. We can absolutely do this. Come on. Yes, yes, the stars line up. Come on. Well, this a surprise. Is who died? No one died, Corrine. I can't just call my baby sister and wish her a happy holiday? So, what's up? Nothing's up. I mean, we haven't talked in a while. Years. Yeah, I mean, you sound great, by the way. You know how, working two job. Wait a minute, is Gloria, Marsha all right? Yeah, no, they're fine. Why does something always have to be wrong for me to call? We had just met, ya know? And you know you ain't never called to make no small talk. Well, you're right. All right, let me just get right to it. I wanna throw you a big birthday bash. You hit your head? Stop being salty, Corrine. I mean, it's your 50th. What kind of sister would I be? All right, look, look. Well, I'm gonna tell you right now. Me not getting on nobody plane to come to California and die in someone earthquake. Would you stop? I'm coming to Jamaica. Where you staying? With you, of course, in my old room. Come on, won't that be fun? Me not so sure. Just think, you can invite some of your old friends, like Tuffy. She died. Oh, sorry. Okay, our cousins then, and what about onion and Froggy, right? They moved to Canada almost a decade ago, but you know what? I could invite some of my church family, and there's other people in... That would be perfect. As long as you keep it small, you know, that would be fine, because you know, Corrine, I'll tell you. If there's one thing I've learned since Frank's death and the pandemic is that you gotta make time for your loved ones, you know? Because you just never know when the good Lord is gonna bring you home. I'm sorry, when you get save? Let's just say I've been inspired. Please say yes. All right, all right, all right, but I must have the party in my yard. All right? And no alcohol, oh, and there must be plenty good music and dancing and singing, and you know what? You can have a little, tiny bit of alcohol. Okay, yeah, okay. Okay, sounds like a plan. I will see you soon, Sis. Okay, Sis. See you soon. Bye. Bye. God, help me. God, help me, cheese on rice. Hey, Mom, I need to head to the clinic for my next client. What's the emergency? Well, nothing. I was just thinking about the conversation that you and Marsha had about traveling and. Mmhmm, Aunty Corrine already called me. When were you gonna tell me? Oh, well, you know, it was so spur of the moment. I almost forgot it was her 50th myself, but I'll be back in like four or five days. Seems ambitious a week away from Christmas, and I wish I could go, but I can't drop everything during the busiest time of the year so. No, no, no, I totally understand. That's why I didn't even bother calling you. Well, I'm glad that that you two are finally speaking again after all these years, and I think it's really sweet that you're doing this for her. I can't think of a better Christmas or a birthday gift than you being with your sister. Yeah. Well, Mom, I hate to rush you, but I really need to head to the office. So just make sure you call me as soon as you land and have tons of fun and take lots of pictures, okay? I will, and I love you. I love you, I love you. I love you too, Ma, bye. Ah, I'm going to Jamaica! Lorna, this is Gloria. My mom is heading to Jamaica for a quick trip to visit family. Whatever you do, don't freeze her plastic. If you have any questions, give me a call, thanks. Can you say win, can you say win big at black Jack, what? Jamaica, yes, baby, yes! Ah, Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Oh, that's gorgeous. I'll bring that bag. An original back there? Everything here is original, Ma'am. Well, this is nice quality things here. Yep. I might come back and do a little shopping myself at some point. Of course. Okay, I will be back for these in seven days. Gorgeous, right? Pearls. Since you want a quick loan, I can cut you a deal. - Okay. - 8,000. What? Oh, sir, these are Japanese akoya pearls with, look at that. There are two carrots worth of diamonds on the clasp alone. Ma'am, I don't have time to argue. Fine, I'll take 10. The offer is eight, which is generous. Really? Okay. I'll get the paperwork ready? I'll need your ID. Sure. Dolores, over here! Dolores, come now, come, come! Really, she parked a country mile away. She couldn't get any closer like everybody else? I'm already sweating out of my ears. Starting already. Hey, Corrine. Hey, other side. Was just gonna give you a hug. It's Covid. - Yeah, okay. - Oh, no, no, come, meet me in the back. What is the problem? All right. All right, let's do this. - So. - We can, okay. I got it. How was your flight? Safe, okay. You wear your mask? Yeah. Okay, good, hands. Give me your hands. Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go. - All right. - Okay. Sit in the back. What? Get in the back. Come now. Oh, come. I have been vaccinated, you know? So what? Huh? What? Nothing, is the AC on? No it's broken. So just go ahead and buckle up. Corrine, it's all this plastic and this mask. I can barely breathe back here much. Dolores, Dolores, why you whine so much now? - It's hot. - Fine, fine. We can both take off our mask once we get to the house, okay? Just drive, girl, drive. - Buckle up. - I feel like I'm in a coffin. You whine like a. ♪ Don't care what they say Okay, here we are. All righty then. Come on in. Come on in, and welcome home. Oh, okay, just as I remember it. Now, why would I change perfection? Because it's the 21st century. Oh, do you want some sorrel? - Yes, please. - That's right. It's nice. Nothing different. Look at us. Look at mommy. Okay. Here we go. Thank you. You know, I have this exact same picture and look at us how we. Yeah, yeah, it's nice. It's nice, it's nice. I forgot how good this is, girl, girl, and I forgot how humid it gets here, because I am absolutely drenched. Do you hear me? Green arm? I just need a shower. Okay, but do you forget where your room is? Not if you haven't changed anything. Well, there are fresh sheets on the bed and towels are in the cupboard, and remember, we have a water tank. So short showers, please. Right. And once you get settled, I would really like to go over the guest list and the menu, you know. Okay, but I'm... Because sometimes, you know, Americans, you tend to casualize certain events, but we, Jamaicans, we regard them with a deep, deep respect, and we don't want my 50th birthday party to come some kind of lackadaisical indulgence. Of course not. Just one more thing. You know, sometimes, you tend to get a little happy and forget yourself. I recall that being the other way around. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's fair, but I haven't had a drop in a long, long while. Oh, okay. So if you don't mind, I just need you to behave yourself. All right? Because me don't want to suffer any embarrassment. Yes, you don't have to worry, Sister. I promise. Listen, this is going to be unforgettable. Oh, thank you. I'm so happy, I'm excited. All right, all right, go on. Shower, shower, shower. Yes, shower, please. All right. Perfect, just perfect. God, please help me get through this, and I promise I will never, ever gamble again. This is the last time, I swear. I swear. Thank God there's a breeze out here. Ooh, I thought I was gonna suffocate in my room. Plenty hotels in town, you know? I'm not complaining, Corrine. I'm just saying, my menopause. What about you? It's best not to fight it. Yeah, I believe that God wants women to sweat out the sorrow. Oh, look, look, look, a yellow-billed hummingbird. You know, as a matter of fact, this morning... Do you have a landscaper? For what? I wanna have your grass cut so it can be nice for your cozy, little party. Yeah, about that. It's a little difficult keeping the party cozy, you know, once the word get out. Okay, so how many people are we expecting? Well, about 20 or 30, and then there's a cousins coming in from the country, and of course, there's Aunt Gracie and Uncle Phillip and... They're still alive? Well, you would know that if you kept in touch. Remember when you and mommy left for the states? Yes, it was Aunty and Uncle who helped raise me alongside Granny, God rest her soul. Yeah, I remember. A split tail hummingbird. That means good luck, you know. I'm gonna need it to pull off the best birthday party ever. Okay. Okay, so, let's talk color schemes. What are you thinking? Well, I really like pink. Oh, okay, pink it is, yes. Okay. Dolores, I know I don't show it, but I really am so happy that you're here. I mean, I can't believe that you came all this way just for me. Anyway, enough of that. - Yes, enough of that. - I better go and start getting ready. Okay, for what? For church, we leave at eight o'clock sharp, and so if you need anything pressed, the iron is in the closet. Oh, you know, I plan to sleep in. Excuse me, what? But you know what? Who can't use a little more church, right? Exactly, especially this time of year in anticipation of the birth of our sweet baby Jesus. Ha, Amen. Amen, but can I get a key? For what? Well, I need to run some errands for the party and. Oh, yes, yes, of course. Here, come, you can use this one, but you must remember to bring it back, okay? Me don't want my key laying around someplace in California. Like anybody's gonna break in here. Is what's that? So happy to be back in here. I'm happy to be back here. Yes, I'm happy you're here too, Yes, yes. Very happy, very happy. All right, don't stay up too late now. Yes. ♪ On your knees ♪ Oh, hear the angel voices ♪ Oh, night divine Yes, father. ♪ Oh, night when Christ was born ♪ Thank you, Jesus. ♪ Oh night divine ♪ Oh night divine - Yes, hallelujah. - Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.

Oh, of course, I am excited. I just wanna make sure you receive my wire. Great, thank you, yes, and happy... Ruby Bradley, remember me? Hi, of course. I'm just ordering some flowers for Corrine's birthday party. And we're so excited. Sandra Stewart, our mothers worked together back in the day at Boston Monte Hospital. That was a long time ago, wow. Yeah. So wasn't that a wonderful service? Absolutely, Pastor Price always delivers a memorable holiday message. Yes, well, it was good seeing you both. You know, I'll see you both at the party. I need to get back to these arrangements. We were so excited when Corrine told us you were coming back home to plan this big birthday bash for her. Yeah, well, originally we were planning to have a little party here for her at the sanctuary. We can still do a little something for her. Nonsense, Corrine's big sister come all the way from California. We wouldn't dare take away that privilege from you. How long are you staying? Oh, I leave Friday. Ah, quick trip. Well, I gotta get back for Christmas. Oh, to Gloria and Marsha. Yeah, how do you know them? Yeah, Corrine speak about them nonstop. Of course. I'm doing the Mannish water. The what? You forget? Goat head soup. So ladies, here's the thing. I haven't solidified the menu yet, but I'm thinking that sounds... Absolutely delicious. I see you met my besties, Sandy and Ruby, right? Oh, oh, look, look, look, excuse me, excuse me. Pastor gave me this lovely reed for Aunt Gracie and for my birthday, he is donating the tables and chairs for the party. Oh, well, now that is wonderful, - Yes. - But now let's talk about the menu, because I'm think finger foods, and we just keep it light. Girl, you got jokes. British gone a long time. Jamaicans come to a party to eat with knife and fork, not starve to death, especially at Christmas time. Wait, now I thought this was my party. - It is. - Okay, so let me do the menu. In fact, I show it to you already. We're going to have curry goat and boiled banana and yam, yes. Mouth start watering already. And ox tail and bread fruit. Look, absolutely no finger food. I don't want my friends coming to my party and talking about me behind my back. People can be wicked, you see? Okay, but who is doing all this cooking? We are. Well, most of it. You're getting the rest of it catered, right? Right, right. Okay, and Emily and Aunt Gracie, they're making my birthday cake, yes. Dolores, you can do the decorations. Gladly. By the way, we are going over to Aunt Gracie's and Uncle Phillip's for dinner tonight. What? I wish you would've told me sooner. Well, I thought you would've been happy. When was the last time you saw them? I just thought I would see everybody at your birthday party. Well, call us if you need anything, bye. Yeah. Get ready to deck the halls, Darling. Your friends are lovely. I know. A tragic construction. Oh my gosh. Hey. - Oh. - Okay. Come here. Oh, Dolores. Oh my goodness, you look just the same. Well, you don't. It's been so long, Dolores. Look at you, come, come, come. Why Americans diet so? You look skinny. Well, if you say so. Aunty, I'm sorry I came empty-handed. Well, I didn't. Excuse me. Right, get in. Hello, Aunty. This is a gift for you from Pastor Price. Oh, thank you. Put it on the table. Oh, excellent. Look like a bad storm coming. Oh, not really, just heavy rain. You know how it is. Okay, it's all right. Well, anyway, we're sorry that we're so late. We had made a slight detour. We went to visit mommy and daddy's grave site. Of course. I know. Of course. Aunty, your Christmas tree is beautiful. Well, I try, but Emily does a great job, and speaking of Emily, she's in the kitchen. I don't think you've ever met. So come on. Secondly, kitchen is where you need to go. You need bread fruit and banana. You have to get some banana bread fruit, some corn meal porridge. Oh, yes, of course. You trying to put extra junk in my trunk? You're too skinny, man, come. Ah, here we are. Hey, Corrine. Hi, Sweetheart, something smells good. I want you to meet your cousin, Dolores. Wow, hi, so nice to finally meet you. Welcome home. Thank you, and she is right. It smells great in here. So tell me, what kind of vegetables do we have? I'm a vegetarian. Whatever that means, come. - Oh, Aunty. - Uh-huh. I can't stay tonight. I have plans. I understand. Come, Dolores, your Uncle Phillip can't wait to see you. Phillip, come on, come on, Phillip. You remember Delores? Patricia. Okay, here we go. I'm gonna slide around you right here. So happy holidays, Uncle. All right, night, everyone. Enjoy the dinner. - G'night. - Nice to meet you, Emily. Like you stole your mother's face. See, not fair that one child should get all that beauty. Oh, stop, you're making me blush, and you know, you are quite handsome yourself. Don't tell him that. It'll go to his head, even at 82. Well, you know what they say? The older the moon, the brighter it shine. True that, Uncle, true that. Where is Gloria? It's just me this time, next trip. You girls still fighting over the house? No, Uncle, Corrine lives in Grandma's house, and I live in California. There, isn't always with us. Some days are better than others. You know, Aunty, I miss you in church today. Oh, I had a little ache this morning, but look, God won't mind if I take one day off. I've taken several. Candles are beautiful, Aunty. Nice touch. Almost forgotten that. Now Marsha is growing like a weed. And Gloria's a spitting image of your mother. Why my sister not here? Phillip, Patricia died a long time ago. Oh, okay. Let us bless the food before it get cool. No, uncle, we already... Dear Lord, thank you for bringing us together as a family, by your merciful grace, for the nourishment of our bodies. Bless my sweet wife, Gracie, my nieces, Emily. What you name again? It's Corrine, Uncle. No, the pretty one. Phillip, God bless Corrine and Dolores, Amen. Please pass the color loaf for me. Certainly, Uncle, here you go. You know, Dolores, I thought you'd have been wearing the pearls? I didn't wanna fly with them, Aunty. I understand. That was a precious gift that wealthy Japanese woman gave your mother. Yeah, well, mommy took good care of that lady. You know, it's still a mystery to me how Mommy managed to stash those pearls away into a safe deposit box that nobody knew about. Maybe she should know their worth. Do you? Now, Corrine, like I've said before, if I, if we decide to sell mommy's pearls, you will get your half. Why don't you let me buy a birthday cake from the bakery and save everybody the trouble? Nonsense, I have everything I need to make Corrine's birthday cake, and that's that? Thank you. Yes, Ma'am. What was the word in church? Oh, Pastor was talking about the importance of forgiveness and not holding grudges, and then he asked both myself and Dolores to stand up and be acknowledged by the congregation. For what? For her coming all this way for my birthday. Well, that was nice. Yes, oh, and then he also, of course, mentioned the both of you, in fact, the entire family. It was very nice. Would you please pass the rolls, Dolores? Thank you. You're welcome. I can feel this one. This is it. This is gonna be like the big win. I'm so glad. All right, come on, girl. Okay, that's a good start. All right. Come in. Dolores, good morning. Oh, I see your up early. Well, I'm leaving for work, and I'll be back for lunch. You need anything? No, but why didn't you tell me about Uncle Phillip? I mean, he is my uncle too. You mean the one you ain't even know was alive? Really? I'm sorry. You know what? Let's not start today on a sour note, okay? I am doing my best to get reacquainted with you, because you realize it's been a while since we spent any time together. I know I'm set in my ways, but please know that I am trying, and you know, I realize that you're trying too. Otherwise, why else would you have come this way, right? Right. All right, later. Okay, later. Okay, what other reason? Are you kidding me? Ooh, this is gonna be good. I feel it. I feel it. Can't get there fast enough. What the hell? Excuse me, excuse me. Excuse me, excuse me! Do you know what time it is? Dolores, long, long time. It's me, Trooper. Corrine told me to get the yard ready for the party later. Right, but do you have to do it right now? Yeah, me want to beat the rain, you know? Gonna want to come make a strong appearance. Plus, everybody been keeping parties in the yard since the pandemic. So me busy, but you look good, though. Yeah, you too, but can't you come back later, like tonight? No? Okay. Dolores, Dolores! It is noon. Is why you're still in bed sleep? I have splitting headache from all that salt in Aunty's food, and your gardener decided to do the lawn at the crack of dawn. Which you asked for for my party, and in case you hadn't notice, I do not have a maid. So I would appreciate coming home and finding my house the same way as when I left it. Okay, okay, I'm going to clean up. You can't down upon bucket and draw water, you know? What? I said, you cannot sit down upon a bucket and draw water. It's a shame you don't even remember your own first tongue. Look, you know, Granny, she left his house to me, all right? And I plan on keeping it right. You're not gonna come up in here and invite rat and roach to eat out all the wood up from under me. Okay, would you stop? And for the record, Grandma left this house to both of us. Which you wanted no part of. You call it a shack, from what I recall. So much for us trying to get along, huh? And don't chip my dishes. I am not a child. ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open slay ♪ Yeah, very good, Marsha, and these cookies are delicious. You did such a good job. You have the key to grandma's house, Right? Mmhmm. I was thinking maybe we could put up some decorations before she got back? Oh, sweetheart, that's a beautiful idea, but I don't... But what? Baby, can you answer that for me? Okay, Mommy. Thank you. Hey, Gran, how's Jamaica? It's wonderful. What you up to? Nothing much, wrapping presents with mommy, and we just baked some coconut cookies using your recipe. Well, that sounds amazing. Well, now would you be a sweetheart and put mommy on the phone? Okay, Gran. Here you go, Mommy. Thank you, babe. Hey, Ma, how's it going down there? Well, your militant Aunty is driving me nuts with all of her Nazi rules. She just has her old routine like you used to. What? Mmhmm, wait, hold on one second. Somebody's calling me. Hey, Aunty. Hello, Gloria darling, yes, it's Aunty Corrine. I am so sorry to trouble you, but your mother, oh, she is grinding on my last nerve, and I'm getting so sick and tired of tip-toeing around my house on eggshells trying to pacify her own jealousy of our relationship. I know, I know. I don't know why she's so jealous of our relationship. That's what makes your mother's visit so puzzling to me? Well, maybe the holidays inspired her to mend the fence after all these years? No, no, no. Something's not right. I can just feel it, you know? Yeah, she hasn't been herself lately. You right about that. She been sleeping all hours of the day staying in her room playing Solitaire with dirty dishes just pile up in my sink running up my blood pressure and my water bill. I have to constantly remind myself to forgive things that seem unforgivable. Yes, yes, like your ex-husband running off with the secretary. Well, I still need more prayer on that one. All I know is Mommy means well, and she wants your birthday party to be special tomorrow. Huh, ya, man, you know, she barely lift her finger for that? Aunty, I hate to rush you, but mommy's still holding. So I need to get back to her. I love you. I love you too, baby. Bye-bye. Sorry, Ma, I didn't mean to keep you on hold that long, Ma. Yes, yes, I'm here, longest hold ever. I started to hang up. Ma, I'm sorry. Okay, so what were you saying? Do you know what? I have held you long enough, so I'll let you get back to wrapping, okay? Love you. Not dance or care about birthday at Christmas time. All right, wait, I haven't danced like that in years. Oh, Trooper, would you be a sweety, please, and fetch me a glass of fruit punch with just a splash of gingerbeer? No problem, honeybunch. I'll soon come back. All right, thank you. So nice, why don't you just marry him and put him out of his misery? At your age, I don't see many options. Beggars can't be choosers. Okay, all right, Uncle, while I appreciate your wisdom, me not begging, all right, and me doing plenty fine by myself. Personally, I am waiting for a man that is my equal, not a man-baby. This is sweet, you know. Come, wait. One more dance, okay? Come. Yeah, my pleasure. You all right? You okay, Sis? Yeah, just feeling a little woozy. Woozy? Old age already setting in. Snab the man now. Phillip, it must be the heat. Dizzy from all that twirling, right? Yes, and now isn't everybody having a good time? Isn't it crazy how fast time flies when you're having fun though, right? I would like to say something. Okay, Uncle. Happy holidays to everyone. Happy holidays. And to whoever make that Mannish water, very tasty. Yes. What a joyous occasion this is for my niece, Corrine. Oh yes. Who having To endure, man.

It's on me, Miss, early Christmas present. You need help getting over the gate? No, no, no thanks. Okay. Sure you don't need help? Is why you coming back here? You scared me. Let's talk later. I'm tired. You should be tired after all that dog hot and scheming but no, but we gonna talk right now. Is where you went last night? I went to have some fun. Is that a crime? Then why you deceive me, huh? I trusted you. What are you talking about? You know what? It doesn't even matter. It doesn't matter how much a pig tried to hide under sheep wool, because his grunt gonna always betray him. All right, if you must know, I went up town to the play cards. Right, which is the real reason you come back home, right? Okay, now you... No, no, and you just use me for a place to stay. How could you do that? - Okay, now you're - How could you? Just tripping. You are tripping. No, me not tripping! No, you are the one who is tripping! You are the one who's not playing with a full deck! You know, the rich, ooh, the rich shall fall into temptation and a snare with strong women and destruction, when... Oh, would you stop with all the Bible beaten, Corrine? Don't you ever get tired of wearing that nearer-to-God-than-thee brick. You know what? Mommy, she made such a big mistake taking you to the states before me. Okay, you need to let that go. No, no, because you think you're so much better than me? Well, you're not! I waited for years for Mommy to send for me, but she died, right? And I lost my chance. No, you lost your chance, because you got pregnant, and there was no way Mommy was in it for you after that? But you know it was not my fault! Really? You know better than to walk through those gulleys at night. Okay, besides all that, Mommy could barely make rent trying to feed me, cleaning hotels, but you know what she did do? She managed to send a Western Union home every week to help take care of you and Gloria. I watched her work herself to death, and when she died, I thought I would die too, but instead, I chose to drop outta school, pick up where she left off cleaning toilets for you. That's enough! No, no, you wanna had a conversation now once and for all. Let's have it now! No, we're gonna have this conversation, but you keep trying to change the subject! No, you're not listening! I wasn't married, nor a mother, but I loved Gloria a thousand times over as if I gave birth to her myself, and when Grandma told me to take her, there was my faith that carried us, and I never looked back. Your faith? George, your faith. You must be given joke right now, because that attack, he nearly killed me, and my depression. Dolores, I was so young, and it was just to much. You are so selfish! - What the hell! - My Frank, - Oh, Frank! - My Frank adopted her. He never asked any questions, and he never knew the truth, and neither will Gloria unless you unlock that secret, because I plan to take it to the grave like I promised. You know, I can't believe you would bring up such a painful in my past. - This is you... - Bring it up! It's just like you to do that, but I'm telling you. None of that, none of that at all, has anything to do with why I woke up vomiting last night! - What? - Yeah, you heard me! I had to drive myself to the emergency room. The doctor, him tell me I'm dealing something, some allergic reaction to a thing called Zopidem. What, I never heard of that. Yeah, no, but you heard of Ambien, right? Oh, Corrine, I'm sorry. - No, you don't sissy me. - I'm so sorry. - No, I don't want to hear it! - I didn't mean to... Me don't want to hear your foolishness with everything you got boiling up in that brain of yours! You're gonna save it! Dolores, you are sick! Don't touch me! No, no, no, Don't touch me, you are sick! - I need you to hear me. - And you need help. Release me now. Release me now. Okay, no, no, no, please. - You need help. - I need you. I'm sorry. You need help, - I'm sorry! - And plenty of it! - I'm so sorry, please. - Don't touch me. Oh, father, me, father, me, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - You're testing my faith - please, please. Right now. Dolores, I will always be grateful to you for taking in my Gloria, but in the name of God, Jesus as my father, me don't know how I'm ever gonna forgive you for this betrayal. You poison me? Oh Jesus, Jesus. Sissy, no. You poison me! You poison me to go and gamble? Oh, I'm sorry. - No, you know what? - I'm sorry. I want you out of my house! - I'm sorry, please. - Get out of my house! Get out! Get off of my house. Corrine, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Looks like I forgot to clean the kitchen before I left. Yeah, it smells like it, Ma. Okay, I'm on it. This isn't like you. I got it. Ma, you know you slept the whole ride back from the airport. Did I? You know, I could've taken an Uber. You didn't have to pick me up. I had the time. Marsha's at piano practice. You still haven't told me why you came back early. Yeah, I'll tell you later. You didn't even notice the wreath Marsha and I put on your door. Oh, honey, I'm sorry. That was thoughtful. It was beautiful, thank you. Okay, so I wanna hear all about Aunty Corrine's birthday party. I saw the pictures on Instagram, and they made me so jealous. So you haven't heard? Heard what? Aunty Corrine called, but she didn't leave a message. What happened? I'm sure you'll find out soon enough. You two seem to keep in touch. Yes, I stay in touch with my Aunty, who I love. Is that a problem? Just don't think I'll ever see my sister again. Mommy, stop being so dramatic. I'm sure whatever happened, it wasn't that bad. It was that bad, all right. Is that why she's been blowing up my phone? Ma. Gloria, I don't wanna talk about it, okay? Could you just leave it alone. Ma, seriously. Gloria, I'm asking you to leave it alone. - Ma, I'm just... - Gloria, stop it! I don't want to talk about it! Leave it alone! Ma, why are you acting so weird? I asked you to let it go. Leave it alone. Mom, just tell me! Gloria. - Please, just tell me. - Let it go! Fine. - Hello. - Hi, Aunty Corrine. I'm sorry, I'm just getting back to you. Can you please tell me what happened with Mommy, everything? Pawn shop? Well, my husband passed two years ago. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm divorced. Any kids? Yeah, one son. He lives in Maine with his wife and one grand, Ella. Nice. You? Yeah, a daughter, Gloria, and a 12-year-old granddaughter, Marsha, but wait, did you say Maine? Yeah, my son's a marine biologist, and he loves the cold. He didn't get that from me. May I call you Dolores? Yeah, sure. Would you like to get a bite to eat, Dolores? No, I don't know. That sounds like a possible yes. Oh, did the sun just get brighter or did you smile at me? Okay, okay. - You smiled at me. - Dinner it is. You smiled at me. Do you do dinner? Okay, but aren't you out here to get your workout on Mr. Naughty? Uh-huh, intuitive too. I'm gonna pick you up at six. That's good for you? I'll be ready. Okay, watch how fast I am, now. You ready? Oh, naughty or nice. Okay, Mr. Graham. My first attempt was online. We exchanged a few texts, and then we decided to meet. Not here, I hope. Give a brother some credit. Anyway, she's speed dating. Her next victim was at the same restaurant. No, okay, now that is absolutely horrible. See, this is why I won't do online dating. Maybe you won't have to. Why don't you tell me a little bit more about your sister from Jamaica? Did I say something wrong? No, it's just that things have been tense between us for a long, long time. Sibling rivalry? Kind of, but worse than that. You know, I came over to America, she was left behind in Jamaica, and it's complicated. Immigration is always complicated. Just look at the news. Yeah, no, life is complicated, and you know, it's not to say that mine was better. In fact, in many ways, it was harder, because I was away from everything and everyone I loved and listen, it was tough navigating in America alone, poor. You know, I guess it wasn't my pride that kept me from writing home for help, but then I met my husband, Frank, right? Everything changed for me, but my sister doesn't see it that way. Well, how could she if you don't tell her your whole story? Okay, well, that would be where my pride comes back, because you know, we've been on this love-hate cycle for so long that it's just, kind of, the way it is, you know? We just even talk about it, well, until recently, and didn't go very well, and I was the reason why. You wanna talk about it? Look at me telling you all my personal business, and I don't even know you. You know they say sometimes, it's easier to talk to strangers. If you knew what I did, you wouldn't be sitting here with me right now. Nah, I'm hard to shock or shake. Yeah, but do you mind if we just change the subject? Sure, you wanna know what my granddaughter wants for Christmas? Yeah. Me to move to Maine. Oh. We love to go fishing together. That's sweet. Yeah, I'm giving her my old three piece fly rod. Yeah, I wanna surprise her. I'm gonna engrave it with her name. Aww. Mmhmm, and my son, he's always wanted my vinyl collection. I'm just really excited to give them these particular gifts. I just think that is absolutely beautiful that you're giving gifts that they actually want, Yeah. Because I'm ashamed to say, I haven't even thought about buying Christmas presents for anyone. Well, let's go shopping tomorrow, and I can also help you put up those Christmas lights. Hmm, maybe, I don't know. Well, the offer stands if you change your mind. Thank you, Graham. I have had a really good time tonight. Glad we get to do it again soon. Yeah. Have you started going to the meetings? Now, see, all of this policing isn't helping any. Believe me, I want things to go back to the way they used to be, but if you don't stay out of casinos, including online betting, the bank restrictions stay, and do I need to include scratchers too, Ma? Listen, I told you. I am not gonna go share my personal business with a bunch of strangers, and that's final. Fine, suit yourself. Okay, are we done here? Because I'm gonna go ahead and take my walk and then go try to buy some groceries on my new allowance. Mommy, I'm just trying to help you. Please think about the meetings. Mmhmm, thinking. I love you. Can you believe that they were spying on me? Okay, how about we do something different, okay? After all, it is the holidays, although you just can't tell nothing by sitting up in your house, Girl. Dolores, how old are those bananas? Okay, not you too. Get off of my bananas. What you got in mind? You wanna do like some kind of a casino cruise? Oh no, let's do something for us, like a day-spa, mani-pedis, massage. Hmm, maybe, but I'm thinking if I can just get to that casino one more time before Christmas, I'm sure I would hit, and you know how I can feel it. Gloria, stop, stop! Dolores, I go to the casino to have fun. - Yeah. - That's it, no habit, and of late, I have not been having any kind of fun going with you. What? How long have we known each other? Long time, right? Forever, yes. Good friends, okay, so I'm gonna be real. Since Frank died, you have changed. Do you realize if I can't go to the casino with you, you ghost me. Well, now that is not true. Oh, yes, it is true. You don't call. You don't ask how I'm doing. You don't ask about the family or nothing, and then when I can go with you, you sit at that table as if in a trance. You gamble. You have to gamble. Whether you're up or down, whether you're winning or losing, you have to gamble, and Dolores, I'm afraid. I'm afraid that you will do anything to win regardless of the consequences. I cannot continue to enable you. You need help, baby. You need help, and when you get that help, I want you to call me. Call me, and I will be there, Sis. I will be right there. I love you. I love you. Oh, oh, I love you, honey. Get some decorations in here. It's Christmas time. Do something to make yourself happy. Cheer yourself up. Mmhmm. - Okay? - Mmhmm. Okay. Good afternoon. Oh, good to see you again. What do you got? Well, take a look at that. Beautiful time piece, huh? Beautiful, right? Mmhmm, sounds good, looks good, yeah. - Nice piece. - Yeah. Six grand. Six grand, what? Crystal is scratched, your spring's overwound. Rolex's aren't cheap to repair, you know? Okay, but that is worth at least $15,000. Ma'am, with all due respect, you came to me looking for a loan. I'm in business to make a profit, and after you leave, I'm closing the shop for Christmas. Okay, fine, I just thought you'd be reasonable, let me get back my pearls, and make a little profit for myself. Those pearls were sold. Wait, what? I told you I'd be back for them. In seven days. Listen, I have to get those pearls back. They were my mothers. Who did you sell them to? That's not how my business works, Ma'am. Yeah, no, everybody's got a price, okay? So can you just contact the buyer and tell them I will pay double. While you stand there trying to sell me a watch, really? Look, I would like to close up early and get home to my family. Okay, I understand that. We can work this out, though. We have to work this out. But I've already sold it. These were my mothers. It was an heirloom. It was a family heirloom, please. Ma'am, you should leave now. I am getting my mother's pearls back. I can't, why would he sell them? I told him I would be back. This is interesting kind of casino cruise. Cruise which gamble 24-7. Are you a compulsive gambler? Is gambling disrupting your life? Take this short test and find out. All right. Sold things for cash to gamble? Gamble until your money is gone? Engage in desperate or illegal acts? If you answered yes to these questions, find a gambler's anonymous meeting near you. But you guys are doing great. You should be proud of yourselves. Pat yourself on the back. You guys are wonderful, and now it's time for our speaker. - Hey, everyone. - Hello. It's always great to be at a meeting. My name is Graham, and I am a compulsive gambler. This is always a happy time for everyone, but the holidays can also trigger us. You don't have to let it. Help is a phone call away. Even after 11 years, I have to be vigilant. I come from a good family, two hard working parents. I'm the first to graduate college, got married, had a son who, because of this program, still speaks to me today. I would tell his mother I was going to work, but I'd go to the casino. I played to chase the high, and I lost everything. I gambled away my home, my marriage, and losing my family, that shook me to my core, but it was a wake up call. You know, at first, I was reluctant to ask for help, but I realized if I didn't change, I would lose my son forever. It's never too late to turn it around. Thanks for letting me share. Happy holidays. Thank you, Graham. That was on point. If you new, I hope you'll stay, and not to embarrass you, but to get to know you, would you like to share your name, Ma'am in the back? Okay, well, we have plenty of literature up front and Christmas cookies. So help yourself, and if you have attendance cards I need to sign, put them in my sleigh, and don't forget. We have one more meeting before Christmas. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Fancy meeting you here. Yeah, we have a lot to talk about. What do you say we have a meeting after the meeting? You know, after I got over the shock of seeing you at the meeting, your testimony, it made me realize how blind I'd been, how selfish, because my daughter has really just been trying to help me, and all I've done is push her away. You're lucky to have her. You know, we think people can't see through us, but they do. Yeah, I guess I'm just not ready to admit that I am a compulsive gambler like you. You know what I mean. Look, people don't have to hit rock bottom to realize that denial is the real enemy. You believe in God? Yeah, of course. Why? So you believe in a power greater than yourself. Tonight, we prayed about the courage to change the things we can, right? Right. And you told me you had the courage to take that online test. Mmhmm. What were the results? Hey, it's okay. You're too beautiful a person to quit before the miracle. What miracle? You told me you believed in God. I do. Well, this year, my brother invited me to his New Year's Eve party. That's wonderful, right? He hasn't spoken to me in many years. So if you don't have plans, would you like to be my date? I would love to, actually, yeah. That's good. Corrine? Hello, Dolores, is what's happening? Who die? No one died, Corrine. Please don't hang up. I know it's late, but there's something I gotta tell you, and it can't wait. Fine, I'm listening. So I realize that I have a problem and that I hurt you. All right, go on. And I'm so sorry. I'm also ashamed to admit that you were right. I had one thing on my mind when I came to Jamaica. Look, it's no secret that you have a sickness, okay? Yeah, well, there's something else. I made a devil's bargain. Hello, Dolores? Mommy's pearls, the one heirloom she left us, they're gone. Hello? Yes, yes, Dolores, I'm still here. Look, this phone, it keeps cutting out. Look, I heard you say you have made a devil's bargain when you're poisoning me to go and gamble. All right, so why you must call me in the dead of night to rehash some bad news? Look, the only saving grace about all of this is that mommy is not alive to know this sorrow. So you're lucky I'm such a forgiven person, but I'm gonna tell you right now, I must get up early in the morning. So I am going back to sleep, all right? So just good night, good night. Are my girls. Grandma! Hi, hi, my babies. - Hi. - Hi, Marsha. Hi, Gloria. Get up here. Come on, come on, come on. Come here, munchkin, Grandma, you put up the lights and give your grandma a hug. And a Christmas tree. How's my big girl? I knew you would do it. They're beautiful. - Hi, baby. - Are you okay? You look a little tired. Well, I didn't sleep that well. I had a lot on my mind, but I'm fine. I'm good, I'm good. Okay, well, we just came by to drop off these presents. Thank you. Here you go. Thank you. You're welcome. Hi, I'm Gloria, Dolores's daughter. And I'm her granddaughter, Marsha. Hi, you must be so excited about Christmas. It's so nice to meet both of you. I'm Graham Wilkes, and I've heard so much about you. Good things, I hope. Oh yeah. Are you my grandma's helper? Sort of, I'm your grandmother's new neighbor. Wait, is your house the one with all the candy canes in front of it? Yes, I'm the one with the spirit on the block. Graham offered to put these Christmas lights up for us. Isn't that nice? Yep, thank you, Mr. Wilkes. I thought grandma would never get around to it. - Marsha. - Okay, Marsha. I can't wait to turn the lights on. Me too, princess, and how about we do that together? - Okay. - Okay. Ma, can we talk for a sec? Sure, oh, Marsha, sweetpea, would you help Mr. Wilkes untangle the rest of those lights for me, please? Come on, Mr. Wilkes. You good? Yeah, all right, I'm gonna follow your lead. What's up? Mom, what was that? What you mean what, girl? Okay, I'm timing you, 10. Ma, you really think it's a good idea having strangers in your house. You barely know this man. Okay, would you stop? Graham's harmless. Well, you might wanna pump your brakes, because you can't be too careful. Okay, now you're starting to sound like me. Now stop with all that, stop, and before you ask, There you go, and I'll hold this piece. I started going to meetings. Mommy, that is so great. Come here. Yes, yeah, it is, and I'm gonna keep going, because I was actually inspired by what I saw and heard. I'm so proud of you. Thank you. Now, how about you go over there and chat with Graham, just a little bit, please, for me, for me, for me? Just try? No problem, see? Okay, I will try to get to know him. Okay, that's all I'm asking. Thank you. Hey, Marsha, grandma needs Santa's helper in the kitchen. It's hard to believe that Christmas day is right around the corner. Yeah, the year flew by. Listen, Graham, I know that I was a little guarded with you earlier. Oh, no, it's okay. I understand. You have no idea what a relief it is to know that my mom has someone to talk to. It's been really hard, and I can't really get into it, but I wish there was a way that I could thank you. Actually, there is something I could use your help with. Okay, tell me, what? Can you keep a secret? Maybe. Dolores's daughter, okay. You're gonna be tough like that, right? Okay, all right, so here it goes. It's beautiful. You did a great job, Grandma. Thank you, princess, beautiful just like you. Come on, everybody. Let's take a picture. Oh, well, now that's a good idea. You got your phone? Yeah, do you mind? Of course not. Okay, smile. There you go. Thanks, Graham. Ooh, I'm gonna post this one. Oh, this is so cute. You too. Okay, no, no, but delete that one, because I look crazy. - Ma. - Yeah, you do. Yes you do. I am so happy right now. Last year, it was with my daddy. I mean, I love my daddy and all, but it was freezing cold in Mammoth. Oh, but I thought you like to ski? I do, and I love the snow, but I hate the cold. Someday, I'll invent a way to ski and stay to warm. I know you will. I love your imagination, Marsha. Mommy says little girls with big dreams grow up to be woman with big jobs like Kamala Harris. That is true. So what are you doing for Christmas, Graham? You know, I'm just hanging around the house. Alone? Yeah, my son is taking his family and visiting his mother this year on the holidays. You know, sometimes divorce is hard on the parents too, Marsha. Ooh, I know. You should have Christmas dinner with us, right, Grams? Absolutely, yes. Jesus, please take the wheel. Mr. Wilkes shouldn't be all alone on Christmas day all by himself living right next door. That's not right. That's like saying there's no room at the inn, like baby Jesus. Plus, we always have plenty of food. Isn't Christmas about sharing? Yes, baby, it is. Mr. Wilkes, would you like to come to our always delicious jamerican Christmas dinner? I would be delighted, Marsha. Great. All right, well, I hate to break all of this up, but I still have errands to run. All right, so come on, my little blizzard. What's the rush? Christmas, I still got things to do. Okay, bye, boo-boo. I love you. Love you, Mom. Bye, Grandma. Bye Mr. Wilkes. Bye. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you. She's wonderful. Mmhmm, I know. Wonderful. I swear that little girl leaves magic wherever she goes, okay? I know where she gets that from. We should go now. We'll have time to catch that last meeting. Okay, let me get changed. Okay, me too. I'll meet you out front. Hi, my name is Dolores, and I am a compulsive gambler. I came here from Jamaica with my mother when I was a little girl and there was no room for mistakes or getting in trouble, and then I found love, and my husband, Frank, and I lived a really good life together, and then he died, and I was sad and lonely. So I turned to the casino for a false sense of family, I guess. I mean, at first it was just recreational. I've done some terrible things recently that I'm really ashamed of, and I don't wanna lose what's left on my family. They're all I have and all that matters. Thank you, and thanks for being here on Christmas Eve. One day at a time, give it up for our girl, Dolores. Let's close up this meeting. It's Christmas. I will get the glasses. I still can't believe how I was shaking and how you fell out of the sky into my life in a time when I needed a friend the most. Well, I'd like to be more than that if you let me. You sure we're not going to fast? I can go any speed you want me to. I've learned that waiting is an action. Yeah, it is. So why don't you wait for me in the living room, and I'll be in there in a minute. Go on, go, go, go, yep. Sounds like a plan. Yeah. Okay, here we go. Graham... Merry Christmas! You nearly gave me a heart attack. Oh my goodness. Look, Grandma! I see it, sweetie. How did you manage to pull all this off? All that matters is that we did, Ma. Is that right? They did all the decorating. I just got the tree. I am so thankful and blessed. Is how much longer I must hide? Corrine? Oh my God. I told you I had to get up very early when you call, right? I'm so sorry. It's all right. You know, at the end of the day, I only have one sister. Me too. I'm so happy to see you. Ooh, Ma, that smells so good. So can I get a taste. Ah, you wait like everybody else. Fine, mom. I can only imagine all the plotting and planning you had to do to pull this off, missy. Well, so just how serious are you and this Graham? Nevermind all that. We're just friends. Hand me the pepper. He seems like a keeper. He is rather wonderful. And you deserve it, Mom. I was so busy with Marsha and work that I didn't realize how lonely you were. No, honey, listen, it's okay, okay? You are such a blessing. To have a mother like you. I mean, that too. Oh, and before I forget, I believe these belong to you. Did you just pull that out your black mama's purse? Yes, like mother, like daughter. Oh, okay. All I need is a debit card. - Wow. - Yeah, and you know, at the meetings, they've been really pushing us to be honest. So there is something important I need to tell you. Not now, Ma, maybe not ever. Whatever it is, it can wait. Okay. Come here. I wanna show you something. Sit down. What you up to now? I don't know if I can take another surprise. What is this? But don't you wanna open gifts with the rest of the family? Not this one. I want it to be just you and me. Okay, beautiful bow. Thank you. Let's see what we got here. Who are you? I love you. I love you too. God, I love you. Oh, shoot, now you gone messed up my mascara. Look, Mommy, Daddy got me a new laptop. Wow. It's top of the line and better than mine. Well, let's put this away now. - What are you doing? - Your turn. Dolores, what is this? Now, you know we don't exchange presents. That's just for the young. What, nevermind all that. Open it, open, open. All right, all right. Your mother sure bossy, you know. I know. I wrapped it. Had to make you work for it a little bit. Apparently, okay, all right. All right, all right. Dolores, oh, Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. - Breathe. - I can't believe it. Breathe, Sister. And you're giving me Mommy's pearls? Yeah, it's your turn to enjoy them. Oh, oh, thank you. Thank You so much. Dolores, thank you. Come on, come on. Let's put them on. Oh my gosh. Let me help you now. Oh, they're so beautiful? Oh, thank you, Father. Oh, thank you, Father. Okay, stop moving. Oh, Dolores, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Okay. - You know, it's not just about the pearls, you know? It's about Mommy's energy that is in them and your energy too. That's what make them so special to me. I never thought I'd see the day. Oh, my father, but you know what? You messed wrong for sure this time, because me never gonna take 'em off. No, wait, no. Let me see, let me see. Oh, excuse me, baby, excuse me. Go, go, go. Oh boy. Look what you done started, Ma. Oh, they look so good. Oh, want to forget about my two favorite ladies. Yes. Grandma, you remembered. It's the scarf you wear to tea, the one grandpa gave you. Yeah, you like it? I love it. How about that? Yes. Mom, Grandma's cookbook, are you sure? Positive, you've always said you wanted it, and this Christmas is more than just giving gifts. It's about receiving and passing our history forward. Yes, I tell you what, Marsha. You're gonna be eating a lot of ackee and shellfish too hard to brake. Come on, move, move, move. And I'm gonna need a lot of help making it so. I suggest you come and ask me for that, because you know, your mother, she can't cook, you know? Oh, mommy. You know nana can cook, huh, boo? She almost burned down the whole house. Are you serious? - No, no, - Ma. That is not what happened. Wait, wait, hold on. This one says that it's for a Mr. Wilkes from Santa. - For me. - Yeah. Well how does Santa know that I was gonna be here? Oh, cause Santa knows everything, right, boo? We might need a little help though, guys. - All right, we got this side. - There you go. No, oh my God. Oh my Lord. This is one of the best fly rods on the market. How did you know? Well, don't look at me. I said Santa knows everything. Oh, man. I feel a little strange, because I don't have gifts for y'all. Oh, no. Graham giving comes in all kinds of ways, and the gift of you being in our lives is priceless. I prefer cash, though. Girl. You would say that, Aunty. Actually I do have something that I would like to share. Okay, more surprises? I like the sound of that. - Ain't you gonna? - Some of that. Come, sit.
