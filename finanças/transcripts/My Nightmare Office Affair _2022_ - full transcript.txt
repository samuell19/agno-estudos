No, I just got home from court with her. More screaming, more crying, More blaming. She can have the kids. I need my peace. My oldest is, uh, taking it hard. Yeah, course she blames me. Who knows that the hell that woman says about me. (chuckles) yeah. (sighs) Look, I gotta unwind. I--I'll fill you in on all the dirty details At lunch tomorrow, all right? Take care. (clears throat) (coughing) (coughing) (gasping) (sighs, grunts) (woman moans) -You're gonna be late. -I know, just ten more minutes. (jen) well, then I'll be late. (he sighs) (nick) I know. It's a school day. (jen) yeah. (juju) mommy? (nick) saved by the bell. (jen) okay. I'll get her. (grunts) (groans) (giggles) (yawns) All right, let's do this. -'bout time. -It was a struggle. Hi, daddy. Do you want some eggs? It won't take me long if you do. Eh, I have a big day, I should get in there early. This'll be enough. What do you got goin' on today? I am gonna try to hit up a new yoga class Down the street If I can get juju to school on time. -It's been a while. -Way too long. And then, you know, the usual, Groceries, cleaners, pick up juju. I have a bag of shirts ready for the cleaners, If you wouldn't mind bringing them in for me. -Not at all. -All right, I'm off. -Bye, juju-bean. -Bye, daddy. -See you tonight. -Mm. -I love you. -Love you too. (nick) and I love you. All right, julianna, let's finish that up. We gotta get you to school. -Okay. -Okay! -Good morning, sunshine. -Morning, cass. -You ready? -For what? Our team meeting. Oh. If you got your head outta coding And looked at your schedule Every once in a while, you'd know. I know, I know, I lost track of time. Well, you have about five minutes To get yourself together and look a little less, uh, Disheveled. -Thank you for that. -That was harsh. Okay, uh, let's say... Disorganized. -I'll see you in there, okay? -Right. (sighs) there you are. (sighs) (female announcer) conexofi isn't just about convenience. This app automatically adjusts All connected smart devices and appliances To your customized preferences. Giving you total control over the little things So you can focus on the big things. (lisa) well... Commercial certainly looks great. How are we doing on the launch? (bob) on schedule, just a couple more kinks to work out And we got it covered. Right, guys? (clears throat) -No, you should do it. -Nick? (nick) nothing. (lisa) are you sure? Um, well, there is a pretty concerning backdoor That we haven't figured out yet. -And, uh... -Backdoor? (nick) I don't think that we can ethically release conexofi Until we have it solved. What do you mean exactly? You wanna turn your phone on and open up the bluetooth? Okay, now the average user wouldn't be able to do this But an unscrupulous person with some programming knowledge Could potentially hijack any discoverable devices In the area... And do this. (bob sighs) (cass laughs) Okay, well, um... That's not good. (nick) nope, it's not. It's pretty concerning actually. I mean, we've all heard about the cases Where hackers are able to access nursery monitors, right? Well, I've been playing around with this at home And like I said, A determined person could potentially hack Into any device in your home That's connected to the internet. If we release next week without solving this, A tech journalist is gonna find out about it and... We're gonna be dead in the water As soon as the word gets around. (lisa) bob, did you know about this? I was made aware of it recently. Very recently. Okay, so, do we have a timeline On how long this is gonna take to fix? (nick) honestly, no. We've been working on it since last month When I discovered the issue And I submitted a report immediately But...It's still not solved. Very recently, huh? Well, the commercial looks great, But I think that we need a finished product Before we go to market, don't you? (cass) you really made quite the impression back there, buddy. -Yeah, you think so? -Oh yeah. I mean, you also made a mortal enemy. (nick) yeah, well, he hates me already, so. (bob) hey, nick! What's going on, bob? -It's great in there, really. -Thank you. (bob) hey listen, you wanna do me a favor? Give me a little heads-up next time You plan on cutting me off at the knees In front of everyone? Hm? I think it's important we present a united front Rather than you having me lookin' like a jackass. -Agreed? -Yeah, of course. -I'm not trying to make-- -great. Glad you're on board. (nick sighs) -It's not funny. -It's so funny. You really shouldn't have said anything. -You nudged my arm. -Not my fault. I didn't make you say anything at all, I mean... (exhales forcefully) Boo! Oh. Hey. -I'm sorry, did I scare you? -No, no. It's just cassie is usually the one sneaking up on me. (lisa) well, I didn't mean to startle you. I just wanted to pop in here and say thank you For pointing out what could have been a very serious problem. I'm gonna grab a bite to eat. Come with me. Uh...I should stick around And keep on working on a solution for conexofi. We can chat about your future at the company. -Thank you. -Thanks. I want you to know, I've bene noticing All the hard work and extra hours You've been putting in at the office. Yeah, my wife has certainly noticed too. I think that she thought she'd be back to work by now But...You know, between the app build and our daughter, Her ambitions have had to take a back seat. Think she's gettin' a little fed up with me actually. (lisa) well, this is what spouses do, right? They complain and get in the way. Jen's not like that though. She'd never say anything. And she takes great care of julianna. How old is your little girl? She just started the first grade. Oh. I bet she's precious And smart, like her daddy. I think she's a little smarter, frankly. Oh, maybe we should be recruiting her then. I don't know, she's really focused On being a princess right now. Oh. Is everything okay? I just, um... I sometimes wish I had a princess of my own. But...It didn't work out that way. I'm sorry for bringing it up. I didn't mean to talk about my daughter. -Sometimes I just-- -no, don't be. I have spent years focusing on my career And running away from the idea of a family That when I finally looked up And thought about what I wanted, It was too late. Aw, come on, that's not true at all. I bet you would make a great mother. You're sweet. Anyway, I brought you here for a reason. But now I am... I'm a little concerned That your wife might be upset. And what's that? Well, it involves you spending more time away from home. But...How do you feel about leading the team Moving forward? -Leading the team? -And a pay bump, To sweeten the deal. (laughs) But what about bob? Bob let us down today, nick. He needs a change of scenery. And a new department, frankly. And we need somebody that we can trust To get this app launched. You think you can handle it? (sighs) Yeah. Yeah, I can handle that. Good. (nick) I... I don't know what to say. You've been devoted to this company For a long time, nick. You deserve this. Don't think I haven't noticed. Thank you. It's nice to be noticed. Once we get this app launched, We'll see what we can do about getting you A more permanent management position. Just do me a favor, nick, and get this nailed. We don't want anyone second-guessing you. Hey, I'm your man. I know you are. Excuse me, could I get another merlot, please? And, uh, whatever this handsome gentleman would like. We're celebrating. Water is fine for now. Thank you. -Good boy. -Stop. All right then, we should order and get back to work Before people start talking about us. -Hey there. -Oh, hey, cassie. -How are you? -Good. If you're looking for nick, he should be in his office. Yeah, just wanted to see if he wanted to grab an early dinner. Oh, well, if he doesn't take you up on that offer, I sure will. (laughing) -Knock-knock. -Hey! What are you doing here? (jen) I was in the neighborhood And I just wanted to see if you wanted to take me to dinner. (nick) hon, I was just about to call you. I actually have some news to share. (jen) what's up? -I got promoted. -Oh my gosh, that's incredible! Oh, honey! (nick) yeah, and if the launch goes well, I could be moving up to a management position. That's--that's amazing. We--well, we definitely have to celebrate now. -Come on, let's go! -Look, I wish I could But...I really-- I gotta stay late tonight. We're slammed with this launch deadline And there's a glitch in the programming That I'm in charge of fixing, So it's all hands on deck. And it's probably gonna be a regular thing for a while. Okay. Well, I guess that makes sense. (nick) yeah, but it's only while I'm heading up this project. It's a couple weeks at the most And then I'll be able to cut back, set my own hours, And that could give you more time to pursue Whatever you want to. I have ambitions too, nick. I know. I know. I'm just... I'm sorry, I'm just distracted with work. -It's crazy. -It's okay. We'll have plenty of time. Oh, and that event that we were maybe gonna go to tomorrow, We really have to go now. Okay. I'll see if my mom can watch juju. -Yeah? -Mm-hm. (nick) you're the best, babe. -I don't deserve you. -Yeah. Well, text me on your way home? -I will. -Okay. -I love you. -I love you too. (lisa) um, why don't you give that to bob, please? Thank you. -I don't know, it's, um... -Yeah. (lisa) I think we need to look at those... (nick) thanks for doing this, hon. I know it's not how you wanted to spend our Saturday. (jen) well, you're the team leader now. This is really important. I'm so proud of you. (cass) where have you guys been? It has been so boring here. (laughter) -Hi, cassie. -Hi. (lisa) oh, there's nick. Nick! -Hi. -Nick! Come on over. -You've been spotted. -Oh boy. Schmooze mode. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! -Rescue me later? -I will. (lisa) nick, our wonderful new project manager. (nick) hey, this is my wife, jennifer. Jennifer, this is my boss, lisa. -Hi. -I have something for you. Well, for your daughter, really. For loaning us her daddy on all those long weeknights. I was walking out of the mall And I just thought it was so precious, I couldn't resist. -Aww. -Knew she'd love it. -Wow. Thanks, lisa. -That's very kind of you. -Thank you. -This is the man That turned my phone into a disco ball. He's a genius. Anyway, nick, so I'm happy you're here. I wanted to discuss the future of the company with you. (bob) is this seat taken? (jen) I guess not. (bob) so you're married to the, uh, golden boy, huh? Hm. (jen) I guess so. (bob) you know, lisa's really taken a liking to him. A lot of late nights in his future. Phew. Hm. (jen) well, it's the countdown for the launch, so. (bob) hm. Yeah, for the good of the company. Obviously. (jen) what's that supposed to mean? (bob) nice meeting you. Enjoy the party. (lisa) I'm just so happy that you're here. -I really am. -Yeah, me too. (laughing) -Right. Oh. -Oh, hey, hon. Hey, I think it's getting kinda late, We should probably head out. (nick) uh, yeah, I guess we could do that. (jen) yeah, it was nice to meet all of you. (nick) the thing is, I should probably stick around. I mean, this is my team now. (jen) okay, yeah. Um, well, I'll see you at home. (nick) yeah, I'll just order a car. Okay. Okay, it was nice to meet you. (nick) night, hon. -That worked out. -Yeah, so wait, What were you talking about? (lisa) anyway, as we were saying, We're just really happy to, um... (sighs) (jen) finally! -I was starting to get worried. -Sorry, babe. -You're practicing again. -Yeah, just... Trying to get back into a routine. -Nice. -How was the party? (nick) so much schmoozing. -Oh yeah? -Yeah. (jen sighs) Seems like lisa really likes you. What? I'm telling you, she's into you. -Stop! -Nick, I know women. That woman likes you. Well...Even if she is a little into me, I'm not interested. Hey, I'm only interested in one hot yoga teacher. (she laughs) (jen) I'm not a teacher anymore. (she sighs) (scoffs, laughs) Brute force. (callie) I'm sorry, ms. Wolf. This is a lovely home And you're more than able to provide for a child But your work-life balance just isn't conducive To single parenthood. And this juvenile assault charge is a large hurdle to-- (lisa) the girl that did that was a teenager, okay? From a broken, abusive home. That's not who I am now. My father drank himself to death And left us alone. I wanna adopt a child So that I can save them from having to ever go through this. Nobody understands better than me. (callie) I sympathize with you, ms. Wolf, really. But the state generally doesn't approve people Under these circumstances. I'll do my best. But I don't want you to get your hopes up. (lisa) file it. (callie) all right, then. Yes? They had one of those muffins you like in the kitchen today. Thought you might like one. Oh. Thanks, bob. That's thoughtful. You're welcome. Anything else? Now, about this whole restructuring thing-- I already decided. I'm not changing my mind. I just want to see the project finish out. I'm happy to transfer after but you-- Okay. We'll talk about it later. -Tonight? -No, bob. Not tonight. (he sighs) (she sighs) (she sighs) (drawers clattering) (she sighs) (she sighs) (scoffs) You nerd. Oh, thank you. All right, well, I'll see you tomorrow, boss man. Oh, I'd appreciate it if you'd call me mr. Boss man. Of course. (laughing) -Bye. -Bye. (lisa) you know, you don't have to do it all. When you have a team under you, You're supposed to delegate. (nick) I know, I just... I really want the launch to be perfect. And it will be with you in charge. Well, I appreciate that vote of confidence. Did you want an update? We're working on a solution right now-- (lisa) no, that's not necessary. I just, um... I just wanted to let you know how impressive your work is. I can't wait to see what you do in this new role. Impressive? That's, uh...High praise. Well, um, you are. (nick sighs) You know, it's gettin' kinda late, I should probably get home. Yeah. Right. I guess. If that's what you really need to do. I'll see you tomorrow. Whoa. Whoa. -What? -I have a wife. Your wife doesn't have to know. Okay, that's not what I meant. Come on, nick. You can't pretend with me. Look, I'm really flattered, lisa, But I can't. (she laughs) Look, I have to go. (lisa) see you tomorrow, then. (snorts) Hello, baby. (jen) so, should I expect you home for dinner Or are you gonna be late again? I'm gonna be home late a lot going forward, babe. I told you this. Look, I'm sorry, I'm just... I'm under a lot of pressure right now. It's just a short-term thing. What? -Hi, lisa. -Hey there. I, um...Have a doctor's appointment this morning That I had to squeeze in. Would you mind taking the lead on that strategy session That we've got? Yeah, of course. (lisa) great. Thanks. Lisa again, huh? Jen, she's my boss. -I know. -Look, I know that this isn't great for our family life, But I'll make it up to you two girls soon. I swear. (jen) well, we'll be here waiting. (sighs) (chuckles) (jen) come on, juju. Come on, juju, we're gonna be late. (jen) here we go. (indistinct chatter) Yeah? Are you gonna color? -Yep. -Yeah? Okay. Well, have so much fun, honey. -Love you! -Love you, too! Muah! -Bye! -Bye, honey. Hi, guys, what are you doing? Good to see you. You guys have a great day. -Bye. -Bye. -Thank you. -Here you go. -Have a nice day. -Thanks. Oh, I'm so sorry. Lisa? -Jennifer sherman. -Oh! -Nick's wife. -Right, right. -How are you? -I'm good. He really thinks a lot of you, by the way. All that you do for your daughter. Oh, I didn't know he talked about me. What a sweetheart. (lisa) I will say, Nick is really enjoying the grind. He's a really dedicated guy. Well, that's nick. (lisa) I think it's admirable, You sacrificing your career to raise your child. It's what we women do, isn't it? Always sacrificing. Well, yeah, we gotta sacrifice sometimes. But I would imagine with nick's new promotion You could afford a nanny So that you could go back to work, Just to give yourself a sense of purpose Outside the four walls. Well, you probably have errands to do. (jen) yeah, yeah. Maybe I'll look into getting some help So I can find my purpose again. (lisa) oh, I didn't mean anything by that. I'm so sorry if I offended you. (jen) no, no, not at all. (lisa) have a good day. (scoffs) (sighs) Hello? Jen? Julianna? Hello? Julianna? Jen? Hey. Hey. Where have you been? I've been calling you. Oh, yeah, my phone was on silent. Okay. You all right? Where were you? (jen) you've been so busy I didn't expect you home so soon. I was at yoga class. I'm gonna renew my teacher's certification. Gotta keep the competition away. (nick) what competition? Where's juju at? (jen) at my mom's. Can you pick her up for me? I really need a shower. (sighs) "miss you"? Oh, hey, babe. What's up? Nothin'. Are you sure? You look a little weirded out or something. Yeah, I'm gonna go pick up juju. Okay. (nick) hello? I know this is really last minute, But I need you to come in to work tomorrow. (nick) on Saturday? We keep getting pressure from the investors On the app's release date. We can't keep pushing them back. I promise not to keep you the entire day, But I really need you, nick. (nick) I'll be there. I knew I could count on you. What's wrong? (nick) I don't know. (jen) is there something out there? (nick) nah. I think the lights are malfunctioning. I'm gonna go check something out. (jen) what's wrong? (nick) the motion sensors are on a timer, But they just got shut off instantaneously. (jen) I thought you said you disconnected them. (nick) no, I thought I did too. Huh. That was weird. (jen) I think you should leave that at work from now on. (nick) yeah. Yeah. (jen) nick? (nick) nothing, it's probably just a bug or something. Come on, let's go to sleep. (jen) do you really have to go into work today? (nick) yeah, I'm on a deadline And under a lot of pressure to get it done. So we can expect to not see you On weekends as well as nights? (nick) you think that this is fun for me? (jen) well, it makes you really unhappy, obviously, so, no. (nick) it's just a couple hours and then I'll be back. (jen) well, we might not be here when you get home. -Where are you gonna be? -Wherever I want. We all need hobbies, nick, and I can't just wait For you to come home every night. That's really pretty, baby. (juju) thank you. (sighs) Knock-knock. Hey. Are you all right? You seem a little off this morning. Me? Yeah. Just a little distracted is all. I know I've been asking a lot of you lately. I shouldn't have called you in today. Nah, that's not it. (lisa) what's wrong? (scoffs) I don't even know how to talk about it. (lisa) nick, you're more than just a colleague to me. You're a friend. You can talk to me. I saw a text message on jennifer's phone. And I just--I-- I don't know what to think. I mean, I always thought that we had This perfectly solid relationship. And I trust her so much, but... (lisa) you can't trust anyone. I hope that she appreciates you. You're a good man. And a good father. I need to go grab a cup of coffee. Come on, lisa. (lisa) you know you want this. (whimpers) What is he doing? Ah, hey. (jen) hey yourself. What's up? Uh, nothin'. I'm fine. Is that why you're talking to yourself in the mirror? (nick) I was just, uh, goin' over stuff from work. Okay. (nick) I'm gonna go hop in the shower. (slurps) Bob. Well, this is a nice surprise. (bob) don't. You don't think I see what's going on With you and your little wonder boy? (lisa) oh, is that what this is about? You're jealous. What do you think is happening? (bob) oh, think? Lisa, I know you, right? I'm not blind, I'm not stupid. Don't insult me. (lisa) I don't know what you're talking about. (bob) okay. Look, when this ended, I knew I wasn't gonna be the only one, all right? But do you have to do it with a punk That undercuts me at work? How do you think that makes me feel? What, you don't think I see how you look at him, hm? (lisa) baby, you're imagining things. (bob) don't "baby" me, lisa. I saw him leaving the office today. I know that look. (lisa) look, I don't know what you think you saw, But, really... (bob) you know what, maybe I oughta call corporate. Yeah, and let them know what you've got going on With a subordinate. And what if I told them it wasn't the first time? Hm? (lisa) well, I think that would be very unwise. (bob) well, I have every encrypted message We've ever sent to each other. Maybe I should share that with hr. I could probably get a pretty good severance package Out of that. What do you think about that? (lisa) baby, you're the only person That I've ever really cared about. Do you know that? (bob) come on, didn't I give you what you wanted? (lisa) no, you didn't. You knew what I wanted And you refused to give it to me. (bob) lisa, I can't have another kid. I told you that. (lisa) well, then I think there's nothing left For us to talk about, is there? (bob) you're delusional, you know that? You'd be a horrible mother. You would ruin the life of any child That lived under your roof. Look, I'm sorry. I really am. (screams) (seethes) (grunting) (pants) (grunting) (sighs) (sighs) (jen) the hell? (sighs) Hello? Hey, cass. Cass, cass, calm down. What's going on? Hey, something really weird is going on with my phone. Wait, what? Oh my god. Are you okay? B was. I mean, not only was he a boss and a colleague, But he was a wonderful person. He's caring, trustworthy. I went to him with problems on numerous occasions, As I'm sure you did. I spoke to his ex-wife this morning. She and the kids are obviously distraught, But they are still holding out for the hope That he might be okay. And maybe the message that we all received last night Was some sort of cry for help. I don't know. But I think that we all need to keep that hope up. The police may be circling by, So just take a minute and reflect On any interactions you may have had with him, Anything that could be helpful for them. We'll do a half day today, Unless you want to leave early, anybody, Or just take the day off. Nobody's gonna judge you. Completely understand, so... But just make sure you let your supervisors know That you're leaving early. Okay, all right. Thank you. Are you watching paint dry? Hm? Uh... (sighs) It's just shocking, you know? About bob? Well, I... Yeah. (sighs) No, I know. It's...Tragic. But we need to move on. (nick) excuse me? (lisa) bob was no friend to you, nick. We shouldn't waste any more time mourning a guy like that. (nick) I mean, he wasn't a friendly guy, But he didn't deserve to... -Right. -You know? (lisa) right. Nervous? What are you talking about? Are you afraid somebody's gonna come in? Ha-ha, lisa. Come to my place tonight. I gotta go home. To my family. Right... Right. And you think that I buy that? -Ugh, god. -Hey, hey, hey. Don't do that. (lisa) you need to get your head straight, nick. I'll see you at my place tonight. No, lisa. (laughs) (grunts) (sighs) Cassie, could you please send nick to my office? (muttering) Doesn't make any sense. Hey, burning that midnight oil again? No, no, I'm gonna go home at a decent hour tonight. Good, you should do that more often. Yeah, you're tellin' me. Ah, well, I'm off. Oh, yeah, lisa called down. She wants you to stop by her office Before you leave. Okay. Thanks, cass. (sighs) Come in. You wanted to see me? Yes, please. Nick, come in. Have a seat. (sighs) (sighs) To us. (nick) look, I shouldn't. To us. Look, I know that it's been a rough day. Everything going on with bob. But I see big things for us, nick. I need to go home. To what, your cheating wife? (stammers) Look, I don't know for a fact that she even did anything. Oh, right. Right, because a strange man's watch Just magically appeared in your driveway. Did... I didn't tell you about the watch. Yes, you did. (nick) no. (lisa) you've just been really stressed right now, You're not remembering correctly. (nick) no, I didn't. (lisa) okay, don't look at me like that, baby. What are you doing? Oh my god. Don't! Don't touch me. (lisa) you're really worrying me, nick. How could you do this to me? Do--do what? It's not that big of a deal. Nobody has to know. (nick) not a big deal? You hacked into my wife's phone. You made me think that she was cheating on me. (lisa) I was freeing you. That was you at my house the other night. You hacked into the motion sensors. Did you plant the watch too? (she sighs) Baby... Just... Think about... What we could have together. I mean, wouldn't it be so much better? You and me and little julianna. We could be a power couple, And I would be such a better mother than her. You. You made me. I made you? Mm-hmm. You made your own choices, nick, okay? Nobody put a gun to your head. You wanted this just as much as I did. I can't believe I... How could I do this? What have I done? You can't deny what we have. -You felt it...Too! -No! (screams) (scratches) (panting) (nick) you're out of control. Look, I'm sorry, but this ends now. (sighs) (groans) (screaming) (ice clattering) (panting) (exhales) -Rough day, huh? -Huh? (jen) you look like you've been through the ringer. Yeah, it's, uh... It's all hands on deck at the office right now. Hmm. -How are you? -I'm good! (she groans) Is that booze? Yeah, we, uh... We had a going-away party For one of the guys in accounting. -I only had a sip. -That's nice. Yeah, but all I wanted to do was come home to you. Is julianna home? She's on a play date. Can we talk? Yeah. You know that I love you, right? (laughs) I love you too. What's up? (phone-recording dialogue) you know that I love you, right? What do you think about me changing jobs? -Seriously? -Yeah, like, What if I found something new, Something with less hours, or even a remote position So that I could be at home with you all the time? I mean, that would be great, honey. I thought you were really excited About your new position though. I was. Well, we do miss you a lot 'round here. Yeah. Was it not what you thought it would be? Not exactly. And I just... I want to spend more time with you two, you know? No, no, no, no! (jen) well, that sounds great, honey. But whatever you decide, I'm with you. We might get squeezed a little. That doesn't matter. I just want you to be happy. No! (grunts) (jen) really. (sighs) (deep breath) Well, you said that your phone Was acting a little weird the other day. (jen) oh, yeah, it's been freaking out a little. (nick) have you noticed any settings changes Or icons missing? Now that you mention it, yeah. And the camera function on my phone Keeps opening on its own. Right. I think that the conexofi app Might have given our devices a virus. -Really? -Possibly. I think we should just keep our phones off Until I can make sure that they're secure. Secure from what? (sighs) The app has a back door That I haven't fixed yet, And it could give someone access to our devices. Well, there's nothing interesting on my phone. Like if our cameras are compromised, Somebody could be watching us. Who would want to watch us? For my sake, can we just... Can we just keep them off until I can reboot them, please? Okay. And, uh, your laptop too. No, I need that for my yoga certification! Plus, you never installed the app on it. Yeah, but it's connected to the internet. You're not the only one who needs to work, nick. (sighs) Done. (nick) thanks, babe. (sobbing) (panting) (groans, breathing heavily) (groans, sniffles) (panting) (sighs) (exhales) (sighs) (exhales) What are you lookin' at? What the... (sighs) (sighs) What happened to you this morning? I thought you'd want to sleep in a little bit. (nick) I couldn't sleep, So I took a look at your phone. (jen) how is my phone? I'd like to use it today. (nick) yeah, well, for the moment, you can. Just don't turn the bluetooth on, okay? (she laughs) Are you kidding? (nick) hey, this is important. I swear, I'm gonna get this glitch fixed today, And if not, then we'll get you a new phone. Immediately. (jen) okay. Nicholas sherman? Yeah? Detective ruiz. I need to ask you some questions. About what? We need to hear your version of events Regarding your encounter with lisa wolf yesterday. Our encounter? She's accusing you of sexual assault. No. That's not what happened. What did she tell you? That you two had an altercation in her office. Tell me, mr. Sherman, do you happen to have A large scratch on your chest? Why don't we go clear this up? You can come with me. (sighs) I don't know why I'm here. I didn't do anything wrong. I'm gonna need you to unbutton your shirt, please. -My shirt? -I need to document The laceration on your chest. (scoffs) (sighs) Hold your shirt open, please. Thank you. I don't know how many different ways you want me to say this, But it was consensual. Well, the thing about consent is, It can be withdrawn, mr. Sherman, at any point. (nick) look, I have common sense. I understand what consent is. I'm the one that withdrew it. She attacked me. -Mm-hmm. -I mean, I... I have evidence that she's been spying on my family. She has been using the technology-- I'm sure you do. We'll get to all that soon. I mean, she planned all of this out After I ended it with her. How long was this affair going on? It wasn't an affair. It was one time, And she tricked me into doing it. (chuckles) Look, okay, I know how that sounds, right? I regretted it immediately. So you engaged in sexual activity with her once. What happened yesterday? (exhales) She called me into her office, And she had champagne, So I could tell that she wanted to start it up again, And I wasn't interested, And then she grabbed me. And I--I pulled away, And that's when she grabbed my shirt, And then she kissed me, but I didn't kiss her back. I pulled away, and that's when she scratched me, and... And then I walked out, and that was it. (ruiz) so how do you explain the injuries then? Her cut hand and torn blouse? She claims that you came on to her in the office, And when she said no, you attacked her. I don't know how many times... I need to say this. She attacked me. What was your relationship like with...Bob barry? Bob, what about him? He disappeared from your workplace last week, And his family doesn't believe he died by suicide. He might've been divorced, but he was a devoted father, And yet there's no trace of him anywhere. (exhales) There was a note. Ms. Wolf claims there was a rather acrimonious dynamic Between the two of you, Especially after you took his job. That's not how that happened. (ruiz) she claims you might know something About what happened to him. (nick) you gotta be freakin' kidding me right now. This is a serious place, mr. Sherman. We don't kid. He committed suicide. That's the story. Do me a favor. Let's start at the beginning. (cass) she hacked jen's phone? (nick) to watch us. (cass) okay, then we'll show everybody. The prototype tablets keep a log of everything we do on them. We could show the police what she's been doing. (nick) yeah, but I can't go back in there. (cass) no, but I can when she leaves. I can't ask you to do that, cass. I'm not gonna let anyone else get in trouble because of me. (cass) this is our technology, nick, And she's misusing it. (nick) I still messed up, cass. -Everyone makes mistakes. -Not jennifer. She didn't, and I didn't trust her, And I cheated on her. (cass) lisa manipulated you, nick. Well, didn't I let her, though? (cass) we can fix this. (deep breath) -I should get in there. -Nick, We're gonna get your name cleared. Thank you for picking me up. I don't know what to say. (sniffles) So this is why You're never home with us? No, no, babe, it was one time, And it was a huge mistake. -Honestly, I'd never-- -honestly? So you're being honest now? (nick) I wish that it never happened. How could you do this to us? To me? (sighs) And that's why you had to fix my phone, Because it was her who hacked into it. She was spying on us. She made me think that you were having an-- (jen) made you? She didn't make you do anything, nick. (groans, sniffles) You're unbelievable. (nick) I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt you, I promise. Well, you did. Julianna, we're gonna go stay at aunt morgan's tonight. -Really?! -No, no, you can't go. You could be in danger, I don't know what-- If we're in danger, it's because you put us there. If you get lonely, just give her a call. That's right, you can't. (sniffling) (sniffling) -Jen. -Careful, juju. (nick) jen, please, I'm begging you Right now, don't go. (heavy breathing) (jen) hop in and buckle up, baby. Wait, where's my bear? (jen) we're not bringing it. Is daddy coming? (jen) no, baby, come on. Okay, honey. I'm gonna get your seatbelt for you, all right? (sighs) (lisa) hello, handsome. What are you doin' here? (lisa) I wanted to make sure you were okay. Are you out of your mind? (lisa) did you learn your lesson, nick? (nick) my lesson? I spent all morning in a police station. Well, I'm sorry I had to be harsh with you, But you weren't being a very good boy. I can make all the charges go away, you know. You just need to do what I need you to do. The charges? You ruined my family. (lisa) I was just trying to give you a better life. You've outgrown jennifer. I'm calling the police. No, you're not. -Yeah? -You wouldn't want Some of bob's personal possessions To end up in your office, would you, nick? Have the detectives suddenly find them? What are you talkin'-- You killed him? (lisa) you know, I hate having to use tough love on my men, But you give me no choice. (sighs) I don't want to talk about any ugliness right now. Julianna needs us to be a family. Let's just give her a stable and loving home. What do you want with julianna? (sighs) (groaning) I'm going to be the mommy she deserves to have. I know you're confused, baby, But once we get her out of the picture, You'll realize that this is the way it was meant to be. (sighs) You're awake. (breathing heavily) I made you some coffee. Are you thirsty? (sighs) I'll just put it right here. Just let me go, lisa. I swear I won't tell anyone. I can't do that, baby. Not while you're still struggling with reality. I know that you're feeling torn and you can't decide. There's nothing to decide, lisa. (laughs) Yes, there is, silly. It's that you love me, And that all you want is for us to raise julianna together. So, I've made it easy for you. What do you mean? You'll see. (panting) (grunting) Ah, what a good girl. She turned her phone back on so I can see where she is now. Lisa, wait. Please, don't do this. I'll be back. (groaning) It'll be okay. Damn it! (panting) Come on! Come on--no, no. Oh, come on! Not now. (sighs) It's really not that bad, So maybe we should just exchange numbers and informa-- (gasps) (cass) nick? Hello, I found the tablet, but, uh... (nick) cassie, thank god. (cass) oh my god! (panting) -She's gonna hurt her. -Lisa? (nick) she knows where she is and she's gonna hurt jennifer. (cass) where'd they go? -Where are they? -Okay, it's still connected To her phone. Rayborn state park. Come on, let's go. (groans) (feeble groan) (lisa) that's a disgusting sound. (panting) (groans) It's pointless to struggle. We're almost at our destination. (groaning) (exhales) Come on! (jen groans) Hey! That way. (groans) (groans) You know, we didn't have to end up like this, okay? I mean, you seem like you're nice enough. Why are you looking at me like that? It's not my fault, this is nick's fault! He's confused. (jen) he's not the one kidnapping me. (lisa) well, I know, but still... (scoffs) This just all could've been so much easier. But it'll be over soon. Still, I don't think that you understand That the problem is he can't make up his mind, okay? We have to do it for him. We have to give him the beautiful family That he deserves, That I deserve. (panting) You wouldn't want to get in the way of that, now, would you? Hmm, no, I didn't think so. (jen groans) Walk. (cass) the police are on their way. (exhales) To the right! Over here! (panting) (lisa) okay, baby, you hold really still, This isn't gonna hurt. (nick) lisa! (jen gasps) (lisa screams) -Get my wrists! -Are you okay? (panting) No! (groans) (lisa) are you okay? Are you okay? Look what you made me do! (grunting) Stop fighting! (grunting) (cass grunts) (nick groans) (lisa) baby, baby, are you okay? (groaning) (panting) (nick) I'm so sorry.
