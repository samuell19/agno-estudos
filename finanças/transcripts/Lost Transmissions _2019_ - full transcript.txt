Hello, it's Theo. Was at about half noon and then it all sort of merged into one and I got a bit confused, and I'm lost and I can't find her. But don't look for me.

Hello, could you direct me to whoever's in charge? You mean, the, the manager? This is the society calling. Is this you, Theo? You have such a pretty voice. It shouldn't be wasted on answering phones. Am I being recruited? Like in the CIA. What, those jokers? No, no, no, this is much more important. This has to do with the fate of the world. Wow. Where do I report? Uh, why don't you come by my studio when you're done with work? - How's that? - Mm-hmm. Cheers. - Hello, you came. - Hi, I did. - I'm so pleased. - Mm-hmm, thanks. Sorry to call you at work, I just knew that you would, uh, - pick up the phone. - No, it was nice. - It was refreshing. - Uh, do you want a cup of tea - or anything or coffee or... - No, I think I'm okay, wow. Cool, right? This is my little Aladdin's cave of, uh, musical treasures. - This is amazing. - It's just stuff I've kind of accumulated over the years, really. - Yeah, I'm sure. - This, this is the most recent acquisition. This is a upright that I got from the fire sale after, um, Spector went to prison. Yeah, so it belonged to him. - No. - Yeah. And, uh, what else? Oh, this is a, this was Chaka Khan's. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. And, uh, that's my first Wurlitzer. That, the e.p. there, give it a little tinkle. - So cool. - That's so cool. So what was, um, that society you were telling me about? It's just something I made up, it's just a silly thing. - Oh. - I know. Well, I have a pin, though. I made badges and everything. - Yeah. - So, it's kind of real, then.

Well, you were sitting on it a little bit, weren't you? You're sort of... You're holding it back. I, I've been on antidepressants since I was, like, 22, so it just, just shuts that part of me off, makes me a bit numb, you know? Sounds good when it's up here. I like it like this. Where'd you get these scars? - And here? - Uh, yeah. I drove into a tree when I was at my lowest. So I think it's better to feel numb than feel what I'm feeling, you know? Stay level, yeah. I just don't... I, I hate medication. Um, yeah, always have. Can I ask you a personal question? - Shoot. - And delve deep? - Mm. - Do you ever, ever consider coming off it? 'Cause, I mean, that was a while ago, presumably. You might be, you might be different now. - No, no. - No? Why do you ask me? I just think it's a shame to live life with a sort of, you know, with a filter over it, is all. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes I feel like I'm stuck in glue and I might not move again. Like an octopus with no legs. Yeah. Or a sloth that's sleeping. - Hey! - Boom! We should record some of your old songs. - What, really? - Yes, really! I think you've got something, I really do, you know, and I think I'm pretty good at seeing that in people. Okay. All right, let's just have a little, uh, warm-up, shall we? Get things flowing. Yeah, you want me to do some jumping jacks? You could do your jumping jacks if you like. People do strange things in there. Okay, come in, come in, are you receiving me, over? Yeah, receiving you loud and clear. Small aircraft requesting permission to land, please. Permission denied, I'm afraid. What, denied? Yeah.

This is a huge opportunity. I've got a line of songwriters down the hall trying to write for Dana Lee. This is where the money's at. Right. I mean, I can use that kind of money. Great, let me introduce you guys. Right now? Um. - Yeah. - She's here? Can you send her in, thanks. Hi, I love your stuff. It's so good. Wow, I... love those nails. - Oh, my God. - Oh, they're not nails. - They're claws. - Mm. - Right, Darron? - Right. - Darron knows. - Yeah. Anyway, I thought, this girl, she must've been kicked around, because it feels to me - like you know my damage. - Yeah. Uh, I'm sorry to hear about your damage. Look at her, look at her, look at this face. - I know. I know. - Look at us, look at us. - I told you. - Look, we could be sisters, right? - Easy. - Yeah! - Aw! Aw! - Perfect. - Who's who? - Of course. Just opposite sides of the same coin. - Oh, I call heads. - Take them, I will take the tails. Darron, I love her. I love her, I want her. - Can I have her? - She's yours. - Please. - Anything you want. - Great. - She loves you. It's great. You know, when a singer finds a writer they think sounds like them, they hang on for life. So, have as much ready as you can going in, and say hi to Theo for me. Oh, I actually haven't been able to get a hold of him lately. You haven't? Uh-oh. I was coming to find you, because I wanted to tell you the good news. Darron wants me to write for Dana Lee. How cool. Thought you might be a little more excited than that. You're not singing though, are you? It's, it's still a big opportunity though. Where's your car? Why don't I drive you to it? - Theo? - Yes, love? Where's your car parked? I'm having trouble recalling that at this juncture. What juncture, what? I mean, I don't know where I've parked it. What is going on with you? Fucking hell! Hey, what is... - Are you on something? - No, no. Hey. Are you sure you're okay? - Do you want me to drive you home? - Yes, please. - Yeah? - Yes. - Are you sure it's the right key? - Yeah, it's the right key. It's the right key. It's definitely the right key. So, what, is the, is the lock broken? No. It's Rudy. It's my landlord. He's changed it on me. Why would he change the lock? He's so grouchy. - Come on, we should go. - Theo, are you being evicted? If you listen really carefully... you can hear their transmissions. - Okay. - Shh! Um. It's, it's there. It's just, just, just underneath. It's underneath. Just stay here, okay? I'm going to be right back. - Hey. - Hi. How's it going? Um, it's okay. Uh, I, I actually, I have Theo here with me. - Oh, cool, where is he? - He, um, he's just in the car. Um, he's acting really funny. - Funny like how? - Um... I don't know. He's, uh, he's being weird. He's, he's just not making any sense or anything. Oh, God, not again. What does that mean? Come inside. What happened? Well, back when he was touring with the band, they were doing a lot of drugs. I mean, they were completely bonkers. One of the craziest bands of the '90s. And one time he got dosed with something bad, some bad acid or something. And it triggered something in him, a schizophrenic break, and he was never the same, in and out of mental hospitals for years. His medication actually handles it really well, like, he's lucky like that. But sometimes he stops taking it. He didn't tell me he had a mental illness. Hey, Theo. Hey, chippy chops, what's up? Are you feeling okay? A little off maybe, or... - anything? - I'm fine, I'm fine. I think I've really got something here, listen. Um, it's static. No, underneath the static. They communicate on these channels. And they can also send other signals over the radio waves in frequencies you don't even hear. - I can't, I can't hear it. - Well, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen. - Theo, come on. - Listen. Theo, please, Can you turn that down? It's really loud! - Please turn it down. - Hey, Theo! - Theo. - Theo! I have your sister on the phone. - Theo? - I don't want to talk to her! What the fuck! I told you, I don't want to talk to her, all right? Jesus Christ. You need to relax. If I say I don't want to talk to her then I don't want to talk to her. Okay, okay, Theo, you don't have to. - God. - Liv, I'll call you back later, okay? You need to just chill. Theo, come on, we're trying to help you. Well, you're not. Okay, Theo, how can we help? Tell us, Theo! - They keep calling about the car. - Who does? The leasing company keep calling about the car. They said if I don't make a payment they're going to take it back. - But you lost your car. - No, I didn't lose it. I forgot where I parked it, didn't I? Different. Okay, well, where were you when you were last with it? I was shopping in Beverly Hills. Okay, well, let's retrace your steps. - Yeah. - Give me the keys, - I'll drive. - Okay. Come on, Theo. Theo! - What? - Come on, we'll take you back to your car. - No. - Why? Because, I'm not going with her. What, why not with me? She's wearing that sweater. What is... What's wrong with it? It's yellow, isn't it? Fuck! Oh, God. What is it this time? He was talking about being watched. Oh, well, we all know that's true. I mean, our phones are listening to us all the time. Does he know about this? I told him we were having a party, 'cause he loves parties. - Hello, everyone. - Hey. - Hi. - Can we get something to drink? Uh, we're having an intervention. - Oh, that's cool. - Wait, it's not for me, is it? Uh, I know I drink a lot, but it's not a problem. - I promise you guys, it's not an issue. - Hey, guys. - Hey. - Where is he? He's just out here. What happened? He stopped taking his medication. He took the mushrooms on Halloween. Did you give those to him? No, absolutely not. - He asked, I... - You should know better. But I don't know his deal. Is that, is that what set him off? See, this is so frustrating. We've been through this so many times with him and he still messes with his medication. I mean, who does psychedelics on anti-psychotics. Sometimes they do it to self-medicate. It's hard to tell what comes first. He's definitely got a problem with the booze, but that is not the issue at hand. His dad was a wine merchant. I thought he was a vicar. He was, he turned to God to save his liver. He was always the life of the party when I first started Night of Noise. It's his sense of humor that saves him. He's so funny. You know, he says the same things when he's normal. It's just when he's off his meds he actually means all of it. He's calmer now. He took a double dose of his medication and it seems to have worked. His family said they're going to send some more over from England. And then if he takes them regularly for a couple of weeks he should straighten out. We just need someone to watch him. Well, here we go. Listen, Theo is one of my best friends. Now I've done this for him two times already. I was managing the tour when he had his first break. It was the scariest fucking thing I have ever witnessed. His last slip, he was stayed on my couch for the entire time. He nearly gave me a nervous breakdown. But we're getting older. My girlfriend just moved in, I can't put this on her. I'm sorry, no. It's someone else's turn for once. All right, you guys, hey, I'm sorry, but I couldn't handle that right now. Understandably. We leave for tour for a week. - Yeah. - I just rent a room here. Okay, well, what about his family, huh? - Well... - Can they do it? ...there's his dad, but he won't go to him when he's like this. It's just up to us, I'm afraid. Hey, you. Hey, chippy chops. - What's up? - I don't know. - Just selling my soul. - Don't say that. I'm sorry, don't say that. Look, I just, come here. I, I just don't see you as just being like a cog in a big machine. You know, I know, I know there's more to you than that, you know? But if this is what you want to do, it's a huge break. You know, so don't worry about me, for God's sake. Yeah, well, you're the only reason I'm getting a huge break. I just need to rest. - You know, I'm pretty tired. - Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I know, I know I'm a huge pain. Look at your eyes. You look like you're doing better. Aside from crashing out of my life and having to rebuild everything from scratch. You've already done so much though. I don't have anything to show for it. I got a flat-lining career. I got no family. Who'd want to be with me? That's not true. It is true. It is very true. I scare people. You don't scare me. I don't? Mm-mm. Earlier, by the car, I was scared. I was really scared for you. But you don't scare me. Okay, uh, so, you can take the couch if you want. Um, or we can both sleep in my bed. Oh, no, you're okay. I'll just stay on the couch. It's fine. It's probably better anyway, 'cause I snore, so. Oh, okay, cool. Well, um, I need to do some work. So, why don't you just make yourself comfortable. - Thanks, love. - Yeah, of course. Okay. Do you have any fly pie? What? No, that's gross. My mom used to make it. Really, you like real flies? - That's disgusting. - No, raisins. I thought the flies were like... Oh, no, I meant, uh, the raisins were like flies. Oh, yeah, I could see that. What are you... - Are you counting my blinks? - No. Um... what about... You want to watch some TV, maybe? I can... uh, find whatever you want. Yeah? Okay. Okay. I think it's time to take another pill. No, I don't want to. No, Theo, you won't. That... No, come on. - You have to take this. - No, I don't want to. - I told you. - Please, Theo, I... It's, it's important to me. Well, you're on Toliset. All right? That is the worst one. That sucks time. Okay, but it, it does work for you. You just have to take it consistently and it's going to help you. I don't agree and I'm not going to take it. It, it's, it... You don't have to agree, it's just true. - It's going to help you. - I'm not taking it. - Please, Theo. - You can't make me. It's true, I can't. All right. Well, I got a session booked with a band, so. No, you need to relax. - Well, they've got the studio booked. - Just, I... Theo, I don't think you're in the right state to go and do something like that. - I think... - I really need the money. Damn. Okay, wait. - I'll, I'll... We can go. I'll take you. - Great. But I need you to take one of these first. No, I'm not taking it. Fine, then we're not going. You... All right, look, you... I'll take, I'll take, I'll take the pill and then... Okay, give me the pill. All right. Uh-huh. Can we go now? I'm sorry, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry, God. It's okay. It just gets a bit, uh, you know. All right. Slam the door behind you. - No, it's not. - It's an abbreviation. - You can add the letters. - Abbreviations are... Hello, chaps. Hello, chaps. Oi, oi, saveloy. - Sorry I'm late.

Just don't let them know about his condition, - 'cause we don't want it getting around. - Got it, yeah, well, if he... We won't mention anything.

What, because you don't like it? Tough. You only have to bear it for a little while. You really like this better? I can't go back to London because London is a place in my past. I can't go back to the past. If I travel, I'll make a ripple. A ripple? Yeah. Explain that, please. In space time, if I, then... If I... If there's a ripple, the feather will feel it and they'll find me. If you go back to London, you won't be going back into your past because you would be going there now. So it would just be a geographical distance, that's it. You don't get it. I don't. I can't go, I can't leave because I can't leave my wife. What wife? They won't, they won't let us be together yet. Her father, her, her, her father is time of the little things. She is the princess of time. I am time of the sea mammals. It's not ea... I, I... It's not easy to explain, I can't just... Theo, no one is after you. No one is trying to kill you. It is all in your head. Can you not see that? Your head is playing tricks on you. You have schizophrenia. You're so smart, Theo. You are one of the smartest people that I know. Can't you see that that's what's happening here? You can outsmart this, I know you can, I know. You're a tricky little minx, aren't you? Theo, please. That is the truth. Look at me, that is the truth. Hey, what is your, what is your gut telling you? You have to trust that feeling. Please listen, please, Theo. Please let me help you. Okay. Okay, if you want to help me get me out of here. Yes, you just have to agree to go to London. No, no, no, I absolutely... I am not going back to London! Okay. - Okay. - I tried. Okay, goodbye. So, Mr. Ross will be leaving here with you today? Uh, no, no, he isn't. We have it down here that he is. What do you mean? He's on a 5150. We can only keep them for three days, then we have to release him. Uh, no one else is scheduled to pick him up? No, no, no, you can't release him. - He's really not well. - We can't commit anyone unless they willfully commit themselves. He's paranoid. I mean, he thinks that everyone around him is trying to kill him. He's not going to willfully commit himself, is he? Can I speak to a doctor, please? Fuck. Hi, hi, thank you, um, listen, you can't release my friend today. He's really not well. And he needs to be on his medication for at least 14 days before it actually starts kicking in. Okay, we can only put him on a 5250 under three conditions, if he presents as a danger to himself, he presents as a danger to others or he presents as gravely disabled. - Look, Theo's sick. - Uh-huh. He's just not sick enough for us to force him to stay. Well, can you give him another evaluation? - We don't do second evaluations. - What? Then, I mean, what is it that you're doing here? Um, okay, I know that you're just doing your job and that this is the protocol, but this is how you can actually help somebody to get better. Right? Please give him a second evaluation. Okay, do you know where you are? Uh, I'm at the, the Elysium Psychiatric Facility in Los Angeles. Okay, have you had any thoughts of suicide or homicide since you've been here? - No. - No? Okay, and when did these symptoms first start? Uh, probably about two weeks ago. I was, um, working a ton and I was producing two albums at once, under a lot of stress. And, uh, I was having real difficulty sleeping. - Ah. - And, um, I think I was dehydrated as well. You know, sleep deprivation can make you feel a little funny. No, hey! No, he, he sees assassins. No, he, he told me that people are after him and that they want to take his watches and they want to wipe out time. - That is what you said to me. - I know, and it must have sounded very loopy. - I get it, but my friends... - No, no! - My, my friends are worried. - Theo, that's... - He's not telling you the truth! - I have delicate nerves. - You're lying! - I always have. Oh, my God, you liar! I spy with my little eye something white and fluffy. - A cloud. - Yes! Oh, you're good at this, I shouldn't have even started playing this with you. Uh, do you want to have a go? Okay, I'm going to, I'm going to go again. And then see how you feel. I spy with my little eye a rock. A big floating rock. The Moon? - You got it! - Mm-hmm. It really is just a big rock, you know. - Sure is. - Come on, then, you go. - I don't want to. - Come on, please. It'll make everything... I spy is like... It just solves... Okay, I spy with my little eye something beginning with an orgy. Bugger, what? Yeah, over there. That field of flowers. - Ah. - They're sex organs. - Did you know that? - Yeah. - Horny flowers. - Yeah, I suppose they are. - Mm. - That's a good one. Uh, okay, I spy with my little eye, uh, waves. Where? We're, like, not near an ocean at all. Oh, wires. No, no, no, no, no, ju... No, everywhere. - Like radio waves? - Yes! Radio waves, everywhere. All sorts of radio waves. Big, small, soft, hard, mean, nice. God, I wish I could feel that. You can, you can. Already, you can. Just don't be afraid of it. We're, we're so kind of, uh, comfortable with just using our names for everything, you know? It's like, as soon as you name something, then it's just locked. Oh, you know, that's a chair. He's cool. She's a Carol. - - Do you know what I mean? It's like, we've constructed, like, a whole made-up world, and it stops us from seeing everything how it really is. Yeah, you, you might be right about that. Yeah, yeah. But your theories don't quite add up, Theo. No, I... Yeah. I know, I know, I know. I admit, I do admit there are holes but I am so, so very close. I am so close. I mean, why on earth would they release him? - Are they morons? - Obviously. I don't know, 'cause the state doesn't want to pay for him. And Theo doesn't have insurance. The system is fucked here. It's completely broken. And in England it's different. I mean, there he has health care, for one, and they could keep him in the hospital and the medication actually works. Right, we need to get him back to London. Oh, my God, wait, he's running away. - What? - No, right now, he just... He ran away, Theo! Hannah, I can't hear you. Wait, Hannah, what happened to Theo? You're breaking up. Hannah... Hannah, are you there? Must be the waves, shit. Anybody home? Yeah. Sorry, oh, wow, I'm like, really out of it. - Are you sick? - No, I'm not sick. It's not that. Oh, yeah, well, I get it. Me too, I'm so wrecked. I'm so wrecked. - I was so high last night. - Hmm. I was totally tripping. I like, I had to call 912. What's 912? It's like 911 except for when you're, like, so high that you're just freaking out and you just need someone to be like, "It's all right, man." "Not everybody hates you. Drink water, sit in a chair. You don't have a brain tumor." "Your face isn't melting." "Your face isn't melting." - "You're not crazy." - "You're not crazy." - "Definitely." - "This is going to end. You might feel crazy right now, but you're going to come out of it." ♪ I'm so high ♪ ♪ I don't know if I'll ever not be high again ♪ - You know? - All right, all right. I'm not mad at it.

Give me a minute. I think I can make this work. Um, I really don't think that you should be partying right now... Shh! I'm trying to concentrate. Okay. This, this, this is, this is all wrong, right? This is, this isn't happening. - It's not right. - Her vibe is way off. Yeah, your vibe is off. You got some harsh shit you're packing there, little miss. You need to trim your frills or you're going to get cancer. Yeah, don't hold in stress. Yeah, act out your impulses. Theo, um, I, uh, thought that you said that you needed to relax right now. This is relaxing. This is exactly where I should be right now. And you. You girls are in perfect time. You guys, let's go to outer space. - Yes. - Yeah. What? She said, "Let's go to outer space." - No, no, no, no, no! - This is going to be weird. Come on, no! - Yeah! Yeah! - What is that? That's mushrooms! - No, Theo, come on. No, I... - Yes! It's a brill... It's a great idea. - It's a great idea, stop. - Don't you... No, Theo! Tuck in, chirpy chops. - Feel it! - Whoa! Off to the wild side. - It's so warm! - You can do it. I believe in you. Yeah! Yeah! Oh, man, can you see the ghosts? Ghosts are ripples. When we pass, we imprint ourselves on the atoms around us. And ghosts are memories that electrons have. Mm, that makes sense to me. But sometimes, what you bring with you triggers the ripple. But I don't want to bring... I don't want to bring anything with me, I try not to. You know... I can hear voices, too. Theo, I hear... And they're really harsh and critical and mean. And then, I can't even hear my own voice, you know? And, and it becomes so loud. And then it's, it's this, this void. Well, the only way to stop them is just let them out. You know, just ride the wave. To the shore, it's not so bad. I don't know. I don't want to do that. I don't want to feel that. Yeah, stop thinking. What are you feeling? There we go. That's it, that's it, that's right. That's right. As soon as you let yourself feel, then the real you can just be. Without your head getting in the way. Yeah? And that's beautiful, feel. If you can put that into your work, then you're going to come up with something really great. Okay? Yeah. It's the only way. Just feel. Watcher's watching among us. What are you looking for, son? Bring your own gold. Your own nebula. All right, that's it! I'm not going to run anymore! - All right, what do you want? - What's this guy doing? Is it this, is it this? Why don't you fucking take it? Hey, hey, Theo, Theo! - That's not cool, man. - Theo, what is happening? Easy, easy. - What? - There's something out there. Come on, let's go. Mm-mm, mm-mm, no. - Theo. - No. You know what that is? Yeah, the observatory. It's so much more than that. Hey. Shit. Theo. Wait. Theo, where are we going? Theo, Theo! That's trespassing! Oh, my God, shit. Wait. Shit. Goddamn it. Theo. Theo. LAPD, stop. Put your hands in the air. - Oh, my God. - Stop, this is the police. Come out with your hands in the air. Repeat, come out with your hands in the air. No, it's just a misunderstanding, okay? We were not breaking and entering. I was just chasing after my friend. - Look, we were not breaking and entering anywhere. - I recognize you. You're like the Nazi I met in Auschwitz. Get your fucking hands off! Fuck you! Oh, my God! No, no, no, no, no, no! Please don't shoot! Please do not shoot him! Do not shoot him! Hey, no, no, he's mentally ill! - Hands on the ground! - Please, oh, my God! Uh, I have the papers in my purse! You can get the papers out of my purse! Please, please. He's just been diagnosed as a chronic paranoid schizophrenic, okay? Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - Oh, God! It would be the worst place for him. What the fuck! Get off me! Get your fucking hands off me! No, no, oh, my God. No, no, please, please. - 6815, we're detaining... - Oh, my God, he's just been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, okay? Don't arrest him, please don't arrest him. - He, he cannot go to jail. - We can take him to the hospital, but it's dangerous for him to be out here on the streets. I know, I know, I... but... Please, will you tell a doctor that? If that'll help, ma'am. Oh, my God, thank you. Fuck. Jesus Christ. He looks terrible. I know. God, mate. God. Have you been feeling strange at all lately? He's so charming. I mean... These doctors, they just... God. Here we go again. I tell you, these doctors, they just don't care. They just want him in and out of here as quickly as they can. Adrenal fatigue can be quite draining. Any thoughts of suicide? Uh, only if you can die from embarrassment. - What, is he drawing something? - Damn it. What's he doing? What is he doing? That's the symbol for the society. How do you know about that? Are you a member? 'Cause I, I haven't seen you before. And we need to debrief you. Those feather pricks have been trying to stop me from erasing all the negative energy that's accumulated in the world, from all the terrible events throughout history. We've gone ahead and admitted him to a 5250. - How, how did you know... - Thank you very much. - ...to do that? - We use the LEAP method here. There's listen, empathize, agree and partner. It rebuilds trust, and eventually they trust you enough to listen to your advice. Oh, so, you just, you, you go along with him? It's clear that he can become violent when under stress, and his police record indicates that he has a restraining order out on him. - What? - By a, a... - a Wendi Sotto. - Oh, Christ, yeah. That's the girl Theo was seeing. Whenever he has these slips, he becomes obsessed with her, thinks she's the princess of time. - She's a real person? - Yeah, yeah, she is. I didn't know that. - Hey. - I thought you were different, Hannah. You're just the same as everybody else. Come on, I want my next hit. Is this a fucking joke? So. - Hey, Rachel. - Theo's out again. - What? - He called that girl, Micah. Micah, the girl from the party? Yeah, he told her he was being locked away, and she contested the 5250. Rudy's not going to let him in. - I don't know where he's going to go. - Okay, I'll be right there. I'll see you soon. - I, uh, I have to go. - What fucking bullshit is this? - It's an emergency that... - I don't care what it is. I'm a professional. I only work with professionals. This is my time. My time is very valuable. My minutes are literally worth millions. So I don't know who you think you are, but you are a nobody. Do you have any idea who I am and the opportunity that I am giving you? Yes, I have seen all of your albums credits. Dana Lee has 20 different songwriters, an army of session musicians and a team of suits. Good luck with the new album. Theo? Hey. I'm really sorry that we did that to you. We just, we wanted you to be somewhere safe, you know? Theo, I really don't want you to be here. I don't know if you'll ever come back from here. Please don't give up. Don't let go yet. I know that you're in there.

My name's Hannah. I'm a friend of Theo's. He's obsessed with me. You're the princess of time. You guys got to stop saying that. Okay, sorry. Somehow, I got wrapped up in his illusions. He started coming to the store. I had to hide in the changing room while my employees talked to him. But he would just straight come to the one I was in. It's just like, he knows. Sometimes I think he's actually tapped into something. Well, I wish he would leave me out of it. He is a person who is suffering. He's my friend. You can help. When we're together, we're happy. Time stretches out. You feel that, right? We, we create time. What we feel makes the shape of reality and, and everything else possible. I love you, Wendi. What, what's between us, what we feel, our love could save the world. It's the only thing that could make everything all right. It all makes sense now. You two belong together. Wendi, you are the princess of time. And Theo, you're the time generating mammals of the sea. You can travel in time, together. And Theo, he would travel anywhere to protect you. He would travel anywhere for you, right? Right, Theo, I've been offered this job in London. Would you want to come with me? Uh, sure. I was going to go anyway. Okay. Oh, hello, this is, this is Stewart. I, uh, I went to Heathrow. He wasn't there. I went right to the gate, he, he must have slipped by me somehow. Um, Hang on, it's him. Theo, where are you? That's my question for you. I'm not in London, Theo. I'm in Paris, I'm going to be here through the weekend. Why don't you stay in London and check yourself into a facility? I'll meet you there. Like you were going to meet me here? I'll be okay, I'll come to you there. Theo, please. Please do this for me. The only way we can be together is if you go into the hospital. And we can generate time from there. You're lying to me. You broke my fucking heart. You and me, we could've done it, you know, we, we could've stopped the world from crumbling apart and, and stopped all the bad men from ruling and taking everything and everybody hating and killing each other. You and me could've done it, but we fucking didn't. And now that chance is gone. It's fucking gone, time is speeding up, and, and we're just racing towards the end, and it's just going to get worse. Until the planet dies. And all the animals and all the beauty and all the life is just gone. God, it's just going to be over. I don't even know why I'm trying to stay alive anymore. Theo, Theo. Oh. I don't want to be around to see that. Oh, my... ...In western China. The death toll is now to be 400,000. What. What have we, what have we done? Hello, Theo. It's good to see you, son. You're looking well. I'm sorry Dad, um... We're totally screwed from this time on. Hey, did you put the 421 in channel four or channel five? Uh, it's in four, I got the 58 in five. All right, tight. Dude, you got to come out to the show next time. - I know, man. - Johnny absolutely shreds on bass. Hey, man, can you roll 300 off the Neve on channel two? Yeah, we don't need it. And there's phantom running to it, right? Great. - Hey, Hannah, you good? - Yeah. Good.
