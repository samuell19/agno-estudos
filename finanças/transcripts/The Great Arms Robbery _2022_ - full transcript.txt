The terrorist attack took place 3 days ago is still brewing. Citizens are questioning the anti-terrorism team. The city government says there will be new actions to eliminate terrorism and make the city safe again. Sorry, the number you dialed is busy. Please call again... Mr. Li. Are you all right? I'm good. As soon as we send these arms to the destination, you'll be retired. When your daughter finds out, she will be so happy. The target vehicle is locked. Ready to intercept. Terrorists are rampant. The city government decides to disband the anti-terrorism team and form a new team. Anti-terrorism... The city government has a strong will. Will? Anti-terrorism. You think us, the anti-terrorism team is merely a display? General Qing Sheng. Anti-terrorism is none of your business, right? Anti-terrorism team can obey. But... Shouldn't the city government... It's the city's decision. All you need to do is obey. Initiate the bomb. Everyone, don't stop. Don't slow down. Keep driving. The signal is disturbed. Vehicle engine stalls. Brother Wen, the car is under control. Mr. Li, the body armor. Their firepower is too strong, get back to the car, now! Mr. Li, watch out! Drop your weapon! Drop the weapon! Now! - The warhead is in our hand. - Good. Don't leave a loose end. Clear. Qing Sheng. This batch of goods is quite important to me. You have to help me this time. Sorry, general. I'm afraid I can't help you this time. I'm just a small arm dealer... Do this. I won't treat you badly. It doesn't matter to me anymore. I'm too old. It's time to take a break. All right. If that's the case, I won't force it. "Munitions Hijacking Case" "Police" This is the crime scene. We've got control. The army van was robbed. 14 deaths. To all police officers in all units. Get back to work. Block all exits of the urban area. - Go! - Copy. Be prepared. Your father might be in trouble. Come over. And here. Take a look. Check out nearby cameras. See if there are any witnesses. Okay. What's going on at the scene. 14 dead bodies were found at the scene. On-site survey. Both sides have melee weapons. The identity of the deceased has been confirmed. Li Yin-xiong himself and his bodyguards. Why are you hiding from your dad? I am a policewoman. Our standing points are different. Even if you were the sheriff, you are still my daughter. If you are no longer in the arms business, I can go home and have dinner with you every day. But if you continue to do this, I will never see you again. Don't be upset. Everyone! Polish your guns and destroy the clothes. Yes, sir. Captain. Monitoring and interception equipment are all set. The communication networks of 26 police stations and the alarming system are all under our surveillance. Our technology can delay the police's communication channel for more than 3 seconds. Come on, get ready. Everyone! Here is a briefing. Based on clues from our informants, our preliminary judgment. In last night's arms robbery. 4 cluster ballistic missiles went missing. The 4 warheads are tactical weapons designed for large-scale indiscriminate attacks. Once there were a few warheads left in the war-torn area. After the war, some of the warheads were sold to international terrorism organizations and one of them was used and released in a terrorist attack, causing a devastating disaster. If the criminal organization that robbed the warhead use it against our country, such as launching a terrorist attack, it will be a disaster. Stand up. Sit. "45.8 kg" General. A total of 4 high-explosive cluster missiles were intercepted. Every missile contains 4 independently guided cluster warheads. The explosive power is equivalent to 5000 kg of TNT. So far, in the whole world, these warheads have the most advanced technical standard. We couldn't find the lockbox. What? One of Li Yin-xiong's men ran away with the lockbox during the act. You. Clean up your own mess! Yes, sir! Wen Lai is still alive. If you can't pull the trigger on him. I'll find someone else to handle it. Find him, and his suitcase. Understood? Don't you disappoint me again. 1.2 kilometers away from the crime scene. A 24-hour convenience store's probe facing the street took this. It was 1:37 in the morning. Facial recognition comparison showed that his name is Wen Lai. Close ties to victim Li Yin-xiong. Before the incident, the two were in the same car. He is the only known survivor of the case. We cannot rule out the possibility of him cooperating with the robbers. Wen Lai. Professional agent. Served in special forces. Rich practical experience. Strong sense of investigation and anti-investigation. Post a wanted for him. Citywide manhunt! If the target is found with a lockbox. Kill him instantly. Act now! Yes, sir! - Ready for action! - Copy, sir! Secretary. Given the peculiarities of this case, it'd be better if you don't participate. Let me get you out of here. My foot is stuck. Let me help you. You go first, leave me alone. - We must leave together. - No. The box is important! You go first. Don't bother to save me. Hurry up. Be sure to protect the box. Otherwise, too many civilians will die. - Go! - Take care. Go! You are injured, don't move. We have a situation. Hand it over. Sir, don't worry. Please say it again. I was downstairs of my house. That's when I saw the wanted gun robber on TV. Captain. Military has anti-terrorism operations in a block. Okay. Notify the police not to intervene. - Be vigilant. - Copy! Li Nian. Doctor. It's too dangerous here. You have to go. Stop! "Police" Stop! I'll shoot if you don't stop. Put your hands up, where I can see it. Turn around slowly. Nian! I'm sorry I failed to protect Mr. Li well. I'll explain. Handcuffs on. - Nian. - Get on the car. All right... Walk. Nian, I don't know anything. I will investigate the truth and give Mr. Li... and you an explanation. We the police will find out. "Police" "Police" Li Yin-xiong has a few mass destruction warheads. Someone asked the EO to locate. I'm aware you and Li Yin-xiong are close friends. If you take this mission, you'll be handsomely rewarded. I promise you. After it's done, she'll leave the EO. Are you okay? - Call the ambulance. - Okay. What's the problem with you? Don't you know how dangerous it is to work alone? Starting today, you can't take part in all field actions. When you are back to the police station... Join the logistics to sort out the information. Did you hear that? Yes. Is this the only way to see you? How did you get attacked? The ambush location was carefully designed. Car first, men next. Rifle, submachine gun, light machine gun. Reasonable combo of firepower, neat teamwork. Such meticulous action is not what average robbers can do. In my opinion, this is likely to be related to the anti-terrorism special forces. Let's get out of here first. You are wanted. So, am I popular? Take that suitcase and get it over with. Yes. Give the suitcase to the EO. You and I can get out of the mission. Do you know... I've always been thinking. You are better than me in so many ways. Just can't lie. What do you mean? The route and timing of the Arms, only the EO knows. You'd better stay out of it. Joan. You must help me. Fight terrorism is imperative, it's what the people hope. Any individual or any organization will not stop our country in our approach to peace. Sacrifice sometimes is inevitable. But if I lose the queen, it is possible to lose the whole game. Go. Find the lockbox. Yes, General! "Police" He has served overseas for 10 years in special forces. Many medals, many secret missions. After retiring, all his information is gone. It is now crucial to find Wen Lai. Find more clues. Did you hear me? Heard! - Yi-bo. - Here, sir. - You're in charge of the first block - Copy. Allen, you're in charge of the second block. Copy. Let's go. Let's go. Jeez. My God. Are you messing with me? Well, I'd say it's good to see you escaped. Who robbed the arms? You know that I cannot tell you that. Li Yin-xiong has 4 high-energy warheads in his hands. I need your help to find the location of the them. We will absolutely accomplish the mission from General Qing Sheng. General. Li Yin-xiong handed a file to the police on July 21. According to our man, the file number is 34789.

What are you doing here? "Police" What are you doing? What are you doing here? What are you looking for? Look at this rough sea. The bottom is even more turbulent. I'm deeply stuck in it. Counter-terrorism and terrorism coexist. They won't let me live. I'll let them die. Believe it or not, me, Qing Sheng, can blow up a city to show them. It is said that. Mr. Li has a high-energy warhead? Sell them to me. I'm getting older. Not the same as before. It's time to give up. How did you find me? It's not hard to find you. Don't move. Bear with it. You know... It would be nice if the time can stop at this moment. I hope that one day, this will happen again. Just like now. Wen. I feel so lucky to have met you. You know why I can't come with you. My family is in their hands. Sorry. Wen. Report. 3:15 PM We found Wen Lai in the Eastern District. Report. Found Wen Lai in the East End parking lot. Wen Lai appears in Eastside supermarket. Act now!

You can die in anyone's hands. Handing over the suitcase for your safe departure. I won't go. Wen, don't force me. You can't do it, can you? Let me help you. My job is to kill you to get back the suitcase. Now you are happy? Come on. You think I don't know that you unloaded the bullet in the middle of the night? It's ok. I'll give you one more chance. This time, let's be serious. It's no longer safe here. Let's go. I know you can't bear to kill me. Why is the military here? Don't know.

Now! Go, quickly! Go. Hurry up! Grenade... Seban. Seban, stay with me! Seban, wake up! You can't die. Seban. Joan! Protect the lockbox! Go! Take care of yourself. I will cover you. Go! Good work. General Qing Sheng. This is my gift for you. Good! Nice doing business with you. Soldiers! We're taking back what we deserve! Our voices must be heard! To blood and honor... "Count every vote" "The peace agreement is about to be signed" Look at these politicians. Such ugly faces. General Kim is very dissatisfied with the situation now. Today, I will give you a hand! Our nation have been trough a bumpy road. Finally, this is the chance. What do you mean? This is a latest High-energy cluster missile. One can level a stadium. I see, you are crazy! What do you want?

Dad is a bad guy. But now, I'm going to do something good to save the country. When this is done, I will retire. You've said once. You will have dinner with me every day. My daughter, dad is proud of you. That incident, you really helped a lot. The government no longer pursues your past and gives you permanent residency. Many thanks. Enjoy your freedom. Thank you!
