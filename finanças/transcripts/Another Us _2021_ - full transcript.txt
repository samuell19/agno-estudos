Burn that witch! Burn that witch! Burn that witch! Burn that witch! Burn that witch! Burn that witch! Burn that witch! Burn that witch! Burn that witch! Burn that witch! - Hey, Casey, Casey! - Burn that witch! Burn that witch! Burn that witch! Burn that witch! Burn that witch! Come on. Go. Go save my sister. Emily! Emily! Oh, shit. Did see Jasmine today? - No. - Man, she was looking all kinds of good today. Jasmine wouldn't give you an hour of her time. Man, all I need is five minutes. - There's your girl. - Hey. - Got something for you. - I bet you do. Pervert. Give me your wallet. We're not even married yet. And you want my wallet? Married, huh? Can you even get so lucky? Huh. There. Now your wallet is complete. Well, minus the money. Hey Casey, you want come over later and play some 2K? He can't Kyle, he's busy. - I am? - Yeah. We're hanging at your house tonight. Yep, y'all are already married. You can hang out with us too, if you want. No, I'm not really a third wheel kind of guy. We have to hang outside tonight then. Why? My dad didn't go to work today. You don't want me in your house when your dad is here? You know that isn't why. The least amount of interrogation, the better. I don't know what I did to make him hate me so much. He doesn't hate you. He didn't used to. He treats me completely different now. Maybe he's jealous we have something my parents don't. Being the third wheel has officially begun. Oh, hey, I forgot. I have to work for a few hours before I come over. You guys want to stop by? Do you want to, Kyle? I could eat. Can we get free food? Only is Rick's not there. Alright. See you guys in a bit. - See you, Kyle. - Bye, third wheel. I didn't see Rick. Did you? I don't see his car. Speaking of cars. When are you getting yours out of the shop? I don't know. If I ask my dad about it, he'll start lecturing me again. Why did you even let Emily borrow the car? She had plans to visit a friend who had just moved to Maryland. Her car was in the shop. Did you guys find out what happened To the other driver? No, all we know is she was in pretty bad shape when they took her to the hospital. Why did you not just tell him that Emily wrecked the car? I can't tell him the truth. He already gives me a hard time about her as it is. That's my girl. Free food, courtesy of Rick's On The River. No, free food courtesy of Emily Mallard. Thanks babe. What, no tip? Do you love me? Yeah. Why do you love me? 'Cause you're hot. What? Do you love me? Of course. Why? 'Cause you're an asshole. Since when does complimenting someone on their hotness make them an asshole? Oh. Come on, Em, don't look at it. She wants me home for dinner. Skip dinner. You can have dessert right now. And who's the asshole? You never did answer the question. What question? How quickly you forget. What? Do I love you? Yeah. I said of course. So, this is so you don't forget. What, what are you, what is this? My dad is going to kick my ass when he sees that. Uh huh. Em, stay for five more minutes. Pretty sure your family wants you inside by now. I don't want to go inside. It's the weird anniversary night. That's why my dad stayed home from work. Tries to keep my mom's mind from wandering. What anniversary? Promise you won't think less of me or my family? Less than I already do? A few years before Chloe was born, my mom was pregnant. But she didn't know it. She went skiing with my dad. And she fell and had a miscarriage. Now, every year on the anniversary of that day, she mourns the death of her baby. Well go be with her. I can't, it's like she wants us to mourn with her. And I can't mourn for someone I've never met. It's just one day, pretend. Em. How about three more minutes? Case, we got forever, remember? I'll see you at school tomorrow. And don't forget, I have a doctor's appointment, so I'll be late. So glad you could join us. You know what today is? Yes, mom. She still outside? Who? No. She just left. What schools did you apply to today? I'm going to apply to some tonight. You said that last week. You spend more time with this girl, it's gonna cost you. Her name is Emily, dad. You talk about her like you despise her all of a sudden. Honestly, I've got nothing against the girl. We're just worried that you're spending too much time together. We're actually not, mom. Are y'all having sex? Jesus, mom! I'm done. Pick up your fork. Your mom didn't cook this for nothing. Are you done with dinner or this conversation? Both. Oh, a package came today. Damn it. It's too big. It can be resized. Or you could just wear it on your penis. Chloe! Mr. O'Reilly said that your car should be back on the road by the end of the week. Good. You wreck it again, I'm taking the keys. It's not his fault that a deer ran out in front of him. He doesn't look after anything. I'll bet you he loses that ring before graduation. You got something to say? Nope. Come on, Kyle. Damn it, are you tying to get me killed? If I die, I'm going to kill you. Well then you go in first. Yeah, I'll talk to Emily about it tomorrow. If I get her to set you up with Liz, you owe me. Damn it! I'm dead. No, that's enough for me. No, I'm going to walk to school tomorrow. Emily has a doctor's appointment in the morning. Yeah, I'll ride home with her after. Okay, see you tomorrow. Having fun? Living the dream. Emily can't drive me to school tomorrow, so do you think you can drop me off? Hand me that screw driver, while you're standing there. So can you? Why can't you take the bus? I don't want to take the bus. Plus, I'd have to get up 30 minutes earlier if I did. So your leg's broken? Forget it. Did you say something? Hand me that rag while you're there. Casey? Casey. Holy shit Casey, are you okay? How am I not dead? If I didn't push you out of the way, you would've been. What? You were almost roadkill, man. Where did you come from? What do you mean? Kyle, seriously, I was walking alone. If you believe that, we gotta get you checked out by a nurse. Something is definitely up. Emily never came to school today. Huh? I tried calling her, but some guy answered and said I had the wrong number. Last night, she asked if I loved her. I wonder if she's pissed off that I didn't actually say the words. Who's pissed off? Emily. Who is Emily? Can you be serious? Look, if she had a change of plans, she would've texted or something. You didn't hear anything at school, did you? About what? - Are you even listening? - Oh, I'm listening. Should I be worried? Listen, I know that almost getting hit by that car scared the shit out of you. I mean, it scared the shit out of me, but... There's not even a scratch on me. Okay, you look fine, but you might have hit your head. Why are you talking to me like I'm crazy or something? You're not crazy, I just think we should get you checked out. Are you really going to keep playing this game? Okay, so... If you're dating Emily, then why did you talk about asking out Becca? Who the hell is Becca? Okay now who is playing games? When did I talk about asking her out? When aren't you talking about asking her out? It's all you could talk about on the walk up. I mean, before the car interrupted the conversation. Alright, keep playing. Okay, first, we'll get you checked out. Second, we work on getting you laid. Lack of sex can mess with a man's mind. You've got to be kidding... You've got to be kidding me. Mom! What? Where are all of Emily's pictures? Emily? Is that your girlfriend? I'm serious. Where are her pictures? Did dad do this? Well, since you didn't say no, I'll take that as a yes. Mom. I don't know what pictures you're talking about. Look, it's okay that he doesn't want us together. But you know what? No, that's not okay. He needs to keep his mouth shut. He has no right to touch my stuff. Where are you going? Be home for dinner, I'm making meatloaf. Nat, can I talk to your sister? I need to see Emily. Mom. Crazy guy's at the door. Mrs. Mallard! Yeah, go ahead, go to the other room. Mrs. Mallard, can I talk to Emily for a minute? I think you have the wrong address. Wait, Mrs. Mallard, I really need to talk to your daughter. You want to talk to my daughter Emily? Who are you? Come on, Mrs. Mallard. What, is my dad paying you to keep her away from me? I don't know who you are. I was just over here two days ago having dinner with you guys. You told me how surprised you were that after two years, we were still together, and that you thought we were a match made in heaven. Those were your words. Who is us? Me and Emily. Look, she just gave me this picture yesterday. You want to know where my daughter is? She's in Oak Hill Cemetery. Why? Because that's where we chose to bury her. What? What happened? Does it even matter? I would've brought flowers if I thought for a second that you might actually be here. I'm sorry. I didn't say it yesterday. I love you. I'm sorry that I couldn't protect you when you needed me to. You're not, you're not supposed to be here, Em. This can't... This can't be right. Emily Mallard, five years old, was found dead in a shallow creek bed less than 10 miles from her home in Fairview. Coroner's office has released a statement stating that the cause of death appears to be strangulation. Emily was last seen by a school bus driver when she was dropped off in the afternoon. The bus driver didn't notice anything suspicious during the stop. There are currently no suspects. No, Kyle can't be right. I know my life, and I did not just imagine the last two years, okay? No... Hey, Kyle. Hey, can you meet me at Rick's tomorrow? No, I need to talk to you in person. No, I'm... Very much not alright. Yeah, that works. Okay, I'll see you then. Why here of all places? Two reasons. One, I knew I'd be hungry. And two, this is where Emily worked. I thought being here would make me feel close to her. This place has been closed for years. We ate here yesterday. We as in me and you. This may take a while. Okay, what's going on? I know I seem like I was losing it yesterday. I was, but I'm worse today. Alright, but... Apparently you were right. Emily doesn't exist. Well, she did, but she was murdered. Did you do something? I didn't do anything. She was murdered years ago, and no one has any idea who did it. Please just hear me out, don't judge me. Okay. Look, you and I have been best friends since fifth grade. First grade. Are you saying that's not true? That's really not important. Look, something is really wrong. It's like I'm in a dream that I can't wake up from. Either something is happening to me, or something is happening to everybody but me. Am I sensing judgment? No, no judgment here. You just got me on the edge of my seat. Look, I've been dating Emily Mallard for the last two years. You've known her as long as I have. One day, we're talking about going to the same college, being together forever, and the next day, she doesn't exist. Well, she did, but she's been dead for 12 years. Listen. I want to believe you. I'm not saying I don't. But you're saying I've known this person for years, but I don't remember them. Unfortunately, it's not just you. No one seems to remember us being together. It's not just her being gone that's different. I've noticed several little things that are just, odd. You're noticing things that are odd? Okay, so, let's retrace your steps. What happened yesterday? I decided to walk to school. Because Emily had a doctor's appointment in the morning, and I was going to ride home with her in the afternoon. - Son of a bitch. - What? I got hit by that damn car. You know how I know you're not dead? 'Cause I can feel, hear, see, and touch you. But I know for a fact that I was walking alone. I felt the impact of the car. Okay, all I know is that we were walking together. There was a car barreling towards us. I pushed you out of the way. We were almost in body bags. Okay look, I know you're helping me, even though you don't believe me. - I just, I... - Hey. You would do the same thing for me. Right? I don't have to believe you to help. I really appreciate this, okay? You're a really good friend. Hey, don't start all that sappy shit. You're gonna make me blush. How is the best brother in the world doing? What do you want, Chloe? Come outside and play basketball with me. Why? Because I'm bored. And because I love you. See, that is more proof. Chloe hates me. Yeah, sure seems like it. Not her, my Chloe. Okay... Oh my god. What, what did you find? This is it. Dr. James Morris is a physicist at Dahlgren College in Virginia. He's had multiple papers published, but he says that the only, that one nearly caused him to lose everything. One of his theories pertaining to life after death made him a laughing stock to many of his peers. He believes that when one passes away before their time, they are instantaneously transported to another place. Not the heaven that many hope for, rather an alternate reality where the former deceased live out the remainder of their life. Okay, well, if this is what's happening to me, then other people should've experienced this, too. Why have I never heard anything about this before? He says that the theory can never be officially proven, because once their conscience inhabits the host body, they will have no memory of the life they left. Instead, they will be filled with the memories of the alternate reality they just entered. So then what happens to the consciousness of that reality? - Do they merge, or? - I have no idea. I didn't write this. Okay, well, if this is really what's going on, then why do I remember everything? Occasionally, previous memories may leak through. Those memories are easily dismissed as either a false memory, or referred to as Deja Vu. It looks like we are skipping school on Friday, and having ourselves a three day weekend. Why? We are going on a road trip. - Okay, where? - Virginia! Are you kidding? No. Did you eat all the Oreos? We've been driving for like five hours. I got hungry. Well then we need to stop and reload. Okay, can you wait 30 minutes? Because we're about to be there. You ate all the chips, too? All I have are Fritos. Going on trip with you is like going on a trip with my mother. How so? 'Cause when you get hungry, you get hangry. I'm not hangry. I'm just hungry, nervous, and frustrated. That is literally hanger. Whatever. Have you thought about what you're gonna say to the doctor guy? No, not really. I mean, you can't just go and be like, hi I'm Casey, I'm from a parallel universe. Can you take me home? I know. I'll just wing it. Okay that's not a good idea, either. Like, you only get one shot at this. Thanks for easing my nerves. Okay and this whole thing is not confirmed. This is a theory, and he doesn't even know if he can get you home. Well, before I can worry about that, I have to get him to talk to me. Then I have to get him to believe me. What did you tell your parents about this whole weekend? I didn't tell them anything. What the hell, man? Fairview Sheriff is gonna have a missing person's report out for you. Look, if he can help me get home, whatever's left here means nothing to me. Which also means no consequences. Well screw you, then. I guess nothing means anything, anymore. I didn't mean it like that. If your parents call the cops, they're gonna search my house. Okay? Actions have consequences, Casey. Okay, so I'm not thinking things through. I'll text my mom in a bit. If I'm gonna be putting my neck out for you, you need to start thinking shit through, okay? Kyle. Are you hangry? - We're here. - Now what? We do what we came to do. I mean, all these buildings look the same. Well there's the administration office. Do you want me to go with you, or... No, you don't have to. I'll be fine. What are you gonna say? I guess I'll just ask to speak with him, and then go from there. Okay, I'm going to go with you. You're totally gonna mess this up. Hello? Anybody here? Hi, can I help you boys with something? Hi. My friend wanted to ask you a question. Hi, I'm Casey. I was wondering if I could speak to Mr. Morris. - Dr. Morris. - Doctor, yes. Dr. James Morris. Dr. Morris' class ended at one o'clock today. Oh. Now what? Go home? Oh but if you hurry, that's his car, and he's walking to his car right now. You might be able to catch him. Oh thank you so much! I could kiss you! That's what they all say, but they never do it. You're going to be my wing man, right? Okay I don't think this is like a wing man type of situation. Well, how do I start the conversation? You're gonna lose the opportunity, so go, come on! Excuse me! Excuse me sir. - Hi. - What can I do for you? We would like to talk to you about your theory about parallel realities. I will gladly deny that request. That can of worms has been sealed long ago. Please, Dr. Morris, we drove almost six hours to see you. Who's we? Hey back away, I will call campus security. We can't leave. We need to talk to you. Hey. In life, we tend to do things that need to be done. You could still be a good person, but not proud of your actions. This guys teaches? He's nuts. Sir, I promise you, we aren't wasting your time. Let us agree to disagree. Alright well, this was a wasted trip. Like hell it is. Just hear me out. Why? So I can let my guard down then you shoot me? - What? - Jesus no! We just want to talk to you about your theory. Do you know who I am? Of course, we read all about you online. There's no such thing as alternate realities, okay? The Science Fiction Channel knows more about the subject than I do. It's not just a guess, it's a fact. And I have proof. Oh really, where is this proof? You're looking at it. Hell yeah, he's the proof, asshole. Sure I can't get you guys anything to drink? Some water, soda. My old friend, Whiskey? No sir, we're good. Just call me James. Oh we're on first names. Guess we're friends. I wasn't talking to you, asshole. Now... Have we ever met? No, no, no. So it's out of order. What's out of order? Nothing, I was talking to myself. Now enlighten me. What's the story? - Alright, so. - Hang on, hang on. Don't mind if I record this, do you, for research? No, of course not. So, how many of past lives do you remember? Just the one. So no sudden flashbacks or strange dreams? Yes, there's this one dream I've had several times. Where I'm trying to save this girl. She was accused of being a witch. And people were cheering as she was set on fire. And you couldn't save her? No, I was held down. Who was this girl? My girlfriend, Emily. I think. I never get close enough to see her face. It wasn't a dream, okay? Your mind, it's opening up to past memories. I suspect you've probably been chasing this girl for some time now. Really? So, what's the last thing you remember from your past life? I got hit by a car on my way to school. But that's not how I remember it, though. But Kyle wasn't there. I mean, he was there afterwards. Like, immediately afterwards. But he wasn't there when I was hit. And he was telling me about a conversation we were having. And you don't remember this conversation? No. What was this conversation about? Oh, so I can speak now. Nevermind. Have you noticed any other differences beside your friend here appearing in an un-recalled conversation? Yes, my girlfriend, Emily. No one from here remembers her but me. Except, in this reality, she was... She was what? She was murdered. Before the Casey from here ever had a chance to meet her. How did you and Emily meet in your reality? Look, with all due respect, I don't want to waste your time. I know this sounds crazy, but I swear. Hey, I believe you. I do. You do? You're not the first person that has retained memories of a past life. So there are others. I only personally know of one other that has retained his memory, I should say. Who is he? I can't give you that information. Just as I wouldn't give out your identity, should someone ask about you. Well, can you tell us about him without saying who he is? Sure. Like you, he died well before his time. Like you, he also was trying to get back the love of his life. Although each reality had its differences, there was one particular event for him that was a constant. His wife always kept dying in the same way. Not on the same day or location. That made it really difficult for him to stop it. That's terrible. No matter how many times he jumped realities, no matter how much he tried to save her, she always died in a car accident. An accident caused by the same individual. That sucks. So were you able to help him? He never came to me for help. In fact, he's still here. He's in this reality. I thought you said his wife kept dying. Did he give up on trying to save her? He would never do that. He found the solution here, and that's why he stayed. His experience does differ from yours slightly though in that not only was he traveling through multiple realities, he was landing within those realities in different time frames. So there's two of him in this reality? No. Just as Casey has taken over the Casey from this reality, with full memory, the other guy was taking over his counterpart in different realities, but doing so at different periods of time throughout his life. I don't, I'm not following. Okay, imagine waking up tomorrow in your ten year old body, but remembering everything up to today. Oh. Well alright. So, how did he die the first time? He hung himself after his wife died. Damn. Speaking of wives, gentlemen, mine's about to be home soon. So can we wrap this up? So, does this mean you can't help me? Actually, I can. I am starving. I don't mean to like, kill your hope or anything, but I don't know if I trust that guy. I don't know if I trust him, either. But right now, he's my best chance. Damn it, I said no pickles. Don't you think it's weird that he thought we were going to kill him? I don't know, maybe he's in to some really dark shit. So what was your Casey like? Eh, pretty much the same. What was your Kyle like? Exactly like you. Well, you can't beat perfection. I'm so hungry, but I can't eat. All I can think about is tomorrow. I'm gonna actually try to get some sleep. You sleeping on the driver's side? Doesn't matter to me. Ah, I see you made it. We would've been here sooner, but, you know, this wasn't exactly the easiest place to find. Yeah, the GPS didn't tell us what tree you were at, so. We needed a location where we can get the job done, where there's no witnesses. - Oh! - Whoa! No, no. - So we die, we die? - Relax, relax, relax. I'm not gonna shoot you. You're gonna shoot yourself. What? Told you this motherfucker was crazy. I'm not going to shoot myself! Okay, each reality exists on its own vibrational frequency. Just because we can't see the other realities, doesn't mean that they don't exist. What? Alright alright alright. Think about the radio station that you were listening to while driving here today. Could you hear multiple stations at the same time? Does that mean that other stations don't exist? No, just change the frequency and there's another radio station. You're saying me shooting myself is like changing a radio station? Exactly. Do not listen to him, Casey. In order to see other realities, you need to change, or shall I say, vibrate over to that frequency, which is what you did to get here. I don't even know how I did that! Okay, when you got hit by that car, your conscience, it left your body to continue living. It isn't until we die of natural causes at an old age that we stop changing frequencies. Okay, so you're saying, I shoot myself and then I just magically wake up back where I came from? Well, no. When you got hit by the car, that body was left in the street. And that Casey, even more than likely, has already been laid to rest. What? You can't enter other realities that you don't exist in. So you're saying my friends, my family, and Emily, are all just mourning my death? I mean, yeah if they like you. So if he does this, does my Casey come back? No, assuming Casey does do this, his body will be here probably until it's discovered. So you're saying my family loses me twice. Unfortunately, since there's no one way back, your next best option is to pick another location. If you like it here, you can stay. But if not, just... Okay, so I lose my best friend, and I don't even know if this works? I can't, I can't make this decision right now, okay? Look, the last time I left without saying any goodbyes. Plus, I can't let Kyle drive home alone. If I'm going to do this, things need to be done right. How much longer? Like an hour and a half. But, you're not going straight home. Where are we going? Well, you told your parents that you were gonna be at my house, so that's where you're going. Haven't you spent enough time with me and my issue? Hey, a promise is a promise. What's that supposed to mean? It means my parents are at my grandma's tonight. Yeah. And what did I say your brain needed? Kyle... No. Casey... yes. Alright, who's ready to get fucked up tonight? There! Get to drinking! Hi. Becca. Well, it looks like you guys need some refills. I will be right back. Kyle, really, I'm good. Oh, no you're not. So, Kyle was telling me you've been wanting to ask me out for a while now. I'm sure he did. Why haven't you asked me out? - Well... - Sorry, am I being too blunt? It must be the liquid courage. Speaking of liquid courage. So I got you guys some refills. Becca, did you get a chance to tell Casey what we were talking about? - It didn't come up. - Oh. Becca here is a sexual being. And how exactly did that come up in your conversation? I asked her to tell me about herself. And that was just first thing that came to mind? - Liquid courage. - Liquid courage. So if you guys need anything, I will be here, somewhere. Honestly, I like you too. Oh yeah? How come you've never said anything? I guess 'cause I was sober when you came here. I know, liquid courage. Do you want to dance? I think it would look a little funny if we were the only ones dancing. I don't mean down here. And I don't mean standing up. Come again? God I hope so. Okay, no, look. I think you have had way too much to drink, and I don't want to take advantage of you while you're impaired. Well you've been drinking, so let's say that it's me taking advantage of you. I, I, I have a girlfriend. - What? - No, no you don't. - No. - Yes I do. No, you don't. This is still cheating. Hold on, do you or don't you have a girlfriend? - Yes. - No! Look, I'm sorry. You seem really nice, and I really, really wish... I'm offering myself to you. Do you accept my offer? I'm sorry. Jesus Christ, man. Hey Jason. Did I ever tell you how hot you look in that shirt? She's a freak. Yeah, she's a freak. That's the point. Look, I'm just going to head home. Wait, are you good to go? You've been drinking a lot tonight. I don't think I've drank so much that I can't walk three blocks. Well, I... Guess I'll see you later, then. Alright. Thanks for tonight, and for everything she was going to give me. Thanks for everything, man. Mom, dad, Chloe. By the time you find this letter, I would've left this world behind. I will have entered a new world, that may not be the best, but hopefully it's better for me. Please know that my decision has nothing to do with you guys. You've both been great parents, and even though you couldn't give us everything you wanted, you gave us everything we needed. Including love. Chloe, you may not have been the sweetest sister, but you were mine. Know that just because you can't see me, I'm still around. Kyle, I'll see you soon. Love, Casey. God, he better be right. My head. Am I still drunk? Ready for tonight? Yeah I'm ready, baby. Yeah, stop that. What? 'Cause the kids are here. No, they're still asleep right now. Mom, are you going to see an Elvis impersonator? It's not impersonator, it's the real deal. You know Elvis died, right? What? Whoa, when? In the 70s. Phew. You had us there for a sec. Wait, are you telling me you're going to see the real Elvis tonight? Casey, you bought these tickets for us for our anniversary. Yeah, it's a farewell to the king concert. So he's retiring. I mean, the man is in his 80s, so he's got to call it quits sometime. Oh, and if we haven't already said this, thank you, thank you very much. You're watching your sister tonight. Please don't forget to feed her. There's pizzas in the freezer. This will be a good bonding experience for you both. Embrace it, you guys won't be under the same roof for too much longer. Don't let anyone in the house while we're gone. Especially Kyle and his girlfriend. Kyle has a girlfriend? I wish you would find a nice girl like that. That would be nice. Why are you leaving so early? I thought the concert was tonight. Three o'clock, lazy bones. You slept through breakfast and lunch. You've got to go to bed earlier. Kids. See ya. Chloe, dinner. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize Chloe had friends over. There's more pizza on the stove, I can just... Ha, you're funny. Oh, after we eat, can you take me to get some more makeup? Mom said I can get some new stuff. Mom? Yes, ding dong. Mom, you know. The woman that pushed you out of her vagina 17 years ago. Wait a minute, my mom is your mom. Nice job! Next time, I'll teach you who grandma is. Wait. Do we have any other siblings? What are you smoking? So we don't have any other brothers and sisters. Nope. Has mom ever mentioned having had a miscarriage? No. You're what, 14 years old? I'm not playing this game anymore. Just take me to get makeup, and I won't tell mom if Emily and Kyle come over. How long does it take to buy black makeup? There's different shades. How many different shades of black are there? Hey, you're not supposed to be on your phone while you're driving. Hey, Kyle. What's up? Yeah. Hey, I was wondering if you wanted to hang out at my house for a little while. Oh, sweet. Hey, can you see if Emily wants to come, too? Perfect. Yeah, we'll be there in about five minutes. I'm taking my... sister home. Yeah. Okay, see you there. Bye. Go take a shower. I just did. Do it again. And this time, don't use cologne as soap. I only put on a bit extra because it fades after a while. Someone need to teach you - what a little bit extra is. - Okay, you know what? I have a fun idea. Why don't you go fold clothes in your room? I was done anyways. Hi. Hey Casey. You're here. Yeah. Okay, hi. I know we're friends but we don't gotta share everything, right? You have any food? Yeah, there's some pizza. Hey. So how have you been? I feel like it's been a month since I last seen you. It's been more recent than that. No, I don't think so. When will mom and dad be home? Later, but you'll be asleep by then. Hey Chloe, I like your lipstick. What color is it? Oh, it's black. It's Devil's Delight, actually. So where are your parents? Oh, apparently I got them tickets to an Elvis concert for their anniversary. That's sweet, you're such a nice guy. Man, your mom loves Elvis more than she does your dad. I bet you she gets all hot and bothered at that concert, and you're gonna hear those bed springs being tested out tonight. Gross. Yeah Kyle, there's young ears around. I really like your perfume. What kind is it? I was asking 'cause Chloe wanted to know. I didn't ask. - Let's go. - Yeah, come on. Oh already? Sorry, I'm tired. Okay well, do you want to do something tomorrow then? Maybe. Hey, you know, I think I somehow lost your phone number. Can I get it again? Oh yeah, I don't think I ever gave it to you. But sure, it's actually the same as Kyle's, but the last number is five. Oh, matching phone numbers. That's cute. Well you know, you can come with us tomorrow if you want. I don't know, my mom's cleaning tomorrow. She wants my help. Well, that shouldn't take too long. She's been tearing the house apart, looking for this necklace my grandma left me, but before she died. So it's gonna take a while. The one you keep in your underwear drawer? How do you know what's in her underwear drawer? I, I was just, guessing... How does he know what's in your underwear drawer? I don't know. I'll text you later. Stay out of my girl's drawers, okay? What the hell was that? Way to play it cool. What do you mean? I saw the way you were looking at her. You did. Yeah. So did Kyle. You don't understand, Chloe. I have loved that girl longer than I can remember. You'd had years to make a move, and you didn't have the balls to? Kyle did. Move on. I have to talk to her alone. That is so wrong. What if you were with Emily, and Kyle tried to talk to her behind your back? That's just it, he's not supposed to be with her. Whatever. Just don't say I didn't tell you so. You know... You're starting to grow on me. Good morning. You sure seem happy this morning. I can't complain. Must have gotten it all out of your system last night. Yes, I did. How was the concert? It was absolutely awesome. For a man of his age, he sure knows how to move those hips. Hey where's dad? In bed. He's exhausted from last night. Gross. Get your mind out of the gutter. Hey Casey, what are your plans for today? Would you like to go shopping with me and Chloe? Shopping for what? We just need to pick up a few things. And I told your sister I would get her some makeup, since you did not last night. What? I did.. I forgot. I did not do that, yes. I'll probably just go and hang with Kyle and Emily later. You two can have a girls day. You know you're not too old to hang out with your mom. I know. Next weekend, you and me. I'll hold you to that. Hello? Hey Em. It's Casey. Hey what's up? Are you still cleaning? Yeah, almost done, finally. Let's hang out tonight. I really need to talk to you about something. I don't know. You know how Kyle gets when he's jealous, he's angry. Kyle has anger issues? Has he. I didn't know that. How could you not? Oh, hey, I'll talk to you later. Who was that? That was my dad. What did he want? He wanted to see if I wanted to see a movie later. Oh yeah, yeah. Emily, can you help me move this? Coming! Huh, you got a text. Oh, thank you. So who was it? It's my dad again. Must really want to go to that movie then. Yeah. What time is the movie? He wants to go at 3:00. So, what's on your mind? A lot. Well, I'm here. Yes. You are. You sure have been smiling a lot since yesterday. I miss you. I mean, I'm happy to see you. I'm happy to see you too. Really? Why are you acting so strange? Do you love Kyle? Why are you asking me that? Do you? Yes, I think. I'm just going to be blunt because I don't know if I'll ever get this chance again. You should just say it. I have loved you for so many years. Maybe you shouldn't say it. Wait, don't go. I need to get this off my chest. - I'm dating your friend. - I know. But you're not supposed to be. We are supposed to be together. Kyle suspected this last night. I told him it was just paranoia. He did. Why didn't you say this before? I mean, before Kyle. I would love nothing more than to give you a full explanation. Unfortunately, the truth is hard to believe. I can't believe this. I thought you were just having girl trouble or something. I am. Does Kyle treat you well? Yeah, most of the time. On the phone, you said he has anger issues. Has he ever hit you? Not once. He has come close a couple times, though. Then why are you with him? He was really sweet at first. And I think I feel bad for him 'cause his dad. Where's his dad? He doesn't talk about him much. He rarely comes up in conversation. Kyle and his mom moved here alone a couple years ago. Wait, so you're telling me I've only known Kyle a couple of years? A little less. Hey babe. Yeah, we just got to the theater. Yeah, my dad says hello. Alright, I'll call you when we're out. Bye. He thinks you're with your dad? For what it's worth, I did have a crush on you in eighth grade. You did? So, I was talking to this guy the other day. He's a doctor, actually. - Not the kind that operates. - Yeah. He said my life may not be perfect, but there are ways to make it better. This is better. You know, Casey Lewis, you're a really good guy. I'm surprised some lucky girl hasn't scooped you up yet. I'm hoping she does. Would you want to go get something to eat tonight? Sure, but what about Kyle? Tell him you're seeing a double feature. Okay, just play it cool. This is your one chance to make things right. Except you'll be losing your best friend in the process. Stop talking to yourself and get out. What did I say about washing with cologne? Hey friend. Why the hell are you doing this? Doing what? I seen the way you've been looking at Emily. I mean, I can't blame you, I mean, every guy looks at her like that. But you, of all people. Look, Kyle, you don't understand. Oh I fucking understand! But it's one thing to look. But to act on it? Acting on it how? Jesus Christ, man, I saw you two at the docks. Okay, I think it's time for an explanation. Oh this ought to be good. What do you know about parallel realities? Shut your damn mouth! Do you think you're better than me? You think I'm stupid? Me and Emily have been going together for a month now. And now you decide to cross the line. I'm not trying to cross any lines. You were so close to being the brother I never had. I would have done anything for you man. - Kyle, listen. - No you listen! They say that blood is thicker than water. Since we're not brothers, we're not even friends. You're nothing more than dog piss to me. Listen, Kyle, I can tell you've been drinking. Just go home, sleep it off, and we'll talk about this tomorrow. Where are you going, Casey? All showered. Smelling good. You're going to see her, aren't you? - Kyle, just go home. - No you're gonna go tell her how much of an asshole I am. And what I've been doing. And that she should be the one with you instead of me. I'm not gonna let you take away the one real thing that's in my life. Casey, are you okay? You're like choking. Shit, Kyle! You stabbed me! I stabbed you? Quick test. Who is Dr. Morris? Is he one of the guys from the hospital shows? Did your dad beat you as a kid? Okay, you need to take some deep breaths. Just answer the question. No, my dad did not beat me when I was a kid. Bring it in! You know I don't like this sappy shit. I'll catch up with you tomorrow. Okay we're not done with the game. I don't even know what this is. Alright, well I guess I'll see you later, then. Are you good? I'm not bleeding, so yes! Hi Casey. Hey. Hey, come try some of this crab dip. It is so good. Mm, this is good. Where'd you get it? Your mom made it. She did? Don't act so surprised. Your mom's gonna be the next Martha Stewart. Hey dad, what year did Elvis die? In the 80s. Why? That's close enough! Chloe! - You're back! - Get off. You just called her Chloe. Yeah, I mean, that's her name. Don't hurt your brother. Why didn't you name her Chloe? Don't you think it'd be a little odd to have two kids with the same name? Why are you looking at me like that? Wait, you're here. Which means you never had the miscarriage, and popped out a third kid. What is wrong with him? Hey Peyton, come try the crab dip. You look like a Peyton. Wait, what happened to all the goth makeup? Oh, Casey, a package came from Amazon for you. I put it up on your bed. Yes, my class ring. I didn't know high school dropouts get class rings. Hey hey hey, stop it. At least he's getting his GED. Mom, what is this? Oh, the baby's not even born yet, and you're already calling me mom. Em! You're here. You look like you're gonna pass out. No, no, I'm fine. Wait, you live here? Oh... oh my gosh. You're... You're pregnant. It's mine. Don't make me smack you. What has gotten into you? I love you. I love you. I love you today, and tomorrow, and for the rest of our lives, Emily Mallard. Well, it won't be Mallard for long. We're getting married! Are you gonna stay up or are you gonna go to bed? - Yes, yes, yes. - Were you drinking at Kyle's? No no no no no no no, shit. You know, you've got to be the most beautiful pregnant chick I have ever seen. That's too sweet. You're gonna have to keep this up even after you were up all night. Oh, I don't think that should be too hard. What are you looking at? There was this scary homeless guy on the street earlier when I pulled up. But look at this. Isn't this adorable? Can we help you with something? Oh my god, he's got a gun. Dr. Morris? How do you know who I am? Why, so I can put my guard down and you shoot me? Do you know who I am? It's out of order. You son of a bitch. In this reality, she was murdered. She always died in a car accident. Why did you even let Emily borrow the car? We found the solution here. That's why we stayed. There are currently no suspects. Emily?
