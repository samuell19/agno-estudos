Start from last night uncle Yung took us to eat at Mei hsiang restaurant you drank with mr chen, then mr Chang then toasted to chu lien gang, and another gang you drank, drank and drank what happened then? I lost consciousness how could you have lost consciousness? I drank because you were so elated... I didn't know those people how could I have drunk with them? You must've been dreaming no, I remember clearly clearly? Remember the color of the wine? Colorless I see experts say anything in dream is colorless those taiwanese must've drugged our food when I was unconscious, he embraced me took me home, then lightly put me in bed then he switched on the record player and broadcast Mozart's 8 major then he poured champagne in candlelight while I was lying there defenseless the storm outside greeted the torrid scene indoors that was only your illusion, auntie more or less a female has good esp didn't you discover that taiwanese fancies me?

Then you vomited and it stank so I had to take off your clothing you changed for me? Yes I may not know how to please a girl but I respect her I know nothing about sexual relationship but I know such a relationship is mutual and it is made only after lawful marriage seems changing clothes is high treason besides, I switched off the light did you do it in darkness? I lit the lighter so you saw everything nothing what? I didn't see anything even if I did, it was nothing now you owe me a big favor tell me the positions of the missiles in Taiwan what? Tell me about the deployment of missiles in Taiwan I don't know it, and it's not a deal tell me about the secret of chiang ching-kuo's death then there's no secret about it he died of diabetes and everybody knows it you really didn't do anything last night?

What do you say? Let me take you to he chief's room is it safe? We have different safety standards the room is now vacant but the police will rent it for the time being raise your head and see the surroundings are a bit complex you'd better post some men up above and men on each floor too a group over there and one group above here a group on the rooftop too, I think the building opposite may be a bit high, but it's better to post one man on each floor down below should be packed with people this is safer. Why fuss? The only way out for safety can this be arranged? We went through the crooked route before after 40 years of the national foundation, we've made remarkable progress sports for instance, political movements excluded we won three championships in girl's volley ball the zero breakthrough of hsu hai-feng chu chien-hua's world record in high jump girls swimming team breaking out of Asia Michael Chang winning the French open champions Michael Chang?

That chen li flew from Peking to Shanghai railed from Shanghai to hangchow, flew from hangchow to canton then sailed from canton to Hong Kong why so many different means of travel? To keep it a secret is he coming today or tomorrow? Not today, not tomorrow, but day after tomorrow morning or afternoon? Noon, to see his old flame a male or a female? A female of course, she's pai su-Cheng pai su-Cheng? Never heard of her I've only heard of brandts essence of chicken pai su-Cheng is her name, an ex-queen of nan Kai university because her father is a kuomintang member she hasn't seen chien li for half a century the killer is a taiwanese, now in Hong Kong our men are investigating and will tell you once we have news it's now crucial to stop chien li from surfacing it's better to believe it than not can't we have him put off his trip? How strange hk and Taiwan brethren are more concerned about the motherland's leaders than we mainland people this has hitherto been the case we prayed only 3 minutes on the death of the hk governor it anything happens to a Chinese leader we hk people have to pray for ourselves yes, if chien were killed by taiwanese the mainland had an excuse to invade Taiwan and Taiwan can't hold its own don't worry. Even a killer won't kill a powerless old tennis fun chien li doesn't deserve death these years killing has become irrational the attempts on Reagan, the pope, John Lennon, Elvis... Elvis wasn't killed yes, he was kill by prestley isn't beardsley a soccer star? He's a footballer no, he's kgb why should a kmb employee kill Elvis? Kgb is the Soviet secret police secret police playing football? No Elvis is still alive still alive?
