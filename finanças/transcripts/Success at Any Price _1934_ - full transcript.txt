That funeral got me thinking, Sarah. I was fond of Mike. He was dumb but .. There wasn't much harm in him. They say the bullet got his one good eye. He was staggering around the streets. Just a blind gunman. Then they plugged him full of holes. It don't do much good to think about it. Sure it does. It shows what kind of a world this is. He had gold cupids on his coffin. Ten grand it cost. That's what Mike got. But I'm going to get something different. I'll get what Mike was after only I'm going to get mine respectable. The gold and silver I'm after ain't going to be on my coffin. You got to be patient. You got to wait. It's a cinch for you to talk. You're sitting pretty. You're a swell secretary getting $32.50 a week. You're sitting on top of the world. That's not on top of the world. It is from where I'm looking. You mustn't be jealous about my making money. I feel that it's for us. For our future. We dream a lot about the future but it don't get us no nearer. But you want it to, don't you Joe? I've said it enough times. Know what you will do tomorrow? - You tell me. Jump in the river? - No. You're coming to the office with me to see Mr Merritt. He's been awfully nice to me. I'll see him first. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we worked in the same office together? Yeah. I would be just as wonderful as taking a trip to the moon. I have a feeling about it. I think he's going to give you a job. I'll meet you in the morning. We'll go down together. Alright. Goodnight. Someday it will be different, Sarah. Someday we'll be married. We'll be together all the time. Goodnight. Just a minute please. I'll patch you in to Mr Halliburton. Main American Company. Mr Merritt can't speak to you right now. He's in conference. Excuse me. Has Joe Martin returned from lunch yet? I haven't seen him, Mr Fisher. That boy takes too long for lunch. Mr Martin. Mr Fisher has been asking for you. He says you take too long for lunch. Why not tell him to boil his head for a cabbage. You won't last here very long if you're as fresh as that. I'm thinking of quitting anyway. A month in this dump is plenty. Sarah. I got a great idea. - What? I'm going to quit. This place don't suit me. There's nothing in it for me. I don't get along in this genteel racket. What are you going to do next? Have you any plans? Will you be as confused as you are now? - I ain't confused. The people here don't like me and I don't like them either. It's alright for the classy college kids like Merritt's fraternity brothers. They drag down a lot of money. For what? Sitting around offices swilling liquor and telling dirty stories. That's business. It's a racket. If that's the way you feel .. Why not tell Mr Merritt to his face instead of talking behind his back? I get no chance to see his face or his back. But if I do, I'll tell him things that will make his hair curl. There he is now. Why don't you tell him for me? You say a lot of wild things. But you don't mean half of it. I think I close the deal with Hatfield this afternoon. He is due here at 3 o'clock. Two million. That's right. That gives him a half interest. He'll have a ball. - I know. But it puts us right on top of the heap. Yes. Expansion. No limit to it. I'll go over the legal details with you later. Get the memo of the agreement with Hatfield. Here it is. I thought you'd need it. Always one step ahead of me. Wait a minute. I've been on a regular merry-go-round here. I need a little relaxation. What are you doing tonight? - Nothing. Don't you think it would be pleasant to take a drive and forget about business? No. I've been expecting this. Are you a mind-reader? - You are easy. I can tell by the way a man looks at me. Besides, you raised my salary. Then again, you've never even touched me or held my hand. Which alone is so unusual it makes a girl suspicious. Still one step ahead of me. You must give me credit. I don't do this sort of thing often. Yes you do. I am your secretary. I ought to know. Well, my interest in women is just nervousness. Then don't get nervous with me. Alright. But I can't help being sorry you're a good woman as well as a good secretary. Every time I come in here Mr Merritt is tied up. I'm tied up too. I can't do a thing until he okays my copy. I never have a chance to get near him. He's sent for this stuff. Can I go in? - I'll see. Say, Martin. Those statistics you sent me on cosmetics are all wrong. You'd better be more careful or I'll complain about you. Go ahead and complain. I don't like the tone of your voice. - There's plenty about you I don't like. Mr Merritt. Those papers are here from the statistical department. Yes, sir. He'll ring for you. Who is in there? - Mr Hatfield. Hatfield? I hear Hatfield is going to take an active interest around here. As a matter of fact, I understand there will be some big changes. [ Buzzer ] You can go in now, Joe. You know, I don't know whether I should be telling you this or not. But Hatfield may have been talking. He says to me, He says .. 'Joe'. 'I think we ought to throw these college punks out'. 'And get some real men working in this dump'. Mr Hatfield, our merchandising service is entirely dependent on two sciences. In the first place, industrial analysis of sales appeal. Buying power. Density of market. In the second place, psychology. Knowledge of people's whims, desires, phobias. What do you want? - You sent for these. Oh, yes. Where is Fisher? I want him to explain these charts. I can show you anything you want. Your people are particularly interested in our plans for expansion in the west. This is what you want I think. Oh yes. Why isn't there a short summary of this material? There is. These filing cards. I worked them out myself. Oh. There you are. What's your name, young man? Martin. Joe Martin. Yes. Well that will do, Martin. I think this will be all you'll need. I'll take these with me and examine them at my leisure. I just had a break. One of the richest guys in America just asked me what my name was. You don't seem very blown up about it. - Joe. I'm busy. You are? Yes, I am. - What do you think of that? Out of my way. - Why? Joe, I have work to do. - Go ahead. Alright. Go on. - Please. I want to help you. - Joe. I have papers to sort. - Go ahead. Now please. Oh Joe. Joe, Joe, Joe. I'll be gone some hours, Miss Griswold. I have an important conference. Yes, Mr Merritt. I'm on to that guy. Does he ever do anything but gab and drink? He's terribly busy. You heard him say he was going to a conference. A conference? Blond or brunette? What was it you said you wanted? Money. Money, money. Charming. You are so nice and subtle about it. I am too nice to be subtle and you know it. I don't know how to be coy. Besides, you wouldn't like me if I were. If I'm not satisfactory you can kick me off the payroll. You're just a poor little thing who seems unable to make both ends meet .. On a thousand a month. - I'm sorry, Ray. I do my best. My bank account always seems to be overdrawn. You're a fool to be so generous. Don't be so morbid. I'll take care of it. I always will. As long as you limit your affections. It is undignified. Why don't you make it nicer, Ray? Why don't you marry me? You have no soul. Neither have you, you old codfish. That's why we are so well suited. You don't love me. I might learn if I had leisure enough to concentrate. And really set my mind to it. Comfort and security. I always figured I would marry somebody rich and dull and kind. I see. And I am just the type. Thanks. What is the good of chasing after something that does not exist? Aren't there any romantic people in the world? Sometimes I think I would like something quite different. Something mad and wonderful. A really exciting man who would sweep me off my feet. Try Spain. Why don't you find some young kid if that's what you want? I don't like them young. Is that so? You won't make a dream daddy out of me. I advertise all the preparations that go to make you wonderful. So, you admit I am. You do pretty well with yourself. You're apt to drive men crazy. That is, if they're a little cracked to start with. I am still sane. Let's go on as we are. It may not be perfect but it is awfully cozy. Mr Halliburton is waiting to discuss the Glamour Cream copy with Mr Merritt. I told him I'd call him. Hey, Sarah. It's after five. How soon can you beat it? I don't know. I'm waiting for Mr Merritt. Just saw a new dame on the switchboard. What's the matter, are you fired? No. I'm working for Mr Halliburton now. He's worse. He is terrible. He uses awful big words. And he gets mad because I can't spell them. I thought he would jump down my throat because I couldn't spell meretricious. Why don't you use your sex appeal? The next time he balls you out just jump on his lap and rumple his hair. That's Miss Griswold's system. Look how well she's getting on. - Oh, shut up Joe. Gee, you are fresh. Did you mean that, Joe? Are you really jealous about me and Mr Merritt? He's been awfully decent to me and I respect him. Go on. Let him have you. I know what's what, you know. That's what it amounts to. He's soft on you and you're eating it up in a big way. Go on. I don't blame you. Maybe he'll raise you two bucks a week. I can't stand you going on like this. You hurt me. It seems you like to hurt me. No. I don't mean to hurt you. We've got to protect each other. It means our future together. There's no future without money. And I have just got to have it. I've been waiting for a break ever since I was born. This Glamour Cream copy has to go out to 17 magazines tonight. What am I to do with it? - Use your own judgement. That's enough out of you. You're an assistant clerk here. You must learn to be civil to members of staff. I'll not take any guff from you. - Joe. In that case I'll have you thrown out. You dirty little college shrimp. I could shake the stuffings out of you. What's this? This isn't Madison Square Garden. What's the idea? I just wanted to see the sawdust fly. - Get out. Okay. I'm on my way. You and your high-hat fraternity chums are all the same to me, Mr Merritt. You don't want anyone in the office with brains enough to stand on his own feet. You got a lot of saps here who don't know their business. All they know is to get down and pray every time you look at them. I don't like the place or the way it's run and I don't think much of you. That's enough from you. You're fired. Thanks. It's a pleasure. Come in my office. Well done, Mr Merritt. I wouldn't be so cocky. I imagine it's your fault as much as his. I liked his nerve. Will you okay the Glamour Cream copy now? No woman will plow through all those words. It's too crowded. It won't fit on the page. I'll try it again. I'll sweat blood to get this right. Your blood won't sell Glamour Cream any more than your stupid copy will. I'll do it myself. Did you ring, Mr Merritt? - We must work tonight, Miss Griswold. New copy for the Glamour Cream campaign. You're not fair. I am so fair that I am giving you another chance. Why not go and get drunk? It may make you forget you're a bright young man. Alright, sir. I'm afraid that boy is a sap. Yes, sir. That's the way Joe Martin felt. Your friend? He is a raving lunatic. No he isn't. He's smart. He's ambitious. And he feels everyone is against him. He's had a lot of hard knocks and he is bitter about it. He wants to get ahead. I can't figure out what you see in him. You don't know him. There is a side to him that other people don't see. He is .. He's got a lot of imagination and he's sensitive. He pretends to be tough because things hurt him and he doesn't want to be hurt. Well. For your sake I'll take another look at this very sensitive young man. I'm going downstairs to get a rub down. Tell him he can see me there. Thank you, Mr Merritt. Well, come on. Speak up. What have you to say for yourself? Well. I was dead wrong in losing my temper. And. In a way, I am sorry. Of course, what I said was true but I was a fool to say it. To admit one is a fool is the beginning of success. If you're going to give me a success talk I suppose I must listen. Wait a minute. Don't get hot. Keep your shirt on and tell me what's wrong. Everybody in that dump is afraid of you. And you stand up there trying to kid us along. I'm as good as you are and it makes me sore. You're a square peg in a round hole, huh? If that's dirty crack it's way over my head. Have you read any of our copy? - Yeah. All of it. I went through all that stuff in the files. For the last two years. What do you think of it? Rotten. Could you do better? - If I couldn't I'd jump out a window. Suppose you found yourself in a congenial job. With a good future ahead of you. - I'd take it. Very nice of you. Know anything about Glamour Cream? Yeah. I know all about it. It looks like putty and sells for fourteen bucks a jar. They put it on at night. It penetrates the pores of the skin. Works while they sleep. Sounds like something for bedbugs. Made from the glandular fluid of real alligators. I've seen them myself. I wouldn't lay that on too thick in the copy. No dame likes to look like an alligator. I'm going to call your bluff right now, Martin. You think you can write copy. Between now and 8 o'clock you write the copy for our most important new client. If you get away with it you're hired at fifty a week. This is the stuff? - Yes. That's it. Give me the dictionary. He told me to rewrite the copy and get it ready for 8 o'clock tonight. I can hardly believe it. I'm so glad. You see. You were wrong about him. Don't be a fool. I haven't changed my mind about him. He's only giving me this chance because he's mushy on you. I don't care. There's only one thing that counts. Getting the cash. Hot money. There's plenty of it laying around if you know how to get your hands on it. I'm worried about you, Joe. You're so bitter. You're so anxious for money. Go on. Write me a letter about it. I sometimes wonder if you love me at all. Cut it out. There's a time for everything. Oh. Excuse me. I thought Miss Griswold was here. Get out. I thought you were fired. Get out. Well. You could knock me over with a feather. Why? - Joe Martin. In there sitting at the boss's desk. Running his fingers through his hair. I couldn't be more surprised if I'd seen a kangaroo sitting there. Is Mr Merritt in? No. But I think he's coming back. Thanks. I will wait. I would like to be in her shoes. I don't see what's so funny about it. My eyes are pretty near as big as hers. It isn't her eyes, baby. Oh. I thought I smelled perfume. I am sorry. To interrupt anyone who looks so busy. That's alright. Thank you. Do you happen to know where Mr Merritt is? He might be in any one of 40,000 places. Really? Why not? He knows a lot of places. May I wait? Can I stop you? Would you mind telling me who you are? That's hard to tell. Sometimes I'm me and sometimes I am twelve other guys. You say such odd things. I ain't such a socialite. Miss Carter. Oh. You know who I am. You think there's anyone is the office who doesn't know who you are? I hadn't thought of that. What is your job here? I am sort-of a combination office boy, statistician and boot-black. You want a shine? You are very amusing. - Same to you. Anyway, I'm glad of the chance to have had a whiff of that stuff. So you like me? I don't know. I ain't had time to dislike you. That lavender water sure gets my nanny. Take a good whiff. What do you call it? Parfum D'Amour Do you use it all over you? Well, not exactly. I use other things. I can just see you in a hot bath of this amour stuff. That is indecent. Yes? I've heard worse. Tell me worse. I've been sitting here trying to think up catchwords for the luxury trade. Trying to sell cream to dolls that rub it on themselves. Suddenly I look up and you're standing there. I mean. Glamour. This beauty they get for fourteen bucks a pot. You're a part of that. It's the stuff that makes poets go cuckoo. Go on. You are cuckoo yourself. You don't know what I'm talking about. You are .. you're not so much. But you look like you stepped out of a little pot of gold. When I see you I see the whole game. You're too dumb to get the idea. I'm dumb am I? Yes. You are just a pink piece of fluff for the luxury trade. You know, I could use you. What for? Just to crack the whip over you. Because you are so wild. Because you want to punch people and call them names and walk over them. I could teach you a few things. And if I wanted to. I could make you jump through hoops. You want to try? I'm joking. Give me my handkerchief. No. I want it. I need it. If I had a million dollars. I would buy you. You wouldn't get me. Want to bet? Our sales went up a hundred thousand on the strength of that. That's nothing to what we're going to do. Next time I'm planning something new. This layout I want on a double-page spread. In the eight leading class magazines. - Mr Merritt. What is it, Jeffrey? I think you should include a swan. A swan? Oh, a swan? Forget it. Look. This thing, even as it is now. Isn't right. Not as I see it. The clothes on this girl should be much thinner. This man should be standing over here looking at her. With his eyes shining. You know. That's up to the art department. Look. I'll furnish the ideas. All you boys with a college education have to do .. Is to take those ideas and put them into fancy words. That's enough, Marie. - The yellow gown tonight? I don't care. I don't care what I wear or where I go. You know, Marie. I don't like men. But I'm not the kind that gets any real comfort out of a good book. So what? That's Mr Merritt now. I don't care what she's doing. I must talk to her. You can't go in now, Mr Martin. I can't see you now. I have a date. Besides, I told you not to come here anymore. I don't always do as I'm told. I am dressing. I can see you are. Let me talk to you for just a minute anyway. I told you I didn't want to see you anymore and I meant it. You and I don't get along together. Every time we see each other it's a free-for-all. I haven't got any time for romantic kids. It's just a joke to me. I don't want to be bothered. That's the kind of a cold potato I am. That is what you say. But you don't mean that. You'll change. When do you get that million dollars you're always talking about? Sooner than you think. You wait. One of these days I'll bring you stuff. Jewels the size of an egg. Stones that will make you sweat to carry them on a hot day. It sounds pretty. But it's all talk. I'll give you the world. As a present. Maybe not the whole world at once. But in time .. - I know how you feel. Anything you cannot get makes you sick and sour. I know how it is looking in shop windows. Now go away. I'll get my arms around you once. I'll never let you go. Don't. Don't. Don't do that. Now get out. You'll change. You just give me time. I'll make you change. Well, Joe. I had no idea your devotion to my interests was so far reaching. I think he's the saddest boy in the world. He is all twisted and funny. He wants to be a great man. And he wants to be sweet. I'll turn my back and count to three. While you get the rest of the staff out of here. Don't be funny, Ray. I don't want him around but he won't let me alone. He bothers the life out of me. He's after me all the time. Dear little Agnes. Don't be hard-hearted. Lay off, Ray. When I stop being straight with you, you'll know it. I'll let you know it. That's very charming of you. After all, direct information is the most reliable. Murray Motors up ten and three quarters. Buy or sell? Nine and seven eighths? A block of ten thousand? What about Primary Drug Products? Yes. Union Motors. 38 and a half? I'll tell him. The market is not so good. A lot of jackasses thought we hit bottom last fall. I knew better. You know everything, don't you. - Not quite. Excuse me. How do you spell 'unique'? With a 'K'. U .. N .. I .. K. Thanks a lot. That's the way I had it but it looked funny. Goodbye. Where is the boss? - Mr Merritt hasn't come down yet. Don't be so formal. Haven't you time to talk to an old friend? After all, we are still friends? - I don't know. You've changed so. Both of us. Getting along. Rags to riches, huh? I don't know about the riches. The salary I get ain't so much. It's the market that counts. It's those sweet words I read on that tape. I'm not taking any of their dumb tips. I'm selling short and making money. Say. Remember the first time I got a job in this place? It was the day after my brother's funeral. I haven't been down on the east side since .. Well, it's more than a year. It seems a million miles away. Good morning. Do you want to see me, Joe? Yeah. Just for a minute. Have you broken the news to Halliburton yet? No. I will .. I'll talk to him right now. Send Halliburton to my office. Yes, sir. I closed with the Kruger paint people today. One year. They promised to spend $200,00 on a household varnish campaign. That's great, Joe. I'm glad somebody has $200,000 to spend. You want me, Mr Merritt? I hear you're having a big bang-up society wedding next week. I feel pretty bad that you didn't invite me. Don't keep me in suspense. I am sorry, Jeff. You are through. I have been expecting it. I get married next week and hoped .. - You see, my boy. My hand is forced. It's been a pretty bad year. And the bankers are not satisfied with our overhead. I don't want to sit around being charged to overhead. Let me know if there is anything I can do for you. Good luck. The same to you. Get me Mr Morton of Bryant & Goldberg. I want to speak to Ned Bottomley of Bottomley Gower and Gates. Hello, Morton. What's the latest? I don't care how much I'm short. I'm going to keep on selling. You can't go wrong at these prices. I've got inside information there is going to be a rise any day. People who think they can sell America short are crazy. Listen I want to be short a thousand shares by the end of the day. Sure it will end by dropping. I studied the charts. When the black lines start going down it takes more than optimism to stop them. From Mr Fisher's office. You forgot these, Miss McCabe. Thank you. Dinah. How do you like working for Fisher? Any complaints? I used to have that job myself. He is wonderful, Mr Martin. Mr Fisher is just lovely to me. Miss McCabe is a very charming girl, Mr Martin. She belongs definitely in the 'plus' group. Very willing. She's been a great help to me. Really. Sounds like you got a regular love nest in there. Mr Martin. It's nothing like that. Nothing of the kind. But I wish it were. Dinah, I congratulate you. At last you're working for a man who's willing to do wrong by you. Mr Martin. You don't suppose I would have said he was lovely to me if .. If he'd tried anything like that. You never can tell. A man's better nature should overbalance his lower instincts. He wants to marry me. That's great then. You see, Mr Martin. Out of 750 people under the age of 28. 77.2% are either married or have definite expectations. 22.8% are mothers. Of course the females are mothers. But not all. Oh dear. I have work to do. Get me Mr Hatfield. Yes. I want to talk to Hatfield himself. About my proposition. You gave it any thought? I've given it much thought but one must have some regard for the ethical side. Thanks. Frankly, I don't get this stuff about ethics. A moment please. - Excuse me. Do you think it's loyal to come to me behind Merritt's back to talk about him? I ain't got time for loyalty. Merritt pays me a salary and he gets full value for it. But if you leave him in charge of the firm we'll be bankrupt in a year. But if I follow your suggestion we may lose Merritt. If we do we, can stand it. But he won't quit. He lost every dime he's got in the market. He'll have to hang on. Listen, Mr Hatfield. Will you please leave Merritt to me? Come on. Come on. Why don't you tell me the truth? Does Merritt give you money whenever you ask for it? It's none of your business. - I'm making it my business. You're nothing in my life, Joe. You never will be. Why do you go out with me? Because it is very flattering for me to have a young man to go out with me. Besides. You are much nicer than you used to be. Your manners have improved. How about Merritt? Don't ask me questions. And don't act as if you own me. I can paddle my own canoe. Isn't there any place in your canoe for me? I should say not. You're the kind that rocks the boat. Does Merritt give you money or don't he? Wouldn't you like to know. It's a simple question. All you got to do is answer me yes or no. You handle all the checks. You must know if she gets money each month or not. Answer me. Does she still get his money? - What a fool you are. With all your brains and your feelings you're all tied up in knots. You can't see anything straight. You mean she's still friends with Merritt? Let go of me. It's nothing to me. I'm not helping you. I don't care if you live or die. I hate you. Hello. I hope I don't interrupt a t?te-?-t?te. Come in my office, Aggie. I want to talk to you. No thanks. I didn't come to see you. I came to see Raymond. What is the matter with him? Miss Carter, Mr Merritt. He'll see you in a minute. Did you ever used this Glamour Cream they advertise so much? Yes. I tried a jar once. It is lovely. Yes. I have used them all. I suppose I am afraid of getting old. How could anyone ever think of you as being old, Miss Carter? You mean, where there is no thought there's no wrinkles? Don't kid me, Miss Griswold. I know your opinion of me. I never even bothered to have an opinion of you. What is your opinion of Joe Martin? I can't help it if he makes a fuss over me. But I don't take him seriously. To me, he's just the comic relief. How can he feel for you the way he does? You're such a fool is what you are. How can he love you? Well, I am glad you said what you thought. I didn't mean to. You can go in now. Look, Joe. The dawn. Yes. The old sun comes up when it's ready whether you like it or not. I guess you'd tell the sun to stand still if you could. Hey, you're almost home. Do I have to leave you now? Come up to breakfast. If you promise not to be sappy. Thanks. Listen, Aggie. You got to decide to do one thing or the other. You promised not to be sappy. You want breakfast? No. Then come and watch me have mine. You made a bet with me once. You haven't forgotten it, have you? A million. I'm about to take you up on it. You haven't got it, Joe. I don't believe you. Yep. Want to see my bank book? If what I have were in quarters and dimes. I could build a pile as high as the Empire State Building. Alright. Pile up your dimes and quarters. I don't want them. You might as well live up to the bargain. The bet is off, Joe. Forget it. You don't mean that. I've waited a long time for you, Aggie. You got a heart, haven't you? Why don't you listen to your heart? You got a tear in your eye right now. I know it. Want a handkerchief? I got one. See? It's yours. What a fool you are. What a fool. But I must say you don't keep it very nicely. No. No. But it is perfumed. I kept putting that D'Amour stuff on it. For three years I've been true to you. To my dream of you. Don't, Joe. Don't. I'll build a house so big you won't be able to find your way around in it. I'll make it legal. Suppose we get married right away? Why do you want to marry me, Joe? I'm no good. I like you. But I'm wise enough to know that .. All this poetry about love and romance doesn't mean anything. You just want me because I am hard to get. There is no sense in you marrying a girl like me. Supposing I want to marry you? Supposing I want to give you things. And take care of you and make you happy. Not for just a month or a year. Don't say no, Aggie. I think it is just too funny. The girls in the department had hysterics when I showed it to them. Excuse me, Miss Griswold. I guess I shouldn't have talked to you about it. You used to be sweet on him yourself, didn't you? Yeah. Well, you should have had your hair blonding. It may have made all the difference. - I'm afraid you're right, Dinah. Know what Myrtle said? I don't care what Myrtle said. It doesn't concern us in the least. I don't know why not. Miss Carter has been a member of the firm ever since I can remember. Have you the Pickmans contract, Miss Griswold? Yes, sir. Here it is. What is the matter with you? Hydrophobia? No, sir. Something just struck me funny. What's so funny about that? You ought to know, Mr Merritt. - Don't be an imbecile, Miss McCabe. I am sorry, Mr Merritt. Please don't fire me. I just love it here. I've been here 8 years. Mr Fisher and I are always here first in the morning. Even since we were married. - Well, you're not being fired. But you will be if you keep on talking. Will you come in my office please, Miss Griswold. Yes, sir. Will you go over to 5th Avenue and get a wedding present for Mr and Mrs Martin. Something under five hundred dollars. Write an appropriate card and charge it to me. Yes, sir. It's amusing, isn't it. You know. I think you and I should celebrate. Celebrate? I've watched you. You are unhappy. Nothing is worth taking too seriously. I don't understand it. Really I don't. Everybody seems to think love is just a way of passing the time. That's just New York. Maybe .. Maybe you and I should protect each other. Against getting really hurt some time. Please don't, Mr Merritt. Alright. Had you any sort of gift in mind? Well. What about a nice little bomb made of TNT and scrap iron? No. Anything you like. Something big and impressive. One of those big silver things with a lot of carving on it. You know. One of those items you put in the dining room and nobody knows what it's for. I had a good laugh today. What? I just got an inside tip that .. Welburgh & Hays are going into receivership. Who are they? A year ago they were our biggest competitors. Now they're sunk. What a scream. Mr Martin was very particular about the nursery on the south side. I don't know what he wants it for. - Well. The usual thing. But this nursery is big enough for ten children. Isn't it, Mr Crawford? It is Mr Martin's idea. We'll make it into a billiard room. You can have a lot more fun with billiards. How about it, Aggie? I couldn't wait to find out what you thought about it. You needn't stay, Mr Crawford. We'll talk it over and let you know. Thanks. Mrs Martin wants a few changes. I'll see you about it at the office. - Thanks. Goodbye. You mean to say you bought all this land without asking me? No. I just took an option on it. We drive out Saturday to look at it. Am I to be buried in a house that looks like Grant's tomb? 30 miles from nowhere. It's not 30 miles from nowhere. It's right on the water. I don't like water. Am I supposed to raise an old-fashioned family? Can't you see me with a sweet-faced brat on each knee? I like New York. I like noise and parties. I would die anywhere else. Sure. All the thoughts in your empty head are jazz and noise. You are what you are. And I can't change you. After careful analysis. I am convinced that .. The only way to increase sales .. And to meet the competition. Is by a drastic cut in prices. I'm sorry. I didn't get that straight. What's the matter with you? I've kind-of got a headache, Mr Martin. Aren't there any girls in this office who can work without complaining? It is after midnight now. My brain just won't stand it, Mr Martin. After all, I am only a girl. Not a .. Gyroscope. A what? Those people who work like machinery. You know what I mean. Go on home. I didn't know how tired you were. I'm a slave driver I guess. I work like a horse myself and expect everybody else to do the same thing. If you'll excuse me for saying so, Mr Martin. I don't know how you do it. Sometimes I think you'll just explode like a firecracker. Maybe I will. Goodnight, Dinah. How do you do, Miss McCabe. How do you do. Excuse me, sir. But I thought maybe you'd gone. I was just going. - Mr Martin. If it's not asking too much of you. Can I have a jar of that glamour cream? Sure. What for? You want to make yourself beautiful? - No. No. I've never found anything so good to polish the doorknobs with. Sure. Help yourself. The place is full of them in there. Goodnight. - Thank you, sir. Goodnight, sir. Joe. Joe. Joe, Joe. Wake up. Wake up, Joe. Joe, I had the most marvelous time tonight. You want me to tell you about it? - No. You might be more polite about it. - Polite? Is this a time to be polite when I must get up at seven o'clock in the morning? Alright for you. You're never more than half-awake until four in the afternoon. Then you start on the cocktails. There was the moist amusing man there tonight. You want me to tell you about him? - No. He was a foreigner. He talked broken English. You good-for-nothing little cheat. I'm not. I don't know. I wake up in the middle of the night and there you are sitting there. Tight. Your eyes shining. Your hair all crazy. I suppose you've been out picking daisies. Anyway, I woke you up. And made you jealous. If I catch you running around with anyone else I'll show you. What do you care? You never go out with me. You don't care what I do. I'll find out. Maybe I'll get a couple of detectives to follow you around. You needn't bother. I haven't done anything. You just watch your step. That's all. I haven't done anything. But maybe I will. I try to be good but what's the use? I sent for you Merritt because I've been thinking things over. Thinking a lot of things over. Do you know I can make three times as much money if I ran the business alone. What do you expect me to do? What do you suppose? You are quitting. You are crazy. You'll do as I tell you and like it. You can't fight me. You lost your shirt in the market. And got money from the bank on personal notes. And I bought the notes. You'll take what I give you and be glad to get it. This is the rottenest thing you've ever pulled. Sure it's rotten. Business is not a Sunday school picnic, you know. I'm not in this for my health. I'll give you one week to clear up your affairs and get out. Is that clear? Perfectly clear. Will you get all my private papers from the files. Right from the beginning. From 1922. I'll sort them over and keep what I want. Why? Well. I am fired. How? The usual way. One week's notice. Please don't be sorry for me. I'll get some money out of it and make another connection. Start over again. It is peculiar. At a time like this you instinctively turn to somebody that you .. You have a lot of respect for. I wonder if I could persuade you to marry me. I suppose I should be grateful but .. I think it's funny. Well. I think we both need each other. I am sure I need you. I want companionship. Somebody close to me that I can trust. We may not be desperately in love but .. It is sensible. A solid relationship. Sure and safe. To me, love is something different. It isn't a relationship. It is something .. you die for. For all you know. I may be dying of it now. Yes? Miss Griswold would like to see you. Send her in. Hello, Sarah. What can I do for you? Joe. I'm resigning. Huh? I don't want to work here anymore. Why? Aren't you happy? Aren't you satisfied? I gave you an office all to yourself. You handle some of our biggest accounts. A rising salary. A hundred a week is a lot of money these days. You have been generous. I don't want to stay here. I don't like it. You don't like me? You don't want to work for me? No. I'm tired. I want to go away. Your feelings are hurt about Merritt. My kicking him out. That's just one of the things you've done. I don't want you to quit, Sarah. You are the only friend I've got around here. The only one I trust. Come on. I need you here. Go on back to your office. I won't hear another word from you. Understand? Go on back. Mr Martin, could we speak to you for just a moment please? Come on in. Make it snappy. Well, what's on your mind? I prefer for my wife to tell you, Mr Martin. Come on. Out with it. I am quitting work, Mr Martin. Say, what's going on around here? Old man Fisher struck oil or something? You tell him, Harry. She is expectant, Mr Martin. Oh. What I expect is a baby. That's probably what you'll get. Name him after me and I'll start him off with a savings account. Well. I sort-of thought that I'd name him after his father. That's natural, isn't it, Mr Martin? Yeah. It's so natural it don't need any comment. I'm surprised and pleased that the two of you can create a child between you. That is something to be proud of. It does seem wonderful. Does it? As wonderful as that, huh? The two of you are really happy, are you? Oh, more than that. More than happy. That's great. I envy you. You can have your job back this time, Dinah. But don't make a habit of it. Oh. Thank you, Mr Martin. We were scared to tell you but I knew you'd be a prince about it. Only last Thursday I talked to Harry .. She means, thank you, Mr Martin. That's all. Come. This man says he knows you. I'll say he does. Send him in. - Yes, sir. Come in, Mr Halliburton. How are you, Mr Martin? Glad to see you, Halliburton. Sit down. This is like old times. No it isn't. It's very different. I hesitated about coming to see you. You must be selling something then. What is it, an encyclopedia or novelty cigarette cases? Not quite that. I handle bonds for Jones & MacIntyre. You're married, aren't you? How big a family you got? Two kids. We're out in Forest Hills. All you can do for your family is pound the pavements selling rotten securities. Why should I feel sorry for you? You have all the cards stacked in your favor. A college education. A lot of rich friends. Don't rub it in. I'll be going. You don't have to worry about feeling sorry for me. I'm a happy man. What do you mean, happy? We've been broke and desperate a couple of times. But we know how to laugh it off. My wife is a good sport. The kids are great. You don't have to pity me. Thanks for a couple of minutes of your valuable time. Wait a minute. What's your hurry? I'll make a proposition to you. How would you like to go into the statistical department? As Fisher's assistant. Fifty a week. When can I begin? Right now. You go into Fisher's office and tell him it's okay. Thanks. I'll never forget this. Some people are happy. Did you say something, Mr Martin? No. No. I didn't say anything. Our operations in the past have been very satisfactory. There's no reason why this deal shouldn't prove even more successful. Sure. We'll work well together. We keep our mouths shut. We don't worry about ethics and we get results. I'll keep you informed of every move tomorrow. My brokers will begin dumping the stock at the opening. At the same time their credit is frozen and the tickers carry the usual rumors. And we have Union Motors in our pocket for about one tenth of what it's worth. I need hardly suggest absolute secrecy. Don't worry. As long as we're making money I'll stick by you. Give my regards to Mrs Martin. She looked charming the other evening. At the Club D'Orsay. Yes. She's crazy about those hotspots. I wouldn't be found dead in one myself. I admire you, Martin. You're a dynamo. A fountain of energy. But. Try and get a little pleasure. A little relaxation. I don't go for those things. I'm out for something bigger. Power. Money is power. I'll contact you in the morning. - Right. Goodbye. [ Buzzer ] Yeah? Mr Ryan is waiting to see you. Oh. Tell him to come in. Hello, Ryan. I've been waiting for you. You got the report? Here it is. Every move she made last week. You're a busy man, Mr Martin. Why not read this over, think about it and phone me my instructions. No. Wait. Is this straight? You hired me to get the facts. There are the facts. Hatfield? Hatfield. Yeah. Up at his apartment. I bribed one of the servants and had a man in there on Tuesday. So that's what she's been up to. Hatfield. Making it up, am I? Take a squint at this. That doesn't prove anything. Don't argue about facts. I called you down here to tell you a few things. A long time ago I knew something was going on. Now I can prove it. Alright. What will you do about it? - Plenty. You thought you can make an ape out of me. But you can't do it. It's your own fault. You never trusted me. You never even really bothered to know me. I know you. You're made out of perfume and whipped cream. You haven't any heart. You've a little pile of broken glass where your heart ought to be. You make up things about me. You have every part of me in a card index. Haven't you? The wax face. The jewels. But that's not me. You're too selfish to see the real me. I am looking right through you. - Don't do that. You're hurting me. - Am I? Let me go. I'd like to kill you just to see you squirm. But you're not worth killing. [ Buzzer ] Yes? Mr Hatfield to see you. Send him in. What's the trouble? Nothing much. You can almost say, hardly anything at all. For a minute, I wanted to kill my wife. But I suppose that's an old-fashioned idea. I don't follow you. - Yes you do. That's the whole story. You do follow me. Don't look so upset. You were the one telling me to relax. Now I give you something to relax about. Don't listen to him. You'll listen to me. And you too. I sent for both of you to give you an earful. We three have tangled up together too long. I'm through with both of you. Let's make an end of it. Let's throw all our loves and hates right in the ash-can and start over. Today, I send all our private papers and accounts to the district attorney. About how we got hold of Union Motors and all the rest of it. So. You are breaking faith. Go on. Give me a lecture about faith and honor and ethics. How does wife stealing fit in? How about the tricks you and me played on the market? You and me are just a couple of gangsters. We cleaned up on Wall Street with tricks that would make a gunman blush. There's no ethics in this town. It's kill or be killed. Grab what you can. You've got my wife and you can have her. When I get through with you, you won't be rubbed with Glamour Cream. Not this time. It will be mud. And plenty of it. Both of your names will be spread all over the papers. You and your money and your banks. You will lose all of them. And you'll get my wife in exchange. Now get out. - He's mad. You're making a mistake. - Get out! Let's go somewhere and get a good, stiff drink. We need it. [ Buzzer ] Don't bother me. I don't want to see anyone. Joe. Joe. I've come to tell you that .. What's the matter with you? You mean this? What about it? Why don't you shoot me? It would save me a lot of trouble. I am in the dark. In a fog. Thinking a lot of crazy thoughts. Asking myself questions there is no answer to. The only answer is this. Why? Did you decide this suddenly? No. No. It isn't so sudden. For a long time I've wondered. The only thing that has kept me here is money. I'm tied down with bags of it. What good has it done you? Nothing. Just a lot of dreams. That turn into nightmares before I could touch them. I dreamed about estates and yachts. I wanted a dump on Long Island. Blocks of grass that stretched right out to the sea. I wanted children playing on the lawn. Splashing about in a great big marble tank. I'll never have those brats. I'll never have anything I really want. Has it ever occurred to you that what happened has been your own fault? Why have you cheated everybody that's come near you? Why have you lied and twisted and hurt people to satisfy your crazy pride? I suppose you're right. It has been my fault. If I'd had any sense things would have been different. I came to tell you I'm leaving for good. Sarah. Look at me. From the minute I turned my back on you, everything went wrong. You wouldn't give me another chance? You've no right to ask. - I have been blind. You've been near me and I haven't seen you. Forgive me. Answer me from your heart. Answer me. Has it ever changed? You are so romantic you can't see anything the way it really is. For years you've hardly spoken a word to me. Now you expect me to believe you're dying of grief over me. It's ridiculous. People aren't like that. You don't know anything about people. I don't blame you, Sarah. I know it's hard for you to understand. And it's hard to believe me after the way I've acted. I wanted to see myself a great man. A man that leads armies. A king with a crown. I forgot everything else. I realize now much I've hurt people. Crushed them. I want to start over now, Sarah. I want to pick up with you where we left off. Because without you I wouldn't be able to .. [ Gunshot! ] He must be kept very quiet until we get him to the hospital. Sarah. I am here, Joe. I want to live. Don't leave me. Of course you're going to live. I won't leave you. I'll never leave you. ..r-o-s..
