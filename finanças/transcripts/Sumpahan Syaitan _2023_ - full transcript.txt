- Mr. Harun! - Hi, Mr. Malik! - How are you? - I am good and blessed! I have looked inside and out. But... why is the price so low? - Why is it so low? - Yes. Well, I suppose you are just lucky. After all, I am thinking about changing my line of business. Oh, okay. Well, I have looked inside and out. I am definitely feeling the vibe of this place. I'm liking the vibe. I love it! I feel, Harun, like if we just do some minor renovations... Mr. Malik, we have similar thoughts. I believe I have found the right person. Mr. Harun, no need to say more. Prepare all the documents. I am going to buy this hotel. Are you cool with that? Don't worry, Mr. Malik. I will get the documents ready as soon as possible. Do not buy this hotel! If you buy it, you will die! Do not buy this hotel! Go away! - Who was that person? - He's just a crazy guy. He usually sleeps around this hotel area. He's worried that if this hotel is sold, he will no longer have a place to sleep. That is normal. There will always be insane people in an empty area. See you at the lawyer's office, okay? I'll see you at the lawyer's office. Gotta change the hotel ownership title immediately before anything bad happens. FOR SALE ORIGINAL STORY, CONCEPT, AND DIRECTION BY ROY - Do you all aspire to be rich? - Yes. - Do you all aspire to greatness? - Yes. Then you must have faith in yourselves and in me. You are nobody if you are not rich! You have to be rich to be successful! COME ON! JOIN OUR BUSINESS! YOU'LL LOSE OUT IF YOU DON'T TRY! That is the reason why it's extremely important for all of you to take part in this program. I want all of us to get rich and be successful together. We want the people we love to be happy! So, we can call it a success. Right? - So, can you? - We can! - I'm not hearing you! - We can! Okay. So, today... Today, we will join together and go through the entire program so that I can nurture you guys to become millionaires. - Who wants to be successful? - Me. - Who wants to be successful? - Me! The presence of a future millionaire. Okay, don't worry, I will get my partner to bring you guys out so that you can discuss it with him. - Can you? - We can! - Who wants to be rich? - Me! - Can you? - We can! Good. Have a seat, Mr. Sam. If you become a millionaire, anything is possible. These are the people I will help become the next millionaires. Now, I can sense a millionaire aura from you, Mr. Sam. But... Mr. Sam! To be a proactive and productive millionaire, we have to throw the "but" mentality! Meaning? It means that to be successful, there should not be any excuses or obstacles that can hinder goals to succeed. Most importantly, and I cannot stress this enough, you must believe and have faith in, and listen to the words of, already successful people like... Lee Chong Wei? That kind of person? Mr. Sam, he is a national champion. He has nothing to do with this. I am talking about individuals like me. You get that, right? If you notice, the people I mentored and helped and made millionaires used to just have a scooter. They are now riding superbikes. They used to be squatters. Now they own bungalows. Previously, they rented and now they are the landlords. For all you know, one day, every Malaysian could own can own their own assets and have financial freedom. So imagine this. Three million, and in less than a year, you would have made 30 million! Gosh, you will be super rich, Mr. Sam! Super rich! I could be. I am confident in my ability to succeed. If you are looking for a hotel, a car, or a house, please look for me and I can assist. Just keep in mind, 30%. But for the time being, I'm thinking a lot. What exactly are you thinking, Sam? I'm thinking about how I can get money to invest. I believe this business has a lot of potential. Just imagine. In less than a year, you will be making more than 200%. I am confident we will make a profit and not lose. And within that time, I will repay your money, and you'll also have a profit. The issue is not the profit, Sam. If I resell the hotel, I will get less than the market price. Below two million. So... I really won't be able to help you. It is not necessary to sell the hotel. Sam, you are my best friend. I've known you for years, not just a day or two! I couldn't help you even if I wanted to. Are you for real? That much profit in less than a year? Are you really sure about this? I am extremely sure! I have done my due diligence. I have studied everything about this investment. I can help you. Are you serious about helping me? Yes. But not me. Branco. John! Don't you go looking for trouble! Don't introduce him to Branco! Don't go looking for trouble! Damn! Look at you... You don't actually think I'm trying to outdo you, do you? If he is one of your investors, allow me to meet him. I aspire to be rich like you as well. Come on! Tell me. Who is this Branco? Do you know? They can give you the amount you need. But you must make your payments on time. Hey, it's me, Sam. I'm always on time. Both of you are asking for trouble. Do not forget my tips. 30%. Deal? It's me. Sam. I will make them my aide. Good. Very good! Come. It is dangerous here. Please, Branco. I promise I will pay your money. Please, give me a little more time. Please, do not kill me, Branco. This man is wasting our time, Boss. If you say the word, I will kill him. You have had your time. After all, you have signed. You have now broken your promise and attempted to flee. The punishment is death. Have mercy, Branco! I have a family. Just give me a little more time. I won't run away again, Branco! Please, Branco! Find his family. It would be a shame to let them starve. We cannot let them go hungry. Bury the whole family in one grave. At least they won't be lonely. Follow me. Yes, yes, yes. Let us follow him. What brought you here, exactly? My friend wishes to borrow some money. I don't want to know what you want. How much do you need? Three million. Sure. But remember. If you fail to pay on time, you will face the same consequences as that man you just saw. Understand? Do you agree? Tell him that you agree, and you will pay him back later. Agreed. Good. I just accompanied him. You have to sign as well. Why do I have to sign? As a guarantor. As a guarantor? You brought him here. You are also accountable. Hey, I just accompanied him. Okay. I will sign this. I will sign. Shoot, he says. Remember. If you both want to live your lives, simply pay what has been agreed upon. If you do not, you will be... Understand? All right. We will excuse ourselves. There will be success where there is effort. Isn't that right? - Sam what? "Sampoi." - Sampoi! Yeah! When will I become a millionaire? A face like yours can be a millionaire too. Everyone can be a millionaire. But before becoming a millionaire, you must...? Start building your downline. Absolutely, you must first build your downline. Our future millionaire is smart. Anyway, I appreciate all of your support in my business. Mr. Ray, John, and Malik. And even more so, my beautiful, loving wife. Thank you. This is our millionaire of the future's character. Even though he's a tall, strong tree, he never forgets the grass on the ground. - Right? - That is so right. You can forget the others, but not your wife. Otherwise, I will chop down your tree. How could you even say that, honey? You are the only one in my heart. Anyway, Malik, I really do need your support. Sorry, Sam. I have to head to London for a bit. I need to manage my other hotel branches. For how long? I will be leaving in two or three days. I will be staying there for a month. Nevertheless, for your launch ceremony, I will still be around to attend. This is exactly what true friends are for. They will always make time for you. Do not forget me. I am also your true friend. Who are the future millionaires? Us! Who are the future millionaires? All of us! Good. I will be getting 30%. Okay, I will take care of all the VIPs for the party tomorrow night. I will be there tomorrow evening. Is this your car, Ray? Amazing. This is a limited-edition type. If you want to know, there are only 50 in the whole world. But it's okay! We'll complete the launch first. Based on Mr. Sam's serious demeanor, who knows? Mr. Sam might one day own this car. If God wills it, you will have it soon. I will go first now, okay? - Who wants to be a millionaire? - I do! - I want to be a millionaire. - I do! - Yes. - You have it. - Who are the millionaires? - We are the millionaires! - Yes, yes, millionaires! - We are millionaires! His car is so stunning. Wow! Hi, welcome. Hi. Welcome. Hi, Aunty! Aunt, welcome. How do you do? - Hi. Congratulations. - The number you called cannot be reached. - Please try again later. - Welcome. You finally made it! With this kind of suit and so on. You used to wear shorts and singlets before! Don't panic. The place is full. Why the sour face? You are just starting. I have been trying to call Ray since last night, but I have been unsuccessful. Damn. Please, come in. Hey, how are you? Call his alternate phone numbers or acquittances to see if you can get through. - Please, call him. - With all of these people? - Hi. - Just call. Call him. Sir. Hey, have you seen Ray or not? That's the problem! I'm trying to find him, but he's gone! Forget calling. I think he is a scammer. Yes, a scammer. Damn it, Sam. I've advised you many times, Sam. Research properly before dealing. It has come to this, and the hall is full. What are you going to do? There are lots of people here! - Please, sit. - Hi. This is what we'll do. I want your family and you to meet me at the hotel. Understood? - This includes you too! - Why I am included? This is all because of you. - It is not because of me! - Listen! Meet me at the hotel. You figure this out. I'm totally blank. I've warned you guys before! What have you done, Sam? Didn't you think this through? You didn't even advise him to be careful. You just kept on agreeing with everything he said. It's lucky he took Branco's money. What if he'd cheated all those that came today? Are you for real? Talk is easy! Hey! Do you know what type of man Branco is? He will kill you. He will kill your wife and kids. He will kill us all. Do you understand? I never thought he would just disappear like that. I trusted him. How could he have the heart to lie to me? I've always advised you to check thoroughly before making any decision. Do you know what's happening now? You are not merely endangering yourself. You are endangering your family as well. Luckily, Branco did not come tonight. Take a look at how this turned out. I am sorry, honey. I promise... I will do whatever it takes to save our family. Yes. Please, do something. Branco is crazy and evil. Don't you know that? This is because you are my best friend. Listen here! I recently purchased a hotel in Segamat. A hotel that has been abandoned. It is deep and quiet. I want you to bring your family and live quietly there. We have roughly three months. At the same time, I will be heading to London. I will be back in 20 days. I have a business deal to buy and sell hotels there. If... I manage to sell the hotel, I will make a profit of two million. You get me? But then... What should I do with the hotel? You studied hotel management before, right? I've got all the workers there. Don't tell me you want to stay here. When should we go? Just one more thing. The documents for the transfer of ownership are ready. I just don't have the time to go there and sign. So, you go there and sign all the documents using your name. Once we solve all these issues, we will re-sell the hotel under your name. One more thing. I'm sure they have seen your car. You go there using my car. Uncle Abu! Our new boss is very attractive. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too, sir. My name is Sam. I'm the one taking over this hotel now. This is my wife, Rina, and this is my daughter, Angel. Hi, madam! - This is for you, madam. - Thank you. Sir! You startled me! - Look at him trying to suck up to them. - Sir! Sir! My name is Abu, sir. The head of security here. I am an ex-police officer. A friend of Mr. Malik's, sir! I know all the chief-of-polices. Terengganu, Kelantan, Selangor, Johor. Kampuchea. Bangladesh. You name it, I will definitely know. That's enough, Abu! Please introduce us as well. Abu, how many times do we have to tell you not to bring your child to work? Hey! I'm a worker here! A worker! - What did he say? - No. No. Working here. Please accept my apologies, sir! He's naturally like that. - He works as my assistant, sir! - Yes, sir. My name is Muthu. I have one wife and four kids. Abu and myself, we always work together. It's like everyone joins to help together and falls. - It's not "falls"! - What? - It's "follows"! - Oh, follows! Please accept my apologies, sir. My assistant is known for his weird character. Sir, I am the head chef here. Chef Roley 1,9, aka Adam. The kitchen, it's totally my place and not theirs. It's my place! Every single special dish is my forte. Just name it and you shall get it! I will even cook air if you desire that. - This is my kitchen assistant. - Nina. She also acts as an oil barrier for me. She gets the oil first, which explains her bloating. My name is Ramli, the manager. - Manager, speak louder! - Damn it! - Yes, yes... - Yes, sir! Sir! I am Yassin! When it comes to cleaning, sending things... Please, follow me, sir. I will show you around. This is the condition of our hotel, sir. Yassin, please pick up all the luggage. I was just about to introduce myself. You had to ruin it, Abu. Here, is it? Please, madam. Please, ma'am. This is a very nice hotel. Right, honey? Sir. I'm sure you are exhausted. Why don't you take a rest in your room, sir? There's no need to worry, sir! I've taken care of everything. The air-con is cold, sir. While you both rest, we will prepare something special and deliver it to your room. - Yes, yes, yes. - Nina, let us get to work. Okay, boss! Let us make something delicious for our bosses today. Do not forget the suitcases. Take them to the room. - Okay, boss. - Yes, sir! Hey! What are you waiting for? Show the boss his room! Do not get angry, Uncle Abu. Be patient, yeah? Okay? Please follow me, boss. Hey! Where are their suitcases? Hurry up! You can sign them by tomorrow. Can I help you, sir? - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Can I meet with Ms. Liza, the lawyer? - Do you have an appointment? - Yes, I do. Sir, please wait a moment. - Hello, ma'am. A client's here to see you. - It's so beautiful and big. Mr. Sam? Yes. I have been expecting you, Mr. Sam. Please, follow me. Welcome, Mr. Sam. - Mr. Sam, you may sit here. - All right. Please. Mr. Sam. So, Mr. Sam. You will be taking over the hotel, right? Yes, I will. Okay. I have prepared all the documents that Mr. Malik requested. Mr. Sam, you just have to sign these documents and the ownership will be fully transferred to you. You can sign here. Right here, please. It turned on by itself. By itself? That is weird. Perhaps there is an issue with it. Please. Please, Mr. Sam. The payment method? That's fine! I've discussed that with Mr. Malik already. I am hoping that Mr. Sam can run this hotel perfectly. Yes, if God wills it. Mr. Sam, this is my name card. You can contact me if anything comes up related to buying or selling real estate. - Thank you, if God wills it. - You are welcome. Mr. Harun. Just like that? For the hotel deal transaction? The important thing is that the ownership has been changed. My late grandfather asked my father to change it, but till today, he didn't change it. Why? Is there an issue with the hotel? Angel, after this, we need to go to school. Okay, Mom. - Honey! Honey! - Mom! Dad! - What's happening? - Honey! Dad! What is happening? Who are you? Please do not do anything, sir. He is not sane. He is sick. He is always hanging around this hotel. You, go away. Go away. Insane, huh? Insane, huh? Clap, ladybug, clap Grasshopper and butterflies Let's go. Everything okay? Damn! Honey... I am worried. I am not sure if Angel will be happy at her new school. What matters is that I study. Right, Dad? Regardless of where she attends school, she's smart, so you don't have to worry. Hello, Sam. How are you? Okay. I have settled all the documents. The ownership of the hotel has changed. Good. Good. How were the staff? Everything is fine. No worries. Now, I am on my way to enroll my daughter in a nearby school. Sam! I want to remind you not to go out too often. Branco is on the lookout for you. I will be in London for 20 days to settle the hotel business here. I hope I can settle it as fast as possible. Thank you very much, bro. Only God can repay your generosity. Take good care of yourself. Okay. Send my regards to your family. Whose bag is this? Whose bag is this? This... This is a bag... - Whose bag? - I don't know. That is my bag! Oh, sir. We were taken aback. Sir, do you want to check in? My name is Carlos. Oh, Mr. Carlos. Mr. Carlos, can we help you? I want to check in. Check in. The bag arrived ahead of you. This bag belongs to him. It is almost 7:00 p.m.! Hurry! I want a room! Hurry up! Give me the key! Key! Key! - The room! - Please be patient! You need to pay first. - Keep the change! Two months! - Two months? - The room! Where is my room? - Give him the key! Hurry! - Hurry up! Hurry up! - Key! - Give him the key! - Where is the key?! - Where is the key?! - Here's the key. Keep the change. Take it to my room. You! Take it now! - Hurry! - Hurry, quickly! Ouch! - I am so sorry! Sorry. - Oh, you hit me! - Where do you want to go? - To the kitchen! - The kitchen is that way. - The kitchen is there! Where is my kitchen? Who turned the water on? Sir! Sir, this hotel is in good condition. I've taken care of everything, sir! Despite the fact that we've only recently met, you must have faith in me because I am an ex-police officer. Sir, please do not believe the others. None of them can be trusted. Especially that skinny one! All he does is cook, cook, cook, while the assistant, eats, eats, eats! He allows his fat assistant to eat everything. The bellboy is another. Unreliable. He is also a slacker. If anything comes up, please call me. I will be right up front. But, Pak Abu, I have heard otherwise. What? What kind of stories? I will go do my work first, sir. What did they say about me now? Damn! Issue after issue! Madam, madam, madam! Have a seat, have a seat! Sir, I will go to do my work now. Honey. Why the sour face? Honey... Honey... Do not think too much about Branco. No matter what happens... Enough. Stop worrying. Sir. We have a problem, sir. I believe there's a problem with our water tank because customers complained yesterday that the tap water was turning on and off intermittently. Okay, hold on. Tell me, where is the water tank? It's at the back, boss. - Let's go, quickly. - Sure! Honey, please wait for me here. Take a look at the accounts and highlight the relevant items. I will be back shortly! Be careful, honey. Up there. That's the tank up there. This is the main tank? Yes, sir. Praise God, it is nothing serious. I will just prescribe some medicines for the pain. Just one thing, madam. For the time being, no adventurous activities, neither vertical nor horizontal. Horizontal? Vertical? You can't... you know what. Do you get it? Yes, Doctor. I do. It's good if you understand. Not even a little bit, Doctor? Not even close. That's enough, dear. Don't think too much. It's okay. Let's take the medicine. Thank you, Doctor. You're welcome. Honey. Are you okay? But, honey. What I saw was a hand. A hand? Sir, I have figured it out. The cause of the clogged tank. This is it! It was just a glove. How could you be afraid of this? It is okay, Ramli. Just pick up the medicines from the counter. Sure, madam. Please, have a seat. Hey! Salleh, what are you doing? Go clean up over there. - It is always the same spot. - I'm sorry. - Brother Yassin? - Yeah? Brother Yassin, you are extremely firm. That's how it should be. Just mind your own business. Welcome, sir. My name is Bakar, but everyone calls me Burn. I want the largest hotel room in this hotel. - 304! - We have it, sir. Just a moment, sir. - How's this hotel? Is it good? - Yes, it's good. So far, everything is going well, sir. Is everything going well at work? Is there anything wrong? No, sir! So far, no problems, sir. - Everything is good. - That's good. Perform admirably. Please notify me if any problems arise. Understood? Who exactly is he, arrogantly asking so many questions and acting as if he's the boss? One more thing. At precisely two in the morning, please deliver a cup of hot coffee to my room. - Understood? - Yes, sir. - Hurry up! - The audacity to ask for a hot coffee? This is the key, and this is the remote. - Remember, the coffee! - Yes, sir. - Do not forget. - Yes, sir. One, two, three? Okay. I will let it be this time. This is getting out of hand! This is what I hate. - Who is he talking to? - Look here! We have four. One, two, three, four. See? We have four. You go and serve these now. Wow! They smell so good! Can I have one, please? Don't you have any dignity? You have already eaten a lot earlier. Now, you are asking for another one. Stop talking and deliver them now! Ate a lot? Who ate a lot? I have not eaten anything. I was preoccupied with my work. You just want to make a joke with me. You want it, perhaps? Nina is really getting on my nerves. Damn buttonhole! If you want to eat, simply ask! You don't have to steal! 304. 304. 30... Sir. Sir. Sir. What's the deal with the knocking at this hour? I am sorry, sir. This guest requested a cup of coffee, but he did not open the door. Coffee at this hour? Please, respect others. Yes, sir. I am sorry. Sir. Oh, sir! Oh, it is open. Sir? Where is he? Sir? Where is the guest? Sir? Oh, sir? Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Help! Help! Help! Help! What is happening? What's wrong? What's happening? Dead. Dead? Move aside. It is all right. Allow me to check on him. What? Is it wrong? He is dead? He is dead? What's wrong? Positive! He is dead! Dead. Everyone! It is all right. Be silent. Honey, give me the telephone. Who does he wish to contact? Yes, Sam. What is the deal? Malik... a dead body has been found in this hotel. A dead body? Sam, do not joke around! I am not lying. - Do you want me to lodge a police report? - We are going to prison. Sam, you listen here. Do not lodge a police report. Don't do it. It's going to cause chaos and it will make the headlines. Branco will undoubtedly find you. Also, the hotel will not make it if people know someone died there. No one will purchase it, Sam! Sam, listen to me. You just do what I have asked you to, okay? You act like nothing happened. What about the dead body? You... Okay! The body... You bury it behind the hotel, okay? That's the only thing we can do for now. What should I do now? My god, Sam? We'll do this, Sam. Get me Pak Abu! Get me Pak Abu. Pak Abu? Mr. Malik wants to talk to you. - Yes, sir! - Pak Abu. Pak Abu, please remove the body and bury it behind the hotel. Do it because I intend to sell the land. I want to sell the hotel. Can you? Yes, sir! I will do it immediately. Bury it now! - Bury this body! - Why should I? I am just the bellboy. I'm not a grave digger. Ask him! You have that digger look. I can only hold a ladle, not a hoe! Please wait. - Honey. - Yes? Go check on our daughter. Let me solve this first. Okay! If none of you are willing to help bury this body, I will report to the police that all of you people murdered this man! We didn't do anything! I have friends in the police force. Understand? You will all be charged under section 302 of the criminal code in Shah Alam, peace, yo! Okay, okay. Please, do not report us. We will bury it. Together, we are strong. If we divorce, we can marry again later. What nonsense are you babbling about? Lift the body! Come on! Faster! You lift it from there, I will lift it from here. Hey, hey, hey! What's with all that humming? Burying a body requires teamwork. Teamwork my buttonhole! Do you think this is a rhythmic burial? You think this is a joke? Sir! Look at them, sir! They have been playing around since earlier. You said you're an ex-cop. Are you sure that's true? Hey! I am a former policeman! Just bury the body! Pak Abu! Do not make noise! Sir, they were making noise with that lousy chanting! My God! What is wrong with you guys? What's with this chanting? Just bury the body quietly. It is true that we did not kill the person. But we are burying that guy without his consent! If one person gets caught... Adam! Okay, settle down. We will just bury him. Come on, guys, faster! Faster! I'm so confused. I don't know, Yassin. For the past few days, every time I've been about to cook, I've been experiencing a negative vibe. My mind keeps thinking about it. I... don't think I can. You? What about me? When I close my eyes, I see him. I close my eyes and I see his corpse. I was the one who discovered the body. Hey! What are you both doing here? You there! You two are busy chatting in the middle of the walkway. You're like a pair of chopsticks standing here. Relax. Calm down. My room has not been cleaned yet, do you know that? When I saw it last night, everything was a mess! What work are you guys doing? Mr. Carlos, Relax! Try to calm down. - How do you expect me to relax?! - Hey! I am extremely stressed now! Mr. Carlos! Don't ever think that you are the only one stressed out! We are more stressed! Every time the clock hits seven, you get stressed! Every time it hits 7:00 p.m., you get stressed! Huh?! What's your deal, man? Huh? Tell me we want to hear! You buttonhole! Such a chopstick! This is too much for me. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? What is that sound? Who is this boy playing here? You wait there! You dare to play at this hour? Caught you! It's a ghost! Pak Abu! What happened? - The door! - The door? I saw... a ghost! A ghost kid! Ghost kid? Hey! What nonsense are you blabbering about? Are you planning to run away? There is no ghost! Stop playing around. You saw a ghost kid? Ghost kid my head! Muthu! Follow me. Where to? I want to go to the toilet, Muthu. Hey. I feel weird. You discovered the body. They are seeing ghosts. These people are making me so... Damn! I burned my hands! I'm just gonna continue pooping! It is so hot! Pak Abu! Yes, sir? What actually happened last night? Muthu came to me last night. He said, "Abu. I saw a ghost. I am scared, Abu!" Turns out, it was just a reflection of his shadow. He was scared of his own shadow. But do not worry, sir. I have taken care of everything. There is no ghost. Good, Pak Abu. It's true. There are no such things as ghosts. Yes. All right, sir. I want to finish my work here. There is still a lot to be taken care of. - Please excuse me, sir. - All right. Branco, please forgive me. Please! I wasn't running away from you, Branco. Branco, please forgive me. If you can't pay my debts, I can forgive you. But if you run away from me, the punishment is death. I'm sorry, Branco. Sam, the one who borrowed money from us! He did not start his business. He deceived us. And he has gotten away. You have broken your promise. I will find you no matter where you are. Sam! - How many rooms are booked today? - Not that many. Around 25 rooms are booked. Why it is so dark? What is happening? Why it is so dark? Why is the power not on? - We don't know. It's so sudden! - Hey! Who cut the cable? Brothers... What do you mean, who cut the cable? Don't let me cut you now! Cleverly cutting all the cables to sell as metal scrap, huh? - I will steal you and eat you now, okay? - You think I'm a papaya fruit, huh? Hey, you! You said you knew the chief of police? Don't tell me you don't know any electricians. Here goes another useless guy! I was an ex-cop. Why would I know an electrician? Hey. Why is there no electricity? We do not know, sir. Don't we have candles or something? We have candles. Go and get them. Bellboy, go get the candles. Oh God! I am still traumatized. Traumatized! Let's do this. We'll all go! - All go? - It's okay. Everyone, go together and find the candles, and then bring them to my room. Sure thing, sir. Please, hurry. - Yes, sir. - Come on, everyone, hurry up. Come on lets go. Don't split up. I am afraid myself. Nina! Please do not be afraid, okay? Please, look after me, okay? I am just slightly afraid. Uncle, don't be scared. Otherwise, I will get more scared. Hey! Is everyone okay? I'm so dead. Okay, buttonhole. It's already really dark here. Pitch black. I suppose my future is also bleak now. I am just a security guard. Don't tell me this is my job too. Damn it! Brother. Brother. - Who's there? - I am a hotel guest. - Guest?! - Yes! - What are you doing outside here? - It was hot in my room. It's late at night as well, and there's no electricity. What an overrated hotel this is. Don't worry, brother. We will get the electricity soon, including the water soon. Why don't you go back to your room? Here's a candle for you. But it is hot. Thank goodness it was not the ghost. Otherwise, I would have died of shock. Please, do not get upset. Take these candles first for the time being. The power will be restored soon. Do not be afraid. Why did you people leave me alone? Don't you realize I'm still traumatized? Sir. Sir. - Sir. - The door is not locked. You can come in. - Madam. - I am here. - Madam, Where are you? - I don't want to live. - Huh? Madam? - I am guilty! - Do not try to stop me! - Madam! - Please, don't, madam! Don't. - I've murdered my husband. - Please think it over, madam! - I don't want to live. - We can discuss it. - Let me die too. Madam! Why it is so dark here? Help! There's been another death! Help me! Help me! Damn! What is wrong, Yassin? Sir! Sir! I saw it, sir. - What did you see? - I saw! - She killed herself, sir! - What's wrong? Suicide? What's going on here? - What is happening? - She killed herself. Come, let's go and check it out now. You go first... Quickly. Be careful! Yassin. Line them up together. Grab from there! Damn! I'm trying to call Mr. Malik, but it's not getting through. - I am at a loss as to what to do now. - What are we going to do? It's all right! Even if we got through, he'd give me the same instructions. - What else? - What? Bury it again? What are you waiting for? Bury this body! No need to hum that. This time, they all died at the same time. They even requested the largest room. I will not cooperate this time. I am out. If you all refuse to bury this body, I will lodge a report saying you all did it. No. Who said I don't want to? I want to! It is like... - You, stop being annoying right now! - Please be faster. Instead of three bodies, I will bury four, including yours! How will we move these bodies? They are heavy! Now, what? Honey, what is happening here? Are you aware of the number of people who have died here so far? Don't tell me you're going to let this keep happening. Please, I cannot do this anymore. Please, honey. Let us leave this place now. Please, honey. I cannot do this anymore. Please, call Malik. Ask him to come back home right now. Yes, but please be patient. I have called him several times, but he hasn't picked up. Let him call us back. Then we will leave this place. Where is Angel? She is sleeping. Go and be with her. Hello, Sam. Why did you call yesterday? I was a little preoccupied with work. There were more deaths yesterday. This time, it was an entire family. Are you for real? Yes, I am telling the truth. How did you handle it? What else could I possibly do? I just buried them as usual. That's the only thing I could think of. You did not answer my calls. After all, we don't have any other options available. Malik. Please, come back. I can't take this anymore. My wife can't do this anymore. You told us to run the hotel, but every night we've had to handle dead bodies here. Do you know that? Okay, Sam. I am still in London. Give me two days. I will be back to see you. What did he say, honey? He will be coming home in two days. Two days? Honey! Honey, please inform all our staff that we're going to have a meeting now. Sure, honey. Mr. Malik will be back in two days. I want all of us to return to work as usual. Understood? - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Listen carefully. Most importantly, we'll keep this secret between ourselves. Understood? - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. - We! - We! - Promise! - Promise! - We will! - We will! - Follow! - Follow! - Any! - Any! - Instructions! - Instructions! - From you! - From you! - Sir! - Sir! - I coughed! - I coughed! - Down! - Down! Okay. Please, resume your work. - Work. - Okay. Okay. Let us resume our work. Honey. I wonder how Malik came to choose these kinds of workers. They are weird. Honey. You're really making things difficult, Malik. Angel... Angel. Just because of work, I have to see all these ghosts. Hey, Muthu! Don't be afraid. The boss will be back in two days. Easy for you to say! You are an ex-police officer! How many people have you caught? How many thieves have you caught? How many people have you shot? What's wrong with him? Crazy? I am different. I worked in a market. I get terrified just seeing a chicken die. That's a dead person, and you think I would not be afraid? Do not be scared. We, as security guards, must always be brave. Like me, an ex-cop. Listen. Remember what our elders used to say back in the day? We are stronger when we are together. If we are not...? - We go marry someone else! - All you think of is marriage! Give it to me. I want to play too. Okay, take this. - Angel! - Dad. - Who are you playing with? - My friend. But he disappeared the moment you came. Friend...? Dad? Okay, that's enough. Let's go in. Do not play outside on a night like this. Okay, Dad. Rina. Angel! Angel, where did you go? I looked everywhere for you. I just went to play out the front. Sam, where are you, Sam? Branco keeps calling me, Sam! Because of that 30%, I am stuck here, Sam. Oh, where are you, Sam? It would be better if I switched it off so that he stopped calling me. Angel, are you okay? - You two wait here. - Yes, sir. - Ali. - Yes, sir. - You follow me. - Okay, sir. All staff, please gather here. Go in front! - What is the matter? - Come faster. - The boss is calling. - What is the problem here? It could be important! To all of my wonderful employees, I say this. Let go of the past. Let it remain in the past. Yes, sir. - A secret remains a secret. - Yes, sir. - Importantly, watch your words. - Yes, sir. Up! - We! - We! - Promise! - Promise! - We will! - We will! - Keep! - Keep! - The secrets! - The secrets! - Entrusted! - Entrusted! The secret? - Police... - What secrets? - Police? - Why are the police here? No. No there are no secrets. I heard that many have gone missing in this area. We don't know anything about missing people. We are not aware of anything. Why don't you try asking him? He's an ex-cop! Oh, an ex-cop. Where were you posted before? Before, in Kota Kinabalu. Another kilo to reach Brunei. Half a kilo more to reach Terengganu. Last location was at Banggol. There were many more. There are so many, sir. I pick up durian, sir. I am not a policeman. I am a chef. I do not know, sir. I heard something about secrets earlier. What secrets? There is no secret. No secret! We did not do anything out the back. Why did I say that? I want to see out the back. Everyone, follow me! Sir. Pardon us, sir. You can go there, but at least leave one person behind to take care of the counter and handle customers. Who are you? I am the boss here, sir. The boss can wait here. The others, follow me. - Sir! Go away! Sir! - Damn! Let us go there, sir. - Hello, honey. - Hello, honey. Are you facing problems with the police? Yes. It's okay, though. Don't worry. Honey, you just take Angel to school. Let me take care of it here. Okay. Please take care of yourself. Yes. Why did you let him in? He is a police officer. I was unable to stop him. Sir. My name is Chef Roley. I am the head chef here. I cook all the special cuisine. There. There are lots of trees. Durian. Durian trees. The rooms are over there. There is nothing here. I have never been this far this way, sir. This is the first time. There is nothing here. It is not fun, right? Let us go. Sir! There. There is nothing here. That is a fish pond. Just a fish pond. - There are many tom yam fish here. - What are you talking about? It's not "tom yam" fish. It is "toman" fish. Ah, that's it. It is you! This is all because of you. Sir, it is dangerous here. There is a big python here. It has big teeth like this. It has a long tongue, up to half a kilometer long. It will just grab and swallow you. What if we become prisoners? Hey, Boss. What do you have buried down there? I planted this, sir. Groundnuts. Buried what? Where? Down there! Huh? Down? Down where? We are so dead. Sir, there is nothing down there. He planted peanut seeds. Yes. Yes. What? Peanut seeds. - Ali! - Yes, sir. - Dig it up now! - Dig it up? Now, my officers are digging. It would be better to tell me what you buried back there, right? Before I find anything, you had better tell me. If not, you are done. Rina! Rina! Malik. What is all the fuss about? I do not know. The police also came. Damn. Maybe they know about the dead people. Okay, it's okay. You go home first. Let me see what's happening out the back, okay? Okay. If anything comes up, call me. Okay? - Okay. All right. - Sir! What are you two doing here? - Actually... - Enough! Follow me out the back. - Out the back... - Now! Sir, we have dug three holes. One more hole is in the process of being dug. Sir, all three holes are empty. - Empty? - Empty? Octopus? - Not "octopus," "empty." - Oh, empty! Sir, we have dug four holes, but there is nothing there. Sir! There are two suspicious people here. I brought them to meet you. Who is he? I am the owner of this hotel. This hotel has two owners? We are share partners. It's okay. It's like this. We apologize for the inconvenience. We are just doing our job. So, we helped dig the hole. No need to use seeds. Just plant trees. - All officers! - Yes, sir. How can they have disappeared? We have been working with you for a long time. We've worked in all kinds of hotels. But this hotel is different. Scary. Done acting? Are you done acting? What kind of person are you, Sam? When you are in trouble, I help you. Do you know that? What kind of person are you? Gosh, what have I done, Malik? All these, Sam! Look! These empty holes! They are empty! Where are the bodies? You gave me headaches while I was in London, saying people had died in the hotel. And I actually believed you! Actually, all of you were making up stories because you all want to take over this hotel. No, sir. No. I picked you up from the villages and provided work. Understand? - Right, sir. - Understood, sir. Mr. Abu! You used to be a rubber tapper! I gave you this job. - Mr. Abu was a rubber tapper before? - Yassin! - You didn't even complete school! - That is right, sir. I was the one who gave you this job! Apparently, you all conspired to throw me out of my job, just like that? - That's not true, boss! - Brother Malik! What are you talking about? Hey, shut up! Please, shut up. This is my business! Let me take care of it. Understand? Are you looking for the dead bodies? How many times have I told you not to come here?! Hey. Who are you? How do you know about these bodies? Who are you?! I warned all of you that day. But when I told you, you did not believe me. You said I was crazy! Crazy! Hey. Who are you? You'd better tell me before I hit your face. Who are you?! You want to know who I am? You want to know who I am?! I was the manager here! The manager? - Edin. - Boss. Here is the key. Ah, Kwan. My boss. The original owner of this hotel. He was a very good boss. But, unfortunately, he was determined to sell this hotel to a new buyer. The buyer of this hotel said you can still be the manager here. I was very indebted to him. On that same night, as I was coming back from the hotel, I noticed a girl. She was beautiful. She was standing by the forest near the hotel. Without thinking too much, I tried to approach the beautiful woman. I asked her what she was doing alone there. She told me that her grandmother had previously buried gold in the ground at the edge of the forest because she was afraid of the Japanese army. But this place had become a hotel. So, she asked me for help to dig up the ground. If you do not believe me, come with me. Where is it? My grandmother buried the gold at the bottom of this tree. But now it has become a mound. I do not know how to dig. Then I helped her dig the ground. Suddenly, I found a package. When I opened the package, the woman suddenly disappeared. After that... The woman I had met was not a human, but a demon in human disguise. I had made a big mistake. I am back. Edin? No! No! Go away! This has been happening for a long time. These kinds of problems, you can't keep delaying dealing with. I've talked to him so many times, but he just doesn't want to listen. How is the big boss? He is dead. The doctor said he had a heart attack. Why? Well... He did not die because of heart disease. I tried to convince Ah Kwan's son that his father did not die due to a heart attack. But he did not believe me. This was all the demon's doing. Do not talk nonsense! - Do you want to be beaten? - A demon! Get out! I do not want to see you! Go! I do not want to be the victim of the demon. I returned to the hotel and wanted to leave the hotel. When I left, I was very surprised by what I saw in front of my eyes. You freed me from the curse. I was locked up for hundreds of years. Now, you will be my slave. You belong to me! You will not be able to get out of here until you die. This is the time for me to take revenge. Since then, whoever purchases this hotel will almost certainly die. You can be safe from those spirits, but you cannot be safe from the demon's curse! I do not want to stay here. I am scared! Sam, and everyone else... I apologize for misunderstanding you. It's okay. But what should we do? What if we call a shaman? I know this one shaman. Hey! You are the one who knows the shaman. - That does not mean the shaman knows you. - Yes. What am I saying? This shaman is an expert at capturing demons. Abu...? Like Ghost Bus Stop. Not a ghost bus stop. Ghostbusters. Yes, sometimes the tongue gets twisted. What kind of hotel is this? You should just close it down. There are other hotels too. Sorry. We are very sorry. Here! Take it! So sorry, sir! Hey! Who kicked me out of here? How dare you kick me out?! I don't want to go! Whatever happens, happens! Nonsense! Why are we being tortured like this? We have been insulted. Us! Where is Pak Abu? Where is Adam? Muthu! Where is Mr. Abu? He's guarding the front. Go and tell Mr. Abu that when the Shaman arrives, he is to lock the doors and not let anyone in. Okay, yes, sir. Sir, that guy has run away. Why did he run? He heard all of this and he was afraid. It is okay. Muthu, you carry on with your work. Yes, sir. - Ramli. - Yes, sir. Sir, I am here. Next time, jump. I can't see you. Yes, sir. Jump! Ramli, have you asked all of them to leave? I don't want anyone to be in the hotel. Yes, sir. I have ordered everyone to leave. There is only one person who hasn't left yet. - That means there are still people here. - Because he... Sam! No matter what, I want everything to be done tonight. I've invested a lot here! SHAMAN - There's something here. - Huh? There is? What is there? Please come in, Tok. Shaman Tok. Please, Tok. Please. Are you sure this is the Shaman? He looks weird! Who is this? Who are you all? We own the hotel. I see. There is something in this place. Yes, Tok? I want biryani rice. Okay. We can cook it here. No! I want it ordered from outside. Ordered from outside? Where from? Seroja Dangdut. You sure they have it there? I just went there yesterday. Okay. Do you have any other requests? Three grilled chickens. Three roasted chickens? That is a lot. Does that ghost really eat that much? Those are for me. I am hungry. - Huh? - One more thing. What else, Tok? Water to wash my hands and tissues. Okay. All right, Tok. Where is my room? - There, Tok. Over there. - Huh? Hey, what's wrong, Tok? - Can you see me? - Yes, Tok. - Usually, I disappear. - Oh, really? It's okay. Please, Tok. This way. - Can you see me? - Yes, Tok. It's not working. Usually, I will disappear. This clearly shows Tok is lying here. There are all kinds of shamans, right? I don't know who they called here. But I want it settled tonight. Damn, it's a baby demon! Who are you? Hi. I am the shaman's assistant. - You are? - Yes, I am. Why are you sitting in here? The boss forbade me to sit inside. - He told me to sit inside here instead. - Oh, really? Please, take me out. I can hardly breathe in here. - What do I call... - Faster! What should I call you? Just call me "brother." Get out of my way! Such a busybody! Listen here. I want to assign tasks to everyone. You! - You, Ramli. - Come forward. Not you. - You! - Serves you right! - Me? - Yes, you. I don't believe it! - Faster! - Hurry up, Abu. - You! Come here! - Me? - Papaya uncle. - Like father like son. Take this. Give these to them. Listen here. Sprinkled throughout the hotel area... - Let's go... - Wait! If you go together, there will be a third. - Third? - Everyone, split up! - You! Come here! - Me? You! And you! Bring both of them now! Yes, Boss! You! You are the tallest. Go to the highest place here. At exactly 12 o'clock, press this remote. Ah! Don't press it now. I can feel it! - Now? - Yes, now. - No need to yell. I heard you. - Yes. You! You! Wait here. - Do not go anywhere. Got it? - Yes. - Little girl, you wait here, okay? - Okay, Uncle. You! You take me to patrol this area. What is wrong with them? I am just a rubber tapper. Why am I sprinkling these seeds? Will they grow and produce milk? This is not even a rubber tree. I'm sorry, demon. Even if there's no rubber tree, you will do. What is that sound? What is this? You mean this? This is called a room. Oh. Open the door. Open it? Let me enter. - So I can't come in, then? - Wait outside. I don't want to go in even if I can. Well, you can go in yourself, then! Magnificent, shaman! Oh my... Why did he close it? Please, do not harm me. I am just trying to earn a living. It's a huge hotel, but my pay is so little. Can we just be friends? Oh, come on! Please, just ignore me. Ouch! It hurts! Who hit me? It hurts. It hurts! Mommy! It hurts! What is taking the shaman long in there? - Hey, Tok! - It hurts! Looks like you are enjoying it. What's the problem, Tok? It's gout. Oh, gout. Are you all right? I'm okay. What sound is this? Where are you, ghost? Damn this smoke! Get out now! - What room is this? - Room? - You want me to open it? - Open it. - Ghost! - You called me? - Migraine! I'm having a migraine. - You need me to help you? - Migraine. Open it. Open it! - Come here. Hey! - There's a ghost! - What do you mean, "ghost"? Ghost! How many times have I told you not to disturb me at night? Where is the ghost? You guys are noisy. - There! - Where? There! - Not there! There! - Where? - There! - You guys better not be lying. Apparently, he's blind after 7:00 p.m. No wonder after 7:00 p.m., he gets agitated and has to be in his room. Come here. I do not want to watch. Are you near here? I found it! Stupid! He just got a ghostly slap! Let's run away! Tok! Where is this, Tok? Let's close this for now. Why doesn't it want to let me leave? I really want to leave right now. Damn! Have you come in or not? Okay, I will go in. Let's just try. It's okay. It's okay. I can... I entered by mistake. Don't do this to me! Playing with the door again. Damn! You're pushing your luck with this ghost. Oh God, help me! Where did that boy go? I can do this! Please, let me go. I don't care. Whatever happens, happens. I have to be brave. I have to! Please, help me! I didn't know who it was. Tok, I saw a ghost. Where? I saw a ghost earlier. It was pulling the door. - Was it? - I chased it out already. - The ghost tried to go inside. - Did it? - I pulled it back. - Thank you so much, Tok. Thank you. I'm clueless about these things. When I see a ghost, I don't know what to do. - I am really scared. What shall we do now? - Where do you want to go after this? - There, that way. To the storeroom. - There? - There? - Back there. The storeroom. Come here, Tok. I will show you. - After this, do not split up. - Okay, Tok. You just follow me. I've never once come in here. Is it true there's a ghost here? Where did he go? I guess he likes me laughing. What is happening? Afraid of ghosts, huh? You are a shaman! Why are you afraid of the ghosts? - Who are you? - I sell cendol. You sell cendol? - What about your boss? - He sells sugarcane water. Sugar cane water? If you know you are not a shaman, why did you call the ghosts? How dare you? This is the storeroom. We have not come here for a long time. - Is this the door? - Yes, Tok. Hey, what is that? Honey... Please wait here. Let me go and take a look. - Angel, wait with Mom. - Okay, Daddy. Nina, you wait and look after Madam. - Please, be careful. - Okay, boss. - What was that? - Huh? Who was that? That's the crazy man, Tok. He lives here, Tok. - Crazy person, huh? - Yes, Tok. I am afraid of crazy people. I am not afraid of ghosts. Oh. Crazy people. Hey, what's going on here? Who screamed? Who was screaming earlier? Why are you screaming? He's the one screaming here, but he's asking why we did? Hey! I told you to go up there! Do you know the time is now? Squeeze that remote! You, take care of your family in the lobby. - Hey, you! Follow me! - Yes? Okay. Over here, Tok. - Nobody can follow simple orders! - I listened to you, Tok. It's okay, Sam! You do your work. I'll do mine. Oh, damn! Ouch! I thought he liked my laugh, but he did not like it. What is this thing? It is because of you that I got hit! Stupid seeds! Let me just become a rubber tapper then. It hurts. Why did I go out when I was comfortable in the room? Where are you all? Is there no one at this hotel? How could I get stuck in this hotel? People asked me to leave, but I didn't want to leave. - Follow behind! - Yes, I am following you, Tok. - Hard! - Hard? Of course it's hard. It's called wood for a reason. - Let's go back. - Huh? - Go back? - Yes! Muthu! Muthu, I am hurt. - The ghost hit my face. - Did it? This place has really got ghosts, Muthu. The ghost of a boy could not possibly hit you. - It was not a boy ghost! - Huh? It was a big bald ghost hitting my face, Muthu! Oh my God! That means there is more than one ghost here. What are we going to do now, Abu? For now, the shaman said we had to split up. You go this way, I go that way. What if the ghost hits me? Do not be scared. What if you borrowed money from loan sharks? Where would you be hiding? Oh, you have already borrowed and run away from them. No, it's hypothetical! If you had done it, then where would you hide? That's easy! If you want to hide, just cover your face like this. Yes, just do that. Then the ghosts won't be able to hit you. Hey, Muthu! Do not bring this with you! - Why not? - You don't want it to hit you! This thing is useless! The important thing is that all these issues are resolved. What time is it? Please, don't hit me a second time. Once was enough. Even that hurt like crazy. - Muthu! - Hah! You think you can change your voice? I won't fall for your trap. Well, you go and experience it then. Too bad for you, Muthu. I tried to warn you. Even my parents didn't beat me up like this. Stupid ghosts! Abu! Where are you? That's why, Tok! I have only been working here for two weeks. I've seen so much weird stuff already. A lot of people have died after being attacked by ghosts. Luckily, you are here. If not, none of us would know what to do. Run! Hey! Wait for me! - Help me! - Hey! What song did I sing earlier? It is 12 o'clock. Finally, it will be over. Ouch! Oh God! Please, Madam, don't do anything to me! Honey. Sir! We saw a ghost. He is not a shaman. He sells cendol. Sir, it hurts. I was hit four times by the ghost, sir. It hurts! That is correct, sir. That's not your typical ghost! That is a tiger ghost! It slapped until there were no tears left. Hey, what's the deal with all the noise here? What are you doing here? I asked you to work! Why aren't you guys working? The ghost hit us, sir. The shaman is a fake. Run! I do not want this. I don't want this. I almost got raped by the ghost! Stupid shithead! The ghost wanted to rape me! That shaman is a fake. The ghost wasn't shaken by the shaman. Look here. Where is the shaman? There is a ghost here! This place is haunted! This place is haunted by demons. I'm not really a shaman. This place is haunted! There are ghosts here! Kenit! Let's go home. - There are real ghosts here! - Liars! You're both liars! - Oh my... - Malik. I can't do this, Malik. I need to get my family out of here. You can try to sort this out. I am so sorry. Where are you going? You cannot leave this place! Honey! I will not let you leave this place! If you challenge me and leave, I will kill this woman! - Mom! - Sam! - Honey! - Don't cry, Angel! - Mom! - Honey, please wake up! Harun! You knew the hotel was haunted, and yet you sold it to me? Mr. Malik, let's sit and discuss this. It's like this. Actually, the hotel has so many issues. But my late grandfather had already bought the hotel, and he refused to listen to others. In the end, he died in that hotel too. I sold it to you for cheap. Half the market price. - That's a good price! - Harun! I do not care about the discount. My friend and his family are now trapped there! It is pointless to talk right now. Now, let us think about how to save them. Here's how it goes, Mr. Malik. I know this one shaman. I believe he can help us. Another shaman? Shaman! Mr. Harun, the shaman ran away from the hotel yesterday because he was chased by a ghost. Is there any other way? Here it is, Mr. Malik. This one is different. A different type of shaman. He is from the paranormal team. He has solved numerous cases in the past. Mr. Malik, I think he can help us. Okay, fine, then. Where we can find him? I will bring him tonight. This place was cursed many years ago by a demon. This is where it was worshipped! The ancient people worshipped it. They sacrificed humans to it every full moon. A silent retaliation took place and they betrayed the demon. They then stopped worshipping it and locked it away for eternity here. This is why, whenever there's a full moon, the hotel owner will be sacrificed to the demon. All the previous owners have been killed. A total of seven people. And tonight, it will kill its eighth victim. Honey, please. What are we going to do? This was not something I expected to happen. That's enough, Malik. I don't want anything happening to my family. I want to leave this place now. - Wait! Sam! - Hurry up! Let's leave, darling. You can't run away from this place. Don't you even dare try. Because the next victim... will not be you, but you! - Boss! - Honey! - Why me? - What is he talking about, darling? Because you are the owner of this place! Sir! If you leave, they will all be dead. If you want to save them, then you will need to sacrifice yourself. But if there's a full moon tonight at 12, the demon will rise to kill you. I can only pray for you all to be safe from the demon. I warned you to never sell this place! Bring all the stuff. Honey, we can't leave you alone here. There should be another way! O Allah, please help all of us. Twenty minutes until the clock strikes twelve. The moon will be full. What does it mean, sir? Malik! I want you to take my family out of here. Leave me here. I appreciate all of your efforts to help me and my family, but all of you need to go. I have to accept my fate. - Honey, what are you talking about? - What is this, Sam? We are like a family. We should be together. - Yes! - We should always be together. - True! - True! What is that? What is that sound? What is that sound? - It's here! The demon is here! - Who closed the door? We can't do anything now. Leave me alone. We have no time. Get out of here. Be patient! Let Muthu and Yassin handle it. Do not be afraid. Go and open the door! Help him! Yassin! Are you okay? Please forgive me, Sam. Hah! He is the main reason for all this! He is the MLM scammer. I got scammed by this man! Every single penny is with him! I want my money back. I already got MYR 2 million from this kid. I want my last one million back. But since I came here myself, I will need more. I came here looking for you. But... If you do not have the money... It's okay, I understand. But you need to sign this letter. What letter is this? I checked with the land office and the lawyer. This hotel belongs to you. And this letter will change the hotel's ownership. After this, this hotel will be mine! It is not that I do not want to sign, but this place is haunted. Sir, just sign the letter. Sign it. Branco! Sam, just sign the letter. Sign it. Ghosts? Even ghosts are terrified of me. I am Branco. More devilish than the devil himself! Are you out of your mind? This blind guy wants to die. Why you are making so much noise here? Have you any idea who I am? Who are you? Why aren't you looking at me? Where are you? I am Carlos. Come here! Where are you? I am right here. I'm here! Sorry, sir. He's blind after 7:00 p.m. - No such thing! - These guys here are thugs! - Where is that guy? - Enough, Sam. Just sign the letter. - I'm getting mad here. - Sit over here, Mr. Branco. Sign it, Sam. This hotel is now my property! It is mine! I will give you all three minutes to pack your stuff and leave. - Please take care of our belongings. - Yes. - Hurry up! Hurry! - Get all the bags now, hurry up! Hurry! Come on! Please, hurry. Sir, we've got everything. Leave this hotel before I shoot you all. Leave! Hey, wait! You still have to pay me interest for one year. Only if you are still alive by then. What? Only if we are still alive by then. He's just blabbering. That's enough! Stop wasting time. Everyone, get out now! Come. Wait for me. Get out! Who is that? Come out now! Come out! Who is that? I said show yourself! All of you! Go find him! Let's get out of here now. Pak Abu, who are all these people? Relax. Just walk. They are the ones who checked in earlier. Sir. Sir. Whose bag is this? - Whose bag is that? - Hold on. This is the bag that I gave to the scammer the other day. - Open it and show it to me! - Okay, sir. - Money... - That is my money! That's Branco. How did he escape? How is he even outside here? Wasn't he inside earlier? You have all lied to me! I will never let you go! You are all dead! Please don't, Branco! Please, don't! - No! No! - What is happening? The ghosts disappeared! - Come! - Faster! - Faster! - Come! This demon is really bad. Come! Faster! A YEAR LATER... Mr. Harun. My name is Roy. I am interested in your place. If you want to sell, I am willing to buy your place. I am sorry, sir. It's not that I don't want to sell this place, but... this hotel has so many issues. Issues? I know exactly what the problem is. I am interested if you are willing to sell it to me. If you are aware and still want to buy it, then I don't see any problem in selling. One more thing. I would like to take a look inside. Please. But I am not going inside. You go. I know you are here. If you want to know who I am, show yourself. I have been waiting for a long time to meet you. Do you want to know who I am? I am the heir of the people who brought you here. THE END
