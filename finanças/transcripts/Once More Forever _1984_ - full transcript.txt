Infinite Universe. If you go through different time limits, you can find many worlds there. It's a story about a journey, that people still don't know about. This story is about a one-year memory of one girl, who caught a glimpse of these worlds. My name is Nega. Why are you talking so pompously? It hurts! -What are they? -It's antelopes. -They're always running. -I want to ride it. Hold its horns! -Who are there? -They are fairy creatures. There are also elves on the other side. Wow! Great clothes! It's not hot. Why? -What is it now? -It's the memory of Feather Star. Feather Star? Everyone knows it, and nobody knows it. At the same time, it's really close and really far. It's what we call Feather Star. I want to make a wish. Come here. Hello earthling! Welcome on-board of the Feather Star. I'm here. -I have to thank you. -Thank me? I didn't do anything. You showed me the way. We've met in the big dream storm. It's embarrassing to talk about it, but I lost my way to Feather Star. That time you helped me out. It's weird. I helped you, but I don't know Feather Star. Before being born, everyone knows it. When you were born our familiar spirit, put her finger in your mouth. She said not to tell anybody. Look! The hollow on your lips is the mark of her finger. You don't have a hollow, right? -I can recall much more than you. -Wonderful things? I'm so sorry! Did it hurt? -Nope. -Let me talk to you more. Time is already up. The rest you can do by yourself. Yuu! Yuu! Yuu! I'll give you the power. You can use this power for one year as you wish, but it's a secret to everyone. Yuu. What are you doing here? Are you really asking me why I'm here? -Look, the ship is leaving. -The ship? Did you see a dream? I saw a dream, but it wasn't a dream. I'll leave two advisers with you. Yuu. On the last day of the year, we will meet again. Yes. Are you kidding me? I also want to go with you! We'll go in one year. Again? Bye-bye! Bye-bye! I'm sorry. When someone special enters your life, it's always unexpected. You may have the chance to change your life with me. My name is Tachibana Shingo, I run Parthenon Production company. Let's agree! Let's start! You'll be on TV. What? It's just so sudden. It's weird. It's not. I'm serious. All right! Let's go! -Mami! -Wait! Just like that Yuu, who had powers, started to be known as Creamy Mami. But it was just the beginning of a tragedy. What do you mean? What? I mean Toshio. Yuu! Where did she go? Hello. What are you doing here? -I want to-- -Calm down. I'm looking for a girl. Your girlfriend? -No way! -But... -Is she pretty? -No, not at all. Okay then. I'm sorry! I need to go. Wait. Will we meet again? When you get along with this girl, we'll definitely meet. Bye-bye! I don't understand him at all! Yeah, I agree. Yuu! Why did you go so far? -I was looking for you! -You're late! Why? I came here to pick you up. If I'm late, Mom will be angry. It's your fault. Don't tell me I'm wrong. You said you had seen Creamy Mami. What do you think about her? Nothing special. I don't know. Anyway, it's cool. I met her today. Look, it's so nice you came here to pick me up. Yeah, I think so. Why is he talking only about Mami? She's me. What do you think Mami said? I'm in a bad mood! I'll skip this. Many things just happened. We were waiting for this evening for a long time. -Yuu! -Toshio! Yuu. Everyone is waiting. Yuu. -Are you okay? -I didn't know! Yuu. I came here to pick you up. I thought you could be here. -Let's go home. -I can't. I won't tell anyone that you're Mami. That's why there's no need to worry. Let's go home. I can't become Yuu again. If someone sees you, it's the end. Really? How long are we going to be here? Until Pino Pino comes back, we'll be here. It's obvious. Did he say it? He came. There is nothing. It's a hallucination. Nope. I can hear it. It's my fault. I saw you. -It's no one's fault. -I shouldn't have seen it. Toshio! Aren't you happy? I'll always be the girl you like. Isn't it great? -I wonder if it's better for you. -Yuu. I'm glad I could meet you. I'm going to Tachibana's place. If you go there, what am I going to tell your parents? The ship. What's that? Yuu! What's going on? Hi! Did you notice it? -It talks. -You still don't understand it, right? Yuu, what's going on? Are you okay? I'm sleepy. They told me what happened. I'm sorry you said it was a secret. The main problem is if you see it by mistake or not, but I can't do anything about it. There's only one person who can do it. I can only make one of your wishes come true. My wish? When you saw Yuu, you took her power, but originally it's not your power, that's why I can only hear one of your wishes. Which one would you choose? What do you want? Maybe something about your future? -I can do everything you want. -Mami. Please, let Mami become Yuu again. Okay. Yuu! Toshio! I changed into Yuu! Toshio. -Didn't you have another wish? -It's okay. I can't become Mami again. It doesn't matter. It's just a couple of years. Let's go. You thought it was the end, right? Yeah. These are crystal trees, right? They are so beautiful! The moon! -It's okay! Hurry up! -Yes, but-- What are you thinking about, Yuu! It's here! I did it! Yuu! I'm going! We started to do Mami's job again. We all did it well. One year sounds like a long period, but it was so short. Debut concert? Finally, we could get a concert hall. Where will it be held? The contract costs one million dollars. It'll be performed in Hong Kong. Hong Kong? Maybe it'll be held in the Queen Elizabeth Stadium? Right! It'll be the first news that the singer Creamy Mami, who's going out into the world, will have a concert in a new stadium. Isn't it the best place to perform a concert? But it's a foreign country... It takes like four hours to get there. It's really close, right? Anyway, we don't have time! You'll have a lot to do, Kidokoro. Don't scare me! When? 1st of July. -We don't even have one month? -We don't. -Manager! -So, do you have a passport? If you don't, we should get one immediately. Prepare your certificate of residence and a family register. What were you thinking? Mami can't get a passport. How's it going there? We need a bit more time. Wait. -It came out! -Just as I expected. What do you mean? Listen. According to our calculation, the one-year deal, between you and Pino Pino will end on 31th of June at 5:45 a.m. On 1st of July you won't be able to use magic. You can't go to the concert. You have to cancel it. Right. Unfortunately, you don't have a choice. I'll do it. What did you say? I really want to do it perfectly. I understand your feelings, but what about magic? It'll be great if we perform the concert in June in Japan. Do you think Tachibana will change his plan? He won't, right? I got it. I don't have any choice. You already made a decision. Don't give up on Creamy Mami. -But you said you understood. -You're just tired. It's better to rest half a year. We'll postpone your debut concert in Hong Kong and perform a concert as planned. -Sleep on it, okay? -But-- Think about it. We can't cancel the concert in Hong Kong. One more thing. You really didn't know about a weekly magazine, right? -Yes. -You should have talked to me. -I'm so sorry. -Just go home and rest. Good night. -Is it okay here? -Absolutely. -Cheer up! -You too, Kidokoro. Bye! What? Was Mami kidnapped? Hello. Mori, is that you? I got it. I'm coming. What's the demand of a criminal? It's criminal! Kidnapping. Mami. What the-- I took Mami out, but we had to use the toilet. Forgive me, please. Journalists were so annoying. I can't understand the situation. It's all started when I predicted the future of Mami. -Mami's future? -Yes. She is a really strange star. I also didn't see any future at all. That's why I thought she was going to quit. Did you talk about it with anyone? The person who leaked information about Mami quitting was my friend. I'm sorry, we cause trouble over and over again. No, no. It's okay. Why are you here? According to my prediction, Mami is confused now. As her fan, if I had powers, I'd be in rush to help her. As a Mami fan, I'm also worried and want to help. Are you her fan? Yes, I became her fan. It'll take time to get her reputation back. Did you get a concert hall? On 29th of June. Wait, please. 29th of June, the concert hall, what does it all mean? We'll perform Mami's debut concert in Japan in June. It was Mami's wish, right? That's why I want to make this wish come true. It's absurd to do it like that. Don't worry. I'll pay for the financial loss, when you cancel the concert in Hong Kong. Where will we get a concert hall? Will you just make another grand event to be cancelled? If you do it, everyone will look coldly at Parthenon Production. We won't do it. We'll perform the concert in the place where no one plans to do it. Where? At the Central Hippodrome. Tachibana, I want this concert be perfect. We'll do our best for that. I totally understand. Okay, let's do it. Yes. The Central Hippodrome. I was given the magical compact there. It's my destiny place. That day my life changed. The debut concert of Creamy Mami. I'm getting closer to my final performance. At this important moment Toshio... Yuu. Yuu. It's enough. If Toshio recalls that moment, my magic will be gone, right? Yeah. I wonder if it's like that. If his memory comes back, Pino Pino can't do anything. When Pino Pino erases the memory, he spends his powers. Really? -Why are you always asking me why? -I am not doing it always! -Why don't you get it, Poji! -Stop it, you two. It doesn't mean that Toshio still remembers it. There's not much time until the final performance. We'll work it out! If you can't do anything, what are we going to do? Nega! These difficult days just passed so quickly. All these days I was avoiding Toshio. The concert is already tomorrow. Tomorrow everything will be finished. Let's hope it stops raining. Don't worry, Yuu. It was said that this kind of wind will stop rain. I hope you're right, Mamoru. Yuu! I have to do my homework after the concert. I have to go home quickly. Yuu! Does she hate me? Yuu is weird. She's being weird. It looks like there's nothing expect this concert for her. The concert? Mami's concert? It's really weird, right? Toshio! Midori! I don't know what happened that day. Is it cause of that day? Huh? What are you talking about? Can I tell? Sure! Tell it! -Toshio thought Mami is an angel. -Right. But, to be honest, Yuu was an angel, right? I suppose it's just your opinion. Toshio, she's an angel, that's why you have to take care of her! Mami is just a celebrity. After all, she's out of my league. Even if it's raining, there are so many customers. Okay, here it is with strawberry jam. Yuu told me the rain would stop. -Here's blueberry jam. Thank you. -By the way, where is she? -Dad! -Give them crepes. Is it the father of Yoshi? It's unusual to see him here. -There's also Makoto! -Hello! Yuu, look! -Where's Toshio? -He said he'd miss today. -Will he miss Mami's concert? -Yes. He said he had something to think about. Yuu! You really like toys, right? Hurry up! The concert will start soon. You were waiting for it, right? -I don't want. -What? I'm stupid. Just like Midori said. We're too close, but I didn't notice. I think I'm late, but... He said I shouldn't be crazy about Mami. No! -You have to be at this concert! -No. Just take it easy, Yuu. What do you mean? -Toshio! -If you're with Mamoru, it's better. You're a really good match with him. Don't say it like that! Yuu. Toshio, you're silly! What are you thinking about? I really like you, Toshio! That's why I'm worried! Midori! Toshio! Weren't you supposed to come with Yuu? She'll watch it with her gran. It would be better with you. How can I say it? It's about her visibility. When we see Mami, we don't see Yuu. I need to hurry up! This sound! What? The ship Feather Star is coming! Isn't it early? If Toshio recalls it, so Toshio recalled it early. The ship is coming early. What will we do? I don't think I can sing till the end, but I'll sing until I can. Probably, it's the last transformation. Go for it, Yuu! Yay! Well, let's start the last performance! Mami! Mami! Mami! -Today they're watching her quietly. -Yeah. When this performance is finished, we'll have to get back to the Feather Star. Pino Pino is coming. He can't delay coming of the ship. -I was thinking about his delay. -And what? Will he give her some time to finish singing? Look! If he listens to it, maybe he will. -How did she change her clothes? -I don't know. Toshio! Is anyone here? Do you have any problems? -Are you from Parthenon Production? -Yeah. Can you page one person? Page? Can you page Morisawa Yuu? It's really important. It's impossible during the concert. Even if we page her, she can't hear. It's raining badly. It became even worse. If the rain gets worse, we'll have to finish the concert. It seems like she wants to finish her program. It's much better. When she finishes this song, we'll stop the concert. Shingo! -Where are you looking at? -Silly! -What? We're talking about the rain. Look carefully! No one is going home! Right. There's no need to stop the concert. Mami. Are you Yuu? Let's sing the last song. He's coming! What's going on? Mami! Pino Pino, give me one minute, please! Yuu! Hi! -Pino Pino! -We had a deal. -You have to give your powers back. -Just a bit more. -Wait for only one song, please. -But-- -Wait for it. -We already have to come back. It's not time yet! I'm telling you to wait a bit! -Nega! -Just five minutes more, please! It's impossible! That boy remembers! You can do something with it. Just make him forget! Don't you understand? Why can't you just wait a bit? Calm down! Everyone, calm down please! Just one song, please! I'll finish the concert after it. I can't become Morisawa Yuu again until I sing this song! Pino Pino! Mami, come back! Mami, come back! Mami, come back! Mami, come back! Mami, come back! Mami, come back! Mami, come back! Mami, come back! So, I'll listen to your song too. It'll be the last song. You'll understand everything. Listen to it, please! It's my new song. Sensitive Love. Play the song! Play it! It's Yuu! It's Yuu! Pino Pino is also doing something. What happened? When this song is finished, we'll leave Yuu. It's not finished yet. Don't cry! I understand it. We would be happy we're coming back. Why do we have to cry? We should laugh, silly! Let's laugh. I'm laughing! What happened? We still have a bit of time left. You supported me for one year. We were working together. -I could be selfish like Mami. -What is she doing? It's time to say goodbye. Thank you! I want to thank you more. Thank you so much! Pino Pino, that's enough. Thank you! Yuu! It was fun, but... But? Where's the Feather Star? It'd be great if I could visit you again. It's nowhere. It also means it's everywhere. You see sometimes even the puddle can be the entrance. Well then, we'll meet again. It depends on you. She was wearing a mystic robe, so now she came back to her magical world. Toshio. Yuu! -Yuu was Creamy-- -Yuu is Yuu, right? Yes. -Can you see it? -Yes. I can. Poji and Nega also came back. But Yuu is here. Toshio. Since I said goodbye to Nega and Poji and give Pino Pino the magic compact back, it's been one month already. Where? Where is it? If you're loud, they'll disappear. Come here. -It's empty. -Someone probably took them. If I wasn't in show business any more, I started to forget about Creamy Mami. I was spending my summer holidays as a quite simple student. -But-- -I found them. Nega! Poji! It hurts! -They're not the same, but still. -Right. Come here. There's no need to run. I'm not scary. -I said I'm not scary. -Yuu, there! Wait! I said wait! -I'm home! -Yuu! What happened? -I can leave them, right? -No way! Why? -They're dirty! -You have to wash them first. -And then can I keep them? -Okay then. Okay. Even if she quits her career, her songs are still popular. -Will she come back? -Probably. Unfortunately. It's impossible. Did you pick their names, Yuu? I picked! Poji, and Nega. Hey! Nega! Dear passengers, our plane has just landed. Shingo! Welcome! How was your trip to Los Angeles? It was okay. How's Kidokoro? He's the same. I'm glad. It's sudden, but I think I can't be your manager now. I have a big project. What's with this big project? -Hi! -Hi! We've already started the project. Is it okay? This time I want everything to be carefully considered. Wait! Explain it to me! -Megumi. -What? Can you get her home? Shingo! Nice to meet you. My name is Hayakawa Ai. Shingo helped me a lot. What are you-- -Yuu! -Silly! It'd be better if Midori plays with us. -He doesn't want to bother us. -Huh? -Why? -Why? Actually, He thinks it's our date. No, no. I'm confused. Today in our broadcast we will talk about Creamy Mami. According to reports, Mami is studying dance in America. Toshio! Listen to the radio now, Toshio! It's broken. What? The man on the radio really said it. Mami was studying dance in America. That's why there are rumors about her comeback. -Yes. -But it's impossible. -It's weird. -What? I thought you'd be glad to hear about her, but you seem angry. -It's because-- -It's unlikely. Why? She quit once, but it's not strange if she comes back. We often hear Mami's songs recently, right? Image video. It'll be for sale soon. Creamy Mami who came back. You're right. It's better not to think about it. Hey, Toshio! Yuu! You also want to see her. Pino Pino was so angry today. Why can't we come here? He's cold-hearted. We can't just come back. Is she doing okay? Is she interested in someone? If she discovered us, won't it be hard again? It hurts! Hey! How are they doing these days? Nega is short-tempered. And Poji... I got you! Let's go home. She's worried about something. Let's check on her next time. Pino Pino said we couldn't do anything. We're just watching. Isn't it okay? We're always with her. Isn't it great? Right. We can be with her a bit more. Hi! Yuu! Toshio, look. Huh? They're hiding under the temple. It seems like they came back. It can't be true! And Mami? Hello! -Mr. Kidokoro, what's going on? -The manager isn't here. I am not working in Mami's project. Mr. Tachibana is the only one who meet her? I don't know. I didn't talk to him yet. He said it's called Project M. He's thinking about her second debut. He started to do this after his trip to Los Angeles. Probably, the manager still didn't get in touch with Mami. Yes. -Where's Shingo? -At the NPV TV. He'll be back at three. Okay. Do you want this? Thank you. The name of the girl, who came to Japan with Mr. Tachibana from Los Angeles, is Hayakawa Ai. What does it mean that he met Mami in Los Angeles? We have to find out. How? -It's terrible. -Tachibana is lying. Why is he doing it? Today isn't the only day that you asked me about that. Not only us? -Ayase Megumi. -Megumi? Probably, she's still in the cafe on that hill. Let's go. Wait for me. She didn't cook my okonomiyaki yet. Don't you want to help me? Yes. Is Mami coming back to Japan? I heard it from four celebrities, I thought it was a joke. So, is it true she was studying dance in Los Angeles? Yes. They're practicing at the stadium on the other side of the road. She's prepared all of her application documents. But why Shingo... Why did he say she was wearing a mystic robe, and came back to her magical world? He was lying and secretly doing all of it for money. I can't forgive him for that! You can be glad. The gossip about Mami's second debut is probably true. It's said she was studying dance there. People say she'll come back to Japan. -It's stupid. -Aren't you happy? Mami. We'd like not to hear such rumors any more. That night Mami disappeared forever. She is nowhere. But she is etched in our memory. We still remember her voice. That's why it's enough. She'll be always shining in that moment. I can't explain it well, but we don't want her to come back. Raise your right hand for that! Isn't it left? Right. Let's join hands together. We won't let Mami come back. But unfortunately, it continued only in our imagination. Yuu. It's a call from Toshio. -Good morning. -It's terrible! Watch TV! Right. Creamy Mami's comeback plays the main role, in collaboration between Japan and US. So, what's this movie about? It's science fiction movie. I can only say this for now. I want to say one more thing. We're preparing a concert in one week for Mami's comeback. It would likely be a record-breaking concert. Let's hope so. Thank you so much for today. Today, Parthenon Pro-- It's impossible... Why? It's not a normal concert. I can't give you tickets. There will only be important people. For example, influential people in the film and music industry. All of them are really important people. -Please, do it somehow. -Mr. Kidokoro, please. It's difficult. I'd be glad to be a member of the project team, rather than be Megumi's manager. I wonder why they kicked me out of this project. It's an impostor. Someone pretends to be Mami. I think the same, but-- But what? Maybe there's another Mami, not me. No way! Toshio! Why did Pino Pino give me the magical compact? Because you saw the ship Feather Star. But you also could see it. -I'm not another Mami! -I know it! I was just thinking about that night at the final concert. There were so many spectators. Did no one see the ship? If someone saw the ship, maybe she could get the magical compact just as I did. Creamy Mami number two? Yes. Do you suspect anyone? I don't know. Do they know about it? I don't know. I don't understand what Pino Pino does. Only this? If you insist, I can tell more. Because her father is a diplomat, they live in America. -On summer holidays she-- -I just want to know, why she came to Japan with Shingo. Maybe he likes young girls. -Kidokoro! -I'm kidding! Anyway, she takes a role in Mami's comeback. I'll definitely find out. Are they following us? It's Megumi. I think they noticed us. They can't escape. Megumi, let's stop it! Let's stop! I'm also afraid! They're not chasing us anymore. Driving licence. They're here! Hey. It's you. -I didn't expect to meet you here. -I was looking for you. I just want to talk to her. It's okay. -What's your name? I am-- -I know. You're Ai. -My name is Morisawa Yuu. -Nice to meet you, Yuu. -I'm glad. -Why? I started to have more friends. When I came here, I made a lot of friends. Aren't you from Japan? We live in US because of my father's job. It's been six years already. So, you forgot about Japan, right? I come back sometimes, but it's the first time I'm here for a long time. Recently I watched a concert, of Creamy Mami. -On the Central Hippodrome? -Do you also like her? Yes. During this concert, do you-- There you are. Tachibana said he was coming back. Okay. We'll meet next time, okay? Yuu, did you also see an ark? The ark? -No, I think I didn't. -Okay then. -You're not in a mood. -Because of that girl. Did Yuu do anything? Shingo, maybe the thing we do Isn't that good? You tell me things you wouldn't say before. Right. I think so. What did she tell you? -Nothing. -I don't understand. Actually, Yuu can't predict things. Honestly, that girl is weird. I felt something is protecting her. That's why somehow-- You're overthinking. It's simply the question of where you're raised. As the daughter of a diplomat, it's no wonder you're good at strategy. You don't need to be ashamed of this. I didn't want to be born as the daughter of a diplomat. -Mr. Tachibana, did Yuu come? -She came to the television station. -She's so enthusiastic. -Yes. We can't do anything about it. We have a mountain of homework. Okay, let's go. If we don't make her do homework, her granny will get angry even at me. Friends. I'm jealous. I don't have any chance to talk to Ai. Today at 6 p.m. there'll be Creamy Mami's comeback concert. Yuu! You didn't do any of your homework! What about the written invitation? Did you receive it? I tried everything and couldn't get it. -Everything? -I couldn't get it! Are you sure you tried everything? I'm always thinking about the comeback of Mami who disappeared. If I received an invitation letter, I'd take it. Right? -So we can't enter. -Megumi and Kidokoro? We also can't. -Really? -That's okay. We aren't members of the project or invitees, that's why we can't go. -It's so weird! -Yeah, it is. -Shingo is silly. -One more chocolate parfait. There's only one way. There are so many concerts recently. What do you want? -Wait, wait! Do you want to do it? -Do what? Excuse me. We're already partners, Mr. Kidokoro. Manager, I was deceived. I'm not a bad person. So, what about that way? We're not the only people who want to go there, but can't. All right, I'll explain. -Toshio. -You are not up to it, right? -Yes. -Listen. We don't care that someone can be Creamy Mami number two, but this someone can't use Creamy Mami's name. -Am I right? -Yes. It's better to stop, isn't it? I know, but we can't be involved. But... Aren't you curious which Mami will appear? I want to see. -The Project M has started. -Let's do it! Hello, Dad. Do you have a poster at Crepe cafe? Yes, about Mami's concert. Don't forget! Hey! Do you still have Mami's portrait? Yes. Today at 6 p.m. Where's the phone? Creamy Mami? Yes, I understand but, it's today at Asia Sunpro. Can I use the phone? Ryoko. Yes, it's Megumi. Do you still do your radio program at 4 p.m.? I really want to go there. Yes. Thank you. What! I already said you couldn't enter without a written invitation. So many fans came here. Is everything okay? What? It's difficult to keep them there. Fans want to enter fiercely! What? Creamy Mami's comeback concert is held at 6 p.m. Everyone is kindly invited. They will finish the rest. Hello. Asia Sunpro is on fire! Excuse me. Is it the police? Today in Asia Sunpro, there will be illegal drug trafficking. Can I pass? There's no one. Yay! It's happening. Let us go inside! -I'm selling this. -What? -6 p.m. -It's started! The policeman has to do something about such a situation! I'm also the fan of Mami! Why? You! First of all, fans are sitting and waiting. Fans will be there until they understand Mami isn't coming. You did a really foolish thing! That's not true. You got tired of Project M and wanted to create Mami's comeback! It's not about that. From the start, it was a plan to show that Mami still exists. What? When I was in Los Angeles, I met Ai. To be honest, at that day of Mami's final concert there was a child who said he saw a ship in the sky. A ship! Look! There's a ship in the sky! I thought it was a joke. There was also this strange light. I thought you used special installation to play a trick that Mami disappeared. But we didn't. There was no tricks at that stage. -Everyone knew about it. -When Shingo told me about it, I remembered the child talk about a ship. That's why I thought it could be true. But where's the connection between that day and today? I wanted to check it with my own eyes. That's why we made up this new project to check if there's a ship or not. You thought Mami would appear because of the comeback concert? Perhaps, the ship would appear as well, right? Yes. We spread rumours about a dance school and application documents. We did a lot for nothing. I'm surprised. Shingo, did you think you'd see this ship? No way. If the plan went well, even with no presence of Mami, we'd be able to spark a boom for her popularity. That's why we worked together. The plan went great. I could sell her records. -I see. -I don't admire him! It's not good! This conversation isn't good. You said this child could see the ship. He could see it. Isn't it enough? Why did you want to deceive people and check it? There was no need to do it. I started, to like you from the first sight, just like when I saw Yuu. I don't want to hear this conversation anymore. By the way, what will we do with fans waiting there, Tachibana? -Right. Kidokoro! -Yes? You can sing Mami's songs in a cute way! Go to the stage! What are you talking about? I won't! You can do it, Kidokoro! Where's Poji and Nega? Mami! If you use so much power, Pino Pino will be angry. Yes. I just have to do it. So I'll do the same. Yuu. Thank you. I think you have a good taste. Next year I'll come back to Japan with Mom and Dad. Ai! Bye-bye, Ai! -Let's go. -Why didn't you tell me? If I told you the truth, you wouldn't let me. Right. That's why I was only doing Project M. By the way, about that science fiction movie. Where Mami is the main actress, right? -You're the main one. -Really? But, I'm still angry. I'll come back today alone. Wait. I have something else to say. Midori! We'll also come back soon. What happened with them so suddenly? I found them! I found Poji and Nega. Hey! I'm okay!
