I swear, [My life, part 1] if ever my life should have a meaning, and my name be wreathed with fame, you should remember that on this evening, it was you who made me into what I now lay eternally at your feet. Either shall I founder, ridiculed and mocked, like no one before me, if ever I should forget, betray, abandon those things that were planned here and are coming to pass; or I shall, with daemonic heat, in infinite ecstasy, kneel down amidst all mankind and do things no other man has ever dared to do, or think or write or say or shout or sing. And I am calling you, sacred one, all-embracing night of love. Descend onto me. Follow me to the most desolate grounds man has ever known. Abysses of darkest lust of my sufferings, for the first and last time in the silent depths of my awareness of the sadness of love - of this one final word, unto death. Thus I begin the desolate dream of my pitiable life, dedicated to you in all the gravity of our happiness. May it be yours. In spite of redeeming self-renunciation of your lost consciousness and all sudden awareness and of your playing, I am yours. Great Mother Night, who gave birth to Music, all-embracing infinity from evening to morning, beginning and end. Goddess of my life, my only love, in the changing figures of my work, I am yours. If ever a man had sworn to surrender himself and did not know why and wherefore and on account of what guilt or distress, it was done here, out of a sullen, submissive pride at the joyful service of the cosmos of love, kneeling down before you ... enigmatic night: Laughing I must love you. Laughing I shall suffer blindness; laughing let us face our doom, laughing we shall perish. Farewell, you laughing world, Crumble into dust, you stately castles! Farewell, resplendent world of the gods! End in bliss, you eternal race! Rend the runic cord, you Norns! # Gods' # twilight. # Gleam darkly # Night of destruction # drift down like fog # radiant love # laughing death! In the night, shortly before his death, Richard Wagner saw all the women of his life, "his womenfolk", as he said to Cosima his wife, pass by one by one. And so they became one, united in a single monologue that began with a letter to Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient and ended with the merging of his figures in his work. Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient, the 16-year-old Richard Wagner saw her in 1829 as Beethoven's Fidelio and carried an impassioned letter to her hotel, and he wrote after her death: "Her life was marred by one major source of sorrow: She never found the man who would have been fully worthy of the bliss she could bestow. And yet she yearned for nothing more than a quiet, joyful, domestic life; even though, on the other hand, through her consummate skill as hostess and housekeeper, she knew how to make it homely and secure and attractive. It was always those dreadful yet raptuous outbursts of the soul that poured out of her in the course of this incomparable double life on the stage, that helped her forget what she imagined to be her unfulfilled vocation in life. But even as an artist her consciousness was not capable of a true feeling of contentment." In letters and diaries, carefully bound, and sheets of music - to Minna, his first wife and against Minna in favour of Mathilde Wesendonck, the wife of his patron, and against Hans von Bülow, his friend, in favour of Cosima, his former wife and his future. With Ludwig, the king whom they called Parsifal, and against Ludwig who supported them, and in favour of Judith Gautier, the young Frenchwoman, against Cosima the thin one, for whom he ordered the perfumes and fabrics from Paris, he said, from her friend, he said, but in fact for himself. To Minna and Mathilde and Cosima and Judith the ancient vow of the first and last night. Words whispered, written, concealed, written in lonely nights with trembling desire, holy vows, in Venice's damp palaces, on the mountains of the King, during long baths at Wahnfried, attended by servants and barbers, sneaking round the house-corners of Bayreuth, and through the parks of the Wesendonck's in Switzerland, harmlessly and furtively, hiding himself behind masks, in perfumes and fabrics, [requests] forbidden, burnt, banished, once and again and again, stimulating, yet painful, killing and soothing, essential and yet in vain, as usual, and sublimated into the tremendous echo of his oeuvre, nights fulfilled and long, holy vows of the night, everything poured into one, and for the music of the changing figures ... Amen. # Descend, o night of love # grant oblivion that I may live; # take me up into your bosom, # release me from the world # Extinguished now the last glimmers; # what we thought, what we imagined # all thought, all remembering, # the glorious presentiment of sacred twilight # extinguishes imagined terrors, world-redeeming. # The sun concealed itself in our bosom, # the stars of bliss gleam, laughing, # softly entwined in your magic, # sweetly dissolved before your eyes; # heart on your heart, mouth on mouth; # the single bond of a single breath; # my glance is deflected, dazzled with bliss, # the world pales with its blinding radiance: # lit by day's guileful deception, # standing firm against deceitful delusion, # then am I myself the world; # floating in sublime bliss, # life of love most sacred, # never again to waken the sweetly conscious undeluded wish # take heed of the voice of one keeping solitary watch at night, # you upon whom love's dream smiles ... Our love - what can match it? [to Minna ??? ] Oh, to be with you now, now! To feel your presence, lose myself in your gaze, unite myself with your dear body, all my afflictions would be dissolved in your wonderful sweet embrace! Minna, what's keeping me? I hasten to you, come what may. Perhaps all will be well when I am with you. Everything will perhaps happen faster, take a different turn. Oh God in Heaven, do you feel as ardently as I do? Tell me, should I? Should I? Do you hope so? Oh, unhappy me! These lines must be quickly sent: they burn my fingers. Tell me, should I come, should I ... swiftly, swiftly answer your Richard. You know how much I always give in to my main sentiment, how it never never deserts me. My heart is always apprehensive I have the constant feeling it will break. If one tries to make me laugh, I cry. Ah, and the restlessness of the night; every morning it tears me, as if with a seizure of the heart, from my sleep. Thoughts swirl through my head, hundreds of ideas, as if I had been awake all day. Minna, we are using up our youth like this! Put an end to this state; I have suffered too much already! I swear it to you. Your Richard. # where can I find you, holy grail # full of yearning my heart is searching for you The tremendous struggles we withstood, how could they end but with a victory over all wishes and desires. Did we not know, in the warmest moments of intimacy, that this should be our goal! In a mighty palace [3.9.1858] in which I am still quite alone ... Spacious, noble rooms in which I stroll about at will. Since my living space, as the protective shell for my working mechanism, is so important to me, I take the utmost care to furnish it according to my needs. I immediately ordered the Érard. In my grand palacial hall it will certainly sound wonderful. The tremendous and strange stillness of the Canal suits me admirably. At 5 o'clock in the evening I leave my apartment to dine. Then I take a walk in the public gardens. A brief stay on St. Mark's Square, which is stimulating in a quite theatrical manner, by virtue of its special characteristics. But they are entirely strange to me and leave me unmoved, the throngs of people. Towards 9 o'clock I return home by gondola. I find the lamp lit and read a little until it is time to sleep. Outwardly my life will flow by in this manner, and I am quite content with that ... I hope to to get better for your sake! [3.9.1858] To keep myself for you means, to keep myself alive for my art. To live with it, as a consolation to you, that is my task. It is in accordance with my nature, my fate, my will, my love. So I am yours, and so shall you too convalesce through me. Here I shall complete Tristan, in spite of all the world's rantings. Well, let's start, my hero Tristan, my heroine Isolde, help me. Help my angel. Here you shall both bleed to death, here shall your wounds heal and be closed. From here the world shall learn of the noble, exalted anguish of sublime love, the lamentations of the most sorrowful bliss. Yes, my good, pure, beloved one, we shall be victorious. We are already in the midst of victory. When, in the evening, [16.9.1858] I take a gondola to the Lido, a sound envelops me like that of the soft, long-sustained strain of a violin which I love so much and which I once compared to you. Now you can imagine how I felt, out there in the moonlight, how I felt out on the sea. A year ago today [18.9.1858] I completed the poem of Tristan and brought you the last act. You led me to the chair by the sofa, embraced me and you said: now I have no further wish. On that day, at that hour, I was born anew. Up to then it had been "my pre-life", now began" my post-life". In that wonderful moment I truly lived. You know what pleasure it gave me? Not ebulliently, not tempestuously intoxicated, no, solemnly, pervaded by the emotion, warmed mildly, free, as if looking on eternity. From the world I had painfully yet ever more firmly divorced myself. Everything inside me had turned to rejection, to negation. Painful even my artistic creation had become. For it was longing, an unquenched longing, for that state of negation, of rejection, to find the affirmative, the personal, that which would fuse itself with me. At that moment it occurred to me, with such unerring certainty, that a divine state of suspension took hold of me. A lovely woman, shy and timid, bravely threw herself into the midst of a sea of pain and suffering, to bring about this wonderful moment for me, to say to me: "I love you". Thus you consecrated yourself to death, to grant me life. Thus I received your life, only to depart from this world with you, to suffer with you, to die with you. Now the spell of longing was solved. And this one thing you know: that since then I have never been in conflict with myself. Confusion and torment may have fallen upon us. Even you may have been entranced by the delusion of passion. But I, and that you know, I remained the same, and my love for you could never, not for one moment, however terrible, lose its perfume ... lose not a single drop of that perfume. All bitterness was taken from me, I may have erred, suffered, felt tormented, but it was always obvious to me, I always knew clearly that your love was my highest possession and that without it my existence would be a contradiction within itself. I thank you, my dear lovely angel. What did I have to undergo with Parsifal? [30.5.1859]] When my old friend Brünnhilde springs onto the pyre, I throw myself after her and hope for a blissful end. Amen. No, [1.1.1859] you must never regret them, the caresses with which you enriched my meagre life! I had not known them, those lovely flowers that blossom from the purest soil of noble love. What I had dreamt as a poet, came wonderfully true one day. On the mean ground of my earthly existence would one day fall this softly stimulating, transfiguring dew of delight. I had never hoped for it, yet now I feel as if I had known it all the time. Ah ... I can still smell it, the entrancing perfume of those flowers which you plucked from your heart. Those were not the germs of life, those were the fragrant miraculous flowers of heavenly death, of eternal life. Once they adorned the fallen hero's body before being burnt to divine ashes. Into this grave of flames and sweet fragrances she, the loving one, plunged to mingle her ashes with those of her beloved. Now they were one. A single element. Not two living beings. Divine primeval matter of eternity. No. You must never regret them, those flames that burnt so radiantly, pure and bright. No dark embers, no vapours, no fearful fumes ever polluted them. That pure, chaste flame that only shone its bright transfiguring light on us, that's why no one else can know of it. Your caresses, they are the crowning glory of my life, the sweet roses that bloomed for me from the crown of thorns which once adorned my brow. Now I am proud and happy. No wishes, no longings, pleasure, most intense consciousness, strength and the ability to do anything, to fight against all the torments of life. No. You mustn't regret them. You must never regret them. Ah, Mathilde, [Aug. 1860] again Parsifal kept me awake. I can see him more and more clearly now. Once it all has matured completely, the execution of the poem will be an immense pleasure. I keep away from it as long as I can, and I only return to it when I cannot withstand its violent pull. But then this wonderful process of creation lets me forget all my misery. Shall I talk about it? Did I ever tell you that the fabulously wild grail messenger is the same creature as the seductress of the 2nd act? Ever since I understood this, almost everything of the plot became clear to me. Guess what happens here, and how it all turns out. I shall say no more today! # How softly and gently he smiles, # how sweetly his eyes open - # can you see, my friends, # do you not see it? # How he glows ever brighter, # raising himself high amidst the stars? # Do you not see it? # How his heart swells with courage, # gushing full and majestic in his breast? # How in tender bliss sweet breath gently wafts from his lips - # Friends! # Look! Do you not feel and see it? # Do I alone hear this melody # so wondrously and gently # in bliss lamenting, all-expressing, # gently reconciling, sounding from within him, # piercing me, soaring aloft, # its sweet echoes resounding about me # ringing out clearly, surging around me # Are they gentle aerial waves? # Are they billows of blissful fragrance? # As they seethe and roar about me, # shall I breathe, shall I give ear? # Shall I drink of them, plunge beneath them? # Breathe my life away in sweet scents? # In the heaving swell, in the resounding echoes, # in the universal stream of the world-breath - # to drown, to founder - # unconscious - utmost rapture! Late yesterday evening [Brown Book 10.8.1865]] during the arduous ascent I glanced upward, dead-tired yet wanting to reach the heights, hoping to catch a glimpse of the goal of our wanderings. There, over the ridge of the mountains, I saw the first star, blinking brightly. Without thinking in which direction I was gazing, I assumed it to be the evening star and called out to greet it: "Cosima". That cheered me. It was quite wonderful. The star, growing ever brighter, all alone, no other star in sight. It was completely dark before I arrived at the top, far ahead of the others, with a great bunch of keys to unlock the hut. The last key I tried proved to be the right one. Slowly I got my bearings in the dark and I found the bedchamber of the King. Oh, Cosima! [18.8.1865] You are the soul of my life, completely and utterly. I gazed out into the plains in search of "home", imagined Munich without you. Nothing but a tomb. Nothing, nothing, without you! You are the soul of everything that is still alive within me. Goodnight. Parsifal has written well - worked too. Goodnight, Cosima. Just now, as I was browsing in the brown book [26.10.1865] I read something from Parsifal. How that time is past now, like a sacred dream, another paradise lost. Oh Cosima, will it ever be possible to complete my works in peace and reach the promised land of rest and repose with you? How over and over ... and over again the storm keeps blowing. I require, it seems, the most unnatural condition, which the world simply does not provide. My worries are great. There is always something new pressing and hunting me, from within and without. This kingly love would seem to be a veritable martyr's crown. Treachery lurks with a tension that our gentle yearning for peace is no match for. Ah, my love, my love, should we not set out soon for the quiet path, for the cool place of rest? "Happy!" Yes, we could be: I have an incredible propensity for being made happy. All I need is to be packed up properly and wrapped softly, and my inner vapours are released and rise freely into the air, towards smiles and delight. Ah, my love Cosima, Cosima Cosima So, my sweet woman, [28.10.1865] that too has been overcome and ended. This time tomorrow I shall rest in my lovely bed and await the witching hour. I know now that I shall find peace. I know that without this repose I cannot go on. All my sufferings are but restlessness. Let everyone conspire against me, all I want is to be left in peace. The first attack on it will sever all my connections with the world forever. Parsifal is again wrapped around in a web. But I believe in him and won't budge. He shall come, or I shall go. Peace I must have and shall have. Oh God, such heavens I wanted to build for you and Parsifal. Only one thing should touch my life nerve really, only my beloved could do that. But I believe only the loss of you, your death could cause that. The errors and misunderstandings that make you blind and unfair towards me, affect me merely like the other trials of life although for a different reason. As long as I know that they do not touch the inmost core of my being, because they could never penetrate that far, I feel that you do not touch it; because you merely pass it by, regarding a chimaera as the truth. But I also know that love helps you and that the wonderful clarity of your vision will soon make you see the truth. That I know, for I believe. And so I believe in Parsifal too. My dreams reveal the dangers to me, but they can't harm me, only him, and his faith must protect him, otherwise ... No, it will. And now peace and rest, peace and rest, just as it is peaceful deep inside me. I want to attain outward peace from within. I am determined to, for I must. You'll help and set a good example for Parsifal, won't you? Setting an example, however, means not forgiving but repenting, repenting, that you could suffer anguish on my account. Is that bold? It is the only true way. Do not suffer, do not suffer. Just love! Good morning, beloved. [13.11.1865] Parsifal listened with uncommon seriousness ... Truly, only now have I become aware of all the majesty and sublimity of his love. He surpasses everything imaginable. He ... is ... Me, in a new, beautiful, youthful reincarnation; wholly Me, and he is only so much He as is necessary for him to be beautiful and powerful. But there is not a wrinkle: a love that is pure love. To be equal to this wonderful trust, completely and fulfillingly, is my final glorious task in life. Oh, my Cosima, we shall be happier than ever mortals were, for we three are immortal. Death cannot sever our bond; and yet I hope that through great age I may make up for what might differentiate us in life span. All that remains to be done is to create the works. We cannot obtain greater happiness. It is not possible. The spring of triple-life is in full bloom. Summer can merely ripen the fruit. Believe me, I cannot write much more for you in the Brown Book. My consciousness of what has been experienced is fading; and its content is neither to be written about or spoken of. Just to talk intimately, to joke, - as about my earlier life: Then to create, to work, to be true, good, beautiful, genuine. There’s nothing more to be done. Believe me, we are in heaven! And now ... peace and rest, peace and rest. How fortunate we are! And how blissful we shall always be! Nothing else is possible. You see, I can't say anything else. All we can do is look at each other, be active, efficient, love each other and keep silent. We are not of this world You, He and I. We can only marvel at finding ourselves so, because we simply happen to be in this world. But now there’s no sense in even marvelling any more: now we know, soar, and bring each other mutual happiness. Spring sun! [7.2.1866] I sat on the bench in front of the house. Great warmth, the first buds on the bushes. To the right in the fir trees the finches are calling; beneath them Pohl's* grave. [his dog] Day breaks, or is it night? Over there my wife lies mouldering; my beloved languishes. And here? Spring! Day ... night ... A beautiful sense of the sanctity of night had the Hellenes. The deepest understanding of this must have experienced those men who attended a great performance of the Oresteia of Aeschylus. It began in broad daylight: Agamemnon, full of human folly, crime, desire. Afternoon: Elektra: revenge, atonement, punishment. With the Eumenides dusk falls. At the end, deepest night. The young men escort the appeased daemons of revenge in torchlight procession to their nocturnal places of rest. And now the sanctity of the sense of night gives birth to playful merriment. By torchlight the fauns and satyrs are frolicking, gambolling and playing tricks, the drunken creatures scrambling for a resting-place. The world lightly sheds its burden and gravity and peace become possible. Here sleep, there death ... That must have been beautiful. And they performed it at the approach of spring. How the circle of life [16.9.1867] draws ever tighter. All the blood rushes to the heart To die in love. The limbs grow pale. Life falls away from me. What love means, only a man of my age can discover. The grave of life. The world continues to live for me as long as the brain obeys the heart. How tired I am. Oh Cosima, [20.9.1867] how proud and happy I am! Your day! I had a beautiful dream about you. But to be aware of you, to know, to be clearly conscious what you mean to me ... Ah! It is worth a great deal of suffering. But how could I not be aware of it? I can, after all, see it and grasp it. Day by day the thrill of emotion grows which I feel when I see little Eva. There lies, there lives and laughs the clear proof that I too was born in Arcadia. My dear dear wife, behold, all has succeeded and all succeeds: child and work. Whom would we envy? My dear. [to Judith Gautier 2.9.1876] My dear, I am sad. Another reception this evening, but I shall not come down. I am reading again a few pages of recollection from my life I once dictated to Cosima. She sacrifices herself for her father who is used to big receptions. Unfortunately! Did I embrace you for the last time this morning? No, I shall see you again, I wish it because I love you. Farewell. Be good to me. Dearest soul, [ ??? ] now I am exchanging letters with you. You will soon realize how meticulous I am. In connection of the two pairs of slippers Cosima chose, there were also mentioned two day dresses you should be able to find at M. Felix's. How much I would have liked a line from you. I can still see you here, from my desk, before me, to my right, on the chaise-longue, looking at me. God, with what eyes! Whilst I was writing mementos for my poor opera singeresses. What is so outrageous is the fact that you represent the plenitude my poor existence which is so pacified and sheltered, now that I have Cosima. You are my riches, my intoxicating surfeit. A fine expression, don't you think? But that's not important. You understand me, Farewell, Judith. Dear soul, [ ??? ] sweet friend, I love you as much as ever. You shall always remain for me the only ray of love in these days which are for some so pleasant, and for me were so unsatisfactory. But they were for me full of a sweet enfolding and intoxicating fire. Oh how much I wanted to kiss you again, my dear sweet woman. I am sorry about the way you have to live, but everything must make one feel sorry for, especially I myself, if I followed your advice and forgot about you. My dear soul, [ ??? ] my sweet friend, no longer scream or protest. Of the experience of your embraces, I think of them as the highest moment, the most enthralling intoxication of my life. It is the final gift of the gods who didn't want to let me succumb to the grief over the false glory of the Nibelungen performances. But why speak of miserable things. I'm not screaming, but in my best moments I retain a sweet and beneficial longing, a longing to embrace you once more, never to loose your divine love. You are mine, aren't you? My dear friend [1.10.1877] Cosima has asked me to write to you about a few errands with which I shall bother you when the time comes to think about New Year presents. In the meantime I shall use this address, fine. Choose a perfume to suit your own taste, entirely to your own taste, and add about half a dozen paper sachets, so that I can slip them between my own linen, which will put me on good terms with you when I sit down at the piano to compose the music of Parsifal. All of this address to Herr Bernard Schnappauf, barber, Ochsengasse, Bayreuth, it should come as a surprise. Yes, it’s the music to Parsifal that is at stake. I couldn’t live any longer without throwing myself into a task of this kind. Help me! Now, when ... how ... But so be it. Love me, and let's not wait for a Protestant heaven: it's bound to be very boring! - My love! My love! Never stop loving me! A thousand - from your Richard Wagner. P.S. [22.11.1877] I have forgotten something that compels me to write to you again. Oh, my dear Judith, the slippers without heels! But, no, another thing: for my chaise-longue I want a very beautiful and exceptional blanket which I shall call Judith. Listen! Try and find one of those silk fabrics called Lampas or something. Yellow satin background - the palest possible - with a floral pattern - roses; the design not too large, it is not intended for curtains; it is used, rather, for small pieces of furniture. If there is nothing in yellow, then a very light blue. Possibly on white background, which will be easier to find. I shall need 6 meters of it. All this for mornings well spent on Parsifal. Farewell my dearest, my dolcissima amica. I have reclaimed this letter from the servant who was going to post it, since Herr Schnappauf has just brought me your latest. - Beautiful, beautiful ... And now the errands: I'm writing to Felix at once to deliver to you the Japanese robe. Slippers, babouches! Agreed! The gloves - like the attached sample, I think, chamois. Nothing else. Ah, my love, my love, and again, my love, my love! About our correspondence-perfume, [ ??? ] Please give it serious thought. Perhaps "Exquisite" by Rimmel, if you agree. Personally I'd prefer pure "Rose", but it must be a heavy scent. Tell me the costs of all those things and I'll send you the amount straightaway. You find me in exuberantly sprightly mood. [ ??? ] I compose music and I couldn't care a damn about life, about the entire world. I feel myself loved and I myself love. At last I'm writing the music to Parsifal Cosima is doing a French translation for you. Amongst the samples I'm sending you, I also enclose one of my music. # take my blood # take my body # in token of our love! # take my body # take my blood # in remembrance of me! Adieu, my dearest, love me forever. Cosima has sent you the next part of the translation. [ ??? ] Be kind to it. Of all the perfumes, I prefer the one in the small wooden flacon. I shall use it with care. But I beg you to send me one or two of those charming atomizers, for I fear, because of my clumsiness, I shall ruin them soon. Ah, Judith, cheer up, I feel better than ever. They keep everything away from me that might distract my soul, and I concentrate purely on my music. The composition of the 1st act will soon be finished and soon I'll send you a short extract. Ah, stay in good health and be of good spirits. Believe me, all I suffer from is knowing that you are worthy of a love that will make you completely happy. Will you always love me, you dear beloved soul? The telegram has arrived, the Japanese robe as well. It was sent back, with additional things, to your address, have you received it? About the pattern, I want nothing but roses, maybe you'll find some on white background. You are quite right not to be stingy and not to buy vulgar stuff. You received the 1.000 francs? I have not yet received anything other that the tiny scrap of cloth in your letter. Shall I return that too? I can see that you love me a little bit, because you take care of those trifles for me. The final melody? Regard it as a sheet for your album. But you'll see, Klingsor's flower maidens in the 2nd act, blossoms in his ensorcelled garden, tropical. In spring they blossom and live until autumn. Young girls, naive and dainty, who beguile the heroes of the grail. They carress Parsifal, stroke his cheeks, like children playing. Maybe one day they shall sing the melody, "come along, young hero, handsome youth etc." # come # come # handsome youth, come # You'll see, and like it. If you don't, will you still love me, nevertheless? Oh yes. I hope so. And even if you don't want to, I'll kiss you nonetheless. Oh, I possess already something that I call "Judith". Farewell ... farewell ... Ah, my Judith, let's not torment each other any longer with this wretched business. I renounce the pink satin. As to the perfumes, follow your own taste entirely. Proceed as you see fit. Anything you suggest would be welcome to me, even the cold creams. But I need for myself a heavier scent, made from roses, because my sense of smell is impaired. You can also send two different fabrics, but of both 6 meters. Ah, such horrible weather. For weeks no sun and yet ... Parsifal, the holy fool ... adieu adieu Do you remember? Don't do anything so far as the satin is concerned. I'll renounce it. I am obsessed with a certain colour that is no longer to be found. What they offer is chamois or flesh-coloured. If it were only the colour of your flesh, then I'd have the pink tone I desire. But if you like, try to find one or even two more of those fabrics, à la Pompadour, striped, like I told you, 6 meters of each. As to the perfumes, I beg you buy in abundance bath essences etc, dozens of them, for we live in the wilderness, bereft of all the Graces. And now, my sweet friend, beautiful gifted woman, I still dream of the time when as a refugee I walked the dirty streets of Paris, forsaken by the whole world. Suddenly I meet you. It is you I encounter, Judith. You take my arm. You take me home with you. You smother me with kisses. Ah, it's deeply moving, deeply moving. Time and space, the foes! I should have found you then. It was a long time ago. I embrace you. Richard. May I keep your lovely drawings? Ah ... and the Japanese robe? Every hour I look at your marvellous painting with the black hair. Is that you? Your extracts fill me with anxiety. I might do something foolish again. As a rule I prefer powders. They adhere more gently to the fabrics, and so on and so on ... But I repeat: be lavish, particularly with the quantities of the bath essences with the ambergris brands, and so on and so on ... The bathtub is beneath my atelier, and I like it when the scents arise. Do not think badly of me. I'm old enough to be allowed to occupy myself with trifles again. I have 3 years of Parsifal before me, and nothing must distract me from the sweet peace of creative seclusion. Do come. Come! Oh, dear, intimately beloved soul, everything is so tragic, everything which is real. But you will always love me, and I couldn't do otherwise, even if I made the greatest effort. A thousand kisses. Oh, you women, if only you could understand us poor men a little better. Everyone is abusing us. Ah, believe me, all your sweet scents of Arabia cannot wash away the stain of my lack of recognition. Believe me, all your sweet scents of Arabia cannot wash away the stain of my lack of recognition. Can you laugh? Then, dear soul, laugh! Laugh! Oh, my dear deeply beloved, I am tired and seek the solitude of work and nothing else. "Lebe wohl" "farewell" or as they say in France, "adieu", commended to God, a problematic form of address. Hail, dearest, deeply beloved soul! Oh my Judith, you're not only beautiful, but you are also good beyond all measure. I wept when I took out of this box, the work of your charm and grace. For me there was more in it than I can express, the fragrance of your soul. How good and generous you are. May you also be happy. Tonight at 6 o'clock, before the children's eyes Christmas will shine in all its radiance while I bring over the presents for Cosima. She celebrates the hour of her birth at midnight. I imagine her surprise, her joy. For her letter of thanks you won't have to wait long And yet one thing you overlooked: one of your kisses that used to intoxicate me when I was so utterly exhausted. But one must be content all will be well, and soon you will hear from me again, from your sad, misjudged one. P.S. Everything has arrived except the slippers, but I expect they'll arrive during the day. I haven't yet formed an opinion about all those perfumed essences. The powder between the gloves that so enchanted me, was iris, I realized it later. I remain true to "rose". The little wooden box would seem to contain a veritable miracle. Well, in there must be the essences and liquids. Which products are for the bath, remains to be seen. If it is not a bother for you, I'll send you two samples of the woven fabric. I'll send them back to you. As to the perfumes, I accept the iris milk. Send me lots of it. I also accept the further consignment of white rose powder. But I advise you to buy rose powder by Rimmel. It's easy to check. I remember this fragrance to be the purest, most genuine scent of roses. If you don't mind, and if you accept, I would like to share with you a lot of this powder. I would also accept perfumes in liquid form, either the same Rimmel rose perfume or White Rose by Atkinson. You will give me precise instructions, I hope, how to make use of it, how to enjoy the contents of the little wooden flacon properly. Is that all? No, no! Tell me whether you still have any money left, and how much. We can then, and with greater certainty and sureness, make our arrangements. I embrace you, beautiful one, whom I love, dear adored soul, my child, my Judith. Parsifal is progressing well. [4.1.1878] Soon you will receive a few new bars. But [6.2.1878] how much I love it when I see my address written by your hand. Ah if only ... what? But that's the way of the world. Why in heaven's name did I not find you during my days in Paris after the fiasco of Tannhäuser? Were you too young at the time? But let's remain silent Let's remain silent and let us love ... love ... My dear friend, I have asked Cosima to take charge of your Paris errands from now on, [15.2.1878] or rather, to make the final arrangements regarding the various purchases with which I have been bothering you for so long. I also feel that it is proper to entrust to her as a woman these final instructions, since no more surprises are to be expected. Furthermore I am so disturbed by my affairs at the moment - highly unpleasant things - that I can no longer find the time to continue working on the Parsifal composition. Have pity on me. Everything will soon be finished, and soon I shall find again those wonderful moments of leisure when I enjoyed talking to you about myself. But do not torture yourself on my account, the things that oppress me will soon be over and done with. Be kind to Cosima, write to her properly and at length, I shall be informed about everything. Love me for ever, then you will often see me appear before you, and perhaps we shall see each other again one day, really see each other again. Your own Richard. You soul of a woman [???] Cosima if you only knew all the things I say to you when you're not here. What a wonderful evening, [Cosima's diary ??? ] Christmas Eve, the children rejoice, memories of Italy, everything cheerful, serene, grand, tears of pleasure and transfigured grief. To bed at 11. We can still hear the bells. Overwhelming words Richard says to me. I am fortunate. Oh God, oh Heaven, what have I done to deserve the happiness of seeing you content Richard calls me at midday, he wants to show me something: he plays and sings to me the divine scene of the uncovering of the Grail. It's as gentle and sublime as the salvation. Like an ancient legend told by angels, the words sound: wine and bread of the Last Supper. # take my blood Richard visits me when he returns from his walk and he says to me, you are a gift from Heaven, because of you I believe in God. Richard had a restless night. And in the evening he shows me the end of the 1st act as a draft. "Now all thank God." I'm praying. # Now all thank God. # with heart, mouth and hands # He does great things # for us and to all ends, # Who has done for our body and soul # from our childhood on # many uncountable good things # and does so still today. The suffering [ ??? ] I was afraid of didn't stay away. It burst upon me from outside. Grief, you old companion of mine, return, come and live with me, we two know each other. How long will you abide with me? You staunchest, only reliable friend? Cleanse me now. Make me worthy of you. I won't flee from you. But when will you bring your brother? When I am already lying in bed [Cosima's diary ??? ] I hear him speaking long and loud. I get up, go to his room. "I spoke to you" he told me, embraced me long and tenderly. Once in 5000 years such a wonder happens. I spoke of the Undine creatures who yearn for a soul. He goes to the piano, plays the plaintive theme "Rheingold, Rheingold" adds to it: "false and vile are all who revel above! That I was so sure of that then!" As he is lying in bed, he says, "I wish them well, those lowly creatures of the deep, those yearning ones." His last words, written at the desk at which he died: "love is tragedy" # Like rays of sunshine # streameth his light # the purest was he, who hath betrayed! # In wedlock traitor, true in friendship # from his heart's own true love, only beloved one, barred was he by his sword. # Truer than his were oaths ne'er spoken # faithful as he, none ever held promise # purer than his, love ne'er was plighted: Yet # oaths hath he scorned, bonds hath he broken, the faithfullest love none so hath betrayed! # Know ye why that was? # Oh ye, of vows the heavenly guardians! # Turn now your eyes on my grievous distress; # behold your eternal disgrace! # To my plaint give ear, thou mighty god! # Through his most valiant deed, by thee so dearly desired, # didst thou condemn him to endure the doom that on thee had fallen; # he, truest of all, must betray me, that wise a woman might grow! # Know I now all thy need? # All things, all things, all now know I. # All to me is revealed. # Wings of thy ravens wave around me; # with tidings long desired, I send now thy messengers home. # Rest thou, rest thou, o god! # My heritage I claim for myself. My heritage I claim for myself. # My heritage I claim for myself. # Accursed charm! Terrible ring! # Thy gold my hand grasps, and gives it away. # Ye sisters wise who dwell in the waters, # give ear, ye sorrowing Rhine maids, # good counsel lives in your redes: # what ye desire I leave to you: # from my ashes take ye your treasure! # Let fire, burning this hand, cleanse, too, the ring from its curse! # Ye in the flood, wash it away, # and purer preserve your shining gold that to your sorrow was stol'n. # Fly home, ye ravens! fly home you eagles you ravens fly home you eagles # tell your lord the tidings that here on the Rhine ye have learned! # To Brünnhilde's rock first wing your flight! # there burneth Loge: straight way bid him to Walhall! # For the the gods' twilight draweth now near. # So cast I the brand on Walhall's glittering walls. # Grane, my steed, I greet thee, friend! # Know'st thou now to whom and whither I lead thee? # In fire radiant, lies there thy lord, # Siegfried, my hero blest. # To follow thy master, joyfully neigh'st thou? # Lures thee to him the light with its laughter? # Feel, too, my bosom, how it doth burn; # glowing flames now lay hold on my heart: # fast to enfold him, embraced by his arms, # in might of our loving with him aye made one ... # Heiajaho! Grane! Give him thy greeting! # Siegfried! Siegfried! See! # your wife greets thee in bliss. # give back the ring! I have reached the point [to Meyerbeer 3.4.1840] where I must sell myself to someone in order to obtain help in material form. My head and my heart no longer belong to me, they are yours, my master. All that is left to me are my two hands. Do you wish to make use of them? I realize I shall have to become your slave with body and soul in order to find food and strength for my work which will one day tell you of my gratitude. I shall be a loyal and honest slave for I openly admit that I am a slave by nature, I can feel it inside me, it gives me endless pleasure to be able to devote myself to you recklessly, trusting blindly. The knowledge that I am only working and striving for you, makes that effort seem all the more agreeable and worthy. Buy me, therefore, Sir, it is by no means a wholly worthless purchase! This summer, when you might already draw healthy profits from me - this summer will destroy me utterly, for I have nothing to see me to the end of the fair month of May. But if you help me through until next winter, I may even be paying interest by then! - To put it bluntly: no usurer can help me any longer, not even an ordinary upright citizen can help me now; for he would never be able to understand how I could ever pay him back; the only person who can do so is someone whose far-seeing eye and overflowing heart sees and feels that I may yet produce a good tree which, providing there's no lack of rain, can also bear fruit. Goethe is dead. He was no musician either. There's nobody left but you. 2.500 francs will help me through the winter. Would you lend me this sum? my most deeply revered lord [18.1.1840] and master? master? master ... The ouverture to Faust I composed in greatest anguish and suffering from terrible toothache. In vain all my attempts to have my opera* accepted in the Renaissance theatre. [Liebesverbot] You alone can help. Terrorism is the only means, and you, my revered ruler of all the notes, you alone can wield it. I hope in this world for no salvation except from you. I implore you, by means of recommendations and support, to pave my way into Parisian society, thus help with even your tiniest beneficial support, to save at least half of my life. With all my sins and weaknesses, destitution and distress, I commend myself to you most respectfully, praying that I may be delivered from all evil, through God and yourself. As long as you remain favourably disposed towards me, then God too will be near me; that is why I ask you to remember, be it ever so briefly, your ardently respectful and obedient servant, Richard Wagner. The feelings of gratitude that imbue me towards you, my noble protector, know no bounds. I foresee that I shall follow you from aeon to aeon, babbling my thanks. Your, with heart and blood, eternally indebted servant, Richard Wagner My most deeply revered lord and master, [ ??? ] at the time I received your letter, my adored patron, when at once I realized completely what you were doing for me, when you, instead of giving me the tip of your little finger, as I requested, you offered me two full hands, then, as if exhausted by sensual pleasure, the courage failed me to thank you for this. I immediately sensed that this wasn't about myself and my gratitude, but about your angelic goodness which emanated from you as part of your noble self, to bestow joy on whomsoever. So it was bestowed on myself. But that's no reason for me to feel entitled to thank you. Only the blessing emanating from it can do that, when his successful creation smiles at him. Before I'll become proficient, before I'll be able to express my gratitude towards you, a great deal more has to happed to me. Yes, once I have proved that I carry a sound and capable core within me, once I have acquired a respectable name, once I have become what I wish to be, only then, I know, will I sense a part of that strength within me that would enable me to thank you, through the fact, namely, that I should attribute to you what I had become. For the time being, however, my dear master, I must keep silent on the matter, being of a frail nature that the slightest touch of a finger might crush, I cannot yet offer you a sacrifice. You ask me about Judaism [to Liszt, 18.4.1851] you know of course that the article "Judaism in Music" is by me. Why do you ask then? It was not out of fear, but to prevent the Jews from dragging me down on a purely personal level, that I published pseudonymously. I have harboured a long suppressed resentment against this Jewish business, and this resentment is as necessary to my nature as gall is to the blood. Meyerbeer is a special case, as far as I am concerned: it is not that I hate him, but that I find him infinitely repugnant. This perpetually kind and obliging man reminds me - when he still made a show of protecting me - of the most turbid - I might almost say the most wicked - period of my life. It was a period of wire-pulling and back-staircases, when we were treated like idiots by the patrons whom we inwardly deeply despised. That is a relationship of utter dishonesty: neither party is sincere in his dealings with the other; each assumes an air of devotion, but they use each other only so long as it profits them to do so. I cannot exist as an artist in my own eyes or in those of my friends, I cannot think or feel anything without sensing my total opposition to Meyerbeer, and proclaim it loudly. The balanced judgment of my exalted friend in respect to the Jews [to King Ludwig 22.11.1881] I can only explain by the fact that these people never came into contact with his royal sphere. They remained a notion. Whereas for us they are a real experience. My dealings with several of these people were on a friendly, sympathetic and affectionate basis. But this serves only to support my conviction, because I consider the Jewish race the born enemy of pure humanity and all that is noble in it. That especially we Germans will be the ruined by them, that is certain. And perhaps I am the last German who is able to assert himself against an all-powerful Judaism, as an artist, and hold his ground. Ah ... ah ... ah ... ah ... ah ...
