Why did this guy have to land up right in front of him? Speak softly, man! Will his dad be here? Speak softly, man! Put out the flambeau. Quick! Hey! Lopez, open the door! Open the door! Come on! Just one slap? Yes, just one. That was more than enough! What did he say after slapping you? He asked all of you to go and get your shares! Shall we finish him off? Only those who are brave enough, need to join me. Hey! If he's watching from the light-house, he can see everything within a radius of four to five miles. Remember that he's standing at a height of 125 feet. If you guys set foot in this town, he will know! Son of a bitch! A SOUTHERN BRAWL CASE I wasn't bluffing. I swear! Dad has told me… that Ammini Annan is a lighthouse, that might hit you from any side! If he looks from the top of that building, his eyes would reach everywhere. From Kayikkara lake to Kadaykkavur railway station. Whichever pit they may hide in, he will catch them! If he looks down from a height of 125 feet, everyone else would seem like ants to him! Well, it's the same for him even if he's on the ground. Well, you'd understand the story properly, only if I start from the beginning. A FEW MONTHS BACK He's coming. Yeah I can see that. I'll handle this, man! Trust me. You people have come with a wedding proposal for Susheela, right? Yes. Turn the vehicle around! Get going! Hey! They are in love! He is going to marry her! You don't have to take the trouble of going there. -Get going. -How can you say that? What? What did you say? -Get going! -Who's that? Run away, dude! It's Ammini Annan! Jump into the river if you want to stay alive! Are you… her lover? Let him come with us. He knows the route better than us. I realized his true colors at Sharkkara. He was there with Mattiyoor Shankaran, Pambadi Chandrashekharan, along with Pallikkal Subramanian and Nilaykkal Kochukeshavan. They are all mighty elephants, right? I stared at him, asking him not to embarrass me. As I was holding his tusks, my hands-- The bride is here! Have a good look at her. Don't find faults later. Right? The bride looks good, right? So, did you like her? I'm not asking you. I knew you'd like her. I was asking him. The two of them are thick friends. He only listens to what this fellow says. Even when it comes to marriage, that's how it is. Here, have this. So, did the friend like her? Hey! He's a peon at the Secretariat. He earns a good salary from the Government. That family will prosper. Come here. Stop hanging around with Podiyan, and get yourself a job. Got it? Okay. Forty three! Forty four! Forty five! Stop it, you scoundrel! What's the point in crying now, after being dumbstruck over there? But she was so ruthless. Really! Hey, you brought her snacks last week when she was craving for it, right? And she did this, even before she could shit it out! Who does he think he is? A magistrate? Bloody Ammini! He's too arrogant! Just wait till I take charge as a policeman. I'll put an end to it then! Hey, Prabha! Calm down, dude! I can't bear the fact that he escaped, abandoning me. That's not how it is. He will tell my dad about this. I won't be able to enter my house then. Not just that. If I hadn't run away, he'd have put me in the jeep too. You shameless fellow! Who is he to obey him as soon as he says something? Is he the Almighty? Let it be, Prabha. You were going to lose her anyway. Consider that it happened a little early. Get lost, you loser! Don't irritate me! She's not so neat either. Would she betray you like this otherwise? When you go after women, make sure they have a good heart. Even he has two hands and a soul, right? Yet the poor fellow got trapped. -Anyway, we should get back at him! -Who? -Ammini! -Hey, how is her groom? Get lost, you dog! You didn't show this courage then, right? I found out. He's a peon at the Secretariat. That's why she changed sides. And look at him! Lying here wondering what he'll do in life! For that, we should appreciate Vasanthi. Even if hell breaks loose, she's adamant that she would marry only our Podiyan. That's right. That's how real men deal with women. "I won't agree to this alliance, come what may! I will kill myself! Chacko's eyes dimmed. His hand held tight on to his belt. Mariyamma spoke in a tired voice with fear and helplessness. Don't be so adamant, dear. I will kill myself! Jessie said again." You smell good, Chechi. You can go and sniff that Podiyan! Podiyannan always stinks of Beedi. Does Ammini Annan smell of Beedi too? You can check for yourself today. I don't care! I will go and check, okay? Don't complain later. Read the rest, girl. "The belt flared up in the air, at the same moment. Oh my God!" -Jessie shouted. -Long live! EMS, AKG and Sundaraiyya! Hey, Ammini Annan is here. Only a little bit is left. You can take it with you. Return it tomorrow itself. Long live EMS, AKG and Sundaraiyya! I am leaving. Jaggery. Doesn't she need some light to go? No! She's quite used to walking in the dark. She shouldn't be ashamed to walk in broad daylight, later on. You look as bright as the lighthouse! Come on in! -You got scared, right? -No. You didn't? I didn't. Why didn't you get scared? Who else would come here, other than you? That too, in Ammini Annan's property! Bloody Ammini Annan! Come! Come on! Don't stop! That's enough for today. Keep singing, my dear. If I sing again, the Incubus will come down. Who can be more of an Incubus than me? Podiyan, you little devil! Do that laugh again! -What? -The laugh you did in between the song? Do it again! Laugh a little more! You sound exactly like singer S Janaki! -Look! -Yeah. You need to draw this picture of S Janaki. -I can do that. -And draw Yesudas' picture too. -Simple! -And write… "Thankamani cassettes &amp; musics" in a huge font! Thankamani? What's that, bro? It's my name! I am adamant that I need a cassette shop in my name. Why are you adamant about it? Her sister's husband brought a tape recorder from Persia. She touched it once. Then, her sister told her, "Don't touch it. The song will turn out to be bad" Whose song? Yesudas' song! -What do I say? -Do you know how to draw? I can draw anyone! You can draw it, but people should identify that it's Janaki and Yesudas from your drawing. Why is she talking like this? It's me who has drawn on all the walls of this village. You've seen my drawings, right? She was just kidding. Leave it, man! -Kidding, it seems. -Hey! You've taken money from me before drawing it. I hope you don't run away from the village. My father's name is Pani Pillai. I'll complete the drawing on this wall a day before your deadline, and make sure it's colored as well, okay? You know what's the matter? I need to open the shop before new year's. You can open it, bro! Your wall! Your shop! Kottappalli Panicker has given us an auspicious time. Do you know what he said? Oh God! Ammini Annan! He said that I'm going to have the best time in my life, as per astrology. Hey! What is it, bro? -Come here! -Yeah. This is a fortune that a person gets, once in 75 years. If I start the shop I will be super success… The siren is a sign that it's true, right? -You are so lucky, bro! -Enough! Go and draw it! -I'll start right away. -Start the scooter. Hey! Draw it quickly! Minimol, do you want candy? I don't want it. Minimol, I need to tell you something. -I don't want to hear it. -Minimol! I need to reach there before 8:00 a.m. Where are you off to? To Varkala. Has the SKV bus left? No, it'll be here anytime soon. -Hey look! It's Chandrika! -Where are you going? Get lost! My peacock oil is perfect for all kinds of relief. For attractive eyes and the stimulus of nerves and veins. Peacock oil! Welcome! If you're going to Varkala, you'll be late to get back, right? -Get lost! -Who will light the lighthouse? Pani Pillai is in town. He will do it. Pillai, get me some quicklime. The quicklime is over there, girl. Where are you going, Annan? Why do you care? You're always angry at me. But there's a lot of love for me in his heart! I know that! Stop irritating him and mind your own business. Anna! You just have to nod! I won't let anyone approach me thereafter! What is it this time, Chandran? What is it? Tell us! Is it an elephant's tusk? -A wild bull's hide? -An elk's head? Show it! The one who gave that madman a government job should be slapped. He got that job because his dad died on duty, right? Every time he comes, he will bring the skin or thorns of some wild animal. Who imagined that he'd bring a live porcupine? You don't need any other medicine. There will be a slight pain. It will go away in some time. Pakki, did Usha leave yet? Usha didn't come, Vasanthi did. Oh! How's that useful to me? In the end, will he dump you? Podiyannan? Me? No way! -Go ahead! -Yeah go for it! -Go on! -Our fate is to sit as guards here. Don't tell Mom. I'll be a little late. Wow, those eyes Like a spear that's piercing my heart Don't kill me with Your sharp stares and drink my blood Blood is gushing within me Overflowing with love It's not breast-milk Don't be hungry for it It's midnight, my girl You are like hot arrack, my darling It's so much fun To roam around the streets I'm an out of control bicycle Hop on if you want to Wow, those eyes Like a spear that's piercing my heart Don't kill me with Your sharp stares and drink my blood It's midnight, my girl You are like hot arrack, my darling It's so much fun To roam around the streets I'm an out of control bicycle Hop on if you want to Why are you baffled Who are you? How dare you cross the limits? Who are you? So handsome You are like the crimson red sun During twilight Come with me Standing under the shade of The mushrooms sprouted in the fresh rains We killed so much time For so many days, my dear froggie You are my snake who's out of control Podiyan is so full of love Wow, those eyes Like a spear that's piercing my heart Don't kill me with your sharp stares And drink my blood Blood is gushing within me Overflowing with love It's not breast-milk don't be hungry for it It's midnight, my girl You are like hot arrack, my darling It's so much fun To roam around the streets I'm an out of control bicycle Hop on if you want to Who is it? Ammini Annan! You go home! Son of a gun! How dare you enter my house for this debauchery? How dare you touch me? You're so horny that you can't wait for some more time? Anna! -Who is it? -Your Daddy! I'll get back at you later! Go, do this nonsense in your own house! She and her lover didn't find any other place to satiate their lust! Let the sun rise! I'll break their legs! Anna! Let's go inside! Don't announce it to the people at night! Let them know! Let the entire town know it. Bloody son of a bitch is trying to screw around! Anna, just come with me. Listen to me! -What should I listen to? -Don't disgrace those kids. Go to bed! They should have thought of the disgrace while doing it. -Just go inside! -Don't touch me! Both of them must have been horny. Couldn't they wait for the right moment to do this? -Their families should be blamed. -He got a royal pounding, apparently. He has lost a couple of teeth too. This was the actual beginning of the troubles. A news spreading in Anchuthengu is like… waves of the sea during a storm. The matter passed on from the tip of one Beedi to another, and spread all over town, including shops and houses. Hey, Chellappan Pillai! Isn't anybody home? Are you hiding inside the house? Dad is lying on the bed. You've made him bedridden. We can't step out in peace now. Is that why you came all the way here? I don't have anything to tell you. Call your dad! What is it, Uncle? What are you guys gossiping about out here? Is there any end to the gossips when there are naughty kids in the family? Well, she has said that she'd marry only him, right? He just tried getting a taste, a little early. That's all, right? Why do the people care about it? Getting a taste? Uncle, come and sit inside. Uncle, just listen to me. What's done is done! You should all go there, forgetting the animosity. I'll ask Annan to go to Podiyan's house and talk to them. If Vasanthi's father is hesitant, her Uncle can go, right? You will be quite tactful. All of you think about it. Hey! If you do it on the washing stone, won't your back hurt? Who bothers about pain and injuries at that moment? Since you didn't bother then, it has become a bother for you now! I had warned him not to get into this relationship. She cares for Rukmini, much more than him. Even if he marries her, Vasanthi is not going to leave Rukmini. He will have to go and stay there then. A guy who lives in his wife's house is as worthless as a street dog! Who will be your neighbor then? Ammini Pillai! Will you have any value there? Couldn't you take a stick out of that fence and beat him with it? Tell me? I don't want it. Take it away. I was about to hit him. That's when she came. His wife! He didn't show this decency, right? He should be destroyed! We must destroy him! I am with you! I don't need anyone. I will finish this on my own. The case is such! He also has two hands and a soul, right? You must do something. He's causing trouble to each one of us. Just wait until I take charge. I will frame him! Well, Podiyan, what are you going to do now? Shall we bring goons from Attingal? I can ask my uncle's son. He's a famous rowdy over there. We don't need any rowdies from outside. Podiyan will settle the scores himself. Before I marry her, I will hit Ammini Pillai back! Ammini Annan agreed to conduct your wedding, right? So, is that necessary? Who is he to conduct my wedding? My dad?! He has always been a scaredy-cat. He thinks Ammini would eat him up! Bro! You should slap him hard on his face! He gave my Susheela away to some random guy. He must be thrashed! Bloody dog! Son of a bitch! What you did was right. If you conduct it yourself, you'll receive those blessings. I don't want anything in return. -Things should go well, that's all. -Yeah. He wasn't ready to come for the engagement. He agreed only because his mother begged him to. He's quite proud that way. Well, he's just loitering around, right? Will he be able to do a job and run a family? His family is well-off, right? Yeah. And the girl is smart. She'll put a lash on him. That's right! Hey, stand here. Keep this near the lamp. What? Stop it! Keep it closer. All of you don't crowd around. Move away. -Uncle, please come. -Yeah. Seek his blessings. Be blessed! Look how he's trying to rule over the whole function! Let the function get over. The father may come forward. Touch his feet. Here you go. Now, the mother. Now, the groom can step forward. Stand to the east. Stand to the east! He doesn't even know where's east or west. The groom's father can come forward. Why are you barging in? Move aside! I invited them! No matter who has invited them, they should have some common sense. Hold this. Show me your hand! Give me your hand! It's not time for the ritual yet. Much bigger rituals are already over. And yeah, I don't need anyone's benevolence to start living with her. But she's adamant that she will come to my house, only if I marry her! Once you know the time and date of the wedding, tell me. I will come and marry you! What's wrong with you? You want to rule, wherever you go! What? I only spoke facts, right? Yeah, right! Please speak these facts only where it's necessary. Don't keep spitting these facts everywhere! Giving people a reason to talk unnecessarily! Mani, once the white paint dries up tomorrow, draw the columns. Do not make me give you a reminder again. Hey! You're still painting it white? My dear bro, I am working on it. Just be calm! Bring it here. Why are you looking at him? You won't do any work! -Hey, Chandrika! -Get lost! He is back! Brothers and sisters, please come. If you're struck by porcupine thorns, or stung by a wild wasp, bit by a scorpion, or a poisonous spider, touched by itchy plants or any such pains, wounds, itchy sensations or burning sensations. Here's an instant cure and remedy for all these. The extremely special, extremely rare, prepared using traditional concoctions, this panacea. My peacock oil! Please come and buy it. Experience the qualities of this special medicine. This is not fake or magic. It's a tradition of centuries. The mic got stuck! Hey Chandran! What is it? Open it! -Look! -What is it? What is it? Don't worry! Whatever happens, I have the cure for it. -Oh no! -Run away! -It's a snake! -Run away! Chandran is absolutely bonkers! He won't allow us to live in peace. Where the hell are you looking? It's a King Cobra! We'll die even if it hisses. Run away! Move away! Is it enough if it only sees the Kulathuppuzha jungle? Let it see our village too! Don't go there, ma'am! -There's a snake! -What is it? -Which snake? -King Cobra! We'll die even if it looks at us. Don't go there. -Come on! -Don't go there. -It's really venomous! -Hey -Hey, girl! -Ma'am! Podiyanna! -He brought a Cobra! -What? He brought a King Cobra! What is it? -He brought a King Cobra to the market. -Who? The forest guard, Chandran. He brought a King Cobra from the jungle and created a ruckus at the market. Let's go there. Who hired this idiot into the forest department? Who knows! Hey, Podiya! Shall we catch it? I'm not coming. You guys can go and catch it. Hey! If we take the initiative to catch it now, you can be a hero! Podiyanna, come on. Let's go and catch it. There are a lot of people there. Come on! Dude, they have a point. You are totally disgraced in town already. Shall we go and catch it? -Shall we? -Let's go, bro! All of us can go together. It will be fun. -Come on, then. Let's catch it. -Come on, guys! Why are you pushing me? I'm also standing here to see it. This is such a nuisance. If we don't kill it, it will start breeding here. -Is it? -Yes. Where is he? We need to give him a good pounding. What the hell has he done! Well, he is a government official. If you lay hands on him, it will be a big issue. Bro, is the snake big or small? You have a tape, right? Try measuring it. Give it to him. He will measure it. Move! Move away. Move! -Hey! Move! -Get out of our way! Move! We've come to catch the snake! -Come on, move! -Get out of our way! -Where's the snake? -Move! -Calm down! Move! -Where is it? -Right there! -Move! Move! Hey! Take him home! -It's a snake! -Let him see the snake! -I can see its tail! -What? I can see its tail, dude! Move! Can we catch it? Let's try smoking it out. We'll kill it when it comes out. -Can you see it? -Look! Stop looking at her and look at the snake! -Chechi, come here. -There it is! Podiyan, it's right there! Catch it! It's right there! Come on, pull it out! -What is he doing? -Can you please stop screaming? It's right there! Yelling won't kill it! Look! It's him! Ask him not to do it. Let him catch it, Chechi. He won't give us the kerosene. Grab his collar and get it from him. Everyone's anxious out here. What the hell is wrong with him? Get something! We need some smoke! And some garlic as well. We need to inform the forest department. My dear sir, the snake doesn't care about the law. Please move! Nonsense! You stay here! -Bro, he's coming. -Who? Ammini Annan. -Who? -Ammini Annan is coming. Yeah, that's just what we needed. Let him come. Let him see us catching the snake! Ammini Anna is here! Move! What is this? What are you guys doing? We'll do it ourselves. You need not interfere. Throw the leaf ribs on to it. You're gaping? Where is the snake? It's in between the husks, Anna! Move. Hey! It's a King Cobra! It can kill you even with a hiss. Don't push, Dad. The snake will bite you! Go home, Dad! You go home first. -Move! -Stop pushing! You saw the snake, right? Now move away. Don't step on my foot. So much of preparation and planning to catch this little snake? What is he doing? Look! It's the tail. Hey, Ammini! -Anna! -Ammini! -Anna! -Careful! Stop it, Anna! Anna! Anna! The snake! Run away! -Run! -Run! O dear mother of God! Run for your lives! -Oh my God! -Run! Run for your lives! -Move away! -Run! -Chechi! -Let go of me! -Move, Kunjukunju! -It's coming! Run! He is crazy. He is tossing it around! Podiyanna, your lungi. Run into the shop! Anna! -Run, guys! -Run! The snake is dead! The snake is dead! The snake is dead! Ammini Annan has killed the snake! I was really scared, Chechi. The guy who came to catch the snake had to run away without clothes or undergarments! Be it a snake or a tiger, it's all the same for Ammini Annan! You're going east, right? -Yes. -Okay. You won't live long. Hey! So are we doing it tomorrow? It'll go cold if we keep delaying it. Bro! There's no point in going to him bare handed. I'm telling you. Shouldn't we get some weapons? Dude, we are five! We don't need weapons. Podiyanna! My father told me something long back. On the day of the temple festival at Varkala, during the procession, someone groped Thekkecheri Shanthi Chechi. He was part of the old Arukolachami gang. Annan started pounding him. Their side had a swarm of people. It went on for 45 minutes! Annan stood there and thrashed them for 45 minutes! By the time others joined from Anchuthengu, those guys were taken to the hospital. Do you know that? What? 45 minutes! Yes. Yeah, right! As if he was recording it with a stop-watch. -Get lost. -You get lost! My dad told me about this. That was 20 years back, right? That's right. But only his body has aged. His grit is still stronger than ever! Or else, why would he beat a King Cobra to death? Shall we get some weapons? Keep something handy. Okay. Something made of iron. Yeah, right. 45 minutes, it seems! Nonsense! He is coming. Look! He shouldn't be able to identify us, no matter what If he does, we are finished! Hey! No one should utter even a word! He'll identify us through our voices. He is quite drunk, I guess. That's good. It will be useful for us. Yes. It's Gomathi's brew. I hope it doesn't end up like an elephant on a rampage. Don't scare me, you scoundrels. Oh God! Cover your faces! Hey! Catch him! Who are you? Who are you guys? Oh God! Go and catch him Don't let that pig get away! Come, let's go! Come! Come on! Hey you! Just come on! Come quickly! Long live EMS, AKG and Sundaraiyya! Long live EMS, AKG and Sundaraiyya! Has he made a vow to do this every day? He gets drunk and keeps shouting this. He is crazy! I know the first two people. Who's the third person? Sundaran? Who knows! Must be some political leader. Annan should've been home by now, right? Did Gomathi cast her spell on him? Not just her. Even if much more beautiful nymphs try their luck, Annan won't fall for them, my dear. Chandrika was saying at the market the other day, that she won't let anyone approach her, once he nods a yes. -Really? -Yeah! -Really? -Yeah! Chechi! Someone stabbed Ammini Annan at the beach! What? Where is Annan? He was taken to the Mission Hospital. Is he dead? It wasn't such a fatal slash. He might bleed to death if no one sees him there. Get lost! Whatever said and done, you shouldn't have slashed him. Scoundrel! Imagine what would've happened if I hadn't! We'd all be lying in our graves now. Just like I said, he was on a rampage! The cops will come anyway. Allah! I will lose my job! Damn it! Must be true. What? I think it was more than 45 minutes. -Chechi, wait! -Let go of me! Let go of me. I want to see my husband! -They won't let us inside. -Don't make noise here. -Can't you understand? -Get lost! You can't go inside now. You should wait here. -What's the commotion? -Doctor, they… -are not listening to me. -Hey! The wounds on the patient are not so deep. He just needs some stitches. Don't create a ruckus. Just stay calm. Sister, please tell them. Go and sit there. -Go, sit there. -Chechi, come with me. Those who did this to my husband will rot in hell! Don't curse them unnecessarily. How are you? I am fine, sir. Who slashed you? It was really dark. Even if I say it, it won't stand in court, sir. Did you hear their voices? Like the voices of someone familiar? No, sir. Even if I take a guess, the case won't be strong, sir. The case becomes strong based on how we report it. Well, do you suspect anyone? Any pre-existing grudge? No, sir. There's no need for a case, sir. I can't waste my time running around for that. Even if you don't, we have to intervene when there's an issue in town, right? We will report a case saying that it was done by some unidentified strangers. Come. Why did you say so? Yeah! I was going to ask the same thing. I have to see those guys in future too. So, you don't care? Well, I will settle the scores myself, one by one. Hey Pakki! Come, this way. This way? He scared me! Hey! -What's the situation? -Nothing that we feared of. He just has five to six stitches. -Where are they? -They are inside. Come. Careful. After the cops came? He asked the cops not to file a case. Why did he say so? That's good in a way. Or my job would be in trouble. Since he doesn't want a case, it's good that we step out. If we stay away, everyone will suspect us. I thought so too. What do you say, bro? He would've anyway realized that it was us. If it becomes a case, everyone will know. And that would bring shame to him, right? Maybe that's why he didn't say anything to the cops. Anyway, we need to keep an eye on him. He shouldn't dare to do anything again! Eighteen, nineteen, twenty. Who do you think would have done it? Who knows! I heard some rumors. Give me the rest of the change, Chechi. Whoever has done it, they will have to pay for it. What's up, dear? Nothing! You don't want popadams, right? Last week's stock isn't over yet. Oh, okay. Don't forget to buy my popadams for your wedding! She keeps throwing taunts all the time! How is Annan doing? He is still in pain. But he won't show it, right? I came here to make some rice for him. I'd like to come there. But when I think of facing Annan… What have you done? People will talk! Chechi… did Annan say that he doesn't want a case? Yeah! He has some other plans in mind. It's us women who've lost our peace of mind. Hey! What about the money? I'll pay, brother. Don't irritate me. I hope you pay some day. Stop! Get me a pack of Beedis. -What? -Beedi! Hey! Where were you guys missing for the past couple of days? We had gone for a movie yesterday. On our way back, we stayed over at Kunjukunju's Uncle's place. Pakki, you heard what happened, right? Yeah. Hey! Where is Lopez? About Ammini Annan, right? I heard people talking about it. He is fine, right? Yes, he is. -Where is Lopez? -He must be at home. We went for a movie at Kollam yesterday and came back only at noon today. -Right? -Yeah. What kind of a guy is he? He hasn't drawn the pictures even after taking money from me. The astrologer from Kottappally had fixed an auspicious date. I want to open my shop! -Just tell him. -Go, tell him yourself! Not just telling him, I know how to make him do it, as well. Hey! Heard that you guys were in hiding? Is it true? Why should we hide? -Why? Don't you dare speak nonsense! -Hey! Don't create a ruckus! Since you guys were missing yesterday, some people have a doubt. That's why he said so. Hey! Pay for the soda. Random people pop up, to speak nonsense! I was just joking, man! You don't need to joke now. I'll get your picture drawn! We're going to inquire who's spreading these rumors. We'll settle you after that. There were different conjectures all over Anchuthengu. Some people say that Annan knows who did it. Some others say that Annan has calmed down with this. These guys are the culprits! I am sure! Let Annan get discharged from the hospital. He will come like the raging July sea, said some others. Anyway, we decided that we're not going to land in front of him ourselves. Like the Gemini star At midnight Like Goddess Parvati In Lord Parameshwar Like Rukmini in Lord Krishna Like butter in milk Like kohl on the eyes I am a girl who's engrossed in my Annan I am a girl who's engrossed in my Annan Adorning the embers Of the Gemini star on your crown Stand guard, O midnight Carry the ocean of love In thousands of palms And give us a bath, O daylight Smouldering like ember Wet like the ocean You are within me, and outside me You are my world, you are my heaven I am a girl who's engrossed in my Annan I am a girl who's engrossed in my Annan Like the Gemini star At midnight Like Goddess Parvati In Lord Parameshwar Like Radha in Lord Krishna Like butter in milk Like kohl on the eyes I am a girl who's engrossed in my Annan I am a girl who's engrossed in my Annan Was Lopez part of that group? Why do you ask so? It's been a month since I've seen him being normal. He's always playing hide and seek. Like he's terrified of something. Let me see him first. I won't feel bad if you hit him. But still, he's a young chap. What do I want? What do I want? My… Anna… Where are you going? Over there. To paint. Get up! You and your drawing! -Let me see how you draw! -Anna, please! No! Anna, please don't hurt me. Anna, please don't hurt me. Something will happen here today, right bro? Don't hit me! Anna, I beg you! Please let me go! -Please don't hurt me. -Did these guys attack him? Please don't hurt me. -Time for a fight! -Let me go! Please, Ammini Anna! No, Anna! Anna, no! Please! Anna… Nice. Now, draw as I say! In full detail! Anna, please! I need to open this shop before new year. You know what forget it. That can wait. Should I tell you what to draw? Write it, you son of a gun! Write the names of all the guys who attacked me! Paint? Maniya! Po… di… yan. Podiyan. Ku… nju… kunju… Kunjukunju? Yes! Kunjukunju! Ku… ttan. Prabhakkuttan. I think I can set up a camp here. Seems like my business will flourish! Ku… nji… pakki. Kunjippakki. Write down your name as well. So, these are the culprits. I'm assuming all of you saw it, right? You can strike off your name now. Okay. Hey! With red paint! Red? Hey! Your score is settled. Get up! I said get up! I stopped here considering your father. Is it shaking? -Is it paining? -Yes. It will pain! Now, you can go and tell the other bastards! In broad daylight… in front of an audience, they should come, meet me… and get their shares from me. Understood? Okay. This is Annan's style. Dad used to say that… Annan's rage is like a monitor lizard's grasp. You may think that Annan got those names written on the wall of a shop. But it's not like that. It was written on the hearts of all the people of Anchuthengu. Rotten scoundrels! Oh dear Goddess! Please give health and long life to Ammini Annan… so that he may beat these four unfortunate guys before the new year! Oh God, please protect me! Oh my ancestors who were born and lived on the land extending from the mountains in the east to the ocean in the west! Please separate the rice from the chaff! Look. Do you see this? The coconut got shattered into eight pieces. -Eight equal parts! -Is that so? So, it's confirmed. It will happen before the new year, right? No, it won't happen. -Oh no! -Yes. If you could do something extreme… Ammini won't get affected by it. -Not for Ammini! -Then? -For them. -Oh! If we could get those four guys to get a couple of slaps, Ammini Annan will allow me to open my shop. -Let us try that way. -Okay. Devi, Kali, Maha… Hey, I'm doing this for you not me! So, close your eyes and pray. You do your part and God will do the rest. -Go ahead! Pray. -Okay. Devi, Kali, Karinkali, please protect us! Shall we finish him off? Only those who are brave enough, need to join me. Your wedding is in three months, bro. Before that… Before that? Isn't it better to surrender before that? Or else? Or else, we should finish him off. Whatever you're planning, don't count me in for it. Oh yeah. Your case is closed, right? He won't dare to touch me after two days. Oh, you will be a big shot policeman, right? Of course! He will have to eat jail food if he touches me. -Hey, Kunjippakki. -Yes. You got the job because Ammini Annan did not file a police complaint. Just keep that in mind. This issue will be solved now if you go and get a slap from him. Kunjippakki might go get slapped. But, policeman Kunjippakki… will never get slapped! Wait till I put on that police hat. I will beat his intestines out! Hey Podiya! You don't have to be scared. I will organize your wedding with police protection. If he touches a cop, there will be a route march! I am saying this to everyone here. It's only as painful as an ant bite. It will all be over before you know it. Get lost! Shameless fellow! Hey! If he's watching from the light-house, he can see everything within a radius of four to five miles. Remember that he's standing at a height of 125 feet. If you guys set foot in this town, Annan will know it. You must have understood the state of affairs now, right? This is why I said this at the beginning. Whichever ditch they may hide in, Annan will catch them! Wonder what will happen next! Hey! -Were you vigilant when you came here? -Yes. He must have settled down for the night. Eat something before you leave. I said no, right? Come on, man! Come on! Bye, auntie. See you later. -Have you packed everything? -Yes. -Will you leave tonight itself? -Maybe. -Be careful. -Okay. -Wait a minute. -What is it? Go and meet him before you leave. Don't get him flustered. It is Ammini. He will do as he says. You mind your own business, Dad. I'm not going to get slapped by him. Get it done with before you become a policeman. That shame will wear off in two days. That's not the case, after you become a policeman. He won't do squat! This guy is not my Dad. He is his Dad. Come on, man! Let me return as a policeman. Ammini and his fans will see my true colors then. Oh God! Oh no! It's just a palm leaf. Why did you get scared? I didn't get scared. You did. -Get lost! You were scared. -No, you did. Come along if you are scared. Return back in the morning. Never mind. You can go, bro. How long can we live in fear? Yeah, right. Hey! Look over there! Don't go there. Wait. Is it him? Who? Are you going to the opposite shore? Run! Are you abandoning me, you dog? Throw the torch away and run, you pig! Run quickly, man! Oh my God! Oh, dear Lord! Oh God! -Why did you run first? -You ran first, right? Get lost! It was you who ran first. -Get lost! You ran first! -It was you. -He ran first. -You ran first… Ammini! Oh no! I'll come back in my uniform, to beat your intestines! Ammini, you dog! I'll pound you hard if you try to play tricks. Anna! The thing is… shall I tell you something? None of my blows landed on your body. All were wasted! When you take up some task, you should do it well, right? Do you want to see how it should be done? Do you want to see? -Anna… -Don't close the shops! Ammini Annan has caught one of them! Don't close the shops! Don't close the shop, Unni Anna! Ammini Annan is bringing Prabha here. Keep walking. Don't beat me, Anna. You ambushed me in the dark. Oh no! -I will thrash you in front of everyone. -Please don't hit me. Anna! Please let me go, Anna. Anna, I am too naive, right? Please don't beat me, Anna. Oh my God! Susheela! You are lucky, my dear. The shop is not closed. Shall we buy Ghee-Pancakes? -Shall we? -No need. Enough, Anna. Oh, no! Blood! I am bleeding! Isn't this enough? Get lost! Tell your main man! If he wants to get married at the right time, ask him to come and get slapped before that. Look! He is coming. Calm down. Don't make a scene. -Get down, Ikka. -I'll talk to him. Prabha's relatives are here. Yeah, they must be upset. Don't pick a fight, alright? How are you? We were waiting to meet you. I have fed you with my own hands! So what? I'd love it if you'd feed me again. But… how could you do this to him? See this? This is your son's gift. The scar won't fade. I can at least try to wipe it off my mind. Go on, man. Go. -I'm feeling better. -Really? Like I've won my freedom back. I had told you, right? You were the first one to attack me then. How was it? He stretched his hands and slapped me on my cheeks! I thought my face was ripped apart. Not many people saw it when you were slapped, right? The entire town was watching when I was thrashed! I was lucky that way. Only four people saw it. There were none who knew me. -Is that so? -Yes. -Don't lie! -I swear on my mother! Careful when you step down. He wouldn't have felt so good about it. -Why? -There were not many spectators, right? Okay. Wonder what would be the fate of the others now! Why are you sighing? They should go in front of him. That's all, right? Now they have to live in fear and also get beaten up! Slowly! Careful when you climb. They will be starving there. You need some guts to get beaten up in front of people. They don't have it. He should have just filed a case then. We needn't have suffered like this then. What suffering? We have to hide here without food and water, right? Then, go ahead and get slapped! Go to hell! He considers me as an outsider even now. The slaps won't be mild at all! Heard that Susheela and her husband are in town now? -Get lost! I don't want to see her. -Why? Get down. Put it on the stand. Here they come. Hey! Come quickly! Don't shout, you scoundrel! Move your ass. My stomach is growling. We are coming, right? Careful. Shame on you! Coming back here after getting slapped? Best! Only because we got slapped, you guys are getting food on time. And I have peace of mind now. But you've lost your honor, you schmuck! It's just honor. I don't mind losing it. It will grow back later. -Give it to me. -Take it. Just give it, man! My intestines are cursing me! Oh God! Hey! Have you come to a decision? How long can you stay here? We have decided to go to Varkala tonight. I am going to Attingal anyway. Shall we get goons from there? He has asked you to get slapped early on, if you want to marry on time. Podiyan should be reborn as a loser to get married after being slapped by him! What I am saying is that… it's better to surrender. It's only as painful as an ant bite. It will be over before you know it. Yeah! I will kill him! There is still a lot of time left for the wedding. Are you saying that people would notice my bump? The child is not anyone else's, right? Good. At least you are sure about that! Very good! Shouldn't we inform him? I have to tell him. He is in hiding, right? Do you know where he is hiding? I don't know, Chechi. Ask Annan to finish it before January. The North Indian officer will be coming for inspection. Make something tasty to have along with rice. So, what you're having now is not tasty? -When is he coming? -Maybe this week. Okay. She will take all the chilies with her! Hey, watch her closely. She is pregnant. Did he come again? He doesn't have to come everyday for that to happen, right? When she walks in for the wedding, she will be four months pregnant. It won't show in four months. Yeah, right! She doesn't care even if it shows. What's the point of the wedding anyway? You already conducted their wedding once, right? Announcing it to everyone! Some salt, please. He is not here? -Did you get scared? -Get lost! How is your stay over here? What do I say? Did you come here directly? Yes. Why did you ask? Would he come sniffing after you? Instead of living in fear, can't you settle the issue by getting slapped? This makes no sense. Why have you come now? Vasanthi asked me to give this to you. -Did you tell her that I am here? -No. She asked me to give it to you if I see you. Period… Missed… -Maybe she misses you a lot. -What? Missed period… -Something must have gone missing! -Get lost! No, what else? Missed period… Oh! Anna, missed the period! She missed her period! Did you get it? She missed her periods! Yes, that is it. Yes, think about it. Now you can't postpone the wedding even if you want to. You are trapped now. Where were you all these days? Are you fine? What is your intention? I am planning to stay at Pakki's camp for a few days. I didn't mean that! Why, girl? Don't you trust me? Only a few days are left for the wedding. So what? Ammini Annan… I will handle all that. Let Pakki return. Why did you do that to Annan? I'll leave. You go to bed. Don't go! I will come out. It's all right. Gopalanna, it's been a while since the last fight. Nothing happened after that. I think Podiyan and gang fled from the village. Kunjippakki escaped, since he has gone for training. How will he escape? Ammini has to spare him, right? But will Ammini try to mess with the police? As if he's some mighty police officer! He wears the police uniform even when he goes to take a dump at home. Haven't you left yet? When I was about to leave, there was a call from the stomach. That's due to fear! That guy… Hey! He does not know the power of the police. If he touches me, there'll be a route march! Move aside, Mom. Give me a bar soap and 250 grams yam-vine. Give me two kilograms of biriyani rice. When did you return? What? I mean, when did you come, "Sir"? Good. -Yesterday. -Okay. Get the rice. Hey! Get two kilograms of biriyani rice for sir. -Yes, bro. -Get these as well. Half kilograms of onions, along with 250 grams sugar, and 300 grams peas. Cinnamon stick, clove, cardamom… Ammini! Give this to Panippilla when he comes, Anna. Okay. -Slap! -What? -I mean rice! -Okay. Make it fast. Hey, make it fast. -Getting it. -Sir is in a hurry to leave. -Here it is. -Enough. Dad will come and take the rest. Give it. If you wait a little bit more, you can collect "everything" and go! Did you see him leave? This is not kept on my head for showing off! If anyone touches me, there will be a route march! What is this route march, Anna? I am a policeman. So what? Mom is at home. She's waiting to prepare Biriyani. If you run, I will chase you and hit you. -Remove your hat. -I won't. -Remove your hat! -No, please! If you touch a cop, there will be a route march! Consider this as payback for those twenty stitches, you son of a gun! You and your bloody route march! Oh my God! Anna… give the keys to Panippilla when he comes. -Move! -Make way for Annan! It's done! Why is there a crowd here? -Stop it! -Hey, look at him! How long has it been since I asked you for biriyani rice? I don't need your rice any more. The poor guy became decent when he got beaten up! Come, sir Can't do it. Push! Push and go! Hey! How was it? Nothing. I stood there like a rock. His hand must have hurt a lot! Anyway, there were a lot of spectators for both of us, right? Mine had just four spectators. But how could he slap him while he was in police uniform? Won't you be able to bring some cops? -Yeah, right! -That can be done easily. But Mom won't allow it. -What? -That's right. Mom told me not to complicate things any further. Come to think of it, she has a point. What did you say? Podiya… Prabha and Lopez are right. You can't postpone your wedding anyway. So, what I am saying is that… the wise thing to do is to surrender. It's only as painful as an ant bite. It will be over before you know it. Stop it! Hey, stop the car! -Get out, you bastards! -Here? Go on a route march from here. Shameless fellows! -We are almost there. -We can walk. -How will we go? -He made us get out from his Dad's car. We will also buy a car. Yeah, dream on! Since he's a North Indian, don't make it too spicy. Okay. Deep fry some of it. Make a curry with the rest of it. Do you have to leave now itself? Yes, after taking a bath. Your wife cooks fish very well, right? -Yes, good fish fry. -Oh, great! -Enough. -Get the towel. Here you go. Please come in. It's not good. You don't make it tasty when there are guests. Where's the fish fry? I didn't fry it. I just made the curry. Didn't I ask you to fry it before leaving? I have to be dressed up and also make 100 dishes! Where's the time for all this? I invited him over saying that there will be fish fry. Did I ask you to tell him that? You never do what I ask you to do. You always do as you please! If I ask you to fry it, you must fry it! If he's so particular about it, ask him to wait for some time. I will take some from this and fry it. No honorable man will ask someone who has washed his hands to wait! Is that so? So much honor! Then what should I do? Take this and pour it over your head! Here, pour it! If there is anything left, pour it over his head as well. I am done! I am done living in this house! Ma'am… Come in. She is inside. Hey, Ammini is here. Go and see him. I don't want to see anyone. -Hey, lower your voice! -He is standing over there. What you did was a bit too much. I didn't think it through. It just happened. She'll be adamant too, right? Anna! Are you sleeping, Anna? Ammini Annan is like a mountain standing against the rough sea. People of Anchuthengu have never seen Ammini Annan being shaken. Dad used to say that they are like Lord Shiva and Parvathy. When Rukmini Chechi left, Annan lost his vigor. It's been a couple days, right? Can't you come back now? I haven't decided anything. You know Annan's nature very well, right? Can't you forgive him? I know how to make a spicier fish curry. This issue will be over if I make it and pour it over his head. Why did you leave the house then? Only a few days are left for the marriage, right? Right now, Annan's mind is a little stirred up. He will forget about the revenge. That way, the marriage will happen. I don't care what happens after that. Chechi, you are really something! Let my quarrel be of some use to you. Annan is really weak now. In the heat of her full bosom To hide… Get inside quickly! Hey, did you hear about it? -What? -I think he has forgotten about it. Really? I bumped into him this morning. Though he saw me, he didn't even mind me. When I said something, he left without saying a word. He wouldn't have recognized you. That's not the case. His wife left him. Who? Rukmini? Something big has happened. She did not return even after he went and called her back. Anyway his hood has shrunk a bit. Bro, this is the right time. My Uncle's house is nearby. Shall I call Gopi and his team? Since the enemy is weak now, our job is easy. Do you want anything severe? What does that mean? It may even lead to death. But, that will be more expensive. -No need for that now. -Then what? He shouldn't be able to raise his hand on me. It will not rise. His hands and legs won't rise. Goddess! He will be brought under our control. This Panicker is not worshiping any mere Gods! He will be brought in front of me. He will be brought to this doorstep. Okay. Oh my Goddess! Oh no! Death on wheels! -He is here. -Who? Ammini! Wait! Go inside, not outside! Or he'll beat me up as well. Go! God, I think he will rip me apart today. Come inside. Go inside… I mean, come inside. Panicker. Well, I need a solution. Both of you are on separate paths, right? It's been a week now. It's like I am paralyzed on one side. What is the birth star? -What? -Your wife's birth star. -"Thiruvathira". -Thiruvathira. That is a tough one. She won't come back easily. But she has to come back, right? If not, we'll bring her back! Woman's seduction spell. Since it is your own wife whom you have to seduce, only a minor procedure is required. -You can do it, right? -Yes. I will come to your house in the evening then. That's where she has to come back, right? -Okay then. -Okay. Wait. Since it's for you, I am not delaying it. Let us do it tonight itself. -Okay. -Okay. You may leave now. Oh my Goddess! God, you saved me! I sent him away quickly because you were inside. Now, you take a seat. Let me see what can be done for you. Let my case wait for now. What? I will tell you what to do with his case. But how… I will pay extra money for that. Now, that sounds good! Moreover, nowadays God goes only where the money is. Come now. Kali, Mahakali, Rudrakali, Bhadrakali! Please save us. Pillai, after midnight, wear a towel and pour four buckets of water over your head. After that, wear this amulet around your waist. Then, this Vermilion powder. Apply it on your forehead, neck and chest. Go and call her after that. She will come with you. By calling, I mean… just go and knock at her bedroom door. She will come along with you. Will she come? Even others' wives will come. So, why wouldn't your own wife come? Well, should I go at night itself? The seduction spell was chanted 1001 times to prepare this amulet. I am sure. It will happen! The first woman you see will come along with you. So how can you do it during the day? That is why I told you to go at night. Don't change the wet clothes. And don't speak hereafter. Okay? You can do all that after you get back here. -Did you understand all that I told you? -Yes. Oh Goddess, please protect me! Are there people at the docks? Yes. I want to see him standing naked in front of the villagers. Okay. Hey! Stop there! -Hey! -Catch him! -Thief! -Thief! Come quickly! He's a thief! Catch him! Who is it at this odd hour? Anna! What are you doing here at this hour? Give me a Lungi. What is going on? What is it, Anna? What happened? Don't go there now, Anna. What is it? -Thief! -Thief! -Thief! -Tie him up! It's not a thief. This is Ammini! Look, bro. It's Chandrika's Lungi. No wonder his wife left him! Annan is really worried. Will his worry go away if you guard him? Why have you shut all these doors and windows? Have you eaten anything? There are some rice balls made for breakfast. I will make some coffee. Go! Just go! Panicker gave me an amulet. Wearing it, I was on my way to call you back. Yeah, right! As if I believed that you went to see her! Your reputation is ruined. You've lost your honor in the village, as well. Go and take a bath first. Toddy from the morning batch must have arrived at Thekkumthara toddy shop. Go and have three bottles of it. If anyone smiles at you… with that incident in mind, beat them up! In future, no one should dare to tell this story… either in your presence or your absence. When you beat them up, you should be that ruthless! Most probably, Chandrika will start living in Ammini Pillai's house. Now that the villagers know about it, why should they be scared? They can do whatever they want. Come. He has arrived. Remember what I told you. He should be bedridden. Leave that to me. He should be bedridden for at least six months. Okay. Hey! I heard that someone went for a visit somewhere yesterday. Yes. Bro, it is my aunt's daughter's naming ceremony. -I will see you later. -Okay. Last night, did you see what I went there for? I heard it from someone. If you try to do this loose talk in front of me based on hearsay ever again, I will finish you off, you dog! Consider this as a warning for everyone! Do you know where Chandrika's house is? Do you know? Go there quickly and ask her to come to the junction. Make it fast! You can do as you please. But we're not supposed to say anything! Who do you think you are? Brother, when you come to a village to beat someone up, shouldn't you at least inquire about whom you're supposed to beat up? Oh, God! The stormy sea is coming With the waves polished On the rocks in its pocket The cyclone is coming The dark clouds are coming announcing Their arrival with the lightning The wild hurricane is coming The wild hurricane is coming Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Wow! That was fun! Oh, God! Anna! Tell everyone what happened that night. Annan came to my house at night. He knocked on my door. When I opened the door, he asked for a Lungi. I gave it to him. As I heard the noise outside, I warned him not to step out. But he didn't listen to me. He left immediately. That's all that happened. All of you heard her, right? You were the one who identified the Lungi, right? Anna, please don't. Oh my God! -Anna… -He is innocent. Anna! There are some hypocrites who look away when they see me in daylight and come knocking on my door at nights! Annan is not like you all. Be it dark or broad daylight, Annan has only one face! How many more houses do you have to go today? Around 15 houses. That's not enough. You should go to all the houses in this village. Wherever you go, tell them about what you saw and heard here today. I will say that! So everyone heard what happened, right? If I hear anyone speak any nonsense anywhere without knowing about this… you know Ammini well enough, right? I'll enter your house and beat you up! Podiyan, whatever said and done, what you did was really screwed up. No point in being angry now. We ended up giving him a chance to show off in front of everyone, for free. I heard that he beat everyone left, right and center! He'll trouble us until he dies. It's good that we thrashed him. Hey, look! It's me, guys! -Here comes the goon! -Put out that torch first! Where were you all this while? Wherever I go, people are lauding him. I am tired of hearing it. Hey! Did your aunt's son leave? Not aunt's. He is my uncle's son. Your uncle's dick! I heard that he even shit his pants sitting in Attingal. They are trained in Karate, dude. But what can they do when this guy beats without any discipline? Don't think any further. I suggest that we all should go and meet Ammini Annan. -Yes. -Should we go and fall at his feet? Well, if that's required. We started it, right? Get lost, scoundrels. I'm not ready to fall at his feet. I too have two hands and a conscience. I can't lose my honor. As if his honor has sky-rocketed now. These guys were traitors right from the beginning. And those guys made a blunder. I know what to do if there are no options left. Gopi and his boys are still here. Anna. Anna! Yes. Though I asked you to do it, I didn't expect you to do it so well! Once we accept a task, shouldn't we do it in the best way possible? But the task is still incomplete, right? It will be completed in due course. Hey! There's no light inside. He must have gone to bed. Remember what I told you? -I will go first. -Okay. I will call you if something happens. You should come then. You carry on. Though she's all happy and chatty with us, she is really anxious. If a woman is anxious, it is bad for the child as well. Is someone at the door? Wait here. Let me check. What do you want? I've come to see you. You saw me, right? Then leave! It is not like that. Are you here with some hideous plan, just like the other guy? You can beat me, kill me or do whatever you want, Anna. I cannot live miserably like this, Anna. Do you know how many days it has been since I slept peacefully? Can't you see him begging for it? Slap him and let him go, Anna. Please tell him, Chechi. Stop playing tricks and leave. Just one slap, Anna. I can go and sleep peacefully then. Please tell him, Chechi. Didn't I tell you? In broad daylight in front of an audience! Wow! There's plenty of light here, Anna. Just one slap, Anna. And if you want an audience… Hey Gopi, come here! Don't be scared. Annan won't hurt you. There are five guys. Come on. Who are they? My uncle's son from Attingal and his friends. They have come to meet you and apologize to you. There's no point if outsiders see it. It should be our people. Please settle this now, Anna. Chechi… What is his name? Gopi. Anna, we didn't know who you are. It was a mistake. Please forgive us. Leave now with Gopi and his friends. -And come tomorrow. -Okay. Alone! Okay, Anna. Shall I leave, Anna? Bye, Chechi. Come, let us go. I said it to his face, like a man. He understood. There was no need to hide like my friends. Yes, no need at all. Annan is a nice guy. This is how real men deal! Here's Mudippura Ammachi temple's sacrament for long life and prosperity! For you, Anna. Didn't you leave yesterday? I left, Anna. I woke up early in the morning. When you say something, we can't postpone it, right? What did I say? That we will discuss and settle everything in the morning. Right, Chechi? Ask Chechi, Anna. Get me a coffee. One for him too. Do you want it to be strong? A little. Here you go, Anna. -The sacrament. -Okay. This house and property must be around 50 cents, right Anna? Why? -Are you planning to buy it? -No, Anna. I was just asking. Drink it. Okay. I think I'm shivering due to the cold weather. Your star is "Avittam", right Anna? Luckily, we don't have mismatched stars. Your anger won't last long. My star is "Chothi". "Chothi" will ask for it and get it! What, Anna? -Shouldn't we strike off your name? -Yes, Anna. -We must. -Then come on. -Here you go. -Okay. Coming, Anna. He's just like a child, Chechi. He was easily pacified. Please pray for me, Chechi. Go on. Oh dear Goddess! I will ride it if your legs are aching, Anna. It's alright. I will do it. I realize now that I should have come and met you earlier itself. Is that Kunjukunju? Fight! Hey Peacock! Will the fight be over by the time we get there? -No. We will take the shortcut. -Turn it quickly. -Oh my dear peacock! -Turn it quickly. -Go that way. -Okay. -That way. Go fast. -We are going! Fight! Fight! Don't go. Come back. A fight is going to happen. Hey Peacock! Your sales will flourish today, right? Ambili, did you know? Ammini has caught Kunjukunju! He will be beaten black and blue today. Fracture, bone bend, sprain, dent. Bone pain, joint pain, muscle pain, nerve fatigue… not only these, but also for all ailments of the body, the perfect remedy, my Peacock Oil. Please come and buy it. Don't miss this chance to realize the merits of this amazing medicine. Those who want it can come. I will be in my vehicle. I will go and strike off my name, Anna. Move aside. I am going to strike off my name. -Maniya! -Yes, Anna. Bring that red paint and brush. Hey Kunjukunju, stop it! Move aside. Give it to me. I will do it. I'll strike off my name myself. Wasn't it me who struck off all these names? I will do this as well. Please tell him that I will strike it off, Anna! Let me strike off my name myself, Anna! Those were the guys who got their eardrum ruptured. This is a deal between real men. -We've discussed and settled everything. -When? Shall I go and do it, Anna? Move aside, you old hog! Why are you touching it? Oh dear Goddess! Let him strike it off, right Anna? Alright then, Anna. I will do it myself. As you wish, Anna. Is the fight over? No. They talked it out. -Talked it out? -Yes. -Who? Ammini Annan? -Yes. Ammini Annan. Oh no! Everybody move aside. He is a fast painter. He will do it quickly. These guys are so useless! Oh, there's plenty on my body! I could've reached here without the ladder? Here you go. I struck off only one "Kunju". The other "Kunju" is pending, right Anna? Yes. This is for striking it off without my permission. Didn't we talk it out at your house, Anna? It is not the people at home. -The villagers should see it, right? -Yes. -Is this enough? -Anna! Is this enough? I have toothache, Anna. -Is this enough? -Yes, that's enough! He will die if you beat him again. All of you say that it is enough! -Enough. -Enough, Ammini. -He will die if you beat him again. -Enough. He might die. Hey… strike off the other "Kunju" too. I will do that. Move aside. Strike it off! Respected villagers! Not just sprain, dent, fracture and pain. This Peacock Oil is also good for swelling, humming and numbness of the cheeks, caused when someone slaps you. Buy it now! Oh dear Goddess! Oh dear Goddess! It's just a small bump. It won't show. Just wear your sari over it. Everybody knows about it, right? In a way, since Ammini Annan saw us that night, no one will have two opinions about the child's father! You are as solid as a rock! But you have shaken a bit. I was not fortunate. When you got it, it turned out to be like this. Listen. If anything bothers your mind, it will affect the child. That's my worry. Now, even if he does not marry me, I will not allow anything bad to happen to the child inside me. Don't worry about that, Chechi. It is not like that. It won't be right if the alliance is broken. Moreover… all the blame will fall upon Annan. Those who carry him on their shoulders now, will look the other way. The wedding should not get canceled. What can we do about it? We must do something. Sari! Keep it. It will get the fragrance of Palm Flower if you keep it in your trunk. Sometimes Annan insists that I should have the fragrance of Palm Flower. If you wear it, Podiyan will also get addicted! Get lost, woman! -Hey! -Yes. Did you see him? I don't know where he is. Try to find him. What if he has a change of heart when he sees your bump? When we saw you leaving, we thought that you'd do something drastic. That was my plan. But it was Gopi who said that I have to see him in the future as well. I cannot go against Gopi's word, right? -Very good! -That's great. Hey! How was it? Have you ever had constipation? No. -Have you? -No. But it happened to me. After struggling for a couple days, you empty your bowels finally! It feels like heaven! That was the same feeling I had, after I was beaten by Ammini Annan. How many spectators were there? Maybe around 25. It was in the morning. Too early, right? It was really something when Pakki got it. There were a lot of people. In my case, it was just four guys. At any cost, we have to be at the forefront to organize Podiyan's wedding. Yes. So at any cost, we have to get him beaten up before the wedding. -What do you say? -Come on! I am ready. Come on! Got scared? Why have you come here? Thought I'd bring you something tasty. Who told you that I was here? I followed your scent. If you are so scared, why did you attack him? It's your dad who's scared! Really? Then come on and fight it out. Will you come for the wedding or not? You won't marry me if he hits you! And he won't let you marry me until he hits you! What should I do now? I will give birth even if you don't marry me. I will raise the child. You think Podiyan is a scoundrel who'd vanish after getting you pregnant? You don't have to do it alone. Why can't you show this boldness in front of him? It is not that I don't know to do it. I could have killed him that night if I wanted to. But I decided to spare him. But, what wrong have I done? What's his problem if I came to meet you? He was the one who started everything. And now all the villagers swear by him! One guy has sworn to beat up the other guy! And the other guy has sworn that he won't be beaten! And the girl is pregnant! Wonder how all this is going to end! My opinion is that Ammini Annan should loosen up this time. Let the wedding happen first. There is plenty of time left for beating and fighting! They are not allowing to write the shop's name… -Who is the caterer? -It is Ponthan Pillai and his team. Then it will be great! Then we can enjoy good Sambhar. No one makes Sambhar like Ponthan Pillai. -Ammini Annan isn't doing the right thing. -The Sambhar… But Ammini Pillai has to let the wedding happen, right? You think that because you sleep with guys who change their stands at will! Those who can't bear a slap, shouldn't get married! What's wrong in what Ammini Annan did? They tried messing with him when he was silent, right? Shameless guy! Doesn't Ammini want to beat him now? That is my doubt. Why? If he doesn't hit him, the wedding won't happen. The girl will stay there. That girl's belly is growing by the day. He should've thought of it, while doing it. -Listen. I have a doubt. -What? That girl had been loitering around Ammini's house. So, we can't blame him if he yearns for her. What's the guarantee that it is his child? What if Podiyan has that doubt too? Whatever you say, I am on Ammini Annan's side. What has to be settled with a fight, should be settled with a fight. Can it be settled by talking? Everyone saw Ammini Pillai's true nature. What are you saying? Ammini Annan is decent that way. Yeah, right! Such a decent fellow! Had it been for Ammini's old self, the wedding and fight would've been long over by now. What happened was a fight, right? She can't give birth. She is a barren woman. Won't Ammini have the desire to have a child? She can be whatever. If Ammini has such a desire, he knows how to make a child as well. Let her give birth. The father can be identified from the child's face. The wedding will be called off if Podiyan doesn't come. Then, that girl will have to shift to the neighboring house. What's the problem now? Did she say anything? Will this wedding happen? I am clueless. Who said that the wedding will not happen? -It will happen. -It must happen! If it doesn't happen, I won't be able to face anyone else. Hey! Where is Vasanthi? She is inside. What is it, Chechi? Do you know Lopez? Pani Pillai's son. I know him. What is it? I want to meet him and his friends. Why do you want to meet them? You will say it only if you know the reason? Come on! Come, dude! This place is full of itchy plants. Whose place is this? His uncle's ancestral house. Oh! Is this the place that was stuck in a case? What case! It will finally end up with Podiyannan itself. Careful. There's a rock over there. This way. Move. Come! Close the door. Hey! Who is it? Who is it, you fucker? Hey! Hey! Who is it? Open the door. Podiya, it's us! Just calm down! You rotten scoundrels! Are you betraying me, you pig? Open the door, rascal! Hey! Open it, you fuckers! Stop cursing us! This is for your wedding to happen. Are you going to make the wedding happen by locking me? Hey! Open the door! You better open the door. Or I'll tear your stomach open! Podiyanna, things are not like what you think. Ask him to come in person if he's man enough! Whatever it is for! Even if it is to kill or be killed, I am ready! Don't panic. Someone is coming in person. Yes. I have come alone. Don't be scared. Nothing matters to me. Not your friends or villagers, your fights or your egos. What matters to me is her life… and the child inside her. The wedding should happen tomorrow at the announced time itself! Annan won't be able to catch you. That's my promise. How can I be sure of that? As soon as the wedding is over, take her with you, and go live somewhere else. It will be really hectic tomorrow. Take this with you. What are you going to do? Tell me, Chechi. The wedding must happen tomorrow. That's all! You leave now. You won't tell me, right? Try to hit the bed early. You have to wake up early in the morning tomorrow. This has your fragrance now, Chechi. I am asking you one last time. There's no change in your decision, right? I have 20 stitches on my body because of him! And on top of that, that bastardy game he played after that. Why do you look like you are unwell? It's nothing. You carry on. Don't stress yourself out. He will come. The wedding will happen… after he gets slapped by me. Who is it? Open the door! Who is it? Open it, I say! Open it! Is it you, Podiyan? Her wedding must happen. I am left with no other option, Anna. Open it, you bloody wretch! Open it! You! Open it! Open it, I say! I knew that you will help me. I just came to make sure. But there's a lot of time left for the auspicious hour. I got restless thinking whether you will change your mind. You! So, I'm putting another lock on it. What are you doing? Step aside. -Step aside! -Forgive me, Chechi. I am left with no other option. If you have any shame, you won't go and marry her. Open the door! -Good-for-nothing! -Anna! Open it! -Open it if you are man enough! -Anna! Anna! Hey! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Don't touch me, you bloody wretch! Leave me! Anna! I am going to get married without getting slapped by you. Thought I should inform you. You were at the forefront for everything, right? Even if it's at the last minute, you must come, Anna! I'll leave a chair vacant at the front. Shall I leave, Anna? -You! -Hey, don't get up! Lie down. Lie down. Lie down, I say! I came to invite Annan for the wedding. You should also come, Chechi. PODIYAN PILLAI WEDS VASANTHI Prabha, I need to take a picture along with Usha. Walk fast. Pour the water. Give it to him. Where's the garland? Come inside. Come inside. Shall we open the shop without striking his name off? Shut up! Podiyan is so lucky! Play the music! Even if you slap him or get slapped, it should happen in front of all these people! No one should say that the father of my child is a coward, later on. Get up! This is my Annan's hand as well. It just has a couple of bangles on it. EMS… AKG… Long live Sundarayya! Ammini… Sit! Go on! A FEW DAYS LATER Everything calmed down at Anchuthengu. It's true that one should only mess with their equals. We were all just silly kids for Annan. And like Dad said, even though he hit us, he really did care for us. And we were really lucky that he did… PODIYAN
