The many thousands of batteries For the tears of our mothers For our homeland... Fire! Fire! Comrade Lieutenant, Regimental Commander. Battery, still! Comrade Colonel, enemy tanks held back. 18 burned, others turned back. Our losses: one gun, 5 killed, 8 wounded. So... Hail, comrades! - Hail! Well fought! - Long live the Soviet Union! At ease. - At ease! Well done, lads. Well fought in true Suvorov style. This success should be noted. Oh, and the Muscovites have sent us some parcels. So I've brought you some for the entire battery. One very amusing one, specially selected for you. A funny design and quite suitable inscription: "The gunners' hero." You guessed it! Well, Lieutenant, give him the package. Here it is. Judging by the sound there's some fine juice here too? No objection? - Thank you, Comrade Colonel. Well, then take it. Now get some rest. Kill all the Nazis Moscow What juice could there be here when it was sent by children? Well, they sent it to adults. Open up! Right away. Oh! Four boxes of cigarettes. Two each. - Right! Six chocolate bars. Three per brother. - Good! Half a dozen handkerchiefs. Divided into two. Towel... One! Can't be divided, well then? - Cut in half. Good idea. Socks! - How many? One pair. - Never mind. You take them. Why? That's unfair. - Well, you're the commander. Those socks wouldn't fit me anyway. Cognac. Pasha! Cognac! - Well... Three stars. - That's great! Well done, kids. See that? Smart thinking. A letter. Dear hero, our aunt Varya often tells us about the war, about artillery. And when we grow up we will also shoot artillery at the fascists. We send you our card, we wrote it with aunt Varya. When you're in Moscow come and visit. We live in Zamostvorechye in Kudashevskiy Lane, no. 5, kindergarten. Ask for our aunt Varya. Kill all the fascists soon! Hugs from all at the kindergarten. Wonderful kids, huh? - Yes, but the aunt's even better. Come on, show me. Not much. Will we divide the card? - For sure. But how? - We cut it. You the children, me the aunt. Oh, you sly one! No, I don't agree. You know what, let's consider it a common card? What do you mean "common"? - Well, ours, yours and mine. No, that's complicated... Although, I agree. Give it to me here. Where? I'll hide it in my wallet, or we'll lose it. Yours, and why not my wallet? You see? I said it was complicated. Take it. When you're in Moscow, come and visit. Oh, baby, baby... When will that be? Moscow, you know, My native town, I know her like the back of my hand I come from Ordynka, Native Muscovite In Moscow, comrade, I'm home While I was born by the Volga waters Us soldiers in the far Urals As if about a mother's dear heart We reminisced about Moscow Such tales we've told about her About her rustling leaves And we've loved ever since childhood This Russian word... Moscow And we've loved ever since childhood This Russian word... Moscow I know in Moscow all byways and paths I know each square I can pass through Moscow in the dark From Polyanka to Taganka by touch Whilst here I get lost, in Moscow it's true, In two days I'm acquainted with her But no less than you I'm proud to claim Of calling Moscow my own Such tales we've told about her About her rustling leaves And we've loved ever since childhood This Russian word... Moscow And we've loved ever since childhood This Russian word... Moscow. And we've loved ever since childhood This Russian word... Moscow. And we've loved ever since childhood This Russian word... Moscow. 6:00 pm. Zamoskvoreche, Moscow, Kremlin! Really hard to believe. And we still have the whole evening. - Yes. Vasya, Shall we go to the circus? - Yes, the circus? Moscow is full of soul! - So why not crack open a bottle of wine? No thanks. If we hang around we've only ourselves to blame. Friend Pasha, I want something, but what it is, I just don't know. Somewhere draws me... I want to sit at a peaceful table, with quiet conversation. So, let's go to the circus with its polar bears. You're a polar bear yourself. - Well, tumble into bed. This evening? Well, make up your mind, let's go or not? Or maybe we'll go to Zamoskvorechye? It's not unknown to us, the kindergarten, eh? Why go there? No thanks. I'm too big for kindergarten. Kids are not really my thing. Or maybe look for signs of Aunt Varya. The kids are put to bed early, we sit, have a chat, because we're messengers from the front, eh? No, personally I'm going to the circus. And you? Me, I'll look at Moscow. Think, dream, wander. Well, wander. Lieutenant Kudryashov! Lieutenant Kudryashov. How did you come to be here? After all, you're strolling around Moscow, eh? You know, I strolled and strolled... Well, and wandered. At random. - At random? And you? - What about me? You went to the circus to the polar bears. Ah... Well, you know, too, somehow... I strolled and strolled and wandered. - At random? You know, Vasya, it's no good. What? - Well, they invited us both and you... No squabbling! Let's both go. Let's go. Although no point, I knocked, there was no answer. Better go look in the window. Who are you looking for? Who do you want here? We want... - Aunt Varya. - Yes. Name? Don't know. - Which apartment? - Apartment? No idea. Duty comrade, I've detained two suspicious characters. Walking around the yard, looking in the window. They can't explain their behaviour. Yes, yes, yes. - What is it, comrades? Tell me. Her! - Exactly! Who do you want? You! - What? Me? We need our aunt Varya. What's this to do with me? What? You're our aunt. - From the kindergarten? Let me see, who do you need? Me, an aunt or kindergarten? You and kindergarten. The kindergarten's evacuated. - Fine! But you stayed. And you... What do you need in our backyard? You invited us to visit. Me? - Yes, you! I didn't invite anyone, there are no visitors now. No, that is, not you, your kids. Kids! What kids? You're talking through your hat. After all, she's not yet married. - Perfect! We're quite satisfied. Stop joking, produce your documents. Produce them! - But we're guests! - With the artillery! Present your documents or I'll call the commandant. - Present? - Present. Here's our document. Oh, my! My hero gunners! Well, heroes I don't know... - But gunners, that's for sure! Why didn't you tell me that before? We've only just told you! Please, sit down. - We can stand. That's so uncomfortable. Sit down. - Thanks. Aunt Katya, what have you done? Lord! What have you done? Varya, Varya, didn't you know, if they were invited or not? I sent them gifts, Sent them greetings. I forgot all about it, Very embarrassing for me now, I invited them to visit, They almost kicked the door in. You invited us to visit, We almost kicked the door in. On behalf of our home, with 140 apartments. One hundred and forty? With 530 rooms... And living here 2000 souls Two thousand souls We really are truly sorry And hope that you can forgive In our house you truly are welcome So make yourself home as our guests In our house you truly are welcome So make yourself home as our guests Are you planning to stay here long? - Tomorrow we're home to our battery. Tell me, what's your friend's name? - Pavel Demidov. Pasha? - Yes. Everything here is gaiety, full of children, but there aren't any. And my heart afire. - They were evacuated long ago. And you? - I stayed. - Don't the shots deafen you? - Not at all. Have you got a medal? Yes. - What for? For firing the guns and sometimes hitting the target. Well, what can I tell you? - What? What? Tell us what medals you received? - Right! What battles did you take part in? - Right! Tell us! OK, OK. After the peaceful, long, sultry nights I could tell you my friends, How a bullet whistles And how a bomb rumbles, But that's not important, my friends! What matters, midst booming and blazing of battle What always live in our hearts Are relatives, friends All that we hold dear What people call the Motherland. Relatives, friends And all that we hold dear, Are what people call the Motherland Perhaps I could add, girls, to such a story, Could add a particular fact, What happens out there is sometimes quite dreadful, But that's not important, my friends! What matters, at front line With enemies fighting, Our cherished songs are still sung, Your letters are read, And laughter is heard With death just ten minutes away Our letters are read, And laughter is heard With death just ten minutes away It sometimes happens, girls, That we will feel sadness, Pining for our native lands The song's interrupted, One's heart is quite pounding, But that's not important, my friends! What matters is under the roof of your homestead It's pleasant and joyful to us, As guests it seemed, We came here to strangers, But actually became your friends. As guests it seemed You came here as strangers, But actually became our friends. And we girls dream in the evening A distant road calls us too To be a fighter, Reconnaissance scout Above the coast at this disturbing hour. Courage and strength Believe me, that's enough! And we will not falter, Engaging in battle. And our superintendent, is Aunt Katya, Sends us of to work! And our superintendent, Aunt Katya, Sends us off to work! Attention! - Green! Places! Check hoses, sand, shovels! Quickly! And you, comrade commanders, will have to be bored in the shelter. Come, I'll take you. With you, Ekaterina Mikhailovna, it's a pleasure. What are your girls like? Organized! Where are you going? - Where? To the roof. Aren't you afraid? - Sure. Still going? - Why not? I'm on duty, I must go. Can I go with you? - Why? It's awful there. - So, it's awful... No worse than at the front. - In my opinion, worse. Well, let's compare. Shall we? - Let's go. Well, look. Compare... Yes, worrying. Still, it's not what we put up with. Really! Damn it! What's wrong with you? What's wrong? Are you afraid? Terribly! What a monstrous storm. It bursts like an iron wind. Awful! But we, Varya, we can't be afraid. - How much sorrow is in the world now. My heart bursts in my chest. Just thinking of those killed, burned... Awful! - And how much still ahead of us... Such nights here... tense, sleepless. How many tanks in our way? And they all seek to crush us. And still so many battles yet to be fought? So, it's better not to be afraid. Oh, look, a glow! Is it Fili. - No! It's Kuncevo. - Probably. For the threatening battle arise! Defenders of the Russian land! Arise, arise, show no mercy On your harsh way Arise, arise, show no mercy On your harsh way Anxiety envelops now Our beloved Moscow In step with the unit, now leaving the soldiers It's time for us to part Farewell, farewell We'll return with a victory. Moscow, dear, farewell! Do not quite forget us! Your maidenly memory is weak Farewell! - Farewell! Write to us often However we can't tell you where Farewell and know That the memory of you Will live long deep in my heart In the pack of fortune telling cards The King of diamonds, that's me! Goodbye, I must run now. The troops are all marching. Goodbye, see you my friends! Goodbye, heroes! Boldly arise, We'll come to help you, my friends. Marching units, The girls went into battle, And we, friend, we must be with you! Farewell, farewell We'll return with a victory. Moscow, dear, goodbye! Pashka, do you know what's happened to me? Judging by your appearance, a bit too much. You oddball, Pashka! I've just met Varya. Who? - Yes, Varya! Aunt Varya remember? Really! Where, where is she? - She's here! Three kilometres away. - Yes? On a farm with a team of girls working on the fortifications. That's great! Perfect! Let's meet up, let's go! That's great! Aunt Varya here! This is great! What's that? - What's what? Where are you going? - What do you mean? To visit Varya. She invited me, what's it to do with you? To do with me? Didn't we get the parcel together? - Well? Share everything in half? - Half. - Card was for both? - Both. So why can't I visit her? Ah... Because you're selfish! Nice! So you'll go visit Varya and me? She only invited me. What? And don't you think, Lieutenant, that she invited you, in the hope that I'd come with you, huh? Come on, Pasha, Varya and I need a serious talk. And you want to arrange an excursion. Maybe invite the entire battery? - What? What an idea! This idea, Vasya! Let's invite the guys and all go together, in order of rank, eh? Yeah, well, I'm not joking. I'm telling you, Varya, I seriously need to talk to Varya, OK? Oh, seriously... Well, all right. Vasya! Come on, let's go together, and greet Varya simultaneously and to whom she first gives her hand will talk to her seriously, and the other disappears forever. Agree? - You know... it's... It's outrageous! Afraid, Lieutenant, a coward? - Who, me? You, a handsome man, you! - Lieutenant Demidov! Well, to hell with you, I agree. - Here, friend! Here, friend! Vaska! - Pasha! Damn! And so! Let's visit? - Let's go! It's altogether more pleasant, brothers Here, in the artillery! All fine, brave fellows How can one choose? Who has a short conversation with the enemy? In artillery they are daredevils In the artillery they are brave soldiers Suvorov himself praised our courage, Kutuzov led the battle for the Fatherland We smashed the enemy more than once... Girls, it's Kudryashov with the gunners visiting us. It's him! I'd recognise him from a hundred miles! Company, the gunners... Just look at yourself, shame! We're dirty, we haven't washed... Come on, girls! It's good to serve in the infantry, How good! Better in the cavalry And all the more pleasant, brothers in the artillery! Dismount! May I invite you. - With pleasure. Yes, but which of you two? - That's your choice. Goodness, I don't know where to look. Each one is better than the other. Well, choose me. - Choose me! Excuse me, but why not me? I danced with you in Moscow. - Yes. Well, now it's... Wow, what about you! Excuse me, what's your name? - Fenya. What? - Fenya! Short for what, Thekla? - Yes. Such a lovely name! Allow me? - With pleasure! Over the free, the blue, the Quiet Don The marching song sounded The Cossack departed, leaving for war His bride waved him goodbye His bride waved him goodbye I wish you happiness, my dear, on the way Whether I return to the Don is unknown The Cossack told her: "Farewell!" "Farewell!" answered the bride. "Farewell!" answered the bride. A sad dawn lit up the steppe The waves sparkled bright on the Don This tobacco pouch I give you as a parting gift Embroidered by my own fingers Embroidered by my own fingers Be brave and courageous midst the horrors of war For the Russian land your are fighting Remember the Don and your waiting bride And to them hurry back soon Here we are, I've brought you out a long way. It's getting dark... Time to go back. If you only knew how hard it is, to have just met, and now to say goodbye. Yes, we know each other so little. And yet my heart is full of sorrow and pain. Today we're marching off at exactly 21:00. And I might not see you, not meet you, hear you sing the way you do. Might only have this last precious evening to tell you that I love you? There's no need to rush into this word. Goodbye. - Wait! There's a storm brewing. Now, when there are so many partings in the world, it's not the time to joke about love. How is it possible, at first sight? - And maybe, it's not a problem. Because I need nothing from you and we may never see each other again. All this is strange to your ears, perhaps. My speech is unclear and confused, coarsened in the searing flames. I've bathed in the blood of battles. How many dead I've seen... a thousand. And tonight I return to battle once more. But the more intense the war, the purer, more intense my love. Look, what a cloud! A storm! It's over the forest! The cloud's over the meadow! The copse! The fields! I want to cry out! That I love you in spite of any separation. I wish to meet with you in victory, to see the sea, ships, cities. That I love you for life! And I leave in 10 minutes, perhaps forever. War! Yes. War... Give me something for the road. What then? Perhaps a pink handkerchief, from my pocket. Or this here birch leaf, turning yellow with autumn fire? Or maybe words such as these... I will remember you 'til my dying day. Varya! You... You've said such words to me! Have made me such a gift! As if the wound's been bandaged by gentle, affectionate hand. Maybe here is not the place for a vow and now we are parting again, but I beg you to be my bride. May I call you that? A bride... Truly, a wonderful word, but it's not such an easy word to say. After all we're not parting in a fairy tale, nor in a song, I'm not a Cossack, and you're not a Cossack. But it's no cause for alarm. Well, perhaps reading your letter in the mist of a march, a short answer will be sent. You are funny. - Maybe my words are ridiculous. But I'll think of you as my bride. Well then... together let's struggle through the flames of war. Varya, do you agree? - I don't know. Maybe it's in vain and even somehow inappropriate. But I'm... I'm... - Varya, you... I am your fiancée. Say bride and the heart will pound! We won't have a care! I am your bride, and as the song says. I now have only one thing left to say to the groom on the road: "Farewell!" Farewell! I knew it. The rain held off. Varya, my dear bride-to-be. It's good that we met. - It's good. When shall we meet again? - I don't know. Well, somehow we should meet again? At 6:00 pm after the war. Exactly, one minute left. Exactly, darling, don't say anything. War! War... War! Well, when? Where? Let's meet in Moscow. The Kremlin. On the bridge over the river? - At 6:00 pm. After the war? - Don't be late, my dear. Farewell! Farewell! Farewell! Be brave and courageous midst the horrors of war For the Russian land you are fighting Remember Moscow, and your bride And return to them with your victory! And return to them with your victory! I send you greetings, my dear. My words fly to you, full of friendship. From the great front from the front line, from the sad and terrible fields of war. Where are you now, my dear? Will my voice fail on this long road? Will it find the road to your land? Will the wind blow it to your windows? What can I tell you about myself? We've moved through the fields, forests, steppes. In a blood soaked, difficult and lengthy struggle, scrambling over the earth, we fell back. Many the roads I had to take, much grief I had to swallow, I lost companions along the way, beat the fascists whilst there was strength enough. And falling to the floor in a gloomy dugout, in the frightful and anxious midnight hour, half asleep, in the twilight I thought, about everything, but especially about you. The bit you wrote, a couple of lines, about our first meeting, about the quiet river and for some reason about the yellow leaf, that you held in your hand. Now it is winter, snow blocks the roads, you get up before dawn. How hard it must be for you, the harsh work in the biting wind. If I could, my dear, I would rush to you through the darkness of the night, I would warm your hands with my breath, might sing a funny song. Forgive me for writing to you so often, but because I know you, my friend, I ask you, to wish me happiness. Dawn is not far off and at dawn, battle. Dawn is not far off and at dawn, battle. At dawn, battle. My faithful companion, my dear friend, Your words have brought me much joy. I have read your letter eight times. Don't worry about me, I am healthy and active. It is warm and I am not tired. I'm used to hard work. Do not worry, I live well. Here we are only worried, you must understand, for you, for your friends and for our Moscow. The ominous song of the guns gets ever louder, closer and closer they are to Moscow. For days we've built fortifications, setting dragon's teeth, digging ditches. We heat the frozen ground with fires, and with our hearts are carried off into the dark night, to your divisions, regiments, batteries and to yours, especially dear to me. Comrade Commander, Lieutenant Demidov in position. Demidov! Well done! Excellent! Pasha! Get ready! Let the show begin! Elevation 43, 80! Aim 5.2! Battery fire! Demidov! Pasha! 0.2 right! Aim 5.6! - Aim 5.6! Battery! Two shells! Fire! Well, Pasha! Elevation less than 0.01! Elevation less than 0.01! - Less than 0.01! Five shells! In a salvo! Fire! Stop! Well done, Pasha! Well done! Right on target! Damn! Found me, the bastards! To the right 0.45! - Right 0.45! 6.5 Aim! Fire! Well done, Pasha! Well, let's try once more! - Enjoy yourselves, lads! Crush the bastards! Fire! Gun! Gun! Gun! Fire! Gun! Gun! NP! NP! NP! Kudryashov! Vasya! Kudryashov! Vasya! Check the connection, guys! Get the commander on the radio, Hurry! - Very good! What's this? Comrade Lieutenant, Commander at observation post. Vasya! Vasya! Kudryashov! Why are you silent? - Why have you ceased fire? Continue! - Continue the fire! The guns! 5.8 aim! Three shells The foreigners... are on the run! Fire! That's it. Pasha! Demidov! I'm surrounded, I'll engage combat! - Retreat, Vaska! Retreat, damn it! - Too late, Pasha! The lads have been killed and I'm wounded. Goodbye, friend! Goodbye! Retreat! Damn it! Stay here. Continue to fire! Three with me on skis! Quickly! Restore communication. Keep on firing! Vasya! How are you? Vasya! Are you alright, Vasya? Vasya! Don't you know me, friend? Pashka! - Vasya! Why are you here? Where's the battery? Why stop the fire? Fire! Fire! Easy, Vasya. - Fire! Fire! It seems my friend wasn't able to come. But don't see me off, Avdotia Ivanovna. It's not far to the station, I'll make it. Well, goodbye. - Goodbye, son. Thank you for your kindness, for your attention. For everything. All the best to you, Vassily Ivanovich. Thank you, Grandma. All the best. - Thank you. Sorry, friend, I was delayed. Pashka! - Vasya! Pashka! Vasya! Well... Get in, Vasya, let's go. You see, Pasha, I don't have to dance any more. Yes, you always were a poor dancer, Vasya. So, to our meeting, to the military road to the wind flying from the southern steppes. To Varya... - Hold on a bit. Don't drink! Tell me, are you my friend? Well! It's against the rules. What do you mean? I don't drink without friends. Listen! Now you swear to me, Pavel, that you'll comply with one request of mine. I beg you dearly, This will surprise you, my request. And you must swear. - I'm already worried. Frankly, I'm puzzled. But I will bow to your request. On what will I swear... Oh, vodka! I swear! - Pavel, don't laugh! There'll be no meeting! No meeting! A heart... yearning aches... Tomorrow you will leave for Zamoskvorechye and tell Varya that I've... been killed. I don't understand... Well, come up with any explanation yourself. Say that Lieutenant Kudryashov died a heroic death on the battlefield. Wait, wait. Let me touch your forehead. Maybe you're sick. - Why? Why tell her this? A legless disabled person on crutches... Why should I spoil her life? Why give her such a burden? She's a... fine hearted person. I know... she wouldn't say anything. It would be my lifelong regret. She wouldn't desert me, she wouldn't forget... But it makes it more painful for me. Maybe after four, or six months it would be! If she was my wife, I would go back to share her sorrow. But she's only just known me, our love is only at its beginning. It is fanned by the smoke of war, it blows like a spring breeze. So... let it pass... pass on by. Let our meeting never have taken place. Of course, Vaska, you and I are friends, but now you are in a different position! You see, Pasha, you can't lay a hand on me! I don't want... I don't want your condescension! Well! Speak up, Varya? - No! I won't speak! I don't have enough strength for this. I Kudryashov, am trembling with rage. Yes, because it's you she loves, Vasily! How can I tell her this? Let such a lie come from my lips? But she will know everything. And to know this, Pasha... is a serious business! You're afraid of me now, Kudryashov. You don't have to face such weariness! You can grind them into dust. You're healthy! You've still your strength. - Yes, I'm healthy. You've got a point. Strength is coursing through my veins, brother. But yesterday I fell face down into a flower bed. I went... and forgot that my leg was missing. You're right, I'm not any weaker at all, so I'll strike a blow against any enemy. Paschka, I still want to fight, want to go back to the battery! I can't at such a hour sit by the stove, reading my future. I can't live without my bunk, without you! Without friends, without you, you scoundrel! You saw me in the war, Pasha. You know, I got used to the roar of battle. I didn't hide, I didn't stand aside. I calmly walked into the fires of hell. I hate those damned Nazis. My whole soul is out there, in the war! Yesterday... the recruiting office... sent me a pension book. So, it's over! Period! Finished! Pour some more vodka, Demidov. I drink... to pensioner Vasily Kudryashov. And for you to fulfil his vow. To Varya... who thinking me dead... does not occasionally wait up in the evenings. Or maybe she has read in the papers that you got a second class order? Say it was awarded posthumously. Hope will never leave her. With what weight, with what incalculable burden, have you laden my heart, Vaska! My conscience won't allow me to say it! I feel so offended! A disabled person appeals to you, You must help this disabled invalid. The tanks move, the artillery fire! Song of war! Woodland thicket! Pashka! - You better not touch me! Pashka! Will you fulfil the vow? I don't know! - Hey, you! A fine friend! Over the free, the blue, the Quiet Don The marching song sounded The Cossack departed, leaving for war His bride waved him goodbye His bride waved him goodbye I wish you happiness, my dear, on the way Whether I return home is unknown The Cossack told her: "Farewell!" "Farewell!" answered the bride. Well, tell me. Where is Vasya? How is he? Well, out with it. It was winter... Vasily was with the infantry, directing fire. The Germans attacked his observation post and surrounded it. Vasya was badly wounded. But he fought back. We arrived, drove the Germans back, but... it was too late... I rushed up to him... picked him up... and he whispered: "Tell Varya that the meeting..." He so loved you, Varya! So much! That's it. It's not true. That's not all. Why are you deceiving me? Why aren't you telling the truth? I know everything. - What do you know? That you saved him, then you were wounded again. Both of you were sent to hospital. Why are you deceiving me? I know everything. You don't know anything! - I know! I searched, I managed, I wrote to his unit! And I was told that he was wounded. Where is Vasily, tell me, Pavel! Just tell the truth! The truth! Where is he? What's happened to him? He's alive, right? He's alive? Don't lie to me, tell me, Pavel! Come on, say it! - He's alive! Damn him, he's alive! - Alive! I cannot lie, I cannot lie. Where is he? Where? I want to see him today, right now! Get dressed! I'll take you to him now and you can sort it out between you. Vasya! Where is Kudryashov? I'm telling you, he's gone. - Where is he? He's gone. Gone? - He asked me to give you this letter. What nonsense is this? Farewell, friend! I'm going away forever. What... See how badly it all turned out? Thanks for your friendship, I'll never forget you, look after Varya. I love her so..." A year passed. And then another... Varya, I've received another letter from Demidov, it's the seventh. 10 pages! - Where does he get so much paper from? And what does he write about? - The same, about love. Love... You know, Varya, when we parted, we decided just like you. Just like us? - To meet on the bridge. At 6:00 pm after the war. Wonderful! Silly you! None of these promises come true. It means only sorrow. - It'll work out, Varya, it will! Maybe it will turn out right for you, but I will never see Kudryashov... You will see him! We'll all meet up together! I can see it all so clearly! It takes one's breath away! Look, what is it? An armoured train! Girls! The armoured train! What! - Wonderful! Love burns in our hearts for our dear country, A mortal fight ahead For the honour of our land. Cities aflame, dark mass of smoke engulfing, Thunders in grey forests the stern god of war. Gunners The exact order has been given, Gunners, The Motherland calls us! Of the many thousands of batteries For the tears of our mothers, For our homeland Fire! Fire! Know, dear mother, Read, wife, girlfriend, Read, whole family And my distant home, What beats and burns the enemy Is our steel blizzard, That we will carry to our native land. Gunners The exact order has been given, Gunners The Motherland calls us! Of the many thousands of batteries Look! For our homeland... Fire! Armoured train! Halt! Left turn! Fall out!! Vasya... Vasya! Vasya! Kudryashov! Vasya! Varya! Varya! I thought, I'd never see you again. - And I thought so too. How could you walk away, run away, hide? How could you not believe in my love? - I myself for a while didn't believe in it. I was tormented by suffering, only later I realized that if in a person there is hatred and love, that such a person could never be helpless or useless! Forgive me, my dear. - You're good, so good! And I love you so much! - Varya! Comrades! My friends! It's Varya, my bride! I'm so happy! I'm so very happy, comrades! Hooray! Goodbye, girls. Goodbye, guys. Good luck in battle. There's so much to say to each other The time here together so short Get going, get going, Now hurry, get going The locomotive whistle it sounds We wanted to say So much, so much, The time here together so short So you don't forget now, my darling Where you agreed we should meet The long separation How short is the meeting And both of us now off to war We must be leaving the engine has started Goodbye, see you in Moscow I'm off to the front with my comrades I don't know if I'll see you again - Til we meet! - Til we meet! Until our victory and that evening after the war Til we meet, til we meet, Until our victory And that evening after the war Til we meet! Til we meet! Until our victory And that evening after the war And the song was silent The train in the distance And only the birches to see Hanya! Hold on, Hanya! Faster! - Look out! Hurry, girls! Katya, take the second! Katya, the second! Airplane! Airplane! On the enemies tracks swept the snow On went the divisions, forgetting all fatigue! In a fierce battle they crushed the enemy! And in the sky another day caught fire! The ominous shadow of war departed! The country flexed it mighty shoulders! Ever closer, ever closer, it, the joyous day! Day of our victory! Happy day! Day of reunion! Vasya! Kudryashov! Pasha! Friend! Well, show yourself! Handsome, healthy, chest covered with medals! The rank of Major! Congratulations! Congratulations! And you're just the same! Always kidding. The war did you no harm. Such a character, Vasya! - Right, Pasha, and stay that way. A happy life. - Wait, I'm angry at you. I even wanted to beat you. - For what? Why did you run away? Varya and I were looking for you, how we searched! I couldn't bear it. Then, I knew that you had deceived me. Ah, you knew? Sly dog, you sly dog! Yes, Pasha. - Yes. What about Varya? Where is she? - She's an anti-aircraft gunner, Sergeant. She was at the front. - Yes, I know. We met by chance at the junction. Somewhere near Vyazma. And this past year, I've lost sight of her again. Yes... And I've received 12 letters from Thecla, one a week. and suddenly, one day, everything went quiet. Where is she now, my Feklusha? What has happened to her? I don't know... And I don't know either. 6:00 pm. Y-yes! Well, I must go. I must dash. - Wait! Where are you going? Yes, you know, Vasya,..
