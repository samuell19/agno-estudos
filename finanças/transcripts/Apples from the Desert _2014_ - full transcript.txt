Competition among Japanese children starts at a very young age, in kindergarten. The kids study very hard for the entry exams. Good for them. But often their accomplishments are accompanied by depression... Really? Is he back? - He'll be back any minute. Here, this is for you. It's best you eat in the privacy of your own home. Did you ask him about Saturday night? Not yet. I will today. Thank you, I love you. "National Service" Scientists once believed that the mantle would restore itself in a few years. Hello there. - Good evening. Are you alright? - Yes. Rivka? Yes, I'm fine. A treaty between the USA and the European Community commits to gradually reduce the use ofpreons. That ends ourprogram on ozone depletion. Goodbye to all our listeners. I turned it off as soon as the music came on. Good. Where's Rivka? In her room. Is your sister coming? No. Even better. He's been like this since Shabbat. Since Shabbat? He's been like this his entire life. Hey. It's not ready yet. What do you want? He wanted many kids. What can you do, it's God's will. Blessed are You, God, King of the universe... Amen. How about wearing dresses with buttons in the front? I hate buttons in the front. If you were married, your husband could do up your buttons. I won't get married so someone can do up my buttons. I like things just the way they are. If I want to, I'll meow like a cat from my window, I'll go to Venice to see how people live on water. It's these clothes. But we can't go naked, can we? I give myself a break under my clothes. What do you mean? When I'm hot I go without socks, without a bra, without panties. Sarah, I swear, you're one of a kind. What does God care about my panties? No wonder you never got married. I never wanted to, don't change my story. Lucky you never got married, he'd divorce you right away. I'd divorce him first. God help me, what a mouth. But your mouth is all you have. You have parts that you've never used at all. And even the ones I use are in bad shape. Here, help me with this. - Okay. You know what I'm afraid of, Sarah? - What? That one day Abarbanel will say, tell your sister never to set foot in my house. I'll set foot wherever I'm welcome. I don't want you to fight because of me. Hello. Hello. How much is this? 30. That's too expensive. I can pay 20. Fine, 25. Thank you. - Take care. Hello, Mr. Shaltiel. - How are you? People want to buy but they don't have any money. How's your daughter? She finally completed the seminary. She started working. - Praise God. I don't see her at synagogue anymore. - She's working hard. Does she still have all those weird notions? God forbid. What about getting married? Soon, God willing. I was thinking of my brother. Yaakov the widower? He's a good man and he makes a good living. Shaltiel, she's too young. Just think about it, Abarbanel. Before it's too late. God keep you, good tidings. Hi. Hi. - You come here a lot. How do you know? I work here, I've seen you a few times. Do you dance? No, I mostly stand. You wanna come in? Can I? - Sure. Really? - Yeah. Your daughter's gone. I know. Do you know where she is? Why, what happened? - Nothing yet. She's at work. I thought she's finished for the day. No, she has the evening shift. Who said she could work so late? She has a lot of work, what's with you? I put one in already, that's enough. Blessed are You, God, King of the universe... Wow. You dance really nice. Come to class on Thursday. I won't tell anyone. Goodbye. Hello. Where have you been, Rivka? I was out with my friends, I didn't notice the time, so if my parents ask, I was at your place, okay? Alright. Look at him, how cute, he loves apples, look. Look, look. This is no cat, he's got the soul of a human being. Mom said you got rid of him. No way, I wouldn't do that. Abraham drove out Hagar, look at the trouble we have now. God forgive me. I was calling you all day, you didn't answer your phone. My battery died. Where have you been so late at night? I was taking inventory at work. - Until now? Then I went to Aunt Sarah. What for? Just a visit. Did Rivka visit you? When? No more night shifts for you. And if you want to visit people, you'll get my permission first! She's my aunt. - So what? She's people too, isn't she? I haven't seen her so happy in a long time. We have to keep an eye on her. Remember how she drank bleach? What are you talking about? Just forget about it! She said no more than 50 words for a whole year. Maybe she's in love? In love? Why not? Just like you at her age. Me? Yes, you, with Abarbanel. Peeking at him from the women's section, turning red like a tomato. 1, 2, 3, twirl. One more... - Stop it. -Stretch the arm. Stop. - Close. Yisaschar was asking about you. I said you have allergies. I can't do all the work and lie for you too. How about coming with me? - No way. What would I do there? Lots of things. There's exhibitions, dancing. Girls and boys together? Yes, but... Oh, look who we have here! How's the allergy? Better. Thank God. We'll end up in hell with all these lies. I hear that Rivka has allergies. What allergies? She says she has allergies and leaves work. Where is she now? Victoria's wayward daughter. Did you know she skips work? No. I didn't know. Shaltiel came to see me a few days ago. He was very gentle. His widowed brother is looking for a wife. He makes a good living, he has a big house with lots of rooms. He has children too, what kind of fool would want that? Not my intelligent sister Sarah, that's for sure. I wasn't talking about her. You think Shaltiel would want your sister Sarah? Then who are you talking about? Our Rivka? Our little girl? That girl has a bad temper and she's always arguing. She's a sweet child, a flower. She deserves better than Shaltiel. If she doesn't act quickly, someone else will marry him. Did you promise Rivka to him? I said I'd think about it. You're wasting your time, she won't want him. That's why she has parents who know what's best for her. Her mother doesn't think this is best for her. 19 is too young for a widower with three kids. He'll love her, take care of her, she'll be happy with him. She has another 10 years before she has to worry about someone like that. Then you find her a match, and do it quick. She already met a few men and all she did was humiliate us. People are talking, Victoria. In the end she'll never marry. You're selling our daughter cheap. How much is she worth? People still laugh that she likes to drink bleach. She'll end up like her aunt, God forbid. Cheers. Blessed are You, God, King of the universe... Amen. Were you born in Jerusalem? I've only been here for 3 years, I work and go to school. What are you studying? - Plant biology. I have two more exams and then I go back to the kibbutz. I'll show you, we grow organic apples unlike any other, they're delicious. I envy you that you live there and go to school here. I've only been out of this city a handful of times. Wow. I was thinking of volunteering for National Service. You know what that is? - Sure. We have tons of recruits and volunteers in our kibbutz. Are they all secular? Totally secularists. So you don't believe at all? I do, in my own way. What do you believe in? In people. And coincidence. Sounds like a tough way to live. Maybe, but it explains our meeting by chance. Good morning. Are you mad at me? My mom had a talk with me last night. People are talking about you, Rivka, she's afraid you're a bad influence on me. Are you afraid too? I won't lie anymore. You'll tell Yisaschar everything? I'll just say I have no idea where you went. So you're not talking to me anymore? Stop, Rivka, stop. I see you're a dancer now. Just needed to move a bit. Careful not to move in the wrong direction. I will. I found a job for you. I'm not looking for a job. - I don't care. Why not? It's my life. Why don't you care about my life? Why can't I dance in my own home? Why can't I... - Why, why, why? Why are you talking back to your father? Where's that coming from? I'm not talking back, I'm just asking questions. - No questions, no answers. Why not? I'm 19, I'm not a child. Because your father says so. From now on you'll work for me in the shop. What? It's beneath you? Tell your boss that you're leaving in a week. Why didn't you talk to her? By the look on her face I thought that you talked to her. I'm waiting for an answer. I didn't find the right time. By the time you do she'll be 40 years old. For myprecious Prophet Elijah... Sarika, maybe her father is right, maybe she'll have a good life with Shaltiel. Maybe he'll love her because she's young and... maybe his children are nice. Maybe she'll finally forget about those secular friends of hers. Maybe, maybe, maybe and maybe not. Why match her up with a man like that, as if she's a cripple, God forbid. Tell Rivka we're inviting Shaltiel over on Friday night. I want them to meet. His kids love her already. How can they love her? They don't even know her. They heard a lot about her and they love her. They want a maid, a cook, a nanny, for all they care she could have a tail or be bald. They may be your grandchildren one day and already you don't like them? Find her a young, single man, they'll get married and God willing she'll have children of her own. Forget all that nonsense. This is best for her. How can a father do this to his child? I have her best interests at heart. I know exactly what she needs. Can my sister Sarah come too? Better not. You want my sister to be all alone on Friday night? She can go visit your brother Raphael in Tiberias. She can come. But she better watch her mouth. I'll go over to Shaltiel's afterwards. God's reign willnever end. God's reign... Did you tell your family that you dance? No. If they find out, I'll be in trouble. Your brothers or sisters? I don't have brothers or sisters. Such a small family? It's God's will. My mom suffered complications when I was born, she couldn't have anymore kids. Do you do everything you want? I try. Your parents don't butt in? - No. My mom died a few years ago, my dad can't tell me what to do. He wants me to come back to the kibbutz when I graduate. Do you live with him? No, I live alone. I lived with my girlfriend up until a year ago. You weren't married? - No way. We were together for 6 years, marriage was never an option. I'm not even allowed to spend time with you. So how do you meet? The families talk, then we meet, and tell one another about ourselves. I bet they all fell in love with you. - Luckily, I scared them all off. Why? Because I spoke my mind. I didn't come into this world to have babies and be a housewife. You're brave. Not as brave as you think. I have to go home. Hop on, I'll give you a lift. We'll get there much faster. Is something wrong? No, we just came from Dina Seri's party. She had another boy. Good for her. Didn't she tell you? No. That's because you haven't been to synagogue in a long time. Come here. I have to talk to you. We talked to your boss. He said you're hardly ever at work. I had to go somewhere this one time. And lie? You had to lie to your parents? Believe me, I didn't want to lie to you. Where does Rivka Abarbanel go when she's lying? I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm thinking about National Service. I want to volunteer in a hospital or teach kids. You want to go far, Rivka. Lots of girls volunteer. Do they all lie to their parents? Other girls can go, not you. - I want to make something of myself. Something real and important. I like to paint. And dance with seculars? How long have you been doing that? - Just a few times. You've gone too far, Rivka Abarbanel. A girl must stay close to her parents until she marries. A girl that associates with seculars becomes promiscuous. Your father was right. You'll work for him in the shop. I can't, Mother. - Someone has to keep an eye on you. I don't want to sell graters my entire life. We don't only do what we want. Ten minutes with him and I'll lose my mind. You'll get used to it. Like you did? You want me to be like you? Your father thinks... - What now? He thinks he might have... He found you a match. Shaltiel the widower. From the fabric store? He has children. And how. - He's old. He's a widower, of course he's old. - He isn't even 35. He found me a 40-year-old man with kids. - Yes. From home to work, from work to home. I don't need a father like that. - You've said enough. Is this all I'm worth to you? He asked Shaltiel to come over for Friday night dinner. Mom, why are you letting him do this to me? My eyes are burning... Get in the house! She works in the east and I see her heading west. What are you doing? Leave her alone! - Get in your room and don't come out! She's not coming out until she agrees to meet Shaltiel. She can stay in there for 7 years for all I care. Rivka. I'm going to take a shower. Go ahead, sweetie. Good Sabbath. Abarbanel, I have a riddle for you. This man has 25 coins and 6 bags. How will he put an odd number of coins in each bag with no change left over? I'll tell you how. He'll put 5 coins in 5 bags and put all five bags into the sixth bag. That's... -I'm sure you would have figured it out. We have a distinguished guest tonight. I know, I have a riddle for him too. - Not tonight. What's she doing in the bathroom for so long? I have to go get our guests. She's gone! Gone? -She's gone, Sarika, the window's open. You don't have a mezuzah. We don't have mezuzahs in the kibbutz. Don't mind the mess. Where will I sleep? - Here. I'll stay with my dad, we'll figure it out. Thank you. Get some rest, I'll see you later. Aren't you going to synagogue today? It's best if I stay home, in case she comes back. My life means nothing without her. I'd like you to meet Tamar. Tamar, this is Rivka. Tamar's in charge of National Service in the kibbutz. Nice to meet you. Here, it's my daughter's, from before she put on weight. Thank you. - Dubi says you want to volunteer. Very much. - You know what that means... Kind of. -It's a totally different lifestyle than the one you're used to. We'll manage. - I'm just saying. Take whatever you want. I can't eat here, the food's not kosher. Oh yeah, I forgot. All the apples that we grow are organic. We don't spray them with chemicals, and the fertilizer is dry so the tree is much stronger. Thank you. What's wrong? It reminds me of my aunt. She feeds her cat apples. I never heard of a cat that eats apples. Dubi! Here you are at last. What a surprise. This is Rivka. She's here for National Service, I thought she could work in the orchard meanwhile. Don't let us interrupt you. A harbinger unto Zion willl give and to Jerusalem a messenger of good tidings. though I am fallen, I shallarise; though I sit in darkness, God is a light unto me. The Jews had light and gladness, and joy and honor. I willlift up the cup of salvation and call upon the name of God. We beseech Thee, God, save now! Make us now to prosper. Blessed are You, God, King of the universe, Who creates the lights of the fire. Blessed are You, God, King of the universe, Who creates the lights of the fire. Blessed are You, God, King of the universe, Who distinguishes between sacred and secular, between light and darkness, between Israel and other nations, the seventh day and the six days of labor. Blessed are You, God, King of the universe, Who distinguishes between sacred and secular. Naama? Hello. Hello. - I was just thinking about Rivka. She's alright? Yes, she's fine, thank God. I wanted to tell her that I got engaged. That's wonderful news, congratulations. - Thank you. Did she ever talk to you about National Service? Yes, she wanted us both to volunteer. Did she say where? - No. It's been a while since she's been at work, hasn't she? I wish you would have told us. I wish you well. - Thank you. Is this how she danced? - More modest. Did she dance with a guy? She spoke to a guy. Do you see him? No. Let's go. Blessed are You, God, King of the universe... It's delicious. Here you go. - Thank you. Dubi, where are the meat patties, the stuffed vegetables? Rivka can't eat them, let's show her some respect. Do you mind if I eat two meat patties? I mind, eat them later. I'm sorry. Do you live in Jerusalem? - Yes. I hate that city. Too many holy sites and parasites in prayer shawls. Why are you being such a jerk? If I'm a jerk, then you're the jerk's son. Don't pay attention to him. Times are rough, the kibbutz is going through changes and he's not doing so well, but he's a good man. Do you always bicker like that? Kind of. What's this about, Dubi? - What? -You know. She's starting a Yeshiva. Just focus on screwing, man, I hear you're not doing so hot. what do you want to be, girl When you choose to grow up... What's that? This room is a synagogue too. Do you know him? Who? The guy with the Mohican. Why would I know him? I don't know, he keeps looking at you. No, I don't know him. He's from Jerusalem too, I thought he might know you. Can I ask you something? Sure. Why did you come to the kibbutz? You know, to volunteer. Just to volunteer? What do you mean? Is it only me, or is there an attraction between us? We don't talk like that. Then how should we talk? Like you do or like we do? I'm sorry, I don't think I can learn your language so fast. That's okay, I'll wait. I have to go back to Jerusalem to finish my exams anyway. Good night. Good night. Where have you been? I went to visit a sick friend. Have some tea. Blessed are You, God, King of the universe... What a righteous woman. If you think you'll score points with the man above, you've got something else coming. When did Yosef become Yossi? I detected the Yosef in you from first glance. A true diagnostician. How long have you been here? - 6 years. I left the Yeshiva in Jerusalem and never went back. I don't miss anyone. Who are you now? The guy that mixes dairy and meat? I do less kosher things as well. - You sound upset. -Upset? No. I do as I please. You'll get there too, you'll realize that desire is not your enemy. God willing, of course. Hi. How are you? - Fine. Have you heard from Dubi? I've been trying to reach him for a few days. He's busy with exams. You shouldn't disturb him. Worse comes to worst you'll have 10 religious grandkids. You think that's funny, huh? Moron. Hi, Dubi, it's Rivka, how are you? I'm calling to see how you are but you're not answering... Say hello to Jerusalem for me. Thank you. Dubi's still in Jerusalem? - Yes. I hear you're planning on staying, regardless of National Service. Who told you that? - Zeev. He wants to know everything about you. You met the man. Yes, I did. - Then you know what I mean. No, I don't. - He's very protective of Dubi. Protecting him from me? You want my advice? Try not to be too conspicuous. Religion is based on scriptures written thousands of years ago which haven't changed. There are the odd interpretations, but they don't change. On the other hand, science is alive, it breathes, it evolves, it changes. Science voids the authority of religion. The basic difference between them is that religion is based on ancient sources and science is dynamic. It seeks to progress, it seeks the sublime, we're constantly making new discoveries, unlike religion. It's a battle between the old world and the new. He wouldn't be liked where we come from, huh? That's why they're there and we're here. Amen to that. I see you've made progress. I bet you feel more comfortable too. And you didn't turn into a pillar of salt. Loosen up. This feels strange. It's strange you've never been here. Is Dubi afraid to corrupt you? When's he coming back? In a few days. Is it true that you're living together? No, I live alone in his room. But you're his girlfriend. - In what way? You're a couple. Intimate with one another... Why do you ask? No reason. Here it's acceptable. Then what is he to you? He helps me. That's all? It's a lot. I'm glad that's all. Have some. - No. The man above likes happy people. It's a mitzvah. Now you're a believer... I believe that if there's anyone up there, he likes beer too. But there's no one up there. Don't say that. If you're brother had died in agony at the age of 7 you'd think like I do, trust me. I'm sorry. What kind of God lets a 7-year-old die? God works in mysterious ways. That's just it, they're too... mysterious for me. Forget that, who do we drink to? To us? Come on. Cheers. Cheers. Blessed are You, God, King of the universe... Amen. That was fun, wasn't it? Yes. We have the god of beer to thank. Sir. Don't worry. I'm so glad you came back early. I wanted to surprise you. How did the exams go? Couldn't be better. I called you several times but there was no answer. My cellphone died on me. I told my dad to say hello to you. Did he? No. - I see... Very nice. What? That's a new skirt, isn't it? I see you came back in a bad mood. I'm in the best mood ever. Thanks. Wait, I'll walk you home. That's okay. - I want to. Maybe you'll finally invite me in. You scared someone will say that you hang out with men? I don't hang out with men. Yossi, don't walk me, I want to be alone. No problem. I'll find someone who's not afraid to be with me. Good night. They're all turning their backs on me at synagogue. I won't pray with them anymore. I'll go to another synagogue. If I do, you can't stay there. Don't you have anything to say? No. And about the fact that she disappeared? No. Aren't you worried? I am. You say the mail didn't come yesterday. It's best that way. Otherwise I'd know where she is and I'd go and kill her. Yesterday he ignored me as if I was of blessed memory. I added some irrigation pipes while you weren't here. Great. Dubi. What? I thought you people speak your minds. Should I have something on my mind? I don't know. I tried to feel free, I got confused. You got confused kind of quickly. Did anything happen between you two? Not exactly, but... But what? -I may have felt something that I shouldn't have felt. This isn't Jerusalem, you know. It doesn't matter. Did you fuck him? No. It's all good. He turned your head like he does half the girls in the kibbutz. Can I say something in your language? You're an idiot. I like it here and it's not what you think. I missed you. Did I say something funny? Yes. You learned the language real quick. Is anyone here? No. Is anyone here? If my parents would see me now... They'd see their daughter enjoying life. My dad wouldn't see a thing. He doesn't see me. Why not? He can't forgive me for not being a boy. Go to her, Sarika. How can I? The kibbutz is far away. You dream of flying to Venice and you can't take an hour bus drive? As soon the bus gets there I'll crumble. Just don't forget to cover one piece with panties. She sent me a map with directions and she wrote down the bus schedule. What's the problem? - What? Put your finger on Jerusalem. Like this? - Yes. You take a bus from Jerusalem to Kiryat Malachi. I can't reach. - Take your finger off Jerusalem. Take your finger off. The bus passes Kiryat Gat, it travels, travels, travels, travels, travels until it reaches Beer Sheva, and then you take another bus. Another bus? What's this? A map of Venice. I met Shaltiel. Tell him to leave us alone. He still wants her. Hasn't he found himself a wife yet? Be grateful someone wants her. If not for Shaltiel, she's lost, and so are we. Excuse me. I'm looking for Rivka. Yes, Rivka, I know her. I'll bring you to her. Thank you. Do you need a license for this? You see me passing the driving test? - Dear God... It's one of these rooms, I don't know which one is hers. - That's okay. Thank you, take care. Dear God. Excuse me, would you happen to know where Rivka Abarbanel lives? Yes, she's there. Sodom and Gomorrah. Sodom and Gomorrah. Sarah! - Rivka. Look how you're dressed, all the men can see you. It's what we wear around here. Are those your Sabbath shoes?! They're my work shoes. What's with the happy face? Luckily you have ears to stop your smile. Easy, easy. Did you think there's no food in the kibbutz? Do they serve sofrito? Hi, Aunty. This is Dubi, my boyfriend. Nice to meet you. - Your boyfriend? I wrote to you about him in code. What code? I don't understand codes. You have to get back to work, don't you? - Okay. I'm glad you're here, Aunty. Bye. Isn't he the one you met at the dance studio? Yes. Is a wedding in the works? We'll talk about that when the time is right. And until then you're living together? - Yes. Sharing the same bed? It's what people do here. What about honor your father and mother, does that mean nothing here? I do things my way too, but this is going too far, Rivka Abarbanel. I feel that I belong. Blessed are You, God, King of the universe... Your mother made this sofrito for you. No need to add salt, your mom cried into it enough. And why is she crying? - Because of you, what else? If she didn't let him suppress her, he'd wouldn't dare treat me the way he does. That's why she's crying. Stop it, Rivka. Tasty? I want to hear you say a good word about your mother. What mother doesn't visit her daughter because her husband won't allow it... You shouldn't be mad at your mother. As you can see, I'm doing a lot of things I shouldn't do. When I tell your mother, she'll want to jump off the roof. What does it matter what she'll want? She'll only jump if her husband tells her to jump. Rivka, Rivka... What should I tell her? Tell her that her daughter no longer craves bleach. Is she pregnant? - No. But she's living with a guy out of wedlock. -Yes. What will we do, Sarika? If he finds out, he'll kill him. - God forbid! We have to bring her back. Good night, Abarbanel. Thank you, Sarika. - May you hear good news. What's going on here? Rivka. What about her? - She called Sarah. Where is she? - Far away, in a kibbutz. With those ham eaters? I was thinking of going to see her. No. Tell her that if she comes back now, we'll forgive her. A child needs her mother, I'll go get her. You're not going anywhere. Where's your husband? Your father is in Jerusalem. Did he let you come here? Before you disrespect your parents, take a look at yourself. My eyes are burning. Here. Let's go back, Rivka. We won't wait for the bus, we'll take a taxi. What do I go back to, Mom? To your home, of course. The home I ran away from? We were respected by our neighbors before you ran off. Our neighbors never saw what I saw. They never saw you tense up when he walks through the door. How can you feel that way and then go to bed with him? Rivka! Sometimes I had this urge to peek into your bedroom, to see if you're tense when you sleep too. So this is how people talk here? Laying it all out in public...? The sky won't fall, on the contrary. Is this how you're going to live from now on? I didn't say that. What about children? Don't you want kids, Rivka? I have to check out their father first. And what about your mother? I can't come home, Mom. I like it here. Rivka, Rivka... It's so good to see you, thank God. I've missed you. Stay here tonight. I have to get back to your father. Hi. - Hi. Look who's here. My mother. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Hello? - Where's Victoria? Where? - I'm asking you. Did she go to see her daughter? - I don't know. If you didn't know you'd be crying hysterically. I'm crying now. I don't know where she is. - Nothing but lying and scheming. Good night. Good night. Hold on. We haven't done this since you were a child. Do you sleep together in this bed? Yes. What's there to check out after you've slept together? Lots of things. What he's like when he's mad, when he's tired, when he's in a bad mood. A full blown inspection. Who taught you that? You did. - I did... Why do you let him treat you this way? Don't, Mom, don't. You'll hurt your eyes with all that rubbing. My eyes are dry. - Give me your hand. Kid, come here. What are you doing? - She has a cat. Maybe it got in by mistake. Go on, go home. If I see you here again, you'll be punished. I'm sorry. Is Victoria back? - As if you don't know. I'm staying here until you tell me where she is. Damn you! Achashverosh. - Haman. Mom. Are you alright? I can imagine the look on your father's face when he realized I'm not home. Why are you thinking about him? Do you think that if you ask questions you'll get answers? You won't. Why do all your clothes say Duvke, Duvke? Dubka. Dubi and Rivka. You're an item at the cleaner's too? Yes? Put on a dress and come with me. I don't wear dresses anymore. Then pack your things, we're going home. This is my home. - Your home is where your parents are. My mother is here too. - She won't be in an hour. Hi, nice to meet you, I'm Rivka's boyfriend. We don't know you. The bus leaves at 17:00. Pack your bags, we're going home. Let's say I go back with you, you gonna lock me up in the house? After all, the neighbors will talk. We don't care what people say. She should watch her mouth, Victoria, keep her thoughts to herself. Mr. Abarbanel, we don't talk like that here. You be quiet! I didn't come all this way to talk to you. He said we don't talk like that here. - I don't care. And a daughter doesn't talk back to her father. Get your things, you're coming back today. - What for? So you can swear at me? Yell at me? Drag me by the hair? - Be quiet. You too. Get your things, we're going home. I'm staying here for now. Me too. What business do you have here? I'm looking out for our daughter. Mr. Reuven... - You keep away from her. If we were in Jerusalem, I wouldn't let you in my house. Good thing we're not in Jerusalem. Why should I go back? So my father can bury me with a widower and kids? My father who doesn't care who I am and what I want out of life? Who makes jokes about his daughter who drank bleach when she was 14 because she just wanted to die?! I don't fill my mind with nonsense. - Then you're the only one. You know who I felt like? Like Eti from my class, the orphan, we both grew up without a father. We raised you like a queen. Did you ever go to bed hungry? Did you ever sleep in a room full of kids, all freezing to death, while no one cares how you feel? And who worked so hard all these years to support you and your mother if not your father? What about the clothes, the food... were those a gift from heaven? I wake up happy every day, does that mean anything to you? I have a job that I love, I'm going to study art next year at university, I recite "Shema Israel" and give thanks every day. If you really want what's best for me say the blessing of praise and apologize for wanting to marry me off to the lamest men in the neighborhood. I didn't come here for this. Sometimes you come with certain intentions and realize you've made a mistake. I didn't come here for this. We know why you came here. If you won't change your mind, you can go. You're coming home. You're coming home right now! Hey, hey, hey! Let go of me! You're coming home with me now! Sarah... Sarika. You can go back to Jerusalem on your own. I'm not going anywhere with you and I'm not going back to your home. I wanted to talk to you in private. What's there to talk about? You do what you want. There's nothing for me to do here. I'm going back to Jerusalem. You should be proud of your daughter. She's mean tempered and rude just like her mother. She hasn't forgotten where she grew up. Everything I did was for her. I wanted her to have a husband who would care for her. No matter who the man is? - They're all the same. The man works, the wife makes fun of him behind his back. You should be grateful for what you have. Doesn't the Bible say that? Reuven, let's go back. So no one says you gave up. I don't care what they say. Blessed are You, God, King of the universe, who creates the fruit of the tree. - Amen. Amen. - Bon Appetit.
