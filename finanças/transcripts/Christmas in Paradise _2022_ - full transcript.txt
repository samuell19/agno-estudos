Oh... We are gonna have the most peaceful Christmas this year. - Just the three of us. - Yes. You're sure your parents don't mind that we're not going to them this year? They're fine, darling. I told them we'll see them in the New Year. Oh, good. I just couldn't face the journey. I mean, this little munchkin is enchanting, but she's exhausting. Plus, I hate the holidays. I just find everyone so annoying. Well, we are going to be alone. Hmm. My family were pretty appalling last year, weren't they? Your family are mad. I know. But it all ended well, darling. - I love you. - I love you. Hello. Who is this?! It's Caroline. Your sister? Caroline, are you insane calling this late? Joanna, what are you talking about? It's not late, it's 8 PM. I left you three messages, and you never called me back. Is that Chloe crying? Who else would it be? She was sleeping and you have woken her up. God knows how long it's gonna take me to get her down again. Well, I am sorry, but why do you keep a phone in her bedroom? It's absurd. She was in bed with me, Caroline. Now, what do you want? Have you heard from Vicky? No, of course I haven't spoken to Vicky lately. - She's off in Tibet, finding herself. - Shh... Of course. I'm in London. We need to call an emergency sisters meeting. Oh, God. What has the Christmas family done now? It's Dad! He's disappeared! What? Again? Sisters! Come in quick. I've got milk on. I haven't slept a wink since you called. I am exhausted. All I do is pick up all this stuff, bring it here, and the second I turn around again, it's just come back. Oh, yeah. Okay, Caroline, my tree isn't decorated. Can you just stop staring at it? I wasn't. - Yes, you were. - I only bought it yesterday. It's lovely. She's adorable. Yeah. She's Daddy's little girl. So, it's good to see you in London, Caroline. How's everything at the manor? Oh, you know, wonderful. Okay, can we just start this emergency sisters meeting? Okay, that's my cue to leave. - No, baby. Baby, stay. - No, it's fine. It's perfectly fine. I'll be with little baby girl upstairs if you need me. Come on, bubba. Let's leave Mummy to talk with her sisters. I had a call two days ago from Jackie. We've kind of developed a friendship. - Really? - Really. And guess what? She and Dad broke up two months ago. Dad told her that he wasn't in love with her anymore and he told her to pack her things and leave. Just like that? You see? He finally saw through her. And I saw through her the minute I met her, remember that. Well, actually, I think she's rather sweet. I mean, when I spoke to her yesterday, she seemed very sad about the whole thing. And she's terribly worried about Dad. - You've spoken to her too? - Yes, of course. Anyway, she's been trying to call him for days and he's just completely disappeared. The neighbors went round to the house, and it's all closed up. But Jackie went to the house, and she had a quick look at Dad's credit card statements. And Dad has made several payments from a hotel in Nevis, in the Caribbean. I've tried to call him there, he's not taking any calls. Completely disappeared. I think Dad is having a massive emotional reaction. He must be totally depressed. What... what does Mum say about all this? Well, Mum's on a cruise in the Nile with Uncle John. - Ugh. - Yes, but it's fine. It's fine. Everything's fine. Why? Why is it fine? Well, because I booked tickets for the three of us. We're going to the Caribbean this afternoon. What? Yes. Boost Dad's morale, perk him up a bit, and we'll all be back here in England by the 22nd, just in time for Christmas. - You two are insane. That is a... - It's a wonderful idea. I couldn't help but listen. Darling, you need to do this. You know, go find your dad, get some sun, and come back for Christmas. There is no way I am leaving you two. That would make me a terrible mother. You're a wonderful mother. But you need a break. It's only for a few days. And you do look a little bit... What? - Exhausted. - Mm-hmm. Really? Well, I mean... Okay, I... I could do with a bit of sleepy time. Definitely, sweetheart. Jolly good. You might want to start packing. The flight leaves at four. - Four? - What? Oh, baby. Mummy has to leave you, darling. And she's never left you before, but she has to go with her annoying sisters. Okay, girls, let's do it. Great. Let's go save Dad. Whoo! Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for my brother, Mr. James Christmas! Jimmy Ray Love! - Thanks, man. - Great job, man. Mr. Christmas, great name for the holidays, right? - Can I get a "ho ho ho"?! - Ho ho ho! - Ho ho ho! - Ho ho ho! One, two, three, four! Whoo! Wow, Megan, you've got some serious moves out there. Well, you can say the same for yourself, James. I love the Caribbean twist on that song. Excuse me, boss. Do you mind if I interrupt this magical moment to take your drink order? Frank, you killed it. Couple of your famous margaritas, please. I just made two. Coming right up. You staying for Christmas? - Oh, that's like a week away, isn't it? - Mm-hmm. I made a promise to myself I wouldn't plan anything that far ahead anymore. Well, if you can plan as far as this afternoon, maybe you could join us at the beach yoga session. Our teacher, Vaughn, is very good. Okay, I'm in. Well, Mr. Rhythm, you got yourself a date. Jimmy! Hey, James! What you doing out here? Come on up, man! Let me buy you a drink! Sweet spot you got here. You're looking at the new owner of this little piece of paradise. I haven't exactly moved in yet, but I'm spending more and more time here. Congratulations. Mind if I ask you a private question? Sure. You're a big star back in America. Why are you hiding out on a little Caribbean island, singing in a beach bar? I reckon everybody on this island is asking that same question. I wouldn't know. I don't really take part in gossip. I'll be honest with you, my friend. Back in the day... I woke up every morning just living to write another song. Music was everything. I wrote a bunch of songs. And got damn lucky a couple times. Real lucky. But my Dad always said, "I'd rather be lucky than good." He was right about that. Anyhow... what goes up must come down. Yeah, I learned that the hard way. Music business... became all about the business. Music just got lost. I dried up. Couldn't write a damn song if I had to. Just wasn't inspired. One day I got to thinking... music is a common thread between the heart and soul and the universe. Yeah. Anyway... I'm still searching. I just don't know what I'm searching for. But I'll tell you one thing that changed. When I came here? I was at peace. Just loved it here. And I never left. I'll drink to that. Right on, my brother. I hope Dad is on this island. That's it. Breathe. Let the majesty of the island feel it. Inhale... Exhale out. That's good. Listen to the silence. I can't believe you didn't make us a reservation at the hotel. It would have tipped him off that we were coming, and knowing Dad, he would have just disappeared to another island or something. Well, okay, but we better find him before Christmas because I need to get back to my baby. I know. But we had to come here and find Dad. I mean, we... we don't know where he is. It can't be that difficult. It's a very small island. Listen to the silence. Dad! Dad?! Look! Look at over there! Dad! Dad! Dad! - Dad! - Daddy! Daddy, it's us! Dad! Ladies, we're having a yoga session here. - Oh, dear Lord. - Please. - Dad! Dad! - Do you know these people? - I'm afraid I do. - Dad! I'm so sorry. I have to go. It's not a problem. Sorry. - Dad! Come on! - All right! You three! Dad! Dad, what are you doing here? What does it look like I'm doing? I'm doing yoga on the beach. - Well, yeah, we can see that. - We have been worried sick about you. Dad, you're doing yoga? - What are you doing here, girls? - Well, you totally disappeared. Jackie rang me. She was in a complete panic. All right. I told Jackie that she was too young for me. She had to move on with her life. Dad, we don't care about Jackie. We care about you. Yes. We've called the hotel so many times. I've left so many messages. Can't a man disappear without being hunted down by his nosy daughters? - No. - You see? This is what our father is like. Joanna, what are you even doing here? What about Felix and Chloe? They're at home, in London. And I'm here because these two nutcases imagined you lying half dead on a beach somewhere. I am here to rescue you, Daddy. Aren't you just a little bit happy to see us, Dad? Of course I am. Come here. Give me a hug. All right. Get you all checked in. Once you're settled in, we have a lot to discuss. Now that's what I call a family. Hey, it's me. Hey. Hi, honey. You made it, then. Oh, look at that beautiful little baby. As you can see, we've got a crying baby. - It's good. Have you found your dad yet? - Hey. Hey. Yeah, Dad is absolutely fine. Can you believe it? He was doing yoga on the beach when we arrived. Yoga? Good for him. Look, darling, I've got a crying baby here. I think she's hungry. Oh, well, kiss her for me. Does she miss me? Of course she does. It's all right. Say bye-bye to Mummy. - Love you. - Bye-bye. Look, get some sleep. I've gotta go. All right. Miss you. - So? - Hey, Daddy. How is my little granddaughter doing? Oh, Daddy, she is just gorgeous. - Do you have a picture? - I do. There. Look at that, that was yesterday. Ah. I mean, don't get me wrong. She's a handful. No surprise there. Look who her mother is. Well, she's adorable. - How's Felix doing? - He's fine. Oh. And you? How are you, my daughter? I'm fine. Though, I am pretty stressed most of the time. I mean, having a baby is wonderful. But it's a bit like being in the eye of a storm. It's magnificent, fabulous... but scary. I don't know if I'm doing everything right, Dad. I mean, there's just so much for me to remember. Some of the time, I just self-indulgently throw myself on the sofa and cry. - Does that make me a bad mum? - Not at all. Your mother and I were lost when you came along. We were just 17 years old. Your mother was scared senseless. But you'll see, it gets easier day to day. - Sure? - Absolutely. It's the circle of life. Now get up, I told your sisters to meet us at my favorite place in Nevis for a drink. Are you okay, Dad? Of course. Come on, let's go. I swear, the first diaper I changed nearly made me pass out. I mean, she seemed such a tiny little thing. Where did it all come from? Whereas Felix, he took to it like a duck to water. Honestly, I really think they have some little secret sign language going on behind my back. Having a child changes a woman. It brings out the best in her. Are you saying, I was any different before? What? No. Not at all. - Caroline? - Hmm? How about you and Peter? How are things with you two? Oh, well... after last year's crisis, things are just perfect. We now have sex twice a week, Saturdays and Wednesdays. Oh, gosh, you probably mark it down in your awful little planner. Oh, I don't need to. I have an alert on my phone. I never knew that shopping for sexy lingerie could be quite so exciting. You have no idea how many shades of red there are. Unbelievable! She'll be telling us what he says in bed next. "Yes." That's what he says in bed. - Yes. - God. What has become of my... my nomad, runaway, insane daughter Vicky? Where is she? What's up? Well, she's in Tibet... or India. One of them. Anyway, she's on an ashram studying meditation and getting in touch with her inner self. Or with her guru's outer self. You know you can never change a free spirit, Joanna. You of all people should know that. And you, you ditched this whole Beatle thing? Yeah. I finished my thesis, and I shed my Fab Four persona. Yes. And this... this new skin you're sporting is...? Can't you tell? Only the greatest female blues singer of the '60s. - Janis Joplin! - Ah. I am writing a book about her days in Haight-Ash bury. San Fran, Woodstock, that whole thing. - Fascinating. - Promise me... at some point, you'll take the time to think about you, Paulina. That beautiful girl inside. She deserves to see the world too, you know. What about that girl that, you know, the pretty girl that you met at... at the bar? The... the really cute one when we all went out and got drunk at the local pub. Oh, gosh, what a night that was. Yeah, when Jackie nearly blew your house up. We broke up. I believe I've evolved. Okay, so speaking of breaking up, Dad, why don't you tell us all about Jackie? Yes. She seemed so good for you. Was she? Well... yes. Yes, she was. But we... evolved too. I had to let her go... in favor of some... new beginnings. But what's important is now. This very moment, I am on a Caribbean island... with three of my magnificent four daughters, and I couldn't be happier. This couldn't be more beautiful, more wonderful. To the Christmas family. - Christmas family. - Christmas family. Cheers. Oh, my God! It can't be, can it? What? What is it, Paulina? Spit it out. Only one of the greatest country singers of all time. Jimmy Ray Love! Jimmy. Jimmy, come on over here, and say hi to my daughters. Come on. Come on, sit here, Paulina. How you doing, my friend? This is Jimmy. This is Caroline... Joanna... and Paulina. And, um, there is a fourth one wandering about somewhere in search of her inner consciousness or something. Well, well, well, James, aren't you full of surprises? Actually, not. I knew the second I saw 'em get off that boat down there. - These your kids. - They also said Dad. Well, that was a good call. Anyway, it's nice to meet you girls. I am just floored that my Dad knows Jimmy Ray Love. Yeah. Well... it's actually just the opposite of that. I'm honored to know your dad, call him my friend. Everybody on this island will tell you the exact same thing. "Tell Me That You Love Me." I love that song so much. Me too. I love it too. Yes. Well, here's to... legendary songs sung by legendary singers. - Yes. - Legendary songs. - Yeah. - Cheers. Joanna! Joanna! - Oh... - Morning! For God's sake, Caroline. I was asleep. Oh, well, now you're awake. What do you want? Wasn't last night wonderful? Well, yeah, if you don't have a massive hangover. Oh. It's so lovely here. I can see why Dad enjoys it. You know, Caroline, I will pay you anything if you just let me go back to sleep for an hour. Good morning, girls. Oh. Another glorious day in paradise. Hello, Dad. Nice to see that somebody's up and at it. Yes. Well, this is your first day and your introduction to the island. First up, a boat ride on a catamaran. - Ooh. - A catamaran? - Yes, it's a multihull boat. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Caroline. I know what a catamaran is. But if I'm gonna go out under this burning orb, I'm gonna need to borrow some sunscreen. I didn't have time to buy any. I have some in my cabin, just help yourself. I'm gonna go out and get some coffee. We leave in one hour. Time to get dressed. Chop-chop. I hate you. Oh, my... How long have you known? A few months ago, I was feeling very tired. I had them run some tests, and it turned out I had cancer. - Does Jackie know? - No. I never told her. I... I didn't want her to be around, not to see any of this. Dad, you need to get treatment. You can't stay here. You... you have to come home with us. No. I'm not doing chemo. I'm not gonna waste away on some hospital bed in London. I'm gonna deal with this on my own terms... watching the sun rise and set, right here. Listen to me. I need you to promise me something. I need you to swear that you will not tell your sisters. - I can't do that. - Yes, you can. Let me enjoy these couple of days with my beautiful daughters. Do this for me. Let this be my Christmas present. - Please. - It's a lot to ask. I know. But I believe I can trust you to make that promise. Yes? Okay. Now, don't we have a... boat ride in a couple of minutes? I... I love you. I love you more. So... four daughters? You certainly kept that one quiet. You really are a man of mystery, Mr. Christmas. Well, not really, Megan. You see, honestly, I carry a bit of shame about my daughters which lasted until they forgave me just last Christmas. Several years ago, my wife fell in love with my older brother. - I'm sorry. - Yeah. And rather than having them watch me self-destruct, I... I left them. Well, they are here now. And they must love you very much. Megan seems like a nice person. Mm-hmm. - But? - But what? Well, usually when you make that noise, there's a "but." - No, not at all. But... - There you are. Don't you think it's just a little too soon after Jackie? If Dad wants to have fun, he should have fun. It's none of our business. Who are you, and what have you done with Joanna? I still think we should find out more about her, though. - Start digging. - Why is it always me? Because you look so sweet and innocent, and nobody suspects you. Wow. Some light, huh? Another wonderful day. So, Megan, are you and my Dad together? Oh, my God! I can't believe she just asked that. No, we're not. Megan and I are just friends, Paulina. Friends are good. Happy now? And what about you, Paulina? Joanna and Caroline seem happily married. Oh, I'm... I'm single. And I'm a lesbian. Ah. How about you, Megan? Well, my parents aren't around anymore. But even though I'm alone, I could never leave the island. Nevis is my home. So, no husband then? No. But I have been in love. You know, before this interrogation gets any sillier, I'm going swimming. Hang on to that for me, will you? Yes, he is... - Oh, he really is. - Oh! Aw... Come on in, girls! This is amazing. Y'all sing it now! Whoo! The Christmas family! It was quite an eventful day. Yes. Dad, thank you so much. Well, thank Megan. She put together the best parts. I have an idea. Why don't y'all share one of your favorite Christmas memories with us? Um... Yeah, I have one. I'd love to hear it. I was five, I think. I was rooting around Dad's record collection. All these wonderful old vinyls. And I closed my eyes, and I pulled out a random album. When I opened them, it was Tamia Motown's Christmas Greats. And I put the record on, and Dad came in and he caught me dancing to the Jackson Five, singing "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town." He was laughing his head off. And when I was done... he gave me the album to keep. My first ever record. I still have it. What about you, Megan? Ah, I'm not really one for reminiscing. Oh, come on. You must have one memory to share. Well... I do remember one Christmas Eve when my father was helping my mother put up the Christmas tree, and he suddenly just stopped and kissed her. I never knew anyone to kiss with so much love as they did. - Your turn, Caroline. - Oh, no. Don't open Pandora's box. Oh, stop it. It's easy. Last Christmas. After being away for 15 years, Dad came back, and we were a family again. And it was crazy and chaotic... but it was perfect. Joanna. My favorite Christmas memory... You don't have to say it, Joanna. Oh, but I do. It was snowing. Mum had taken the other girls to the Christmas fair, leaving just me and Dad home together. So, we snuggled up and we watched a Christmas movie on TV. Then Dad said, "Get your coat and gloves. We're gonna go out and build a snowman for your sisters." I was so excited, and we built the biggest snowman ever. Then Dad picked me up and he said... Do you remember what you said? I said I would always love you and protect you... and I would never, ever leave you. That's right. You know what, Dad? You never did leave me. You were with me every minute... of every day of my life. What about you, Jimmy Love? - For real? - Yeah. My favorite Christmas memory... this one. Watching y'all be the family I never had. Morning, Daddy. You're up early. Oh, I want to make the most of this trip. What's the plan for today? Let's start with some breakfast. I'm stuffed. - Is this you or me? - You. Ah. - Good morning, Mr. Christmas. - Good morning, Vanessa. - You didn't forget me, right? - How could I forget you? If you've finished breakfast, shall we? - We shall, indeed. - Where are we going? Come along, girls. Vanessa runs a program for kids. Oh, program for kids. How old is she? So, we bake the cookies. And then we deliver them to the older people in our community who can't go out and shop for themselves anymore. We do this because... Sharing is caring! I'm sorry, children... I... I've gotten so old I... I can barely hear what you're saying. Would you mind repeating that, please? Sharing is caring! Eh? Sharing is caring! Oh, that's better. Go ahead, Leo. Is your last name really Christmas? Yes. My name is James Christmas. Do you know Santa personally? I'd have to say that Santa and I have a very special bond. I hope he likes our Christmas cookies. Oh, I'm sure he will, Jackson. Well, kids, I think we should say a huge thanks and a big applause to Mr. Christmas! - Yeah! - Thank you, Mr. Christmas! Thank you. Thank you, children. Now we gotta go deliver these cookies, and I tell you what. Cenita, Jackson, Christian, Leo, you come with me. Caroline, you will ride shotgun. Come on, kids. Let's get ready to deliver these cookies. Good, kids. Good job. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Go ahead up the stairs, kids. Give them cookies. - There you go. - Merry Christmas. Thank you, thank you. They're so pretty. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Oh, this is lovely. Dad, you okay? What's up? Suddenly, I don't feel very good. Uh... Would you mind driving home? No, of course. You don't look very well. I... I just need to rest a little. I probably ate something bad. I'll be fine. You're burning up a little. - They're good kids, aren't they? - Yes. Yes, they are. You know, I never ever meant to hurt you, Caroline. You do know how much I love you and your sisters, don't you? Of course. - I, uh, need to lie down. - I'm gonna take a nap. We can, uh, have some dinner tonight. Okay. Get some rest. What's going on? I don't know. Something's up. We were delivering cookies, and everything was fine, and then he started coughing, and he has a fever. He's resting. What is it, Joanna? - Nothing. - You're lying. What? Why is she lying? She knows something. Spit it out. I can't. I made a promise. What promise? Joanna. Tell us. Please. Okay. Yeah. Let's... let's go sit down. Well? Dad has cancer. You're not serious? I'm not gonna joke about something like this, am I? No, no, of course not, but... When? How? - Caroline, what are you doing? - I'm calling Vicky. - No, no, no, no, no. - I mean, she has to know. I have to call her. No, she has to know! Please stop! Our Daddy is sick. I can't believe this. When did you find out? Yesterday. But he made me promise not to tell you both. He just wants to enjoy this time with his daughters. Well, obviously Jackie doesn't know, otherwise she'd be here. What are we gonna do? Look, you two have to behave as if you don't know. - What? - Please. I promised. We can't just ignore the fact that he's sick, finish our little vacation and wave goodbye for the last time. Can we? Absolutely not. Here's what we're going to do. We're gonna keep his secret. But the three of us have to do everything we possibly can to show him how precious he is to us. And we have to convince him to come back to England with us so he can get treatment and we can take care of him. Agreed? - Agreed. - Agreed. Okay, we have a mission to accomplish. Absolutely. Of course we do. Father Christmas is not dying on our watch. - Hi, darling. - Hey. Hi, sweetheart. How's my little girl? Oh, she's fast asleep. You okay? - Not really. - What's wrong? It's Dad. He's got cancer. Oh, no. Oh, honey. Babe, I'm so sorry. You are gonna bring him home, right? I'm not sure. Look... Honey, um... anything you need, I'm here for you, okay? I love you. I love you too. Kiss that little baby for me. Of course. I'm gonna go. I don't really feel like talking now, but... I'll call you later, okay? Okay. Love you. Lots of love. Bye. - Yeah? - Hey, my brother. Hey, Jimmy. How are you, man? What are you and your girls doing tonight? - I don't think we have anything planned. - Oh, really? Why don't you let me treat y'all to a big dinner down at Sunshine's? Maybe some of that house rum of his, if you know what I'm saying? Well, that's awfully nice of you. It might be a nice way to send the girls off. Okay, then. Well, I'll see you when you get here. We'll see you later. Thanks. Do you ever run out of amazing places here? - It's incredible. - What are these? It's a homemade rum, made with a secret ingredient. - What secret ingredient? - Sunshine. Oh. It's called a Killer Bee. You gotta be careful, they're dangerous and addictive. Here's to Killer Bees and the island of Nevis. Killer Bees! - Nevis. - Nevis. - There's Sunshine now. - Hey, there. We're gonna need some more Killer Bees. More Killer Bees be right up. - Thank you. - Thank you, sir. - Be right back with your food. - Thank you. Thank you, sir. Well done. Well, seems like y'all know a lot about me, so how about I learn a little bit about you all? Carolina, is it true you live in a castle? Oh, that old thing. Yes. But really, it just was passed down through my husband's family. You know, 16th century, go off, fight a war, come back, get a castle for your troubles. Joanna, what about you? Oh, well, I am a fashion editor. And I'm also mummy to a beautiful little girl. Now, you and this Janis thing. If it's just a phase, it's working for you. And if you gonna be somebody, be Janis, I always say. Oh, you didn't see her during her Beatles phase. She had a mop top for a long time. It was only for 10 years, Caroline. When I was a little girl, I fell in love with The Beatles, especially Paul. And when I grew up, I chose to do my thesis on them. I consider myself a bit of a method writer. I like to live in their style, you know? I think it helps the process. - Cheers. To the process. - Very proud of you. - Cheers. - Whoo. - Whoa. - Oh, wow. - Sunshine. - Look at that. - Yes, I am. - Yum. Oh, Dad. - Good night. - Night, Jimmy Ray. Good night, girls, James! - How you feeling, Dad? - Great. I'm content. I have my three girls with me. - I do get it, you know. - What's that? The pull of this place. It's like paradise. I think I had too many Killer Bees. You know what? I miss Vicky. Oh, I know. I tried calling her, but she answers her phone like once a month. Well, let's send her a video message, the four of us. - Oh. - That's a good idea. - Paulina, you will be the cameraman. - Yeah. I have my phone. - Okay. - Okay. Go. Hi, Vicky! - Hi, hun. - We miss you. Listen. I... I miss you, sweetheart, every day. And I... I just want to say, you know, be safe, and I... I want you to have a wonderful life. I love you. - We love you. - We love you. - Stay safe. - Bye. Bye. Sent. Oh, yes. You know what you should do, Dad? You should come back to England with us - and have Christmas there. - Yes. No, no. I don't think so. I... the weather does not agree with me. It's not that bad. Don't you want to have Christmas with us, Daddy? Well, then, I'll do one better. Why don't we all stay and have Christmas here? - Yes! - Yes? Oh, we could bring everyone out. Peter and the Kids. Uh, Felix and Chloe. - Yes. And Vicky and Mum and Uncle John. - Yes. All right, all right. Let's not get carried away. Caroline, don't go changing your Christmas traditions. I know how important they are to you. No. Come on, Caroline can live dangerously for one year, - can't you, Caroline? - Yes. Yes, yes, I can. Come on, Dad. Say yes. - May I sleep on it? - Okay. - I'm going to bed. Good night, ladies. - Yeah, all right. - Good night. - Good night, Dad. What do we think? I don't know. I don't want to lose my Daddy. You told them. They're your daughters, Dad. They needed to know. Why don't you go sleep on that? Good night. - Good morning, ladies. - Morning. Where's my Dad? Your father left you this note. Thank you. "Meet me here." And an address. Oh, gosh. - What is this place? - I bought it. I'm thinking about slapping a fresh coat of paint on it. Best view on the island, and that rhythm is just perfect. Now, if you three would kindly be seated, I have something to explain to you. This thing I have, this cancer. It's in my head. It's called a meningioma. It started with headaches and dizziness, a couple of blackouts. They have to monitor its growth. When it reaches a certain size, the only option is to operate. If and when that happens, I will have to decide what to do. If I choose to do that, then I will decide where to have the operation. Until then, I am staying here. So you slept on our suggestions and ignored them. I want you to go back to your families... and to your dreams. And it is not because I don't love you, it's because I want you to remember me like this. It's not fair. You know perfectly well you would get much better treatment at home, with all of us around you. How could you do this to us? I do not want you to change your life for me. And more importantly, I do not want you to watch me fade away. I will not allow it. That's why you will be getting on that plane in the morning. That's why you left Jackie, isn't it? Yes. Jackie is a vibrant, beautiful young woman. Her time is better spent elsewhere. So, you're basically just pushing away everybody who's ever loved you. It's so selfish! It's not fair. You can't just ask us to leave, just like that. "Bye, Dad. See you at your funeral." Cancer is treatable. And I waited so long to have you back in my life, and now I'm going to lose you again, but this time forever. You're not gonna lose me. I promise. Oh. Hello, Leo. Hi, Mr. Christmas. I have a question for you. Go ahead. Would you please be my instructor for my sailing class today? Of course. Is it okay if I bring my daughters along too? - Okay. - Very well then. See you soon. Mm-hmm. Bye. I heard you are leaving the island soon. You know... they want the children on the island to love and respect the water as much as they love and respect each other. Yeah. Yeah, I can see that. You have to keep the boat straight. I know. I'm trying. Just has a mind of its own. Ooh. Oh! We're getting it, we're getting it! - Am I doing okay? - Yes, you're doing great. - Then why are you staring at me? - Your eyes are beautiful. You look like a princess to me. Oh, sweetheart. You're the princess. Come on. Mr. Christmas, can I ask you something? Do you have a girlfriend? Tough question, Leo. What makes you ask such a thing? My Mom was wondering. I heard her asking her friend. I see. So, do you have one? Uh... I, uh... Well... Mom! Mr. Christmas doesn't have a girlfriend! Where's your dad, Leo? Gone. My parents are divorced. I think you'd make a great dad. Well, that's... That's very kind of you, Leo. Uh, why don't we just focus on the sailing for now, huh? - Okay. - You ready to come about? Yep! It's obvious, right? Yes. Yes, it is. Great sailing, everybody! Well done. Give yourselves a hand. Now, listen up, you squabs, I'm buying each and every one of you some ice cream. - On me, let's go! - Yay! Get that ice cream. Paulina. How is it possible to feel so sad and so happy at the same time? I've never felt like this before. None of us have. Well, the weather's turned, but look at that view. You don't get a view like that in London, do you? No, you don't. What about you, Megan? You ever been to London? A few times. I really love the energy, but it's a little too busy for me. Everyone has their favorite place, but it's often accompanied by their favorite person. Hmm. Don't you agree, Dad? If you're in your perfect place, it's best to be with somebody you love? I know what you mean. There's no point being in paradise if you've no one to share it with. Yes. Quite. What about you, little sister? Have you been enjoying the sights? Very much. Very much indeed. Oh. Excuse me, everyone. Hang on. Hello? Hello? Hang on. Hello? Hang on a sec. Let me just get better reception. Hang on. Hey. Hi, honey. Hi. Gosh, it is really cold here right now. Oh. Well, this might warm you up. Oh, that is amazing. Wow. So, is your dad coming home? No, actually. No? Yeah, he's bought himself this... beautiful little beach house and he's gonna stay right here. That's a pity. Anyway, I've got some great news for you. Your old boss Michael, he called this morning. He wants you to be chief editor of the new magazine he's launching! Oh, my God. Really? Really! Honey. This is everything you ever wanted. Yeah. Yeah, it is. I can feel a "but" coming. You know, when I came to this island years ago... I don't think I believed in anything. Now, I believe in everything. Most of all, the miracle of Christmas. ♪ Silent night ♪ ♪ Holy night ♪ ♪ All is calm ♪ ♪ All is bright ♪ ♪ Round yon Virgin ♪ ♪ Mother and child ♪ ♪ Holy infant ♪ ♪ So tender and mild ♪ ♪ Sleep ♪ ♪ In heavenly ♪ ♪ Peace ♪ ♪ Sleep ♪ ♪ In heavenly ♪ ♪ Peace ♪ ♪ Silent night ♪ ♪ Holy night. ♪ Merry Christmas, everybody. God bless you. Thank you, Jimmy Ray Love, for that moving rendition of this sacred song. There is no more beautiful time of the year than Christmas. We are three days away from the birth of a child that completed the most holy of families. And that is what I want to talk to you about tonight... Family. We are all the product of a father and a mother. And no matter the circumstances of our birth, we all breathe in the miracle of life and the goodness of God. You may travel to a faraway place, you may have dreams that take you along an unknown path, you may find love there, or hope... but you never let go of the memories of family that lies locked here in your heart. You never let go of the love you have for them. And even when we get older, we cherish and hold on to the memories that we share with one another. And those memories, we hope, will never fade away. So, I would like you to join hands as one family tonight, under the moon and the stars, and give thanks for our families, and pray that we never let them go. - Amen. - Amen. Amen. Brother Love? - Amen! - Amen! I feel a lot of change coming on, James. What do you mean? I guess you could call it this old country boy's intuition. - Fancy a walk? - Sure. You know, I used to take long walks with my granddad years ago. Yeah. - Down to the liquor store? - No, sir. You three look like you're up to no good. Dad, you know that call I had earlier with Felix? Well, I heard that I've been offered my dream job... A fashion publisher. That's wonderful. Congratulations. But I'm not gonna take it. But it's your dream job. I am gonna move here for a year. With Felix and Chloe. And don't even try to make me change my mind. You've always taught us to follow our dreams, and... my dreams changed. I want you to get to know your granddaughter. And I really want her to know you. And live with you for a while. I don't know what to say. I think it's a wonderful idea. You should be happy, Dad. I am happy, especially to meet my new granddaughter. Being with those kids today just made me realize that that's the sort of life I want for my daughter. And we're going to visit too. Peter's thrilled at the idea. Of course, I am going to have to stock up on sunscreen, because he's almost as pale as I am. And what about you? Do you have some reason for returning to the island other than to see your dear old dad? Let's just say I have my reasons. - Ah. - Hmm. Hmm. You're sure about this? - Yep. - Yes, we are. Hmm. Family need to stick together. Agreed? Agreed. You girls... Yes, I agree. - Merry Christmas! - Yay! Are you sure you're going to be okay until we get back? I promise. Everything will be fine. I'm sure Chloe's going to love it here. I'm so proud of you. It seems someone has come to say goodbye to the real Paulina. What? Go on. She's waiting for you. So this is what the real Paulina looks like. Yes. Sorry. It's not quite as dramatic as Janis, or the Beatles, for that matter. I wanted to give you something. Thank you. I'll be waiting for you. I have to go. All right. Well, it's time to say goodbye. Come on, let's have a hug. - Love you. - Love you too. All right, you two. Have a good trip. - We'll see you soon. - Bye. Off they go. And floor it. Bye! We love you. Bye! That was pretty great. - It'll be okay. - Yes, I know. - I can't believe we're leaving Dad. - I know. It was a really special time. I love you. Oh! - It's Jackie. - Why is she calling? Jackie? No, we just left him. What?! No! - What? - No! - We have to go back! - Why?! We have to go back! Turn around! - Why? - We have to go back! Why?! Turn the boat around! - What?! - Turn the boat around! What are they doing? Wait there, wait there! We're coming! I don't know. I mean... Dad! Dad! - What? - What? Jackie called. She's pregnant!
