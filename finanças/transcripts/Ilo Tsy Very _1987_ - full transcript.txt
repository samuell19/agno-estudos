Eternal oiliness In the 19th century, Madagascar was an independent country. It had its own rules and laws about organization and development. It had agreements with foreign people through embassies. The diversity of customs and cultures made the people proud. It had inherited wisdom from Asia and Africa. The people could not stand the slightest restriction of freedom or independence. The "red book" affirms... Madagascar was not similar to the other colonies. Before 1896... it could supply its own needs. Still, its history led it to some failures. The 19th century also... was marked by the beginnings of European capitalism. English and French were competing. In the Indian Ocean, they both wanted to take possession of Madagascar. The French army attacks Madagascar for no reason. This vile policy will go on. The Malagasy government is forced to accept... that France will administer the Malagasy foreign policy. They will call it a "protectorate". Actually, France began to administer the interior policy too. Jules Ferry, minister of foreign affairs, stated that... "For the rich countries, colonies are..." "investments that must be profitable." "European companies are facing a crisis. Colonies should be able to generate profit." "This is why we need Tunisia, Saigon and Cochin China." "And that's why we need Madagascar too." "We're already in Diego-Suarez. And we will never leave." The French army attacks Madagascar again. The Malagasy State tried to resist. But its lack of strength could only lead to a defeat. 6th of August 1896 The French parliament votes. 77 deputies decide that... Madagascar and connected island have become French colonies. General Galli?ni, chosen to govern Madagascar, declares... "Madagascar is a French land. There is no point denying it." "Malagasy are now French. Only the French flag..." "is allowed to be put up. Even is the furthest places." That day... the Malagasy people started to live under a new regime: colonization. The people did not accept the intrusion in his state. Neither the regression of its rights. The people condemned the violence and the abuses it suffered. The Menalamba revolt occurred in the center of the country. In 1896... Menabe, Ikongo, Mahafaly, Begogo... then Sadiavahy in the East, Antsihanaka and Bezanozano... Betsileo and the others... It lasted until 1915. So as to take advantage of the Malagasy... men from 16 to 6 years-old were reduced to forced work. They built a rail road to transport French soldiers and wares. French also imposed several taxes. Lands were seized and people were turned into indigenous. Such laws were enforced to regiment and restrain the people. The SMOTIG was slavery hidden behind so-called community service. The Great War broke up between France and Germany. All the colonies, including Madagascar, were forced to take actions. 45,000 men were sent to the front. Jean Ralaimongo was one of them. When the war ended, he joined the democrats. He fought against colonialism and imperialism... together with people from other colonies. In Madagascar, the VVS had already took illegal actions. It was led by young men... that tried to counter alienation and civil war... that the French were trying to impose in the south. The French finally reached their goals. They chased and imprisoned the young Len. In France, people were very happy with... the abundance of the production... they could freely import from the colonies. The French also perverted and destroyed the Malagasy culture and arts. Still, the people never stopped to protest and demonstrate its will of freedom. They asked for the liberation of the VVS members... the end of the expropriation of the peasants... and consideration for the employees. It led to some strikes and resulted in the creation of the first Malagasy syndicate. The struggle for the Malagasy liberation... led the people to go in the streets. The first time they asked for their freedom was... the 19th of May 1929. Children, you will study writing before you go home. France is our Motherland. Paris is the capital. In France... We grow wheat... Barley... Bye, kids! Hey! Koto! Why are always in a hurry? I have to pick up wood because there is no-one home. Let's go, I'll help you. His husband left long ago. Yes, it's been 5 or 6 months now. Anybody knows if he is still alive? I don't know. I feel sorry for Koto's mother. She's exhausted and her father-in-law is old. But there is only the 3 of them in the house. Does she know that her husband is dead? No one knows if he is hurt or dead. Let's keep working. Stop talking or we won't make it to the market. You're right, we still have so many things to do! - Foreman! - Yes, sir? I just received a letter telling... People from the SMOTIG should have gone home 3 weeks ago! Also, I know you let them think they work for public benefit. But in fact you just have them work your own land! Yes, sir. In this case, I ask you, I order you! To take them here tomorrow to get paid. Yes, sir. - Is that clear? - It's clear, sir. Attention! Present arms! Stand off. I'm asking about the SMOTIG grand-pa, not the war! Everybody listen! The governor told me that when you are done with this land, you can go home. Let's get this done and go home! The soldiers won't hold us anymore. I've been waiting to see my wife for years! This can't go on or our land won't be arable anymore. Thank you so much for helping me. Without you it wouldn't have been done. Don't mention it. Koto's mother may realize that her husband is dead. We should not arouse her sadness. Hurry up, Grand-pa! Mom is waiting for us! Lay down! Stand up, Grand-pa. They are not attacking. Where are you going? Community work is over. We're going home. We can't wait to meet our wives and families again. Aren't yo happy to see your father again? My father is dead already. I'm waiting for my uncle. - Good-bye, Grand-pa! - Bye! We're going home! Mom, Mom! I've heard that the SMOTIG is over. What?! Koto, are you sure? Rakoto, I'm happy that all our men are back. Yes, sir. Yes. The SMOTIGans we got were worthless. Yes, sir, it's true. They are good for nothing. Totally, absolutely. The World War II broke up in September 1939. 72,000 young Malagasy men... are sent to protect the honor of France. I have a telegram here I shall share with you. This is a worrying time. Germany has passed the Rubicon. The war between Germany and France is declared. Colonies are called for helping the motherland. Especially sending men. I think Madagascar is in the best position for this kind of supplying. It has to support to war effort. Koto! Hurry up. I summoned you so that you can take the necessary actions... amongst the indigenous. Dear General Governor, as you know... the natives just went through the SMOTIG. Some of them have been separated from their family for 2 years. It's been a huge sacrifice. Now we should tell them about mobilization. This will, again, take their wives and children's place. I think that, as subjects of France... all of us... including settlers and indigenous, must be mobilized. I repeat once again: France is in danger! - Be welcome, Administrator. - Hello, Mr Soulier. Please, have a sit. Administrator, it's hot. Yes, very hot. Didn't you suffer from your journey? A bit. Mr Soulier, the situation is grave. Germany is at war against France. What? We're at war? You will have to pack your things. You will be mobilized in a few days. - But I just got here! - Don't you discuss. The country is in danger. You have to go. It's an order. You! Get out of my grass! Mr Soulier, I'll leave you. I have more concessions to visit. We will obey your orders. Uncle, didn't you eat rice during the SMOTIG? There is no rice at all over there! But now, we have our land. We can work it and grow a lot of rice. Do you understand? It's different to grow its own land. When you go home in the evening, you join your wife and children. The money will be for us. Not the foreigners. South and North! West and East! Listen to me! Remember that nobody will be allowed to leave this village tomorrow morning! What is he saying? South! North! West! East! Listen to me! Remember that a speech will be done tomorrow! Nobody may go out of this village, young or old! South! North! West! East! Listen to me! Remember that nobody can leave this village tomorrow morning! Small or tall, man or woman, young or old! Important people will hold a speech tomorrow morning! Listen to me! South! North! West! East! Remember that nobody will leave this village tomorrow morning! Small or tall, man or woman, young or old! An important speech will hold tomorrow! There will be more community work. Please God, don't make the SMOTIG start again. Small or tall, man or woman, young or old! Important people will hold a speech tomorrow morning! South! North! West! East! Listen to me! Where are you going, Grand-pa? Where? Listen to me. Let's send the child to the city to study. We still have some money left to pay for his studies. He is too young to go through all this. His just a child. They will call him for sure. He can't avoid the community work. There is no way you can save him. Mom! Grand-pa is still not arrived. Go look for him. Grand-pa! Grand-pa! Grand-pa! Grand-pa! Grand-pa! Grand-pa! Grand-pa! Present arms! Ladies, gentlemen... I have a very good news for you. The allies are almost in Paris. The was will be over soon. Administrator. Administrator, we'll be able to work. Our plantations need it. We all hope so. Listen to this... Numbers! Only numbers! Most of it, in a newspaper! It's been approved at the top. 55 millions for armament. 37 millions for the resistance. And 8 millions for the children of France. Congratulations, it's wonderful. Madam, I have to thank you for all you've done. Thanks to your collects in Indian... We have been able to save our children, our motherland: France and the French. The war is over. Hitler and his allies are defeated in Italy and Japan. The World War II has been devastating. Millions of lives have been sacrificed. From Madagascar and other colonies... and 20 millions of Soviets. The end of the war has been celebrated all over the world. The most important countries met in San Francisco. They recognized the right of the colonies to govern themselves. A wind of freedom blows. Madagascar, as much as the other colonies, have great hopes of freedom. But no matter how hard Madagascar helped France... during the World War II. Of which: sending troops... setting up the Rice Office, going back to community work... Its liberty was still tread on. Violence was still awaiting the colonies asking for freedom. You! Get lost! Our state needs money! You are the only who did not gave some. My husband hasn't earned money yet. Look, he's ill. We lack money. Liars! I know your husband is working! In this case, we will seize his whole salary. So, Mialy. How are you doing? We're doing fine. I wanted to ask if you'd have some rice for us. There is no rice here. We all lack rice. The strangers took everything and left nothing for us. Please, save me. My child has not been eating. He can't stay without eating. Please share what you can to save my child. Dear Mialy, all I can give you is two small cups. Finally my child will eat. I'll give what I can. Give me your bag. A lot of medals of all kinds were given to the people. But the Malagasy people had elected senators to speak to the French. So they asked again for the freedom of Madagascar. They founded the MDRM that quickly spread through the island. But France was always asking for more. They set-up a scheme to eradicate the MDRM. Arrests, imprisonments, malpractice, corruption... The wrath of the people flamed up. In this case... This should be easy to decide. We all agreed already. You all know that... Our deputies will meet the General Governor. They will tell him our demands and ambitions. Consequently, each of us... each of us! Must be able to explain and detail the letter we sent him earlier. Because too much Malagasy blood has been spilled during the War! Because our mothers, our fathers and our children have been crying! Because they had to go... but never came back: our father, our children, our brothers! Because we are tired of their false promises. Because all they do is talking! Freedom, Equality, Fraternity... So many things that are only words thrown in the air. Because our freedom is too precious. The independence won't come back on its own. Thus, we must fight: If we have to die, let's all die fighting. For all these things, we will make a pledge. Our ancestor's land is sacred! Our ancestor's land is sacred! Thank you. Guys... This time, this is serious. Maybe we should go to Tana. Listen, Captain. We are here. Let them come. Let's go home, dear. - Good night, Madam. - Good night. Here is the barrack we will assault. The soldiers live in the other building. The two of you will take care of the soldiers. The arms are in this room. Your group will have to get in it. Be careful, there may be guards outside. I will lead the third group. We will attack the hotel where the officers sleep. Remember! Our main goal is to come at the arms. Understood? Get out! There are robbers! What? Rakoto... Tell me what you heard. I heard that... People are going to demonstrate. They can come, we're ready. Here they are. Open fire! Open fire! Your testimony is not signed yet? I won't sign something false, sir. My friend has been is France. Help! Help! You don't want to sign? We will see... Enough! I need him alive. This is not a life we have. It's no unfair! We did nothing at all. They didn't even gave us a reason. They keep us locked in this room but don't tell us when we'll be freed. This is not a life, they are ruining it. They think we are worth less than animals. - Even their dogs have houses. - Get away. We have no human life anymore. We're worth less than animals. They keep belittling us. Say, station master.. Do you know how long they will keep up? We've been kidnapped and locked up in this stable for 4 days now. - When will we go home? - Listen to me, everyone. A wagon has just arrived. It's full of people. Let's see what it's about. I'm a doctor. I was working when they arrived. They were two and I followed them. I saw them come here. Tell me, young man. How did you end up here? You have nothing serious. Wait, I have something to check. Don't discuss and come with us! I am... a teacher. I was teaching my children... when they came to our school. Independence of Greece. Silence! Don't you know what it means? It means shut up! 1830-47 Conquest of Algeria. Silence. Protectorate of Tonkin. You come with us! What have I done? What is this? You can do this? Hey, you. Soldier, please, give us food. We're hungry. We're starving. Give us water. Water. Please, please sir! Open fire! Attention! Our Father, Who art in heaven Hallowed be Thy Name; Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Is this how you want to fight? Here are the bastards. The dirty bastards. This is what you bastards deserve. Help! Help! Help me! Excuse me. Could you bring this meal to my husband, please? Also I'd like to see him. Sorry Madam, I can't. You should thank the Lord for not being arrested. What I can do if you really need something is... come to your house tonight. - OK, good. Bye. - Good bye. What is your husband up to? Revolt! He's a shame for our family. Let's go home. You can come if you want. May your father convince him. It's incredible. Mom, my husband has to revolt. What is the point? This is not what your family needs. Revolt, revolt... It won't bring happiness nor wealth. Do you understand? I don't understand what you mean, Mom. Why do you say that? I'm telling you, revolt won't bring anything good! You have to realize it! If you don't eat your child won't have milk anymore. Have some rice. Forget everything and eat. Just eat it! Who's that, Mom? Don't open. Maybe they are coming to arrest you. Who is it? It's you, Maurice. Come in. Don't mind, we're all Malagasy. - No problem? - No problem at all. What can I do for you? Well... I want to to ask... if you could bring food and cigarettes to my husband. I'm sorry but I can't. It's too risky. Too bad. But I could do something else. I'll guard him tomorrow. There will be a lot of us. I just need 40 Ariary. 40? Where can I find such an amount? If you can't... I'm sorry but I'll have to go. 40? I have to find 40 Ar. Prisoners, you have to work hard! You, you and you! Put the corpse in the cart. Come on, hurry up! - What is this? - Help! In 1947... 90,000 Malagasy were killed by war and terrorism... amongst a population of 1.4 million. For 10 years, French took total control of several cities. 20,000 Malagasy were interrogated. 5,000 were put in jail. The court martial sentenced some of them to be shot to death. The MDRM and its leaders were tried. 6 of them were sentenced to death. The others were sentenced to exile until death. In some regions... Malagasy had to surrender to the French. Some French democrats and politicians stood against that. They organized protests in Paris. The Malagasy organize mutual help... to help the families of imprisoned persons... and collect signatures for a general amnesty. Because loving our country can't be a crime. After several revolts... The prisoners were released one after the other. Political parties could be created again. 10 political parties assemble in Tamatave. They agreed they would ask for independence together. The congress made an agreement with Algeria... and with Vietnam. Madagascar is independent again. But the cooperation with the French is predominant. The Malagasy people don't want neocolonialism. Through parties, elections, newspapers... and protest, the regime was dethroned in 1972. General Ramanantsoa and Colonel Ratsimandrava took power. I don't fear ruling, General. Because we need someone to take responsibilities. Our country went through difficult times. I accept all the responsibilities you give me today. And I thank you... for the help and the guidance... you will give me and my government. But... Tuesday the 11th of February 1975, around 08:00 pm... After the colonel hold a council of ministers... On his way back home to Anjohy... he was shot by an enemy of the state... at Ambohijatovo. "After leading the council of ministers in Anosy... in the evening of Tuesday, the 11th of February... on his way home... There was a group... who shot at him at Ambohijatovo. A military directory was established... to guide and rule to country. It was lead by Didier Ratsiraka. A convention for a social revolution was adopted by the people. It was the red book. A new constitution was made and Dider Ratsiraka was the president. 30th of December 1975 The Democratic Republic of Madagascar was founded. We decided to protect and preserve our independence. Liberty. Virtue. Justice and Peace. No matter what happen. Translation and timing: tadanobu Transcription: Rado
