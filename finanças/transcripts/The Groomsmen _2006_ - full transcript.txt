You're not comin', TC? - There's a fine line between fishing and standing in the boat looking like an idiot, all right? - Come on, don't leave me hangin', man, I feel like shit. - Jimmy, he just wants to spend time with you. It's the least you could do as his brother. Just be nice to him, okay? And remember, don't say anything about Sue, you promised. - Come on, baby, have a little faith in me, all right? - You know, I purposely didn't go fishin', 'cause I know you need to talk. - So talk, what's goin' on? - Come on, you've got some sense of what's going on. - I'm tellin' you, he's got this edge, this ridiculous edge. I mean, how long's he been in this funk? - It's been this way - about a year. - A year? - I mean, did he tell you he got fired again last week? What do you mean, again? - Second job in ten months. You knew him years ago, is he the type of guy that gets fired? - All right, look, have you tried just being direct and saying, "Jimbo, what the fuck is goin' on?" - Come on, I've tried everything. I've tried couples counseling, I've tired his father. Nothing, he won't talk to anyone. And he's getting fat too. Yeah, that I noticed. - I mean, he thinks it's funny that he's let himself go. He says now that he's married, why bother. - Well, you know, that's what happens when you get to 35. You think you got your head together, and then all the sudden your body falls apart. - Yeah, well his head is hardly together. I gotta hand it to you, bro. You figured it out, man, you know. You got a nice house, great boat. all the time to enjoy it. - Hey, look, I only fish before or after work, all right. Today's an exception, because I wanted to spend time with my big brother. Wait a minute, you call what you do work? Shit, if I had to type for a couple of hours every day, yeah, I'd have plenty of energy to fish. - Wait, you're gonna try and tell me that the reason you just go home and watch TV every night is because you're too tired from sellin' office supplies? - I'm not a salesman, I'm the general manager. Okay, there's big difference. I've got 15 people underneath me. - Yeah, Jimbo. I've seen that pack of misfits that work under you. - Jesus Christ, come on, Paulie, seriously. Do not try and compare what you do for a living with what I do for a living, 'cause there's no comparison. I do a man's work, okay. I have to oversee multiple locations. I've got shipping, inventory, I've got trucks. So when I come home, I'm tired, all right? I'm not doin' what you do, what do you do? You sit in front of the computer for a half an hour? An hour? So you have the free time to jog and to lift weights and to fish and do all that fun shit that you seem to have all day to do. - All right, I see what you're sayin'. So, you think the reason that you've packed on a couple of pounds lately is because you don't have the time to work out anymore. - What other reason would there be? - I don't know. Maybe it's the 12 pack of Budweiser a night, I don't know. - Jesus Christ, l work a long day. I don't have time to exercise, but I enjoy a few cocktails, okay? If you knew what I went through, the pressures I was under, the deadlines, you wouldn't begrudge me a fuckin' drink. All right, I didn't get lucky, man, okay. I did not marry a rich girl. Fuckin', I'll hand it to you, you got lucky. You know, I didn't want to get into it with you, you know what I'm sayin', Paulie? I just, I'm worried about you, that's all. - What the hell are you worried about? - You're gettin' married. - Jimbo, we've been living together for a couple of years. You know, I think it's gonna be all right. - It's different when you get married, trust me. You know, I just don't wanna see you makin' a mistake. - We got a baby comin' in a couple of months, all right. It's a little too late to worry about that, all right? - Hey look, I know, I know. You don't have to get married to someone just 'cause you got them pregnant. I mean, it's not the '50s. No one's puttin' a gun to your head. - I'm marrying her, because I love her. Is that so hard to believe? - No, of course, l know you love her. And you're a good guy, I mean, you're the kind of guy who's always done the right thing. It's just, it's not necessarily the right thing to get married to someone just 'cause you got them pregnant, that's all. I just don't wanna see you makin' some huge mistake. - Hey, Dez. Rehearsal, one hour, in my garage. - That is the commitment I like to see, cuz. What are you talking about? It's Nirvana all the way, dude. - Yo. Do you see me unloading the minivan? - Aw, come on, dad, we're going to Murph's. We're gonna be late. - You're gonna be more late if you don't get your butt off the bike and help me unload the minivan. - We have to be there in five minutes, dad. You gotta be there in five minutes? Well, let me ask you a real quick question. Who likes the delicious Fruit Loops? You do? That's good. How about the little fudgie-fudgies? You like these? I guess if you're too busy to help your dad unload the minivan, you're too busy to eat crap food. Okay, okay, we'll help you. - You're gonna help, what a good idea. Hey, there's more out there. - Whoa, where's the fire? So the band is back together? - Yeah, they're totally into it, we're rehearsin' later on. - I can't believe they actually agreed to it. - Why wouldn't they agree to it? Why wouldn't they want to rock? - Because, sweetie, maybe the band didn't mean as much to them as it did to you. - What are you drivin' at? All I'm sayin' is, those were your glory days, were they not? - They were not my glory days. I've had plenty of good days since then. That was like what, 17 years ago.

'Cause he's your brother. - Not a good enough reason. - Is there any way you're blowing this thing out of proportion? I remember how nervous l was before I got married. I was 21 years old, right?

Jimbo, what was that song you wrote for Jules when you were trying to woo her in High School. What was it? Woo me, is that what you call it? He had ulterior motives if I remember correctly. - Remember that song you wrote for her. Back when you were trying to, you know what I mean. Back in the day, remember? - What are you talkin', like 20 years ago? - Come on, come on, don't be a prick. Come on, you used to play all the time. Come on, what was it, it was, how did it go? ♪ Hey Jules ♪ Don't you play me for no fool ♪ - Jesus Christ, that was back in High School, man. How am I supposed to remember that? - Jimmy, you're so full of shit. You didn't forget the song. I don't remember the song. But you remember every note to Stairway to Heaven. But you can't remember three cords you wrote for me. - I haven't played Stairway to Heaven for years, Jesus, come on. But that's not the fuckin' point. - Hey, why don't you just grab the guitar and play it for her, come on. - Look, I don't remember the fuckin' song. If I remembered the song, I would play the song, okay? But I don't remember, I'm sorry. - I'm havin' a tough time, Paulie, I don't know what's goin' on. You know what it is? I get over come with emotions, you know? Like, I'm completely flooded with emotion. I start crying, my heart gets all heavy, I can't drive. 'Cause every song I hear on the radio reminds me of her, right. And then, I know I shouldn't go over there and see her, but I can't help myself, I gotta see her with my own eyes. - Seriously, you just, you gotta calm down, man. I mean, there are other women out there. Just give yourself time, and you'll meet somebody new. - But not that hot, Paulie, she's so hot. And that ass, God, Paulie. When am I gonna find someone that hot that likes me back again. That's a combo in this life time. - Look, you know, when I met Sue, she was kinda going through what you're going through now. She was datin' this clown from Staten Island. When I was workin' over there, I'd see her on the ferry occasionally. And one night, I'm comin' back. And I see her, and she's crying. You know, so, I go over to her. You know, and being the nice cordial guy that I am. I ask how she's doin', and she tells me the story about how she just found out that her boyfriend was cheatin' on her. So I walked her home and asked her, you know, maybe when she's feeling better, maybe she let's me take her out. Maybe, you know, maybe let me make somethin' in her life. A month later, she called. Here we are, a baby on the way. - I didn't know that's how you guys met, on the ferry like that. That's romantic, Paulie. - Yeah, yeah. - Like, that's really romantic. How come you never told me that before? I don't know, man, you know. Just, that kinda shit just doesn't come up, does it? What about Violet, I like that. That could be a good name. - No, no flowers. And no virtuous names either, like Hope, Faith or Chastity. She should have a regular name like Liz or Betty. - Liz or Betty? Now, you are aware that those are the same name, right? They're both nicknames for Elizabeth. You know what, l didn't know that. No, you know what we should do? We should just do what, like Dez and Tina did. They waited until their boys were born. Check out their personalities, and then they name them. So, are you waiting to check out her personality before you finish painting her room? - I'm gonna get to the room, all right? How 'bout Betty? Ya like Betty? - I like it, Elizabeth it is then. I like Elizabeth. - Okay. - Okay. ♪ I can't stand to see you sad ♪ I can't bear to hear you cry - Where do you think you're goin'? - I got an eight o'clock tee time with Paulie and the guys I'm runnin' late for. - You're not doin' anything, I'm goin' to work and it's your turn to take the kids to school. - I have an eight o'clock tee time.

If anybody was gonna get it, it'd be you. - Bro, I have no idea what you're talkin' about. - Well, the reason l left the way I did was because, well, you know, I accepted something about myself that I knew you guys couldn't. - I mean, we were your best friends, man. What wouldn't we accept about ya? - Paulie, I'm gay. - Hey, you know... If I'm honest with myself, I probably, it probably crossed my mind a couple of times, but just... You never allowed yourself to really believe it, right? - Yeah, yeah, I guess. - Yeah, well, welcome to the first 25 years of my life, man. - So, what, that's just what you do now or... No, dude, dude, that's who I am now. Yeah, yeah, that's what I meant. - Just hit the ball, come on. Made you nervous, didn't l? Little bit, little bit. I'm tellin' you, my dad flipped when I told him. I'm sure, what did he say? - Well, you can imagine, right? I mean, my dad's like old school, like, it was the hardest thing I ever had to do, man. You know, I just really prepared my announcement to him. And then one night at dinner. I just says to him, "Dad, could you pass the salt to a homosexual?" And my Dad just stayed real quiet for a long time. And then he says to me, "Are you seeing a psychiatrist?" Like I got some kind of sickness or something. And then he says to me, with real disgust, "Be safe." Yeah, and that was it, man, that was it. That was it. - Hey, Dez. Can we talk for a second about what a stupid idea it is to have a softball game for a bachelor party? I mean, come on. What the hell is that all about? You know what we should be doin'? Yeah, playin' basketball. - No, man, we should be gettin' a limo and we should be packin' it full of strippers and we should all be gettin', you know, on our way down to Atlantic City. - Yeah, our wives would love that. Look, he wants to play softball, we're playin' softball. My God, softball, that's a lot of fun. - You all right? He said, he says you were judgmental yesterday. - Who did, he did? Paulie said I was being judgmental? Yeah. - He said that to you? When? - The other day. - He said I was being judgmental the other day? - To you? - Yeah. - He didn't say shit to me, look, I was just, what, the other day, we talked. I was just telling him what my feelings were, you know what I mean? I mean, he's my brother. I can't give him advice? - Don't give him advice unless he asks for it. - No, that's what an older brother's supposed to do. You know Paulie, he's not gonna ask for advice. - Just do everyone a favor, all right. Just for the next couple days, keep your opinions about Sue to yourself. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's that mean? Did he say I said somethin' about Sue? Jesus Christ, look, I'm just lookin' out for him, man. I mean, seriously, do you think he's doing this thing because he loves this girl? Or do you think he's doing it because he knocked her up? - No, I think he's doing it for all the right reasons. He loves her. - I still don't understand why you would let his asinine comments bother you. Sue, how could they not bother me? - Well, because they would only bother you if they were true. - Look, he's my brother and my best man. He's supposed to be supportive, all right. Just think about what his speech is gonna be like. To Paulie and Sue, I think you're makin' a huge mistake. But good luck, you're gonna need it. - What do you think, Paulie? You think we're making a mistake? What, what are you talking about? No. - Well, are you excited to get married? - Sue, of course I'm excited to get married. I mean, look, all I'm saying is maybe Jimbo shouldn't be the best man, if he feels the way he does. I mean, think about it, it just doesn't feel right. - How do you feel, Paulie? - I mean, would you still have proposed to me if I weren't pregnant? Of course, but, look. It's an unfair question, because you are pregnant. And, you know, I'm not going to put myself into a hypothetical. - If you're doing this out of some kind of obligation, Paulie, then you can forget about it. I want to get married to you. 'Cause I love you. But if you don't feel the same way about me, then you can just forget about it. - Forget about it. - Sue, Sue. Of course I feel the same way. You know, you're being irrational. Yes, I love you, but can I say that positively, you know, I'm ready to get married and have kids? I don't know. - Excuse me? Then what are we doing here, Paulie? What? - Look, look, this is real life, okay. You know, these are the cards we were dealt. - The cards we were dealt? This is not a God damn hand of poker that's poppin' out of my belly, Paulie. - Sue, this is crazy, we're getting married in three days. I just told you what my brother said 'cause it pissed me off. Jesus. You know, l was thinkin'. You should get into upper management. - I was in upper management. - No, no, I'm not talkin' about work, I'm talkin' about your family, your new wife. You guys should start a family. It'd settle you down, man. Get rid of all that noise in your head. - Where's this comin' from? - It's just, you know, you have a kid, you walk in the light. You, I don't know, it gives you a reason to wake up in the morning. Walk in the light? Yeah. What, it's too much? - Hold on. - Too heavy? - Yo. What the fuck? - What? Where are you? - What, I'm gettin' lunch with Dez, why? - You asked me if you could work a couple days this week. Don't you remember askin' me if you could work today? Did we say today? - Yeah, we said today. I fuckin' forgot, I was gettin' tuxedo's with Dez. - Yeah, I got mine this morning, nice. Cummerbund, forget about it, it's all over. Damn, I got busy, man, we can't do this tomorrow? - No, we can't do it tomorrow. Tomorrow's Paulie's softball game. You know, Jimbo, you're really kind of screwin' me here. I'm short a man, I got a job to do. - Fuck, come on, Mike, God damn it. I'm goin' through some shit in my life, real shit right now. And you're givin' me a hard time about edging some fuckin' lawn? I'll talk to you later. You're wrong. Wally Schirra never walked on the moon. - So, my little guy's jumping up and down on the bed, right. And he says to me, he says, "Hey, pull my finger," right. So I pull his finger, but instead of farting, the little guy, he's in shorts, and he shits himself. He's jumping up and down on his bed. - Poor kid. - And the little guy - He followed through. - shits himself right then and there. What did you do? - I said, "Son, you're an idiot, clean your shit up." That's really understanding of you, man. - No, no, listen, you gotta learn. If you shit yourself, you gotta pick it up. - I don't like that story at all, it's kind of sad. - You know what, cousin Mike, you gotta tell the story about the time you pissed in your pants. - Which time was that? - Which time was that, what was it? In Sisters Dorothy's class, you were, I think, in 11th grade. - Sister Dorothy's class was 4th grade. But you know what, let Jimbo tell it. 'Cause he was in the class, he sat right behind me. No, it was 6th grade. - 6th grade, what difference, I pissed my pants. Who cares what grade it was? Jimbo. - Yeah, okay, so we're in Sister Dorothy's class and Mikey's sittin' two seats up in front of me, right. He says, he raises his hand, "Can I go to the bathroom?" And she says, "No." All right, so 10 minutes pass and he raises his hand again, and he says, "Can I go to the bathroom?" And she says, "No," again. - And she knows I'm suffering, 'cause she can see the pain in my eyes. And you know what, she doesn't care, because she's a nun. And she likes to see kids suffer. - Yeah, and this was a big day. We had, like, these special reports due, this book report. And he had just, you had done this thing on, you had drawn this picture of Tom Seaver. Remember, you spent days doing it? This really passionate, intense... It was awesome. It had to be passionate. 'Cause it was about the '69 Mets, right. Tom Seaver, your favorite. So I drew the picture of Tom Terrific on the mound. Wham with that fast ball, inside out cuttin' action. Go ahead. - So, some other kid's readin' this report. And I hear whimperin'. And I look up, and it's Mikey and he's shakin'. Okay, and I'm wonderin' what the hell's is goin' on. And I look down and I notice there's a big, there's a pool of piss in his seat. And it's drippin' down, right on top of Tom Seaver. Right on top of his report, this poor kid. And then the other kids are noticing, and he starts to cry. Okay. And then Sister Dorothy notices, and you know what she says? - She says, "Stop being such a baby." - That's fucked up. - Yeah, but what does my big brother do? I mean, the protector of all of us. - Jimbo, check this out, comes over to my desk, grabs me by my hand, and he says, "Come on, we're leavin'." And he just walks me through the class. And he walks me right up to the door. And Sister Dorothy goes, "Where do you two think you're going?" - How the fuck have l never heard this story? - You've heard this story before. - I have never heard this story, before. - You know, you were probably too busy worrying about how to get the band together or something like that You guys don't wanna rock? - I do wanna rock. I just don't want you to keep asking me what fuckin' dot we're on, you know what I'm sayin'? - You're a bunch of dicks. I don't know why I call you friends. Come on, guys, let Jimbo finish the story. Finish the story. - And I said, "Get out of our way." - No, that's not what he said, That's not what he said. Jimbo looks at Sister Dorothy and says, I quote, "Get the fuck out of our way." - All right, but here's the best part. - What's better than that? - So, here's the best part. She does. She clears outta the way. They walk right outta the front door of the school and go. That's the kind of big brother I got. To big Jim. My best man. - I'll toast to that. Jimbo. - Jimbo, that was beautiful, man. To Jimbo, come on, bro. What about me, I'm the one that pissed my pants. - Hey, Paulie, would you be pissed at me if I didn't come to your wedding? 'Cause I'm startin' to feel kinda weird about it. - Look, I know you're drunk, so I'm not going to pay too much attention to this, but what the hell are you feelin' weird about? - I don't even have a girlfriend. I don't have a girlfriend, I live in the same house I grew up in, l got the same job I had since High School. That'd be great if I was 23 years old, but I'm not 23 years old. I'm 33 years old. When am I gonna have a family, he's got a family. He's got two beautiful boys, you're starting a family. When's my family, what, when I'm an old man? - What's that gotta do with you not going to his wedding? - A lot. I don't want everyone asking me about Jen and be answering questions about Jen all night. - Who's gonna be asking? Who? - Listen to me, Michael, you're my cousin, right? You're coming to my wedding. - All right, Paulie, okay. Go to bed. - All right, all right. Get some sleep. Get out. - I'm gonna call her. No, no, you're not gonna call anybody, all right? You're gonna go to bed. We got softball first thing in the morning. - You're right, you're right. Hey, see you tomorrow. - Hey, why don't you wake up the whole neighborhood? Smarten up. - Enough already, my kids are sleeping. - I'm sorry, Dez. Hey, Pop, let's go fish. Isn't gettin' married so much fun? Yeah, yeah, a lot of fun. A lot of fun. - Paulie, every time a guy gets married, he gets divorced from his friends. And his buddies are never going to be 100% supportive of that. - This has been a weird week, you know, I mean, like Jimbo all of a sudden seemed like his old-self tonight. - Right? - Yeah. - I'm thinkin' I should just keep him as the best man. But then I got cousin Mike telling me he doesn't wanna go to the fuckin' wedding. I mean, what the hell is that about? - It's training you for kids. It's God's way of training you for kids. I mean, every day you wake up, they can completely have a different personality. Trust me. Man, I gotta tell you, Dez, I'm freakin' out about that man. I mean, how do you the whole kids thing? - I mean, honestly? If you have one kid, right, you loose a little bit of your life, a little free time, a Iittle bit of your freedom. You have two kids, your life is over, Jojo. - So why do it, I mean... Why did you and Tina have another kid? - What do you do with your free time? Honestly, what do you do? You watch TV. You go and hang out with these knuckle heads. You jerk off, right. Listen to me, free time, it's not all it's cracked up to be. But at the end of the night, if I couldn't, you know... If I couldn't go upstairs and check in on my little boys, you know, if I couldn't look at 'em and make sure they're okay, you know, my life, my life would be empty, is what it would be. Look, there are people that know, and there are people that don't know. And you, my man, are about to be a man that knows. All right? - All right, thank you. No fear. You sleep tight. - Hey, psst, Paulie. You know, I'm doin' this whole band thing for you. So, you know, if you don't wanna do it, just let me know, all right? - Dez, I'm into it, all right. - Nice. That's good, hey, if you could just get the other guys a little excited about it, that would great. Because it's important. I mean, it's really important that we do this. All right? Hey, hey, Paulie. And just remember, when we rock out, shirts are optional, baby. - Go to bed, Desmond. - These guys have uniforms, we're gonna get crushed. - All right, let's go, bring it in here. Come on now, take a knee. - Get your hat off, Jimbo, let's go, hats off. - I'm good, I'm good. Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread. Forgive us for our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. Amen. - All right, bring it in here real quick, we do buttered tongue on three. One, two, three. Buttered tongue. - It's goin' right out there. - All right, Jimbo, get ready to move. - Come on, Paulie, do your thing. - Come on, Paulie. Paulie. Paulie, let's go, Paulie. Coney lsland? What do you say to that, hotdog? - Come on, big mouth. Come on, big mouth. Nice rip, cuz. Good to see you've been the cages. - Nice one, Mike, way to go. I got it, I got it. You're out, I got it. What the fuck is your fuckin' problem? - What the fuck are you talkin' about? It was my ball, you shouldn't have even tried to fuckin' get it. - They why didn't you get it? - Because you fuckin' called for it. I didn't wanna get barreled over by you, - Fuck you. Listen, next time I call for it, clear the fuck out. I'm the center fielder. - Hey, you know what, Jimbo, fuck you, man. - No, fuck you, man. - Go fuck yourself. - Fuck you. You've been a fuckin' prick every... Fuck you, asshole. All right, all right, hey, break it up. Hey, get off, get off, get off. Hey, hey, hey, knock it off. You mother fucker, Paulie! Come on, relax. I'll fuck you up. Hey, hey, hey. Knock it off, knock it off. - Come on, bitch. - Fuck you. Hey. Paulie, come on, seriously. - You know what? I'm fuckin' done, all right. I'm goin' home. - Good, you big pussy, go home. Boohoo. - Hey, and you know, another thing Jimbo, how about this, you're not gonna be my best man. How about that, you fuckin' prick. Bullshit, what, because of this? - Yeah, because of this. - It's a fuckin' softball game, I'm your fuckin' brother. - Yeah, well, then why don't you fuckin' start acting like one, ya fat fuck. - Fuck you. Fuck you, buddy. I don't want to part of your wedding anyway. Fuck your fucking wedding. Don't say anything you're gonna regret man. - Man, fuck you. And I'm the fuckin' center fielder, bitch. Can I talk to you about something? Jesus Christ, baby. It's not a good time, trust me. - Just hear me out, 'cause I really need to talk to you. - Why does everyone need to fuckin' talk to me right now? Are you crying? - Like you give a shit. - Of course I give a shit, baby, But my brother just fuckin' wigged out on me. Just keep it together, all right. You're a selfish fucking asshole, you know that? - What do you wanna do? - Just go to hell. - What do you want? - You wanna talk? - Yeah, I wanna talk. All right, then let's talk. - Right now. - Then talk. Talk to me. - Just, fuck you, I can't stand your face. - Bullshit, I'm listening, talk to me, right now. I'm fuckin' waiting, I'm right here. I'm gonna take a shower. My fucking brother. Fuck. Hello? - Hey Julianna, it's Paulie. Look, is Jimbo around? No, he just left. - If you speak to him later, could you have him call me? We just had a stupid situation at the softball game. And I just don't like the way I left things. - Fine Paulie, if I hear from him, I'll tell him. - Hey, is everything all right? You sound a little upset. - No, everything's fine. I'll pass on the message, okay. - Boys, where you at? We're in here, dad. Hey, grab your axes, let's practice. - Dad, we practiced all ready. - Yo, gentlemen, when I ask you to do something, I expect you to do it. Let's go, chop-chop. Come on. That's filthy. - What you are talkin' about? - Dude, it's awesome. - Blues is awesome. - All right, what were we working on last week? - Dad, you know our band is so lame. - What is it? It's Loverboy. Something like that. - Loverboy, '85, the best of, let's go, rock out. No, that was the worst of. - Rock out. - Fine. If you don't, I'm gonna slap a headband on you. Go. - No. - Grab your bass. - Just play. That's it, listen to each other. - Exactly. - Ready? ♪ I was born to run, I was born to dream ♪ The craziest boy you ever seen ♪ I gotta do it my way ♪ Or no way at all ♪ And I was here to please, I'm even on my knees ♪ Makin' love to whoever I please ♪ I gotta do it my way ♪ Or no way at all Mike, don't you even wanna know why I didn't call you all these years? I really don't give a shit at this point, TC. - Come on, come on, don't you think it would have to be something really heavy for me to just take off not tell you about it, come on. We shared everything, man, when my mom died, who did I go to first? I went to you. We shared everything. - Yeah, so I thought. I also thought we were gonna go in together on my dad's landscaping business. Not me, we. - Both of us. - I know, I know. - No one knows how to get hold of you. Your father doesn't even know where to reach you. And then, what, I'm left holding the bag - on the landscaping business. - I know, I know I didn't - handle it right, okay. - Handle it? You didn't handle anything, what the fuck did you handle? - Mike, I'm gay. - What? - The reason I left was 'cause I'm a homosexual. - You didn't talk to me for eight years, 'cause you're a gay? That doesn't even make fuckin' sense. - It does make sense, 'cause when I told my dad about it, he couldn't deal with it, so what's gonna make me think that my friends could handle it any better? - Because we were your friends, And I was your best friend, man. Jesus Christ, what did you think? I wasn't gonna talk to you again for the rest of our lives? That's what wound up happening anyway. Why didn't you gamble on me, man? - 'Cause I just didn't think you'd understand. - So you take my Tom Seaver fuckin' rookie card? That was my favorite card in the world. - That's the one you take? - No, no, no, no. Do you wanna know why I stole your Tom Seaver card? - Yeah. - You wanna know why - l stole your Tom Seaver card. - I just said l wanna know, what are we arguing about? - 'Cause I was pissed at you man, that's why. Can you imagine being gay, and having your best friend making faggot jokes 24/7, every God damn day of your life? Don't be such a fudge-packer this. Take it up the ass that. Can you imagine being me, man? Be me for a God damn day. So I took the one thing l knew would piss you off. You son of a bitch. Dad. Dad. Fuck you. - Yo. What up, B, what are you doin' around here? Just gonna go see your Dad? - Nah, hell no. I was just walkin' around, clearing my thoughts, you know. What about you, get over your little tantrum? - I will after the drink I'm about to have. - What is with you, you're getting a drink, you don't invite me, what, l go away for eight years and all of a sudden I'm an outcast? - Shut the fuck up, get in. - That's right. Come on, son. Get off my car. How many times do I gotta tell you? Go join the Army like your brother. I got five messages from you, what do you want? Hey, what's up, twins. - Come on, get outta here, and get off the grass. - Listen. - Get me a crunch. - I know why TC took my Tom Seaver rookie card, he told me. There's your crunch. He took my Tom Seaver rookie card because he's gay. And he was mad at me, because I kept making gay jokes all through high school. He's a gay guy, our best friend's a gay guy. And we were all making gay jokes, I felt terrible. But you made gay jokes too, right? - No, because I knew, l knew before he did, I knew back in high school. - How did you know he was a gay? He was doin' somethin' down the shore and, I don't know, it's just, you know, I knew. - How would you know, are you a gay? - No. Only on the weekends, but don't tell my wife. Pay for my crunch. - Let me get a screwball. Come on, today. You know, you're parked in front of my house. This one's on the arm. Now this, this is where we should have a bachelor party at. What is this? Man, come on. You're a married guy, what are you doin' here? You're not. Yeah, I don't like these joints, man. - Why, man, it's fucking great. Let me tell ya somethin', buddy. For the next hour, I'm not married, you know what I'm sayin'? Gentlemen put your hands together for the Baroness of Burlesque, Crystal. And here he is, one of our regular , Monsieur Jimbo. - Hi, Jimbo. - Hey, Kiff. Two whiskey's up here. Hey, Crystal, I didn't know you worked Fridays. Yeah, all right. Charming place. - Looks all right to me. Hey, Mr. B. - Hey Jimbo, what do you say? Who's your friend? - This is my friend TC, he's been my friend since we were 3 years old. Now he gives me a hard time, just like you do. What are you giving Jimbo a hard time about? - I'm actually not, I'm just trying to make sure he's okay. That's all Yeah, I'm fine. - I can tell you, he is not okay. Look at him. It's the middle of the afternoon, he's a married man and he's in a titty bar. If that's doin' okay, this world's upside down. Don't you start in on me, all right. - Wanna hear what I tell this bum every time I see him? He's lucky. He's lucky, he don't know real hardship. He's like all the kids your age. Big fuckin' babies, cryin' all the time. Cryin' all the time instead of knowin' you's are lucky. Let me ask you a question. - TC? - Yeah. - Are you married? - Jesus Christ. - No, I'm not. You know, I've heard this speech before. Excuse me, I'm going to be at the bar. No, no, no, sit down. That's all right, I'm going... Where are you gonna go? Stay here two seconds. Learn something for a change. Are you married? - No, sir, no, I'm not. - Any kids? - No. - You ever been in the service? - Nope. - See, now, that figures, Because if you had gone into the service, they would teach you how to be a man. Really? - Instead, you stay home with your mother, Iivin' in the same house you were born in for 25 years. And what happens? She teaches you how to be a cheerleader. Definition of an adult is a person that has a job, is married, has kids and owns a home. Okay? When I was growin' up, the average age of an adult, by that definition, was 24 years old. Now, how old are you? - I'm 35, sir. - Christ had already died on the cross for your sins by that age. Why don't you have a wife and kids? - 'Cause I'm gay, sir, that's why. Hey, Jimbo, come on, what are you doin'? I think we should get out of here, come on. - I'm just having a drink with my friend Crystal. - I think we should go, come on, let's go. - Dude, if you wanna go, go. I just got here, man. - Come on, I wanna talk to you over here. - If you wanna fuckin' go, TC, just fuckin' go. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, is everything all right here? - Yeah. - It's fine. - Everything's okay? - Yeah, he's a friend of mine. - Excuse me, ma'am, can I talk to him - for a minute, please? - TC, stop. - Fuck. - Come on. Think of Julianna, come on. - God damn it, don't you fuckin' dare bring that shit up. - Exactly, think about it. This is not going to fix it. - TC, you are so fuckin' close to gettin' slapped. Just get the fuck outta my face. - Come on, I'm wanna ask you one last time. Please come with me right now. Okay, I tried man, I tried. - Shut the fuck up. I hear thunder. Look at the old man, he's an animal. Who's an animal? - Look if you want her, don't be a wuss, go and get her. - I'm not a wuss, Pop, come on. Just, she don't wanna be bothered, that's all. - Suit yourself. - All right, come on, Pops, let's go. Go get 'em, old man. Use the jab, Pop, use the jab. Jenny. Hey, Jen. Jennifer, come on out. Jenny, hey. - Mike, why are you here? - 'Cause I love you, Jen, all right. l love you so much, I can't get ya outta my life. - I need you. - Okay, okay, okay. You're scaring me. I don't know any other way to say this, but I never want to see you again. - Why am I scarin' you Jen, I just wanna get you back in my life, that's all. - Okay, we're never getting back together again, okay. It's over. I never wanna see you again. I don't wanna be friends, you know, I don't want anymore of your visits. I don't want shit from you. So please, leave me alone and get on with your life. Jen, what happened? - It's over. - What happened, Jen, why? What did you do to her, Michael. - Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, he didn't do anything. - No, what are you doing here, Mike? Why are you upsetting my sister? - I'm not tryin' to upset your sister, Top Cat. I'm just trying to get back in my life, that's all. - She doesn't want to be back together with you. And she told you that already. Now, listen to me, I don't wanna see you around here again. Or I'm gonna have to do somethin' you won't like. What are you gonna do, Top Cat? You're 19 years old. You're 19. - Don't be stupid. - He's 19 years old. - Listen to me, don't you be stupid and make Top Cat angry. - Watch your hands. Angry, what about my level of anger? Is anybody here concerned about how angry I am? - All right, I'm gonna give you 3 seconds. Get in your truck and go. One. Two. - Dick. You asshole, you hit me. - Yeah, I told you to get out of here, man. - So you hit me when l wasn't paying attention? - Yes, and I'm going to hit you again unless you get in the truck and go. - You've changed, Top Cat. Hey, Jen, I got news for ya. You'll never find a guy like me again as long as you live. I'm a good guy, Jen. And you blew it. - How'd it go, son? - Not so good, Pop. - All right, why don't you go in the living room, lie down, put on the Met game. I'll make us a meatloaf, how's that? - That sounds really good, Pop. - Hey, babe. The crib is done. And it looks terrific. - Good. Do you think you'll finish painting her room tomorrow? - Can't the painting wait a week? I mean, we're getting married this weekend, babe. - I don't want it to wait. - But why does it need to be tomorrow? - Because her room being done makes things feel real to me. It's important. - So waiting until after the weekend is going to make it feel less real? - Yes. We said we'd have it done by the wedding. - I'm gonna get a beer. TC. Jimbo, this isn't good, man. - What's up, man, I thought you left hours ago. This isn't good. - No, this is good. And it's none of your fuckin' business. Miss, look, I think you should just go back, okay. - We're just - He's a happily - havin' a drink. - married man. - just go back inside, please. - Shut the fuck up. We're going for a drink. We're just going for a fuckin' drink. Look, you don't want... Just shut the fuck up, TC. Listen, you know what, Jimbo, I'll just - Crystal, come on. - Catch up with you - some other time. - Don't listen to him. - Hey, Jimbo. - We're just goin' - for a fuckin' drink. - Let her go. - Let her get inside. - It's not a fuckin'... Let her get inside, just let her go inside. - She's fine. - What the fuck. God damn it, what the fuck are you doing, man. Just let her go, okay, come on. What the fuck are you doin'? Think about this, all right, just think about it. Think about your wife and about it. You're gonna ruin your whole fuckin' marriage. - My fuckin' marriage is shit anyway. My marriage is fucked, man. You wanna know what's fuckin' wrong with me? You wanna know what's fuckin' wrong, is that what it is? Is that what my wife wants to know? Did she send you? She didn't send me. what my fuckin' brother wants to know and his perfect little fuckin' wife? What's wrong with Jimbo, is that it? Come on, Jimbo, just relax, sit down here, all right, I'm gonna get some coffee. - I don't want fuckin' coffee, all right. Look, it's all gonna work out. - It's not gonna work out, man it's fucked. And you know why? Why? - You know why Julianna hates me? - She doesn't hate you. - She fuckin', she should, and you know why? I can't have kids, man. - What do you mean you can't have kids? - She wants babies, she wants babies. And for a year we were fucking trying and then... It wasn't happenin', man. So a couple of months ago, I went to the doctor and he told me I had some hypothalamic, pituitary, shit... so, spermyish, it's this thing, I'm totally and completely infertile, man. - Man, I'm sorry. - No chance of having a kid. I didn't know. - I can't have a kid, you think she's going to fuckin' stay with me if I can't have a kid. She's gonna understand... to fuckin' understand. Paulie's gonna have a kid. Paulie's gonna have a kid. My little brother, he's gonna have a kid. That's what a fuckin' man is. Someone who can have a kid. My little brother's gonna have a fuckin' kid and I can't. I can't even be his best man, what the fuck? He was my best man, he was my best man. - Hey, Sue, I'm thinkin' about going to Dez's for a couple of beers tonight, if that's all right. It's almost midnight. Actually, it's only 11:15. - Actually, that's not the point, Paulie. The point is, is that I'm pregnant and I'm gettin' scared, because you're so off in your own shit. In your own feelings. And here I am, just sittin' here waitin' for you to take care of me. - Sue, look, I mean, I think you're kind of overreacting. I mean, I did take care of the crib today, right? I mean, I finished the crib. - Overreacting? It's been months since you've given me flowers. How about a little romance, Paulie? You know what would be nice, occasionally? Breakfast in bed. Or better yet, how about a foot massage? Do you know what it's like to be on your feet all day, five and a half months pregnant, planning a wedding that your fiance has absolutely no interest in, and working your ass off? - Hey, you know what, Sue, I mean, look. I don't see you makin' me breakfast in bed. - You are not fucking pregnant, Paulie. And I have to do everything. And when you actually do contribute, it's like pulling teeth. Like the God damn crib for example. - Yeah, 'cause I'm not under any pressure, right? I'm runnin' around all week tryin' to keep everybody happy. But that's nothin'. What about my happiness? Please, Sue, I mean, look. I don't mean to sound unsympathetic, all right. But why does it always have to come back to you? You know, why? - Paulie, I'm so sorry. I mean, you have so many outings to plan. The softball games, and the fishing trips, and the golf outings. Your stupid fuckin' band. You know what, that's a lot. You know what, fine. You know what, I'll just stay home, okay? - No, it's not about that. I miss my friend. I just want my friend back. And I don't even know if you want this. If you want me. If you want this baby or any of this. This whole life. - What? Hey, it's me, TC. Look, I need a favor. - Well, then you called the wrong guy, TC. Come on, I don't need this right now. I got Jimbo right here passed out. He's in a bad way, and he's been drinkin' all day. I just don't want to bring him home. Did you call Paulie? - Paulie doesn't need to deal with this shit right now. Is that Paulie? - Paulie. - Come on, relax. - All right, bring him over here, but listen, TC. Listen real close, okay? - Such an ass, man. Uno, dos, tres. Shut the Hell up, that sounds awful. I know it sounds awful, that's why I'm practicin'. What the Hell is this? - It's Jimbo, dad, he's all drunk. You're still a pack of idiots. What did we do, we're helpin' him out. We gotta get him some coffee. Dude, what is this, Little House on the Prairie? Get him on the couch. How'd this happen? How'd this happen, practice. How else does it happen, he's a drunk. I'll talk to him in morning. You son of a bitches. You wake me up the middle of the night. You were up anyway, watchin' porno. What are you arguin' about? Jimbo. Cover yourself up. Jimbo, look at this, hey, daddy. I was jokin'. - You've gotta be fuckin' kidding me. You said to her, "I don't see you making me breakfast in bed." - Well, she was screamin' her head off at me. You know, I mean, like a crazy woman. - Yeah, she's pregnant, she's allowed to scream at you. - All the time? - Yeah, It's called hormones. - Look, I know I'm supposed to be excited for the wedding, and for the most part I am. The thing that scares me are those moments when I'm not excited, like tonight for example, you know? - Can I just say, I think you're blowin' it. I mean, that's just her, she's lookin' for something. She's askin' for help. And you're sittin' here at this bar. What are you doing? - Yeah, you know what it is, Dez? It's like, a wedding is one thing. You know, there's all the insanity that goes around that, and preparing for that. And everyone gets nervous before they get married. But, you know, we got a kid comin' in a couple of months. A kid that we didn't plan for. And I guess I'm just, you know, I don't know if I can be a good dad, you know. I don't know if I can do it. - Let me paint you this little scenario, okay? Sue gets done with your indecision. All right, she can't deal with it anymore. And you guys break up. And say, down the road, like three years down the road, she meets this guy and he's a great guy, right. And he's not a coward. And there's some night that you don't have visitation rights, right. And this guy is reading stories to your kid. He is tucking your kid into bed. This other man is loving your kid. And at some point your, you know, your boy or your girl is gonna start calling this guy daddy. - Look, I'm not sayin' I want some other guy raise my kids. I'm just saying', look, I love Sue and I want the baby, I'm just - Then there's no problem. All right, listen, there's no problem, go home. - Thank you, Desmond. - My gosh. He's out like a light in there. Where did you guys go? - He took me someplace call the Foxy Hutch, something like that. Apparently he's a platinum member, too. Yeah, tell me about it. - Son, you don't go there, do you? - No, Pop, I would never go there. - Good. - Not Mikey. - All right, boys, that's it for me. You'll clean up, won't you, son? - Yes, Pop. - Good to see you, Tony. - Yeah, good to see you, Mr. Sullivan. - My boy will forgive you eventually. He gets that stubborn streak from his mother. But she always came around too. - I love you, Pop. I love you too. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Let me ask you a question about being gay. Off the record, all right? Off the record. - Fine, fine, off the record. - Dating, that's gotta be like, that's kinda weird, right? - Mikey, what are you getting at? - Okay, it's gotta be easier to date if you're gay, right, because with girls it's like, you gotta know what she likes, and it's a whole deal. But with guys, guys are horny all the time. You just meet two guys, boom. It actually would just be easier that way, with two guys. - No, It's the same thing, man. If you wanna meet somebody and just hook up and just, you know, get your leather stretched or whatever, that's easy, man. But if you wanna meet somebody and make it special, make it count, that's tough too, man. That's always tough, no matter what you are. You know what I mean? - I probably should have thought this through before we got into all the particulars. - You asked. - I know I asked.

Not a chance. Knows what? - How about you, Pops, you know my secret? I'm old, I'm not stupid. What secret? - Guess. - Man, I'm way too fuckin' hung over to guess anything. What? - Check it out, all right. TC is gay. - Bullshit. - That's right, I got a boyfriend to prove it. - He's got a boyfriend. Good for you. Yeah. - Jesus Christ, Pop, I can see your feet. - Paulie, hey, listen. Before you say anything, I know I've been a prick all week and... Can we talk? It's pretty important. I didn't know how to deal with it. I still don't know if I can deal with it. - Look, well, you can still have kids, Jim. You two will adopt. God, come on, that's what the Doctor said. That's such bullshit, Paul. It's not the same thing and you know it. - Look, man, it is the same thing. Any asshole can get a girl pregnant, all right? That doesn't take any talent. But to be a dad, to be a good dad. Doesn't seem to be many guys who can do that. - When I found out you two were havin' a kid, I just snapped. I did, I mean, you're my younger brother, okay. And you had your world together and my life's fallin' apart. I mean, it's not supposed to be that way. Like, you were the punk kid who was tryin' to hang out with me and my friends, you know. - Yeah, you liked it better when you could beat the shit out of me everyday? - Yeah. Yeah, I liked that a lot. Seriously... I know I've been tough the last couple of months to deal with. I'm sorry. Can you forgive me? - Of course, man, come on, you're my brother. Just talk to me next time. Don't let it get all weird like this. What about Julianna, you know? I can't... This shit is so hard for me, this emotional stuff. - Well, you just gotta tell her as straight as you can, man. Just be honest. - I can't call her. Send her e-mail? Can you do it for me? - Look, man, you're gonna be fine. Just tell her the same way you told me. - She's gonna to leave me. She's not gonna leave you, she loves you. Why? Look, a year from now, you know, you're going to adopt a kid and you're going to have a big fat smile on your face. My Chinese and Romanian kids can play with your kid. - Well, is everything all right? I mean, the guys called me last night in the middle of the night and woke me up. What the hell is wrong with you? - Listen. There's something I gotta talk to you about, okay? - Okay. - Okay, I know I've been really hard to be around for awhile. Don't think I'm not aware of that, okay? But there's a reason, and it wasn't just things were bad at work. Okay, so, a couple of months ago I went to see a doctor, right? - It's okay, baby, what's wrong? Okay, you're scaring me. - They did some tests, okay. They told me l can't have kids. Baby, and I knew how bad you wanted 'em. And I thought you was gonna leave me. You can't leave me. No, it's all right, it's okay. I was so worried. If you need to leave me, I understand. I just want you to be okay. TC, you gotta go, he's your Father. It's the right thing to do. - I don't think it's a good idea, I just don't. - It is, he's your father. If I can take it, he can take it. He loves you more than anybody on Earth. You're his son. Go ahead, good luck. - All right, thanks. You sure you don't want me to stay? - No, I'm good, thanks, man. - Gay pride, woo-hoo. - Dad? Dad? Dad, it's me, TC. Look. You look great, man. I feel like crap. - I don't know, man, I... Come on, you know you need to do this. - Why do I need to do it? That's stupid that I need to do it. - Come on, don't be a candy ass.
