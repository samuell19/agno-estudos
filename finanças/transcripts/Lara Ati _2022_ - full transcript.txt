GOD DOESN'T SLEEP God bless. Wait… Where are you going? Going to the mall to shop. You're taking us there, Jok. This isn't part of our deal, on weekends I use the car and Dad uses the motorbike. Right, Dad? I am accompanying your mother. What if she goes missing? But… I have plans. If you don't take me, how will I get there, by the public minibus? How could you? I'm already all dolled up. What if the driver flirts with me? Then your father will get angry and they'll fight. What if your father gets arrested? Do you want me to get arrested? If I get arrested, your mom will run away. Watch your mouth! Okay, let's go. That's more like it. Ajeng, go and close the gate. No, I don't want to. Tell the maid to close the gate. We don't have a maid, Dad. Oh, you're right. Let's buy one at the mall. Look at your father, he falls asleep every time he rides a car. Let him, Mom. Mom. I actually wanted to go to Farah's house. - Will you be long? - Probably not… Probably? If you're going to stay long, can we go to the mall first? If we go to the mall first, I have to drive south… Then north, then south and then north again. Okay, but make it fast. I don't want to miss the sale. Yes, Mom! That's more like it. AS HEAVY AS MY JOB IS, MY LOVE FOR YOU IS STILL HEAVIER What's this? - Are you job hunting? - Don't be a smart ass. - See! - Wait! Are you going to propose to Farah? - What? - Propose? Yes, Mom. Look at this. Proposing to Farah, Jeng? - Yes, Mom! - No, what? You are out of line! Why didn't you tell us you're proposing? Are we no longer your parents? Earthquake… Watch your mouth! Why is it so noisy? Joko was going to propose to Farah without telling us. This boy has guts. What are you doing, Jok? You want to just… Give her oxygen? Oh, my God, who wants to propose to her? I just want to show Farah's father this. Look, read! It's not a marriage proposal. Job promotion letter. Yes. - I see… - I see… So you got a promotion? Yes. Thank God, smart boy! I'm smart because I got a promotion? Looks like Farah's neighbors are rich. So many cars. Where's the car dealer? You think this is a car showroom? Wait, there's a parking attendant? I think there is an event going on here. Okay, wait here for a bit. Don't take too long, Jok! Okay. I'll leave the AC on. Right. The souvenir is an essential oil! Cool. - And this is just the engagement party. - What is this, eye drops? If you use this on your eyes, it will smell good! Silly! I miss going to Vivi's place. - Me too. - Yes, me too. I really miss it. How's your husband? - All good. - Far! Joko. Wait a moment… Far, whose engagement is this? Why are you all dolled up? This is… Joko… I admit you are a real man for coming to your ex-girlfriend's engagement party. What? Far, who is this guy? This is… What? Hasbi, my fiancé. What? Fiancé? Farah, go and greet Ummi's family inside. You too, Hasbi. - Go greet them! - Wait, sir, wait. - Wait… - Far, wait! What's going on? I'll explain what's going on. You need to be patient now. Patient people are loved by God. Not like this… If you really care about Farah, you have to let her go. - It's better for you to go home. - Sir! Just go home. Right. Problem solved. All good. - Boy, you look sad after visiting Farah's. - What? Is it still closed? - Is everything okay? - All good, Mom. - Why still closed? Should I force open it? - Let's go then. Well then, take care, boy. IN THE END, THE ONES WHO STRUGGLE WILL LOSE OUT TO THE ONES WHO HAVE MONEY Damn it. Excuse me, sir. Please check. Jok. Hey! What are you doing? This, sir? Joko's work is done, I'm giving it to him. Throwing away papers! Does your father own a paper factory? No, sir. I'll cut your pay! Pick it up! Yes, sir. What are you looking at? Nothing, sir. Get back to work! I am currently working, sir. Are you done? Come on, Jok. Please stop being sad. Yeah. If you think about it, Farah is so cruel. Yeah, Jok, I can't bear to see you like this. Then just close your eyes. You don't have to actually do it. Let me tell you. Finding "the one" is difficult. Not all men can find her. Except me. Worked hard outside my hometown, I found a wife who is beautiful, caring, understanding, good at cooking, loving to children… Hey! Why are you being a show-off? You put a love spell on your wife! But I married her first. And then I put a spell. Hey. Heartbreak doesn't feel good. But like it or not, you have to go through the process. Hear me out. Since today is Friday, what if we go to Fadli's café and watch some live music? That's right! Time to loosen up. Rather than being mopey like a wet mop. - Come on, Jok. - Come on. Guys! I still have a lot of work to do. Seriously, I can't stand looking at you like this! I'll just close my eyes. Oh no… How could you let your friend close his eyes forever? He will have a lot of typos when writing, his work will be a mess and then this bank will go bankrupt… Fine! You're coming? For real? Yes! I'll wash up and get ready. You're coming too? You're only inviting Joko? - Pick that up! - Yes, sir. I cannot give any more discounts. I'm buying a lot, give me more discounts! But I was here first, sir. Ma'am, one moment. Me first… - Farah! - I want to buy more. - Farah! Please take care of them. - I'm buying one, two, three… How come I don't get any more discounts? Sir? Sir! This is the total. Oh, my God. How much, 420? Right. So cheap! Are you getting any profit? Here, take all my money. Just keep the change. It's the exact amount, sir. Exactly? Which one is the prophet brand dates? This one? The camel brand that people are talking about… Hey, you! What do you want? That's it, man! - That's right, man! - No way. Jok! You're here to have fun. It's too crowded. - Let's just go home. - Come, come, sit here. Sit properly. You are here now. You need to enjoy and be happy. Forget all of your troubles. Forget about Farah. So only Joko is allowed to sit? You didn't bring your own chair? Of course not. What do you think? I come here to fish. Watch out, you'll hit my customers! We really won't get any seats? You guys have been sitting the whole day at the office. You'll get hemorrhoids later. You and your excuses. Just enjoy the vibe. There are lots of pretty girls here tonight, like… Your friends are here and you just leave them? Wait. Farah just uploaded her engagement photo. What? Wow! The gold looks expensive. How many grams is it? Why are you talking about gold? Jok, let it go. Our soul mate is arranged by the Almighty. Who knows, maybe Farah's soul mate is Hasbi. Hey! Why did you say that? Wait… Look, I hope Joko will find someone that is better than Farah. - Amen? - Amen! - Amen? - Amen! Amen? The girl's name is Amira. You already got her number? You know someone on the inside? Tonight we have a special guest. Mr. Denny Caknan! Give him a round of applause! He is my idol. Let's go in front! Take a stroll in Prambanan In Prambanan, buying greens My name is Denny Caknan A handsome singer from Ngawi, yeah! Let's go in front! Wait, what about him? Jok, you want to be alone now, right? We'll go to the dance floor. Come join us if you want to. Will you be all right here all alone? - Yes, it's okay. Just go. - Let's go. - Are you sure? - Just go! Come on, let's go. You want to just sit here? Not coming to the front? Okay then. Hey, new kid! If he orders something, make it free. Because what? Know what? Already know anyway! Honey, when you're massaging me, please do it wholeheartedly. That's too much pressure. You want to break my leg? You talk too much. Dad. You said you are going to fix the Wi-Fi. I still can't access it from my room. That's why you don't put your room too far away. You're the one who built the house. You can do your work here, Jeng. I can't concentrate, Mom. Can you turn the TV off? Wait a minute. Fine. Your brother bought a device for Wi-Fi, so it can reach your room. Call your brother about it. Where is your brother? Did he bring the house key? He went out with his friends. So he can forget about Farah leaving him. Leaving him? Is she moving away? No, Mom. I mean… Moving… What is it? You are rambling. What's going on between your brother and Farah? They broke up, Mom. Broke up? Ouch! My leg. What happened? Call your brother now! Tell him to come home! Yes, Mom. I'm so stupid. JOKOSIKJOKO: I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY WITH YOUR CHOICE, FAR. HASBI666: OF COURSE SHE'S 100% HAPPY. SHE'S WITH ME. Shit. ALAN: WHERE ARE YOU? PLEASE CONTACT ME, IF YOU HAVE TIME OKAY, I WON'T BOTHER YOU ANYMORE MAMA: STOP FEELING SAD. GOD DOES NOT SLEEP. Spaghetti. Sweet soy sauce. - Thank you. - Yeah. Sorry, you want to use it too? Yes, but it's okay. Go ahead. Okay then. Thank you. You also like to eat spaghetti with sweet soy sauce? Not only spaghetti, I usually add sweet soy sauce to most of my foods. This is the first time I've met someone who likes sweet soy sauce as much as I do. Yeah. Because it will not taste right if I don't add any sweet soy sauce. By the way, has anyone ever protested? People around me are already used to it. They know how much I really like sweet soy sauce. That's good. I still get scolded. They said I don't appreciate the food. Really? Even though I never forced anyone to follow my eating habit. Who said that? Ask them to face me, the number one sweet soy sauce lover in the world. I will jab them with this fork. Actually, I'm the number one. Oh, really? Okay, both of us are the number one. We share the title. Please eat. Right. Let me introduce myself. What a pick-up line. Is it any good? I'm Joko. Ayu. Ayu. By the way… AJENG By the way… You seemed so enthusiastic singing the song. Do you like the song or are you feeling… Sad? Actually, it's a bit complicated at the moment. Relationship? How about you? You seemed to remember the lyrics so well. My girlfriend left me to be engaged with someone else. - Sorry to hear that. - It's okay. That's life. - Hello? - Hello? - Hello? - Yes? Is Joko there? - What? - Joko! Is Joko with you? Joko? Yes, he's with me. What? - What? - Tell him to come home! - Tell him to come home! - Home? Mom wants him to come home. Okay, Jeng. Yes, Jeng. - Tell him now! - I will take him home. Okay, thanks. - Wait. - Yes. Come on! - This is my chance. - What? Let's go home. What? I haven't take a picture with Denny Caknan. Here you go. Come! I want to be in the picture. Just Google it! Come on! What? Jok. What? What is… What? What is it? What? Well, Ajeng called. Your mom's looking for you. Let's go home. I don't feel like going home. See, Ajeng is calling me again. Let's go home. Ajeng is waiting for you. Ajeng is waiting. Let's go! I have to go now. My mother is looking for me. I'm a grown man and my mother is looking for me. It's embarrassing. Don't be sad. I believe that God does not sleep. Someone nice will meet someone nice. Goodbye. - See you guys! - Yeah! See you later! Hey, why are you coming? What? I want to make sure that you arrive home safely. Brother… Hey. I'm so sorry, my tongue slipped. I found out from Farah's Instagram. I didn't know you hadn't told Mom. It's okay. It's time they know. Tell Mom that Farah is the one who wanted to break up so she won't be so angry. Jeng, your package. What? What is it? I have brought your package safely. Thank you. What? That's it? I shouldn't have brought him home in a hurry. Shit! Asalamualaikum. - Walaikumsalam. - Walaikumsalam. Jok! Did you think it through? How could you break up with Farah? Think about it, Jok. What does Farah lack? She is pretty. She comes from a good family. I already saw her as my Arabic daughter-in-law. Why did you let her go? Think about it, Jok. How old are you now? When are you going to get married? You never listen to your parents! You always do what you want. You are so troublesome! You never listen to us! Mom. I'm tired. I want to rest. You're always tired when I'm talking to you. You do as you please! I'm so irritated with you! Enough… Did you just shut your door on me? I'm still talking! - Honey! - What? Can you talk to your son? - Your son. - Your son. - Your son. - Your son. I can't give birth. Our son. Where are you going? I'm fixing the Wi-Fi. Where is the Wi-Fi again? Is the Wi-Fi still not working? No, not yet. I need to tether with my phone. Wait… It's my phone number. - Hello? - Hello? You found Ayu's phone? Where did you find it? Oh no, Uncle, I mean, sir, her phone accidentally got switched with mine. Oh, I see. This must be him. Here is Ayu. - Joko? - Hello. I'm so sorry our phones got mixed up. It's okay. Your phone is also with me. Thank God I didn't put a password on my phone. What if we switch them back now? Just share the location of your house. I will deliver it to you now. It's already late, Jok. What if we meet up tomorrow at the cafe… At 2 p.m.? Sure, sounds good! Okay, see you tomorrow. Sorry, ma'am, we're not open yet. Do you want me to make you a drink? Sure. - Ayu! - Hey! I'm sorry. Did you wait long? It's all right. Your phone… Wait a minute. No scratches at all. - Good. This is your phone. - Thank you. I was so relieved when you picked up the call. What are the chances our phones got mixed up? Yeah, how could you? I didn't mean it. It was an accident our phones got mixed up… Oh, I wasn't talking about you. This is the guy who took my phone! I took it by accident, I didn't steal it. It wasn't on purpose. Thank you. What's your Instagram? It's… What a username. Yeah. I'm following you. Being followed by someone pretty. Is this Mr. Bandi? You know Mr. Bandi? He's my father. Mrs. Bandi? Mrs. Bandi is Mr. Bandi's wife. My mother. Why? You know my parents? Oh, my God. Jok, it's me! Ayu! Mr. Fred's daughter. I was your neighbor! Oh, my God! Right! Ayu! That's why you seemed so familiar to me! - I felt the same way. - How are you? Good! What are the chances of us meeting again like this? Your Javanese is still good! Of course, but my accent is a bit of a mess. Obviously, since you lived in Germany for a long time, right? - Yes. - Do you have any plans? Not really. Why? Well… Do you want to come to my house and meet my dad, mom, Ajeng? Don't you miss them? Of course! Do you want to? - I do! - I brought a car. - Thank you, sir. - Okay. - Take care. - Wait… I'm taller now, even though I was circumcised late. Jok, isn't this the car that used to pick us up? Yes! You remember? I usually use a motorbike, Yu. But on the weekends, my dad uses it. So, I use this car. Cool car. It's durable. Yeah, hop in. Everyone inside? - Yes. - Okay, let's go. How to solve this equation? Not like that, Jok. The 12 needs to be moved over here. Wow… It's still here! That's the calculation you wrote. Dad tried to remove it, but it's already imprinted. This! This is the CD that Mr. Bandi used to play. This is the correct way. Oh… like that. Ayu, Joko, move your hands like this. What, Dad? Like this… Here, here… it feels good. You still remember. Seriously! I feel like a time traveller! Right. Sorry, Yu. Do you feel hot? It will be hotter when I'm driving. The AC doesn't work, just open the window. Why has it not been repaired since the prehistoric times? I was actually thinking of selling this car. For some extra cash to get married. You're getting married? Yeah. Wait… Didn't you say last night that your girlfriend got engaged with someone else? Yeah, that's it. I was thinking of marrying her. But she got engaged to someone else. That's life. It's a long story, Yu. Let's not talk about it, I'll be sad. So here's the story, Yu. I'll tell you on the way. Okay. Welcome back to Peneleh, Ayu. Please come. Peneleh, dude… It hasn't changed at all. Right, the last time you were here was… Sixth grade, Jok. A long time. Yeah, here. Dad, Mom, Ajeng, come here. Can you guess who this is? Who is she? Ayu! - You remember! - Sis Ayu! Everyone still remembers me! Sis Ayu! - Sir. - Yeah. - Ma'am. - Yeah. - Sis Ayu! - Ajeng! How have you been? Good, kid. Who are you with in Surabaya? With Dad and Mom, sir. - Dad and Mom all good? - Good. - Thank God. - How long have you been here? It's been almost one month, Jeng. Yesterday, I accidentally met Joko. You didn't tell me you wanted to come! I did not prepare anything to cook. - Should I slaughter the chicken? - Don't talk nonsense! - Don't trouble yourself. - Yes, Mom. What if I take you to eat at Lek Har? - Lek Har's rujak cingur? - Yes! At the end of the alley? She still remembers. Do you want it? - I do! - Okay. Okay! - Can I come? - Okay, let's go. - I'll be back in a moment. - Yeah, right. - Goodbye, ma'am, sir. - Yeah, right, girl. - Honey, should I slaughter the chicken? - Don't! LEK HAR'S RUJAK CINGUR By the way, Yu, so last night it was you? - I didn't recognize you. - Yeah. So you're back here for good? Why? Are you not happy? What are you saying? So unfriendly! Of course I'm happy my friend is back. Back to your old house? What do you mean, Rik? The old house was sold and turned into a mini market. Seriously? Yes. If Ayu comes there, she must be scanned before entering. How fun all five of us can be reunited! Remember when we used to climb the mango tree at Riki's house? My favorite. Does the tree still bear some mangoes? Not really, Yu. Dad no longer takes care of it. Mom is the one who planted it. But Mom is gone now. Dad is sad every time he looks at the tree. May she rest in peace. I'm so sorry, Rik. When? Three years ago. Riki's parents were so romantic together. I used to wish my relationship with my future boyfriend could be just like theirs. Same, me too. Hey. My parents are faithful, till death did they part. Unlike you. What… I don't even have a girlfriend. There's one girl, but she's difficult to get. Yeah. These days, is it still possible to have a relationship like Riki's parents? Seems impossible? One, two, three, four, five… This must be Ayu! Still remember me, sir? Of course. It's not everyday I see a Caucasian eat here. Really? Not since 1945 when the Caucasians… Were outcasted by Bung Tomo. Sir, I want to order five portions. Wait, wait… This is not a restaurant. Get in line and order there! Wait, what? The line is so long. I will line up. I'm the only one who gets in line? Okay, fine. It doesn't have to be everyone. Tired of sitting? So chatty. You're still sad? The more I stalk, the more I'm heartbroken. Let's talk about you, not me. Do you have a boyfriend? I do… I think. You think? He's the guy on my phone's wallpaper. Oh yeah, that guy. Who is he? His name is Alan. Where is he from? He lives in Jakarta. He doesn't approve of my decision to move to Surabaya. And he's been ignoring me since then. You're just the same like me. Sad and mopey! Is there enough, sir? I want five. - How many? - Five. Nonsense! I will be sold out if you order five. You don't want to be sold out? If other people want to order and I'm sold out, I will be ashamed. But you can go home earlier, Lek? Go home? My wife will scold me if I go home earlier than normal. Come on, sir! It's only five! No can do! Mom. My pretty daughter, you just arrived home? Yeah. Are you busy? Plenty of work. Alone? Where's Dad? I really don't get it. Right? I'm sitting here and just lost more than one million dollars. Yes, but I told you, I only took the maximum risk. Capital investment… - Dad, have you eaten? - The asset loss prevention contract… That's what was wrong. But I told you… Right, guys. That's it for today. Get back to work. Just got home? Gosh. Dad… What? My pants? It's okay, no one sees it. If everyone in Indonesia sees it, then I will be embarrassed. Dad just ranted. Mom kept on frowning. Tell me what's going on? Okay, Yu. My company in Germany just got scammed. How come? My employee was careless. Even though he already has a good salary. Same. The sales of Gendis chocolates keep on declining. I'm not sure why. Maybe people are bored, Mom. Grandfather's regular customers are already old. They don't eat chocolate anymore. Nowadays, only young people eat chocolates. What's your idea? I can be the project leader of Gendhis' rebranding. I will do a very detailed research. Are you sure you can do it? I can do it. So? It's okay. After all, she will inherit this business. If she is handling it from now on, we can focus on business in Germany, right? You're right. Oh, right. Mom, Dad, I have a surprise. Try it, Mom! - Wait a minute. - Come on, Mom! Just one bite. Gosh. Okay, I'm trying it. Lek Har's rujak cingur! - Lek Har? - You still remember, Mom? Of course! Delicious! It still tastes the same! You still remember how to get there? So… I was accompanied by Joko. Joko? The guy who accidentally took my phone, Dad. Turns out, Joko is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Bandi. What? Really? What a coincidence! Mrs. Bandi from Peneleh? - Yes. - I miss them. I'll come with you if you visit. - Do you want to? - Sure. Yeah, sure. Let's all visit! - I will let Joko know. - Okay. - Excuse me. - Excuse me, Mr. Bandi, Mrs. Bandi. Mrs. Nadia, Ayu, Mr. Fred. You still look very beautiful, just like your daughter! Look at yourself, you look fresh! - Very fresh! - I gave her formaldehyde. - That's why she still looks beautiful. - So funny! Ma'am, sir, here are some chocolates. Thank you so much, kid. Diabetes. We don't have anything to give them. Just give them the house. - Then what about us? - We'll be homeless. - Why don't you guys come inside? - We forgot to let you in. - Come in. - I was about to go home. - You've got one foot in the door. - No, don't go. Come in. - Come in, girl. - Let's wash up, then eat. - Please come in. - Don't worry. Ajeng, you've grown! - Ajeng! - Sis! - Ma'am, how are you? - Hey, beautiful girl! - Please help yourselves. - Thank you. It's nice to get together this afternoon. Right, fabulous. Honey, this is Mr. Fred's favorite dish. Not this one, Mr. Bandi, but this one. This is the table. Under the table… There's a snake… Don't be sad… Because it is the way… Tewel dish, Pindang fish… Don't complain, let's just eat. This is my favorite, Mr. Bandi. Do you have it in Germany? Of course not, Mr. Bandi. That's why you come back here. Ayu is all grown up. She is now the manager of Igor's. Ajeng is currently in college, studying to be a doctor. Not to mention Joko… He is working at the bank now. Big salary. He already has a respectable position. His position is sitting at the chair. You have successful kids. Whose kids? Did you forget? Of course they're mine! Hello there. - Hello. - Hello. - Fadli? - Yes, sir. - Fadli! - Who? Fadli, Honey. He used to be a naughty kid. One time, he wanted to use the PlayStation and I didn't allow it. - He got mad! - And then? And then he cuts the power of the house. Uncle, how come you only remember the bad stuff. - I was a kid. - How about now? Now I'd cut the whole district's power. - Hey! - You rascal. - This kid! - Come and join us! - Come eat. - Yes, okay. No need, sir, ma'am. We're going to head out. Where to? Can we go, Uncle, Aunty? Where are you guys going? To the night market, Aunty. - Is it far? - No, it's close by. Is it okay, Mom, Dad? It's okay. Let the kids be with the kids, the adults with adults. Is that right? Okay. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - I have no idea about this. - Come on. - Come on. - Where to? I don't know, I just arrived. My brother seems to be on a bad mood. Ayu has also been very quiet. Yeah, so? So we should cheer them up. Won't we just bother them? Let's just split up later… So they can be on their own. We will also be on our own. Are we going, Jeng? Wait, I'm getting my bag! Wait a minute. Just the two of us? FERRIS WHEEL, SWAN BOAT, HAUNTED HOUSE, LAKE - Brother, I'm going that way. - Yeah. Jok? That's why you use your eyes. You think I don't? Gosh, Jok. How is it? Has Alan replied to your messages? He didn't pick up any of my calls. I tried calling him 14 times today. Seriously? - Yes. - You're crazy, Yu. You have to make a recovery! Open your chat now with Alan. Open! Now text him. "Jok, I'm already outside." But I'm already here with you. No, it's for Alan. Seriously? Yes, just type. Okay. Just send. Jok! What if he gets angry? No, trust me. He won't be angry. Trust me. He replied right away! I told you. - After one week. - Right. Okay, what should I reply? Wait, don't panic… Delete the previous text. And then type… "Sorry, wrong chat." He will be angry! Trust me. Come on! Send. Done, sent! - You are responsible if he's angry. - No. Trust me, I know how guys like Alan act. Cut my finger if I'm wrong. Sorry, Jeng. I didn't mean to. I thought you intended to hold my hand. May I? Of course not, we're not crossing the street. Just trying my luck. You like me, don't you? What? See? You're a playboy, but you get flustered. I'm not a playboy, I'm just friendly to women. There's a difference. So do you like me or are you just being friendly? - Your phone. - My phone? Jok! He's calling! - See. - Okay. Don't pick up. - Don't pick up. - But why? He's calling. Listen to me. How many times did he ignore you? Fourteen times right? He should call you more than that. Then you can pick up. Just silence your phone and enjoy the vibe. Stop thinking about what's far away. - Okay. - Let me turn it off. - Popcorn? - Sure. - What's up? - Yes, Jeng. What do you mean? Earlier, Jeng. - What? - I like… Jeng! What? I like you, Jeng! I'm still nervous to tell you that directly. My heart beats so fast. Let's take it slow, okay? Dude! You like my sister? Brother-in-law. You two are the same, you like to surprise people! I can get a heart attack! - Hey. - What? What? Seventeen missed calls? 17 MISSED CALLS FROM ALAN Hello? FINALLY! I ALREADY TALKED TO ALAN. DO YOU HAVE PLANS TOMORROW? LET ME TREAT YOU. OKAY, TOMORROW AFTER WORK, LET'S MEET AT BUNGKUL. BUNGKUL PARK Bungkul Park is so cool now. You guys come here a lot? Yes, our office is just over there. That one. Oh yeah, this is our friend from work, Cokro. Cokro, a famously commendable man. Got one child. I'm Ayu. Ayu, what kind of friend are you to Joko? We're childhood friends. - Riki too. - I thought you were more than friends. What's the matter? It's okay. It's just my GERD. Wow, you are so talented. You still like to draw? Yes, it's my hobby. Maybe he feels stuffy in the office. Your job is heavy? Not my passion, Yu. He actually wanted to study design, but ended up studying accounting. That's how I ended up becoming a bank employee. Ayu, what is your occupation? I am running my family's business, Igor's Pastry. I'm taking charge of Gendis chocolate. My parents used to tell me… When they were still dating, they'd buy this chocolate on Valentine's. What about you guys? Have you tried it? Not yet. Maybe a long time ago? Nowadays? Never, right? Never. My theory is correct. What theory, Yu? Gendis chocolate is already outdated. I'm thinking of replacing the original, milk, and dark flavors with more modern flavors. Sorry, Yu. I don't think you should remove them completely. What if Dad misses Mom and wants to feel nostalgic? They're your regulars after all. Yes, Yu. It's better to add some new flavors that are more modern. Also, when I see this design, from my perspective… I'm sorry, Yu, but this is ugly. What? The design is important, Yu. It will also increase your sales. For example… That's the cilok cart they bought from. The cilok tastes good, right? But look, no customers. Because he's right under a green tree, and the cart is also green! If only the design is better, like this. And this is just my vision. Let me try. The key is to know the importance of design and cleanliness. What if the color is changed to be more eye-catching, like red? Add a brand logowith an interesting design, it will attract a lot of people who want to try it. Prioritize hygiene by wearing a mask and gloves while serving so people will trust the brand. If the design is good and attractive, with marketing on social media, taking orders online as well, the sales will be able to skyrocket. It might end up becoming a nationwide franchise. And it all starts with a good design, Yu. Wow, you really understand design, Jok! - Yeah, a little. - Hey. What if I offered you a job with me at Gendis Chocolates? Would you take it? - Take it, Jok! - It's not that easy. I'm not sure if I can take it! I'll just take a shot at your teeth! But this is what you wanted. Opportunity doesn't come twice. I'll also give you an extra box of sweet soy sauce! Okay, okay! For real? Yeah, let's do it! Thank you, Jok. This guy is always helping me out, guys! But if we're going to do this, we have to find a theme that suits the product, so I can design properly. What's something young people can easily understand? Love… Love? For example, you, Jok. How many times have you ranted about your love life this month? Not to mention Ayu, Riki, the couple over there, and the guy sitting alone over there… Everyone knows what love is. You are right. You are genius. He's smart. My fee is included in Joko's bill, okay? I made the right choice asking you for help. What do you want to eat? Riki, Cokro, come with us too? My wife already cooked. She already made chili paste, so I have to eat at home. If I don't, I will be turned into a chili paste. Me too, Yu. Dad asked me to bring home mixed tofu. If not, Cokro will become a chili paste. - Why me, dude? - Come on. We're happy enough to see Joko's spirits up. Yu, Jok, bye. - You're going now? - Yeah, right. Enjoy, Jok. - Two rawon, two warm teas. - Okay. RAWON TERRACE Jok, do you still want to go after Farah? Sorry. I meant that if you wanted to… I'm ready to help. It's hard, Yu. Her fiance is better than me in every way. Did you break up because of that? I think so. You think, right? So you're not sure? How to put this… I get dumped often… - For no reason. Often. - Wait. So this is not the first time? Jok. I think you should try to understand why this keeps happening to you. Do you want it to happen again when you have another relationship? Of course not. Go and meet your exes, ask them exactly why they dumped you. Think of it as a lesson. Hold on, meeting my exes? Exes are beings that should be avoided. Why should I meet and ask them? You're not making any sense. If you don't want to go alone, I'll accompany you. Delicious! Right? Great pick, Jok. Of course. Told you so. Dad, I have a question. What is it? Before you and Mom got together, did you have any ex-girlfriends? What are you talking about, do you think I was not popular? Well, I was not. I only had two relationships. I ended the first one and the second is your mother. Why did you decide to go after Mom? I just love her. I used to be very stubborn. That's why my ex couldn't stand me. After I met your mom, I became more patient, I listened and understood. That's why we're still together until now. I see now. So we have to understand ourselves better first, Dad? Yes, if you don't understand who you are, how can you understand others? I see. Now, go on… I want to fix the Wi-Fi. Hey, Wi-Fi! Wi-Fi? Wi-Fi, where are you? You always run away. YU, LET'S DO YOUR IDEA. Why are you here? I want to ask you. Ask what? Why did you break up with me? EX-GIRLFRIEND 1: SANDRA Drank means drunk, right? No, Jok. Drank is a verb. Oh, if it's a verb too, then speeding is drank-drank-drank. Not funny! Tasty, right? Needs more sweet soy sauce. Much more. Yes, San, we ate together everyday. But there's one problem. What? We were never in a relationship. Gosh, Jok! This next one was really your ex, right? You two dated? You did ask her to date you? Yeah, from what I remember. We used to call each other "Mommy" and "Daddy." That's disgusting. Dipshit! You're here just to ask me that? Well, yeah. Did you guys hear him? EX-GIRLFRIEND 1: LULUK Mommy, it's a really hot day, want to get some es campur? - Okay. - Let's go. Hey, Dude, you should do the class chores today. It's not my turn yet! Come on, I have some urgent matters. You do it okay? I also have some matters. Right, Mom? Not as important as mine. Besides, you usually do chores. You do it, okay? High five. As if. If you tell I'm the one who did the scribbles, I'll kick your ass! Tell him you did it! - Why? I didn't do anything. - Dude! I'm the king of Bulak Banteng, you don't want to mess with me! What's the matter now? Confess! Who did the scribbles? Among the three of us, the one who can draw the best is Joko. Did you do it, Jok? Yes, sir. I did it. Why, you, Jok. I'm suspending you! I'm annoyed you can't stand up for yourself. I'm the daughter of Udin Bacok, the chief thug in this area. I can't have a boyfriend like you! A pushover! You're too ignorant, Jok. Really? You never felt jealous at all. Even I was questioning whether or not we're dating. This is your ex-boyfriend? What? No, I don't know who he is. As if, freak! Nggi! Please don't treat me like this. Jok, please. See? You know my name, so you remember me! It's not important! Let's go! - Let's go. - Nggi, why be like that? I like adrenaline. I used to go street racing on the weekends. - Here. - Buy a laptop. I'm done now, we don't have to go to Farah's. Hey… Yu, please… Here, look at this, her pre-wedding photo. Wow, her dress looks great. Why did you say that, Yu? Sorry, Jok. - Let's go home. - Jok. Farah is your finish line. If you give up now, you won't be able to move forward. - But… - Jok. You deserve to be happy, Jok. Don't feel guilty and keep on questioning. Her house is far from here. Come on, let's go! - My mother is looking for me. It's late. - Let's go, come on. You disappeared! You're lucky I didn't call the National Search and Rescue Agency. We didn't chat for three months, Jok! No phone calls, or meet ups. I thought you didn't want to be with me anymore. But I truly love you, Far. EX GIRLFRIEND 5: FARAH But why have you never said it? You never showed it with your actions. If you keep your feelings to yourself… How am I supposed to know? Far, listen to me. We rarely chatted, rarely communicated, because I was focusing on my job for the last three months, Far. So I can get a promotion. - Hey, Jok. - Your father told me, I need to have a good salary, if I want to marry you. I was going after that, Far. When I did get a promotion, you were already with someone else. Jok, if you had explained it to me from the start, I would have waited. I'm sorry, but it's too late now. My father has already chosen Hasbi for me. Jok, the usual. Thank you. Hey, your girlfriend, Jok? So pretty. No, she's just a friend. Friend? Miss, are you interested in dating a satay seller? - What? - It's nice. I fan satays all the time, I can fan you all day long. Dude? What the hell? I'll break your skewers! Sorry, Yu, there's an error in his brain. Eat first, Jok. I don't have an appetite. You are so great for finishing today's mission. Top! Please, it was heartbreaking. But at least now you know the reasons, so you won't make the same mistakes. Yes. All this time, I wasn't a reliable boyfriend. All of my exes think I'm a pushover. I know that I'm not very good with words. Don't give up because of your flaws. Do you understand, Jok? It's not because you can't express what's on your mind, but because you don't know what you want for yourself. Now, what do you want, Jok? I want to eat the satay. So, do you want to be with me, miss? I'll kick your ass! What date is it? Ayu's revisions are a lot. Work revisions are also a lot. That's more like it. While you're young, you need to have a burning spirit! When you're married like me, you'll have different priorities. Taking care of your wife, your kids, not to mention, dealing with annoying in-laws. Sometimes I want to hit… My own head. That's true, Jok. You have to choose one. Instead of overworking yourself. Is that so? IGOR'S FINE PASTRY - Hey, Aunty! - Hey, Joko. - Hey, Uncle! - The bank employee is here. Yes. How neat. Yeah, just got back from the office. What a coincidence to see you. I have the designs here with me. - Please have a look. - That was fast. Let me see it, Jok. Looks good, Ma. Looks good, Jok! But that means we have to change the packaging. It's okay, we have to innovate. Ah, I can do that too. Hey, look at it first. Can you do this? - Like this? - Yeah. That looks hard. That's why your mouth shouldn't be as fast as a Formula One car. Why you, Bir. Where is Ayu? Why I don't see her? She's in the kitchen. - She's making the chocolates. - Yeah. Go meet her, it's okay. Is it okay to come inside? Bir, keep him company. - I have to go now. - Right now? - You can take this. - Oh, thank you. - Ma, let's go. - Please, please. - Is it far? - No, it's over there. Ayu is over there. Let's go this way. If we use the window, they'll think we are burglars. Jok! Hey! Come over here! Miss Ayu, here's… What's his name? - Hey, Yu! - Just in time. Here, try this. Hey, not you. Slides like a duck. How is it? Tastes like a street food, but not in a bad way! I was inspired after eating out with you. Try to guess what's inside? Ginger? It's cozy and warm, just like a girlfriend's hug. Hey! That can be the flavor's name. Girlfriend's Hug flavored chocolate! That's good! Sounds good. Like this? You don't have to actually do it. Now this one. Again? This is different. This one has a crispy texture. What is this crispiness? It's not glass for sure. You think this is Reog? It's almond crumbles. I baked it until it's crispy, mixed with chocolate, so the texture is different from others. It's great. The Reog explains. I think the flavor name could be… What? Ex-girlfriends' Tears flavored chocolate. - We can use that! - Yeah, right? - Yeah, it can. - Okay. This is the last one. There's a fruit in here? Just try it. How is it? This is different. A combination… A diversity of flavors. Diverse? Like NKRI? But it's true! I used a lot of dried fruits. If mixed with chocolate, it tastes just like rujak! You talk like a spokesman. Well, he's the chef. Oh, he's the chef? Sorry, Chef. What are you doing? I'm just afraid the recipe isn't fine. You and your words. How is it? Good. I swear all of them are tasty. This one is warm. This one is crispy. This one? I'm a little confused. It's a mixture of flavours put into one, like the feeling of… - Falling in love! - Falling in love! - Falling In Love flavored chocolate! - Falling In Love flavored chocolate! Right! Amazing. Perfect. This one will sell like hotcakes. I hope it will. - A little bit more! - Enough. Don't run away. You can't. - Come on. - Wait. Cheater! - Using phone calls as an excuse. - It must be my dad. Mr. Fred. Hello, Mr. Fred Hello? Surprise. Are you happy? Did you miss me, babe? I missed you so much. I missed you too. Wait, why didn't you tell me you're coming? I'm so surprised! Babe, if I tell you I'm coming, it won't be a surprise. - What happened to your face? - What? Oh, this? Nothing. You, come here. Come. Can you go get my bag? - Yu… - Hey, what are you doing? This is my friend. - This is… - Joko Harjono? How do you know? This reads Haryono, bro. Okay, babe, let's just go get some food. Okay. Jok, I'm going to go with Alan, okay? Okay, it's all right. Some noodles, bro? No. - Hello, brother-in-law! - Hello. There are so many revisions! Take it slowly. Don't rush or you'll make many mistakes. Replenish your energy first. Here. Welcome home, brother-in-law! Shut up! How cruel… Like a stepmother. Does he need the toilet? Who are you going with to the campus tomorrow? I think alone. - Can I accompany you? - It's very early. It's okay. I am actually being endorsed by a hotel here. But the hotel is so bad. I don't feel comfortable. Look at this. And the soap is also not liquid, babe. It's already late. Can I find accommodations somewhere else, babe? Oh, wait. There is a five-star hotel near my house. Look. This hotel looks really cool, babe! Do you want to stay here? Yeah, I do. Okay, I'll book a room. Are you coming with me? Of course not! What a douche bag. Is it available now? Yes, I have prepared it. What is it for? For buying medicines. Why buy medicines? We might have medicine here too… Medicines for what? For rats! Bring it here for me to drink, so my body can get fatter? What is it that you're feeling? I have headaches. Just switch heads with a klotok fish. I can't wash my face later if my head is eaten by cats. How much do you need? Three million. Don't give too much! He won't be able to pay. Why did you marry a woman like her? Just ignore her. - Where is the money? - Here. Just go home. - I'll go home now? - Yes. - Tell her I said goodbye! - Tell her yourself. Ning, don't bother yourself. I'm going home, I already drank coffee earlier. Who's making you a drink? Sugar is expensive. I'm sweeping the floor. Just ignore her. Be careful. When you walk, move your legs slowly. Of course, if I move my legs at the same time, I'll be walking like a vampire. Bye. Honey. You never change. Always responding to a friend. Just ignore him. Look at your friend. He's already old, but never got married. All he does is his hobby. You used to be like him. We got married late. We were not young. Thank God you listened to me. You can get retirement money, pet a rooster, and finance your children's education. It's all good. LUDRUK SAPARI RESIGNATION LETTER Jok, are you nuts? I'm serious, sir. You think finding a job is easy? - If so, find one for me! - But sir… Jok, if you feel bored, just take some days off. I've made up my mind, sir. I want to resign. You are crazy, Jok! Do you think you're at an age where you can do as you please? You have a habit of letting go of what's already good for you! I can be hospitalized for high blood pressure! That means you have resigned now? I still have one week to take care of my resignation. As an eldest son, you should have been reliable and set an example for your sister. Understand? But design is my true passion, Mom. I don't want to know! Mom, wait! Please hear me out! Mom, please listen to me! Don't take it personally. Be patient. - Thank you. - Okay. - Jok? Joko? - Hey. - Have you waited long? - No. The design is done. Look. Amazing. Cool! Thank God you finished them on time. Why? The revisions are minor. Yu, I have decided to quit my job. - Really? - Yes. And my mother found out. You know her mouth… I'm suffocated. Jok, if you are sure with your decision, my advice is… Just do it. I will totally support you. Look! The result of our conversation in Bungkul is right in front of our eyes. We have tried our best, Jok. We have to believe in our efforts, so no one will underestimate us again. Yes, you're right! Thank you so much, Yu. I think I'll go now. Don't you want to eat first? I'm in a hurry, Yu. If I eat here, I can't be in a hurry. This place is fancy, the food must be delicious, right? Brazillian crust, crash, cross, crash. Is the chef Ronald in ho? Well, see you later. Why does it have to be this convoluted? Like a traffic light intersection. - This has to be finished, Dli? - What? It's already 11 o'clock. - Hey. - What is it? I know you guys work in the morning. But I can't do this on my own. I can't. Here. Come here. This is a guy who is falling in love, Jok. Listen to him. Yeah, but I still think this is too much. What? Do you understand the concept of love? Jok, listen to me. Love needs sacrifices. Needs to be proven by actions. Let me ask you. How will Ajeng know I love her if I don't do anything to show it? Yeah, Jok. I'll put the lights on so we can finish sooner. Be careful, Rik. You care about me? Be careful with the lights. I borrowed them from the RW's office. Jeng! WIJAYA KUSUMA UNIVERSITY, SURABAYA Hi, Jeng. Am I late? - No, you're not. - No, right? Congratulations, Ajeng! Thank you! I ordered this, but I don't know how to properly put it on. - Is it a belt? - It's… No, open the knot first. Thank you. What won't I do for Ajeng? You're officially a doctor now. Please treat me, Jeng. Pay me first. Can I use BPJS? You can't! I have sores all over. - Jok? - Yes, sir. These are the materials for tomorrow's presentation. But now it's time to go home, sir? "Go home?" Why go home if you're coming back here tomorrow? But, sir… Work, no buts. YU, SORRY, THE REVISIONS WILL BE LATE. I HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. FARAH: JOK, CAN WE MEET? - Are you ready to order? - Yes. I'll have the 300 gram wagyu cube roll. You? We'll have two carbonara pastas. Just cancel the wagyu. No, babe, I want to eat steak. It's night time. Don't eat fatty foods, it's not healthy. But pasta is full of carbs. Okay, we'll just eat steak. But, babe, to celebrate me coming over to Surabaya and getting that job offer, what if this time is your treat? The owner of the launching I attended praised my content. He wants to collaborate with me again. But, babe, the payment has not been transferred. Okay, no problem. - So two wagyu cube rolls. - Two wagyu cube rolls. And I want sweet soy sauce on the side. Thank you. Please wait. Sweet soy sauce again? This is a fine dining restaurant, babe. Don't embarass us like that! Why? It's my order and I'm paying for it. It's up to me how I want to eat it. If you don't like it, you don't have to follow me. Why did you change? I don't know. I'm comfortable here. No one ever protests over sweet soy sauce. YU, WHY DIDN'T YOU REPLY? YOU WANT ME TO SEND YOU TO THE SATAY SELLER Excuse me. Hello, Jok. Hello, Yu. Why do you need more time? I'm sorry, Yu. My boss gave me a lot of work that I needed to finish. A lot of work, but why do you sound so happy? You can tell? I'm getting back together with Farah. She broke up with Hasbiand chose to be with me, Yu. Gosh, I'm so happy. Hello? Aren't you going to congratulate me? Yes. Congratulations, Jok. Congrats. Thank you. Who is it, babe? Ayu, my friend who I've been helping with designs. Okay, Yu, talk to you later. I'm still with Farah now. Let's take a photo first, over here. Here? Is this visible? Yes, it is. What if you two embrace each other more? - Hold hands? - Hurry up… Jeng, sorry, okay? You're taking too long. Ready, one, two, three. Done. Enjoy. I'm going inside now because I don't want to be a third wheel. Thank you. Gosh, I'm tired. Are you happy, Jeng? I'm very happy. I can't believe this tree… Really belongs to me. What if it's not real? So it's just a prank? No, I don't mean that. The tree is really yours, Jeng. But what if we're not friends with each other? What do you mean? Officially dating? Do you want to? I do. You don't want to think about it first? Usually girls need to think… You don't want to? I want to, Jeng. Of course I do! I want Jeng. This guy change girls… like cars in the showroom. You're so romantic! Love needs to be proven with actions, babe. Lek, please. Please fan the satays slowly. Why? Don't let the smoke from the satay block my view of this beautiful woman. You and your words. Thank you, babe, for wanting to visit my house again earlier. Yes, babe. It's really obvious that I haven't been there in a long time. Mom was really happy to see you. Hey! Farah! I'm also happy, babe, that I can finally get back with my choice. You made the right choice. Top, number one. No one can compare to me. Nonsense. You don't believe me. Cut my chest open, Far. Do I need to lend you a knife? Do you have a knife? "Selling satays is not like selling rujak, I don't use a knife." But for sure, Far, my heart is only for you. Of course. Gosh, babe, I will poke your eyes. Don't, babe. Okay, I want to say something serious. Please listen, okay? What? I will do better for you for myself and for our relationship in the future. Top. I will be ready to support your efforts. Seriously? Yes! Okay! - Babe. - What? Where's the satay? Oh, yeah. Lek, where's the satay? So long! You told me to slow down. You're eating them yourself? I'm buying those, don't eat them yourself! Which one, Yu? The text size of Gendis is already okay. - Jok! - Yes, sir. What's this? Oh, wait a second… Just make this one smaller, Jok. Yeah? Welcome to Chamas Brazilian Churrascaria. Cool. He'll have two slices. I'll ask if I want more! This tastes so good! - Is the size okay? - Yes, perfect. - It's not too small? - No. As long as my salary is not small. This looks okay, right? I'll add some finishing touches later. Looks good, cool, perfect! You've given it your all. Of course. Ready for the launch? Ready! Dude. You finally resigned. I have no friend now. I'm still here. Hello? - Hello, babe. - Hello, babe. You're back in the office? Yeah, I just went out to deliver a design. Have you eaten? Yes, I have. You don't forget to eat too. Yes, babe. Babe, I can't wait to come to the launching event of Gendis chocolate. Oh really? Yes, babe. So you can finish helping your friend, and focus with your work at the bank. What? The key witness in the case of embezzled funds for the procurement of street CCTV, Hasbi Rivaldi, was finally questioned. -His status as witness -Hasbi? -Has been changed to defendant -Farah's Hasbi? And is now being taken into custody. Joko must know. We have made some changes, there are new variants, design changes… Most importantly, there is a new management under the leadership of our beloved daughter, Ayu. Thank you so much. So cool! Yes, I designed all of them. What do you think? Good. They're cute! Wait… What is this? Is this an apple? How is it an apple? This is a love shape. I get why you're confused. Because this one is shaped upside down, look it's love. Oh, I see it now. Cute! Of course. Is that your friend that you're helping? Yes, I have told you last time. Why? You haven't introduced her to me. Yes, but she's currently still busy. When she's not busy later, I'll introduce you to her. We can take this home, right? Falling in love flavor… Dli, we can take it home? Yeah. Not bad. Are you going parachuting? You said we can take them home. But you can't take them all. - This is for my kid! - I also want! My kid loves chocolate! Don't act like you've never eaten chocolates! Return it! Return it! I don't really like chocolate. Take it! I can also afford it. Come on. - I'll buy them for you! - But you are poor. Now, this is my friend who I've been helping, Ayu. Yu, this is Farah, my girlfriend. - Ayu. - Farah. That guy who is on his phone is Ayu's boyfriend. His name is Alan. Hey, Alan! Oh, you already have a boyfriend too. Nice to meet you. Thank you for coming. Yes. Jok, can you come with me for a moment? - Where to? - There's a poster we need to check. It's okay. Babe, just stick with Ajeng first. Yes, babe. Just a minute. - Yes, it's fine. Go. - Okay. - Be with Ajeng. - Right. Which one? That one? I don't think there's a problem with the design. It's just printed like this. Actually, there is no problem, Yu. - There is, Jok. - Where? I haven't had time to ask you something about Farah. What about Farah? Has Farah told you the reason why she broke off her engagement with Hasbi? She decided to choose me. Why? What happened with her and Hasbi? Well, Yu, what happened between my ex and her ex is their problem. It's none of my business. Hasbi was arrested, Jok. For corruption. Did Farah really choose you out of love? Or is it because Hasbi is gone? Why are you telling me this, Yu? Sorry. Farah is not like that. The key witness in the case of embezzled funds for the procurement of street CCTV, Hasbi Rivaldi, was finally… Hello, bro. I think I have to extend. She's been cold to me lately, that's why I have to win her back. I can't lose her, man. You know she's my meal ticket, right? Accommodation is easy. You know how madly in love she is with me, right? This is the cool part. Ayu's father gave her his company to handle. I can get anything I want easily now. Love? To hell with love. I can't eat love, bro. It's a real world, man. What can I do with love, if I don't have any money? Get out! Wait, someone is inside. Get out! What's up with these villagers? Oh, it's you! I heard everything you said. What the hell are you talking about? What the hell, dog? You're just playing with Ayu? So what if I am? I am her friend! But Ayu is in love with me, dog. "Dog?" This is East Java, asshole! Go back to Jakarta, asshole! What did you do to Alan, Jok? I heard everything, Yu. He's just using you! If you're upset with me, don't lash it out at Alan! But, Yu… - Babe… - Wait, babe. - Babe… - Damn! He is lying, Yu, I swear! Just because Farah did that to you, you think Alan would do the same to me? Alan is not like that, asshole! - Babe… - It's okay, babe. - It hurts. - Calm down, Jok. Calm down. Why did you fight with Joko? - I don't know, he started it. - Why? He was talking about you and he suddenly hit me. He doesn't have a right! I think he likes you. Alan is an asshole who's just playing with Ayu. That's their relationship, we shouldn't get too involved. You're right. But why did she mention my name earlier? Oh, about that… It's… So… - Ayu… - What? Joko? What happened? Did you beat him? No, Dad, it's… I fell down earlier. It's okay. Give him something to compress with. For shame. How did it end up like this? Joko. - Yeah. - Farah told me everything. I know you got promoted at work. That means your salary is big, right? I'm happy. I can give Farah over to you to live together and live a good life. Not poor. - Far? - Yes, Dad. You took so long to get a compress. Here. Please take care of him. Don't waste it. His pay is already big. Okay? - Yes. - I'll go to the store now. - Yeah. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Take care, Dad. I know, if I fell down, I'll get up by myself. - Far. - Yeah? You saw my work earlier, right? What do you think, is it good? Yes. What if I quit to do design work, what do you think? Don't do it. It is an unstable job. It's better to be a becak driver. It's more stable. Here, babe. Wait, Far. I never asked you. Why did you break up with Hasbi? I chose you. Wait… You chose me again because Hasbi is gone, right? He's in jail now. Just so you know, Far… I have quit my bank job. I'm a full-time designer at Ayu's store now. How could you, Jok? So what happens to our plan? Your plan to marry me? What do I have to say to my father? Far. Before you think about your Father's answer, how about your own answer? Are you sincere enough to let me be a designer? Sincere or not? Far? Sincere or not, Far? Damn it. You, Far… I always prioritize you for everything. My number one. But it turns out, I'm just… A back up plan! Oh, God. Okay, Far. Goodbye. Damn it! Excuse me. - Is it okay I'm still cleaning? - Yes. - Babe? - Just a minute, babe. I'm in the shower. - I brought you some pastries and fruits. - Okay, babe, thank you. JOSH: YOU'RE RIGHT. LOVE DOESN'T MATTER. WHAT MATTERS IS MONEY. DID YOU DO IT WITH AYU LAST NIGHT? SINCE SHE IS RUNNING HER FATHER'S COMPANY, YOU SHOULD STICK WITH HER AND ENJOY HER MONEY. Mr. Sarjam! Mr. Bandi. - With who? - My wife. This is my wife. I'm happy it's crowded even though it is raining. Uncle Tono. There's a guest. - Okay, we'll go home now. Thank you. - Okay. There are some fruits from Mom and Dad for you. I don't want these plastic fruits. - Hello, Cak Tono. - Hello. You're late, you come when the show has just finished. I'm not here to watch. I want to collect your debt. - Collect my debt? - Yes. The borrower has forgotten, but the lender still remembers. You're complicated. - You have debt? - Deficit. - You owe me? - The other way. Why are you collecting? - I need the money. - People who borrow… Must pay back. - If I have. - If you don't have? Promise, four years. In your head. Salak glutinous rice tastes bitter, borrowing is easy, but collecting is complicated. Only two million, why such a fuss? - It's three million, not two! - I thought it's three million. Here. Mr. Tono, I'm sorry. I don't get it. How are you happy living like this? You're already old. There are many stable jobs out there. Jobs that could give you a better life. What are you looking for here? Ning, let me tell you. In life, there are two kinds of people. Some are concerned with making money, some are looking for satisfaction. What I seek is satisfaction. Even though I'm not rich, I don't have any expensive things, I am content with my life, Ning. LUDRUK SAPARI Look at Mr. Tono's life, making a living from his hobby. Isn't he miserable living like that? He shouldn't rely on his hobby. But he also said that hobbies are… I disagree! Honey, I hope you understand what he meant. What do you mean? To be honest, do you think I regret leaving ludruk? That's not true. I don't mind. I am sincere. I've decided to build a family with you because I love you. I did everything I've wanted to do. You're weird. You want me to understand, but your choice is the opposite. - What are you saying? - Hey! You should listen, your son wants to talk. Go on, son. Speak. Even though Dad and Mr. Tono are longtime close friends, they have different wants. I am the son of you and Dad, but all of us have different wants. Of course. Yes. There is no correct way to live, Mom. I know. I understand. But as a mother, all I want is for my child to live a good life, and be successful! Now, do you want your son to be successful, but he feels depressed? Honestly, Mom… I can't live anymore if I don't follow my passion. You know how much… I want to be a designer, Mom. I really do. Are you sure you can succeed from your passion? Yes, I have thought about it seriously. I'm just looking for your blessing now. Because you are my birth mother. Nothing will happen without your blessing. That's it, Mom. Gosh. Okay. Okay what, Mom? Okay. It seems that I'm wrong. All this time, what I wanted would have made you feel depressed. I give you my blessing, my support. But you have to promise! You will take full responsibility, meaning you have to be able to succeed from your talent! Be careful, because if you don't succeed, I will deep fry you like a beancurd! I promise I will be successful. Okay, son, go after what makes you happy. Dad. Now that your mother has approved, finish your food quickly! Yes, I will definitely finish this. - Finish the spoon too. - What? You think he's a seahorse? You're being weird, Dad. IGOR'S FINE PASTRY DE BUN - Hello, Jok. - Hello. Miss, please send this… This is order from Brunei Darussalam. - Kabir. - Jok. Looks like “Your Ex's Tears” is the best seller? Thank God, Jok. There were a lot of strange requests. Starting with the flavors of ex's tears from falling, stumbling, and the most extreme, the flavor of ex's tears from being crushed. I still keep his ID card. You and your jokes. - You're from the office? - Yes. Are you looking for a place to live in? Why are you looking around like that? Of course not. Ayu has not come yet? She's usually here. She didn't tell you? Tell me what? Yesterday, Mr. Fred and Mrs. Nadia told me… They are going back to Germany today. They are going back to Germany today? The other day, I was tasked with handling everything here from now on. I think they'll register me on their family certificate. I will be adopted. Looks like they're going to stay there for a while. You should call and say goodbye. Is Germany far away, Mom? Why? I miss Ayu, Mom. You have to let her go. You don't have to be sad, you don't have to cry. Who knows, maybe you'll seeAyu again one day. Jok, if you are sure with your decision, my advice is… Just do it. I will totally support you. Do you understand, Jok? It's not because you can't express what's on your mind, but because you don't know what you want for yourself. Now, what do you want, Jok? Want to marry my daughter? How much is your salary? How can you even make a living from just being able to draw? Resign from here? You will be poor! When are you getting married, Jok? To hell with you all! DEAD - Yu. - Jok. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - I'm the one who should apologize. - I'm the one who should apologize. Okay, you first. I broke up with Farah, Yu. I admit that all this time, I have never listened to my heart. I'm always in the position of doing things that I don't want. Just because it's what everyone around me wants. If you only knew how miserable I felt! But that was before you came, Yu. When you came back in my life… It feels as if you are hope, Yu. Jok… Yes, I'm sorry. I'm out of line saying this because you are still with Alan. But please listen first. This is what's inside my heart, Yu. I am a fool. I am not a decisive person. You are the only one who supported me. When it feels like the whole world is stepping on me… If you must know, Yu, you were my first heartbreak. You are also my first love, Yu. And now I have to lose you again. I swear I can't let you go. I swear. But the way my life has been arranged by God, even though after this, I may never see you again. I… I… I love you, Yu. Please don't leave my life. I will help you take care of Gendis chocolate. You don't have to pay me. I don't want you to leave my life again, Yu. Calm down. There, there. Stop being sad. Life has many obstacles, Jok. I swear, you're so ugly when you cry, Jok! I already broke up with Alan. He was just using me. Jok, if I'm being honest, I also didn't think that after we meet again, my point of view would change so much. One thing I like about you, is that you are who you are. All this time, I always felt blinded by love. But when I'm with you, I feel like there's a greater kind of love. Love as it is. Until I can't lie to my own heart, that I also… I also love you, Jok. But you're leaving my life… I'm not going anywhere, Jok. I'm staying here. Only my parents are going back to Germany. You're not going with them? Damn Kabir's mouth! So you love me? Jok, behave! I know your father. I can tell him to remove you from the family certificate! No, sir, this is not… Calm down, Jok. How can I not allow it when this has obviously been arranged by God. Yes. But, control yourselves! Wait until marriage. Mom, what are you talking about? Well, Ayu. - Bye. - Bye, Dad. I love you. - Mom. - My girl. Don't forget what we told you. - Okay? - Yeah. Okay, my girl. Jok, don't forget. Family certificate! Got it, Uncle! - Hand, Uncle. - Yeah. - Take care, Uncle, Aunty. - Yeah. - Okay. - Bye! - Bye! - Bye! - Take care, Uncle, Aunty. - Bye, Mom, Dad. People love Gendis merchandise a lot. Some people just want to buy the merchandise. But I don't want to separate it from the chocolate. What if we separate instead? Seriously? We only started dating for two months, you want to separate? That's not what I mean. What if you open your own branding design agency? The second floor office is still empty. Seriously, can I? I'm sure you can do it. I'm sure I can! Hi, guys, today I got a special shipment from Surabaya, the brand is Gendis chocolate. Gendis chocolate is legendary in Surabaya. Look, guys, the flavor names sound unique. Like this one. "The flavor of being happy with a new special someone." It's so good, Yu! I'm such an idiot for wasting you. This is really good. Alan! Don't you have a brain? Doing item reviews? Pay your rent for the last three months! - Yes, Ma'am. - You keep on saying that! It's live streaming? I'm such an idiot. I am so dead.
