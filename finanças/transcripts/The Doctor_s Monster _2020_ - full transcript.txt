- You must find a cure soon father. I don't have much time. - I will, Brooklyn. - And I'm scared. - No need to be scared, honey, I'm here for you. - Am I going to die? - No. - How do you know? - Because I know. I have a good feeling about your prognosis. - I'm scared. - Shh. Don't talk, you need some rest, Brooklyn. - Please, don't let me die. - I will die before I let your die, please understand that. - I know. - Okay, get some rest, okay? - But father? - Yes, Brooklyn? - Richard, has he contacted you? - I haven't heard from him. - You wouldn't lie? - There's more important things to worry about right now, okay? Get some rest. My dear Marian, I miss you so much. I can't afford to lose a daughter too. I won't. I won't, I promise. Is everything ready for the experiment? - Yes, we're just about ready doctor. - All right, 30 ccs of the formula. Boris, is the electricity ready? - Yes, doctor. - Lydia, please put the electrodes on. Boris, slowly go up to 15 amps. Good. Lydia, do you detect a heartbeat? - Not yet, doctor. - Why hasn't anything happened yet? Boris, go up to 20 amps. - But doctor, the organs can't handle that much. - Boris, please do as I say. - Yes. It works. - My God, it finally worked, doctor. My God. - Yes, I see. - My God. - I'm so sorry, doctor. - I'm so sorry. - No, no! No! I must try again, but this time on a bigger subject. - Okay. - Bigger? - Yes, Boris, a small dog just can't take the stress these experiments put on their body. I need a human body. - A human? Do you hear what you're saying? - Yes Boris, but my daughter is going to die, okay? I am not gonna just sit by and do nothing. I know if I can get this right I can bring her back and give her life again! The life that she doesn't deserve to lose at such a young age. Plus, I promised I would do anything I can to help her, and that's exactly what I'm going to do. - Yes, but doctor, don't you understand those are consequences? We're talking about a human being here, not a dog! - Yes doctor, I must agree. Remember all the strange animal experiments? It's how are you lost your license to operate in animal hospitals. I can't imagine what is gonna happen if the authorities find out that you experiment on human bodies. - Why can't you see if I can succeed at bringing a human being back to life, this will be the greatest scientific accomplishment in the history of mankind? I would be the greatest doctor that ever lived! Not to mention I'll get my precious daughter back. So the mere thought of my success is worth far more than any consequence I can think of. Anyways, I want you two to find me a freshly diseased body immediately. Time is of the essence. Okay? - But how are we supposed to? - I don't care how you get me body. Just do it! - Boris. Boris. Boris! Are you seriously gonna help Dr. Monster do this? - Yes, I am, Lydia. I owe my life to Dr. Monster. He gave me a job in his laboratory when I had nothing, and no one who believed in me. I'm not going to turn my back on him now, and neither should you. - Yes, but what... - But what, Lydia? If you walk away now what are you going to do? Where you going to go? With the reputation Dr. Monster has, do you really believe that anyone would hire one of his longtime assistants? I don't think so. - I guess you're right. - Yeah. - And Dr. Monster has helped me so much, I would hate to turn my back on him now. - Look at it this way, if he actually pulls that off, you and I will become famous as his longtime assistants who helped creating the biggest medical breakthrough that the world has ever known. - I guess you do have a point. Well, if we're gonna do this, let's do it. Find anything interesting? - Yes, I think so. It looks like a man had committed suicide last night. And he's in perfect health. And he's gonna be buried tomorrow at a cemetery not too far from here. - It's perfect. - You think so? - Yeah. I don't see why not. It's a fresh body, not much trauma, that's what he wants, right? - Yeah, maybe you're right. Boris, Boris, what are you doing here? Security could come. No Boris, no, you're right, right. - Set him over there. - He's so heavy, doctor. - Yeah, no kidding. - He's heavy. - Perfect, tomorrow we shall begin the experiment. Everything is going to be okay now, Brooklyn. It's only a matter of time. I promised I would do anything I can to help you. And that's what I'm going to do. - Doctor, we're ready for you. - Coming. What's wrong? - Nothing, doctor. - Where is Lydia? - She's coming in a second. - Listen, Boris, we've been over the procedure 1,000 times. We've practiced on enough animals, it's time to bring a human being back to life. Get ready. - Okay, let's do this for Brooklyn. Doc, it's Richard. What do we do? - Okay, let me handle this, okay? - Okay. - What are you doing here? - I came here for Brooklyn, how's she doing? - Now is not a good time. - Why not, is it Brooklyn? - Because I said so, Brooklyn is sleeping, and I'm working right now. - Look, I came here for Brooklyn and not you. I need to see her. - I said, no! - Look man, all I'm asking for is a little bit of her time, I need to see her, and I need to know if she's okay! - Look, I told you she's sleeping, she doesn't wanna see anyone right now, you need to leave, okay? - I know she wants to see me. Whatever differences me and you have, is between me and you. - Well, leave her out of this. - But don't put your daughter in the middle of the this! - Leave her out of this. - Why? - She doesn't wanna see you! Okay? Now go! - Is everything okay doctor? - Everything is fine, let's begin the experiment. - Nothing. - Right there. It is time. - I hope this works. - I think it will. - 50 ccs of the formula. - Yes, doctor. Did it work? - Give it a moment. - It worked! - It's alive. - What? My God. - It worked. - Congratulations, doctor. - Yes, congratulations. - Okay, now we gotta keep him alive. Lydia, start the IV. Boris, slowly turn down the electricity and disconnect the electrodes. Okay, step back, step back. Okay, I got it. Step aside. - He looks amazing, absolutely amazing. - His heart is beating quite well. Okay, it's okay my friend, it's okay. Okay, you're gonna be fine. - He looks weak, doctor. - I mean, that's to be expected. His body's going to take a little time to recover from the shock that just happened. It's okay. - Imagine the possibilities, doctor. We could make millions, possibly even billions. Do you know how many families will pay to get their lovely ones back from the dead? - Boris, no one must know just yet, no one! Not until I'm sure this will work on Brooklyn first, understood? - Okay. - Yes, doctor. - Sorry, doctor. - Get a chair, grab a chair. You're okay my friend, you're in good hands. Yeah, it's okay, you're gonna be okay. - Maybe he's hungry, doctor. - Hungry, do you think he even knows how to eat or drink? - Okay, Lydia, you wanna please grab a plate of food and a glass of water, okay? - Yes, doctor. - Boris, check his vital signs to see how he's doing. - All his vital signs look normal, doctor. - Excellent, he's functioning better than expected. - Here's the food, doctor. - Excellent, bring it here. Okay, we'll feed him. - He's like sniffing me, what should I do? Okay, good, he must have been starving. - My God. - Amazing, he has excellent hand to eye coordination. - His hand to mouth coordination seems to be fine as well. - Let me give him some water. Aye, aye, aye, okay. Okay. Okay, you will get the hang of it, don't worry. But who would have thought coming back from the dead would give you such an appetite? Well remember, before he was buried all of his fluid and stomach contents were removed. The blood transfusion we gave him replenished his blood, but his body was still depleted of food and water. This is all extremely normal. - Do you think he's done? - Yeah, I think that's enough for today. I don't wanna give too much. Let's let his new body digest this food. Boris. - He looks at me like he wants to kill me, doctor. - Boris, come, come on, he's completely harmless. - Are you sure? I mean... - Yes, I mean, I wanna see how well he can walk around his own. Boris, help me out. - Doctor, do you think that's a wise decision? - Are you sure that's safe? - Yes, come on. Look at him, he's completely harmless, he's fine. Yes, my friend. - It's amazing. - Sure, it's amazing but, I think it's enough excitement for tonight. Boris, sit him back in there. And Lydia, please administer max sedative so he sleeps overnight, okay? - Okay. - Come on buddy, come on back. - Here you go. - I got it. - To me? - Okay, I'll do it. Okay, all right. Set him back there, okay? - I got you buddy, I got you. - You got him? - I got him, sit back in there my friend, okay? Doctor! - I got it. You're good. It's okay, it's okay, you're okay, all right. You're all right, you're all right. Now you can walk around on your own, okay? All right, you need to train a little bit, you need to exercise. I'm going to show you around, so, this is the storage area where we actually store the supplies for the hospital. So you can come down here anytime, walk, you know, a little bit of exercise. It's good for you. That's another room where also store, watch your head, also store things. And this is the boiler room. Watch your head. That's where we keep the place warm, the entire hospital. See? All right, so now I want you to see the Sun. Nice and warm. Okay, come with me. Okay, watch your head. Yes, this is the Sun, you see, the light. Okay, Monster? It's nice? You see those here, they're called hills. Come here, let me show you. You see the green stuff here? That's the grass. Okay? It's nice? Yes. And, you see those bigger hills there? Big stuff, it's mountains. They're called mountains. Mountains. See? Okay, let's go back, Monster. Let's go back inside, okay? We'll come back tomorrow, a little bit every day. Okay? Okay, Monster? It's nice? Outdoors. Okay, watch your head. Be strong pumpkin, be strong. Please hang in there for me, okay? - Brook lyn. - You can speak. - Brooklyn. Brook lyn. - She's sick right now, okay? But I will bring her back just like I brought you back. So you better come with me. Boris! - Yes, doctor? - Boris, I want you to take Monster back to the lab. - By myself? - Yes, by yourself. Is there a problem? - No, Doctor. - All right, then do it. Here. Take this lighter, I want you to light pilot in the furnace, this place is freezing. It's really bad for Brooklyn, okay? I was already there myself when I stopped to check on Brooklyn, come on. - Come on, big fella. Whoa. Relax, relax. Doctor, doctor, doctor! - What, what's going on? - He ran away. - What do you mean, "He ran away?" - I don't know, I was just lighting the lighter to test it and he was starting to freak out. - Where is he? - He just ran that way. - God. - I'm so sorry. - We need to find him immediately! Hurry, check over there. Lydia, over there! My God, my God. - Monster. - Brook, Brook. Brook. - Did you find him? - I haven't found him yet, doctor. - God, Boris. - I'm sorry. - I feel like a failure, Boris. - Don't feel like that doctor, it's not too late. - I promised her, do you understand that? I promised her I wouldn't let her die. - She knows you're doing your best, doctor. Don't be so hard on yourself. - Well, I said the same thing when my wife passed away. - You can't save everybody doctor, you're just one person. - Only one person was made a promise, Boris. A promise that was to my daughter. - Why do you sound like you're giving up already? - I don't know. - Don't give up, doctor, she's counting on you. You still have that one chance. You owe her at least that. - Well, hopefully we'll find Monster soon. - Yeah. - Okay, in the meantime I have to prep the lab for Brooklyn's procedure. She's still alive but she doesn't have much time. - Brook lyn. Brook lyn. Brook lyn. - My God. What's going on? - I don't know. - That's Brooklyn's bedspread. Brooklyn? What's going on here, where is she? - I don't know. - Monster took her! - Brooklyn? Why would he do that? - I don't know, but it seems that he has formed some sort of attraction for her. - But we need to find him before someone else does. - I agree. We need to call someone we can trust for help. - But, like who? - Richard, Richard will help us. - A police officer? We can't get the police involved, we can't call those people. - We need to call Richard, not as a police officer, but as Brooklyn's boyfriend. He cares deeply for her and he will want to do anything we need to help us. - I mean, just as long as we make sure that he's not bringing the police around, I think we're gonna be fine. - I'm going to convince him not to get the authorities involved. - Okay. - Hello? - Hello Richard, this is Dr. Monster, Brooklyn's father. - Yes, has something happened to Brooklyn? - I need you to come to the hospital right away. - I need your help with something, Richard. I'll explain everything when you get here. - Fine, but I want to see her this time. - No problem, Richard. - All right, I'm on my way. All right, what's going on? - Please come in, Richard. Boris, please excuse us. - Where is she? - Richard, Richard, please. Please, Richard. - All right, what's going on? First, you hate my guts, and you don't want me to see Brooklyn. And now you're all nice to me, and wanted me to come over. - I know this is strange for you. - You're damn right it is, now answer me. Where is Brooklyn? - First, you need to promise me something. - What? - What I'm about to tell you may sound unbelievable to you. But I have no choice right now, and I need your help, Richard. You need my help? And why should I help you? - Because Brooklyn's life depends on it. - I'm listening. - Well, first you need to promise me you won't say anything to anyone. - You're wasting my time, just spit it out. - Promise me, Richard! - Fine, I promise, I won't say a word to anybody about this. - Very well then. - This better be good. - I'll start from the beginning. As you know Brooklyn's been very sick. Her mom died from the same disease that Brooklyn is actually suffering from. - Yes, I knew that. - And in desperate attempt to preserve her life, I was willing to try anything, I mean, anything to save her! It first started with plants. At first, I thought I found a way to bring dead things back to life. But, I was wrong. At least for that moment. So, I thought, maybe I should take it to the next level. Maybe I should try my experiment on a dead animal, so I did. But again, the dog was only a partial success because it only came back to life momentarily. But this time Brooklyn was so close to death that I became desperate. I knew had to step up my experiment to a human being. - A human being? Don't tell me you tried this witchcraft on Brooklyn! - No, I didn't, Richard. My plan was never to save her from dying, but to bring her back from the death, two different things. - Okay, now this is getting weird. Monster, what did you do? - I did what I had to do to help my daughter. So I had Boris get a freshly deceased body to try my experiment on. - You did what? - Richard, please, please, you promised you'd help me. - Yeah, but. - I know this sounds disturbing, but it was the only way. - You gotta be kidding me. - Wait, let me finish. Would you please let me finish! - You got to. - Remember when you came by last night? There's a reason why I didn't let you come in. I was in the middle of doing my final experiment, the one that would determine if Brooklyn would live or die. I had my assistant bring a dead body into the lab that night. We tried the experiment on the body hoping it would work. And when I hit that button my heart was racing. This was the moment I was waiting for. And when it was all over, I waited, my assistants were there. We all waited to see if it worked. And it did. It was my biggest accomplishment. But now my creation has kidnapped Brooklyn, and now, I have to find them to get her back. - Wait a minute, are you telling me this monster you created took Brooklyn? - Yes! But it's not a monster, okay, it's actually quite gentle. - What? Gentle? I can't believe this man. You are insane. - But it's true. Well, not the insane part. - And how do you expect for me to believe all this? - Richard, I wouldn't lie when it comes to my daughter's life. You know that. - Okay, okay, okay, all right. So, say you're telling me the truth about this monster, what do you want me to do? - I need your help in finding them. But you can't get the police involved, because they will kill Monster, put us all away, taking away any chance of saving Brooklyn. - Why, why? Why would you do such a thing? A human being! Who are you to mess with human nature like that? Do you know how crazy this is? - I did it for Brooklyn. - Why, so you can make her monster too? - Don't say that, Richard. - She's your daughter, and not a monster. She's not one of your science experiments. - Look, what's done is done. Okay? Brooklyn is all I have, she's my only daughter, Richard. I already lost my wife, I can't afford to lose my daughter too. - All right, all right, I'll help you find this thing. - There isn't a thing, it's Monster! - Whatever, I'll help you find this monster, and bring back Brooklyn, so you can help her. But look, I'm doing this for Brooklyn, and not you. - Listen, I understand, we still have our differences to work out, Richard. But we gotta put this aside for Brooklyn's sake. - All right, yeah, I agree. So look, here's the plan. I need one of your assistant's to come with me to help find Brooklyn. You and your other assistant can stay here just in case they come back. - Okay. - All right! - Brook lyn. Brook lyn. Brook lyn. Brook lyn. Brook. Brook. - It shouldn't be too hard to find a 6'10 monster. - I hope not. - Let's just hope it's not too late. - What makes you say that? - I mean, the monster could be capable of anything. - This monster, I still can't believe we're looking for a monster. I'll believe it when I see it. - Yeah, "The proof is in the pudding," it's what they say, right? - Yeah, I guess you could say that. So you know your way around these woods pretty well? - Yeah, sure, no problem, why? - I just wanna make sure we don't get lost. - Don't worry, I'm like a map around here, I got us covered. - That's good to know. Are you sure there's no snakes around here? - There shouldn't be. - What do you mean there shouldn't be? - I don't know, there shouldn't be. - Great. - No lions, no tigers, no bears either. - Now is not the time for jokes. - I'm sorry. Who are you telling? I don't like creeping around in these woods. - I just wanna find Brooklyn and get this ordeal over with. - I definitely agree on that. - Yeah. Awe, man, I'm getting tired. - So am I. I hope we're gonna find them soon. - What's wrong? - I have to take a leak. - Are you kidding me? How can you think about taking a leak right now? - When you have to go you have to go. - Brook lyn. Brook lyn. - Hey, what you doing there? That's my sandwich, put it down. - Put it down. - Put down the sandwich. Put down the sandwich. Put down the sandwich. Who are you? What the hell are you doing? Get out. Get out of here. - Brooklyn, she's still alive, she's still alive! - Monster, it's okay, calm down. It's me, remember me? It's Boris, it's your old friend Monster. No, calm down, calm down, down. You okay? - I'm fine, just help me bring her back home. - Okay, no problem. - I can't believe you were telling the truth. Do you realize what you've done? What you both have done? You created something that could be a danger to anyone it confronts! - Okay, let's just be glad Brooklyn is back and safe, yes? - Yes, I'm glad, believe me. But what you've done, completely unacceptable. - But we can't worry about that right now, Richard. What matters right now, besides Brooklyn, is finding Monster and bringing him back to the lab before he makes his way into the city. So, you and Boris go find him, and I gotta stay here and take care of Brooklyn. - Are you crazy? That thing is dangerous! It grabbed me by my throat and nearly choked me to death! - I understand how you feel, Richard, I do. But I gotta stay here and take care of Brooklyn. - You listen to me very carefully, I'm never leaving Brooklyn's side again. Especially with that monster thing, or whatever you created is still out there. Look, I know I promised you I wouldn't say anything to anybody, but this is getting out of control. We need to involve the police force. - Richard, no, I understand how you feel Richard, but if you do this you will surely condemn her to death and we will all lose her forever. Richard, if you love her the way you say you do, please let me care for her. Okay, I understand you don't want to leave her, but I can do more for her right now than you can. Okay, Richard? - Richard, please let the doctor take care of Brooklyn. I need your help to track down the monster. - Please, Richard. Go now. - Okay. - I gotta take you to the lab now. - What was what was that? Did you hear that? - Sure did. Babe. - I heard it again. - Go check outside. Babe, please be careful. - I will. - Go ahead. Don't be gone long. - I won't. Stay back! Back up! Back up! - Gene? Hey, are you lost? I'm actually looking for my husband, Gene. No, no, no, no, no, no. Hollywood and Cherokee. And also call back and find out where the victim is. Come out, have 'em try and find out where the victim or suspect is. - 6030, there is no call backs. - Stone. Carter, what happened? - Well, it looks like there's a killer on the loose. This lady's husband was killed by some guy that she said was moaning loudly or something like that. We're still trying to get all the detail from her. - Yeah, she was pretty freaked out, still pretty out of it. - Did she mention anything other than that? - Well, she was cooking dinner when they both heard some weird noises and a bump outside the house, so, the husband comes out to investigate and gets killed by some guy. - Did she give a description of the suspect? - No actually, all happened too fast. Funny? - Interesting. - Have you been assigned to the case? - No, I just stopped by when I saw police activity. - Hey, is that the guy that works for your girlfriend's father, that old doctor? - Yeah, we're just running and errand for the doctor. Well, I better get going. - All right then, Richard. - Yeah, good luck. - Yeah, thanks, think we're gonna need it on this one. - Dude, the skateboard crew are gonna love this spot. - Hell yeah. Hey man, this place is sick. All we need is some sick graffiti, give it some style. - Get that thing on there. - Bow. - Bow, what? - All right, check this out. - Who is this crazy looking fool? - Hey partner, you better mind your business, dog. - Yeah, you better kick rocks why you still can, fool. Is this is fools sick or something? Look like some sorta bad science experiment. - Aye, hold up, I got this. Aye bro, you better shake this spot before you get dealt with, all right? - Brook lyn. - What the fuck he just say? - I don't know. - Brook lyn. - Yo, I don't speak jibber jabber, homie. Is this fool moaning? - What you moaning for dog, you hurt or something? - Yo, hurry up and handle this fool, we gotta shake this spot before the cops come. - I warned your punk ass. - Yo, what the fuck, dog? You want some of this? - We gotta hurry up and find him before he hurts someone else. - I know, I'm trying my best. - Brooklyn. Brooklyn. Brooklyn. Brooklyn. - I think we need to split up. - Yeah, maybe you're right. But what if I see him? - Call me right away. - Call you? - Yes, you do have your cell phone on you? - No, I don't have a cell phone. - What, you don't have a cell phone? - No. Why? - Listen to me, if you find him call me on the nearest payphone that you find. - Call you. - Yes, you do have a quarter on you to make that call, right? - No. - Jesus. Here's my card. - Okay. - And a quarter. Just call me. - Okay. Thank you. - Brook lyn. - My God, are you okay, what happened to you? Have you come to the church for help. - Brooklyn. - What? - Brooklyn. - Hey, let me go! - Brooklyn. Brooklyn! - I don't know what you're talking about, my name's not Brooklyn! Let me go! - What's up Manny? - Shit, what's up Erica? - Is my car ready Emanuel? - Not yet, I'm working on it. - Come on, you told me you'd have it ready in a couple hours when I talked to you earlier. - Yeah, I know, what do you want me to do? I got three other cars I was working on, I'm doing my best. - This is some bull. - Relax, I'll have it ready for you by tomorrow morning. - Dude, I need my car right now. I have work tonight and tomorrow morning. I won't even have time to pick it up. - Look, you've been a longtime customer. Just pick it up after work, I'll even wash it for you. And, if you have more car troubles in the future the next repairs are on me. We good? - Whatever, Emanuel. - Come on, don't be like that. Your car's gonna run so smooth, you won't even recognize me in it. I'll be with you just one second, sir. - Emanuel, I think you should see what's up with this dude. - Can I help you? - Emanuel, I wouldn't get too close to him. - You okay? I think he's hurt. Awe, man. Come on over here, come sit down, come sit down. Over here, here, come here. Come here. Come on, it's okay, it's okay, I'm not gonna hurt you. Come here. Come over here, sit down. Sit down, it's okay. It's okay. Are you gonna help him? I mean, isn't this your job? You could treat him better than I can. - Manny, get away from him. - Brooklyn. - What'd he say? - Brooklyn. Brooklyn. - Hey, easy, easy, easy. I mean, you're lucky, she can help you. Isn't this your job? She can help, it's okay, relax. This guy is messed up. It looks like he had some kinda crazy surgeries or something. It's insane. Are you gonna help him, you gonna do anything? I mean, look at him, I haven't seen this before. This is, Jesus. - Brooklyn! - Wait, wait! - This is Detective Richard Gatz, what? - Richard, I heard Monster yelling, I think he's close. - Where are you? - Just on Main Street by the mechanic shop. - I'm close by, I'll be right there! - Monster, Monster, stop. Monster, stop. - Emanuel, do something. - Dammit, Boris. This is Detective Gatz with the Riverside Police Department. This man you just shot is a criminal on the run. - Look, I don't know what's going on, but this crazy fuck just tried to kill me. And he killed him when he tried to help me. - I know, I know, everything is under control. But I still need your help loading him into the car. - What? - Look, this man is part of an important case. I need to get to the hospital immediately. I can't just wait for an ambulance right now, come on! - Man, this is crazy. - Come on! - Hey, what about this other guy? - Don't worry, backup is on its way. - Manny, I want a refund. - Hi, my name is Detective Stone, I'm with the Homicide Division. Can you two tell me what happened here? - Where do you want me to start? - Well, how about from the top? Who owns this place? - I do. And some crazy big guy came in there and tried to kill me, so I shot him. - I see, but how are you involved? - I was in there talking to Manny, and then the guy came in and attacked him. - Can you describe this guy? - He was tall, black, had lots of tubes in his body. And he had some sort of prosthetic eye. - Did you see where he went? - Yeah, some cop took him. - Really? Any idea what this cop looked like? - I don't know. Average height, black, he had a black sedan. - Okay, did the officers do a report with you? - Yeah, they told us to stay here. - Okay, well, thank you for your cooperation. We need to track Richard Gatz. He just told me that he shot the guy that killed our victim in there, Richard Gatz pulls up, puts him in his car, and drives off. - Yeah, you know he looked familiar, wasn't he with Gatz earlier? - Yeah, so now he's dead, and Gatz drives off with a shot-up psycho? - Yeah, you think you took him to the hospital? - Possible, but, I think we start with Dr. Monster first. Something tells me he has something to do with this. - Yeah, you know what? I'll call the local hospital, see if any a gunshot victim showed up today. - Okay, but I don't think that's the hospital they went to. - Let's check it out. - Monster, hey, help me with this thing now! - My God, what happened to him? - He's been shot. This thing has killed many people, Monster. - Get him inside the lab, we don't have much time. - Jesus! - Lydia, we need to prepare for the resurrection of Brooklyn, quick! - What, is Brooklyn in there? - Don't touch her! - Brooklyn? - She's gonna be okay. - What, she's dead? - Not for long. - No! - Okay, it's the only way, Richard! - She's not another science experiment, this is your daughter we're talking about. - I know, which is why I have to do this. - If you do this you'll be creating another monster! It won't be Brooklyn anymore! - That's a chance I have to take, Richard. - You're sick, this is crazy! - She's all I have, she's my only daughter, Richard. I gotta do this! - It's the wrong thing to do. - I'm going to proceed with this and nobody's going to stop me, okay? Lydia, hurry up. - You did it. - What have you done to her? I told you you'd make another monster. - Hey, leave him alone, don't come any closer. - Lydia, get out of my way! - No, Richard, get back. - Brook lyn. - Are you okay, doctor? - I'm okay, Lydia. - Freeze! That goes for you too Richard. - Stone, are you serious? I'm one of you guys. - This is a whole nother ball game partner, put your hands in the air! - Are you kidding me? - Put 'em up! Hey. - Shit! - Brooklyn! Brooklyn. - Hey, keep an eye on him. - Yeah. - It's okay, nobody's gonna hurt you. Please, stop right there and put your hands up. If you come any closer I'll shoot. - Why, why did you do all this? - All I wanted to do is save my daughter's life. - You do realize innocent people died because of you? - Yes, well, I don't know what to say. - Take him away. - Hey. - God. - Can I get one last picture? - Yeah. Hold your breath. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hey Charlie, hey, what's up with you brother? It's Larry. Dude, wait until you hear this one, man. This is really fucked up. - Hey Larry, I'm gonna pull the van around so we can load up these two bodies and get the hell outta here. - Yes, please, the hell outta here. - Hey, Charlie, you there? Okay, dude, I've got a double dead body. Yeah, you heard me right, a double dead body. All right, you sitting down? 'Cause you're gonna need to. This girl, she died twice. Yeah, no, I know it's not possible. I didn't think it was possible, all right? But here I am, I'm standing over a girl that died twice, so. You want to hear the story or not? Okay, thank you, jackass. Dude, so, I guess this girl's father was some creepy fringe Frankenstein motherfucker and, she dies, he brings her back to life. And now she's dead again, and she's here. Yeah, I know, it sounds like some crazy sci-fi horror script, right? Yeah, I'll write the screenplay, you get the money together, we'll make the movie and then I can finally quit this bullshit dead-end job, cool? Yeah, all right, all right. Yeah, I'll talk to you later.
