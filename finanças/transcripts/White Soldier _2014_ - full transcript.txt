Late 1945, France sent to Indochina a task force composed of young soldiers. Their mission: to restore France's power over the Vietnamese "looters" and Japanese soldiers, despite Japan's capitulation. The soldiers will discover the reality of the rebellion lead by Ho chi Minh. This story is freely based on true events. THE WHITE SOLDIER Gentlemen, the Sten! A British weapon. Pure trash, a piece of garbage! Meaning we are fucked! Lousy precision. Range: 80 meters at best. Whatever you do, don't fill the charger to the brim or the thing will get blocked. If it still gets blocked, do not panic. Take the charger out. To remove the bullet: arm, disarm. If it doesn't work, hit it until the bullet comes out. The chinks will scare the shit out of you! When you face them, we'll see what you've got in your pants and what your hands are made of. What we teach you here, you have to stick it in your head if you don't want to end up hanging by your balls on a coconut tree. And remember: "Death "before shame". Understood? Yes, chief. Move it, move it! Goal! Goal! Where did the team spirit go? You're not alone. Damn, you're not alone. Look up. They're losing their cool! It's just a game, guys. I'm sorry, colonel. I didn't see you. It's okay. At ease. - Is everything alright? - It's all good. I'm Sergeant... Sergeant Cariou. 3rd battalion, 4th company. What is the morale like? Is it high? Yes, very. They want to rip into the Japs, beat the crap out of them. - Did you fight against the Germans? - Sadly, no. I've only been training for two months. I'm a rookie. They needed non-come, so I was promoted. If you need people on the frontline, I'm here. That's good, Cariou. Keep it up. We need guys like you. You have to shoot the targets. See the Japs? You won't see them anymore. Right on the head. Hey, girls! The pearls of the East! Come with us! - Come closer. - How much? - Will this do it? - Do you have opium? Alcohol? - Do you have alcohol? - Give me that bottle. How much is it? To my first casualty. Look. Japs. Many of them are still supporting the looters. What are they doing? Why are they here? Look down, my friend. You've lost this war. I heard the Japs cut heads, hands and feet off with their sabers. They don't take prisoners. It's a disgrace. - Ah! - Fuck! We're rotting in here. Where the hell is the general staff? Who are those? A pack of monkeys. What's that gibberish? Long live Ho chi Minh! French go home! There's no problem. It's alright. Long live the Revolution! Robert... I heard you were in the Resistance. You must have killed some Krauts... Actually... What does it feel like to kill? Seriously, even if it's a goddamn Heinie, it must be weird to kill a man. The thing is, Heinies are not men. But don't worry, you'll see it for yourself. My Tho, Mekong Delta February, 1946 Listen to me. It's a hostile area. We'll take no risks. We'll go straight to the jungle. Tual, to the right. Cariou, to the left. Liognier, you stay with me. Guys, just shoot ahead. It's useless to aim. You won't see them. - Is that clear? - Yes, Sergeant! Sergeant Cariou, that beach is ours. I bet you that my boys will get there first. We can do this. The Japs will take it right in the face. Want to eat some rice? Yeah! Come on! Let's go! Forward march! Straight to the border. Get down! Bastards! Take his gun, goddammit! Take his gun. Take his gun now! Cariou, take his gun. Take his gun. Move, move! Get down, Sergeant! Deploy! We watch and we deploy along the river. Where the hell are they? There are boats. They're gone. They've withdrawn. They're in that damn jungle. They shoot us and then run off like rabbits. Hey... Don't ever drop your men. You're a goddamn sergeant. There are not 10 soldiers. We're just one soldier. One freaking asshole running under a hail of bullets. They're hiding in their jungle. We'll find them. We'll make them pay. Lieutenant! Quoc! The Japanese didn't shoot us. They're 6 km away, in a village, ready to be disarmed. Come on, let's go. Come on, come on. We're watching! Go! Everybody to the right. - What is it? - Japs. Are they hurt or what? Drop your weapon. Drop it. Drop your weapon. Who's the chief? Come with me, Quoc. Drop your weapon. Drop it now. You, drop your gun. What are they doing here? A ship was supposed to take them back to Japan, but it didn't come. The officer says they want to go home. He also wants his men to be treated well. Tell him France is always kind to its prisoners. We're not barbarians. What is he doing? Watch the others! Michelet, take the weapons. Radio, with me. You have to go out. I'm going to do a little search. Come on, let's go. Come on, madam. You have to go with the others. Madam! Come on, you have to leave. Come on. He says we're their saviors. They don't have much apart from rice and seeds. He says we have to kill the Japanese like pigs and that he can do it. Alright. How old is he? He doesn't remember. Many generations have passed. Why are there only old men in his village? I see women, children, but I don't see young men. Where are the men? Many of them were killed. Others escaped. Ask him who are the looters that are slaughtering colonists. Where do they come from? I'm sure he's lying. I know you're lying. You're protecting the men of your village. I want to see the men. Otherwise, I'll hang him on a tree like a pig. Understood? I'll hang you on a tree like a pig. Hey, look at me. If I don't see the men of your village, I'll empty my charger on your balls. I swear to God. You need to answer.. Some of my men died today at the beach. Tual, get your ass over here. - I found something. - Wait. I need to talk to you. Michelet, go on with the questioning. Yes, Lieutenant. Faster, Tual. What are those threats? Those villagers are feeding looters. It's only old people and women here. - Those who shot us come from here. We need the population to be on our side. They must understand we're here to help. - They'll shoot us from behind. - That's enough! - It's an order. - Yes, sir. Yes, Cariou? I found a flag and Vietminh tracts. - Quoc, translate this. - Yes, Lieutenant. Goddammit. What's this? It's propaganda, boss. It says: "come and join Free Vietnam. "Fight France and colonialist imperialism." "Ho chi Minh..." What the hell is this? Huh? You don't know the looters? Are you taking us for fools? Tell me where they are. Otherwise, I'll burn everything down. Translate that, so he can understand. No more messing around. I don't want anyone of you supporting those looters. I'll execute whoever does. It's St John's Eve! Come on, hurry up. Burn it down. We're not there yet. Pass me the sausages! What is it? It smells. It's the Vietminh. What did you say? The Vietminh. They kill the villagers who help the French. What does it say? "Long Live Uncle Ho". It's revolting. We're dealing with primitive dogs, guys. Let's keep going. Come on. Be careful! Nobody moves! Do not walk. Minefield, Lieutenant. They let us get in but not out. Let's turn around. Don't move! - Be careful. - Get up really slowly, guys. Get up, guys. We're turning back. We'll walk in one another's footsteps. Be careful. Samuel, you go first. Lieutenant, we can't leave him here. No, no more dead soldiers. We're turning back. We can't let them put his head on a stake. - Walk in one another's footsteps. - Fuck! Look around. Tual! What are you doing? No, Quoc. What are you doing? Come, Cariou. Cariou, you come with me. Easy. Follow in your brothers' footsteps Cariou, you come with me. Follow my steps. Are we done? Come here. Spread your arms. - Nothing to report. - We're good. Hey! Where are you going? - Cariou! Where is he going? - Hey! You have to stop! For fuck's sake. Hey! Stop your goddamn boat. Hey! - Hey! - Where are you going? Pull over. Quoc, take two men. Don't let them leave. Come here! Pull over against the bank. - Come here. - We need back-up. Come down here! We need you! - Move. - Move! You take aim. Stay here, stay here. Get the bags out! The ducks too. We'll check everything. Why didn't you stop? We told you to stop. What's this? You're carrying weapons? Weapons for the rebels? Quoc, come here. Ask him what it is. What? What did he say? To hunt animal. "To hunt animal"? Are you freaking kidding me? You hunt ducks with this? There might be more. It's for the rebels. Here, take this. come on! Machetes, Lieutenant. Get out! come on. Get down. Get down! I said get down! Get down, you bastard. Understand what I'm saying? Get down! Get down! Look out! Oh, shit! Fire! To the border. Fire! Get down. Get down. Goddammit, we can't let them run away. Fuck! Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Are you alone? Are you alone or not? This is a rebel? A half-naked guy with an old gun! Really? Bring him over. Same weapons as those we found on the ship, Lieutenant. How many men? Where's your base? What routes? Show me on the map. How many men? He says what? He says Ho chi Minh will win... Screw Ho chi Minh. They're full of propaganda. Ask him about the others. Where are they? Same nonsense. Speak! I'll speak! Untie me! Okay, alright. Untie me! Come on, untie him. - Come here and untie him. - Come help him. Cariou, come here. Fuck, he cut his tongue out. What will we do with them? We can't bring them with us. And we can't free them either. They knew the risks. They're forcing us to make war. Lieutenant, can the guys relieve themselves with the girl? Are you insane? Touch her and I'll send you before the council. Can I take charge of the execution? I'd like to know how it feels to kill a man. Alright, you do it. Cariou, go with him. Release the girl. Release her! Now? French soldiers, liberation soldiers against the Asian invaders, don't be the German of the Viets! Join the Vietnamese people's fight for their independence from the colonists. Desert France... Samuel, make a fire. We're going to eat. We're hungry. Tomorrow, we have to get to mount 17. Here. The area is infested with Viets, but they are nowhere. Lieutenant is lost. He learnt about war at school. The people are against us. He didn't expect peasants to hide Viets. The caporal and the others, were they really going to rape that girl? If the Lieutenant had said yes, would you have agreed with that? The caporal seems like a good soldier. Gun possession, on the other hand... She should have been punished. That's the order. French soldiers, join the people in their fight for freedom... He's resuming his boring speech. What if he's right? What if we're like the Heinies? Our generals are jerking us around with their stories about the Japanese, Vietnamese looters and their tracts. Ho chi Minh, Vietminh... I'd never heard of that. My brother was tortured to death by the Heinies, and I saw everything. They ripped his eye out. And they made him drink fuel. He was throwing up blood. It's normal to shit in your pants when you're being shot at. Do you think I don't shit mine? However, you cannot let fear make you doubt. So, in case you need to hear it, let me tell you: we are not like the Heinies. We're going to stick together. You, Quoc and I. We're going to be a team. Saigon Summer of 1946 Hello. Can I have a beer, please? Thank you. In France, things were presented to me in a certain way. But now, I don't know. I feel I was lied to. And then there's that voice in the jungle... Some guys with a loudspeaker. They repeat the same speech all night long. We're fighting against peasants. They don't even wear uniforms. They're civilians. It's hard to talk about it. I can't even talk to one of my mates. It's too dangerous. What do you think? Do you want independence? Revolution? Do you know who Ho chi Minh is? André, this is a cousin of mine, Bath. He works at the Saigon hospital. It's okay. Hello, André. Hello. Can I have a seat? Yes, of course. Are you coming from the South? From... cholon? Go cong? My Tho? You've seen harsh things. How was that experience for you? I would like to introduce you to a friend. A French who's been living here for some years now. I'm sure it would do you good to share thoughts with him. Bath! Good evening. Come in. Good evening. - Is Brunel here? - Yes. He's waiting for you. Hello. André. I would like to introduce you to a friend: André. - Jacques. - I'm André. Nice to meet you. We don't want to subdue you. We just want to help you. You know, I'm not exactly a friend of the colonists. I don't like the way they behave. But France losing Indochina is just... I mean... We've brought many things here. And you've taken a lot, too. André, how can you be so naïf? Even the Americans recognized the right to self-determination. I'm here to fight the Japanese. - I'm discovering the situation. - Your general staff are complete warmongers. They're waiting for the first spark to take arms. I work at a school. I teach French, the History of France, the values of the Republic: liberty, equality, fraternity... The problem is that my students are all Vietnamese. French is not their language or part of their history. How would you react if you were them? Exactly. I get the feeling I'm teaching a huge lie. We have to get independence through democratic means. Military conflicts must be avoided. Mutual aid and understanding. What do you want from me? I'm on the French side. Are you looking for soldiers to convert? You're not really his cousin. André, you're against imperialism. You want our people to gain independence. Wait on. I wouldn't phrase it in such direct terms. Let's just say it's important that people with good will, from both sides, put heads together to avoid the worst. Namely, war. Here. I have something for you. You'll find out who you're fighting against. It won't bite you. It's a book. Is your regiment going to Hanoi? That's good. You'll have plenty of time to read it. We'll talk about it later. November 11, 1946. The French army bombs Haiphong. 6,000 killed. War is imminent. That's it, guys! Here we go! We'll give those yellow dwarves a good thrashing. France... France... France belongs to the French! France... France belongs to the French! No, louder. France belongs to the French! France belongs to the French! Yeah, that's right. Come here, beautiful. No, no. Opium? come with me! No, no... You see, no more opium... I've had enough. You're tired because of the weapons. I'll be soft. I can make whatever you like, - love and war. - No, no. Love... War... Listen to me, I don't want to make war. I don't want to. Come with me. You and I... are going to boom-boom. No, no. Exactly, boom-boom... Boom-boom is in my head. In my head. With all their shit, I don't want to celebrate war. Come upstairs. I will take care of you. Come. - No. - Come. Come, come. Come. We're going to the front. We're going where it burns. Right? Are you drunk or what? Come on, Sergeant. Help yourself. The Tonkin girls are here to bless us. Camp near Hanoi January, 1947 Go, go, go! Go, go! Right to the line! Come on, climb. Hurry up. I grab the throat and the nose. He makes no noise. In just one movement, I cut the throat and the carotid. We get down to the ground. Still no noise. I stab him in the heart and wait until he dies. - Is that clear? - Yes, chief! Quoc, Cariou! In pairs. We're going to get really close to the enemy in a Vietminh zone, where they don't expect us. Be careful... Those guys are like wild animals in the jungle. They can see in the dark. They're able to spend hours without moving, without even breathing. They're silent as shadows. We'll be like them. Our name: "the Black commando". We're going to proceed at night. Quoc will teach us how the Viets communicate. Attention! - Colonel... - Tual. This is Sergeant Cariou. I remember you. I'm glad to see you here. - And Sergeant Quoc. - I salute you, sir. Is everything alright? - Have the men we need? - We will. I want you to spread confusion as far as possible beyond the enemy lines. Hit-and-run raids, sabotage, targeted destruction. There's something else. Another mission. Concurrently with our protection actions, we have to reassure and gain them over. I want you and your commando to spread terror. The Vietminh forces the population to collaborate. Either they join up, or they kill them. We're going to do the same. This time around, no mercy, no quarter. We have to strike their minds. Be implacable. The villagers must tremble at the thought of betraying us. We will terrorize and get rid of civilians. That's where the Vietminh hides. You won't have to answer to anyone but me. Regarding the modus operandi in the field, needless to say, you have free rein. There are some weak people within the general staff who are blind and refuse to take action. That's criminal. This is not a classic war. Those little monkeys who we thought were subjugated and submitted to the colonists, are now revolting. We're leaving. We're dealing with people who are willing to die for the revolutionary mash they've been forced to eat. We'll leave Hanoi in three days. That's when your job will start. Alright, guys? Yes, colonel. Colonel. If you tell a Vietminh to cut a head off, he'll do it. Because it's an order. No questions asked. No matter if it's the head of an innocent or even his own. No mercy, no guilt... Their ideology comes first. They can give their life for it. They know how to fight the enemy, chief. But the Vietminh's true strength is their mind. Why are you with us, Quoc? I want Vietnam to be independent. But I'm a christian. And the Vietminh prohibits my religion. The colonists treat us like dogs. But communists kill my God. Tonkin Spring of 1947 No Vietminh. They might get here during the night. Don't move. We'll wait here. They'll give us the chance of making the Black Commando known. We'll take no prisoners. How do you say Black commando? Write it down. He says the Vietminh makes him fight. He has nothing against the French. The Vietminh killed his brothers for the revolution. Don't believe him, sir. He's a Vietminh. Wait. Tell him... If you speak, you'll save your skin. Understood? Show us your tracks, take us to your base and I'll let you go, I promise. Are you a Vietminh, yes or no? Do you know Chi Minh? The Vietminh will kill him. He wants us to do it. What's the truth in this heap of shit? Will you speak? Will you speak, son of a bitch? Prove what you're saying or I'll kill you. Do you understand? I will shoot you. He's just a peasant. Goddammit! Speak, you fucker! Speak! Freaking shit! I will spare your life because I want you to let the people around you know about the existence of the Black Commando. The Commando acts just like the Vietminh. We'll show no mercy for the enemy and its supporters: men, women... No prisoners. We'll put a bullet in the head of every Vietnamese who helps the Vietminh and doesn't spontaneously cooperate with the French army. Tell your friends we're here. Now go. Go! Go! We have to become their worst nightmare. They have to shit their pants upon hearing our name. I want suicidal missions and I want us to win. They have to think we're indestructible. See the Lung Chen mountain, their supposedly impregnable HQ? I want that mountain. I don't want soldiers. I want killers. You, Quoc and I. Alright? Alright. Village of Tay, Northern Tonkin Fall, 1947 Hey, guys, we did it! We've won the war! The Commando's burning the gods. Congratulations, guys. We have lots of surprises for them. That one's for me. It's a wild boar. We'll take it to the barracks. Hey, look! The mini god's clearing off. Hey! I can't believe that moron. Sergeant! Sergeant! The old guy cut his finger off. Lang Son Hill, Tonkin Early 1948 All together! They're shooting rockets now. They're too many. Hold the line! Damn it, hold the line! School's over. You have to hold the line! Get back to your position. Get back to your position. We're going to die, sir! Everybody, charge! An eye for an eye! Cariou's photos. Do you want to send these or should I do it? Put it with the rest. I'll write a letter to his parents. You'll send it too. We should have found the body. I trained him. I know his worth. He was with us when we opened fire in that hill. I'll mention his case. Maybe he was wounded. He hid somewhere. He must have died there. Deserter! French! Ho Chi Minh. Ho Chi Minh. Deserter! Deserter! Show me your papers! What's your regiment? Papers, papers! 6th Colonial Infantry Division. Sergeant Cariou. Prisoner. Deserter. He speaks Vietnamese. You must write the report. Salt on your tongue for one minute, every morning. This is for the light. This is for toilette. Wait here. Do not go out. Why do you want to join us? I can't stand what the French are doing here. And I don't want to kill men and women who... are fighting for legitimate ideas. What ideas? Are you a communist? You have the right to be free. You want us to be independent, to win the war, to throw the French out? You want that with us? Since I got here, I've read things, I've asked myself questions. If you don't ask yourself questions, you lose your mind. Do you know what the Vietminh is? Yes. Are you sure you're ready to kill French soldiers? I'm not at war with France. My whole family's there. But I can't stand what the army makes us do here. 6th Infantry Division. You're a traitor to France. If you get back to them, you'll be executed. I'm ready to do anything, I can give you information, but I can't kill anymore. What did you do when you fought the Germans? I didn't fight that war. Are you sure there's nothing else? Maybe you're an infantry sergeant on a special mission? We'll do some research about you. If you're a traitor, we'll kill you. Stalin is like Uncle Ho in the Soviet Union, which has become a great country. Its new revolutionary system is so good, that the Russian production is increasing. The car production, nonexistent before the revolution, is so efficient that a worker can buy himself a limousine for the price of 30 chickens. Now that you know what communism brings, like growth and happiness to the people, it is your turn to show what you can bring to the revolution. You'll take part in every party, you'll talk to the people as a good communist comrade. You'll say you want Vietnam to be free. Give some details... The blood, the massacres of villagers, the raped women... It's not all of the army. Not all of them are like that. You're here to strike our minds. I want you to give the people strong images. We want to introduce you as a friend, a friend of our cause, a friend of our people, a friend of liberty and revolution. André. André! Umm... I first arrived here... thinking that France was a defender of fraternal values. I thought it cherished the idea that the peoples could live together as friends, in freedom. But I soon realized that all that was a bunch of lies. They lied to me. France lies to its soldiers. The general staff and the government are hypocrites. They don't say the truth. The truth... The truth... is that France is an imperialist country. The truth... The truth is that France is conducting a dirty war. That's the truth. Thank you. Thank you, comrades. At least, he'll be born in a free country, to a nice family. He'll be born in a free country but not to a nice family. His father died on the battlefield. What are you going to name your baby? Mung Bao. "Mung Bao"? What does it mean in French? Why in French? You'll have to learn our language without resorting to French. "Mung Bao" if it's a boy. I want this baby to be a boy. Even in the free country that Uncle Ho promises us, it will always be easier for boys. Are you ready to kill the French? This war has to stop. And I'm willing to fight for that. The French must go back home and grant freedom to this country. The Vietminh welcome their allies with open arms. I won't lie to you. For me, a man who betrayed once can always betray twice. I expect more from you. I want you to prove me your adherence to our cause. Tonkin - Fall 1948 French soldiers, this is a former French soldier speaking. A deserter who chose the camp of freedom. This war is not yours. Cariou, is that you? Shut up, you nasty traitor! Fuck you and your damn speaker! Lay down your weapons. Don't be like the Heinies. It's him, sir. We didn't hear him before. They're stopping. Wait for the signal. Attack! Kill them all! You, French boy. Come here. Come here! Interrogate. How many men on the track? Regiments! Who are you waiting for? What troop? What company? Come on, speak. Speak! Interrogate! Who are you waiting for? Who are you waiting for? How many troops? What's your regiment? Why are you clearing the land of mines? Fuck, are you going to talk? Kill that dog. If you're a communist, kill the French man. Prove it! It's an order. He's not a prisoner. Kill him! Sir! This one's alive. Nurse! Water. He's seriously injured. There was... A guy... A French guy. An ex-sergeant. I had seen him in Saigon. He shot my lieutenant down. It has to be him, sir. Bac Kan is a priority target. We have to take over that location. General Nguyen Binh Command Post Northern Tonkin, winter 1948 All our forces will be gathered there. Comrade Ky will be in charge of the attack. I already know who you are and how you're fighting with us. It's an honor, General. I want you to take part in the Bac Kan attack. Thanks to you, dozens of Vietminh lives will be saved. Comrade Mung Bao, I want you to spare my men from massacre. Look. Ky will launch a massive attack on the north side of Bac Kan. I want you to intervene on the south side. You will wear a French uniform. What's this uniform? Is this blood? No problem. I will wash it and fix the holes. Try it on... It's very good. André, this is Phong. He's with us. Hi, André. I'm Phong. Formerly known as Hans. Hey. Are you German? 5th Foreign Infantry Regiment. I joined up six months ago. Captain? Major? - Captain. - Captain. You're a captain. Put it on the buttonhole! I can't wear this. There was a dead man inside. You'll save our soldiers. Besides, the General doesn't give you a choice. Fire! Bac Kan fort - Northern Tonkin Early 1949 Plus twelve degrees! Ready! Fire! Steady. Wait for the signal. Let's go. Open the door! Hey! Open the door! - Come on! - What are you doing here? I've lost half of my men. Open the door. We're under attack. We already know that, you assholes. - What unit? - 2nd company, 1st CP. Come down! Wait, Captain... It's an order. Come down! They're going to massacre us. Open the door. Hurry up! - Open the door, goddammit! - I don't know if I can let you in. Listen to me. I'm a captain, so you better shut the fuck up and open that goddamn door. Okay, Captain. I'll let you in. Hurry up. Piece of shit! Stinking traitor! Are you going to be okay? Put them against the wall! Quick! The Vietminh massacre is about to begin! Ho Chi Minh shows his support to those who fight along our lines. That's what our informants say. He does it in person, secretly. This information has been confirmed. What do you mean, "secretly"? Few people come with him. Just a couple of squads, at night, without notice... Indeed, his death will be devastating for the Vietminh. Probably lethal. Too dangerous in Viet area. We don't move. Got it. There's something else, Colonel. The deserter, that traitor in a French uniform, for Ho Chi Minh, shows that the French are against the war and ready to fight their own army. "Mung Bao. "A white soldier is fighting "for the independence of the Vietnamese people. "French soldier deserts". It didn't take long. The Vietminh propaganda is using it already to incite desertion. Their power play makes us look like idiots and demoralizes our young soldiers. Lately, there have been some isolated cases of desertion that must remain confidential, of course. Quoc, I want that Mung Bao guy dead. Let's get moving. No hesitation. We'll pay for the info that leads to him. Mung Bao... It could be Cariou. I don't know. It'll be hard to catch him if he hides in a Vietminh area. Sir, I think we have something. It's here, it's here. Come on, get up! Shh! - He's completely wasted. - On the chair. Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey! Where's the guy who told you about Ho Chi Minh? Wake up! Where is he? Ask him where that is. Where? Where? - A few rooms away. - Okay. Tell him to take us. He's coming with us. Is it here? Is it here? Is it here? Come on, come on. Let's go. Michelet, he's running away! I'm on my way! Go get the drunk guy. Go! Damn. We won't spend the night running. Are you going to speak? What village is Ho Chi Minh supposed to visit? You're a fucking Vietminh! What's the village called? Speak! What's this? You have a weapon in your house? Why do you have pamphlets? Who gave them to you? Who are them for? Hey, these pamphlets... What are they about? Huh? They ask you to prepare an event. What is it? Is it Ho Chi Minh? When is Ho Chi Minh coming? From where? I'm talking to you. Answer me! Answer me! Where's your village? Where is it? What is it called? What's your village called? - What? - Mirao. Mirao. Mirao. See? It wasn't that complicated! Quoc, let's go. We'll settle this on our own. Screw the hierarchy. It's quiet. They're only peasants. He's screwing with us. Are you sure this is your village? It's moving, sir. Our Uncle is coming! Everybody hurry up! That's Ho Chi Minh. There's Cariou. What are they doing? He's getting out? Is he leaving or what? They're hiding Ho Chi Minh. They have tunnels. Alright. Six men for the sentries. Quoc, with me. We'll go down there and kill Ho Chi Minh. Along with Cariou. Okay? That way, that way. You, over there. Where did they go? Where do these tunnels lead to? It goes deeper, sir. Mattei, get inside. Wait, wait. They've opened fire. They're firing. Shh, I can't hear. Shit, they're throwing grenades. We have to get out. Get out! It's going to be okay, Robert. You were in a very bad shape. You're a goddamn miracle man. Your men weren't as lucky. - Who found me? - Quoc. Is he alive? He's injured, but he'll make it. Don't worry. You sure got screwed over. Why the hell did you enter that tunnel? The real Ho Chi Minh never left his hideout. It was a trap... A set-up planned by Cariou. As soon as you get better, you'll return to France. Your game is over, son. You'll get an extra medal and we'll find you a nice job. It's going to be alright. Out of the question. Your pelvis and your legs are screwed. Do you understand? It's over. It's over. Hanoi November, 1949 Chief... Just like yours. And I have new stripes. No, don't get up. - I will be ready soon. - Okay. I was... I was designated at random. Me and ten other men. We were all evacuated. Evacuated. I don't know why. They wanted us to tell what we had seen. But the others were taken to the camps, to the North... near the Chinese border. Half of the people die before even getting there, and the other half just rot... or starve to death. A White is in charge of those camps, a French man. He writes the propaganda, I've been told. Is there any chance to get some opium here? Please... I'll find you some. Here. Easy. Sit up. Easy... Shh... Careful. Shh... That white guy... Do you know anything else? What is his name? Shh... Our posts are going down... The backup teams are being crushed. We're losing the Chinese border, that's why we're evacuating Cao Bang and... withdrawing to the delta. Problem is, the RC4 has become a real deathtrap. But they're taking more and more prisoners. Not out of mercy. Killing so many men would damage those bastard's international image. And you insist on coming back. What do you want? Another medal? Huh? What about the cane? Will you bring it? You can have it. Come in! What did you find out? Cariou's commando is wreaking havoc but he's not a part of it anymore. I don't even know if he's still alive. Do you think he's supervising the camps? Route RC4, near Cao Bang Northern Tonkin - October, 1950 Sergeant! Are we almost there? About 20 more kilometres. Be careful. It's Viet infested. You're going to get yourselves killed, guys. This evacuation is nonsense. - Thank you. - Good luck. OK, we're good. He saw a white man, but he doesn't know if he's French. How did he meet that white man? Where did he hear about him? He doesn't know. He would say anything to be released. The camps are 100 km into the Vietminh area. It could be Cariou or any other white man. We're not here for that. We're not prepared. We don't have enough men. Let us go! We want to fight with the French soldiers! The Captain is back. He would like to see you. We're expecting a massive attack. Maybe tomorrow or in two days... We have zero chance, but we'll fight to the end. In the meantime, let's try to pick up the guys coming from Cao Bang. The orders are preposterous. It's truly a mess. Listen, if you want to find Colonel Bertrand, get in touch with what's left of the 8th RTM. They're looking for his battalion, if it still exists. The Black Tiger returns. I'm pleased to meet a guy like you, a living legend. We made a mistake. We were wrong. Since the beginning. We humiliated them. Even if it's bullshit, Uncle Ho lied to them a lot better than us. That's why today nothing, and I mean nothing, will ever stop them. Get out! Get out! Where are they? Any injured? Chief! You have to take cover, sir! - Alright? - They got Quoc. We have two injured. We need to go to That Khé. Without Quoc, we won't survive. I want two men for Quoc. Take his legs. Two injured. - Take them to the truck. - Come on, come on! Take him to the truck. Prisoner! Prisoner! No more war! No more war! Leave. Don't stay. Go die somewhere else. Nasty French soldier. OK. OK. Get out of here! Come on! Prisoner. Prisoner. Plain soldier. I don't want to make war. Are you thirsty? Do you have family? Dad, mom, brother, sister? Brother, yes. Do you think about him? You must not lose hope. You're coming with us. Stéphane Peragi, shack number 7. Jean-Yves Bordier, shack number 5. Dominique Hermant, shack number 9. David Mermite, shack number 5. Victor Laurentis, shack number 3. You have to express, according to your own conviction, with moving, sincere words, the reasons that prompt you to ask the French government for the cease of fire, and the withdrawal of the imperialist forces from Vietnam. The five best letters will be sent to the French embassy, to L'Humanité and to your families. That might make them known. The authors will gain points for their future release. He who writes the worst letter will spend two days in the cage. Professor, let me tell you something: Go to hell. The release is never going to happen. Pascal, you've been a prisoner for a couple of months and you're already losing hope. We've been subjugated by your people for several decades and not once have we lost hope of regaining our freedom. You'll write that letter with all your heart to keep the flame of freedom alive. Black Tiger, welcome to hell Shack number 3. Laurentis, on the side. Shack number 5. Arnaud! Shack number 9. Oh, shit. Lieutenant. What are you doing here? I'll bring you some water. OK? Here. Hey! Hey! Hey! Rice duty. Line up. Martin! Saul! Orlando! The others, bury the dead. Line up. Yes. I think we saw him once. Apparently, he manages several camps. He interrogates the prisoners. He looks for information. I don't know exactly what he does. He has a rank among the Viets. If it is him, he goes by a Viet name. This guy has a baby face. Tell the camp chief who I really am. Tell him that... you want to earn points for your release. Turn me in. I'm not a snitch. Ask Marcellin and Henzel, the two informers of the camp. They'll leak it to the Viets. That's good. Make sure they do the job. Whisper to their ears. I'll keep on telling I'm Laurentis. You will support me. I want to make the camp chief doubt. He'll bring the only man who can identify me: the Frenchman. What if it's not him? What if it's not the man you're looking for? I want to see him first. Come on, get back to work. Oh, shit. It's lieutenant Delappe. - Laurentis! - Yes, sir! Come with us, now. - Why, sir? - Do not argue. Stop what you're doing. Come. Sit down. Why is there no photo on your card? I don't know. I can't hear you! I don't know. It must have... It must have fallen off during the combat. Tell me your name, rank and military responsibilities. Victor Laurentis, corporal, 3rd CPG. Look at me! I want to know your name, rank and military responsibilities. Victor Laurentis, corporal, 3rd CPG. Look at me. Your name, your rank, and your military responsibilities. Victor Laurentis. He's the Black Tiger. That's the rumour going around. And we all know what he did against the Vietnamese. It's not because he's French that we're not going to condemn a killer. So let's act as good communists and get rid of those who took advantage of this war to lend themselves to their most basic instincts. I've heard the prisoners say something different. Laurentis looks like the Black Tiger, but it's not actually him. I agree with Henzel. We should condemn the real Black Tiger, but not an innocent. I don't think Laurentis is the Black Tiger. I saw him once, in person. He looks like him. But in my opinion, it's not him. Listen to me carefully. As long as we're not sure... about his real identity, the whole camp will be punished. No more food. Some of you are too weak. They will die. And it will be the fault of each and every one of you. You're not a common soldier for the Vietminh. You're not an ordinary prisoner. You're a killer. You leave dead soldiers in your path. It seems you trick them by wearing the French uniform. I'm not a part of any commando. I just make the prisoners join the Vietminh cause. Is that what you do now? You lecture people? You're a head teacher? Do you realize the situation you're in? They want you dead. Listen to me. Trying to convert you would be useless. I want you to save your men. You're the Black Tiger, a symbol of courage and heroism for the French army. I want you to ask for the cease of fire. If you do, I'll release all of the prisoners. They'll go back home, to their families. But not you. The truth is, I will keep you here until your army withdraws. If you - the Black Tiger - give up this war, I know your decision will have an impact on the French opinion. And no one will ever imagine that you lie to save your skin, that the Black Tiger's a traitor. Peace must be your next battle. Help us obtain it. Are you kidding me? The mayhem has just started. You know it very well. Hey! Your buddies, Mao, Stalin, they're eating up the world. There's no peace in this story. What are you talking about? So tell your bosses... The ones who want to execute me for my crimes without a process... Tell them I did the same things that I saw in their jungle - your jungle. Your ideological conversion - even if it's fake, I don't care - will be the only condition for the release of all the prisoners. You want the Black Tiger to become a Red Tiger. You're going to make me sign papers. You'll display me in front of your villagers as if I was a circus freak. You're brother was a soldier too. You're both patriots. The difference is, he was a partisan. You're an invader. Sit down. Sit down! I'm worth more alive than dead. How are we going to eliminate him? You know the prisoners well. Ask them to join us. They must be reliable and ready to fight. Alright. Listen to me. The weapons are in the chief's desk, in the back. His assistant has the keys. He'll be our first victim. We need to figure out how to open the window. Let's say we eliminate him. What are we going to do next? We go back home. I'll take the Black Commando to Hanoi. The jungle is Viet-infested before getting to the French zone. I'm not saying we'll succeed. We'll just fight to the end. That's all. Go, go. Come back. Tual, come here for a second. Have you thought about it? I'm not like you. Betraying is not easy for me. - I need some time. - It's not just about you. Have you talked to the others? Honestly, most of them would spit on my face. Those men have fought. They've seen their friends die. You deserted like a coward. You used the occasion to run off like a dog. And now you're stuck with the Viets. You can't go back to France. You'll do whatever it takes to save your skin. You know, I searched for you after the combat. I looked for you. I really hoped we would find you. What we were asked to do... it was unthinkable. But I did it because it was our mission. I didn't enlist to become a man. I enrolled to make war, and to win it. You asked me what it was like to kill a man. Now that you kill hundreds of them, you know it better than me. I should ask you... what you're doing here. You say you awaken a new conscience within us. You want us to betray ourselves. Otherwise, we'll die. Is that your idea of a more free, fair world? What you're doing here is disgusting. You're not a honourable man. I'll tell you the truth. I hate the man I used to be. What you made me become. A war dog at his master's feet. I lost my mind, Robert. I was alone. I had no one to talk to. Especially not those privates who fuck the same whore. Because I was not a canon fodder. I'm not a child of the fatherland who falls for anything, who can be fooled. The Vietminh allowed me... to become a real soldier. I learned to accept the horrors of war. But I also chose the reason of my combat. Unlike yourself, I no longer fight to win the war... I fight for it to end as soon as possible. I fight to bring peace to this country. What's behind that door? That's where we store our ammunitions and weapons. Put him in the cage. Sit down. I've offered a deal to the Black Tiger. His surrender and collaboration with the Vietminh in exchange for your release. Every one of you. You'll go back to France. You're going to disown him. I want him to feel you're very much against him. I want you to think of those who are waiting for you. You can't demand that. I'm not... I can listen to all your political nonsense, but not this. I didn't ask for your opinion. If you disobey, I'll kill you. Here. Easy, easy. How many men are with us? How many men are with us? They guys are too weak. They think it's a losing battle. We agree. It seems he offered you to release us all. I'll tell him that I accept his deal. He'll get me out of here. They will believe they've won. We'll take advantage of it. We'll attack the storeroom. The weapons... That letter... That letter to the government, maybe what he says is true. The Black Tiger could shake France up... Lay off me. We might not support you. - No... - We have to collaborate. Saving human lives is not a dishonour. A prisoner died this morning. There's nothing I could do. Apart from staying at his side. His last words were: "May the Black Tiger release us". I've been thinking about how you see yourself, about the Black Tiger. The Black Tiger can become your prison, like this cage. Where's the man I knew? The man who was ready to give up his life to save a dying soldier? The soldiers have lost their morale and their hope. You have to rescue them from this hell. I was injured. I was badly wounded. I need to walk a little so the blood can circulate. Take me out of here. I'll just make a few steps. It smells like shit. It stinks. I want to breathe. I need to walk. Oh, my friend. My dear friend. We got ourselves into deep shit by making this war. You'll soon be free. You and I are going to be at peace. Yes, I know... The Black Tiger... You'll finally be in peace. You would have wanted to get out of this jungle, too. The irony of this is that... I'm the only one who can get us out of here. There's something you should know. I came here for you... to find you. To eliminate the son of a bitch who runs this camp and kills my men. You have to fight to the end, Sergeant. Fight to the end.
