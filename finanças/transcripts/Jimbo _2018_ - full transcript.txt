The fuck are you guys always lead for? It's my fault. I over slept. Why that girl? She's keeping you up nights. So what's up? What do you got through straight the business. I liked that. I got a call from the Asians a few days ago. They need something bigger than usual. Call you. Why? How much bigger he had? He called me. I didn't know any, any permission. Talked to the chicks? No. It's not like that. It's just usually when Shannon needs to re up, I do. Well, you boy chain called me says they need 60 is that okay with you? 60 it's three times what they usually get. They said why they need so much setting ran into something big and they need to stock up the fuck. We've been dealing with these handles for five years now. We know the solid. Yeah, I know. It's just if we do this, we're going to be dry for a while. There's a fuck about being dry. This is huge. You don't go on vacation. If dentists, they talk numbers 45 a key that works. Yeah, it fucking works. They say when they want this to happen three days. Okay, we could do that. She's going to be fucking mint now. You can buy a chicken bigger rock. Fuck me. I loved Asians. What do you get married now? Yeah. Maybe you want my advice. Don't. We'll see. I'm not sure what's going to happen. Look at Jimmy all grown up. I remember the two of us came in here. You didn't fucking hair on your balls. Now you're getting married on fucking believable. Yeah. All right guys. Get out of here. I got a poor children the oven Thursday. Don't fuck it up. All right. How much are we looking at? This goes down about a millage after Dante Scott. All right. That's going to be beautiful. You don't think this is that all sketchy? Never moved this kind of weight before. Listen, if it had been someone we've never met before, then it definitely be suspect, but we've been dealing with the Asians forever. Yeah, you're right. How are we going to do this? Same as always. We're going to need a van though. Relax. [inaudible] detective Burke with the NYP, the FBI task force. The issue a search warrant for your house. Just let them do their thing. Everything upside down and give a shit what you do. Just keep looking at Jim. I can stop all this if you just tell me what your shit is. Some Steve. Sure thing. Jim. We'll keep fucking looking. Where's your stash shot? Jim, nobody's talking to you right now. Before you make the situation worse. Think about who you're talking to. Think about it. What's this gym? Well, that's not good. That's not good. Is this stuff yours or did it come with the apartment? Call the evidence team. Jim, you're under arrest. You're under arrest right now. Make sure he's got nothing on him too. Is he clean? No. No. Yeah. Jimmy, I'm not going to bullshit you. You were in a shit spot. They have a sealed testimony from sci, uh, drugs and money and your gun is slapping you with possession of unlicensed firearm too. Well, my options. Well, they offered you a deal. If you rat out Mikey, the crew and the Chinese and said you do 10 years probation, but more than likely you'll go into witness protection. There's no way I want to snitch out Mikey on the boy besides Dante or the Asians will never let that happen. They take me out in jail. Okay. They offer the same deal to Mike. He told them to eat his dick. Sounds like Mikey. What if I fight this? If you plead not guilty and lose, which chances are you will and I'm fucking good at this. You're looking at 15 to 20 years. What's the story with the CIA's it on outside of the Asians? No clue. He's a confidential informant, which means maybe three, four guys and both the FBI and the NYP YPD know who he is and even in the trial you're not going to find out. They wanted to keep going back to the, well whenever they can. Word is whoever the fuck this guy is. He's been working for the task force for years now. If I plead guilty seven to 10 years, would you only do about half of that? You'd still be a young man. Thanks for the silver lining counseling. How much time is Mikey looking at? Well, if he goes with not guilty, 10 to 15 but if he pleads guilty five to seven what's the time? How long do I have to decide? Well, the quicker the better. A few days tops. Okay. I want you guys to have this the hell while I'm away. Jimmy, is this drug money? Just take it. It's the least I can do, I think is such a fucking idiot. Oh, math. I'm sorry Paul. Just take it then that offering you anything. They are going have to snitch on everybody and that could be very bad. What do you mean bed? What are you looking at? If you cut a deal? Probation. Jme Kid. I see a no brainer. What are you thinking? Well, you got to help the police. I'd have to snitch on Mikey to, they offered him the same deal. He told them to fuck off. I don't understand why you don't want to make a deal. Makes no sense. Because these people are crazy. If I do that, you guys aren't safe and neither am I. You get it. Okay. Let's see. You were awake. I love you too, baby. I love you too, Bro. This is fucking crazy, man. I'm gonna miss you, motherfucker. I'm gonna miss you to stay up in there. Oh, well you're gone in a week, right? Yeah.

You know, Dante told me when you got out, we would get you back on your feet just like old times. I didn't want to tell you so soon, but we got something big cooking that we've been waiting on you to get out to do. Okay. I'm just gonna try and steer clear of Dante and all that shit.

I swear I snapped on him when I got out, but he wasn't about to listen to me. I just don't want anything to happen to the kid. I'm sorry Joe. I tried. I swear. Yeah, whatever. I'll try to straighten them out later. If someone came to you when you were 24 years old and told you to get out, what'd you shut up? I spoke to Keith, told me to come by his office, start work.

Let me ask, why is Jerry involved in any of this when you're talking about, why is it any asking me about business saying he's involved in something big. Jerry, I took Jerry and just like I took you to Joe Phelps in 15 years. Yeah, I'm going to be honest on today. I don't appreciate it. I don't want him involved in any of this shit. You don't have a choice. He's his own man. It's going to do what he wants. Yeah. I guess Mike can give us a minute. Really, really fucking. Really? Okay. Five years. Five years. Long time. Couldn't have been easy, but don't think for one second that you could come out. Tell me what to do, what not to do, who to talk to, who not to talk. Do you fucking understand it? Just got from my cousin. Dot. I will. I have. I always have. Come on now. Didn't Mike keep, keeps tell you what he's got cookie?

Really glad you're home. Jimmy. Jimmy. Boy, I don't understand why you gotta be mixed up with Dante and all this shit. I don't know why. I just did. Hey, you were gone and I don't know. I saw Dante out somewhere. He said if I ever need to work to come by, so I did. You really are a fucking idiot. You're going to see what a fucking idiot I am when I tell you what we got going on. I don't want to know Jim. He's like, you should have been looking after the stove. Shit, when you got out, Jim. I'm sorry Jim. This is big. I'm telling you what the fuck up, Jim. Just hear us out. If you don't want to end, we're understand. Dante probably fucked up. Just hear us out. All right. Tell me this mess or plan and see this shit. Okay, so no Mike, he's home. Alright. No Roosevelt Savings Bank. She's Christ. Well, that's what we're going to hit. Jerry works for the bullshit private security company noticing every two weeks at this specific Roosevelt, the store anywhere between four and 7 million for the night to be transferred to other locations throughout Brooklyn, Staten Island. They bring it in in the armored truck around three 30 right before they close and the next morning at nine 30 10 o'clock they pick it up. The banks open at eight 30 so sitting there plus million dollars is one security guard watching and that's when we're going to snatch. You guys have lost your fucking life, Bro. We've been clocking this place for the last six weeks. They never pick it up before nine 30 since. When are we fucking bank rock? Because it can work. Wow. When they're heavy, you take care of the crowd. We'd be in and out in five minutes. You still work for this company? Yeah, but only part time. Now I'm the guy who hauls it did the night before. I mean people in the bank wouldn't opens. That's the beauty is one fucking security guard was fucking 58 years old and too broad tellers and two managers. One shake. One Dude, you guys know if you get pits you're fuck for at least 15 years. I get that it's worth the risk. We go in there clean. They won't even know what fucking hit him. Jesus Christ. I can't control you guys. You guys do what you need to do, but just know that I can be part of. What are you looking to hit it? Five weeks for some reason on the 15th there's always more. I got a bunch of fucking John Villages. This is for this who are from Pennsylvania. Why didn't you don't know? You need to change a bad break. You could say that divorced, so it's okay. It happens, I guess. Yeah. How long were you married? Almost got married really well. I was living with someone. You don't seem like the type, I don't know. You seem like a player type. I would have never guessed that you were living with someone. All I was, I haven't bought a ring. Never gave it to her though. I carried it around with me in my pocket, which was about a month before I got arrested and I sold it. The patient, the lawyers. That's what she broke up with you when you got arrested? She stayed with me for about a year. Um, she expressed concerns about, um, the relationship. She's married now. Can I ask you something? Is it hard in jail? Yeah, it's pretty miserable when you're scared. MMM. Well, driving there I was, I was pretty freaked out once I got there and I got processed. I don't know if I was scared so much as just very aware of my situation. I don't know if that makes sense. I can't even imagine. You were in there for five years. Five and a half years almost. I was sentenced to 10, but I got out of my first parole here. Is that normal, you know, to get out of it your first try? No. Um, I got my degree inside. Um, good behavior and believe it or not, it was my first arrest. I'm trying to stay away all that shit from my past. It's easier said than done. It's complicated. Doesn't have to be, where's it going? Squares. Can we do this again? I don't want you to go. Yeah, glad you're here. Jumbo. I appreciate this, Keith. Seriously, thank you. Come on. It's the least that I can do. So what do you need me to do? Well, for now you're going to work with Addison estimating 100 ropes and then you can move up whatever you need. You try a bit about three to five jobs a week. So what we do is we split up drawings by trade and make copies for each specific trade to send to our subs to bid. When you don't, one job, you faulty beside of jars and get them ready to be signed with ups, the ups guy comes about for this thing, it's going to be your best friend. If you're not making copies, I'm going to send you off to drop kids off. Okay. This is you. Also, from time to time, I'm going to give you a list of approved contractors. You're gonna have to call each one and see if they would be interested in bidding for us for specific traits. I can do that. Sometimes. I may need some specific jobs. Copy.
