How're you doing, baby? - Mmm. - Holy crap, you look hot. - Yeah? Too hot? - No, like classy hot. I'm just so used to seeing you dolling up the other girls, I never see you all dolled up yourself. Oh, you look perfect, baby. - Thanks, Mom. Mom? Mom! Mom! No, no, no, no! Mom! Mom? No, no, no, no, no, Mom. Help! Please, help us! I don't know what happened, she just collapsed. - Mom? - Someone call 911! - Jesus. - Mom? Mommy? - Rachel. - Mom? - Daddy. - No! No! - Do something! - Oh, shit. Which have been also dusted in flower but not just to absorb any excess moisture. - Uh oh. "Great British Bake Off." What's up? - Nothing. - Come on, babe, you know you can talk to me. - It's just, it's like... It's a lot of pressure on me, you know? - I know. But we're in it together no matter what happens, right? Okay, I gotta go get ready. I have that shoot with that new bag company this morning. Are you gonna try and work today? Okay then, I will see you later. - It came. - What? - I went to the bathroom this morning and it came. My period, my uterus just wasted another 30-fucking-grand. - Are your sure? - Amber. - Okay. Was it like... Was it a full period or was it, I don't know, like spotting? - I mean, it was... I guess like spotting but I still, I have cramps, and then my back hurts and then... - Okay, do you remember what Dr. Fern said to us when we did our first cycle? - I know he said a lot before we gave him all our money. - I know but he said to us that spotting and cramping could be a sign of successful implantation. - You sure? - I am sure that that is what he said. So I am not trying to get our hopes up but there's no reason to get down yet, so... Come on. - What? - Come on, you're gonna go pee on a stick. I love peeing on sticks. Yes, we love them, all of them. There's a variety of ways to pee on a stick. - Okay. 40 more seconds. - Okay, please, please don't get too excited. - Oh, I'm not. I'm not. - You are! You're getting all smiley and stuff. I'm so sorry. - No. - I'm sorry. - You're gonna get my hopes up. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay. Look, look, mmm. No smiles and no hope. - Seriously. Dr. Fern said we shouldn't even bother with home pregnancy tests. - No, that is not what he said, babe. What he said was he didn't want us obsessing over it. You know, like taking a test every day. It's okay for us to take one. - Well it's easy for you to say. It's not your fault when it turns out to be negative. - Babe. No, no, no, no. It won't be anybody's fault, no matter what. And I'm here for you, okay? So I will calm down and chill out. - I'm sorry, I just, you know, you get anxious and then you start feeling this thing. - Okay. That's time. Here we go. - Oh God, please. Oh my God. - It's two lines! It's positive! - It's positive? - It's positive! - It's positive! - It's positive, oh my god! Oh my god, oh my god! Oh my god, Amber! God, we're gonna be parents. - Yeah. Holy... Baby! - Oh my god! - Congratulations, you're pregnant. - Hey, big sis. - Oh, no thank you, no, not for me. - What, you pregnant? - Gary! Shut up. - Oh my god! Are you guys seriously pregnant right now? Yeah. To us! - Okay, Mom and Dad, this one is from the two of us, for you guys. - Oh. - Happy anniversary. - Oh, thank you, that's so sweet. What is it, what is it? A baby! - Hey! Does it not totally suck not being able to drink? Because I feel like it would totally suck if I couldn't drink. - Congrats! You're so brave. I would never be able to bring a child into this world, what, with everything that's going on. - So, did you guys do the whole IVF thing or did you find some dude to do it the old fashion way? - Okay, the gel's gonna be a little cold at first. - Oh. There we are. You ready? Here we go. Okay, so... This is baby's brain. - Oh, wow. That's incredible. - Just gonna grab a few images while we're here so we can measure everything. And here is baby's heartbeat. It sounds great. Now for the big spoiler alert. Do you wanna know the sex? - Yes. It's a girl. Oh. - A girl? - Yeah. That's wonderful. Wait till you see her. - Oh, I wanna see her. - It's... - Show us. - Look at that. Look at that. - Oh, would you look at her. Isn't she previous? Oh wow. - Can you believe? What is that? - What? - Is that a face? - Oh wow. - There, in the corner. Doesn't that look like your mother, Rach? Or am I crazy? - No, it looks just like her. Spooky. - Daddy! - But... How is... - Rach, it's probably just a coincidence. You know, the shadows and the lights and the ultrasound. - You wanna know what I think? I think it's a blessing. I think it's a sign from God that she's still here. I love that, Mom. - Thank you. - Oh. Rach... - What? - Your nose. - Oh. - It's bleeding. - Honey, can I help you? - I'm sorry, I... Just excuse me. Sorry. - Rach. - Oh, I got it, I got it. It's fine, I got it. I love you guys. - We love you too. Bye-bye. Drive safe. - We will. - We will. Well, that got a little weird. - I just saw my dead mom's face in our sonogram. Sorry, I don't really know how to feel about that. - Rachel, I told you it was just-- - I know, it's shapes and shadows. Look, I know, I know, I know that's what it is but... I mean, it looks exactly like her. That can't be a coincidence. I mean, it can't. - Okay, so what if it is? Come on, your mom was like the nicest person I know and that includes you. Look, I'm just gonna go ahead and say that if your mom's face is popping up in our daughter's sonogram, well, I'm gonna take that as a good thing. Like maybe my mom was right and maybe this is a kind of blessing. A sign that your mom is watching over our little daughter. - You know you're the best, right? - I try. - Maybe it's a sign that we should name her after her. Little Sarah? - I really love that. - Really? - Yeah, of course. I love Sarah. - Excuse me. Hi. Can I please get a decaf Americano? What size can I get you? Medium. Thanks. - Bet I can guess. - Sorry? - Bet I can guess the sex. Girl. - Wrong. Thanks for playing though. Medium caramel macchiato. Hello? Caramel macchiato. - I think that's for you. - You know, you shouldn't be carrying all those bags. - I appreciate your concern but I'm fine, thanks. - Put on a jacket at least, it's chilly. - I'm perfectly comfortable, yeah, but thanks. - Put on a goddamn jacket! Uh... Oh. Are you okay? I'm sorry. Ma'am, you... You have a... - It's really good, we're doing great. Can you believe you're gonna be an uncle? No we're not. Um... Hey, can I call you back later? Yeah, Rach just got home. Okay, love you. Are you, oh my god. What happened? - I don't know. There was a guy at the coffee shop and he just-- Jeez. - My nose started bleeding and, I don't know, I just freaked out. - Okay, okay, okay. You're home, you're home, you're safe. But, first of all, what guy? Wow. What a fucking asshole. It's not even like it's that cold outside. I'm sorry, babe, I know that's not the point. - It's not just him though, you know. Everybody's been treating me weird. It's like I'm not... I'm not a person. I'm just this incubator. - Hey. Of course you're a person. You are the best kind of person. As a matter of fact, you are my favorite kind of person. - I don't mean you, I mean everybody else. I mean, our friends and your family and random strangers. It's just... Everybody keeps treating me like I don't know how to take care of myself. - Babe, that is just the way the world treats pregnant ladies. But look, I've said it before and I will say it again. If it's not you and it's not me, screw them. We don't need help. Right? - Yeah. - Look, I don't want you to take this the wrong way but do you think that maybe there's a chance that our friends and my parents, they just wanna support you but it's a little hard for you to accept that support because you didn't grow up with a big family? - What does that have to do with anything? - No, I just mean, for a really long time it was just you and your mom and now she's gone. But my parents and our friends, we're your family too. And, although we may not always say the right thing, we mean well. - Really? Okay, so it's my fault. - Oh wow. Rachel, that is not what I said at all. - Okay. Just listen. I am the one who has to go through this and it is hard. So I would appreciate it if I felt like you had my back. - I do have your back. I always have your back. I am just worried... I am just worried that you're gonna push everyone away like you did when your mom died. - And there it is. - Rachel. Rach, wait, oh... I'm sorry. This is all coming out wrong. Okay, listen, what I should've said, what I should've said was, the hell with that guy. The hell with anyone that looks at you funny. It doesn't matter, they don't matter, because the only thing that matters is you, me and this baby. Our baby. The three of us. Okay, that is it. I'm sorry. And it's still breathing. Look at that fresh, fresh cherry. Nice to see both sides. She's going to take it. - Mom? - She's going to take the baby. - What're you-- - You have to stop her. - Who? - She knows I'm here. She won't let me talk to you. You can't let her take the baby. Don't let her control you! - Mom. Mom. - Rachel. Rachel. Rachel. Rachel? Mom! What happened? - No, everything's fine, you're fine. - No, my mom was just-- - No. - She was right here. - No, honey. No, you were just having a nightmare. Come here. It's just a bad dream. - She was here. - No, you're fine. Everything's fine, okay? Rachel? - She's here. Babe, you're up. - If you have to take it, just... - It's just the agency. - It's fine. - I'll be right there, I promise. - Okay. Hey you guys, hold on. Let me step out, I'm in the doctor's office. - Yeah. Looks good. Any headaches? - Huh? No. - Also good. Yeah, I don't think there's anything to worry too much about. - Dr. Fern, I don't see how you think it's nothing to worry about. - Look, I didn't say it's nothing to worry about, I said it's nothing to worry too much about. Nose bleeds are a common symptom of pregnancy. - Dr. Fern, if you'd seen it, you'd know that there was nothing common about it. - I know it must've been very scary. A nose can bleed a lot but I assure you it's fine. Just hormones and stress. - Hormones and stress. - That's right. - What if it's not just hormones and stress? What if it's like a brain tumor or something like an aneurism? - The billing department would love for me to order a bunch of tests to rule out that very unlikely possibility but I'm telling you it's just not necessary. At least, not yet. It's my opinion as your doctor that the best course of action is for us to just keep an eye on things and try to avoid all stressors. Okay, all right, if it'll make you feel better, I can order up some blood work but I really don't think you need it. You're taking your pre-natals, right? - Yeah. - Good. Let's give her a listen, shall we? Okay. - Um... Dr. Fern? Dr. Fern, is there something wrong with the baby's heartbeat? What're you? Doctor? Dr. Fern, are you all right? What're you... Dr. Fern? - All hail the Lilith. Long live the first mother. Oh my God! Dr. Fern! Ah! Dr. Fern! - "Hail Lilith. "Long live the first mother." What does that mean? - How should I know? - You feeling okay, Ms. Robins? - I just wanna go home. - Listen, we wanna get you out of here as soon as we can. We need to make sure we don't miss anything. So let's just go over it one last time, okay? - Come on, again? I've already told you everything 10 times. - We just need to make sure that we don't miss anything for the record. Well I told you everything. - You said Dr. Fern was fine during the appointment until the very end. Then he started acting weird. - Weird how? - Just like I told you, he got all quiet and he... He wouldn't look at me. And then he started like scribbling really hard in his notebook. He was acting like a robot. - Like a robot? - I don't think he was a robot, okay, I think he was acting like a robot. He was stiff, I don't know how else to say it. He was acting odd, creepy. Weird? - Was it out of the blue or was there, was there a trigger? What set him off? - I don't know, I don't know what set him off. - Kinda looks like you just thought of something there. - No, I don't know, I don't know what set him off. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. - All right. So what then? Then he just stabbed himself. - Four times in the neck. - I don't know how many times he stabbed himself, okay? - But he did all the stabbing. - Yes! He did this to himself. - And that blood is? - This? It's from a nose bleed. Look, I swear I never touched him. - So why did he do that? - God. - We talked to his coworkers, his girlfriend, none of them believe it was suicide. Apparently, he was a happy guy. Why off himself? - How should I know? I don't know! He just... - Who kills themself with a pen to the jugular? Who does that? Well, Dr. Noah Fern for one. - So you're buying it? - Kwan, you made detective two years ago. I'm going on 20 years. I guarantee you'll see plenty of suicides weirder than this one. - Everyone said he was a happy guy. - Everyone always says he was a happy guy. Nobody wants to admit they missed the warning signs. And the scene backs her up. There's no way she stabbed him, put the pen in his hand without getting any blood on her and fingerprints all over him, there's no way. - But there is blood on her. You really believe that's a nose bleed? - That's what it looks like to me. - Let's just wait for forensics to tell us what they find out. - We can't hold her that long. She's pregnant, for Christ's sake. Be lucky if she doesn't sue as is. Nah. The call on the field is good, suicide. Let's go get a beer. - They can't just do this, you know. They can't just arrest you without letting you call somebody! - Look, I wasn't arrested, okay? They just held me for questioning. - Well they shouldn't be able to do that either. No, they shouldn't be able to just hold anybody, much less, a traumatized pregnant lady! - I'm okay. I'll be okay. Look, I'm just really tired and I kinda just wanna go home. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I should've been there. I should've been there with you. Never let you go in there alone. None of this would've happened. It's okay. Hey. We're okay. We're okay. - Hey, you want some more noodles? Okay. Come on, Rach, you gotta eat something. Especially because you are not just eating for you now. You are eating for two. - Of course. I almost forgot. Mmmm. Mmmm, this is so good. - Hey. I'm not trying to fight with you. You know, I just need you to take care of yourself. Not to mention, the baby-- - The baby, I know. Yeah, I know. You gotta take care of the baby. I got it. I'm sorry. You're right. I'll eat, okay? See, see? I'm eating. Thank you. Oh, don't forget, we have that new O.B. tomorrow. We should probably leave around 10. Oh, hey. I know that it's probably weird, especially so soon after what happened. - Why do you think he did it? What do you mean? - I mean, Dr. Fern. Like, why do you think that he did that in front of me? You know, like-- - Rach. I really hate to see you tormenting yourself like this. - So what, I'm just supposed to like forget it? I'm sorry, I can't, I can't stop seeing it. You know? - I know. I know. And, look, I can't even begin to imagine how horrible it was for you. But I just don't think it's a great idea, or healthy for that matter, to keep dwelling on it like this. - Oh, that's what it is, right? I'm boring you. Okay. - Come on, that's not what I said. - No but it is what you meant, right? See, you just want me to shut up and stop complaining. Well guess what, I get to complain all I want to, you know why? Because I am going through hell to give you this baby. So you, you don't have to do shit. You don't have to sacrifice shit! - Wow, you know what? I'm not doing this with you. Not tonight, Rach. - Really? You're just gonna get up and walk away? No, you know what, you don't! Don't walk away from me like that! - "Give me this baby." - Yeah. - "Give me this baby?" Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought you were doing this for us. Rach, do you have any idea how jealous I am of you? - Ugh. - Do you have any idea how much I wish that I'm the one that could be doing this. - Spoken with the ease of someone who isn't pregnant! - That's not fair. My career is our primary source of income-- - Which you keep reminding me all the time! - And we talked about this! - I know. I know, I know, I know. You're right, you're right. I am, I'm doing this for... For us, you know, I... I'm glad we're doing it, I am. It just, before I knew how hard it was really gonna be-- - Which is why I've been trying to be there for you! And this entire time, what do you think I'm doing? I just want us to be happy. - Wait. - Rachel, what was that? Did she just kick? Can I feel? Oh my god. - Wait, wait, wait. - Why, what's? - I just-- - What's wrong? Are you okay? - Maybe not right now. - But can I just? Let me-- - Don't! I'm sorry, I didn't... - Wow. What is going on with you? - I know you're gonna think I'm crazy, and maybe I am. I can't stop feeling like something is wrong with this pregnancy. - What do you mean, Rachel? - I don't know. It's just... wrong. I feel like I'm cursed, you know? - You're not cursed, Rachel. - Listen, listen, Dr. Fern only started acting weird after he heard the heartbeat of the baby. Okay, it was the same thing at the guy, with the guy at the coffee shop, you know? Just listen to me! What if, what if, what if... What if it's not my mom? - Wait, whoa! Let me stop you right there. Are you actually trying to tell me that you won't let me feel our daughter kick for the first time because you think that your uterus is haunted? - So you do think I'm crazy. - No, Rachel, let's clear this up right now. Because if it is, let me be clear in what I am saying to you because mine is actually coming from love and concern. You need to get your shit together. - Excuse me? - Yes, Rachel, I said that. Look, I am not gonna pretend that I know everything you're going through but you need to stop acting like I have not been here with you this entire time. Which is why I have to be honest with you and tell you that this, all of it, is delusional. There's nothing wrong with our baby. - Don't gaslight me, I know what's happening! - I'm not gaslighting you. I am just trying to keep you here in reality. - The sonogram had a face! - It was an optical illusion and a coincidence just like I have said every time! Jesus, Rachel, I just, I need you here on earth with me. Both of us do. - I'm sorry. It's me, it's me. It's me, I'm sorry. I just... I... I don't know what's happening to me. - And that's when Amber suggested you try seeing a therapist? - Yeah. And she was right, I was just, I just drag my heels about it, you know? - It's not easy to ask for help. I think you're doing a great job coming here on a regular basis. So now that time has passed, what are your thoughts about all this? - I just freaked out. You know, I got in my head and... Look, I know nothing is wrong with the baby. - You mentioned early on that you saw your mother's face in the ultrasound photo. What was your mother like? - My mom was the best. We were real close. She was my best friend. We did everything together, and now she's just... Gone. - It sounds like she was a positive force for you. - Yeah. Huge. - Was she ever a negative force? - No, no, she was great. - Never? - Honestly, she was a great mom. Did she get along with Amber? - Oh, sure. You know, they weren't super tight or anything but, yeah, they got along, there's no problems. How about the rest of your family? - There is no rest of the family. My mom's family was abusive to her, so she ran away and she never saw them again and I never knew my dad. So there was no dad side of the family. - Oh. That must've been difficult. Obviously, we need to talk about all of this a lot more before I'd feel confident saying anything concrete, but it seems like you are... All hail the Lilith. Long live the first mother. - What did you say? - I was just saying we're out of time for today. But I think it's really positive for you to keep talking about all this. I feel like you should come back next week for another session. Is that okay? For thousands of years, people have told stories about Lilith. She appears in the mythology of almost every ancient culture. Some say she is the first vampire. Some say she is a succubus. Some say she was the first woman, before Eve, cast out of Eden after refusing to submit to Adam. Others, like members of the Children of Lilith death cult believe she is the wife of Satan. - I believed it. We all believed it. Hell, I think even Mother Lilith, whoever she really was, I think she actually believed it herself. She convinced us she was thousands of years old. That she was reborn into a new body every 66 years and six months. She told us if we devoted ourselves to her and her husband, the Dark Lord would adopt us and give us places of honor in the underworld. She told us we would be princes and princesses of hell. People ask me, how can you believe that stuff? How dumb can you be? I guess the answer is really fucking dumb. Because I swallowed it, hook, line and sinker. I was just a kid when I met Mother Lilith. Lost, looking for somebody to help me make sense of all of the fucked up shit that happened to me when I was a kid. She was really persuasive. She had this way of just getting into your head, making you think a certain way, do a certain thing. Sometimes she didn't even need to say it. She could just stare into your eyes and put an idea into your head. Was she hypnotizing her followers? Brainwashing them? Seducing them? It depends who tells the story. But every version ends the same, with Mother Lilith leading her so-called children in ritual suicide. On June 21, 1988, at the Nevada Ranch that the locals refer to, in hushed tones, as the commune, Mother Lilith lead her 46 followers where they simultaneously cut their own throats. All but one perished. - I remember waking up in an ambulance thinking I was dead, being transported to the morgue or something. And when I figured out I was actually still alive, I was heartbroken. It was a long road to recovery for John Fletcher Jr, physically and psychologically, but after 30 years he finally considers himself to be a happy, healthy person. Still, it seems he hasn't been able to completely move on. - When the FBI was done with the place, they put it up for auction. I had just signed this big book deal, so I bought it. At first, it was just a place to live. I felt weird sleeping anywhere else. It wasn't around, till around 2003 or so, that I opened the museum, started doing the ghost tours. This is my museum area. Oh, this? This was taken six weeks before the ritual. That's me standing right next to Mother Lilith. Ah, it was an amazing day, I remember this day. We had no idea what was coming. - Wait. Mom? Standing right next to Mother Lilith. Ah, it was... Home! An amazing-- - Hi. - Oh. How are my girls? - Oh, you know, we're okay, how was your shoot? - Well, they dressed me like a hipster psychic, so there's that. But everyone on set says hi. They really miss you. - Aw, that's sweet. - How was therapy? - Yeah, it was good, I think it helped. Really? - Mm-hmm. - Well I wanna hear all about it. I mean, obviously, if you wanna talk about it. - Sure. - Okay, I will go get showered and then you and I can order some sushi. I am, oh, I'm sorry. No sushi for you. How about we have some Thai? Think about it. - Hi. - Yes, come in. - I'm Rachel. - Sit. You want to know about baby? - Yes. - You must pay first. Sometimes people don't pay. Now you must pay first. - How much is it? - 100 dollar, cash only. I will only say once, I am, how you say, the real deal. Sometimes people don't pay because they don't believe what they hear. Sometimes they don't pay because they do no want to believe. Think hard before I take your money and maybe you will not like what I say. - Okay. Okay, okay. I understand. - Good, then we begin. Hands. Sorry? - Give me hands. Oh. - Close eyes. Your baby is girl, yes? - Yes. - And you want to know if baby is good girl or not-so-good girl. - I guess so, I just feel like there's something that-- Let me listen. You already choose name, I hear a name. Sarah. Is this for baby? - Yes, how do you know that? - This was your mother's name and now you have chosen it for baby? - How do you know that? - You came because I know these things. Just like I know that Sarah is good girl, good, healthy girl. But this other one, not so good. - Excuse me? Other one? There's not twins, it's just the one. I've had two doctors confirm that it's not-- - Not another baby, another spirit inside there with her. Babcia. - Babcia? - Grandmother. You feel her, I know. Don't be scared. I told you, I'm real deal, I know these things. - Yes. Yes, I feel her. - Sometimes when a mother dies with no grandchildren, her dusza, her soul, won't leave. Her spirit stays with us until her son or daughter has a baby. Only then will she move on. - Can you speak to her? - I can speak, I cannot make her speak back. You have message? - Yes. Please tell her that I love her so much and I miss her and I wish that she was here when the baby-- - She already knows these things, what is message? Tell her to stop. Whatever she's doing, whatever this is, people are getting hurt and I'm scared. - Babcia. She says she is not protecting your baby, she says she is protecting her new skóra, her new skin. - What's that, what the hell does that mean? - It means she is no babcia after all. She is demon, an evil spirit with no body. She waits to be reborn inside your baby's skin. - No, no, it can't be a demon, it can't-- - Don't worry, I will evict her. I am as I say, real deal. I will help. - Please. Are you okay? - She won't let go! She's too strong! You must cut her out! You must get rid of her before she is reborn or she will... - No. No. I can't. Why are you doing this to me? - Rach? Rach! Oh my god. Rach, what happened? - Don't. - Rach! Hey. Rachel, please, whatever it is, just, we can figure it out together. Please talk to me. - I can't. - Rachel. - You don't believe me. - I will believe you. Look, I don't care if you tell me you were abducted by aliens, okay? Please, just talk to me. - I don't know what happened. I ran, I don't even remember driving home. - Look, it's... I'm just glad that you're okay. - God, I didn't even try to help her. - Hey. That is completely understandable. Look, you were in shock. But I do think that we need to call the cops now. We'll tell them that she had a seizure or a heart attack or something and that you panicked, so you ran. - No, Amber, we can't call the police. - We have to call the police, Rachel. - No, even if they don't arrest me, they're gonna keep me there forever for questioning, you know that. Look, Madame Rose said the only way to stop the demon was to get rid of it before the baby's born. - Right. The demon. - I know you think I'm crazy. But you don't have to make fun of me. - I am not making fun of you. I am trying to wrap my head around this whole thing. Come on, you have to admit that this is a lot. Okay, fine. How did she say that we get rid of the demon? - She said we gotta cut it out. - Well that is just not happening, Rachel. - Do you think that I want that? I mean, after everything that I've been through. That is why we can't waste time going to the cops. All right, we gotta figure out some other way to get rid of this thing and keep it from taking over our baby. - Okay. How do we get started? Do we seen an exorcist or something? - My mom escaped a satanic suicide cult, not the Catholic Church. I don't think and exorcist is gonna be any help. Do you remember that documentary I told you about? There was that guy, he survived. - Yeah. - He survived it. He's still there. If anybody knows how to stop this from happening, it's gonna be him. - Okay. Okay, so we'll give him a call. - No, look, I did that, I tried that. As soon as I learned about him, I left him a message. I sent him an email, he didn't return anything. - Well then we will go see him. - Really? - Yeah. Look, Rach, if this is what you need to do to fix this, then that is what we're gonna do. Okay, I'm in. I'm in. I love you. - I love you so much. - Hey, look, why don't you finish up in here and I will pack us a bag. - Okay. - And we'll take off as soon as you're done. All right. - Thank you. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Okay, so we're gonna get on the Five heading north. North, got it. - Hey. Thank you for doing this. Even if you are just humoring me. - Rach, I love you, and so whatever you need, okay? But there is something that I wanna show you first. - What? Like a surprise or... - Yeah, like a surprise. - This is... in a parking garage? - No. No. Come on. - It's really cool of you to make a plan for us to like reconnect. I'm kinda hoping it's the churro spot you were telling me about. Or ice cream, I love ice cream. Hot chocolate, French vanilla ice cream. - Anything you want. - Yeah. Wait. What is this? - Rachel, hello. I'm Dr. Simmons. I'm a mental health professional here at the Haven Wellness Center. We're a private mental health clinic. - Are you having me committed? - Rach. - What? - You didn't give me a choice. Gentlemen. Escort her inside. - What're you doing? No, no, no, no, no! No! Did your family put you up to this? Let me, stop it! Is this your brother? Amber! Don't do this! - Don't worry. - Amber! - She'll be fine. I know how difficult this must be on you. But just know, you're doing the right thing. - Doesn't feel like the right thing. - Fellas. Fellas, fellas. - Get off me! - Fellas, it's fine, it's fine, we're talking. - What is this? Get-- - We're talking. Hey. - Treating my like an animal! - Hi, Rachel, Rachel. Rachel. I'm Dr. Simmons. I want you to know these men-- - Get off! - These men are not gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm your doctor, do you understand? I'm on your side. - You think I'm nuts. - No, no, I don't. I don't think you're nuts, I don't think anyone's nuts. That's why I got into mental health to begin with. Thanks, guys. Please. Have a seat. - I don't need a doctor. - Oh. What do you need? You don't wanna talk? All right. I'll tell you what I need. I need to give you a physical and I need to check the baby's vitals real quick and then we can get you settled in your room and you can decompress a little. Okay? - No. The last doctor who did that, he-- - No, no. Amber told us all about Dr. Fern and I understand your concern. But I'm willing to risk it. Like I said, I'm your doctor and I'm going to do whatever I need to do to make sure you're healthy, right? - Look, if you listen to the baby's heartbeat, something terrible is going to happen. I don't know, you just trust me, you can't. - Oh but I can. You're here in what's called an involuntary hold. You gave your wife medical power of attorney and she's concerned about your mental state, and frankly, darling, so am I. So, will you let me do what I need to do or are we going to make this into a thing? - Go fuck yourself. - Oh no. That kind of language isn't going to help us. This will only take a second. Almost done now. Deep breath in. Exhale. And I'm not feeling any urges to kill myself. Very good. Now, was that so bad? - Think I got something. This old lady, Rose Kocinski, the psychic at that shopping center with the good burritos. Someone found her dead. Looks like she died of an aneurysm, but M.E. says somebody crushed every bone in this poor woman's hands. - And you thought I'd be interested in this, why? - Because guess who's on the shopping plaza's security tape leaving her place less than an hour before her body was found? - I'm sorry. I'm just so sorry. This whole thing is my fault. I can't believe I got so fucking crazy. - You're not crazy, Rach. - Amber, look at what I made you do to me. - Okay, but look, it's not... You're not crazy, you're just, I don't know, just going through something. - Yeah but that's no excuse. You know, look at the position I put us in. - Hey, look, the main thing is, you're getting help and I think that that's really brave. - Don't, don't, don't do that, don't patronize me. I made such a scene in front of that doctor that I might never get out of here. You know, and what happens-- - Hey. - If I go into labor here? - No. No. - Are they gonna take the baby? - No. No, no, no, come here. I am not going to let any of that happen, Rach. I'll be right here with you. - Dr. Simmons, there are two detectives here who would like to speak to Rachel Robins. - Excuse me! I don't think so! You two don't get to talk to her. No way. - What? Who are you? - I think she's the wife. - Yes, I'm her wife. - Nice, good to meet you. - Oh, save it. Look, she's been through enough and she answered all your questions. So now just let her rest. - Oh, you're talking about the doctor guy? Stabbed himself in the neck? - You're right. She's answered all our questions about that. But now we have questions about the dead psychic. - I'm sorry. What do you mean? - You don't know about that, do you? - No. But what I do now is that you need to get a warrant to talk to her. - We actually don't. Not to talk to her. If the doctor says she can talk, she can talk. - Gentlemen. Hello. Dr. Roy Simmons. You're here for Rachel Robins. - That's right. - That's fine. - Wait, what? No! No! Fine. But I'm calling our lawyer and the two of you aren't gonna say a word to her till he gets here. - I'm sorry, guys, I've gotta get back to work. You'll have someone page me when you've sorted all of this out. And then we're going to take five more deep breaths. In and out. In and out. In and out. One more. And breath out. - Come with me. - Is everything okay? - Everything's fine. - I don't... Mom, Mom, I don't know. Yeah, Gary's on his way right now. - Amber! Amber! Mom? Mom, I gotta call you back! Rachel! - Amber! - Rachel! - Amber! - Shit! - Wait, where are you taking me? Why are we outside? Slow down, I can't go that fast. - Rachel! - Get in. - Please don't do this. - Quiet. Run, and your wife dies. Rachel! Rachel! - You hear that? - Parking garage. - Let's go! Rachel! - Rachel, stop! - Go, go, go, go, go! Call it in! Are you okay? - Definitely not okay! You believe me now? - What happened? - Are you gonna call it in? What the hell are you doing? He's dead. - So what? You gotta call it in if we wanna catch them. Whatever. I got the plates, I'll do it. - Hang up the phone. - What? - Hang up the phone now! - Peters, what the fuck? - Now! You can't stop her. No one can. - Peters? I don't know what's going on here but we can talk about it. - All hail the Lilith. - Peters, what're you doing, man? - Long live the first mother. What're you doing? Don't do it! Don't! Peters! What're you doing? Talk to me, partner, talk to me! Oh, fuck! Peters! What the fuck, man? Hey! You fucking idiot, what're you doing? Hey, stay with me. Stay with me, Peters! Peters, you're all right. Hey, can someone fucking get me some help? We close at 6:30. You have to come back tomorrow. - We're not here for the tour. - Please, we need your help. So I thought if anyone knew how to stop this thing, it would be you. I know, I know it sounds insane. But please, we're running out of time. - I'm gonna stop you right there, young lady. I don't know what kind of idiot you think I am but you picked the wrong guy for your prank. Now get out of here, both of you, before I call the cops. - No, no, my mom's name was Sarah, okay? She ran away in 1988. - I don't know any Sarah! - Okay, well then who's that in the photo with you? - That's Lilian. - Look. Lilian. Her name's Sarah. - Rach, maybe... I don't know, maybe she changed her name after she escaped from the cult. - That's your mother? And you think she's coming back to life in your unborn baby? - Yep. That about sums it up. - I need a drink. Either of you need a drink? - Yes, please. - When I got back, Peters told me the doctor was dead. He hadn't called it in so, I took out my cellphone to do it. That's when he drew his side arm and told me to hang up. - What'd you do? - I hung up. And then? - Then I tried talking to him. Tried figuring out what the hell was going on but... He just ignored me. - Did he say anything else? - Told me I couldn't stop her. - Interesting. Who's her? - I don't know. - Was that all? - No. He said, "All hail Lilith. "Long live the first mother." - What the hell does that mean? - How the fuck should I know? - There's something you need to understand. That's not your mother in there. That's your grandmother. It's Mother Lilith. Excuse me? - You mean the cult lady. - Oh, you didn't know? We all called ourselves her children but Lilian was her actual daughter. - The psychic kept saying "grandmother." I thought she was talking about my mother, the baby's grandma, I know she was... She was talking about my grandmother. - She was the one that was meant to be reborn. Not your mother. We were all meant to kill ourselves to earn a place in hell as royalty. Son and daughters of Satan. But mother Lilith was meant to be reborn so she could continue adopting generations of children for the Dark Lord. But just before the ritual, your mother ran away. Mother Lilith was furious. She still had to kill herself to escort us to our new father. But... Without your mother there, there was no baby. So she just had to wait for her granddaughter to have a daughter. - You're telling me I'm giving birth to the devil's wife and that my mom is just-- - Dead. - Okay, okay. So, even if our baby is possessed by this Lilith instead of your mom, that doesn't tell us what we came here to find out. Which is how do we get rid of her? - You can't. Nothing will stop her. And even if there was something, I wouldn't tell you. What kind of a son would I be if I did that? - What? - You enjoying that drink? - Amber? Amber! Amber, Amber! Oh god, Amber! What the hell did you put in that? - Don't worry, there's nothing in yours. She'll be fine. As long as you follow instructions, that is. But if you don't follow instructions, she's going to get hurt. Got it? - Amber? Amber? - You know, I've waited a very long time for you. There were some years, I admit, that I had my doubts. But Mother Lilith always said you would come. And here you are now. It's an honor to meet you, really. - If you've been waiting or me, then you never tried to kill yourself. - Of course not. I was the only one Mother Lilith could trust to stay behind. Keep the homestead going. You know that doctor who tried to abduct you? She was gonna have him bring you here. And then you two escaped and you came here all on your own. All the way up here for help. - Please, you don't have to do this. You really don't have to do this. Hey, don't you touch her! Oh honey, I'm so sorry! Please don't touch me, please. - Rach? - Amber. Don't touch me, no! - Get away from her! Get away from her! Don't touch her! Don't touch her! - You don't have to do this! Please, stop. Please. - Rachel. - Please, you don't have to do this, please. Please. Please. - Don't touch her! Get away from her! - Oh! Oh, oh! There she is. There she is! All hail the Lilith. Oh! Long live the first mother. - No! No! - No. No word yet. There will be a ruling anytime soon. Doesn't look good. I.A. are fuckers. You know what, I gotta go. I'll keep you posted. Yeah. - Knock, knock! Are we decent? How're we feeling? I said, how are we feeling? About the same, huh? What do you want for lunch? Rachel, look at me! You know, there are some sharp tools in the barn out there. Maybe you should start following instructions before Mother Lilith makes your wife put out one of those pretty little eyes! I'm sick of this attitude. I know you don't wanna be here. But this is where you are. So you really should make the most of it. - Make the most of it. - Look, Lilith is coming whether you want her to or not and you will be her mother. Whether you want to be or not. And that position comes with some impressive perks. You know, you could have a really sweet life here if you just gave up the "fuck yous." Now what do you want for lunch? - You know... I think I'll... Oh! - Rachel? Rachel? - Oh, it's happening! - Okay, it's okay. It's okay. Hey! - Oh, you! Don't you open that door! - No one move! Let me see your hands! Up! - Is there anyone else in here? - My wife is in the barn. - Good because I have plenty of questions for the both of you. I said hands! Keep them up! - I will tell you everything but first you've gotta get me out of here and away from him. He's been holding me captive this entire time. - What, she's crazy! Her and her crazy wife kidnapped me, drugged me, dragged me out-- - Hey, shut up, both of you! - Her and her crazy wife! - I said, shut up! Here's what's gonna happen. Both of you are gonna come outside with me nice and slow. We're gonna go find your wife and then I'm gonna take all three of you in and you all can tell me what's going on. Let's go! Door! - I can explain if you just let me explain. - One hand! - Let me talk to you without him. - I said move! Slowly. Don't get too close. - Please. Don't get too close! - I didn't do anything to your partner. - Hands up! - Watch out! No. - I told you her wife was crazy. Oh come on, you think I'm gonna fall for that again? - Shoot him! Amber, shoot the fucker! - Amber. Shoot him, Amber! Shoot the fucker! - It's okay, Amber. It's okay, Amber, calm down. Calm down, you're gonna be okay. You don't wanna shot me. You don't wanna shoot me, Amber. Don't, look at me, look at me, Amber. Look at me. You don't wanna shoot me. Okay? - It's time. Get rid of him. I'll take her to the barn to get ready. - Amber. Amber. Please. Amber. You don't have to do this. Please, please, I know that you're in there somewhere. Please. Amber. Amber. Amber, please. I can't do this alone. Please, please, I need you, I need you. I can't do this on my own. I can't do this on my own. - Rachel? Rachel? Rachel, Rachel, Rachel. Okay, okay, okay, I'm here. I am here with you. Hey, hey, look at me, look at me. Look at me, I'm here, I'm here. I am right here. - Oh, I burn so much! - I know, I know. - I don't know what to do! - Breathe, breathe. Baby, breathe. - Welcome home, Mother. - Just breathe, baby. I am right here with you, I'm not going anywhere. I'm sorry, just breathe. I'm here-- - We're getting closer. - Amber. Mom. - It's okay, baby. Don't worry, I'm here. - Why didn't you ever tell me? - I'm sorry. I thought I'd saved you. I thought you were safe. - That was you? It was really you in my dream, you were trying to warn me. - Your grandmother, she didn't want me communicating with you and she's stronger than I am. But she's distracted now, so I'm here. - But you're head. - Sweetie. Doesn't matter if I'm dead, I'll always be with you. - I don't know what to do, Momma. - What do you mean? - I don't think I could stop her. - Well, maybe not, but you don't have to do it on her terms. You're her mother. You make the rules. - They said if I did anything, he'd hurt Amber. - They're gonna hurt her anyway. How do you think this ritual ends? Your grandmother cut her throat when she left this world. Someone has to do the same to bring her back. - Cut her throat? - I love you, baby. Momma, don't go! Rachel, Rachel. Rachel, look. - Listen. Oh, listen to me. They're gonna kill you. You've got to get out of here. - I can't, I can't, Rachel, I can't! And even if I could, I'm not leaving you! - Listen to me. I have a plan. - Get off her! It's okay. You're okay. Don't touch me, get off me! It's okay. It's okay! - Get off me! - It's okay, it's okay! - Get off me, get off me! - It's okay! - Rachel, listen to me, you have to take this. When your next contraction comes, she won't make me give it back! You have to take it! You! Where is the key? Where? - Amber! - You piece of shit! - No! - Rachel, I will be back, I promise! I love you! - I love you. Don't. Don't you fucking touch me! Back off! - You broke my leg! - Shut up! The next contraction I have, my finger is gonna squeeze this trigger whether I want it to or not, unless we can make a deal. - Deal? There's no deal. - Shut up! I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to her. - Well she's not gonna listen to you! - I said be quiet, JoNoah! I'm listening. - Let Amber go. Let her go. I will cooperate. I will take care of you. I will be your mom. The best mom that you could ever have hoped for. Just please let her go. Please. - I'm afraid that's not possible. In order for me to come back, another must-- - Has to take your place, I know. Doesn't have to be her. Doesn't have to be. Let it be him. - Me? That's ridiculous. Mother Lilith needs-- - I told you to be quiet, JoNoah! I accept. - Wha... Now drop the gun. - You think I trust you? - Mother, no. You can't make me take your place. You won't be able to escort me to my new father. He won't know who I am! Yes he will. He will know how loyal you served me. And you, you will join your brothers and your sisters at the Dark Lord's side. - Yes, Mother. - When your next contraction hits, tell her to run. But if I let her go and she comes back, she's mine. - Rachel. - Amber! - Rachel! - You have to go! - Rachel. - Go, go, go! You have to go! You can't be here, you need to go! Go! Go! - All hail the Lilith! Long live the first mother. I love you, Mother. - This is it. Wow. This place is beautiful. Rachel? I'm out here. It's okay. Go to sleep, baby. - I brought someone to say hi to baby Lilith. If it's okay with you, he's gonna have dinner with us and spend the night. He said that he has lots of friends that will be coming this way soon. - Well they, of course, are all welcome. - Wow, thank you. Seriously. That's very generous. - Don't thank me. Thank Lilith. - Uh... Sure. Thanks, Lilith. Hi, angel. Yeah. Hi, angel. - She's got it. Do you wanna hold her? - Uh... I'm not... Keep looking in her eyes. Hold her tight, hold her tight and keep bouncing.
