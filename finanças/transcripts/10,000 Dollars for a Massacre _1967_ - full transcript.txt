Ah, the sea, my friend. The sea is truly marvelous. But it doesn't interest you. You're only interested, in heaven, right? * 10,000 DOLLARS BLOOD MONEY * As soon as a bounty raises, the jackals arrive. Save me your speech, Joe. This man cleanses the whole country from carrion all on his own. The jackals and vultures do the same. I don't find them friendly though. This one's done, you can pay me. You'll be rich, Django. I can see, you're serious. We're worried about this one, too. Why don't you take care of him? Because it's not my price. However, I trust Manuel. He'll do better. What do you want? Beat it! The sir Mendossa doesn't want any vagabonds on his farm. Do you remember me, Mendossa? Manuel. Yes, Manuel. I came back to collect my debts. Manuel tou don't want to kill me, do you? I can give you a lot of money. Because of you... I was in jail for four years. Cisco, you tell him! What's the use of killing me? Just tell him! I'll give you what you want. All I have. What might be the price... of four years of my life, Mendossa? Tell me a number! Any number! What's the name... of your daughter? Dolores? No! No! My daughter doesn't. No! No! No, no... I beg you, no! No, no, no! Why? Am I not good enough for you? But don't be afraid. I won't marry her. Take the farm. You can take everything! But she no! I ask, Manuel, I beg you She's just a child. She's all I have. Where? Where is she? Bring her to me! No... no! Manuel, leave her alone! I'm begging you! No! Stop, Manuel! Take him away, Cisco! Oh!... And let him live... so he will remember this day. Who's there? Are you Fidelio, the photographer? Yes, Sir! Very good! A nice photo in large format that will drive the women insane! Instead of the stick you need a rifle. To big game hunt. Exactly! Great! Just a second, maybe it's better without the hat... Yes, you're perfect. Stand still. One step back! But I don't want to have my picture taken! What? What else do you want then? I came looking for Django, the bounty hunter. And why are you looking right here? Because I was told that you're his friend. His friend! That depends. Fidelio can be everyone's friend, Sir. And what is it about? About him! You must help me, he kidnapped my daughter. I'll add 500 dollars to the bounty... if Django brings back my Dolores! You have a cheap daughter. Hey! Are you Django? Sure. 1,000! 1,000 dollars more. 1,500! At least say something! 1,500 dollars plus 3,000 bounty makes 4,500 dollars! You're a dirty tramp, a traitor, a spy... but you have an ugly vice: Stinginess. Let's say 2,000 dollars. Not one more! May I? Listen, why do you want to get killed by a man in drawers? That's dubious. What a cheapskate. Did you hear that? I bet, for 2,000 dollars you were supposed to bring the dower... for his daughter, as well. Well, Fidelio... Even in here you don't have time for yourself anymore. Maybe this will calm you down! Look at this blondie! A cute little thing, right? It's Scarf face's girl. Since yesterday... she's in Mijanou's saloon. Her room is just above the saloon. What if the scarf guy still a man... he'll be in that room tonight for sure. No... stop it. Now that's enough, come on. That tickles! No, stop. No... How beautiful you are. Damn! That's Django! Oh!... Goodbye, bounty. Who am I going to tell now... that this used to be Scarf face? As you can see... I always go by the rules. Django, but follow them completely You have to leave your weapons at the wardrobe. I'd feel better if you hunted somewhere else. If there is no Sheriff, the soldiers only show up to bury the bodies. Hey friend! We're playing with death. Why don't you join us and be the fourth men? Bring something to drink to this table. They say you killed Scarf face. As it's written in the bible: "Ashes to ashes and dust to dust!" Now you'll need an eyewitness to collect the bounty. In his condition, I don't think they'll believe you. Come on! It's your turn. The game starts to get interesting. Hey how are you!... Yesterday, it was 3,000 for you. Who cares? There's always someone who'd like to build... a nice ranch for 3,000 dollars. Or none. Maybe. You're just like a ranch that's walking around... and waits for someone to snatch it. 500. You know, the 3,000's if someone's not a total loser, he'll blow them all away. The 3,000's? But yes. Villagers, incapable accidental criminals... little boys. It starts to get difficult with 5,000, that's it! But you can still manage that. And if you... end up with the ones for 6,000 to 8,000 dollars... Yes, go ahead. You'll lose your skin... for 90 percent. And you? At which sum do you start? 10,000 minimum. I see. Show your cards. A full with noners. Not enough. Full with kings. No, sorry. Four aces. It's really late already. Gentlemen, I'm leaving you now. Good evening. One with a 3,000 dollar bounty... is not even capable of catching a cardsharper. Buddy! You were right. He cheated. Look. That's your share. Dirty carrion! Calm down, Mijanou. You know, I hate hysterical women. I discredited your saloon a little. But a woman like you... doesn't run out of opportunities. Not a even a dog will put a foot in here anymore. Beat it, get out! It's unnecessary to follow him. He's done for. Tomorrow morning, a bunch of vultures will meet at his corpse for breakfast. Aw, come on, Archibaldo. This water's dirty. You can drink at home. Come, Fidelio! Hang on!... Archibaldo speaks! No time to lose, Fidelio. For God's sake! Who did that to you? Scarf face! And I've already prepared... a casket for him... Hurry up, Fidelio. Or you'll have to put me in the casket. Come on!... Archibaldo, we're taking a different way. There are jackals on this one. Go, go!... Come on. Go!... Hey! Stop for a second. Did you meet somebody here? No! Just ravens... and vultures. Then beat it! I could get nervous. "WANTED $ 5000 DEAD OR ALIVE" You're really hurrying up, Manuel. Bye, Mijanou. Don't worry about it. Quite dead here. Don't walk away and don't say nothing, Mijanou. I think I do understand what's going on. Mijanou, wait a minute! Someone on my cart is in desperate need for a good bed. Take him somewhere else. I don't take guests anymore. Don't you want to know who it is? It's Django! He's wounded. And if he won't find a bed, he's going to die, that poor guy. Then let him die. Keep your head up, it's all good now. The worst part is over. And maybe you'll make it. There, look at him, just another hero. They're all the same. They kill and kill... but when it comes to dying... You're scared like everyone else. Right, gunslinger? Hey, young man! What are you doing with my foot in your hand? Your face implies you're not experienced in handling a woman. Where's Fidelio? He went to take Mendossa. He's quite sure that you changed your mind... about a certain business. I've changed my mind about a lot of things. Help me, Mijanou... No, move slowly, gunslinger. I'm no flesh for your teeth. What do you think I fought for all of those years, huh? To end up in the arms of a man like you? I'm sick of living with these cattle drovers. It came the way it came, and it's better like that. But the next stagecoach that goes by, is mine. I won't miss it. I'm going to San Francisco, that's a real city. I'll be able to dress properly and on Sundays... I'll go for a walk with one of those fancy stylish hats. And you? What keeps you from kissing me? Or do you have water in your veins? I'll come with you, Mijanou. Come on, come on, come on! Here we are. This is where he's staying. And now, let's talk business. 50 dollars, or nothing will happen. And let me do the talking. I know how to handle that guy. Listen, Django. Sir Mendossa changed his mind. That poor man suffers quite a lot from the destiny of his daughter Dolores. 2,000 for Manuel and another 3,000 if you bring me Dolores as well. This is too much, 5,000 plus 5,000 bounty, that's a total of 10,000 dollars! That's your price. Yes. That's my price. Even for a dirty tramp like you. Mijanou! Mijanou! Beat it! Beat it or I'll shoot you like a dog! I don't want you near me anymore. Go away from here! A dirty no-good, that's what you are! Go to your Manuel! I must have been an idiot to believe you. But you are and will always be a wolf. Listen, Mijanou. Just now I can't pass on 10,000 dollars. And I can't pass on you right now. Just think about it, Mijanou. It's 10,000 dollars. What could be the price of a saloon in San Francisco? I want you to have the most beautiful saloon in the whole city. It's okay. Go and get yourself killed if it's so important to you. As for me... The next stagecoach will arrvive in six days. In six days. Strange weather, photographer. Well. There's a thunderstorm coming up. Is there a bounty on your head, too? So far, I haven't seen anyone around here... who'd be able to collect it. Did you really take a proper look, my friend? Now you listen to me. If I tell them in here who you are, they will rip you apart... to find out where Manuel is. What do you think? So? So what? You better tell me and save your skin. I don't know anything. Fine. Manuel is in Tampa... the abandoned village. Your father and the rest, of the pack are also there. And now, my goose is cooked. Because if he finds out that I told you... he'll skin me alive. That's for sure. Indeed, we all have to die sooner or later. It's better to have friends helping you out with it. Nice, isn't it? It costs 100 dollars, but is worth every single one. That's an excellent deal! Yes... but... don't you have something more expensive? You have an extraordinary taste. Right, young man? Wait here. The latest models just arrived from Boston. I'll unpack them immediately. All that. Well, Seven Dollars! Will this soup ever be ready? Almost done! Are you in? I pass. I go with it. Two aces. Damn, two queens. Quiet, old hag! Well aimed, right? I wouldn't say so. Wait. Who are you? Get out! Your pistol draws a little to the left. Fortunately. Otherwise, you would have dried that crone up. You missed again. I don't like ghosts. I want to know who you are! You always ask that after you shot, don't you? Of course! You see these? All good folks who I asked afterwards! Well, sure... after they have turned their back on you. I know that one, too... the story about the four Sheriffs. Stardust. Damn snoop! At your age, fussing is bad for the heart! So, who are you? I'm a good friend of your son, Manuel. A friend of my son! If that's true, Manuel hangs out with some strange people. Your name? Django. That's his name. By the way, I forgot to introduce you to my friend Fidelio. Sorry grandpa, the force of habit! Yes, yes, the habit. I didn't mean to disturb. If Manuel isn't here, I'll wait outside. Come, Fidelio. Wait! If you're a friend of Manuel... I can't allow you to wait outside. Don't worry. I won't shoot him in the back. I believe you, man! Rosita, bring something to drink for our friend! And you, come with me. We're good people around here. We're neither in lack of good humor nor of some bottles of tequila. Rosita! Hurry up! 20 years ago... this little wench turned the heads of gouvernors and rich farmers. Rosita, the dolly-bird, they called her. You should have seen her when I got to know her. And the way she danced, man! You go there! Show our friend how you can dance! Come on, dance! Yes! Ol?, ol?! Dance, dolly-bird! Good dolly-bird! Dance, dance! Rosita, Rosita! Yes, come on, dolly-bird! Dance, Rosita! Look how she dances. How pretty! Dance, dolly-bird! How pretty! Oh!... Go ahead! Dance, dance, dance! Manuel! Manuel! What do you want? Your father sent me. Django is in Tampa. And he's waiting for you there. He said, he was your friend. In a way... What are you going to do? Go and welcome him. But, Manuel! This guy shoots like he whistles! Wait for me. There he is. Put the guns down! The party is over. You too, Stardust! Sorry, Seven Dollars. I know, force of habit! And what are you doing now? Am I at 10,000 dollars already? No, I'm here because someone offered me that for your head. But for me, you're at 0. What are you trying to say? That only a coward... will allow Cisco and that one to snipe me. I didn't want to, Manuel! It was Cisco! He said, we would do you a favor! No! No, Manuel! It's the truth! Aih!... Now you!... I never shoot... from behind. Come on, Manuel! Teach him a lesson and then leave him to me! I bet 7 dollars that Django wins. Shut up, you jinx! Come on! No, that's personal matter, my friend. You stand still, let them do it. Why are you laughing? You kill people... and never lose! Just like me. You see? You and me... we're in... the same business. Django, what would you say... about half a ton of gold? What are you trying to say... Manuel? With me, you could collect more than... 100 bounties at one fell swoop. You keep suprising me. What do you think? I like getting ahead... fast and strong! Tomorrow, the stagecoach to Puertoroli... will bring along half a ton of gold. Half a ton of gold does not travel alone. So why am I offering you... half that gold? Because you have no choice, Manuel. There'll be soldiers escorting. They earn 100 dollars a month... and don't feel like losing their skin. This will be a breeze for you and me together. No dead. Are you joking? I'll take care of the soldiers. Just one casualty just a single one... and your bounty will make a jump. And I'll find it more interesting again. Fine. Agreed, gunslinger. You take care of the soldiers and I won't kill a soul. And after that we'll go our own ways. I for once, will go to Mexico. The world is big and has enough space for everybody. Dismount! Let's go, Bonito! You see, handsome, what we've done? Mijanou! The first stagecoach to San Francisco. Go ahead! Hyah, hyah, eh, hyah!... Eh, hyah, hayah, hyah!... Hey! Manuel! Hey! Are you in, Manuel? I'm willing to bet 7 dollars... that he'll catch you before we reach the border! Be quiet, you old jinx! If I'd have accepted all your bets, I'd be busted by now! You'd owe exactly 7,777 dollars! Hyah!... You'll be the richest woman in Mexico, Dolores. Here, on a bed of gold. On a bed of gold. Take it and cover yourself. It gets cold at night! If I was 30 damn years younger, you wouldn't need a blanket. Where is the gold? Where is it? Talk, you hapless fellow! I... I don't know! The devil shall get me if I have the slightest clue! I was on guard... as I suddenly got hit on my head. And now I see you. That's the first thing I see since the hit... Damn idiot! Let him!... We have to find the gold... even if we have to stray through the desert for the rest of our lives! Come on, get on the horses! Hey!... On the horse, on the horse... And the pants have to be good enough for me, right? If someone finds something, fire two quick shots and a single one. If we don't find anything, we'll meet here before nightfall. Come on, come! I bet 7 dollars that they'll come back with empty hands. And me with blisters on my feet. Oh, my poor old feet. Ah, a pair of slippers. Minus seven. Well, wait. Look! And we're done for... And now? What do we do? Manuel! We leave the gold in here... and try to reach Tampa. But we'll never make it on foot! If you prefer staying here, do so. Hey, silent men have terrible thoughts. I know, and it scares me. Django will bring Manuel to death. Step by step. And who knows how long we have to wait for him. Revenge is a dish that's best enjoyed cold. Ah!... But I rather have something hot in my stomach. Don't worry, Dolores. You just mustn't think about it. You're young, girl. You'll return to your father and forget everything. Hey! Hey! Dolores! Hey! Dolores! My God!... Welcome back, gunslinger. Hey, you're sly, greedy, dangerous, but... you don't know women. Where did you hide the gold? Talk! But why? You mean, my share? All the gold is mine now, responds. So, look for it. My mother. You will tell us where the gold is. Right now! Find it No, gunslinger. You will be the one to tell us, but it will be all mine!... Oh, excuse me, I'm stealing your sunshine. Alright, is that better? With this weather, you'll have a nice tan... when you go to hell. A friend found you. Come on, handsome. Give your buddy a kiss. Ah!... Fidelio! Fidelio! Let me get you out of there, Django. I'll get you out of there... I thought... you were dead. I am... But I'll free you first. Let's go! Come on!... Juan... Hey! What's going on there? Quick, come with me! Let's go. come on. He left, Manuel. He left... But he'll come back to get the bounty. He said... He said you keep suprising him. But for the 10,000 he'll make a clean sweep with you. Who was that? All of a sudden, she came out and I... Yes... I'll write it on her gravestone to comfort her. Yes, fine. I'm sorry. What else should I tell you? Eh!... Nothing, Manuel. Nothing. You'll see, Django will come here and kill all of you. I bet 7 dollars! Is nobody in? Just be quiet, old knucklehead! Sure. I said 7 dollars. 7 dollars for the last time. Are you in or not? Get lost! Manuel! Hey! Manuel! Manuel! What do you want? I know where Django is! He's sitting in the rocking chair over there, just like last time! I saw him, he saluted me! Alright, this time you won't win your bet. Get out, Django! Let's bring it to an end! I'm here! Get the hell out of here! Manuel, are you ok?... Where are you? Go ahead! Man against man! Get away as long as you can! Now you'll see why they call me Stardust! Show yourself! Get out, Django! I told you to leave! Aim well if you want to get rid of me, Yankee! I didn't want anything from you! Ah, ah!... Oh!... Don't, Manuel! No! No! Oh!... Ah!... No! No! Manuel! Manuel! Manuel! Manuel! No! Manuel! Manuel! Manuel! Too bad, Dolores... So... early... Hey Django! I bet 7 dollars on you. You bet right then, old man. "THE END"
