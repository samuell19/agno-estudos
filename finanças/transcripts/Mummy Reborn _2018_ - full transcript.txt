Subtitles by explosiveskull Tell me more about your gap year. It sounds so interesting. No, don't be silly. Come on, I can't believe how many lives you've saved. No, I just did what I think was right, you know? How's your mum? Oh, mummy. Yeah, she's fine. She got herself a dog. Keeps her entertained. She didn't really strike me as much of dog person. Oh god no, she just wanted something big and hairy to have a go at after dad died. I'm gonna get some more bubbly. Help me. Where are you? Okay, come on, Max. Just one leg in, okay? One, again. That's it. Okay, and the other one. That's it, okay? You all right? I don't like the water. I wanna get out. Max, please, come on. - It's just a bit of a bath. - I don't like it, Tina. I said I don't need a bath at this very moment of time. Max, please, you need to have a bath. Come on, you stink. You can't go around walking like that. Huh? Come on, it'll be quick, okay? Hey, Karen, what's up? No, I wasn't ever booked in for work today. What, are you serious? Oh god, I am so sorry Karen. I had no idea. I don't suppose you can get it covered at all? No, I understand, yeah. Sure, yeah, yeah. Sure, yeah, yeah, I'll make it work. Don't worry about that, okay? Give me an hour, okay? See you soon. Bye. I don't want a bath right this minute! Fine. Okay, you don't want a bath? You're not gonna get a bath. Come on, get out. Tina is mad at me. No, Max, okay. Tina's just really, really stressed out right now, okay? Okay, come on, you wanted out, so, get out then, okay? I can see you, Brenda. Oh. Hi, Tina. Oh my god, thank you for coming on short notice. Sorry, I just, I messed up. I had no idea I was at work today. So, um, yeah, just let him watch movies all day and, yeah, I'll be back by dinner. Okay, it's all right. Tina doesn't like me. Max, stop, okay? You know that's not true. Maxie, Tina does like you. She shouts at me, and she hates me. Tina, can we just have a word? Yeah, it's, wait, can we chat later? You know I can't keep doing this, right? You know, coming here to take care of him all the time. I mean, when I signed off, you acted like you were gonna be your brother's full time carer once I was relieved. And you've had to fight tooth and nail to get full time custody of your brother after your mother's passing. What are you saying? I just would be careful. Of what? All I'm saying is that you are very young, okay? And you're taking on a huge responsibility looking after him, okay? And I understand it, all right? You've got, you've got work, bills, even more bills. You know, you just, you need to decide what route to take. I'm sorry, what do you mean what route? I think you should let him be looked after by professionals. Just people who know what they're doing, just until you can get yourself sorted. You know, your feet off the ground. Okay, like this situation, I can tell it's not good for you, and it's definitely not good for him. Okay, yeah. We'll talk about this later. Tina. Brenda. I appreciate you coming today to help, I really do. But I won't ask again. See you later. And how much is this one? Two pounds, 75. Are you serious? Well if you don't want to pay that, then fuck off. God! But I didn't do anything. Tina. What time do you call this? You said an hour, tops. I know, I know, I know Karen. Look, I'm sorry, I did the best I could. I shouldn't even be here right now. I've got an appointment with my sex therapist which I'm incredibly late for. I am never going to come. I completely understand, look, I struggle with Luke sometimes, so. I canceled the appointment, Tina. No, Karen, go. Honestly, look, it's worth it. Okay, look, I'm here right now. I can man the store. Look, I need to talk to you anyway. Go on. The shop. We're not pulling in enough sales. Well I wonder why that is. Why are you still here? Karen, what are you saying? I've had to resort to selling things online. Book Face, List of Craig. I think you mean Craigslist. And that's not the store that I set out to own. No, Karen, look I can help. We keep marketing it, pushing the products, write advertisements. I can make YouTube videos. It's Tube You. Look, I don't think there's any way of saving the shop, Tina. Not now. Karen, no. Oh, it's not as if we didn't see this coming. We've spent way too much money promoting it, and no one wants this stuff, not in this day and age. Look, it absolutely kills me to say it, but I've had to bite the bullet, and I'm calling it quits. Karen, please don't, okay, look. Karen, is there nothing that we can do? I can't lose my job, it is all I've got left. It's not a decision I've made lightly but it is a decision I have made. I can't undo it at this point. I've already had interest selling it. Karen, please. I can't lose this. It's all I've got, too, but I'm not even bringing enough to pay your wages. I'm literally paying out to keep the store open, and come next week, we'll be shut. I really do have to go now and I'm very sorry you're the last to know, but what I need of you today is to go into the back, and inventory everything, make a list of everything. I've got to put it all up for auction and make some money back. Okay. Look, I really do have to go. Oh. That's a really tight hug... I know, sweetie, I know, I know, I know. Poor little thing, poor little thing. Max, please talk to me. All right then. Get that down ya. Thank you for doing this. It's all right. What's a boyfriend for, eh? So remember this after I've had a long day. Someone's hungry. Max, stop. Don't talk to me. Just finish, eat your dinner properly, please. You're not my mom. Oh, I know that, okay? But I'm now in the place of mom, so you gotta listen to me when I say for you to eat your dinner. I don't have to do what you say. Yes you goddamn do when I pay the bills. Mom gave you this house when she died. So you should not pretend you paid for it, because you did not. No. You're right. You're so right. But you know what mom did do, hm? She left us in a shit load of debt and no Max, actually, she didn't pay for this house at all. She still had a mortgage out on it and today I lost my job. So you'd better get used to the idea that living here won't last. I miss mom. Just finish your goddamn dinner, Max. Please. Max. Just let him go away now. No, Luke, he needs to eat. Look, you shouldn't talk to him like that. What do you mean you lost your job? It's exactly how it sounds. So today I lost my job, turns out nobody wants to buy antique crap anymore, oh, and the business basically went piss out, yeah. What about, like, hipsters? No, they don't actually buy anything though, okay? They just mope around the store. Just, I, I, I can't eat. Where are you going? I need a bath, okay? I've lost my appetite. Max? Oh, Maxie. I'm so sorry, okay? I'm sorry for the way I've been and how I've treated you. I don't want it this way, okay? It's just I have so much on me right now, you know? Hey, look. Hey. I miss mom, too. God, I really miss her, Max. I just don't know if I can do this on my own, but I can't let you go, no, Max. I love you, you're my brother, okay? I can't not have you in my life. I promised mom I would always look after you, no matter what happened. It's just, I, I just get angry, okay? I get angry because I'm mad at myself because I can't give you what I promised I would when mom died, and I have totally failed you. And I am so sorry, Max. And I wish I could bring Mom back but I can't. I can't, and I really want to, but I can't. I promise you, I'm gonna make everything better, okay? It's all gonna change. Hey. And I thought I was your second mommy, hm? Thought you were. Okay, well. Get some rest, it'll all be different in the morning. It always is. Luke. What are you doing with my work papers? You know she's got this, right? Mhm. She's got this in her stock. Yeah. Yeah? That's worth like 800 grand. Jesus, I knew it'd be worth a bit, but, well, Karen's gonna be sorted. - Do you think that... - What? Nothing, oh, it's stupid. What, Luke, come on. Babe, that's worth like three houses. Yeah. I'm just saying, it would solve a lot of problems. Like, what are you saying? I think you know what. Wait, no, no, no, no. If I steal that, I could go to jail for years. No. No, I'm not saying that you should steal it. I'm not saying that I should steal it. I'm just saying. No, get to the goddamn point. I'm just saying that I know a guy, who knows a guy, who knows another guy. Well. Hey. He says he'll do it. For 50%. Right. Wait, who is this guy? He's just a guy into this sort of thing. You know, stealing and selling it on. Are you talking about your drummer Duncan? Eh, yeah, drummer Duncan. Look, Tina, he says he's got a client for this sort of thing. If we can just get ahold of her. So how do we get it? You've just got to leave the back door open, that's what he said. Okay, look. What if they take it, take off, and we don't get a penny? What if I get caught, Luke? You've got nothing to be caught for. They're doing all the work. All you've got to do is leave that back door open. This'll change your life, Tina. Make it so much easier if you just say yes. All right, all right. You ready? Of course I am. I was born ready, let's go baby! What if they take the amulet and sell it for themselves? I've know Duncan for years. He wouldn't do that to me. Look, relax, Tina. It's gonna be fine. Remember Paris, eh? Luke, it's just, look. What I'm worried about is... It's gonna be fine, nothing bad is gonna happen, Tina. Do you trust me? Right, this is it. All you've got to do is go and open the door and then that's it, you're out. We'll wait for the call, I'll meet you at the safe house and then that's it. Your life, our lives. They change forever. Yeah. Lukey, long time no see, brother. I saw you at band practice last week, Dunc. Oh yeah. Luke, this is Ali. Hi. She's the look out. And that silly cow blinding everyone with the lights is Jas. And I, I'm the main man. Should we get goin', eh? Anyone could turn up at any minute. Oh, she a keeper isn't she? Luke, come on, man, let's get the doors unlocked. Aye, you got Tina. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. Holy shit. Nice. Oh my god. Oi, we're taking this. Tell Jas to bring the truck 'round, yeah, and drop the tailgate. Hey. It's done. They've got it. It's all gonna get better now. It was just like that when I got here this morning. So you have no idea what time this took place? No, I don't have a clue. That's what the security footage was for. Karen, what's happened? Oh, I don't know. I don't, I don't know. I must've left the back door open when I shut up shop last night. Someone, someone broke in and they stole the box from the back room. The security footage, everything. Everything. Well, whoever it was, they certainly knew the layout of the store. Why do you say that? Well, 'cause they knew where the security cameras were. They took them. They covered their tracks. I understand you're about to go bankrupt. You think I stole this. You think I would do such a thing? Hang on, I'm not some kind of fraud or sneak. I don't walk around wearing a fucking trilby. Hm, I've heard crazier stories. Crazier still when you consider those who wear trilbys. Stories like these, like trying to recoup costs. Do not make light of this. This is a very dangerous situation. Look, it's not about the money. I don't give a rat's ass about the money. Whoever took this is in serious danger, detective. Whoever took this is in serious danger, detective. Serious danger, detective. Serious danger, detective. Look mate, would you relax? She's gonna be here in a bit, have a drink. Come on, man, I'm looking after her brother, aren't I? Oh is that who he is? Yes, Tina's little brother. He's asleep upstairs, so let's keep it down or turn that off or something. I don't want him getting involved, you know. What's all this, gamey soldiers? Luke, you're having a drink, mate. Now. Cheers to being bloody men! Let's go, men, ah! Let's get pissed. Let's go men, ah! Oh, mum's here. How was it, how was work? Yeah, all right. Well, she doesn't suspect me. Should they really be drinking that much? It won't bother them, it's fine. Seriously Tina, this is it. They've done it, this is the start of the rest of your life. Where is it? You wanna see it? Yeah. Come with me. Yes, mate! Luke, what the hell? What? They stole the entire tomb? They were meant to just take the goddamn amulet. Well I don't know, maybe they got carried away. They can probably sell what's in the box, eh? No, it's just, Karen, she said something dangerous could happen with it. Like what? I don't know, okay, it's just today, she looked really freaked out and it wasn't over the cash she lost, Luke. It was over this thing. It's just a box, Tina. It's not like that film with your man Brendan Fraser. What's the worst that could happen? Has anyone opened it yet? Nope. We were waiting for you. So you're saying some weird shit could come out and poison us, yeah? No, she doesn't know that for sure. What did your boss say, exactly? Well. She said that it was extremely dangerous and that she was really worried about whoever had it. Oh come on, just open it, it'll be fine. Go on, Jas. Oh, it stinks. Should we be breathin' that in? Aye, I've smelt worse coming from you. Dickhead. Kind of wanna peel the wrap off and see what it looks like underneath. Oh you're sick, you know that? We just could. Yeah, it looks better on the mummy, Jas. Oh fuck off, Duncan. I wonder if it's a boy or a girl. What's a boy or a girl? Max. No. Come on, let's go. Okay. Max. Max, come on listen to me please, come on. Okay, so, I am letting you use my laptop, so you can't break it, okay? All right, so just so you know, I have disabled purchase buying, especially after you bought that chocolate. I never purchased that chocolate. Okay, well, Maxie, if you need anything, I'll be outside. Okay? Don't do anything else. Look, Tina, Tina. You okay? How could you? The one thing I asked you, no, wait, I specifically asked you not to bring him, didn't I? My god, I asked you, look, I said not to bring him. I didn't want him involved in any of it. Look. I'm sorry, okay, I thought Brenda would take care of him for the weekend but she said she couldn't. What do you mean she couldn't? She always helps out. She said you hadn't paid her for the last few times. She's not coming 'round any more. Oh. She said she thought I should put Max in a home. I need you to answer me honestly on this, okay? Sure. Now don't lie to me. Just tell me straight. Do you think I'm unable to look after Max? Wow. Really? You think it, too, you think I'm unsuitable to look after him? Don't come to conclusions, all right? I just think it was a lot for you to take on after your mum died. Don't follow me, okay? Christ. Tina! - Tina! - Leave me alone. No, Tina! Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke. Let me chat to her, yeah? You just go in there, calm down, get yourself a beer, and leave it to old Dunkers here, yeah? I'm great with women. You know he means best for you, right? Sure. Look, I don't know what you two are fighting about, but, whatever it is, I'm just telling you now, he aint about to do this sort of shit for just anyone, do you hear? This is some proper risky shit he's up to here. Yeah, I know, I'm just finding it all really difficult in the moment. Hm. So you do this full time? I wouldn't say it's nine to five, no, but, I make a living doing shit like this, yeah. I'm guessing this is the biggest job you've done so far. Could be, yeah. Usually it's smaller stuff. Got a pretty meaty grab on this one. Oh, who's the buyer? Don't know. I usually just hand the stuff over to the guys who sells stuff to the buyer. The buyer don't wanna get his hand dirty, you see. Right, and you trust him? I do, yeah. Is it me, or can you hear that? Yeah, what? It sounds like a party's going on or something. Leave 'em to it. We leave them alone, they'll leave us alone. I mean, I'm sure we can take our business somewhere more quiet, personal. How do you feel about that? No. No, no, no, no. Okay, asshole, let's get this straight. I'm only here for one thing and it sure as hell aint that, so get your shitty little hands off me and don't you dare treat me like one of your hoes. My hands aren't shit, actually. I'm an excellent drummer. Fuck off asshole. - Duncan... - Hey. Put your dog on a leash. Is it really weird that I wanna screw you in front of the mummy? Oh well you naughty minx, come on, then. Max, it's me, come on. Open up, please. I wanna be alone. Go away. Come on, Maxie, you can't be angry at me forever. Hm? Yes, I can. Okay, well. When you're ready to speak to me again, I'll be downstairs, okay? Ah, whoa, on my bed? Get in there! This is so bloody weird, you know that? What's fun about being normal? So, already drinking then, hm? Not anymore. Guns. Nice. Of course they would bring guns. Of course you would bring my brother to a place full of guns. Look, Tina, can we just stop this, all right? I'm not trying to make things worse. I'm not trying to upset you, you know. I know, I know, okay, look. I'm sorry, okay? It's just, look, I took it personal. It's just, the truth is, well, the truth is, I know I'm doing a really crappy job right now and, I just get angry. I just want change, Luke. I know you do. And that's why we're doing this, remember. - I love you. - I love you, too. All right. How's Max? Yeah, he's fine, he was playing with his dinosaur, so. - Okay, cool. - Yeah. I wanna look at the mummy while you do me. What the hell? What, you can't look? No, look. Yeah. What the hell? Max. Max? What is it? Something's seem to have gone flippin' wonkers. What's going on? The mummy is missing and so is the amulet. How can it just be missin'? Who saw it last? Well we were in here messing about. One minute it was here, and the next it's gone. Someone come into this room and flippin' took it. Who would take the mummy? Well unless it's got up and gone for a walk on its own, how else do you explain it? Oh, I know who's got it. Move! What the hell, Duncan? Max, Max! Open this door! Shut up, shut up! Shut up, shut up! Calm down, Duncan. Calm down, okay, I'll talk to him. Just calm down. Max, baby, it's me, okay? Open the door for me, please. I'm not gonna let him hurt you, I promise. Just open the door, Max, please. For me? Max, come on mate, open the door for her, please. I didn't meant to scare ya. I just want a little chat. Max, come here. Oh look, there he is, yeah? I'm really sorry about what I shouted, mate. I didn't mean to scare ya. Basically, yeah, um, I just wanna know where's the mummy, yeah? And where's the amulet? What have you done with it? No, Duncan! If you even touch him, I will cut your balls off. Max, baby, are you okay? You good? Where's the mummy and the amulet? I don't know where the amulet is. He's trying me, Luke, he's really trying. I saw the mummy. Where did you see the mummy Max? Tell me. It was walking outside. There you go, you got what you wanted, now go. Walking outside? Outside the house. Everybody just stay calm, okay? I'll go out and get it. If the amulet was on the mummy, then it still would be on it now, aye? Go on then. Good? You've gotta take it down. Oi. It better be out there. Got ya. Now, where did that amulet go to, hm? You naughty boy. Hm? You naughty boy. Having fun, hm? Great. ♪ Naughty motherfucker Is that the buyer? Shut up. I've got this. Hello, Duncan speaking. Martin, how was the drive? Max? Come on. Max, look at me. Look at me. Max, Max. Okay, don't lie to me, okay? No. I'm not gonna be mad at you. Promise. Do you have the mummy? I don't have the mummy. It would be too big for me to carry. I'm not gonna be mad, okay? Just, tell me where it is, and we'll get this sorted out. You never listen to me. You never talk to me. Oh, Max. Yep yep yep. He's here. He's outside. Do you want me to come? No, I want you to find Jas. I need you to find the mummy and the amulet. We need to get this shit moving. Go on chop, chop. Eh, you've got a meeting, don't you? No, Luke, stay here. Yeah, find out if that kid's got it, if he's hidden it somewhere. Can you do that for me, mate? - Yeah. - Sweet. Martin? Good to meet you, mate. Sweet. Jas? Jasmine? Jas, what the fuck are you wearin'? Jasmine? So he doesn't have it? Apparently not. But I mean, come on, how in the hell would he carry that thing on his own? What are you thinkin'? I'm thinking Duncan is spinning us. You think he stole it? Yeah, and I think they're selling it. Come on, he lost it, don't you know the answer? Nah, he wouldn't do that to me. What makes you so sure? Huh? Well he's outside now with the buyer. I've shown you mine, so now you show me yours. Well at the minute, she's getting a polish up, you know? A sort out. Be with you in a bit. You don't have it, do you? Mate, I do. It's just, uh, as I said, it's getting a sort out. Look, why don't we go down to the pub, yeah? And we'll have a drink. Where's the amulet? Jas, what the fuck are you wearin'? Duncan, what's this about? Does this work on anyone? You do realize I'm gay? Oh. Ali, what in the fuck are you wearin'? Come on girls, it's all gettin' a bit embarrassing now isn't it? Could we possibly have a little bit less of the theatrics? In fact, if you don't have the amulet, I'm going. And I'm taking the money with me. Now I've told you, this won't work. I don't like flange. Now if you've got some sort of naked Egyptian hunk in there, then bring him out. Let's go, all right, yeah? But, otherwise, show me the amulet. Oh, as if. Max! Max! Max, please open the door. Please open the door, please. Max! Max! Max! Max, please open the door. Max, let me in you little shit. Open the door you little shit! - Max! - Max! Open the door! Go, shoo! Max, the door, open it. Max? Shoo! Go on! Oh fuck off. - Was that a mummy? - Uh huh. Oh my god. Oh my god, Luke. Karen, she was scared about us opening the tomb. What have we done? It's not a mummy though, is it? The mummy's real! But maybe he's friendly. Why am I the only one talking sense here? Get to grips with the fact that the mummy is alive. What do we do? I have to tell her, Luke, she has to know. You can't tell her, Tina, you'll lose the cash. You cannot lose the money. Luke, it's a bit goddamn late for that. Duncan the dick just ran off with the money in the woods, so what do we do now, huh? Fuck! I don't know what the fuck you're talking about! ♪ Twinkle, twinkle little star ♪ How I wonder what you are Fuck you! Got ya. Knock, knock. Knock, knock. - Knock, knock. - Who's there? Stone. Stone who? Stoner. Stoner. Do you get it, 'cause your Kylie's a stoner. When did it start snowing? I've never been so split up. Get it? Splits? For some reason, you look extremely sexy right now. Am I really stoned, or there's money on the floor? You can make it rain any day of the week, Kylie. Legit though, keeper's finders! Come on, hurry up. Like seriously?

Where'd they all go? - Back to Egypt. - Luke. Well I don't know, do I? Guys. I think there's something wrong with Jasmine. Stop messing about, dude. I don't like being cooped up in here you know. Pull yourself together, Luke. We need a find a way to get out before we're torn apart by fucking Jasmine. There are worse ways to die. Amen. - Luke. - Tina. - Max. - Luke. - Tina. - Max. - Luke! - Max. - Tina. - Hey. - No, Max. - Tina. They're here. Okay, Tina. - Maxie. - No! No. But, Tina! Oi! I am not losing another family member, Luke. You're not a hero, Max. Hey, Tina, you've got your car keys? Check. I've got the heat. Now the scream came from outside, so we're gonna go 'round the back to maintain the element of surprise. Let's go. Fuck. I am so sick of these motherfuckin' mummies on this motherfuckin' farm. Fuck. I can't understand what he's saying. Can't you just read the subtitles? What? They are saying the amulet can give and take away his power. And there is a missing piece. They are looking for it. Are there any other left alive there? Jas, what's going on? I've killed people. We did. What? The others. Where are the others? There's a girl, and Duncan. Her boyfriend, Duncan's friend. We need to leave, now. Aye. We can stop 'em. We take the amulet. Now! Max, no! Max! Why did you run in like that? That was so stupid. Let him be. I wanted to help, Tina. I wanted to save her. So what, if I don't give you gun, that means run in there like a raving lunatic? What did you call me. No, no, no, no, Max. I didn't mean that, no, no, no, no, Max, I didn't mean that, okay? What were you gonna do? Tina doesn't trust Max, but Tina doesn't trust Tina. Tina's a mess. Tina can't fix it. I'm sorry okay, I didn't mean it. Max! - Max... - I can look after myself. Max, come on, I'm sorry. Don't touch me, I'll scream. Max. Oh my god. He's right, it is my problem. No Tina, this is my mess. It was my stupid idea that led us down this mummified rabbit hole. No. No, I agreed to it. It was my workplace. I should have just said no. Come on Tina. All I've done is put Max in extreme danger. How are you to know this is how it was gonna pan out? Remember why you did it? Because I was fucking selfish. No. That's not why. Remember why you said yes. No, I did it for him, for Max. Exactly. And now... And now I have to finish it for him. You can't call the police, what are you gonna tell them? I'm not calling the cops. Hi, mom. I know I haven't texted you in a few hours. I've been kind of busy. Things haven't been going good recently. It's been kind of tough. Things haven't been great with Tina. I know she loves me. She just doesn't seem very happy. Anyway, I hope you are doing okay. I know you can hear me. I miss you a lot. I wish you were still here. Love you, mom. Max. Tina? - Have you seen them again? - Nothin'. I don't want to go in last, and I wish the mummies weren't here, but she'll be coming any minute now. It's like trying to find the needle in the mummy. Luke, please don't. Wait. Karen. Tina. - Karen. - Luke. Karen. I was worried. I thought I was going to encounter one of those things. Have you seen any? Yes, Karen, that's why we called you. Now, I'm not going to get into what it's doing all the way out here missy. Now is not the time. - Karen... - Quiet, Luke. I'm largely leaning towards not saying a peep if, and it's a big if, you help me get the mummy back in the box. Tell us what we need to do. Okay, so let me get this straight. The amulet is the source of the mummy's power, but it can also take his powers away, and the only way you can get him back to sleep is to cram him back into his coffin? And also sometimes when he's around, the weather changes. Exactly. Very well summarized for everyone listening in this circle, Luke. Although it's slightly more of a box than a coffin. What we need to do: we have to cause a distraction and get them outside. You run back into the house, Tina, steal back the other half of the amulet. Okay, yeah, I can do this. - I can see this through. - That's right Tina. Yes, you can. We're bloody lucky somebody broke that amulet, otherwise the mummy's powers would be damn near unstoppable. Whoever broke it has given us a shot at saving the entire world today. I've got something to tell you guys. Max. Max. I am so sorry. I didn't mean it, I promise, okay? I'm gonna make it better again.
