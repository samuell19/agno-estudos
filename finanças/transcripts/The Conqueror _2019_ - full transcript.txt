When a bird misses its mom It chirps on the roof When a puppy misses its mom It barks When a piggy misses its mom It runs everywhere When a butterfly misses its mom It flies to the flowers Flies to the flowers Some on the rocks Some in the valley Some on the roof Mom! Guoguo, don’t cry, mom is here. Guoguo, look what’s in my hand. - Pig Demon died! - Yes. Finally! Wake up! Get up. Heroes always come out of youth. Mr. Bu, you’re as powerful as your dad. It was only a shadow of Pig Demon. My father said, when the blood moon comes out, the real Millennium Pig Demon will break the seal. At that moment, even ten of me won’t be his match. Then please ask Mr. Wu Jingzi find another way to deal with that. Stop living in seclusion. We’ve sent out the exorcism invitations for days, my father must have had his plan. Mr. Bu! Mr. Bu! Mr. Bu, I have brought the Pig Demon here as you asked. My daughter and I have lived in the mountains for a long time. We have cultivated for more than 200 years. Our magic is weak, we dare not hurt the villagers at all. Please let us go as agreed. Is she telling the truth? Well… Chief! You… You promised me! Auntie He! Brother Pang! You… How could you… Wu Jingzi is here! Please let us go! Demon is always a demon. Although you can turn into a human being, you’re still a demon. No! The Conqueror Directed by Xiong Chen I’ll tell you one last time. The Millennium Pig Demon is going to come out. Tianhe Village is in danger. I, as an exorcist, have to go to Tianhe Village now to help them kill the demons. It can’t be delayed. Why are your eyes full of suspicion and disdain? Don’t you think I can’t handle with only a trap for boar. I just don’t want to hurt you with my power. Turn into human now and put me down, or, I’ll beat you up! Hey! Wait! Don’t leave! Rabbit? Ms. Rabbit? It’s my bad. Please come back! Help! Finally you turned. Since that, put me down now. I won’t blame you. Finally I found you. Can you focus on me first? Didn’t you have enough just now? I beg you, please put me down. How could you cut the rope so sudden without a word? What if I get hurt? Ms. Fairy? Are you really Ms. Fairy? Am I dreaming? Ms. Fairy! Wait for me! Ms. Fairy! Wait! Ms. Fairy! Ms. Fairy! I’m Shi. Thanks for saving me. I can tell from your appearance that you’re an exorcist. Fortunately, so am I. This is the invitation I received. Long Aotian? Isn’t your name Shi? Yes, I picked it up on the road. Tianhe Village is suffering from the demons. As a youngster who have come a long way here, I just want to do the best I can do to help. I think you must have received the invitation from Wu Jingzi as well. How about we make a team? And maybe we can hunt a demon tonight. A reticent girl who is cold as ice. And she can still be so calm in front of a handsome boy like me. I guess she is an orphan. Ms. Fairy! Ms. Fairy! Wait for me! First, I’m not your Ms. Fairy. Stop following me. Second, I don’t need any invitation. Wu Jingzi is my master. Last, if you still pretend to be an exorcist and tarnish our reputation, I’ll kill you. Ms. Fairy! Miss, Miss, don’t get mad. I know I’m not an exorcist. But I want to become one, OK? I want to be your disciple. Although I don’t have strong power but handsome appearance, I still have talents. You don’t believe me? I can show you my unique trick! Where is it? Where is my unique trick? Is it this one? Master, you’ve got deft hands. This… Ex-girlfriend? Biographies? It’s full of women’s portraits. Pervert. I can explain that. My book! My ex-girlfriends! My secret book! Miss, wait for me! Miss, I can explain it to you. The women on the book are all my ex-girlfriends. I’m serious with every relationship. Although it sounds absurd, it’s real. The reason why I made this album is that my secret tricks need to be inspired by love. Shut up. Then I can… I felt a demon. Given its shape, it has at least 500 years of cultivation. I’m afraid I can’t win him on my own. And now I got a drag here. Given their suits, they must be professional exorcists. I used all my 800 years of cultivation on my appearance. I’m afraid my power is not their match. Goodness! What a bad day! First a trap, then a Tree Demon. My secret book was burnt. I can’t use my tricks either. I just met my Ms. Fairy, and I’ll die like this soon? What I should do now is to find a way out. I should scare them first and then run away. Don't move if the enemy doesn't move. Damn! They move! Oh, no. She starts to make matrix. Run away yourself. Don’t worry. I’ll find a way to save you. Save yourself first. Looks like I have to pretend to make a matrix now. What matrix should I make? Why I have nothing in my brain? I’ll be done this time. Watch out! Is it really that easy? I knew it won’t be that simple! I have to use my unique skill now! How could it… Seckill? Zhu! Ms. Meng! - Zhu! - Ms. Meng! People can’t have two choices at the same time. I’ll choose you rather than anything. Mr. Bu, this is the 10th girl who likes you. Do you really only want Meng Zhu? Just make the medicine. Don’t touch it. It’s almost done. Zhu! You’re awake. Careful. Ms. Meng, you’re awake. I made this medicine by myself. You need to take it. Thank you. Don’t mention it. Here. Wait, what happened yesterday? I'm kind of in a trance. I can’t remember that. What is the whole story? The whole story… What is… What is the whole story? The whole story is like this! Last night, you didn’t come back till midnight. He was so worried and took some people to go to the mountain to capture… No, to find you. When they found you, you were knocked out by the Tree Demon. And the Tree Demon was planning to do something bad to you. Of course Mr. Bu wouldn’t let this happen. At a fast speed, he rushed towards the Tree Demon and used his secret trick, Three Don’ts Hands! Then the Tree Demon exploded immediately. Mr. Bu… Qiang, the Tree Demon was defeated by that young man. Young man? Right, where is that young man? Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Calm down, everyone. I will do justice for you. Our village has been suffering from the demons for long. We have already dealt with the Pig Demon. Now here is a Tree Demon! It’s beyond our endurance! Beyond endurance! What do you want to say before you die? How dare you do that before your death? Burn him! No one can kill this demon except me! No demon can stay alive if he meets me, Tu Youdao! Even I can’t kill him either? I never kill women. You’ll be an exception! Guys, calm down. Wu Jingzi? The top exorcist in the world? Father! Master! No! There are more people now! Zhu, tell everyone about the whole story. Yes, master. He is not a demon. Last night, I went to find Fish Pearl Grass and ran into a Tree Demon. He saved me. But he was poisoned by the Tree Demon and turned into this. He is not a demon? A man from Central Plains came all the way to a border town here, and met you, even saved you. Don’t you think it’s weird? Maybe he is a spy. Wait! He is an exorcist. He showed me his invitation from master. But his luggage was burnt when he was fighting with that demon. Really? Since he is an exorcist, put him down now. Father, we sent hundreds of exorcism invitations. Why only two of them came? Kid, do you mean these? Old man, on my way here, I selected the people who received these for you. OK. Now since everyone is here, please follow me to the Exorcism Hall. Twenty years ago, I sealed the Millennium Pig Demon. Now, blood moon is coming out and the Pig Demon will show up. That’s why I invited you here to help me to destroy the Pig Demon Statue before the blood moon comes out. This is the Gold Medal from the former Emperor. It represents the top exorcist in the world. Who destroys the Statue can have this Gold Medal. But you should remember two things. First, on the way to the Cloud Cave, there are two demons which are the two things belong to the Pig Demon. If you can kill them, you will get two tools to help you get into the cave. Second, before my seclusion, I put all my power into these charms. Only this charm can destroy the Statue. There are only five days before the blood moon day. Time is limited. You should set off at sunrise tomorrow. See you. Zhu, you know herbs well. Heal him tonight and take him with you tomorrow. Yes, master. Father, We still don’t know anything about him. I think it’s not appropriate to ask Zhu to heal him. Weilong. Father! You can’t let her take in a man we don’t know. It’s a critical time, don’t say that again. I’ve decided it. Father! It’s late, where are you going? It’s such a beautiful night. I want to take a walk. I didn’t expect a boor like you could have such romance. There are lots you can’t imagine. What are you doing here? It’s such a beautiful night, can’t I take a walk as well? Mai Ba! What are you doing? We can’t let him get there first! He’s not that strong. Star jade pendants? So, you like stars? So what? You can get me stars? It’s so dangerous to do that. Master, I can speak now! And my hands can move as well! Master, your medicine is really… My legs still can’t move. They still need two hours to recover. Thanks for saving me, master. Don’t call me master. You saved me once, and I heal you. We are even now. But, I have to ask you a question. Go ahead. I will tell you everything as long as I know. But I should make it clear first. I put Truth Teller Magic in your medicine. If you tell any lies, you will die immediately. Now tell me, who on earth are you? You’ll also die if you don’t say anything. I’m Shi, an orphan. I’m famous in Central Plains for my appearance. I've had more than ten relationships. But I'm single-minded. Most of all, whenever my love started soon, my lover would die for various reasons. They think I’m just unlucky at the beginning. Gradually they think I’m a demon. I couldn’t stay there anymore, so I came all the way here. I picked up this exorcism invitation on the way. I just want to make a living. Although I have power to kill demon, it needs the stimulation of love. The greater the stimulation, the greater the power. That’s why I compiled my ex-girlfriends into a secret book. Besides, I fell in love with you from the first sight I saw you. Because I dreamed of a girl from a young age, I called her Ms. Fairy, and you are exactly the same as her. So, I want to be your disciple, approach you, woo you, and get you. Anyway, I like you so much! What’s wrong? I feel so bad. I told a lie just now. Can I say it again? Sure. I don’t like you. I love you. Jerk. It’s better now. Master, is that the antidote for this? You don’t need antidote. I lied. Then what is that? Fish Pearl Grass. The grass I took when I saved you. It can be used to make Forgetting Water. Forgetting Water? People who drink it will forget the ones they love most. It’s for the people whose families were killed by the Pig Demon. Although it sounds cruel, it can relieve their inner pain. Forget everyone however deep the love is? If the emotion is too strong, the water can make them into a chaotic state, in which they can neither remember nor forget. Only at the moment of death will their memories be restored. Of course, there won’t be such a deep love in the world. Except me. I love you so deep. Master, look, I can even give my heart to you, but you’re still cold as ice. It seems that you’ve suffered a lot. Now please tell your story. Stop asking. I won’t tell it. I won’t give up as long as you don’t tell. I’m an orphan. The only things my parents left to me are the jade pendants. My master raised me up to become an exorcist. I have sworn that I won’t marry anyone until the King of Demon dies. Then I can marry you. I mean, since we have the same story and the same goal, I’m willing to go with you. And you know my skill of exorcism. Master, what do you want? Why are you coming closer? Master, what do you want to do to a wounded man? You’re really smooth-tongued. But you’re smart on exorcism. However, it’s very dangerous this time. You may lose your life. Aren’t you afraid of that? Lose my life? Well, I… You’d better leave now. If my master finds that you’re a fake one, no one can save you again. Wait! Master! I’m not afraid! I just want to make the decision carefully and get myself… prepared. Go? Not go? Go? Not go? Shi Yi? I told you so many times, hit my left face! She is Ms. Fairy! Why are you hesitating? Just go! Ms. Fairy, so what? Love will kill you sometimes! But love is special. Think about it, we’ve had so many relationships. But none of it can last more than seven days. Think again, every time you failed in your love since childhood, you always dreamed of Ms. Fairy. Put all these on table, what conclusion can you get? So, my ex-girlfriends’ deaths were not accidents. Ms. Fairy is the murderer! Pighead! Ms. Fairy maybe the end of our cultivation of love! The magic spell is about to be broken, and we’re going to find true love! Come on! Go with them! Go? Thanks for your guide last night, I thought it over and decided to help you to kill demons with no fear of death. To protect the peace in world, I’m will to take the responsibility of killing Pig Demon with you. Are you sure? You may lose your life. I’m willing to even if I lose my life! Zhu! Get up! If you don’t agree, I will never get up! She asked you to stand up! It’s been a night. You should stop pestering her! Weilong, meet them at the entrance now. Master might have already been there. Come on. OK. Those three exorcists have set off last night. It’ll be dangerous on the way. You should be more careful. When you destroy the Statue, you can set off fireworks as signal. OK. Shi, come on! Coming! Wait! Wish you good luck! It will be so great if they are not demons. Look how beautiful they are. These are all illusions. Find the King of Demon before Mai Ba comes and seize the initiative. Come and catch me! Guys, don’t know which girl to choose? Come on, show them your trick. I can’t stand it! Master, it’s so weird when you’re serious. Why? Because you look cute. Watch your words! Forgive him. Don’t take him for granted. He is just smooth-tongued. How could a shameless guy like him call you master? Zhu, don’t you think it’s insulting? It was him who asked to do that. I never agreed. That doesn’t matter. It’s your best relationship anyway. Master, what do you think? Stay away from Meng Zhu, or I will kill you. You famous and decent sects are full of benevolence and morality on surface, but always show your true colors in private. I know you’re Wu Jingzi’s disciple. But do you dare to hurt me in front of my master? I won't be fooled by you. You’re strong in appearance but weak in reality. Just a coward. You know what, Meng Zhu will never love someone like you. Stay there. What are you doing? I’m talking with him about humanity. Stop that. It’s the first barrier forward. Hey! It’s me! Idiot! Watch out! It’s me! Tu and I were tricked. I’m not as stupid as he is. Watch out! Tu Youdao! Mai Ba! Assemble! Mai Ba, is your mouth OK? It’s fine. Now it’s not! What’s wrong with you? I’m Mai Ba! You’re not him. He is unable to talk! Use the speaker! What’s going on? Why am I… Good-for-nothing. What’re you waiting for? We’re the customers. Call your boss… Don’t be in a rush. I know I’m so handsome. But I still want to take a bath before... How could a woman be so strong like this? What should I do now? What should I do? Come on! My ex-girls! Help me! Come out! Please! I need you now! What now? Master! Come on! I can catch you! Master, come on! You’re the senior one! You can’t even beat a female demon? Can you do that? Beat that woman! Beat her! Don’t look at me, go! Shi! Shi! Are you all right? Shi! Shi! Shi! Boy, catch me if you can! I have a secret mission for you. In the Statue, there is a Devil Sword. It’s made by the devil spirits of demons. Blood moon is coming out, Pig Demon will show up, and the Devil Sword will disappear. Tianhe Village’s suffering is caused by this Sword’s last spirit. So, killing Pig Demon is a lie. The real goal is to let them help you get the Sword. I spent most of my power to make these charms. I’m dying now. Here are two tips that might help you get it. The Sword can help me to live, you have to take it back to me. How do you feel? Can you make it? I think I can’t. It seems to be a white light. There is my childhood. My youth. Didn’t you see your ex-girls? Of course I saw them. But what I can see most is you. Enjoy your time. I’ll go find medicine. No! Wait. Master, are you going to leave me alone before I die? Hug me now, I feel so cold. It’s warmer now. I have checked your wound. It doesn’t matter. Relax. You won’t die. Don’t lie to me. I know what I’m suffering the best. Then, what do you want? Let me be your disciple. Are you threatening me? How could it be? I saved you once. Master, if you don’t agree, I will die now. It’s OK to be your master. But you have to obey six rules. No killing. No stealing. No licentiousness. No lies. No liquors. No disobedience. Got it. Wait! For you, there should be two more rules. Don’t flirt with me with words. Don’t flirt with others as well. Understand? Keep a distance with me and don’t allow me to be close to other girls? Are you taking full possession of me? You’re fine now? No! Master, since I’m your disciple now, you should give me a token. Your star jade pendants look good. It’s a pair. How about giving me one of them? Don’t be insatiable. Master! I feel so bad! I think I’m dying! Go find the medicine! Master, please go now! Master, I’m dying! I’m really dying! I feel so painful! I’m dying… Dying… Since you’re a woman, lady first. But we should have a deal now, the second thing must belong to me. That depends on whether you can handle it. You… There is moonlight. It must be the exit. Only a rabbit, it will be easy. Since that, it’s yours now. Moonlight? Isn’t that the exit? Didn’t we get out just now? Yes, the demon died as well. Boy, you look good. But I have to warn you, being a disciple is only the first step. Too great pleasures will bring about sadness. You know what, not only I made her my master, but also… What? Just go ahead! How did you make it? Tell me! I don’t know. Anyway, I don’t need Ex-girlfriend Biographies now. What did I say? Ms. Fairy maybe the end of our cultivation of love! The magic spell is about to be broken, and we’re going to find true love! Don’t worry, I’ll do my best! Wait for me! After we go through this cave, there will be the second barrier. After we go through this cave, there will be the second barrier. Did I say it again? Fellows, what’s going on here? I’m not playing games with you! Idiot! Twenty times! What twenty times? We have beaten the demon for twenty times! The second barrier is outside the exit. The demon is not strong, but every time you killed her, you will be sent back here with wounds and memory. That’s what I mean! Are you stupid? Since time can flow backwards, why do you have to increase your injuries? Let me have a try. Demon, take this! Shi! Now! See that? Did you see? Time can really flow backwards! Let’s try it again! Master! Come on! I’m your solid backup force! Strong support! Go! Watch out! Shi! Now! The rake absorbed the moonlight. That’s why it can do this. We just need to cover the rake up. Cloak! Give my cloak back to me. I’ve figured it out. Where is he? Where is he? Shi! - Shi! - Master! I’m here! Master, I made a kite with the cloak. It can block the moonlight. Take the rake now! It works! It works! Shi! Shi! Shi! Master! You’re awake! Master…Where is Weilong? Tu Youdao and Ji Wuqing are severely wounded. He is taking care of them. Are you really fine after falling from such a high place? I told you before, I’m talented. You were flying well, why did you suddenly fall? Because, I picked something for you. What is that? Star. Star? Beautiful. Master, do you want to see stars all the time? Give me your jade pendants. The closer they are, the lighter they will be. One for me, one for you. Even if I get lost, you can still find me. When I get the Devil Sword, not only can I stay alive, I can also command all the demons. At that time, you will be the prince of the world. Father, what about Meng Zhu? If we get the Sword, not just her, the whole world will be ours! Remember, love will kill a hero. Wait! Where is the rake? How could I know that? Come on, let’s continue. If we were not looking at these Neon Demons, we wouldn’t have lost it. And you don’t even care about it. Seriously? Why are you looking for it now? Why can’t you come and help me find it now? I don’t want to find anything now! Tell me, why didn’t you kiss me? I’ve told you when I met you, I have my own duty. Before the King of Demon dies, I won’t love anyone. Then tell me, you knew that I came here with you because I love you. Why didn’t you refuse? You knew that I became your disciple just to approach you. Why did you agree? You have me in your heart, why don’t you admit that? Why? If any of my behaviors made you misunderstand, I apologize to you. You already know my attitude. If you don't think it makes any sense to be here, you can leave now. My jade pendant. Not leave. Leave. Not leave. Not leave. Why don’t you let me leave? You don’t want to leave. Relax, I won’t slap you this time. What a pity. The scene just now, even I want to kiss you. You can tell that she likes me, right? Everyone can tell that. But it’s fine, the girl you love always will die within seven days. Didn’t you say that she can break the love curse on us? I said “maybe”. She is such a good girl. What if she can’t break that? If she can’t. I will die instead of her. No way. This is the true love. Are you serious? I’ll go chase her. No way. You’re serious. I’ll go chase her! Just go! Zhu. Weilong. What’s wrong? Nothing. You took the rake? I saw you… Weilong, where are they? Their injuries are too heavy. They have died. I have found the way forward. It’s not far from the Cloud Cave. Let’s go now. You have to take the Sword back to me, Weilong. Why is here again? We have been here just now. Zhu, this place is weird. We must be careful. Why can’t we get in there? Weilong, use the cloak and the rake. The smoke is disappearing. Weilong! Weilong! Zhu, be careful! Are you all right? The Statue is too powerful, it can burn our veins. Shi. Let me have a try. Shi! Your cultivation is too poor. You can’t stand it! Shi! Come back! No! Shi! Shi! Come back! Shi! No! Shi! Come back! Don’t come over! Shi! Shi! Shi! Shi! Shi! Wake up! Shi! Master, I think I will die this time. You won’t! You won’t! I have checked your wound. You won’t! You’ll be fine. Master. Can you love me now? Shi… Look, the demon is killed! Shi. Shi. Shi. Master! No, you’re not Meng Zhu. Kid, I’m your mother. Weilong, let me see the Sword. Weilong, let me have a look. Weilong, give it to me. Father, I have thought about your words. As long as we got the Sword, the world will be ours. That’s right. But I thought again… Give me that. It will be better if the world is only mine. This is what my son should be like. Ms. Fairy, it’s OK that you said you’re my mother. But, you said he is my father? Isn’t it weird? Kid, he is your father. Do you have a Breastplate? You father has one as well. Your father and I came from the same sect with Wu Jingzi. Twenty years ago when the world is suffering from the demons, to kill the King of Demon, the exorcists joined forces to besiege the Cloud Cave. We took a heavy toll. Finally, only the three of us got in the Cave. But we found the source of the demons was a Devil Sword. You mean the sword in that Statue? Wu Jingzi got devil thoughts in his mind and affected by the Sword’s spirit, he wanted to take possession of it. If he made it, the world will suffer more. To stop him, we had no choice but to fight with him. The fight caused destruction to both sides. In order not to let him got the Sword, your father and I exhausted our power to seal the Sword in the Statue. So, we’re all cheated by Wu Jingzi? The Sword has been sealed for 20 years, it should turn into ashes when the blood moon comes. But when the blood moon is near, the spirit released by the Sword demonized all the creatures in hundreds of miles. That means the demons in Tianhe Village are transformed by that Sword? You’re right. But my father’s appearance… When we sealed the Sword, he was cursed by the Pig Demon. That’s why he is like this now. He is really unlucky. Before we sealed the Sword, we sent you to a safe place with our power. We hoped that you can be raised by a kind person. We had no choice but to do this. I have forgiven you. Then, are you still alive? Before we sealed the Sword, we were no longer in the world. All you see now is just a little power left in the Statue. I broke that Statue, did I make a huge mistake? Kid, it’s destiny. Don’t blame yourself too much. Do you know how Meng Zhu is now? Bu Weilong has made her drink the Forgetting Water. That’s fine. She won’t remember me anymore. Boy… You can talk? I thought you’re a mute. Go on. You didn’t die actually. This is only your dream before you die. Your mother and I did owe you so much. But you have to do one thing for us. Eat more! Drink more! Mr. Bu… That Devil Sword is made by all the demons’ spirits. Its power can eliminate everything in the world. Bu Weilong is just an ordinary person. His mind will be swallowed by it and he will become its puppet. In that case, the whole Tianhe Village will be destroyed. Son, I need you to finish what I didn’t. Defeat Wu Jingzi and his son. Then destroy the Devil Sword. That is your destined duty. You finally got to the point. I knew that it is a trap. But what can I do with my poor power? You can take my power. I can do that? But the curse your dad got will be transferred to you. That means I will become a pig? Kid, you should know that what you are doesn’t depend on your appearance. Although some people have human appearance, they are more dangerous and vicious than demons. Remember, as long as your heart is full of human love and kindness, no matter what your appearance becomes, you will always be a human. Boy, the lives of the villagers and Meng Zhu are up to you now. I have no choice now but to take this responsibility. If you have decided, get ready to take my power. Wait a second. Ms. Fairy, I want to be your disciple. I’m not your Ms. Fairy. Stop following me. Mater, I told a lie just now. I don’t like you. I love you. Jerk. You may lose your life this time. I’m willing to even if I lose my life. Are you going to leave me alone before I die? Hug me now, I feel so cold. I’m your disciple now. Your star jade pendants look good. It’s a pair. How about giving me one of them? You knew that I came here with you because I love you. Why didn’t you refuse? You have me in your heart, why don’t you admit that? Why? If you don't think it makes any sense to be here, you can leave now. She is such a good girl. What if she can’t break that? If she can’t, I will die instead of her. I’m ready now. Master, I’m coming. No matter what I become, I’m always your Shi. I thought I was ugly enough. But you’re even uglier than me. Ms. Fairy, I want to be your disciple. I’m not your Ms. Fairy. Stop following me. I’ll kill you. So, you like stars? So what? You can get me stars? I saved you once. Please let me be your disciple. Master! Don’t leave! Master! It’s OK to be your master. But you have to obey six rules. For you, there should be two more rules. Don’t flirt with me with words. Don’t flirt with others as well. Your star jade pendants look good. How about giving me one of them? Don’t be insatiable. I picked something for you. Do you want to see stars all the time? The closer they are, the lighter they will be. One for me, one for you. Even if I get lost, you can still find me. Your cultivation is too poor. You can’t stand it! Shi! Don’t come over! Shi! I have my own duty. Before the King of Demon dies, I won’t love anyone. Master, can you love me now? Love. I love you. People who drink the Forgetting Water will forget the ones they love most. Forget everyone however deep the love is? If the love is too strong, only at the moment of death will their memories be restored. Of course, there won’t be such a deep love in the world.
