Why are you holding the pot? Just a short ride. No problem. Give it to me. Mr. Chan, please listen to Mrs. Chan... I'll leave it to you. But I'd better remind you the pot will tumble over in the trunk. Just a short ride. No problem. Son. Hello? Yes. That's normal? Water stains on the wall are normal? Obviously there's a leak. And those hollow bricks in the kitchen. You need to replace them. Next Wednesday? Of course! We'll talk it over at the apartment! 3 pm. Next Wednesday. Come with me to the new apartment. I can't make it. Why? You don't have a job now. What's occupying you? Mrs. Chan... You don't stick up for your dad. You're always idling at home. Is it too much to ask for you to come with me and talk to the renovator? The apartment is yours too. Have you tried looking for a job? I'm asking you. Have you looked for a job? With no income, how do we pay for the mortgage? Sigh. If you can't resume your profession, just get a temporary job. Be flexible. You can drive a taxi. How hard would that be? I thought about it. Once the apartment is settled, I'll get a job. Please can you do something? Don't just depend on me. Sell it if we can't afford the mortgage. We shouldn't have bought the apartment but you insisted. Okay. Sell it then! We'll lose our deposit. Losing the money, - we'll be living on the street. - Watch out! You scared us. Mrs. Chan, Mr. Chan is not saying we have to sell the apartment, or he's not supporting you. He meant to say he's preparing for the worst, and asking you not to over worry. Over worried? Then why is he not coming with me? Mr. Chan, what're you doing on Wednesday? Haircut. Huh? Haircut! Can you go another day? I have a job interview on Thursday. Mom, do you still want dad to go with you? Don't think you can stay out of it. We need your support for the mortgage. As long as you're not married, you still have to share the responsibilities. - Sis. - Where's mom? She's been angry since I'm back, exactly like you. Uncle ming. It's been a year. You've grown taller. You visiting alone again? - Ki. - Uncle ming. Grandma told me you have a boyfriend. Are you getting married soon? Chun! You need a hand? Mom, it's a big pot. Let me do it. You? I prefer having dinner on time. I'll be quick. What are you using it for? The braised pork needs reheating. Take it out. I did follow your instructions. I've steamed it for three times. Look, the meat is so tiny. And it's too lean. Ki, boil some water. Hey... What? Leave the chicken. Okay. Deal with the vegetables first. Got it. Don't forget the carrots too. Haven't you made the sweet dumplings? Ki, start making the sweet dumplings. Use cane sugar for the fillings. No, the one next to it. Can't you tell which one is rice flour? Hey, you need a bowl for the dough. You know you should use warm water? I know. Where are you going? It has lost its way. Send it home. Where's its home? I don't know. You should teach ki how to cook. The dumplings are not the same size. I'll let you teach her. When will she get married? She's just 20, too young to get married. You should take it more seriously. If I hadn't arranged the match making you wouldn't have a nice family now. Yes, thanks to you. Your son-in-law is "awesome"! Isn't chun good enough, huh? He has no bad habits. He bought you a house. Ming is doomed marrying that woman. He only came back for my money. Damn! Mom! What? Has ming asked you for the money already? Not yet, but eventually he will. I'll wait and see. Oh... I should have... How careless of you. Ming! Mom, are you all right? Ask uncle ming to get a bandage from my room. It's in the closet drawer. Uncle ming... It hurts. Can you find the bandage? There're so many boxes... So many boxes... You think I stole your money? Then why are you counting? I know! You and that woman failed the business, and you only came back for the money. She's my wife and your daughter-in-law, don't refer to her as "that woman"! That woman is cruel, not letting my granddaughter see me. She's only using you. Now I know why you are angry. You think I came back for your money. I haven't finished, where are you going why did you tell mom that I want to borrow money from you? I don't have the money but mom has. You don't have to explain. If you ask her nicely, she will... I don't want her to look down on me. No... it's not what you think. - Ming, come on. Don't leave... - Shut up. Just shut it. We're a family. Yes, so enjoy "your" family dinner. Ming... Go be with that woman. Forget about your mom. Just leave! Ki, stay with mom. I'll go get a bandage. I don't need you here. Finish cooking the dishes for me. Okay. Didn't you see that my finger is hurt? I did. You did? Why didn't you help me? What can I do to help? You are driving me crazy. I want a divorce... I said! I want a divorce. Don't you have anything to say? Fine, let's get a divorce. Don't you joke about this. I am not! I've been thinking about it. I'll find a lawyer tomorrow! I didn't do anything wrong! You didn't. I did, which is marrying you. - What's wrong with us? - I did wrong. None of us did anything wrong! I want a divorce! I'm telling you we're not getting a divorce. I want a divorce! You heard me? No! I want a divorce. Shut up! I said shut up! Yeung, please come back... They're fighting. Shut up! I said shut up! Shut up! I said shut up! Do you hear me? _ s - stop! Hut up! Shut up! Are you insane? Put down the knife! Sit down! I'm your father. Don't tell me what to do. What have you done as a father? Fuck! Son... Son... Mommy, don't cry. We'll come back, I promise. We have to pick up joy at the airport tonight. Okay. Be sure to clean up the room and change the bedsheet. Okay. Good afternoon, auntie ling. Good afternoon, Jayden. Dad bought you a pair of new slippers. These? Yes. Sir, are you all right? Are you okay? Be careful. Call 120. Be careful. Are you okay? How're you feeling? Weather is too hot... I feel dizzy... It's fine. The ambulance is coming. Are you in a hurry? I have a job interview to go to. Hello. It's kwun tong ferry pier. A man fainted. Auntie ling, why do humans live in groups? Um... people used to live together to ward off lions in the forest. But there're no lions in the city, so why do people still live together? Because there're things scarier than lions. Like what? What are you most afraid of? Cockroaches. That's why you live with your dad. So that he can kill cockroaches for you. Can you make the job interview? No, it was cancelled. I've been there too. Did you also see someone faint on the way to a job interview? I used to faint a lot when I was little. The doctor couldn't find out what was wrong. That's weird. But I noticed a "pattern". What "pattern"? When I see only black and white, I faint. So I always have my red sunglasses. I'll be fine if I wear them. Quite a weird pattern. Nothing is too weird in this world. You're right... I am quite weird having this "disease". Are you here for leisure? You said 'call 120'. I'm from Malaysia. I've stayed in China for six months. They use 120 for emergency calls. What is your favourite colour? For you. I hope you'll remember you saved a person today, not missing a job interview. Nice meeting you. Off I go. Ciao. Ciao. - Leaving? - Yes... welcome home. - Thank you. - No problem. Thank you for the slippers. No problem. Why don't you come in later tomorrow? Get more sleep after you pick up your niece at the airport. You have a good memory. Bye. Bye bye. I made some fruit salad in the fridge. You can have them when you are hungry at night. Instant food is unhealthy. - Thanks. - No problem. - Bye. - Bye. Is joy staying here for a week? Stop counting, don't be stingy. We haven't seen her for ages. I bought her a phone card for seven days only. I just want to make sure it's enough. Is that her? Is it? Yes, it's her! Joy! Auntie. Uncle. Joy. Come here. Thanks for having me. Joy, these slippers are for you. Thanks. Mom. Joy - hey cuz, I haven't seen you for ages. How are you ki? Not bad. You want one? No, I'm good. She's tired. Let her rest. Thanks, uncle. This is yeung's room. But he doesn't live here anymore. Make yourself home. Thanks, auntie. We're family. Take a shower and get some rest. You too. Joy, I bought you a phone card. She already has one. You don't talk to your dad, do you? Now we have an extra. It's fine, I need one for the Internet as well. Thanks. I'll get you a towel. Thanks, uncle. Get some rest. You too. Goodnight. "Yeung's stuff" Mom. Granny. It's joy she came to see you from the UK. Look at her, such a big girl now. Granny, do you recognise me? Where's ming? Is he still upset with me? Is that why he never came home? How much longer can I wait for him to come back? Tell your dad... Granny said... I'm sorry. It's my bad. I miss him very much... Granny, don't say that. Dad is not upset with you anymore. Then why didn't he come back? Well... Dad has actually bought the ticket... When is he coming? Very soon... When? He's on his way. On his way? Don't lie to me. No... dad... is on his way... We can finally have winter solstice dinner together? Do you know the way? I'm afraid you'll get lost. No worries, there is Google maps. Call us if you get lost. Uncle will pick you up. Okay. I can go with you to the ancestral house. Don't you have work? Well... I can take a day off. It's not necessary. Don't forget we'll have winter solstice dinner at the ancestral house on 22nd. Ki still lives here after she's married? She moved out after she was married, then moved back in after the divorce. How impetuous. And the other one never comes back. Yeung? Can you do me a favour? Ask yeung to come home for dinner. He won't say no to you. Sure. We should all get together. Yes. Why did yeung leave? Ask the person who drove him away. Everything here doesn't agree with me. Help yourself. Uncle will clean up. I'll do it. Don't worry. He'll clean up after eating. Orange? I'll be fine after wearing the sunglasses. I'm Norman. You can look for me on Instagram. Good morning. You are here! I collect stones for a habit. One time when I was in Austria, my train was delayed, so I stacked stones for fun. Then someone gave me money, so I just keep doing it. You want to try? First, you need to touch and feel the stone. Each comes in a different shape. You'll figure out once you get to know them. You stacked two! High-five. Yeah! You may try stacking this. Hey, who are you? Yeung? It's joy. Remember me? Why are you here? Auntie asked me to call you. What for? Winter solstice dinner. You live here! Don't tell anyone. I'm moving soon. I'll get you a glass of water. Have you been living here all along? For a while. They don't know? Um... Do you want warm or cold water? Warm please. Don't you remember when we played mahjong back in Australia? You wanted to play so badly that you made a set by yourself. Did I? The one made with cardboard paper? Yes. Oh... yes. Then you wrapped them with plastic paper. Jayden, your dad told me that you love animals. I have a pet. Guess what it is. Kangaroo. You're cute. Auntie ling, there is no more orange juice. I remember, so I already bought some from the supermarket. Here you go. Thank you. Why don't you join them? I can't stand her squeaky voice. I can't do this any longer. Why did you ask her over for dinner then? I need her help with something. Orange juice? Sure. You have some as well. Thanks. Take a sip and breathe. Then go back out there and work it out. Cheers. For you. Thank you. Left hand... Hey, be careful. I'm fine. What dishes do you prefer for dinner? I already said I'm not joining. Why not? There's no why not. My dad always wanted to come back for winter solstice but he never really did. This year he finally made up his mind and bought the flight ticket but he couldn't make it. Don't you think it's a shame? He doesn't think it's a shame. You mean uncle? Eight years ago, he lost his mind and pointed a knife at my mom. You're still upset after eight years? Of course. Imagine if this happened to you. He used a knife. So you've left home for eight years? Um... I never went back since I left on that day. Oh my god. That's crazy! You were only a kid. How did you survive? Sometimes I stayed at my friend's or spent the night in the park. There was also a partitioned home. I had no choice. Life was better after I got into university, at least I could stay in dorm. How did you pay for the master's degree in the us. Then? I was granted a scholarship. I work hard for what I want. You're right. Now granny and I are here. Let's all have the dinner together. You can do it if you want to. No way. They're at peace because I left home. They'll fight again if I'm back. Who will fight again? Auntie and uncle? He can't pretend it never happened. I want him to remember the consequences of raising a hand. If I go back home, he'll forget about the consequences. So you left home to punish your dad. Uncle is a kind man. Maybe it was just a heat of the moment. Maybe he just couldn't help himself. He probably regrets doing it. A kind man wouldn't flash a knife. People sometimes get emotional. We are all human. He was probably in a rage. Put yourself in his shoes. Did he put himself in my shoes? You don't understand. Your dad has never waved a knife at your mom. You don't talk about my dad. He isn't here anymore. Do you understand? I just don't get you. Why do you have to be so stubborn? It's just a family get-together for the winter solstice dinner. That's all. Why make it difficult? Eight years is a long time, why dwell on that particular moment? All I want is... The whole family to have dinner together. As simple as that. It's my dad's last wish. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. How much money did we make? It's dark. Can you see? I can. We made $472. That much? Yes. Then I have my dinner sorted. Here you go. Let's share them since you helped. Not really, I didn't help much. You won't have enough for dinner if we split them. Takeit well... wait... This is for you. Thanks. Why this one? Try feeling it. It has a story. What story? I'll give you a hint, it's about a lunatic. Is that you? I'm going this way. Hey... You said you collected stones from every place you visited. Have you collected from here yet? Not yet. I'm planning to go hiking and pick up some tomorrow. Are you free? Fancy going together? I should be free. Then I'll see you tomorrow. Ciao. Ciao. Check out the video. Is it done? Show me! Look, I was referring to this move. Awesome! It'll definitely get more than 200,000 views. And... You really need to look at this. Brilliant, isn't it? Yeh. Ain't I funny? Yeh. Part of the gist of gaming is about role-playing. Now that people are watching these videos instead of playing the games themselves? Don't you think it's ironic? How is your game going? Get it done quickly, otherwise you can't graduate. Most importantly we need to sell it. Stop it! Look at you, such bad temper. I want to use your car after the meeting tomorrow. I need it for uber. Whatever. You need it more than I do. Besides, can I stay at yours on 22nd? Sure. Why? I'll also move all these stuff to your car. Wait? Did you get into trouble? My mom wants to have winter solstice dinner here. I see. It's only a winter solstice dinner, just join them. Stop avoiding your dad. I'm not avoiding him. I... I don't want to talk about it. Okay. Mouth shut. Don't forget the meeting tomorrow. I'm going, okay? We're here for a business meeting. Do you know what's crucial? Confidence! Let me show you how this should be done. Brother love! Hey, sorry for being late. Bad traffic this morning. Not a problem. It's 2:30 P.M., just about time for afternoon tea. Let me introduce myself, I'm birdy. This's yeung, our creative director. How are you? May I get your name? I go by my gaming name. Love and passion. Such a terrific name... I'm also a fan of Lisa wang. I'm not a fan of her but the composer. Brother love, what kind of tea do you prefer? Let's drink tea and talk. Tea isn't good enough. Excuse me... What can I get you? A lemon coke please. So, what exactly is this collaboration about? We'd like to represent you and make you a kol. Kol means I know what a kol is. Being one of the top gamers in Hong Kong, you prove to people that gaming is for all ages. Imagine an elderly like you with such brilliant gaming skills. Collaborating with us, we can do videos and lives helping you reach a wider audience. We'll get sponsors and ads. Money and gaming altogether! Isn't this perfect?! Well... Let me order some food. Brother love, so... what do you think? Remind me your names again. Birdy. Yeung. How old are you? 27. I just had my birthday. You guys are of similar age as my grandson. He loved gaming too. So do we. He played games all the time, that made his dad very angry. He blamed his wife for spoiling the son. Until one day he looked up the computer, but it didn't help. He could lock up the computer but still couldn't control a person. Do you know why I play games? I want to understand why gaming could destroy my grandson and ruin my family? How is your family now? Welcome, sir. What apartment are you looking for? To live or for investment? To live. To live. I just found a nice apartment for a client. Come in and talk. How to tell granny about ming? Joy and I can't handle it. Why don't you help? Just tell her. She has to know. When will you come back? Until one of us dies? He's never raised a hand since you left, and didn't talk either. He's awfully quiet. The soup is good, mom. We didn't spend winter solstice festival nor Chinese new year for eight years. These are from foshan. Have a look. I'll show you more. Please have a seat. You've got a master's degree from the us. It can't get you a job? Why be a driver? An uber driver. Let me know if you need money. I can manage. I have to go back to work. Take the soup home. No, thanks. Drive safe. Promise me, you'll come home for dinner. Brother love, it's yeung can we meet? Actually... I'm like your grandson. I left home for many years. Do you think about your grandson? How would you feel if he came back? You wear leather shoes for hiking? My family thinks I'm at work. Don't you want to tell them the truth? No. Besides, they don't talk. Here is the bus. Not the right one! Who cares! Morning. Morning everyone. Pay first. You're such a good boy, Jayden. Thank you. Your little hands are strong. Feeling good? Very good. This is for you. What's this? Sticker. Thank you. It's lovely. Do you like it? Of course I like it. What do you want for next time? Next time? I'll think about it. You sure it's this way? Yes... This way faces west. It's getting dark though. Can we make our way back? Over there. Here we are. We didn't catch the sunset after all. Don't you think it's a waste of time? You're a spontaneous person. Spontaneity is the essence of life. The rest is just bonus. I envy your carefree spirit. You go with your heart. I'm just being selfish. I married a guy to get away from home. We divorced after two years. Then I moved back home. I know this is not what I want. But I'm also not sure what I really want? I'm just a loser after all... How can I be like you? I do what I want to do. I don't if I don't want to. I don't go after success. It's not important. The key is to be honest with yourself. For you. Jayden told me you had shoulder pain. This physiotherapist is my friend. I can refer you to save the waiting. Thank you. I'll keep it. Jayden is a sweet boy. He gave me a lovely sticker. What do you want to chat about? Up to you. Weather? Bullshit. Seeing anyone? What's bothering you? Perhaps we skip the talking. Just drink, buddy. Great. - Cheers. - Cheers. Tsim sha tsui ferry pier. Okay. Nice. I told you. Thank you. Technically, it's an a! Virtual assistant, like Siri. There're add-on features like user social media behaviour analytics. The killer feature is "eating together". Many of us often eat alone. If your friends Grant you the permission, you can have meal and chat with their "virtual" selves. Three meals a day. People can play it for a whole day. To be frank, it's not very exciting. It's not like car racing or boxing games, which can help people relax. Can this even be called a game? Excuse my honesty. It's encouraging people to escape from reality. It may work for making quick money when metaverse is hot now. Give me a price. I'll think about it. Come on. Put away your temper. I worked so hard to fix this meeting. Hey. - Hey. - Go away. What's your problem? For some of us, communication is not an option, but a challenge. Do you understand? So what? Sometimes people say hurtful things to others and the scars stick forever. I developed the game to help people to communicate, not to escape from reality! You do have a vision. You've been working on the game for so long. Has it helped you and your family? You have no game to hand in, and no home to go back to. You did nothing. If you really want to help people, sell the game and let them play. Now you're escaping from reality. Why didn't you talk to me just now? Please specify your question. Just talk to me about anything. Sorry. You haven't input my information, I cannot react. Just give me some responses! I can start in three months. Okay. When we got iayed off, we should've started our own business in mainland. But it's not too late now. Don't change your mind again. Don't say you can't let go of your family this time. This time I won't. This is the smell that I miss. Don't drop them. Phone's ringing! I'll get it, auntie. Hello. What? How did it happen? Mom... Why are you wearing this to work? Today is casual day. Auntie, the elderly home called. Granny fell this morning. What? She's fine now. I'm going to see her. You sure you can head there alone? I'll be fine. Call me if you need help. Okay. Your lunch box. Forgot to tell you I'm not bringing lunch today. I'll have lunch with colleagues, and go hiking overnight with my friends. Fhends? I'll go to the ancestral house after hiking. What a plan. Wait for me, ki. Granny. Where's ming? How did you fall? Did you get hurt? Just a little bruise. Does it hurt? Not anymore. Ask someone to help you get around. Take care of yourself. I'm getting old and clumsy. Let me show you something. I saw a line of ants marching here this morning. Look. Ming once had a bad tantrum at the age of two or three because he didn't want me to go out. It bothered me. Then I saw some ants. I asked ming to watch the ants. He watched them moving food back to their anthills. He was so fascinated by the ants that he didn't notice I was gone. When he grew up, sometimes he would follow the ants... What's wrong? Granny, dad wanted to come back to see you. So he's not coming... Not really... Two months ago, he fainted in the kitchen. We took him to the hospital and he never woke up again. Sorry, granny. I don't know how to tell you dad is gone. The ants... I'm just going to leave the food here and finish quickly. Take your time. Fill out the form first. I have extras in case you fill it wrong. Thank you. The first thing is finding a good school. Look, this one is good. The immigration process is easy. Jayden has good grades. It shouldn't be a problem. The location isn't bad either. Let me just open a bottle of red first. Be quick. I store the dishes inside the fridge. Reheat it for 15 to 20 minutes tomorrow before you eat. We should all eat well for the winter solstice festival. Thank you. Are you moving to another country? Yes... We're leaving in April if things go well. You never mentioned that at all! I'm sorry. I overstepped. Off I go... I made braised pork. Come home for dinner tomorrow. Are you seeing this? I'm trying to kill the cockroach! You live in your own world. You don't see other people. Is this too much to ask for a response? Have you done anything today? Why're you fidgeting with your notebook all the time?! Can you at least help clean up the house? How come there're cockroaches! I clean up every Tuesday and Thursday. Today is Friday. Wait... I want to talk to you about something. What? Ling, I thought about it. We'll pay off the mortgage this month. You and the children can stay here. We still have $800,000 savings. I'll take $200,000 and move to foshan. Why are you moving to foshan? My friend has a company there. He offered me a job. I'll rent an apartment. Who is this friend? I'll get elderly subsidies in a few years. I think I can manage. Look at me! Are you abandoning your family? Just for this time, can you let me finish? Our passbook is locked in the drawer desk, and the key is in the pencil case. Other valuables are all in the safe deposit box. The plants only need watering once a week. I fixed the TV remote control and also bought a case, so it won't break easily again. Try if it works if you have time. Tomorrow is winter solstice festival. Ask yeung to come home for dinner. I'll stay away. Please tell him... Once the mortgage is paid off, I'll move out. He can come home then. This kid's been away for eight years, I don't think we can make it up. You asked for a divorce eight years ago. I shouldn't have said no. I lost my mind. And ruined our family... I'm sorry. I truly wish you can live a good life, I now... Genuinely agree to a divorce. Still up, creative director? I'm working on a game, but I want you to try it. Do you have time tomorrow? Why not now? Brother love, do you see anything? Try looking around. Kan... How can it be? I miss you so much. Kan, don't go. Kan! Don't go... Grandpa misses you. We all miss you so much. Kan! Take a seat. Why did you make this game? It's for my dissertation. I thought it could help people. But it turns out I overestimated. Why? It couldn't even help me. I left home for too long... Eight years. I'm not sure how to go back even if I want to. Thank you for making this game. I could see my grandson again. It's too dark to see now. There's a park down there. The trees are pretty. I think about this day and night. Did we not do enough? Did we say something wrong? I, too, don't have an answer. My grandson jumped down from here. You are luckier than me. Your family is still here. Eight years. I've been living on my own. Eight years, for a teenager. What are you thinking? Breakfast is ready. Can you take the congee out? Remember to pick up mom later today. Okay. Give ki a call. She may need a ride too. She went hiking last night. I'll call yeung. If I can convince him, please stay for dinner tonight. The whole family should stick together on winter solstice. Can you do that for me? Dad. Give it to me. You see the photos? It's more beautiful than the photos show. Thank you. It's heavy. Dad, you can play your nanyin. I can listen to other music with my ear pods. I need a nap anyway. Wake me up when we get there. I talked to your mom last night, we'll get a divorce. What? I'll move to foshan. I thought you two would never do it. I want to leave too, for a working holiday. I've never wanted something so badly. I... lost my job a few months ago. I know. You know? Not only have you been pretending to go to work, but also pretending to not hear us. You can take them off. I thought I hid it well. Not bad. At least your mom doesn't know. If I apply for working holiday and mom doesn't approve, can you be on my side? What a feast for the winter solstice! - Be careful. - Okay! Did you call yeung? He didn't answer my calls. I'll text him again. Auntie... I told granny about dad. How come? I thought we'd wait for the others before telling. I couldn't lie to her. How was she? She cried her eyes out. It's my fault. I shouldn't have lied to her, or else... She wouldn't have asked for this dinner, and everything would be fine... Auntie, are you all right? Is there something else? I don't know... I'd better finish cooking. Thanks, dad. Are you sure you don't want to come in? Dinner is almost ready. Where's your dad going? Look, granny. It's joy! Granny. Joy Slowly. Do you feel cold? Wear this. Guess what I found last night. Ants? I'll show you. Here. Mom. Let me help with the dishes. Stop the car. Where are you going? Your mom is waiting for you. Get out of the car! - Hey! - Get out of the car. Your mom is waiting for you. Leave me alone. Go home and I'll leave you alone. Get off the car yourself. Where are you going? Don't you touch me. Do you want to start a fight again? Stop following me. Phleave when you head home what do you mean by you'll leave? I'll move to foshan. I want you to come home. Auntie... What's wrong? Chun said he wanted a divorce. Why... why so sudden? He said yeung would come home only if he left. I could have done better. Mom, let me do it. Take a rest. Have dinner with your mom. You know what? I'm leaving because I want you to go home. I thought my absence would bring peace at home. Those were my fault. Can you forgive me? Then why are you leaving now? How can it help? Your mom and I can't get along. It makes no sense to stay together. I don't know how to be a good husband nor a good father. Dinner time. Let's eat. They look nice. I learn from you. It doesn't matter how the food is cooked. Let's enjoy it with the presence of each other and not think too much. This is my first winter solstice dinner. Happiness to everyone! Happiness to everyone. Oh... I forgot the sweet dumplings.
