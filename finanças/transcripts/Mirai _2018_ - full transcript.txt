Be careful. Kun, your mom is on her way home. Really? Are you happy? Yeah! Woof! You're like a puppy. Babies like neat rooms. Shall we clean up? Okay. - Can you do it alone? - Yeah. Great. Yeah. I'll be upstairs. Okay. What a strange house they built. I guess this is what you get when you marry an architect. Right, Yukko? Kun... It's messier than before. Which do you think the baby likes more? E233 or Azusa? I'm not sure. Yukko wants to play in the yard. He does? Go on. Okay. I'll clean up for you. I better hurry. Are you ready? Go! Ready? Go! Awesome... Kun. Are they home? Mom! Mom! We're here, princess. We're home, Kun. Hi, Mom. I missed you! How's your cold? Sorry I wasn't home. Is that the baby? Let me see! She's your sister. Sister... Isn't she cute? Awesome... Be gentle. She's awake. She's staring at Kun. She can't see yet. But she's staring. Be nice to her, okay? Okay. You have to protect her. Okay. Thanks. Kun, what name do you think we should give her? Name? Yeah. Um... Nozomi. Nozomi, huh... Nozomi... Not bad. How about Tsubame? Tsubame... Tsubame? They're names of bullet trains. Oh, I see. I wish I could stay longer but your grandma needs me. We'll be fine. Thanks for coming. Call when you need me. Thank you. Say hi to Dad. I'll be back again on the bullet train. Bye-bye. See you again soon. Say bye to Granny. Good morning, Kun. Good morning, Mom. Good morning, baby. Ow! Yes... Ow! Mom! I want more milk. Here you go. No! Mom, banana. Here. No! Mom! - Here. - No! I'm going to vacuum the floor so don't scatter your toys. Mom!! There. Nice and clean. Hi, Kun. Congratulations. Thank you. She must be adorable. She's tinier than I thought. Things are easier with the second child. I forgot what it was like with my first. I heard Yumi is going back to work right away. Yes. A co-worker is going on maternity leave soon. She said you'll be taking care of the house in her place. Well, sort of... I just went freelance and am working at home. So I can do the housework when there's time. Terrific. Not at all... I'm impressed. Not at all... - What? - Nothing. What is it? Tell me. - Okay, I will. - So? You're always like that. Playing the kind father to other mothers. But they see right through you. Ow! That's for wiping the table. I'm going back to work in March. You actually have to do the housework. Not just talk about it. Okay. I can't handle everything by myself like before. I know... I'm going to do a lot of things for you. I'll take you outside and teach you the names of bugs. Dragonfly. And I'll tell you what clouds look like. Scorpion. And... You can take her outside when she's a little bigger. Okay. "Fantasy Garden" The hag and the mustache. The hag's face turned red with anger and she ran after the mustache. The mustache dodged her easily. He jumped onto the Yamanote line. The hag chased him on the Keihin line. But after Tabata Station, they got separated. Knock it off! She's trying to take a nap. - More. - More? Push it in further. I'm nervous with newborn. Mom! Don't let her suck in air. Dad! Go like this. She's sucking harder than before. Now get her to burp. - More. - She won't. There's a first time for everything. Use this detergent for underwear. - How about socks? - Socks too. What's considered underwear? What's going on? What did you do? You said you'd be nice! I can't. You have to be gentle with the baby. I can't. - Please! - No! Kun! I can't! What are you doing?! She's a newborn baby! - Do something! - Okay... Kun! You're her big brother! No, I'm not! Yes, you are! You're not my mom! Then what am I? Hag! Hag! What?! Dad! Good girl... Please stop crying. Stop crying... Now, now... How miserable. I'll tell you exactly what you're feeling. Jealousy, plain and simple. Jealousy? What's that? You had your parent's love all to yourself but it was suddenly taken away from you by a small baby that came from nowhere. You knew you'd be scolded for raising a hand to her but you just couldn't stop yourself. I'm right, aren't I? Who are you? The prince. Prince? Of this house. Before you were born. Now kneel before the prince. Mom and Dad used to dote on me. They were attentive and told me what a good boy I was and caressed my head lovingly. However! Ever since you came, they stopped paying attention to me. My meals were changed to discount products. No snacks. No compliments. I was either neglected or scolded. Then I realized something. Their love was taken away from me. I was hurt and miserable. Do you know how that feels? No. What? You don't? I see. Fine. But this is about you too! One day soon, it'll happen to you. You deserve it. GO. Here. Here. GO. Here. I knew it. What did you do?! Don't! Give it back! Give back my tail! Stop! How about this? Uh-oh! Stop! Woof! Over here! Stop running around! Give it back! No! I wanna keep playing. That's enough! Ow! No! What is it, Yukko? What are you doing? What happened to Yukko? I don't know. This is Kun! I'm Yukko! Please give it back. You're not acting like a baby anymore. Stubborn but quickly appeased. I was acting like Yukko, not the baby. So you can understand Yukko? Yeah. He said he wants better dog food. Is that right? I'll go buy some now. Delicious. You think I can take your place? Like giving her milk? She won't stop crying when I hold her but when you do, she stops right away. What did you expect? You didn't do anything for Kun. Sorry. I used work as an excuse. But you were fawning all over me. I'm a horrible father. I thought men weren't interested in babies. I'm getting interested now. You're kidding, right? No. I'm totally getting interested. See? See? You're lying. What? I just thought of it. What do you think? It's nice. Like a beacon. Yeah. I like it. Good morning, Kun. Good morning. Look behind you. What does it say? Mirai. Mirai? The baby's name. It means "future." Mirai... Mirai, huh. What a funny name. There. What's that for? The Dell Festival. A Blessing for girls. Blessing? We pray for a girl's health and happiness. Don't touch. They're for Mirai. I want them too. But you're a boy. Yukko, you too. You're a boy. Hi. Hello. It's warm in Yokohama. She's so cute. Girls are more fun to dress up than boys. Almost 3 months already. Her weight has doubled. Can she hold her head up? Just about. Mirai sweetie, this is Grandpa. Kun, stand back. This is for Great-granny. Mirai! Take a video of me too. Sure... Ah,good. Mirai! Take a video of me too! Okay, okay... Mirai! What? Is this a bruise? Where? Here. You're right. She was born with it. What did the doctor say? It might go away, it might not. I hope it does for her sake. The doll emperor and empress are married. Like Mom and Dad and Granny and Grandpa. Great-granny and Great-grandpa. Remember Great-grandpa's funeral last year? Yeah. Is that folklore about Grandpa true? What folklore? When they first met, Grandpa proposed, Grandma said she'll marry him if he can run faster than her. So they raced and Grandpa won. I never heard that story. Uncle Yamato told me at the funeral. It's questionable. Grandpa had a bad leg. So it's not true? I don't know. That's why it's a folklore. Hey. What was that folklore about the Doll Festival? If they're not put away after the festival, the girl marries late in life. That doesn't bother anybody these days. But... how late? A year for each day after the festival. How did they come up with those numbers? It's just a folklore. Uh-oh. I'm late. I'm going away on a business trip. No! Be good while I'm gone. No! Tell Dad when you have to go to toilet. Don't go! - Take care of the kids. - Hold me! Mom, don't go! Make sure you put away the dolls today. Okay. See you soon. Mom! - I want Mom! Not you! - Let's go. I know. Hello. This symbol is... She's arching back. Oh no! It's time! I want Mom! Okay, okay. Let's take a nap. Dad, play with me. I thought you were going to a friend's house. I wanna play with you. I thought you didn't want to be with me. I do. 80 play with me. Okay... Fine. Read a picture book. Okay. I wanna watch a video. Okay. Let's play with tops. Mirai. Have you ever seen a whale? I don't like Mirai. What? Again? What's this? A whale cookie! Over here too! Another one! Big brother. Stop playing with my face. Who are you? And don't hit me and make me cry any more. But I'll let it slide. Right now, the problem is... That. Are you... Mirai... from the future? Don't look. A year for each day... A year doesn't seem that long. But what happens when it keeps adding up? What happens? I might not be able to marry the man I love. What? Who do you love? I'm talking about the future. Are you going to race him? Just go tell Dad to put away the dolls. No! Why not? I don't like Mirai. Why not? We don't get along. I can't tell Dad myself. Why not? So please, Brother. I'm not Mirai's big brother. Okay... I see... If you won't do what I ask you, we have to play the bee game. Bee game? Shake your butt. Now walk. Sting, sting. Sting, sting. Sting, sting. Will you do what I say? Hey... More. More... Dad. Yes? Look at the dolls. Should we put them away? Dad. Yes? So you put them away. Okay. Okay? Wait! What? Show me your hands. Hands? They're so dirty! Forget it. Why? Just forget it. Why? Stop it! I have no choice. Box... Where's the box? - "How to store the dolls" - Here it is. Oh my God... She's gone! Where's Mirai?! Mirai, where are you?! Oh... She slipped off. Mirai... There. Did you see that? The baby disappeared and reappeared. How mysterious. How did that work? Does that mean Mirai from the future and baby Mirai can't exist simultaneously? Isn't your existence much more mysterious than mine? You're talking like a human. Not mysterious at all. That's not the problem. The problem is how we put away the dolls. Instead of wasting your time out here... What? Help me. Okay. Brother, keep Dad occupied... What is it? That thing you did. Huh? Do it again. What thing? What is he laughing about? Dad. Um... Why are you squirming? It's beautiful. Um... You have to go? No.. This goes off. And this too. Yukko! Don't disassemble it here! Sorry! Don't put it back! Why did it fall? Which law of physics was at work? Yukko, stop breathing. What's this? Which law of physics was this? I have to go. I have to go. Okay! Wait! I can't. Wait, wait, wait... Hold it in. I thought I was going to die. Now's our chance. Can you wipe your hands by yourself? Yeah. Good. How did it go? What? Where's the emperor's baton?! Baton? That flat thing in his hand? Without it, the doll set won't be complete. Is that the baton? There it is. Thanks, Brother. When people cooperate with each other, it brings them closer together. Do you like me a little now? No... Not really... Oh well... Whatever. I'm home. Hi. I'm so tired. You want some milk, Mirai? Thanks for putting away the dolls. I forgot. Did you put them away? Was that a joke? It wasn't funny. I put away the dolls. What? With Mirai. Mirai? And Yukko. Oh yeah. I also met Mirai from the future. What did you guys do? The bee game. Bee? And Red Light Green Light. Lucky you. Wouldn't it be nice to meet the grown Mirai? Not really. I can wait. I'm happy with baby Mirai for now. Me too. I prefer baby Mirai. Who do you think this is? Um“.Mom. That's right. Where am I? In my belly. You were born later. What kind of baby was I? Just like Mirai now. I don't like Mirai. Don't say that. Who's this? Mom. You look pretty. I do, don't I? You're thinner. Watch it. There's more here. This is when I met Dad. When I started working after college. The dark ages during middle school. Elementary school was fun. Beginning of first grade. Look. This is Yoichi. Yoichi? My little brother. Remember we went to his wedding? Didn't you get along? Of course we did. We're only a year apart so we got along like twins. A cat. It's a plush toy. A birthday present from Great-granny. I want a present too. Why? Because it's my birthday. It's not for a while. I want a bicycle. It's not your birthday yet. Please... A bicycle. I don't believe this. I just cleaned the room. I want this color. Granny's coming. Pick up your toys. This color... Kun! I'll clean up with Dad. He's not home today. Then I can't. Then I'll throw them away. No! I won't buy you any more toys then. No! Then clean up! No! I yelled at him again. I don't like Mirai! Don't hit her! I told you to be nice! Granny's here. I'll be right back, okay? I'm coming. Hag! Mom's a hag! I don't like Mom. Don't be mean to her. Mirai from the future. You tried to hit me with a bullet train again. It wasn't a bullet train. Bullet trains aren't for hitting people. It was Super Azusa. I don't care what it was! Why aren't you nice to Mom? I just can't be. Be good to her at least on her day off work. Brother... I'm not cute... What? Mirai and Yukko are cute. But I'm not. That's not true. You're cute. No, I'm not. Sure, you are. So... Wait! Brother! Brother! What? Where am I? Why are you so sad? Good girl. Don't cry. Thanks. You're so kind. But I wasn't really crying. I wanted to feel the emotion for writing this letter. What did you write? "Dear Grandma, I want a cat. Please let me." Cat. Animals love me. I get along with all of them. But my grandma is allergic to animals so she said no. She said I could raise one outdoors. But nobody does that. So I'm going to write her again and again until she lets me. I'm going to bug her until she says yes. Come here. Don't be scared. Let's be friends. - Do you have any siblings? - Yeah. Brother or sister? Little sister. I have a little brother. He's a weakling and a cry baby. So my mom loves me more than him. Even if Grandma says no, I think Mom will let me get a cat. I'm glad my brother is a cry baby. We're here. You can play with my brother's toys. You might get scolded. But it's more fun when it's messy. I agree. Are you hungry? Let's eat. You might get scolded. Food tastes better when it's messy. Yummy! Right? Yeah. Yummy! Yummy! How about this? This is fun! How about this? Fun! It's my mother. She's going to yell at me. Go home. I don't believe this! Why is it so messy in here?! That's it! I'm going to throw away all your toys! Mom! I'm so sorry! No more sweets for you! I'm sorry! Mom, I'm sorry! Did he eat? He won't wake up. Kun is my angel. That's what I used to say. Now I say it. I was disappointed that I couldn't get a cat. My condolences. I thought you loved me more than Yoichi. Now I know how endearing a troublesome child is. You were also quite troublesome. Strong-willed and persistent. I was always yelling at you. I don't remember. You never picked up after yourself. I only started when I got married. About time. I have a job but I want to raise my kids as best as I can. But I always lose my temper. I'm not sure if I'm being a good mom. All I want is for him to be happy. That's all you need to know. "Hope" is needed for raising children. Hope.. Good girl. You put a letter in Mom's shoe. It worked. Where did you get that idea? I should try it too. Hello, Mirai. She doesn't even smile... Remove the training wheels? Yeah. - Now? - Yeah. You're going to practice without them? Yeah. Are you sure? Yeah. Kun... Teach me. Put your foot on the pedal and push down. Wait! Now go! There you go! Good! Are you hurt? Ouch! Right. Left. Right. Left. Right, left... I'm too scared! Don't cry. It's scary! Your first bike? Practicing? We'll teach you. It's easy. Do you want to practice with them? What's the matter? Dad! Sorry about that. Kick the ground. Push down hard. Try moving forward. We'll wait over there. Good girl. She's adorable. Dad... Dad... What's wrong? What happened? She's seven months. He's crying. Are you serious? Why? Dad! Dad!! I don't like you! I'm sorry. Let's go riding again. I don't wanna anymore! There's a first time for everything. I don't care! I don't wanna! Kun... That's great-grandpa. I don't like Dad! What? Can I help you? Are you curious about this? No. Wanna ride it? No. - Don't be shy. - I'm not. I bet you want to. No. Really? That's too bad. There's a first time for everything. For everything? Yes. Just like they say. Your leg... Does it hurt? Oh, this? The ship I was on during the war flipped over. I'm used to it now. It doesn't bother me. Come in. I've never seen one before. Your first time? - A horse? - Yeah. - To see one? - Yeah. - Really? - Yeah... Anyone here? Yes. Will you saddle a horse? Of course. Right away. Thanks. There, there. Wow! Come. What? I can't! Dad! Dad! Dad? Me? If you're scared, the horse will also be scared. Here we go. The horse isn't scared anymore. It accepted us. Not scary, right? Just a little. Then look straight ahead. Don't look down no matter what. That's... See? Not scary. Nope. Look far away. Good. Let's speed up. Over there. The airplane company where I used to work. Still scared? No. Can you see the horizon? Yeah. A ship! The trick to riding is the same for everything. When you can ride one, you can ride them all. A horse. A ship. Even an airplane. Dad... 80 cool. Isn't it? I built it. No, I mean... Sorry. This is so important. How could you forget? Again, I'm sorry. You said you'd send it. Don't be so angry. Dad... Good morning to you. You're so polite today. I'm going to the park. I'm going to ride my bicycle. Yes, I am! You sure you're okay? Yes. Go, Kun! Look far away... Look... far away...! Wow! Good! Good! Yes! Kun, you did it! A piece of cake. Easy, right? Let's play. Come on. Okay! Good for you, Kun! Kun made it because Dad cheered him on. Really? Yes. Children are incredible. Nobody taught him anything but he just got up and did it. You know what? Mirai doesn't cry anymore when you hold her. She looks content. You probably got better at holding her. Who cares about me? Kun is the hero today. Sure. This is Dad. Where? Here. No, that's Great-grandpa. No. It's Dad. No, Great-grandpa. He died last year. Great-grandpa? He built engines for fighter planes during the war. He was drafted later on and was badly injured during an attack on his ship. After the war, he worked at a motorcycle company... Oh... Okay... Thanks, Great-grandpa. No! How about this one? No! Where's the yellow one? It's in the laundry. I want the yellow one. It's not dry yet. No! You wanna go like that? No! Then take put it on. Ouch. Looking for something? Mirai, you're flying. Let's get changed. I want the yellow pants. Yukko, you're giving me a headache. I want the yellow pants. You look good in that. - It's time. - I know. We have to load the car. I know! Well, excuse me. I'll get out of your hair. Don't be such a jerk. Whatever... I hate blue pants now. I want the yellow one. Don't take it off! Mom, you love Mirai more than me... Don't you?! Let's get going. No! Then what? I'm running away from home. To your room upstairs? Yeah! I won't come back! Kun! I'm gone now! Hey! I'm gone! Come on! Why won't you look for me? Hey... Where are you? Did everybody leave without me? I don't like everyone! That's no good. Not good at all. That attitude is... no good. Who is it? You're going camping, right? Catch bugs. Watch fireworks. Stay at your grandparents'. A summer trip everyone's been looking forward to. To make happy memories together. Why do you keep complaining? So who are you? Which is more important? Your pants or happy memories? Got it? Then go home and say you're sorry. Pants... What? I don't not like it. Huh? I don't not like it! Stop saying you don't not-not like it! I don't not-not-not like it! Don't not-not-not-not like it! I don't not-not-not like it! Don't not-not-not-not like it! Don't get on! You're not getting on, are you? Wait! Wait! The little brat. Tank train! Freight train! Narita Express! Ueno Tokyo Line! Yamanote Line! What model is that bullet train? Please beware of the approaching train. Tokyo Station. Thank you for using this line. No more service on this train. All passengers, please get off at this station. No more service. The doors are closing. Please beware. The doors are closing. Wow! A bullet train! Entry denied. I don't have a ticket! Entry denied. I'm going home. But how can I get home? We're looking for a lost child. Yes! Me! Daisuke from Gaya-gaya, your mother is waiting for you under the Silver Bell. Mom! Daisuke! We're looking for a lost child. Yes! Me! Sae from Musa-musa, your father is waiting for you... Sae! Dad! Sae! Dad! No.. Mom... Mom! Mom!! Hag... Only kids... Next. Did you lose something? What did you lose? Nothing. This is the lost and found. If you need other assistance... I'm lost. Oh... Are you saying you've lost yourself? Yeah. All right. I need to ask you some questions. What's your name? Kun. Noted. Next. What's your mother's name? Her name? Um... What's her name? Her name, please. What? Why? Um... Unnoted. Next. What's your father's name? My father's name? .Um... Unnoted. The name of other family member? Yukko. We don't call for pets. Another family member, please. Um... The name of another family member. .Uh... Unnoted. We can't make an announcement like this. So what happens? This is a big station. We get tons of lost children like you every day. When nobody comes to pick them up they have to get on a special bullet train in that hole. Where does it go? Children who have nowhere to go go to Lonely Land. The bullet train is arriving shortly. What? Why am I here? You may board the train now. I don't want to. No!! You may board the train. I don't want to! No! Then you must tell me who you are. .I'm... I'm Mom's child. Who? I'm... Dad's child. What? Who? I'm... in charge of feeding Yukko. Who's Mom? She's not good at cleaning the house. Who's Dad? He's not good at holding Mirai. You don't like Mirai. Mirai is... She's... She's my... Mirai, why are you here?! Stop right there! You may board the train. Mirai! You may board the train. Don't get on! I.. I.. I'm Mirai's big brother! Attention, please. Calling Mirai from Iso-iso. Your brother, Kun, is waiting for you on the platform. What? She's gone... There you are! This hand... Mirai from the future! A lost runaway? What an idiot. I looked for you everywhere. Let's go. Next. Wow! Mirai is flying! What? Are we falling? Yes. Do you know what that is? The oak tree in our yard? It's actually the index of our family. Index? Like those cards for sorting books in libraries. It's for sorting our family's past, present, and future. We have to find the card for where you are now. What if we can't? We can't go home. We're diving in! - Can you see the bicycle? - Yeah. That's Dad. His body was frail and he couldn't ride a bike even in elementary school. He's practicing in tears. Dad... Go, Dad! Who's that? Yukko. He's leaving his dog mom to come live with us. Yukko... Yukko! Mom! In her hand... there's a baby swallow harmed by a stray cat. She used to love cats but started disliking them after this incident. To that tree, okay? You're fast. I thought I was going to lose. You're funny. If Great-grandpa didn't swim like crazy that time... If Great-granny didn't lose on purpose... We wouldn't be here. Small things like that added up to make us what we are now. Now? Brother... Mom and Dad are calling you. Hey... What? Sit down when you eat. Want some? No. Mirai from the future... No. This is me living in the moment now. In other words... Do you know who that was? That's right. Go home now. Don't get lost. Is this goodbye? Don't be silly. You're going to get sick of me. Is your headache gone? Finally. Take care of yourself. There. You're so sweet these days. Me? You never were before. Like when? Before Kun was born. That long ago? You were always working and tense. So were you. I was? How am I different now? You're unflappable now. You were always on edge and anxious. Stop it. Don't remind me. Look how we turned out. We owe it to our kids. Am I a better father now? You're okay. Just okay, huh? And me? Am I a better mother? A good one. But not perfect. Good is fine. As long as I'm not bad. Oh please... Want some? Here. Kun! Mirai! We're ready. Okay! Come on. Let's go altogether! Okay! Mirai no Mirai There is nothing Nothing to be afraid of Just look ahead Start walking Step by step In your heart All your favorite trains Will wait for you So listen up Listen close When you move your body With butterflies in your stomach Excited but worried That's when You grow up Just a little Tonight the music train A tiny party train Coming your way Just for you Run music train It's your lucky train Laugh along Hold on So that happiness Will come your way Every teardrop Brings a smile And a brand new wind At the turn of the season You and I always Are a team of two Sharing both Joy and doubt Running down The rails of time Tonight the music train It's our dancing train Chugging the memories To the beat One day birthday train Starry Christmas train Each and every year They come back Bringing happiness One more time Ride the music train Sing to the music train Dance to the music train All things sad Will disappear Hear the whistle blow Tonight the music train A tiny party train Coming your way Just for you Good night moonlight train Wake up morning train See you again tomorrow I love you Wishing happiness Will come around again Ride the music train Sing to the music train Dance to the music train Do Do Do Do...
