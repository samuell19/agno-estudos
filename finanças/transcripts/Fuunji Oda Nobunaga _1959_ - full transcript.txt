THERE WERE POWERFUL LEADERS, WHO HAD BEEN WAITING FOR THEIR CHANCE TO RULE JAPAN. THE HOJO IN KANTO... THE TAKEDA IN KAI... THE SAITO IN MINO... THE IMAGAWA RULED THE THREE TOKAI CLANS... AMIDST THE CHAOS, THE ODA CLAN IN OWARI WAS IN UTTER TURMOIL... AND IN 1560, SPRING... MINO INABA CASTLE - Now that Lord Oda Nobuhide is dead, Owari is in disarray. I bet Iméagawa's getting ready to attack Owari. My son-in-law has no time for his father's funeral. MANSHO TEMPLE, OWARI - Well, did you find him? - No, we don't know where he is. - The castle says he left some time ago. - He has to attend. Go look for him again. - Yes, sir! - This is a problem. The sutra is about to end. He has to offer incense. - Where is the lord, Mori? - Sir. I don't know. I don't know what else to do. - Mori-dono! - Did you find him? - No. - We searched all his usual haunts. - Townspeople say they saw him on his horse. - Hirate-dono. Where is Lord Nobunaga? Isn't he coming to his father's funeral? - Of course he is. - But we can't keep reading the sutra much longer. - Keep it going just a while longer. - Hirate-dono, Sado-dono, return to your seats. We must maintain the decorum of the funeral. - But Yamaguchi-dono... - Hirate-dono, it's not just a funeral. Imagawa spies are here, observing Owari after the lord's death. - I'm aware of that. All right, tell the men to keep looking. - Yes, sir! Go! - Yes, sir. - Please offer incense. - Skip Lord Nobunaga, and start reading the names. Do it now. - Please offer incense. - This is Nobunaga's farewell! IN FEBRUARY, 1560... ODA VASSAL LORD YAMAGUCHI GOES OVER TO LORD IMAGAWA YOSHIMOTO'S SIDE. KIYOSU CASTLE - An urgent message from Narumi Castle! - Next! Listen up! It's not just a target. Believe it's the head of a famous enemy lord. Your shot will bring down the powerful enemy. That's war. - My lord! - I know. Don't eat food outdoors. Put my clothes on and sit properly. I know! - I'm not here to scold you. - Who turned? - Lord Yamaguchi who was in charge of Narumi castle. - He took the castle with him? - Yes. It seems he had an understanding. He put up the enemy banner this morning, killed those who opposed him, and let the Imagawa troops into the castle. - Listen up! If you hit all ten targets, I will give you a prize. - My lord! - 1 heard you, Gramps! You don't have to inform me of every betrayal. You take care of it, Gramps Hirate. Thanks, Gramps. Fire! Next! - Now that Narumi Castle is in Imagawa hands, we are more vulnerable than ever. What is Lord Nobunaga going to do? - If we don't do a thing, it won't be good for the other castles' morale. - Hirate Masahide-dono, what does our lord say? - Nothing in particular. I urge all of you on behalf of our lord to return to your castles and be vigilant. - Are you satisfied with our lord's actions? - Who are we to rely on and whom do we fight? - Tell us, as the lord's tutor, as Kiyosu Castle's administrator. - Why so formal? - Princess, I've had another letter from your father about his order for Nobunaga-sama to see him. Lord Saito is... - Kagamino. I am now Nobunaga's wife. I am no longer Saito Dosan's daughter. - Yes, my lady. - Father wants to take Owari without a fight. I'm not going to deliver my husband into his hands. Kagamino, you wrote my father about how the lord acted at his father's funeral? - Yes, my lady. - I wrote to him, too. Our land is surrounded by enemies. What would the spies report if the lord acted as heartbroken as the other clan members? Our lord played the part of the rogue and showed... he wasn't worried at all. But I know that my lord entered the temple with the deepest sorrow of all who attended. No matter what my father intended, I am now Nobunaga's wife. My fate and happiness are linked to my husband's. He is my priority. - 1 gather from Kagamino's report that Nobunaga has no intention of leaving Owari. - What does Princess No say? - Women are influenced by their men. O-No only praises Nobunaga. If he won't attack, perhaps we should. - Meaning? - Send a messenger to Owari. I will pay a visit to my daughter and son-in-law. Depending on the enemy, war must be waged when opportunity presents itself. - Have you seen our lord? Where has he gone at this important time? - My lord! - Tokichiro! Follow me! You run as fast as a horse. - I've been running all over Japan ever since I was born. - What big fibs you tell. Get off your horses! Tokichiro will teach us about other domains! - My knowledge extends from the north domains all the way to Okinawa. Which domain do you want me to talk about? - How about Mino? - Your wife's home...? Well, that's a problem. - It's okay. Just tell me the facts. - Yes. The lord of Mino is Saito Dosan, your father-in-law. He really is a viper. - Everyone knows that. The viper keeps wanting to see me. - Oh no, you mustn't! You'll just play into his hands. My lord... Dosan has no compassion for family or friends. He only thinks of how to preempt Lord Imagawa from marching into Kyoto and taking power. You must not see the viper! - What? You want me to see the viper? - Since you won't go to him, he's now saying he will come to see you. Thousands of soldiers will come into our land as his attendants. In order to stop that, you must... - 1 don't want to see the viper. - That's the wrong attitude. If you meet Saito, and it seems you two have an allegiance, Imagawa will think twice about attacking us. - You go to see him, Gramps. I hate formalities and ceremony. - My lord... You are not afraid to see Saito Dosan are you? - When I think him worth seeing, I will see him. You and I have the same idea. So you do what you think fit. It's settled... Gramps... Hirate, you are my proxy. Everyone thinks so. So, do it. - The lord's proxy... Everyone thinks so. - Drink up, everyone. - Excuse me... My lord, what happened at the meeting of the elders? - What's the strategy against Imagawa? - Nothing that fancy. They think if they get together and talk, the number of Imagawa troops will go down. I'm not involved. Gramps is in charge. - My lord, today, when we were out on a day trip, I hear Hirate-dono was looking for you. What was that about? - Are you men buying into this?! Do you think that an urgent messenger means that there will be an attack on the castle? Fools! When one dog barks, all the dogs will join in. - I'm sorry, sir. - Make no mistake, Gramps Hirate is sharp. To hold Imagawa at bay, he suggests I meet the viper. He's really smart. - You're not going to see him? - Tokichiro was adamant you not see him. - It makes no difference whether I or Gramps go. If it's all the same, I want it to be to Gramp's credit. He's looked after me since I was born. I'm the one responsible for all his grey hair. As long as he's here, I can run around with all of you without worries. Look, it's done. Drink up! Dig in! No, bring me my clothes! - You practiced with the wooden sword today? - I need to talk to Gramps. Someone go fetch him. O-No... When Gramps comes, I have a surprise for you. - I wonder what it is. - My lord! Reporting, sir. - I'm listening. - An urgent message from Hirate-dono's mansion. Hirate-dono committed suicide last night and has expired. - What?! Gramps?! Gramps... Gramps! Gramps. Gramps... You must be tired from taking care of me. TESTAMENT "My impertinence in admonishing you... "My inadequacies in advising you... "I fear that my being in this world "prevents you from taking your proper place. "1 will atone for this by putting an end to my life." "If you have any pity for my death..." - "Please consider the path you must take. “With me gone, your strange behavior... “..will lead people to make light of you. “From now on, you are the sole leader of Owari. “You may one day become the leader of Japan. “If you pity me... “..please make this dream 1 have for you come true." - Gramps! Gramps, why did you die?! Why did you die?! Why didn't you stay alive and scold me? Why didn't you hit me with this whip? How can I do this all alone? Did you think you were an obstacle? Fool! Gramps, you're a fool! Fool! Gramps, you're a fool! Fool! Fool! Gramps! Why didn't you stay alive to see what I could do? I wanted to hear you praise me. All you did was worry and fret about me. Gramps... Gramps, you fool! You were the only ally I had! Gramps! Gramps! Gramps... Gramps! - What does Nobunaga say in his letter? - With the death of Elder Hirate whom he relied on, my daughter's husband seems to have gone mad. - Meaning? - He says he wants to come pay his respects to me. - So Nobunaga will come to you? - You know Shotoku Temple in Tomita? He said he will come there. Perhaps it is better for him to die at his father-in-law's hand than Imagawa's... It sounds bad, but... That means No can come home. - O-No? - You were a fool, just as they say. - What? - You don't know how dangerous the viper is. - So I shouldn't see Dosan? - They say a viper eats its young. Who knows what my father will do. - He made his daughter marry me who had the reputation of being a fool. I know. - Then why are you going to see him? - O-No, why stop me from going to war? If I were to be killed by Dosan at this meeting, we would surely lose to Imagawa without a fight. We'll fight both Imagawa and Dosan. My path is predetermined after all. - My lord. This is your first battle. Congratulations. SHOTOKU-JI TEMPLE - Keep the musket squad at the back of the temple until I give orders. If my son-in-law sees them he might faint. Is the division ready? - When the deed here is done, they will leave for the Owari border. - Good, good! Owari is a prosperous land. Let's go to the highway to see him arrive. - 1 will get the horses ready. Hundreds of our most able men are disguised as farmer and are stationed by the highway. - Yozaemon... Once Nobunaga enters Shotoku Temple, remove the local residents and close the highway. His procession will become mine. Owari will be a good shield when we engage the Imagawa. - Looks like he's here. They are here. It's Nobunaga's procession. - So they came by horse. - Not that many horses. Young clansmen are at the forefront. - The famous children's army. How many? - About 200. - Not worth coming out here to see. That means he only has about 500 men. Yozaemon, I will lead the division and go to Owari. - Oh, next comes the archers. - Archers? How many? - I count about 300. -300? That fool. When they enter Shotoku Temple, cut the strings of their bows. So next comes the horses? - Oh, it's the gunnery squad! - Gunners? Kagamino did mention he had arquebuses. Did he bring 20 or so? - Oh no, like the archers, there are about 300. - What? 300 guns? - Next are the lancers. There's a lot of them. About 800. - Is he in the waiting room? - He should be here shortly. - As soon as he enters, I will indicate his attire insults me and kill him on the spot. At the same time, you cut off access to the hallway! Who's that? -I am Oda Kazusanosuke Nobunaga! - Welcome, son-in-law. I am Dosan. - I'm sorry for not greeting you earlier. - What? - Didn't you come to greet the procession at the outskirts of town? -I am happy to have the best son-in-law in Japan. - Princess No is a good wife. She was worried about my safety. - She was? Why? - She said you were called the viper. - What a harsh statement. But appropriate for the man the viper's daughter has fallen in love with. You have power. But the problem is Imagawa. Lord Imagawa is very powerful. Make sure you are fully prepared. Why are you sitting around? Bring some saké. Tell those men in the garden to go away! - My lady! My lady! - My lady! The lord has returned! - My lord! - Princess No, why are you dressed in white? Your father looked well. O-No, are you crying? As you said, your father was planning to kill me. But, he changed his mind, grasping the situation. He told me to be vigilant against the Imagawa. What's the matter? - My lord, take your clothes off as always. Yell for food like you always do. - What? Seeing your beloved husband home safe, you've gone off your head. - Not at all. Handling the viper is not much of an accomplishment. My lord isn't a man who boasts. Please give me back my husband. - O-No, life and death are intertwined. Watch me carefully. - Why? - 1 didn't change my clothes because I won. I was waiting for the right moment. Gramps Hirate is gone. You're the only one I can rely on. But I'm not going to make you do his work. Understand? - My lord! You are... - Yes? - The man that made me forget my filial duty. - That's the first time you ever praised me. - Don't be mean to me. - I'd like to drink alone with you tonight. Tell them to get it ready. SUNPU CASTLE SPRING 1560... LORD IMAGAWA DECIDES TO MARCH INTO KYOTO AND AMASSES ALL HIS TROOPS IN SUNPU. - My lord! My lord! My lord! Tokichiro, where's the lord? - He's in there. He said he wanted to be alone. - It's urgent. - No, don't. HIRATE MASAHIDE GRAVE - Didn't Tokichiro stop you? Why did you come? I'm talking to Gramps now. - Excuse me. Spies from Suruga have reported that all of Imagawa's vassals are amassing in Sunpu Castle. - Is that all? If it was Gramps, he would have said that he's ordered all our vassals to come here. -I'm sorry. I will see to it immediately. - Gramps... What's the use of getting them all together? But if I didn't, they'd just get anxious. If you were here, you would have taken care of them. That's why I could do as I pleased. Gramps. Gramps! Dear Gramps! Dear Gramps! I haven't changed a bit. Either I'll end as the Owari fool... Or I'll become the ruler of Japan! Gramps... I will come again. - Imagawa has a pact with Hojo and Takeda. His entire army will march to Owari. So we should amass all our men at Kiyosu Castle and hold up in the castle, then perhaps we can rely on Saito coming to help us. In the worst case, we can try to negotiate a peace pact with Imagawa. I, Shibata, advise this for the sake of the clan. - 1, Sado, agree with Sir Shibata. - 1, Sakuma, also agree. - In the words of my father... In defense there is always defeat, but in attack there is sometimes victory. - We have only 4,000 men. How are we to stop an army of 40,000 flowing like a river towards us? - We're receiving requests for reinforcements from our outlying castles, urgently. - All right! The war council for today is over. Thank you all! 40,000 against 4,000. O-No. - Yes? - Do you know of a way to defeat an enemy of 10,000 with only 1,000 men? - Oh, is that all? That's 10,000 to 1,000... So one soldier should kill ten of them. - I see. Is that how it's done? I hear you were the cleverest one in Mino. How does one soldier kill ten men? - If I knew, I would be the ruler of Japan by now. But assuming the ten were asleep... - Asleep? - If you kill two, the other eight will wake up. So I guess it won't work. - No, it won't. If ten were asleep... - Where are you going? - Doesn't matter. - But the tea... - O-No, you are an excellent wife. Bring me my horse! - Strange man. - I hear the Imagawa army will attack us. But he just rides his horse. - Does this mean we will be under Imagawa rule? - Tokichiro, you are not living up to your reputation. - But your horse is too fast. - Tokichiro, since you say you have been all around Japan... you must know the bandits in Owari. - Well yes, some. Hachisuka Koroku is the leader. He's a difficult character. Why do you ask? - Fool! Don't you see what I'm getting at? -lgetit! - Manchiyo-sama? - Miss Yumi. - What have they decided at the castle? - Nothing of importance. - I hear orders to mobilize are imminent. I went to the shrine today. - Why? - To pray you will serve with distinction. - Thank you. - Yae? - Yes. - Starting tomorrow, I'll be staying at the castle. - Yes, I've prepared your armor and horse. - 1 don't need the armor. - But... - Don't ask. It's the lord's orders. - So are we mobilizing today or tomorrow? - 1 don't know. - Don't know? But that doesn't make sense. I hear the Imagawa army is at our border. Wait, Manchiyo! - Seconds? - No. - You must eat before a battle. Your deceased father used to eat twice as much. - 1 don't know if we are in for a battle or not. - He's already given up. - He doesn't look like a lord who's facing an army of 40,000 at his door. - No need to spy any further. He is indeed the Owari fool. - Koroku-dono, I've brought Lord Nobunaga. Please meet him. - I'm Nobunaga. When Tokichiro suggested you serve me, I hear you said you wanted to meet me first. - That's right. - Why did you want to meet me? - I wanted to determine what kind of man you are. Our roots go back to the Imperial Court. Though circumstances went against us, we didn't bow to the Ashikaga Shogunate. We're not descendants of poor feudal lords! So even if you're the lord of the country... I wouldn't bow to you until I know who you are! - Koroku-dono. - Tokichiro, bring this man to the castle tomorrow. - What? - Silence! You and I are of one mind. Listen... Imagawa will attack Kyoto to become ruler of Japan. Not because he cares for the population, nor because he wants to serve the emperor. He wants to use these uncertain times to take the country for himself. I am determined to prevent this madness. Because I want to unite the country with the approval of the emperor. The battle with Imagawa is the first step. If you understand, even if I didn't ask you, you would want to cooperate. If you don't, you don't have any principles. I'll behead you and tear out your tongue. Well? - Now that I know your intentions, I apologize for my previous behavior. Please forgive me. - This is great! This is as it should be. Our lord is a samurai, you, descended from the court and I'm a commoner. Together we can defeat the power-hungry Imagawa. Let's celebrate! - Koroku, we'll seal this with a drink. Take it. - I accept with pleasure. - This is a good night. Back to the dance. - Before a battle of 4,000 against 40,000, it may look like he's dancing the night away. He is unfathomable. - It doesn't seem that Nobunaga will hold up in the castle and fight till the death... nor mobilize and defend the border. The time to attack Owari is at hand. So we ask the great lord to make the final decision. Are we agreed? - We have no objections. - Now is the time. - We are in agreement. - We ask the great lord. We await your decision. - Thank you for attending the war council. I now reveal my war plan. Owari is merely an obstacle. My objective is to ride into Kyoto. It would be easy to sweep Owari aside. But to show the world how powerful I am, we need to awe and shock with our army and make my presence clear. So even within our own domain, the army shall be in full armor, look disciplined so that all of Japan will know my might. MAY 1, 1560 IMAGAWA GIVES MARCHING ORDERS AND HIS ENTIRE ARMY LEAVES SUNPU. - Hold the banners high! Keep up the pace! Keep the flags flying! Our outpost castle is near. Step lively! BY NOBUNAGA'S ORDER, NO ARMOR TO BE WORN - They're coming! The advance troops have already passed Okazaki. - What? Has something interesting happened? Hey, everyone. It's okay to take off your clothes. No need to get ready until the enemy comes. Take a nap. MAY 18, 1560 IMAGAWA ARRIVES AT HIS OUTPOST CASTLE. IT IS ONLY 6 MILES FROM THE OWARI BORDER. - The army will cross the border and begin the attack tonight. I will leave here with the main army at 8:30 AM. l intend to be in Nobunaga's castle by evening. Tell everyone about the plan. -Imagawa's army is in Kutsukake Castle. - Our outpost castles will be surrounded tonight. - Do we do nothing? - Mori-dono. - Thank you, everyone. The lord says to retire and get some sleep. - Will I end as Owari's fool or will I rule Japan? - My lord, your bed is ready. - O-No... - Sleep. You are not a full-fledged samurai warrior if you can't. - What time is it? - It's 2:00 AM. - O-No, take the drums. “The lifespan of a man is 50 years... “Compared to the lives of the gods and monsters, it is but a fleeting dream... “I exchange my clothes for a monk's black robe... “Once given life, all things must die." Move out! O-No, bring my armor! - Bring the lord's armor! - Blow the conch! Blow it! We're moving out! - Move out! The lord is moving out! - We're moving out! - Bring the saké. This is how war is fought! - My lord! - Move out! Move out! - 1 will go with you! - Hurry, Manchiyo! You're falling behind, you idiot! Hurry! - Manchiyo-sama! - Go! - Sir, the people who live nearby would like to pay their respects to our lord. - All right. Stop the procession. - Halt! Halt! - Why are we stopped? - People wishing to pay respect, my lord. - 1 don't have to see them. Don't let down your guard. You tell them that I am full of compassion and won't treat the farmers badly. It's hot and dusty. Let's get going. - Urgent message! We have just taken Marume Castle and Washizu Castle. - Marume and Washizu. That's good. Tell those brigades to head straight for Kiyosu Castle. How weak Oda's front line is. - It's Marume Castle. - Washizu has fallen, too. - Wait, my lord! Please wait! - What? - If those two have fallen, Tange and Zenshoji are vulnerable. We should wait to see where he attacks next. - Silence! I don't need instructions on how to die. - Message! - Speak! As you are! - We've just taken Zenshoji. - You did? All right, take Tange next. What is the powerless Oda doing? - Zenshoji's general and 300 of his men have all died fighting. - Message! - Speak! - Message for our lord! Attacked by ten times our strength, I regret to report that Tange has... - Hold on! - Imagawa mustn't take Kiyosu Castle. - What? They all fought to their death at Tange? It was worth coming out here in this heat. Let's have a good rest at Kiyosu Castle tonight. Miura, proceed. - Reporting! Another group has come to pay their respects. - What shall we do, my lord? - I assume they were all waiting for me to come. Perhaps I shall say a word to them. - They will be very pleased. - All right. Let our men rest a while as well. That forest will shield us from the sun. Take the palanquin there. My armor is soaked through with sweat. - Message for Lord Nobunaga! Permit me to speak from my horse! My spies mixed in with the farmers paying respect report Imagawa is resting in the forest of Dengaku and the troops are now having lunch. - What? That's good! Koroku, as my previous instructions, get all the bandits and farmers together, arrange them in the fields near Imagawa, and make as much noise as they can. - Yes, my lord! - Men, entrust me with your lives! Today is May 19th, 1560. This could be the anniversary of our deaths. Do your best so that our descendants will be proud! Will I end as Owari's fool or become the ruler of Japan? Gramps... Here I go! - Our victory is a foregone conclusion. Give the men the saké that the farmers brought. We'll rest then head for Kiyosu Castle. It looks like we'll get some refreshing rain. - Men, there'll be no more bad news! Look at the weather. It is an omen for us, to ride as fast as the wind! Victory is ours! Furl the banners. Don't make a sound! Follow me! Our target is only Imagawa. Fight with all you have! Gods of Atsuta witness our bravery! Death is a certainty. Follow me! - Men, charge and attack! - My lady! - Tell me. Is the enemy at our door? - Rejoice! We are victorious! - What? We won? And where is our lord? - He's on his way back here with the head of Imagawa Yoshimoto. - So he won...! My lord... My lord. Congratulations. - My weakling wife, you are crying. - Say what you will. I am your weakling wife. - O-No, embrace me. Is that all you have? Stronger. I won... I won! - My lord... Both your father and Gramps Hirate are rejoicing your victory in heaven. - I wanted them to see it. But O-No, my battle is not over. My battle has just begun. Will I end as Owari's fool... or will I rule Japan? - My lord! THE END THE END Special thanks to Tajima and Ichiban Subtitled by: Samurai Warlord Productions
