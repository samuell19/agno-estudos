THE NATIONAL DEPARTMENT OF CINEMA PRESENTS A SPANISH NEWS BULLETIN One means of driving the Reds into the Ebro consisted of taking control of the Pando Valley, located to the southeast of Ganderas. The infantry moves ahead along terrain which stronger men would find impassable. Such are the advances made by our troops that the enemy is losing its natural fortresses one by one. The Reds defended the heights perfectly, against any infantry except the Spanish. Beneath these piles of stone and earth rest men which the "Internationale" brought to our lands to fight against Spain. Here is what they were reading when they met their death. How far was Leon Blum from all danger then. These Legionnaires embarking in Cadiz, enroute to noble, imperial Italy are now and forever wedded to our heroic cause. The Italian Legionnaires were seen off in El Caudillo's name, by General Quiepo de Llano of the Southern Command and the honourably injured, General Mill?n-Astray. THE GIRL OF YOUR DREAMS The National Socialist Party Congress honouring the Great Germany, has shown the world the miraculous progress of a nation like no other in history, in five years of National Socialist rule. The acclaim and strides of the National Socialist Party make a spectacle which will not be easily forgotten by those who have witnessed them, underscoring the confidence which the German people have placed in Adolf Hitler. Youth from the Labour Service, girls from the Youth Corps and the Workers' Coalition display vim and vigour. Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels and General Espinosa Monteros, head of the Spanish delegation at the Nuremberg Congress, representing Spain. Observe a squadron of the Arab cavalry. These splendid riders under the orders of Spanish officers who normally escort El Caudillo in official ceremonies, are subjected to rigorous training to achieve a mobility which confers harmony and discipline to their movements. "Life is soldiering and should be lived with the proper spirit of service and sacrifice. " This beautiful phrase of Jose Antonio was not uttered in vain. Youth of the New Spain receives inspiration from El Caudillo, is trained in the open air at proper camps, and learns to serve through discipline and work. Pilar Primo de Rivera, who has been in Germany where she was received by the F?hrer, has invited one of the leaders of the National Socialist Party Youth Corps, Dr. Uta Rudiger to visit the feminine branch of the Falange. In a bullring destroyed by the rage of criminal bombs, the first bullfight was held following liberation of the city. At this spectacle, the famous matador Juan Belmonte performed with great art, displaying unequaled skills with several bulls. In another example of Spanish-German cooperation, a troupe of Spanish actors has left for Berlin to film a super-production titled, "The Girl of Your Dreams", directed by Blas Fontiveros. It will feature his latest discovery: The new star of film and song, Macarena Granada and Juli?n Torralba, who was wounded at the front. Joining these stars, is the first lady of Spanish theater, Rosa Rosales, and the lovely Luc?a Gand?a. Before leaving their country, these patriotic actors are waved off by the producer and creator of this project, Mr. Noberto Cantero, and authorities of the Movement, Church, and the embassy of the Third Reich. We wish success to "The Girl of Your Dreams", the brainchild of German Propaganda Minister, Joseph Goebbels. With this project, we want to show our people the values of genuine German art. So that our people can cross the noble paths of culture. German actors bow with respect and gratitude to the F?hrer, whose artistic genius gave German politics its spirit, and whose politics... Bloody fly! ...gave German art its passionate impulse. Mr. Maisch, one of our finest directors, has volunteered to provide us with his professional advice. Only this paragraph needs to be repeated. Everything's ready, doctor. Great! What are we waiting for? Attention. Lights! Silence, please! That's enough. I don't have much time. Camera! Please, Doctor! German actors as a whole bow with respect and gratitude before the F?hrer whose artistic genius gave German politics its zealous spirit and whose politics gave German art its passionate impulse. Stop. Is it alright? This time without the fly? It's enormous. Like everything in Germany. Fontiveros, good to see you again. How was your trip? Mr. Hippel is happy to see you and asks about your trip. - Yes, of course. - Horrible. Rosa Rosales. Vaclav Passer. Your translator. Marcos Bonilla with Spanischen Produktion. Juli?n Torralba. Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler. Luc?a Gand?a. Vaclav. My job is to not lose you. Well, don't "lose" us, sweeetie. Donato Castillo, Set Decoration. Macarena! - Macarena Granada. - Good morning. - Trinidad Moreno. - Hi, how are you? Hey, you'll damage the trunk! The dresses are in there. Shit! Hush! Who's that? Hitler? - No, no, it's Minister Goebbels. - Propaganda Minister. And me dressed like this. We should have passed by the hotel first. Heil Hitler! Juli?n Torralba, at your service. Smile. Don't you know who it is? How am I going to smile? My face is frozen. - What a shame! I wanted to say hello. - Me too. I think he fancies cinema. Fancy is an understatment. Everyone, business before pleasure. Mr. Hippel says we should work. No, no, Trini... I haven't touched it, and neither has... Fontiveros, have you seen that mosque? What's he saying? He doesn't like it? Mr. Hippel asks if there's a problem. Uh, it's expressionist. Very expressionist. But Andalucia, what can I say, has... a different tone and colour... Our decorator has done what was specified. The decorator has done what he was told. Sure, sure. I can imagine. What's this "1001 Nights"? Only the camels are missing. Here. And this? An Andalusian tavern. Scenes 14, 22, 33... Fontiveros, how am I going to give this ambience. It looks more like a scene out of "Dr. Caligari". - Castillo, work your magic. - That's what you get paid for. Yeah, it's dead easy... Perfect? Yeah, absolutely perfect. What else can I say? Amazing. This beats Hollywood any day. Talk about power! Yeah, power, but I still haven't seen the canteen. Well, honestly a cup of java would really pick me up after that long flight. Well, as a star you have no equal. This looks like Ronda the way I look like Tarzan. Let's not get so uppity. Compare this with the Omni Studios on Bravo Murillo. There crocodiles tickled your feet during make-up. Blas! This man won't leave me alone. It's Franz Maisch, director of the German version. Mr. Maisch, Herr Fontiveros. A pleasure. I hope you like my technical script. Mr. Fontiveros, he hopes... I've directed more films than you. I don't need a Spaniard telling me what to do. Mr. Maisch is a director of vast experience... I suppose you would like to meet the leading man of the German version, our great actor, Heinrich von Wermelskirchen. Mr. Maisch, excuse me, everything's ready. We can start whenever. Yes, a moment please. Mr. Maisch wants to introduce the male lead in the German version, the great actor, Heinrich Wemelskirchen. Man, the guy who's playing me. Let's check him out. Attention, attention. Mr. Hippel says they'll use this set to do the jump scene. He agreed with Norberto to save on construction. I don't mean to differ but how is this similar to the hills of Ronda? Castillo, stick in a few shrubs and rocks. It's just a touch-up. Listen, Fontiveros. I'm supposed to jump from way up there? Yeah, it's the scene where the French dragoons are chasing you. Silence, please. Rolling. Camera! 105, take three. Heavens! What a hunk of a man! And what features. As if he was sculpted in bronze. So what, I eat everything. You're such a slut. I'm not the one devouring him with my eyes. I look at the actor. As an actor he looks great. Just take a look at him. "Anneliese, I love you. " Men are like melons... No comment, until I taste them. - Besides, I'm in love. - With who, Fontiveros? You think we're all as trashy as you... Be quiet... Wonderful, Bravo! I want to introduce the Spanish troupe. Luc?a Gand?a, to serve you body and soul. - Luc?a Gand?a... - Leave it, Vaclav. Don't translate idiocies. Macarena, your partner Heinrich. A pleasure. Fontiveros! I'm not fucking jumping from here! What happened? He asks what happened to his arm. Shrapnel. Tell him the Reds wounded him at the front. The front? Probably a jealous husband. Wounded at the front. He says he's pleased to meet a war hero. The pleasure is mine. Juli?n Torralba. He'd like to see - one of your films. - Of course, Blas! How about "Capitan de los Tercios de Flandes"? - No, I'm not in that one. - OK, "La Hija de Califa". I'll call Marciano to send it - by diplomatic pouch. - I don't know, Blas. - I wear a mask all the time. - Better for you. Tell him he can see "La Hija de Califa", with Juli?n as an Arab sheik. And I sing and play a Christian princess. He asks if you speak German. There could be work here for you. I'll learn German and whatever it takes. Tell him. Now, you'll see... "Do you love me?" "Feel my heartbeat," "galloping towards you like a wild horse... " "It's in your hands to control" "it with a caress... " "but if you shun it... " "I, myself, will keep it forever. " They're lines from the film. - Did I do it well? - You were great, honey. That bitch scared me. What'd he say? Nothing. He praises your pronunciation. Thanks. I have a good ear. I'm lost without lines. My English is better. We were planning on going to Hollywood... but with the war... Hollywood, that cesspool of global Judaism. Here, they frown on Hollywood. It was the Americans who wanted us. Juli?n, do you want to join me in my dressing room to talk shop? The gentleman would like to continue discussing the projects with Juli?n in his dressing room. Go, go on. Here in Germany, camraderie among actors is the accepted thing. Great actor. Big star in Germany. And a great companion, just look the way he's lavished all his attention on Juli?n, so openly. He's coarse and sly, that's what he is, like all the Germans. I'm heading home. Yes, Mr. Norberto! - No... - Is it Mr. Norberto? For the moment, there are no extra expenses. We saved on the taxi because they sent a bus to pick us up. - Bonilla... - By bus. Ask him about my father... Miss Granada asks how her father is doing. With Mr. Norberto's contacts, your father will be free in a week. Of course, dear. Don't you know Mr. Norberto is a dedicated fascist? Let's say he's rightist, a Germanophile. He's on it... Yes, Mr. Norberto. If he doesn't get my father out of jail, I'm out of here. Mr. Norberto promised me. Trini, give her a tour of the dressing rooms. And you, Vaclav, come with me to Mr. Hippel's office. - A tour? - Show her around. Give it to me. Here's Fontiveros. Would you be interested in an exclusive contract with UFA? UFA, yeah. I don't understand. Juli?n, let me invite you to dinner where you can meet some key people. And later... you could come home with me. That way I could give you private German classes... My little war hero! I can't believe it. Excuse me, could you let go of me please? I've got to go, but I'll be right back. This way. Blas! Don't leave me alone with that pervert. Bloody queer! No kidding. Sure your lack of German didn't betray you? What German? He took off his clothes and grabbed me! I'm leaving. Do you want to ruin my film on the first day? What if we lose him? - Your problem. - And yours. - No Heinrich, no film. - Then offer your ass! I should've brought Rivelles or Roberto Rey... Fontiveros, I wasn't born yesterday. I refuse to be alone with him. Look, you know what we'll do? Take the translator with you. Make it look official. Hey, Vaclav, go with him or he'll devour him. Devour him? Tell them to study. Above all, English. It'll help them leave Spain in the future. It's time to think about living abroad. You can't imagine the difference. Yes, right... Yes, dear... I have to go. Someone's at the door. Right, I'll call later. This is expensive. A kiss and one for the kids. Bye. Coming, hang on. I warn you, Blas, if that guy tries it on again, I'll hammer him. Juli?n, I can't believe you. Just string him along. And when he gets you the contract at UFA, drop him. - That's why I'm going to dinner. - It's better than fighting in Spain. Hey, for my country I'll give my life and whatever's necessary. - Except my ass, of course. - Sure, sure... But, you're an actor above all else This film will be a springboard for you. Ok, but not a word to the rest. Please, Juli?n, you know me. Treat him like a comrade and no violence. Off you go. What do you want, Fontiveros? She's not in the mood. Trini, do me a favour, don't be a pain and let me in. - Trini, don't let him in! - See? Says she can't stomach the Germans. Ah, it's because of that actor? I can explain that. Let me by. - Please! - You'll be the death of me. It's a beautiful restaurant - very near here. - Bonilla, you win by persistence. The owner knows Spain and has promised some really tasty lentils. Ever hear of champagne and caviar? Really... lentils! - I thought you'd miss... - I've just got here! Telegram for Mr. Fontiveros! Give it to me. I'm from Production, Danke danke. - A tip. - I don't have any change. What a face when Trini asked for 50 litres of milk! She got a bit carried away... Mae West in "Radio Cinema" said it was great for the skin. Really? Can I get in too? Stop it, will you! I'm restraining myself from jumping in. You've got one thing on your mind. And I love you. And you look beautiful... Silly! - Fontiveros, a telegram! - He's not here. Out, out, out... Fontiveros, Fontiveros... What's up, Bonilla? What? I was here with Macarena. Going over the lines... A telegram from the Spanish Embassy. A gala in our honour. Next Saturday? Fine. Hey, what a fuss! Spaniards always have to create such a scandal! Uh, nobody having dinner? I'm dying of thirst. I'm parched. Bonilla knows a place where they serve lentils. Lentils, yummy! Baby, I'd have thought of something more intimate. Bonilla, the important thing is unity among the group. God, who thought of this? I'm OK, I just slipped. You should have drowned. Here's your lentil soup. Ummm, lentils! - Ummmm! - I'm starving! The plates. A little. Anybody seen Juli?n? Yeah, where's our leading man? Oh, Juli?n. Don't you know? The German is smitten and has offered him a contract at UFA. What are you saying? Tha, that hunk is a queer? What a waste! I would never have suspected Juli?n. Why the surprise? Remember the Greeks and their obsession with physical beauty? No jokes about Juli?n. He's got a temper. What, love at first sight? I'm shocked. Castillo, shut up! I know you. You're a walking scandalmonger. Me? I'm like a clam. Bonilla, order another bottle of wine from that nice man. Must you always drink so fast? My dear, like Pepe Isbert says: "Punish the body and elevate the soul". Yuck! What kind of lentils are these? No sausage, no ear, nothing...! Christ! Let's go, come on... A Spanish film... Spanish! Don't cry, the hotel's not far. Bonilla, the Jewish quarter? Didn't you know the Germans hate them? How did I know? I don't go around checking foreskins! Maybe you should. - We leave one war for another. - How ironic! Bye. - Morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - You too. "What are you doing here, Antonio? Don't you see the soldiers?" "For you, my love. " "If my eyes can't see you everyday, I'd prefer to be blind. " "Don't say that my love. I melt like butter. " Cut, cut! - Uh, very good. - I didn't like this take. Fine... fine. Castillo! Castillo! I'm here fixing the mosque. How about the belltower? Yeah, very nice. Come down. And stick something in Juli?n's boots. Make him taller. right away. - I won't be able to walk. - OK, Darling. They won't hurt you... More light, Hans! I want to see the Andalusian sun! The guerrillas. Bonilla... - These are the guerrillas? - A dozen, like the script says. So, according to you, these are typical people from Ronda? Tall, blonde and blue-eyed? Well, look in the mirror. Spaniards are short, dark and ugly. Hair even grows on our tongues. That's German production for you. I want nothing to do with it. - With wigs, make up... - Yeah, and the Virgin Mary. Shit! My bunions are going to burst. Here, take off your shoes. I'll rub your feet. What's bugging you today? There's nothing wrong with me. Castillo, if you keep up the insinuations, you go back to Spain. Uh, what about these? You're the artistic director, right? Great-looking angels, but... no good. For this picture, that is. This is shit, Castillo. They'll kill me when we open in Spain. - My prestige ruined. - What prestige? He's here. Everyone in hierarchical order. Hierarchical order. Please, don't forget. Don't look at his gammy leg. He hates that. Heil Hitler! An extraordinary honour, my dear. Good evening. Welcome! I suppose you know Mr. Hippel, head of production at UFA. Heil, Hitler! Blas Fontiveros, one of our top directors. - It's a pleasure. - The pleasure is mine. And thank you for assisting this co-production, the first of many between our two countries. Macarena? I see you already know Macarena Granada, the most promising star of Spanish song. Dr. Goebbels knows and admires you. Thank you. Mucho danke. Spain. Yes, Spain. Heil, Hitler! Julian Torralba, our male lead. Injured in combat. Let's go inside before the ladies freeze. - Let's accompany the Doctor. - Yes. May everyone enjoy a splendid evening. The Doctor really enjoyed "La Hija del Califa", especially the songs. I'm lost for words. The young lady is speechless. - Well, Fontibre... how are you? - Fontiveros... Of course, Fontiveros. The minister is reknowned for his adoration of the fairer sex. - I didn't know... - Really, man. I'll just tell you that UFA is called "Goebbel's brothel". - No kidding. - Really. We happily sacrifice a woman's body for planes for the Movement. It is our patriotic duty. Besides, it's an honour that an eminent man like the doctor take an interest in our humble cinema. Come on Fontibre, look on the bright side. These are hard times. Hannibal, don't be so boorish with your stories. Fontiveros, please share some industry gossip. I love it. Thank you. Thank you. - Ham! - Anything to drink? Yummy! Ummm... this is from back home. The doctor was feasting on her with his eyes. - The girl's all-woman. - She may be all woman... but I don't play second fiddle to her or her mother. - It's not her fault, poor thing. - That was a snub, a real snub. Especially Juli?n, who's the real star of the film. - Of course. - Look at her. She's sticking her tits in the poor idiot's mouth. Use what you can. Don't I have tits? Want to see them? Luc?a, we're in a foreign country. This doesn't end here. Fontiveros will hear from me. Where is he? Blas! It's no use, Torralba. It was Dr. Goebbels himself who suggested to the ambassador to hold this reception for us. - The ambassador told me. - So what? Well, it's crystal clear. The Doctor has a crush on the little one. - You don't say. - Yes... And the ambassador has served her up like they used to for Fernando VII. So it was a set-up. Isn't Fontiveros going to do anything? - What should he do? - Make the most of it. - No, I never eat between drinks. - Spanish omelette. Mr. Torralba, why don't you tell me about the film? Well, it's the story of a guerrilla fighter in Sierra Morena... - My role... - No, not another about bandits. I'm fed up with typical Spanish films. All that confusion, Spanish sombreros and sideburns. Typical Spanish film? What should we do in Spanish cinema then? Typical German, Hungarian, American films? I don't mean that. Compared to foreign films, you won't deny that... Well, Mrs. Ambassador, I find the character El Tempranillo more interesting than Al Capone. Well, I agree. But only if played by Mr. Torralba. Oooh, the wound... Please, Juli?n... I don't know if I dare. You're a screen legend to me. Legend? I'm flesh and bone. - Nothing more. - And nothing less. Thank you. For you, my beautiful and great artist. Cheers! The Doctor suggests your future is here in Germany. With him. But I... am contracted to Fontiveros. The Doctor would like to have dinner with you to get to know you better. I'm sorry but I'm very busy. The Doctor begs you not to be curt with him. Curt? God, no. Thing is, I return to Spain tomorrow. - Why? - Because it's all a mess. The set, the extras... there's no production. Nothing. It's shite! She feels that in order to stay, a few small production problems need to be solved. Production? Hippel, Hippel, come here right now. Hippel, I demand at once a complete list of production deficiencies and in writing, hear me? Make a right at the end. Then take the hall on the left. Thank you. Thanks. This is just perfect. Torralba! This is like a match made in heaven. Fontibre, have you seen my wife? No, no. But I was looking for you. Could you introduce me to Emil Jannings? We'll try, but I must confess I don't know him personally. Besides, he's reported to have a wicked temper. Really? Yes? Now, what's your problem? Luc?a, let me in a moment. I know your moments. Don't do this to me. I'm overheating. Oh, darling, come in, but remember it's only because empty beds look so big to me. Macarena... - Honey, you asleep? - Yes. What a night, eh? Rosales, drunk as a skunk, reciting classic Spanish repertory to Germans. Juli?n romping with that floozie, the ambassador's wife, and your fling... You're not getting into bed after what happened. You need thicker skin... Thick skin? That sleazy bastard drivelled all over me, and what did you do? Aren't you confusing his admiration for you, as an artist? Bonilla told me that 'Go-balls' tries to bed all the actresses. What does he know? He knows. With that dictionary, he picks up everything. I'm invited to dinner... Bonilla? Bonilla? No, Go-balls. It's your fault. If we were married, he'd have more respect. And my wife and kids? What do you want me to do with them? You know what? I'm going home. Are you crazy? If you go, there will be reprisals. Your Dad will be shot for sure. Sorry, don't be silly. This will be an enormous boost for your career. You'll see at the premiere. The film... is all you care about. Fontiveros! Open up! I'll kill you, you bastard. - I'm going to kill you. - Juli?n, for heaven's sake. Easy, it was a misunderstanding. Juli?n, no scandals, for Pete's sake. For Spain. Who told this degenerate I was involved with the German queer? It's a lie, a lie. A lie? So he comes into my room bare-assed. What's wrong? I was reviewing lyrics with Macarena. I'm not a homosexual. Get it right, Juli?n. I'm homosentimenal. I was looking for our German mate... Look... everyone, listen in. I'm more man than anyone. Any doubts and I'll smash your heads in. Oooh, I'm shaking. You want me to fuck you to death right here? Who you? - Juli?n, calm down. - Anyone can talk big. It's bad enough having to put up with that slobbering German and not smash his face in. But I don't because of the production. Clear, very clear. Now I'll go to bed more relaxed. Trini, come to my room so I can sleep. Ah, the party continues. - Why are you staring? - Nothing. Going to tear my eyes out? Why don't you come with me so you can tell everyone. We believe you, Juli?n. My pleasure... sorry, Bonilla. Another time. Oh, great! Come on, everyone to bed. We're here to make a film in case you don't remember. Slut... Slut... How do you say slut? Here it is: F?chsin Strassendirnel! Come with me to have one last drink. I'm awake now. Come, come in. Don't make a scene. Like the guerrillas? A present from Dr. Goebbels. They look like Spaniards. Fontiveros will love them. Look at that one, a gypsy from Granada. What eyes! Cut! No, no! You've missed three lead-ins. Three, that's all? You're not concentrating! How can I concentrate with this fake Spanish music? And with these morons? Have you seen the way they clap? How do I explain the fucking spirit of flamenco to prisoners of war? Bonilla, stop the record! It's driving me mad! Stop. What's wrong with them? Must be from the hot lights. What heat, they've been sipping wine every take and this is the 15th! - You can't use real wine. - And on an empty stomach. Bonilla, get them out of here. - Come on. - No, no, no. Let them sleep. They look drunk. It's better that way. But tell the others not to drink, just to fake it. Uh, no, I'm a professional. If I must drink, I drink. Shit, Rosales, you too...! Sorry, I was just trying to liven things up. Given how dead everything is. Blas, give me 5 minutes. I just need to rehearse. Let's see. Vaclav, come here, love. Bonilla, cut for 5 minutes. Five minutes! I have the German part ready. This one looks a bit of a tart. Come on, everyone, palms together! Like this. Hollow hands like castanets. Your hands have to be silent, with rhythm. One, two, three, one, two, three. That's it. You're not calling the night porter. Like gypsies from Utrera! Ole y arsa pilili! Ole y arsa pilili? I'm afraid I can't translate that one. Oh no? Bonilla, the dictionary. Hey, it isn't an encyclopaedia! Let's go! Where's your sense of rhythm, love? What did he say? He says... he isn't a clown. Don't worry. He'll be gone soon. No, no. A temper? We have to start somewhere. Let's see... Rhythm has to come from the heart. Are you a Jew too? Yes, Russian Jew. Well, we're all family here. Try this one, try it. Have to hand it to them. These Germans make extraordinary drinks That suit looks fabulous on you. Although we have made love You must give me my own breathing space. If I'm bothering you, tell me and I'll go. Off you go, then. I need air. See how easy? I'm gone. Try this concoction, dear. The best thing for sorrow is to drown it. Let me thank you Bonilla, but between the sheets. I'm sure you can appreciate it more than others. Take one. Thank you, perfect, Macarena! The take's good. Thank you. Thank you. You were good. Did you like it? Look, it's Jannings. They respect veteran actors here, unlike in Spain. Look at me, ignored, only given mere supporting roles as if I was a hopeful young actress. Amusing picture. You've come out well in this magazine. Let's see. It's just so easy for some to reach the top. Don't listen, honey. You look beautiful in it. If Daddy could only see me. - Will it reach the jail in Seville? - Of course, dear. Franco's jails are not like those Reds' prison cells. What pisses me off is that my films have been removed from all the Republican zones. Now they think I'm a pro-Nazi director. Jealous of your international fame. All the screens are now state-owned. You wouldn't see a penny. But why do they have to delve into politics? I direct films, that's all. It doesn't work like that. To catch fish, you have to wet your ass. It's Franco or the Reds. Hey, we're all with Franco here, aren't we? Right, and if you don't agree, you should be in jail or shot. Shit, Trini, I don't make films with Reds. Enough! I told you before we left, politics remain in Spain. He says he has a message from Dr. Goebbels for Macarena. Christ! It's in German. I hope you can join me this evening for a private dinner. I'll send a car to pick you up at your hotel... What an honour! Dr. Goebbels invites me to translate. See, you won't be alone. Vaclav, take care of her. I'm just a translator. Do I have to say yes? You can't refuse. He'll cancel the shoot. I see. Just open your legs and Germany will open its arms to you. Hey, hey! Stop! Can't take you out of Spain! Stop it! Cut it out, you two. Can't you see everybody's staring? Let me go! "And these things you'll see/ if in this house you be/ at least six times/ per week. " By Zorrilla. Sure, that's why the Germans look down on us. They think we're cavemen. Good morning. Haven't you eaten? Neither gypsies nor jews can enter the canteen. I don't understand a word. "Princess of Spanish cinema. " Princess, yeah. Here, dear? Come on. Fontiveros says you should eat. There's a lot of work ahead. Sure, can't slow the shoot down, can we? - And these people? - These? Stay out of politics. Look what happened to your father. I'm not hungry. That bitch took my appetite away. So here, this is for you. Watch it, Macarena. - What's the matter? - What's... I know you as if your were mine. - You like the Jew. - He's Russian. Well, whatever. But if he's a prisoner, he must have done something. - Hey! - Back! Don't push me or I'll slap you, eh? They're prisoners. - Careful, Macarena. - I'll complain to production. No, Dr. Goebbels. He's a friend of mine. And I'll have you cleaning the studio toilets. Move! You'll see. - You're beautiful. - I wish I wasn't. Remember, close your legs and keep smiling. And when things get heavy, start yawning and come back to the hotel. Bye. Good evening. The minister hasn't arrived yet. - Good evening, miss. - Good evening. Come, please. Looks very quiet tonight. Good evening. My dear... The Doctor excuses himself for the delay. The Doctor has seen what you've filmed so far. And he says no German woman could ever dance like you. No more holding hands, I hate mushy moments. You're beautiful, Macarena. Macarena, we are building the best cinema in the world. We've made an offer that even Garbo can't refuse. She'll also work for us. The Doctor says he's made an offer to Greta Garbo to come and work in German cinema that she can't refuse. Garbo's coming? We'll find great films for you. Pictures worthy of you. Famous historical figures like Isabella of Castille. The great Spanish queen who expelled all the Jews from Spain. The Doctor says you'd interpret Isabella of Castille who expelled the Jews from Spain. Again, the Jews. What did they do to you? And the gypsies? Anything against them? I'm half-gypsy. The young lady asks if the Jews and gypsies... Dr. Goebbels says he didn't come to discuss politics. No, I know that. He's come here to screw me, but we'll see about that. If I have any say in it. Tell them I'll put everything except fear into them. Shit, how do I write that? You don't know how bad I feel about Macarena giving her all for the picture. To Goebbels! Seems like the right thing. You even joke about that! I'm just trying to lighten things up. Besides, invalids are famous for being great lovers. Remember Lord Byron, to name one. They haven't got a clue. Come on, silly, don't cry. We are all homesick. The things I did to get this role. You all know. I can tell by the way you look at me. It's okay, baby. Everyone cons their way into film somehow. Yeah, but you didn't have to suck Norberto off, he's disgusting. Oooh, don't make me vomit. Can I ask you a personal question? How personal, Rosales? Macarena and you...? And you put up with the limp idiot? The Doctor insists that the hotel is not good enough for a star like yourself, so please accept his offer of a house... Tell him I don't know. I must discuss it with Fontiveros. The Doctor requests that you forget Fontiveros. He's neither your husband nor your father. He adds that you should aspire to better directors. He will arrange your move tomorrow. Damn it, I've broken my heel. I'm going. You are a nymph, a mermaid... This man's a leech. Don't translate that... Tell him I get up early tomorrow and must return to the hotel. He says he'll order a change in the work plan. God, no, no! I have to get back. Look, how tired I am... The Doctor says you can go, but first you must sing him a song. A song, now? Well, if it's only a song, OK. But then I leave. Let's see. "I ask you nothing/ I owe you nothing/ I'm leaving your side, forget me already/ I've paid in gold/ Your dark skin/ Don't curse me, man, we're at peace now. / I don't love you/ Don't love me/ If you gave it to me/ I never asked for it/ Don't tell me now/ that you lost everything/ I, too, lost it all/ by your side/ Bye. What happened? Caviar, champagne, the whole restaurant for us. We danced. Right. He wants to put me in a chalet. He says that's how Marika R?kk and Zarah Leander live. Tell me not to do it, Blas. Macarena, this is a once-in-a lifetime chance. Who knows if we'll be able to make films again in Spain. The war could last. Right. The film's everything, right? Well, yes. Although I've made 22. They're all forgotten in a few years. Don't say that... Go ahead, sleep. Tomorrow's a busy day. Oh, Blas... if only you were good in bed... if only you knew how to fuck me... Yes, Mr. Norberto. What are you saying? We're in the projection room... Yes. Yes, Mr. Norberto. I'll tell him now... It was Norberto. - What's that bore got to say? - It's about Macarena's father. He died of pneumonia two days ago in jail. Don't tell anyone. I'll find the right moment. These extras... are great. Yes, great. Wonderful. Nice chalet! Stolen from a Jew, no doubt. - You see, you'll be fine here. - Enough, Blas. Two weeks will fly, dear. Don't worry. Oooh, caviar! I've heard so much about it, but never tried it. Let's go to Spain, Blas. And waste our careers? You really don't care what that dwarf does, do you? That dwarf, as you call him, is one of Europe's most powerful men. - Goebbels? - Yes. Trini, watch her. I'll do what I can. Oh, Trini. Saw it by chance in a window display. And I immediately thought of your marvellous neck. May the precious bond with the beautiful. What is this man saying? These are not gifts; these are heirlooms. Excellency, I'm going to prepare some hot tea... Talk, dear. Don't stop talking. Everything's very nice. Precious. You shouldn't have bothered. The chalet was enough. By the way, Fontiveros loved it. Says the air's great out here. He liked it so much, he'll probably be back. Fontiveros, that is. Don't start in with him again. I can't stand hearing his name. That man is getting on my nerves more and more. Wouldn't you prefer to see the rest of the house together? I've seen the bedroom. It's lovely. With bed and everything. But we're just fine here. Want to eat something? I'll have Trini whip you up some rice and clams. She's like a mother to me. My Mother died when I was 3. Do you know Malaga? Don't talk so much and let me eat you whole. I'm going to check on the tea. Look, I don't know about the Germans. But in Spain we take our time. It isn't that I don't like you, but in two or three years, if the relationship's stable... Your breasts, your breasts! Come, give them to me! - Give me them. - No, stop! Goddamn it, no! Here's the tea. Drink it before it gets cold. I don't want any tea now. Get out of here! This man should be tied up. Trini, God. Virgin of Macarena! Enough stupidities! Trini! Doctor... What, Henkel? Not now. The F?hrer is on the radio. You're summoned at once to the Chancery. Always the most inopportune moments. I can't believe it. What, Henkel? Let's go! Goodbye, ladies. Trini, I want to die. It doesn't look good. Why don't we go back to Spain? And leave the film and Fontiveros? Think of my father... I want to die, Trini. No, dear, no. That's the last resort. And there's plenty of time for that. - Bonilla, can we shoot? - Nothing is impossible. They're removing the snow and the camerman says it's 10 minutes to nightfall. He might've worked with Murnau, but he is one pain in the ass. Precisely. Since we haven't filmed when you get shot by the soldiers, how many holes are right? You make the holes. They'll need a lot of lead to kill me. Bonilla, bring ice. When they open their mouths, you see their breath. They could provide a heater. You should have picked another profession. This is a job. Ignore him, dear. When he gets in one of his moods, he's unbearable. Hollywood may be full of Jews, but surely it has better weather. I was with Amelia Mu?oz at Paramount Studios in Joinville. Oh, Joinville... Pretending it was snowing on some street in Seville. Ooh, how pretty! Poor thing caught a cold and died right there. What a tragedy. Ugly thing, she was. Very ugly. Good evening. How are you? Vaclav. Come here, we can't communicate. Ask him... if all Russians are so good-looking. Macarena, don't stray. He says... that Jews aren't welcome here. Yeah. See Trini? He's in jail for being a Jew. That girl... Twenty, spades. He says he worked as a trapeze artist in a travelling circus. He says when he tried to escape a German policeman was hurt... Oh, and he's a criminal too. You're like a magnet for trouble, dear... Trini, you're such a pain. What else? How can spades fail...? Trini, you just called, "twenty". Who me? - Of course. - You drink! Everybody out. We're about to film. Attention, camera! Silence, please. Camera! Action! "Antonio," "don't leave me alone. " "You're everything to me. " "What am I going to do without you?" "You're my night and day and the air I breathe. " "Antonio, please. " "Antonio, it's me. " "I'm the girl of your dreams. " Cut! Macarena, he's just died, for God's sake. Sounds like you're reading a letter from your aunt. More passion. As if you know passion. My kidneys are cold. Let's do another. Shit! Nice night awaits us, Bonilla. She's lost respect for him too. As the saying goes, "Don't fool around with skirt where you work. " Mrs. Goebbels wants to see you. - Me? - Yes, it's urgent. Now? It's the minister's wife. You can't refuse. - Bonilla, cut for dinner! - You mean snack. We're cutting for dinner! Let's see how it turned out. I used venison instead of rabbit. The rice must be just right. Spanish paella for everyone. Love for one's country leaves me dry. What I miss is Rioja wine. Don't trivialize, Rosales. One's country is like one's mother. Jos? Antonio said so. The UFA matter is moving along on schedule. Oh, yes. This guy's a bit of a pain, isn't he? No "nein", no nothing. They can eat here too. No Jews in the dining room. Trini, serve them. - This is not well-seen. - Tell them not to look. Paella! Paella! Try it. Calm down. See how you've stirred things up, Macarena. Tell the girl not to resist the Doctor's advances. That's what most excites a man. She should provide the Doctor with as much physical pleasure as she can muster. But madam asks that you warn her about getting pregnant. Madam will not be flexible. She says her husband has good taste like yourself. You and madam must be civilized and understanding. Look, if it's about the paella, go back where you came from. It's not that... it's about your father. They've freed him? No. He's died of pneumonia in jail. Who told him to become an anarchist with the lovely lottery stand he had? I can halt the shoot... though I think you should do what you do best and go out there. Reminds me of the day my husband died. I had two sessions of "La Malquerida"... I got drunk on gin... when... When you want, Fontiveros. Silence, we're filming. Camera... Action! "Don't leave me alone. " "Antonio, don't go. " "Don't you realize you're everything to me?" "What am I going to do without you?" "You're my night and day" "and the air I breathe. " "Antonio," "it's me. " "The girl of your dreams. " "What am I going to do without you?" "What am I going to do?" Cut! Even Garbo couldn't... Poor thing. Shit, Macarena! I almost burst into tears. We've cut. Nobody move. We have to do the German version. Let's see... bring out Heinrich. How are you? Yeah, I imagine. Of course, I wish I were with you... Macarena, we can't risk it, you know. Don't worry, he probably won't show. He's a very busy man. Get in bed and try to sleep. Big kiss. "Give up, dog!" "I'll die first. " "Long live, Spain!" Bravo. Fantastic! He's killed himself. Heinrich! What a fall! Shit, Blas. He fell wrong. God, something's broken. Where does it hurt? Oh! It had to be the neck. It's the neck, it's the neck! Bye. - What, they're leaving? - Yes. We're finished with the extras. Where are they going? Hollywood, where did you think? Leo! I hope we meet again. Thanks. Bye. - Shit, Juli?n. - No way I'm jumping. It was his fault. Who told the showoff to jump head first? He was unconscious. That occurred when Castillo offered to give him mouth-to-mouth. - We'll put more mattresses. - No, dammit! The wound in my arm could open. Now, why are you crying? Shit, use one of the Jews. Right, the trapeze artist... Leo? What if he kills himself? - The Germans willl kill him anyway. - Bonilla, get him dressed. Really, Fontibre, cinema's such a sham... So the guy jumping off the cliff is not Mr. Torralba? Why don't you jump Juli?n? My question exactly. A male lead should never take risks. - No? - No. They shoot the fall and then match it with my other shots. Besides, my wound... Does it hurt a lot? Blood spilt for God and country is never painful. So true... Aren't you in this scene, Madam Rosa? No, I leave adventure scenes to the young. They have better-looking bodies. - Bonilla, the guerrilla? - They're doing his sideburns. Juli?n, I would love to see the studio from the inside. To know all those in's and out's. Those interiors. With your husband's permission, I could show you. Can I, Hannibal? Sure, go. I'll stay with Fontibre. My wife had a deep longing to attend a film shoot. Of course. If you only knew how much I admire you, Madam Rosa. Thank you. Here's our hero. Hope it's a wide shot. Cause he looks like Chaplin in that jacket. You sure he wants to jump? Look at his face. He's thrilled. Upstairs. Everybody ready. Vaclav, have you told him his lines and what to do? Yes, he cries: "Long live Spain" and he jumps. The mattresses, Leo. Jump towards the mattresses. Relax, if he does it well, he gets a film credit. You weren't serious about a film credit, were you? No, it was to boost morale. Ready to shoot. Baby! Light the moon. Light, light. - There, perfect. - Stop! - What are they doing? - Watching the prisoners. Bonilla, get them out of the shot. Please, move over. You can't appear in the shot! No, Vaclav, more. Behind the dragoons. Please, stand back more. Behind the dragoons. Fine, attention, camera! Camera! Action! Long live, Spain! Why doesn't he jump? Come on, jump! Jump! - What's wrong? - The Jew's escaped. Nobody move. Hit the floor. Let's go. Come on. What are you doing? We're asking for trouble. Not that way. It's full of soldiers. - Where? - We have to get him out. Here, in here. Thanks. It's hardly the moment to kiss. Is he stupid or what? Come on. Damn, they're here. He says we're all arrested. Come, relax until order is restored. - You OK? - I was changing. - Bonilla's idea of using a prisoner. - Brilliant, as always. - Where's Juli?n? - Has anyone seen my wife? Virgin of Anguish! Christ of Sorrows, what are you doing to me? I'm a bitch. A hopeless slut. Oh, God. Oh, God. I have no forgiveness. Over more, right there! What are you doing, Juli?n? What a man, what a man! Virgin of Mary. All saints... And your arm? The war wound? Well, it was just a scratch. My agent exaggerated a little. - For publicity purposes, you know? - Yeah. Your call with Dr. Goebbels. Good morning, Mr. Minister. Yes, yes, yes... How long do we have to stay here? Everybody, against the wall. He's going to look around. - But, sir, some respect... - Against the wall! Don't argue, - he'll kill us. - As director, I warn you. Out, now! - Blas! - He hit the director. No, please. Silence. Spanish citizens! Are you OK, Blas? Down, but not out. What's all this? Why such harsh treatment? What are we criminals? Is all this about that prisoner? We're film people, artists. This is not our war. Expect to find him under a chair? Under these women's skirts? Behind this partition? Among the dresses, hanging in the closet? You really think he's hiding here? Where? In this trunk, under a... No... no. No. Rosales, that's cologne! One must make do... In Germany, we've done away with alcoholics. They're useless. Fontiveros, inform the ambassador. What's he going to do? Nobody leave here. I must request new orders. We can't move until there are new orders. Bonilla, watch the door. No one enters. Macarena, you want us all shot. She did a humane thing. What's wrong? What's wrong... what's wrong? I almost fainted when I opened this... Shit, the Jew... Why's he here? I haven't seen anything. I must go. Bonilla, nobody leaves. Vaclav, you're as Spanish as we are. I speak 12 languages. I have no country. I just want to stay alive. Have you gone mad? I demand an explanation. What could I do? This poor soul needed refuge. The bastard picked the perfect place. This man is an artist from our picture. He's one of us. We can't let them shoot him. Better they shoot him and not the entire cast. You all have no heart... And you should have less. What can we do? I really have to go. Help him escape. You're really going to just abandon him? We're filming a song-and-dance thing while a war is going on. That "thing", as you call it, feeds us all. This man is risking his life. You've seen how they treat people here... "This girl's dye should be cast anew/ like church bells that don't ring true. " They're here. We're all going to be shot... Stay calm. Bonilla, open up. He's here to take Macarena to the chalet. Only her. Dr. Goebbels orders. Tell him to wait, Vaclav. Now she leaves us here in the thick of it. He says it must be at once. One moment. I'll be right out. One moment, please. I know. I'll say I need the trunk, and we'll get him out. But they'll check the trunk... It's true. These Germans are very thorough. What's he doing? What, Leo? He's all rubber. Of course, he worked in a circus. He says close the trunk and take it out of here. But, remember, I've seen nothing. No one's seen anything, Vaclav. Got it? Castillo, you'll suffocate him! I have to do something. Call the chauffeur. Quick! Quick! This weighs a ton! Cut it out! Dr. Goebbels will kill us if anything happens to her. - You'll be safe at home... - Thank you... Torralba, the film world has always - driven me mad. - Naturally. Hannibal, my husband... Stand back! Who goes there? Hannibal, it's me! Where were you? Leaving me alone with this cinema riff-raff! Why the fuss, darling? I was looking for you. Why the gun? Do you always have to pull a gun? Relax, take it easy. This film business is all chaos. Take me home at once. Right, let's not return here. Out! Out! Here he is! Heil Hitler! It can't be... They've killed me. They've taken him. - What! And Macarena? - No problem. - She left with the chauffeur. - My little girl. My poor girl. She's a heroine, she is. A heroine. Poor girl... What about the Jew? So good-looking... Not to worry. When they shoot you, you don't even feel it. Bonilla, you brute. I've seen nothing. By the way, where's Juli?n? Bet he's humping the ambassador's wife. That stud will get his head blown off by the ambassador. Bonilla, we have to get a car. Macarena will surely get into trouble if left alone. What a mess, my friends. The case, don't forget the case... Come on, let's go. Right this way. This way. OK, good. Off you go. Thanks. I have orders to remain here. Go on, very good. Good bye. Poor thing. Jesus, he's dead. You have to be stupid to hide in there. What do I do now? Thank God, you're alive. Poor baby, you can't walk. Where are we? Why don't you speak in Christian? Where are you going? Can't you see someone's watching? I got it. You stay here, and when he enters... When he enters... Wham! You hit him on the head. You don't need to kill him. The guy's got to live too. Come, come here, my love. It's OK. What was I thinking? No, I was thinking maybe your head hurt. Let him go! I said let him go. Are you OK? Come on. Boy, are you slow. Take this off. Now the clothes, then take the car and you're free. Yes, the clothes. It's a shame you're always on the run. Cause I would love to roll in the sack with you. Sack? Never mind. Life's not fair... Just who we needed. Not this one, it's Go-balls. We'd really be screwed then. Come on, time to hide again. Let's take him upstairs. God, he's heavy. Take these. This time I don't want any interruptions. Understand? Oh yes, the flowers... Macarena? You wanted my body. Come and take it. And then go. It's the movie... Film... Not in German. Keep speaking in Spanish. It excites me more when I don't understand you. I'm going to make love to you like no one ever has. Are you crazy? You know what you've done? Oh, God. You're so beautiful it hurts to look at you. I don't understand you, but I'm sure it's lovely. Thank you. I imagined a slightly bigger house. Bonilla, pays for this one too. These are all extra expenses. Mr. Norberto... I don't know. What's up? Everyone hide. There are guards. I'm leaving. Taxi! - Don't yell, it's worse. - I don't want to know anything. Are you really going to leave that young girl alone? Don't shout! Yes. Let's go, Castillo. Come on, everybody inside. Let me go. - I'm going inside. - Watch it, Trini. - Blas, do we all have to enter? - Yes. What's this? "Madam, I'm dead tired/ I've seen a man jump/over the garden wall. " I shouldn't be here. Sounds like she's crying. Yeah, crying... She's upstairs in the bedroom. Right. Trini, you go first. Let's go. - I'll wait here. - Let's go. Really, Macarena. Oh, Trini. - Wasn't he dead? - Shit, the dead guy. He's alive and wagging his tail. Never said better. This one's lively. It's Dr. Goebbels. Heil Hitler! Is he dead? We'll all be shot. - We're fucked. - The film's over. Forget the film, Blas. I couldn't save Daddy, so let me help Leo escape. Who's going to help you escape? Because when Go-Balls wakes up... Right! For him, we've never been a part of the picture anyway. I'm leaving! Don't be afraid. It's the chauffeur. Not even the F?hrer can save us from this one. Macarena, isn't there anything to drink, love? We may still have a chance. Everyone to the car. We have to leave here. Vaclav. - Fontiveros, let me go. - No way. You translate all I say, without skipping a comma. Let me remind you that in matters concerning this film... It doesn't concern the film. Mr. Fontiveros wants to speak to you about your husband and Miss Granada. My husband? Yes, it seems your husband, Dr. Goebbels, has told Macarena he will leave you and run off with her. He's requested an ambassador post in Spain. It's as crazy to me as it is to you. So I've come to see you. I'm destroyed, understand me... She asks, what do you want. It's very simple. I love Macarena and you love your husband. If you get me the plane tickets, I'll leave tonight for Paris with Macarena and her maid. She asks if you love Macarena so much as to sacrifice your career for her. Because this certainly will be the end of your career. Now I see how dangerous that girl is. Wait here. Didn't you see her face? She'll be back with the Gestapo to shoot us right here. Take it easy, Vaclav. She swallowed it whole. I work in cinema, remember? Is it OK to just leave Goebbels there? His guards have surely found him by now. - And if he comes for dinner? - He doesn't live with her. She doesn't let him visit since his affair with that Czech actress. Damn right! Poor woman. The chauffeur's dead when Goebbels wakes up and finds him butt-naked. Poor chauffeur, it wasn't his fault. Stop feeling sorry for people. That just causes us problems. What's wrong? Dearie, hide that head or those soldiers will shoot it. Christ! She says a flight leaves for Paris in two hours and if we show this, we shouldn't have any problems. Thank you, thank you... She says she'll find a way to show her gratitude. Tell her not to worry. Quick, let's go. Everything's fixed. Well, goodbye everyone. Come on, the plane's leaving. Amazing, how men complicate our lives. Bye, dear. Bye. Take care, honey. Take care of yourself. Relax, nobody's going to mix us up in this affair. Right, don't waste time. Be happy. Thanks. I've always been jealous of you, you little tart. Here. For you. And you, relax. I've seen nothing. Good luck, Macarena. In Paris, you can get a connection to Argentina. My friends will find you work there. And the picture? It's always the same: The actress takes off with an extra... Don't say that! Our thing never had a future, and you know it. Blas! Come on, let's go. The plane's taking off, come on. Let's go! Let's go. Don't worry, when we get to Paris, we'll dump the Russian and re-start her career. Thanks. And, viva the social revolution! Viva! - I'm sick of those damn flags. - It's not even original. It's an oriental religious symbol meaning: Peace, love and happiness. Juli?n should hear you. Juli?n. If the Jew's on the plane, who did they grab thinking it was the Jew? I think that Juli?n is about to be shot. I must advise Hippel, the ambassador. Vaclav, Castillo, come with me. Everybody else back to the hotel to pack. The sooner we go, the better. Taxi! Hotel Palace. Blas! Juli?n, what happened? Shit, Castillo... they tortured me. Me, more fascist than anyone. - Dirty bastards. - It's over. Let's go home. The secret's out. The film has been cancelled. Of course, without Macarena... We'll be sent back to Spain. You have to remain here until everything is cleared up. Orders of Dr. Goebbels. Sorry. Don't worry, Fontiveros. I'll speak to Norberto. He'll fix things. Take care. Blas! When the war's over, we'll finish the picture in Madrid. Don't push, have a little respect. I'm the lead actress. Take the dictionary... I know all I need to. It may come in handy.
