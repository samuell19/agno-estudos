[projector clicking] [♪] [boy] I work in a dark and hot place. It's a theater. [metal clanging] The one in the student center... [metal clanging] [clattering] I was taking a nap up in the wait bay, but with all the lights on, the stage gets hot. My Physics professor, Dr. Von Nuremberg, says that being hot makes it less dense, so it rises up from the floor and into the rafters of the theater. -[indistinct chatter] -There's perfume in the air. Lots of it. All the different kinds that people wear mix together and float up on the thermal from the stage. It's enough to make you dizzy. It's because of all the girls down in the audience. Perfume makes me dizzy, period. It's a buzz. Like being stoned. But it doesn't make talking to girls very easy. Ivory soap, Noxzema, even Tide is a difficult situation. Perfume: rising and mixing. At the top of the rafters, there must be a permanent layer of it. Maybe like the ozone layer. Well, except that it would smell a whole hell of a lot better than the ozone layer, which I always imagine smelling a lot like your slot car set when you ran it too long. [woman whispering] Ozone. The scent of ozone. Maybe if more people were into slot car racing, we wouldn't have all this trouble with all those sheep going blind in Argentina or Panama... or Portugal or wherever it was that my Systems professor was talking about last week. Most people have no idea how big a theater is. Theaters are like icebergs. Or at least they're like what books say icebergs are like. [indistinct chatter] I've never actually seen an iceberg. Well, it's not like I haven't seen icebergs on the Discovery Channel. What I'm getting at is that you can only see a little bit of the iceberg, and the rest is submerged. Just like you can only see a little bit of the theater, the house and the stage. I don't mean that it's cold or anything. The catwalks are way too hot for the theater to be cold like an iceberg. Except maybe when Gene turns up the A/C in the summer. He always uses way too much A/C. You have to walk to the theater in your long pants and you fry the whole way. And the cats never cool off, because all the cold air drops out of the ducts and pools in the house. [woman] What a piece of work is a man. How noble in reason. How infinite in faculty. In form, in moving, how express and admirable. In action, how like an angel. In apprehension, how like a god. The beauty of the world. The paragon of animals. The paragon of the world. [indistinct chatter] But while you sit down there, watching your interpretive dance of the destruction of the Inca Empire by the Dance Exchange, or your lecture by a noted author and handgun enthusiast, who was part of our "Masters of Deceit" speaker series. [man] You can't say Dallas doesn't love you, Mr. President. What you don't see is the big empty place full of steel girders hanging over your head in the dark. You only see the stage. And only the stuff happening on the part of the stage that happens to be lit. Everything else is in the dark. You can see the exit signs. But there's all sorts of stuff up there just... hanging. [indistinct chatter] Clusters of speakers, cloud cluster, voice of God, and the new JBLs we got last week. It's all hanging from this orange nylon daisy chain stuff they say is strong enough to hold up a whole airliner, which is pretty cool. All these different lights, you know: 6x9, 6x12, 6x16, Fresnel, baby Fresnels, Canons, Par Cans, scoops, works, Xenon arc spots... There are all these rooms up there: Sound room, CD deck, reel-to-reel, Nakamichi 4-head, MidiVerb, 24-channel mixing board, Clear-Com base... Digital EQ, mics, 57s, 58s, PZMs, PCCS. Which sounds like a weapon from Cluster Invective, but it's just a mic. Shotgun, amp rack, Crown and QSCs, patch board, the old VOT, gel library of nine zillion different colors, Roscolux and GamColor, and those little metal things you put in the 6x9s to make patterns. I don't remember what those are called. I'll ask Samantha later. The light room, the two light computer things, uh, the house panic control box, scoops and work box, the tech director's booth, projection room, follow spot room, the office, the tech lounge, the design room, wait bay, catwalks, fly rail, pin rail. All of that is hanging over your head, every time you step into the theater. You just can't see it. It's in the dark, just over your head. And in order for that one-man show about St. Sebastian to come off, all sorts of action has to happen. Out of sight, like an iceberg, but upside-down. I can't believe they shot that guy full of arrows, right there on stage. He got the audience to do it. He handed out bows and arrows to the first three rows. All these profs in suits and ties, winging arrows at this actor-guy at center stage. Man, think I'll stick to technical theater. Anyway, when you go into a theater to see a show, you have no idea what you're getting yourself into. [female announcer] Good afternoon, ladies, and welcome to the Third Annual Pan- Hellenic Fashion Show, "Hamlet: Fashion of Thought, Fashion of Action." -I don't feel so hot. -[boy] Hi, Jay! I haven't felt right all day. I think it's because I don't eat enough fresh foods. I mostly eat complex carbohydrates, pastas and breads. That stuff keeps good in the dorm. I mean, I'm kinda up and down: energy, no energy. Back and forth. [buzzing] I think my immune system hates me. -[boy] Yeah! -It's because I live like a rat. Okay, be right there. Well, that's what my dad thinks. Come on, guys, we gotta go back to work... I'd feel better if I had a Coke. A Coke would get my metabolic rate up and help my body defeat this bug I think I've got. I heard that on the radio. It would elevate my heart rate and that would mean I'd be getting more oxygen to my issues. And I read most bacteria that make you sick are anaerobic. So if I had more oxygen in my tissues, I wouldn't be sick. Maybe that's why Americans are so healthy. We drink more Coke than any other nation on Earth. [seagulls calling] We have more energy. I think that's why we're so keen on building stuff and going places. We've got a lot of oxygen and we're tall. Of course, if it really is a virus, the oxygen won't do me any good because viruses aren't really alive. I'm working this call signed up on follow spot. Of course, the show doesn't need any follow spot, so I'm just dead weight on this call. [keyboard clacking] John is on the computer playing Cluster Invective, which is definitely the tech crew's favorite game. Gene, our tech director, he got the computer to keep records and stuff. Cluster's this sort of virtual reality deal where you're a pilot of this giant war robot and you have to crush all resistance on this technologically backwards planet. The graphics for the burning village part of the game are really awesome. It's got these cows running around everywhere. [keyboard clacking] [indistinct video game chatter] Hey, John. How's it going? [John] Well, pretty good. Except the fucking Xenos have me pinned down on top of Hill 169-er. I tried calling in for air support from the HK wing at fire base Ant Hill, but the tac daemon keeps sending me the request denied protocol. Shit. Oh, hey! Did you route that request through standard mil-ops narivan or did you use the drop switch repeater on the satellite uplink on Valkyrie-Net? Uh, no, I used mil-ops. Oh, well see, half the time, the sorters on mil-ops are working on tactical data that's like over a week old, so they don't think there's any reason to send in air support. Um, that's why I use Valkyrie-Net, I mean, just go ahead, control-alt-shift-F7. That'll, uh, scramble in the HKs in about five minutes. Okay... [indistinct video game chatter] Wow! Thanks a lot, Jay! Hey, you still need help on that calculus homework? Oh, yeah! Nah, we got a test in there next week and I'm really lost. Like, F of N over X or something like that. Okay, then. All right. [Jay] Everybody that works in the theater's a student, except for Gene, so we all have a lot of the same likes and dislikes. That, and we all have names that start with "J," which I guess is sort of strange. Though I never really thought about it until now. When I step inside the tech booth, Jamey, Jim and Jamin are all looking down at the audience with binoculars. It's a sorority fashion show, so everybody down there is female. Which is probably why the guys are fighting over the binoculars. -[boy 1] Lemme see! -[boy 2] Come on, man! [chuckling] Ooh! Ooh, five more in the back! Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, and most excellent fancy. Here hung those lips that I have kissed, I know not how oft. [Jay] It's the talent segment of the show. And these girls are on stage acting out that Shakespeare play. The one about the prince. There's a fancy sword fight and then the prince kills the king and everybody's dead, except for the prince and his pal or-- or her pal, since it's all girls. I seem to remember reading about how all the actors in Shakespeare's time were women. I guess to draw a big crowd. Like those places over by the air base. So that makes this pretty authentic, I guess. [♪] ♪ To be, or not to be [female announcer] Funerals may be solemn, but they don't have to be dull. Whether you're shuffling off this mortal coil, or just visiting a friend, you'll look simply... smashing in any one of these retro-restoration ensembles. [♪] [applause] [boy] Lovely legs. -Hi, Jay! -Hey, Jasper. [Jay] All J's except for Samantha, who's the only girl who works at the theater. So I suppose she doesn't count. But even if she did, it's still pretty amazing. [footsteps] [girl] What a piece of work is a man. How noble in reason. How infinite in faculty. In form and moving, how express and admirable. In action, how like an angel. In apprehension, how like a god. The beauty of the world. The paragon of animals. And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights, not me. No, nor woman neither. Though by your smiling, you seem to say so. [Jay] I walk out onto the cat. The guys'll clock me out when the show's over. That way, I get full pay. I'm heading down the ladder. I'm about halfway down when I step on something that isn't supposed to be there. [girl] Ow-- Jay! You're supposed to look down when you go down a ladder, okay? And I realize it's Sam. [Jay] I didn't mean to step on your hand again. I mean, Samantha. Everybody here calls her Sam because Samantha is a bit of a mouthful. [Sam] Well, you slept up in the wait bay... [narrating] Not like there's a little replica of her in my mouth or anything. [Jay] Yeah, but it's warm up there and I just imagine... You know what I mean. [Jay] ...a zero-G environment. Everybody here has asked her out at least once. except for me, 'cause I figure why bother. She's about a foot shorter than I am, but she could break my leg if she wanted to. She plays field hockey. Still, she's pretty nice to me. And she never tries to get me to fall for some of the stuff, like the other guys at the theater. Like the time they sealed me in the orchestra pit. [metal clanging] It's close. I can smell her perfume and the detergent she uses to wash her clothes. Surf with Snuggle fabric softener. And Woolite on the sweater. This is bad, 'cause we're about 15 feet off the deck. [Jay] Is Rachel going? [Sam] Yeah, I think she's trying to get Walt to go. Oh... How long has she been up? Hm, like um... 159 hours. People that can do math like that in their head are amazing! -Has she done anything weird? -Yeah, actually she has. Rachel is a Psych major on a full scholarship. And now she's doing this sleep deprivation experiment. She's trying to stay awake as long as she can and take notes on how it drives her nuts. [recording] Rachel Porter, voice log, hour 20. Doesn't feel like me... [Jay] She's got this one bullfighter outfit that's killer. [Rachel] ...nervous, apprehensive. -[Jay] Rachel is Sam's roommate. -[Rachel] Upset stomach... [Jay] They both live in my dorm, which is co-ed. Mom wasn't sure about me living in a co-ed dorm, but I don't think she's got anything to worry about because it sure hasn't done me any good so far. Rachel is real good-looking, too. She's got this short, dark hair and wears a lot of black turtlenecks. [Rachel] ...room getting brighter, crazy dreams, loss of subject-object... [Jay] I don't think I'd be a real good Psych major. I try to get at least 12 a night. -[Rachel] ...everything's separated... And, like, she circled all the pawn shops and all the sporting goods stores with a magic marker. So are you gonna come or what? [Jay] I might go if Walt goes. [Sam] I don't know if he's gonna come. It's like he won't give me a straight answer or anything, it's like, "Yes, I will" or "No, I won't." But he's not doing either. I don't know, he's just been really fucked-up lately. [man] Because your hair was a matter of national security. [Jay] I'm gonna go to the snack bar now. Are you coming back? I need a Coke. [Jay] No, I'm going over to the tower. [Sam] Jay! I just got a weird, bad feeling. Be careful, okay? Okay. [metal scraping] [announcer] In this hot little number, Laertes is no Danish butter cookie. But with thigh-high boots of hand-tooled chambray leather, she still shows that distinctive look of Denmark. Ladies and gentlemen, the Danish invasion is here. [♪] [male announcer] Laertes, son of Polonius. [applause] [announcer continues indistinctly] Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. At this particularly delicate moment, Horatio is sporting a subtle silk jacket which plays a perfect foil to the prince's uptown leather ensemble, with a cool look that says, "Don't steal my throne." These girls are dressed for action, whether it's in the throne room, the board room, or the bedroom. The rest, as they say, is silence. [applause] [Jay] The theater is part of the student center, which is a really big building. It has the student radio station, the student television station, the student newspaper, the student government, a cafeteria and a 7-11 sorta snack shop deal. Except that the prices are a lot worse than 7-11. [weatherman] Look, Tammy, Frank, I've about had it with the "What's the weather looking like at the beach this weekend" thing. You all need to remember the complex nature of the weather... [continues indistinctly] [Jay] My parents put all my money on my debit card, that way, I can't buy any beer with it. I wouldn't drink even if I had the money. All that ever happens is I fall asleep. But my mom doesn't trust me any further than she can throw me, which is actually probably pretty far. What I figure is that I'll stop by the shop and pick up that Coke I wanted. Max! Hello there, Jay! What brings you to the snack bar? [Jay] So I round the corner and there's Dr. Boaz, my Systems Thinking professor. I have to take this Systems Thinking class because I'm undesignated, which doesn't mean that people don't know what I am, it's just that I don't know what I'm gonna major in. Maybe Philosophy. Well anyway, Dr. Boaz wants us all to call him Max 'cause that's his first name and... he's one of those professors. He's a tall guy, like 6 1/2 feet tall and moves like one of those thin man hunter-killers from Cluster Invective. Like a morph between that and a-- a Vulcan. He wears those photo-sensitive eye glasses. The kind that never actually get all the way untinted. Dr. Boaz is really cool. I'm sure he smoked pot back in the '60s. He told our class about all these sensory-deprivation experiments he and his pals did in graduate school. They had this big tank. He said it looked like one of those hot water heaters with one of those submarine hatches on top, the kind with the wheel you turn. And the tank was filled with this saline solution that they kept heated at a steady 98.7. You breathed off this scuba helmet and they kept the inside of the tank totally dark. After a copy of hours, people would start talking to their dead grandparents and say all this stuff about Mark Twain being nailed up on the cross. And you could hear it all over this mic feed they had in the helmet. Well, one day, this guy crawls into the tank, and he just doesn't come out. They just couldn't find him. He vanished. So the university gets all pissed off and they have to stop the project with the tank. Weird, huh? Dr. Boaz said they made that movie, Altered States, based on the stuff they did with the tank. Jack, this Computer Science guy in my suite, and all his hacker pals drop acid and watch that movie over and over. They tried to make one of those tanks in our shower with duct tape and trash bags, but it busted and flooded out the study lounge next door. Boy, did they catch hell for that. They all have Boaz for their A.I. classes. -[siren blaring] -[man] All right, everybody, show's over! Show is over! [Jay] Uh, you know... nothing much, I was just gonna buy something. Something in particular? Or just a personal need to move capital? Trickle-down micro-economics? Or a bold move to seize a market singularity? [chuckles] Nothing that fancy, Dr. Boaz. Oh-- Max! I was-- I was just gonna get a Coke. But sometimes I do come down here, you know, just wanting to buy something. Yes. We can't help ourselves. Money is movement. Emerging out of system complexity. It's fluid dynamics and turbulent flow. Our wallets have a predisposition toward meaningful action. An auto-poetic impulse. Wow! Wow, that makes me feel better. [Max] Is that Coke in the bottle or from the fountain? Oh, in the bottle. In a plastic bottle? I find the drink has a better taste in the plastic bottle. Oh. Wow, you, too? I-- I like it a lot better in the plastic bottle than in the can or from the fountain. I'm almost certain it has something to do with long-chain polymer off-gassing. Wow. Polymers. Yeah. -[Velcro ripping] -Oh, look, Jay. Compared to you, I'm loaded. I'm a professor. Let me spring for the Coke. Oh, thanks, Max! [coins clatter] [Jay] So he gets two 20 oz. cokes in the injection-molded PVC bottles and we walk outside. Jay. Where you headed? Oh. Over there. Good, I'm going your way. Let's walk. [Jay] I wanna open my Coke, but I notice that he's just holding his with the cap still on. I figure it would be impolite or something to open mine, so... I just hold mine, too. [birds chirping] So Boaz and I are just strolling along, holding our Cokes, and it's about 3:30 in the afternoon. People are rolling past on their mountain bikes. It's real comfortable out, so most of the girls are wearing shorts, so I'm trying really hard to pay attention to Boaz. As he was nice enough to buy me the Coke and everything. [drumming] [Max] Well, Jay, I'm going over to the computing center to bag some main frame time for this little virtual reality number I'm working on. [Jay] Virtual reality? What kinda VR deal is it? [Max] Cluster Invective 2: The Tiger Mound Incident. [Jay] Wow! Cluster Invective? You programmed that? I mean-- That's my favorite game. It's super-real! You coded that? I mean, the cows! [Max] Sure did, Jay. And I must say, this one's got a gem of a random violence algorithm. Line-of-sight microwave link. I'm adding those to Cluster 2. [Jay] Cool. Aren't those for secure point-to-point ground communication? [Max] Yes, and fully encrypted, as a matter of fact. [Jay] Wow. If those are up, I bet that's a complete battlefield edge. [Max] Can't buck C-3, my young friend. That's the lesson to be learned there. Where you headed, young Jay? Why our parallel paths? Why the intersecting sets? [Jay] Actually, Dr. Boaz, this is where I get off. The two of us are standing in the middle of the big brick plaza that's in the center of campus that everybody calls "The Plaza." I'm pointing across the way to my dorm, Foucault Tower. It's just about the biggest thing on campus. It's part of the library, a couple of student computer labs, and a big dorm. It's my second year there. Dr. Boaz is standing on the bricks, holding his Coke in his left hand and looking like he's gonna twist off the cap any second with his right. He's just standing there, looking up at Foucault, which is pronounced "Foo-COH," not "Foo-CALT." Which is what I called it for nearly a year before my roommate, Walt, finally taught me the right way. Foucault Tower. He says it the right way. I remember when they built this thing almost 20 years ago. The wife and I had a picnic lunch out here in the plaza every day for a week, 'cause that's how long it took 'em to put it together. Incredible feat of architectural engineering, isn't it? Twenty-eight stories tall. Houses 1.5 thousand students. Yep, they built the whole thing in sections. One story units at this factory in the Canadian Mid-West. Pittsburgh steel, North Carolina brick, Texas HVAC system, Massachusetts glass. Imagine it, resting out there on that permafrost. Leviathan in sections. Think of it, Jay. See it in your mind. They don't build a train big enough to haul these things. These 28 discreet quanta, soon to become one. So what's to do? Air National Guard Sikorsky skyhooks, that's what. Massive dual counter-rotational rotor choppers, four to a story. 112 of the biggest damn helicopters you'll ever see in your life. Foucault Tower just swept down here like some storm front. The kind that makes meteorologists weep. An architectural Alberta clipper. They just stacked them up, Jay. Like the biggest damn Lego blocks you've ever seen in your life. -Like God's own Lego blocks! -[gunshot echoes] [gunshot] -[gunshot] -[screaming] -[gunshot] -[grunting] -[gunshot] -[grunting] [gunshots continue] [girl] Oh, my God! [gunshot] [gunshot] [siren blares in distance] [boy] Jay! God? [boy] No! It's Walt! Walt? [Walt] Yeah, come on up! Wait, you can't go out there! There's this guy-- [TV playing in background] [gunshot] [girl] Hi, Jay! [Jay] Oh, hey Sally. How's it going? Oh, I'm doing all right. There's somebody shooting out there. Yeah. I know. So then I see Sally Richardson, this really cute girl that sits in front of me in my Systems class, which I guess we won't be having anymore. Sally's a redhead with real pretty blue eyes. She's got a nice voice, too. She sings in the choir. She's the third girl in from the right, on the second row up from the bottom when they get everybody on the risers. Sometimes I work the call and she talks to me on her way out. She's real nice. She always waves "hi" to me. That could mean she likes me. Or it could mean she's just acting nice. Typically, Walt's the guy I'd straighten this stuff out with, and I'm distracted 'cause I'm trying to run two Walt simulations in my head. One is to get some advice on what to say to Sally, and the other is to try and figure out why Walt's up on the roof. It's probably that there's some hurt people up there, some people in danger there, and he's trying to help them because he's this Eagle Scout and everything. But he's been so spacey lately, that I'm worried he's gonna ignore his own safety or something. So I need to get up there and help him get inside. It figures this is when I get some prime Sally time. Jeez, you don't look so hot. You've got Coke all over you. I kinda got this... virus. Oh, I'm sorry. You gonna be okay? Yeah. Hey, I'd love to take cover with you, but I have to go up to the roof and get my roommate off it before he gets hurt. Oh, jeez, I don't know. Be careful. Well, I'll see you in Systems on Friday. Yeah. [gunshot] [distant sirens] [banging on door] [Jay] Hey! I can't open the door! [banging continues] It's-- They did something to the door! [banging continues] I-- [banging continues] You'd better just wait! They-- [banging continues] I have to-- I have to go. I step in and hit the button for the top. The elevator always lurches and I feel like I'm getting -bad goggle track in Cluster. -[elevator dings] But then it's really slow. My pal, Phil, in Architecture, says it's 'cause we bought the equipment from the Russians as some sort of peace gesture. I look down in the corner of the elevator and see Rachel Porter, Sam's roommate, kinda stuck in the corner of the floor. She's wearing the bullfighter outfit. I don't know what to do. I don't wanna touch her the wrong way and make her think I'm trying to put the moves on her. I listen real close to check that she's still breathing, because she isn't moving a whole bunch. Hey. Hey, Rachel. It's me, Jay. Burn cycle. Waking state. I guess the experiment sorta caught up with her. Emergent properties. Acute paranoia. [Jay] Hey! You can't sleep in the elevator. You gotta go back to your room, okay? All right? Hyp-- Hypnotic vision. She smells like clove cigarettes, which always makes me imagine I'm in a Russian movie. Which is strange because I've never seen a Russian movie. But Rachel looks like she'd be good in one of those. She'd need a bigger jacket, though, because it's cold there. Doesn't it sound like something in a Russian movie? A girl falling asleep in an elevator? I really wish I knew what to say. I feel like I'm really blowing it here. [lighter flicking] She's drooling. Still cute, though. She won't get up. I pull the stop plunger and grab under her. -[bell ringing] -The bell starts ringing in the elevator. It's about 50 feet to her suite. [bell ringing] Fuck. I see Bobby. Bob's this Econ guy. He's always wearing a tie. [Rachel] Localized psychosis. [Bob] Jay-man! What's wrong with Rachel? [Jay] Oh, I don't know. Some psych major thing. I'm taking her back to her suite right now. I'm hoping Walt's smart enough to keep his head down, 'cause this won't take long. Collective memory loss. [Bob] Oh, man! She's kinda heavy. Oh, man, that reminds me. You know Jimmy, right? Well, it doesn't matter. Anyway... his dad works at Butterball Turkey. [continues indistinctly] [bell ringing] [distant sirens] [distant screaming] [Bob] Up you go. [Bob] Hey, man! Heard on the radio there's some guy shooting people out on the plaza. [Jay] Oh, yeah. I was just down there. [Bob] Jay-man! You all right? [Jay] No! I just got this virus, you know? [Bob] Yeah. Oh. [Jay] All right. -[thud] -[distant screaming] We put Rachel inside the door and stick a Post-It note on her, telling her suite-mates to put her to bed. I jog back to the elevator and hop back in. Bob's still talking about the radio. Then he starts to tell me that I should stay here with the shooting and everything. I push the stop plunger and the car starts moving again. [bell stops ringing] [dinging] [cart clattering] [humming] [loud metallic clanging] You can't get off on the 19th floor. They sealed it off about seven years ago and nobody knows why. Gene down at the theater says that the campus cops have got some kind of computer in there, -and they use it to keep track of everybody. -[electronic buzzing] He says that they even keep track of what you get at the snack bar and the cafeteria because about seven years ago is when they started using magnetic IDs. He says they dump all that stuff into the main NSC database in D.C. Gene says that they can tell from what you eat what sort of political stuff you think. Keeps talking about how they're gonna arrest all the vegetarians. So I'm always sure to eat at least a cheeseburger a week. Gene's a smart guy. He keeps track of everything he reads on these note cards, which I figure is a good idea. If I did that, I bet I'd get better grades. Jamin swears that he saw a miniature helicopter fly outta one of the windows once. But that's gotta be bullshit because the guys at the theater are always trying to get me to fall for that stuff. And he doesn't even live here. He lives over in Crowley. And how would they get the gas for the helicopter up there, anyway? -All I know is that when you pick up the phones in here... -[phone ringing] ...sometimes you can hear what's going on in other folks' rooms, just like it was the radio or something. Once I picked up the room and heard this guy reading poetry. Something about tornadoes and measuring oceans. Walt once picked it up and heard this couple screwing. Figures I get the poetry. I gotta remember to get some of those 3x5 cards. I write it on my hand with the felt tip I keep in my pocket. I finally get to the study lounge on the top floor. Most people don't use it anymore, but it does have a really good view of the experimental roof garden on the top of the old botany building. They planted this balanced ecosystem up there, and you could go walk through it with your date because it was really beautiful. But then they had to close it down because they found out the building had all this asbestos and fibers in it. And then they ran out of money to clean it up, but they did get money to build the new botany building, so the old one's just sorta gone wild. There was this kinda suicide fad in the study lounge my freshman year. There were a bunch of different people doing it. The entire Philosophy and Self-Knowledge Club just up and jumped off the balcony. They just put down their books and pens... Walked out to the observation deck and jumped off. I guess they must've figured something out. That's the main thing keeping me from going into Philosophy right now. People would want me to go to the club meetings, and I'm not sure I wanna do that. Then again, Rachel's in Philosophy and Self-Knowledge. [distant sirens blaring] Walt! -[Walt] Jay! That you? -Yeah! [Walt] Hey, uh... you didn't bring anybody with you, did ya? No! Should I have? [Walt] No! No, don't worry about it! Just come on up! Okay. Give me a second. [man on bullhorn] Walt! Walt! This is Dr. Haroldson. You came by my office and we talked about your problem. Everyone disappearing, right? I'm here to let you know that's not the way, all right? There are better ways to go about this. [phone ringing] [Haroldson] ...telling me that you're an Eagle Scout. I'm very impressed with that. Anyone would be very impressed with that. Your name, now. Let that reverberate around inside of that big, bright skull of yours. Walt Whitman. -Hello! -[man] I'm on top of [indistinct] Gimme a look up there. -Gimme a look. -Okay. -That's good. -Yeah. -Get on it. -All right. Hey, that's good. Hey, stand still just like I'm gonna take your picture, okay? -Okay? -[gunshot] -[Haroldson] You're an A student. -[Jay] Yes. [gunshots ricochet] [Walt] To the wall! You gotta keep your fucking head down. [Jay] Walt always was fast. He's killer at ultimate Frisbee. He's one of those guys that can do everything. Write A papers, play chess, talk to girls and get 'em to laugh at his jokes. Repair cars, shoot foul shots, fix radios, score free steaks from the dining hall by doing this trick with his meal card. He's the only guy on the floor that can get the radiators to work when it's cold. He can talk his professors into giving extensions, flip a stack of ten quarters off his elbow and catch them all with the same hand before they hit the floor, and he knows what ties go with which shirts. Apparently, he's pretty good at helping people dodge bullets, too. He's a great guy. He loaned me five bucks to do my laundry -and never asked for it back. -[Walt] Come on, come on! I need to remember to pay him back. Wow! Walt, you saved my life! That nut almost got me. Well, Jay. That's actually the police trying to get me out from under cover. And it's pretty creative work, actually. I'm impressed. Walt, why are you wearing all this Army stuff? The cops are gonna think you're the guy if you're dressed like that. Well, police must've thought that you were me, and... it's pretty shoddy work when you think about it, I mean, it's not like they didn't have all afternoon to pre-calibrate. Do you want this, man? Yeah, thanks. Stupid campus cops. Yeah, come on. Set up over here. So Walt's got this campsite deal set up by the microwave. There's a blanket, a little radio, Walt's camping stove, a sleeping bag, four cans of Lone Star Beef Stew, a box of health food wheat crackers, three Zeppelin-brand snack cakes, five German chocolate bars from Europe, a pack of mint Zephyr chewing gum, a pair of binoculars, an umbrella, couple of smoke bombs from the Army-Navy, a big roll of firecrackers, and this rifle with these yellow see-through boxes full of bullets. Holy shit! I've never seen hardly any of this stuff in my life. He must've kept it all in that Boy Scout foot locker he brought back from home a couple weeks ago. Holy shit! Jay. Before you start and go and get the wrong idea, you know, let me explain myself. Jesus. Walt... You shot my fucking Systems professor! Sally was in there-- What do you mean, "Don't get the wrong idea"? -Fuck! -Jay! Okay. I'll listen. I figure, if he's talking to me, at least he won't be shooting anybody. Now, uh... you're not just saying that because you don't want me shooting anybody? No, no! No. I mean... Walt... you're my roommate. My-- My pal. You're the best buddy a guy could have. I mean, hell, you loaned me five bucks and you never even asked for it back. I'm-- I'm worried about you. You know, I had completely forgotten about that five bucks. Don't sweat it. Um... Why do you have "3X5" written on your hand? You know, to get some of those note cards, you know? I thought it would help me get organized. Notes and stuff. Yeah, I use those for all my reports. You know, I was using so many of them, my, uh-- my granddad got me a case of them down at the wholesale club and they're under my bed. So next time you're down at the room, you know, just get yourself a stack. [Haroldson continues indistinctly on bullhorn] [gunshot] [Haroldson] P erhaps in a great moment of weakness... [gunshot] Whoa! Okay, Walt, you almost got me. That was a good shot. -[gunshot] -[bullhorn squeals] [Haroldson groans] Jeez. Walt, those are real people down there! Jay... you know, it's like... Granddad says, "A Whitman has got to do... what a Whitman... has got to do." All right? I'm gonna be right back. Walt's last name is Whitman. Yeah, like the guy with the beard. We had to watch this movie in freshman Composition about how he would ride around on trollies and try to pick up soldiers and stuff. [gunshot] [sirens blaring] Which, well... I don't know what I think about that. [gunshot] [distant gunshot] -[gunshot] -[shell casing clatters] -[gunshots] -[grunting] -[gunshot] -[grunting] [gunshot] Jeez, you know, I've got one word for those guys, and that's "windage." Adjusted. [muttering] Hey, you want something? I got uh-- I got uh, mints, I got those, uh-- I got those Zeppelins here, I got, uh... I got some more gum, I got gum down over there, huh? How about uh... you want uh... some cupcakes, right? You want a cupcake. Okay, I got it. Got some cupcakes for you. Here you go. [indistinct dialog] -[snaps fingers] -Hey, how about some radio? [♪ jazz music] Cupcake, cupcake. Right, right? I'm trying to eat all the things. Cupcake? There you go. Walt, you don't smoke. -[Walt] The way-- -[coughs] The way I see it... don't look a gift horse in the mouth. These were free. I found them in the elevator. You don't want one, do you? -[radio announcer] WLAW. -No thanks. West Campus' only AM oldies station. [Jay] I can't believe you shot those people. They were all in the fade anyway, brother. Like bad 16mm movies from the '70s. You know, rented video on the dash in July. [Jay] What? Jay, do you remember Susan? Who? Do you remember when I asked you this question three days ago? What are you talking about, Walt? We got, uh... We got Lone Star Beef Stew. You want some? No. I'm still working on my cupcake. [thunder rumbling] Jay, I know you're gonna have a hard time believing this, I mean, especially given the circumstances and all, but I'm talking straight to you. I'm speaking the truth. I mean... the important thing is, have I ever lied to you? No, but you've never taken an elevator to the top of the roof and started shooting people, either. I'm sorry. That was kind of a cheap shot, huh? I-- Uh... It's okay. It's okay, don't worry about it. It's like this. I met... Suze at West High. We were both in band together, and uh... she played bass clarinet, and I was just learning to play bassoon. And, uh, she-- she was just about the cutest thing you ever saw, I mean, had this really nice red hair, you know? Wore it real long, down her back, uh... it was an auburn, it wasn't that kinda cheap-looking brassy-red. And uh... she had it in a bob, though, through most of college, which, I guess, is when you would've known her. Do you wanna see a picture? [Jay] Sure, sure. Walt, I can't tell who this is. What's wrong with this picture? You... took that picture. That happened to everything, you know? All her photos. I used to keep all her, uh... love letters to me in a-- in a big, old ammo box. And uh, uh... left it open one day-- One day! Rain came in through the window. She wrote them all in that damn pink felt pen of hers and... they're all blurry now, you know, like she... cried on them for eight hours straight. I dated this girl for three years in high school, you know? She was the first girl I ever kissed, the first-- first girl I ever said I love you to, other than my mom. Favorite drink was Diet Coke. Anyway, she, uh-- she gets this big present, from her grandparents, right? This trip to New York. And, uh... she's real excited about it 'cause, uh, you know, she's an art student. She's gonna go see all the galleries and studios and stuff. And I was gonna go, too, but, you know, my dad, he's kind of a tightwad, and I-- I couldn't get the money together, myself. So I'm driving her out to the airport, and she turns to me like she's real frightened and everything. And she goes, "Oh, Gosh! I left that overdue book down in your room. Can you take it to the library for me?" And I'm like, "Sure, I'll take it." And goes-- You know, she always gets so preoccupied about that stuff and I didn't want her worrying about it while she was in New York, and so... I drop her off at the terminal, and I wave goodbye to her and a kiss goodbye and, uh... I take her book back to the library, right? And I'm about to toss it in the return bin with all the other books, and I think it might be a good idea to, like, look through it, you know, see if she left any note cards in there or anything. And, uh, she had stuck the printout slip from the overdue department, circulation department... in there with it. It's got her name on it. Wanna see it? See? It's the only thing left of her. Was only supposed to be gone one week. Fucking overdue slip. [man] And we know the speed and distance of the furthest galaxies, and the speed it's moving, the rate it's slowing down. You can back-track it, like a movie. Reverse the film. And everything that's going away... started somewhere. So you take the speed and brought it back through Einstein equations. You come back to a point, singularity we call it. And he saw a past tense cataclysm strike this Earth. Mountains moved, destruction sweeps across the Earth. And then the exact same phrase as Genesis 1:2. "The Earth became a waste and a desolation." What we see in Genesis 1:2 onward... [♪] ...20 billion years ago. 186,000 miles a second. [Jay] The radio's playing that old song, "Happy, Happy Birthday, Baby." The one where you figure the lady singing the song is probably about the worst girlfriend a guy could ever have. Susan, Jesus, how many girls do I know named Susan? Yell Susan into a crowded room and four people turn around. -[phone ringing] -I guess eight if you count their boyfriends. The pay phone that got knocked off the wall starts ringing again, and the hell if I'm gonna answer it this time. I guess the wires are still hooked up. [phone ringing] Something about a girl. A girl... I feel like I'm taking a multiple choice test, and I can't quite tell if the answer's true or false. Perfume. Is that it? Am I thinking about perfume? Am I remembering something? Susan... Fucking overdue slip. I called her parents. They didn't know what the hell I was talking about. Tried to hook up with her roommate. Figuring that, you know, she'd know something and... she didn't know who I wa-- I mean, she acted like she'd never seen me before in her life. Uh, I'm-- I'm sorry, man, I-- I know I'm twisting your ear pretty bad here. [Jay] No. It's cool. [Walt] Okay. Okay, yeah, 'cause I mean... I gotta pull in a tangent here for this to make any sense. See, 'cause I'm a Whitman, right? I mean, we've got a family history. I mean, we're real proud of it. We're riflemen. [Jay] What? [Walt] You know, rifleman, sniper, sharpshooter, marksman. You know, hitter, deadeye, crackerjack. I'm the latest in a long family line of snipers. My granddaddy, he's always talking about our-- our genealogy and all that stuff, and, uh... he says that my great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather, Augustus Whitman, well, he was such a crack shot, I mean, he was so legendary all over, that uh, he became-- his character became the basis for James Fenimore Cooper's Natty Bumppo. You know, in the Leatherstocking Tales, with The Deerslayer, and Last of the Mohicans. And, uh, my great, great, great, great grandfather... was always talking about him. He was a sniper with the Confederate Army. He bagged four majors-- uh, four colonels, three majors, like uh, five captains, like eight or nine lieutenants. But his best shot, the one my granddad was always talking about, was, you know, he's-- this guy's only like 17, right? And he's up in this big oak tree and it's overlooking the Shenandoah River down there. And there's this-- there's this Union Major General and he's moving at a dead gallop right across this big field, and boom! Drops him right out of the saddle, half a mile out. Half a mile out! And Granddad, Granddad fought in the Pacific. And he was always telling me about how, you know, he'd be zeroing in on-- on guys, Japanese sentries, you know, by the light of their cigarettes. And Dad, before he-- before he started to sell insurance, well... he was a sniper in Vietnam. Forty-seven confirmed kills, I mean, that doesn't even count the unconfirmed. They're really stingy about that. I mean, you gotta show proof. Proof! I grew up with a rifle in my hand, you know? But my dad, he wanted me to be different. I mean, that's why they named me Walt, right? They figured a guy named Walt Whitman, he's not gonna grow up to be a sniper. Now, I was gonna go to college, be a-- be a scholar. But I still wanna be part of the family heritage, right? [Jay] Sure. Yeah, I understand that, I mean, my-- my dad wanted me to be a TV repair man. Right! So, I became a history major and... my plan was, I was gonna write the book of our family, and I was gonna call it, The Delicate Art of the Rifle. And it-- it was gonna have everything. It was gonna have pictures, and-- and battle diagrams, and interviews, and it was gonna have all the journals that my granddad had kept from his granddad, and that guy's granddad. And you could go into any library in this country and you could take that book off the shelf and you could read about the Whitmans. It's not gonna happen now, though. [Jay] Why? 'Cause I'm on the fade, too. 'Cause what Susan had... it's catching, see? I call her parents the other day, and it's disconnected. I look 'em up in the phone book. Nothing, not a blank line, not like it's been blacked out. There's nothing there. Directory assistance. No listing! I call her grandparents. They say they're childless. Never had kids. I call her roommate. She's gone. I call her parents. They're gone! So I go over to Housing Residence Life. I mean, I've been over to Student Health and finally-- I mean, Public Safety. And I'm finally over there and I say, "Look. "I'm looking for a registered student of this University. Her name is Susan N. Dutchman." Couple of keystrokes later, lady comes back to me, and she says, "Oh, yeah, "we got her right here in the database. Susan N. Dutchman. She's over in Foucault Tower, room 1973B." Foucault Tower, right? Room 1973B, right? I mean, you know and I know, and everybody on this campus with a brain and ears knows, that nobody lives on the 19th floor, man! The only thing I had left was this, right? The only thing left for Whitman on the fade, huh? Had to make my mark, make it real big, 'cause I'm not gonna be erased. You know, it's a-- it's a virus, I mean, it's communicable. I mean, it's just like the flu. I mean, you know how shit gets around on a college campus. It's a flu with a metaphysical vector, and a nice, long latency period. Better, uh-- Better listen in on my... fifteen minutes of fame while the getting's good, right? [weatherman] A massive intrusion of arctic air. Expect fast-forming cloud cover, explosive thunder showers and a plunging barometer. F-4 reported in the Durham vicinity. Flash flood warning in effect. -Torrential rain. Gale force wind-- -[static] [male newscaster] This just in. We have a news bulletin about the shooting that happened at Foucault Tower. -And now we'll-- -[man on radio] Ladies and gentlemen, I'm hoping to clear up some of the questions you may have about the regrettable incidents of the afternoon. We here at the administration, when given a lemon, try and make lemonade, and believe that this entire unfortunate affair presents an educational opportunity for everyone involved. Students that are out there today on the University Plaza are learning valuable skills and earning valuable life experience... -Shit! -What's wrong? The radio. Listen to it! [man] Hoping to maximize on the opportunities present, the Criminal Science undergraduate Special Weapons and Tactics Club, will be managing the situation at "FOO-calt"-- "FOO-coh" Tower. What we're concerned with here at the university, is education and job placement. [yelling] ...valuable resume-building-- [radio transmission ends] They don't mean sh-- I was least hoping to get-- Highway Patrol tactical teams, right downtown! Ranger unit, 30 minutes from here by Blackhawk! [man on bullhorn] Now listen! Is there anybody else up there with Walt? Just come out now with your hands up -and you won't get hurt. -[sirens blaring] If you're up there with him, you're stuck up there with him. you need medical assistance, the ambulances are here. They're here to help you. Everybody else, form a line to the left. I repeat, form a line to the left. If you need medical assistance, come to the red ambulance on the south side of the building. [continues indistinctly] [gunshot] [gunshot] Holy shit! What a shot! Oh... Sorry. [gunshot echoes] Hey, hey, hey! Hey... Rough afternoon, right? Rough afternoon. Do you want a Coke, huh? Coke? Sure. Yeah, here you go. Huh? It's my second free Coke of the day. Yeah? Yeah, I-- I didn't get to drink the first one. Well, that's no good. [sirens blaring] Jeez! Armed-response tip number one, you know, when attempting stuff, turn off the goddamn siren! Uh... [snaps fingers] I gotta go, you know, I gotta go work the other side of this building. It's the old, uh, one-two punch. But I'm gonna be right back. Hey, direct pressure on this. Direct pressure, that's your first step, slick, huh? I'll be right back. [sirens blaring] [gunshot] [sirens continue] [gunshot] [sirens blaring] [sirens stop] [silence] Sam? You're really shiny. Like an astronaut. Sam... can you-- can you get me outta here? Beam me out or something? [rattling] [electronic buzzing] [sirens blaring] [gunshots echo] -[shell casing clatters] -[Walt grunting] -[gunshot echoes] -[Walt] Whoo! Fucker! Hey, hey, hey. Jay? Jay? Speak to me, buddy. Bud. Look-a-chockie, Look-a-chockie. Look, look. Wake up, wake up! You have to do one more thing for me. Hey. [snaps fingers] One more thing for me, huh? A little amateur photography. This is my dad's old camera. Vietnam. He and his buddy, a spotter. See, snipers work in pairs, right? Well, his spotter would use this camera to help him out with kill confirmation, right? They were-- There were doing all this shooting and pictures weren't coming out for shit with this ordinary camera they were using. So they hooked up with this techie, who was in-country out of Lawrence Livermore. And they traded him a V.C., uh-- handmade V.C. Tommy gun for this camera here. It uh-- It uses this film, it's holographic. Captures details, you know, totalities. So anyway, what a spotter does is he scans the jungle, or the desert or whatever, with a pair of real high-powered binoculars. He's gotta look for movement. He's gotta acquire the target. When he's got it, he goes to his sniper and he says, "Here's your elevation. Here's your windage." They take that shot, you know? That's when my dad's buddy, he got into doing before and after shots, you know, -for kill confirmation. -[man on bullhorn] Whitman... But then they moved up, way up in the highlands, right? Doing this crazy work with... [indistinct] And the pictures just went to shit. That's when they got this camera. [Walt] Jay! [man] You've got five minutes to surrender. [man continues indistinctly] [indistinct yelling] [man on radio] B-team. Take cover... [man on bullhorn] Put down your weapon and surrender peacefully. Put down your weapon and surrender peacefully. We have the tower surrounded. No recourse. No chance. [SWAT Captain] Go! Okay, let's go! Come on! [thunder rumbling] You know-- You know what my granny used to say that? About when... the sun is shining and it's raining like that? [man on radio] B-team, B-team, take cover. Close quarters protocol. Know what she'd say? She'd say the devil was beating his wife. [Walt] Whoo-oo! [yelling indistinctly] [man on bullhorn] Put down your weapons and surrender peacefully. [indistinct] [man] Surrender. Put down your weapons and surrender peacefully. Everything is under our influence. [gunshot echoes] Everything is under control. You are in a closed, regulated system. [inaudible] [man on bullhorn continues indistinctly] [man] There is no escape. No recourse. No chances. No solution. There is no... of knowing [continues indistinctly] [screaming] [man] You are not the only one. Surrender. Surrender. Surrender. -[gunshot] -Surrender. Surrender [indistinct yelling] -[man] Terrorist! -[gunshot] -[SWAT Captain] [indistinct] -[man] Yes, ma'am! Then get out there! [gunshot echoes] [man on radio] ...appears to have an accomplice... [whirring] [birds chirping] [gunshot echoes] [panting] [gunshot] [seagulls calling] [gunshot] -[gunshot] -[indistinct yelling] [gunshot] -[gunshot] -[screaming] [grunting] [indistinct radio chatter] [man on radio] Of the making of many books, there is no end. And much study is a wariness of the flesh. Vanity, vanity, all is vanity, sayeth the preacher. For God will bring every work into judgment, and every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. [metal scraping, clanging] [Jay] The cops were supposed to come and talk to me about everything that happened. But they never did get around to it, I guess. Walt's folks came and got all his stuff and... what was left over after the cops came and got the evidence part. They never did find Walt. Nobody even talks about it. I lost the newspaper clippings I made of it. Sally thought they were a stupid idea, anyway. [door closes] His parents came and got all his stuff. [metal clanging] [footsteps echoing] I'm working a lot more at the theater, lately. I'm supposed to go ballast the rigging up at the wait bay. [metal clanging] [door closes] I think I'm still sick. I don't have any energy. My Physics professor says that that's all we are, energy stored in the form of matter. The stage lights are heating the girls, and making their perfume float up. I hear this girl's voice. Some of the guys on the crew are afraid of heights. It's never bothered me, though. It must be because we're descended from apes. Sam's voice is real soft. It's just kinda floating down from up in the dark. It's real soft. And it's warm. It's as dark as it gets in the theater. We have to kill the work lights so the stage lights won't get screwed up. Because the girls need to rehearse for the show. But even the stage is off. And Sam just keeps talking... and talking. And just all these words and... words that I can't really hear. And I'm just climbing... and climbing. It's dark. And the words are coming down from her mouth. I'm listening... and climbing. And the higher I go... the heavier the perfume. And the darker the dark.
