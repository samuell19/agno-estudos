All right. Elena is ready. - Probably 15 seconds. - Copy, 15. One hundred. Hi! - Who is this? - Elena. I don't remember getting into it, but I know I was just the most competitive child in the world. I hated to lose when I was a kid. Eleven-years-old. Wow! Look out for her. She is the future of women's snowboarding, and that's Elena Hight. She was top dog at a very young age. The rest of us were like, "Whoa, man, you made finals. Nice work." Elena was, like, for sure in finals and probably on the podium. Just landing into the top of transition. Feel like, she came in with some aggressiveness. I was like, "Oh, that's why they call you Mighty Mouse." One, two... Oh! Never been done. Female or male... She was a dominant competitive figure for so many years. That is huge. Taking women's half-pipe snowboarding to the next level. It's hard to walk away from something that you know you're good at, that you haven't quite accomplished everything you wanted to accomplish. It's hard to know when that moment is that you're not going to regret pushing harder, but also feeling the pull of your heart is taking you in a different direction. You can see the blue skies. To me, it just seems like many of my friends, she's come to this point where the contests just really weren't doing it. It wasn't inspiring, you know, and this is like something she can really sink her teeth into again and do what she did in the contest world and go and do that in freeriding. It looks like I would need to kind of, like, redirect. This transition to the backcountry is scary. I'm not a seasoned veteran. And I'm learning along the process, and that is kind of scary. It doesn't look too crazy over here. All right. There's so much more involved than just the snowboard in backcountry riding. And when you go into the mountains, you're forced into a place of observation which takes presence and it's always changing. It's very nerve-racking walking away from what I've done for the past 15 years and going to this avenue that had a lot to learn and no real idea if I'm going to succeed or fail, but I feel like just the experience is worth taking the leap. All right. Elena dropping in ten. Five, four, three, two, one. You know, with as much travel as I have been doing in my career, waking up at home is just such a treat in itself. I haven't really spent an entire winter at home or even a month of a winter at home since I was, like, 15. So it's pretty cool to be off the contest scene and also have a winter like this lined up in Tahoe where I can stay home and explore. Yeah, it's pretty... Pretty special. I feel very fortunate to grow up here, and, you know, my parents worked really hard so that we could live in this beautiful place and be surrounded by nature and we would go riding at night, we'd go every weekend. My parents would drive me all around the lake for USASA events, and we'd all get together and run around the mountain together and cause trouble. You know, it's just a really tight-knit community here. Looks good. It's a double stager now. I think you should hit it. There's a lot of really amazing snowboarders here in Tahoe and a lot of people that I've looked up to for a long time and really wanted to get those people here and run around our backyard together. So, ride us right to the rock or ride us left to the rock. So we've got Nick Russell, Danny Davis, and a couple days out with Sammy Luebke. You know, when you're out deep in the mountains, the people that you're with are really so important. They are your safety net. They're your confidence boost. They're like the ones that are keeping the vibes high, passing along wisdom and I've been really, really fortunate to be out with a lot of really amazing people this year. Oh, yeah, this is the zone now. - Pretty cool. - Wow. Yeah. Variable day out here on our snowboards, riding with two of my longtime friends, Nick... Russell and Elena... Hight.

All of these zones are what I watched on repeat in the films, and it's pretty cool to be out in these legendary zones, and it makes you appreciate where snowboarding comes from and where it's going. Let's go, Sun. Come on, Sun. Let's do this. I'm ready. Jeremy Jones is the first person to ride Grizzly Spines and Paradox. You know, a line as serious as the Grizzly Spines, um, if something happens, you know, the consequences are high. I remember vividly riding a line, kind of came over the roll and there's really nothing there. It's like super airy below, it's so steep, you couldn't come to a stop if you wanted to. Pulled out by the skin of my teeth, and I'm not sure I could go back and repeat it. Paradox was one of my favorite movies as a kid. I think it was just... It came out at a time when I was really watching a lot of videos and it was really groundbreaking at the time. There was a lot of exposure, and Jeremy just went up there and slayed it. Standing on top of this line that I've been looking at in photos forever. It's down there. Been on top of this thing for about an hour, just waiting for the sun to pop. Just waiting. Patience is a virtue. Oh, man. Really hard call right now. Looks like there's more clouds rolling in. Let's, uh, call it. Looked epic to ride, and knowing that Jeremy was the first person to ride it and he's been such an inspiration to me and helping me, like, step into this new life really. Like, Jeremy's been such a big part of that for me. The generation before me really has made what seemed impossible really possible, which has been kind of the inspiration for me to continue on what I'm doing. Whoo! Go now. Whoo-hoo! The creek is giving us traction. Yep, we got this. We got it. And we're out. - Good job, Elena. - And we're out. Cruising, getting lost in nowhere Japan. Break nowhere apart is now here. So we're here right now. There's so many mountains, so many little mom and pop ski resorts. And it's just limited by your imagination. Walking around the forests of Japan. How's that there? Whoo! Yeah. Great. Putting together this trip, Hana was like a no-brainer for me. She really has brought me into the backcountry and shared her passion of it with me throughout the years and she just loves snowboarding more than anyone and that essence is really... It's contagious. I just think this is such a beautiful opportunity for her to go and experience all the different kinds of snowboarding. And it's really cool to be, like, passing along some of the knowledge I've picked up to her. Right here and then I thought... And seeing her determination and energy is fulfilling me in a different way. - Yeah! - Hana! Fun, huh? See there's a couple... in there. Ended up talking to Travis and he was like, "I'm going to be in Japan." I'm like, "I want to snowboard with you girls." - No, it's right here. - So close there. I was over here with one of my dearest Japanese riding partner Shin Biyajima. We were gonna be just travelling, exploring some new areas. Worked out too perfect not to jump on it. I've always looked up to him and the things that he does on a snowboard and he has elevated snowboarding in a lot of ways. There's always stuff out in the backside. It doesn't feel like there's a ceiling in freeriding. You're limited by your own creativity. - Coming! - Yep. There are endless set-ups in the mountains with snow conditions, terrain features. It's endless. Whoo! To be in the backcountry and see the way, like, Hana looks at features differently than Travis looks at features, it's just super inspiring and exciting because you really can ride things however you want to. - We're pretty legit off the backside. - It's pretty big. Feel better about it, now that I see the landing. - Right? - Yeah. Backcountry riding, free riding, you know, it comes from an internal compass of, "Where do I wanna take this? How do I wanna approach it? Where do I wanna go with it?" It's fascinating. I've loved all components of it. There's no straightforward way to learn it except by going out and doing it and it's really great to see Elena's authentic interest in exploring it. Have fun. - Will do. - Just ridin', pal... You'd enter at the top big open and then you'd have to wriggle through to get around that. First ridge past the chunky... ♪ Now listen ♪ Oh, yeah Pretty freaking money. Four, three, two, one. Drop.

Oh, my God. That looks so sick, dude. Snowboarding as an industry really grew up in Tahoe. It was an epicenter of filming and contests and people just thriving on the sport. And it's been so cool to go back to these spots that I watched as a kid, being like, "Wow, I remember this. "And this inspired me so much as a kid," to attempting to do the same thing that they were doing. Its mind-bending, actually. Come on. Whoo!

Play it by ear when I get up there. That knife edge, it will be your point of reference the entire time. Just gravitate your front foot towards... Copy. Okay. Oh, universe... Strong. I can. No, I can. Oh, my God. That was perfect! All right! Holy Whoo! It was fun. Thanks, Tim. When I heard that Elena pulled it, I mean, I just was blown away. I don't know. It's just a huge accomplishment. And the fact that she is a female just makes it that much cooler and clear that when Elena sets her mind on something, as she's done with freeriding, she is a freak. And there's very few people at that level of riding. That was so fun. I've never been up this way. Wow. Dropping. We are in Pemberton, British Columbia. I'm really excited to be posted up out here with Jake Blauvelt. We were kind of intertwined in circles of my competitive career and, you know, as I grew up and he kind of stepped away from competitions and into backcountry snowboarding. I followed his career and was always so impressed. And you could just really see his creativity shining through. Those human-eating holes. - What a beauty. - Mmm-hmm. Wow. Wow. I think this has completely changed my perspective on snowboarding and what is possible and where I want to take my snowboarding in the future. It's exciting to kind of hone in on an idea and kind of see a door open and just really step into the mountains and some silence and get back to the roots of snowboarding. Whoo! - That was huge. - That was so good. All right, man. Let's get down there. - Hey. - Yeah. Yeah! - Wow. - Whoo-hoo! Hell, yeah. I think the really cool thing about Jake and what I've loved about being in the mountains with him is just his eye for being able to draw lines down mountains really creatively is unlike anyone I've ridden with. So to see that and learn from that first-hand is, like, really special. Okay. Dropping. Whoo! Holy fuck. Yeah, Elena. Yeah! Whoa! Oh! Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Looks good! Whoo! Whoa. Holy shit. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. It's on now. Pretty cool. Almost got you, sorry. Every step of the way, I'm learning something new. That's what's so exciting about it, is that you don't know what you're gonna find and it really brings out the creativity and, and the freedom to, like, see the mountain in different ways. And it really just connects you to that present moment, and I think gives you insight to where you're supposed to be, and you stop living so much in your head and more in your heart, and really more in just what's in front of you. Which I mean, I think that that's what we're all striving for. Yes! Yes! What a wild style! I mean, sanely. Hey, guys. - Hey. - Everybody's okay? Yeah, everything good. We are very careful. Thank you for looking out for our well-being, comma, I hope we get to meet again. San Diego Police, take note, for God's sakes. Whoo! We're doing it. Someone pulls up next to me, "You're on fire!" And I look down and there's just flames ripping out my exhaust. Jason, just be careful. There's a road at the back. There's a road. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I think so. - Seriously? - Yeah. Just like any raffle, baby, you gotta be present to win your prize. Oh. Whoo! Oh, violent. - Jesus. - I'm okay. Are there any roads down there? No. No roads. - Yeah. - Whoo!
