Please don't ask me why or any detail I don't know. I was really under stress after that. I can't live with the guilt that I'm in love with the same guy Madhura is in love with.

He's not younger than me, he is older than me. Go, find it yourself, yaar. - He's older; his name is Tukaram. Does she know to ride a bike? Because Tukaram... After meeting so many different types of boys in life. That gave me jitters. I wanted to be sure that you're not one of them. Madhura! Don't turn back. Such a big decision in our lives, we handed it over to others. How foolish we were! Half baked! We invite trouble with our fears. You can turn back now. Oh! If I knew you'd be so beautiful, I wouldn't have come to meet you. Beautiful! I would love to hear rejection from these lips. Your voice, your beauty and 10 grams of ginger, if we ground altogether and keep it on someone's forehead, his life will be blessed! Now, you can say no. Done? Yes. Now, may I speak? Sure. How much do you speak on the phone about food, I thought you would be so! I've got to feed you. And this white shirt. Do you always wear or for today's special occasion? It's nice. Give me a hug!
