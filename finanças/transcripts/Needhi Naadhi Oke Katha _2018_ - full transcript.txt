A medal or name in the paper or bundles of money and said why is this waste idealness Is a dog crossing lorry, a waste idealness? That dog would feel very happy when it crosses the lorry right? That too would feel happy within right? Then how can that be a waste idealness Dharmika? Who are all these to say no to happiness?

I just pretended Dharmika, shall we go and play? Yes, come on My dad played the main role in the conspiracy making me pretend Remember, you are wasting too much of time with friends Books are friends and friends are books for a student, understood? Take the books Dad, my eyes are burning - No dear If you wear these spects you look as an intelligent student to all Look, see in this mirror and you look great Do your home work Wow, intelligent girl Another name for obedience... Second major role played in the conspiracy was my school Principal Principal used to daily say in the prayer like I am great for whole 365 days All started praising me I’m a role model for all the students in school I too started enjoying that fake image So, the feeling that I am special in all started developing in me I was struck in the image of a good girl Ok, will all those coming to Ram V Sekhar class pretend like you did? Not just them but even that Ram V Sekhar also pretends Oh no, what’s this sounding so strange to listen? Will humans on this earth be so funny? It’s all an acting here Sagar Those who pretend more are the good people in this society You just said that you and I are different No, yours and mine is the same story All these days I lived with a fake image amongst the fake people Now, I wish to live in reality with you When the flowers just waking up are getting active Honey bees are landing over the pollen The cool breeze from the branches massaged all my body I have changed like the butterfly opening wings Nature called me to ride a swing in its lap I came to know today that I dreamt myself as the Sea Why will that Sky give a shade like an umbrella? Why is this earth carrying me for so long? Why have these fire and water developed bonding with me? Why has your story come and mixed so into my story? Yours and mine is the same story Yours and mine is the same story So, you say to write exams for your father right? Yes - Will you pass then? Why to write exams then? What shall I do then? Go and directly say your dad that you can’t write the exams Will that be good if I say so? Who would say no when you loyally say what you feel at heart? Daddy... - Hey, bring Grandpa’s photo.

Say what you are thinking to do giving up your studies I thought to give up studies but haven’t still thought what to do Oh, you didn’t think of anything and this is further great You don’t know what to do but have decided to give up studies First, I wished to see you as University first Later I felt enough that you come College first Then I felt enough if you pass the exam nd now I’m into a situation thinking enough if you write exam Seeing me in this situation, I feel What’s this son? This education is not ok now for me mom Hey, place your hand on the heart and say Have you ever thought about us even for a second? Have you ever thought about us even for a second?

I can do anything from these Cell point, Pan shop, Mechanic Shed, Assistant director in the film industry You can even beg on the roads Will you do such works for life long and live? Ok, will you write exams just for this time? No! These exams, my dad, house and society... I feel like running away from these Dharmika Have you seen Geethanjali film?

I too wish to run away somewhere similarly You in me and me in you - Sagar We became eyes for the carrying earth Come, we’ll go - where Come on, I’ll say Where? - Ooty I just said for fun I'm saying seriously The breeze flowing and the garden blossoming No, it’s uncomfortable for me Go and write your exams Those butterflies and these snow heaps get us together That bitter time is gone and the prison life will go, see Closing day and rising happiness, my body is not permanent Dear, my breathe has come back like the songs from the birds You in me and me in you have become eyes for the carrying earth Shall we get up early tomorrow and go for seeing Sunrise Do you know whether the fish swimming in pond feels thirsty? Do you whether the swan flying in the sky gets dirty? Though there are so many valleys, whatever society says and so much of sorrows, will the time change? Though others say anything or whatever happens, I’ll be with you That speaking parrot and the moon smiling and my shape is the freedom like the flying sparrow On the ruling sky if I’m like you, life is a war You in me and me in you have become eyes for the carrying earth What? What? We’ll stay right here, Sagar? Come on, I’ll say Now if you go home, your dad will ask where did you go leaving out the exams It would make a big fight and you’ll sit whole night feeling bad Say, is this all required? No way out, right? Why is your dad not agreeing when you are saying to live doing the work you know? Because he fears to lose his prestige in the society Your dad feels ashamed to be said that son of Deviprasad is working in a textile shop So, there is only one way out from this It is for you to come out of the house Coming out and... Coming out and keep doing what you know It’s wrong to do so right? No, it’s not wrong to let go anything which is not happy for you So, we shall look for a house right here None will know where we are Let’s both do a job each and live happily It’s great listening to when you are saying No Dharmika, let’s leave..

Did he say to wash clothes and cook? What does he have with him? Neither you nor I and half of the society have what he has what’s that? Loyalty and Sincerity! We’ll show up like to know what all we don’t know and live pretending He will not pretend so. He is an original man I’ll say one thing, listen. I’ll be quiet for anything but never when you say to marry a guy who is not settled in life What’s Sir thinking to do? Say something That is dad... I gave the list and you give a confirmation... Your dad will not speak with you, it seems Going away from house when harshly spoken and coming back after two days Is this any public chowltry to come and leave as and you when wish? It’s all his wish, either not to study and even to stop studies Cleverly going away from home on the exam day, we are all mad people here I’m saying again, life is not as easy to play cricket with dirty batch going to the ground Still, will he beg on roads in future without settling? Come on, how can he be without any ego, shame, fear or worry not to be having a settlement? Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking? What dad, always asking what I am thinking What’s here to think? Do I know anything? What idiot, why is the voice raising? I’ve been screaming to settle and don’t you think why and what are they saying to you? Not that, what I say is... What not? Why are saying opposite to dad, son? No consideration to elders... You’ll go ruined with no settlement in life Oh no, he is into anger again If you have so much anger, settle in hlife and show me. Not to shout again. Every waste idiot knows this to raise the voice.

Where are you going? What, my dad has no love on me? Are status and prestige more than me? Has he any peeped in from my house window?

Where is he? Where? - Hubby Get up idiot - Oh no, hand Oh no - It’s always someone scolding him but have you ever seen anyone praising him? And now I haven’t come to the hospital and not wished him it seems Deviprasad is a great master. I’ve received best teacher award for four times I’m a poet and intellectual. I’ve got my own image in the society But because of him, my prestige and status are at stake I’m a teacher who teach all that a human with no education is an animal And when an animal is coming out of my house means it’s so insulting for me We shall talk later hubby, let him eat Yes, let him eat He is eating right? He is been eating me up from 20 years and let him eat Hubby - I’m saying you again. If he again meets with accident I’ll not come or talk Seeing your face all these years though I had no love on him, I pretended so for you That day, though I know he failed in exams, I brought cake and celebrated his birthday because of you Hey, take him in and give him food - Come brother Go, go inside Listen to me hubby - Nothing more that you say and I listen now Because my prestige and status are more for me than him my prestige and status are more for me than him Yes, my prestige is important for me Your dad has more love on his prestige and status than you Your dad feels ashamed when he comes to know that Son of Deviprasad is working in a textile shop So, there’s just one way out and that is you coming out from the house Brother... Stop, dad is coming Take this maybe you’ll come back as it is raining Don’t return till you pass either a cyclone comes or it thunders That day you said to go somewhere and live happily right? I’m ready now, come let’s go We’ve been saying so many film news but what about the tickets?

Ok, ask him to come Thanks bro Get in fast sir, we’ll go Dad, stop please. Dad... Dad, take at least this umbrella. Dad... dad Dad... Am I not fit to at least hold umbrella for you? I don’t have enough brains to become a software Engineer, Doctor or a Lecturer like you My matter is just this much, say what could I do dad? If anybody asks you why your son is driving a cab say my son couldn’t study and had to do something for living I’m not into robberies or pick pocketing for you to feel ashamed dad I saw a news yesterday in the paper When parents were asked a question how do they wish their kids to be 78% in Canada 70% in UK said they should be happy it seems Parents from our country said they have to settle in life and earn huge money You are all seeing happiness in earning but where is the link in between earning and happiness dad? Ok, if there is happiness in earning why are Doctors and Engineers earning Lakhs undergoing depression and committing suicide? Happiness is not in earning money dad, it’s in doing the work we like Leave that, I’m very happy driving this cab dad Except a small pain that I’m away from you, mom and sister And about the settlement none knows what and when something happens in life, dad There are people working in Mechanic shed who turned Contractors There are auto drivers who developed to a stage giving work to a few Who knows, I may become the owner of this Taxi and grow to a stage giving work to a few Who knows dad when would life change someone? Come dad, let’s go home Get into the car Get in dad I’ve never cut a tree in life or harmed any living being. I’d just misunderstood you I for the first time am feeling to write a poetry about you, son. Language is not enough How much was the heart in pain to know the value of life?
