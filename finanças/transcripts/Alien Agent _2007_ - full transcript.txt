Our galaxy is many light years away from the solar system of your earth. Our planet is dying. The members of the guild, our governing rulers devised a plan, a desperate plan to find a refuge on another planet with no sentient beings. The search is slow and our people are losing hope. Our renegade military group had found the ideal refuge. It's leader did not care that the paradise was inhabited. He will destroy your world. They are already among you. They will steal what they need to build a portal that will connect our two worlds, killing anyone who stands in their way. I have followed them. It is my duty to stop them... ...at all cost. Bravo five, we have you on schedule. No one's following you. We will continue to monitor. Go and turn off two miles ahead. Warning, handle with care sensitive contents Bravo five, request status over. Bravo five, do you read, over? Request status. Bravo five, what are you doing, over? Finally. Come on, let's go. - Any resistance? - Nothing worth mentioning. - Are these the amplifiers? - Heavily upgraded, but it's compatible. And the portable generator is complete. - He's found us. - Secure the area. - Rykker. - We need to move. Now! Yes, it's Rykker. Take him out! - Get ready. - Let's do it. Come on! Take the shot. Take him! That's it. He's mine! Rykker! - That won't stop him! - It'll slow down. Isis said you would come. But you're too late. This world will die. You will die. Yes, I will. But not today. We've got everything changed as per your instructions. I mean, as you can see, the auxiliary power has been restored, but... I have to say, if anyone notices this place is operational again, like If Homeland Security would have come in knocking...they're department or the US government. They got more firepower than you can imagine. We'll take care of that. You just follow your instructions. But, but, but, but, but, but, but how do I know that you're going to keep your word to me? I mean...I mean... I mean I, I, I've seen the way you sort of treat these soldiers. You are important to us. If you're talking about why I'm important to you, I am an engineer, I know how to make this place work. I've got my master's in physics. You know could have been scientist, - the way thought. - No, I'm sorry. I sense your pain and suppressed by those who envy you. - You're talking straight. - I can see into your mind. You are loyal, but you are also passionate. - Yes, yes I am, I'm passionate. - You will not betray us, - I won't, no. - And for that loyalty, you will ne rewarded with power, the like of which no human on this earth has ever known. Thank you, thank you. You are one of us now. One of the chosen. Thanks Jeff. - Give you a refill? - Sure. How about a little extra sugar? - Cool it, Tom. - Just shut up, would you? - What time are you getting off? - Same time as always. You know, I want to take you out. - Will you just think about it? - In your dreams, pal. Already. - Tom giving me trouble, honey? - No more than usual. I can't do this. I have to get out of here. I can't take another day of being mob by this sexist creeps. I know it's not what you hoped for, but we promised your parents... You didn't promise them crap. You weren't even talking to mom when it happened. I'm only here because there was nowhere else for me to go. We've done our best for you, Julie, and you're putting money away. - Yeah, so I can get out of this town. - So you can go to college. - Can I get some coffee? - Coming, Ralph, one more sip of cold coffee won't kill you. I am sorry. You and Uncle Jim have been great, and I love living with you, I do. And I will miss you when I go to college. We will miss you, too. Next time, I'll just bite through my tongue. Hey, always say what's on your mind. You know our motto for 20 years, hasn't it Jimmy? Sure has. Your Aunt Lorry says what's on her mind, then we do what she says. Hey, you think we can get a check over here? One of these days, I'm going to throw those two jerks out of here. - I can take that over for you. - I'll take it. No problem. - Change your mind? - Let me think about that for a second. No. No. Can you be more direct? Whoa! Look at that. You know, I got a real one, look up with it in my behind. It's a woodpecker. - But that is exceptional... - Hey, you're hurting me. I'm sorry. - Let her go. - Hey, it's OK. I can handle it. Hey, hold on now, buddy. Hey, that's my friend. All right, you know... all right. Service is a pawn. Easy. He started it. Go on. Hey, thank you. That was really, really cool of you. - I'm Julie. - Nice to meet you. - You got a name? - It's Rykker. - You're not from around here, huh? - No, I'm not. I'm looking for a small lake secluded from the main road. Need some alone time? I know the feeling. - Contemplation is good for the soul. - So I'm told. There's a bunch of lakes at Spences Point about 15 miles from here, take the right fork, - then take your pick. - Thank you. - You know who the fellow was? - I didn't seen him before. I make him for a fed. I did exactly as you said. I kept it very simple. It had no TV, there's no stereo. The walls are very sparse. There's no photos out, of course. But I do put some biker chicks on... it's a joke, just very human. - It's fine. You may go. - OK, I'll go. Dispatch, this is Unit 5, we are headed northbound, on 95. ...over Copy that Unit 5. Unit 16 hello. Unit 16, dispatch...over Copy that. - There's something not right about him. - What are you talking about? He hit very, very hard. That ain't right. What the hell was that? A meteor shower? Closest you get to a shower. Take a look at this. Get back in the car. Amber, just get in the car. We better go. Welcome to your new world, commander. This is dispatch reporting an explotion at Ashford Lake. A meteor or something, And then it just crashed into the lake. We're in the car kissing, but we know what we saw, OK? Wrap this up. Sheriff... I thought you were a fed when I saw you in the diner this morning. You got that look about you. What happened here? A couple of teenagers making out in their car. Said they saw a flaming ball hit the lake. Kids were high as a kite. - Why do you say that? - Well, they watched a woman throw Tom Hanson's body into the lake, and then step back as they've seen dead body walked right back up out of the water. Sound like they're on something to you? Of course, now, he is gone missing. Jack Bradon too, they always at the tavern by 6:00. bartender, got the shooters line up waiting for then. This way! Down here! - I wondered how long it would take. - What's that? As soon as word spreads of a flaming spaceship has hit the lake, the crazies come crawling out. Their scowling in the bushes in an hour. Hoping they find some aliens that crept up out of the water. - This ever happened before? - What a flaming ball hitting the lake? Yeah. Well, this is going to sound crazy, but... yeah, I heard it out about 20 years ago. Some farmer reported it. Sheriff, you want to come have a look at this. We just found Jack Brenden's body lying over there in the trees. At least it looks like Jack Braden. Come with me, check this out. Right. How do you like your new host body, Saylon? It was suffice, you chose yours well. - You're proof? - People say that. You are well-organized. Very impressive. I would like to welcome you to my facility, sir commander. Who is this? Mr. Roderick is an engineer, he's restored the power for us here. I done everything that's been asked of me. I'm a loyal servant to the new order of the new world. Kill him. He's needed to construct the portal. Once complete, he will be expendable. How did you secured his loyalty? The promise of joining a master race of being a Earth ruler among his kind. - And he believe this? - Of course. He may live... for now. - Where's Kaylor? - He died in battle. No one from this planet, I assume. - A guild warrior was brought here by the... - I know who's sent him. Those cowards... the guild, rather see our race wither and die. This warrior, he was killed? - I sense he lived. - Sensed... - Was Rykker, was he? - Yes. I want you to bring Rykker to me... alive. I..I..I..I... I assume that have this all resolved, this whole kill meeting. I mean, I won't be too worried about this invasion. I mean, the excursion from like your planet to our planet. I'm your man, I can keep a secret for sure. Did you... continue to follow orders, and you will be richly rewarded. Thank you, sir, thank you, thank you, sure... commander. - Hey there. - Hey, you came back. Coffee is good. You're a cop, right? - Right. Julie, I've been driving around all morning looking for an abandoned power plant or damn, Somewhere where you wouldn't expect to see activity but there have been lights or trucks coming and going. There is an old power plant in Ashland Forest in the reservoir. It's been abandoned since the late '90s. But I have seen some lights in there and wondered what was going on. Thank you. Well, take care. Pardon me, pardon, pardon, pardon me, pardon. Excuse me, commander. Did you bring all these guys with you? They are your guys. Yes, they're mercenaries. I got that. Aren't you worried about betrayal? I mean, they are human, and you're taking over the planet. How do you watch your back? It's mind control. You don't have to worry about me, controlling me, I'm on your side. You know that. Is everything going according to our plan? We're ahead of our schedule. So I just want to know that... I mean, with what you're building here, when all of this is done, it's going to be like a portal, right? Like, like like a gateway from like your world all the way to us. I mean, I see a bunch of shock troops being shot down from the stars. I asked, why earth? We're coming home. Be right with you, folks. Go on. Hey! What are you doing? Stay off of my truck! Yeah! I trust you left no witnesses. Let me take a look. Get on the ATF. Get them listed all registered owners of 223 machine gun. Any stolen military weapons, anything of that sort. - Agent, I didn't get your name before. - Rykker. Witnesses said some guy just came in and starts shooting. Lorry is dead, she ran the place in 20 years, her husband Jim is lying outside by the pumps. This is damn tragedy. I know these folks a lot of years. Her niece is the only one who got a good look at the shooter, but she won't say a word. - You mind if I try? - Yeah go ahead, go ahead. She's probably despite my face. Could you recognize the shooter? - Did you see anyone else outside? - Yes. Describe him, not here, outside. - Come with me. - Take me with you. When you go, please, I've got no one now. Come on. You're not really a cop, are you? Can you describe the man who killed your uncle? It was a woman, - a beautiful face, long dark hair. - Thanks. Hey! Stop or I'll shoot! Stop! Suspect stolen a police car. Damn feds! I need to question a witness! Come on! - Why did you get into the car? - I told you, I'm coming with you. What are you doing? - Why did you steal a police car? - I need to hear the police reports. You go in first. Attention. Sector 7. a shipment is ready. I'm here to pick up my shipment. - Do you have a company name, sir? - Company Name? Yeah, I need an account number and an invoice number, sir. I don't remember. I'll go and get it. OK. Hold it. Hey, what's going on? - You know the bitch that killed my uncle, don't you? - Yes. - And the other guy? - He doesn't matter, she does. - Are you going after them? - Yes. Good, I'm coming with you. Hey! Hey, don't leave me! Where am I going to go? What am I going to do? You asshole! Dispatch false alarm at bio-electronics. Call back all units. - Where are you headed? - In the town. Yeah? Hop in. Kind of a lonely road to be hitching earlier by yourself. I had a fight with my boyfriend. He threw me out of the car. Nice guy. What's that, your boyfriend behind us? - Pull off the road! - Look, I don't want any trouble, all right? - Please, just lose him. - Why? Look, just pull off the road. You got it. Whoa! Hey, you're thinking about running out on me, right? - Of course not. - Well, how old are you? Old enough. - Old enough for what? - Old enough to have some fun. - Can you make sure he's gone, please? - Yeah. Hey! I've been expecting you. It's been some time since we've seen each other. I've never seen you like this. - Did you kill this man? - I didn't have to. - Who was he? - A criminal. That must have offended your high sense of moral value. - I'll live with it. - Join us, Rykker. This world is lost, you don't care about these people. I care about our people. Then be their salvation, don't destroy their only chance at life. I will not break the code. This isn't an ethical debate, Rykker. This is a matter of survival, we take this planet, or we die. There's another world we found without sentient beings. - That is a myth. - No. Saylon dismisses it, because of his own desires for conquest. - There is a chance for us on this other world. - But only a chance. This world will save us. This is your destiny. No, Isis. and it will not be yours. Go over there! Go now! Go! Kill him! Get up! Get up! - It's time to die, Rykker. - In your dreams. - Need a lift? - Yeah. - Where did you get the jeep? - Borrowed it from a bigger creep than you. Thanks for ditching me in the weeds. You're lucky I'm still even talking to you. How did you find me? I heard the gunfire, figured it might be you. - How badly are you hurt? - Pretty bad. Turn right at the next side road. - Where are we going? - My place. Somehow, I didn't think your bachelor pad would be a church. Water, bowl. You've been shot. What went through was left inside. Hand me that bag, please. Oh gross. What are you doing? Are you crazy? You can't do that without an anesthetic. OK, this is freaking me out. Who are you? What are you? They were talking in the diner about the meteor that crashed into the lake last night, about it really being a spaceship, and we're supposed to be ready for some alien invasion. - Was that you? - No. But you're not one of us, right? I mean, you're not earthly. - No. - That would make you an alien, right? I believe that's the... term you use. Then this isn't your body. No. - Did you kill him for it? - He was dying when I got him, drowning in the river. Those swarms of... What are they? They are me. They are the essence that is my life. So they brought this body here back to life. Yes. But back at your home, or your planet, or whatever, you do have a body. It's still there in spaces. Our species evolved from the oceans just like yours. But our oceans dried up. We will not survive as a species unless we find an escape. But it does not have to be this planet. - How did you find out about us? - We seeded your race an eon ago. Get out. - You mean you're like our ancestors? - Something like that. Wow! Hey, I can help you on your mission. It's for the human race, right? You can't. Oh, yeah? Who saved your ass from vampiro with a submachine gun? Move! Move! OK, alien pop, beam us out of here. I guess you guys don't have "Star Trek" yet, huh? - How are we getting out of here? - Go! Go! Come on! Move it! Move it! Come on! - Where's Sartek? - He's dead. - No lost there. - He was a believer in our cause. That cause included you. Where is Rykker? You let him escape! - I'll find him... tonight. I thought you heal those bullet wounds. There's only so much this body can withstand. Get your swarms of little guys to go to work. They are working, or else I would be dead. - Remember, they are who I am. - Got it. When your mission is over, will you take me with you? - No. - Why not? There's nothing left for me here. What about your family? The only family I had, I watched being killed. My parents died in a plane crash four years ago going to a golf tournament. So stupid. - You have friends. - Not. - School? - Graduated. - You wouldn't survive the journey. - Because I'm human? - Yes. - And you're not. Got it. I don't want to be alone. You have an inner strength. You won't be alone. They found us! No, it's not them. - You want to be useful? - Like I haven't been so far? Get us into that truck. Hey. - Hey. - Thanks. Yes, thanks. So whom do I have the pleasure driving tonight? I'm Julie, and this is my dad. My name's Rykker. Our car broke down, the batteries on my cell phone died, so we were really glad to see you. I bet you would. - Hey, you folks like country music? - Oh, we love it. - Pretty nice guy. - Yeah. Yeah, he is. You know, - I no see much of a resemblance. - I look like my mom. Yeah... We have to get rid of him and take his truck. Don't kill him. I wasn't going to. Now, this place has got the best prime rib in the whole county. Come on, let's go. Kelly's. Huh! I've been looking forward to this for a while. Yes, sir. - Got the door, right after you, miss. - Thank you. OK. Hey, Kelly, how are you? Mm, yes. Mm, this is good. - You ain't hungry? - He doesn't eat. - Hmm? - Much, he doesn't eat much. I love to eat. I've got a girlfriend in Nashville, one in Philly, and one in San Diego. And I swear, they don't know how I wolf it down and never manage to put on a pound. You two aren't father and daughter. What's the real story? We are eloping, come to find the Elvis preacher to marry us in Vegas. No, you're on the run. - This is a kidnap, isn't it? - No, no, I swear, it's not. Then who's chasing you? They were after me. Now they're after the both of us. I can't tell you who. - But we are the good guys. - I believe that. Well, - I wish you all the luck in the world. - We'll need it. I'm going to go to the little boy's room. You know, you two make a good team. Don't let anybody separate you. - What is it? - We've got to get out of here now. Back door! It looks really bad. Why didn't you regenerate? I've been away from home too long. Come on. What the... oh, man. Tell me about this mission you're on. Saylon leads a renegade faction of our world. He's building a gateway between our planet and yours. And more of you will come? Enough to conquer your world, enslaving people. I can't let that happen. When this is over and we stop this invasion, how do you get back home? Is there like a spaceship? Can you use the gateway? - My return is not important. - This is a suicide mission. I'll survive long enough. Those swirling particles, they're kind of beautiful, but they scare me. You shouldn't. These particles could be beneficial to your race, - evading a disease, prolong life. - That would be great. Can you make that offer to someone, like the president? I could, but Saylon won't. Julie... They're going to find us again. They always seem to know where we are. I figure were both going to die tonight. I want to know what it's like before I die. I'm not going to die. - Do you want me? - I'm not of your world. That's not why I asked you. Do you want to make love to me? You're not my type. Sure, I am, you just don't know yet. - Would you just hold me then? - Yes. - Sorry. - It's OK. - How's this? - Better. - How's this? - Julie. OK. Help me! Rykker! Let me go! You, you murdered my aunt and uncle. Who's this? Tom... - Who a... who is she? - She's been traveling with Rykker. - Yeah, we're friends, we're close. - Touching. Why is she here. Bait for Rykker. He'll come for me, and he's going to take all of you up! I trust that you'll not allowed your feelings to stand in the way of your duty. - I have no feelings towards Rykker. - That's a lie. You can't hide anything from me. My feelings for Rykker are dead. - How are you feeling? - Like I'm going to gag. When was the last time you took a shower? Listen to me, little lady, I'm the only friend you got in here, OK? We're human beings, we're going to stick together. - You're going to help me escape? - That depends. on how nice you are to me, you know? I mean they they know me, and they need me, I mean they they they need me they trust me. I've got the ear of the boss man. You understand what I'm saying to you? Sure, you're their lapdog. I remember you, I do, I remember from the diner. I remember you served me coffee and pie, like I was somethig in the bottom of someone else's shoe. - A little different now, isn't it? - Hey, sorry. I'm scared, you know. I remember you. What... - You gave me some pretty good tips. - I'm going to give you another one, OK? Now, you'd be nice to me, and I'm going to help you get out of here, OK? - They need you in the control room. - Roger that. I...I...I...I...I...I was making sure that these were taped. Give me a human word to describe him. Loser. I like it. I have to think of something different to describe you. Scum. We tends to forget that the casualties of war have families. So you're sorry you murdered my aunt and uncle? No. I'm making an observation that you are a primitive race. Yeah, I guess we didn't evolve into killers as fast as we've should have. Your ancestors should have scratched that little bit of information into our genes. - So you've been getting a history lesson from Rykker. - We talked about a lot of things. You've evolved into a weak and cowardly species, you allow your feelings to rule your judgment. And you don't? I get the feeling you and Rykker were pretty close at one time. We're bound in ways that you will never understand. But it didn't work out between you two, huh? Our ideals were the same, but our path changed. He did not believe we could enlave the sentient species, and I understood that there was no choice. Too bad, you lost someone very special. Feel lucky you got to spend time with one of the greatest warriors of our world. - He didn't try me very hard. - You are a child. - If you were any older... - He'd want to be with me. He will come for you, not because he cares about you, but because you have become a responsability to him. And he is a soldier who fulfills his obligations. And then he will die. Hang on tight. This is going to be a bumpy ride.. - If you run, you will be shot. - He'll know it's a trap. Of course, but he will come anyway. If you loved him once, how can you do this? Get out. They're waiting for you. When I move, you run. Follow the red lines along the walls, come to a ladder, it'll take you outside. - No, I won't go without you, I can't go without you. - Julie, just do it, Julie go, just please go! Go! Well, Rykker, it's nice of you to join us. - There he is! - You disappoint me, Rykker. I was told you were once the greatest guilt warrior of them all. - And you're the greatest traitor. - More lies and debate while our world dies. You'd rather see our people perish than to be their savior. There is another salvation to our world, you know that. But that's not your real goal. To enslave the species, that's the price. Enslave them? I want to exterminate them. Too bad your followers don't know who you really are. And you do. You're too consumed by your moral code and your honor to realize your destiny or to stop mine. It's a pity, I could have used your skills. Just hit him up! Shoot him. Kill him! Shoot him! All right, fine. Let him watch then. I go now to our world, Rykker. I will return with thousands. So beautiful. You should have joined us, Rykker, too bad. Take him away. Stop him! No! Oh this can't be happening. - Isis! - Saylon! The portal has not been destroyed. Come back with me, Isis. - It's too late for that. - No, it's not! Yes, it is. Far too late, you've condemned our people to death, this is the destiny that we have. Rykker. Rykker! Stop, Isis! - It's over now. - Not until death. Oh, boy, I'm so gone, I'm so gone. Isis? Hey, come on, you had to do it. You don't understand. She was a part of me. Come on. Help me up. Controls. - Hasn't it been destroyed? - No. Only overloaded from the power source. Here. - What's that? - You have to blow up the gateway. After you hit this button, you run. You're leaving. I can't stay. I have to return and find a way to save my race. Will I ever see you again? I don't think that will be possible. So this is it, don't forget about me. I won't. You sure this is one of your better ideas? It's a risk. - Remember, after you... - Hit the button, run like hell, got it. Wait! That wasn't so bad, was it? No. They tickle. - Good bye, Julie. - Good bye, Rykker. Julie! Julie. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm all right. And the bad guys are gone, it's over. You stay right here, sweetheart. I'll miss you. Nils. It's over, Rykker. The end of the old school. This is a new beginning. With the construction of the new portal, we will be unstoppable. You know, I can't allow that. If I'm to see my family again, that portal has to be constructed. And if I have to choose between my family and every human on this planet, well then, so be it. I had hoped you wouldn't come to this. This didn't go as well as you thought, did it? You can't win. I have to.
