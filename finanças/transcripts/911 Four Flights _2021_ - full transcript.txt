I was a flight attendant '' Peg Ogonovsky Hatch 11 The captain of the American flight captain. And he offered me a date. .I thought, well, he's cute. He's a pilot. That's pretty nice He was a certified pilot, but the truth is he was a farmer He came from a family where everyone has a farm But they also had a full-time job On September 11th a tour of our farm took place And he wanted to be a part of it So he searched for another computer. An available pilot who wants to take a flight , And I asked him how he was doing, and he said I'm only getting red lights, so I guess I have to go , Richard Ross "" 11 passengers, American flight My dad was late, often for things So I have very strong memories, chasing him at airports Just walk as fast as I could. To keep up with his pace That morning, he went to California for a one-day meeting Abigail Ross Goodman, daughter of Richard Ross. He leaves, turns around and returns home. On a relatively hot autumn day, he ran to the airport with his luggage And he came to the gate and called to my mother, in such a state of frustration Because he did not feel well from running He was not the most fit. Let's say he was not a sprinter My mother did not sleep the night before. She was particularly worried She wished him success on the trip, and they told each other that they loved each other And that was the last time they talked , Danny Satellite 11 passenger, American flight, that morning Danny Satellite woke up early 11 catch the flight of American Airlines For a business trip to Los Angeles It was a flight he made 30 times that year Danny was the founder of a remarkably successful Internet company Marco Greenberg, a friend of Danny Levin's great idea is to make time. Waiting online a thing of the past Technologically, Akamai has unbelievable technological power No matter what happens, we refuse to lose , His company, Akamai Technologies Has grown from this tiny company, to a multi-billion dollar company Molly Raskin, author of "The Right Time: Danny Levin's Life" and earning a lot of money and influence. The dot-com bubble has ended Danny focused like a laser on saving his company He got on that plane in a shirt, T-shirt and jeans and sneakers Armed only with Blackberry and his laptop Danny Levin sat in Session Nine in the Business Department Very close to terrorists So close to one of them, that if he had held out his arm He could have touched him There were a few things in Danny Levin that caused a lot of people to know him To believe he knew what was going on in this flight before anyone else knew For a start, he knew Arabic , He was from Denver, Colorado But when Danny was a boy, his father decided to move to Israel Danny did not speak Hebrew. He left all his friends behind .And it is exceptionally assimilated He also decided to join the elite unit of the Israeli army .elite forces It's about like Delta Force. In terms of combat And there were people in Israel who actually laughed in his face and said This unit is reserved for the best and brightest in Israel ".Who have been here for many generations" Danny did not just enlist, but became a commander In the unit we trained to kill the enemy with bare hands You were trained to kill the enemy with a pencil, if you had one Danny could have been more nerdy than nerds But he was not just a nerd He could literally rip someone's head off with his own hands When he went to Logan that day, he was completely focused on work At the same time, I believe that Danny is Israeli The Danish commander noticed the Arab officials surrounding him , Boston Center: American 11, climb. Maintain flight altitude three five zero Boston Center: American 11, Boston "" 8:13 in the morning Our controller attempted to transmit.11 Elevation Confirmation to American We did not receive recognition of the permit, from the flight crew And this is not always an exceptional situation In flight on a plane, there are distractions. They fulfill several tasks It will not be unexpected. A pilot will not answer on the first call Based on what we know, the abduction began around 8:14 a.m. , When the terrorists got up with weapons in their hands Danny knew something very bad was about to happen Everyone who knew him said that very likely That he tried to get up and fight back He got up and tried to save a life , What Danny did not know, what no one could have known He was the fifth terrorist in the flight. That day he was sitting right behind him Completely out of sight At 8:21 a.m. the controllers noticed, the loss of a transmitter Terry Biggio, Air Operations Manager and Traffic Controller at Boston Center. A sign that something is wrong with this flight The transmitter transmits information about your flight .Control air traffic If the transmitter is off, you do not know the height, you do not know the speed This is just a point in your radar American 11 is changing its course. Towards New York They assume he intends to return to the airport to land 11 Boston Center: Is this an American trying to call A broadcast made from the flight deck, of American 11 is intended for passengers But it was broadcast on the air traffic control frequency , There was a series of three broadcasts ... and these broadcasts began in Muhammad Atta: We have some planes "We have some planes." Muhammad Atta: Be quiet and we will be fine. We will return to the airport The other two sentences, though short, were chilling Muhammad Atta: No one will move. Everything will be fine If you try to do something, you'll hurt yourself and the plane Just keep quiet Then the cattle realize that there is a kidnapping He orders someone else to take out the tapes And analyze what he thinks he has just heard Hey, Tony, you're still there Herndon Center: Yes, fresh Terry: The guy said we had planes Now I do not know if it was .Because of the accent, or there is more than one I'm about to confirm this for you 11. We are dealing with American Our first indication that there are planes Really attracts our attention ? And what? Fresh: Aircraft, in the plural We? Re really worried. What next As a flight attendant, I lived in Boston for 25 years I flew on this flight with a lot of people who were on it that day .Betty Amy I flew with everyone Betty Ong: My name is Betty Ong. I'm number 3 on the flight A flight attendant from the plane called the center via a seat phone To announce that they are being abducted , Tear gas sprayed in the cabin And things do not look particularly good in the cockpit Betty Young: I'm behind. And the pilot's pilot does not answer their phone And there is someone who was stabbed in the business department Betty Ong reported that a passenger in the business class was stabbed Danny was definitely strong enough To take someone down. Using a box opener or a knife But he was not equipped to take down the five terrorists That one of them was sitting directly behind him You can be the most trained soldier, the best fighter But you can not know when someone came to you from behind He was almost certainly the first victim of the 9/11 events Looking at the heroes, who were lost that day, and were many ...but Obviously Danny Levin is at the top of the list for me 175 earlier United left Boston, also to Los Angeles It has 56 passengers and a crew of nine people Victor liked to fly in the cockpit He said he had the best seat in the hall He would know his flight attendants He treated his staff and passengers very nicely Alan Sercini, wife of Victor 175 Flight Captain, talk to anyone who knew him, they would say I've always had a great flight "" when I flew with Vic The flight attendants Michael Taro and Amy King were regular on flights from Boston Two of the kindest and most beloved people you will ever meet You're just excited when you see them on your team list They moved in together earlier in the summer Michael was a great guy The kind of people who when she talks to us he looks at her We all believed they were getting married .I first met Brian at the bar I never knew that "love in the sky" is a real thing I always thought it was a movie , And the night I met him He gave me his phone number on a business card , And it was actually written there. "Lieutenant Top Gun" Julie Sweeney, Ruth's wife, Brian Sweeney, traveling and I thought, God, this is the worst way. Most try to start with someone , But he was so beautiful. And his height was over eighty feet , And I looked at my girlfriend and said I can see myself getting older with him sometime , 175 Boston Control: United .133.42, Contact Boston Center United 175: one three three four. Two. United 175, Good Day Victor took off, and all is normal for the first 15 minutes Ascend, change frequencies And air traffic control.11 requested the location of an American flight : Boston Center, look at your 12 to 1 hour 16 miles south Look if the American 767 is there please Victor Sercini: We're looking for .175 Negative Contact, United 11. The transmitters went off in America The controllers do not know the height And there are other planes in the area that they need to take care of Then United 175 confirms.11 that it can see American Victor: We see him, he looks twenty, twenty-nine Twenty-eight thousand Victor replied that he was not there, at the height he was supposed to be at And that he is not in the direction in which he is supposed to be 175 The controller knows that it puts .11 on a collision course with American : Boston Center, turn 30 degrees right I want to keep you away from this movement , Victor: Thirty degrees to the right.175 United And he keeps trying to keep everyone away from this hijacked plane American 11 was already 75 miles south .From its designated route See a plane flying on the ground, at a speed of 600 knots Which are about 690 miles per hour, heading south This is clearly not normal. They were definitely in a hurry At the same time, the flight attendants continue to transfer valuable details to the land Betty Young: The flight attendant from the first class and the economy were stabbed We can not even get into the cockpit We do not know who's up there I do think about what happened to John and his co-pilot Tom John was eighty feet tall His co-pilot, Tom McGuinness, was also a great man It's completely impossible for any of these men Willingly relinquished his seat in the cockpit .They turned forward. Belts .They were in a position of tremendous inferiority ... dead as I suspect they died ...It was .Cruel : United Airlines Focus? All right, Betty You're doing a great job, just stay calm, okay? Betty told them exactly what was going on, it took courage to do so Because even if you could see, three kidnappers That does not mean they were not. Three more are watching you Focus: Do you have any information about the men in the cockpit with the pilots? Are they first class? They sat on two islands and two Betty Ong and Amy Sweeney managed to say goodbye Where did the kidnappers sit? To identify them The flight attendants that day suddenly passed From being the emergency forces, of the aviation world , Sarah Nelson President of the Association of Stewards who are responsible for safety, passengers and their health The last defense line of the airport In case of hijacking, from a point of view, of air traffic control A protocol from past cases will make us believe that the plane is about to land .And some demands were raised before us , And we want to make sure the military knows so they can provide us with support So Boston calls the Northeast Air Defense Sector , In Rome, New York Which is part of the North American Air Defense Command Coincidentally, the command was on the second day, of a large imaginary military exercise "So-called" vigilant guard We did such great exercises. About twice a year This is a way for us to imagine how we would act If we had to move from a peace period to a war It was a wide-ranging exercise of the Air Command .It included Russian aircraft This included a kidnapping scenario in which .C-130 was abducted by Bosnians or Serbs Major Quinn Nasifani, Commander of the Mission Team, and they were about to fly him into the United Nations. These army officers are preparing to hijack a mock plane When this event really happens, they can hardly believe it : Air Defense: The Slayer's Weapon, "Sergeant Powell" , Boston Center: Hi, Boston Center We have a problem here, we have a hijacked plane heading for New York We need someone to launch some F-16s or something Let them help us : Air defense? Is it real or exercise : Boston Center. No, this is not an exercise, not a test : Air defense. Okay, hey, wait a minute Boston Center: Yes !Hey! Hey I received very excited phone calls Major General Don Deskins Deputy Operations Control. Boston Central on the line. We have a hijacked plane. Hey, this is Major Deskins Do you have a general location regarding where it is located? : Boston Center. We're still following it right now I run to the battle station and talk to the sector commander He says, "Yes, pick up the planes." Air Defense: "Slayer" sends Panta 45, 46 to battle stations I'm going back to battle stations Major James Fox: I do not know where I'm sending the guys I need direction, goal I asked for two F-15s from Autis We were given the authority to launch them and leave They have access to aircraft at two Air Force bases , Otis, in Cape Cod. And English, in Virginia We were not allowed to ascend to the state of my voice. In a time of peace on land This was one of the regulations But I chose to fly fast. By voice all the way Colonel Tim Duffy Pilot F-15, Operations Officer I thought I would be responsible when I returned. If that was a wrong decision But I just wanted to get there fast Our procedures that day for the plane, abducted were to get in behind the plane Follow him, stay invisible. And see where he lands None of this happened : American Airlines Focus? What's up, Betty? Betty, talk to me Betty, are you there? The flight attendants at the back of the plane reported what they knew , And what they can see. It must have changed very quickly in the end Betty, Amy, they must have all been terrified The last things Amy said, just burned my soul And I never forgot them Amy tells us something's wrong , How close they fly to the ground, and how the plane flies unstable She said, "We are flying low. We are flying very, very low I see the water "" God, we're too low Then there was silence At 8:46 and 46 seconds.11 I watched American On our radar screen When that destination was gone, it was very clear .Sorry 11. It was clear we had lost American Something devastating is happening on the southern tip of Manhattan Island Reports this morning that a plane crashed on one of the towers of the World Trade Center : New York Center. Boston, this is New York What kind of plane was the American? : Boston Center.767. Boston lost track It was very clear that American had crashed at this point And we watched it crash. On our radar screen New York Center: Kennedy Towers Candy Towers .Fire in the World Trade Center This is the area where we lost the plane Apparently, a plane crashed into the World Trade Center here in New York I had this vivid memory of being in the licensing office , And watch alternating numbers while waiting in line ... and just be aware of it As time goes on, I guess We receive information that this is a small passenger plane And of course, we will let people know as soon as we have more information What actually caused it My mother was waiting in her car And when I got to her, she said, "A plane crashed at the World Trade Center." It did not connect me at all to my father I knew he was flying to California If you're traveling west, why fly south? What it really made me was, take care of my best friend Stacey Lee Sanders , She just started at Marsh & McLennan. On the 96th floor of the North Tower , There are probably six more women, seven women who would say No, Stacey was my best friend Because she had the ability to make you really feel like the center of her world I kept calling, to Stacey's cell phone , And I became more and more panicked because I could not reach her on the phone And she was not the kind of person who would not answer at such a moment One plane was American Airlines ... a Boeing 767 from Boston I listened to the news. They said the plane originated in Boston And I had this realization that maybe. I lost both Dad and Stace And I remember screaming in the car. The shock of it .⁇ This possibility⁇.⁇ The improbability of it It was It passed over the bottom, of the screen The first plane was a 767 from Boston .767 American Airlines And I just remembered getting down on my knees and looking at my mother : And I said, "It's John. It's John's plane." I flew this flight. Much more than John flew How could it be that it was John that day I thought about it a lot One of the highlights on that morning of September 11th Is the way random decisions, which we all make a thousand times a day , Which flight to catch if departing for an earlier flight Gareth Graff, "Super," the only plane in the sky, or for a later flight. Do you travel on Mondays or Tuesdays? Ultimately it is to determine the difference between life and death , That morning Seth McFarlane, "creates" a family man Was supposed to be.11 on an American flight And he arrived at the airport. Just 15 minutes too late His travel agent typed the time incorrectly in his schedule The same pattern of small decisions that make the difference between life and death Repeat on United 175 flight from Boston Brian had to travel every month for his new job And he always flew to Los Angeles. It became a pattern , Flew on Monday. And he always came home on Friday , Sunday night, September 9. We had a really nice weekend Perfect weather in Cape Cod "He looked at me and said, 'I'm not ready for work tomorrow." So I changed my flight "" .Three morning My husband and I were getting ready to go to the chimney To celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary Amber King's sister Deborah Lloyd asked Amy if she could take care of the children Amy and Michael both changed ... their schedules So they can be in Chicago. Take care of our kids When Flight 11 flew, to the World Trade Center Attention in New York Central.175 moves to United : New York Center. United 175, New York , 175 United? You hear New York I was in charge of the air transport system .In the Northeastern United States Knowing we have a real kidnapping We had controllers that scanned their airspace 11. and searched for American : Mike McCormick? Who's calling me on the B line? Bruce Barrett: Bruce Mike: All right, Bruce, what do you have? Bruce: We have just received reports that there is a fire at the World Trade Center Newark said it looked like a plane crash In the tower in Newark, they confirm it. That's what we heard. Mike McCormick, Director of Air Transportation, New York Newark Inspection Tower Center has confirmed that planes have hit the World Trade Center. At the same time, I hear in the background. "Becker says:" I have another one I can not catch, the United 175 at all right now And I do not know where he's flying I lost all communication with the plane , Mike McCormick: Hey, Bob. Bob. Maybe we have two things at once .OK At that moment, it was no longer one hijacked plane We have another plane that we're following ... after him. He also appears to have been abducted We may have multiple terrorist activities , 175 United, Dale, Robert Fangman .Connects with United Focus , He reports that the plane was hijacked and the pilots were killed And one of his colleagues, a flight attendant, was stabbed The call from Robert, I have a hard time imagining What's going through his mind? How they will survive All I can say is that I know Michael and Amy They would do whatever they could To try to comfort everyone who is really having a hard time, and help them , 175 New York Center: United? Hear New York? United We were able to follow United as he flew south toward Manhattan The cattle, now he's out of his comfort zone , He is dealing with one hijacked plane and a plane hitting the World Trade Center We had one expert: for traffic control he said Know what? We need to "tell these pilots Put the emergency ax in their lap. "" Secure this cockpit The mornings immediately rise to their connection And inform all aircraft of their frequency .Secure the cockpit Multiple kidnappings in full swing. This is something that does not sound like it This is a coordinated attack on the United States By 9:00 a.m., at least two Boston planes had been hijacked And airport security. Could not stop any of them , John Farmer 9/11 Senior Consultant, Part of the 9/11 Multilayer Security System Committee - which existed at "There was a so-called" caps "system. A computer-assisted passenger filtering system Designed to identify passengers that need to be looked at more closely Then there were security measures taken to try to prevent kidnappings The protocols for identifying the terrorists have indeed succeeded In Washington, the kidnappers were marked for further investigation , But even then No one looked twice, at the weapon, at the knives In the Japanese knives they had planned. To board the plane that day Muhammad Atta was actually identified as a high-risk potential target .And so he was detained for further examination But the result of the marking, was not to prevent them from ascending But simply do not load the bags onto the plane until it is confirmed that they have boarded The thinking on September 11 was that a terrorist was not going to get on a plane with a bomb .Because they may be harmed , The idea of ​​a suicide bomber, of a suicide pilot Has never been perceived as a serious threat There was a failure in the imagination of the whole system After all the dollars we spent, there was nothing anyone could do Everyone got on planes. They've gone through it all. All layers of security .Now they are sitting in these seats. And at this point, it's just a matter of time "Dallas Airport, Virginia" .American 77: Good Morning, Ground .77 American 77 Three-Zero Ceremonies, American Flight 77 of American 757 was Boeing Departing from Dallas International Airport in Washington, DC He also flew to Los Angeles Jan Ramirez, Chief Curator of the 11/9 National Monument and Museum.

You know who he is Access Control New York: Unknown. We're just picking it up now New York, Central: Caution. It looks like another one As an experienced pilot, I think Brian concluded very quickly That this plane is not going to land. Nowhere safely , The speed at which that plane flew, the altitude at which that plane flew , In the last minutes I do not think he had any thoughts that this plane was going to land safely United 175 is getting closer and closer. To Manhattan, I see on screen New York Center: Hey, can you look at your window now? -Yes Can you see someone, about four thousand feet high , About 5 east of the airport right now ... looks like he is Yes, I see him Do you see this guy? He's also lowering to the building It also goes down really fast.

In the easiest way ... and just knowing that my sister is there This is the picture I see.

Have fun The same for my parents and everyone I'm just loving you very much, and I'll see you when you get there Bye, honey. Hope I call you Then he said, "Hopefully. I will call you" and he hung up I think at that moment I knew he was gone .I'm sorry He would never call me. "He says," See you when you get here Because "here" was not LA It was nowhere but where he believed he was going And that's his belief. That he will see me again It still helps me get through the day .Every time again About ten minutes ago there was a big explosion Did you hear the explosion from your position? Oh, there's another one. Another plane just hit My God, another plane just hit It's just flying into it. Into the second tower. It was a plane It was a very large plane. It flew into the World Trade Center Flight 175 is the moment when everything changed on September 11th America's innocence will disappear forever U.S. officials say the bomber struck shortly after noon in front of a U.S. military base It was Victor's plane that signaled to the world that we were a nation at war It was a deliberate act , Dan Cridon, Controller Airport Reagan Airport These are people who are trying to kill people on the ground I was angry that our country was attacked , Significantly and more emotionally I was angry that someone would use, something I really like, aviation And will use it as a weapon , 77 American Airlines, flight "" 8:56 in the morning : Indianapolis Center .American 77.American, Indie .American 77, Indy .American 77.

At this point I felt I had to explain to her What happened to the two planes that crashed at the World Trade Center in New York?

I just want the message to be "I just want to know you're fine" , New York Center: United 93, climb .Keep one six thousand , United 93: Climbers .Keep one six thousand 93 By the time United entered Cleveland's airspace We already knew what happened to the first three planes Rick Katal, Director of the Air Control Center, Cleveland. At this point, everyone is in action Indianapolis, Cleveland Washington.77 Center looking for an American Dallas Tower: We tracked an object moving rapidly toward the White House We notified the National Access Control. We notified the White House They transferred it to the army Call the Air Force to report That an object in an unidentified trajectory is approaching the capital Washington Major Kevin Nasifani. He turns toward Washington OK? I think we should, bounce off Langley right now And I'll take the fighter jets from Otis And I'll try to chase this guy. If I can find him The two types of fighter jets we had 16-There were nose planes, sitting alert in Langley And we had F-15 aircraft from Autis They are armed interceptors that could have been aired : Major Nasifani. Foxy, Bounce Langley Led him in the direction of the Washington area. -I got I want things done, I want them done fast I was very frustrated. I had four planes How am I supposed to protect this whole area? With only four planes They know they need to take more planes into the air But they no longer have fighter jets They began informing all units Do you have fighter jets? We need fighter jets Major Don Deskins. There's another plane with the potential for hijacking We are trying to find available properties That we can air as quickly as possible They're trying to get Toledo Bring them with weapons too .Two in Alpina, they will have weapons I have two more from Toledo and two in Sue City The Secret Service in the White House is also calling for a backup Our Squadron in the National Guard, of the District of Columbia .Our nickname is the beer keepers That morning we received a phone call from the White House America is under attack. We need help Send all the planes that you can fly now At that moment, my boss, General Dave Worley, came in Major General Dan "Resin" Kane Weapons and Tactics, Air National Guard, and I was able to say, "Hey, sir." This phone call is for you. We put on the equipment and came back General Worley read our classified assault rules When did I shoot someone? When did I not shoot someone? , And he says, "Look, Dan I do not know what. "You are about to face outside "And I do not know what you will have to do" but I want you to know That I trust you. You'll do the right thing, no matter what "You have my support." General Worley received orders and transferred firing authority to his pilots He never spoke in person to the vice president It is impossible to think of such a thing. And they would not approve of such a thing But it happened on September 11th And the U.S. military is preparing to wage war , 77 American Airlines, flight "" 9:34 in the morning Reagan Tower: Washington Control : Dallas Tower. This is Dallas access control We are tracking an object that is moving rapidly toward the White House We were notified to the White House Many feared that the flight was aimed at the White House The crew was told to flee And the Secret Service smuggled Vice President Dick Cheney and other officials Into the bunker below the White House Dallas Tower: A major goal. Towards the White House We have no idea. What height, what type It was a very intense moment We told the tower, stop all the exits. We do not know what's going on Don? T let anyone out Do not let anyone out. The entire metro area is closed We knew immediately that it was a plane We had no idea it was a civilian airline plane Not to mention one who was abducted What's his position right now? 10 miles southwest, to the White House Makes a right turn. In a southwesterly direction. fast It's moving away from the White House at this point They rotated this plane at an angle of about two kilometers We're asking, "What is this guy doing?" Heading north. Back towards the White House Is there a chance it could be military? do not know- Fighter pilots are not yet in range. Others are not in the air 130-But there is an International Guard C, which flies near Reagan Airport 130-and the controller transmits to the pilot To see if he can help. Identify what this plane is 06, the traffic is at eleven o'clock, and eight miles north Moves at an unknown speed, type and height .12 06, we have traffic in range, at Do you have traffic? You see what it is? Can see Looks like 757, sir. My heart sank, and ?Oh My God. 757 American? Where did they get this plane from? ... in retrospect, looking back I felt a certain guilt in not understanding That this is a plane with 70, 80 people on board The traffic of 06 is still lowering, and it seems to be facing northeast They were in full throttle, and the speed only increased I can not imagine how the people on the plane felt It seems to be just northwest of the airfield at this point, sir They knew they were, just a few hundred yards from the ground Because they looked out the window to the west, and could not see it He was so short .Now the main one is gone Central is gone. Five miles from National Exactly at this point .We lost the radar connection Looks like this plane crashed into the Pentagon, sir , My friend, Dina Tara, called and said Hey, this 757 "". Just hit the Pentagon "! We say," Damn it Hi, Dallas. This guy hit the Pentagon. -I know- Another big explosion took place this time in the country's capital The plane flew so low in its final takeoff That he actually broke streetlights on the way We do not know if this is a result of a bomb, or if it is another plane When we watched TV, we saw smoke rising from the Pentagon I was very worried that this was Barbara's flight, that she had crashed That she was murdered along with the other passengers on that plane , And with the disclosure of the details. It was indeed a commercial aircraft An American Airlines plane flying into the Pentagon , Even though I knew it was coming ... I was amazed to understand .What I already knew , The appalling realization is spreading that is also a symbol of our military power Proved to be vulnerable The drama moves on from a terrorist attack on New York , For a terrorist attack against the nation, using its symbols Smoke billows from the Pentagon, the White House is in the process of evacuating And here in New York. Everyone is of course on full alert All the airports, the tunnels and the bridges were closed I live right by the river, so simple. I crossed the West Side freeway And I looked south The two towers could be seen burning And hundreds of people are evacuating from the city center I just remember that it was like the end of the world, Barbara Rachko, wife of Brian Jack. , My husband, Brian Jack.25 has worked at the Pentagon since he was a son We heard about the plane crash , And my first thought was Oh, God, thank God. "Bryan is not in the Pentagon today "Brian is going for a walk" He left Dallas at 8:10 p.m. .77 and it was American I remember I was in shock, and And I remember telling strangers on the street "I said, 'I just lost my husband.' And they were all in the same mood as me Whether you lost someone or not We were all Russians They evacuated all the people in Washington. The capital and I took the train home .I actually turned towards the Pentagon .and I could see smoke When I got to school, there was a big buzz in the building Everything happens. Then someone said that a plane hit the Pentagon , I turned to two of my co-workers, and I just told them, I said "It was my daughter's plane." "77 Asia Kotom, Traveler, American" I just felt something. To this day, I can not tell you what it was But I felt it in my heart. That's what makes it so bad At one point, I just raised my hands and said , But still, God. "" It's involuntary. This is what you want done , And my mom was mad at me. She said, "Why do you say that? It's going to be okay." But I just knew in my mind that she was gone Do you know how to say that certain people can feel things? .And I just felt, that's what I felt I would not tell Michelle or anything. Because I did not want to lose hope It was clear until at least mid-afternoon Flight 77 hit the Pentagon , I know she did not suffer, for God is merciful And he would take her before she was. Feeling pain and anguish She got on the plane, and I believe she went to sleep And her teacher covered her. No matter what happened, she covered it : Herndon Center, if you have any unusual situations Or misplaced aircraft, identify them. Please contact us here at the command center At the Command Center of the Federal Aviation Administration in Herndon, Virginia Ben Seleini. He is the National Operations Manager I'm in air traffic control. '60-since the '5s But on September 11th, it was my first day in this role The American 77 collided with the Pentagon, according to reports At this point there were over 5,000 planes in the sky I did not know who was a friend and who was an enemy He knows he has to close everything. Without waiting for orders or approval .He says, so be it Even if my first day, will be my last It's about to stop All over the country, I issued an order to land all the planes : Herndon Center. All aircraft on the ground All aircraft, regardless of destination, land as soon as possible The decision is a decision of A decision that has never been made in the history of the United States Do not let anyone out of your airspace To the United States of America This is due to a national emergency that is currently taking place Ben Seleny, National Operations Director of the National Air Guard. It was entirely my responsibility to do whatever I deem necessary. I thought it was necessary at the time, and I still think so today All aircraft entering the United States Everything moving in the United States. Every plane, everywhere, stopped It was now a matter of viewing, of the dwindling meter .3,000⁇ -⁇ down to⁇ 4,000⁇,⁇ l Amazing to see all the dots, in the radar, like ants Disappear when United States airspace empties , And for the first time in American history. The army ruled the sky There is one plane that does not respond to commands from the ground "93 American Airlines, Flight" It appears that an aircraft of some kind did indeed hit the side of the Pentagon I remember sitting on a plane at the Andrews Air Force Base I'm staring at the sharp black smoke rising from the Pentagon , When sliding the missiles on the track You can feel displacement in the plane. When these missiles are locked Pay attention to all the planes that track the frequency of the Andrews Tower I hear the air traffic control of the Federal Authority on the emergency frequency No general aviation aircraft is allowed to enter Bravo's airspace Any violation will be reported And I remember thinking, this is us. We're about to knock someone down : Newark Tower, United 93 Back to normal speed 35 Contact Exit, 135 point United 93: One three five. Three five, normal speed. Good Day , 93 Things are pretty calm on the flight Forty minutes into the flight When Captain Dale looks: and sees a message that says Beware of intrusion into the cockpit. Two "" planes hit the World Trade Center This is not the type of message an airline captain expects to see So when Captain Dahl receives, this message, he writes back Ed, please confirm the last message "". Jason A minute later, air traffic control.93 calls for traffic to United , 93 Cleveland Center: United, the traffic for you is at one o'clock 20 miles east. Three-seven-zero : 93 United .Negative connection, we look Forty-five seconds after that, a very normal radio message You hear what you can not think. That is nothing but a struggle We had a terrible broadcast. It's just a terrible sound You can hear that they were attacked United 93: Monday! Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here , Whenever a pilot gets involved the first way he transmits For air traffic control is "using the term" instantaneous, instantaneous He took the time to do so At the same time, it is clear that he was fighting with people who were in the cockpit It shows his training, and his commitment Because it really helped us It was their plane, it was their job Take care of their plane. And take care of their passengers .And they tried their best You can hear the attack going on Within minutes they were in control of the plane : Cleveland Center. United 93, Cleveland .United 93, Cleveland Are you with United? .United 93, Cleveland .If you hear the center, which It was just very disturbing 93-The control calls. And receives no response back Do you have a connection with United? South of Chardonnay We hear some strange voices, we're trying to get them Do you have them? , 1523 United, have you heard of any frequency interference here ?a few minutes ago? Screams.797, yes- , 1060 here American. General regarding the other broadcasts About two minutes later, they hear another broadcast on their frequency , Ziad Jarrah: Ladies and gentlemen. This is the captain, please sit down .Continue sitting. We have a bomb on the plane It's one of the kidnappers who thinks they'm talking to their passengers But, again, they transmit .for air traffic controllers Cleveland Center is calling. You are unreadable. Speak slowly again In this broadcast you said, that it is unreadable Sounds like someone said he had a bomb on the plane That's what we thought. It's just ... we did not understand it .Ziad Jarrah: This is the captain. You all stay to sit , There's a bomb on the plane and we're back to the airport .To meet our requirements. Please, keep quiet It was a terrible thing to hear firsthand I will never forget his voice. It made my body shiver I understood for a moment ... oh, God. It happens here too And you can not live in this moment ... but your humanity And I'm in tears now ... if you're going through this You see, there are people on these planes And you realize you saw the plane. It hits the World Trade Center And so, I knew the meaning of what we have here , My older brother, Luis Joseph Naki II , Whom I call Joey.93 was on a flight deck Joey sent a cargo of toys to the West Coast And these toys did not arrive My father taught us to talk to people We look them straight in the eye We have a firm handshake. And our word is our promise Ken Naki, Joey's brother 93 travels to United so instead of Joey sending someone to the beach, West to solve this problem He decided to fly there and make it a day trip Flight details set for September 10 , My older sister, Honor Elizabeth Winnie 93. She would travel to United Lizzie was everything I think. Someone would want her sister to be She taught me the projector, before anyone else And it was very, very cool It's hard to imagine, but it used to be very cool I would call her busy Lizzie , And I told her, just before we hung up Sarah Winnie, Elizabeth's sister 93 Winnie, traveling United, 14 I'm about to start high school I do not have to go on. "To call you more busy Lizzie And she said, "Sarah, you always are." Can call me busy Lizzie And that was the last time we talked , My wife, Lauren Grandcules was in the third month of her pregnancy With our first child She is just as strong as any man I have ever known Even though she was a tiny woman She was very excited and shared her pregnancy with her sisters and her mother and father She was waiting to return home, so she left for NAMAT very early in the morning Jack Grandcouls, Lauren's husband 93, travels to United and it's ironic that Lauren has never been to an airport early in her life. She was not originally on United's 93 flight But since it was an empty flight, in terms of passengers And she was there early, they asked her if she wanted to be on that flight "And she said, 'Sure : Lauren Grandcules Hi, I just want to let you know That I'm on an eight-hour flight. Instead of ninety-twenty So I'll get to San Francisco at about eleven And I'm probably at the ferry terminal? A little before twelve, okay? I'll call you then, goodbye United 93 flew west. Climbing from 35,000 to 41,000 feet It was pretty standard up to about five miles from Cleveland Center Flight 93 made a pretty dramatic turn. One immediate left turn The plane almost collided with itself, it's not a fighter jet We do not turn over like this in an extreme way Then the broadcast went off the plane. Then something very critical happened For a split second I received a message that showed that the plane was 8,000 feet high Then the plane plunged, in a matter of minutes. From 41,000 feet This is a fairly deliberate decline 93. Herndon Center: OK, United. , Are 29 miles away, error 29 minutes outside of Washington DC , 29 minutes from Washington, DC This is the one that changed direction in Ohio What will be the possible destination? Will it be Camp David? ? It's going to be the White House? Is it going to be the Capitol? Flight 93 is interesting, because first of all the flight was delayed .She took off later than the others Also, the hijackers did not take any action until much later in the flight This is one of the mysteries of that day , Unlike the other flights We get a lot more .93 phone calls coming out of United , But they are different .because people know more And they give passengers information "Their family members told them, 'Hey, they're going to kill you." They're not going to "" land anywhere , And unlike any of the other 93 passenger flights aboard United There is this information. And they make choices Once the passengers and crew, overcame this initial shock They managed to charge each other. A kind of accumulation of power from each other There were a total of 40 passengers and crew I think it allowed them to act All 40 have planned a plan. Vote for this plan And execute this program 93 at 9:38, United flight She's the last of the four hijacked planes still in the air In the cabin, the passengers and flight attendants work together to prepare a plan They voted. They will not let their plane serve as a missile The flight attendants start boiling water that they plan to use against the kidnappers They have a drinks cart They immediately decided who would play which role .And really united for one purpose They were getting ready to storm the cockpit In flight 93, 37 calls were made At 9:39 a.m., Lauren Grandcols left her husband a second voicemail Lauren: Honey, are you there? Jack. Answer, baby Well, I just wanted to tell you that I love you We have a small problem with the plane. I'm fine I just love you most of all Just know it, and ... you know, me, me You know, I'm comfortable. And I'm fine, for now Just a little problem, so I'm just loving you Please tell my family that I love them too. Bye Baby She tried to stop me from worrying about her It told me I should be okay with what happens, even if it does not work out She probably knew there was little time to do what they needed to do , Elizabeth Winnie "" 93 travels, United The phone call between my mother and my sister Was one of the last 93. phone calls from United One of the first things: what my sister said was Mom, I'm calling to tell you, "I love you "And my plane was hijacked." "My mother said, 'I hug you.' Look out the window. it's a beautiful day" Try to focus on the clouds " We do not know what is going to happen Even though they both knew , My sister said something like They're getting ready to break into the cockpit. I have to go "". I love you. Peace It was about 10:00 in the morning when I saw the broadcast At an altitude of 8,200 feet Between 10:00 and 10:02 approximately .I saw the dramatic references I saw him turn south. I saw him turn north Very extreme inquiries that you will never see. A commercial plane does 93. Herndon Center: United. He shook his wings as he passed Hoy They do not really understand what this means. This movement of the wings It was the fight in the cockpit The kidnappers start, go up and down and go up and down And do everything in their power to undermine the stability of the rear passengers Attacking the cockpit The FBI and family members heard the recordings from the cockpit But they were never released to the public , However, based on transcripts We know the hijackers started discussing if it was time to smash the plane ?This? We'll close the matter. "No, not yet - "When everyone comes in, we'll do it." They know they're losing this battle, and this cockpit door will break open .Passengers enter this cockpit It's pretty clear that the passengers knew that they would probably not be able to land safely The hijackers turned the plane over and aimed it at the ground The last words on the plane were the hijackers "Repeat" God is great. In Arabic seven times Then an English-speaking voice. "Shouts," No. , 93 Well, on United there is a report of black smoke , At the last location I gave you, 24 miles south of Johnstown From the plane or from the ground. It hit the ground. My father told me Your sister called your mother and informed her that the plane she was on had been hijacked , 14 and I was a girl. "So I said, 'Dad, it's going to be okay , They will fly a plane next to this plane, and there will be some metal bungee rope And people will get a rappelling ring, and they will skate on the rope And she's fine Now we know that the plane has already crashed But in every piece of my young being I believed there was another chance. Things would be fine I had the honor of listening to the recording in the cockpit that included my sister While listening, there are times when you hear the voices of passengers and crew And the amazing thing about my eyes is that they are calm .Purfaced They all sacrificed their lives that day And I think it's because, 33 passengers and seven crew members Everyone on this plane made it possible to save the Capitol that day I do not know to this day if we could have understood , In all the chaos and all those radar missiles.93 What plane was a flight I hope we were successful But the main thing to keep in mind is that we did not have to Because those passengers knew their plane had been hijacked And they took steps to protect us from having to do something .Which was incredibly difficult to do Those great Americans, took matters into their own hands And God bless them and their families. Every day because they are American heroes 20 years have passed since the events of September 11th It is important to stop every single year and remember the thousands who died that day , By participating in their grief , The company of Danny Levin, Acme Technologies It is currently a $ 17 billion company , A success story, to some extent Because of what his technology proved that day Danny Levin predicted that there would be a day when the world would see Internet traffic that has never been seen before F. September 11 was that day People all over the world have been trying to find information about the tragedy that took place News sites have crashed everywhere But the websites they acquired, the technology of Akmai Most of them managed to stay online that day The tragic irony in the story of Danny Levin Is that he died that day. Where everything he created was put to the test I remember that night. I went upstairs to my bedroom Barbara left a note on the pillow The note read, "I love you We'll celebrate your "" birthday when I get back on Friday It's stopping your heart. I heard from Barbara, after her death Amy was my sister I would call her my best friend She and Michael changed their schedules so they could take care of my children I had to process the guilt. I shared it with my father And he said, you are not guilty It's not related to you. It's related to the men who flew this plane If you carry it, it's like you're dead too , And you can not do it. Because we need you And I know I'm not guilty. but ...It's still It's still hard to think about Stacey spent many of her Jewish holidays with my family .Walked with us on several vacations Dad and Stacey, they were so close In fact, I would call them friends She was in the North Tower, 11 and he was on a flight So it's very comforting for me, when I go to the monument That I can stand in front of their names side by side Asia was what I call my book nerd The Math Wizard. She really liked computers So from donations we receive, from all over the world , Checks for $ 1,100, $ 11,000, $ 111 We have put the money into a scholarship fund for the last 18 years She will forever be, rooted in memories In the hearts of the people who knew her and loved her , She has a legacy Through the tragedies of September 11. Because I'm here today After September 11. Our whole world has changed .They knew that the flight deck was vulnerable The cockpit door in each aircraft was replaced with a fortified door The problem is that as soon as this door opens, you can break into this cockpit United Airlines has acknowledged this weakness So they put a device called a secondary barrier Easy gate that can be closed first. Before opening the cockpit door But in most aircraft, these obstacles are still missing To honor her late husband Victor, and prevent such tragedies Alan Sarsini is trying to persuade Congress to demand them for years Saraceni Aviation Safety Act Has now confirmed that all new aircraft will be manufactured with a secondary barrier I continue to work to force the placement of a secondary barrier , On all existing aircraft .so that all aircraft will be protected Almost 20 years have passed You have children who are now adults who were not born at this point in time , It's really important to people who can , Experienced the same day, if you have a story Talk about it with those who have no memory of it I'm just grateful for every word Brian said to me They will not be invaluable It was beautiful. It was pure love 246 people died on these planes , Twenty years later The loved ones and family members are the ones who carry the pain and loss .And these stories But we must bear, these stories as a nation As part of our history .and to protect our future Our job as a nation is to always remember : Production of an International Video Film Translation
