My name is Hélio José Muniz Filho [Junior], 21 years old My mother's name is Maria José Muniz My father is José Muniz My brothers are Ed José Muniz, Juarez Muniz, Edmar José de Santana Five men and five women Ten siblings I'm José Alexandre dos Santos de Oliveira I'm 27 years old and I'm the son of João Francisco de Oliveira and Maria José Santos de Oliveira I'm married with Fabiana Cristina de Oliveira I'm the father of Luís Vinicius Lima de Oliveira and Tiago Filipe de Oliveira My brothers are André Luís de Oliveira, José Alexandre Santos de Oliveira, Ana Emanuel and Assis Aurélio I'm the drummer of the band Faces do Subúrbio [Faces of the Suburbs] Born and raised in Camaragide I was coming from the center, in Recife I had to buy the christmas and new years clothes 5:30 in the afternoon I crossed a bridge Named Balde, that was weird and eerie as fuck On the middle of the bridge I crossed a guy, André Coveiro [Coveiro = Gravedigger] Ahead there... were two guys I knew They noticed me and I continued walking But just ahead there was a guy named Paulo Estane And he pointed a gun at me Told me to take my clothes off, I was left in underpants He took my money, I had 120.000 reais to send to my kid So he left me in underpants and I came back home desperate Six months passed I think this guy had fucked with Hélio too, he shot his brother-in-law He whipped him out Hélio told him to say the lord's prayer, the moment he said "Father", pow I had only heard of him He was also... from a poor neighbourhood A place called Detran He had done some bullshit there and then came to live in Camaragide He involved himself with some people there That were killing the criminals in town "...I got nervous, I had never killed anyone..." He got up, that boy is going out, right? Then a colleague came, I only heard the voice, but I didn't recognize who it was He came in, put on a shirt and went out I said "for the love of god, the victim is..." No, I'm going He went away A mother can tell when a son has something going on But she couldn't take it or maybe she didn't see it She didn't see it or didn't appear to I did my stuff on the streets and I didn't show it at home Got really scared, put two revolvers under the pillow and went to sleep When I checked it was 3 in the morning I told them "Is this any time to get home," "they're killing everyone out there" and they told me it happened just around the corner They told me "They didn't kill Boca, they didn't kill him" and I thought "Did he die?" "Could it be that he's alive?" So I went there to check Left for work in the morning I saw the body there That was when it blew up By mistake I told some people that... I shouldn't have told them, I was letting off steam, but I shouldn't have said it The word spread Eventually it gets to these guys It started a war They all wanted to kill me and I wanted to kill them That's when I started: I killed one, then another Ran away, my name started circulating Gang leader dead, gang fights, that stuff started turning up on the radio "Life as it is." "Cartinou, the truth-teller." "The 29th!" "A young man was found dead in the courtyard of a house in Piedade." "That man of around 25 years old is known as Didinho..." "...Resident in Rua da paz"... [Peace Street] "Cardinou Show: Who doesn't react, crawls" João Veiga Filho, special delegate of the Capital Police The information I have is... that he has killed 44 people As has been declared by local media - written, spoken and televised You have to kill not to die If I hadn't taken the lives of so many bad people, many innocent could have died I believe no one has the right to take another's life But just the idea of someone getting out the house early in the morning Spending the whole month working to get 130000 reais Just so that some motherfucker points a gun at you And takes your shoes, all your money Percussion has been here from the start, people used it to communicate And you usually always connect rhythms, to Africa, Cuba, Nicaragua, Guatemala People use it all the time Percussion is the basis of everything, like education We clean the city, we remove the wicked souls Thieves, robbers, drug dealers TV... I don't like TV much, it's not my cup of tea I see some action films, that Steven Seagal - man, there's no stopping him That guy is cool as fuck I wish I could do that, but he never dies, right? But me, I die, you know? We want to show people what goes on everyday We want to show our real life We want to be able to go to radio, to the television, and tell it like it is More people will get informed We're here to conquer the space that is ours by right It's the sound of the periphery It's music as a rescue, an awareness-raising sound That speaks the truth without mincing words Of what happens everyday in this context, the reality of the favela And few bands do this in Brazil, you can count them by the fingers But it's getting more common and I think that's the way to go It's no use glossing over what's been happening all over, including here in Pernambuco Brazillian rap was created in Pernambuco, I think Even the pioneer of the brazillian hip hop movement,. a guy called Nelson Triunfo That lives in São Paulo, is from the city of Triunfo in Pernambuco. And rap, it has the rhythmic cadence as the Embolada [brazilian genre] if you put it into the Embolada it works fine. If you do it the other way around, you can sing it normally too. "Pay attention, wicked soul..." "...we'll be telling the truth, even if you're not listening..." "...because there's so many wicked souls, we can't take it no more..." "...they're our friends on the front, but enemies on our back..." "...it's not enough that they don't help us..." "...they'll do anything to hinder us..." "...so Faces do Subúrbio doesn't turn you the other cheek..." "...and if we get hit, be assured you'll get it back..." "...so learn the message you're receiving now..." "...respect the music coming from the streets." Wicked souls... we'll clarify to you Wicked souls are those who are worthless, inutile, indigent "I'm not playing when I spit..." "...and I won't be there for the wicked souls' blight..." "...and their calculated regrets..." "...because your behaviour doesn't lead anywhere..." "...flirting with the women of your fellow man..." "...speaking ill behind your back all the time..." "...far from good deeds..." "...getting damaged for sure..." "...insisting wholly on a path of mischief..." "...you have no dignity, you're always negative..." "...no self love even, so you stay idle..." "...grow up from your bullshit, listen to what I say..." "...and I've got my eyes on your woman too." "Wicked souls, wicked souls, we can't take it anymore!" He is a wicked soul. My son, for the love of god, stop that... It's a life But they take one life, then take another, then another one steals They have to die. "Wicked souls, wicked souls, we can't take it anymore!" I don't like to use that expression because... that way of talking, "wicked soul", that's a low-life expression It's an expression used between outcasts And as an authority, I think what they mean as a "wicked soul" are people who have a lesser-than-perfect conduct, a rascal, and so on but I'm not a psychologist, neither a political scientist, nor... a person that is in the care of these people, except when I'm exercising my position in the delegation. If he thought it fit to call those people wicked souls That was his way of expressing himself But I'd never refer to the people he murdered as wicked souls, They were human beings just like the rest of us. I got the nickname of "Little Prince" because I was working as security in a bar And a guy there gave me that name because everyone liked me. I thought, "the Little Prince", that's good, right? It must come from some of his acquaintances, and I don't know any of them I'm getting to know now lots of people that come visit him that I didn't know before And I see him being very esteemed by these people, albeit his fame They really do appreciate him. People think of Camaragide as a very idle city People arrive here and they see the population still in the fairs, sitting It's a city of dorms, it has no jobs People only go there to sleep and work in Recife and other cities And so it's a rough place for opportunities, it offers no opportunities for the youth It's like a closed circuit, small businesses, only few people work there "...operating on the frequency 104,5 for the cultural development of Camaragide, Pernambuco, Brasil." "After the incarceration of Helinho [Hélio] in January of 1998... a petition was created demanding his release." "Hundreds of people signed the document that was given to the authorities." "We, the residents of these neighbourhoods, call on the authorities for the release of Hélio José Moniz..." "...a person of our trust..." "...protector of our community, which before Hélio's intervention..." "...lived tormented by robberies, vandalism and more." "After Hélio came to live in our town," "we achieved peace..." "...so the presence of this man in our community" "was 100% beneficial to our lives." "We ask then the authorities that the aforementioned be released..." "...so that he may join his community" "and free the mothers, fathers and children..." "...of the delinquency and vandalism around them." "Thus, we leave here our petition." I don't think that's right. Because people are supporting this person, who claims to be a vigilante And are undersigning a petition Giving him, as you've mentioned in your question, the description of a "good person" Do you believe that a man, that kills this amount of people, can be a "good person"? We are not living the times of Lampião [notorious brazilian bandit] Nor of António Silvino [another one] What we're seeing happen today Is lots of killers, robbers. They've forsaken god They're killing each other for fun You look at one of them, they say "What are you looking at?" And soon enough they're killing each other You must have been following the latest news Hundreds of thousands of crimes of all natures We've noticed lots of rapes recently Robberies too, which leaves us all terribly afraid Who is happy when this happens to someone of their family? You need look at this from all sides My name is Ana Clarice Almeida, I'm 25 years old And I'm a photo reporter for the Pernambuco Paper It's very odd to say this, but I like death I find the inside of the body to be very interesting It's very odd to be saying this, but I like it There isn't much way to explain it I could like taking pictures of flowers, but no ...I used to carry him to bed! I've seen mothers leaning on their sons screaming "wake up!" Holding tight to them Crying for their sons, covered in blood, dead Seeing that is a shock, really Much more than a 12mm shot to the head, this is fucked up This hurts, it's a weird feeling It makes me feel a sort of mother's love Our constitution says we are all equal in the eyes of the law Regardless of gender or race It's true that our country is big and rich But unfortunately not always are our resources well used Because of that we have grave social problem We see poverty, slums I think 80 or 90% of our population is of a disadvantaged class And because of that, since they have less access to information, They also have a harder time getting justice for themselves Because if they have no knowledge of their own rights How are they gonna look for something they don't know they're entitled to have? My name is Eduardo Trindade, I'm 26 years old. I'm a criminal defense lawyer, on the job for 2 years and a half now I think education in Brasil hasn't been a priority Education is lacking, it's the basis of everything I want to change my community, I want to change The concept of society within the people The way of thinking, the way of living The will to take the kids off the streets To spread the knowledge I've had from my suffering of... of... "Cardinou Show: Who doesn't react, crawls" "And Cardinou is just arriving to you..." "It's 11:29" "Things are looking ugly today" "Cardinou stays with you now, I'll be back tomorrow," "right after the Cardinou Show! Bye, y'all!" "I'm accompanied by José Itamar Ferreira da Silva, 53 years old..." "Miss Vera Lúcia Marques de Sousa and Paulo Roberto de Sousa." "Yesterday morning, the salesman José Itamar" "went into the town of Caruaru to make a delivery of handbags..." "When they were leaving the town," "they were detained by the military police..." ...they were stopped by the MP!" "They were accused of robbery, theft!" "They were accused of robbing a woman in a neighbouring town of Caruaru!" If they hit my wife, I'd flip out in there And my wife wasn't understanding what was going on That's when someone came and ordered her to stand up Then he told them to pull her hair to see if it was a wig Who pulled your hair? The cop. Civil or military police? Was he in uniform or painclothes? Uniform Plainclothes, it was the one that came after The one that pulled your hair and back He told me "Stand up" and I said "No problem" Okay, okay, but don't stand up here! Talk to the microphone He told me "You will suffer" and he told my husband he will too I told them I wouldn't take that treatment! You were going to get beaten! Delegate José António! "Hello Cardinou!" What a disgrace, delegate! "Complete!" Now will this case be analyzed by the internal affairs? "I don't quite believe it..." There's no way around it! The people of the delegation may start their sleepless nights! Try and sleep with a scandal such as this! It's all going to the Internal Affairs What's this business of pulling a woman's hair left and right? What a load of bullshit, is that any way for a police officer to behave? Do you know what this is about, delegate? That's because, if you didn't have your certificate of being a police delegate... You'd be locked up too! And that's because you are black and he is too! That's racism! It's because he's black! When will this stop in Brasil? People are growing up now Because of rap, conscious artists They're passing through a message and people are adhering to it Before you'd see lots of youngsters just loafing around Now you have lots of smart kids, they don't believe in everything they hear They decide not to go party on Carnival, to save the money The dumber we get, the more we lose our money There's lots of people taking advantage of each other, it's in our culture Since Africa it's been like that: people selling people Sailing them across the world for slavery So people don't trust each other, it's in our blood If I do a favour to someone, he's afraid of what I'm looking to get from them "He's giving me lots of compliments... Helping me out..." When the hand-out is too big, even a saint is skeptical - now which country's that proverb from? But it's hard The guys we're dealing with are intelligent They are the ones creating this anger, this hate, this war They create this situation For them it's all good, they're eating meat everyday It's the third year in a row this is considered the most dangerous place on earth There's lots of different neighbourhoods next to each other here in the south There where's that white house is another one, on the other side it's São Luís, and up there is Santo António And here it's Alto do Brasil... "I'm gonna spit some wisdom to my people on the other side of the wall..." "...They can never chain our thoughts..." "...Listen up people from..." [enumerating several brazilian cities] "And for all the allies spread through all the favelas in Brasil..." "...All the DJs and MCs that make rap the sound of the ghetto." "And for all the motherfuckers that wanna cut my head off..." "...Try your luck." "I believe in the word of the dark-skinned man..." "...of curly hair, that walked between beggars and leppers..." "...preaching equality." "A man named Jesus." "Only him knows when my time's come." "Peace." Sunday there's a gathering Hélio used to do these events too There's the usual game, every neighbourhood has a football field That's basically it, there's forró [music genre], lotto, football and baile funk And that's enough It's different There you can't see your friends all the time Or your family There you have no freedom of expression Out here I have the right to express myself They're citizens still They've got their hands tied, you've got rules there If you screw up, you're dead When people visit me It's like a party, everyone is happy My family, my wife, my friends It's a party that for me only happens on sunday He cries "Mother, if I had heard your advice, I wouldn't be here" He cries When I leave, he cries again There's days that I get there and he's stressed out I've been carrying some pills for him to calm down Then he gets playful and talks When it's time to say goodbye he gets... He cries, I cry too He wasn't a bad son Then I think, he was lots of work But that's how it is A mother raises their sons and you don't know how they turn out They grow up and then they change He followed that path It was weakness or evil character, I don't know Or his nerves It's a violent passion Coming to the stadium to support your team When they score a goal, it's orgasmic Y'know, we cheer for them Really dying for them to score When they do, it's just like an orgasm Lots of joy I'll share A bit of Brazil's history that's been written recently Another part of Brazil's history I usually say Brazil will still need 500 years more to turn into a nation Y'know? Because Brazil is a giant ghetto No one gets here by their own will They have to taken by force Believe it or not I'll share a passage from Brazil's history that's been written recently It was written in blood Blood of people just like you São Paulo The 1st of october Of 1992 8 o'clock in the morning "Here I am once again..." "...under the bloodthirsty gaze of the lookout..." "...you don't know what it's like to walk with an HK aiming at your head..." "...german or israelite machine-gun..." "...shreds thieves as if they're paper..." "...standing up on the wall, another good citizen..." "...serving the Estate, a good MP..." "...he starves, looking like Charles Bronson..." "...he knows what I want..." "...knows my every thought..." "...the day is cloudy, the mood is tense..." "...many tried to escape, I also want to..." "...but from 1 to 100, my odds are 0..." "...could have god heard my prayers?..." "...could the judge have heard my appeal?..." "...send a message to my brother..." "...if you're doing drugs, we ain't good..." "...he's still hanging with that chick..." "...believe me, they're fine people..." "...I took an extra day off, or one less..." "...whatever, the days are all the same..." "...I light a cigarette and watch the day go by..." "...killing time, so he doesn't kill me back..." "...a man is a man, a woman is a woman..." "...a rapist is different though, right?..." "...gets beat up all the time..." "...get on your knees and kiss my feet..." "...bleed to death on 10th St..." "...for every prisoner, a mother, a belief..." "...for every crime, a sentence..." "...every sentence, a motive, a story of tears..." "...blood, lives and glory, neglect, misery, hate..." "...suffering, contempt, disillusionment, time's passing..." "...get all that mixed together..." "...and you get another prisoner..." "...regrets on the corridor, the cell, the yard..." "...all around the place, in every corner..." "...but I know the system, my man..." "...there're no saints here..." "...ratatata..."

We went into a crack house The people that passed us Those that we saw with a cap, or a tattoo Or with those shorts We knew it We were nervous, we were angry One of hours had been killed And we knew the killer was an outsider We knew he was a wicked one That day, there were 7 of us killing him But now I'll tell you something I used to tell my brother We can't have that prejudice Just because someone has a tattoo to go and kill them We have to conscious about this! Having tattoos doesn't make you a thief Wearing a cap doesn't make you a thief I can wear it, my dad can wear it Would I kill my father because he has a tattoo? And you have to know, nowadays thieves don't have tattoos Nor do they have earrings They're getting smarter Thieves now look fancy They look better than a businessman We take Hélio for example Hélio can be saved Like Malcom X, he used to be a drug dealer, a thief A pimp, and more When he got to jail, he started reading the Quran The Sacred Bible of muslims And he turned into one of the great leaders worldwide He save the citizenship And social rights of the black community in USA Luther King always defended pacifism for human rights To grant black men the same rights of the white men The right to use a bus, the right to go to school The right to have a dignified city Health and education And Che was the strategist of the cuban revolution I got tattoos of them because they're part of world history They're part of my history If it wasn't for Che, Malcom X, Luther King I wouldn't be here standing up for my race I wouldn't be defending the rights of the brazilian proletariat Namely the proletariat of Camaragide in Pernambuco As wrong as it may be, they're a son A father, a brother I feel for them I know they must hate me I don't know, they do, don't they? Knowing that I'm his mother So they must hate me But I forgive them, because I'm a mother too I don't want anyone to kill him for what he's done They must feel the same They're mothers When I knew of any of it, I always felt bad I got sick, my pressure went up He told "you're gonna have a fever" But a mother is a mother No matter what A mother doesn't want to get those news I don't want that for you What mother does? No matter how bad it gets, it's a mother, an uncle, a nephew I never supported this I always tried to oppose him, but There was no way around it It splits me I'm a mother And I also have a big connection with god, I have faith By the law of god, those who do wrong, must pay, right? He hasn't payed anything yet All the suffering he brought But since he's young Did that under influence of others Of this world that is all about destroying The people of this world only want to destroy So god might have mercy on him May others learn a lesson with his mistakes And not repeat his actions He believed himself to be a hero Able to manage the world People managing people, it doesn't work like that You can't fix it like that God didn't fix it and he won't God is the only one in control God Bless my people God, bless everyone "Greetings to the suffering people of the north..." "...the destined people, the brave people..." "...may god bless you all..." "...tramps, beggars, precariously kept in tribulations..." "...wrong and disregarded northern people..." "...regarded as unnecessary..." "...with validated assholes mocking our accents..." "...people that face many difficulties..." "...they fight hard and even punch, and rightly so..." "...their courage and determination..." "...prolong their confidence in their strong fists..." "...calloused hands, sweat runs through worn out bodies..." "...but they don't quit and continue..."

"...in each ghetto, in each poor-stricken home," "there'll always be worries..." "...we need a dignified life, but it's impossible..." "...the poor suffer as if it were a commitment..." "...magnates work for this..." "...the more miserable we live..." "...them and their riches become invincible, I tell you..." "...they're invincible, I tell you..." "...god! Bless my people!..." "...god! Bless everyone..." "...god! Bless my people!..." "...god! Bless everyone..." If we die, someone else will come That's the problem, it never ends And it's the same everywhere Every wicked soul you kill, two or three are born On that very same spot You can't win It's a great battle Mischief starts with one but always ends with ten If I kill one, I've got to kill them all If you let two or three live and get together They'll meet others even worse They'll form a group They'll want to avenge the death of the other one that died If you had to create a place A good place to live It's like that John Lennon song, "Imagine all" Just "imagine" I think He died because of that song It's the same for us, we can't just imagine, we have to make it happen Hélio José Muniz Filho, or Helinho, was tried and sentenced to a total of 99 years in prison. In march of 2000, Helinho is in a prison in Recife, awaiting trial for other charges of homicide. Alexandre Garnizé is developing a cultural and educational project with young people in Camaragide. In march of 2000, Garnizé is working on the release of Faces do Subúrbio's second album - a group of rap in which he's the drummer.
