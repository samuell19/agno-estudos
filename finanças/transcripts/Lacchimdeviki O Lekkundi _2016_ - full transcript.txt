RBI, Reserve Bank of India It is the central banking organisation of India. It controls the monetary policy of the Indian rupee. Here, under the guidance of RBI Governor. With the chairmen and directors of all the banks in India A meeting is organised to discuss about the unclaimed accounts. Having nobody to look after Thousands of crores money are lying unclaimed in the lakhs of accounts. Those accounts are called as unclaimed accounts. Are you thinking, how can the money be lying unclaimed? If there are no transactions in the accounts for over 10 years, they would become unclaimed accounts. Banking system has begun in India 100 years ago. But the bank accounts had no proper proofs. There was nothing like Photo identity, address proof, nominee information and Know Your Customer policies. As many people died without informing their family about the money deposited in the bank accounts Those accounts were left unclaimed. But through this meeting organised here, those unclaimed accounts are to be unveiled. By using the technology They have decided to put the details of the unclaimed accounts on the bank websites. We have to see how many people would get blessings from the Goddess Lakshmi after knowing the count.

Which sir? - Our sir. Where does he stay? - If you come we will take you. If not? Sir, sir! Why did you bring me, sir? Sir! Who are you, sir? Tell me, sir. Sir, they have brought me instead of someone else by mistake. I am very useless, sir. Who are you, sir? Tell me, sir. Your account is credited Rs 1 lakh by Mahesh. There will be a procedure to claim the amount. Not this procedure. Any options? Sir, I asked you for the options. Not hundreds not thousands but crores Thousands of crores are left unclaimed in the bank Many people maintain the bank accounts secretly from their family members. Some people will have fake accounts. As such accounts were left unclosed As they die without disclosing those secret deposits to anyone Those accounts would become the unclaimed accounts. But now RBI has ordered to put the details of the unclaimed accounts in the website. Already few banks audited those unclaimed accounts which they have And kept them on their websites. But among the very few banks which did not keep them on the websites Janata Bank in which you work is one. That is why I targeted you. After getting the details of those unclaimed accounts Selecting few accounts among them By faking the documents stating we are the heirs to the money, We can rob that money. So I want the data file of the unclaimed accounts in your bank. You have to bring that. Thank you boss. I will bring how many ever files you want, boss. Not the files which you think. Computer data files. In the bank, only two people have the access to that. One is the manager and the other is Devi. What is this boss. You said good news but immediately gave me a twist. He is like a messenger of god and she will worship the bank as a temple. I will give you the share of 5 percent. Give me another 5 percent, boss. You will get the file. 10 percent, Okay. - Deal, deal okay. - Deal. Will he bring? He alone can bring. How to open this? What are you doing? What work do you have here? As the time for customers is over, I thought to help Devi, sir. Is it? Wait. Devi, Naveen is free without work it seems. He is eager to do work. He wanted to help you it seems. If he is so free, ask him to take out the complaints from the complaint box and file them. That is right too. You heard it? Go and do that work. That complaint box.. Tell me. - Brother, what you said is correct. If the finger print of either Devi or Manager is not scanned on the device It is impossible to open the data room. But you do not worry, brother. I will follow Devi seriously, I will get it done. - Okay. My percentage Can he not hear me completely? Why are you not answering my call from three days? Where did you go? - She does not have time sense at all. She has come. He might not have got up still. One second one second. I will open it. I will open it. One second. Please. Why did he change his route? Devi! - Go! - Devi! I think your connection is temporarily disconnected. Why? Are you looking to get connected permanently? We can think of connecting later, come sit on the bike first. What is the matter? Recently, all out friends went to the restaurant together. As she has no friends, I thought of introducing my friends and asked her to come there. There we have clicked a few photos. I posted one of them on the Face book. - So? For that photo, many people commented on me more than on her. What else? She felt jealous and unfriended me. - Oh my god! The days have gone where they complain on the comments Now they are feeling sad that they do not get comments. Oh Lord! Go and talk. All the best. Sorry, Devi. I did not expect that you would be so hurt. Devi, please try to understand. This situation looks favourable for me. Yes! Pooja madam, you do not worry. I will offer you the lift daily. It is not about the lift. You want your friendship to be connected again? Leave it for me. - What will you do? We have to remove the thorn with a thorn. We can also remove it using a pin, right? We can also remove it using the mobile. Thorn? - No, still. Give me your mobile once. Sweety Devi Cutie Devi Naughty Devi hottie Devi Selfie Devi sexy Devi Vixy Devi Devi Devi Pooja Pooja!

May I come in, sir? - Come Come in. What? Sir has forgot the signature. - Take it. Thank you, sir. - You wait. I have some work with you. A small request. - Tell me. For our bank which has protected your account so safely You too should do a small favour. You wanted me to invest in the bonds. - Yes. Sorry, sir. That is the money of my grandmother. I would like to donate it to a good trust in her name. Oh, that is nice. Very good.. Very good! Okay, did you ever see your grandmother? My grandmother was not alive by the time when I born. So, I do not know more about her. - That is it, right It is okay if you are not aware then. But as you came to claim her account, you have to know it now. Several years ago, an elderly man came to open the account in our bank. I thought it was on his name. But he said No on my name, but on the name Ankalamma. I asked who is she? Then he said It did not rain sufficiently in their place for a long time it seems. Then they vowed to the village goddess whom they worship. With her blessings, as it rained sufficiently Their crops got high yield. After a few days, they built a temple for that goddess it seems. The Hundi at the temple was filled with the gifts offered by the devotees. Then that elderly man, with the fear that someone may rob that Hundi He opened the account in the name of that goddess in our bank And deposited the whole amount in our bank. Ankalamma is the name of that goddesss, man. Now, tell me. Is Ankalamma your grandmother? Devi, call Ms Jyoti. Sir, shall we talk personally? - No talking, nothing to talk. Sir, I will go. - Where will you go? You heard about the Penna river dam Will not you hear about the Somasila floodgate? May I come in, sir? Welcome! Come in. Oh my god! Looking at you, I feel like seeing Umadevi madam. The way of wearing sari, bindi and that royalty Thank you, sir. - Very happy, baby. At least now you came to settle the account of Umadevi. By the by, meet Mr Mahesh. Same to same as your case. A small request. You would ask me to invest the money in your bank, is that it? I would like to start an old age home in the name of my grandmother and do service. That is nice. Very good.. Very good! Exactly even sir has the same thought. Did you ever see your grandmother? She died at my childhood itself. So you do not know anything about her. It is okay even if you do not see her You have to know a little about her. - Tell me. Your grandmother Umadevi was the only successor of Rao Bahadur Rangarao. He nurtured her with utmost care as she has no mother. He never said no to whatever she asked. Umadevi who reached her young age said her father about her love towards a musician. Even Rangarao agreed for that. He did not like to marry Umadevi who did not know even the basics of music Said that musician directly. As he was unable to perform the marriage of his daughter and did fulfil her wish Rangarao died in that pain. But Umadevi did kept quite. With the determination, she started to learn music. But will that musician keep quite? How much time will he wait? He married another girl. Unable to digest this, Umadevi committed suicide and died. The rumour is that even now the soul of Umadevi is moving somewhere practising music. How did Umadevi who died without getting married give birth a son? And when were you born to him? He is the grandson of Goddess Ankalamma She is the granddaughter of unmarried Umadevi who is roaming as a soul. Goddess Lakshmi Who could guess what will happen every minute? Sir! I want to talk to you, sir. Sir I want to talk to you, sir. Please reduce the volume, sir. Okay, tell me. Now tell me. What is your personal thing? It is about the honour of our bank, sir. I will have to talk to our manager once. - Okay, call him. What, man? Are they getting bashed up in the cell? When you are in our bank which has been completed 100 years without any remark If anyone knows that someone tried to do a fraud, is it not a disreputaion sir! Who will receive this direputation, sir? - Who? It is us, right? If the press comes to know about this, what happens to the reputation of our bank, sir? I will talk with SI once, give him the phone. Manager is on call. Tell me, sir. - This is the matter of a bank. If this reach the media, not only we All our customers will also get into the trouble. We will take care not to repeat such an incident once again For this time, give them a warning and leave. Okay, sir. Take care of us too. Our person will take care, sir. Okay, brother. If I see you either in this city or state, I will bash you up in the cell. Are you playing a drama? What, boss? I just played a trick on the police and saved you from them Why are you holding my shirt? - Not the shirt, but I should hold your neck. Yes, you would.. both planning and execution are yours. But you blame me! Leave me. I salute you and your operation. Do not meet me again. Do not even call me. It is better for you both if you shift from here as soon as possible. Good bye! Naveen, what happened? - What happened? An unexpected problem occured in our bank family. If the problem becomes public, we will be on the footpath. Using my talent and dealing privately with the police I solved that problem. You keep quiet. Got it? There are some people, but why? They will not work other than worshipping. One has to work like you. I am very proud of you, dude. Okay, I will meet the manager and come. - Okay. Hey, everything is okay, right? - 100 percent okay, sir. They will not even look at our bank from now. Can I believe you 100 percent? Sir, why did you come here at this time? Nothing, I thought to see you and came here. Okay, can I believe you 100 percent? Sir, about what you are - You do not think of anything now. I will tell you an idea with which you can get them both. What both, sir? - One is Devi Second one is the money which you get if you give the data. Data? What data, sir? I got the doubt when you followed Devi. It was confirmed when you were moving near the data room. Then I fixed a camera in the data room and connected it to my mobile. I saw your entire movie. Sir, one gang trapped me. But she is believing me heartfully. I cannot lose that trust, sir. So I have decided not to give that data, sir. No, you have to give the data to them. I cannot cheat Devi, sir. - Already you cheated her. If you do not give the data, then you will be the one who ruins the life of Devi. Okay, what do you want me to do? You have the pen drive, right Give this pen drive instead of that pen drive. The further story will keep on going automatically. I will do as you said only if you say that there will be no problem to Devi. The problem occurs only if you do not do as I said, right How perfectly you managed, man! But you narrated the fake stories and scared them well, sir. They are not the fake stories but are real. - Yes, real! Now the main story begins. Here, the cheques prepared on their names. Take my car and meet the bank manager of Kukatpalli. He will give you the cash, bring it. What? How can we share it, sir? - You tell me. As we are only two, Goddess account is for you and ghost account is for me. We will do as you said. You go and bring the cash. Go. What again? Sir, Devi will come to know if the amount gets clear from the accounts. Oh! Devi, come to my cabin. Yes, sir. Devi, from now, only I will deal with that unclaimed accounts section. Sir, but - I saw the thing you did, right The documents were perfect, sir. The one who did the scam planned it more perfectly than you. You made her cry, sir Just tears, right? Wipe them with currency notes. They will vanish, you go. Why are you here? Sorry, I came to the wrong address. - You came to the right address, come. Come inside. Come, keep it there. Sit down. Why are you with them, sir? They are the gamblers, sir. - Is it? They asked me to bring Rs 50,000 to the club and grabbed Rs 1 lakh from me. Okay. Cheating the innocents like me They opened the locker in our bank to hide all the money, sir. It was me who made open that. Do you know where the money which is being used for rotation in that club has come It is from our bank. The way how I used you to bring out the money which was kept unclaimed To put that inside, I used these two. I no need of all these. If you give my share, I will go. Share? Dear, share it seems. What, baby? Do not you like it.? Why are you doing like that? Are you saying no? She likes only receiving but does not want to give even a single not it seems. You are not very aged, right? You are a young boy. You can do such things so many. Now you go. Sir - Go! Think of it once. - I said go, right? Go. This is injustice, sir. - That is it. So what? You will get a rotten death, sir. God will never forgive you, sir. Sir.. sir! Why are you going, sir? Have you forgotten that today is Monday? - Shivoham Worshipped Lord Shiva and brought this Vibuthi. No evil eye will fall on our bank. Go. Please come. They hide the money in the bank again after robbing it from the bank. But they cheated me. Why is it burning? Why is it appearing again? Devi, come to my room. Sir, you called me What is this? Vibuthi has turned red and it is burning. Vibuthi How can Vibuthi turn red? - That is what I am asking, right? Devi! Why the smoke is coming? Where is your face? Only the hair is visible. Not devi Goddess Where? Why are you coming close? Do not look at me like that. Hey! It is me, baby. Your bank manager. When one's destruction time arrives, one has extreme thoughts. That is why Vibuthi turned red. Ankalamma wishes for your blood. Ankalamma? Who is Ankalamma? Who is Ankalamma How could you lift it like that? You took the donations which were offered by my devotees after their wish gets fulfilled And do not you remember me? Goddess Ankalamma! Salutations, goddess. I remember, goddess. If I step on you, you will vomit the blood and die. I mad a mistake because of greedy, goddess. I will do whatever you ask me to do. Why are you moving like that? Oh, no! Why did you fall down? I think the goddess has left her. Devi.. Devi! What happened, sir? The face turned back and the hair came front side Then hair went back and the face came front side. I think you felt giddy. Even for me. Why, sir? Why Vibuthi turned red? I kept kumkum on Vibuthi, Ankalamma. - Ankalamma? That is I am saying that I kept the kumkum of Ankalamma. Do not know, sir You are very disturbed since the time of Ankalamma account issue. Tomorrow is Tuesday, right - Yes. I will go to Hanuman temple, perform pooja in your name and bring the Sindhoor. What is he? Naveen, come to my room immediately. Come, sit. What is this appearance, sir? Devi is a goddess. - I know. How do you know? Goddess of my love. Not the Goddess of love. Goddess of the village. Devi has been possessed by Goddess Ankalamma. She lifted such a big sofa up to this height. She would have lifted me and thrown away after a while. She came to know that we took the money. Now we but you. - Yes, it is me. Said that she would see my end. - She should have done it already. She postponed it unnecessarily. Why are you so angry with me? - Or else what, sir? You said two stories to take away money. Another story to skip my share? My boy, the account of ghost is yours. But you follow that Devi correctly and find the actual matter. I will do it, but you will not narrate a new story, right? - I will not say. The account of ghost is yours. So expensive? There he is selling at a very low price. These are fresh. - They are not very fresh. But you are telling more - Hi, Devi. I will take if you give me for Rs 10. - No, these are of first-class quality. You will say first class quality 100 percent guarantee We cannot know how many damages will be there unless we cut. Please come.. fresh vegetables. Come, madam. How much are these? - One kilo for Rs 40, madam. It is too much. - what do you want, Devi? What about that? - 250 grams for Rs 20. Shall I bargain? - No. Not only them, you can manage everything. What happened now? Do not talk. I should not believe even 1 percent. Me? - Yes, you. Is there anyone who says positively about you in the bank? Waste fellow! What happened? She hated me that there is nobody who says positively about me in the bank. Did she say that? - Yes. Hey, where are you going? She said it is enough if one person says it, right? That one is me, I will say it and come. At this time? Now? - This is the right time to say about you. I am going. - Hey - Wait. I will set it. Correct! Devi.. Devi! Devi! Oh, the door is open. Devi..

Why are you calling me Devi always. You can call me Uma, right? Uma? - Yes. You want my account but What is wrong in calling me Uma? Are you Umadevi? It has happened as manager said. Anyway, I do not have any connection with your bank account. What are you doing, Devi? You will destroy the makeup. That is why I am fastening your hands. Why are you fastening my hands? Devi! No Umadevi! - Do not move. There is no connection between your account and me. My manager has stolen everything. Where did she go? Shall I sing a song? - Song? Vashigolisova Vasoligoshiva Hello! - Sir, it is me Naveen. Why did you call me at this time? Devi is not a goddess but a devil, sir. - Devil? Umadevi, sir. Had you a glance in that disguise? - Yes. Here I am scared of her, but you are laughing! - What should I do instead of laughing? You said Devi is a goddess. I want the account of the ghost. Did she give you nicely? Are you satisfied? I do not want any goddess account and ghost account. You have to save me from this. If not I will say that you did everything. Do not do that. I was unable to tolerate just one avatar. Do I need another? I cannot - If she comes to me again then it is up to you. Can I escape from that? You do not reveal everything in fear. I will manage it. - Okay. Baby Devi! - What, sir? Today is my birthday. You have to come for lunch with me. Okay Happy birthday, sir. - Thank you! Why me for lunch, sir? When your father and mother were alive, we three used to go.

As you said, I asked her to place the order. Did you see how many items she ordered. She is very normal. - You are not understanding. You no need to worry. How am I booked this way? What will this mad girl do now? Mummy.. mummy! Why did you come here leaving her there? You came leaving me there, right? She did not order for herself. She may eat me up. Are you talking about that girl? - Yes. You are wrong. She is perfectly normal. Who is he? - He is a very famous psychiatrist. He will get rid of the ghost which possessed Devi. I understood one thing. - What? Both of you have Paranoid phobia. Sir, I did not ask you to say about our diseases but the disorder of that girl. That girl has nothing. She is very very normal. That is it - Come on. Sir, did you finish your handwash also? You ate very fast. Sorry, sir. I am very slow at eating. Wait, I am done. I will wash my hand and come. She said that all the items were ordered for us She ordered 10 plates, she ate everything without leaving a single piece. What, doctor? - Oh my god! She is thinking that you too ate along with her and went for handwash. No doubt, this is a case of multiple disorders. You have to do whatever she asks. If not life will fall into danger. Take care. - Okay. She will eat me too if I stay here. Bye! - Doctor What there to, sir? - What is there to do? We have to make a restaurant available always. Or else she would sprinkle salt and pepper on you and me She will suck our blood. You will be fine as you are young. But I will be tasteless. Sir, shall we go? - Okay. Who do you think I am man? Who do you think, man Who do you think I am? I am Ankamma Ankalamma I am Ankala Parameswari You bloody fellow If you plan to steal the money of mother of all the goddesses If you plan to take away everything which was given to me by so many devotees If you are taking the gifts vowed during struggles and offerings in front of me Do you think that I will just see silently You bloody fellow Where were you all these days Are you here, Julu - Julu? My Julu My Yajulu My dearest Somayajulu Fulfill my wishes Taking all my wealth Why are you behaving like you do not know anything For you, I wore the diamond bangles and kept jasmine flowers in my hair I wore the diamond bangles and kept jasmine flowers in my hair For me? I will drink your blood and chew your meat I will break your bones I will tear your ribs I will wrap you up and swallow you in one gulp, you bloody fellow Goddess Ankalamma! Did you go again? I cannot tolerate this confusion, goddess. Stop this guest appearance like the ghost Finally, tell me what do you want me to do. Put all the money which you have stolen in my Hundi. - Okay, goddess. I will put. Then what about my money? - What is this? Tone has changed and also the place. Umadevi, is that you? Tell me, where should I get that. Where will you give? Why did she start again? Put the money of Umadevi also in my hundi. - Okay, goddess Okay. I am accepting my mistake and I will put all the money in your hundi. Hi, Devi! I did not expect that you would get caught so easily. Jyoti, concept is super. Mr Mahesh, direction was fantastic. But Ms Devi, you are the super actor. Is that success? That is surprise as it is success, right. Devi, thank you so much. You made it. It is my duty to help the bank. But what you are doing is a big help to the society. Our meeting and this journey is very interesting. Mahesh.. Mahesh! Oh, shit! Go go fast. - Jyoti! I want to talk to you. Tell me how you got the data. Naveen Devi! - Yes. Oh! Sorry, Devi. Park it and come. - No, I have some work outside. You go. It is enough if you fill that form and sign on it. Okay. Thank you. We have to tell you one thing. - What? As you thought, we are not committing any fraud. We are journalists. The unclaimed accounts which were left in the bank for years have been misused. To prove that, we started this operation. If we have withdrawn the money as planned By arranging the press meet We thought to expose the bank employees involvement and the fraud happening in the bank to the public. You would have told the truth when you got caught. Nobody could have believed if we said so. And they would have thought that we both are planning something to escape. Very wisely your manager trapped us and he has withdrawn that money. Is that why he removed me from the data section? If required you check your data Our both accounts were closed. If you do this help, we can expose the fraud that has happened. And the remark made on us can be cleared. Mainly, we can make that unclaimed accounts issue public. Okay. I am with you. I did not expect that the manager will get caught so easily. It is the power of Devi. According to our plan.. The manager will come to the temple tomorrow at 12:12 pm and put the money in hundi. He said that he will accept his mistakes in front of the goddess. Everything will be recorded in the cameras which we have set there It will be live telecast on TV, web and mobiles. So unclaimed accounts issue will be highlighted. One request from me. We have to book Naveen by saying that he committed so many mistakes. Okay, then Giving you the update for every minute, I will follow the manager and come. How if you come? I mean As it is a live telecast, the police will come to the bank immediately. So you should be there and fix Naveen - Correct. - Yes. Then only I will get satisfied. - All the best, Devi. - Okay. Update everything from time to time. - Okay. Jyo! - Yes. Book two tickets to Dubai immediately. Razak Bhai! I am sending 3 crores. That should be delivered in Dubai. Mata! Bless me, goddess. Mata Sharanam Sharanam Mata Sir! - Not sir Mata Mata? - Yes, Mata. This is the Ankalamma Maala. All our problems will get solved by today, Mata. The goddess appeared in my dream and said that If we put all the money which was stolen from her in Hundi She will forgive and leave us, Mata. Then what about me? - She said that also. Umadevi who is torturing you is the devotee of that goddess it seems. So she said if we put even that money in hundi, she will also forgive you, Mata. Then, will you give it? - You do not worry, Mata. I took this oath to end up this, right? Mata! - Sir Mata, I took the oath. Everything will happen as you thought. About what, sir? - It is that that. Mahesh, they have come. Mr Mahesh! They have come. - Okay. Where are you? - I am at the temple. Okay Okay. Mata.. mata.. mata Mahesh, some thieves have entered the bank. How can the thieves enter? Mr Mahesh, some robbers entered the bank. I know.. I know. - How do you know? Oh god! Did you find the time only today to do the robbery? Sir Police sir! Police? - Police? Sir! - How come you are here? Here I am doing the job, sir. - Sir! - You too? Are you both working here? - Yes, sir. How come you are here? As your manager requested me, I came on a mock drill to this bank. - Okay, sir. If some thieves attack suddenly Hey, what? - Nothing, sir. Disturbing in between. Be there. Where am I? - Thieves, sir Thieves Mock drill is to educate the customers and staff how to react when some thieves attack suddenly. Oh! Mata.. mata.. mata Mahesh Mahesh! Why are you holding me? Leave me. Sir, the thieves have entered the Janata Bank main branch. Come immediately, sir. Jyoti! Where is the suitcase? Hey, bring him here. What? What is this, man? You came selecting a bad time Did you find the time only today to do your duty? Do you know at whom you are pointing the gun? At a goddess, man. Where? Ask your goddess to come. Ask your goddess to come. Why are you staring silently still? Come at least to save your money, goddess. Come! Will you come and torture me if I am alone? Will not you come if there are so many? Goddess might not come from this Devi But to save her money, that goddess will come. I will make her come. Come dear Mahalakshmi Come here Come dear Mahalakshmi Come here You can cleanse the sins in our bank and go You can cleanse the sins in our bank and go, queen of money Come dear Mahalakshmi Come here Will the goddess come if I call her so softly?

I will give you arti. Sri Lakshmi, Dhilakshmi, Bhulakshmi, Golakshmi - Shut up! Did I come to the bank or to a mental hospital? You came to the bank, Mata. Then, where is the locker room? - Lockers are there. But your money is outside. - Outside? Go, Mata. Burn those convicts with this and take away your money. Take your positions. - Oh, police Jyoti, come on move. Come on! Sir, I am the one who called you about the thieves entering the bank. Okay. Hey, take them away. You want a light for your face! Did you start the robbery in the banks leaving the ATMs? From where did you start digging? - Charminar. Are you single? Or is there anyone else? Only pigs come as a group, lion comes all alone No multi-star, only single star. That is this Burning Star! Are you injured severely? - Yes. - Oh, no It will heal very soon. - Okay. Is it paining? - Yes. Enough blowing at that, you can do it later. Do not know where the money of the goddess has gone during the fight, boy. Sir, I have concealed that carefully. - Concealed? - Yes, sir. Where? - There, sir. Come. Baby, you too come. My dearest Mata! This year, you are the best employee of the year. - Thank you, sir. I have to go to the temple immediately and put this money in hundi. Goddess Lakshmi has a count, right? Money rained at Jubilee Hills Road No. 36 In the accident took place at Peddamma Temple, Jubilee Hills Water tanker hits the car which has been driven by Somayajulu, manager of Janata Bank. Crores of rupees spilt out of the car Identified as the money that belongs to the unclaimed accounts scam. While the old criminals Mahesh and Jyoti who planned this scam tried to escape by threatening with weapons Encounter specialist Brahmaji chased them and arrested them at Charminar area. Cannot you stay without smoking? Here I have many doubts about the incident happened in the bank. Everything was like a miracle. Why did Mahesh and Jyoti who were supposed to be at the temple come to the bank? Mock drill officer has come correctly at that time. That thief is another one in the climax. You know everything, right? - Yes. I saw you going to Mahesh. What the work she has outside during bank working hours? I heard everything what you discussed. You will not understand whatever I say at that time. I have set the mock drill officer to arrive. Hello, it is me the manager of Janata Bank Somayajulu speaking. You have to come to our bank and conduct a mock drill. As your manager requested me, I came on a mock drill to this bank. Then what about that thief? I do not know who he is.
