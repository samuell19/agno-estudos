Shirley, I-I can't understand this... You behaved as if you've never had a single day's scientific training in your life! A two-year-old could do better! Man: Uh, professor Caldwell -- I presume you would like to know the results of our examination. Yes, professor Morris. Disposition: Moody. And listless. Professor: Moody and listless. Behavior: Obstinate. And independent. I would say yes -- obstinate and independent. I'm sure you gentlemen will revise your opinions at the next examination. I have no explanation for her behavior today, but I just feel that -- "feel"? Ha! Only a woman would oppose unalterable scientific facts with...intuition. Yes. Shirley, it's time to go! Shirley's never behaved as badly before. Compared to her dullness, that cow's a mental wonder! Maybe being neighbors with valenti ain't so good -- I think I ought to change Shirley's stall. Perhaps a change would help -- some mountain air and a romp down on the farm might be just the thing. Mortimer, we're taking Shirley back home. But Shirley's college property now -- if professor Morris finds out, there'll be a heap of trouble. And I'm liable to lose my position if I don't find out the reason for Shirley's conduct. Take the noon train and have Cindy meet me at the depot tomorrow. Maybe it ain't such a bad idea... I ain't seen Cindy for quite a spell. That's right. See you on the farm. Seems like both you and miss Jane have been kinda out of sorts lately... There's gonna be trouble with this... But I'll see Cindy...

Well, they're paying good money just to take some pictures of the farm -- that ain't no reason for miss Jane to get angry. Don't need no reason, the way she's been feeling lately. You shouldn't'a rented the farm to those movin' picture folks, not without askin'. Don't you side with pappy. Start this thing! Might help if you'd turn on the ignition. Oh, that![ Engine starts ] Seems like females is just... Well, females. Mules or women -- they're always in a tizzy! Ain't a single reason why Shirley won't drink, but she won't. "Shirley" -- why, any self-respecting mule would die of shame before she'd let anyone call her Shirley! In my days, mules didn't go traipsin' up and down to college and such, no sir![ Brays ] Sounds exactly like one of them thievin' mccoys! If I thought she was, I'd bust her wide open! Oh, pappy, put yer rifle down. Shirley's kinda touchy. Hmph. Might hurt her feelings. Stop sloshin' that water around! Makes me thirsty.. By thunder, I amthirsty. Your office is in the trailer, Mr. Burton. The phone's been connected. Thanks. Where would I find Mr. Dunning? I think he's in miss Baxter's dressing room. This is perfect -- much better than anything we could have built at the studio. It sure is -- it's the real McCoy. Pappy: McCoy!!! I'll blast the first McCoy that shows his face around here! Hold it, pappy -- there's no McCoy around here. This is our producer, Mr. Burton. Burton, huh? Not from the chattahoochi- platte burtons?! I'd just as soon shoot one of them as a McCoy! No! I'm strictly a sunset strip Burton. From out californee way. Probably shoulda let him have one blast anyway. Woman: Such delicacy! It's bad enough doing the part, but this scene! My dear Gloria, the true artist can rise above her role, ifshe but possesses the divine madness. Madness my eye -- I wasn't born yesterday. True, but with proper makeup, I think we can effectively conceal that from the camera. Sure, boss, that #37 pancake would hide the wrinkles on an elephant! Wrinkles?! My darling, I'm so glad you've finallyarrived. From outside it sounded like a Hollywood conference. What's the trouble? Your star has taken exception to the dramatic scene -- it doesn't do her justice. It most certainly doesn't! Just read this. Up to the part about the mule! There's another thing -- here we are in Missouri, the capital of the mules -- do I have a mule? No! Anything wrong, Sam? None of 'em have had the body, the look, or the voice. But I'm expecting another bunch any minute now. "Bunch"? Am I going to direct bananas?! I want a mule! Tony's right, Sam, the gimmick in the story is the mule -- get him what he wants. My darling, we were discussing my scene. Don't you worry, I'll get it fixed up for you. Thank you, darling, I knew you would. Here come the new mules! Probably another lot of scrawny imitations. Shall we have a look? Oh, Mike... I'll be right with you, Sam. Mike, darling, you don't seem a bit glad to see me. Of course I am, but I only just arrived. I haven't even had time to clean up. I've got to fix that scene for you, you know. All right -- you can read it to me in your office later. That'll be fine, I'll see that thorny's there, too. Too long! Too short! You call that a tail? The ozark terror -- with this one, I could do a horror picture. You expect me to get a performance out of these? Losethem. Sorry, bub -- the voice won't record. See what I mean, Mike? Don't worry, well pick one up. "Pick one up"? Can one "pick up" a Lillian Russell?! I can see the symmetry of her legs, the delicacy of her ankles, the grace of her every step, the ripple of her -- of course, I don't know nothin' about no ripples, but if it's a mule you're lookin' for, there's one out there in that there b-b-b-barn. Direct from college -- got a diploma, too. Mortimer here takes care of her. That might be it, thorny. Iam interested. Well, you can see her, but the boss won't be home for a spell. More than likely wouldn't let you use her, anyway. Sourest disposition this side of the ozarks. The mule's, too. Shirley's been kinda poorly of late. That's why professor Caldwell brought her down to the farm. Shirley's been hand-raised -- scientific. "Shirley"... A name of the aroma of appleblossoms in springtime. Take a look -- if you want her, I'll see the owner. Pappy'll show her to you -- I'll get her some turnips. Oh, you better be kinda careful... She's a little fussy around strangers. Sounds like that mule's particular. A sign of artistic temperament, the true Mark of the thespian. We shall approach Shirley with the dignity and discretion befitting her stature.

[ Construction noises ] I'm sorry, miss Jane, I just reckoned it wouldn't harm the place none. I know you thought you were doing right, but -- ♪ [ big band music blares] ♪ All this noise is impossible! I'll never get any work done! Oh, uh... Miss Baxter's -- "to Mortimer. Affectionately, Gloria." "Affectionately"! Where can I find the man in charge? That's Mr. Burton, he's over in the trailer. Cindy, ain't nothin' to that picture! I'll make sure of that! [ Knocking ] Come back later, I'm busy. All right, what it is? If you'll put some clothes on, I could discuss my business properly. Oh, I'm sorry. Pardon me. Business? Discuss what business? This motion picture business. I came down here with my mule -- mule? You'll have to see Mr. Dunning, our director. I was told you were in charge of this company. I am, but i'mnot hiring the mule -- I know, Mr. Dunning is hiring the mule. Right, and he may already have one. Belonging to the owner of this farm. Well, that takes care of Mr. Dunning. Now, if you'll permit me to finish, I -- whose mule?! Professor Caldwell's mule. If that's all settled, perhaps you'll leave and I can forget about yourmule. That's an excellent idea. And as for leaving, youcan start immediately. You happen to be using myproperty. Now, see here, I -- yourproperty? But I -- you'renot professor Caldwell? I am, and I'll expect you to be gone no later than tomorrow. Yes, but I --[ Telephone rings ] Just a minute, will you, please? Hello? Oh, hello, j.O. -- Snapshots? Oh, locations. Glad you liked them. Hold it -- I want to talk to you. No, I don't want to talk to you,j.O. I mean, of course I want to talk to you! Can't we talk this thing over? I simply must have the use of my farm. But we won't hurt the farm -- what's that? Oh, certainly, j.O., we'll use the farm. You certainly will not! If you're here tomorrow afternoon, I'll have you arrested for trespassing. But we can't move, it would delay the shooting schedule. What's that? Certainly, we'll come in on schedule, don't worry about a thing. Okay, goodbye. Professor... Miss Caldwell. Can't we straighten this thing out? I'm sorry, my experiments can't be disturbed. You'll have to find some other place. She's a gorgeousanimal, just the type! Are you listening, Mike? That lady you just passed outside is its owner. The mule? Did we get it? She ordered US to moveby tomorrow. But it's a perfect location! She can't do this to me!! This is no time for dramatics, thorny. I've got to think. Think?! What is there to think about? She's a woman, is she not? She is not. Professor Caldwell is a scientist. Oh, I see. We have brains to deal with, eh? Yes. A scientist... Thorndyke, I am about to become... Temperamental. We've got a bit of scientific reading to do. [ Knocking ] Come in. Good evening, miss Caldwell. I realized that we'd be disturbing your work here, so I've ordered my company to pack up. If you'll just sign this release to the effect that we haven't caused any damages. On the bottom line, please. Anything wrong? No, no -- won't you sit down? Mr., ah... Mr. Burton. No thanks, I'm much too nervous. Aren't you going to sign it? Yes... Yes, of course. But this happens to be a confidential report from a psychiatrist. Oh, did I give you that? I'm terribly sorry, I didn't mean to waste your time. On the contrary, it's quite interesting. I'm a scientist, you know. Yes. Tell me, Mr. Burton, in view of this, you're undoubtedly a victim of gastroepiploic sinistra. Well, I -- huh? Oh, yes! Of course!Of course. What usually happens when you get these attacks? Well, it's very disturbing, you see, it sort of flips, and then it flops. You see? Flip. Flop. Oh... When it flips or flops, does it hurt? Hurt? Sometimes it almost kills me! Mine is one of the rarest cases on record! I remember reading of a similar case. The patient occasionally would lose his equilibrium and fall to the floor. Fall to the floor? Flat on his face. Oh, yes, of course, that happens to me quite frequently. I never know when it's gonna hit. [ Groans ] Oh... The poor man -- it'll be hours before the attack subsides. [ Moans ] Ha ha! What's so funny? You, Mr. Burton. For your information, we're allvictims of gastroepiploic sinistra. It's an artery in the stomach, not a disease. Oh, is it? Ha ha ha! Pardon me while I brush the hayseeds out of my hair. I was under the impression there was straw in yours. Any chance of you changing your mind about our staying here? You know, for one of the rarest cases on record? Well, that should merit consideration... All right. You can use the farm. Thanks, miss Caldwell. Remarkable how rapidly I've recovered, isn't it? Thanks again. Come visit US on the set. Good night, miss Caldwell. Good night. [ Sighs ] A gal could do much worse -- he sure is a good lookin' fella! Yes, isn't he! Don't be a silly goose. I've no time for such nonsense.

You pulled a fast one and she fell for it. Not exactly. Idid the falling. Oh, you became quite friendly? I got the location, didn't I? A meritorious achievement -- but what about my mule? She's experimenting with that mule, I was afraid she'd turn me down. But I have an idea how we can get it. After last night, nothing should be toodifficult. Much to my regret, I feel inclined to agree with, uh... Our star. You must have made someprogress with her. We didpart on friendly terms -- that's why I hate to do this. Mike, this is no time to let a mere friendship come between me and that mule! We've got a picture to make! I guess you're right. Well, this is the idea -- I've invited her to come and watch US work. When she gets there, we'll pretend to discuss the impossibility of the mule acting on cue. She sticks her nose in and we get the mule? Right. Why all the strategy? She's only a little hick. Gloria, did you ever have gastroepiploic sinistra? Gastro-what? You get it by thinking you're smarter than that little hick. Good luck on your first day's shooting, anyway. Thanks, old boy, I'll need it. With this outstandingcast, I don't know whether to use a camera or a gun. I guess you must be from the flatlands. I ain't got much use for valley folks. That's swell stuff, fella, but... You're wearing that beard wrong. What the Sam hill are you talking about?! I've always wore my beard this way!

Why, it's the McCoy! McCoy?! If there's a McCoy around here, let him come out a-shootin'! She's coming, Mr. Burton. Thank you. This is impossible! What am I, an animal trainer? The writer must have been demented. No mule can do the things that this script calls for. Well, I -- oh, good morning, miss Caldwell. This is Gloria Baxter, our star, and thorndyke dunning, our director. How do you do? Did I interrupt you? No, not at all. The writer of this script has done all the interrupting. As a matter of fact, he hasn't stopped. It's absurd -- asking a mule to waltz! And lie down and sit down on cue! Some of my actors can't even do that. We'll have to cut out the part about the mule. They're stubborn, anyway. They are not! My mule Shirley's intelligence almost equals that of a human. You mean your mule would roll over and sit up? Easily, and more. ThatI've got to see. [ Whistles ] It worked. I didn't think she'd fall so easily. This is Shirley. Well, she might do. Sit down, Shirley. Pleasesit down? Sit down! She won't work that way.

A complete understatement -- she's sensational! Yes, boss. Under my direction, you will positively achieve stardom. Your name will be in lights! [ Snorts ] Ah, you understand. Wait here while I go and try to make the actors understand. Ifthat is possible. You've done a great job with Shirley, miss Caldwell. It wasn't difficult. Shirley, like all other animals, responds to affection and intelligent treatment. Miss Caldwell probably spends all her time in the mule's company. Why, yes. You see, Shirley's always a perfect lady. Really. Well, I, uh, must change. See you later, darling. Don't pay any attention to Gloria, she's the eternal actress. But I think Shirley's going to give her some competition. Wait till we start her publicity campaign. No, Mr. Burton. You may use Shirley, but no publicity. But why not? She's perfect copy. In a scientific journal, yes, but on a theatrical page, no. Midlands college of agriculture has a name for it -- unethical exhibitionism. Very well, miss Caldwell. You have my word -- no publicity as far as Shirley's concerned. Yes, j.O., the mule's a natural born actress! Sensational! No, j.O., I haven't had a chance to talk to Mr. Burton about publicity. He's busy on the set. You're right, j.O., she oughta make wonderful copy. Okay, j.O. No, I won't say a word to Mr. Burton about it. Check, j.O. I'll have the still man send some publicity shots by plane immediately.

I'd better go get her or we'll spend the rest of the day admiring the scenery. Pardon me, miss Caldwell. Appeal to her better side. If you can find it! The next time anybody walks off my set, it will be I. Blowing up in the middle of a scene! You can end it on Gloria's song and cut the rest, thorny. "Cut" -- that's the extent of magnet pictures'vocabulary. "Cut the budget, it's too high," "cut the schedule, it's too long." We've been pretty luck so far, thorny. Gloria: After all, you did get the mule and the location. And you can keep it. The place reeks of rural atmosphere. Your attitude is all wrong, Gloria. When in the ozarks, do as the -- what isthere to do here, Mike? Why, lots of things -- you're born, you get married, you pay taxes and die. Just one thing you forgot, ma'am. That's getting the mortgage. That comes between paying taxes and dying. Of course, we do have barn dances. And sweet potato socials? No, thanks. You ain't even been invited yet. Invited to what, pappy? Sweet potato social. Miss Jane'd like to invite you folks over. We're gonna have music and -- and -- and -- well, what? You'd be surprised. Thanks very much. Tell miss Caldwell we'll be over. So long. "Sweet potato social --" sounds like an appetizing pastime. Me for those sweet potatoes!

Miss Jane, it's gonna happen! What'sgoing to happen?! I don't think miss Jane would want you in there. Why? What's going on? You know, the mare. Huh? Oh... Any minute now. Mortimer! Get some water, quick! Fetch a blanket from the house! Fetch a hot water bag! Quick! Miss Jane's best cover... Well, she'll forgive you. Well, I -- What's all the commotion about?! Shh!

No thanks, pappy. Birthin's ain't exactly necessary for pappy to start celebratin'. Mortimer, you get to be more like Cindy every day! Is everything all right, miss Caldwell? Just routine. Just routine? There's no need for excitement. I guess you're right. When you've been scientifically trained, it isjust routine. Can we see it now, miss Jane? Of course. Would you like to, Mr. Burton? Yes, thank you. Cindy: Isn't she cute? Mortimer: Mm-hmm! Almost nothing to her. Look at the trust in her eyes... Asking no questions, just accepting US.

No, thank you. I prefer my sweet potatoes candied. Naturally -- they do go nicely with ham. Thorny has such a sense of humor. Say, mort, how about askin' miss Baxter to sing? That's a right smart idea. Do you reckon she would? How could she refuse, seein' how it's you that's askin'? Well then, I'll ask her. Hee hee hee! Beg your pardon, miss Baxter, but we was wonderin' if you'd oblige US with a song. How nice of you to ask. Go ahead, Gloria. Really, darling, I simply can't sing without proper accompaniment. It would sound terrible. How true -- with or withoutaccompaniment. How about you, miss Jane? Yes, why don't yousing, my dear? One of your mountain songs -- they go so well with barn dances and sweet potato socials. All right, I will. But it isn't exactly a mountain song...

They're not work mules, pappy, they're too intelligent. What're you gonna make out of 'em -- school marms? Shirley's ready, miss Jane. Do you know what time they expect to use her? No, but I'll go over to Mike's -- Mr. Burton's office and find out. Mr. Burton said he would let you know, miss Jane. That-that's right, he did. But I'm sure that he'd like to know that Shirley's ready now. Whatever it is you're thinkin', you're right. So I thought you'd like to know that Shirley's ready any time you want her. Fine. How's her behavior? She's perfectly normal, but I still haven't arrived at any satisfactory conclusions. I have. About Shirley? No, about you. Would you like to hear my conclusion? As soon as I try one little experiment. Mm-hmm... After profound study and experimentation, I have reached the conclusion that -- no, i'vereach the conclusion that -- how romantic. Or were you just being polite, Mike? I'll see you later, dear. Why not let her stay? The little hick might learn something. I beg your pardon. Don't pay any attention to her, Jane. Isn't he nice? Well, he's only being nice because of the mule, and he tricked you out of her. What's she talking about, Mike? I offered Shirley myself. I see the trusting farmer's daughter hasn't quite disappeared. Mike, I volunteered Shirley, didn't I? Well, Jane, we couldn't do the picture with Shirley and I was afraid you wouldn't permit -- so all this is only because of Shirley? Oh, no, that's not true! Go ahead Mike. Answer the little rube. Little rube?! Little mountain rube, to be exact. Isn't that what you called her, darling? Gloria -- look at this! Almost a full column! "Magnet productions announced today "that Mike Burton's unit, "now on location in the ozarks "for a hillbilly extravaganza "under the direction of thorndyke p. Dunning, "have secured the services of Shirley, "the scientifically-bred mule 'from the Midlands college of agriculture. "Miss Jane Caldwell, "associate professor of animal husbandry -- appropriate spread, don't you think? That's hardly the word. I think you're right -- sensationalwould be better. Jane, I had nothing to do with this! You've lied to me about everything. I'm taking Shirley back to the college this afternoon. But the picture! You can't take her now! Of course not. We have a contract. Yes, Jane. The company's invested a lot of money in this picture, they couldn't release Shirley now. Very well, keep your contract for Shirley. But remember, you don't hold one for me. And Shirley will not work without me! Jane! Just a minute, Jane, you've got to listen! I can explain... Shh! It's true. They aremaking a motion picture. And they must be using the mule. I would say that the evidence does seem to indicate that...They are. But then, on the other hand, well, they also could notbe. That is, uh, they definitely areusing Shirley. Miss Caldwell. Professor Morris! Professor Lewis, professor Shaw, I'm so glad to see you. You are, eh? Then please explain this sensational notoriety. I admit that on the surface it looks -- we are not interested in your admissions. Pardon me, my name is Mike Burton. Burton! The man in charge the motion picture? Yes. I think I can clear this matter up -- if you don't mind! I can explain -- to Dean wexley, if you please. Your actions are a disgrace to the college! Indeed. In its entire history, there has never been such a flagrant example of unethical exhibitionism! Exactly. Well, there was that case in 1896 -- if you would be kind enough to get Shirley ready, we would like to take her back to the college. But we hold a contract! Contract? What contract? On the mule's services, Jane signed -- it's invalid. The mule is college property. Jane... You should have told me the mule didn't belong to you. Oh, I should have told you first and thenlet you trick me into it? Miss Caldwell, of course you realize the significance of all this? I know what you must think of me, but -- we have already expressed our opinions. There is nothing more to say. Now, gentlemen, surely there's some way -- Mr. Burton, I fail to see where any further discussion could alter the facts. The mule must be returned to the college immediately. And as for you, professor Caldwell, I believe you are well aware that your conduct is unbecoming to a member of the faculty. I would say... [ Sighs ] Well, I really messed it up, didn't I? Wait, Jane -- [ door slams ] Ahem! Mr. Burton. I'll have to ask you to relinquish all the film in which the mule appears. But we've used Shirley in almost every sequence, that would mean reshooting the entire picture! Gloria: Oh, thorny.. Thorny, do you think I look all right? Yes, I think so. What about you, Mike? Well, I -- oh, I'm sorry, this is miss Gloria Baxter, our star. This is professors Morris, Lewis and Shaw. How thrilling. I've always wanted to meet a real professor, but threeprofessors! You have?! She's always wanted to meet... Uh, you have? Very interesting, I'm sure. And now, if you don't mind, Mr. Burton, we must have the film. I'm sorry, that's impossible -- Mr. Burton, your picture is no concern of ours. We have the ethical standing of our college to consider! Yes! Vestigia nullus retrosa. "No footsteps backward." Now, we have come to get the mule, and -- ah... A scholar. And Latin, no less! Where did you study, my dear? Oh, I've had an extensive education. Did you really? You must tell US about it. What do you think? Think? Oh, yes, think... Mike! She can think! Veritas vinci. Truth conquers. You know, Mike, I've misjudged that girl. Snap out of it -- I'm talking about the mule! Oh, Gloria will wrap them around her finger. Don't worry, Mike, we're gotthe mule. And what did you major in? Oh, I majored in Latin. And you had a favorite professor? Well, none as nice as you and you andyou. And after school came Broadway and then Hollywood. It won't take me but a minute to change, and then we can talk. Remarkable girl! Now we can get the film and Shirley and leave for the college immediately. On the other hand... We can leave any time. Man: Get on your lights, boys! Thorny: The only difference between an actor and a mule is that the actor has an ego I can appeal to. Shirley, doesn't your career mean anything to you? Don't you want your name in lights? Please, Shirley, stand up! It's no use, Mr. Dunning, she just won't do it. All right, Mortimer, you and pappy stay up there -- I want you to drive if we ever get this thing started. Mike, I've tried everything from flattery to star billing, but she won't work without Jane. That's no use -- Jane won't even speak to me. The only time a girl won't talk to the man she loves is when she's dead. You're wrong there -- Jane isn't in love with me. Oh no, and you're not in love with her, either. That's right. No -- well, I mean -- she loves you, she loves you not -- do you expect me to crawl on my knees to her? I won't do it! Oh, you won't do it. Gloria won't act, Jane won't talk, Shirley won't work -- all we need now is a good rain storm! These are the pictures of the mule -- Rembrandt said he caught some swell ones. Thanks, Alice, I'll take care of it. You've got it all wrong. I'd talk to Jane in a minute if I only thought she'd -- if you had any sense you'd be in that house now with your arms around Jane. Okay, thorny, I'll try it once more. Shirley, keep your fingers crossed. But why did he have to lie about it? Miss Jane, all men lie at one time or another. If you love him, you accept that, along with his ear. But I don't love him, I -- [ knocking ] Come in! Hello, Cindy.Hello. The still man sent you these pictures. Cindy, will you please pack my other things? Yes, ma'am. He says he got some good shots. She looks cute in that one, doesn't she? Yes, she -- find another cute one? [ Angry: ] The cutest one of all! When do you intend sending thisone to the papers?! I didn't even know that had been taken. And you didn't know about the publicity on Shirley, either. I know you don't believe me -- I don't! I don't! Publication of that picture would mean immediate dismissal of the professors. Jane, I don't tell the still man what to photograph! I understand, Mr. Burton. I'll work Shirley -- in return for that negative. You can have the negative without that... No, thanks. I don't want any favors. I'll keep my part of this -- transaction. I don't care if you do or not. I can finish this picture in the studio without the mule! Shirley, stand up. Come on, Shirley! Shirley, pleasestand up! Cindy, something's happened again. Try singing to her. ♪ Never knew that I could sing ♪ ♪ but here I am a-makin' up a tune ♪ ♪ I'm a little bit befuddled and bewildered ♪ ♪ could it be the moon ♪ ♪ never sang a song before ♪ ♪ but suddenly I'm cooin' like a dove ♪ ♪ puttin' two and two together ♪ ♪ makes me kind of think ♪ ♪ maybe it's love ♪ I don't know, it's strange -- Shirley's always behaved before when Jane sang to her. Singing, indeed! Another one of her impractical innovations. The mule is just obstinate! I would say -- [ phonograph blares: ] ♪ never knew that I could sing ♪ Sorry, Mr. Burton, I was just testing. What was that number, Sam? I just got these platters from the sound man. I can't hear it, lift it up! [ Louder ] ♪ ...The moon ♪ ♪ never sang a song before ♪ ♪ but suddenly I'm cooin' like a dove ♪ ♪ puttin' two and two together ♪ ♪ makes me kind of think ♪ ♪ maybe it's love ♪ Gentlemen, do you realize what has just occurred? Shirley responded to the music! Precisely! But on the other hand -- and when Jane sang, her voice was sad... But the recording on that machine was cheerful. And the mule responded to it! Indubitably! Miss Caldwell, would you mind getting on the haywagon, just in case Shirley get's temperamental? If you wish, Mr. Dunning. Sam, miss Caldwell is going along -- she'll help with Shirley. Here we go. Not bad. Cindy, you can't get up there, you'll mix up everything! Everything's already all mixed up and I am to do a little straightening out! Stop it, Mortimer! Ohhh!! Gloria, would you mind moving over a bit? I hope you feel comfortable. Say, thorny, don't you think you'd better move Jane? You know how Gloria feels about her. Gloria's too intelligent to make a fuss during a scene, but when we start shooting I'll move Jane over there. Mortimer, start the mules when I say go. Whoa! Whoa! I can't stop 'em! [ All clamoring ] Mortimer, any chance of getting those mules to turn around? I can't, Mr. Burton, when Shirley makes up her mind she's goin', she's a-goin'. No use lettin' a perfectly good hayride go to waste. Cindy's right.
