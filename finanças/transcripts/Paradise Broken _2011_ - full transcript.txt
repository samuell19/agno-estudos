[birds chirping] [waves crashing] [instrumental music] (Ray) Hawaii. Waikiki Beach. Picture...postcard...perfect. But if you turn that postcard over there's another side to it. Where the real stories are told. [dramatic music] [music continues] [music continues] (male #1) 'Why don't you call me your dirty fucking howlie?' (Misha) 'A hundred more, I'll call you whatever you want.' [sighs] (Misha) 'Thank you, baby.' Now, just relax. (male #1) 'Yeah, uh, uh, yeah. Cunt!' [man grunting] [moaning] (male #1) 'Uh! Ah.' 'Oh!' (male #1) 'Wasn't even a minute. Give me my fucking money back.' Wait, sir! Stop! - Ray! - Who's Ray? [intense music] [horn blaring] [gun cocks] (male #1) 'No!' 'No!' No! [screaming] Fuck you. [indistinct chatter] - No! - What're you doing? - Let go! - What you doing? What happened to mace? - Mace isn't strong enough. - For what? - To kill him. - Are you fucking serious? Misha! That's what I'm here for. - Uh. - Misha. That's what I'm here for, okay? [panting] [sobbing] I can feel him. I can feel him growing in me. * Ah ah * (Ray) My name is Ray Geronimo. That's my girl Misha Domingo. [instrumental music] * Yeah hey * (Ray) Every year five million tourists come and stay in hotels built on swamp land. Our Waikiki mine and Misha's it's not postcard pretty. * Hey hey hey hey * Once the clock strikes 12:00 we come out the rocks like a wayo wayo scavenging small fish with big eyes. The black pimps from the mainland they run things from Yoko Hill Theater. The slingers, the surf rats the welfare queens they live in walk-up low rises like us. Or on the streets. God's forgotten children. (Misha) Tell me about the house. (Ray) Somewhere in the country. Near the beach. You can teach your son how to swim. Like a fish. [instrumental music] Nothing big or fancy. A two bedroom, you know? Like "Hansel and Gretel." [chuckles] You could plant the garden. I could build a boat. And I'll slow down, for the baby, I promise. We need another girl. - Never! - Come on. You hear me? Never! You want another girl? Oh, we need more money. You want the house, you want the dream. We need another girl. We don't need anyone else. Fuck that! Fuck that! Hey! - Fuck it! - Stop it! - 'Fuck it!' - Come on, you're pregnant. Fuck that! [glass shattering] [dramatic music] [Ray grunting] You clean this shit up. [music continues] Oh. [waves crashing] [birds chirping] Eyes are the windows to the soul. How much? A dollar. - A dollar? - Mm-hmm. Hey, keep the change. What's your name? What're you doing after-- - 'Misha!' - Sorry. Got to go. [instrumental music] [singing in foreign language] [singing continues] [instrumental music] * Ooh * Ah ah * [music continues] [instrumental music] Oh. - Oh. - Oh, what's up, Rick? Hey, how's it? You see that good-looking girl? Goin' upstairs with a fat howlie? - Yeah, Misha. - Misha? - Yeah. - Misha. Come on, bro. Twenty feet, man. - I know. - How long can you bust it? Eh, what now, she.. She hooks? No way, she too pretty. I'm not sure, brother. She goes upstairs maybe once every couple of weeks. You know, maybe she's just some girl who got holiday fever. Looking for a sugar daddy, you know? You mind if I stick around? - I don't know. - Hmm. I don't know when she'll be back down. Why? She stays upstairs all night sometimes? Yeah. Hey, you still livin' on.. Yeah, schools are fuckin' terrible. My kid's always getting in trouble. And the fuckin' drive's a bitch. But, shit, who can afford town? But it must be nice. - You live by the ocean. - Shh. Yeah, I live by the ocean. Pitch a tent. Like all the fuckin' dirty homeless that live on that side. Hey, yo! Yo! I love your photographs. Windows into the soul, right? So, what do my eyes say? - Confused. - Hey, yo! Look, I saw you, um, I saw you come out of that hotel, right? You saw me walk in, too. Yeah, I saw you walk in, too. Mm-hmm. U-uh, the, um.. So you.. If you're gonna ask me something, just ask. So what do you do besides bust balls? [chuckles] Not much. What is this? Hey, you're prettier than her. Really. You're a little liar. What do you think? You think you can take a picture of me? No, I'll pay you, I'll pay you. How much? Uh, ah, what do you want? Photography is about exposing yourself to art work so.. Really? Hundred bucks. You're hired. - What? - Take it. [chuckles] Uh. [instrumental music] [birds chirping] [music continues] [music continues] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! [thwack] Whoa! Huh. Fuckin' popolo. He runs Kalakaua. Real Hawaiian to the zoot. Man, fuck him! Probably big money. Trick for him then. Maybe. Wonder if we could join him? The answer's, fuckin' no! - What guarantee he's-- - Look, enough! Working with him isn't gonna kill us. 'He's got the most clients and pretty much owns Waikiki.' What.. What? You wanna.. Okay, let's go. You wanna join up with him? Let's go. We shouldn't. Do you want to or not? Only if you want to. [birds chirping] [groaning] (Misha) 'Still think we should hook up with that Black dude.' All that money. I know we can make it work, babe. Mm-hmm. Oh. You know I'm right. [chuckles] - No! - What? No, baby, no. Oh! I don't know much. But high is much better than low. Much, much better. [moans] [both moaning] (Ray) 'Oh, baby.' [instrumental music] (Ray) That's the thing about Misha, man. She didn't understand. No way, I'm working for some tourist California wannabe Hawaiian gangster nigger. I got other plans. I got my eye on this one girl for a few weeks. Downright rookie. Her pimp's that same fucking nigger popolo. Fuck him. This ain't his island. It's ours. [dramatic music] Hey, yo! Hey, don't be scared. I'm not scared. Hey, no one can hurt someone as beautiful as you. I've been hurt. It's only because you haven't met the right man yet. The tourists. They look nice. [scoffs] You know, all these tourists. You know what they are? Suckers. You mean like lollipops? No, no, no. Not lollipops. Suckers. Tricks. Tricks with fat wallets. It's paradise, right? I mean, that's what the brochure says. And look the ones.. The ones with their wives and kids. They're the worst, they tell their wife "I need to go to the bar, get a drink," jet lag or something? Nah. They out here walking the streets. Looking for her. She's pretty. She's not as pretty as you. [cellphone ringing] [instrumental music] - Look! Look at you. - What? Always looking over your shoulder. A good man would never have you doing something like that. I could use a quick fix. See, shouldn't be hard to ask for something you want. I mean, you're only asking, right? He'll kill me. No, he won't. [instrumental music] [chuckles] I can't stay long. No, I know, I know. I'm just gonna fix you up. - Oh! Oh! - Just a little bit. Yes. [cellphone ringing] Oh. Shit, man. Yeah, you know, my father in the homeland he's a-a wood engraver, right? So, he'll make trinkets for tourists like clocks in the shape of Philippines or boxes in the shape of turtles you know you can keep your candy inside. - Right? - Yeah. So...anyways it's like it would take him half a day to make one and then sell it for like a dollar. Hey, you know, I'll be right back. [dramatic music] [chuckles] Oh! It's beautiful. I got to pee. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah, okay. Excuse me. - Uh. - Thanks. What what the f.. Why? Why would you do that? [toilet flushing] You were the big.. Who the fuck is that? We need another girl. - Oh! - Ah! - Come on! - Get off me. - Get-- - No, no, baby. Uh! He's going to kill me now, for sure. Shh! [dramatic music] Mi-Misha. No balls, all bullshit. [door closes] Well, get the fuck out then! [intense music] (female #1) 'Ray?' 'Who was that?' She's up there, isn't she? Alright, you know what? Here. This' my card. You know, I mean, in case you're lookin' for some work. Yo! There's no name, number, anything on here. How the fuck would someone get a hold of you? Hold up. It's just a little bon voyage taste, baby. [dramatic music] [music continues] [music continues] [birds chirping] [birds chirping] [barking] [instrumental music] [crickets chirping] (female #1) 'My sister she's a genius. She's like Einstein.' 'She has a real estate license and everything.' She said I could live with her and her husband when mom got knocked up. So I went there, but her husband was such a jerk. - Oh, yeah? - You want me to try it? - Yeah, sure, beautiful. - Okay. [chuckles] So what was I saying? Oh, yeah, I had to leave. Uh, but she hates me now. Fuck her though. Mom always said I was the artistic one. And...that's why I always wanted to be a manicurist. - Okay. - Okay, wait. Need to get this on right. Uh, thank you so much. I'm so excited. [giggles] This one is my favorite. - You ready to do this? - Y-yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah, sure. - Okay? - Okay. [dramatic music] (female #1) 'Give me a minute.' 'Okay, I can't find the key.' (male #2) 'Are you sure you've any idea what you're doing?' (female #1) 'It'll be fine, baby.' 'Let me take everything out of my bag.' 'It's here somewhere.' 'I swear I'd lose my head if it wasn't connected.' (male #2) 'The word is attached. Jesus!' 'You'd lose your head if it wasn't attached.' 'Clearly, it's not.' 'You know, thanks but no thanks.' 'I'm outta here.' (female #1) 'No! Please stay.' (male #2) 'Let go of me, you fucking whore!' (female #1) 'Please?' - 'Baby?' - Yes? (female #1) 'Babe, you there?' Just come home. - Hey, come home, okay. - 'It was so--' Fuck. [instrumental music] [knock on door] [knock on door] [crying] Hey, don't worry. Hey. Don't worry I said. I'm sorry. I told you to count first. I mean check the cash. I know, right? I'm sorry. What's up with the change? One of the guy threw it at me before he left. I figured, money is money, right? - Right? - I.. I need a fix. That what you want? Huh? After all you been through tonight? Ah, you'll learn. Learn what? [sniffs] What should I do now? Go to bed. Jus.. 'Close the door behind you.' [instrumental music] Thanks, man. You wanna taste? No, never. (Ray) Never. [music continues] [ukulele music] [music continues] Hi, dad. [dramatic music] Should have called the cops on you. I never. Just like your mother. Fuckin' hungry cunt. Nowhere else to go. [sighs] You need to stop selling those pictures. You're distracting from the people paying for the music. But people like my pictures. I'm doing well. I think I could start a little portfolio. - Maybe take some classes. - No. No. No. 'It's not easy times.' You know, you.. You-you know you end up ...in the guys rooms. Doing who knows what? You end up in their rooms anyway. Ask 'em to borrow a couple hundred bucks. Guarantee they'd give you the money. Bills. Fuckin' bills. You know, when you were small.. You and mom used to come watch your daddy play all the time. It was good fun. Used to sing.. [singing in foreign language] [sighs] I see the way they look at you. Just pick the old ones. They're harmless. Plus they get money. Shit. Who taught you how to dance? Who got you out of school? I took care of you when mom left. 'You owe me!' 'You owe me.. You listening?' 'You owe me!' You owe me! [dramatic music] What? (Ray) What happened to your mother? (Misha) She went back to the mainland. When I was ten. She said she'd come back for me but she never did. Why did you bring that with you? It's nice. I.. My look, it's so...blank. It's called the Kuleshov Effect. Like.. If you put...that blank expression.. ...next to.. ...a photo of a bowl of soup. 'People will think you're hungry.' If you put it next to a coffin, people will think you're sad. Every time you look at it.. ...it's...you can feel something different. 'You know.' Do you want me to fix you up? (Ray) 'You know I don't do that.' Ray.. You're a more man than any one I've ever met. Maybe just a little bit. When I was little.. ...I was always in the ocean. And my mom used to call me part fish. And my dad used to say things, like.. "Always be careful of the undertow. 'Cause it'll drag you out take you under." (Misha) 'And he'd say..' '"Never turn your back on the ocean."' That was the only time he was nice to me and my mom. My father.. ...he said, all I need is a good house by the beach. 'A good woman..' '...nice kids..' [chuckles] And a fine fishing pool. He said, he said, the only book you need to know.. ...is God's book. [dramatic music] [crying] [music continues] [bell tolling] (Pimp) 'Hey, man.' Hey! Where's your girl? She jackrabbit on you? I'm done with her. Really? Well, shit, in that case.. Tell her if she's interested I can hook it up. She's not, okay? Yeah, okay. Well, it just so happens.. ...that I'm missin' a girl too. Pretty little thing. Dumb as fuck, though. Kinda weak. She needs a strong pimp hand, you know what I mean? You know what I mean. Do you think he's really listenin'? Yeah, I'll catch you later. [dramatic music] (Ray) 'We're broke.' I saw a $100 here last night. We already used it to cop. I'm telling you we're broke, ah. Fuck you doin'? Things to sell. Wha.. We already sold everything we can. Hey. Hey, no! That's my mothers. Sell the necklace. I sold all my photography equipment. Look, we gotta think, okay? If we can get the fares? One score. We need to think long term. We need to think long term. I have something to sell. No. No. - No. - I have no choice. - No. no. - We're broke. We quit! Okay? We quit cold turkey. Just a few times. Just a few times until we get back on our feet. - No. - We'll keep it under control. - No. - Just a few times. No! It's not that big of deal. I've done it before. [dramatic music] It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. (Misha) It's not a big deal. [dramatic music] You're mine! Not theirs. You're mine. You understand? [instrumental music] [music continues] That guy was huge. He could have strangled me if he wanted to. Cut me to pieces and no one would ever know. Never again. He wants to hook up again tomorrow night. No. Wasn't that bad. Well, I mean, 500 bucks, for 30 minutes of work. I love you. I want to show you something. Now, look. Look. It's 200 grand. Think we need maybe, 10 percent down to qualify? It's 20 grand. Five hundred a night into five nights a week that $2500. Oh, we can, we can get this in like, three months. We could have our own place. Just me and you. 'Fuck out of Waikiki.' Like a fish. You could do anything you want. Okay. We're gonna have to have a system. For security. The guy tonight was a real estate agent. Got his number here somewhere. [instrumental music] (Misha) 'Put me on speaker.' [beeps] (male #3) 'Seven hundred.' 'I get everything right?' - 'Yeah.' - 'Good.' (male #3) Just remember, I want it all. (Misha) 'Okay.' (male #3) 'If I want a lap dance, massage' 'or anything like that I'd gone someplace else understand?' (Misha) 'Yeah.' - 'You look so nervous.' - 'I'm not nervous.' 'Cash up front.' (male #3) 'Here you go.' [dramatic music] (male #3) 'Take off your clothes.' 'I wanna give it to you good.' 'Ah, that's it.' 'Yeah, baby.' [moaning] 'Tell me to fuck you.' (Misha) 'Fuck me!' (male #3) 'Tell me!' [dramatic music] [dramatic music] [sobbing] I need to use your car. Broken a long time. I catch the bus. Who you copying from? Who says I'm copying? I know one guy. Fuck that. Get out of my way. [dramatic music] [mumbling] [gasps] [coughing] What the fuck you doin'? It's dumb. I like the way it feels. Like I just stepped out of the world, you know? Okay.. Ah.. [instrumental music] I have a good feeling about tonight, babe. Hell, yeah. You look gorgeous, baby. - Yeah? - Gorgeous. - Yeah. - Yeah, good. Um...you know I got some shit to do. Wait, wait, wait. Where are you going? - Huh? - No, I mean.. You gonna be okay by yourself tonight right? - Um.. - What? - What? - My old pimp. Yeah, okay, okay, uh.. [clears throat] Okay, so here's some mace. Just in case. - I don't know about this. - No, no. I know. I know, okay? This is very important. Okay, baby? - Okay? - Really? Okay. - Okay? - Okay. - Okay. - Okay, bye. Hey, now and remember.

Shoot me right here! - 'No..' - 'Do it.' Do it! [screams] She's done with you, old man. [groaning] The fuck she is. [sobbing] I was high. I was fucked up! I am high. I am fucked up! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [groaning] I played with the best. I played with the best of 'em. We need to get the fuck out of here. It's done. He'll never bother you again. [dog barking] He's just crazy. 'Cause he's chained up like that. [dramatic music] [dog barking] Played with best of 'em. All of 'em. I was one of 'em. [sobbing] [crying] [ukulele music] [sobbing] [gunshot] [waves crashing] (Pimp) 'I ain't got but, couple girls working the streets.' You see, my girls.. My girls work mostly in the massage parlors. The parlors. That's where the sweet money's at. It's got better security. Way nicer downtown. Girl, I got me a little lounge.. ...where you can chill out.. ...get you something to eat, watch a little TV.. Ain't none of this, standing on your feet all night 'not on some fucking street corner.' 'Listening to hecklers, watching out for cops all night.' 'Feel me?' Here you go. A little taste. No, thank you. Okay. You know, it's very smart of you to get rid of that guy. I bet you all your loot you was gonna spoil his happy, right? Am I right? Look at you. Baby girl.. You see this? Do you smell that? 'That's the smell of a street walker.' Sweetheart.. ...you're days of carrying that chum...are over. Look, my girls.. Very nice girls. And they're happy to be here. Comin' over from the mainland. They just happy they ain't freezin' their asses off. See, I got this one little crew. They hit the beach down there every day. Can you believe that shit? Surfin' hoes. They got what you would call a sunny disposition. Until their time is up. See, then they got to rotate out for the next group. This paradise, baby. See, but, you.. I mean, this your home, right? So, you can stay as long as you want. [sighs] - What about Ray? - What about Ray? Look, sweetie, I don't go lookin' for trouble. But if trouble finds me, you better believe I'm gonna protect what's mine. I don't want you to hurt him. He's got a lot of pride. [sniffs] Pride? Pride? Look let me tell you something about pride. Pride ain't nothing but a weak man's second rate guts. I'm gonna take guts over pride any day of the week. You feel me? [dramatic music] [sighs] You okay? Hey.. You just go ahead and crash on the couch. We will talk business in the mornin'. We were gonna buy a house.. ...by the beach. Bay of Makaha. Best waves in the world. Is that right?
