Life has a purpose. There's a reason behind it, a plan. But sometimes you meet somebody who changes everything. The moment I saw her, I knew she had to be mine. Thanks Good morning. Good morning. One moment, please. Anything jolly today, Marcus? Carl. The editors don't bother with the novels. There's more sex and violence in your reports. Who made this mess? Probably the cleaner, dear. What's up with you? Time of the month? The author makes extensive use of asterisks and footnotes, a new departure in hard-boiled detective fiction. She calls her novel, "Jennifer, A Mystery," but the only mystery I could find was the body hair on page 32. From the moment I could first think reasonably, I knew I would kill somebody. I did not, of course, know which person I would kill or how many, but I recognized the compulsion to murder. Dear Mr. Kranze, thank you for sending us your novel, "Death in Santiago." I shall read it personally. Yours faithfully, Marcus Walwyn, editor. Marcus? Harry and I are going out now, darling. I've left you a little risotto. I don't know if people are born evil or born good, for that matter. If we are evil by nature, then it's God's will... his will, if he made us that way. What happened to you? What do you mean, what happened to me? - I'm not late. - You are. I'm not! You are. I'm not! You are. Are we going to go for a coffee? I can't. I've got to go. Why? I've got to go to work. I'll see you later, Karen! Karen? Karen. She didn't need any friends. She had me. My sleeves around my heart. Because you're gorgeous, I'd do anything for you. Because you're gorgeous, I know you'll get me through. Somebody seems to think you're a very special boy. Ah-ah. Marcus Walwyn, editor? It's just a bit premature. Mm, I know the problem. You should be an editor by now. Rumor has it, your CV's big enough. Yeah, 12 inches, but I don't use it as a rule. You're a wasted talent, you are. Dear Mr. Walwyn, may I say that I am particularly pleased that my book has fallen into your hands? Marcus, what are you wearing? You look like a ruffian. Ruff! Hmm. Oh, hello, Harry. Uh, hello, Marcus. Mother in? Yes. Ah. She's gagging for it. Thanks. See you later. So this is where she lives... not a secretary, not a model, just a beautiful, working-class babe. Ma. You've been out on the razzle? No, Marcus. Bridge night. Did you win? No. Billy Dunlop overbid like an idiot. Dump him. I couldn't do that. Why not? It's just not done, darling. Well, I'm sure Harry would partner you. Oh, what's this? Oh, nothing. Well, let me see. No, I don't want to get writer's block, do I? Oh, Marcus. You're writing a novel. How exciting. What's it about? Oh. Well, I went interrupt. I just wanted to say night-night. Mwa. Night. Did you get the message from Heather? Yes, ma. Sweet dreams. Come on then. Come on, what? God, I can't take all that. Well, take it or leave it. It's the only one I've got. I'll take it. Sunday was uneventful, unless you call having sex with Heather Brazier-Young an event. Ready to order? I'll just have a coffee please, Karen. Excuse me. Do I know you? Why, do I look familiar? You called me Karen. Did I? I'm sorry. I must have overheard your name. Oh. My name's Peter. Right, now we're even. Hello, Peter. Just a coffee then? Thanks. Here you go, Peter. Great, thanks. Would you like anything else? Yes, please. Can I get a cheese and ham toasted sandwich? Yeah, sure. Karen! Hang on. Are they not here yet? We're going to be late, you know? There's loads of time, Sharon. Sit down. And who's he? What? Cheese and ham toasted, please. Can you get us coffee while I'm waiting? And a coffee. Going anywhere special? Mind your own business. Going to the bank, actually, to see about a mortgage. Five minutes. She'll never be five minutes. Karen won't let you down. Know Karen well, do you? Just guessing. Well, stop guessing about her, all right? Five minutes. All right, bruv. Thanks, Karen. Hi, Sharon. Hiya. That's Darren, Karen's fiance. Listen, Sharon. I'm not coming between Karen and Darren, all right? Actually, I've got a girlfriend. We're getting married. Look, don't get me wrong, uh... Peter. Do you understand, Peter? She's your best friend. You look after her. That's right. I'm a very calm person. I didn't expect Karen to be intacta, but I had her down as a virgin in my dreams. Oi, traffic wardens. Come on, Sharon. Get your shoes on. Hiya. You all right, babes? Come, darling. See ya. No one else was in the dream except Karen and me... no Sharon, and definitely no Darren. In common with any other serious undertaking, murder improves with practice. Before performing on the primary victim, there is much to be said for a trial run. Marcus? You remember the Whites? What? The Whites, darling. You know, they were over last year. Whites? No. Yes. They invited me to Texas, to the ranch. When are you off? I can't leave you here all by yourself. Darling, this is it! - And have a good time. - Oh, will you miss me? OK, now on you go. Go on. Go on. Go on. I'll see you later. - Oh, darling, did you... Get going. Did you take the cases? Yes, yes, yes. We've got the cases. - Are you sure? - OK, bye, mother. Say hello to the Whites for me, OK? OK, bye. Undue haste and failure to plan meticulously are the downfall of every killer. One should always approach murder with the concept that one will most definitely be apprehended if even the smallest precaution is overlooked. The temperature? Yes, I don't want to spread it about. So when's the wedding? Well, what did Karen tell you? No, I just guessed things went well at the bank. You bought a duvet. Yeah. Won't be long now... me and Paul, Karen and Darren. You next, aye, Peter? Me first, I hope. This is your house? I just need to pick up some overalls. Then I'll drop you off. Do you want to come in and say hello to mom? Yeah, all right. It's me! Ma! Ma! I won't be a minute. Take a look at the new kitchen. Make a coffee, if you like. A well-planned murder almost commits itself. Calm and assurance are all. Peter. Ah, these units... now this is class. I don't care what you say. Paul says fit kitchens are overrated, but, no, this is what I want one day. Oh, I just dream of having a kitchen like this. It can add greatly to the excitement if some small mark is left designed to baffle the investigators without identifying the perpetrator. A corpse without a signature... An asterisk without a footnote. I came to see Miss Brazier-Young! She's at races. They all are. How did the horse do? Don't ask. It came fifth. That's not bad. There were only four in the race. Well, you can always eat it. I'll eat you if you don't let me know when you're coming. I wanted to surprise you. Marcus! All right, all right. It's a date. Bye, Heather. Dear Mr. Kranze, I'm delighted to tell you that your book is a very fine work, indeed. I have one or two points to talk over. Perhaps we should meet. Hello, Karen. I'll have a coffee and a toasted cheese and ham sandwich, please. I'm sorry? What's wrong? You don't know, do you? About Sharon? Sharon? Yes, I remember Sharon. What about her? She's been murdered. Oh, no. You really shouldn't be working. It's better if I do. Less time to think. The least I can do is give you a lift home after work. Darren's coming to pick me up. Sit down. I'll get your coffee. I could open up a new life for her, and she was waiting for the blonde bimbo biker. I'd done the trial run. Now for the main target. "My husband is away in South America just now, but I'm sure he'd be delighted to contact you on his return." "I know who killed your brother's bird. If you want to know, do what it says below. Bring me 100 quid. Come on your own. If you don't, forget it." Not bad, M. Now, try this one. Marvelous. Oh, I'm sorry, Richard. I've got to drive home. Not tonight, surely. You must stay, Marcus. You can have the guest bedroom. Thank you. Closest I've ever tasted to Petrus, and it came from a petit chateau. And we only went there to see the horses. Daddy, Marcus thinks we should eat the horses. I'm sure he doesn't mean it, dear. My precious stallion. Whoa! Bad luck, mate. Now I would have her, the girl of my dreams. Oi, watch it! Paul, it's Inspector Burt and Sergeant Wilson. You remember us? Someone had a grudge against you, Paul. Needn't be a blood feud. You can get killed over a parking space. Don't tell me. I live here. We kept to ourselves. We looked after each other. Anyone jealous of that? Look, I would know about it! We had nothing to worry us. The only thing Sharon had on her mind that day was buying a duvet. You didn't mention that before, Paul. You're never going to catch that bastard, are ya? You haven't got a clue, mate. What do you think? Nah, he doesn't know. Right. Karen Scott again. You do the talking. I want to watch her. Oh... So Darren didn't like you waiting tables. Did he ever quarrel with any of the customers? He didn't care about the customers. He never even spoke to them. But he came to see you. Karen, we have no suspects locally. We have to look again at the cafe. If Darren came, he just hurried me out! Like the last time with Paul and Sharon. She was just as bad. I think Sharon spoke to Peter. Peter. A regular customer? No. Well, recently. But you know his name. I know lots of names! We just got chatting. I thought I knew him from somewhere. Where? I don't know! Peter's not a weirdo! He's nice! He wouldn't have stood a chance against Darren. I'll tell you that. We've got three things to go on. One, the victims knew each other. Two, their bodies were found close to each other. Different MO, yes. Sharon was killed somewhere else and dumped. Darren was killed on the spot. But it has to be someone who knew that countryside and this place here. What's your third? The star he carved on their faces. I think that sounds like nice, well-behaved Peter. No, not like him. That was Sheedy from the hairdressers where Shannon worked. They remember she talked about buying a duvet. - Do they remember where? - No. Sheedy and Allen have gone looking. Forensic report... nothing on the bike except the red paint from the car that hit it. Clark. Can you go out to the Brazier-Youngs? Ask if they've seen a red car near their land. Uh, while you're at it, see if they know anyone called Peter. Cheers. Description? Early 20s, nothing too specific. Just get them talking. But don't mention claret or horses. You'll be there all day. Soft. A soft face. What do you think? Is it a good likeness? I'm pretty sure. She was good, remembered a lot. Not too much? Oh, no. She's not unreliable. I think she fancied him. Good-looking boy. They found a red Sierra. Could be the car. Let's go see. Black paint... same color as Darren Cornell's bike. Oh, thanks. Reported stolen? Yeah, three days before Darren was killed. So it was kept somewhere. What do you think? The inside is clean as a whistle. Even the driver's seat cover's gone. The tire marks match, maybe. Can we open the boot? Don't let me stop you. Sir? I thought you'd want to know straightaway. Heather Brazier-Young has a boyfriend, early 20s. He stayed there the weekend that Cornell was killed. Is he called Peter? Uh, no. M-Marcus, Marcus Walwyn. Does he drive a car? Yeah, an Audi silver. Wrong name, wrong car. Well done, Clark. We're just coming up to the scene of the crime, sir. Mm. In about half a mile, we'll be where Darren Cornell was killed. Ray, stop the car. What? Turn around! The car was kept here. Well, a car was. The Brazier-Young place? Yes, sir. Get forensics. I want to know if it was the Sierra. And wait for me here! I knew I shouldn't have told anyone about Marcus. Now I suppose you'll hound the poor sod. The derelict buildings over there, are they yours? Over by the road? Oh, the old manor? Wish they'd let us knock the bloody thing down. Do you ever go to the old manor with Mr. Walwyn? No. We use the stable for that. You're telling me you were with Mr. Walwyn for the whole of Sunday morning? Yes. He was in the guest bedroom. So was I. Uh, may I? Oh, of course. Where were you on the 5th of this month? I don't know. Oh, 5th. Newmarket. Our horse came in fifth. Mr. Walwyn was with you? No. So you can't vouch for his whereabouts on that day? Yes, I can. He came here to see me. He spoke to the gardener, then left. Now if you'll excuse me. Yes, thank you, Miss Brazier-Young. Thanks, John. Ray. Yeah. Is it the same car? It's possible. Cheerful bugger. Oi! God, I'm starving. Let's get back. I'll take you to some home cooking. Yeah, yeah. You're on. Uh, we can rule out the owner of the Sierra. Clark says he was with his mates all morning, still pissed from the night before. Oh, and, um, She... ah, ah. Sheedy found a shop where Sharon Hayes bought a duvet. Wine. Nobody was with her. She took it away herself. So what happened to it? You think she was murdered for a duvet? Well, someone could have offered her a lift. from the cafe. Oh, Walwyn? Walwyn was in the area both times, when Sharon Hayes was dumped and when Darren was killed. Karen Scott said Peter was well-spoken, better class. What if Peter and Walwyn are the same man? What's his motive? Mm. You could have shown the e-fit to the Brazier-Young girl. I know. But she was too snotty, so I didn't. Uh, not for me, sir. Get a cab home, aye? I'll pick you up in the morning. Well, just the one then. I was told when I started the job I'd get used to the bodies. Never have. What is it, sir, about this case? Ever felt like you've seen a ghost? The first murderer I met was someone called Zanke, Hubert Zanke. We knew it was him, but he killed three more people while we proved it. Used to sign his corpses with a little criss-cross. When I saw the mark on Sharon Hayes and then Cornell, it felt like Zanke was sending me a message, as if he was saying PS. And where's Zanke now? Banged up in Broadmoor. First thing I checked. It's a different mark, and we've got our suspect right here. Karen Scott says it's him. It proves Peter is Marcus Walwyn. That's all. We can't tie him to the car. We can't connect him to the victims at the relevant times. Walwyn had two days off work when Sharon Hayes was murdered. He was in the area. He announced himself to the Brazier-Youngs. It's hardly furtive behavior. We've got no fingerprints, no forensic at all. Then let's get some... search the house, put the boot in. You think he's left evidence lying around after the way he's covered his tracks? Walwyn's careful. He's clever. If we go in too soon, we'll get nothing. Just because you made a mistake with Zanke? Exactly. I'm not making it again. Someone downstairs to see you, sir. Says his name is Marcus Walwyn. Mr. Walwyn. How can we help you? I want to know why I'm being followed. If you plant detectives outside of publishers, you should at least pick people who look like they can read. Do you mind if we ask you some questions? Anything to oblige. Do you frequent Ed's Cafe, Mr. Walwyn? Occasionally. You use the name Peter. Yes. Is that your name? No. Why would you use a false name to order coffee? I just didn't want to get involved. We're investigating two murders, Mr. Walwyn. Two murders? Sharon Hayes and Darren Cornell, both friends of Karen Scott, whom you know. I knew about Sharon, but not Darren. Karen must be shattered. So you know them well. Hardly. Karen chatted to me, that's all. I knew Darren was her boyfriend because Sharon warned me off. Sharon warned you off? When was that? I think it was shortly before she was killed. Cuffs on now, is it? You're aware we questioned Miss Brazier-Young? She mentioned it. Being your girlfriend? Not really. She gobbles me dry now and then. The walk you took on the Sunday morning... Did I? Did Heather say I took a walk? No. She said you were with her all the time. I'd like you to write something down for me, Mr. Walwyn. You're not obliged to do it. No, of course not. What do you want me to write? "I know who killed your brother's bird." "I know who killed your brother's bird." Killed? Are you sure you don't want done in? Just shut up and do it. You're only as good as your staff. Aren't you, inspector? Ever driven a red Sierra, Mr. Walwyn? What am I suspected of now, membership of the working class? God. Stone me, guv. It's a fit-up. Good of you to chuckle, Mr. Walwyn. Not everyone would in your position. And what is my position, inspector? Do you know a Mr. Zanke? Mr. Hubert Zanke? I don't recognize the name, no. Should I? No reason. Thanks, again. You've been very helpful. Well, if you want me, you know where to find me. Don't you? Bastard! Still wondering if he's guilty? I've always thought he was guilty, Ray. Now I'm convinced of it. Mr. Walwyn? Yes. Who is this? It's Mrs. Kranze, sir. My husband is back in the country. He wants to meet you. That's mutual. He suggests our house at 9:30 AM on Friday. Right. Just let me check. Loring says don't wait for a written report. Why not? The handwriting doesn't match. Oh, he asked me to tell you. They're almost too different. Zanke lured his second victim to the canal with a note. Loring was on the case. The handwriting was the opposite of Zanke's own... almost too different. Sir? I don't know how, but Walwyn is copying Zanke to the letter. Now I'd completed the dirty work, it was time for romance. After all, I'd be a pretty heartless character not to offer Karen my sympathy. Karen? Hi, Karen. Hello, Peter. How are you? Coping. Good. I'll just have a coffee, please. Peter, I've got to talk to you. I'll be finished in half an hour. Can you wait? Yes, of course. Peter, I feel awful. It must be dreadful. No. I mean I might've got you into trouble. How could you do that, Karen? I told the police about you. I helped them make up a picture of your face. I feel really guilty. Karen, don't worry about me, OK? I've been to the police. I've done all I can to help. I've got my own confession to make. My name isn't Peter. It's Marcus. I like Marcus much better. Taxi! No, Marcus, really. In you get. This do for New Cross. Thank you. Marcus, you can't! Listen, I'll see you soon, OK? Maybe this weekend? Saturday. Great. - I - gave the driver her address. Bloody stupid thing to do. I'll have to be more careful in the future, a lot more careful. Sorry, Ray. I was just, um... here, help yourself. I, um... I pulled Zanke's file. Hmm? He got out yesterday on license. Where is he? He's gone home to his wife. Oh, goodness me. You are an early bird. I've got an author to see. I'm going to his home. Oh, Well, you be careful. It's the suburbs, Ma... Oh. ...not Africa. Mm-mm. Of course, I could never commission the book, but I couldn't move on without meeting the author... alone. Ah, the publishing gentleman. My husband is expecting you. All the way to the top of the stairs. Hello, Mr. Walwyn. Not the accent you were expecting, aye? Perhaps you thought I was some sort of Nazi, Mr. Walwyn. Please, sit down. So the book? The book. You like it? Very much. I thought you would. I do have some questions as to motive. You mean why my character commits murder? No, I understand that. I mean why he records the murders he commits. Recognition, Mr. Walwyn. He must make his mark. A corpse without a signature... Is like an asterisk without a footnote. So it struck a chord? My book made you different, made you act out your desires. I'm... I'm sorry. I, uh... I seem to have lost the thread. Desires? Perhaps I should pass this on to one of our other editors. Oh, no. The book is for you. You received it. You accepted it. Well, no, not yet. It's very good for a first attempt, but it needs work before we consider it for publication. You're telling me you felt nothing? I felt it had the makings of an excellent thriller. A thriller? Will you do one thing for me, Mr. Walwyn? If I can. Read the book once more. Well... Read it as fact, Mr. Walwyn. I'll certainly try and read it in that light, Mr Kranze. Thank you. Give me time, and I'll get back to you. Is it all true? Read it carefully. You won't find anything in it about asterisks and footnotes. That line came from you. I'll tell you one thing. I was glad to get out of there. The cops couldn't scare me like Kranze. He knew me without even asking. What do you want? Tell me about Marcus Walwyn. He's the man who just left your house, or perhaps you know him as Peter. Oh, so he has been a naughty boy? What was Walwyn doing here? Mr. Walwyn is editing my book. Well, no one else would write my stories, so I've written it myself. With details of the murders you committed? In full. I want a copy of that book. I can get a warrant. Helmut Kranze? It's what we authors call a pseudonym, inspector. I've written it as... as a thriller. Only this time, my hero gets away with it. Cleverer than you, aye? No, cleverer than the police. You mailed this to Walwyn from Broadmoor? Oh, no. My wife helped me to correspond from this address. I didn't wish to cause any alarm. Listen, Zanke. If you see Walwyn again, if you tell him we were here, I'll have you for conspiracy, aiding, and abetting. I'll make sure you never get back out. Inspector, I have no intention of helping Mr. Walwyn, not because of your threats, but because it would ruin the whole point of the book. Read it as fact, Mr. Walwyn. It may seem strange, but murder can be pleasant... so pleasant, it can become habitual. What made me a cut above your average murderer was knowing when to stop. Without mistakes, the police are powerless. I feel out of place. You're not. You look lovely. Thanks. Going out with Darren, it was usually McDonald's. Here's to us. Marcus, I don't want you to think... Think what? It's just... Hey, come on. Don't look so sad. We're supposed to be enjoying ourselves. Oh, I am. It's just... Look, for you. For me? Oh, Marcus. It's brilliant. I've got one of these, but it's broken. I know. How did you know? I just knew that you'd like it. So don't I get anything? You're nice to me. You're easy to be nice to. I only wish we'd... I only wish we'd met under different circumstances. Marcus, you shouldn't buy me things like this. I haven't got over Darren yet. We can only be friends. Who says friends can't give presents, for Christ's sake. You know what I mean. Look, just take it, will you? You want to kill her, don't you? I told you it becomes a habit. Give me time, aye? Sure. Take all the time you want. You're sweet. Sweet as a nut. Taxi! The lady'll tell you where. Cheers. Can I call him Marcus? Call him anything you like. Call him Darren if you want. New Cross, please. New bracelet, Karen? I had one just like it, but it got broken on the train to work. Now how would Marcus know that? Marcus, I'm sorry. I was awful. You and me used to be together, everyday together, always. Am I forgiven? Nothing to forgive. Karen! Tell him to piss off. Ask me out again. Saturday night then? Yeah. Saturday night. I've got something to tell you. You're losing your grip, Marcus. You used to knock out a pile of reports a day. I'm developing a mature style. You're stressed. It slows you down. You should get out more. What are you doing on Saturday night? Sorry, sweetheart. I've got a date with a woman. Oh, there's no need to be like that. You don't know what you're missing. Hello, Harry. Marcus. Could I, uh, ask you a favor? I've got a sort of a date this Saturday. Oh, yes? Couldn't whiz Ma away for the weekend, could you? You mean you'd like the house to yourself? I'll do the same for you. Anytime you want me out of the way, just ask. Yes, quite. Ready to go? I'm not going with you, Marcus. Pardon? I wanted to tell you, Paul and I are going to get married. You're what? It's awful what happened to Sharon and Darren. The one good thing to come out of it is it brought me and Paul together. That's crap. You two-faced slut! Paul! I'll kill you for this! - I - love you, Karen. I love you. Get off. Get an ambulance. Get after him. Don't let him out of your sight! Fucking. Marcus? K... Kranze? Marcus, you've got to stop. S... Stop what? Don't fall apart, Marcus. The police have been to see me. They've got the book. Marcus, if you stop now, they can't touch you. It's no crime to read a book. No crime? They've got no case. They'll never catch you. Stay in. Go to bed. Got to bed? Goodnight, Marcus. I knew it wouldn't work. I never wanted anything to do with it. Leave me alone! I've got to see you home. Well, I'm home, right? Now get off me. Get off! Walwyn! Walwyn! Walwyn! Right. Ah, get off me! Get off! Ah, get off! Ah! Get off! Do you want a solicitor? I haven't done anything. You murdered Sharon Hayes and Darren Cornell! No, I didn't. Karen Scott was murdered last night. You killed her, Marcus. No. No , I... I... I didn't kill Karen. I was in bed all night. Oh, just like you were sick in bed when you murdered Sharon Hayes, like you were in bed with Heather when you killed Darren Cornell. That's fiction! It's fact, Mr. Walwyn. So is this. We know it's yours. The label is in your own handwriting. I didn't kill Karen! No, I...I loved her! You threatened to do it, and you did. You marked her just like the rest, with a little star! You mean an asterisk! You got him, sir. I should have searched the house at the beginning. The evidence was there. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my client, Marcus Walwyn, stands before you with the most profound remorse. The murders of Sharon Hayes and Darren Cornell were unprovoked and willful. There can be no defense for them, and my client offers no defense. Yet on one point, he remains unshakable. Marcus Walwyn did not kill Karen Scott. I must say, poor Harry did his best, but the jury didn't buy it. They did me for Karen, as well. ...advantages of life... good schooling, a loving family. Ma was upset, of course. Heather, too. Sad waste of a perfectly decent direction. ...not only the lives of others, but, also, his own. Camp Carl came every day. Nice for some, as I'm sure he'd say. ...time of her death, he was lying at home, in bed, in an alcoholic stupor. He did not kill... But someone else was there for the verdict. Kranze looked as pleased and proud as a published author, because he was the stalker. I was still the apprentice.
