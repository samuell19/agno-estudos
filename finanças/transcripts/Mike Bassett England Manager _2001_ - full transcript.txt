Good afternoon. What a couple of days it's been. It you didn't know Manager Mike Bassett won the Mr. Clutch Cup for Norwich at Wembley on Saturday, then you just couldn't have been in East Anglia. Deep into injury time, you could really see what this trophy meant to Bassett. [crowd cheering] The final whistle marked a crushing 3-2 victory over Leicester and saw the Canaries crowned champions. Since then, it's been one big Norfolk party. And today, hundreds of fans packed the high street for a ticker-tape style reception. This was Mike Bassett's first trophy after 3 years at the club and he certainly seemed to be enjoying the carnival atmosphere. ♪ Simply the best ♪ ♪ Better than all the rest ♪ However, joy turned to confusion when the driver of the team bus took a wrong turn into the one way system. Hey! You're headed for the dual carriageway! You're going the wrong bloody way! Twenty minutes later and the team was still braving the chilly conditions. You're coming up to the roundabout now. Take the little slipover, head back. After a lengthy detour up the A11, it was back towards the city center for a repeat performance. Lancaster Gate, the home of English Football. Following the team's sudden dip in form, England Manager Phil Cope has suffered a near fatal heart attack. With only three World Cup qualifying games remaining, the Board must now find a replacement. Over the next year, our cameras will have unprecedented access to the new manager. The hopes, dreams and aspirations of the nation are about to be placed on the shoulders of one man... as he attempts to take England to the World Cup finals in Brazil. Gentlemen... I'm sure you'll join me in sending our best wishes to Phil Cope, his wife Diane and his two children, Lisa and Tom. Tim. Er, Tim. In the meantime, we need to find a new manager to take us into the World Cup. Now I've phoned around Italy, France and Spain but no one wants the job. So you know where we're gonna have to start looking. Scandinavia? England. Oh, Christ. So, fellas, any bright ideas? First choice got to be Ally McTavish, ain't it? You know, he's won the Premiership five times, Cup three times, Champions League twice. The only problem is he's Scottish. How about your Jackson over at Liverpool? Well, no question, he's a great talent, captained England 50 times, won European Footballer of the Year twice, worked wonders on Merseyside, but he is a bit, er... Mouthy. Big head. Yeah. I always rather liked, er, thingy at Villa. Well, we had a word with him, but he says he's a bit busy at the moment, maybe next time. Maybe... Martin Ernst? Leeds? Not interested. Archer over at Sunderland? He'd do a good job. He's in prison. Soliciting goods with menace. But he was at the Everton game last week. All I know is what his wife told me. So that accounts for every English manager in the premiership. Oh, come on. There's got to be somebody out there that wants the job, hasn't there? Rumors are circulating in the national press that Norwich manager, Mike Bassett, is in line for the England job. To appoint a manager from the lower leagues would be seen as an unprecedented move. Oh, there he is. He's coming down. [indistinct chatter] Hold it, hold it, lads, One at a time, one at a time. Is it true you're the new England manager, Mike? I've told you once-- I've told you a hundred times, lad. I'm the manager of Norwich. My future is here in Norfolk. So forget the rumors and the tittle-tattle, okay. Anything else? Dad, you've got the England job. Got the what? The England job. Ha-ha! It's fucking great! [indistinct chattering] Extra extra. I first met Mike back in 1975 when he was with Crewe Alexandra. And he was on loan from Doncaster at the time, so I remember thinking they might ask for him back, but luckily, Doncaster told Crewe they could keep him. And then, about a year later he got a free transfer to Plymouth. From there he went on to Hull, Grimsby and Darlington. He played for 14 clubs in 9 different positions, including goalie. So once again, the ball pumped long there. It's a back pass here to Mike Bassett. Oh, he's missed it! It's got in! What a howler! And then, finally, he got his big break. The assistant manager's job at Colchester United. And what was it that attracted you to him? The glamour. He's on the books of Norwich under fourteens. He's got a lot of talent. He just needs to up his work rate. But what's it like having a dad who is the England manager? It's brilliant. With his bags fully packed, Mike Bassett travels down to London for his first day in the new job. Our sound man is just gonna put the microphone. I thought we'd just talk a little about your appointment. Mike Bassett, you're the new England manager, but for some people you're something of a controversial choice. Well, some people ask the question, "Mike Bassett, how did he get the job?" Then other people ask the question, "Mike Bassett. Who is he? I've never heard of him." I've got to answer them people and I've only got three games to do it in. In your book, what is it that makes a successful manager? Well, there are three things. A: You got to pick the best players. B: You've got to motivate them. And C: You've got to use the right tactics. And D: Which is probably most important of all, you've got to get some luck. Really? So luck, is that important? Yeah. If the ball hits the post and goes one way, you're a winner. If it goes the other way... Tickets, please. All right, Mike. Hello, Tony. Thanks very much. Thank you. Well done with the England job. Oh, thanks, lad. Tony Pullen used to be the assistant manager in Coventry. Tickets, please. Mike's a man of principle. He has a simple set of beliefs and he sticks to them. He's a big fan of Kipling, the poet, not the cape man. So his dad gave him an embroidered poem when he was a kid and he always keeps it close by. "Yours is the earth and everything that's in it, and which is more, you'll be a mason." Unfortunately, that's an embroidery error. Hi, Mike. I'm Margaret, your PA. Oh, hello. Let me show you around. I've got a big responsibility. For a lot of people, the England team is more important than their work, more important than their marriage, more important than the telly. You've already got quite a lot of mail. Plus one or two brochures. When we win, take a look out of your window. People are going to work with smiles on their faces. They're talking to each other at the bus stop... Have a good journey. ...in the pub, on the bus itself. Football touches many people's lives and it makes a difference, a big difference. Hi. Hello, Mr. Lightfoot. Sir Ted would have loved to have greeted you himself, but Tuesday is his dialysis day. Come on in. Thank you. We've got three games over the next few months, beginning with the Polish match in 2 week's time. You'll be able to choose your own assistant manager and coach. You'll also get a company cab plus free petrol, so long as you keep the receipts. Yeah. But no monkey business. Apparently that Venables was chucking down his trips to and from the supermarket. You all right? I want you to know, Mike, I'm always here for you. And if I'm not around, just slip a note under the door. This way, Mike. This must be a very proud moment for you. It is. I just wish my dad could see me now. You know, he was like a father figure to me. Well, obviously, but, er-- he was also a professional footballer, himself, wasn't he? Oh, yes. Was a great footballer player. He played for Preston North End for just on 20 years. Never earned more than ten bob a week. What do you think your dad would say if could see you now? What would he say? I dunno, he'd probably quote Kipling, you know, something like "Walk with Kings but never lose the common touch." Ladies and gentlemen, it's my privilege to introduce the new England manager, Mike Bassett. [applauds] Fire away. Steve. International football's a big step up from the First Division, Mike. To many, you may seem underqualified, is that fair? No, not at all. A lot of very highly qualified people have done this job before me and, well, look how badly they've done. I've got just as good a chance as anybody. Christopher. Yeah, um, now that you've got the job, what's your ambition? To win the World Cup. [chattering] Mike... Mike... You seriously think you can do that? Why not? What, you believe we're better than the Germans, the Brazilians, the French, the Argentines...? Excuse me. Look, people like you are always running our country down. I mean, you forget what a great nation we are. I mean, we invented Parliament, we abolished slavery, we-- we defeated Hitler. And then we came up with the, the computer, the singing telegram, the Bessemer Smelting Process. We had people like Wordsworth and Shakespeare and Dickens, you know. "Once more unto the breech, dear friends, once more." And d'you know what else we done? We invented football and we gave it to the world. Well, I'm gonna go out there and I'm gonna bring it back. Thank you. That lady over there, please. Bassett's first job is to appoint a coach and an assistant manager. I've worked with Dave Dodds and Lonnie Urquart on and off for over 10 years. Over at Colchester, we adopted the system that's been copied by clubs up and down the Third Division. You know I understand that. What can I say about Dave Dodds? Great coach, always positive, never says no-- not unless you want him to. So, are you in? Aye, dead up for it. Good lad. Okay, what I want you to do, concentrate on fitness. Fitness... Set pieces... And basic skills to start with, okay? Brilliant, boss. Wife's been on my back since I got the chop at Forest. Then there's my assistant manager, Lonnie Urquart. Rarely says yes, more likely to say maybe, or possibly even no. And you need that balance. Is that all you want to do? Sell second hand cars? Don't knock it, Mike. We offer good motors at affordable prices. Take this, a Daewoo Nexia. Now you wouldn't know it, but basically it's your re-badged Vauxhall Astra. Alloy wheels, ABS, twin airbags, central locking, air conditioning. That will be the Daewoo. I'm talking about the assistant manager's job here. The World Cup, Lonnie. Jules Rimet, Maradona, Ally. She is an absolute beauty. What do I have to do to get you to take the job? Bassett can afford to be pleased with himself. His coaching staff are in place and he's acquired a new car. Now he makes the long drive north to Sunderland to visit footballing legend, Kevin Tonkinson. We came together about 12 years ago. I was at Colchester, and he'd just signed on. Lot of money on the table off the big boys, and he could have walked. But he never, he stayed, and he took us up. I believe in repaying my debts, that's why I'm here. I also believe that this lad can win us the cup. [cheering] I've got it. Are you sure you've got it, because you don't look to me as if you've got it. I've definitely got it. I've got it, it's in me pocket. I watched you recently, and everyone was saying you'd lost it. I haven't lost it, I've just mislaid it, but I know where it is and I can go and get it. You promise me that? I promise you, boss. Okay, get off the booze, get down the gym and you're back in the England squad. Okay? Oh, boss... Bassett gathers his squad together at Bisham Abbey training ground, to prepare for their first encounter. Catch him up, catch him up. Come on, catch him up. Come on. Well done, Danny. Well done, Dan. He's a lot sharper, Doddsy. Aye, lot sharper. Well done, son. Well done, Robbo. I've got this group of lads for 1 week. It's my chance to see who can do what, where, how and when. That's it. He's awake. Harnessing and motivating, that--that's what my game's about. It's about getting the best out of people, you know, turning good players into great players. Or at least converting bad players into mediocre ones. Okay, lads, pay attention. We're gonna split up into two teams. All those born in the first half of the year stay where you are. All those born in the second half of the year that side of the line. On your toes, lads. Come on, first half of the year this side. Second half that side. Come on, boys, two teams. Deano, when were you born? February, boss. Wacko? January, boss. Alan? March, boss. Danny? February as well, boss. No one born in the second half of the year? No, boss. Right, er, all those born in the first half of the month stay where you are. All those born in the second half of the month, other side of the line. Okay? I don't believe this. I've got to pick 11 men from this squad. That's it, good lads. And, of course, some lads almost pick themselves. You know take my captain, Gary Wackett. An old fashioned center back but he takes no prisoners. Well, not unless he's gonna torture them first and kill them later. There'll be fucking more of that if you want it, do you hear? It's only fucking training. Well, like Wellington once said, "I don't know what he does to the enemy but he scares the shit out of me!" The only problem is red cards. Out of 26 international games, he's only completed five. A lot of people call me a psycho, a nutter, an headcase, but there's a lot more to my game than just kicking people. I mean, it's all well and good being passionate, but you got to know how to control it. So how come you've been sent off 25 times then? Are you trying to fucking wind me up? Then there's Rufus Smalls. A real life Roy of the Rovers and England's all-time top goal scorer. And he used to be a captain on "A Question of Sport". Grand National winning jockey Richard Guest is our regular team captain and England's top goal scorer, Rufus Smalls. Then 2 years ago he missed that penalty against Portugal in the Quarter Final shoot out. Overnight he went from hero to zero. Hasn't scored since. In midfielders Daeno and Danny. Tweedledum and Tweedledee I call them. They're like twin brothers though, of course, they're not-- 110%. 120%. Yeah, 120%. And then we've got Steve Harper. Best crosser of the ball in the world. Always on the mobile to his wife. The boys tell me you're something of a playboy. No, not at all. I'm not interested in glamour girls, the fast cars and champagne lifestyle. I play football 'cause I love football. It's my life. [cell phone ringing] Sorry. Hello, darling. Yeah, there's a magnum in the Ferrari. And I've brought in young Alan Massey on the wing. He's a shy lad but he's brilliantly gifted. And he's not stupid either. He's got five "O" levels under his belt. Er, yeah, I got a "B" in technical drawing. Er, got a "C" in geography and human sciences. Er, had a place lined up at Keele University. I love your hair. Hasn't he got lovely hair? excuse me, we're gonna have a bath. Tonka? He's a genius. What he can't do with two legs isn't worth knowing. Give me that lad's legs and someone else's brain, you've got a winner. There's lot more to my personality than just doing stupid things, stupid voices. I mean, what I'm at home I've got a lot of different personal things that I get involved in. I like stamps, I like... Donkey! Betty Swollocks was ducking fisgusting... [indistinct] [indistinct] [indistinct] and a hid bard-on! Don't you stare at me. [indistinct] Oh, Olive. Do you know I wanted to be a butcher but I didn't meet the criteria and I got the chop! But music, I love music, you know. [chattering] All right, boys, simmer down. Here we go. Pay attention. Now most of you don't know me, but you're gonna get to know me. I'm an old-fashioned manager. I write the team down on the back of a fag packet and I play a simple 4-4-2 system. Okay? Harpsey? Yeah. Sorry. Here we go. Here's the line up for Saturday. Berksy in goal. Macca, Parksey, Wacko and Smudger in defense. Midfield we've got Danno, Tonka, Deano and Alan. And Harpsey and Smallsy up front, okay? Right, we'll put this on its feet after lunch. Off you go. Come on, boys. [chattering] Excuse me, boss. Can I have a word? Smallsy and Harpsey up front. Smallsy and Harpsey? Yeah. And in field we got, er, Danno, Tonka, Deano. And, Alan, you're on the left. Yeah, but... Well, what's the problem? Why can't I have a nickname? England wins 3-0 easy days. Tonka's gonna go straight down the middle, 1-nil, third minute. Come on, England. England! Poland, bunch of fucking muppets. Whip 'em 3-1 easy. Aren't we? Yeah! And what do you think of the new manager? Oh, he seems very nice. I've seen every home game last 15 years. We're gonna walk it. It's a packed Wembley and a tense England dressing room for the new manager's first game. Deano, Danny, right, are you ready for this, boys? You know the score. If you're in trouble, he's there for you, okay? And if you're in trouble, you've got him. Come on, look at each other. Got that? Sweet, boss. Okay. Hiya. Have you seen my arse anywhere? Are you all right, son? Alan? Alansy. Baby, baby, I do care how you feel, all right? Harpsey, can I have a word? Oh, sorry, carry on. That's it, continue. You all right there, Smallsy? Yeah, yeah, I'm all right, boss. You got the best part of the dressing-room here, you know. It's Charlton's lucky peg. Yeah? Do you hear that, boys? I got Bobby Charlton's lucky peg. No, Jackie. Jackie Charlton. Now, come on, chaps. Okay, lads, come on, quieten down please. Let's have a bit of quiet for a minute. Okay, just remember to keep your shape, eh? And if the goals don't come early, don't panic. Keep your cool, okay? Have you got that? Okay, Wacko, lead them out. Let's fucking kill 'em! Right, come on! Bassett's first game in charge, and he adopts a traditional 4-4-2 system. That's 4 players in defense, 4 in midfield, and 2 in attack. Many critics of this system say it's too inflexible for the modern game. Bassett set's out to prove them wrong. [loud cheering] Thirty seconds into the game... Go on, lads. Get stuck in. And captain Gary Wackett goes for the ball, and accidentally takes the man. Good decision, referee. Nothing wrong with that. He's world class! Come on, son. Come on, son. With 20 minutes to play, England are one up. Then, disaster strikes. Bassett has now got his work cut out. Come on, Smallsy. Go, go, go! Back! Back, come on, short, sharp passes! Back to Berkitt! Macca, Macca, Macca, they're gonna score! Nice goal. Well done, Poland. England go on to lose 2-1. For Bassett, the honeymoon is over. Mike, Mike... What went wrong, Mike? Tommo. Right, right, right, there wasn't any width. Er, both of your strikers were marked out of the game, you had no one coming up from deep. What do you say to that? Um, in some respect that's a fair comment, in others, no, I totally disagree. Mike, what about fitness? Tonka looked completely knackered after 20 minutes. That's true, yeah, but what a 20 minutes, eh? Do you really think the 4-4-2 system's gonna continue to work at this level? Oh, come on, now you're talking through your bloody hat. If that system is good enough for Sir Alf Ramsey, it's good enough for me. Now come on, boys, try and be a bit positive. There was a lot of pluses come out the game. Like what? Well, we didn't pick up any injuries for a kick-off. And, listen, eh, listen, we're second in our group. We've only got to win one of our last two games and we're through to the World Cup. So come on, lads. How about getting behind the team for a change? How do you think the manager's doing? Well, international football is a big step up for Mike Bassett, no disrespect to Norwich, and the big question is, can he handle it? Do you think he can get you to the World Cup finals? I don't know. I'll put it this way: if we don't get a result in the next 2 games, we'll be spending the summer as guest presenters for channel 5, and no one wants that. The lads looked tired. Oh, aye, boss, knackered. Tonka had all the pace of an Austin Allegro, and I'm not talking Vanden Plas. Oh, well, there's no use putting it off. Let's have a look at the video. Got it here, boss. Honda are releasing a new Accord this summer, Mike. What do you reckon? Oh, very nice. Here we go. Right, here we go. Off Kevin Tonkinson. Massive interest, Mike Bassett's first game in charge. It's Poland to kick off. Come on, lads. What's-- what's happening here? What's going on? Oh, you know what's happened? Wife's videoed "Changing Rooms" over the top. You're joking? No, no, you're all right, Mike. It's not "Changing Rooms", it's "Ground Force". You don't get many of them in a pound. Geoffrey? Geoffrey? I'm sorry, Mike, I've got a meeting. Yeah, I've been trying to get hold of you for a few days. Well, I'm very busy at the moment. I'm hoping to get all the lads together down at that new sports lab thingy. Look, Mike, I've just got in. If you got a question, jot it down on a piece of paper, slide it under the door. But I done that 3 days ago, Geoffrey. Well, there's no note here, Mike. Ah... here it is. Oh, there's one here from Ron Greenwood. How about dropping Mick Channon? Er, yeah, okay, if he's happy with that. That's a good ball. The team look in pretty good shape. Good shape, yeah, yeah, good shape. Er, good team. Looking very good. Couldn't be better. Having said that we're-we're not actually playing very well at the moment. No, no, terrible, terrible. Terrible shape. Terrible team. Looking very bad. Then again, the omens do look good for England. Oh, aye, looking good. Very good. Tucked away deep in the Staffordshire countryside is the recently established Sports Science Institute. Mike Bassett is gambling that this state-of-the-art multimillion pound training facility will transform the performance of the team. Smallsy, you're a big lad, you could do with a bit more room. Now... No, it's fine. I've got one word to say to you... Hyundai. How is that motor? It's good as gold. Why don't you come and see me... Your shockers are gone on that! Hyundai... That is the car of the future. What happened to the paint work? Yeah, this color, you know, is not right for you. Hyundai Daewoo, need I say more. Alarm will sound if you do not back away. How it's going, Doddsy? Yeah, great, boss. Looking good. Loads of gadgets and gizmos? Oh, definitely, boss. Lots of them. Mr. Bassett? Ah, how do you do? I'm Dr. Shoegaarten. Nice to meet you. Yes. Let me show you around. We at the Sports Science Institute believes that positive energy and good mental health plays, er, a vital role in maintaining an athlete's overall effectiveness. Success. You see, when a striker is going through a lean period, he needs to be reacquainted with the soccer ball. Calm. Here we have the gyrosphere. Hello, Smallsy. How you doing, son? Yeah, I'm okay, boss. Good lad. Whoa. Yes, see, in order to be at one with the ball, you must ultimately become the ball. Ah, yeah. Bring it up. Increasing speed. Get me out now, boss, please. This way. Boss? I think I'm gonna be sick. Oh, please... oh, God. How long will he have to stay in there? Er, anywhere for 2 or 3 hours, depending on the athlete. Yeah. Will he be all right in there? This is perfectly normal. Okay. Come back. No, don't leave me. No, come back! Here we have the Fear Behavioral Intervention Room. Hmm? Fear is the soccer player's worst enemy. Strapped in. It stifles the creativity and causes errors in play. All right, Wacko? Boss. Fear program activated. Go for it, Wacko. Fear. Good. Very good. See, this man has achieved a level of cognitive behavioral harmony, where fear no longer dictates his actions. Good. Very good. Put the next one in, please. Yeah. This way. Oh, don't touch that... Over here we have the skill replicator. Skill. How you feeling, lads? 100%, boss. Dribbling the ball is about balance and control. This machine replicates the body movement of the greatest dribblers of all time. Pele. Pele. Diego Maradona. Maradona. And are we here? Mark Lawrenson. Mark Lawrenson. Mark Lawrenson? Well, we ran out of money. To defeat the best, we have to become the best. Let's play. Simulation commence. Maradona. Dribble. Feint. Pele. Here mate, is it supposed to go this fast? Mark Lawrenson. Concentrate. What do you reckon, Doddsy? Help, boss, boss! Boss! I will start scoring again, I promise I will! Here, mate, mate... Control. Dribble. Boss, turn it off! The following morning, Jack Marshall, the England team physio, has got his hands full. What's the problem Alan? Wrist. All right, get your pants off. Jack? Give us the worst. Berkitt? Back problems. Wacko? Broken jaw. Smallsy? Unsettled. Unsettled? What sort of bloody injury's that? I dunno. He's just a bit... Alan Massey's got problems with his groin. Wrist. Danny and Deano are not 100%. The Sports Science Institute has been a disaster. The knee's about 80%, boss, but me hip's only 60%. With 7 of his key players injured, Bassett is forced to pick a new squad for the Belgium game. Here's the squad list. I've already given several copies to the press. Oh, well done, Margaret. Thank you. Hang on, there's 28 names down here, I only picked 26. Well, that's the list you gave me. Tony Hedges, York City? I didn't pick him, love. You must have, Mike, I wouldn't have put him down otherwise. Never bloody hear of him, have I? And who's this clown, Ron Benson, Plymouth Argyll? I copied the list you gave me. Oh, come on, Margaret, tell me where it says Benson and Hedges on that? Ron Benson and Tony Hedges. Bollocks. Yeah, I said there'd be a few surprises. They're Third Division players. One of them is 46. I know, but I've always said if you're old enough, you're good enough. Who else are you looking at, Mike, Lambert and Butler? Very funny. Er, I understand Peter Stuyvesant's available. Can we get back to the football, please? Yeah, er, you happy with this squad size, Mike? That's more like it. Thank you, Tommo. Um, yeah, I'm quite happy with the squad size, it's not too big and it's not too small. It's, er, it's just right. Right. So you won't be choosing 20 players then? Belgium versus England, and Mike Bassett's second game in charge. Rufus Smalls attempts to put his acute psychological problems behind him. Bassett has the players really fired up for this one. Even captain Gary Wackett shakes off a broken jaw to pull on the white shirt. ♪ God save the Queen ♪ Come on boys. Come on, boys, let's get into 'em! No fear, boys! Fucking go for it! All right, Benson, take it easy. Talk to Hedges. Let's do it. England go on to lose 3-nil. ♪ Extra extra Extra extra Extra extra Extra extra ♪ We don't seem to be playing with any confidence, or cohesion. I mean, one or two lads have started to doubt whether we'll qualify. Some are even checking to see if they've got Irish grandparents, jump ship like. Um, got room for one more, lads? The last few months have been difficult for us. Obviously, when you see your husband called names like clown, loser. Liquorice Allsort. Liquorice Allsort... It gets you down. Has it affected you? It's bound to. We can't walk down the street without someone shouting "drop Tonka", or "drop Smallsy". "Drop the 4-4-2." Yeah, yeah, a lot of people say "drop the 4-4-2"... But we don't let it bother us much, do we love? They're throwing eggs now. That's disgraceful. I thought I told you to clear off yesterday! And United steaming forward once again. This is majestic stuff. Jesus Christ! Mike used to be able to switch the football off when he came home. Nowadays it's all he thinks about. Now let's see what the referee's going to do about it. Even our Jason's stopped going to the football. Man United's on the telly! Last week, a couple of lads from school tried to set fire to his trousers. It isn't easy. Go and have a word with him, will you, Mike? It's yellow. It's got to be a red card, referee! Mike. Open up, son. [knocking on the door] Come on, Jason. Open the door. What's that on your face? Felt tip. What are you writing swear words on your face for? Oh, Dad. I don't know. Go and clean it off. What's the matter with you lately, eh? Last night Mike dreamt that a giant Bobby Moore was chasing him around Wembley stadium shouting "Look, what you've done, you bloody idiot!" I can't stand you when you're like this. I'm going out. To be honest, I'll be pleased when this whole thing's over. [telephone ringing] And this better be bloody good news. Hello? Look to the left. It wasn't my fault, boss. Well, I had to swerve to avoid the traffic. Only because you were on the wrong side of the bloody road! How many milligrams did you have? 88. 88 bloody milligrams! You go on the piss all day, you've ballooned out like the Pilsbury Doughboy! You've really let me down this time, Tonka, I'm telling you. Well, look, I--I've wrote an apology, boss! Oh, fuck the apology! You could go to jail for this! What sort of system am I gonna play then? Three across the middle and one in bloody Pentonville? Eh? You're dropped. Oh, no. Oh, don't drop me, boss. Please don't drop me. No, no, no. I gave you a chance, you blew it. Yeah, but don't drop me. I, I'll get better, boss. I'll get better. No, no, no. I stuck me neck out for you and this is how you bloody repay me. I know, but I'm sorry! How are you coping with the pressure? Don't make me laugh, this isn't pressure. My dad raised five kids single-handed, and there's me mum who was bed-ridden for years and years and years with arthritis, and done a full-time job. Then he'd go out on a Saturday and score three with his head. That's pressure. Try storming a Japanese gun placement with only three bullets in your Tommy Gun, and taking one in the chest, and going on to win the VC. That, my friend, is what you call pressure. Is that actually what your father did? No, no, he never went to Japan, but somebody bloody did! And compared to them fellas, bloody hell, this is a walk in the park. Many of the press are suggesting England's problems lie in Bassett's antiquated 4-4-2 formation. In recent games, the front two players have been man marked and unable to find space while the back four have been static and easily caught by the ball over the top. Various alternative strategies have been mooted. The German 5-3-2 system incorporating two wing backs and a sweeper and the popular 3-5-2 system in which the team swamps the midfield. Either way, pressure is mounting on Bassett to change his tactics for the Slovenia game. Can you tell us the latest team news, please, Mike? Well, yeah, I've had a long talk with Tonka, and I've decided to give him another chance. Oh, no. However, I'm sure you'll all be pleased to hear that I am dropping the 4-4-2. And, we're going for something completely new. We're gonna try the 3-5-1-1. What's that? Which is very similar to the Terry Venables' Christmas tree, but with the wing backs here holding in midfield. It's more of a Christmas pudding, ain't it, Mike? Well, if you like, yeah, with Tonka in the middle as the sixpence. It's D-Day. England play Slovenia while second place Turkey are at home to Luxembourg. England must win, or hope that a minor mathematical miracle will see them through. Wackett begins the game in a typically robust fashion. No, Wacko! Leave it! Please, let it go. Wacko, don't do that! Oh, Christ Almighty! Referee! That was never a red card offense! Oh, come on, referee! I want you to fill in for Wacko. What, central defense, boss? Not in the center, in the thick of it. You know, backwards and forwards, up and down, in and out and... I don't know, you just do what you want. Come on. Come on, Robbo. On your toes, lad. Go on. Go on, son. Less than 10 minutes to go, and England pile on the pressure. Referee, penalty! Yes! Okay, Smallsy, take it, son! Yeah, you, go on! Are you sure, boss? Oh, no problem. Put it away, son! ♪ Trouble ♪ ♪ Trouble is a lonesome town ♪ ♪ Trouble is a lonesome town ♪ England can only manage a nil-nil draw. Piss off, Bassett, you're shit! You're shit! You're shit, Bassett!

You're joking me. Incredible scenes here as the amateurs of Luxembourg have taken the game to Turkey. Luxembourg one up. And if they can just score again, England are through! The ball is knocked wide right to little Wim Fleidermouse, the tiny hotel manager from Mertzig. Come on, my son! A nice one two with Flemhoeben, into the area. Oh, he's nutmegged it through and that's a fantastic goal! Someone pinch me, I must be dreaming! Fleidermouse rides to the rescue, and England are on their way to Brazil! Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg! [cheering] Wa-hey, lads, look at this. We've got a Jacuzzi! Mike! Mike! Mike, you're on the way to the World Cup. Yes. Are you pleased with the lads? Pleased? I'm bloody delighted. The boys were superb, especially that Wim Fleidermouse. He is first class. Brilliant. Congratulations. Cheers! Here comes another one, lads! Oh, bollocks! I've shit myself. Monday the 13th of May, and the team make the traditional pit stop en route to the Finals. Hiya. The recording of the World Cup song. This one will be performed by the England squad, and UK chart toppers "Atomic Kitten". Who sadly today are one kitten short of a full litter. Natasha is laid low with aggravated campylo bacterial gastroenteritis, otherwise known as food poisoning. Fortunately, the song's composer... Fuck off. ...actor, comedian and profligate hellraiser, Keith Allen, does not let them down. "It's on me head, son, not off me head, son". Very sharp. On me head, son... Guys, you got to give him a chance. Football song? Yeah. Yeah, of course it is. With the lads' voices and our voices, it's bound to go to number one. ♪ England! ♪ ♪ England! ♪ ♪ England! ♪ And England have qualified for the World Cup finals in Brazil. ♪ It's on me head, son ♪ ♪ not off me head, son! ♪ ♪ It's on me head, son ♪ ♪ not off me head, son! ♪ ♪ We won't get ♪ ♪ no satisfaction ♪ ♪ from the final score ♪ ♪ If you want to get ahead ♪ ♪ in this game ♪ ♪ you got to want ♪ ♪ a little bit more ♪ ♪ These boots are made ♪ ♪ for running ♪ ♪ and that's what ♪ ♪ they will do ♪ ♪ It's on me head, son ♪ ♪ not off me head, son! ♪ ♪ It's on me head, son ♪ ♪ not off me head, son! ♪ ♪ It's on me head, son ♪ ♪ not off me head, son! ♪ ♪ It's on me head, son ♪ ♪ not off me head, son! ♪ ♪ E-N-G-L-A-N-D! ♪ ♪ We're Bassett's Allsorts ♪ ♪ [indistinct] ♪ ♪ Marching onwards to Brazil ♪ ♪ We look cool in espadrilles ♪ ♪ In Brazil with baggy shorts ♪ ♪ We lost the odd flip-flop ♪ ♪ Beer and fags ♪ ♪ and salsa sound ♪ ♪ But we don't do hip-hop ♪ ♪ Dancing in the streets ♪ ♪ all day and night ♪ ♪ Don't need no pills ♪ ♪ Bassett's Allsorts Army ♪ ♪ is how we get our thrills ♪ ♪ It's on me head, son ♪ ♪ not off me head, son! ♪ ♪ It's on me head, son ♪ ♪ not off me head, son! ♪ ♪ It's on me head, son ♪ ♪ not off me head, son! ♪ ♪ It's on me head, son ♪ ♪ not off me head, son! ♪ ♪ Nippon! ♪ ♪ E-N-G-L-A-N-D! ♪ ♪ We're Bassett's Allsorts ♪ ♪ Army ♪ ♪ Marching onwards to Brazil ♪ ♪ We look good in espadrilles ♪ Right, you keep your eye on the lads, I'll go and sort the transport out.

How are you doing? make sure you get him hold the plane 'cause you'll be going back in a week. Fuck off. Hey, plonker's sober, get the cameras out. Oi. Costa Rica got a handy side this year. Yeah, Iraq are looking a bit tasty and all. Is that right? Aye, who's with the hand of God squad? The hand of God? Aye. Not us. Hey, I don't believe it. Here come the Paddies. Let's hear it for the England B team. Is that why we always kick your arse then, yeah? 'Ere, what are you putting the accent on for? You're a cockney, you mug. Shut your mouth, you Proddy bollocks. Who are you calling a Proddy bollocks, you Fenian twat? Hey, I'm a Fenian. Hey... Who you fucking...? You fucking scumbag English twats. Pele, who--who do you think will win this World Cup? Listen, every World Cup people want to know who gonna win. It's very difficult to say who gonna win. But normally, you have Italy, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Spain, France, normally those teams come to the final. Apart from them? Well, yes, maybe you have some surprise, because now we have, er... you know, good team like Yugoslavia. You have United State that are good. Apart from them? England have been drawn in group 6, alongside Egypt, Mexico and their old enemy, Argentina. Yeah-No, I couldn't talk to you on the plane. On arrival in Brazil, the team decamp to their hotel on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. I asked for a Vauxhall Omega, and they give me this. An Opel. I mean, what's a fucking Opel when it's at home? All right, Pedro, keep your hands off. Okay, now have you all got the right key? Yes, yes. Right, well, here's the rules. There's no late nights, there's no girls, and there's no drinking. And just remember, you are out in someone else's country, so let's treat them with respect, eh? Yeah, I think what Mike's trying to say here, lads, is keep an eye on your luggage. These wops will rip you off soon as look at you. Thanks a lot, Lonnie. Cheers, mate. This is it, it's here. 32 teams playing 64 games in temperatures of up to 38 degrees. We've got 96 hours of football over the next 4 weeks, which is 28 days. And with me to watch all this, and provide expert analysis, former Newcastle and England international, Barry Venison. Welcome, Barry. Gabby. First though we're gonna go live to Mike Bassett. He's enjoying life by the pool in Rio. Mike, I've got your old pal Barry Venison here with me. Mike, how are you doing? Hello, Barry, how're you doing, son? I'm just saying, Mike, how are you doing? Are you keeping well? Hello? Are you looking forward to the tournament then? You know, confident, son. Quietly confident. I tell you what, you look as if you're enjoying yourself, don't you? Hello? What, what's that you're drinking? No, no, they're looking after us fine, thank you. I bet you've got your fishing rod with you as well. Yeah, it's a pina colada. A large one. Mike, tell us, what-what's going to be your tactics for the Egypt game? Couldn't get it into the suitcase. Um, we're gonna have to leave it there, I think. We've got some technical difficulties, Mike. But thanks ever so much, yeah. It's Saturday and England face their first challenge. They'll be playing Egypt, the softest team in their group. Um, what, mate? The thing is, Smudger, I think I might have you here. So much so, 1,000 Reals to see you. Mr. and Mrs. Bun. Bollocks. Just relax now. That's it. Gucci. Versace. Ferrero Rocher. 'Cause I'm going to the Ambassadors' reception. Mike, I sense there's a new mood of confidence in the England camp. That's right, yeah. Well, we're confident we can go all the way. I think you're gonna see a few surprises in this tournament. [cheering and applause] England, England, England! You're shit. You're shit. Useless fucking wanker! No fucking... Fucking manager? Wanker! Do you think it's big and clever, do you, swearing and shouting at people? Can't you think of something constructive to say? Because if you can, I'd like to hear it. Yeah, all right. Why don't you play two people up front instead of one? Two. Okay, anything else? Yeah, you could switch Robbo from the left flank to the right 'cause he's a lot more constructive with his right peg. Yeah, and bring Tonka back into the attacking midfield role, right. Danny drops back and he shores up defense. It's easy. [cheering] It would be nice to see Massey make some of his jinking runs into the box like he does for his club. That's it. And with Rufus and Fairbrother alongside each other up front you've got an effective partnership of strength and skill. Fuck off. Here we go again, look. Mmm, they're hooligans, aren't they? They're not real football supporters. They're bloody psychotic thugs, the lot of them. Look at the way they're behaving. They shouldn't be allowed to travel, watch their national side, should they? Look, them old women are petrified. Look at that lad, lashing out with their feet, look, Goading the police. They want their passports taking off them and they want bloody locking up, the lot of them. Hang on, that's Wacko. What's he doing? Look, he's right in the thick of it. Oh, my God. Oh, no. You're shit and you know you are. You're shit... Hello, love. Oh, so-so. Did you hear about Wacko? Not too good. Yeah, broken leg, dislocated shoulder, fractured skull, and couple of broken ribs. No, that was just a Brazilian policeman. No, Wacko's fine. But they reckon he could get up to 3 months, you know. But, but... you never know down here, do you? Anyhow, how's Jason? What, they've shaved his eyebrows off because we drew with Egypt? Oh, fucking hell! Could you just give us a bit of privacy a minute, please, boys? Just a minute. Now, Karine, love, don't cry. No, he'll grow them back. No, they grow back in no time. Yeah, well, just get him a bloody balaclava for now. Back in London, the pressure on Karine is beginning to show. Well, enough's enough. Look at his eyebrows. He's gonna have to wear a hat for the next 6 months. I've told Mike that we're gonna move in with my sister for a while. It's not worth it. Chins up, eh, lads. Come on, chins up. Lads, come on, chins up, eh? Big smiles, come on. Look, forget about the Egypt. We've got a new plan for the Mexico. We're gonna drop the Christmas pudding. We're gonna go for the 3-1-2-1-2-1 formation. Now look, you're gonna have to pick this up as we go along, because we haven't got much time, so, come on, lads, let's go, eh? Come on. Come on, on your feet. Nice and bright. Come on, lads, eh? Come on, lads, let's move it. Up, come on. Where's the balls, Doddsy? Come on, lads, where are the balls, eh? Come on, get the balls, lads. Come on, lads. Doddsy, where's the balls? I don't know, boss. Alan? Alanso? Ally, where's the balls? Lonnie has got them in the back of his Opel. Where is he? Went into town to do some shopping, boss. Jesus Christ. Get over there and get the ball off them kids, will you, Doddsy? Hurry up. Eh, rightio, boss. Okay, lads, this is what I want you to do, I want you to say to yourselves... We're better than the Mexicans. We're better than the Mexicans. We're better than the Mexicans. [indistinct] Smallsy. We're better than the Mexicans. Good, good. Now, look, some of you lads are on 50 grand a week. These fellas, they got a pocketful of pesetas and a funny hat. Ball, lads, eh? Come on. So let's go out there and show them our superior skills, our techniques. You know, dribbling, set pieces, one twos, stuff like that, eh? Do that again-- We're class, class! Where's the ball? I tell you what, boss, they took it round me like I weren't even there. We are better than Mexicans. We are better than Mexicans. Come on, lads, louder. We are better than the Mexicans. We are better than the Mexicans. Come on, lads. We are better than the Mexicans. Half-time in La Bombonera Stadium and England trail Mexico by two goals to nil. Have you heard what the crowd are... shouting? Bassett's a (bleep)! Bassett's a (bleep)! Bassett's a (bleep)! They shouldn't be shouting at me, they be shouting at you! And do you know why? Because it's (bleep) half time and we're (bleep) 2-0 down to the (bleep) Mexicans! What's (bleep) wrong with you? Get your (bleep) fingers out! Where's your bottle (bleep) gone? And can you (bleep) pay attention when I'm (bleep) talking to you? If you don't want to wear the shirt, take it off... there's (bleep) thousands of kids out there who'd (bleep) die to put that (bleep) shirt on! (bleep) get back on the field, show them what you can (bleep) do or (bleep) off home on the (bleep) plane! Have you got that? England lose 4-nil. Mike... it's the worst game of football I've ever seen in my life. Oh, come on. What about the game we played against the Belgium 6 months ago? No, no, it was worse than that. There was no skill, no shots, no passing, no one twos, no inspiration. There was just no ideas. Well, what about the set piece plays? There were none of them either. Mike, you've got 3 days till we play Argentina. Do you think you can win that game? Well, I don't want to predict that. Well, why not? You're the England manager. I know, but obviously I want them to win, but I can't say if they will or-or not. You don't think we can beat Argentina. I can't say, can I? I mean, what do you bloody think? Well, you're the England manager, Mike, not me. I know, but you're asking me to predict the future, so I'm asking you. It's not for me to say, is it? No, come on now, smartarse, you put your bloody neck on the line. Can we beat them, yes or no? No, we can't. And what do you think? No, I don't. Think we can win, Tommo? It's not gonna happen, Mike. And what about you two? No, I don't. There you go, see? You've all made your own bloody mind up, so what the hell are you asking me for? You wankers. You can't say that, Mike. Mike... Mike...? Did you get that? With just two nights to go before England's last group game Bassett tries to get some much needed sleep. Oh, fuck that! Oh, no, no, no, that's not coming anywhere near me! Get the fuck away. Oh, how, lads! All these slags are blokes! Go on, out, lady-boy, out! Hey--hey it's four o'clock in the morning, what's going on? Er, nothing, boss. I was just, er, just sleepwalking. Have you had anyone in your room? Oh, course I haven't, boss. I've never even. I've never seen that fella before in me life. You're dropped. Oh, no. Oh, don't drop us, boss. Oh, please don't drop us! No, please, don't drop us! We want Bassett out. Yes, we want Bassett out. With his midfield maestro sidelined for at least one game Bassett calls his squad together in a bid to get the show back on the road. Look, I had to drop back 'cause kept missing your tackles. You try marking that Ramirez, he'd shit all over you. I didn't understand the 3-2-1-2-1-1 system. Where was I supposed to be playing? [cell phone rings] Will you fuck off! Right. That's the honest points out of the way, so let's talk through the positive points, shall we? Okay, Doddsy. Well, er-- on the positive side them Mexicans were bloody brilliant, weren't they? Yeah, I'll tell you what, if that Ramirez doesn't win player of the tournament then there's no justice. Hey, three cheers for Ramirez. Hip hip. Hooray! Hip hip. Hooray! Shut up! You're cheering the bloody Mexicans? We're England! Yeah, all right, all right, keep your hair on, Mike. Keep me hair on? Bloody hell, the newspapers are calling me a twat, the wife's about to leave me we're gonna get knocked out the bloody World Cup and you're singing three cheers for Ramirez'! It's a wonder I've got any bloody hair left! No need to take that attitude. I'm going out of my mind here, lad, and what are you doing to help me apart from locking all the bloody footballs in the Opel? You got a bit of resentment there, Mike? Might as well get it off your chest. I think I will as a matter of fact, thank you very much. See, you, you're just a waste of space. That's how you feel, is it? Yeah, and I'll tell you something else, you're a small-minded bigot. Is there anything else in the locker there, Mike? Well, just the one. You know that bloody Daewoo car you sold me? Well it's an absolute fucking disgrace! Right, that's it. Lonnie Urquart is sacked with immediate effect... I don't fucking need this. Leaving Bassett without an assistant manager and a nose broken in two places. With just one day to go before the final group match Bassett's plans are in tatters. Look, um-- I'm sorry I let you down. That's okay, son. Forget about it. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Hey, how about I get you a drink, huh? Put a smile back on your face. Best not to. I'm on the anti-depressants. Oh, go on. A couple of sharpeners won't do you any harm, will it? Come on, just a little one, huh? Suppose one will be all right. Er, por favor. Yes? Two pints of lager and a pair of flaming zambuccas--please. Yes. [music playing] [whistles] Eh-up, boss, get it off. Get it off! Oh Christ, put it back on! Oh, boss, boss-- It's Pele! [foreign language] Hey, Pele, you were the greatest striker in the history of football and you still missed a bloody sitter there in the World Cup in 1970. [foreign language] You were only three foot out. Bloody headed it and Banksy tipped it over the bloody bar. Take a tip from me it's all about upper body strength. On me head, not off me head. Not off me head, not on me head. Not off me head, not on me head. Not on me head, not off me head. Where's your adventure? What the hell do you think you're doing, Mike? Get down at once. Come on, Geoffrey! This is a red card offense, Mike. Come on, get down. Geoffrey. Come on, come on, get down. Come on. They think it's all over- It is now! The England manager Mike Bassett, has been caught on film in a bizarre incident at the team's hotel-- And it's clowns. This time it's the turn of Mike Bassett, head coach of the English team caught downtown in a Brazilian bar with a bellyful of liquor-- It's an absolute disgrace. He's supposed to be the England manager. [foreign language] Bassett has shot himself in the foot. The storm clouds begin to gather above Rio... and the tabloid press sharpen their knives. Do you think this is the end for Mike Bassett? I don't know. When the fat lady sings, they... they pull the curtain down. They get the fat lady off the stage. What do you think your dad would say if he was here now? I don't know. [knocking on door] Press are waiting for you, Mike. Yeah. Thank you, thanks. Er... ladies and gentlemen, I've had a... long, hard think about the events of the last few days... and I've had to make one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make in my life. Um, er, I've decided to... carry on as the England manager. Oh no, you cannot be serious. Mike, come on, you have to realize, the situation, it's completely untenable. No, that's not necessarily so. I've had a word with the appropriate bodies and, er, told them how very, very sorry I am. Mike, if one of your players acted in the same way, he'd be on the next plane home and you know it. Yeah, at least. Yeah, but I've been on anti-depressants... and along with some lagers and a few zambucca chasers... tia maria and the odd glass of wine, you know... Mike--Mike, surely it's time to step down. No, not at all. I've, I've had, er... I've had words with Mr.--Mr. Lightfoot and he's, he's behind me all the way. Can you tell us what words? Thanks, mate. Geoffrey Lightfoot doesn't want you. You know, the team doesn't want you... the fans don't want you... We don't want you. Yeah. Mike, even your wife's left you. It's not as if you've got anything keeping you here, have you? You know, time to pick up your coat, I think. We'll have a whip round for the plane fare. Yeah, for Mr. Bassett. Look, in God's name, just go, eh? It's finished, it's over, isn't it? [indistinct] Just go. [indistinct] If you can keep your head when all about you men are losing theirs and blaming it on you... You're a waste of space. If you can trust yourself-- when all men doubt you. And make allowance for their doubting, too. If you can dream and not make dreams your master. if you can think and not make thoughts your aim. if you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same. If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools. Or watch the things you've gave your life to broken. And stoop and build them up with worn-out tools. If you can make one heap of all your winnings. And risk it on one turn of pitch and toss... I love you, boss. And lose, and start again at your beginnings. And never breathe a word about your loss. If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew to serve your turn long after they are gone. And so hold on when there is nothing in you except the will which says to them-- "hold on." If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings nor lose the common touch. If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you. And all men count with you but none too much. If you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run, yours is the Earth... and everything that's in it, and which is more, you'll be a man-- my son. Ladies and gentlemen... England will be playing 4-4-fucking-2. Apologies to our viewers for the colorful choice of language there. Geoffrey. Football as you know is a, a passionate sport where profanity and expletives... Jason. Though never condoned, are nonetheless commonplace. I love you. The Romanians are at it. So are the Swedes. Darlean on the end of this. What about the Nigerians? This lad can really move. And they've equalized! His football's not bad either. Here come the Italians. These two go together like Spaghetti and Bolognese. Mouth watering. Incredible! They did it in '74. They did it in '78. Can they do it again? Yup, looks like the Scots are going out in the First Round. But what about England? They have to beat the old enemy Argentina to stay in the tournament. Games just don't come any bigger than this. Well, I counted them all out and I counted them all back. What's your reaction? Let's rejoice at that news. England! ♪ When two tribes go to war ♪ ♪ Point is all that ♪ ♪ you can score ♪ ♪ Score no more ♪ ♪ score no more ♪ ♪ When two tribes go to war ♪ ♪ Point is all that you can ♪ ♪ score ♪ ♪ Working for the black gas ♪ ♪ Cowboy number one ♪ ♪ A born again poor man's son ♪ You know him better than anybody probably. Do you back him to score, quickly, yes or no? Yes. Oh, he missed it! No. Argentina go through... and England go out! It's a fluke that we got here in the first place and I just think that, you know, he's shaming us in front of the world. And can we beat Argentina? I tell you what, if we beat Argentina, how about I chuck my job in, I'll become a dustman. England versus Argentina. Could this be Bassett's last game in charge? With Gary Wackett in jail, Bassett gives the captain's armband to Alan "Skipper" Massey. Lead them out, Skips. Finally, he has his nickname. Come on, Skipper. Go on, Skipper. Go on, Skipper. Go on, Skipper. Come on, Skipper. Come on, Skipper. Come on, lads, let's go, let's go! [cheers and applauds] [fireworks popping] This is it, boss. This is it. Come on, boys, just play the system. Listen up, lads. System, come on. Come on, come on! Referee! Go on, lads! Linesman! Keep going. Keep that going. Oh! Oh! England take the game to Argentina. It's a classic confrontation where one slip-up could decide the match. With five minutes left to play, the score remains firmly deadlocked. Final substitution. Hey, 13 off, 10 on. You still got it, Tonka? Aye, I've got it, boss-- It's in me pocket. Well, take it out your pocket and put it on the pitch. I love you, boss. Well, there's some activity down, er, in the England dugout. And maybe this is the last roll of the dice for Mike Bassett. Oh, no, no, no. Some of you... see this fellow as a talisman for England, Kevin Tonkinson. Go on, Tonka, lad. It's time for Tonka. It's just the last act of a desperate man. [foreign language] Come on, boys-- the last five. Go for it! Deano, give it to Tonka. It's still nil-nil... and Tonkinson is on now and he gets the ball from Savigar's throw. And that's a brilliant turn. Do a Maradona, son. Come on, do a Maradona. And it's still Tonkinson. Good lad, Tonka. Good. Hold it, hold it, Tonka. He's taking Argentina on. He's passed Bastardo. Come on, Tonk. Come on, Tonk. Come on, Tonk. Go on, Tonk. Out comes-- Goooooaaaallllllll! What a wonderful goal! Let's see it again. Tonka one on one with Bastardo. Round him like he wasn't there. Chips the keeper. Back off the bar. And look at that. Fantastic header. Hint of a handball there, Martin. Against Argentina? No chance. [cheers and applauds] Yeah, Tonka, my son! The game represented a glorious vindication of Bassett's 4-4-2 system... Mike! Mike! And a triumph of faith in the face of adversity. Look-- Mike! Hey-- boss-- boss... where are you going? I'm gonna phone the wife. Following their remarkable victory over Argentina... England progress to the knockout stage of the tournament... successfully seeing off Romania and former champions France in the following rounds. England were eventually knocked out in the Semi-Finals by the host nation Brazil who went on to lift the Cup. But for Bassett, the great Brazilian adventure was over. Oh, no, not really superstitious, I just promised Doddsy that if we got through the qualifying rounds, I, er... I wouldn't shave... you know, like Boris Becker did, you know. Right. Sorry, Mike, just a quick question. You got us to the, the World Cup Semi-Finals. How does it feel? Well, we gave it our best shot. Didn't we, Doddsy? Oh, aye, boss, best shot. No question. But I have to accept that I failed. You know, I... I, I promised all them people in England I'd be bringing the World Cup home and I've, er-- I've let them all down. But don't you think you're being a bit harsh on yourself? I mean, you've equaled our best performance since we won the World Cup in 1966. Yeah, but that's not good enough for our country that. No, no. I've had my turn and... maybe it's time to move over and leave it to a younger man or, I don't know, even one of these foreign coaches, you know. So, what does the future hold for Mike Bassett? I'm gonna consult with the family and I'm not getting any younger, maybe it's... maybe it's time to retire, you know. I have been called the last great footballing dinosaur so maybe I should just gracefully sort of... Become extinct. Yeah, yeah. Thanks, Doddsy. Um, how do you feel now that the... Okay.
