Calm down! Where's the interpreter? The interpreter, dammit! We're the Narc Squad. You're under arrest for dealing. You can see a doctor, inform the family, and see a lawyer. MAMA WEED PARIS POLICE HEADQUARTERS Ok, for the last time, where'd you get the 7 kgs of hash? He says, "Fuck you. Where's my lawyer?" Watch your language with the interpreter. Show some respect! Stay polite. Now quit fucking with us! Where'd you get the 7 kgs we found at the hotel? Traitor bitch! What the hell? Keep him warm in solitary. You ok, Patience? - I'm fine. You look peaked. I've had it. Sure, you work round the clock. It's not work, it's existential. I worry about my future. I'll take care of you, we'll travel, you'll take up Japanese ceramics. Japanese ceramics? Thanks. Any better ideas? - Ready for this? My, my! I liked your old office better. Less showy. I'm glad you're pleased about my promotion. Of course I'm delighted for you, Chief. So, about the Abdelaziz family recordings, what do you think? - I found... some amusing stuff. Look. Where'd you get that? - Facebook. I like to know who I listen to. Next trip, we're arresting them. Don't get attached. By the way, I still have my two small fry. Scotch and Cocoa Puff. The two nitwits you stuck me with. You forgot already? - How could I? They're champion idiots. Are they still trying to score dope? - Yep. Those two knuckleheads aren't priority. Take your time. By the way, thanks. For what? For using taxpayer money to help me out. Just joking. Almond Tree - Assisted Living Turkey with mixed vegetables. Looks good. Know why we named you Patience? No idea. I carried you 10 months. - I know, Mom. And Daddy wanted a boy. You were huge. 5 kgs, a monster. And ugly! Half your head crushed by forceps... Mom, I've had an awful day. So much blood it was like I'd stepped on a mine. Come on, eat! - No! I don't like it. I don't like this hotel room! I want out of this nuthouse. Where's the dog? - Here's the dog! It's snowing and Schnooky's out. Get him in. There's no dog outside. This is no hotel. An old folks' home costing me 3,200 euros a month! You've always been cruel to animals. I'm going out for air. Khadija, please come feed her. I'm getting nowhere. Right after I put Mrs. Léger to bed. Out of my way. I'm late. I'm expected at Chanel! Off we go. Did she eat? - She did fine. She was always in her own world. All she did was doll herself up, read novels and smoke menthols. Gallia Menthols. Everything else passed her by: her house, her husband, even me. You needn't come so often, Mrs. Portefeux. I take good care of your mother. No one should have to live through this. Not her, or me. Not even you. Why not me? I like my old folks. And with us, she's easy. We call her "the princess." Never a dull moment as a child, eh? All those beautiful places she took you to! Miami, Venice, Switzerland... It entertains us. It'll be alright. It makes me sick... Cocoa Puff: "It makes me sick, man. Keeps me awake at night. "He pulled a fast one on me with the sample, "the sonofabitch." It's me! - I'm in here. Mrs. Fo gave me the mail. What's she doing with my mail again? Your ironing's on the bed. Take your sister's, too. - I don't believe it! She had my blue top! No bag? - In your wardrobe. "A big finger "up your ass." How elegant. "And you wind up "society's grade-A asshole. I say "hamdullah if you ever get your bills back." How do you say "up your ass" in Arabic? So who are these poets? Scotch and Cocoa Puff. Two dealers with bad hash. They're losing customers. It's suffocating in here. - Don't. I can't stand their screeching! Ok, I'm off. Are you ok, Mom? Yeah... But I was thinking... I went to the tax office to pay the last of Dad's fines. So you're all paid up? I thought I'd feel relieved, but not at all. It made me really sad. That crook left you with 20 years of debt. Hortense, don't talk about your father like that! You can't imagine the wonderful times we shared all those years. Try to enjoy the present. Upcoming Auction Patience? - Yes, it's me. Did I wake you? Afid: "Houria, I can't sleep." Houria: "Why not?" "I looked at you so much today that my eyes are filled with light. "It's like daylight in my room." Conversation of no relevance to the current investigation. Once the hash lands in Spain, Afid, the nephew, brings the load to Paris. By go-fast? - No, go-slow, in his produce truck. He rigged it with a false bottom. He has a diploma in vehicle body design, top of the class. Got any nutmeg? That's all I have. Here. The dope goes straight from producer to consumer, like organic veggies for yuppies. It's funny... It's as if you were making excuses for them. I just like it when life finds its path. What's that mean? Like my parents. When my dad came from Algeria in '62 and met my mother, he stole sugar from cafés. To eat. They didn't have a cent. When I say nothing, I mean not a penny. So their life took a path... a path, let's say... What? ...that a cop wouldn't have approved of. Breakfast is ready. Auction House Mrs. Portefeux. Hello. - We're short on staff. I need a solution for your mother. A hospital geriatric ward is more affordable. She'll be transferred next month. You're booting her because I owe 2 months? Clearly you can't afford extra help. Please, Mrs. Portefeux. Kindly clear out her room when she goes. Getting rid of her just like that? Like a piece of old furniture? It's revolting! Wasn't that taken on Lake Geneva on Daddy's boat? I remember that photo well, but it's the girl who ferried the money. The little girl is me! I ferried your money into Switzerland. In a big stuffed dog. A basset hound. What was his name? Pompidou. - Yes! Good for you! Pompidou. Dinnertime! I didn't survive the death camps to eat that shit! I want to dine out. Come on now. I'm a princess! I want a coke. - Afterward. Go on, I can take over. Have you seen Mrs. Léger? Sorry, I have to go. Someone saw her across the street. Not again! Mrs. Fo, I know I have no say, but when will they fix the elevator? Me wait for good quote. Good news. Better than basement strong rooms... That we have to pay for! It'll go like this: the goods leave Morocco tomorrow, and should arrive here the next day. Any idea how much? A lot more than usual. They need help loading the truck in Spain. This time the hash must be excellent. They say they can get 5,000 euros/kg. Sounds like a very big haul. We'll catch 'em in the act and lock 'em up! Thanks. That's sweet. I can't wait to wrap up this case so we can get away together. Like that mid-August long weekend. What are you doing next vacation? I usually just go to Muscat for a week, but with my mother and all... You go to Oman every year? My husband's buried there. Sorry, I had no idea. No problem. I went last year just before we met. You never told me. What did he do? Business? Not the sort of business you'd have approved, but it gave us a very nice life. He was sitting across from me, after a boat ride, we were having lunch... and he died. Face down in his plate. A stroke over a Caesar salad. He was 34. I'm sorry, I didn't know. It's ok. That day I realized your life can capsize in a second. Is that you in the picture on Grandpa's boat? What a glamor girl! Why'd you buy it? It's by a famous photographer. I was glamorous, wasn't I? How much was it? 5,000 and some. You paid 5,000 for a vacation pic? So what? If it makes her happy. Exactly. It does make me happy. How'll you pay for Grandma's care? We'll see. We sure can't help. We can hardly pay our rent. Hortense, I didn't ask you! And stop acting like I'm nuts. My only luxury lately is a home where your grandma isn't tortured. He must be on the boat between Morocco and Spain. Where? - About to land. It's Morocco! - Patience! The uncle is asking for news. Afid says that he's made it to the beach in Spain. Here we go. I want a dog, but my place is tiny. That's ok. What dogs want is to be with their master. They don't need space. Want me to reserve him? You seem to get along. - He's not yours? He belongs to the K9 unit. After 9 years, they get retired to a shelter. Then what? If no one takes them, they're put down. That's horrible! - Here's the shelter. There are lots up for adoption. Under the picture is their résumé, their area of expertise. "Drug and currency detector." He's cute. Patience! - I'll take it. Hi, Imma. - Where are you, son? It's his mother. She's worried. Afid just passed Hendaye. Got him? - I can't find him. Welcome, Afid. Freddo, put the tail on him. It's Freddo. Go for it. It's dangerous to drive with no sleep. I napped on the boat. Where are you? - At work. They stuck me on night shift. Mrs. Léger, a woman on my floor, got loose. The manager blamed me. What's the matter? - My legs are asleep. Are you ok? - I'm alright. Why do you stay at that place? I don't want to go home to wait on your uncle. You buzzed? What year are we? He thinks I'm his maid. No way! I'll stay here with my old folks. What you want for dinner? I'm craving chicken chorba. Alright, but drive carefully. Don't worry, Imma. Don't fret. Conversation of no relevance to the current investigation Did he say anything about quantities? Afid just asked his mother to make him chicken chorba. Chorba make you ill? You're pale. Can Reda replace me? I need some sleep before questioning. Thanks, Reda. I'll be right back. Wait for me. Where's Khadija? - She's in the nurses' room. Hello, Mrs. Portefeux. Stay where you are. I have to talk to you. You may not know, but I work for the police. I translate people on wiretaps. Your son's name is Afid, right? He's driving hash up to Paris. So do exactly as I say. And after that? - After that... I'll tell you. Alright. It'll all work out, Khadija. Hi, Reda. - You ok? I'm fine. I'll take over. You sure? - Yes. Why'd you come back so soon? You could have slept more. Couldn't sleep a wink. I wanted to be with you for the arrest. Not to bid farewell to your dear Moroccan family? Almond Tree Afid's mother. I got it. Hello? - Afid? Shut up and listen: a lady from the police I know very well says that if you don't do what I say, you'll go to jail and so will I. That lady is at the police station listening, so I can talk. What're they saying? She's worried about his new girlfriend, Houria. She looks skinny in the pictures. She hopes she's not ill. A real Jewish mama. Afid! Ditch your cell phone, now! Don't cry, Mama, please. May Allah protect you. Fuck! Why's he taking the exit? Shit! Mika, find that truck. Let's hit the wholesalers. Let's go. Move it! This is Afid's cell. Leave a message. Where the fuck are you? I've waited an hour. Call back. Voice mail. Get back! We're unloading! The undercarriage. Nobody move. Come on, faster! Come on, dogs. Do your stuff. You got a way out: Cracker Jack's expecting a delivery. No time. Lots of ass-lickers are lined up, but I'm waiting for you. Easy, brother. This stresses me out too. Sure it does, you moron. Dis his ma, dis his grandma, dis whoever you want. But get the show on the road! Action-reaction! Don't cry to me over your spilled milk. Move! Could you sign the wiretap affidavits? Stop jerking me around about the truck. Take him away. What the fuck? It's cool. You're in for it, sonofabitch, if we don't get our stuff! We'll go see your mother... She'll hear about it. We'll go see your mother. Cherkaoui, in my office! Chief... Do you need me? - No, they all speak French. Go get some sleep. Was that Afid in your office? I have to get back. Sorry. Patience... I'll be over as soon as I can. You ok? My first mission as Chief... I sure fucked it up. - It's not your fault. Afid must have spotted the tail and ditched the goods. Will you let him go? - With the miles of wiretap we've got? He'll get at least a year, in solitary. Or through the grapevine, his Moroccan pals will clobber him. Good luck, sweetheart. "Sweetheart"? - It just came out. See you later. Hi, Mom. How much was in the truck? A whole lot! He was carrying our stuff and the neighbors', the Cherkaouis. If the police find it first, we're all dead. I saw them at the station. Tough customers. Who's dead? - Nobody, Mom. I'll explain. No one will find anything. The police or the Cherkaouis. Only Afid knows where it is. I told him time and again his uncle was up to no good. He'll go to prison. Who's going to prison? - No one, Mom. I knew it'd end badly. People never listen to women. Quiet, Mom! Please, not now. Khadija, there's a lot of dope out there somewhere. We have to get our hands on it. I can help you. Mother, please! You? Help with the hashish? Yes, me. That way, you can get Afid a good lawyer. And I need money. Talk to my brother. I never wanted to get involved. You can't call him. Your line is tapped. No problem. Afid taught me, so we could talk without the police hearing. Mohamed? - Yeah, what? I'll put the police lady on. Go on, he can hear you. I press here? - Yes, with that hand. With both? - No, first... That's you. That's me, and that's him? I get it. Why'd you make Afid dump the goods? You got us knee-deep in shit! That's him talking? Otherwise the cops would have it by now. Who asked you? It's none of your business! Listen up. I can locate the dope and put it in a safe place. We give back what's not yours. And the rest... Hello? He can't hear. - Keep pressing that. Right. - And the rest... I know two guys who're dry. They'd be takers. What d'you know? - You know better? You just got nabbed like kids. Why am I even talking to you! Fuck you. What a jackass! I know. Khadija, we'll manage. But we have to act fast. The Cherkaouis could get out tomorrow. Then you're in danger. You've got to go somewhere. Thanks again for warning us. You've done lots for my mother and me. We're decent folk, ma'am, not crooks. I wanted my son to stay out of this. Everyone wants an easier life. Wait. This'll suit you. Thank you. See you soon. - Be careful. Afid got off the A6 here. His phone stopped pinging here. Two hours later, we nabbed him at the tollgate. When he saw he was being tailed, he must have handed the dope off to another vehicle. He sure bamboozled us. The timing may be wrong, but did you know that police dogs are put to sleep if no one adopts them? Look. Help me rescue one of them. That one. He's smiling at me. Ok, DNA, show me your stuff. Beat it, mutt! Get outta here, I swear! Good dog. Let's see. Route A6, exit 14, Ury. Where'd he stash it all? You're not here to drink, lazybones. Where's the man's hash, DNA? Fetch! What the... Good dog, DNA. How'll I move all that? We didn't give up We got the job done We didn't give up We got the job done We're gonna celebrate, celebrate, celebrate Mrs. Fo, it's nice to have a working elevator! I'll unload this and send it back down. For the basement, actually, high security is great! Shit! A ton and a half. Here you go. 1,200 bills per minute. Long battery life. It all comes to 610 euros. No credit cards. I don't have 610 euros in cash. Sorry, only cash, Mrs. Portefeux. - You know my name? We live in Aunt Colette's building. - Who's Aunt Colette? Hi. - Hello. I'll take your card. You will? How do you change the language? Let's see. What language do you want? - Arabic. Party's over, brother, we're up the creek. Only poor man's weed. Nothing else. Whaddya mean? You look, find nothing? You say nada on your end? It pisses me off. I'm looking but there's nada. Talk in Arabic, dammit! If it's to give me bad news, shut it. I swear, it busts my balls and... Hang on a sec. What is this shit? What the hell? Hey, boss. - Yeah? Can you read what it says? I don't get it. "Due to arrival from back home, "selling 1/2 meter of hash for 250. "Meet at Hotel Peninsula, Etoile, 5 p.m. "with sample." - Serious? That's what it says. Na! - It does. Hello? Dude, gotta haul ass. Hard timz iz done gone! Crossover hijab... Just what I need. Hard timz iz done gone. Hello, I'm Mrs. Ben Barka. I contacted you. I have goods from back home to sell. Here's a sample. It's 4,500/kg for top-quality stuff. If you take more than 50 kg, I'll give you a discount. How much? Sell 10-gram bars for 60, that's a 75,000 profit. The money up front. If a single bill is missing, the deal's off. Ok? You have my number. What is more? More is more. Lots more. First let's see how it goes. 225,000 at the Fleury parking lot. When you have the money, let me know. The prison parking lot? Of course. Did you expect to trade in your living room? Don't forget, always Arabic on the phone. I swear on my mother's head, this is some boss weed. Two tokes and I'm out! Ever see that? I got grasshoppers jumping on my head. It smells like the earth back home! Two kebabs, boss. Make it three. And a coke, please. Whenever she wants! I'd work forever with that weird chick! I don't even care if she's FBI or what! Gimme lettuce and tomatoes, no onions. On my mother's head! Go for it, on my mother's head. She's got some presidential shit! On my mother's head, she's got some presidential shit! It's nice to have satisfied customers! It's impossible! The ton of hash in that van didn't just evaporate. Philippe's pissed. No, it's just a work issue. He's tense. I'll call you back. He's still a looker. You're lucky to hook a nice guy like him. What do you mean? - Mom... 20 years a widow. Let someone into your life. Can't I mope in peace? I've only known him a year. He can be nice, but he's a real cop too. What's this one? - An Allosaurus. Cretaceous period. North America and Europe. An expert! - I want to be a paleontologist. Like a treasure hunter. An Allosaurus can sell for over a million. See, it's not a dumb job. Who knows why he loves dinosaurs. He never watched cartoons. My daughters never missed an episode of Denver. Denver, the last dinosaur He's my friend and so much more I loved it. Lucky Luke for me. A faster shot than his shadow. I wanted to be a sheriff. That's so sweet. Look. Isn't this an Allosaurus? - Yes. None the wiser. Cute Allosaurus. Did you buy it? What do I owe you? - We stole it. What? - No cashier. You can't just help yourself! What a killjoy! What does this crap made by underpaid Asians cost? Two euros! I raise my son as I want. Paul, come on! Such honesty is a real problem, don't you think? Taxi! Careful, it's heavy. You said it. Where to? Fleury prison. A relative inside? - Yes. The Prophet said... "The greater the hardship, the greater the reward." Here she comes. No small bills. Only 100s and 200s. Money is money. Shit, it's money! - Watch your tone! 10s, 20s and 50s are for small fry. Say if you are. I can't waste time. We're not. Ok, I have 112,500. You only get one bag. I'll take the 500 50-euro bills today, but never again. This is crap. We want to count it too. Fine by me. We said one bag today. What's this? - A special treat. I threw in an extra kilo. I have 20-kilo Moroccan suitcases. Handier for wholesale. Shit, cops. Close that up fast. Hello. It's best if things go smoothly between us, right? Yeah. Good evening. The money for the building fees. Sorry, it's in cash. Cash very good. One quarter, plus the 22,000 euros I owed for the work on the basement. Nice job down there! Your name is Colette? I'm Patience. I know, I manage building. You only non-Wenzhou left. I know well you. Yes, that's true. Talk doesn't cook rice. Good night. Talk doesn't cook rice. There, October and November. I've added December and January to pay overtime under the table. Your Chinese shareholders will be happy. I nearly forgot. I've hired extra help for my mother. Thank you for your trust. It's my father's gun, DNA. In three days? No, that's too late! I don't give a damn. Work it out. Tomorrow. Yes, tomorrow. Tomorrow, same place. Don't be small fry. Two cases, the rest in bulk. So... Two cases, the rest in bulk. Tomorrow, same place. Don't be small fry. She said that in French. Don't be small fry. Only 100- and 200-euro bills. But where? The same place? A woman is dealing tons of hash in Paris and we can't catch her? Play it again, please. She has... She has an accent. An accent from... the west of Algeria, near Oran. No accent for "small fry." Typical of Oran, a port city. Thanks, Patience. Thanks for the geography lesson. Goddammit! Colette! Do you have a minute? Alright. I wanted to talk about something a bit... Let me explain... Here goes. I... I thought of selling my place. I don't know if you're interested, but... I'd like to inflate the official selling price. I'll give you the difference in cash. Plus a commission. Have I made myself understood? Yes, you have much cash. Launder money by selling apartment. Good idea. Yes, that's it. 30% commission. Money laundering... is 20%. Not 30%. Hard work making money vanish. 30%. 30% is a lot, though. Let's say the apartment is worth 540 grand. I give you 300 in cash, you buy it for 750 and you keep 90. Is that it? If we agree, can you launder more? I need to house my daughters, you see. Children very important. Thank you, Colette. It's good we talked. Goodbye. Goodbye. Like me, only Chinese. Don't you agree? What's all this? What are these new lines? - Your pals. Scotch and Cocoa Puff. They need cash. Their supplier's on their back, 50 kg a time. They're working hard. Do they even sleep? You don't have all of them. 80% of the calls are in French. This is new. Very beautiful. What is it? It's a photo called "The Little Fireworks Collector." Meaning? It means an endless summer. If you collect fireworks, you begin in Sydney on January 1st and you follow the sun around the world, all year. You circle the globe like surfers do. It's funny... With your headphones on, when you translate, it's as if you're not here. You're elsewhere. Not here, not with me. Is that what you dream of? Maybe. I don't know. What do you dream of? - I'm more down to earth. I dream of a quiet life where I take it easy. With someone else, if possible. Once you know where they'll meet Mama Weed, call me. They're getting on my tits. Mama Weed? - The old lady. That's what they call her. Mama Weed? What kind of name is that? Maybe she's not an old lady. Maybe she is... a mother, or a dignified woman. A woman over thirty. Your work's cut out. Catching your Mama Weed will be tough. Maybe she lives nearby. She may use burners, but always calls Scotch from near here. Crazy! Maybe I'll run into her at the market. She's not in my building. They're all Chinese. We put a tracker on the clowns' car. They'll lead us to her and we'll net them all in one go. Trust me. Bye. You'll see if you net your Mama Weed. What's the sauce? Spicy, like yours, stupid. She's here. Stop eating. Hello. Eat less and lose the fat. It's not fat, it's muscle. Can we talk? Now she talks French? I don't get it. You and your pal are slaving away, but you need to move faster. Seriously, you're pushing it. We shift 30 fanny packs an hour. I know, it's a lot of work. You look worn out. It's all too much pressure. I know why they call you Scotch. Because... I stick like glue? - No, you hang on. You're a winner. Yeah, that's me. See, I know you well. From now on, we do things differently. Small amounts at a time like ants, so the police don't get wise. Yes... Mom, get some paper towels for home. Get some dish liquid. - I do the dishes. And fabric softener, too. Let's go. Good evening. How are you? What? - You're such a paradox. You seem so frail, as light as a feather, yet your self-confidence impresses me. You remind me of guys I've put away. Is that a compliment? - I only have compliments for you. Here. No, it's terrible. Do you have any real champagne? Will Taittinger rosé do? - Perfect. What a snob. I don't compromise on quality. I skimp, but get my clothes cleaned. I'm not in jeans and fleece like your team. Shall we dance? Mika, come and dance. No, it's not a rock number. Move it! Get lost! C'mere. Who filled your pack? - No idea. No idea? Don't make me. In the hut there! What're you staring at, fucker? Move! You know me? - Shut up! This is ours. Shut the door. C'mon, hurry it up. After that, I studied Arabic at university. Then I did a PhD. Still on Mama Weed's wiretap? Not at all. I was telling him how I ended up translating the drivel of two-bit dealers... for the cops. Fascinating. All that to send kids to jail to get radicalized. For 3 grams of hash. But this time we're onto an ambitious lady with a hash start-up. I'll let you discuss the serious stuff. I don't know if it's female solidarity but I'm beginning to like Mama Weed. I'm busting my ass to catch her and you're starting to like her? At times, you don't seem to care. About what? - About me, all this... Our little spat is over. I need you. Coming? I don't understand. Cut it out, I know you speak French. What's that? - A puzzle. Of hash. Patience, can you come? Can you ask him where he's from? He's from Libya. Wazin, near Tunisia. They hire migrants now? Can't this wait? I don't feel well. I don't feel well. Who messed you up like this? You're pissing me off! What'd he say? Moroccans beat him up to get his supplier's name. And we don't get to know? What did he say? He said... he can't remember his name. He thinks he's called Scotch. Know why they beat you up? The hash you sell belongs to them and someone stole it. Translate. Not your pal Scotch. He's too dumb for that. Translate. Another question. Translate, please. Have you ever seen or heard of a Moroccan woman called Mama Weed? - I'm going to faint... Open up! Open up! Open up! It's not locked. The handle just jams. Calm down. You need to ease off. Your blood pressure's low. Locking people in... Prison is horrible. How can you do this job? It's atrocious. Take time off, get a change of scene. I have to run. I've loads of stuff to do. Bye. I have imperatives. I need to reduce stock. Start taking big deliveries again. One meter minimum. Know Tati lingerie? Look out! Got you, bastard. No. No? - I'll find it. Find it. It's in Barbès. Be there at 5. Don't be late. I won't wait. And don't come by car. Ok? Not by car. I'll be there, but I want it at 3,500 the half-meter. - 3,500?! You think you're hot stuff. 3,500 for a meter. Two Moroccan cases and 10 kg in bulk. That's 350,000 euros. If you can count. Look out behind you! He's dead. For you, Mika. Philippe, a new report. Scotch's phone. Is it for Patience? No, let her get some rest. What does he say here? "A fucking sniper iced me. "Too busy to wait for next game." She's got them on video games. Is that it? No, he adds, "5:30, Tati lingerie, "not 5." Come on, then, you charmer. Wait with the dog and my bags. I won't be long. - I'm no locker. Or a dog-sitter. Pay and get out. And take your couscous pot. Ok. Asshole. Stake out. Scotch, where are you? I said not by car! Didn't you get my text? What text? You idiots! It's crawling with cops thanks to you. I'll wait at the Louxor cinema. Come and meet me now. Your dog drools and sheds everywhere! He can't stay in my cab. I'm taking him. But you stay here. Don't move. Come on, boy. Why yell in Arabic? Don't you speak French anymore? Ever think you could be bugged? Why do we use your dumb games? Ok, I want my meter now. I'm not stupid! That bag's empty. Relax, it's coming. I don't do credit, ok? Where the hell is he? Hurry it up! Be right there. I don't like liars. - Oh, yeah? You're the Liar Queen! Who are you anyway? You're not Moroccan! Who needs who here? Screw this. I'll use the competition. I didn't say that.
