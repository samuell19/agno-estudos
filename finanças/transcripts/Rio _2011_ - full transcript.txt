Call so clear we can sing to Sun and nature's big moon Dance to the music Passion and love Show us the best you can do! Everyone here is on fire Get up and join in the fun Dance with a stranger Romance and danger Magic can happen For real in Rio All by itself! You can't see it coming You can't find it anywhere else! lt's real in Rio And know something else You can't feel it happening You can't feel it all by yourself! lt's okay. lt's okay. l'll take care of you. Stupid clock. Good morning, Blu. Come here! Tyler Blu Gunderson! You know these vitamins are good for you. What's this? Gotcha! Enjoy the new book! Thanks, Linda! Bye, now. Yes, Mom, l'd love to visit, but who would take care of Blu? Mom! They don't have kennels for parrots. Here's your hot chocolate, Blu! Just how you like it. Plus, l don't trust leaving Blu with just anyone. No, l don't have a bird-sitter. This is the life. The perfect marshmallow-to-cocoa ratio. One, two, three, four, five, six. Well, well, if it isn't my favorite nerd bird. Very funny. Real mature. Hey, pet! Where you migrating to this year? The breakfast nook? Throw all the snowballs you want. l'm protected by this magical force-field called glass. lt's what keeps us so toasty and warm in here while you guys are out there freezing your... Classy. Are you all right? l'm not really built for this weather. Are you looking for some books? Books? No. No. l have come 6,000 miles looking for him. Doctor of Ornithology? He's magnificent. Linda? Little help here. Linda! Wow! You're actually communicating. Yes! l introduced myself and shook my tail feathers counter-clockwise thus deferring to his dominance. l did not get that at all. So, Dr. Monteiro... No "Doctor," please, just call me Tulio. You know, your macaw is a very special bird. ln fact, as far as we know, Blu is the last male of his kind! Really? Yes, and recently, we found a female and our hope is to bring the two of them together to save their species. Well, yeah, sure, when can she come over? No, no. She is in Brazil. Blu must come to Rio de Janeiro. Rio? Brazil? No. No, no, no. l never let Blu out of my sight. He needs me. No. You misunderstand. lt's all arranged. You will be with him every step of the way. And l will be with you. Look, l know you're doing yourjob, but l can't... Well, Blu is very particular. And we have our little routine here and we're not big on travel. Heck, he doesn't even fly! But of course he can fly! He's a perfect specimen. What are you doing? Don't worry, their natural instincts always take over. Wait, wait, wait! No, no! Well, almost always. Blu! What kind of doctor are you? Are you okay? Perhaps, he's too domesticated. lt was very nice of you to stop in and squawk around and throw my bird. But now it's time for you to go. l'm very sorry. l'm very sorry, but... Wait, wait, Linda. Linda! This could be our last chance. Have a safe flight. Linda, please, listen to me. lf we don't do this, his whole species will be gone! Just think about it. Natural instincts! There is nothing natural about being thrown halfway across the room. Well, l'll show him. l can do this. l just have to work out the physics. l have quadrated my vector angles. l've adjusted for wind shear. Positive reinforcement. Good. Okay, let's see. Flaps open. Perfect. Landing gear. Check. Tail flaps. Operational. And, actually, not bad. This is it. Let's fly. Just keep it simple. Thrust, lift, drag and weight. Thrust, lift, drag, weight. Thrust, lift, drag... Wait! Blu? l promised l would always look out for you, didn't l? And have l ever broken a promise? l'm scared, too but l wouldn't make you do this if it wasn't the right thing to do. What do you say, Blu? That's my big, brave boy. And we'll be back home before we even know it. Your turn, Blu! You don't want to get beak-burn. Whoa! What is going on here? -You arrived in time for Carnaval! -Carnaval? Yes, it's the biggest party in the world. You know, a time to have fun and dance! Oh, my! ls she a performer? No, in fact, she's my dentist. Dr. Barbosa! Don't forget to floss, Tulio! You got it! Come tomorrow night, everyone will be dressed like that. Not me. Oh, right yeah. l am not from here. Hey, Nico, he's a tourist! Funny, you don't look like one. Really? l don't? Except you got pigeon doo-doo on your nose. Oh, no, this is just SPF 3000. So, are you here for Carnaval? Actually, l'm just here to meet a girl. -A girl! -Yes! Little word of advice, you make the first move. Brazilian ladies respond to confidence. Right. Yeah, it's all about swagger. You got to puff out that chest! Swing that tail! Eyes narrow, like some kind of crazy love-hawk! -But first we got to bust you out. -What? Yeah! l'm gonna pop that cage open like a soda can! No, no. Wait! No, no, no, that's okay. You call that popping? This thing is robust. No, no, guys, really, l'm fine. The cage is great. Love the cage! Suit yourself! Don't forget, love-hawk! Yes, yes, Bem... And to you, as well. This is the heart and soul of our aviary. Our treatment room. They really like you. A lot. Yes. l'm their great, big mama bird. Wow! Want some? l'm good. Many of the birds here were rescued from smugglers. Smugglers? Yes! And unfortunately, the poor birds are often hurt or even killed in the process. But with proper care, they can be saved. Look here. This poor guy was found last night. Hey, buddy! You're looking great today. Much better, much better! Get well soon! So, where is Jewel? We have a special place for Jewel. She's a very spirited bird. l'll say. She did that? Charming. Okay, l want to go home now. No, no. Don't worry. l'm going to make you look irresistible. Help! Help! Let me out of here! Linda! -Maybe l should... -No, no. Give it a chance. Hello? l come in peace. Whoa. She's beautiful. What were they talking about? She's like an angel. An angel who's getting really close... You're standing on my throat. You're an American. Thanks. l need my throat for talking. So, thank you. You look like me. Hi. Hi, my name is Blu. Like the cheese with the mold on it. You know, that smells really bad. That's stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Come on. We don't have much time. Wait, wait, wait. -Are you ready? -For what? Wow. Okay. Confidence. Crazy love-hawk. All right. Whoa, what are you doing? What? What you wanted me to. But just for argument's sake, what are you doing? l am trying to escape. Yeah, escape, that's where l was going with that thing l just did. Wait, wait. Did you actually think we were going to kiss? -No! lt's not what you think. -We just met. Oh, my. l think they need a little help. l know how my feathers look, but l am not that kind of bird. Okay, l had nothing to do with that. But, you have to admit it's actually a pretty good song. Naturally Yeah, sing it, Lionel. Wow. That was fast. Lionel Richie works every time. We should probably give them some privacy. l'm not so sure l should leave Blu here alone. No, don't worry. Sylvio will keep an eye on them all night. Besides, he's got Jewel. Help me! This is the final countdown to Carnaval! Let's samba! Come here, poor little birdie. lt's okay, l got you. l got you. Excuse me. Please, l am trying to sleep. l'm sorry, sleepy-head, l'm trying to escape. Escape? Why? This cage is awesome. This... What was l thinking? l wouldn't expect a pet to understand. Pet? Did you just call me a pet? For the record, l am not a pet. l am a companion. And you know what? Do whatever you want 'cause tomorrow morning, Linda will come for me and this whole nightmare will be over. lncredible! You would rather be with a human than with your own kind. Well, that human has given me love and affection for the past 1 5 years whereas my own kind try to strangle me after 1 5 seconds. Yeah, well, because of them, l've lost everything. You can't trust them. Of course... you can trust humans. Jewel? Jewel? Hi, there. lt was nice of you to join me for dinner. l often eat alone. Because, of course, my work. l thought l was the bird nut until l met you. Yes, right. Do you have a favorite bird? Well, obviously, l'm a blue macaw kind of gal. That makes sense. They are very handsome birds. Actually, it's the brains l'm more attracted to. l'm not so impressed by fancy feathers. l know exactly what you mean. My favorite bird is the spotted owl. l've always been mesmerized by those big... round, intelligent eyes. Chicken hearts? Chicken hearts! Oh, gosh. Hello? Oh, Blu. We should have never left Moose Lake. This is all my fault. No, no, Linda, Linda, please. This is not your fault. You're right. lt's not my fault. -lt's your fault! -What? With your little bird talk. And that whole "save the species." Well, you know what? Squawk, squawkity, squawk, squawk! l'm sorry. l didn't mean to curse. l don't understand. Sylvio is the best guard in the business. So, let me get this straight. You were attacked by a little white bird? Yes, with this rag. He held it to my mouth like this. We're doomed. Okay. There's no place like home, there's no place like home. How l wish l was back in my own cage with my mirror and my swing, and my little bell. How l miss my little bell. Play dead. What? l don't need to play dead, l'm about to have a heart attack. Just do it! Fine. Stop twitching. Come on, it's the twitching that sells it. Come on in, kid. Well, what do you know? Good work, Fernando. You see, boys? What did l tell you about this one? That you were going to pay him half as much as you said? No, you idiot. That he reminds me of myself when l was that age. Smart, resourceful. Here you go, kid. Hey. This is only half of what you promised me. Shut up, kid. What the... l thought l told you l needed these birds alive. Tell me, Fernando... does this look alive to you? Get her! Come over here! Jewel! Come here! Hello... pretty bird. What's the matter? Cockatoo got your throat? Nigel! Alive. To be continued. That was your plan? To take off and leave me? Gee, thanks. Well, why didn't you follow me? Nice work, Nigel. Yeah, nice work, Nigel. The last blue macaws on earth. These are worth a fortune. Hey, Fernando, hang these up in the other room. Hey, birdie! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out of here! Who's a pretty bird? l'm a pretty bird. Pretty bird, l'm a pretty bird. l'm a pretty bird. l was framed. They got the wrong guy. Sorry, guys. Nothing personal. So, what's going to happen to them? Don't worry, we're going to find good homes for them. Now go home to your mama. But l don't have a mama. Father? -Brother? -Goldfish? Can we keep him, boss? No. So, Marcel, what's really going to happen to those birds? Plucked, stuffed, eaten, who cares? All l know is we're going to be rich. We're gonna be rich! Come on, come on! The game is starting! Yes, you were very clear. Tomorrow or the deal is off. Of course l have both the macaws. Yes, l will deliver them myself. All right, you two... you load the truck tonight. And first thing in the morning, we bring those birds to the airport. You got it? -Yeah, sure. -All right. Heard you. And one of you, feed Nigel. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot! Yes! Nuh-uh, scissors cuts rock. Oh, man. How come you always win? Nice birdie. Here you go. Cannibal. Okay, pull it together. The key is not to panic. l'm not panicking. l wasn't talking to you, l was talking to me. But it's okay, because any minute now, Linda will find us. Great. And then she'll stick us behind another set of bars, right? Yeah. l mean, no. Look, pet, cages might work for you, but l don't want to belong to anyone. Something seems to be lodged in my beak. Would you mind? l know l'm not a pretty birdie... but l used to be quite a looker. A star. Lights, camera, action. l was striking, suave, ambitious. Feet to beak... so birdie-licious Now I'm viIe, I am viIIainous, and vicious Oh, and malicious l had it all A TV show, women, too l was tall Over one-foot-two Then they got a pretty parakeet to fill my shoes That's why l am so evil, why l do what l do. He was a super star So young and vital He's nasty A South American ldol He's a suspicious bird Who said that about me? -A very vicious bird -l'll have you rotisseried l'm a feathery freak With a beak A bird murderer You think you're badder than me? l never heard of ya I'm eviI, l'll fill your cheese balls with weevils l poop on people and l blame it on seagulls lt was him. -He's a nasty bird -l'm invincible -He's ghastly -l'm un-mince-able I'm unwashabIe, unrinseabIe Like an abandoned school l have no principle All of you Brazilian birds All 80 million birds l'll tell you what l'm going to do l'm going to make you Shut up, now. Shut up! lt's just me. l will make you ugly... ...too. Hey! Sweet nightmares. Not cool, man! Scary, but not cool! Hey, are you okay? No, l am definitely not okay! Wait. What are you doing? Getting out of here. Are you going to help me or what? Actually, all the survival guides say to sit and wait, and help will come. No one is coming! We are on our own and if we just sit here, we're going to die! Yes! Yes! Yes! No! Nigel! Get out of the way! Hold on! Stop! Stop! Why don't you just open the door? Are you kidding me? What? lt's just a standard flip slide bolt. Come on! Let's fly! What are you doing? -l can't. -What? You can't what? l can't fly! You couldn't tell me this before now? lt didn't matter before now! l hate you. ls there anything else l need to know? Yes, l can't fly, l pick my beak, and once in a while l pee in the bird-bath. Happy? There they are! We got to get out of here! Just move! Move! Wait, wait. Listen to me. Flying may not be my thing, but walking is. Follow my lead. lnside leg, outside leg. Yeah, okay, l got it. lnside, outside, inside, outside! Yes! Yes! Yes! -Yes. Yes! -Come on! See? l'm bilingual, too! This is great! l'm chained to the only bird in the world who can't fly! Actually, there are about 40 species of flightless birds. -Duck! -No, ducks can fly. No! Duck! Yes! Hold on! No! Get out of here, you putrid poultry! What was that? A stick. And that? lt's just a rock. Right. Yeah. ls that a spider on my back? Will you quit it? lt's just a leaf. Turn around. Leaf. Told you. Now, come on, we need to find a safe place to spend the night. Safe? Safe? We are in the jungle. You know when people say, "lt's a jungle out there"? Well, l'm pretty sure they don't mean it as a good thing. Look, l hate to break it to you, but this is where our kind naturally lives. Hey, don't talk to me about nature. I watch Animal Planet. l know all about the food chain. You see? Out here, l'm just an hors d'oeuvre. Nothing more than a feathery spring roll. That is why we stay in the trees and not on the ground. After you. No, l don't think so. No. l would feel much more comfortable in something man-made. Hey, how about up there? l can't believe l have to drag your clumsy butt up there. Drag me? Watch and learn. Blu! Just wait one... Blu? Who's dragging whose butt now? Very funny. You see? Who needs flying? Birds. Birds need flying. Flying is... lt's freedom and not having to rely on anyone. Don't you want that? l don't know. lt sounds a little lonely. Let's get some sleep. l'm probably going to be up for a little while. Because l'm still on Minnesota time. Good night. Good night, Jewel. Good night, Linda. Excuse me, sir? Have you seen my bird? Excuse me? Have you seen my bird? Have you seen my bird? Blue feather. Lady! American lady! -Blu? -Where? Wow. l know where your birds are. You found Blu? Are you sure? lt's his! Let me see that. You're right. Okay. Where is he? Come on, let's go! l'll take you to him. No, no. Linda, wait. We don't know this boy. We can't trust him. l have to trust him. l don't have a choice. Do you think l'm an idiot? They were two birds chained together in a cage. How could you lose them? They outsmarted us, boss. But don't worry, we'll get them back. l have a plan. Great. What are you going to do? Wander the city calling "Here birdie, birdie. Here birdie"? Well, anything sounds dumb when you say it like that. Okay. We have to get the birds to the airport tonight. But it's Carnaval. All the roads will be blocked by the parade. And that's why l wanted to go this morning. Nigel. This bird is 1 0 times smarter than the two of you combined. Yeah, well, if he's so smart, then why don't you put him in charge? l am putting him in charge. Stop suggesting things. Go find them, Nigel. lf we can't get through the parade, we'll have to be in the parade. Are you sure this is going to work? Positive. Check out my math. Yeah, that's comforting. Thank you. Look, let's just get this chain broken. Right. Then we can go and find Linda. No, you can go find Linda. Once this chain is off, l'm going to go back to being free in the jungle. Deal? Fine. Deal. Nice try, brainiac. l think something is watching us. Be careful, Blu. They might snuggle you to death. Come here. lntruders! Cut it out! Now stop... No! Don't! Attack! Help! What's going on down there? Go, go. Off with you. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! l've told you a thousand times. Manoela, Sofia, come on now, listen to me. Oh, yeah, right in the eye. Precious, aren't they? Kids? Seventeen of them and one on the way. Hey! He's not a maraca, stop shaking him! They're giving me gray feathers. This papa needs a break. So, you two lovebirds headed for Carnaval? -Lovebirds? -We're more like acquaintance-birds. Not even that, we're more like chained-to-each-other birds. Yeah. l mean, if... What is it with this kid and the feathers? We have no idea. We're having him tested. So, do you think you could help us get this thing off? Lucky for you, you know Rafael, and Rafael knows everyone. Again with the eye. Okay, want me to call your mother? No! Works every time. They're scared to death of her. Call me for what? Eva, my love... l must take this young couple to see Luiz. Luiz! You don't fool me for a second. You and your amigo just want to sneak off to Carnaval. Carnaval. That magical time when l met the most beautiful bird in the world. l still remember the song that was playing when l first laid eyes on you. Tall and tan and young and lovely The girl from lpanema goes walking Come on, baby, sing it! And when she passes, each one she passes goes, ah! Like a river of the sweetest honey. l guess love is deaf, too. Come here. Okay. Take them to Luiz, but hurry back. You are an angel. l'll miss you my juicy little mango. l'll miss you my pudgy papaya. Hey! Marco! Carlos! Put your brother down, now! l can't believe she actually let me go. So, how far is this Luiz? Not far. Thirty minutes as the crow flies. And how long as the macaw walks? -Bobo here can't fly. -But he's a bird. Not all birds fly. There are ostriches... You're not an ostrich. -Not technically, but... -Wait. My friends, l want to help, but to walk the whole way... lt can't be done! Where's Daddy? -Daddy? Daddy? -Come over here. Go back to your room. But, hey. We might as well give it a shot. Let's go quickly. No, don't look back. They sense fear. What an adorable monkey. Hey! My watch! Hello, boys. Seems like you've had a busy day. What? This? This is just some stuff we found. Right, boys? -Yeah. -Yeah. l'm not interested in your nicked knick-knacks. Your burgled baubles bore me. There are two blue macaws out there and l need your multitude of eyes to help me find them. Yeah? What's in it for us? Well, that's a fair question. Let's discuss it. l certainly see your point, but what could l possibly do for you in return? Save me! Save me! Well, that's a thought. Yeah. But is it enough? l don't want to feel like l'm cheating you. Help me! Help me! No, no! We'll do it, we'll do it. Save me, please. Save me! All right, you've twisted my wing. Deal. Now then? Any more questions? No? Good. You will spread out and you will find these macaws by the end of the day or it's flying lessons for everyone! Go! Go do your monkey business. l've changed my mind, yeah. Maybe we can find a bus schedule or something. Come on, you're not going to back out now. Not in front of the lady. Okay, yeah. Yeah, sure. All right, that's the spirit. You're sure you're up for this? Yeah, yeah. l mean, it's not like we're just hurling ourselves off a mountain or something. Right? Actually that was pretty much my entire plan. What? Don't worry, Blu, it's in your DNA. And if our featherless friends can do it, how hard can it be? Wait, wait! Mommy! Fun, right? Yeah. Fun. Okay. l need you two to get closer. Closer. Nice. Now put your wings around each other. -What? -Come on, amigo! lt's not like she's going to bite! Will you? We'll see. Now, you flap your right wing, you flap your left wing, and together you fly. But this doesn't seem aerodynamically possible. You think too much. Flying is not what you think up here, it's what you feel in here. And when you feel the rhythm of your heart, it's like samba. You fly! See? lt's easy! Easy? Easy for you to say, because from here it looks really, really hard. Hey, if you want to see Linda again, this is the only way. Okay. You're right. -Yes, l am. -This is for Linda. -Right. -Keep it simple. -Easy breezy. -Thrust, lift, drag... -Come on! Let's go! -Wait! -lnside, outside, inside, outside. -lnside, outside, inside, outside. Come on, Blu! You can do it! l can do it. l can do it. l can do it. l can't do it! Not again! -Am l dead? -No! We're still alive! Wow! This is incredible. Wow. This is the most beautiful thing l've ever seen. See what you've been missing? Yeah. All right, Blu, you're flying! Sort of. Not really, but do you feel it? Yes! l do feel it. No, no, Blu! Wait! Sorry, sorry, sorry. We're gonna die! You did not feel it in here. You think? Let's catch a ride to Luiz. Hurry, you two! Okay. Last of the species here. Move it! Hey. Wait up. Come on, lovebirds! You made it. l would love to go five minutes without almost getting killed. ls that too much to ask? For a bird who can't fly, yeah. They're starting to close off the streets for Carnaval. You better be right, kid. Because we're running out of time. l'll never be able to get my car through this crowd. Don't worry, l'm on it. Watch it! Hey, kid, how did you get this bike? -l traded it for your Jeep. -What? Yeah, it's in great condition. Well, good condition! Hey! Out of the way! Look out! Hold on! l'm going to chew through my own leg if this doesn't come off soon. Relax. lf l know Luiz, we're right where we want to be. Hey! Rafi! lf it isn't the king of Carnaval! Nico! Pedro! What up, family? Where you been hiding yourself, bird? Man, l thought you were dead. Hold up! Rewind. Ain't that the bird from the cage? l think our love lessons went down smooth. You work fast. Baby got beak. You was locked up and now you're rolling with a hot-wing. l want to be like you. No, it's not what you think. We're just chained together. Hey, l'm not judging you. -Keep it spicy. -Oh, yeah. Hey, guys, we're looking for Luiz. Have you seen him? Yeah, l seen him, but you didn't, because you just missed him. He took the trolley back to the garage. Great. Relax, baby bird. You could catch the next one. Yeah, it's time to take it to the next level. What's wrong with this level? Come on! This ain't the level. The next level's the level. You got to shake your tail feathers. We got to get this chain off first. Come on, lovebirds! You're in Rio! You should enjoy it! Yeah! Live a little. We got them. Hey! Welcome to paradise! Some party, huh? This is the coolest place l've ever seen. Despite all the obvious health code violations. l like you! Nothing you say makes any sense. All right, everyone, listen up! Rafi has some special guests from out of town and let's show them some love, because l don't think they get out much. Everybody put their wings together and clap them as loud as you can. Flap them. Clap them. l don't care, slap them. Party in the lpanema, baby. l wanna party l wanna samba l wanna party -And live my life -My life -l wanna party -Party And fly High! l'm gonna fly Fly just like a bird But you are a bird Oh, yeah, you're right So let me fly just like a rocket then -Okay -Fly so high Where l need to come down for oxygen 'Cause once we start it Baby, ain't no, ain't no stopping then 'Cause l just want to live my life and party All l want is to be free And rock my body Okay l've been around the world And l want to live my life in Rio 'Cause l Rio, 'cause l Rio realize What are you doing? l don't know.

Yeah, little King Kong. l don't know what's going on here. Birds versus monkeys! Get them! Yippee-kai-yay, monkey man! Yee-haw! Giddy-up! Missed! We got to go! Need a lift? Take that, you funky monkey! -Thank you! -Anytime! That's what l'm talking about! Man, we threw down! Yeah, we threw down. You guys were like fire and ice. -Thunder and lightning! -Hip and hop! Cheese and sprinkles! lt's a Minnesota thing. You see? Nothing you say makes any sense. Come on, follow me. What? But the birds were here. Yeah, sure they were, kid. l swear, the birds were right here. -Well, how do you know? -Because l'm... l'm the one who took them. You! l didn't want to hurt anybody, l needed the money. But Fernando, l trusted you! l know, but... Man, that's good. Hey, guys. What are you doing here? l just wanted to see if you had any work for me. Well, if you were here two hours ago, you could've helped us load the... -What? -Shut up. So, why are you guys dressed for Carnaval? So no one will notice us when we smuggle these... Shut up! We made a float. A float! So you guys are going to the parade. Can l come? l'm a great dancer. Can he come? Come on, please. Three is better than two. Fine. We got to hurry though. l almost forgot. Where did l put it? l thought it was right here. There it is. Got it. Let's go. Hurry up, kid. Can he ride on the plane with us, too? Shut up! No. We can't let them get on that plane. You can drive a motorcycle, right? You insult me. No, l can't drive a motorcycle. lt's just like riding a snowmobile. What happened? Papa? What happened? Oh, no! Let me go. Stop your chirping and talk to me! No, no. l don't know anything. Help! When l bite down on your head, will it go "pop," or will it go "crack"? Where are the cerulean birds? That means blue, by the way. They escaped. Went to Luiz. Anything else? They said you were very nice. Did they? Liar. And handsome, too. Never send a monkey to do a bird's job. Don't worry. l got it. There he goes. That's my boy. ls it hot? l think l'm sweating. l didn't even think that was biologically possible, and yet, look. Wow. Yeah, that's your boy, all right. Okay, so he needs a little help. Come on, let's give him some. Set the mood. All right, look, l'm on it. l know how to set the mood. Check it out. Get a, Get a, Get a Get a girl Get, Get, Get Get a girl Take her, take her to the fIoor Show her, show her how you roll Drop it, drop it, drop it low Drop it low, drop-drop it low What kind of mood is that? Pedro, Pedro, a little too aggressive. l'm not hating on your creativity, but l think l got this one. Follow my lead. Now, that's more like it. Wasn't really thinking Wasn't looking Wasn't searching for an answer ln the moonlight When l saw your face Wow! What a beautiful sunset. Yeah. Blu. Down here. Just tell her, "You have beautiful eyes." That's good. Great idea. l have beautiful eyes. Yeah, okay. Sure, they're nice. No, her eyes. Her eyes. Right, yeah.

And then Jewel was there, and he snatched Jewel up. Like, he snatched her up. And then he was like, "You're coming with me, you little princess." And Jewel was like, "l ain't your princess, leave me alone." -And l was like, "What?" -Then he was like, "What?" Stop! Just tell me what happened. He got Jewel, man!
