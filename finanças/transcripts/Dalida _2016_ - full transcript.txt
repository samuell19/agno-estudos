February 26, 1967 Bruno, it's important. I must see Luigi's family. Don't go alone. Rosy should go with you. She's my cousin, not my bodyguard. It's not a problem. She'll keep you company. I must see Luigi's family. I'll be back tomorrow. - You want to go alone? - Yes. - You're sure? - Yes. OK, as you wish. Take care. Have a good trip. Thank you. Good evening. Hotel Prince de Galles, please. Dalida attempted suicide last night in her hotel room. The singer was found by hotel staff... The singer's action could be linked to the suicide of her lover, Luigi Tenco, one month ago. Luigi, do you mind waiting for me? I'll wait for you here. Two months earlier I have a booking. Iolanda Gigliotti. Very good. Room 76, third floor. Tell me something. Something? I don't know. Tell me about Heidegger. How about him? The "being-toward-death". You make a fine student, Gigliotti! You deserve a prize. Come here. To be human is to being alive while going to death. Like a tightrope walker. Balancing between life and death so as not to fall. I don't agree with Heidegger. - Really? - No. The main thing is being-toward-love. No, leave the light on. Why? I am scared of the dark. I'll protect you, angel. She shouldn't have been left alone. I'm her big brother, I should protect her. Don't worry, it's not your fault. Bruno, here's the doctor. Well, can we see her? She's out of danger but that doesn't mean she's alive. But she's out of the woods... physically? Physically, yes. Mentally, I'm less optimistic. Meaning? She needs specialist care to rekindle a zest for life. We may need your help to understand her action. We'll have to transfer her. There are some excellent places near Paris. I'll give you a list. Excuse me. And we still can't see her? We have a protocol for suicide attempts. Avoidance of those who remind her of the past. They're the ones who have kept her going. That's the problem. What was your relationship with her? Before or after the divorce? I don't know. How about when you met? We met at a contest I held at the Olympia. "Tomorrow's Chart Toppers" it was called. April 9, 1956. There was Bruno Coquatrix, Eddie Barclay and me. Who wants to stay in today? Let's go racing at Longchamp! It's my radio station that's holding the contest. Your listeners won't know! If we find any stars, you'll sign them up! We haven't before. Why now? I've an idea. If I win at 421, we go. You won't win. You can't gamble on this. We can. We can. I'll go first. Her voice recalls the Italian sun. Can she make a name for herself? It's up to you. Miss... Dalida! Love me Love me, my love Listen to my prayer You who are everything to me Hold me gently in your arms Don't leave me alone You do not have the right Without you I am but a lonely child Just a child, lonely and forgotten Love me I need you so much My life would be worthless If you didn't love me From then on, I was obsessed by finding her the best song so she could become the best. And she did. Mr Barclay will see you now. Do come in! Welcome. Lucien. We loved your performance. You're very talented and we'd like to offer you a contract. Heavy eyes, sad expression, You can't sleep You're just a shadow of yourself You roam the streets alone... To Bambino! And every night You wait beneath her window I know you adore her Bambino, Bambino And she has pretty eyes... But you're still too young Bambino, Bambino To play lovers' games Bambino Strum away on your mandolin My little bambino All the way from Egypt, Miss Dalida! Dalida and her terrific "Bambino". An excellent composition, "Bambino"! A bewitching voice! To our great friend, Dalida! An Italian girl from Cairo... Song Oscars 1961 You've become France's most popular star. "Come Prima" by its creator, Dalida. How do you explain your success? It's all about work. I work very hard. That leaves me with... "TAGGI". - What's that? - You don't know? Taggi is a type of trouser. You've never heard of it? I swear it's true. Why would I make it up? It's taggi. - The whole country is wondering. - Wondering what? When's the wedding? This isn't the time, Dali. Why not? Because... how can I say it? A wedding takes a lot of planning. That's why I'm asking. Find a date, then. You're always touring. My fault? Sorry for making your dream come true. My dream is to have a child with my husband. Stars don't have babies. It ruins the myth. We've got our whole life for that. Not when you're a woman. We'll do it. No, wait. I've only just divorced. Look at this wonderful career we're building together. It's a bit like our baby. I'm tired. The lights hurt my eyes every night. I know you're tired, darling. But we have 9 songs in this year's charts. That's a world first. We have to think of that now. What's the matter? Do you ever see me as a woman? - Just as a woman, I mean? - Of course, darling. You know I love you. But your love story is with the public too. And with you. With you first. I want to make you dinner, have a child, be a normal woman. Normal women dream of being you. And I dream of being like them. She and Lucien waited too long. They should have married sooner. It was so important to her. It is to any woman. Dalida is not just any woman. No. She is extraordinarily beautiful in the sense she's no ordinary beauty. You see? When she was young, she was different. Cairo - Autumn 1933 She remained in the dark for 40 days. She damaged her eyes by trying to look through her bandages. Only my father's music could soothe her. She didn't like herself in glasses. Cairo - Spring 1940 Four eyes! You're ugly! Four eyes! You're horrible and awful! She's someone who had to carve her own image. Stop! Come now, you little rascals! Go away! You'll all be punished. Come. Come along. Don't cry. The Lord is always on the side of the oppressed. The way people saw her was always... important. She was obsessed by that. The day she took off her glasses... it was like a rebirth for her. First Violin Look at the lovely dress Mommy made you. It's no use to me, I'm so ugly. Don't talk like that. I forbid you to say or even think that. You are the prettiest of girls. You look fantastic, my love. Your brother must have forgotten his keys. Pietro Gigliotti? Yes, that's me. Why? I've done nothing. I don't know what's going on. I have nothing to do with this. I'm a musician! But I've done nothing. I'm a musician! What do you say, Mrs Morisse? I don't love you anymore. We're just close friends. Well? Long live the bride and groom! Please, Dalida, a kiss! This way! Just a smile! Champagne! You're very ungrateful! I had to insist on you seeing her. Is that so? Are we rewriting history? We let the dice decide! He owes us everything. Where is my wife? With her brother. What's wrong? You're sad. I'd have liked Mom to be here. This dress is sad too. No, the dress is fine. You're sure? If the dress is fine, then everything's fine. One month later - Cannes I had to insist on you coming. Now you're enjoying yourself! - Shame Lucien stayed in Paris. - He's working! What do you think we're doing? Working in Cannes! - Will you dance? - Never on rapid rhythm. I'm in no rush. It's not your lucky day. Come. You really are ravishing. My name is Jean Sobieski. And you? Me? Yes, you. You must have a name. Yes. My name is Iolanda. You're very beautiful, Iolanda. Where is your name from? Poland. My grandfather was the King of Poland. - Really? - Well, not since the revolution. A fallen prince. Even more inspiring. You're the inspiring one. Terribly inspiring. Jean Sobieski, Dalida's new love Is it true? Yes. Can't you be more discreet? We just got married. It's my lack of discretion that bothers you? Among other things. What do you want me to say? That you look silly with that flake? He's using your reputation. He doesn't care about fame. He's a Bohemian. A Bohemian! He's ruining your career. - Is this about my career again? - Beware. You can sink as quick as you rose. What I make, I can break. You didn't make me. The public did. They listen to my radio station. And your ballads are finished. What matters is the twist, rock 'n' roll. You're already square! - Square? - I could click my fingers and you'd vanish as fast as you came. Poor Lucien! You think I need you to exist? You can even keep the apartment. Do I eat it? It's al dente! That's not good for your voice. Yes, I know. I must give up. You must give up singing. Why? To become my muse. I am your muse. Place your bets. Seven, please. All bets are in. The house pays 17 and odd numbers. You know what I like here? The view? Try again. The Eiffel Tower? - Again? - I don't know. There's a studio for your painting. British lawyer Peter Benenson has founded a new movement to defend human rights called Amnesty International... - Tell me, what's the problem? - I'm speechless. Why? What's the problem? "Orlando"? You've taken your brother's name! I don't see the problem. - It's ridiculous. - What's ridiculous? - Trying to take his place. - Don't psychoanalyze. What bothers you? You take your brother's name and you sing like your sister. You think you're the center of the world. I'm a singer too. Stop it. Admit that I'm right. He can't impose his choices, like you. No one imposed me anything. - Did you choose "Dalida"? - Yes. Think of Orlando. He agreed. He said yes. Do as you wish, it's your Olympia. I can't stop you from putting on her concerts. She asked me. The public want her. Don't play at that with me. You're my friend. I can't betray you. You're my friend too. But I warn you: the radio won't play her songs or advertise the show. To us, she's finished. I'm not saying that because... You know I can be objective. What goes down well today? Rock. Twist. You know that. I agree with you. But how can I refuse her? I don't know. I'm at the Olympia for Dalida's first night. Some say it will be her last. Excuse me, sir, are you for or against Dalida? A woman who cheats shouldn't be allowed to sing. But you came. For my wife. We bought the tickets ages ago. I consider it shameful! These are the first impressions, and they're rather frosty. Sing with passion, as always. Lucien The plumbing in the bathroom is faulty. Are you OK? You need anything? Can you get rid of that? Is that a wreath? To the death of song, long live Edith Piaf Who put it there? What's going on here, François? I told everyone... Showtime in 10 minutes! Live from the Olympia... Do you think he'll come? Who? Sobieski? He's not in the dressing room or on the guest list. Tell me why, when a wife cheats, she leaves her husband? Nobody's perfect! This is Agathe. Charming. - I'm glad you're here. - Everyone's here. Vultures ready to pounce. I can't say I'm glad. - Where are we? - Right in front. Good seats. See you later. Go on, my love. Don't lose heart. I didn't know why I was living I didn't know what use I was Now, now I know My eyes were made to gaze at you My lips to give you kisses My ear to count your heartbeats My hands to grasp and hold your warmth And since then I feel alive Because I love you And since then I feel alive I feel alive because I love you Because I love you Because I love you Because I love you And you love me Fantastic! Absolutely fantastic. Champagne? You were great. Thank you. That day she realized she loved us both. That was her schizophrenic side. - In what way? - In a manner of speaking. There was Iolanda, who loved me, and Dalida, who loved Lucien. Did you feel hurt? That hairstyle suits you. Thank you. You like it? I brought your contract renewal. Ten years, already. Time flies. What did you want to tell me? We've talked it over, Bruno and I, and... I think that the situation is somewhat absurd. I've worked here for ages, looking after artists. But Dali has been left alone to manage her career. So... In fact... we're going to set up our own production company. I'll put this away, then. It's the first time a woman has left me. This calls for a drink. - I'm not leaving my friend. - I know. Well, what are your plans? San Remo. - The festival? - Yes. She'll be mentoring an Italian singer called Luigi Tenco. She has real potential in Italy. It'd be a shame to lose an audience. We have to go for it. I don't see what you'll gain, but you must listen to your... producer. That's right. Yes. If I hadn't arranged the meeting with Luigi... we wouldn't be here now. It was her path through life. You couldn't intervene. I don't agree with Heidegger. - Really? - No. The main thing is being-toward-love. I like your sense of philosophy, Gigliotti. It's all thanks to you, professor. I love you. Calm down, please. Why did a star like you agree to come to San Remo? For Luigi Tenco's songs. You think Luigi Tenco can win? - Of course. - He can win. Thank you, all of you. I like Ornella Vanoni's song. It'd make a good cover. Can't you see they're using us? It's a commercial operation. He follows you everywhere. - Who? - You know. Yes, with pleasure. Let's do the photos, then she has to get changed. Don't drink too much, darling. You know why I stay here? For you. Dali, the festival director wants to meet you. We're very honored to have you at our festival. Good evening. We have a photo call. It's best to do them now. - With Luigi. - No, just you. - First... - Go ahead. Yes, separately is better. Let's go. It's my great pleasure to present the 17th edition... Luigi, will you be OK? - Yes. - You'll be fine. Let's hear Ciao Amore Ciao, written and sung by Luigi Tenco. - You're nervous. - I'm OK. Don't worry. You'll win. I hope so. Are you all happy now? What a farce! - Let me go. - Please. Your affair must remain a secret. It's your turn now. I can't. Yes, you can. Go for it. Sing. Go sing to them. Your song is fabulous. It'll be better next time. For you. I've been in contests... I don't give a damn about contests! These people know nothing about music nor why they're there. It's a game to them, you see? A game! But not to me. Slow down, Luigi. Please slow down. It's not a game. Please, Luigi! I'm not coming. I'm tired. Don't give them that satisfaction. Come. Come on. Wake up! I did not do it because I'm fed up with life but as a protest against an ignorant public. Murderers! No! That's enough. Leave me alone. That's enough! I can't carry on... Stop it! They barred me from going to his funeral. Scared I'd make a scene. They wanted to protect you. They failed. I understand your pain, but... But what? I'm 34, no love, no hope, no children... You give hope to thousands. And who gives it to me? You know the hardest thing when you're between life and death? No. To choose life. Death is sweet. And yet... you chose life. No. Death turned me down. My story is the story of a love My lament is the aching of two hearts A romance like many others That could be yours Wherever you come from My story is the story we all know It's a game played by lovers the world over Whether naïve or calculating It's the only song that's never-ending "I am nothing" It's the story of a love Why are you here? I want to introduce someone. No, wait. Surprise! As I couldn't introduce him earlier... How wonderful! Won't you take him? He's your nephew. He looks like you. Go to your aunt. And if you agree, he'll be your godson. If I agree? Of course I agree. In his auntie's arms. He's a cherub. He's gorgeous. Isn't he! You organized that? Are you glad? Little angel. It's your aunt! What's his name? Luigi, but if you don't like it he has a second name. What do you think? What do I think? That life goes on. Rome - October 1967 It's your first time in Italy since San Remo. Excited? Very. What do you expect from the Partitissima contest? - To win for Luigi. - Thank you. - Glad to be back in Italy? - Very. What's your message to your fans? Hello, Italy and Rome! Thank you. I'm a fan of Tenco. Can I meet you in private? Tenco's poetry. Pardon? - No, the book is for you. - For me? Come with me. Don't bring up her recent tragedy, OK? Yes. Please come in. - Was he nice to you? - Yes. Thank you, Mario. Coffee? No thanks. Was Mario OK? He's very protective. Yes, he certainly is. So you like poetry? Yes. I study literature and philosophy. Actually, I had to stop and get a job. I'd like to go back to it. My greatest regret is not having studied. You know... I understand what Tenco did. And what you did too. May I ask you something? Yes. Don't be so formal. OK. Wonderful! Maria Teresa, does this suit me? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Rosy, could you pass me... What a darling he is! It's lovely. Take it. It's your dog. Madam? Someone called Lucio. Do I let him in? We don't know him. Send him away. I'll go. - Who's Lucio? - I don't know. - How did you get here? - I hitch-hiked. - In this cold? - Yes. - I had to see you at Christmas. - You're crazy. Crazy about you. I've missed you. Same here. Come, I'll introduce you to my family. Take off your coat. Excuse me... This is Lucio. Have a seat. - Would you like to eat? - Yes, a snack. Happy Christmas! Can you explain? I can invite who I like. It doesn't look like he was invited. He's welcome. When we're gathered on Christmas Eve? He hitched across Italy and France. Can I send him away? We celebrate Christmas as a family, not with strangers. Respect your family, don't expose them to your... To my what? You know what I mean. If you don't like it, the door's open. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, everyone! What's going on? I want to stay here forever. You're gorgeous. He'd just turned eighteen He was as handsome as a child Strong as a man My life before you was never so beautiful. In 20 years you'll have changed your tune. You're the most beautiful woman in the world. From our very first meeting I'd have given anything To seduce him He'd just turned eighteen It made him almost insolent So sure was he And while he dressed Already beaten, I returned to my loneliness How I longed to make him stay Yet I let him walk away Without a sign "That wasn't bad" he confided With the infernal candor of youth I did my hair A touch more makeup on my eyes From force of habit I had simply forgotten That I was twice eighteen I'm pregnant. What? I'm pregnant. That's wonderful! By the young man? Yes. Very good. - He's 22. - So what? I'm 34. So what? I can't ruin his life. How would you ruin his life? By marrying a kid. Imagine the press. We don't care what the papers say. Who mentioned marriage? We'd look after him. Another grandson for Giuseppina. Mother mustn't know. Got that? Then we won't tell her. Don't you want a child? That's not the question. It's the only question. I need a father. For my son. Not necessarily. We grew up without one. You reckon? But we're here. I can help out too. It's not the life I dreamed of. Life isn't dreamed, it's lived. Quite the philosopher! Does the boy know? No? No. Will you tell him? Never. What will you do? Here... I don't know. I remember Several times not so long ago You told me how Everything would change How I would love To tell you what I have Inside of me When I'm alone The face of a child Always warms my heart Like the bells in spring My heart will ring It will ring It will sing It's such a shame I have never seen The love I can feel All around me How I would love To tell the world what I have Inside of me When I'm alone The face of a child Always warms my heart Like the bells in spring My heart will ring Lucio... I had to leave sooner than planned. Don't try to contact me again. I beg you, make my dream come true. Accept this money for your studies. Do it for me. I must find myself or I will lose myself again. India - Channa Ashram 1971 I'm going to stop singing. You seem much more serene. Much calmer. I've been through a lot of suffering. After my suicide attempt, I tried to understand. The other day I was with Lucien Morisse, my ex-husband. I said to him: You know me, you know my life. I've always gone from one man to another, but I was always looking for true love. I'm sure true love exists. It's a bigger love, one that leads to God. You still love her. What nonsense! - Do you love me? - Of course I do! Then stop gambling. - The bank called again. - I'll see to it. Really? - Tomorrow? - Please, I'm listening. ...Stronger than us. That's love. I'll sing "I am ill". That's madness, it's not you. It's what I've become. Your audience wants to dream, leave depression to others. He's not wrong. What my audience want is the truth. I always back you, but I don't buy it. Then rent us your hall. What? Rent us your hall. Dalida is the Olympia. She won't go elsewhere. I'd love you to play the Olympia but I'm a producer not a landlord. You're asking the impossible. Do you think that... this might make things... a little less impossible? What do you say? We can think about it. I no longer dream I no longer smoke And no more love affairs I am dirty without you I am ugly without you Like an orphan in a dormitory I no longer want to live my life My life stops when you leave I have no life And even my bed Turns into a waiting room When you go away I am ill Utterly ill Like when Mother went out at night Leaving me alone with my despair I am ill Totally ill You have taken all my songs Drained me of all my words Yet I did have talent Before the touch of your skin This love is killing me If this continues I'll die alone, by myself Near my radio Like some stupid kid Listening to my own voice sing I am ill Utterly ill Like when Mother went out at night Leaving me alone with my despair I am ill That's right, I am ill You have taken all my songs Drained me of all my words And my heart is completely ill Surrounded by barricades You hear me? I am ill Fantastic! I said you could sing ballads. You wouldn't believe me! I'm proud of you. Lucien too. He's with us, you know. With us! Listen... Listen! I do my best to be happy. But death prowls around me like a wild animal. When I was young, I wanted my father to die. When he returned from the camp, he was so wounded. Mentally and physically. He beat my brothers and me too. But it was when he hit my mother that I wanted him to die. And he died. I felt... guilty. Guilty. Same with Lucien and Luigi. With time With time, everything goes away The one we worshipped The one we looked for in the rain The one we'd sense With just a glance Between the lines, between the words Under the paint of a made-up oath Out for a night on the town With time Everything vanishes With time With time, everything goes away Even the nicest memories Can be tarnished by time I rummage about in the mall In the aisles of death Saturday night When tenderness takes its leave This "void"... What does it remind you of? Sundays. I always thought I'd die on a Sunday. We don't usually get to choose. Montmartre - 27 October 1972 Every Sunday... I invite friends for lunch so there's always a party. - Your pasta is excellent. - Thanks. It's a simple sauce. And your sitting room is totally transformed! Aren't you sick of that song? Stop it! You should be an actor, Pascal. Who is it? The Count of St Germain has arrived. Hurry! Hello. Darling, this is my friend Richard Chanfray. Count of St Germain. Delighted. - Who's he? - The alchemist from TV. - Transforming lead into gold. - Just wait till you see him! Fabulous! So you're immortal? A little like you? No, not like me. I'm not immortal. I was born 17,000 years ago. I'm from a different earthly vibration that allows me to travel through time. I believe lots of things, but that's a bit much. I don't ask you to believe me. I don't know what's happening to me tonight I see you as if for the first time More words, always words, the same words So you really turn lead to gold? Did you know that the root of gold is our, which means light? So amour means the soul that is drawn toward the light. You're a good talker, Mr. Alchemist. The time for dreaming is over Memories also fade When we forget them You are like the wind that makes violins play And takes away the rose's perfume Toffees, sweets, chocolates Sometimes, I don't understand you What do you say? Salute. ...Who loves the stars over the dunes Tender words wrapped in sweet talk Settle in my mouth But never in my heart Another word, just one Words, words, words Listen to me I beg you I swear Words and more words you scatter in the wind You're so beautiful. That's amazing. I never felt that before. You've been my wife through many lives. Aren't you tired of making love with me after all these lifetimes? Do I look like I am? No. It's an old song that I sing just for you Like a never-ending song of love It was sung in the streets Under faraway skies And throughout France We thought it long forgotten But here it comes again In another land that means "kiss me" I want to sing it with you my whole life through We ask from love Neither eternal oath Nor exotic scenery All that we need for love is a few words To go with the music I want to sing it with you my whole life through I love you. Dalida - Alain Delon The secret is out! "Dalida's love life has long shown eclecticism "and she has caught us out before. "Rumor or for real?" "Charmed by the exotic Dalida, Delon called her to his office..." Stop. You know it's not true. Come, my love. Stop it. Is it normal that people believe the Delon story? What people? What do you mean? The public, everyone. You do a record and a cover with him. You know how they are. Stop it, love. You know how much I love you. There is no love, only proof of love. What more do you want? Tell me what you want. I don't know. We could make a record together. But you're not a singer, darling. And Delon is? A quiet table by candlelight Two shadows huddled by the fire One cigarette after another A nightcap as the embers die And love, love, love Perfect! It's shit. - Bruno! - What? I want more volume. OK! A little louder. Something wrong? Stop it, please. What is it, my love? Tell me. Nothing. I really don't need pity. I don't care about this record, anyway. Richard, stop being a child. Stop it. I've put on weight. As I've not had my period I thought I might be pregnant. We can run some supplementary tests, but... But? You can't have children anymore. What? Your tubes were too damaged during your abortion. Ready, darling? Will you help me? Are you OK? Sure? You know what? We're going to do disco. What? We'll do disco. And you'll dance. At my age! It's the future. And the future is you. What did he say? He said I am the future! For sure! Look at this rain! Martine left the gate open? No, she took the weekend off. Stay here. If it's a burglar, I'll waste him. - Put that gun down! - Stay there! Richard, come back! Don't be afraid, Iolanda. Give me your hand. Don't be afraid. You can't leave me here. Pay my bail. I can't stay here. I swear I'll pay you back. But don't leave me here. I love you. Time's up! Put your hand here. Don't leave me. I love you. The trial of Richard Chanfray, alias Count St Germain, ended today: 1 year suspended sentence, and 118,000 Francs in damages, paid by his girlfriend Dalida to the victim, no longer in hospital. He was the maid's boyfriend. A diamond record. It's very heavy. Who'd have thought that Dalida could manage to win over the reputedly tough US audience... She sang in the showbiz capital... ...putting on a concert at the world-renowned Carnegie Hall. A worldwide hit, "Gigi L'Amoroso", sold more copies in Europe than Frank Sinatra's "Strangers in the Night". At 46, Dalida can still amaze us! Dalida celebrates 25 years of song with a US-style show. A career risk for an artist who has already sold 67 million records. Exclusively for us, here are the rehearsals for the show. Here's Dalida! Paris - December 1979 I am all sweaty! I believe a towel has been prepared for you. I feel privileged to witness rehearsals that promise an exceptional show. You've rehearsed for 10 weeks with Lester Wilson... Very good. The famous choreographer of "Saturday Night Fever". A show whose poster has already caused a stir. That's true. I'm from a very Catholic family. For me, it was very difficult to lose... how do you say? My modestness. We say modesty, but modestness is just fine! You look so young, I can't believe you've had a 20-year career. Worse, it's a quarter of a century! And it doesn't show at all! Blending "Bambino", "I am ill", and all your disco hits into one show is a heck of a challenge, confirming that no other vocal artist has so many strings to her bow. You recognize Mommy! Does it make you sad? I'm sad too. You've been drinking. Why do I drink? It's my fault? Of course it is. My star! You smell of Shalimar. Are you jealous now? I wouldn't look elsewhere if you didn't refuse. You disgust me. How can we carry on if we don't make love? How can I, when you behave like a child? I swear you'll end up begging me. You hear? - You will! - Let me go! With these two I can't. In Italy? What's the Italian for "ski"? In Italian it's scii. You tell her. - What? - To stop making herself vomit. I don't know what to say. - She's scared of getting fat. - Right. Same as ever! Cheers! To your success! To my brother Bruno, and everyone! To your show at the Palais des Sports! Happy new year! You're shouting. - Loudly. - So what? - You look stupid in that... - Don't touch. Aging stars can be so touchy! Get out. Of the restaurant, of my life, get out! Pardon? I don't think everybody heard you. Leave! Bruno. Don't get involved. Happy new year! I've had enough. - To the Palais des Sports! - Happy new year. It's over, Richard. Understand? - Calm down. - Just go. After all I've done for you? Please leave. We can't finish like this. Calm down. Hey! Calm down! Again. Calm down! Just stop it! You can't do this to me. I promise I'll behave. Stop it, dammit! Stop it! This is me here! Think you'll find anyone at your age? Go to hell! I live on love and dance I live as if I were on vacation I live as if I were eternal As if the news didn't bring the blues I live on love and laughter I live as if there were nothing to say I've lots of time to write my memoirs To tell my story in blue ink Let me dance Let me Let me be free to dance and sing All summer long Let me dance Let me Let me live out my dream I live on love and risk When I feel blue I flip the disc I come and go, I've learnt to live As if I were happy and free I live on love and laughter I live as if there were nothing to say I've lots of time to write my memoirs To tell my story in blue ink Let me dance Let me Let me be free to dance and sing All summer long Let me dance Let me Let me live out my dream 2 years later What shall I cook this evening? Some soup? An omelet? I'd just like some pasta. - Pasta. - That's right. - What, like yesterday? - Yes. Is she laughing? Maybe she's not that sick. Go and see. OK. - May I? - Yes. Watch this. How are you feeling? Well. I put on Louis de Funès, or she'd sleep all day long. And at night she's not at all well. She's very tired. That's normal, she only eats pasta. And she makes herself sick afterwards. I've had to take in all her dresses. The light hurts her eyes terribly. I've got it. She can't bear it anymore. Are you always here? Of course. She needs me every day. I think you should find a flat elsewhere. You can't stay here. Excuse me. Well, then... Can't we open the windows? It's lovely outside. No, thanks. My eyes are very sore. I've good news for you. Youssef Chahine is offering you the part in his film. That's good. But you need to get back in shape. Understand? We're in agreement? - We are. - Good. Cairo - shooting "The Sixth Day" - 1986 Someone in your life? Yes. What's his name? Michel. How old is Michel? Fifty. Wow! Your husband? That's not possible. I will make up for my death. Is it true you've already died once? Not quite. Is it scary? No. It's like a dream. We're late, Hassan. You have to come and get ready. How cheeky you are! A welcome worthy of a head of state was reserved for international singer Dalida, star of the hit film "The Sixth Day", directed by Youssef Chahine. What an idea of Chahine's, sending us this way! I wanted to see our house. I know, but we didn't need a convertible! Stop gesticulating! Calm down. Relax a little. It's wonderful. They're here for us. - Are you happy? - Yes. - You like music? - Yes. But I warn you, I don't want to hear you. Total silence when they practice. Alright? You'll eat when we get home. What are you doing here alone? I'm sorry, you could have called me. - How are you? - We could have eaten together. So you ate alone? You're mad. - Well? - Everything's fine. I talked to the producers of the musical "Cleopatra". It's all good. They assured me it's going ahead. - I'm glad. - Good. Want a cigarette? I have to stop. I don't care. I have something for you. Really? What's that? I made it myself. You made it yourself? It's fabulous. Gorgeous! It's beautiful. Well done! So you think of me. I always think of you, you know that. Shall we eat together tomorrow? Tomorrow I'm going to see a play with Michel. Oh yes, I'd forgotten. Good. So we'll meet for Sunday lunch. With pleasure. - As usual. - Yes. Can we get a glass of wine in here? - Graziano! - Be right with you. He's coming. Here. - I have to stop. - So you said. - I'm going to stop. - I know. Me too! - Is Michel picking you up? - Yes. Shall I wait? No need, thank you, Jacqueline. You're sure you don't want me to stay? No, he'll sleep over. OK. Have a nice evening! You too. Jacqueline, don't wake me in the morning. All right. So as not to live alone You live with a dog You live with roses Or with a cross So as not to live alone You invent a scenario You love a memory A shadow, anything So as not to live alone You live for the spring And when the spring is done Till the next springtime comes So as not to live alone I love and wait for you To have the illusion Of not living alone Of not living alone So as not to live alone Girls fall in love with girls And now we're seeing boys Marrying other boys So as not to live alone Others have children Children who are alone Like all children So as not to live alone We build cathedrals Where those who are alone Can hang on to their star So as not to live alone I love and wait for you To give the illusion Of not living alone So as not to live alone You find yourself some friends And invite them round When the boredom descends You live for your money For your dreams, your palaces But no one's ever made A two-seater casket So as not to live alone I live here with you I am alone with you You are alone with me So as not to live alone You live like those who want To give the illusion Of not living alone Life is unbearable Forgive me
