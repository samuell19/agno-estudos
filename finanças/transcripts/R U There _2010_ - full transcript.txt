Congratulations. That went well. Right? It went the way it was supposed to. Have you seen the others yet? Yes, I saw Paolo a minute ago. I haven't seen the others yet. It's that way. Damn it. Just a minute. Luc? This is not going into my system, no way. Didn't you see a sushi bar near here? Don't be such a pain, man. There's fruit too. I can't be gaming on just that all day. How does it feel? A lot better. The bus is leaving in ten minutes. And? It feels all right, I guess. Jitze? - Fuck off, man. - It's just a joke. Losing from a qualifier... What's going on? No idea. I just couldn't do it. It felt as if sometimes things froze up. Froze up? Are you sure? In that case I'll file a complaint. I don't know. My arm was bothering me again too. - I thought your arm was fine again. - It was. And now? What about the team match? What will you do about that? Fine. You're not playing until you've seen a doctor. Vlad will replace you today. - Is it me, or is it fucking hot here? - Not really. It's quite normal. - I'm sweating like mad. - Sorry, man. Will you be going to the fitness room? No, I'm going to bed soon. Maybe practice for an hour first. I feel a bit nauseous. Jitze? Come here for a sec. You'll be replaced by Vlad today. - Why did you say that? - What do you mean? In the dressing room. You told me I wasn't a pro in front of everyone. Why did you do that? - I think you got me wrong. - I hope so. Cuz if anyone on the team is a pro It's me. You know that as well as I do. Jitze. We're waiting for you. Sleep tight.
