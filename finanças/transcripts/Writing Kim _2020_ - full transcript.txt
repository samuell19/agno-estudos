(keys clicking) (upbeat music) - Hello. - Hi. - You ordered a man-servant? - Oh, shh, Mrs. MacKenzie will hear you. - Oh, she loves you. - Yeah. - And besides, I don't care who can hear me! - Okay, shh! I do! - You want it on the floor? - I needed the space for packing. - Beds are for suckers. - Okay, wait! Wait, mo. Just wait. - Don't go out west, Fievel. Stay here with me and the deflatable mattress. - The new tenants would be uncomfortable with that. But seriously, we have to be out of here in less than an hour. - Ah! Why can't you stay here? You can write anywhere. - I need inspiration! This is my first real-world adventure, traveling the west-coast. Writing when the muse strikes. Taking it a day at a time, going where the winds take me, it's no itinerary, just freedom! - I don't know what it is you're hoping to gain, I hear they're all a bunch of hippies out there. - Yeah, well, hippies sound good to me 'cause if I stick around here, my dad's gonna make become a lawyer or dental hygienist. - Lawyer doesn't sound so bad. - Just a little mouse looking for new opportunities. - Beware of traps set by smooth-talking cats. When are you coming back? - Oh, setting a return date just seems so final. - What am I taking? (upbeat music) ♪ Ah, ah, ah, ah ♪ ♪ Ah, ah, ah, ah ♪ - So, you've been here before? - Oh, no, I'm from out east. - How long are you out for? - I haven't actually decided yet. - [Driver] Free spirit, that's good. What are you gonna do while you're here? - I have some stuff, I think I'm gonna do some writing. - [Driver] Writing, what kinda writing? - It's just journaling, short stories, poetry. I know, nobody likes to read poetry anymore, but... - No, no, no, poetry is good. You gotta have poetry in your life, right? - Yeah. So, this is a nice car. - Yeah, it is nice, I just wish it was mine. Belongs to the Foster's and I just get to drive it, take people where they're going. (cathedral music) - [Student] Well, I'm just having a really hard time connecting to this character. - [Instructor] What don't you connect to? - Well, everything. I... It... Okay, she's married. Which I'm not even close. She cheated on her husband with his brother, which is something that I would never do. So... - Okay, great. I'm gonna stop you there. As actors, we need to be able to put ourselves in a character's shoes. - But I'm a writer. - And isn't it even more important that a writer can do the same thing? What has happened to this character, to make them behave in this way? We cannot judge our characters if we are going to portray them fairly. Life is our best teacher. The more we experience in our lives, the better we can relate to a wide range of characters. Try to think of a time you did something out of character, something you thought you would never do. Just think about it. For all of you, I'd like you to go home tonight and write down a time when you acted out of character, or surprised yourself. What do you think made you behave in this way? What was different? We'll talk about it next class. - Why do you have to leave? - Family. - Okay, right. - You should come visit me. - [Annie] Oh, thank you. Oh, great! Thanks, bye, Henry. - Hi! Is this all your stuff? - Yeah, this... Yeah. Okay. Thank you. - You brought your bike? - Yeah, I figured I'd just need a mode of transportation. - Smart. Carey and Jake are sleep, so we have to be quiet. - [Annie] Oh, okay. - No, no, no, just... I'll get it later. - [Annie] Okay. - And this is your bedroom. The linen closet is upstairs if you need anymore towels or sheets. - Thank you. I'm going to bed. - Thank you for starting your big adventure here. I'm glad you came. - Me too. (birds chirping) (alarm rings) - [Jake] No, I don't wanna go! - [Kim] That's enough, Jakey. You are going to have so much fun at grandma's. My mom wants to keep Jake for the day. They're going to that play place. - [Carey] Okay, as long as she remembers his nap time. - She knows. Good morning. - [Annie] Morning. - [Carey] Morning! - Hi. - I'm Carey, and you must be Annie? - I am Annie, it's nice to meet you. - Did you sleep well? Yes, I did, thank you. That room is amazing. - It's nice to finally have one of Kim's actor friends come visit. - Annie's a writer. - Even better! Actors are a pain in the ass, am I right? - Sometimes. - So, how long are you crashing with us? - Well, I was thinking about staying maybe a week. I wanna write in a few different places. So, then I'm gonna head to the coast to work on a few short stories and, you know, it's really just unplanned. - Annie wrote some wonderful scenes when we were in class together. She has a gift for the truth. - [Carey] Well, we'll have to introduce her to Corinne then. - Corinne's in publishing. You'll meet her. She'll love you. - Oh, that'd be amazing. Yeah, thank you. - We're having a barbecue this afternoon, are you into barbecue? - Oh, I haven't had barbecue in forever, yeah. - Cool beans, it's a date. Have you done this before? - No. - [Carey] You look like you know what you're doing. (laughs) - No, I put them on wrong. They're on the wrong side. - Aren't they interchangeable? - I'm thinking no, you see, there? Yeah, they can only go in one way and I put them on the wrong way. Crap, you know what? I'm never gonna get them off. - Huh. - You know what? Whatever. - But it looks good to me, can I take it for a spin? - Yeah, sure, have fun. - All right. - So when do I get to see Jake? I haven't seen him yet. - He's at my mom's. - Oh. - [Carey] Remember when I used to ride bikes all the time, when we first dated? It was our favorite. - He's a young soul. - [Annie] So, what does that make me? - You're an old soul. - Does that make you a middle aged soul? - I think so. - Woohoo! Woo! - [Kim] Okay, so just hold it still, okay? And then it's gonna pick up your body's energy. - Good, yeah. - That's a little bit awkward. - [Kim] Everybody has energy. It's so, like, weird. You could see it, it's quivering. - I have some dots. - [Kim] So now you have to ask it a question, like a yes or no question. - [Carey] Okay, bedtime, buddy. - Oh, bedtime for Jakey. Can I get a kiss? - I'll swing ya in. And whip around and say, "Goodnight, Annie." - Oh, okay. - Goodnight! - Goodnight! Oh, I got your ear! - Look who you forgot. - You want that? - My elephant. - Your elephant. - Yeah. Now watch Kim, ey? She's a night hawk. - I won't let her stay up too late. - Yeah. - Goodnight! - Goodnight, I love you. - Goodnight. So, you gonna have more kids? - Let's go outside. I had a miscarriage last month. - Wow. - It was early on. - I'm so sorry to hear that. - It's okay. To be honest, I was sort of relieved. - Really? - Well, not while it was happening. While it was happening, it was awful. - Well, what happened? - Well, Jake was with my mom. Carey was with my dad, they work together. Well, technically my dad works for Carey. - Really? - It's a family business. Anyway, I was at the movie theater, at a matinee, and all of a sudden, I just felt this liquid drop outta me. It was like I was having my period, but all at once. - Oh my God. - And I used to get really heavy periods. At first, I thought it was just that, but then I realized. - So, what did you do? - I got up and walked out of the theater and told the poor girl at concession that I was having a miscarriage and that I would need an ambulance. - [Annie] Oh my God. - At that point, the blood was all the way down to my knees. It was surreal. No one even seemed to notice. I had to call Carey from emergency. He was devastated. And mad at me. - Mad at you? - I hadn't told him yet. - Okay, well... - [Kim] He wants to try again. - And you? - I'm not ready. I feel like Jake should be my favorite, my everything. I don't know that he is. - Well, who is your favorite? Carey? - Who's your favorite? The boyfriend? - I would hardly call him my boyfriend. - Okay. If you could kiss anyone, anyone you've never kissed before, who would you kiss? - [Annie] Like someone I know? Or a celebrity? - Someone you know. - I don't know. - What about Danielle? - She's beautiful, but she's a girl. - Don't you think that's limiting? I mean, you love her, don't you? - Well, yeah, I love her as a friend, but I've never thought about her like that. - Well, do you not think that love should transcend the boxes that we create for ourselves? - [Annie] Maybe, in theory. - Why in theory? - Because that's just... Kim, that's just not real life. - Well, why not? - Because I'm just not like that. - [Kim] No? - Maybe it's because I'm shy. - I like that about you. - We should... I told Carey that you would go to bed early, so yeah... - You're right. You stay up, sleep in, enjoy. (cathedral music) (phone dings) (crickets chirping) (lighter flicks) (phone vibrates) - Hi. - [Luke] What ya doin'? - I am drinking wine and talking to you. - [Luke] Hey. - [Annie] Hay is for horses. - [Luke] What are you wearing? - Clothes, I don't know. What are you wearing? - [Luke] Not clothes. - Oh, really? - [Luke] Really. ♪ So satisfied ♪ ♪ It's a world turning difference by the ♪ (laughs) - Hi! - Hey!

(growls) (imitates clamping) - So what time are we going to the beach? - Soon, my girlfriends are coming. You will love them. - Hey, Kim!

My mom is going to pick him up later. - Oh. - Annie, this is Corinne and Nicole. - [Nicole] Hi, nice to meet you. - Corinne is the one I mentioned to you. Annie is a writer. - Oh, well, we'll have to chat then! - I would love that! I would love that. (island music) - I heard she's doing well. - Oh. - Hey, Kim! You're such a MILF! Carey, you'd better keep your eye on that. - [Carey] I've got it under control. - [Jake] Dad, let's go! - So, how did you two meet? - Well, I was registering for an acting/writing workshop. - I just knew I had to do what this woman was doing. I don't think you were honestly that serious about enrolling. - Why do you judge people so quickly? - It's self-protection. - From what? - Phonies? - Hey, babe, your mom's here. - Speak of the devil. - Hi, sweetie! Nice suit, you're looking fit. - Elaine, looking good. - Control yourself. - Mom, this is Annie. - [Annie] Hi, it's so nice to meet you. - Hello, Annie.

I'll show you. - Do you really think now is the best time to be entertaining guests? - I'm fine, mom. - You should be focused on your family. And who's this Annie? - Mom, it's fine. Do you have to use the toilet before you go? - No. - [Kim] Are you sure? - Yes. - You should try. - No thank you. - Well, you aren't allowed in grandma's car if you don't try and go potty first. ♪ Everybody get up now ♪ - Hey, guys, who wants to smoke some pot? - I do!
