Oleksandr Dovzhenko Studio Kyiv National Institute of Theater Named after Ivan Karpenko-Karoho CONSCIENCE If you do not find the criminal in three days, they will shoot you. You translated incorrectly. I said, "You will be destroyed, every last one of you." How did you teach children German? You are dismissed for today. What are you saying? I don't understand. "Don't understand!" And what's that? A revolver. - Shoot! - Where's the clip? Shoot, why don't you? Can't you hear? I can't find it! Shoot, damn it! Something's stuck. Turn the safety off! Get a move on! Get moving, I said! Stop! She's working in the field. A German gave me candy. Good evening. Good evening. Come in and sit down. What is it you want to say, woman? Have you found some guy to be father to your kids yet? Why are you so timid? Go on and speak. You're teasing me, neighbor. Can I borrow your sieve to sift my flour? Take it, it's no trouble. Until morning? For as long as we're alive. Two men came to my place, both bleeding quite a bit. I know. I've seen them in the field. It's so frightening. God save us! Fellows, take me with you to be a partisan. My man's such a good-for-nothing he can't even give me a baby. Don't talk nonsense, girl. Wait! Stop, I say! Who's that creeping around in the middle of the night? Hands up! Raise your hands, I say! Or I'll hit you right between the eyes. Ah, it's you. Naughty boy. It's me. Hi there. Hi there, hi. Did you kill the commandant? I won't tell you. The Germans are there. Be careful... Who knows whose things these are? Who knows whose things these are? If you don't give up the killer, they'll shoot you in the morning. The whole village. How long will you stay silent? I got it. It's buzzing! Damned fiends! God will punish you! It flew away. Come here. It's dark here, they won't catch us. Mama! - Don't shoot! - Be quiet! - Don't shoot! - Quiet! - Don't shoot! Don't shoot! - Quiet! If you remain silent, the rest will be shot tomorrow morning. Give me your hand. - Go by yourself, I can't do it. - I'll carry you. We can't make it. There are Germans on the bridge. Find the partisans. Ask around... search the forest. Do whatever you can. Find them before morning. Now go. Don't delay. I'll cover you. Bye. Thank you. Stay safe. You too. You! Me. Fool. Don't accuse me, it just happened. Go to bed and sleep. Nobody will find you here. Thanks, but don't trouble yourself. I'll go. Fool! Go on, go. And tomorrow one hundred people will be shot just because of you. Is your mother in the village? No. Sister or brother? No. - Wife, lover? - No. Any relatives? No. So why didn't anyone give you up? I don't know. Probably because I'm from here. Your confession is a lie. I killed the commandant. I do not believe you. Maybe you're only looking for death? Yours.
