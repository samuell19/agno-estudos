Ladies and gentlemen I'd like to direct your attention to the screen in front of you. We'll be showing a brief safety demonstration. While boarding the flight please keep the aisle clear - and find your designated seat. - Argh! In the event of a water landing Chloe Bridges lips can be used as a flotation device. Please enjoy one complementary drink. Please store your carry on in one of the overhead compartments. If you need to flee the aircraft beware of sharp objects as they can puncture the evacuation slide. We ask that all seat backs and titty tassels are in their full upright positions. If you have to smoke, please disable the lavatory smoke detectors so as not to wake the other passengers. The flight attendants will now demonstrate proper safety procedures. Pull the cord to inflate the safety chest. As a reminder racial profiling is strictly tolerated, please report any suspicious ethnicity. If you do not have a selfie stick, one will be provided for you. Please keep your seat belts fastened at all times as we may experience unexpected flatulence. As a reminder there is no crying allowed on this flight, please silence your baby at this time or it will be checked to your final destination. Thank you for choosing Koalair, koality you can trust. At this time your portable electronic devices must be set... ...to airplane mode. You're on the other side of the world, how can we possibly make this work? Let's just make things simple like when we first met on Chatroulette. When we first connected, fell in love, and the sparks flew when I asked you those deep, personal questions like, what were those? Oh yeah, - age, sex, location? - Yeah. Hey Logan, I'm ready to take this to the next level. Oh yes, here we go. Come on, old friend. Who are you talking to? Just a second freshening up. Okay, okay, babe, now these are for your eyes only. Yeah, don't worry babe, it's just me. Do you have any almond milk? Uh... you were jerking off. Come on man! You shouldn't just burst into people's rooms like that. And you shouldn't be jerking off in the middle of the day with your door unlocked and all your friends downstairs. Now, do you have almond milk or not? Come on man, it's next to my socks, you know that. Yo we're drinking up. Sorry about that babe. Okay. - Who was that? - Oh. That would be Juanpa, my foreign exchange brother who's overstayed his welcome by a decade! What about your real brother, Jake? Oh. Disney got him. Okay. - Argh.

Imagine our second date, remember all the sexy shit I was typing to you?

Yeah, that's literally why they invented conventions, so you can fuck. It's like the only place you can cheat on your wife and get a free gift basket. The gift baskets, uh, but the cheating. - So this means... - You can have sex finally. Ooh. No more virginity! - Yeah Juanpa. - I'm not gonna be a virgin, Logan! Let's do it!

You're so brave for coming to Australia, Logan, - I can't believe you're coming. - I am absolutely terrified but I'm coming. Crikey, I have to go, bye. Okay. Time to say goodbye, old friend. One more time for old time's sake. No. You're making this harder than it has to be.

Yeah that's what I thought, that's what I thought. You want some cheese, pal, you got cheese in Russia? Oh, you got a built in cheese grater right there, look at you, huh, look at you. What does that taste like, borsht? What else? Oh, Choco-taco. I hope you're not dairy intolerant there, Ruski. How's that? Oh yeah, oh yeah. What the fuck you looking at, Aladdin? Nothing, what's your problem? I got no problem, I'm just racist. I do respect queers though. They've been through a lot. Now you got that gay marriage. Used to be what they'd do is illegal. Now they got shows about it. - I binge watch. - Okay, dude. Is he still looking? Yeah. And that's how I lost 15 percent of my right testicle. Yup, a dwarf in a Godzilla costume, can you imagine? I don't have to imagine, you just told me every last detail. There's nothing more I could possibly learn about your balls. Oh you'd be surprised, they could do a whole 60 minute special on my balls. Does your Internet girlfriend know about your deflated testicle? It's not deflated and no, we have not crossed that bridge yet. Alright, I'm sorry I got to ask, how can you love someone you never actually met? - She makes me snort. - What? She's funny, she's got a great sense of humor, - I know it's cheesy but... - Bro, I could make you snort in two seconds. No you could not, okay. It's practically impossible to make me laugh. It takes someone creative, it takes someone original. - Got to make a good joke to make me laugh. - Argh! - Aw. Does this mean that you love me? - Ah... By the way, thanks for pepping me up earlier. I know it may not have seemed like much but it really helped. Yeah, yeah, no problem Logan. Alright, I am going to try to get some sleep and hopefully not dream of dwarfzilla. Or swollen balls. - Yeah. - Am I right? Yeah, okay goodnight. I'm gonna nominate your shoulder as my pillow, okay. Did you really just wipe your snot on my shoulder? No. Is this shit? Oh, okay, thank God. Hey, I have noticed that the seatbelt sign has been off for the last several hours and I just think that... Oh! That is very unprofessional and unsafe and Jesus Christ are you gonna suck his dick all the way to Australia? Fuck it! I'll finish him off. Oh my god! We need your assistance in the cockpit, sir. Are you fucking kidding me? Sir, we really need your assistance in the cockpit. You're crazy if you think I'm gonna let this soviet psychopath sit back here alone. Sir, with all due respect this is more important. Do you know what this guy's capable of? He is the reason you have your privates scanned at the airport, and I hate having my privates scanned. I had my dick lobbed off by a pottery wheel. Now my dick looks like the stump at the end of the giving tree. Oh. If you so much as flinch I will make you a member of the dick stump club. There are three of us. We meet on Wednesdays. Damn it. - What the fuck is on his mouth? - I just thought they were making oral love, - I had no idea that they were... - Oh you had no idea. - You had no idea? - No. TAS article 1219 clearly states - no pilot shall engage in dick suckery without a spotter. - What? - Dick suckery? - How would I know that? - Cause that's your job. - It's not my job. - Is everything okay? Hey, go back to your seat. ok? Go back to your seat now or I'm gonna tase you till you shit. What happened to the pilots? Hey look, just be quiet, okay, we don't want the rest of the plane to know the pilots are dead, we're fucked. Dead, the pilots are dead? - Holy fucking shit. - I came in here. And I found them like that and I was like, "Oh my god what do I do", and then I went and got him. - And now it's... - Alright listen. Shut up, shut up both of you calm down, okay? Listen to me. - Hey over here, over here, over here. - Ok, ok. Listen to me, okay, I'm trained for situations like this. You go get me a car battery, a tourniquet, and a bendy straw. I'll have these zombie pilots flying in no time. Sir, we don't have anymore bendy straws. - Oh fuck! - Fuck. - Alright. - We are so fucked. I'm just gonna have to land this plane myself. - You can fly? - There are two things in my life that I love. Flying jets and pottery. - I gave my dick for it. - Oh. I'm gonna land this plane and we're gonna be just fine. Argh! Holy shit. - Ahh. - Hey boss had a bit of radio silence from flight 1524 from Los Angeles. Oi, well you know what they say, "Silence is golden", huh, especially from Los Angeles. Bunch of fucking hippies. Hipsters. What the fuck is Coachella anyway? Where's my baby? Is that a baby?

Sir, sir... hi, as much as I love that Versace blouse you are cannot breast feed that baby right here. Really? Well I think I can breast feed this random baby wherever the fuck I want. - No you can't. No you can't. - Okay? God gave me nipples and I'll be damned if I don't use them, okay? Okay, well, little science lesson, men don't produce breast milk incidentally so, ah. Aw, oh, no. It's a miracle. Oh God, you're a squirter. Yeah, yeah milk facial. Who wants a milk mask?

Damn it, Log, what do you want bro? Can get that crow bar back? Juanpa, we need to talk. Now. Now! Oh shit. You taking a selfie? Yeah it's lit. Argh! Should we try CPR? No man, I already tried that. Wait, wait, wait, wait. So this means you made out with a guy? - Juanpa, this is not the time. - Was it nice? Um... - What? - It must be nice. - Dude, focus please. - Yeah. They're actually dead, bro. Aw, nah, nah, nah. What, what should we do? I don't know. Maybe someone else has a plan. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah that's a great idea, Log, who should we get, oh Brittany Furlan? Who wants a body shot? Or the guy who makes me doubt my sexuality, huh? Maybe King Bach, he's your buddy right? Ah, ah, ah, ah! Think straight. You're right, everyone will panic. I need you to figure this out, okay? I need to put my seed into a woman's vagina before I die. Okay, you go do that, you go do that, because I'm probably gonna crash this plane. - Alright, one of us has to succeed, okay? - Yeah. - Yeah. Okay. - One of us will. - One of us. - Yeah. Probably you. ♪ Don't that feel Real funky ya'll ♪ Brittany, I want to take a body shot. Okay, come here, bitch. Jenna? Hey, Jenna? - Hey. - Oh, hey stranger, where you been? Um...

Amber alert, we've got a missing person aisle in seat 2E, suspect, looks like he's been crying. I'm not crying. Vitaly killed them and both of the pilots are already dead and I'm really scared right now, 'cause no one is flying this plane right now Jenna and I'm really scared and you're the only person I can trust to help. Okay that's adorable and a really good story but we land in a few hours. I'm gonna try to sleep - No, no. - ...and you're gonna try to get your shit together. - No, no, no. Please, please, please, Jenna please just follow me, okay? You need to see this. These pilots better be dead. - Oh shit. I jinxed it. - Yeah, I know right, what are the odds? Hey, you wouldn't by chance know how to drive a 767, would ya? We're all gonna die! Calm down, calm down, calm down. Calm down, calm down. Do you know how to drive a 767? You unlucky bastard! Okay.

Now, for the last time, do you know how to drive a 767? - No, I don't know how to fly a 767. - Come on. So I'm just gonna go back to my seat and look at pictures of my dog until we crash. Until we crash, we crash, we crash... Hey buddy. I heard you took quite the little crash. Okay, let see what the problem is. You puked on my bones! I'm so sorry, I don't know what came over me. Ew. Are you okay? What was that? The flight attendants, they'll know what to do. Did you just fart? But where did they go? We got to find them. Surprise. What the hell is wrong with you? What's wrong, you don't like pranks? We don't like what, I couldn't understand you, what? Amber alert, somebody's missing a sense of humor down in the luggage. Amber Alert was my drag name. Okay. The flight attendants are nowhere to be found - but I'm sure everything's gonna be fine, right? - How is it gonna be fine, Logan? I don't know but they probably figured out how to save the day. We're in an emergency right now, you can't, you can't just sit there. We need to do something. Press this button and the flight attendants will come. Don't press the button, that's not for emergencies, - that's for fucking water. - Please. Wow, okay, at least have the balls to do something. Oh my god, I just hit the jackpot. How is this all free? You're a mother. - Oh, fuck. - Give me these. - Jesus. - Damn, you have a baby. You're supposed to have seven of those but, you know. Taking care of business. You can do it, Logan, you can do it. If you won't do it for her, do it for my virginity. Use your wings you big pussy, pussy... What are you doing here? I'm gonna drive this plane. Whoa, whoa, whoa, do you even know what you're doing? No, but I'm a fast learner. Great, well, I hope that wasn't important. Hey, hey check it out I think I've figured out the radio. Air traffic control to flight 1524? Air traffic control to flight 1524? Oh my god you're there, hello. Aye, Benji here. Been trying to talk to you guys for ages. Yeah Benji, we're here man. I take it you're not the pilots? Uh, no, no, my name is Logan Paul. You're not a terrorist, are you mate? No, I'm a social media sensation. We're a bit full of ourselves, aren't we, mate? Why don't you stroke the tip a bit more? - What? - What happened to the pilots, mate? - They're dead. - No worries, mate. - What happened to the flight attendants? - They're missing. - Slight worry but don't worry, we'll take care of ya. - Really? Amber Alert, missing flight attendants of flight 1524. What was that? Aussie joke mate, you wouldn't get the reference. Okay. It appears you guys are a bit off course so I'm gonna punch in some new coordinates, all you have to do is engage the auto pilot and the plane will literally land itself. Oh. That's great news, yeah. You'll be a bloody hero, mate. Yeah, yeah! Now you've got to raise the auto pilot lever and engage the system. Okay, what does it look like? Big orange stick mate, can't miss it. Um, can you be a little more specific? It literally says autopilot right on the thing there, mate. Um. Is that all it says? Big orange lever, center console, are you bloody color blind? It's the only thing between you and certain death. I broke it. - I'm sorry what? - I broke off the autopilot by accident. Sir? Sir, you there? Crikey. It would appear there are now a few more worries than my original estimate of no worries. - How bad is it? - You're fucked, mate. Oh my god. Oh my god. What do you mean I'm fucked? That's a great question. Well, you're all types of fucked! You're totally fucked, you're completely fucked. You're like a parrot getting raped. - You're fucked, I'm fucked. - Yeah. You're a little boy in a windowless van, you're fucked and you're gonna die. Speaking of which I don't like talking to dead people, it really bums me out so I'm gonna cut out early for lunch if no one minds and, uh, grab a quick bite. Right, feeling a bit peckish. I mind, I definitely do mind. Well, too bad you're going to be dead soon, Benji out. Alright, who wants tacos? - What a dick. - How could you break the autopilot? It's not like I did it on purpose. Oh, oh you didn't do it on purpose? Well, that's great, everything's just fine then, right, 'cause Logan didn't do it on purpose. Give me this stupid thing. No, no, no. Um, pay, pay no mind to the sound of struggle. We are fine and smooth as silk. - Logan, they need to know. - Jenna, no they don't. I know you're probably terrified right now and I am too, but what you're doing is not helping. So just give me the intercom, just hey. Aw fuck, hey guys if you look to your right and also to your left you will notice the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean. Oh, the ocean that's so romantic. Okay, take your fucking shot, Juanpa. Woohoo! We have to do something. Yeah, yeah I mean it can be that hard, right? We'll first we can move these bodies I mean they're really starting to smell. Yeah. Up we go. Oh, I'm impressed. Yeah, moving corpses is easy. Oh no, just dry heaves. - Okay. - I won't throw up. I'm sorry. Nice. Ew. Get the fuck out of my way. Have you seen my baby? No? Oh your breath stinks. Have you seen my baby? No. Oh sir, have you seen my baby? Your baby's missing? Yeah. I know your plight, I'm a new mother myself. I'll help you find him, what does he look like? Uh, he's a baby and he's white and he's got little arms. Is this your baby? Hey. Uh... I don't think so. I don't think so. Look lady, I'm not Dog the fucking baby hunter. Okay, this baby that I found simply doesn't have the wherewithal to raise itself and that's where I come in. That really looks... Why you touch baby? Who do you think you are? Walking around drunk around this plane losing babies. You smell like Jack Daniels's dick. I'm so sorry. You get the fuck out of our face and you leave us alone. Why do men hate me so much? Because it's so easy. Boo fucking hoo. Do you know what would be a hilarious prank? If we poisoned every passenger on this plane. - No, no. - Tell me where the emergency oxygen supply is. Never. - Never? - Never. - Never? - Never. - Never? - No. Tell me how I access the oxygen, or I'll feed this dog cat food. Never! God no! Whoa! The poor dog, no. Good doggy. That's not what he's supposed to eat. It's in the safety glass by the door. - Why did you tell him, bitch? - It's by the door. - You're going to pay for that. - Thank you, thank you. You're going to pay for that. Oh God, no. One for me. One for you. What are you doing? By the way it was dog food the whole time. What kind of a man feeds a dog cat food? How sick do you think I am? It's just a prank. You're probably not gonna believe me when I tell you this but you know most people think I'm this huge slut. But I've actually never even been with a man before. Really? Maybe I can help you with that, I've got some experience in that arena. Aren't you like 16? Seventeen. Oh sorry, 17, my god. You're still illegal. Hey, so what, we're all gonna die. - What? - Okay, look my dick can't handle anymore. The pilots are dead and Logan's flying the plane. - What? - You're so cute, and funny, and Mexican. That's not funny, I, I took a picture. - Who is flying the plane? - Logan's flying the fucking plane, alright. Listen, we've got nothing else left to lose. This is either the most elaborate pick-up line I've ever heard or we are really all gonna die. Either way you're fucked. Good point. Oh my god. Fuck is going on back there? Shit. Son of a bitch. Hey, how the fuck you sleeping through this? Wake your ass up. I'm sure we about too down in this bitch. Wait, wait, I'm not on the pill. Neither am I, neither am I. ♪ Oh shit ♪ Oh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah oh. Oh, shit! There's a solution to any problem. A wise woman once said, "Shake it off..." Simba! Give this video a thumbs up! Give me that selfie stick, give me that selfie stick. This is what panicking looks like. Yo, flight 1524 we are out here. Your boy came back like a movie star. Follow me on Twitter at...

But you know what, there's more to me than just a pretty face. I'm also a junior pilot. I don't know what's going on back there but I'm either gonna save the day or die trying. Fuck yeah man, fucking do it. - Hooray! - Hooray! Yeah, let's do this, let's do this! Hey you, Yakuza. Did you see anything, hum? Jackie Chan? Jackie, you, you see anything? No? Shh. Hello everybody, it's the homosexual flight helper. The cabin pressure is still so low, please put you oxygen masks back on. Thank you. Don't do it, Logan. Vitaly kazed the oxygen supply. Godspeed my little cream pie. Jenna wait, don't put that on. Why? Something's wrong with the oxygen. How do you know? I hear gay people. I have to go find him. Logan no. Please, don't. Damn it. Hey you. Argh. Ah, my dick. My asshole, my asshole! Argh! I think it turned inside out! Oh my god. Nick! Ah, great. Not the vodka. Ow! Ow shit! Holy shit, what the hell are you doing? Completing my master prank. There's no social media convention with all of you dead, all of your followers will be mine. Imagine the power. Wait, you've been pranked. - What are you talking about? - It was just all a prank, bro. Look closely, all these people are acting, see? Look at this guy. Hello, I'm okay. You have been pranked. - Nick? - See? Even that girls in on it. Fuck you Vitaly! Oh shit, I have a boner. Argh! Wha... Wake up you chiseled brute. Oh, we are so fucking mcfucked. This crazy Russian, he's gonna crash the plane and he threw out all the parachutes except one. Holy shit. Is that dog eating cat food? Logan, baby, it's dog food in a cat food can. Oh thank God. With a hint of Nick Bateman. It's just a prank, bro, but I can assure you your death will be very real. Thanks for covering my tracks, Logan Paul. I owe you one. No, no, no, no, no, not the button, no, no that... If I die I'm taking you with me, you fuck. Oh God I'm only 23, sort of. I can't hold on anymore! Tell my boyfriend Steve to hide all the pornography. Maverick, no, no, no! Maverick! That's my bird! Oh God, thank you, thank you, we're all together. Hey, hey, hey, it's okay, hey. Save the day cum sponge. Hey Bruce. Any final advice on how to land this plane? If you can get to the cockpit, engage the autopilot. The plane will literally land itself. Okay. Erm... Vitaly, where is Jenna? Nice try, ha. - Ah! - Oh, shit, I am so sorry, I thought I could jump kick Vitaly and save the day, it would have been really cool. Yeah, shut up and stop him! Here. - I hope you die! - Argh! This is just a flesh wound, have a safe flight, captain. - Oomph! - Aww! Oh shit. You'll be missed. Do you get it? The jet engine turned him into mist. Okay. You got a plane to land. I got this. - I don't got this. - Oh no, you do got this. - I don't know if I got this. - I mean if you don't got this, then who got this? I guess I'm gonna need to get this. Oh this best going to get got then. It will, it's best gone got and there ain't nobody better to go - and get this than get me. - You got to get it while the goings good. Oh the goings good and I'm at get it while the getting's good. - You got to get it. - I'm gonna get it. What the fuck are you people talking about? - Get out there, come on. - I'm a get it. You're gonna get it. Okay. You can do it, Logan, you can do it. You're not supposed to look down, just do it. It's gonna go on YouTube. YouTube, YouTube... You two, you two, you two need to land this fucking plane. I did not get laid Logan! - Jenna, do you have service yet? - Er... Yeah. Yeah, yeah here. Oh, well, this is great service. Go on get the last scoop out of the carton. With the squatty potty you get complete elimination. - Skip the ad. - I can't, it won't let me. Yes, it will give you the best poop of your life, guaranteed. Argh! If I die because of this shit! Umm. They're good at pooping. Hey guys, it Connor and today I'm gonna be teaching you how to land a passenger jet. Flying is easy and with the right education and guidelines almost anyone can learn the secrets of flight. - Amazing. Ok. - It's easy. All you have to do is pay attention... Nobody will watch your stupid videos. Leave me alone, Becky. Fuck you, Becky! I'm telling mom about your abortion. Fuck you. Cool, okay, here are the basics. This is the yoke, it's like the steering wheel but here's the thing you need to know, the controls are inverted so, up is down, and down is up. Oh. This knob controls the flaps. The flaps give the plane lift and drag. When landing you want the flaps fully extended. Remember, were going for maximum air resistance. - Turn the knob. - Okay, okay. The most important part of landing is of course the... Connor, your sister said you're looking at anime porn again. - She's lying. - That's gross. - God damn it, Connor! - Fuck you, Becky! When you get your own house you can masturbate then. - Okay, let's just skip ahead here. - Yeah, skip that. Once you've done that it's time to engage the auto pilot, the plane with literally land itself, how cool is that? It's okay. No, my phone. Okay. Hey what's that? What is...? By the grace of Steve Irwin you're still magically on course. - Way to go, mate. - Benji, is that you? Sure is, mate, and by the look of it you're still not out of the woods yet. - What? - You're still quite fucked. - How fucked? - Mate, you're missing an engine, you're running out of fuel, and you're dropping like a dead albatross with diabetes. Now normally I'd say check the cross winds, 20 knots from the southeast but I'd bet my last dollar I do you don't understand a word of that. Yeah no shit I don't, Benji. Just try to land on the white line, fly straight and pray you don't explode on contact. And Logan. - What? - You owe me a dollar you do. - I fucking hate you Benji! - Hey lose the tude, mate. Benji, I swear to God if I survive this I'm... Oi, wait a second, would you look at that? That koala looks like Hugh Jackman. I got to go bag me that koala. Man the fort, Hansen. Fuck the baby, I don't want to die. Aw! What... - What the fuck? - Get this fucking monkey off me. Don't touch her. Oh my god, Logan, Logan. - Logan, we landed. - What? - We landed. - Oh shit, oh my god. We did it. Oh, wait we're not stopping, why aren't we stopping? All you have to do. Connor! Okay, once you've landed you're gonna want to hit the breaks with both feet. Brakes. Thanks for watching and don't forget to subscribe. Oh my god, you did it. No Jenna, we did it. Please don't ruin the moment with your cheesy bullshit. We should probably get off this thing. Following a hijacking and an engine failure on board flight 1524 an incredible chain of events has led to the rescue... Fuck her right in the pussy. Awesome! Aye, mate. Benji? You're actually alive. I owe you a dollar I do. Don't worry about that. Genuinely surprised to see you alive. Took a lot of guts to do what you did today. Hey buddy. Hey man. So? - I failed, Log, I failed. - Aw. - Oh, come on. - I guess blue balls is real. It hurts, it hurts man. No, eh, eh, don't say that man. - You're still alive. - I guess. Your foreign exchange brother is still a virgin. No man, my brother is still a virgin. Such a tender moment. Hey. Hey. Eugene, is that really you? It's been 70 years. The last orgasm I had was in Normandy in your mouth. Consider it VD day. Bombs away. Uh... So Australia's pretty nice huh? Yeah. Yeah. Er... - Does it like hurt? Aw. - Ow, ow, no I'm fine. - Okay. - I got a bandage. - You did good driving that plane. - Thanks. Couldn't have done it without my co-pilot. What did I tell you about being cheesy? - To not be cheesy. - Yeah, definitely stop. So I've looked everywhere and I can't find him. Aw! I think it safe to say that your baby's gone. Have you considered adoption maybe? I mean no, I, I thought I'd find him on the plane, you know? Right. That's horrible. Well, here's some good news. When that plane was going down and I thought we were all dead, I had one split second to ejaculate into this Tupperware so I could let my seed live on. I made this out of my penis. Put it in your vagina, make a new baby. Oh my god, this is the nicest thing any man's ever done for me. It's pretty great. - Thank you. - Yeah. But it still doesn't bring my baby back. What your old baby? - Yeah. - This is a brand new baby. You ungrateful bitch. Give me my seed back you don't deserve it. You do not deserve... No I'm sorry, spit it out, spit it out put it back in my vagina. - Too late! It's too late! - I'm sorry! You've wasted my seed! No, I'm sorry, put it back in my vagina please. Please, please. It's going back into my penis, I can feel it. I have nothing else to live for. I'm getting hard! I guess this is goodbye. Yup, I hope everything works out with your girlfriend. That was really brave. - Come here. - Bye. Thank you so much, I woke up on the toilet. Jenna wait. Thank you so much. I don't even know you people. - I'm your brother. - I know you. Okay, here we go. You're excited? - Yeah. - This is it, right? This is it. This is it. Are you sure about this? I've never been so sure about anything in my life. Logan! Eh, yeah, it's me. Er, I'm Logan. Wait, you're not Logan. - You sound different. - Yeah. I'm his foreign exchange brother Juanpa. - Mexico. - So? And I have an accent. What? No, no, I can't understand you though. Can you say that again? One more time, just, just say it one more time. Okay, okay, don't say anything cheesy. Jenna? It took me traveling half way around the world to realize - that I love you. - I'm sorry your accent is just gnarly, can you please just repeat yourself? Okay, uh, I guess you worked out everything with your boyfriend. Oh, yeah, the guac is extra, I got it, I got it, I got it. Who was that guy, he's fucking hot. You're gay, you're a gay man, yeah! Oh my god, so are you. - No, no, I'm, I'm here for her, so. - Logan? But, but, but just one kiss, that's all I ask. Okay, fine, but then you have to leave. Now get out. Wait, how did you hear my thoughts? Whoa yeah, I guess I always thought you were a little bit... - Yeah, take it off. - Yeah. - Hurry up. - I will, I will. Oh yeah. I'm going there. - Oh yeah. - Hurry up. - Why can't you get it off? - Yeah, yeah I got it. - Is... er... aw... Wait, stop. - Trying. - Is this the right hole? - No, no, - no, no. - No, no? Yes? - No? Okay, yeah. - There it is, yeah. - Yeah, no, this one? - Yeah, right there. Okay, okay, okay. Juanpa, Juanpa. Oh, oh this feels amazing. - I love your accent. - I love your accent. Talk dirty to me in Mexican. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wait I, I have to know. What happened, like, did she have a penis? What the fuck? Daddy, I thought you were gone. Oh my god, your dad is black. I mean that's, that's cool, he's black. I can't stop, I can't stop. Daddy you have... - Your dad's black. - I'm adopted. Oh my god, I'm adopted too, we have so much in common. Swear I'm gonna kill your dumb ass. I love you, Juanpa. It's pronounced Juanpa. I'm whooping your ass. Run Juanpa, run. Daddy stop, run, go, go.
