(foreboding music) (thunder crashing) (door cracking) - Elizabeth! - Mrs. Cartwright! - The storm must have knocked out the power. She's been suffering from depression. - Mrs. Cartwright! - [Man] Elizabeth? - Mrs. Cartwright! - [Man] I've been trying to phone ever since she missed her appointment yesterday. (dial tone beeping) (lightning striking) - Sweet Jesus. (eerie whimpering) (screaming) (screeching) - Ah! Ah! (grunting) (screeching) (officer grunting) (body thudding) (thunder crashing) (police radio chatter) (car screeching) (romantic orchestral music) - So, Danielle, do you take this man, Brad, to be your lawful wedded husband? - I do. - And Brad, do you take this woman, Danielle, to be your lawful wedded wife? - I do. - By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. (guests applauding) (Danielle laughing) - Is it too late for me to kiss the bride? - I didn't think you were gonna make it, Professor. - I wouldn't miss my two favorite students' wedding. - (chuckles) You just did. - So where are we headed on the honeymoon? You know, the honeymoon phase was always my favorite. I'm just kidding. Congratulations. - Thanks, Paul. - Hawaii. And we're not taking you. - Oh, I'll just stop by every once in a while. - The Sunset House? - Consider it a wedding present and your first assignment. This house goes on the market tomorrow morning. That's why I want you two down in Bird Song as soon as possible so you can put a bid on it before anybody else. This is a perfect opportunity for you to use your gift. - (exhales) That's what I thought. - Brad... - Danielle. Don't take your talent for granted. There are very few people who can contact the other side. You still have the skater? - Yeah. - Use it. Take it to the Sunset House and make contact. - Don't make this a bigger deal than it is. - No, Danielle, you heard what Ballard said, he's offered you a job. - Yeah, we're a team. And you're the scientist, not me. - Don't you find it just a little bit suspicious that he picks today to offer us our first assignment? - Yeah, so the timing's bad, but this is the chance of a lifetime. Do you really want to turn it down? - No. - Are you sure? 'Cause if you do, I'd understand. - No, like you say, it's the chance of a lifetime. We can hold off the honeymoon. (Danielle laughs) (church bell ringing) - [Man] Congratulations. Keep her warm, bro. I hear Maine gets pretty damn cold. (guests applauding) - [Woman] Oh, have fun! - [Man] Have a great time. Bye, guys. (foreboding music) (car braking) (Brad exhaling) - Here we go. - The house was built in 1905, but it still has all the original woodwork and this banister here is made of solid oak. (laughs) Oh, you don't want to go in there. (chuckles) Why don't you follow me upstairs? - Looks like somebody's been living in here. - Yes, that would have been Martha McCreavy, she lived here for years before dropping like a stone last month. - Huh. (eerie music) Well, that's uh... Interesting decor. (Danielle laughs) - Well, she was a very superstitious woman. Arthritis made it difficult for her to go upstairs, but that room will clean up into a magnificent dining room. Would you like to follow me upstairs? Both of you? Now, this is the master bedroom. - Oh. - Again, a paint job may be in order, but this room has a wonderful hillside view of the grove. - [Brad] Nice. - [Danielle] Mm. - How much are you asking? - 85 thousand. - Deal. - The house is perfect for you! Why don't we go downstairs and start the paperwork? - All right. - [Realtor] This way. - Whew! (Danielle laughs) Are you, uh, sure we've seen everything? - Well I think so. I've shown you the view and the bedroom and the gazebo. Was there something else that you wanted to see? - What about the ghost? - [Realtor] I beg your pardon? - Well, we've just heard some reports that the house was haunted and that's why it was changing owners so often. - Oh, don't be ridiculous. Why, Martha McCreavy lived here for years without a single complaint. - Yeah, but what about the people before her? - Well, I'm not sure what you mean. - You can be totally candid with us, Mrs. Baker. You see uh, we're parapsychologists, which means that we're uh, let's just say interested in the subject matter. - Well, I don't understand. You mean you want a haunted house? - We just want the truth, Mrs. Baker. Is there a ghost in the house? (foreboding music) - Not just a ghost. But a demon, whose screams come straight from the depths of hell. - We'll take it. - We'll take it. (sign creaking) (eerie music) (Danielle starts) (Brad laughs) - Did I scare you? - Yeah, a little bit. - A little bit? - Yeah. - Yeah. You like to be scared? - Yeah. - Well, consider it a honeymoon preview. - Yeah? - Yeah. (Danielle moans) (grandfather clock ticking) (ghostly laughter) (candle flaring) (ghostly breathing) - Mm, we should be setting up the equipment. - Oh, yeah. The only problem is the electricity doesn't go on till tomorrow. (tuts) - That's not what it feels like. (both laugh) Mm. (Danielle moaning) (Brad moaning) - I cannot wait two months. (Brad laughing) (deepening voice) I'll tear your soul apart! (eerie screeching) (sizzling) (wind gusting) (glass shattering) - [Danielle] It was just like the reports. Candles, temperature. (shard clattering) - First thing tomorrow we'll set up the equipment and the cameras. I wanna get numbers. I want tape on all this. - Okay, I'll call Paul. - Well, listen, I got a couple of minutes right now. Why don't you call him right now? Ow! You know, you're doing that on purpose. - Well, you deserved it. (slams receiver) - Well, you can't blame me for not liking the guy, Dani. - Well, he is our boss. He needs to know what happened, Brad. - Are you saying that our work is more important than our marriage? - No, what I'm saying is we were caught off guard and if this thing shows up again we need to be ready. - We will be.

We're entitled, we deserve this. Come on. Come on. - Okay. Let's go. (country music playing) Wow, this is the hot spot, huh? - Mm-hmm. I like it here. They got beer, they got music, there's people here. This is great, what more do you need? - I'll take another one. - Sure. Let me have two more of these. - [Bartender] You got it. (tapping) (Danielle laughs) - Well, hi there, pretty lady. - Um, this seat's taken, sorry. - Sure it is. And you are? - Not interested. (man laughs) - Very good, very good. Obviously college educated. Well, don't you worry, pretty lady. I ain't gonna hold that against you. You mind if I buy you a beer? - Thanks, my husband's taking care of it. - Yeah? - Mm. - But is he taking care of you? Look, I know when there's something dead in a relationship. You see, I'm a gravedigger by trade. (man laughs) (slamming bottle) - Why don't you move? - You got a problem? - Okay, Brad, let's just go. - That's my wife. - Yeah? Well, I was married for a minute myself once, so why don't you just save me the gory details and get the hell outta my face, college boy. - Let me ask you something, you wouldn't happen to be related to the Ballad family by any chance? More specifically, Professor Paul Ballard-- - What the hell are you-- (smashing) (Brad spits) (keys jangling) - (clears throat) Where's the bottle opener? - I think you've had enough beer. - You know what, babe, you are so right. Thank you so much. Time to switch to bourbon. - You embarrassed yourself tonight, Brad. - No, Danielle, the only thing that embarrassed me was you. - [Danielle] Me? - Yeah. - What did I do? - Because I left you alone for two seconds then I come back and what are you doing? You're flirting with somebody. - I wasn't flirting, some guy just sat down. What was I supposed to do? - What are you supposed to do? You're supposed to make him go away, Danielle! - I tried. - Well, obviously not hard enough! - You have no reason to be jealous. You're the one that I'm married to. - Let me ask you something. If I can't trust you now, what kinda marriage are we gonna have later? - You can trust me. - I used to think that, Dani. - This isn't about some stupid guy in a bar, this is about Professor Ballard, isn't it? (bottle slamming) - No, Danielle, this is about you! (grandfather clock ticks) It's about you, okay? Nobody forced you! (eerie growling) Nobody twisted your arm, Dani! Where are you going? - I'm going to bed. - No, you're not. Not until we finish this. - I can't talk to you when you're like this. - When I'm like what? - Let go of me, you're... Let go of me. Let go of me! (doors slamming) (bottle shattering) - Danielle? Danielle, what's wrong? Dani? - Did you have anything to drink last night? - My husband and I had a couple beers. - From what I heard, your husband had quite a few more than a couple. - Word travels fast around here, huh? - Bird Song is a small town. You and your husband bought the Sunset place. I find that interesting, considering the rumors. Sit up, please. - Well, I hope they're not just rumors. That's why we bought the place. - So, Harriet Baker was right. You and your husband are (scoffs) hunting ghosts. - My husband is an expert at detecting change in atmospheric elements. - Breathe deeply. (Danielle's heart beating) Mm-hmm, another breath, deep. (Danielle inhales deeply) And you? What is it you do? Outside from fainting, I mean. - Oh, you'd never believe me if I told you. - Try me. - Okay. If I concentrate hard enough, I can communicate with the spirits, feel their presence. Like a heartbeat. - This ability of yours, were you born with it or did you learn it? - I had a skating accident when I was eight and I got trapped under the ice and that's when I started to float. - In the current? - No, out of my body. I rose up through the ice, over the lake, until I don't know where I was and then I saw this white rectangle of light. It was a doorway, it was open. I didn't go through it, I came back. But I don't think the door closed completely. I have this music box that I've kept since then that brings me back to that time. You must think we're pretty weird, huh? - No. But you have to admit, it's some story. - I told you you wouldn't believe me. - I just don't believe in ghosts. - [Danielle] We need to talk about what happened. - Right. Listen, I'm really sorry. I had too much to drink. - No, we need to talk about what happened with Pa- Professor Ballard. - No, there's really nothing to talk about. You had an affair and that's not gonna change. - What's it gonna take to get over this? - I don't know. All I know is that I love you. - I love you, too. (eerie music) (shuddering breaths) ("London Bridge Is Falling Down" playing) (door creaking) (shuddering breaths) (wood clattering) ("London Bridge Is Falling Down" playing on piano) Who are you? (whooshing) (eerie laughing) (suspenseful music) - Oh my God. Watch it! (eerie whimpering) I wanted you to know that I found Samuel's name on the occupant list. Here's a copy for you. Samuel Cartwright, advertising executive, which explains the decor in the rest of the house, married to Elizabeth Smalley, local piano teacher. She's the one who committed suicide with the drug overdose in the bedroom where we sleep. That was after our pal Sam died in a drunk driving accident out on Route 7, so not exactly a safe and secure-- - [Danielle] This doesn't make sense. - What? - Well, ghosts only haunt the place where they died, right? - Right. So we gotta figure out why he came back. - Maybe we should ask him. (camera whirring) - Are you ready? (whirring) (winding music box) ("London Bridge Is Falling Down" tinkling on music box) (children's voices overlapping) (ice skates slicing) (voices whispering) (ice breaking) (young Danielle screaming) (whooshing) (wind blowing) (electricity buzzing) (buzzing) - Samuel? - [Samuel] Elizabeth? - [Danielle] (shouting) Brad! - What the hell? - Brad! - Danielle! (doors slamming) (pounding) (pounding door) (Brad exhales) Did we get him? - It's not our ghost. (foreboding music) (water running) - Danielle, you're just fine. However, I did discover something in your blood test. - And? - I don't think you have a ghost in your house. - What are you talking about? - The so-called presence that you felt. - Yeah? - It's your baby's. - (laughs) Oh, my God, are you serious? - Mm-hmm. (Danielle laughs) Oh! - [Danielle] Hello! - I'm in here. - How's it going? - I think it's pretty good. I just expected better results from an encounter this intense, that's all. - Uh, I have a result you might like. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. - What would that be? - I'm pregnant. - Oh my God! We're hav- you're? Wow! (both laughing) Oh my God, we're having a baby! Wow! Let's go out and celebrate. - I'd rather stay in and celebrate. - Oh, really? - Mm-hmm Ah, my god, what are you doing? - Never got to officially carry you over the threshold. - Oh, really? Ah! (laughs) (both laughing) (eerie shuffling) (door slams) (both laughing) (Danielle yelling) - Yes! - No! - Yes! (Danielle laughing) - Wait. - What? - I'll be right back. - What? - [Danielle] Yeah. - Oh! (Brad groans) Baby, please! - Hey, don't you touch that. - Come on, woman, get up here! (eerie music) (groaning) ♪ Let's get it on - What is he doing? ♪ Let's get it on (Danielle laughs) - Come on, baby, I need you! - [Danielle] Oh my god, you're sick. (moans) (Danielle breathing heavily) (ghostly shouting) - Come on, baby. Come on! (knocking) It's open. (knocking) (chuckles) Okay, I'll play along. (TV zapping) (clock shifting) (crashing) (Brad exhales) - Brad, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. I mean, luckily, I got out of the way. That thing came flying all the way across the hallway right at me. We got this one on tape. What? - We don't have it on tape. - What are you talking about? - I unplugged the feed. - You did what? - I didn't want the cameras recording us making love. - We would have just had this whole thing recorded. - I know, that's what I was afraid of. I mean, I don't want the guys at the Bureau to see copies passed around. - Oh, right, you mean, you mean you don't want Ballard to see it. Okay. Right. (Brad sighs) - I could try contacting him again. - No. You're not doing that. It's too dangerous, forget about it. - But the presence in the basement is not a violent one, Brad. - It's not violent? It tried to attack you! - Exactly. So why would he try to communicate with me by drawing with chalk or by playing music from my snow dome? - Are you saying that we have two ghosts here? - I don't know. But what I am saying is that the presence that I invoked in the living room is not the same energy that's in the basement. And if I try contacting him again-- - Forget about it, okay? We'll just forget about it. (dramatic music) Baby, I'm home. - [Ballard] In here, sweetheart. - What are you doing here? - You're out of school, Brad, you don't have to rebel against the teacher. - What are you doing here? - I came because I'm concerned, Brad. You got three visits this week and no documentation. - What about the sensory exclusions and the time displacement? - Televised spoon-bending. That's carnival tricks, man. You get the spirit materializing in front of Danielle, the grandfather clock being thrown across the room, that is substantial. You wouldn't be holding out on me, would you, Brad? - Samuel's presence created an ice build up on the lenses, okay? It's a classic case of thermal agitation. It's well documented. - Both times? - Yeah. Yeah, in fact, I'm uh, creating a kind of defroster to install on the lenses. - Really? How does that keep the cat away? - What cat? - Well, according to Danielle, today's attack went undocumented because a stray cat pulled the feed out. - Actually, I pulled it out. - And there's a reason for this? - Yeah. Brad and I were about to make love. - Really? - Yeah, I mean, I know it's unprofessional-- - Come on, guys, we're scientists, you know what I mean? - No. - Don't let it happen again. - Are you telling me not to make love to my wife? - Brad. - No, Danielle! Just because he's our boss doesn't mean he can turn his little personal agenda into some kind of a fake professional reprimand. This is nonsense! - You know, apart from your attitude right now, the only thing I find unprofessional is turning off the monitors. They need to be on 24 hours a day if we're gonna document this phenomenon. Which, by the way, is my only agenda. - Well, I thought-- - It is very clear what you thought, Brad. Jealousy's a killer, isn't it? (country music playing nearby) ♪ You won't believe what I've got under that hood ♪ (door shuts) - Excuse me. I'm uh, looking for a guy named Fred Olson. - That'd be me. - Oh. How you doing, sir? I'm uh... With the Bureau of Occult Occurrences. - Fine with me. So long as you don't date my daughter. - Oh, yeah. I'm sure she's really lovely. Listen, uh, you filed a report with us some time ago about the Sunset House. - It was almost 20 years ago. You're just getting back to me now? - We're severely understaffed. Listen, uh, where were you when the phenomenon first occurred? - What? - The ghost, sir, where... You mentioned something in your report that your wife and you were doing the dishes and-- - That's right. All of a sudden, we heard this voice crying out like it was in pain. Even though it was August, the bedroom window frosted over like it was December. - See (chuckles) this is... I'm getting all confused because, you see, you mentioned the bedroom window but you say you were doing the dishes. - (clears throat) Hey, Edna was a little embarrassed about what we were really doing. She didn't want the neighbors talking. (billiard balls clacking) I know things are different now, but back then being romantic wasn't something you'd talk about. - No. - Can't say that I'm too comfortable talking about it now either. - Sure. (billiard balls clacking) - Strange thing is, the only time the ghost ever showed up was when we were uh... (sniffs) - Doing those crazy dishes, right? - You're catching on. - (laughs) I'm beginning to. - When did you actually see the furniture fly? - Well, Kenny would come over. We'd start to kiss and one thing would lead to another. Well, you know. - Yep. As a matter of fact, I do. - You know, it seems like everybody in this town got laid in this house. - (chuckles) Yeah, everybody except Widow McCreavy. - Right, whose one true love was as dead as Samuel. Which could be our pattern, by the way, think about that. (clears throat) Let me have the wire cutters. - Yeah, now we just have to prove it to Ballard. - Screw Ballard. Oh, one of us already did that, I always forget. (laughs) - You know, why don't you just get over it, okay? He's in charge, that's the deal, and it's our job to report it. - Well, see, now I'm just wondering where the job end and the life begin. - You know, I just want to try to prove that we're not completely incompetent. You think we can do that? - Okay, so, so... So you wanna prove it, huh? You wanna get some proof? you wanna get some proof, baby? - Please don't do this. - Come on, look. Let's get him some proof. Don't you wanna get some evidence? You have to get the evidence for the professor, we don't want to disappoint him. Come on, you can. - Ugh, this is perverse. - Think of it like it's in the name of the project, okay? Huh? (woman shouting) Why don't you think about your Ballard if you have to. Maybe that'll make you feel more professional, huh? - Don't you get it? You're the one that I married. (ghostly shrieking) (Brad exhaling) (camera whirring) I love you, baby. (whooshing) - Oh, please forgive me, baby, I'm sorry. (ghostly groaning) (body thudding) (cracking) (Brad shouting) - Sorry we woke you, Doctor. - No, I'm glad you did, Mrs. Gallagher. Your husband is really beaten up. - How long am I gonna have to wear this? - Oh, it'll be off you in six to eight weeks. Just in time to chase away the trick or treaters when they egg your door. (eerie music) (clicking) (clicking) (clicking) - Why are you still watching that tape? - Next best thing to being there. - Oh, what, you can't go a month without sex? - No, I can't go a month without a ghost. He's in love with you. - No, Brad, he's not. I was just another student body to him and that's it. - I'm not talking about the professor, Dani. - Then who are you talking about? - I'm talking about Samuel. - Oh, now you're jealous of a ghost? - No, I'm not jealous of a ghost. A ghost is jealous of me, which is why I keep getting attacked! He wants you for himself. - You're imagining things. - Really? Okay, fine, let's find out. - What? - Let's make love. - Mm-mm. - Then you're giving him exactly what he wants. Because that's what he wants, to tear us apart, and he's tearing us apart! - No, you know what? You're tearing us apart. - Do you understand what it's like when uh... Someone or something is trying to take your wife away from you? I'm gonna have to face him. - You know what, you wanna go face him? Then go dig him up, because he's dead!

(ghostly whimpering) Is that you? (eerie music) (clattering) - Danielle! - [Danielle] No! (booming) You scared him. - (scoffs) I scared him? - Yes, Samuel was trying to tell me something about his death and I think it had something to do with a riding accident. - Danielle, he died in a car accident. It's in the report, he was drunk behind the wheel. - Why would Samuel mislead me? - Because maybe we're dealing with a poltergeist. They're very well known for playing tricks on people. - No. No, there's gotta be something on the computer. I'm checking it out. (Brad sighs) (eerie music) (crashing) (Brad exhales) - Okay, looks like we've officially been egged. Happy Halloween. (laughs) I guess being the only haunted house in the neighborhood makes us a pretty good target. Are you all right? - It wasn't Samuel. - Dani, we saw him materialize. - That's because I summoned him. - Sweetheart, his name was on the basement floor. - But that doesn't necessarily mean he wrote it. I mean, maybe some other spirit is trying to tell us something about Samuel. - Who would that be? - His wife. - Where are you getting this from? - Elizabeth Cartwright taught piano lessons, right? And she could play the song after she heard it on my music box. I think we should try contacting her. - No, we're going to bed now. Come on, please? - Okay. Okay, I'll be up in a minute. - Okay. (egg slamming window) (snow globe smashing) ("London Bridge Is Falling Down" instrumental) - [Man] (whispering) Mother. - Samuel. - Danielle! Dani? Danielle? Are you all right? - I was wrong. I was wrong. I was wrong. - About what? (woman gasping) - Samuel. - [Woman] No! - It's been him all along. (pumping) - Hmm. It looks like this ghost hunting is taking its toll on you. - What do you mean? - Your blood pressure is much too high. - Well, how do you suggest I lower it? - If I were you, I'd move out of that house. - I can't do that, Doctor. - Well, then... There's nothing I can do except prescribe a relaxant. Don't worry, it's perfectly safe for the baby. - Did you treat the Cartwrights? - Why do you ask? - Just trying to understand their relationship. Did Samuel abuse her? - I really don't like talking about other people's private lives, but yes, they were my patients like everyone else in this town and, well, I'll just say she sure got an awful lot of bruises. So did her son. - Wait a minute, they had a son? - Oh, I just assumed you knew. - But he wasn't on the occupants list. - He didn't live there with them. They moved in after they... Well, what I... What I mean to say is when the boy became too difficult to handle, they had to send him away. Poor kid. Couldn't even come back for his father's funeral. - Where is he now? - (laughs) You... You really are persistent. Well, nobody really knows. He ran away from the institution when he was 20, I think. - What was his name? - Samuel. Same as his father's. (dramatic music) - Hello? Brad? (bag rustling) Oh. Brad? (suspenseful music) (whooshing) (wind blowing) ("London Bridge Is Falling Down" on piano) (eerie music) - Morning! (laughs) Well, well, well. Hi, pretty lady. - What are you doing in here? - What do you feel like? - [Danielle] Leave or I'll call the police. Ah! (choking) - You know, pretty lady, they say uh, asphyxiation adds to the-- (both grunting) - [AOL Voice] You've got mail. (whooshing) (crashing) File's done. - What the goddamn hell's going on here? (clattering) What's going on? (Brad panting) - I don't understand why he changed his pattern. - He didn't, though. - Nobody was having sex. - I know, but to a child, the sounds of sex and violence are the same. - A child? - Yeah. The Cartwrights had an autistic son also named Samuel. - Where are you learning all this from? - Doc Hadley told me today when I went to go visit him. Um... Samuel revealed himself to me in the basement today, Brad. - All right, that's it. I don't want you going down there alone anymore. - No, it's fine. I mean, I think I'm sort of like a mother figure to him. (Brad sighs) That's great. Well, I think he's got a built in babysitter now. (Danielle laughs) You're starting to show a little bit. - Yeah. I gotta pee, I'll be right back. - Okay. - Okay. - Do me a favor. - Hmm? - Bring me some aspirin and water. - [Danielle] Okay. (Brad sighs) (eerie music) (ghostly whimpering) (couple struggling) - No! No! (woman whimpering) No! (Samuel screaming) - (distorted) Bad boy! (grunting) Ah! (Samuel screaming) (body thudding) ("London Bridge Is Falling Down") (fire crackling) - Okay, I'll accept that Samuel's father murdered him while he was trying to protect his mother. But that does not justify increased funding to dig up all the stables in Bird Song. - We have reason to believe that he was buried near horses. If we could find the body, we could verify a cause of death. - But what good would that do? The murderer's already dead. If we give the body a proper burial, all that's gonna do is send it into the afterlife. - I think that we should put Samuel to rest. - What? - Well, he's more like a child than a man, Brad. - Well, how? - The only way to put a spirit to rest is to bury the body. I'm just really tired. I'm gonna go upstairs and have a bath. - Okay. I'll be up there in a little while. (Brad takes deep breath) (match striking) (faucet dripping) (Brad clears throat) (piano chords striking) Samuel, are you in there, man? (Brad sighs) You know, she's just trying to help you. I know how hard it can be, you know, to get over something, just let go of it like that. You know, something that... That you been hanging on to, that's hard. Believe me, I know that. (Samuel shuddering breaths) That's the past, you know? You can't do that. You can't hang on to the past. Gotta let go. Gotta let go of the past. (Samuel grunts) (water dripping) (blowing out match) (whooshing) (Brad shouts) - Oh my God! - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. Um, he's underwater. - He drew a wave in the basement. - Yeah? - Map's downstairs. - Okay. - Now, Blue Jay Lake is the only body of water in Bird Song that's deep enough to hide a person. Except it's not near a stable. Or anything that's a stable now. We should get some, like, older maps. - No. Samuel Junior's buried at the bottom of Blue Jay Lake, weighed down by his last Christmas present. - What are you talking about? - His rocking horse. (dramatic music) - I think we've found something. - We're always more gentle with a person after they're dead. Why is that? - This is nice. Right up there with two-headed babies and Virgin Marys on tortillas. Shall we talk? - Brad went into town to get the autopsy report. Why don't you come in and wait? - Yes. (rhythmic whooshing) - You were right about the cause of death. (whooshing stops) Thank you. Samuel died of a cerebral hemorrhage. - How did he get it? - Judging by the pattern of his broken ribs, it was from a fall. Perhaps down a stairwell. Brad, may I ask you a question? - Sure. - How did you and your wife know it would be in the lake? - He told us. - Really? - Yeah. Actually, he told my wife. He's uh... He doesn't really trust me. - What else did he tell you? - Nothing. - Ah. - Thank you, Doctor, I appreciate that. - Ah. Yes. Now, hold on. I want to give Mrs. Gallagher a refill of her prescription. I'll only be a moment. I'm... (flicking lighter) Upping her dosage. She should take two (exhales) twice a day. Preferably before meals. (exhales) ("London Bridge Is Falling Down" instrumental) - I've been watching that videotape you sent me and no matter how many times I see it, I can't believe my eyes. - Samuel's got to be the most active ghost ever documented. - But I'm not talking about Samuel. I'm talking about you. Seeing you on that tape brought back some old feelings and uh... And a new one, too, you know? I mean, I was jealous of Brad. - Paul... - No, really. What we had was more than just some coed conquest for me. It was substantial. And you took me beyond the veil. Do you understand? I mean, you challenged me. Which most people don't do. And you still do. - The only reason I challenge you is 'cause you can't have me anymore. (Ballard scoffs) - Because you're married? - Because I love my husband. And our baby. - You know, I always wanted children. - (laughing) You? Okay. - What is so funny? - You are. You don't want to have children. You want to see your reflection in their eyes, you want to be looked up to and admired. - We all like to be admired. You used to admire me. - And now you disgust me. It's pathetic enough for you to seduce college girls, but it takes a world-class leech for you to come on to a married woman and see if you can get away with it. - Can I? (loud slapping) - I think you got your answer, professor. - (laughs) Yeah. Well, you can't blame a guy for trying, can you? (chuckles) oh, and by the way, I'll be taking this case away from you say um... Monday. It's been swell. - Brad, wait, before you say any-- - No, Danielle, you don't have to say anything. - At least let me get a chance to explain. - You don't have to explain. Now we'll start with Samuel. (foreboding music) Hi. - Hey. - Listen, this is gonna take a little bit longer than I thought. Why don't you uh, why don't you head home? - How'd you get the sheriff to release the body, Brad? - You don't think I stole it from the morgue, do you? I uh... I told them that the Bureau needed to do a little bit more investigation. Why don't you head home, okay? Be careful. Bye. (Danielle coughing) (car starting) (foreboding music) (crickets chirping) (phone dialing) - [Danielle] Dr. Hadley. Hi, it's Danielle Gallagher. Yeah, I'm sorry to bother you, but um, I'm all alone and (breathes deeply) I think there's something terribly wrong. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. (eerie music) - Mrs. Gallagher? It's Doc Hadley. - [Danielle] Upstairs. - What seems to be the problem? - I can barely breathe. - I have some difficulties myself. (suspenseful music) - I um, I shouldn't have made you come out on a night like this. Especially because Brad'll be home any minute. - Well, as long as I'm here, I might as well examine you. - Oh, you don't have to. It's just morning sickness. - Morning sickness? Hmm. You should have been over that by the end of your first trimester. - I'm fine. Brad'll be home any minute. - That's the second time you've said that. - Why did you do it? (Hadley sighs) - I loved Elizabeth Cartwright. She was... The most beautiful woman I had ever laid my eyes upon. (thunder crashing) Jealousy makes us do terrible things. I'll never forget the look in her eyes. Terrifying. Terrifying. - Am I gonna die? - Danielle, you should have learned by now not to ask questions you don't want the answers to. (Danielle gasps) (Brad grunting) (whimpering) - Ah! (Hadley sighs) (ghostly whimpering) (long exhaling) (body bag unzipping) (growling) (whooshing) (dramatic music) - Dani? Oh, Dani, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I messed up so badly. (sniffles) I'll never not trust you again. Please forgive me. (breathless laughing) (Danielle coughing) (Danielle breathing heavily) (suspenseful music) (truck accelerating) (crashing) (Samuel shuddering) (Samuel growling) (tires screeching) (doors locking) - Samuel! Please! - Bad boy. (tires screeching) (crashing) - Ah! (car exploding) (flames crackling) (car arriving) - Oh, Brad! Oh! Oh! - Are you leaving now? - We have to. - Why? - It's time for you to move on, Samuel. (Danielle crying) Go on. It's okay. (dramatic music) (Danielle crying) (whooshing) (Brad breathing deeply) Mm. You all right, Sam? - I love you, buddy. (Danielle laughs) (car starting) ("London Bridge Is Falling Down") - [Samuel] (whispering) Mother. (foreboding music)
