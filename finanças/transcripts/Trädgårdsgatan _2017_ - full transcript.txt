You of all people should know that. What is it for? So hot that SMHI has issued a class 2 warning -on because of the increased risk of fire. A total ban on open fire prevails now throughout the country. What is actually implied by this Class 2 warning? This means that the risk of fire is very large. It is dry in the fields, and it has been a long heat wave. -How dangerous is it? -Brannrisken is unusually high. One must be incredibly cautious. Disposable barbeques do not use. Is there also a risk that things may ignite spontaneously? Well, it's ... To. -What do you want? What the hell do you think? It has to be we. You and I. Can not we stop the drug and tablets? Ok.

Elin! I've been sober for 12 years. And I've managed a week. I have nothing to add. -Thanks, Gustaf. Hi, I'm Linda. I am an alcoholic and drug addict. Hello, Linda. I'm here with my girlfriend who I like very much. I've just been drug free for one day. -Abrupt! Yeah ... What should I say? I feel ugly. I'm in the way. I feel like I can not. And... When I drink, it feels as if everything is just going to burst. That I shall die, sort of. But really there is a greater risk that I die when I geezer. Men... Pardon... It is difficult. But it will be well easier with time, I guess. Thank you, Linda. -My name is Peter. I am an alcoholic. -Hi Peter. I take everything. Shoots time. Call me junkie. I do not care. I am here for Linda's sake. I have not so much memories of my boyhood. But I'll remember when his mother stabbed his girlfriend in a fill revel. That it could be so much blood in an old drunkard! Her mother ended up in prison -and I got to be with the little brother to his father in Jonkoping. Dad was a teetotaler and nyfrelst. He lived with his wife and his kid. I save up the bed, took me by lillebror- -Ba evening prayers and made me. But after a month they threw me out. There was too much trouble. I moved to my alcoholic grandmother. -Elin, stop! Elin! Elin... Are you all right? Did you hurt yourself? I pray so much apologize. Are you okay? Shall you not working? -Paint must dry. Do something, then! Stings and buy ice cream. -Ice cream! -Take the kids. You too, Eric. An ice cream to madam and a lord. -So you've been tobarns dad? -Stop it... It's a long time since you were with Kenta. And you never past the kiosk. Is this an interrogation? Pardon... -Are you ready? -Dont touch me! I should ... I hate when people touch me! Stop it! Peter, let go! Neimen ... Hold up! -What happened? -Peter began to fight with an old man. Then came the police. What the heck are you doing? -I know... You drink away the children! It worked out. -No, it worked out not. I'm ashamed. Really. Is this good enough? You will not fix this. But it do you? I try at least! You're not even trying! Do not you think that it is tiring for me too? I'm drug free, Peter. You are drunk. So, yes! I gotcha. You intend to go. Is that right? Just like last time. It gets a little hard, and then insert. Is that right? You do not get a chance this time. I'm outta here, take Eric with me, and then you see us not ... ... ever again. Not Elin either. No, I'm not going to go. Pardon. Mum has provided a space for you in a care. It's just for a little while. And Linda needs some peace and quiet. Now it is as it is, you see. When Peter comes back, you can also come back. You said you would not stay here. Samuel has got your room. We could not know that you would show up as jack in the box. Good night. This goes no further. I can not. His dad have to take him. The father called evidently Peter Persson. We'll look for him. My little pyromaniac. Like that. Thank you very much. Do not forget to submit this form before Tuesday. Absolutely. -When I say good luck. Good bye. -Thanks. Hello. -Hi. -Hi! -Hi! Congratulations apartment. -Thanks! -Hi. Congratulations. -Thanks. -A gift. -Top! Is it alcohol, or? I'm kidding only.

You can not stay up anymore. Why does Eric shoes, but do not I? He is not your real children! Elin! There were grim. Why should he stay in my room? -But... Tax ...

He can take it with Jesus. -Should not you talk to him? -Why? -Iblant will speak. -It will not. I think if we were to paint the living room. It does not in a sublet. Come an ... Sure, you can. That's fine as it is. Large girl ... Soon I so old that you can drive flossing at me. Why? When I and Linda are old, you and Eric take care of us. -You can stay at mom's job. -Forget it! Try me. Gap like a monkey! Sleep well, Eric. Like a swallow wings ... Law that everything will be as it was before Dad came. -Good night, darling. -Good night. -So big Elin has become. -Yes. Eric too. But special Elin. I need to talk to Mats. Eric must have hit his mother. Mum has fixed a job for you. What then for jobs? -Download containers at a port. -Ok ...

But it turned out that they did not want me. My own father I never got hit. When I got you ... When I swore that I ... That you would never be deselected as I was. Are you listening? I choose you. We get it good in Norway. I'll just pay as we go. Do you want something? -A soda. -Okay. Eric! What are you doing here? Come in. You're completely wet! What have you done? I came back as fast as I could. -Are you cold? -No. Are you hungry? Come on. Sit down. You must have gone to fight far! -What? -It was worth. -You're my horizons. -What? Ugh ... Nothing. -No! -Eric ... Do not try you even fucking! Mother! You are so pretty... Norway, then ... What was it? After less than a year, Dad died. What? What happened to you? Mom did not want me, so it was foster family. I moved from there when I was 16. -The morning you came back ... Yeah. I was awake all the time. -Hi. -Hi. He is sleeping in my bed. He will be with you. We've all talked about this. The answer is no. I'm fighting all that there is. I can not have two children. You're his daddy. Do not you understand? His mother does not want him. And me he relies not on. He has chosen you. How happy I should, so I can not. It is enough with Elin. We can try again ... -Please! -I can not do that. -You have no choice. It's too damn your son! You have to take care of him. -Do not try to give me guilt feelings. -I do not. -I do not. -Yes you do. -No! -Eric ... -Don't try, dammit! Mom! It was not Peter who forced you to Norway. It was the dad said, but I thought that he lied. Although he did not show it, so loved Peter you. Hey, Sebastian. -Peter! Phone for you. -Okay. -Peter. -Hi it's me. -Linda? Yeah, who else? There are many girls who call you at work? What do you want? Can not we try again? Peter... -Are you still there? -Yes. It has to be we. I love you. -Ok... -Ok? I mean, I love you too.
