Out! WELCOME TO HELL Wait here for now. Stay here! These are yours. Vasylenko Lilia Hennadiivna. And Staryi Aidar, everything's as agreed? Yes, we'll bring you five stiffs. Five? We were talking about six. - We haven't found the 6th one yet. - You'd better. They were all at that petrol station together. We'll look. - Borozdianyk. - Here. - Semenov. - Here. - Daurbekov. - Here. - Vashchenko. - Here. Let's go. Off you go. Go! I'm glad to see you. It's good to have you back. Look, let's go to the doctor now for a quick check-up. Then we'll sign a few papers, OK? And then we'll leave. It won't take long. This way. Have a seat. - Welcome back, Lilia! - Thanks. - I'll be right back. - OK. Stick your tongue out. OK... Let me check your pupils too. Give me your hand, please. OK, you can go now. OK, your consent to be transferred to Ukrainian government-controlled territory. Sign here, please. - You have my consent. - Well, this is already Ukraine. Let's see… - How is it going? Who else is ready? - Me. Everything's fine, here. Thank you. Miss Lilia, do you have a minute? A word to the Ukrainians who were waiting for your return? Hello, everybody! Honestly, I don't know what to say. Thanks to everyone who has fought for or is still fighting for Ukraine. It was important for us, while we were there, to feel this support. We are grateful that we got it. So, in a few hours a special Ministry of Defence flight will bring Lilia and other previously released prisoners to Kyiv. You'll be able to get more detailed comments there… We should be going now. - Thank you. - Thanks. Take care! - Thanks. - Let's go. - Let me carry it. - It's fine. Did you miss flying? - Me? - Yes. I've never flown before. This is my first time. - Really? - In a plane. Well, it's necessary. Butterfly's first flight, huh? And how does it feel? Different? Yes! It feels a bit different. WELCOME BACK GLORY TO UKRAINE! GOD, HOW LONG DO WE HAVE TO WAIT?! LET'S GET ON WITH IT! I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING WHAT IS THE COST OF THIS EXCHANGE? We are at Boryspil airport, where a flight from Kramatorsk has just landed. 25 soldiers from the Armed Forces and volunteer battalions are on board. Who were in captivity in the occupied areas of Donetsk and Luhansk. As you can see, after a two-hour delay, the plane has finally arrived, and it looks like the official reunion is about to begin. The former prisoners are anxiously awaited by their relatives. Like the wife of Vladyslav Cherepovets, veteran of the war with Russia. Anxious relatives of Lilia Vasylenko are also here. She is the only woman among the released prisoners of war. The aerial reconnaissance expert nicknamed Butterfly was wounded and captured by the separatists two months ago. Along with their eager compatriots and relatives, Ukraine's Minister of Defence Anatolii Bolbochan has come to meet the prisoners. YOU'RE SCREWED ANYWAYS, BANDERAS GO TO HELL! HOORAY! GOD, I AM CRYING!!! Look, Vladyslav Cherepovets is already hugging his beloved wife. And the legendary intelligence officer lieutenant Anton Vyshnevetskyi. - I'M GETTING ALL TEARY - WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR AGES! - MY BROTHER-IN-ARMS IS FINALLY HOME! - DEATH TO THE ENEMIES! And finally, Miss Vasylenko. UNBREAKABLE WOMAN!!! IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT SHE HAS BEEN THROUGH… SHE HAS BALLS OF STEEL! POOR GIRL Welcome home, Lilia! How do you feel? It's hard to say at the moment. Like I'm here, but still there. I don't know what to say. Thank you. I'd like to say thank you… GOD, WHAT HAPPENED TO HER GORGEOUS HAIR? MAY GOD PROTECT THEM. Lilia, how did they treat you there? It varied. Mostly fine. And were you tortured? - Bastard, I will tell you… - Let's have the next question! HER MOM CRIES SO HARD… Tokha, could you close the window, please? Honey, you smoke too much. Mum! Yes? Tell me about Granny Vira's funeral. Granny Vira? It was a decent funeral. The day was so nice and sunny. It was cold, but the sun was shining and the snow was sparkling. Father Pavlo led a nice, peaceful memorial service for our grandma. And the meal afterward was good, there was enough of everything. Nobody got drunk. She spoke only of you until the end. She didn't want to go without seeing you. That's it. That's it. We're here. Where's Mom? She went out. She forgot to get something. At the shop. - Lilia… - Tokha. What's wrong? I didn't mean it that way. Sorry. Just don't touch me. Sorry. OK. I understand. You need to get some rest. I don't think you understand. I do. You think they didn't call me? You think I didn't hear them beating you? - I don't remember. - But I remember. I remember you screaming. There was one time I screamed. Fuck! Bastards! Fucking bastards! They must die! I promise you, Lilia, I will destroy them! Can I have one? Here. Fuck! I'll make them eat their shit… You should be grateful they released me. There were a lot of people with visible signs like this… They're not alive anymore. It's thanks to Magpie. And probably you too. Lilia, I couldn't do anything then. - I know. - No, you don't. Fuck, I was watching that jeep through the sight… Mom is back. Do you want some yoghurt? I bought some with prunes and seeds. I don't know if you like it. I like everything now. So you'll eat it? Here's some cheese and water, cookies. OK, I'll put this in the cupboard, and this goes in the fridge. Lilichka, here's a bathrobe and slippers and some underwear, socks. Lilia, dear, did you see this? And here? Right, cosmetics. Mom, I'll figure it out. Why don't you both go home and rest? But I thought we… I'm serious. Please, take Mom home. I'm going to sleep. As you wish. OK, honey. You need some rest. Get some rest, darling. Everything will be fine. Mom, calm down. Everything will be fine. I'm just going to sleep. Calm down. - Mom. - Alright, alright, it'll be fine. Everything will be fine. Hello? Yes, that's me. And who are you? OK, I need about ten minutes. Yes, you got it. I'm Synitsyn. Valeriy Andriyovych. - Do you take sugar in your coffee? - No. Guess I was wrong. Shall we talk here? Yes, it's fine. Or should we go for a walk? Will this take long? Well, listen. This meeting is a mere formality. But I have to ask you a few questions. First, do you remember how you were captured by the illegal armed group? Yes, of course I do. There was an explosion. Our unit was blown up, I went flying and then blacked out. I see. Were you held in one place or moved? If you were moved, do you know when and to where? First it was a school basement. But I don't remember the school number. Then I was taken to a detention centre. Lilia, we're also interested in any details you remember. Maybe you heard some nicknames, names, surnames… It's all important. There was a Russian man. They called him Chief. What did you weigh before? How are you sleeping? There are some issues here... Have you had any head injuries? B. B. This will be a bit unpleasant. Lilia Hennadiivna, tell me about yourself. What in particular? Well, there are a number of things. When was your last period? I don't remember. Are your periods regular? More or less. How often do you menstruate? It's been irregular the last year. I see. - Any gynaecological issues? - No. Nothing that you're aware of. Any surgeries, pregnancies, abortions? None. OK. Any infections? No. All right, Lilia Hennadiivna. Let's take a look. Please go to the examination room. Please lie down. Put your feet here. Don't worry. Let's have a look. - Please move your hands away. - Yes, sorry. Relax. It will be easier. No, no, no! - I'm sorry. - Just relax. There you go. Just a bit longer, be patient. No, no. No, it won't work this way. I'm sorry. - Lilichka! - Sorry, sorry. I'm going to examine you gently and you tell me immediately if it hurts. OK. - I see that you have tears. - Yes. OK. What are you doing? I can't examine you this way. Let's try again, okay? - Does this hurt? - Yes. And this hurts. Just wait another moment, dear. Alright, that's all. You can get up. Good girl. Lilia, look, I took a sample. We'll test you for the most common infections, but we still need to get a blood sample in the next room. For the HIV test, you need to wait at least three months. But we can test for syphilis and hepatitis. I'll give you a referral. And you still need an ultrasound. Alright. There's something else I want to ask you. I think I know what you're going to ask. Your uterus is a bit enlarged, but I cannot be sure. Lilia, please. Let's see what the ultrasound shows, okay? Thank you. - Glory to Ukraine! - Glory to the heroes! 54th brigade, Radio. Bakhmut battalion, Butterfly. Oh, Bakhmut! Do you know Beard? Of course. What a soldier! He almost knocked out my teeth at the checkpoint by Marinka. Our chaplain had to intervene. Are you a paramedic? - Aerial reconnaissance. - Oh, so you're one of the birds. Nice to meet you. So what injuries bring you here? No injuries. I'm back from captivity. Right! You're the one Magpie was fighting so hard to return. Well, welcome back, Butterfly! So, what happened next? You want to know? Three killed in action. And you know what's in the news? Wounded in action! - Bastards! - A bit wounded. He called and said there were three KIAs. One of them was 19. The guy's mother called him in the morning. He was holding the phone. What could he say? Bastards! He switched off the phone and put it in the kid's coffin. Well, thanks. You're welcome. Is there anyone from his hometown in the unit? Nope. The boy didn't tell anyone he was going to the frontline. The blood vessels have already formed. Eight or nine weeks. Too late for the pill. Halyna Lvivna will decide what to do next. And what can we do next? Probably vacuum aspiration. But it's up to Halyna Lvivna. Wait a minute. Nah, bro, don't wait for me. I left early to spend some time with Lilia. I don't know. She's not in her room. I'm going to look for her. I said, I don't know. I'll call you later. - Lilia, hello. - Hello. Hello. - How are you? - I'm fine. More exams? Is everything okay? Yeah, I'm fine. There's one thing we didn't get to yesterday. OK. Why are you so early today? I told you, I took off from my training. What training? The National Patrol. It's like a movement, or crew, there are a lot of veterans. There are some guys from Bakhmut, from Torets and other units. We get together, train, and keep the peace. - Is that where you got this jacket? - Yeah. It's nice. And what do you do there? Well, I told you: we get together, train, keep the peace, walk the streets. - We go in patrols... - On patrols. Yes. What else? We put pressure on pushers and hustlers, etc. Sorry. Like the Boy Scouts. Bug off! Boy Scouts? Well, your Ukrainian is great. It's the reading list you gave me. Now that I'm demobilised, I can read as much as I want. Oh, and what books did you like? The Human is very good. And Tiger Catchers is just amazing. Yellow Prince. The City by Pidmohylnyi. I've read it twice. It's fascinating, I can bring it to you. Would you like that? I'll empty this. - I'm going to smoke. - Sure. Yes? Lilia ran off so quickly that she forgot her sonogram. I'll give it to her. Why don't you beat the shit out of me as well? - I should have opened fire then... - Go ahead, beat the shit out of me! And shot you just like you asked. So your jeep got away, huh? What the fuck? Your jeep, I said, is gone. When is the abortion? Did I say anything about abortion? Have I said a word about abortion? I've had some tests. If everything is fine, I can have an abortion. - I'll be right beside you. - How do you imagine that? Fuck knows. OK. - How do you feel? - Fine. Lilia, now I am going to examine you again. Just a bit of patience... All right. Now I will get your cervix ready. It won't hurt at all. Then the anaesthesiologist will join us. He'll give you an IV and you will fall asleep for a while. It won't hurt at all. - Are you nervous? - I'm not. Good. - Katia, is the table ready? - Yes. Thanks. Get the chair, please. Good morning. - Did you measure her blood pressure? - Not yet. Please do. Your arm please. 110 over 70. Her heart rate is 72. It's a bit low, but within range. I am going to insert an IV into your vein. How do you feel? - How do you feel, Lilia Hennadiivna? - Fine. Great. Please give me your hand. Lilia, where are you going? - Take off the blood pressure gauge. - Everything's fine. Wait. Lilia, where are you going? Wait! - Are you Lilia's husband? - Yes, I am. - Here. - You're done already? Follow her! She mustn't be alone right now. Lilia! I'm going to sleep. No, leave it on. Lilia, may I lie beside you for a bit? Yeah. Too bad we don't have a razor. Yeah, Magpie. Ah well. So, do you like it? It's kind of like... Honestly, it's been seven years since I held a pair of scissors. You could have told me that before. - Come on! It's nice. - Well... You're probably right. Let's start dyeing? OK. - All of it? - No, only the fringe. Just the fringe is boring. - Only the fringe. - As you wish. Just be still so I don't dye too much. Sit quietly. There you go, goddess! Now we wait around 10-15 minutes. Have you seen the instructions? - They should be here somewhere. - No, not here. I can't find the instructions, only some prescriptions. They don't say how long to leave the dye in. From the psychiatrist? Phenibut. Trittico. Magnesium B6. They prescribed me the same shit. Trittico always wiped me out. I was like a zombie. What about you? It doesn't bother me. You're incredible. It really doesn't bother you? I'm not taking any of this. You're not taking... What do you mean? Lilia, what are you doing? These things aren't prescribed without good reason, right? I am not supposed to be taking these things. Are you mad? They wouldn't prescribe it if you didn't need it. What exactly are you not supposed to take? OK, there are substitutes for Trittico, but Magnesium B6 is fine even if you're pregnant. That's why I only take Magnesium B6. Good. Why only that? You're not joking, Lilia? How so? Literally. Are you serious? Yes. It's not Tokha's? It's not Tokha's. I'm sorry, but what about getting an abortion? I didn't succeed in having an abortion. Maybe you will on the second try? Maybe on the second try. And Tokha? In fucking shock. I see. Oh, Lilia. Does anyone else know? No. - And you didn't tell the investigator? - He didn't ask. I get it. Listen, Lilia. We can report it as a war crime to that monitoring mission or the Helsinki Union. It doesn't have to be now, maybe in a year, or five, whenever you are ready. I won't let this go until you... You hear me? Thank you. - So you can't take the pills? - I can't. What about therapy? Do I really need therapy? Yes, you do. Let me introduce you to Liza. Who's that? She's very cool. She's from Croatia. She has Ukrainian roots. She and her husband have been living here since the beginning of the war. They help people. She's as crazy as you and me. She works with women who've been through trauma. And with kids from the ATO, and soldiers, through consultations. You'll like her. OK. Introduce me. Thank you. Lilia, we'll get through this. Why are you honking? Look at him! Did you see his number plate? Why are you ringing the bell if you can open the door? I've found my keys. - We bought everything we need. - Put your bags here. And who has arrived? Come here. Magpie's busy, so I'll come greet you. - Hi! - You look great, all jacked up! Come serve with me! No, you'll have to go without me, sorry. God, how boring you've become! Hello! How are you? Let's move. There are too many people here. - Give me something to eat. - No, I won't give you anything. Go into the other room. Your Mom just called to say they're not coming. Screw it. Let's go eat. Let's eat while it's hot. Tokha, will you have some? Lilichka, let me serve you. Friends, we've already toasted to her return. Now let's drink to Butterfly. Yes! Good idea! I wish you health and happiness. Let me kiss you. Commander, stop it! Look, Staffy is turning red, there's gonna be a fight. I'm like her father. You'd better kiss each other already. Did you see how nicely I cut her hair? Let's have the third toast right away! OK. Fill mine up. Well, brothers, don't be sad out there. We'll take care of everything here, and join you soon. - Hey, just don't say that rubbish. - OK, cut the crap. Zabava, come and sit here. Sit down! Faster! - I can't see anything! - Strike! What a cosy room we had! Yeah, with that photo-wallpaper. Look, it's Lionchyk. I cut his hair that morning... And then... Hey, are you crazy? Putting this photo in the presentation! Unrecognisable! This is a beautiful photo. - Our armoured car at the wedding. - You spoiled it. How so? It got even better. - It was the best vehicle. - Fun and smiling. They borrowed the armoured vehicle... I, Lilia, take... I've never seen these before, but I know. And promise you love, loyalty, honesty till death do us part. That priest is amazing! With his techno-haircut. There are very few priests who'll perform a marriage ceremony on the frontline. In bloody wreaths. Won in battle! Don't be silly, they were beautiful. Lilia. Mom, I want you to go home now. - Why? - And also, I'm pregnant. Oh my God! Darling! That's great. I'm so glad for you and Tokha! Oh my God, what news! Lilichka, I'm so glad for you. - You were drinking vodka. - Quiet, please. Oh my God, what news! Is it true? It's good, my dear. Mom, you mustn't tell anybody. Oh. Yes. OK. Right, you shouldn't tell anyone until the twelfth week to avoid the evil eye. Oh my God, Lilia... You're expecting a baby. You want me to go home now? Lilichka, I'm so tired. I'm so happy that you're home, that it's all over, that they don't call anymore, that you will have a baby. Who called you? - Nobody. - Mom, who called you? Who do you think? Those separatist bastards! They called Grandma Vira, too. They texted from your number, Granny, I'm going to be executed. How many times did I try to take that phone from her! She kept saying, No, I won't turn off my phone. What if Lilia calls?" She... She was waiting. Do you think it was easy for me? And you say, "Go home." I'll go. Whatever you want. I'm glad. I'm glad you're going to have a baby. I'd better go wash my face. I'm home. Tarantino! Doggo! Fuck... What's this? Take your dog away. Tarantino, get back! What is this? Why the hell did you take this out? What is it? Can't you see what it is? Two hand grenades, an AK-74, a Makarov pistol, what else... Where did you get it? - Where everybody gets it! - Where's that? - Don't start! - Start what? - Don't you understand? - No, I don't. Explain. - Of course. - What do you mean? Forget it. OK, just tell me. Tell me... Lilia, the third Maidan will not be peaceful, get it? And it will happen 'cause these bastards are out of line! Bitchwolf was pregnant when they shot her in her car! - Not in the ATO, but outside Kyiv! - I remember it very well. You remember, right? And you remember that Flint and Wolf are behind bars for no reason? That Oak will finish in jail? Even Catholic in Latvia is in trouble! The smart ones flee, and the ones crazy enough to try to do something are bullied, intimidated, crippled and killed! We are a constant thorn in their side. And we have to protect ourselves! I got these weapons myself. And yes, the war is not fucking over! I'm sorry for burdening you. It's okay. I'll get rid of it. I promise it will all be gone. OK. Get some rest. It's just... It's gonna be fine. - Combatant. - I already have two free riders. So what? I can't take you all! Handicapped and vets... enough is enough! Shame on you! This girl fought for us! Lady! Are you going to feed my children? Let's go! Enough chitchat! Have you no shame? Don't even try to pay! This girl fought for us, risking her life! I don't need anyone to fight for me. We don't know where and how she fought! All she has to do is take public transport, it's free. She doesn't look like a soldier. This war just makes life worse for everyone! - Let's go! - Jeez, why not just let her ride. Thanks. It's nothing! I should thank you. Do you have a cigarette? You want a cigarette? - Trying to smoke less lately, but... - I understand. You shouldn't have gotten off. You should've kept pressing those bastards! - It's not worth it. - Not worth it? If we don't teach them to respect... It's not worth me getting thrown in jail on their account. Oh, yes. Does bus number 520 go in your direction? No, but you go ahead. When I realised that I was pregnant it was one of the most difficult periods. Tarantino, keep off! My head was full of war, explosions, raids. Go away, it's not for you. But I'm carrying new life and we used to joke that my guys - Hi! - Hi! Would get me a maternity bulletproof vest. I was at the front until the fifth month, then my husband, son and I returned home. Why don't you take off your jacket? Look, I won't be home for dinner. I'm on duty with the guys tonight. I only stopped in for a minute. You're out for the whole night? Yeah. That's how it is. I'm sorry. For a girl at war, the first thing is not to be a burden. Do you want to take some food with you? No, I'm fine. Bye! My nickname was Malysh. Why not Malyshka? Because I didn't want the separatists to know that I'm a girl. Here you go! As a girl, being captured is inconceivable. My comrades were ready to do anything, even kill me, to keep me out of captivity. Sure I like having my nails done, sipping my morning coffee, not thinking about shelling. And reading ladies' style magazines. But I'm not a girly girl. Good morning everyone, National Patrol here. We are going on a quest to save a princess... I mean a forest. Let us know in the comments how the sound is, if you can hear us. - AWESOME GUYS. - NOT ASLEEP AT THE CRACK OF DAWN. Look at this guy. And his unsophisticated tool for saving the forest! He's practically disabled, but he's going to save the forest. He rocks! The sound is good. Thanks for the comment. Guys, please repost if you support cleaning out the forest. Good morning! What've you got here? These are our belongings. Wait, wait! What's your name? Marusia. - Marusia? - Let me through! Marusia, who is this? Your breakfast, dinner or supper? - We don't eat dogs. - Really? Wait, let's chat. I don't have time. Marusia is very busy. OK, guys, let's move on. Where're our boys? Let's catch up! A little fir was born in the forest, it grew up in the forest... NOW KEEP UP! Let's go! Look at this scene! Come on! Tear it down! Come on! Let's clean the forest! What a stench! It smells like urine and dead meat. Tear it down! Tear it down already! THEY SHOULD BURN THOSE HOVELS. Oh, here's the dead meat! IMAGINE SOMETHING LIKE THAT BY OUR HOUSE, REEKING UP TO THE 5TH FLOOR Your Honour, watching the video just now, you had a chance to reaffirm that the defendants were aware that the victim was inside the building, but it did not stop them from further action. The persecution believes it to be sufficient reason to reclassify the case from Article 119 to Article 115 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine with the motive of xenophobia as an aggravating circumstance. Objection! Denied. The court is adjourned until 1 p.m. on Monday, September 13th. Please rise! Let's go, if we tell them now, they will release him on Monday. They won't have time to amend the case by Monday. Tokha! Let's go tell them now! - Halya, calm down! - Calm down, please. I suggest that we tell them right now she's pregnant. They will let him out by Monday. OK, let's try. Face to the wall, hands behind your back! Fuck, Tarantino. Hello, Magpie. Hi. Remember you told me about Liza? Who deals with rehabilitation. Today. Better today. With the little guy? OK. I can't walk the dog. Sure. Can you bring me something to eat? I haven't eaten for two days. OK. See you. Shame! Shame! Shame! One, one-one, one, two, three. Shevchenkivskyi Court has just chosen a preventive measure, chosen a preventive measure... for the defendants of the August attack on a Roma camp. August attack, August attack... Tolia, let's start recording, because they're about to come out. Freedom to Vasylenko! I'm ready. Tell me when I can start. Glory to Ukraine! May I start? Shevchenkivskyi Court has just chosen a preventive measure for the defendants in the case of the August attack on a Roma camp. One of its residents died from the injuries sustained. The judges have decided that all the defendants will be detained without bail, except for former volunteer soldier and ATO veteran Anton Vasylenko. The mitigating circumstance in his case is the pregnancy of his wife Lilia, who was held captive by the militants and freed this past May. Well, I think that's enough. I'm done. Shame! Shame! Shame! Do you intend to return to the National Patrol? Shame! - Glory to the nation! - Death to the enemies! - Ukraine! - Above all! Shit. - Lilia. What the fuck? - I have the same question. - I'm serious. - You think I'm not?! What was I supposed to tell your mother? It wasn't my idea to pull you out of there. Did I fucking miss something? When did you start pitying Gypsies and separatist kids? When you started to think it's fine to kill unarmed civilians. We didn't fucking kill anyone! You're not at war anymore. - Don't smoke in the car. - Why not? You smoke too. Not anymore. Don't smoke in the car. Oh, fuck, we're expecting a baby. What do you want from me? Why the fuck did you tell about the baby?! You think nobody would find out? It's pretty obvious. Hello, friends! So, on Thursday, one of the Nazi raiders who destroyed a Gypsy camp was released and put under house arrest. You may ask what merits his release? I'll tell you! It suddenly turned out that Anton Sanych's wife is pregnant. She is a killing squad member, like him. She was serving a fair sentence for terrorism in a Luhansk People's Republic prison. This is Lilia Vasylenko, Ukrainian intelligence officer and gunner with the nickname Butterfly. In your language it's "Metelyk," right? So why should we give a shit about these dillweeds? Curious people who remember arithmetic from primary school can count how long Mrs Vasylenko has been free. Of course they didn't dare disclose the term of the pregnancy, but you can see with the naked eye that for the fifth month her belly is too big. A logical thought creeps in: maybe this killer squad member has finally received her long-awaited punishment from the militants. While her brave soldier husband, having killed enough children of Donbas, must now hide from just punishment behind his wife's belly, where another such child is growing. Thank you. We have to talk. Let's meet before I leave. OK. Thank you. Goodbye. Can you at least take Tarantino for a walk? Fine... OK, I want to live at Magpie's for a little while. What? I want to live at Magpie's for a little while. Or maybe with Mom for some time. I'm tired. I need a break. - And you are, too. - I'm not tired. No, Lilia. Tokha, you are tired. You are on a bender. You're under house arrest? It seems like you're chained to the bed. To be honest, I would have left earlier, but who would walk your dog? This is stupid. No, it's not. I need a break. I'm tired. - Are you leaving me? - I'm not leaving you. What? - You've never seen this before? - What is it? An elbow, a foot, a hand or a heel. It is even weirder to touch than to see. Gross! Fuck. Anyway, he's about to pee. I'm taking him for a walk. I'll come back and we'll talk. Tarantino! Come here! Lord, what's that smell? What happened? Get out of here. Get out of here right now! - Glory to Ukraine! - Glory to the heroes! Today we have all suffered a great tragedy. Tokha is gone. VOLUNTEER BATTALION BAKHMUT I have no words to ease your grief. Anton was... a man of principle. He was brave, strong-willed, and always saw things through to the end. Some people may not understand his act or may judge him, but all of us, who were his brothers-in-arms, should respect it. Tokha, you once said that you don't believe in the past or in the future, that you live only for today. Well, today you hurt us a lot. And although you're our friend, you're a soldier above all. Here is my final command: hold your position in heaven. We will meet there. - Glory to Ukraine! - Glory to the heroes! Friends and family of the deceased, you may now come and bid farewell. Ukrainian citizen Anton Oleksandrovych Vasylenko has passed away. May fond memories of him remain in our hearts for years to come. Be strong. - Lilia, come sit with us. - No, I... - Don't you want to talk to us? - Hunk! I see you've got quite a belly. You can't even squeeze into your uniform. Hey, soldier! - How did you manage to put it on? - Soldier! I'm asking you a question! How did you get the uniform on?! I was wearing this uniform, Hunk, when carrying you out on my back. What have you got to say about my uniform? We're leaving. - Let me see you out. - No. We'll go on our own. Get some rest. - Goodbye. Call us. - OK. Lilia. What? What did he say to you? Nothing! It's fucking amazing. - What's amazing? - Crying is fucking amazing. Yes, I would also cry it all out. Cry, Lilia, cry. Mom, I'm fine. Olha Serhiivna, maybe it's time to start wrapping up? Yes... We'll give these candies away for the peace of his soul. Somebody's handbag. I'll get it later. Lilia... What's this? Easy, easy. Careful. Let me help. Fucking shit. Don't worry, it'll be fine. We're here. Move it! Face to the wall, hands behind your back. Have you had any surgeries before? Hey! Lilia! I'm asking if you've had any surgeries before. No. - Any allergies? - No. - Chronic diseases? - No. If you resist, it will hurt. Relax. It will be worse if you struggle! Here's the operative site. And here too. Lilia? Lilia? - Let's start? - Speak, bitch! Scalpel. Gauze. Clamps. - Is her heart rate OK? - Yes! We can stitch her up now. Shut up, you bitch. Fucker! - Don't do it, please. Please! - Hands off! - Oxygen? - Flowing. - Good morning! How did you sleep? - Fine. - How are you feeling? - Good. That's good that you feel good. Let me take a look at you. Your little girl is fine, too. She's in the newborn intensive care unit. She's breathing by herself. I think this evening you can finally see her. What would you say to that? Yes... I'm curious. Get some rest. Here she is. - You can touch her. - What? You can touch your daughter. - What is her name? - I don't know. Come on, eat up. Have you tried breastfeeding her again? No, I still don't have any milk. What can you do. Are you done? That's it? Good girl! My beautiful little girl. - How are you, girls? - Hush. - She's about to fall asleep. - Sorry. Look at her, isn't she beautiful? - You're living here, aren't you? - Yeah. Look who's yawning! She has Lilia's nose, see? So pretty! - Better guess where I've been. - Where? Where have you been? - I found Tarantino. - Are you serious? I saw his picture on Facebook this morning, and went right away to this lovely couple. Here, we'll celebrate. They were looking after him all this time. He was in the Podil area. Imagine how far he ran! Poor thing. - You took him back to your place? - Where else could I take him? Here is a soother. My son is in seventh heaven. Shall we weigh her? - Ready to be discharged, Lilia? - Ready. Let's go, or you can just give the baby to me. - I have more news. - What's the news? - Liza got a passport. - Wow, that was fast! I'm surprised too. Maybe because her grandmother was from Ukraine. So that means they can take her from here themselves? In theory, yes. But you'll have to take her away from your mom. I can't imagine. Will you be able to tell her? Well... I'll tell her. And Tokha's parents too. If you want, I can tell them. - Yes, please. - OK. - Excuse me. - Yes? Could you please help me get to the WC? Yes, no problem. Hold on to me. Thank you. What was the code? 38? Are you crazy? After surgery! Lilia, you said you're going to see the baby once again? Please, give this to her. - Mom, how will I do that? - Please, I beg you, give it to her! I bought so many things for her, and I'll give them away. But I made this shirt specially for her. Let her have it. OK, I'll give it to her. - Do come join me soon, OK? - Yes, I'll come. - Don't stick around here long. - OK. It's time. In this whole world we now have only each other. Please, come soon. - I will. - Good-bye! - Lilia! - Good afternoon! I'm glad to see you. Come in! - Mustafa is also here. - Hello. I'm happy to see you. I can't express how grateful we are. She's just fallen asleep. Maybe you want to see her? Yes, thank you. Have you picked a name? We did the moment we saw her. - Marion. - Marion. Marion. Beautiful. Beautiful name. It suits her very much. Do you already know when you are going? I hope I will have all of my documents by next week. Are you leaving for a long time? I am signing contract for one year and after we'll see. I hope in a year we'll be able to go abroad together too. If we pass the language exam. It would be great. I mean... If she asks, when she grows up, you can always... Yeah, of course. We understand. I sent Vira contacts of my colleague here. And he wasn't working in our centre so you have nothing to be afraid of. And you can go on with therapy with him. OK, thank you. Because I feel much better after the therapy, in fact. I fall asleep easily and have no dreams. I'm glad to hear that. And bureaucracy should not be a problem for you. In court, the claim should be enough. Unless the enforcement services try to contact your mother. Don't worry, she won't cause any problems and... By the way... She wanted you... to have these. Thank you. No, I should thank you. OK, I must be going. Don't! Maybe some... - coffee or tea? - No, no, no. Thank you. I have a dog and I have to take him for a walk. What was your weight before? Any surgeries? M. B. B. Lady calling Pound. Lady calling Pound. Requesting permission to begin area reconnaissance. - Recon permitted. - Roger! Ready? Launch it!
