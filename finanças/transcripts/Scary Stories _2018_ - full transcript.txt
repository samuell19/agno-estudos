- Zach? Same place. - Ah, got ya. - Great. Yeah, is that okay? Okay. - Let me tune up real quick, make sure it's good. - Sure. - When I was a kid, I loved monsters. - My mom always let me watch monster movies. Of course, when I saw those books, I had never seen a children's book with drawings like that. I wouldn't be writing monster songs and creepy songs about death if it wasn't for books like Scary Stories to Tell In the Dark and the things that I enjoyed as a kid that influenced me and got me excited about songs about death. ♪ Don't ever laugh as a hearse goes by ♪ ♪ For you may be the next to die ♪ Well that first line obviously is just saying that we're all gonna die and death is what we're all waiting for, death is what we want.

Ever sleepover we would tell these stories, long car trips, recess. - You had to sign up a couple weeks in advance if you wanted to get them. - I know it's the first place that I always shot to when I went to the library, was to look for these books on the shelves and every single copy looked like it has been worn out. - The Scary Stories book is my childhood, a very important part of my childhood. - They still have power now to adults I think, but to a kid they're just this perfect blend of frightening and mysterious and a little bit beautiful, I think. - I kinda felt like I had discovered something amazing and I had to share that with everybody. - Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark were a collection of three books that my dad wrote in the 1980s and early 1990s, emerged out of his interest in folklore, folk tales, folk humor. His efforts to capture that tradition in the United States and around the world for kids and now you have a generation of kids that grew up with these books who are now themselves adults and parents. - Don't be scared!

Those who want to get rid of the books say they're just too gruesome for young readers. More from Susanna Frame. - I was upset by the graphic illustrations and violent stories. - Debate broke out here over death, the devil, and dismemberment, all topics stemming from three thin books of folklore called the Scary Stories by Alvin Schwartz. - And sure, they're gonna be afraid of fires and drowning and strangers, but why do they have to live with this fear that somebody's gonna chop 'em up and eat them? My name is Sandy Vrabel and I am a retired grandmother and mother. I was PTA president at that time. How they were brought to my attention was I had several calls from parents. One of my neighbors, her son had brought home one of the Scary Stories and she said he was being very secretive, and he was in the third grade and she said, "Normally, he didn't have a problem "showing me his backpack, but that day he seemed "very mysterious, and later on when I went to say goodnight, "he was hiding under the covers with a flashlight." She asked him what he was looking at and he tried to hide the book, so that gave me an incentive then to definitely go talk to the librarian. So she got defensive and said I needed to go discuss it with the principal. He said to me, "Well, if you are really concerned about this "then what you may want to do is challenge the books." And then of course, it hit the Seattle media and then it just escalated from there and I thought oh my gosh, this is out of control. - Alvin was thrilled at the publicity he got from his books being banned in some places. He just thought that was wonderful so. Alvin had a number of different jobs with organizations, communications director, editor, he tried a number of different kinds of places. - Then he became a reporter, and I think was the formative experience as an adult in terms of his professional identity. He had the instincts, he had the skills, and the experiences of a really, very good journalist. - It think he loved reporting, inquiry, you know? It was all about finding the answer to a question he had, which was what makes this tick, why is this interesting? And he was a bulldog. He really knew how to do research. - My name is William Simmons Tyler. I was born in Bangor, Maine January 27, 1900. - What I am trying to do, I'm a writer and I've written about 25 books. I'm very interesting in folklore and folk life and what this book is is a book on growing up a long time ago. Did you have any children at all? That's funny. I never heard that before. Where did you learn that? - Well, it's. - You just carried it around with you? - I do remember falling asleep to the sound of him typing on a manual typewriter in the next room. - You could imagine this progression of the seasons cinematically from spring, to summer, to fall, to winter, and the flowers blooming, the leaves turning and falling, the snow and my dad, it just was a constant. You could always just see him in there working away. My dad was writing other books at the time. He lived through his advances on books, so he really needed to have a steady flow of projects and I think that indicates that he himself and his publishers and agent, they didn't really realize, which I think is often true with books, is you can't predict which books are gonna be successful and which aren't. He didn't have a clear sense for many years that these were gonna have the effect that they did. - We really didn't have very much money, so it was kind of touch and go for a while there. - In his lifetime as an author, he wrote, over a 30-year period, he wrote over 50 books. So there were a lot of books. Some were successful, some weren't and these he wrote in the last 10 years of his life and I think he didn't actually live to see most of the success. When I was little and my dad was really just starting out as a book writer and he was writing these books about, more for adults about how to raise children, is really about how he trained himself or tried to train himself to be a father, growing up in an environment where his parents were just literally the worst role model. I mean, he really didn't know anything and it's interesting that he would then pose as an expert in these books. So this is one that I just pulled out. That's when I was about six years old and, or five years old and he was probably 35. He took us out there one day and he makes it clear in more than one book that he hated stuff like fishing, didn't really know anything about it, between this was an example of an activity that one could do with your children, and so he took me and my brother. That's my brother, he's two years older and that's me, and you can see the few little sunfish that my brother caught and he's holding our hand. Anyway, that was a photo that I've had on my desk a lot of my adult life. And then this is a photo of, he only met my oldest son, his first grandchild once, and this was around Christmas of 1991, so right around the time of this controversy at Kirkland and he had been going through chemotherapy for lymphoma, which is why he's totally bald, but had been declared cured. So he's there with my brother holding Daniel. I had friends whose parents were more conventional and successful professionally and had more money, so they were doctors or professors and it was easier as a kid to assess what that meant in terms of status than it was when I had to say my father wrote these weird books, and they all seemed odd to me. None of them were books I really would have read myself. This photo is one that I had for many years. It's from 1986. It's actually, he's there the same age that I am now. I don't know if you see a resemblance or not. So, and at the time, again, as I said, at the time I was 29 and I was pretty estranged from him. I was about to get married, a year later I would get married, but he had to have this photo taken for professional reasons, and he's there, he's actually leaning against the wall of the Firestone Library and his inscription was, "To Peter from his distant dad," which is basically his commentary on our relationship. - Okay kids, let's quiet down now, quiet down. So this is a song that I think you've all heard before. It is one of my favorites, especially around this time of year. ♪ There was an old woman, all skin and bones ♪ ♪ Ooh - Not bad, but let's pay attention to the melody. ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ There was an old woman, all skin and bones, ooh ♪ ♪ She lived down by the old graveyard, ooh ♪ - If you write scary books, they expect you to have fangs or wear a cape or something, and then I walk out. I'm this old guy, and it's disappointing to them, I think. And I've gotten to know a lot of horror writers and my experience is that they're all pretty quiet, normal people, they just like to write, like to make up stories. - For me, the '80s and the '90s, that was a golden age of children's books and particularly children's horror, then along came Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark and kids just couldn't seem to get enough. Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, that's the gold standard. - We were even before Goosebumps when we started writing the Adventures of Bailey School Kids' books, they were pretty uncharted territory if you would, especially for the chapter book level that we were writing for. Marcia was a teacher and I was a librarian, and we felt like if anybody is safe presenting this sort of material to children, a teacher and a librarian would protect children from anything that would be too scary or too horrifying, so they felt pretty comfortable launching their first scary chapter book series with a teacher and a librarian. - Think about the setting. Most kids will say haunted house, graveyard, but the most scary settings are those that are normal settings like a swimming pool, an amusement park, something that is familiar that somehow turns scary and that really gets them thinking about setting and I think it really enhances their ability to appreciate literature, and that's what it's all about. - People call me Stephen King for kids and actually, I'm very flattered by that. Last year at the Edgar Awards in New York, there he was across the room, so this is my chance after 30 years and we went over and introduced ourselves and introduced our wives and I said, "Steve, you know, I was once called "a training bra for you." And he said, "Yes, I know Well, part of Alvin Schwartz's brilliance was that he took all these old folk legends, and myths, and old stories and made them readable for kids. He used what the stories were, but he was able to write in a way that really related to kids, and I think that's his particular genius. - It was October of 1994, Halloween season. I had made a display of all the great Halloween stories for children to check out. The books were flying off the shelves. Children love Halloween season because of the great books. One day, the superintendent of my elementary school arrived with Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark under his arm. He said, "Miriam, I want you to take this book "off the shelf." Well, I was really shocked. Why would you want to take this book off the shelf? He said, "A mother complained." He said, "She thinks this isn't appropriate "for elementary school kids." I said, "Have you read it?" He said, "No, I didn't read it." He said, "You got 10,000 books in this library. "Just do this with me." And I said, "Well, I don't think I'm gonna do that. "What I'm gonna do is this, I'm gonna check the book out "to you and I am going to read it myself. "We'll just give ourselves a little time to read it." I thought well, what this was doing was giving me time to check up on what I needed to do because this was the first real incident that I had ever had as a librarian that might end up at the school board. - I haven't really looked at these books since then. Just looking back at these pictures makes me remember why I think they're just so creepy. Yeah, I mean, , this story, Harold, I remember that one. The illustrations are probably, like I said, the most frightening part of these. Uh, yeah. - Alvin always had the final say with his publishers as to who would illustrate any book he wrote, so he was presented by his publisher with some work that Stephen Gammell had done and he really was very impressed with that and he wanted Stephen Gammell to illustrate his Scary Stories books and a really, really big part of the success of those books were the illustrations. - This is a series of books that opens with an image of a severed head hanging off of a clothesline and all of this stark black and white Halloween-ish, clouds on a gray October day vibe that really stuck in your head. Everybody remembers the illustrations just as well as they remember the stories. - From a story, I think, called the Haunted House, which has a woman with eye sockets. - She's missing her eyes, you just see these deep, gaping eye sockets, her teeth all are all rotted her hair is stringy and wet and disgusting looking. - And she's looking straight at you and making it so difficult to read the words on the other page. Finally, to get through that story, I had to actually put another book over the picture so that I could read the page and finally finish the story and I found it to be very, both beautiful and sad at the same time. I've heard it referred to as the picture that shat 1,000 pants - It's this very strange, pale, bloated figure with this wide, eerie smile and beady eyes and creepy hair and it's just looking right at you, and even as an adult, I can't look at that one for too long. I'm a little afraid it's going to move. - You see the pictures at the top of the story, so before you even read it, it's setting you up and it's a woman in a bridle gown curled up and she has this horrible expression on her face. She's like, a skeleton and her mouth's open and her eyes are gone. I think part of it is yes, a fear of small spaces, but it's also just that expression on her face or what's left of her face grabs you. - The illustration that stands out the most to me is The Thing. You see in this shriveled, zombie-like face, you see the eyes very clearly and they're just staring right at you. - Stephen Gammell's illustrations frequently look directly at the reader, meeting them eye-to-eye. That breaking of the fourth wall is fun in itself, but one of the things that makes that extra effective in horror is because there's this longstanding idea in horror that if you can't see it, it can't see you. It's the reason why children pull blankets over their heads. When these horrors are looking at you, they can see you and they know that you can see them, so it makes them more likely to come out of the book and get you, or at least makes it more likely to feel like they're going to, which is important when it comes to horror. When the books came out in the 1980s, they were illustrated by Stephen Gammell. If you go on the internet, you will find tons of people posting their favorite scary pictures from the books to try to terrify more people. However, a few years back when they did a big anniversary release, they have new art. All over the internet people were talking about this new release ruining their childhood, so the stories weren't the same without the artwork and these new pieces of art, which are very attractive pieces of art just wouldn't give them the nightmares that they expected from a Scary Stories book. There was initially a run on the now out of print, original illustrations copies that lead to Amazon Marketplace prices of hundreds of dollars for one paperback, beaten up old book. - It gave me that early sense of the power an image could have. I've talked to a lot of other illustrators, particularly comic artists who've said similar things, that they really have strong, vivid memories of seeing these images and these illustrations and they have left some mark on them. - It started out as just going to be a simple display. Thinking about the second book, it started becoming larger and larger. I created the tribute to the books simply because it was a major part of my childhood. It was something that I'd always wanted to see in three-dimensional form. A lot of natural elements went into it just to make it as realistic as I possibly could, but stay true to the actual books. He could just transform into these incredible atmospheres with just a simple pen stroke. - Actually adapting the illustrations into photos is bizarre and kind of hilarious because obviously I don't have a skeleton-like bride to photograph. I knew I wanted to start with people. I thought it would be more realistic and a better adaption to start with people and try to get them to end up looking like the illustrations. - And to create the Scary Stories sculpture I've been working on, I've been using oil clay. It allows you to take a lot more time to do it, really wanted to explore this medium a little more 'cause this is what they make the monsters out of in the movies. I decided to sculpt the cover of the third book in the series. They were their own entity floating in space like that and at the same time, they were so versatile in their textures in their completion. - All these shingles are hand cut and hand glued in place. The trees were built from tree roots and just branches that were painted and covered in black hot glue to create the nice sort of tendrils that Gammell likes to give to everything. - I pretty much immediately realized that it was gonna be much more challenging than I initially thought. It's difficult, especially when you're going off of something so iconic and direct like the images in the book. There's a lot left to the imagination and there's a lot to interpret there and I learned a lot about his process and his thinking to line up this one, two-dimensional image, you have to step back and look at it, and on the sketch you see a mound over here on this guy and it's like, how am I gonna make that happen? - Blending the actual head into the ground, that was probably the most difficult part because the way it looks in the book, it looks a little bit different than what I could actually do. To me, what it always looked like and what I always thought it was was the head was actually growing out of the ground. It was like a piece of the ground that was literally growing next to the barn. - I had been doing wedding photography and portrait photography for so long, for almost 10 years. You get really tired doing the same repetitive shot in the same happy setting with the same sun flare and I love doing the colorful work, but I knew it wasn't what was true to my heart and I was really longing to just do something so opposite, so drained of color and just kind of shocking, but still really true to who I am. I always had those stories in the back of my mind and I finally just decided I have to choose these really small windows in my time to just finally do it and it was close to Halloween and I thought it was a perfect time to devote the time to doing it. I have a really strong attachment to the books I read when I was a kid. I was convinced that I was illiterate. My teachers made me feel awful for the fact that the books they assigned us, I never finished and I remember we had a reading chart in our classroom where when you finished a book, you got a gold star on your name and I got really insecure that all the other kids had so many gold stars. Here I was with like, three measly gold starts which I'm pretty sure I lied about reading those books to get those gold stars 'cause I felt so insecure. So it was the first book that I felt like, not only am I so into this book, but I'm gonna finish this book and I'm gonna get that gold star. - As a kid, your imagination is all you have to get by. It's like, as a young artist, it was validation to keep exploring this type of, that this avenue was okay to pursue. - I feel like their mind and I see someone else doing an ode to them, I'm like oh, but it's my thing, it was my childhood! - Imagining his incredible artwork, that was probably the pinnacle of the toughest task I had ever, ever tried to create. I mean, you can't get close to what he presented. That's his work, that is his absolute work, that's his style, that's what he created and trying to go off of that, it was just damn near impossible. - Even Gammell remains a figure of much interest and mystery to everyone. He's a very private person, and so there are really no extant interviews available with him. He doesn't give interviews, but we do have an interview he did do many, many years ago. He tells you not everything about him, but it gives you a bit of a window into who Stephen Gammell is. The first time I read a manuscript, I can immediately tell whether I want to illustrate it. I may not know how the illustrations will look, but I get a certain feeling from the text. I respond to the words, and if I respond to a story, I can illustrate it. My first concern is to serve the story. That is an illustrator's job. I don't research unless I have to because I prefer to draw from my imagination. Whatever I draw, whether it's a buffalo or a chair, I try to make it my own to satisfy myself. I prefer to work alone, without feedback from the author. I believe that once a manuscript is written and accepted, the writer's work is over. Unless you collaborate on a book from its inception, talking with authors can create problems over artistic interpretation. When I illustrate a story, I want to work with my ideas and my perception of the words, not with the author. While I had no notion of what an artist was, I did have an awareness of illustration from an early age. I used to lie on my stomach on the floor of the solarium and draw soldiers, airplanes, trains, and semaphores as well as the usual cowboys and Indians. As years go by, you retain what is interesting from childhood and toss out the rest. I tried to get through high school by drawing, too. I'd turn in book reports with illustrations, thinking the teachers would be impressed, but of course they weren't. - I know they're on the banned book list, so we weren't really even allowed to necessarily have them when we were in school, and then we just kind of would sneak 'em into school. We'd limit TV, I'd read to my son every night. It's incredibly important, just so they build that imagination and learn how to make landscapes in their head and it makes them more creative in my opinion. I don't really see a kid going out and scooping somebody's brains out, you know? It's just folklore, it's fun, and if a kid can build his imagination by reading versus playing a video game or watching TV, then I'm all for it. I actually came to Sam with the idea for this entire sleeve at once and I put down, I paid for it in full and I p.m. said this is the idea I have. There were certain illustrations that I definitely, definitely wanted and then then other ones were kind of just like hey, let's see what fits and looks cool. I think my favorite Scary Stories tattoo is probably the church, just because it is like, so detailed, just down to each shutter and down to the cross on top. It's probably my favorite. That's the one that I get the most compliments on of all pieces that are excellent on here, that is the one that stands out the most to people. It kinda hits a soft spot in most people because they're really excited about the books just like I was. - This artist in particular, he wears a very unique hat so to speak and asa I've been an artist my entire life, so for me to try to put myself aside and literally mimic this artist's work, it's difficult. It mirrors a lot of my style. I like the macabre, I like the dark. I think it's interesting. Beyond that, it's just fun. - He was very, very dark, but that darkness, you sit there and you look at the images and you can keep finding things, and finding things, and finding things that's in one image. The more you look at it, the more things that you find. I have a two-year-old right now and I think I would definitely let him read these books when he's ready. They almost teach you a little bit about how to be more expressive and just put more details into everyday life and I think it would be a really, really good thing for him. So, if he has nightmares, I'm there to comfort him. If he has questions about things, I'm there to answer them for him. I'm not gonna shelter him from scary things just because I don't feel like he's ready. So when he's ready, he's ready - The superintendent walked back in and this time he said, "Miriam, let's go back "to your office in the back of the library," and I thought this is not going well. So we went back and he sat down at the desk, leaving me to stand. And he said, "Miriam, I'm going to ask you "to remove this book from the library." And I said, "I don't think I can do that. "Did you read it?" "No, I didn't get a chance." He said, "you have thousands of books in this library. "Why would you stake your career on one scary book?" And I said, "For every story, it has the region "of the country that it came from, it has the tradition "of it, I don't have anything else in the library like this. "I think that I can defend this book." "Well," he said, "I'm gonna have to get back to you. "I'm gonna have to talk to the school board. "The school board meets in two weeks, "probably this'll have to be part of the meeting." - Hey, do you guys want to hear a scary story? - Yeah! - Yeah, so. - Okay, so one night as this young girl was sleeping in her bed, a spider crawled across her face and it stopped in her left cheek just for a few minutes and then it went off on its way. Now the next morning, the girl woke up and she looked in the mirror and she noticed a little tiny red spot on her cheek, so she went to her mom. She was like, "Look at this, what is this?" And her mom said, "Oh, it looks like a spider bite. "It'll be fine, just don't scratch it." But soon, the red spot turned into a big gross boil. - Uh! - And the little girl went to her mom and she was like, "Mom, look at it now!" And her mom went, "Oh yeah, that'll sometimes happen. "It's coming to a head, you know, like a pimple?" But soon, the boil got even bigger and she went to her mom and she said, "Look at it now, it hurts and it's making me "look so ugly!" And her mom was like, "Okay, we'll have the doctor "look at it, maybe it's infected." But then the doctor couldn't see her till the next day, so to calm down, the girl decided that night that she would take a nice, soothing bath. So that night as she lay floating there in the warm water, the boil suddenly burst and out swarmed a whole bunch of little tiny spiders from the eggs that had been laid in her cheek the night before." - The Red Spot is a story about a young girl named Ruth who discovers, she thinks is a pimple on her face. A lot of that story has to do with the fact that we're often afraid of what our body is doing, the changes our body is undergoing and that's something that I think kids can appreciate and even teenagers 'cause when you're in elementary school, in middle school and high school, your body is constantly changing and evolving and your arms are too big, your legs are too long, your head's too big. You're always growing and changing and it's something that you can't control, you have no control over that and a lot of times, that can be scary. - Breaching the integrity of your own skin and then having babies come out of it, the mom doesn't recognize it for what it is, it grows like a pregnant belly and then you have a lot of babies. It's an obviously flawed understanding of how babies come out of moms. That is a horror, that's a place of horror when a body morphs, it's a mythic understanding of how babies come out. It actually is mythic, it goes back to Zeus who has a splitting headache, cracks himself on the head and Athena springs full blown from his head. These stories circulate because they have these existential ties. - Donald and Sarah went to the movies and then after the movies, they went for a ride in Donald's car, so they parked up on this cliff where they could see all up and down the lights of the valley. It was beautiful and just as they were grooving to the tunes, a news bulletin broke in. A murderer had escaped from the state prison and he was heading south on foot armed with a knife. Now the murderer was missing his left hand and in its place was a hook. - The Hook is definitely a parable for what can happen when a boy and a girl are left together unchaperoned, whether it is something adult that happens like premarital sex or whether it's just simply the idea of it. No, it's not proper, you shouldn't be doing that yet. Similar to the other stories about the wreck, there definitely seems to be a warning against teenagers in cars together. - The moral that that story tells is don't go to lover's lane, don't experiment with sexuality while you're young and while you have to be doing it in a secluded, isolated area. - It was nine o'clock in the evening and everybody was sitting on the couch watching TV it was Richard, Brian, and Jenny, and Doreen, the babysitter, they were all hanging out and then the telephone rang. - And he says, "I'm very close to you," and she hangs up and about two seconds later, the operator calls back and says, "Get out of the house. "He's in there with you." And I remember that was the gotcha moment at the end of the story and even just thinking about it brings up goosebumps 'cause I think that's everybody's nightmare, is the idea of having a crazy person in the house with you while you're looking after little kids and you're by yourself. - When you're a child, domestic spaces are stable, and they're familiar, and they're comfortable because you're in the house with your parents, all your things are there, it's where you have dinner, it's where you play, and so it becomes a safe environment and in a lot of gothic stories, that environment is often invaded by terror and anxiety. We can see it in the story The Voice, we can see it in the story Oh, Susanna where we think everything is safe. Suddenly, our world is flipped upside down and a murderer could come in and chop your head off or in the story The Babysitter, there's a guy upstairs on the phone calling down. And so there's a sense here that you're never really safe, you may think you are, but you're not. - When it got hot in the valley, Thomas and Alfred would bring their cows up the mountain to this beautiful pasture to graze. And so one day, Thomas had this idea. He was like, "Let's make a doll the size of a man. "It'd be fun to make and it would scare away the crows. "What do you think?" And Alfred was like, "That's a good idea. "You know what, we should name it Harold." And Harold was the name of the farmer that the guys just hated. - Then they decided there must be some field mice inside of Harold or something, so they put him back out to do his work, brought him in the next day and they heard Harold grunt again. And now and then over the next few months, Harold would grunt a little bit more and one day he even began to talk. Then one day, one of the two farmers woke up and his partner was missing, and he looked around and tried to find him, but he couldn't find the partner and he couldn't find Harold anywhere. But then he looked up onto his roof and there was Herald, spreading out a bloody skin. - One of my favorites is Harold. - Harold. - Harold. - Ooh, I know this one. - Of course. - Yeah! - Harold. - Yeah. - What do you remember from it? - The nightmares. - One of the reasons I think I like it so much is because it's very timely 'cause it's a story about bullying. - It gave me nightmares because of course, I was a little girl, I had a lot of dolls and all I did after that was think about different ways that they might come to life. - Sometimes we are the ones who are responsible for making the monster who they are. - This biography was published some years ago and I gave the publishers this photo, but you can see that it's the same one, yeah. He thoroughly researched all of his topics and investigated many different sources. Schwartz did a lot of his work at Princeton University's Firestone Library. While researching, Schwartz looked for patterns. What did many of the folk tales have in common, what similar elements were present in stories from around the country? - From a very young age, as soon as I could read, I was very tuned to my grandfather's books and the Scary Stories books. - A lot of my relationships with certain people that I know is founded on the fact that they love these books, so whenever they see me they're like, "Scary Stories guy!" I'm like, yeah. Growing up, I never really saw in light of them being widely banned, I just saw them as stories that my grandfather collected. I think now I see them more as, the banned books, as part of their legacy and I think now that is the point of pride for me, the fact that they were widely banned. I think that that validates them. This is Firestone Library on the campus of Princeton University, where my grandpa used to research his Scary Stories books. - Alvin Schwartz drew on all the folk legends and old folklore, folklore from everywhere and he found variations of the stories, which I think kids find really interesting and I love that in his books. My sources, I think, are completely different. We were opposites in many ways because his books were so completely researched. He would spend a year researching these old ghost stories and old legends from all over. I've never done research in my life! - Another wonderful thing about Schwartz's work is those links in the back that he gives to collectors' work and what's marvelous from a folklore and literature point of view as a scholar is how I see children interact with that. You get a child that's really precocious and interested in the world, if you flip to the back and you see that source material, you go, oh jeez, I had no idea that they told folktales in Guatemala or India or wherever the place may be and now suddenly you have a source and if the child is lucky enough to have the internet at home or to have a university library nearby, they can go and they can bring in those collections and they can read and have their eyes opened in a way that they never had before. - They played all sorts of foolish pranks with it, smeared it with cream and pudding and finally went so far as to baptize it. Now it came to life and began to talk. - One of the more interesting dimensions of that story is that in the original source material, they baptize Harold when they create him. What's especially interesting with Harold is the connection between the baptism and Napoleon. It's sort of weaponizing baptism and it becomes not a type of liberation, but it becomes another form of control, then that's potentially Promethean. I mean, that's like stealing fire from the gods and it's dangerous. - Some stories verge on straight jokes. There are dozens of stories of this type. A man calls up a woman on the fall and tells her he's coming up to her apartment. She asked who he is and he says, "The Widow Viper." - One of the stories in the Scary Stories books that I think mixes humor and horror so well is The Viper where there's a woman who is in her apartment and this man keeps calling her and he says, "I am the Viper and I'm coming upstairs." And she's like, "Oh no, the Viper!" That sounds like some kind of serial killer or maybe a monster snake. And so she calls the police, but the guy comes upstairs first and then she opens the door and he's standing there and he's holding a bucket and a rag and he says, "I am the viper, I am here vipe your vindows." And so in my head anyway, he always had a Transylvanian accent. - The Vindow Viper is probably my favorite story from the Scary Stories books. It really reads like a joke with a setup and punchline and what the humor does is it sort of brings the narrator to the fore at the end of this story, really a cathartic feeling when you hear that and you're just like, sigh of relief and the humor really brings that out. - The stories can be linked to the local environment, it can be linked to the cultural environment, but what's really interesting is they take you right to the edge of your seat and suddenly ah yeah, it's the Viper. I vant to vash your vindows, and it's not a big deal. They're gonna come wash your windows and what's happened is you've been taken right along the line of belief right to the point where you expect this to be like every other legend. I'm gonna be challenged. But the way you're actually challenged your expectation is challenged, and that's where that subtext of humor comes in. - There is a saying, he who takes a trip has something to tell. The teller of the legend takes a trip to a very different world, one which lies beyond the mundane reality of everyday life. - So that kind of Eastern European, German-esque changing of just a consonant sound gives a story that could be very well placed in many locations across the United States 'cause the German influx settled in many, many different places and it gives someone the chance to think about outsiders versus insiders, one of the really neat things about folklore and then one of the things that's a little bit touchy we well is when you have a whole lot of people who are very similar, then the world is supposed to be one way, we have one point of view. Scary Stories are a place where we can challenge ourselves with points of view from away. They may be other regions, other countries, somebody who speaks a foreign language and eats really weird stuff and you're not really sure what it is 'cause you don't recognize the name in the other language. - My name is Gary Fine, I am a professor os Sociology at Northwestern University. I believe it was about 30 years ago that I received a phone call from Alvin Schwartz. It was kind of exciting, I have to say. I was a young scholar, I have to say, and to see my name in print in one of the series of books that was aimed at children, Sam's New Pet is a classic rewriting of the Mexican Pet legend, and this is a legend that perhaps today is even more relevant than it has ever been. It was really spread widely at first in the 1980s, but why would it have been spread at that point? It is a story about naive Americans who go to a third world land and admire the people there, but also they decide against the laws. Illegally, they will bring one of these foreign animals, these foreign creatures onto American shores. And of course, the story is about how that seeming act of kindness is dangerous, and this is a story that was relevant in the 1980s when we had discussions about immigration and remains relevant today. - The really interesting stories that are the challenge, taboos, and expectations about culture are the ones that focus on the people from away 'cause you don't really know what they think, you don't really know what they believe, not really sure what they eat, not really sure how they think about morality. They might sell you a diseased rat as a hairless dog. - The Scary Stories tales include a number of stories taken from right here in the Ozarks of southern Missouri and northern Arkansas. The Ozarks experienced the Civil War in a manner very different from much of the rest of the country. And one of the old tropes about the Civil War is that it was a war fought between neighbor and neighbor and brother and brother. In most parts of the country, that's not really true. Most of the combatants didn't actually know the person they were killing or who were trying to kill them. Here in the Ozarks, it very often was the case. So by the end of the war, that left the population of southern Missouri and northern Arkansas deeply divided amongst themselves. It left a legacy of bitterness and mistrust and it comes through in the art, the songs, the stories that people tell. So for example, in the story Alligators, you have a story about a young woman who marries a man, actually has two children with him and it turns out he is a shape shifter of some sort, he goes down to the creek at night and he goes swimming and when he gets into the water, he turns into an alligator. And not only that, but his sons do. Well, what is this story trying to communicate to us? The sense of extreme anxiety that people had over who they could trust that affected even some of the most basic relationship decisions. The story Wonderful Sausage is taken from an Ozark folk story called The Bloody Miller, collected by Vance Randolph. There's a proprietor of a gristmill much like this one who gets into a fight with his wife. He kills her in a fit of rage, he grinds her body up and sells it as sausage. In the process, he discovers that human meat makes the best sausage. Of course, not everybody had the means or the wherewithal at that time to make their own sausage. That meant that you are trusting somebody else with what into your belly. One of the interesting thematic connections between a story like The Bloody Miller and The Cat's Paw, Little Black Dog, is the issue of mistrust and also social anxiety, the idea that you don't always know what your neighbor, your friend, or even your significant other, your spouse, is capable of. - I remember the last time I saw him, the cancer had gone into his brain and he had a few weeks to live. He didn't really know that. And then we drove to the airport and I got out and I knew that I wouldn't see him again and I had this strong impulse to tell him that I loved him and I wasn't able to do it, and I just remember walking away and that was it. - Death in children's literature is a perennial theme. One of the themes that is most affecting, that is one of the themes that appeals most to our imaginations through our emotions, but it also is fascinating for children in terms of helping them develop a sense of self. Some kids are incessantly curious. They've really got that hyperactive epistamaphilic impulse. They want to know well, what does it look like to be dead? Not just what happens after we die. They don't want some nebulous, we're all, you know, we turn into spirits. No, I want to know about the worms crawl in, the worlds crawl out. - I was in a discussion just a couple of days ago, you know, the cremation versus burial debate and what came to mind but that particular rhyme, the worms crawl in, the worms crawl out. Children need these outlets. They need to have platforms. Verse, chant silly songs that enable them somehow to banish their fears. The young are precocious, they know that people die, but nobody will talk to them about it. - The importance of giving a name and a face to our fears is the first way to come from because if you say to a child oh, that will never happen, do you know what? Sometimes it does, but what we can do is give children the power to acknowledge what they're feeling. It is wrong to say that there is nothing to fear. There are all kinds of things to fear. Anything that can happen that's going to help us figure out how we can begin to control it is really, really important. - The next day was Halloween. We have a parade at our schools. I was just getting ready for the morning. The principal comes tearing into the room. She says, "Miriam, Miriam, you have got to see this!" And I go running out of the library and coming up the driveway is the complaining mother with her two daughters. The third grade is dressed like a witch and the kindergartner is dressed like a skeleton and they're carrying ghost balloons for their classroom. Well, as part of the day's festivities, we took pictures of children, including the third grader and the kindergartner, which we then printed and gave to the superintendent. The superintendent had the mother come in and suggest that probably she needed to withdraw her complaint that it was totally ungrounded. - Parents and teachers in a Seattle suburb will vote next week on a plan to ban three books from an elementary school library. Those who want to get rid of the books say they're just too gruesome for young readers. More from Susanna Frame. - I was upset by the graphic illustrations and violent stories. - A debate broke out here over death, the devil, and dismemberment, all topics stemming from three thin books of folklore called the Scary Stories by Alvin Schwartz. - And sure, they're gonna be afraid of fires, and drowning, and strangers, but why do they have to live with this fear that somebody's gonna chop 'em up and eat them? - Parents behind the book say this is a clearcut case of censorship and that the tales are actually good for their children. - Back in 1993, I was a children's librarian at the Public Library and some moms who lived in Kingsgate that was right close to my library got it in their heads to challenge the Lake of Washington School District for having he Alvin Schwartz books in the school libraries. - Suddenly I was not just a concerned mother, I was a censor because I wanted to ban these books. - And so the Lake Washington School Board had a hearing. The school librarians asked me if I would come too as the local public librarian and also because I had a PhD in Folklore and I could speak about the oral tradition and the history of these stories and maybe get a little background there. - Parents behind the books say this is a clearcut case of censorship, and that the tales are actually good for their children. - There's no way they can think about what happens once a person dies and they're in the grave. Do they rot? What happens when you die? You rot. Can you talk about it? Uh-uh, but kids thing about it and these stories help them think about it openly. Which of course is the crux of the whole thing. Our kids don't get to hear that you rot when you die. - It's about age appropriateness. I'm not saying take them out of all libraries, I'm just saying take them out of elementary school libraries. They do not belong there. The committee said we're gonna keep the books. I said okay, then I'm gonna now take it to the school board because that was my other alternative 'cause that's what they said to me, take it to the school board. - There were many cases of school boards debating whether to keep Goosebumps in the school library or not and I'm happy to say that in most cases, the books were kept on the shelves, most. There was a wonderful, now it was in Minnesota, I think, where a school board was going to take all the Goosebumps books away from their schools and it was on C-SPAN. - William W. Garrison Franklin. - And a father stood up and he had a big stack of Goosebumps books. - My name's Bill Garrison. My daughter goes to Franklin. I'm unable to read to her for the simple fact that I'm a single parent and I have no time to read for her, but these Goosebumps collection that I have here, which I have not seen one tonight, encouraged her to read and if they're taken off the shelves, then I'm afraid she's gonna lose interest to read and is gonna end up like me without a decent job because I have no education. - I want her to be able to read what she loves and I'm home in tears watching this guy. I'm like, it was amazing. - If the kids choose to read 'em, more power to 'em, if the parents don't choose to have 'em in the home, more power to 'em. I'm one for to keep 'em with the books. - Thank you. - One thing you notice about book hearings is that people are very passionate at them. - That's disgusting! This is disgusting. - I think we're gonna call a recess. - Now don't. - I have been coming to board meetings for 11 years! - Don't touch her. - It's absurd! Everybody's playing around about what the context of this is. Nobody's talking about censoring the book, nobody's talking about banning the book or burning the book or anything. - If they would engage in sex, as it is suggested in these books, the students are well on their way to catch STD. - I have to tell you though, I was thinking that when I was younger, around 13, if it would have been so easy to find the dirty books in the library because they were labeled, that would have been perfect. That would have been great. - Our children exposed to explicit, filthy, racist things. - There's emotion, there is anger. - The ending part says the wood cutter took a pair of scissors and cut open the stomach of the wolf to free grandma and Riding Hood. This is scary and gory for kindergarten. - There is disgust, there is self-righteousness. - These children came from our wombs. You have them as teachers for a small part of a day. We have 'em for a lifetime. - Parents come in armed with the books marked with passages. Maybe they're highlighted, maybe they have Post-It notes in them, they're ready to spout off all the words. Maybe they counted all the curse words. - I'm going to read out loud some information and excerpts from the book The Handmaid's Tale. This book has 300 pages which contain some of the following. - People want to get up on that soapbox and say I am so much better than this book! I don't read this smut. - Seven sex acts, 64 sexual allusions, 11 references to suicide with three being carried out, others include drugs, drinking, smoking, and profanity. - We all have to be able to stand for almighty God and be judged for our actions. That being said, I'm very concerned for every one of you and everybody in this community that is willing to place this type of material upon our children. - And I don't want to necessarily stand up for curse words or sexually explicit scenes or violence. They use these words that are not true to the book. They'll say that this young adult book that is a best seller and was turned into a movie is pornography. It's not pornography, there's a sex scene in it. It doesn't make it pornography. - What's so fascinating about them is that people are talking about reading and the act of reading and how much it has influence over someone's life. - And too often the only support these young people can find is in their library where they can read from a book that there's someone else who's experiencing the same thing. - Reading is one of the most powerful practices that we could do and that's what you see at a book hearing, is the passion that people talk about books. I've found, when I studied book censors, is that it actually changes with whatever's going on in society, and often this happens in times of strife. So one time was during the Civil War, during the World War II. What we see in the '80s was of course the rise of the religious right. There were all these scares about sickness in your neighborhood where there was like, ritual child sacrifice taking place in your suburban neighborhood. It was just in the ether then, so of course because you were hearing on the news that there were satanists in your neighborhood, of course, you would be concerned about books that seemed to touch on these ideas. What I'm seeing now as we move towards a more multicultural society is you see more books about LGBTQIA populations about ethnic minorities, those sorts of books are what we see now that are being challenged. - If those stories get lost and get replaced by artificial stories, then I think we've lost something. It's not that these are nice stories, they certainly aren't and perhaps some of these stories deserve to be put on the dustbin of history, but they are still authentic, authentic tot he groups themselves and I would hate to be in a society in which children's stories are so thoroughly controlled by adults. - Dealing still with issues of identity that have to do with how you, many ways, still how you think about your parents is connected with how you think about yourself and despite the fact that he had written all these books and had his ups and downs and still was at it and this was how he supported his family through the years, I just didn't understand what his goal was as a writer. I remember being in the living room with him and I was probably in my early 20s and telling him that I felt like he was, let's see, what was it? Basically I said I don't think what you've done is worthwhile, I don't know why you don't do more ambitious projects. I basically said these are small little works of no consequence, and I was probably in graduate school at the time and doing things which I imagined to be of enormous consequence and I remember, it must have hurt a lot. He looked at me and all he said was, "You don't want to know "what I'm thinking about you right now." And I'd like to say, because I was in my early 30s when he died, I'd like to say that we had repaired our relationship by then, but it wouldn't be true. - And then I found out that Alvin Schwartz had been invited to come to our young author's conference and I said, "Well, I would certainly like to meet the man "to ask him that question, do you feel "that these are appropriate for our age group, "for five to 11-year-olds?" But then he got sick and passed away, so I never did get to ask that question. I don't feel that it is. I've seen so much of the violence that was also in these books. It think it's affected our society. I don't want to blame all of the violence, but it's like, it made it okay. I guess I would ask Peter the same question. How do you feel that it's age appropriate for elementary school level? - Oh, it has this wrapper on it. Just unwrap it. - Yeah. Can I? I need to start. Let's just start. - I'm actually channeling my father right now. - Let's start. - He would have been a wreck doing this. Sandy was like, the spearhead of this movement in Kirkland 25 years ago and it was almost 25 years to the day that they had their hearing which I know the Seattle Times when they wrote about it talked about the length of the hearing, which was like seven hours was a scary story, terrifying in itself that people would have to sit through that. So I'm really interested in all the time that's passed to recapture some of the energy and the concerns. Hi, Sandy. - Hi. - I'm Peter Schwartz. - Hi Peter. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. - Yeah, thank you so much for coming up. - Yeah, sure! - It's great to have you come up and it's kind of amazing after 25 years. - I know, I know. - And I would love to learn more about your experience and how it seems to you now from this distance in time and what you were thinking or what made you decide to come up. - I think because I felt like the whole story hadn't been told. Being parents, the schools are always asking for our opinion on how do you feel about this or at the end of the year or during conferences, is there anything we can do better? But then when we actually say something, I feel like they're like, we don't want to know. I got phone calls from parents. That's how I initially found out about the books because the kids are talking about this on the playground. They're upset about it. It's not that I want them banned or censored or whatever, I just don't think they're age appropriate for elementary school children. That is my question to you, do you feel that they're age appropriate? - Well that's, I mean, it's a really good question. I don't have a single answer, but I do understand the concern and the kids that talk about it now are the ones that remember it as like, as some of them I remember said in the Kirkland situation that these are the books that got them excited about reading. Kids don't read as much as they used to. That is very upsetting to me. I don't care what they read. I'd rather they read than just be... - Ah, my grandsons love books. - That's huge! - You're a censor, your a book fan, or whatever, you don't really want to hear what our true feelings were. - He had always had an academic perspective on them. He, I think, loved the attention that he got and the illustrations are brilliant, but in many ways. - They're frightening. They were frightening. - Yeah, they were terrifying, but I mean, he's a genius. And when you give your kids over to a school and we have a crisis of institutional legitimacy these days where everybody's saying all of our public institutions have failed, and how do you balance the issue of decision making and control? But a lot of it had to do with people who were saying it was satanic or that there was, it was not so much about what's age appropriate as that this is stuff that is contaminating, it contaminates our entire culture, our heritage, our religious beliefs. It's an offense to our existence. - I know that there was a couple of people that brought it up, the demonic, and I guess I don't know why that's even in there. To me, it's like why do you want to even? But if it was folklore, it was just to me a lot of evil. - I think he also felt like he had an obligation to kind of preserve them in written form and without judging him, I don't think he was thinking a lot about the impact they would have in particular ways on particular people. I think they were really interesting to him as a reflection of how we manage and think about anxieties and how we address the problem of evil because there is evil in the world. My dad, I think, was really good at what he did. He had a journalist background and really cared a lot about getting the story right and about research. He was a craftsman when it came to words and this is out there, this is stuff where it's on the kinds of margins of our consciousness where we think about really important issues of who we are, what it means to be human and what it means to die and where does danger exist and how do we think about it and do with it and these are things that all kids need to think about. - And I understand that. - In fact, we don't talk about reading very much anymore and how much reading means to us. Talking about reading is difficult for people because reading is such a personalized process, but in fact, the way you see how much reading means to someone is if you're trying to take it away from them. - When he died, he had achieved a fair amount of success and was pretty well known in the little world he was part of, but there was almost no one at his, we had a graveside service and there were probably only like 15 people there, max. I mean, his family, he didn't have a community to mourn for him in the sense that I think a lot of people do. But he was able, it really was a surprise to me, but he was able to leave despite that, quite a legacy. - We were thinking of an idea that we could use and I came up with the idea like man, Scary Stories, everybody loves these like, everybody. I mean, people in my family, all of my friends, we all loved this book. I saw so much interest, so many people sharing it, so many people liking it, so many people commenting like, this is amazing, this is amazing. You still see it to this day as far as influence on musicians, you see it in movies, you see it in artists. I mean, it was a huge deal and I think it still is a huge deal. - You know, what life is all about, just the dark aspects and I don't think it's a bad thing. You grow out of it and you love it. You really appreciate it. - You should be a little scared, you know? There should be some kind of excitement between that. I mean, if everything's just handed to you and sugar coat it, how do you take on the world? That's just like, 'cause it needs to be striking. That's how we remember it to this day. - When we started doing this event and even up until recently, when I was sharing on websites and man, in minutes, the status were being shared all over the place. I've read people asking to take this exhibit to Dallas, to take it to Houston. I've seen people, why don't you take it to California? It's mind blowing. This isn't a little thing, this is huge, this is worldwide and it's amazing, it really is amazing. I can't believe it's been so long and yet people love these books, they love these stories, they love this artwork. It's just honestly, it's never gonna go away.
