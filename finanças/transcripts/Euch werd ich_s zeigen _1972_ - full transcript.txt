I WILL SHOW YOU! - What is the name of the city? - Fichtenhainigen. - I've never heard of it. - Do you think I have? - Here you go. - Come on, further away. - Master, be careful with that lamp. - We never break anything. That's our rule. - Where's our boy? - It's alright, he'll come. Bernd, where the hell have you been? We just did a lap of honor. You're coming with me in the furniture van. Bernd, I still have your book. I can send it to you. Yes, send it to me. Fichtenhainigen. Buchenweck. 147. - Bernd! - Well, goodbye! - See ya. - Have a good trip. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Write! - Will you come for the holidays? - Sure! - Bye! - Bye! Come on. You can live elsewhere, too. Indians don't know what pain is. Fichtenhainigen is a great little town. Well, well... BECK'S ICE FACTORY Beck's ice will always rescue you and never melt! - That's ice for Lehman. - We live here. But it's still Lehman ice. But they don't live here anymore. It doesn't matter. You can have it. It's all paid for. Hello. My name's Doris Kien. And I greet you on behalf of the council of the pioneer squad. I hope you have a good time in our class. The flowers will be presented to you by our teacher. Are you settling in with the Lehmans? Hello. Yes. - From Rostock? - Yeah. - Is it raining there? - No. - You probably never laugh. - On command, I don't. Could you sell your laughter? What's that nonsense? Timm Thaler sold his laughter. That's an odd name. Is he in your class? It's a character in a book. And your name's Bernd? Who do you get along better with? Your father or your mother? As in when. Depends on the situation. You get good at it over time. This is Karina. This is Karen. This is Gundula. The black one is Rolli. And in the center is Schreier. Is he in our class, too? Schreier is a Schreier. Where's Rolli? Chicken butt, you're unbearable. And this must be your new uncle? - Schreier, you're unbearable. - Schreier, you're unbearable. You gotta stay away from those sissies. Where are you from? - From Rostock, Lütten-Klein. - Lütten-Klein? Is that what you all say there? No, I'm serious, really. You better stay away from the girls in our class. They're not just stupid. They're also very sneaky. Once they know about something, you get called up to the squad council. Almost everyone there is a girl. Even a chairman is also a woman. We wanted to put a boy on the board. But our class teacher was against it. What a sissy! Well, we have too few men. Wasn't it like that with you? No. Actually, no. What? Didn't you have any arguments with the girls? - No. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Who's that? That's our classy one. She's a classy doll, right? The law of apportionment. Or... how to correctly open the brackets. Write that down for yourself. And then get your math books. Page 35, tasks 1 and 2. Read that. If you have any questions, just ask. - Bernd, have you been through this in Rostock? - Yes, we started that subject. Thank you. Is that clear, or are there any questions? Can someone help Bernd? Doris will help. I… thought you were alone here. That's right, colleague. I'm sorry. I'll bet you anything, Rolli. He's got nothing but girls in his head. - Come on. - Don't be so quick to attack him. I tested him in the pool. That's how he follows them, the girls. Here, look at this. And he seems to have Doris on the run. Hey, new kid. Hey, new kid, we got something to tell you. In case you can't remember, my name is Bernd Gaedka. When you remember, then we'll talk. You're not some kind of celebrity. We don't have to remember your last name. Even if you're from Rostock. What's up, you famous sea pirate? Okay, shut up. Rolli, don't let yourself get hurt. How do you like our school? Your school? I like it better than you do. Rolli! You don't have to tolerate it! Show him, Rolli! Stop it! Split up! Hey, Doris, is something wrong? - I think so. - Let me see. The nipple is fine. - I don't get it. - Maybe the dust is clogged. Our boys don't always act as stupid as they did today in the yard. I don't know what got into Rolli. - What's he like, anyway? - He's great, actually. What's the matter with you? Hello. - Good afternoon. - Do you always have this kind of fun? Hello, dad. This is the new boy from Rostock. And you're not doing anything again. I have homework to do. Come on. One look in a textbook and that's it. - Should we switch? - No, no. Doris, Daddy and I are going to go buy a jacket. - How'd you do in P.E.? - I'm good. Not some C's like some people? Bend over. - The department store will close. - Yeah, yeah. I'll make a man out of you. Come to my gym. Benno. So what's up? Are we going or not? Buy it yourself. You and I have the same taste. Bernd has no time. He has homework to do. - Well now he has an ally, Mr. Kretschmer. - Who? Timm Thaler, who sold his laughter to Mr. Lefuet. And now he wins every bet. Even on the streetcar. What did your dad say? - He's a Sasae tsuri-komi ashi expert. - What? Sasae tsuri-komi ashi. - What are you saying? - My father's the head instructor. He's not at home. When he comes home at night he wakes everybody up and yells: Pure victory! Ippon! What did you say? Sasae... Shuri... Kumi ashi. It's Japanese. It's such a throw. It makes amateurs cringe. And the expert is always amazed. Well, of course I have time. And you said there were lessons. You're unbearable! Tempo! Tempo! Yeah, that's right. Faster. Take your shoes off! Tempo! Tempo, guys! Don't fall asleep! You don't have to do the hitch! Yeah, that's good. Here. Take your jacket. Now, learn kumi gaiko. No, I'd rather mess with the little guy. Quickly, make pairs! Move! Move! We're on it! Let's do it! What are you doing here? That's not how you fall. - That's why it took your breath away. - Instructor Kien invited me. Let him get dressed and give me his jacket. Next we practice "shianaga" and add "kata." Who gave him the jacket anyway? I'll take the inkwell. How was school today? I'm adjusting slowly. Are you? Or just pretending? You know who was talking to me today? His teacher. We haven't lived here for two weeks and already we're talking. Bernd is new, of course she wants to meet us. And I think he wants to tell us something. Give me the cups. It's not he, but she. And a beautiful one. What? Oh, yeah. He noticed that. Do you know what kind of impression your son made at the new school? I won't let them bully me. Fighting, my boy, is not an argument. Academic performance is what matters. - How are your guns today? - They're good. Except for the fourth one. The fourth gun again? Why aren't they responding? - Look, how are you doing in school? - I don't know. So tell me, are you in the middles, among the best, or do you lag behind? Do we have any lemonade? Now that's poise. "Do we have any lemonade?" No, we don't have any! Why not? Because this gentleman is so lazy that he won't hand in his empty bottles. He thinks his parents are gonna take care of everything. Are you working again? You're a fast reader. - Interesting? Yes? - Uh-huh. It's too bad Timm doesn't have a girlfriend. Why not? She could have helped him. We'll see. Maybe she'll show up again. If he finds her, what's she supposed to be like? Like you. Just not as unbearable. The new kid is making progress. Just a little longer and he'll tame her completely. Listen, do you have a diving tower in Rostock, too? More than one. - Have you jumped yet? - Of course I have! That's great. Let's jump off ours, then. - Schreier, let's go. - What, me? Hello, ladies! They'll be jumping from ten meters. Very high, damn it. Let's get started. Attention, guys! I'm jumping! Come on! Jump! Are you jumping or not? All right. Attention, folks. I'm jumping. Now you! Yes... it's higher than I thought it would be. Are you jumping? Who doesn't have the guts, sits at the bottom. It's not an observation tower. I got scared. I turned five times before I jumped. Have patience. That's it, we're done. - That's a very slow jump you made. - I'm not in shape right now. Otherwise, it would've looked just like yours. For my first time, I didn't do too bad. Right, Rolli? It's better than not jumping at all. Admit it, you were scared. I heard your teeth chattering. I could hear your teeth chattering... Mommy! Mommy! I'll show you. I had an opponent with a yellow belt. He's got that kind of grip. I got caught. I should have thrown him over his back. To make my eyes go dark. With your technique, he'd have thrown you somewhere himself. You're new, aren't you? You're gonna have to do better than that. - Where are you from? - I'm from Rostock. No, you got to be smarter than that. Don't let your opponent get to you. I always fall for that trick. I take it like this... We'll work on that again later. Good afternoon, guys. Good afternoon. Well, how did you get here? You wanted to make something out of me. Start warming up. Let's get in the gym. And hurry up. You disappeared pretty fast last time. Well... I... I wanted to... Okay. Get undressed, and let's get on the scale. Judo pants always fit. So you want to become a judoka? Yes. It's a long way to go. It leads through the white belt... ...yellow... ...orange... ...green, blue, brown... And then finally the black belt. You have to learn a lot of throws to get one or the other belt. Win a lot of fights. What's the highest belt for high school kids? It's... blue. Second "kyu". You just don't fool yourself. You can't learn how to throw anybody in three days. Because his nose is not the way you like it. It'll be a while before you learn all this stuff. And then you won't have to prove your power anymore. That's enough. Come. No, no. It's not about fighting. Is the black belt only awarded to the master? Yes. There are ten degrees. And you have the tenth? No. As far as I know, there's no one in the world right now. The last one was Mifune. A judo master from Japan. Did you wash your feet? All right. It's okay. Go for it. Come on. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight... eight? - That's pretty good. - Can I stay here? We have to take a closer look at you first. And then we'll make a decision. Line up! Align! Practicing the movement on the mat. Left, right. Left, right. You probably think you can do everything, don't you? But you're walking on stilts. Anybody can take you down that way. What was wrong? He leaned back too much. Right. Well, Bernd. That's how you take it. Like this. Your first steps in judo. No, you can't cross your legs. And you don't have to swing your body. Every wrong move you make incites your opponent to throw. Your wife. It's a special program for Bernd. What's the matter? - I brought the jacket. - What jacket? An elegant jacket. Go ahead, try it on. You can't come to training. I haven't bought it yet. The salesgirl let me try it on. I just can't stand it. What kind of ideas... - We're fast. - ...come into your head? - Impossible. - You don't like it? Damn, Klaus! What are you doing?! You're doing great! One more! Come on! Faster, faster! Left foot up! Come on, tempo, tempo! That's it! Well done! Here. - Your application for admission. - Thank you. Let the parents sign. Just a formality, but I would like them to agree with what you are doing with me. And save the money for a judo suit. How much is it? About 28 marks. Beck's ice will always rescue you and never melt! Good afternoon, I brought the ice. We don't need it! Never mind, young Mr. Lehman. I'm not a Lehman. And anyway, we have a refrigerator. It's all paid for. - Good afternoon. - Hello. - Is Mr. Gaedka in a good mood? - Yes and no. I need to talk to my mother. Okay, I'll see to it. Just a minute, Bernd. Sister's Lotte's boy. - Sister Lotte, your boy is here. - My boy? - Something urgent? - I don't know. Mom, I have a question. It's more of a request. Good afternoon. Go to "The Gardener". You can pick up your sister later. I'm not done yet. I don't have time. - The thing is, I do sports... - Well, that's great. Hi, Bernd, are you here to see your dad? - Yeah. - Have a seat. Thank you! We're in the field right now, shooting. Is there a problem? Well then, your father is the one who can solve them. I mean, they should have been done a long time ago. - No one has come yet? - No, Comrade Lieutenant. Well, then wait here. They'll be done soon. - It's hot, yeah? - Mm-hm. - Have you been swimming yet? - No. We ought to have a little pool here now. Fire! Charge! Tempo! Tempo! 4, 3, 2, 1... Fire! Shot accurately, but the tempo is not yet sufficient. Bernd! We should summarize today. All gun commanders and spotters should come to the meeting. What are you doing here? What's up? No, nothing, I was just going to my mom's. Then I've got to go to "The Gardener" to get some vegetables. I'll get off there soon, be specific. - What's up? - Dad... I actually go to the judo lessons and I need your signature. You and I agreed that the most important thing is school. - That's the way to "The Gardener." - Bye. - Bye. - Goodbye. That was the most horrible minute. I'm here with a cart. To roll your bags. I was turning in cans and bottles. I got 3.40 marks. - See you. - Bye. - How much ice cream and lemonade did you buy? - None. I didn't buy any. No. - Anything happened at school? - No. - Is everything okay? - Yes. - What are you talking about? - It's in Japanese, you can hear me. Japanese? - I don't understand a word of it. - Japanese is the language of judo. I can put anyone on their back in a year with judo. - Even an adult. - What for? I signed up for a class. And I need your signature. I'll take it all to the instructor at once then. Oh, sonny. Ah, young Mr. Lehman, what's up? Well, did you get the job done? - The money's on the street. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - What's going on? A farmer needed ice, so I took it to him. He gave me 2 marks. It's all paid for. You can't do that. You want some? - Can't you be patient for a little bit? - Oh, come on. Look, son, I got nothing against judo. On the contrary. Just how many of these sports have you been into? No, really, judo is very important to me. Then come on, I'll show you something. Okay. Here we go. Let's have a look. Once upon a time, it was all very important to you. - It's all broken. - Yes, it's broken. And this? You couldn't live without this, uh? How long have you been collecting rocks? - I don't remember. - But I do. 2 or 3 months. No more than that. What's all this? - You don't collect stamps anymore either. - I do, but... And here...? - Broken plane. - Yeah. That's too bad. And this? - That one's the rubber came off. - Well, you can fix it. The rubber came off, so this plane isn't flying, right? And this? Table tennis. All in the past. And in Rostock, you couldn't live without soccer for a while. - I used to be a Hansa fan. - What's all this here? All in vain. - You're even worse than he is. - I want to prove something to him. - Who bought it for him? - That had nothing to do with it. It's very important and helpful to try your hand at everything. But when difficulties begin, he goes right into the bushes. Help me out here, Bernd. And how many activities have you tried? - A bricklayer... - Charlotte! - The car's here for me. - Can I go or not? You what? Don't you get it? No! I said no. Well, no. I have an opinion, too. - What does that mean? - He flew there himself. Clean it up here. Then homework. And quick to bed. I had enough for today. Me too. They have the same features, that's why they're called that. How is this species called? - It's a bird. - Right. Schreier, take the heron. Come on, my little birdie. In sixth grade, you met animals from another group. Remember what kind of animals they are. Look at the chart... PARENTS' SIGNATURE Bernd. Bernd! Please repeat my question. Are you even listening to me or not? Is that your biology notebook? You passed more in math. And in biology, you have to catch up. What's the matter? - Or maybe he's in love trouble? - Schrier, that doesn't start for us until the 8th grade. Yeah, being unstable is in our family. Yes, he gets it from his father, as his mother says. It's a common difficulty. What a boy is like when he's transitioning to a new school. But he has a great relationship with the girls. Most of the boys in my class don't get along with them very well. Have you come yet? - We agreed to do our homework together. - To me? No, to me. Come in. The teacher is visiting us. I call it "excursion day". We're going to Rostock. To Rostock? I'm going too. He does take after his father. - Does Bernd know any captains out there? - Yes, Captain Fries. And he could show us around the city. I think it would be good for the class. And for Bernd, too. The terrain becomes flat, you can look into the distance. - Do you recognize Warnemüng? - Of course I do. I have real friends there. Well, Rolli isn't a bad guy either, and neither is Schrier. - Will you show them your Warnemüng? - I'll show them all. Why didn't you tell me then that those words on that piece of paper were judo terms. I wanted to sign up for the club. But my parents are against it. - Mrs. Koelwel, come sing with us. - All right, then. Will you come with us? Oh, pardon, would you like to play cards? What are you doing here? Hello, Captain Fries! What? Homesickness? Can't live without the sea and ships? Come on board with your buddies. I'll show you how we fish. - Can the whole class come? - Yeah, sure! We're catching herring... Cod, flounder... We load it right here, freeze it. Then it goes all over the country. It comes to you. - To Fichtenhainigen? - Yes. Hey, what's that fancy doll you got there? Quiet! She's my teacher. And this is where you had the long-haired Gretta. This baby is much prettier. I'd like to meet the elegant lady, too. I always get some fat girls. Quiet! What if she hears you? Well... 60 tons of fish... Schreier! You're unbearable! Rolli, look! Don't worry. Half an hour before the train leaves, they'll be at the station. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I have to go now. Bye! Well, Bernd, goodbye, now that you're leaving. Bye! Take your time. What are you on, like, an extra vacation? You and your buddies. - Can't you do it without an assignment? - Did you say something? No. Fitte, give me the loose ends. Okay. Let's go to the big port. How much did you catch last night? 55 centners. - That's a lot, right? - Yeah. And what is produced in Fichtenhainigen? - Nothing. - It doesn't work like that. Fuel pumps for engines. It's different out here at sea. 140 horsepower. And this one has ten times that kind of power. This one is from Japan. This one is from Singapore. This is a general cargo vessel. And this one's going to Cuba. This is our smallest ship. Captain, my grandfather sailed at sea, too. I can see it in your ears. You can live here. Fichtenhainigen is a good town, too. - Bye. - Just a minute. - This is for your pretty teacher. - Thank you! Bye! - Goodbye. - Bye. The boat is gone! Hurry up! - Here, hold it! - You what? You're gonna throw yourself in the water because of this old boat? You don't understand anything! Someone was there! Wait! - There's someone out there! - Isn't there? Look! Hands off! Pirates! Pirates! Pirates! A talking parrot! He keeps repeating the same thing. Egg basket. Why, this is Columbus. Uncle Johan! How do you do? Thanks for the boat. And for you, Columbus, I'll tell you something. If you fly away again and try to go out to sea. I'll punch you so hard you'll ruffle feathers. - You can't swim. You can't swim. - What did you say? What's the matter? I could just imagine how the troop leader would look at us right now. I think the stuff is already dry. So what? I like to lie down anyway. What do we do? - I hope there's another train. - Enough of your whining. That's all I need. Too bad you can't be relied upon. But it wasn't our fault. It's the guys who didn't show up. Not the guys, the boys. Madam Koelwel, but it's not our fault. We're sorry. Madam Koelwel... Sorry for being late. We apologize. Look, don't split up. - The next train is in four hours. - We won't get home until midnight. The captain gave you the eel. It wasn't the eel's fault. Hello, Bernd! What are you doing here? We didn't do the right thing... And I also want to say... Rolli and Schreier are not to blame. I lived in Rostock. I should have known that. That's it. Is there anything else you want to say, Schreier? - Rolli? - No. The rest of you don't either? Okay. We need people to be able to rely on us. Turns out that doesn't always happen. Now, look, she's going to start defending you. And it's very strange that of the three, only one realized it. That kind of behavior is not camaraderie. Abandoning a man in distress. They just sit there and don't say anything. It's like it's all Bernd's fault. He's an example to follow. Go to hell, you and your Bernd! That's impossible. I think it's your own fault, Doris. You are too driven by personal motives. I'll certainly talk to Rolli about him leaving. That's not right. But I understand him. I don't understand anything anymore. Yeah, that's a good hand punch. But the somersault, not so good. Work it out with him. - Well, do you like it here? - Yeah. I'll catch up with you soon. Here. The suit. It's not very white. Give it to your mother to wash. Have you saved any money yet? No. I only have 15 marks. Time is running out, and we just keep standing there. I guess I'll have to give up my morning rolls. And I'm standing here for the milk. Maybe I could help you. I'd deliver buns in the morning. And milk. That's great. You would have saved time. - Do you know the address? - Yes, I do. Bye. See you tomorrow. Bye, Bernd. - Bernd? - Yeah. It's so good that you're home. What're you doing in the bathroom? Nothing. I need to go pick up Ulu. - And you go get some bread. - Okay. And maybe also... - Is there anything else to buy? - Yeah. Wait a minute. What happened? - Why? - Did you play with the water? What a pigsty in the bathtub. You're old enough. Can't I leave you alone in the apartment? I was washing. - What did you wash? - Oh, nothing. You used up all your powders. All right, I'll go get the bread myself. But we'll talk about it later. Starting tomorrow, I'll be delivering milk and buns. Gotta have ideas. Here I had a good idea about the ice. Everybody has refrigerators today. Yeah. It's just that my idea is an old one. Okay. Stop. Bye. - Hello, Bernd. - Hello. I could pass you on the balcony. That's not easy to do. I mean, we live on the second floor. Well, I'll think of something. Here's the money. - Thank you. - Oh, thank you. Hello, Bernd. I'll take that too. - Good morning, Bernd. - Good morning. One, two, three, four. Thank you. - Good morning. - Good morning. Thank you. Well, hang in there. Hold on there, big fella. Lotte! What on earth is going on here?! I told you right away the dowel was too weak. Nonsense! It's just that someone got in there. No, I'm saying the dowel didn't hold up well. Are you going to explain to a bricklayer how to hang a shelf? - And yet it fell down. - I have homework to do. Are we moving again? Timm Thaler? - Did you know I was here? - No. I just had to go to the library. We already had you yesterday. Yes. By mistake. Yummy cherries, huh? Do you like cherries? Well? Are our lovers picking up books together already? You should offer him a book called "Jumping from a 15-meter tower." Stop talking about it. Or he'll show you a judo move and you'll fly. - Judo? - Yeah, he does judo. Really? Well... Please, sir. Madam is waiting for the judo champion. Thank you. I should have been the one to tell Schreier I was practicing judo... - He's a cutthroat. - What's the big deal? No one's supposed to know about that. And all you do is talk. You're unbearable! Why the secrecy? You are disturbing our visitors. If you're going to argue, go outside. I'm not trying to be important. But believe me... That statement... Every time I go to practice, I feel bad about that statement. Why? Because my parents didn't sign it. Why don't they sign it? "Showing consistency," pretending to be educators. - But Timm Thaler... - Enough of this stupid Timm Thaler. If you'd kept your mouth shut, no one would have known. You're unbearable! You can tell your father all about it. Get away. - Two more buns today. - Thank you. Here, we'll get it all up now. Great job, Bernd, thank you! - Bye! - Bye! - Bernd, what about the money? - We'll settle up tomorrow! You're getting earlier every day! Thank you! Thank you. A judo suit? For you? This one, I think, will do. Check it out. Does it fit? Judo pants always fit. How much does it cost? 27 marks 80 pfennigs. - Is that what you were saving up for? - Yeah, but I thought the suit cost 26. Don't worry, I'll add a stamp and 80 to your milk money. Or you won't be delivering milk anymore? At first I wanted to do it until I bought a suit. But now the women are used to it and are waiting for me. You're right. Break a leg. Or how do you say in judo? I don't know. I'll have to ask. Pay close attention to your left, Bernd. Yes. Well done, Bernd. Very good. You're a sly one. All right, guys, listen to me. Everybody sit down. Listen up. Everyone. Bernd has been with us for quite some time. What do you think? Should he be on the team? Bernd is good and he fights pretty well. The technique is not enough. He'll earn a yellow belt. He's got good technique. Some techniques I don't do any better. That's settled. No more special programs. You're part of the team. - That's great, isn't it? - Yeah. Can I be excused? Go ahead. Do you always run to the bathroom when you're happy? Let's continue. Break's over. - What are you doing? - Waiting for Bernd. Come on, let's do it. Wow, it's so bright now. - You finally made some money, huh? - That was fast. - New suit! - I got a new one, too. It looks great. A new one. Super new. That's a clean, new suit. Frank, your suit's material is a little frayed, you should give it a little touch-up. - You too, Evan. - Yeah, yeah. - How much did your father put out? - Nothing! - I saved up myself. Honestly! - Holy crap, do you have a pencil or a pen at home? Yeah. Why? Get your father to finally sign the application. Is that clear? Uki Goshi with a new partner. Come here. Hey, take it easy. It's a new suit. Where is he? She was telling me what he does here. She was bragging. Maybe he was bragging to her, too. Like then, about jumping off the 10-meter. Pretty cool stuff, huh? Take your shoes off! Carry on. - There he is! - I told you! Come on, let's keep going. - Do you want to sign up? - Good afternoon. - No, no. We're just watching. - No, we want to sign up. - Come here. Bernd and I are in the same class. Well... Go ahead and do your best. Hang on. This is the man you can trust. Just you wait! That's it! That's it! Ula, Ula! Come here, they're fighting! 7, 8, 9, 10... Victory! It doesn't count. You're in a different weight class. Shouting from the audience is prohibited. And since you're the judge of this match, you've got to stretch your legs, too. I won, Mom! I won! And I won! Three against one! No wonder you won. You have such a strange grip on me. But I'm strong, right? Yes, you're very strong and you help your mom a lot. And how do you know these techniques, the grip...? Well... maybe learned it in judo? Just don't ask all those "innocuous" questions again. Can anyone be defeated by judo? Yes, you can. Knock two or three people down? Sure. If you've been practicing for a long time. And you can be beaten? You keep saying "knock you down," "beat you." And judo is a soft art. Dad, you have to master judo. Look, the fish don't bite. They're scared of your judo talk. You see, son, if we say yes to you this time... Then in five weeks, I'm sure you'll ask us to sign you up for women's soccer. You're not the only one to blame. We're partly responsible for it, too. I know how I can get a signature! Grandpa will sign for me. Did something wrong again, right? And dad mustn't know. Give me that. We, Schreiers, have always had trouble in school. You read it, Grandpa. I want to sign up for judo. Signed by the person in charge of education. - You have the right to sign, don't you? - You bet! I'm the only one... ...who's raising you. - That's it! Thank you, Grandpa! Cool grandpa, huh? Come here, my boy. Come with me, just in case. Do you know how Max Schmeling became world champion? He was a boxer. He chopped wood every day. Every day! Lots of it! - But Grandpa! I'm gonna do judo. - I know. I can hear it well. And that's why you'll be chopping wood every day. That will give you strength. You won't be a good boxer, otherwise. Grandpa, I do judo! If you have any questions, you can find me at the house. Well, so long, boxer. Mom? Dad? Rudolf Gaedka - Hello. - Hello. - Are you joining us? - No, I just dropped off an application with a signature. Um... - It didn't have one. - Didn't have what? Doris, get his application out of the mailbox. Oh, nice! Clear the table. Watch out for the signature! It's judo everywhere. It's your instructor's favorite pie. You should try it. Only my Mom knows how to make it. Is Dad coming soon? He promised. I already ate. - What's wrong with you? - Oh, nothing. Are you still mad about that one time? Ouch! Damn, it's official permission again. I'd better put it away at Timm Thaler's. Till Dad comes. Is that book about Timm Thaler? Can I read it? Sure. Did you like it after all? I forgot the spoons. Sit down. Take the book. I won't be needing it. Bye. I have an urgent matter. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Did something happen? - No. I don't understand it myself. Sometimes he acts very strange. Bernd, come here. - Did something happen? - I don't know. What's your relationship with Rolli and Schneier? We didn't get along very well at first, but we're fine now. Listen, Bernd, during self-preparation... ...keep an eye on them. Especially for Rolli. There's something about him. But don't let him brag. Got it? That's pretty good. Don't push, Bernd! Come on, be precise! - What the hell is that? - Listen up, come here, quickly. Everybody! Guys, that's bad. Very bad. You guys move like old broads. That's not judo, that's some cheap fiddling. Bernd, you can't do that! - Pay attention to your technique. - It's their family expression. - Tell me. - What? - You're looking more and more like Timm Thaler. - Why so? Because you never laugh. You got a signature. My father has high hopes for you. And you're not laughing. - Maybe you sold your laughter? - Nonsense! Pick it up! - Put it down! - Stop it! Pick it up! Hurry up! Pick it up! Put it down. He didn't do it on purpose. - And nobody's asking you! - Stop it! - This is my last warning! - Stop it! - I warned you! Keep it in mind! - Oh, I'm scared. Your school and I warn you. A student from yur class. Bernd! Rolli! The schoolyard is not a mat! You were right, but... You should write the remarks in their diary. You're out of your mind. Well, well... Schrier is going to be a teacher? Anyway, sports are having a positive effect on you two. I do judo too! But maybe not for a long time. I haven't noticed anything yet. How long do I have to wait?! - Physical education! - Hey! - I've been waiting for three minutes! - Excuse me! - It's the pants. - Last time it was the jacket. He's not getting this thing. Sit down! Everybody's on the mat. This is getting serious. I hope you're all well prepared. As for the "Kyu" exam... It's all about the technique. Think about the Pioneer Cup. All the teams are very good. I've seen them all. They're all very good teams. But we're better. We're pretty clear on most of the guys. Only about Bernd and Rolli do we need to make a decision. What is it again? I can't get a good grip. My hands hurt. My grandpa always makes me chop wood. He says it gives you strength. - Schmeling did that too. - He was a professional boxer. - I told him, but... - But it's good for keeping fit. Your grandfather's right. So we'll give it a try. Bernd, you start. Rolli does the "enuke". Close the door! We have an exam! Is Fräulein here for his exam? You what? As a guardian angel? Repeat it! Idiot, what are you stalling for? Rolli, what does that mean? You want him to fail the exam? Let's do it again. Stop it! Break it up! That's it. You can go now. You're out of your mind. What are we supposed to do now? Throwing the whole team off-balance. Next pair. Paul Bötcher and Karl Schreier. - I'll hit you again! - Come on, try it! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. - I couldn't stand her anyway. - Can Doris stitch it up? I already have a checkered belt. Shall we go apologize? Well, you're on par. That's good. Just keep it that way. You passed the exam. Congratulations on your yellow belt. - And excuse us for our behavior. - Okay. Forget it. - Got lucky, huh? - Okay, folks... There will be no practice next time. But we'll meet on Sunday. And I kindly ask you to put on some decent clothes. Is that clear? Go get changed. Dress up decently? What's that supposed to mean? - Pants or shorts? - Pants, of course! Or do you want to wear shorts under your jacket? That's what my sister does. That's the fashion right now. Does she have legs like yours? With a figure like mine, the only thing left to do is to wear a yellow belt. - Did you pass for it? - In the other training! You act like we haven't talked about this. You behave as if you and I did not talk about it. Are you there soon? Someone from my battery is about to pass by. - Charlotte! - That's right, Comrade Captain! Remain a respectable man. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Just a minute. - Mrs. Gaedka? - Yes. - Hello. - Hello. I've already tried several times to talk to your boy. Why? Did he do something wrong? No. He brings milk and buns to the house next door. Could you tell him to bring us two bottles of milk and six buns, too? - Can I help you? - No, no. Sweet girl. - How old is she? - One year and five months. Achim, are you coming? - Goodbye. - Did you hear that? - Yes. - And how do you like that? Well... Congratulations, Bernd, on your yellow belt. - Thank you. With that kind of support, I'm not surprised. - Are there any black belts? - Put it aside for you? No, no! That may not happen anytime soon. But I'd like to take a look just like that. Mifune - the world champion in all categories against Bernd Gaedka! Why make a secret out of it? It's great that you're helping women, bringing milk and buns. But I guess it's not just out of noble motives, huh? I wanted to make money. Your son doesn't have enough money either. - So I can buy something. - What is it? Well, something... "Something"... That's a good answer. Well, have you bought that "something" yet? - It was supposed to be a surprise. - Surprise? In that you succeeded. For Christmas. For Christmas. Okay, go to bed. G'night. - Hi. - Look how mommy dressed him up! When you sit down, pull up your pants. Just so everybody knows you got legs, not stilts. - Have you seen any frogs around here? - No. Why? Because you're like a stork walking through a swamp on long skinny legs. You got the legs, but you ain't got the strength. Fools. Look, here comes Trabant! This trip is a reward for your diligence in training. Here, hand these out as well. Our trainer is Kien so we're going outdoors. - Outdoors isn't quite right. - It starts with an "M". - Amusement fair? - Museum? Margarine factory? Listen to me, you've seen it all. The strongest wins here. Just like us. We've been speculating for a long time about who has the best chance. Another time might be different, but right now... Everyone else has an important assignment, too. Because it's not just on the mat that decides the outcome of a fight. Athletes need support. That's what you'll be there for. How long will we be there? Saturday going there, and back on Sunday. Two days? - Mr. Kien. - Yes? I think Rolli is better prepared than I am. - Better put him on the list. - That's out of the question. Bernd is better. - You really think so? - Yes. Everybody's afraid of the first fight. You have to go through with it. - Hello, Lotte. - Hello. - Are you staying for dinner? - No, I have to go home. No, no. Have a seat. - Is Bernd here? - They're having a pioneer meeting today. Pioneer meeting? On Thursday evening? There's certainly an explanation for all of this. I'll take the books away. Well, Lotte? We showed consistency to our boy for the first time. - What did you say? - Nothing. I told him-- After the class, he said to me: "Congratulations on your boy." - "What did he do?", I asked. - "He was put on the list." On the list? I don't understand anything. - Here. - Turns out, it's all connected. Thanks. So Bötcher's son does judo. And you know what our son has been doing all this time? Judo? Yes, of course. Judo. And the instructor is very happy with him. Says Böttcher, right? And he was put on the team for the competition. - Right, Wolfgang? - That's right. Your upbringing. One moment you act this way, the next you act that way. - And now you feel flattered. - Yes, that's true. - But what are we going to do? - Really, what are we going to do? Bernd wants to go to the competition. But he has to open up to us. I'll help him. Get yourself two men and you'll never have to go to the circus again. Rudolph, do you understand anything? Well, maybe he needs to look after his weight? - Are you cold? - Yes. No... Before that, yes, indeed, I was shivering like a calf. And now... - So maybe you need to warm up? - No, no. How about a couple of days in bed? We wanted to go to Grandma's for Saturday and Sunday. - This weekend? - Yeah. - What are your plans? - I... I guess... ...that I'm really sick. - No, there's no fever. - But I really feel weird. Yes, I understand that. Go alone to your grandmother's. No. Since you're not feeling well, we'd better all stay home. Dad... As a matter of fact, I... - What's up? - Nothing. Actually, I'm short on time and my mom's short on time. But somebody's got to go to Grandma's. Maybe you'll get over it and go to her alone. Or do you have plans with the guys? There's no way he can tell. I can barely contain myself anymore. - So what now? - What? I told him to go to his grandma's by himself. That's about it. Great! What a pedagogue! Let's open our competition with a sports greeting... - Hello! - Disperse! Quiet! - Who is this handsome gentleman? - This is my instructor. He looks just like Schmeling! In the first fight in the weight category up to 27.5 kilograms... ...meets "Karpinski", "Dynamo" and Lepricht's "Red Vortex". Look at the guys in your weight class. Hajime! Hajime! Get a better grip on him! Go! Now! Come on! Would you mind taking off your hat? Ippon! - Oh man, that Grüngott is good. - Yeah, you got to be careful. He's levering the elbow away and grabs the armpit. But you'll make it, I'm sure. Bernd! Bernd, your turn! Don't let Grüngott take you down. Come on! Hajime! Bernd! Don't step out! Grab him! Get him, Berndt! Get him! Waza-ari! Be still! Can you hear me, Bernd? - Quiet! Turn on your power! - To the left! Waza-ari! Get up, Bernd! Come on! Come on! Work, work! Get up! Yeah! Bernd! Bernd! Look out! Bernd, stay awake! Bernd! What's the matter?! So what? Nice knockout! We won! Bernd, keep your head up. I lost my first fights too. Seven fights! You fought well. But you let your attention wander for a moment. Didn't you? But the important thing is that we won! - Really? - Yeah. Our team. In half an hour, we'll fight Potsdam. - Warm up, you're going out soon. - Me? Sure. You're going to win the next fight. Good afternoon. Gaedka. Good afternoon. I'm glad we met. I wanted to come by earlier. But, you know, time is short. Bernd is all right. Except for today's fight... - But next time it'll be different. - No, no. I really enjoyed it. It's a great sport. - It's very exciting. - Dad... I... Yes, my son was certainly being arbitrary. We need to finally have a normal relationship. I'll certainly sign the application for admission. - You can take the boy with you. - Yes, thank you. Come on, Bernd, get dressed. - We have a lot to talk about. - That's for sure... Paul, get me Rolli, quick! Rolli! Rolli, you're wanted! Here. Get dressed and warm up. Goodbye. - Goodbye, Comrade Gaedka. - Goodbye. - And good luck to you. - Thank you. Come on, let's go. - Well, so this move called... - "Tomu naga". - There's nothing you can do against it? - You can, but you should flip in the air. That's great. You know, Bernd, I like that you're really into this. But why hide all of this? You're not afraid to go out on the mat. Dad, there's one more thing I have to say. I needed money for a judo suit, so I was delivering milk and buns. And the shelf I knocked over... I was working on a U-turn punch. That's what I thought. And I also... - Forged a signature. - What signature? Yours. - Dad! - What did you do?! My son is forging a signature! What am I supposed to do with you?! That was the first and last time. I promise, Dad. I'll tell my Mom all about it myself. Bernd. You got a C in math. That's not a very good. - I'll get better at it. I promise. - Yes, I know. Everybody has problems. Why didn't you come to me? - How's at home? - Disagreements. - Huh? - Sorry. But it's still a thousand times better than before. When I did everything on the sly. Was it necessary? At least you could have told me everything. I wanted to. But when you talk about it, everything seems even more ugly. You haven't gone to training all week. Why? Did my father forbid you? He hardly ever talks to me. - Just "yes" or "no." That's all. - Why? I guess he wants to see how I handle it on my own. You can always stop lying. So tomorrow, come to training. OK? - It's clear? - OK, OK. You sound like your father again. - Laugh! - I don't laugh on command. Without a command, then. Laugh! I lied once, too. Then, when I said my bike broke down. So? I let the air out myself. You think I didn't notice that? Okay, let's do it! Yes, higher! Good! Breathe right! Good afternoon. Excuse me, Mr. Kien. Allow me to study. Here's the signature. Have you told your father everything? Yes. Everything. Paul. Judo means giving yourself wholeheartedly. You have to understand this. With all your heart. So you have to be honest about everything. Why didn't you come to me then? That disappointed me the most. All right. Never mind. - Change your clothes! - Thank you! You have a lot of catching up to do. Bernd is back. - Is everything all right? - Bygones! - What's wrong with you? - I forgot everything. I'll have to work out more with you. - In the mornings. - In the mornings? I can't. I deliver buns and milk. Subtitles by jaygator
