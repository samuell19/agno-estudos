..Drive you round the bend When she runs it's like a glimpse of the divine And the thrills are guaranteed when you ride a rightful speed On the London to Brighton line On the Brighton line, on the Brighton line On the London to Brighton line And the regulars know that she likes to tease When she shudders all the others stumble to their knees On the London to Brighton line Now I can't help but start to drool as she guzzles up the fuel And the motion sends a shiver down my spine I get jealous, can't you see Cos the guards can ride for free On the London to Brighton line On the Brighton line Yes, the Brighton line The London to Brighton line And I swear to you if I could ring her bell That she’d tell you that no one else had rung it quite as well On the London to Brighton line On the Brighton line Yes, the Brighton line She's the London to Brighton line When her wheels all chatter and the engine purrs Well, you never heard a racket that compares to hers On the London to Brighton line You can keep your London to St Leonards-on-Sea Cos she got the carriage that does it for me On the London to Brighton line. – Pauline and Alan! – Pauline and Alan! - Come on Charlie, give us a speech - Speech! I don't like public speaking. I'd rather jump out of an aeroplane Go on then I've only ever spoken three times, formally, in public, in my life And each time I've been banged up by the judge straight afterwards I done me best bringing up Pauline on me own, after her mother... sorry... Doin' well Charlie I've had to be her dad and her mum after her mother... It's alright dad After her mother left me and went to live in Spain It's a disappointment that Jean can't be here in Brighton at her daughter's engagement party And a shame she can't even afford a stamp for a card neither. But I'm not going to go on about it Alan, welcome to my family I always wanted a son, and me and Jean had been trying for a couple of years before she.... But a man can't whatsaname a son, not on his own, can he. Not yet anyway I'd like to thank Alan's father, my solicitor - Ecce homo - No Latin, please I have enough difficulty understanding you when you're speaking English But, seriously, without Harry, I wouldn't be here today, I'd be behind bars Where, let's face it, by rights, I ought to be. Over to you Alan - Pauline, I give you my hand - He wants to be an actor Captive within my hand is a bird. This bird is my heart Is it a real bird? - No, it's a metaphor - Oh, lovely I offer you the whole of my life, as your husband I could do with a bit of this myself. Know what I mean? I accept your bird-heart thing, and I promise to look after it properly I got a bird in my hand an' all That's two birds now, I'm going to have to get in a box of Trill This bird is my heart, the only one I've ever had Nunc est bibendum Keep an eye on these two. They're going to try and get a room on their own Champagne! I think for Pauline and Alan we need a bucket of cold water - May I propose a toast. To love! In Latin... - Oh no - Ars amandi - No, Pauline - 'Ars amandi' is the art of love - I don't understand This is why I love her. She is pure, innocent, unsoiled by education, like a new bucket – To love! – To love! - Dolly, get the door - Book-keeper or butler? Make your mind up And if it's carol singers, tell them to piss off. It's only April - You're Charlie's solicitor then? - Harry Dangle. Dangle, Berry and Bush. My card - No win, same fee? - That's us - Charlie tells me you're brilliant - Put it this way, I got the Mau Mau off - Are you family Lloyd? - No, no An old friend. Me and Charlie go way back. Parkhurst Dad, me and Alan, we're going to go up to my room, to play some records Do I look like I just came down in the last shower? No. Mingle Man, what's going on? Last week I get this invitation to an engagement party... - Put that away - ...of Pauline Clench and Roscoe Crabbe Which was a shock because I always thought Roscoe was ginger He was ginger. He was as queer as a whisky and Babycham That was the whole point, it was going to be a marriage of convenience, wasn't it But today and it's a different groom, man Because Roscoe's dead. Pauline and this Alan wanted to get engaged, so I thought... - ...I've paid for the sausage rolls, so why waste them? - Exactly Man! They don't call you Charlie the Duck for nothing. Tight, man. Tight as... Some geezer from London. Says he's Roscoe Crabbe's minder Can't be much of a minder, Roscoe's dead - Is he a face? Does he look handy? - To be honest, he looks a bit overweight - Check him out Lloydie, see if he's tooled up - Charlie, I don't work for you no more Leave it to me, boys - More guests? - Roscoe Crabbe's minder Oh dear. There's no peace for the wicked. Nemo malus felix If all he wants is the cat, he can have it But I understand there was a knife fight and Roscoe Crabbe was mortally wounded? - No, he was killed - Good riddance The Old Bill are looking for his twin sister, Rachel, and her boyfriend - Because? - Revenge The boyfriend testified against Roscoe in court. Put him away for four years Man, it's obvious. Who is Roscoe going to get into a fight with on his first day of freedom? Rachel's boyfriend - He's clean. Shall I let him in? - Yeah - What can I do? - She's a smashing girl is Rachel Nothing like that vicious little toerag of a brother - It's the little guys who are the worst - You can say that again I think Roscoe was a bit whatsaname - you know, what's that word for someone who likes inflicting pain? - Police officer? - No - Sadist - That's Roscoe Unusual for twins to have such different personalities They was identical twins, you see, Roscoe and Rachel They were not identical twins. Roscoe was a boy, and Rachel is a girl - So? - Identical means identical What I want to know is, if Roscoe's dead, what's his minder doing on my doorstep? - Who's that? - It's the Queen What a beautiful woman. Someone should write a song about her This is my engagement party Your engagement party? Phew, cos I'm glad it isn't yours... - ...Beautiful eyes - Thank you Don't ever wear glasses. Even if you need to, you know, for reading I know exactly what he's after, and if carries on like this he's going to get it - What about glasses for driving? - Are you one of them women's libbers? - Would that be a problem? - No, I like a woman who can drive That way I can go out, have a skinful, and get home without killing anyone - Are you married to...? - I'm single, I'm the book-keeper here So you're a single, working, driving, book-keeping woman? Cor! That's my type. Do want to go to Majorca for a couple of weeks? Think about it I got it I like this geezer. But he can't tell his arse from a Bank Holiday Cheddar cheese and pineapple on a stick. Who first thought of that, eh? I'll tell you. A genius. Probably Scottish Alright man? Do you like blues music? Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, Leadbelly? - No - That's a shame. What music do you like? - Calypso - Oh dear. I cannot stand Calypso Still, no hard feelings. I want you to know, I'm on your side in the struggle Despite your disappointing taste in music This man is a clown Everybody at the circus loves the clowns So, when you say 'this man is a clown', what you're actually saying is 'I love you' - Are you Charlie the Duck? - No Oh shit, have I got the wrong house? The invitation... I'm Charlie the Duck - You don't look like a duck - Who are you? Good idea. Let's do the big questions. Who am I? Why am I here? What do you want? Is there a God? Is he loving or judgmental? Let's hope he's loving, cos if he's judgmental, we're all in the shit - You're Roscoe Crabbe's minder - Yes I am And I've got an invitation to his engagement party. This party Roscoe's dead If Roscoe's dead, who's that sat outside in the motor, listening to the shipping forecast? - Oh my God, no - He's risen from the dead has he? Yeah. It only took him two days. That's one day quicker than the previous world record So? Can he come in? To his own engagement party? - I guess - Good, I'll go and get him Dad, no. Don't let him in! I love Alan, I don't love Roscoe, I never did - You was perfectly happy with Roscoe six month back - He's missed the boat Roscoe Crabbe can be as late as he likes. And we have an arrangement An arranged marriage worthy of a Molière farce, contemptible even in the seventeenth century Yeah dad, this is the nineteenth century now Yeah, well, what do you offer my daughter, Alan? 'I want to be an actor'. You can't get more flaky All I offer is love. My love for your daughter eclipses poetry. My love is ethereal, pure... ...like the kind of water you're supposed to put in a car battery I'm glad you like her Long time no see, Charlie Yeah. You look well Roscoe... all things considered This is Lloyd, good friend of mine. Dolly, my book-keeper My solicitor, Harry Dangle. He's good - Are you the guy who got the Mau Mau off? - It wasn't easy - And 'course, you remember Pauline - You look fantastic Pauline Who are you? Whole nations will be slain before you take my love from me - Why's he talking like an actor? - He wants to be an actor - Oh alright. Who are you then? - I am your Nemesis Francis! What's a Nemesis? Don't know, guv. Definitely foreign. I think it might be a Citroën - What's going on Charlie? - We thought you was dead If you thought I was dead, why would you go ahead with my engagement party? - You know, I'd already paid for the sausage rolls and... - If you thought I was dead? The word was, you were murdered. Pauline's met someone else - Horror bollocks, over there? - Yeah - So, let's have another go. What's your name? - Alan I have a prior arrangement with Charlie and Pauline, Alan. It's not love, no, it can't be love This is good news for you, Alan, because the deal guarantees Pauline... ...complete freedom in affairs of the heart, as long as she is discreet My love for Pauline is not discreet; it shouts from the rooftops 'Look at me, look at me, I am love!' It shall be my son who marries Pauline. Come on Alan, we're going - Don't leave me here Alan - Mr Charles Clench, you will be hearing from me - I can explain - HARRY: Post hoc, ergo hic haec hoc I shall return. Like a storm. And everybody will get wet Pauline. Over here. Behave It's 1963, Dad. You can't force me to marry a dead homosexual - He's not dead is he? - He is a homosexual though – We've only got his word for that – Come back here... Give me a minute Roscoe LLOYD: Hey... Lloyd Boateng. My sister worked the bar for you at The Palm Tree Rachel, yeah. What's she doing? She runs this nightclub now. It's her boyfriend's. The Stiletto, Mile End I've heard it's rough. Criminals, gangsters, Princess Margaret - Yeah. It's our crowd - It's not my crowd man - You haven't always been straight, Lloydie - I am now Rachel met him at York Hall. He was on the card He won by a second round knockout. He'd boxed at public school, apparently - He's got a bit of steel then? - He's not spineless. Every living thing needs a spine - Except invertebrates - Yeah, obviously - I like your sister. She's a great girl - And she likes you a lot. She said you could be trusted The kid's upset. She thought you was dead. Do you want a sandwich? Yes! Yes please. We had to skip breakfast, you see We're going to eat later. What's your understanding of the deal Charlie? I settle the debt I owed your father, paid to you on the day of your engagement Six thousand two hundred today Pauline, as your public wife, gets two grand a year for attending functions on your arm - And she gets the house in Debden - And Debden Have you got the money, Charlie? - I can give you a cheque. Six thousand two hundred - Banker's draft. And I'll take the two hundred in cash Dolly, phone the bank, get them to knock up a banker's draft for six grand - For six thousand? - That's what I said, yeah - Are you boys staying in Brighton? - Can you recommend somewhere? - I certainly can. The Cricketers' Arms - Do they do sandwiches? Wash your mouth out. It's a pub that does food Lloyd is the landlord. He's had a three year training as a chef Parkhurst That might be the most beautiful sentence in the English language. 'A pub that does food' - Go ahead in the motor. Where is this pub? - ...that does food Go down Clifton Hill, past the British Legion, right opposite the Methodist Chapel... Left at the Salvation Army opposite the Church of the Seventh Day Adventists... Go past the Jehovah's Witnesses, completely ignore them, and next door is the St. John's Ambulance We're round the back of there - You got that Francis? - Guv, for a pub that does food, there'll be a star in the sky I've got the bank on the phone I don't know why they want to talk to me. What's the problem? - Rachel? - You're looking pretty good Lloydie Girl? What is all this with the rude boy disguise? - The Old Bill are looking for me. Can I trust you? - You're like a daughter to me Roscoe is dead. My boyfriend killed my twin brother, yeah I should hate Stanley for that. But I love him. Have you ever been in love, Lloyd? True love? Yes, once. Parkhurst I'm going to go raise that two hundred folding Make yourself at home Roscoe. You know, you're family now - I have a problem, Lloyd. You - Me? No way, man Me and Stanley are going to have to go and live in Australia Australia! No Man. Oh my God, no. that's really terrible Australia... you poor thing, girl Why Australia? Do you like opera? Not especially. But we've no choice. We sail from Southampton on Monday. The morning tide - The police will be watching the ports, so... - Brighton's near enough but safer? And Charlie the Duck lives here, and we need money I guess. You said I am a problem. Why's that, girl? I'm going to rip Charlie off, and Charlie's your friend No, man. Charlie is as bent as a snake in a bottle I'm only here today cos I'm hoping to do the food for the wedding reception You're safe with me. Where is your Stanley now? Brighton, somewhere. I've left a letter for him at the Post Office with instructions for a rendezvous I pray to God he's alright Sweet Susie at the seaside Waiting for her beau Gets a little itchy In case he doesn't show See, he has got a history of leaving her high and dry Still her ticker skips a beat with every passer-by Don't let him take you for a fool, Susie He's playing hard at playing cool, Susie You teach him not to treat you cruel, Susie Oh, sweet Susie, who does he think he is? Well, several ice creams later And still he hasn't shown Everywhere there's couples She's the only girl alone A pensioner approaches, daundering down the pier Recognises Susie and bellows in her ear Don't let him take you for a ride, Susie Why ain't you got no sense of pride, Susie? You stitch him up and blow him wide, Susie Sweet Susie, who does he think he is? A long time after nightfall Down there on the shore There's a single figure feeling sad and raw Could it be sweet Susie, waiting for him still? Nah, she's elsewhere partying with Tom and Dick and Bill You let him wonder where you are, Susie Keep dancing on that fancy bar Susie Where were you hiding that cigar, Susie? Oh, sweet Susie, you see what you've done? You've played him at his own sweet game and won. My father, Tommy Henshall, God rest his soul, he would have been proud of me, what I done with my life... ...until today I used to play washboard in a skiffle band But they went to see the Beatles on Tuesday night, and sacked me Wednesday morning Ironic really, because I actually started the Beatles Yeah. I went to see them in Hamburg. Rubbish I said to that John Lennon, I said 'John, this is embarrassing' 'You're going nowhere mate. Have you thought about writing your own songs?' So I'm skint, I'm busking, I've got me guitar, mouth organ on a rack, bass drum tied to me right foot And the definition of mental illness: cymbals between the knees There I am, middle of Victoria Station, I've only been playing ten minutes This lairy bloke comes up to me, he says 'Do you do requests?' I say 'yes', he says 'I'd like you to play a song for my mother' I said 'Of course, where is she?' He said 'Tasmania' So I nutted him This little bloke Roscoe Crabbe seen all this, comes up, offers me a week's work in Brighton Says he needs a bit of muscle. I tell him, I say this is all fat But I haven't eaten since last night and I need a wage And what's my first job in the criminal underworld? Walk into Charlie the Duck's place in Brighton and put the fear of God into him. Cor! That was a bit of a test for my arsehole. But it's all acting, isn't it It's all 'What's that, mate? What you say? You what? Come again?' 'You want some, do you? Come on then' Come on then, come on then! I can do that, I'm a geezer But I can't stop thinking about chips I'm staying in a pub, I haven't even got enough shrapnel for a pint There might be a discarded bag of chips in here No, come on Francis, you can't go looking through the bins Concentrate. I must stop thinking about chips I need to think about something boring, like... ...like Canada That's as far as I'm going with this mate. The fare is five and six - Oh f... Foot and Mouth! Don't be a bad egg about it - I drive a taxi mate, I'm not Heracles It's a trunk. No-one's asking you to hold up the sky for all eternity Atlas held up the sky. Heracles took over for five minutes... ...so Atlas could go and get the golden apples from the Hesperides' garden Taxi drivers eh... such bloody know-it-alls Alright mate? - What's this pub like? - Ground breaking. It does food A pub? That does food? Buzz-wam, whoever thought of that? Wrap his nuts in bacon and send him to the nurse - What are the rooms like? - World class Not that I care. I'm boarding school trained. I'm happy if I've got a bed, a chair, and no-one pissing on my face Could you do me a favour and keep a fag's eye on the trunk whilst I see if they have any vacancies? - How much? - Half a crown? Haddock and chips and mushy peas! Yeah, alright Don't even think about it Oi! Come here! Oi! Oi! Come here! FRANCIS: Get away from that trunk Come here! I need what they call in the Guards a batman. What's a decent drink for a geezer like you, for a day's graft? My current guvnor... that is my previous guvnor, used to pay me twenty pounds a week... ...at the end of the week, which is no use to me - Why not? - Because I have to eat every day Well, I shall pay you five pounds per day But for today that remuneration would incorporate the trunk guarding retrospectively Bloody toffs eh? Why do we let them get away with it? Alright mate, you're on Do you know where the main Post Office is in Brighton? I have absolutely no idea Oh yeah, it's next door to my Nan's. My uncle Terry lost a leg in there once There should be some post for me. You'll need this letter of authorisation To whom it may concern, the bearer is an authorised agent of Stanley Stubbers - Shhh - Who's Stanley Stubbers? Me. But don't call me Stanley Stubbers. I'm going to have to make up a new name for the pub What's wrong with 'The Cricketers Arms'? You're not exactly a Swiss watch are you? A false name for me, because I am lying low What do I call you? I don't do first names. First names are for girls and Italians Henshall? I like it A bit rural, it's got bits of livestock under its fingernails Get my trunk indoors, Henshall, collect my letters, Henshall. I'll be in my room Hup-ah! Hup-ah! Hup-ah! Hup-ah! Hup-ah! Hup-ah! Hup-ah! Hup-ah! Hup-ah! Hup-ah! Hup-ah! Hup-ah! Hup-ah! Hup-ah! Hup-ah! Hup-ah! Hup-ah! Hup... Hup... Hup... Hup...hup...hup..hup...hup...hup... Duh! I think I'm going to need a hand with this Will you two come and help me with this trunk? That's it. You and you, fella, up you come. - – There we go. - – You come and stand round this side. - You stand here. What's your name, sir? - Jez. Jez. I am Francis. Nice to meet you. And your name, sir? - Coryn. - Coryn, I'm Francis. Coryn, you've not dressed for the '60s. You're alright. Listen, before we go any further, have either of you two got your Equity cards? Don't worry, nor have I. As I'm the only person who's elected to wear a tie, I will take a management position on this. OK? So I want you to turn this way to face the pub. Coryn, you turn this way to face this door. We're gonna do this kinetically, alright, guys? We want no back injuries up here tonight. We are bending from the knees, OK? So, when I say so, we will lower... No, when I say so! A touch premature there. Oh, is he? Stop, no! I didn't... Come on! I didn't mean... How was I meant to know? It happens to the best of us, doesn't it, Coryn? Right, now... So, when I say so, we will lower ourselves down, take hold of the straps with both hands and on three, we will pick up the trunk, OK? So, down we go. Lower ourselves down. Take hold of the straps with both hands. Ready? And on three... You ready? One, two, three, go! Come on, Coryn, put your back into it! Come on! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I told you it was heavy, didn't I? I tell you what, Coryn, you might be better if you face this way. So you face this way, and down we go. One, two, three and up. And into the pub. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Thank you. You're a good man. Right. Post office Francis! Where are you going? I'm walking round and round in circles to ward off the hunger pangs - I will cook you the lunch of a lifetime - Lunch? I haven't had breakfast yet - Have you got my trunk out of the car yet? - I've just done the trunk Ah... concentrate, Francis. You're right Roscoe, I'll get your trunk out the motor now I'll get one of the bar staff to give you a hand What? You two again? Come on, out of the pub. Out of my pub. Stay there. I've told you two before, this is not that kind of pub! You're barred Go on, out! You know guv, you're a funny kind of bloke You're only away for a week and you've enough packing for a year. You know, like a woman - You think women pack more than they need do you? - Yeah. And we men let them get away with it Why do we men let them get away with it? cos if you said anything, you wouldn't get your leg over, would you Are you seriously suggesting that we men are, day to day, moment to moment... ...making thousands of small tactical decisions... ...the cumulative effect of which is to reduce the time between leg overs? That's a fair description of my life I need you to go to the Post Office and... Alright guv, stop going on about it. You only have to tell me once I haven't asked you to go to the Post Office at all, yet - Lloyd tells me it's just around the corner - That's handy Collect any letters for me or my sister, Rachel Crabbe. This is a letter of authorisation - I've got one of those. I don't need two do I? - How come you already have a letter of authorisation? This is trickier than I thought. You're right. I am going to need that - And any letters you collect are private. Is that clear? - Don't you worry guv, I won't even read them myself I'll be in my room Cor! I've got two jobs, how did that happen? You got to concentrate haven't you, with two jobs I can do it, as long as I don't get confused. But I do get confused easily I don't get confused that easily. Yes I do. I'm my own worst enemy Stop being negative. I'm not being negative. I'm being realistic I'll screw it up. I always do. Who screws it up? You You're the role model for village idiots everywhere. Me? You're nothing without me. You're the cock up Don't you call me a cock up, you cock up You slapped me? Yes, I did. And I'm glad I did because... That hurt. Good. 'Cos you started it Come here, you! Get your hands off me! No, no, no! You wouldn't dare! Wouldn't I? What is my life? Am I to eat, drink, sleep, get a good job, marry, honeymoon, have kids... ...watch them grow up and have kids of their own, divorce, meet someone else, grow old... ...and die happy in my sleep like every other inhabitant of Brighton and Hove? What kind of a life is that? No. I am an artist. Character is action I cannot allow this late suitor... That's a pun, that's quite good, maybe I could be a writer I cannot allow this twice late suitor, who is both dead and late... ...to come along and end my beautiful dream, like a dead, discarded Russian astronaut dog landing on my head My rival's lackey. This will be the beginning of the end - Where is the dog your guvnor? He will die today - Do yourself a favour mate, walk away You have obviously never been in love Janice Carter, one. Pamela Costello, two Her gran, three... Bring the cur out here, now - You want to speak to my guvnor? - Speak a little, yes, and then slaughter a lot Alright, wait here, I'll go and get him - Have you been to the Post Office yet? - I was just on my way - Who's he? - He wants a word with my guvnor - I'm your guvnor - Yes. You are, aren't you He wants to speak to me, does he? My ire is like a forest fire. Fierce, inexorable, enough to ruin several picnics - This gentleman is called Alan - Oh bad luck I'll be at the Post Office - Are you an actor? - Does it show? The way you stand, at an angle. As if there's an audience over there My rival in love, Roscoe Crabbe, arrived from London today and is staying here Bizarre. Roscoe Crabbe is the name of the chap I killed accidentally last Saturday evening... ...stabbing him three times in the chest with a knife I'd bought earlier He has today claimed my bride, my love, my life No. Roscoe Crabbe is dead. I know he's dead because... Because a friend of mine knows someone, whose dad works with a chap who says he murdered him I met him not an hour ago. He lives, his every breath tortures me I suppose when I fled the club he wasn't actually yet dead Oh Jeez! If Roscoe did survive and is in Brighton, he's here for one reason only, to kill me. Oh my God No. He's not staying here. I know him. I would have seen him Oh. I was led to believe... No matter. My card If you see him tell him that his life will only be spared if he gives up his wedding plans You said your name was Alan? This card says Orlando Dangle - Equity already had an Orlando Dangle. - So you chose 'Alan'? It's 1963, there's a bloody revolution in the theatre and angry young men are writing plays about Alans - What's your name, sir? - My name? Buggerello! Going to have to be creative now. Not my best game Dustbin... Dustin Dustin Pubsign - Pubsign? - Pubsign. It's an old Anglo-Saxon guild name The bakers baked the bread, the Smiths were the blacksmiths, the Pubsigns... we made the pub signs It has been a pleasure to meet you, Mr Pubsign Roscoe's in Brighton! I'd be better off lying low in London than lying low in Brighton Poor dear Rachel must be terrified. Oh God, can this be happening? What to do? I must go to London, find Rachel. Damn it, I can't. I have to wait here for Rachel's letter Oh, God, it's a rozzer! Lovely day for it - Lovely day for what sir? - Fighting crime Authorisation letter. That can go in this pocket. Rachel Crabbe. Let's put that in this pocket for now I'm good at this. I could work for the Post Office. That'd be three jobs Another authorisation. That goes in the authorisations pocket. What's this...? Stanley Stubbers Don't really need these authorisation letters any more do I? So this pocket is now for Stanley Stubbers' letters. Roscoe's sister, Rachel Crabbe... What are these then? I'm getting confused now. If there's two letters they definitely need their own pocket What's this? Stanley Stubbers. That's the one that tasted nice Yes. Not bad for paper. Bit dry. Could do with a bit more ink I didn't know paper could taste this good. I might go back to communion - Henshall, did you get the letters? - Yes, all here guv How many? Just the one I guess Let's have a look. We've got... - There's nothing here for you guv - What are those letters then? - These are... decoy letters - Decoy letters? The Post Office release them like homing pigeons See how many return, how many get shot down and run over The truth Henshall. Or you'll never bugger the dolphin again - These are Paddy's letters - Paddy? He's a friend of mine who was picking up letters for his boss, but he hadn't had any lunch yet So I said I'd pick them up so he could have haddock and chips and mushy peas This letter is for my intended, Rachel Crabbe - You can't open other people's letters - Why not? It's a very deep basic human thing that doesn't need explaining At boarding school we opened each other's letters all the time You also gang raped eleven year old boys. Which is not normal either - No? - No It felt pretty good at the time This letter is from Jackie, Rachel's best friend Dear Rachel, The police know you fled to Brighton dressed as a man So The Evening News carried an artist's impression of what you might look like in men's clothes You ended up looking a bit like Ringo Starr, who's already been arrested twice Rachel, the woman I love, is in Brighton dressed as the percussionist of a popular beat combo They also carried a boxing photo of Stanley... That's me It's so awful that you have to go to Australia. Love, Jackie. Three kisses Three kisses? That's a bit girls-only-Greek-island - Henshall, have you met Paddy's boss? - No Find Paddy, tell him to tell his employer I'm staying here - I'll look for Paddy after lunch - No, now. This is a matter of life or death Has anybody got a sandwich? Seriously. Anyone...? Oh, come on! There must be a thousand people in here No-one's got a York ham and mustard? Bacon, lettuce, tomato? Cheese? Of all the nights! Just... to be clear... You have a sandwich on you now? Which clearly you do! And you are... prepared to give that sandwich to me? 'If you like?' Oh, what a guy, ladies and gentlemen! What kind of sandwich is it? - Hummus. - Hummus?! No wonder you haven't eaten it! I don't really know what to do now! I mean... I can say I'm hungry. I did ask for it, so... So you might as well hand it over! I got a minute, if you want a hand with that trunk of yours OK, although... remarkably, this gentleman has a sandwich. We...we should go and get the trunk from the car... I will decline your offer, sir. But thank you very much. You'll learn in the not too distant future you have somewhat messed with the play. - Francis! Have you got the letters? - There you go guv None of yours have been eaten. I'm going to get your trunk out the motor now Francis. This letter has been opened I'm going to have to come up with a very convincing excuse here I had to open it because I realised that there was a small, distressed frog trapped inside How did you know there was a small distressed frog trapped inside a sealed envelope? There was no frog, actually I also had a letter for me, which I hadn't yet opened, and I opened yours by mistake Get my trunk to my room, then come back here. We need to talk It's from a friend of mine. Jackie. I like Jackie, but she's a bit, you know... needy Ringo Starr? Which one's Ringo? Is that the drummer? The ugly one with the huge...? Oh, bloody hell Love, Jackie. Three kisses. What's she after? Basically, it's a condition of the spine. They call it ankylosing spondylitis If I try and lift anything heavier than a knife and fork I go blind Very convenient - It's a Viking condition and I'm one third Viking - And two thirds idiot - Are you stupid? - No I could've gone to university if I'd got the qualifications - What's your ironing like? - World class I've got the equivalent of a 2-1 in ironing from Durham I need a clean shirt. Ironed. My shirts are in the trunk. Here's the key Has Charlie the Duck been here with the money? - No - I better go chase him up He didn't say the shirts needed ironing urgently, did he? Maybe I could down the High Street and beg for some food Is your guvnor in? I've got his bangers here - Sausages? - Bangers and mash Sausage and mash in an envelope? I've just seen the future No gravy obviously, that'd be stupid - It's cockney rhyming. Bangers and mash - Cash - So it's not food then? It's the two hundred folding for your guvnor. Don't let me down When am I going to eat? - Henshall. Did you find Paddy? - I've arranged to meet him later, on the pier - What's that? - It's an envelope full of money for my guvnor - I'm your guvnor - Yes you are, aren't you Go on, take it. I don't care any more Must be that pawnbroker down the road. Did he have a wig, a hearing aid, and a glass eye? - For sale? - No, as functioning parts of his anatomy - He was wearing a hat - Must be him I gave him a pocket watch earlier. The one George V gave my grandfather for planning the Amritsar massacre I like Brighton. Cash delivered, pubs with food, it's a better kind of England I'm going to go in and get on with your ironing - Initiative. I like it - I thought we'd already agreed I'd iron your shirts No, but have a go. I never understood how irons work I used to bunk off physics, spent every lesson in the radiation cupboard trying to make my penis glow Onward! Little fella with a body like a seal One leg is wooden and his mouth is full of steel But I seen him at the boxing and I had to reassess He's with this blonde bombshell, she's spilling out her dress It makes you wonder how he got himself that missus Six-foot stunner and she's on him like a rash Every week when she smothers him with kisses He bungs her an envelope stuffed full of cash Dodgy politician with a smug little face Brings about a scandal that leaves him in disgrace Every day the papers run another slur Goes to see the Queen and now we have to call him sir Makes you wonder how he got himself a knighthood Half an hour earlier he was lying in the trash A bloke who knows says he was sighted Bunging her an envelope stuffed full of cash Thank you very much! Makes you wonder how the taxman gets a look-in Dodgy deals and books that need a-cooking And dirty brown envelopes stuffed full of cash. I can't marry that tiny, weird looking, vicious, homosexual, short arsed, runt of a criminal Why not, what you got against him? I want to marry for love Trust me. You don't want to marry for love. When your mother... when she left me, I... Don't upset yourself dad. What you trying to say? I'm trying to say that love passes through marriage quicker than shit through a small dog But I love Alan Marry Roscoe and you get a detached house in Debden. In the forest. A mile long drive - From where? - From the nearest public thoroughfare A swimming pool, a tennis court, and a horse. And he won't ever touch you You just got to go to the boxing on his arm, show the world he isn't a nine bob note And at two grand a year he's paying you more than Bobby Moore is getting I didn't know he was living with Bobby Moore They've tried, but they can't make bricks thicker - Five years ago, you agreed to this agreement - Five years ago I was young and stupid - So what's changed? - I'm a lot older now Roscoe's back My future son-in-law is outside? Let him in then. Make him a cup of tea. Get the bunting out Let's hope for your sake that he's not come back here to rearrange my face Hello Roscoe. Come in son. Did you get your bangers? I did not get my bangers, no. And I didn't get no banker's draft neither. That's why I'm here I give the bangers to that geezer of yours. The two hundred Alright. And the six thousand? Let's have lunch, at The Cricketers. I'll have it all signed off by then What's she singing about? This is her grieving for your death from three days ago. She's always a bit behind - I'd like a word with her, if that's alright. Alone - Alright Roscoe. Take your time - Pauline... - Piss off! I hate you. You've ruined my life - I know what would make you feel better - You bleeding well touch me, and I'll scream - I have a secret - I don't want to know anything about your life I wish you were dead I can't bear to see her suffer any longer I am dead Are you? No, really? What's it like? - Roscoe, my brother, is dead - You're Roscoe's brother? - Sister - I don't understand - I'm Rachel, Roscoe's twin sister - Oh yeah! They said he was one of two identical twins - It is not possible for identical twins to be different genders - Why not? - Because one would be male and the other female - I don't understand All you need to know is that I am a woman - So, hang on, that means, I can't marry you, doesn't it - More importantly it means you can marry Alan - Can I? - In the near future - I'd better go tell him - No. My identity must remain a secret. I need your help I'll do anything to marry Alan. I love him - I too am in love - Really? With Alan? No. His name's Stanley It's weird isn't it. Love. I want to talk about him all the time That's very true. I try to turn every conversation around to Stanley So do I. To Alan Stanley's a very manly name. Alan's kind of heroic. Alan Stanley killed my own brother, and yet I love him - Love. It's like being mad, isn't it - Insane Look at me. Dressed in my dead brother's clothes - Maybe this is your way of grieving for him - Yes. I hadn't thought of that We girls have to help each other Sorry, should have knocked. Well, well I never I'll come back in half an hour. Put a record on - Charlie, you can go ahead with plans for our wedding - Right But I need time... to choose a dress - And the banker's draft is... - Roscoe, trust me, the money's no problem I'd better go tell Laurence Olivier it's definitely off. Harry Dangle won't like this Oh bloody heck. What if dad tells Alan? Alan might think we've had it off - What would Alan do, if he were to think that? - He'd go into one. He's known as a dangerous actor - I can look after myself - I know, but still, I'd better get to him before dad does - You swore to keep my secret - How long do I have to go along with this lie? Me and Stanley are going to have to live in Australia Oh no! Australia? Oh no. Oh my God. Australia? How awful It'll be a terrible outdoorsy life, sustained by lager, barbecues, and opera I sympathise with you. But my Alan, he's suffering right now Trust me. My plan will deliver to you the husband of your choice - Alan? - Yes, Alan And the pain you feel now will be forgotten in a couple of weeks' time - The night always seems darkest just before dawn - What? That bit of the night, you know, just before dawn always seems really dark Although it isn't, it's just the contrast with the light of morning I don't understand Now my old man had an appetite, he could really pack it in Cos no one bothered to tell him gluttony was a sin He could polish off a whole roast pig from the trotters to the snout And that was just for starters, cos then you'd hear him shout Gimme one, gimme two, gimme three dinners Gimme three dinners or four Gimme five, gimme six, gimme seven dinners And I'll still have room for more Gimme eight, gimme nine, gimme ten And if my belly starts to hurt Then I'll say when and stop at ten and then move on to dessert Now my old man was a lovely soul But he weren't to everyone's taste He found it hard to find a girl With his 98-inch waist But then one day he met his match Imelda from up west She claimed she'd out-eat any man So they put it to the test Gimme one, gimme two, gimme three dinners Gimme three dinners or four Gimme five, gimme six, gimme seven dinners And I'll still have room for more Gimme eight, gimme nine, gimme ten and if I have to stop I will The one who eats the least can start by picking up the bill Ladies and gentlemen! Now if your old man's a gannet you'll know it ain't much fun When he tips the scales To the tune of half a ton. Roscoe has insisted on having lunch with Charlie up here in private, instead of downstairs in the bar Don't ask me why he wants to eat in private, I'm not paid to think Mr Stubbers is having a lie-down, which I guess you have to do a lot of when you're lying low I've been nil by mouth for sixteen hours I'm only alive because me gall bladder's worked out a way of eating me kidneys But the good news is, it's lunch time. There's going to be food everywhere All I've got to do is organise a stash, you know, leftovers, the odd whole course going missing Hide it under here maybe Oh look at that... a mouse trap With a lump of Cheshire cheese. My favourite, all white and crumbly This bit's only slightly nibbled STUBBERS: Henshall! How come a mouse trap went off on your tongue? - It's a personal thing guv - Understand. I too enjoy pain - Did you find your friend Paddy? - I've arranged to meet him after lunch I've no time to waste on lunch, I'm going down to the pier to look for him myself Actually this suits me. Get this guvnor out the way while I serve the other one - By the way, what does Paddy look like? - He's a big feller, smells of horses Smells of horses? Or smells like a horse? The former is respectable and an indication of family money, the latter is just poor hygiene - At the end of the day, it's the same thing isn't it - Good point Now take your time guv. There's two piers, I can't remember which pier he said now - Do you want me to order you some food for later? - Order what you like When I do dine I need to eat in private, waited on by you and you alone What's this Bradman room like? Perfect. I'll eat in there I don't want to take all this cash with me. Can I trust you with it, Henshall? - Is it edible? - I doubt it - It's safe with me then guv - I'll slip out the back My name's Gareth. I'm the head waiter. This is Alfie - I'm eighty-six - No you're not. You're eighty-seven - I thought I was eighty-six - No. That was last year Be patient with Alfie please, he's a bit deaf, so don't turn your back, he's going to lip read I'm never going back there. It was a bloody massacre He was at Gallipoli. He has balance problems, he suffers from the tremors And he's got one of them new fangled pacemakers for his heart Is that all I need to know? - One other thing - What's that? It's his first day I've been told to set places for Mr Clench and your guvnor In there, the Compton room. My other guvnor will eat alone in the Bradman room later And they've both insisted that I personally wait on their tables You've got two employers? Yeah. I'm that good. I was trained by the legendary French waiter, Jean Jacques Jim - In France? - Of course - Which town? - Ashby de la Zouch - That's near Loughborough - It is now - Do these guvnors of yours know you've got two jobs? - No, that is our secret for today - What's in it for me and Alfie? - It's less work for you and you still get paid - What about our tips? - You'll get ten bob from me at the end of the afternoon Deal. Alfie, set one place in the Bradman room. I'll get some wine lists How many courses do you think Roscoe and Charlie will want? - Seven - Seven. À la carte? No, they're going to eat indoors. I'll order for them The menu is in French How many languages do you speak? I speak two languages actually. English and French. The menu, por favor - Por favor is Spanish - Bloody hell. I can speak three languages - Alfie - He's in the Bradman What's he doing in there? Apparently the gentleman from room ten wants to eat in private in there later Oh. He'll need a menu then Alfie... Jesus! Put this menu and wine list on the table Table! - Are you ready to order then? - Yes Can we have a lot of hot food, and, you know, just keep it coming My pleasure So, Gareth, Alfie. Bring the food here, to this table, and I will serve it Alright. Alfie, bring the soup to here - Do you get two salaries then? - Why else would I do it mate? - What about holidays? - Two weeks from each employer, that's five weeks in all - You're not stupid are you? - Not even a little bit You know what bankers are like. They'll only lend you an umbrella if the sun's shining - You haven't got the money have you Charlie? - Of course I got the money, but... - But what? You haven't printed it off yet? - I'm out of that game. I sold the ink Roscoe, this is my problem, I'll have its arse slapped by three o'clock. And, I'm paying for lunch, I insist Francis, Charlie said he gave you some cash earlier. In an envelope Oh no. I can see what's going to happen. Roscoe's going take Mr Stubbers' money. That's a disaster No, wait, it is Roscoe's money. Yes Here you go, guv. I've set two places in here, the Dennis Compton Room I can't have nothing to do with Dennis Compton. He was a Gooner Dennis Compton played cricket for Arsenal? Football. In the winter. I'm Spurs aren't I. I can't eat in there, someone might see me Let's eat in that room there, the Bradman - No - Why not? The gentleman from room ten has already booked this room He's not here is he. When room ten arrives, he can have the Compton - You got anything against the Aussies Charlie? - No. As it happens, I quite like opera And, obviously they're not Arsenal, so they're not scum Oh, shit! - Come on Alfie you can do it - This soup must be made of lead, it's bloody heavy Let me help you with that - Henshall - Guv? You're back, that was quick Yes, well I went round to the Palace Pier, couldn't find anyone who smelt like a horse And the other pier was on fire, so I thought I'd best give it a miss Truth is, Brighton is swarming with rozzers - I want to eat now - Now? - Yes, now. What have you got there? - Your soup - But I wasn't even here yet - That's how good I am Change of plan, you'll be in that room, the Compton Room - Why's that? - There's an Australian honeymoon couple in here Ooh, Mills and Boon. Bring my soup in, I'm starving, I could eat my own pants Oh no, what am I going to do? Francis, there's only one place setting in here. What you got there? - Your soup - Give it here then. What's the matter with you? I haven't eaten for sixteen hours Gareth! I've got two guvnors, both rooms, I need more of everything. Now, quick - Here's your cold meats - Smashing, over here Alfie Look at that! Ham, beef, what do they call this sliced sausage here? - Pepperonly - Beautiful - Sliced donkey - I like a bit of donkey. You sound out of breath Alfie Them stairs, they take it out of you. I'll turn me pacemaker up a couple of notches - Mmm, a plated meal? - Sliced meats - Where's that soup you had? - It was cold. I sent it back - Vichyssoise? - No. Back downstairs You're a bit of an enigma aren't you Henshall? Do you know what you remind me of? - What? - High Wycombe. Get me the wine list, would you? By which I mean I'd like to drown in a bath of grands crus What if I can't find Rachel? I may never make love to her from behind ever again Rule number one, for a waiter: don't eat the food - Soup for your other guvnor - Smashing. And he wants a wine list - No empties? Have you cleared that room? - Alright, alright - Next up is your Quenelles de volaille - Ah, my favourite My Nan used to cook kweneldevolay every bonfire night - Chicken balls - Really? I didn't know chickens had... I never understood soup. You don't need a knife and fork to eat it, so it's not food It must be a drink, in which case I'd rather have a pint Francis... Yes guv? Can you clear our table please of the soup, and we'd like to order some wine Henshall... Mmm. Ah! Oh. Ah. Winerama Yes, there's some soup left in here. Will someone look after this soup for me?

Ted and Calista were brother and sister And so it begins When they got frustrated with just being related And wished to be twins And it didn't matter that she was much fatter And he was a man In spite of a few quibblings, these curious siblings Came up with a plan Sunday and Tuesday they'd wear her clothes Wednesday and Friday, they'd wear his What happened on Saturday can't be repeated But people would stare And say, look there goes that mixed-up shook up pair She wore the trousers and ironed the trousers While he did their hair They always looked dashing... If anyone shouted they'd soon get clouted and brought down to size Sunday to Tuesday, they'd wear her clothes Wednesday to Friday, they'd wear his What happened on Saturday can't be repeated But people would stare And say, look there goes that mixed-up shook up pair They'd parade themselves through the town Although their heels gave them blisters The world would be a more colourful place with a few more Ted and Calistas Sunday to Tuesday, they'd wear her clothes Wednesday to Friday, they'd wear his What happened on Saturday can't be repeated But people would stare And say, look there goes that mixed-up shook up pair In stilettoes there And say, look there goes that mixed-up shook up pair In the pin-striped three-piece suit And say, look there goes that mixed-up shook up pair There they go! Well, I know that you want to wait, girl That it's only our seventh day, girl But my heart starts to pound, girl, when you take my hand And I know that you like to tease, girl Cos I think that I felt you squeeze, girl But I need to be sure so please, girl, tell me where I stand It's time to give it up, baby Come on, you keep me waiting all night Come on, it's time to give it up, baby Come on, you gotta keep me right Ooh, well I know that you feel it too, girl Don't pretend that you don't, you do, girl This rejection makes me blue, girl Help me understand Come on, it's time to give it up, baby Come on, you keep me waiting all night Come on, it's time to give it up, baby Come on, you gotta keep me right, ooh Give it to me, give it up, baby Give it to me, give it up, baby Give it to me, give it up, baby Yeah! Destiny. Destiny. Destiny. What is destiny? If you're a bus, your destiny is the bus station And if you talk to buses, as I do, they tell you that their destiny is writ deep in their bussy souls It is inescapable, it is The Timetable Buses laugh at love. Love is fluff, very fluffy fluff. Destiny is steel - Orlando. What are you doing here? - I said I would return and take my revenge - et voilà - Where did you get that knife? - Woollies. My honour has been fiddled with Put it away boy. We, the educated classes, have our own weapons The law, contract, and my particular specialism: sesquipedalia verbis - Words? - Not just words, words a foot and a half long If sesquipedalia verbis fails, if Charlie refuses to allow me to marry Pauline, tell him he will have this to deal with What? Have the impediments before Alan's marriage to Pauline been removed as I demanded? No. And it isn't my fault. I thought Roscoe was dead Your precocious contract with Roscoe was initiated in order to facilitate a relationship of mutual expediency And as such is antithetical to the Judeo-Christian and common law conception of marriage The contract's legality is at best ephemeral... ...and in resurrecting it, following Roscoe Crabbe's own miraculous resurrection... ...is a classic exemplar of Breach of Promise. Post hoc ergo propter hoc - What you trying to say? - You're up shit creek without a paddle In my world there's a code It isn't written down, there's no books, but it's a code, like the law. I haven't got no choice, but to abide by it On reflection I am not sure that I want my son to dive into the fetid pond that is your family Yeah, yeah. Pauline's going to marry Roscoe and that's that. And I'll give you some Latin for a change. Que sera sera Bugger me, it's Errol Flynn - Is it true? - Yeah, it is true, yeah. What? - Is Pauline to marry Roscoe Crabbe? - That's right. Wait here, I'll get you a presents list Do not torment me. I am no longer responsible for my actions I am dangerous, unpredictable, like a wasp in a shop window - Where did you get that knife? - Woollies - What you going to do with it sunshine? - You've never shown me any respect My first Chekhov, I got you a free ticket to see me give my Konstantin - The Rottingdean players? - You never came. You went to play snooker I live in Brighton. I don't need to drive to Rottingdean to watch someone shoot a bloody seagull - Don't push me. I can do it - No, you can't. Cos this is real, it isn't a play - Alan? - Don't come any nearer Roscoe. I will, I can - Where did you get that knife? - Woollies It isn't the knife that's dangerous. It's the owner. Throw that away - No. I came here to kill Charlie - You don't want to kill Charlie, you want to kill me But you can't because, in the split second it would take to raise your arm, my knife will be sorting out your tonsils - Or have you had your tonsils removed? - No. I've still got them Roscoe! Please, don't kill Alan He don't mean no harm, he's only acting - Where'd you... - Woolworths. On the high street. Hardware and kitchens I'll spare him for your sake, my darling And I expect you, in return, to do me a favour, that is to respect our secret I do. I will Is that it then? Cos I've got a cup of tea going cold in there Yeah, go indoors dad - Charlie! It's gone three o'clock - What? You're not telling me you haven't got your money yet? I don't believe it. I told Dolly to... If you want anything done properly, you got to do it yourself. Go indoors Roscoe. I'll sort it for you Alan, son. A word - Are you hurt my love? - Have you been with him? - Been where? - Bed - No, God! Alan. Really, absolutely no, not ever, never, no - The lady doth protest too much methinks - I'm a virgin. Still. You know I am - Don't I just I'm saving myself for you Alan, for when we're married, when we can do it two or three times a week legally No. I think your shared secret is that you've always loved him Sh-pow! You've bewitched him, like you've bewitched me, with your little prick teases You play a man like a penny whistle I loathe you - Don't talk like that Alan. I'll die - Do you think I care if you die? - I'm going to do myself in then - Go on then - How can you be so cruel? - I've had a good teacher He's not worth it love. He'd stand there and watch you do it, and not raise a finger Look at him. You're not the great romantic lover are you? You're a bit of a twat Let me give you some advice. Men, they'll do anything to get you into bed Lie, cheat, buy you a bed And the tragedy is once they've had you, they'll never want you quite as much ever again Don't take notes girls, there's a handout at the end I can't believe you would let me kill myself. You're heartless I'm going to die anyway, cos I can't live with this pain And when I'm dead, I want you to know that it'll be you what killed me Frailty, thy name is woman Women are born actors. Whenever they want something, enter from stage left the waterworks You want to watch your tongue young man, slagging us women off It's 1963, there's a revolution coming I predict in twenty years' time there'll be a woman in Ten Downing Street Yeah, and she won't be doing the washing up Then you'll see exactly what women can do You'll see a more just and fair society The feminine voice of compassion for the poor will be the guiding principle of government... ...and there'll be an end to foreign wars So I've eaten. And after a lovely big meal there's two things I just can't resist doing One is having a little smoke And that's the other It's alright this two jobs lark, cos you can do what you like all day And it don't matter if you get sacked cos you've still got the other job And cos you got sacked, you can sign on straight away. Why doesn't everybody live like this? Some of you out there, who understand your Commedia dell'arte, your hummus eaters... ...may have asked the question: 'Now that the Harlequin' - that's me - 'has eaten...' '...what will be his motivation in the second act?' Anybody here said that? Perhaps in an attempt to impress a date? No? Good. Nice to know we haven't got any dicks in tonight Now that my character, the Harlequin, has eaten... ...he has to find some other base motivation to drive his actions in the second half Your job is to try and work out what that might be Pauline's written one letter to Alan today, and one letter for Roscoe - Are we going then? Majorca? - Oh it's him. I like him - Have you ever been abroad? - No - It'll be great. Sun, sea, sand - Have you missed me? I have. A great deal. Life became unbearable without you I've got a letter here for your gaffer - Can I trust you with it? - 'Confidential' is my middle name - What are your other names? - Francis Henshall - So your full name is Francis Confidential Henshall? - At your service, gorgeous Calling a woman 'gorgeous' is patronising and chauvinist, obviously But since I fancy him rotten, and I haven't had a proper sorting out in a while, I'll forgive him You've got honest eyes - Thank you. Baby - No trouble. Big Boy A friend of mine likes you - What's his name? - Paddy - What's he look like? - Could be a movie star - Godzilla? - He's a good looking lad. He's big boned - And how did he get big bones? - The usual. Nature-Nurture - Partly genetic, partly pies? - He likes his food, yeah Does he prefer eating or making love? It's a tough one that, isn't it - Would you like to meet him? - I wouldn't want to interrupt him if he's eating Wait here, I'll go and get him. Don't put your glasses on I've done a lot worse. We've all done a lot worse, haven't we girls? We've all woken up the morning after the night before... ...taken one look at the sorry state of the bloke lying next to us, and we've all leapt out of bed... ...sat down and written to our MPs demanding that tequila should be a controlled drug Hello there. I'm Patrick. My friends call me Paddy and I'm in love with you, I am so - Are you really? - Yes, I'm a hopeless case - I'm like a cork, tossed on an ocean of desire - Is that difficult? It's exhausting. There's only so much tossing one man can endure I grew you a rose, so I did. I watered it myself, and did the Baby Bio thing... ...according to all them fancy instructions on the side of the packet there, so I did - That's very sweet of you - Any chance of a kiss? I'd better go. I left me horse on a double yellow He's like a big kid. I've always liked that in a man, immaturity What do you reckon to Paddy? Do you like him? - He gave me a rose - A rose? Go on my son, he's a terrible romantic, is Paddy - Bit of a ladies man is he? - No, he's a one woman man. He's the marrying kind - He's married is he? - No. The right woman hasn't come along yet Until now. That's what he said. What about you? One day? Do you want to get married? - Marriage is the legalised exploitation of women - Yeah, obviously Why can't you, Francis, as Francis, just ask me out on a date? I've asked you to go to Majorca I can't just go to Majorca with you. We need to go on a date first What's a good first date from a woman's point of view? - Candlelit dinner? - A candlelit dinner? That was quick! Shit, no wonder you're here with a bunch of women! That's the most terrifying thing I've ever seen in my life! What's a good date? 'A candlelit dinner!' 'Take me on a candlelit dinner, you bastard!' 'Buy me a ring!' No, she needs to feel relaxed! Secure, not under pressure. I know! Dolly? I was wondering... How do you fancy... Saturday, Saturday afternoon, not evening, no pressure... ...would you like to go on a rabbit shoot? I think you should take me on a candlelit dinner. Thank you! Then we can go for a walk after. We could give the relationship a go, see if it's got legs Excellent. In my experience four legs is enough to get started We could try those legs in a variety of combinations, and if that doesn't work... ...we'll have a trial separation, and if that works, we'll have a total separation - You've got it all worked out haven't you Francis? - I'm a man. We plan We don't just go into stuff with our eyes closed because it feels right, like you women do Everything needs planning. Love is no different from... I don't know, building a petrol station You can't build the shop before you've sunk the petrol reservoirs Surely you can build the shop before you sink the reservoirs... ...if you don't build the shop directly on top of the reservoirs? Look, you're not going to win this argument cos I've actually built a petrol station, alright, in Luton - On a small piece of land? - Yeah, so? And it was crucial that we sank the reservoirs before we built the shop Otherwise we would have had to a) build the shop, b) knock it down, c) sink the reservoirs, d) build the shop Which might well be how a woman would build a petrol station And I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that, apart from the fact that it's brainless I'll tell you how a woman would build a petrol station She'd make sure there was enough land so that you could factor in a pleasant walk from the pump to the shop - Maybe lay a bit of a lawn down - A lawn? With some flowers. And a rockery. And somewhere for the kids to play Kids? And a separate toilet block for the women which has three times as many cubicles as the men's - What do you want all that for, it's a petrol station? - Yes, but it could be a nice petrol station Nobody in their right mind wants petrol stations to be nice. It's a bloody petrol station It's not going to work is it? Me and you. Men and women That's a shame, cos I really fancy you - Thank you. I've always wanted to be a sex object - It's better than not being a sex object isn't it? Grrr! - We're supposed to be going to Majorca - You can't deliver Majorca Francis. You're a loser - Who's this letter for again? - Your guvnor. Don't open it - I have to find out who it's for - Just give it to your boss - It's not as easy as that - I can't see what the problem... - Look, there's no name on the envelope - What do you need a name for? Because... I can't tell you. It's actually very complicated and really you don't want to know Aaargh! - What's up Dolly? - No idea - Francis. What's that? - It's a letter for you - Why didn't you just say it was for Roscoe? - Because I'm a woman And I'm really stupid and I can't be trusted to do anything properly Men! - This letter's been opened. Francis? - I'm Francis. Yes? - This is the second private letter you've opened today - I haven't read it. Honest, guv. Test me on the contents - Alright. Who's it from? - Cilla Black - Incorrect - I told you I hadn't read it This isn't going to work. All he's got to do is make up a stupid answer Mr Duck, please. That is what a dishonest man would do. Me, I'll try and answer every question correctly - cos you're a simple, honest man - Without any artifice I don't have any qualifications at all A second private letter has been opened. I have no choice, you're sacked Please don't! You are... Thank you for the opportunity. - No! I opened the letter - Come again? I'm worried sick about Pauline. I can't help her if I don't know what she's up to. So I opened the letter and I read it You've read the letter? I don't believe you. I think you're just trying to get Francis off the hook Test me. On the contents Oh bloody hell, you can't believe her. She'll be trying to get well in with him. I know you, around men What? And I don't know you Charlie Clench? I know how the business works, I know where the money goes - I know... - Yeah, alright, alright. You're very knowledgeable I'm going home. Nice to see you Francis. I like your friend, Paddy. He's not an idiot I promise I can change I'll go and see my mate Dino. Give me ten minutes. Carlotti's Amusements on the front - I don't want it in pennies - Larger denominations are available - Dino Carlotti is solid, he owes me one - That's what worries me You don't owe me one Charlie, you owe me six Pauline is in a bit of a state, fearful of what Alan might do. Maybe it's time to come clean - Where are you going? - Me? Come here Who's that hitting my man? What did you do that for? - What's my name? - Roscoe Crabbe - And what have you heard about the Crabbes? - Don't worry, we're not going there You don't mess with them If you need me, I'm in Carlotti's Amusements on the front. What are you going to do? I'm going to do your ironing, then I'm going to try and find Paddy on the pier, like I said - Who's Paddy? - Shit Paddy's a friend of mine who works as a butler to someone in Brighton He's going teach me how to iron properly so that nobody gets seriously injured Good man... Afternoon My nerves Henshall, what's going on? I swear I saw a chap slap you across the chops - Yeah, one of the locals - Country Life! What had you done? - I kissed his girlfriend - Out of the blue you just went up and kissed a chap's girl? Yeah. That's a bit Japanese I'm sorry, I'm afraid I'm on his side. Come here - What? - Come here. Stand there. - Oh guv, come on... - Stand still. Once more. - Watch the birdie. This one, this one, this one... - Ow, ow! Bamboozled you, didn't I? There we go! Oh, no, rozzer... Hello! - Afternoon - Is it? Well done, yes I'll give you one hour to finish my ironing that you never started And then I want you to go to the pier and find Paddy So that's the downside of two jobs. Double the bollockings We're good girls Good girls Not naughty girls We're nice And good girls never should girls Be accomplice to a murder more than twice If your man has done the deed And it's made him all knock-kneed Keep him calm and then proceed To offer this advice Lighten up and lay low Flee the scene of the crime Lighten up and law low No one wants to be doing time Tidy up and say 'Joe, if you want to stay free 'Keep schtum, lighten up and lay low with me' Be sure the weapon is dispensable Keep him sensible, do Provocation is defensible, true But do you wanna risk it? Lighten up and law low Flee the scene of the crime Lighten up and lay low No one wants to be doing time Tidy up and say 'Joe, if you want to stay free 'Keep schtum, lighten up and lay low with me' Yeah 'Keep schtum, lighten up and lay low with me' With me With me. Mr Stubbers is having a lie-down in room ten, Roscoe's still chasing Charlie for the money That's Mr Stubbers' shirts done. My plan is to finish all the ironing, then go and find Paddy on the pier Yes, I know Paddy doesn't exist But that's the sort of insanity that makes perfect sense when you've got two jobs What's that? It's a framed photograph of Mr Stubbers. But these are Roscoe's shirts What is my guvnor number 1 Roscoe doing with a framed photograph of my guvnor number 2 Mr Stubbers? Henshall, is there a shirt ready yet? What are you gawping at Henshall? Never seen a man naked from the waist up, eh? Don't tell me you're one of those chaps that didn't shower That's how we won two world wars The Germans had superior technology, but our officers showered together - What's that? - Sorry guv, that's mine This is a framed photograph of me on graduation day. It's the very one I gave to Rachel, I think Is it me? Yes, that third class degree in Zoology has got my name on it Why do you have a framed photograph of me in your possession? - Are you developing a thing for me? - No guv. It's a nice frame - Where did you get it? - I've got to be very careful what I say here I bought it off Paddy, who was given it by his previous employer in lieu of payment before he died - Before he did what? - Before he did die - He did die, did he? - He did - What did he die of? - He was diagnosed with diarrhoea but died of diabetes - He died of diabetes did he? - He did, didn't he - Where you there? - When? When he was diagnosed with diarrhoea but died of diabetes No, I was in Didcot, and he was diagnosed with diarrhoea but died of diabetes in Dagenham - When did he die? - Of diabetes? Or of diarrhoea? - He didn't die of diarrhoea he died of diabetes - He did, did he? Where? - In Dagenham, damn it. That's what you said - Paddy told me it was a couple of days ago Then Rachel is dead. She is all I live for Grief, grief My girl... my love... my life... She's... ...everything. There is nothing without her Sorry. That went quite well Oh shit! It's my number 1 guvnor Roscoe, with Mr the Duck I'm disappointed in Dino. It's not like Dino to let me down. I'm glad you didn't take his cheque What's a cheque? A cheque is a promise. And a promise in this modern world is about as much use as a nun's tits Charlie, please I'm sorry. Did I offend you? I thought we were all men together Your failure to deliver means that I will have to change my plans - Give me the weekend. I'm playing golf Sunday... - Shut it. Francis, look in my trunk, find my diary Oh, no. Can you remember which one's Roscoe's? This one....? Yes! Thank you so much. You, madam, are a life-saver. Here you go guv! Thank you so much! Thank you. This is not my diary You stupid cow! There it is! I've been looking all over for that, it's mine - But you handed it to me, thinking it was mine - The reason is.... I haven't owned a diary myself all that long, so I don't yet recognise it that easily This diary is Stanley's. These are the letters in which I express my love for him Letters and diagrams which celebrate the most intimate details of our love making. Oh my God! But how...? Francis. How come this diary and these private letters are in your possession? I've got to be very careful what I say here - I bought it off Paddy - The ironing expert? Yes. Who was given it by his previous employer in lieu of payment before he died. He died did he? - He did - How did he die? - He died of disease - Where? - Where was the disease, or where did he die of disease? - Where did he die of disease? - Dorking - And where was the disease? - In his diaphragm - So he died of a disease of the diaphragm in Dorking? - He did didn't he? - Do you know Dorking? - I don't. Do you know Dorking Mr Duck? - Indeed I do. Dorking is directly north of here - One might pass through Dorking on the way to Brighton? - If you're daft and don't know what you're doing, definitely Definitely Stanley... Stanley dead? My love, dead? No. This cannot be. Without Stanley my life is nothing I do not want to live, here, on this earth, alone without him I have given him my life, my love, my body - Bloody hell, he's a woman - Roscoe? You're not Roscoe, you're Rachel Yes. I am in disguise as my twin brother. Who is also dead I have lost a brother and the love of my life both in the one week You proper fooled us. I take my hat off to you I guess it was easy enough cos you and Roscoe was identical twins Roscoe was a man. I, as you can see, am a woman. So we cannot be identical twins Why not? Excuse me gentlemen. I am in mourning. For a brother and a husband I better go tell Harry Dangle this. His lad will be chuffed to bits Unless he's been and gone and done a Hamlet by now - What's a Hamlet? - A Hamlet is when you flip, kill everyone including yourself - That's a bit rash - Not rash enough The last time I saw it, it took him five hours What do you want? I've felt atrabilious enough already today - I hope for her sake she enjoyed it - Speak man, speak My girl Pauline is free to marry your Alan. That Roscoe has turned out to be ineligible Whether he is eligible or not counts for nothing. Pauline has been seen with him, they have been together He's a woman. Two girls together. Nothing could have happened Turn, hell hound, turn - I got news for you sunshine - Yeah? Roscoe is really Rachel. He's a girl You mean all this time she has been in disguise as her twin brother? - Exactly. You and Pauline, it's back on - Really? Yeah. What would Shakespeare say? Go for it son O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful, wonderful, and yet again wonderful - Is that Shakespeare? - Yes. As You Like It I'm disappointed. I could've done better than that myself - How does Pauline feel about this? - She don't know nothing about it yet Why don't you come round and we can take turns trying to explain it to her My God, Rachel! Rachel, I love you! - Rachel, no! - Stay there Lloyd - What you doing girl? - I will Lloyd, I will Stanley is dead. I love him. He is everything. Without him this life has nothing to offer me - Rachel? - Stanley? Mr Pubsign? This is my Stanley. Stanley Stubbers. Who I thought was dead Oh, I understand - Rachel, my darling, I thought I'd lost you - I cried Stanley, you don't know how much I cried - Can I make a suggestion? - Yes, Lloyd Don't you think it might be a good idea if you both stepped down from off of that railing there? So you can talk, and don't be throwing both your lives away over nothing no more Good thinking - My little badger - My hairy bear - My time to go - Lloyd, wait Can you do me a favour please? I'm pretty certain my minder is behind this Drag his backside down here could you so that I can tear him off a strip - I will - Thank you Lloyd - I can't say no to you. You're like a daughter to me girl - You're the very best of men Lloyd - Has anyone ever told you that? - Yes... - Badgie! - My hairy bear! But what made you think I was dead Badgie? I was scared after the fight, and I hired a minder for protection, and he had these - Bacon and eggs! That's my private diary - And all the love letters I've ever sent you - No! - He said he knew a man who'd worked for you - For me? - For you But you'd died, and you'd given him the diary in lieu of payment on your death bed I don't remember doing any of this - Did he read any of your love letters? - I can't be sure Let's hope not eh, some of them had some really good bits But how come you thought I was dead? Because I was lying low I had to hire a man to go to the Post Office for me And this man had in his possession that framed photograph The very one I gave you, because you said you needed a visual aid for your... you know... But how come your man had my photograph of you? He said he'd got it off of a friend of his who'd been given it by his employer, who'd died So I thought you must be my chap's friend's employer who'd died - Did you feel terrible, hairy bear? - I've never felt worse I felt like a floral clock in the middle of winter - That's exactly how I felt. All the flowers dead - And yet the mechanism of the clock pointlessly turning - The hour hand pointing to a dead geranium - The minute hand stuck on a long gone begonia That's what I like about us - If I say there's cats on my curtains, you say... - ...There's dogs on my wall Oh God, baby, I've missed this. Damn it, I've just remembered. Your twin brother Roscoe is here in Brighton looking to kill me - Roscoe is dead. He died instantly - When I killed him? - Yes - Someone told me he was staying at The Cricketers Arms - No, that was me, disguised as my brother - You're not staying at The Cricketers Arms are you? - Yes - Lucky dip, so am I. Have you got a double? - Stanley, I can't think about that right now - Really? I can't think about anything else I'm afraid, I've been thinking. I'm sorry, I really don't want to go to Australia Oh thank Christ. I never did. I can't stand bloody opera What can we do? - Could you marry a murderer? - I guess I'm already in love with a murderer - Who? - You Oh God, don't do that! I will marry you if we can find a way of staying in England - Here's one of the troublemakers - Not the worst of the two, I'll wager - Thank you Lloyd - No problem Yes, thank you Lloyd, but in an ideal world, we'd have both of them here Yes, that's true, we must have both of them here Lloyd It wouldn't be cricket, would it, to light a fire under one and let the other off scot free He's the only one I've seen. Alfie might know - Alfie, have you seen the other gentleman? - There's new toilets at the end of the pier - Have you seen this Paddy? - We had to put newspaper down because I'd had a banana May I? One moment in private with the lady? Wish me luck - It's all his Paddy's fault - We must punish this Paddy I have a completely brilliant plan to do just that. You know Charlie Clench's book-keeper Dolly? What's she got to do with this? His Paddy is trying to trick her into going for a dirty weekend in Margate - How do you know? - Paddy showed me the handcuffs He only wants her for body, whereas my intentions are pure, I love her - When did this happen? - About half past ten this morning I've asked her to go to Majorca with me, only I can't afford it. I need fifty quid and next week off It would certainly be revenge on Paddy, and much more satisfying than a punch in the face He nearly caused two suicides And you'll be rescuing Dolly from two days face down, handcuffed to a Margate four poster Here's fifty It looks to me as if Paddy is the cause of all our problems - We've got a plan. - Leave this to me. One moment, Miss This is all her Paddy's fault When you find her Paddy, tell him he's going to get a beating from me Don't even think about it Listen, I've come up with a completely brilliant plan to punish Paddy without any physical risks to ourselves There is this really sweet, shy, innocent young girl I know called Dolly - Is she a virgin? - Definitely I went out with a virgin once. Not for long, obviously, that would be stupid Paddy is trying to trick her into going for a dirty weekend in Margate - What a Country Life - I know Paddy only wants here for her body - Bit of a bra advert is she? - She's beautiful I do like buzzwams As long as she can remember, her whole life, she has always dreamed of visiting Majorca... ...but she hasn't got the fifty quid for a ticket If you could pay for her to go to Spain, she'd much rather go there instead of Margate You'd be rescuing her from Paddy's evil scheme and punishing Paddy at the same time That is brilliant. Let's have a little looky. Yah, yah, yah, here's fifty. Get down to Thomas Cook and buy that poor girl a ticket Thanks. Now, do you think we should let her go to Spain on her own? No, not Spain. Not with their men. Can't trust a Spaniard alone with a swiss roll - When's this dirty weekend? - Week after next Let's have another little looky. Yah, yah, yah, here's another fifty, sterling. You're just going to have to go with her yourself And if anything does happen between you, at least the cherry was plucked by an Englishman A hundred and fifty quid! That's two flights and fifty spenders. I'm a genius - Rozzers! - Oh my God What do we do? Split up... Meet at Charlie's. Alfie! Brighton line Brighton line London to Brighton line London to Brighton line. How long's this going to take? I should have finished work at six And in an ideal world I'd be home by now relaxing in a hot bath with a fireman Come on Pauline, forgive the lad. He made a mistake. We've all made mistakes. I married your mother Listen, will you. Alan thought you'd gone off with another feller, so he went into one. Who wouldn't? - The pain you now endure... - Oh no, he's started up again ...matches my own suffering. I would wake every day and pray for clouds, for clouds bring gloom And gloom is all it would be without you, Pauline Sunshine would be an invasion, out of place, unwelcome, like a big horse in a pub Acquit my boy, lovers are lunatics, imagine what delights a reunion would unleash - Magnum bonum - Steady on - You've been very cruel - She sighed, did you hear that, that's good Progress. A sigh is like lightning, rain will not be far behind You've been really really horrible to me recently Alan - There is tenderness there - She called him Alan I would cut myself and offer you my blood, but first observe my tears Cor, look at that! He can turn it on like a tap. You got to give it to him haven't you. Amazing - Where's he going again? - RADA Turn around girl, you can't miss this, he's actually crying real tears - Is he crying properly or just acting? - There are tears, yes - Don't cry Alan - Excellent. Them tears done the trick - Pauline, will you share your life with me? - Come on girl - I don't know, you said you loathed me - Oh shit I did loathe you, yes. But that was in the distant past, this afternoon... - ...when I was tossed on the ocean of love's vagaries - Eh? - I was deranged, aberrant, demented - I don't understand Sorry. I was... - 'on tilt' - Like a pinball machine? - Exactly - Oh you poor thing - We're home - And dry - Do you forgive me my love? - Well... It's Lloyd, with a woman and a man and Roscoe's minder Let them in dad, please, I want to know if Rachel's alright 'If Rachel's alright'...? What about me? I do forgive you Alan. That's what love is isn't it. Forgiving someone when they've been a right twat My heart is now in your hands - Yes! - Done! - Charlie - I want a word with you Lloydie You're supposed to be my best china. Did you know about this? Yessir, I did. What I did, I did for her. She's a great girl, she's like a daughter to me man I apologise to you Alan, and to Charlie, for disguising myself as Roscoe I guess it was the obvious thing to do, given you was identical twins Charlie, it is not possible to have identical twins of different sexes - You say that... - 'Identical' comes from the Latin root idem... ...meaning 'the same' which has been bastardised in the English to 'ident' - What about 'ical'? What does that mean? - Small, yeah In Jamaica an 'ical bit of cake' is a small piece of cake Yeah, so ident-ical means 'the same but an ical bit different' With identical twins that might mean the same but with some small differences - Like gender? - Yes I'll do this once Charlie and once only. Identical twins, also known as monozygotic twins... ...develop when a single sperm fertilises a single egg to form a single zygote Hence monozygote, which then splits and forms two embryos which carry identical genetic material Dizygotic twins are formed when two separate eggs are fertilised by two separate sperm... ...to form two separate zygotes Twins of different genders must be dizygotic, they cannot be monozygotic, identical twins... ...because they would have to be, by definition, of the same gender - What's your point? - Charlie! - Let me explain! - Forget it, you're flogging a dead horse Charlie. This is Stanley I'm so glad everything's worked out for you. I'm sorted with Alan now and all Yeah, it's all good. I'm glad it's sorted, I can relax now - You still owe my father - God rest his soul You owe my family, me, six grand - Fair do's. You can't argue with that Charlie - Was I arguing? I have every intention of paying it The money's not a problem Rachel, just give me a couple of years - Me and Stanley have decided to stay in England - What you going to do? - We're going to get married - Congratulations - And we're going to the police, to face the music - You do right. Let me tell you something The police love you. You rid the East End of Roscoe Crabbe - Oh, so you're the feller that killed her brother? - Yes. I shall plead self-defence What you need is a good solicitor. This is Harry Dangle. He's the best. He got the Mau Mau off But in Kenya the Mau Mau went on a rampage, killing a hundred thousand innocent men, women and children - Allegedly - Mm. Impressed I understand the only witness to the killing of Roscoe Crabbe was Rachel? Who is also your intended? In this country a wife cannot give sworn evidence against her husband in a criminal trial - What does that mean? - There are no witnesses to the crime - But I did actually kill him - No, you plead not guilty - But that would be lying - Lying isn't difficult. Here, give it a go Did you kill Roscoe Crabbe? - No - See, it's easy - Where were you on the day in question? - Argentina The prospect of two weddings, and a court case with fees. What a wonderful day Dolly, is that the man who's asked you to go to Majorca with him? Yeah. But I'll never get the time off. You know what your dad's like Dad. It's all very well us all having a happy ending but you haven't done nothing for Dolly - What's Dolly got to do with anything? - Rachel's minder has asked her to go on holiday with him If you give her the time off, that's like three happy endings isn't it No wait, Dolly, listen. Don't accept the first offer you get Another man is in love with you and is offering a different kind of holiday You spend your whole life waiting for one man, then two come along at once Like buses I've always said men are like buses. Smelly and unreliable - What's the choice? - A traditional British dirty weekend in Margate Nylon sheets, wood chip, and rain. That's forty eight hours with only a sex pest for company Sounds good, yeah. Or? - A romantic week abroad. Majorca. Sun, sand, sea - And my personal favourite, diving That's a clear choice. Now what about the men? - Paddy is offering Margate - Whereas with this man... ...next week, you'll be in sunny Spain - I thought you said the week after next? - Let me explain I agreed that he could have next week off I'm sorry Badgie, but how can you 'agree' something with my man? I have given Henshall the week after next off, and I've paid him one hundred pounds - I've paid him fifty pounds and given him next week off - Mm. Two weeks in Majorca - Francis? - Henshall? What's going on? - It's all Paddy's fault - Where is Paddy? I think he's outside Go and get him - Is that what you want guv? - Yes it is - Dolly, have you met this Paddy character? - Oh yeah - Do you like him? - Yeah. He's a bit of a charmer Now then, what's the craic? - Francis? - No, I'm Paddy. If you're looking for my bro he's outside I know what's going on here. Are you and Francis monozygotic twins? That's it, yes we are Really? I'm going to go outside and bring your brother back in - Oh no, don't bother yourself, I'll go - No, you stay there. Go on Stanley Oh, grand. Oh, dear. Oh, bejaysus, Mary and the little donkey, I forgot to buy my swimming trunks - I'd better go before the shops... - Stay there - You little fucker! - Mr... - I thought Paddy worked for you - I thought Paddy was yours - Who does Paddy work for? - Oh man, he doesn't exist I made Paddy up. I've been working for you, and simultaneously at the same time for you I'm only one man but I had two guvnors I'm sorry you feel deceived, both of you, but I worked hard, didn't I? - I held down two jobs, and... - ...nearly caused a double suicide Only the man who never does nothing never makes no mistakes. You judge me as you wish to be judged Because you both deceived people today for love. You, guvnor, and you guvnor You can't criticise me for doing the same, for I too have fallen in love - Oh, sweet - He's right, there's no harm done - I forgive you. You can have next week off - I'd be a cad to complain. Take the week after next off too - Dolly, what do you say? - Charlie, can I have a fortnight holiday please? On full pay Oh bloody hell. This happy ending's turning out expensive - Go on then - Give her a kiss man STUBBINGS: Oh, yummy! A bunk up in Majorca. See, sometimes being a liar works. And with Dolly here, you got to say there's bound be some fireworks. I clocked on early, clocked off late Didn't eat till 2 I walked the walk and talked the talk And then I fell for you...
