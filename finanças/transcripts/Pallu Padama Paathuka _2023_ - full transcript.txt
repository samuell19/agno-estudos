KUNCHITHANNY FOREST Yes! Ah! AVOID USING YOUR TEETH This is a statutory warning for your safety. Please everyone listen to this carefully. Fanatics of war, lust and language have struck the world. Among them, the most important creatures are Zombies from "Ottuva Roti". What are Zombies? Zombies: are the brain dead Homo Sapiens, who have lost all their 6 senses. How do we identify a Zombie? Zombies look worse than human beings. They will always be found in groups with no sense at all. They appear from nowhere. The can't neither talk nor walk properly. They're pretty much the items which have lost their dignity and pride. Drooling mouths Red Heyes! Sharp Teeth. These are their traits. Why should we fear Zombies? If you don't fear them, then you'll be their lunch for the day. Zombies love human blood. Blood Sucking Good! Things to keep in mind: either if they bite you or they scratch you or if their flem is on you you can turn into Zombies too. Even so, you'll be turned into one. To save yourself from them dung sprinkles, black magic, prayers seeking Police help also screaming aloud nothing will work for you. Please close your mouth and run. There's no medicine for a Zombie's bite. So don't get fooled by fake medicines. With that being said, Teeth never learns its lesson seeks out the wrong tail. This is your Barry Hill signing off horny as a hound raging on the bed. Such long thing! Welcome Mr.Barry Hills. How are you, Barry Hills? I am Gopi!

Poor thing, Madam. If you have a cure for this, then why do we have to kill them? That won't work on them. All these are expired medicines. We have to kill them. How did you get these things? Who gave you this stuff? That's none of you business. You won't understand, even if I explain it. Now where will I hide my father? Father? What are you saying? And where is he now? Ah... that's him! Uncle! What happened to uncle? It all started because of him. What happened? '4 Years ago...' 'My father and I came down here to be part of a research.' 'It's a research center for Military Protection.' 'Confidential!' 'There were strict orders not to reveal anything.' 'A desire to achieve something big... Arrogance of being a genius.' 'So we worked hard without thinking about the consequences.' "Project Cthulhu" 'Instead letting one die, keep them alive trapped in the body' 'That's it' 'Staying Alive.' 'It happens to everyone, initially everyone laughed at us' 'No one believed' 'Except for my dad' 'Who am I? Is a question only a human asks himself' 'he won't rest in peace until its answered' 'The ones who went looking for that answer are the people who were researching in this forest anonymously.' 'It was being funded by a profitable businessman.' 'One medicine' 'Answer to all the cures' 'A bunch which disregarded faith and believed in intelligence' 'In this world, a good thing will come along with a curse' 'It was there too' 'Virus!' 'They never expected it' 'A disease which turns human who can't die' 'But they realized, death was a better option.' 'Only when the expectation brings in destruction a human will realize their mistake' 'Few things can't be won.' 'Also can never accept defeat.' 'Just one option left, undo the mistake' 'Have to get back where it all started' 'We did.' 'But not everyone think alike' 'Power' 'Desire' 'made its impact as usual' 'Few decided to use this in warfare' 'But there was one person, who decided not to let this out.' 'That was my Dad.' 'He initiated a fake incident inside the lab And tried destroying the virus.' 'He didn't stand a chance' 'It didn't get destroyed but it spread across' 'What can we do about it?' 'If you don't want an outbreak, it should be contained here' Patient No.213 Subject Name: Rohit Sharma. Govt. came to know of this... and put a seal on this lab to hide it from everyone. They made this a Radioactive zone. They spread rumors, stating there are ghosts and aliens out here. Whoever came looking for this forest... are the people just like you, who came to die here. Do you guys know one thing? There's no record of something of this sort happened. You're right! We don't exist. It was the same at Keeladi too. - Mahesh! he's sleeping. - Hey Mahesh. Wake up, damn it. Madam, life is uncertain. That doesn't mean you can never get married. Hey! Who are the men here? Damn! Oh! I was asking who are the men here? Me! Give me! Give me! "Make sure the teeth doesn't graze you." "Make sure the teeth doesn't graze you." Such a huge forest. - I wanna pee - I'm sweating What is this? OH! What happened? Who is on the top? We're going to check it out. Is it a virus? Virus can't climb trees. It feels like an Arnold's movie. Come on, sing. Sshh... Hey! Shut up! - Stop screaming - What are you guys doing? Revolting Mahesh! He is communicating with them. He's marvelous! - Is that so? - If they come closer they have to answer to 3 guns of mine. Come on, follow back. Follow Back! Hey... Arumai! Arumai! - On your shoulder - Shoul... shoulder A Frog! This Frog looks delicious. Eating its outer layer, gives you proteins. As it's a female frog, there are chances it'll escape. So lay it on its back and spread its legs. Come closer, I'll show you how. Now take this knife, hold it like this and stab it hard. Spread its legs, then put your little finger inside half an inch and mangle it. Then insert this bamboo stick into its mouth and push it in 4 inches. And play a track by Hip-Hop Tamizha. And your Frog Tandoori is ready. Henceforth we'll make an law and eat Tandoori Frog. In Yaashika army, they have listed the steps. about how to eat a frog. If you're hasty, you'll end up vomiting. Correct, bro! I was talking about you. Bloody Serena Williams in a Pant and a Shirt. Frog, snake, lion creatures like this won't be seen next year. Andaman tribes are going to be here. Oh my God what a body, it's making me quiver. You're still alive damn it. There's lion one side and Linga on the other. Also ripe fruits hanging all the way. It may be called Kunjithanny Kaadu But there's no Kunji neither thanny, in fact it's not a forest itself. Come on, I'll teach you how to quench your thirst for water. If you mix cumin seeds in your urine... Your little buddy will be saluting hard in the cold breeze. Tell me, who are you people? You're drinking urine like its mineral water... Who are you? You're holding the gun inverted, who are you? Mahesh... Revolting Mahesh! King... King of the Amazon Jungle. Barry Hills! Toll!? Toll inside a forest? What will you do with the money? Good question. I'll check with him later. Is it single or double? I'm single right now, but I'll be double soon. Make sure you're away from him. You guys can't go past without paying the toll. 'Because the dense forest you're about to enter... Insects, reptiles, frogs etc... You can't find any of it in this forest. Why so? 'Cause I ate them all. Toll!? You're done. Get lost. Get lost damn it. - Toll! - Get lost. He can be used in emergency. Don't you know, beyond 15 minutes Toll shouldn't be collected. Disregard 15 minutes. Just make it erect for 5 minutes, you don't have to pay. You're being vulgar. It's monstrosity, damn it. - I'm leaving! - Get lost. Look at Panchanli hop. - Get lost! - Get lost! Where is she going? Where are you headed Lakshmi Menon? I'll rip your mouth into pieces. Are you being a sarcastic hair? Why are you being abusive? Listen, hereafter they're your responsibility. I can't beyond this. Hey don't leave this ho with me. Who are you calling a ho? I meant you damn it. - You didn't call Madam, right? - No I didn't. Listen, if I fuckin' see you guys again near the forest That's it. Did you or not make it stand for 5 minutes? - Ask him not to accuse her. - Mahesh, don't keep shaking your rear. Listen to me, damn it. Look, she's finally alone. This is the right time to propose. Go and give her the letter. If you go tomorrow, she might swear on you. Go man. Go! Madam! Madam! Madam, I... Listen to me, and leave from here. That's about it. You should speak your heart. You should live the day, that's what Mahesh is about. Are you worried about your father? We'll take your dad to a good doctor... We'll get him cured for good. You don't seem to understand what's happening here. You don't seem to understand. If we hadn't met outside this forest, it's a different thing. But if we have met in this forest and speaking to each other... It's fate! No one can cheat it. Just for you... I've written a love letter. - Please read it. - I'm not in a position to take a decision. Please understand Mahesh. In spite of saying so much, If I happen to give this letter to you... I won't spare myself. Madam I love you! Finally we caught you. Madam, are you feeling shy? Madam! "Heyes are dying to get a glimpse" Oh no, Madam! Madam! GOPI'S HOUSE "Gopi's House" Is it Badava Gopi or Mime Gopi? Gopi! Gopi! Hey, you guys are relaxing as if you're on a picnic. Gopi, two guys out there - too her away - Two guys? Hey don't you get it?

Hey, I'm saying she's been kidnapped I don't understand what you're saying. How do you expect to know everything in a day? I've been here for 2 years... And I don't understand anything. Useless guys! Kunjithanny Kaadu contestants. I'm going to play a short film now. You will see how people who wish to sleep with Sathya get screwed royally. Condolences for the fallen Winter 7:30pm current year. This seems to be an unsolved mystery in Kunjithanny Kaadu. The voices heard in middle of the night we can concur that group sex, orgy, gang bangs are a very common thing over here. If we look at this infrastructure... How can you betray him? He gave a huge responsibility. And you went and fucked it up. Believe me... One day we will be rewarded. He won't do squat. He won't do anything for us. How long do you expect us to be his prey. Shouldn't I hunt as well? Only if there's a dancer, there will be a dance floor. How many are going to pounce on one guy? He squished them! It's going to turn out ugly. It's better to shut your mouth and ass. Oh God, that was close. - He bloody killed him - Late reaction! Such rage is not good for Loose Mohan. Loose Mohan!? - That's Charlie Chaplin - I've seen him somewhere - I can't remember - that's Solomon Papaiyaa Charlie Chaplin... Charlie Chaplin Bloody State Board candidates. My dear friend...

Show me your face she never said anything to you? Mahesh! He's lying! He died and is lying a corpse for 70 years now. My dear, it was a dead corpse. But a person born to the guest, dug out the corpse and did research on it. Who is that? Mahesh! I'm well aware of that idiot. Rohit Sharma! Suicide corpse, has been stored to its prime. Germans are genius. Bringing back the dead is not called science. Are you doing black Magic here? It's medicine, Dad. What do you want me to do now? I discovered a virus which can heal itself. They mutated it and turned into a virus which killed many. We came with a notion, but that's not happening. Fine, do something Dad. 'The pre-mature research of father and the daughter The Hitler was cut loose.' 'Due to over dosage, he got so turned on... that he screwed anything that moved.' 'Then it got fed up of the usual and was longing for a deeper contact.' 'That deeper contact is Sathya.' 'He's the one how trampled millions of lives in split seconds.' 'He tortured them daily' Do you remember your last words before you died? What did I say? You could've lost now, but you will win one day. I will be with you again at that time, we'll meet soon. Its their first night. Let's leave them alone. We'll see about that. Boys! Follow me! Furor, please have this. Let me know if you feel something. I can only say... Mr.Hitler! It's been 45 years since your death. Matter is going to be tough. Let's see.

Boss, Mahesh and his friends have come to save her. Tie her down. I'll see how they are planning to save her. Great they're here now. Now they'll know Sir, it was them who were planning. You guys leave, I'll take care of them. I remember this slang from somewhere. Hey Partha! You're still alive? Oh-oh, ok. Don't shout, why have you guys not escaped? I sacrificed my life for you guys. I won't leave without saving Sathya. That's impossible. Earlier he was just in love with her. The moment you stepped into her life... He's aggressively determined to nail her. When you said nail her? Which one is it? This or This? Ah! How many will nail her? I think he died a virgin in his previous birth. He's horny since his return. Then how did he survive all this while? - Sausages! - Sausages? All of you? Yes! Didn't you die this afternoon? How did you grow so much beard? - They served me hot! - Oh the beard is a side effect. How do I save Sathya now? He's impossible. Damn! Come on! You guys are slow! This is Hitler's sex bungalow. This is where he has kept Sathya. Huh! How many are behind Sathya? Either ways you can't do anything, so get lost. Bloody Curd Rice, where are you going? He's heading out to shave. Let him go. Let go! The gate is open, let's get inside. How come there's no lock at Pochinki Palace? Hands Up! Hey! Show me your hands. I just held it in my hand. How can I let it go right away. Hey! Turn around. I can't. - What do you mean? - It'll take at least 2 minutes. Do you know what's in my hand? Do you know what's in my hand? - Mahesh! - Hey, Arav! - You're still alive - You're still alive - Hey move away - I'm not a zombie He looks like a burnt Pulav, and you're calling him Arav. What are you doing here? Sri Reddy added me to the list as well. I came here to die. But these people got me instead. If so, did Hitler do it to you too? I would've have been his breakfast. But one girl saved my life. - Sathya! - Sathya! Why is everyone shocked? Hey Arav, tell me what else has happened? How many are inside Arav? When is the festival going to start? - Arav! - Stop it! Mahesh! Saving her is not an easy thing. Stop shaking your dirty hands. Ah! Sorry brother. It's not an easy job to save her. - Is it so? - Ya! If we follow these 5 rules It's easy to rescue Sathya. Ok master! Number One: Have to rescue her in 15 minutes. We should kill Hitler. If not Hitler with her... Why is he crying? Did he try his luck too? He's saying, she'll get screwed. Number Two: no matter what happens, don't let your tool out. Ah when did we take our tool out? Number Third: no one should go alone anywhere. Unity is like Medhu Vada. If so, Matter must be Masala Vada. If things doesn't work out, escape from there. Don't let your mantra down. Did you hear that? The last one, which everyone in this forest keeps saying Make sure the Teeth doesn't graze you. If this grazes, it's poisonous. Today will be her... Hey, Sinchan! Let that all go, we don't have time. We only have 15 minutes left. Let's get going. Hey... where's that Oviya's husband? He never mentioned about this. Why is he placing his ear? What is it? I can't see anything. Damn it!
