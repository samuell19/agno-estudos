MERKALA BEACH Do you know that one? No. I never saw her. A whore, this is easy. How much have you got? You think, I'm going to pay her? Wait here. Ready? It's late. I've got to go. For you. I got it cheap. I saw you look at me. When we got to the quarry, I remembered the night the police took us at Bou Kach Kach, and I remembered you looking at me. I turned around and left her there. And then you got drunk. Whore. So you're not in jail. It is one o'clock in the morning in Tanger. It's the smallest bird I have ever seen. It's a young bird and can't fly. A gold collar for the sultans of the birds. The son of a whore. He was waiting all the time to steal something. So he stole my ring. Yours? I thought you gave it to me. I'm not crazy yet. Do these fit you? They need new bottoms, but the tops are good. They fit. Take them. Hello. How much is this and this? 15 Dirham. 15 Dirham is too much,... I don't want new shoes. 13 Dirham. - Allright. 13 Dirham. Allright. You can get them in a week. Why don't you tell me where... your aunt's house is? I can't. Tell me. It's a secret. Tell me, I have to know. - You really live in a pension? It's convenient. They are for sale. I hope, I can sale everything. They're real leather. - No, no. We're going out. Hi. Good evening. You don't know her, she's from Meknes. Is it true, that you have given up kif? Yes, in the cafés. I smoke by myself in my room. And when you're offered it? I don't accept. Kif is expensive and in a café, there's always someone who's left his kif at home and wants to use yours. I'm going to get some cigarettes, I'll be right back. He's not coming back, you know. Will you come later? Don't wait for me after dark. How was it? All right for one night. Or even two. You thought I brought her just to be good to you! No, Sidi! I left her there to see if you were a friend. A scorpion! You fought? How is he? He was always drunk, anyway. CALL AT CORAZÓN Come on, faster! Don't touch that ball, this is our game, this is our field! Leave me alone! Get him! You don't have a mother! Allal, nobody knows who your father is! Get him, this son of sin. Attention! Look out for the snakes! Help me find my snakes! Find your snakes and get them out of here! Why did you bring them here? We don't want snakes in this town! Watch this for me a minute, my son. Get away with your snakes! Show that berrani the way out of the town! Out, out! Stay with me tonight. And the snakes? They have to be with me. They can come. You are not like the rest of them here. ... afraid to walk through the square because of a snake. You saw them. Shall I let them out? Fine! But you must sit and keep quiet. I've spent my whole life with snakes. I could tell you things about them. Did you know that if you give them majoun, you can make them do what you want, and without saying a word? I swear be Allah! Put them away so I can cook dinner. That was good luck, getting the snakes back like that, in the middle of the town. You can never be sure what people are going to do when they find out you're carrying snakes. Once in El Kelaa they took all of them and killed them, one after the other, in front of me. A year's work. I am going to sleep. In here! Good morning, my son. They're loose again! Stay where you are and I'll find them. Now I have got to find the green one. Do you want me to help you? No. Stay where you are, this one is very poisonous. Snakes are very clever, They can get into places that don't exist. Maybe it escaped through this crack under the door. I have to go to Taroudant, to the snake-market. She was a good snake. Good-bye, my son. ... did you know that if you give them majoun, you can make them do what you want, and without saying a word. I swear by Allah. Come here, come here... Come here... A snake! A snake! The tracks are easy to find in the sand. We have to kill it. It vanished into that pipe. Where does it lead to? Maybe to this old ruin. Here are the tracks again! Get him, he has gone crazy! It got me... ... that devil bit me! It's still in there. He's gone crazy. We need to put him away.
