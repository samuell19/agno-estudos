Fei-hung is out. Thank you for coming. Hand out the red packets — the gifts. I'll fetch them at once. Thank you, Master Tam. Your gift is precious. -Please go in and have some tea. -After you. Red packets! -Come on, it's for you. -Master Chiu has arrived. Your son won the Lion King competition. He's so famous now. Hand out a red packet. Master Wong, today is a big day. Your son and I must drink for three days straight! -Where is Fei-hung? -He's at the train station. Is this the lion head Wong Fei-hung used for the competition? I heard that this defeated thousands of other lions for the gold medal. They say Master Wong joined the competition in order to save someone. That's why he returned the medal to the government after winning it. What a hero! Isn't it fantastic? The Lion King competition began. -Then my master, Wong Fei-hung, appeared. -Wong Fei-hung appeared! He's the head of the Ten Tigers of Canton and the instructor for the local militia. He stood on the tower calling me, "Leung Foon, Leung Foon!" Who is Leung Foon? Why did Wong Fei-hung shout for help at such a critical moment? Leung Foon? Never heard of him. Never heard of him? He's famous! What a shame! LEUNG FOON About Leung Foon, his eyes are sharp and big. Look at me! Remind you of anybody? Leung Foon is the great and famous kung fu master from Meixian Province. He's known from Foshan to Macao, and Hong Kong too! Tell me when you see Master. I haven't seen Master yet. Let Foon keep on pretending. Leung Foon is Master Wong's number one student, and he's as famous as Wong Fei-hung. I know him so well. Guess who I am. I don't know. Don't you know? Let me tell you. I am Leung Foon. -It's him! -It's him! Wrong guy! Foolish people. They're so ignorant. Master! -Master! -What's the matter? Officials are coming. They look nasty. -Officials? -Yes. -What for? -To arrest someone. Impossible. Let's see. Your Excellency! The deputy governor is coming with his golden dragon and an official letter of congratulations for Master Wong. Please arrange a reception. Congratulations from the governor-general? Quickly! Prepare the fireworks to welcome the golden dragon. Hurry UP! Brother Foon, a golden dragon is coming from the east gate. -A dragon? -Yes, a big dragon. Coming for a challenge? You're stepping on my foot. CANTONESE ASSOCIATION -Brother, should we tell Master? -There's no time! Listen to me. Yan, get the lion head. Clubfoot, our association's banner. Don't forget the drum. I see them. They're outside the east gate. Give way, please! Here comes the Lion King! Excellency. What's the matter? A lion from the Cantonese Association is blocking our way. Blocking our way? Have they come to welcome us? It doesn't seem so. The lion keeps kicking our dragon. -Master. -Has the deputy governor arrived yet? They're stopped at the east gate. -Why? -A lion is challenging them. Brother Foon, keep your balance. Don't fall! Brother Foon, you're heavy! Shadowless Kick from Foshan! The dragon head mustn't touch the ground. I haven't lost face, have I? Dragon in the Sky! The lion head! Think you can catch the lion head again? Clubfoot! Master! Master! You're back? Why are you standing there? Hold the tail! Yes, Master. He must be Wong Fei-hung. Dragon in the Sky! -Master, watch the dragon! -Clubfoot, Rolling Tiger. -Clubfoot, Tiger Looks Up To Moon. -All right! They're up higher. Let's test you. Clubfoot, the lion head must face the dragon head. That's the rule. Got it? That's no problem at all! Clubfoot, keep your balance. Don't make any mistakes. I've got it. Excellent. So stable. The dragon ball! Dragon ball from the golden dragon. It's good luck. Catch the ball! Master Wong, good luck to you. Thank you very much. Ever successful! Ever successful! Clubfoot, let me send you up there. Once again! Master, I can't make it. Let me do it. Catch the tail! Yes! My respects! My respects! I am Deputy Governor Guan Shing-tao. Your Excellency, I am Wong Fei-hung from Foshan. I've heard of you for a long time. You're a great master of kung fu. We've seen the best today. -You really are the Lion King. -Thank you. You're welcome. If it hadn't been for this, we wouldn't have seen your fantastic lion dance. Master Wong refused the Lion King gold medal. And so His Excellency Li Hongzhang asked me to return the medal to you. Please, don't make me lose face. Please accept it. -Your Excellency. -Please take it. Thank you, Your Excellency. Please be seated. Thank you. Foon! Tell me, how should I punish you? I know what to do. I've packed up. I'll leave for Foshan tomorrow morning. -How about the ticket? -I've asked Uncle Kau to buy it for me. I'll go to the train station tomorrow morning. When you reach Foshan, write me a letter to tell me you're all right. Already written. No, I mean I'll write a letter right after reaching Foshan. You always disobey me. Brother Foon. What's the matter? Let me go back to Foshan with you. I'll be banished with you. Banished? Go banish yourself! I won't stop you from living by yourself. You have the night to think it over. Are you going to live in exile or not? -Your Excellency. -Master Wong. -Everybody, please. -Master. -Master Wong, please look. -An invitation? Yes. Why is there another Lion King competition? This competition is between the eight countries. Another competition? What a pity you're going back to Foshan soon. Why are the foreigners organizing another Lion King competition? This Lion King competition organized by the eight foreign countries reflects the current situation. The relationship between China and the other countries is quite tense. Our country is getting weaker and weaker. The challenge by the eight countries is designed to crush our spirit. There may be other tricks as well. To compete with the lions of the foreigners... It's quite a challenge. -I won't leave, no matter what! -I guessed as much. Master Wong. This competition is similar to a war. Our office has sent someone to investigate their forces. These are the plans designed by the foreigners. Golden eagle, giant clam. Long dragon, double horses. Flying phoenix, golden unicorn. I have heard that these lions are much bigger than normal. They are specially equipped. But I don't know how powerful they are. I hope you can participate in the competition with me and fight for our beloved country. Master Wong, it's different from the previous competition. I hope you'll come with us. Foon, guess what Master's answer will be. He must say, "I'm afraid we may be trapped if we participate in this competition." I am afraid we may be trapped if we participate in this competition. "But if we don't participate, our country will lose face. I think we should have a detailed plan." But if we don't participate, our country will lose face. I think we should have a detailed plan. Master Wong, are you going to participate or not? "In our present situation, it's pointless participating in this competition." Although we know this is a trap, we should take the risk anyway. I must participate in this competition! Master Wong. We're going to participate in the competition. Bravo! Shit. I can't stay for the competition. Oh, yes. -Get help from 14th Aunt. -Good idea! -14th Aunt! -How can she help? She has a news agency in Beijing. Go and help her deliver the newspapers. Beg her to let you stay. And ask her not to tell Master. That's it. Good idea, but... your ideas are usually terrible. MAN HING WOMEN'S NEWS Is this the Man Hing News? İt seems to be. -14th Aunt! -Have you got the wrong address? -14th Aunt! -Coming! -14th Aunt! -Who is it? It's me, Leung Foon. -14th Aunt! -Do you have Cantonese tea? Sorry. Beijing has no Cantonese shops. Why did you bring along so much luggage? You know, Master is so mean! So we didn't tell Master we came to help. We told him we were going to Foshan. Don't tell — Don't tell Master you're hiding here, right? 'Right! 'And you? Brother Foon was kicked out by Master. You bastard! What's happened? Brother Foon, I didn't mean to tell the truth. You always betray me! -I didn't — -Not another word! Follow me. Stupid. You deserved that! Let's have a look. So spacious! Will they publish the news of your arrival? Hey! Don't say anything without my consent. Siu-mo, come here. What's the matter? Look. This word is wrong. You should write it this way. And this paragraph. Move it down here so it won't be so disorganized. That's the way to print a newspaper. What about this? The words are not clear enough. Keep quiet. It's printed on the dress. You assaulted 14th Aunt. Brother Foon, I was about to say that — You always betray me. Now you want to frame me too? -Bastard! How dare you set me up! -What setup? What was set up? Foon, you must be insane! Someone is coming. Siu-king, open the door. Let me help her with the door! Miss Siu-king. -Let me open the door for you. -No, thanks. -Who is it? -Wong Fei-hung. -Why did Foon react so strangely? -Master is coming! Hide. Be quick. Master Wong. Don't tell him that I'm here. What was all that noise? Someone wanted to open the door for me. When he heard your name, he got scared and ran away. Does the man have big eyes? Right, that's him! And a guy like this. He is here too. And the other one, like this. Let's get out of here! Brother Foon, your luggage! What's wrong with you? Why shout at me? Clubfoot, hurry up! Why shout at me again? Brother-in-law, have you seen Sister to the train station? Where are they? Stop searching. They left when they saw me. Your sister asked me to take care of you. She asked me to take care of you too. Are you hoping she comes back sooner? I may write to her. What kind of special news is it? Why is it printed on cloth? Nothing. Look at it yourself. It's an article about the status of women in China. What kind of status do women have? So you only ever think about the men? So my sister isn't a woman? Sister's news agency is in real trouble. Look at all the newspapers. They're all piled up here. They don't sell. No one wants to read them. No matter what we print, it's useless. -Someone will read it. -Who? They'll make faces if I ask them to read them. CHOY LI FUT MARTIAL ARTS SCHOOL Of course! It's so generous of Master Wong. It's a gift from Master Wong. One for everyone! Stop fighting! Everyone gets one. Be careful! Don't break what's inside. What's inside the wrapping? There's only paper. Nothing else! It's a newspaper. The more news you read, the more you'll know about the world. The more you know, the more you can achieve. Is this paper that powerful? To be frank, my students and I come from poor families. We want to learn kung fu to earn a living. We haven't been educated, so we're illiterate. How can we read the newspaper? What a pity they can't show you how much they respect you. This paper is so dirty. Don't use it for wrapping anymore. Okay, just once. I think we should teach people to read before starting a newspaper. Or these papers will just be used for wrapping. I wish there were more people like you in the world. Your sister never praised me like this. Who's nicer, me or my sister. You're both nice. The maidens of the Red Lantern are coming! Come and look. -The Red Lantern? -Let's go see. We come from the four seas Our lantern is hung on the mast To recruit heroes Our god sends us the swords The angels change the clouds With their handkerchiefs The world receives our order Our words will be spread forever We fear not foreign guns For we use wind, thunder and lightning As weapons We are powerful Dressed in red, with little red lanterns. The maidens from the Red Lantern Sect! Cast the spell! Expel the foreigners! Red Lantern shines on the fairies! Expel the foreigners. We are enhanced with power! We use holy swords against foreign guns! -There's a riot! -Don't go there. It's too dangerous. -I'll wait for you right here. -All right! We have the willpower to protect our holy land! Throw the lanterns! Cast the spell! Hear my command! Return the holy land to us. Prepare the altar for the Lanterns! Expel the foreigners! Mister, please lend me the whip. Give way, please. The people in the apothecary shop are innocent! You can't kill innocent people. What's happening? The leased territory is ahead. The foreign troops are coming. Don't go there. You'll lose your life if they catch you. Have you seen Wong Fei-hung? -Master Wong? He must have left. -Left? Did you see him leaving? Go! You are maidens. What drives you to kill people, set fires? -Don't kill us. We're innocent. -I've come to save you. They are coming. Kill them! Yes! Let them go. Don't listen to him. Attack! Don't come back! -You may go now. -What is he saying? Go! Run for your lives! Who is he? He must be Wong Fei-hung. Wong Fei-hung? Go! Come here! RED LANTERNS SHINE Cast the spell! Red Ropes! Attack! The foreigners are coming! Run! They're over there. Fire! Your maidens have all left. Why haven't you? -Stop! Don't move! -Stay right here! Leased territory troops! Take the scum away. Go! Finish them! Get the whore away from here! The Red Lantern is showing its power, Holy Mother. -Watch out. Be careful. -Yes! Have you seen a Chinese fellow passing by the way you've come? No. I think the patient needs more medication. Let me help you. You'll go home soon. Don't cry. In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit... Miss! We have come to the conclusion that you should leave this place immediately. All right. If that will make you feel better. I'll leave now, but... maybe you'll need some more help later. I don't think so. Go. Child, let me help you open the door. Thank you. I saw everything. Our Father won't forsake those who devote their lives to others. Father, I hope there is a real God, one who can resolve the hatred between our nations. Otherwise, we won't escape from the coming disaster. Don't worry. God has arranged everything. May God bless you. Thank you, Father. Take care. Welcome to our army. Your predecessors sacrificed themselves in the anti-Qing movement. This is the eight-color flag of the Qing army. Lui, you'll have the chance to take revenge for your ancestors now. Iron Fist Wong. Bravo! I'm General Henlintak. Lui, Wong, tell these descendants of the anti-Qing warriors they have my full support to fight the Qing soldiers who invaded their land. I will kill you! Harder! You foul pig! Throw him back in the cell. In the shit hole. Wong Fei-hung! Did they torture you? Do you belong to the Red Lantern? Wong Fei-hung, I thought you were allied with them. I'm sorry. We must punish the Chinese rebels to protect our interests in China. This may also be a warning to the Chinese government. Moreover, the Manchu government uses such organizations to intimidate us. This will be a lesson for the Chinese. Make sure that this will never happen again. But this is China. Punishing and killing the Manchus could cost us our heads. The armies of the eight nations made a pact in Tientsin. Everything is set for a war against the Manchus. Then let us execute the Chinese tonight. Tomorrow, we'll display their corpses in the streets as an example. Yes, General! You won't get the chance to compete against Wong Fei-hung because they will execute him tonight. Aim! Fire! Kill him! There's the prisoner. Thank you. On your feet! Are you Wong Fei-hung? I am Father Thomas. I am sorry to have to bring you some bad news. You will be executed by the Germans within the hour. Wong Fei-hung! Executed? You devil! You will be punished by heaven! My child. There is only one God who can save you. It's the God who gave me this holy vestment, so they won't suspect me. Father, you should leave now. Open the door. Get up. Father, stay back. Capture him! Catch! My child, wait. I want you to help me. You must knock me unconscious too. -I'm sorry to hurt you. -Let me. -Why did you hit him so hard? -So they won't suspect him. Don't hit him anymore. It's enough already. Go! Hurry UP! OFFICIAL RESIDENCE - SHING-TAO -Thank you for your report. -Excellency. -Your Excellency. -Master Wong, get up. What? Wong Fei-hung is missing? Yes, Your Excellency. We saw the Red Lantern parade. Then I was separated from my brother. He hasn't come back yet. The capital is in such a mess. The foreigners oppose the Boxers. It's not wise to get any side angry. On the one hand, the foreigners want us to protect them. On the other hand, the empress dowager wants us to overlook the matter. -Foon. -What? Do you think Master is doing this to draw you out of hiding? Master knows how clever I am, so he's using this method to make me show myself. This method is quite new. No, Brother Foon. Master didn't need so many people to look for you. Just Clubfoot and me were enough. You can shut up! If you hadn't let 14th Aunt know, how would Master have suspected I was staying in the capital? Foon, behave yourself. Don't worry too much. I will try my best to find Fei-hung for you. Thank you, Your Excellency. Your Excellency, Fei-hung might be in the hands of the Red Lantern. -Ho Ian. -Your Excellency. -Gather information on the Red Lantern. -Yes! -Are there many Red Lantern maidens? -Perhaps. I think Wong Fei-hung may have been captured by the German military. I'll have to check it out myself. Your Excellency, let me go with you. In this matter, it's better for officials to talk among themselves. Please don't worry. My office carries some weight in the capital. It's bad luck staying with you two. One is dumb as a stone, and the other betrays me. Don't you think the street is quieter than usual? -You're just more sensitive. -Really? What's happened? Have we come to the wrong place? It's all red! The Red Lanterns shine. Here come the maidens! Kneel down to worship! They're the Red Lantern maidens. What beauties! I'm going to kneel! -Brother Foon, are you insane? -It's not so simple. Shouldn't we kneel too? I failed in courting 13th Aunt. Now I've got so many choices. Better let me go first! I'm Leung Foon. I'm strong and considerate. And I know how to make a maiden happy, if you get my meaning. How dare you! I want to know where Wong Fei-hung is. Haven't you captured Wong Fei-hung? How can this man claim to be the great kung fu master? He conspired with the foreigners to lock up our mistress. Wong Fei-hung is not that kind of person. Don't you dare accuse him! Do you think I'll believe anything you say? You want me to believe he's not involved because he's in hiding? Follow me to our main hall. Let's see how long he'll keep hiding. Don't be so stubborn. We don't know what happened either. How dare you! It's you who refuses to listen to the truth. -Burn the house! -Burn the house? -Be careful of the lanterns! -They won't have a chance to use them! -Let's get the leader first! -I don't think so! -Watch out! -My feet! Keep away from him! Red Lantern Shines! Brother Foon, let me handle this! She's too tall for you! Fetch a shorter one next time. No need to make it look good. They can't see us! You act like you mean it! Miss, why are you always pouncing on me below the waist? Burn out your dirty mouth! It's like that, is it? Let's see how you like it! Are you excited? But you're trying not to show it! Come on! Is this nasty stance one of Wong Fei-hung's? Wong Fei-hung isn't as smart as I am. Some more! Red Ropes! Let me catch them! That stings! Amazing Lantern! Catch it! Master, let me help you! Blow the powder off! Why are you lying down? That was a stupid idea. Come on! What... So many of them. Yam! Master! Clubfoot! Clubfoot is missing too! Master, only you can save me! Your Excellency, what can I do for you? I'd like to see Ambassador Henlintak concerning Wong Fei-hung. Your Excellency, I've never heard of Wong Fei-hung. In the German Territory, no one is allowed to interfere with our judiciary system. You imprisoned him without reason. İt is my duty to protect him. Do you not know the provisions of the lease? It's an agreement between China and Germany. Change it if you want to. Otherwise, settle it with another war! Damn you! What barbarians! Even you will respect our judiciary system. I don't think war between us can be avoided anymore. Indeed. The war will start tomorrow. Our lions are well prepared to fight your dragons in the square. You will find out whose system is the best! Fine. I will come for the competition! You will certainly be the losers! Your Excellency, what about Wong Fei-hung? I don't think they'll dare harm him. Let's go back. What the hell happened? The Holy Light shines. It must be a trial of the Cantonese Association! Why would we be on trial? The main hall of the Red Lantern! This is your main hall? Yes. We are divided into Red, Blue and Green Lanterns. This is our headquarters. This is also where we execute the foreigners. I don't care what it is. I have to go in. GREEN LANTERNS SHINE Wong Fei-hung! Return my country and my power. I fear neither mountains of daggers nor seas of flames! Heaven's troops come to expel the foreigners. We will sacrifice our lives for our beloved country! Mistress Miu San takes Wong Fei-hung to greet our Holy Mother. I am Wong Fei-hung. I've come to look for my family and students. If you know where they are, please let me know. Burn the incense for our Holy Mother! Mistress Miu San takes Wong Fei-hung to greet our Holy Mother. Wong Fei-hung, to enter our main hall, you must go through the Green Lantern position first. You will pass this test only if your feet do not touch the ground. Please! Fine. Thank you! Get down! I'll topple them all! Can you stay on your feet? Back to original position! Thank you! Blue Lantern shining altar! Wong Fei-hung, please pass. How do I pass? This is the Blue Lantern Whirl Position. Cross through this big revolving lantern, but without tearing any paper. If you can get through it safely, then you've passed. -Thank you. -Watch out! Back to you! Ether powder? Mistress Miu, why are you fighting me? If you want to get out, fight with me. Mistress! Give me the sword! Mistress Miu! We serve our own master. Go now. Thank you. Mistress! I'm fine. Don't worry. EXPEL THE FOREIGNERS Fekhung! Master! Dad, Clubfoot, are you all right? -We're fine! -Master, save us! Foon! Didn't you go back to Foshan? You're so mean. The candles are red. The heroes come from the local organizations. The phoenix flies from its perch. The dragon dwells in its cavern. The Holy Mother is here. Kneel down to worship Holy Mother! Are you the goddess Lotus? My family has not offended you. Why did you kidnap them? Please let them go. Climbing Heaven's Ladder! Master, what kind of kung fu is it? She can fly! These are just tricks. Our country is in trouble. Everyone is responsible for its safety. It is your duty to expel the foreign devils. I think you should join us and become Boxers. Join the Boxers? I have no dealings with gods or ghosts. I think you'd better seek help from others. Wong Fei-hung, why are you so stubborn? I have to punish you on behalf of our gods. Paper troops, obey my order. Cast the spell! Do you think such tricks can save our country? Do you want me to set them free? It's simple. If you can pass through my holy tower and the holy bridge, I'll let you all go. If not, you must follow me. Well, I'll have to offend you then. Climb the Holy Ladder! Catch! Take it back! Ah, it's only wires. Okay, let me come up and play with you! Right, maidens. Let's test your balancing skills. Now only the Holy Mother is left. You will be my student! Double Dragons Stance! Master's feet are tied! Go down! Not that easy! -Come here! -All right! Cut! Take it back! Come up! Cross the bridge! Your bridge is ruined. Why don't you release us now? Retreat! Master, my money was on you! No, I mean I was sure you'd defeat them. Burn the bridge! Fekhung! Are you all right? Fei-hung, I was worried about you. It's a real mess. If 13th Aunt sees Master holding 14th Aunt, there will be trouble. Fekhung! It's fine. Let's write to 13th Aunt to tell her we're safe. 13th Aunt is enough. How can he court 14th Aunt? 15th Aunt is coming next month. Oh, my God! Foon, what is it? Who's there? I want to comfort that maiden. But you don't even know her. So how can you comfort her? If I don't comfort her, how can I get to know her? They're back! Come out! Master! Master! Are you all right? I'm fine. Fine. They're fine. Of course, they can't compete with Master at all! How are you, sir? I'm glad you're back. Old Master Wong. Old Master Wong. We were up all night thinking of ways to rescue you. Then we discovered that the Red Lantern had paid a visit. We've just sent someone after you, but you're back now. Sorry for worrying you. The time. Shit! It's started. -Master Wong. -Your Excellency. General Guan instructed us, if we saw you, to ask you to go to Tun Chau Square at once. The dragons and the lions fight today. What? The Lion King competition is being held today? Right. The Lion King competition organized by the eight countries is today. Right, Master. It's today. Why are you so excited? -I thought you'd forgotten. -Think again! -Your Excellency, please show me the way. -Fine! Fekhung. 14th Aunt. Brother-in-law, let me go with you. If anything happened, how could I explain it to your sister? Clubfoot, follow me. Yes, Master! Foon! Why are you standing there? Come on! So Childish. Childish! Bastard! What a copycat. Our nine golden dragons must stay alert. Under the prize, there are machine guns. Nine dragons, go! They're blocking our way. We've got to find a way out. Dragons in the Sky! -Dragons in the Sky! -Dragons in the Sky! Dragons in the Sky! The yellow and red dragons are destroyed. We have many foes! Be more careful! Understood! -Halt! -We are the competitors. The competition has already started. Leave! What did he say? He said the competition has started. We are not allowed in. How come, Master? Master, let me talk to him. -Consider it carefully, Fei-hung. -Foon, Clubfoot, let's go. -We'll rush past them! -Fine! Don't let them leave! They went that way! Don't let them get away! Ride on its back! Be careful of it changing positions! Catch the dragon head! Let me ride that! The dragon of the Blue Clan is in trouble. Take the wounded away. Yes, sir! The great eagle is coming! White dragon, watch out! Yellow dragon, be careful! Sir, the red dragon is trapped! Close the gate. Hurry up! -Prepare to fire! -Close the gate now! Close the gate! Fei-hung, they're closing the gate! They won't! Hurry up. They're chasing us! Don't be afraid. I'm here. Clubfoot, you have no horse. You can't catch up with us! -Open it, quick! -Yes! Let's see who's faster! Damn you, Clubfoot. How dare you walk all over me! Shoot! They're shooting! Get down! Fei-hung, we made it! Watch out! It's coming! Just our dragon is left! His Excellency is in the middle. It's oil! Get away! Hurry UP! Excellency! -Fei-hung! -Excellency! Wong Fei-hung! You must take revenge for me. Your Excellency! Excellency! -We were too late. -What a pity. Excellency! Excellency. The officials from Tai Lei Temple send their condolences. The officials from Shun Tin Office send their condolences. Excellencies, we thank you for your condolences. His Excellency Li Hongzhang sends his condolences. His Excellency sends his condolences. Wong Fei-hung sends his condolences. LIBATION FOR THE DEAD A letter written in blood from Wong Fei-hung. I am the Lion King of the Qing dynasty. I was too late to participate in the last lion king competition organized by the eight countries. Now I am challenging the lion kings of the eight countries. If you accept the challenge, I'll meet you in two days' time in the same square. Let destiny determine who will win or lose. Wong Fe/-hung. Does Wong Fei-hung want to take revenge for Guan Shing-tao? Fine. Tell him that I will give him a chance to meet an even worse fate! Brother Foon, how do I look? Fine. Just look at Clubfoot, so maidenlike. To be honest, I don't think so. But I'm afraid we'll be found out. Don't worry! If we're recognized, I'll handle it. Let's go! Sister Foon, what does your maiden look like? She's like me, so lovely. We're so well-matched! Sister Yan, don't run off! It doesn't matter. We'll go after our own targets later. What for? To look for our own maidens. That's big trouble. This seems to be the road leading to the leased territory. Who cares what territory that is. Let's concentrate on the maidens! Let's go! Master Chiu, why are you looking for me? I heard you're going to challenge the lions of the eight countries. Our ancestors have left us something to combat the Powerful Fists. I asked the smith to repair it tonight. I don't know whether it's useful to you or not. A copper lion. Yes. It's made from 100 pounds of pure copper. Look at the craftsmanship in this lion head. It's a work of art. But our students can barely handle it. If it can be useful to you in the competition, please accept this as a gift from our school. Master Chm. Please rise. Fei-hung, this lion head is much heavier than normal lion heads. It's not easy to handle. Yes, but there are benefits. The lions of the foreigners are strong and powerful. It's useless to rely on our kung fu against them. We should destroy them by tactics. I agree with you. I would like to accompany you, Master Wong. Master Chiu! Father! Father. Father, the Red Lanterns are here. The Red Lanterns? Keep calm, listen carefully. We're not safe here. We need to get away. -We need to... find some place. -They are coming. Let's go this way. Come on! Where are you going, you devils? Sister, let's chase down the devils separately. The rest of you, burn the church. -Go chase down the devils! -Yes! It's on fire. On fire? Where's the fire? That should be the east alley. The church of Father Thomas is over there. I need to go see. -Foon! -What's the matter? The Red Lantern maidens are burning and killing. What'll we do? Don't let them find out who we are. Let's leave! Stop! I know you are men posing as women. So you've seen through our disguise. Maidens, castrate them! We're in danger! Run for our lives! Where are you going? -Clubfoot, let's split up. -Who do I go with? This way! Hurry UP! Kill them right here! Wong Fei-hung? Go! Why don't you go? Go now! Oh, he asked us to go. -This way is safe. -This way! 14th Aunt, you'd better not search for Fei-hung with us. You should go now. There's no need to worry about me. Master Chiu, let's split up and search for Fei-hung. Fine! Hurry up! Go over there! Sister, the foreigners are over there. Let's attack them from both sides. -Right. Follow me. -Yes! Father Thomas, are you all right? Heaven have mercy. My child, the Red Lanterns are after us. Run for your life! Go that way! Come on! Hurry! EXPEL THE FOREIGNERS YOU'? Yes, it's me. What bad luck. Father, you are here. It's you. Go over there. Let me fight them. -Go! -Yes, Mistress! Maidens, no massacre, please. They're innocent. If you want to kill, kill me first! Get lost. You have no say here! -Catch them and kill them right here! -Yes! Run! I'll kill the woman. You take the foreigners! Sister, stop! Father! You! Kill the devils! Sister! He saved me once! You liar! You are the betrayer! When Wong Fei-hung came to our hall, I started to suspect you. Now I'm proved right! You're not worthy to hold this banner! Shoot! Mistress! She deserved it. God will punish her. Mistress! Let's go! Get lost. Forget about me. Don't leave me alone! I didn't betray you! Die, you bitch! Let's see your magic now! Mistress! Stop! Help! Fekhung? Take her away! Prepare to fire! You're hurt. Why do you still want to fight? Don't go! Let's move her over there. She's been hurt. She must be cold. Use this to cover her. It's dark. I can't see anything. What a fate. Where is Wong Fei-hung? Fei-hung. Where is he? He's here. You're not him! I would never have believed I would die saving the devils. It's my punishment. I can die in peace now. Wong Fei-hung. At last you've come. Brother Foon, let's go! -Clubfoot! -Brother Foon, the Holy Mother is coming! Brother Clubfoot, save us! Go to hell! Stay where you are! I want to punish you! -Clubfoot, are you all right? -I'm fine. Take aim! The symbol of heresy! Should we save her? How? Look at what we're wearing. If we go out like this, we'll be shot at. I am the goddess Lotus. The spirit resides in me! I am invincible! How dare you offend me! I must punish you on behalf of the gods! I'll send you to hell! Your skin will be ripped off! Your bones will be broken! You bastards! Let's go. Master. You three, stay where you are. Clubfoot? Foon? Yan? Why are you dressed like this? Are you opera actors? You had it coming! Holy Mother! Holy Mother! Don't cry. Tears can't help! Right! Holy Mother hasn't died. She lives in our hearts! Let's take an oath to carry on the mission of killing the foreigners! Kill the foreigners! Kill the foreigners! Kill the foreigners! Kill the foreigners! This prize could hurt us at anytime. If the opposite side uses gunfire, getting the prize is less important than beating their lions! We'll attack them. Yes, Master! Play! The Lion's Roar! Each lion attack a monster! Yes! One Step to the Sky! Stop turning! We can't turn! Magic Turn! I want you to go round and round! Old Master Wong, I can't identify the flag in the front. Forget about the flags. Look at their faces. -Should we fight this one? -No, not this one! Clubfoot, hold this. I'm better off with no lion head! How am I going to handle two lion heads? You're abnormal anyway. They might be afraid of you holding two lion heads! That's it! -It's our turn! -All right! Swinging Lion Tail! Come on! Foon, what are you doing? You should be careful! Tiger Jump! Come on! Why has it gone dark? Where am I? -Who are you? -Big Head Buddha. -What's that? -Let me show you! Some more! You want to shoot? Won't be so easy! Here comes a biscuit! This one is even better. I'll leave it with you! -Let's help Old Master! -Attack! Master Chiu, watch out! Catch the lion's tail! Scared away? Brother Foon, behind you! How dare you scare me! The sun will soon go down behind the Forbidden City. History will be rewritten. We'll see who is going to be the winner. Throw the burning lion heads up here! The prize. Yam! Yam! Get down! I'm shot in the ass! Get me out of here! Don't go! Clubfoot, get over here. Quick! Master, let me send you up there! General! You must leave! We won! General Henlintak! -Hooray! -Hurrah! Long live Germany! The army of the eight nations conquered the scum! Hooray! Long live Germany! -What's happened? -Why are they cheering? Dumb ox. They're cheering for us! Let's go see! I can't see them. Keep going! Yes. Get inside. The army of the eight nations conquered the scum. Hooray! -Fei-hung! -Sir, why are you dressed like that? The allied troops have breached the Forbidden City! The empress dowager has surrendered! Master Wong, let's go. Let's go. Although we won this competition, we lost the country! Henlintak! General, proceed to the celebration. Let us handle Wong Fei-hung. Wait for me! Fekhung! Henlintak! Out of my way! Wong Fei-hung! I'm here! Hurry UP! Stay together! Don't go! Protect the general! What's happening? Henlintak, get down! Lui, protect the general. -Henlintak! -Wong Fei-hung! Master! Let me handle this! Get out! Clubfoot! Take this! Watch out! General! Trying to escape? Want to lock me up? Watch my kick! Clubfoot, I'm going to kill you! Not that easy! Try my Scissors Kick! Henlintak!

Protect the general! | got him! -Trying to escape? -Clubfoot, they have guns! -Fire! -Let's go! Master, do we let them escape? We can't change anything by killing him. Let's go. Master! -Are you badly hurt? -No. Fekhung! Old Master. It's dangerous here. We'd better leave. Dad, let's go back south. Yes. Our capital is occupied. We should go back and prepare to retaliate! Okay. Let's go back south now. Get in! I can't sit down. My ass hurts! Lie down then! Special thanks Joe Cheung Tung-cho and Tung Wai
