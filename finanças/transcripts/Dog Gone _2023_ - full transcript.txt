God. I get tuna every time and I hate tuna. You know I hate tuna, but I just... get it. - It's like... What'd you get? - Italian. See, that... That's a good choice. Italian is a good sandwich. - What's up, babe? - Oh, no. Fields, whatever you do, don't look to your left. Oh, no way. Sorry, pal. Just one week into senior year. How'd she just leave me? Apparently by text. I... I can't eat this. - I feel so alone. - Yeah. "Loneliness and the feeling of being unwanted is the most terrible poverty." Mother Teresa, who, by the way, I guarantee you was never dumped. I mean, seriously, you dump her, that is one-way ticket downstairs. Shh! Is that the guy? Who? - She left me for a Frisbee guy? - You're a Frisbee guy. No, not like him. He's, like... shirtless. He looks great. - Thank you. - Well. I think that tonight, we should go down to the Bobcat, get some drinks, get some wings, forget about Claire and this Adonis. You... Where'd you go? You aren't listening. Let's go to the pound. This is a mistake. Okay, I have love to give, and Claire doesn't want it. I love you, babe. Me, I do. Can we go now, please? I am getting a dog. When was the last time you showered? It was a Tuesday. Listen, dogs, they need shots. They need food and water every day. - Okay? - Yeah. You are just... You're ill-equipped. I'm sorry. You just are. - "What is man without the beasts?" - Oh, no. "For if all the beasts were gone, man would die of a great loneliness of the spirit." - It's Chief Seattle. - I know it's Chief Seattle. I know it is. Just listen. A B-minus in Native American studies does not qualify you to care for an animal. - Also, please don't ever do that again. - Why? It's very off-putting when you quote smart dead guys back at me. That's my thing. Philosophical arts, my thing. - You know it. - Okay. Oh, no. Well, hey! What's up, pup? I love him. And he loves me. Whoop! That's a big bag. All right. Oh, and I need him to imprint on me, so don't, like, bond with him. Done and done. You know what, little buddy? I am gonna find the perfect song for our first car ride together. Why is it so warm in here? I told you, the AC is still broken. - Oh, my God! - Don't scare him. - He's peeing on me! - Whoa! Oh, yeah. - Fields, take your dog right now. - I don't want him! - I don't want him! - Hold on! Take him right now. I swear to God. Listen, I don't want his first five minutes with us to be traumatizing, so just, like, let him do his thing. This is the worst thing that has ever happened. He likes you. Why is there so much? I don't... Yeah. Wow. All right. Maybe we shouldn't look. Oh! Yeah! Okay. Oh, a little bit more. Okay, he's done. Good boy! Good boy. Good boys. Very good boys. Both of you. - I hate you. - You love me. Time to take this fella home. Puppy coming through! Puppy! I got the VIP. Oh, hi! I know. I know. I know. Hi! You having fun, buddy? Oh. You know this is all for you, right? This is your homecoming. This party is fun. I cannot believe that all these people showed up for... What is his name? I don't know. What is your name? He gonked me on the head. - He did what? - I mean... I mean bonked. - Wait, that's it. - What is it? "Gonker." - Hey, yeah, he likes it. Gonker. - What is a gonker? He's a Gonker. Gonker! Gonker! Gonker! Gonker! Gonker! Gonker! Gonker! Gonker! Gonker! Gonker! We're gonna be late to class. Take a deep breath, and we're gonna glide into downward dog. Ready? Go. Go get it. No, come back. Come back. Oh, go get it! Come on. Go, come on. Hey! Whoosh! Yeah, there you go! There you go, buddy! Come here. Yes! That's it, buddy! Bring it back. Boosh! You guys see it? What did I tell you? The boy is talented. I'm not opening a haunted house with you. Wait. Did you guys hear about Lainey? - What? - She got a job at Boeing. Six figures. - No, stop. - Really? - Wow. - Six figures? Like, in money? - Yeah, and she gets to stay in Virginia. - Stop. - I don't know anyone in St. Louis. - What's in St. Louis? - My job. - Yeah. I'm doing PR for Anheuser-Busch. - I start in, like, two weeks. - You didn't know that? - You're working for a beer company? - Dream job, right? Wait, hold on. Do... Do you all have jobs? Uh, yeah, bud, we do. Kinda. We just, uh, didn't... didn't wanna say anything. Well, okay. Wait, hold on now. I'm... I'm not some loser who can't get a job. I just... I don't know what job I can do yet, so I gotta, like, figure that out first, you know? Right. Isn't that kinda what the last four years were for, though? Mmm... - That's my parents. - Yes, it is. - Uh, hide the beers. - Good idea. - Uh, we're 21. - It's 10:30 in the morning. Good point. - Fielding! - Hey, Mom. Hi! - Fielding! - Dad. What... What are you guys doing here? Well, I... I think my investment entitles me to see you in a robe and a funny hat. Well, graduation's tomorrow. Yeah. We told you that we were coming up the day before. Right. Sorry. I forgot about that. I've, um, been busy. Oh. Yeah, I can see that. Well, we have a surprise for you. Oh. Oh, a surprise! Is that Peyton I see? Come here! What? Oh, my God. W-What are you doing here? You know, I took my last exam early so I could fly out and see my bro get his parchment. - Look at you. Best sister ever. - You know. I try. Oh! Whoa, Gonker! Sorry about that. - That's okay. - Whoa, hey! - All right. - Whose dog is this? He's... It's a bad idea. Okay, well, it's not an idea. It's a reality. It's a mistake. He's not a mistake. He's... He's my best friend. You can't even take care of yourself, let alone another living being. Okay, I take care of Gonker just fine. So why's he drinking out of a beer bong? He's not. That's a chemistry thing. Come here, Gonker. Come on, buddy. Come on, let's go. - What kind of a name is "Gonker"? - He gonked me in the head. I see you haven't recovered from the trauma. Look, son, you're about to head out into the real world. You're not gonna have any time to spend with Gonker. What's he gonna do when you're at work all day? "Work"? Dad, come on. Have you called Mr. Kobrenner? Accounting? I suck at math. Or Matt Price at Harper Lewis. Dad, I'm not equipped to handle medical supplies sales. Then what are you gonna do when, in 24 hours, this whole party ends? Other than be back at home with Mom and Dad, exactly where you were four years ago. Come on, boy. Hi. Uh, excuse me, sorry. Hey. Uh, come on. Excuse me, sorry. Sorry. Oh, Mom, Dad. I don't know what to say. Um... It's fine. I'm sure there'll be another ceremony. Oh, wait. There's only one. Fielding, what happened? Well, I really took to heart what Dad said yesterday about how I only had 24 hours left here, so... Uh, Gonk and I slept out by the river 'cause he loves it there. We listened to frogs and talked about the stars. - You talked? - And we played flashlight chase. - He likes to chase a light on the ground. - We can do the math. Right. And we must have fallen asleep pretty late, 'cause, um, I overslept. Well, I'm sure it's worth the six-hour round trip just to see 4,000 strangers all dressed in the same outfit. It's okay. We can still go out for a celebratory meal, right? Actually, Mom, I, um... My stomach's been feeling a little off the past few days. Uh, maybe we can rain check? Sure. Yeah, we'll have plenty of time for family meals back home. It's all right. I, uh... It's okay. Accidents happen. I'm really proud of you. - And I love you. - I love you too. Well, congratulations on graduating. Drive safe. Thanks. And, again, I'm so sorry. Um... I'll see you tomorrow. Um, no, I'm going back to Seattle tonight. What? Wait, just you, you... You cannot leave me alone with them. I got a summer job in the Creative Writing department. Look, you say you don't wanna live with the 'rents, then why don't you get a job and go pay rent?

Hey. - He wants to kiss you. - That's so nice. Here you go, sport. Uh, what's this? Shock collar. Oh, no, he's... He's not wearing this. - Mom, he's a wild beast. - He's a domesticated animal. Let's not go that far. You saw the frat house. No, I'm serious. He's used to being free. He ran around campus all the time. We're not on campus anymore. We're in civilization. And in civilization, people keep their refrigerators in their kitchen and their dogs in the yard. No, I... So we have some sensors set up outside right by the woods, so he can get close, but not too close. And if he does, he gets a little zap. Not enough to hurt him, just enough to teach him. - It's gonna break his spirit. - It goes on his neck, not his spirit. What are... What is it, buddy? No, no, no! Gonker! - Hey! Hey! Gonker!

You go get that fox! They told me it would stop any dog. Well, Gonker isn't any dog. What if he gets lost? No, Mom, he'd run around campus for hours. He always came back. - But he doesn't know his way around here. - He'll be fine. I promise. No, he's a really, really special dog. A bit of Japan that I can leave behind. For your family's hospitality during our visit. He's yours now. His name is Oji. I love him. Can I play with him? Fifty meters in either direction. We need to go to town soon. I don't want to have to look for you. Come on, Oji. Come on, boy. - Want some food? - Uh, no, I'm fine, but I could use a nap. - What? - Oh, God. Son? Son! - Oh, hey. I'm sorry. Did I wake you? - I think you woke your Aunt Jenny. - She's been dead for nine years. - What are you doing? Oh, it's a breathing technique. A modified Agni Prasana. It's... We time it to the end of our sleep cycle. Keeps me centered, stabilizes my gut. What's his deal? Uh... Oh, he likes to do it with me. Or maybe he just wants a belly rub? Don't look at me, pal. Okay, bye. So our assessment is that any positive movement in the next quarter is gonna be unlikely. So you're holding off on investments until when? No. My team's telling me you should keep your powder dry, at least until the local elections or maybe after the rainy season. Implementing a program is gonna be possible at some point, right? Can you excuse me for one second? - I'm so sorry. - Uh, sure. Fielding! Yes, sir? I'm on a Zoom call with five people. He's just sitting here whining. He wants to play fetch. All right. Go get it. He needs to choose the stick. He needs to choose it? Yeah, it changes every day. Now what? He wants you to watch him choose. It's no fun if you don't watch. Hey. I'm watching. Oh!

Worst-named dog in the world. Gonker? What are you doing? Hmm? Oh. You're scared of the thunder and lightning. Aren't you? Yeah. Just like Fielding when he was little.

You want me to get the mop? No, it's Gonker. He didn't greet me when I came in. And now there's food on the floor and he's not touching it? He didn't eat his breakfast? I think that's his dinner from last night. Hey, boy, you wanna go for a run? No? Hey, come on! Come on, let's go play! - Mom? - I'll call the vet. Hey. It's okay. Addison's disease is when the body fails to produce enough glucocorticoids. You fall into adrenal insufficiency, which causes pain, low blood pressure. You can lapse into a coma. Wait. He's in a coma? Oh, no, he's sedated. Now, with medication, Addison's can be controlled, but Gonker's condition had laid dormant his entire life. And he's had an acute episode. He's not out of the woods yet. And if he survives, he's going to need a shot every 30 days. If he survives? I'm sorry, but it's 50/50 he makes it through the night. Um... Then I'm gonna stay with him. Not a good idea. He's gonna lapse in and out of consciousness. And if he sees you, it'll rile him up, and he needs sleep. Best thing for both of you is rest. My staff and I will be with him around the clock. I promise. Here. Now Gonker can have some nice clean bowls when he gets back. Yeah, if he gets back. Don't talk like that. Well, they said online it's worse the longer it goes untreated. He spent the whole first year of his life with no medication, nothing. In college, did you ever notice him getting worn out or anything? Well, some days, but I thought he was tired from, you know, playing fetch or hiking. This is what we were saying. Having a dog is a responsibility. When you care for someone, it can't just be sometimes or playtime. It has to be all the time. He's been like this since 6:00 a.m. Never seen a rebound like this in any dog.

The summer that we went to Mohonk, New York. Ugh. I fished every day in the lake for two weeks. I got nothing but a sunburn. How do you do that? Oh, hey. There he is. The stinky foul beast, and he brought his dog. Oh! John... Oh, you remember the Goodwins, Fielding? - Yes! Hi. - Good to see you again. You were out for a long time. Yeah, we stopped at Mr. Platt's so Gonk could play with Yuri. It's good for him to play with other dogs. - Yeah. Well, can I make you a plate? - Uh, o, thank you. You never eat. He's preparing for a life of poverty. - Oh! I got him. - Hey! Hey! - That's mine. - He loves pie. We're gonna do some yoga before I hit the shower, so... - It was great seeing you guys. - Come back and eat, okay? - You tease him too much. - I'm just having fun with him. Must be nice to have him home. Mmm. Yes and no. Look... I was broke in college. I worked my way through with three jobs. And when I graduated, I had employment. You know, and when my father was 21, he'd served in a war. Yeah, but he just hasn't found his path yet. Yeah, well, he better, 'cause I will not be Tim Misner. His son's 35 years old and just moved back into the house with them. It's what keeps me up at night. My class isn't boring, and the last question that I asked on the test was, "Is atheism a religion?" - Oh. - I know. Like, how do you answer that? You can't. It's not a thing. So, I just gave everybody an "A" and watched The Office. Nice. You know, the thought of you teaching undergrads, it's kind of terrifying. - I know. - Terrifies me. Check that out. A fox. You see the fox? Go get the fox! - Zoom! - There he goes. See fox, chase fox. Why can't my life be as simple as Gonker's? I know, right? It's good to see you. Thank you for driving up. Yeah. You sounded pretty down on the phone. Your dad's just kidding. I mean, you know that. Mmm... Nah. Like, I always knew he was disappointed in me, but this time... - I don't know, he just seemed embarrassed. - He's not. He's not embarrassed. He's not. He's just... your dad. He just doesn't get it. Like, I'm very well aware of how lucky I am. - Right? - I am. You know, to have two parents who busted their asses to send me to school. - Yes, they did. - And gave me every opportunity. Like, I'm just trying to figure out what to do with that. What does that mean? It's hard to find a career when you're not good at anything. You are good at stuff. - Okay. - Yes, you are. It's not like I can get paid for kayaking. - You might be able to. - Gonker! Come here! Gonker! He ran fast. Gonker! Gonky buddy, ya hiding? Gonker! Gonker! Gonk! Gonker! Gonk! Gonker! Gonker! Gonker! Gonker! Mom! Dad! He's gone! - What? Who's gone? - Gonker. - What happened to your face? - I fell down a ravine looking for him. - Where? - The Appalachian Trail. He went after a fox and he never came back. Nate and I, we were looking everywhere for him. - He's somewhere out there right now. - There are coyotes out there. - They're gonna eat him alive. - That's not helpful. This is why I told you to use a leash! I knew this would happen! - When was the last time he had his shot? - Ten days ago. So he's got 20 days tops. Fielding, what is wrong with you? This is what we're gonna do. First of all, we're gonna realize that we're not gonna find him tonight. Right? You're gonna take a deep breath, we're gonna clean out this cut and we're gonna plan something in the morning. Mom. Please. It's so cold out. He's fine. He has a fur coat. I don't have a fur coat. He's been out there for hours. I am not letting that bear of a dog inside while I entertain. Now go to your room and be quiet or you'll find yourself outside with him. Come on, boy. Come on, let's go. Nice and warm. You're my best friend, Oji. It's insane. A 2,200-mile trail and the parks department only has two rangers assigned to it. What's going on? Oh, the library gave us phone books for every county in Virginia. - At least I think it's every one. - Why? Because I'm analog. And if I search online, I'm just gonna print it all out anyway. That's hundreds of loose pages. This way, it's easier to manage. No, why are you doing this? Because we have to find Gonker. So we should start with pounds, obviously. - Animal hospitals. - Yeah. Right. And let's do Rockbridge, Rockingham. - And Augusta. - Okay. Also, every town, we should talk to the police department. - Yes. - Talk to animal control. We should talk to, uh, churches. Anywhere people congregate and go for information. Yeah, local newspapers. - VFW halls. - Yes. Rotary Clubs, Elk Lodges. You're talking hundreds of places. Yeah. You have a better idea? No. Well, there's no other alternative. I'm gonna stay here and I'll work the phones, take out ads. Ads? Don't you think social media is more effective? I don't do that stuff. That's your department. And search and rescue. Your mom's gonna hold down the command center here, but you and I are hitting the Appalachian Trail. So if we focus, we work hard, and make calculated, deliberate decisions, and I promise you, we will find that dog. Right? Hurry up, get dressed. We only have so much daylight. Okay. You promise? How can you say that? Because I believe it. It's been over an hour driving. Should I be prepared for it to be this quiet the whole time? I'm checking to see if Gonker's word is getting out. How's it going? Just friends saying they hope we find him, but nothing useful. Can we play something with a little more pep? I'm not feeling peppy. This whole thing's my fault. Thanks for doing this. We haven't accomplished anything yet. Caesar never thanked his generals until they delivered a victory. I'm not Caesar. No, you're not. But you're trying to solve this situation. That's a start. If you want to find him, you need to find him. Have you found Jesus Christ? Well, we're a member of the church. We probably don't go as often as we should. - You're selling those? - Best in the county. I've got the perfect one for ya. Saint Anthony is the patron saint of lost souls. He'll help bring Gonker's soul back to you. Let us pray. Saint Anthony, guide these men as they search for their beloved hound. Amen. Amen. Um, well, here's a ten. Five for the figurine and five for the prayer. Appreciate you. Same to you, brother. Can't hurt. And his collar is blue and white herringbone. I'm real sorry, but none of our dogs match that description. Okay. Well, maybe could you just put up a flyer in the office? Can do. And I'll make a bunch of copies and have our shelter volunteers pass them out around town. Jerry Malcolm. Thank you so much. We're so appreciative of your kindness. - You have a great day. - You too. - Good luck, now. - Thank you. Gonker! Gonker! Gonker! Gonker! Gonker! Dad, Dad, you're not a French ambulance. Oh, I'm sorry. I would hate for me to embarrass you. - At least you admit it. - Admit what? - That you're embarrassed of me. - Don't be ridiculous. Am I being ridiculous? Because what's the opposite of embarrassment? It's pride. So, can you say you're proud of how I live my life? You know, from my ripped jeans to my choices and everything in between. Well, Fielding, obviously, there are decisions that you've made, how you spent your time in college, how you're spending your time now, that I don't... I don't agree with. - And, frankly, I don't understand them... - I guess we're just two different people. - Let me finish what I'm saying. - There's no point, you know? 'Cause I know that you think that I'm irresponsible, and immature, and, you know, Gonker's gonna die 'cause of me. - Fielding. - There's hikers coming. Um, hi! Excuse me. I'm looking for my dog. Just wondering if you've seen him. Or maybe you can help spread the word if not. Yes, hi. This is Ginny Marshall. I just emailed you a note with a flyer explaining my family's situation and... That's call waiting. I'll try you back. - John? - Ms. Marshall. This is Kyle Gans at the Virginia Sun. I got your email. Oh! Thank you for calling back so quickly, Mr. Gans. Yes. Um... I was wondering if we could put a, um, a lost dog ad in your paper. I'd be happy to reimburse you for any expenses. Actually, I'm thinking of something bigger. I was struck by what you wrote. It was deeply personal. You're clearly heartbroken over your dog. Oh, well, yeah, I... I did write the note, but, actually, Gonker belongs to my son. Really? Because it reads like you lost your dog. Anyway, with your permission, I'd like to write an article about your search. What? We're getting publicity. - The newspaper's gonna run an article. - An article? Really? With a photo of Gonker and everything. The Connor boys are here, they're setting up a scanner for me, 'cause the newspaper said we need a certain resolution or something. I don't know. I called Janie and she sent 'em right over. Great. Make sure you give 'em both a 20. Yeah, I already tried. They refused. Isn't this wonderful? The Virginia Sun has a circulation of, like, 6,000. I mean, Gonker has been retweeted double that. We still haven't heard anything. Well, every little bit counts, right? All right. Well, keep up the good work. We love you. We'll call you from the road in the morning. Okay. Love you too. We did 14 miles today. I need you to keep up your energy. - I know you're upset, but... - I'm not upset, Dad. It's... It's what? All my friends, okay, they've all gone and started their lives, and I'm happy for them. But it's like they pity me. I totally feel it. And you and Mom, you guys judge me too. - Fielding, your mom and I don't judge you. - Dad, yes, you do. Every day. In how you look at me. How you talk about me when you think I can't hear you. And when all of your friends, and your mom, and your dad, and their friends, when everyone looks at you like you're a loser, it's... It's nice to have one soul on earth who thinks you're fine just the way you are. Even if you are a little bit different or don't have a job, or direction, or momentum. Just one soul who loves you because... Because you are you. That's who Gonker was for me, Dad. Gonker was the only one on the entire planet who... Who liked me just the way I am. Son, you're worried about Gonker because you love him and he's lost. That's why I worry about you. You just did it again. Just because I'm trying to find my way or whatever doesn't mean I'm lost. Excuse me! Excuse me! Hi. Hi. Hi, um, were you handing these out in the Hardee's earlier? Yeah. Have you seen him? Uh, no, sweetie, I haven't, but when my Tucker ran off a few years ago, we went around with his brother Butchie, and Tucker picked up his scent real fast. Some folks think dogs will pick up the scent of another canine before they will a human scent. It's kinda left over from when they needed to find their packs. I thought maybe it could help. Thank you. - Hey, we really appreciate this. - Ah, you kiddin'? Yuri loves Gonker, and vice versa. No doubt old Gonk will know his scent. I promise he'll never be off leash, and we'll feed him well, get plenty of exercise. Fresh air will do him good. Need him back a week from today. Heading to Florida till the spring. You got it. Hopefully, we'll be back with two dogs. All right. You be good, Yuri. Help the Marshalls find their boy. Gonk! Gonker! Gonker! Gonker! Gonk! - Hey, excuse me. - Hey, how are ya? We're looking for our dog. Maybe you can help us. - Seen anything around here? - No, haven't seen anything. - Thank you so much. - Good luck. Gonker! Gonker! Gonker! Gonker! Gonker! Gonker! I'd love to help. I have a friend at the high school, lets me make copies for free. I can put one up at the church, the market. Oh, and the quarry employs a whole lot of folk. I'll make sure they find one on their windshield after work. - Thank you. You're a godsend. - Tell my ex that. Good luck. What about those guys? - Are you sure? - Talk about covering a lot of ground. Right. They're on motorcycles. They can't ride the trail. We don't know if Gonker's gonna stay on the trail. - He could head into a city. - Okay. But they just don't look like the type of people you approach about this kind of thing. Son, if you live in a bubble, eventually you suffocate. Pardon the interruption. I was wondering if any of you gentlemen had, uh, possibly seen our missing dog on your travels? He disappeared two days ago on the trail, um, and if we don't find him within 18 days and give him his medicine, he could die. His name is Gonker. - His name is "Gonkers"? - "Gonker." Singular. It's one dog. Gon-ker. That's a stupid name. I gave my dog a stupid name once. "Macaroni." Yeah. He was five when he got out of the yard. Never came back. I still dream about him. What happened to your guy? How'd he get lost? Um... I had him off the leash, so... Uh, it's my fault. You need to forgive yourself. I beat myself up for years on account of Macaroni. It does you no good. And it does no good for Gonkers either. Gonker. We've got chapters up and down the coast. And we'll make sure that every Asrael's Knight keeps their eyes peeled. - Oh. - Thank you. And thank all the other knights. Uh, yeah, thanks. No dogs. Next motel is over 30 miles away, and their website says, "No pets over 15 pounds." All right, let's put his bowls in your bag. No, they said, "No dogs." Yeah. Little laws are for little men. - The fine is, like, $300. - Come on. Ancient trading caravans on the Silk Road would stop at campgrounds on their way to the Orient. You know what they called those? Holiday Inns that don't allow dogs? "Caravansaries." Not only were there camels allowed inside, the guards would welcome them and protect them. - Oh. - We are a caravansary. So they are required to welcome our camp. Come on. Okay. Put the coat around me. - What is this, Scooby-Doo? - Come on, come on! He's heavy. Okay, I'm gonna distract the front desk while you slip by, and I'll meet you at the elevators. Let's light this candle. I am not paying the fine. Of course not. You'd need money for that. Hello. Your dog is with a bad man. Who is this? My neighbor Claude got him. He got all kinds of animals. Lord knows what he does to them. I see lots of dogs get brought in, but I ain't ever seen one come out. I don't understand. She says this guy's harming animals? That's what she said. We should call the police. And tell them what? They can't enter the guy's house on an accusation. They'd need probable cause for a warrant and there's not enough to get one. Intro to Constitutional Law, B-plus. Look, we'll have a conversation with the guy and we'll see what's what. - Do we have an address? - I just texted it to Fielding. Oh, also, Fields, um, I need you to get the word out on my new Twitter and Instagram handles. Hey, you guys be careful at this Claude fella's. He might be some kinda serial killer. Yeah, you're absolutely right. That's why I'm gonna send Fielding to the front door. Great. Be safe. I'm serious. Bye. All my paperwork's up-to-date. I'm fully licensed to act as a non-profit, temporary shelter for strays. I'm sorry. My wife called me and said I should check it out. I don't know. It's... No, this isn't the first time it's happened. The woman who called, Mrs. Banner, 98 and, uh, losing her faculties. It's been explained to her a dozen times what we do, but she just forgets. - But her heart's in the right place. - Sure. - Listen, we're sorry to take up your time. - You're not taking up my time. Look, I'm fully plugged in to the animal rescue community. I'm gonna scan this, okay? I'm gonna get a chain going. We have folks, they spend every weekend searching for strays just to try and help. They need to know about Gonker. Well, thank you. Yeah, thanks. You okay? Oh, yeah, I just... I was hoping he'd be here, but... Let's just hope for a miracle. - Ah, good! You got some calories in you. - Mmm. Mmm-hmm! Um... So, I was thinking today we make our way down to Elkton. Elkton. - That's quite a ways. - Well, we don't have a choice. It's like we say, Gonker isn't any dog. As hard as you're searching for him, he's searching for you. Hi. Um, so sorry to bother you. I was wondering, maybe, if you've seen this dog? Well, we sure have, 'cause he's our dog. Hold on. You're the Marshalls? That's what the mailbox says. And you are? Um, Tracy. I can't believe this. I just read about you guys yesterday, and it just made me feel so sad. So I made a bunch of these to hand out while I hike. That is incredibly nice of you. Wow, I guess the Virginia Sun did us a solid. The Sun? No, I've read about this in Roanoke Times. - Can I see that flyer? - Yeah, of course. Ha! This is from the Associated Press. Gonker's gone national. - Hello, this is Ginny Marshall. - Ginny, my name is Alex Olsen. I saw the article about your dog in the Duluth News Tribune. I got a Saint Bernard with Addison's disease. I just wanted to let you know there's certain foods that you can leave out for Gonker, that if he can get to 'em, which might help his condition. Give him a few extra days before his medicine wears off. Hello, this is Ginny Marshall. Uh, can you just say that one more time? Rhodesian. Rhodesian Ridgeback. They are excellent trackers. But when he goes out to hunt, I have a method to help him find his way home. Take anything you might have with your son's scent on it. Place it outside. The scent can carry for up to ten miles. I can't keep up with all the calls. People are reaching out from all over the world with tips on how to track him, how to lure him out of the woods, how to help him find your scent. Well, I don't think they're gonna need help with that. Meaning? You're working on kind of a... patchouli musk. - Have you smelled your cologne? - Aw. - Sounds like you two are getting along. - Oh, no, it's Stockholm syndrome. Anyway, I put everyone's tips together in a Google doc, and I just shared it with you. I sent you a link. I recognize your voice, but you cannot possibly be my mom. Ha-ha. Very funny. Gonker! Gonker! - Man, this is beautiful country. - Oh, I know. I took the youth center kids on the trail a few times. Like, to a stream. Kayaked all day. - They loved it. - Sounds like you did too. Yeah. So you... You might think this is, like, dumb or whatever, but, um... I was thinking about maybe one day working in that field. Doing what? Uh, you know, like, outdoor tours, nature tours, stuff like that. Is there a living in that? I don't know. Just a thought. Ow. Hey! Hey, you okay? Oh, yeah, it's just some blisters. Look, we're a half mile from a rest stop. Why don't we take a break? No, we should keep going. He's only got two weeks. All the more reason you gotta stay healthy. We've got a lot of ground to cover. Come on. Hey. We should definitely check in with those guys. Yeah, I have flyers, and I can recite the story in my sleep, so... Are you coming? Thought I'd let you handle it. Look like your kind of people. If you live in a bubble, you eventually suffocate. Now he listens to me. You're gonna hyperventilate. See, you got the wrong stuff in there. If the kindling bends like this, it's too wet. Unless it breaks, it doesn't burn. So you need more stuff like this. See, now... - Yeah, that's kindling. - Wow. - You're, like, full of dad knowledge. - Ha! I don't know about that. Talk to my son, he'll tell you I'm full of something. - He's pretty awesome. - Fielding? Yeah, man. Going out on the open road, searching for his best friend. He's got a real loving energy that's hard to come by. It's like you two are on, like, an epic journey together. Like a quest. - An epic quest. - Yo. A vision quest, like the movie. Matthew Modine, Madonna, singing in a Pennsylvania Appalachian bar? No? That's what makes what you're doing so cool. Not many dads would walk the trail for their kid. Yeah. I mean, my old man, he thinks everything I do is stupid, like writing my music, or making my plays. No, he doesn't think you're stupid. He loves you. Writing your plays and making your music isn't gonna pay the bills. You know, or get you health care coverage, so he worries. That's what dads do, they... We worry. Mr. Marshall, we were all born in 2000. The first humans of the new millennium. With technological advances, the odds are greater we'll live past 100 than die before 40. So what's the difference if on our deathbed, we had 54 years in the workforce or 53? If we die with a little less money to leave our kids but a lot more life experience and knowledge to pass on? Some people know exactly what they want. And others don't, like me and my friends. At the end of the day, we're all just walking the trail. It's just some of us wanna wait a bit longer before we step off. That's all. You know, I think my son's been trying to tell me his version of that, like, half a dozen times, and... Don't know why I didn't hear it until now. 'Cause I'm not your son. All right. This was a good day. Just another day with no dog to show for it. Well, people who don't even know us now know Gonker. And the dog can only travel so far, and the story is now outpacing him. So it's a good thing. Believe me. Really? Again? Really? All right. This is why I haven't been able to get much rest. I'm so used to Gonker being in bed with me, I can't sleep without him. - Yeah, Well, you're welcome to this one. - Oh, no, I think he likes you. He just won't stop moving. Can you stop? See if we can pull this off. Remember, today was a good day. It's okay, boy. I'm okay. Oh! Thanks for all your help, Yuri. - So you have enough water? - Yep. - Food? - PowerBars and beef jerky. - You actually gonna eat any of it? - Yes. Good. 'Cause take this in the spirit with which it's intended, but you look like a bag of crap. - Thank you very much. - So you'll take Spotswood up to... - To the main trail. - That's right. - And I'll meet you in the parking lot at... - Browns Gap. Got it. It should take you about ten hours of walking, and I'll see you tonight. - Be safe. - I'll be fine. Promise. See ya. Be good. Oji? Oji? Oji? Where's Oji? I need you to be a big girl about this. Oji got loose this morning and ran into Fulton. He was struck by a car. He didn't make it. I'm sorry. I know you liked him, but these things are a part of life. Now, I told your father you would likely make a big thing about this. Prove me wrong. Show us that you won't carry on and you will be rewarded with a day of shopping at Josie's Boutique. 'Cause the truth is, no amount of crying will bring him back. So why waste that energy, okay? - Oh. - Ooh. Oh, gosh, you scared me. I missed you. - I missed you too. What a week. - Mmm-hmm. So Yuri's back with Earl, and I am so looking forward to a shower with a regular-sized bar of soap. Ugh, I bet. I don't think I've seen a room like this since Russell Crowe was doing math. Yeah, I've been listening to a podcast of the Bushmen in the Kalahari and how they track antelope, and I was thinking there could be something to that that's applicable here. - Sure. - Yeah. And also I've been putting up trackers where everybody said that they've seen Oji, but the description was wrong, but I figure maybe if there's a pattern to his movements, we should follow up. Because who knows, maybe every tipster just described him wrong. Yeah, no, that makes sense. Yeah, and then there's one other thing. And you're gonna think I'm crazy. - Animal psychics. - Okay. - What? - No, I'm worried about you. I'm fine! There's just a lot of information coming in, and I'm trying to control it all. - He's not Oji. - I'm just trying to... - What? - Gonker is not Oji. I know that. This has nothing to do with Oji. You have to stop putting pressure on yourself. It's... It's just that it's happening all over again. I promised myself that I would never care about another dog again, and then here I am. Heartbroken again. Look, look, look, I... I promise you it won't happen again. We're gonna find this dog. - You keep saying that. - I know. Because I believe it. Hey, it's Fielding. Sorry I missed your call. Leave a message. Look, I am officially beyond worried to extremely concerned. You were supposed to be here 40 minutes ago. I'm gonna go to some of the other trailheads. If you end up here, stay put because I'll be back. - Why wouldn't he be answering? - Reception's spotty on the trail. He could have a dead battery or... Or what? The kid is skin and bones. He hasn't eaten. He's not sleeping. It's dark. He's tired. I hope he didn't hurt himself. I've been up and down this trail. He's over two hours late. - You should have called me sooner! - Well, I didn't wanna worry you. Oh, yeah? How's that working out for ya? We've already lost a dog in these damn woods. And now our son too? Hang on. I found him! I'll call you back. Fielding. Where were you? I was looking for my dog. Come on. - Watch the heel. - I got you. Ready? Oh, look at this. Okay. Well, twenty-four miles in 12 hours on unpaved roads, uphill, downhill. - You're pushing yourself to the brink. - I had to cover more ground. Gonker needs me. Remember the other day you were asking me if I was proud of how you were living your life? Your clothes, your choices? - Hey, Dad... - You didn't let me answer. - We're cool. We don't have to do all that. - Hey, hey, hey! Hey, no. Will you listen for a minute, okay? Please. I can't take pride in your clothes. Okay? I can't take pride in living in a cabin or any of those kind of things because they're just that, they're things. That's not what fathers take pride in. I take pride in your character. The character that embraces being kind to everyone. It's fun. It's funny. Loving. The kind of character that rescues a puppy from a shelter and gives it a home. The kind of character that would walk all night on bloody feet before it would give up on someone it loves. So, you're asking me if I'm proud of you. I have always been proud of you. I wouldn't know how not to be. I love you, Dad. I love you too. Twenty-four miles? That's insane. That's what I told him. But he's not listening. He's dedicated. And you? Fielding's my compass now. Wherever he says we go, we go. Be safe. I love you. Love you. Almost out of kibble. We'll pick some up at town. It's starting to get dark. What if he comes back to the trail at night and we're not here to find him? The experts were telling your mom if he's anywhere nearby, he's gonna pick up your scent. I just... I don't think we've been anywhere nearby. - Don't give up hope. - It's getting hard not to. Gonker! Hello? Who's looking for Gonker? I am! Fielding? - Nate? - Hey, man! Ow! Oh, God. Ow. Ow. What are you doing off the trail, man? You could get lost, you could get killed. I know! I almost did right there. Listen. Wasn't my intention. I'm not real good at following all these markers. They should make real signs, you know? Something that says, "Trail that way." Dude, what are you doing out here? Looking for our dog. You said that you guys started north. I started south, worked my way up. Got my walking stick on account of all the walking. Got some donuts 'cause I thought Gonk might smell them. Interesting thing about donuts. You know who else loves donuts? Every freaking bird in the state of Virginia, because I have been mauled and pecked at and attacked, and it's... No, I mean, what are you doing out here? This is my fault. I'm the one who pointed out the fox to Gonker, so this is my fault. I'm sorry, man. I didn't mean to. You know that I loved him. - I know that you loved him, and we just... - Nate. I never once, for a second, ever thought to blame you. Like, ever. Wish I would have known that, because these crows have been kicking my ass. All right. I got an idea. - Where's he going? - Dude, I don't know. - God, it's so good to see you. - Don't touch me, man. I know you love me. Oh, my God. Mmm. Mmm. Oh, my God. So good. Mmm! Oh, my God. Did they not feed you at the psych department, Nate? It's more of a food for the soul kind of group, you know? I'm thinking about selling out, going to Wall Street. Wow! Yeah? What about becoming a "philosophical artist"? "I love capitalism." "It rewards me for being brave, and it awards me for being innovative and thinking outside the box." Henry Rollins. And he was a philosophical artist. Maybe I'll become an organic farmer or something. - I don't know. Weighing both options. - You're strange, Nate. And I love it. All right, I'm gonna go hit the head. Papa seems like he's in a fine mood tonight. How you guys getting along, all this time together? Um... Good. Really good. Yeah, I think we found our rhythm. - Can I clear these? - Yes, thank you. Uh, yeah, thank you. - You didn't go near your burger. - I know. Thank you. What's up with that? Just don't bring that up in front of my dad. Okay. It's just my stomach's been upset. It was messed up last semester of school. Fields, you gotta get that checked. It could be who knows what? - Another beer? - None for me, thank you. I am driving. I'll have another water when you get a chance. Um, also if there's any way you could hang this up by the door, maybe on that board. Otherwise, I totally understand. It's fine. Your dog's lost? Oh, my goodness! He's so cute! - No worries. I'll do it myself. - Thank you. Really. "Nothing for me. I'm driving." ♪ I'm Little Bo-Peep and I lost my puppy ♪ I'm sorry, is this high school? Just ignore it. ♪ Where, oh, where Has my little dog gone? ♪ ♪ Where, oh, where could he be? ♪ You spoiled college guys go on the trail. You don't know what the hell you're doing. That's why you lost your stupid dog. Hey, I've had a hell of a week and a half. Uh... - So if you two idiots could shut up? - Don't... Okay. Oh, my God. - You got something to say? - Mmm-mmm. Say it to my face. Oh, no, I already had to hear you. Now you want me to look at you too? Oh, my God! Shut up! Whoa, whoa, whoa. I wasn't aware there was dancing at this establishment. - Doesn't concern you, Pops. - Ha! Yeah, well, that's where you're wrong. See, this is my son. - Dad. - And that is his friend. So it is my biological edict to protect 'em. What do you think you're gonna do about it? Well, that's a fair question. You see, I think for a living. Anywhere there's a problem around the world, I look at the facts on the ground, and then I make what's called a "predictive assumption." And here's my assessment of the facts right now. That you've had a couple drinks, you're looking to have a fight. These two are not. So now you're thinking maybe you'll take a run at me. - 100%. - Yeah, well. Here's what's gonna happen. I'm gonna take my thumb and jam it so far into your eye socket it could pop it out like a cork. So now it's your turn to think, is it worth the risk? Because if it's not, then you better back off. Y'all ain't worth the hassle. The cheeseburger was fantastic. He's Dwayne Johnson in Dockers. They found him! A yellow lab mix was brought into a shelter really weak. Blood tests show he has Addison's disease. All right, here we go! You okay? Yeah. Just wanna get my dog. We will have him soon enough. We had heard about Gonker on the news. And when the vet said he had Addison's, oh, we were so excited to call you guys. Here. It's not him. I don't... I don't understand. It looks just like the dog on the flyer. He's a little smaller and has reddish fur. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, Fielding. I'm so sorry, Gonker. No. Oh, no. Dad, what are we doing? We have to keep looking. Say hello to your mother. - You look terrible! - We can't give up. He's gonna die out there. - Honey, odds are he's already gone. - Don't say that. - I found your sandwich. You didn't eat it. - I don't care about that. Fielding, we have had over a hundred people trying to find Gonker, and he still hasn't turned up. You're not sleeping, and you're not eating, and the stress is taking its toll on you. We need to keep looking. It's over, baby. He was the best friend I ever had. I know. I know exactly how you feel. - Hi. - Hey. Um, Mom and Dad filled me in. How you holding up? I'm not. You did everything you could, Fields. All I could would mean I'm still out there. You're sick. As hard as it may be, you need to take a step back. Gonker didn't make me like this. I've been feeling sick for a few months now. Something's wrong, Peyton. Every time I eat, it's excruciating pain. I'm coughing up blood. Anything other than water makes me hurt. I thought it was just an upset stomach at first, but a few weeks ago, it got really bad. Peyton, I feel like I'm dying. Why didn't you tell anyone? 'Cause I had to keep looking. Okay, no, listen to me. Either you go down that hallway and tell Mom and Dad what's going on or I will. Mom. Dad. There's something I need to tell you. - It's the Marshalls. - Is everything okay? - The machine will get it. - This is Matt Kessler. I'm pretty sure your dog's here at the Evergreen Lodge in Nellysford. - Hi, this is Ginny Marshall. - Hi, Miss Marshall. Yeah, we've got a dog that's been eating out of our garbage for the past day or so, and we haven't been able to coax him inside to check out his tags. He's pretty skittish. But he looks just like the dog in the flyer. Do you happen to have a video of the dog? I just ask because several people have said that they've seen Gonker and they've been mistaken. I tried to record him doing his little tricks... Excuse me, what kind of tricks, exactly? It was the darnedest thing. He found a box of stale donuts, and the son of a gun was flipping them up in the air with his nose. I don't know. You really think he could have made it here in his condition? One hundred and eleven miles? Gonker isn't any dog. - John. - Yes. - Fielding. - Hi. - Thank you for calling. - Yeah, thank you. Uh, so this is where you've seen him? Yeah, he eats right here at the dumpster. Usually hangs around that tree line, comes out whenever food is thrown away. Gonker! Gonker! Gonker! When was the last time you saw him? Three hours ago. I called you right after. He got spooked 'cause the dumpster lid came down with a crash and he tore into the woods. Hope that didn't chase him off for good. Gonker! If he was here, he would've heard me. We will find that dog. Why won't you stop saying that? Because I believe it. Gonker. Gonker! Madam, your dog has returned. Goodbye, Oji. Hello, Gonker! Hi. Fielding! Erratic breathing, semi-thready pulse. - What are we dealing with? Heroin? Oxy? - No, no drugs. He hasn't been eating. Okay, we got it from here. Hang a bag, normal saline. Give me a full blood panel and stat EKG. You got it, doctor. It was one of the worst cases I'd ever seen. We did have to remove the bulk of his large intestine. You know, he could have died. - From ulcerative colitis? - Yeah. Sure, if remained untreated long enough. But just so you know, he's okay. From what I saw in surgery, he spent weeks in acute pain and distress. Any reason why he would have waited so long to seek medical care? It's gonna sound crazy. He... His dog was lost. He wanted to keep looking. Yeah, well. Hansel and Gretel on their birthday, so I get it. - When can we see him? - Give him a couple of hours. He and his dog are gonna have many more birthdays. Thank you so much. Thank you. Hey, if Hansel and Gretel ever go missing, look us up. - Sounds good. Thank you. - Thank you. Oh, my gosh! And here he is, chewing on his favorite pillow. And then, look, this is his favorite stick. Every single time, he gets that one. And the vet is shocked at how strong he is. Except for a few sores on his paws, he's gonna be fine. He looks sad. Because he's wondering where his buddy went. Well, if it isn't the Marshall family pet detectives. - Hi, doc. - Hi. How are we doing today? Uh... I want to go home. Gonker looks miserable without me. Well, he's gonna continue missing you if you don't get some rest. The nurse said you've been tossing and turning all night. The body heals when it sleeps. Yeah, he doesn't sleep well without his dog. Well, do the best you can. Your body needs it. Like, really needs it. Okay? - Yeah, okay. - Great. You need to relax. Yuri was much better at this than you are. Stick your head inside the jacket. Inside the jacket. - We're gonna get in so much trouble. - No, I know. Come on. Hey, what are you guys doing here? We brought you a sleep aid. Gonker? - Oh, my God. - Good boy. Hey! Hey, boy! Hey, buddy. Hi. You're so tired. Yeah. You wanna go to sleep?
