(gentle music) Hello, Bill. [Bill] Hey. Robert, who is this man? Excuse me. Should I send Robert's lunch back to the kitchen, Doctor? You can set it down. We'll be through in a moment. Let's continue, Robert. Who is this man? Robert. (gentle music) Who is this man? (gentle music) He is a rich man. We know that. How is he related to you? Ezekiel said you can throw away your money. Toss it out like worthless rubbish. [Doctor] Robert, please tell me. For it will have no value in that day of wrath. See, it will neither feed nor satisfy you. Robert, that man is your uncle. He loves you and he provides for you. No. No. That man murdered my father. That's a fantasy. No, it isn't. And it is his love of money that is the reason for his sin. Then he raped my mother. It was the nightmare of a young child, Robert. (gentle music) Will you please? Get him. Get him. Please will you get him out? Next one. Who is the woman, Robert? (gentle music) Larry, that's my cousin Deborah. (gentle music) She is beautiful and she is innocent. She is not yet infected with their sin. I'm talking of her mother. Who is she to you? She is a Las Vegas chorus girl. Who is she to you, Robert? She and that vile man are the foxes. They're the little foxes that spoil the vines. For our vines have tender grapes. For the last time, Robert, who is she? She is nothing. To me. (gentle music) [Ralph] But Charles, I am using every legal trick I can but I can't- Well just what do we do to have him declared legally insane? Did I ever tell you that after he left the seminary, he wanted to cut off Knight Enterprises into little cottage industries with the working people sharing in managerial decisions. You told me. You told me. Well if that isn't loony, what is? Dr. Young is the key. He is not ready to testify. Oh for the money we're paying him, what's he waiting for? He likes Robert. He thinks there's hope. Nonsense. Do you think the good doctor could be dragging his feet figuring the longer he waits, the more money there is for him? That's a thought. You should pursue that. No, I'll call Miss Bouche. We've been taking good care of her. (phone ringing) Lena Bouche. Oh yes, Mr. Knight. Mm hm. Mm hm. I think that can be arranged. I'll call you tomorrow. (gentle music) This is Lamentations chapter three verse 34. See here he speaks of men like my uncle. (gentle music) He has trampled and crushed beneath his feet the lowly of the world and deprived them their God given rights and refused them justice. (gentle music) This is Amos chapter four. Listen to me you evil women who encourage your men to rob the poor and make a mockery of justice and corrupt all that should be good and right. You are not a priest nor a reverend. I have told you 100 times you cannot wear that clothing. May I please have my Bible? No. It disturbs you. Now. Get those clothes off. (gentle music) Now. Right now. (gentle music) Larry. Get them off him. I'll take them off. [Lena] Now. Right now. Nurse Bouche. Did you hear? I said now. Why don't you go outside and I'll see that he takes it off? (suspenseful music) No, that's what she wants you to do. (suspenseful music) [Lena] Get him. [Larry] Take it easy. No. No. No. No. No. (suspenseful music) No. (suspenseful music) Let it go. Sh. (suspenseful music) Sh, sh. Calm down. Sh. (suspenseful music) Isn't that enough? Isn't not enough? I can swear he feels this. I hope he does. Please, Miss Bouche, it's dangerous. What are you so worried about? They're easy to take care of when they're vegetables. What happened? One of the attendants said he went berserk. Completely. Without any provocation, he attacked me. It took four of us to subdue him. I trust you didn't exceed the dosage I prescribed. This can be very dangerous. Of course not. Take him to his room. I'll see him in the morning. Well sure. Yeah. Yes, I'll have a check for him. Bouche. Of course I know how to spell Bouche. What, Joanne? I have no idea where she is. Yes, yes. Yes, I'll see Doctor Young in the morning. Well of course I'll report to you as soon as I'm finished. Well thank you. Yeah, the same to you, Charles. Bye bye. Every time I see a half naked man in black socks I think of those old dirty French postcards. Mm. Speaking of dirty French postcards, are you making progress with Charles' assistant? Tommy's very loyal to Charles and I'm sure he's been promised the world, but I'm working on him. Hm? But wouldn't you be just a little bit jealous if? As long as you remember your heart belongs to daddy. Oh it does. It does. (dramatic music) (gentle music) Give it to me. (suspenseful music) Give it to me. I said give it to me. (suspenseful music) (gentle music) Must you go? Debbie should be going to bed soon. Yeah, I really must. I gotta ton of paperwork and Charles is gonna be expecting it in the morning. I hope Charles pays you sufficiently. If ever you should be unhappy over there, I could use someone like you. I would think Ralph, Mr. Davis, would take care of your needs. He's just the family attorney. I was thinking of more personal attention. (gentle music) [Elliot] What do you think you're doing? I was just going to- I told you, Kim, Mrs. Knight left strict orders not to be disturbed. But Deborah has to go to sleep now. Mrs. Knight will see her in the morning. A mother should say goodnight to her child. Mommy. I'm sorry, Mrs. Knight. Mommy, would you be coming to my ballet recital next week? I'll see you in your room in a moment. I have to walk Mr. Leary to his car. (gentle music) [Operator] 26 33, your pinpoint. [Cop] 27 okay. [Dispatcher] 27, that'd be 2297. Y'all have a good day. (dramatic music) Yes, I see. (doorbell ringing) I see. Thank you. I'll be waiting for your call. Oh, Captain. What was the name of the detective you've assigned to the case? Chernoff. Louis Chernoff. Thank you. Here's the cash for Miss Bouche. We won't be needing it. She's dead. Dead? In her office. Robert's fingerprints are all over the place. Police have him? He escaped. They didn't discover the body until a few hours ago. While I'm dressing, find out all you can about a Lieutenant Louis Chernoff. Everything. I get these headaches. Whew. They kill me. One thing that helps them is percodan. I would appreciate it if you would get me some. They're hard to find. I wish I could help you, but I don't have access to the drugs around here. How come nobody heard anything when he hit you? Well I'm telling you I was sitting right over there by the door reading. There? Yeah, right there. And after therapy, he should've slept all night. Next thing I knew I feel this fist. See? Right here. Ow. The other attendants say that you got those bruises in the afternoon when Robert went crazy. Sure you didn't help him? What do you mean help him? Did you hold her while Robert finished her off? The other attendants say you hated her. Everybody hated her. Oh. This headache is murder. Maybe I can find you some percodan. Good boy. 10 be enough? 20 would be better. (energetic music) (suspenseful music) And plie one. Sous sus two. Developpe three. Four. Rond de jambe five. Six. Al Gilbert Dance Studio, may I help you? Yes, just a second please. Deborah, the call is for you. For me? He says he's your cousin Robert. Robert. Robert. How's my favorite cousin? Robert, I'm your only cousin. Well if I had 100 cousins, you'd still be my favorite. Are you calling from the hospital? Nope, I'm right here in Los Angeles. Are you all better now? Oh honey, honey, I was never sick. They were just, you know, taking some tests. But Mommy and Uncle Charles said that- Listen, never mind Mommy and Uncle Charles. I'm gonna take you to lunch. How you know where to find me? What? You think I'd forget? Every Saturday 10:00 a.m. lessons at Felicia's. I'll be there at 11 to pick you up. But George is picking me up. Hey, hey, come on. I am a better chauffer than he is any day of the week. I'll see you at 11, okay? Okay. All right, Deborah. Bye bye. You must be Lieutenant Chernoff. Doctor Young told me I'd find you here. I'm Charles Knight, Robert's uncle. This is my associate Mr. Leary. Would you mind leaving us alone for a moment? This should only take a few minutes. May I have those papers, please? Thank you. Did you say there was $1000 in here? Now, Lieutenant. See you are two months behind your child support payments. Your home is in foreclosure. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What is this? Please, Lieutenant. I'm not near through. You've been in a detox center twice for alcohol abuse, but you're back using and not just alcohol I might add. You've been reprimanded twice in the last three months by your department. Ah, what's going on? What's the point of this? Well. Lieutenant, I was heartsick this morning when I learned what my nephew did. I knew Miss Bouche. She was a dedicated nurse. Her life was her patients. Robert is an animal who doesn't deserve to live. We have lavished the most expensive care imaginable. And now this. Lieutenant Chernoff, we do not want Robert to return to another hospital where he can snuff out another life. For humanity's sake it would be better if Robert were. Dead. Not caught, Lieutenant. Dead. There'll be another envelope with $10,000 more when that killer can no longer harm another human being. (gentle music) Robert. (gentle music) You have grown. How old are you now? 18? 19? Silly. You know I'm only nine. You don't look it. Gosh, you're becoming a beautiful young lady. [Deborah] I love you so, Robert. I love you too, sweetheart. So you're gonna be all better now? I sure am. I'm going back to the seminary and I'm gonna help you become a doctor. I don't know about becoming a doctor. I think I wanna be a ballet dancer. Oh yeah? Well, we'll talk about that at lunch. Where do you wanna go? Where's George? I gave him the day off. I think he went to see a girlfriend. Come on. (gentle music) How 'bout some mixing? (gentle music) (ominous music) Are you sure you're better now? Honey, why do you ask me that again? I told you I was never sick. But Uncle Charles kept saying- Sweetie, you can't listen to Uncle Charles 'cause Uncle Charles just hates me. He wants me out of the way. (hand pounding) What's that? It's something rolling around loose in the trunk. Listen Deborah, your father and my father wanted to change the way the company was run, see? But Uncle Charles fought 'em. And besides, he was greedy. And he wanted it all for himself. Uncle Charles wants to kill me. He does, honey. He does just like he killed my father. And just like he killed your father. My daddy died in a car accident. No, no, it was no accident. You gotta believe me, honey. You gotta, please. Uncle Charles is just an evil, evil man. Sweetheart, why don't you run and go get us a couple hot dogs, okay? And I'll see what that noise is all about, all right? Now hurry, I'm hungry. And get lots of mustard and relish. (suspenseful music) Robert. He didn't have any relish. I love Charles. But. Well he's older. Things aren't done the way they were 20 years ago. It's a new world we live in. The company has to expand or it'll die. Please. Think about my offer. We could do a wicked tango together. (gentle music) I always thought Ralph and you were. Ralph and I were what? Well, more than just lawyer-client. Tom, I told you last night. Ralph is my lawyer. He's been very supportive since my husband died. He's just my lawyer. Would you like to go to the sauna? (gentle music) The dry heat is wonderful. Excuse me. Yes. Deborah isn't home yet. Elliot probably took her to lunch. He always does after ballet, but they usually home by now. He probably took her to the movies. But he didn't tell me. Does he have to tell you everything? (gentle music) I hope the heat in there isn't too hot for you. Now I tell you what. Just you and me will go out to dinner. Would you like that? I'd love that, but you know. Mommy wouldn't let us. Sure she will. I'll call her. She wouldn't let us. She thinks you're. You're gonna say crazy, aren't ya? She thinks I'm crazy? Well, not exactly. Honey, she doesn't think I'm crazy. I mean, that's just insane. I mean, you say that sometimes, don't you? Like about some of the teachers at your school. Like don't you say I think she's crazy, huh? Or like about some of the boys at school. He's crazy. You don't mean it. It's just a way of talking. I'll tell you what, listen. When we get back into town, I will give your mom a call and you will see she will be tickled that I am taking you out. I understand you found Miss Bouche's car. That's why I'm here. Makes things worse. So now we have nothing to look for. I thought maybe you could give me some leads where he might possibly go, any friends. None that I know of. He was at the seminary all those years and then the hospital. I really don't know. Look, the office knows to call you in case anybody else spots him. I mean, they have his picture? They have it. Well, if you can think of anything, you know where you can leave a message. Well Tom will see you out. Well don't bother. How was your lunch with Joanne? It was pretty hot. I bet it was. She says nothing's going on between her and her lawyer friend. When we were in the sauna, she was pretty convincing. Do you think there's any truth to that? Sure. And the Pope is converting to Buddhism. (gentle music) I don't want this day to end. It's the happiest day of my life. (gentle music) It's mine, too. (gentle music) You hungry now? I'm starving. Should we go to dinner? (gentle music) Are you sure Mommy said it was okay? Honey, yeah, she said it was fine. Where should we go? Well, I'm gonna take you to a very, very special place. It's a place you never been before. It'll be a surprise. Okay? (gentle music) Why are you coming upstairs? I have to speak to Mrs. Knight. Deborah and George have not come home yet. I'm very worried. Mrs. Knight and her attorney are in conference now. I will advise her when they're through. But she's very late. Something may have happened. Have you completed setting the table downstairs? I thought so. Take care of your job, Kim. I'll be downstairs in a moment to check the table. Hi Cal, how are you? Good to see you. Well we gotta sign in here. At least I do. ♪ What a friend we have in Jesus Deborah, this is where we're gonna eat. See, the order where I studied at the seminary, they ran this mission. What's a mission? Well I have. Hi. Have you ever had anybody you know that was sick and needed taking care of or have you ever known anybody who didn't have a home or who was really hungry? I mean really, really- Yeah, yeah, I know. In Ethiopia, I saw it on TV. I'm not talking about Africa. I'm talking about right here in Los Angeles just minutes from where you live. See, I used to work here when I was with the seminary and I know these people. They're very nice. Come on. You can help me ladle out the food. (gentle music) ♪ All because of you All right, I need that big can of beans. Get me the big one. Robert. Good to see you. You too. Who's the pretty young lady? This is my cousin Deborah. Deborah, this is Brother Jason. He was with me at the seminary. Detective Louis Chernoff please. Yes I'll wait but please hurry. (gentle music) All right, that was pretty good. You know what? I think just a little bit more would be just right. Okay? (gentle music) Lou. This is Willie. Yeah. Lou, you know that Louie that you're looking for? I saw him. Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure it's him. I was standing about 10 feet away. At the Franscican Mission on Los Angeles Street. He went inside. He had a little girl with him and he drove up in this big limo. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'll go inside. Look, Lou. Lou. I'm dying, you know. I could use a fix real bad, okay? Yeah, I go inside. I'll watch him. I won't let him out of my sight. I promise. So how long you been out, Robert? A few days now. I have some business to take care of with the family and then I'm planning on coming back to the order. Oh yeah? I'll talk to Father Jack. We'll see, yeah. (dramatic music) Jason, would you hold this just for a second? I'm gonna go back in the back a second. Deborah. (ominous music) (dramatic music) Come on, Deborah, we have to leave. Something wrong, Robert? No, no, I forgot something. I have to go. But why do we have to leave? We can't stay. I like it here, Robert. I know you do, sweetie, but we gotta go, okay. We gotta go. (suspenseful music) Deborah, is she all right? What's wrong, Charles? [Charles] Robert's killed again. Who? Some police informant in a soup kitchen downtown. He has the limo and Deborah is with him. Where's George? [Charles] They don't know. He could be dead, too. What are the police doing? They have cars out all over looking for him. Lieutenant Chernoff thinks with him driving the limo, he'll be easier to find. Robert's got to bring Deborah back here sometime. I'll be staying here tonight if you have no objections. [Deborah] Did you really call my mom? Of course I did. When you went into the ladies room I called her. She never even lets me stay at a friend's house after school. Yeah well Deborah, this is different. Come on, I'm family. I can't believe she said that I can stay out with you all night. Okay, forget it. You want me to take you home? All right, I'll take you straight home then. No. Did she really say that I could stay out with you? Why would I lie to you? Especially to you? I'm gonna go and get us a room, okay? Okay. You just stay here. Hi. Hello. How are you? What can I do you out of, huh? Well, we're gonna need a room. Twin beds. How old is the girl? She's nine. [Marilyn] You don't look old enough to be her father. Oh no, I'm not. We're cousins. What are you celebrating something? A birthday? You rented a limo. No, that's her mother's car. She let us use it. We're supposed to take it to her down in San Diego and she didn't want us to drive at night so. Got a credit card? Yes. I mean, no. Cash. It'll be $55. [Robert] 55. Room two. It's right behind mine. If you need anything, there's a connecting door. Just knock. Thank you. Take over for me. (gentle music) And in this beautiful world, nobody was ever poor. And there was no need for soup kitchens. And all the children had homes. They lived at home with their mommies and their daddies. And if their grandmas and their grandpas didn't live with them, well they lived right next door. In this beautiful world, everybody was very happy. And they helped each other. (gentle music) (hand knocking) (gentle music) (hand knocking) Hi. Would you like a drink? Thank you, but it's kinda late. Thank you though. Maybe for a nine year old. Come on. Keep me company for awhile. (gentle music) Maybe for just a few minutes. Got some beer. Oh no, no thank you. Maybe a soda. - Sure. - Do you have a soda? Sure. Oh. Don't have any clean glasses. Do you mind drinking from the can? No, that'll be fine. Great. (gentle music) Thank you. Come on, honey, make yourself comfortable. (gentle music) So you're rich, huh? Well, the family is rich. It's all the same. Comes down to you in the end. See. In Proverbs, it is said that the man who knows right from wrong and who has common sense and good judgment is happier than the man who is immensely rich. Is that what it says? What's wrong with having it both? In Proverbs, it is also said that your riches will not help you on judgment day. Well I don't have to worry any on that score. My only problem is getting the payments for that Corvette out there parked next to your limo. (soft music) Well. Thank you very much for the soda. I better. Wait. Don't go. Don't go. Wanna have a little fun? Fun? So I used to get about 200 an hour, but you're kind of cute. How 'bout 100? Come on, honey. Come on. You'll remember Marilyn for the rest of your life. Don't be so nervous. - Please, please. Please, ma'am. Please don't touch me. What's the matter with you? What are you some kind of fag or something? No. No, I just. I gotta take care of my cousin Deborah. - Oh. - Okay? Oh yeah, sure. Oh no, I get it, I get it. I'm too old for you, right, huh? Yeah, oh sure. You like little girls, right? I bet you can't wait to get in there and play doctor, huh? Cousins. What bullshit. Okay, honey. I ask you for 100 for me and you said no, okay, but if you want that little darling in there, it's gonna cost you 500. Yeah, you heard me. 500. Because if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna go over there to that telephone, and I'm gonna call the cops and tell them that I got some rich pervert in room two who's molesting a nine year old. You don't believe me, do you? Please don't. Just don't call the police, okay? Please. All I want is the 500. You don't believe I'm gonna do it, do you? (ominous music) Hello, police. (ominous music) (suspenseful music) Mr. Knight will be down in a moment. Hey, what time did you say it was? 4:15. If you need me, Lieutenant, I'll be in my room down the hall. Thank you. Did you get him? No. But he got two more. Or at least we think he did. Where? You know our cars found a limo in a parking lot of a motel on sixth near downtown. When they opened the trunk, they found the chauffer. When they inquired inside, they found the motel's night manager dead. Looks like the same knife he used on the guy at the soup kitchen. Was Deborah with him? I don't know. She was with him at the soup kitchen. I suppose she's still with him. Well if he left the limo, they couldn't have gotten too far. Well I called the owner of the motel at his house. He said the lady who managed the motel drove a red convertible. There was no convertible in the parking lot and there were no keys in her purse. Look. This is getting out of hand. There are a lot of people out looking for him. You haven't forgotten our deal, have you? Not for a minute. (gentle music) I don't remember leaving the motel. And the car. What happened to Mommy's car? Well I heard that noise again and so my friend's fixing it and he lent us this one. (gentle music) Did you sleep well? (gentle music) Why did we leave the motel? (gentle music) 'Cause it was unclean. It was a house of greed where they wanted bribes. (gentle music) Deborah. I think you should become a doctor when you grow up. I don't know. Okay well. Well promise me that at least you'll think about it 'cause the world needs healing, Deborah, and you can help. I think I wanna go home. We are. We're going right home. I gotta go see Uncle Charles. But before we do that, remember that room downstairs? The one we used to play in together. When we put on shows. I still go down there, but it's not as much fun without you. Well, we're gonna rehearse a show. Just you and me and then later in the day, we're gonna surprise him. What do you think? But won't Mommy worry? No, of course not. She knows you're with me. She'll figure we slept late. I mean it is Sunday, isn't it? Come on, let's go home. Okay. We're almost there. (gentle music) What is it, Kim? I thought I heard something. Course you did. You heard me. Get back to work. Wow. There's even more stuff here than there was two years ago. (hand knocking) Come in. Good morning, sir. Paper. Oh, Elliot. The clothes I wore last night are a bit rumpled. Would you please press them? I'll be wearing them later. Yes, sir. Is Mrs. Knight awakened yet? Not yet, sir. Tell her I must see her when she does. Yes, sir. Oh and Elliot. My associate, Mr. Leary, should be here shortly. Dr. Young from the hospital will be with him. Tell them I'll meet them by the pool. Yes, sir. (lamp clanking) (suspenseful music) Hello. (suspenseful music) Hello. Kim. Deborah, oh. You all right? You all right? I was so worried. Don't be afraid, Kim. Don't you remember Cousin Robert? Hi, Kim. It's good to see you again. Kim, there's no reason to be afraid. No, the doctor said I'm fine. I'm all better now. He is, Kim. He is. We've been every place. We went to the ocean. Then we went to a mission where they feed poor people. Do you know any poor people? But. They said. They said what? They. Say it, Kim. Don't be afraid. They say you kill a man. Maybe others. Well they lie. Who is they? Your Uncle Charles. Well Uncle Charles is a liar. Tell her, Deborah. You were with me all the time. He was. Robert couldn't kill anybody. Kim, would you please bring us some breakfast? We really are hungry. Yes Kim, please. Why don't you come upstairs? I feed you in the kitchen. But they'll make me go away and see Deborah and I wanted to spend our Sunday together. Please. Please, Kim. We'll stay down here and play like we used to. Please. All right. I bring you breakfast. [Robert] Thank you, Kim. (phone ringing) Hello. Ralph, Dr. Young is here. Tom and Charles are with him. They're looking at papers that Dr. Young is showing them. Uh oh, I was afraid of that. I bet they're the stock transfers and voting proxies that Tom brought there last week. How could he be so brazen? He has to know I can see them. Well, he's doing it deliberately. He's trying to tell us that he's got control now. Surrender and he'll make it easy for us. I don't know what that word means. Look Joanne, look hey. Okay, worst you've got one third. Maybe we should just relax and accept. Over my dead body. How soon can you get here? About an hour. Make it an hour and a half. Make it an hour. I understand, but last week you agreed to $50,000. 100 is a very fair figure. You stand to make millions. Many millions. But you agreed to the 50. It was very difficult getting Robert to sign. I had to involve others. Miss Bouche is dead. The attendants who helped me aren't. Tom, write him a check for the additional 50. No checks, please. Cash. But this is Sunday morning. Where can I get my hands on cash like that? Well, let's make an appointment for tomorrow. After the banks open. Tom. Go to my home and get the money out of my safe. He shouldn't be more than a half an hour. I'll have Elliot bring you some more coffee. Kim. Thank you for breakfast. I appreciate everything you've ever done for me. You are a true Christian. I go to church on Sundays. No, but I mean you act like a Christian. You don't merely give lip service to his teachings. Do you know what I mean? I think I do. I better go upstairs. Mr. Elliot will wonder where I am. When will you be coming upstairs? After lunch. That's what Deborah and I agreed. Right? - Yeah. [Robert] Kim. Uncle Charles is upstairs, isn't he? Yes. In a guest room. (gentle music) You will always take care of Deborah, won't you? Watch over her. And care for her. Always? Promise? (gentle music) I love you, Kim. (gentle music) Sweetheart, I have to go and see Uncle Charles now. I'll go with you. No. No, see. See he and I have some business to take care of. Now you agreed. Remember? You stay until after lunch and you mustn't leave until I come and get you, okay? But what will I do here? Well. Well. Let me think. You're gonna be a great doctor. Right? And this. This is the tsar's palace. And the revolution has begun. And there. Oh my goodness. There are wounded men all over the place. Oh. Look at that poor soldier. You see him? Look at him. Don't worry young man. Dr. Knight will have you as good as new. She will. Look over there. That poor man. He's bleeding. Oh my gosh. Deborah, go. Go help him before he loses too much blood. (dramatic music) Uncle Charles is waiting for me. You're feeling smug, aren't you, Charles? Smug? Not at all. I just thought it best that we declare a truce. I now have control. Which is only right. My brothers were wimps. So you had them murdered. Murdered? That's all right, Charles. I didn't much like my husband anyway and Robert's father was a wimp, but I'm not, and you're not finished with me yet. Giving away your sexual favors isn't gonna get you very far. You wasted your time on Tom. How does it feel? Giving away your goodies for nothing. A great philosopher once said, it ain't over 'til it's over. It ain't over, Charles. I wouldn't do anything silly. You should be more concerned about your daughter. I haven't even heard you ask about her. She's with Robert. He loves her. He wouldn't hurt her. I'm not worried. I would be. He's loony as a bed bug. (suspenseful music) Sexual favors isn't gonna get you very far. (suspenseful music) Oh my God. Why did you come in here? Elliot, why did you come in here? (suspenseful music) (ominous music) Oh my God. (ominous music) Oh. (ominous music) (suspenseful music) [Dispatcher] 649, Edward. Carry now, Edward. Line wondering. Line David. [David] David. [Dispatcher] David for ten-21640 East Cross Street. 6-4-0 East. There's a complaint about an apartment number. That's a 1021, Dave. It's the car, all right. (doorbell ringing) Seven times I rang that bell. Where's Elliot? I don't know, sir. He must be busy. Where's Mr. Knight? He's upstairs with Miss Joanne. Thank you. (phone ringing) Yes. Where's Elliot? I don't know, Mrs. Knight. Well who just answered the door? I did. [Joanne] Was it my attorney? No, Mrs. It was Mr. Leary. I see. Well, when Mr. Davis arrives, send him directly upstairs. (suspenseful music) [Tom] Robert. (suspenseful music) Do you know where my Uncle Charles is? (suspenseful music) He's not here, Robert. (suspenseful music) You are a liar. No, no. He's not here, Robert. [Robert] Yes. No. Why, why do you have to lie? [Tom] He's not here, Robert. No, I heard his voice in the hall. Robert, you got the wrong guy. The Bible says thou shalt not lie. [Tom] Robert, you got the wrong guy. It is says thou. [Tom] You got the wrong guy. Shalt not lie. Robert, he's not here. He's not here. Thou shalt not lie. Thou shalt not. Kill. (suspenseful music) [Robert] Oh my God. (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (phone ringing) Hello. What's taking you so long? What's wrong? I was just leaving. Don't ask questions. Just get here as fast as you can. Look, you're sounding very strange. What is it? Is it, Robert? Yes. Get here quickly. Should I call the police? (ominous music) Joanne. I said should I call the police? (ominous music) Joanne. (ominous music) What'd you say? I said should I call the police? No. No. Just get over here. (ominous music) [Deborah] Robert. Robert, speak to me, please. You frighten me. I'm gonna call Kim. No, wait. Honey, wait. Honey, you gotta get out of this house. It is Armageddon. They have spent their years on earth satisfying their every whim and now their fat hearts are ready for the slaughter. Sweetie, you gotta get away. You got to leave. Where's Elliot? I don't know, sir. I haven't seen him for awhile. I heard the chimes a few moments ago. Who was it? I answered the door. It was Mr. Leary. I sent him upstairs. I thought you were there. Tom. Tom. Ah. (suspenseful music) You fool. (suspenseful music) They'll hang you for this. No, they won't, Charles. They'll know it was you. No, they won't. Your crazy nephew's running all over this house and before it's through, his fingerprints will be all over the knife. (suspenseful music) You slut. (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) Yes. Kim, Robert's in the house. I know he is. Where is he? I asked you a question. Where is he? I don't know. You're lying. Never mind. I'll be right down. Kim. Kim, I was just bringing Deborah to you. Now listen to me. You must take her away. No. It is you who must go. Mrs. Knight knows you're here. That doesn't matter. It was just a question of time. A plague is settling on the house. You must leave. All who remain will die. But Robert- Go, go. Take Deborah with you and keep her. All right? Protect her. Keep her warm. - Please- - Listen to me. Go with God, Deborah. He loves you both, all right. Now go, Deborah, go. Mrs. Knight, have you seen Charles? Mr. Knight? I've been in my room. I last saw him from my window with you. What about Mr. Leary? Has he returned? I really don't know. Well. I better be going. If Mr. Knight still wishes to reach me, I'll be at the hospital. Dr. Young. If Charles is unable to conclude his business with you, perhaps I can. Of course. (gentle music) Kim. Kim. Robert? Deborah? Kim? I know you're here. Deborah, please. Please tell me you're all right. [Robert] She's all right. She's not here. What do you mean? Where is she? I sent her away. She is blameless and she doesn't belong in a house of evil and cruelty. Where did you send her? Never mind where I sent her. She's with Kim. Kim will shield her and keep her from the decay that permeates the very air that one breathes in this house. Robert. I don't want Charles to hear us. (gentle music) I saw the bodies of Elliot and Tom. It was Charles you meant to kill I know. (gentle music) I'd like to see Charles dead, too. He killed my husband. Your Uncle Edward. And your father. Charles killed him, too. And your mother. He raped her. Remember? Charles doesn't deserve to live. (gentle music) He should be killed, Robert. (gentle music) I brought your knife, Robert. (gentle music) Can you see it? (suspenseful music) Will you help me kill Charles? Robert? Will you? (gentle music) If you don't kill him, he'll send you back to the hospital. One with bars where they do terrible things to the patients. (gentle music) I'm going to throw the knife, Robert. (gentle music) Watch me. I'm going to throw it now. (suspenseful music) Go ahead. Pick it up, Robert. Pick it up quickly. Do you see it? Can you see it, Robert? (doorbell ringing) [Louis] Who are you? Who am I? I'm Ralph Davis, Mrs. Knight's attorney. Who are you? Police. [Ralph] Police? I found the last car the loony stole parked nearby. I think he and the kid could be in here. Well. Where is everybody? I'm gonna look around. I'll check Mrs. Knight's room. (suspenseful music) (hand knocking) Hello. Quickly. Pick it up. (gentle music) Hurry up, Robert. We don't want Charles to get away. (gentle music) Go ahead. Pick it up. (suspenseful music) Oh. (suspenseful music) Oh. Oh God. Hurry, Robert. We don't want to keep Charles waiting. (gentle music) Lift it up. (gentle music) Show me that you have it. (gentle music) Do you have it, Robert? Lift it up and show me that you have it. (suspenseful music) (gun firing) Ah. (suspenseful music) (gun firing) Ah. (gun clicking) (suspenseful music) (woman screaming) (gentle music) (suspenseful music) (woman screaming) (gun firing) (suspenseful music) (woman screaming) (gentle music) (gun firing) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) What happened? Hey, hey, put the gun down. Put it down. (gentle music) Where's Mr. Knight? I have to talk to him. He's dead. Dead? Dead? Where's his assistant? Come on, leave me alone. Put that down. Put it down. He's dead, too, come on, put it down. Put that down. Put the goddamn gun down. Shit. Shit. (gun firing) Jesus Christ. What the hell's wrong with you? What are you crazy? What the hell are you trying to do? I need a drink. (gentle music) Hi. Hi. What's wrong with your arm? I broke it. Does it hurt? Not now. It did when I broke it. How did you break it? I'm a dancer. A pretty clumsy one. I sort of fell right on. My name is Deborah. What's yours? Robert. Robert? I have a cousin named Robert. He's been sick. Do you think he'll get better? I hope so. Oh, this is Kim. She's the maid at our house. You have tights on. Are you going to ballet class? No. I did yesterday. I'm gonna spend some time at Kim's house. Well are you gonna be a ballet dancer when you grow up? I don't know. I thought I did but. Maybe I'll become a doctor. I think that'll be wonderful. That'd be great. You think so? So does my cousin Robert. He wants me to become a doctor. Maybe I will. (gentle music)
