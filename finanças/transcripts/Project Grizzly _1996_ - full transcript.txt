[ Wind howling ] [ Crow cawing ] [ Laboured breathing ] WELL, I'LL TELL YA. THIS IS BRINGING BACK... A LOT OF MEMORIES. THIS IS... SO CLOSE TO... TO WHERE IT ALL HAPPENED WITH THE OLD MAN, IT'S ALMOST EERIE. 'CEPT THIS LITTLE, UH, THIS LITTLE MEADOW HERE, IF YOU CAN CALL IT THAT, WAS ABOUT MAYBE 50 FEET WIDER ON EACH SIDE, BUT THIS IS JUST WHAT, THIS IS THE WAY IT WAS. IT WAS JUST LIKE A BOX CANYON WHEN I MET THE OLD MAN. HE CAME OUTTA THICK BUSH ON A SMALL TRAIL, 'CEPT THEN I HAD A RUBBER DINGHY BLOWN UP OVER TOP OF MY HEAD SO I WAS WALKING LIKE THIS. HAD A 40, 50 POUND KNAPSACK ON MY BACK, HAD AN ALUMINUM SLUICE IN MY LEFT HAND AND A 22 CALIBRE RIFLE IN MY RIGHT. SO I'D BE WALKING LIKE THIS. AND THEN I'D COME TO A, WHAT WAS LIKE AN OPEN AREA. I HAD THICK, CONIFEROUS AND DECIDUOUS FORESTS ON MY LEFT AND TO MY RIGHT AND IT WAS OPEN TO THE FRONT BUT THERE WAS BUSH THERE. AND ANOTHER 100 FEET WAS MY SECONDARY TRAIL WHERE I HAD TO LEAD TO MY BASE CAMP. AND I COULD, WELL FOR THREE DAYS I HAD BEEN FEELING THIS, UH, THIS PRESENCE THAT WAS WATCHING ME ALL THE TIME, IT WAS REALLY, IT WAS WHACKING MY MIND OUT FOR DAYS AND DAYS AND DAYS. AND THEN I HIT IT ON THE MEADOW. I HAD COME TO A FULL STOP BECAUSE I'M LIKE THIS, AND I COULD FEEL, I MEAN I COULD FEEL THAT SOME- THING WAS WATCHING ME. I MEAN IT WAS RIGHT THERE. SO I THREW UP LIKE THIS AND THE DINGHY WENT ONE WAY, AND I'M LOOKING AROUND LIKE THIS, AND I CAN, I CAN JUST... I COULD SEE IT RIGHT OFF TO THE FAR LEFT, STANDING OVERTOP OF A STUMP, JUST PRETTY AS YOU PLEASE, LIKE A HUMAN BEING... GRIZZLY BEAR. [ Bears growling ] AND EVER SINCE THAT DAY, FROM THAT DAY FORWARD, I'VE NEVER FIGURED OUT WHY IT HAPPENED. NEVER. NEVER FROM THE MEDICINE MEN TO THE PSYCHOLOGISTS, TO THE DREAM ANALYSTS, TO EVERYBODY. IT JUST HAPPENED BECAUSE IT HAPPENED, AND IN THAT THE BEAR DIDN'T KILL ME, I'VE BEEN ON HIS TRAIL EVER SINCE. [ ♪♪♪ ] [ Horses snorting/ galloping ] [ Whistling ♪♪♪ ] Interviewer: AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF WORK, TROY HURTUBISE HAS DESIGNED AND BUILT A SUIT OF CLOTHING THAT IS GUARANTEED TO PROTECT HIM AGAINST A GRIZZLY BEAR ATTACK.

Well, it's taken a while but like you say, yeah, finally we got there. It's about time. YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU AND I HAVE TALKED A COUPLE OF OTHER TIMES. Yes, we have. A couple other times over the years. BUT THIS IS THE SUIT? Yeah, yeah, this is the suit. $100,000 later and 7 years research, We finally got to a suit capable of doing what we want with regards to grizzly research. NOW, DESCRIBE IT FOR ME, TROY. HOW BIG IS IT? Ah, well, I'm 5'8" and when I close myself inside the suit, I'm looking at about 7, 7'2". That's the height of it. The weight's 147 pounds, which is relatively light for its protec- tion capabilities. And, uh, it's extremely large. I mean, the head itself, the outer head, There's, like, two chambers to it. The outer head is, ah, you're probably looking at, you know, 2 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet. Troy: [ In suit ] I'M FOCUSING ON YOU. OKAY. ♪ I'VE GOT SPURS... ♪ ♪ THAT JINGLE, JANGLE, JINGLE ♪ NO.

HALF THE MEN DIDN'T EVEN DIE GETTING HIT. IT'S WHEN THEY FELL OFF THE HORSE. YEAH. IT'S WHEN THEY FELL OFF THE HORSE, THEY BREAK A LEG OR BREAK THEIR NECK, YEAH. YEAH. IT'S NOT SO YOU GET HIT BY THE LANCE AND YOU'RE NOT THINKING, "OH, THAT HURT." YOU'RE THINKING, "OH, MY GOD, I'M FALLING." AND THAT'S IT, WHEN THEY FELL OFF THE HORSES, THEY NEEDED 2 MEN TO PICK THEM UP. YEAH, OH, YEAH! STAND BY. HERE SHE COMES. [ Heavy sigh ] YOU OKAY? MM-HM. [ Grunting ] OKAY, TAKE HER OFF. I GOT IT. OKAY. [ Sigh ] HOW'D THAT ONE GO? BETTER THAN THE FIRST. 'CAUSE I HAD THAT, UH, THAT STUFF IN MY MOUTH, YEAH. IF I HAVE A MOUTHPIECE, A MOUTHPIECE YOU CAN DO THAT ALL DAY LONG. I GOT THE AIR BAGS IN THE BACK, EH, SO MY NECK HASN'T GOT A LOT OF PLACE SO THAT'LL BE PERFECT FOR THE GRIZZLY. I CAN, I CAN TAKE WHAT HE CAN GIVE ME.

Park wardens are now out looking for a grizzly and her cub. Christine McNab reports. Christine: Park wardens say the grizzly bear ripped through three tents at around 3:00 o'clock this morning. THREE TENTS! Two people, including a German and an Australian tourist, were badly injured, with bites and gashes. They're in a Calgary hospital and will have surgery today. Another Australian and a woman from Montana JESUS! were also hurt, but not as badly. They're in the Banff hospital and doctors are stitching them up. IN BANFF OF ALL PLACES. Here in Lake Louise the campground is closed, as are many of the trails. Park wardens are warning people on bicycles and on foot to stay well away from the area. Park wardens are still on the lookout for the bear. They think it's a medium- sized grizzly with a year and a half year old cub. They believe this bear has... MEDIUM-SIZED GRIZZLY, WE GOT A FEMALE. ... ripped unoccupied tents apart earlier this week and also chased a cyclist. Chief warden says if they find the bear, she and her cub will likely be destroyed. JESUS. Christine McNab, CBC News, Lake Louise. JESUS! FIVE INJURED! UNBELIEVABLE.

[ ♪♪♪ ] Troy's voice: IT'S ALWAYS THE TRIP UP ON ALL THE EXPEDITIONS. IT'S NOT THE ACTUAL SITTING WITH THE BEARS OR DOING THE RESEARCH, WHICH IS IRONIC, YOU'D THINK IT WOULD BE. IT'S THE ANTICIPATION, THE ADRENALINE, THE RUSH. [ Helicopter whirring ] UH, TROY'S GOING TO BE MOVING ALONG THE TRAIL THAT'S ALONG THIS TREE LINE ON THIS LARGE, BLONDE RIDGE LINE DOWN HERE. AND, UH, BY THE TIME HE GETS AROUND TO ABOUT THE CORNER OF THAT RIDGE LINE, WE EXPECT THE BEAR TO BE TAKING OFFENCE TO HIM BEING IN ITS TERRITORY, AND WE'LL BE HITTING HIM SOMEWHERES THERE. RICO, YOU AND I, AS SOON AS WE GET TROY DRESSED AND ON HIS WAY DOWN OVER IN HERE, HE'LL BE, WE'LL BE COMING DOWN OFF OF THAT, THAT RIDGE LINE AND GETTING DOWN INTO THE LOW, OPEN GROUND DOWN IN THROUGH HERE. AND THE PURPOSE OF THAT IS IF TROY STUMBLES OR FALLS IN THERE, WE CAN JUST CUT RIGHT BACK UP TO THE RIDGE LINE, STAND HIM BACK UP WITH, WITH THE LEAST AMOUNT OF FUSS AND MUSS, GET RIGHT BACK DOWN IN AGAIN AND HE CAN CONTINUE ON. SURE, DOWN THERE. WE'LL MOVE RIGHT AROUND INTO THE LOW GROUND OVER HERE SO THAT WE ARE IN A POSITION TO MOVE UP AND PROTECT AND DEFEND AS REQUIRED. Troy: ALL WE WANT, THE WORST TO HAPPEN TO THAT BEAR IS THAT HE'S PISSED OFF. LIKE, YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT NO INJURY TO HIM. Troy: RIGHT. NOW SEE, THERE'S A BIG SCENARIO WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT, RIGHT? YEAH, WHAT IF I, YOU KNOW. Man: IF YOU FALL, I THINK YOU'RE GONNA LAY THERE FAIRLY FLAT. Troy: OKAY. AND WE'LL JUST COME, WE'LL JUST COME RIGHT BACK UP, STAND YOU BACK UP AND GO RIGHT BACK DOWN. AND RON'LL BE ON YOUR ASS WHERE THAT BEAR IS, RIGHT, RON? CALL ON RADIO, IN OTHER WORDS DON'T, IF YOU, IF HE DECIDES TO BREAK OFF, EATING, BECAUSE WE GOT A LITTLE COMMOTION, HE PICKS US UP. HE'LL PICK US UP IN THE WIND, EASY. UH, HE STARTS MOVING TOWARDS THE TREE LINE. YOU'RE JUST GONNA SIGNAL, SAY, "HE'S ON THE RUN." SO HE COULD BE COMING OUT ANYWHERE. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? BUT THERE'S NO POINT IN JUST LEAVING YOU THERE. THERE'S NO POINT IN CAN- CELLING THE WHOLE THING JUST 'CAUSE YOU FELL DOWN. WE MIGHT AS WELL TAKE THE CHANCE OF HIM SEEING, OF HIM, OF THE NOISE, AND HIM RUNNING OFF, WHICH, WHICH ISN'T LIKELY TO HAPPEN. WE'LL JUST GO UP THERE, STAND YOU BACK UP, GET YOU GOING AGAIN AND JUST COME RIGHT, THERE WON'T BE ANY NOISE FROM US. OKAY. WHEN I YELL, "WHISKY," AND I'M IN TROUBLE, OR I WANT TO GET OUT OF THE SUIT, AND THE OTHER GUYS ARE COMING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN THERE, AND YOU GUYS ARE IN THIS POSITION HERE, IT'S NOT GONNA BE JUST ONE POP AND THEN THE, THE BIRD BOMB GOES OFF. IT'S GONNA BE LIKE THIS, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. SO YOU LET 'EM GO, KEITH. JUST SHOW ME HOW SHE'S GONNA GO. Troy: AND THEN THE BIG ONES HERE, YOU GOT ONE OF THOSE, RICO? BIG BABIES? THESE ARE A LIFE- SAVER RIGHT HERE. NOW BESIDES, YEAH, YEAH, NOW. THIS IS, MY UNCLE JOHN'LL HAVE THESE AND HE'LL BE COMING DOWN THE RIDGE. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS, WHAT THE HELL THESE THINGS ARE? THEY'RE JUST LIKE A BIG FIRECRACKER. YOU LIGHT THEM THE SAME WAY YOU DO A TRIP FLARE. AND THEY HAVE A LITTLE FUSE ON THEM, ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN THROW THEM AND THEY GO OFF WITH A BIT LOUDER BANG THAN WHAT YOU SAW. LOTS OF SMOKE. YEAH. LOUD FLASH, LOTS OF SMOKE. AND THAT SHOULD STARTLE THEM AS WELL. SO WE'VE GOT THESE CONTINUOUSLY FIRING OUT OF THE GUN, AND THEN WE GOT UNCLE JOHN JUST LOBBING THESE THINGS IN, JUST LIKE GRENADES. SO YOU GOT A LOT GOING ON. AND THEN YOU GOT, UH, RICO. AND YOU GOT, UH, TWO OF THE OTHER WRANGLERS UP THERE, FIRING INTO THE AIR, OR MAYBE BLOWING UP DIRT IN FRONT OF THEM. SO WITH ALL THIS COMMOTION AND THAT, HOLY JEEZ, I'M GONNA TELL YOU, HE'S GONNA HAVE TO BE A POSSESSED BEAR TO STILL BE STICKING AROUND, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? [ ♪♪♪ ] BASICALLY, EVERYTHING UP HERE IS A, IS, IS THE EDGE FOR ME. I MEAN, MY FIRST HORSEBACK RIDING, THE FIRST TIME IN THE ROCKIES, UM, YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING. MY FIRST TIME 10 METRES FROM A GRIZZLY. NO, BUT I FEEL A LOT... THE EDGE IS THERE AND IT'S FABULOUS TO GET THE RUSH OF ADRENALINE. I MEAN, THE GRIZZLY DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE THERE, JUST THE THOUGHT OF IT BEING THAT DISTANCE IS ENOUGH TO GET THAT ADRENALINE FLOWING, BUT WE'VE GOT, WE'VE GOT THREE GOOD MEN HERE THAT, UH, THAT ARE GOOD TO HAVE BEHIND YOU, YOU KNOW, AT YOUR BACK, HOPEFULLY IN THE FRONT. HOPEFULLY ANYWHERE THEY'RE STANDING. I MEAN, IT FEELS PRETTY SAFE. BUT, UH, TO BE HONEST, PRETTY, WELL, ANY TIME I'M AROUND TROY, I HAVE THE EDGE. SO... BUT I DON'T GO LOOKING FOR IT FOR MYSELF. IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I WENT TO VIETNAM, I SUPPOSE, WAS, WAS FOR THE FUN, TRAVEL AND ADVENTURE, AND TO GET A, A FEEL FOR WHAT IT WAS LIKE IN COMBAT. WE WERE OUT ON A MISSION THAT HAD A REAL QUIET AREA OF OPERATION, NOTHING HAPPENED. AND, AND WE WERE GETTING FIDGETY AND NEEDED THE FIX AND SO WE PLAYED THE GAME THAT WE CALLED "OUTRUN THE HAND-GRENADE". AND, UH, AND THE RULES WERE QUITE SIMPLE. YOU PULLED A HAND- GRENADE OUTTA YOUR BELT, YOU PULLED THE PIN, YOU POPPED THE SPOON, AND YOU HAD TO SET IT AT YOUR FEET. YOU COULDN'T THROW IT AT YOUR FEET, YOU HAD TO POP THE SPOON, SET IT AT YOUR FEET. AND THEN YOUR CHOICE WAS TO EITHER RUN JUST AS HARD AND FAST DOWN THE TRAIL AS, THAT, UNTIL IT WENT OFF. OR, UH, YOU WOULD SELECT A PIECE OF GROUND THAT HAD JUST THE SLIGHTEST LITTLE DEPRESSION IN IT. AND THIS COULD BE ANYWHERE FROM MAYBE A COUPLE OF STEPS AWAY TO, TO JUST AN ARM'S LENGTH AWAY. AND YOU'D JUST GET DOWN IN THAT DEPRESSION AND LAY AS FLAT AS YOU CAN UNTIL IT WENT OFF. AND THEN YOU'D SORT OF FEEL AROUND AND EVERYTHING IS, UH, IS STILL IN ONE PLACE. AND YOU'D GET UP AND... AND FEELING GOOD 'CAUSE YOU HAD THAT ADRENALINE, ADRENALINE RUSH. Troy: I MISUNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION, "WHAT'S YOUR EDGE?" NOT "WHAT YOU'RE HERE FOR?" I'M NOT HERE TO FLY WITHOUT A PARACHUTE, THAT DON'T LOOK GOOD. NO, I'M HERE FOR THE GRIZZLY. I'M HERE FOR THE PRESERVATION PART OF IT. GOD ONLY KNOWS WHEN THE NEXT ONE'S GONNA BE. I DON'T KNOW.

I can see all the people down below me and it's just a perfect spot should a bear come out at any angle, I'll be able to cover it from here. Over. This is Keith. Okay, that sounds good. Once you see Troy starting to move, can you start a watch and, uh, time it to the edge of the gully on the other side? This is Ron. That shouldn't be any problem. I can see him perfectly from where I'm at. It's just a matter of you letting me know when he's actually gonna start the first step, and as soon as he does that, I'll be able to start the timing. I think he's gonna have a little bit of a rough time, though, because the terrain is a bit rough and that suit's awful heavy, and we'll see how it goes. Over.

HE'S GONNA BE GONE SO FAST MAKE YOUR HEAD SPIN. HERE'S WHAT'S GONNA HAVE TO HAPPEN. AND IT COULD WORK. I'M GONNA HAVE TO DRESS RIGHT AT THE VERY TOP. YEAH, I WOULD. THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING.

[ ♪♪♪ ] MANY A MAN HAS SNICKERED AT ME, AND MANY A MAN HAS LAUGHED. EVEN MEN UP HERE LIKE THIS, IT NEVER MADE ANY SENSE TO ME. THEY SHOULD KNOW BETTER... ABOUT CARRYING KNIVES AS BIG AS I DO IN THE BUSH. BUT IF YOU DO YOUR RESEARCH AND YOU TALK TO ANY MAN THAT'S EVER LIVED IN MOUNTAINS LIKE THIS, AIN'T NO TRAPPER ALIVE, AIN'T NO MOUNTAIN MAN ALIVE WORTH HALF THEIR WEIGHT IN SPIT, CARRIES LESS THAN AN ARKANSAS TOOTHPICK OR A BOWIE ON HIM. A GUN'S ONE THING, A GUN CAN BE DROPPED. A GUN CAN RUN OUT OF BULLETS AND A GUN CAN GET WET. A KNIFE IS ALWAYS WITH YA. YOU PACK IT INTO COUNTRY LIKE THIS, IT'S WEIGHT. AXES, FORGET IT. YOU NEED A BOWIE KNIFE. NOW, A BOWIE LIKE THIS, THIS IS A NINE AND A HALF INCH BOWIE. AND ANY MOUNTAIN MAN WORTH ANYTHING CARRIES A BOWIE KNIFE BIGGER THAN THIS, A LOT BIGGER THAN THIS. I'VE MET MEN IN THE MOUNTAINS AND THIS IS WHAT THEY CARRY. THIS THING HAS 1000 PURPOSES IN THE BUSH FOR IT. YOU DON'T CARRY A KNIFE UNLESS YOU CAN USE IT. I GO IN THE BUSH, I DON'T USE A GUN. NEVER. DON'T BELIEVE IN GUNS. I SWEAR BY MY KNIVES. THEY SAVE YOUR LIFE 1000 TIMES AROUND. IF A GRIZZLY'S GONNA COME AT YOU, AND I'M NOT SAYING KNIVES ARE GONNA SAVE YOU, THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING. WHAT I'M SAYING IS YOU'VE GOT A GUN, AND THAT GRIZZLY'S 50 FEET, 100 FEET AWAY FROM YOU. YOU'VE GOT ONE SHOT. I DON'T GIVE A SHIT WHO YOU ARE OR HOW STEADY YOU ARE. YOU'VE GOT ONE SHOT AT THAT GRIZZLY. AND IF HE'S STILL COMING AT YOU, THAT GUN, YOU MIGHT AS WELL USE THE BARREL ON HIM. OR YOU CAN USE THE STOCK ON HIM, THAT'S USELESS. BUT IF YOU'VE GOT SOME HALF DECENT KNIVES, AT LEAST YOU'VE GOT A FIGHTING CHANCE WITH ANIMALS. BUT THAT'S NOT THE REASON WHY, WHEN I GO INTO THE MOUNTAINS OR I GO INTO THE BUSH OR ANY MAN GOES INTO THE BUSH, THEY DON'T CARRY KNIVES FOR THE FOUR- LEGGED ANIMALS, THEY CARRY KNIVES FOR THE TWO-LEGGED ANIMALS. 'CAUSE NOWADAYS IT'S A LOT LIKE THE OLD DAYS. YOU GOT A LOTTA WACKOS UP THERE, AND IT'S KNIVES THAT YOU WANT AT CLOSE QUARTERS. AND IF YOU CAN USE A KNIFE, THIS IS A BOWIE KNIFE, YOU CAN THROW A BOWIE KNIFE BUT IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM A THROWING KNIFE. SO THE BOWIE YOU KEEP FOR YOUR PERSONAL THINGS, LIKE THINGS YOU GOTTA DO AROUND THE CAMP AND STUFF LIKE THAT. THIS IS A THROWER. IT'S ALSO A STABBER FOR CLOSE-IN QUARTERS AND IT'S A THROWING KNIFE. AND IF YOU GET YOUR RANGE, MINE'S A SLOW, MINE'S A SHORT RANGE. IF I'M A FOOT OUT THIS WAY, I'M NO GOOD. BUT THE FARTHER YOU THROW A KNIFE, THE OPPONENT YOU'RE THROWING AGAINST HAS TIME TO SEE IT AND HE CAN MOVE OUT OF THE WAY. I USUALLY GO 10, 15 FEET, AND IF YOU GET A GOOD BALANCE, NOW WATCH, I'LL SCREW UP, BUT IF YOU GET A GOOD BALANCE ON THE KNIFE AND YOU GOT A GOOD THROWING KNIFE. I SWEAR BY MY KNIVES. THEY CAN LAUGH ALL THEY WANT, I SWEAR BY MY KNIFE. AND I NEVER MET ANY MAN WORTH HALF A SHIT UP IN THE MOUNTAINS THAT EVER LAUGHED. HE LOOKS AT THE KNIFE AND HE SAYS, "NICE KNIFE." THEN HE LOOKS AT THE MAKE OF THE KNIFE. AND THEN HE LOOKS AT IF YOU CAN USE THE KNIFE, AND THEN HE'S GOT RESPECT FOR YOU. SO I'LL TAKE MY KNIVES AND THEY CAN SNICKER AND LAUGH ALL THEY WANT.

AND HE'S JUST LOOKING AT ME. AND YOU CAN HEAR... [ Huffing heavily ] SWINGINING HIS HEAD BACK AND FORTH. AND HE'S WHACKING THE GROUND WITH HIS PAWS LIKE THIS HERE.

I HAVEN'T READ NOTHING ON GRIZZLY BEARS BUT FROM WHAT I'VE WATCHED FROM T.V. THEY SAY, "PLAY DEAD." AND I'M LAYING THERE AND I'M TRYING TO CON- TEMPLATE PLAYING DEAD, PLAYING DEAD POSSUM WITH THIS 400, 500 POUND GRIZZLY COMING OVER THERE AND RAKING ME WITH CLAWS AND TEETH. AND I SAID, "BULLSHIT, IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN." NOW, AS I'M STANDING HERE HE'S LOOKING RIGHT AT ME. AND THAT'S WHEN THE EYES HIT YOU. JUST BLACK WITHIN BLACK. JUST, JUST THE DEPTH IS UNBELIEVABLE. AND HE'S JUST EATING RIGHT INTO MINE. NOW, I COULD SEE THE RIFLE ON THE RIGHT- HAND SIDE OF ME FROM MY PERIPHERAL VISION, BUT HEY, YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE GRIZZLY BEAR AND I'M LOOKING AT THE GUN. BUT I CAN'T MAKE IT TO THE GUN. THERE'S NO WAY AND BESIDES, THAT LITTLE 22 ISN'T GOING TO DO NOTHING BUT PISS HIM OFF. SO WHAT DO YOU DO? ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS CALM COMES OVERTOP OF MY WHOLE BODY, JUST FLUSHES RIGHT THROUGH THE VEINS, JUST RIGHT OUT THE FEET. AND IT WAS JUST EUPHORIC, JUST BEAUTIFUL, BECAUSE I KNEW, RIGHT THEN, I'M GONNA DIE. SO WHAT I DO IS I DRAW A BLADE HALF OUTTA SHEATH, JUST LIKE THIS. NOW, HE DOESN'T SHOW WHETHER HE CATCHES THE INFRACTION OR NOT BUT I KNEW DAMN WELL HE CAUGHT IT. SO I'M LOOKING AT THIS BEAR, AND HE'S LOOKING AT ME, AND NO SOUND. HE'S NOT JAW POPPING. HE AIN'T SWINGING HIS HEAD, HE'S JUST LOOKING AT ME, JUST LIKE THIS. SO I DRAW. AND I'M STANDING THERE. AND I LOOK AND I SAY, "ALL RIGHT, OLD MAN, YOU'RE GONNA KILL ME SURE AS I'M STANDING HERE, BECAUSE YOUR FIGHTING PROWESS IS 50 TIMES MINE, AND I KNOW I'M GONNA DIE. BUT I AM SO PISSED OFF WITH ALL THE BULLSHIT YOU'VE PUT ME THROUGH, I'M GONNA TAKE BOTH OF THESE BEFORE I GO DOWN, SURE AS GOD MADE LITTLE GREEN APPLES, AND I'M GONNA SHOVE 'EM RIGHT UP YOUR ASS AND THAT'S A FACT." AND I JUST STOOD THERE. AND WE WAITED. AND IT WAS LIKE TIME STOOD STILL. AND HE LOOKS, AND HE GOES LIKE THIS. JUST LIKE THIS. SIDE TO SIDE. AND I SWEAR TO GOD, IF A BEAR COULD SMILE, HE COULD DO THAT. AND IT WAS LIKE, YEAH, OKAY, I CAN SEE WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM. HE TURNS AROUND, A FULL 180 DEGREES AND HE JUST WALKS AWAY. IT WAS THE SUN THAT HIT ME, AND IT WAS LIKE YOU JUST WOKE UP OUT OF THIS, THIS NIGHTMARIC STATE, AND YOU'RE LOOKING AROUND AND YOU'RE SAYING, "WHOO." AND THERE'S MY GUN AND THE SLUICE AND THE BACK, AND MY PACK IS SITTING OVER THERE, AND MY KNIVES ARE LIKE THIS, AND I'M JUST, WOW.
