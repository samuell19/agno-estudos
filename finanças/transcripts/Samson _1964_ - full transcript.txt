Laila! - Yes, my Queen. - Where is the kid? Why are you smiling? Answer my question. Where is the kid? Forgive my impertinence, my queen. Nobody gets married in Husnabad. Then where will we get kids from? I am not asking about your kid but about the goat kid. He one which we have brought from the forest. - Ustad Rashid has returned it. - Returned it? Why? And whom did he return it to? A man called Samson came from the forest. To ask for the goat's kid. And Ustad Rashid returned it. How did a man dare to enter Husnabad? Instead of catching him and throwing him.. To the dreadful creature, why did the Ustad.. Return to him the kid? Ms. Queen, he was not an ordinary man. We tried our best to stop and catch him. But nobody could overpower him. He broke down the strong gate of.. The royal palace with a single blow. Thank god that Ustad Rashid returned him that kid. Otherwise he might have caused havoc. Don't blabber. - Prepare my chariot. - But my queen... Laila, don't try to speak when I don't want to hear anything. Save me! Save me! - Thank you. - Who are you? I am queen Sheba from Husnabad. - And who are you? - I am Samson. So you are Samson. It seems the praised I have heard for you are all true. - You are really brave. - Thanks. I am not used to be praised. Tell me, how can I help you? I have come to fetch that goat kid.. That Rashid had returned to you. I am sorry, you cannot get it back. Speak properly! Stay away from me. I haven't moved a bit. You came to me. Jungle men. You stink like an animal. Aren't I stinking now? This is good. You are coming close and going far of your own accord. You are scared and still trying to show how grand you are. What do you want? Samson! I have told you what I wanted. If I don't get back the goat kid I will set fire to your forest. Sheba! You should have thought before saying so. - Who are you and what is your status? - Samson! Silence! Just think. You have a small life. A small body. Small hands. Thin fingers. I pity you. I want you to go back to your place safe and sound. Otherwise if a beast attacks you.. This queen will vanish without a trace. Go. Go back. I will go back. But you will have a problem. I am very thirsty. Get me some water. Okay. Queen Sheba! Queen Sheba! One safeguards their own honor, my queen. If you could have sought Ustad Rashid's advice.. Before going there you wouldn't have failed. I don't need advice. I want to be avenged. You will be avenged for sure.. But you need to wait for that. I can't wait. Laila! Laila! Yes, my queen. Order the cavalry to arrest Samson.. - And bring him to me. - But my queen! Carry out my orders. My queen. The poison is here, my queen. This poison is so potent that no one in the world.. Can tell its taste, because he dies before he could speak. My queen, one attack from this and he will be killed. But to tell the truth you don't even need to attack him. Just pierce him with it and he will dead. No, Laila. I don't want to kill him so soon. I will not kill him so easily. My queen, Samson has been arrested. And being presented to you. Laila, what is this stench? Is it some animal? Oh it's you. Such a huge body. Strong body. A torso like a stone wall. Everything is big. But you still have a small life. If I even scratch you with the poisoned blade.. Then this Samson will die without a trace. God decided life and death and not men. If I am destined to live than no force one earth can kill me. Aren't you scared of death? I wouldn't have come here, if I was scared of death. You haven't come here voluntarily. You have been forced to come here. If you think that your girls have caught me.. And brought me here than that is wrong. What do you mean? I mean to say that I didn't want to kill these innocent girls. That's why I volunteered my arrest and came here. Otherwise these iron shackles cannot hold Samson. - I find them just like grass. - That's false. Samson never lies. You are always with you your devotee. And I have your strength. Oh God! I came here to meet you. I wanted to ask you why you are after me. What do you want from me? But I am sorry that my motive was not completed. Because you yourself don't know what you want from me. Well. Goodbye. Take him away. Aag, show Ustad your powers. Well done. Hawa, show him your powers too. Well done! Well done! Very good! - Ustad Rashid. - Hail him. - Ustad Rashid. - Hail him. Ustad Rashid is still proud of his strength. We can turn the entire world into ashes.. With our friend Aag. And with my friend Paani we can immerse.. The entire world with water. And our friend Hawa will help us to create huge storms. Sorry for my impertinence, Ustad. But I think with my help you should kill the queen.. And take over the rule Husnabad. I still rule over Husnabad. But I will keep queen Sheba alive till.. We find her lost brother prince Salukh. Is he still alive, sir? He is surely alive. That old slave who ran away with him 20 years ago.. Would have kept him safer than his own life. And once we have found price Salukh.. All our problems will be resolved. Listen to me again and look at the royal coat of arms. If you see anyone bearing this symbol on his back.. Then he is prince Salukh whom you need to arrest.. And bring him at once to me. "Convince me that I can't be yours." "Convince me that I can't be yours." "My eyes and heart are still yearning." "Convince me." "I became restless when I heard you coming." "I became restless when I heard you coming." "When I heard you coming." "I feel at rest when I saw you." "Convince me that I can't be yours." "My eyes are still yearning." "Your love is kind but what do I do? "Your love is kind but what do I do?" "But what do I do?" "My life is to be smitten by you." "Convince me that I can't be yours." "My eyes are still yearning." "My heart is in my body otherwise often in the moonlight." "My heart is in my body otherwise often in the moonlight." "Otherwise often in the moonlight." "It has made you sit beside me and combed your hair." "My eyes and heart are still yearning." "Convince me that I can't be yours." "Convince me." Laila! Laila! Laila, where did you learn these love songs from? My queen, you cannot learn love songs. They get imbibed into you. Because my queen love cannot be separated.. From a person's life. So do you think that even I will fall in love? My queen, you are already in love. Me, in love? With whom? - With Samson. - Samson? Laila, I am happy that you have given me a chance to laugh. But I don't understand one thing.. How did you accept my hatred as love? My queen, how can I tell you the slim difference.. Between hatred and love? When love can turn into hatred and vice versa.. Cannot be understood easily. It seems strange but interesting. My queen, sometimes love even starts with hatred. See for yourself. You use to hate Samson at first. But now you love him. If you wished you could have killed him.. With the poisonous knife but you didn't do that. If you wanted you could have cut off his limbs.. But you didn't do that. And that is because my queen you don't want him... - And that's why I love him. - Yes, my queen. But love is prohibited for me. Ustad Rashid says that the day I fall in love with a man.. Lord Mukkadas will curse Husnabad. You? You have come again. Sheba, come. Samson, you shouldn't come here frequently. I don't know what happens to me when you come here. I am not able to think straight. A storm rises in my heart. A hurricane. You are laughing! And I am screaming like mad. Go away from here! Go. Go. My queen! My queen! My queen! What was that Laila? What was it? Don't worry, my queen? When love remains incomplete.. It expresses itself as madness. All this false. I am not in love with Samson. And if I am in love with Samson then I will destroy it. I will erase the name of Samson from my life. My queen! But I can't forget Samson till he is alive. But once Samson is dead, even my love for him will die. No, my queen a man's death doesn't kill his love. Love is immortal. Save me! Save me! You? There was storm last night, right? Yes, my queen, there was huge storm last night. What are you thinking? Nothing. I want to go now. Come, I will see you off. Nothing. Just sprained my foot. "I need to tell you something." "Let me speak with my eyes." "I need to tell you something." "Let me speak with my eyes." "Restlessness will increase so leave it." "I need to tell you something." "Let me speak with my eyes." "My love, don't eye this crazy man." "You are my lover and my darling." "Don't stare down a crazy lover, O dear." "You are my lover and my darling." "But if you don't understand me then." "I need to tell you something." "Let me speak with my eyes." "Restlessness will increase so leave it." "I need to tell you something." "Let me speak with my eyes." "The nice breeze and wind." "Restlessness adds fun in love." "The nice breeze and wind." "Restlessness adds fun in love." "Come and tell me the story of love." "I need to tell you something." "Let me speak with my eyes." "Restlessness will increase so leave it." "I need to tell you something." "Let me speak with my eyes." "The season is filled with colors of love." "The season stopped when it saw us." "The season is filled with colors of love." "The season stopped when it saw us." "And if the season also considers us to be crazy." "I need to tell you something." "Let me speak with my eyes." "Restlessness will increase so leave it." "I need to tell you something." "Let me speak with my eyes." The queen has returned to the palace. Please excuse my impertinence. Laila has been seen with a strange man. With a stranger? Go. What will happen now, Salukh? Don't worry. Nobody can hurt you till I am here. I am not worried about myself Salukh. We have to leave. Because only men are punished for crimes in Husnabad. - Please leave at once. - No, Laila. I have decided today. I am not leaving without you. Why don't you understand, Salukh? It's about your life. Rashid will arrest you, Salukh. - Leave from here. At once. - No, Laila. No. - I cannot leave you. - Salukh, for the sake of my love. Salukh, for Laila's sake, go away. Laila! You here. Arrest her. Take her away. Set the fire. He should escape. Set the fire. Unlucky girl, you did a commit a mistake. But you are a woman and women are protected.. By Lord Mukkadas. If a man was not present in a woman's life.. She would have never committed the crime. Not you but that young man is responsible.. For your crime who has egged you on. Tell me, who was that man who came to meet you? Speak girl. Why are you silent? That young man is the real culprit. And you know where that culprit is. If you refuse to tell us his whereabouts.. Then how will the culprit be punished? Don't you know where he is? Don't you know who he is and where he stays? I do but I won't tell you. Do you know the outcome? Outcome. I also know the outcome. I am in love, Ustad Rashid. And if it is a crime to love.. - Than I will commit this crime again and again. - Laila! Laila is a woman. And a woman is bound to love. That is false. I don't want you to decided what is true and what is false. Even the queen cannot decide against the law of Husnabad. I leave this decision on you, my queen. Because you are a woman and only woman can understand another woman. Laila! My queen, isn't it true that a woman's life.. Starts and ends in love? My queen, is it false that love is the biggest strength.. And the biggest weakness in a woman's life? My queen, if love is removed from a woman's life.. Then what is left in it? Please decide, my queen. Why are you silent? Decision. Lord Mukkadas will decide. Lord Mukkadas, only you have the right to decide.. Against a woman in this chaste land of women. This accused girl who is standing in front of you.. With a bowed head want you to decide. If you want me to forgive her than shower rain. And if you want to punish her then shower fire. Lord Mukkadas has decided. Take her away. And this unlucky girl will be thrown in front of.. The scary beast at sunrise tomorrow. My queen! You didn't need to exert yourself for your maid, my queen. Laila, you are my special maid. I will miss you a lot. That's why I have come to tell you to stop being stubborn. And tell us the name of that unlucky young man.. Who had come to break the laws of Husnabad. Thank you for your advice, my queen. But I am no so selfish that to save my own life.. I will not endanger my lover's life. I am helpless, my queen. The lover you are risking your life for.. Should also care for you. My queen I cannot tell you how much he loves me. If I had not made him swear on my life and love.. Then he would have never left me. All women are fooled when they are blindfolded by love. If I am being fooled, my queen.. Than I wish to be a fool for evermore. May I get a thousand such live.. Which I can sacrifice for my lover. Laila! I pray that even you are blindfolded by love. So that instead of seeing this hard cruel world.. You are able to see that glorious world of love.. Which is already there in your heart. - My heart? - Yes, my queen. Instead of being in this wonderful world.. You are struggling in a world with darkness everywhere. You're like the lost traveller in a desert .. Who has never seen greenery. You are hungry and thirsty since you have grown up. - Laila! - Laila is about to die, my queen. That's why she has become so brave. After hearing this you can punish me even further. But today I need to tell you that the rules.. Of your kingdom is against human nature. This kingdom is a sand castle who has empty foundations. And remember that no one will be able.. To save it from the hurricane of love. No one. Neither Ustad Rashid nor Lord Mukkadas. Laila! Laila! Laila! Who are you? I am Salukh. I had come to meet Laila yesterday. - Laila is innocent. - Salukh! Salukh! What have you done, Salukh? I made you swear. Ustad. Ustad. He is innocent. I had gone to meet him. He is lying. Forgive him. No, he is lying. I had come to meet her. And I am the culprit. Arrest him. He is the real criminal. So Laila should be released. He will have to face the beast. No! No! My queen. No, my queen. No, my queen. Salukh is completely innocent. It is not his fault. I promise you. He won't break your law anymore. Forgive him. Why don't you speak? Why are you silent? Say something, my queen. The queen cannot do anything even if she wants to. The one who has broken the law will be punished. Will be punished? Laila, I am helpless. Helpless? If you are helpless then why are you a queen? If you cannot forgive anyone then.. - Why are you sitting on the throne? - Laila! Take away this insolent girl so that she can disrupt our justice. No, my queen. Salukh is innocent. Let him go. He is innocent. Let Salukh go, my queen. - Salukh! Let him go. - Laila. He is innocent. Salukh. My queen, this is cruelty. Samson! Samson! The enemy used to be at bay till ferocious beast was alive. His death has hurt our strength. Friendship has lessened. Enmity has increased. Forgive my impertinence, sir. We don't lack of friends. Kaladev, who is more powerful than.. Ferocious beast is under your control. It can kill Samson in a moment. Well done, Dokiya. Very good idea. Kaladev. - Kaladev. - Yes. - What do you want? - Freedom. - Will you follow my order? - I will. - Will you kill the person I want you to kill? - I will. Then go. Go and kill Samson in the forest. You will be freed as soon as he is dead. Go! Sir, he is dead. No problem. - We still have a stronger... - Dokiya! We will have to use our brains instead of strength now. - Got it? - Hail my lord. Queen Sheba is going outside. She is surely going to meet Samson. Let her go. If all targets want to be trapped together then let them. Everyone will be killed by Rashid with just one move. I am alone in this huge kingdom, Samson. Rashid had enchanted everyone into listening to him. - No one listens to me. - Don't worry, Sheba. Rashid's enchantment will go against him. And he will be exposed to the world. Liars will be shamed and the truthful will be heard. Hatred will end. And love will smile. - Love's smile? - Yes, my queen. Excuse me my impertinence. You two are strangers in the world of love. That's why you didn't see the show of nature.. Which effected the patients of love. Love! "Don't ask me, what I saw in love." "Don't ask me, what I saw in love." "Don't ask me, what I saw in love." "Don't ask me." "Don't ask me." "What I saw in love." "I saw the show enacted by God's nature." "I saw the show enacted by God's nature." "What did I see in the face of the pretty girls?" "What did I see?" "Ask me, what did I see?" "What did I see?" "I saw the show enacted by God's nature." "I saw the show enacted by God's nature." "Everyone just tells the tale of love for namesake." "Tale of love." "Tale of love." "Only loves tell you who is loyal." "Only love tells you." "I saw every unveiled face." "Don't ask me, what I saw in love." "I saw the show enacted by God's nature." "As if I was being resurrected by a voice." "By a voice. By a voice." "The world changes according to your outlook." "According to your outlook." "The one whom I though was the killer.. Proved to be the savior." "What did I see in the face of the pretty girls?" "I saw the show enacted by God's nature." "You try to be smart and strong." "But as soon as you get a glimpse you become nervous." "Where is your heart lost?" "Lost. Where is your heart lost?" "The lips are blossoming." "Blossoming. The lips are blossoming." "A face was also engulfed with desires." "We even saw some desires in your eyes." "Don't ask me, what I saw in love." "I saw the show enacted by God's nature." "I speak what I've seen." "Then what is false?" "If it is a flower it will emit fragrance." "Of it is an ember it is bound to kindle." "Look at your own behavior." "Look. Look at your own behavior." "Look at the mirror." "Look. Look at the mirror." "You have got such a face." "How are the eyes to be blamed?" "Darling, I saw you as you are." "When love lived in my heart, everything fell into place." "This is small miracle of love." "Forget flowers. Even thorns look pretty." "Even thorns look pretty." "Even thorns look pretty." "The one where we looked with love is my darling." "That's my darling." "The one whom I thought was a stranger.. Proved to be a close one." "Don't ask me, what I saw in love." "I saw the show enacted by God's nature." Look at this. Poison from 21 different poisonous snakes. Forget having it. Men will die even after touching it. Very good. Samson's death will be the death of Rashid's biggest enemy. And Salukh's death will be Rashid's life. My queen! You want to ask me where I was. Right? - I had gone to meet Samson. - I know. Now you will ask me, why did I go? I will only tell you that it was important for me to go there. Isn't it my duty to thank the person.. Who freed Husnabad from the ferocious beast. This was not only yours but the entire nation's duty. But you didn't need to go there for that. I will decide what I need to do and what I don't. It is not enough for you to go there and thank him. - We should have done more for him. - What? Rashid has done what needed to be done. I have invited Samson and Salukh on behalf of Husnabad. There will be a huge celebration in their honor. And we will entertain and thank the two brave men. What are you saying? Rashid always tells the truth. A friend is not always a friend. And an enemy is also never always an enemy. Strange! "Darling we have become crazy after looking into your eyes." "Darling we have become crazy after looking into your eyes." "When I tried to control myself I lost myself even more." "When I tried to control myself I lost myself even more." "Though I am not but am still fragrant with your love." "I became good wine." "I became good wine when I saw your eyes, darling." "Darling we have become crazy after looking into your eyes." "We have become crazy." "When I looked into your eyes my beating heart hurt me." "When I looked into your eyes my beating heart hurt me." "When I tried to heal it, the heart set me on fire." "I became very restless." "I became very restless, when I saw your eyes, darling."

"There is no one like me in this world." "You can listen to a thousand tales." "I had a lot of lovers, but I am still crazy about you." "I became everyone's answer." "Darling I became everyone's answer.. After looking into your eyes." "Darling we have become crazy after looking into your eyes." "We have become crazy." Brave Samson. And young Salukh. The queen is very pleased with your bravery. That's why she wants to honor you by offering.. This Mukkadas water from Lord Mukkadas. Please have it. I only believe in my god. But on the interest of other people's beliefs.. I accept the water from Lord Mukkadas. Stop Salukh! Let me have it first. You tried to kill me after inviting me to the royal palace. Then in the jungle. And today you tried to poison me with Mukkadas water. - Come Salukh. - Samson! - Samson! - My queen! Get out of my way! Samson! Samson! Samson! I am innocent, Samson. Ustad Rashid is responsible for this. I assure you that I punish Rashid harshly. - Samson! Don't you believe me? - Come Salukh. - Samson! Samson! - My queen. My queen. You are the queen of Husnabad It doesn't befit you running after a layman like crazy. Rashid, I arrest you on the charges of trying.. To poison 2 men with Mukkadas water. - Orders should be followed. - They won't be. Why not? I am the queen here. I am the priest of Lord Mukkadas. I neither believe in Lord Mukkadas or his priest. Now I believe in only one god, the god of love. There is god but the god of love. Otherwise no god. Love is god and god is love. Sheba, don't say so. Lord Mukkadas will be angry with you. - I don't care. - Sheba! My queen! My queen! My queen! My queen! My queen, our settlements have caught fire. All water has dried up but the fire is not getting extinguished. He queen has started this fire. It won't be extinguished by water. Please save our property otherwise we will all ruin you. We will destroy the one who destroyed us. Come. Stop. This is the queen. There is no time to think now my queen. Say sorry to Lord Mukkadas immediately. No, I haven't committed any mistake. - I haven't committed any mistake. - Queen. - I haven't committed any mistake. - Stop. I am sorry for the queen's mistake. Lord Mukkadas will surely help us. She will not punish his innocent subjects.. For the queen's mistake. He will be kind enough to rain us with benevolence. Pray with me. Lord Mukkdas. Forgive the queen. Shower us with your benevolence! Shower us with your benevolence! Shower us with your benevolence! - Ustad Rashid! - Hail him. - Ustad Rashid! - Hail him. - Ustad Rashid! - Hail him. - Ustad Rashid! - Hail him. - Ustad Rashid! - Hail him. - Ustad Rashid! - Hail him. - Ustad Rashid! - Hail him. May the queen always rule. Don't worry about all this. The queen no longer rules, Laila. Today the queen has become Rashid's puppet, Laila. Don't say so. Rashid rules Husnabad and not Sheba. It seems that even Lord Mukkadas... Lifeless stone idols can neither be owned.. Nor can they own anyone. Rashid is actually strengthening himself.. By saying it's Lord Mukkadas. Yes, my queen, I have come to warn you. Rashid is not your friend but your enemy. He has made Samson hate you so that he doesn't help you. So that he can achieve what he wants. Why don't you tell this to your friend, Samson? I have already convinced Samson, my queen. Now I have come to convince you. Salukh - My queen. You have responsibilities as a queen. Try to understand your responsibilities. And don't think that you are alone. Both me and Samson are with you. And since you are true, even God is there with you. - Good bye. - Catch him. The victim has been caught. Arrest him. I have found you after 20 years. I will cut you into pieces. What are you doing here? Go. Go and bring prince Salukh to me, alive or dead. Go. I haven't come here to fight with you. But I have come here to strike a deal, Samson. - Deal? - Yes. The world says I'm evil. Everybody wants to live a life of comfort.. Irrespective of whether their intentions are good or bad. Everyone wants to lead a life of comfort and respect. Even I want that. And that's why the bad has come to strike a deal with good. I didn't understand you. You have physical strength but no brains. I don't brains which lead people into wrong paths. Destroy humanity and rob of their goodness. You are not human but a devil. Not I but you are the devil, Samson. You had disrupted the peace of Husnabad. You have taught the people there to cry and to be in pain. Nobody had dared to even mention love till date in Husnabad. But Husnabad's peace was disrupted as soon as you entered. You had destroyed the world.. I had taken 20 years to create. Why? What did I do to you that you wasted all my efforts? Wrong! I have done nothing of that sort. In fact you have killed millions of men.. Who used to live in Husnabad. Killed humane emotions. Rashid, god has not given you power and honor.. For you to be cruel to his subjects. - What do you want? - I don't want anything. God has given me everything. You tell me. Why have you come to me? I have come to tell you to move out from my path. Stop supporting my enemies. And in return if you want you can also take.. The Queen of Husnabad, Sheba. But you will have to take her far away. Husnabad is mine. I want it to be mine always. Rashid, Husnabad will always belong to its rightful rulers. I have decided not to let you live in peace. Bad and good has never reached a compromise. Think about it again, Samson. I have told you what I wanted to. - So is this your final decision? - Yes. Do you know the outcome? Rashid, truth never fears outcomes. I will see you. Salukh! Salukh dear! Lord Mukkadas, I have come to complain to you today. If you are light then why are we in darkness? Why is love a sin for us? Why does fire start whenever.. A woman of Husnabad falls in love? Why is there a storm? My queen! My queen! What is the matter, Laila? I was praying to Lord Mukkadas. When Ustad Rashid entered.. The prayer room like a thief. I hid. Ustad Rashid moved towards the lord's idol.. And then he disappeared suddenly. Strange! I don't think this is Lord Mukkadas' doing. Even I doubt Rashid. My queen, even I doubt him. Brother, no matter what you say. I am sure the queen was also part of the plan.. Of poisoning you. - That is impossible. - Danger! Danger! We have been sent by Sheba, Queen of Husnabad. Why? Does she want to poison him again? Rashid is troubling the queen a lot. So Rashid has stooped so low. But how can we believe that queen Sheba has sent you? Please take this ring as a symbol.
