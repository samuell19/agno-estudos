Our story begins in a time long, long ago... deep in an enchanted forest on the distant moon of Endor. Cindel! Mace! Cindel! Mace, can you hear me? Cindel! Mace! - Did you find them? - No. Not a sign. Every day since the crash, you've told them not to leave the ship. I told them too. I knew we shouldn't have left them alone... not even for a minute, just to go find that transmitter. They're only little kids. They won’t know what to do. They don't even know where we are. I'll check the cruiser again. Oh, Jeremitt, what's happened to them? I told them not to leave the ship. Mace! Please, Mace. We're not mad at you! Catarine, look. Cindel's jacket. I hope she's kept her life monitor on. Where are those two? We'll find them. We'll find them. In an Ewok village on the moon of Endor... Deej tries to summon two of his sons... who have went into the woods and have not returned. - He fears they may be lost. Shodu. Shodu. Deej, Shodu. Deej. Deej. Nuv, nuv, nuv, nuv. - Yeha. - Yeha, Shodu. Deej will use his skin glider to search for his missing sons. Deej. Is told he must stay behind. Shodu. - Acha? - Acha. Gunda, wicket. Gunda. - Hmm? Yeha, wicket. Yeha. Object in the trees below. But anxious to find his missing children... he continues the search. Widdle! weechee! Widdle. weechee. Tyatee. Gunda! - Feech. Tyatee. Tyatee! On their way home, the inquisitive Ewoks... decide to investigate the strange object... Deej spotted from the sky. Tyatee, weech. widdle! Hmm. Gunda beecha. Gunda. Acha, beecha, acha. Deej! Get your hands off her! No, Mace, no! - Be quiet, Cindel. - They weren’t hurting me. These might be the guys who have Mom and Dad. I think they wanna be our friends. Get your hands off her now! That's it, mop-face! Don't hurt him. He's my brother. Hey, you guys can't keep me down. - Wicket! - Deej. - Shodu. Lurdo. Tyatee. - Shodu. Gunda. Gunda! Cindel, are you okay? Mace, I don't feel good. Maybe you're just hungry. You know, we haven't eaten for awhile. Do you... Do you guys have anything to eat? Kush? Any food? Food. Eat, eat. Food. Eat, eat. Food. - Chak. - Uh-huh. Come on, Cindel. You gotta eat something. I'm not hungry. I just feel bad. I don't feel so good. Cindel, are you okay? - Cindel! Cindel. Cindel! Cindel, can you hear me? I wish Dad was here. He'd know what to do. Dad? We don't need any more food. -we don't need any more. - It's medicine? - Chak. Gunda. Gunda. I sure hope this works. Come on, Cindel. You gotta be all right. Beecha. Cindel, please. I want Mommy. Where's Mommy? Take it easy. Just... Just get some rest now. We’ll worry about finding Mommy after you're all better. Widdle! weechee! Feech. - I want my mommy. Lurdo! - Mace. - Hey, Sis. How you feeling? Feeling a lot better? It hurts, Mace. - Hurts? what hurts? - Everything. I wish Mommy was here, and she'd take care of me. Don’t worry. I'll take care of you, Cindel. Mommy's just not here right now. Mommy and Daddy, where did they go, Mace? Why did they leave us? I don't know. - Where's the medicine? - Medicine? - We need some more medicine. - Medicine. Mace, help me. Hold on, Cindel. We need more medicine. She needs more medicine. - Look at her. We need some more medicine. - Kush jeeks? We need more medicine. We need more of this. - You're out? - Den! Den! Den! Can we go get some more? She's sick. I feel so hot. Hold on, Sis. - Tyatee! - Me? You want me to go? We're gonna get you some more medicine. Then you'll feel better. Okay? Please. It hurts. Come on. Let's go. One tree in the primeval forest... contains a special fluid which only Ewoks know. They have used it for generations to cure their ills. Tyatee. Ah, gunda. Oh! Help! - Help! - Tyatee! Help me! Help! Help! Lurdo! - Thank you. I feel really sicky. Don’t worry, Sis. We got you some more medicine. Yeah, sick. Hmm, sick. Here, Cindel. See? Everything's gonna be all right. Don’t worry. We got you enough medicine now to make you feel well. I feel a little better already. - Good. It's okay. Don't... Don’t worry about me. The thing in that tree didn't hurt me that bad. Acha. Just take care of my sister. - Furry. - Kush? - Furry. Furry. - Hmm. Furries? - Yeah. I wish we had furry creatures like you where I came from. Furries? We came on a Star cruiser and we crashed. We crashed? Star cruiser? - Star cruiser. That's it. Star cruiser. Star cruiser? Star cruiser. And it crashed. Crashed? Crashed. Star cruiser crashed. Yeah, that's it. Don't you have a Star cruiser? Star cruiser? Hmm. Star cruiser. whee! - Crash! Crash! Crash! - That's not a Star cruiser. That's a horse. [Making Aeroplane Noises, Crashing Noise] - Horses don't fly. - Fly? - Good morning. - Good morning, Mace. Hey, Sis. You look a lot better this morning. I feel much better. What were you guys talking about? About the Star cruiser and the crash. Come on, Cindel. Get an I.Q. He can't talk. - He can talk. - Talk. Talk. Star cruiser. Crash! Crash! Crash! See? Listen. As soon as I get my gun, we're history. we’re out of this place. Why can’t we stay herewith them? Stay herewith these walking hairbrushes? Come on, Cindel. They're animals. No, they're not. I like 'em. Star crash. Cruiser fly. Come on, Cindel. Let's go. We gotta go find Mom and Dad. - I don't wanna go. - Come on, Cindel. Come on, Sis. We're almost there. Mace, we’re lost. Lost? we’re not lost. It's right up there. I know it. Please, can we rest? I'm tired. I guess so. But I'd better build a fire. Don’t wanna catch cold. - Mace. - Yeah? Do you ever miss Mommy and Daddy? Of course I do. Then why don't you talk about them then? 'Cause I don’t wanna make you feel bad. I miss them a lot. So do I. I know l-I've been a lot of trouble. And I know Dad got really mad at me a couple times. I just wish I would have never done any thing wrong. I wish I had been the best kid there ever was. I just wish... Now I could tell them how I feel. Tell them I love them. If we just wouldn't have left there... left the cruiser... maybe everything would be all right. Maybe if we would have done what they told us to do... Maybe every thing would be just like it was. Maybe they would still be alive. They are not dead! I told you. They are not dead. But it's been so long. Well, maybe they just got lost, or maybe... maybe it's a logway to go get help. Just don’t worry. We'll stay in the Star cruiser until... Until they get back. I will protect you. I will be Mom and Dad. Did you hear that? - Let's get outta here! Go on! Get out! Is it gone? Yeah, I think so. But we better spend the night. Just get some rest. Just get some rest. Tyatee. Tyatee. Hey, Cindel, look! Mace, that's Daddy's life monitor. Mommy and Daddy are alive! I told you. But where are they and why... why is this on this... this thing? -what is this? - Where did it come from? - Kush? Gorax. Mace must find the master of the beast... if they are ever to rejoin their parents. Life monitor still works, so we at least know that Dad's still alive. We just gotta figure out how to find them. Don’t worry. Don’t worry. Do you know what they're probably doing right now? They're probably sitting somewhere just like we are... thinking about us, missing us. How are we gonna find them? - We will. Don’t worry. - But when? Right now. - Kush? - Where did that animal come from? Where does it live? Someone must know where that came from. Someone must be able to help us. Chak, Chak. Logray. Chak. "Logray"? what is that? Logray. Logray. The village mystic, is as old as the trees. And he has the power to find the lost parents. Be careful with that. That's Dad! Where is that? What is it? That's Mommy and Daddy. What's that? It looks like a monster or something real big! Where is it? Where is it? If we don't help them, they're gonna die. Please help us. They're gonna die. I want my mommy and daddy. Deej. Deej. The mother and father of the children... are being held captive by the dreaded giant Gorax. And they know also that the giant Gorax lives in a land... from which no Ewok has ever returned. Deej. Hmm. Chak. We help you. Nuv! Nuv! Nuv! Nuv! Gunda! Nuv! Nuv! Gorax. Gundawicket. Shodu? Tyatee, Shodu. Tyatee. Acha. Acha. Don’t worry, Mom and Dad. We're coming. All the Ewok villagers helped load supplies... for the long journey. Tyatee! Tyatee! - Logray. - Tyatee, Deej. Tyatee. Wicket, widdle, weechee. Gather for a traditional Ewok ceremony. Before they depart, Logray must bestow upon them... the sacred totems of the legendary Ewok warriors. Deej, as leader, is presented with the white wings of hope. The redwings of courage are given to the eldest son, weechee. Wicket receives a magic walking stick. While the blue wings of strength go to his brother, widdle. Cindel, the candle of pure light. This must be mine. Eh! - I don’t want a rock. - Chak. Chak. Chak. The crystal and the ivory tooth. Who are those for? For other Ewoks who must be found... and persuaded to join the caravan. Without them, the travellers can never cross... the vast expanses of the Endor moon. Yeha, Logray. Yeha, Deej. A rock? These little bears are nuts. It's just another stupid rock. Hi, wicket. This is neat. Which one's my horse? I don’t wanna get in there. - I do not wanna get in there. That place is for kiddies. - I'd rather walk. Tyatee! Come on, you guys. This is a neat place. What? - Cindel! Oh. You're okay. You better watch out! You nearly killed us! I’m warning you. Chukha-Trok. Chukha-Trok. Logray. That's his? Does that mean he's coming with us? You gotta be kidding. Tyatee, Chukha-Trok. Hey, wait one minute here. You think we care if you're coming or not? Yeah, you might be big, you might be strong... but obviously you're no warrior. You're scared. That’s what you are. Watch this. Gunda, Chukha-Trok. Boy, I've never seen anything like that before. Can I have the tooth? Would you please come with us? We need you. Is returned to its rightful owner... the brave woodsman, Chukha-Trok. - Nuv, nuv, Chukha-Trok. He joins the caravan... on its journey to the forbidden land of the giant Gorax. ## [Chukha-Trok Singing In Ewokese] Why are we stopping? -why are we stopping? What's that? Hey, you’re wasting time. Kaink. Logray. The crystal belongs to Kaink, the Ewok priestess. But before she will join the caravan... they must pass a magic test. Tyatee. Tyatee. What the... So what? It turned into a lizard. Big deal. I don't think these guys are gonna help us, Sis. Come on. Let's get outta here. Could you please help us find our mommy and daddy? Kaink then agrees to go. The caravan is now complete. Here you go. Good one, wicket. Help! Help! Help! Help! My brother! My brother fell in the water. Please hurry! Help him! Please hurry! Help him! Wicket! wicket! Use the stick that the magic man gave you. The stick! The stick! Remember? Uh-huh, yeah. What happened? One minute, I was... I was right there. The next, I was... I was under the water. - Wicket saved you. - I know, and thanks. Come on, you guys. It's time to go. Let's get moving. - Get wicket. - Wicket! Get on your horses! We need to go after her! - Hyah! Hyah! They're here! They're back! You're safe! They're here! This sure is a good candle. It never burns down. Candle. Candle. Did you see that? Wicket, come here! Whisties! - What are these things? - Whisties. whisties. Whisties! whisties! Whisties. whisties. Whisties. whisties. Get away. Go! Get away! - Get away! Get away! Stop! - Whisties! Whisties. - Oh! Whisties, whisties. Huh? Hey, look what I got. It's... It's one of those lights. It's alive. It's one of those lights. Be careful with her. Look, she's dancing around like crazy. Maybe she's lost from her family. Like us. All our families are split up. Even wicket’s. His mom and his baby sister, they’re way back there. You gave up a lot to help us. You guys have become really good friends. Mace, I'm really hungry. I know, Cindel. I know. But we’re really running low on food. And I don't know how far we still have to go. Gunda. Gunda. - What's this stuff? - Gunda. Gunda. I wonder if she's hungry. I wonder what she eats. I don't know... but maybe she'll like wicket's food. Here we go. Come on. It tickles. She's tickling me! Whoa! I think she eats giggles. She's a giggle-eater! The Ewoks crossed the Desert of Salma... a land of acid pools and dry lakes. Forbidden fortress of the giant Gorax. There must be away up there somehow. Nothing here but rocks. -what do you mean? Oh, my rock! I threw it away. Oh! Lurdo! Oh! What is it, wicket? The rock! You picked it up! You saved it for me! Thank you. Ah, let's see. Now, what are we supposed to do with it? It's just a... plain old stupid rock. There's something inside of it. - What is it? - I don't know. There must be a cave behind that rock. That's impossible to move. It must weigh tons! Hey, give me my gun. I can blast it away. Acha, acha. You've still got some power left, don't you? Come on. You've got some power. Just a little. I know this really looks scary here... but this is what we're all gonna have to do to save Mom and Dad. What do you mean? So you think the little ones should stay here? Chak. Here. Here. Cindel, listen. I think he might be right. Well, I'll be scared without you. Cindel, listen. Mommy and Daddy would want you to be safe. I think you should stay here. I don’t want you to get hurt. Not to worry. They'll protect you. - Acha beecha. - Take care of her. Don’t worry. We'll be okay. - Take care of her. - Yeha. Now what? I think it's okay. Come on. It's just like climbing a ladder sideways. Aaah! Star cruiser. -whoosh, whoosh, whoosh! Star crash. It's okay. I made it. Come on! Huh? Watch out! Behind you! Come on. Hurry up! That was close. You guys are great! Wicket, be careful! - Come on. Get out of sight! There's my parents there in the cage. There must be away up there somehow. Now, how are we gonna get my parents down? I'm game. Mace? Mace. It's Mace. Shh! - What? what? - Look. Mace! Honey. Jump. Oh, Mace. I don't believe it! We gotta get out of here. - What is that? - He's a friend. Come on. Help him up. - Hurry! - I'm going down first. Mom, Dad, you follow. Be careful, honey. Be careful. Don’t worry. He'll help me down. - Boy! Gorax! Gorax! - Come on. - Gorax! Let's go! Let's get out of here! Come on! - Come on! Come on! Where's Mace? - Oh, no. - Oh, God! Mace! Mace! Go! Get him, Ezerina! Oh, no! Come on! Come on. You've gotta be all right. He's gonna be here. Come on. Come on. Come on. You've gotta be all right! Let's go! He's gonna come back! Come on! Come on. You can do it. You're brave. You're strong. You're my friend. Friend. Your axe? No, this is your axe. You're gonna need it. You're gonna need your axe. I won’t take it. No. No... No, please don't die! No! Goodbye. Thank you. Go! Uh-oh. Oh, honey! Mom! Dad! We thought we’d lost you. Chukha-Trok? Yes, he's dead. He died for all of us. Chukha-Trok. - Cindel! - Come on, Mommy and Daddy! We're coming. He crashed. - Ohh! Oh, Mace! Nuv! Nuv! - We thought you were dead. - Oh, darling! We just thought we weren't gonna ever see you guys again. Son, we’re very, very proud of you. Dad. - Ezerina's back. - She'll help us find our way back. - That sounds good. Let's get out of here. That's not the worst idea l ever heard. Well, I guess this is it. I mean, you've probably got a family somewhere else too. Thanks for everything. we really couldn't have done it without you. Goodbye. - Oh, thank you. Oh! why, thank you very much! - Gunda. We are two... very lucky fathers. - Cindel. - Wicket. Reunited, the families enjoy... the simple pleasures of being together... having learned something they already knew... that courage, loyalty and love... are the strongest forces in the universe.
