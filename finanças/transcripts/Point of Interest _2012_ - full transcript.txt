Aw, shit! Come on, big guy, let's go. I thought you said we were postponing. No, man, we're going. I changed my mind. Let's go! She stood you up again, didn't she. Alan, get in the car. Oh... - Bye, Rufus. - See ya later, Bud. What the hell is that thing? Is that a girl pillow? Nah, it's a guy's pillow. Man, it is chilly. It's a cool day. - It's a road trip day. - It's a road trip day. Road trip! So, what happened with Amy this time? Did she, uh... she blow you off again? No... I am playing hard to get. Oh - hard to get. I'm not going to call her for a little while, while I'm on the road trip. And then she's gonna come a-runnin'. - Is that your plan, huh? - Yes, sir. Hey, Shannon, I'm not trying to be a jerk or anything but... you're about as good at talking to girls as you are at reading maps. - All right, I'm just saying. - Okay. - You're gonna want to take a right... - Wait... that reminds me. Hold the wheel. - Just grab it. - Whoa, shit! Shannon... Check it out! - No. - Boom! But I'm the map guy. - Not any more. - I mean, I read the maps. - We got this thing. It's sweet! - What do we need GPS for? We got a perfectly good map right here. Ha, ha - that's a lot better than a map. Shannon, it's no fun if you have a computer telling you where to go. It takes away the adventure. (laughs) We're gonna have an adventure. - Put it on. - Okay... Just don't come crying to me when machines take over the world. (zapping sound) - Oh. - Oh. Please enter point of interest. - Huh. - Nice! Fancy. Not going to need this anymore. (sighs) Wanna go halvsies? Yeah. Want the bottom or the top? Top. Oh, you're a top guy. All right. Makes sense. In twenty yards, turn left. Thank you, Rhonda. Rhonda? Yeah, I liked her voice. - So you named it. - Uh-huh. All right, whatever. I like your voice too, Shannon. (both) Holy shit! - Do it again, do it again. - All right, all right, all right. I like your screen, Rhonda. I like your face, Shannon. That's incredible! Are you doing that? No, it's just doing that. - Can they do that now? Bizarre! - Yeah. - Okay, um, let me try, let me try. - Okay. Rhonda. I think... that you're hot. Turn right at intersection. (Shannon laughing) Oh - she likes me better! Well, I don't know if I like it. It's weird it's like one of those... You remember Foobies? What? Those weird things, they record your voice and they say it back to you? Yeah, I don't think they were called Foobies, Shan. Foo-oo-oo... Foobies Okay, you know what, I'm not cool with this talking machine. I'm going to give you a little nap, Rhonda, and... -Wait... - We're good (sighs) Well, that was unsettling. I was hoping you'd turn me on. Me too. How may I make your trip more pleasurable? What? What can I do for you on this long, hard, lonely road? (moaning) Ah... oh, yeah. Please merge back onto highway. (moaning) Oh, this feels really good. - Ah... ah! - Please merge back onto highway. Yeah, I'm gonna merge so hard... Ho... Oh, God. I can't believe I did that. Oh, my God. Oh, God, what a... Oh, fuck - that's my dick hand! Ewww! (eerie electronic noises) Ugh... grandmas... old people hanging out playing checkers. Yeah. Okay, that's good. Ahhh... Eee-aaaa! Phew... Okay, act cool. Act like you know what you're doing. What? It muh... it moved, man. What moved? That thing... ... to watch you pee. It was watching me pee? It's not a good thing, ya pervball. It was... was moving about like it was scanning us. You gotta get rid of it. I'm not gonna get rid of it 'cause you had a wet dream about me peeing. I was not wet dreaming. I was awake, all right? You gotta believe me. - You're acting like a baby. - I'm not a baby. - With your drool and your baby cheeks over there. - I don't have baby cheeks. Yes, you do. Let's just go. Let's get you some food. Some Gerber's, some caffeine... ...a bottle. I'm gonna go get some gummy bears. You wanna come in? Do you want me to get you something? A bagel... with cream cheese. Yeah? You got it. Hey, the strawberry kind. Sounds good. Strawberry kind... (dramatic music) Okay. I don't know what you are.... but I was totally awake and I totally saw you move. So what's your game, anyway? I am going to take you down. Robot. No one will ever believe you. (angry scream) Hey, man, they didn't have any of the... Alan? Alan, what are you doing? Alan, what... ? What the... ? Hey! What the hell? I am done, all right? I am done! I am not getting back in the car with that thing. What are you talking about? It's doing some weird, freaky AI shit. It's been programmed to kill, It's the devil, I don't know. I just know that wherever you got the thing, you gotta get rid of it. No! No! This thing was the deal of a century I'm not getting rid of it. I'm not an idiot, Shannon, I know why you're keeping that thing around. Because it's got a girl's voice, and it saying nice stuff to you. Do you have give any idea how sad that is? You're jealous. You're jealous 'cause it likes me more than you, aren't you? Yeah! Congratulations Shannon, you finally found a girlfriend. It's a plastic box with lips. Fine. Shannon... Fine. Come on... - Fine. - Where you going? Shannon... Jeez! Man, look - I didn't mean it. Oh, you meant it! You know what? Fine - go. You know what? You're pathetic. Yeah, yeah, y... You are stupid! Shannon. Bear left in 50 feet. I'm proud of you, Shannon. Not now, Rhonda. But, Shannon... Not now! Recalculating... - Turn right, now. - Um... - Turn right now! - Okay! Okay! This doesn't look right. Uh... this seems kind of weird. You have reached your final destination. My what? Don't be afraid, Shannon. What do you want? I want your body. You horny box of lips. What is this, a joke? I don't want to hurt you, Shannon. But I will. (door locks clicking) What the hell? What's going on? I need your body. You broken or something? Stop it! Give me your body! (sceaming) Ahhhh! (electronic zapping) Ahhhh! Ohmigod, ohmigod! You... are a vessel! (inaudible) (screaming) God! Who are you! What are you doing? Oh! (unintelligible) Ow... let go! No, let go of me! Holy shit! Ahhhh! Ahhhh! (screaming) Ahhhh! Oh, my God! (gagging) (choking) Let him go, skank! Trip's been cancelled... Bitch. (screeching) (sighs) - Why'd it have arms? - What? Why'd it have... how'd it get arms? Why did that have arms, Shannon?! What the hell? - Oh, my God, it had arms! - How did you find that? I don't know! - It was trying to steal my soul! - What? - Yeah, it said I was a vessel! - Oh! Oh! A vessel! Oh, my God it tried to rape my mind! Why did it do that? Why did you do that? (sobbing) - I want to go home! - You came in the nick of time! - You came in the nick of time! (Alan shrieks) You were right. I know. And, uh... thank you. Thank you for following me. You're welcome. Where did you get that bike? There was this little girl in the middle of the road. Just gave her 10 bucks and she let me have it, I guess. Look dude, I'm sorry. I, uh... - Don't, Shannon. - I... I... no, I... I'm sorry... for everything. Well, that's good. Phew. Okay... - Okay. - Okey-dokey. - You wanna go? - Yes! - All right, okay. - Yes, yes. No one can know about what happened. No, no, absolutely not. My moms don't even know that I'm here. - And... and especially masturbation part. - Yeah. - Wait - what? - What? When did you... when did you masturbate? I didn't, I didn't. What the hell was that thing? I don't know. But I say we find out. You thinking what I'm thinking? Oh yeah. Turn this baby around, Shan. We're going to Nevada.
