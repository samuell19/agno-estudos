[groans] All right, hold on. Just don't move. Hi. Hi. [groans] Let's get that boot off now, have a look at that ankle. Are you a doctor? Yeah. Yeah? Honest. Really? Marin County Doctor's Hospital. I live there. I'm an intern. Easy.[groans] You know, I'm on the board of director's at the Doctor's Hospital. I'm Joanna Bittan. I'm Casey Wagner. You're not a doctor, are you? No. Your husband? My husband's an ex. He's not a doctor. I think it's just a sprain. There she is. Probably need a few X-rays. Oh, great, the ski patrol will get you down the mountain. You still don't recognize me, do you? Last night. The guacamole? Oh, it's you. Sorry. How could I forget? Let me help you up. Oh. [groans] Can I give you lift back to Marin? Oh, thanks. I'm with a friend. And then you're lying there on the snow and he's on top of you, and I'm panting, and tell me, tell me, then what? And then nothing. He just left me there with the ski patrol guys. Oh, I don't, pity you make life sound so boring. I'm never bored. I don't understand you. You meet this fantastic guy and what do you do? You just limp away. There was nothing to limp away from. Well, at least tell me, was he cute? Oh, he was cute. Very cute. Very young. Mm, how young? Too young. Oh, what? Six, eight, ten, what? No. The sunny side of 20. I mean, that's heaven. Oh, my gosh. Can imagine to be all things to one man? Mistress, mother.Ugh. No wonder my parents didn't want me hanging out with you in high school. They were afraid you might have a good time. You might learn something. You're terrible. Terrible. Stupid, that's the word I'm looking for, stupid. I cannot believe that you did not get her number, man. That's some high class action. Look, I'm shy, okay? Look, he's shy, okay? That German news last week-- Yeah, yeah, yeah. The whole staff knows how shy you are. That's gossip. Hey, look, look, Casey, Casey, look. Now, you don't have to be discrete with us. Tell us. She any good? She happens to be a very nice girl, and I don't want to continue talking about it, all right? He doesn't want to continue talking about it, all right? You're so sensitive. You're so selfish. Look, I'm sitting in the front this time. That's okay, I'm sleeping in the back on the way home. Sleep on. Please, please, please. Apremio. Oh, good thing, you're early. Morning. David's gonna come in at 9:00 and check the art direction for the shooting. And don't forget to call New York about the six foot three model from Kuwait who might be pregnant. Oh. Then staff at 10:00, 10:30, whenever you get done. Lunch at 12:15 with Mr. Radolf. Three o'clock the printers invade us. Oh, and I had to change your 5:30 pedicure to Wednesday. Why? Because Beasley Chartoff from the Charity Ball committee had to change the meeting at Doctor's Hospital from tomorrow to tonight, on account of her husband's going out of town tomorrow, and she wants to see that little Greek guy. Roseanna. Well, she didn't say that exactly, but we all know it's the truth. Stacy Hightower is still running a low grade fever. I'm worried about that. Yes, sir. Mrs. Palmer has gone into false labor for the third time in two weeks. Better put her on the fetal monitors. Will do, sir. Nice tan you've got, Wagner. Been lounging near the ultraviolet machines? No, sir, I had a chance to do a little skiing. Ah. I haven't been able to find the time to ski in 10 years. Tell me, did you fly to Gstaad or make due with our less illustrious local accommodations? I made due, sir. Call 6075. Dr. Michael Webber, call 6075, stat. Please call 6075. Hi. Hi. I was upstairs in a board meeting. Gosh, what a nice surprise. I was just leaving. I'm glad I bumped into you. It's nice to see you again. Nice to see you again. I see your ankle's all better. Oh, yes, thanks to you, I'm good for another ski season. I guess we must have caught the last of the snow, huh? So, I was just gonna go get a bite to eat. You hungry? Oh, I couldn't.I mean if you're not busy or anything. I couldn't really. It's okay. I understand. No, no, it's just that I'm not dressed well. You wouldn't want me to eat alone, would you? Yes, Porter, that's right. Tell him I'm terribly sorry, it couldn't be helped. That's right, and I'm canceling it for tonight. Yes, my apologies. Do tell him. Thank you. Right. Thank you, Casey. Well, the food should be pretty good here. Dr. Brinkley eats here a lot. Does he? Well, I'm sure it will be. It looks very nice. Very nice. Casey, why don't you let me invite you tonight? I'd like this to be my dinner. What? No way, Mrs. Bittan. I invited you. I'm on the board at the hospital, remember? I know what we pay interns. You wouldn't want me to live with this guilt, would you? No. I can't let you do that. I'll tell you what. I'll use it as a tax deduction. I'll charge it to the hospital. There'll be some satisfaction for you in that, won't there? Getting back at the hospital for all that terrible food you eat every day? Mrs. Bittan, I-- Look... It's my contribution to medical science, okay? And you can call me Joanna. Gosh, that was wonderful. I enjoyed it. Do you have a family? I mean children. I have one. A daughter. She live at home? She's been in New York at school for the last two years. She's coming back here to finish college at Berkeley. Gosh, Berkeley's terrific. She must really be looking forward to that, huh? I'm not so sure. New York has a lot to offer and she loves the seasons and of course her father's there. She's close to her father then? Yes, very close. I'm thrilled she's coming back. I'm scared, but thrilled. Good night again. Joanna... I'd like to see you again. That would be nice. Tomorrow? I can't, I'm... I'm giving a party. Why don't you come? Sure, it sounds great. Where? At my house at 6:00. It's casual. Here's my card. My address is on there. Joanna... Good night, Casey. Thanks again for dinner. You're welcome. Well, I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Yes. There you are. Try this. Tada!That looks good. No, not sure about this one. What's the matter? I don't like it.You don't like it? No.You know, the guys and I have been talking. You know what you need? Total change of image. Time to change the image, kid. And I've got it for you, guy, right here. Okay. This is my friend Maxwell. Come on. There we go. It's you.That looks good. Huh?Yeah. Hey, I like this.You like that, huh? $10 rental fee. Have it back in 24 hours. If not, $5 extra for overtime. It's worth it.Huh? Thank you ever so much for you patronage, my friend. And do call us again. Tell a friend. Huh? What can I do for you? Casual. She said very casual. Casual. You got to be casual with rich people. I am so tired. They booked me on back to back shifts. I got two hours sleep last night. Yeah? This is it.That looks good. Understated, casual, insouciant, and just the slightest bit wicked. Huh? Greg, you could sell locusts to a farmer, how much? Ten bucks. Ten bucks? I thought we were friends. $7.50. Never mind. It's a freebie. But do me one favor.What? One stipulation. No lipstick on the collar. Oh, that's cute. Don't touch me. Out of here. Say hello for me. See if she has any friends. Make that two. Two friends. Rich ones. Good afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Kline. How nice to see you. I can't quite place you, sir. Oh, I'm Casey Wagner. Mrs. Bittan invited me. I see. Shall I relieve you of those blossoms? These are for Mrs. Bittan. I assume so, sir. I'll be sure to see she gets them. I'd sort of like to give them to her myself. If you must. This way. Will you excuse me for moment? Sure.Sure. Excuse me. Casey.Hi. I'm so glad you could come. Oh, well, thanks. Oh, look, I brought you these. Thank you. How nice. My, my, my. What will you have to drink? Oh, gosh, maybe a Cuba Libre. A what? That's a rum and cola. I don't think we have any, but we have plenty of champagne and there's wine.That's okay. Maybe I'll just have a cup of coffee or something. All right. Porter. Porter? Would you put these in a vase, please, Porter? A crystal vase? Of course, Porter. I'm terribly sorry, but would you excuse me? Because I've got people I have to attend to. Sure, that's okay. I'll be just fine. There's plenty of food, so just make yourself at home. As soon as the crowd thins we can chat. Oh, no.Good morning. What happened? Evidently a little faux pas, sir. Oh, good. You're awake. I'm sorry, Joanna. That's all right, Porter, ask Felice to make Dr. Wagner some breakfast. It's just that I've had so many emergencies at the hospital lately I haven't had a chance to sleep. Don't worry about it. You made an ideal party guest. You didn't drink too much and no boring small talk. You're joking, but I'm very embarrassed. Don't be. Look, have breakfast, take a shower in the guest room if you like afterward, and excuse me, but I've got to run. I'll call you later. It was a lovely party. Miss Felice wants to know what you'd like for breakfast. Oh, that's all right. I'm not very hungry, thanks. Eggs Benedict, waffles, fresh fruit, juice, croissant? Maybe I'll have just a little something. I thought you might, sir. Perhaps a little of each? Yeah, that sounds good. Dr. Gill Caplan, call 110. ♪ He's so shy ♪ Too late, too late He looks the same to me. What's the matter with you guys? Oh, nothing. Except Mr. Casey "I'm-So-Shy" Wagner didn't seem to make it home last night, did he? No, he didn't. You make it home last night, Casey? Goodbye, guys. The wedding, is it casual or rich? There you go.Thank you. Oh, Phillip. You're a darling to arrange those tickets. I was absolutely fascinated. I thought you would be. Spenders of Byzantium. Like you, Joanna. Sensual, luxurious and noble. Gad, all that? I think I'm in love. At the risk of embarrassing us both, let me say how much I wish you meant that. Phillip, now, don't let spoil a perfectly beautiful friendship. I'd be willing to risk it. Good night. Good night. Dr. Brinkley, please dial-- Case! Oh, hi, Jer.Hi. Looking at the Peter's chart?Yeah. Do you agree with Dr. Brinkley's diagnosis? I'm not so sure of that. We were just talking about that. Dr. Wagner, you have a call. Oh, that's probably my mother. I hope nothing's wrong. Dr. Wagner. He's terrific. I love him. Hi. Gosh, I'm glad. I had no idea what to send you. I was just absolutely sure you didn't need more flowers. You're right. Well, to reciprocate, I thought I'd do another selfless deed for medical science. Oh, really? What's that? Well, obviously you're in need of some rest and relaxation. If you could manage tomorrow off, how about a day by the pool sort of stretched out in the sun, just laze around? If you promise to wear a bikini. Let's just hope that's not his mother. Gosh, this is terrific. How did you manage to get today off? Oh, I switched shifts with a buddy. Excuse me, Mrs. Bittan. Miss Felice needs to know what Dr. Wagner wishes to drink. Oh, gosh, I don't know. We have everything, juice, beer, wine. We also have milk, sir. Well, you may think that's funny, but that's exactly what I'd like. I nice cold glass of milk, please. JOANNE: Thank you, Porter. You know, you never told me what line of medicine you're in. Cardiology. Heart surgery. Fixing broken hearts? Yeah, sort of. So, what about you? Did all this belong to your family? My family? No. I over achieved this all by myself. I was brought up to think that if a girl was a good, dutiful daughter and a kind loving mother and wife, well, she'd just automatically be taken care of. Well, wrong. After the divorce and the shell shock wore off, I realized I was actually going to have to be responsible for myself. Horrors. I wasn't prepared to do anything. So I came up with this idea for a gift catalog business and voila. Are you comfortable? Yeah, I'm terrific, thanks. Are you very comfortable? If I was any more comfortable, I'd be asleep. Mr. Norman to see you, ma'am. I rang you on the intercom, but there was no answer. Thank you, Porter. Hello, Phillip. You left these in the car. Thank you. Oh, this is Dr. Casey Wagner. Phillip Norman. How do you do, sir? Pleasure. Well, I guess I'll be going. I'll be right back. Phillip! Stay and have a drink with us? Let's not play games, Joanna. Look... I have no claims on you, although you know damn well I wish I did. I can't compete with a young kid. Take care. I'm sorry. Let's be friends. Friends. Keep in touch. Thank you. I'm sorry if I messed things up. You didn't mess anything up. Seemed like more than a friend. Not to me. I'm glad. Casey, I'm not sure this is right. I am. Let's think about it. If you need to.I do. Oh, it's cold. Oh, darling, I want it hot. What?And I want it raw. First of all, tell me all about his body. Well, he keeps in shape. All right, so, you're in the pool with this gorgeous body. Now, don't spare any details. Tell me it all.We had a fabulous time. I mean, he's divine. Those are the details? I don't call those details. Well, you don't tell me about your sex life with Alex. Honey, there ain't nothing to tell. I'm sorry. So am I. [phone ringing] Hello? Hi. Did I wake you? No, not at all. So, how was the play? Overrated, but fun. I'll bet you thought about me the whole time, didn't you? Mm, not even once. Wait a minute, what did you say your name was? Well, I thought about you a lot. Not even once? Maybe once, twice. I'd like to come over there. Now? Please? I just need to talk to you. Casey, I don't know. Joanna, we'll just talk, I promise. I don't know. I want to see you. Please? [noise at window] I'll be right down. Hi.Hi. Gosh, you look beautiful. I thought you wanted to talk. I do. Would you just hold me, please? Just hold me. Can I help you with something? Yeah, my name's Casey Wagner, I'm here to see Joanna Bittan. Do you have an appointment? No. May I ask what this is regarding? Well, tell her it's, tell her it's regarding a walk on the beach. Hmm. You ready?Mm-hmm. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Okay.Okay. On your marks... get set... Hey, wait a minute! That's not fair.[laughs] Come on, slow poke. You're making me look good. Come on! Gosh, I love you. I hope you don't mind me saying that. No, I... I love the way your eyes smile. Well, it's because of you. Hey, listen, I got tomorrow off. You do? Oh, Casey, I have about a dozen workmen coming at 7:00 a.m. that I decided to redo Pam's room at the last minute. But why don't you spend the night and then sort of hang out by the pool tomorrow? Oh, if you're busy, I got a million things to do. Yeah, like what? Like go to the cleaners, like do the laundry, go to the grocery store. Sounds terrific. I have a better idea. Why don't we go by the hospital and I'll pick up whatever it is you need washed and Porter will run your errands tomorrow? I can't impose on you like that. Why not? It's not an imposition. Well, because, I... I don't know. I guess I'm just not used to letting people do things for me. So, what are you giving up, going to the laundry? I don't know, you meet a lot of nice people at the laundry. That's what I'm afraid of. Dr. Raider, stat. Page MICU, stat. Page Dr. Raider, MICU immediately. Hey, Casey. Oh, hi, guys. What's going on?

You're jealous. Come on, admit it. Maybe a little. That is terrific. Hey, guys, where's Wagner? He's busy. He's a busy man. Yeah. That's what I hear. Well, I haven't seen Casey around in a long time. You know romance. You know, I never thought Casey was the type. What type's that? Well, you know, I know Casey likes to have a good time.

Yeah, I'm at the emergency room. No, no, not too busy. Listen, your mother and I have a little surprise planned for you. We're gonna have it delivered around noon on your birthday. Are you gonna be there? Yeah, sure, I'll make a point to. Oh, that's good. So, tell me, what's going on? Oh, I'm doing just fine, I've been really busy, though. How's Mom? She's great.

Look, I just feel funny about you always paying for things. I love you. Then let me pay for the check, okay? But, darling, it doesn't matter who pays. I pay now, you'll pay some other time. Well, good, if it doesn't matter, then let me do it, all right? Okay. Okay, okay, if it makes you feel better. It does. Casey? Casey!Shh. Hi! Are you delivering something for Casey? What about the presents? No, let's wait a minute. Honey, that's bad, isn't it? [doorbell rings] May I be of assistance? Well, I'm Burt Wagner. Casey Wagner's father. They said at the hospital he'd be here. Dr. Wagner is not at home. He's not at home? But, you may wait inside for him if you please. Well? I can't believe this. Do you like it? Darling, what is it? It's my parents' car. Mom? Dad? Hey, Dad. Hey. Happy birthday. Hi, Dad. There was a girl in your room at the hospital. She said we'd find you here. Oh, that's Michelle, that's Gregory's sister. Well, she just needed a place to stay for a while and, well, I thought that-- Who's house is this? Mrs. Wagner, Mr. Wagner, how are you? I'm Joanna Bittan. I'm delighted to meet you, and well, isn't this lovely that we can all be together today on Casey's birthday? And what perfect timing. We have dinner reservations in an hour, and you must join us. Oh, no, I don't think so. I insist. Well, I... Good. I'm just going to run upstairs and change. I'll only be a minute. Darling, see that your parents have something to drink, will you?Sure. Well, you want something to drink? Huh?No. No. No, I don't. Well, I better get changed. I'll be back in two seconds. Well, has anyone decided yet? You told me on the phone you had to work today. Oh, I did. Well, I just traded shifts with a buddy at the last minute. Oh. Huh, well, while you decide, I'll just go into the ladies room. Excuse me. Probably was wrong of us to just burst in on you like that. You know, your mother and I hoped to surprise you for your birthday by giving you our old car. We finally decided to get a new one. Mom, it's great, really. Yeah, you don't really need a car now, do you? Look, I'm sorry you had to find out like this. I wanted to tell you, I just didn't want to do it over the telephone. Did she buy that suit for you? It was a gift. Yeah. I'm sure it was. You have really disappointed me, Casey. Really. Dad, it's not what you think. That's just what I've been praying. Ever since I saw that fancy car in the driveway, that's what I've been hoping and praying. Well, there's no fool like an old fool, is there? Let's get out of here. Dad, listen to me. Dad, would you listen to me, Dad?Oh. Mom, please talk to him. I'm sorry, Casey. I'm sorry. Casey? What can I do? Nothing. They'll get over it. Perhaps in time. You know, Joanna, I think we should tell Pamela. Let's not make the same mistake twice. You're right. W-A-G-N-E-R, right? Yes, that's right. Strange, I don't see any account in this name. Oh, I'm sorry, she was supposed to call. The charge goes to Mrs. Joanna Bittan. Oh, Mrs. Bittan. I sometimes fit the daughter. And often Mr. Curtis, her-- Her ex-husband. Oh, are you her... Boyfriend. I am Mrs. Bittan's boyfriend. Oh. Looks like a dedicated doctor's assistant. Look at him. Whew, boy.[whistling] Hello? You are one of the beautiful people. All right, guys, what's up? Hey, well, if it isn't our celebrity intern now. What? Can I have your autograph, macho face? Oh, that. What some people won't do for money. Hey, look, you're gonna be wanting to watch your boot from now on, you know.Hey, hey. Is it true you only operate in designer surgical gowns? Yeah, that's very funny. Are you serious about this thing? Are you serious about it? Hey, you're a pretty good-looking guy, you know. We were thinking maybe, you know, we could be three doctors in the operating room. GREG: Surf's up, baby. WARREN: Hey, listen, what do you think, couple of nurses, we could really do it? I tried to call Pam today. No luck. She's up in the mountains on a camping trip. Means I won't be able to talk to her till she gets here on Monday. That's too bad. Casey, what is it? You've been so quiet all evening. I'm fine. I'm just thinking. About what? I don't know, the guys at the hospital have been giving me a hard time. I guess they're jealous. I don't know, maybe I should stop driving the new car to the hospital. Maybe I ought to go back to wearing blue jeans. I have an idea. Why don't we invite them over? Are you serious? Yeah. Have a barbeque out by the pool, it would be great. Joanna, it'll never work. Why won't it work? Darling, you can't give up your life and your friends just to be with me or we can't work. I don't know. Are you embarrassed of our relationship? That's ridiculous. I just want you to be happy. Well, great. Then let's have a party. Let's have a party. You better keep your eyes on Casey tonight. Why? Well, the last time we had a pool party he sort of overdid it. He was dating Lisa at the time. Casey must have drank a whole tub of Sangria. He climbed up their flag pole. Then he took his clothes off. He's such a sucker for a tear. [laughs] Oh, but, well, that was ages ago, really. Last summer, for sure. Warren! Come on, get out of there! I'm gonna go grab some towels, all right? Joanna? Joanna, wait! Where are you going?I'll be back. So you had a rude awakening. I mean, I've had plenty of 'em in all my relationships. But don't you see, I mean, the highlight of their evening was throwing themselves in the pool with their clothes on. If I understand you correctly, what you're saying is that you realized last night that Casey is young? Yes.And that's news? Well, I haven't seen that side of him. I mean, around me he's so mature. Darling, just relax, take it easy. For all you know, next time you'll throw yourself in the pool. And with no clothes on. Bad.Good. I told you bad's good. Do you like these?I love them. [phone ringing] Wagner's? Hi, Benny, it's Casey. Is my dad there? Oh, yeah. Just a minute. I'll see. It's Casey again. I'm sorry, Casey. He just stepped out. Yeah, sure, Benny. Well, ask him to call me, would you? Yeah. Sure. Yeah, I'll make sure he calls you. Bye. That doesn't look too good. Look, here's the hairline fracture right there. Lower humerus and the left elbow, and there's another angle. Sure, notice how it just branches from there right down to there? Dr. Wagner? Dr. Casey Wagner? I'm gonna show these to Dr. Brinkley. Hello? Hi, how are you? Great, how about you? Well, how's Dad? He's fine. He's fine. Listen, I'm calling 'cause Aunt Minnie's gonna have a picnic on Sunday. I thought maybe you'd try to make it down. Sure, yeah, I'd love to. Just let me check with Joanna, okay? Casey? I think it'd better if you came alone. I think you need the time with your father. Well, you really think that's gonna do any good? Honey, it's just that he's so, he's so hurt. Well, what about me, Mom? How does he think I feel? Look, why don't you just put him on the phone? I want to ask him myself. Well, he's not home. He won't talk to me, will he? That's why I feel you should come down and see each other face to face. Okay, Mom. I'll see what I can do, all right? I'll let you know. Okay. Okay, thanks. Bye. Yeah. All right. Bye bye. [knocking] Casey, what are you doing here? I'm on my way to the airport. Why? I talked to my mom. My dad still won't speak to me. I just want to go down there and try and straighten things out. Darling, you're on duty tomorrow night. I know. I'll be back in time. Joanna. God, I'm embarrassed to ask you this. I need to borrow 100 bucks for plane fare. Of course. I'm sorry. I'm broke. Casey, don't worry about it, okay? I just hate to ask you. Casey, don't be silly. I'll pay you back at the end of the month, I promise. Please don't worry about it. Let's not talk about it. Take it. Thanks. Casey, don't be so stubborn, go on up and take a nap. Mom, it's quarter of 6:00. Shouldn't he be here by now? Yeah, Benny's bringing him home. Maybe they stopped for a beer. Ah, no, here he is. Hi, Dad. I don't think you should have come here. Well, I think we should talk. I don't think there's anything to say. I'm just glad my father's not alive, that's all. What the hell is that supposed to mean? That's not what he means. It's just he's upset about your friend. My friend what? Well, she's almost as old as I am. So what difference does that make? What does age have to do with anything? Well, it's not the age, it's... It's what? Well, you know what it looks like. No, I don't know, Mom, so, why don't you tell me? What it looks like is that you've lost your self respect. It looks like you're a gigolo. I can't believe you think that. Well, she's paying for you, isn't she? And in return you tend to her needs. Isn't that why you're living at her house? I love Joanna, and that is why I live at her house. Don't you know me at all? Hello? I'm your son. The one who quit the football team in high school because he wanted to go to work to pay his way to college. The one who kept winning scholarships. The one who worked his way through medical school. Look, I spent the first 23 years of my life working so hard just to make you proud of me. But I got to spend the next 23 years living it to your specifications? Dad, you won't return my phone calls because you think I'm a gigolo? Casey, you can't change the truth. She's paid for you. You're kept. Casey! Hi, darling. When I heard the car pull up, I thought it was Pam. How did it go with your father? Not great. I'm sorry, baby. I'm so sorry. Do you want to tell me about it? Let's save it for later, okay? Okay. You look exhausted. Why don't you go upstairs and sleep? I don't think it's such a good idea for Pamela to come home and find some guy in her mother's bed. I'm just gonna grab my swimming suit and maybe try and catch a nap by the pool. You two should be alone for awhile. Thank you. Thank you. PAMELA: Felice! Pamela.Hi. Let me help you, darling.Thank you. Hello, Porter. Baby, welcome home. Hi, Joanna. Hi, Darling. Gosh, it's good to see you. You look so pretty. Come on in, let me show you what I've done to your room. Okay. Well? Well? The house looks great. Well, naturally. Pammy? I wanted to talk to you about something. I tried to call you in New York, but you'd already gone up to the mountains. Nothing too drastic, I hope. Yes and no. Joanna, there's a young man out by the pool. That's what I wanted to talk to you about, Pammy. Mother, why do you always do this to me? Every time I come home you're trying to fix me up with a friend's kid. The day I come home? Do we get engaged before or after I unpack? He's not here for you, Pam. Oh, well, then, who is he, Mother? What's he doing here? He lives here. Pamela? Hi. Is Casey all right, or should I call you step-father? Casey will do just fine. I sort of spied you out the window, and then Joanna lowered the boom. Needless to say, I was taken aback. Pamela, your mother's been very worried about telling you. She tried to call you last week. Yes, I know. So... I trust you're all settled in? Noticed a great sports car out front. It's yours, I take it? Yes. Present from Joanna? Yeah, for my birthday. Pamela. Look, I know exactly how you feel. How could you possibly? Good morning, darling. Good morning, Felice.Good morning. Good morning. Where's our medical staff this morning? Casey left at dawn. He has a morning shift. Pamela? Do you think we ought to talk about it? What's there to say? You're happy. Pammy. Do you know what you're doing? I mean, really. No. I don't suppose I do. We didn't mean it to happen. It just happened. We fell in love. Well, just what is love to you? It's what I feel. Give him a chance. He's really very nice. Well, if you like him, Mother, shouldn't that be enough? I got to go meet Cassie. [door knocking] Come in. Wagner? Yes, sir. You gave me the wrong data for Mrs. Churnek. I nearly removed her tonsils. Sir? Here, you gave me the file of Miss Arlene Churville, age five. I can't believe this, sir, I'm sorry. Sit down. What's up with you lately, doctor? I suppose I'm having problems in my personal life, sir. Hmm. An intern cannot afford a personal life if it interferes with his duty. Our work here cannot adjust to a frivolous mistake. Do I make myself clear? As always, sir. Let me give you a word of advice. If you can't fix it, get rid of it. Yes, sir. Wonderful. Hi, Carol. You forgot the programs. Oh, sit, I'll take care of it. How many? Three. Let me give you some money. No, I got it. Be right back. Well? $5 a piece? Casey! Hey, Case.Hi. Don't you look sharp. He looks like a waiter. I didn't know you liked the ballet. Oh, I'm not sure if I do, I've never been. Where are you sitting? Third row. Third row? I can't believe it. I waited in line for five hours before the box office opened on the first day of sales and we're up in the boondocks. Great. We're getting together afterwards at the Moon Club for some serious dancing, you want to come? Hey, it sounds great, but I-- I know, don't tell me, formal dinner, right? Enjoy the ballet. See you later. This form is called a "pas de deux." I know that. Why do you always assume I'm ignorant of these things? I'm sorry, Casey. Forgive me? Chenko. Did you see that body? Fantastic the way he filled out a pair of tights. I mean, the grace, the elegance, those leaps. Staggering. Frank even managed to stay awake. Marginally. I don't believe that. There's Henny Brandywine. [gasps] Sunshine. Oh, my. Looks like a resurrection. You got a wicked glow. Look who's behind. The Shadow. The Shadow. Look who's there. Well, I declare you look like a movie star. Oh, so do you, darling. Hello, dear. Oh, Sybil. It's been too long. It has. I'd like you to meet my friend Casey Wagner. Your friend? How nice. How do you do? Casey, I'd like to have you meet my friend, Grainger Morrison.Pleasure. Nice to meet you. Thank you, darling. My Grainger's a quick draw. You know they say smoking's bad for your sex life, darling. Oh, I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble, dear. Oh, touche, Henny, touche. [applause] I'll meet you in the lobby, okay? Boring, isn't it? Gotta stay sober, too, or I can't do my duty by old Henny. Oh, you'd be surprised at the hot blood pumping through that old broad. How about yours? My what? Your patroness, Joanna. She looks like one very hot lady. [grunts] Come on, we have to get out of here. Excuse me, folks, Joanna's had a slight problem at home. It's nothing serious, we just can't make the party. Excuse us.Joanna, is it something about Pamela? I hit Grainger Morrison.What? Why? Because he said something I didn't like, all right? I don't believe it. What did he say? What difference does it make? For God's sake, Casey. Couldn't you behave like a gentleman? Joanna, I am not a gentleman right now. I'm an angry kid. Now, let's go. Where are we going? Dancing.Dancing? Don't they know this is doctor's night at the Moon Club? Really. Why doesn't anybody come over to me yet? Here you go.Thank you. Thank you. You can put it on my tab. Casey Wagner. He's just joking.Warren Frankstein. Dr. Frankstein. Paging Dr. Warren Frankstein. You came! Hey.Hey. Hey, what happened to your party? Oh, nothing, we just thought it'd be more fun here with you. Well, let's get to it, boys. Like to dance?What? Would you like to dance? Oh, no, thank you. I'm just gonna watch for awhile. You want a drink? No, thanks. Hi, how are you doing? Hi. You like to dance? Yeah, sometimes. Yeah? Mrs. Bittan. Hi, sweetheart. What are you doing here? I, how are you, Wanda? I suppose you could say I'm partying. Did you come with Pam and Kathy? No. Why? Oh, well, I'm sure they're around here somewhere. I guess I'll just go find them. Well, should we go home? Sure. Joanna? I'm tired, Casey. I don't want to talk. We'll talk tomorrow. I work a double shift tomorrow. The day after tomorrow then. Joanna? Yes? Forget it. Hi. I was working my way over to you at the Moon Club. I saw you run out of there like two bats out of hell. What happened? You two have a fight? You really think I'd give you the satisfaction of telling you if we did? Oh, ho, venom. Look, why are you giving me such a hard time? I live here, you live here, what's the point? The point is, doctor, that I care about my mother. Oh, and I don't? Well, maybe you do today. What about 10 years from now? In 10 years you're gonna be at the prime of your life and my mother is gonna be well past hers. She'll have lines, sags. You can only keep up this youth business for so long, you know. She's not gonna wanna run to the Moon Club with you and your friends at your whim. I don't see what worrying about 10 years from now has to do with anything. Do you want a family 10, 20 years down the line? Joanna can't give you that. She's already had her family. You're gonna live your life in hostility and resentment. And you're gonna grow to hate Joanna for something that she has no control of. For aging. Pleasant dreams. [intercom buzzes] Yes, Roseanna? Your ex-husband's on the line. Thank you. Hello, Curtis. Pamela didn't tell me you were coming to town. She doesn't know. I wanted to see you first. Can we meet for a drink? Sure, I'd love to. Where and when? Ready for my other drink. I have never seen a Pina Colada sit in front of you intact for more than 45 seconds. Now, what's wrong? It's Pam. It's just not working out. I know she came out here meaning well. Until she met Casey. Oh. Between him and Pam and Casey, Casey's friends and me and Casey and my friends, I feel like shredded wheat. Maybe you could ask him to move out temporarily. Just for a few weeks until things settle down. I can't do that. Why? I'm afraid if I did, it would end. Well, if it would maybe it should then. No, no, I'm fine. I'll find something. Just have a nice dinner with Curtis and Pam, and I'll see you at home later. Okay, bye. PAM: This is just where I felt like having dinner. CURTIS: Good. PAM: I'm glad you didn't tell us where we were going. I love surprises. Well, I know you and your mother are addicted to soft-shelled crabs. Must be something in your genes. Darling, I'm gonna call and see if Casey's back yet. I'll be right back. Is Casey so horrible? No. He's a nice guy. So? So? I don't think that it's a love match. I think they're just infatuated. Is that really your affair? It seems you're trying to upset their relationship. Come on, Daddy, how could I if they were really in love? I will admit that I've slung a few verbal arrows, but big deal. I think Mother's problem is that she's never met anyone who compares to you. You're different, Daddy. You're worldly and sophisticated and-- Stop it, Pamela. You're nursing a fantasy. I love your mother, but I'm not in love with her anymore. You're just saying that. No, I'm not. And you have to let go. Your mother's suffering. Why don't you concentrate your energies where they belong? Into your relationship with her. Now that's obviously in need of attention. Pamela? What can I say? You're right. I love her. Don't tell me, tell her. You girls can wait here, I'll get the car. Mom? Yes, dear? Oh, thank you. I forgot. Thank you, Pam. Mom? Yes, love? I love you. Pammy. Pam. If you knew how long I waited to hear you say that... And if Casey makes you happy, then I'll try to be nice. I just missed you so much. I missed you, too, baby. [door opens] [door closes] Hi, stranger. Hi. How come you're still up? I wasn't sleepy. You have fun?Yeah. Shot pool, played pinball. Got a little drunk. Are you tired? Not especially. Why? Can we talk, Casey? Sure. What is it? What's wrong? It can't work with us. It can't work with us. What are you talking about? It can work. How? In a vacuum? By pretending people around us don't exist? It's a fantasy. What do you mean, a fantasy? This is real to me. I don't understand you. I don't even know what's happening right now. I love you, Joanna. I love you, too. It's just not enough. It's enough for me. For now. What about years from now? I'll be 64, Casey, when you're my age. Will you love me then? Will you? Of course. No you won't. You'll feel restless. And I'll feel... I'll feel old. So, love counts for nothing? No. No. I'll always love you. You know I'm right, don't you? Casey? Take care of yourself.
