[Intriguing climactic music] [ominous music] [door knocking] - Bring her in. Is this the girl? - Amanda Peterson. - Why is her face covered? - No! Her eyes are sensitive to light. - Even at night? Has her father been found? - No, not yet. We expanded our search without any leads. It's impossible to know where he is. - Can you save her? - We will do what we can. The Lord is powerful within these walls. Sister? Take Amanda to the third floor. Keep her away from the other children and make sure her door remains locked. - Yes, Father. - Have faith in the Lord, my child. [Ominous music] [Sister gasping] [Amanda gasping] - Oh, I'm so sorry. - Do you wanna play a game? - It's much too late for that. It's time for bed. - Daddy didn't wanna play either. - What happened to your father? - [Amanda] We wanna play hide and seek. - We? - Yes, me and my friend. - Who is your friend? [Door creaking and slamming] [Sister breathing softly] [door creaking] Amanda? Amanda? [Clock chiming] Amanda? [Light buzzing] [ominous music] - He doesn't like the light. - Amanda. Amanda? [Light buzzing] Amanda? Amanda? Amanda? [Light buzzing] [ominous music] [door creaking and slamming creepily] Amanda? [Door creaking and booming] - Now we're recording. - Good. This is Father Wes from St Petersburg Orphanage. The date is June 6th, 1966 at the time of 7 p.m. I've asked Father Thomas to assist me with Amanda Peterson, who has properly secured and is being lit by candlelight. Do you know why you're here, Amanda? I need you to answer yes or no, Amanda. - Yes. - Why are you here, Amanda? - [Amanda] You're trying to take my friend away. - [Father Thomas] And who is your friend? - [Amanda] Daddy didn't play by the rules. - [Father Thomas] What rules, Amanda? - [Amanda] You have to play in the dark. He doesn't like the light. It hurts him just like me. We're the same. [Hard rock music] [muffled crosstalk] - Beer? - I've got one. - Oh, okay. - Look who it is. - Hey, sis. - Hi! - What's goin' on? - You brought Becca. - Yeah. Finally convinced her come along with us, tonight. - Of course, the more the merrier. - What's up, Todd? - How're you doin'? - Good to see you. - Welcome. - Hey. - Hey. - Good to see you. - Where are Adam and Shane? - They said they'd be runnin' late. - Surprise, surprise. Well let's get started. I have a new location that will make up for the last one. [Both inquisitive humming] - Ooh no way, we made an orphanage? - Yeah, this place looks huge. - It is. It's got three stories, it has a worship area, a cellar, a courtyard. - Security? - Yes, every two hours. This place is so big and our time is so limited, we're gonna have to split up to cover the most area. - Why was it abandoned? - I'm not really sure why. I came up mostly empty-handed in my research. The building's been abandoned for nearly 50 years. Sometime in the late 60s, there was a commotion about the orphanage. It was rumored that employees and children were going missing. Eventually the church stepped in and shut it down and no one has been in it since. [Gasping] - Where's our big shout out? - You're late. - Hello. Muah, thank you. - We brought stuff. - Well that's good. - What'd we miss? - Well, Kate was telling us about the abandoned orphanage. - Ooh, oldie but a goodie. - You know it? - Of course. - Thank you. - My mom used to try to use that shit on me and scare me when I was a little kid. - We could see what a wonderful job it did. - Why are we talkin' about it? - Katie's officially made it our next urban explorer site. - All right. To the urban explorers. - What society has left behind. - Discarded. - Forgotten. - [All] Allowed for nature to take back and left for us to explore! [Everyone shouting] - All right, eat up, we got to get our eight hours tonight. - Guys before we break off and eat and all that, I wanna say something 'cause you're all here and you're all like my family, so I can't think of a better time to do this. I know it's only been six months, but I feel like I've known you forever. I loved you since the first moment I saw you and I can't imagine another day in my life without you as my partner. Becca, will you go on the adventure with me? - Yes. [Everyone cheering] - Oh yeah! - Put it in her! - Okay we need a picture, we need a picture. - Okay we need a picture of these now. - Why? - Really? Do you guys seriously need to remember this moment for the rest of your lives? - Yes, we do. Picture time. - Immortalize it in a photo. All right, all right. - Okay. Okay, everyone. Ready? - Ready. - Say cheese. - [All] Cheese! - Hey Kate, we're all set up. Let's go. What's wrong? - Nothing. - Okay, I'm not stupid. I know that look you get when something's bothering you. What is it? - Ooh, I get it. - Get what? - I saw how you reacted when Todd proposed to Becca. Do you not like Becca? - No, of course I do. It's just that was the very first time I've ever heard my brother mention marriage and we tell each other everything. So to hear it the first time with all of you felt shocking, like he didn't want his sister to be a part of that decision. Like what else is he not telling me? - Okay, you're way overthinking it. He's your brother. He's not just gonna cut you out of his life. It'll be good. Now put on a smile and let's go check out this amazing location you found for us tonight. - Let's do it. - Let's go. [Crickets chirping] [foreboding music] [chains rattling] [eerie music] Guys, let's take a picture before we head in. [Muffled crosstalk] Ready? Okay, I'm coming. Say cheese. [Crow cawing] - Thanks. Okay you guys, side entrance is right over there. Let's go. [Muffled whispering] [suspenseful music] [everyone screaming] - Oh Gods, it's not that serious. - Speak for yourself. - Hey Ryan, help me out with this. - Becca. - Hey, Becca. - Hey, Becca. - First exploration? - Hey, who's got the walkie talkies? - Oh no, I knew I forgot something. - You didn't. - I am sorry, guys. Honest mistake. - It's a safety precaution. - Well, safety's for losers. Well, I mean... [both chuckling] Calm your tits, we brought them. - What's the matter? Scared you're gonna get lost? - No, this place is huge. We can't be wanderin' around without them. - Maybe that's God's way of thinning out the herd. - Survival of the fittest. - I'm sure you two would be the first to go. - Okay okay, I see how it is. [Grunts] - Check these, check these. - It's got to be more of a deep bend. Deep and-- - Bend. That's functional. Completely functional strength. - There we go. - There it is, got it. - You guys are pretty gay. - Haven't you ever heard of a bromance? - Yeah, who's the bigger spoon? - Me. - Dude. - Right? - Not this week. - Oh that L. - Yeah. - All right all right, lovebirds you're very cute but ready to get goin'? I got hour 50. Get ready to synchronize in three, two, one. [Watches beeping] All right. - All right, that door there goes upstairs. - Becca and I'll take that. - Okay. That goes to the kitchen. - We'll take that 'cause I'm starving. - Eww, there can't be anything good in there. - Be better than your cookin'. - Ooh, snap! - Ooh! - Yup, you're not havin' dinner tonight. - Well I guess that leaves us with this way. Love you. Love you, miss you. - Keep an eye on them? - Hurray for us. - You wanna check out the offices? - Sure. [Ominous music] - Booyah, first place. - Ooh, second place. Sober and still good. â™ª Yeah - This in third, this in fourth; you lose. - Ooh losers. - Oh damn, hey look Tiff. It's like your wet dream. You got all those lock stuff. Keys. - Did you see that? Something just ran across. - What? [Ominous music] [ominous booming] [bell dinging] - [fake accent] Excuse sir, are you checking in today? - [Fake accent] I can't feel my legs. - [Fake accent] I would like three cheeseburgers, four-- - Guys. Seriously guys? This was an orphanage, not a mental institution. - What's the difference? - Nothing, really, when it comes to you two. - Ooh. - Ooh, snap! - Yo Ryan, you should keep a tighter leash on your girl. - Not his girl, we're just friends. - Yuh huh, like me and Adam were just friends. - [Chuckles] Wait a minute, what? - Okay guys, let's keep going. Come on. - Okay, where do you wanna go? To pound town? - No, not to pound town. - So just friends, huh? - Can we not talk about that now? I have a lot on my mind, I don't need your voice in my head. - Yeah, no worries. - Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. - No just like you said, we can talk about it later. Hey check this out. - Can you imagine wearing an outfit like that? - Not really. - Wow. What? - You know what this reminds me of? - What? - That show where they hunt ghosts. - Oh yes, I have just the thing. - Oh yeah, perfect. - Mmkay. - How do I look? - Looking good. Tell our viewers at home what we found, baby? - Don't call me baby. Let's keep it professional, Karen. - Yes, Mr Baby. - Mmm, that's more like it. Crikey, why are we here? Never seen one of these in the wild before. - I thought you said you wanted to be like a guy who hunts ghosts, not be Australian guy. - You don't like my accent? - [Karen] Uh uh, I'm sorry. But here, lemme give it a try. - All right, give it to me. Aww, look how cute she is. - Thank you. - Hi. All right, where are we? - As you can clearly see, we're now in the kitchen of the famed abandoned orphanage. - Yeah in the kitchen, my favorite spot. What's it called? - It's called... I actually don't know the name of this place. What is it? - I don't know what it's called, I thought you would know the name. [Ominous banging] What was that? - I don't know. But let's go check it out, shall we? - Yes. - Very romantic, Todd. - Ooh yeah, well I try. Wanna check this one out? Oh God, no no no no no! Mmm, jeez. Hey, look at that. [Floor creaking] Come on. - Babe, what am I supposed to be looking for? - It's not so much about finding something. It's about exploring what once was. Look at this place, it used to be filled with little kids runnin' around. Now it's just totally forgotten. - I can't tell if they left in a hurry or looters came in. - Could be both. - In establishment this big couldn't just pick up and leave in the middle of the night. Could they? - I don't know. You'd be surprised at how fast people could move with the right motivation. - Should we move on? - Yeah, sure. Hey hey, Becca. Wanna check this one? - Door is locked. - Grab my crowbar. It's back here. The big pouch. All right. Looks like they don't want anyone gettin' in. - Or getting out. [Lock clanking] [ominous growling] - I'm just saying that-- - Yo. - If you haven't tried this-- - Oh, look outside. - Look at that. - Oh, there's no window. - Cool. - Damn, is this a lime tree? - Citrus fruits. - Wow. - It's a lime. - I bet this place was beautiful back in the day. - Yeah. - Move, I need a pee. - Yeah, me too. Do you wanna cross swords? - Okay. - Wait, hang on. There you go. - There's no moon. Right? [Adam grunting] [fluid squishing] - Oh, right I-- - Eww, gross. - Guys, show some respect. - What? I thought you ladies might wanna take a peek. - Well did you bring the magnifying glass? [All laughing] - Ooh, I thought I was done. - Do you hear that? - Could have been a raccoon. - Did you guys hear that? Guys? [Ominous music] - What'd you find? - This cabinet, it says private on it. - [Grunts] Yeah. - Ooh. - Oh, man. Here. Tapes, journals, docs. Here, what's in here? - Oh my God, these are the people who went missing from the orphanage. - Look at this. - That kid was messed up. No wonder they locked that in the drawer. - Yikes, they used to perform exorcisms here. - Let's check this out. "Property of Father Thomas." [Chuckles] - Let's see. - "August 10th, 1966. "Do not fear what you are about to suffer. "Behold, the Devil is about to cast some of you into prison "so that you will be tested "and you will have tribulation for 10 days. "Be faithful until death "and I will give you the crown of life. "Revelations 2:10. "Even with these words to hold close, "I am truly being tested. "We've locked Amanda up in her chambers, "but she still manages to escape "and run around the halls at night. "Every night we lose someone. "The church refuses to send help. "Where is the light in all this darkness?" - He's tryin' to-- [ominous crashing] Let's go check it out. [Feet stomping quickly] Adam? - Shane? [Ominous bell dinging] - It's like a freezer or something. [Ominous music] - What was that? - That scared the hell outta me. Holy shit! - What, what is it? - There was somebody behind you. - No there isn't. - I swear to God there was somebody standing right behind you. - Are you trying to scare me? - I'm not lying, there was something there. - Lemme see. [Radio beeping] [Karen gasping] - Guys. - Jeez. What's up? - We need you guys to come to the third floor. - We'll be right there. Save the battery. - I don't think we should be in here. [Ominous music] [sinister growling] - Soon as I closed the door, it was like right in front of you right there I thought. - You're tryin' to scare me. - I swear... - Wait. - Oh God, what? - What was that? - What was what? - You didn't hear it? - No, it probably just the winds. Stop scaring me. [Ominous girl laughing] [door creaking] [ominous music] - Wow. - Yeah this is cool, right? - Did you guys find anything? - Yeah, we found some pretty cool stuff. We left it back at central. - Except for this. - Wow. [Camera clicking] [haunting music] - [Amanda] You wanna play? - Oh my God. How did you get in here? You shouldn't be in a place like this. Your parents must be worried sick about you. Hey, where'd you go? - Do you wanna play a game? If you wanna play, you have to turn off the light. - I don't wanna play your game. [Door creaking and slamming] Help. Help guys, help me please! Please! - Babe, I'm gonna check out this room. - Hey Tiff, I bet you could have picked those locks. - Wait, where's Tiff? Tiff? - Hey Tiff, come in. - Hello, hello? Guys, can you hear me? Hello. - Hey, what's goin' on? - Tiff's missing. - Have you tried her cell phone? - I'm not gettin' any signal. - I'm not either. - Me too. - Hey Tiff, can you hear us? - Please come in! Hello, I'm here please! Hello! Can you hear? Ugh! Okay. [Breathes heavily] [eerie mumbling] [eerie growling] - Hey Tiff, can you hear us? - I'll go check on the second floor. She was just right behind me. - Okay hey you guys, go with her. Find Tiff and just come right back, okay? - Yes mother. - Come on guys. - Thank you, mother. Would you like us to do the dishes too? - Tiff? Hey, what's goin' on with Tiff? - Nothin', she just wandered off. They're lookin' for her. - You guys, listen to this. March second 1966. Today we finally received Amanda Peterson. - Tiff? Tiff? - The police reported to me that her father went missing. They thought it best for the girl to stay here. We shall make a home for this poor girl and lead her to salvation. - Tiff? Tiffany? - May the Lord direct our hearts towards the love of God and let us help this poor child discover the light within her heart. - Tiffany? - And become strong in the eyes of the Lord. [Eerie moaning] - What's that? What, what is it? What is it? - It's Tiff's flashlight and walkie. - You think she just ran off? - She wouldn't leave this behind. Tiff? Tiff? Guys? [Ominous music] Guys? Guys, where are you? Guys. [Shane shouting] [Adam laughing] Screw you! [Adam and Shane groaning] - Damn it, Jackie. You broke my light. - That's what you get, assholes. - Aw Jackie. - Was it something I said? - September first, 1966. The power of faith has once again shown me the way: light. We installed the lights and secured her room to prevent her from hurting anyone else. There shall never be darkness around her. [Ominous music] - What else does it say? - The light shines in the darkness and the darkness did not comprehend it. I'm afraid even the darkness can reach deep within. I can find no way to stop the darkness that lurks within these halls. No one is safe. I have told everyone to leave. I locked myself in to watch over Amanda. With God as my witness, I shall make sure she doesn't escape. That's his last entry. - Guys. - Hey, I'll be right there. Katie. Hey Katie, what's up? - I just can't imagine being trapped in a room like this. - [Sighs] Yeah. - Did you find her? - What's going on? - Tiff is missing. - But she left some of her stuff in one of the rooms. - That makes no sense. Where could she have gone? - We don't know for sure that she was trapped here. - That's what the journal said. - Yeah but you can't believe everything you read, Katie. I bet she got outta here and went on to live a full, happy life. [Eerie whispering] [ominous music] - Todd! - Holy shit! Come on, let's go. Hey Guys! Kate? - Hey, come on. Let us out! - Ryan, get it open. - Whadya think I'm doin'? - Hurry! - Seriously guys, open the door. - Hey come on. You guys, hang on; let us out. - Hurry! - You guys, hey. Open the door, guys. Come on! - Come on, put your back into it. - He's not helping. - I'm sure they're just joking with us. - Does it look like we're laughing? Come on, let's go. - You okay? - What's goin' on? - What the hell was that? - What happened? You okay? - There was a little girl in there. - She just showed up and then the door slammed on us and she was gone. - A little girl? - She just vanished out of thin air. [Clapping and laughing] - Well done, guys. I mean I never took you two to be pranksters, but you really had these guys goin'. - No, we're not makin' this up, Adam. There was something trapped in there with us. [Ominous banging] [eerie music] - What was that? - Maybe it was a little girl that disappeared into the-- - Dude, shut up. - If that's a little girl, why don't you two go check it out. - Well-- - Go check it out. - I would but-- - Yeah, okay. - You know. [Adam clucking] I twisted my-- - Adam come back. [Adam clucking] - I'm sure it's nothing. Just scare him a little bit. - Hello, anyone there? Tiff? See guys, there's nothin' to worry about. There's nothing here. [Demonic growling] [Adam screaming] No, no, oh my God! [Demonic growling] [Adam screaming] Oh God, fuck! [Adam screaming loudly] [demonic hissing and growling] Help me, man! [Shane screaming] [Adam screaming] [ominous girl laughing] [sinister music] - Shane stop! Shane! Shane no! [Ryan screaming] Oh fuck! God, oh God! - Hey hey hey hey hey. Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe. Breathe, breathe, breathe. - I got it, I got it. [Ryan screaming] - There's something out there. She had him do it. - Adam. [Eerie mumbling] Adam! [Muffled crosstalk] Adam! Oh God! Adam! Adam, come on man! Where are you? - [Ghostly Woman] Shane. - Adam. - [Ghostly Woman] Shane. - Adam, where are you, dude? - I'm over here. - What? - Over here. - Where, where? - [Demonic Adam] I'm over here. [Ominous music] - You're okay. You're okay. - What are you doing? - It can be Adam or Shane. - You sure you wanna take that risk? - Shane, Adam? [Sinister banging] Come on guys. Guys, we gotta go. Go, go, go! - Outta here. - Go, go, go, go go. - Here, help me with this. Come on. [Grunts] Okay. [Sinister music] Go, go, go. - We gotta get outta here. Run! - Wait! We can't leave. - Why not? - Tiff is still missing. - Are you kidding? What do you think just happened to Adam and Shane? - We can't just give up. - I don't think she's missing, Jackie. - Our lives are in danger if we don't leave right now. - I'm staying. - Hey, don't be stupid about this. - You would if it was Kate. - Just get Ryan to the hospital. I'll stay here with Jackie; we'll look for Tiff. - What are you, crazy? That's suicide. - We trapped that thing in the cellar, right? We should be safe. [Demonic growling] [Jackie screaming] - Jackie! [Demonic growling] [Jackie screaming] - Shit, run, run! Come on, get outta my way! - You guys, we're trapped. - Don't say that, we'll find another way out. Right, Kate? - Yes, yes, by the entry way. It's not far. - The door? - Yeah. - Move! Come on, let's go. - Yeah. - Hey, [breathes heavily] come on. Come on. Goddammit. Yeah. - Come on. - Push it. - We're all gonna die here. - Don't say that, we're gonna find another way out. - [Grunts] There is no other way out. Katie, he said there's only two entrances right? All right this is it, come on. Come on. - We're all gonna end up like Adam and Shane and Jackie and Tiff. - Stop talking like that, Karen! We're gonna get outta here, all right? We're all gonna end up them. [Karen weeping] - Come on. - You guys, she needs air! - We can't get out, Becca. - Didn't we pass the courtyard or something on the way in here? - Yeah. If one of us can get over, maybe we can open the door from the outside. - I'll lift you up? - Yeah, can you get me up there? - What if that doesn't work? - Then it doesn't work, at least we tried something. Come on. - We have to think through this, Todd. - [Todd] You got a better idea? Come on. Everybody, come on. Let's go. - Can you run? - I can run. - Okay, go. [Breathes heavily] Just breathe. We're gonna be fine. - Fuck it, fuck it. - Here. - Do you need to sit down? - Where? Hey, Eric! [Muffled crosstalk] [steel bar clanging] - Shit, okay. - Okay, now breathe. - Boo! [Todd gasping] - Todd? - Oh my God! - What? - Are you okay? - I saw a little girl. - What happened? - Babe. - Shit. - I'm fine, I'm fine. - Shit. - Ryan. Guys, guys, look at Ryan. - Holy shit. - I got it, I got it. - We should call an ambulance! - Come here. Ryan? Ryan, give it up. - He's lost a lot of blood. - No shit, Sherlock. - Hey don't talk to her like that. - Okay, I can bandage him up properly if I have my kit. - Well where's that? - It's back at base camp. - Okay. - Deep breaths. - Shit, okay let's go get it. - No, dude come on. You're not thinking about goin' back in there, are you? - What other choice do we have, man? That thing can clearly go wherever the hell it wants. We gotta get outta here. I'll move Ryan, come on. - Fuck! - You all right, buddy? Come on, we're gonna get you outta here. Come on, come on, come on. - Wake up, wake up, wake up. - All right, come on buddy. - Let's do this. - Oh fuck, all right. [Pants] You all right, man? You're gonna be okay. - Karen, can you bandage him up? - [Grunts] Fuck. [Door banging] - Shit. - What? - I got nothing, you got anything? - Nothing. - All right, Karen will you watch him for me? - Hey, where are you going? - To see if I get service. - No, not by yourself. - Why not? - I'm going with you. Hey, I'm gonna go with her all right? I'm gonna be okay. You stay here. - Okay, we gotta get moving. - I'll be right back. I love you. - Okay, be safe. - Stay safe. I'll be right back. Hey Katie, Katie! Katie, Katie hold on. Katie! Kate. - What? - What's going on with you? - Well let's see, four of our closest friends are dead and Ryan's in desperate need of medical attention, so how do you expect me to react? - You know what I mean, you've been acting different. You're not the type to lash out at people, especially Becca. - Oh my God, this is not the time to be having that discussion. - When will be the time? 'Cause we might not make it outta here. If that's the case, I don't wanna leave things like this between you and me. So what's up? - Fine. I am thrilled for your engagement. - Our engagement, that's really what this is about? - I'm sure the two of you will be very happy together. - But you're not, so what's the problem? You don't like Becca? - I love Becca. - Okay, so what is it? Come on. - Why didn't you tell me you were thinking of marrying her? - [Sighs] I don't always tell you everything. - Oh that's bullshit, Todd! You've known her for six months. You've known me for your entire life. Why did you keep that from me? Why did I have to find out with everybody else? What else are you keeping from me? [Somber piano music] What else are you keeping from me? - After graduation, we were thinking about moving. - Moving where? - We don't know, just somewhere better to raise a family. - When are you gonna tell Mom? She already knows. Great, the last to know again. Thank you for that. - I'm sorry, Katie. You don't have to stay here either. - I am not gonna be the one who leaves mom alone again. But don't worry, we'll be fine. We won't need you. - Don't be like this. Hey. - [Karen] Kate, he's awake. - Katie. Hey, come on. - I got it, I got it. - You all right? - Hey. - You okay? - Yeah. [Fire crackling] [foreboding music] - Find anything in there? - "But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, "we have fellowship with one another "and the blood of Jesus Christ, his son, "cleans us from all sin. "The Lord has heard our prayers. "We kept the demon and Amanda at bay "and had our first restful night. "Tomorrow we shall perform Amanda's exorcism "and remove the demon that follows her." Maybe something on here can help us. - What's that? - We found this in the files. Exorcism 666. - Do we really wanna hear that? - We should know what we're up against. - [Father Wes] Is that what happened to Sister Mary Roberts and the other orphans? - [Amanda] They had to be punished. - [Father Wes] Where are they, Amanda? - [Amanda] He took them into the dark. - [Father Wes] Is he here with us now, Amanda? - [Amanda] Yes. He doesn't want you to hurt me. - [Father Wes] We're not here to hurt you, Amanda. We're only trying to help you. - [Amanda] You wanna take him away from me. You can't have him. [Lights shattering] - [Father Wes] I can't see anything. Amanda, Amanda where are you? - [Amanda] We wanna play a game with you, Father. - [Father Wes] Father Thomas turn on the lights. Demon I demand you to release this poor child at once. Our Father, who art in Heaven. [Demon growling] - Make it stop. Oh my God, I can't believe this is happening. - We just have to hold on a little longer. We're gonna make it through this. - How? - Light. In the journal he said he could keep her away with light. - You're right. - How are we supposed to do that? All we have are flashlights. - What do you need? - In the folder we found in the cabinet. - What are you lookin' for? - We found a picture. They were standing next to a generator. - Generator. - The picture we found of these nuns, they're standing by a generator. - You guys, this is her. This is the little girl that Todd and I saw. Amanda Peterson; she's just a little girl. - The ghost girl that has a demon for best friends. - Can we stop her? - Light's the answer. The generator's in the cellar. If we can get down there and turn it on, maybe we can light this place up and get outta here. Does anyone have experience with a generator? - Yeah, I do. My grandparents used to have one on the farm. - Okay, so Ryan and Eric will go down to the cellar and the two of you can go with Todd. - No wait, I don't wanna go anywhere without Eric. - If you don't wanna go with us Karen, you can go with them. Becca and Ryan also go through the halls and try to distract this thing. Radio when it's safe. - Seems like a really stupid idea, guys. - No if they can keep this thing distracted long enough and we can turn the generator on, no one'll get hurt. - What if it's in the cellar with you? - Then you will have to act fast. - I don't really like this idea of us splitting up. - Just trust me, it'll work. We'll be fine. - Okay, we'll go this way. - Wait, take this with you. Set the motion sensor on then put it in the hallway and maybe it can give you a warning of something or someone's coming after you. - Good luck, guys. [Camera beeping] - It's ready. [Walls tapping] - Hey! We're over here! - We're over here! - Come on, come and get us! Come on! [Camera clicking] [ominous music] [demon growling] [Becca screaming Go go go, now now! Run! - There it is. - Oh shit. [Generator grinding] [Ryan grunting] - Okay guys, what's wrong? Why won't it start? - Shine the light. Shit, it's outta gas. - Gas container, look for a gas container. [Intense chase music] [muffled screaming] - Come on! [Becca screaming] [demon growling] [speech drowned by demon growling] No don't get up, [mumbles]! Oh shit! [Speech drowned by Becca screaming] Come on, go go go go! [Ominous music] - There it is. - [Amanda] Turn off the lights. - Amanda, is that you? - [Amanda] You can't play if you turn on the lights. - We don't wanna play your games. - Amanda, we just wanna go home. - [Amanda] I just wanna play. - D'you hear me? We don't wanna play your stupid games, little bitch! - [Amanda] Why are you being so mean? [Amanda screaming] [demon growling] - Oh my God, let's go. You guys, we have to get the generator on. - Let's go! [Muffled speech] [demon growling] [blood splattering] [Amanda chuckling softly] - No, no! Oh my God, no, no! - Karen, we gotta go. We gotta go! - No, Eric no! - Karen, we gotta go! - Come on, it's too late. Come here. [Karen sobbing loudly] - No, Eric! - Don't move, don't move. Here. Where's Eric? - Where the hell are the bandages? - They're right here. - What happened? - This place happened. Oh, sweetie. I don't need your help. - Leave me alone, please. Just leave me alone. [Sobs] - So what do we do now? - [Todd] Could you just give us a minute? - We don't have a minute, Todd. - Eric is dead and her leg's all torn up. Could you please just give us a goddamn minute? [Karen sobbing] - This all your fault. You should be the one dead, not Eric. - You're right, I'm sorry. I was just tryin' to help. I didn't think-- - That's your problem right there, you don't think. - So, what? Are we all gonna just sit here and wait to die? We have to get back to the cellar. Light is the only way to stop this thing. We already found the generator. We just have to fill it with gas, turn it on and then we're home-free. - You know that for a fact? - No I do not know that for a fact, but I have to trust that we will be. I guess I better get used to doing things without you. - [Sighs] Stop being such a bitch, Katie! - Screw you, Todd. I can take care of myself. - Yeah, you made that real clear. - Go ahead. Go off and enjoy your new life and leave the rest of us behind, just like dad did. - You know what? Fuck you, Katie! - Fuck you, Todd! - All right, you're gonna be okay. It's all right. [Karen sobbing] - [Eric] Karen. Karen. - Eric? - It's all my fault. I never should've suggested this place. - Hey, don't say that. We had no idea what we were up against and you couldn't have known. - I can't let anyone else die because of me. I have to get the generator up and running. - It's too dangerous. We should just stay here and wait until morning. - We may not live that long, Ryan. - We have the fireplace. It'll keep us safe. - Does it still hurt? - I'm hangin' in there. - I'm so sorry. - Hey, look at me. Hey, come here. You have nothin' to be sorry for. I would do anything for you. In case we don't make it out of here alive, I just want you to know that. [Both sighing] [Karen breathing heavily] [intriguing piano music] - Eric? Eric? [Ominous banging] [Karen gasping] Please, I don't want to die. - [Amanda] I'm not gonna hurt you. - But your friend will, right? - [Amanda] Only if you don't play the game right. - I just want Eric back and go home. - [Amanda] I know where he is. - Where? - [Amanda] I can't tell you. - Why not? - [Amanda] You have to play the game first and if you win, I'll take you to him. - And if I lose? - [Amanda] You get to stay here with me. If you wanna play, you have to turn off your flashlight. [Ominous music] - Now what? - Come and find me. [Karen breathing heavily] - Okay, okay. Okay, okay. [Door creaking] Eric? Eric, Eric? [Amanda screaming] I'm so sorry, I couldn't see. [Karen screaming] Help me! Help me, no! [Breathes heavily] No, please somebody help me! Somebody! [Breathes heavily] Help me! Help me, please! Somebody help me. Help! [Breathes heavily] Jesus. [Foreboding music] - Karen. - Eric? Eric? [Furniture crashing] [Karen panicking] [demon growling] [Karen screaming] - Did you tell her we were moving? - Yeah. - Well you thought she might act this way. - Yeah, but I thought she might at least be happy for us. - She's your sister. Of course she wants us to be happy, just like you want her to be happy. - Hey, where are you going? - We're gonna smooth things over with Kate. - No no no, just come on, stay here. - No, Todd. - You're hurt. - Yeah, I might die if I just stay here sitting on my ass doing nothing. We're not gonna stay in here. We're gonna get married, have lots of babies and we're not gonna die here. Now, I have a wedding to prepare for and you need to patch things up with my future sister-in-law before it's too late. - I know, that thing hasn't come after us yet. I think the fire's working. Let's just stay put. - I've never known you to be somebody who sits on the sidelines, Todd. - [Huffs] This is different. This isn't a game. - I know this isn't a game. This is our life and you're just sitting here stubborn to help them. Now are you with me or am I doin' this by myself? - I'm with you. I'm with you all the way. - Okay, come on. [Becca wincing] - You shouldn't be walking on that. - I think I'll survive. - Wishful thinking. - Hey. - Sorry, it's hard to be optimistic when most of the people you know are gone. Poor Karen, she... Son of a bitch. - Where'd she go? Karen! - We gotta find her. - No no no, you're not going. It's way too dangerous. - So we're just gonna leave her? - No no Katie, she's right. Becca can't go anywhere, she's hurt. Let's just wait here 'til morning. We'll look for Karen then. - Exactly. - [Huffs] My God, between the two of you just sitting around and doin' nothing, it's pathetic. These are your friends. Our friends. Let's go find them. Fuck this Amanda and fuck this demon. [Fire whooshing] [ominous music] [ominous banging] [everyone shrieking] [furniture crashing] [Becca shrieking] [demon growling] [Becca panting and screaming] - No, Becca! - Let's go. - Becca! - Todd! - Todd! - Todd! - Fuck, Todd! Come on, we'll go around the back. - Where is she?! Come on, you asshole. I'm right here, take me instead. Please, she doesn't deserve this! Becca! [Sobs] [somber cello music] I'm sorry. - Oh shit. - I'm not gonna hurt you. Not gonna hurt you. [Sinister laughing] Stay here with me. [Intense orchestral music] [watch beeping] - Security guard. Oh God, hey! - Hey! Up here! - Hey! - Here! - Up here! Why isn't be seeing us? - I don't know, we need to keep moving. - Are you sure? - Come on. - [Amanda] Not gonna hurt you. - Come on. Let's go back. Shh. [Sinister laughing and growling] Fuck. [Both screaming] [ominous music] - Ryan, what are you doing? - Trust me. - No, Ryan wait! Ryan! - Where are you?! I'm not afraid of you! [Ominous music] - Do you wanna play a game? - I'm not gonna let you hurt her. - She's not playin' the game, silly. You are. You have to come find me. - Just get outta here and leave us alone! - Ryan, play her game. - I'm not gonna play her stupid games! [Ryan breathing heavily] I love you, Kate. - What are you doing? Ryan? - Come on, over here! Come get me! Over here! [Ryan shouting] [Kate sobbing] - Ryan? Ryan! If you just had to play her game. If you just had [inhales] to play her game. You just have to play her game. Todd? Todd? Come in, Todd. Please come in, Todd. - Yeah? - [Kate] I have an idea. - Just give it up, Kate. What's the point? - No listen to me, Todd. I'm not ready to give up. Not yet, not on us. I know what to do but I need you. Please, Todd. We're not giving up. Listen, I have a plan. [Ominous music] Amanda? I wanna play a game. - Do you wanna play a game? - I do, but I wanna be the one who hides. - Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six. I found you. - Todd, now. [Todd grunting] Oh, come on. [Generator roaring] [lights buzzing] [Amanda screaming] [demon growling] [Kate panting] [Kate sobbing] Did it work? - Yes, it worked. [Lights booming] [ominous music] [children laughing] [Kate wincing] [Amanda chuckling] [demon growling] [lights shattering] Run, run! [Todd muffled shouting] - Kate, just go! - I can't leave without you. - You can, please let go. - No no. No! [Door slamming] No no no! No, Todd! Todd, no don't leave. [Sobs] [latch clanking] [Kate sobbing] [foreboding bell music] [birds chirping] [ominous orchestral music] [Kate sighing] - [Girl Voiceover] "To whoever finds this journal, "take warning of this place. "There is a darkness that lives here that cannot be stopped. "Her name is Amanda Peterson. "If you are reading this, my friends and I "did not make it out of the orphanage. "If given the chance, "leave this place at once before it's too late. "However, if you do find yourself "trapped inside the orphanage "once the darkness has fallen upon you, "my only advice is to... "...hide in the light." [Foreboding music] [music fades]
