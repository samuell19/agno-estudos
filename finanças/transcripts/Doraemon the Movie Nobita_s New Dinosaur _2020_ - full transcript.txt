It's Alamoron The toothless pterosaur was flying in the sky! Look, it's a spiny dragon! That's awesome! It's a triceratops. So cool Baba baba baba baba baba Why are you suddenly calling Daddy? Tyrannosaurus rex Do-do-do-do Doraemon Is it okay? Nobita, is everything all right? Hey, hey, what are you afraid of? How can there be real dinosaurs? It's hard to say. What are you talking about? Somewhere in this world, there might still be dinosaurs alive. So, Nobita... Dinosaurs disappeared 66 million years ago. Why The Earth was hit by a huge meteorite and the dinosaurs became extinct. How could It's huge! That's great That's a flake dragon. Nobita Huh It seems to have something Where is it? Where is it? That's it. This is a fossilized dinoflagellate It's great! That's great, Fat Tiger. Let me see The fossil you found, you can take it back. Last 5 years Many dinosaur fossils have been found in Japan Japan may have been a dinosaur kingdom. Excuse me, is this a dinosaur fossil? That's impressive. No doubt it's a dinosaur's No way! 00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,290 An ordinary stone that trips over your foot How could Nobita find the fossil of a dinosaur 00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,350 If shit, it's possible to find it. What's a fossil? I'm here to announce Not some fossil. I'm going to find a living dinosaur and show you. Nobita Okay, I'm recording. What are you going to do if you don't find it? What do you do? 00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,290 Table: Showing you how to chew peanuts with your eyes Here we go again. How exciting! The video of the evidence was also well captured Wait for me. I'll find a live dinosaur and leave those guys speechless. In the world There are still many undiscovered dinosaurs That should have existed in the course of evolution, but were not discovered. It hurts. A new dinosaur buried in a transitional fossil like that Perhaps it's up to you to discover it. At that time it will be possible to name the dinosaur after you Doraemon Doraemon doraemon doraemon doraemon doraemon Doraemon Doraemon Doraemon Doraemon: Nobita's New Dinosaur Dinosaur eggs? Oh, you're so Naive or innocent, I should say. Give me back this shape, this size It's a dinosaur egg from any angle. Such naivety. It's a good thing that you say it's a good thing that you are But then How do you know it's a dinosaur egg? It could just be an ordinary stone. Even if it's a fossil, it could be the fruit of an ancient tree. 00:08:21,790 It could be the poop of an archaic rhinoceros. It's a bit of a bummer. So Just to be sure, take out the time wrap. If you wrap it in a time wrap and rewind time you will be able to tell if this is a dinosaur egg or not It's not. What are you going to do if it's really a dinosaur's egg after doing that? I'll keep it. It's too hard for Nobita Why 00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,770 To raise a life like this It's not as easy as you think And raising dinosaurs in a world where they're extinct 00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,870 And they're so pathetic. Before thinking about that kind of thing like a dream Learn how to take care of yourself first Give me back my gumbo! That means Doraemon believes it's a dinosaur egg, too. No, it's not. If you don't believe me, take out the time wrapper. It'll just end up as shit anyway Time wrapped towel That's fine I can't wait! Could it be a Triceratops or a Brachiosaurus? I told you it's the poop of an Archaeopteryx. I don't know, it could be a Tyrannosaurus. Mum, what's for dinner today? Huh? Nothing's changed. Sure enough, it's probably just an ordinary stone. Nobita also needs to sleep well Good night Good night Nobita, get up! It's itchy, Doraemon Glasses Glasses What's up, Nobita? Do Doraemon No, not sure it's a dinosaur yet. It's going to be born Gotta get the hot water going Ambulance. Ambulance. And... and... It's a dinosaur. So cute. Huh Do... Doraemon. Double Yolk Egg How rare! Thanks to the time wrapped scarf The twin dinosaurs inside the egg grow up Slow down. It's dangerous. That's great. You can walk already. This child won't come out. Look, it's not scary. Come on out. So warm So, your name is Khoo. And you are Mew Kew and Mew? It's got little feathers. It's lovely. What kind of dinosaur is this? Let's investigate The Complete Encyclopedia of the Universe Speaking of dinosaurs with feathers Dinosaur and also Chironomus Not this one. Not this one either. Oops How can This dinosaur has not been recorded It must be a new species of dinosaur. If that's the case, it's a big find. Name it Nobita Dinosaur But, Nobita, you can't keep them here. If Mom or anyone else finds out, it'll be a big deal. No, I want to keep it. I'll show them to Fat Tiger and Little Husband when they're old enough. And leave them speechless Please, Doraemon, can you just grow a little bit bigger? Really, really cute. Look at that. Isn't that nice? You can only keep them until they grow up. Great! Please tell me more, Mew. I'm full What's wrong? You're eating so fast. Dad Thank you Nobita, you've left the green peppers again, haven't you? I ate it. Mum, I'll have another bowl of miso soup too. Okay, okay. Eh, there's a lot left. It's not good to be a picky eater. I'm full You're hungry, aren't you? Come on, eat. Eat up eat up Come on, Kew, eat too. Not eating? It's obviously so tasty So, this Ming Miao will eat Kew if you don't eat properly What's wrong? 00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,640 Mew will eat it, but Kew won't. I don't care Hello? You said you wanted to keep them, but you said so yourself, Nobita! I feel like you guys are so much alike Who are you talking about and who are you talking about? Because Nobita is just like their parents. We have to think of more ways What do dinosaurs eat anyway? What kind of place do they live in? It's a fossilized plant. It's beautiful. Hello Please teach me how to keep dinosaurs How to breed What kind of nest to sleep in, what kind of food to eat, etc. That's it. When it comes to dinosaurs, there are also carnivorous and herbivorous species. 00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,900 And how did that dinosaur look like Also related to how it lived For example Although like a lizard But with feathers So, why don't we find out what lizards and birds eat? Do they live near the mountains or do they live near the sea? In this case the food would be different again Oh, a dinosaur with feathers. Nobita, little Dora, time to eat Today it's sashimi with tuna I had a nice tuna today, so I went for the luxury This is what Nobita likes to eat I'm on. I'm on Eat up It's delicious. Eat up. No? Eaten That's good, that's good. One more. Oh, that's good. It hurts. It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts Really, Khoo. Good pain, good pain, good pain It's not good Nobita What's wrong with you? It's so late. How can I cure the dinosaur? Please I checked it with the medical kit It should get better. Come on, Khoo. Seems to have fallen asleep Nobita, go to sleep too! Good boy. Good boy. Kew I'm going out Late. Late. Nobe, look what time it is! You go and stand in the corridor. Yamada Kawamura Izumo Sugi Nobe Nobe Nobuo I'm calling you. What the hell! to to Sending you yesterday's question paper It's not 0 marks What kind of guy is happy with 3 points? Win! That's good. Keep it up. Come on, Nobita. Come on, Nobita! Come on, one more time. Very good Not even close. That's it. Oh, it's great to have Nobita on the bottom It's really great I feel a little bit more confident. It's true Hm When you've seen grown up Kew and Mew Don't cry afterwards I'm back Xiao Qiu Xiao Miao Welcome home Did Mew just fly? Yes, I was shocked too. Khoo, Khoo, fly over here too. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. But... it hurts. 00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,910 If it becomes capable of flying, it won't be able to keep it in the room. It's only a matter of time before mum finds out. Why? Can't you do anything about it? Yes, I'll look for it. Diorama set for breeding This is a diorama for keeping animals or bugs Diorama? First decide on the terrain That's about right, isn't it? Then it's with this In the words of the fast miniatures manufacturing camera No matter what it is, it can be turned into a small part. You can arrange them freely inside awesome But... it's going to be discovered. Don't worry, it's here. With size adjustment Size can also be adjusted freely And then, if you reduce the size with the reduction light Really wide What's up, Nobita? If people are here, no one can find them. Okay, I've decided to build one here just for us. Nobe Dinosaur Land. Yoo-hoo Wrong! Do the math again! It's so noisy! This way. This way. Maths homework is difficult That's right, it's really hard Hey Nobita Did you find the dinosaur? Than practising the bar flip How about practising chewing peanuts with your eyes? No more practice It doesn't bother me if I can't do this kind of thing This is a safe place. I'm coming too. I'm coming too! This is it! Do it, do it! Mew, that's great! In that case, I want them to be able to soar under the blue sky That's fine. This diorama has a weather adjustment function What about, for example Come on, it's Kew next. A slide? I think this should allow Kew to practice flying That's right Come on, Kew. Come here. Right now Is that okay? Let's try again. With practice. You'll be able to fly like a mu It doesn't seem to like it You can't do that. It just failed once. If that happens, you won't be able to support yourself for long. How dare you say such things, Nobita! What a mouthful It seems to be saying that it's OK to have this Really But why can't Kew fly? It obviously looks exactly the same Speaking of which, Mew's tail is a bit longer Kew's tail is much shorter Really! And Kew is much smaller than Mew I didn't realise I'd grown up so much It's time to... I understand What was it that Nobita said would be important That goes without saying. Definitely no dinosaurs to be found Performing the peanut chewing with the eyes as promised Show us What is it? What is it? What is it? What is this? What is this? It's a real dinosaur. This one is even better with all the fat! Bastard, that's what a friend should say! Me, me, me... I'm skinny as a bone. I can't believe I'm eating peanuts Nobita what the hell is going on here? This is the new dinosaur I found, Nobita Dinosaur. This is Khoo. That's Mew over there. Don't be afraid All three of them are my good friends I'm so sorry. What's that scream? Nobita Oh no, it's Mom. Doraemon. No problem. Reducing the light Why is it a can of locusts That's strange. Anything is good. Get it out. That's it. Space Mobile Crayon Use this red crayon to circle the range You can then move to the position circled by the white crayon Don't illustrate at this point Maharishi Nobita Hello, Auntie Beautiful today too. I've been hearing barks lately There's also inexplicably less food in the fridge Did you have kittens and puppies in the house I swear I don't have a cat or a dog Is that so? That's weird. If it's actually a dinosaur that's being raised 00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,680 Mom would have been scared to death Oh no. Mum! Is that a dinosaur? It's true. It's a dinosaur no matter how you look at it. Do... Doraemon. Gone Where the hell did it go? All right, next up is Kew. You've both grown so much Nobita It is no longer possible to continue to feed them in this era Mew is already higher than me. For them Wouldn't it be better to live with your mates But where do we send them back to? Back to the time when they existed, right? If you work backwards from the time spent on the Time Wrapper is from the late Cretaceous Go to that time with a time machine Let Kew and Mew return to their companions I don't want it! Absolutely not! Nobita Nobita I understand that it hurts to be apart But you can't stay together forever This wasn't their world in the first place. But Kew can't fly yet. If we send it back to the age of dinosaurs, it's not going to survive! But that's the principle We can't change history And if you grow with your companions Kew can definitely fly too So, Nobita Tomorrow. Tomorrow, the two of us. Let's send Kew and Mew back to the Cretaceous Okay, it's late. Let's go back. This kind of thing Of course I understand Well done. Well done. Maharishi Khoo and Mew I was born from the egg because of my caprice So I had to protect them. Let's go. To the Cretaceous! Go in search of Kew and Mew's companions Nobita! Fat Tiger, Little Fu, Shizuka That costume is going to You were planning to go to the Cretaceous anyway! You're not going to leave us behind, are you? I'd like to come along too If I can be of any help, just ask. Guys Everybody, are you ready? Sure. The heart is beating Departure To the Cretaceous Engine start Battery charge 1200% Time space navigation system fully operational Destination 66 million years ago in Cretaceous Japan Hold on tight, folks! Doraemon Where are we now? About 600 years ago 6,000 years ago It was the time when the Egyptian civilization of the Nile Valley flourished I know this one. Time of the birth of man It was about 2.5 million years ago And the Cretaceous period we're going to is More than 60 million years ago Now about one ten thousandth of a mile away One ten thousandth You'll have to wait in here a little longer. There will be occasional shaking, so hold on tight Doraemon This is the Cretaceous Period? Well, we've gone back 66 million years. Okay, let's go. Wait! We're going to the Cretaceous later. The temperature is very different from now. 00:38:05,690 and the concentration of oxygen was also different than in our time And so? Expedition set This suit is waterproof, windproof and coldproof in every way It can be adapted to a wide variety of environments and thus protects itself It feels like an expedition now. Super suitable So let's go This is Japan in the Cretaceous period Come out This is your hometown! What is it? Next, so that we don't get separated. Locating the square scarf Put this scarf around your neck like this This button is the signal transmitter When expanded, it becomes a map This way we know where each other are at all times Does that work? So cute Mew wants to put it on too, right? We're the same colour Kew also wears That's good. Then set off in search of Qiu and Miao's companions I'll be the first to find them. Me too Why can't I see dinosaurs anywhere? You're so ignorant, Fat Tiger. This is Japan. How can there be large dinosaurs? What's wrong, fat tiger? What's the matter? This way Wait, Fat Tiger. JD Dragon It's a real dinosaur Won't they attack us? Stegosaurus is a herbivore So just get close to it and you won't have any problems To be precise, they're close relatives of Stegosaurus. So it's true. There were many dinosaurs in Japan. But something doesn't feel right. What do you mean? Isn't Stegosaurus a Jurassic dinosaur? What do you mean? Indeed, Stegosaurus is a Jurassic dinosaur. If that's the case, this is 100 million years older than the Cretaceous. Jurassic is correct. 100 million years But it shouldn't be Does it mean that Isn't that an Allosaurus that lived in the Jurassic? It's not the Cretaceous period. It's the Jurassic But why would Sorry I may have accidentally pressed the wrong destination for the time machine What the hell are you doing, Nobita? You nerd Everybody run full speed back to the time machine Run! Nobita, come on! Wait for me Run away! Nobita, come on! Wait for me Quick Went to the Cretaceous? Call Dr. Gill. So crowded Nobita, what about the diorama set? I just lost it. Really, what can I say about you? You're not going to get it wrong this time, are you? Yes. No mistake. This is Cretaceous Japan. That's great. That's great! Doraemon It must be here! Nobita, Shizuka, Kew and Mew are counting on you. Okay, let's go! Come on, Kew. Little Mew This is Japan in the Cretaceous period To be precise, the islands of Japan were not yet formed at this time. It is still part of a huge continent Look over there! That's awesome! It's the real Alamosaurus This is too big Look over there. That's awesome It's like a dinosaur kingdom Is this the home of Kew and Mew? Flight practice Flight practice Kew's not a birdie. Don't give him a hard time. All right, let's go. Sorry sorry sorry Say it's this way! You know what? How can What a beautiful lake Look around here Why can't I see dinosaurs anywhere? Are they extinct? How is that possible? It's difficult because it's a new dinosaur, so there's no habitat in the database. What are the clues? Yeah. Footprint stamp Footprint stamp? Kew, come here. Lend me your feet for a while Ready What is this It's a footprint. If you stamp the ground like this A footprint of the same shape will glow I can't believe there are so many footprints This is it. Look, these footprints are all going in the same direction. It must be a mass migration. But why is that? Report the number! Doraemon What's this? Egg Expedition They'll help us find the footprints So cute I'm counting on you then This is not edible Is it really okay? Stop talking nonsense and get after it! No, it'll be dangerous if we fall behind. Let's camp here today Camping Balloon Sleep in this tonight This way. This way. There are rooms for everyone. Choose your favourite. That's great. I'll take this one. It's so slick. Soft Awesome Great Great And what else? Raise the balloon like this And you won't be attacked by the beast! That's great! Unbelievable, isn't it? We are now, 66 million years ago. What a great meteor shower! There are monkeys in this era? It's not surprising if there were Of course, I'm keeping an eye on them. Got it. What do we do? Catch them now? A little more observation Understand Surely a new dinosaur Why Information about footprints came in from the egg expedition Where exactly are they heading? Anyway, let's go. Okay, everybody, don't get separated. All right? Is it true that you passed through here? What's wrong, Kew? Doraemon Back! Yes, it's a toothless pterodactyl. No, this is their lair. Everybody, run away at full speed. Kew Doraemon Do these guys want to eat us? This is better. Is this what friends do? No, no, they're not here to attack us. It looks like they're in a panic because they've been scared by something. 00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,670 Everybody take refuge in the forest below We're saved! Doraemon Here are the footprints Really Egg Expedition Footprints continue in front of this Thank you for your hard work This is not edible Be careful, everyone! There's no telling what kind of dinosaurs are lurking around here. How so Dora, don't scare us! You'll save us if we're in danger, right? Whatever it is that's coming My lord would have sent it flying Rats are scary. Rats are scary. Oh, really. Don't make a fuss. There are animals like rats in this day and age. Are you hungry, fat tiger? It's not me Want some chewing gum? I told you it wasn't me. Baba Baba Baba... What's with the dad again? Tyrannosaurus rex! Look here Momotaro Rice Ball Broken Cannot be eaten Nothing else? Nothing else? There you are. Chocolate partner. Chocolate at a time like this Divide this chocolate into two before giving it to the others Then you can become friends with each other is now not possible I'm not a civet There should be more Somebody help! I'll take care of that. It's so easy. What's going on? What are you doing? Let go! Pain, pain, pain Really? Your name is Gale. Great, Fat Tiger. That's awesome! Everyone, let me introduce you My friend from the heart, Gail That's nice, Fat Tiger. Sharing partner chocolates with each other after becoming partners You can acquire each other's characteristics and abilities within one hour If you become friends with a dinosaur 00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:10,940 then we can protect ourselves from being attacked in our search for Kew and Mew's companion Good idea. Let's all become friends with our favourite dinosaur That's great! Dinosaur sauce. Dinosaur sauce. With I want to be friends with little Mew Same as Mew If you don't mind, can you be my friend? That's awesome. Let's do it too We're going, Kew. Let's fly Pain, pain, pain, pain The flightless Qiu and Nobita are a perfect match Triceratops Only one horn. It must be one of its kind. It's called a trophy. Please tell me more, Topper. A friend of a friend is also a good friend It's okay. One day, Kew will fly too. Although I'm not qualified to say that either Everyone, let's go! And then It's the sea. The footprints have disappeared There are many footprints Good work, everyone It seems that the footprints break off here Where the hell did it go? It didn't fall into the sea, did it? It can't be It must be around here. Then let's split up and look for it. That's too dangerous. What's the matter, little Dora? Are you scared? We have Gale and Topper with us. All right then. But be careful In case it doesn't work in the middle of the day, take this with you We'll use the scarf to confirm each other's positions I see Let's go too Fat Fat Tiger These are Are they all dinosaur skeletons? Let's go back. What are you afraid of? What's wrong? Even Gale is like that. Topper too, like he's afraid of something. And I feel like I've been watched since a while ago. See, Fat Tiger? Let's go after it Uh-huh. Gere and Topper are waiting for us right here. Don't worry about it. We'll be right back Junior Expedition Departure Follow Me Purple Team Purple crew? This is Cretaceous actually existed in this kind of place Some bad guys would poach dinosaurs and sell them for a high price I've heard Doraemon say that before Okay, let's both find out. Let's go, purple team. If I'm purple, what's a fat tiger? The captain is red of course Not orange Don't let me hear the word orange again Yes Red Hey, look at this! This is Similar to Kew and Mew Found it! Catch it! Wait for me! Sure enough it's that monkey Very good. Go on, purple. Why me? Red as captain should take the lead at times like this Scouting is a subordinate's job, isn't it? Come on, purple. No, no, no. Red please. Purple Red Purple You're a bit noisy, aren't you? It's orange Old Mother Mum Really What a brave expedition The Monkey Speaks You... You saved us, didn't you? Half right Yes Yes people However, the other half of the answer is wrong Sure enough all the footprints disappeared off the coast Little Dora What's this one? Is that a footprint of something? No, if it is, it's too big. What's wrong, Mew? Qiu Do-Do-Do Doraemon So Big Everyone, use the bamboo dragonfly to escape! Xiao Qiu Fly up, Khoo Fly Up Nobita Flying up Khoo is flying up Da Xiong Nobita Qiu Kew Open Door Bastard! Let us out! Where's this ship going? How do I know about such things Is everything okay, Fat Tiger? Damn it, can't I? If it had such sharp teeth it would have broken the lock There is still this solution O Friend of the Heart No mistake, it's Nobita's signal Must have been swept away by the current Little Dora, Nobita, he must be okay. The expedition set should protect him, right? Nobita Good Boy Here How did we get saved? Can we climb up? Nobita Doraemon Great, you're all right. Nobita Shizuka I'm so worried about you It's really good that you're okay But... what is this island? I just saw a dinosaur that looks exactly like Kew and Mew So, here's the new dinosaur... What are you going to do? It looks like they've reached the island too. That's pretty good. You're really taking it in stride That island is a decisive place for the planet If anything changes because of them I understand everything Already caught two of them Hurry up and get away! How can I go back after being screwed so badly? But why this island? The new alternative dinosaurs are the underdogs, forced into a life on the move Finally cornered on a cliff by the sea And from there gliding all the way to the island Achieved a solitary boom Even so, the island is still a mystery It looks like it leads to a very deep place Kew, wait! What's wrong? So that was Go after it Little Mew Let's go too Quickly Khoo So spectacular Look! Mew is already with them Qiu, they are your companions Go on! No, the battery is dead. Is it okay? Qiu Stop it, Mew! That's too much Khoo too Qiu is also your partner Why That's because Because it can't fly? Because it's small? Because of the short tail? In that case I would definitely Help Kew learn to fly Nobita Not much time left before meteorite impact It's almost time to get the kids under control Otherwise everyone could be buried here will die? Can you wait a little longer? This new dinosaur is slightly different from all the individuals so far And, about the enigmatic island 01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:25,810 Perhaps we will soon be able to find out what it really is However, if we have less than two hours left, we'll be on the island too. I see Try again. Don't be afraid. This is not working Whether mu or other similar Neither will flutter their wings like that One more time That's not how you fly. Why can't you do it? I'm sure you can do it too. Just a little more effort Qiu Fool Nobita What just happened If Kew wants to survive in this world you must learn to fly But I'm not really in a position to say such things I can't do either the race or the test or the bar. No such thing Nobita knows the pain and sorrow of others and can give companionship and dependence This is the kind of Nobita I like 01:17:35,020 01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:43,280 Khoo must be waiting for Nobita too Thank you, Shizuka. Here Seeker's Cane Thanks a lot Looks like we've reached the island Let's get out of here while we still can, Fat Tiger. Fat Tiger Come on, Purple Do you want to continue investigating here? Look at this! I mean, you don't look like an explorer, you look like a thief. Who the hell are those guys? Is this a thumbnail sketch of the island? I feel like I've seen it somewhere before Could this island be We need to inform everyone quickly I'm sorry for saying such a mean thing. I obviously can't even do one thing myself But one day I'm going to learn how to flip a bar too So, Khoo too Don't give up so easily, Khoo too That's the deal between us Meteor Little Dora The one just now was This can't be Little Dora, this is How could I be so stupid? I can't believe I didn't even notice such a thing Doraemon Shizuka Fat Tiger Little Husband I'm glad you got here safely. What the hell just happened compared to this? Does it mean that this is Nobita Gentlemen Doraemon What the hell is going on here? This is exactly 66 million years ago. as expected So that was a meteorite that just fell? No way. Meteorite crashes into Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico The meteorite stirred up dust that would have spread over the whole earth What would be the result of that? There's no danger on this side, is there? Mexico is on the far side of the world, isn't it? Dust from the fall of a giant meteorite It will be accompanied by a heat wave sweeping the world Burning everything on the surface of the earth to the ground After this the cumulus clouds will block out the sun for a long time The temperature of the Earth is thus lowered The dinosaur metropolis Don't I can't believe it's going to end like this But Doraemon will find a way to solve the problem, right? Just like it always does Sorry Nobita I Can't Change History Nobita Nobita, stop it! Nobita No. What do you want to do? This is it That's the reversing clock. Give it back to me! Little Dora I'm going to use it to reverse time and send the meteor back into the universe Stop it, Nobita! This is the end Time Patrol Now leave the two new dinosaurs over there immediately Boarding Time Ship Otherwise you will be arrested for time crimes Arrested? Fat Tiger In other words Sorry for the bad memories 01:24:24,930 To prevent history from being changed, we have been monitoring the times I say, can't we really help Kew and Mew? I've been studying dinosaurs for a long time because I like them too I can understand how you feel 1,000 01:24:35,690 --> 01:24:38,610 But, sorry, we can't do anything to save them. This is too cruel The falsification of history must not be allowed If you stop the meteor from falling, it's not just you. None of you will ever be born How can this be The mammals only flourished when the dinosaurs died out And that's how humans came to be I'm not going to save you from death I could never do such a thing I want to reverse time and send the meteor back to the universe Can't do it, Nobita. Keep him under control Be honest with me Stop it! Got him under control. I want to protect Khoo and Mew Stop What's wrong with this guy? This guy We're here to help too I'm not going to let you arrest Nobita Nobita is just trying to protect Khoo and Mew Mum Only a few hours left before the heatwave arrives here Get everyone out of here. One moment Can you give me a little more time? Stop it, Jill. Everyone will be burned to the ground. What Untie the boy! Don't interfere with anything they do What the hell is going on here, Jill? sure enough as you can see We cannot interfere with their actions How about witnessing the moment when history is made 01:26:42,860 What about the Time Patrol? They're not approaching us. What the hell is going on here? The guy using is checking the card Will react in case history is about to be rewritten That it reacted to Nobita and Kew would mean I can't imagine this kind of teenager who has the word ordinary written on his face How to Change History Pingfan is still really sorry for you But Nobita was so handsome just now No, I'm trying my hardest So what should we do next? That would be to save the dinosaurs, naturally But how do we do it? About that, right, Fat Tiger? That's right, our Junior Expedition. We've made a big discovery It's better to see than to hear What the hell is going on? Look at that mountain. Does it look familiar? Like what? That's what I thought before It feels like a slide on that hill In that case Then this is Single Pole This is Tyre Jumper This hill has three holes I see This is the concrete pipe in the open space Then here is Maharishi There's no mistake, this is Nobe Dinosaur Land I can't believe it's written as Inuyasha again No doubt it's Nobita's handwriting The dinosaurs' lair is actually a climbing frame I see Device dropped in the Jurassic damaged the size adjustment got bigger between 100 million years And so in the long years It became just like an island of nature ah That's right. If the island is a diorama set, then it has a weather adjustment function It should protect the dinosaurs from outside disasters Awesome But what about the dinosaurs off the island? Then Can we use that prop? The prop that moved Qiu and Miao to the roof There's still this one And this? That means space moving crayon Fat Tiger, Xiao Fu, Shizuka, Miao You go to the mainland outside the island Gather the dinosaurs in one place as far as you can Use this red crayon to draw a circle around them Nobita Khoo and I will Drawing a circle around the island with a white crayon Press this button when you have finished drawing Move all the dinosaurs from outside the island to here Awesome This way everyone is saved Great, Khoo Mew! But time is running out Let's finish before the heatwave hits, although it's extremely dangerous But we still have hope Okay, let's do it. Okay, let's start the battle to save the dinosaurs. They're acting a little suspicious. If something goes wrong, can you take responsibility for it? This could become A decisive moment in the evolutionary history of living things Can we wait a little longer? One more hour Take them away when the time is up Got it Let's go too Kew is waiting here There are no more working bamboo dragonflies It doesn't matter, Kew will be able to fly too. I thought we had a date Let's go Nobita Enclose the whole island as large as possible Danger It's that guy again Why is it here Flying away Over there is the dinosaurs' lair Oh no, Nobita continues to draw down Doraemon I can't believe it's not working so big That one is It's too dangerous, isn't it? Is it coming? Shizuka drawing as big a circle as she can here Let's go lure all the dinosaurs over here Got it. Look at that Oh no. That's the heat wave that exterminated the dinosaurs Hurry up Egg Expedition Let's get these guys to help out too Please. This is not edible But how do we get the dinosaurs to listen to us? This is where we need to use that, isn't it Fat Tiger? That's right. Gere Torp You're here too, my friend of the heart. I'm so glad you're all right. Gert Torp They don't understand what people say They always listen to what their friends say, don't they? Air Cannon This way By the way, if you make him smaller with the shrinking light Shrinking Lamp Why are all the cans of locusts Doraemon Oh no Run, Kew! Come this way Run, Kew! I said run, run, run! Come on, come on, run, Kew. This way! Come this way! Come on, this way! Everybody, this way! Don't panic Done Please, just a little slower. Do you want to keep reading? At this rate their lives will be in danger too Wait a little longer. Wait a little longer. Kew Come on, it's Khoo's turn this time! Come on, Khoo, this way. It's too dangerous. Let's get out of here. Wait a minute. Look, the new dinosaur. Come on, Khoo. This won't work Whether it's mu or something else like that Neither will flutter their wings like that It's okay, right? With practice, you'll be able to fly just like Mew! Kew, you can fly. I must too Someday I'll definitely learn to flip the bar too So, Khoo too Don't give up so easily, Khoo too Fly! Fly Fly up Go Go Go Fly up, Kew! Khoo! Your name is Khoo Flying up Kew Flying up Khoo So good It's flying. You're not flying. Here we go again Oops, here it is Where's Nobita? Doraemon Nobita Watch me, this time for sure Tinned Locusts! Coming out Nobita, just like that, flying straight over Doraemon Shrinking Lamp Success Doraemon Nobita, we don't have time. Get the crayons out. After that, it's all yours. Just go like that Flying up Flying up This is the moment of evolution That awkward looking movement Is that the precursor to soaring wings? That's how dinosaurs once learned to fly on wings from gliding Took the first step to evolve into a bird We are now witnessing this moment of evolution They didn't go extinct but became birds to survive If the boy hadn't been here Guarding the words of that new dinosaur The history of the earth may be about to change Shizuka Xiaowu Xiaofu Pretty much all in one place Still haven't connected with Doraemon? Hey, little Dora. Shizuka, how's it going over there? Ready to go. Do it! It's burning. Okay, ready to move. Khoo, come on! III Running out of crayons Saw it Zero Nobita, are you sure you don't want to say goodbye? Saying goodbye will only make the separation more painful It's our turn now. Let's go back to our time. 01:43:17,770 --> 01:43:19,810 Take care, Gull. We'll always be good friends Thank you, Topper. See you later Take care! Don't come with me. You can't come with me. You have to survive here Be sure to stay alive I'm sure you'll make it Khoo, take care. Miao Goodbye Goodbye Someday We'll meet again A Heart for Others Perhaps this feeling is something that only humans have evolved to be able to produce Like the dinosaurs evolved the ability to fly on wings Humans have also evolved a wealth of emotions Looking at them makes me think this way Nobita I can't keep sleeping in even if I'm on summer vacation Get up! It's turning over Everyone, isn't it wonderful? We'll see you next time
