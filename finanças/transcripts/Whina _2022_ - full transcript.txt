Sabotage my drainage, send your daughter in to do your dirty work. Oh, some chief. MULDER: This chief built the church that you pray in, Mr. Montgomery. Given the circumstances, the officers decided that a warning is an appropriate measure. So, I do hope that you can agree with him.

Maori owned 66 million acres of land in our country, Aotearoa New Zealand. Then our ancestors signed the Treaty of Waitangi... and today... we barely have two million acres left. - Bastards. - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] My father once said... "Never sell your land... even if you're down to your last penny."

[SIGHS] [CARLA SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] [KISSES] [FIRE CRACKLING] [IN ENGLISH] In the gumfields today, there was talk of a new land scheme. And why would the government help us? Banks won't even give us loans. It would put our land in their debt, but if we work the land hard enough, we could pay the debt back. And if we can't? They'd be setting us up to fail, you know that. [IN MAORI] [IN ENGLISH] Apirana Ngata is holding a meeting in Rotorua, and I would like to go. They won't want a woman there. [♪♪♪] APIRANA: [IN MAORI] [IN ENGLISH] This land scheme means machinery and equipment. It will give you the ability to farm your land in a new and modern way, yielding results that otherwise would be impossible. I believe this is an opportunity. This is an opportunity for Maori to run their farms at the same pace, if not faster, than the Pakeha. [IN MAORI] [IN ENGLISH] This is a new era... and we must be ready. WILLIAM: You look at these as if you'd never seen anything like them before. I haven't. We don't have carvings in our houses in the North. No? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I've heard about the North's embrace of the Catholic Church. The Church has nothing to do with it. The Church encourages our culture. And yet your maraehave no carvings.

[IN MAORI] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [NEWS STING PLAYING ON RADIO] NEWS REPORTER: [IN ENGLISH] Good morning from the New Zealand Broadcasting Service. Sir Apirana Ngata has begun preparations for the Waitangi centennial celebrations to be held at Waitangi on the sixth of February, 1940. This momentous occasion marks 100 years since the British and Maori people signed New Zealand's founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi. [GUNSHOT] [GUN COCKS] [GUN COCKS] [GUNSHOT] So, that's all you do. You line it up... [GUN COCKS] ...and you breathe out slowly, and you squeeze. You'd better listen to her, son. Hey, Dad. Your mother's Panguru's sharp-shooting champion. WHINA: Not anymore. I doubt they'd find anyone better. [GUNSHOT] [SIGHS] Doesn't get it from me. [♪♪♪] [CUTLERY CLATTERING] Have you given more thought to what we talked about? It's been seven years since we left Panguru, Whina. [BREATHES DEEPLY] WILLIAM: The land's no good anymore. Kauri gum gone. No logging. [SLURPS] WILLIAM: It's gonna be harder and harder to make a living. The best thing we can do for the children now is get them an education. Use their heads... not their hands. And the schools in Auckland will allow them to do that. What's the talk around the Waitangi centennial? I wouldn't know. The committee will have their hands full. Well, if they're organized, they'll be fine. We used to do that sort of thing all the time. Not with the numbers they're talking about. - [TABLE THUMPS] - Well, that's their problem, then, isn't it? Mum. We'll take them. Thank you. I agree. The land is no good. They must use their heads now. [PIGS OINK] [WHINA SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Good job. [WHINA SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Good girl. Whina. You would've heard about the Treaty centennial coming up. [♪♪♪] Sometimes I wonder what we're celebrating. Our land sold from under us. The power of our chiefs in the dust. Our culture... scattered. But if things are to change... we must change them. [BREATHES DEEPLY] I need people I can trust in positions of responsibility. I am hoping... you will be one of those people. I'm not sure I am one of those people, Api. Whatever you have been, through... Whina... I know how capable you are. What is it you'd like me to do? WILLIAM: Catering? He's not serious? It's an important job. WILLIAM: It's beneath you, Whina. - Well, someone has to do it. - That someone is not you. You should be welcoming the dignitaries, not cooking for them. Well, perhaps he's right, Wiri. All our choices have consequences. [LOCK CLICKS] [♪♪♪] Stand up.

But it is the way you have done it that is the problem. How are we to bring our people together when they are constantly leaving in anger? Every day, I navigate not only tribal differences but Maori and Pakeha worlds. I do it... because I believe in a future... where we are closer together... not further apart.

I've asked them to send their master carvers. They will teach us. Let me get this straight. You want to build a marae where women can speak... with carvings made by another iwi? A meeting hall, not a marae. And yes. I only hope Te Arawa agree. JOSEPH: Mum. Mum! Te Arawa... they're here. They've come to join us.

And I saw all of my old relations. [GASPS] And then I saw Jesus. Oh! Oh! [CHUCKLES] I could barely look at him. And I said, "Oh... please, Lord... I want to be here with you and my husband now." - And he said, "No." - [CROWD LAUGHS] He said, "You have much more to do." And, oh, well, now I know why the dear Lord left me here.

The ones that are watching us, waiting for any reason to shut us down? Then we just won't get caught, - Whaea. - WHINA: Too late. Get your stuff.

[IN MAORI] WHINA: [IN ENGLISH] Not a marae, a meeting house. A home where our young men from war can return to. [IN MAORI] [IN ENGLISH] You insult our maraeby building this. - [TOOLS CLACKING] - You insult Te Rarawa and the people of Waipuna, and you cause further insult by bringing in carvers from Te Arawa. I know we haven't always seen eye to eye, but this isn't about our past anymore, Whina. You need to stop what you're doing. You need to send the Te Arawa carvers home. - [WHINA SIGHS] - Or this will all end badly. If I had consulted... do you really think that they would've let me do it? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] WHINA: That's the first time I've seen him smile since he came home. [♪♪♪] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] WHINA: Gabriel. - [IN MAORI] How're you? [KISSES] - GABRIEL: Good.

[♪♪♪] These are our taniwha. Araiteuru... Niniwa. They are the guardians of the Hokianga harbor... the protectors of our land. They will help to heal our people. And God, Whina? How have you healed things with him? William and I are married now. We intend to live the rest of our lives in accordance with the church. I believe that God has forgiven us. I would hope you feel the same. That's between yourself and God. Thank you for the tour. [BELL TOLLING] With my work here coming to an end... I've had a lot on my mind. So, wondering what I've achieved... and worrying about what the future might hold for Panguru. I would like to express... my immediate concerns, and I hope you hear the urgency of my words. "Thou shalt have no other gods... before me." "And thou shalt not make... for yourself... an image... in the form of anything... in the heaven above, or on the earth beneath or in the waters below." So, yesterday, I bore witness... to wooden carvings... that were perhaps... the most offensive... and grotesque idols one could possibly imagine. Reproductive organs... They were on full display. There were idols giving birth. Do you know, it was disturbing. Disgusting imagery that no Christian - should ever be exposed to. - Excuse me, Father... - but you are wrong. - Oh, how dare you. You should not preach about things you do not understand. Trying to threaten us with damnation? We here are the Lord's most loyal servants. And who are you to speak to me - in my church like this? - My father built this church! And I'm not going to sit here and listen to you preach ignorance. Come on. And anyone else who agrees with me. [SIGHS] People are quick to be angry. They'll come round. You'll see. [SIGHS] The problem with people is that they can't see what they need until you put it right in front of them. [CHUCKLES] What?

I'm sorry. You'll have to come back tomorrow. No, please. We need help. We have nowhere to stay. - This is not a halfway house. - No, it is a house of God. "He who oppresses the poor shows contempt for their maker... but whoever is kind to the needy honors God." MAN: Brought my family here for work. - [MAN 2 COUGHING] - MAN: But there isn't any. Couldn't find anywhere to live, so... [INDISTINCT CHATTER] ...my... my wife, she... she left. [MAN 2 COUGHING] Took my two... two baby girls with her. What about marae? - Where do our people gather? - [SCOFFS] I don't know. The pub. It's the only place we're welcome. And you? Do you have whanauhere? I have none here. My husband died. I couldn't pay rent... so they put us out on the street. Hasn't anybody reached out to you to help? Some ladies invited me to some meeting. Well, what meeting is this? Maori Women's Welfare League. Sounds like a waste of time to me. - [INDISTINCT CLAMOR] - MAN: Please. [IN MAORI] Please, ladies, listen up. [IN ENGLISH] Please. Please! [IN MAORI] Listen up! [IN ENGLISH] Please! [CLAMOR CONTINUES] [IN MAORI] Whina. MAN: [IN ENGLISH] There is serious overcrowding and risk of infectious disease spread. - WOMAN 1: There's no jobs. - [CROWD CLAMORS] - WOMAN 1: There's no houses. - [CROWD CLAMORS] WOMAN 1: Our people are arriving in the city, and there's nothing for them to do. They can't feed their families. MAN: I've got a word... WOMAN 2: Our people have taken to the drink. They don't even know what's important anymore. WOMAN 1: Can you blame them? People drink when they are feeling hopeless, and their situation is hopeless. - Get organized. - [INDISTINCT CLAMOR] - Get organized! WOMAN 3: What did she say? Uh... Well, if you wanna stay here arguing in this hall, then keep going. But if you want to do something about it, - you must get organized. - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Strength comes from numbers... from being united. [♪♪♪] If we can get enough of us together, we have a real chance of solving our problems instead of sitting here, fighting amongst ourselves. [CROWD MURMURS] Well, you say there aren't enough jobs. - WOMAN 3: Look around. - There aren't any houses. Nobody cares. Not the church... not the government. - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - That's the problem. The only thing that will make them care is numbers. Real numbers. Statistics... that we get from getting out there and surveying Maori. You know, the government, it doesn't listen to angry voices. The government listens to paperwork. Huh? So, we give them so much damn paperwork, they'll do anything they can to get rid of us. [CHEERING, APPLAUSE] And most importantly... we must look at ourselves. We must educate our women... teach them how to cook... how to sew... how to run a home... sanitation, nutrition, gardening, looking after our babies. We must... take care of our children... [SIGHS] ...take care of what they hear... take care of how they feel. For how the children grow... so will be the shape... of Aotearoa. [CROWD MURMURS] Well, that's all I have to say. - [APPLAUSE] - You were wonderful. [CHEERING] [CHEERING] [IN MAORI] Let's get to work. [IN ENGLISH] Let's get to work. - [WIND BLOWING] - [♪♪♪] NEWS REPORTER: Good morning from Radio New Zealand. The headlines. The Maori Land March led by Whina Cooper continues to make its way down the country from the Far North. Starting with only 50 people, the march has continued to gain numbers and momentum as it travels the 675 miles to Parliament in Wellington. Crowds are reported to be gathering on the roadside to support the movement. [MARCHERS CHANT IN MAORI] [CHANTING CONTINUES IN DISTANCE] [CHEERING, APPLAUSE] [MARCHERS CLAMORING] [CHANTING IN MAORI] [CHANTING CONTINUES] - Are you doing okay, grandchild? - Yes. - I'm all right. - WHINA: Ah! Come on. [IN MAORI] That's good, my granddaughter. - [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - [♪♪♪] [IN MAORI] Hello. [IN ENGLISH] We're from the Maori Women's - Welfare League. - [CHILDREN CHATTERING] [DOOR CREAKS] - WHINA: [IN MAORI] Hello. - Hello. [IN ENGLISH] So, how many of you live here - in your home? - Just four of us. - WHINA: Four of you. - Yeah. WHINA: So, you have three children? Three children. So, you all sleep in the same room? - [IN MAORI] Yes. - WHINA: Mm. [DOGS BARKING] [IN ENGLISH] And how are you earning a living to support your family? Uh, we've been down here a few months... - Odd jobs here and there. - WHINA: Mm-hm. Anything I could find, but it's hard to find work. WHINA: Do you have running water in your home? - Yeah.

[BABY CRYING IN DISTANCE] [♪♪♪] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Whina Cooper. I see you were elected president of the Maori Women's Welfare League. Sometimes positions of power weigh heavily on the holder, do they not? Part of my job, Father, is to ascertain the needs of my people. And this includes their spiritual well-being. Maori are not welcome in your churches, that is very clear. As a result, they're not attending... and you are losing some of your most devout members. There's many problems that we are facing, but I don't wish for this to be one of them. Very well. You consider it done. [BREATHES DEEPLY] Whina. Look, there are things in my life that I regret... and some more than others. My days are spent converting people and forgiving them for the most heinous sins. But who will forgive mine? Who will forgive me, Whina? That is between yourself and God. Thank you for your time. [♪♪♪] [INHALES DEEPLY] Now, did you remember to organize the housing application for the Haweas? - Yes. Whina... - And what about the food parcels for the Onehunga preschool group? Whina, listen to me. You need to think about what we're walking into. The fact that you've only been to three meetings in the last five years has not been well received. [CHUCKLES] A committee has not helped me make decisions in the past. I'm not about to start now. [IN MAORI] [IN ENGLISH] That's all I have time to think about. Whina. So glad you made it today. WHINA: Yes, yes, thank you, Frances. - Now... - [DOOR CLOSING] ...shall we begin with a review of the year's activities? FRANCES: There is a more... important matter to discuss. In the time you've been president, your persistence and energy have been a major asset to the League. In recent years... it seems things have slipped. You don't attend meetings. You make decisions with no consultation. Your way of doing things is what was needed in the past, Whina... [BREATHES SHAKILY] FRANCES: ...but it's not the past anymore. We are looking to the future. A future where your way of doing things... no longer works. [EXHALES DEEPLY] FRANCES: Now, are you all in agreement with this? COMMITTEE MEMBERS: [IN MAORI] Yes. [IN ENGLISH] Well... thank you all for your time. - [BREATHES SHAKILY] - [♪♪♪] [NEWS STING PLAYING ON RADIO] JOE COTE: Good morning from Radio New Zealand.
