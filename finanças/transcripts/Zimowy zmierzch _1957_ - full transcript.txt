WALDEMAR RUMSZA Died as a partisan KONSTANTY RUMSZA Died as a partisan Celinka! Josef! He came back. But not alone. So how is it going to be now? Ask him, don't be stupid. Rumsza! Yeah? Let's go, Celinka! You... Bolshevik. - Let me sleigh. - Go home, Karenta. Guys! Take him home. Good evening. Let me shine the light. The clock broke down this morning. I forgot about bread. We're expecting a baby. Sophie, get dressed! Where will they go at this time? We'll find some place. He won't see us anymore. He can live here alone. Come. Michael! Come. - Watch out, don't drop it. - Take the God. Gentry. Kings. Bishops. And women so pretty. At the end everybody dances with death. Have a look, they drew everyone. But the railwaymen. What evil have we done? Can you hear it? It's for the Polish King who died in war against Turks. Will the bells ring for us one day? "Angels are playing, kings are bowing. Shepherds are singing And animals kneeling. They all announce the miracle". Felek, show us how much they gave you? Come on, guys! What do you want? You won't give us the dough, you swines! What's up with you? Yes? It's not your district. Get off! Josef! Join us! Stop, citizen. Let's drink something. Astranger! Come to Kazio! "Million hands, thousand hands, But one heart is beating!" TAILOR BREAD! Bolshevik! Why are you coming back so late? My God what happened to you? Where did you leave your cap? I'm sure you caught a cold. Krywka prepared the bath. It'll be good for you. He stayed in this town. Con man. He even got a job. You spoil your life... and he'll spoil his. This must be your fate. Michael! Wake up. Michael! Somebody help me! People! Have some tea with raspberries. Maybe I'll call for a doctor? TAILOR Quiet! Bolshevik. Get out of this house! We always have had problems with you. Maybe I'll go for Josef? You see, he's not coming. Although he knows you are dying. I'll go for him. Stay here. Celinka... Just listen to me. Mother this music will only upset you. Lola, darling, I have a guest. I haven't seen you, Celinka. Good evening. I'm sorry, mum. - I'm hungry, mum. - Wait a while. Mum... Still the ballet? Or did she start talking about great love? Ms Natasha tells such nice stories. But we can't live with ballet and great love only, Ms Natasha and Ms Celinka. I still have earrings and a fan from this costume. I'll show it to you, Celinka. Celinka. Do you recognize me? God! Neither you, nor Lola saw the opera in Saint Petersburg. The stage was lit with many candles. Celinka! How one can dance to Gounod's music! How I danced! Tchaikovsky... Delibes... Go on, Celinka... There's nothing to look at. Real, great love! If I only knew... that real love comes only once in a life time... What is left when it's gone... I really must go now. Where do you go like that... alone? What do you want? I have already told you! Celinka! Celinka. Praise be to God. So what will you tell me? 30 years we've been leaving close to each other and finally we can meet. It's time to examine the conscience. Review your life. Where are you going? Everyone has his Judgement Day. No one is eternal. Can you hear me, Rumsza? Long road before you. I have to live. Is it a joke? Did you invite me to party? Snow has to be removed! In this area too! What's going on? Work! Why are you standing? Start working. SOAP What are you doing here? Don't spoil anything and get out of here! I'd like to... I'd like to see an album. I want this one with leaves. With leaves? 15,20 zloty. Eat. You shouldn't go out. - Good morning, Mr Lernartowicz. - One ticket to Budbindy, 3 class. I'll find it in a moment. I can't see it here. Where are you going, Mr Lernartowicz? Budbindy? 700km. You probably go to see you fianc?. 129,60 zloty. You're already leaving? You're not normal yet. Normal ticket, normal. I know, I heard. Normal ticket. Turn the radio on when he starts brawling. Father, father... Dance! - Shall we dance? - Thank you, I don't dance. No? Unthinkable before the war. Beer. Leave this town. There's no place for you here. Where could I go? West. Or come back to the army. - Get lost! - And if I don't? - Let's go home! - No, I don't have a home! Thank you for everything. Orchestra, start playing! A bottle of vodka. Sophie. Sophie. You're not going to work? You'll be late. Guess, Josef, guess. Krywka. Mr Krywka. Listen. Baby was born at Jozek's house. They called for a doctor. Father... Haven't you left your gloves at home? What am I supposed to do now? How should I live? How? I don't have runny nose any more! You're leaving? Bye. Good day. - Don't you have normal pen nibs? - We wanted normal nibs. Pen nibs. Is it good? Good bye. You have to leave this town... Celinka. It will be better for you. Your father will show you. Be quiet, sweetheart. The old man is still sleeping. Celinka, can you do it faster? - Your father will beat you. - But father let us do it! Celinka! Damn widower's life! You're a single man! With grey moustache? Where have you been? - Is your husband still sleeping? - Yes, he is. For God's sake, why are you always taking so long. When you leave, it's for good. - Dad, let me go out. - Sit here! Everybody leaves and I have to do everything. I can't believe it. - Wacek, have you done your homework? - I had nothing to do. - Celinka? Where are you going? - Dad, I want to go out. Rise the dead, we'll attack the alive. Die, disappear! Get out of the house, you morons! I can't count on you! - Wacek! - Just a moment! Celinka! Eat. I won't go anywhere! Never. "You are so beautiful!", said prince Backendorf and kissed my hand... Mum. It's for the dolls. Sweet Jesus! You won't believe it! The road was so bad! I though I'd never make it. You'll never believe. - Please, let's talk about Lola. - You won't believe it. 20 km. My God. It's so pretty! - Please. - God! Today is my birthday. Since this morning I feel like crying. Lola. Get out! Kazik. Kazik! Not like this! Celinka! Imbecile. Wacek! The chest of drawers. You're useless. You want to take your boot off, they tip over a chest. Quiet, you morons. Good morning. We finally found you! Lola. You're so bad. You never button up. Gosh! You boy, come here! Take him! Gosh! How? You're walking on me! Swine! A real swine is behind the curtain. And now the capital's favourite singer: Larysa Sovorova. Ladies and gentlemen, now the master of boxing. Real strongman is looking for an opponent in this town. Maybe someone from the audience would like to prove his masculinity? * Go ahead. Please come. Any volunteers? Yes! Show youself to the opponent! Please, come to the stage! Good day, Mister! - I heard they box here. - Yes, it's true. Really? I want 2 kg of box. - What are you doing? - You told me to put it on. But not on your feet! On your hands! On my hands? My pretty baby. Where is Josef? Watch him. Oh you... Keep it. My sweet baby... So cold! We barely could sit through it. No yet, Celinka. Celinka? I could dance... People applauded... - Let me shine a light. - It's not necessary. Go away. They're not home. Wait for dinner. I've only come back. Don't tell anything to my mum. She would die. Celinka, don't leave. Listen to your dad. Do... Do your homework. I will visit you, Celinka. Listen, Malinowski. She is in the first car. Alone. I saw her. OK. We'll take care of her. This runny nose is killing me, Mr Rumsza. Where is she? Celinka! Celinka! Stay! Text: Magdalena Olech Barrau Napisy: Piotr Zielinski
