(CHILDREN CHATTERING) (CHILDREN AUDIBLE OUTSIDE) (CHATTERING) (CHATTERING CONTINUES) My shoes. (BELL JANGLING) NARRATOR: Generations of Scottish country children have been taught together in just this kind of school. One room, one teacher, no distinction drawn between the laird's child and the shepherd's, ages ranging from five to eleven years. But now, such schools are being closed everywhere. Before long, there won't be any left. Good morning, children. CHILDREN: Good morning, Mrs. Hardie. - "Our Father..." - CHILDREN: "Our Father, "Which art in Heaven, "Hallowed be thy name, "Thy kingdom come, "Thy will be done "On Earth as it is in Heaven. "Give us this day..." (PLAYING "THE LORD'S MY SHEPHERD") CHILDREN: ♪ The Lord's my shepherd ♪ I'll not want ♪ He makes me down to lie ♪ In pastures green ♪ He leadeth me ♪ The quiet waters by ♪ "You... can... see... Mother... "with... Dick... and... Dora. "Dick... sits... by... Myther. "Mother. "Dora... sits... with... Dick." - "The..." - "The... cat... sits... by... the... tree. "The... mud... "by... the... tree... is... wet." - MRS HARDIE: That's very good, Jean. - FRANCES: "'The holidays are here! "'The holidays are here!' "cried Dick as he came running home from school. "'We shall soon be off to the seaside.' "'Yes, ' said Mother. 'We must get her cases ready.' "'We shall help, ' said Dick and Dora. "'We shall get the cases ready.“ MRS HARDIE: In general, everybody is working on the same subject at the same time. When they finish, they're free to look at a book, draw, or play with a piece of equipment. I think... yes. "Zan felt very important. "She knew everyone on Planet Z37 "would be looking at her picture on their TV screen, "and listening to every word she said." MRS HARDIE: But she drunk the... And also, it took all the rain. The rain, from the little tree, and then the little tree couldn't get it. That's right, have we finished with this? Now, will you take your workbooks out? - (CHILDREN CHATTERING) - (CHAIRS SCRAPING) MRS HARDIE: Horses. Can horses wash? - No. - Can they run? - Yes. - Yes? Can they sing? - No. - You're quite sure? - Can... Can they jump? - Yes. Well, "a kitten can play, skip, sing, or fly." - A kitten can play? - Play. - Can it skip? - No. - Can it sing? - No. -Can it fly? You're quite sure? Well, I think if you answer all these just now and then come back. Is Valerie stuck? Now, where are we? "A monkey can..." Now, you've to choose here. "Swing, jump, sing, dance, fly, draw, run, swim." - Look, now, I think you can... - I can. You know? Yes, well, we'll see if Valerie knows. Will you try it yourself, Valerie? Right, what is it? Pardon? What are you out for, Colin? Um... Oh, here. Is this...? Oh, it's on the other side. Here. - Oh. - I have to turn it over. That'll sound good. That's not a word. "Grog" isn't a word. Every three weeks, the mobile library comes. (INAUDIBLE) MRS HARDIE: Yes. Yes, that's lovely. Yes. Write in what they are. Centimetres and decimetres. Is yours... It'll have to go over to the other side. Let me see it, Kenneth. I think you should rub that out and put your ruler across and get the straight lines, will you? Because it's just... now it's all higgledy-piggledy. Have you counted it, Linda? That'll be much better, Kenneth. If you put the figures in, it'll look very much neater. Is three nines thirty-five? - Five? - Three nines, thirty-five? Four. It's four times. That's what's confusing, is you're saying "three" and it's four times. No, four nines are not thirty-five. You'll have to count it again. Two, four, eight... GIRL: One, two, three, four, five, six... MRS HARDIE: "Decimetre." Just rub that all out. Hey, Morag, will you keep quiet? Because you're disturbing everyone else. Would you put in "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven" in your very, very best writing? That's very, very nice. Four sixes are not sixteen. - What's the answer? - Twenty-four. That's right, twenty-four. Oh, something wrong here, Morag. Three eights are certainly not twenty-nine. Three eights. You'll have to count it again. You've got nine on. Please, Miss... That's quite good, Mary. Now, will you put... Will you put "decimetre" at every... at every... at every ten? - Cut off the end here? - Yes, cut off the end. And then you can write "one metre" right along, and colour it. Fifty-six. That's very good, Robert. That's very good. Now, just start another line, will you? That's very nice. Come on, Morag. Well, that's the worst of having a rubber at the end of your pencil, isn't it? That's the very heaviest, is it? Well... Let's see what... Is that it? I think that's set all right, Frankie, do you think? Would you have put on more or take off one? Put on? Right, so we just leave it at that? Right... April the 20th. Well, what day will be the eighth of May? Did you have a calendar for that, Jimmy? - No. - Or did you... How did you work it out? You haven't done it? Oh, you haven't come to it. Measure and find the angle - Oh, the, er... Friday. - You think so? Oh, I don't think you should do that, Doreen. It's too heavy. It's not sitting square on the balance. Right. Frances, a pity you've folded that up. You see, you're doing that again. Please, Miss... MRS HARDIE: Yes, well, would you colour it up, Mary? Make it look very nice. (INAUDIBLE) MRS HARDIE: Right, now, the first thing we 're going to write down is the distance from the school to the church. Now, Frankie measured it with the trundle wheel, and we found it was 2,050 metres. Would you write that down? "From school to church." "From school to church." "Jimmy's distance "from church." "Jimmy's distance from church." (INAUDIBLE) And now, we've got the distance that Jimmy is from the church, the height of Jimmy kneeling, and the angle made with the theodolite. So the height of the church is? - Fourteen-and-a-half metres. - Fourteen-and-a-half metres. (DISTANT CATTLE LOWING) (CHILDREN CHATTERING) (INAUDIBLE) MRS HARDIE: Right, Jimmy, go. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon, Miss Jackson. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon, Miss Jackson. (CHILDREN CHATTERING) (INAUDIBLE) MRS HARDIE: Register of attendance. Form 165, sent to the Local Government Officer on the last Friday before the third Wednesday... Form AB3. "I certify that no member of the teaching staff of this school "has been absent during the month ending..." Daily milk form. Weekly milk form. Meal forms in triplicate. Cheque to county treasurer.

(CHILDREN CHATTERING) Now, if that is the school, will someone show me what is north? North. North? Linda. Right, now south? Angela. Right. Er... East? East? Jimmy? Little Jimmy? West? Could you do it, Morag? Right, come on. NARRATOR: The children's own background is the starting point for many lessons. MRS HARDIE: Why do they dose them, Frances? Margaret? MARGARET: It's to keep the worms... You think it's to keep worms out of the sheep? - GIRL: Why? - MRS HARDIE: Well, some people say that it's for... that they dose them first for liver fluke. Do you know, Morag? Is that what your father says he does it for? What happened after they were dosed, Morag? Opened the gates at the other end, and the sheep ran out into... onto the hill. The gates were open to let them onto the hill. MRS. HARDIE: So, they run onto the hill. But have they been dipped? MORAG: No. They brought them down into... one big... One little pen. When it was empty, they went to get more sheep because they were in one big pen, and they got the... other sheep into the little pen, and they kept on splashing into the dipper. MRS HARDIE: They kept on splashing, and, from this little pen, into the dipper. Did they make a lot of baaing and bleating, did they, when they were being put into the dipper? MORAG: No. MRS HARDIE: When your sheep were being dipped, Frances, did they bleat and baa? FRANCES: Not when they go in the dipper. MRS HARDIE: They don't when they go in the dipper? Now, that's rather strange, isn't it? I would have thought that they would have made quite a sound. I mean, if you were dropped into the dipper, Frances, you would make a great shriek, wouldn't you? So, it's very surprising that the sheep are quiet. "Bruce something an old hat." You'll have to read this again to find what... Oh, I see it. I see it. On you go. You... You read it... read the... the part over again, you'll find it. CHILD: Morag! (CHILDREN CHATTERING) "My pony's name is Kestrel. "I like to groom her every day that she is inside. "I have won a first prize for jumping "at the pony club. " "My pony's name is Story. "He is a very fine pony. "We ride in Liddesdale. "We go with the huntsman "and follow the hounds." MRS HARDIE: Pardon? Yes, yes. Just leave it just now, Angela. We're going to read over the compositions that have been written. "Hermitage Castle is on the moors of Liddesdale. "There are three castles, one within the other. "They have all been built at different periods in history. "Before you go into the castle, there is a gate. "It's called the Kissing Gate. "Mary, Queen of Scots often came to Hermitage Castle, "to visit a man named Bothwell. " That's not correct, is it? She didn't "often come", did she? Mary, Queen of Scots only came once.
