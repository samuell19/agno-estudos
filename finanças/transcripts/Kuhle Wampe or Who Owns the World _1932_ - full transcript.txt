The welfare agency is going to pay Schulz's back rent They won't give us any help You can never tell. The welfare people do what they want to. There is always work for a really good worker But when a person doesn't even bother trying to find work, there's no need wondering why things have gotten so bad. And this boy doesn't even bother to greet our landlord Greeting him doesn't help much when you're six months behind on rent. He could still greet him! A person can't afford to be unemployed and rude both. So you can't find work anywhere? Of course not! Not by being rude! Or by being polite, either. There are no jobs! The boy may be poor and he may be unlucky. But no one could possibly be that unlucky for seven months running now! Are you trying to say that he's just good-for-nothing? Yes, that's what I'm trying to say! And you? How are you getting on? I suppose you've got a time card right there in plain sight in your pocket? You're out of work, too! Just because you spend your whole day out stamping your time card doesn't mean you can come home here and act snooty!Hard-working people get on For god's sake!, quiet down! What will the neighbors think! Every day, the same squabble. I'm coming! Don't blame the morn that brings toil and labor It's nice to care for people that one loves What's going on here? Jumped out of the window. And before he jumped, he took his wristwatch off and laid it on the table. Naturally. The fall would have broken it. Which window is it then? That one there! No, not that one. That one there! One unemployed worker less. Such a young man. And his father doesn't know yet. In America they already have 7 million people out of work. Well. They used to drive to work in cars. Now they're demonstrating against unemployment. But on foot! What was the motive? Unknown! Such a young man. He had the best years of his life ahead of him THE BEST YEARS OF A YOUNG MAN'S LIFE In the matter of the building owner Gustav Stephan, plaintiff, against, one, Franz Bonike, (two) his wife Greta, born Mohr, accused, due to non-payment of rent, the court has decided accused are sentenced to abandon apartment to the plaintiff. Although the accused has been unemployed a long period, the Bonike couple could have paid the overdue rent with a bit of good will. Their current difficulties must be seen as their own fault.

The furniture is out on the street. Yes, and now what? Yes, and now what? Then you'll just have to come out to my place at Kuhle Wampe. Is that possible? Naturally. I'll bring a car for the furniture. About one hour by bus from metropolitan Berlinset among the grass and woods on the inviting shores of the Muggel Lake, not far from the Muggel hills, is the tent colony Kuhle Wampe, Germany's oldest weekend colony. It was established in 1913 with ten or twenty tents. After the War it expanded to such an extent that it now comprises 93 tents in which 300 persons are housed. The pedantic cleanliness within the colony and in its surroundings is remarkable. The colony 'Kuhle Wampe Club Supporters' is a member of the Central Organization of Beach Clubs, Inc. The Club's relationship with the authorities is currently a good one. Kuhle Wampe Club Supporters You just heard the "Schwarzenberg March" written in 1814, in our program of "Army Marches Old and New" Now you will hear the march "Deutsche Kaiserklange" Here rests our last hope for work: "Kuhle Wampe" Attention, Berlin! You just heard the march "Deutsche Kaiserklange" That completes today's morning program from the Berlin Broadcast Hour. The play of the sexes renews itself Each spring. That's when the lovers Come together. The gently caressing hand Of her lover brings a tingle to the girl's breast. Her fleeting glance seduces him. The countryside in spring Appears to the lovers in a new light. The air is already warm. The days are getting long and the fields Stay light a long time. Boundless is the growth of trees and grasses In spring. Incessantly fruitful Is the forest, are the meadows, the fields. And the earth gives birth to the new Heedless of caution. I am a courtesan but not a spy, a courtesan who was paid well for her love, who demanded and got five thousand, even thirty thousand as the just price for her favors. That was the refrain of Mata Hari's defense Among her favorites were... [bread 45, potatoes 15, margarine 30, cheese 15, liverwurst 20...] ... also, as it was put, the one-time ... ... police president of Berlin, Jagow ... the Prince of Braunschweig Mr von Jagow got to know Mata Hari when she performed at the Winter Garden. He visited her backstage to see how the nude dance . Mata Hari and whether everything was legal. She was called the Queen of Dance [1/2 lb. excellent veal fat home-style 45] but known as the Queen of Sensual Pleasures [Special sale! Best German herring, 12 pieces 50 pfennigs, about 2 lbs.] The rich connoisseurs admired her as a delicacy of the rarest kind The effect of her dances came especially from the veils and nudity, from the snake-like and lustful movements, in short,the symbolism of love orgies, as seen indeed in the expressive dances of the most primitive and oriental peoples [onions 15/lb.] Only her small breasts were covered by small, chiseled copper plaques. The upper arms and ankles were decorated with bracelets set with gleaming jewels. Otherwise she was naked, from her fingertips to her toes ... The dance revealed her flexible and firm structure in its an- androgynous agility. Between the arching lines reaching from her open under arm below her raised hands to the depression at her waist The legs were an ideal shape and were raised like two fine columns of a pagoda. The knee caps were like two round lily buds. Everything had a delicate am-amber color. Everywhere gold and pink lights played. Born on the column's capital of long, softly arched thighs the ivory-colored stomach... Hello! Were you there? It's too dirty there. I'm not going to ruin my life. ... I'll beat you to a pulp. If anything happens ... High voltage! Danger! Life-threatening! Don't lie, something is the matter with you. Don't make trouble here at work, otherwise I'll be fired tomorrow I can't stand it any more.

Just whistle and I'll run! Just whistle! Whistle! What are you up to? Get Mother and your things! We're moving away from here. Gerda put a bee in your bonnet? Where can we go? We're not just gypsies on the road in the middle of the night. You've gone nuts! You've got to be really ashamed. She's gone nuts. Simply ran away. Don't worry, Fritz, we'll stay with you. What a joke. So, now you're going to live with me, next Sunday you'll come with me to the athletic games and you can forget Fritz.

She's not running around. She's with us and works here. She was here before, too, before you came along and took her from us. I convinced her that she didn't have the stuff for your athletics. In my view some women don't have what it takes. Some do and some don't. I think she feels fine here with us. I can't come tomorrow. I'm out of money. I have only twenty pfennigs too. Can't you give us something? Sure. By the way, I was laid off yesterday. That's bad. Look at that! And if you want to talk to Anni, come on out with us tomorrow.

"Birth Control" I have that one already "Factory and Union" Listen, I'll read it again now: 'A real state,' says Hegel, 'and a real state government emerge only when there are already distinct classes when wealth and poverty increase greatly and when the situation is such that a large number can no longer satisfy in the accustomed way.' Now hold still! Fritz always wanted to have his freedom. At 13 Marks 20 a week, freedom is worth shit Well, then he can marry Anni I'm sure he'll do it At least she is earning money You may be right Attention! Doors closing! In Brazil, they burned 24 million pounds of coffee. What did they do with the coffee? They burned it, pure and simple 24 million pounds of coffee burned? That is no more than demagogy. I read that too but I don't believe it. Anyone with common sense knows that is simply not possible 'Burned coffee - Madness of the World Market.' See? There you have it: 'In Santos, the world's largest coffee port, there is more coffee in the warehouses than the world ... um... can buy... All together 12 to 15 million sacks... more than an entire year's production from Brazil, so... And because more and more coffee is added... the government has the surplus burned. You don't have to read that. We know about that nonsense We have expensive wheat and unemployed industrial workers while Argentina has expensive industrial goods and unemployed farmers. And it is all called the world market and is a crying shame. 24 million pounds of coffee burned. That is really a crying shame! They can do that to us! Quite right! I don't understand a thing! Burned coffee! What's the purpose anyway? That is pure malice on the part of those people. Malice? They can't be malicious if they don't ... So you want to defend the guys, huh? You think it's okay that they burn the expensive coffee? Permit me, the man didn't say that at all. The man said quite clearly... What is it you said again, neighbor? You know, you should never actually boil coffee, I tell you. Coffee should never boil. Once it boils, it is ruined. And don't even think of pouring the coffee into a tin pot because the aroma just disappears It's all in here. Why did they do it? Because they wanted to keep the price of coffee high. You see! 'You see!' We have to pay the high price! And why do we pay the high price? Because our hands are tied International politics! Quite right! If we had a fleet, then we'd have colonies too. If we had colonies then we'd have coffee too. And if we had coffee... Yeah, what then, in your esteemed opinion? Go ahead and say it. Then prices will go down, huh? No, they shouldn't. But then... ... we'll cut the deal! I keep hearing 'we'. Who is that: we? You and me? And that gentleman there? And the lady there? And the funny man there? So, 'we' cut a deal Come on, man, you don't really believe that! 24 million pounds. 36 times 24... carry the zero ... another zero. Then they threw away 86 million? That's supposed to be a deal? That's no deal! If one pound costs 3 Marks 60... What, 3.60? Hey, you must be used to a superior brand. Gentlemen, I say it again: so long as the people can't save their pennies, they'll never get a head. Quite true! Yeah, you really look like you save your pennies Okay: one pound costs 3 Marks 60... But why 3.60? For 2.40 you can get very good coffee. I even bought some for 2 Marks Really? Let's say 3 Marks. That's not the point. Now wait a minute! I say 2.50 and he says 3 Marks and there's supposed to be no difference? 24 million times 300.. That's nonsense, what he's figuring there. They earn nothing on the stuff they throw away but rather on the stuff they keep and sell to us at a high price. You've always got to have less than is needed. Otherwise there's no deal! You can only make a deal when there are people who need something and don't get it They're on welfare but they drink coffee by the pound; you can smell it in the stairwell. I don't know nothing, but I always said to my husband: 'William, you know, there's something fishy there.' Coffee is a luxury in any case. The common people never drank coffee before Before the people used to travel in carriages. Political agitation is forbidden! What do you mean 'agitation'? You're the one who's campaigning! Just keep your temper, young man! I'm not your young man! It's quite obvious that you never served. And you? You were probably an noncomissioned officer, huh Kurt, belt him one! Give the fool an orange and send him to the orphanage! You! Close your trap or sawdust will come out! I warn you! Your insult costs 40 Marks Oh man, don't ruffle feathers Since when do you talk to me like that? They didn't raise us in the same stall! Quite right! Bow-legged and can't hold a gun! Stupid fathead! Other people've got a head but you've got a pimple! But gentlemen, I must insist that you quiet down! You are not alone in the train! You keep talking about coffee in Brazil. Now I ask you, gentlemen: what is it to you what happens to the coffee in Brazil? Quite right! What's more it's Sunday today Okay, if you're not interested in coffee, then I have another question for you: you do eat bread, right, neighbor? What do you say to the wheat they're using in America to fuel the boilers? And what about the cotton? Ya see, we don't even need that much coffee. We Germans are thrifty people The main thing is stay free of those foreigners. You know, we should be growing our own coffee in Germany. They grow so many grapes along the Rhine, why not some coffee? You see? We could even buy wine in France. And then we'd have peace in Europe, you see? Yea, the two of us, we're not going to change the world either! Right... ...You won't change the world. And the lady there... ... will not change it either. And the man will not either... ...and an unpolitical person like you... ...not by a long shot... And this man here ... he too will not change the world. He is satisfied the way it is now And who will change it? Those who are not satisfied!
