I'll see you outside in 10. (birds chirping) (birds chirping) (birds chirping) - You went all out. - [Dad] It's not every day your baby girl turns 18. - You wasted your time. - [Dad] Here. - Dad, I'm not doing this anymore. - [Dad] What's this? You gonna gimme an isosceles stance? Where's your shooting foot? Where's your support foot? - Dad, I said I'm not doing this anymore. - [Dad] What, you suddenly got cold feet? - [Jasmine] It's not about that. - [Dad] You think 'cause you all grown up now, you know how to take care of yourself. - I don't have to do anything anymore. - [Dad] We always got shit we gotta do. Jasmine. - This isn't about responsibility. - [Dad] Then what? Help me understand baby girl. 'Cause you seem to, all of a sudden, think you got an understanding of how this world works when you don't. So if it's not about taking care of yourself. - It's about me not wanting to be you, Dad. The world is changing. I have the opportunity to fight in my own way. - [Dad] Most of us don't get to be James Baldwin baby girl. Most of us gotta be us. You have a dream, you end up dead on the sidewalk. The world don't change it just keeps spinning. - Well, if that's true then this is all pointless anyway. - [Dad] Survival is not pointless, Jasmine. Now take the shot. - No. - [Dad] While you're under my roof, you're gonna know how to protect yourself. - I'm 18 now. - [Dad] Yo, still under my roof and eating my food. - God, you really wanna go over all this again? - [Dad] Just get it over with and take the shot. - [Jasmine] I'm not doing it. - [Dad] Two seconds and you'll be back in your bed and back to dreamy land. - [Jasmine] No. - [Dad] God damn it girl, take the goddamn shot. - No. - [Dad] Jasmine Zefrina Newton, you better shoot those motherfucker crackers in the goddamn head, or by God, I'll whoop your ass 'til you can't sit straight.

(Angelique screaming) (Shanan laughing) (both laughing) - You fucking bitch. (all laughing) I'm gonna fucking kill you. Let's fucking go. (cellphone vibrating) - [Shanan] Seriously, get the fuck off of me. - [Angelique] No. - Hey Mom. Oh sorry, give me a second. - [Angelique] You are fucking done. - [Shanan] No, no, no, no. - Hey Mom. Thanks, thank you. When? I'm assuming they didn't give a reason this time. No, no, no Mom, I can't. No Mom, I can't go through that again, I just. No, it has nothing to do with that. No Mom, I just. Okay. - Get the fuck off of me. - No, you're gonna fucking die today. - [Shanan] No. (both laughing) - What's wrong? - Yeah, what's going on? - My dad, the cops picked him up again. - Oh my God. Do you want us to drive you there? Like we can go with you. - Yeah, I can get Brendan to take you. - No, no, no, it's just, my dad's a violent guy, so I have no way of knowing if this is just your run of the mill racism or if he actually did something. But either way, they're just gonna want bail for whatever it is, which is more money down the drain for my parents. But last time this happened, I just had to sit around and watch my dad refuse to listen to his lawyer and disrespect the judge and just make things worse for himself. And I can't sit by and watch him do that to himself again. - Is there anything we can do? - Yeah, anything at all, Jasmine? - No, no. But thank you. I'm sorry to just dump all of this on you. - Oh my God, no, don't apologize. - Yes, please don't worry about it. - Yeah but for real, like the best thing you can do for me is to just have fun this weekend and really don't worry about me. Like the best thing for me is to just pretend like it's not going on, so we can all just enjoy ourselves. - Yes, whatever you need. - Okay. (door knocking) - I'll get it. - If at any point this weekend you change your mind and you wanna go home, let us know, we'll take you home. Or at least make sure you have a ride, okay. - Oh, thanks Shanan. But really all I want is for you to have fun this weekend. - Girl, you know I can do that. Angelique, why are you letting strange men into our apartment? - I'm not so strange, if you spend a little time to get to know me. - Well what if I don't wanna get to know you? - Well in Shakespeare, knowing someone is another way of saying you had sex with them. So it'd be your loss. - Ooh. - Ah Jesus woman, have you lost your mind? - [Shanan] Oh yeah. - [Brendan] Oh hey, happy birthday. - Oh wow. Thank you. - Sorry I didn't have time to wrap it or anything. - Yeah, no, please, by all means don't worry about it, save the trees. - [Brendan] Have you read it already? Please say no. - No I haven't, thank you. - It's a book we used to read in the critical race theory class before Mr. Shabinski took over. I think it's a lot better. It's this really beautiful mix of prose and poetry. - Oh my God just shut up and fuck me already. - [Brendan] Jesus Shanan, I'm trying to have a conversation with your friend. - [Shanan] No, no conversations allowed. - Are you packed? - Yes, Sir. - All right, go get your bags then. - Ah, why are you so mean to me? - [Brendan] Anyway, I hope you like it. - Yeah, no, thank you. I'm really looking forward to it, after this weekend. - Oh yeah, no fuck reading for this weekend. This weekend's just gonna be fun, nonstop. - Thank you for sending all this up. I don't really think I've had a getaway weekend before. - I mean, it's not Miami, but it's a big property and it'll just be us and our friends and enough alcohol to intoxicate a herd of elephants. Hey Angelique, do you need help at all? - [Angelique] No, I'm good. Just lemme know when you're ready so I can grab my bag. - [Brendan] You got it. - Also, Shanan seems to really like you, so thanks, I guess, for just being a decent guy. Sophomore and junior year were pretty rough for her, so. - I mean, I really like her too. So thanks for being her friend during those years. - Daddy, it's so heavy. Oh here, let me help you with that. (both screaming) - Jasmine hurry. (laughing) - God. You sure you're okay? - Yeah, I'm doing great, really. - Yo, what up homies, what's good.

But you're gonna count at least a couple dozen Trump signs on the way there. - I say if we count more than 40, we get the fuck out. - [Brendan] Oh, there won't be that many. - Yeah, we could just fucking take 'em and have a fucking cookout, make some s'mores and shit. - I like that idea. - I do not like the idea of trespassing on redneck property. - [Isaac] You could stay in the car, Jasmine. - Yeah, I say we got at least one. - Yeah, for the memories, mami, he gets it. - We could leave the balloon in its place. - Oh shit. But I wanna stick around and see what the reaction is. That shit is gonna be a hilarious. - No, if you stick around, they're gonna get shot. - Yo, no one's gonna shoot me, I look friendly.

They're like totally official. - Really? - Yes, it's official. - Oh that's great. He's a great guy. He's one of my oldest friends. - Yeah you're hooking us all up. - Yeah cool, cool, good to know. So me and Claire, we're like the least official. - [Angelique] Oh my God, don't say that. - [Brendan] Clair really likes you man, she told me. - Hey man, don't go getting my hopes up for no reason, man. - [Brendan] Oh no, I swear. - No, no, no, she's like probably just messing with me. - Hey. - Hey don't say that Isaac. - Nah, I'm just saying. I know better than to get my hopes up too soon. That's all I'm saying. - You're safe enough now to get your hopes up. - Yes Isaac. - Yes Isaac. - Okay, okay. Maybe so, maybe so. I'm just saying that like of all the peoples here, me and Claire are least official. - Well Jasmine's not seeing anyone. - [Isaac] Yeah, right, except for Jasmine. - Isaac, why you got a single her out like that? - It's okay, really it's fine. - [Isaac] Sorry Jasmine, I was literally. - Isaac, you're all good, I promise. - My friend Josh is gonna be there. He's a really great guy. - [Shanan] Brendan. - [Brendan] What? - I told you, she wouldn't go for it if it looked like a setup. - I think we're well past that point already. - [Shanan] Yeah 'cause men have no sense of subtlety. - I just said he's a great guy. What am I supposed to do, just say he's gonna be there and that's it. - Yes, Brendan, yes. That's all you do. - I wasn't at all subtle with you? - Oh yeah, I have things that I like and Jasmine has things that she likes. - I feel like neither of you are great matchmakers, to be honest, so. - Okay, number one, that hurt. But number two, on a scale to one to 10, how badly are you trying to catch a dick this weekend? Just so we know what we're doing. - I appreciate the gesture, but I'm really not looking to catch anything this weekend. And if I feel like either one of you are altering your behavior in any way whatsoever, I'm just gonna tell the poor guys straight up that I don't think he's attractive and I'm not gonna have sex with him just because he and I are the only two single people in the general vicinity. - You know, Claire and I aren't official yet, remember. - [Angelique] You two almost official. - [Shanan] But like what if he is attractive? I know what you like, Jasmine. - I don't care if he's a young Obama with tattoos, I'm not catching a dick this weekend. - Come on Jasmine, maybe you just gotta go with the flow, let things fall as they may. You know what I'm saying? - [Jasmine] You wanna talk to the two matchmakers up front. - I'm just saying, good things usually happen to us when we relax and open. - Jasmine can have. - Oh my God, you've been reading "Confusions" again huh? - [Isaac] Yo. - Jasmine can have all the fun she wants without being open to whatever. - I'm just like, I don't know. Like what if he is like OD attractive and then Claire decides that she wants have sex with him instead of me? - There is literally like zero chance of that happening. - I'm just saying these things happen. What are you talking? - Isaac I love you but I'm not gonna have sex with someone so you can feel more secure. - I wasn't ask you to have sex with him. Geez, I just meant like, I don't know, maybe you flirt a little. - I haven't flirted since high school. - Girl, that's a lie and you know it. - Okay, just because I made out with a guy or two. - Or a girl or two. - Does not mean flirtation preceded the event and fashion. - Yo flirting is mad scary. - [Angelique] Isaac, it might not be so scary if you weren't smoked out of your mind. - Hey, this is what calms the nerves. - It also makes you paranoid as fuck. - Yo, I just stole the Trump sign from a fucking redneck and put a ginormous baby Trump in his place.

It's just that. What are you doing? - Oh huh, oh what is this, vodka, tequila? - All right. - Hey guys. - Hey Josh. - Are you two getting started already? - Boy, we got started four hours ago.

If you keep this up, I'm never gonna have to buy shoes again. - That doesn't sound like a good thing. - I love shoes, but I have four years of college debt I have to pay off. - We've got a three and a half hour car ride's worth of sexual tension to get out of our systems, enjoy the farm until we get back. - To infinity and beyond.

Hey, I'm Josh. - Jasmine. - It's nice to meet you. Angelique and Shanan talk about you a lot. - I'm sorry for however much more time you'll never get back. - It wasn't a waste of time. - Do you mind holding this bottle of alcohol while I go grab my bag? - Sure. Think I can manage that. I can get your bag if you'd rather. - I got it, thanks. (door hinge creaking) - So you'll be right in there.

Yo, let me hold that. - Oh my God Isaac, no. - Oh fuck. (all laughing) Oh my God, fucking hell. Somebody tell the chef don't season to meet with the charcoal.

(all laughing) - Oh fuck you cooked this? - How can you even think that? - No, no, no, no, no, no, she's got herself a chef. - Oh fuck, did Luis make this. - Yeah. - Fuck I know you and Luis are tight and all but please don't tell him I was out here throwing shade on his burgers. I know that's your man. - Don't worry about it. Everyone but Luis knows his cooking sucks. - This shit is worse than sucks. This is the first time I ever rejected food after smoking as much as I smoked today. (all laughing) - [Shanan] Do you even know how much you smoked today. - Let me think. The denominator was the past 24 hours. So you add the two, you carry the six. - And ketchup up as requested. - Oh yes. (gentle upbeat music) - More please. Yeah, you can do more. (gentle upbeat music) - Yo Luis, Luis. See I got like a particular way I like my burgers done. You got any meat left? - Yeah, yeah, in the kitchen, please. - Cool, good to know. See for me, it's not so much about how long you keep the burger on, it's about how much you keep the burger moving. (gentle upbeat music) - Yeah, the best thing to tell Luis is just, I'm not hungry. (all laughing) - [Jasmine] That sounds like really good advice. - Yeah, from his point of view I'm fucking anorexic. - Oh, so you're friends with Luis too? - Yeah, me, Luis, Brendan, Josh, we all go way back. - I think it's great. Lots of little small weddings. - [Jasmine] Jesus, Shanan, weddings. Whoa, you need to slow down. - I'm just saying it would be convenient. - I hate to be a Debbie Downer but it also means a fucking weird set of destroying alliances if one of y'all breaks up. - [Angelique] Jasmine. - I'm just saying, keeping it in the family isn't always a walk in the park. - If we wanted to keep it in the family, we'd go to Alabama. - Ew. - I'm sticking with my girls, no matter what happens and no matter what side Brendan takes. - [Angelique] Yes. - That's all I wanted to hear. - And Claire, if Isaac fucks up, we love him but we've got your back. - Thank you. I'm glad I get to be, I don't know, firmly established wherever I go. - Moral of the story, it's hoes before bros. Hoes and Jasmine before bros. - Thanks babe. (all laughing) - I'm like fucking running back to the car and I'm thinking maybe we shoulda tied up the balloon before grabbing the sign. 'Cause this thing is blowing all over the place and shit. And if this guy looks out of any one of his fucking windows, he's gonna just see this huge fucking thing, just bobbing and weaving. - Yo, I would give him so much money, just see the look on that guy's face. - [Claire] I mean, is there a chance he's gonna like call the cops or something? - [Isaac] Shit, I mean, what's that gonna look like? - Excuse me, Sir, but a bunch of liberals stole my Trump sign and replaced it with a huge fucking balloon of our president as baby. (all laughing) - I honestly wish you hadn't left it. I wanna see this thing. - I got pictures. - Was there a car in the driveway? - Yeah, two cars. - You guys are idiots. - Oh my God. - Hey, no harm, no foul. - [Angelique] Isn't it great? - I just like to point out that none of this would've been possible if I hadn't made the purchase. - Yes, we owe it all to Shanan. - Yeah, y'all could have gotten shot. - [Jasmine] Ah, that's what I said. - Yeah, you gotta fight these motherfuckers one way or another. - I think we need a slightly more extensive, risque evaluation. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I hate to be that guy. But like not every Trump supporter's a gun toting redneck who's gonna shoot you for trespassing. - Uh oh. - I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be an apologist here or whatever. I just think, you know, it's not smart to make a huge generalization like that for 70 million people, you know. It's like you're sort of ignoring the other possible psychological reasons or other issues that go into supporting one political candidate over another. - I mean, we know the other psychological reasons and issues though, right. If you're not not a gun toting racist redneck then you're a fucking capitalist CEO motherfucker, who probably don't live in PA and who stands to make a huge fucking profit off the guy. - No, I know. See, that's part of it too though. It's just like, I don't think you can lump enormous amounts of people into categories like that. You know, like not every single Trump supporter is a racist. (Shanan laughing) - Angelique. - What? Tell me what you think. Seriously, seriously. - It's not about whether or not you personally want to keep your AK-47 or whether or not you personally want to be lynching black folk in your spare time, it's about what you're okay with in terms of how society, as a whole, operates. - Okay, I get that. But like if you just start calling everybody racist and shaming everybody back into their holes, then they're just gonna hide away and come out whenever they can. As opposed to like getting to the core root problem of why people are the way that they are. And like trying to progress society as a whole. I mean, and you're never gonna do that if you just start sweeping people into large vague categories. - Hey, I don't know if we got the luxury of doing that. - Well, I don't think we have the luxury of just ostracizing a third of the population. - Yeah, no, no, I get that. But like this ain't about you. Like, no I'm not trying to say what you're saying isn't logical and it doesn't make sense. - Okay. - But when I see, listen, when I see hundreds of fucking frat boys marching and chanting, "The Jews will not replace us." That scares the fucking shit out of me. - There were consequences though. I mean, people got singled out, shamed, they got fired by companies. - Yeah, but that's like private businesses stepping up, not a government or a society. - When you censor people, you just make them angrier. - [Angelique] You do not make them angrier, if there's clarity as to why this censorship exists. - Yes, exactly. - In Germany, it is illegal to fly the Nazi flag or make a Nazi salute, but it isn't here because America can't own up to its own sins because it has financial interest in propagating those sins further. - Yeah and Germany doesn't have this like huge ass debate as to whether or not it's wrong because they're not trying to rewrite history like we are. - [Luis] Have you ever been to Germany? - They own up to their shit. - Have you ever been to Germany? I mean, I'm not, sorry I'm not trying to challenge you or whatever. I'm just curious. - Nah man, you all good, but hell no. Remember what they did is like a part of their culture now. And I'm not trying to think about my ancestors or the Holocaust every time I pass a memorial on every fucking street corner. Fuck outta here with that shit. - Okay, okay, okay, so maybe that's not a good thing then. All right, like, is America really rewriting history? - [Angelique] Oh fuck yes. - Eh. - [Angelique] If Trump had won a second term, his whole 1776 propaganda education would have been passed. - Which is why for like my own personal mental health, I'm not trying to go to Germany, but I sure as would feel safer in Germany than I do here, word. - All right, I don't get that though. Isn't not feeling safe a toll on your mental health? - I mean, my family's here and I gotta believe that as a whole, society is slowly wanting to improve. Maybe that's a luxury for me to believe that. But I sure as fuck would've moved out the country if he'd won a second term. Believe that shit. - Yeah but like, it's not like you're easily identifiable. You know you're not like acidic so. - Yo, first off, respect the nose. Second, second they found Jews in the '30s and '40s by like rounding up enormous groups of people and checking to see who's circumcised. - Oh my God. - That happens, most of us are fucked. - I know I am. - That's not the point. Listen, white people will always come up with some ridiculous fucking criteria, right. Like if it's not circumcision, it'll be something else. Whenever the next huge wave of fascism comes, and if we're being honest, America's like ripe as fuck for that to come, then it don't really matter the criteria for passing as white or straight or Christian or whatever. I mean, they'll pick whatever fits the little racist brains at the time they're doing that shit. - Yeah exactly. My people got blamed for covid and white people use that as an excuse to attack us any chance they got. - Yeah and if leaders had gone out and started calling it the Jewish flu or whatever, then guess who these racist motherfuckers would've gone out to fucking assault them. - Right, no, that makes sense. But I'm just saying. I don't know, maybe I'm not the one who should be saying. - No, it's okay, spit it out. - But like, I just don't think it's fair to equate whatever bigotry you have to face with racism. Am I right? - No, yeah, I agree. I'm just saying that like historically Jews and in the other race, other than white people, get suppressed as fuck. My case is just like one example of the different possibilities. (fire crackling) (fire crackling) - I mean, I don't think the point is for it to be a competition or some sort of comparative oppression scale. Oppressive systems intersect and they impact different marginalized groups in different ways. Like Angelique and I can't call the cops like ever, that's just the way it is. Which means we never really have any feeling of safety or security ever. - Just last week, my dad's car was scraped by this crazy driver. And of course they tried to blame us, so they called the cops and the other driver just got to scream and yell the whole time. My dad just had to stand there and take it, you know. If the cop wrote something negative about him in his report, or God forbid something worse, which is not an unlikely possibility. - Jasmine's dad was a Black Panther. - Holy shit, really? - Damn, that's badass. - No, it's not. I'm sorry. I mean, I'm not sorry, but it's not, there's nothing, there's nothing badass about trying to survive, there's nothing glorifying about fighting to survive in a society that doesn't want you to. And calling it badass is just a really bad manifestation of performative allyship. - Yes, exactly. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. - I'm not trying to jump down anybody's throat. It's just, I'm, it's difficult to sit here and listen to people debate the same thing over and over again, instead of just listening to experts and listening to people who know what they're talking about and try to understand, it's not about any one of us personally, we have to categorize and generalize, and we have to expand our understanding of racism and what qualifies as racist because we are vastly outnumbered. And outgunned. (fire crackling) (fire crackling) - I think we're all learning still about what's best in terms of society progressing and yeah, you really can't trust anyone. Who knows, maybe it'd be helpful if just white dudes legally have to introduce themselves as not a Nazi. (all laughing) - Yo, I'd be down for that shit. - Hi, my name is Brendan, I have an appointment with Dr. So-and-so. Oh and I'm not a Nazi. - Hey, I'm Josh, I've been single for three years and I'm not a Nazi. - Well, I'm not against this policy. - Hey, yo, what's up? My name is Brendan and I'll be a waiter today. And I'm not a Nazi. (all laughing) - Yo what up, my name is Josh. I'm here to watch your kids, but like, don't even worry about it, I'm like, no Nazi. (all laughing) - [Angelique] Hey, this should at least be mandatory for cops. - Hello. Yes, what is your emergency? Oh, by the way, I am not a Nazi. - Sir, open up, we have a warrant for your arrest. Oh and I'm not a Nazi. - [Luis] Sir, do you know how fast you are going? Oh, by the way, I'm not a Nazi. (all laughing) (insects chirping) - [Josh] Hey. - Hey. - Sorry, am I interrupting? - No, you're good. - Thanks. Want a beer? - I'm good, thanks. - Sure. (insects chirping) What you reading? - "A map to the door of no return." Brendan gave it to me this morning. - Oh cool, so Brendan's just giving away books? - No, it's my birthday today. - What? - So. - Holy shit, happy birthday. - Thanks. - Why didn't you tell anyone? - I mean, I don't know how to do that. Like what do you do? What, just, hey, nice to see you all, by the way it's my birthday. - Fair enough, fair enough. But someone should have told me, we should have bought you a cake or something. - We had a small celebration this morning. - Damn, so it's just party all day for you today, huh? - I wish every birthday could be like that. - And why stop there? Let's just make it every day period. - Cheers to that. - But not like, literally. - Yeah no, not literally. I can't really do beer, makes me feel bloated. - Hey, you want me to grab you something else? - No, I'll go get something. - Are you sure? I'm sorry, I feel like I disrupted your alone time. - Yeah, Angel and Shanan will get mad at me anyway if they find out I was reading so. - Get mad at you? - Yeah, apparently it's not cool to read at parties. - I think it's pretty cool. - Oh, thanks my dude. (all laughing) - What the fuck you guys are talking about. - Hey Jas. - Hey, Angel and Luis turn in already? - Well, it depends on how you define turn in. - They are in bed. - [Shanan] Baby. - [Brendan] Hmm? - [Shanan] I'm cold. - You wanna go in? You guys staying up? - [Isaac] What do you want? - Let's go in. - Josh? Jasmine? - Yeah, I'm ready to turn in. - Yeah, it's late. - All right, I gotta put it out the fire and I'll be right in. - Okay. - [Isaac] Does the TV in the living room have Netflix? - [Claire] No. That thing's from the '90s. - Don't take too quickly because I need to get ready, but don't take too long because I'm impatient. - [Brendan] Okay, got it. (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music) - Hey. - Hey. - You wanna go for a walk? - Like right now? Like with me? Like outside? (both laughing) All right, let's do it. We'll be back. - [Claire] Could be a while. - What, no bong? - I'll turn on light on time. - Oh my God. (all laughing) (gentle music) (gentle music) - I am glad you guys came. Today was a great day. - Yeah, it was fun. (gentle upbeat music) - [Josh] I hope you had a good birthday. - I did. (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) I am gonna head to bed. I'll see you tomorrow. - Yeah okay. Have a good night. - You too. (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) - So I'm looking around it's like 5:00 a.m. I'm like where the fuck am I? (both laughing) - That's freaking hysterical. - And that's why I'm drinking smoke at the same time, unless I got my friends around. That's. (gentle upbeat music) (both laughing) (gentle upbeat music) Hey. - Hey. (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (Isaac laughing) (gentle upbeat music) (Isaac laughing) (gentle upbeat music) - You don't see a lot of these in the city. - [Claire] Yeah, it's way better out here. - Yeah, it's nice. (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) My dad knows a lot about astronomy. - Oh yeah. What's his sign? - Well, he's an Aries, but that's astrology. - Oh. (both laughing) - He knows a lot of stuff about astronomy, like he could look up at the sky right now and just tell you exactly what day it is, just based on the stars. - Wow. - Yeah. - That's amazing. - Yeah, it is. (gentle music) - I was born on a day when Venus and Jupiter were aligned, which only happens like seven times every a hundred years or so. So it's this really rare thing. And my dad, my dad tells a story about how he snuck a telescope into a hospital so he could look up in the sky while he was waiting for my mom to give birth to me. It's called occulting, when one planet crosses in front of another. It has nothing to do with like cults or whatever, but they both come from the same Latin word, which means to hide or to keep secret. Huh. Makes you wonder what else is just. Claire. (door knocking) - Shit. Come in. What's up? - It's a little cold out here. Is it all right if I join you. - Here, I don't. I can sleep out there, I don't mind the cold. - Well the whole point would be to stay warm with someone else's body. (gentle upbeat music) - Look Josh, I don't know if my friends gave you the wrong idea or something, but I'm really not looking to be around someone tonight. So I'm sorry. I mean, I'm not sorry for not being interested, but I'm sorry if you got the wrong impression, at some point. Well, here, I really don't mind sleeping out there so. Josh, let me through. - What's wrong? Why don't you like me? - I'm tired and I'm not interested in having this conversation right now. If you wanna talk about it more tomorrow, we can, but right now, I just want you to let me through. - Well maybe you like it a little rough. - What the fuck is wrong with you? - What's wrong with you? - Touch me again and I'll fucking scream. (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) - Claire. (gentle upbeat music) Claire. (gentle upbeat music) Claire. (gentle upbeat music) Yo, Claire quit playing with me, this ain't funny. Claire. (gentle upbeat music) (gentle upbeat music) - Fuck. (gentle upbeat music) - Come on guys. Who's playing with me? Claire. (guns firing) (dramatic music) (Shanan gasping) (dramatic music) (Shanan gasping) (dramatic music) (Shanan gasping) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (Brendan moaning) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (screaming) (dramatic music) (gasping) (door knocking) (gasping) (dramatic music) - Angel. Shanan. Angel. Shanan. (dramatic music) (door knocking) Angel. Shanan. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Fuck. (dramatic music) (gasping) (dramatic music) - Are you okay, did he hurt you? (dramatic music) - Yes. - Okay. - Yeah, no, I'm fine. Just, I dunno. - It's okay, it's okay, I'm here now. We're gonna get you outta here okay. - Where Shanan? - We're gonna get Shanan. We just have to get you outta here first okay. It's okay, it's okay. (dramatic music) (Isaac screaming) - You fucking son of a bitch. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Is he dead? - He's breathing. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Shanan. Shanan. Shanan, wake up. Shanan. Shanan. Shanan. Shanan. Please, Shanan. Shanan. Shanan wake up. Shanan. Shanan. Come on. Shanan. Shanan. Shanan. - Angel. - Shanan. - Angel. - Shanan. - Angel. - Shanan. - Angel we gotta go. - We can't keep her. - Yeah, we're gonna come back. We're gonna come back for her. - Fucking motherfucking piece of shit. (Isaac screaming) (Isaac moaning) (guns firing) - Isaac. (dramatic music) (car engine revving) (dramatic music) (car engine revving) (dramatic music) Go, go, go. Jesus, Jasmine fucking go. (dramatic music) Oh my God, oh my God. Oh my God, oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. - It's okay, it's okay. It's okay, Angelique, we got away, we're safe. - What about Isaac? What are we going to do? - I don't know. - What happened? What happened? - [Jasmine] I don't know. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I just feel so useless. - Just focus on your breathing okay, just breathe. - Please pull over her. - Angel, we can't. - I feel like I'm gonna throw up, pull over please. (car engine revving) (Angelique coughing) (dramatic music) (Angelique coughing) (dramatic music) (Angelique coughing) (dramatic music) - Angel. (gun firing) Angel. - [Josh] Get outta the car. Keep your hands up. (dramatic music) - Josh, please, please let us go. - Shut up. - Why don't you like me? Huh? (Angelique coughing) Why don't you like me? - I don't know, maybe because you're a psychotic freak who's friends with psychotic freaks. - You didn't know that. You didn't know any of that before. (dramatic music) I did everything right. I was patient. I was kind. - Josh, please let me take my friends to the hospital. - Everybody gets to have sex but me, Brendan, Claire even fucking Luis. And this is Luis' first time. But every time it's the same. (Angelique coughing) Everybody gets to have sex but me. Josh never gets to have sex. Josh never catches a fucking break. (Angelique coughing) They told me you were a sure thing. Brendan said all Shanan's friends were sluts or sex positive or whatever the fuck liberals are calling it these days. But when it comes to me, when it comes to Josh, oh no, Josh still can't get some. - Ah. Please, please don't shoot me. Wait, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, please don't kill me. (gun firing) (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music) - [Dad] Aha that's my girl. God damn that's my baby girl aha. Miss. Jasmine Newton. Ain't no one gonna mess with you now. You may be small, but the moment some wise ass cracker see what you can do, hell, they'll be running for the hills. Their sorry asses will be wishing they never seen your black face. They'll never wanna see no niggas again after that. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please, please don't kill me. Brendan makes us do it. If we don't do what he says, he'll kill us. I've seen him do it. Please, you don't know what it's like. Please don't kill me. - Angel. Angel. Okay, come on come on. Come on. Okay. (car engine revving) Angel, Angel, stay awake. Stay up, stay with me okay just, just stay awake, just stay with me. - Why is it so quiet? - No, it's not, you're just falling asleep, okay, just open your eyes, come on. - We forgot Shanan. - No, no, no, we're gonna go get her right now okay. But you can't fall asleep. You have to stay awake or you gonna miss Shanan? - Hey play some music. Shanan likes music. - Yeah, yeah, just pay attention okay. (gentle music) (gentle music) Angel. Angel. (gentle music) ♪ The once lonely guy ♪ - Angel, stay awake Angel. Angel. Stay up. Angel stay up, stay with me okay. Angel. (gentle music) ♪ Is love like a river ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ - Angel. Angel. (Jasmine crying) Please. (gentle music) (gentle music) (Jasmine screaming) (Luis moaning) (Luis moaning) - Jesus buddy, the back of your head's all fucked up. - Hospital. Hospital. - I'm sorry, it's not really something we can do. You did good, buddy. We're proud of you. (Luis moaning) (gun firing) (insects chirping) (insects chirping) (insects chirping) (insects chirping) - Should we go looking for Josh? - Nah, he'll be back. (insects chirping) - How much time do you think? - I don't know. (insects chirping) - Is there enough time, is the question. (insects chirping) (insects chirping) Ooh, did you brush your teeth? I don't need to know what chang pussy tastes like. - What, it'll wash off the taste of kike dick. - Ew, oh. (insects chirping) (insects chirping) - Oh come on Jasmine.

(dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - All right. Josh, my man. - Where's Luis? - Oh, he didn't make it, but that's fine, he didn't belong with us anyway. Come on, let's go celebrate. You get any this time? - Yeah, yeah I did. - All right. (all laughing) Yo, I almost died. - Oh my God. I mean, can we please add some more women to the group so we can have like a better ratio of men to women? - Men put up more of a fight. - All right, first of all, that's sexist. And secondly, and more importantly, I cannot be putting up with stuck up bitches for hours and hours on end anymore. I'm so fucking over it. - I thought you were gonna lose it when Angelique interrupted you. - Oh, wait, was that the really dumb bitch? - Oh, you're gonna have to narrow it down. - If we have an Asian girl next round, can I call dibs? - What you find out, you don't like nigga pussy? - I mean, it's fine, I just want to explore my options. - I think we should do an all asian round some time. - No, no, no. - Why not? I'd be up for that. - You gotta stay focused on the problem okay. Asians look up to us. Kikes and niggas do not. - I think niggas look up to us like subconsciously. - No, no, no, there's a difference between looking up to someone and like a primal need, right. Like niggas will always need white people. That's just a fact. There's a reason why so many of them stayed on their plantations even after the Emancipation Proclamation. - Holy shit. (birds chirping) (fire crackling) (fire crackling) - Baby girl. Jasmine. Jasmine. Jasmine. God dammit girl, turn around and look at me when I'm talking to you. - Why huh? What are you gonna tell me that I don't already know? Huh? I know it all, Dad. I live it every day, same as you, day in, day out. What are you gonna tell me this time that you watched Dr. King get shot head? I've heard it already. You gonna tell me how some pigs beat your brother to death to keep them from handcuffing your nine-year-old niece? Guess what? Same old story, I know it. Oh, do you wanna tell me about your fellow Panthers being assassinated left and right without any investigation? I heard it the first 20 times you told me. And I'm sorry, Dad. I am sorry that was your life. I'm sorry you had to live that day in and day out. But I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I just can't do it. And I'm tired. I am so incredibly, I'm completely exhausted. And I'm 18. (gentle music) I shouldn't be burnt out at 18. And I know that life isn't fair, but I can't keep watching my friends enjoy their lives while I'm stuck here with you being told every day how awful the world is. I want a life, Dad. (gentle music) I can't have your life. I can't learn your ways anymore. I don't have the strength to go day to day with your mentality. And I'm sorry that I can't be you. And I'm sorry if you wanted a boy, and I'm sorry if you are alone, but I can't. I can't be alone with you.
