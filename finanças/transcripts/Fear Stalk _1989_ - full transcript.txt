[music playing] Ivan? Oh! Dammit! Dork, get off me! ALEXANDRA: Cut! TOM: Jeez, OK. What is it now? Problem, Susan? He did it again. I can't get the stupid line outif he's laying on my wind pipe. You're praying they can't get the line out, not your wind pipe. Alan, get off her windpipe. Susan, you're in the wrong position. Move. All right, reset. We'll go from the top. All right, let's go, let's go. TOM: Get ready on three. Thanks. Come on, come on. All right. TOM: Go three. OK, on one. Can we see the rope? We shouldn't see the rope in that shot. Cut to the other camera. TOM: Go one. Ivan? Ready on three. Go three. Ready on two. Go two. Bring up one. Tighter. Tighter on one. Go one. Three times is enough, it's not jump rope. And ready on two. Go. Two. - Tom? Yes, I've got it. We'll take care of it in editing. Ready on one. And go one. I don't know why theykeep putting her so much. Cut after this. The second one. [screaming] Arthur, help! TOM: Ready on three. ALEXANDRA: Go to the master. TOM: And we are out. [bell] ALEXANDRA: Why is it a race to the finish? Once I'd like to have time for a retake. That's what we've got editing for. Thank you very much, everybody. Good work, well done. GROUP: [SINGING] For he's a jolly fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow,for he's a jolly good fellow. Hold the elevator for me. GROUP: Which nobody can deny. Which nobody can deny. What did I get him? I like champagne. Dom peringon. You're good. Thank you. Ease up on Susan, Ally. Susan. Why did I cast her? I must have had a psychotic episode. You're right. She is a pain in the neck, butyou've got to gentle her along. You got to. You're the director. I'm the producer. You are a tough broad. That's what you like. Sometimes. I'm going to skip the party. I've got to get down to editing. Hi there. Don't have your agent call me again. Sixteen weeks, I promise you. Hi, hi, hi. You were very good. I liked it. Cut Donna's hair. 19, OK. And neat. Champagne. I cannot wait to do that again. [applause] This is not food. In any way, shape or form. Well, it is a big piece ofcake for the birthday man. Every night at my hotel I find out how it is. He shows up, he gets to thehotel, calls his brother, he said how's Kitty? His brother says, right, Kitty's dead. How is mom? And the brother says, Mom was up on the roof, playing with a little red ball. I'm the actor. How come I can't get a spread like this? ALEXANDRA: You don't sleepwith the right people. Oh. All right, guys. Got to go. Good night. Night. ALEXANDRA: See you later. Don't tell me this. Somebody's stolen things out of my purse. Where? In the parking lot? I don't know. Upstairs, in the studio. I don't know. Virgina, call the police. Are you sure? Did you look carefully? This. Dammit. My cards, I checked with my money. Driver's license, addressbook, my appointment book. I don't believe this. So what's the prognosis? I mean for the address bookor the appointment book. POLICEMAN: Well. Right. Thank you gentlemen. I'm staying over tonight. We'll have some supper, watch a little TV. At least you don't have to use a credit card. I'll stop off, get some sushi. Do not get hung up, here. I'll be over in 20 minutes. You leaving? ALEXANDRA: Yeah. We're sending Fred a scriptto your house by modem. Can you lend me $20? $10. Don't be depressed. All right. Hey, baby. How the hell are you? ALEXANDRA: Watch it. You heard here, I'll break both your arms. TOM: What are you talking about? She loves it. Come on. It's getting soggy. It's almost done. OK. Just things. Start again. That's very healthy. And un-compulsive of you. A new Ally Maynard. I like it. Pretty soon, you know what? You are going to be driving your automobile with a very dirty ashtray. Mm? I want you to hurt me now. Enchanting. Oh, yeah. Making love on the kitchen floor. Are you getting sushi all over me? If I want to. Sugarbaby. Dollface. WOMAN: Do you have the revisions ready? MAN: Yeah, those are green pages. Morning. I'm on the Ds, takingeverything off the roledex. You're perfect. If you weren't married-- I'd be living on what you pay me. Hello? Yeah? VIRGINA: [ON SPEAKER PHONE] Your son on one. Hi, darling. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Why? - You're fine. But Mom, I just got a message from the dean that the police called. What? They said you were in a serious accident, and to call your secretary. I'm perfectly OK. You're talking to me. I don't know, must been a mix up. I guess you got someone else's message. But with your telephone numberon it, and Virginia's name? Well. I can't explain it. But I'm fine. Swear. How's school? It's-- it's fine, Mom. I tell you, one of your stupid friends has a sick sense of humor. The dean didn't say who called, did he? DANNY: No. No, just an man. He said he's with the Beverly Hills Police. ALEXANDRA: Sorry youwere frightened, darling. You know, I'm going to calla friend of mine over there and see what he can find out. I love you. I love you, too. I'll talk to you later. Bye. V. Get Richard Danning, Beverly Hills Police. JENNIFER: So what did Detective Danning say? ALEXANDRA: He's checking the call. DORIS: One of Danny'sfriends was doing a number. ALEXANDRA: He thought itwas one of my sick friends. JENNIFER: Yeah, probably Doris. You ever seen her phone bill? All those 976 numbers? DORIS: Once. I dialed once. JENNIFER: I don't think this is funny, Ally. Would you just come and meet this woman? This is exactly the kind ofthing that she deals with. She's an ex-cop. ALEXANDRA: Another one of your crazies. What could it hurt? What could it hurt? You remember last summer whenshe dragged us to that channel. $200 to hear a 3,000 yearold dog growl in Swahili. The est, the crystals, themantras, the maharishi. DORIS: You're going back fifteen years. JENNIFER: There's no statute oflimitations on her craziness. ALEXANDRA: Would you come on? JENNIFER: This one only deals with women. ALEXANDRA: Oh, forget it, Jen. It's over, I'm fine. I don't want to think about it anymore. Alexandra doesn't want to think about it, therefore, it isn't. A bench! I had my purse snatched. Who hasn't? [phone ringing] Now what? Hello? Let's eat. This is Dr. Birken. No, I'm sorry, I'm not that kind of doctor. I'm a psychotherapist. No, you must be mistaken. I'm looking right at her. How did you get this number? Some creep. What? What? A man. He said you were hit by a car. OK. Eliminate the credit cards and the cash. Most of you have credit card protection, and the cash is a loss. All right. Driver's license, ID. Medical and autoinsurance, business cards. The usual. Checkbooks. Here's a savings passbook. How long since you emptied out your purses? 1942. All right, Linda. You're 35 years old. You bank at Fidelity, and here's your account number and your address and yourtelephone number on your check. Mother's maiden name, Baker. Divorced, judging by your age and the listed beneficiary on your insurance, Jason Barton, relationship friend. OK, so it's a great act. Now can we get out of here? Now, why is this just a women's issue? Don't men get ripped off? My business is women, not men. But what does the averageman carry with him? A wallet, driver's license,a few credit cards. Men travel lighter than women. In essence they live more defensively. Not stuff. We love stuff. It makes us feel secure tocarry everything with us. Then our purse is stolen. Then all that security, all that power is in someone else's hands. Let's take a break. ALEXANDRA: They pay peoplefor anything these days. Where did you find this one? I saw her on a talk show. She quit the police forcea couple of years ago and started this. She works with rape victims,teaches kids how to defend themselves against creeps. She's hot stuff. OK. I called her. Barbara Ivanello, Ally Maynard. I'm glad you could come. Jennifer told me whathappened with your purse, and about the phone calls. As usual she overreacted. I mean, I don't think they're really related. If I handed you a script and said, these things are a coincidence,you throw me out of the office. Only if it wasn't funny. Look, I'm not big into paranoia. Fair enough. How about just being careful? Were your keys stolen? Nope. Do you keep an extraset of house keys on you? Yeah. In your makeup pouch. Are they still there? You better change locks. What about the bank? Have you been there since the theft? Nope. I bank by phone, through my computer. BARBARA: I'd change the account. Would you give me a break? BARBARA: Look. A couple of months ago a woman called me. Her purse had been rifled. Just the contents stolen. A few weeks later another womancame to see me, same situation. Now both of them have hada few problems since then. I'm sorry I'm not buying into this. There's no reason to assume this isn't an ordinary, garden variety pickpocket Yes, there is. Think about it. I hate people who do this. Frighten people. BARBARA: Not frightening you, Ally, you are. I'm pointing out the reality. That can help you, fear can't. It's useless and I don't traffic in it. [beep] [phone ringing] Yes? Hello? STALKER: [WHISPERING ONPHONE] I like your picture. Driver's license. People always look terrible. Not you, Alexandra. Who's this? Who is this? Who is this? [click] [dial tone] What color would you like? ALEXANDRA: Blue I guess. I don't care. Just transfer the money frommy old account to this new one. It's $11,000 and change. We show you have an account balance of $600. That's impossible. I just balanced my account on the computer. It's $11,000 and something. Ms. Maynard, it shows that you made three telephone withdrawalsyesterday totaling $11,000. You made a mistake. I did not. Does anyone in your familyhave access to your bank codes? Please, I'm divorced, andmy son's away at school. BANKER: The transfers weremade from your access number. I don't give a damnwhat they were made from. I didn't transfer $11,000 out of my own account. I'm afraid it isn't only yourchecking account, Ms. Maynard $12,000 was transferredout of your savings account in small amounts, in three separate withdrawals. I don't believe this. Unlikely, but not impossible. With sophisticated computer equipment, working knowledge of bankingprocedures, telephone systems, it's been done. If they had the bank access number and hers, they could use any computeras though it were Ms. Maynard. Where do you keep your access numbers? In my address book. BANKER: We expressly tell our clients-- ALEXANDRA: Oh give me a break. They were just numbers I wrotein the back of my address book. They didn't relate to anything. I wrote them down so I wouldn't forget them. I don't memorize lists of numbers, it's not one of my tricks. A useful trick. Right. So where does that leave me? POLICEMAN: Well right nowwe don't have any proof that these transfers weren't made from your own computer by youor someone in your family. So-- - Wait a minute. Are you going to let me finish explaining, or do you just want to talk? Don't give me any lectures, officer. I'm the victim here, not the felon. This guy knows a lot about me. What if he comes after me? Now that's doubtful. I think he called me this morning. A man called. I doubt that. These guys don't want any-- ALEXANDRA: Do you want to let me finish, or do you just want to talk? The guy who called mentionedmy driver's license. He's got to be the one who stole my things. Change your number. Why should I have to do everything? What are you doing? Change my number. Just like that. I have an unlisted number. Do you know how many peopleI would have to contact, how many places I do business with? Change my number. It would be easier to change my sex. Don't change your number. Ms. Maynard, don't change your sex. You let us do our job, andyou go about doing yours. We'll be in touch. What? VIRGINA: [ON PHONE] Having a nice day? What's up, Virgina? I'm not in the mood for cute. OK. Why'd you cancel lunch with Henry Sloan? I didn't. Well his secretary called. Plenty hostile, as only she canbe, and said that a man called their service left word that Ms.Maynard it was canceling lunch. No reschedule. Henry was a little ticked off. Ticked off? Nobody cancels lunch with Henry and lives. Three months ofnegotiating down the tubes. What man left word? What? Call back. Call back and tellHenry, talk him yourself. Tell him I didn't cancel. It was-- just tell him I'll explain it to him later. Make sure he understands I didn't cancel. Got it. [phone ringing] ALEXANDRA: V, hold the calls. Mom. Hi. I'll be with you in a minute. Alexandra, if you neededmoney, why didn't you tell me? What? What do you mean, what? The bank manager called me. He said you tried to withdraw$10,000 from our joint account. Oh, God. Oh, God. Ally, are you in trouble? Darling? You're frightening me. Yes. Yes, Mom. I'm in trouble. RICHARD: Ally, don't get crazy because some guys downtown gave you a hard time. They don't know who you are. You come on tough, Ally. You're looking for answers,and they don't have any yet. I know you. I like you anyway. They don't. I don't care if they like me. I want them to take care of business, like I do. OK, forget it. I blew it. They hate me. I thought you didn't care. I don't. What is this, a job interview? What does your personalityhave to do with it. RICHARD: That's a good question. Anybody out there got a hate on for you? Half of Hollywood. And the other half don't know you. ALEXANDRA: Come on, you don'tthink it's someone I know. PEARL: What is this, Richard? A maniac is after my daughter. He's shrugging and making jokes. RICHARD: I know, Pearl. I'm not taking this lightly. I think you know me betterthan that, it's just, well, I don't know. My instincts, it's a pro. Maybe a group. I don't think there's anypersonal danger involved. These guys, they usuallydon't look for relationships. They like to get in and out, real clean. How do you know? RICHARD: We don't. We look for patterns. But it's dumb to speculate. Now look, Ally, what I'm going to do is alert my people to what's going on here. We'll go through our files, we'll interface with your security people, and if you see or you hear anything out ofthe ordinary, trip your alarm. Right. And by the time they get there, you're dead. Pearl, our response time is-- Don't get me your response time. I know all about it. A woman was beaten to death in front of her apartment, 20 peopleheard screaming, nobody came. That was New York. This is Beverly Hills. Nothing ever happens in Beverly Hills. There's Charles Manson-- ALEXANDRA: Ma. RICHARD: Pearl. Please don't worry. Don't worry. Why didn't I think of that? You're making me crazy. You really don't thinkthey'll come to my house? No. I don't think that's the pattern. [phone ringing] Yes. STALKER: [WHISPERING ON PHONE]I have your home number. I have your car number. I have your number. [laughing] [shouting] [whistle] [chanting] $70,000 later, I opened an envelope that arrived in the mail. All my credit cards, my license, my bank book. Everything was returned, and it was over. Nothing has happened since. How does he pick his victims? Does he know them? No. We don't think so. He picks an area to work,then he selects his victims. Each of them had publicityprior to the theft. I had a story done on me in the View section. BARBARA: He knew what you lookedlike from her picture, where she worked. The Department of MotorVehicles gave him the rest. He staked out the parking lot, tailed her, and she made it easy. She left her purse in the car. The car was locked. My purse was under my jacket. I was gone maybe five minutes, tops. Takes 10 seconds for a pro to jimmy a lock. He had time for shower and a shave. You were even easier. The magazine article a month ago. Everything he needed is here. Your work, home, hobbies. Even the fact thatyou're a computer junkie, and you bank that way. What makes you think it's one man? Richard thinks that might be a ring. No. I hate to disagree with Sergeant Danning. He used to be my boss. But this kind ofharassment is a solo job. See this guy doesn't just hitthe bank accounts and get out. He phones his victims. All women. He wants them to hear his voice. He wants to hear their fear. No, it's one guy. He's a control freak. He gets off on it. One man. BARBARA: Call your son. Tell him what's going on. Change your number. Unlisted, no referrals. Be careful who you give the new number to, the same with the new key. My whole life is-- BARBARA: It'll be over. He takes what he wants, hassome fun with his victims, and when he's finished he leaves your life. When he's finished. BARBARA: Yeah. That's what control is. ALEXANDRA: Yes, this is Alexandra Maynard. Yes, did you deliver a dress to me? DRY CLEANERS: [ON PHONE] Yes. It's mine, but I didn'task to have it delivered. DRY CLEANERS: [ON PHONE] Oh your husband called. What? DRY CLEANERS: [ON PHONE] Hesaid to bring it right over. Is there a problem? - No. No, it's all right. It's all right. Thank you. [phone ringing] Yes. STALKER: [WHISPERING ON PHONE] Alexandra. You almost forgot your dress. Listen you twisted, sick-- [click] So if the police aren't worried, are you? Sometime I get this wave of panic, like someone's watching me. Who knows everything about me. It makes me so furious. Why don't you stay at myplace until it quiets down? You and my mother. You and me. Not your mother. Don't start, Tom. All right, I'll take your mother, too. Don't, don't start. Don't start. Alexandra, and you don't want to start anything. Come on, Tom. I want to be with you. You are. Don't be cute. I'll swat you. You keep trying tosettle me down, move me in. It's not an obscene suggestion. I was settled down for half my life. I'm enjoying my independence. I'm not going to let this situation scare me into becoming dependent. I don't want you scared or dependent. I want you at your best. I like what we have. I do too. I want more. More isn't necessarily better. Do I have to take you at your word? Tom, I just-- I can't do this tonight. I have too much on my mind. TOM: Come on, Ally. Ease up. Let me help you take things off your mind. ALEXANDRA: Can't get something off your mind unless you're a moron. You can only suppress it. Moronic suppression. I like that. Be right back. Got to check the service. Studio's supposed to call. Check mine, too? [phone ringing] Hello? STALKER: [WHISPERING ON PHONE] Jennifer? Yeah. Who's this? STALKER: [WHISPERING ON PHONE]I friend of Alexandra's. Not as close a friend as youare, but I'm getting there. Who is this? STALKER: [WHISPERING ON PHONE]I'll be keeping in touch. [laughter] Wait a minute. What do you want? [click] That moronic suppression, I like it. It has a certain flair to it. How about a little now? Hm? Tom. Come on, Ally. Stop it. Right in the middle of a parking lot. No. Hm? Nothing? Come on, sugar. No. Come on. Let go of me. Stop! [sobbing] Ally. Hey. It was a joke, Ally. Aw, darling, I was kidding. Ally, you're not easy. I become a clown. I misread you. Oh. You were holding me. Ally. I was trying to act a suppressed moron. Did you think I was serious? I don't know, I just-- I just panicked. And I couldn't get free. You scared me. Shh. Shh, shh. I want to be alone tonight. Oh, honey, come on. I'm not angry at you. It's him. I got it all mixed up withyou, but it's not you. I just can't let this man make me afraid to be alone in my own house. I won't push. I love you. Call me if you get neurotically dependent, or you just need some loving. [phone ringing] ANSWERING MACHINE: Hi. Please leave your name,number and a brief message after the tone. [beep] WILLY: [ON PHONE] Ally. I thought you'd be home bynow, I want to send the script. I'm here. I'm here. I didn't pick up in time. I'm sorry Willy. Hey, that's OK. I'll tell you what, I'll giveyou five minutes to set up, and then I'll send. OK. [printer] [beep] [beep] God. [doorbell] Ally? It's me. [knocking] It's Jen. Ally. It's me. I checked to see if Tom's car was here, I thought he was staying. He called me, too. What did you say? Nothing. Just the typical garbage. Why was he calling you? I can't stand it. What the hell does he want? Exactly what he's getting. OK. I'm not giving into this. That's why I wouldn't let Tom spend the night. I know. And I know you. But what's the point of notletting anybody help you? It's not the help I mind. It's needing it. [knocking] Don't kill me, I called the girls. ALEXANDRA: Oh, for heaven's sake. Don't be crazy, Ally. Just go with it. He called both of us. I've got the wieners ifyou've got the marshmallows. I'm cutting this where he grabs her throat. Why? It's a good moment. It's too violent, we don't need it. You're cutting violence? The blood and gore queen of daytime? It's gratuitous. No it's not. It's absolutely right for the scene. I say black, you say white? No. You are making a bad judgment call. I disagree with it. It happened yesterday too, Ally. You ripped apart a perfectly good scene. I didn't want it. I didn't want it. Apparently. I put the scene back, all right? Yeah. And we lost an hour and a half. You're in a lousy mood. You too. Drove by the house last night,just to see how you were. Looked like a witches coven. ALEXANDRA: The group came over. I got it. I didn't invite them,they were worried about me. So am I. What was I supposed to do? Throw them out? You threw me out. ALEXANDRA: I don't believe this. I don't believe I'm hearing this. I don't like it when you cut me out, Ally. I don't. I don't mean to. But you do. You hide things from me, and you share them with your girlfriends. Makes me feel competitive. You are so easy withthem, and so restrictive, rigid in our relationship. You ever notice you never stay at my house? I always stay at your house. ALEXANDRA: That's because-- Because you have to have control. Your things around you. Your clock, your sheets, your schedules. It's more convenient. TOM: For you. For us it would be more convenient if we lived together. That would mean what, Ally? Commitment? You know I tried toexplain it to you last night, and you didn't get it. I got it. I don't buy it. Hi. Your new telephone number,and your housekeeper called. They installed the new telephones. What phones? I asked them to change thenumbers, not the phones. Well, Marion said they took out the gray ones, and they put in red and green ones. I thought you wereredecorating for Christmas. Who came to the house? A guy from the phone company. Bull. Ally. Ally? Ally. It was probably a mistakeat the phone company. No. He was at my house. He knows everything I do. Now just when he can get away with something, he just walks into my housean changes the phones. Ally, think about it. Even if it was him, you weren't there. No one was hurt. It's a sick joke. The whole thing is sick. But it isn't dangerous. Not dangerous? I mean physically. He'll get tired, just likehe did with the other women, and he'll disappear. You'll be able to go on with your life. Please, don't do this to yourself. I'm not doing this to myself. He's doing it to me. But you're letting him. Why is the burden on me not to react when someone is attacking me? Don't make this my fault. Ally, put this in perspective. What is wrong with you? There is nothing wrong with me. There's something wrong with him. You know, my girlfriends understand exactly what's going on. I don't have to explain it to them. Because you all react in the same way. No, we don't. We react differently. We feel the same way. [beeping] [phones ringing] STALKER: [WHISPERING ON PHONE] Aren't you glad I had your Valium refilled? I thought you might be needing them. I don't need them, you do. If you were here I'd shovehim down your throat, you son of a bitch. [phone ringing] No you don't. I'm not living with this. No. Not this one either. Where were you? What did you touch? Huh? Did you touch these? Where were you? [phone ringing] You're not going to come intomy house and do this to me. [alarm] Oh God, he's here. SECURITY SERVICE: Mrs.Maynard, are you all right? ALEXANDRA: No! No! SECURITY SERVICE: Mrs. Maynard. What is your code? It's him, he's here. SECURITY SERVICE: Please stay where you are, and don't approach the windows. The police have been notified. We have a car in the area. They're on the wa-- STALKER: [ON PHONE] Alexandra. Alexandra. Alexandra, I want in. Alexandra. Alexandra. ALEXANDRA: No. No. STALKER: [ON PHONE] Alexandra. Alexandra. Alexandra. Alexandra. Alexandra. Alexandra. Alexandra. [laughing] All right, what's the situation? There's no sign of entry. OK. Police. Police. No! Mrs. Maynard, it's the Beverly Hills Police. Open the door. No! How do I know it's you? Sir, stay back at your car, please. Stay back until we can assess the situation. I'm a friend of Ms. Maynard's.What happened? Is she all right? - I don't know just yet. Just stay still, please. Sir! Ally? Ally, it's Richard. Come on, let me get to her. Ally honey, it's Tom. Everything is all right. Just open the door if you can. Ally? Ally. Come on, Ally. He isn't here, is he? He isn't here? He doesn't have to be here, does he? He doesn't have to be here. He can do it without being here. RICHARD: He triggered the alarm by remote. He wasn't in the house. Even the phone guy was legit. If you stay here a few days, when he doesn't get a response at thehouse he's going to get bored, then he'll move on. Now look, your bags are up in the room. When you get up there call the family, let them know where you are. No one else, OK? - Thanks. - OK. Goodnight, Tom. Thanks. How can I do this? I blew three meetings last week. Willy's all over me. I have a new character coming out in six days, I haven't even looked at the tests. That's what they pay your staff for. No, that's what the network pays me for. Come on. I'll take you up to your room. No, I'm fine, I'm fine, really. All right then. Listen up. I'll be right back after the shoot for an early morning breakfast. Oh, listen, when you shootthe scene with Susan make sure that little sleaze doesn't throwher mustache all over the-- That mouth. That mouth. When will you ever let something go? How can you stand me? I'm a sick man. I fell in love with you. TV: Take great pleasure in presenting to you that charming and gifted personality, Miss Angelica Evans. Honestly, Charlie, I thoughtyou'd never get here. [SINGING] I miss thatfeeling of your hand in mine. I miss that feeling that was so divine. There's no need to tell you that I need you so. No need to tell you'cause how well you know. [knocking] [screaming] BARBARA: It was the credit card. When the hotel credit putit through the credit check, he tapped in, got the location. The couple in the next room are two old people from Kansas City. He's watching me. He knows everything about me. Ally, he's smart and resourceful, but he's not omnipotent. Don't credit the slimewith more than he deserves. Ally. Where was it? RICHARD: Outside the door. Was it with the things he took? He was here. It doesn't stop, does it? I spent my life pretendingnot to be afraid. Of school, of boys, of other women, of work. Of no work. Of success, of failure, of marriage, of divorce. Of being a mother, of loosing my children. Of being poor, of crying, God. Just doesn't stop. BARBARA: Yes, it does. This fear isn't in your mind, it's real. And you can make it stop. I want to get this guy. There's got to be a way to nail him. There's a way to nail everyone. The cops don't think so. I didn't say everyone gets nailed. I said there's a way to do it. [gunshots] OK. Keep your left hand here for support. Got it. You're not a cowboy. Now when you're ready fire two rounds, pause, then fire two more, and pause. [gunshots] What did I get? Nothing. Nothing. You're flinching as you release the round, and your shots are going wild. Why does it have to be the outline of a man? What happened to the old bullseye? If you don't want to hit somebody, let's walk out of here right now. You don't have to do this, Ally. I'll do it if I have to sleep in this joint. [gunshots] RICHARD: Barbara, you retiredfrom the force two years ago. Why don't you back off and let us handle this? You can't stop me from hiring her privately. OK, look, I've got some stats on this guy. You know the m.o. is identical. Eight months ago in Denver fourwomen had their purses rifled. Significant amounts of money were withdrawn from their account. There was harassment all the way down the line. A year ago April, Philadelphia. Same situation. Only contact by phone, a male voice. Possible third situation. What does that tell us, Richard? That he's done this before? We knew that. You've got a make on it? Witnesses? Voiceprint? He's done this clear acrossthe country and nobody's gotten close to him. Richard, what we're doingmay set him up for you. Don't work me, Barbara. You don't have the manpower to put on this. You don't needmanpower to get this guy, you get him with a computer, youmatch his MO with his skills. You find out where he worked. I know the drill, Richard. In two weeks if nothingbreaks and nobody's dead, it's history. You said yourself, they don't think of this as life threatening. Well Ally, at this point,we just don't think it is. Maybe not by police standards, but by mine it's life threatening. OK, I'm not going to get into this. You're a private citizen. I can advise you againstit, but I can't stop you. You're on record. Ally, here's what we can do. I'll put a tap on your line. I'll leave the unit there for another week. After that-- That's fine. Barbara? I need to talk to you. I'll meet you at the car. Just what the hell do you think you are going to get this guy to do? Lose his grip, get mad. If Ally can throw him,challenge him, change his m.o. He may start to get creativeand he may make a mistake. RICHARD: He may escalate his behavior, also. We know that. There's something I left out, Barbara. The woman in Philadelphia. She's dead. How? RICHARD: Fire. And the file is still open. Then you don't know. No, I don't know, you don't know either. Maybe an accident, maybe it wasn't. You want to take that chance? You're the one who didn't tell Ally. Why? Because I wanted to see if you would. You really want this one bad, don't you? Don't you? Not bad enough to jeopardize Ally. BARBARA: Who's working who now, Richard? Everything I know, Ally will know. Just don't do anything stupid, Barbara. I won't. I'm not a stupid woman. RICHARD: Or reckless. You've got a hell of a nerve. If you want this guy, you're a good cop. If I want him, I'm reckless. RICHARD: Good, here comes the manifesto. Don't play that with me. Now you know who wants thisguy more than you or I? Ally. Every time this animal pulls her chain, he takes a little more outof her, and I want it back. You should have stayed a cop, Barbara. You like the action. I do better work now that I'm not. Ow. [thump] [drawers opening] Ally? Are you crazy? What the hell is wrong withyou, I could have killed you. Am I crazy? Am I crazy? How could you? You know what's going on here, I told you. How could you just walk inmy house without knowing it. You gave me the new key,Ally, while you were still sane. I came to pack your things. You're getting out of here before you're as nutty as he is. Oh, Mom. [sobbing] I can't believe I lived to seemy daughter pull a gun on me. In her own house. [laughing] You know what the two ofus must have looked like? Is this funny? Ally, you have to get out of here. I got this today. It's only a picture, Ma. [phone ringing] Hello? STALKER: [ON PHONE] I havea message for your friend. Don't push me. Right. And she has one for you. Your move, big shot. Ally says it's your move, big shot. It's your move. TOM: OK everybody. We're going to show this, walk away. [bell] And 5, 4, 3, 2. SUSAN: I know I saw her. She was there. TOM: Ready to go to three. Hello? Ally? OK on one. Go, one. Yes? DANNY: [ON PHONE] Danny. Oh, hi darling. It's OK, it's Danny. I'll take it in there. DANNY: [ON PHONE] Mom? I want to come home. Why? I just do. ALEXANDRA: [ON PHONE] No, no, Danny not now. It's just not the right time. He called me. When? A couple of nights ago. I told grandma, but she told me not to tell you. What did he say? Just stuff. ALEXANDRA: [ON PHONE] What did he say? It was disgusting, Mom. Danny, I have to know what he said. It was filthy. About what he wants to do to you. Oh, Danny. Danny, I'm so sorry. JENNIFER: Oh! Oh, no! Let me go! STALKER: Shut up! [screaming] STALKER: Oh, yeah. Tell your friend Ally how good is. Oh, Jen. Next time it might be you, not Jennifer. Next time you might not be so lucky. This happened to Jen becauseher name was in my phone book. I guess that's lucky. She might have been raped because I wrote her address in my book. She could even be dead because she's my friend. I guess that's lucky. That's lucky. Ally, Ally. The guy is crazy. The more involved you get,the crazier you'll get. You're carrying a gun in your purse. So? So, can you use it? What's the big deal? You look, you shoot, somebody dies. Can you use it? Yes. You can. Yes. You can put two inches of steel into the soft tissue of another human being? Watch him bleed? You can do that? Yes. I don't know. TOM: Don't make this a personal battle. This is a personal battle. He's after me, my friends,my mother, my son. He's made this the mostpersonal battle of my life. Are we in place with that tap yet? Yeah. Good. DORIS: I'm sick. You finished the whole sweet and sour. Don't talk about it, I'm sick. Nothing. He hasn't called for three days. He's regrouping. Willie hasn't sent the script over. It's too early. [doorbell] It looks like Miami Vise out there. Ma. PEARL: I know you're goingto do something stupid. Can I talk you out of it? No. So what am I going to do? Sit in my house and shiver? I might as well be here. Don't look at me like that. Who do you think you got all your nerve from? Just don't shoot me. Pearl. Hi. Oh, look at that garbage. At least you could have let me cook for you. What is she doing? What is it? What do you need him for? She could scare of the life out of you. He's changed his pattern. What do you mean? It just occurred to me. Talk. You're making me nervous. [phone ringing] Hello? STALKER: [ON PHONE] Full house, Ally? [explosion] I guess I can scare you twice. Your move, bitch. BARBARA: It's a timer device. Are you satisfied? Look, I know how you feel. You do? Maybe. But just in case there's a misunderstanding, let me tell you how I feel. You want to live your lifeon the edge of danger, fine. But when you drag my defenselessdaughter into it with you-- BARBARA: Wait a minute. I didn't steal your daughter's things, or threaten her, or drive her friends and her family nearly crazy. Now somebody else did that. And I want him. When are you going to make that commitment? There's nothing defenseless about Ally, or you either Mrs. Maynard. You're a killer. Why don't you cripple the enemy instead of yourself and your daughter. This is Danning, good work. Lock it in. We got it, we trapped the call. We got a trace on it now, it'salmost over, Ally, we got him. Give me two guys over hereright away, in the back. Get those guys in the car. Sargent, I want four guys in here. Richard? RICHARD: Yes. - You have his number? - We got it. RICHARD: We got it. - Give it to me. Look, we're working on it now, there's nothing more you can do.- Please give me his number. RICHARD: No. Ally. Look, precise timing is what we need right now. I'll use it once. RICHARD: No. I have to. Please, give it to me. This is more important to me.- Ally, no. [tires screeching] Come on. Give me something. Yes! RICHARD: Down there. What have you got? Nothing here. POLICEMAN: How about inthe back there, anything? POLICEMAN: No, nothing. All clear here. Guy's out of here. You think on those catwalks up there? Aw, no sign of him. Dammit, Ally! I thought you'd call. Well? You tipped him, Ally. He split. Dammit. I'm so sorry. It's OK, Ally. We'll get him. The important thing ishe's out of your life now, it's over for you. There it you. He always leaves the personalitems and his equipment when he's ready to split. It's his m.o. He doesn't hang around waiting to get nailed. So this round is over. It's our problem now. ALEXANDRA: Is it? RICHARD: I know this isn't finished the way you wanted it to be,but in terms of your life, he's out of it. Terms of my life. He's still out there, he canstill hit on someone else. RICHARD: It's the best we can do for now. Ally. For God's sake, give yourself a break. Put this behind you. Take control of your life again. Hi. Remember me? Give me a second. It's over. They didn't get him, but he's-- he's gone. So now I get you back. I know. I don't know why you'd want me. Are you staying over? No, no. Not tonight. I just came by. Now I remember you. But I'm staying long enough. Ally. When are you going to start dealing with what's happened to you? Whenever. TOM: When are we going to deal with what's been happening to us? and - I am. Now. TOM: Sex first and life after, huh? ALEXANDRA: Mm-hm. You're one of those people who never has to deal with anything. Maybe. TOM: Ally. You cannot have my bodyuntil we deal with things. Later. When you're right, you're right. Hi, Henry. What's up at this hour? Me. Delivery from the studio. Sorry about the time, but theyonly called about an hour ago. Writers. They never know what time it is. [phone ringing] Yes? STALKER: Wear it when I come for you, Ally. You got it, Mister. One on one. Just you and me. 911 OPERATOR: [ON PHONE] 911 emergency. BARBARA: [ON PHONE] Hello. Barbara. It's not over. He just called me. He expects surveillance,so he'll avoid the front door and the garage. That leaves the backdoor. We leave it unlocked. He has to go around to get to it, that means he's got a perfectview of Ally's bedroom window. We'll know when he's coming. He can't resist announcingit, it's his pattern. He thinks she's alone. That gives us a momentaryadvantage of surprise. Don't waste it. You don't have any training,so I want each of you to focus on one thing. Jen. His left arm is yours. Don't see any other part of him. Everything you have goes into disabling that arm. Now I know it might sound silly, but you make that arm the enemy. Sandy. His right arm is yours. Same thing. Do what you have to, Pearl. Never mind. I know the part I want. JENNIFER: I just want five minutes with him. How much you want to bet when it's available you won't want it? You're on. [doorbell] Front door. This is it. He's on his way. Oh! STALKER: Not a sound. Not a sound. Stop struggling. Don't move. You should have let it be. I would have gone away. But now I can't. I'm not alone. You're not alone? I know that. That's why I sent the dolly. You see, little girls love dollies. They all go rushing to the front door, and the boogeyman comes in the back. You said we'd be alone. But I like this better. I want do do it right under their noses. Yeah, that's right. Think about it. No, no, no, no. ALEXANDRA: Ah! God, no. Now that was a mistake. Shut up! Nobody can come in here for you. Not the cops, not your friends. They're all afraid I'll hurt you. And I will. [WHISPERING] Get back with them. So this is what it is. It's going to happen slowly. You're going to live hereand I just like this. All night if I want. And it's gonna happen when I'm ready. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, looks. [knocking] Ally? [WHISPERING] Answer her. Tell her you're going to sleep. You all right? [WHISPERING] Tell her. Take a good look, becauseit's not going to matter. No! I'm not all right! Oh! Put the gun down. I will kill her. Get into the other room! BARBARA: OK. It's a standoff. I got the gun, and you got her. Why don't you put the knife down, and I'll put the gun down. No way. Come on-- STALKER: Don't move. Put the gun down and walk out of the room. Shoot him. Shoot him! Shoot him! Put it down. ALEXANDRA: No! Come on. He can only cut me, but he'll be dead. STALKER: Put it down! ALEXANDRA: He's not going to putme through this anymore, now! Now! No, no, look. Look at him. Please, look. He's a man. He's just a man. He can't hurt you. Do it. He's not walking out of here, no. With me, not without me. - Put it down! ALEXANDRA: No! Put it down! ALEXANDRA: No! Ally, no! [laughter] STALKER: What is that, Ally? You think he can do something with that? No, baby. No. You can't do it. I'm coming for you, Ally,and you still can't do it. I'm coming for you, Ally. You're mine. [gunshot] [bird song] It's been 14 days, Ally. Honey, after what you've been through, I don't want to lose you now. I'm beginning to be afraid. I'm surfacing. I didn't want to. I wanted to stay down there,where I didn't have to hear. This morning was the firsttime I didn't hear that sound. It's funny, I was staringat that rock formation out back for the hundredthtime, and I suddenly saw there was this dumb littlebunch of yellow flowers growing out it. Must have been there all along. I don't know, it's corny. It made me feel good. Anyway. I'm back. And I'm here. Thank you. [music playing]
