Fast forward! Stop! Fast forward. A little bit... Stop! Fast back. Stop! Stefan Ciugudeanu, the guy with the strike at the shipyard. Sentenced to 12 years, set free after the revolution. I proposed him to cooperate but he refused. - It's him who spread weapons? - Yes. Take care of him. LOOK FORWARD IN ANGER Go to hell! Ciugudean! Go to the director. Did you call me? You are a pig, Ifrim! That's why you didn't get a notice. If you look for him, he is on the bottom of the Danube. It was you who agreed, too that he was there. Hello, Fane! Won't you buy two wedding rings? - 24-carat... - Leave me alone! One vodka! Give him one from overseas, made in Dimos' laboratory. It's on me. One vodka! I didn't understand. I have been fired and you play the fool? - I was fired, too. - You alone had to be fired! Drink, that's why you are here! Pasca, mind your own business! Pascute, please... Be quiet. I'm quiet, Greek. Pascute, I asked you... Keep quiet! Okay! Go to hell, Pasca! It's hot! - Nelu, bring cold water! - Okay! What are you doing, Nelu? Does your father wash himself? - You're stinking like shit! - And you like a not perfumed mare. Fane, leave me alone! - Nelu is coming! - I am not... Lucky you, you knocked! How many things can you do simultaneously? Leave me alone, Nelu, I've written work tomorrow! They are in the bathroom. He is washing mum... At this time? Why are you not at school? Epidemic virus hepatitis! Don't you dare to inf ect me. I'll kill you if you do! Who wants a quarter of a hundred for carrying a bag should come with me. Mr. Director is building a bunker. Are you self-sufficient, Fane? They have announced the list... - Ciugudean! - Only two jobs as a mechanic... I've made you a proposition. I was waiting for an answer. Hello! Nelu... the slippers. - Where is father? - He is reading. - Recovering? - If you had done this last year... I would be a lettered unemployed. Did you tell her? I could see you didn't. - Father, father! - What is it, son? Everything will be okay! If Ifrim does not like you, why would he like me? You should lead this shipyard, not that security guy Ifrim! In Bucharest, it is different... Here, if you piss in bed, the... The capital is the capital. Lucian has got the fourth car. He has got a lot of money, girls as many as sand... Nelu! Don't you hear me? Come home this instant! - How many? - Two. 40 to change. Please... - How many? - Five. - Give me two breads. - Why don't you queue up? Don't worry, people, there is bread enough for everybody. Pasca! - Why don't you sleep at home? - I was thinking at you. They need fishermen at the fish fag. The guys pay well. Why did you beat me and run away and sleep at the neighbours? Did I sleep at the neighbours? Do you think a friendship can end because of a fist blow? You've pushed me in the Danube, under Dimos' toilet... You bastard... If I kick your ass... - How do the privatised pay? - Cash... Yes! Plus fish at half the price. Why don't you hit me, Fane? I won't do it, although that's what I'm thinking about. How can I hit a friend? You don't do it because... ... your so called friends have beaten us enough. I've told you that they would put us, the "dissentients", in jaiI. - What did you say? - Weren't we of that kind? - What kind? - You know very well. Shit, that's what we were! Pasca! I'm expecting you at the fish fag, you jack ass! Correct. Please go on, Vali. Nature gave you everything. I give her an A. - Does she deserve it? - Yes! Next time, when I see your father I'll tell him, that if he gave you such beautiful legs, they deserve to wear proper shoes. This evening, at nine. You can stop now... It stopped... - What's that, Vali? - Why do you go through my things? These are no things. It is money! Where did you get it from? You know I want to go to the college. Don't I need money to go to Bucharest? To pay the rent for the room? I'm asking you, with what money? Perhaps with those you use to buy father the drinking stuff? You love each other! Other women don't know how to stop their husbands from drinking... - You buy it for him! - What did you say? Let's see where you take the money from now that he was fired. - Who was fired? - Your lover boy, my beloved father. You can go to Rotaru, to hire him back. He was after you when... Look what dainties were brought to us by the revolution! Lucretia, is this why I was in jaiI and was beaten? You parasite! Lucretia... I was ashamed to tell you. Money isn't the problem. One can earn it... But where? That's the problem! Give me a strong drink! Come here, my son. I'll make an IT-specialist out of you. - Do you want a beer? - No. No? Neither would I drink such wish-wash. Nelu, pour the left over out in the sink. Are you crazy? This vodka costs 500.000! Neither in this house nor outside will you drink another glass! If you drink outside, that's where you sleep! To be fired for two weeks by now and say no word about it. To pretend every day... ... that he is going to work... Who knows under whose skirt you were? Shut up! You said in the bathroom that one Lucretia is not enough for you. Can I go to the toilet to read? But don't read adventure books! Lucretia, Lucretia... I didn't think about it... The firing, I mean... I've been thinking how to tell you. I was ashamed. I swear you will see Rotaru pushed in the Danube. Have you got something to eat? I'm hungry like a wolf. - He is busy, madam! - Madam is your mother! - Good day. - It remains, as spoken... I'll go now. Hello. Good day! I have got three children, Rotaru! You agreed that Ifrim leaves Fane without job. Listen! It wasn't me who installed Ifrim as director. Fane, your husband, did it. He should go to Ifrim. Or better you go. He might kiss your ass! Yes? He fired him and you agreed. Don't tell me you didn't agree that he threw that brother in law of yours in the Danube. Yes, I would have drowned him, too. I've never seen a worse party secretary. I agreed for Fane to be fired... ...and Fane agreed to all those blockheads taking over the power. We've got only blockheads as leaders. If only someone had read their files... Now, the chosen ones make fun of the working class. Very good! They wanted capitalism, they should work as in capitalism. You see... They wanted capitalism! But not unemployment! Listen, we even don't have Diesel. - What are you laughing at? - Why not? Not even Diesel? In the past, if you needed something, you asked the organisation for it. And they gave you... Now one can't even complain. With so many parties, too many cooks spoiI the broth. What is your opinion on this democracy, Mr. Engineer? Being fired, we especially, after 30 years of work. It's very simple. You fought for a new and free society, that doesn't need you anymore. That's all! He speaks great words I guess he was a party activist. You are the sort of revolutionists that the revolution devours. Besides, in history... Mr. Engineer, why don't you speak in a bag and give it to me. Meal is ready. I'll give the Diesel! Who drinks and smokes must do it seriously. Get lost. Hey men, who wants to go to Bucharest with me should hand over one thousand and 25 dollars. - Where take the money from? - From the others' pockets. Don't you know that today, who has no money is an idiot? Do you see the car over there? My brother left it with me for 10 days, for training. The first hold up will be here. Then we go to Bucharest... - Okay? - Okay! Mr. Engineer, we worked together. Do you have something for me? Fane, this week I've fired 30 people. Come back in 10 days. I'll see what I can do. So many people don't understand, they have to work properly. This has to stop! The work done here is bad. But we want high salaries. The shipyard will be closed. Who do you think will... - Son of a bitch! - Bastard! Hi. Mum, do you know what Briceag said when you went to the market? He said you have got beautiful legs. Nelu, if you don't go to school, you could do something. Go to the gas cylinder deposit and queue f or an old person. - They pay 200 lei. - Not very much. Briceag boasted he's sleeping with his sister. I want to sleep with Vali. You... Let's peel potatoes! Be careful, cut the peel thinly. Potatoes again, mum? Only father likes potatoes. What was wrong with what Briceag said? He boasts like a fool. You should never say things you could be ashamed of. Not even God can get the two of you made up. When I took the flag from the city hall, you beat me... now you boast with the medal... Dimos... What can I do for you? Alcohol is expensive here... Who wants water, can drink it from the Danube. - Tap water. - Serve him! - What do you have downstairs? - Almost nothing... No investments. My bedroom. If you have paper from attorney, you can go and see... - Mr. Dimos... - What do you want? Stop begging... Throw him out! Tell me... Mr. Dimos... There are rumours... - No fire, no smog. - So? If we get you, we close down the place, plus fine and jaiI. - That means... - Mister... Dimos honest Greek. First privatised, taxes paid. Built bread manufacture, help people. Dimos doesn't pay tip. Dimos is European, not Oriental. Mr. Dimos, it's not good to be at war with the police, the doctor and the priest. This saying was told to me by my father, in Thessalonica. Very wise! I'll be damned if he doesn't have whores. I can smell them. Without the attorney's warrant we will land in jaiI, not he. It is like in old times. We are suspecting each other. We'll smoke Snagov for another half a year. Later on, we will see... Father was militiaman in the harbour. I know what to do and when. What on earth, Stavros! The police saw you. To hell with them... They came to you for a bribe. Do you think, I didn't see? You were wrong not to do it... - Transportation was good? - Good! This was a superficial inspection... With a package of Kent, you can buy the commander as well. Listen, Dimos... I want 2% of the merchandise over the established amount... And... She is 14 years old. 300 dollars! - 14 years?! - Plus commission, 400! - Not cheap! But... - I know it is expensive, Stavros. I wouldn't pay that much even if I was to be impotent. But that's the price. - Not forged, Stavros? - No, Dimos. Room 8. He has high school. Beast! Beast! You are a cunning fellow! Nelu, you whistle once if someone comes, twice if it is the police! In the capital, with this time we land in 2 minutes in jaiI. You've lost half a minute. Enough! Put the things back. One more rehearsal. Here it is, nothing there, this one is winning. Open your eyes or pay. Put the money. You lost! - Pasca! - Yes? - Stop it, to avoid a scandal. - A scandal?! Who plays, who tries? Who wants to be a millionaire? How are things, guys? Did I change? Is my file getting thicker? - What's new, Ciugudean? - Who pays you? Four salaries for nothing... ... to observe two unemployed. - Pasca! - Are you playing smart? Leave him! Get lost! Tell us, Ciugudean, what about your promises? Everything will be okay... Look how the queue is getting bigger. You started really early. Shut up! Why should I, why? During Ceausescu's regime, he made a strike... And now he boasts... What's the big deal? Everybody strikes today. Keep your mouth shut, Gurita! - You can talk, but not work! - Is it you, who clocks me? - Here... - Beat him... - Go to hell! - I'll see more of you, Gurita... - Come back sometime! - Leave me alone. Wait a minute. There are two jobs as flayer. 100 lei f or a dog's skin, plus salary... - Leave me alone! - You'll starve, man! Fane, go back... This one is nervous. - I've got him! - It's shit you've got! Stay cool! Go to hell with your entire pack! - Come here. - You are mine! Be careful! Now! Go to hell! Why all the scandal? What are you doing here? Have you lost anything? Mother fucker... Go to hell! Drink with me, son, and see the piss I'm forced to drink. You promised to mother you'd drink only at home. Yes? What do we do with Pasca? Invite him to dinner? Aren't we enough? Where did you fall? You are full of dirt. If only I knew, that I would catch their dogs... ...I would have become party member, and kiss their ass. Keep lying... - What do you have there? - Money. - Where from? - I steal. - How comes, you steal? - I steal! You steal? Why do you steal? "The parliament will discuss today the report on the Stolojan government" "between October 1991- October 1992". "A short report on the spot... " - This is with sour bran! - Where is mother? - Queuing for potatoes. - Why didn't you go? If I had done it, you two would have quarrelled. Yes, you're right. Help me take my shoes off. Don't tell mother I've drunk. It is our secret... If I find out you steal, I'll tie your hands and legs and hang you. "... there was concrete referring to transition's costs, solutions... " The swine! He is a Senate member. "We want to emphasise that after presenting the report, many senators... " "asked questions to the prime minister and to the government's members. " "We inform you that after this news programme... " Easy! - What do I get? - I give you one hundred. This one has it, this one not, this one is winning. Watch the stoppers. Pay supreme attention. Who is joining the game? Who wants to play? Once again! This one has it, this one not, this one is winning. - This one! - Wrong! Do you play again? Here it is, nothing there, this one is winning. Who is joining the game? Who wants to pay? Here it is, nothing there, this one is winning. Who is joining the game? Who wants to pay? Pasca! Look at this bitch. I think it's got human brain. - Don't you see how it prays? - It doesn't, it judges us! "You skunks, you live because you are flaying us!" Do you really think it says that? I don't know exactly, but that has to be in its mind! Here it is, nothing there, this one is winning. Come on, Pascuta, try... handicraft is a golden bracelet... Here it is, nothing there, this one is winning. Who is joining the game? Who wants to pay? What are you doing, man? He released the dogs! There it is! Catch it! You pig! You don't give a damn. I have a wife and a kid! - Shut up, man! - All right! You don't care at all. The gipsy is human, too. Do you think I like what I do? I have a kid... Who tries again? Pay attention! Here it is, nothing there, this one is winning. - Is it this one? - It is! Pay! - Play! - For one hundred. - For one thousand! - One thousand. This one! Ciugudean! Pay a visit to Rotaru. - He has two welder jobs. - Where? - On the sea, on the Gloria platform. - Thanks! I'm sick even in a boat. Here it is, nothing there, this one is winning. Open your eyes widely! One, two, three, chose the one you want! You won! Take the money and get lost. - Play again! - I don't have money. - Show us all you have. - No more money. - How comes? - I don't have... - Let me see... - Let's go... Get lost! Go away. For you free of charge. You saved me four times. Look here! What do you say? You want to make love... Am I right? Dimos gives money to you. No, Mr. Dimos. I want her. This evening at 9. Dimos honest with you. She is not even 17. She is 19. She wants under age tariff. Yes, champagne, everything. As promised, for free. Okay? - What do you want, kid? - I'm looking for my brother Viorel. - Where does he work? - On the tower crane. Is it him people say about he's Rotaru's son? That's what people say... Even dad laughs about this rubbish. - Who is your dad? - Don't you know? Fane Ciugudeanu. All right! That's the crane. - How much, prick? - Six spare tyres and a cassette recorder. - Did you put them in the car? - Yes. We are finished here. If our neighbours catch us, they blow our house. Here, take them. You, too. Why do you pay Nelu the same amount? He was under the car and whistled. If he hadn't done it, you would be in jaiI by now. Don't you ever steal again. You are very stylish! Look at him! New shirt... ... up to date hairdo. The first time with girls, aren't you? Lover boy, get up! Courage! Come on! What did you think, this was a museum? Don't take your clothes off. Tough sensations! Here, dear boy, undressing is in the price. And in the pleasure! It is air-tight. You know... AIDS! All right. I'll send her right away! Show some guts, you paid, didn't you? Why are you doing this? For money? Because I don't feel anything! That's why! I'll kill Dimos! I'll destroy him! Why are you doing this? What's going on? Police! Police, stop the madman. He destroys my boat! I give everything, money, fresh stuff... Stop the madman! Stop the crane and come down! Captain lonescu is speaking. Stop the crane! Come down! Stop the crane! Don't you hear me, you fool? Come down, or I shoot! What happened, Vali? Where do you want to go? I took the exams. The last one wasn't that good; I'll make it elsewhere. You aren't going anywhere unless you tell me where you've been with this short skirt. - You'd better look after Viorel! - What's wrong with Viorel? He went mad! He destroyed Dimos' inn. The police arrested him. What? Don't worry about me. I'm going to Bucharest. Vali, Vali wait a minute! Viorel, what happened at Dimos'? It's settled with him. I'll help him with the boat. It's more difficult with the police. They claim 1.5 mill. F or damages. I'll get the money, dad. Viorel! Why did you do this? Father! Have you ever asked yourself... ...why has been everything going wrong in our family lately? - What do you mean? - You're drinking, Viorel is in jaiI... Vali run away, I don't go to school. Why aren't you going to school? Father... - Stop playing! - Are you the only one who's angry? I'll f ollow Vali! Viorel, I don't have neither the strength... ...to start again, nor the right partner. Maybe I was wrong. If at least you alone were wrong. But you deceived... ...what, do you think, got this wretch to take the flag from the city hall? Why do you call me a wretch? Viorel, for the last time, what did you have against Dimos? Ask Vali. Hi! Why didn't you want to work on the Gloria-platform? Take a seat! Who told you where I was supposed to work? That's not the point. Don't you look around you? Everyone finds his way out! How on earth do they? Only we missed the chances... After the revolution you said we would live better. We deserved more. If you go to the demonstration, it's over between us! Answer my question! I won't bring you food in jaiI and I won't visit you! Isn't it enough with Viorel? With Vali? - I've had enough, too! - Don't hit me! Shut up! Who has sent you to Rotaru? You've associated with that Pasca boozer... How will you get Viorel out of jaiI if you don't work? Wretch! You drunkard! There is great confusion at the shipyard. They want to fire 300 people. That's why they wanted to send us on the Gloria-platf orm. After firing us... now, that they panic, ...they remember you are the only person they fear. Fear? Don't you see they are doing what they want? Fane, in '87 you organised the strike, you were arrested... And now there is no way to get rid of them. Isn't it a pity? Do you want me to climb up, to be like Rotaru or Ifrim! I've sworn not to get involved anymore. Leave me alone! I've had enough. I promised to my wife. Leave me alone! Tomorrow I'll go find my boy. Wake up! Hurry up. Take it! I would like to tell you only one thing. Off with Ifrim! Off with Ifrim! We will see what the investigation commission decides. I don't have anything to hide. I've told the truth. - Listen to what Mr. Senator has to say. - Off with Ifrim! I want to announce the forming of a governmental commission... ...that will investigate the leadership's activity for the last two years. Ciugudeanu Viorel. Please. Take a seat, please! Viorel... Vali has sent money. I'll get you out from here. I don't need her money, mother. I've brought you some f ood. Keep it for yourselves. There is enough to eat here. - Please! - I don't want it! Mother... Do you think a brother can be jealous of his sister? What did Vali do for you to be jealous? For those who died here like stupid, for us, for nothing. Get lost, scamp! You've already stolen from me. Shame on you! Why doesn't the police arrest you... What are you doing? - Where is the food? - I didn't take it. Do you think we are not hungry? - Ugly guy! - Look at all your colleagues... Tell us, how is your mum? Is she pretty, is she hot? - Tell us! - She is pretty, she is hot. Please have a five man delegation, to come to my office to discuss... - Brothers! Be quiet! - Let's listen to what he has to say. Brothers, don't listen to them! They are telling you only lies! Colonel Rozorea, who inquired and beat me at the Security... ...is now a senate member. Don't let this instigator mislead you. I've seen him on television... He is making fun of us and our hopes. But he won't do that anymore! My profession taught me that half made welding is bad work... ...and must be done again. And don't tell me it isn't true. You will weld elsewhere! Brothers, don't listen! They are all lying! They are mocking us. Party secretaries are now in the senate, in the parliament. Get closer... closer! The Security has watched me for three years. Don't listen to them! The star is rising... Like a big mystery... The star is shining and telling the world, That today, the Holly Virgin, Gave birth to Messiah... ...in the famous country, called Bethlehem... The Three Magi saw the star... Don't let them come out! Murderers!
