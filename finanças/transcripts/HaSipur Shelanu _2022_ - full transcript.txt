Hi, Tai. -What's up, Liat? ﻿Barel, you gotta hear this singer I'm producing. ﻿Sure. -How should I send you the recording? ﻿Hi, Alma. ﻿Hey. He's been in the bathroom for an hour/ ﻿I know, you have to go now. -What? ﻿Zehavi's here, Israel Entertainment's leaker. ﻿If he asks if you're here with Shaked, say absolutely not. ﻿Is he ashamed of me? -How could anyone be ashamed of you, Alma? ﻿You're beautiful. ﻿Shaked has an irritable bowel and doesn't want everyone to know. ﻿He'll call you later. Excuse me. ﻿Incidentally, he's totally into you. ﻿Really? -Yeah. -Hi, Tai? ﻿Hey, sweetie. Can I pay here? Thanks.^ ﻿Sure. Did you see the clip I sent you? ﻿Of course, I'll tell my secretary to set up a meeting for us. -Thanks. ﻿Where have you been? I've been waiting here for an hour. ﻿What is that stuff? ﻿Shaked, why were you a no-show at the fundraiser? ﻿Because that Alma texted me. She's the one who wanted us to meet. ﻿And you saw her, bro. I'm only human. ﻿Zehavi had to come here of all places? ﻿Didn't you think ﻿that if you say you're sick and then show up at the hottest spot in town ﻿you may get caught? ﻿I'm such an idiot sometimes. ﻿I won't argue with you on that. ﻿Put this on and take this tray. ﻿I'll distract Zehavi. When you see he's not looking, ﻿run to the kitchen, Koby's waiting for you out the back door. ﻿It'll be okay. ﻿What's up, Zehavi? ﻿Oh, Barel, how's it going? ﻿I heard that Shaked Cohen no-showed at the fundraiser. ﻿No-showed? -Yeah. -Are you nuts? ﻿No? -Poor guy is at home with a fever. ﻿Bummer. -Yeah. -Can I quote you on that? ﻿Sure, man. ﻿Love you, man. -Liar. She won't kill me, will she? -She'll try, we'll calm her down. ﻿No offense, dude, but your mom scares me. ﻿It's okay, she scares me too. ﻿I can't feel my legs. Tell me I'm at the top. ﻿Tai, tell me I'm at the top. -You're at the top. ﻿Again, again. -You're at the top, bro. Roni. ﻿Fines won't interview Ben El. ﻿Tell him if there's no Ben El, there's no Static either. ﻿Oh, and Karen Peles is on my case. Set up a meeting, then cancel it. ﻿We already said last week that you have migraines. ﻿Shit. Okay, go for an irritable bowel. ﻿No one likes to ask about it. -Good idea. ﻿You know what? ﻿I think we're the only ones making a big deal out of it. ﻿No one will even write about it. ﻿Shaked Cohen No-Showed for a Fundraiser" ﻿Sharon honey, sorry about this, ﻿but you know what it's like when you're at the top... ﻿sometimes you stumble. But my hair looks great! ﻿But you're no longer at the top. ﻿Don't even joke about that. ﻿Do you see me laughing? ﻿Who no-shows at a children's fundraiser? ﻿They think you're snooty and don't care about anyone. ﻿Take care of it, it's starting to affect the agency. ﻿You gotta do something good, pronto. ﻿Me? I'm always doing good things. ﻿Like yesterday, I bought a croissant ﻿and it wasn't fresh. ﻿I didn't wanna embarrass the cashier, so I ate the whole thing. ﻿That's beautiful. ﻿Maybe something with at-risk youths. ﻿Didn't you go to some boarding school down south? ﻿No way, forget that trauma. ﻿That place is for abandoned kids. ﻿My mom dumped me there, I got kicked out, ﻿I didn't talk to her for two years, forget it. ﻿That's great, it's moving. ﻿Take some pictures with them, sing with them, show people Shaked Cohen's big heart, ﻿he didn't forget where he comes from. ﻿Tai, find me something else, ﻿I have my own red lines. ﻿You want Sharon to fire you? ﻿When do we leave? Miss! ﻿Good morning, miss. ﻿Miss, our lesson started half an hour ago. ﻿Shit! -One, two, three... ﻿You're far away, inside yourself ﻿You always wear the same mask ﻿You smile and say everything's okay ﻿Then the same thing the next day ﻿Everyone says you're always looking for fights ﻿You build me an unstable roof that falls apart in a second... ﻿Stop, she hates this. ﻿What? No, I don't hate it. ﻿It's a good song, ﻿but you're performing it with no emotion. ﻿Like you're totally disconnected from it. ﻿A song is supposed to be a window to your soul. ﻿I want to hear what you're feeling, ﻿what you're going through. ﻿And not only sob stories, ﻿which everyone here at the boarding school has. ﻿There are all kinds of emotions. ﻿Let's say... ﻿There's a girl here who's had a crush on Halel for two years. ﻿Miss! -What? I said "a girl." ﻿See any other girls here? ﻿Chill, you're not my type. ﻿Great. -Shut up, ugly. ﻿Anyway, you can't perform a song without being connected to it. ﻿Without feeling every lyric and note in your body. ﻿Otherwise, why make music? -Fine, then we won't. ﻿Ido was right, the music department sucks. ﻿He said that? Where is he anyway? ﻿Forget it, we're not starting all over again. ﻿Let's go hang out. -Yeah. -Hey! Sit down. ﻿That's the whole idea of a work process. ﻿It's not instant. ﻿Sometimes it takes me days, even weeks, ﻿to achieve something that I don't feel like puking on. ﻿But when it does happen ﻿and it does come out the way I want, ﻿it's amazing. ﻿I want you to feel that too. That's why I'm here. ﻿Okay, then why don't you play us one of your songs? ﻿Me? ﻿Because this isn't about me. ﻿You started talking about yourself. ﻿Where did you say Ido was? ﻿That's too bad, it was nice. ﻿Last time I see bottles in here. ﻿It's crap. ﻿Why didn't you come to the lesson? ﻿Because. ﻿Not a good enough answer. ﻿Yaakobi is onto you. ﻿He won't let me keep you here if... ﻿It doesn't matter, I'm leaving the music department. ﻿I know you don't like playing your music for people. ﻿You may be afraid of their reaction, and that's okay. ﻿But just so you know, ﻿I really want to hear it. ﻿Everyone does. -Then find something else to hear. ﻿Ido, it's not for us, it's for you. ﻿Please don't give up on yourself. ﻿Good, great conversation. ﻿Check this out, bro. ﻿I read that in the new version they're gonna add ﻿an overhead kick feature. ﻿Can you believe that, bro? ﻿I'm just a simple guy, ﻿give me a tiki-taka all the way to the goal area and pass it into the goal. ﻿Tiki-taka, are you kidding me? You be Barcelona ﻿and I'll be some lousy local team and I'll still beat your ass. ﻿You're a good agent, but a terrible player. -I heard ya. ﻿So I'll pick you guys up tomorrow night, right? ﻿Take good care of him. ﻿See you, guys. ﻿No, no, Koby, come here, buddy. ﻿I changed my mind, take me home. -What's with him? -I... ﻿Things at home were bad, but here they were worse. ﻿No one gives a damn about these kids. ﻿Take me home. -Shaked, that's why you're here. ﻿To give a shit. ﻿And so the whole country sees you giving a shit. ﻿I had anxiety attacks here, I cried all day, I don't wanna do this. ﻿Take me home. -Listen, guys. ﻿Tai said you're staying and I have my niece's wedding tonight, bless her soul. ﻿By the way, did you make the video I asked you to? ﻿Did you not hear me? ﻿I can't stay here! -Shaked... ﻿Congratulate Koby. -Congratulations. ﻿Thanks, that was moving. ﻿That's no way to congratulate someone. ﻿Your room is over there, room 9. ﻿I'll go look for the person in charge. ﻿Maayan Ben-Basat. ﻿What have you done to me? ﻿You turned my day into night... ﻿I swear, I should've been a singer. ﻿What is this? -Call the police! ﻿Are you nuts? Don't you know who that is? ﻿What have you done? ﻿Last time I opened the door to a stranger, ﻿he stole my wallet and your leopard earrings, so I thought... ﻿You'd hit Shaked Cohen's agent in the head with a frying pan. ﻿Oh, Shaked Cohen, I totally forgot about that. ﻿You're just making it worse! ﻿I'm not her friend, we just live together. We can't wait to meet Shaked. ﻿I even organized a party for you guys tomorrow. ﻿Okay... ﻿I nearly forgot, Maayan Ben-Basat, administrative director. ﻿Can I get some ice? ﻿Or do you two want to keep talking? ﻿Get some ice! ﻿Yeah, okay. ﻿I got everything that Shaked asked for. ﻿And he asked for a lot, bless his soul. ﻿I'll take it to him. ﻿Whoa, I'm so dizzy. ﻿You're not in any state to be carrying things, so... ﻿why don't I... ﻿bring it to him personally. -Fine, just be quiet. ﻿Yes! Thank you, God! ﻿I'm not happy you got hit in the head with a frying pan, God forbid. ﻿Okay, I'll go get everything organized. ﻿See you tomorrow at the party. ﻿Bye. ﻿Is this how you always greet guests? ﻿Only the ones who come to ruin my students ﻿with their three chords and bad lyrics. ﻿I'm starting to think the frying pan was intentional. ﻿No... ﻿You dropped something. ﻿It's all good, I'm okay. ﻿Hey, Shaked's in the bathroom. ﻿You can put that over there. Thanks. -Oh, okay. ﻿I thought I'd give it to him personally. ﻿Cool, so... ﻿there's Perrier, ﻿organic Egyptian sheets, ﻿80% bittersweet chocolate, ﻿a hot water bottle made of goat's wool. ﻿Sorry, sheep! Slippers, size 43,1 googled it. ﻿A blindfold, dried figs, patchouli incense, ﻿olive-oil liquid soap ﻿and a pineapple. ﻿And I have a surprise, ﻿wait... ﻿This is a personal gift from me. ﻿Chocolate cake, Maayan Ben-Basat style, ﻿okay? I may be the administrative director, ﻿but I also indulge in cooking. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Shaked Cohen is flushing the toilet. ﻿Hey... ﻿Maayan Ben-Basat, administrative director, ﻿huge fan and the woman you've been waiting for your whole life. ﻿Can I get a selfie? ﻿Yeah, sure. ﻿Do you have a phone? ﻿054-602... -No, babe, for the selfie. ﻿Oh, a phone... ﻿No, oh my god, shit, it's in my room! ﻿How can I not have my phone on the most important day of my life? ﻿I'll take your picture. ﻿A story for our children, huh? ﻿Ready? -Yeah. ﻿One, two, three... ﻿One more. One, two, three. ﻿Great. Got it. ﻿I'll send it to you. ﻿Thanks. -No problem. ﻿You're sure you have everything? -Yeah, we're all set. ﻿'Cause I can get whatever you need. ﻿I'm available. -We're good, thank you. ﻿Okay, I'll be going. -I think you should. ﻿I'm outta here. -You're out. ﻿Are you sure you don't... -Bye! -Bye. ﻿The shampoo here smells like camels, bro. ﻿I hope the boarding school does the trick ﻿because his antics are costing us too much. ﻿How's it going there? ﻿Tai? ﻿Tai honey? -What? ﻿Is he still acting like an unbearable little brat? ﻿He's absolutely impossible. ﻿I'll call you right back, okay? ﻿Simple, gentle songs... ﻿About love... ﻿Sorry, it's just me, no need for any pans. ﻿Is there something you need? ﻿No, no... ﻿That was beautiful, did you write it? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Go on, I didn't mean to interrupt. ﻿No, I have to go to sleep in any case. ﻿To sleep? ﻿At 8:40? What is this, a nursing home? ﻿No, I just... ﻿have a big day tomorrow. ﻿A celeb from Tel Aviv is coming to show an interest in my students. ﻿Hi, sorry. Anyway, ﻿the press will be here tomorrow, Shaked will come out looking good. ﻿He's back to his roots, working with underprivileged kids, ﻿heart of gold. ﻿It's all under control. ﻿No! ﻿What if it stays like this forever? ﻿Is this my new face? ﻿Shaked, well use this. ﻿"Despite being ill, Shaked Cohen came to have his picture taken with the kids." ﻿Have you lost your eyesight or what? ﻿Can't you see how I look? ﻿I got the message and... ﻿God help me! ﻿Maayan, what was in the cake you made? ﻿Like any cake, chocolate, oil, flour, sugar, eggs... ﻿and avocado. -Avocado? ﻿The texture is right and the flavor's very slight! ﻿My idea. -He's allergic to avocados. ﻿Okay. ﻿Why don't you reconsider? ﻿It's barely noticeable, you're so handsome! -Oh yeah? ﻿You turned me into a blowfish. ﻿No, you're not a blowfish! ﻿What's with the blowfish face? ﻿Shaked, we'll conceal it with makeup. ﻿I can conceal! ﻿I took a makeup course once. ﻿Koby, I need a buffer zone, she's scaring me. ﻿What's wrong? -I'm so sorry. ﻿But I know our relationship will survive this. ﻿What's going on? The kids are waiting. ﻿Shaked's allergic to avocado and he's leaving. ﻿You're allergic to avocado? -He's leaving? ﻿No one can see me like this. Let's go. -What? ﻿Listen, I apologize, ﻿but he's very self-conscious and won't have his picture taken like this. ﻿I don't get it, ﻿because your face is a little red, you're gonna disappoint my students ﻿who've been rehearsing for you? ﻿Who needs you? Get the hell outta here. ﻿We did just fine without you. ﻿Why can't Tai talk to them? ﻿Great idea! Tai will talk to them! ﻿Me? Wait. I'm not good with kids and... ﻿I'm just his agent, what... ﻿Shaked Cohen's agent. -She's right. ﻿I want to be back in your arms ﻿And write lyrics for you, from the heart ﻿Because in songs I can speak differently ﻿I can be open and free ﻿My heart is out, you say I'm not ready ﻿And inside I know that I can ﻿Climb the highest mountains ﻿Because with you I'm the strongest ﻿The strongest ﻿The strongest... ﻿She's crying again. ﻿Don't embarrass us, miss. ﻿Don't call me "miss," that was so good! ﻿It's exactly what I was talking about, you did a great job. ﻿Right? ﻿Yeah... ﻿He hates it. ﻿You want my opinion? -No, not really. ﻿I think it's nice, ﻿but nowadays / there's no audience for that. ﻿Who do you think you are, you snob? ﻿I knew this would happen. -Wait a second. ﻿We know how to handle criticism, right? ﻿What makes you say that? ﻿No offense, ﻿but I think because you live in the desert, ﻿no signal, weak wi-fi, ﻿you're not always informed about what's going on. ﻿That song would not make any serious playlist, ﻿definitely not YouTube's top trending. ﻿You can't just write songs for yourself and ignore ﻿what the audience wants to hear. ﻿That's why it won't work, period. ﻿Why do they have to think about what the audience wants to hear? It﻿'s their songs. ﻿They have to be loyal to who they are. ﻿That's the only thing they should focus on. ﻿Whatever you say, miss. ﻿What about you, man? ﻿Why aren't you taking part? You could be my savior. ﻿He doesn't play his stuff. ﻿You're answering for him? ﻿Why don't you play your stuff? ﻿Get off my case. ﻿What he does is meaningful, even if he doesn't share it. ﻿I have a question for you, ﻿If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does it make a sound? ﻿What's that got to do with it? ﻿What? -It's an old Chinese saying. ﻿What meaning does his stuff have ﻿if no one hears them? ﻿He's making it for himself. ﻿So yes, if a tree falls in a forest ﻿and no one hears it, it does make a sound, because the tree hears it. ﻿Itself. ﻿What's important is that he likes what he does ﻿and he doesn't care whether or not others do. ﻿Of course he cares. ﻿Who doesn't want to be loved? Don't you want to be loved? ﻿What's it got to do with me? ﻿It may be embarrassing to say in front of your students, ﻿but you want people to listen to you too. ﻿And if you have the guts, ﻿maybe one day you won't be playing to yoursel in the middle of the night ﻿with only a bench and two beetles that can hear you. ﻿I've had it with this bullshit. -Ido... ﻿I knew this was a mistake,-^ go bring him back. ﻿Me? -Yeah, you! ﻿He's not one of your celebs, he's a kid. ﻿Go! ﻿No need to yell. ﻿Who's allergic to avocado? ﻿I know people who are allergic to peanuts, almonds, ﻿kiwi, cow's milk, goat's milk, halva, ﻿kiwi... I already said kiwi. ﻿Avocado doesn't even have a flavor, ﻿it's a texture, how was I supposed to know? ﻿You think you're a plumber? ﻿Why won't you let me call a professional? ﻿So he'll break down the wall and rip us off? ﻿You can't trust anyone... -And always manage on your own. ﻿Your parents really did a number on you. ﻿No problem, you want to waste the boarding school's money? ﻿You're always saying there isn't any. ﻿True. ﻿Just today, the boarding school supervisor, what's his face? ﻿Shavit! He threatened to shut down all the departments ﻿that aren't computers and math. -What? ﻿Seriously? He wants to shut down the department? ﻿Yeah, but don't worry, I blocked him with my body. ﻿Since we're on the topic, ﻿is that what you're wearing to the party? -Is that what you're wearing to the party? ﻿I'm not going to the party. ﻿I want to finish reading my book. ﻿Oh my god, what's it about? Wait... Not interested! ﻿Am I supposed to stay home with you 'cause I'm a good friend? ﻿I'm not your friend. -Good, 'cause I really feel like dancing, ﻿partying, going wild. Bye, Grandma. ﻿Don't do anything I wouldn't do. Bye. ﻿I fixed the pipe! ﻿Shit! ﻿Maayan! Shit! ﻿Maayan! ﻿Hey! Miss. ﻿Don't call me... -You gotta see something. ﻿Okay, why am I here? ﻿Look. ﻿Aren't you totally shocked? ﻿Can you believe it? ﻿I gotta get back, problems at work. ﻿But hey, at least I won't be ruining your students anymore. ﻿I actually wanted to update... ﻿what I said about the tree falling in the forest. ﻿Okay. -First of all, I googled it, ﻿and it's not Chinese, it's Irish. ﻿So... -Thanks for the update. ﻿That's not the update, that's... ﻿a preliminary comment. ﻿The update is that... ﻿if you listen to the tree enough, ﻿you may be able to save it before it falls down. ﻿Then it doesn't have to fall down just to be heard. ﻿Anyway, I don't know what you did with Ido, but... ﻿it was cool. ﻿He was really happy. ﻿You know what a high it is when someone connects to something you created? ﻿You should try it sometime. Make yourself heard. ﻿Like, what I heard you singing... ﻿Oh, no, that was nothing. ﻿I can arrange a studio for you, ﻿record your material, ﻿maybe we'll do something with it. ﻿Studio? Wow, no way. ﻿Oh yeah, I forgot, ﻿you don't want to be loved. ﻿I'm loved. ﻿Here. ﻿Okay, so... ﻿Bye, miss. Sorry... ﻿Ori. ﻿Bye. ﻿And thanks. ﻿And sorry about the frying pan... Never mind. ﻿Let's dance real close into the night ﻿Let's love like there's no tomorrow ﻿Like in a dream, lift me up ﻿And set me back down with a kiss... ﻿Stop! -Cut! -What's wrong? -Benny. ﻿Come here! ﻿Everyone, stay where you are. ﻿What, sweetie? ﻿What's the deal with these dancers? ﻿Are you for real? ﻿It doesn't matter, they're just for decoration, ﻿everyone only looks at you. ﻿This clip has to be perfect, okay? ﻿Are you pinching pennies, Benny? ﻿Not cool. -Kim sweetie, ﻿trust me. ﻿By the way, you look amazing. ﻿The director is going nuts over you and the dancers ﻿and they'll only be seen for about five seconds max, ﻿trust me. ﻿So let's get back to work, okay? ﻿One day of shooting costs me a fortune. ﻿Come on, back to work, let's go! ﻿Get me two of those. ﻿Hi. ﻿Sorry to disturb you. ﻿I just wanted to introduce myself. ﻿I'm your new agent. ﻿I already have an agent, thanks. ﻿You still don't know that you left him? ﻿Nice to meet you, I'm Tai Barel. ﻿Sharon Barel's son? ﻿You deserve more than that Gabi. -Benny. ﻿I get everything I want from him. ﻿But not everything you need. ﻿And you know what I need? ﻿You need to be seen as who you really are. ﻿A super-fresh pop star who's here to stay. ﻿Even though you're only 19, ﻿you and your art should be taken seriously. ﻿Your agent thinks that because you're young, ﻿he can cut corners with you, ﻿but that's no way to build a star. ﻿No way to build a brand. ﻿Like I said... ﻿20 seconds ago, ﻿that's not what you need. ﻿What's up, guys? We're running 30 minutes late. ﻿What are you doing here, Barel? -What does it look like? ﻿I'm taking her away from you. -He's not taking me anywhere. ﻿You're used to this, aren't you? ﻿Getting whatever you want? ﻿To be honest, yes. ﻿Get outta here before I bust your face. -Whoa, ﻿let's not resort to violence. ﻿Kim, when you're ready, ﻿you know where to find me. ﻿There's something that's been bugging me, wait. ﻿That's it. ﻿Bye, Gabi. -Benny! ﻿She heard everything she had to hear. ﻿Yeah. ﻿Okay, see you in the morning. ﻿Bye. ﻿Miss? ﻿The Chinese tree. -Wow! ﻿I didn't know you knew the way to Tel Aviv. ﻿Neither did I, ﻿but Maayan is auditioning for "Champion Chef," so I tagged along. ﻿The same Maayan who put avocado in the cake? ﻿Yes. She just made stuffed cabbage with ground meat and marshmallows. ﻿And you didn't say anything? ﻿I thought you were her friend. ﻿I am, that's why I'm here, to support her. ﻿I made it to the next step! -What? ﻿Oh my god! -I mean... ﻿Of course you did. -Of course! ﻿Did they taste the dish? ﻿They loved it! Look, they ate it all up! ﻿They said it's unique and original and asked me back for a second audition! ﻿Wait, what are you doing here? ﻿I was on a set where they're shooting a clip. ﻿Shaked Cohen's? -No. ﻿Never mind, I'm not that into him anymore. ﻿You can tell him that. ﻿No way, it'll break him. ﻿Really? Did he say something about me? ﻿We need to go, our last bus leaves... ﻿It just left. ﻿Shit! ﻿If you need somewhere to stay tonight... ﻿you can come to my place. ﻿You'll have the whole living room to yourselves. ﻿No thanks, we'll manage. ﻿Manage? You wanna sleep on the street? Well come. ﻿After me. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Girlfriend, I ain't sleeping on the street. ﻿Sorry for not bringing my sleeping bag. -Maayan! ﻿Wow! ﻿This is exactly how I imagined a bachelor's pad in Tel Aviv. ﻿Yeah, it's... ﻿cozy. ﻿This is your bed for tonight. ﻿Where is the WC? ﻿The what? ﻿The bathroom, sweetie. -Oh. ﻿Over there, on the left. -Thanks. ﻿I'll go get some sheets. ﻿Thanks for the invitation. ﻿But we would've managed. ﻿How? ﻿She doesn't like when people hear her peeing. ﻿Oh boy. And you? ﻿I don't care. ﻿So you're embarrassed for people to hear your material ﻿but not hear you pee. ﻿Peeing isn't personal, everyone sounds the same. ﻿My material is... ﻿Wait, I'm looking for a metaphor that's unrelated to bodily fluids. ﻿I thought you were the delicate type. ﻿Very delicate. ﻿Do you regret inviting us? -A little. ﻿I'm afraid to find out you're a hairy man trapped in the body of someone who looks... ﻿not too bad. ﻿Well... have a good night. -Have a good night. ﻿Not much in there. ﻿This is the saddest fridge I've ever seen. ﻿I know, I got a call from the Fridge Protective Services. ﻿Can't fall asleep? ﻿How can I? It's like a freight train. ﻿Good thing we don't share a room at home. ﻿So what do you feel like eating? ﻿Wow! ﻿Deliveries at 2 a.m. ﻿I may be able to get used to that. ﻿What? ﻿Who eats pizza with a knife and fork? ﻿Oh, touching food grosses me out. ﻿I know, it's weird. ﻿It's more than weird, have you thought of seeing a doctor? ﻿It's because of my mom, she hated when I got dirty, ﻿so I'm used to it. ﻿Are you an only child? ﻿How did you know? -Duh. ﻿Dirt means germs and disease and she wouldn' let anything happen to her only child. ﻿Is she a single-parent? -How did you... ﻿We've know each other for two seconds. -Sorry, I do that sometimes. ﻿Here, take this. -What are you doing? ﻿Solving your issue, just touch it, it's nice and greasy. ﻿Ew! ﻿So what's it like growing up like a prince? ﻿Don't be like that. ﻿Listen, I have an amazing mom, ﻿she raised me on her own, built an empire with her own two hands, ﻿made sure I always had everything. ﻿She always said anything's possible, as long as we're together. ﻿Wow. -She taught me that this world ﻿is one big playground. ﻿It must be nice to feel that. ﻿What about you, how did you wind up at the boarding school? ﻿You look like a princess yourself. ﻿When I was 14, my family moved to Germany ﻿for my dad's job and I didn't get along there. ﻿But they didn't want to ruin things for Daddy, ﻿so they decided to send me home alone ﻿and they stayed there. ﻿Or maybe they just didn't love me. ﻿Alone, at 14? ﻿Yeah. I was supposed to live with my aunt, but... ﻿I didn't get along there either, so they sent me to a boarding school in Bat-Yam, ﻿a horrible place. ﻿I ended up at Neve Arava and the music department saved my life. ﻿Your parents are really messed up. -Yeah. ﻿Who wouldn't love you? ﻿You mean, who would love me. ﻿So you started playing music at the boarding school? ﻿Yeah, they were the first people who ever really noticed me. ﻿They let me play music and sing, do what I wanted to do. ﻿That's why I stayed on as a music teacher. ﻿If you love it that much, why don't you do anything with it? ﻿Why don't you record your songs and perform. ﻿I'm not good enough. ﻿Nonsense, who gave you that idea? ﻿Why do you think someone gave me that idea? ﻿It sounds like something someone told you, ﻿you believed it, and now you think it came from you. ﻿I impressed you. ﻿Don't get too excited. ﻿Too late, I'm excited. ﻿Who's the idiot? ﻿There was this music teacher at the boarding school in Bat-Yam, ﻿it took me years to work up the courage to play my songs for him, ﻿and when I finally did, ﻿he said I sounded like a million other girls. ﻿Oh, and that I have no grace. ﻿What kind of teacher says that to his student? ﻿He wanted to spare me the humiliation of failing. ﻿You are seriously wack. -What does wack mean? ﻿Since we're on the subject, ﻿I have a little confession. ﻿You're a serial killer and you keep all the bodies in your empty fridge? Worse. ﻿Remember that night at the boarding school when you were playing and... ﻿I saw you and you ran off like a little mouse? -Yeah. ﻿Well, you left behind a piece of paper with lyrics and chords. ﻿I took it. ﻿I was wondering where that disappeared to. ﻿Can I get it back? -No. ﻿But I promise no one will see it or touch it ﻿until you're ready to record your music. ﻿So you mean never, ever. ﻿Okay, great. ﻿Say. ﻿what was the name of that idiotic teacher of yours? ﻿Ran Peleg. Does that mean anything to you? ﻿Of course not. ﻿Does he still live in Bat-Yam? ﻿That's the apartment. ﻿Wanna ring his bell and run away? ﻿Good plan, aside from the fact that it's lame, ﻿so let's move ahead with my plan. ﻿Okay, what's the plan? ﻿If everything was just like in the movies... ﻿You're gonna wake everyone up! ﻿You would play and sing for me ﻿Simple songs... I don't remember the words... ﻿Come on! ﻿Simple, gentle songs ﻿About love ﻿And we'd never give up ﻿On our dreams... ﻿Ran Peleg, that's for you, and just so you know, Ori is a gifted artist! ﻿And I have grace! -And she has grace! ﻿Be quiet! Get outta here! ﻿Ran Peleg doesn't live here, he moved a year ago. ﻿Do you know where he lives? ﻿Run. ﻿Wait. ﻿You know how you can tell if a song's good? -How? ﻿When you sing it real loud in Bat-Yam in the middle of the night ﻿and it still moves you. ﻿True. -That's how we'll launch your album! ﻿A balcony tour. Gimme five! ﻿You're being ridiculous. ﻿What is this? ﻿Did you take a shower with your clothes on? ﻿No, someone... ﻿Never mind, it's a bizarre story. ﻿Yeah. -Go back to sleep. ﻿No, I'm good. Slept like a baby. ﻿Want me to make breakfast? -No. -No. ﻿Why aren't you touching your French toast? ﻿Oh, it's French toast? I... ﻿can't eat gluten. -Oh no. ﻿This is gluten-free. ﻿You gotta try it. ﻿Excellent choice. It's oatmeal with lots of goodies. ﻿Raisins, coconut, raisins, dates and black olives. ﻿I'm allergic to black olives. ﻿I'm okay with green ones, but black ones are... ﻿Taltul, I've been waiting for you for 15 minutes. ﻿Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know you had guests. ﻿So you forgot we were supposed to meet. ﻿Maayan, Ori, ﻿this is my mother Sharon. ﻿Hey. -On one hand, she has no boundaries, ﻿on the other hand, she has a key. ﻿Since when is there anything in this house besides water? ﻿Oh, it's all the work of my glorious hands. ﻿Thank you. -Wow, it looks delicious. -Yeah. ﻿Pile it up, these two hardly eat. ﻿She eats like a bird and he's allergic to black olives. ﻿Since when are you allergic to black olives? ﻿Just found out. ﻿That's why I had all the. ﻿You know Ori's a musician? ﻿I wouldn't say I'm a musician... ﻿A gifted musician. -Oh... ﻿Yeah, she sings, writes, plays, the works. ﻿Wanna hear her? ﻿You must have something more important to do. ﻿You don't have to... -She wants to hear. ﻿The only instrument I have here. ﻿Either you sing or I'll sing "Kumbaya," it's the only song I can play. ﻿Okay. ﻿She's amazing. Borderline genius. ﻿You said we should jump, so I held my breath ﻿I didn't think what would happen to me ﻿I feel safe with you ﻿And in my mind . I was already running aheaa I saw something promising ﻿I wasn't looking at the ground ﻿And suddenly it disappeared ﻿If everything was just like in the movies ﻿You'd sing and play for me ﻿Simple, gentle songs ﻿About love ﻿And we'd never give up ﻿On our dreams ﻿Of building a world out of lyrics ﻿And never be afraid of getting hurt ﻿Something like that. -My beautiful, talented angel. ﻿Mommy's genius I'm so proud of you. ﻿She's right up our alley. ﻿Are youthinking of turning this into a profession? ﻿Actually, I already have a profession, I'm a teacher. ﻿Well, if you change your mind, I can send you a contract. ﻿Me? A music contract? -No, Alfonso, ﻿my cousin in Argentina who makes alfajores sculptures. ﻿Send it and I'll sign on her behalf. -What do you have to lose? ﻿Nothing. ﻿Okay, yes, I mean, thank you. ﻿What just happened here? ﻿This is terrible! ﻿Texture-wise or too much salt and pepper? ﻿You were awesome, and right at the money-time. ﻿I hope it doesn't go to your head. -You think? ﻿I'm so nervous, I'm about to pass out. ﻿You know the Music Awards ceremony? ﻿It's tonight and lots of important people will be there ﻿who you should meet. ﻿What don't you come along? -Me? ﻿I don't know... ﻿And my students are waiting for us, so... ﻿You bet we're coming. ﻿Will Shaked Cohen be there? ﻿Of course. ﻿Good, so I'll text you all the info, ﻿and don't forget to lock the door when you leave. ﻿Ciao. ﻿Dear Lord in heaven! -What just happened here? ﻿You got a contract with the biggest agency in the country ﻿and you got invited to an evening out where anyone who's anyone will be there, ﻿not to mention that hunk who keeps hitting on you. ﻿You think? ﻿Most important thing - we need clothes, ﻿because I won't let Ivri Lider see me like this. ﻿Okay, I was thinking of a few ways of promoting Ori Golan... ﻿Look who's here to visit. ﻿You were right about Benny. ﻿I'm always right. ﻿I'm glad you decided to join us. ﻿I haven't decided yet. ﻿Don't get all smug, but... ﻿Kim is still contemplating which agency to move to, ﻿so she's here to get a feel of things. ﻿But let's talk about the really important stuff. ﻿Who are you going to the ceremony with? ﻿I was planning to go with Benny, but... ﻿Tai would love to take you. ﻿Actually... ﻿Should I pick you up at your place? ﻿How do you know where I live? -Don't insult me. th﻿at's my job. ﻿Then I'll see you tonight. ﻿Treat her like a Saudi princess tonight. ﻿I want her to wake up tomorrow morning ﻿feeling like if she doesn't move to our office ﻿it'll be the biggest mistake of her life. -Okay. ﻿About Ori. -Who? ﻿Oh, Ori, yeah. What about her? ﻿I want to record some of her material with her. ﻿Taltul, she's not right for us. ﻿What do you mean? ﻿I'm not saying she's not sweet, ﻿but for a club with twenty people max, ﻿she'll never fill auditoriums. ﻿It's not like you to get confused. ﻿Then why did we send her a contract? ﻿Did you expect me to say that to her face? ﻿I saw that you... ﻿Amazing work with Kim, focus on that. ﻿Oh my god, I love Stephan. ﻿My food is a thousand times better. ﻿Taste it. -No, I have no appetite. ﻿Where is he? ﻿Oh, there's my prince! ﻿Hello, Shaked Cohen. ﻿Remember me? ﻿Avocado cake... ﻿Allergy, blowfish... ﻿Get away from me, ASAP. ﻿I'm about to get best male singer, I don't even want ﻿to smell your food, it may mess up my face again. ﻿FYI, or your information, some people love my food. ﻿I got into "Champion Chef." ﻿You? No way. ﻿Oh yeah? They asked me to come for a second audition. ﻿Koby... They're just messing with you. ﻿I'm onto you. ﻿You know we're gonna be together, it's written in the stars. ﻿But you're afraid ﻿that I'll upstage you when I win "Champion Chef," ﻿'cause I'm gonna win "Champion Chef," and you don't wanna be a power couple. ﻿You want to be the only star in this relationship, I get that. ﻿You really are deranged, huh? ﻿Let's just go home. ﻿No, we're talking. -No, wait, ﻿I'll check with someone I used to go out with, ﻿gimme the phone. ﻿Fine by me, I'm not the jealous type. ﻿She's on the production team, she'll know what's going on. ﻿On one of the episodes, they made that pie. ﻿Did you see it? -Yeah. ﻿It was one of the best. -I wanted to jump into the TV set ﻿and scarf it down. -Ask her, ﻿I like the orange jacket. -Killer, huh? ﻿Maya? -I love Maya. ﻿I think Maya knows me too. ﻿How's it going, baby? ﻿I'm just at the Music Awards ceremony, I'll probaly get best male singer ﻿But I don't want to jinx it. ﻿You'll win in any case. ﻿Listen, I want you to check on one of your contestants, ﻿on Champion Chef, her name's Revital. -Maayan. ﻿Maayan, Maayan. ﻿Ben-Basat. -Ben-Basat. ﻿No way, she's just a friend. ﻿For now! ﻿Oh yeah? -Yeah. ﻿Okay, Maya. -Okay, Maya! ﻿Thanks. ﻿What did she say? -Well? ﻿Forget it, babe, it's all good. ﻿Of course it's all good. I told you. ﻿What's going on? ﻿Are you familiar with the term "comic relief"? ﻿Yeah, it's when they let people audition just to make fun of them afterwards, right? ﻿Those are the best parts. ﻿Oh... -Awkward situation. ﻿Sorry, babe. ﻿It's their loss. ﻿Maybe they're right. -Hey! ﻿You're a creative chef. ﻿Okay? And you bring yourself. ﻿If they can't see that, then it's their... ﻿What? ﻿Kim, Kim! ﻿Kim, over here! -You're beautiful, Kim! -How are you? ﻿Over here! -Kim, are you gonna win tonight? ﻿Give us a smile. ﻿You know it's all business with her, right? ﻿Kim, over here! ﻿Whose dress are you wearing? ﻿Kim, they say you're gonna win best female singer. ﻿What do you think? ﻿Don't jinx it. Thanks. ﻿I see your agent isn't with you. ﻿Actually, he is. ﻿I'd like you to meet my new agent, Tai Barel. ﻿When was this decided? ﻿Right now. ﻿Business. ﻿Where are you going? -Excuse me. ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Hey! ﻿Six, seven, go. ﻿Your hands electrify me ﻿Gimme a kiss ﻿You ain't for real ﻿Stop, stop. ﻿I'm sorry, but I can't do this anymore, Tai. ﻿Talk to me, what's going on? ﻿I'm sick of singing songs I can't relate to. ﻿It used to be okay, but... ﻿I can't do it anymore, it's not me. ﻿Okay. ﻿Then what do you want? ﻿To choose my own material, ﻿my own clothes, what I say. ﻿I don't want to be someone else's brand. ﻿Is that stupid? ﻿No. ﻿If it bothers you, ﻿it's a good sign. ﻿It's a sign that there are other things inside you that want to come out. ﻿Now we just have to figure out what they are. ﻿You're my knight in shining armor -Don't. Go on. ﻿My hot-cocoa knight. ﻿That motherf***er, ﻿he still sings off-key even with all that auto-tune, ﻿that f***ing loser. ﻿Not here. -Who does he think he is? -Not here, in the car. ﻿This is the fifth item this week. ﻿I thought it would blow over, but it's like a car wreck. ﻿People can't stop looking at it. ﻿He thought he was gonna win best male singer. ﻿Oh yeah? And I thought we were working with an adult, ﻿not a baby. ﻿So he's disappointed, he should learn how to behave. ﻿Why do I have to waste all this time on damage control? ﻿Again! ﻿Speaking of babies, what's the story with Kim? ﻿She doesn't want to be a brand name? She's Kim. ﻿She's supposed to be a brand name. ﻿hope you talked her out of it. ﻿I told her we'd find different material for her. ﻿What does she think she is, a folk singer? ﻿Next thing you know she'll have political opinions. ﻿I'm on it, okay? ﻿Here she is, my beautiful winner! ﻿How are you? ﻿Much better. -Good. ﻿Sweetie, I heard you don't like the new song, ﻿and I'm very happy you say what you think, ﻿but did you see all the platinum records out in the hall? ﻿All those people achieved what they achieved by listening to me. ﻿To us. Believe me, we know what we're doing. ﻿And I have to tell you one more thing ﻿about that "perfect song." ﻿It doesn't really exist. What you need... -Actually, I found it. ﻿It was in your drawer, I was looking for a tissue, not snooping around, and... ﻿Okay. ﻿"If everything was just like in the movies ﻿"You'd play and sing for me ﻿"Simple, gentle songs about love ﻿And we'll never give up on our dreams ﻿"Of building a world out of lyrics ﻿"And never being afraid of getting hurt..." ﻿This is it, it's exactly what I was looking for, ﻿it's real and emotional and beautiful. ﻿It's the new Kim. ﻿Great, then we're all set. ﻿We're all set. I'll tell Sergei to write similar. ﻿No, I don't want something similar. ﻿I want this. ﻿Unfortunately, that's impossible ﻿because the songwriter won't let anyone use it. ﻿Who is she? Let me talk to her, I'll make it work. ﻿It's Ori, the girl you met at my place, remember? ﻿Wait, she signed with us. ﻿All the rights to her songs our ours. ﻿Kim honey, this is yours. ﻿You can start rehearsing today, as far as we're concerned. ﻿Right, Tai? ﻿Robertson... ﻿And the ball is stopped by the goalie. ﻿Are you letting me win on purpose? The goal was wide open. ﻿I accidentally pressed "pass." ﻿You take all the fun out of beating your ass. ﻿Now Alexander-Arnold... And it worked! ﻿But it's not going anywhere. ﻿Do you ever feel you're not where you're supposed to be? ﻿Sure, bro, I always go in from the middle, instead of the sides, ﻿then the defense closes in on me and kills me. ﻿I didn't mean that, man, I meant in real life. ﻿It's like, you take a certain path, but... ﻿you don't know if you're heading in the right direction. ﻿A kind of emptiness. ﻿Of course, bro, who doesn't? ﻿Then I pig out on falafel ﻿and no more emptiness, all gone. ﻿You pea brain. ﻿Just kidding, bro, I know what you're talking about. ﻿Maybe that's why I keep getting into trouble. ﻿Really? ﻿Does it help? ﻿You know what helps me the most? -What? ﻿Scoring a 20-meter volley goal against you. ﻿Check this out, bro! ﻿Yahoo! Yippee! ﻿Look how great this is, all the atmosphere... ﻿Everyone's ecstatic, check this out! ﻿Now you'll see all the cheerleaders coming... ﻿I just scored a goal, that's why... ﻿I'll take away your key if you don't know how to knock. ﻿You didn't answer my messages. ﻿Can we have a moment, Shaked? ﻿Sure, I was just about to take a shower. ﻿Don't you dare touch my towel, Shaked. ﻿Take a new one from the cupboard. ﻿No way, I'm taking yours. ﻿I love the way you smell, Daddy. ﻿Crazy... ﻿You haven't come to work in two days. ﻿So? ﻿Are you mad at me? Because of that friend of yours? ﻿Your sensitivity is your biggest gift. ﻿I used to be like you. ﻿I wanted to discover new artists, help them express themselves, ﻿even if it wasn't lucrative. ﻿You wanted to discover artists? ﻿Next thing you'll be telling me you're a hospital volunteer. ﻿Look where you live. ﻿How you live. ﻿How many people your age can afford a place like this? ﻿A job like this? ﻿It's thanks to stars like Kim ﻿I separate between business and life. ﻿And life for me is you. ﻿And you know what makes me the happiest? ﻿Enabling you to make your dreams come true. ﻿Isn't it amazing to give someone that possibility? ﻿Wow, you're killing me here. ﻿Give your mom a hug, are you nuts? ﻿One more minute of privacy, sweetie, okay? ﻿Sure, no problem... ﻿You're just like me. ﻿You could've done anything you wanted and you chose to work with me, ﻿my way, and I'm so proud of you for that. ﻿Oh yeah? With an emphasis on "your way." ﻿That song means so much to Ori ﻿and I promised to help her produce it. ﻿Does she want you to help her produce it? ﻿Not yet, but she will. ﻿Okay. Well think about what we can do. ﻿Meanwhile, the most popular singer in the country wants it. ﻿It'll be a good thing for Ori too, think about it. ﻿After the song turns into a huge hit, ﻿everyone will want her to write songs for them. ﻿All right. ﻿But I want to be the one to tell her. ﻿So don't publish anything until I talk to her, okay? ﻿I promise. ﻿Shaked, I can see you. ﻿No, I just dropped something... ﻿Come on, where is it? ﻿Which outfit is nicer, this or this? ﻿I feel like there's no good way of answering that question. ﻿Because they're both gorgeous, right? ﻿Okay, intuition. ﻿This one. Sorry, babe. ﻿You have no idea who I'm going out with. ﻿Shakedush Cohenush. -Gimme a break. ﻿I'm serious. ﻿Maayan... ﻿I understand your skepticism, ﻿I thought it was hopeless at first too, ﻿so I wrote to him from a fake profile, butthen I realized ﻿that I am who I am and I worked up the courage ﻿and I wrote to him directly and we've been in contact ever since. ﻿You and Shaked Cohen are in contact? ﻿Daily. ﻿Maayani, listen, I... ﻿I'm getting a little worried. ﻿That what? ﻿That I'm nuts? ﻿No, no nuts, but that you have a very rich inner world ﻿and sometimes the lines ﻿get a little blurred, between the truth... ﻿and your imagination. ﻿In other words, that I'm nuts. ﻿Youthink I'm nuts. -No, okay, ﻿I promised my students I'd write them a song ﻿and you have "a date" ﻿so... -So... play your guitar! ﻿Who's keeping you? ﻿She thinks I'm nuts! ﻿I believe you, you're not nuts. ﻿That's nice to know. What are you doing here? ﻿You didn't answer my messages, ﻿so I came. ﻿Yeah, I've been really busy, etc. ﻿Etc.? ﻿You don't even feel the need making excuses, huh? ﻿I'm sorry about that evening, ﻿that I couldn't be with you. ﻿That whole circus with Shaked and... ﻿Kim. ﻿Fine. ﻿Forgive me? ﻿For what? I didn't expect anything from you, it's all good. ﻿It was 100% professional. ﻿So it was a professional kiss? ﻿Exactly. ﻿I'm here because... ﻿Kim didn't like ﻿a certain song that... ﻿Never mind... ﻿and... ﻿I thought... ﻿We thought that it would be... ﻿Wanna go for a walk? ﻿I wish I could live here, in all this beauty. ﻿You wouldn't survive for a second. ﻿Why? -Why? ﻿You have to live where people you admire live. ﻿And you eat pizza with a knife and fork. ﻿What's wrong with eating pizza with a knife and fork? ﻿Oh, and next to the definition of workaholic in the dictionary, there's a picture of you. ﻿You're wrong, ﻿there's a picture of my mom. ﻿Admit that you love being an agent, ﻿being written about, being surrounded by celebs. ﻿Yeah, it's fun, ﻿but maybe I'd choose my artists differently. ﻿Take Kim, not that there's anything wrong with her, but... ﻿I don't know if I'd choose to work with her. ﻿But don't quote me, ﻿'cause I'll deny it and sue you. -Oh my god. ﻿Then why don't you work the way you want? ﻿Because our agency has a very specific goal. ﻿Let me guess, helping the needy. ﻿Close. -Oh, making money, that was my second guess. ﻿Yes, it's okay to make money from music. ﻿Up until recently, I thought that's all I want. ﻿What happened? ﻿Are you familiar with the Tapinoma ant? ﻿What? ﻿This is its nest. ﻿It can tell you where the north is. ﻿What? -Yeah. ﻿They build it facing the south in the winter ﻿so that the sunlight that reaches it will make the eggs hatch faster. ﻿Wow! -You should get lost in the winter ﻿because I have no idea how they build it in the summer. ﻿I'll remember that. -I know a million trivia facts. ﻿I was the king of trivia up until 4th grade. ﻿Then I had my 9th birthday. ﻿What happened then? ﻿I planned a big trivia party for my class, ﻿I worked on it for weeks, even months. ﻿I sat for hours, choosing quizzes, ﻿preparing cards. -Wow, how did it turn out? ﻿It didn't. ﻿My mom was afraid no one would come to her geeky son's party, ﻿so she brought Svika Pick to perform instead ﻿and 200 kids showed up from the entire grade, ﻿they say it was the coolest birthday party ever. Wow, was it cool for you too? ﻿Listen, everyone was going nuts... -Forget everyone, ﻿it sounds like you wanted something else ﻿and your mom didn't understand you, ﻿what's important to you. ﻿That thing you do sometimes... ﻿I did it again, I'm sorry, I'll keep quiet. ﻿Let's both keep quiet. -Okay. ﻿It's fun to be quiet. ﻿Do you know there are wind scorpions around here? -Really? ﻿Yeah, the big ones ﻿can reach up to 7 cm. ﻿They eat reptiles, birds and rodents. ﻿Is that from the trivia too? ﻿King of trivia. Wow, how come you can't see the stars in the city? ﻿Because of the lights. ﻿You're right. ﻿You get home, turn on the TV, put on some music, ﻿so you won't be alone with yourself in the dark for one moment. ﻿So you won't hear your soul. ﻿Can you hear your soul? ﻿She won't shut up. ﻿What does she sound like? ﻿Like this! ﻿That was funny, surprising. -Thanks. ﻿What is she telling you? ﻿She's warning me about you. ﻿About me? Why? ﻿Forget it, everyone looks dangerous to her. ﻿Maybe she should keep quiet this time. ﻿I wonder what star that is. ﻿That one? -Yeah. ﻿That's the galactic hyperslootza. ﻿The galactic... -Hyperslootza. ﻿Exactly 32 degrees above the northern horizon ﻿Hold on. ﻿You're not actually googling that, are you? ﻿Google? Of course not. ﻿You are googling it! -Hey! ﻿Give me back my phone. -Oh, here's your history. ﻿Excuse me... -Can you grow after the age of 21 ? ﻿That's for work, thank you. ﻿If it's worth anything, I think your height is perfect. ﻿Hey, give me that! ﻿Now it's my turn! -Give me my phone! ﻿Not until I check something. ﻿How do you play the chord F sharp, Em5... Have you no dark sides? ﻿No, now give it back. -Wait, let me find the juicy stuff. ﻿Here we go, Kim's Instagram account. -Give it back. ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿So... ﻿are you interested in me? ﻿No. ﻿I'm interested in Kim. ﻿Don't let it go to your head. ﻿If it makes any difference... ﻿I've been thinking a lot about you too. ﻿Are you saying that to make me feel better? ﻿Yes. ﻿That too. ﻿I wanted to tell you something. ﻿Something important. ﻿That's why I came here today. ﻿Why is he looking at me like that? ﻿Relax, it's a camel, they roam around here. ﻿I don't trust camels, they're unpredictable. ﻿Is that from the trivia too? ﻿No, gut feeling. ﻿He's plotting something. -He's just a camel, all he wants is some love. ﻿Hey, camel! ﻿Run! Run! ﻿Quiet! That's the fastest camel in the world. ﻿There he is! ﻿Wants love, my ass. ﻿Wants love... ﻿You're crazy! ﻿Wow... ﻿I have an update. -Yeah? ﻿Maybe you are cut out to live out here, in the nature. ﻿only accept at-risk youths. ﻿You're at-risk too. ﻿But you still have a chance of coming out normal. ﻿You know you're very beautiful? ﻿And that you talk a lot? ﻿You know that when you're asleep, you breathe real fast, like a baby? ﻿Were you staring at me all night? ﻿I was guarding you in case the camel came back. ﻿Can I ask you something? ﻿Where can we get some coffee around here? ﻿Hi. Remember Tai Barel? ﻿I'm not hungry, in case you were planning on cooking. ﻿There's something you need to see. ﻿What is it? ﻿...everything was just like in the movies ﻿You'd play and sing for me ﻿Simple, gentle son- ﻿That's what I was trying to tell you. ﻿How did she get it? ﻿She found it in a drawer in my office, ﻿accidentally, and there was a problem, because... ﻿you signed the contract and... ﻿Never mind. I'm sorry you found out like this. ﻿It's not right, but there's a good side to it too. ﻿Okay? It's good because it's going to be a huge hit ﻿and you'll get lots of royalties ﻿and then when you want to start recording... -Get out of here. ﻿Ori... -What kind of person are you? ﻿How could you look me in the eyes and lie? ﻿You're a phony. ﻿You'd sell anything and anyone just to please your mom. ﻿Ori, it's not like that. ﻿I didn't want her to... -Keep telling yourself stories. ﻿But the person you are inside... Look at me! ﻿Who you really are, ﻿the nature of you, ﻿makes me sick. ﻿Tai, your mother wants to see you, it's urgent. ﻿What is this? -Just a little party for the new partner in the agency. ﻿Tai Barel, your time has come. ﻿Congratulations, Taltul! ﻿Tai. ﻿You're the man, you're the bomb! ﻿You're the greatest, TaL ﻿Kim sent you something. ﻿To my number one agent, congratulations. ﻿You really deserve this, I'm sending you a big virtual kiss, ﻿you'll get a real kiss at my concert, ﻿so you better show up, okay? ﻿Kirn's song reached first place with 20 million views. ﻿Isn't it time to thank the person who's responsible for that? ﻿It's you, all you! ﻿Hey, partner. ﻿Having fun? ﻿Yeah, of course. -I started worrying. ﻿We're getting rid of him tomorrow. ﻿What? -The whole office was working all week ﻿to fix the nonsense that came out of his mouth on that talk show. ﻿Can you imagine what would've happened if it had been aired? ﻿And after the embarrassment at the ceremony, no less. ﻿Hey! You guys make me feel so emotional. ﻿Hey, gorgeous, give me a hug. ﻿Sharon, I'm so sorry about the interview yesterday. ﻿Forget it, we're family. -Of course we are. ﻿I promise to get a grip of myself, ﻿I'm gonna change, be more serious. ﻿I have a new girlfriend, she's helping me become a better person. ﻿Did I tell you I'm in love? ﻿The kid's in love. -Yeah, she's so smart. ﻿Wise. -Amazing. ﻿She says I'm always doing stupid stuff 'cause I'm afraid ﻿that if I don't, no one will remember me. ﻿She's right, she's right. ﻿But enough about me, ﻿how about saying a few words to the masses? ﻿Nah. -Speech. ﻿Just a few words. Hey, everybody. ﻿Speech! Speech! Speech! ﻿First of all, thank you all for coming. ﻿I love you, really. ﻿Sometimes. ﻿And Sharon, I want to thank you for this opportunity ﻿and for everything you do for me, I really appreciate it. ﻿And... ﻿I quit. ﻿Funny guy. -He quits... -You're hilarious. ﻿I'm serious. ﻿I can't be a part of this agency anymore. ﻿There's no doubt that it's number one. ﻿But it's yours, Sharon. ﻿And as long as I'm here, ﻿I'll do everything to please you, ﻿to make you happy, but... ﻿I don't know... ﻿what will make me happy. ﻿Because you taught me everything. ﻿Everything I know. ﻿But not even you can teach me who I am. ﻿I have to find out for myself. ﻿We heard noises and then we saw that the pipe burst. ﻿It's fixable... right? ﻿I don't think so. ﻿Ido, go out and turn off the water. ﻿Ori. ﻿What happened? ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿I came to talk to you. ﻿This isn't a good time. ﻿I can see that. ﻿When will be a good time? ﻿Never. ﻿I quit. ﻿I want to turn over a new leaf, open my own agency, with you. ﻿I'll help you record your songs and... ﻿overcome whatever it is that you're afraid of. ﻿And I'll show you that the world isn't that bad. ﻿I left everything and came here first thing ﻿to talk to you. -That's too bad. ﻿Ori, I know that the people who were supposed to protect you... ﻿let you down. ﻿And so did I. ﻿And it'll be hard for you to trust me. ﻿But I believe that over time ﻿and with lots of work, we'll succeed. ﻿This has to be fixable. ﻿I believe you that you really want to change, ﻿but you can't. ﻿And my mistake was that I thought for a moment that you could. ﻿So go back to your life ﻿and let me move on with mine. ﻿You know what? I was wrong about you. ﻿I thought you were shy, ﻿but you're just a coward. ﻿You know you're a good singer, ﻿you know you have great material. ﻿You know that deep down inside you want it. ﻿But you won't do anything about it. ﻿You pretend everything's cool and you don't care what anyone thinks, ﻿but all you think about ﻿is how people perceive you, right? ﻿Otherwise you would've done something with your songs a long time ago! ﻿What are you afraid of? ﻿Huh? ﻿I'm really sorry about what I did to you. ﻿Really, ﻿I have no excuses. ﻿But I'm here now ﻿to invite you to come with me ﻿and try to make our dreams come true together. ﻿All you have to do is come with me. ﻿Maybe it has nothing to do with music and you just don't want to come with me. ﻿I understand. ﻿I just spoke with Yaakobi. -What did he say? ﻿When will they fix it? ﻿Never. -What do you mean, never? Where will we make music? ﻿You won't, they're closing down the music department. ﻿What? ﻿It's not his fault, it's Shavit from the Education Ministry. ﻿He thinks we only need departments for computers and math. ﻿Yaakobi tried talking with him, but it's no use. ﻿He doesn't want to pay for anyone's hobby. ﻿Hobby? ﻿He thinks music isn't important, ﻿he thinks it's a hobby. ﻿I see. ﻿Forget that, let's go. ﻿Where to? -The guy in charge at the ducation Ministry who wants to close us dow ﻿He thinks music isn't important. ﻿I need you there with me, so he can see the faces behind his budget charts ﻿and hear from you personally just how wrong he is. ﻿Well? ﻿Maybe we don't need a music department, miss. ﻿What are you talking about? ﻿It won't lead us anywhere. ﻿What we learn from you is that playing for ourselves ﻿is the most we can dream of. ﻿So what's the use? We don't want... ﻿to be like you. ﻿What's wrong with me? -You're stuck in this dump, ﻿as if it's the only safe place in the world. ﻿You're afraid of going anywhere. ﻿You had the chance to record, to perform, you said no. ﻿Even that song that they took from you, ﻿it could've been your breakthrough. ﻿So if we never go anywhere and sing to ourselves, ﻿we'd be better off doing computers, right? At least we'd be going somewhere. ﻿What are you doing? -I want to talk to that Shavit guy. ﻿It's in Tel Aviv, I don't know if the car will make it there, ﻿it hasn't moved in three months. ﻿Darn! -Enough. ﻿Why don't we just go home? ﻿We'll think things over, I'll make you something yummy. ﻿Pump the gas pedal, miss. ﻿Put it into second gear and keep your foot on the clutch. ﻿One, two, three! ﻿It's not... ﻿A little more. -We have to see where that idiot is. ﻿Who? -Shavit, who else? ﻿Let's say we make it to Tel Aviv, ﻿where will we find him? ﻿I didn't think of that. ﻿Here we go, boarding school division, his secretary, Sarit. ﻿A little more... -Quiet, guys, I'm talking to Tel Aviv! ﻿Come on. ﻿What changed your minds? ﻿You think we'd let you do this on your own? ﻿Besides, I hate computers. ﻿What have you done to me, you turned my day into night... ﻿Hello? -Hi, Sarit? -Yes. ﻿Hi, this is Maayan Ben-Basat, Neve Arava's administrative director. ﻿I'm on my way to you and need an urgent appointment with Mr. Shavit. ﻿I'm sorry, it doesn't work like that, ﻿send a fax with your request and we'll see when he has time. ﻿We don't have time for that, this is urgent. ﻿We only need ten minutes with him. ﻿Even if I wanted to help you, I couldn't. He's not here today. ﻿Then tell us where he is, we'll go wherever it takes. ﻿It's personal. ﻿Thank you for calling the boarding school division. ﻿Hey, Sarita! ﻿You like Shaked Cohen, don't you? -What? ﻿Yes, of course. ﻿You know I know him personally? ﻿I'm talking real personal. ﻿Never mind.

It's so great to meet you. ﻿Your song is perfect. ﻿It changed my life. ﻿I wish there was some way I could pay you back. ﻿Actually, there is something. ﻿Kim, is it okay if we go on after your song... ﻿What's going on here? ﻿You can't talk to her in the middle of a concert. ﻿Go change clothes. ﻿Bye. -Who let you in here, Shaked? ﻿No one. ﻿But Sharon my students need to go on stage ﻿and sing a little something. -They what? ﻿I know it sounds strange, but... ﻿they want to close down our music department ﻿and the guy who wants to do that ﻿is in the audience. ﻿The only way he'll realize he's wrong is if he sees and hears them. ﻿So is it okay if they go on for a moment after this song? ﻿Or whenever you say, we just need three minutes, please. ﻿I can't believe I'm hearing this. ﻿Get out of here, this area is off limits. ﻿Let them go on. ﻿My client is performing, you're way out of line. -Mom. ﻿You told me that the thing that mattered to you the most ﻿was helping other people make their dreams come true. ﻿And you always did that for me, the best that you could. ﻿But now they need this opportunity ﻿and you have the power to help them. ﻿So please, do the right thing. ﻿Let them go on, Mom. Go. ﻿You don't have much time. ﻿I want you to sing the new song you worked on this week. ﻿Are you sure? It's not ready. ﻿It's an amazing song, okay? Do you have the project on the computer? ﻿Yeah, but... -No but's. ﻿You'll be great, I'm the one who ruined you. ﻿My fears made you believe ﻿that only people at the boarding school could listen to you. ﻿But I was wrong. ﻿There's a whole world outside with lots of opportunities ﻿and you're just as worthy as anyone else. ﻿So go out there ﻿and prove to me that I didn't ruin you completely. ﻿No, not without you. ﻿We want you to sing it. ﻿What? No way. -We're not going without you. ﻿I know you think you can't do it on your own, ﻿but that's not true. -It's not for us. ﻿It's for you. You're the best singer we know. ﻿"Don't give up on yourself," you know. ﻿Hello, everyone. ﻿Kim... ﻿Hello. ﻿Kim will be right back, don't worry. ﻿Okay. ﻿My name is Ori Golan, ﻿I'm a music teacher at Neve Arava boarding school. ﻿You've probably never heard of it, ﻿but it's very beautiful. ﻿It's near the Dead Sea. ﻿The northern part... ﻿Only 10 km away from Jerusalem if you take.,.. ﻿Never mind. ﻿Put on Waze. ﻿Mr. Avner Shavit from the Education Ministry is here in the audience today. ﻿Mr. Shavit decided to close down our department, ﻿which is my students' home, and mine. ﻿So with your permission, ﻿we're here to sing for him, and for you, ﻿a song that they wrote, ﻿hoping that it'll make him understand how important this department is. ﻿And why music is just as important as computers. We hope you enjoy it. ﻿It's a crazy world and it's not always easy ﻿To fight for who I am ﻿To know what's real, between you and me ﻿To believe in love. ﻿It's a crazy world and it's not always easy ﻿To deal with every question ﻿To take a heart that's been wounded and help nurse it to health ﻿To believe in love. ﻿Even if it's darkk\ and there's nothing to light my way ﻿Even if I fell in front of a million people ﻿What matters is that I didn't give up ﻿Let's go all the way with our hearts and come out winners ﻿Winners, we are winners ﻿Winners, we are winners ﻿It's a crazy world and it's not always easy ﻿To be strong in this madness ﻿To know not to hurry, and let time tell the story ﻿To believe in love. ﻿Even if it's dark and there's nothing to light my way ﻿Even if I fell in front of a million people ﻿What matters is that I didn't give up ﻿Let's go all the way with our hearts and come out winners. ﻿Winners, we are winners ﻿Winners, we are winners ﻿Winners, we are winners ﻿Winners, we are winners ﻿Even if it's dark and there's nothing to light my way ﻿Even if I fell^ in front of a million people ﻿What matters is that I didn't give up ﻿Let's go all the way with our hearts and come out winners. ﻿Mr. Shavit, ﻿my students and their friends deserve our department. ﻿We hope it's not too late. ﻿He says he agrees not to close it down. ﻿Okay, Kimmy, back to work. ﻿I'm so happy, I could make everyone spinach-vanilla cupcakes. ﻿No. -No more of that. ﻿I have to go. ﻿Thanks for everything. You're a real king. ﻿Not anymore, but I'm better off this way. ﻿Tai. ﻿Hi. ﻿I wanted to update what I said about people who can't change. ﻿People really can't change. ﻿Okay, thanks for the update. ﻿Wait, that's not the update, it's... ﻿a preliminary comment. ﻿The update is that... ﻿people usually don't change ﻿because they don't believe they can. ﻿But then someone shows up who really believes in them ﻿and somehow gives them the courage to try. ﻿And the fact that they even try ﻿is what changes them. ﻿You understand. Anyway... And yesterday, ﻿I went out for a walk ﻿and suddenly realized I was lost. ﻿And you know what I did? ﻿What? -I looked for the Tapinoma's nest. ﻿And I found my way back. ﻿And I think I just sang ﻿in front of loads of people, ﻿did I just sing in front of loads of people? ﻿Yeah, you really did it. ﻿So I just wanted... ﻿to update you. ﻿I ate pizza yesterday. ﻿Okay... was it good? ﻿With my hands. ﻿Congratulations! -Thanks. ﻿So I guess I changed a little too, thanks to... ﻿a certain someone. ﻿And thanks to that certain someone I have my own agency now ﻿and I'm only going to do what I believe in. ﻿So thanks forthat. ﻿Looking for clients? ﻿To be honest, yes. ﻿Great, 'cause I was thinking... ﻿of offering myself as a candidate. ﻿Sorry, but I can't accept you. ﻿Oh... okay. ﻿You know what they say... ﻿You shouldn't mix ﻿business with love. ﻿Business with what? ﻿Love. ﻿We can learn to set boundaries... ﻿Yali sweetie, how are you? I heard it's your Bat Mitzvah, ﻿so this is for you, Yali. ﻿What have you done to me... What are you doing? Turn right! ﻿Shit, the phone! ﻿Where is it? -I can't see it. ﻿Don't you have Waze? -I don't believe in Waze, only in my intuition. ﻿I just got it! -Wait, I found it! ﻿Take a left here! ﻿Come on, Maayan! -Sorry. -Shit. ﻿Did something happen to it? -No, here, I found it. ﻿It's still filming.
