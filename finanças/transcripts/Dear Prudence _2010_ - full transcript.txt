I want to see everything you stole. Put it on the table. Come in. Get your hands off my ass, pervert! Michel, I'll deal with this. I wasn't gonna stay. - Empty your pockets. - I'm clean. Put the helmet down. Get undressed, fast. I don't have all day. Shit, you're slow. Move your butts, girls. Hurry up, take your pants off! I've got work to do. So, what do we have here? Not very clean, are you? Hope there's nothing in your panties. You can see for yourself! You're going to stay here a few more minutes, young lady. You can get dressed. Prudence Friedmann... Karl Marx High, Villejuif. Lots of Jews! Can I get dressed? - Are your parents at home? - No. They have a work number? - My dad's on a trip. - Where? - He had to settle an inheritance. - I said "where"? Canada. Yeah, sure. And your mother? My mother's dead. Of course, no one's home, everyone's dead! Call for yourself. That's what I'll do. Here's your file, we have you on record. Next time, it's straight to headquarters. Where're your manners? Look at me when I talk to you. You should be ashamed, what if your mom saw you? That's the good part, she can't. Hey guys. Where the hell were you? Nowhere. Dad? How are you, sweetie? Ok. And you? Were you sleeping? - No, no. - Are you working hard at school? That's all I do. Who are you doing it for? I know... - Say it... - For me. Good. Let me talk to your sister. Is she asleep too? - No, I'll get her. - Be quick. Frederique! It's Dad. She's in the shower. She can't come. Have her call me back ASAP. She's running late, how about tonight? No, tell her to call me now. Even for five minutes. It's important. When'll you be back? You should see the snow, it's so beautiful. When? That's why I need to talk to your sister. The world we're about to enter is one you might not know: the world of bikers. Rungis is where the Parisian wholesale food market is located. Fridaynights it's deserted, and these long tracks turn into a biker's hell. Every Fridaynight, hundreds of kids rip loose on their two-wheelers. They call it "getting high", the raw pleasure of taking yourself to the limit and playing with danger. Danger that sometimes ends in death. Only 10 days ago, two fatal accidents occurred at Rungis, making a total of 14 dead in four years. Rungis: the sanctuary. Miles of blacktop, where kids come to prove themselves... What are they looking for? They're looking for thrills. They want to show off... There're plenty of showoffs. Their powerful machines can spin out of control, but it doesn't slow them down... Jean-Pierre, can I have a coke? Hi. Hi. Wanna come to my place? What for? I don't know. There's lots of stuff to eat. We can smoke cigs, or invite people over. What about your parents? No one's home. - No one? - No one. Hello, Mr. Santamaria? This is Prudence's mother speaking. My name is Arlette Friedmann and I wanted to know if Maryline could stay over this afternoon? The girls like to study together. Ok, fine. Yes, of course. She'll be there. Thank you. Would you like to talk to her? Ok. I'll tell her. Thank you. Goodbye. You see? Did you hear the son-of-bitch? - Can I have some hot chocolate? - Make it yourself. Alright. How long are you staying? What are all the sheets for? What're they for, huh? Prudence, Prudence There's danger lurking Prudence, patience You'll feel the influence Fast asleep in her sheets Like a sharp knife, snug in its case Wait for me, wait for me Prudence, patience You'll feel the influence Not everyone has your luck Your indolence Fast asleep in her sheets Like a sharp knife, snug in its case You'll feel the influence... You like this song? I really dig it. Yeah, I like it too. Where're you from? It sucks. Your dad listens to this shit? Did they name you after it? I don't know. My dad would kill me for less. He lets you go to the run. When's your old man back? I don't know. You're so lucky. I'd die for a place like this. No one to hassle me. You know this? It's the biker's station. You've seen it before, it's my new souped-up Kawasaki... I know him. No way. You go there often? You go by scooter? How else? When there's a meet, you need a clear mind. You put everything else on hold. Who's that coming? Jacques! What a cool dude, always got a story to tell. Better have lots of time... If you pick me up and take me to the track, I'll give you a set of keys. Are you free tonight? You're wearing that? Let's get a move on. Prudence! What're you doing here? Where were you going? This is Frederique, my sister. Maryline. Hi. Thanks for the homework help. - Wait! - I gotta go. Get in the car. I fetch the princess and she pouts. You're wearing Mom's necklace? Michel, start. He's coming. No, we'll wait for him. We're hungry. Daniel, dinner's ready! Here, Sonia. Hello, Friedmann sisters. Excuse me. A sweet year, my wife, like this apple dipped in honey. Amen. A sweet year, Prudence, like this apple dipped in honey. Amen. A sweet year, Sonia, like this apple dipped in honey. Your kippah. What about it? Take one of your clips off. Do as I say. I need two, I've got a big tuft. What's with the hair? Let me guess. It's the latest fad in Paris? Get off my back. I didn't hear you? - I'll say it again... - I heard you! Sit down! Don't get up without my permission. Or else? Daniel... In five minutes you'll call it a sin? "Sin" is how we treat ourselves. "Sin" is you, "sin" is me. "Sin" is arguing amongst ourselves on the first day of the Ten Days of Awe. Do you understand your prayers, Dad, or do you pretend? Frederique, did you find the food? Was everything fine? Yes. Do you need anything else? Mom, who cares? We're finally talking. What have I done wrong? Drop it, Daniel. A good year, my son. Amen. Let's have some wine. Some wine? Prudence, would you like some? No, thanks. Don't mess up, ok? Otherwise I'll be in trouble. Who was that girl with you? No one. - You know her from school? - What? - You know her from school? - No. Show me your tits. - What? - They've gotten bigger. - Really? - Yeah, look at them. Your tits are bigger. Are you sure? Let's see yours. Are you on the pill? I have been for ages. - Are you pregnant? - Certainly not. Mine aren't any bigger. Me either, you're just being mean. You're so obnoxious. - Does your guylike to suck them? - Are you nuts! Don't touch. And I don't want to talk about my boyfriend with you. I'll take you home. I'm staying here. You sure? Maybe he'd fall in love if I slept with him. Why don't you try? Are you crazy? My dad would kill me. How would he know? Because I'd tell him. I can't help it. I couldn't lie about that. Anyhow, he'd know and he'd kill me. You didn't tell him the rest. Be quiet! Don't talk so loud! Don't worry, no one can hear. I can't even hear myself. Hand me the green towel. Here. With Christian it's different. At least you gave him head. You never have? What about Jerome? We only slept together once. I never even saw his dick. No way! What about a hand job? No. Serious? Ok, I gave him a hand job. What's the big deal? I gave him a hand job but I think I hurt him. Was Jerome circumcised? What do you mean? - You don't know what it is? - Of course I know. Are you kidding me? Was there skin at the end of his dick or was it smooth? It was smooth. He always had a hard-on. What? Forget it, you don't know. You'd tell your dad everything? You're insane. I'm not a liar. He could've settled everything in 48 hours... When I talked to him on the phone, he cried. Wouldn't you cry if you were him? I can't stop thinking about her. She was so healthy, and then from one day to the next, gone! And her daughters, the poor girls. Mylittle Prudence... Don't worry. What'll she do without a mother? Come to bed. Come on, Sonia, let's go to Rungis. Are you out of your mind? Hurry up, get dressed. Get your stuff. Come on, get dressed. Run! What're you doing? What's going on? Hey, stop! The 125s, to the line! What the fuck you doing! What's a scooter doing here? Back over there! Get out of the way! Beat it! Samir, check out the 600cc. Maryline! You came! - This is Jean-Pierre. - Hi. - And Samir. - Hey. The guy taking a piss... he was the guy on the radio. Reynald Coste. You see Reynald's machine? He refuses to lend it to me. I can't argue, it's his. Isn't she a beauty? Come on, let's cross! What'll it be? - A beer, please. - One beer. - How about your friend? - A coke. How much is it? It's on me. Cool, thanks. How's it going, Yannick? Not bad. And you? Everyone knows his big passion was his Kawasaki. In a way, you could say his infatuation was premonitory, he left this world like he lived, in high gear... He turned a few tight ones, he was reallyracing hard... Then he tried one too many, and that was it, he hit the outer sidewalk. Everyone jumped aside and he crashed... What're you doing? You're not dressed? Why don't you answer? I'm a real woman now. Are you kidding? I did lots of stuff before, but I never did it. Are you serious? Yeah. Me, it's the opposite. We're different. I wanted it to be with someone special. At least someone I liked. I haven't been attracted to many people, you know. You know who I had my first crush on? It's so weird... You remember Journot, the French teacher? She's gone now. I was crazy about her. I was totally obsessed. I made her life miserable, just so she'd notice me. I did everything I could, just so that... It's pathetic. I'd follow her in the hallways, I got a hold of her schedule... I knew when she'd walk past... It was a huge mess in the end. I went a little too far... Where'd you get that? What? The bracelet. Nowhere. I found it. Oh yeah? Where? Hello! Where'd you find it? I told you, I found it. Is it a crime to ask? Don't get mad, Sonia. You still having your party? Yes. When? Tomorrow. It seems to make you happy. What? Ever since Arlette passed away, all you do is go out. You're even throwing a party. It's just not done. Normally you don't have the right. For one full year. You don't even seem to care. It's not true. May I? Come in. You sleeping here tonight? This is nice. What was your dad going on about last time? He's an asshole, it's nothing new. No, what are the Ten Days of Awe? Since when are you interested? Don't you know? They're also called "Ten Days of Repentance". Abigail... Beautiful Abigail! It all started like this... It's the story of David, Naval and Abigail. Abigail was a diplomatic, intelligent woman... On the day of Rosh Hashanah, David decided to punish Naval because he had refused him hospitality. Abigail learned of this. So she immediately set out to meet David and his 400 men with cartloads of food and provisions. She threw herself at his feet and she said: "It's my fault, David, it's myfault. "Forgive me, I beg you, my husband is a fool." She ran him down and everything. "God sent me." She used great tact and intelligence, like all women... But not only... No, not only. David looked at her - she was truly a great beauty- and the flame of desire was sparked between them. Temptation. Despite the risk of committing adultery. David knew she would offer herself to him. Suspense. But that day, nothing happened because she was "impure". A "bleeding woman" as they say. - She had her period? - That's right. Gross. Why, it never happens to you? So she went back home and found a big celebration going on. Everyone was dancing and singing. And her husband, who was rather drunk, was in a very good mood. Then she did something odd. She waited to talk to him. She waited for her husband to sober up. And then, in the morning, she told him everything. Naval was thunderstruck by the news, he felt his heart turn to stone. And ten days later, on Yom Kippur, God struck him down and killed him. So what's the moral of the story? Go on, spit it out. Naval realizes that he's messed up all across the board. His wife, his money... he's lost control. He's not prepared to look himself in the mirror. It's a gift that Abigail gives him. She wants to help him. That's a bit of help. A bit of help. She gives him a chance. A chance to take responsibility for himself, to take a look inside himself, and come to terms with the fragility of his existence. Not too much, ok? It's not the quantity that counts, it's the time. Then I won't leave it long. Don't move. Why didn't you ask your mom? She's the pro. I'll be the pro if I flunk exams. Come on, Sonia, you won't be a hairdresser. Besides, your mom likes her job. She doesn't make much. And she works like a dog. If she didn't close Friday afternoons and all day Saturday, she might do better. What have you got against Sabbath now? Nothing. It's just that girls get prettied up on the weekend. Now you wait 30 minutes. Thirty? It said 15 on the box. No. You're a brunette, if you want it to work, it's 30. Your turn, I'll do your streak. She has your keys? Getting dolled up? Not anymore, I'll wait to see you. I'm a guinea pig? You wanted to. I changed my mind. Honestly, you look very prettylike that. Guys love blonds. It's not bad at all. Not bad? What do you mean? Get lost, bitch. You're gorgeous, you look like a doll. - Leave me alone. - What's wrong? You don't believe me? - You don't believe you're beautiful? - No. Are you scared of me? Are you a Jew? I'm a Jew too. If we have kids, we'll circumcise them. Are your parents religious? You're deranged! Get away from me! Why don't you believe me? What's your name? Get away! Drop it. Who lost the Book Game? You did, Gregory, no? I'll get something. I took your mother's dress. What do you say? Not bad, huh? Get undressed. - I'm not wearing shorts. - Come on. I think I tore it. You're here? Like you didn't know? You smell sweet. I put too much perfume on. Don't worry. It's fine. We're pretty high. - You afraid of heights? - No. Too bad. We like frightened girls, huh, Franck? Right... We can take them in our arms and reassure them. I guess if I look down, I'm a little scared. Then let me reassure you. You have a cig? Want a light? Be quiet over there. I like this song. How about you? You know what you should do? You should pull your hair back. Look at me. Here and here... Like this. We'd see your eyes better. Can I tell you something? As long as it's something nice. My mother died. When? Sixteen days ago. You got anything to drink? Sure. Wait a second. That's a lot of books. Don't worry, no one reads them. How cute... Is it you? When I was little, I had lice. I was lice-ridden. I had lice all the time, until not long ago. Why am I telling you this? I don't know. Come on. Stop fucking around. Reynald, you coming? - I have to go. - Where're you going? - Nowhere. For a ride. - Can I come? You coming or not? Gerard, take her. I don't have a helmet. Put your helmet on. How about some omelets? It's too late for omelets. I'll leave you alone and let you work. How 'bout a kiss? Get lost. You're so cruel! See you. What's up? He wants a kiss. The starlet! Your turn for a round. Ok, my turn... I'm hot! She's coming. We're starving. How's your son, Gerard? How old is he? You should see him, he's adorable. Dark hair, not a carrot-top like his dad. Dark like his mother, a gorgeous brunette. It's all over! The passion's gone! I swear it's true! I'm passionate, and I'm single if you like! You jerk, I was that close. That close? You were that far! You can take a look at it. Maybe it needs a new gasket. Your bike's pissing oil? Yeah. You can't leave it like that. You gotta repair it. Otherwise the guy behind you eats it. Drop it, Gerard. You fucking repair it. Last year I hit a guy who was cleaning up a leak. He stood up and bam. I hit him straight on. What were you riding? A Benelli. What do you think? A total fury. Dell'Orto carb and all. Radical... The next morning when theylet me go, I asked about the guy. No one answered me. - Where was the guy? - Dead and gone. I got no ticket, nothing. No questions. You're not tired of our stories? Girls, I'm going for a swim. Are you cold? Yeah. Here, take this. Where were you, little bitch? I waited one hour for you at the Cohens! How do you think I looked? Where the fuck were you? Are you crazy or what? Calm down. Where'd you get the shoes? They're Maryline's. Very chic. - You idiot. - You're totally insane. - I was worried sick. - Why are you screaming? Look at the mess you made. You better not have smoked in my room. I hope you didn't wreck my piano. Why aren't you ever here? I don't come... because I can't. Because it hurts too much to be here without Mom. Do you understand? Not really. It's not because I don't want to see you, or because I don't worry. I do worry. Blow your nose. You've stopped going to school? Don't cry. Play something for me. - You want me to? - Yes. See you. Bye. Drive safely. Prudence! I'm sorry, I shouldn't have told her but she won't do anything. It makes no difference. Come out. I shouldn't have called Frederique but you're overreacting. I'm tired of you. You don't interest me anymore. You don't think I miss Arlette too? Maybe I miss her more than you. You ever think about her? No, you don't. All that matters is you. Excuse me. May I have a pin? Thank you. It only needs half an inch. Hang on, Franck. Stop moving. Mom... I think we need a new pair of shoes. What do you want? I'm looking for someone. You got no business here, get out. We've got work. I don't have time for games. You with the bike, out of here! Give me a break! I'm looking for someone! Where do you think you are? Franck... What're you doing here? I came to return your scarf. Come on inside. You gonna introduce us? - You want a coffee? - No. - Mehdi, one coffee. - Coming right up. - Will you show me? - Show you what? Where you work. What for? It's disgusting over there. We're not going to stay here. Why not? Show me. Come on. I'm sorry, my fingers stink of fish. Be careful. Wait, wait. What? There's a guy over there. - Who cares? - You don't have to do this. Go on. - Want to come to a concert tonight? - Yeah, I'd like that. You're pathetic. Why? I didn't sleep with him. But still. Want to come tonight? I can't get away. Come on. I can't go out two nights in one week. It's impossible. I'm going. If you go, they'll think you're a slut. You'll be their whore. You think theylove you? You think they even like you? They don't give a shit about you. "Whore"... That's if they still want to sleep with you. Are your parents home? My mother is. Ok, let's go. My place is small. Who cares? What'll your dad say? He doesn't care. I have to be at work at 3:00. That's in two hours. I live in a tiny hotel. My mother runs it. Hang on for dear life, as if you loved me. Wait. You're crushing me. Sorry. Who's she? Who? Her... She was my sister. Good morning. Would you like some breakfast? Are you hungry? Yes, I'm hungry. Have a seat. Can I stay here until lunchtime? Why? I can help you with the cooking, or the cleaning. I'm a good cook, you know. No, I'm afraid not. You have to go to school, and go back home. Parents worry. I won't bother you anylonger. Wait. Come here. Come inside. Aren't your feet cold? Here, take this for the bus. No, no. No thank you, ma'am. Don't call me ma'am. My name is Delphine. Hello, it's me. Bet you thought I forgot, huh? You see, I didn't. Happy Birthday, you little whore. Seventeen years old... Starting to get up there. Oklisten, go into the office and open Mom's drawer. The key is in the tray. The little silver one. Open the drawer, there's an envelope by the hearing aid. There's money in it. Take a 100 bill. Don't spend it all in ten minutes. By the way, I forgot to tell you the latest... Remember Corinne Sarlat... What's wrong? I'm hot. Want some candy? - Water? - No. - Where're you going? - I'll be back. - Where are you going? - To take a pee. Prudence! What are you doing? Why are you leaving? I'm splitting. Look at me! - Are you fucking with me? - No. - Do I look stupid? - No. Why are you treating me this way? I've had it up to here with your bullshit. All that matters is you. You came and messed with my head at Rungis! I fucked you, I did everything you wanted. Don't push me away! You playing games with me? You know what, get out of here! Go on, get lost. Little whore! Get lost. You wanna leave? What did you think? Did you like it? - Not bad. - It stunk. We're out of here. Come here. Hey, I dig the whistle. Come on, get on. Mom! Come help me. Should I put this here? Talk into my good ear. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mom. Why are you apologizing? No need to apologize for things that fall by themselves. Why can't you hear me? Why are you deaf? Where were you? Why did you leave? You scared me so much. I thought it was nothing. I called Dad... He told me to hang up and call 911. Little girls shouldn't bother with things like that. Go get my glasses for me. Go on. Tonight, can we stay in bed? And listen to music? Subtitles: Julie Meyer Subtitling: TVS - TITRA FILM
