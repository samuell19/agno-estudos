[music playing] Wow! Did you see that? It lit up the whole sky. Wow, look at them all. You know, my mom used to say you could wish on falling stars. I know what I'd wish for. What? I wish you guys would quiet down. I'm trying to get some sleep back here. Why don't you all quiet down? I have to get your so-called notes in order before we arrive at the site tomorrow. Oh, we got to get [inaudible]. You know what I've always wondered? When falling stars fall, where do they fall to? What do you mean where do they fall? They fall to earth. That's stupid. I mean, a star is bigger than a planet. Everybody knows that. They're not stars, they're meteorites. What? Chunks of rock floating through space. We're passing through a belt of them. Probably the tail of some comet, and they're crashing into us. What? Get away from those windows. You want to get killed? Ow, you're squishing me. There's another window right behind you. Uhh, uhhh. I tell you what. I'll go tell the pilot to be sure he steers around the meteors. Thank you. No problem. Permission to come aboard? What? When my dad used to take us sailing, that's what we had to say before we got onto someone else's boat. - Board ahoy, Miss Sandra? - Chandra. Chandra Weaver. Huh. Board ahoy, huh? I can tell you spent a lot of time at sea. Only when I crash. Speaking of which, I'm passing on a request. Try and steer us between the meteors, will you? Oh, let me guess, the Doublemint Twins? I have to ask. This Mugford guy, he's some kind of hot shot professor, right? Jonathan Mugford is one of the foremost experts on vertebrate paleontology in the country. And you're his personal assistant? And the other guy back there? Deke. He's a grad student which I can just barely buy. But what's with the girls? Trina and Kelly are students, too, and they aren't graduating from anything without some serious extracurricular activity, if you get what I mean. Can professors still get away with that? To tell you the truth, I think they're flattered. No accounting for taste. So what about you? Please, I'm one of the best damn personal assistants you ever saw. Being good looking, too, is just a bonus. So the professor's never hit on you? Just once. He won't do it again. Which doesn't mean other people shouldn't give it a shot. So what's such a big deal in Arizona that the professor's chartering a plane to take you all there? One of Professor Mugford's colleagues found a partial fossil of a previously unknown therapod with significant bird-like characteristics. A therapod is a-- A three-toed carnivorous dinosaur? Smart guy. Well, this one's got feathers and a toothless beak, which is kind of a big deal. So Mugford's been asked to check it out. Did you see that one? That was incredible. Yeah, this is the place to see a meteor shower. No clouds, no atmospheric haze. You've practically got a ringside seat. But we are safe, right? I hope you're just making conversation, because otherwise that's a pretty silly question. I don't know, an asteroid killed the dinosaurs. Yeah, but none of them were flying to Arizona at the time, not even the significantly bird-like ones. No, no one's ever been killed by a meteor, not directly anyways. Most of them burn away in the upper atmosphere, and 80% of the ones that don't hit the ocean. None has ever hit a plane? No sir, Ma'am. Although, I know a girl whose car was totaled by one. She must have been pissed. I'll say. The insurance company wouldn't pay her a nickel. They said a meteorite hitting your car wasn't an act of God, nothing is. Look at that. It's so close. It is close. I think it's going to hit. Holy shit, belt in. I'll tell the others-- No time. [screaming] DEKE: Uhh, are we in Arizona yet? What the hell? Holy shit, gasoline! It's going to blow. Uhh, uhh, ahhh. Oh oh. What happened? Nice landing, Cowboy. We're alive, aren't we? I don't know about the others. Oh, god, what's that smell? We're leaking fuel. Come on, come on, come on everyone, time to go. Come on, time to get up. Let's go. Time to go. Come on, ladies. Come on. Time to go. It's jammed. My god, we're going to explode! Come on, go, go, go, go. Get 'em out of here. You, come on, Professor, go. [explosion] You OK? Yeah, I think so. Oh, thank you. You saved my life! It's OK. Kelly! Oh,Trina! I'm so glad you're safe. - Oh, my hero. - Oh, shut up. Is everyone all right? Are you two OK? You sure you're not hurt? We're fine. If anything happened to you two, I would feel personally responsible. Where's Deke? Deke, Deke! Oh, my god, he's in the plane. He's burning up. Deke, Deke, where are you? Deke. Deke. Deke, where are you? Shit! Quiet. Quiet, quiet. I hear something. Ohhh. Over there. Ohh. Ohh. Ow. Deke, Deke. Deke, are you OK? Are you all right? Oh, yeah, I think so. Whoa, I'm dizzy. Oh, steady me. What happened to you? Oh, I-- I don't know. I guess I got thrown from the plane. Oh, right out the front door. The door was jammed. Out the window then. What do I know? I was unconscious. Ooh, ow, I think I've got internal injuries or something. Well, let me check you out. Huh? Uhh, ow, ow, oh. You're fine. Ooh, help me, girls. I'm still weak. We got you, Deke. DEKE: Keep me warm. What caused the crash? SEAN: A meteor. Oh, really, we were hit by a meteor? We weren't hit by it. It exploded nearby and the concussion took the plane down. I thought you were an experienced pilot. Well, this is my first meteor. Give me a break. We better find some shelter. We'll freeze to death out here. Have we got any blankets? Provisions? Yeah, in there, you want to go get 'em? There's no need for sarcasm, Mr. Pachowski. And call me Sean. Now according to my last checkpoint, the nearest town's is Cummingsford. It's about 50 miles that way. 50 miles? We'll find someplace to rest on the way. But we've got a nice warm fire right here. Uh, that way? - You got it. I'm cold. I'm freezing and I'm hungry. Can't we stop? It's colder sitting still. Don't you know where we're going? Towards town. Well, you said that was 50 miles. Will you two little bitches shut up? Hey. What's that? Up ahead. It's a house. It's a house. We're saved. What a wreck. It's colder here than it is outside. There's a stove. Yeah, and what do you plant to use for wood? Aha. Ta-da! Doing a little exercise? Just checking out the facilities. Who do you suppose this place belongs to? SEAN: I have no idea. Maybe nobody. It must belong to somebody. Yeah, well, I'd be happy as hell if the real owner showed up. We'd all be arrested for trespassing and spend the night in a nice warm jail cell. Aha. Lovely. I saw a movie once about a house with haunted drains, and that's what came out of the pipes. Have patience. What's going on? He's got water. It's fine. I mean, why wouldn't it be? It's probably spring fed. I wish we had something to eat. Me, too. Whoo. You don't care What you ingest, do you? Oh man, the last time I tasted something like that was in a whore house in Bangkok. I hope you're referring to a beverage. Whoo. Ooh. Hey, this will keep me warm. Wait, careful with that. You could go blind. - What's going on? Party time. All right. Yeah. Ah, a delicate but insouciant bouquet, not unlike essence of old gym socks. Ahh. How did you do that? What? It's just a little bit of soda pop. Give me that. What's this? I think it's a tub. What kind of tub? DEKE: A bathtub. Where's the faucet? There's no faucet. You fill it with water from the pump, heat it over the fire. Oh, a bath? I would kill for a bath right now. You're not taking a bath. Why not? We've got water. We've got a fire. And a tub. And a bucket. Why not indeed? After what these ladies have been through, they deserve a little creature comfort. And maybe you could sell tickets. I'm surprised you're such a prude Mr. Pachowski. You're a real piece of work, you know that? Go ahead, girls, have your bath. We'll be in the next room, all of us. [mooing] PROFESSOR MUGFORD: Hey, how's it going in there? Shut up. Take a drink, will you? Oh, hey, do you need a hand with that? Ow! What? Geez, a guy can't offer to help out a lady? What the hell happened to chivalry? It sucks. I mean, back in the day, I would have been-- [door crashing] You want to end up like him? I guess you forgot who you work for? I don't work for anybody anymore. I'm out of business. Act of God. Sit. (WHINING) Oh, that feels so good. It's almost worth crashing a plane over, you know? Don't hog that bath all night. Hey, when I get out of here, you can sit in here until you shrivel up like a prune. Ow. Wash my back. Aah! Ow. Sit down. No. I can't take it anymore. I'm going to go cool off. So your turn in the tub next? You wish. I hope you two are enjoying yourselves. What's your problem? My problem is that I was supposed to be an important dig in Arizona tomorrow, and now I am stuck in the freezing woods in the middle of nowhere. You'll be a couple of days late, that's all. Those fossils have been around 100 million years. They're not going anywhere. I'm sorry I can't be as cheerful about all of this as you. - Cheerful? You bet your ass I'm cheerful. We just got knocked out of the sky by a damn meteor blast and walked away in one piece. What the hell are the odds of that? Cheerful? Mister, I am positively giddy. You're drunk is what you are. Not yet, but I'm getting there. Ohhh. Oooh. Oh, it just doesn't get any better than this. Oh, my god. What the hell are you people doing here? Who are you? Who am I? I'm Moses Cobb. I own this place. You live here? Hell, no, who'd live in a shit hole like this? But I own it all the same and that makes you trespassers. Wait a minute. No need for the gun. I will need a gun should I decide to blow your head off, won't I? You got a point there. Now, what the hell are you doing here? We were in an accident. Our plane crashed. We were lost in the woods. We weren't lost. Let the lady do the talking. We needed shelter. We just came in to get warm. And what's going on out there? I best look for myself, hadn't I? Wait a second. You don't need to do that. I got the gun and I say I do. You there, stand up! Just hold on a second. MOSES: Ooh, well, cut off my legs and call me Stumpy. If you're going to have trespassers, this is the kind to have. Thank you. [loud crashing noises] Holds up pretty good, don't it? My pappy must put that down or maybe his pappy. Yeah, I saw that meteor you were talking about. Hit up going off place. Sounded like a dam atom bomb going off. Busted two of my front windows. I was headed over there to take a look, and I saw lights over here. You people are damn lucky to be alive. Where was it you were headed? We were headed for a dig in Arizona. Oh, a dig, huh? Like old bones, is that what you study, dinosaurs and such? That's right. That'd make you an expert on strange critter. You know, I got something you really ought to see. Well, actually this accident has put me badly behind schedule. I was hoping you could give us a lift into town. Oh, sure, I'll take you in first thing in the morning. Meanwhile, this is something you really ought to look into. No thanky, if it's all the same to you. I insist. Well, insist. MOSES: Son of a bitch. The wire's all shot. $0.10 please. What? That's what my pappy charged when he showed this thing. Wouldn't feel right not to do the same. No, no, no charge for ladies. How about you? I thought I was your guest. Here you go big spender. My treat. Thank you. Nobody's seen this in, oh, I have to say about 60 years. Granddaddy used to truck it all over the countryside showing it at fairs, carnivals, and such. Whoa, very cool. I think it's creepy. After awhile it got to be too dangerous. What's that supposed to be? I don't rightly know. I was hoping maybe you could tell me, you being the expert on the extinct critters beasts from the age before the flood. It's just what it looks like, a sideshow prop to swindle nickels and dimes out of gullible hicks. I can't believe you dragged me up here to see a pile of paper mache and chicken wire. Uh, what did you mean when you said it got too dangerous to take around? Well, it damn near got out of its cage more than once. Wait a second, you're telling us this thing was alive? Hell yes. Oh, please. You calling me a liar? For god's sake, look at it. The paint is peeling on it. Oh, that. Well, after it died we touched it up some. Thought maybe a museum or somebody would give us something for it. Let me give you a little free advice. The next time you want to pull a hoax like this, make it something a little more plausible, like a two-headed cow or a sea serpent or something. An arthropod of this size cannot exist. It is physically impossible. Its legs would snap if you tried to stand up. Its respiratory system could never support life. No insect has ever grown larger than a foot in length. Actually, during the Carboniferous period-- Shut up. No, you shut up. I should've known better. Smart mouth, big shot like you can't even believe what he sees in front of his own face. Always has a fancy sounding reason why no one else knows anything. Ah, you think I'm just a crazy old coot. What the hell, it's better you don't believe me. I won't be bothered by any nosy newspaper reporters or television people coming around all the time. Yeah, it's too late to take you into town. You can stay over. I'll drive you in in the morning. I've got plenty of empty rooms. I'm hungry. Don't worry little lady, I won't let you starve. You can sleep in the damn barn with that. Mmm, Heather, oh. (SNORING) Deke. Deke! Huh? Roll over or something, will you? You're snoring so loud I can't sleep. Oh. I don't snore. I stayed up all night once to see if I snored. Just can it. (GIGGLING) KELLY: Stop it! I can't believe I was like, oh no. No, I didn't! - Yes, you did. What have I told you kids? It's one o'clock in the morning and people are trying to sleep. Yes, Chandra. Yes, Chandra. Now I want you to quit fooling around, turn off the lights, and go to sleep. Yes, Chandra. Yes, Chandra. I mean it. Don't make me come back in here. Yes, Chandra. No, Chandra. Who does she thinks she is? She's not our mom. We don't have to do what she says. Quiet! She's going to hear. Turn off the light. I don't want to turn off the light. It'll be dark. What, are you afraid of the dark? I'm afraid of-- You're afraid of the spider thing. No, I'm not. All right. If you're so afraid I'll turn off the light. That's better. CHANDRA: Hey! You're going to get us in trouble. Stop it! You ever do it with another girl? I don't think so. Oh, it's nice. (SCRAPING SOUND) CHANDRA: Hello. Hi. CHANDRA: Did you hear something? Yeah, like something scraping up against the house. What was it? I have no idea. Huh, well, I guess I'll go back to bed. You need someone to tuck you in. Careful what you wish for. (SNORING) Aah, ahh, ahh, ahh. [scream] If you don't like it, just say something. [gunshot] What the hell's going on? It's alive. Damn thing's alive. [gunshot] - What, huh? What's alive? What's all the shooting? What's happening? Damn it all to hell. The thing was alive. What was all that about? I have no idea. What the hell? Everyone all right in here? Yeah, Trina had a nightmare and thought she saw a bug monster. I did see it. I wasn't asleep. I should hope not. What was that noise outside? It sounded like gunshots. It was gunshots. Old man Cobb thought he saw something, too. Ohh. There was nothing there. I saw it. There was nothing there and you saw it? You know what I mean. Damn, I'll be glad when this night's over. All right, come on, back to bed. You girls need some rest. Come on. Ahh. What the hell? Go to sleep. Morning. Morning. How's the head? It's been worse. Help yourself, then take a seat. I need to talk to you. Hair of the dog? What the hell, why not? Good. Now, them other fellas, the girls are just girls, and the two guys seem pretty useless to me. But you look like a guy who could handle himself in a scrape. Can you use a gun? Sure. I bet you think I'm just a crazy old bastard, don't you? No, don't answer it. I don't think you saw a giant bug running around last night if that's what you mean. Maybe. But that thing in the barn, I never saw it alive. It was before my time. My daddy did. He told me so, and a more honest man never lived. Here's what I think. My granddaddy found that monster right after that big earthquake 100 or so years ago. Last night that meteor hit, another one of them bastards shows up. I think those big jolts in the ground scare him them up from deep down where they live. I'm aiming to go out to that meteor site and look around. And don't mind admitting I could use a little back up. Aw hell, if there's nothing there, there's nothing there. I'll have to admit I'm getting senile and that'll be the end of it. What do you say? Good. No time like the present. Let's get a move on. Hey, what's going on? We're going out to check the meteor crash site. Oh, I'll get my jacket and boots. This ain't going to be no lady's picnic. What? Nothing. What do you mean by that? Nothing. Get your shoes on. I'll be right back. Let's get out of here. Ain't scared of her, are you? Let's just say I don't want to piss her off. Hey! Where the hell do you think you're going you son of a bitch, sexist bastards? It must have been quite a blast. Yeah, enough to knock a plane out of the air. See over there? I'm thinking that the blast must have opened up that cave. It seems more likely that the blast would have closed the opening, huh? Maybe but something most have cleared it out again. Damn, you are scared. I thought you didn't believe in bug monsters. I don't. I just never liked caves. I always get the feeling they're going to collapse on me. This one's been here a million years. A million years, my ass. It was dug out yesterday. Wait outside then. I'm coming. Did I say I wasn't coming? We should have brought a flashlight. There's one in the truck. Why don't you go get it? What's that supposed to mean? It means I can't see in the dark any better than you. Go get the damn flashlight. I don't like leaving you here alone. I ain't scared. Come with me. Just git. Mr. Cobb? Mr. Cobb, are you all right? Oh my god! Mr. Cobb. What happened? What the hell happened? Aaahhh. [gunshots] What the hell were you trying to pull? Where is everyone? Inside. What's with that lady's picnic crap? OK, we're going together. We're getting out of here right now. Trina, Kelly, Deke, get down here. What's going on? Where's Cobb? - Dead. - What? What happened? He really did see something last night, and so did the girls. We found the cave the creature came from, it got him. What? Kelly, Trina! DEKE: What's all the noise about? Where's Mugford? He's out in the barn looking at that stuffed bug. Go get him. Tell him we're leaving now. What's the big emergency? Now! All right, Tarzan, take it easy. Where's Kelly? I think she's in the bathroom. Get your clothes on. We're getting out of here. What's he all worked up about? - Just get moving. - Why? What's going on? The thing you thought you saw last night? You really did see it, and it's coming back. What? Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. - Kelly! KELLY: Hello, somebody's in here. Occupado. Kelly, come out of there right now. KELLY: Wait your damn turn. Kelly, this is an emergency. Come out of there. KELLY: You're a guy, go outside. Kelly, come on, this is serious. Come out here now! KELLY: For crying out loud, can a girl piss in peace? Break the door down. What? Break the door down. KELLY: Oh my god. Ow, come on. This is-- this is the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to me ever. Professor! There's some big deal going on, and we're leaving right away. No, I'm not leaving yet. What? Why not? This is real tissue, not a fossil, not a fake, mind you, real desiccated tissue. That old man may have been telling us the truth last night. Really? But you said a bug couldn't get this big. Well, it is clearly not a bug. Look at the thorax. I don't know what it is. And neither does anyone else. I have to get it back to the lab somehow. There's the pickup truck outside. Right. Well go see if the keys are in it and bring it around here. Gotcha. Yes! Aha! Sweet. Hey! What are you doing? Deke. Deke, this isn't a joke. Get out of there. This isn't a joke. Deke! Fuck you. Give me the keys or I'll shoot. Whoa, man, what the hell are you doing? Shit! What the hell is wrong with you, you moron! [bangs] What the hell was that? [gunshot] Aaah. Aahh. Aagh. [screaming] [screaming] Nice work. At least we know the eyes are vulnerable. Oh god, poor Deke. Take care of them, I'll be back. Son of a bitch! Are they gone? Yeah, Chandra chased them away with a kitchen knife. That is not funny. It's not supposed to be. Bullets bounce off their shells but their eyes are vulnerable. You're going to be real useful. Poor Deke. He was a little shit, but he didn't deserve this. Who does? They just mangled him and left, like they were killing for the sheer pleasure of it. Well, maybe not. We may be no good to them dead. Meaning? Inside. So what were you saying out there? There had been an accident, but he was killed. Dead he would be no good to them as a host. A host? They may be parasitoids They would want a live host in which to lay their eggs. Then when the larvae hatch, they would have a food source. Oh my god. PROFESSOR MUGFORD: Yes, nature can be ruthless. How are the girls? Scared to death just like the rest of us. I guess it could be worse. At least they didn't see what happened to Deke. I wish I didn't. We can't just leave him out there. What the hell else can we do? We can bury him. I'll take care of the body, but you've got to cover me. I am not going out there again. I have never even fired a gun. You said yourself bullets are useless. That makes two of you. Give me that. You sure? Sure I'm sure. And I'll even reload it since you used your last round five minutes ago. Wise ass. Shells are on the kitchen sink. I'll find a shovel. This is going to come in real handy. Opening your own hardware store? You never know what will come in handy. Dynamite. Oh, well done, Mr. Pachowski. Ready? Yeah. Interesting name, Sean Pachowski. Is that the County Court Pachowski or? Well, look who's talking, Chandra Weaver. At least I came by my name honestly. Mom was a lovely Boston Irish lass. And my paternal grandfather, straight off the boat from Krakow. You, on the other hand, have an Indian first name and an English last name. And I'm pretty sure you're not Indian. But I'm damn sure you don't have much Anglo-Saxon blood flowing through your veins. Yeah, well, welcome to the melting pot. Ah, god bless it. I think that's deep enough. One, two, and three. Well, that's all of him. Nice sense of humor you got there. Well, I'm pretty happy to have it right now. It's all that's keeping me from ending up like Mugford in there, the human jellyfish. Try not to be too tough on him. We can't all be heroes. Just us, lady, just us two. What now? Now? We need a plan. Let's get everyone together first. What was that for? I'm sorry. I didn't know it was him. Are you OK? Did I hurt you? Hell, no. How can you possibly hurt anyone by bashing their skull with a frying pan? Sorry. I was just guarding the door. With a frying pan? Well, we decided we weren't going to be scared anymore. Yeah. We're going to defend ourselves no matter what. Well that's very commendable. But I think we're going to need a better strategy than hiding behind doors and hitting them in the head with a pan. Such as? Well, that's what we're here to discuss, isn't it? 60 miles to the nearest town. You said 50. Well, we backtracked 10 miles to get here. The truck's useless and 60 miles is a good 15-20 hour hike. Now if we had a phone, we could call for help, but-- Give me that. Hello? Listen, this is going to sound crazy, but I'm totally serious. There are five of us here in an old abandoned house 60 miles west of Cummingsford. Well, there are these animals, see, these creatures. They are like giant spiders. Well, we think they came up from underground from when the meteor hit last night. No, no, this isn't a hoax. I swear to you. I know it's a serious offense. Great! Come on out and arrest us. You want the address? You get on the main road-- hello? They didn't believe me. Surprised? Not really. Give me that. Colonel Weaver, please. It's his daughter. Yes, Chandra. Daddy, oh my god, Daddy, you were so right. I need help. No, I'm not in Arizona. The plane was forced down. No, I'm not hurt, but you were so right about him. He's a monster. He's gone berserk. He tried to rape me. I'm in an old farmhouse, and he's outside somewhere. I'm so scared. I don't know. It's an old farmhouse outside of Cummingsford, 60 miles west of Cummingsford. It's the only house out in the middle of nowhere. Please hurry, Daddy, I need you. I can't hear you, my battery's dying. Hello? Daddy? There'll be a fleet of fighter planes in the air in 60 seconds, trust me. Just curious. Who tried to rape you? He did. What? Why you little bitch. Sit down. Hey, I had to make it plausible. Even my doting father wouldn't believe me if I tried to tell him about giant spiders. And he already thinks you're a letch. Well, the question is, how long are we safe here? Maybe they won't come back. They will come back, all right. How do you know that? Because they are obviously social animals. The two that were here will bring word of us back to the nest, and they will be all over us like ants at a picnic. Oh no. Listen, everything's going to be fine. Can I talk to you for a minute in private? All right, Mr. Pachowski-- Look, those girls are scared enough without you feeding them that bullshit. It's not bullshit. I don't care. If you have any entomological tidbits, you give them to me first. I decide if we pass them along, OK? From now on, around those girls, you're a little ray of sunshine. We see a thousand of those things coming at us, you just say, oh, look, those are good monsters coming to help us out, OK? You understand me? Good. The Professor and I have had a little chat. I think he's had a change of heart, isn't that right, Professor. Yes, well, Mr. Pachowski has described these creatures to me in a little more detail. I think they probably hibernate so considering how late in the year it is I doubt if they will travel very far from the nest. KELLY: Thank god. But just in case, we're going to take a few precautions. Oh good, you found some gas? Yeah, what's it for? Well, we're going to fill this trench, and if those bastards decide to come back, we can light it on fire and try to scare them away. Oh. Well, the drum's out back. It looks about half full. We're going to save a little and make some cocktails. Cocktails? Ah, good idea. How's Mugford doing out there? He's not much of a ditch digger, but he's doing his best. That must have been some conversation you two had. Piece of shit. Whoa, whoa, whoa, it's us, it's us. Do you really want them armed? We don't have much choice. Listen, sweetie, you don't ever, ever point that gun at anything with less than six legs, OK? OK. [inaudible] out back. Whoa, be careful, honey. I'm always careful. Yeah, I remember. Hey, I'm so sorry. It's OK, it's OK, just don't be smoking in here. OK. Where's daddy with the cavalry? Daddy's with the Air Force. Maybe That's why I have such a soft spot for fly boys. I hate high places. Well, what are you doing up here? I brought you some presents. Oh, bless you child. And I thought these might come in handy. Thanks. So what's the plan, big guy? Well, the plan is I sit up here all night for nothing because those monsters never show up, and then we get rescued. Plan A gets my vote. What's Plan B? The first sign of them I start trekking down, I try to scare them away. If they keep coming, you light the trenches by throwing your gas cocktails. If they still keep coming, you run around with a stick and try to poke them in the eyeballs. Shouldn't I stay and watch the other side of the house? No, the crater's that way. That's where they'll attack from. You sure? Hey, they're bugs. They're not smart enough to sneak up behind us. Why don't you go back inside before you break your neck? Why? You don't want some helpless woman getting in your way? I need someone down there I can trust. Those idiots will burn the house down underneath me. That's better. Hey, good luck. You, too. Hey. Drink it. You can't fall asleep, OK? You have to keep watch. What the hell are you people playing at? You think that little pop gun's going to make a difference when those monsters come back here? Probably not, but it's better than giving those girls nothing to do and watching them sit around and go to pieces. You've got to keep up morale, huh? That's right. And all I ask of you is to keep your mouth shut, not make things any worse. Oh yes, Mr. Pachowski has made that clear, too. You don't have much use for me since all of this started. That's not really true, Professor Mugford. I never had much use for you. Now, how about getting out of my way? To think I almost let her sleep with me. CHANDRA: You wish. What is it? Where are they? It's a false alarm. A false alarm? A false alarm? I don't want to hear any goddamn false alarms. The next time a stick of dynamite goes off, there better be so monster bugs on the way. Do you hear me? - I'm sorry. I said, do you hear me? I hear you. False alarm, my ass. Where are you? Where are you, you bastards? [scream] [explosion] [gunshots] Come on. No, no, it's got Kelly. Where's Kelly? Oh my god, she's inside. No, one of those things came up under the floor and got her. He pushed her in its way so it wouldn't get him. That's not true. I tried to help her. You liar. You hid behind her. You shoved her right [inaudible].. Oh god. What do we do now? We go get her. Do any good to tell you to stay behind? I'd shoot you before you got halfway down. Well, I guess you're coming now. You two wait here. Anyone tries to rescue us, signal them. Tell them what's going on. I am not staying here with him. It's too dangerous for you to come. Yeah, like here I'll be safe. Suppose I could trust you to not run out on us? Where would I run to? I hate caves. I just hate 'em. I wish I had a gun. It wouldn't do you much good. I ought to have something. Here. Those fuses are good for three seconds. Don't throw it unless you absolutely have to. You got me? I wish I'd brought that flashlight. Yeah, thank you. Hey. Hey! Down here. Hey. Hey. Hey!!! Hey. Oh the hell with 'em. Let the bugs get them. A therapod of this size does not exist. Aaah. Aaaaah. Did you hear something? No. It must be your nerves. Hold it, hold it. You're wasting ammunition. What the hell is it? It looks like a nymphal skin. Young insects shed their skins as they grow. This is just like an empty husk. Hey, I didn't sleep through all my classes. CHANDRA: Which way? Any ideas? How should I know? This way. Oooh. [screams] Come on, get out of here, go. [explosion] Everybody all right? Aaaaah. Aaahhhh. Oh, that sucked. Where the hell are we now? What the hell is that? I think it's the queen. Duh. Kelly! Do bugs have good hearing? I don't think so, but they're very sensitive to vibrations. Like loud noises? Well, yeah, I guess. Stay here and be quiet. Kelly. Kelly. Mmmm. Oh, hell. Shhh. [crying] Listen, you're going to be OK. We'll get you out of here. You've got to be quiet OK? [scream] I had to. I know. Aah, ahhhh. Aaaahhhh. [gunshot] [explosion] Kelly. [explosion] Just go, take her. Come on, come on. Got a date with you now. You only play with girls? Oh no. I don't think so. Aren't you going to go help them? Screw that. I've packed my last bug. Daddy! Daddy? Yeah, I'm adopted. Oh, Daddy. You all right? I'm all right, Daddy. Oh thank god you came. What the hell happened to you? Bug guts, Sir. What's going on? Where's that son of a bitch that tried to molest you? That was just a story, Daddy, to get you out here. I didn't think you believe me if I told you we were under attack by giant bugs. Well, I do now. How many of those things are there? Tons of them. And there's a queen just ready to spawn. Yeah? We'll see about that. Lieutenant. Yes Sir. I want you to get headquarters on the phone. We've got some arachnid ass to kick. Yes Sir! [explosions] COLONEL WEAVER: Are the charges all set? All set, Sir. And the men all clear? Yes Sir. OK, then let her rip. Yes, Sir. [explosions] COLONEL WEAVER: Well, that's that. Let's hope. Hope? What the hell are you talking about, let's hope? You've seen for yourself. Nobody can live through that. If you got them all. They're sneaky bastards. We got them all. And if we didn't, what the hell, let 'em come, and we'll kick their buggy asses again. No giant insect is going to take over this planet on my watch. And what's all this? He's a pilot, Daddy. A civilian pilot. Air Force Reserve, Sir. Yeah? Well, how come you didn't salute a superior officer? Come on. Let's get the hell out of here. [music playing]
