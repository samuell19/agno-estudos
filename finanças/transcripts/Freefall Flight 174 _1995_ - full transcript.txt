(MultiCom Jingle) - [Narrator] The following film is based on an actual event that occurred on July 23rd, 1983. Some names have been changed, composite characters used, and certain scenes were created for dramatic purposes. (dramatic orchestral music) - That's the storm front they warned us about. Might as well use everything this beaut can give. Ask if we can take her up to 40,000 feet. - Nothing like being able to get above it all. Winnipeg Center, this is Canada World 163 heavy. (static hissing) Yeah, we see it about 20 miles out. If we can slip up to 40,000 feet, we should be able to ride above it all. (static hissing) Thanks, Winnipeg. Moving up. (instrument panel beeping) - That's weird. How's the fuel? - Indicator inop. Computer says we're loaded. - Must be the pump. Cross-feed the left pump to both engines. (suspenseful orchestral music) (instrument panel beeping) - Just what the doctor ordered. (instrument panel beeping) - Sure the fuel's up? - [Copilot] According to the readout, we're full? (instrument panel beeping) (airplane rumbling) - Left engine's flamed out. Winnipeg, this is 163, We're having a problem. (rumbling) Right engine's gone too. Winnipeg, this is 163. We ha-- - We have a general failure. Got a dead stick here. Give me range, fuel, talk to me. - Glide. Can you glide her? - Stick's dead. Help me out. No hydraulics. (grunting) We're going into free fall. Free fall. - Going in! We're going in! (suspenseful orchestral music rising) (alarm buzzing) - [Computer] Simulation complete. Please exit the simulator now. - Is that some kind of joke? There's no way you'd land that aircraft the way you guys have got a programmed. - Dumb scenario if you ask me. Impossible set of conditions. Who ever dreamed that up? - It isn't a dream. It happened. (dramatic orchestral music) - Just look at that. Some beauty. - Yeah, it's brand new. Just out of the box. - Who's in the saddle? - Captain Pearson, Bob Pearson. - [Beth] Coffee's ready. - As usual you're way ahead of me. - I'm just keeping ahead of a day that's going to be busy. - Listen, if you want me to drive myself to the airport, I can leave the car in the overnight. - No, there's no need. I can pick up the cleaning on the way back. Besides, it'll help me pass the time. - What time? It's a quick turnaround. - Oh, I know. It's just that... - What's the matter? - Hmm? - It's not like you to be worried. - I'm not worried. I'm gonna miss you, that's all. Would you drink your coffee? The sooner you get started, the sooner you get back. - It still doesn't figure. I know by this record we got about 11,000 pounds of fuel. - Pounds or liters? - Pounds. No no, no, hold on. Maybe that's kilograms. - How much more? I got several thousand gallons left. - Gallons? Don't give any gallons, okay? You've got the pride of the fleet. The first 67 in service and we are now metric. Speak to me in kilos. - Sorry, boss. I don't really know that stuff yet. I got my work cut out trying to convert gallons into pounds. - Yeah, like we don't? You just standby, okay? If they at least convert the entire fleet, you know, instead of just these new planes. - Well, I really think you've got everything done. - Not quite. Meg and I are gonna go shopping. I want to pick up some fresh flowers and I've gotta get new sheets for the guestroom. - New sheets? Do you think you're overdoing it? - I want 'em to feel welcome. They'll notice a little extra care after they've been white-knuckling it for five hours. - White knuckling it? With me in the cockpit? - You, they'll trust. It's the plane that will keep them worried. - Listen, why don't you drive? - Bob, will you keep your wits about you? - I always do. - How many kilos in a pound? - Uh, 2.2, or so it says here. - Okay. How many quarts in a kilogram? - I don't know. I told you, check the on-board gauge. - It's got inop. - Well then how does a pilot know how much fuel's been loaded? - Computers, state-of-the-art computers. - I hate computers. Gotta be a technical person to run 'em. - Yeah, well then we both better check into a seminary. Come on, let's try the cockpit. - Okay. (dog barking) - Listen, Jim, my wife's not doing so well right now. (baby crying) Isn't there some other guy you can-- Yeah, yeah, I understand. Okay, I'll be there. (phone beeping) - You're going off again, aren't you? - I'm really sorry. The number two on the Montreal Edmonton flight broke his leg, skiing. They need me to take his place in the second seat. - But you just got back. - I know, but it's the new 767 and I begged to be one of the first checked out on it and now I'm the only one available who's cleared to fly it. (dramatic orchestral music) - Veronica will be here to help. I'll be back before you know it. All right? Hey. - Are you picking 'em up at home? - No, it's a quick turnaround. They're gonna meet me at the airport in Edmonton. You'll meet us on the way back? - I'll pick you up at the gate. - Is everything okay? - Yeah, it's fine. You just worry about having a safe flight, okay? - Okay. - [Announcer] The white zone is for immediate loading and unloading of passengers. - Try the switch anyway. - Great, nothing. Gotta rely on a computer. What's it say? - Whatever we tell it. It won't read the fuel load. We tell it the volume and it does the figuring. - Then it's not smarter than you. Better refigure the volume again. (sighing) - You'll be okay, won't you, sweetie? - She'll be just fine. We'll both miss you, but she'll be fine. - Are you sure? - You know the maternity leave would end sooner, besides really if you wanted to stop flying-- - It's just too good a job you lose the seniority. Yes, yes. Now you take good care of your daddy. - Bye, sweetie. - Bye. - You take care of her. - [Husband] Bye bye. - Shh. Bye. - Hey, Lynn. What do you got? - 174 to Edmonton. - Hey, we're together. Junior employees first. - Thank you. - Gotta stop being mad at me, Gloria. You'd hate it. Hell, I hate it and it's my family reunion. - I don't have to do anything. All I wanna do is go with you, as if we belong together. Maybe I could even make it fun for you. - I doubt it. All they'd start doing is prying. - What have we... You, what have you got to hide? - Nothing. - You just don't want me to meet your family. - Gloria, you know that's not true. I have a problem with my fam-- - I wish I did, Phil! Tell me, do your parents even know I exist? (dramatic orchestral music) - [Announcer] This is the final boarding call. - I can handle it. - 38. Hey, didn't you play minor league hockey? I thought the trade called you up to play the big team. What happened? - I got cut. - [Norma] Tickets? - Did you turn the thermostat down? - Yeah. Did you get us flight insurance? - What for? - Hey, Dave. - Mr. Pearson, taking 174 out. - Yeah, did you just bring her in? - I did indeed. Fuel gauges are dicey. - No kidding. She's brand new. What's the manual say? - Nothing. But like you say, the 67's just come into service. Not much pilot input yet. - Anything on the minimum equipment list? - The NEL says to check the load manually. After that, it's safe to fly using the on-board computers. You're handy with those things, aren't you? - Well, I'm getting there, but I'd rather have the gauge that went into a tank. Can it be fixed? - Don't know. You'll Ricky Dion in the cabin with you. I betcha he can get it right. - Ricky, well, there you go. - [Maurice] Dave. - Maurice, you taking Bruce's second chair? - Yep. - Well, after you get fueled up, let's make sure the plane is. - Hey, Mo. - Check the reminder file. Both Haber and Dunbar have birthdays this month. Send some trinket from Tiffany, forge my signature, and remember, I leave for Hong Kong on the 8th, so, Alicia, if there are any details that I have overlooked, please do not hesitate to contact me. It's very important have this itinerary completely-- - 11, four, 30. - [Man] Okay, 1.0 means-- - We gotta multiply by 178. - Love that high tech operation. What do you know about metrics? - Nothing. I'm still trying to think how much a quart is. - Easy. 6% smaller than a liter. Ah, jeez. - Alicia, I will be out of town for my anniversary. Have Jorge send some flowers to the house, roses preferably. Keep it under $60. Make a reservation at Betina for the night after my return. - [Announcer] The departure of Canada World Airways, flight 174, will be slightly delayed. - [Group] Ah. - [Man] No. - [Announcer] Please stay at the gate, as we expect to board momentarily. - Ol' CWA. If there's a way to ruin my plans, they'll find it. - At least the weather looks good. - Yeah, at least for now. - You know, there was a time when the decision to take off was mine and mine alone. But the new manual for these big birds says that you have to check me out first. So, what's the deal? - Well, the way I read the figures, we gave you 20,345. Enough to get you all the way to Vancouver, nevermind Edmonton. - What about this inop? - Well, we'd have to rely on the computer readout. - What if the computer fails? - Second one cuts in. If that goes down, then there's a third one for good measure. (chuckling) - If two of them go down, I don't think I'll be relying on a third. I understand Rick Dion's on board. He must know this machine. - Forecast looked from here. Should be a smooth flight. - It's okay, honey. I only looked worried. Besides, what can go wrong when the airline's top mechanic is sitting in the seat right next to us? - Hey. - [Pearl] Huh, Chris? - [Larry] Rick. - Hey, Larry. Good to see ya. - [Larry] Good to have you aboard. - Let's hope so. - She hates to fly, especially after a check delay. What's the problem? - Don't know, but Bob Pearson's in the number one seat. If he's satisfied, so am I. Once we're up, you should go ask him yourself. - Oh, he will. Can't keep him away from the business end of an aircraft. Okay, honey, got your seatbelt on? - Just getting it on. - "Got your seatbelt on?" (laughing) - Yes, I do. - You're smiling, Pearl. Look out. - [Pearl] It's an aberration. (laughing) - You're in C and D, down to your right. Have a pleasant flight. Good morning, sir. How are you today? You are in 23C, down to your right. Hi, how are you? - [Woman] Good. - C, down to your left, please. 23D, down to your left. Hi, how are you today? 30F, down to your left. Hi, how are you today, sir? 31D, down to your left. Hello, sir. You're in 3C. There's only two of you in first-class today. - Thank you. Should be a grand flight. - I'm sure it will be, sir. - [Bob] What are you saying? - I don't know. Fuel readouts were handled by the second officer. I guess it's your call. - Well, Davis and Coley had no trouble bringing her in. (door opening) - We're all charged up and ready to go. - [Both] Boo. (laughing) - You're welcome. - I'd feel better if we still had a second officer. Good to have someone to work the manuals. - The whole point of these birds is to cut back on the crew, save the airlines money. We're not saving 'em any money being parking attendants. (chuckling) Clear the deck, lads. Let's get this bird in the sky. - Thought he'd never make up his mind. - Fussy bunch, pilots. Good flight, guys. - [Bob] Thank you. - Tell Bernie that I will buy a full page in his tribute book for muscular atrophy or dystrophy or whatever. Then call George and tell him to get in Bernie's face about upping his orders with us. (intercom dinging) - [Larry] We've been cleared for takeoff. Will all passengers kindly fasten their seatbelts? (intercom dinging) (dramatic orchestral music) (instrument panels beeping) (engines revving) - Rather a sharp ascent. - It's a feature of these 767s. Sharpest ascent there is. - Sharpest of any commercial airliner. I was on a leer jet last month. We went nearly vertical on takeoff. (laughing) I'm a pilot myself. Perhaps the captain would give me a view of the flight deck once we're up. - I'm sure he'd be glad to. (light orchestral music) (intercom dinging) - [Larry] The pilot has now turned off the fasten seatbelt sign. Please feel free to move about the cabin. However, while seated, please keep your seatbelt fastened. Thank you. (intercom dinging) - I think that's enough peanuts for now, honey. Okay? How 'bout a book? What would you like me to read? - Can I have another apple juice? - How 'bout Babar, huh? You wanna go forward? - You don't mind? - I'm amazed you managed to stay put this long. Just remember to come back. Your son likes your company. (laughing) Um, any 10s? - [Bob] Great day for it, huh, Maurice. - [Maurice] Mmm, yeah. - You okay? You okay? - Yeah. (knocking on door) - Mind a visitor. - Rick. Get your dead butt in here. - Simple enough for ya? (chuckling) - If it was any easier, they wouldn't need a pilot. (laughing) - [Rick] That would make my job easier. - Hey, speaking of your job, what is that? - You got an MEL? - Yeah. - It should be okay. Just have to rely on your computer. It'll fly her for ya. There's more information there than you know what to do with anyway. - You got that right. (laughing) - So, how's your hockey, Bob? Or have you given that up yet? You know, you should at your age. - Hey. (instrument panel beeping) (ominous orchestral music) (instrument panel beeping) - That's not right. You have a manual? (light orchestral music) (ominous orchestral music) (instrument panel beeping) - Lads, it can't be this complicated. - It isn't. - You got something? - Yeah, could be. According to the book, the pump is probably fine and there is a safety backup. Either pump, left or right, can feed to both engines. - Let's crossfeed the left side to both engines. - Check. (instrument panel dinging) - What would you guys do without me? - I knew the answer all along. I just wanted to see if you guys would figure it out. (laughing) - Too exciting for my bladder. I'll be right back. (door opening) (door closing) - What's the matter with him? - His wife is very sick. - Oh. - They have two young kids at home. You know how it is. I don't really think he wanted to go out on this flight. Frankly, if I were him, I'd apply for some sick-leave. - We don't have enough guys checked out on these things as it is. You know how important they are to the company. - And to me. I need this job. I gotta buy me some new skates. - A new set of legs is what you need. (laughing) (keys dropping) - Oh, damn it. I wanted to give him this. (sighing) Way to go, Beth, huh? Send away for something, 'cause you know it's gonna make him happy and then you... (tongue clicking) (dramatic orchestral music) Well, next trip, I guess. Boy, will be glad when this day is over. - Hi. - Hi. Got a weekend pilot in 3C, says he'd like to visit the cockpit. You think Pearson would mind? - You better wait till Rick gets back to his seat. - Got that beer for me? The guy in 30F is knocking 'em back faster than I can supply 'em. - [Lynn] We're all out of the brand he's been drinking. He finished 'em off. - At this point, he won't notice. - How's mister macho in 31D? - On his third Vodka and tonic and in a deep sulk. - Oh, how sad. - I'll take this one. Give you a chance to sit. - So, are these planes so good it only takes one guy to fly 'em. (chuckling) - Bob is more than enough. These things fly by themselves. Feel like I could've stayed home. - How is Marie? - Pretty much the same. Not good. - Sorry, Maurice. - It's okay. Or it'll be what it'll be. How's things in the cabin? Busy? (laughing) - It's less than half-full. But I prefer it when it's so busy that you can't stop. Time goes by faster. - Well, you wouldn't get to enjoy the flight then, hmm? - That's fine by me. I hate flying. - Anything I can get you here, sir? - [Bob] Vodka tonic. - I know, sir. Everything okay here? Can I get you anything? - No, thank you. We're fine. - All right. - You okay? - Mm-hmm. You? - [Lynn] How's our littlest passenger? - I think he needs a change. Okay if I use an empty row? - I don't see why not. When it's this empty it shouldn't be a problem. Do you mind if I help you? I have a little baby at home. This is my first time away from her. Hi, sweetie. - Thanks. That'll be great. - [Lynn] Is this your diaper bag. - Yes, thank you. Oh, you're gonna feel better, yes, you are. Yes, you are. - [Larry] Found your young explorer. - Is my husband still in the cockpit or did he leave me? (laughing) - I can't imagine he'd ever do that. - You don't know him and airplanes. If you can, would you remind him that he promised Chris a trip up front. - Done. - Thank you. So, where were you, huh? (laughing) - And as you know, CC the usual suspects. Send it registered, return receipt requested. - Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry. - Any word on that trip up front? - We're working on it. There's an airline official in there at the moment, but as soon as he's out, I'll ask. - And Alicia, remind those airheads in travel never to book me on a plane that doesn't have in-flight phones. - Lynn needs you to cover the back. I think Hulk wants another Vodka. - Again? How many can he manage? Hope he's not driving when we land. - Maurice, when you go back, tell Rick his wife misses him, the guy in 3C, he still wants a tour, and I'd like a massage. - [Bob] So, what are you flying these days? - Well, I tried a P51 at the Farnham Air Show. It was fun, but Pearl and I are talking about moving to the west coast, so if that happens, I'll be looking for a seaplane. - Oh, the ol' pontoons, laddie, the ol' pontoons. - [Rick] Hey. (instrument panel beeping) - What the hell is that? - Second pump failure? (ominous orchestral music) - Can't be. - You better go off auto. (intercom dinging) - First officer, Quintal, to the front, please. - [Rick] I'll hit the books. (door opening) (door closing) - Apparent fuel pump failure. Get the drill. - Fuel gauge. - Non-operational. - Release the pump. - Check, no help. - [Maurice] Re-engage crossfeed. (instrument panel beeping) - Check, no help. - [Maurice] Scroll digital. (computer beeping) - Scroll reads ample fuel and range. (alarm buzzing) (rumbling) - Ooh. - Oh, God. What was that? - Oh, probably just hit a little air pocket. Nothing to worry about. Bye, sweetheart. See you later. I'll just take these. - Let's go sit down. - What was that? - I'm sure it was nothing. Pearl, I don't know what that was, but I am sure that everything is all right. - Well, would you please ask Rick to come back here as soon as he can. - Yes, I'd be glad to. - Thank you. (suspenseful orchestral music) (knocking on door) - The weekender wonders whether visit-- - Not now, Larry. - Okay. Then Rick, your wife wonders whether you're still on board. - Yeah, I guess I better see how she's doing. - Hey, maybe you can in here until Maurice figures a load, just in case we need a little help with our calculations. - Yeah, you got it. Tell her I'll be along soon, thanks. - Okay. - Larry, take it easy, right? We wouldn't want to worry anyone. - Of course not, Captain. - [Bob] How's it look? - Impossible. - Whatever it is, it has to be possible. Otherwise, it wouldn't be happening. What's your best guess? (pencil scribbling) - Try changing the altitude. (instrument panel beeping) That should prove it. - Both lights are off. - Exactly. It's like the idiot light on a car's gas tank. You go downhill, the fuel goes forward, puts the light off. You go uphill, the light turns back on again. It's not a pump problem. - Then what is it? Get the ops manual. (suspenseful orchestral music) Maurice, obviously it's not a pump problem, is it? - No. - Well, if it isn't a pump, then it's the fuel. - Yeah. - And more specifically, the lack of it. And both the lights are still out. Here, you check it. These are the ground crew figures. - [Meg] Bob in the air? - Yeah, he took the flight out to Edmonton, picking up his folks. - Ah, that's why the big marketing and the big shopping and all. - I thought I'd show off my cooking a little. - Good for you. - I can't remember the last time we ate in the dining room. - I guess he's been pretty busy, huh? - What, this time of year? Pass like ships in the night. Goes with the territory, I guess, huh? - [Meg] Yeah. - Been married for 25 years. What we lack in adventure, we make up for in consistency. - You okay, kiddo? - Yeah, I suppose. (laughing) How 'bout a cup of coffee? - I'd love a cup of coffee. - Your house or mine? - Yours. - Okay. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Someone screwed up the metric conversion. I just can't tell where or by how much, but one thing's for sure, there's not enough fuel in either tank to make Edmonton. (sighing) - Maurice, chart us a new course, lad. - Our best bet's probably Winnipeg. Get there on a couple hundred gallons or liters or whatever we got in there. - Winnipeg, is it, huh? Look at that weather. - Yeah, they said they're expecting low clouds, but you should be able to ride it out without burning too much fuel. These things are designed to fly, not crash. - True enough. Just need enough fuel to keep our forward motion. - Now, that you should have. (radio clicking) - Winnipeg Center, this is Canada World 174. - See if you can get 'em to get in touch with my wife, will you? I want her to know where I am, in case she needs me. - Winnipeg Center, Canada World 174. - Canada World 174, Winnipeg, go ahead. Loud and clear, 174. I have you radar identified 140 miles northeast of Winnipeg. You're cleared to the Winnipeg airport for an approach. Plan runway zero four left, over. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Two additional things. Get a crew list and notify the families of a delay due to diversion. Put Maurice Quintal on the top of the list. Right, we'll stay on the air. (knocking on door) - Is the problem getting worse? - Yeah, minor technical difficulty. We're diverting to Winnipeg. Better let 'em know, Larry. - Right away. (sighing) - He's gonna be all right. (instrument panel beeping) Oh, my God. We're running on fumes. Winnipeg Center, this is 174. We've got a bigger problem than we thought. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Roger, 174. (instrument panel beeping) - [Pearl] Okay, go down. - [Chris] Right there? - [Pearl] Then across. Back up. All the way to 23. Keep going. There, there, there. - [Chris] Right there? - [Pearl] Yeah, come on. - [Chris] There. - There, see? And it's just like the same one we're on. - Yeah, it is. - So, how 'bout a book? Oh? - Pictures. - Be my guest. Pick a color, any color. - Okay, I think I'm gonna go with this color. - Fine by me. (intercom dinging) - [Larry] Folks, we're truly sorry about this, but the technical problem that delayed us continues to hamper the pilots. They've decided to divert to Winnipeg. We should land there in a few minutes where arrangements will be made to get us to Edmonton. Passengers with connecting flights should inform the cabin staff. CWA regrets any inconvenience this unexpected diversion may cause. (intercom dinging) - Come on, I know you can do better than that. - Even if the load estimate is off by half, you should be able to make it with a couple of gallons to spare. You can drive us to the hotel, Bob. (chuckling) - Depends on what it takes to buck this turbulence. Heavy headwinds. - Here's how I figure it. Double check me. - [Man Over Radio] Canada 174, Winnipeg. - Go ahead, Winnipeg Center, this is 174. - Roger, 174, you're within landing range now. I'll be handing you off to your approach control and we'll be listening and hanging in with you. The emergency procedures will be in place. Contact approach control now on 119.7. - Good afternoon, Canada World 174, this is Winnipeg approach. Got you at about 22,000 feet and 130 miles. - [Maurice] 22,000 feet. - [Bob] Thanks, approach. - [Maurice] 130 miles. - We're working on our glide path now. - Ground speed, 335. Glide path. Got it? - Okay, listen, okay? Loaded, 20,345 units, all right, but it was pounds, not kilos. - Are you serious? (suspenseful orchestral music) - Yeah. - That's 2.2 pounds per kilo. You're telling me we're less than half-loaded? - Yeah. - Let me see this. - Have Larry report to the flight deck immediately. (alarm ringing) - Make sure the Red Cross is alerted and have a mobile blood bank get out there with us. Let's go! - Larry, get your crew together. Run over the emergency landing procedures. Don't freak out the passengers. Do it behind the curtains. Keep it cool. (sirens wailing) (intercom dinging) - [Larry] Would the cabin crew please report to the forward galley? (intercom dinging) - Here's to accurate dental records. - [Bob] Hey, what the hell's going on? - Routine, sir. Just routine for us to meet on long flights, check the liquor inventory. - Don't give me that bull. I'm a paying customer. I pay your damn wages. Now, what's going on? - If you must swear, could you keep your voice down? - Hey, hey, hey. - I knew I shouldn't have bothered with my stupid family reunion. I knew it. Thank God I didn't bring Gloria along. - At least you're on vacation. I gotta go back to work on Monday. - What do you do? - Coach at the local high school. - Well, I guess I pay your wages then, don't I? (chuckling) (baby crying) (dramatic orchestral music) - We'll be fine. - Or not. Either way. At least there's no kids. - Well, it's like we've always said, kids and marriage aren't for everyone. - No. Certainly not us. Wouldn't want to repeat our parents' mistakes. - So, how's school? - It's fine. Keeps me occupied. Bob's away, kids are grown. - Tell me. I've been thinking about taking classes myself. - [Beth] Yeah? - [Meg] Yeah. Leslie goes off to college in the fall. Can you believe it? - You're kidding. - No. How are you and Bob doing? - Oh, we're the same as ever. Things fall into patterns. You ever notice that? - Yep. (laughing) Lots of years create lots of habits. - Do you find that you start taking things for granted? - Like what? - I don't know, the small stuff. Little things that are left unsaid because you think you've got a lot of time later. - But there always is, time later, I mean. There just is. (dramatic orchestral music) - Yeah, I guess. (suspenseful orchestral music) (pencil scribbling) - Well, how am I doing? - Not good news, but not a disaster. (radio clicking) - Winnipeg Center, this is 174. We think we have a plan for a glide path. That is if nothing else goes wrong. - You'll be fine. We're clearing zero four left for you and we'll have a welcoming party when you're on the ground. - [Bob] Good idea, both. - Supervisor, we're assigning 174 to zero four left. Are the emergency procedures in place? - [Supervisor] That's affirmative. (siren wailing) - Form into first rank. Give a path to the medics. And make sure all the ambulances are loaded with burn units. Double check it, hurry, hurry! (suspenseful orchestral music) - Well? - Fair, only fair. This front gets any thicker, it's gonna slow us, significantly. (chuckling) - If that's our only problem, we're in great shape. - Bob only lies when it comes to hockey, right Bob? I'm gonna go see Pearl and Chris. - Good idea, leave this to the pros, but if you feel anything go wrong, you know where we are. - Yeah, same here if you need me. - There's some kids back there. Make sure the parents know to put their masks on first. - Are you the airline official from the cockpit? Because if there's room now, I thought I'd pop in. - We're in a landing mode. Right now's probably not a good time. - I've never seen a computerized cockpit. - Well, landing's all done by numbers. Maybe when we take off for Edmonton. - Just bring the Vancouver people to Edmonton. Save me half a day. These idiot delays are costing us a fortune. And I don't want to hear about Bill's junior son. - We're okay. There's nothing to worry about, except we have to go to Winnipeg. Other than that, we're fine. - Swear it? - I swear it. It looked a bit tight there for a minute, but we'll be fine for Winnipeg. And Bob Pearson's the right guy for the job. (light orchestral music) We're fine, Pearl, and I'll be here all the way. Just trust that we'll be okay. - Daddy, is mommy okay? - Yeah, mommy's fine. We all are. - It's okay, hon. I'm just being a goose. So, where were we? - [Chris] Right here. - [Pearl] Okay. Socrates stepped inside the flower shop. - It's vital that people near the emergency exits are strong enough to operate them. (curtain rattling) I'm sorry, sir. The Captain has put on the seatbelt sign. - Not to worry. Just using the lavatory. I'm an ex-RAF pilot. If the Lufthansa couldn't get me, I'm sure CWA won't. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Runway's clear. All emergency vehicles in place. - Come on, guy. Almost home. You can make this. - Cutting it fine. An error in those numbers from Montreal-- (instrument panel beeping) (rumbling) (all yelling) (alarm buzzing) Left engine out. Left engine gone. - I'll be back. Whatever happens, I'll be back. - Daddy! - Honey, honey, just stay put, okay? Here, let's go back to the book. What page were we on? Can you remember? - This one. - What the hell happened? - Left engine's gone. We adjusted the right thruster to accommodate it. (alarm beeping) (rumbling) (grunting) - There goes the other one. (instrument panel beeping) (power pulsing) - [Bob] We've got a general failure. - It's gone. I lost it. It just dropped off. 174. 174, this is Winnipeg, do you read? It's gone. (suspenseful orchestral music) 174, we lost your transponder, return. 174, 174, come in. Might just be their electrics. Going to primary. (radar beeping) Still nothing, Captain. Should be an untagged blip in this quadrant, but I got nothing. - We need some help here, lads. Some hydraulics. It's like the power steering in my car when the engine goes dead. - There's no, there's no redundancy systems when the fuel's gone, none. Only the emergency ram air turbine for hydraulics. - No hydraulics, no power, no transponder. We must've dropped off the screen in Winnipeg. - Where the hell's the ram air turbine. - It says here the RAT kicks in automatically when it reads two dead engines. - What the hell's it waiting for? - I gather you're a veteran at this kind of thing. - Me? Oh, goodness, no. Well, um, my husband is the airline's top mechanic. He thinks everything is fine, as long as there's lights in the cockpit. - And there must be power there. (laughing) (suspenseful orchestral music) (knocking on door) - Some of the passengers have noticed there are no lights. - That's fuel starvation. The electrics conked out when the engines went out. - Oh, God. Are we going down? - Like hell we're going down. This baby'll glide as long as I can keep the nose up. - That's the truth, Larry. Nobody here is planning on dying. - Alert the passengers. Use the megaphone. - And what do I tell them? - Keep them busy with an emergency drill. - Larry, tell Pearl I'll be there no matter what. - Don't know how long I can keep this up, lads. Gonna need a glide path. - Well, without power I can't do that. I need altitude and ground speed. - Ladies and gentlemen, as you can see, we have a further technical problem, complicating our final descent into Winnipeg. - [Woman] Oh, God. - The Captain is confidently we'll land safely, but regulations require we now follow prescribed safety drills. Everyone must remove their shoes, eyeglasses, jewelry, particularly earrings, anything sharp from your pockets. Make sure your seatbelt is tightly fastened, as low down on your hips as is possible. This is all just a precaution. We thank you for your cooperation. - [Man] Okay, quick, get those off. You better take off all the others. (suspenseful orchestral music) (plane hissing) - What was that? - Must be the RAT hole, popping open. - I hope so. (radar beeping) - 174, this is Winnipeg, do you read? - Give me a hand with this harness. (propeller humming) (radar beeping) (group chattering) - When instructed, cross your arms and hold the top of the seat-back in front of you. Then rest your head in your arms. Practice this now. (baby crying) Children can put a pillow in their lap or anything that would provide a cushion would be fine. - Here. Now, you make sure you hang onto that. Everything will be okay. - What's wrong, mommy? - Nothing. I'm sorry, Chris. It's all right. This often happens on planes and daddy always makes sure that everything is fine. Okay? (suspenseful orchestral music) (radar beeping) - I got something. 174, I think I've got you. Do you read me? (radar beeping) (static hissing) (seat thudding) - What's wrong with this? Why can't you people do anything right? This damn seat's collapsing. - It's designed to do that, sir. It cushions you if you just rest on it and don't try to mash it. - What's it matter? We're all gonna die anyway. - Would you please be quiet? I have a little daughter waiting for me at home and I have no intention of dying. - Bull. This plane's going-- - Sir, shut your stupid mouth! (suspenseful orchestral music) - I'm getting a little help with these hydraulics. RAT must've kicked in. (panels powering on) - Got some juice. Giving some power to the electronics then. - Thank you, God, and Boeing for this ram air turbine. (radar beeping) - Gotcha, 174, you're back on. Do you read? - Roger, Winnipeg. 174 is back. This is a mayday. I repeat, this is a mayday. We need a vector to the nearest possible runway. I'm at 22,000 feet and both engines have failed. We're on emergency instruments and I only have a limited amount of information to give you. Our heading is 230. So, if you'd please give us a vector to the nearest possible runway. - [Al] Standby, 174. - No power. You think you can bring in a 300,000 pound aircraft with a dead-stick landing? - Never heard of it. - Try and talk 'em in. Around to the factory over at Everett. This can't be the first time this kind of thing has happened. Now, the crew family's know the crew's been diverted to Winnipeg? (laughing) - I don't believe it. Do you always keep track of where he is? - Only when the in-laws are involved, okay? - Oh, right, okay. (phone ringing) (laughing) - Hello. Speaking. Really? Why? Oh, no, no, no, I understand, but as soon as you find out, would you give me a call, please? That's great, thanks. - [Meg] Everything okay? - The plane's been diverted to Winnipeg. - [Meg] Really, why? - I don't know. (suspenseful orchestral music) - There's a bit of luck. That storm's on the other side of town. What do you think, lads? - I don't know. I've never tried a dead-stick landing before. - I grew up on it. I'm an old sail planer. The trick is to find your optimum forward speed. If you keep the nose too high, you slow down. If you let the nose get too low, you become an aerodynamic rock. - I tried sail planing. Biggest problem's coming in too short. - Optimum forward speed is 220 knots. Winnipeg could you give us a reading? - Scattered clouds at 4,000 feet. Visibility, 15 miles. Wind of four knots at 350 degrees. And your range is, your range is 35, no make that 39 miles. - Roger, Winnipeg, got it. I'm holding 220 knots, Maurice. Do your thing. - 174, can you give fuel and souls on board, please? (chuckling) - Fuel? We still have fuel starvation. Souls on board are 63 passenger, four backend crew, and two very determined pilots. - It's a fuel problem, so smoke inhalation will likely be a bigger killer than burns. Where's triage? - Sir? - If there's no burns, lung damage cases get first attention. - All the units are prepared. - Good. Broken limbs go second unless there's head or rib trauma and I wanna 'em in the ambulances and off the runways, stat. - Yes, sir. (dramatic orchestral music) (crying) - Stop, stop, stop, stop. Are you all right? - Should I be? - You can't help how you feel. We're all in this together. I am right here for you, okay? All right? Okay? - yeah. - Okay, now, deep breath. (inhaling deeply) (laughing) Better? All right, sweetie. - Yeah. - Okay. - Okay. - [Larry] How 'bout you? - I'm all right. I'm just thinking about my baby. (sighing) Okay. Okay, we got a lot to do. (suspenseful orchestral music) - It's a hell of a lot easier dead-sticking a sail plane than it is one of these big babies. How am I doing, Maurice? - Need the range. - [Bob] Winnipeg, got a range for us? - 34 miles, approaching 10,000 feet. - 10,000 feet? I didn't think I was that low. - That's okay. Without the engines, I don't know how she can maintain cabin pressure anyway. You don't want the oxygen masks popping out. Might panic the passengers. (chuckling) - Might panic. I'd be surprised if they're not back there, knitting their own parachutes right now. How we doing, Maurice? - Not as good as I hoped. - I have it figured out. We'll be fine. We have to be. - Why? (dramatic orchestral music) - Well, because if we were to die together, there'd be no one to identify us. We don't have anyone else, neither of us. - Yeah, I suppose you're right. I've never thought of that before. Doesn't seem right. - It isn't. - I don't want it to be too late, Frank. We should have something more to leave behind than our personal libraries. - Yes, we should. It doesn't have to be too late, though. - Let's hope not. - [Bob] Winnipeg approach, let's have that range again. Could you repeat, please? - 174, your range is 20 miles. - Winnipeg approach, what was that range? Could you repeat please? - Make that 20 miles. Two, zero. - [Bob] Well, then we won't make it. - Say again? - We won't make it. There's no glide path that'll bring us into Winnipeg. If I keep this heading, I'll not only lose this aircraft, but I'll take half of Winnipeg with me. Can't let that happen. Look bad on our resumes. We're open to suggestions, boss. - We're working on that, 174. (suspenseful orchestral music) (passengers chattering) - Hey, it's Winnipeg! I can see the airport. Look, look over there. - [Man] We're getting close. Thank God. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute, there used to be an airstrip between here and Winnipeg. It's called Gimley. We're 18 miles out of Winnipeg. It should be there. - If it is, I don't see it. - Winnipeg, this is 174, my first says he did some air force time out here at a place called Gimley, you ever heard of it? - Gimley. - [Man] Affirmative. - Roger, 174. I flew out of it a couple of times. - Well, it's not marked. - [Al] That's because it's abandoned. - Well, it won't be for long. Give us a heading. (rumbling) - [Man] It's just turbulence. - I don't have it charted either, but I remember the place and I'm reading your position and I can give you an approximate heading only, but can you fly there? I think you're too high? - We'll have to side slip, a little bit now, and a whole lot when we get there. - [Al] Good luck. Here's my best guess on the heading. - [Man Over Radio] What's he mean a side slip? - Sail plane technique. Uses opposing forces, cross control ailerons and rudder and you lose altitude fast, damn fast. Turn right, heading 310, got that? - Roger, Winnipeg. I'm gonna give it a try. - [Al] He'll pull his rudder left and bank right. That pushes the plane sideways, giving it a bigger profile to the air current. That creates drag and slows it. But if it slows it too much, the plane will sink like a rock. - I swear we're moving away from Winnipeg. - That's impossible. We're headed-- - Look. - We're banking sideways. - Can planes go sideways? - This one is. - If there's a next time, Gloria, you'll come with. Thank God you didn't come on this one. (dramatic orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) - How long have I got, Maurice? - How do I know? I don't know where you're going. - Well, while you try and locate it, I'll try and keep this baby in the sky. Rick, could you hang in here till we spot Gimley. While Maurice eyeballs for it, I need somebody to keep their eye on my descent and glide path, okay? (patting shoulder) - You got it. But when we spot it, I'm outta here. - I gather you're an experienced flyer. When we land, can you manage that emergency door? - Pleasure to help however I can. - If you're as calm as you seem, I wish I were you. - Learned it in aerial combat. (light orchestral music) Sometimes style is all you have left. - Alicia, I'd like to dictate a letter to my wife. Actually, if you get to this point in the tape, could you shut it off and give it to Ann? Thank you. - God help me, this is hard. Maurice? - Just keep along the shore line. Can't find it yet. It's the first time in my life I'd rather be on the ground than in the air. - All right, Pearl? - I'm fine. I know that Rick wouldn't leave Chris and me if there was any real danger. As long as he's up there, we're doing fine. - You're right. You're absolutely right. (suspenseful orchestral music) - I'm supposed to pick up my folks at Edmonton. Wonder if anybody's called them. - We need someone, preferably someone strong, to help with the emergency doors. I assume you two would wanna stick together? - No, I can help. It's okay. It's all right. On second thought, we would like to stay together. - I understand. Thank you. - 174, come in. 74, enough with the tea, all right? - [Man] You okay, Al? - I would be if you leave me alone. It's gotta be there. 174, you're on the right heading. What's your altitude? - 4,000 and dropping. Find it, Maurice, in enough time, so I don't overshoot the strip. - [Maurice] Can't see it. - When do we reach Winnipeg? - The engine's dead. - Of course not. These are just very quiet planes. - Not that quiet. What fell off the bottom of the plane? I heard a noise. - That was just routine. - Don't lie to me. - Just be cool, okay? - Okay. - You wanna help? I need someone strong to work the emergency doors in case we need them. Can you do that? - Yeah, sorry. - Hey, what, what'd you do, close down the engines? This plane's awfully quiet. - It's just a quiet plane. Now keep your shirt on. - Wouldn't change seats if I were you. That's the only way they can identify the bodies. - Just try to be calm, all right? This is real hard on everybody. (suspenseful orchestral music) - 174, do you see small town along the spit of the land, the lakeshore? - [Bob] Nothing. Landfall's fading away. - Well, keep going. It's gotta be there, 174. - Easy, Al, you can't fly it for him. - I asked you to shut up. Sorry, man. I shouldn't have jumped at ya. - Forget me. Keep on 174. - It's no good. If they don't see it soon, he won't have the drag to drop on the runway and he'll lose his profile and just drop. What about Everett? Did you hear from the factory? - It's never happened before. There's no record of a plane ever running out of fuel. - Well, they're gonna make it. You just get some emergency vehicles out there. - [Maurice] I can't see it. I can't see it. - It looks like this is it, Ann. (dramatic orchestral music) It all seems silly to me now, all the time that I spent making a living and never making time to live. I should've worked on loving. (chuckling) I never did love working. It was just the illusion of winning. Sweetheart, I love you. I love you so much. (tape recorder clicking) - Yeah, have 'em clear the emergency vehicles and reopen the runway. And see if there's a control unit out in Gimley, just in case they find it. Right, I'll call the accident investigation board. Yeah. - Ready? - Yeah, and call the army. Probably gonna need graves detail. - It's gotta be there, it's gotta be there. - Stay calm, Maurice, and keep looking. We still got a few minutes before we drop. - [Maurice] I can't see it. It's gotta be there, it's gotta be there. - Can you drop it in the drink? - I can try, Rick. I can try. - He's gonna put her in the water. - Let's just hope this big baby swims as well as she flies. - 150 tons hitting at 120 knots. I'm not sure there's much chance of that. (suspenseful orchestral music rising) (dramatic orchestral music) Bob, it's no good. We're gonna hit water. - Winnipeg, this is 174. One thing I have left is to pull her to port. (crowd cheering) (remote clicking) - [News Anchor] The group of bankers withdrew the notion of a rise in the index. - [Announcer] We'll be right back after these messages. (phone ringing) - There. There, I see it. (grand orchestral music) - Yeah! - [Maurice] I see Gimley. - Yes! Yeah, all right. - [Bob] Winnipeg, what've I got? - Two runways. Right is sometimes used for light aircraft. Left should be empty. Can you see the two runways? - No, but Maurice is dead on. This has gotta be it. - Remember, go left. That's the unused one. (socket wrench clicking) - Hey, honey, how's it going? - Same as usual, you know, nuts and bolts. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Don't worry, mommy. Daddy can fix anything. - He sure can, but he may need a little help, just in case. I think we should pray. - Go left. Go left. Talk to me, Maurice. - Too fast, too fast, we'll overshoot. Lose altitude. - I'm already side slipping. - Then we'll overshoot. Drag. Drag. - Drop the landing gear. That oughta do it. - [Maurice] Gear down. - Nothing. - Alternate gear extension switch. - That's it, that's it. I feel it. (instrument panel beeping) - No. - Nose gear isn't locked. - It's too late now. (seat belt releasing) - God be with you. And all of us. - Emergency landing positions. (door opening) (door closing) - [James Voiceover] His face says it all. Must be going down. Wonder if the boys who flew with me in 1945 had time to think. I was so young then. Guess I'm lucky. - [Pearl Voiceover] He's trying to reassure me. He's still not thinking about himself. - Pretty soon, George, you'll be too fast for our little racing cup. - I don't come for the races, honey. It's the people. (laughing) (suspenseful orchestral music) - 3,000 feet and closing. Hang left. - Roger. Steady, hang left. - [Norma Voiceover] Why aren't I screaming? I should be scared. It's because I'm with you. I love you with all my heart. Why did it take us until the end to realize how much we had together? Just hold me. - We've just received reports of a Canada World Airways flight in distress, originally bound for Edmonton and re-routed to Winnipeg. The plane carrying 67 passengers and six crew had experienced mid-air mechanical problems. We have no word as yet whether the aircraft has safely landed. We'll stay with this story as it unfolds. (dramatic orchestral music) After the break, we'll come back with a full entertainment report. - No, I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. - Find that runway. (suspenseful orchestral music) - 2,500 feet. Keep your descent. 2,000 feet and closing. - [Woman] Hey, Joe. - Mom, can we sprint okay? - Sure, but just one. Lunch is almost ready. (suspenseful orchestral music) - [Phil Voiceover] What will they say at the family reunion? He never reached out, only thought of himself. - [Bob Voiceover] Oh God, get me out of this. I'll get it right, I swear I will. My God, help me. Get me through this, please. Oh, God. (suspenseful orchestral music) (grunting) - Lower, still lower. More drag. - Going over. (grunting) (dramatic orchestral music) - [Lynn Voiceover] No. What better way? A child in her lap and her true love's at her side. I will see my baby again. I will. (crying) - [Pearl Voiceover] What have we done to Chris? What could his life have been? Dear God, take me. Spare my baby. - Look at that plane, would ya? - [Woman] Of course it's a plane. - Are they landing in that other air strip over there? That is one quiet plane, if you ask me. (suspenseful orchestral music) - [Maurice] Bear left. - Left, left side. Damn. Drop, babe. Drop, babe. (grunting) - Get these cars off the runway. That plane's coming down. Move it! Move it, drivers! Get these cars off the runway! (yelling) (engines revving) - What are all those people doing there? Look at all those people. - Jim! - Kid, kid! - Jim. Get down, get off the runway! Jim, get out of there. - There's a kid on the runway! - Get out of there! Jim, get off the runway! A plane! Get out! - Keep it steady. - Jim! - Love you, mom. Love you, dad. Contact. (tires screeching) (crying) (nose grinding) (screaming) Brakes, brakes! Brakes, right brake, right brake. Left brake, left brake. (screaming) Brakes! Brakes! (crying) More brakes, pound 'em. Come on, stop. Stop! (crying) (plane grinding) (heavy breathing) (suspenseful orchestral music) (electricity zapping) Smoke, smoke, we got a fire. We got a fire. - No, no. No. (suspenseful orchestral music) (electricity zapping) - Out of here, let's go. (seat belts releasing) (coughing) Fire extinguisher. We've gotta get this fire out. (all yelling) - [Man] The exit! (fire extinguisher spraying) - Get out of here. The smoke could be poisonous. Go! You too. - I'm gonna help. - Everybody, fire extinguishers. First aid, blankets, hurry! Hurry! - Need someone to catch the others. Go, go! (yelling) - Are you okay? - Feet first, go, go. - Wait. - Come on. - Smoke. - Okay, go, go. Come on, come on. - Feet first, go, down. - Come on, before you burn, come on! - Down, feet first. Go. First, straight to the bottom. (laughing) (fire extinguishers spraying) - Feet first. (coughing) (coughing) Straight to the bottom. - The extinguishers are dead. Let's get out of here. Come on, come on, come on. - Sir, feet first. Roll with the baby. It's okay, it's okay. Just, okay, here we go. Sir? Pearl, come on, go it's okay, feet first, go. - Hang on. - Okay, roll with him. (coughing) - Is that it? Bob, Maurice? - Maurice, straight back. - Come on back, let's go, come on! (coughing) Did you check every seat? - Yeah, let's go. Out! - Keep going, keep going. - Come on, Mo! (grunting) (coughing) - Bob's still inside. (coughing) (electricity zapping) (coughing) (extinguisher spraying) - Let's go. - [Rick] Give me a flashlight. (grunting) - [Maurice] Okay. (coughing) (electricity zapping) (coughing) - [Rick] Bob, are you there? - [Man] Come on, come on. (electricity zapping) - [Rick] Here he is. - [Maurice] Bob, Bob. Bob, Bob, are you all right? - [Rick] Is he breathing? - [Maurice] Bob, Bob, can you hear me? Bob? - [Al] What's keeping those emergency vehicles? (siren wailing) (dramatic orchestral music) - [Man] I see them, there they are! - [Larry] All right! (crowd clapping and cheering) (grand orchestral music) (coughing) - You did it, you did it. - Thank God, we're all right, Pearl. We're all right. - Passengers and crew? - A few minor injuries. Everybody's off the plane. Everybody's fine. - You're safe. You did it, you did it. - We did it, we did it. We don't wanna do it again, real quick. - No, we don't. (chuckling) (light orchestral music) (reporters chattering) (cameras clicking) - [Reporter] How's it feel to be home, sir? - Feels good to be home. (light orchestral music) (MultiCom Jingle)
