~--== McEphie ==--~ The prices of basic goods and services soar.. ...as the Philippine stock market remains in the red.. ...for the fifth consecutive month. The Philippines is just one epidemic away from total collapse. Your communities are very epidemic-prone... ...to communicable diseases such as dengue... The dengue vaccine is still being distributed... We are revising protocols in distributing vaccines in our barangays. There are around 200 patients every day... We can't accommodate everyone. The Department of Health reported more than 2000 cases... ...because of the highly contagious disease. Just don't... That's still summary execution. Student activists troop to Mendiola... The student activists... Students will walk out... Complaints concerning human rights abuses by people in government... What we need is discipline. If we all just follow orders, we can improve the situation. =Block Z= In the name of God, leave this body! In the name of God! Typhoon Zelda, with the international name "Henma", will enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility... ...within 24 hours. Another low pressure area is expected to enter... The epidemic is really severe. A lot of people are still not vaccinated. Good thing I didn't get infected when I was in Saudi. You were vaccinated, right? Our bloodline is strong. We don't get sick easily. I'll pick you up after your class. -Never mind, it's okay. -No, it's fine. I'm not busy later, anyway. I'm going home late. Aren't you going to meet with Uncle Jerry later? He mentioned that we have a project, but... He can be really hard to deal with sometimes. Dad, don't forget about my tuition. Didn't you tell me we can pay that late? This is the latest we can pay. The deadline was last month. The old Walrus Bar is closed already? Your mom and I used to go there a lot. I think your mom fell in love with me... ...because my eyes were always on her whenever I was singing. I even remember your grandfather. He was so mad at me. He'd always say... "How will you provide for your family if you're in a band?" You already told me that, Dad. PJ, you know that if I had the choice... ...I would've stayed here with you and your mom. If only I was here... If you were here, you would've been with Mom when she had a stroke. If you were here, I wouldn't have been alone when... Hey! This is what happens when people don't give way. Hey! Stop that! These kids are growing up to be pickpockets. I'll get off here. -I'll walk you there. -I have to print my paper. It's not safe here. -It's fine, Dad. -PJ. -I will wait for you. -Go ahead. PJ! ...five, six, seven, eight. Let's! U! Good morning, San Lazaro University! USC Vice Chairman Vanessa here! Let's make this a good semester, guys! And don't let the gloomy weather get you down! Last push before the summer break! Can you give a creature that's a zombie type? Zombie type? You can't go wrong with this one creature. If you summon it on the battlefield, it calls on several other zombies along with it. Nice, good thing you're already here. Please attend the rally. Good luck to the med students who will be taking the exam. You're on your way to becoming doctors! And congratulations to Block Z... ...for winning the basketball game against Block O! Shout out to team captain Lucas! You were amazing! Go, Block Z! Okay. Initial contact, you're all infected. Everyone near me has been exposed to the virus. And in a few moments, the virus will go through your bloodstream... ...and reach your brain. Once your brain is infected, you will die. Now, Troy. How can you avoid dying? I... I can... I can be immune. There can be mutations where some people are immune to the virus. It's like genetic lottery. Girl, no. I'm strong. Erika the virus is strong. In Africa, there's a small community of sex workers... that's asymptomatically immune to HIV. Their immune system has adapted to the constant exposure of the virus. It doesn't mean it's gonna kill them, but they can be carriers. So, it's possible that I can be immune too. Thank you. Thank you, Block Z seniors, for showing off. I'm impressed. Hey, you're late again. All right, go in. Okay. Hurry up. You're already late. Bebeth, good morning! I'll just get the record book. How are your kids? They're fine, Ipe. They're still healthy. How about your wife? Hasn't she left you yet? You're so mean. Anyway, I'll go ahead. All right. Go inside. Adobo. Where have you been? I've been looking for you. Are you hungry? We've been best friends since kinder, PJ. I know when you're avoiding a question. What? Why aren't you and Lucas together yet? He's coming. -Lucas! -PJ! -Hey. -Are you going out later? I still have to review for Jameson. God. You're such a nerd. Acads is life. That's why we're still single, Princess Joy. -Don't drag me down with you. -My full name? Really? Of course! You're both a princess and a joy. See? Well, anyway, what's the point of med school if we can't date other people, right? Obviously, to become a doctor and to help patients. Yes, I know that, but that's an incomplete answer, Lucas. You only get partial points for that. Guys, the point of medical school... Besides being a doctor, obviously. ...is to find a fellow future doctor that we'll marry. I mean, look around you, guys! I know, somewhere around San Lazaro University, there's a "Mr. Erika Martinez" waiting for me. He's a surgeon, I'm gonna be a cardiologist, and for sure, we'll meet as medical residents, and then he'll propose... ...during our medicine summit in Germany. And you're all invited to our wedding. What do you think? Why? Are you getting married soon? What? I'm just asking. Don't rush PJ. Peej, you made a promise to me, right? What promise? Guys! Block F. Oh, hey! It's Lucas. Hey, nerd. Good luck on our game next week, Block Z. PJ! Don't engage, guys! We're better than that. Hey, are you ready to lose? Block F sucks. -What did you say? -Block F midgets. Myles, he's not worth it! They started it! Just ignore them. -They started it! -Just ignore them. Education is a right! Roll back tuition fees! -Rise up! -SLU! Hey, guys, we're here to talk to the activists. This is your student council, hard at work. We're currently with Chancellor Brazal, Chairperson Gelo, and of course, me, Vice-chair Vanessa. We will never progress if we can't have good education! Roll back tuition fees! Your student assembly does not have a permit. Disperse now or face disciplinary action. It is our democratic right to protest against unfair policies! There are proper avenues for that! Raise your concerns to the student council! Guys, guys, guys, that's enough! As the council chairperson, I will speak to the chancellor. I'll be your voice to the administration. Gelo, you only became the chairperson because your father is a general! -Galzote, corrupt! -Galzote, murderer! And Vanessa, a vice-chair, acting like a social media celebrity! -That's right! -Hey! You're just jealous because I'm cute. Plus, I got everyone's vote, fair and square. Guys, time to go. I still have practice. -Take care! -What about our meet up later? -I'll pass. -Lucas! -Come on! -I'll be tired by then. How about you, Myles? Is it your treat? -What? -I'm broke. Why do I always have to treat you? Oh, my God, you're all so boring. I don't even know why we're friends. You know what? Let's just take a photo. Does it have to be my phone? Of course, so you'll have a picture of us. -I'll go ahead. -Lucas, join us before you go. Come here! Smile! Best group of Block Z! Hello, Jimmy? Hello, Jimmy! -Who's this? -Jimmy! -Mario here! -Hey, Mario! Your friend from construction! -In Riyadh! Remember me? -Yeah! Of course! Can I borrow money for my daughter's tuition? Sorry, I'm broke because of my hospital bills. You see, I have a lung disease. -How are you? -Is that so? I'm doing fine. Sorry, it's supposedly for PJ. What about you? How are your children doing? Good thing you're not having problems with them. I'm just strict. Hey! Mario! Are you all right? Mario! Damn it. Sir, you hit me! Were you even looking? You already saw me crossing, yet you still hit me. Just pay for this. What payment? I won't pay you! Police! Call the police! He doesn't want to pay. Why should I pay? -You hit me! -I'll get him treated! -Why are you blaming me? -Come on! I'll bring... Call the police! Damn it! Just come with me. No, just pay for this! What are you saying? I won't pay you. Just pay for this! But there's no damage. -There is! -Hey! You're blocking the way! He hit me! Come on! My goodness! You're such a bother! Hey! Put me down! I'll bring you to the hospital. Just put me down! Ouch! (SEE YOU GUYS AFTER PRACTICE) Captain! Stop flirting. Will you? Who's flirting? Is that PJ? Shut up. What now? -Come here! -What's with you? Pass the ball! Shoot! Team, gather around! -Come on, faster! -Coach! Sir, what happened? Please have him checked. He's in pain. Because you hit me! This way, sir. Ouch! Be careful. It hurts! Oh, God. It's gonna be a long day. Girl, we're used to it, right? At least, we don't have to take double shifts. And what do we have here? A patient who got bitten. Let's see. So, Angie was bitten on the leg 30 minutes ago. PJ, if you need something, just call me. Okay. Thank you, Jun. You know him? Take a deep breath. Inhale. Exhale. Are you a doctor, miss? Hello, I'm PJ. I'm a medical student training to become a doctor. But we can assist your mom. What's your name? Ruby. Where are the real doctors? Hey! Ruby, that's enough. Okay, please lie down. Careful. I'm removing this, okay? Don't worry, I'll be careful. Does it hurt? Just a bit. Don't worry. Ruby. My head is aching. Miss... Call the doctor! Mom? Mommy! Please help my mom! Mommy! Hurry up! PJ, set line! Faster! Call the resuscitation team, okay? Defibrillate before two minutes. Go! Check her airways. The patient is deteriorating. Still flatline, no response. Both pupils are fully dilated. She'll survive, I can do it. This has happened before. -PJ, enough. -I know what to do. This has happened before. Just a moment. PJ, that's enough. -I can do this, doctor! -Enough. PJ... She's gone. Write the report. Time of death: 4:06 PM. Take 10 minutes, then go back to work. I know it hurts to lose your mother. But always remember this. There's nothing more painful that can ever happen to you. You have to be strong. Ruby. Come with me. Do you want ice cream? Let's go. Do you have relatives? How about your father? Peej? PJ! Hey, where are you going? I didn't know you're on duty. Hello, uncle! Hey, is everything fine? Why are you here? I hit a kid. I brought him here for a free checkup, but I still had to pay for the X-ray. Seriously, when will this end? Peej, why don't we get some air first? Let's go. Sorry, uncle. PJ? Let's bring the corpse to the morgue. What's your plan after the shift? Grab some drinks, maybe? Erika wants to go. I might go to practice. Have you heard Block F losing the game badly last week? Yeah. I heard it from Lucas. Wanna bet? Block F will have a new player. Half-Filipino, Half-Jordanian. Gary... This is probably a malfunction. Gary! Gary! What's happening? Run! Hurry! One moment, sir. Gary? What happened to you? Gary? Gary, are you all right? Gary? Gary? Gary? Hey, Gary! Gary, are you okay? Gary? Come on! Let's go! There we go! Slain! Let's play, I need a support character. I'm out of internet credits. Then subscribe to a data promo. -Trust me, it's worth it. -He suddenly disappeared. Disappeared? How? I followed him to the corridor. Then, when I checked, he was gone. Maybe he escaped through the underground tunnel. Underground tunnel? Yeah! There was an underground tunnel when this campus was built. They say the priests used it to sneak out at night. Are we playing or are we gossiping? Hold it, here's my play. What's happening outside? What the...? Run! Hurry up! There were no abnormalities in the patient's blood samples. Just an increase in white blood cells that could point to minor infections. The causative agent could've traveled through the patient's muscle tissues... ...all the way to the brain, but it's too fast. The patient came in with a human bite. -A human bite? -A human bite. So we didn't have to check the patient's blood pressure anymore. The heart attack probably had nothing to do with the bite wound. The patient was already exhibiting symptoms of rabies. But you said the blood samples didn't show rabies. Yes, but the progression of the symptoms was too fast... Professor! Professor! The corpse! What happened, Myles? The... The dead patient, she came back to life. -Then she... -Our patient? She flatlined, Myles. Basketball isn't just a physical sport. We have to use our heads. If the enemy is aggressive, play defense. Watch out for your teammates. We're in this together. In case of a double team, you will go... Excuse me, nerds aren't allowed here. Hey! Hey, hey, hey! What's happening to you? Call for a medic! Bro, medic! Hey! Please don't! No! Get away from... Stop! Bro! Bro! Lucas! Ivan! Lucas! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Kimmy? Kimmy! Kimmy's dead! Chancellor? Chancellor, what are we supposed to do? I'll call my dad. He can send soldiers to help. No. Don't call him. Make the announcement. What's happening out there? Oh, shit! Peej, look! Attention, students! Attention, students! This is Chancellor Brazal. We have a campus-wide emergency. The campus is on lockdown. Please stay indoors and remain calm. I repeat. Please stay indoors and remain calm. Run. Run! What was that? Guys, help me with this door! -Guys! Guys! Let's go! -Hurry! Guys, faster! Erika! -Myles, help us! -Myles! Come on! -Give me that! -Here! Sir! This is all your fault. You should've... You should've just paid me so we could've gone home. How is this my fault? You weren't even limping earlier! If I had known you were a sham, I would've left you on the street. I just needed some money. Is someone there? -Stay back! -Hold on! Relax! We're not doing anything to you. Were you bitten? Show me your hands. Here. Your neck. Let me check your neck. What about him? He's been bitten! Don't come near him, or you'll become one of them! That's an illness? He's been with me for a while. Does this mean I'm infected too? From what I know, you have to get bitten to be infected. But don't go near him yet. We're still not sure how the infection spreads. It's my first time seeing this. Where are the other students? I'm looking for my daughter. Classes were supposed to be suspended, but there's still no announcement. If your daughter's lucky, she has already left the campus. Let's go! Let's go! This is it. Where will you go? I'll look for my daughter. -Okay. -You? To the faculty room. I'll find... ...my girlfriend. -Okay. -Take care. -I'm heading this way. -Got it. Why isn't she getting tired? What will we do now, Myles? What just happened? PJ? -Lucas? -That sounds like Lucas. -PJ? -Lucas! It's Lucas. Go, go, go. Wait! Okay, go. -Lucas! -PJ! Are you guys okay? We're okay. You? Are you okay? Yes, I managed to survive. How many of them did you see? A lot. Even my teammates were attacked. We have to leave this place now! Professor Jameson, we need to go! Professor? Sir? Myles... Oh, my God! Peej! Erika! Erika! Damn it! Erika! Shit! I killed Professor Jameson. I killed Professor Jameson. -I killed Professor... -Calm down, okay? You saved my life, okay? Guys. Guys! We can't stay here any longer. Where the heck is your father? -Hey! -Big bro! Big bro! Miss, stop! Go back! There's no way out there! Why won't you listen to me? Hey, kid! Kid! Who are you here with? No one? -I'm Bebeth. What's your name? -Ruby. Ruby? Okay. Come with me. I'll keep you safe. Miss, there's no way out back there! The gates are off limits! Do not come any closer! This school has been placed under quarantine! No one will be allowed to go out! We have our orders! This campus has been placed under lockdown! This university has been placed under quarantine... -...and we will open fire! -What do we do now? -Don't move! -We can't go out? Don't move! They're coming! Somebody help me, please! What the hell are those? Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Listen to me! Hold your fire! No! Don't panic! Ceasefire! Ceasefire! 5:00 AM? -That's too late, sir. -We're dealing with an emergency here. Do you have any idea what's happening here? Just remember, the helicopter can only carry two people. Shit, Gelo! Have you seen this? Don't be a coward! I'm sorry, sir. -I'm sorry. -Pull yourself together. Okay. 5:00 AM. Hospital deck. I won't be late. I'll see you, Dad. Gelo, was that your dad? Gelo, do you have a way out of this campus? We won't be able to leave until dawn. There's an emergency, so all the soldiers have been deployed. Just remember... We should be at the hospital rooftop by 5:00 AM. You know what? I'll message the councilors. I'm sure they can help us find a way to get... No! Don't you dare do that. We're here right now. The closest exits are the main gates. Peej, that's too far from here. Wait. Guys, you have to see this. Is that a recent video? Uploaded 20 minutes ago. Who was shooting? Why are they shooting innocent people? Okay, new plan. The rear exit is over here. No, no, no. That's way too far, Peej. We'll be safer if we pass through the buildings. That way, we'd have somewhere to hide in case there are lots of... ...those things. Guys, Vanessa just sent us a message. "Helicopter rescue at hospital roof, 5:00 AM." Oh, my God! Yes! Yes! No, no, no. The hospital is way over here. We're too far. But who knows how many people have already been infected out there? Let's pass through the gym. It's the nearest route going to the hospital. I just came from the gym. There's too many of them there! I've got it. The student council office. It's farther, but we can run there. After that is the church, which is the midpoint, and then, the library. After that, the pool. And then, the hospital. Four stops. We have enough time. We can make it. We can make it. Let's go. Come on. (Quadrangle 6:15:54 PM) You won't be able to go home until tomorrow. We're not allowed to leave the campus right now. I don't understand why those soldiers came here. Where are your parents, anyway? My mom was brought to the hospital. She just died today. Those people chasing after us, were they monsters? Aren't you afraid to die? Not if it means I'll get to be with Mom. Ruby, stay here. Stay here. Hey! Behind you! What's the matter with you? You almost killed me! No, I didn't! I'm a sharpshooter! I'm sorry, Gelo! I gave you a clear instruction, Vanessa! Why did you message the others? That escape plan was just for the two of us! I trusted you. (Student Council Wing 6:44:57 PM) Guys, guys. I don't understand you, Gelo! You have the resources! The others don't. You can help them! Those resources are only for me. And don't question me again, okay? Their problems aren't my problems. But we can't just leave them behind! If you want, we can ask the soldiers to rescue us first... ...then just come back for the others... Do you really think I'll still take you with me? I gave you a clear instruction, but you disobeyed me! I shouldn't have included you in my plans! Are you really that selfish, Gelo? You're in the position to help others! Shut up! You were elected by the people... ...because they trust you to do the right thing! We have a responsibility to them! Vanessa, I'm still talking to you! -We're not done talking... -I'm going out to help people... -...if you don't want to! -Shut up! Because you are just like your dad! I said shut up! Stay here. Guys, I think that's Vanessa. Come on, let's help her. Gelo? Guys... Guys, it's not what you think. What have you done? She was already bitten. You know what happens when you get bitten. Guys, I had to do it. Us too. With Professor Jameson. We had to kill him. We received Vanessa's message. We heard about the rooftop rescue before dawn. The hospital is far, but we have a plan. Gelo, it's safer if we're together. (Canteen 8:15:04 PM) Why are we here? We're safer here. The kid might be starving. Bebeth... All right, help me. We don't know how long we'll be stuck here. Quick! Are you sure? The owner might get mad at us. This is an emergency. We can't survive with an empty stomach. Bebeth... Not now, Ruby. -Bebeth. -Wait! This will do. That bastard Ipe was able to hide this here. Ice cream! Is she your daughter? No. I just saw her. Her name's Ruby. Hi, Ruby. I'm Mario. Where are your parents? I'm also looking for my daughter. Is she a student here? Yes, a medical student. I can't contact her. I'm also worried for my children. They're still young. How young? My 9-year-old son is always at the internet cafe. My daughter's 5. I hope her brother's taking care of her. The subscriber cannot be reached. Please try again later. What year is your daughter in? Fourth year. She still has her internship and board exams. She seems smart. She takes after her mom. We're not perfect parents, but we'll do everything for our children. I've been gone for too long. Now that I'm here, I'll make it up to her. Bebeth! Don't worry, Ruby. It's just a power outage. I don't think we're safe here. (Parking Lot 9:25:03 PM) Stand by, there's a lot of them. There's the church. One at a time. Don't make a sound. Myles, you go first. -Why me? -Go ahead. Hurry. Myles, I'll go with you. I'll go with you. Wait. Go, go, go. Wait. Hey! Gelo! Come on. Hurry! Let's go. Now. Hurry. Ivan? Lucas! -Come on! -Let's go! Hurry up! Hurry. That's Ivan. -There are so many, Lucas. -Ivan... Are we going to die here? No. No one's going to die. Can you crawl? Come on. -Are you okay? -Let's go. Are you okay? Lucas! (Church 9:48:08 PM) Guys, where are they? Is it just me or is everyone's network affected? Check yours. I don't have reception either. The internet is also down. What happened to them? Gosh, I can't connect to Facebook nor Twitter. Erika! Oh, my God, PJ! -Lucas! -PJ! Where were you? The parking lot. It's not a good idea. But we made it through. -Are you okay? -Were you bitten? Don't worry, it's from a glass shard. Are there people inside? -Let's go! -There's people inside! (OBSERVE SILENCE) -Open the door! Please! -Is someone there? -Open the door! -Please! Anyone there...? Oh, my gosh, guys. We're surrounded. The tools. Get the tools. What tools? Myles! PJ? PJ! PJ! Lucas, help! Guys, help! Lucas! Help! Help me! Myles! Erika! What's happening? Aim for the head, or they won't die. What will we do now? They're coming. Oh, my God. PJ! -Come inside. -Get inside! Dad? Dad! PJ! -You're here! -Peej. I've been looking all over for you. -Are you hurt? -No. -Were you bitten? -No. What are you doing here? Why didn't you go home? I couldn't just leave you. Good evening, sir. I'm Lucas. Weren't you the guy from earlier? Earlier? Yes. PJ was the friend I was looking for. You know each other? Are you really just friends? I thought you were looking for your girlfriend? He's my friend. This is Myles, Erika, Lucas... They're my friends. Friends, friends. Friends. -Friend. -Uncle. Ruby? Ruby, where are you? Ruby? Ruby, come here. Everything is fine. Are you all right? Guard, why is there a kid here? I have a name, it's Bebeth. This is Ruby. We tried that already. It won't work, there's no reception here. These kids are so arrogant, just because they go to an exclusive school. Hey! Is there anyone else here? What are you doing with that? It might help. "Maintain pressure..." When I woke up this morning, I didn't expect this would happen to us. You have beautiful eyes. You look good without glasses on. You're such a nerd. What's your eye glass prescription? -Ouch! -Stop moving. -Be gentle. -Want to do it yourself? -Just do it carefully. -Okay. How about this? Is this better? Sorry about earlier. It's okay, Lucas. You were just in shock. Ivan... I was there when he got bitten. He asked me for help. He called for me... ...but I ran away. If only I was brave enough... ...he would probably still be here. It's also my fault we got separated from Myles and Erika. Sorry. Sorry for being weak sometimes. Sorry. Lucas, you're not weak. We're all here right now... ...safe... ...because of you. So you don't need to apologize. I should actually be thanking you. What for? For being there for me. Guys, how did this happen? This morning, all I was worrying about was our game. -But now... -It's a virus. I can't think of anything else with a transmission rate that's this fast. It could be a new virus. Otherwise, we would've known about it. If this is new, there obviously isn't a cure yet. Unless it's an old virus that adapted. Do you remember the outreach program in our freshman year? The vaccinations in several neighborhoods. Anti-rabies. The infected are manifesting symptoms related to rabies. Aggression, dulled pain receptors, excess saliva... That explains why the rate of transmission is fast. All it takes is one bite, then it spreads quickly. Ruby! Why'd you wander off? Bebeth's been looking for you. There's a cat. Don't mind it. -There's a cat. -Yes. I know. We still have two stops before we get to the hospital. (Church 1:05:08 AM) We have time before the rescue team arrives. What did you say? We're bringing them along? Of course. You can't come with us. Why not? There's not enough room in the helicopter. There's only room for two people. It can't accommodate everyone. Come on, Gelo. Why didn't you tell us sooner? I thought there would be fewer of us before we reach the hospital. So you figured you could use us as your bodyguards? Then you'd just leave us to die? Gelo, I can't believe I voted for you. It would be more dangerous if we all go. They even brought a kid. -She'll slow us down. -We can't abandon Ruby. The guard and her companion... We don't need them. Gelo, they just saved our lives! Gelo, he's my father. We're not leaving anyone behind! Can't you understand? We can't save everyone. I'm sorry, but that's the truth. It's every man for himself. -We're in a state of emergency! -Yes, it's an emergency! And you want us to fend for ourselves? I can only bring one person with me. Are you all martyrs? Don't you want to survive? Bring the kid with you. I don't want to go with him. Ruby... I'm just wasting my time here... No one will be left behind. Gelo, you need us. It's dangerous to go to the hospital alone. And we need you because you have an escape plan. If we stick together, there's a greater chance of us surviving. If we help each other. Get ready. I know a way. There's a passageway to the library. Come on. Mommy! Mommy! Ruby! Mommy! Ruby! -Ruby! -No, no, no! -Let's go! -Gelo? Gelo! -Gelo? Gelo! -Gelo! Gelo, you bastard! Unlock this! -Gelo, you piece of shit! -Open the gate! -I also want to live! -PJ! -Gelo! -Hurry! They're coming! Let's go! Come on! Faster! Run, run! Faster! Myles! Myles! Myles! Myles! Erika! Back off, bitch! Come on, let's go! Hurry up! Hurry! (Dormitory 1:44:07 AM) Thank you, Erika, for saving me. You saved me first, Myles. Why did Ruby have to run? That was her mom. The one she ran to? She was our patient earlier. We should be at the library by now. That's the way to the hospital. Gelo left us.

We should be at the hospital by 5:00 AM... ...for the rescue. Dad! Peej! PJ! Peej! Mario! -Dad! -Uncle! -Uncle! -Mario! Mario, what's happening? -What are we supposed to do? -Just aim that gun! -Dad? -Mario! Is everyone okay? -Mario... -Oh, my God. Mario, you were bitten. Peej. Peej... He's already infected. PJ? PJ. PJ. The wound is shallow, the skin wasn't punctured. -We just need to wash it. -PJ! It's all right. We just have to wash it, Dad. Everything will be all right. -PJ! -PJ. -PJ, he's already infected! -He's fine. He's not infected. I can't let you die. -PJ, listen to me. -This can't be real. PJ, listen. We'll get you some help. I don't want anyone to get hurt. We all know there's no cure for this. -Are there bullets left? -What? No. -Shoot me. -Dad? -Mario, no. -Dad, no. -You're not yet... -What? -You'll wait for it? -No, Pa! -Shoot me now. -No, Pa! Don't do it. No! If you were in my shoes, I'd do this for you. I'm not a murderer, Mario! -Uncle, please. -Do it. -No! Please, no. -You have to survive. What? You'll wait for me to turn into one of them? Dad! Just do it now! -PJ. -Dad! If you don't have the guts, everyone will die. Do it! Don't kill him! No! Stop! Don't shoot him. Please don't kill him. Don't shoot him. Please... Don't shoot him. I can't see you die. -PJ... -Don't leave me. PJ... I'm sorry I was gone for too long. I hope somehow I made it up to you. She's my only child. Mario, I'm so sorry I couldn't do it. What will we do now? Let's lock him up. I'm sorry. -Sorry. -Princess Joy... -I'm sorry. -...listen to me. I'm sorry for everything. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You have to leave me here. -I love you so much, Dad. -PJ! -I'll come back. -PJ! Go ahead and leave! I love you, Pa. (Archives 3:42:04 AM) Where are we? We're in the dorm's basement. It's now a storage room. There's a way here to the pool. Are you okay? Be careful, Erika. Guys... ...something's bothering me. PJ said... ...that this is similar to rabies or a supervirus. I noticed that the infected... ...when I used the fire extinguisher... No! Lucas, no! Lucas! Lucas! Lucas! Lucas! Lucas, that's enough! That's enough! Let me go! You son of a bitch! Fight me! -Calm down! -Lucas... Lucas, calm down. Myles! Myles! Myles! Myles! Myles? This is nothing. You're gonna be okay. It's nothing. They're coming. They'll be here soon. Myles? Myles? We need to go. You guys go. -No! -I'll stay here. No. No, Myles, we can do this! We won't leave you alone. Sorry. Sorry. Lucas, please take care of them. Myles, we can still do this. When you get out... ...please tell my dad I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, Myles. You can do it. Listen to me. No. No No. There are four bullets left. Aim and shoot. Aim and shoot, got it? Tell me you understand. We should leave, let's go! Shit! Myles. Myles. -We have to leave. -Let's go! No, no no! No. Myles! Myles! Sorry. Sorry. Myles? Myles! Head to the pool, now! Go ahead, I won't die here! I still need to see my kids! Go, go, go! Come on. Hurry! Run! Oh, my God! Hydrophobia! Get in the pool! Will they jump into the water? No. They're afraid of the water. (Pool 4:10:09 AM) Bastards! What? Come here! You killed my friends! Come at me, you animals! Hydrophobia! Myles was right. What do we do now? It won't be long before the rescue arrives. I can't swim anymore, Lucas. Hold on to me. We're not gonna make it to the rescue. We'll make it. You guys will make it, PJ. Thank you for being my friends. Erika? Erika. Don't ever forget that I love you. Erika? Go, guys. I'll see Myles. No, Erika. No, don't do this. -Erika, please! -I'm so tired. Erika, stop! I'll be okay. Erika! Go now, please. Lucas, take care of PJ. -Please, Lucas. -Erika! Erika! Erika, no! Please, no! Erika! PJ, let's go! -Hurry! -Erika! Hurry! Hurry up! (Hospital 4:17:02 AM) Peej, get the cord! Quickly! Hurry! PJ! PJ! PJ! Let's go! Hurry! Run! Quickly! Shit! Go, go, go! Go, go, go! We can't stay here for long. What will we do if they break the door? (Hospital Rooftop 4:24:23 AM) Helipad. Helipad! Let me. -How about you? -I'll follow. One, two, three! Hurry up! Lucas! Come on. One more time. Hurry, hurry! Come on. Peej... PJ. -No. -PJ. PJ. We promised... ...no one's gonna die. -PJ. -No. You can make it, Lucas. I can't. No! -Please try. -PJ. You have to survive. We made a promise, no one's going to die. Okay? Lucas... -Go on! Go! -Lucas! Lucas! Lucas! Lucas! Lucas... Lucas... Lucas! Hey! Dad? Dad? PJ! You were bitten! You too. Genetic immunity. I was right. The rescue? What happened to the rescue? What happened? Where are the others? The rescue didn't come. We have to find another way to escape the campus. We need to get out of here. There are rumors about escape tunnels in San Lazaro... ...that were made during the Japanese occupation. I heard about that too. I've been doing construction for years now. If my guess is correct, the oldest foundation is here, in the church. Ruby saw something there. Get inside, quick! There! That's where Ruby saw it! -Dad. -Right there. Go! Hurry! Hurry! Gelo? He was bitten. How come you'll survive and I won't? -My dad didn't come. -Gelo... There was no rescue. If I'm not going to live... Gelo? No one else will. Gelo! Gelo! -PJ! -Gelo, stop! PJ, run! Hurry! Run! PJ, run! Dad! Dad! Dad! Hurry, Dad! Hurry! Don't leave me alone! Please, don't leave me! Please, no! Packing winds up to 250 kilometers per hour, Super Typhoon Zelda will hit the Philippines... ...in the coming hours. It is now known that the infected are afraid of water. The mysterious disease is sweeping the Philippines... ...at an astounding rate. Those infected are observed to be averse to water. With the approach of tropical cyclone Henma, locally known as Zelda, the super typhoon is set to enter the archipelago in a few hours. When it rains, evacuate the city. Flee to the islands. We're here. We can survive this. How the country will react is still unknown. God help the Philippines. There is hope. He's still alive. His leg's broken. Let's bring him with us.
