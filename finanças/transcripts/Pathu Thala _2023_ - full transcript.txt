A good day... And a pleasant start! Our honorable Chief Minister is determined to make Tamilnadu number one in India while initiating public welfare schemes. LONG LIVE BROTHER NAANJIL GUNASEKARAN LONG LIVE OUR BELOVED LEADER Health is wealth... The CM introduces a priceless vaccine scheme for the public. This scheme carries a noble title, "Health is wealth"... is a scheme that resonates with the present time. Am I or you who is the CM? - A scheme that's path-breaking... - You are the CM as of now. But you arrived late for the meeting. The corporation according to the CM's orders... How's the party functioning? The people call it a revolutionary party. Does the public also state it would only work with the support of my 14 MLAs? This Government feels proud to bring you the vaccine scheme. You have the authority to arrive late.- Honorable Deputy CM... I want him to speak a few words about the scheme. You are a fetching suck-up! - This scheme is for the public. - Shut up and leave. "Diagnose the disease and understand its seeds "Identify the cure and make sure it succeeds." Quoted the mighty Valluvar... and now our CM fulfilled the good deed! I will be a fan of his good schemes. If it's an evil scheme... I will be a good teacher to point out the mistake. Thank you one and all! I cordially invite our honorable Chief Minister... - That was a sharp speech, Chief. - To introduce Health is wealth scheme. LONG LIVE TAMILNADU CHIEF MINISTER, ARULMOZHI LONG LIVE CHIEF MINISTER Greetings to one and all.- They have set up people to praise. The opposition party claims that my brother Deputy CM and I have differences, which could explode into hostility is nothing but a rumor. His presence here proves that there are no differences between us. My opinions are like my brother's... My brother's are mine... Governance and party... In the past, we had to put up an act to gain power. But he is putting up an act after coming to power. I humbly request one and all. Thank you one and all! Hello!- Honorable CM... cancel the vaccine scheme immediately. Why? The rascals agreed to pay me 500 crores... but only paid me 50 crores. The scheme has been announced. If we cancel now, it'll bring a bad name to our party. They can only feel bad if there's a party left. Hello... Moron! I'll meet you after a shower, daddy. Shall I serve dinner?- What do you want? The balance amount should reach me by morning. - Listen... - You will get it! Malathi... CM is heading out with personal work. - Switch off back-end cameras. - Okay, sir. - Sir! - CM is heading out with personal work. - Please inform SO... - I've informed. Get lost! He has been calling and irritating me. Don't attend his calls. You will get your money. I can quickly size up honest men. How do I trust you, who became the CM by fluke? - You trust your 14 MLAs, right? - Don't... Don't play your political games with me. You will get your money. What is the CM saying? Nothing! - Tell me, dear. - Where are you headed? I'm out to tend to Naanjil's issue. I'll resolve it and return home. Since you became the CM, I never get to spend time with you. Okay, once this issue is resolved... you, me and Aradhana will go to an island. I promise. Okay? - Where? - It's a surprise! Why are you following that vehicle? Overtake from the left. Who is following us? Brother, I don't know! Take a right where the divider ends. They're surrounding us! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hit the brakes! - Has the CM returned? - Not yet, sir! - First, inform the SO. - Okay, sir. Hello?- Mic 1, 2... All mics standby! The CM has not returned, ma'am. What? Ma'am, the CM is missing. Yes, sir. I have informed them! [news]: Tamilnadu CM is missing! The Chief Minister of Tamilnadu has been missing since last night. State boundaries are sealed. Emergency situation in Tamilnadu. How did the CM head out without informing the security officer? I have asked CBI to investigate the case. Sir, I'm Inban. Sir, this spot is called, Uthandi Toll Gate. All CCTVs for 6.5 kilometers from here to Muthukadu were active. But the lights and CCTV from Muthukadu to the nearest village were switched off. The monitoring officer and the EB lineman both committed suicide this morning. Any political rivalry? Sir, the only political rivalry is Deputy CM, Naanjil Gunasekaran. CM's wife has filed a complaint that he has been torturing her husband. So the enemy is not from the opposition party. CM and CM's PA, both their phones are switched off, right? Yes, sir. Sir, from midnight to morning 06:00 a.m. 352 vehicles entered the toll gate and exit at Salavankuppam's camera. But CM's car and another SUV did not exit. When we crosschecked the SUV's plates, they were fake. I heard noises as four cars crashed. - The SUV's entry time? - 12:20 a.m. Early at 02:00 a.m., a man came asking for first aid to treat injuries. Did you hear the noise near or farther? - Sir, I heard it in the middle. - What do you mean? - Sir, in the middle! - Oh... When I enquired about the injury, he said he got cut by the metal plate. - How old was he? - Around 35-36 years old. Was he really hurt? No. He said his companion was hurt. When I asked for his name and phone number to print the bill... he said his name was Selvam. Sir, that was a fake phone number. I don't think it was Selvam. If you notice, my forehead has a mark. It's because I bow down to pray on the carpet. I saw the same mark on his forehead too. He must be a Muslim who prays five times a day. I, Karunakaran... as a Chief Minister of Tamilnadu... I will faithfully and conscientiously discharge my duties that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India as by law established that I will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India. Folks, as the pharmacist said... the suspect must've gone to one of the mosques in the city. I want all the CCTV footage from those spots in the Chennai radius, specifically all the mosques on highways. [reporters] Sir, if the missing CM returns would you resign from your position? The High Command will make that decision. - Sir, an urgent call. - Despite seniors, how did you become CM? I have an important call to attend. I'll talk to you folks later. [all] Sir, did you expect that you would become the CM? Greetings, AGR, this is Karunakaran speaking. Congratulations, Chief Minister. Without you and your support, this wouldn't have been possible. Thank you so much, AGR. I never expect gratitude. Neither have I spared who forget gratitude. I'm aware, AGR. Everyone out here is asking about the missing CM. Instead of shutting up, seven crore people end the voices of seven people. Everything will fall into place. Lead a good Government. It's impossible to shut up seven crore people... but shutting up seven voices will put things in place. - What did he mean? - He meant the media. Sir, sit down. - Sir... - Any clue matches? So far, no luck, sir. Thank you, sir. Hello... Sir... It's a 98% match! Sir, 98% match in Vizag. Bhairavan, time-track Vizag. - Dheeraj sir, how are you? - I'm fine! - Hope you got him? - I'm watching everything. You follow him. I'm coming to Vizag. - Greetings, brother. - Come on, sit down. - What do you like to have? - The usual order. - Beef fry? - Uh-no! As you eat, answer the questions. Selvam, tell me your real name. - Ameer! - Where were you on the 24th night? I was on my way to Nagari. Why were you on ECR if you were heading to Nagari? - I had to deliver in Pondicherry. - What were you delivering? Gutkha! (chewing Tobacco) Why did you switch number plates on the container? Sir, I can't legally deliver Gutkha. Hey, are you being sarcastic? Brother, is there a problem? Hey, it's nothing! They're known to me. Hey... who are you, people? Why are you troubling our brother? - Hey! - Get out! - Go! - Let me handle it. - Get out! I said, get out! - Hey! Shoot! - I said, shoot! - Inban! Idiot, I said, go! Go! Super performance! Now shall we go to the Police station? Can I wash my hands first? Inban, I want him alive! [Telugu song playing] We could not find Kareem Bhai. But we got his right hand! Ah... I will bring him to you. Brother, he doesn't seem to budge and give out information. He's not opening his mouth. Hey, show me his face. If you don't speak... do you think we can't take out, Kareem Bhai? You should be alive to take him out. Hey, Subbudu, burn him alive! You're going to die, damn it! Hey, Guna, this is Kareem Bhai. Where are you? Hey, talk to him. Ask him to come over here. Guna, are you able to hear me or not? Hey, talk to him. Talk!- Hey, Guna! Hello... Guna? - Damn you... talk! - Hello? Tell me, Bhai... Kota Rao is hiding out in Vijaynagar. Are you going to kill him, or shall I go? I will go! Kota is not in Vijaynagar... he's at Vizag airport, Terminal One. Flight number: 2344A1 I will take him out in no time. Hey, hit him with the fuel. How did he do it?

They would've not let the Police kill him. To escape the Police the only option left is to go to AGR. Who is AGR? Even St. George Fort would fear to step inside AGR's fort. Which party would come to power in Tamilnadu... is decided by AGR. I have spoken to them about you. Bhai, are you asking me to evade in fear? If a lit match goes off on the stick itself, it's useless. Going to AGR is the right move to prove it to the world. There's too much pressure from the Prime Minister's office. And there's no update from you. I already told you, sir... this case is not like the others. Are you getting any support from the local Government? The missing CM is from their party. That's the actual problem, sir. Excuse me, sir. Hello! Sir! How are you, Sakthi? - Hard thirteen months, uh? - Seriously, sir! Listen, Sakthi, like how you made Vizag Kareem bhai believe it would be best if you also made AGR believe. The answer to what happened to people who went up against AGR is still a mystery. To date, a total of eighty-four officials have gone missing. Out of which twenty-two are Police officials. All off the records! Before you get to AGR, you need to pass through characters. Sabari: He handles all the business transactions of AGR. Next is Singha: They call him AGR's Commander. He can handle ten people at once. Before you get to Sabari and Singha, you'll encounter another hurdle. Selvin! He's a psychopath! Hey! In Vizag, Kareem. In Mumbai, Ratna. In Bellary, Rayar. Only if you're part of these teams can you get to AGR's core team. You won Kareem's heart, that's why you can go there. I know, sir. Sir, do we have any other details on CM that went missing? People had forgotten the CM so did the party. Only we are on the run to find him. - Hi, Arasu. - Hi! - Gun shoot set up, okay? - All okay, sir. - Did they buy it? - Yes. - Good! - Encrypted phone, sir. Oh, thank you! Sakthi, you're entering into the biggest criminal den. So, you have to be very very careful. Sir! Can't you see the train? Drive faster! Driving like a tortoise. Drive! Ram the gate! Hey! Can't you hear me screaming or see the truck? - Why did you close the gate? - The train is about to arrive. The trucks should reach the harbour by 08:00 p.m. - Please hear me out. - Hey... this gun and I are conjoined twins. But the gun soars high. Do you want to try it? Do you want to? Scram! Is the driver half asleep and driving? Families are traveling on this train. AGR's trucks are passing. So, they stopped the train. Did we arrive at Nagercoil? I don't think we'll be moving anytime soon. Guys, come on, hurry up! Don't crawl like sloths. Drive faster. Hey, over here. Over here! You're looking for me. Get inside the car. - What's your name? - Pistol! Where are we going now? Wondering how I got the complaint letter against AGR you sent to the collector. Even a whiff of air can't get past me. One of the three sent this petition. If you wish to save yourself... before I finish counting to ten... confess to me who sent this petition. One... Ten!

What are the officers doing at the check posts? As it's a hindrance, while smuggling sand they took out the check posts themselves. Aren't you ashamed to say this? - Immediately install a new check post. - Yes, madam! Kuttaparai, what's this? Selvin, a new check post has been installed. What do I do? Shall I take it out? Do you even have to ask? Take it out! Take it out! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Madam, they broke the check post into pieces. - Are you serious? - Yes, madam. Had we been careless, they would've taken us out too. Do as you were told. - Greetings, ma'am. - Greetings. - Good morning, madam. - Good morning. As I said, we incurred a heavy loss. We incurred a loss of 8,85,000 rupees. Only this is left. Even this does not have a horn. Poongundran, why are you so happy about the loss to the Government? Are you working for the Government or AGR? I am working for the Government. But you need to be made aware of who the Government works for. Madam, what should I stop tomorrow? Hey, why is there a tall woman standing? What do we do now? Let me call Selvin! Selvin, first, we took out the check post. Then we took out the Jeep. Now the Thasildar is at the check post! What should I do? Shall I take her out too? Why are you silent? Come on, hurry up. I'm close. Come on, hurry up. He's not responding. You take her out. Madam... - Don't do it. - Are you kidding me? Why didn't you say so? Turn away! Turn away! Damn, you people! - Is this how you brake? - Who the hell are you? Why are you clothed while taking a bath? Aren't you women ashamed? Why the hell are you beating me up? - Beat him up. - Don't drown me. Hey, wait, open your mouth. Why is the temperature 102 degrees? You were fine when you went to work. What happened to you? Nothing, ma'am. A truck came as close as someone would kiss. That's it! And she's frightened. Did you say as close as a kiss? Ma, I had a close call with death. - That's what happened. - Are you serious? I stood on the road to stop the trucks smuggling mines. I thought they would turn around after seeing me. But they drove faster after seeing me. For a moment, I thought I was going to orphan you. I thought a superhero would appear and save me. Sadly no one came to save me. That's when I decided... If I run, it'll be humiliating. Losing respect is humiliating. Losing life would make it into history - What is important? - Why don't you say? Ma, history is important! See, the bell rang. Let me check who's at the door. - Call for Thasildar. - Oh, no... Madam, I warned you not to lock horns with AGR. Now his army has arrived at your doorstep. Why did I even come here today? You pretend to be ill. - I'll handle them. - Hey, wait, let me check. Wait up! What do you want? Please release the trucks you seized. I won't! May I know the reason? Poongundran...

No, we had only twenty tonnes on board. - Are you sure? - Yes! I'll submit a report at the court. We'll discuss it over there. Madam, they're telling the truth. There were only twenty tonnes on board. Sir, did you check thoroughly? I checked thoroughly. If you have a doubt, check for yourself. It's a digital report. There can't be foul play. Twenty trucks have permit receipts. Sir, I seized forty trucks! No, madam, it's twenty. I documented it on video. Please check them at your convenience. As it reached, Thasildar's office, forty trucks turned into twenty trucks. Had it been at the court... twenty trucks would've turned into garbage trucks. Why did you install check posts to capture garbage trucks? Or you wasted a Jeep? Would be the questions thrown at us. Madam, I'll relieve the trucks right away. She's not aware of authority.

I have a tough time handling the sea. How many deaths in your family because of AGR? Don't dig up old graves! During the Kumarikovil fight, not just your family, even my family, was affected. It's time to avenge their deaths. If AGR is the king of the land, you're the king of the sea. Enough fighting the fish. It's time to fight the crocodiles. The Government will abide by you. - What's all this? - Looks like TV and washing machine. Keeping in mind their situation... you have sent them TV, washing machine, etc. Please witness the happiness on their faces. - Thank you, father. - I'm just the source... but it's you who is handling it on the ground.

That's great! Sir, your protests were never self-reliant. You stood firm against the AGR for mine smuggling. But in vain. Aggregate people and protest, you will witness the result. Sir, if that's the case... we have to stage a protest against your quarries too. Sir, we may look defiant, But we always abide by the law. My four quarries are shut down. Thasildar is aware of it.

Now say it's not possible! Even now, it's not possible. - Bloody hell! - The train has already passed. - When? - Just a few moments ago. What happened, Singha? Selvin went to extract the money at Palliyadi gate. But the train had already passed. Pistol... Pistol, let's go! Pistol... Brake! Pistol... rope! What are you going to do? We are nearing the station. Why are they exchanging glances like lovers? Guna, wait, I'm coming. Hey, hold your horses! Why are you pounding on the door? Selvin... Where's your partner, Guna? - Huh? - He went out. How did the Police come to the railway station? - How do I know? - Whack him! - I swear, I don't know. - How did Guna know where to come? I brought him along because he's one of us. It's not like he was born to you. - Tell me! - A human monkey born to a human. But he has no tail, though. - Hey, I'm asking you. - Kutta... - To hell with Kutta... - Tell me, damn it! Who among you both is the informer? Is it you or him? You are the informer! Damn you, man. I'm going to whack you... Oh, no! Oh, God, no! Instead of going to the railway gate nearby, why did you go five kilometers away to Palliyadi gate? You wanted to give up the money to the Police. How much is your share? - Hey! - Hey! Hey, Selvin, Singha is calling. I said, Singha is calling! Look here! Singha... Tell me, Singha.- Where's Guna? I'm investigating him.- Give him the phone. What?- I said, give him the phone. Tell me, Singha. Ruby Fernandez is contesting against AGR's candidate. Follow him until the elections are over. Shall I bring Selvin as a company? No! You go alone. Give me the phone. Instead of breaking his nose, you're sassing him. He's bleeding me dry. Who is going to answer my mother-in-law? - Let's go to the blood bank. - Let go! - I'll whack you after transfusion. - Let go! [news] In the Kanyakumari Parliament By-elections against E Rajan of AMK party Kumari Fishermen Union, head Ruby Fernandez is contesting as an independent candidate. WE'LL PROTECT... PROTECT THE SAND WE'LL END... END ILLEGAL SAND MINING Did you invite the media? No one has gathered. If we call to protest against AGR, we get threatened. - What can the media do? - Bloody hell! Buy off people and gather the crowd. WE'LL PROTECT... PROTECT THE SAND WE'LL END... END ILLEGAL SAND MINING [reporters]: The protest that started mellow has become raging. This huge crowd is the proof. Who are these people? Just one bomb, and the crowd will turn into sand. OUR EMBLEM IS BULL If AGR comes to know, he will bite our heads off like zombies from Walking Dead. Beloved people Ruby Fernandez is arriving now. You're venting your anger at the wrong place. WE WILL LAY OUR LIVES... FOR OUR LAND Our Chief Minister Karunakaran's favorite candidate, Rajan... I request him humbly to make the victory march. This earth does not just belong to us. It also belongs to the upcoming generations. If you destroy the resources, what would the upcoming generation do? If we lose a plant. We need plant a new one. If one flower withers and die. Another will bloom. If a tree falls. Another will grow. But if you destroy the earth that bears it all... Where will we stand? Where will we go? [man 1]: AGR is the reason for this chaos. [man 2]: Hey, everyone, calm down. ILLEGAL SAND MINER, AGR DOWN! DOWN! [news] Under the leadership of social activist, Udhayamurthy the low-key protest against AGR... has spread like fire across Kanyakumari... and turned into a huge protest against illegal sand mining. I never expected this protest to explode like this. I have an idea to dissolve this protest. - Shall I say? - Shut up! Sorry! Singha, before dawn, this protest will come to an end. Sir, the protest is growing large. Law and Order situation is going out of control. AGR will handle the Law and Order. You ask the SP to go on leave. Sir, I meant... Okay, sir! LONG LIVE RUBY FERNANDEZ People's protests won't go in vain. I'm contesting this election. I will definitely win. After I win I will fulfill all your demands. I need your support and votes. Whatever you need, please come to me. I'll take my leave. - Ruby... - Only after I met the people... I've gained confidence that I'll win. The crowd won't convert into votes. AGR may sacrifice anyone to win. You better be careful. People, AGR's men burned down the old age home. Oh, no, they destroyed our home. We are homeless now. They've burned it down. Oh, dear, God. What would we do now? They've burned down our house. Where would we go now? [news] Burning down old age home is inhumanity. As the residents took part in the protest... there have not been many casualties. Where will we go now? The AGR won't prosper! That man is hurt! Why are you pushing me away? First, he will send men to burn it down, then send you to put it out. - You better leave! - Send them away! [lady]: Oh, no, we are homeless! - Sir, what do we do now? - Where do we go? Oh, no, I'm stuck in the fire. Please, someone help! Oh, no! Am I visible to anyone outside? Please someone save me. Please save me! We did not expect this. Please have some tea. Oh, God, please come and see this. [woman sobbing] Oh, God, no! Oh, God, no! Oh, no! [bullet shot] [machine gun fire] [chopper whirring] The deceased old lady... arrived yesterday asking for shelter, Father. As I was in a hurry to join the protest, I did not enquire much about her. People who came looking for shelter at Nesakaram... turned into their graves. At the confluence of three oceans in Kanyakumari... every soul is aware of the reign of AG Ravana. The one who seeks power is limited to boundaries. But I am "The Power" with no limits! I did not rise to power conventionally. I romped my enemies and rose to power! There's no account of how many died by my hands. Neither there's an account of how many survived. AGR... Neither I'm a fool to beg you for my life. Nor are you a human to forgive me. You will die just as how you killed me. Wolf kills the Deer Panther kills the Wolf Tiger will kill the Panther The lion will kill the tiger.

Chief, are you scared that AGR survived? Or are you angry? The position of Deputy CM is holding me back from locking horns with AGR. I can prove my worth only if I throw away my posting. I will! - Who are these people? - I don't know! No one could dare overtake your car. I can't figure out which is our convoy. It all looks the same! What are they doing? - Why are the swerving? - They've surrounded us! Who are these people? - You're doomed! - Hey! Hey! "The force the strife demands, the force he owns, "the force of foes, the force of friends, "these should he weigh ere to the war he goes." Naanjil, do you know what this quote means? You know that it's essential to know your enemy's strength before you clash, and so do I. It's not enough that you know the meaning. You need to abide by it. The arrogance of power... has clouded you! Hey... I am arrogant! I'm from Royal lineage! I'm from the lineage that destroyed it. I will decide who will rule and who will fall. AGR! You're teasing me like I'm a wounded tiger. You should kill me! If you don't, then I'll kill you! [laughing loudly] - Singha... - Brother... Shall we play around with this wounded tiger? Let's watch what it does. Untie him! - What is it? - Water... You can't stay put in a place for ten minutes. Keep writing. AGR... [whispers] AGR! What is it? Look... [whispers] - Who? - It's you! - Me? - Mmm... Instead of studying, you've been fooling around. Shall I tell your mother? I dare you to speak to my mother. I thought as much. Aradhana! Hey, this is why you sent me away to get water? Focus on good things. Stop looking over there and do your homework. Why don't you contest in elections? I don't want to step into this drainage. That's why I keep away from politicians. Drainage always stinks. If there is no drainage, the entire city will stink. People can't make out the difference between the drainage and the sea. They speak behind me, saying I protested to contest for a title. So, you expect the people of Kanyakumari to stay enslaved to AGR for life. If you hesitate, no one else will come forward. - That's why I'm saying... - I'll contest! Sometimes you win. Sometimes you learn. Your wisdom to me. I will canvas for you. - Thank you, sir. - All the best, madam. Looks very strong. Bless you! - I'll take my leave. - Thank you, sir. Chief, it's atrocious that a young girl wants to contest in elections. And you gave the nod to her. Who knows? Things could happen as in Delhi. It's the age when officials are becoming politicians. I want AGR's candidate to lose. Do as I say! Come with me. Guna? Thanks! - For what? - For saving AGR. What is your name? My name... [whispers] Aradhana... - I can't hear you. - Aradhana... Aradhana! Isn't that CM's wife? She is AGR's sister. Come on. KAMBA RAMAYANAM When I see you... I get reminded of my beloved Ameer. He lived for me. He died for me. - Did my sister eat? - Yes, she ate. Only you care about her. - Never she asked about you... - Pandi Ma, please... Naajilar and Udhayamurthy have made the Thasildar girl, their candidate. As she's educated, the people favor her. Let's ask our candidate to go to school and get educated. If you could show your face to the public once - victory will follow us. - Rajan! To scare a mouse lion need not step out. Singha, the enemy, is making a smart move. That's why he chose a female candidate. One who's out to win will be more eager than the victor. Find the root of eagerness and snap it. Please eat! Eat! VOTE FOR! VOTE FOR! OUR SYMBOL... PEN! - Hello, Poongunran! - Hi, madam. How are you? By your grace, I've bought a new house and leading a happy life. By my grace? Since you resigned, the office has had a heavy money flow. So I booked a flat. I decided to appoint you as my PA when I become MP. Oh, God, madam... Please don't make that mistake. Don't appoint me as your PA even if you become the PM. Why? It's hard to get rid of good habits. My family will vote for you. My entire family will vote for you. Hey, little boy, vote for madam. OUR SYMBOL... PEN! VOTE FOR! VOTE FOR! OUR CANDIDATE... LEELA THOMSON What? Romance? Not bad... You still have a soft corner for me. There's no bloody soft corner. What do you want? - Why don't we talk? - Why should we talk? You're asking for the vote as a public representative. I am public too. But you're not ready to hear me out. Tell me, what do you have to say? I still love you! If I say it, you won't believe me. What if I say, "But I know you still love me." Are you here to say this? Lee... You're in a dangerous situation. Speak to Election Commission and demand security. If you want, I can help you. Do you think you can help me? What can you do? Would you speak to AGR and arrange for special security? - Lee, I'm being damn serious. - Thank you. I'm good! The file you asked for. [Aradhana] Uncle, to this side. To that side. On that side. The granite they're looking for is in our Jharkhand mines. I can get you a sample. You can even check for yourself. We don't mind! Move to the right. Move to the left. Jolly! Jolly! Now to the right. To the other side. The other side. Exactly, to that side. Jolly, yay! AGR! Come on, let's play with the drone. Guna uncle bought it for me. Give it to me. Come on, fly it. Come on, fly it! Let's go over there. Right, right. Left, left. Up, up. Down, down. Go inside the building. Go inside the building. Go to the other side. Go upstairs. Fly it to the terrace. To the other side. Bhagyaraj uncle look at the drone. Pandi ma, look at the drone. Guna uncle, fly it upstairs. Left, left! Go inside! Higher, higher! Don't go inside the store room. It's the store room! Oh, God, it went inside. Drone... It fell inside the room. I'll get the keys. - Here you go. - Hold this. You stay outside. There's too much dust inside. - I'll go and get it. - Okay! Are you still looking for it? Guna, uncle, what are you doing? Hey, check who is it? Hey, it's Samudhra! That's my mother. Mom! AGR! AGR! - What is it? - Take a look. Where did you find it? The drone flew and fell inside the store room. Guna uncle found it while looking for the drone. Do you recognize who it is? This is me, and this is your mother. Say, it's your sister. I was not even born back then. Shall I keep it with me? Please... Will you kiss me? Come closer. Let's frame the picture and hang it. Go ahead! Come. Shall I tell mom that I found the sketch? - Go ahead. - Mom! [song playing on radio] [rain drops pattering] [mobile phone rings] - Who's on the phone? - Selvin! Switch on the Bluetooth. - Singha... - Yeah! We were looking for the mole in our gang, right? I found who he is. Who is it?- Wait until dawn. I'll prove it with evidence. We will hack him into pieces. Hello? Selvin? [voice on radio] Who is the Black Sheep? [mobile phone ringing] Hello...- I'm calling from the Mechanic shop. Your Jeep is fixed. Are you coming to pick it up? - I'm about to shut shop. - I'm coming! - Here you go! - Okay, sir. Who is he looking for? Oh, shit! Pen drive... I caught him! Oh, damn! - Who is it, Singha? - I don't know. Hey, Selvin! Hey, who killed you? Wake up! Wake up, Selvin! Guna was looking for Selvin. He must've killed Selvin. Guna came down to kill someone else. Thank God the buck stopped with Selvin. Did you summon me? - Did you eat? - Yes, I ate! - How many cars do you maintain? - 120 cars! - How many run for travel? - 40 cars. - How many cars do you own? - Nine cars. - All nine are regularly operating? - Yes, they are. Oh, no, one car got stolen. I have filed a complaint with the police. - When? - Two days ago. How did the stolen car appear on the church road last night? I think the thief drove it himself. Guna and Pistol are staying at our house on church road. Guna and Selvin often clashed with each other. [police officer] Thangamani, when did your car go missing? It should not matter to you. I need an FIR stating it went missing on the 21st. The new inspector is very strict. Perhaps, I can try speaking to him... Sir, I took care of the inspector long ago. He's on vacation with his family. What is your demand? Brother, please forgive me. [PC] Can you get my son a job in AGR's company? Sir, my word is as good as AGR's word. Hang up! Had we spared him, he would've made a fool of us like Guna. So you believe that Guna killed Selvin? Isn't that the truth? Guna! Last night Guna came to me. I saw the truth in his eyes. Guna did not kill Selvin. That person is hiding as one among us. Compensate the driver's family. [Kutta groaning loudly] Hey, Kutta, what happened? I thought I'd get Guna alone and finish him. But he gets lucky all the time. I want to kill him right away. During these times, great people only say one thing... Let it go. We'll handle it! Only fools would say such things. Let it go. We'll handle it! Selvin was holding the pen drive in his right hand. Shit! How did I miss it? [news] In the recent Kanyakumari Parliament By-election... candidate E Rajan of AMK party won on a massive scale. Independent candidate Leela Thomson who contested against him lost losing the deposit. We will be the first to feel sad about the victory of our candidate. If we win on the first attempt, there's no difference between the politicians and us. The public doesn't quickly agree for good to happen. - Who brought people for the protest? - Me! - From where did you bring them? - Thiruvananthapuram. How do those people have the right to vote in Kanyakumari? A total of 10,60,200 votes. Only 200 voted for us. Then why did we pay the people who did not have the right to vote? He's alone and desperate. Go and give him company. Okay. Even NOTA received 4500 votes. Who the hell is AGR? People with heavy hearts... please come to me. I will provide you with solace. What Jesus once quoted is happening in reality. Sakthi, the details you sent are of Norway's TNB bank transaction. Tell him about Global Bliss. Yeah... account holder name, Global Bliss. There have been many fund transfers to Indian Trusts from Global Bliss. Agreed that love can't be bought. But to buy a product... you have to pay the price. And we need money for it. To needy and abandoned people like us... the God helps us in some form or the other. When we routed the transactions... we have come to know that AGR's Samudhra minerals and Global Bliss are partners. You believe that Global Bliss in Norway has been funding Nesakaram. But its founder is none but AGR. No one is aware of it. When Nesakaram burned down... before Udhayamurthy reached out to me AGR called. He did not want you people to suffer... so within a week, he spoke to Manikandan bought this building for one crore and gave it to us. But you believe AGR demolished Nesakaram. Even he is aware of it. Last year's profit from Global Bliss is 300 crores. The entire profit was only used for charity. Not just in this country... he has given life to fifteen lakh senior citizens and orphans across the world. He sponsors education for two crore students. You don't have to bless him but don't criticize him. AGR, it's high time the truth was told. I regret to have cursed you. We never knew you were the one who kept us all alive. - I'm your sinner. - Please don't cry. You're like my mother. You should live longer, my dear! Please don't make me cry. Only now do I understand why we lost with just 200 votes. When you're out to help people, why do you see the land as your enemy? Who told you that I see a difference between people and the land? Why don't you stop illegal sand mining if that's the case? I will stop... Can you guarantee that no one else will carry out illegal sand mining? I thought as much! Because one has to mine and the other has to protest... and another will use this for political gain. That's the current situation. I know mining sand is equal to hurting my mother. Let her children reap the benefits. If an outsider stepped in, they would leave them all starved. You need a bad identity to do good for the people. Let it be my identity. I admire your courage. Keep doing what you do best. I'd do best only if I had work to do. - Ask everyone to eat. - Sure, AGR! ♪ When the whole town is watching ♪ ♪ He will stand in the field ♪ ♪ When the soldiers live with smiles ♪ ♪ He will take all the wounds ♪ ♪ The fact that many elephants gathered to slander you ♪ ♪ Is proof that you are a lion ♪ ♪ Isn't the sky enough? ♪ ♪ A bird looked at the mirror of river And its heart was filled ♪ ♪ The thirst of an ant That cannot be quenched by an ocean ♪ ♪ Can be quenched by A dew drop dancing on the leaf ♪ ♪ Even if you share the fire He who lives as a twin ♪ ♪ Is also like a fire ♪ ♪ Isn't the sky enough? ♪ ♪ A bird looked at the mirror of river And its heart was filled ♪ ♪ The thirst of an ant That cannot be quenched by an ocean ♪ ♪ Can be quenched by A dew drop dancing on the leaf ♪ For me? ♪ Processions in the chariot of the universe ♪ ♪ But tell me, how does it matter Who owns the chariot? ♪ ♪ Like the rainy breeze And the deer fawn ♪ ♪ Man lives on the earth without self ♪ ♪ You may imprison the flower of your garden ♪ Hey, how dare you take the wicket of AGR? - Hey! - I won't spare you guys! - Get lost! - Oh, no! ♪ Isn't the sky enough? ♪ ♪ A bird looked at the mirror of river And its heart was filled ♪ ♪ The thirst of an ant That cannot be quenched by an ocean ♪ ♪ Can be quenched by A dew drop dancing on the leaf ♪ Brother, when are you getting married?

How many quarries do we own? We own 145 quarries. How many are registered under your name? - Thirteen! - Oh... Did we register anything under your wife's name? No! There's one quarry in Andhra registered under the name of S. Mahalakshmi. Isn't that your wife's name? Son, my father-in-law is in the mining business too. Whatever he buys, he registers under my wife's name. Oh... Oh... Why did your father-in-law add Naanjlar's wife as a partner? Here's the deed of your wife and Naanjlar's wife's partnership. Do you have any hand in the attempt to kill me during the festival? Son, I would never do that to you. Why did you kill Selvin? - Singha... - Yeah! We were looking for the mole in our gang, right? I found who he is. The camera near the church captured you and driver Thangamani. You struck a deal of a 10% commission with the vigilance to give up our money that arrived on the train. Do you think I won't figure it out when you slit the driver in front of me? Did I not pay you enough? This is the deed for the wealth I bought under your daughters' names. Son... please forgive... Don't ask for forgiveness. I may need to remember the least good you did. Guna, you need to enjoy the death of a traitor. Guna, you were worried about losing it. Here you go! Pistol, did you check the files on this pen drive? Pistol, I'm speaking to you. Yeah, I did check. That means you know who I am. I know. Then why did you not go to AGR? I gave it to you, and you bought me biryani. But AGR would not have bought me biryani. He came to supply weapons but stayed with us. I'm talking to you seriously. Hello!- Is Pistol over there? He's having his meal. - Do you have a gun on you? - I do. Why? Once he finishes his meal, kill him. This is AGR's order. Hey, Singha... Hello? Hello? - Pistol! - What is it? What did you do wrong? Why did they ask me to kill you? Did they ask you to kill me? Singha says AGR gave the orders. When I enquired he's not giving me a reason. - Pistol... - Kannan Ponnaiah, sir! Inspector, CB-CID special task. Erode Division. I know that you're IPS Sakthivel from CBI. Now you'll know why I was supporting you. Like you, I'm here to find out about missing CM. Oh... shit! I may not have found the CM. But I'm happy that I was able to save you. That's enough. I'm ready. Shoot me, sir. Pistol, more than finding the missing person it's important to save you from dying. Just wait! Let me think. Sir, there's nothing to think about. No matter where I go, they won't spare me. It's more prideful to die in the line of duty than to return a loser. Inspector Kannan Ponnaiah died a brave officer. That should get recorded in the department. That's a proud moment for me. I... I can't do that. Sir, to infiltrate AGR's gang... and finding the truth is not an easy task. Sir, you're close now. The only trump card we have is CM's wife. Target her. Make her talk. We'll find the truth. Sir, don't let me die at a criminal's hand. Hold it, sir. You will win. Let me be a part of your victory. Go ahead, sir! I'm ready, sir. Betrayal and traitor... is not new to AGR. [rain pattering] First, he destroyed my political career. Now, he has destroyed your political career too. [news] Naanjil Gunasekaran is dismissed from the post of Deputy CM. The CM has taken action against him as he broke the rules. High Command dismissed him. Do you think he will make him the CM? - No, he will make him the PM. - Brother! First, he was removed from the party. Now he has been dismissed as Deputy CM. Now only the post of MLA is left to savor. Even that will be gone during the upcoming legislative election. We can't let this slide. We have to do something. What did we gain when he was a Deputy CM? He swindled everything. They say AGR snatched his position. Why would he stoop down to his level? He's a nobody compared to AGR. Chief... [man groaning] Bloody low life. [crowd sloganeering]: LONG LIVE AGR As usual, AGR is not celebrating his birthday this year too. I hope you hear me. Please leave. We are here to celebrate our God's birthday. Please let us see him once and we will leave. He is not in town. If he's away, then tell us where he is. We will go and meet him. [overlapping agreement] Anyway, he has to return. We will meet him when he returns. AGR gifted this wheelchair. If I can't meet him I'll throw it away. We won't leave without meeting him. Everyone sit down. Guna uncle, come with me. - Come with me... - Where? Come with me. Who is this? You tell me. This is mom and uncle. I made this gift for my uncle. It's good! Go and give it to him. No, uncle will become sad. Then why did you make it? Only now, I realized. On your birthday you should be happy. You should not be sad. Brother... Brother, to celebrate your birthday... the entire town has gathered at the gate. You look at them and wave your hand. They will greet you and leave. A birthday without my sister's wishes... It is not a birthday at all. Listen, one minute. Today is your brother's birthday. I'm sure you're aware. People come to wish him from far off. They are not even related to him. They are hell-bent on meeting him. But your brother only considers it his birthday with his sister's wishes. The siblings are bound to be the same. You stay under the same roof... but enquire others about each other. There's nothing worse than speaking to his niece, fearing his sister. Your brother is a support to the orphans all over... but lives as an orphan in his own house. Your brother fights and seeks justice for strangers... How could he betray you... Mind your own business. Do you understand? Pandi, ma! It's raining. Please bring me an umbrella. Hurry up! The statue will dissolve. Hurry up! Happy birthday, brother. Huh! They're talking. [whispers] The people are waiting for you. Please go and meet him. What took you so long? Let's not disturb them. Come on, let's go. I know that you are aware I killed your husband. Why did I kill him? You could've asked me. He may have done wrong... Was it imperative to kill him? It was a grave mistake. A huge mistake. Your brother would never kill someone in vain. Don't you know it? Your husband would've killed millions. For the greed of money. Don't we have enough? Our family is very generous. Come on, tell me. He was a black sheep in our family.

A few outside the house and a few inside the house. But only you... Ask me what you want. You do right by everyone. But I feel you were wrong in your sister's matter. We can't always make the right decisions. When my sister got into a relationship, he was an ordinary MLA. But I made him a CM and got him married to my sister. Sotorio Pharmaceuticals, Africa. Check on YouTube. Ten years ago the pharmaceutical company... collaborated with the African government and introduced a free vaccination scheme for the people. People were eager and took the vaccination. In four years, an epidemic hit the nation. Everyone, from kids to older people, were affected by unidentified diseases. A few were bleeding. On witnessing the blood the press reported it as unstained blood on the cross. It is a developing nation. So their voice was never heard. The Ex-CM joined hands with such a company that makes money from creating new diseases. Same company. Same scheme. But changed the name. Bloody bloodhounds. Brother-in-law, don't you forget that I'm the CM. I did not forget that you're the CM. But the CM has forgotten the people. I asked you not to permit the pharmaceutical company. But you did not keep your word. It's not fair. I can't dance to your tunes because I'm married to your sister. Hey, call the commissioner. Okay! This life, the position, everything is your charity. How can you... Hey! Chief! Brother, your sister... Mom, where is dad? What I spoke, killing her husband... my sister came to know about it. Despite knowing it all, my sister did not question me and that killed me alive. To do a good deed, a bad identity is needed. Brother, please rest. Sakthi, is the information I gave enough? Singha told me... he could not extract any information on you before you joined Kareem Bhai. If one can't find any details about a person that means something is fishy. Sakthi was born in Mettur and studied at Bhavani High School. He went to Sairam College in Chennai. There you and Leela Thomson were in a relationship and broke up. Brother... [shot fired] [Guna groans] Guna! Guna... Guna! - Brother! - Hey! Damn it! Singha... pass me the gun! Brother... Many people work for me. A few inside the house and a few outside the house. But only you... Guna! [shot fired] Singha... something is not right at the gate. He saw us. Don't we need to see him? - How many men do we have? - We have ten bodyguards. Also, we have Kuttappa and his team. Let's fight! - Brother! - Mom! Samudhara! Aradhana! - Mom! - Brother! Mom! Come on! Mom! Uncle! - Brother... - Uncle! - Hey! - Uncle! Uncle! - Mom! - Aradhana!
