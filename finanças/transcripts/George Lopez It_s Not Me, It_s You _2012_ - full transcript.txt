YOU MAY BE ASKING YOURSELF AT HOME, WHAT KIND OF AN AMERICAN CAN SELL 7,000 TICKETS? YOU KNOW WHAT KIND, MOTHERFUCKERS? A MEXICAN AMERICAN. [CHEERING] I LOVE IT, BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE US WORK ALL DAY FOR FREE. [LAUGHTER] "MOVE YOU FEE. MOVE YOU FEE," BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO. WE WORK. LATINOS... FROM THE TIME WE'RE BORN, THE MINUTE WE COME OUT OF THE WOMB... "CUT MY CORD, I GOT TO GO TO WORK. "CUT MY CORD. I DON'T HAVE A VACATION DAY. I WAS JUST BORN. CUT MY CORD!" WE WORK. WE DON'T WANT TO BE BOTHERED. WE DON'T WANT TO TALK. WE JUST WANT TO WORK. "WHAT TIME DO YOU CLOSE?" "OH, QUE LA CHINGADA..." "WHAT TIME DO YOU CLOSE?" "MIRA, CABRONA, NO CLOSE." WE'RE NOT CONCERNED WITH SAFETY--THE LATINO. WE DON'T WEAR GOGGLES. WE DON'T WEAR ELBOW PADS, WE JUST FUCKING WORK. WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THE LITTLE CAUTION SIGNS--YOU'VE SEEN THEM. "CAUTION," UNDERNEATH, "PELYGRO." "PELYGRO? HMM." WE DON'T HAVE THOSE SIGNS WHEN WE WORK, BECAUSE WE'VE TAKEN THEM HOME... AND WE'RE USING THEM AS SOCCER GOAL POSTS. "PEGA LA PELOTA CABRóN." "CHINGALE G EY." "CHINGA SU MADRE." "PEGA AL HOMBRE." WE JUST ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A WET FLOOR... IT'S NOT ME. IT'S YOU. WE ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A WET FLOOR AND A DRY FLOOR. WE KNOW, SO WHEN YOU FALL, THERE'S NO SYMPATHY. [BANG] "MIRA, CABRONA, ESTA WET." "MIRA, ES CHINY. "CHINY, ES WET. "DRY ES DRY, PERO CHINY... ES MOJADO--WET." COMO SE DICE "PELYGRO"? "ES WET. MIRA, CABRONA, COMO LA PANOCHA--WET." [CHEERING] "AND DRY. "WET, COMO LA PANOCHA... AND DRY." EVERYBODY! WET... Audience: WET... AND DRY... Audience: AND DRY. Audience: WET AND DRY. [CHEERING] TONIGHT IS A CELEBRATION OF BEING LATINO IN THIS GREAT COUNTRY, THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERING] WE LOVE THIS COUNTRY! WE GET BLAMED FOR A LOT OF SHIT, BUT WE STILL LOVE-- THERE'S A FUCKING FLY THAT'S COMING THAT THEY SAY IS A MEXICAN FLY. HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU TELL? DOES HE BUZZ QUITE-- [BUZZ] [BUZZ] YOU LOOK THROUGH THE MICROSCOPE--"THIS FLY HAS A WIFE BEATER AND A TATTOO ON HIS NECK." "HE TOLD--HE CALLED ME A PUTO. HEY, FLY." WE GET BLAMED FOR SO MUCH SHIT, AND WE TAKE IT. I'M TELLING YOU TONIGHT, WE DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THAT SHIT ANYMORE. IT'S OUR TIME. [CHEERING] WE DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THAT SHIT. WHEN THE SWINE FLU FIRST STARTED, THEY CALLED IT THE MEXICAN FLU, AND EVEN MEXICANS WERE LIKE, "YEAH, THAT'S PROLLY US." "THAT'S PROLLY US BECAUSE WE LIKE PORK." MIRA, ASí COMIENZA, MIRA. ESTA COMIENDO CARNITAS... CHICHARRONES CON CHILE, LIMóN... TRIPAS, MENUDO, UNA PATA DE-- [SLURPING SOUND] AND... ASí COMIENZA, YOU GET PORK ON YOUR HAND, COMO EL ACEITE--THE OIL, Y LUEGO HACES PIPí. NOW, YOU TOUCH YOURSELF, Y YA TIENES PEE AND PORK--LOS DOS. LIKE A GLUE. COMO UNA GOMA. LIKE A GLUE, AND THEN YOU TOUCH YOUR EYE, Y YA. YA ESTAS INFECTED CON SWINE. YA ESTAS LLENO DE SWINE. THEN YOU GO TO WORK AND SHAKE HANDS WITH A NEGRO, "HEY, BROTHER. WHAT'S HAPPENING?" [POOF] AND HE TAKES IT TO THE NEGRO WORLD. THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT N1H1-- ONE NEGRO AND ONE HISPANIC. [CHEERING] SHOUT! TONIGHT... FUCK IT, LET'S ALL BE LATINO TONIGHT. TONIGHT WE'RE ALL LATINOS! [CHEERING] WAIT. HANG ON. WAIT A MINUTE. "MY TRUCK IS ALMOST PAID OFF. I WILL NOT--" "I DON'T WANT TO BE LATINO, I HAVE TWO MORE PAYMENTS. "I CANNOT GET BEHIND ON MY CHILD SUPPORT. I WILL NOT." LOOK AT ALL THE GIRLS. "I WANT TO BE LATINO. I WANT TO WEAR A BATHING SUIT." TONIGHT... LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. LATINAS ARE UNBELIEVABLY BEAUTIFUL. EXOTIC... CHICHONAS... NALGONAS... TETONAS... CABRONAS... ALL THE NAS. THAT'S WHY THEY CALL 'EM NANAS. CABRONA, CHICHONA--NANA! LATINAS ARE BEAUTIFUL. THE PROBLEM IS YOU GOT TO GET 'EM BEFORE THEY GET FAT. ABOUT 16 MONTHS--GRAB ONE. DON'T LET HER DRINK SODA. DON'T LET HER DRINK SODA. OR PLUCK HER EYEBROWS. WATCH HER, BECAUSE SHE WILL. BEAUTIFUL LATINAS. BEAUTIFUL. EXOTIC AND DARK. WE LAY IN THE SUN, WE GET DARKER. WE GET GOLD, WE GET ORANGE, COMO SNOOKI. I LOOK LIKE A CHICANO-- FUCKING SNOOKI. WE DON'T USE SUN BLOCK. WE JUST GET DARKER. FUCK IT. "WELL, WHAT KIND OF OIL DO YOU USE?" "WE USE THE OIL FROM OUR FACE." óRALE. "WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU NEED SOMETHING STRONGER?" "EL CULO." VáMONOS. BULLFROG. YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S TALK SHIT, SINCE WE'RE ALL LATINOS. LET'S TALK SHIT. BECAUSE, SERIOUSLY, THAT'S WHAT WE DO WHEN WE GET TOGETHER--WE TALK SHIT. EVEN IF YOU'RE IN THE CAR, YOU TALK SHIT BY YOURSELF. "LOOK AT THAT FUCKING PUTO." [HONK] "AAH!" SOME PEOPLE DON'T TALK SHIT. THEY TRY TO BE RESPECTFUL. "WELL, I WOULD SAY THAT SHE'S NOT MY CUP OF TEA." LATINOS, WE DON'T GIVE A FUCK--"I DON'T WANT THAT FUCKING BITCH IN MY HOUSE." "OYEME, CABRóN. "I DON'T WANT HER IN MY FUCKING HOUSE! "HER OR HER FUCKING DRUG-ADDICT FUCKING HUSBAND IN MY "FUCKING HOUSE! "AND THE KIDS, HALF OF THEM THEY TOOK AWAY--I DON'T WANT THE OTHER HALF IN MY FUCKING HOUSE!" "ARE YOU SAYING THAT SHE'S NOT YOUR CUP OF TEA?" "MIRA, CABRóN. I DON'T FUCKING DRINK TEA." "I DRINK PATRON WITH LEMONADE. ALL I KNOW! "Y MARIJUANA AND A VICODINE. ALL I KNOW! "Y ME CHINGO UN XANAX AND UN PROZAC TAMBIéN, Y-- "ALL I KNOW IS I DON'T WANT THEM IN MY FUCKING HOUSE. "LISTEN TO MY FACE. LISTEN TO MY FACE. "I DON'T WANT THEM-- LISTEN TO MY FACE! "I DON'T WANT THEM... IN MY FUCKING HOUSE." EVERYBODY. "I DON'T WANT THEM IN MY FUCKING HOUSE!" [CHEERING] LISTEN, WE--WE ARE SO PROUD-- LATINO PEOPLE--AND WE GROW UP THE HARD WAY. LISTEN, MY GRANDMOTHER WAS A RACIST, LA CABRONA... LIKE ALL YOUR GRANDMOTHERS. RACISTA. RACIST. ALL THE GIRLS KNOW. IF YOU'RE A GIRL, YOUR GRANDMOTHER WILL TELL YOU, "MIRA, CABRONA, CASATE CON UN NEGRO, AND YOU'RE DEAD. "TO ME, YOU'RE DEAD. "SI TE CASAS CON UN NEGRO, FORGET IT. "I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE YOU MY CHANGE. "GET OUT OF HERE, PORQUE ERES PUTA CABRONA, CON UN NEGRO-- GET OUT OF HERE!" MY GRANDMOTHER DIDN'T LIKE BLACK PEOPLE, AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, BLACK PEOPLE FUCKING DIDN'T LIKE HER. SHE WOULD SEE ME WALKING WITH MY TWO FRIENDS, AND THE LOOK OF DISGUST--AGH. "MIRA QUIéN VIENE, EARTH WIND AND FEO. "YOU'RE FEO! "YOU THINK YOU'RE EARTH. "CABRóN, LOOK AT HIM. PINCHE NEGRO." AND SHE WOULD TALK SHIT ABOUT HIM, BUT THEY HEARD NEGRO-- THEY WERE LIKE, "HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY." "MIRA, CABRóN, WHEN I'M AT WORK, NO ME GUSTAN LOS PINCHE NEGROS." "HEY!" "WHEN I'M AT WORK, NO ME GUSTA EL CHOCOLATE." "CHOCOLATE? WHAT? THE FUCKING M&Ms?" VERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE. LISTEN, THEY RAISE US TO BE TOUGH. THAT'S WHY OUR KIDS ARE NOT SPOILED. WE RAISE OUR KIDS TO BE TOUGH AND NOT SPOILED. OTHER PEOPLE RAISE THEIR KIDS--THEY ENTERTAIN THEM. THEIR JOB IS TO ENTERTAIN THEM. "WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO TODAY, COOPER? "DO YOU WANT TO GO TO COLOR ME MINE, GYMBOREE? "WANT TO SCOUR THE INTERNET FOR THINGS TO DO? HAVE YOU GOT A GROUPON ON YOUR IPHONE?" WE DON'T GIVE A FUCK. WE'RE NOT THERE TO ENTERTAIN OUR KIDS. THEY COME UP TO YOU, "I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO." "OH, YEAH? FIND YOUR TEETH." [BANG] THAT'S HOW WE RAISE THEM TOUGH, WITH VALUES. THAT'S HOW WE DO IT. OLD SCHOOL. WE RAISE THEM OLD SCHOOL, BUT NEW SCHOOL. WE TEACH THEM RIGHT NOW. RIGHT NOW! THEY'RE NOT GONNA GET SPOILED, LIKE ALL THESE OTHER LITTLE WHITE KIDS ARE ALL ENTITLED. THAT STUPID FUCKING LOOK ON THEIR FACE. AND THEY'RE ALL ON MEDICINE. ANY ONE OF THESE MOTHERFUCKERS IS ON MEDICINE. IT'S THE SAME SHIT WE HAD. WE WEREN'T ON MEDICINE, BECAUSE A FUCKING PUTAZO WAS AS GOOD AS A PILL. [BANG] "I'M FINE. YES. I'M FANTASTIC. "I WAS ACTING CRAZY, BUT SOMEHOW, NOW, I'M FANTASTIC. HIJO DE LA CHINGADA, THAT HURTS." ALL THESE KIDS HAVE CELL PHONES. WHO THE FUCK... ARE THEY GONNA CALL AT 7? "HI, IS THIS SPONGEBOB? OH, MY GOD. "IS THIS SPONGEBOB? OH, MY GOD. IS THIS SPONGEBOB? OH, MY GO--" WE DON'T GET OUR KIDS PHONES. ESPECIALLY NOT WHEN THEY'RE 8. AND THEY TRY TO ASK, "CAN I--CAN I GET A--CAN I GET A PHONE?" "¿PA' QUé, CABRóN?" AND GUILT DON'T WORK ON LATINO PARENTS... LIKE IT WORKS ON WHITE PARENTS. "WHAT IF THERE'S AN EMERGENCY?" "WHAT IF--WHAT IF THERE'S AN EMERGENCY AND YOU'RE NOT THERE?" "WELL, THEN, YOU'RE FUCKED." [CHEERING] AND THEN THEY GET MAD AT YOU--"IF THERE'S AN EMERGENCY "AND I'M NOT THERE, DON'T FUCKING COME RUNNING OVER HERE. "BECAUSE I GOT A WARRANT. "I'M NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE TALKING TO YOU. LOOK AT MY FUCKING ANKLE BRACELET." BEEP, BEEP, BEEP, BEEP, BEEP. WE DON'T TAKE THEM EVERYWHERE THEY GO. NOW, WHEN A BABY'S BORN THE PARENTS TAKE THEM. THEY GOT A BABY BJORN. GOT A PINCHE BABY CUELGANDO IN THE FRONT. "IS HE ALL RIGHT?" "YES, HE'S FINE." WE HAVE A RULE--YOU DON'T WALK, YOU DON'T GO. YOU EVER SEE A LITTLE CHOLITO DUDE TRYING TO UNDO A STROLLER? THE DUDE'S, LIKE, 18. HE'S GOT A BABY. HE'S LIKE, "FUCK." "HURRY UP!" "HOW THE FUCK DOES THIS THING--" "HURRY UP!" "AW, FUCK. I WANTED A BLOWJOB, BUT NO. I HAD TO FUCKING PUT IT IN, HUH?" NOW IF A PARENT HAS ONE KID... THE KID IS ON A LEASH. LIKE A FUCKING MONKEY TAIL HANGING OUT OF THEIR BACK. WE KNOW IT'S A LEASH. MY AUNT HAD 7 KIDS. WHEN SHE LEFT K-MART, SHE LEFT. SHE SAID, "I'M LEAVING." SHE DIDN'T EVEN LOOK BACK. "FUCK YOU GUYS." YOU SEE 7 KIDS-- "WAIT! WAIT! WAIT!" "I TOLD YOU I WAS LEAVING. FUCK YOU." DIFFERENT PEOPLE--LISTEN, THEY TRY TO MAKE IT SO SAFE FOR KIDS NOW. WHEN THEY HALLOWEEN--WHEN THEY GO TRICK-OR-TREATING... THEY DON'T EVEN GO AT NIGHT ANYMORE. LATINOS, WE WANT IT TO BE PITCH BLACK. WE DON'T WANT NOBODY TO SEE US, BECAUSE WE TRICK-OR-TREAT WELL INTO OUR EARLY 40s. "IS THAT A MAN?" "NO, I THINK THAT'S A WEREWOLF." "GACHATE, CABRóN, GACHATE." AND I LIVE IN ONE OF THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THEY BRING ALL THE POBRES-- ALL THE POOR KIDS. ALL THE BLACK AND LATINO KIDS, THEY BRING THEM TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE THEY GET BETTER CANDY AND THEY ANSWER THE DOOR. NOT LIKE IN LATINO HOUSES. [KNOCKING] [BARKING LIKE A DOG] "YOU WANT CANDY, COME AND GET IT." [BARKING] AAH! SO THEY BRING THEM TO A BETTER NEIGHBORHOOD, AND I TELL THE WOMEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, "THAT'S RACIST. THAT IS RACIAL PROFILING." "BITCH, IT AIN'T RACIAL PROFILING IF YOU GET IT RIGHT." "ONLY IF YOU GET IT WRONG." AND SHE GOES, "HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY'RE LATINOS?" I SAID, "YOU KNOW HOW? MIRA, CABRONA, LOOK. SEE MY LEMON TREE?" WAIT FOR ME. "SEE MY--SEE, ALL MY LEMONS ARE GONE. MEXICANS." "LOOK AT THIS, CLAMATO AND A CORONA. A CHELADA--MEXICANOS." "LOOK AT THIS, A HAIR." "HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT'S MEXICAN?" "BLOND WITH A BLACK ROOT?" CASE CLOSED. AND LITTLE LATINO KIDS, WHEN THEY KNOCK ON THE DOOR, THEY STICK THEIR HEAD IN THE HOUSE. BECAUSE THEY JUST WANT TO SEE SHIT ALL MATCHING. YOU KNOW? [KNOCKING] "AH, CABRóN, MIRA, ESTá BONITO. WOW. THEY HAVE PLANTS INSIDE!" AND WITH A ACCENT-- "TRIGA-TRING!" "I'M SORRY. I DON'T--I'M NOT--" "TRIGA-TRING!" "TRIGA-TREEN? "I DON'T--DO YOU WANT TO GO TO HOME DEPOT? I'M SORRY. I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING." ALL THE KIDS NOW, WHO ARE NON-LATINOS, TRICK-OR-TREAT AT 2:30 IN THE AFTERNOON, BECAUSE IT'S SAFE. THEY DON'T WEAR COSTUMES, SO THEY DON'T SCARE. THEY DON'T HAVE MASKS, THEY JUST HAVE A LITTLE MAKE-UP, AND AT 2:30, THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE. YOU HEAR-- [KNOCKING] YOU OPEN THE DOOR, THE SUN IS IN YOUR EYES. "TRICK OR TREAT!" "IT'S FUCKING 2:30. COME BACK WHEN IT'S DARK, PUTO." AND THERE'S ALWAYS THAT ONE KID THAT TALKS SHIT. HE COMES BACK, "I'M NOT A PUTO, I'M A PIRATE." WE... TEACH OUR KIDS WITH WORDS THAT DON'T GIVE THEM ANY DOUBT. WE RAISE OUR KIDS WITH DOUBT. THEY HAVE TO HAVE DOUBT. NOT EVERYTHING CAN GO THEIR WAY. OTHER KIDS, YOU TELL THEM, "I'M GOING TO DISNEY WORLD "FOR TWO WEEKS. HA!" WE RAISE OUR KIDS WITH WORDS LIKE SUPPOSE... AND ALMOST, SO THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS SURE. "DID YOU GUYS GO TO DISNEY WORLD?" "WE WERE SUPPOSED TO." "WE WERE SUPPOSED TO." "WE ALMOST WENT..." "BUT WE DIDN'T." THAT'S A BIG WORD WITH LATINOS--ALMOST. YOU HEAR IT EVERY TIME WE'RE IN THE CAR. WE'RE DRIVING, "FUCK, I ALMOST GOT A JOB RIGHT THERE." "I ALMOST FUCKED A GIRL THAT WORKED RIGHT THERE." "I WAS SUPPOSED TO, BUT I DIDN'T." "ALMOST." "SHE TOOK A PROZAC AND WENT TO SLEEP, LA CABRONA." WE DON'T DRESS LIKE OUR KIDS. THAT'S GAY. TO DRESS EXACTLY LIKE YOUR CHILD--SAME SHORTS, SAME SHIRT, SAME HAT, BACKPACK, FUCKING SHOES THAT LIGHT UP. TING, TING, TING, TING. WE DON'T DO THAT SHIT. IF A LATINO AND HIS SON ARE DRESSED ALIKE, THEY WORK AT THE SAME FUCKING PLACE. "CAN I SPEAK TO THE MANAGER?" "HANG ON. PAPI, TE QUIEREN EN FRENTE. "PAPI, COME TO THE FRONT, PLEASE. "PAPI, COME TO THE FRONT. "THERE'S A PVC HERE TO SEE YOU. A PVC." "WHAT'S THAT?" "UH, PINCHE VATO CULERO." "HUH?" GOOGLE THAT SHIT, MOTHERFUCKERS. WE'RE DIFF--LISTEN, AND WHEN THEY TEACH KIDS TO SWIM NOW, THEY GOT--THEY'RE NOT GONNA SWIM, BECAUSE THEY JUST FLOAT. THEY GOT WATER WINGS, AND A AIR VEST, AND SHOES SO THEY DON'T BURN THEIR FEET. US, WE'RE JUST PUT INTO THE WATER. [UNDERWATER BUBBLES] "KICK YOUR LEGS. YOU GOT IT. KICK YOUR LEGS. I'M RIGHT HERE." [UNDERWATER BUBBLES] AND YOU'RE UNDERWATER. [UNDERWATER BUBBLES] AND YOU CAN SEE YOUR FUCKING HOUSE THROUGH THE WATER, WITH PEOPLE PINCHE BAILANDO Y ASí. "I'M FUCKING DROWNING. THEY'RE HAVING A PARTY." [UNDERWATER BUBBLES] YOU GET TO THE EDGE. [HEAVY BREATHING] YOU GOT MOCOS AND SHIT FLYING. [HEAVY BREATHING] "I ALMOST DROWNED." "BUT YOU DIDN'T, DID YOU?" "ALL RIGHT, THAT'S HOW YOU LEARN. THAT'S HOW YOU LEARN!" "WITH SOME PELIGRO." WHEN A BABY'S GONNA BE BORN, WE DON'T BABY-PROOF THE HOUSE. LIKE OTHER PEOPLE, THEY PAINT. "IS IT A BOY OR A GIRL?" "IT'S A BOY. BLUE." "FANTASTIC." WE LEAVE THE HOUSE THE SAME. HOW THEY GONNA LEARN? WE DON'T ROUND OFF THE CORNERS... OR PUT PLASTIC PLUGS IN THE SOCKET. WE DON'T EVEN PUT PLASTIC PLUGS. WE DON'T EVEN GOT THE PLASTIC FRAME THAT GOES AROUND THE SOCKET. YOU CAN SEE INTO THE GARAGE. "OYE, TIO." "YO!" "COME IN--RIGHT HERE. THE FINGER. CAMBIALE." IF WE SEE A KID WALKING WITH A FORK, WE FOLLOW HIM. "WHERE YOU GOING?" "¿PA' DóNDE VAS? YOU'RE GONNA PUT IT IN THE HOLE? "PONLE, CABRóN. PONLE. NOT LIKE THAT. "PUT IT LIKE THAT... "SO YOU GET A BETTER CONNECTION, PONLE ASí. LOS DOS, TOGETHER." [PZZT] "YEAH, FUCKING TOUCH IT AGAIN." "TOUCH IT AGAIN!" OH, HERE COMES THE BROTHER WITH A BUTTER KNIFE. "TOCALE, CABRóN. LET ME TAKE THE BUTTER OFF SO YOU GET A BETTER CONNECTION." "PUT--PUT IT IN THERE--" [PZZT] "AY! FUCKING TWINS. LOS DOS." TO PUT A KID IN A CAR SEAT NOW, IT'S LIKE THE MOTHERFUCKER'S GOING TO THE MOON. IT USED TO JUST BE-- [BANG] NOW, YOU--YOU PUT HIM IN. [BANGING] WE--WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT SHIT. "IT'S LAST CALL. JUST LAY DOWN IN THE BACK." SOME PEOPLE DON'T DRINK IN FRONT OF THEIR KIDS. "MAS PUTO..." "MY--MY KIDS WILL NEVER SEE ME DRUNK, BECAUSE IT IS A BAD EXAMPLE TO SET, AND I DON'T LIKE IT." "HAZ...POQUE TORRE UN...CA." [SNORING] "THEY LET HIM OFF EARLY, AND THIS IS WHERE WE FOUND HIM." "¿CUCO?" [SNORING] LISTEN, I'VE CHANGED MY THINKING. I THINK MORE BLACK AND LATINO PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE KIDS TOGETHER. LOOK AT HIM. "NOW YOU'RE TALKING CRAZY SHIT, VATO. RELAX." WE'D MAKE BEAUTIFUL BABIES. THEY GOT FUCKED-UP HAIR. TRY TO GET A COMB, "AAH!" BECAUSE WITH IMMIGRATION THE WAY IT IS, WE NEED TO CREATE SOME LATINOS THAT CAN FUCKING RUN. DO YOU HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING? BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, WE'RE PINCHE GORDOS. WE CAN'T RUN-- "IMMIGRATION! AY!" IF WE HAD SOME BLACK, WE'D BE GONE. "IMMIGRATION!" PFT PFT PFT. "SON OF A BITCH." "FUCK, HE LEFT HIS WALLET." PFT PFT PFT. HERE'S THE BEAUTIFUL PART ABOUT IMMIGRATION. THIS COUNTRY IS MADE UP OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES, AND NONE OF THEM ARE GOING ANYWHERE, SO WE'RE--THAT'S WHAT MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT--DIVERSITY. MY GRANDMOTHER WAS GONE, MAN. SHE WAS CRAZY. MY GRANDMOTHER USED TO USE DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES TO REMIND HER OF SHIT THAT SHE NEEDED TO GET. LIKE SHE NEVER MADE A LIST. YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAY, "I NEED SHAMPOO, I NEED TO GET SOME BREAD." SHE'D BE IN THE MARKET AND SEE AN ASIAN, "AY, A FUCKING CHINITO. GET RICE." "I SAW THE CHINITO, AND THEN I REMEMBERED THAT I NEEDED TO "GET RICE AND A PEDICURE, BECAUSE MY TACONES ESTáN BIEN FUCKED UP. THEY'RE CRACKED." SHE SEES SOMEBODY FROM THE MIDDLE EAST, "OH, NO." "GET DEODORANT." "WHAT?" "GET DEODORANT, PINCHE HEDIONDO. "GET DEODORANT... AND TOWELS, PA' ACABAR DE CHINGAR." SHE SEES SOMEBODY BLACK, "EY, GET CHARCOAL "FOR THE BARBECUE. "PINCHE NEGRO... AND LOCK THE DOOR." THE SHIT THAT WORKS ON OTHER PEOPLE DOESN'T WORK ON LATINOS. WHEN WE ABUSE DRUGS AND ALCOHOL, WE'RE JUST DRUG ADDICTS... AND NOT ALLOWED IN THE HOUSE. "I DON'T WANT THE PINCHE MARIJUANO IN MY FUCKING HOUSE." BUT WHEN OTHER FAMILIES HAVE A DRUG ADDICT, ALL THE FAMILY GETS TOGETHER, THEY FLY IN, THEY HAVE AN INTERVENTION. THEY'RE VERY ORGANIZED. NO ONE KNOWS. "WE'RE HAVING AN INTERVENTION FOR RILEY. "HE'S ABUSING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND MARIJUANA. "RILEY IS NOT AWARE THAT WE'RE GONNA ACCOST HIM AND READ THE "TIMES THAT HE'S BEEN DRUNK IN PUBLIC AND USING BARBITURATES AND MARIJUANA." AND HE COMES IN, "HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?" "RILEY, YOU'RE A DRUG ADDICT." 25 MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY. YOU CAN'T GET 25 BLACK AND LATINO PEOPLE TOGETHER UNLESS YOU HAVE DRUGS AND ALCOHOL. "WE AIN'T GONNA FUCKING SHOW UP JUST TO TALK. "WHAT? FUCK, SHIT. FUCK THAT SHIT. "WHAT THE HELL? THAT'S FUCKING BULLSHIT, EY." "I DON'T WANT HIM TO STOP SMOKING WEED. HE'S MY BEST CUSTOMER." HERE'S THE BEAUTIFUL PART-- WHEN YOU DECIDE WHO YOU WANT TO SPEND YOUR LIFE WITH, MAKE SURE IT'S SOMEBODY WHO LOVES YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU ARE AND YOUR GOOD SIDE AND YOUR BAD SIDE. FIND SOMEBODY--GOOD LUCK! GOOD LUCK! BECAUSE IF YOU GOT A DUDE THAT DRINKS AND YOU WANT A DUDE THAT DON'T DRINK, MAKE IT EASY ON YOURSELF, DATE A DUDE THAT DON'T DRINK. SO WHEN YOU GET MARRIED, HE'S GONNA FUCKING DRINK MORE. IT'S NATURAL. SO THAT WAY, YOU'RE NOT AT THE WEDDING, COUNTING HIS DRINKS. YOU'RE LAUGHING. EVERYTHING COOL, AND YOU SEE... "THAT'S 3 DRINKS." [CHEERING] AND THEY RUN UP ON YOU AND YELL AT YOU, BUT THEY THINK THAT THEY'RE WHISPERING. "I DON'T LIKE YOU WHEN YOU'RE DRUNK." "FUCK, YOU SCARED ME. TAKE IT EASY." "I DON'T LIKE YOU WHEN YOU'RE DRUNK." AND EVERYBODY AT THE WEDDING, "OH, SHIT." "¿QUé PASó?" "AH, PINCHE LA CABRONA WENT AT HIM, AND SHE SAID, "I DON'T LIKE YOU WHEN YOU'RE DRUNK." "AND WHAT DID HE SAY?" "HE HASN'T SAID NOTHING. WE'RE WAITING RIGHT NOW." "I DON'T LIKE YOU WHEN YOU--YOU'RE DRUNK." "WELL...¿SABES QUé? I DON'T LIKE YOU WHEN I'M SOBER." "FUCK, SHUT THE FUCK-- I'M ALL FUCKED UP." [IMITATES VOMITING] WHEN YOU'RE DATING AND GIRLS START TO SPEND THE NIGHT, NONE OF THEM SNORE. LINGERIE, HALF A NIPPLE POPPING OUT... AY! "NOT YET. NOT YET." "NOT YET." "PUT YOUR CHORIZO AWAY. NOT YET." AND WHEN THEY--WHEN THEY SLEEP--BEAUTIFUL, LA CABRONA. BEAUTIFUL FACE... WITH LIKE A LOVE IN THE AIR Y LA CHI-- AND THEY CATCH THEMSELVES-- [SNORING] "DO YOU SNORE?" "OH, MY, GOD! "I DON'T. I SWEAR TO GOD, I DON'T. "DON'T PUT IT ON TWITTER. DON'T PUT IT ON FACEBOOK. "I DON'T... AND DON'T BREAK UP WITH ME. I SWEAR, I DON'T SNORE." THE MINUTE YOU GET MARRIED, THE MINUTE YOU SAY, "I DO," THEY DO. PINCHE WEDDING NIGHT-- [SNORING] YOU MOVE THEM, AND THEY MOVE TO THE SNORE... [SNORING] LIKE A RAPPER. [SNORING] FUCKING BELL. [SNORING] FUCKING QUEEFS. [SNORING] [KNOCKING] "ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?" "YEAH, THEY'RE JUST SOME QUEEFS. GO BACK TO SLEEP." THAT'S HOW YOU START GETTING THE CUTE NICKNAMES, "óRALE MISSES SUTHERLAND." "WHAT?" "QUEEFER?" "QUEEFER SUTHERLAND?" "24?" "LAST NIGHT YOU DID 16, BUT TONIGHT YOU'LL PROLLY DO 24." AND WHEN THEY SNORE, THEY SNORE. I DON'T GIVE A FUCK. PHONE RINGING, TV ON, TWO-YEAR-OLD OPENING THEIR EYE. [SNORING] THEY'LL GO TO THE DOCTOR AND GET ONE OF THOSE JET FIGHTER MASKS. "THAT'S SO HOT." THEY COME TO BED. PFT... "UH, ROGER, ONE-9er, UH, ROGER--" [SNORING] "UH, GOOD NIGHT, UH, ROGER, ONE-9er, UH, ROGER?" "DO YOU WANT SOME HEAD?" "NO, THANKS, TOP GUN. I'M COOL. I'LL JACK OFF IN THE OTHER ROOM." AND THEN, IF YOU'RE A DUDE, AND THEY GOT A DOG, THE FUCKING DOG SNORES, TOO. PINCHE VIEJA AND THE DOG ARE HOLDING PAWS AND HANDS. [SNORING] [WHINE WHINE] YOU EVER SEE A DOG HAVE NIGHTMARES IN THEIR SLEEP? [GROWLS] FUCKING SHIT. [HOWLS] SO, YOU GOT THIS--PFT... [WHINE] PFT... [WHINE] AND THE MINUTE YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM, THE DOG ROLLS IN YOUR SPOT. "EY, FUCKING DOG, BEAT IT." "WELL, YOU TELL HIM I'M NOT GONNA MOVE." "THAT'S THE DOG AND SHE'S NOT GONNA MOVE, SO GET OUT OF HERE." IF A DOG IS IN YOUR BED, YOU HAVE LOST CONTROL OF YOUR BED. A BED IS A MAN'S BED. THE BEDROOM IS THE MAN'S BEDROOM. THERE'S NO ROOM FOR A PINCHE PERRO ON THE BED. BUT INSTEAD, WE DON'T SAY NOTHING. EVEN WHEN YOU'RE DATING AND THEY PEE, IT'S CUTE. WHEN THEY PEE, IT SOUNDS LIKE A LITTLE ICE CREAM TRUCK, YOU KNOW? YOU CAN HEAR IT--"I'M GONNA GO POTTY." ♪ TEEDLE DITTLE LEE TEEDLE DITTLE LOO ♪ ♪ TEET TUREET TUTEET TEET TEET ♪ ♪ TEEDLE DITTLE LEE TEEDLE DITTLE LOO ♪ ♪ TEET TUREET TEET TEET ♪ ♪ TEET TEET TEEDLE DOO TEET TEET ♪ ♪ TEET TEET TEEDLE DOO TEET TEET ♪ ♪ TEEDLE DITTLE LEE ♪ ♪ TEEDLE DITTLE LEE TUT TUREET ♪ "HEY!" "ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?" "I DROPPED MY LIP GLOSS." LISTEN, LIFE IS TOO SHORT. FIND YOUR HAPPY PLACE, AND BE HAPPY BECAUSE LIFE IS TOO SHORT, NO MATTER HOW LONG YOU LIVE! [CHEERING] IT'S TOO SHORT. YOU SEE PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT EVERY FUCKING THING THEY PUT IN THEIR BODY. LATINOS, WE JUST EAT. WE LOVE TO EAT. WE HAVE FUN. WE ENJOY LIFE. [CHEERING] YOU SEE PEOPLE GO TO THE RESTAURANT, "UM, HI. UM, "I'M A VEGAN... AND I DON'T CONSUME MEAT, AND I DON'T CONSUME DAIRY." "WELL, THEN, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING HERE?" "I DON'T CONSUME--" "I HEARD YOU." "AND I DON'T CONSUME DAIRY." "HEH. NO, BUT YOU'LL SUCK A DICK, HUH, CABRONA?" "THERE'S MILK IN THERE. KEEP PULLING IT." LISTEN, LIVE YOUR LIFE. GET FAT. WHEN YOU DIE, YOU SHOULD BE THE FATTEST YOU'VE EVER BEEN IN YOUR LIFE. LET YOUR PALLBEARERS WORRY ABOUT IT. FUCK THAT. LET THEM WORRY ABOUT IT. "AY, QUE LA CHINGADA. FUCK. "PINCHE GORDO, HOW FAR DO WE HAVE TO GO? "AY, MY LEG IS BURNING. "I GOT TO PUT HIM DOWN. MY LEG IS BURNING. "I'M GONNA PUT HIM DOWN. TELL THE PRIEST--EY, PRIEST, COME HALFWAY, VATO, WE CAN'T." [FART NOISE] "AY, ME SALIO CACA, AY." IF YOU LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO WHERE YOUR PITO DON'T WORK... YOU AND YOUR WIFE SHOULD SHAKE HANDS, "HEY, BABY, IT WAS "A GOOD RUN. "45 YEARS-- [BANG] "AND NOW, NOTHING. "LET'S GET THE SAME FUCKING HAIRCUT AND TRAVEL. "FUCK IT. GET THE LESBIAN HAIRCUT AND LET'S SEE THE WORLD!" THE SCARIEST SHIT--I TOOK A PICTURE OF MY VERGA WHEN I TURNED 50. IT LOOKED LIKE THE LAST KID IN THE CARPOOL, THE ONE THAT DIDN'T GET PICKED UP. IF YOU SEND A PICTURE OF YOUR PENIS, IT BETTER LOOK LIKE A PENIS. YOU DON'T WANT A GIRL TO SEE IT, "WHAT THE FUCK? ¿QUé ES ESO?" "I DON'T KNOW. LET ME SEE IT THERE. "AY, ES UN PAJARITO THAT GOT CHEWED UP, MIRA. "ES A BIRD THAT GOT ATTACKED. "TA FEO, MIRA, THE TWO EGGS ARE--UH-- "AND HE'S CRYING OUT OF ONE EYE. "DON'T--DON'T GET HIM, BECAUSE HE'S GONNA DIE. DEJALO EN PAZ. LET HIM DIE." THIS IS AN ELECTION YEAR. WE ALL KNOW IT'S ELECTION YEAR. LATINOS HAVE THE MOST POWERFUL VOTE IN THIS COUNTRY. THE LATINO VOTE IS VERY POWERFUL. WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT OUR VOTE CAN CHANGE THE COURSE OF THIS POLITICAL CAMPAIGN. WE CAN ELECT THE PRESIDENT. WE! I'LL RUN FOR PRESIDENT, FUCK IT. I GOT THE LATINO VOTE. I'LL RUN-- [CHEERING] "WHO'S GONNA BE YOUR VICE PRESIDENT?" CARLOS SANTANA. óRALE. "HELLO. HI. HELLO. "HEY. HELLO. HELLO. PEACE. "HELLO. LIGHT. LOVE AND LIGHT. HELLO." ES PUTO. MITT ROMNEY WANTS THE LATINO VOTE. HE AIN'T GONNA GET IT. HE AIN'T GONNA GET IT! AND YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE MITT ROMNEY IS A FUCKING LATINO AND HE WON'T ADMIT IT. HIS FATHER WAS BORN IN CHIHUAHUA, MEXICO. MITT ROMNEY IS A CHICANO! BUT HE WON'T ADMIT IT. "I AM NOT. I AM DANISH. I'M FRENCH." IF YOU WANT OUR VOTE, PUTO, COME OUT OF THE CLOSET. GET A HAIRNET AND LEAN BACK AND SAY, "óRALE." "ME LLAMO MITT, PERO ME PUEDE LLAMAR GUANTE." HIS FATHER--HIS GRANDFATHER WENT TO MEXICO TO CREATE A MORMON COLONY. THAT DON'T SIT GOOD WITH MEXICANS. WHERE YOU WANT 6 WIVES TO GET 12 KIDS, FUCKING LATINOS CAN HAVE ONE WIFE... AND GET 12 KIDS. DON'T FUCKING CHEAT. OBAMA'S THE CLOSEST THING TO LATINO THAT WE HAVE. BARACK--EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE, TOO. AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT, SHERIFF JOE, IN ARIZONA-- FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING PUTO. HOW ABOUT THAT? [CHEERING] FUCK YOU. YOU FAT MOTHERFUCKER. FUCK YOU. I SAID I WAS GONNA TALK SOME SHIT. FUCK YOU, SHERIFF JOE, YOU FUCKING PUTO. FUCK YOU. [CHEERING] I'VE BEEN TO THE WHITE HOUSE 3 TIMES. EL NEGRO, I MEAN, BARACK OBAMA HAS INVITED ME. IN 2008, HE CALLED MY HOUSE. MY GRANDMOTHER ANSWERED THE PHONE, "HELLO?" "THIS IS BARACK OBAMA." "HANG ON, NEGRO. "EY. I TOLD YOU I DON'T WANT HIM IN MY HOUSE!" "HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT." "TA' EL LOCO EL NEGRO DE PRESIDENT--¿QUé CHINGADOS? AND I'M GONNA BE MISS UTERUS--THAT BEAUTY PAGEANT." SO I WENT TO THE STATE DINNER FOR THE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO. BARACK OBAMA INVITED ME. I'VE BEEN TO THE WHITE HOUSE 3 TIMES. A LITTLE KID BORN IN THE GENERAL HOSPITAL IN LOS ANGELES... [CHEERING] GREW UP IN SAN FERNANDO... AND THE WHITE HOUSE! HONRA! AND EVERY TIME I'VE BEEN TO THE WHITE HOUSE, I STEAL SOME SHIT. [CHEERING] AND WHEN I WALK OUT, I LOOK LIKE I STOLE SHIT. I WENT TO THE CEREMONY, AHí. THEY HAD MOLE. I SAID, "BARACK OBAMA, CHINGAO! PINCHE NEGRO--MOLE." BUT NOBODY PRONOUNCED IT MOLE. "DID YOU ENJOY THE MOLEE? THE MOLEE? DID YOU ENJOY IT?" "NO, I HAD MOLE." AND HERE'S THE BEAUTIFUL PART-- I GOT A STAR ON THE WALK OF FAME. I GOT A WAX FIGURE-- [CHEERING] THE GREATEST THING-- THE GREATEST THING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED IS AT THE WHITE HOUSE THEY MADE ME CORN AND FLOUR TORTILLAS IN THE KITCHEN. [CHEERING] BECAUSE IF THE PRESIDENT IS BLACK, GUESS WHO'S IN THE KITCHEN. [MARIACHI MUSIC PLAYING] SO THE PRESIDENT COMES AROUND, "THANK YOU FOR COMING "TO THE WHITE HOUSE. "THANK YOU FOR COMING TO THE WHITE HOUSE. DID YOU ENJOY THE MOLEE? IT WAS FANTASTIC, WAS IT NOT?" "IT WAS FANTASTIC. THANK YOU. "THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU." "GEORGE, DID YOU NOT ENJOY THE MOLEE?" "COME ON, VATO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE THAT VOICE NO MORE." "I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING." "CHINGADA, VATO. USE YOUR REAL VOICE." "YOU WON." HE LOOKS AROUND. "MOTHERFUCKER, EAT YOUR SHIT." [CHEERING] "EAT YOUR SHIT! MOTHERFUCKER, EAT YOUR MOLE SHIT!" HERE COMES MICHELLE OBAMA. "WELCOME TO THE WHITE HOUSE. I'M THE FIRST LADY. WELCOME TO THE WHITE HOUSE." "MOTHERFUCKER, EAT YOUR SHIT. I TOLD THE MOTHERFUCKER-- EAT YOUR SHIT." AND I FORGOT I HAD ANOTHER VOICE. "HANG ON, NEGROS, I'M WAITING FOR TORTILLAS." "COOL." SO THEY HAD THESE LITTLE PLACEMATS. THESE LITTLE 24-KARAT GOLD--ON ONE SIDE IT HAD THE AMERICAN FLAG, AND THE OTHER SIDE IT HAD THE MEXICAN FLAG. YOU EVER SEE SOME SHIT-- THE SECOND YOU SEE IT, YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA STEAL THAT SHIT. [LAUGHTER] AND WHEN THEY CAME TO COLLECT THEM, THE WAITER WAS LATINO. I WAS LIKE, "AHH, FUCK." "DAME LA CHINGADERA, CABRóN." "I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, VATO." "PINCHE MEXICANO, DAME LA CHINGADERA, CABRóN." AND THEN HE FINALLY GAVE IN. "I'LL SELL YOU TWO MORE FOR $100. "DAME LOS DOS. "3 FOR 100. CHINGA SU MADRE. DON'T TELL THE NEGRO. IT'S ALL RIGHT." SO I TOOK IT... AND SONIA SOTOMAYOR WAS SITTING AT THE TABLE, SO I FELT A LITTLE GUILTY. I WAS LIKE, "CHINGADA--" BUT THE BEAUTIFUL PART ABOUT SONIA SOTOMAYOR WAS WHEN SHE GOT SWORN IN--LEAVING THE CEREMONY, SHE FELL... AND BROKE HER ANKLE. THAT'S KEEPING IT REAL. SHE WASN'T EVEN ON THE JOB YET AND WAS ALREADY ON WORKMEN'S COMP. SO--EY, ALL LATINOS ARE JUDGES ANYWAYS. YOU MIGHT AS WELL MAKE ONE FUCKING OFFICIAL. THEY'RE ALL JUDGES--"I DON'T LIKE YOUR FRIENDS." "I DON'T LIKE YOUR FRIENDS." "OH, I DON'T LIKE YOUR FRIENDS." SO I WALK OUT, AND I TAKE IT BACK TO THE HOTEL, AND I'M LOOKING AT IT IN THE LIGHT-- KISSING IT Y LA VERGA. [KISSES] I PUT IT ON THE--NA, ON THE TABLE RIGHT THERE, WITH THE MEXICAN FLAG TOWARDS ME... AND EVERYBODY THAT I'M WITH SEES IT, AND THEY FREAK OUT, "OH, MY, GOD! "WHAT IS THAT? "OH, MY GOD. WHAT IS THAT?" "THAT'S THE FUCKING THING FROM THE TABLE." "YOU TOOK IT? YOU TOOK IT? YOU TOOK IT?" "FUCK IT. YEAH. FUCK YEAH, I TOOK IT." "AND I TELL YOU WHEN THEY TAKE YOURS, I WOULD'VE TAKEN IT, TOO." AND THEY ALL FREAK OUT, "OH, MY, GOD. "I HAVE KIDS. I HAVE PILATES. "I'M A DEN MOTHER. I CAN'T BE AN ACCESSORY. "I CANNOT. "I HAVE--I HAVE MOMMY AND ME CLASS ON MONDAY. I CAN'T GO TO JAIL." THIS IS WHAT THEY TRY TO TELL ME. GUILT DOES NOT WORK ON LATINOS. WE LIVE WITH GUILT. THIS IS WHAT THEY SAY TO ME--ALL 3 OF THEM, LIKE AN INTERVENTION, "WHAT KIND... "OF AN AMERICAN STEALS... FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES?" I SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT KIND, MOTHERFUCKERS? A MEXICAN AMERICAN." [CHEERING] THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LOS ANGELES. I LOVE YOU! [CHEERING] GRACIAS, HBO! VIVA MéXICO! VIVA LA RAZA! SHOW! GOOD NIGHT! HONRA!
