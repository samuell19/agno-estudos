Ladies and gentlemen. The Producers of this picture thought it would be only fair To give you ample warning of what you are about to witness This motion picture contains elements of horror, Terror, and.... Demonic possession. So, if you are of a weak disposition or easily offended, please leave this screening at once. The management will be more than happy to refund your tickets. Have they gone? Good. Those of you who are brave enough to stay You have been warned. So, without any further ado It is my pleasure, Or should I say displeasure? To present our feature presentation... Have we passed Westwood Station? Oh, no, no, two more stops. No need to fret, pilgrim, just a force of habit is all. Care for a gut warmer? Woah! Strong stuff! Takes some getting used to I guess. George Walker Oh! George Walker? Not THE George Walker, the American oil tycoon? I would have had you as being much older. You're thinking of my Pa. Ah... so you are A Junior. I don't think I got your name. Jeffrey Bank. Pleasure, I'm sure. So, what's a Yank oil man doing in this part of the world? I'm visiting an old friend from my Oxford days He just acquired a 'Westwood Manor' What? You didn't have me pegged for an Oxford scholar? No no no... it's just Westwood Manor Now that is interesting. Interesting how? Oh no its just... local gossip I wouldn't want to waste your time with all that nonsense Well, until this train pulls into Westwood Station I got all the time in the world Spin me your nonsense. Well then... I mean Westwood Manor has stood empty for most of it's life People have come and gone But they've never stayed more than a year or two. Then a few winters back a strange individual took up residency He never went into the village He was something of a hermit And then, ah, well, The noises started And every night the noises got louder, and more terrifying The villagers wouldn't even leave their homes after nightfall And then, just as suddenly The noises stopped And the house stood silent and empty once more. And the hermit? What became of him? Well no one knows But the villagers were so terrified... Even the bravest will not enter that house to this day You can't try frightening me, You English folk are as slow as a Sunday afternoon My station's just coming up It's been very nice passing a bit of time with you. And, ah... Tread carefully, Mr Walker You're not in Texas any longer. Must you drive so fast? Cars are built for speed. No point driving if you're gonna go slow. But you know that it makes me nervous. We're all going to die, Elizabeth The one thing we can choose is if we do it with style. And crashing into a ditch is with style? Very well Thank you. What's the matter? You've barely spoken since we left London Nothing, I'm fine You're a terrible liar, you know that? I wish we weren't coming this weekend. Why? What are you afraid of? What if nobody likes me? How could anyone dislike you? You're simply charming. Well I'm not exactly... Not exactly what? I'm just a solicitor's secretary I'm not in the oil business, or... A famous tennis player A famous tennis player who hasn't won a match in the last two tournaments At that rate my dear You're far more successful than me. Christine. Hello George. I didn't see you board the train at Paddington Been some time. Hasn't it? How have you been keeping? Just fine, thank you. Well you look as pretty as a pie supper How are you? Better now. Shall we head inside? Inquire about a car? After you. Let me take your bags. I'm sure I'll manage. It's magnificent And it's all Victor's? Yes, his father was a very rich man They despised each other. Why? He disagreed with Victor's lifestyle Too much time in restaurants and clubs And not in libraries and university But then he died And left Victor a small fortune. Can't say he's been spending it wisely What do you mean? Victor is a creature of appetite But he also has a very short attention span. Fads come and go. A few months ago it was all about Polo Then it was hot-air ballooning... And now it's this house. God knows what will be next. It's rather sinister isn't it? Yes... I suppose it is. Come. Let's go find our host. Hello?? Freddie, old boy!! Well, what do you think?! I love what you've done with the place You know you really should put me in touch with a decorator My apartment has far too many upright walls. Ha ha! Oh very funny How are we? Oh much better now that you're here And this must be... Elizabeth Elizabeth Barton How do you do? Very good to see you! This house is... Terrible. What on earth possessed you to buy it? All in good time, but first Let me show you to your quarters. Then we can crack on with some serious drinking Don't mind if I do! The Master Bedroom! How cosy. It's a little run down But the bed seems to be in perfectly good order. Thank you. Well, we'll leave you in peace! Freddie, I'll show you your room Drinks in about... half an hour. Just this way, Freddie George! You big American bastard! Wonderful to see you again! You too. What the hell happened here? It's a work in progress old boy. And my dear sister... how are we? Vicky. Um, is something wrong with my hand? Oh my god you're right! Drinks in ten minutes everyone. Let me show you to your quarters Mind the, uh, debris... Not ready yet? Oh! You startled me I'm sorry... need help with my cufflinks. Rather silly, a grown man who still can't do his own. Luckily you have me to help. Yes... about that. I was wondering if you'd always like to help me with my cufflinks. What do you mean? I'm asking you to marry me you little fool. Really? Yes. Not the most romantic way to ask, I know But there you go. Well? I don't know what to say... Well... yes of course Yes! Good girl. Now that's settled you should really get changed. Victor hates to be kept waiting. Here we are. Thank you And Bourbon, no junk for our... Transatlantic friend Now you're talking! Where's Freddie? Is he late? I believe he's changing I heard he's got a new pet Now now Christine we must not - Ah, speak of the devil! Look what the cat dragged in! Hello old boy, it's been a while. Ain't it just Christine... a pleasure I'm afraid I'm simply too weary from my journey to stand. Of course, how rude of me This is Elizabeth Barton Elizabeth, this is George Walker, Junior Pleasure to meet you little lady And allow me to introduce my darling sister, Christine. How do you do? I'll be right as rain as soon as I finish this And Elizabeth...? Oh, no thank you I don't drink. How very proper. Well isn't this nice! All of us, back together again Like the good old days! Here's to a weekend in the country Cheers! Is this safe to eat? Haven't had the chance to hire any staff I'm afraid. This is the product of my afternoon in the kitchen Oh god, well in that case this is a miracle. Well Victor You may have let us down in the kitchen But you certainly made up for it in the cellar This 1895 Chateaux Palmer is a wonderful wine Well drink up everyone there's plenty more where that came from. Oh, I am sorry there wasn't anything apart from water for you. Water's fine, thank you. I must say, Elizabeth It's a pleasure to finally meet you. Freddie's normally so shy about introducing us to his friends. Well I've been so busy with practice lately I've hardly been off the court. You know I think there's a tennis court somewhere on the grounds Maybe we could have a game tomorrow By the sounds of it you need all the practice you can get! To hell with you. So how did you two meet? Arthur Brown's Christmas party drinks. You've been keeping her hidden since Christmas?! Poor show. Well, didn't want to give you any ideas Did I, old boy? And what do you do? Christine. What? Can't I ask her anything? A secretary. A mute one, no doubt? For a solicitor. And what does being a solicitor's secretary involve? Mostly arranging meetings, and typing letters. That sort of thing. But my real passion is writing Well what sort of writing? Are we in the presence of the next Jane Austen? No I don't think so More Shelley than Austen Oh please... Well come on, tell us more! It's not very interesting Oh no it sounds simply fascinating We all wanna know! Well... it's a ghost story of sorts And what happens in this ghost story of sorts? It's about a girl. A little girl who is raised in an orphanage And she's haunted by ghosts Only as she grows up, and the story continues She realises that ghosts aren't the ones to fear. Well what are the ones to fear? The humans. Oh! I am so sorry Elizabeth! Oh no it's fine!! No don't worry... No don't... don't! Don't worry Victor It was only a cheap dress. Is everything alright Elizabeth? I'm... I'm fine It was an honest accident Just let me clean myself up. ...eventually we reached the summit Even though we walked downhill - Elizabeth, I am so sorry for before Not to worry So... Christine I don't think I heard What is it that you do exactly? Do?? Well darling, I do this! And you do it better than anyone else could! Oh you're too kind How very... rewarding I'm sure. Oooh! Christine you better watch out This one's got claws! Shut up Victor. If I may be so bold I'd like to make a toast. Oh, everyone, charge your glasses! Proceed. Well I wasn't planning on saying anything just yet But, why not? Seeing as we're all here And maybe this wine has got the better of my senses But we're engaged We are to be married I say! Congratulations Congratulations Thank you Congratulations. Christine. Hello again. Did you receive my letters? Yes... Well I didn't get a reply No. I thought it would be kindest that way. Kindest? What would you know about kindness? Well the last time we saw each other You were telling me you never wanted to see me again Can't a man change his mind? I must say... When I read your first letter I was very surprised when I got to the end and saw it was from you. Why? Who else would it be from? Does it matter? They were all signed George Walker Junior. Don't call me Junior. I must say, George That's a very big knife. I do hope you're not trying to compensate for something. How about a game of bridge? No no... I have specially arranged entertainment for us this evening. What time is it? Nine twenty-five Good. She should be here soon then. Who should be here soon? All will be explained shortly. Yes... but let us retire to the games room! Well, sit, sit Make yourselves comfortable. Oh, would anyone like a drink? Whiskey, neat. I'll have one too, with ice. I think we have some sherry... Sherry? Sherry. Sherry... Sherry? Sherry? No I... Elizabeth doesn't drink, remember? Of course, how silly of me I'll just fetch you some water. Whiskey, no junk. So old boy. Save the theatrics... What's this all about? Well... If you're so determined to ruin my fun This is no ordinary house. This house was owned by Ichabod Quinn! Who? I'm not sure how much you know about the world of the paranormal But over the past few months I've become quite fascinated by it What, ghosts and monsters? That sort of nonsense? Exactly. But I wouldn't call it nonsense. What's all this got to do with this Ichabod character? Mr Quinn was one of the greatest occultists who ever lived. He pushed the boundaries of magic to its utmost limit Going further than anyone else before He was also a painter He would take various substances in order to connect with the other side Once in a trance-like state, he would begin to paint what he saw. But when he fell gravely ill, he wrote to his mentor that he was close to acheiving his life's work "After years of searching... my quest has come to an end... I have found the birthplace... of desire and destruction Tonight, under the eye of the moon I will pull back the veil of this world And go to the utter blackness I am close, so very close. Close to what? A gateway to the other side Then one day he vanished Never to be seen again Legend has it that if a séance is conducted one can raise his tormented soul. Are you suggesting we... Yes! That we perform a séance tonight, and we make contact with Mr Quinn. But why would anyone do such a thing? Why? Why not? Beats bridge at any rate. Do you even know how to conduct one? No... not exactly. But from what I read it's not as hard as one may think. All we require is a medium. A what now? Someone who has the power to communicate with the dead. Very shrewd Elizabeth. A medium will soon be joining us, one that has been personally recommended to me. Well, who is this medium? She's supposed to be very good, in fact She put old Percy King in touch with his deceased father in order to get the combination to his safe. I assume it worked? Take a look at his new mansion If I'm not very much mistaken That will be her now. You're looking a little uneasy, George. Another drink? Settle your nerves? Please George Walker Junior, afraid? Now that is a first. I just think its dumb as dirt to go messing with things we don't know diddly-squat about. Well I think it's a ripping idea. Here's to the paranormal. Ladies and Gentlemen... Madame Bellrose! Good evening! Let me introduce you to - Mr Turner, the tennis player Ah, yes... And you must be Mr Walker Junior, the oil man Yeah, but don't call me Junior... Ms Hall And Ms Barton, I presume Wrong way round Ah well, can't get them all right. How do you already know our names? Oh... a name is a name is a name... Curious... What's curious? Is everything alright Madame Bellrose? Oh yes, perfectly fine Just... a feeling. What kind of feeling? Oh, probably nothing These old houses are full of stories and lives Would you like a drink Madame Bellrose? Well, if you offered me a dry martini... I'd have a dry martini! Of course. So, Ms Bellrose, tell us When did you realise you had these... remarkable powers? Well, it was on my sixth birthday, and I was playing hide and seek with some other children in the woods And I'd just found a rather good hiding place in an old oak tree. Little did I know that this particular tree was home to a surprisingly aggressive magpie Well, on his return he was very displeased to see a grubby six year-old hiding in his tree. And this beastly bird started pecking me and attacking me and I misplaced my footing and down I fell, crashing to the ground. The next thing I knew, I was in bed with a bandage round my head sporting two missing teeth, and the ability to speak to the dead! What a fascinating tale! And does anybody else in your family possess these abilities? Second sight is not like curly hair my dear It's not hereditary. Is there any chance... I mean could it be dangerous to meddle with these sorts of powers? I do not consider myself a meddler! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend. Ah don't worry, don't apologise. Oh, I congratulate you on your dry martini! Thank you. Well like anything exciting, there's always a degree of danger. But, no more so than... slipping on ice, or burning yourself with a match. So you've never had a bad experience? I've slipped, but never fallen. There you are George. There's nothing to fear. Forgive me, Victor, but this is an enormous stick-up, ain't it? You know you actually had me going for a second there. Pardon? You can't really be buying this? This... what? This... Hogwash! Do you think you know the world so well, Mr Walker? Just 'cos a chicken's got wings don't mean it can fly. What on earth does that mean? It means, I ain't taking part in this sham any longer It's fine, Mr Walker to be a little afraid. I ain't yella Oh do pipe down George, you're ruining all our fun. Well I'm game. If everyone else is. Great show! Christine? Oh why not... Elizabeth? I can't say I'm not a little nervous about the idea... But what about your novel? You're writing a ghost story. Simply think of this as... research. Yes... and I thought the ghosts weren't the ones to fear Remember? Come on, it's just a bit of fun. Very well. Splendiferous! Well... just you then George. Fine! Why the hell not? I'm in the minority here anyways. Let's get this over and done with. Aha! What a riot! Madame Bellrose, is there anything else you need which I haven't already laid out? No, Mr Hall, you've done very well at following my instructions. Now, if you wouldn't mind taking your places Now, place your hands on the table, like so. Make sure your fingers are touching Very good. Now I ask you do not speak or make any sudden movements, and try to clear your mind of any thoughts. You want us to think of nothing? Should be easy for you, Victor. Yes, clear your mind, it makes for a better connection. Is it likely that we'll make contact? I can't promise anything... but if we do, I ask you do not break the circle. Do you understand? Yes Right, we're ready. Spirits, we bring you gifts from life into death. Commune with us! And move amongst us. Is that rotten bread? Yes, my dear, it enhances the flavour Spirits have very weakened taste buds. Now don't interrupt again. Spirits, we bring you gifts from life into death. Commune with us, and move amongst us. Maybe they've got food poisoning... Do you see us, beloved one? Spirits, can you hear us? Is there anyone here who wishes to make contact with someone from the other side? Yes I wish to make contact with Mr Ichabod Quinn. Spirits of the past, move amongst us Mr Ichabod Quinn, be guided by the light of this world and visit upon us. Is that you, Mr Quinn? Can you see him? I can't see anyone. Look closely, can't you see? I can see clearly... A pale man, in a black suit headed towards us. He's coming this way. Is that you, Mr Quinn? This is all just - Don't break the circle! Come! Come again! Come forward... Oh! But your eyes! What's happened to your eyes!? No!! No no no!! Go back! Go back!! Madame Bellrose? What on earth is going on? Is she alright? This house... will become your tomb. Your flesh will be torn, your bones crushed to dust and your souls extracted to a painful and terrifying eternity What the hell is she talking about? When the dawn breaks The twelve kings and twelve dukes of Hell will be released upon this earth. Flames will engulf you and the great beast will rip you limb from limb for all of time. They will sit upon the throne of blood... in an Eden of pain! Careful! HERE COMES HELL!! My god!! Well I think another drink is in order? She's still kicking. What happened to her? She must be having some kind of seizure... or attack of the brain. She seemed to get stronger!? Is that even possible? Strong as a bull! So what do we do with her now? We should call for a doctor. This house has no line. We should drive to the village then. I think she's trying to say say something. My god!!! Freddie!! Quick! Put pressure on the wound! George you just shot my guest! Whiskey! Deep breath, deep breath calm down. Drink that. You're going to be fine My serving arm!! Do you always bring a gun to a dinner party!!?? I think it might be time we made ourselves scarce. It won't budge! Stand back!! Is there another way out? Yes, the rear door. This way! It can't be! I told you not to mess with this paranormal shit! She can't see us... move back, quietly Sorry! Don't mess with Texas. How much ammunition did you bring?! Flee!!!! Freddie!! Drink! I need a drink. Just something to... take the edge off. Christ!! Who's there? Please! Come on.... Father? Father, is that really you? You have disappointed me, my son. All my fortune I have worked so hard for my entire life You are throwing my life's work to the wind. On boat trips, and pony girls, and holidays to India! And vintage champagne. What has become of your potential? Father I'm sorry! I'm sorry... Ha ha ha! You cannot escape!! You will burn!!! Father, no!!! What kind of bloody house is this!? Let me see your hand! It's nothing, stop fussing! Let me! We need to cut it off. Don't be stupid. It's just a little infected. Dear God!! Freddie!! What... what's happening to me? What's happening to me? No, I'm shrinking! Victor I'm shrinking! Victor, help me! I'm shrinking! Freddie!! George?? I'm shrinking!! Why am I shrinking? Help! Help me! Why aren't you helping!? Victor!! Why can't you hear me!? Victor!? Freddie?? Come on George, I know you can hear me! Can't you hear me, George!? Please, please help! I'm down here!! Can't you hear me!!?? Please!! George I know you can hear me! Any of you... Please! Elizabeth!! Please! Please will you help me?! Christine?? What are you doing down there? Elizabeth please will you help?? Elizabeth? Elizabeth... no!! Look everyone, I found Christine! Gosh, she's so small! I didn't even notice she'd gone. What's she saying? I'm still here! So insignificant! Get rid of her! Yes... squash her!! Don't squash me, please, I'm not insignificant! Squash her!! George? Christine? Thank god, you're safe. I've started to see things. I'm so afraid... will you protect me? Of course I will, you know I always will. Oh George, you're so kind. I was such a fool to ever give you the ring back. God I can be so cruel... Every day this past year I've regretted that decision. I've always loved you. I... Fuck me!! Kiss me George!!! Don't you love me, George!?? So much for compensating for something. This way. Christine! Victor! You scared the life out of me! God you gave me a fright! Shut up! In here! Quick, into the games room! It seems to be all- George! Stay back! What the bloody hell do you think you're doing?! Stop talking and do as I say Or I will gun you down like a dog in the street. Sit. What's gotten into you? Ain't a question of what's gotten into me. It's a question of what may have gotten into you. These spirits, or whatever you want to call them Can take on the form of us. We're not evil spirits, George, we're human. Now whatever the hell this is, it's trying to play games with us. It wants to beat us. You have to believe me. Maybe you're telling the truth. Maybe you aint. Until I am one hundred percent sure that you are who you say you are... I'm gonna keep my gun trained on you. Is that crystal clear? Now, where's Freddie? Dead. What? He's dead. How? I killed him. Why? Why!? Hold up there. Now I've got the gun. So let's just calm down - George! Look at me! Look at me... Everything's going to be alright! Oh god!! Everything's going to be fine... everything's going to be just fine George!! It's gonna be fine... just fine... George? George? George? Oh George, you poor fool... What have you done, Vicky? I'm sorry... it was just a mistake It just went off... Oh god... why is this happening? We haven't done anything we just- Performed a séance. We wanted to make contact with Ichabod Quinn and we did. And now he's back and he wants to finish his life's work. We've opened Hell. George was right. We shouldn't have meddled with this. This is all your fault! You made us do that bloody séance... Don't blame me! All of this was just meant to be a bit of fun! You've damned us all you fucking idiot!! Try and calm down you're being hysterical! That's enough! There's no use in pointing fingers now. We're all in the same boat. If we want to get out of here alive we're going to have to start working together. What can we do? Remember what Madame Bellrose said? At dawn, the moon will consume the sun. We need to end this now, or God knows what will happen. But how? We need to find the gateway to Hell and close it for good. The basement. That's where Ichabod would conduct his ceremonies to contact the other side, at the lowest point of the house. That's where we saw that thing, Madame Bellrose, heading. The party's over. Whiskey? She doesn't drink, remember? Chin chin. Coast is clear. It's faster if we cut through here. Where do we go now? Through this door, then turn right. Much too slow, Christine! Damn! Let me see! No, don't bother. I'm done for! No, no you're not! I don't want to turn into one of them! Don't let me! No, no you can't! Please! It's the only way! Don't worry about me, darling sister. Sorry again for spilling wine on your dress... Let's get this over with. No, I'll do it. Some party, hey? A real one to remember. Come on. We have to go now. There's the staircase to the basement. I can't! I can't take it any more. First George, and now... and now poor Victor. Look at me! You need to stay strong, I need your help I can't do this on my own! I can't... I can't take it. Yes you can! And you have to! It's the only way! When we end this, maybe they'll all come back, all of them. Will they? I won't stop until I see the real Freddie again. Don't you want to see your brother again? And George... But how do you know? I don't. But there's only one way to find out. Let's end this, once and for all. You and me. Victor... kills! What is it? It's George! Wait! It might not really be him. I have to be sure. Christine! Christine! Come back! Christine! George? Is it really you? Please? Bye Vicky. Thank you. Don't mention it. We must be getting closer. And the dragon sat on the rock and the rock was the moon and the moon consumed the sun and out of the night came the blackness and from the blackness came the dawn... Now what? Let's kill the bitch. ...comes fear, and fear spawns power... Clever little girls to get so far, but I'm afraid it will be of no use. The gate is opened! And it will remain open until all Hell is set free. Shoot it Elizabeth! Christine! My darling. I'm so glad you came to me my love. I knew you would. I'm ready to be together properly now. No more fooling around. No more toying with other lovers. Now we can be together for an eternity. We'll never be apart again. You're the love of my life, Christine. Don't listen to him, Elizabeth! Is it true? Oh, Elizabeth. Did you really think I marry someone as small as you? How pathetic of you to even say yes when I asked. We were only together for a few mere months. Were you really that desperate? I was only with you to make Christine mad with jealousy. And it worked. Is it true? Elizabeth you have to listen to me - Just answer the question. Yes. So is that why you were so awful to me? I was a fool to behave the way I did you have to believe me, I was just in love with the wrong man! Yes... poor George. He's down there now, burning for eternity. I'm bored of this now. Christine, my love. Let's be together forever! Elizabeth!! Elizabeth please!! She's far too feeble to do anything. I'm so sorry Elizabeth! Elizabeth, please!! You fucking bitches!!! Help!! No!! Christine!! Elizabeth!! Elizabeth!! Hold on!! No!!
