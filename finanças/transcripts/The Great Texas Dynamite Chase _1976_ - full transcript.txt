I just walked into a bank, and I withdrew it. - How'd you do it, girl? - With this. - Now, what the hell do you know about these thangs? - Well, you see, they had me doing roadwork in prison, you know, blowing up concrete and stuff like that. So, I just figured I'd help myself, and I pocketed a few. - They sure did a good job of reforming you. - They could never change her. - But Pop, I wish you coulda been in that bank when I walked in there with that stuff. Boy, you shoulda seen the look on their faces. I wish you all had been there. - I never wanted you to do a thing like this, but, in a crazy way, I'm proud. Your Ma woulda been proud.

Police describe the attractive blond twosome as armed and dangerous. Shit. When we haven't even broken even yet, and they've nailed us as killers. - That's crazy, man. That's below the belt.

Come on. - I'm coming. (mellow music) Gobbly turkey, Candy, look, no one's even around. - Ellie-Jo, that's 'cause it's closed. - Closed? Can't be closed. How can you be closed?

All right, one false move from any of you and this sucker's had it. Okay, now that we've got your attention, we'd like your money. Well, come on, Ellie-Jo, let's go.

Well, it's just a few extra dollars I'm looking for, anyway, and I'm one hell of a worker. - What kind of work have you done? - Oh hell, I've been everything. I've been a bull rider, dock worker, ship clerk, train conductor, truck driver, you name it, I've done it. - Sounds like to me you just can't keep a steady job. - No, that's not it. I, uh, I just don't like being tied down, that's all. - Oh. - Yeah, but this is different. I, uh, I see a future in this. - What do you think, Candy? - Well, I don't see as we need a new partner. - Well, what about a driver? You two could pull off the jobs, and I'll just keep my eyes on the road. - Gee, I don't think we need another driver, either. - What about a hostage? Can I make a deposit? - Okay, honey, one fast move, and he gets it. This is a robbery, sweetheart, money. Put the money in the bag. That a girl, that a girl. A little neater. All right, please, let's go, let's go, let's go, come on. Here we go, here we go. (women scream) (laughing) - All right, come on. Come on, honey, this is a robbery. - Hold it! (gun fires) (Slim screams) (mellow music) - Give them the money. Give them the money, open your drawers. Give him everything he wants. Quick, quick! - Thank you. (mellow music) Thank you. That was perfect. When she was robbed, did we fool her. Ah, they don't know what hit 'em. God, we must have a million dollars. (upbeat music) - Oh no. - Howdy. - [Bank Manager] Oh, no, come on, once is enough, ladies. - [Candy] Come on, now, you've been through this before. Come on. - [Bank Manager] Oh, come on, ladies. (gentle music) - Well, what do you think? - Where did you find this place? - Oh, I just scouted around. - And while you were scouting around, did you happen to check out the prices? - Would you stop worrying about the money? - Would you two cut it out? We came here to have a good time. - Oh, don't mind me. - Are you okay? - Oh, honey, I'm fine. It's my husband. - What did he do? - Well, he screwed it all up. After I went and bought the most gorgeous little mansion, he goes and gets fired from his job. - Oh, I'm, I'm real sorry. - Social climbing's for the birds. I married a loser. Oh hi, honey. We were just talking about you. - It's you. It's you! - Oh, shit! (mellow music) - You get them! - Stop them! - You get them right now! - [Bank Manager] Stop them! They're the bank robbers. - Slim, come on. - Move it. - [Candy] Go! (mellow music) - I thought it would be nice to go out-- - Dammit, now I knew we shouldn't go into a place like that. - Can't a person get a bite to eat? - [Candy] All of fucking Texas is after us. I mean, we make one more stupid move like that, and we are all dead. - Look, we just have to be more careful, that's all. - How was I supposed to know that guy was gonna be there? - That's not the point. - Well, I don't know what the point is. We can't go anywheres. I might as well not exist. - Slim, please. - Well, this isn't what I came for. - [Candy] Well, look, nobody's making you stay. - [Ellie-Jo] Can I sit with you? - I used to sit like this for hours when I was a kid. Somebody told me they'd go all the way to Mexico, and I believed them. We can't go on like this. We're gonna get ourselves killed. - [Ellie-Jo] Listen, Candy says we'll just hide out for a week, Slim, then we'll just make one last job. - We got enough money, now. I think it's time for us to quit. I think it's time for both of us to quit. - [Candy] Hey. If we're gonna get to that place, we better get going. - I'm moving out. Ellie-Jo? - I'm staying. - Hey. (gentle music) I just remembered, I hate bus riding. - Every month it gets higher and higher, and it's just getting-- - Afternoon, folks. - Howdy. - My sisters and I would like one of your nice, quiet cabins for about a week. We're just traveling through and decided to take a rest to kind of break up the trip. - Let's see. I got something for you. Real secluded place, but it's by the lake on the other side of the mountain. - That's it, that's perfect. - [Mrs. Smith] $15 a night, firewood's extra. - There you are. - Road will take you up. - Thank you kindly. Good day to you. - Day. - That boy looks familiar. - Name's Stanley Perkins. - No, it's not the name. It's that face. (mellow music) (laughing and screaming) - [Ellie-Jo] No, no, no. - [Slim] You know. (dramatic music) (yelling and laughing) - No, no, no, Slim. No, no. (Slim screams) No, no, no, ah, Slim, please. Be nice. Be nice. - You're no fun. Let's go in the water. Come on. Let's go in the water. - No, no, no. - 80 yards. - No, no, no, no, no. - Then you'll have to go in the water. - No Slim. No, please! Please. (laughing) (dramatic music) (Ellie-Jo laughing) - Be so much more fun with you. - I love you. I love you, Slim. Slim! - Freeze! - (screaming) Oh god! (crying) Oh God! Slim! Slim! Slim! Slim! - No, come on! Oh, come on! - [Mrs. Smith] The hill, they're up the hill. - Come on! (sirens blaring) Ellie-Jo? Hey. Come on, Ellie-Jo. - Candy, I'm trying to sleep, hon. - I know, but you been sleeping now for three days. - Another month, and I'll be just fine. - See, we can't afford this place one more day. Look, we gotta rob just one more bank. - Keep thinking, Candy, you'll come up with something. - We got no choice. We're broke, Ellie-Jo. - What about the Rolls? - We can't sell our Rolls. Just one more bank, huh? The big haul. Remember? Then we'll make our escape, just you and me, just like I said, to Rio. Sun kissed. Look here, it says exact, and it's right. (mellow music) - [Teller] Can I help you, ma'am? That's Spanish, okay. If you just need me-- (speaking foreign language) Okay, wait a minute. We have a woman here who speaks Spanish. - Uh, excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. Good afternoon. We are the Dynamite Women, and we're here to rob you. So, if you just hand over your money, nobody's gonna get hurt. So, let's go. Come on. - This is too easy. - You're right. (sirens blaring) - [Officer] Hold your fire. - Hands up, ladies, high above your heads. Let's go. - [Ellie-Jo] Take the gun, the gun! (gun fires) - [Officer] Oh, shit, come on. (upbeat music) - [Ellie-Jo] Come on, honey, come on, get out of the car. - You were crazy. - Come on, now. (upbeat music) [Officer] Back to the cars. (upbeat music) - I was trying to park. You should pay attention to the map when I was trying-- - Are the keys in it? - [Woman] Oh my god. - [Man] You want me to call the doctor? But wait. Goddammit, you come back here. (sirens blaring) (upbeat music) - [Candy] Make a right turn. Route 12, make a right. - [Ellie-Jo] Are you sure it's to the border? - [Candy] Of course I'm sure, dammit. (upbeat music) (horse neighs) - It's okay. No, leave it, leave it, leave it. Bandages, please, get me some bandages. (speaking foreign language) Hold on, hold on. (Candy grunting) (speaking foreign language) - Oh shit. This is Mexico, this is Mexico, isn't it? - No, no, senorita, no. No Mexico. We citizen USA. - [Candy] Oh no, I don't think I wanna hear this. - No Mexico, no Mexico. - And I thought you could drive. - [Ellie-Jo] Well, who was reading the map? (speaking foreign language) - [Candy] We should have had this joker with us for the ride. - Okay, come on, come on. (speaking foreign language) - Ow! - Hey, come on, will you? - No, no! - Come on, Candy. - Look, just leave me, okay? I can't, Ellie. Look, you got a chance by yourself. Don't you see? - I don't see nothing but a loser. - I got no choice. - That's what losers say, Candy, and they never make it. - What are you talking about? - Look, if we're in this together, we're in this together. Remember? - Right. - Come on. Come on. - Right. (dramatic music) (horse neighs) Ellie-Jo? Ellie-Jo. (dramatic music) (upbeat music) (mellow music) (mellow music)
