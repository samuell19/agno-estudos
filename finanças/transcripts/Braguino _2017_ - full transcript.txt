I made these dreams with an interval between the two of them. In these dreams, we had left this place. Then I started wondering: "Why did we leave?" Everything was so sweet back home, we left all that. At three hours, to the right. Braguino Oriental Siberia Latitude: 062 51. 047 North 082 01. 140 South All the boys were born here. I was looking for a quiet place, out of the civilization. I took a big boat and I came here. I brought a tent and I started building. He prefers to be in the taiga than in a house. Even when I'm home! When he comes home, he feels uneasy. We only hunt what we need. If you are economical, you can have a good life with some hunting. Or you can hunt a lot and threw half of it away. Why do you keep your mouth open? Somebody will enter your mouth! A bird! I've been walking around here for 40 years. I have never seen the footprint of another man. I never saw a stranger. The nature is virgin. Corrupt people and the Kiline... Stop, why do you mention the Kiline? Who did this? The Kiline... We are on the river Sim. Children come to play on the island. It doesn't belong to anybody. This side is Braguine's territory, he's my father. The fence is in the middle, between the two territories. And this side is the Kiline's territory, the neighbours. When you walk in the forest, you see this incredible beauty, and you don't believe it can disappear. That it may not be anymore. In the taiga, the most dangerous is the man. A man is unpredictable. Sascha built everything here. He destroyed himself. And they, they give us orders. "Don't go here, don't go there..." When we let them come first, we made a mistake. As in the tale "The Fox and The Rabbit"! They shout at us... "We were the first here, not you!" This is what the Kiline say. We lost everything. We shared the land. The upper part is ours, the lower is theirs. But it was not enough for them. They wanted our share too. Now they claim they were the first here. I'll prepare one duck. One duck... It will be my duck. My nasty duck... It will be my duck. I love you, my duck... My nasty duck! It's my duck! I heard them... Yes, they passed nearby. - Who? - The bears. I ran into them one night. - Three bears. - Maybe more. I grabbed my axe and walked toward one. I had no choice. He was coming after me. He may have crushed me! I was facing him. He turned around and left to another direction. We thought about scaring the Kiline. They are afraid of bears. Come on! Will we do it? The Kiline are very afraid of bears still they think they are heroes. They are even afraid of bear cubs. When they are alone, they are afraid of everything. They keep trying to provoke a conflict. They break the fences, pull up the seeds, insult us... If things go on that way, there will be a murder. Walk closer to me. He is hidden somewhere. Where are you going? Not this way... He left! When all the dogs were poisoned... They told Vanya they would poison him. It's easy, the sugar always stays on the table when we are outside. Is he afraid? Are you afraid of the bear? It's old. Yes, it's an old bear. Maybe we should pull him lower. Its gallbladder is strongly fixed. We shouldn't have left him alone on the sand. We will shake is further away. Let's pray for it. Then bury it. We will hold a ceremony. We will sing for its soul. The Kiline own a military listening system. It's when you walk outside. They get the waves and the conversations. They turn on the radios. These are not radios, it's a system with computers. My brother told us it would be tough. "They will chase you away." He is dead now. It was almost a prediction. My hole will be bigger than yours. A hole... I plugged your hole! The Kiline! Vassiliss, what's going on? Stay still. They should have arrived? I saw nobody and didn't hear anything. - The Kiline? - They threw a barbecue. They are waiting for them. - Corrupted... - Poachers. Corrupted. They hunt everything that moves. They know no limit. The taiga can't stand them. There is no elk left. The Kiline say they will do anything for them. They hunt, smoke the fish, host them. They are only taiga occupiers. We live here. Our hunting territory has been bought but corrupted persons. They took a picture of the map. And one day, we discovered that another land had appeared drawn with a pencil. Just like this land had given birth to another one. It never existed on any map. It's totally illegal. These bandit are really close to the Kiline. Because they have the same blood. Wolf blood. There is no contact. OK, try it now. There is a bad contact. Number 2 is connected! Corrupted persons came, there are helicopters everyday. One has just left and another one is coming. If the helicopter arrives, I don't know, maybe it will come later. I saw it today in my dream. Here it is, a bear is hiding! Close your eyes! - You, what do you want? - Nothing. You wanted us to offer you a watermelon? You land here and... Give him a watermelon, he will be happy. Did we come to your land? Yes, my village. What is it here? Your village? OK, you go back there! Or is your village here? You turn off your camera! We are the owners of this land. We have papers for this land. Who are you? Get lost! I now this is illegal. Illegal? You mean I'm a criminal? Where did you get that idea? He told you to shut the fuck up. Didn't you understand? Get lost and don't come back here! You shut the fuck up, damn! I'm gonna crush you! They act like they are home. They come and leave just as they like. We had never seen so many guns. He said he had a shotgun with an optical sight. But each of them has at least three. We were given 3 or 4 licenses to kill games. But they can fill their helicopter up! They transport it with several boats. What law is this? We were all born here. And strangers come to tell us it is their land. It's going to end badly. Soon, there will be only one solution left. Soon, we will be at war. Maybe there is no satellite... Hello. Sergei Vasilievich? This is Braguine. Can you hear me? Sergei Vasilievich, why... Sergei Vasilievich, what was that helicopter? A whole gang came here. Who authorized them? They threatened us again, with guns. Ask him... How come they came once again? Hello? Did he hang up? Hello? They hanged up. - Nobody's taking the call? - No. - Do you hear something? - No. I don't trust nobody anymore. Up to where will the hunters go? Did many of them go? They are somewhere in the forest. Before they started to come here, I dreamt twice that we had left this place. After these dreams, it started. Corrupted persons came here. 1 calling 2. I don't hear anything. I hear the thunder. What, "1 calling 2"? Who are you, "1 calling 2"? I don't understand you. I will sing for you... 1 calling 2, I will sing for you... The sky is howling... I am soaked. I'm covered with mud, my friend. Bring me your gun. Now, big things are going to happen. Subtitles: tadanobu@KG
