Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Good morning and welcome, it's a beautiful day in the city temperatures rising to eight degrees this weekend and Yours Truly has never felt better. Speaking of the weekend, the big moment is finally here. Iceland versus England, our girls. I have a feeling something big is going to happen. All cars to Borgartun! Bank raid in progress. - Suspect heading towards the freeway. - On it old girl! I've got her! Buckle up, Klemenz. I'm gonna floor this piece of junk. Slow down, man! Watch out for that car! - It's a red light. It's a red light, Bussi!! - We're cops! This is car 8, Klemenz here. It's impossible to be in a car with this goddamned maniac! Wait! Hey, she went into the mall! She has to come out somewhere. Out? Be careful! What are you doing? That's a no right turn! That's a no right turn here! - We're cops, Klemenz! - For fuck's sake! You can't turn here! You can't turn here, Bussi! Did you see who that was? It's that girl from that band. You're going to end up in jail for killing innocent civilians! - Shut up, Klemenz! - This is not OK! Slow down, man, there's a child in the car! All good? Diddi, sweety, it's gonna be all right! We'll get you to preschool as soon as we can and then Mommy will come and pick you up. - Take the wheel, Klemenz! - What? - Take the wheel! - Bussi! Bussi, get back inside! Fuck! It's always the same with you! You have no respect for the rules! You humiliated me at the staff party. Pulled my pants down in the cafeteria and now I'm sitting here in your fucking deathtrap! Suspect is approaching Gardabaer, all Reykjavik vehicles stand down! Fuck! Roger. Stop the car! We're not entering Gardabaer's jurisdiction. We're not breaking any more rules. Hördur will take this one. I'll take it from here, cityboy. Look at that jerk. Bussi, no. I'm begging you. Bussi, we'll get fired. We're not going into Gardabaer's jurisdiction, I'll lose my job. Fuck it, I'm going in. Stop the car! We need to be a team now, son. You and me. Just turn on the ipad and stay put Daddy will be right back. Bussi! OK, Klemenz, I'll go right and you go through there. - Bussi! - Klemenz, get your ass in there! - Are you lost, buddy? - I'm not your buddy. No, you're outside your jurisdiction, so stay out of my way, Citycop. If you think I'm letting you take credit for this you're mistaken. Bussi! - Bussi! - For fuck's sake! Bussi! - OK, here's how we... - Bussi! So, what do we do now? You put down your gun or it's game over for your partner! You would only be doing me a favour. Bussi, now is not the time! Put down your fucking gun or this guy's had his last donut! Bingo. You shot me, you asshole! Bussi, you're the toughest cop in Reykjavik, how does it feel to be a hero? Hero? Do you know what that gets you? High blood pressure, a pat on the back and a discount at Starbucks. But I'm a cop. I don't know anything else. I'm fucking innocent! No one's innocent in this godforsaken town! Hey, I want my phone call! Bussi, look who's on TV. What shall I do, make popcorn? Congrats. You just won a travel prize. - To where? - To hell. Everyone knows that Bussi is the toughest cop in town. He has his own way of doing things but he gets the job done. You have a right to shut the fuck up. Everything you say will be used against you in a court of law. Call your lawyer. But the toughest cop in town has met his match. The new guy in Gardabaer, the flavour of the month, Hördur Bess. Hördur, you have plenty of money, why are you doing this? Someone needs to keep Gardabaer looking sharp. We don't want it to end up a slum. Like Reykjavik. Fucking Gardabaer. What's up, Hördur? Here for the paperwork? Good one. How many busts have you made this year? Who's counting? I'm counting. You're the man, Hördur. He's is not only rich and handsome, his IQ is well above average, and he's fluent in 15 languages. Hey, be careful! Shut your mouth, asshole! Son of a bitch. Except Danish. On principal. No longer the toughest cop in town, huh? Hördur Bess is Iceland's most eligible bachelor and defines himself as pansexual. What turns me on? A sexy soul. Jesus, enough of this bullshit. Jón, what is the the real situation? It's hard to say. We were left with an empty tank and the drive has been tough. But we're hoping to be able to turn things around. Bussi, come in here. Worst case scenario is that we will have to dig into the Central Bank's gold reserves, but I'm hoping it won't come to that. It doesn't make any sense. Breaking in to a bank and not steal a damn cent. This is the third bank in a row! What the hell is going on? Have you seen the security footage? Yes, I'm looking at it now... What the hell is she doing? Sit. I'll talk to you later, Jón. Bussi. Chaos at the mall. A kid with a broken leg. Two tires blown. 700 dollars worth of damage and you know I have the Prime Minister on my ass. - The Prime Minister's a clown. - Bussi, I'm still here. - Did you want to see me? - Sit down, Klemenz. And you went outside city limits without permission, - with a kid in the back seat. - Yeah, my kid. Obstructed Hördur Bess and shot Donut here in the shoulder. - My name is Klemenz. - Not a peep from you. He's alive, isn't he? ''He's alive isn't he?'' Listen to him. It's impossible to be near him, let alone work with him! He creates a bad atmosphere, destroys morale and breeds apathy in the office. It's just a little flesh wound. Why are you even wearing a sling? I'm wounded. I'm supposed to wear it for two days, doctor's orders. Guys, get the hell out! Did your brain get frostbite when you were searching for that hunter? Out! Jesus fucking Christ. Fucking Reykjavik. The Icebank. So... Well.. Everything, really. I mean, I don't even know when I should start tomorrow or where. And will I be picked up? I don't have a car. Are you, Thröstur? Do you have a car? Do you have a car? And, well, these overalls. Mine don't fit. I'm XL. These are 2XL. Way too big. It would have been great to get a spreadsheet. Like a floor plan like when we were working at the hydro plant back in the day, just so I know what I'm supposed to do. I don't have a clue what this is. What does this even do? Long day at the office? Yes. Reykjavík isn't an innocent little town any more. - Another one. - Aren't you driving? Am I the cop here or are you? Another one. Bussi, I saw you on TV earlier, the robbery, what a mess. It's good to have the best cop in town living in my building. Maybe it's not so bad to have someone with a gun, just in case. - Right. - Uncle Bussi! How is my favorite girl? - Do you know what this does? - Shoots bad guys? That's right, you little genius. - Do you want to hold it? - Bussi, no. Next time, when Dad isn't looking. Hey, you still owe me rent. Can you pay now? I made a lucky bet this week so I put a little extra in there. Great, thank you, Bussi, - Get yourselves something nice. We will. Sigridur, do you want to say good night to uncle Bussi? Good night. That's right, Heidar Eastman with top music here at Pop FM. What's the deal with these crazy bank people? Two banks, nothing stolen. Bussi and the cops are just running in circles and not connecting the dots. To me, it's obvious. They're not stealing.. Hi. ..something bigger is happening. More is coming, count on it. And I can tell you that detective Eastman has solved the case, the next break in will happen in the next few days. Haven't you had enough tonight? - It was a long day. - So you needed a Jager? - You looked good on TV. - Thanks. - Stop being such a bore, Bussi. - Yeah. I missed you today. I'm sorry, I'm just not in the mood. What's wrong with you, Bussi? Why are you so distant? Distant? We never kiss anymore, Never hold hands, and we haven't slept together in 3 months. We never talk anymore. Can you put that fucking ticket down? What are we doing right now? Aren't we talking? - You know, I can't even talk to you. - Right. You're not even looking at me. Look, I can't handle this now. Can we do this tomorrow? Call me tomorrow if you want to talk. - Otherwise, don't bother. - Right. - Hi, it's Maggi. - How are you, Maggi? Good. That's good. Did you have fun? Third place. Did you get a medal? - Yeah, of course. - You're getting good at this. I'm the best. - So when should we play? - Soon. Do you think you can beat your big brother? - Of course! You know me. - Yes, I know you. I'm going to get back to my dinner. Keep on killing all the bad guys. - Totally. - We'll talk again tomorrow. Ok, bye. I love you, Höddi. I love you too, buddy. Stop it. Are you a cop or what? I said, are you a cop or what? What are you doing? Yes, good morning, I would like to check my balance. Yes, it's 060877-4529. Yes, 2418. Yes, we're on fire here at FM on this summer's day, and we'll be giving away two tickets to Saturday's game. The stadium will be packed, our girls playing. Everything hangs on this game. Are you thirteen? Why can't you drink coffee like a grown-ass man, you seal? Why can't I just drink what I want? Why can't I buy a beverage and drink it and you just mind your own damn business? Sitting here, drinking every fluid on the planet. - Fill her up. - Sure. - You were awesome on TV yesterday. - Ok. Suddenly everyone owns a TV in this part of town. Wait, are you saying I'm maxed out? How about the credit card? Closed, yeah? All right, thanks for that. I can't do this any more. We're police officers! Enough is enough. You're embarrassing yourself. Get out! I'm driving now or I'm not coming. All vehicles, armed robbery at the Icebank, all vehicles respond. - Ok, see ya... - Bussi. Bussi! Bussi! We're coming to you live from outside the Icebank on East Street. The entire police force is here. This is a serious situation, there are hostages inside, but we don't yet know the number of hostages, or of their captors. - What's the status? - It's very sensitive. Six armed suspects, five hostages, we have snipers on the rooftops. Hördur Bess is inside and Softy is trying to mediate. - Bess? Is this a beauty pageant? - Oh Bussi. Wait, he's coming out. Chief, I tried every trick in the book, they can't be reasoned with. For fuck's sake, I'm going in. Bussi, you're not going in. I need to increase my overdraft. Are you going to let him get away with this? Full bank, is it the first of the month? Am I at the casino? What's an out-of-town-boy like you doing here? Is Kenny Rogers having a concert? Me? What are you doing here? Isn't it happy hour? Your gym just called, you're late for your spin class. By the way, you could use a spin class yourself. Fuck off. I counted six guys with machine guns. I'm going to surprise them on the teller's side. What's your plan for this guy? Do you think he's just texting his wife what's for dinner? Well spotted. Don't fuck this up like last time. Let's go. - Need an Advil for the headache? - What headache? This one. Any ideas? Yeah, kill the last guy. Nice. I have a hostage. I will kill her. I will kill her if you come any closer. Easy, no one is killing anyone. Except me. - What's the situation? - Well, looks like it's eight-nil. Did you kill all of them? Not all of them. Get her ass down to the station. Softy. - Would you like coffee? - Cigarettes. No. There's no smoking here. You need to tell me the everything. From A-Z. It's very important. Why did you send in the choir boy? - No really, it's... - Out! This isn't psychology 101. Is he drinking alcohol at work? No. He's spitting it over her. Why don't you steal anything? You know I've been drinking today. They don't teach that at the academy. Clean this up. Why don't you steal anything? We don't want money. Why don't you want money? You'll find out on Saturday. What do you mean, on Saturday? What will we find out on Saturday? Go Iceland. You broke my finger. You can have this one. In the past two minutes he has broken every rule in the book. This isn't a movie. Hey, these are some pretty rough... What? How are you? - We were a good team today. - Sure. What are you doing here, why aren't you in Gardabaer? Thorgerdur wanted a report from me and I thought I'd see if you wanted to go for a drink? Yeah, sure, I'm heading to the bar anyway, you can jump in. Alright! - Two Jagermeisters. - Alright, hun. Three break-ins but nothing stolen. What are we missing? I have to admit, I don't get it. This is very strange. This case must be thrilling for you. Not a lot of criminals in your part of town. More than you might think. They just wear suits, unlike the drunks in your part of town. Fair point. I have to admit, you were alright today. We could damn well use someone like you downtown. Whoa, wait. Was that a compliment from Bussi the Supercop? Easy now... I'm going to... ...take a leak. - Allright, hun. I'll join you. So, does the toughest cop in Reykjavik have time for a woman in his life? Well... It's complicated. Should we have another one? Sure. What are you doing? What the fuck? You wanted to see me? Sit. We're being taken for fools here. I have the whole damn department knee-deep in this bank case. And still we don't have any leads. And then there's this damned game on Saturday. Like I can spare the manpower to babysit a fucking football match. We need to get the wheels turning. Get all hands on deck. Óskar and I were talking and we're going to unite our departments temporarily while we solve this case. What do you mean? You have a new partner, Bussi. - Good morning. - Hi. What's pretty boy doing here? Good to see you again. You two share 50/50 of arrests in this town. You're the best of the best. And everyone knows it. But this is not a competition. You have to work together. I have a partner, Donut back there. I don't need a new one. Is there a U in shove? Bussi, he doesn't want to work with you anymore. He just filed a complaint about workplace bullying. You shot him. This is done, Hördur Bess is your new partner. God fucking damn it! One more thing. Stefania is being released today, tail her. He's a bit sensitive. We listen to Rock FM in this car. We had a good time last night. What are you talking about? Don't act like you don't remember. It was getting hot there at the end. Wait, that actually happened? I thought it was a bad dream. Anyway, I blacked out. I don't remember anything. If you want to chat about this over a coffee, we can do that. Even Pop FM is better than your bullshit. So, we're all racking our brains over these break-ins. I mean, who breaks in to a bank but doesn't steal anything? There's something fishy going on and if I were a cop I'd be studying the bank's security footage to see what they were actually doing inside these banks, and if they're not stealing money, then what? But what do I know? I'm just a radio DJ. Here on Pop FM. Rikki. He's back. Who's Rikki? An old colleague from my modelling days. This is not good. Top music here at Pop FM, The weather today has been rather nice, it’s warm in Reykjavík but the forecast is not so great... Ladies and gentlemen... I didn't tell them anything, I didn't tell them anything, Rikki! Why doesn't he just speak Icelandic? I mean, should we answer in English or Icelandic when he talks to us? Shut your motherfucking mouth. ...National team game, it's all on. Something's happening tomorrow. But where will it be? Uptown? Downtown? If I were a bank security guard.. That won't happen. Didn't you just tell me to shut up and now you're coughing? He has a gun. Me? What am I supposed to do? Wanna get some fresh air? Go outside for a minute? Yes, yes. The water, over here, Thröstur! We really need to clean up a bit here, it's a total mess. Over here, the water! No ok. What's going on? Fuck! You Ok? You good? Me? I call myself Scorpion. Well, I was named Svavar. They all just call me Svavar, it's my real name. We can't always shoot half the crew in the middle of a job. No, we need him whole tomorrow. She's right, I'm better whole tomorrow. Sure. Fat chance I'm going to remind him to kill me. Something big is about to go down on Saturday, but what do I know, I'm not a cop. I just know that if I was going to rob something, Saturday would be perfect. Ten thousand people at the game and empty streets. Hello! Heidar Eastmann. He's actually a great radio DJ. A new bank raid tomorrow, and a new hour of top music with Heidar Eastmann. Don't let that beautiful smile fool you. Rikki is very dangerous. How well do you know him? We were model buddies. The two hottest models. Then he had a terrible accident and got fried from the neck down. Then he just disappeared. Ok. You weren't kidding. Damn, you were fit back then. Hi, guys. - How's the investigation going? - Fine. What do you need? Nothing, just curious. Any leads? It's just a guy we think might be connected to the robberies. Is this the guy behind it? We're looking into it, but, yes, it looks like it. Thorgerdur. Do you have a moment? Spit it out, Klemenz. It's just.. Regarding my raise.. You know full well that it's not possible at the moment. I can't make ends meet from this. Siggi needs braces, training fees are high, I can't do it. Right. And your wife needs to go to the mall. Look, if it's not about the case then I don't want to hear it. Thorgerdur. We're all under pressure and funding was cut this year. My hands are tied. My name is Heidar Eastmann, thank you for listening today. It's been a very good day, it's... Who are you? Who are you working for? I don't know anything. I just read stuff online and... There's probably no one listening anyway. What? I don't know what you're talking about. I don't even know who you are. I don't know anything. I'm just a radio DJ. You've surfed your last airwave. Ok, listen up. Rikki Ferrari. This is our guy. Remember this face. Rikki is an ex-model. We used to work together. At Eskimo Models? - Exactly. - Yes. He moved abroad when his career took off but unfortunately it all ended... Here. After the accident, he snapped. Now he's an extremely dangerous, bat-shit crazy sociopath. I talked to my guys at Interpol and they confirmed that Rikki did time for bank robbery in Panama. Well, it's clear that this guy could use a few sessions with a psychologist, and when we catch him, I volunteer for that. Yeah, Ok, whatever. Just so you know what we're up against, someone at the bank looked at Rikki sideways and he snapped. He plucked the guy's eyes out with a pocket knife, gave him his sunglasses and took a selfie.. And posted it on Instagram. Oh my God! The man is sick. Doesn't he have loads of followers? Did any of you guys eat? I thought there would be some food this morning. Like fruit or sandwiches. There wasn't even coffee. You know, I'm not asking a lot, but this just feels cheap. Shut up and drive! Armed robbery at the mall! All units go! They're at the parking cellar. Hördur, Bussi, get your asses down there. On it, old girl. Who is this guy, Jackie Chan? He is incredibly good looking. Not sure I want to mess him up. Get in! OK, go go go!! Couldn't they even get us a car with a working clutch? Fuck! Omar has the chip. What? They can't get it, remember what Rikki said. Relax. They won't get it. Did you find anything? This was the only thing we could salvage from the bag. It's toast, we can't get any information from it. Maybe you guys can use it. Good luck. I might have an idea. Loa, it's Bess, Hördur Bess. I'm on a case and I need help. Can you meet me and my partner? Long time no see, Hördur. What happened to you? Long story. I have a USB chip I need you to look at for me. Ok. Move. This isn't good. What? It's a virus. Encrypted. I need to crack the drive without downloading it. Ok. Can you do it? Can I do it? Can the Renegade Raider crank 90's and box like a fish? What? Give me that. How long will this take? - Give me two days. - Two days? We need this now. Tell this drunk asshole to chill, it takes as long as it takes. Loa, we're under a lot of pressure. Yeah, Ok. Well, I can at least tell you where this drive came from. Ok, where? Chinatown. Chinatown? Do you really live here? No, I'm taking you to my uncle's house. Of course I live here. Not so lucky with the betting lately? Hey, Bussi. It's a bit late. Yeah, you know your way around Chinatown, right? Yes, why? We need to go there tonight and we need someone who knows his way around the place. To help us find where this came from. Bussi, it's really late. This will only take an hour. I promise. Please. Hallway. You clean the hallway tomorrow. What? I'll help you if you clean the hallway tomorrow. For the first time. Yeah, Ok. Hákon, can you watch Sigridur for a bit, I won't be long. An hour or so. Bye. Hi. Get the fuck out of Chinatown. Yes, that's me. Is this familiar? - No, where did you get it? - We're asking the questions here. Don't tell them anything. Get rid of them. Don't tell us anything about what? - I can't talk about this here. - Tell us what you know. - You don't understand. - What? Hey, Icelandic please. - It's a trojan. A virus. - Trojan. What do you mean? You have to go. They're watching us. Who is? Is everyone ok? No no no no. I need an ambulance in Chinatown. Gunshot wound, move it! The sniper's getting away. What do you want to do? You go, I'll stay. - Bussi, Bussi.. - Don't talk. Just stay awake, the ambulance is coming. No, Bussi, Sigridur. Look after her for me. I promise. Out of the way! Out of the way! Out of the way! Out of the way! Perfect. Where are they? Well? Don't you have anything to say? Jon, it's been a long night. We're all tired. You don't have to tell me what a long night this has been. I am utterly fed up with Beavis and Butthead over there. Give me one reason I shouldn't fire you on the spot. They're my best detectives, you know I can't lose them. Do you have any idea how much it will cost to rebuild Chinatown? And not just that.. How many police cars have you blown up? How many restaurants demolished? And that stork you shot at the city pond in front of those pre-schoolers. You drove a bus full of civilians into the opera house. Trashed the amusement park. What is the matter with you? Are you insane? This is the last time I'm going to clean up your mess. If you so much as break a pencil at the station, you will end up on traffic duty in Bumblefuck, Missouri. Bumblefuck. Do you even know where that is? I'm not having this clown tell me how to be a cop. If this circus act is over I'm leaving. Can we have him assasinated? Bussi. Bussi, wait! What? I know you just lost your friend. Why don't you come over? We can have a glass of wine and talk. - Because I'm not interested. - Bussi. I'm not interested. Hey, I thought we were partners. We're nothing. Bad guy. Bad guy. Bad guy. Bad guy. Bad guy. - Hi. - Hi. Thanks for coming over. Are you ok? Did something happen? I just... Bussi, what's going on? Isn't this what you wanted? Yes, but is this what you want? I can't just be someone you turn to when you feel bad. This is not a normal relationship. It never has been. I can't fight with you now. Not today. Me neither. Maybe it's time for you to admit the truth. For my sake and for yours. What are you talking about? I think I know why you've been so distant lately. I don't need to admit anything, not to you or to myself. Bussi. We're just going round in circles here. I can't do this anymore. - Then get the fuck out. - Yeah. Hey. Hi. I... I don't know what's wrong with me. Bussi, there's nothing wrong with you. Kiss me. - Did you see these photos? - No. Wait, what am I looking at? That white van, it's been parked at the stadium for four days. We checked who's inside it. She's working for Rikki. We arrested her the other day. You have to do something. We need increased security on Saturday. Wait, just because they parked a car next to the stadium? Look, this is no coincidence. Rikki is planning something big. We can't take any chances. There will be ten thousand people there. We'll need all available units at the game. Every available officer. Thank you, Klemenz. I'll look into it. Rikki. Bussi and Hördur? The toughest cops in town? This is not what we talked about. The price just got higher. Is this high enough for you? What the hell!? Yes. Where's your boyfriend? Do you mean girlfriend? We broke up. Rikki Ferrari. I don't have time for this shit. What do you want? Release? What do you mean? The Sun, The Times, Good Housekeeping. Your mom's bookclub's groupchat. Bussi boy, this is a blackmail. Capiche? Has anyone seen Hördur? No. Meet me at noon in front of the bakery. I fancy a muffin. I look forward to seeing you. With love. Rikki Ferrari. - I quit. - What? - You heard me, I quit. - Don't be ridiculous, Bussi. You're a cop, you don't know how to be anything else. One Jager. Sure. Where have you been, you look like shit. None of your business. - Another one. - No, you've had enough. - Another one. - You heard me. Who are you, my mom? Fuck, you're so annoying. Ok, none of that. - What are you doing? - Is this your beer? Bussi. - Guys, over here. - Want me to throw you in jail? Where am I? Hey man, do you know the score of today's semi-final? One - one. Good day everyone. We're coming to you from the national stadium. Game day, finally! At last, our women's team's big moment is here. We have to defeat this giant of an English team to secure a place in the World Cup. It's going to be an uphill climb from start to finish. Well, folks, it's time. Iceland - England, here we go. We need to be organized and monitor all the gates. No vehicle is to enter the area without my authorisation, copy? Where is Bussi, has anyone heard from him? What's this, the 4th of July? Goddamnit. Hey, kids, are you old enough to be drinking beer? Give it to me. - Got any tobacco? - Shut up, old fart. Hey, do you want me to have the cops come and get you? All the cops are at the game, fuckface. - Wait, what did you say? - He said fuckface. I'm not talking to you, asshole, what did you say about the cops? - We can kick your ass if we want to. - The cops are busy at the game. Thorgerdur. There's something you need to see. Come with me. Play it. - It's a bomb. - Fuck. Plus extra time. - We need to call... - Shut up. We can't just... Well, hello... - Has anyone found Bussi? - He's not picking up. Damn that man. Where is he when I need him? Yes. Hi, it's Loa. Is Hördur with you? I can't reach him. - No. - Ok, never mind. I've accessed the files on the USB chip. Ok, did you find anything? - It's a powerful trojan. A virus. - A virus? Is that it? It's used to attack security systems. Close the gate. No one leaves. Halli, call the bomb squad. Copy. See you in five. This is no ordinary virus. If the trojan is infecting the systems of all the big banks, they can fry them all at the same time and crash the main security grid. And what happens if the main security grid crashes? It will all be open. All what? Everything. Banks, databases, firewalls, you name it. They can crash airplanes if they want. They can walk into any bank and... ...hoover everything up. Even the Central Bank. Who robs a bank and doesn't steal a fucking cent? - Why don't you want money? - We'll see on Saturday. The cops are busy at the game. Worst case scenario we dig in to the Central Bank's gold reserves. They didn't steal anyting, Bussi, because they haven't started yet. Fuck. The game's just a decoy. Like in Die Hard 3. Kate is here. What's the status? Have they found the bomb? No. My people are still looking. Be ready on stand by. We're almost at half-time, so time is short. - Where the hell is Bussi? - I'll go and find him. No, Klemenz, I need you here. We'll finish this. Hey, Thröstur. I've been thinking, hasn't the coordination here been shit. Like the gold bars, do we carry them out one by one? Or do we use wheelbarrows? And where do I get those? A single bar weighs 25 kg, no joke. It's going to take forever to carry them out one by one. And blowing up the stadium? What, burn ten thousand people? I didn't sign up for that. To be honest, I think Rikki is a very domineering and unpleasant guy. Hi. Do you mean the other day when you said were going to kill me when the job was done? The job isn't done! - What was that? - Thorgerdur, we found it. Fuck. - We have to evacuate the stadium. - No, we can't. Thorgerdur, there are ten thousand lives at stake here. I know very well what is at stake here. Do you think we can do this? Yes. - Hey hey hey! - I thought we were a team, asshole. What do you mean? We are a team. I saw you with Rikki. I saw him kissing you and I heard his message on your iPAd. He has Maggi, my brother. He threatened to kill him if I didn't quit the force. Ok, I thought... He's been playing us. And obviously it worked. - So you two aren't... - No. Rikki isn't my type. I mean you two aren't working together? Working together? I'm here to save my brother, isn't that obvious. Do you know how many they are? I counted fifteen. Do you have a plan? Yes. Fuck them up and save Maggi. The atmosphere here at the stadium is electric. That's not a plan, but fuck it. 35 minutes to go... - Hallbera has the ball on the left... - Turn that up. ...passes to Sveindis.. Sveindis goes for the goal, - she takes one on and scores! - Yes! We're in the game! - One more! - Sveindis Jane scores for Iceland. Come on, girls! Are you seriously betting right now? No, I'm not betting right now. I bet yesterday. - Do you have any guns? - No. We're heading for a warehouse gunfight and I didn't bring guns. Klemenz? What are you doing here? I never thought I'd say this, but man, am I glad to see you. Are Thorgerdur and Halli with you? No, it's just me. Just you? Ok, get down, we need you. Guns up. Klemenz, what's going on? Get us down from here. I'm so sorry Bussi, I don't know what I've done, man. You fucking rat. Bussi, I'm so sorry, man. I don't know. Where the fuck is Maggi? Eat shit. What is wrong with you? What's the score? Two-two. - Fuck! Don't worry. They're all dying... With excitement. Do you think we'll make it? - I need a few minutes. - You have eleven and a half. Leave him alone. No problem. - We'll start with you then, yes? - Kiss my ass. Shit. We're done here. Hey, look. Maggi is probably up there. Bad guy. Ok, Hördur, before we do this, there's one thing I have to say to you. I'm sorry for the way I've been acting, man. Don't stress. If you're not ready then you're not ready. I want to be honest, especially with you. It's just complicated, I'm Bussi, the toughest fucking cop in Iceland. Iceland? - Don't you mean Reykjavík? - If that helps you sleep. Hördur, I didn't get to finish what I wanted to say. Just say it. Bussi, it's not complicated. Just spit it out. It's not that simple. I don't know who I am any more. I'm a complete mess. I've been fighting my feelings for thirty years. I'm afraid to let them out. Dude, newsflash. It's 2021, no one gives a shit. Fuck it. Hördur, I love you! Damn, that felt good. You're gay, Bussi, that's all. Are you going to arrest me for that? I might have to bring out the handcuffs later. - How many are there left? - Four. - Split them? - Deal. - Hördur. - Are you all right Maggi? - Yes. - Ok, come on, lets go. Maggi, wait here. I'll be back for you. Rikki, show yourself, it's over. What? No. Quit the bullshit Rikki. Let's finish this. What's up, Bussi boy? - Is that a tear? - A tear? No, I'm good. - Where's your boyfriend? - Right here. - Oh, two queens at the party. - Put down your gun, pretty boy. Whoa, whoa... Stop this nonsense now. We don't want any trouble. Put your guns down, no one's going to die here today. Klemenz, what were you thinking, you idiot? I'm sorry, Bussi. I needed the money, I had to. I'm sorry, I've betrayed you all. - It's Ok. Are you alright? - I think I'm dying. No, you're not dying, Klemenz, he shot you in the shoulder. I'm dying, Bussi. I can see the light. Klemenz, he shot you in the shoulder. You're not dying. - I'm going... - Are you kidding, Klemenz! Go after him. Go and kill the son of a bitch. - If I die, I die. - Oh, for god's sake. Go. Don't think about me. Fuck. This game is killing me, it's like a time bomb. It's this one. Are you sure? Are you asking me to dance? Going on holiday? Is this foreplay? Sorry.. You're not my type. - Are you crazy, we need to get out of here. - Shut up. We're not going anywhere. Thorgerdur, you can't do this, the stadium's full, we have to evacuate. Shut up! It's over, asshole. Thorgerdur! Halli! If this bomb won't kill you, then I will. Unless you shut.. The fuck.. Up! You're crazy! What do you say to... ...bit of fingering? Should I tickle your balls too? Your shitty comments don't hurt me any more. I've come to terms with it. Ok, Bussi, baby. A goodbye kiss then. Thanks for the dance. Bad guy. Sara pushes forward, she's in. She's taken down! It's a penalty! It's a penalty! This is our chance to secure the three points we need here today!! Dude. What's the hold up? So, Rikki, did I light your fire? Goal! Sara scores! We're going to the World Cup!! It's all a misunderstanding. I was forced into this. I want a meeting on Tuesday. Bussi. A boat. A warehouse. The Central Bank. The damage is two thousand dollars. Attaboy! I couldn't have done it without Hördur. Yes, how is the dream team? Partners for good? I want to unite our departments permanently. Are you serious? Partners? Partners? So much more than partners. Bussi. - Lilja, what are you doing here? - I saw the news, are you Ok? Yes, I'm Ok. But we need to talk. We should have talked a long time ago. Bussi, you don't have to explain. I just want you to be happy. Well, I think I might just be getting there. Shut. The fuck. Up. Jón, we found the container. Three tons of gold inside and a meatstew underneath. - Here down at the harbor. - Fantastic. Tell the guys I'm proud of them. But not too proud... ...I still dont like them that much. Hey clown, you are on speaker. Oh fuck. Welcome. We're coming to you from Gardabaer, where the supercops Bussi and Hördur live in this incredible villa, with their adopted daughter, Sigridur. Let's pay them a visit. Hello. Well, if it isn't television's most handsome presenter. - Can I come in? - Yes, come on. This is amazing. Hördur, this house is amazing. Who's the one with the great taste? Who do you think? I can't get over how grand this place is. And this must be the main room in the house, right? This is definitely my favourite spot. - What a terrace! - Yes. And the apron, you are careful with the details. Yes. We're keeping this simple, stake and salmon. This is all just amazing. What was that? That's just Bussi doing target practice with Sigridur. Hold it straight. Watch for the kick, it's nothing to worry about. And shoot. Right. Raising the next generation of supercops? Well, we're not going to be teaching her to play football, we have to teach her something. Ok. Some might make do with a trampoline and grill. A shooting range is not something you normally see. No, we're not like everyone else. What do the neighbours say? It must get loud? They haven't complained yet. Nobody messes with this team. You have a right to shut the fuck up! Everything you say will be used against you in a court of law. That's game over for you, man. TRANSLATION BY ERNA GUDMUNDSDOTTIR
