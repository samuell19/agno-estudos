The German Friend My father used to tell me, how he and my mother went to the Argentinian official and wanted to call me Sulamit. The civil servant said: "The name doesn't exist in Argentina." "The girl will be called Susana." Then father laughed warmly. "And yet you're called Sulamit." My father had a marzipan factory. He used only the best ingredients. Almonds imported from France. Then he couldn't sell it anymore, too expensive. The house he'd built was too big and expensive, too. It was similar to the one across the street. Hello Friedrich! - Hello! Pat! Pat! In it goes! - Quick, quick! Pat! Drive off! Mum, they took Pat! - What? In a van, me and the neighbour ran for it! We've got to save him. What are you saying? What neighbour? Friedrich, from the German School. We must call the police! It's Pat! Got any cash? Let's see. Give me the dog! - Yours for 20 pesos. Look, please! I called, they'll investigate, as promised. Don't be sad, darling. It'll work out. I told you the cargo needs to be checked. The shipps already been there for two days. Hey, boy? - Where are the dogs, where's Pat? I've got the money. - Sorry, boy. Things happen fast here. Take one of those. - No! What do I do now? Come on Sulamit. Let's go for a drive. I'll let you drive. Dare taking the main street, my little Fangio? Excellent. Now move over, I'll go to the butcher's. Hello, Herr Schiff. - Hello, Herr Löwenstein. Hello. Let's go. Why don't you greet the neighbours? How do you know them? I know their son Friedrich. They're from across the street! We're going home. Take the meat. Let me show you where I always hang out. Where were you? - Opposite. With the Germans? No, with Friedrich. But these people are German. Friedrich is Argentinian, like me. Yes, sure. Good night, dad. Copied everything on the blackboard? Got it all? Shut your books. Everyone go to religious studies now. Miss Löwenstein, ethics is cancelled. The teacher's ill, you may go home. Yes, I know. I didn't ask for your comment. In the ruins of a silent palace, memory, I look for you. Behind the walls and cobwebs of memory, I find you, and everything changes, places and objects. Come every afternoon, if you wish. Sorry to disturb you. I need to get to the winter clothes. Mum, this is Sulamit. Sulamit, my mother. Pleasure. You're the girl from across the street? Yes. I've got to leave. It's getting late. Interesting girl. May I? You shouldn't smoke, dad. I'm not smoking. Friedrich asks me to come to the Tigre Delta. We'll go by boat, him and his family. Don't you always say I should be out in the fresh air more? My clever girl. May I go? Closer together. A photo of you toasting. I'm coming! Put half of it here, right? Take the plates from the cupboard over there. What are you doing! What's it doing here? Give that to me! What's this? What is it doing here? What do you think? It's a bread basket. And this? That? It's a decor. A relic from other times. Come on, boy. Take the sausages to the table. Since Philipp isn't here no one would do it. He's turning pious, after all. Delicious. - Lovely. Come in, you don't celebrate Chanukkah without kids. Sorry, haven't got time. Let her go. She's always out, now Philipp's ill. She prefers celebrating Christmas with... the neighbours. - Let her do Chrismukkah, then. Christmas and Chanukkah. - Together. That's how you do it. How is it? The apple strudel's gone. They ate lots, as usual. I didn't even get a taste. Wait. I have something for you. She never stops telling these old stories. This ring used to belong to your great aunt Sulamit. It's for you. For me? You got your name from her. Why do we never talk about her? Because it's difficult. Perhaps she could've been saved. If only she'd not been so stubborn. I shouldn't talk so much. I'm just a bit meshugge. You're not, aunt! You can talk to me about anything, always. Sorry. At long last, Horst. Now we can start. Go back inside, please stay inside the house. ...the people united shout from their heart: Viva Perón! My school mates say you should pray in church, if someone's ill. That's right, but we go to synagogue. Isn't it the same? - It's not the right moment. How dare they bombard people... - And worse! What's going on? - Perón's being sent to...exile There's a military coup! And the surgeon, the doctors? They're with your husband. Don't leave the building! Evita was right: the people should've been armed. The smell was so nice when dad smoked. He was the best father you can imagine. Shouldn't we sit down there? Shut up. Don't question everything. It's your dad's Kaddish. It's why we belong down front! I don't understand a word, anyway. Moving already? Can I help? We're almost done, can't you see? For you. It's Borges. Shut the doors. Let's go. I'm still at work when you get home from school. Right, mum. That's the right way round. Aunt Else says state school isn't that bad. Of course it's not the Collège Français. I shan't miss the Monsieurs and Mademoiselles. Don't worry. Just Friedrich, now he lives so far away. Up in the sky a warrior eagle rises up into the air in proud flight. One wing blue, like the colour of the sky... Hold it! It's been in all the papers! We're allowed an opinion? - Calm down! Why don't you write the piece? Right, you do it. Luis and I will write on Eichmann's kidnap. It'll be an entertaining issue. "Espolón" as a Jewish mouthpiece. Not bad. How do you mean? - Is it just a Jewish concern, fascists knifing a female student? Shall we have a pizza? Yes, hunger, hunger... When can I see you at home? Just finished. At my school we couldn't do this. We never mention the Nazis. I mean... Watch what you write. Why, you'll protect me. Be here every Wednesday! Agreed! Why aren't you eating? I had Pizza. With Friedrich. It's Pessach in 2 days. On Seder night we'll see the Feldmans. You'll meet the youngsters from the community. According to you, every guy who comes near me must drop his trousers to demonstrate he's circumcised. Don't be rude. Dirty Jew! We'll stop your filthy scribbles. Take this! - See? We'll slit you up. - No warning, next time! Let's go! - What are you doing, leave her! Are you mad? You alright? - Yes, thanks. Sure? - Yes, thanks. Let's get them. Alright. Did you recognise any of them? I assure you, Mrs Löwenstein, the three... What was their name? - Von Altenstatt. All these foreign names... - The von Altenstatts will be expelled from school. - A German family. Don't know. Why is that important, mum? Yes, they're German. Friedrich, can you hear? I looked for you at the pizza place. Why, it wasn't Wednesday. Something happened to me. I can't right now, I call you back. Well? Found something important? You'd better look after your sick mother. You think I'm a fool? Why didn't you ever say anything? What's your name? What's our real name? Changing your name when moving to a new country is normal. Who's this? It's you, right? It's evident. You should be proud of me. Proud? - Yes, proud. Instead of sneaking around like a rat. Proud of what? The people you killed? Out! Leave! What's the matter with you? I called, even looked for you. I've been meaning to tell you. I don't live at home anymore. Come, let's talk in peace. Hello, Federico. - How are you? Slow down! Why are you running? Look, we mended the roof. Come on. Mate? Bitter? What are you doing here? - Helping. It was all inundated. And that? - Nothing. You know... my father... I don't know... I'd like to go... to Germany. What? I got a scholarship to study politics in Frankfurt. Please understand! I've got to know, who my father was, what he did. And my own position in this. What are you talking about? Frankfurt? And us? What about us? Nothing, it's got nothing to do with us. Don't be sad. Congratulations. Your school leaving diploma. You are staying... - I love you. May I help? - Yes, thanks. More mail from Germany? I don't know where this will end. She's getting so rebellious. Had to wait up on her again last night. Don't worry, Ida. It's the age. It'll pass. Dinner at the "Globo", Saturday, as usual? Yes, sure. My God, Sulamit! Get up, at last! You can't be out till 5, and then sleep through the day. Who're you going out with? Why don't you tell me anything? You wouldn't want to know. Are you sleeping with these men? No, we play Dominos. If your father knew! - Leave me alone with my father. And these are going in the rubbish. No! You don't understand anything! I'm not staying, anyway. You know what I want? Write and study literature. And I'm going to Germany. What? At least they can pronounce my name there. Germany? - I got a scholarship. All expenses paid. Why didn't you say? - Would you've let me? Most certainly not. These Germans, are really paying for the trip and everything? They're not "these Germans". It's the DAAD, German Academic Exchange Service. You didn't give a thought to me. You don't need me, you found a replacement for dad, too. Right. He knows you're coming? Yes. Take this, you'll need it. For the return flight, should you get homesick. Thanks. I hardly recognised you. You're ever more beautiful. Is your mother hiding inside? Wait just a second. - Aren't we getting in? I can't go along with you, now. You take the bus. There's this political meeting I mustn't miss. Take her to Westend, she's not from here. Hurry up! - Coming. I'm with you as soon as we finish. Promise. We're late. - I know, hurry! What's that ring? I got married. Just teasing... Aunt Else gave it to me. It belonged to my great aunt Sulamit. I hardly attend my lectures. I find Critical Theory disappointing. I'm in an organisation that supports Cuba, and the freedom movements in Latin America. Stop, Friedrich. Look at me. Our president is such an idiot, receives Che Guevara, breaks off relations with Cuba under military pressure, and then gets chased out by the military. Sure we'll find a pizza place here? - Yes, we're almost there. I didn't even ask you how you were. Oh, so you thought of that? Right, I'm fine. My mind is somewhere else. But I'm happy to see you, honest! I'd love to be like you, so... Like... what...? So sure of what to believe in, so intransigent. I just learned how to fit in. Like all good Jews. What do you mean? My parents taught me, what possibly all Jews teach their children: To survive anywhere, anytime, to adapt. Thinking of my parents, or rather of my father, I no longer know what to believe. So many lies. Heard from them? No, I'm not in touch, and it doesn't matter to me. Why did you never tell? Why did you never invite me home? You never asked. - Yes I did. At the pizza place. Slept with other women? Of course, and you? With other women, no. What's happening with you now? Don't know. You're different, something special. Good morning, Sulamit. Señor Friedrich has woken up. It's open! Hi, how are you? I understood almost half of what was said. You're not stupid. This is Rodrigo from Santiago de Chile. You must try them. - Thanks. They're Chilean ones! José from Buenos Aires. Antonio from Lima. They all study politics. And that's Sulamit. My soul mate. We've known each other for ages. How will I learn German with all these Latin Americans? German's easy, even kids here speak it. I'll show you my room. Want another one? No thanks. Rodrigo, stop flirting. Eat up, we must be off. - Right. You really love to eat! Your sister. Yes... Margarethe is dead. Drowned herself in the Tigre. Why didn't you write? - I just couldn't. The lies, all the taboos, the horror of our family. It's my father's fault. Your house in the Tigre! No, it's the house of SS commander Rudolf von Weissburg-Neisse. Father's name in the 3rd Reich. In Argentina he called himself Rudolf Burg. I never realised. Once I found out, I wanted to get to Germany. Look, you met these people. Later it dawned on me. That's Arnoldo Schmidt. He smuggled the Nazi élite into Argentina, including Eichmann. Here's Werner Kühnheim, Horst's father, my childhood friend. It was up to him to transfer the money of the grand Third Reich to Argentina, money stolen from the Jews. Here's an SS tattoo, under the armpits. Can you see? No, can't see anything. Take the magnifying glasses. It made sure injured SS men got preferential treatment in hospital. See? - Il can't see any tattoo. You're just tormenting yourself. I'm this man's son. And I'm my parents' daughter. But I'm still myself. Wait! Please, let's not part this way! Why did you come to Germany? Germany of all places? I got a scholarship. Perhaps I'm looking for my parents' language? It's nothing to do with me? Nothing. That's why I love you so. - How do you mean? Why do you love me? Because you're Jewish. The Naive Type is not just found with Kleist. But the figure is characteristic for his work, and a prototype for the heroes of 19th century German drama. Let me read a particularly good excerpt. We are the small radical minority! Ho Ho Ho Chi Minh! The revolution is happening in Latin America. In Cuba, New Man is rising from the revolution. If we really want to do something, we should support the guerrilla in the Latin American countries. Put an end to perpetual colonialism. The best way to do something for others is to clear up things here. Set priorities, prevent the passing of the Emergency Laws, and remove reactionary forces from government, newspapers, and academia. Destroy the State Power to the Proletariat Not going in? - No. It's always the same. I wanted to attend literary class. I have a written exam. Why not go to my place... I could help with revision. It's what they all say. - In my case it's true. Not today, perhaps tomorrow. Perhaps tomorrow. After you. - Bye. It's crucial to get involved in the re-organisation of the universities so as to pre-empt any official plans. Get organised so strongly that education authorities, political parties, and government can't bypass us. That's our potential, it's where we should start. Let's begin, and establish facts. Let's see how the state deals with that. Comrade Cohn-Bendit will now speak... It no longer matters to me. You do what you want. I'll go fight, in Argentina. Friedrich, can we talk? Sure. In other countries where ten to twelve thousand students... What is it? - Nothing. Federico's affairs... Don't be annoyed. I meant to tell you, honest. I'm sick of myself, and of waiting for you. It's not the time for personal problems. When would it be? You want to leave? Go then, go! Calm down, let me explain. I can't stay. There's nothing I can do here. The place hasn't changed. Your aunt's murderers in Auschwitz are in government now. Leave my aunt out of it! I want to talk about us! Me too, but I can't just now! And you're wrong! Young people here challenge their parents and injustice. They'll stop rebelling once they're in secure jobs. I want to change things. But I'm Latin American, not German! You're German, and you needn't blame yourself. I have to fight, where I'm from. There's nothing I can do here. What are you doing? - Like what? It's Borges! Our Borges! - It's no longer my Borges, He publicly shook President Onganía's hand. He's a reactionary pig! Why not just burn them? Wait. Please excuse me. I haven't got time for trivialities, don't you see? My comrades collected the money for my fare back. I'll travel, no matter what you think. You're so beautiful. And you're a flatterer. Do you like my feet? And my back? My mouth? I sometimes feel like a stranger here. I also feel like a stranger. I'm from famous Cologne. Really? - Yes! I was born and brought up in England. My parents returned after the War, and bought a flat in Cologne. I'll show you the photos tomorrow. We could... Please don't be cross. I have to go. I need to be by myself. Because of Friedrich? - No. For my own sake. I love you, but I must go. Don't forget me. F. Hello? Is that the Burgs' house? May I talk to Friedrich? Who's that? María? Is Friedrich home? Ah. Don't even mention the name... Fucking hell, Chicho won! - Chicho? Allende won the elections! I'm going back to Chile! I'm so glad! All the best for you and your country! Do you want it? A souvenir from your Chilean friend? And our time in Frankfurt? I'd love to have it. Thanks. Have you heard anything from Friedrich? No. Honestly, I have no idea. Only José got in touch. He went to Argentina, too. Dr Horst Kühnheim? Horst? It's Sulamit Löwenstein speaking. Remember me? We met in the Tigre Delta. I'm calling from Germany. Of course I speak German. I call, because I heard nothing from Friedrich. Aren't you a lawyer? Can you still hear me? Resistance is now punished by death. Videla said, there'll be as many dead as it takes. We can't do it. Not with arms. Same empty words as in Germany! But there was a coup! It's war. Get it? It's not the same war. They'd kill us all! Enough. End of discussion. It will take place. Who's not joining? Right, time to pack up. You are...? "Polaco". Not you! And you? - "Corto". You're nearly 1,80m, why "Shorty"? For "Corto Maltese". You know what to do. Our goal is the weapons. Just the weapons. Our ally inside gives the light signal, and we start. It's got to be short and precise. Got it? Let's go. Wait! What is happening there? It's them! Come on! Stop! Paco! Quick, behind the back! Serves you right, leftist dog! - Move, get them in the car! Motherfuckers! I'll get you! In you get. Shut the door! Let's go! It's time to pack up. I got the job in Cologne. Great, at long last! It's just for a year, but still... Congratulations. Did you speak with your parents? - Yes, they're happy. They're going back to England, so we'd have the flat. Are you coming? Immediately? - More or less. May I have a coffee first? Your text is good. - Thanks. I still make mistakes. Don't worry. Don't know how to go on? It's getting worse and worse. Raids, kidnappings. Yes, I know. When will you unpack your boxes? Flaco just got in from Argentina. He'll tell us about the situation there. No need to translate? Tell us Flaco, please. I'll try to be brief. They're making people 'disappear' in clandestine prisons. They torture to obtain names. Often they kill them. Corpses with hands and feet bound were found in the river. Only the mothers of Plaza de Mayo still have the courage to fight. Some of the kidnapped are German. Got any names? - Not yet. You should protest with the German Foreign Office. Insist, that they take up the cause of the missing Germans. Let's formulate a petition. We'll go the Foreign Office in Bonn tomorrow. Who's coming along? What's the use? We tried so often. How can you say that? We should at least try. I didn't say we shouldn't do anything. We're going tomorrow. - Right. Leave it. Would you prefer me to move out? No. Please understand. Here I'm concerned with belletristics, while in my country Friedrich and many others are being tortured or killed. I'm going to Buenos Aires. Don't be sad, I'll be in touch. You look so beautiful! Love suits you. My little Sulamit! Take some more. You're so thin. Eduardo, here's your typical Yiddishe Mamme. Don't I know. I'll go read a bit, leave you to talk in peace. You're doing fine with him. - Yes. I'm so glad not to be alone anymore. And you, darling? Are you happy with Michael? I like it in Cologne. And Michael is very protective. He gives me security, and helps with my work. We believe, Friedrich was abducted. I'm going to look for him. You know it's dangerous. You've no idea what it's like here. Never mind. Forget what I said. Mum, please. I'll go for a walk, see where we used to live. Take care of yourself. Yes? How can I help? María, it's me, Sulamit. Remember? Miss Sulamit! It's been so long! Are the master or the mistress at home? The Señora died a while ago, unfortunately. And the Señor is travelling. May I go to the attic? Do come in. No, I've got the key for the back door. The Señor had it bricked up. You've got to come through the living room. Come along. I don't manage the steps. Excuse me. These are the German Plaza de Mayo mothers. Here's Sulamit from Cologne, whom we'd been discussing. Sit down, some Mate? - Yes, fine. Well, Sulamit, the good news is, it's official, Friedrich Burg is back among the living. Him and two other 'missing' persons are now held as political prisoners at Rawson. It's a 20-hour bus drive to Patagonia. Perhaps your petitions helped. But the German authorities do nothing for their abducted citizens. They watch their economic interests, and sell arms here. We believe someone, maybe his father, paid money for his re-appearance. The problem is, only close relatives may visit. But he's alive, Sulamit. Take this. How d'you get it? I'm nothing like her. She was blond... We're prepared. I'll take an artistic photo of you. Second floor, right, Number 14. The stairs? - Over there. Thanks. Hold on! I've got something for you. - Right, great. You're visiting someone in prison? Yes, how d'you know? Why else should a young lady like you come to this place, at the end of the world? Margarita Burg... Residence? - Germany. Birth? - 14 June 1941, Berlin. How are you related to the prisoner? He's my brother. Only parents and spouses may visit. I was told, I could see him. It was a long trip. Please. Your bag. Put it here, open it. "Around the Day in 80 Worlds", Cortázar. Forbidden. "The Return Of Corto Maltese". Forbidden. "Mohn und...". What language is it in? - German. Paul Celan. Forbidden. Are all books forbidden? Can't he have any? Bring books which aren't forbidden. How do you know which ones? Get undressed, up against the wall. What? - Are you deaf? Don't look at me. Up against the wall. Everything, I said. Spread your legs. Open your arse. - What? I said, your arse. Spread your arse. Anything else to say? One book. You have a visitor, your sister. What? - Don't you want to see her? Burg, Federico, Señor. - Louder! Burg, Federico, Señor. - Louder! Sit there. How d'you get here? How did you get here? By bus. You shouldn't have. Don't tell me what to do. We've grown up. How are you? Better than you. I can imagine. Sorry, I'm trying to make you laugh, and I talk rubbish. I'm fine. I brought you some things, they said they'd let you have. A sweater... You got kids? No, I'm not made for that. And Germany? It's still where it was. Or do you mean something else? Yes, I'm with a man. It's dangerous. You should leave. Louder, I can't hear! Are you going to court? We're not in the 1st World. Leave! Tomorrow morning. I'm aware of the situation. Don't worry. It won't stay the same. There's outside pressure. You're not by yourself. I know, we're many. When I get out, I'll go to the Mapuche, fight for their land. It's the only worthwhile thing. Fight with them. Can't you, for once...? Don't worry, I'm flying back tomorrow. Thanks for coming. Is your mother alright? Yes, she sends her regards. Is she still with her boyfriend? - Yes, sure. Thanks. I have news. The philosophical faculty, Romance studies department are looking for an assistant, male or female. How did you get my signature? The interview is in two days. Thank you, Michael. You should always know, you're at home here. He's in prison. He's alive. You saw him? Yes. Well? I'm sorry. I love you too. But differently. Maybe we should get separated? With a changing key you unlock the house where the snow of what's silenced drifts. Whatever the blood that bursts from your eye or mouth or ear, your key changes. Your key changing changes the word that may drift with the flakes. Just like the wind that repels you, round your word is the snow. One day follows the other. At the end of poetry a new poetry begins. It's the translation for: Well? Do you notice anything? It sounds awful in German. Why is the sentence turned round? It could have been translated as 'at the end of poetry begins a new poetry'. Right. Democracy restored. Alfonsín voted in. Come celebrate. Your mum called, the country's jubilant. About time. Good news at last. I get you a glass. At last. An end to madness. Thanks. Good morning, Frau Löwenstein. - Good morning. May I attend as a guest today? Of course. Hello. I'm Federico. I'd like to help win back your territories. We're planting potatoes. Dear, dear Sulamit. I'm out. Yet I'm still incarcerated. When you came to Rawson I'd killed all my emotions. It was the only way to survive. Think of one or two things at a time, no more. If you'd admitted emotions you would die. Dear Sulamit. I still wait for you. I can offer you a home now, and all my love. I work with youngsters, teaching them what I know. But I learn more from them. It's autumn in Patagonia. The trees are changing colour. I miss you. When will you come? I wish we'd be back together. Let me hug you, Friedrich. Isn't my mother in? - She'll be back soon. She's gone to the shops. I'm coming to Argentina. I'll see you, but I'm going South first. You're seeing your German friend? He's not German, he's Argentinian. Your mother calls him that. She always says, you'll end up marrying your German friend. We're expecting you! Kisses. - Likewise. You'd like to pay? We'll be in Ñirihuau soon, where you get off. Of course. Thanks. For the dust, put it on your mouth! And where are we going? Home. Hi Pat! There you are! That's Sulamit? - Yes. How are you? Take the things inside, please! - I'm Ceferino. This home is waiting for Sulamit. Mate? Bitter? Does it still hurt? No, not that. Is the boy your son? Juan? No. He's Horst's, my childhood friend, remember? Of course I do. I asked him for help, on the phone, he rang off when he heard your name. Horst became a fascist. The son couldn't stand it, and came to live me. History repeats itself. And Ceferino? You want to know it all, don't you? No, he's the Lonko's son, the Mapuche village chief. I have a workshop here, where I show them how to recycle metal... Are we going to talk about Juan and Ceferino, or about us? About time. What? - You wishing to talk about us. What I really want to do now, is certainly not talk. Why only now? Why? Perhaps time while passing caresses us, relieves us. Has your war with our poet ended? I think I finished all my wars. I went to your parents' house. Well? - María opened the door. Did you see my father? He wasn't in. The key is no use anymore. The door no longer exists. We're going up there. It's the home to the Condors. Are you coming with me? Are you staying here?
