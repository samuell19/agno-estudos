Alia! Alia! Alia! Next, please. Come on, Maddy, come on, Maddy, come on. Come on. Come on, come on, come on, Maddy. Well, I'll put it into the computer system. Would you be able to highlight it please as a um, simple say... Hey. Information there on that line. Um, all you need to do is... - Come on, come one. - Thank you, have a good day. Next, please. It's uh, it's really straightforward. Then what we'll do is I'll put that into the computer. And you can Is there anything else I can help you with? No, that's it. Next, please. Hello. Let me check. So... No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Next, please! - And yeah, there you go. - I appreciate it, thank you. Next, please! - You're next. - Oh no, you go. You sure? Yeah, yeah, you know, I... I... needed to back... - Thanks. - Mmhmm, hmm. - Thank you for the help. - Thank you so much. I'll see you soon, thank you. I mean how about this? What are the chances, huh? Yeah, that wasn't forced at all. No, not at all. No, it wasn't. It was like fate, too thick. Come on, well, you look a little flattered. You always flatter me, Rex. Against my will, no less. Okay. Okay, I'll take that. Well, hey, picture this, though. Maybe the whole evenin' of it. That flattery, I mean, not... Unless it goes that way, which... What can I do for you? Everybody, down on the ground now! Everyone move where I can fuckin' see you. Go, go, go! He said, "On the fucking ground now!" Fuckin get down on the ground! Everyone, shut the fuck up! We gotta make this short and sweet. So listen up your names. Olivia Beatty. Robert Bell. Madeline Augustine. And Angela Reynolds. All of you up with your tills open. Ken King, I'm c... c- coming for you and your c... c... c... combination. Chop, chop motherfuckers. While he's doin' that, all of you hold up your wallets, fucking billfolds, money clips, take 'em out, and hold 'em above your head. I promise you'll be able to go about your business very soon. And thank you for your cooperation. Get the fuck out from under there. Hands where I can fuckin' see 'em. Now! Wallets up! Any resistance will be met with a broken fuckin' face! Please, please, I don't have any money, that's why I'm here. He says he ain't got anything! What did I just fuckin' say? And at that moment, Mr. Coen decided that it was his place to put the lives of everyone in that bank in further danger. And without hesitation, without any care or concern that's exactly what he did. Those poor souls. There's no denyin' the heroic nature of Mr. Coen's intentions and actions. No. No, no, no. No! Alright, everybody get up! Get out, I got this. He may have meant well... Stop, stop! Stop, stop... But this wasn't self-defense. Stop! Hold it right there. This was madness. The fact that he caused an unnecessary death proves he's a danger to society. Rex, this isn't gonna go your way, so the DA's offered a plea. I think you should consider it. What? No? Rex, if the jury wants to make a statement, you can get 20 years just for count 1. I was called a "hero" three times, were you not listening? Put that up against the innocent death they believe you caused. Okay, so what then? The DA's offered eight years. No parole, no probation, you serve the term in full. Do your time, you're free and clear. Keep walkin'! I am not gonna tell you again. I'm on a magazine? Here you go. Have a nice day. Did you find everything okay? Yeah. And uh, this, too. Fuck. Expired. Holy shit! What? Oh, heavens, great, it's Rex Coen. - Hey, Rex. Rex! - Hey, Rex. Hey, how does your first day of freedom feel, man? You can say somethin' about how you miss Boise? Looks like you gettin' some love and some hate. ♪ Nobody knows ♪ ♪ The trouble I've seen ♪ ♪ Nobody knows ♪ ♪ My sorrow ♪ Have you spoken with her since you've been back? ♪ Nobody knows ♪ Can you tell us how you two uh Did she come to visit you? ♪ The trouble I've seen ♪ Fuck off! Fuck out of here! They're such pricks. What are they doing? Rex, do you have PTSD? How much do you think they get for these, by the way, anyway, you know, like what? 100 a pop? 200? You gotta be at least worth 200, right? We never got the full story of the bank. You think you can give us some a little insight? Have you spoken with the girl, Maddy? Have you spoken with her since you've been back? Don't do it. Hey, no, no, no, no, no, hey. Don't do it. You still talk to her? Don't, don't do it. I saw that. Holy Mother of God. Whoa! Eight years, and back from the d... What's with your hair up here? You're gonna be on the news. Sorry. Dude, that is fuckin' nuts! Hey, if that were a movie, I still wouldn't believe it. I mean fucking Jason Bourne over here! Holy shit! Hey, listen to me. You gotta write a book, man. Did you tell anybody else? Haven't been to see anybody else. Oh, uh... Wait a minute. So nobody from the bank has told that story? Well, no. I mean nobody had your point of view. Mm, what about the girl? She came once. Once, wow! Huh, that's a bitch. I visited you more than that. Yeah, twice. Mmhmm. And no, you know what? She just... she found her life. That's all. Oh, you wanna go play a round? I ain't doin' nothin'. No, no, no, no. No, I'm not gonna play golf, Pete. How was Shawshank anyway? Hmm? Did you uh... Get, you know? Uh... Hey dude, listen to me, I don't judge... - Hmm. - Alright? You gotta do what you gotta do... Pete. - And it's a jungle in there. - Pete, Pete. If you ever wanna talk to somebody... Pete! Where's my shit? You know, people are really acting like you're a celebrity ever since your release re-sparked the old debate. Debate about what? About what you did, man. You know, some people think you're a hero and others, well... Think I'm a psycho twat? Fuckin' psycho twat. Probably the cringiest shit I've ever been called. I mean you're only getting that, because they don't know what went on inside the bank. I just told you. Nah, the media really buried that shit, man. All we saw was the trial and that censored YouTube clip, which was badass, by the way. Well, maybe I should write that fuckin' book. Yeah, I mean some versions of the story, you're like the... the Dark Knight, in others, you're the Joker. What do you think? Oh, I know. Yeah. Boom. So where to next? Finland. What? I kinda meant where to in Boise. Why Finland? Well, a very scientific, very calculated reason. What's that? I shot a spitball at a map. Wait, that is the stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard. Just ask Joe for your job back here you know, for a start. You're not thinkin' about going back to the military, though, right? You know, an all-new adventure in a foreign land. No baggage, nobody knowing who the fuck I am. It sounds like paradise. Help me! Help me, please! Help! Someone! Help me, please! No! Hey, it's you. It's you! It's you! It's me. Uh, that was a very great thing you did, sir. Very great. Very brave. Uh, you would have done the same. No, no, I wouldn't have. Takin' a vacation, Mr. Hero? Why you leaving, Mr. Wick? Mr. John Wick. You know, they were speaking about you. Mr. Wick, hey, hero. That couple, they were speaking about you. Oh, I'm sure they were. They said they want to get you. - Hero, hey, hero. - What? Wait, wait a minute, they wanna get me. What does that mean? I don't know. They said they were planning on getting you. Hey, hey, hey. Said you looked perfect for their son. Whatever that means. When you were in that bank, how did you know exactly what you were gonna do? That's funny. It's funny, it's a joke. Probably. Yeah. "Black humor", I think, you Americans would call it. Right. You know, lots have gone missing in Helsinki over the years. So what's in Finland? Lots. You got some bad guys to fight over there, too? You be careful. Hey, if you ever come to my home country, you and I... wait, hey. Freaked out? Okay. Yeah, well, hey, good luck to 'em, right? - You, too. - That's right. No one messes with Captain America! You could take 'em. You won't have to, but you could. They're just another couple of crazy fans. They don't wanna "get" you. What does that even mean? It was a pretty creepy smile, though. Oh my God! He definitely wants to get you! Chuck your dick away, quick. This is the pre-boarding announcement. Flight LS107 to Helsinki. We are now inviting those passengers with small children and any passenger requiring special assistance to board at this time. "Boi to hel." Uh, fuck me, right? Taxi. Hey. Hey, excuse me, what is that? Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, what the fuck are you doing? Hey! Hey! Hey, what the fuck! What the fuck are you doing? "Fee, Fye, Fo, Fum. I smell the blood of an American. Be he alive or be he dead. I'll grind his bones to make my bread." "'Nonsense, dear', said his wife. 'You're dreaming or perhaps you smell the scraps of that little boy you liked so much for yesterday's banquet.'" Banquet? Banquet. Good. "So off the ogre went, and Jack was just going to jump out of the oven, and run away when the woman pulled him." "At last, his head began to nod and he began to snore until the whole house shook again. "The princess ran downstairs to meet her charming prince." Okay, okay. So Don't let them hear you. How? I don't know. It's impossible. Obviously not. No. No, no, it's not possible. Obviously. Obviously not and don't let them fuckin' hear you! Them? Them? Who's them? No. Not not them. No. The airport? The creepy couple? Is that what this is? Or the most fucked up coincidence in history. And keep your voice down. How? How? They got you. How? How? How? How come? I have no fucking idea! I have no idea! Let me ask you something. Why'd you pick Finland, huh? Of all the fuckin' places on the planet why Finland? Why did you choose fucking Finland? Fuck! Fuck! How? Okay, you know what? If you're gonna insist on asking that question, I suggest you apply it to figuring out how to undo those knots and get the fuck out of here, because guess what, pal? Hey, you're here and it doesn't matter how. It doesn't matter why. You are here! Welcome to paradise. Okay, okay. What do we know and what do we need to know? My leg's missing. It's quiet and it's dark. It's gotta be about the middle of the night, I guess. I don't know. We need to know how much time we have. If you can't undo those knots by dawn, it's gonna be big trouble in little Finland. Now, we know this ain't even close to their first rodeo. What we need to know is there anything useful in those bags? Now, that looks like polyester staple rope tied up in triple knots. If you can't tie knots, tie lots. Yeah, we know they have confidence in that rope, because your mouth ain't gagged and your leg's swinging free. Either that or they know it'll take more time than you have. Or I'm not supposed to be awake. Five years ago, Dr. Orso, I woke up durin' the root canal. Let's play it safe and say it's about 4:00 in the morning. I hope it's 1:00. Well, heck, I hope it's fuckin' ABC fuckin' Prime Time up in this bitch, but let's play it safe and say it's 4:00. so you bein' awake gives us a considerable advantage. I'm a cripple. Yeah, let's talk about that. Why aren't you dead? You should be. They prevented you from bleeding out. Why? And why your leg, huh? They can't possibly be medical professionals, judging by the look of this pathetic hack job, but I don't know. Black market human limb trade, is that a thing? I'm pretty sure in Serbia... Can we go back to me not dying, please? Right. Right, right, right, yeah, okay. So a dead Rex would be a useless Rex. Apparently. So they're keeping you alive to keep your parts from rotting! I don't know. I mean I guess that makes sense for the uh, organ trade deal, but you've still got your kidneys, your lungs, your heart. What good is just one leg? It's a fuckin' family. - Let's get out of here. - Yeah. You think you can gnaw that shit off? Come on, teeth. Hey, I'm lighter Okay. You see? Hey, hey! Not the time. Alright. Good night. It's fiber. Come on, come on! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is it? What? Answers. Here it comes. That's 2:00 a.m. Hoo-hoo! Let's go hard, can you show me what you got? Let's go. Fuck! Fuck is that? Oh, fuck! Okay, maybe... We need a backup plan. How did that dude get away from the crazy bitch in that movie Misery? Uh, he uh... He used the story he was writing as his insurance policy. Wow. As long as he had it, she couldn't kill him. She needed it. He used it as leverage, and then he destroyed it, and bashed her head in with a typewriter. Yeah, we need an insurance policy. And a typewriter. Man. Asleep! Asleep! You're asleep! Is this it? Oh, shit! Is this it? I have nothing! Fuck! Fuck it! Fuck it all! I have nothing! Oh, this is no good at all! I have nothing! Is it them? They're just looking. It's okay, I think they're only looking. It's okay, it's okay. It's a boy. That's just a little boy. As if this shit couldn't get me creepier! Well, here's the good news. Here's our insurance policy. Hey, you know, what would be funny is if you tore this little asshole's leg off, and then stuck it to yourself, and then walked upstairs as if nothing was wrong. Banquet. What the fuck? Stop him! Wait, wait, wait, wait, um... Stop! Spanish, really? I don't know. Whatever. Reel him in. Slowly. Hey, hey. Kid. Come here. Yeah, yeah, come here, come here. God, I wish I knew some Finnish. Come, you come. You. You think he speaks English? Do you speak English? You do? I'm not gonna hurt you. Oh, but he is so gonna hurt you. Huh, look at that, you got him. It's okay, don't be scared. I just wanna know your name. And to use you as delicious bait. Olavi. What's your name? Ola... Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy fucking shit, man! Whoo! Olavi? Now, what do we do? Hold tight. Olavi. His name's Olavi? I thought he was saying "hola". He reacted when I spoke to him in Spanish. Quiet. Please. I know that feeling, trust me. Do you speak English? I'm not gonna hurt you or him. Again. Do you speak English? Do you speak English? You do, you do. Great, okay. He's not dead. I can feel his pulse. I might have broken his nose, though. I'm sorry about that. I felt like I had to. My name is Rex. Pleasure is all mine. I'd offer you my hand, but well, you'd probably keep it. I'm kidding, that's a joke. Um, well, not really. Kinda. What's your name? Uh, no. No, no, no. Hey, hey, here we go. Back up here. Hey, before you do anything rash, know that all I have to do is squeeze. So you and I are gonna make a little deal with each other, okay? If you let me go, I'll let him go. Alright? In fact, I'm gonna make it even easier for you. All you gotta do is give me that knife right there and I'll release him. That's all. It's all you have to do. What do you say? Damn! What a sexy little psychopath, huh? What's she doin'? She gonna help you or kill you? Help you or kill you? Hey, is she gonna help you or kill you? I don't know! You don't know what? Oh, fuck. Fuck. Fuck! So do we have a deal? Knife, knife. Get the knife! Hey, no, come on. You don't wanna do this. You don't wanna to do this. Look at me, look at me! You're not like them. Are you? Are you? Well done, fuckhead! We have to get out of here now! Ollie. Ollie! Did they all just leave? Oh. That Finnish chick, though. What? What? She was sexy. You saw her. She's a murderer. Yeah, I'm not convinced, though. She was covering her eyes. Why would she be covering her eyes? Now is not the time to play... Psychotherapist to the fuckin' Manson Family. I'm not saying we do that. I'm just saying I'm not convinced that she was a murderer. That's all. Well, you've been wrong before, so What? When? Oh, I don't know. Uh, "They're just fans. They don't wanna get you. What does that even mean?" Huh? That's you! Oh, give me a break. You... Yes, I did! Okay. Yes, I did. Well, yeah, okay of course, if the opportunity arises, we will do that. That's not what I'm arguin' and fuck this! How'd they take it? Not too well, I'm guessing. Where'd they take him? The hospital, yeah? Did they all leave? What'd you tell 'em? Hey, why am I still alive? Unless you're here... wait, wait, what is that? What is that? A butcher Barbie play set? Another joke. What? What are you gonna do? Just remember to breathe. Breathe. I can breathe. Breathe. Definitely breathing. It's for the circulation. It's working. I'm Alia. I like you. I have no idea what to do with that. What would you do with this? With that? Um, off the top of my head, I would uh... I would free myself and kill your family you know, pretty standard stuff. What? You can't. Well, I could, but uh, I'm guessing you wouldn't like that very much. My family, they're insane. No! Well, I wouldn't say that. No. But you can't kill them. Hey, listen, no offense, but fuck that, they're dead. No, I mean really you can't. Like you won't be able. Then we'll leave. They will find us. You don't know that. How do you know that? 'Cause they always do. And when they do, we will pay. This is all because of him, because of Pati. Who the fuck is Pati? Oh, he's my brother. The oldest and hungriest. He's the reason you're here and very soon there will be nothing left of you. Is she sayin' Are you saying that you're... that I'm Lunch? And dinner. He was born a monster with a taste for only one thing. They tried alternatives and for a while it seemed to work. But when he had a craving, there was never any other option. The hunger was insatiable. So finally, they gave in to the one solution they'd been avoiding. Mmm, this is awesome. Thank you so much. You're very welcome. I was literally starving. You're a real lifesaver. He never grew up, never grew out of it. Night after night, I saw more and more death. More and more blood. For years, I tried, but they always found me. So when Ollie was born, I had no choice but to try and save him from these horrors. But it was pointless. Phew! And they found a way, as they always did, to make sure that I would never ever leave again. And for years, I haven't. All I've ever wanted was for someone to come save me from this horrible place. Hello? Lady, I am right here! Your crazy-ass family... please, don't walk away. Your crazy-ass family is gone, okay? I've got a head start on him. Hmm, alright? So just toss me the knife and we can get the fuck out of here. You and me both of us, we'll blow this joint. Come on, you and me. Come on, come on. This won't change anything, as much as I wish it would. I know I'm just committing suicide, but Your English is really good, by the way. Insatiable? It's... well, it's insatiable, but it's good. It's really good. Thanks. Yeah. I wasn't meant for this life. They knew it. But never did they care. I've seen so many die. Well, I kinda figured that, so No, no, I never wanted to. They forced me to feed him. But I never in my heart felt like they do. I have dreams to heal, not destroy. I want to be a doctor. Yeah, well, I'm sure you get a lot of practice in this fuckin' place. I wish Pati was never born. I never wanted to be part of it. That's why they hate me so much. I've fed people to my Well, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, I talk to myself you know, so we all have issues, you know? Why? Um, why what? Why do you talk to yourself? It was something I picked up while I was in prison. Bitch, I've been with you for longer than that. You were in prison? I was, yeah. Hello? Afghanistan? OEFA? Why? It's a long story. Tell me. I'd love to, I really would. I'd love nothing more, but now really isn't the time. Oh, and I'm sure you forget about the bank already then, huh? Hey, but I'll tell you what. If we get out of here, I'll tell you the whole story over dinner. What do you say, huh? I'll even pay, huh? You're not vegan though, are you? 'Cause that'd be a turn off. What's a vegan? Uh, a vegan is like a person, but a... I'm assuming you shouldn't be here. What? Son of a mother... Hang in there whatever happens. You. I can't wait to end your miserable life, you fucking psycho twat! I have to go now. How will you get by 'em? I'll find a way. Bloody hell. Kill them all. What the fuck? He fuckin' shoot himself? Right there. He's right there, you fuckin' idiot! Dude, have you seen this shit? What is it? It's a bank getting robbed. A fuckin' robbery. Some dude goes apeshit on the robbers. This is fuckin' sick. He took his fuckin' gun. Wow! Oh shit, dude, watch, watch, watch, watch. Hands are up, alright? Holy shit. Oh, he's gonna to shoot him, he's gonna shoot him. - Let's not watch that... - Would you stop? Well, you should watch, it's comin', it's comin'. - Oh, what the fuck! - Oh! Oh, come on! They always censor the good shit. He's right there, you fuckin' idiot! Hands are up, alright? Okay? Just take it easy. Hit, hit, hit. Wait. Wait, wait, wait! This guy is badass. What the fuck are you doing? No, no. No! Fuck. Alright, everybody, get up and get out, I got this. Oh, hang tight back there. I'll only be a moment. Come on, let's go! Now, Rex does somethin' I personally wouldn't recommend. And that's turning his back on the remaining threat. You'll see in a second why he does, but with the backroom still full of employees and an active shooter, he's takin' a big risk by leaving them behind. What he does instead is approach one of the downed gunmen. What he says, we can't hear. Was it worth it? Hmm? You move again, I'll run my foot down your fuckin' throat, okay? Suck my balls. No, that's disgusting. Yippee ki... No, it's been done. I still... fuck. Time to die, hell boy. Boom! Shotgun number 3. There's no denyin' the heroic nature of Mr. Coen's intentions and actions. But his reckless approach and chaotic manner, which he felt was absolutely necessary to meet his personal fantasies, cost an innocent mother her life. He may have meant well, but his rash decisions left Angela Reynolds dead. Hold it right there, Charlie. I'll blow her head off. Gun down or she dies. Okay. Then you die, you know that, right? You want this girl to die? Honestly, I don't give a fuck, I do wanna shoot you, though, real bad. Shoot him in the dick. I'm gonna count to 3, and only 3... And then you die You know, I get it. I get it. Shoot him in the dick. This wasn't self-defense. This was madness. 1, 2, 3... Fuck, man, stop. What are you doing? Fucking just... I don't wanna die today. You don't wanna die today. She doesn't wanna die today. So drop our weapons, and I'll book her to the back door, and be out of your hair. No fuss, no muss. All cool? Would you agree, Mr. Coen, that it was your actions that led to the death of Ms. Reynolds? No, because they murdered the guard upon entry. They weren't hesitant to start the shooting and they wanted us all to see blood at their hands. There were multiple incidences of violence from them. Unprovoked. They were the ones having fun with the violence, I just acted before it became something bigger. All cool? Maddy. See, in my mind I want you to very carefully, very slowly and with my military training stand up. we were all witness to a murder Huh, she's not goin' anywhere. I thought you didn't wanna die today. And personally I don't feel that they were gonna let any of us go. So no. Get up, come over here. Get behind me. I'd say it was their actions that led to Ms. Reynolds' death. Don't you fuckin' move, fuck. Not mine. Don't you fuckin' move, don't fuckin'... It's okay. Don't listen to him. Mr. Coen had won. It was over. No one else had to be harmed. But that wasn't good enough, was it, Mr. Coen? We're cool, yeah? Alright. Shoot him in the dick! Fuck. Why? Why wasn't it good enough? Why the need to immobilize the perpetrator in such a barbaric, inhumane way? Well, I wanted him down and I didn't want him to reproduce. It's a win, win. I felt like you meant it. I didn't. But I felt like you did. Well, I didn't. Maddy, Maddy, hey, hey. I did exactly what I knew I had to do and it worked. Hmm? Rex, thank you for what you did. I know it doesn't seem like it, but I'm truly, truly grateful. My family is, too. You did save my life. I just... Uh, I don't know how to say this, 'cause it's awful. Just say it. Deal with the emotion later. I don't wanna see you. I mean, I... I don't want a life that includes coming to prison to visit the man who saved my life out of guilt for half a decade. I know how bad that sounds, but that would be the only reason. I'm sorry. What is that? Finland? Can't run away from your problems, my friend. They always find a way to catch up with you. Especially heart break. Can't outrun heart break. Rookie mistake. Yeah, what would you know about it? More than you think, but you do you, amigo. You do you. Just tryin' to extend a helpin' hand. How is that possible? Yeah, I suppose you uh, don't believe in fate, do you? That remains to be seen. Come here. Okay, okay, okay. Rex, now or never. Let's do it. Kill 'em all, get her out of here. She's not my concern. What are you talkin' about? She practically begged you to murder her family and take her away from here. Again, she is not my concern. My concern is getting back to the life I had. Getting the fuck out of this place and getting back to my friends in the good old US of A where we don't fucking eat people. Capisce? So what are we doing then, hmm? We're leaving. This is in case anybody's waiting for us up there. You're not leaving without her. I'm not going out of my way to save some girl. No girl. Not this time. How much time do we have? Not enough. Ay, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai. She's scared. She isn't like them. She isn't Maddy, it's not the same. Maddy never wanted you. Maddy never needed you. This girl though, she... She does need you, Rex. She's been needing you her whole life. Don't turn your back on her. And if I didn't know any better I'd say you need her as much as she needs you. Yeah, you forget, buddy. I live in your head. New man out. Oh! Hey. I guess you don't watch the news that much, huh? We just killed your entire family. How do you feel about that? I have mixed emotions. It's fair. It's emotions, by the way. What was that? Pati. Pati. That's your brother. Mm-mm. I thought you said he never grew up. I meant mentally. Would have been nice to know, Alia. Sorry. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Pati, Pati. Pati, Pati. Pati, Pati. Pati. Pati. She started it. Don't, don't. Pati, Pati. Pati. Pati. Pati! Pati! Do you want it? Do you want it? Eat it, Pati! You sick, twisted fuck. Any more giant siblings I should know about, Alia? No, no. We're safe now. That was a good last line. "Eat it, Pati!" That's from Misery, right? Yeah. Yeah, it was good, it was good. You know, what would have been better, though? It's if you said something along the lines of uh, "You're finished", you know? Or something like, "Finish your vegetables. Uh." You know what I mean? Because they're... You know, anything with finish in it really, because they are Finnish. So when we get there, what do you wanna do with you little brother? Kill him? No! We're taking him with us. Oh, okay. Okay. So how did you two meet? Uh, well, I was on vacation in Finland. And uh, and her parents hated me. Uh, like biblically hated me. Alright, anyway, it turns out, she had four brothers. You know, each was a little quirky So I killed her entire family and we've been a couple ever since. What?
