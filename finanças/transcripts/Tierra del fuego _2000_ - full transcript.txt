PUNTA ARENAS, 1899. LAST NIGHT OF THE CENTURY. . God bless Julius Popper, peacemaker of Patagonia. God bless Julius Popper. Such a man never existed. I climbed to the top of the mountain... and from there I saw Paradise. We're all equal! I declare the end of all hierarchy, and the equality of races in the Land Of Fire. Who are you, stranger? I bring a message from the landowners of Magellan. It is said that around 1850, gold was found in Magellan, Patagonia. At Punta Arenas schemers have arrived; Prostitutes, addicts, convicts. Spawn of famine and exile. LAND OF FIRE ♪ With the dawn came a Knight. Welcome to the land of Tierra del Fuego. The beginning, and the end of all roads. Welcome to the land called Tierra del Fuego. The road is deadly, like an arrow. Beyond the pass, God is behind you. ♪ It is June 24, (Voicing) The day of Saint John, I finally made it to Tierra del Fuego. I hope, my Lady, to fulfill the plans given me in dreams. I swear to honor your name with my actions and make me worthy of the honor you bestowed upon me. Sir, Sir! Have pity on this poor man. Sir, Sir! Thank you, Sir. Thank you! My name is Popper. Julius Popper. Thank you, Mr. Popper. Heaven bless you. Don't forget it. Julius Popper! Mr. Popper gave me gold. Mr. Popper gave me gold! Three down! The third man who will sleep the sleep of the righteous. Who's next? Is there not a real man left at the end of the world? Today is an exceptional day. We have the light of heaven and the light of hell. Day is night and night is day. Sir, please. Please look at these pictures. Go ahead, sir. And just as this gentleman does, you will all be able to see the horror of a land not even Hernando Magellan dared to walk. Cruel and gigantic Indians of the Land Of Fire, The Patagonians, they called it "Karukinka." - They're terrible and they're naked... - Don't listen to him. ...like evil beasts. Don't listen to him. Indians are peaceful. All they want is to live in peace with God and with nature. Get out of here, you crazy fuck. Are you hurt, Monsignor? Monsignor? You called me Monsignor? I am Romanian and Orthodox, I know the dignity of your habit. Blessed be God! Finally, a Byzantine like me. Bring it on! Who dares to compete against me? For a few silver coins, anyone brave who accepts the challenge and defeats me, takes a chunk of my money, and one bundle of chulengo skins. (Young wild Andean Llama) They are worth their weight in gold. Show the skins to these bastards. And what the hell are you drinking here, Hungarian? Basque! The best catch of brandy you can get in all Patagonia. Pure fire, Basque. Since your shipwreck, you only catch lice. Catch this, Basque! Come on! Drink up, Basque! Land of Biscay, who knows if I'll ever see it again? Basque loses. Show me the money, right now! What's packed on your horse? My instruments. I'm an engineer. And I am Nostradamus, stranger. Give me a drink. Who's that? Carmen Silva, Queen of Romania. Fine. You keep her! Your sarcasm is inspirational. I know something that might interest you. I'm listening. Damn! Across the Strait of Magellan is the Land Of Fire. No man's land. I know. I came to conquer it in the name of my queen. My name is Julius, Julius Popper. We'll see each other again, I assure you. You're not a good prophet, Julius Popper. We will all find ourselves in hell. "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate", ("Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.") Dante at the gates of hell. Men! I guess they're men, right? Fifteen days of travel from Argentina to come to you. Crossing rivers, forests, mountains, and glaciers. And here we are! the hottest women at the end of the world, to warm your winter. Come on! What happened? Come on, men! Have courage! Let's go! The serpent you want has green eyes, long hair, and full, sinful lips. Hey, you. Help me down. A queen like you should never touch the ground. Lord, why hast thou forsaken me? There's nothing left to drink. Sir, Sir! Where is Mennar? Where is our Queen? Where is Mennar? For the last time, do I pluck out that Arrow or not? First you take it out, and then get paid. That's the deal. The wound is blue, my friend. And I'm not happy with the animals roaming loose. Where were you when that arrow hit? It was close to China Creek. We didn't see the bastards. - You never see them. - Get the fucking arrow out! Love and pain are paid for first. - Fine. I'll pay first. -No. This is my say and is only paid if I live to tell about it. Damned meddler, you'll have to pay for it. I'll pay what's due. I like men who do the right thing at the right time. I always say, it's an old fashioned custom, Sir. No one here takes care of the debts of others. Julius Popper, engineer. At your service, Ma'am. Sita! Here it is not customary to pay to save someone else's skin. I always pay lady. For pain and for love. I wonder if you're an idiot, a fool, - or a showoff. -Or a gold mine. How many gold coins do you want? Five, ten, a hundred? How many can you get in one night without having to use your hands? Careful what you say, Stranger. Get this one out of here, let's go. I think I've seen you before. - I'm following you, sir. - May I ask why? Where did you find it? - You mean the gold? - What else? Serve my new friend a dose of the best whiskey. -And you are.? - Novak, Fritz Novak. I think you need men, Sir. It depends on what you can do. Kill. I was a sergeant in the Royal Guard in Vienna. Hey, dude. What's this? This coin is worthless here. It has more value than any government coins. If you have any questions friend, check it. The weight is pure gold. You can accept it. And if it is fake, you already know the fate of liars in this town. Well, if you say so. It's gold. It's gold! It's gold! Gold has arrived, you bastards. It's gold! Ladies and gentlemen! I raise my glass and toast the Queen of Romania, Her Majesty Carmen Silva, May God keep her alive for centuries and centuries. Amen. Who is she? Will you hit me again, Miss? You'll find out. I like you. I know, I like you too. And who is this queen? Invite me to your room and I'll tell you. If you dare to go to my room tonight, I'll wait for you there. But first, I want to know what kind of man you are. ♪ And Long Live Mr. Popper. Who brought gold coins. There's a shine in your eyes of fortune and treasure, and the Queen of Romania. What is the water of life? In your eyes are reflected the promised fortune ♪ It must hurt a lot. I know that pain. Do what you came to do and leave. (Speaking Ona) You're free. Who are you? Me? Julius, Julius Popper. You? Mennar. Sir, I took care of your instruments. Thanks a lot. Sir, you can relax. I'm here and no one will bother you. You know what, Novak? I see that soon you will become a general. Sir, a general needs soldiers. So what are you waiting for? Go find some! Invite all these good people to drink. Hey, you! Drinks for everyone. This is gold! Gold! Amazing! Return the key. Not now. This dalliance will cost you extra. Besides, why would you want to talk? You don't need me. But you have all that I'm looking for. Gold. Can you come here for a moment? What do you see in the distance? - The sea receding. - Take a good look! In a few hours, it will retreat much further. I want to show you something. Come with me. I dreamed of getting to this sea and finding gold. Picture me in China, on the banks of the Yangtze River, panning for gold, when they told me about this sea at the end of the world. Look how the skeleton of this ship pans gold. Imagine hundreds of boats scattered around this sea. As the tide comes in, they are filled with gold. And when the tide goes out, we'll catch it. Work with me and I will make you incredibly rich. So it's agreed. You handle the men's food. Easily done, Novak! It will not be difficult to feed this bunch of bastards. It does not require much effort. You are Hungarian, I am German. You and I represent discipline here in this shitty land, -..godforsaken.. - Bullshit, Novak. I left old Prussia because I wanted to live as a free man. You pay me and I obey, that's all. Come on, Come on! - Do you trust these Indians? - How European! Ask the French if they trust the Germans, the Portuguese, if they trust the Spanish. And you, Novak? Do you trust Popper? Every dog knows that the hand that feeds is the same hand that punishes. Come on, look here! Just a few words. I was until yesterday just a poor devil. Now, honored, wealthy. And with winter coming, lice won't keep you warm. Come on! Step up! - Who enlists first? -I will. - Me too. - And me, sir. You speak of honor and wealth. How much of one and how much of the other? For honor's sake, I'm staying in Wladfa. I doubt honor can get into the pot. It is tough and makes a very bad broth. To begin with, it is an honor serving Julius Popper, but I'm also talking about gold, a lot of gold. much more than you can get out of your bags. Mine has always been my flag. Show me something that will convince me. This coin, it's pure gold, and there are many like this waiting for you. Gold in exchange for what? As Salfi Al*said, "What can you do?" (*Proph.~helping do good, both get grace) I play the bagpipes. My father was a Piper, my grandfather was a Piper, what the fuck could I do? We'll see. Tell me your name. No matter why you came or why you're here. None of that is important here. My name Is Manuel Silveira and I care where I come from and why I'm here. My name is Cosimo Spiro and I get what you need to know. Sign us up already. If they give me the money that I need to build and install my machines for collecting gold, I promise to solve your problems with the Indians. Come on. Pants. Now! Quick, quick! Hit that pedal! My uniform should've been ready half an hour ago. I'll do what I can, sir. It's the first time I've ever made a uniform. The trouble with Tierra del Fuego, Sir, is that every self-respecting adventurer says they have found gold. We are herders. Our gold is white, our gold is sheep. I'll tell you two things, Sir. First of all, I'm not an adventurer. The second, I don't need your land. What I need are the shores of the sea, this sea full of gold. Come on, try on the uniform. Popper's gift. You, come here, man. Try on the uniform. Not you, drunk. Out! What will you do with the Indians? I will make them disciplined workers. What about you? What do you want for yourself? I don't need anything, sir. I fight for ideals. - This young man is crazier than goats. - Mr. Popper! We didn't come here to listen to nonsense, or things we've heard before. Put on your uniform, you bastard. The Hungarian, Schaeffer, doesn't wear a uniform, Basque. You are nothing but filthy shepherds! Miserable shepherds! No ambition! No future! No idea of progress! You've gone too far, engineer. You'd better go. These men are powerful. They influence governments from Chile and Argentina. You don't believe me either? No. Wait. Don't go. At least not tonight. Wait. How can I trust you? If you trust a queen, all the more reason to trust a prostitute. I hope that's enough, partner. Embrace your queen, Julius Popper. Good. Fall in! Desert Land Army, give a salute to our commander in chief, Julius Popper. Men of aimlessness, misfortune and shipwrecks, you have been separated from God's hands. But fate chose you all for the greatest of endeavors. Which is? To bring progress to the most remote lands. Today we will leave the continent, we will cross the Strait of Magellan and we'll go to Tierra del Fuego. Let's take the gold and sow the seed of progress and return as men worthy to serve our gracious Majesty, Carmen Silva, Queen of Romania. Tomorrow you will be new men. - Long live the Queen of Romania! - Hooray! - And long live Julius Popper! - Hooray! Get over here, quick. - I'm looking for my horse. - You won't find it. You freed my Indian and I freed your horse. Your horse, Sir. Having, my lady, (Voicing) crossed the famous Strait of Magellan, I hurried to set up camp, continuing to measure with my instruments the depth of the waters, the density and thickness of air and winds. And everything leads me to conclude that very soon we will find gold in abundance. ♪ Where will the sea cast all your yellow silt? That you picture bringing the gold from its depths that hides further down. Within the finest pebbles There are riches. Or is it just a trick? For the gold I command and pray Show it, Tierra del Fuego. For the gold I command and pray Show it, Tierra del Fuego. ♪ Damn pyrite! (Fool's gold) It's just pyrite! Nothing but pyrite! It's not all pyrite, mate. - Schaeffer! - In the flesh! - How long have you been here? - Forever. I have a pact with the sea or the ocean, you can choose what to call it. She leans back and I penetrate her. - Gold! - Almost, almost Gold! Tell me the truth, you fucking Hungarian. What's that noise? The sea returning. Run, Romanian! Run, Run, Run! Gold! Gold, All Gold! Gold! Hey, Indian! Idiot! Indian! Fucking Indian! Up! Indian! Fernandez, drag that shit! Charge! Get out of here! I think you overreacted, Novak. You have to show power, Sir. That's important. Two working arms less. Yes, but the authority is better. I have no doubt. Are you implying that I am weak? No, I follow orders. Wake up, wake up! You're crying like a child. Novak is right. You're just a bundle of weakness. No, Armenia. No. I'll show you who is Julius Popper. ♪ They are neither men nor women, those below. They don't think, they don't feel, nor suffer from pain. If they do not serve they are tossed aside. The invader torments the enslaved. For gold, he'll kill and subjugate. Mindlessly, for gold..♪ - Here are more laborers, Sir. - Why are there so few? Because they hide, Sir, but we'll find them. I hope so. Winter is coming and we have no food. We can't wait, Novak. What do you think, Mr. Novak? You still think I'm a weak man, Novak? Damned rain! It won't stop raining. I've lost count of days you can't fucking see the sun. Don't complain, Galician. Winter's not even here yet. When you face that cold in this fucking land of fire, you will curse the day you ended up here. Popper said nothing about spending the winter on this side of the Strait. We're not animals. We can't live in a stable. At least we're indoors. The Indian laborers don't even have that. Schaeffer, what are we here for? Looking for gold? Well, we've done it, now what? It's time to deliver. Easy there, Italian. Popper knows what he's doing. You get along very well with him. - What's your secret? - Secret? I am a poor Hungarian in this cold land at the end of the world. I don't think Popper knows where there's enough gold for all of us. Popper knows what he's doing. If Popper distributes the gold now, everyone will leave, abandoning him all alone. The Romanian is clever. I want my money and then I'm leaving, same as will everyone else, no doubt. Popper knows what he's doing. Popper. Popper. Who's Popper? Appeared out of nowhere handing out coins of gold in the name of his Romanian Queen. And took up with the only woman you liked. The last word hasn't been said yet in that game. I think he's a lunatic. In Punta Arenas some beggars shouted at him: "You are the Savior!" and he liked it. Worse for him. Why do you say that? All those who believe themselves to be a God end up being crucified. Where the hell are our men? Whoever did this, Mr. Novak, will pay dearly. They killed themselves, Sir. The Indians call it poison grass. Traitorous Indians! Savages! - But I get it. - Stupid! I understand it. Shut up for once or I'll send you to hell! Stupid German. Bring my horse! Chants: The air is purer, clearer than you. The dawn is more beautiful than you. The land is stronger than you. The mountain is higher, but you are the Queen. The only one. The Chosen One. Chosen One... Chosen One.. Mennar! Mennar! Mennar! Mennar! Mennar! I need your help. It's me Julius, Julius Popper. This wind and this cold, it's going to drive me crazy. What do you want? Mennar, why are your brothers killing themselves? They want to be free. Tell them I will give them riches. Gold! Lots of gold! You fool. You don't understand anything. Go away from this forest and return to your own land. Mennar, I beg you. Don't force me into war. Mennar! Mennar! Mennar! Mennar! Savior, give me strength! I need your will. Made on Earth as it is in heaven. Purge this off, Creator! Send it to the ice. Take it with the wind. Take it into the harsh darkness. Take it away. Take it away. I haven't eaten yet. I want a good cut of meat! No. Him. Let him serve me. Place it gently on my plate. You know how to treat meat delicately? It depends on the meat. Wow, brave Spiro got his voice back. Serve wine, and drink. The natural thirst that never goes away, just as the Samaritan asked for the lady's blessing. Bravo! Verse Twenty-one. Drink! I prefer the lashes of your contempt to Popper knowing that I drank from his glass. You are a coward, you disappoint me. Go away. I am a practical man. You must be patient, Ma'am. I picked up the Piper while he was trying to escape. That's thirty grams, Sir. Thirty grams of gold stolen from the Queen of Romania. Was it just the Piper? No, others helped him, and they ran, led by Father Alexis. So the Monsignor stole my gold too? Your gold? We served you like slaves for months, and what do we get in return? Nothing! Nor can we cross the Strait to see women, like all men. I said fortune requires great sacrifices! Oh, yeah. Our sacrifices, but not yours. - Silence, you insolent bastard! - I'm not in the mood! All the men wonder what the fuck do you do with the gold? Cheater! Swindler! Liar! No one believes the story of your fucking Romanian Queen. Novak! How did you drag up this insolent Galician? The Galician was a good soldier, Sir. And I thought with his bagpipes he would cheer men up. You enlisted the Priest, Sir. The bandits who escaped must be captured and the Monsignor hanged for betraying God and the Queen. As for you, Galician, I condemn you to stand where you are, playing your devil's instrument for thirty hours. One for every gram of gold stolen. Novak, if he moves or stops playing, kill him! Rebellion, like a plague (Voicing) springs up, transforming every man into a danger and livid with a grudge. What to do, my lady, with so much built up antagonism? Still, I feel that every pain every memory is mine to bear. Every feeling is born and dies in me. Oh, My Lady, My chest is aching and the pain blinds me. A year ago, we began the search for gold, and although at first it seemed abundant, over time, it decreased. I trust in God my Lady, my Sovereign. Only God knows the difficulties that I went through being so faithful to you. My poor Manuel. You are an orphan now. Stop! You have no reason to be here. He's his son with a right to be here. Bastards have no rights. Out! You bastard. You've never been my brother's real wife. You're a son of a bitch. Look who's talking. Manuel! Manuel! Manuel! Manuel, where have you been? Come home. Come on, Manuel, home. I'm not going back. What do you mean? What are you doing? I'm looking for the wind. Looking for the wind, my boy. You poor thing. See, Manuel. With this bagpipe, I learned to play. Your great-grandfather gave it to me. Inside you, you carry the sound and the air of your homeland. I came to the worst of lands in honor of his sacred name. It has gold and a wind and a cold that pervert reason. But I won't stop fighting in his beloved name against barbarism, - against ignorance. - Against the myths. From now on you will have to fight a myth. Come here. I will show you the beginning of the world. Don't go. Why not? I'll be back. - You're never coming back. - Yes, my love. I see it in your eyes. - I'll always carry you with me. - Get up, Galician. Get up and keep playing. Stand up, Galician. Keep playing, for all the outcasts at the end of the world. Keep playing, Galician, or I'll have to kill you. Leave here! Get out of here! Leave this place! This foreigner was sea food. Our people will have the same fate. This man is frozen, but his heart wants to live. A man who does not fight for life is worse than death. Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here! Foreigners are strange to us and they defile us with their customs. Why not pardon this man that brings the wind and can make it sing? He will teach us ways of defeating the invaders. His outlook is obvious. Let's make him a friend. Time passed, (Voicing) and I'm alone in delirium. The winds of madness, they're whipping me. I'm not me anymore. I don't know who I am. I am possessed by demons that howl like mad dogs. Oh, my Lady. My Lady! What to do, my Lady? Novak! I want our men ready to go! They will replace the Indians at work. What did you say, Sir? That our men will replace the Indians at work. Open the gate! Animals! Mad dogs! Speak up, Novak. I say again, they could have attacked us at night, but they didn't. I think the Indians are sending a message. Sir, we are poorly supplied and the Indians know these grasslands better than us. But we, Novak, are civilized. We have the strength, the power. - They must understand. - They're wild, Sir. Wild. I'll find them. Where are they? Where are they hiding? Show me your faces painted red, blue, green, yellow. Here I am! Waiting for you! There they are, Sir! After them! He has a lot of men. Popper got reinforcements. Where are they hiding? -I can't see them. - They're in the woods, Sir. On the flanks, buried in the middle of the Bush. They wait for us, but we have to be more patient than them. The bottom of the world is stained with blood, but now it'll be the invaders' blood that will flow. There are the devils. I see them too, sir. Your order to attack? What are you waiting for, General Novak? Let's get rid of these savages right now. Desert Land Army, Attack! Silveira! Sound the attack! What kind of commander am I who leads his men to death? Our blood had to run. You could have left before the battle. No one would blame you. You are mistaken. I would have scorned myself for that. But now I've had it, Brother. Sorry about the fucking bagpipes. You will play them again. I promise. That was my dream. I saw you surrounded by a great light playing your bagpipes over the meadows. Let us bury our dead! Let's bury them! Let's bury them! Fleeting gold. Petty gold, (Voicing) gold is mud, gold is fear, gold is blood, gold is death, gold is betrayal, gold is envy. Gold is loss! My Lady! My Lady, I pray against my solitude. Why did you choose me? Novak! Novak! It was hard to remove, Sir. But the wound is clean, no problems. The Indians! Damn Indians! They ambushed you, sir. We took casualties. How many? Eleven men and several horses. They killed my men. Bury them with military honors. I can't, Sir. They tore apart the body of every man, and scattered them to all corners of the prairie. Fucking savages. And right now the Indians have us surrounded. Well armed with stone tipped wooden arrows, and the like. Wooden arrows, stones! What do you suggest? It's a war, Sir. War. Act accordingly, General. Leave it to me. You rest, Sir. (Dreams) I, Carmen Silva, Queen of Romania, command you to clear the Land Of Fire of Indians and demons. No good for war. No good for training. No one understands discipline. Shit! Everybody line up here. Quick! Curse your dead asses. You, get over there! You too, hurry it up! Come on, get in a straight line. And you, look at all this heavy grease. Low lifes! It's been four weeks. Four weeks, by God, and always the same. Don't you have any brains? These mock-up grass dolls they know more about discipline than you. What do you think an army is? What is it? You, Cardenas. Come here, leave that. Take that doll and bring it here. This puppet is worth more than you. He's worth more than a soldier. You will see in this war. How treacherous people are. I'm to build an army with what? With vermin that wanders the prairie? Look here, all these dolls gotta be on horseback, men. What are you doing? I'm tired of waiting. I want my gold and go. Yeah, let's go! By this time, Popper must be dead. - What are you talking about? - The gold! The gold! We want it now! We want our gold! This is rebellion! We want gold. That's what we want, right now! But why? If Popper is.. Each of you needs me. Only I know where the gold is hidden. Their lives are tied to my destiny. If I live, they'll get rich. If I die, they will die with me. We live with you, we will die if you die! We live with you, we will die if you die! Starting today I will reward you with an ounce of gold for each testicle, breast, or ear off these rebel Indians. as a sign of our crusade for civilization. Tread the warpath, Desert Land Army! We live for you, we will die if you die! We live for you, we will die if you die! ♪ Where does Mennar our Queen go? Mennar goes with friends and family to the sea. I, Mennar, go to the sea with my family. What part of Italy are you from? Brindisi. As a child, the sound of the sea relaxed me. - And don't you want to go back? -Yes but only as a rich man. Apparently, nothing can stop you. Nothing. No hunger, no cold, no pain. Not even love? No, not even love. You speak like a king. On leaving for America, my mother said, " You will be a king." Is the meat ready? Just about. What was your mother like, beautiful? She was a very, very beautiful woman. Like me? I'll tell you. You.. Me? You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. Give me another. Popper. Does death disgust you, Italian? If you have to live, you have to kill. What if you have to die? I didn't come here to die, I have other plans. I'm not an invader, I'm an immigrant. You think too much, that's your problem, Italian. It wouldn't hurt you to think a little, you drunken Hungarian. We kill Indians, right? They pay us for it. But who will work collecting gold? Relax, Popper knows what he's doing. Me too. That's at least three of us who know what we're doing. Armenia. Get her out of your head, Italian. Drink less and think a little. Shit! In Magellan, ordinary and mediocre men, they put a price on my head. I, Julius Popper, I am the legend. The rest is misery and fear. - Give me this. - Go away, you harlot. Desert Land Army! Now we have won an important victory. Schaeffer, give these men food and drink. Let there be no lack of brandy or wine. That's better. It is no longer inflamed. You see how I take care of you, my girl. (Untranslated) Oh, what a pity! I can't understand you but one day you will understand me. Because you're gonna be my wife, the wife of a rich man. Mrs. General Novak. Here's the gold. But today this is not the most important thing. The most important thing today is that civilization triumphed over barbarism. Every Indian killed is like another word on the tapestry upon which is woven the great civilizing feats, the great epics of progress! Do you have a name? It's not important. I'll call you Elisa. Yes. Elisa. Your name is Elisa. Dozens of ears, testicles, woman's breasts. But ears that do not know music. Animals that do not command the human language, that emit wild grunts. Ears deaf to development. What need have they for them? Now we have corrected a small flaw of God's. This dress was from another Elisa. But now it's yours. You are no longer wild. You are now a woman as God commanded. - Long Live Julius Popper! - Hooray! Desert Land Army, I am proud to lead you. Here is the gold, brave soldiers. You fought with courage. Novak! Where is my brave general Novak? Mennar! Who put that wicked noose on you? What have they done to you, Mennar? It's my Indian, Sir. I picked it up to serve me. My little bitch. I knew you would drive men mad. Quiet! Her! She's a queen. She's just an Indian, Sir. Shut up, Novak. Sir, I beg your pardon, this is my Indian, Elisa. Elisa. Elisa. What a beautiful name. Elisa. Elisa! Long live Queen Elisa! - Hooray! Sir, ask the men to stop drinking. Schaeffer, Give cachaça to the men and let them toast (local rum) to this beautiful flower of the desert land. Sir, I'm saying for the last time. This is my Indian. Yours? This woman has served me and will reign with me. What are you doing, you bastard? I've made my claim, Sir. This Indian is mine. Everything that exists in the Land Of Fire belongs to me. Those thing are yours, you already got the rest. My queen, Everything is yours: My bed, my instruments, my writings. I'll never be able to repair the evil they did to you. Speak to me. Please speak to me. Tell me at least one word. The same one you said on the night I took off your chains, remember? Tell me! Tell me! Say something. I'll give you everything. Everything. Clothes. Jewelry. Everything, Gold. Everything. Tell me. Don't touch my stuff! You crazy fuck! You will pay dearly for this! Don't become a Judas, Armenia, because I won't forgive you. This is my big moment. Hear how my men cheer me. And this queen is confirmation of my triumph. I am Julius Popper King of Tierra del Fuego and Patagonia. Come on! If you want to save yourself, do as I say. This ship is sinking. Whatever you wish, missus. Change out of those drunkard's clothes. We'll meet at the apartment. Be quick! Halt! This is how our disgraced general behaves? What happened? You don't say anything? Did the Indian eat your tongue? Shoot. If you came to kill me, shoot. I'm a soldier. Ready! Aim! Fire! Your time has not yet come, Novak. First, we have to take the crazy Romanian's gold. Armenia and Spiro are waiting for us half a league from here, come on. Cosimo Spiro, Armenia, and Novak, poker aces! The damn Romanian's hours are numbered. Come on, Novak. Let's go! The dogs have begun to bite each other. A good sign. Look, Spiro, we have another puppy to kill when we're done with the cubs. The Romanian belongs to me. When he falls into my hands, he'll wish to never have been born. Spiro, distribute the ammo and organize the guards. (EN,sic) Senor, like a hundred men has come to the revolution. Popper is alone, drunk. It's good. What about Elisa? She's staying with him, Mr. Novak. - Long Live Julius Popper! - Hooray! - Julius Popper is a God! - He's a God! Popper God? Yes, my queen. Drive out the invaders and their sheep herds. My people will join you and you will be our only God. An offer of an alliance with the Indians is very convenient, General. Let us burn all the sheep. Let the smoke reach the sky! As a sign of our alliance. Is this Popper's bed? It's the belly of a whale. How was it with him? Did you like it? Popper was neither bad nor good. Popper is nobody. Popper was never in this bed. Tomorrow you will be the winner. When you win, I will be your princess. Have courage tomorrow. This will bring you luck. Kill Popper. Kill him. They will confront each other and then we will attack. It is the order of Mennar. The criminal leaves his Fortress. What is he up to? Going to the hill crest. What for? To attack his own puppets? No, Hungarian. He goes because he doesn't know who he has to fight. And he wants to confuse us. But I'm going up and force him into the valley. You stay here entrenched and Spiro goes around the left. We'll close a circle and crush him. Kill him. You made me go against Popper. He always had a lot of affection for me. Popper is a living lie. Pair every grass doll, with a real soldier. Everyone earns an ounce of gold and twice that for the heads of the traitors: Schaeffer, Novak, Spiro, and Armenia. In the name of Her Majesty, Carmen Silva, Queen of Romania, Patagonia, and Tierra del Fuego, Attack! It's Popper! Aim and shoot! Spiro, Armenia, don't leave! Attack! Come back here. Fucking Hell! Attack! Fucking Romanian! He fooled me with my own tactic. Don't leave me alone! Don't leave me alone! Victory! Victory! All who surrender, I'll spare your lives. Let the whole world know the generosity of Julius Popper. And to all of you I say that from today I will look upon you as subjects, because that's the way I have to love you all. From today, orders I give you are edicts because it's the only way that I have for them to be faithfully obeyed. From today, I shall be the sole Sovereign. Because it's the only way I have to be with everyone. Civilization or death! Hurrah! The men are now on Popper's side. He has defeated us. No. No. Yesterday I was a whore and you a miserable mercenary. Today we are two immigrants. Fucking Romanian. The real machine making gold were my bitches. I can buy the land where Popper cleaned out the Indians. We will be ranchers. I'm at the end. I climbed to the top of the mountain and from there I saw Paradise. We're all the same! Is that clear? I declare the end of all hierarchy. and the equality of races in the Land Of Fire. I am Julius Armenia Popper, the Ruler of this fucking shit hole. I bring a message from the landowners of Magellan. Only the dead are equal, Popper. Hurray, Popper! Long live Julius Popper! Julius Popper! Come with me. Mennar. Mennar! There is another world, ours. I need you, Julius Popper. I can't, Mennar, I'm tired, far from home. Come with me! Come with me, Julius Popper! Come with me! Come with me! Come with me! I didn't serve you. Nor did you, me. JULIUS POPPER IS GONE FOREVER FROM THE LAND OF FIRE, MENNAR AND THE ONAS PEOPLE WENT TO SEA AND NEVER CAME BACK. THE QUEEN OF ROMANIA NEVER KNEW OF HER DISTANT KINGDOM. TO THIS DAY, NO ONE HAS FOUND ANY MORE GOLD IN THE TIERRA DEL FUEGO. THE MEN ARE GONE. ONLY THE SHEEP REMAIN. ♪ The Queen of Romania, she never knew what she had. They say the Indian, Elisa, called herself Mennar again. The suffering Indians insist on forgetting. Cosimo Spiro, He became a great landowner, and beside the beautiful Armenia became a man of honor. Many stories are told in Karukinka. (Area within Tierra del Fuego) Many stories are told. There are many more, in the Land of Fire, in the Land of Fire ♪ Historical notes: Inhabited for 10,000 years, in 1520 Magellan originally named the island "Land of Smokes". European settlement grew from 1860 when sheep ranchers began government sanctioned displacement of natives. In 1883 a gold rush began that lasted until 1910. Julius Popper came to the Island in 1886 with a license to extract gold and a band he formed into mercenaries. He warred against the Selk'nam people. The Selk'nam population, also called "Ona", was reduced from 4,000 to less than 100. Known to be an amiable people, they were deported, killed, or enslaved. Bounties paid were higher for proof of women who were killed. Skulls were sent to museums, as were some enslaved to be circus exhibits. The enslaved were forbidden to procreate, but women were made into wives and also used as currency. Many died of European diseases spread by Anglican missions. There was no prosecution for deliberate genocide, but one leader was presented a gold watch for the result. The last Selk'nam died in 1974 and their language is extinct. At age 35, It is believed Julius Popper was murdered by poisoning. In 2022 his life was celebrated in a Romanian synagogue as a noted Jew with 100 of his photos. It included the posed photo of him astride the body of a slain Selk'nam. Thanks for reading my subtitles this far. Your friend, Quester.
