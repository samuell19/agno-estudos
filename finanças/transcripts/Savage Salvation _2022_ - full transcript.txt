My family goes to St. Baptist Stop 260, right? Yeah. Well, I was-- I was thinking that maybe I would start going with them. What? Don't laugh with me. I'm-- I'm not laughing at you. I just-- Fuck, I didn't know that you were religious and all. I'm talking about structure. I think it might help us get sober. Since when do you want that? Since this. I don't think I can do it. Um, I felt we tried to get before it. It's goddamn nightmare. I never wanted you to be like me. Hey, I love you. I think that we can do it. Together. Shit, so we're gonna do this, huh? Yes. Yeah?

Ain't stolen, is she? You looking for a stolen ring, you're in the wrong goddamn shop, boy. No. I have 450. I might be willing to bend a little, but not much. And don't ask me for no layaway. Okay, then I'll be back for it when I got the money. Can't promise you it'll still be here. She'll be here. Oh! Oh fuck. Where you been, cuz? I'm in hurry, Elvis. Cash flow issues? What? Why didn't you say so? Just enough to tie you and your little lady over. Fuck, fuck, no man. No, I don't want that fucking shit. Me and Ruby, we're clean now. That a fact? Yeah. I'm gonna ask Ruby about that by myself. No. No, you don't. I need you to stay away from her. All those times I fronted you. Now you act like I'm some shit you can just scrape off your boot? 85 bucks. It's all I got. For you to stay the fuck away from me and Ruby. She ain't get by me. That's why I get paid the big bucks for. You know what? What? No, don't... See? Swear to god, I got worried. Now you got nothing better to do than sit around and worry about me? I know how hard it must be working all day for us like you do. But it's gonna be worth it. I just saw Elvis. Did you take something? Is that what you think of me? You're the one who just came in here acting all weird telling me that you saw Elvis when-- Well, I didn't. This time. Fuck. I'm sorry, what are you saying? I just-- I don't think I can do this.

You paying taxes these days, Elvis? You ain't got a side hustle for fares, do you now? I'm Sheriff Church. Get your hands off my vehicle. Hey, no disrespect. Oh, shit! Fuck! Goddammit, you gave me a heart attack. Huh? Hah! Guess what? What? The thrift shop hired me. Well, of course, they did. What'd I tell you? Yeah, well, it's only part time for now. But they have the cutest stuff. And I got you a present. Oh, you hate it. No. No, no, I don't hate it. You hate it. Yes, you do. Gee, I don't think I've worn a button-up since my fucking graduation. I like this one better. Yeah? You like it? Yeah, I like it a lot. Hey, thank you. You're welcome. I mean it, thank you. Well, I mean it, you're welcome. Guess what? What? Got you a present, too. -No, you didn't. -I did. No, you didn't. I gotta take you to it though. No, you-- Yes, I do. Oh, I gotta take you to the present. It's all the way in the bedroom. I'm so sorry. I did, oh my goodness. You are so... Hey, I love you, Ruby Red. I love you more, Shelby John. Shelby, Ms. Red. Hey, Mike, how's it going? Goes right, I suppose. Like the whirl or like the toilet? There is a perspective of it. It's like the whirl! Well, I have to admit, it's nice to see your friends happy. We made it. Ruby Red. Hey, Peter. Hi, hey. Good to see you. Hey, Shelby John. How are you doing? Look at you two. Isn't it amazing? Now, your girl here, has even been helping out at the church. We gonna see you there anytime soon? I don't know, maybe. Maybe. -Yeah. -Maybe. Yeah. Aunty Rubs. Oh my God, Conor. You're getting so big. You better stop growing. Hey look, we got you a present. Happy birthday. And I think you're gonna like it. Thanks. Boy, what a hall. It's all you? Dar, are you decent? Only sometimes. Aw, you sound like mama. Oh. Mm, busy becoming a mama. Oh my, that's right. I forgot that ain't your little tiny beer belly no more. Oh, stop. You're glowing. What you want with that thing, little sis? For real? Yeah. Oh my God. Ah, maybe don't be so mean about it, 'cause he's saving up for real one. And I kind of like this one right now. So, you know. Oh. I'm happy for you, little girl. Yeah. So how you doing? I'm still sober, if that's what you're asking me right now. Oh, girl. That's fucking great! Come on, you should be proud of yourself. What, sweetie? I'm just so scared. We trust in your wisdom. And we look forward to our boy Conor getting washed in the blood. Amen. Amen. Aren't you gonna have any? Mama, I think Ruby has something to tell y'all. Is that right, Darda? Oh well, we were thinking about-- Getting hitched. Hey, how about that? Well, congratulations, you two. Shelby John, you're a lucky man. Yeah, I know. You didn't even ask me. Lord knows we've had our share of differences. But Ruby is my baby. You didn't think to ask my permission to take her hand? To be honest, since her daddy's out the picture, I-- I didn't think about asking permission. But I can see now that was sort of sexist, like on my part. That baby girl has broke my heart more than once. Ain't gonna lie about that now just 'cause she's gone clean a couple of weeks. Clean about over a month, mama. Mama's talking, Darda. Greta, with all due respect, I'm marrying your daughter no matter what. What I can do is I-- I can swear to take care of her till my dying breath. I suppose what I'm asking for is a little faith. Faith is something I do have. Don't you let me down, Shelby John. I won't. Here I was listening, this fine day cannot get any sweeter, but I do love to be proven wrong. Because being proven wrong keeps us humble. Just, life is filled with trials and tribulations. We all struggle. But it is the way we confront those struggles that defines us. So, this to the happy couple. Welcome to the family, Shelby John. Pain in the ass, don't get me started. Yeah. You should come work for me. It's a good wage, health insurance. If Ruby is anything like her sister, she's not gonna wait too long to have a baby. Hey, you don't have to answer now. Just put it back here. I will, thank you. I scored us some extra cake. Can't leave without this. Take it, girl. Oh my God, are you sure? Of course, I'm sure. Go and get it fitted. Oh. Do you like it? It's beautiful. Thank you. Thanks. See you later. Bye.

When you're remembered, dreamt about. Looks like a fallen angel. I just saw her last week on Shelby's bike. She looked happy, they looked happy. It wasn't him. She did this herself. My guess is Shelby John ain't gonna be easy to find. He was always a wild one, Shelby John. My boy Mickey played ball with him. Called him "Mustang". Fast as a horse on the fuel, wild and dangerous off him. So this Mustang can kick. Oh, he can kick alright but he won't screw with his burbon. He didn't start that fight. I'm sure as hell he'll finish it. Or maybe it's not too late for Shelby John. It's gotta be me. If anybody else gets to him first-- Sheriff. They were fixing the place up. Shelby John's problem is knowing when to stop. If you find him, you stay calm and tell him I just wanna talk. That's all. You got it, boss. Who is it? - Friend of your dad's. - Go get him. If you're a friend, you know not to come here for drug. Get your daddy, or I'm gonna kick down this whole goddamn wall. Whatever, dude. It's your funeral. Dad, some fucker's at the door. I'll take care of this. Who is it? Hey, move your hand, asshole. Fuck, man. Shelby? Stay the fuck down. Shelby, whatever he done, I'm sure it was a mistake. He didn't mean-- Take your kids fuck out of here. You wanna stay or you wanna go? I'll go, I'll go. I'm sorry, baby. I fucking told you, and I told you again we were clean. I won't give Ruby nothing else. I'll-- I'll stay away. Don't even gotta pay me. She's dead. Fuck! I'm so sorry, Shelby. You gotta understand, I've been getting squeezed to bring my numbers up. What'd you give her? Just a little smack. She got Smack, what else? That's--that's it. I said what else? I had to cut it. I told you, I've been getting squeezed like you wouldn't believe. Who is your supplier? What? Give me his name and maybe I'll leave here while you're still breathing. I can't give you that. Please don't fucking kill me. Please don't fucking kill me, man. I'm gonna ask you one more fucking time. Your supplier? I don't know where that shit comes from. I'll fucking kill you like cattle. I don't fucking know, man. I swear I don't. Okay, okay. Darius. Darius! Address? I don't fucking know. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay. I pick up my gear in Columbus, The Brown hotel. Different room every night. That's all I know, man. Please, fucking come on, man. You've seen my family. Just please... They're better off without you. Everybody is. Four shots fired. Past of 187 on Freedom drive. Two black and white-- Suspect's armed and can be seen on a black motorcycle. Headed northbound on 185. I repeat, suspect's armed headed north on 1I-85. I just can't the fuck. I can't, fuck. Oh! Hi there. Where did you come from? You got your mama over there? Think you better go back to your mama. Jesus Christ died for our sins. Elvis Kincaid died for his own. Nailed straight through the forehead. Church, you questioned the family? Church? Church? Yeah, I got it. Oh, come on, Sheriff. How long we're gonna be here? We've already been through enough tonight already. I know it, Jess. But I wouldn't be asking if it wasn't important. I just want to talk to the oldest. Well, that's Travis. Travis it is. Alright, only with me present. Right, let's go. You're on babysitting duty. The hell I am. How old are you? 11. How old? 11. You know, my son used to play football with your dad. Really? Was he any good? Yeah, your dad held his own on the line. He had a good team. Damn good. You know what your old man did for a living? Umm... Don't look to your mama now. Now, come on. Well, my friends used to say my dad was the best dad. Like, taking care of people. Taking care of people how? Like, with medicine. Travis? No, shut your mouth, Jess. Or we all spend the rest of the night in interrogation room. You know where you dad keeps his medicine? Travis, look at me. I don't know, sir. I'm sorry. Watch it. What the fuck, man? Asshole. Excuse me, can I help you? I've come to see a friend. I see. Enjoy, sir. Hey, how you guys doing? How you doing, Mister? I'm doing pretty good. You guys partying? Oh, shit. You know where I can buy me some of them pills? We got no pills, officer. Can you not do that? My fucking nose, man. Hey. Let Kenny go. Please, Mister. He didn't mean nothing by it. I asked him a question. Our friend Skeeter, he gets the pills from someone down the hall. Oh yeah? Skeeter? Which room? Don't tell him. Hey. 1507. 1507. Thank you. Thanks, Kenny. Ah, that's right. Oxycodone, D-- Demerol. It's a form of fentanyl. No doubt that Kincaid was putting this into his heroin. This little brick has left a whole lot of searching in its wake. Who that? Kenny. Oh, do you need some more shit, huh, college boy? Ah! Oh my God. Fucking hell. Hey. Ah! Ah! Fuck, ah! Jesus, fuck. Stay down. Alright, stay down! You can suck my dick, you fucking bitch-ass. No, I'm good. Tell him. Man said stay down, Skeeter. Time to go, ladies. So that's Skeeter. You are? Darius. Darius. You can call me, "the Kin killer". Oh, just heard about that. Kincaid was a piece of shit. But the man did have a family. You know? I don't. Not anymore. Not since you were leaning on Kincaid to sell more. I'm getting leaned on too, brother. Believe me. You want money? There's 10 grand right there in front of you. I got no need for money where I'm going. You got that right, motherfucker. Just shut up, man. You after my supplier? I don't give a fuck. I'll give you his name. You let me walk. Fuck, Darius. You wanna get us both gutted? Coyote is fucking-- Ah! Fuck. Coyote? That's what he calls himself. Yeah. And I know something he don't know I know. Where he lives. Y'all dead. Y'all both fucking dead. Just watch your mouth, boy. The grown-ups is talking. That girl on the news they saying you killed. That's what they're saying, huh? That's what this is about? Your dumb bitch can't handle her shit. So you come around here swinging your dick like a fucking punk? That shit pathetic, dog. Fuck. Oh God, motherfucker! Fuck! Man, I'm sorry about your girl. I truly am. But I didn't even know her. That's what make it worse, isn't it? It didn't matter to Kincaid. Don't matter to you. Don't matter to some dumb fuck calls himself "Coyote". So where does he live? Don't tell him shit, Darius. Don't say-- Fuck! You motherfucker! He's got a big old fucked up house out in Quinton county off a Tea Lake Road right next to Floyd's Fork. Took me hunting there once with his weird-ass crew to intimidate me. You believe that shit? Did he? Did he what? Intimidate you? Honest, ain't nobody in my life ever scared me like that dude. Don't leave him breathing. I may come back here one day.

She said that life is a river that eventually spills into the ocean. And when you get to the delta where the river meets the sea, that's where your loved ones will be waiting for you.

As well as the shooting of Skeeter Burg another suspected drug dealer in Columbus. Hello, you've reached Wild Cat Tracking, Georgia's finest shipping and logistics company. If you know the extension of the party you're trying to reach, dial it now. Shelby John. You've been busy. You believe in God? Been in church every Sunday in my life. Ain't what I asked. I do. Do you? I do now. Gave Ruby over to the hands of God when I put her in that river. And now you're doing God's work. Is that it? You think God approves of what you've been doing? You know, I didn't want to admit it to myself. But I was relieved when Sheriff Church caught up to me. Didn't know I wanted to be stopped until I was stopped. And things kept going. Out of my control. If that wasn't God pushing me to do his business, I don't know what it was. Everything I've done, I've done for my family. Does Darlene know what you do? Don't you worry about Darlene. And Conor? Boy's sound asleep upstairs, not a care in the world. Because all his needs are provided for him.
