Writers in our country are improving day by day. Formerly they used to come for the Iiterary meet on cycles.. But now they arrive by cars. Yes, yes. I owned a cycle too Iast year.. But I had to seII it off to pubIish my novel. Let's go. - Yes. Respected Chairman, Dr. Baneriee.. ..Dr. Kulkarni and gentlemen.. I thank Rustomji Petit Trust through.. ..this Iiterary association for.. ..announcing the Saraswati Award and encouraging the writers. This award is given to the best book of the year. This year the most amazing fact is that.. ..this is the writer's first work. And the writer is a doctor. Doctor Bhaskar Banerjee. He's not only famous in his medical fieId and aIcohoI.. Please mention only medicine. Forgive me, Dr. Baneriee is well known for his medicines and.. Not for aIcohoI. He is a remarkable cancer specialist. Inspite of being surrounded by such situations.. ..writing a noveI like Anand is very astonishing. Before giving away the award l request Dr Banerjee.. ..to say a few words about his noveI 'Anand'. Where and how did he find the inspiration to write it. I.. Excuse me but I don't know what to say.. FrankIy speaking, I'm no writer. My habit of writing begins and ends with my diary. And what you assume as my story or noveI.. ..are a few extracts from my diary. If you feeI that Anand is fiction or my imagination.. Then the fault Iies in my writing. It is in fact my failure. Anand loved to make friends. Every place he went, he was in search of a friend. That's why l published my novel. So that his friendship should spread throughout the world. When l first met Anand my mind was not stable. I was very disappointed with my medicaI profession. After watching all kinds of diseases, poverty and disaster.. ..l had lost all hopes in life. l was heIpless. I couId combat diseases.. ..but how couId l deal with hunger and poverty? I tried to battle but didn't have the right weapons. I noticed that Iakhs of peopIe lacked in vitamins. But when they were starving what was the use of vitamins. Medicines couId cure diseases but not poverty. Yet after so many years of independence.. ..people don't have the money to buy saIt. How can I ask them to buy medicines? Doctor. - lt's not in my hands. Doctor, pIease do something. - What can l do? Am l God? Go and pray. Doctor, have some sweets, Laxmi had a baby boy. My grandson. One just died and another is born ready for death. I admit that life is stronger than death. But isn't this Iife worse than death. When l took my degree from college, I vowed to save Iives. And now at every step I feeI l'm trying to save death. Munna. Won't you have your meaIs? You have it, uncle. If l feel like it, I'Il eat later. What kind of a doctor are you? Your father was a doctor too. He used to work day and night, but he never ignored food. He aIso made money and bought this property. You're not interested in money making. You're onIy working hard. Your friend Prakash has built such a large hospitaI. Raghu uncIe leave me alone. Will you do me a favour? - What? Bring a daughter-in-law in this house.. Then l shaII go back to my viIIage. I mean it. I have brought you up.. So I can't watch your condition nor Ieave you aIone. Hey, Raghu uncIe. come on, serve me food. It's better than marriage. Park the car ahead. Hello doctor. - Please wait, I'm examining him. I'm in a hurry. - You can come tomorrow. Fine, l shaII wait then. Take this address and get an X-Ray done. Is it necessary for an X-Ray? I am giving two more music lessons.. So my throat must have ripped and it's bleeding now. Anything can happen, but go and get an X-Ray done. What happened? - No nothing, but the X-Ray.. You know my condition. -You don't have to pay. l'll caIl him. Dr. Prakash KuIkarni. Go and meet him. Doctor, have my reports come? Yes. PIease be seated. You're perfectIy alI right. You Iook disappointed. - No. Dr. Kulkarni mentioned that you're a cancer expert. Expert in what. In giving cancer or curing it? It's aIright, doctor. But I've developed a new complication. I don't get sleep and I feeI tired during the day. Give me some good medicine. You Iove to take medicines, don't you? If l give you some colorful capsuIes or tabIets.. Or teII you a medicine which is unavaiIable.. Then you'Il be satisfied and believe l'm a good doctor. If you can give me some medicine, then do so.. ..else there's no dearth of doctors. Please leave. What are your consuItation fees? I take fees for medicines not for giving some sense. Dr. Kulkarni, pIease. Dr. Banerjee. Prakash, I'm Bhaskar here. I'm sending a boy for an X-Ray. His name is Ranjit. Examine him. Do you have the samples of streptomycin. Keep some for me. Whose letter? Trivedi. The Gynecologist from Delhi, he's writing after a Iong time. Yes. I'm going to the Iaboratory in the afternoon.. ..and l'll be there by 4.00 p.m. Okay? Sister. - Good morning, Dr. Banerjee. Is Dr. KuIkarni in? - Yes, he's waiting for you. Remember Mrs. SanyaI take the green.. ..and red capsuIes together.. ..and after half an hour the pink tablets. Next the green and yellow capsules.. ..and half an hour Iater the pink tablets. And yes, the white tablets that I prescribed, continue them.. One in the morning and in the evening. I'm sorry. - No probIem, Bhaskar, come in. Sit. I forgot to mention one thing. Something's wrong with me these days.. I feeI frightened. - Why? I had my bIouses stitched last month and they're tight now. It's a sanfriZe material. No, Mrs. SanyaI don't neglect it. I want to check your blood cholesteroI. Come next Saturday. Oh no, not Saturday, I've a kitty party. can't l come on Friday? - Friday.. Iet me check. Fine. Friday morning 9.00 a.m. - Okay. Here's the cheque for Iast month of Rs.500. Thank you. - Eh! I mean for this cheque. - lt's alright, doctor. Bye Bye. come, Bhaskar.. Please be seated. You're teIIing her about blood cholesteroI.. ..what does she know? You will aIways remain a doctor. If l don't create an impression, how will she gain confidence? Yes. I know what you'd have told her had she come to you. The same thing that you told chandranath and made him angry. Walk two hours in the morning and pIay two hours in the evening.. After 15 days she'd neither need you nor me. She'd be playing badminton leisurely.. ..and we'd be begging on the streets. If you wanted to do this why did you pass your medicaI? You could open a shop. If l'd sell milk I'd mix water into it.. And if l was a Iawyer.. ..l'd take money from the confIict and try to save him. I can reduce their stomach or toothache in this profession. Do you think this is right? There's nothing wrong with it, Bhaskar. The boy you sent for an X-Ray this morning. Yes, what happened? There's a T.B. patch on his left lung. I told him to come and get injected everyday. Do you think he can afford it? For such treatments l've to take money from Mrs. Sanyal. She's not paying free of charge. I know she's not sick. But she's has doubts about her heaIth.. I cure these doubts. What's wrong with that? I understand, Prakash. But don't you think something is wrong somewhere? Forget it. You won't understand and neither can l make you. This is Trivedi's letter and he's sent a case history. case history, but whose? Read it. He's got a friend, Anand Sehgal. I met him five years ago in DeIhi. We became good friends and he's very joviaI. What's wrong with him? - Lymphocercoma of the intestine. Lymphocercoma. Have they done a biopsy? What's the use of sending him here? Doesn't Trivedi know there's no cure? He knows. But Anand has no one. And he's still in the ambuIatory stage. He can move around and wants to see Bombay. And he wants to meet us. The treatment given there can be given here too. This is his X-Ray pIate.. have a look. What's there to see? In a few months, there'II be distention of stomach.. ..and the tumor wilI burst. Or there'II be acute anaemia and he can't breathe. He'II hardIy live for four to six months. Sir, one Mr. Anand SehgaI has arrived. Anand from DeIhi. He was going to come tomorrow. Send him inside. Where wiII he stay? At your home. Yes. I've made arrangements here. Bhaskar. He's Trivedi's best friend. He'II stay for three to four months and leave. As long as he's here we'Il have to.. - Friend.. Hello, friend. - Come, Anand, come. I told you we'd meet again, didn't l? Sit down. - l heard you're married. How's your wife? - Very fine. Any junior, senior.. - Not yet. You've been married for three years and.. ..you don't have a compounder yet.. Go and consuIt Trivedi. - How's Trivedi? His family planning is on. Two is more than enough. What about his chiIdren? - His children? Yes, two pIus three that's five, which is enough. Five? Anand, meet Dr. Bhaskar Banerjee. Babumushai. Girls called you Babumushai in college. Dr. Trivedi told me everything. I've heard that many girls had a crush on you. What now situation? Anand, you were supposed to come tomorrow. My aII work is Iike same. When l was born the doctor had advised.. ..l'd be born on the 21st but I came early. If the doctor mentions the date of my death.. ..l'll die early. And yes. I've kept my property in your office. My suitcase and a tape recorder. I've got cIothing but no bed. Don't worry, your bed is ready in the cabin above. You can stay here. I was showing your X-Ray to Dr. Banerjee. Oh, my fiIm show was being held here. Hey Babumushai, what did you find? I'll inform Trivedi don't worry about it. It concerns me.. why shouIdn't l worry? What do you want to know? - TeII me the disease. What wilI you achieve by knowing? I won't, but teII me. If l teII you, you've got Lymphocercoma.. What wilI you understand? - What? Repeat it. Lymphocercoma of the intestine. Splendid! What a name! Sounds like a Viceroy's name. What a great disease. You're a great doctor, Babumushai. Wow, what a name. Lymphocercoma of the intestine. It sounds Iike an announcement on the radio. I swear.. If women were suffering from this disease.. ..it would sound like she's adopted an English Baby. This is no joke. Do you know the meaning of Lymphocercoma? Do the meaning of this disease? There's a dreadful tumour in my stomach.. ..and l won't Iive for more than six months. Maybe that's the medical name for it. But why are you angry all of a sudden? I understand. You're not angry with me but yourseIf.. ..because I can't be cured. So much Iove is not good. can I examine you once? - Why? What's wrong with me? Give me your hand. - The pulse is here. No chance. What's your age. - Thirty. Thirty. lf you minus 30 from 100, what remains? Seventy. - Seventy. You won't live for more than 70. Do you know what's your problem? Your body is deteriorating slowly. What do you mean? What's the difference in 70 years and six months? Death comes in a second. But in these six months I'll live every moment. Babumushai, Iife shouId be great.. not long. You are too much. If you're scared of death.. What's the essence of death? As long as l'm alive, l'm not dead. When l'm dead, l'm not there. So why be scared of death? I'm sorry, Sir, Anand. Sir? Babumushai, Iife is short and time is fleeting.. ..we've to Iive fast. And be quick.. At least cut down on the respects. What's your opinion? - Fine, he'Il do that.. Yes, sir. Sister, there's a cabin above. Take him there.. I'll be coming aIong. Anand, you'll be examined in two days. Sure. This is the only examination.. ..in which the one who gives is not studying.. ..but the one who takes it has to. Let's go, sister. Forgive me. Trivedi had warned me not to joke with you.. But what couId l do? lt's a habit. ReaIIy. Bhaskar, he know's he's dying.. ..yet he's so lively and.. Maybe that's why he.. What do you think? can something be done? - Nothing, the disease is such.. UntiI secondary manifestation, we can't detect anything. But by then it's too late. Nothing can be done. Keep the things here. If you need anything more, ring the beIl. Where are you going? - l'm on duty. But who'II take care of me? - l wiII, don't worry. Let's sit and taIk. I'm aII alone. Are you scared of being aIone? No, I'm not. But I want someone to taIk to. Oh! You can do one thing. There's a mirror there.. Sit in front of it and talk. I've tried that. lt's boring. Our matron wiII be coming now, meet her. She's very sweet. What are you doing here? - l was in the cabin.. Don't you know the visiting hours? No. I don't. You can't meet any patient before 4 o' cIock. Oh. And if l want to meet the doctor? Go to the office. You'II know the ruIes. Sister. Can't we break them sometimes? All right, but why shouId we break ruIes? Anand, what are you doing here? Everyone who comes here is asking this. Is this a hospitaI or a school? A teacher asked the same question. Now the headmaster. Doctor, there is no patient in the cabin. The patient is very naughty, sister. You'II have to use a cane to look after him. Anand, meet our matron, Mrs. D'sa. Sister, he's our patient.. Anand. come, sister. Let's go to the cabin. come in, sister. Please be seated. So you're the matron. I heard you taIk a lot. - Shut up. Is this how you talk? Didn't you hear me? Lie down quietIy. One can't die quietIy, sister.. we must make a sound. In 24 hours, we spend eight hours sleeping.. And four hours in eating and drinking. 50% remain. If l live for a year, six months wiII be over. If l live for six, three months are over. If l live for three, l'II Iose one month. - I said shut-up. Okay. Lie down. l toId you Iie down. Today l met Anand SehgaI from DeIhi. I felt as if a tornado had swept into the room. He laughed and joked every minute.. Yet knowing that his death was near. I wonder if he was Iaughing at death or life. Is Babumushai in? - Babumushai? Yes, the doctor. - Yes, he is. Your name? Anand. TeII him Anand is here. Mr. Anand. - What did we decide? Say me you. Okay. How did you come here? I ran away. What kind of a friend are you? You caged me there and disappeared. If you want me there you'II have to stay with me. I won't stay aIone. But it's necessary for you. - No, it's not. If l have to live, l have to Iaugh. I'll faII sick in that nursing home. I haven't come for treatment. I know everything. I have come to meet you folks here. Babumushai, neither do I have anyone nor do you.. As long as l'm alive Iet me stay here. Yes, you can. But have you informed the nursing home? No, I haven't, but I have Ieft a note for the matron. Please caII my friend and inform him. Raghu uncIe.. Where's your Iuggage? - ln the nursing home. No problems. Raghu uncIe, take him upstairs. Make arrangements in the adjoining room. I'll caIl Prakash and inform him. Raghu uncIe, sit down. We can check the room Iater. Sit down. Tell me who cooks here? - Me. I hope you cook weII. I've two hobbies in Iife.. Talk and eat. When l taIk a lot, I eat as welI. can't you see my health? come, take me to the kitchen. come. Hello, is Prakash there? Where's he gone? This is Baneriee speaking. At my place, both of them? Okay, fine. I'm calling from home. come, Prakash, where's your wife? She's coming. How did you know? I just called your place. - ReaIIy? Hello, sister-in-Iaw, you surprised me. Suman has come to invite you. Invite me? l'm fortunate. What's speciaI? Three years ago l committed a mistake, she wants to ceIebrate. Oh, your wedding anniversary! He's smart. He reaIised what mistake l meant. He made the mistake but I got caught in it. What? come in. come. Babumushai. Your Raghu Kaka has made exceIIent.. I'm caught. - How did you come here? It's not my fauIt. Babumushai forced me to. I told him you'd be angry. He said he'd explain.. ..and wouIdn't say anything. Don't be angry with him, he's all aIone. Yes. I understand. - You do? Meet her, she's Suman, my.. Hello, sister-in-Iaw. Forgive me, l didn't see you. He's trying to introduce us. ActuaIly I came from Delhi to meet you. Me! - l had an important work. What work? - Sing that song.. ..which you did before your marriage for my friend. Why friend? What a Iocation for a song! Who told you about it? As if you don't know. You must have told him. I don't like this. You embarrass me in front of others. But I realIy didn't teIl him. - Yes, he didn't telI me. It's astroIogy. I can do face reading. Your father beat you up before your marriage. No, never. - Don't lie and don't feeI shy. Remember, you went to the movies at Metro cinema.. ..and you'd sit in the Kit-Kat restaurant opposite.. ..the cinema and have food with my friend. Your father saw you one evening and beat you up.. Am I right? Now tell me you didn't reveal anything. Yes, tell her. Trivedi must have toId you. - That means you toId Trivedi. No dear. What's the use of fighting now? Please sing that song. Please, Bhabhi (sister-in-Iaw). Yes, Bhabhi - Yes. Bhabhi. Why are you caIIing me Bhabhi? I folIowed the majority. I'm teIling the truth. I don't sing. He's just teasing me. Anand, the day after tomorrow is our wedding anniversary. So come with Bhaskar. - l'lI sureIy. Bhabhi, which fIowers do you Iike? I'll get a Iarge bouquet. You shalI not come. - Why? We don't accept gifts. - Do you accept cash? We are not having a party. We're just inviting you. Don't be obliged. I won't be but you'II have to. There should be variety of food that.. ..my stomach wiIl not be empty. No problem, I'II pack bags of it for you. Very good. But on one condition. - What? You'II have to sing a song now. I know you sing weII. - How do you know? The same old astroIogy. - You mean face reading? Yes. - Yes, l'm her astroIoger. I told her. Come on sing now. Anand, pIease sing.

Mrs. D'sa? She's already come. - Then l'm dead. Why? What happened? - Nothing, come soon. Hey, fatso. Murarilal, how come you're here? Are you fine? Didn't you recognise me? l'm Anand. We had beer at the Qutub Minar and we were drunk. How's your jaggery business doing? I'm not MurariIal nor do l seIl jaggery. My name is Chandranath and I sell oil. So you've started to seII oil. - l haven't. It's an ancestraI business. So what, MurariIal? Any business is equally good. I told you my name is Chandranath. What's in a name? If your name was something else, wouId you change? You'd not, you'd do the same business and meet me. come on, shake hands. I'm gIad to meet you. Are you? So Mr. Chandranath, what's new? There's a new compIication. A shifting pain. Shifting pain. I had it too. There's no better doctor. I first had it here and.. It shifted up and went out from my head. Where do you have it? - ln my knees. I'll take a Iong time. ProbIems. Doctor, is there no medicine which.. ..wilI shift it out from the feet? Yes, doctor, give me such a medicine. It's aIright, go to the office and take an admission. Fine, l'll do it. - Don't worry, Murarilal. My name is not MurarilaI! It's chandranath. Anand, do you want to stop my business? Why were you teasing him? Teasing him? No! I was praising you. May I come in, sir? - Matron! Oh, my God! come in, Mrs. D'sa. Sir, Dr. Baneriee is waiting for you. Fine. What are you doing here? - l was praying. Where did you run away? - Home. Home? - Dr. Banerjee's house. Why didn't you teII me? - l was scared. Do you know Dr. KuIkarni scolded me because of you? So what? You're scolding me too. You talk too much. - Yes, l do. That's why I ran away. I can't survive without taIking and.. ..you told me to lie down quietly. Am I strict for my weIl being? I have to take care of kids like you. Doesn't a mother scold her children? Yes, I reaIised that Iater. Why does everyone call you sister? They shouId caII you Mother. Mother Matron. You'II listen to this mother. Yes, we're friends now, mother. - Then come to the cabin. No, not to the cabin. I'll perish there alone. Take me to your house. I'll tie you up. No one can tie me up, mummy. I'll go away on my own. Good morning, Mrs. D'sa. - Good morning, doctor. Will Anand stay with you? Yes. He doesn't like your nursing home. Wherever he stays, he wins over people. He was just saying, why do people call you sister? They shouId caII you Mother Matron. He's right. Dr. Baneriee, what has happened to him? He.. Lymphocercoma of the intestine. Oh! Is it in the first stage? Will he be alright? No, sister, he's in the last stage. God bless you. Let God bIess you with enough children. Naughty. Who? Me or God? - Aren't you ashamed? What did l say? When one grows up, there'll be a young one.. And when he does there'Il be another one.. -Keep quiet. You utter anything. You're making fun of God. - Even today you both are arguing? Mrs. D'sa - Please come in. You didn't invite me. But how can I forget your anniversary? Your favourite fIowers. No, I'Il give it to both of you together, Sir. You're very partial, Mrs. D'sa you call me sir... And her your daughter. I won't caII you Sir today. I'll pray to God for your happiness. God bless you, dear. come. - No. Bow your head first or eIse you'II say l'm partiaI. Now get ready. Why shouId I? Only Anand and Bhaskar wiII be here. Is Anand coming too? - Yes. I'll be leaving then. - Why? From the time I've heard of his disease, l can't face him. What's wrong with him? - Nothing, he'II be aIright. I'll be leaving, sir. - Sir again? Oh, I shaII Ieave, dear. Please have some sweets. - l've to go to the church. Don't you know I don't eat unless l light the candles. Fine, l shaII be Ieaving. Listen.. What's wrong with Anand? He's sick, he'II be fine. Then why was Mrs. D'sa scared to face him? She's like that, a littIe sentimental. She's scared of every patient. - Mrs. D'sa is a strict matron. I'm sure it's serious, that's why you're hiding. Look l... The priest has not yet finished his chanting.. And the bride is besides the groom. Tell me one thing, what treatment is he giving you? What's wrong with you? - A normaI cold. Tell me the truth, don't joke. That's the problem. l toId you the Hindi term for it.. But if l say in medicaI terms Iike Lymphocercoma of the nose.. ..you'Il beIieve me. - You're Iying. I'm not your brother. You're my sister-in-Iaw. I'm not. I'm your sister and you're my brother. Fine. Henceforth I shall call you by your name Suman. Enough, brother-in-Iaw, be seated. What's wrong with you aII of a sudden? He's standing from such a long time. Sit. Aren't you ashamed? How will he feeI? Suman, he's right. You're my sister and he's my brother-in-Iaw.. Let him caII me that. Bhaskar, I know you won't lie. Tell me the truth. What's wrong with Anand? Why're you asking him? Doctors know nothing. Don't worry about me. An astrologer told me I'll survive till 80. I've not been interviewed as yet. So you beIieve in astroIogers and Sadhus too. Why not? - WiII you come with me? I've a tutor, he's a famous sadhu. Mouni Baba he doesn't talk. Oh, God, I'm dead. Doesn't he ever taIk? No, I've sent many peopIe to him. So nowadays aII your patients go to him? No wonder he was compIaining that his business is not good. Don't joke, wiII you come? - Sure. Your teacher is mine too. 'Prasad'. Pray for us. Do you have to tell us. I always pray for you. I have calIed you my brother, so let me take your bIessings. Bless me. I'll prepare some tea for you. What can l bless you with? I can't even request God to give my Iife to you.

Hey, Babumushai.. when did you come? Did you hear my song quietly? - Yes. Did you like it? - BeautifuI, but a littIe sad. Isn't melanchoIy beautiful, Babumushai? Yes, but I've aIways seen you smiling that's why.. Does that mean every smile is fuII ofjoy? Sometimes sorrow is also.. Anand, you always share yourjoy with others.. Share your sorrows with me today. No, Babumushai, I'll never share it with anyone. Forgive me, I'm selfish in this matter. Anand suddenIy stopped while telling me something.. He hid his sorrows from me. Maybe that sorrow is the essence of his Iife today.. Otherwise how is it possible for a man.. ..who is deteriorating day by day, to have such a stabIe mind? I don't know what he's sad about, but I didn't pry.. But if it's this power which keeps him alive.. Then Iet his pains be conceaIed forever. Take his bIessings. Baba, he's my brother. He's sick. Make him welI. Wait, Suman. You're getting your work done. Let me taIk to Baba first. - How can you talk to him? Didn't I teIl you he doesn't? He's vowed not to. You had. But, Baba.. Have you taken a life-long oath? Won't you ever speak? I'm dead. l'll never be abIe to talk to you. Tell me, Baba, doesn't it troubIe you to remain quiet? I'll die if I stay quiet for five minutes. Don't waste his time. Baba, bless my brother. I'm sure, if you wish he'lI become aIright. can he do that? - Yes, he can. Baba, can't you do something that I can Iive for 200 years..? And as long as l live no disease should affect me. I shouldn't faII sick.. And the thermometer of aII my doctor.. ..friends shouId stand stiII. What does that mean? - What is dying is my body. Baba, then why should I ask you for such a smaII thing? The thing that is dying is my body. Bless my mind so that I'II smile and make others smile too. Baba, bless me so that I should taIk as much as I can.. Let me taIk good about others and not bad even by mistake. Will it be so, Baba? Why don't you leave the onions aIone? Why are you after it.. I'm not. It's after me. It had made me cry. Why did you come into the kitchen? I'II do it. Go to your room. - You can push me out now.. But you won't be able to when she comes and takes over.. That day is not in my fate. I'm not taIking about you, Raghu uncIe, I'm taIking of Munna. I was saying the same. can I get married at this age? Why don't you get him married? - But he shouId agree. Find a good girI for him. I'll coerce him. He won't Iisten. A nice lady used to come here, she no longer does. Who was she? She was nice and I think Munna liked her too. But you know how he is. Tell me, wiII any girl propose to a man? Never. - Set a wedding date.. Bring a priest aIong and catch Munna and get him married. Will it ever happen? - No, never. Munna doesn't understand. He's doing social service.. And is never bothered about himself. Babumushai, what are you doing alone? come, Iet's go out. But where? - Anywhere, come let's go. come. No one can argue with you. But not by your car. - Then? From here to Victoria Terminus and terminus to Victoria. That means a horse carriage. - Why? A Victoria has its own grandeur.. It feeIs like the ancient rich are arriving Iike some.. ..Lucknowi Raibahadur Murarikhan Sharif. come, Babumushai, Iet's go. You'II have to wait for the bus for an hour. So what, Babumushai? Murarilal. Hey, Murarilal.. - What? Didn't you recognise me? We had beer at Qutub Minar and we were drunk.. You're mistaken. I've never been to Delhi. Your memory is very weak. I'm teIling the truth. My name is not MurarilaI, but Jagdish. I have a friend named Murarilal and he resembIes you.. So what? l've met another Murarilal on this pretext.. Shake hands, I'm gIad to meet you. Aren't you.. Yes. - Don't forget me. Go now. Bye. Anand, you should have seen whether he was MurarilaI or not. I don't know anyone by the name of MurariIaI.. So what? l felt Iike meeting him and I met him. Do you ever feeI that you don't know a person.. ..who has helped you and yet you never Iiked him? Yes. At times you may.. ..meet a person who has never helped you but yet you Iike him. Yes, but why? - Yes, telI me why. Because he.. I'll teII you. Every human body is a transmitter and a receiver. There was a vibration from Jagdish's body and l received it. That's it. It's a great theory, Babumushai.. If you do research, you'II win a Noble priZe. What's this craZiness? - Babumushai, you call this craZy. You meet a man, make friends and touch him.. What else do you need? Look.. there's one more Murarilal. Where are you going? Stand here. - Babumushai, Murarilal.. Sir, pIease buy fIowers for your wife. Babumushai, shall I buy them for my sister-in-law? Yes, Iet us. - Give me two fragrant ones. I get them from the gardens, sir. - What, garlands? Yes. No, fIowers. - Say that. Here. Hey Babumushai. You are very smart. - What? I mean Mr. smart. If l hadn't bought these flowers, you'd never teII me. Tell me who is she? Where does she live? Whom are you talking about? I thought it was for Suman. Don't avoid it. TelI me where does she Iive and who is she? Whom are you talking about? - The girl with whom.. ..you've your continuity.. - Continuity! What continuity? In Hindi, it's Love and in Bengali too. I'm not in Iove. can't you telI me. Ladies and Gentleman. There are young men who.. Know nothing about love. - Anand! What are you doing?! - Then teII me. There's nothing to reveaI. - Lies again. Ladies and Gentleman.. - You're bIackmailing me. You'II have to tell me. What should I tell? - Who is she? There must be someone who makes your heart beat. Babumushai, your eyes reveaI that there is someone. Babumushai, teIl me please. You know that l.. She was my patient and was suffering from pneumonia.. WhiIe giving her treatment I.. I understand. What's her name? - Renu. Where does she live? - She teaches in a schooI. Did you kiss her? - What?! Did you ever kiss her? - Naughty. What are you shy about? - Anand, don't be siIly. This is strange Bengali Iove. Love shouId be Iike that. Who is it? Greetings! Is the doctor in? - Yes, he is. can you caIl him? - l wiII, surely. Please be seated. Sit. Tell me what's your probIem. Don't be worried. Our doctor is a magician. The moment he touches you the patient get's up.. ..and starts playing cricket. But you're a girl, you'II play badminton. You're laughing. I'm telling you the truth. You won't find a doctor Iike him. Anand, whom are you taIking to? Renu! You here? - l'm dead. What dead? Renu, he's my best friend, Anand. Babumushai, isn't she that continuity one. - Anand. For whom your heart beats and you spend sleepIess nights? Anand! What's going on? - No, you didn't teII me.. but.. Renuji, you teach at a schooI. - Yes. You suffered from pneumonia. - Yes. And he cured you? - Yes. How do I know? He toId me everything. He's very shy and timid. - Anand. Sorry, l can't caIl her my sister-in-law as yet. But why are you yeIIing at me? You're in Iove with the girl and can't you teIl her. Will you pIease shut up? - Oh! Yes. Yes. Yes. When SaIim and Anarkali are quiet about it.. Mughal-E-AZam is doing the talking. But Renuji, l'm telIing the truth. He's in love with you. I'm Ieaving now. I hope you didn't beIieve Anand. No. Why didn't you, he spoke the truth. What l couIdn't reveal so Iong my friend has done so. But Renu if these feelings are not reciprocal, teIl me.. So I won't be embarrassed later. You're friend was right, you're reaIIy timid. That's it. Everything was perfect. Now that Anand has broken the barriers.. I feeI Iike reveaIing aII that has pent up in my heart. Then do so. Let's go out. ShaII we? Are you going somewhere? Yes, Anand, we were going for a walk. WilI you join us? What are you gaping for? Will you join us? Yes, I'll come. Let me get my coat. Why did you caIl him? - l was being courteous. Idiot! He agreed immediately. No problem, we'll Ieave. Why do I need a coat? come, Babumushai.. let's go. Did you notice the colour of the water? It looks like the evening sun has meIted and.. Hell! l feeI as though a smaII boy has fallen down.. ..and hurt his nose and is bleeding profuseIy. You fool, if you love the girl, hoId her hand.. And propose to her. Why show her the sea and the sky? Timid. Hypocrite. I hate you. I hate you. l hate you. I've never seen this friend of yours before. He came a month ago from Delhi for treatment. What happened? - lt's a fatal disease. Do you know he won't survive for more than 2 to 3 months? Unless God shows some miracIe. You never believed in God. I feeI Iike believing in Him. I don't mind beIieving in anyone just for Anand's sake. He's so jovial. Please don't teIl him. He knows. He knows everything. And yet.. No wonder even the Gods can't Iive without him. "Life is a riddIe." "It makes us Iaugh and cry at times." "Life is a riddIe." "It makes us Iaugh and cry at times." "Even then this mind does not Iearn." "It runs after the dreams." "Even then this mind does not Iearn." "It runs after the dreams." "One day the person.." "..himseIf goes away far beyond the dreams." "Life is a riddIe." "It makes us Iaugh and cry at times." "Those who Iived here.." "..have experienced both, the happiness and sorrows." "Those who Iived here.." "..have experienced both, the happiness and sorrows." "Finally choosing the siIence.." "..they Ieave somewhere alone." "Life is a riddIe." "It makes us Iaugh and cry at times." "Life..." come, Bhaskar. So early in the morning? Didn't Anand come along. - No. He's gone to the poIice station. - PoIice station? Why? He was going somewhere when l asked, he repIied.. I'm going to the poIice station to get a warrant against you. He was just joking. I told him many a times not to go out alone.. You never tell me anything about Anand. What's happened to him? Get an extra cup for Bhaskar first. Be seated. Prakash, I've some bad news. - Why, what happened? We'II have to inform Trivedi soon. Anand wiII not be abIe to move around for Iong. Suman. What's this? Will you treat him with just tea? What wouId you like to have? - Oh! Do you have to ask him? The cake that we got yesterday.. Will you cut it next year on your birthday? You're aIways after me. Trivedi had caIIed up from Delhi yesterday. Anand has written a Iong Ietter to him. He's written that unIess he fixes up your wedding.. And finishes his work.. Unless he compIetes his work he will not return to DeIhi but.. Not go anywhere eIse. Prakash, one thing puZZIes me. How can his relatives Iive without him? I wouIdn't be able to stay without him for a day. Anand doesn't have anyone, Bhaskar. What do you mean by no one? There must be some relative. No, he's an orphan who came to Delhi during the partition.. He lived with his relatives for sometime. When he started earning, he ran away. His reIatives aIways thought he was trying to run away. He loves Suman a lot, he toId her everything. He aIso said, wish one could choose friends.. As one could his reIatives. He aIso said that after meeting us.. He has started believing in Iong Iasting reIationships. Trust me, as much as we worry about him.. The more he worries about us. - l know Prakash. I also know that this Iove is his strength. That's why he can survive. If it was someone eIse he'd been bed-ridden by now. Sometimes l feeI scared that the remaining few months.. ..wilI end for Anand very soon. When l leave him aIone in the mornings.. ..l feeI worried whether I'II see him aIive in the evening. Excuse me. A schooI teacher named Renu lives here. can you teIl me the number of her house? Renu.. The one with the long pIaits. - And round vermilIion on her forehead.. The one with the dimpled smiIe? - Yes. Do you want to know her house number? First Iet us know your number. - What? First Iet us know your number. - What do you mean? Everyone has a number here. The first is of a tall guy who doesn't live here.. But drops her home sometimes. The second is mine and the third is his. We aII have a number here. If you want to woo her, join the gang. Yes. Now tell me the number of her house. Twenty five. - Twenty five. Thank you. What's your number? - Number ten. Let him come back. We'II give him a number. Mother. You're great. You recognised me as soon as you saw me. You're Renu's mother. - Yes. God bless you. Excuse me, but I didn't recognise you. You don't know me but Renu does. I've come for her. She's going to be Iate today. - That's why I've come so earIy. Don't sit there. - So what? You join me too. I've an important work with you. - What work? What was earlier done by eIders is.. ..being fuIfilled by a brother. I don't understand. - l've got a proposaI for Renu. I want to make her my sister-in-law. - Oh. What can l say? Renu will decide about it. Times have changed.. Girls no longer agree comely to their parents and marry. These days unIess a boy and girl meet each other.. I know, Aunty. I know everything. The girl and boy have already met.. And I've seen them Iooking at each other. That's why l've come to you. Raghu Kaka and I have approved the girl. If you want to meet the boy, you can do so. He's a doctor and when Bhabi.. I mean the girI suffered from pneumonia, he treated her. Who Bhaskar? - Yes, he's my brother. Is it true? l am so fortunate. Bhaskar is a gem of a person. Renu keeps on praising him. That's it. lt's fixed then. Sorry, mummy. l mean you must have understood by now. I do. lf they have agreed, it's good. But.. Because you're his brother I've have to tell you.. I don't have anything to give to my daughter in marriage. Why're you worried about it? What do you think the groom can give.. aspirin or penicillin? So the alIiance is finalised. Everything is ready. Get me the horoscope. We'II finaIise the date in a week. But we can't do anything for three months. Three months. Why? Renu's father expired nine months ago and so.. Then it's difficult. I won't be abIe to attend the marriage. Why? Are you going somewhere? Yes, I'll be leaving after one and a half months. Where are you going? - Far away. can't you come back for the wedding? No, it's difficuIt and there's a Iot of rush. We don't get a return ticket from there. But you can start preparing for the wedding. I'll be leaving now. I have a lot of work to do. Have some sweets. - No, l don't want to. I'll be back after two days and you'II have treat me to lunch. You will, won't you? You got this proposal for Renu.. I'm so glad.. But at the same time I feeI frightened. I have onIy one daughter. How will I survive aIone? But now I feel my daughter's a stranger and you're my son. I hope God gives you a Iong Iife. Hey, you disrupted our queue and went away. couIdn't help it. It was an emergency. We'II have to teach him a lesson aIong with the taIl one. We'II cripple the girI. Neither wiII she go out.. ..nor will anyone come here. - l understand You seem to be sensible. Hope you won't take the troubIe of coming back. What are you saying? I'II have to. There are strong vibrations. So shall we be meeting again? Not only meeting but beating too. What did he mean? That means kicking. - He's threatening us. What's the problem? HeIIo. - HeIIo. What do you want? - Dust. I want a IittIe dust. This is a wrestIers' arena, you don't get dust here. I want the dust of your feet. You're the epitome of strength. I want to be at your feet. Long Iive. If you want to build your body, discard your cIothes. You'II have to pay me my fees. - No, papaji ..l don't want to train under you.. I saw your strength and asked for the dust of your feet. Look at me, l'm so useless. Neither can l save myseIf nor my famiIy. What happened? Who's troubling you? There are a few men down the street.. ..who trouble my sister-in-law everyday. I mean, I can't come freeIy to my.. ..wouId-be sister-in-Iaw's house. - Jeetu, I'II be back soon. come, let's see who's troubling you. I'II.. Yes, pIease come. Papaji, there they are. No.. Let me go first. When they come to hit me, you arrive. Papa, please come soon or they'II make a pulp out of me. Are you scared of them? Go now. ShaII l.. - Yes, go on. Here he comes again. - Hey mister.. Whom have you come to fight with? With us or your JuIiet? First Iet us rehearse.. you'II find it easier Iater. Yes, Iet us. Papaji! Son of dog. You tease his sister. Do you think we're nothing. Go, run.. Wait. What's this caIIed? - A drain pipe pant. What does it mean? - lt means a dirty drain. Next time l see you wearing it.. ..l'll throw you in the dirty drain. Get Iost. Papaji, you're great. You are truIy very strong. - God bless you, son. God, Iet Anand get well. I beg of you. Suman. Suman. - What happened? You're sitting here talking to God and I'm looking for you. Have these sweets. - Sweets, what for? come here, sit down. My Babumushai has been cured. What happened to him? - A dreadful disease. - Be thankfuI.. ..l noticed the symptoms and searched for the medicine. But before l could find it, the medicine found the patient. I'm confused. Who found whom? Renu found Babumushai. - Who Renu? Babumushai's medicine. You don't know, Suman. Babumushai treated Renu.. And in the bargain fell sick in Iove. How do you know? - l got it from the horse's mouth. You know him well and yet you don't. I found out about it. You're not bothered about anyone. Don't pray for yourself. Pray for others too. But today l asked God something especiaIIy for me. What? What did you ask for? Oh, I know. ShaIl I buy toys? I'm his uncle. What wilI my nephew say? What did you pray for? My nephew or a niece? Don't feeI shy. Tell me what did you ask for? I prayed for my brother's Iife. That rogue toId you everything. Suman.. Suman. Look at me. Look at me. You are my sister, yet you're weeping. You're so weak. You pray to God everyday.. Is this the strength that He has given you? Are you weeping in the fear that I'Il leave you? I'm aIive today, aren't you happy? can't you smile? Renu, come in. Please be seated. Where did you Iearn that? From a body builder friend. He's very strong. Hey, Babumushai. - l've come to meet you. Me? - Yes. Not your friend. Speak softIy or he'lI be green with envy. Renu. - TaIk of the devil and he appears. When did you come? - No, Babumushai, go back. Wrong number. She's come to meet me. Tell him. Yes, I've come to meet you. - Correct. He's jealous. MuraIilal. You talk to her. I'll go meet MurariIaI. Oh, MurariIal. Who's this MurariIaI? - Watch. Hey, Murarilal how come you're here? What's this beard for Iike King Shahjahan? Didn't you recognise me? We had beer at Qutub Minar and we were drunk? Jaichand. You're too much. You Ieft Delhi after those two pegs. -They were not two but four. You bet. They were two pegs but Iarge. come, let's go again. - l've stopped drinking. How about you? - No, l didn't. It's a habit now. Babumushai, come here. Are you married or still single? No, I'm not. The girI l approve, my father disapproves. He says she's too young. And the girl he approves I disapprove because she's oId. Tell me about your girlfriend. She was of medium height. What happened, Anand? - Babumushai. Didn't I tell you.. ..l'd meet Murarilal someday? I've found him. Murarilal, this is Dr. Bhaskar I Iive with him. Greetings! - Greetings! Jaichand and I are childhood friends. He was aIways naughty. His name is not Jaichand but Anand. My name is not Murarilal but Issa Bhai. Issa Bhai Suratwala. Remember me? I hope your name is Bhaskar. - Yes. Teacher, where are you going? I was Iooking for you. You were splendid. Let's have tea. I can't. I've my rehearsaIs today. - RehearsaIs? Yes, I own a drama company. - You hoId shows. Yes. - Give me a role. I can act a Iittle too. I've seen your acting just now. Let's go. Babumushai, take care of her. I'm going to the drama company. Let's go, master. - Yes. ShaII l leave? - Did you really come to meet Anand? Yes, I had planned to meet him too. You met him. What about me? Sit with me for sometime. - Don't you have to go to work? It's a half hourjob. I'll do it anytime. No, finish your work. I'll wait for you here. Hello, Panditji. Please be seated. ShaII we rehearse? - Yes, we shall. But the mood is not created like this. It's an Urdu drama, wear your costumes. Rajni, are you ready? - Yes, l am. Very good. Play the tape. Where's my turban? Your ExceIIency. - l'm ashamed.. ..in spite of being a prince.. You are in Iove with an ordinary girI. Father, if she's ordinary.. come a littIe further. If you can tell me someone better than her.. I can, but l can't give the permission to go there.. Because I... I understand, father Shekhu! - Father. I'm ashamed to have given birth to a son Iike you. It's every man's duty to be ashamed of his errors. Quiet, you fooI. I'll bury you aIive. You bet. You can bury me but not keep me alive. Why didn't you die the day you were born? Life and death is in the hands of God, Your ExceIIency. Neither can you change it nor l. We are just puppets on a string.. And the strings are pulled by Him. When, who and how it can be pulled one can never telI. Splendid! You were great. Fine, now Iet's have a tea break. How did you like it? - Wonderful. Who? - What who? What did you mean? I asked you about the rehearsaI. Your rehearsal was good but the girI is pretty. Which one? - The one with the knife. Oh, Rajni. - She must be your sister. ShaII l introduce you? - Yes. WelI. Rajni, come here for a moment. He's Anand, a good actor from Delhi. He wants to taIk to you. Hello! - HeIIo! Which plays have you performed in Delhi? I'm dead. l don't act, I only sing. What are you saying? Don't you speak Gujarati? What can l talk to him. You're right. - You don't know Hindi, he doesn't know Gujarati. Then no use of it. Go! Go! I have faiIed with the language. Yes, you have. "I can't concentrate.." "I can't concentrate anywhere in your absence." "I can't concentrate.." "I can't concentrate anywhere in your absence." "I can't concentrate.." "I don't remember when I had forgotten to live." "Moment l obtained you, I'm reIived." "I don't remember when I had forgotten to Iive." "Moment l obtained you, I'm reIived." "Life.." "I don't Iike to live without you." "I can't concentrate.." "I can't concentrate anywhere in your absence." "I can't concentrate.." "BeIoved, this fan of yours can't controI herseIf." "I can't concentrate.." "BeIoved, this fan of yours can't controI herseIf." "Whenever you need to go out somewhere." "TeII the time to haIt right there." "Whenever you need to go out somewhere." "TeII the time to haIt right there." "That moment.." "That moment must stay there and shouId not pass away." "I can't concentrate.." "I can't concentrate anywhere in your absence." "I can't concentrate.." Raghu uncIe, where's Renu? - Upstairs. Renu. You've come now. I've been waiting for hours. What can l do? A doctor's profession is Iike this. Does Anand like to record? Yes. He loves to talk. When he's tired, he starts the tape. The entire day? l mean, Renu was waiting for you. What happened. Why're you breathIess? Nothing, Babumushai. I found a girl for you.. And today l went in search of a girI for myseIf. Did you find anyone? - Yes, l did. But failed in the language. - Why? What happened? She was a Gujarati girl and knows no other Ianguage. Yet I haven't Iost hopes. I've bought four Gujarati books. Won't I be abIe to Iearn Gujarati within a year? I know. If not now at Ieast in the next life. I'll carry a handycam with me. In my next Iife.. ..l'll fall in Iove at the age of 10. Are you going out? - Yes, but you are not coming. Did you hear? A timid guy is scolding me. No problem. Anand, you've received Trivedi's Ietter. Read it. I won't leave even if Trivedi or Indira Gandhi invites me. There's no place like Bombay. Punjab, Sind, Gujarat, Maratha, Dravid, everyone settIes here. I have decided that I'll live and die in Bombay. Anand was breathless while talking today. These are his last signs. In the medical profession there's a.. ..stage when no treatment heIps.. And the doctor has to wait for the patient's death. No one can perceive this helpIess situation except a doctor. Oh, God! Such frightening heIplessness. I won't let you go so quietly, mummy. What were you murmuring siIently? I was praying to God. - What did you ask Him for? I asked Jesus for your.. I'm dead. What have you done? - Why, what happened? Don't you know, I'm a disciple of Lord Shiva.. ..and you prayed to Jesus. What if they fight with each other? You fool. - Mummy, you don't know.. Shivji is very short-tempered. It's aIright. God has not seen my temper. If they interfere.. ..l'll be born as your son in my next Iife. What's your opinion? Good, you're here. You'II be the witness. I've made a contract with mummy.. ..l'll be born to her in my next Iife. He's fooIish. He just blabbers. Aren't you my son now? Why wait for the next birth? Yes, it's true. So he doesn't move around.. - Yes. I've seen so many deaths but I won't be abIe to bear this one. We are trying our level best. What are we doing? Man has reached the moon.. We have even accomplished on outer space but.. What have we done to fight against human diseases.. ..pain and torment? Nothing! Sometimes I feeI so heIpless, Prakash. Won't you go and see Anand? Go and meet him once. He won't survive for long. No, Bhaskar, I don't have the courage. I don't have the courage. I'll be leaving now. I have to go to the church. You sit here and taIk to him. I'II come again. It's not nice to make others cry? - Why? I wanted Mummy to Iaugh and she cried. I try to make everyone Iaugh but they all cry. You don't understand. When there's too much joy.. Tears flow from our eyes. Your mummy didn't weep because she was sad.. ..but because she was happy. Where wiII she find a son Iike you? Yes. You are right. And where wiII you find a brother Iike me? See what I've got for you. Wait here. l'll go get it. Anand, you.. You are crazy.. Don't scoId me in BengaIi. I'm not. I said you're craZy. Why did you remove the fIower from my hair? I'll preserve it in my poetry book. - Why? As poetry reminds us of yesteryears.. ..in the same manner this fIower wiII be my poetry. I told you you're craZy. - l am and l'm craZy about you. Sometimes l feeI that if l envelope you in my arms.. ..you will melt and become one with me. You'II remain in my arms forever. When l breathe, l should hear your breath within me.. And you'II caII me by my name Anand.. Anand.. Who is she? - Who? This girl. - She's my Bengali girl friend. You're smart. You asked your brother to tell you everything.. ..and hid your own matters. Who is she. What's her name? Name? What wilI you do by knowing it? Where does she live? In DeIhi. - But where in Delhi? In here husband's house. Oh, so she's married. No, she was not when we met. He's a nice man, her husband. He loves her very much. She'II be happy. If she'd married me, she'd be dead. Do you know we used to find very.. ..IittIe time to meet each other? That's why l used to tape her voice on the sIy when we met. And after she Ieft I wouId hear it all over again and again. When did she get married? Three months and seven days ago. When did you come from DeIhi - l.. ExactIy three months and seven days ago. Forget it. Why go into these detaiIs now? Look, what l've got for you. Did you like it? ShaII l teII you something? Wear it when I'm stiIl alive. Hey, Babumushai, what are you doing here aIl aIone? Oh! You're thinking of her. Love is such. You faII in Iove and Iove troubIes you.. Anand, leave me alone for sometime. If l leave you aIone now, there'll be probIems. Let's go to the other room and record your voice. Anand, pIease go to your room. I wilI, but l'll take you aIong. I told you l want to be aIone. - And l don't want you to be alone. Anand.. Why are you after me? Why do you expect me to do aIl that you teII me to? You Iaugh and expect me to Iaugh.. I'm sorry, Babumushai. Anand, don't feel hurt. You know l.. - Babumushai.. ..how many times wiII you remind me that my days are nearing.. My end is here. Babumushai, no one has faced death. But I'm so unfortunate that everyday and every moment, every second.. On your face.. In your eyes.. No, Babumushai, I can face death.. But can't bear to see your frightened face. I'll go away. I'II leave tomorrow. No, Anand, you won't go anywhere. You don't have anyone.. If you ever die, you'II die here in my arms. That's the spirit. Do you know my problem? Our spirit ofjoy is aIways dampened with meIanchoIy.. And it poisons our cheerfulness. Babumushai, I'm not going to die today. And even if I die.. ..l won't Ieave you aIone. I'll aIways remain here. Yes, Anand, I know you're a part of me.. A part of my life. But I'll miss one thing. - What? Your voice, this chatter. - Then let's record this chatter. But first we'lI record your poem. - Which one? The one you had written in your college days. Oh, death! ls a poem.. Let's go. come. Death is a poem.. Yet I've promised this poem that someday l'll meet.. When sleep overcomes even the painfuI sinking nerves.. The yellow moon rises slowIy in the sky.. When the sun sets at twiIight and.. ..the night is on the horizon.. It's neither dark nor bright nor night or day.. When our body no Ionger lives and the soul starts breathing.. I've promised this poem that someday I'Il meet.. Now you say something. - What? Anything, but you'II have to taIk for my sake. Yes, that's right. Babumushai.. Life and death is in the hands of God ExceIlency. Neither can you change it nor l. We are just puppets on a stage. Whose strings are pulled by Him. When, how and who wiII go one can never teII.. Anand.. Anand, sit down. Munna. - Yes, Raghu uncle? can you Iend me Rs.50? - Yes, it's in the drawer upstairs. I need four to five days Ieave. Leave? You're taking Ieave. You know Anand's condition.. I'm taking it for him. I want to go to my viIlage. There's a tempIe of a Goddess who is very powerfuI. I'll get her blessings for him. I've seen the dead come back to Iife. Go soon, Raghu uncIe. There's very littIe time left. I'll leave by the 1 1 .00 clock train.. ..and return after two days. Don't worry, Munna, Anand wiII be aIright. Jaichand. come, lssa Bhai. Greetings. Where's he? - Please be seated. I don't have the time. There are final rehearsals today. I've a lot of work to do. Please caII Jaichand quickIy. He won't be abIe to come. - You bet. He will surely come. You just teIl him that Rajni Bahen.. That Rajni's rehearsals are there and.. ..he'II come taIking in Gujarati. The probIem is that.. Okay, Munna. - You're Ieaving. come back soon. As soon as possible. This medicine can cure poison.. ..fever, choIera, cancer or any other disease. No, Raghu uncIe. Any disease can be cured but not cancer. It can be. Even that can be cured. You bet. - Yes, l wiII. You'II lose. l've never lost a bet. My father was a famous doctor too.. He aIways said that one who gets this dreaded disease.. ..wilI sureIy die. - lt's not a doctor's medicine. Which medicine is this? - lt's called beIief. I'Il leave now. I'm sure his cancer will be cured. But who's got cancer? Anyone I know? Yes. He's close to me. Who? Anand. That's why l said, he can't come with you. He's in his last stages. I don't know when.. He knew.. didn't he, doctor? Wow! Wow! Even on his death bed.. ..the student taught the teacher about life. Keep sorrows to yourseIf and give joy to others. Wow! Wow! Doctor.. can I meet him just once? Yes. PIease come. Anand. Gurudev. - You're taking an early exit. Very smart. You've taken the cIaps.. And Ieft the empty chairs for us. What can l do? My dialogues are alI over.. Or eIse l'd have chaIIenged you. You bet. But we'll meet up there. Set your Anand troupe and your own drama. I'll join you. If you need any actress from here inform me.. I'll get her along. I need one. But not now. I'll have to learn Gujrati first I'll leave now. I'll come again. Where? - Here. l'II meet you here. I won't let the curtain faII. Issa Bhai. Doctor.. I hope Raghu uncle wins the bet. Thus these are a few pages left in Anand's life.. Like his last few days. Renu was right. God needs good peopIe as much as we do. No one can go against His wishes. Sometimes they say a prayer creates miracles.. And at this moment l know everyone must be doing just that. But aII of us know the cIimax. And we are waiting in anxiety. When..? No.. Anand, take oxygen.. you'II feeI better. Babumushai, open aIl the windows. Prakash, I'm going to Dr. Shastri.. I've heard that there's a medicine in homeopathy.. ..that can create miracles at times. - Don't be a fool. Don't you reaIise nothing can be done. How do you know nothing wiII heIp? Haven't miracIes happened before? Babumushai.. - Anand, I'll come back soon. Don't go anywhere, Babumushai. Don't worry. I'Il be back soon. Renu, l don't want to die. Try and save me. He's very weak. He won't be able to bear my death. - Brother, Anand! He won't be abIe to bear my death. Brother, Anand! Brother, Anand! Has Babumushai returned? - He'II come soon. He'II come soon. Has Babumushai returned? Babumushai! Friend. - Yes, Anand? Friend, start the tape quickly. Friend, start the tape quickly. Sister. Death is a poem.. Yet I have promised this poem that someday l'll meet.. When sleep overcomes even the painfuI sinking nerves.. The yellow moon rises slowIy in the sky.. When the sun sets at twiIight and.. ..the night is on the horizon.. It's neither dark nor bright not night or day.. When our body no Ionger lives.. - Babumushai ! Prakash, Dr. Shastri.. No, I won't let you be siIent Iike this.. I've been Iistening to your chatter for the Iast six months.. You've chewed my brains. Talk to me now. TaIk to me.. Talk to me.. Babumushai! Life and death is in the hands of God, ExceIIency.. Neither can you change it nor l. We are puppets on a stage whose strings are puIled by Him. When how and who wilI go no one can predict..
