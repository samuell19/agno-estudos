Sam. It's looking terribly ugly. The me...the men are getting edgy. Yeah, so am I. Come on, Joe! Make it snappy, will ya! Come on, let's get out of here. Wait a minute, Sam. There's thousands of dollars worth of stuff in that old rust bucket. I'm not gettin' out of here without it. Are you kiddin'? Stop worrying. Let's take it out and be back up in 10 minutes. He's been down half an hour. I know these waters well, Sam. I've never seen the like of this before. Get me a lung, I'm going down to get him. He's come up! Prepare sea anchor! Secure forward derrick! Steady, men! I got you! Not as bad as I thought, Joe. How long to get her into shape? The rudder stock's bent, a couple of sprung plates. - Uh-huh. - That mess on deck. Three, four days. And we're out of fresh water. Let's go ashore and see what they've got. Eh, Sam? Look there. I've never seen anything like that before. The whole ocean bottom must've been torn up. Looks like they were pretty hard hit. Yeah. Hi. Is there a harbor master we can talk to? Gaelic, huh? Doesn't sound like 'welcome' in any language. Hey, kid, is your father at home? I don't have a father. Oh. Does the harbor master live here? It's the right place you've come to, then. Come in. You say the harbor master lives here? Yes, but it's a city man, he is. A government man. Who is he? What's he do? 4800:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,927 McCartin's his name. Calls himself an arc... Archaeologist. What's your name? Sean. I work for him. Doing what? Well, bits o' this, and bits o' that. Cleanin' up the things he finds. What things? You want to see them, then? Yeah, sure. Well, what do you know? That's been under the sea for a thousand years, they say. Viking, looks like. Yeah? That's it. There was a great sea battle right off the bay here. And we Irish drove them off and sank their ships. What's that? That's Ogra. The sea spirit. Just grand wreck he did that day. Sounds like St. Patrick and the snakes. What are you doing here? You get out. I'm Joe Ryan. And my partner, Sam Slade. How are you? McCartin's the name. Salvage vessel, aren't you? Yeah. I thought so. Did the boy tell you about all this? Yeah, a little. This stuff has no real value except to us eggheads. But since it turned up, no ships allowed at Nara Island for more than 24 hours without a permit. Look, friend, we're not seaworthy. We won't be for 3 or 4 days. I don't make the orders. That's the way it is. Anyway, we're afloat. Come on, Sam. Hey, how about fresh water? We'll give you that. Thanks. No hard feelings now. Oh, no. You believe him? About this permit? Nope. Well, something's eating him. I wonder what. I don't know. Come on. Maybe, we'll swing a little more weight around here if we find out. Hey, Joe, look. Stagger off, Harry. Are you having any luck? You know, Joe, they can talk English every bit as good as you and I can. They just don't want to, that's all. You try 'em, Harry. He said there's no time for talkin' with strangers. And McCartin's does all the talkin' on the island. Two of the divers didn't come up, Joe. They think they're gone. Gone? There's one. So that's what's worrying McCartin. He's dead. Dead, how? You saw him come up. If you ask me, he died of fright. This is crazy. There was a man lost down there today, not even a trace. Another one saw something that scared him to death. Look, Sam, you don't wanna go? Don't go. I'm going, all right. Just to make sure that you get back. Sure. With a hat full of gold. Get set. Yeah, okay. What did you see, Sam? I don't know. But whatever it was, I never want to see it again. How goes it, Sam? These are the last few barrels coming on board now. Look, get back, kid. Will ya. McCartin wants to see ya. It's a fine rage he's in. Oh, it is, is it? Look, kid, get down off there, will you? About the permit. What about the permit? It's a heathen lie. Maybe we better see what this joker's got in mind. Where is he? Come on, then. Harry. What's going on here? They think a shark got the man who was lost. Mr. McCartin, I hear you've got a beef. You were snoopin' around out there. My divers told me. Yeah, and I suppose they told you to give us all that jazz about a permit. Are you doubtin' my word? You're right, Mr. McCartin. I am. After you load with water, you leave. Tonight. The sooner, the better. It's Ogra! Shoot! No! No! - No! No! - Let go. Quiet! Quiet! Now, there's a man who looks like he's got a real problem. Uh-huh. And I bet he'd pay through the nose if we could solve it for him. Quiet! Quiet all of you! Will you be quiet now! Hey, Mister! We'll be wanting a passage on your ship just as soon as his nibs here gets around to givin' us our pay. Now, hold on. You'll get your pay if you like. But there'll be no taking a passage on any ship. Why not? Yeah, why not? Hear me out for a minute. Now for God's sake, let's go inside and talk about it. Sure. If they all leave now, my boatmen, my divers, the lot of them, the whole thing will go to smash. Me, I kinda see their point. Got any other reason for not wanting them to leave? What do you mean? Oh, like uh, maybe they talk too much. Where did you get those? Same place as you. Supposing we got rid of that thing for you? The beast? Do you think you can? Maybe. Lets' take a another look in there first, huh? Open the safe. You've done all right for yourself! How about this for a down payment? Do you like this one, Sam? You must be out of your mind. A thing like that's priceless. And how do you think you're going to dispose of it? Oh, you must've figured out a way. I bet we can. - Dirty blackmailer. - Shut up! You're getting off easy, friend. Could've grabbed the lot. When will you start? Now. Why not? Mr. Ryan! Mr. Ryan! What is it, kid? You'll be tryin' to catch him, Ogra? Yeah, maybe. Not afraid, are you? No. But it's a bad thing you're doin'. A terrible bad thing, Mr. Ryan. Why don't you call me Joe? Okay, Joe. Okay, Sean. We might be able to catch him in the nets. Yeah. But how are you supposed to kill a thing like that? Oh, I don't know, uh... dynamite maybe. Ever stop to think what a thing like that might be worth alive? You really think you'll catch him with that? Sure, why not? I figure that the lights will act as a sort of lure. If that doesn't work, we'll try something else. - Okay, Harry, come on. - Okay. Johnny, hut! Ready when you are, Joe. Okay. Take her up! Bring her out! Out! Lower away! Down! Uh, Sam? Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear ya. Uh, give me about 15 fathoms. Down! Sam? Sam? Ten fathoms. How's that? Okay, that'll do. Give me four to five knots. Yeah, slow engine. Head her down the bay. Slow engine! Sam, can you hear me? Stop engines! Stop engines! Send me up, Sam. Not too fast, I don't wanna lose him. Slow up. Up, up. Sam! Sam, pull up! Up! Quick, quick! Pull up! Up! Sam! Sam, pull up! Pull up! Up! Sam! Sam! Pull up! Sam, quick! Sam! Pull up! She won't take anymore! She'll snap the cable! Drop your nets! Drop the nets! Drop the nets! All hands on nets! Hurry up. Winch it on. Take her out. Sam, the nets! Drop it. Drop it! Steady on the winch! Bring her in! Lower away! Tighten up those shackles! The headlines of the entire world are being monopolized by the news of the capture of a fantastic monster seemingly of prehistoric origin off the coast of Ireland. Puzzled scientists are already speculating that the monster may have been released from some vast suboceanic cavern far beneath the Earth's crust by unprecedented volcanic eruptions which occurred in the area last week. Some scientific authorities are suggesting that the whole thing is merely an elaborate Irish hoax. Nevertheless, the Irish government are sending two of their top paleontologists to claim the creature for Ireland if it does exist. There's your friend, Professor. I'll tell my partner you're here. Radio, skipper. Those two professors from Dublin have just come on board. Show 'em up. It's amazing! I wonder if you realize, Captain Ryan, the enormous scientific value of this discovery. I think we do, Professor. Well, then, I shall wireless the University of Dublin once to make preparations to receive the animal. I see. You'll proceed to Dublin and... Oh, you'll be properly compensated for your services. Oh, sure, sure. Well, we'll... We'll meet there. Unless you'd like one of us to go with you. Oh, that won't be necessary, Professor. Oh, there's one thing... The animal skin should be kept wet with a continuous stream of water. I see. This is most important. I'll take care of it. When do you intend sailing, Captain? Tonight, if that's okay by you. Sooner the better. See you in Dublin. University of Dublin. Properly compensated. Big deal. Take a look at this, Sam. It's from Dorkin's Circus in London. They offer 30 thousand against 50 percent of the gross. Set a course for London, Sam. I came to let you go back to the sea. You little nuthead! What do you think you're doing? Hey, take it easy. I came to let him go back to the sea where he belongs. Why? Maybe to save your silly skins for you. I have a guttin' notion to toss you over the side. Will you be sending me back now? - Harry! - Yeah? Better get our little stowaway into a bunk. And wash his face. Harry, put a guard on that thing 24 hours and give him a rifle. Right now, Joe. I could be watchin' him for you now. Yeah, you. You'd be great, wouldn't you? If it so much as moves, start shootin' and then run like the devil. Tell us something, kid. Anyone ever see that thing before? And why should anybody have to see it to know it's there? Go back to sleep, kid. It's just phosphorus, Sam. But it's coming from the scuppers. It's the water off the animal. So, it's still saltwater. You seeing spirits too? The ropes! The ropes! Quick! Come on! Get him ready for burial, Sam. Kid, I told you to stay below. Down! Down! Swing clear! Keep her clear! All right, lower it a bit! A creature unique in evolutionary biology and you turn it into a circus freak. Outrageous! Quite apart from the fact that you stole it! Look, that's a matter of opinion. What's the row about? You know absolutely nothing about this animal. It's extremely dangerous. We've managed to handle it all right so far. It may carry disease-bearing parasites, or unknown bacteria. And you bring it into the heart of a great city. Look, what do you want? First, the opportunity to make a complete study. Okay. If it doesn't interfere with business. Believe me, gentlemen, once the animal's installed in Battersea Park, you'll be given every facility. I presume you'd thought of the need of giving the animal a tranquilizing drug before you transport it. 'Cause if you haven't, you'd better. Well, I'll lay that on, then. Good day. In our most unusual telecast to date, we bring you the arrival of Gorgo. This creature, which should have been extinct 10 million years ago, is truly an awesome sight as it is transported through the streets of modern London on its way to Battersea Park. Of course, Londoners are notoriously skeptical. And a good many we've spoken to still seem to think it's all some sort of circus stunt. But this animal is real. Take my word for it. The police have cleared all unauthorized traffic along the route as a precautionary measure. Although, we're assured there's no danger, the creature has been given massive doses of tranquilizer. Much closer to this thing, and I could do with a bit of tranquilizer myself. Actually, it's no joke. There are rumors that the animal has killed a number of persons already in the process of its capture. Now, you see the circus crowds at Battersea Park and the festival gardens where Gorgo, as he is called, we don't know why, will be exhibited to the public. Here, we can see the intrepid Captain Ryan, the one with the cap, getting out of the car with his partner, Mr. Slade. They are the men who captured the animal. And I don't envy them the job. And our own Mr. Dorkin of Dorkin's Circus in the checkered suit. And, by the way, we'll be interviewing Mr. Dorkin shortly at Battersea Park. So, stay with us. And of course, ladies and gentlemen, 00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:21,378 I realized at once that this was the most shattering scientific discovery of the 20th century. And so, I contracted for the exhibition of the animal. We've uh, we've built a special enclosure. You'll see it later on. We rushed the job through just so everyone in London will have an opportunity of seeing Gorgo for themselves. Questions? I have a report from Dublin that the Irish government are gonna take legal proceedings to recover the animal. Yes, I believe that to be true. Of course, the matter will have to go through the courts in the usual way. And since I have no way of knowing how quickly they'll reach their decision, I suggest that anyone who wants to see Gorgo does so soon at Battersea Park. That name Gorgo, does it have any special significance? My dear sir, of course! The monster of Greek mythology, the Gorgon! A creature so terrifying that the mere sight of it would turn a man into stone. Excuse me. And how much money do you expect to make out of it? I'll answer that question later on. Lower away. Lower away. Easy! Okay, Sam. Easy does it! More! More! 00:35:37,132 --> 00:35:39,332 The tranquilizer seems to be working. So far. Wire cutters. Wire cutters, quick. Okay. Cut the net, boys. That's a hell of a dumb thing to do! Over here! Flamethrowers! Come on, this way. We'll take the other side. Give it another blast! More in! Force it toward the enclosure! I want some cotton candy! Gorgo the 8th wonder of the world! Everybody in the world is talking about Gorgo but only you can see him! Only here at Dorkins! Cueing both sides. Five shillings, ladies and gentlemen! Bring the children very instructive. This way! Hurry, hurry, hurry to see Gorgo! The last remaining link from prehistoric times. Only five shillings, ladies and gentlemen! Five shillings to see Gorgo! There are still a few remaining places. Cueing both sides. Bring the children very instructive. What's that madam? Looks like your husband? Go inside and find out. 65-foot-high Gorgo! And heavier than six elephants! Ice cream here. Get your ice cream. Peanuts. Popcorn. You take popcorn. Peanuts here. Cold drinks! Ice cold drinks! Coca Cola! Peanuts. Popcorn. Chocolate. Looks like a full house. Not bad. Hi, Sam. I was driving into town. Have fun. I thought you might wanna come along. Have a couple of drinks. I'm having a couple of drinks. How's business? Great. Great. Why don't you get out of this dump? Live a little. I've got a suite of rooms at the best hotel in town. This suits us. Look, Joe, these animals are going crazy. Something's gonna happen. I can feel it. Mike's already been killed. Who's gonna be next? I'm as sorry about Mike as you are. It was a tough break. That's all. But he's got a wife and two kids. Okay, well, we'll send her some money. But he's dead. And there's gonna be a lot more tough breaks before this is over. You've been listening to your new partner too much. No. I've been listening to myself. Hello. Yeah, just a moment. It's the professor. Says they've been trying to find you. This time of night? Hello? Yeah. Yeah, if you say so. Okay. He's found something out. You coming along? Yeah, sure. Professor. Come in, gentlemen. Captain Ryan. The creature you have captured is not an adult specimen. You mean it isn't fully grown? No. In fact, we believe it is in rather early infancy. Are you trying to say there may be a fully grown one of these things around somewhere? It's a fair assumption. Where there are offspring, there are generally parents. How big would a full-grown one be? An approximate guess... The infant. The adult. That would make it nearly 200 feet tall! At the very least. Obviously, the proper authorities must be notified at once. What are you trying to do? Stir up a whole hornet's nest because of a few calculations made on a piece of paper? Nuts to that. I'm afraid Captain Ryan, the decision is no longer in your hands. Admiral Brooks, I realize the situation is fantastic, but... One expects the fantastic from you scientists these days. Tell me, Admiral, have you ever seen the animal that was captured? I'm afraid I haven't had the time. Then perhaps you should take the time. And when you do, remember it first appeared at Nara Island. Monitor reports there's been no communication with Nara Island for three days, sir. Three days? Her Majesty's aircraft carrier, Royal Oak. From the Admiralty Whitehall. Proceed to area N-3-4 and report any unusual sightings or conditions in vicinity of Nara Island. This is priority A. Repeat, this is priority A. Reconnaissance to corvette. Alter course to 3-1-0. Repeat. Course 3-1-0. Right. They've sighted something, sir. Port. Four points. - Port. Four points. - Aye, aye, sir. Fire number one turret. Reconnaissance to corvette. Observation negative. Repeat. Negative. Admiral Brooks. Gentlemen. You've been asked to come here to supply us with any information in your possession which might be helpful. Nara Island has been destroyed. Reconnaissance aircraft have sighted the creature in this area here. Excuse me, sir, that looks as though the thing's headed for England. Quite. And that in itself calls for an explanation. Do you have one? Well, we were spraying a stream of water on it during the passage. It was Professor Flaherty's instructions. Maybe it left some sort of track. I see. Is that possible? Yes, it's possible. The Royal Oak for Admiral Brooks, please. Royal Oak, coming in for Admiral Brooks. Good. They report at least two direct hits. You've killed it? It's disappeared beneath the sea. They've saturated the area with depth charges. No living thing could escape. It's certainly been killed. Capsized. Sunk. With every man aboard. This is terrible. Well, all right. Now what? What will you do? Turn that thing at the festival gardens loose, what else? Take it back to the sea while we still got a chance. What the hell's the matter with you? This is the 20th century. There must be some way of handling an overgrown animal! There's no doubt that we can stop the creature. We'll call you if we need you again. Good evening, gentlemen. Sam! Stop! He'll kill you! - Turn him loose. - Stop it, Sam! - He'll kill you! - Only chance. - Let him go! - Sam! Don't do it, Sam! He'll kill you! Sam, don't... Stop it, Sam. You're crazy! Sam! Sam! Sam! Are you all right? Sam! Are you all right? Sam! He'll be all right, kid. Following the disaster of this afternoon, the loss of the destroyer with all hands, The Admiralty has deployed major forces of the NATO fleet off the mouth of the estuary. In an attempt to locate and destroy the monster even before it reaches the coastal defenses. Tracking west 2-5. Still tracking west 2-5. Back to task fall. Search 20 degrees west. Dive, dive, dive! Hatch secure, sir. Steady as you go for torpedo attack. Course 2-7-5. Range 1500. Course 2-7-5, sir. Firing depth. Ready to open fire, sir. Fire one. Fire two. Attacking targeted search area. Attack broken. Targeted moving toward the estuary. Too fast to follow. Give me submarine control, sector 2-8. We're just closing the last of the submarine nets now, sir. Yes, sir. Yes. Yes. One moment. The nets are being torn. And the connection was gone. I see. No, there's nothing further you can do now. The creature's gone through. Smashed the nets. Get me river patrol. I'm just off the embankment. About a hundred yards away. I can see the huge beast still advancing. Second line of defense has been organized, greatly reinforced. Ready the boarding party. Look lively now. Man your stations! Petrol lines ready, sir. Open the valves! Abandon ship! Come on, hop to it! Tell them to get ready. Up here, behind those sandbags. Fire! Get me army headquarters. No, atomic weapons are out of the question. In any built-up area. Tanks, of course. Roll out, roll out! Off you go. Attention. This is a special bulletin. Civil defense authorities have declared a state of emergency for all London areas within 3 miles of the River Thames. The streets must be kept clear for military and defense personnel. If you are without shelter, go to the nearest Underground and stay there. The streets must be kept clear for military and defense personnel. All right, sergeant, get your men up there in front. On the double! Come on! Get off the streets. Go to your homes. Don't panic. You will be notified when the emergency is over. Get off the streets and go to your homes. This way. Come on! Get a move on! Up the ramp, there. Move it, move it! Take your positions! Firing positions! It's advancing upriver directly towards us. Very good, sir. Although the army indicates full confidence, they report growing casualties among their forces. We are told that Downing Street is in constant communication with other world capitals where grave concern is expressed. Call headquarters. Shoot the flares! Open side fire. Stand by! Commence... Fire! The bridge is gone! One of London's oldest landmarks smashed like matchwood. Nothing has got this beast so far. Nothing! Not even point blank cannon fire. Yes, the Tower Bridge's out. The power of this thing is fantastic! - Check the missile units. - Yes, sir! Hello. Back, back, come back! All set, sergeant? Yes, sir. Phone, please. I'm moving into position now, sir. Any estimate as to time of alert, sir? No, but stand by. Zeroing in now, sir. Yes, sir, I will. 40 degrees, 6-2-1 out. Fire! What's that? Come on. Burned out our connection. Where's Sean? Sean! Come on! All homes in this area must be evacuated at once. Do not delay. You have no time to remove your belongings. Get out of the area. Proceed in a westerly direction. Run that way, Sam. We'll meet back at Battersea. Sean! No pushing! Take it easy! It's all right, Sean. We'll be all right. Come on, Sean. This is Piccadilly. The heart of London. Words can't describe it. There's been nothing like it. Not even the worst, the Blitz. This section is complete shambles. People running mad with fear. Broken gas mains, fires everywhere. I...I can't see anything now. There's too much smoke. Piccadilly Circus? There's no way of telling where this thing will turn next. I don't care how important it is, you must interrupt. It's imperative that I speak to the Minister at once. All repent! Repent! I can't endure much longer! Your sins have visited us! Repent! Repent! Repent while you still can! Repent! Repent! Repent! I see. Well, let me know the moment you are. Thanks for coming. It's undoubtedly heading for Battersea Park, sir. That's the place to stop it. How much voltage do you estimate would be required for electrocuting this animal? Two million, Three million volts. It's only a guess. There's not much precedent to go on, sir. Quite. Get me Battersea power station. Is he okay? He'll be all right. Switch on, full power. We're waiting at Battersea. Waiting. Hoping. Praying for a miracle. The entire electricity of all industrial London has been diverted to the wire surrounding the small animal's enclosure. Will it be enough? Will it be enough to stop the huge beast? Will the miracle be granted? Or will it be yet another of man's puny efforts to oppose this irresistible force of ancient nature? Hey, Sam. So, I was wrong. Power circuit has just been completed, sir. What's the reading? Four million pounds and full amperage, sir. The wires won't take anymore. She's hurt! She's going down! No! No, she's turning the wires! What will stop her now? Nothing! We prayed for a miracle. Maybe our prayers have been answered. A great city overwhelmed, exhausted lies helpless under the immeasurable power and ferocity of this towering apparition from before the dawn of history. And yet, as though disdaining the pygmies under her feet, she turns back. Turns with her young. Leaving the prostrate city. Leaving the haunts of man. And leaving man himself to ponder the proud boast that he alone is lord of all creation. You're going back now. Back to the sea.
