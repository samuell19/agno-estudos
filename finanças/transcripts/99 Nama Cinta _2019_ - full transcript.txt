Politics and entertainment have been side by side for a long time. Talia's Lip and our investigation team will expose the facts from our trusted source, exclusively... only on Talia's Lip, not just gossip. Cut! You can sit now, Talia. Duration? -Sorry, this is urgent, Miss. -Yes? What? She is upset. She doesn't want to be on TV. What should I do? How can that be? She can't do that! -What is the duration? -We're going on air soon. -Come on. Let's go home! -No, please don't. What should we do? Tell Candra now. -Miss. -Wait, Miss. You are the one who likes to say, "Wash, wash, dry, dry." -One minute. -Yes? I really don't understand. You're used to it. Imagine how I'm dealing with it. -Yes, but... -Mrs. Fily. She's leaving. You have to force her. Bring her in front of the camera. I want her on camera. Do you understand? I feel sorry for her. This is just business. Forget your feelings. -I don't even get lunch. -Just ten minutes, ma'am. -Thirty seconds. -Just deal with it. If other programs cut us, it's your fault. -Do you understand? -Okay. I don't want it, even for just a minute. Just for a minute. We're now on the line with Mr. Bambang's wife, Mrs. Fily. Good afternoon, Mrs. Fily. Good afternoon, ma'am. How are you? -Hi, Miss Talia. I'm fine. -Okay, ma'am. Thanks for joining Talia's Lip today. Someone wants to talk to you. She is... -This is just a sweet talk. -She is our source. -Who is it? -Hi, Mrs. Fily. -You told me it is Reza Rahardian. -Hi, I am Shasha. Who are you? I am Mr. Bambang's wife. Your husband's wife. Give us some sad music. Hold. I just... I just want to tell you... that I have been married to your husband. We have been married two years ago, unofficially. What? I am here to ask for my rights to your husband. Maybe you don't believe me... but look at this picture. This picture was taken on our wedding. What? What is this? You really don't have a heart. -This is too much! -Mrs. Fily? -You are too much! -Are you still with me? We are losing signal... It seems we're having a technical problem. Thanks, Sasha, for being here. Stay with Talia's Lip. More than gossip. She succeeded in persuading Mrs. Fily. What did you do to make her available? I told her that... we have a surprise for her. That she gets a chance to have an interview with... Reza Rahadian. And she believed that. I give you two thumbs up. You are great. -Thank you, Miss. -Look at this, Cand. You should be ashamed. You are an in-field producer, she is just a new girl from the creative department. You should be more spontaneous. You should be ashamed. Send me through email... Excuse me, Miss. Someone wants to meet you. Who is it? Someone... I don't know. How come you don't know? Is it a man or a woman? It is a man. -Yes? -Did you send someone to the office? -What? -Is this one of your cousins? You sure have a lot of cousins. No. So he is not your cousin? Are you sure? My cousin will arrive in Jakarta this weekend. I'm going to introduce him to you this Saturday. What is it? Okay, then. I will tell this man to leave. I don't know who is he. What is it with her? Talia? -Please, have a seat. -Thank you. What can I do for you? I came here because I was asked to... teach you to recite Qur'an. Me? Yes, you. You have to teach me to recite Qur'an? You came to the wrong studio, this is for the gossip show. The religious show is in the other studio. -No. -The one who used to... You are Talia, Mrs. Dahlia's daughter, right? Yes. Your mother asked me to come to you. My mother? How come he knows her mother's name? Maybe he wants to marry her. I will ask my mother tonight. But... Nuk. I am so busy today. My schedule is tight. You have to excuse me. Talia. I will talk to my mother. Thank you, Ustad. You're welcome. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. -Hi, Mom. -Hi. -You still working this late. -I haven't finished yet. I have a funny story, Mom. A man came to my office this afternoon. He told me he should teach me how to recite the Qur'an. Really? I really don't know about that. He said you sent him there. Is he handsome? Handsome is very relative. He is tall, sturdy, with a brown complexion. He looks like Pak Haji. With turban, Peci, and Koko shirt. It means... he looks like our guest downstairs. What? I didn't see anybody downstairs. He is in the living room. Who is that, Mom? This is not right. He is the man that humiliated me at the office today. Who is he? He is Kiblat. Don't you remember? He is the son of Kyai Umar, your father's friend. You used to meet him when you were a child. Why should he come here and teach me to recite the Qur'an? I never asked him to. Stop it. I should finish the designing project for Mrs. Elly's coffee shop. You better talk to him, instead of me. What is wrong with you? -Okay, then, I'll meet him. -Wait... Talia. Kiblat. I am really sorry, Talia can't meet you tonight. Is that fine with you? It's okay, ma'am. I better go. Thank you for coming. -I'll take you to the door. -Sure. Talia? -Yes, Mother? -We should talk. I need to tell you something. About your father's will. Me and your father were friends to Kiblat's parents. We were so close like a family. Do you know... Kiblat's mother named you Talia. Really? Talia from the word tali (rope)... and "a" is for amanah (fulfilling). It is a hope that our band of brothers will never be broken. And it is our duty to make sure of it. That was many years ago... Mr. Umar was building his Islamic boarding school. But they were short of funding. Your father gladly gave his charity. Do you remember, when you were little... we used to spend our holiday at your father's chocolate farm? -Do you remember that? -Yes, I remember. Your father gave that farm as waqf. To help to build that Islamic boarding school, economically. Your father... he didn't study religion too well... NGRANGKAH PAWON ISLAMIC BOARDING SCHOOL SEPAWON, KEDIRI ...but he loves ulama. He loves the knowledge. That's why he tried to help with everything he can. The great part of this story is... when Mr. Umar asked your father... how can he gave the money back... your father told him that one day... he can return the favor with the knowledge. Excuse me. I need to ask you something. Where is Kiblat? Qibla? Over there. What is it with you? Qibla is always on the west. Yes, it is on the west, but you have to shift right a bit. It is on the right corner of Masjid Al-Haram. I'm not asking about the mosque, I mean to ask about Ustad Kiblat. Dear God. Gus Kiblat. Gus Kiblat's office is over there. Just straight ahead. They work in turn. Please have a drink. You accompany them... I am going to show you the product that is ready to be distributed. It's over there. Here it is. This is the product that has been packed and is ready to be distributed. You can check it. One thing that differentiates our product from the others is our students, when they are in the farm or at the factory, they have to take ablution. If they are unclean, they have to repeat the ablution. They have to keep clean until they finish working. Our purpose is... we teach the students to keep clean while working on the farm... so that they can keep their hearts clean too. About our cooperation for exporting chocolate... we agree to buy the raw chocolate from this farm, Gus. Thank God. I will send the contract draft and everything through email. -Thank you. -Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Ustad Kiblat? Yes? I need to clear up what my mother told me last night... Excuse me, I have a class to teach. Wait here. It will not take long. -Mr. Bambu? -Yes? -Wait... -My mother just told me... I am really sorry that... I came here to... -I am really sorry, my class is waiting. -Can I help you? Mr. Bambu, please get a drink for Miss Talia. You can wait at my office or here. Mr. Bambu will be with you. Excuse me, I have to go to my class. -Peace be upon you, Miss. -Peace be upon you too. I am Bambu, please have a seat. Have a seat. My name is Bambu. My students call me Ustad Bambu. You don't have to call me Ustad. Ustad is an Arabic word for teacher. Ustaaz. Just like this chair... In Arabic, it's called kursiyun. And table is maktabun. Not meja'un. I have a great sense of humor. It's okay, sir. Don't call me "sir", just call me "mas". We are the same age. I have a doctoral degree from Kuwait. Really? You can call me Mas Bams. With two "s." Mas Bams. It is not funny, right? My students always laugh when I say that. What do you want? Tea or coffee? -Tea would be nice. -You don't want coffee? -No. -We don't have tea right now. I thought you'd choose coffee. -Don't you want coffee? -I'll take anything. Coffee, then. -With sugar? -Just a little. Sure, we have some sugar. I'll make it for you. Wait here. Don't go anywhere. Last week I told you about the 99 names of Allah or Asmaul Husna. Do you still remember that? Anybody dare to explain about that? -Me. -Okay. You may begin. Asma means name and Husna means goodness. So Asmaul Husna is the good, beautiful, glorified... and noble just like Allah. Good. You should live by your words. Just like the word "love." If you just say love without any action... you don't show that you are devoted, caring, guiding... then "love" is just a word without any meaning. Or we can call it "cheesy." -Anyone here likes to say the cheesy word? -Him. He has ten girlfriends, Gus. It's okay. When you point a finger at someone, the other fingers are on you. Allah has destined. We cannot choose our family, whether it is rich, poor. We can't choose the color of our skin. Whether it is black, brown, white, dark brown... or we can't choose our race. Whether it is Buginese, Javanese, Bataknese, Chinese. That means, if we respect each other, we glorify Allah. This is Gus Kiblat's class. Okay, we go there. Where? -What should I do? -Excuse me, Gus. What do you think about a gossip show? I saw Miss Talia today. She is the host of that show. It seems she comes here to meet you. This is not gossip, guys. -Excuse us, Gus. -Yes, Pip? Miss Talia is really beautiful. -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. What did you say? Excuse me. She is really beautiful. That is not hoax, it is a fact. Now I am going to ask you. What relates to gossip? -It relates to language. -Words... Chit chat. Gossiping. You are right. What do we get from gossiping, chatting... If we relate to the 99 names of Allah... that Allah is the supreme. There is an explanation for this. Can anyone describe it? Me. Gossip is an example of using language for low-level communication. Just trying to be the center of attention, and it has no meaning. What is it? There she is, Gus. What is it, Nuk? Why was it so hard to reach you, Miss? I've got family business. Mr. Bambang's lawyer wants to meet the Program Head tonight. Mr. Bambang thinks that our program has ruined his reputation. -You don't need to panic. -One more thing. He said... our program and our source are fictitious. I am used to dealing with people like Mr. Bambang. He is just bluffing. What should I do? I will talk to Mr. Teddy. But... Miss... It's raining. Great, it's raining. I am really sorry, Mr. Teddy. I am used to dealing with a person like Mr. Bambang. He is just bluffing. I will arrive at Jakarta tonight. I am trying to hitch a ride. Please stop! Where is Mr. Burhan? Mr. Burhan, can you pick me up? Please, hurry. Talia. What is he trying to do? We got two umbrellas but he only took one. What are you doing here? I don't want to hear what you were saying before. I came here to clear up my father's will. I didn't mean to insult you. I have to teach what you heard today. So you teach your students to insult a guest? Do you know how hard it is to be a producer? We are not saints. I know that you are mad. But the road ahead is flooded when it rains. You can't go to the bus station. We better get back to school. -Just leave. I can take care of myself. -Talia. My cell phone! I'll just wait here. My God! I am dead! Just open the door, please! Help me, God! Dinner is ready, Miss. Sure. Please, take care. -We must be going. -Peace be upon you too. -Kyai. -Miss. Please, have a seat. -Mother sent you a regard. -Really? Peace be upon you too. You can rest now. Make yourself at home. On the back is the late Kiblat mother's room. And straight from there, is the girls' dormitory. Yes, I still remember. When I just started this school... your mother liked to come here and spent the night in that room. -That's my father. -Yes. And you know who are with them? -That's me. -And next to you? -Is that Kiblat with curly hair? -Yes, that is Kiblat. I have to go to the mosque. Every Thursday night we recite Salawat. Just make yourself at home. Eat whatever you want. Kids. Yes, Kyai. -Sit here with Miss Talia. -Yes, Kyai. Excuse me. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. -Where were we? -Here. What are you watching? Korean Drama. Do you need the Wi-Fi password? We got it. The Internet is quite fast. Okay, then. I hope you like it here. Yes. It is nice to be here. The air is fresh. Far from the city. -Kids. -Yes, Kyai. I have this for your mother. I hope she likes it. This is chocolate from our farm, made by our students. Really? It looks so delicious. Chocolate Bakpia. Here is Kiblat. Son? Yes, Father. Please take Talia to the bus station. Come on, I'll take you. I'm on my way to pick up our guest there. -Okay. I am leaving now, Kyai. -Okay. -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. I am just wondering. You look different today. Why didn't you dress like this before? Why do you need to look so cool? We're just going to the bus station. Do I look cool or more stylish? I came to your office looking like that because city-dwellers think, an Ustad... a religion teacher should wear kopiah... turban, koko shirt... -Wait, why should you... -I just want to look fit for them. Why do you think that about city-dwellers? Don't misunderstand me, people tend to judge other people by their appearance. I just want to be safe. Even with the way I dress, you still didn't believe me. What if I came to you looking like this? -I don't trust people easily. -Really? Okay, then. So what do you think about me, by the way I look? You can't answer it, right? I don't want to hear your lecture. Why don't we put on some music? Helps you relax, right? Music will freshen our minds. Talia. Here we are. You can ask about the bus to the local people. I am afraid you won't believe me if I tell you. Kiblat. I have my mouth to speak. I can look for where the bus is. What is it, ma'am? Peace be upon you, Husna. -Peace be upon you too. -Sorry, I am late. -How long have you waited? -I just arrived. -Is this your luggage? -Yes. -Let me help you. -Thank you. -I'm sorry. -That's okay. -How was your trip? -Good. Thank God. -Everything goes well, right? -Yes. -Pay your debt. -Here it is. -Yes, it pays off. -Thank you. -My suitcase is heavy. -That's fine. Which one is the bus to Jakarta? The blue one. -This one? -To Kediri. Yes. At Kediri, you take another bus to Jakarta. Your boyfriend didn't take you to Jakarta? Men. Typical. When he meets the prettier one, you'll be left behind. Poor you. You can get another boyfriend. Find a man who is more handsome and richer. Excuse me. -Oh, my God. -What is that? Damn! It is broken! We got a flat tire! -Everybody get out of the bus. -What happened? We got a flat tire. How long will it take to fix it? I don't know how long. -How long should we wait? -I better go back home. Just wait here. Come on, Miss. Come with us. -Wait, I am coming! -Come on, it will take a long time. -You took my passenger. -Just let us go. Dear God. Take this. Put it on. -Put it on. It is free. -It is too hot. Cover your head. Are you Miss Talia? -Are you sure? -Yes. Let me see. Yes. You are so pretty. Let's take a picture of us. Here, take it. One, two, three! We have a guest today. She is a designer and also good at playing musical instruments. My name is Husna. My name is inspired by the 99 names of Allah. Asmaul Husna. Wali songo were the ones that introduced Islam at Java. They spread Islam with art and music. Sunan Kalijaga made this song while teaching about Islam in Java. Miss Husna is going to stay here for a while to do her research. While doing her research... she will also teach you an extracurricular activity in fashion design. Be my guest. And Kyai... What about Gus Kiblat? What about him? After returning from Cairo... does he have a girlfriend? As far as I know, he doesn't have any girlfriend. Since returning from Korea until now... -Husna hasn't got any boyfriend. -But it's up to them. We, as parents, just trying to give them away. -Isn't that right? -Yes. -We're just trying to keep our tradition. -Right. Husna's mother is my cousin. Just like you and your late wife. Kiblat and Husna are also relatives. You are right. -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. Peace be upon you too. -Husna. -Mother. -Are you well? -Sure. Dear... Gus... please take care of Husna for me. If it is God's will, ma'am. Actually, I want Husna to take care of my female students. So they can broaden their horizons and have skills. If it is God's will. Sorry I am late. Please put it in my office. -Have you prepared a dress for me? -Sure. -I will try the bumper. -Makeup! Try to put it here and take out that table. -Why did you take it out? -Take out that flower, bring the new one. What did you do to my sofa? What are you doing with my set? Add another table. Hurry! Where are the crew and the cameramen? Where have you been, Talia? Are we going to do the show? Why is the studio so empty? Your program has been cut. Are you kidding? Does it look like I am kidding? They cut your program. Turn on your cell phone. Pick up their call. Mlenuk called you yesterday, trying to tell you that Mr. Bambang... Remember? Do you remember your last interview? They are going to sue you. Their lawyer came here yesterday. I was trying to defend you in front of the bosses. Where were you? The board's asking for a settlement... But we have consequences... we have to cut your program. Yes, I know. But... I did all of that because I know that I was right. Mr. Bambang is guilty, -I have all the proof. -Talia. We can win the case. I'm happy with its height. I have my own team. Can you bring my other stuff here? And she is replacing me? I am really sorry, Miss. I tried to call, but you didn't answer. Finally, I submitted your idea about that special episode. And the board likes it. Then they asked me to be the host and head of creative department. You are so cunning. Stop it, Talia. -Why did you do that? -Stop. You are the one to tell me that opportunity never comes twice. It is not wrong if I agree. Thank you so much for your creative idea. I am really sorry, Talia. Come with me, Cand. TALIA'S LIP CANDRA'S WHISPER Talia? You haven't slept yet? They cut my program. Just let it go. You have to think positive... so you don't have to be gossiping for your show. My show was the number one program. This is so fatal. They can't just cut this show. One more step then I'll become an executive producer. If it ends like this... everything I've built is a waste. Why don't you tell me... why did they cut your program? That, I don't understand... I don't know what caused all of this. It makes me confused. Everything doesn't make sense. Just tell me. A lot of things happen in this world that don't make sense. You don't have to be so philosophical. That woman was right. She said men always bring bad luck. All they can do is make a mess. A man has caused this mess? Who is he? Usually, you are the one that makes a mess in a man's life. Please, Mom. Who makes a mess of you? Kiblat. Kiblat. What did he do to you? I will call Mr. Umar. No, Mom. Please, don't. Please, Mom. The point is... Kiblat has caused all the mess that happened to me right now. Maybe it is a blessing for you. Maybe you'll get a better program. Early Morning Sermon? I don't want to be on that show. I know nothing about religion. How can I work for that program? This order comes from the directors. Can you do something about it? I know you can do it. I know your capabilities. I know you are a reliable producer, great presenter. You can survive, wherever you are. How can you do this to me? Put me on another program. I have been working for the number one show and now I'm on Early Morning Sermon? That is for the low rate producer. Think about it clearly. This your moment to prove to the bosses, that you can be an executive producer. You are so smart. Think about how to make this program into a number one show. I don't know. We'll have a meeting with the creative team this afternoon. -Excuse me. -Come in, Faisal. I have a meeting with Mr. Faisal. And don't forget your first taping, the day after tomorrow in studio five. How about your report? Here is the result report. They put me on Early Morning Sermon, Mom. Thank God. We seek refuge with Allah. How can you say that? What is wrong with that? I am happy to hear that. Early Morning Sermon. It sounds good. No. It is a program with the lowest rating. It is an outcast program. I forgot something. Here is something for you. -Who is it from? -From Kiblat. Why does he send me this? He wants to be romantic with me? That's an introduction. Before he can teach you directly. Does he really want to teach me? My life gets worse because of him. If he teaches me, my life will get even worse. Are you sure he is the one that makes all this mess out of you? Maybe all of this mess happens because you don't do what your father wishes. To end this program, Ustad Malik will give his closing statement. Please, Sir. Thank you. Dear viewer at home and at the studio... Actually, humans are... Creative team, please let them know... Don't use standby three, take wide! Cam, please... take the beautiful picture. The audience is bored. The audience is all sleepy. But if we kufr... Don't shoot the sleepy audience. Please, someone talk to the ustad. Creative team, please... -Miss Talia. -Oh, my God, Mlenuk? What are you doing here? You should be with Candra. I told Teddy. I want to be on your program. You are so weird. Thank you so much for the closing statement, Ustad. Can you help me now? Tell the ustad to be more cheerful. The audience is all sleepy. My ratings will drop. Dear viewers and audience here... We have to break after this. -You know what you should do. -Okay. Goodbye. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you. -Thank you, Mr. Adi. -You are welcome. -Please. -Peace be upon you, Ustad. Peace be upon you too. Thank you, I have my breakfast. But, sure, you can get me hot tea. -Sorry, Ustad, I am Mlenuk. -What? Mleduk (explode)? -Mlenuk. -Miss Mlenuk? Yes, I am from the creative team on this program. I just want to give you some suggestions. I know you are an expert about religious subjects. But you need to be more cheerful in delivering the subject. If you are spirited in delivering your subject... your audience will be excited to hear you, they won't get sleepy. About the content, if it is God's will, I am an expert... But about the audience getting sleepy... you should find smarter audiences. The ones that have patience, have quality. Because, religious stuff is heavy. You should talk with the ustad. Peace be upon you, Ustad. Peace be upon to you too. I am Talia, producer of this program. So, you are Talia... the presenter of Talia's Lip? -Am I not mistaken for being here? -No, you are not mistaken. Your mistake is the way you speak. You are not spirited enough. I think, if the audience looks so sleepy... it is because you seem a little stiff. If you keep doing this, my ratings will drop. Stiff? Should I talk like this? To tell you the truth, I don't like that you say that I am stiff. But, if you stay like this, sorry, I have to cut you from my program. You can find another source to replace me. If it is God's will, I will accept it. But you should pay my fee. Peace be upon you. You said, Allah is the one who gives us life and causes death. You are right, Talia. No one knows... when he will be born or when will he die. I dreamt that you were leaving. If you are not here... who will take me to the chocolate farm? Who will help me to do my homework? I have written the 99 names of Allah in this book. It will be with you when you are in trouble. We can always ask Allah for His protection... by reciting His 99 beautiful names. Miss Talia. I have an idea. I don't care if this program is ruined. I remember a guy who came to the studio, looking for you. He looks so different. I don't know. His name is... -Kiblat? -Yes, him! What if you ask him to be our source? The audience will like him. Are you kidding? Kiblat? He can't be our source. Think about it. I have been searching, in other channels, they don't use a young and handsome ustad for this kind of program with broad religious horizons. They trust the elder ustad for this program. I know. But, it doesn't have to be Kiblat. I don't want to have anything to do with him other than my father's will. I don't want to beg him to be our source. He will be big-headed. Your father's will? You are destined to be together. What do you mean? That he is destined to be on this program. That is his destiny. I don't care. I do what I can for this job. I don't care about ratings or if they fire me. I give up. I'm losing hope. Don't give up. It's not you. Do you remember, when I have a problem you are the one who lifts me up? You say, "You have to try your best. You will get the solution. Don't give up." That makes me admire you. How are you? Sorry for bothering you. How are you? Very well, thank God. How about you? I am good. I came here to ask you... I am in the middle of a class... can you wait? Please, don't ask me to wait, I don't have much time. I know I was wrong the first time we met. I was impolite. But, you cannot deny that everything that happened... that made them cut me from my program, was because of you. Now they moved me to a religious program. Now I want you to help me. I want you to be a source on my program. Wait, Talia. You're telling me that you are fired from your job because of me? I don't understand that part. I am in the middle of class and it is Tajweed class. I don't mind if you want to join us, I'll find a chair for you, or you want to wait until I finish my class, but if you don't mind, you'll have to excuse me. Where are you, Mr. Burhan? You can pick me up now. I have finished my business here. You can pick me up later. I have other things to do. -Peace be upon you, Miss Talia. -Peace be upon to you too. I am Husna. I am a big fan of yours. I like to watch you on YouTube. -Really? -A lot of people are talking about you. And I am sure it is a good thing. You are cool. You inspired a lot of people. One day I wish I can be like you. Are you one of the teachers here? I just started teaching. I just arrived. I am helping in the art class here. And what are you doing here? This place is far from Jakarta. Are you on a break? No, I just have something to do with Kiblat. Mr. Kiblat? God, he is a good man. He teaches with his heart. Our students like him. Husna, the students are waiting. Let me take you to the class. -Okay. Excuse me. -Sure. -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. What is it with you? I have been waiting for you. Please be patient. Have a drink. What do you want? Coffee or tea? -I-- -You'll like the hot chocolate. It's homemade from their farm. Thanks, Husna. I don't need to drink anything. Don't take too long. Okay, if it is God's will. It is a good thing to be the handsome kyai's son. They see the pretty girl then they arrange the marriage. And what about me? I am nothing. I have prayed to be given a spouse, I always pray to get love... Nothing happens to me. You look so scary. Wait. You mean... they have arranged the marriage for Husna and Kiblat? I don't know about that and I don't want to talk about that. Are you trying to trick me? I am not trying to trick you. I really want to ask you. Is Husna also a kyai's daughter, and they arranged for her to marry Kiblat? Or they are relatives? What's the situation? Wait. I feel dizzy seeing you walking in a circle like that. I can't comment, since I really don't know. I just want to make sure. Is it true that they arranged a marriage for Husna and Kiblat? I don't know. Why do you like to gossip so much? It's a sin. What? Do you want to touch me? Please, don't. I have taken ablutions. -No, I need to go now. -I thought you were going to touch me. Thunder. Last time I heard the sound of thunder, someone got trapped in the rain. Thanks, dear. -Is it good? -Yes. Did your mother like our gift? Sure, Kyai. Thank God. Why won't you be the one to teach me to recite the Qur'an? Did you really forget how close you were when you were kids? Do you forget about that? How come you forgot? Look at this. This is you when you were little and this is Kiblat. Remember? You both liked to run away everywhere. You played in the rain. You played hide and seek, we couldn't find you until evening prayer. Talking bad about others is like eating your brother's remains. You can imagine. You eat your brother's remains. That is so evil. So why should we talk about each other, or especially, someone we don't know? It is useless. From now on, we better use our time to train ourselves... to think positively about, and to, everyone. That's all for today, we'll meet again tomorrow. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Mr. Burhan, are you at the front gate? I will be there. I am in front of the mosque. Thank you. Talia. If you don't want to accept my offer, you can say no. Why should you insult my profession like this? You misunderstand me. I can explain. You don't have to explain anything. I just don't get it. You look like an ustad... but you don't behave like one. Wait. Every morning, we study about Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence). And today is about gossiping. Tomorrow we'll learn about Sadaqah (charity). You can come tomorrow if you don't believe me. You think I have time for that? Just forget about my offer. I made a mistake offering you that program. Listen to me, all of you! This is what I want, and this is what I like. The first episode of Candra's Whisper got the highest rating. Are you serious? Close. You just need to level up the share. Okay. -Hi, Talia. -Hi. Let me see her. Congratulation, Cand. Number one rating? Thanks, Miss. -Congratulations, Candra. -Thank you. -Okay, Cand. We have a meeting. -Wait... Don't you want to be on my program? I really care about you. I know you are so smart and creative. I don't want you to stay on a bad-ratings program. It's okay. Sorry, I have a meeting. Son. Yes, Father? I heard from Talia's mother, you refuse to be the source on Talia's program. Why? Excuse me, Father. I think I am too young to be on that show. There are a lot of Ulama that have more experience, more competence. -Why don't you play football? -Yes. -Get the ball. -Okay, Kyai. And, Father... I think Talia doesn't like me. We always fight, every time we met. What is it with you? Has Ustad Kiblat agreed? Just forget about him. What about tomorrow? -This is the presentation sheet. -Thank you. But I don't think he can make it tomorrow. The other ustad is ready, right? Yes. But he asked for double price. Are you sure? -Are you sure? -Yes. That's impossible. Son... when I tried to build this Islamic boarding school, I didn't have any money. Everything was like a dream. But one day Talia's late father said to me... "Allah works in His own way". Our Kyai used to say that. It seems that he tried to remind me of that. Sometimes as humans, we are tested with great calamity... just to prove how great Allah is. After a long and winding road... thank God, I can build this mosque and this school. Just when you were born. Listen, Son... religious talk is always good. You never know, maybe through this program... you can teach Talia to know more about religion. Just like her father's will. You have to try, Son. Allah works in His own way. Who said that Talia hates you? Who said that? If she hates you, why should she come all the way here, looking for you? What is it with you? EARLY MORNING SERMON Miss Talia? -Yes? -I want to ask you something. -Yes. -Yesterday we did this at the opening. Just do the same. Just repeat the yell. We don't want the audience to get sleepy. Just do what the ustad says, I don't want him to get mad. Which ustad? The new one? The new one? He has been here before. That ustad? You can improve on the opening. I am really sorry. I think, this is the best way to fulfill your father's will. Please forgive me. Is Husna going to be with you on the show? Ustazah Husna has an interesting story. Though she grew up in Islamic boarding school, she's been around the world. Wait. It is not that easy to change the program concept. Wait here. Mlenuk... Excuse me, guys. Where should we put Husna in? It is not that easy to change the program concept. Will be on air in an hour. It will be better to put Miss Husna in our program. Just imagine... a handsome young man, the son of a kyai... with pretty girl, also a kyai's daughter. We can make a new role model. Husna's father is also a kyai? You don't know? They call her "Ning." It is for a kyai's daughter. And Gus for the son of a kyai. This is perfect. Our audience will like it. Alright. -Just brief them, Mlenuk. -Sure. Today's episode has to be more relaxed and fun. More interactive with the audience. We want to be close to the millennials. If it is God's will. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Good morning, Ladies. Good morning. Thank God, we still can see you on Early Morning Sermon. Today is different. We have two sources. -Peace be upon you, Gus Kiblat. -Peace be upon you too. -How are you? Good? -Thank God. Peace be upon you, Husna. Peace be upon you too. I grew up in Islamic boarding schools. We should share our knowledge to society. I had a dream to travel around the world... so I could see the way Muslims live around the world. Thank God, I could make my dream come true. I can see how the Muslims struggle to keep their faith... that they have to overcome many obstacles. It makes me feel so small but on the other hand, I feel close to Allah. Whatever God wills. Prepare your question, you can ask them, but you have to wait, after this. Stay with us at Early Morning Sermon. Please take the sofa. Change the LED with the more colorful one. Mr. Surya. Mr. Bagus. So glad to see you again. -How? -I would love to. -One, two... -Are you all set? Three. For the next 100 episodes, we are going to discuss various special themes. Asmaul Husna. Thank God, today we are going to discuss the second name of Allah. Ar Rahman. This name is always connected to the third name. Do you know what it is? -Ar Rahim. -Right. That's the name that shows Allah is the Most Gracious and Most Merciful. TAJWEED LESSON Noon or tanween... Miss Talia! Our program is on the top of the top early morning programs. Thank God. You are great, Mlenuk. Do I look pretty? Do you want it? If we buy a dozen, I can get a discount for it. We can share. Each gets six scarfs. Agree? We are on a different program now, we have to change our appearance. Mlenuk. What about your report? I will continue for the next taping. Will you come later? See you, Miss. For this 70th episode, we've got a special guest. She came from Korea and she has shown her interest in Islam for a long time. -Should we call her? -Yes, please. Let's give our applause to Ayana. Whatever God wills. Ayana, how are you? -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. Peace be upon you, Ladies. Hello. Peace be upon you too. Enough. We can make that our yell. I watched all episodes of this program on YouTube. And I like the way Gus Kiblat explained about the 99 names of Allah. Okay, let's practice just like before. Ladies, Ayana greets you with this... Peace be upon you. Hello. Peace be upon you too. Hello. Hurry up, Cin. One, two, three. Go ahead. Peace be upon you, Ladies. Hello. Peace be upon you too. Hello. So actually Korean and Muslim cultures have some similarities. In ancient times, we Koreans had to wear loose clothes like this. We had to cover our private parts. -We also had to wear socks. -Really? Give them applause. I am glad that now we can exercise together like this. It's been a long time since we did this. Maybe three years ago. When you were hosting that gossip show... we hardly ever met. Morning is night and night is morning for you. What about you and Kiblat? Why should you ask about that? Do you like him? You like gossiping now. Where did you learn that? From you, of course, where else? It's okay if you like Kiblat. I am okay with that. What is it with you? And why should it be Kiblat? I am curious, why should you bake cakes in the kitchen? Now you are baking cakes. Mr. Umar is going to come over today. He has business to attend in Jakarta. What about you? Have you talked a lot with Kiblat? I am not fit for him. Husna is more suited to him. She is a kyai's daughter, she is pretty, religious, good in reciting Qur'an... -And me? -Are you jealous? What? If you are jealous... don't be too jealous. And don't over-hate someone. Or you will miss him so much. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. -Kyai. -Your hands are so cold. Please come in. Please go ahead. Don't be shy. -Mr. Umar. -Go ahead. Kiblat? Please have a seat. -Can we let the children eat first? -Sure. -Talia? -Yes, Mother? Please sit down. Why are you so nervous, child? Your hands are so cold. We are not coming to propose to you. We were invited on a formal ceremony. We came over to let the children have their lunch. You don't mind? Sure. I am glad for sure. I like it when it is cheerful here. -Afip? -Yes, Gus? Seeing them so awkward reminds me when you and your husband met. You'd look at each other, smiling. Just like that. This is material for the 100th episode. Excuse me. When are we going to hold the meeting? Soon. Sure. You were childhood friends. You've known each other for a long time. Why do you look so awkward? You often meet, right? I almost forgot the fruits. Come on, don't be shy. I've got a very simple principle in teaching. I use the 99 names of Allah as my teaching method until now. I hope that our students can absorb and apply it in their daily life-- and, in the way, the search for knowledge. -Whatever God wills. -One day... I was walking on the chocolate farm, as I walk slowly, step by step, I recite the 99 names of Allah in my heart. I recite the 99 names of Allah one by one. This is the interesting part. Suddenly I stopped under this one chocolate tree. That tree... is the most fertile one. And I stopped on the word, Allah is The Creator. It's like the answer... one thing that differentiates humans from Allah's other beings is... their capability to create something. That's the beauty of humans. This inspired me for my teaching in the fashion class. -Please have a drink. -Thank you. This is one of our products. -What do you think? Is the timing right? -Yes. We've got VT, don't forget to insert it. Sir, if the scene is like this, please... Allah has blessed all humans with the capability to form their dreams. And Allah likes those who have wills and dreams. By having wills and dreams... someone will always be praying and begging to Allah. As Allah promises us... Allah will never leave those who remember His name. What do you want to be when you grow up? Fashion designer for hijab. What about the others? -Me, Ustazah. -Yes? -I want to have my own boutique. -And me. I want to be a model. What if... we hold a hijab fashion contest. -Do you agree? -Agree! This is just an alternative for the closing... remind our audience about our 100th episode next week. Right, next week is our 100th episode. Okay, then. Camera ready... This concludes our episode today. Don't forget, next week is our 100th episode. Our special episode that will conclude all the 99 names of Allah. That's all for today. In God is success and guidance. Peace be upon you too. We've been doing it right, keep it. Don't get too complacent because our share is rising. For our 100th episode, I've told the boss that we're going to make it with a bigger concept. It doesn't have to be live on air, but with a bigger concept. We can make history by making an early morning program with the highest rating. -Amen. -Amen. For our 100th episode, you guys can contribute ideas. But my idea is... The ex-famous presenter, Talia, is involved in a love triangle. Is it true that besides having a relation with Talia... Ustad Kiblat is also having an affair with Husna? That photo is real. I did a selfie with Miss Talia when we took this truck. I feel sorry for her. That man dumped her. He just left her to pick up a girl with hijab. She is pretty. Follow her. Why should you make cheap gossip about me, Kiblat and Husna? What do you want? You are the one who told me to make up stories for our program. Now you are so mad that I made up story about you? Your program will be more famous with a story like this. Watch your mouth. I don't like that you put me on your program. I don't need that popularity. I can take care of my program. Why should you involve me? Don't take it personal. You told me before that all of this is just for entertainment. Don't involve your feelings. Excuse me, Mr. Adi. I have to talk with Mlenuk. -Nuk. -Yes, Miss? I can't contact Kiblat and Husna. I don't know where they are. Everyone is ready except them. What should we do? Is he angry? I knew that Candra has a grudge against me. I made a mistake by raising a monster like her. I don't get it, how can Candra do this to you? Let's take a break. Prepare a car, we are going to Kediri. Just make a small team. We are going to Kiblat's school. Farhan. Put it here. Put it here. Miss, who are you looking for? Help me take this. We have more refugees. On the truck, let's help them. Slowly, ma'am. The flash flood that happened at Pedongpongal River from the Mount Wilis wellspring has destroyed several homes and bridges. According to the Regional Disaster Agency in Kediri, East Java, four houses and bridges were damaged at Klebu Village, Kediri District. Take this to the shelter warehouse. FLASH FLOOD CAUSES DESTRUCTION Father! Father! Father! It's okay, dear. Are you looking for your father? Dear. Father! Dear. Thank God that you are safe! -Thank you so much, Miss. -You are welcome. Thank God, you have found your daughter. Thank you so much, Miss. Nurse, can you help? Have you eaten anything? I am fine. I ate this afternoon. But I am not that hungry. I have talked to the local authority about electricity. They have been trying all morning to fix it. They have fixed it. I hope the electricity can return to normal. I hope so. I am really sorry, Talia. I've made you worry, that you had to come here to see me. It's fine. It's not your fault. This is more important. Look at that, a lot of people need our help. What about our special episode? Don't think about that. Just let the Program Head think about it. A lot of people need our help here. My mother told me once... Allah works in His own way to arrange everything that happens in my life. Thank you for your understanding. Do you mind if I leave you? I have to find more volunteers. More refugees are coming. Will you excuse me? -Sure. -Excuse me. Miss Talia, the Boss is calling you. -Yes? -Are you on location? Can you help the news team to do the report in Breaking News? Sure. I can call the SNG team... I can contact them to make live news here. Good. What about your special project? The board has been asking me about that, I don't know what to tell them. I will have to think about it. If I get an idea for our 100th episode, I will inform you. Okay. Keep me informed. Good luck for tonight. As you see, I am at the refugee tent for disaster victims. Behind me, more and more refugees coming since this afternoon. According to our report, the flooding point keeps on rising... and flooding the disaster area. Slides also closed the evacuation path for the disaster victims. The victims seem shocked... especially for those who lost their families. But from Basarnas, Indonesian Army and Islamic boarding school... has helped them in controlling their mental state. They also get more help... in the form of food and clothes so that they feel like they get the help that they need. That's all from us. Back to the studio. Good morning, viewer, this is Candra from Candra's Whisper. We are at the refugee shelter for the disaster victim. Look who is behind me. She is our ex famous presenter, Talia. Let's meet her. Good morning, Miss Talia. How do you feel? Once you were a famous presenter... and now you are a social worker. How do you feel? Are you serious? We are working here. You should stop this interview. But our audience... is curious why our famous presenter wants to be a social worker? I don't need to answer that. Maybe she is willing to be a social worker for Kiblat? She wants to seize Kiblat from Husna. She wants to seize Kiblat from Husna. Mr. Kiblat, I want to interview you for a minute. How does it feel to be fought over by two beautiful women? One is an ex popular presenter, another one is a daughter of a kyai. Miss, just look around. We have been through difficulties. Don't ask silly questions. Please. Sir. Husna's here. Hi, Husna. How do you feel about being in this position? Let's find Kiblat. -Sir! -Hello, Miss. Gus Kiblat and Miss Talia are busy in the back. Interview me. I also have a master's degree from Kuwait. No. They're busy back there. You will like my story. Miss Talia used to like me. I thought my prayer was answered. But it turns out Mr. Kiblat also prays. -Yes. -Funny, right? I like to joke around. That's why I'm an interesting person to interview. It's okay. What else? -I want Mr. Kiblat. -Hey, Miss! You're a slapstick comedian. You must be liking Srimulat back then. Hey, Sir. My leg is gone. My leg is gone. -Where did you put it? -I put it here. When I took a look at it, it's gone. Don't record this! Miss Talia. Thank you, Miss. Miss... I am sorry. Me and Gus Kiblat have screwed up the schedule. I am sorry. We're under a bad condition. Yes, I can understand. So, what's next, Miss? I am still thinking about the next episode. I hope it goes well. Hope so. Actually, there's something I'd like to say about you and Gus Kiblat. What is it, Miss? Are we not good enough as the presenters? No. Not that. How do I say it? I'd like to ask about your relationship with Kiblat. Is it true that you two have been arranged to be married? I seek forgiveness from Allah. Oh, my God, Miss. I admire him so much. Whatever God wills. But, there's something I want to tell you. -What is it? -This is whom my heart chooses. A Korean guy. Is he your boyfriend? He is a senior at college. He's a non-Muslim. But... if it is God's will, if we are married, he will convert to Islam. -Are you serious? -Yes, Miss. Thank God. This is because of your Early Morning program that you uploaded on YouTube... and added a subtitle. He learned Islam from there. -Oh, my God. -Thank God. This is your program, Miss. It's your good deeds. -I can't believe it. The outcast program. -Thank God. Whatever God wills. So you and Kiblat are not really... Oh, my God, Miss. Can't you stop talking about him? About you and Gus Kiblat... it's clear. What do you mean? Just listen... when I was on set with Gus Kiblat... he always looks upward, to your room. -When? -The camera was down there, but his eyes searched for you. -No, he didn't. -You can see it clearly. No, I don't think he likes me. I think I'm annoying to him. Why do you think so? No, Miss. You're not. Trust me, you're not. I hope it works out for you two. I am praying from the depth of my heart. I hope you and Gus Kiblat work out. Yes, one second. Give it to Miss Talia. -There's reception here? -Yes. There's reception here. They are using satellite, Sir. Miss, there's a call from a satellite. Mr. Dedi. Sir, I found an interesting source here. You're going to like it. -Prepare the rundown. -Sure. You are also the floor director. -Well, then, everyone gets what I said? -Yes. This is really cool. Muslim fashion made by the students, designed by Husna. This is the 100th episode. So make sure this is the best of us. I'm about to be featured on television! I have to tell my family. My mother, my father, my uncle, I will be on TV. You will be only taking care of the car, Sir. -Yes, Mom? -Talia, I know you can do it. I am sure you can do it. Have faith in God, The Originator. Yes, thank you, Mom. Wish me luck. -Stand by, Nu. -Video rolling. How lucky I am. I have to take care of the car. Back with us on Early Morning Sermon. We have seen a fashion show performed by the students. Not only do they perform it, but also they are involved in the process... stitching, making, and even designing. Rebana is better than a band, ladies and gentlemen. If you're in the band, you play drum with sticks. Rebana, empty-handed. Band, after performing, you go home with money in your hand. Rebana, empty-handed. As the leader of this boarding house, we'd like to thank our volunteers... the students, and National Search and Rescue team... who have helped us so that there are no fatalities. -Before ending this... -Yes. ...the conclusion of the 99 names of Allah... is that every name of Allah is the name of love. His severity equals His kindness... His tenderness, His affection, and His love of us. Everything that has happened, be it natural or man-made... it is the real existence of His love to us all. See you on the next Early Morning Sermon. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you and God's mercy and blessings. Talia, come in. Sit down. What is it? This is it. This is what I want. This is Talia. Share 30, rating three. That's crazy. This is Early Morning Sermon, Talia. Thank you and congratulations. How is it? Are you ready to become an executive producer? Sure. So you're ready to be back on Talia's Lip? -What do you mean? -Bring Talia's Lip back. -Me as a presenter again? -Yes. You're the one who wants to be back on a gossip show. You can make the rating high. You have a lot of fans. Talia, honestly, I only rely on you. I cut Candra. Her program rating and share are dropping. The directors keep scolding me. I can't help it anymore. The people working in the field don't like her. They complained. She is such a diva, very demanding. -Please, I can only rely on you. -I am... How do I tell you? I am not sure... What percentage? What percentage do you need for a pay raise? I'll meet Mrs. Dewi this afternoon. I'll submit the request. Talia, think about it. You're back to Talia's Lip... as an executive producer. Come on, think about it. Ladies and gentlemen, thank God we come to the end of this program. If it is God's will, we got a lot of knowledge from our teachers here. I'm Adi Nugroho and I have to say goodbye. See you on the next episode. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Okay, those who sit in the front line can exit first. Stay here. -Make the line. -Can we take a picture? Make the line. Make the line. -Sir. -Yes? Come here. Where's Talia? She's taping for Talia's Lip, Ustad. -I see. -Yes. -Thank you. -Okay, Ustad. Go on. Please check carefully. -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. Enough. You... -You're taping for the show, right? -No. It's done. Thank God everything went well. Congratulations. Your program is back on air. Honestly, Talia, I'm confused. Should I be happy or not for your comeback to your old show? But congratulations! -I get to go. Peace be upon you. -Wait... Kiblat. -Kiblat, you should... Kiblat. -Miss. Stand by for the last segment. Help her. Okay. Okay. TALIA'S LIP Mr. No, how did you deal with the disaster being so hard? First, I want to say thank you for the National Search and Rescue Agency. They evacuated the residents. I met my child there. At the time, his child was in hypothermia. She was so cold. So, we evacuated her and took her to the paramedics. We need to make sure that all of the victims are safe. And for the rest, we leave it to Allah SWT. Thank you for my guests tonight. I want you all to give them a big round of applause. Today we get so many lessons about how Allah controls human lives. From 99 names of Allah, we believe that Allah is The Overseer. In any difficult condition and catastrophe we're facing... Allah works in His own way to save us. But there's one thing that comes to my mind. Why only 99 names of Allah? Why doesn't He make it to 100? This is the end of this episode of Talia's Lip for today. See you on the next Talia's Lip. Not talking about gossip. Miss. Do you still remember how arrogant I was, Nuk? I didn't care about the feelings of the people around me... that I have taken advantage of. On the contrary, I was dancing on their death. Don't you remember, Nuk? I was so proud of my position... that I'd built since the beginning of my career. But my heart was so empty, Nuk. Miss. I'm too late for Kiblat. No, you're not. Miss. Miss Talia, I'll wait for you in the control room. When you feel better... we'll eat something. So, you'll be cheerful again. -Okay. -Okay? -Okay. -Go. May I have your autograph? Here, in my hand. I'm sorry, I don't have paper. May I? Answer my question first. Your question? I'll try to answer. In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. 99 names of Allah are perfect. All of those names reflect Allah's love that He gives to His creatures. Have you realized? Crocodiles and lions are wild animals... but they really love their cubs. Likewise for very naughty children who still miss their parents. And for the same reason... even though I'm very upset with you... I'm still thinking about you. Thinking about me? Since when? Since... Since a long time ago. -Long time ago? -Yes. When? When the time... before the flood. When... Mlenuk wasn't born yet. If Mlenuk wasn't born yet, that means I was a little girl. You're still little. So am I. Because we're adults now... we should... get married. There's a young girl here. I seek forgiveness in Allah. You can continue your conversation in the family room. Oh, my God! Mlenuk, are you eavesdropping? No, I'm not. You forgot to take off your microphone. So, we can hear you. Well, you've heard, right? -Will you be the witness? -Okay. She'll do everything. I seek forgiveness in Allah. Can you write your name in Arabic? Of course I can. Let me see. Hey, don't cheat. Don't cheat. -Okay, let's go. -Let's go.
