Mosfilm Studios OCTOBER This film was made in 1927 by masters of the nascent Soviet cinema, headed by Sergei Eisenstein, for the 10th anniversary of the Soviet Republic. The events of 1917 were restored with the best possible precision. The camera depicted many participants of the Revolution: workers, Red Guards warriors, soldiers and sailors including Nikolai Podvoisky, one of the leaders of the armed rebellion. At the time of filming Leningrad, with its streets and buildings, halls of the Winter Palace, Smolny Palace, the trams, automobiles, weapons, clothes were exactly like they used to be during the historical battle for the Soviet power. Thus the film 'October’ that reached us, during the 50th anniversary, from the far past, is a true-to-life evidence of the ardent initiation of our state. Simultaneously, it will remain, for all times, as a wonderful piece of Soviet art, a great work of the world’s best film directors. 'October’ belongs to the 'silent’ period of film-making. It was converted into a sound version by Grigory Alexandrov, Eisenstein’s associate. The film score was written by Dmitry Shostakovich.
