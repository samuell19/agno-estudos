( electronic music playing ) >> Yeah, oh, yeah ! ( club music playing ) ( glass shattering ) >> Hey, how y'all doing ? Yeah, that's good, that's good. My name is Neville Emerson Carter. It's my first time out. I got a story I want to tell you all. A fable about brothers. Fire and Ice. Ladies and gentlemen, my brother Matthew Fire. Matthew can't find love. Just good ol' fashioned sex. I tell him, "Man, love runs "deep, sex only has to go a few inches." I tell him, "Love is sweet. Sex... sex is just soft." >> Get the ladder, man ! >> Knock him out, man ! Knock him out ! Yeah, that's it ! Yeah, yeah ! Hit him again, again. >> Me ? I stole everything, man. Everything. The TV, the VCR, the microwave. Well, I had a little problem stealing the microwave. ( glass shattering ) Shit. I used to do it all, man. I was sniffing, snorting, chorting, all that shit ! You know, I had drug etiquette down to a mother fucking "T" ! So they say that when you put cocaine on your ding-ding, it lets you fuck all night. I used to spend so much money on getting my dick hard. What was that about ? Matt, what's going on ? Where you been, man ? >> Come on, Neville, get up. >> Man, I've been like partying. >> Fuck, now get up ! >> Hold on, I wanna party ! Now Matthew, man, he beats up other people. I on the other hand, I beat up myself. Why can't we just dance ? Hey, Matt, man, what's-- >> Come on, fuck, get up. Get up. ( Neville laughing ) Hey, Matt, man, you gotta punch a little harder than that. The kind sisters at Holy Order, they took me in. You know, they showed me love. >> Yeah. You're harlots. In here you will not get stoned. You'll have no visitors, no contact with the outside world. You are the guests of the Sisters of the Holy Order. ( whispering ) These things I remember as I pour out my soul. How I went with the thrall and led them in procession to the House of God. >> Took me three months to purge myself; I mean, I didn't see anybody. And tomorrow, I'm back into the world. ♪ We at the club ♪ ♪ You know how to do it ♪ ♪ We all in it ♪♪ >> Neville ? The rules are the same as the first day you joined us. Lights out in a minute. >> Yeah, yeah, okay, sister Sarah. But ya'll, that's my turn. I'm Neville Emerson Carter. I wanna thank you for coming out to the show. Peace. >> Who are your roommates, anyway ? >> Julian, he's the guy downstairs. You know my brother, Neville, he comes home tomorrow. >> You didn't tell me you had a brother. Are you guys close ? Where is he ? >> You're good, you're good. >> Sister Sarah was sponsored where you are right now. She's come back as a novice to share and to serve. >> You go to a club, a bar, a watering hole. You'll have no fine wine, no purple pills, no bruskies, no 40's, no spirits, no mickys. He's not your friend. Nothing material can give you that high you once craved. The way to ecstasy is through yourself. We have a new additon to the riot act; goes by a variety of names, the one that's catching on is "bliss." You do not partake. You do not need to feel inebriated or stoned to feel loved. Good luck. >> Hey. >> Hey. Umm, Julian, Ceanna. Ceanna, Julian. >> It's nice to meet you. >> Hi, nice to meet you. Sorry about the noise last night. >> That's all right. Enthusiasm is a great thing. >> I gotta go. >> Okay. >> Call me later. >> Yeah. ( door closing ) >> Mmm, lovely creature that Ceanna; even more lovely than the last one. When are we picking up Neville ? >> Soon. >> Hey, don't touch the toaster. >> Neville. Your brother's here. >> Oh, thanks. I'm going to miss you, Neville. You have a good soul. >> You don't have to miss me. What are you doing on Saturday night ? Maybe we can hook up, you know, go peep out a movie, surf the internet; what you think ? >> I'm busy Saturday. I'm washing my hair and serving God. >> You know, that's what I thought you would be doing. >> And now that you know that-- >> I know. God loves me. >> That's right, Neville. God loves you. Take care. >> Thank you. Hey, what's up ? What's up Jules ? >> You look good, man. Like a recently deprogrammed cult victim. >> I'm feeling good. What's up, Matt ? >> Hey. >> So who are you going to look after 'till I get back, Neville ? >> After Matthew. >> Uh-uh. >> I promise the vampires won't get him. >> How about you, sport ? Who are you going to look after ? >> After Neville. >> Good. >> That's right, you guys look after each other; if anything goes wrong you go next door to-- >> Julian's. >> That's right. >> Okay, baby, let's go. Let's go, these guys are gonna be all right. >> You guys take good care, okay ? ( Neville whistling ) ( laughing ) >> Mom forgot to pay the light bill again. >> No, when's mom getting home ? >> Don't worry, we'll just light some candles. >> Hey, Neville, man, when's your next audition for the comedy club ? >> Two weeks... I'm counting. >> You'll make it this time ? >> No doubt. What you mean "this time" ? A little support. ( telephone rings ) ( Neville humming ) >> You quit ? >> Yeah. >> Hey, Matthew, it's Ceanna. >> Ehh, tell her I'm not here, man. >> Oh... The lover ! There's nothing worse than selling shoes. The shoe salesman business, that shit is-- fuck that ! Serious, man, I felt like a whore: On my knees, making my money in front of strangers. What was that shit about ? Didn't matter, as long as I was getting paid. I said: "Fuck it, try the shoe on, bitch; it don't matter." Check this out, man. Hear that sound ? ( bell ringing ) ( hip hop club music ) >> Wooh ! >> Yeah, yeah, yeah. >> Hey, Neville. >> Hey. >> Where you've been ? I haven't seen you in so long. honey. >> Yeah, I've been in exile. >> Oh, great to see you. >> Yeah. >> Hey, I got something.

You forgive me ? >> Yeah, it's Okay. >> You know, God must be missing an angel because there's one standing right next to me. I'm sorry. Would you like to go out for some Sicilian ice cream some time ? >> You ever told a woman you loved her but you lied ? You only wanted to see what the small of the back looks like when it's arched ? >> She had a nice back. I'm Neville Carter, I sell shoes. >> I'm Niko Rosen, I wear shoes. Are you a bullshit artist, mister shoe salesman ? Are you bullshitting me right now ? >> Yes... No, no, no ! Only not to cause pain. >> You're causing pain now ? >> No, I'm living pain-free. You tell me something: Are you sent by the Gods to punish me or to bless me ? >> Why ? Do you need to be spanked for your sins ? >> Rosen. What is that, Scandinavian ? You from Coppenhagen, Ms. Rosen ? >> Jewish, I was adopted. >> Wow. So what is it like growing up in a Jewish house ? >> Kosher. Nice to spar with you, Neville Carter; I have to go finish the next set. >> No, no, wait, wait. I was serious about that Sicialian ice cream. >> In Sicily, when a man was courting a woman, she would send him on a quest; if he succeeded, then she would become his lover. She'd send her pseudo on a mission to fetch her the fangs of a scorpion, wedding dress from a Zulu tribe or a signed testimony from children who'd seen The Virgin Mary. >> You want me to slay a dragon for you ? >> There are no dragons in this town. Get a Sicilian ice cream and keep it hard and cold, and don't let it melt; meet me out back after the next set. >> Right. >> Don't let it melt. Don't let it melt. Uh-uhh. I'm gonna tell you, it's going to be real hard. >> Keep it hard and cold. >> Yes. >> Mm-phh. >> Mm-phh ! Mm-phh. >> That's a lot of ice cream. >> Yeah, you can do many things with this ice cream. >> Oh, really ? >> Many things. >> You're home. >> I'm home. >> You haven't been around a couple of days. Where have you been ? >> Here and there. >> Here and there ? What the fuck does that mean ? >> First I'm here, then I'm there and now I'm here again. >> This is Neville. He sells shoes. >> Mr. Rosen, how are you ? It's a pleasure-- ( sink faucet sprinkling ) >> Let's go. >> So this is your place, huh ? >> Mm-phh. >> Got your own little place in the back. >> Yeah. >> Let's get married. I... I, I told myself that the next woman that I kissed I would, I would marry. >> Let's see if you can make my back arch first; a husband should at least be able to do that. >> Maybe we should get married. I'm having a little, a little performance anxienty right now and... we should talk. >> Talk. >> Yeah, you know, talk. You know, let the blood get time to flow to the vital parts. >> What do you want to talk about ? >> Stuff, you know. >> When you have an orgasm, do you... call out the divine ? Like: "Oh, God," "Oh, God," "Oh, God." Or do you use the person's name ? For example: "Oh, Neville," "Neville," "Neville !" >> I seek a higher power. >> Good, 'cause I read in GQ if your girlfriend, wife or spouse, on the key time calling the divine, then it's good, it's genuine. But that if she says your name it's $3 bill, facsimile, a fake. >> Okay, uhh, you on crack ? >> No, not anymore. Let's go dancing. >> I like dancing. >> You like dancing ? Yeah, we should go dancing next weekend; I always say: "Why "can't we just dance, people ? Why can't we just dance ?" Yeah. The blood has rushed into the vital parts now. >> Good. >> Umm, you know, two things about the Sicilians: they got a 1,000 ways to kill a man and they make the very best ice cream. >> That's it ? >> Yeah. >> Okay. >> Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. >> Oh, Oh, yeah. One, two, baby, give it to me ! Come on. Julian told me about what happened to your dad. I've be-- I've been practicing. See ? Keep my chin. Wow, go easy, that was-- Gonna fire at you, man; you got no defense. Is that going to happen to you on the next fight ? You're gonna get KO'ed by some unrated contender ? ( loud thuds ) Ohh, fuck ! Jesus Christ, you asshole, I was just playing ! Oh, fuck ! >> I'm sorry. >> The fuck you're doing man ? I'm just playing. >> I'm really sorry, I'm sorry. >> Are you fucking insane ? Owww ! >> Watch your step. >> Fuck, what happened to the lights ? Baby, you didn't pay the light bill ? >> No, I gave you the money to pay it. What did you do with it ? >> What did i do with it ? >> Yeah. >> Fuck, I forgot it. I don't know what I did with it. >> You probably smoked it, you fucking bastard. >> You are bad. >> It's been a while, huh ? >> Excuse me ? >> It's been a while. >> You could tell ? Have I got rust falling off my ass or something ? Hey, what's up with this crazy place; you keep missing breaks and everything. >> My parents were building it before they adopted me, and mom always wanted them to finish it. They never did. I kinda like it raw like this. >> She going to be okay ? >> She's better than they said she would be. She's a real fighter. I think I'm going to go look for my birth parents. >> I'll come with you when you go find them. >> What about you ? What about your folks ? >> You believe in unconditional love ? >> You know, whenever I really like someone I usually reject them. >> I hope you ain't like that. Dance with me. >> You've got a lot of love in you, Neville. >> Let's dance. >> Come here, I'll kill you, you fucking shit, Come here. >> Hey there, hey there. >> Hi, Mom. I wasn't scared, I looked after Matthew like you told me. >> Yeah, Julian brought over a flashlight. >> Julian, you saved the day, huhh ? >> Yeah. Good for you. Let me get you to bed, it's awfully late; does your mommy know you're here, by the way ? >> Yeah. >> Nice, nice. >> Let's go to bed. >> Hey. >> You smell like sex. >> Thanks, Mom. >> Do you like him ? >> Yeah. >> It's somebody that you're going to be with ? >> I don't know. >> Who is he ? Is he any good ? >> He made me laugh. >> Yeah ? >> Yeah. >> That's good, baby. That's a plus, darling. That's a plus. >> Who is that guy ? Is he going to be coming around here ? >> Don't worry, Ira, he's not going to steal the China. >> Every week is a different guy around here. >> What difference does it make to you who I sleep with ? >> Excuse me, I didn't get your number. >> I'll call you. >> I didn't leave my number either. >> I'll call 411: Neville Emmerson Carter. >> Carter, yeah, yeah. Mr. Rosen, hopefully I get a chance to see you again soon. And thanks for letting me stay over. >> Bye. >> Bye. Hey, if you even dream about whooping my ass, you better wake up and apologize. Hey, man. >> Hey. >> I was on my way to work, I thought I'd come by and say hey. >> Where did you get to last night ? >> I met a girl... she wanted ice cream. >> The singer ? >> Uh-huh. Ten bucks says she has about three of my kids. >> Oh, yeah ? >> Yeah. >> So, maybe she's a candidate for a 2nd date then. >> Oh, no, this is in the stars, man; I'm telling you, it's in the stars, I can feel it, my brother. >> Will you come to the fight ? >> Man, I would not miss that fight for the world. I mean, you're just going to literally beat the shit out of this guy. >> You know, when dad used to make us spar when we were kids ? You always used to win. >> You never quit. >> No, and neither did you. >> I'll let you get back to your workout, I know you're busy. >> Come on, why don't you spar with me a little bit ? >> What was that ? >> Come on. >> Ohh, you sure you want this heat ? You want me to get in there with you ? >> Yeah. >> No, you don't want this, man. And you know I have to go to work so, please, go easy on me, alright, champ ? Alright, champ, I'll show you a little heat; I see what you got, I'll let you see what I got. You gotta keep those hands up.

( sound of audience cheering ) Alright, yeah. Beautiful women. A lot of beautiful women. Let me see. Talk about the mothers. Come on, man, we don't have to talk about the mothers, alright ? Let's just get off mama's because you know I just got off yours. Hey, man, what's up ? >> So, Neville Carter. So, what is this, your fourth time ? >> Yeah, fourth try, fourth try and-- >> I'm going for the record. Well, what kind of yucks are you peddling this time ? >> Well, I got some genuine snake oil to cure all ailments with laughter, my man, yeah. >> Whenever you're ready, administer the ointment. >> Yeah. I got a confession to make, first of all; when I was a child I was sexually abused. I was about six or seven. I was in a park and this old guy, he touched me there. Shit fucked me up, man, you know; I was really, really upset because when I went back to the park the next day he was gone. You know, I was like: "Hey, man, "I thought we were friends. "Where's my chocolate bar, at least ?" Yeah, that's it, I wanted my-- I wanted my chocolate bar, man. So, luckily for me, there was another old-timer out there who loved to give away candy and-- ( loud heartbeat ) >> Well, I tell you, Nev, the snake oil is getting better but something's just missing and you ain't quite there yet. >> Well, I'm still working out some bugs in my act, just trying to get it all cleaned up. >> Oh, man, you gotta call an exterminator to get rid of all the bugs in your act. It sucks, what do you want, you know, I'm trying to be nice. It sucks, okay ? You would give brand-new meaning to the word "amateur night" if I was to stick you on. You know, maybe you gotta go to some of the other open mikes around town; maybe you need to hire a writer. But, you know, you're just not ready here yet. >> Well, like I said before, I'm going for the record. You know... ... going for the record. My family sucks ? Why you got to come up here and fucking with me, alright ? I mean, I'm just up here trying to do my thing. I don't go down to your momma's job knocking the dicks out of her hand, do I ? Well, come up on stage and say that. You don't know my family, alright ? So enough of that shit about my father. Shit. ( slow tense music playing ) Come on, Matt, it's your turn. Ahh... we're gonna eat >> So, Matthew. You know that they brought slaves to the West Indies to cut sugar cane so that Europeans could have something sweet to put in their tea. My forefathers cut cane. You know what forefathers means ? You see, this is what they used right here, machete. Machetes cut cane and serve justice. You always get justice with a machete; right, Neville ? >> Yeah. >> To escape the reality let's smoke. Let's smoke the herb, a gift from Ja to get higher. >> Dad, can I have a puff ? I can smoke and I'm not gonna waste it. >> Yeah, now I know you're really a man, kid; damn. And then the slave master would come down from his big house and go around the back. To the slave quarters, and have the "negras." Sometimes it was his own doctor. The man never couldn't do shit. ( puffing ) That's how come I'm discolored. She'll be black like Africa, right, Julian ? >> Black is beautiful. >> Yeah. >> Matthew, your turn now, take a draw. >> I don't wanna. >> Go ahead, Matthew, take a draw. >> I don't want to. >> Hey, I'm not going to ask you again, mon; take a fucking draw like your brother. >> I don't want to. >> Smoke this fucking thing. ( smacking ) Hey, hey, why you crying for ? I give you anything to cry about ? >> Stop your fucking crying. >> Dad, I can smoke it. Look, dad, I'm smoking it. I won't let anyone waste it. >> Gimme that thing, man. >> Yeah, can I speak to Neville Carter, please ? Yeah, it's his brother. I just wanted to remind him he's supposed to be home after work. What are you talking about ? Fired ? >> I tell you, ma, the person that came up with the pennyloafer, I mean, they should be given a medal; I can't stop selling these things. One after the next. Bam, bam. ( fingers snapping ) You know what I think I'm gonna do with my money ? Think I'll go ahead and invest. You know, stock, you know. Do stuff in Hush Puppies. You know, my manager told me that Hush Puppies is a good thing to-- >> Mom. Did you love Leon ? >> Yes. But I loved you more. >> And I was thinking that, Matt, maybe you can invest some of your earnings in-- Mom, have your bunions been hurting lately ? Because we got this new shoe in the store that-- Hey. Mom was real happy to see us. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. >> And that's where sugar come from; you can buy sugar cane anytime you want and eat it. And my mom-- >> Hey ! >> Mom's home. ( giggling ) "Hi," mom. >> It's kind-of smelly in here. >> Mom, what did you bring home to eat ? >> You hungry, Neville ? Leon, did you give the kids something to smoke ? >> Of course not, baby. I wouldn't do something like that, mon, you crazy ? >> Mom, when are we going to eat ? There's got to be patties in there. >> Neville, did your dad give you something to smoke ? >> Hey, didn't you hear what I said, mon, you don't believe me ? Hey, Matthew, did I give you anything to smoke ? >> No. >> There, you see ? Come on, baby. >> Neville, look at me ! Did your father give you something to smoke ? >> Answer your mom. >> I told dad I could smoke it; I wouldn't waste it. >> Alright, baby, look. I gave him a little bit but it's not going to do them anything. Alright ? >> What's wrong with you ? You don't give kids weed to smoke. >> Relax now, baby; I told you, it's not going to do them anything. >> Fuck ! Are you-- You smoked them up, I can't believe this. What kind of father does that, huhh ? What kind of father does that ? ( loud smack ) ( Neville laughs hysterically ) >> Neville Emerson Carter. I thought you left me for good. Never. Your smile is like sunshine in this cruel, harsh world. >> That's sweet; are you trying to get with me, Neville ? Because there's that whole "vow of chastity" thing. Oh, that ? Just me, you and a motel manager would know. >> Why'd you come ? I know it's not just to flirt with me. >> Peace. >> Be still, peace will come. >> Still, hard to be still. I want to be like Jay-Z, getting higher. >> Getting higher is wanting something greater than ourselves. >> Yeah... what's that ? >> It's always been about the same thing, Neville: Love. >> Love. >> When I used to get high I was searching for ecstasy.

( doorbell ringing ) >> Hi, is Dean Thompson home ? >> Leslie... why don't you go on in the house and get that... that thing I was wrapping up last night, would you sweetie ? Thank you, baby. Happy birthday. Made it myself, it's... ... a phoenix. I've been making a little something for your birthday every year. I just figured I'd see you one of these times. >> Thank you. >> It's nice... real nice. You just need to fix her up. >> What is this, it's like a sweatshop; no more work. >> I have a little sister. That's cool. >> Yeah... I don't have any sister, just my brother. He's tough. Did Dean say anything about your biological mom ? >> No, I didn't ask... not yet, anyway. Thanks for coming. >> Mmphh. >> You're the first boy that Niko ever introduced us to. Actually, she did bring home a few strays when she was younger but never anybody as good-looking as you. Nice to meet you, Neville. >> Nice to meet you too, Mrs. Rosen; Mr. Rosen. >> I'll meet you at the cottage. >> All right. Take you time. >> I like Neville, he's a nice young man. >> I like him too. Ira hates him. >> No, he doesn't. He's just proud. He doesn't always understand what you feel, you know that. But he's your father and he loves you. >> Does he ? >> Do you love Niko or do you just want to fuck her ? >> I love her... and I want to keep fucking her. >> So, who picked up who ? I mean, did you pick her up ? Did she pick you up ? Or was is it, was it kind-of a chemical thing hitting you both by surprise ? >> I picked her up. >> And Neville, tell me something. Do you know your father ? I mean, is he around ? >> He was around. >> Where is he now ? >> Not around. >> Well, Niko didn't know her father, I mean, her real father. But, you know, he fucked her mother... probably just one of many; didn't love her, I'm sure. I mean, not like you love Niko. >> Yeah. >> Yeah, I'm sure he's the kind of man who has kids everywhere and not care for any of them. And Niko is just another one. Sure your father didn't do that. I mean, that's why we adopted her, you know. You know, black baby. >> You can't leave me, you know. >> You remember that I'm your momma and I love you. >> I know, 'Ma. >> Let me see your face. >> No, don't. >> I don't know what you want, man, what you want ? You want to hate me ? >> Yes. >> I want to smash your fucking face in. >> Come on, go ahead; smash my fucking face in, go. Come on ! >> You... bas... tard ! >> Okay, okay, okay, okay. We're even now. >> No, we're not. >> Baby, I'm sorry. I don't know what the hell I would do if you weren't with me. I love you. >> I hate you. >> I love you. And I'm sorry. I love you.

Do not... sell... this toaster. >> Jules. >> What ? >> You think... I'm going to sell your toaster ? It's absurd, man. >> Man, this isn't a discussion, alright ? Don't sell the toaster. >> Alright. Besides, I couldn't get more than four-five bucks out of the thing ayway. >> Right. ( bell rings ) >> Bliss, I mean, I felt good man; you know, just like love. We owned that bliss, man. You just want to love everybody. I was kissing motherfuckers I didn't even know. ( smooching sounds ) Imagine if everybody in the world were on bliss. It'd be a good thing; there would be a lot of fucking going on, I could tell you that. ( Neville and Niko laughing ) >> Hi. >> Hi. What are you doing here ? >> You don't return calls anymore ? >> I was busy. Can I come in ? Let me in. >> It's not a good time. >> Where's Nevillle ? >> He couldn't make it. >> I didn't do this for us to come apart. You stay together as a family. Okay ? Huh ? ( uplifting instrumental music ) >> You want some ? >> What is it ? >> Sugar cane. >> Never had it before. >> Well. You don't swallow it though; you chew it up, spit it out. >> Okay, I get it. >> When we were kids... our dad used to lecture us about how the juice in the sugar cane was the sweat of the slaves that cut it. >> Really ? >> He'd sit with me and say: "Matthew, you know, the slaves "were brought to the West Indies "to cut the sugar cane so that "Europeans would have something "sweet to put in their tea. "You know, my forefathers cut "the cane. "That's what the machete is for. "Machete was for cutting the cane and serving the justice." And he said: "You could always get justice with this." >> Neville told me about your Leon. >> Gonna come to the fight ? >> Yeah, that's all Neville talks about. >> Does he ? >> Mm-phh. Good night, Matthew. Good luck tomorrow. >> Testing-- >> Lookie here, Neville, we're running a little bit late, so, whenever you're ready. >> Right, right, right, yeah. Well, shit, man, I'm ready to go... get this mike stand over-- Alright: Yo, yo, what's up, yo ? What's up ? I'm Neville Emerson Carter and I got a story about Fire and Ice.

She's in, you know, she-- My father used to fight and shit and he slapped her one day and, you know, she went crazy. And now, now she's in... prison. >> Thank you, Neville. Thank you very much. >> Just... just let me get a minute, man, 'cause... I really want to be up here, man. I wanna be on stage and have some fun, so just don't fuck with me right now. >> Thank you ! >> Just... just fucking chill, man, alright ? Everytime I come in here you always fucking rushing me. Motherfuckers stay up there for 10 minutes and you rush me. What is that shit about ? Fuck, I mean how can I concentrate when you're always saying "Next, next, next" ? All that bullshit... fuck ! Fuck this shit. Shit. I'm gonna fuck you up, man. Uh, ah, I didn't mean, I didn't mean to say I was gonna fuck you up; I was just joking, I like to joke with people like that. Wait...

I mean, I don't think he understands me right now. >> Gotta focus, focus; go, go ! That's it, that's it, that's it. Oh, Matt, look, you're not doing what I told you to. You have to keep him away from you, away from you with the left, like that. Don't quit, he'll get on the inside, Matt, you can't let him do that... alright ? If he pushes you, push him back. Hits you once you hit him twice. Are you listening to me ? >> Yeah, dad, I'm listening. >> Hear me out; I know you can do it, now come on !

You know you can't quit, don't quit, Matt, come on. Don't quit ! Get up ! Come on, Matt, you gotta do it, get up ! No, Matt, you're not supposed to quit; you're not supposed to quit. ( huffing and struggling ) >> Get off him, Matt. Julian ! >> Matt, move, move ! Hey ! >> What the fuck ? What the fuck, Jules ? >> Get up, Neville. >> You don't like the fucking sugar cane. >> So what, I was hungry. So fucking what with your sugar cane ? >> You got the fucking jaw of a fighter ? I'll show you up then. >> So what if he's hungry, Matthew ? >> Shut the fuck up ! >> Fuck you. >> I fucking hate you. >> The fuck is wrong with you ? >> Oh, you want to kill me now ? What you gonna do to with that, Matthew ? What the fuck you gonna do with that, Matt ? >> I'll fucking kill you ! >> You wanna kill me ? >> Neville, stop. >> Is that it ?

Kill me. >> Stop it. >> Matthew. I'll quit if you quit. Why does it hurt so much ? >> I don't know. I got to go see my mother. Wait a minute... let's dance. I think we should dance, you know I need you. >> You only need you. I love you, Neville. >> Do you ? >> Yes. >> But not like this. >> ( whispering ) Niko. >> Probably got a lot of questions. >> You promised to tell me about my mother. >> I was... umm... working on this guest cottage. For these people were very, you know; the guy was very succesful, his wife was very beautiful. Fabulous home and the couple was looking after this old lady, it was the husband's mom. This old lady, she just sat there staring at me. Just, staring, and it was unnerving, you know. After a while she brought me a cold drink and I thanked her for her kindness. And a while later I was dumping something out in the garbage and I noticed that glass that she had given me to drink was in the trash can; she had thrown it out. Thrown it out. And I said to myself: "Maybe she knows. "Maybe she knows that I was in "love with her son's wife, maybe "she knows that I loved this "woman more than I've ever loved anyone." Yeah, so... this man, he's very proud when he finds out that his beautiful wife is pregnant. His beautiful wife who he was told would never be able to have a child. They told everybody that the baby had died at birth. And that man, he took this beautiful little baby, and he told her that she was adopted and then he raised her as his own. >> Mom. >> I am your mother. >> "Make a joyful noise to "the Lord, all the Earth. "Worship the Lord with gladness, "come into his presence with "singing, know that the Lord is "God; it is he that made us and "we are his. ( techno music in background ) "We are his people. "We are the sheep of his "pasture. "Enter his gates with "thanksgiving and his courts "with praise. "Give thanks to him, bless his "name. "For the Lord is good. "His steadfast love endures "forever and his faithfulness to all generations." ♪ Ohhhh ♪ ♪ Ohhhh ♪ ♪ Ohhhh ♪ ♪ Ohhhh ♪ ♪ Ohhhh ♪ ( techno music continues ) ( electrocardiogram beeping ) ( constant beep ) ( clock ticking ) >> Your brother's here. >> All right, thanks. >> Neville. >> Yeah ? >> God loves you. >> I know. >> God loves you.

I see Dean is finishing up your house; I thought you liked it raw. >> Well, it's time for a change. >> Ira let me in. I think the guy still hates me. >> No, I don't think so. So, did you confront yourself ? >> As a matter of fact I do. >> Why don't you-- >> Okay. >> Come on, man, open it up. It's a little gift from me. >> Yeah, he did do this.
