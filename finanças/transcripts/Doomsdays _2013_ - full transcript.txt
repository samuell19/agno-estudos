Somebody broke in. Fuck me. Did you lock the door? Of course I did. Really?! Fucking now? Fuck. Splendid. What do you got? Just lots of beans so far. Pineapples. Lots of bullshit. They got your favorite. - Scotch! - Applesauce. Trade. Want to trade? All right. Hello, we're not in right now, but please leave a message and have a great day. Hey, Joel, I know you're there. Just wait for me, please. I'm coming right now, okay? I'll be there in 90 minutes. Don't do anything until I get there. Horse shit! Horse shit! Fuck! Fuck! Why does this always fucking have to happen?! Fuck! It's your turn. No, it isn't. I keep meticulous records. The fuck you do. Look, I'll go first next time. That is my solemn vow. Bullshit. Solemn vow. Splendid! Yes. All right. So, what do you think? Private home, definitely. Interesting. I say rental. No way. Looky. Look. Rental agreement. How much? 7 grand. What?! a fucking month?! Not for long. How about a little fire, scarecrow? Are you fucking kidding me, dude?! Are you fucking kidding me?! I'm gonna fucking kill you! Son of a... Oh, yes! Yes! All right, this isn't doing it for me. What do you mean? My frustration is massive. We got to go. Where? Anywhere there's a female in residence, preferably a drunk one. You're dreaming. Look, just 'cause you only use or dick to piss doesn't mean that I have to. And where we gonna go? It's 3:30 in the afternoon. My penis will lead us. Fuck! And how will it get us there? Look, I could just hot-wire it with a gum wrapper. No, I won't ride in this. You know that. Couldn't you, just once, refrain from being such an impossible ass? What if whipped cream tasted like mayonnaise? That would be weird, right? Hello, ladies. What are you drinking? Who wants to know? A profane, charmed moi. And I would like to buy you girls a drink. For real? All of your top-shelf dreams fulfilled. Seriously. Whiskey. That's what I like to hear. Make it four. Two for them. Two for me. So... Just in time. This sunshine-y individual is my friend Bruho. Bruho... - Kim. - Trish. Trish. Are you guys vacationing here? We are. It is a lovely town. Ha ha! You really think so? Yes. Quite squalid. Are you... are you renting a-a place around here? We have some real-estate investments in the area. So, how come you're so generous? Buying drinks and all? Burning through my inheritance, trying to prove everyone right about me. What do they say? That I am a solipsistic fuckwad and I don't care about anybody. You talk funny. I sure do. What do you do? Cut hair. I-I go to school. For what? Cutting hair. Cutting hair. Somebody slashed my christing tires! Anybody in here know something about it?! Somebody must! All right, man, that sounds like an accusation. We're just trying to have a couple drinks in here. I think if you go outside and look around, you'll find the culprits. No, sir, that ain't gonna satisfy. So, anyways, cheers. Is your friend gonna be okay? Yeah, he'll be fine. But you guys didn't really do anything, did you? No, of course not. I hope you aren't gonna last forever, motherfucker! Bottoms up. I can't believe you won. It was more of a pyrrhic victory if you ask me. Is he gonna be okay? Yeah, he's fine. You sure you don't mind driving? It's cool. So, then I screamed, "I have sand in my cunt!" And everyone laughed. Hilarious. - Is this your place? - Yes. Although, does something look different to you? Where are we? Our house. Do you remember leaving the lights on? Oh, it's... is that a problem? You know what? My house is much nicer than his. I think we should go there. What? Did you guys, like, invent the Internet or something? The porn part, yes. Wait, am I in a fucking car right now? No, you're just having a nightmare. Go. Go. Okay. I seem to have forgotten my keys. - What should we do? - You know where the spare set is, right? What? The spare set. - Fuck you. - That's your position? I mean... I'd really appreciate it if you... Fuck you! Final word? No flexibility? Welcome, welcome. Sorry the place is such a mess. That's okay. Do you have anything to drink? Plenty. Why don't you make yourself at home? And I'll go fix us some drinks. This is really his house? Yeah, if that's what he said. Sure, whatever. Are you guys in a band or something? That's totally what I was thinking, too. - There you go. Drinky, drinky. - Oh, thanks. One for you. Cheers. Cheers. What is this?! Didn't I tell you I only drink peach schnapps? You had whiskey at the bar. Only because they didn't have peach schnapps. You get used to it. Oh, well, good thing I got this. Splendid. I thought you only drank peach schnapps. I'm willing to make an exception. You guys are really weird. So, you got any other contraband? This... this is it. I've got every wave. What's that? Bath salts. You snort them. - What's it like? - Speed. Do you have enough to share? Plenty. Boy! That has a distinct high note of poison. Oh, I swear it's putting a hole in my brain. Hey. What? Is that... French or... Something? No. I-I'm out! I'm out! I am fucking out! What happened? I guess he doesn't like me. He's got post traumatic stress. From my rack? Sure. Should I go up and talk to him? That would be ill-advised. I-is there anything that I-i can do? You can always share. Share what? Oh, sorry. You're really shit at this, you know that? Fuck you. Jerky beef, two plates, two high-quality porno magazines, one roll inferior-quality toilet paper, toothpaste, but no toothbrush, a Danish, six... soon to be five... Bottles of airplane scotch, and somewhat inexplicably, a sponge. For washing dishes. Right. I'm going to sleep. Hey, Fred. What? Steam roll! Motherfucker. Good night. Best guess? Teenage orgy. Yeah, right. That may be more akin to what I hope is going on. And there goes the main ingredient of that fantasy. Ahoy! Holy shit. Looks like a bomb went off in here. A vomit bomb. I don't think they left us anything good. I bet there's some tabs of acid. Keep looking. Oh. Sorry. For what? Is this your place? Yes, it is. Whom might you be? Kriston's brother. Who's Kriston? Oh, I thought you'd know her. She's, like, popular. What's your name, kid? Jaidon. Jaidon, do you remember all those people drawing all over you? What do you mean? Oh, shit. The weird thing is some of it's not even in English. There was some European dude. "Ich moechte ein bier." What does that mean? "I would like a beer." Great. Awesome. How much did you have to drink? It's not the drinking that was the problem. What was it? They decided to dose my soda 'cause they thought it would be funny. Yeah, awesome. They sound like really charming people. That's my sister's friends. They all want to bang her. Is she hot? Yeah. This isn't your place, is it? That's a wise child. What gave us away? Can you give me a ride? No car. How... did you get here? Walked. Where? Nowhere in particular. We are obliged to walk almost everywhere we go because bruho has an extreme aversion to automobiles. I don't get it. Time to wake the fuck up, kid. I'm out of here. I recommend rubbing alcohol to get that shit off. Thanks. Hey, where are you going? I was... Serious about that ride. What do you think? I say rental. No way. Private home. Or rental. Straight, unlocked. That's good. Holy shit. It looks like you're right. I know. The fridge is fucking packed. You won't believe what I found out here, man. What? What? Motherfuckers have a fully stocked survival shelter down in the basement. Let's fucking raid it. How long do you think they could survive down here, anyway? What, before they started eating each other? Yeah, how long do you think the fucking donner party could live on evaporated milk and sardines? I don't know. Eight months. 10 if they rationed. At least they would die happy. Why? What do you mean? Their whiskey stores are extensive. What was that? I think... I think there's somebody behind that fucking tree. Oh, shit. Sorry. Why the fuck are you following us? I want to join. Join what? You guys. What is it that you think that we do? I don't know. Break in to places? What? He's a persevering little fucker. I mean, we walked eight miles easy. So, what do you think we should do with him? Come here for a second. Stay right there. I mean, having an acolyte might not be the worst thing in the world because he could do all the shit work. I like that. So, we keep him? He has to pass an initiation first. It's the only way I can do it. All right, what do you have in mind? Come on. Ready? One, two, three. - Is that a fire? - No. - It's a fire, isn't it? - No. Do you want to join or not? I do. I do. Then shut up and don't fall off the board. What? Oh, my... Fucking assholes! Oh, come back. You passed. So, how do you pick a house? As in every real-estate market, your chief concern is always location. What's the neighborhood like? How recently has anyone been there? Who might notice? How do you actually get in? Different ways. What about alarms? They're there. Ironically, the house that have signs tend not to actually have alarms. It's when there's no sign that you have to worry. What about police? We're not here by mistake. The nearest authority of any kind is 20 miles from here, so the reaction time sucks. How do you know if a place is, like, a keeper? Once you're safely inside, you can tell pretty quickly if it's gonna be sufficient to your needs... What resources are there? How long can you live off them? What happens if you get caught? Don't get caught. Well, what if you do? Hello. So glad that you're home. Remember lord chesterfield's Maxim... a gentleman can get away with anything so long as he does it with style. Just conjure up some semi-credible bullshit. More often than not, they'll accept it because the alternative is too frightening for them. What do you mean? I mean they'd much rather think it all a big misunderstanding than accept that they're dealing with a couple criminals who have broken into their home. It's a form of denial. Cool. What the fuck are you doing? Come here. Are you ready for this? - I can do it. - All right, go, then. They grow up so fast. Ain't that the truth? That is a sturdy technique. Dude, that one knows nothing. It is quite stealthy for a little-town fella. "We're just here to clean your pipes." There goes stealthy. Dude, there's... That one there... there's... Try the window. I don't know, man. Weebles wobble, but they don't fall down, I guess. That is not looking safe. No, no. This is where training pays off. Shit. - What do we have here? - Unh-unh. No, no, no, no, no. What the fuck are you doing?! Shit! So, what did we learn from last time? Fools rush in? Exactly. Try a little finesse. Okay. Round 2. Nice touch. Good approach. Trying the door. You would be shocked how often those doors are unlocked. But in this case, no. No key. Goes to the window. Right. He's not fitting through that window. What's this? What have I found? Oh! Eureka! Not too shabby. All yours. Get to it. Did you guys find anything interesting? $37. Jaidon? Something called oxy... Contine? And this. There was a machete in there. Yeah. Want to see something even more improbable? Nice! Come here. Yeah. How. What do you think? Should we stay? This house rules. Should we stay? Sure. Fuck it. We're staying. Yes. What's that about? It's just his thing. Am I allowed to do anything I want? I'd prefer it if you didn't stab me in the eye with an ice pick or do anything stupid to draw attention, what Bruho's doing notwithstanding. So... I could do this? Yep. What about... This? Absolutely. Liberating, no? Yeah. What are you reading, anyway? A diary. Whose? Wife of the guy that owns this place. Is it any good? She's having some affairs, so there's lots of extravagant sexual detail. Oh! Really?! Clits and cocks in great abundance. Oh. Well, read some. "His is not at all like Hank's. It's crooked." Really crooked like a boomerang. He also called me Janice in bed. That's not even his wife's name, though I suppose it "shouldn't surprise me that he's done this before." Yeah. Could I... Borrow it when you're done? Thanks! Did I ever tell you guys about that really tall girl I dated? No. She was so tall that when we were nose-to-nose, I had my toes in it. And when we were toes-to-toes, I had my nose in it. No good? That just sucks. I liked it. I liked it. All right. Let's hear one from you. Okay. Let me see. Okay. If you woke up in the woods and you were bent over a log with your pants around your ankles and vaseline on your butthole, would you tell anybody? No. Oh, yeah? Do you want to go camping with me? What, nothing's funny to you? You tell one. I'm not fuck... I don't fucking tell jokes. - Come on. - No, I don't fucking tell jokes. Pussy. Pussy. Oh, really? "Pussy?" pussy boy. All right, you want one? You want one, Mr. funny guy? Yes, that's the idea. - Mr. funny guy? - Yeah. - All right. - Okay. - Guess what. - What? Fuck your mother. - You got to be kidding me? - What? What, do I look like fucking henny youngman to you? You get this... it's a chance to tell a joke. Like... like a chance of a lifetime? Like I want to tell a fucking joke. You just want to be agro about... See? Now, that's good. That's good. That was the best thing that came out of anyone's mouth today. I... need to go to bed. Where's that book? Goddamn it, man. This is all you think about. I'm telling you, man, this shit... Is good, man. You'll go blind, hiawatha. What the fuck is up with that book? It's not something you're interested in. Well, no. Why? 'Cause it's all about fucking. Oh. Great. I don't care. Fucking pussy. I ain't scared of you. Hello? Hello? What the fuck is going on here? Goddamn it, who are you? I might ask you the same question. What? Yeah, I need a name to give to the cops. You... you're gonna call the cops? Yeah, maybe we should call the cops? Oh, okay. Okay. Hey, let's call them. My name is Ronald mater. Hello. I live across the way, and I know for a fact that you don't belong here. Don't anybody move. Do you ever go by Ronnie? What? I think he's Ronnie the groaner. From the diary? Oh, man, you banged this guy's wife, too? - Enough. - She really gets around. Shut up. You know you're not the only one, right? I said... Shut up. We got you by the balls, groaner. Oh, Ronnie. I think maybe you should leave now. Just... don't you stay here. Get out of here. - Ronnie! - You! Quick! Ronnie! Ronnie! Do you think he's actually gonna call the cops? No. But he will certainly call Ms. fucks-a-lot. You mean we have to leave? Yes. Fuck! Shit. How old is it? One or two days. How can you tell? It doesn't stink that bad. Is he dead? No, he's just resting. So, what do you want to do? Give me your knife. Gross! I have a question. Shoot. I understand what you guys do but not why you do it. Sooner or later, everybody's gonna be living like this, or a lot of us, anyhow. I don't understand. Okay, you know about fossil fuels? Duh. What about peak oil? No, what's that? Okay, well, the basic idea is that the world's petroleum is gonna run out, okay? So, prices will spike, no one will be able to afford it, and the world that you know will be over. Because no one will be able to drive anymore? No, no, no, man. Fuck! You see, that's just the beginning of it, okay? Oil's in everything, from make-up to fucking tires to fucking pharmaceuticals, okay? So, not only will things stop moving, but tons of products will stop being made. The entire fucking system will come to a halt, and billions... Mark my fucking words... Billions of people will die. Or adapt. I can't... See any of that actually happening. I mean, is this based off facts? Sure, man. Yeah, it's fucking based on facts, but facts aren't popular. No, everybody likes opinion and rumor, and that sort of shit is in. Isn't there something we could do to stop it? I wish. No! No! Fuck. Wait. Everything okay there, little chief? I was up all night reading about peak oil on the Internet. And? I think Bruho's right. And you know what oil's in? Fucking everything! Okay, okay. I mean, running out of this stuff is gonna be like the apocalypse. Maybe. - Are you saying it's not true? - Not necessarily. What I'm saying is more like, "so, what?" So, what? So, what? All right, if you know you're on the Titanic and you can see that there's not enough room in the lifeboats for you, why not live it up at the bar? I guess. It still sucks, though. Indeed, it does. Okay. Okay. Is that a party? Yep. I got to go reconnoiter. What? I need to practice my French. Should I come with you? Under no circumstances. Yes. Sure. You're really mad. Why are you so mad? Okay, I got a joke for you. All right. Do you know why Irish bean soup is made with only 239 beans, specifically that much, and no more? No. - No, why? - Because one more... Would be two-forty. That's good. You're a fucking idiot. - Boom. - Gotcha. So, Fred here tells me what he does. What do you guys do? Wwait. First, what did he tell you he does again? - Economics professor. - Right. - What do you do? - I'm an entrepreneur. - Really? - Yeah. I invented the, The interweb. Yeah, he's being an ass. He's really my assistant. Jaidon? - Oh, that's my nephew. - Aha! Uncle. So, what do you do? Right now I'm house sitting. Not very noble, I'm aware. Do you have any more beer in your house? I think so. Are you inviting yourself over? Maybe. Please forgive my nephew. He only recently started drinking during the day. - Yeah. - Wait, by... by the way, did, Fred happen to use a French line on you? You mean I'm not the first to hear it? Yeah, I might have used it once or twice as an icebreaker. What did you say? Translated it. What does it mean? It means, "you've shaken the idle nature of my soul." Stuff like that works? Depends on who's saying it. And to whom. Agreed. And myself... something of a sap probably because my mom died when I was young. Really? Mine, too. I was 6. I was 8. - Where are you guys going? - Go find that beer. They're not very sentimental. I am. You sure you guys don't want a ride? No. Jaidon? No, I'm cool. Put your arm up here. In case you change your mind. My powers are significant, bitches. Now what? We could eat some more cheese. Plus that would give us an excuse to go fuck up that guy who was trying to kick us out, right? - That guy's huge. - I know. So, naturally, I won the bet, and stig was obliged to eat a shoe. But no one ever did figure out who vomited all those pine needles. What's your place like, anyway? Why, are you picky? I'm accustomed to the finer things. Ha! I think you'll like it. On the outside, it's 18th century, but the inside's kind of modern. Plus there's an art gallery in the basement. Cultural. Pretty avant garde show. There's no market up here till the summer, so the owner shuts down. There's other places he'd rather be from January to may, but he still pays me to mind the store. So, wait, you have this place uncontested for another month. Assholes of his impose sometimes, but it's rare. You know much about art? No. Do you? I can tell a Manet from a Monet. That's something. Do you have any bourbon? Now you sound like your nephew. We are related. Perfect. Got a name for it? I call it..."Copernicus, fuck you. No, wait. Never mind. I take it back. You were right. I'm coming." Sounds pretentious enough to sell. You think? Anything's possible. What the fuck?! Hot lava, motherfucker! Piss on me? Stop! Get out of here! What the fuck? Dick. So, what do you think they're doing? Who? Dirty Fred and the girl? Are rubbers made from petroleum? Yeah, absolutely. What about lube? No question. Shit. - Hello? - Oh, shit, what do we do? I'll handle it. Hey, there. Really great cabin in... in the woods, itself. It's... it's... It's quite beautiful out here. You guys relatives? Oh, yeah, yeah. You know, we know these... Yo, grab the fucking bag! The what? The bag! Shit. All right, look, do you know how to get there? No. You're angry at me, aren't you? She wrote it on your fucking arm. Do you even remember that? Yeah, I do remember that, but do you remember her drawing a map on my other arm? 'Cause, no, she did not. You are so fucking pointless. What do you want me to say? I don't know the area that well. You know what? You're a fucking idiot. And you're a fucking dick. It's right here. You always drink at breakfast? Whenever possible. It makes the morning a much less odious affair. So, when are you gonna tell me what you and your friends really do? You still think I misled you. I know you have. That almost hurts my feelings. Fine. Why don't we talk about something simpler, like, Where are you from? Virginia. Still have family there? Possibly my father. You know, I never did ask you what happened to your mother. Do you mind if I ask you now? It was cancer. How about your mother? Car accident. Do you not like talking about this? No, it makes me a little uncomfortable. Were you, expecting anyone? No. Okay, I'm gonna go check the window. Just stay. Oh, you guys missed me that much? Yeah, we were really concerned. And we almost got caught. How'd you even get here? Drove. Drove what? Bikes. See what an uncompromising asshole he is? Look, I already punched one guy this morning. Let us in. I'll have to check with the missus, but your timing is especially sucky. Go around to the side. Get rid of that machete. What? Just do it. I'm coming back for it. - Remember my associates? - Oh. Bruho and jaidon. Hey, guys. Hi. Apparently, the power went out at our place. There's a power outage? Our place is very remote. Well, you can stay here if you want. That works. No, no, no, no, no, no. Fuck that. Look, we're not staying anywhere. We're just here to get dirty Fred. Fine, fuck. Do what you want. I don't care. Okay, we got to have a conference. We'll be back. The eggs are gonna get cold. You're welcome. Damn! That rat has been talking trash about me all day, too. Dead-eye over here. Put the rat back up. Put the rat. Hustle. When do I get to shoot? Soon. Just get back down there. So, how long are you planning on staying here? Why, are you ready to go? You know I don't like to stay places where I'm invited. It does feel somewhat peculiar. So let's split, man. Yeah, soon, my man. Soon. In the meantime, try to enjoy yourself. I want to stay. Dick! What, you want more? All right, all right. What's the difference between a tribe of pygmies and a girls' track team? A tribe of pygmies... Is a bunch of cunning little runts. I had this girlfriend who was really tall. And when we were toes-to-nose, I had my toes... No, wait. - Oh, you tell it so well. - Wait, wait. When we were nose-to-toes, I had my toes in it. Is that right? Shit, that's not right, is it? Fuck. How old is he, anyway? Our family is very liberal. Plus, he's been depressed lately. What? About what? End of the world. You think it's coming soon? Very soon. Really? Don't get into it with her. Why not? Because you wouldn't believe him if he told you. You don't think so? No, because normal people like you never do. You refuse to believe that anything is possible. - You think I'm normal? - Yeah, I do. - And you're, what, abnormal? - I guess so. Well, you're certainly fucking rude. Please forgive him. I know somewhere in his idiot brain, he's sorry for his behavior. What is his problem? He's an angry dude. Well... Yeah. Sometimes bruho doesn't play nice with others. Jesus. I do, though. I play real nice. Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Really, really? Yeah. You know, you might be a little nicer, since I'm letting you stay here. I don't want to stay here. You're just a dick. Fuck. Hi! Hi. That's okay. Miss me? - Yeah. - Let's take this inside? No, wait. There's some people in there. What do you mean there's people in there? There's people in my...? It's okay. Get your hands off me. Hey, I'm going inside. Do not... do not... Do not do that, okay? - All right. - Okay, okay, okay. - Chill out. - Here we... hey! Don't you ever fucking hit a fucking lady! - What the fuck are you... - You fucking crazy! Get in your fucking car! - I'm going! I'm going! - Get the fuck out of here! Asshole! Jesus. This is not over, you fucking bitch! You've been there the whole time? Not the whole time. So... I haven't been entirely honest with you guys. No, shit. That guy I'm house sitting for isn't just an artist. - Boyfriend. - Ex... boyfriend. Doesn't know. What's his problem? He's a drunk. That's no excuse. Hey, guys. What's going on? We can't stay here anymore. So, what do you want to do? She can come with us. No, she doesn't want to come with us. Yes, she does want to come with us. I think it's a capital idea. Where are you going? We have no fixed destination in mind. We're like hobos. Pretty cool. So, I'm supposed to break in? Is that gonna be a problem? - Hesitation is not a good sign. - Sorry. I just didn't believe you till now. Okay, now that you do, are you up to it? - I think so. - Good. Now, remember what we told you... no jaidons. What's a jaidon again? Throwing a rock through a window. That was only once. No jaidons. Got it. I-I still can't believe she's here. She'll be fine. - I like her. - Whatever. She's a tourist, man. Once things start going bad, she'll be gone. She might surprise you. Can we never use the term "jaidon" again? Not so bad? Don't get cocky. All right, spread out. Look around. Nothing in there but books. A glass dildo? Got some eggs. They still appear to be pretty fresh. Codeine, ibuprofen. It's not king's ransom, but pretty good for a first house. Shucks. It wasn't anything. Bruho? Say something nice. Way not to fuck it up. Faint praise of a cunt. Jaidon, anything to add? I mean, her track record is already better than yours. Hey, I saved us from Ronnie. And why didn't she have to do an initiation? Good question. What initiation. You'll see. What initiation? This dildo's so veiny. Gross. Don't touch that. Come back here. Just touch it. No! Get out of here! One, two, three. - Shit, this is intense. - Yeah, it is. And hot. Like fire hot. Shut up and stay on the board. Are you serious?! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! What are you doing?! You did it! You did it! Are you fucking kidding me?! Are you kidding me?! Jesus Christ! Okay, so, what is this, some sort of second initiation or something? No, it's just a game. Okay, who goes first? Anybody. Doesn't matter. I nominate myself. Fuck! All right, now what? Now jaidon gets to pick whoever he wants to hit, but whoever he wants to hit gets to pick which shoulder. - Primitive, no? - Bravo. Nice. What, no one's gonna hit me? Pick a shoulder. Jesus fuck. That's how the game's played, my man. And I get to hit whoever? Yep. All right. Move out of the way. Is this legal? No. It's not bad. Not bad. - Yeah? - All right. Who do you pick? - Hey. - Hi. Are you wondering about that? It's kind of hard not to. It's because of petroleum. I don't follow. The world's running out of it. Oh, you mean peak oil? You know about it? Yeah. Is that why you've been depressed? Is that why you think the world is ending? Aren't you worried? Well, yeah, I am, but then I try to be optimistic. You know, there's other things I believe in. Like what? The singularity, for example. What? Well, it's the idea that somehow technology is gonna conquer normal human limitation. So hypothetically, anyway, we'll be able to solve problems that seem impossible to us right now. You think robots will save us? Yeah, maybe. Before they turn on us. I guess in the long run, we're fucked either way. You know I like you, right? I like you, too. All you guys. Although I'm a little worried about that one over there. You know what he's said about you? What? That you're just a tourist. That you won't last with us. Really? Yep. He thinks you're soft. But, then again, he's the toughest one of us all. I wonder. Who wants to go on a mission? What? Vermouth. I bet you these people have vermouth. I second that. You want me to go check it out. Let's all go. What do you even call this? Oh, colonial or federal or American something. How about ye olde school? You guys find anything interesting? Just some personal correspondence. Let me see that. Hey, wait up! Wait, wait, wait. What's that? I don't know. The world's fanciest outhouse? I know what that is. Stop. So... What was that supposed to do? It encourages sweat. The fins invented it. Fins? Persons from Finland. Oh, isn't that where Santa Claus is from? Ha, ha, do you still leave out milk and cookies for that reindeer molester? No, I don't. Oh, you waited by the chimney all Chwistmas Eve. - No, I did not. - And you cwied when there weren't any pwetty pwesents under the twee. I didn't need any pwetty pwesents, nor do I need them anymore. I'm a man, so, not a child. Thank you. Your little back-and-forth routine's getting pretty good over there. I much prefer our little back-and-forth routine, if you know... Oh. Excuse me! What are you doing here?! My friend Stacey... She said we could stay here. She did what?! I thought she told you. No, she did no such thing! Yeah, how long have you and your little boyfriends been partying here? Well, we just got here. And boy... These aren't my boyfriends. Okay, well, the party's over in any case. - Well, shouldn't we call Stacey? - In Buenos Aires. Yeah, it's not like we give a shit what that little whore would have to say about it, anyway. - Scott! - What?! I have two words for you... buenos fucking aires! Whose side are you on?! Do something! All right, let's go! Get out! Get out! Get dressed and get out! Come on! Go! Yeah, thanks. And leave the towels! They're Egyptian cotton! Oh, my god. They were reading our letters! Honey, come on. Let's go get an ice cream. Shouldn't we call Stacey? That was a real kick-in-the-dick moment for me. Such cojones. Well, I was just reading a letter from her. They didn't even notice it was in my hand. Awe-inspiring. - You think so? - I do. You are a badass of the highest order. That's overstating it. No, no, it isn't. You stand up to adversity. You smack it in the face. Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. Keeper. I'd take you home to meet my folks. You mean your father, right? Right. I mean my father. My mother... Passed away. She didn't die when you were 8, did she? It's more of a... Spiritual death? God! Get up. - What? - Get up. Come on. I didn't do anything. Go. Get. Hey, Fred. What... what are you doing in here? She kicked me out. So, he lied to you. Extravagantly. That's what he does. What do you want me to do about it? - Nothing. - Then why are you here? I saw you yesterday. So, I-i saw you, too. In the morning. And? The others don't know about it, do they? I don't even know what you're talking about. How long have you been doing it? Doing what? Did something happen to you? No. You're not gay, are you? No, I'm not gay. Are you a virgin? No. Stand up. Look, I'm not gonna stand up. How do I know you're not just doing this to get back at Fred? You don't. Stand up. Take off your pants. Fuck! Oh, fuck! Are you okay? Oh, fuck! Are you okay? Shit, no! No, I'm not okay! Fuck! She broke her ankle. She broke her fucking ankle, man! - Oh, shit. - Oh, god! Oh, my god! No, no, no! - Can you hot-wire it? - Sure. - So, do it! - No. Why not? Look, you want to drive your new girlfriend to the hospital so badly, you do it. Jesus Christ, you're pitiful. Hey, jaidon! What? Can you drive? I don't know how to. What the fuck do you mean you don't know how to? I'm from New York. Nobody knows how to drive. - Oh, fuck me! - You are kidding me! Are you not gonna drive on principle?! What the fuck do you want me to do? Well, doesn't anyone have a cellphone? I have these many. What the fuck?! No reception up here. Fucking useless! Fuck! Fuck! We went in a circle. So, why are we even considering this? Look, we need a goddamn phone. This is a bad idea, man. We don't have many rules, but this is definitely a violation. - Fuck. - Fuck! Fuck! - Are you gonna be okay? - Yes, just make the call. - Is there anything I can do? - No, just don't... All right, I'll go look for some band-aids. So, how's your ankle? Hurts like fuck. - Hey! Ready for you this time. - Holy shit! Cops are on their way. Sit down. - Surrender. - Where are the others? What the fuck is this, man? Oh, man, I can... I just didn't think that anybody would ever really return to the scene of the crime. - What crime? - Don't get smart, buddy. We... we just needed to use the phone, okay? It's an emergency. Oh, I see. This time it's different? Yeah, it is. Yeah? Yeah, okay, why don't you sit your ass down on that couch?! You guys! You think you can get away with anything! You've been in another house around here, too. I found out. You trashed the car. I have no idea what you're talking about. No idea what I'm talking about? I'm talking about if I put a bullet into any one of you... - Oh, my god! - Holy shit! Get the fuck out! - Come on. - All right. - Okay. - Okay. Okay. Okay. All right, you're gonna be safe here, okay? I'm gonna go find the others. Okay. You made it away okay. Yeah. Do you think I killed that guy? I don't know. Maybe not. I think I did. What do you want to do now? Hey, asshole. I got Reyna, but I couldn't find jaidon. I think you may have lost her, as well. How do you figure? I found this. "Bruho was right about me. I'm just a tourist. Taking jaidon with me. His choice." Fuck. Yeah, I was pretty disappointed, as well, but I think the thing to do now is move on. So, y-you don't even want to bother to go looking for them? No. I'm not driving you anywhere. Oh! What?! Oh, my... Oh, my god. Oh... a-a-are you all right? Are you... Oh, no! Oh, no! I don't... what the fuck?! Where the hell am I?! How do you even know where she lives? I stole her driver's license. How does it feel, anyway? What? Driving. Necessary. Hey, dudes. So, I see you found us. Yeah. What do you want? I came for the kid. What did you come for?
