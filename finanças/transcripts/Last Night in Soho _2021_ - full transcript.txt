Don't you need socks? Socks. This was one of the first times your mum and me went to London. God, the shops. We used to look at all the clothes. Liberty. Selfridges. Carnaby Street. The snooty shopgirls knew we couldn't afford anything, but they didn't know we could copy it. Take it. No, I can't, Gran. Bring her up when I'm settled. We'll have dinner at the Criterion, like in the photo. We didn't eat there. Couldn't afford to. Just took a picture outside and went to a Wimpy. When I'm a big-time fashion designer, we'll go. Deal? I don't think Wimpy still exist. You know what I mean. I know how much you want this. It was her dream, too, but it's not what you imagine, London. Gran. You've got to look out for yourself. - I know. - But I'm gonna say it anyway. - There are lots of bad guys. - You've got to be careful. - There's lots of bad people. - I'll be careful. They're bad apples. I'm scrappy. I can take 'em. I'm just saying, London can be a lot. It was too much for your mum, perhaps, and she didn't have your gift. My gift? She didn't feel things, see things like you do. I... I worry you'll get all overwhelmed again. Gran, it's... it's not just that I need to do this for me. I really want to, for her. And maybe it won't be so bad. Maybe up there, I won't be reminded of her so much. Okay. Besides... I haven't even seen Mum in ages. Bye. You'll call? You know I will. And if it all gets too much in there, you'll tell me? In the city? In here. Please don't do that to yourself. Don't do it to me, okay? I love you. Oh, Ellie. I want us both to be there.

First time? I visited once with my mum, but I was small. - It looks so different now. - It changes fast, all right. But don't you worry, love. It's still the same old London underneath. Good. What brings you down, then? I'm studying. London College of Fashion. So, you're a model? No. I design clothes. Well, I want to. I mean... I want to be a designer. Yeah, but you could be a model, couldn't you? You got the legs for it. So, what's in Charlotte Street, then? Uh, student housing. It's all girls in that building? If all you supermodels are gonna be in Charlotte Street, you'll see plenty of me, don't you worry. You might have found your first stalker. I'll get out here. Oh, no, it's a couple more streets, love. No, I haven't got enough cash. Oh, I'm sure we could sort something out, sweetheart. Plus, it's not good round here at night for young girls on their own. I want to go to the shop anyway. Please yourself. Excuse me. Can I help you? Uh, sorry. Hey, do you want a hand? Fine. You don't look fine. Well, I am. - Are you Eloise? - Yeah. Yeah, you-you look like an Eloise. Well, Ellie. I'm Jocasta. Did they spell your surname wrong or something? Oh, no, I've just decided to drop it because I feel like it's way more singular to be known by just your Christian name. You know, like, so famous in your work that you can actually just go by Kylie. - Minogue? - Jenner. Oh. Okay, bad example, but... how many Jocastas do you know? None. Exactly, babes. You don't mind I snagged the bed by the window, do you? - No. - If we don't end up throttling each other, we could maybe talk about switching next term. Yeah. - So, where are you from? - Uh, Redruth. It's in Cornwall. I'm sorry. You know, Cornwall, in the countryside. No, no, I-I heard you, babes. I'm just, I'm sorry. Uh... what about you? Manchester originally, but I, uh, moved down here in my gap year. Uh, I had an internship at an atelier in Savile Row. Oh, wow. I've just been in Redruth making my own clothes. I had a hunch you made that. Yeah, this is Bouchra Jarrar. Before she sold out and moved to Lanvin, obviously. - Smoke? - No. Is it allowed in here? Oh, I-I just took the batteries out of the alarm. I can go outside if you really have a problem with it. No. - No, it's fine. - I tried vaping. I just think it makes you look like so much more of a cunt. Yeah, totally. So, what does your dad do? Uh, I don't know him. Oh, tell me about it. - And your mum? - My mother's dead. Well, I knew we'd find some common ground eventually. Yeah, I was only 15 when she died. What about you? Seven. Oh, wow, that is young. Although I guess it's maybe easier at that age. Not that it's a competition, though, is it? Ooh, fresh blood! Oh, my God, wow, is that a bloody Bouchra Jarrar? Oh, good eye. Yeah, well, before she sold out and moved to Lanvin, obviously. - Yeah. - Obviously. Oh. Oh, this is my roomie, Eloise. Hi. Yeah, she literally made the outfit she's wearing. How amazing. All of us turn up in our Sunday best, and she's here rocking her own design. I'm thinking we should call her Brass Balls Ellie. And what will we call you? Oh, well, by tomorrow morning, you'll know me only as Hurricane Jocasta. Ooh. So you guys know each other from before? Oh, yeah, we go way back. What is it, like 15 minutes? Yeah, something like that. We're in the Dead Mums Club. - Oh. - Fuck leukemia, am I right? - That's awful. - Yeah. It's pretty shit. I'm not gonna lie. But, I don't know, I feel like it kind of fuels my work. - So... - Mm-hmm. What happened to your mum? Uh, she wasn't well... mentally. She... she killed herself. Sorry. We shouldn't have asked. It was a long time ago. - You're, like, so brave. - So brave. Yeah, I had a-a great-uncle commit suicide... hung himself. Oh, God. So, yeah, I know exactly what it's like. Also so brave. - So brave also. - Yeah. Mm. First rodeo, Ellie? Got to mark your territory, babes. - Ooh. - Oh. Time to break out the big guns. Let's really get on this bitch. Do we really want to be hungover on our first day? Oh, hush. That's future you talking. You know what, fuck her. You've got to live in the now, girls. So, hos... ...to Soho. To Soho. To Soho. Come on, Ellie. Keep up. You're gonna love it! Let's go! I dated an Irish guy twice. Well, like, the-the same guy but, like, two separate times. - Oh. - Yeah. Yeah. And, yeah, he was Irish. Yeah, and, I don't know, I kind of feel like I kind of get the culture. Watch and learn, guys. And I just love Ireland. Like, he literally introduced me... Um, excuse me, miss. Um, my dick just died. Can I bury it in your arse? - Ew, absolutely not. - Get away. That's disgusting. Oh, you should try that line on Eloise. I bet she's complete filth once you get a few drinks inside her. Okay. Okay. What? - Oh, come on, play the game. - Aw. - Ellie. Freshers... they're a blessing and a curse. It's just a bit shit. I'm just like... She's such a code beige, I'm getting these, like, born-again Christian vibes off her. Who, Country Mouse? She comes to her first day at LCF wearing clothes she fucking made. Yeah, that was a bit much. Bringing up her mum's suicide... I'm sorry, but, like, who the fuck does that for attention? - Yeah, right. - She's a bit weird. She's a lot fucking weird. I'd lay bets on her slashing her wrists before Christmas. You can't say that. - It's true. - Jocasta! Come on.

I can't wait to come down and see you. - When you feel more at home. - Yeah. When I feel more at home. Soho 0827. Hi. I saw your advert for a room to rent. Yes? Uh, I'd like to rent it. Do you know Goodge Street? Uh, no, but I can find it. Well, it's 8 Goodge Place. Press the buzzer for Collins. Just coming, deary. - Ms. Collins? - Yes. It's Ellie. We spoke on the phone. Oh, yes. Room is on the top floor. I've a few rules. Don't take smokers. I don't smoke. No male visitors after 8:00. Not a problem. And no using the laundry room at night. It rattles right through to mine. - I don't do laundry. - Eh? I mean... I don't do nighttime laundry. I do do laundry. I'm very clean. Good. It's a bit old-fashioned for some, but I won't do nothing to it. If you don't like it, you can find somewhere else. It's perfect. I love it. Bed, kitchenette, bathroom. You won't have to worry about it until the summer, but then you'll have to keep the plugs in 'cause all the smells rise up. How long have you lived here? Oh, a long while. I used to work here, cleaning and such, back when round here was a bad spot. I bought it for buttons off the old owner. Must be worth a lot now. Oh, I could never sell it. Too many memories. Yeah. If I could live any place and any time, I'd live here in London in the '60s. It must have felt like the center of the universe. I hope you know what a landline is. Some of your lot don't. - Course. - Don't get too excited. It only makes emergency calls. Oh, and I hope you like garlic. Yeah. There's a French bistro next door. Pretty soon, you won't be able to smell anything else. So, when you looking to move in? As soon as possible. You're not in any trouble, are you? No. No, I just need, uh, an escape. Oh, don't we all, deary. What's your line of work? I'm a student, but I have a loan and a bursary. Well, what do you study? Fashion. Ah. Interesting. Yeah. My gran's a seamstress, and my mum is... was in the industry, too. And you're sure you'll be able to make the rent? Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'll make it work. I do ask more than your average landlady. I want two months rent in advance and two months deposit. - Okay. - I've had people just take off in the middle of the night. That's why.

He manages a lot of girls. Well, hello there. The bartender said I should get to know the handsome fella standing next to Cilla Black. You should. And you are? The next Cilla Black. Are you, now? Well, you know, she started out as a coat check girl. You willing to work your way up? Of course. What can I get you to drink? It's Sandie, and I'd love a Vesper. James, we'd love a Vesper. So, what do you do, Sandie? Well, I sing, of course. How's your dancing? Care for a demonstration? Here we go. Your thoughts? You're already a star. But you could be an old lady before you get onstage here. How about I get you a gig somewhere this week? - You could do that? - I could, indeed. But first, let me get your Vesper. - Do I get a dance now? - Afraid not. Oh, you looked up for it just then. I'm just waiting for my friend Jack to get my drink. - Well, I'm sure Jack won't mind. - I mind. Now, don't pretend you don't love the attention. Is this man bothering you? I was just asking our friend Sandie for a dance. Her card is full right now. That's all right, old chap. Don't hog her all night. You're the only hog round here, old chap. Now, don't be a cunt about it. You can keep your little whore. What did you call the lady? She's a slut, mate. Look at her. Come on. Least I can do is drive you home. Oh, what's the most?

Carol says he was a right ladies' man back in the day. Probably thinks he has a shot with you. Do you believe in spirits? What kind of a question is that? That brown stuff pays your wages. I mean... do you believe in ghosts? Ghosts? No. Why? Are you scared down here? If this place is haunted by anything, it's the good times. When it's empty, all I hear is the laughs. Every gangster, every copper, every red-faced lush has been in here, and all those high spirits have soaked into the walls. You could probably get drunk on just that. Yeah. Ellie, I love you, girl. You fit right in. But you can't sleep here. Come on, they're waiting for you! - Hey! - Don't touch me! Oh, shut up, will you?

We all pay for a broken mirror, deary. Ms. Collins. Did a girl live upstairs before? Lots of girls have lived here over the years. Someone called Sandie? Lots of girls have lived here over the years, and not all of them with their real names. Why do you ask? Did someone die in my room? This is London. Someone's died in every room in every building in this whole city. Every street corner, too. Oh, and speaking of which, I would have killed your gentleman friend last night if I'd caught him, so count yourself lucky, broken mirror or not. Where you going? Where you going? Where you going? Where you going? Where you going? Where you going? Where you going? Good morning, Ellie.

Where you going? Where you going? Watch where you're going, girl. These are the kind of men that you need to keep happy. Then maybe it's too late for you. Don't you ever disrespect me! I'm talking to you, blondie. This is London. You look familiar to me. Did he hurt you? Just so I've got this straight, you-you witnessed the murder last night, but you believe this was a vision from the past, the murder of a young woman in the mid to late 1960s by a man you believe to be her pimp. Yeah. You're an art student, correct? Uh, fashion. Have you ever taken any hallucinogens? Acid, mushrooms, mescaline? We're not gonna get you into trouble if you have. Yeah, I know it sounds crazy, but I'm not on drugs. I don't take anything. You were at a party before. Could somebody have slipped you something? Maybe somebody bought you a drink? Get these down you. Uh, no. No, it-it... it started before last night. When I was sober, I saw landmarks in my dreams, details of nightclubs, places that I'd never been to before, and then I saw those details in real life. I know something bad happened to this girl, 'cause I have these visions, these visions of the past. Ever since I moved to London, I keep seeing Sandie. Th-That's the murdered girl. Have you only been here a short time? A few weeks. London, well, it can be a lot. Maybe it would help if you spoke to someone. Look, please just listen to me! Is there a history of s-schizophrenia or mental health issues in your family? I know who the killer is. It's her boyfriend, uh, and her pimp, Jack. I've seen him in the present day. Look, there's this man I've seen around Soho who follows me. The first time I saw him outside one of those models places, he didn't take much notice of me, but he did suddenly take notice when I changed my hair to the same style as Sandie's, the murdered girl. What, this hairdo? Look... look, my point is I've seen Jack. I've seen the killer as an old man around Soho. Can you narrow down "around Soho"? He drinks at The Toucan. I think we've got all we need. And then she says the... the killer drinks at The Toucan and-and narrows it down to me, you and the whole rest of Soho. Yeah, I'm sitting there thinking, "This is complete bullshit, darling." Miss Turner. Miss Turner, don't go. I'd really like you to stick around. What do I need to do to convince you I'm not crazy? I don't think you are. I just think you need a bit of help to settle in. A-A support system. You've done the right thing. Please hear that, okay? And I will look into Sandie's murder, and I've got your contact details, so if anything comes up, I'll be in touch. Thank you. Though I will say, in such cases, especially this old, it's hard when you don't have something concrete to go on... even a last name. I want to look up murdered women, uh, missing persons in the Central London area from 1960 to 1969. Aren't you a fashion student? Yeah. Yeah, it's research. You're doing some cool fashion shoots based on infamous murder sites or something? Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly right. - Killer. - It is. Hey, Ellie, I got your... Jesus, John! Why whisper like that? It's a library. Right. I have your stuff. You ran out. Uh, left your bag. Everyone's here, cramming for the test. Listen, about last night. I mean, if I did something wrong... No, you didn't. Sorry, it's not about you. Then... what is it, El? You'll think I sound crazy. Talk to me. Last night, I saw something. In the bedroom, from the past. What did you see? A girl was stabbed. There's a girl that used to live in my room... Sandie. The guy that killed her is still out there. So I'm looking for murdered women and missing persons from the '60s to try and find out her name. And if I don't, I'm gonna lose my mind. Maybe I already have. Feel free to run a mile now. Listen. My auntie believes in all sorts of weird shit. So you just tell me how I can help. Well, I guess you can start with the next year of boxes: 1966. Damn. This is just one year? London's a bad place. Library will be closing in 15 minutes. That was quick. Fuck this! Did you see that? Ashley, she could have fucking killed her. It's okay. It's okay. It's not fucking okay. What the actual fuck?! Security! Stay here. Jocasta! Jocasta, wait! Security! Stop! Jocasta, it was an accident. An accident? Are you fucking kidding me? Security! What happened to me? What happened to me? What happened to me? What happened to me? What happened to me?

I'm talking to you, Sandie! Leave me alone! Jack? Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Where the hell have you been? I've been covering you downstairs for the last hour, for fuck's sake.

They're always around somewhere. - I'm right here. - Aren't you just? I'll have a pint of Numbers, love. - I hear you were quite the ladies' man. - Were? How dare you? Still am. You never lose it. You knew a lot of the girls round here? A lot of 'em? I knew all of 'em. Sandie? Who didn't know Sandie? ♪ My Eloise-a ♪ ♪ I'd love to please her ♪ ♪ I'd love to care ♪ ♪ But she's not there ♪ Do I scare you? No. I knew all the girls. Like to think I looked after 'em. Had to keep them in order, too, mind. Keep 'em in line. Sandie, she was special, though. She didn't belong. I thought she was too good for it. But, you know, at the end of the day, you all look the same on a slab. I know what you did. I've done a lot of things, Eloise. You're gonna have to be more specific, love. I know what you did to Sandie. - Do you, now? - Mm. Yeah, I saw her. I see her. I know what happened. Well, whatever happened to Sandie, she brought it on herself. But no one deserves that. Listen. I know where you live, Eloise. And I don't know what you've seen or heard, but I can tell you Sandie ended up exactly where she wanted to be. Funny you mention her, though, because the first thing I did when I dragged myself back to this miserable smoke was to look up her old bones. But turns out some people don't want to be found. But you killed her. You think I killed Sandie? I know you did! Ha! I think you'll find Alex killed Sandie. Come back. Nah. I've had enough of this line of questioning. You think she was an angel, but don't be fooled. I'm recording this. You won't get away with it! So what? I do what I like in this manor. The police know! I told them! Like I give a flying fuck. Look, wait! When you see Alex in whatever little hell she's currently in, you tell her I said hello. Oh, my good God. Jesus. - What happened? - He just stopped in-in the middle of the street. Oh, Lindsey, you poor bastard. Call an ambulance, pet. Now! And tell 'em he used to be police. - That'll make them hurry. - Right. Okay. Lindsey? - He's police? - Yeah, he's ex-vice. He used to be a copper in Soho for years and years, working the red light district, and now look at him. Then his name's not Jack? Jack? No, love. That's Lindsey. Yeah, he looks very bad. I reckon you're a copper or something. I reckon you're a copper or something. Do you, now? Do you, now? I'd get out while you can, girl. Ellie? Ellie! I've let you down. I've let Mum down. You haven't let anyone down. - You never could. - Okay. Ellie, I don't know what's happened, but it's okay to come home. You haven't failed anyone. I'll-I'll come and get you first thing tomorrow. No, Gran, I can't stay another night. Well, uh, I'll get someone to drive me now. Ellie? - Ellie? - Hello? Hello? Look, I have someone who can help. - El! - I'll call you. Ellie? Eloise? - Ellie! - John! John! Ellie. Thank God. I saw the flashing lights, and I thought... I'm scared here. I'll take you back to yours. No, I want to go home. Home, home. I-I need to get out of London. Can you help me get to the train station? Forget the train. I'll drive you. You have a car? How else am I supposed to get to North London from South London? Right, I'm gonna go in there, get my things and never see that fucking room ever again. Do you want me to come up and help? No, better not. Ms. Collins would probably kill you if she sees you again. Maybe if I plead, she might give me some of my deposit. Fuck. If I'm not back in 15 minutes, maybe come check on me. Okay. Ms. Collins, it's me, Ellie. Just coming, deary. You look like you've had a fright. I need your help. Just you, is it? Yeah. I'll put the kettle on. Come in. Your music upstairs got me breaking out my old records. Oh, I picked up a letter of yours by mistake. It's in that pile. Don't judge me on the cigarettes. All that hoo-ha last night got me going again. Sorry. Oh, it's not your fault. I was always on the edge of starting again. So... How can I help you? Ms. Collins, I-I'm really sorry to do this. I-I didn't want to be this person, but I'm leaving tonight. Oh. Are you, now? I'm not having a very good time here, and I... I really need to go back home, and I promise... I promise I'll pay you for the mirror, - but I really need some of my deposit. - Slow down. I don't want to beg, but this has been a disaster. Hush. Slow down. Drink your tea. You went to the police, didn't you? About the room upstairs, hmm? Yeah. A nice police lady came round asking questions about you. About your well-being. Welfare check, she called it. Had me worried. You'd been saying a girl died up there. - Sorry. - Oh. It's funny 'cause... there is some truth in it. I hadn't thought about it until you brought it up, but... a girl did die up there, I suppose. The young me... ...that came to this big city. Sandie. I had hopes and dreams like you. I wanted to be a singer. I wanted to perform. To act. Being a whore is a bit like being an actress, I suppose. You have to pretend you're someone else. Someone that's not you. I'd pretend I was somewhere else. It's too late for you. That this wasn't happening to me. MS. COLLINS and SANDIE: Try and forget all those... all those men. Their faces. I'd blank them out. I had to. Make like they were nothing. So, yes, you could say Sandie died in that room. She died in that room a hundred times. And then one night... ...the man who put me there... ...the man who put me to work... ...the man who stole my dream... ...well... ...I put a knife in him... ...a hundred times. And do you know what, Ellie? Oh, I can call you Ellie, can't I? Yeah. It felt right, Ellie. All those bastards who came ringing my bell, creeping up my stairs, they sent me to hell, so... I sent them to theirs. The papers call them missing persons. As far as I'm concerned, they were already lost. So they don't know where they are. I say they didn't know who they were. I was doing everyone a favor. MS. COLLINS and SANDIE: I wasn't gonna be used anymore. I wasn't gonna let this city break me. I'm so sorry. Why? It's not your fault. No, I mean I understand. I know what you've been through. Oh. Do you, now? Yeah, I didn't mean to get you in trouble with the police. Oh, it's all right. They think you're mad. And it's not like you're gonna tell anyone else. No. No, I'm not. Of course not. I-I would never. No. I mean... I know you're not going to tell anyone else. Oh, don't worry. I'm not gonna stab you like the others. I wouldn't do that to you. No. You're gonna go to sleep. And everyone will think you just topped yourself because, you know, they all thought you were going to do that anyway. They're all very concerned about you. Bless. So, you... just get comfy, and... you can doze off listening to some of that nice music of yours. No more excitement for you tonight. Just you, is it? Little liar! No. Just coming, deary. What is it? Um, I'm here to see Ellie. She's upstairs. Come on in. Run! John! Will you keep it down! Enough to wake the bloody dead! Ladies and gentlemen...
