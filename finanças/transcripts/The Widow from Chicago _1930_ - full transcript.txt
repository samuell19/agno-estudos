Morning paper. Big scandal. A big scandal, folks. Morning paper. Read all about it. Read all about it. Good morning. - Good morning. Oh, She's moody. Who is she? - The new tenant. Far be it from me to cast any inflexions. But it don't look respectable. She taking an apartment at midnight and moving in with a man with a suitcase. Married, ain't she? - Well .. You can draw your own delusions, Mrs Armitage. But he carried the suitcase. Oh, Jimmy. Oh, have a heart. Come on, flatfoot. Collect yourself. Where do you get that flatfoot stuff? Listen, Jimmy. If you sleep all day you will be right back in that uniform. Oh yeah? You talk the commissioner didn't know what he was doing .. When he promoted me out of that uniform. Hello, Jimmy. Jimmy Henderson. The newest and best detective on New York's police force. And I'm afraid he is going to make good. If you can tear yourself away from that mirror I have got something to show you. Is that the story you wanted them to hand out? Word for word. I practically wrote it myself. Now what do you think of the kid brother? You are taking an awful chance, Jimmy. No kidding. It's a cinch. Only Finnegan and me saw him jump. Listen. That was no escape. It was suicide. It doesn't say so here. Certainly not. That is all phony to mislead Dominic. Listen. When we got orders to hop on that train. And pick up Dorgan before he arrived. Finnegan and me waited until late at night. Dorgan was sitting in the observation car all alone. Reading. No-one else was around so me and Finnegan strolled casually in. All of a sudden Dorgan looks up and spots us. He dashes out on the platform just as we're going over a bridge. Before we can stop him he makes a dive over the side. I jumped back and pulled the stop cord. And all of a sudden I noticed .. This bag that Dorgan left behind him. Now, will you stop worrying? But suppose they find him? It would take a week to identify him. And all I need is three days to get the goods on that Dominic bunch. It is a set-up, Polly. I've got all of his papers. In that bag? - Sure. Listen. None of Dominic's bunch had ever seen him. They sent for him to come and do a job. Last night when I walked in on them. I got an ovation from that bunch of gorillas. If you put this over you ought to get one from the police force. If? Well, last night in two hours I heard almost enough to convict them. Now, will you stop worrying. Will you? Maybe some of the older guys on F-Squad won't burn up .. When a new man like me steps in and comes through on his first assignment. And another thing. - Say. How do you want your eggs? Fried. I can't eat them raw. The shells get in my teeth. And another thing. I wouldn't be surprised in if they hand me a few extra dollars a week if I .. How many? Oh, maybe five or ten. I mean eggs, you big flatfoot. I haven't time for breakfast, honey. Well, This is a fine time to be telling me. A couple of the Dominic bunch said they'd pick me up outside at 8:30. I am going to eat with them. There is a reason. A secret conference, huh? You said it. And something tells me I am going to get a big earful too. Oh. Be careful honey, will you. Don't worry about me. I can take care of myself. I know you can. Hey, Jimmy. [ Gunshots! ] - Jimmy! Let me have him. You are alright, kid. Oh, Jimmy. [ Buzzer ] "Johnson is coming up with two guys." How are you, Johnson? - Where is Dominic? He's in the office. - I want to see him. Sure. I'll take you to him. Watch it. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Hello, Johnson. What's on your mind? You know what's on my mind. Sit down. You are excited. I told you to keep your men out of your place. Why, were they up there again? - You know they were. Last night. I don't know why they were up there. You don't buy my stuff anymore. No. I don't buy it. Preston don't buy it and he Moon Caf? don't buy it. None of the joints up there buy your poison. They're making a mistake. Not as big as you are. Now, you keep your men downtown. That's final. - Yeah? And what if I don't? When the next one that is found in my territory .. It is just too bad. Now look here, Johnson. I don't want any trouble with you. - Well then, you watch yourself. Now, this town is big enough for both of us. We understand each other. We don't have to get touchy. We can always talk things over. You tell those men to get their hands off the Roman candles. Now listen, Dominic. I don't want to bust in to you like this. But you must learn to use your head. - Why, sure. I'll learn. Have a cigar. - Sure. Now I will do the talking. Get those hands up! You nor nobody else in this town can tell me where to get off. And all your fast talking don't faze me a bit. Now get out and get out quick. Come on, turn around. Go out like nothing has happened. I don't want to embarrass my patrons. Watch him. You Palooka. A little dignity from you dames. I am the manager of this joint. Ha. Through the teeth or the gums. Lookout stomach, here it comes. Why don't you two try and get along, like me and Mazie? Huh, baby? You tell 'em. You tell 'em. The trouble with you is you are too suspicious. Friendship not built on a foundation of honesty and sincerity is bound to flop. Ain't it? You ought to know. Women give me a pain right where I live. Yeah? Why don't you move? That's a great idea. - Wait a minute, mister Mullins. How about the key? - Hmm. It is a pleasure. That ain't my key. But Mazie's. Hey. I want to talk to you. In private. Come in here. Oh. Excuse me, Dominic. I didn't know you was in. Next time, knock. Sure. Sure. Mazie and me had a little falling out. I was just going to take her in there and give her a piece of my mind. Well don't do it. You can't spare it. What did I hire you for? To dance with the fellows. Then stick to that and don't be so ambitious. Alright. So don't pull any bloomers around here. Around here? You are too optimistic. Where is Mullins? - He is at a table. Johnson was just in. Yeah? I want the boys to lay off his place for a while. What is the racket? I don't know yet. Swifty Dorgan not showing up has kind-of spoiled my plan. Yeah. Everything has gone flooey. Get a load of little Romeo. He just kicked off a balcony. What's the matter, didn't the horse come in? Nah, it is Cora. She makes me sick. Well, you guys will learn if you live long enough. Women and business don't mix. You've got the right dope. Why, it don't pay to be serious with a dame. Why, in the future .. I ain't even going to look at another .. Ah. Company. I don't think I recognise her. You ought to. You got a good look. I wonder who she is. You ain't lame, are you? Hello, baby. How do you do. Introducing none other than Slug O'Donnell. The East-Side whirlwind. Now don't be like that. What would you take for a little dance? With you, I'd take arsenic. Smart little cracker, ain't you. On your way. Excuse me, lady. Is this fellow bothering you? Not exactly, he just spoils the scenery. Beat it. If anyone bothers you, just let me know. Are you the proprietor? Well, practically. I am his right-hand man. How odd. I just knew you were something important the minute I laid eyes on you. I am not surprised. Other women have told me the same thing. But I don't pay any attention to it. You would. You are just the type that has a lot of resistance. Maybe so. But I know when to time it. I wish you were the proprietor. - Why? I came here to talk business with him. - Did you? Well, you can talk to me. It all amounts to the same thing. A little crowded around here, isn't it? Yeah. Let's take a table. What will you have? You want a drink? - Of what? Ginger ale, cider, malted milk? Say, is he trying to kid me? Why, you've insulted the lady Tommy. Beat it. Who's the little bozo with indigestion? Shush Not so loud. What's the matter, do you know him? - Yes. And he has got a very bad temper. Who wouldn't have with a face like that. Quiet, will you. He's looking right at us. That is all he has been doing since we sat down. He is so dramatic. Look at him. He looks like the heavy in "Way Down East". Ha-ha. Ha-ha. You know, we only laugh at things around here when they are funny. I beg your pardon. Have we met socially? Furthermore, the women that come in this place act like ladies. It must be amateur night. Listen. She doesn't know you, Dominic. Dominic? Are you Dominic? What if I am? Nothing. Only you sure got a swell press agent. He builds you up as a giant. And here you can chin yourself up on a curbs tone. What's she doing here? - She has to see you about something. She don't have to. She has talked herself right out of it. Go on, start moving. Come on, Mullins. But listen, I am .. - Get out on the street. Did you ever hear of Swifty Dorgan? Hey. What do you mean by that crack? What do you care? You don't want to talk to me. What do you want to speak to me about? I want to see you about a job. What made you think I'd give you one? Oh, something. What? You sent for Swifty Dorgan to turn a trick didn't you? He didn't show up. Is that right? How do you know so much? Are you his girl? No. Wife? Widow. Hey. Come in a minute. I read in the newspapers that .. Dorgan got away from some officers by jumping into a river. Don't tell me you fell for all that junk? When .. When my Swifty .. Hit that river. He .. Oh, he never came up. That is a great act, sister. But I don't believe you. No? - No. You would believe your own handwriting wouldn't you? There is the letter you sent him. Recognise it? If you hadn't sent that thing .. I would still have my Swifty. Oh, give me that. I managed to get along before and .. I can do it again. Now wait a minute. Hey, Mullins. Fire Mazie. When do I start? You are working now. What do you want to talk to me about? When are you going to let me take you out sometime? Why? I don't know. When you can think of a good reason, let me know. You know all the answers, don't you. You have to in this racket. Tell that bit over from Chicago I want to see her. Shall I wait until this dance is over? No. Right now. And bring Mullins with her. I'd be delighted. Hey, Mullins. Dominic wants to see you. Both of you. Come in. The next time I see you dancing with one of the girls. I'm going to throw you right out on your rear. You are supposed to run that floor out there. Now see that you work at it. Alright. - What did you say? I said. Alright. Well, go ahead. No. Not you. Sit down. Men fall for you, don't they? There has been a few exceptions. Did Swifty ever tell you why I asked him to come on here? No. He never discussed his business affairs with me. And .. I never was curious. You were smart. That is the first nice thing you've said to me. Dominic. Now you are not smart. All that hooey you pull on the other guys don't go with me. You win. You know Johnson? Chris Johnson? Is he a sailor? No. The Johnson I mean runs The Big Caf? uptown. Oh yes. I know who you mean. Well, him and me are in the same business. And there isn't room for both of us. Now get this. You and me are going to have a battle. - What? It's not going to be on the level. I am going to fire you. And you are going to make out you hate the sight of me. Why? Because you are going up to Johnson's and getting a job. How do you know he'll give me one? He'll give you one. Just to pump you about me. And you are going to spill plenty. I am not. Yes you are. Because I am going to tell you just what to tell him. Hey. Hello. Save it, kid. I ain't seen you in about eight years. But that face stays with you. - Ha-ha. Brother, it stays with a lot of them. Look, we heard you'd cashed in .. - Hold it. I'll explain later on. Say, you got a nice joint here. A lot of swell-looking dames. Yeah. But that won't do you no good. No? - No. Watch me. - Your wife is here. What? Your wife is here. Look. Some dish. You still know how to pick 'em. How long has this been going on? - Oh, she blew in a couple of weeks ago. All broke up about you being missing. Dominic felt sorry for her and gave her a job. Not bad. Dominic is a good guy that way. Say, where is this guy Dominic? - In his office. With your wife. And will she be glad to see you. I'll bet she will. Come on. I'll take you to his office. Now, is there anything that you don't understand? It's a cinch. That guy Johnson will be putty in my hands. Now don't kid yourself. It is not going to be so easy. If he gets wise it is liable to be boom-boom. [ Door knocks ] Who is it? - Slug. Can I see you for a minute? - I'm busy. It's important. Wait a minute. What is it? Do you know who this is? Who? Swifty Dorgan. How do I know you are Swifty Dorgan? And how do I know you are Dominic? Wait a minute. Don't go off your nuts. We had some trouble a couple of weeks ago with a guy who said he was you. Come in minute. Swifty. Oh, Swifty! Alright, Slug. I'll take care of Dorgan. Swifty, I've been worried. Oh, why didn't you write to me? Why didn't you wire? I thought something terrible had happened. Serious. I couldn't baby. I had to lay low. I broke a couple of ribs in that fall. Come on. Pull yourself together Mrs Dorgan. Why don't you take her home? Yeah. Maybe I had better. She seems a little upset. Go ahead. I'll phone you in half an hour or so. Come on, baby, Let's go. Forget about that Johnson deal, Mrs Dorgan. Your husband can take care of that now. I will phone you later. Come on. Say, what's the idea? - Oh, Oscar. I want you to meet my husband. Glad to meet you. How do you do. Oscar has worked for Dominic for a couple of years. Where can I see you tomorrow and talk this thing over? Why tomorrow? What is the matter with right now? - I don't talk business in my bedroom. No? Hey, give me that. - Lay off. Get away. Go on. Out of the way, babe. Now what is the idea of this "widow "racket? Must I explain? It is the oldest game in the world. Who are you trying to take? Dominic? Who else? You are a cute little trick, aren't you. Open that door. Don't be silly. Give me the key. The widow. The widow Dorgan. Stop it. Cut it out, you. Now, baby. You let me alone. Now don't be like that. No. Where did you get my grip? Where did you get my grip? I said, where did you get my grip? You little stool-pigeon. Talk and talk quick. I'll tell you. I'll tell you cheap little swell-headed crook. That young cop that run you off the train was my brother. So that's the game, huh? A wise cop sends his young kid sister down to the job he is too yellow to do. Oh shut up! He is .. dead. Ah, quit balling. What happened to your brother? You left your grip on the train. He said you were killed. He ran to Dominic's and made out he was you to get on the inside of the racket. And he didn't get away with it, huh? And the next morning one of Dominic's crowd killed him. And I am going to find out who. You must be off your nut. You are going to Dominic's now, aren't you? Can you guess what for? Sure. To squeal. - That ain't the right word. I am going to warn him. For his own good as well as mine. I believe in giving a guy a break. Did Dominic give my brother one? Dominic is different. You are just like him. How? You are not giving me a break. - Oh. I can't afford to. A dumb cluck like you. Running around and spilling everything you hear to cops. That's a lie. The police don't even know where I am. I am only after one thing. I'm going to find out who got my brother. And as far as the rest of you are concerned .. I don't care what you do. Baloney. [ Telephone ] Hello? Yes, Mr Dominic. Let me talk to Swifty. Sure. Go on. Squealer. Do your stuff. Hello? Dominic? Yeah. She is feeling much better. Thanks. Yeah, I'll be in tomorrow about 2 o'clock. Say, Dominic. I want to tell you about Mrs Dorgan. Yeah. We just had a talk. She won't be down to work anymore. No, not that The Palace ain't a nice joint. But a dame like Polly is sort of .. Out of her element. You understand. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Thanks. So long. And you gave me a break tonight at Dominic's too. Thanks. That's alright. Forget it. Just my romantic disposition. So here is what you are going to do. You are going to go back to where you came from before you get hurt. It's lucky for you that you ran across a good guy like me .. Before you stubbed your toe. You won't be able to fool Dominic. Now, in the morning .. You .. blow. I don't want to see you again. You are going to see plenty of me. What? Don't forget that Dominic thinks we are man and wife. And he had better see a whole lot of us. Together or .. You might have some questions to answer. Now, think it over. Well, it is rather a spot. You are a smart girl. Not half as smart as Dominic is suspicious. You'd like to get me bumped off, right? That's up to you. Here is what you are going to do. You are going down the back stairs and through the alley. In the morning you are going to come up the same way and take me to breakfast. Now, get out. Go and find yourself a room someplace. This is just like being married. Mr Johnson. Good evening, Mr Rothman. - Good evening. Certainly. George. Please. Yes, sir? Have Pierre come up and bring his list with him. Yes, sir. I'll have it well iced for you. Fine. Oh, Helen. Just a minute, Georgie. Say, you got a lot of money in there tonight, haven't you. I'll say I have. I don't get a chance to bank over a holiday. Not here. How about stepping out with me again tomorrow night? I have got stay here and pay off. Got a big load of stuff coming in and they don't take checks. Well. Goodnight. Evening news! Evening papers. News. Boy, let's have one of those papers. - Yes, sir. Here you are. Thank you. Evening paper. News. Evening paper, folks. Read about it. Read about it. The big stand-off. What are you doing here? - That's a nice reception. Don't you think you ought to kiss me? How does it look? Perfect. Turning out just like you said. Have they got much on hand? - Plenty. They'll have more tomorrow too. It's a holiday and they can't bank. They got to pay off on a load of stuff coming in. Alright then. It's tomorrow night at midnight. I'll have the back door open promptly at twelve. Okay. Where will I drop you? At the flat? No. I've got to get some things for breakfast. You'd better let me off at this market. Hey, Oscar. Pull up here at the market. Give me 15-cents' worth of tomatoes. Say, how do you happen to be out with him tonight? I phoned and told him to stop and pick me up. Don't you think you are overdoing it? Give me 10-cents' worth of apples. You know, you'll play up to him too much and he is going to get wise to you. He is probably that way now. You know, I think he is falling for me at that. Don't be silly. Well, alright. Well, get your hands out of your pockets. Come on, here is our bus. Hurry up. You know, last night I kinda wished you were with me. Did you? - Yeah. You'd have gotten a kick out of seeing that blond cashier fall for me. Is she good looking? Fair. Pretty dumb though isn't she, to go out with you. She knows what time it is. The trouble is that a girl is at a disadvantage when she is with me. She just can't help falling for you, huh? It isn't that. It's just I have everything that makes a girl forget her better judgement. I'd buy you a hat if I could get one big enough. Thanks, Swifty. You sure make a swell errand boy. Don't go in for a minute. I want to talk to you. That's all you have been doing, isn't it? Come here. Sit down. Well, I suppose you know that after the job tomorrow night I am .. Hopping a rattler for out of here. What for? Well. I don't want you to think I'm going to get effeminate or anything. But maybe I might get a job and go to work for a living. I guess you will be glad to go, won't you? Say, you know I am .. Sort-of getting a kinda funny feeling for you somehow or other. Sort-of like a guy does .. For his cousin maybe. Boy or girl cousin? I don't know. Sort-of like you are one of the .. Family. Oh, my tomatoes. Say, why don't you buy those things in cans? Look at my tie. Will you go. You've done enough damage for tonight. Don't go in yet. I want to talk to you some more. Some other .. That's funny. I must have gone away and left my door unlocked. Well, think over what I told you. Not tonight, Romeo. Go on. Hello Polly. Dominic. Where did you come from? I got here just a little before you folks. The door was open so I thought I'd take the liberty of coming in here to wait. Where is Swifty? Oh he .. he went down to the corner a minute. For cigarettes. Maybe I can stop him. Swifty, Swifty! No, no. Don't call him. I'll wait until he comes back. I am not in a hurry. Well, won't you sit down? Thanks. Well, you got a nice place here. You and Swifty. We think it's kinda cute. Do you want to see Swifty about something important? Why? Why .. I just happen to think he might not be back right away. How far is this place where he buys his cigarettes? Well. I don't know which one he'll go to, but .. He stops and plays pool sometimes. That's alright. I'll wait. Sure. You haven't got tonight's paper have you? No, but you can get one at the corner maybe. Hey, you're not trying to give me the rush act out of here, are you? Don't be silly. What makes you think that? Well, a lot of things. What's the idea of locking this door? You know, I .. Hello Dominic. What is going on? What do you mean? She never locks that door. What do you think? I am trying to steal your wife? Eh, Swifty? What a chance. Dominic wants to see you about something, honey. Yeah. I just wanted to tell you that if Johnson is there tomorrow night. Don't stand near him. Some of the boys don't like him. Thanks. So long, folks. - So long. Hey, Swifty. Have you got a cigarette? Luckies. Thanks. - Keep the change. So long. - So long. When did he start smoking cigarettes? About five minutes ago when I told him you went after some. It's a good thing I saw his car parked in the alley. It's a good thing you came up when you did. Dominic doesn't trust you. - He has got to. Oh kid, you are going to get hurt. Don't worry about me. You watch your step getting out of here. Go on. Lock this door. You and your suspicions. I'll do anything you say, Lieutenant Finnegan. Only I hope there is no shooting on account of my customers. Now, everything is going to be alright Johnson. You just leave it to me. Dominic's gang will blow in here about midnight. I think you had better take a ride through the park. Get back about 12:30 and it will all be over. You little fool. What are you doing here? I think I will have some consomm?. - When I have cleaned things up. Yes, ma'am? Do you recommend the turkey? - It is very fine, madam. I think that will do for a start. Very good, madam. One minute to go. Get 'em up! Up! Turn around. Keep 'em up. [ Gunshot! ] [ Gunshot! ] Say, what happened here? - What happened? He's shot. Get in that other car with Oscar, Swifty. That was a dumb thing to do. I didn't know what I was doing. I lost my head. Let me alone! Snap out of it. Here, give me that gun. I'll get rid of it. Come on, get out on the dance floor. You been here all night, see. Sure. - Sure. We never go anyplace. You'd better have a drink, babe. It will straighten you out. I don't need one now. As soon as Swifty gets back we'll talk things over. Talk what over? - You just bumped a cop didn't you? Did you ever hear of a thing called an alibi? Well, you had better have one. We had all better have one. - You'd better get one yourself. Somebody might want to know where you were around midnight. What do you think I came back here for? Hello, Mr Dominic. - I haven't seen you in some time. Gloria, take good care of him, will you. He is a particular customer. Hello, Joe. Central 7,000 Sergeant Dunn. Hello? Sergeant Dunn? Polly. Stay on the phone. No, I did not. - You did so. You are crazy. - Don't say that. I saw you. Don't give me that any day of the week. Slug. What's the matter? I just saw this mug putting lead quarters into the slot machine. I tell you I didn't. I've stood here watching you for 20 minutes. I ain't been around here 20 minutes. - Now look here, son. I wouldn't do that if I were you. It's not going to get you any place. Honesty is the best policy. Come on. Outside, egghead. Say, Benny. What time you got? Forty minutes after twelve. You are a little fast, aren't you. You have been here all evening, Mr Dominic. Why did you do that? You killed him. Are you crazy? Keep out of this. - You did it for me. I didn't do it for you. Get that out of your head. Polly, I'd go to jail for my whole life rather than you do a thing like that. Shut up. Things are bad enough without my having to listen to your whining. Don't stand there staring at me. You don't have to stay here. I don't mean to whine. I know you didn't know what you were doing. Just as you don't know what you're saying now. I want to help. Save yourself the trouble. When I want your help I'll ask for it. Polly, you're in an awful mess. What is this I am mixed up in? A small-town racket? You aren't nothing but a cheap crook. Get out. The sooner you leave the better. You make me sick. Make you sick? Make you sick? You heard me. Get out. Hey. Come here. What happened down there? I went down like you told me. I unbolted the door and it opened. Suddenly, I felt a gun in my ribs. I turn around and there is a cop. I'm a smart guy so I stick 'em up. You were smart alright. You likely shot your mouth off to that cashier there. Or the cops wouldn't have got wise. I did not. I never talk around women. - You don't talk? That's all you do. Gab, gab, gab. Your tongue is hung on a hinge. I send a thousand miles to get an entrance man and I get you. I could have sent an 8-year old kid down there and got a better job. Yeah? Well, listen. - Now, shut up. Now get this and get it straight. I haven't got any use for a swell-headed mug like you. You are just a little bit too clever for me. Now, this is the last time that I want to see that handsome pan of yours. Do you get it? That goes both ways. Right, get out of here. Alright. I'll get out but I'll keep on going too. You won't see me anymore. I'm through. Do you hear? Through with all rackets and everyone in them and that goes for you too, Dominic. You talk too much. And that goes for me too. And get this straight once and for all. The sooner you leave the better. Have Oscar drive you to the station. They are alone now. Dorgan has left. If it doesn't work this time it is just too bad. All we had to do was let Dominic rob Johnson's. And then grab him. Go to all this trouble and take a chance Dominic gets away just for a robbery? I should say not. This is a matter of police honor. We think that Dominic killed an officer named Henderson. If we could prove it, well .. Do you understand? I get you. You sure made a mistake by bagging a bird like that for a husband. I made a mistake alright. He is not my husband. No? We were never married. Well, very few are nowadays. Either way, it won't make any difference to us now. No difference that I can see. I didn't think it would. You know, you and I are going to make a pretty good team. Yeah. A great team. You like me a little too now that Swifty is out, huh? Do you happen to know why Swifty is out? No, and I don't care. I'll tell you anyhow for your own information. He is out because I found I have been wasting myself .. On a cheap small-town crook. I fell for him, just like I might fall for you. But I am not going to make a fool of myself twice. You don't put me in the same class with Swifty? I'm not taking any chances. I'm leaving. Hey, wait a minute, baby. You are talking to a guy named Dominic. You are talking to a girl who's wanted by the police for something serious. It is not even. You have got plenty on me and I've got nothing on you. I see. That's why I'm heading for the big town .. Where the gang I travel with can furnish plenty of references. References? - Goodbye. Maybe we can get together a little later. Say, I don't think you got the name straight. It's Dominic. Have you still got it straight I am wanted for murder? Yeah, I know. References. Did you ever hear of big Jim Cassidy? Yeah. I heard he got killed. Well, I heard of it before he was killed. Did you ever hear of Red Murray? Sure. Who cares? Another mug. I killed a cop and got the whole department chasing me. I ain't through the list yet, baby. Did you ever hear of a cop named Henderson? Jimmy Henderson? Yeah, that was his name. Jimmy. Jimmy Henderson. Did you ever hear of him? Yeah, I heard of him. Come to think of it, I got here while he was impersonating Swifty. References? Boy, I got them. Henderson. - Henderson? That is enough for me. Gerry. Call up the squad and two cars. I'm going right down there now to pick him up. Right, Captain. You stick right on it and takes notes as long as he gives it to you. Understand? I don't like the looks of that. You don't suppose they are headed for Dominic's? If they are they are sure headed in the right direction. I can't leave that poor kid back there all alone. I'm going back. Turn around, Oscar. Well, now that we understand each other baby, we'll step outside and celebrate. I think I'll go. See you tomorrow. - No. Tonight is the night. I'm taking you down to Mike's to throw a party for you. Not tonight. Oh, sure. - What you going to do? I'm going to call and make a reservation and say I'm doing some business. Wait a minute. I want to talk to you. - We'll have all night. Hello? Hello. What? I wasn't talking to anybody? Who was I talking to? Who? No, no. That's alright. I don't want to talk to him. Stool pigeon, huh? I don't know what your game is but you're not getting .. [ Buzzer ] "A load of cops coming up." So, you're working with the police, huh? In the alley with you. Come on. Finnegan. - Sure. I thought she shot you. - Yeah. With a blank. Nice work, Miss Henderson. - Henderson? Yes. Jimmy Henderson's sister. You are a guy that don't talk much. Get 'em up, Dominic. - Alright, alright. There he is. Hold it. People will get hurt. Quiet everybody. Quiet, quiet! Quiet, quiet everybody. Quiet! Sergeant. See that every window and every door is blocked. Okay, Chief. - Brian. - Yes, sir? Get up on those spots. Now listen everybody. There won't be any shooting. I want the lines to be orderly. I want you to form a line and come through this entrance single file. Take it easy. Come on now. Don't rush. Take it easy. Come on now. Easy. Not you back there. Hold it there. Not too fast. Don't crowd over there. Come on. Take it easy. [ Gunshot! ] [ Gunshots! ] Listen, Dominic. I want you to come out and give yourself up. You can't shoot it out with us. We are too many for you. Careful with that spotlight. [ Gunshot! ] That's his fourth shot. He's got two left. - Unless he's got another gun. It looks like he's heading towards the office. Who's covering it? - Wait. Which of the boys is the best shot? Norton is pretty handy with a rifle. - Good. Have him near the main entrance. And when I say "now". The boys will flood the office door and if he is there .. Let Norton give it to him. Yes, sir. Now! Norton, hold it! Get that light off me or I'll let her have it. Get that light off me! Get away from that door, Finnegan. Come on, beat it. You haven't got a chance in that alley, Dominic. I've got plenty of men there. If you think the alley is the only way out of here you are crazy. Come on, baby. Ride along with me. Where are you going, Dominic? I had to come back for you, kid. I couldn't leave you up here all alone. Finnegan. I had to do something to win Dominic's confidence and make him talk. And I thought I was a smart guy. Captain. They'll probably make you Chief for this. - Yeah? Nice work, buddy. What is your name? Swifty Dorgan. You wouldn't kid me, would you? Swifty Dorgan is dead according to our records. He was killed jumping off a train. Bring him outside, boys. They are going to put you on probation. - I suppose you fixed that too? Come on, let's go. Sure. I'll go. Well, get going. I'm going. You know, handsome. Don't forget to invite me to the wedding. You'd better make it soon. I may not be here very long. Up the river. So long. Say. You know, that wedding is not such a bad idea at that. You want me to fix that too? No. I think l can take care of that. (-sd-)-
