It's past midnight. Monday, September 15th, has begun. The name day of Maria and Nikodem. I hate Mondays. I HATE MONDAYS I hate Mondays. I HATE MONDAYS I like Mondays. 0:03 a.m. Oleś! The arrow! We're working on it, officer. No worries. 2:17 a.m. 5:29 a.m. Bolek, you have no idea how much I hate Mondays. You have to start all over again. If it weren't for the bloody TV instalments, I would have dumped this milk gig long ago. From now on everything is going to be fine, you'll see. - I have an idea! - Yeah? Listen. - I go first. - Okay. And collect the empty bottles and make signs with chalk. - Okay. - You take the lift to the top floor... go down and place the milk on my crosses, get it? No, no, Boleczek. Well, maybe it's a good plan, but let's not try new things on Monday. Ma'am, there's no program at this hour! Boy oh boy, do I hate Mondays! 6:01 a.m. 6:11 a.m. Crikey! Can you take me to Maszynohurt on Kasprzaka street? Get in. Where to? Maszynohurt on Kasprzaka street. I only go to Grochów. Crikey, what do you mean? You told me to get in! What do I do now? Get lost. 7:05 a.m. I can't stop in front of the building. There's a sign. 30 zlotys. Damn it! I'll get you! I'll know your voice when I hear it, asshat! Look! The guy from TV! Master! Autograph! 7:30 a.m. Jacek, get back here! Jacek, come back this instant and finish your breakfast! Did you hear me? Just you wait! I'll show you! Trouble again? Don't go up there, you'll get a piece too. - Didn't eat your breakfast? - You wouldn't eat it either! Mum made noodles from the plaster you hid in the cupboard once. Remember? Come here. Chop-chop! She's on edge. They're having a smoke break. - Stocktake. - Smoke break! Check if she's in the window. - She's not. - Leg it! 8:00 a.m. - Hello. - Hello. I'll know him when I hear him! Good morning. He's not getting away. If I get screwed over on Monday morning... Hello. Good morning. The whole week will be like that. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning! Morning, morning. Morning, boss. - Crikey, save our plan, sir! - Wait. We don't have any combine rose joints. - Maybe at least the half-inch ones? - None! - Look somewhere else, on your own. - Will you sign the refusal? What the bloody hell, man! Oh, sorry! - Morning. - Where's the flag? It was here! Good morning. Okay, okay. I'll sign the papers. Morning! Lovely weather, isn't it? - Great start on Monday. - But, my dear ma'am... I swear to God, I just put it there. I was barely doing 50... - 50 zlotys. - You! There you go. Crikey, that's heavy! Crikey? - A little prankster, aren't you? - What's this now? I have it! - You took off the flag? - Me? Rubella! Kindergarten closed until further notice. Headmistress. What does it say? Hop on. Polish Airlines flight 256 from Cairo and Athens will land in Warsaw around 12:00 a.m. Polish Airlines flight 246 from Rome with the connecting flight to New York is about to land. Not yet! Wait for the mark! 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... You lecher! Ladies and gentleman, I will show you to your planes. Please put out your cigarettes. Please! That goes for pipes too, sir. Now? Your attention, please. We are about to land in Warsaw. We kindly ask you to faster your seat belts and refrain from smoking. Please fasten your seat belt. Commercial and technical counsellors at 11:00 a.m. - 11:30 Coffee and cognac. Flowers? - Ordered. Will be here any minute. Has the legal counsel looked through the deal? Yes, sir. - No mistakes in the Italian version? - None, we checked. - What's next? - At 12:00 p.m. the Italian. - Then, dinner with the minister. - Have you ordered pasta? They told us to go to a milk bar for pasta. - What do they give Italians? - Pork chop and cabbage. Sir! Mister Chairman, flowers! - Why have we stopped? - Sir, would you press... Press it yourself. Sound the alarm or something. - It's stuck again. - My plane leaves in 30 minutes! - It's stuck! Hello! - Open it! Open! - Open it! - Call the lift guy! We start with melting the gelatine. Put it on steam on a kettle lid. Meanwhile, beat the egg yolks and put it aside for a moment. Now, beat the whites of five eggs. It's good to add a pinch of salt. The froth will be stiffer. If beaten well, the froth stays in the bowl. Now, pour in the yolk mass and quickly stir everything together. There, the lemon cream is now ready. TV DAILY Good morning. It's the first edition of the TV Daily. Let's start with local news. The whole country is battling the effects of a prolonged drought. The builders join the fight vigorously. This month they are likely to fulfil the year's quota of 350000 flats. What the heck? You again? Mister craneman! Craneman! What? Get down! The lift you installed in Maszynohurt broke down. They... Turn this thing off, will you! They've come from the union! Stop snooping around! How many times have I told you! Craneman! You gave me the crane keys, but where is that helper of yours? I haven't seen him today. He's probably sleeping somewhere. You know how it is. He works nights as a milkman. He's paying off instalments. Live and live. - Gentlemen, you're blocking the road. - Alright, alright. Again? - The keys. - Oh, sorry. Excuse me. The battery needs charging. Hey, why aren't you getting in? I never drive when I'm plastered. Move the car to the other side of the road. You can't park here. Why are we running? We left the car there! That car was no good, grandpa. Sit down here. Look at the pictures. I'll get us another one. Remember. You promised me three events today. - We'll be late without a car! - We'll make it, grandpa. You'd better hurry up! Please stop for a moment. Those at the end, please come closer. - We'll go together. - Jędruś. Come here. You ask them if she can spot him. Your Reverence. Your Reverence. The chairman is concerned... whether the lady will recognise him. You'll recognise him when you see him? Of course. Mrs. Kowal affirms that she remembers him well enough, for as a young boy he would visit her garden to collect apples. - Grazie. - You're welcome. The old bag is talking rubbish. Your designs and our work will be the warrant of... Mr. Dudziak, I can't read your scribbles! What warrant? Remember, gentlemen... - We play after the highlanders. - After the highlanders. After the highlanders. You got it? Play after the highlanders. Play? I should've been at the airport half an hour ago! I'll sue that mechanic's ass! It's the third time this month! He says he'll sue the mechanic. It was you who installed the lift, wasn't it? I installed, but I didn't build it. It's a prototype. Looks like it's a faulty one. I unlocked the machine. Nothing else I can do. Missing fuse. - Missing fuse. - A fuse is gone. - A fuse is missing. - I knew this would happen. Stolen and sold on the private market. What will the foreigners think when they find out! For Pete's sake! The plane is landing! Do something! Get another mechanic! Do something! - Call for another mechanic! - Another? I'm the only one in Warsaw who knows these lifts. Search if you want to, maybe you'll find one. Best of luck. - The mechanic feels offended. - Offended! That's enough! He can't fix anything, and then he's offended. It's over. - Morning. - Morning. Excuse me, yes. I'm going to report you! I'll teach you a lesson! Hell of a teacher. Teach yourself not to press two buttons at the same time. Hey! Excuse me! Which one is it? This one? - Sam! It's him! - Is it him? - It's him! - Play! Play! Hey! Welcome home! God bless you, son, for remembering the faith of your forefathers. I got it wrong. - It's not him! - Not him? No! Stop playing, stop! It's not him! Stop it! Not yet! But we were supposed to play after the highlanders! I'm sorry, a mistake. Welcome! Greetings to our contractors. - Welcome. - There you go. Welcome. Hello! Polish Radio. How was your flight? - First time in Poland, sir? - Yes. It's a huge pity. Huge. Sir, have you seen the picture of this new school? Sam, it's him, it's him! Play, gentlemen. Play. Come on! We've already played. Now it's their turn. Play or I won't pay you! I need an alibi. - Is this the bag? - Yes. What inspired you to donate the savings of your forty years abroad to the building of a Polish school? I wanted to... It's a long, long road From America to Poland Hello, my friends Hello, my friends Cheer up! I'm back home Our work will be the warrant of... And who's going to pay a fine? Didn't you see the red light? Your documents, please. Stay calm, sir. Indicators. Could you cover for me for a bit? Kindergarten's closed. Wife's at work. I got no one to leave him with. Sergeant. Master Sergeant. Here's my party ID. It's a matter of national importance. Every second matters. Do you know who is waiting for us? That's not my business. My shift's over. There you go. Master Corporal, it was no big deal, I swear. It was for the greater good. You have your greater good and I have mine. The kindergarten was closed. - How am I supposed to work? Put it on! - And your wife? - She couldn't take the day off. - Grandma? Nope. That's unfortunate. Grandmas are perfect for this kind of thing. Forget grandmas. The Italian is waiting! Shall we take the kid for a ride? - We're going to the airport. - Wanna see a plane? Let's go! - A-45, A-45. - This is A-45. 45-40 ready for service on post 13. Thank you! Copy that. I couldn't leave my kid in the kindergarten. Rubella. - I got no one to leave him with. - Wait a second. Krystyna, see if anyone's free. 70-37 reporting car theft. 70-37, stand by with that car. Sorry, everyone's busy. Sorry, you have to wait. Nobody's free. Attention 70-88. 70-88, report back. - 70-88 reporting. - To Sergeant Kubicki. - It's for you. - It's me. Władek, tell grandma to pick up Jolanta from the kindergarten. There's rubella. Will do, Marysia. You're late today. Fifteen minutes. One of your guys wanted to force me into a car. - Rehearsal or home? - Home. Senatorska street. - You go that way, I go this way. - This way. We have to find him, yes. Check in the luggage, please. Hi! I'm in a hurry. Will you drop me downtown? - Get in! - Thanks. - I'll get my luggage. - Okay. See that guy? He was trying to break in, the scoundrel!! You know, sir, this one looks better than ours. See that? In a parking lot, too. How was your flight? Shaky? - Where are we? - There. - There? Let's go, then. - Wait! The boy is missing. Greetings! Thank you for the flowers. Please, there's enough room. Luggage goes in the boot. - He said... - It's not him! - Not him? - It's not him! What's up? What's wrong? You said you'd drop me downtown. - What, me? - Of course. Warsaw sure looks nice. You only leave for a while and it's all changed, eh? How long have you been abroad? You were supposed to show me a real plane! Kids these days... A Mercedes doesn't do it for him. He wants a plane. They always have fresh beer. Come on, drinks on me. Two, please. There you go! I got a flat yesterday. Loggia, Swedish lifts, rubbish chutes. Called for a celebration. We were going till the morning. If it's serious, I can help you push it over. You can't stop here. Nice kid. Does a beer show up on a breathalyser? Sure it does! They haven't shown me the plane. Tell them to take me there! You didn't go to the airport with them? Nicely done, bringing up the boy. Take your stuff. You, you! And then I got into another Mercedes. It looked better than ours. - A-45, A-45 - This is A-45. It's A-45-40. The one with a kid. Lieutenant, have you... Leave it! - Have you found someone? - There are difficulties. Please wait. It's hard to control traffic. I have to keep an eye on my son. Stay where you are. Understand? And don't move. Got it? Dear officer, I'm in a hurry. - They have toilet paper at the Junior. - The red light? It was red, but the paper will be gone soon. There's a boy on a motorbike. Mum can't take care of him. You'll watch him for ten minutes. But... I'm running out of... - You prefer a ticket? - No, no... - Is there something left? - Not much. Not much... Officer! - Please let me go. - Tell him something! A story. Entertain him! What? Maszynohurt? No way! I'm going the other way. To a workshop. Bella. Come here. By my leg. What do you think you're doing? Are you advertising something? I don't have my glasses. I bet it's another washing powder that ruins underwear. Are you Italian? Spaghetti? - Italia. - Italia... Before the war, there was a Café "Italia". In 23 Nowy Świat street. They served delightful Turkish coffee. Lardelli was Italian, too. He had a bakery opposite the main station. God! What ice-cream! What cakes! Honestly, you came to the right place. I will show you everything in Warsaw! So Warsaw was once called... we were once called the Paris of the North. Warsaw was always a beautiful city. And the princess was very upset... because there wasn't a single roll of toilet paper in the whole palace. And everyone in the kingdom had already stocked up. So she took a few hours off and a terrible monster caught her. And what? What about the paper? 10 minutes! Officer, I'm in a hurry! Do you see that kid on the bike? Can I? What happened with the princess? You know, it was just a run-down little house but the mustard was exquisite. That skyscraper, sir. 16 floors they built. Children pee in the lifts because they're so far from home. Back in the day you could take a walk peacefully, on the road... No asphalt. No noise. Bella! Bella! Stop it! The whole kingdom was overcome with grief and sorrow... for their warehouse ran out of rose joints. The High King himself called the Prince and said: Mr. Bączyk, ride to the capital or our plan goes to shit. - That's not a story! - Corporal! It's been ten minutes! Corporal. The Youth Traffic Service is at your command. We'll make sure nobody crosses the street in the wrong place. - Do it. - Be prepared! - Is this the Sales Department? - Yes. It's for you. Thank you. I'm looking for combine parts. The lady has left, and I only deal with transportation. But there's nothing that can't be done for a nice client. Shout with me, sir. - Mrs. Ku-ba-siń-ska! - Mrs. Kubasińska? Yes. One, two, three. Mrs. Ku-ba-siń-ska! What do they want? Tell them there are no rose joints anyway. - Where? - Kilińskiego street. Get in! Władek! That's the guy from the airport! Władziu! To the car! Dad! Dad! Come! Come here! Jacek, go back! Go back on the bike this instant! I need to pee. It's A-45. Yes? - I need to pee. - Is this a prank? - Who's this? - Jacek. Daddy is on the road and won't come to me. Jacek? Wait a second, honey. Hold on! Attention! Attention! To all the units downtown. A-40 reporting. We're in Nowy Świat street. Go to post 13 immediately and report that the son needs to pee. A-40, do you understand? Hello? - Pee? - Do it! - It's very urgent. - Yes. - Hurry up! Go! - Yes, sir! Floor it! Unfortunately, it doesn't add up. One is missing. What's worse, a foreigner. - It can't be! - And yet there is ullage. Everything's always added up! Maybe we missed something? Let's try again. You count them, sir. - Single widowers: 18. - Yes. Shy with issues 73. Marriage bureau. How can I help you? Joasia, it's for you. Husband. Yes? Joasia, I know you're stocktaking, but there's rubella in the kindergarten. Jacek couldn't stay, and I can't leave the post. You have to help me. Did you hear me? I am, I am. But I have an ullage. - Shit. A lot? - One person. A man. - One. - But a foreigner! I'm sure it'll sort itself out. Don't cry, Joasia. I can handle it. - Bye. - Bye. - Hello! - Hello. I made it just in time and bought one for you too. Here. Your wife will be happy. Ma'am, toilet paper is the last thing I care about today. What a day! I hate Mondays too! Don't worry, everything will be fine tomorrow! It can go up to 120! - No, I think it's in miles. - Nice springs. What's the matter? Maszynohurt. - The rest looks like English. - Let me see. "Machinery" means machines. - Export, import. - Yeah. The rest is in English. - You said you know English. - Not these words. Gentlemen, his car has broken down! Shall we help? Sure! Get in! Get in the car! Hey, you! Come here! You'll push with us! Watch where you're going, jackass! Your wires are wet, hence the short circuit. Water's still dripping. Give it. Don't bring it up. What a dreadful day, this Monday! I'll have to replace them. See for yourself. Come here! Who did this to your bucket? I've been driving a taxi for 30 years now and nobody fooled me like that asshat. Me! An old Warsaw taxi driver! Cheated like this! We need the ramp, but it's busy. You have to wait. Józio! Put that bloody Triumph down! Okay! - Hello! - Hello. - Do you have quarter-inch rose joints? - What's that? - A combine part. - We only do cars. A combine looks like a lorry. I thought you might... Only cars. - You can go nuts! - You're right! But I'll get him one day. I won't forget his voice, crikey! - Crikey, where am I going to find it? - Crikey? Get back! Get back! There must be order, right? Maszynohurt? I'll find you some rose joints you'll never forget! Wonderful ones! There you go! Rose joints! You wanted to have a go with me? Be my guest! - Get on the ramp! - It's fine, Miecio! What the... It's not him! - Were you at the airport an hour ago? - When the plane from Rome arrived? - Let's say I was. - You won't believe what just happened! You took a man with a child. Don't deny it! There are witnesses! So? Is helping people forbidden now? - Maybe I'm just a nice guy? - Exactly! What have you done with him? The minister is waiting for him! - It's a matter of state! - And money! Where is he? Nothing to worry about! I'll drop you right at the station in the evening. A gentleman on the road is a pedestrian's friend. But the road isn't your pasture in Grójec, jerk! Watch it, you road hog! I'm not from Grójec, I'm from Sulęcice! I'll write to a newspaper about what you did! I remember your numbers! Crikey! Crikey? I'll get you, you little... Comrade! Comrade! Comrade Corporal! We arrested one. A highly undisciplined individual. We had to whistle at him three times. Alright, alright. I know your tricks. You're all in a hurry or in trouble until you get hit by a car. Then they'll say it's the officer's fault. That's right! It's all on us! Traffic service! That's right. You have to think about your kids. Your wife. Do you have a wife? A wife. You have one? - Nice lady! - Sure she is. All Polish women are nice. Gorgeous. Dazzling! Polish girls are bellissime ragazze! I'm arresting him. There you go. Your reward. - Be prepared! - Be prepared! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Two apiece. 12:00 p.m. Help! Chaps! Help me! Help! Craneman! Władek! Craneman! Lunch break, boys. Lunch break! - How long will you be here? - An hour or so. I had to leave the intersection. Be right back. He's a foreigner. Take care of him - when he's out. - Okay. After you. Number 371. He loves the rush of space and morning jogs on wet grass. Romantic, restless nature... But without violent outbursts. 372. A stay-at-home, with a sensible, realistic attitude to the world. - He enjoys good food and TV. - Exactly, TV. They'd watch TV all day if they could. So what hobbies should the candidate have? - Well, I represent union trades. - Union trades? I don't follow. - We have protection of profession? - We do. Well? Close your eyes, sir. Can you smell it? - Sex. - Sex? That's the name of the fragrance. It's a new one every week these days. And I have to sit in these smells for eight hours. And I'm so intoxicated and so... aroused. I filed a complaint at the Works Council. And they told me it can only be a Southerner. Maybe a Spaniard? Sir, they're not the type who run barefoot on grass in the morning or watch TV in the evening. - Hello. - Hello. And? - Not yet. They're looking for him. - You're good. I brought you one. - Nice, eh? - Is he real? Absolutely. Not a word in Polish! This is my... My wife. Wonderful! Tell him that the sergeant at the door will look after him. Goodbye. Thank you. Please have a seat, sir. - Francesco... - Rovanelli. Joasia, I tried to reason with her. She insists on a foreigner. Ludwik, the client is always right. She is, but we don't have a foreigner! Prepare the ambience, please. Okay, boss. This gentleman comes from Italy. - I'd prefer a Spaniard. - Then you'll have to wait. We already have bookings for the third quarter of the year. Your decision? Can I take a look at him in daylight? You always have the right to make a complaint. Just sign this. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. BUY ONLY IN MHD! Let's go. Warsaw's a friendly place Warsaw's a friendly place Here you will find happiness But you just might lose your heart A capital, as you know Needs no words to describe it Broadly speaking, strictly speaking And all other kinds of speaking Not even the great city of Paris Can really begin to compare Because everyone knows that... Pardon... - You were to stick to Chmielna street. - Don't be like that, officer. You won't miss a magistrate court this time. Be a good bobby! "Play, Beautiful Gypsy." They played it on my wedding. It'll bring you luck. Happiness! True happiness! Even though it's Monday! We earned a bonus and fulfilled the plan. Get on, Kasia! I met my Gienia in autumn too. Have you bought your Toto ticket? You're impatient! You Italians! Come on. No need to wait any longer. Yah! Get on! You're in luck! Literally, at the last minute! We're about to close admissions. - Name. - Zygmunt Bączyk. - What district? - State Machine Centre in Sulęcice. Room 4. The list is closed. Don't let anyone in. Nice, ha? Intense. Exactly! Well said, sir. Intense. - And engaged. - Engaged? Yes. This isn't a regular wrench. - A four-inch 19. - Exactly. This, together with the vertical elements, symbolises the perennial striving of the human being for modernity. Rose joints. God Almighty! Rose joints! Quarter-inch ones! Is this yours? Do you like it? Do I like it? It's marvellous! This is what our workers are waiting for! Look, it's my delegation. They sent me to the capital. If come back without it our plan goes to shit. The farmers will delay the harvest! Farmers too? Naturally! I'm from the Machine Centre in Sulęcice. 37... Oh, joy! 38. What should I write on the check? A check? You've restored my faith in humanity! Three years I've been doing this for nothing! And now builders, even farmers, can't work without it! So how much for it? Oh, nothing. Nothing. I always wanted to make art for builders and farmers. Take it for free. Thank you, sir. - Do you have a car? - A Syrena. Syrena? Then come to Sulęcice. We'll renovate it. For free. Thank you. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Finally, something genuine! Yes. Simple. Stark, even. Sincerity of expression. Truth. - You wanted to take the day off. - Not any more. But what about the till? There will be no shortage. FOR A LADY RENOVATION! May-be... - You're late. - I had trouble parking the car. - Where did you leave it? - By the post office. You'll find it. I parked near a shop with a painted window with a "Renovation" sign on it. You're wearing it wrong! We need to look like foreigners! In Poland, nobody frowns upon a foreigner. Maybe we could put it off? It's Monday. Are you mad? It's the 15th. People are paying instalments. Come! You have to keep them at least for a minute, so I can make it to the car. We're out here looking for him and I bet he's in the office. Got a coin? Now what? To the post office! OCTOBER - THE MONTH OF FRUGALITY Who believes in savings? Hand up! Who has a savings book?

So much trouble, but it ends well! Saviour! My beloved! Saviour! Gentlemen! Will you take care of our countryman and his luggage? You know what is inside. Come with me. Excuse me! They don't have food like this in America. Of course... Delicious. One for the road, son. We have to go. They're waiting for us at the school. Down the hatch! When I would go for a drink in America, I told myself: frost, stop it! There's no vodka here. You're not drinking this crap. Better put this dollar away. That's how I made a fortune. There was business, but here... Here it was empty. Empty? There you go. My artery yearned for all this. Then take another shot! Yes, yes, I will. Good, very good. Thank you. Ladies and gentleman, the party's over! Our schedule says we should have been there by now. Finally. We've been looking for you in the whole city for an hour now. Your passenger is in the restaurant? I'll go and get him. Stay here. They're coming. We're lucky. It didn't take long to find you. This is the money. The whole sum. Nothing's missing. Sir... I'm happy that I can shake your hand. Not many people like you these days. This way. I screwed up. A real professional doesn't start anything on Monday. We will escort you. Let's go. - Get in, you'll go with us. - I'm not going without her. My soul belongs to her. I will take the bus. Get in. Sit down. A bit higher, Marysia. Yes, yes, yes. They're coming. They're coming! Play. Gentlemen, play! Put some heart in it! Excuse me. Do you also want to donate your savings to a school? - You see that? He's covering his face. - Decent guy. He doesn't want the fame. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, grandpa. You're a scoundrel and a rogue! - I was counting on you! - I told you not to start on Monday. I really couldn't get a car. They open new schools every day. Today they're opening three Millennium Memorials! We'll miss all the celebrations without a car! Beloved countryman, from the bottom of our hearts we welcome you to our new facility. It's his turn to get the suitcase. You'll get the third one. I didn't know the school would be so beautiful. It's really pretty. I am happy. So happy! Here. Here! THE MILLENNIUM MEMORIAL SCHOOL SPONSORED BY THE POLISH COMMUNITY ABROAD In Warsaw, a school named after the Polish community abroad was opened. Our countrymen abroad helped largely with the funding. It's the 1391st school built for the 1000 years of the Polish State. In the Warsaw gallery "Zachęta", the exhibition of works sent for the competition "Us 70" was opened. The 1st prize for a sculpture went to Zygmunt Bączyk from Sulęcice for his piece titled "Rose Joint Holder". Numerous works have already been bought by workplace representatives. It's the end of our bailer string problems. Today, the representatives of the Italian company "Ceni" and the Agricultural Machine and Tools Central Maszynohurt signed a long-term agreement on the mutual exchange of agricultural machinery. For our combine harvesters exported to Italy we will receive, among others, bailer string which should fully cover the rural market demand. 7:04 p.m. RENOVATION! 10:17 p.m. 11:57 p.m. 11:59 p.m. What is it? Well? Is it you, Wojtuś? The moaning of closing doors Quietly dies out in the night And here I am, all yours And soon you too will be mine In the small hours of the morning When you are lost in your dreams I uncover, o Warsaw, my darling Your face, veiled with the hazy sky
