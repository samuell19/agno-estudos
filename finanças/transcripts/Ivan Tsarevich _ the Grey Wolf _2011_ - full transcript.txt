- One-two. Hear me? - Yeah Once upon a time in a faraway kingdom... Aw, come on, what are we, like little kids. All have, of course, have long understood that we will focus on the kingdom of Far Far Away. But what else to tell about? It was... I mean, is a powerful State. Enlightened and cultural, pardon the expression. It had sights and attractions to the brim. There. Oh, that's not it, sorry. That's it. Look it at. (In a whisper) Cat! Ca-at! No, look at it. Cat! Threw the old man a turnip in the sea. Haul-pull, cannot get it out. Why are you waking me up? I am on a lunch break. I'm slipping. What is it? Can't get a chance to relax. Tell them not to stomp. (Singing) They shout hurray! We asked our girlfriends how much... There was, of course, a king, in the realm of faraway kingdom. Well, he was wise, just and all that stuff. And the king had a key. Secret key. And of course, there was something locked by that key and nobody knew what it was. And then there was the king's favorite... In short, served under the king... Yes, yes. But if you think I am a simple wolf, you are deeply mistaken. Deeply. Well, of course I am a wolf, but... First of all, I... First, I am a face the king trusts. Well, not a face, just a muzzle. Yes, the muzzle of the King, trusted. Secondly... And secondly, I am, what's it called? Gray Cardinal, there. And thirdly... And most importantly, I'm... - Hey, Gray! Come on, run into the kitchen and urged them with lunch. And this is our first minister, in the sense not ours, but the king's, of course. Well, no, will you lock it during the day? I will not either. Oh, dark character. Glad to see you, your Darkness. - The full moon soon. - I know. - Not... - Key. I need a key from you. - Will do. But we... - How will you get it - I... - You have to marry Vasilisa. - Marry? - Yes. The king wanted to marry her? - It seems so. But just so, not much. - Then you nudge him. Get married: you get the kingdom, I get the key. Got it? Hello, my daughter. Hello, Dad. Many different books you have, um-m. - Yes, Dad. - Red and blue, even green books. - Yes, Dad. - Oh, you are so smart. - Even graduated from what'cha call it? - Oxford. - And this, well... - Sorbonne. Yeah, yeah, and still studying. You'll soon be smarter than everyone else. And no groom will tolerate that. And I'm not going to marry. I'll make a career. Get a third Graduate degree. And open my own business. - Business! Your business - give birth to children! There is... Lunch will be served soon. "Oh, my beautiful Isolde" - said the Tristan. - "I offer you my hand and heart." Take it, you fool! Father King, please allow to talk to you confidentially. Speak. You know how much I respect you. As a statesman, and as a politic of a worldwide stance. As a human, after all. You are getting older, my reliable sire. What if there is a sudden external threat? Who will continue your work? Who will continue your beginnings and... finish your continues? What do you want? Borrow the money? This would of course... Well, no. I say, we need a person to take that power from you. To whom you can transfer the key. In short, okay. A successor, you think, I need? Well, you Father King, you say it. Your words take an inch and give a mile. So it is a successor. Where is one going to come from? - God didn't bless with a son. - But you have a daughter If somehow dispose of her properly... What are you babbling about? What to dispose of? For example, to get her, but to get where? What if... to get married? Married! Your head really works! - And to whom? - I do not know. To someone. Wow! To someone. I wouldn't even think of that. - You're thinking big. - It is, of course, yes. - Only that to someone - someone who? - I think that person should be tried. Not too young and not too old. Not very thin, and not fat either. And it would be good if he were on a government post. In a leadership position. So that, if something happens, he could lead Without delay. Well, where do we find one? What if you look around? Maybe, someone will be right nearby. - There is nobody nearby besides you. - Well, maybe it is... and so to say... You see, you do not know and I do not know! And anyway, what threat? There is no threat. And I'm still quite capable. So no worries. That's all. Go, go. - Well, what? - Talked to him about successor. Hinted nudged, pressured... - Any results? No. The old fool did not get it. Said there is no threat. Therefore, says, he'll be in charge. He himself, says, in charge. So we need to organize a threat. Yes we need. But how? We scare him. That's good. Who will scare? Guess with three tried. In general, wasn't very quiet in our kingdom, just to tell you. But in far-FAR-faraway, near here, across the road - peace and quiet And lived there Ivan, though, why lived? Still lives. Here he is, look. Who is there? More than anything, Ivan wanted to be a fireman. Well, yes. First of all, it is pretty. A copper helmet shines in the sun. (Song) We are watching for the fires And don't eat our bread for nothing. Instantly come as a wind in a field And put the fire out. There! We will stand together in a circle! We will stomp, and bamboo will bloom. We will blow - everything will go off. And people will scream: "Hurrah!" Of course, in the firemen business He liked most of all the word "Fognozzle". Yes. Because it's one thing to put out a fire from a hose, and another from a fognozzle. Also Ivan loved to assign a category of complexity to a fire. I assign third category to this fire. Nah, the fifth. There! We will stand together in a circle! We will stomp, and bamboo will bloom. We will blow - everything will go off. And people will scream... Help! There! We will stand together in a circle! We will stomp, and bamboo will bloom. We will blow - everything will go off. And people will scream: "Hurrah!" Romance. One could save a girl in a fire. Or at least some little animal. But there were no fires in this realm, because no one played with matches and did not smoke in bed. But was there a king-emperor, who loved parades. He had them three times a day. Before eating. (Warriors) Hurray! Hooray! (Horse) Hurray! (Singing) The sun is shining, the chickens peck. Grain by grain, grain by grain, ?but the military is going strong. Grain by grain, ? ?grain by grain, and the military is going strong.? "Listen to my order, my friend" - The officer will tell us. We will stomp - and enemies will shudder. And people will scream: "Hurrah!" Hooray! We will asked our girlfriends sternly: "Did anyone go around?" We will stomp - and enemies will shudder. And people will scream: "Hurrah!" King-Emperor, why do you, by God, act as a child? - Go march and serve! - I'd rather go extinguish fires. - But who will serve? - But who will extinguish? - But serve? - But extinguish? - But... Serve? - Extinguish? And so it was every day. And King-Emperor got really tired of this. Hey now, get out of my kingdom! So what, I will go. Ad this is how Ivan got into our Far Away Kingdom. By pure chance, one could say Except I'm going in the morning. Why would I go at night? Well, didn't get here yet. In the morning will get here. Loud creaking noise. Floor creaks. Who's there? Minister giggles. Noise. Rumble. A loud breathing. Awful creaking. Roar. Boo! In short, it was a hard night for the king. But Ivan, as promised, with the first roosters got going Perhaps it's for the better. I have long wanted to see how people live in other countries. At least in the kingdom of Far Far Away. Wow, that's what the abroad looks like. Hey-ey-hey! Well, I'm slipping. Five times a day. Young man, left or right? - Meaning? - Well, you want a song, a story? Also can foretell the future, get your love back. Can put a spell, can host weddings, anniversaries, corporate parties. - No, thank you. - Then souvenirs. Dolls, earflaps, commando watches. You got a fognozzle? Please come back in a week. Get me the first minister! And get me the wolf! Is that you? Well, tell me. - What to tell you, Father King? - Well, how are you? How you feel? - Did the night go okay? - It went okay. Really? And in the morning you did not hear this down the hall? (Makes sounds from the night). No. A was asleep anyway. Really? How about this from the stove? And how about this from the stove? Did not hear that, Father King. And then out of the stove... (Makes sounds from the night). - Come again? - There. (Makes sounds from the night). No, if would have recognized it if I heard it. Besides, I don't have a stove. - What about you? - Me? No. I just thought, what if you heard exactly that last night. Exactly as I showed. That would've been funny. Anyway, since it was quiet, I gave your idea some thought last night, And decided. You're right. I'm getting old, need a successor. - Where shall we look for him - So that... King-Father! We're your loyal subjects. Will do as you say. For example, if you order me to marry Vasilisa. I got nowhere to go, will marry her. I am a statesman, must obey. Phew. What does this have to do with statesman, statesman, eating state flan. And you, Grey, what do you say? I would have called brave warriors, let them compete, for example who can shoot an arrow farther, who can pole jump higher, and who will solve a riddle. In short: siltius, altius, fortius. That is, a rational man. A winner will marry Vasilisa. You are a head indeed. And look at those ears. - King-Father! - What? Ah, yes. Anyway, I am going to Vasilisa. Compile me a list of the best grooms from the neighboring kingdoms. And you prepare the sports facilities by the 14th. That's all. Free to go. So you, I see, got a market like this. No, we have a very different market. You sell more, and we buy more. - What you got there, ma'am? - Pickled cabbage. Well, not bad. But we do it differently. You pickle the cabbage, and we cabbage the pickle. What is this? A bucket? No, our buckets work differently. You pour the water inside, and we pour outside. So it'd pour out faster. What if she does not want to listen to me? - That is possible. - What do you mean possible? Be careful with what you're saying. Am I king or am I not the king? - King, King. - Here. If she starts to get stubborn, I will force her to get married. - That's right. Show the royal will. - What's right? I pity the girl. And I myself not enjoying it. What if some Ivan Tsarevich comes, starts walking around in his underwear, giving orders. Ugh. - Okay, I'll go, try. - Yes, and all will be well. What will be well? What are you, a Russian radio? - Take off the crown. - What? Take off the crown, I say. So it will all be easygoing, laid back. So you, king-father, don't start with the marriage. Come from afar. Don't teach your grandmother to suck eggs. Thank God, in politics for 200 years. Open it. He is afraid of his daughter. Not afraid of anyone, but afraid of his daughter. Cat's Waltz. You... Daughter, what weather is today. - What? - Why do you immediately say: "What!" Normal weather. How beautifully your cat plays Tchaikovsky. - This is Schubert. - No one asks you! You play Schubert, as if it were Tchaikovsky. Even worse. By the way, why are you not at work? - I have a lunch break. - So go and eat. Shoo, I say! You, father, are trying in vain, I will not get married. What's with the "marriage"? And anyway... Why not? You are too lazy to get married, or what? Not that difficult. Well, I mean, you know. Here, look what grooms we picked up for you. All are handsome. Ok, this one does not count. Look. This one's too old. But this one is normal. Well, almost normal. If I ever get married, it will be only for love! - What is this! - Why are you here? But I... Here... And you? Despot! Voluntarist! You have this kind of sunflower seeds? Funny. In our far-far-far-away kingdom, they are the size of a fist. Eat one - and you're full. That's the high striker you got. No, we have it differently. You strike it with your hands, and we strike it with our feet. - Tyrant! - That's it, I have no strength left. Here's my king's word! You are going to get married to the first stranger that shows up! - Lost. All is lost. - Why lost? So run faster, and be this first stranger. Exactly. Wow, how many of the same you have, and we do not. And here's the first stranger. Minister! Lock him away, and guard him, so he does not run away. Gray, dart into the kitchen and get the holiday table ready. Lock yourself up and weep! Bees, do not buzz! Grass, get green! Nails, unpop! Birds, do that... Sing! A wedding, wedding, wedding was full of song and dance. And it was carried away on wings. The wedding was so vast it needed more space. It needed more sky and more land. The wedding was so vast it needed more space. It needed more sky and more land! How is it? Enough or need more? - A little more. - More of what? A little more or everything. Where am I? Who am I? Um, okay. "Who am I" - that's a bit too far. I is me, Ivan. But where I am? Well, that is also not so difficult. I am here. Ugh, all's fine. Stop. And where is here? A slight concussion. I assign this concussion a third degree. No, a fifth. I got a little too excited. Gave my daughter away to who knows whom. And the main thing - don't even know why. The wolf brought me his resume. Not a hero, not a prince, and he owns no property. So deny him, king-father. Here, you see... I can not, I give the king's word. - Come on, tell him that... - (Whispers) You changed your mind. (Whispering) What? What? Got it all mixed up. Got what mixed up? Got what mixed up? I thought, it got mixed up. - And in fact, I got it mixed up. - But what about me? - And you changed your mind. - Changed the mind. No, it is not so simple to take back the king's word. Needs an excuse. - Oh, how about a test! - Oh, attest! What about attest? - What does it have to attest? - Idiot. He must pass the test. Idiot. He must pass the test. Who's an idiot? - Who is an idiot? - You. - You. - What? Tell him that long ago, before marrying the royal daughter, the groom had to pass the test. To go somewhere and to bring something back. Well, go where and bring what? I do not know. Correct. He should go I know not where and fetch I know not what. - Wow. That's cleverly devised. - Who was it? - Where? That who just said this. - This? It was me. - What are you talking about? How could it be me? I have a beard and wear a crown. And I am flat. - So it's not I, who are you, but that I, who I am. I'm getting old, I which I am. But the idea is good. And we give him three days to do it all. He won't have time, won't bring anything. It's locked. Well, the door is good, solid. Oh, and here it is open. But this is not a solution, because it's only an entrance. And what to do Hears crying. Hey, why are you crying? - I'm getting marry. - Then why are you crying - I was being forced to get married. - I see. - This is bad. This is tyranny. - Voluntarism. Probably. And getting married to whom? - To the first stranger. - A nightmare. A live person to the first stranger. - Well, who is it? - I have not even seen him. Surely some uneducated fool. - And ugly. - Yeah, that's for sure. The first strangers - they are something. And whence did he come? Fell right at my papa's feet! - Great, he could not stand on his own feet? - No, he fell down from somewhere. Flew, flew and then fell. That's some fiance... flew, flew, and fell. I also today this, that... Flew, you say? And there, where this uneducated fool fell, was there an old man standing wearing a crown, and a scary doggie? - There was. - A this one that fell, was he a tall, broad-shouldered, handsome, looked like a fireman? I looked through the crack, but... What makes you think I would even want to look at him? It's clear. And why don't you want to get married, maybe he isn't that bad? Because one should get married only for love. So written in all the books. For love? - How's that? - This is the most wonderful feeling in the world. This is when the heart beats fast and strong. And you get hot, and then you get cold. And breathing is irregular... - So that's a flu or a cold. No, you also want to sing and dance all the time. That sounds like a complete nonsense. Shut up, you're a... Oops. Don't know how to tell you, but I am that first stranger. You are? I hate you! - I hate you! - Why "hate"? What do I have to do with it? I myself do not really want to marry. If you have nothing to do with this, who does? Really? You don't want to? Maybe I also want to have your, this, a flu with a cold. Honestly? You know what then? Let us vow that we will never get married to one another. - That is easy. - Really? - Of course. I swear. You got it? - I also swear. Well, that's that. Better than "hate" or "uneducated fool". - What's your name? - Vasilisa. And mine's Ivan. Good night. - Wolves! - Stay like this. What do I tell you? Got you, Ivan, happiness. 38. How do you know my name? I know everything about you, even what you do not know about yourself. 54. - What is this, for example? - Do you know, what suit you'll be wearing today? But I know. And what you are going to eat, where you going to sleep. - Should we do cuffs? - No, I do not know. Okay, we won't. Lucky you, man. Getting married to the king's daughter. Waist 58. She's not a simple girl, with a personality. But on the whole positive, of course. An attractive appearance. And most importantly, from a good family. Can I talk with the comrade face to face? Here is the thing. In all, I will not marry her. I decided that I would marry only for love. - For love. Have you ever loved? - Not yet. - But I've heard a lot. - Well, look here. I was in love once, and what was the result? Broken heart. Do you need it? - I just gave my word. - You remember this: If you agree - you become a prince. But refuse - the king will cut off your head. I won't get married anyway. Let's say you're going somewhere, and you can not see where. Well, suppose you got there. Are they glad to see you in this sort of way? And how will you understand? And most importantly, you sit at the table, and how will you eat? In what? - You need it so badly? - Well, yes. I actually wanted for love. Well, if it is necessary... - Good, good. - Let me get married to someone else. I just gave my word. - When did you have time? - Well, take it get back. - I can not. - It's the word. - Ugh. How hard it is to deal with decent people. Newlywed. Princess Vasilisa. - Well, at least you could look at her. - Not going to, I said. Newlywed. Ivan. Don't disgrace us in front of the guests, So many people came. I said I am not going to. Well, why are you so bummed out? Worst case, you'll stay together for two years and then divorce At least look at him. Doesn't look that bad from afar. I do not want to look at him, don't want to. - Ivan. - Pleased. Vasilisa. Shall we dance? King-Father! (Song) The sun is shining, the chicken pecks. Not a hedgehog or a squirrel, the king-father walks. Not a hedgehog or a squirrel, the king-father walks. Praise our wonderful king for many years! Not a democracy, but a bright dawn! Dawn! Dawn! Dear guests, we all want to drink for the health of the young, but, as the first minister just reminded me, there is a rule of old. Before marring the princess, The groom must pass the test. So to speak, to perform the heroic act in the name of love. Therefore I command Ivan to go fetch and bring back to our courtyard I know not what. I'll give a hint. For this you must go I know not where. Deadline is in 3 days. If he brings it - they get married. If not - we will chop his head off. So, John, you're off on your quest, the rest please to the table. So it doesn't go to waste. Boo! Heart rate increases. - King-father, the guy will perish. - Oh, will perish. He'll wonder around for three days, then will come back with nothing, and I will pardon him to the four corners of the earth. I don't need him anyway. You gave your word that he will marry Vasilisa. I did. But the minister has come up with how to take it back. Big head. In short, it's... Everything has changed. You didn't not want to marry. So go home, and do not stick your nose here anymore. - You know, I can not. I think I fell in love. - With whom did you fall in love? - With Vasilisa. So, wait, how did you ever figure that out? How? Heart is pounding heavily, and I feel cold, and then I feel hot. - And the breathing is irregular, and... - And what does that have to do with love? - That's probably a flu or a cold. - Hold on. I also want to sing and dance. - This really proves nothing. - No, I can not be without Vasilisa. I'll go look for that I know not what. Well, my daughter, how your father made it all up. I understand, you fear that he might find it and come back. Do not be afraid, he will not come back. And even if you comes back and brings it, I would still cut his head off. So, do not worry. Not going to let you get married to him. - Why is she crying? - Maybe for joy? There seems to be just too much joy. Daughter, I don't understand, I did what you wanted. I love him! I want to marry him! - I'm sorry... Whom? - Ivan. - This the one who is the first stranger? - Yes. So. I'm sorry. I have a meeting. So, as I recall, I told her to choose from handsome hero princes, and she flatly refused. - Flatly. Then I flew into a rage. I said, get married to the first stranger! - She - in tears. - In tears, the king-father. Then I, as a loving father, and democratic enough king, sent him I know not where. Simply put... Well, it is clear where. - Of course. - And, hoping at least for the minimum thanks, I go to her, instead of feasting for at least 15 minutes for the whole world, and in return I get this instead of thanks. - Did I miss anything? - Nothing, the king-father. It's clear. So, there! You are now going to get married to the first strang... Oh, we went there already. To the second strang... What's the difference? I am now going to lock you up and you will sit... What's the point? She already sits. In short! Will you do what I tell you to do! What am I going to tell? I'll think of it tomorrow. Or the day after. But after this nobody should not dare do nothing! And never! Got it? That's it. All you got spoiled here! Yes. A real leader. One thing is certain. That it is nowhere here. - Why do you think so? - Because I know everything here. - And where is it then? - Somewhere not here. Well educated, you say? Where is "not here"? It's is always here. Even that over there - all the same here. When you get there. Well, actually, there is one place. But I am not telling you about it. - Why not? - Because educated people deny its existence. I'm well educated. - It is true that cats believe in it. - Then tell as a cat. Meow meow meow. - What was that? - As a cat I just meow. - And as an educated? - An educated would not believe in it. A vicious circle. So, you, educated, do not pull the cat's tail. Tell us. Well, I'm slipping. Not on the right branch. - Speak up, please. - There is one well on the outskirts. Has water, but no one uses it. Instead, everyone stays away from it. And they say that if you get closer, you'll hear: "Whoo-ooo!" And maybe it's just the wind noise. In short, if you go there know not where, it is only there. Because otherwise you can't go anywhere. Thank you, Cat. And you know what, tell Vasilisa... Nah, do not tell her anything Wait. Here, for you. You can use it to communicate with me. All's gone! All's gone! Stop your tantrum. The operation "successor" has failed? Yes. I know how it will be . He will not bring anything, but he was not get executed, because she will soften him, and he will still give her to him, because she loves him. Got it. We only have two days. Moving on to plan K. - What is the plan K? - The Key! Idiot. We should just steal it. Brilliant. But how? Who-ooo. (Terrible rolling who-ooo) Well, shall we go? Wait. What if it's just a well? We'll get wet, cold, and God forbid, we'll drown. - That's it, Gray. - Hey, wait a moment. Are you sure she loves you? Not sure. I'll bring her I know not what, and let her decide. - Yes, it is certainly not a cold. - Why not? A cold can be cured. Okay, I am going. What do you know? (Hoots and listens to a rolling echo) Weird it is here. - Do not cry, grandpa, do not cry, grandma. - (Whispers) Cat! - Cat! - Pardon. (Whispering) Hurry, I'm at work Cat, I've got somewhere, I do not know where. - Maybe you can take a look? - Come on, show it, quickly. - Cat, what's wrong? - Are you trying to scare me? That was an accident. So where am I? - I do not know. - And I do not know. So maybe this is the place I know not where? Possible. Sorry, I'm at work. So, my group, do not get lost. Now we go to the right, and sing... Wait, where should I go? Wolves. Stop! Stop! - It's me, Wolf. - I see that. - Then why are you running away? - I am running because of it! Wait, Wolf, it's you, isn't it? - Duh. - Why didn't you say so? - I was telling you just that. - Well, that was a wrong way to say it. Should've said simply, "I am a wolf." Instead of: "I'm a wolf, I'm a wolf." - Why are you here? - Well, I thought... Well, it does not matter, generally it's more fun together. So where do we go? Wolf! Koschei the Immortal, Zmey Gorynych, Baba Yaga. Yes, not much choice. How about "The beach is 100 meters away?" Or maybe: "The cafe to the right." Look, squirrel. Squirrel, hey squirrel, say, that we are now in I know not where? Well, sort of. - Where is it? - Is it here. Tell me, where do you have I know not what? No, that is not how it works. You first have to do something good for me, say, save me from a villain. - Maybe first you help us? - And then we help you. - Yeah, right. Maybe we'll get her with a snowball? - It'll be faster. - Hang on. - And from whom do we save you? - You come up with something. - Squirrel, turn around! - Yeah, like I am just gonna turn around. (Squirrel laughs) Oh wait, it turns out that you have saved me, right? Well, sort of. Then ask me what you want me to do... I'll do anything. What do you want to know? Ask me, I'll answer, I promise. Is there here an enchanted lake, which removes curses? - Grey, what are you doing, why do we need the lake? - Later. - There is. It comes to those who are on their way back. - Where do you have I know not what? - That I do not know. And anyway, you saved me once, and I answered twice. Good bye. - Are you kidding? - No, really, I do not know. There is an idea. You have to go to Baba Yaga. Right. So that she gobbles us up? That could be, yes, but she has magic ball of yarn, which can show you the way. If you can procure it, you know. He knows everything. Wow. - Yeah. - Well, what to do? Come on, we'll tell Yaga everything and ask for the ball. Numskull, didn't you read fairy tales? I read fire extinguisher instructions, why you ask? It is impossible to be honest with her. So... What do I see? What an incredibly beautiful fairy tale inhabitant! Wait, wait, do not say anything. We will guess, what is your name. You... Alenushka. - No. - Sleeping Beauty? No, that's stupid, then you'd be asleep. Barbara the Beauty with Long Braid? But where's the braid? Here's a scythe. No, it's not what I... Mary the Weaver? - Well, Mary all over. - Y-yes. No, I am Baba Yaga. - Well, go on. - Baba Yaga? No, I do not believe you. You are a Lady Yaga, well, at least, a Woman Yaga but a baba - it's not about you. How old are you? 350. Stop teasing us. Maximum of 170. - Well, 210. - Oh, well, if you say... Unfortunately this will not last forever. Well, another 100-200 years, and that's it. You will not be in such a terrific shape. What to do? - You ask me. - Come on, ask me. - What to do? Here's what. Cosmetics "Forest beauty" - and your second youth will be the first. Natural product with no additives or preservatives. - Want to buy? - Oh, yes. I want, I want. But I get my pension only in the morning. Then I'll buy it all. In the morning, eh? Meanwhile, you can stay here overnight. No, we cannot wait until the morning. - Yes? - No, we can not. Well, what then? What should we do? Okay. So be it. We could trade with you. Let's. And for what? Only, mind you, don't offer anything improper. Madam, how could you think that? We will trade this wonderful cosmetics set and a ticket to a party for those who are over 300, for... - For... - For... - For... A magic ball of yarn. - Fu... - It's a deal! It's a deal, my dear! Learn from the best, groom. (Cabin laughs) Shush! How do you say it? Ball, ball, pave the way to that, which is I know not what. - What is he doing? - It is not working. That I know not what is there, I know not where. Sorry, guys. That's unexpected. And what do we do? Let's go to Koschei then. - Can you get us to Koschei? - To Koschei I can. He's the smartest here, maybe he can suggest something. (Whispering) But he is... Can talk you to death. How is that? With words? - Yes, with words. - Words? With words - this is nothing, we ourselves can talk him to death. Go to Koschei. - Wow. - Yes. Service, indeed. Gray! (Song) Winds blow the sleigh forward, get us to Koschei in a moment. Unless on the way we get stuck in traffic. Let's exceed the speed limit slightly, and it will shorten our path Boldly jolt across, and we know the address. Here, or not? Come through, come. You can see this. I love guests. What do you mean, it's a design. Some say - it's gloomy, but I like it. Deadly so, in the sense of perky. (Koschei laughs) I love history. And I like to tell stories. What do you want to hear? We are, actually... Here I have collected the most, the most... Now, listen. It was a horrible time. Lawlessness, anarchy and chaos. The giant captured the Tom Thumb and his brothers. I remember Tom Thumb, a charming boy. Kind face, Gagarin smile And the giant - insanely bloody tyrant! But was there in this terrible tyranny a sinister beauty, a harmony of contradictions! Fire & Ice! Even and odd! - Hmm. Pardon us. - But we... - What? You are not interested? No, we are very interested. But do you have a simpler story? Simpler? Well, listen up. Here, perhaps. About a girl, whose name was Little Red Riding Hood. Little Red Riding Hood took a long road, and the wolf took a short. Right, I know that place. There is also a third road, it slightly longer than the short, but shorter than the long. - Yes, yes. And if you take it there, then at the end you turn right and if from there, then to the left. The point is to not mix it up where you there, and where from there. Hold on! And the wolf quickly ran to the grandmother, so... Stop. Which grandmother is this? Is it the one twice removed? Because if she is twice removed, it's another story altogether. - Why are you confusing me? - She had only one grandmother! - No, it does not work like that. Each person has at least two grandmothers, and in fairy tales sometimes seven, as with gnomes. - Or up to 12 as with months. But up to 12 they must be back from the ball, or the coach will turn into a pumpkin. - That's with one ball, but what about 7 or 8? Behind eighth ball that's a bad place in a pool game. Stop! Enough is enough! I tell stories here! So. - Wolf... - I'm sorry. This theme is very close to my heart. Gray or white? - Who? - Wolf. You remember? One was gray, one was white, two merry wolves. Well, lived with Grandma. Ah! That was geese. Pardon us for God's sake. - What geese? - Who saved a Star. A if you read back to front, then the rats. Do you know how Koschei the Immortal reads backwards? - Latrommi Eht lehcsok. - Don't call me names! Do you know how Baba Yaga would be back to front? - I do not know. - Agay Abab. - Where is that I know not what? - Zmey Gorynych got it. - Stop it! - And Zmey Gorynych backwards? - Stop it! - Hcynyrog Yemz, but that's ok. But what about Ali Baba and the 40 thieves backwards? - If you list them all? - Help! - Not help, but pleh. - Guards! Sdraug! That's it! Get out! Do not come here anymore. Alive... Well, now to Gorynych? Come, take us to Zmey. - What is it? - Let me go. I'll show you where to go, just may I not go with you? I am scared. And then, I got a family nearby in a spinning mill. Kids, woolen mittens. I haven't seen them you know for how long? Always show the road. Okay, go. Thank you. Stop! How to get to Gorynych? (Terrible growl.) Why did he go to that terrible realm? - Alone. That's it, he was killed. Killed. - Well, wait a minute. Why necessarily killed? Besides, he's not alone. You be quiet, you traitor! - Murderer! Why did you send him there? - Well I did not know it's that serious. If something happens to him, I won't be able to live with myself. Do not worry. In the sense of worry. I mean, everything will be fine, Do not worry. - Where he is now? What happened to him? Here. We'll see now. Exactly in three seconds you will see your lover. - In three... Wait a second! I'm not wearing makeup! And anyway, I need hairdresser. Connect us in 3 hours! Hey! Stop! Scout. What are you saying, Gorynych. We, that is I, heard that you know where to get it, I know not what. - Are you crazy? - You ask me, the embodiment of the World Evil, for something And you think I'll give it to you? - And why not? - I am gonna... You... You see... Someone has a fate. All love him. They sing songs about him. Give him gifts. At least on the level of flowers and postcards. But there has to be someone who is not loved. Otherwise the balance between good and evil will be disrupted. - Yes? - Yes. I am that someone - Yaga, Koschei and me. - The axis of evil. And you have come to ask for it. What have you come to ask for? (Muffled sounds) That I know not what. Oh, you do not know what. Therefore now you will accept a terrible death. - Fierce death. - Stop! Stop, I tell you! We will submit a complaint against you. In Strasbourg Court. For mistreatment of prisoners. - Funny doggie. - Why are you pretending? - What am I pretending? - You pretend to be evil. - And you are kind. - You need to think what you're saying. - I told you - the axis of evil. - You have kind eyes. I do? Only you keep doing evil, but you need to try to do good. - You know how enjoyable that is? - What good can I do? - Let us go. - But will leave. - Of course. - Well, what is there for me to enjoy? We'll thank you. And you'll see, how enjoyable it is. Yeah? Nobody thanked me before. Let's try it. All the same, if anything, I'll catch you and... Well, go. - So what now? - Here's what. Thank you, Gorynych. You really helped us. You are so kind and positive. - What did you say? - Thank you, I said. - Thank you for your kindness. - Wow, nice. - Can we do it one more time? - Do what? Do a good deed, let you go. - But you already let us go. - Well, I can change my mind. Come here. You got it? - Yeah. - That's right. - Now, look here. I let you go. - Well, thank me. Thank you, Gorynych, we will remember you with a good word for a long time. - Oh, good, but you practice a bit more. - Got you. - And now I let you go. - Thank you, Gorynych. I will not forget your kindness. And then, that's all? Once you go away, and I decide I want someone else to thank me, what do I do? Do some other good deed. - I do not know any other deeds. - Say, gift something to someone to remember you. Something good, valuable, what do you need yourself, but don't mind giving to a good person. Wait a minute. And if we give him the poker? Very useful thing. Well, yes, of course, but what are we to pick the teeth with? Yes, I was not thinking. How about this: the life we he could have taken away, but didn't, then is a gift in itself. - Well, no, it's demagoguery. - Maybe that thing, which is... - Which one? - Nothing. - Oh, this. This is doable. - If you mean that one. - That one. If you mean that what I mean. We give to you this thing. What is it - no one knows for sure. But the thing is certainly useful, otherwise why would my father give it to me, and his father give it to him. - And his to him. - And his to him. - A before it his to him. This is what I know not what. Well thank you, Gorynych, for your kindness, for your generosity. - Well, that's good. Cat calling Ivan. What have you got there? The magic mirror. - To talk home. - Ivan! Ivan! Who are you? Mommy. Funny goof. How about you also give me this little thing as a gift. I'll scare the goof. Before I would have taken it from you, but now I am kind. So I am asking. But I warn you, if you do not give it, I will take it away from you by force. - Tear you into small pieces. Grind you into powder. Scorch you on the spot. There. So you are going to give it? - (Whispers) What was the last one? - (Whispers) Scorch you on the spot. He will give it. Well, come on, come on. Why are you dawdling? Open it. In a moment. Instructions. That I know not what. - Here. - It can be whatever you want. Any object, phenomenon, and term, at your wish. Or it can do what is needed, but only once. Made by I know not whom. Not recommended to take into there I know not where. Do not give it to I know not whom, under 7 years old. Great. Well, let's go ahead. I mean back. In the sense of go home. What are you doing here? - I am your dream, the king-father. - Don't. I get tired of you even during the day. Go, let the treasurer dream of you. Will do. Pop quiz question: Boo! Some dreams are weird. Idiot, you have the key. (Alarm.) So, that's what you're like! - And that's it? - Get it on quickly. On me, you idiot. Moon. We need moon. Hop-pa. How do you dare? Oh, you traitor! (Ghost laughs.) Did she lied? That squirrel! Ah, so you were asking about this lake? Yes, it's beautiful. Oh, Ivan. - What is wrong? - Listen. We have a family legend. In short, that we are not wolves. That some evil sorcerer cursed and bewitched our family. And we were someone else. People, of course. Certainly not simple people. I think that we were princes. Or perhaps even kings. Because otherwise why would I have this outlook? Mindfulness, on a large scale of the individual. And now, finally, I will dive in this magic lake. And the spells will fall from me and my descendants. Do not swim beyond the buoys. Ivan, Vanya. The last time you see me like this. Now I will take on my real appearance. Well, hello, Ivan. Oh, what's wrong with my voice? Did I catch a cold while swimming? Why are you staring like this? Some gophers. Where did the gophers come from? Bring it back! Oh, please! Honestly! Oh, please! Oh, why? Well, let's have a do-over. Hey! Who are you? I am gonna you! Let me go! Bring back the wolf. Did you see that? Did you? Wolfish nature will always win. I exerted myself - and done! I became a wolf again. Without any witchcraft... This is this? It this that, for which we... Did you bring me back with this? What did you do? How could I leave you behind? Besides, I'll bring this thing back, we'll get married, but she doesn't love me. Then why bother? Uh-oh-oh. There you are. I' ve been looking for you in the entire forest. We have such a mess going on! Got it? Uh-oh-eh. Knights! Get ready! (The Knights) Hurray! Hooray! Citizen of Far Away Kingdom! From now on, I alone rule your kingdom! And they say that he also wants to marry Vasilisa! - What? And Vasilisa? - Locked herself and says that she'd rather die! - And the king? Well, I'm slipping. Here he is, the king. Along with that. (The king's crying) Help us, Vanya. - Here's how it all came out. - Got it. I understood perfectly. - Forward! Attack! - What kind of attack? - And what are you gonna do? - First we need to think. Vasilisa, agree. Angrily. Throw away even a shadow of doubt. All the kingdoms of the world will be at your feet Seems, it worked. I offer you my hand and my heart. Easy, easy. We must figure out what this hat can do. Specifically, with examples would be desirable. - What fetchin' examples? What can a hat of invisibility do? Sometimes I'd put it on and listen to what people say about us. Well, about our policies. This hat - a very necessary thing in the government. Clear. So the hat of invisibility, once on the shadow, turned if from a shadows into... Well, it is clear into what. Right? - Right. - Now everything is clear. Need to get the hat off of him. But how? I know how. For three hours no one said any thanks. - What if... - Tear antlers off a dear. - Why? - He's catching branches with it, and it's heavy for the head. - No, rubbish. No way. Maybe pull out hedgehog's spines? - They probably prick him. No? - A I'm telling you, this Ivan knew a secret, but did not tell us. Should have him... The mirror is on the link. - I am thinking... - Quiet! I am listening. Understood. We're taking off. Mate, got a light? (People rejoice) And I? Well, I'm slipping. Thank you, Gorynych, you really rescued us. Help! Help me! (Song) We are watching for the fires And don't eat our bread for nothing. Instantly come, only need your address. All as one will twist like a tornado, Adrenaline will boil in our veins. Unless we burn, we could commit a heroic act. Oh, no! The other way around! All as one will twist like a tornado... Knights! Attention! Unless we burn, we could commit a heroic act. - Ivan, did you find that, know not what? - I found it. - I knew that, I believed in you. - But I did not bring it. - Why? - Well, you know, there was the wolf, and then the lake. And the owl. In general, I could not do otherwise. And besides, we've given each other an oath. So anyway... Excuse me, how much longer is this lyrical scene? - Shush. - It's very painful. So, we can never be together? It does not mean anything. I declare your oath to be void. - I can't any longer. - Hurry up with the marriage. Cause that fellow is at his limit. Kiss. All. - Vanya. - What? - You are flying. - I know. (Sounds of the Wedding March.) (Song) Reeds were rustling, lilacs were blooming, contrabass was singing. So dance and think about the order. Any artist will be happy to sing for you. You, by the way, are listening to Boyarsky now. Enough talking, Koschei, listen our chord. And enjoy, man, that cat is playing the piano! All right. I, by the way, am not entirely a wolf. Our family was bewitched by an evil sorceress, and I was a go... Governor. - Bitter! - Kiss! (All) Bitter! Kiss! For the love, Comrades. Well, I'm slipping.
