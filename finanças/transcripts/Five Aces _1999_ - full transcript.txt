[GREEK MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: When I first told the guys about Sofe and me, I may have heard their collective jaws drop all the way from San Francisco. Now, the aces were happy for me, of course, but the code of the tribe is to always look out for one of their own. I mean, after all, what kind of friends would I have if, somehow, my "I do" fell into the ranks of "I might," or "I sort of"? [GLASS CLINKING] Here we toast as a truly blessed family. A family who has always continued to live In the bounty of his lord’s gracious gifts. [ALL] Amen. Sofia, the light of our lives, a grown woman, a grown woman soon to be married to such a handsome man. -Welcome to the family, Christos. -A good man. -A non-greek, but an honorable man. -[FAMILY SCOFFS, LAUGHS] May your lives be filled with joy and happiness, the kind the Panagoulis family always had. -Yassou! -[ALL] Yassou! [GUEST SPEAKING GREEK] [GASPING, LAUGHING] -Sorry. -It’s okay. [APPLAUDING] We’d better eat before he burns the house down. Be nice! This is your granddaughter Sofia’s engagement party!

You have a glow about you. You look excited. I think you’re confusing "glow" with "terror." [LAUGHING] Look, it’s all part of the process. -Everybody goes through it. -I guess you’re right. Sure you don’t want to change your mind, stay at the house? I’d love to, but Ash put together this whole program for me. -It’s... house is rented, you know. -Yeah, I know. Look, don’t do anything crazy. No, those guys are cool. They understand. What I’m saying is, don’t let 'em talk you in or out of anything you might regret later. Okay? Pop, you know these guys.

Anybody else here? -No. Looks like you’re first to arrive, last to leave, I assume. I just need a couple minutes to get changed and everything. So, why don’t you just come in, and I’ll be out in a second? Okay. [HAIR DRYER WHIRRING] Oh, hey, I left a bunch of food in the fridge, if you guys want to help yourselves.

Treat him like a North Korean prisoner of war. Keep him underfed. Keep him...sleep deprivation. That’s always good. -And when in doubt, keep him drunk. -Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The North Koreans were very liberal with their booze for the P.O.W.S. [LAUGHING] -Where you goin’ with this? -What do you mean? What, you’re gonna, like, nit-pick the whole plan? Is that the deal?

Once again, your timing is impeccable. We agreed that we’d talk about this after Chris’s wedding. Well, I’ve had a few days to think about things while you were out playing. -The bank called again today. -I know, I know. You’ve told me a thousand fuckin’ times. -Well, what are you gonna do about it? -What am I gonna do about it? I don’t know, Karen. I don’t know what the fuck I’m gonna do about it. Let ’em take the thing. Let ’em take the whole fuckin’ thing. For 16 years, I’ve been standing behind that counter. They can take it. -I don’t know. -You don’t know? Maybe that’s your problem: you don’t know! Maybe you just stand around all day waiting for something to happen! -Do you think I just stand around? -[GASPS] That’s what I do. I stand around all day doing nothing? Isn’t that what you do? Jesus, they’re gonna foreclose, Sean! -Let ’em! -The shower section in Home Depot Redlands... Is bigger than our whole store. -Maybe we didn’t grow. Maybe you chose not to. -Oh, shit. I married you, not a hardware store! I busted my ass. I have been busting my ass for 16 years to make a life for you. -Busted my ass! -Oh, don’t you put that on me! -16 years, 24/7! -Don’t you put that on me! You loved your hardware store! You loved it so much, you spent all your time there, and you left nothing for me! You left nothing for me! There was a time when I missed you. I don’t miss you anymore. I don’t miss you anymore. [EXHALES] -God, Karen, I love you. -Oh, don’t, Sean. Just don’t. Okay. So what is it you’re trying to say to me? You’re so blind. I’m not blind enough to see that the woman I married doesn’t have the guts to tell me she doesn’t love me anymore. I don’t love you anymore. [ASH] Well, you know, I feel a little bad about Sean tonight. I mean, really bad about it. He’s having problems, and I just wanted to hang with him, you know? -Yeah. -To Sean. -[GLASSES CLINK] -To Sean. How you doin’? -[SNICKERING] -What’s so fucking funny, Fido? -She liked me. You laughed her off. -[LAUGHING] What a doofus. She did. She was all over me. Chicks dig me, fucko. Ash, my friend, you’re just... You’re just not cut out to be the nice guy, bro. [CONTINUES LAUGHING, SIGHS] Actually, I gotta tell you, I’ve been thinking. You’ve got some interesting takes on the relationships between men and women. -Can I ask you a question? -Shoot. [SIGHS] You ever stop and wonder what it would be like to be a woman? -Uh, no. -[SNICKERS] Is that where you’re going... Getting in touch with your feminine side there, pal? Well, now, now, no. I’ve thought about it now and again, you know. Actually, I think being a woman is a lot better in a lot of ways. What the hell are you... what ways? Well, okay, take the beauty of childbirth. -"The beauty of childbirth"? -Yeah. All right, that’s nine months of hormonal turmoil Culminating in that big moment of childbirth ripping your guts apart. I’ll, uh, pass on that, thanks. I don’t know. I don’t know if it's that bad. I mean, you know... Childbirth’s a beautiful thing. It’s right up there with the seven wonders of the world. -Yeah. -It doesn’t top the wonder of the early-morning woody. -You with me? -[CHUCKLING] Ash, you’re an original. Women have better intuition. See, I knew you were goin’ there. -Whoa. -See that? [BOTH CHUCKLE] I know, we can sit here and be obvious all night, but you don’t think she's, uh, cheating on Sean, do you? I left my crystal ball in Cincinnati, man. I... Mm-mm. How ’bout you? You ever cheated on Sofie? No. You ever thought about cheating on Sofie? -Should I have a lawyer present? -I’m just curious. Everybody thinks of something at some point in time. I’m just not as liberal with my, uh, raunchy department as the rest of you knuckleheads Jesus, come on. Whoa, whoa, wait a second. I was faithful in both my marriages. Yes, I was. Something else busted them up. -That being what? -Well, it was them, hundred percent. You can’t argue this one: women have better bodies than men, by far. I mean, the curves... -You know, they’re like statues. They’re goddesses. -[SIGHS] Got a word for you: gravity. [CHUCKLES] Look, women have cellulite. -Well, so do men. -Yeah, well, women get it first. You, on the other hand, obviously have found the keys to the kingdom. Oh, come on, Todd. I’m not even crossing the moat. Oh, well, you’re on a horse, and there’s nobody dumping a cauldron of hot oil on your head. Right? I mean, what-what-what is it? What do you got? Trust. I feel like I’m not walking alone, finally. You know, I got a partner. We’re a team, you know? That’s damn near poetic. -Multiple orgasms. -So? -[SNORTS] -Hey, at least men have real orgasms. -Know what I mean? -Okay. Hold on. Women can change their minds any time they want with no justification and no explanation. -Just... [SNAPS FINGERS] -Oh, you got a point there. -That’s gotta be cool, right? -That’s... it's good. Four tequilas, please. Ooh, yeah. Straight up. [GIGGLES] You know what it was? I fall for women you couldn’t possibly have a future with, -and I marry ’em. -Bad combination. Yeah. Expensive. I don’t know. It’s weird. I've never... I never felt like a dad. Never. Never felt like a husband. Yeah, I know, I know. It’s weird, but... it’s true. You gotta have courage to think like that. You have got to want it. You’ve gotta want to surrender into someone else. And I... tried, but I couldn’t sustain it. It’s all about choices, Todd. Remember when your mom died? It was just you and your dad. You had to grow up [SNAPS FINGERS] like that. Was that a choice? It was a mandatory one. I remember watching you-- When I was a kid, watching you go through those changes. You just stopped... You stopped competing with everybody and everything, and, and, and it made you different. You were different. I’ve been hearing that a lot this weekend. Different how? Good different. Good. I mean, you know, you were a kid. You were sad, but-but... you got calm about everything. Maybe a part of me died. Sofie, does she... does she fill some of that for you? -Yeah. Yeah. -Good. -Look at ’em. Pathetic. -And loving it! -Ladies, entrez-nous. -[CHATTERING] Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, sorry. This way. See, that’s where the tub is. It’s nice, though, isn't it? -Just down the stairs. You’ll find it. -Right there. Oh, sorry! -[WHOOPING] -[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] So listen, there’s all kinds of suits downstairs, and the water’s hot. -So... -All right! Gentlemen, the eagle has landed. -Houston, we have no problems. -[CHUCKLING] [WHOOPING, GIGGLING] Chris, man, you’re not on the hook for this, because we know all about your loyalty to Sofie and all that. Ooh. But, you know, if you want me to send those girls away... -Why are you breathing so hard? -The blonde. Uh-huh. Yeah, I know. No, no. Do your thing, man. -Go crazy. Have fun. I’ll just be over here... -You sure? -jacking off. -Okay. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] We’re coming! Do us a favor. Could you bring us some towels? [ASH LAUGHING, WHOOPING] Careful, now. Watch my wooden leg. -[SCREAMS] -That’s not my leg. -Hey, Ash. You gonna chew on that log all night? -Oh, look who’s here. That’s not Ash next to me anymore. It’s nice, kind of like a boy-girl-boy-girl thing. -Well, stop the world. Um, how you doin’? -Hi. -Are you going inside? Can you deliver these? -Yeah. I appreciate it. Thank you. You bet. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [ALL CHATTERING] Where’d you go, Ray? -What do you mean? -What made you just walk? I was wondering when you were gonna ask me that. What do you see? [ASH] What am I, a lip reader? They’re looking at the stars. [TODD] Well, looking at the stars. That’s... Nah, that’s horrible. You know what that means? That means, like, philosophy and God and life and all of that crap. -Ugh. -If Ray fucks this up, man, I’m gonna kill him, I swear. Isn’t that supposed to be pointed in our direction? I was working late one night at the car lot, right? And Gloria and I were supposed to go to this party. Of course, I couldn’t go ’cause I was working, you know, so she went by herself. And when she came out of the restroom... Well, there was this guy standing there, you know. She tries to make her way past him, and he stops her, and he hits her. And then he, uh, rips her shirt off, and stuffs it in her mouth so no one can hear her scream. He kind of has his... has his way with her. Well, I was already in bed by the time she got home. I was sleeping. And the next morning, I wake up, and she’s very disturbed. She’s very strange. She won’t even let me look at her. And I asked her what was wrong. She won’t tell me. All she does is cry. She just cries, you know? So, like a jerk, I immediately assume that maybe she had a few too many drinks, You know, and, uh, hooked up with some guy or whatever. I get mad, and I want to leave, you know? So I’m on my way out the door. And she stops me at the door. She pulls her shirt aside, and she shows me these marks. Then she told me what happened. I mean, I was gonna kill somebody. So, uh, she begs me... I mean, she begged me not to say anything. So eventually the conflicts within her began to outweigh the contact between she and I. Hmm. Well, then one day she walks in, and she just asks me to go. So, I did. So I ended up out there in that old trailer that used to belong to my pop, where you found me. So, you see, Chris, I, unlike those guys up there, wasn’t hurt by a woman. I was hurt by a man. A stranger just walked in and blew out my candle, you know? [SIGHS] And that’s why I come out here every day, and I stare into the sun, because that’s my candle. And I defy any man to blow that out. And, hopefully, God willing, one day that light, that sunlight, will shine in her again. I’m sorry. But I miss her. I miss her a lot. Yeah, yeah. He’s-he's had it for some-- -Some time. -Some time. Yeah. -Oh, no. Wow. -Wow. Yeah. Yeah, well, it’s terrible. And he’s our friend, so... When the diagnosis came in... -Big. Big tumor. -Big-big tumor. That he’s only got a little... -A little time to go. -Yeah. Oh, poor Chris. God! Can’t they do anything? Ah, they-they... They... -They... You know, you may be able to help. -You. You. Me? How? Yeah, well, come inside, we’ll talk about it. -That’s the saddest thing I’ve ever heard. -Yeah. You like puppies? [SOFIA] I’m looking at you as my life. Why get into something that’s forever if I wasn’t absolutely sure about it? I love you, Christos. -[KNOCKING] -Chris Martin, you in there? [CHRIS] Yeah, I’m comin'. -Morning, Ray. -How you doin’? Sean didn’t come home last night. What? Sean didn’t come home last night. Maybe he’s working things out with Karen, huh? -I haven’t seen her in years. -Right. -Hey, Ray. -Hello, Karen. Karen, how are you? Why don’t you come on in for a minute? -Hmm. -[DOOR SHUTS] [CLEARS THROAT] Is, um, everything okay here, Karen? I’m leaving Sean, Ray. You’re... What? I-I... I don’t have that feeling for him anymore. It’s been bad for a long time. I know you two are his friends, and that’s why I'm telling you. We’ve been cramped in this house for so long. God knows how much longer we would have stayed here. I feel like if I don’t do it now, I’ll never do it. I’ll die here. I never cheated on him. I never lied to him. I’m ready to live with what I’m doing. I feel like I’m saving the rest of my life. Chris, I’m sorry if this seems like bad timing. Chris? I’m sorry, I'm... Yeah? What? I said I’m sorry. I know it’s bad timing. Um, does he, uh, does he know you’re leaving? He’s known for a long time. You know where he is now? [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [TIRES SCREECH] Hey, Sean! Are you in here, man? Yo, Sean! I’m gonna help myself to a socket set if you’re not here, man. -Fan out. -Fanning. -Check. -Sean! Sean! Are you in here? Yo! Oh, shit. If he’s not here... Are you breathing? Hey! I got him. Ah, Jesus. Is he alive? Yeah, he’s just dead drunk, that’s all. -Jesus. -Let’s clean him up, guys. Stand up. Stand up, Sean. Come on. -What’d I do? -Nothin’, buddy. I got my license right here. -All right, get him back! -One, two, three. Aah! -Here you go. -[SHOUTING] [RAY] Come on, buddy, you got it. Why don’t you guys wait outside? I’ll take care of him. You sure? Yeah? You got him? -Hold him, man. He’s gonna go down. -I got him. You’re gonna be all right, buddy. [SOBBING] -All right, brother. -[MOANING] All right. All right. Go ahead and finish up in there, okay? [SOBBING] I must look like a real fool, huh? There’s no fools in this room, man. I sure feel like one. Hey, man, I’m sorry you guys had to find me like this, you know. -Where are the aces? -[ASH] Ray and Chris are outside. And Todd’s back at the house waiting. Sean, you and I have always been close, right? Pretty close. Yeah. You know we’ve all gone out and done our own thing and gone our own ways, but you and I have always, uh, always stayed in touch, you know. We bust each other’s balls, and, you know, do some, uh... We fight, but, you know... -That’s just guy stuff, man. -Yeah. But you know how you’ve always been Mr. Open Guy? Mr., uh... What do you mean, "Mr. Open Guy"? Shit, man, you... You are the most honest guy that I have ever met. Your feelings, you know-, you just let ’em out there for other people to see, and I, I’ve always admired that in you. Most guys, you know, they’re dickheads when it comes to that stuff, myself included. So... I’m gonna tell you something that I’ve never told anyone in my life. Hey. It’s in the tunnel, bro. The tunnel. Thanks, man. Uh, we’re going back awhile. This is New York. Uh, I’m in the Big Apple, N.Y.U., Freshman year. I’m alone, vulnerable. I meet this girl. A vision. I fell for her. I fell for her hard, Sean. Christy Johnson. I, for the first time, clearly understood what it felt like. Love, you know-, what that feels like. So, uh, we talked about things. This is serious. She’s the one. We’re making plans. We’re going to, uh, get married, have kids. You getting married and having kids. At that age? Who knew? Yeah, so... this is the one love of my life, the only girl I ever truly loved, and... sadly, probably the only girl I’ll ever love. So anyway, Thanksgiving break’s coming up. My dad invites my brother and I to go out fishing, And I’m thinking, "I don’t know", you know, "It’s the break, Thanksgiving. I’ll take Christy home. Do the dance for the people," and Christy said no. She said, "This will be good for both of us." Yeah. So, cool. I go, have fun, fish. Come back, call her up. Catch her mom at the house. Her mom says she’s gone out of town for a couple weeks with a friend. She’s left a letter for me, though, with her mother. She wrote me off, Sean, like I was, uh, a stranger. Just... no reasons, no explanation, no, no recourse. Just... you know, "See ya. Oh. Bye-bye." Reason she left town was ’cause she was pregnant. She was pregnant, and, uh, she was carrying a child fathered by a guy that she didn’t love. And... Killed it. Killed it like it was nothing. Just... What was she thinking, Sean? What--what are you thinking when you actually do that? I-I don’t, I don't get it. Anyway... Long story short, I’m, uh, I'm trap-doored and I’m fucking floored. I track her down. I say, "Christy, why? You owe me that. Why? "You tell me why. You tell me, goddamn it. Why? How could you do that? Tell me." Right? "Sorry." "I’m sorry." Shit. So that-that’s why I’m fucked up. Part of me’s never gonna let myself go out there again. Never gonna let myself... Broken. It’s fucking... There’s a clamp on it now. You know, so years later when I get married, I, uh, I marry a woman I can’t fully love. A woman I’m never gonna let hurt me again. See how sick that is? How fucked-up it is? Hey. You’re a good man, Ash Gray. I needed that, brother. Thank you for hearing me out. What are you doin’? -Eavesdropping. -Mm. Are they done in there? Let’s find out. He all right? Boys, I got a plan. As the old saying goes, Rome was not burnt in a night. So tonight, the world is our ashtray. So tonight we ride. We’re stepping out, brothers. I bought one for all of you mugs of the wedding party. This seems like a good time to break ’em out. Boys? -Ash... -[ALL] Rules. Let’s get amongst 'em! His name is Howie, and how we love him for singing! -So give it up for Howie! -Whoo!

Seany, I feel bad for you, man. You played it by the book. You read the manual. You’re still gonna get your ass kicked. And then there’s me! Todd Lackey! Ugh! Two divorces. The only two cases I ever lost. So what do you say, aces? Why don’t we tally it up? Come on. Let’s do the math real quick. We got three divorces. We got a separation, whatever the hell that is, Ray. And another divorce coming down the pike like a runaway truck. Got a guy finally gonna try marriage at the tender age of 35. Does it even make you guys think for one second? Does it even make you wonder? Huh? ’Cause it scares the shit out of me that none of us can maintain a relationship. I got my ass kicked tonight. [CHUCKLES] You know something? I didn’t run. I’m tired of running. Chris, if any of this means anything to you, take it to heart. When the going gets tough with Sofie, and it’s gonna get tough, you don’t run. You don’t run like the rest of us. You stick it out. Because the other thing is so much worse. Todd! Hey! Let him walk it off. Had a rough night. [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] [CHRIS] Adolfo, you ever wonder, like, uh, I don’t know, not so much about your choice, but about the right decision from now until whenever? Oh, all the time.

I don’t even know how people get together anymore. You know what I mean? It’s like... I mean, I don’t know if I'm ever gonna meet Mr. Right. -You’re fine, Chris. -You think so? You are gonna be fine. It’s gonna be the end of the story. You’re there. Trust me. -Hi, Adolfo. -Girl! You look scrumptious. -Hi, Chris. -Hi, Laura. How you doin’? Where are all the aces? Oh, they’re over there.

They need the shirt to make up for the personality they don’t have. [SIGHS] Morning, boys. Get a cup of coffee in this joint? I got a shirt like that. [CHRIS] Thanks, Ray. Listen, Todd, uh, I know that what happened last night was, was embarrassing for you. We were all embarrassed.

I’ll be back. Okay, Arnold. -[DOOR SHUTS] -Chris isn’t downstairs. Where the fuck is he? I thought he came home with us last night. Well, boys, my keys are missing. I’ll lay you ten to one Chris decided to take a little walk. I bet he’s sitting in my trailer right now. What the hell’s he doing in your trailer? Maybe he’s with Laura. [ALL] Fuck! [TODD] Positive this is a shortcut? [RAY] Trust me, Todd, trust me. [SEAN] Hey, Ray, I didn’t know you had a handicapped spot. -[ASH] Yeah, I didn’t even know you golfed. -[SEAN] Good for you. [RAY] Yo, Chris, come on, man. Chrissy! Braveheart! [ALL SHOUTING] -[POUNDING ON DOOR] -[GASPS] What’s going on, guys? Looks like you’ve seen a ghost. More like a nightmare. -It’s, uh, her... -What? -What? -Gun. -Her gun? -I don’t have a gun. But your dickhead husband does! He’s closing in. [CHRIS] Think! Come on, think! [ALL CHATTERING] [LAURA] Uh-oh. This is a very dangerous weapon. Hey, you shot at us. You’re the only one who knows how to shoot it. Shoot it, yeah. Aim it, no. A couple of warning shots, Ray. Come on! Fine, I’ll aim the gun. Are you kidding me, man? That’s a deral case. It’s a police officer! [SEAN] It’s Ayman Davis, it’s not a police officer. Come on! Right. Come on! Get out of there! Get out of there! All right! Go in the car. Go in the car. You guys back the car. Hand me a shell. [WHOOPING] [SEAN] This is not a drill, boys! All clear. Fire in the hole! [CANNON FIRES] Ah, shit!

You go after those boys, Ayman Davis, you’re gonna answer to me. -But, uh... But-- -Eh! -I’m the sheriff! -You heard me. -Yes, honey. -[ACES WHOOPING] Fuck Ayman Davis! He’s always been a fucking bully! He’s always been an asshole. And he’s got nothin' on us. Chris takes his woman and we blow up his car. Yaah! If any of you knuckleheads ever, ever, ever decide to get married again, do me a favor, don’t invite me. Yeah! We’re so white! Ayman sucks. Ayman sucks. [ALL CHANTING] Ayman sucks. Ayman sucks. Ayman sucks. Ayman sucks. Ayman sucks. Ayman sucks. Ayman sucks. Ayman sucks. Ayman sucks. Ayman sucks. [FATHER] What is it, Chris? You look a little pensive. I don’t think "pensive" covers it. I’m nervous, you know. Real nervous. [CHUCKLES] Oh, well, that’s natural. Everybody feels that way. I still miss her. Still miss mom being around. Yeah, me too. Did you go out to see her? Nah. No. Listen, Chris. I want to say something to you. Marriage is... Well, it’s sticking to something that you committed to because you want to. You know, I was never unfaithful to your mother, not once. I had my opportunities, believe me. You really loved her, didn’t you? Oh, boy. She was mine, and... and she was the bee’s knees. I’m scared, Dad. I’m really scared. Of loving somebody... that much and then... losing her like you did. You know? Wait. Here. I want you to take this. -What is this? -It’s your mother's wedding ring. I know she’d want you to have it. Hey. Don’t be scared. Thanks, Pop. [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING] Getting married. Thought I should come up and tell you that. Dad’s good. Dad’s real good. Still driving the same old truck, you know? She’s a good gal. Good girl. Uh, nice family. Loving family. I think you’d be proud. I think you’d love her. I think you will love her. Sorry you won’t be there, but I... I know you will be there. [SOBBING] Rose for a rose, huh? I love you. I wanted to surprise you. Your dad said you might be up here. I hope it’s okay. Yeah, well, as usual, he was right. I got you a wedding present from mom. I missed you. What was that about absence making the heart grow fonder? It worked. I missed you. You want to meet my friends? [SOFIA CHUCKLING] So these are the five deadly aces, huh? Look at you guys. Where are you? I’m comin' up. -See that right there? -Yeah. -That’s Ash. -Aw. -Yeah, looks like Ash, right? -Always in control, right? Oh, yeah. So we thought. -There’s Ray next to Ash. See him there? -Okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Soldier without a war. Oh, boy. Captain wilderness. -Oh, there’s, um, there's Todd. There’s Todd. -[SOFIA] Mm. [CHRIS] Ready to sue somebody, I guess. -And, um, there’s Sean. -He’s nice. What’s not to love? Oh, oh, who’s that? Who’s that? -Who’s that? -You. -Who’s that? -That’s you. Me. [CHUCKLES] These are my... Oh, I love you too. These are my friends. [RAY] Hey, thanks for getting me out of that trailer, you guys. I appreciate it. [ASH] Yeah, see now, see that look right there? That’s why chicks dig me. [TODD] You know something, guys? We threw the kitchen sink at him this week. He didn’t bat an eye. I think he’s gonna be all right.
