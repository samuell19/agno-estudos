What's the big deal, Uncle Henry? I mean, I really don't get why I couldn't go with them. Ah, come on! We've been over this, Dana! It's your folks' anniversary. They just wanna share an adventure. I can be adventurous. Oh! Can you? Yeah, sure! Why not? Hmm... Well, to be able to see beyond the obvious requires imagination. What shape is your imagination in? What do you mean, shape? - Well, I mean, how well-tuned is it? I'm not exactly sure. Hmm. Should we test it? Yeah. OK. Look, what do you know about pirates? I know they were mean. Oh yes, they were. Indeed, they were. And the meanest of them all was Captain William Kidd, who, if the legends are correct, visited this very mountain. Now, imagine him standing over there. Can you see him? Not exactly. He's got on a black tricorn and a scraggly beard and yellowing teeth and a crimson waistcoat. Go! Go! Look hard. You'll never be able to see what was or is or might be unless you're really willing to look. Yeah... There he is! I see him! Good! Now, do you see his henchmen? - Henchmen? - Oh yeah! A filthy bunch of ruffians, you know? Both odoriferous and dangerous. And they were standing over there, right opposite their Captain. See 'em? What are they doing here? Well, you gotta tell me. Do they have swords? Do they have shovels? Both, Uncle Henry! Swords and shovels! Oh, then sure as we're standing here, they have come to bury... Treasure... Looking at the pencil in a glass of water, our eyes tell us it's broken into 2 pieces. Yet when you remove the pencil from the glass... It's not really broken. Just as with the pencil, what seems to be true at first glance, the circumstantial evidence against my client, Antonio Huertas, must be examined more carefully. As jurors, it's your responsibility... To use your imagination, to look harder, to look beyond the obvious... To discover... The truth. Thank you, Counsellor. We'll recess for 10 minutes, and then the jury will begin deliberations. Let's go, Mr. Huertas. Odds? - Fifty-fifty, which isn't bad considering his chances before you took his case. Oh no! What? My ex is getting married today, and I was supposed to pick up my kids an hour ago so he could go on his honeymoon! All right, call me when the jury's in. Will do. You know, don't even try and defend her, OK? I won't. 'Cause this is exactly what I expected, and you said she wasn't gonna do this! I am so sorry, Brandy! Court went over. OK, you know what? Save the excuses, Dana. We both know why you were late! All right, look, I know that she thinks I intentionally ruined her big day. But I promise you... No, don't worry. We'll catch the next flight. Look, I really am sorry, Colin. There was nothing I could do. Yes, there was. You could have been here on time, like you promised. Colin! Oh... So! Other than the grand finale... How was the wedding? Can we just go? I totally missed a scrimmage because of you. The wedding was perfectly fine, except for the bride, of course, who wasn't you. So what's for dinner? Pizza time! OK, so what do you want me to do? Chef duty. Oven's hot. Great. - Where's your sister? - Don't know. Plugged into that emo-screamo junk she listens to. She probably can't even hear-- - Hear what? Are you dissing me again? Will you get over it? - Excuse me! - Over what? - Nothing. - Nothing. Well, whatever "nothing" is, it's put you two at odds for the past few months. I'm getting tired of it! You and Dad can fight, but we can't? You know, if you are referring to what happened today at the church... Perfect! Sorry, I have to take this. Of course you do. Hey, Joel. When? All right, I'll be down in a minute. Yup. Bye. OK, the jury's in on the case that I'm working. We are gonna continue this conversation tomorrow. Can't. Totally slammed ma√±ana. Me too. Way busy. What about you? You booked, too? Afraid you're gonna have to take a number, Mom. I'm gonna be home in a couple of hours. OK? Could you two please try not to kill each other? OK? - 18-year-old robbery suspect Antonio Huertas is free today thanks to the efforts of public defender Dana James. Huertas, who was charged with felony armed robbery, faced 20 years in state prison. Here's to Mom! Always there for the poor and downtrodden! If Antonio's sister is as snotty as you, he might wanna ask the jury for a recount! If she's a smart alec like you, he might wanna tickle her until she wets her pants! Not in the house! And eat something. OK? A glass of juice isn't breakfast. I'm going to the gym after school, then to a party at Caroline's. What party at Caroline's? - Just a party. - You didn't tell me. When would I? I've barely seen you all week. Are her parents going to be there? I don't know. What's with the cross-examination? Are they? Jake! As far as I know, they'll be there, OK? No, it's not OK! You find out and have them call me. And I suppose you're going to Caroline's, as well. As if! I wouldn't be caught dead at her house! Trust me, she wouldn't be caught dead inviting you! All right, enough! If Caroline's mother calls me, you can go to the party. But I want you to come home before you do. Keep rolling your eyes, and you're not going! Whatever. And you... Your mood has gone from white to grey to black! It's starting to scare me! I mean, I expect you to walk in that door with some fohawk and "Love-Hate" tattooed on your knuckles! Jade, I can't help you solve this problem with Jake unless you share it with me. There is no problem, other than Jake being a complete jerk. So can I go now? Fine. Go. It's hormonal. They'll grow out of it. Ha! Just in time for you to grow into it! What's this? - Found it on the porch. - Tesla Falls... That's where Uncle Henry lived, no? - Uh-huh. What's it say? It's from a lawyer. Somebody wants to buy the property Henry left me for... a lot of moola! I know you've told me, like, a zillion stories about your Uncle Henry. You never said what did him in. - A cliff. - A cliff did him in? Well, technically, no. Flying off it actually did the trick. What happened? Um... I was in college. Well, his name is Colin, and he wants to be an orthodontist. And Uncle Henry and I were in his old jeep. And, you know, I remember telling him about your dad. He is so smart! And he's so cute! Uncle Henry, are you listening to me? What... What? Who is that? - Nigel. - What do you mean? It's Nigel Fowler! He works for you! He's your friend! Not since he found out what's really inside the mountain! Ah! Get out of the car. - What? - Get out of the car now! I don't understand! You don't have to understand! Hide behind the bushes! Stay down! Ah! Sounds like something from a movie. Yeah... A movie without a happy ending. Oh! There's your bus! Let's go. Oh, what about the Fowler guy? Well, I called the police, but no one witnessed the actual crash, so no charges were filed. And Nigel... He just disappeared. Spooky! Yeah... spooky. Well, what about the offer? - I don't know, because it's a 24-hour deadline. And if we do go, we're gonna have to go tomorrow to sign the papers. Let's do it! Let's go! Please! Pretty please with sugar on top! I'll tell you what: I'll think about it. But you need to catch a bus. Have a great day. Go! Go! Go! Oh, and while you're thinking, "Harvard tuition, very expensive!" OK! Bye! Bye. * Look at me * * You may think you see who I really am * * But you you'll never know me * * Every day * * It's as if I play a part * * Now I see * * If I wear a mask * * I can fool the world * * But I cannot fool my heart * * Who is that girl I see... * This puzzle has boggled some of the greatest minds in the Western world. * When will my reflection show * What an exceptional child. * Who I am inside? * You... Mom, I'm home! I'm in here, honey. Hey, Maddie, did I... Did I ever show you this puzzle? I don't think so. Hmm... let's see. I... What an exceptional child! Hey, how was school? Same old. So... - So what? - Don't tease! We going or not? Going where? The mall? Because I'm desperate for a ride! Not the mall. Uncle Henry's. The guy you used to visit when you were a kid? What about Uncle Henry? You know, since fate has gotten us all together in one place, I would like to convene a meeting. Yeah, I don't have time for a... No, you need to make time. Um... Years ago, I... I inherited some property from my Uncle. Who died in a spectacular car crash! - You didn't tell us that part. - Really? That's beside the point. The point is, someone wants to buy it. We need to go up there to sign some papers. - Maddie... - Sorry. This money will go a long way into paying for your college. And, um, you know what? I think a weekend in the country might be good for us. So we're going? All right! - Together. - What? - As a family. - When? - Tomorrow morning. - But... - It's Saturday! - That's final! - Ah! - Yes! All right, you can go get ice cream. I'm not gonna be long, all right? Sure. - I'll be getting some cookies-and-cream ice cream. That's a really good idea. I want cookies-and-cream ice cream, too. OK, cool. Watch for cars! - Oh! - Whoa! Run! Sorry, I didn't... Sorry, I didn't hear you come in. No, no, that's OK. I was enjoying the drum solo. You think Charlie Watts should be worried? Probably not. But it's still nice to meet a lawyer who has rhythm. It's nice to meet a client with a sense of humour. I'm Tom Kent. I assume you're Dana James. I so appreciate you coming in on a weekend. Oh no, it's my pleasure. Yeah. No, please, have a seat. Papers are all ready to sign, unless you decided to change your mind since we spoke last night. No, my mind's made up. So what's your dog's name? Oh, uh... That there is... Well, that's Holmes. - As in Sherlock? - As in Oliver Wendell. So who's the buyer? Uh, a holding company offshore. Oxford Worldwide Financing. - Who's the principal? - No idea. My only contact with them has been by phone. They retained me to find you, make an offer, cut a deal. - A bit mysterious, no? - Maybe. But they're willing to pay twice what the property's worth as long as you waive the seller's-remorse period. So once you sign, there's no backing out. It'll take 5 days for the cheque to clear. But after that, the mountain is theirs. Just the mountain, not the lodge? Apparently, they're only interested in the land. Yeah. Crazy, huh? There you go. There's a pen. Thank you. You know, it's a nice old house. Make a good getaway for you and Mr. James. Uh, Mr. James is on his honeymoon with a new Mrs. James. That's good. I mean, not good that he's on his honeymoon, but good that maybe you'll decide to keep the place for yourself. Yeah... I mean, and if you do, I think you'll find that we have a lot to offer... In Tesla Falls, that is. I'm sure you do. Yeah. Well... Well... It's been very nice to meet you, Mr. Kent. Tom, please. OK! Uh... See you! I hope so. Wow! Kind of beat-up! It's been a while since it's seen any love. Got a "whatever you do, don't go into the basement" sort of vibe. I think it's awesome! Let's go inside! I'll wait out here until you break through the cobwebs! Me too! Yell out if you see somebody in a hockey mask. This place is so cool! I'm gonna go and check out the upstairs. - OK. Don't destroy anything! - OK! Uncle Henry? I'm surprised to see you here. You're surprised? I'm surprised... You're dead! How could you... I loved you! I wanted to be you! Hey, Mom, guess what! I found this really cool... Oh... Ah... Oh my... You look just like your mother 30 years ago! You must be Madelyn! Yes, I am. And you're... I'm Henry. Uncle Henry? Yes, that's me. You don't look like you went off a cliff. Oh! Because I didn't. My jeep did. So you never really croaked? No. No, I was thrown from the car, broke a couple of ribs. But I just... I got up. I walked away. Walked away where? Europe, Asia, South America. Started consulting, under an assumed name, of course. - Of course... - Hello? Any "body" in here? Uh, guys, this is Uncle Henry. Yeah, right. Nice try, squirt. So you must be Jake, I take it? And you're Jade? Hmm? Did you ever Google yourself? Oh, it's quite interesting! No, Maddie is telling you the truth. Years ago, I let your mother think that I was dead. And I'm still waiting for you to tell me why. Well, it's rather a long story. It'd be better if you all stayed over and I can tell it properly. Wait, wait. So we're actually going to, like, sleep here? Just... Go to the van and bring in your stuff. Yes! Yes! It's a little chilly in here. I think I'll start a fire. Awesome! Are you insane? Sorry, I didn't know it was loaded! So let's hear it. What's this all about? About a book. A personal journal. Actually, it's written in code. What do you remember about Nigel Fowler? I remember he didn't like me very much, although he always pretended that he did. And I tried to mentor him, but ultimately, I found out he had ulterior motives. What do you mean? He'd blow up the Sphinx if it made money for him and his people. And you had no idea? No. No, I really didn't... Not until the day he tried to force me off the road. Here, sit down. Look, since then, I have found out an awful lot more about this guy. Like what? Like when he was studying with me, he'd been hired by these very dangerous guys who had some wealthy clients who were willing to pay small fortunes for rare antiquities. OK, so what does this mysterious journal have to do with Nigel and you pretending to be dead? I had formulated this theory about what was really inside of the mountain, and I stupidly shared it with Nigel. And on the last day that I saw you, Nigel overheard a conversation that I had with a rare bookseller in London. This guy had found this journal in a library in a Scottish castle. And I think that Nigel felt that if he could get to it first-- - And eliminate you. - And you too. Don't forget what a threat you were to him. Then he'd get what's in the mountain with nobody in his way. That's right. Hey, what about food? Running on empty here. Yeah, good. Well, we've got a full pantry, and I could whip something up. What do you think? - All right. - OK. Not in the house! Ah, why not? Why not? It's as good a place as any. But you know what? Actually... I have an old hoop hanging on the side of the shed. - No way! - Way! Yes way! Yes way, right? - Yes. - Yes way! - All right. - OK. Hey! Oh, he's a good kid, you know? Come on, let's go! Wow! That's enough food to last... Till I find my way into the mountain. At least, that's the plan. Well... What? I... Sold the mountain. What? You died, remember? You left it to me in your will! I mean, I sat on it for 18 years, Henry! I mean, I couldn't even bring myself to come up here because of the memories, until out of the blue, I got a letter. Somebody wanted to buy it. And so I sold it this morning! But you can get out of this, right? It's not possible. Trust me. Why not? - I'm a lawyer, and it's an iron-clad contract. Oh... Now, if the cheque clears in the next 5 days, it's gone. Who bought it? - What's the difference? - Who? Oxford Worldwide Financing. Oxford? That's where I met Nigel. Don't tell me I sold the mountain to Nigel Fowler. How could I be so stupid? It's not you. It's me. I'm sorry, Henry. You know, I've always said, when a family's in trouble, they run together, not apart. And I just didn't follow my own advice. But maybe it's not too late. I mean, we still have 5 days, right? * If I could find the truth * * Buried inside of me * * If I could see it through * * I would be * * Who I want to be * * And I can't keep on hiding * * Who I am * * Or maybe who I wanna be * That was beautiful. It's so nice to hear you sing again. It's been a while. Yeah, well, inspiration's been a little hard to come by lately. - You know, Jade, if you wanna talk about-- - I don't. Someday... She'll discover, angst is optional. Thank you, Dr. Freud! - You're welcome. - Come on. Come here, you. Ha! Hey! This reminds me of Dana when she was your age. You talking about Dana as in my mom, Dana? - Uh-huh! I put that thing up for her to practice. She became quite an ace. She never told you? That'd require us to have an actual conversation. What do you mean? Nothing. Well, you know how it is. Between Mom's job and school and sports and Dad's shared custody, there's just not a lot of free time. I see. Hmm. But it's cool, though, you know? Right. Cool. Wow! So you hungry? I got it. Huh? Yeah. Oh, nice try! I need to practice. Maybe you can show me some tips, huh? - OK. - All right. Ah... This is amazing, Uncle Henry! Yeah, well, it's just a little recipe I picked up in Egypt while I was surveying the Temple of Karnak. Do you want some? I could actually use a little more, please. So what's inside the mountain, Uncle Henry? And what's it have to do with pirates? Ah, well... You remember Captain Kidd, don't you, Dana? Of course. What did we decide he was doing that afternoon you saw him on the mountain? - You saw him? - Yup. In here. He was burying treasure. Oh no, it turns out he wasn't. He was digging for treasure. - How'd you figure that out? - Inadvertently. I was studying a totally different subject, and I came upon this shipping manifest. And it told of 2 vessels that were bought by the Earl of Lansdowne, a Scottish archaeologist. So why'd Earl buy these boats? Earl was his title, doofus. Whatever! OK, let's let Uncle Henry finish his story. Well, he needed the boats for an expedition in 1689 to this mountain. Why this mountain? He thought he knew what was inside and wanted to see whether he was right. - So did he find out? - Yeah, was he right? Well, yes, he found out and yes, he was right. Well, so what happened to him? Well, on his way back to Scotland to organize a proper scientific excavation, he was captured and tortured by your friend Captain William Kidd. Did he tell them about the mountain? Yes, he did, and then they foolishly killed him. Why foolishly? Because he told them where the mountain was, but he didn't tell them how to get inside. So the secret was lost forever? Not quite. I mentioned that the Earl commissioned two ships, didn't I? Right. Well, what happened to the second one? Well, he escaped Kidd, And it returned back to Scotland carrying with it this journal. You beat Nigel to it! Yes, I did. Unfortunately, it was written in a complex code. Did you break it? No, I tried for 18 years. Believe me. But it took a supercomputer in Zurich to finally crack it. - What did the code say? - What's in the journal? Tell us! Please! Well, the journal describes... What the Earl saw... As he descended into the heart of the mountain. Which was? Which was what I'm gonna tell you... First thing in the morning. Nope! That's it! Come on! - Come on! - What kind of story is that? That's not fair! That's it. That's all you're getting. Hmm... You know, the kids seem to like their rooms, especially Maddie. Meeting your family... Makes me regret even more not having you in my life all these years. Oh, believe me, I regret it more than you. You were my rudder. And when I lost you... I'm sorry, Dana. You've been through a lot lately, right? Do you feel like telling me about you and... Colin? Colin. Not much to tell, except that this whole mess has taken such a toll on my kids... Jade and Jake, especially. Yeah, I guess I can see that. You know, I dragged them up here this weekend. I figured, you know, new environment, quality time... None of which changed a thing... Until you showed up. I haven't seen my kids so... I don't know... Innocent... In a long time. Well, it doesn't have anything to do with me. This mountain, it just brings out the best and the worst in people. It has for centuries. I missed you, Henry. I missed you, too. I hope it hasn't all been for nothing. Me too. Good night. Well, good night. Oh... Good night. Sweet dreams. You're gonna work off some of that food, I think! Oh yeah? Straight through the woods, then we're gonna go up the hill... Are we gonna take that trail that you told us about? Awesome! Let's go straight through... So what's the big secret, Uncle Henry? Yeah, spill! You can trust us. We're family. Yes, you are. Well, to start out with, I want you to tell me everything you know about the Aztecs. They were from Mexico. Well, that's where they ended up. But even their own legends say that they originally came from the place of the herons. Herons, as in birds? That's right. According to their mythology, if one were to follow the migration of the herons, they'd end up in the place where the Aztec civilization was born. Anybody ever try to find it? Yes, they did in 1519. Moctezuma, who was the Aztec leader, sent 1,000 warriors and a golden mask, which was a symbol of their revered Sun God, back to the place from which they all were born. Ah! Which was where, exactly? I believe... That you're standing on it. Cool! So these Aztecs buried a gold mask right here under our feet? Well, way, way under! This mountain is nothing but a honeycomb of caverns and tunnels. Now, you see, I think that the Aztecs found a way in, and then they built a temple to house their god. And then they disappeared forever. So how do we get inside the mountain? Well... we've got 4 days to figure that one out. Assuming your mother will let you stay, of course. I really like the botanical samples in the little bottles... - Oh! You scared me! - Hello! - She was your age. - Just around here? Hello! Hey, there I hope you don't mind my dropping by. Not at all. I had copies made of the agreement, and I thought it'd be better if I give them to you in person rather than, you know, by mail. That was very nice you. Mr. Kent, this is my whole family. This is Jade, Jake, Maddie... Hi! - ...and Uncle Henry. - Hi. Does your father practice law in Tesla Falls? Uh, I... I inherited his clients when he passed away, about 2 years ago now. I'm sorry to hear that. I knew him well, your father. He was a good man. Yes, he was. Thank you. We're going on a treasure hunt. You wanna come? - Maddie! - Oh, that sounds... All right then! Um... Let's all break up into groups. - Me and Uncle Henry! - OK. What's your first name? - Tom. - Why don't you go with Dana? Works for me. Wait, which leaves me stuck with Jade? Uh, who's stuck with who? So what exactly are we looking for? Carvings in stone of a hummingbird. - Hummingbird? - Yeah. The Aztecs believed that dead warriors came back as hummingbirds. Blue hummingbirds, to be exact. Aztecs, huh? Well, sounds cool! Yeah! The journal says that where you'll find one carving, you'll find 2 more. Got it? Which will lead us to the Sun God's temple! Exactly! Wow! Hummingbird carving, Sun God temple. I got it. You're on! OK, let's get some sandwiches and refill up our canteens and head on out. Welcome, Tom! You up for this? Does Moctezuma want revenge? Don't answer that. So how long you been a public defender? Pretty much since I passed the bar. It must be exciting work. Well, it better be, considering the lousy pay. Where'd you live before Tesla Falls? Oh, New York. I was corporate counsel for a big insurance company. So... is the grass really greener? - Uh-huh. Getting more so every day. Come on, Uncle Henry! Keep up! Ah... Don't worry about me. Hey, this is where we were this morning! That's right! According to the journal, the Earl thought that this was the entrance to one of 2 shafts that supplied fresh air to the warriors who were constructing the temple. - Cool. - Yeah, cool. That's what it did. It kept 'em cool. You know... If you use your imagination, you'll probably see them digging. Yeah, I see them! Lots of them! Where? Right there! See? And they're digging, just like you said! How come the hole's filled up? I don't know. It probably collapsed... Way before the Earl ever found it. Which only leaves one shaft. That's right! And the elusive entrance. "One way in, one way out." That's what the Earl wrote. Hey... What? Oh, I thought I saw someone. Where? Over there. Are you sure? Maybe. I could be wrong. You really think there's something inside this thing? Why shouldn't there be? The whole Aztec thing sounds a little wacked to me. Then sit it out. You're good at that. Hey, we're supposed to be a team. Remember? We stopped being a team a while ago, remember? That's it, I'm taking a break. What, again? We just took a break! That was lunch. What? It wouldn't kill you to try and fit in. - With your puffed- and-buffed crowd? Yeah, no thanks! Right, better to avoid the competition, not worry about how you look. I'm not in competition with you, them or anyone. All I'm saying is, if you'd stop trying to be a freak, maybe somebody would ask you out, for real instead of... If I wanted a date, I could get one. And I could promise you, it wouldn't be with your brain-dead... Wait... What are you doing? Move. - What are you doing? - Move! Yes! We found it! We found the carving! What? We found the carving! - You what? - Hey, hey, hey! What's all the yelling about? - We did it! - We found the hummingbird! No? Fantastic! Where? On a rock wall under some moss. You found something? Yeah, about 45 minutes from here. Come on! - Let's go! - Stop! Hold on! Calm down. It's getting dark. No, no, your mother's right. We really can't go until the morning. - Come on! - No! The Sun God has waited 500 years. One more night's not gonna make a difference. Come on. Let's go now! Let's go play Monopoly or something. Get it out of your minds. Come on. I thought you guys were... Crackpots? No, I was gonna say, just playing a game. It's not a game. My... My Uncle has spent most of his life trying to uncover the secrets of this mountain. And if we do find a way inside, we could discover one of the most important archeological sites in North America. Then I better take things more seriously tomorrow. That is, if you don't mind my coming back out. Tom, I don't want you to think that... All I think is, I haven't had this much fun in... In ages. - OK. - OK? - Mm-hmm. So I'll see you tomorrow? Yeah. Good night. Good night. Jake? Hello, Dana. Long time. Not long enough. I've been watching you... And your whelps, crawling all over my mountain. Yeah, well, it's not yours, not yet. If you care about your children, Dana, you won't wait. You'll pack them into your soccer van and drive them back to suburbia while you still can. Henry! You're looking well... for a corpse. Take your hands off her, Nigel, or we'll see what you look like in that condition. Nigel! Why did you buy the mountain now? A phone call from a colleague in Zurich made it seem like a wise investment. I deal with lowlife all the time at work, Henry. They don't intimidate me. But when it comes to my children, that's a different story. I can't stay here, not now, not with my kids. We're leaving in the morning. Ah! You are so sick! - What are you doing? - Nothing. Right. You're trying to figure out how to use the carving so you can be the big hero! I was not! - Were so! - I was not! - Were so! Give me the book! - No! Ah! No way! What just happened? - We trashed a 300-year-old book is what just happened! Oh! We are so DOA! This is AYF! Stop spelling stuff! We're talking, not texting! Wait... What... ...is that? I bet even Uncle Henry didn't know it was in there! We should go wake him up. No! We should check it first. It's probably nothing. OK. Be careful. Be careful! It's old! I am! I am! Whoa, whoa! It's a map! Of the inside of the mountain! What now? What'd it say about the carving? - How should I know? - Jade! OK, all right. Um... It said that the second carving would be 20 paces due East of the first, and the third carving would be 30 paces South of the second. Is that it? No, it... It also says that... Look! Look here! "Standing in the centre of the triangle thus formed, "bear witness the morn's first rays kiss the mountain's door." "Morn's first rays..." That's gotta be sunrise, which is in, what, an hour and a half? - I'll go wake them! - Forget it! By the time they get up, we'll miss dawn. Which means we'll waste another whole day. So let's leave a note, go find the entrance, then come back and get everybody else. OK, uh, we're gonna need flashlights, batteries, matches, a compass and anything else you can think of. Meet me outside in 5 minutes? Let's do it! Which way do we go? - Shh! They're asleep! Come on! - I know! - Let's go! - I'm coming! - Mom! - Maddie? What--what's the matter? Jake and Jade just left. What do you mean, they left? I mean they went up on the mountain. OK, assuming we find all 3 of the hummingbird carvings, how do we find the middle of the triangle they form? According to the description, the triangle has 2 legs that are the same length: 20 paces. And they form a 90-degree angle, which makes it a right triangle. So if one leg is A, one leg is B, then the 3rd leg, C, is the sum of A squared plus B squared. Once we find that, we can halve the angles and mark the spot where they intersect. And that'll be the circumcentre. Huh? Uh, don't worry. I brought string. What do you think you're doing? Going with you, of course. Uh, no, you're not. You'd still be asleep if it weren't for me! - I don't care. - Then get some rope. Rope? To tie me to a chair. Otherwise, I'm going to follow you. Ah! Ugh! All right, OK. I don't have time to argue. Let's go. But you stay close to me, OK? Yes! Here it is! Now all we have to do is just find one more! OK, which is 20 paces South. So... 1, 2... 4... ...6, 7... ...19, 20! Wait... There's no rock here! Well, how can there be a carving if there's no rock to carve it on? You must have counted wrong. No, I'm sure I counted right. I just... Wait a minute. Well, dig faster! It's starting to get light! You could help! Oh! Yeah, right. There's something here! It must have been on the surface once. But buried over the years! Now we have to find the centre. Before the sun comes up over that ridge! Oh no... Jake told me the clearing where they found the carvings was fairly near the top of the mountain, which means we should take the trail that leads upwards from here. Now aren't you glad I came along? How did you know how to do this, anyway? Unlike you, I actually paid attention in Geometry. Unlike me, you paid Maddie to tutor you! Oh, whatever! Just finish tying the string! All right. Done. OK. Where the strings cross is the centre of the incircle. OK. So... What do you want me to do? Um... OK. Come stand back-to-back with me and keep your eyes open. Oh, here it comes. - Awesome! - Wicked! OK, we have to get up there before the sun rises and the beam fades. Go! Go! Go! Go! Slow down, will you? My sticks aren't as long as yours! They said it was 45 minutes from the house. We should be there any minute. Jake! Jake! Jake! In here! In where? Here. I can't believe it! We should go get the others! - Or we could peek inside! - Just give me a second. Ah! There we go. Just in case anything happens... Ah! It won't take 300 years for someone to find us. Amazing! Amazing squared! Jade actually remembered what I taught her about finding the incircle of a triangle! Shouldn't you have, like, a giant forehead or something? This is reality, Mom, not the Syfy Channel! Why don't we take that incredible noodle of yours and figure out where your brother and sister went, OK? Already did! They went up there. This is it? This is what all the fuss was about? This is lame! I got up in the middle of the night for nothing! What do you two think you're doing? Yeah! Coming here without me? I told you to wait outside! As it turns out, this whole "inside the mountain" thing is highly overrated! Yeah, all that hoopla for a goofy little tunnel and another one of these stupid hummingbird thingies? That doesn't sound good. Maddie! Is everybody all right? - Yeah... - Fine, Mom. Jade? Jake? We're all cool! We're all cool! Better than cool! That was sweet! Hey, Maddie, how did... Hmm... Dana? That's warmer than the pool at the Y! Any hotter, and we would have been toast! Come on. It is hot down here! My clothes will be dry before I know it! Not much of a silver lining. Can't get out the way we got in. Which leaves us stuck down here. Not to worry. We have a map! Hmm... Hmm... Keep it hot! Keep it cold! Or... Keep it dry! Where'd this come from? Uh... From a little accident we had with Uncle Henry's journal. Nigel! Well, Uncle Henry said where Captain Kidd was digging was actually a collapsed air vent. Which is probably this one. The only other vent, right here, is how the Earl got out. Yeah, 300 years ago! I mean, what are even the odds it's still there? They're the only ones we have! OK, Uncle Henry said that they dug this shaft to get air to the warriors building this temple. So find the temple. And we find our way home. - Ahh-ooh! Uh... Morning! Right. Yeah, come on in. Close the door. OK, so tell me again what the note on the map says. "Let odious rot's insult to nose offend thee not, "as 'tis thy compass rose." - Is that English? - Duh! A compass rose is the circle on the map that tells the directions. And odious rot is when you smell... Oh, what I'm smelling now that's disgusting! Oh, Jake! No, it's not your brother. It's sulfuric acid. I don't care what the clue says. My nose is totally offended. We must be on the right track. Just shows you, if we work together... Whoa! Jake? Where is everybody? I have no idea. What are you doing? - We had a prowler. - A what? A man named Nigel Fowler was threatening Dana last night, and I think that he came back... - What? What is it? - Well, apparently, our prowler was actually Jake and Jade, and it... It seems like they found a map. Let's go! What? Go? Go where? To the clearing where Jake and Jade found the hummingbird. I'll be right down. You stay there. Oh! What are those for? No idea. Can you see if anything's inside? Yeah. Be careful. - Ahh! - Jake? You OK? Way better than these guys. Sorry for the hysterics. Your big brother screamed louder than you did! - Did not! - OK, you two! Stop bickering, please. Hey, look! Those could be useful, right? Good job, sweetie! Excellent! Here, look at this. That's really something, huh? What is it, anyway? They found all 3 carvings. Yeah, well, what's with the string? They used it to find the incentre of the triangle, which allowed them to find the entrance to the mountain. Huh! OK, which is... Which is where? Well, we're not gonna know till tomorrow morning at dawn. Come on! Oh! Good kids! Good kids! Well, it looks like we have to go through the tomb to get to what the Earl calls "the canyon." Wait, hang on. Rewind. You mean we actually have to walk through, like, all these dead guys? Oh, don't be such a wuss! Come on! Easy for you to say. You're used to hanging out with boneheads! - Shut up! - No, you shut up! You're such a jerk! Shut up! Be careful with your torch! Whatever! Mom? Yes? What happened to all these guys? What do you imagine happened? I think... They stayed on purpose... To protect the Sun God... For all eternity. Maddie... I think you're right. I think these guys chose to stick around. I, on the other hand, would like to get out of here as soon as we can. So what do you say we catch up with the twins before they get us in any more trouble, huh? Yeah. What are we looking for now? Huh? Oh, the second air shaft. Well, why don't you use a GPS? - Well, you got one? - Ah, no. No. Well, neither do I. A more primitive version of this device was used by the Earl of Lansdowne. And if my calculations are correct... Our second shaft should be just beyond there. Come on! Let's go! It's a tunnel! With or without? No bones about it... Oh, thank goodness! Jake? We're in here! Does the map say where we're headed? "Good care be praised. "Death's hand is near "a spot well blazed "by an Aztec tear." OK, well, that made less sense than the last clue. OK, well, let's break it down. "Good care be praised." - Uh... be careful! - Good. "Death's hand is near" is... Well, that's obvious. And a little scary. So what is the spot blazed by an Aztec tear? Sounds like my... Jake, look out! Good call, squirt. Man, that is one long fall! Maddie, stay away from the edge. Don't worry. Jake's watching out for me. Ha! Whatever! You know what? I've had about all I can take of your... You've had? This is not the time or the place! Our lives are in danger! Do you understand that? Maddie, take hold of your brother's pack and follow him up the trail, OK? - OK. - Hold on. You, stay here. All right... I wanna know what happened between the two of you. Look, Jade... I know the divorce was hard. It's not about that. Then what? You're gonna think it's stupid. Try me. You know Jake's friend Mark? Of course. A few months ago, I got a text from him after sixth-period gym class asking me to go to junior prom. Take some shots, bro. Man, that was a fun party last night. Did you guys have fun? Did you? Yeah? Yo, Jake! He wants to shoot? Take some shots, bro! * Maybe I was na√Øve * * Got lost in your eyes * * And never really had a chance * * My mistake * * I didn't know how to be in love * * You had to fight to have the upper hand * * I had many dreams * * About you and me * * Happy endings * * Now I know * So, um... What time? What time? What time are you coming to pick me up? For the prom? The prom? You and me? But your text... No offense, dude, but even if I wanted to take a freak to the dance, which I don't, you'd be the last act in the carnival I'd ask. * I'm not a princess * * This ain't a fairy tale * * I'm not the one you sweep off her feet * * Lead her up the stairwell * * This ain't Hollywood * * This is a small town * * I was a dreamer before you... * See? Pretty stupid, huh? No. Why didn't you come to me? Since the split with Dad, I don't know... You just... You always seem to have your plate full. It's 'cause I kept it that way to help me be able to get past... My problems with your father, which, of course, had nothing to do with you guys. I've been so unfair to you, Jade. I'm sorry. I just want you to promise me one thing, OK? Sure. Don't you ever... Doubt what an amazing kid you are! OK? OK! Come on. Let's go. Ah! It's useless! We've spent hours looking and... And we just have to look harder. What is it that we're missing? You know what? I don't... ...move. Whatever you do, do not move! - What? - Don't move! - What are you doing? What? - Behind you. - Oh, that doesn't look good. - No, it's not. Oh... Oh. Easy, easy, easy. Easy! Whoa! It's just a harmless corn snake. Yes, baby! There we go. You want him? Uh, no, that's OK. Very pretty. - Uh, yeah. - Well... Where'd he come from? Out of that hole. Hey, do you feel that warm breeze? Yeah. I think we found our air shaft. Oh! There is no way I am setting foot on that thing! Really something, isn't it? Uh, yeah, something totally terrifying! Jade's right. This thing's hundreds of years old. We're not going to risk walking on it. Yeah, well, no choice. According to our map, it's the only way across. That's the bad news. Good news is, if we survive... Wait! No, no! No good news starts with "If we survive..." Well, when we survive, we'll be really close to the temple. And hopefully, the air shaft that's gonna get us out of here. So I figured I would carry Maddie across first... What? No, no. If we go, we go together as a family or not at all! Hey! Hey! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! - Jake! - Jake! - Jake, be careful! - Jake! Whoa! Jake! - No! - Jake! Jake, are you all right? - Come on! Hurry! - Let's go! Get across before it falls! Give me your hand, Maddie. Careful! Watch your step, Maddie. Grab your sister! Jade, come on! Maddie, be careful! Give me your hand! Hurry! - Jake? - Jake? Jade? Jade! Come on! You can do it, sweetheart. Jade, hang on! Jade, take my hand! I can't! I'll fall! Take my hand! Grab your brother's hand! Jade! Trust me! Come on, baby, you can do it! Come on! - Jade, come on! - Come on! You're nearly there. Go ahead. I've got your back. About time! You guys can do it! Come on, sweetheart! Give me your hand! - Jake! - Jake! Jake! - I'm OK! - Give me your hand! Jade! - Come on, sweetheart! - Come on! - Come on, Jake! - Come on, Jake! - Are you OK? - Yeah. - Are you OK? - Yeah, I'm fine. Uh, guys, that Fowler guy stole our map. Shouldn't we try to catch him while we can still see his light? She's right. Let's go. - Come on. Wait! Maddie! Maddie! - Jade! Look... I should have stood up for you... With Mark, I mean. I'm sorry. Well, you pretty much saved me from falling into a bottomless pit, so... I suppose that we're even. So... Are we good? Yeah, we're good. Come on. Ah... Henry! Huh? Hey! Oh... Hey, look, I found this helmet in the shed with this rope. Yeah, good. Let me have it. And here, tie the rope off over there. You're not going in there. - Of course I am. - How old are you? - Forty-eight. Come on, Henry! What difference does it make? Come on! What difference does it make? You wanna save your family's life? - Yeah. - Well... The difference is, I'll have a better chance of doing that. We found it! It actually exists! And we found it! I'm proud of you guys. But wait! That's totally weird. They're bats. Lots and lots of... Bats! Ahh! Ah! Ahh! Ahh! Whoa! Whoa... Ahh! Oh... OK... OK... You guys have any idea how important this site is? How much archaeologists can learn just by studying the art and the architecture? Too bad Uncle Henry isn't here to see this! Nobody's gonna see this unless we get out of here to tell them about it. Well, we can't get out until we find the air shaft. And we can't find the shaft without finding the map. Well, let's go get the map. Come on. Nigel! Ah! It's so beautiful! And so mine. - You're not taking that mask! - No? Who's going to stop me? Hmm? You? Not her! Those! Ahh... Well, if that didn't stop me, you certainly won't! Get out of my way! You have to get by us! Oh no! Now what? Take Maddie! Get out! Go! Go! Go! Go! I'll be right behind you! Go! Come on! Nigel, leave the mask! Just leave the mask! If you don't leave it, you're gonna die with it! Oh! Come on! Wait! Where's Mom? - I'll go back. You guys go! - We don't have the map! - He does! - Where's my mom? - Stay back! - Mom! - Back! - Wait! Maddie! Don't go back! - Stay back! - Maddie! Back! Back! Stay back! Mom! Ah! God! I can't believe you just did that! - That-a-girl, squirt! - Dana! No, no! Wait, wait, wait! - Tom? - What are you doing here? We found a second air shaft. I came here to help you. Mom's still stuck. She might be hurt! Take 'em back up to the trail. In about a hundred yards, you're gonna find-- - An Aztec tear. - Exactly-- OK, exactly! Go! Go! We'll be right behind you. Be careful. This way. This way! Go! Go! Come on! Be careful. Uh... Dana? Dana! Dana! Hey! Hey, Dana! Dana! Up here! Up here! Give me your hand! That's it! Come on! That's it! Good! What! Fowler! Fowler, wait! Where's my family? Not my problem! None of you are! Not anymore! I've wanted to do that for years! Dana! Come on! There you go. Hey... Oh! - Tom? - Yeah. Here. Come on. - Whoa... - Take it easy. Dana! Dana! - Where are my kids? - They're out. We're next. - Let's go. - Come on. Oh no! Ah... Yeah... Yeah. If the shaft caved in all the way, we're finished. - All we can do is hope. - And keep digging! I think I see an opening. Guys, listen! Come on, this way! I hear something. Mom! Maddie! Oh! Oh! Oh! Don't tell it's blocked. I wish I could. Wait a minute! Do you hear that? Someone's trying to dig us out! Uncle Henry? - Dana! - We're here! Dana! Kids! - Henry! - We're here! - Uncle Henry! - Uncle Henry! That's it. Easy. - Henry! - Ah! Ha! Uncle Henry! Jake! OK, guys, walk back. I'm gonna push these rocks your way! Great! Stand back! You got it! There you go! Send Maddie through! Don't be afraid. Give me your hand. That's it! Come right through! There we go! Take your time! - OK, come on. Ready? - Yeah. Just dive. Go forward! There we go. Careful! Now run! Run out! Come on! There we go! Out! Watch out! There we go! There we go! Go! Come on! Come on! Who's there? There we go! Watch your step! They're coming down! Tom! Be careful! This whole shaft's coming down! Let's get out of here before it's too late! Come on! - Henry's right behind me. - Hey, baby... Hurry up! Come on! - Yeah! Hurry up. Come on. - Come on! Hurry! All right? You OK? Baby... Wait a minute. Where's Nigel? He came out before all of you, but he had a little accident involving my fist and his chin. He's right over here... No, he... Where'd he go? Well, I don't think it makes aifference now. - No, I don't think it does. - Oh, Henry! Oh! Let's go home, everybody! Come on! - Let's go! - Let's go! Come on. - You OK? - Yeah. Clean up a little bit! There we go! - All right! - Hey! - I'm starving! - Hold on tight! What are we gonna do for fun tomorrow? Oh! How'd it go? Well, Maddie was first aboard. Naturally brilliant child. And what about Jade? She's on. I think... I don't know, but I think she's relieved at the prospect of a fresh start. And young Jake? Well, he met with the local basketball coach, and it seems that they're in desperate need of a starting forward. Excellent! Excellent! All right then. What about you? Hmm... The dreams I had as a little girl... Of digs and discoveries and temples and tombs... They all died with you, Henry. Oh, I see. You know, when I arrived here, I... I was feeling derailed. And then amazingly, you came back to life. And I began to wonder if it was too late for my childhood dreams to do the same. So you voted, uh... Yes! Ah! Ah! I voted yes! I am so glad! Oh, so, so glad! Oh! Oh! That must be Tom. He said he was gonna come up for the day. Yes! I beat you to the treasure for, like, the 10th time! Second time! You only won 'cause you skipped the secret passage, which is cheating! The more things change, the more they stay the same! Will you please stop arguing and say good morning? - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Would you like some coffee? - No thanks. I just came by to deliver some good news and some bad news. What's the bad? Well, it turns out, you were right. Oxford Worldwide Financing stopped payment on that cheque before it cleared. Well, we were counting on that. And the rest of the news? You still own the mountain. - Yes! - All right! All right! So what are you gonna do with it? Well, you know what? It felt so good to reconnect as a family... We had a meeting... And voted unanimously to make it permanent. - By moving here! - Oh, that's... To mark the occasion, I have a little gift for you, Maddie. - For me? Really? - Uh-huh! That's for not only using your head, but also your hat! Thank you so much! - Oh, that's cool! - Thank you. So who wants to go for a hike? On our mountain! - All right! - There you go! - It is, indeed! - OK! You're going to lead the way?
