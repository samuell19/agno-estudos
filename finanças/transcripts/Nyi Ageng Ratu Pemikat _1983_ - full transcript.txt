Dad, dad...this is Ageng daddy... Open the door, dad. This is Ageng, open the door please daddy. Son of a bitch! Open the door please dad. Open!... Dad... You little bastard, what do you want?! - Wandering around this late! What is it you really want? - Mother's sickness is getting worse, dad. - Ageng hopes you would come home. - No way! Your mother is too old, weak, wrinkled! She's now only waiting for her death, why do you still want to take care of her? Maybe this is the last time, she wants to meet you. Please come home even for a while dad. - No need. If she has to die right now, let her die. - No dad, only for this time, I beg you, for pity's sake! - Ageng, please go home now, let me persuade your dad. - Sumi... Close the door now. Ouch.... Be patient, madam. Asking for God's help too. Pray to God, mom, pray. In the name of God, and His mercy. and His prophet, Mohammed. Where is Ageng...? Big sister Ageng is asking daddy to come here, mom. It's no need to ask your daddy coming here. I already surrender myself to fate. I'm old now, he doesn't even want to touch me anymore. There, sister Ageng is coming home, mom. Ageng, my daughter. Sis, where's daddy, sis? It's okay, my child. I just want you and your little sister Ranti accompany me here now. You don't have to bother about your dad anymore. Dad is cruel, he doesn't love and care about you now. Come here near me, Ranti. Give your baby birth even without a husband. Ageng, you're my only hope. Goodbye, children. Mother...motherrr......... Miss Ageng - The Queen of Seductive Mother is the only person Ageng love. Your heart is very noble. Resolute in facing the misfortune of living even the most bitter. She's the victim of a man's lust. I hope God will forgive every sin she made. Beautiful girl, sweet girl, where are you going? How beautiful you are. What is your name and where do your parents live? It's pity a girl this beautiful is mute. Answer us. We want to hear your voice. Hey guys, precisely a beautiful mute girl like her should be gangbanged. Let's rape her. Hey, don't go anywhere, darling. Don't run sweetheart. Wait! Your handsome guy is here, sweet pea. Cute girl, wait... What do you want?! Hey, woodsman, go away. Mind your own business. I think you'd better cancel your bad intention to her. Do you think you can mess with us! You bastard! Let's go! Wait for our revenge!!! - Thanks for your help. - Your welcome. - My name is Broto, and what's yours? - Ageng Ayu. Ageng Ayu? What a beautiful name. - For your safety, could I walk you home? - Sre, thank you. How is it? Is my proposal not good enough, Mr. Permana? Ah, not at all. Even I admire your bravery and wealth, Bagus Sanjaya... ...to propose for my daughter. Sanjaya, is my daughter going to have the same rights as your other wives? Of course, I have to be fair. And why did you ask, sir? That's very natural. You are a very wealthy guy, and famous for your kindness and tender loving care to your wives. There she is, my daughter. Ageng, let me introduce you to Anak Raden Bagus Sanjaya. Come here...come. do you know who he is? He's your future husband. I already arranged everything. Hey Ageng, I will make you as my third wife. Your dad agreed. Ageng! I don't want you to have a bad fortune like your sister Ranti. - Knocked up by a guy who claimed himself as a bachelor. - Yes, but that was not all her faults, dad. That guy is a coward... for leaving his wife behind. You still want to defend your sister whom already doomed our family's prestige and status. Ageng, next week you should be married. No bargain! It's my decision! Sorry for the inconvenience, Bagus. I'll take care the inside affair. You don't need to worry about that. Thank you. Ranti! What's bothering you, my little sister? Big sister Ageng, I just want to follow our mother to die. No, you should not think that shallow Ranti, okay? Dad is now hating me. Also people around us mocks me all the time. I just want to die, sis! Don't lose your hope just like that. The baby inside your belly has the right to live also. What's the point sis, if in the future my child would only get humiliation by people as a bastard. Let me die just like mom. Congratulations. (conversation in Dutch) Congratulations. - Aunty's leaving you now, get rest, and I will come again later. - Okay. - Mrs. Ali. - Congratulations Mr. Permana. - Mr. Ali how are you? - I'm fine, thanks. - Your daughter's marriage party is so grand. - Enjoy the party. My wife, are you happy tonight? i'm sorry, dear. I hope you don't demand anything from me first. Why is that, dear? You are now legally my wife. Tonight, you must do your "duty" to serve me. Mister, Mister...Mr. Permana! - Someone's fainting. - What's wrong? - Someone's fainting, sir. - Who's fainting? - Ranti. - Blood. - Blood? - Yes, there at her room. Miss, Miss Ageng, open the door please. What about Miss Ranti?! Miss Ageng, open the door! Miss Ageng, open the door. Sir, Miss Ranti, Miss Ageng's sister is fainting, sir. Huh?faint? Where is she now, aunt? - At her room, miss. - Okay enough, aunty. Please take care of her. Aunty, wait! Ageng. Darling, I have to see her Ranti's condition first. No, Ageng. - I have to see Ranti first! - No. Fulfill my desire first. Ageng, this wedding night shouldn't be interfered with anything. You really don't have a feeling. Is this how you treat all your wives? Come on, Get undress! No. Ageng, you made me lose my patience. Stop here! We're taking a shortcut.. Let's go! Ageng! That's her. Look! - Please stop! - Don't go backward! Dear my husband Raden Sanjaya, please leave me alone. No, you are now my wife, let's go home. No, every guy is cruel, deceiver, and ruining every girl's life. Ageng, don't follow your anger. Calm down, please go back to me. I prefer to die alone to living with such horrible man. Watch out sir! No way Ageng. You can't put hatred to every guy. You are a woman, you need a man. So does the other way around. Ageng, experience is the best teacher... The death of your sister and mother, also your disappointment to men are fate. Your father didn't give much of his concerns to your education, especially about the religion. It's your father's fault. He is a rich guy, though it's not only wealth which later he should bequeath to his children. - but also education. - True, mam. - And then what should I do now? - Your soul must be strengthen. And so does your body. I will insert your face with these diamond and gold needles. So your face will be more glowing. After this, attire your body with beautiful clothes, so every guy will be enchanted and titillated. Indulge yourself with traditional ingredients made by your own ancestors. And the most important thing...burn this sign to both of your inside thighs, so your virginity will be eternal... until you meet your future husband someday...Open!... Hold that little stove there until it's getting colder. Enough! Open. I already blessed your body. Do your intention! Although my feeling told me, Miss Agnes is still alive. - How could that be...It would be... - Sastro! Don't be afraid, sooner or later that beautiful girl and her plantation will be yours. Miss Rangga, if what u told me just now is going to happen, I will share you the wealth. To accompany your journey, bring my 8 girls. Starting now, I hold the authority of this house and plantation which used to belong to the late Raden Permana. All of his wealth is now under my responsibility. All of you now are my maids and here to help me. You should obey everything I ask you to do! Because I have a sneaky intention to own all of this wealth. Sorry, Raden Sastro, Miss Ageng Ayu, the daughter of the late Raden Permana is now back. - Is it really her? - It's true, sir. Welcome home, miss. Welcome home, miss. We found miss Ageng in the rubber plantation and brought her back here right away. - Are you the real Miss Ageng Ayu? - True, Sastro. I was saved from a disaster. I'm back now. - We gladly welcome you miss. - Thank you. - About your dad, miss... - No need Sastro... You don't need to tell me the story, I already knew everything! Sorry, miss. I mean your father left a hefty inheritance ...and to take care of this house I specifically hire the some village girls. - I really hope you will take them as maids. - Great. Seems like I still need you as my right hand, Sastro. Ready to go, miss. - Unbelievable! - What is unbelievable, brother? That girl, I think she's still a virgin, she makes me horny. You don't know what you're talking about. Virgin or widow, it's still the same, she's our boss. - Your own boss. - Shush, if she's our boss, watch your mouth. - But have you noticed that bearded Sastro, her personal assistant... - What about him? Such an ass-kisser, he must pursue something else. Dear my beloved daughters, as women, you have to well-behave to the men... honesty and fidelity are your most precious things... even though we have to suffer. - Honey, are you ready yet? - Wait a moment. Hurry, the sun is already that high. - Be patience, Broto. - Huh, i'm worried the market will close early. - Careful, Sastro! - Move away! Damn! Do you want to die?! Hey, you! Don't you have eyes? - Wallking like this road belongs to you! - Broto, don't! What do you want? You want to defy me?! You don't know who I am? I didn't defy you, but don't insult us. - Enough Broto, enough! - Ouw, so this is Broto. Okay, miss. Miss Ageng Ayu, how are you? - I'm fine. - You're getting more beautiful now. Ahh, thank you. - Who is this lady? - This is my mother. Mum, this is Ageng Ayu, the daughter of this plantation's owner. - Sorry for our rudeness. Where are you going, mam? - To the market, selling our own garden's yield. What if you and Broto work and live at my place? Thanks for the offer, miss. - What do you think, mam? - Please give us some time to think about. - Ouw, sure. Please receive this to substitute your damage. Receive it, mum. Take it as a good fortune. Yes, here, mam. Thank you. Mam, excuse us. Okay, excuse me, see you later. See you. Huh, Sastro! What are you doing? How could you do such impudent action to me, Sastro? Sorry, miss. Please forgive me, miss. I've known since a long time ago, that you want something from me. You love me secretly! No, The answer is no way! Because you are a greedy guy. Rub all over my body with that smoke of Sandalwood and fragrant root. Get off of me! Ban, Iban! You filthy monkey! What are you doing there? - Share okay? - Shush, keep your voice down! - Share the girl with me, okay? Miss Ageng Ayu should be subjected! I don't deserve to get this insult. Make her drink the water from this bottle! She must fall in love with you. Use this tool. And you can decorate this cave with corpse of your enemies. Take it! - Morning, miss. - Morning, where are your other friends? - They are touching up at room. Your drink, miss. Hey, wait. Please bring this letter to Karto, the foreman. Do you know his barrack? What kind of drink you just gave to me? Say it! - Which guy who wants me to fall into his laps? - I'm just...I'm just..... - Good afternoon, Meneer Smith. - Good afternoon. Is the lady inside? Yes, she is, Meneer. - This way, please. - Yes, thank you. Here. Good afternoon, Meneer. Hello, Mister Pieter. - Welcome here. - Thank you, miss. There are lots of beautiful girls here. - But you are the most beautiful, miss. - Ahh, Mr. Pieter, you always make me blush since my father was alive. - Please sit down, Mister. - OK. - Oh yes, I brought you something special from Amsterdam. - Thank you, Mister Pieter. Ahhh, a sleeping negligee, thank you again. I heard that the yield of your Coconut, rubber, and coffee plantation are very good. - Yes, quite true. - I am going to be really happy if you want to sell it to me. - Sure, you could. Aren't you, Mr. Pieter Smith our regular customer? Good, we will pay you the best price you can get. Oh yeah, May I speak to you privately? Sure, why not? Go inside girls. I really want to talk about this for a long time... - What is that, sir? - You've been widowed for a long time, right? - Yes. - What if I propose to you to become my wife? - Please, Mr. Pieter, don't kid me around. - No, no, no. no. I'm not kidding, I really want you to become my wife. Mr. Pieter Smith, what do you want at my room this late? Please forgive me. I want to show you a nice thing for you, miss. Yes, but not in this room, it's impolite. I don't know why suddely I feel wanting to give you a gift tonight. But, you would receive it, right? - Come on, take it. - Get the hell out of here! You sir had insulted our madame, you broke our Eastern politeness norm. Leave this room at once! I'm sorry, miss. Sorry for my impudence. Meneer, don't you ever repeat this kind of behavior again. You startled me. - Have you guys heard about what happened last night between Meneer Pieter and Miss Ageng? - Not yet. What was it about? I now am admiring Miss Ageng, such a noble person she is. That's just because the white guy being stupid. Why did he have to crawl into a girl's room? Like a little child! Yeah, and since he he's a rich guy, and also intellectual... comparing him to us? We are nothing. Isun, yes we're nothing to him. but if you did the same thing like he did. You're gonna be fired. As for me, I want to work here a month without pay, but only if I could spend a night with her. Dream like you want guys. I, Isun don't need that kind of wishful thinking. I heard all of your conversation. Good afternoon, miss. Excuse me. - May I take a rest a little while here? - Sure, sure , miss. As you wish, miss. I know your buried desire, now, I give you a chance. Come on, do it. That's it?You only have a strong desire, but without "power". Miss, miss, wait! The "thing" works again. Mmm, I envy you who can have a dirty dream at this time. Kohar, why are you alone here? Where are the others? That's what I've been thinking. Darman and Mahdi hadn't come back here for two days.. Since the incident in the store-room a couple days ago? I'm just worried they are already dead, and we can't find their corpses... - Just like... - Just like the bad luck of that guy who tried to love Miss Ageng? Those incidenst must be inflicted by the same person. Do you --Brother Karto-- have any suspicion on some person? I need to investigate further. Good afternoon, miss. Karto, this is Mr. Broto and his mother. Tomorrow, they are going to work here. - Both of you should rest for now. Come one bring them to their room. - Okay, miss. This way please. Excuse us. Put those up there.! Hey, you, right here! Help, someone's falling. Lift him hurry up. It's not that serious, just some bruises. It won't take a long time to heal. Next time, more aware, okay. Excuse me. Ouw, Miss Ageng, please come in. - I heard Broto got an accident, Mam? - Thank you. - That's true, miss. ut it's nothing serious. - Ah, thanks God. You'd better take some rest, no need to work until you're healed. Thanks, Miss. It's not going to take a long time. - Excuse me to go to the kitchen, miss. - Okay, mam. Ge well soon, okay. - Who's there? - Broto. - What's up? - I need a talk a little while. Come in. I just want to say thank you for your help, miss. I'm okay now. Come here. Your coming is my pleasure too. Sit down. - Is it true your wound healed yet? - Yes. Hey, Sastro, what are you doing? Whoever dares to mess with my future wife, Miss Ageng, will end the life just like you. In short moment, you will become a creature who will obey my command. Every creature and soul living in this universe... ...my Body Controlling Magic, go inside this body. Awake! I will bathe your body with Gold Water... Lie your body... You stand over there! Sastro, Sastro. How many person left that you're going to bring here? One more left, Broto. Starting from now, I don't believe anymore to your magic spells! Why?! Your black magic sucks! Because you haven't conquered Miss Ageng Ayu yet?! I don't need you anymore! Nyai Rangga, come out! Before I kill you! Forgive me, Sastro. Miss Ageng Ayu has a very powerful shield. I can't win over her. My slaves, come alive. You really are not a thankful person, to me, your master. Attack that guy! Wait! Come back here! Everyone go back here I said! You bring your own soul here, young man! Goodbye! Answer me, Ageng. No, Sastro. Don't force me to marry you. What are waiting for? No one in this world is able to prevent my intention! I had killed the obstacles one by one. What do you mean? I was letting intentionally your ex-husband Raden Bagus Sanjaya fell into the canyon. Your father, Raden Permana, was dead drinking the poison I gave him. You a scoundrel, Sastro. A killer! So do all the foremen and bunch of guys who fell in love with you... ...I killed all of them. Including your lover, Broto. How evil you are! In fact, this wealth of yours should be mine since a long time ago. Including yourself. Ageng, now love me... You devil! Don't be impertinent, Sastro! Ageng, come on obey me, Ageng. You can't go anywhere! You little monkey! Take off your pants! - Broto! - Mother! Broto, Miss Ageng was kidnapped by Sastro with a horse-cart. That way! Come with me! Follow me! What are you going to do to me? I will make these statues alive to rape you! And I'm going to explode this cave as your grave. Hey, my slaves! Come alive! When you were alive, you admire and love that woman, aren't you?! I'm giving you a chance right now. Rape her until you are all satisfied. Cruel! Stop that barmy activity! Stop. Kill that guy! Ugly monkey! Hurry, let's get out of here! THE END
