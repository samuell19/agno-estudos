There are more stars than usual. There must be fewer people smoking then. No crickets. Do you hear? No. I don't hear. Are you coming? Did you get the strawberry cider? What time is your parents thing? Late. There's time. Dinner's after 10. So the wait doesn't get that long until 12. I want to take a shower. A shooting star. Make a wish. It smells like cigarettes. You came in earlier. Yeah, I just have a lot of pain in my neck and I had to cancel the meeting. The remote control? What's your name? Wilson Fernandez. Tell me your name. - Wilson. - No nickname. I should go, you know? I understand, but that's not going to happen. Look... I don't know you. I wasn't here. You and I are two strangers. You're right. It was rude of me. Nicola. You already know me. I can't let you go now. She's cute, man. Good for you. Thanks. Put this on. We are going in. What? What do you mean we're going in? I'm already here. I'm not leaving without nothing, I can't let you go. Here. You're not going in with your face uncovered. I can't go in. Listen to me, we're going in together. We're taking the silver, the jewels. If you don't screw it up, in 10 minutes we'll be outside and then we'll split 50/50 and each one on his own. What if I stay here and watch the door? Come in with this. Is it loaded? Yes, it is. But does it have the safety on? Can you shoot it? It can now. It's not for everyone. No... You can't cry inside. If they see you like this, they won't give us anything. You need a war name, what do you want to call yourself? What? Choose whatever you want. What do I call you in there? Napoleon? Not bad, not bad. Napoleon. Breathe. - What? - Breathe. You're too anxious. - Breathe. - Yes. Count from four. Breathe. Four... Three... Two... One... BAD CHRISTMAS - Put your hands up! - Nobody move! Hold still. Napoleon, turn off the TV and close the window. Here's the thing, if you give me everything quickly, we'll leave and in 10 minutes it'll be over. I don't want to spend Christmas Eve here in this house. Napoleon... - Is there anyone else in the house? - No. Are you sure there's no one else in the house? I want to believe you. - Don't lie to me. - No. There's no one else in the house. Take what you want and go. But please don't walk around that you're making a mess of everything. It's just that I came through the garden and you have the grass all dirty. Are all these works of art yours? These are art installations. They're mine. Art installations! Look at you... - Art installations... - Don't touch the works! They're very delicate. If you want something, ask me and I'll give it to you, but I don't want them to be ruined. For me, these works are not yours. They're from the ones who made them. I bought them. Yes, I see. Take what you want, but don't shoot. I have very sensitive ears. Like dogs. Don't worry. It's a silencer. Look. Take this with you. It's an Antognozzi. It's worth more than you can get in a year. It looks like a rug! It's a piece from the non-flying carpet series. It's Antognozzi's best period. It's the most expensive. Take it. Look. In another house they gave me this. It's an hourglass. It's Egyptian. I'm going to give it to you. Time has different speeds for each of us. For you both, even for you, Napoleon, time is passing much slower now than it is for me. That's why this instrument unifies everyone's time. It democratizes it. If you behave yourself, before the last grain of sand falls, I'll leave. We'll leave. Isn't that right, Napoleon? We're going out the window. Or you through the little tube. You decide. Out the window. All right. Where's the safe? There is no safe. Where's the safe? There's no safe. Where's the safe? - I'll take care of it. - What? I'll take care of it. Listen to me, that guy as pretty as you see him, he'll shoot you in the face in a minute. So you better give us the money. Take it easy. Take it easy. - Give me your wallet. - We want the money that's in the safe. - Take it easy. - We want the money in the safe. - You got it? - There is no safe. Give me the money in the safe! - But I'm telling you, there's no safe. - Give me the money in the safe. What safe? The safe you got in 'The son of the faceless man', asshole! Please. Chilean? Let's see... You are wondering what's going on here, right? She's already figured it out. And you, how much time do you need? Who are you? Napoleon. No. No. Napoleon was good while it lasted. - No, no, no. - Yes, yes, yes. - No. Please. - No more Napoleon. - No, no, no. - Yes, yes, yes. Enough. Cachete? Cachete is your name? But Cachete is a much better name than Napoleon! What are you doing here? Forgive me, Juancito, forgive me. What? Are you a thief? Yes. It's his first time, so don't push him too hard. No. I'm not getting it. Are you trying to rob me? No. That way you won't understand anything. You're focused on the wrong sin. Stop it. Are you kidding me? - What are you trying to do? - With what? Calm down, Juan, please. Don't get the wrong idea. You, asshole, you play along with her? But do you understand what's going on here? No... You want to make me jealous with this asshole and we end up with a thief in the house? No. - Come here! - Stop, Juan, stop! Stop, stop! Alicia! No! I told you not to lie to me. This happens because you're liars. Is she dead? Let's go back. The safe. I'll get the key. Let me open it. It's in the book under the sculpture. Inside the book. Next time, the gun goes outside the safe. It's a very common mistake people make. I guess this is not salt. Which way does it go? Through the nose? You put it in the drink. Makes you want to hug people. Look at these modern drugs. The wedding video? What's it doing here? I didn't know it was there. Here. Take this. The wedding ring, Juan? Your wedding ring. I put them together so they don't separate. Now if you don't mind, I'm going to ask you for your cell phones. Yours too. It's on Juan's nightstand. Your cell phone. You probably have two. No. Not with the statue. So, Gladys? When are you coming? Lie down there. Look at you... What's that? This is much better. You're more comfortable this way, aren't you? Well, it was nice meeting you. I'll leave you to it. You have a lot to talk about. Any last wishes? Can you cover up Gladys' body? She looks more like a 'Gladys'. Much more like a 'Gladys' than 'Alicia'. I'm going to look for Alicia. No! Alicia! No! - Please, please, no! - No! Alicia, run! Alicia, run! Alicia! Alicia, run! Alicia! Alicia! Alicia, run! What's wrong? - The neck? - What's the matter with you? What's the matter with you? I know who you are. Are you Santa Claus? Did you come to bring the gifts? I didn't bring any gifts. I have a wish list. Can I give it to you? Then why didn't you leave it on the Christmas tree? So dad won't read it. Gladys told me that Santa is going to read it anyway. Wait here. I'll be right back. What happened with Alicia? Change of plans. Let's go upstairs. What? I can't carry him. He's unconscious. Juan. Juan! Juan! Is he dead? He's unconscious. He hit his head. Juan. He can't hear you. He's going to die because of me. Already with the guilt? So early? "First wish: Celebrate Christmas at home." But we don't have any Christmas cake. So what's the problem? We bake one. My dad won't let me cook. Tonight's a special night. You think he broke his spine? I don't know. We fell down the stairs. He jumped on him. He's crazy. Because he got it wrong. If he had done it right, he would have been a hero. Let's see, Kira. What's so hard for you to understand? She can't play in the living room. These works have knives, glass, electricity. It's dangerous art! Poor thing... Did he find Alicia? I don't know. Did he tie her up? I don't think so. She's not a danger to him. What if he yells at her, gets scared, says something, and the guy reacts? She barely talks to us, and she's going to talk to some guy he doesn't know? He must be running around the house looking for things of value. Sugar, flour, baking powder. It's a combination. Your dad put a combination on it? Yeah, so I don't open it. 20-10. It's my birthday. We're gonna need milk, butter, chocolate. Break the eggs and put them in there. I can't break eggs. Why? Are they too hard? I promise your mom won't get mad. You want to throw one? Well done! Well done! You want to throw more? There we go. This way you aim better. This can't be happening. When I was a child and something ugly happened to me, I closed my eyes, imagined that I was in a nightmare, that it was going to end when I opened them. Try it. Slowly. There you go. And Gladys? Gladys is celebrating Christmas Eve with her family. Did she see you before she left? Almost. You can't make a cake without vanilla extract. I'm gonna ask your mom where it is. Not mommy! Don't worry. When your mom sees you she'll be very happy and she'll hug you. Wait for me here. Where is the vanilla extract? What? Honey, are you okay? Are you okay? I didn't want to cook. You can cook all you want. Why are you crying? Because I'm so happy. You're very chatty. I threw the eggs because Santa told me I could. And when did you see Santa? Oh... Don't worry, you can throw as many eggs as you want. I'll explain to your dad. Okay, mommy, let's let Alicia finish baking her cake. A cake? For me? If anything happens, shout. I love you. The vanilla extract thing was an excuse. I wanted you to see Alicia. Can I call you Kira? Kira is my name. That's why. Kira, I want you to know that Alicia's going to have the best night of her life. We've already given you everything we have of value, what more do you want? It's something she asked for. Then I'm leaving. What did she ask for? I don't know what's going on with Ali, but she's not like this. She's never like this. Please don't do anything to her. We're playing. I wonder if the Antognozzi will be quoted more or less with bloodstains. One never knows. The bloodstain should be the only thing that counts. Look at the shapes that are put together without anyone designing them. Are you interested in art too? I am... I was a plastic artist. Are any of these works yours? No. No. Apparently I'm not in demand. I'm going back to work. "Second wish... ...Change the manger." You're right. These dolls are very ugly. What dolls would you like to put? Are all these dolls yours? Dad chose some dolls for me. You don't like these dolls, do you? Would you like to play... ...at shooting them? You never shot? Is that an orange juice gun? Yes, it is. The firecrackers are starting. Juan. Juan. Can I shoot one more time? Yes, as many times as you like. Are you okay? - Juan... - How are you? Alicia? Calm down. She's okay. In the eye? She is no longer suffering. - Did you see her? - Yes, I did. How is she gonna be okay, for fuck's sake? - Was she scared? - No, no. Alicia, you have a gift. Ali told the guy she wanted to cook. Ali told him? How? In sign language, poor thing? She talks to him. She talks to the guy pretty much. So? How are the daddies doing? Dad, you woke up... Where is Alicia? Alicia's here with me! Ali, how are you? Fine. With Santa. Come here with daddy. Alicia, do you want to say hi to your daddy? Come on, sweetheart. Come here with daddy. Come give him a little kiss. We can't do it now, daddy. See you later. Don't worry. Anyway, you will have to change your clothes for the party. Want me to help? If Alicia walked in, what the hell were you going to do? You look so pretty. It's my party color. Blue. So? What do you think? That's Joseph, the Virgin Mary, the Three Wise Men and their three camels. And that's the little Baby Jesus. Anyway, when dad sees them, he's going to take out all the dolls and put in the old ones. He made her believe he's Santa Claus? I think she believes it all by herself. He made her believe he's Santa Claus. What a sadistic son of a bitch. You made her believe there's a Santa, what are you complaining about? It's a tradition. It's a lie. It's moving. The Antognozzi is moving. Gladys, are you alive? Of course she's alive, asshole. She's not a zombie. You said she was dead. I touched her neck. Did you touch her artery? - I don't know. - Asshole. Gladys, I want to apologize if all these years I wasn't the kind of employer you expected. I know you work hard and take care of things you shouldn't. That's going to change. I swear to you. And I'll give you a raise. Where did you leave the sleigh? The sleigh? It's on the terrace. Can I go to the sleigh? Do you want to leave? Kids aren't allowed to ride on the sleigh. For safety reasons, but we could make a special one for ourselves, what do you think? That mattress could be useful. And we need... ...ropes. - You broke one of dad's sculptures. - Don't worry about it. We're going to have to redecorate the house for the Christmas party anyway. What's that? - I don't know. - It's Ali's favorite song. Now we're going to have to tighten the knots. Are we going too high? We are going to travel through the sky. Release her first. But the guy has the key. There's another set of keys on Kira's nightstand. Grab them. Are you ready? Are you sure? The drawer has a double bottom. Check it out. Stop it! How do you feel? You look better. I'm going to give you this stick and cover your eyes with a blindfold. You will try to find me with the stick. Blind man's buff. That's the name of the game. Go to the window and tell Carbonilla. Don't shout too loud. - Carbonilla! - Louder! Carbonilla! Carbonilla! Fat bastard. He can't hear me. Well, you're gonna have to go down there and warn him. What? No! If the guy comes back and he doesn't find her here, he's gonna blow us all to hell. Can I fly? Gladys, make an effort please. That's crazy. You're gonna get us all killed. No, Gladys. Not on the Antognozzi. If you had balls, you would have taken a chance out there and not put us all in danger. Now it's my fault that Nicola broke in. You call him Nicola, asshole? What is he, your friend? He's a murderer, a psychopath and a degenerate. And of course it's your fault. I'm not sure he's a bad guy, you know? Your daughter looks happy. She laughs and talks. She talks. Gladys, pay attention to me. - Where are you going? - To the bathroom. Don't flush. Gladys, you've got to act fast and tell Carbonilla to call the police. But if the police come, it's going to be a disaster. You have to get in the guy's head. He's got the money, the jewels and he's still messing because he thinks he's in control, when he hears the sirens, he'll run away like a rat. But I can't believe it! Fucking ignorants! It's no big deal, honey. She was playing. She likes the sculptures. But how could you have left her alone, she could have bled to death. It was a small cut, Juan. An injury. Let's see, how many times do I have to tell you? She can't play in the living room! Let's see, what's so hard for you to understand? She can't play in the living room! Let's see, what's so hard for you to understand? Let's see, what's so hard for you to understand? These works have knives, glass, electricity. It's dangerous art! If I'm not here, Alicia is your responsibility. Alicia is your responsibility. ...Is your responsibility. Ali... Ali, my love. Come to daddy, sweetheart. Aren't they going to be cold in there? I don't think so. The earth is warm when it's dumped on you. What do you play with your parents? I like to play... 'Blink first, monkey butt'. And you're good? If I don't blink for a thousand years, I beat mommy, but daddy beats me and mommy beats daddy. Ah, well, then you're even. Yeah, we're tied. Well, this is ready. Let's bury them, lady. Your dad's never gonna find these dolls. But what are you doing? Don't smoke in here. Not in the 'Batistuta'! Are you stupid? - Where are you going? - I need air. and not yours. They're digging a hole in the garden. What do you mean, a hole? What for? I don't know, I can't see. But Alicia is there. Snuggle them up good. No body, no crime. - Oh, no. - What happened? What's going on? He changed her clothes. But are they still there? No. They came in. Hang the rope as it is. Go on. There is no more time Gladys bought them for me, but dad won't let me use them. Oh, what are they? Little lights? - Yes, turn them on from there. - Okay. Wow! Kira, Kira. Don't make a simple knot. It won't hold. Tie a sailor's knot. How the hell do you tie a sailor's knot? Your dad owns a boat and you don't know how to tie a sailor's knot. Strong. Go on. Ouch! What happened? It fell. Holy shit! There's your sailor's knot. Then there's no other choice. Gladys, you're gonna have to jump. No. That's crazy. Kira's right, it doesn't make sense. I believe in Santa. I believe in the guy and I don't think he's gonna hurt Alicia. Wait. Am I the only sane one here? Cachete, look at me. She's my daughter. She's my goddaughter. I pick her up every day from school. I take her swimming. I help her with her homework. And I bathe her every day after working 10 hours, and what the fuck does that have to do with anything? Holy shit. Now this... Listen to me, don't do anything. But let me protect my daughter like I want to, okay? Gladys, you're gonna have to jump. Alicia's depending on you. There's grass down there, it's like a mattress, but natural. Just jump. It's too high. Her knees won't hold her. Don't contradict me, goddamn it. Let her jump at once. - She's going to kill herself! - But a minute ago she was dead! Gladys, I didn't mean that, I'm sorry. Kira, do you believe in me? Do you believe in me as the head of the family? No! Go. Go and see. Are you okay? She's alive. Can she walk? She can walk. Upstairs. Santa, don't scold them. Everything okay? Look at this. What happened? These gifts were given to me 25 years ago. The first house I broke into. Did you change Alicia's clothes? No. She changed herself. In her room. She's a big girl now. Thank you. I told you they were coming. I told you. No! Looks like the cavalry passed by. Who tipped them off? Please don't do anything to us. It's Christmas Eve. It's Christmas Eve downstairs. Here... It's Nightmare's Eve. Poor Gladys. Congratulations. You managed to kill Gladys twice in the same night. We all have problems. We all have problems, but poor people die because of your problems. Come on, Gladys. I'm dying to see you. Kira, I don't want to interfere in your life, but can I ask you a question? You don't want to interfere in her life, bastard? He asked me, Juan. Why are you still with your husband? What the fuck do you care? You want to know why she's with her husband? I'll tell you. For love. For many people he's a scumbag. But what's the greatest act of a scumbag? To be generous. He always treated me like a princess. And I loved him. I love you. So? What happened? Alicia happened. He shut off. Or shut me off. After opening safes for so many years, I learned that people do not keep only the things they consider valuable in the safe. But also those they don't want to see. Many times, the safe doesn't protect, it hides. Kira... - Is that necessary? - Yes, it's necessary. Come, please. See if you guys can make room in there. Sit there, with your two studs. Do you know the story of the lung adagio? Imagine what I'm going to tell you. Close your eyes, otherwise how will you see the images? Some years ago, the classical music composer Felipe Gianmarco, stabbed a folk singer. The knife's narrow, pointed blade, penetrated the right lung, and as it came out of the flaming hole, Felipe heard a sound very similar to that generated by certain wind instruments: A-flat. He whispered as he cleaned the blade on his pants. Then he pointed and punctured the other lung. He removed the knife: A-Sharp. A smaller lung, no doubt. Gianmarco's life changed completely. He composed an adagio. For that, he had to stab and record the exit of air from more than 200 lungs until he got the exact notes for his creation. Before being handcuffed in his own recording studio, Gianmarco made Sgt. Bermudez listen to his work. The policeman, a music lover, closed his eyes, bowed his head and started crying. I'm leaving you this to entertain you. You have a lot to talk about. You could have shot him. You missed a one-time opportunity. I didn't agree, you didn't ask me. It was an extreme situation. Bruce Willis didn't ask everyone on the night at the Nakatomi. Is that the image you have of yourself? You see how you turn everything around? It's impossible to argue with you. What are you laughing at, asshole? You were beautiful. That dress looked beautiful on you. Excuse me, excuse me. May I kiss the bride? Is that a problem? He let me. But I don't understand, you're no longer a faggot? Yes, Juan. I'm gay. Except with your wife. I don't like you, darling. You're not even close to my puppy. I love you, puppy. Kira, I love you. I'd wish you well, but you don't need it because you're the best. The best friend, the best plastic artist, but above all you're going to be the best mom in the world. Oh, Concepcion. I haven't seen her in a long time. We had a fight years ago. I love you very much. I'm gonna miss you. First of all, I want to thank my family for coming all this way. Dad? Where are you? Is my dad here? I love you. I confess that I'm madly in love with you, my husband. You're the best thing that ever happened to me. I, Juan Beckert, would like to thank each and every one of you, for witnessing this beautiful story unfold. And to clarify that here in the tent is a free zone, but I want you to be very careful with the sculptures and art installations that are here in the house. Who is that girl? No idea. A message! Message here! Message! Juan. Juan Brian Beckert. If there is a guy from Avellaneda who could reach such immensity, it is you. Look at you now! You married a hottie! Welcome to the family, Juan! Mom, put the bottle down. But do you know why I drink? Why? Because of your father. To forget about your father. That son of a... Kira's dad. A little message for the bride? No, he's not gonna talk. Bitch... Are you Kira's sister? I'm the stepmother. I want to thank mister Juan for making me feel part of the family and inviting me to this beautiful party. Is that it? Cut. I can't believe they put all this on the video. Look at that look. Not this one. That... That look. Who did this? Who the fuck touched the little angels? I told them not to touch a fucking work! Don't you see what you've done? You, asshole. But, are you stupid? Hey, asshole, stop filming. Stop filming. Stop it. Sons of bitches! You know what? I'm going to tell you something. And I'm going to tell you to your face. You never fucked me properly. With all the money I've put into this. You can't trust anyone. Don't film me anymore. There's the explanation for why they put it in. I forgot you hit a cameraman. Didn't you guys see the video? No. Thank God... I didn't know how it all started. Enough! Party's over! You destroyed the whole house! I said you could do whatever you wanted here, not in the house! I didn't know either. I remembered it differently. Get off! I, Juan Beckert, would like to thank each and every one of you, for witnessing this beautiful story unfold. I, Juan Beckert, would like to thank each and every one of you, for witnessing this beautiful story unfold. You lost. You blinked. Monkey butt. It' s not fair. You're Santa Claus. You can do whatever you want. Anything I want? What about my last wish? Sometimes to get what you want, you have to make a sacrifice. What's sacrifice? I, Juan Beckert, would like to thank each and every one of you, for witnessing this beautiful story unfold. I, Juan Beckert, would like to thank each and every one of you... I would play it back, but I'm tired and I have to leave in a while. We're done, but Alicia has a desire to celebrate Christmas at home. Does anyone object? Ali told me, "Dad doesn't want to celebrate Christmas at home... ...because he's afraid one of my cousins will break one of his art installations". Is this true? Yeah, his cousins are little kids and they don't appreciate those things. Ali learned to value and care for the sculptures because I taught her. Let's go downstairs, it's a last effort. Alicia is happy and wants to celebrate Christmas with those she loves the most, but I can't take you tied up. Can you be good for a while and celebrate as a family without making a mess? But you're not Santa... It's almost over. Can you calm down? Yes, but I told you, you're not Santa. We have to change for the party. Will there be a red coat? I would like to wear a red coat. Can I choose my own clothes? No, I choose your clothes. - You're very pretty. - You're very slutty. Thank you. You look very handsome too. There's no need for this. I'm not going to do anything. That's the idea. What have you done? Me? Nothing. It was Alicia. She had a desire to play with dad's sculptures. Where's Alicia? Where's Alicia? We're going to need plates, glasses and a tray to put the cake Alicia baked. Kira, do you have any cider? No. I think there's some champagne. Bit bitter, but bring it. Bring it anyway. It's all broken. Intervened. The house has been intervened. I'm serious. If I don't see Alicia here, there's not going to be a party. We started out as friends, and I'd like it to end that way. I mean, why don't we take this thing we're living as a life experience for everyone? I found a cider! It's strawberry. It was in the fridge. I don't know what it's doing there. I'm sure it's Gladys'. That's better. She'd love to share it with us. Bring Alicia right away. See who it is. It's Carbonilla. The security guy. Do you want to see Alicia again? Don't play dumb. Anything goes wrong and you never see her again. I swear on Baby Jesus. Do you believe... ...in Baby Jesus? Carbonilla. What a surprise. I heard you were spending Christmas Eve somewhere else and I wanted to check that everything was okay. Everything's perfect. There was a change of plans and we stayed here to celebrate. Thank you so much for asking. Can I come in for a second? Just for routine. Just to be safe. Of course. Sure, come on in. Excuse me. Yes, an artist who's doing a new piece for me. He works on intervening spaces in upper class homes and the works in them. It's not finished yet. Neo-deconstructivism. It's a new trend. You know Cachete. Meet Nicola, Juan's brother. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Mr. Nicola. I'm Carbonilla, the local watchman. How do you do? Nice to meet you. Freeze, man. Freeze or I'll shoot you. Stay. Stay, stay, stay. - Who is this guy? - He's a killer. He's been holding us hostage for hours. He killed Gladys. What? He shot Gladys. He killed her. Gladys? Son of a bitch! No! Son of a bitch! Should I call the police? No. Don't call anyone. Wait. Don't stay here, you'll make a mess of everything. Take him outside, please. Yes, thank you. - It's not right for us to do that. - You can't do that. But stop defending this son of a bitch! Where's Alicia? Kira, go get her upstairs. Go find her in the kitchen or Gladys' room. Ali! Ali! She's not upstairs! She's not downstairs. What do you mean she's not here? What did he do to her? She's gone. She's gone. Alicia! Mom, the watchman was beating up Santa. What's wrong, Cachete? Are you going to kill me? How are you going to say a thing like that in front of the kid? This Carbonilla guy hit me hard. My mistake. Never shake hands with a left-handed gunman. Can I turn on the lights? Yes, honey. You can turn on anything. Santa told me I could break the statues. And also that I could wear pants. You're very pretty. Don't the little lights bother you? No, Ali. I'm not mad. Really. Then why are you crying? Because I'm very happy. Come here. Come here to daddy. You want to go? If she don't want to, she don't want to. If you want you can go and turn on 'The fire rain'. Santa, come and watch me turn on the 'The fire rain'. Okay. It spits fire! All right, all right. Let's just calm down and get this Christmas party started. This is for you... Alicia's gonna toast with a little cider. And I forgot this. Hugging powder. Is the cake good? A little taste, and it might... make us love each other more. To Alicia's party! It's a shot, right? It's anise! - It's absinthe. - It tastes like anise. Okay, it's anise. Does it work? Don't be shy. Do you want to dance? You're feeling a little confused, aren't you? Yes, but my nipples never lie. The noises don't hurt me anymore. It's twelve o'clock. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Do you have any Tom Jones? No, just Italian singers from the '60s and '70s. My name is Nicola Di Bari! Because of a broken little angel, he threw all the people out of his wedding.

Mom, I don't want dad to bathe me. Ali, my love. Come to daddy, sweetheart. Alicia fell asleep. Shall I take her to bed? - I'll take her. - No. Let him take her. - I'll take her. - No! Let him take her. Santa, you forgot the last wish. Don't worry about it. It'll be fulfilled when you wake up. It's too late now. The time has come. Thank you, Nicola. Thank you despite everything.
